The Call's Headquarters,)
Southern Hotel, V
St. Louis, Mo., June 18.)
At ten minutes to 6 o'clock to-night the
booming of cannon in front of the Con
vention Hall announced to the people of
St. Louis that William McKinley of Ohio
had been nominated for President of the
United States by the National Republican
Convention. Following this signal given
by the cannon, the locomotive, mill and
steamboat whistles on the Mississippi
River joined in a shrill screaming. Brass
bands immediately commenced their
noisy parades through the principal
streets. It was just growing dark, and
enterprising and patriotic merchants bred
off rockets and roman candles as the bands
passed.
Although McKinley's nomination was
expected by everybody, the anticipation
of it did not detract in the least from the
great enthusiasm of the crowd in the
Convention Hall, in hotel lobbies and in
the streets.
When the result of the first ballot was
announced, the convention went wild.
Delegates, officers of the convention, re
porters and all, stood up and cheered lus
tily. Hats, fans, handkerchiefs and papers
were thrown into the air. Umbrellas
were raised and whirled.
The immense portrait of McKinley that
had adorned the south wall of the conven
tion hall was carried to the center of the
Auditorium, and a great crowd of cheering
delegates and spectators made a mad rush
to the center of the building. The won
derful popularity of McKinley had never
before been made so apparent.
After the speech of Foraker, who placed
McKinley in nomination, the delegates
and spectators cheered lustily for more
than ten minutes. The band would occa
sionally strike â¢up "Marching Through
Georgia," "Columbia the Gem of the
Ocean," "The Red, White and Blue" and
"Yankee Doodle," trying to quell the up
roar, but no sooner had the band finished
one air than the immense congregation of
nearly 14,000 people would take up the re
frain and sing with a volume that shook
the rafters of the convention ball. The
racket would then almost subside, but
would again be precipitated by the Ohio
men in the gallery, who manipulated a
huge canvas crayon portrait of McKinley.
Finally the great crowd, having tired
itself out, subsided and business was pro
ceeded with.
The first two days of the convention
were quiet enough. There was not much,
noisy demonstration. But to-day's ses
sion was marked by scenes which will live
in the memory of all spectators. The
whole city is talking to-night about tbe
wonderful popularity of the Republican
candidate for President. Bands . followed
by crowds are parading the downtown
streets; rockets and roman candies il
luminate the sky in every direction.' Sel
dom before has a Presidential candidate
been nominated under such auspicious
circumstances.
All good Republicans are in line. The
friends of Reed, Allison, Morton and Quay
are as hearty in their enthusiasm for
Major McKinley as if they had not es
poused the candidacy of their own favor
ites, f
Each of the chief supporters of other
candidates, namely Lodge, Baldwin, Hen
derson, Hastings and Depew, seconded
the motion to make the nomination unani
mous. Every one of these seconds was
received with deafening cheers, and it was
with the utmost difficulty that the chair
man could make himself heard.
At 10 o'clock this morning, the hour set
for convening, the chairs of the great hall
were not half filled, and it was 10:30 o'clock
before the convention arose for prayer,
offered by a colored minister. The scene
at this time was an inspiring one. Four-
teen thousand people, men and women,
stood up and with bowed heads listened to
the fervent exhortation of the old colored
man. WBm
An idea of the immense area of the con-
vention ball will be conveyed to readers of
The Call when it is stated that specta-
tors in the remote gallery corners could
not hear the words of the loudest speakers.
A Call correspondent went into a corner
of the gallery and looked down . upon the
great congregation, a perfect sea of faces.
Those on the platform could hardly be
distinguished, while the faces of those in
the opposite gallery could not be discerned
at all. The voices of speakers on the plat
form sounded far off and even the music
of the band came faintly enough to occu
pants of the corners of the galleries. Res
idents in the vicinity of the convention
hall said that the cheering of 14,000.voices
could be heard six blocks distant. Seldom
in the history of National political conven
tions has there gathered such an immense
and enthusiastic concourse of people.
Thousands of fans waving in the great
hall, the brilliant colors of flags, festoons
and feminine apparel, made the scene an
animated one. It was worth a thousand
mile* trip just to seethe immense sea of
human faces, all animated, all earnest and
enthusiastic lor the Republican standard
bearer, and to hear tbem cheer. What
pulse could beat slowly when 14,000 voices
cheered for the great Ohioan, while the
band played patriotic airs? Every man of
them was glad to witness such a sublime
spectacle, and every man was glad he was
a member of the great Republican- party.
Ex-Senator Ingalis of Kansas, who has
attended many National conventions of
his party, and who sat in the press reserve,
said he had never witnessed a more thrill
ing or enthusiastic scene than after Foraker
haa nominated McKinley. .'.; YY .'â¢â¢ . ,-= .'.

CONVENTION HALL, ST. LOUIS. Mo.,
June 18.â When the president directed the
call of States for nominations for the
Presidency, the first State to respond was
lowa, when R. M. Baldwin of Council
Bluffs came to tbe platform and nom
inated Senator W. B. Allison of lowa.
BALDWIN NAMES ALLISON.
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: There is one,
but only one of those whose names will be
presented to this convention who can claim
that there has been placed for him in history's
golden urn an estimate of his character and
worth made by him in whom Nature stamped
her royal seal; whom God exhibited as his
greatest design of American manhood, genius,
statesmanship and patriotism; who, now in
heaven, wears a crown of deathless praise, and
whose great soul is a- portion of eternity
itselfâ James G. Blame.
â¢ Blame, writing to' Garfield, said: "Then
comes Allison. He is true, kind, reasonable,
- fair, honest and good. He is methodical, in-
dustrious and intelligent, and would be a
splendid man to sail along with, smoothly and
successfully." y". . .-I,";. .
Complying with the request of the lowa dele-
gation, I rise to propose to this convention the
nomination of him to whom this heritage was
bequeathedâ B. Allison, and to ask
you to make it on the old and new testament
of Republicanism. It takes a big man to repre-
sent the State of lowa in the Congress of the
United States for thirty-five years, but Senator
Allison is that man. With the most perfect
knowledge of the details of all ' our political
laws and their* histories, with ' that statesman-
like judgment which distinguishes the essen-
tial from the accidental, and the immutable
from the transitory, "With every look a cordial
smile, every gesture a caress," yet with a spirit
of such firm mold and purpose that no bribe
or feast or palace could awe or swerve, he has
fdr thirty-fivo years, upon the floor of the
House and Senate, been fighting tor the inter-
ests of the people; carrying onward and up-
ward the Nation's legislative work; turning
cranks out of place, unsphering the culminat-
ing stars of Democracy; Unmasking the hidden
purposes of corrupt measures, until now he
holds the place of ungrudged supremacy in the
legislative halls of that most splendid of Capi
tols. . \ V
' That which this country has lost is that
which it now seeks, "protection." To .get it
they worked hard, prayed fast, paid high, and
now let them have it. Allison does not believe
in a tariff for revenue only, but in a tariff for
protection and revenue jointly. .; He has always
insisted that the protective system ;is the
mightiest instrument for the development of
our natural resources and the strongest agent
to, protect American wealth and American
labor. Protection built the laborer his Ameri-
can home, and he will never again welcome
therein Democratic sirens singing i free trade
songs written and composed by English bards;
for, having chiseled the principles of ' protec
tion in his hearthstone, he will at j the next
election defend them at his front gate.
The great and Important Issue which is just
now coming around, the corner is the one of
sound money, and we can no more dodge it
than we can gravitationâ and sound money
means the courageous maintenance of our
present gold standard until changed by in-
ternational agreement.
In this respect the situation is easily simple,
but certainly serious.. A decision upon y this
important question must be made by this con-
vention, and remember, gentlemen, a j nation
listens to catch the click of its fate. For Sena-
tor Allison you cannot build too strong a plat-
form for sound money, and it you place him
upon it he will see to it that the dry rot of 16
to 1 does not steal ' through j its timbers. The
United States can no ' more make good money
Dy simply placing its symbol of sovereignty or
mark of authority on any kind of i metal, re
gardless of its commercial value or relations
to foreign countries, that it can extend its do
main by calling a furlong a mile.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 19, 1896.
He believes that the American dollar should
have some grains of sense as well as more of
silver; that there can be no stability to our
currency or money if we keep adopting such
shifting policies as that under them the same
piece may be a copper cent in one hand or a
dollar in another. | He believes that unlimited
coinage would soon lead to unlimited bank
ruptcy. No honest farmer would borrow from
his neighbor a bushel of 50-cent wheat and
insist upon paying him back with a bushel of
25-cent oats, and so this great Government
cannot expect to Keep its credit at the highest
point if it borrows a dollar and insists upon
paying back with 50-ce.nt silver, any other
construction of the word "coin" in any laws or
contracts to the contrary notwithstanding. ,"
The platform of this convention must be for
sound money, and in clear, ringing, unmis
takable terms. On any other construction of
it the party may get into \ power, but the coun-
try would be in danger of falling, into the
batch of bankrupt governments and at the
end of the party's administration it would
probably have no more of an estate than did
Rabelais, whose will, when opened, read: "In
the name of God, amen. I have nothing, i I
owe much. I give the rest to the poor."
At a time when a nation wildly looks at an
other nation, standing with mute lips apart,
Allison did not meet with clinched fist the
proffered hand of ; lnternational, adjustment.
However, he has stood unwaveringly by the
Monroe doctrine and insisted that the United
! States should reeoenize any people struggling
for liberty and republican institutions, even
if they are insurgents in Cuba. I ask you to
; nominate him. li you do, the people from the
sand-enshrouded Mexican line to the life wire
that separates us from an unborn daughter on
the north will shout as in one glorious, glad
anthem, ."The old temple of Republicanism
still stands. Flock to it for shelter."
If you do, every keynote of the campaign
will be kept at concert pitch. If you do, the
White House will be used*, no longer as an ex
periment station. Nominate him and a thrill
of joy will go from the West to the East, carry
ing on its trembling way the songs of our
reapers, only to be lost in the roars |of your
furnaces. Nominate him, and when our corn
grows old in autumn's time, when our flocks
are teeming and our granaries are full, every
spindle will be turning day and night upon
the Merrimac
The speech was an eloquent one and
was loudly applauded at some points.
LODGE NOMINATES REED.
The next State to respond was Massa-
ysV: Garrett A. Ilobart, nominated by the Republican party for the Vice-Presidency of the United States,, was born at Long Branch, N. J., in 1844. He graduated from Rutger's
College before he was 20 years of "'and studied law with Socrates Tuttle at Paterson, being admitted to the* bar in 1866. y
In 1872 he was elected a member of â  the New Jersey House and was re-elected and was chosen Speaker. â - He declined an election in 1873, and In 1877 was elected ; Sena-
tor from Passaic County. ; He was re-elected to this position and served in the office from that time until the expiration of the y year 1882, being President pro tern, of the
body for the last two years of which he was a member. In 1884 he was nominated for United States Senator, but was not elected.
In 1884 he became a member of the Republican Committee. In business life he has been active and energetic. He is the president of two water companies,
the Paterson Railroad Companies' Consolidated lines, Morris County Railroad and the People's Gas Company. SSsf_3f_B^^_^@H '^" ' 'â â 'â¢''^B_
He long ago won his spurs among the National leaders of the Republican party for his brains and political acumen. It was ;he who originated the idea of running
Griggs for Governor and carried his idea through with brilliant success. i; Three weeks before that election he predicted: "We shall win by 20,000 or nothing." Even y; the
most sanguine of bis friends laughed at him, but when the v ictory was won he was overwhelmed with congratulations, and his boom for the Vice-Presidency was launched. ;
chusetts, and Senator ;,: Lodge nominated
Thomas B. Reed for the Presidency in the
following speech:
Four years ago we met jas we meet now,
representatives of the great Republican party.
Prosperity was in the land. Capital was con
fident and labor employed. There was the
good day's wage for the good day's work, and
the spirit of American enterprise was stirring
and bold. The treasury was full, the public
revenues ample for the public need., ;. We were
at peace with all the world and had';, placed a
prudent hand on the key of the Pacific.
Four short years have come and gone.' Look
about you now. The treasury is empty. - Our
credit is impaired. Our revenues are deficient.
We meet the; public needs not with income'
but by borrowing at high rates and pledging
the future for the wants of the present.
Business is paralyzed. Confidence y has
gone. Enterprise has folded its eagle
wings; and mopes and blinks' in the market
place. Our . mills are idle and our railroads
crippled. Capital hides itself and labor idly
walks the street. There is neither a good day's
wage nor a goods day's work. We have met
slights abroad and have serious differences
with other nations. The key of the Pacific has
slipped from nerveless bauds. Foreign troops
have been landed in this hemisphere. Our
own boundaries have been- threatened in
Alaska. The Monroe doctrine has been de
fended, but is not yet vindicated. The people
of a neighbor island, fignting for freedom, look
toward us with imploring eyes, and look in
vain. The American policy which would pro
tect our industries at home and our flag abroad
has faded and withered away. . :
â¢';. Look then upon that picture and then ou this.
* * â  * â  Could you on that fair mountain leave
to feed and fatten on this moor? . '
But four short years have come and gone,
and they have brought this change. What has
happened? I will tell you in a word. The
Democratic party has been in power. That is
the answer.
y Upon us falls the heavy burden of binding
up these wounds and bringing relief to all
this suffering. The Democrats deceived the
people by promising them the millennium
and the miserable results of those lying prom
ises are all about us to-day. We have no
promises to make. We pledge ourselves only
to that which we believe we can perform. We
will do our best. That is all. And, as in 1860
we saved the Union and abolished slavery, so
now in- 1896 we will deal with this Demo
cratic legacy of blunders, 'bankruptcy and
misfortune.
.We are gathered here to choose the next
President of the United States. That we will
win in the election no man doubts. But let
us not deceive ourselves with the.pleasant
fancy that the campaign is to be an easy one.
It will be a hard battle; it cannot be other
wise when so much depends upon the result.
Against the Republican party, representing
fixed American policies, strength, progress
and order, will be arrayed not only that or
ganized failure, the Democratic party, but all
the wandering forces of political chaos and
social disorder.
GARRETT A HOBART.
. It is not merely the . Presidency which is set
before us as the prize. The : prosperity of the
country, the protection of our industries, the
soundness of our currency and the National
credit are all staked on the great issue i to be
decided at the polls next November. Upon us
rests the duty of rescuing the country from the
misery : into which it has been ' plunged by
three years of Democratic misrule. [â¢.
To drive the Democrats from power is the
first step and the highest duty, but we shall
triumph in vain, and in our turn shall meet
heavy punishment at the hands of the people
If we do not [ put our victory Jto right j uses.
Such a crisis as this cannot be met and dealt
with by shouts and enthusiasm. We must face
it as our fathers 'â  faced slavery and disunionâ
with a grim : determination to win the battle,
and, that done, to take up our responsibilities
in the same , spirit ; with which we won the
fight. Now, as then, we can hope to succeed
only by the most strenuous endeavor; and
now, as then, everything depends upon the ad
ministration we place in office.
We : want a President who will meet this
situation . as Lincoln met that of 1861â
thechielsof the Republicans about him and
with party and people at his back.
We want a President who on the sth day of
next March will summon Congress in extra
session and, refusing to make appointments or
to deal with patronage, will say that all else
must wait until Congress sends to him a tariff
which shall put money in the treasury and
wages in the pockets of the American working
men. -
We want a President who will protect at all
hazards the gold reserve of the treasury, who
will see to it that no obligation of the Govern
ment is presented which is not paid In what
ever coin the creditor chooses to demand, and
who will never forget that the nation which
pays with honor borrows with ease.
We want a man who will guard the safety
and dignity of the Nation at home and
abroad, and who will always and constantly
be firm and strong in dealing with foreign
nations, instead of suddenly varying a long
course of weakness and indifference with a
convulsive spasm of vigor and patriotism.
Above all, we want a man who Will lead his
party and act with it and who will not by
senseless quarrels between the White House
and the Capitol reduce legislation and execu
tion alike to imbecility and failure.
Such is the man we want for our great office
in these bitter times, when the forces of dis
order are loosed and the wreckers with their
false lights gather at the shore to lure the ship
of state upon the rocks. Such a man fit for
such deeds lam now to present to you. He
needs no praise from me, for he has proved his
own title to leadership. From what he is and
what he has done we know what he can do.
For twenty years, in victory and defeat, at the
head of great majorities and of small minori
ties alike, he has led his party in Congress with
a power which no man could dispute and with
an ability which never failed.
I have seen him with a maddened opposi
tion storming about him carry through that
great reform which has made the House of
Representatives the strong and efficient body
it is to-day. I have seen him during the past
winter guide a great majority so that they
have met every demand put upon them, and
made no errors which could burden the Re
publican party in the campaign before us.
Before the people and in the House he has
ever been the bold and brilliant champion of
the great Republican policies which, adopted,
have made us prosperous; and, abandoned,
have left ruin at our doors. He is a thorough
American by birth, by descent, by breeding;
one who loves his country and has served it in
youth and manhood,; in war; and -in peace.
His great ability, his originality of thought,
his power in debate, bis strong will, are
known of all men and are part of the history of
the last twenty years. His public career is as
spotless AS his private ' character is pure and
unblemished. He is a trained statesman fit
for the heaviest task the country can impose
upon him. He commands the confidence of his
party and his country. He is a leader of meu.
We know/It because we have seen him lead.
To those who have followed him he never said
"Go," but always "Come." He is entirely
fearless. We know it, for ; we have seen his
courage tested on a .hundred fields. He has
been called to great .places and to great .trials
and he has never failed nor flinched. He is
fit to stand at the head of the Republican
column. He is worthy to be an American
President.
I have the honorâ the very great honorâ to
present to you as a candidate for your nomina
tion the Speaker of the National House of
Representatives, Thomas B. Reed of Maine.
SECONDED BY LITTLEFIELD.
Reed's nomination was loudly ap
plauded, many of the delegates rising
and waving flags amid much cheering.
The nomination was seconded ,by Charles
E. Littlefield of Rockland, Me. Mr. Lit
tie field said:
In the nominee of this convention will be
the next President of the Republic. That the
Republican party is victorious in the coming
campaign, whoever its candidate may be, has
lone since been settled by the manifold blun
dersâ^worse than crimesâ that have been com
mited by the Democratic party. It has demon
strated its incapacity to direct the affairs of
the Nation in full measure, heaped up, running
over. It was intrusted with power by a forget
ful and forgiving people at a time of unex
ampled prosperity, with an overflowing Na
tional treasury, unlimited public credit, all
labor fully and profitably employed wheels
turning, looms moving, furnaces glowing and
machinery hummingâ the music that attends
profitable, diversified industry. These were
the inevitable results of the intelligent appli
cation of that elemental principle of our sys
tem of government, coeval with the birth
agony oi theÃepublicâ protection to American
labor and industry.
The Democratic party, after having de
nounced the McKinley tariff as the "culminat
ing atrocity of a class legislation, set forth
its declaration of alleged principles, asking for
a change of administration and party in order
that there might be a "change of system and a
change of method." We have a change in ad
ministration and party, a change of system
and method, and a complete reversal of results.
In 1896 we see the perfect converse of the pic
ture presented in 1892.. In that great achieve
ment of Democratic statesmanship the con
fessed misbegotten offspring of cowardice,
perfidy and dishonor, a tariff for deficiency
only, "Professor" Wilson declared he had just
begun to "shell the protected industries of the
North."
The opening gun of his campaign was suffi
cient to drive timid capital to inaccessible
spots, extinguish the fires, silence the looms,
paralyze industry, turn honest labor into the
street and plunge the country into a con
dition of , business depression hitherto un-
known to this generation of business men. It
encouraged: and cherished foreign and de-
stroyed domestic industry. It has fostered no
industry as it has "that of the Sheriff." Then
the Â« sunshine 'of \ prosperity ; illuminated the
whole land. * Now our people grope, shiver
and waits in the benumbing shadow of ad-
versity and distress. Even Cleveland has dis-
covered that we are confronted by a condition
of business depression. Then a surplus over-
flowed the treasury; â . now a dificit drains its
vaults. . :^f_|S^BH
. The stern logic -of events has given the
American people a logic lesson on the most
stupendous scale. But one lesson is taught.
It is so plain that "he may run that readeth
it." Another change is decreed. It only
waits the slow turning of the hand on the dial-
plate of time to be \ registered. For the next
four years the Republican party will again
take charge of the business of the country.
Will it remain in power for decades, shaping
in harmony with its high destiny the policy
of the Republic? The action of this conven
tion in selecting ft nominee will determine.
We stand here as the representatives of this
great party, charged with the responsibility of
deciding whether the lease of power, which
an indignant, exhausted, exasperated people
stand ready to give us, shall be for years or
decades. We are called upon to act for the
welfare of the whole party, not to express per-
sonal preferences. The occasion demands our
greatest man, our foremost leader. He should
not be the representative of any special policy
or any single principle of the party. He must
be the representative of all interests, all ele
ments, ail sections. He must know no North
and no South, no East and no West. He ; must
have ft private life and a public record, of the
lawful, flawless, untarnished by suspicion, un-
sullied by calumny, a life upon which the cal
cium light of a campaign can cast no shadow.
He must have opinions and the courage to
declare them, and when he has only declared
them to "stand," like Luther, if need be, for-
ever. He must have commanding ability, in-
tegrity above suspicion. He must be unswerv
ingly loyal to all the principles of the party.
He must have Â» thorough knowledge of the
science of practical government, an intelligent
apprehension of the true destiny of the repub
lic, a sincere purpose, a manly independence,
a freedom from obligations, entanglements and
alliances. He must be unselfish in his devotion
to the welfare of the whole party, Inflexible in
determination, indomitable in courage. He
must have Americanism broad enough and
rugged enough to maintain the dignity of: the
Kepublio and the rights of its citizens In every
land and on every sea; an Americanism that
with a due regard to international duties can
extend .the hand of sympathy to our fellow-
men wherever they are struggling for freedom ;
an Americanism that does not look upon the
flag as a piece of mere textile fabric, but sees
in it the emblem of a great and powerful peo
ple consecrated to liberty and freedom by the
expenditure of uncounted treasure and the
sacrifice of innumerable heroic and ; patriotic
lives.
I oome to you from a State that has always
followed in victory or defeat the standard of
the party, that ever since the party was born
of its aspirations for freedom has cast its vote
for its candidates; that will cast Its vote for
the nominee of this convention, whoever he
may be, and I bring to you a candidate who by
his twenty years of battle for the party in the
House of Representatives has demonstrated
his possession of these qualifications in a pre
eminent degree. He has rendered conspicu
ous and enduring service to the party and the
Nation, service that was not within the power
or ability of any other to render. . He trampled
under foot immemorial precedent in order that
the party that had been entrusted by the
country with the transaction of its business
might discharge its duties and see that the
business of the country was done.
The universal practice of the Republican
nd Democratic parties had been such as to
Justify the statement of Mills in speaking of
the Democracy, "that we propose to exercise
control oi the House, just as much as if we
were still in the majority, because we know
that- our minority is strong enough to make
us virtual rulers," resulting in a government
of the minority and not of the majority, a com
plete subversion of the fundamental principle
of representative government. . , ;
With this condition he was confronted at
the assembling of the Fifty-first Congress. He
found the House of j Representatives . & body of
obstruction. He made It a deliberative, legis
lative, business body.' He . found It a biasing
and & by-word. He made It the instrument of
the people's will, one of the glories of the Re
public. /-'.-'
, A determined minority stood like a lion in
its path to thwart and defeat, but it made it
possible for the Republican party to fulfill its
pledges to tbe people.
But for bis overmastering courage and in
flexible determination, the McKinley bill would
have been nothing but a legislative dream.
The most venomous, rancorous and vitupera
tive - abuse known to partisan hatred was
poured upon him by a defeated, baffled, ex
asperated minority. He became the center of
a whirlwind ot denunciation and calumnia
tion the country over. , His political future
was staked upon the Issue. He never hesi
tated to count the cost. ' Conscious of the ret
titude and patriotism of his purpose, calm,
serene, self-reliant, undismayed, indomitable,
massive, heroic, the great Speaker towered
above it all, an impregnable bulwark against
which "the gates of hell Could not prevail."
He lived to emerge unscathed from the ava
lanche of partisan detraction and cation,
and see his position sustained by the greatest
legal tribunal of the civilized world, and he
had the proud satisfaction of witnessing the
humiliation of his detractors and calumnia
tors when they were compelled to adopt his
rules.
As true as the needle to the pole has been
his devotion to the principles of honest and
sound finance. His record for sound money
is without a break. Be believes in sound
finance and in sound finance with a definition.
He believes in a definition that defines.
He is willing that his definition should be
known of all men, and his definition 'is tbat
until we can have bimetallism by interna
tional. agreement the present gold standard
should be maintained. He believes that any
other principle means disaster and a loss of the
confidence of the great business Interests of

DEPEW NOMINATES MORTON.
When the Stateof New York was called,
Mr. Sutherland of Rochester rose and said
that the name of New York's favorite son
would ihe presented by another "favorite
son )of that State and of all the ' States,
Chauncey M. Depew." A round of cheers
greeted Mr.' Depew as he made his way toDECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
The Republicans of the United States, assembled by their representatives in Na
tional Convention, appealing for the popular and historical justification of their claims
to the matchless achievements of thirty years of Republican rule, earnestly and con
fidently address themselves to the awakened intelligence, experience and conscience
of their countrymen in the following declaration offsets and principles:
For the first time since the Civil War the American people have witnessed the
calamitous cor.sequences of full and unrestrained Democratic control of the Govern
ment. It has been a record of unparalleled incapacity, dishonor and disaster. In ad
ministrative management it has ruthlessly sacrificed indispensable revenue, entailed
an unceasing deficit, eked out ordinary current expenses with borrowed money, piled
up the public debt by $262,000,000 in time of peace, forced an adverse balance of trade,
kept a perpetual menace hanging over the redemption fund, pawned American credit
to alien syndicates and reversed all the measures and results of successful Republican
rule. In the broad effect of its policy it has precipitated panic, blighted industry and
trade with prolonged depression," closed factories, reduced work and wages, halted
enterprise and crippled American production while stimulating foreign production
for the American market. Every consideration of public safety and individual interest
demands that the Government shall be rescued from the hands of those who have
shown themselves incapable of conducting it without disaster at home and dishonor
abroad, and shall be restored to the party which for thirty years administered it with
unequaled success and prosperity.
A PROTECTIVE TARIFF.
â¢ We renew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection as the bulwark
of American industrial independence and the foundation of American development
and prosperity. This true American policy taxes foreign products and encourages
borne industry; it puts the burden of revenue on foreign goods, it secures the Ameri
can market for the American producer; it upholds the American standard of wages
for the American workingman; it puts the factory by the side of the farm, and makes
the American farmer less dependent on foreign demand and price; it diffuses general
thrift and founds the strength of all on the strength of each. In its reasonable appli
cation it is just, fair and impartial, equally opposed to foreign control and domestic
monopoly, to sectional discrimination and individual favoritism.
We denounce the present Democratic tariff as sectional, injurious to the public
credit and ' destructive to business enterprise. We demand such equitable tariff on
foreign imports which come into competition with American products as will not only
furnish adequate revenue for the necessary expenses of the Government, but will pro- ,
tect American labor from degradation to the wage level of other lands. We are not
pledged to any particular schedules. The question of rates is a practical question, to
be governed by the conditions of the time and of production; the ruling and uncom
promising principle is the protection and development of American labor and indus
try. The country demands a right settlement, and then it wants rest.
RECIPROCITY WITH OTHER NATIONS
We believe the repeal of the reciprocity arrangements negotiated by the last
Republican administration was a national calumity, and we demand their renewal
and extension on such terms as will equalize our trade with other nations, remove the
restrictions which now obstruct the sale of American, products in the ports of other
countries and secure enlarged markets for the products of our farms, forests and
factories.
Protection and reciprocity are twin measures of Republican policy, and go hand in
hand. Democratic rule has recklessly struck down both, and both must be re-estab
lished. Protection for what we produce, free admission for the necessaries of life
which we don't produce, reciprocal agreements of mutual interest which gain
open markets for us in return for our open market to others. Protection builds up
domestic industry and trade and secures our own market for ourselves. Reciprocity
builds up foreign trade and finds an outlet for our surplus.
PROTECTION TO STJOAR PRODUCERS.
We condemn the present administration for not keeping faith with the sugar pro
ducers of this country. The Republican party favors such protection as will lead to
the production on American soil of all the sugar which the American people use, and
for which they pay other countries more than $100,000,000 annually.
"WOOL AND 'WOOLENS.
To all our productsâ to those of the mine and the field, as well as to those of the
the platform and proceeded to put in
nomination Governor Levi P. Morton. He
did so in these words:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: National Republican Conventions have
been epoch-makers. They have formulated the
principles, originated the policies and sug
gested the measures which in the history of the
United States form its most progressive pe
riods. They have nominated for the Presi
dency statesmen and soldiers, who were the
leaders of the people in their onward march to
larger liberty and broader industrial condi
tions.
No party, no matter however glorious its
achievements or how brilliant its success, can
rely upon the past, Its tormer triumphs are
only its certificates of character, which must
be met by continuing effort as beneficent and
wise as anything of which it boasts. The party
which is to permanently govern a country and
is secure in its past must not only be equal to
the present, but must forecast and provide for
the future. The Republican party has held
possession of the Government of the United
States for more than a generation, because it
has triumphantly met these conditions.
The unequaled successes of the Republican
party, iv hold upon the country and its mas
terful influence upon affairs have been due to
the fact that in every crisis its principles have
solved the problems of the hour and its se
lected leader has been the man for the occa
sion. The greatest moral and patriotic ques
tions which a free people were ever called
upon to meet were slavery and secession in the
cany days of our organization. But with
"Union and Liberty" as our watchword and
with Lincoln as our leader we saved the Re
public and emancipated the slave. The pas
sionate and critical issues of reconstruction
were successfully met and the hostile sections
happily united by a policy of conciliation
which could only secure the consent of the
victors and the assent of the conquered by the
influence of the soldier President wno had the
confidence of the armies wnich he \ had led in
triumph and the enemies whom he had paroled
with honor. In a period when progress halted
because of the distrust of commonwealths and
their citizens of each other the later and bet
ter judgment of the country expressed Its ac
knowledgment to the non-partisanship and
judicial fairness of Hayes and Evarta.
The youth who came to manhood after the
civil war and knew little of its agonies or its
animosities found a glorious example of
American possibility and achievement in the
canal driver, the college student, the school
principal, the college president, the Union
general, the illustrious debater in the House of
Representatives, . the brilliant and magnetic
Garfield. In defeat and in victory, for the
policies which stood for the development of
American industries, for America for Ameri
cans whether native or naturalized, and for
the reciprocity which bound the North Ameri
can and South American continents together,
we had. the plumed knight oi our enthusiasm
and our love, James G. Blame. As a new gen
eration came to majority, to whom the
past was a legend, the present, the difficult
task of development and prosperity and the
future theory without experience, the Repub
lican party again happily practiced, in its con
trol of the executive and legislative branches
of the Government, that policy of the protec
tion of American industries and that practice
of sound finance which gave to the Republic
its era of ereatest prosperity and its period of
the largest returns for capital, the fullest em
ployment for labor and the highest wages for
work in the history of our Nation in the clos
ing year of the administration of - that able
and accomplished statesman, Benjamin Har
rison.
A few weeks preceding the convention of
four years ago at Minneapolis I had an after
noon with Mr. Blame. With marvelous ; in
tuition he forecast the future. He said:
"Substantially all the forces of opposition, of
distrust and of disappointment, of theory and
of imagination which accumulate -against a
party that has been in power for; over thirty
years are now concentrated for an assault
upon our position, and are certain to succeed.
The Democratic party and Its allies of Popu
lism and of all other isms are destined in this
campaign, no matter who is our candidate or
what is our platform, to secure possession of
the Government." The country knows; to its
loss, Its sorrow and its grief, that the predic
tion has been fulfilled In every part. In its
fulfillment the United States has the ex
perience and Europe has the business and
prosperity. JffpSÃÃpin9
We meet to take up the, broken cord of Na
tional development and happiness and link it
once more to the car of progress. Our industries
stagnant, our manufactures paralyzed, our
agriculture disheartened, our - artisans unem
ployed, our- finances < disordered, our â¢ treasury
bankrupt, our credit impaired,' our position
among the nations of the world questioned, all
look to this convention and call upon its
wisdom for hope and rescue.
The conditions created by the practice of
Democratic policies, the promise of Democratic
measures and tne differences of Democratic
statesmen would seem to argue an unques
tioned and overwhelming triumph for the Re
publican party in the coming election. No
matter how brilliant the promise, no matter j
how serene the outlook, it is the part of I
wisdom, with the uncertainties of politics and j
our recent experience of the tragic shiftiug of
issues, to be careful, prudent and wise in plat
form and in candidate.
The last few years have been a campaign of
university extension among the people of the
United States, and while we may in platform
and candidate meet all the requirements of
party obligations and party expectations, we
must remember that there is a vast constitu
ency which has little fealty to parties or to or
ganizations, but votes for the man and the
principles which are in accord with their views
in the administration of the country. The
whole country, north, south, east and west,
without any division in our lines, or out of
them, stands, after what has happened in the
last three years, for the protection of American
industries, for the principle of reciprocity and
for America for Americans. But a compact
neighborhood of great commonwealths, in
which are concentrated the majority of the
population, of the manufactures and of the
industrial energies of the United States, has
found that business and credit exist only with
the stability of sound money.
It has become the fashion of late to decry
business as unpatriotic. We hear much of the
"sordid considerations of capital," "employ
ment," "industrial energies" and "prosperous
labor." The United States, differing from the
medieval conditions which govern older
countries, differing from the militarism which
is the curse of European nations, differing
from thrones which rest upon the sword, is
pre-eminently and patriotically a commercial
and a business nation. Thus commerce and
business are synonymous witn patriotism.
When the farmer is afield sowing and reaping
the crops which find a market that remuner
ates him for his toil, when the laborer and
the artisan find work seeking them and not
themselves despairing of work, when the wage
of the toiler promises comfort for his family
and hope for his children, when the rail Is
burdened with the product of , the soil and of
the factory, when the spindles are humming
and the furnaces are in blast, when â¢ the mine
is putting out its largest product and the
national and individual wealth is constantly
increasing, when the homes owned unmort
gaged by the people are more numerous day
by day and month by month, when the schools
are most crowded, the fairs most frequent and
happy conditions most universal in the Nation,"
then are the promises fulfilled which make
these United States of America the home of the
oppressed and the land of the free.
It is to meet these conditions and to meet
them with a candidate who represents them
and about whom there can be no question.* that
New York presents to you for the Presidency
under the unanimous instructions of two suc- '
cessive Republican State conventions the
name of her Governor, Levi P. Morton.
New York is the cosmopolitan State of the
Union. She is both a barometer and ther
mometer of the changes of popular opinion
and popular passion. She has been the pivotal
commonwealth which has decided nearly every
one of the National elections in this genera
tion. She has more Yankees than any city, in
New England, more Southerners than any
community in the South and more native-born
Westerners than anycity in the West and the
representatives of the Pacific Coast within her
borders have been men who have done much
for the development of that glorious region.
These experienced and cosmopolitan citizens
with their fingers upon the pulses of finance
Â»nd trade of the whole country, feel instantly
the -conditions that lead to disaster or to pros
perity. . Hence they swing the State some time
to the Republican and some time to the Demo
cratic column.
to the tremendous effort to break the hold
which . Democracy had upon ; our common
wealth, and which it had strengthened for ten
successive years, we selected as our standard-'
bearer the gentlemau whom I present oh be
half of our State here to-day, and who carried
York and took the Legislature with him,
by 156,000 majority.
We are building a navy, and the White
Squadron is a forerunner of a commerce which
is to whiten every sea and carry our flag into
every port of the world. Notour wish, perhaps,
nor., our ambitions probably, but our very
progress and expansion have - made us one of
the family of nations. We can no longer, with
out the hazard ; of unnecessary frictions with
other Governments, conduct our foreign policy,
except, through* the medium of ; a skilled
diplomacy. '

MERCHANT MARINE.
We favor restoring the early American policy of discriminating duties for the up
building of our merchant marine Â«nd the protection of our shipping in the foreign
carrying trade, so that American shipsâ the, product of American labor, employed in
American shipyards, sailing under the Stars and Stripes, and manned, officered and
owned by Americansâ may regain the carrying of our foreign commerce.
r THE FINANCIAL. ISSUE.
THE FINANCIAL ISSUE.
The Republican party is unreservedly for Bound money. It caused the enactment
of the law providing for the resumption of specie payments in 1879; since then every
dollar has been as good as gold. , '
We are unalterably opposed to every measure calculated to debase our currency
or impair the credit of our country. We are, therefore, opposed to the free coinage of '-
silver, except by international agreement with the leading commercial nations of the
world, which we pledge ourselves to ' promote, and until such agreement can be ob
tained the existing gold standard must be preserved. All our silver and paper currency-
.must be maintained at parity with gold, and we favor all measures designed to main-
tain inviolably the obligations of the -United States and all our money, whether coin
or paper, at the present standard, the standard of the most enlightened nations of the ,
-earth.' 'Y. . '; ' ' _ . i:r-'\Y .
;Vi PENSIONS FOR VETERANS.
! The veterans of the Union armies deserve and should receive fair treatment and
generous recognition. Whenever practicable they should be given the preference in
the matter of employment, and they are entitled to this enactment of such laws as are
best calculated to secure the fulfillment of the pledges made to them in the dark -days y
of the country's peril. We denounce the practice of the Pension Bureau so recklessly
and unjustly carried on by the present administration, of reducing pensions and arbi
trarily dropping names from the rolls, as deserving the severest condemnation of the
American people. '.":-_.":â¢*, ''â > 'iV; v'
FOREIGN RELATIONS. 1 , â
Onr foreign policy should be at all times firm, vigorous and dignified, and all our
interests in the western hemisphere carefully watched and guarded. The Hawaiian
Islands should be controlled by the United States and no foreign power should be per-
mitted to interfere with them. The Nicaragua Canal should be built, owned and ope-;
; rated by the United States, and by the purchase of the Danish Islands we should se-
cure a proper and much-needed naval station in the West Indies.
ARMENIAN MASSACRES.
The massacres in Armenia have aroused the deep sympathy and just indignation
of the American people, and we believe that the United States should exercise all the
influence it can properly exert to bring these atrocities to an end. In Turkey, Ameri
can residents have been exposed to the gravest dangers and American property de-
stroyed. There and everywhere American citizens and American property must be
absolutely protected at all hazards and at any cost.

MONROE DOCTRINE. ,"". - /
We reassert the Monroe doctrine in its full extent and we reaffirm tbe right of the
United States to give the doctrine effect by responding to the appeals of any American
State for friendly intervention in case of European encroachment. We have not in
terfered, and shall not interfere, with the existing possessions of any European power
in this hemisphere, but those possessions must riot, on any pretext, be extended. We
hopefully look forward to the eventual withdrawal of the ' European powers from this .
hemisphere and the ultimate union of all the English-speaking part of the continent
by the free consent of its inhabitants.

From the honr of achieving their own independence the people of the United

go out for the full success of their determined contest for liberty.

again that same expectation in the nomina
tion of our candidates.
.What is that' expectation? What is it that
the people want? They want as their candi
date ; something more than a good business
man [alluding to Mr. De pew's characterisation
of Governor .Morton]., .They want something
more than a, good Republican. They -want
something more than a popular leader. , They
want something more \ than a ? wise J political

in himself not only these essential: qualifica
tions, but those in addition which in the high-
est possible degree typify, in name, in charac
ter, in record, in ambition, in purpose, the ex
act opposite of all that is signified and repre

! issuing", â¢ labor-assassinating . ' Democratic ad-
ministration. ' [Cheers]
i - 1 stand here to present to this convention
such a man. . Hi's name is William McKinley.
At this -.point pandemonium was let
loose and the convention gave up to unre-
strained -y yelling, cheering, , hornblowing,
whistling, < catcalling and. all the other
devices common Jto such occasions. A
number of red, white and , blue , plumes
which, carefully wrapped r up,- had been
brought into the convention earlier in the
proceedings, were uncovered and waved,
while almost every; delegate seemed to be
wildly) gesticulating with either a fan or a
flag in the air. â¢: i The \ band tried . in vain ; to
compete with tbe ear-splitting clamor, but
at last the strains of "Marching Through
Georgia*, caught the ears of the crowd and
it joined) in the -chorus and gradually
quieted down. â¢.-;';â¢, . â . .
Then a portrait of McKinley was hoisted
on a line with * the United \ States flag ; on
the ' gallery facing 3 the V platform and the
cheering began over again, to which the
band responded by playing "Rally Round
the Flag,'.-/ the convention joining in 'the
chorus.
. After at least twelve '; minutes . of this
kind of proceeding the chair began to rap
for : a restoration jof order, but without
avail. Governor Foraker ' stood through'
all this wild scene smiling his approval.
Mr. Hepburn of lowa had in the mean-

-time been called to the chair by Senator
Thurston, but just when he had nearly re
stored order Mrs. H. W. R. Strong of Cal
ifornia, who bad presented the plumes in
honor of Ohio's choice, made her appear
ance on the floor waving one of them and
another uncontrollable burst of temporary
insanity occurred. v-
During the interval of confusion a three
quarter face, life-size ' sculptured bust of
McKinley was presented"! to Foraker. by
the Republican Club ot the University of
Chicago. The portrait was in a mahogany
frame decorated with red, white and blue
ribbons. It was accepted by Governor
Foraker in dumb show.
After twenty-five minutes of incessant
turmoil and interruption Mr. Foraker was
allowed to resume . his speech. He said
that from what had occurred, it was . evi
dent that the convention had heard of the
candidate before. His ; words, y however,
seemed to have lost much of their fire and
fervor, because they came in such close
contact and contrast with the unbounded
exuberance of the convention. For some
time he could not secure a bearing. He
spoke of the great champions of Repub
licanism in the past, eulogizing Mr. Blame
particularly, and continued. :
But, greatest of all (measured by present re
quirements), the leader of the House of Rep
resentatives is the author of the McKinley
bill which gave to labor its richest rewards.
No other name completely meets the require
ments of the occasion, and no other name so
absolutely commands all hearts. All the
shafts of envy and malice and slander and libel
and detraction that have been aimed at him lie
broken and harmless at his feet. The quiver
is empty and he is untouched. That is be
cause the people know him. trust him, believe
in him, love him and will not permit any hu
man power to disparage him unjustly in their
estimation.
They know he is an American of Americans.
They know he is just and able and brave; and
they will elect him for President ot the United
States. [Applause.] They have already shown
thisâ not in this or that State, nor in this or
that section, hut in all the States and in all the
sections from ocean to ocean and from the gulf
to the lakes. ; They expect of you to give them
a chance to vote for him. . It is our duty to do
it ilf we discharge that duty we will give joy
to their hearts, enthusiasm to their souls and
triumphant victory to our cause. [Applause.]
And he, in turn, will give us an administra
tion under which the country will enter on a
new era of prosperity at home and of glory
and honor abroad.
By all these tokens of the present, and all
these promises of the future, in the name of
the forty-six delegates of Ohio, I submit his
claim for your consideration. [Great Applause.]
THURSTON'S SECONDING SPEECH
Senator Thurston of Nebraska was recog
nized by Temporary Chairman Hepburn
and seconded the nomination, of McKin
ley. .He said : ' ... â â '..â ".' 'â¢:.â â 
, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Con
vention: This is the year of the people. 1 They
are 1 conscious of their power they are tena
cious of their rights; they are supreme in this
convention; they are certain of victory now
and in November.
. - They have framed the issue of this cam
paign. What is it? Money? Yes, money 1
Not that which is coined for the mine-owner
at the mint or clipped by the coupon-cutter
from the bond, but that which is created by
American muscle on -the farms and in the fac
tories; y The Western ; mountains : clamor * for
silver and the Eastern '' seashore cries for gold,
but the millions ask for workâ an opportunity
to labor and to live. ' .-..Yls'-'Y'--
j The : prosperity :of â  a nation is in the em
ployment of its people, and, thank God, the
electors Vof ; the United States ; know ; this
great ' economic "= truth ; at ; last. * The j Repub
lican party does . not stand for Nevada or
New York alone, but ' for ' both; ' not '. for one
State, . but for all. Its ! platform is as broad
as the land, as National as the ' flag. Republi
cans are definitely committed to sound.cur
rency, but they believe that; in a government
of the people the welfare of men is paramount
to the interests \ of I money. r Their â  shibboleth
for this campaign is "Frotection." From the
vantage ground 'of: their own : selection they
cannot be stampeded by Wall street panics or
free coinage ': cyclones. ' Reports of interna
tional complications and rumors of 'war, pass
them ? lightly by; ; they know that the ; real
enemy of ~ American ' prosperity is free trade,'
and the best " coast defense yis\ a ". protective
tariff. They do not fear the I warlike prepare
tionsof 'â  Europe, but i they do fear , its -" cheap
manufactures. Their real danger is not : from
34
foreign navies carrying guns, but from foreign
fleets bringing goods.
This is the year of the people. They have
risen in their might. From ocean to ocean,
from lake to gulf, they are united as never be
fore. We know their wishes and are here to
register their will. They must not be cheated
of their choice. They know the man best
qualified and equipped to fight their battles
and win their victories. â¢ His name is in every
heart, on every tongue. His nomination is
certain, his election sure. His candidacy will
sweep the country as a prairie is swept by fire.
This is the year of the people. In their name, by
their authority,! second the nomination of their
great champion, William McKinley. Not as a j
favorite son of any State, out as a favorite son
of the United States. Not as a concession to
Ohio, but as an added honor to the Nation.
When bis country called to arms he
took into his boyish hands a musket and fol-
lowed the flag, bravely baring bis breast to the
hell ot battle that It might float serenely in the
Union sky. For a quarter of a century he has
stood in the fierce light of public place, and
his robes of office are as spotless as the driven
snow. He has cherished no higher ambition
than the honor of bis country and the welfare
of the plain people. Steadfastly, courageously,
victoriously and with tongue of fire he has
pleaded their cause. His labor, ability and
perseverance have enriched the statutes of
the United States with legislation in their
behalf. ,All his contributions to the master
pieces of American oratory are the outpour
ings of a pure heart and a patriotic purpose.
His God-given powers are consecrated to the
advancement and renown of his own country
and to the uplifting and ennobling of bis own
countrymen. He has the courage of his con-
victions and cannot be tempted to woo success
or avert defeat by any sacrifice of principle or
concession to popular clamor.
In the hour of Republican disaster, when
other leaders were excusing and. apologizing,
he stood steadfastly by that grand legislative
act which bore his name, confidently sub
mitting his case to the judgment of events, and
calmly waiting for that triumphant vindica
tion whose laurel this convention is impatient
to place Upon his brow.
Strengthened and seasoned by long Congres
sional service ; broadened by the exercise of
Important executive powers; master of the
great economic questions of the age; eloquent,
single-hearted and sincere, he stands to-day
the most conspicuous and commanding char
acter of this generation; divinely ordained, as
I believe, for a great missionâ lead this
people out from the shadow of adversity into
the sunshine of a new, enduring prosperity.
Omnipotence never sleeps. Every great cri-
sis brings a leader. For every supreme hour
providence finds a man. The necessities of '96
are almost as great as those of '61. True, the
enemies of the Nation have ceased to threaten
with the sword, and the constitution of the
United States no longer tolerates that shackles
shall fret the limbs of men; but free trade and
freo coinage hold no less menace to American
progress than did the armed hosts of treason
and rebellion. If the voice of the people is
indeed the voice of God, then William McKin
ley Is the complement or Abraham Lincoln.
Yea, and he will issue a new emancipation
proclamation to the enslaved sons of toil, and
they shall be lifted up into the full enjoyment
of those privileges, advantages and opportuni-
ties that belong of right to the American peo
ple. i:Y.~*Y
Under his administration we shall command
the respect of the nations of the earth; the
American flag will never be hauled down ; the
rights of American citizenship will be en-
forced; abundant revenues provided; foreign
merchandise will remain abroad, our gold be
kept at home; American institutions will be
cherished and upheld all governmental obli
gations scrupulously kept, and on the escutch
eon of the Republic will be indelibly engraved j
the American policy, "Protection, reciprocity
and sound money."
My countrymen! let not your hearts be
troubled; the darkest hour is just before the
day, the morning of the twentieth century
will dawn bright and clear. Lift up your hope
ful faces and receive the light; the Republican
party is coming back to power and William
McKinley will be President of the United
States.
In an inland manufacturing city, on election
night, November, 1594, after the wires had
confirmed the news of a sweeping Republican
victory two workingmen had started to climb
to the top of a great smokeless chimney.
That chimney had been built by the invita
tion and upon the promise of Republican pro
tective legislation. In the factory over which
it towered was employment for twice a thou-
sand men. Its mighty roar had heralded the
prosperity of a whole community. It had
stood a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by
night for a busy, industrious, happy people.
Now bleak, blackened, voiceless and disman
tled, like a grim specter of evil, it frowned
down upon the hapless city, where poverty,
idleness, stagnation and want attested the
complete disaster of the free-trade experi
ment.
Up, and up and up they climbed, watched
by the breathless multitude below. Up, and
up, and up, until at last they stood upon its
summit; and there, in the glare of the electric
lights, cheered by the gathered thousands,
they unfurled and nailed an American flag.
Down in the streets strong men weptâ the
happy tears of hopeâ and mothers, lifting up
their babes, invoked the blessing of the flag;
and then impassioned li ps burst forth in song
the hallelujah of exultant hosts, the mighty
pean of a people's joy. That song, the enthusi
astic millions sing ii yet: y ,; y
Hurrah! hurrah! we bring the Jubilee;
Hurrah! hurrah! the flag that makes ns free.
80 we sin; the cborus from the mountains to
sea;
Hurrah for McKinley and protection.
Over the city that free flag waved, caressed
by the passing breeze, kissed by tbe silent
stars. And there the first glad sunshine of the
morning fell upon it, luminous and lustrous
with the tidings of Republican success.
On behalf of those stalwart workmen and all
the vast army of American toilers; tbat their
employment may be certain, their wages just,
their dollars the best of the civilized world;
on behalf of that dismantled chimney and the
deserted factory at its base ; that the mighty
furnaces may once more flame, the mighty
wheels revolve, the whistles scream, the an
vils ring, the spindles hum; on behalf of the
thousand cottages roundabout and all the
humble homes of this broad land; that com
fort and contentment may again abide, the
firesides glow, the women sing, the children
laugh; yes, and on behalf of that American
flag and ail it stands for and represents; for
the honor of every stripe, for the glory of every
star; that its power may fill the earth and its
splendor span, the skyâ i ask the nomina
tion of that loyal American, that Christian
gentleman, soldier, statesman, patriot, Wil
liam McKinley. ______
HASTINGS SPEAKS FOR QUAY.
At the close of Mr. Thurston's effective
speech cries of "Vote" were raised, inter
spersed with cries for "Quay." In the
midst of this Governor Hastings took the
stand and placed in nomination the name
of Matthew Stanley Quay. He said :
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: Pennsylvania comes to this convention
giving you the cordial assurance that, whoever
may be the National standard-bearer, he will re
ceive of all tbe States in the Union the largest
majority from the Keystone State. There have
been no faltering footsteps in Pennsylvania
when the tenets of Republicanism have been
at stake. Our party's principles have always
been held as sacred as Independence Hall or
the memory of her dead soldiers. Having
within her borders more American citizens
relatively who own the homes in which they
live; whose principal daily avocation is to sub
due and develop her great storehouses of native
wealth; whose wage-earners, skilled and un
skilled, receive, one year with another, the
highest average American wage-rateâ the Re
publicans of Pennsylvania, by their -chosen
representatives, come to this convention and,
with you, demand, and their every Interest de
mands, a system of National currency equal to
the best in the world.
They demand as well that the Government
they love and for whose flag they have fought
and still stand ready to defend shall pay its
debts In money and not in promises. They in
sist that a dollar is not created by the fiat of
the Government, but must have 1 100 cents of
intrinsic or exchangeable value, measured by
the world's standard, and '. that , any debase
ment of the standard would be fatal to busi
ness security and National honor. They be
lieve In the old-fashioned custom of * living
within their income, and when the Income is
unequal to the necessary outgo ,tbey,; Insist
upon increasing their revenue rather than
increasing their debt. They believe that the
primary object of government is to defend and
promote the interests of the people who have
ordained that Government for the advance
ment of their common welfare. They hold
that the revenue policy and the protective
policy go hand in hand, and they stand as the
sturdy and unwavering champions of that
American system of fair and open-handed pro
tection which, injuring none and helping all,
has made this Nation great and prosperous. .
Pennsylvania comes to this convention and
with great unanimity asks ..you to name a
standard-bearer who will represent hot only
the principles and conditions but the bright
est hopes and aspirations of the Republican
party; a man who has been a loyal supporter
of Its every great movement; a potent factor
in its councils from the day of its birth , and
baptism en Pennsylvania soil to the present
time; a man whose every vote and utterance
has been upon the side of sound money, fair
protection and a strong and patriotic Ameri
canism. Those whom I represent and who ask
his nomination at your hands point to a states
man who has been in the forefront of every
battle for his party; who has been its cham
pion, its wise counselor, its organizer and the
successful leader of its forlorn hopes. He was
with those patriots who rocked the cradle of
Republicanism; be was among the first to com
prehend the magnitude of the armed debate of
'til and tt> give himself to the Union cause.
In 1878 he stemmed the tide of currency infla
tion and won a victory which, while less osten
tatious, was equal in importance to his suc
cessful rescue of the country from free trade
and Grover Cleveland in '88.
The American citizen who believe* that all
laws and all policies should be for America's
best interest; the American soldier who ad
mil es valor as much as he loves the flag of his
reunited country; the American wage-earner
who loves his home and family, and who will
never consent to sink himself to the wage level
of the foreign pauper; the American manu
facturer emerging from the tortures of a free
trade panic, and, anxious to relight the fires of
industry where darkness and silence still hold
sway; they who loudly proclaim their recent
but perfect conversion to the true gospel of
Republicanism; who demand dollars as good as
gold as the wage for good work who believe
in commercial reciprocity with other nations,
but who say "halt" to any further foreign en
croachment upon any part of Americaâ these,
all these, have found in him a steadfast friend
and able supporter. He was the soldiers' friend
in war, and he has been their constant cham
pion in peace. The survivor of those who
fought for freedom and won immortal fame
recognize in him a comrade whose valor has
been proved on bard-fought field and attested
in the Droudest trophy ever won by soldier â
the decoration awarded him by the American
Congress. -, :Y Y:,-::iY,:~
Called to lead a forlorn hope in the great
campaign of '88 he wrought a task equal to
the six labors of Hercules. He organized the
patriotism and Republicanism of the country
for victory. He throttled the Tammany tiger
in his den and/forcing an honest vote and an
honest count in the stronghold of the most
powerful political organization in the land,
rescued the country from the heresies of Dem
ocracy. Having thus made himself too power
ful and too dangerous to the enemy, the order
went forth to assassinate him, but the poisoned
arrows of slander and vituperation, thrown in
bitter and relentless hatred, fell broken at his
feet. He turned to the people among whom
he lived and whose aervant he was, and bis
vindication at their hands was a unanimous
re-election to the Senate of the United States.
There, representing imperial Pennsylvania
and ber interests, he stood like a rock, resist
ing the combined power of a free-trade Presi
dent and party, until the deformity known as
the Wilson bill was altered and amended so as
to save at least some of the business interests
of his State and country from entire and utter
ruin. We welcome the issue American pro
tection, American credit and an Ameri
can policy. Let, the people in the cam
paign which this convention inaugurates de
termine whether they are still willing to live
through another free-trade panic. Let the
wage-earner and wage-payer contemplate j the
bitter experience which brought hunger to the
home of one and financial ruin to the other.
Let the American farmer compare farm
product prices with free-tiade promises. Let
him who has saved a surplus and him who
works for a livelihood determine, each for
himself, if he craves to be paid in Ameri
can dollars, disgraced, and Â£'; depreciated
to half â¢ their alleged . value, y Let him
who fought for his country's flag ;
let the widow, the . orphan y and ; the
loving parent who gave up that which was as
precious as life, behold that flag, and all it
stands for, pawned to a foreign and domestic
joint syndicate to raise temporary Joans for
the purpose of postponing the final financial
disaster and answer whether they want the
shame and humiliation repeated. Let -the
sovereign voice be heard in the coming elec
tion declaring that the only Government
founded on the rock of freedom, blessed . with
every gift of nature and crowned with un
measured possibilities, shall not be dethroned,
degraded, pauperized by a party and a policy
at war with the very genius of our National
existence.
Nominate him who I now name, and this
country will have a President whose mental
endowments, broad-minded' statesmanship,
ripe experience, marvelous sagacity, unassum
ing modesty, knightly courage and true
Americanism are unexcelled. Nominate him
and he will elect himself.
I name to you the soldier and the states
man, Pennsylvania's choiceâ Matthew Stanley
Quay. 'y >:
Governor Hastings was listened to with
attention, and there was quite a formid
able demonstration of applause for Quay
at the close of his speech. It was partici
pated in by only a small portion of the
convention, however, and was maintained
with difficulty, though with much noise
and amid counter demonstrations almost
as numerous. As it was dying away, the
rhythmic cry of "Quay, Quay, M. S.
Quay," accompanied by stamping of feet
set in. The hisses increased in volume,
and delegates began to pelt each other
with rolled-up newspapers. Cries of
"Vote, vote," were started in every section
to beat down the similar shouts of
"Quay."
The chair rapped in vain for some time,
but at last quiet was restored and the call
of States was. resumed, and J. Madison
Vance of Louisiana, a colored delegate
from that State, was recognized to second
McKinley. At the close of his brief re
marks, the chair announced that, the call
of States being completed, the order called
for balloting for the nominee for President
of the United States.
ONE BALLOT DECIDES IT.
Ohio Casts the Vote Making Mc-
Kinley the Nominee.
CONVENTION HALL, ST. LOUIS. Mo.,
June 18.â Amid a hush the call of States
was begun, Alabama starting off with 1 for
Morton and 19 for McKinley. Arkansas
and California: cast their solid voted for
McKinley. ' Connecticut cast 5 votes for
Reed and 7 for McKinley; Delaware a solid
vote for McKinley ; Florida 8 for McKinley ;
Georgia, 2 for Reed, 2 for Quay and 2 for
McKinley. .
One of the colored delegates from Flori
da, amid angry protests, insisted on chal
lenging "the vote, and Senator Thurston,
who had resumed the chair, decided ? that
the right of; challenge should be given to
every delegate. The delegation being
polled it was - found tbat Morton had 2
votes in- Florida and McKinley ' only 6,
instead of .8, as announced by the chair
man of the delegation. A challenge of
Georgia followed, and resulted in confirm
ing the vote as previously announced. %
; ' A colored , delegate from Alabama here
followed with a challenge of ; the vote of
that State, which resulted in i showing
that, instead of casting a solid vote for
McKinley. the vote should have shown 1
vote for Morton, 2 for Reed and McKinley.
19. yy Illinois' vote, announced as 46 for
McKinley and 2 for Reed, was challenged
and a poll resulted showing no change.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUN_ ly, 18516.
AN EPITOME OF REPUBLICANISM.
Being an Extract From the Speech of Senator Thurston Upon Assuming the Duties of
This generation has had its object lesson, and the doom of the Democratic party is already pronounced.
The American people will return the Republican party to power, because they know that its administration
will mean: The supremacy of the constitution of the United States ; the maintenance of law and order ; the
protection of every American citizen in his right to live, to labor and to vote ; a vigorous foreign policy ; the
enforcement of the Monroe doctrine ; the restoration of our merchant marine ; safety under the stars and
stripes on every sea, in every port ; a revenue adequate for all Governmental expenditures and the gradual
extinguishment af the National debt ; a currency "as sound as the Government and as untarnished as" its
honor," whose dollars, whether of gold, silver or paper, shall have equal purchasing and debt-paying power
with the best dolTars of the civilized world; a protective tariff which protects, coupled with a reciprocity
which reciprocates, thereby securing the best markets for American products and opening American factories
to the free coinage of American muscle ; pension policy just and generous to our living heroes and to the
widows and orphans of their dead comrades ; the Governmental supervision and control of transportation
lines and rates ; the protection of the people from all unlawful combinations and unjust exactions of aggre
gated capital and corporate power ; an American welcome to every God-fearing, liberty-loving, constitution
respecting, law-abiding, labor-seeking, decent man; the exclusion of all whose birth, whose blood, whose teach
ings, whose practices would menace the permanency cf free institutions, endanger the safety of American
society or lessen the opportunities of American labor ; the abolition of sectionalism â every star in the Amer
ican flag shining for the honor and welfare and happiness of every commonwealth and of all the people;
a deathless loyalty to all that is truly American and a patriotism eternal as the stars.
Indiana cast its 30 votes for McKinley.
lowa, amid a slight demonstration of ap
plause, cast its 26 votes for Allison and
Kansas went solid for McKinley. Ken
tucky cast 26 for McKinley. Louisiana
cast a curious voteâ vote Reed, }_ vote
Quay, }_ vote blank and }_ for McKinley.
So the voting went on without further in
cident until Massachusetts gave 1 vote for
McKinley and the rest for Reed.
The McKinley column steadily in
creased. When Mississippi'^ 18 votes were
cast for McKinley another of the colored
delegates demanded a poll, which showed
1 vote for Quay and 17 for McKinley.
Montana cast 1 vote for McKinley, 1 for
Don Cameron of Pennsylvania, 1 blank
and 1 absentee. The chair called the
name of Mr. Hartman's alternate and he
voted blank.
There was a decided sensation when the
vote of New York was challenged by War
ner Miller. It had been announced as 54
for Morton and 17 for McKinley. Joseph
B. Newins was absent in the First District
and the name of his alternate was called.
Mr. Gruber raised a laugh by saying:
"He's just leaving the room to avoid vot
ing."
The next alternate was called and voted
for McKinley. The delegation voted solidly
for Morton till the half votes were reached,
when the halves divided equally between
McKinley and Morton.
.' When Ohio was reached the requisite
number of votes were given to nominate
I McKinley, and the convention, recogniz-
ing the fact without announcement, broke
into cheers.
Alaska wound ud the roll by casting its
newly conferred four votes for McKinley.
The absent delegate from New York,
Mr. : Parkhurst, here : appeared and by
unanimous consent cast his vote for Mor-
ton, making the: total vote, Morton 55,
McKinley 17. < -a- :'->â¢
All of the States having been called the
president stated before the announcement
of the result that application had been
made to him for recognition by the repre
sentatives of the defeated candidates ;to
make a certain motion. He believed it
would be the -y fairest way to recognize
tbem in the order in which the names had
been made. He then proceeded to state
the result of the vote.
When he announced that McKinley had
received 661 }â¢_ votes the scene of an hour
ago was repeated. /
Delegates and spectators arose * and
cheered and waved flags and banners and
the pampas plumes of California; the
band struck up, "My Country, 'tis of
Thee," and cheers and huzzas rent the
air.
. There was not a single one of the 15,000
or 16,000 people in the great hull who did
not do his or her best to swell the sounds
of jubilee, and to join in the grand popular
demonstration in favor of the successful
candidate. The women were as' enthusi
astic as the men. II seemed as though no
one would be seated again and orderly
proceedings would never more be at
tempted.
One young man on the platform waved,
on the point of the National banner, a
laced cocked hat, such as the conqueror
of Marengo is represented as wearing.
This symbol of victory added, if possible,
to the enthusiasm, and the. noise was
swelled by the booming of artillery out
side.
At last the chairman got a chance to
continue his announcement of the vote.
Thomas B. Reed, he said, had received
84}_ votes, Senator Quay 61}., Levi P.
Morton 58, Senator Allison 35}_ and Don
Cameron L Following is the : official de
tailed vote for President:
* * Blank, 4.
Necessary to a choice, 454.
Total number delegates present, 900.
- Senator Lodge, rising in his delegation y
and standing upon his chair, said:
y Mr. Chairman; The friends of Mr. Reed have
followed him with the same loyalty which he
Chairman of the St. Louis Convention.
has always shown himself to the country and
to the . principles of his party. That loyalty
they now transfer to the soldier, the patriot,
the American, whom you have named hereto
day, and on behalf of my own State, and I be
lieve of all the other New England States that
supported Mr. Reed, we pledge a great majority
in our States and our assistance in other
States, and all the help we can render for Wil
liam McKinley. [Cheers.] I move you, sir,
that the nomination of William McKinley may
be made unanimous. [Cheers.]
Mr. Hastings of Pennsylvania, who had
nominated Senator Quay, seconded the
motion to make McKinley's nomina
tion unanimous. Pennsylvania! he said,
with the loyalty which - always distin
guished her, would become the champion
of the champion of protection to American
industryâ William McKinleyâ and would
welcome the issue of American protection,
American credit, American policy, and
give to William McKinley the largest ma
jority she had ever given to a Republican
candidate. .. " -'
Thomas 0. Piatt, on behalf of the State
of New York, also seconded the motion to
make William McKiniey's , nomination
unanimous and declared New York would
give its usual (if not double its usual) ma
jority for the Republican candidate.
Henderson of lowa seconded the nomi
nation of McKinley. The convention, he
said, had elected a National Committee to
run the coming campaign, but it was not
needed. The Republicans of the country
would run the next campaign. [Cheers.] It
was they who had made the nomination
and not Mark Hanna or General Grosve
nor. [More cheers.] The _ States, he said,
would give to Mr. McKinley a majority
unprecedented in American history. By
the authority of the distinguished Senator
from lowa, Mr. Allison, and in obedience
to the instructions of the - delegation, he
seconded tbe motion to make McKinley
the unanimous choice of the Republicans
of the United States for President. [Ap
plause.] â¢-â.. '*l 'Â«*
Yielding to vociferous calls for a speech,
Mr. Depew mountea his chair in the back
part of the hall, where the rays of the
evening sun shone on his countenance,
which beamed with Joy and good humor.
He said : v
â¢ I am now in the happy position of making a
speech on the man who is going to be elected,
[Laughter and applause.] It is a great thing
for an amateur, when his first nomination has
failed, to come In and second the man who
has succeeded. New York is here, with no
bitter feeling and no disappointment. [Laugh
ter.] We recognize that the waves have sub
merged us, but we have bobbed up serenely.
It was a cannon from New York that sounded
the first news of McKinley's nomination.
I They said of Governor Morton's father that
he was a New England clergyman who brought
up a family of ten children on $300 a year,
and was,. notwithstanding, gifted in prayer.
[Laughter.] It does not make any difference
how poor he may be, how out of work, how
ragged, how next-d oor-to- a- tramp anybody may
be in the United States to-night, he will be
"gifted in prayer" at the result of this conven
tion. â¢ [Cheers.] ", ,
There is a principle dear to the American
heart. It is the principle which moves Ameri
can spindles, starts its industries and makes
the wage-earners sought for, instead of seek
ing employment. That principle is embodied
in McKinley. His personality explains the
nomination to-day, and his personality will;
carry with him to the Presidential chair the
aspirations of the voters of America, of the
families of America, of the homes of America
protection to American industry and America
for Americans. [Cheers.]
y Cries of . "Quay" and "Mark Hanna'
were raised. Mr. Hanna, from ; the body
of the hall responded in a few words which
were almost inaudible in the confusion,
pledging himself to take his place in the
ranks and work for the election of Mc-
Kinley. . -
y The chair put the question : "Shall the
nomination be made unanimous?" and by
a rising vote it was so ordered. The chair
announced that William McKinley was
the candidate of the : Republican party for
President of the United States..

BULKELEY'S NAME PRESENTED
. When Connecticut was reached Fessen-;
den took the stand and said :
Two acta have already been performed by
this great convention, which should receive
the i hearty and the enthusiastic approval and
ratification of every loyal - Republican of the
United States. The first is the nomination of
the soldier, patriot and great - statesman of
Ohio.' Governor .: McKinley, \ as : our , choice for
the Presidency. The second is the adoption of
a platform, which in unequivocal terms pledges
the Republican party. of this great nation to
maintain an honest currency and the present
standard. We have also made a declaration in
favor .; of American industry, always 'so ably
championed by the candidate we have chosen.
v Now, the people of the State I represent were
foremost in expressing their belief in an hon
est dollar and a single standard, and that
standard gold. y Connecticut -is vitally inter
ested in this question and though classed as a
doubtfuhState, we believe we shall carry I her
In November for the candidates of the Rep Ã¼b-,
lican party.
Â§T have the honor and pleasure of naming for
the second place on our National ticket a Con
necticut man a man who represents the sen
timents of the Republicans and protection
ists and sound-money men ; a stanch and tried
Republican; a man equally distinguished for
his rare courage, energy, his integrity and
his ability. I nominate Hon. Morgan G. Bulke
ley of Connecticut for Vice-President of the
United States.
Mr. Fessenden sketched Mr. Balkeley's
successful career, and said he was now at
the head of one of the largest business en
terprises of the State, and had been
thrice elected Mayor of the Democratic
city of Hartford, and had given them a
magnificent administration. "
FORT NAMES HOBART.
Judge John Franklin Fort of New Jer
sey placed in nomination Hon. Garrett A.
Hobart. He said: y
I rise to present to this convention the claims
of New Jersey to the Vice-Presidency. We
come because we feel that we can, lor the first
time in our history, bring to you a promise
that our electoral vote will be cast for your
nominees. If you comply with our request
this promise will surely be redeemed.
For forty years, through the blackness of
darkness of a universally triumphant Democ
racy, the Republicans of New Jersey have
maintained their organization, and fought as
valiantly as if the outcome were to be assured
victory. Only twice through all this long
period has the sun shone in upon us. Yet,
throueh all these weary years, we have, like
Goldsmith's "Captive," felt that,
v Hope, like the gleaming taper's light.
Adorns and cheers our way;
And still, as darker grows the night,
Emits a brighter ray.
The fulfillment of this hope came in 1894.
In that year, for the first time since the Re
publican party came into existence, we sent to
Congress a solid delegation of eight Republi
cans, and elected a Republican to the United
Slates Senate. We followed this in 1895 by
electing a Republican Governor by a majority
of 28,000, and in tbis year of grace we expect
to give the Republican electors a majority of
not less than 20,000. â ;.,'â¢ \ .
I come to you to-day then in behalf of the
new New Jersey, a politically redeemed and
regenerated State. Old times have passed
away, and behold! all things have become
new. It is many long years since New Jersey
has secured recognition from the Nation.
When Henry Clay stood for protection in 1844,
New Jersey furnished Theodore Frelinghuy
sen as his associate. The issue then was the
restoration of the tariff, and was more nearly
like that of to-day than at any. other period
which I can recall in the Nation's political
history, yln 1856, when the freedom of man
brought the Republican party into existence
and the great "Pathfinder" was called to lead,
New Jersey furnished for that unequal contest
William L. Dayton as tbe Vice-Presidential can
didate.
Since then, counting for nothing, we have
asked for nothing. During this period Maine
has had a candidate for President and a Vice-
President; Massachusetts . a Vice-President;
New York four Vice-Presidents, one of whom
became President for almost a full term ; Indi
ana a President, a candidate for President and
a Vice-President â¢ Illinois ;a ! President twice
, and a Vice-Presidential candidate; Ohio two
Presidents, and now a candidate for the third
time ; Tennessee a * Vice-President, who be
came President for almost a full term.
We believe that the Vice-Presidency in 1896
should be ' given to New Jersey. We have rea
sons for our opinion. We have ten electoral
votes; we have carried the State in the elec
tions of '93, '94 and '95. We hope and believe
we can keep the State in the Republican col-
umn for all time. By your - action to-day you
can greatly aid us. : :; y Â» â¢
Do you believe you could place the . Vice-
Presidency in a State more justly entitled to
recognition, or one which it would be of more
public advantage to hold ;in the Republican
ranks? ; If the party in any State is deserving
of approval for the sacrifice of its ; members to
maintain its organization, then the Repub
licans of New Jersey, in this the hour of their
ascendancy, after long years of bitter defeat,
feel that they cannot come to this convention
in vain. y
We appeal to our brethren In the South, who
know with us what it is to be overridden by
ft aud in the ballot-box; to be counted out by
corrupt election officers; to be dominated by
an arrogant, unrelenting Democracy.
We would have carried our State at every
election for the past ten years if the count
had been an honest one. We â  succeeded â¢in
throttling the ballot-box stutters and impris
oning the : corrupt election ' officers, ? only '* to
have the whole raft of them pardoned in a
day, to work again their nefarious practices
upon an honest people.
- But to-day, under ballot-reform laws, with an
honest count, we j know we can win. Slt has
been a long, terrible strife to the goal, but we
have reached it unaided and unassisted from
without, and we come to-day, promising to the
ticket here selected ' the vote of New Jersey,
whether you can give us the Vice-Presidential
candidate \or not. We make it \no test of
our : Republicanism that we have a candidate.
We have been too long used to fighting for
principle for that; but we do say that you can,
by granting our right, lighten our burden and
make us ; a confident party, with , victory in
sight, even before the contest begins. - .
â | Will we carry Colorado,' Montana and Nevada
this year, if the Democracy delare for sliver at
16 to 1? | Let us hope we may. y New Jersey hat
as many, electoral votes as those three States
together. Will you not make New Jersey sure
to take their place in case of need?
'i We have in all ' these long years of Republi
canism been the "Lone Star" Democratic State
in the North. Our forty ! years of wandering
in the wilderness ;of i Democracy are ended ;
our Egyptian darkness 'disappears. : We are on
the . hilltop, :' looking , into the promised land.
Encourage us as we march over into the politi
cal Caanan of Republicanism, there to remain,
by giving us a leader on the National ticket to
go up with us. ,' .
yWe are proud of our public men. Their Re
publicanism and love of > country I has been
welded in 'â  the , furnace of political adversity.
That man is a Republican who adheres to the
party in a State where there is no hope for the
gratification of personal ambitions. There are
no , camp-followers in I the ; minority } party, in
any . State. : They are all true soldiers in the
militant army doing valiant service, without
reward, gain or hope ; thereof I from . people ,

. A true representative of this class of Repub-
Means in New Jersey we offer you to-day. He
is in the prime of life, a never-faltering friend,
with qualities of leadership unsurpassed, of
sterling honor, of broad mind, of liberal views,
of wide public information, of great business
capacity, and, withal, a parliament-Man who
would grace the Presidency of ; the Senate of
the United States. A native of our State, the
son of an humble farmer, he was reared to
love of country in sight of the historic field of
Monmouth, on which the blood of our ances
tors was shed that the Republic might exist.
From a poor boy, unaided and â¢ alone, he has
risen to high renown among us. . . 1-
In our State we have done for him all that
the present conditions would permit. â¢ He has
been Speaker of our Assembly and President of
our Senate. He has been the choice for United
States Senator of the â  Republican minority in
the Legislature, and had it been in our power
to have placed him in the Senate of the United
States he would long ere this have been there.
His capabilities are such as would grace any
position of honor in the Nation. Not lor him
self, but for our State; not for his ambition,
but to give to the Nation the highest type of
public official, do we come to this convention
by the command of our State and in the name
of the Republican party of New Jerseyâuncon
quered and unconquerable, undivided and in
divisibleâwith one united voice speaking for
all that counts for good citizenship in our
State, and nominate to you for the office of
Vice-President ot this Republic Garret A. Ho
bart of New Jersey.
Mr. Humphrey of Illinois briefly sec
onded the nomination of Mr. Hobart in
the name of Illinois.
RHODE ISLAND'S CHOICE.
The rollcall of States was resumed and
New York made no nomination. When
Rhode Island Was called Mr. Allen of that
State came to the stand and nominated
for . the Vice-Presidency Charles Warren
Lippitt. He said that that little State had
given a hero to the revolution in 1776, a
Burnside to the Union in 1861, and that it
now had in Congress the father of the Mc-
Kinley protection act, meaning Senator
Aldrich.
RANDOLPH NOMINATES EVANS.
When the State of Tennessee was called
Mr. Randolph, a delegate from that State,
nominated for the Vice-Presidency H.
Clay Evans of Tennessee. He said :
Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: It has been more than thirty years since
any citizen of the States organized as the Con-
federate States was presented by either
of the great National parties for the
office of President or Vice-President.
When the great armed conflict for
the Nation's life was entered upon, the Repub
lican party had just assumed control of the
Government. It became the champion of the
union of the States and the preservation of the
Government under the constitution. At tbe
close of the contest the success of the National
i armies was regarded as the special triumph of
the Republican party. The people of the States
of the South bad been in revolt, and it was but
natural that tor a time after active hostilities
had ceased the Republican party and those
people should distrust each other. The one
found the great majority of its voters in the
States which had adhered to the Union, and
tnerefore selected its candidates tor President
1 and Vice-President from those States.
The Democratic party had been the domi
nant party in the States of the South for many
generations, and the people regarded that
party not only as their traditional represent-
ative, but as the peculiar exponent of their
political views. A solid South in the Demo-'
cratic column of electoral votes was the neces
sary consequence, and for many years the Re-
publican party has â  entered upon every
National contest handicapped with 159
electoral votes absolutely certain against its
nominees. To overcome this immense vote
thus fixed against it required the carrying of
each of certain doubtful States of the North,
and the failure to carry .any one of those
States, as was demonstrated in the defeat of
Mr. Blame in the contest of 1884, meant the
election of the Democratic nominees.
To change this condition of affairs requires a
change of the relations between the people of
the Southern States and the Republican party.
To accomplish such a change two things must
concurâ the people of the South or a majority
of them must be satisfied that their interests
are to be promoted by the success of the Re-
publican party, and that the Republican party
ls ready and willing to concede to them, when
members of it, and acting with it, equal recog
nition with the people of the other States in
the selection of officers and agents for the ad-
ministration of government, and that change
must be brought about by obtaining converts
from the Democratic party.
The experience of the last four years in the
administration of the National Government
upon Democratic principles and through Dem
ocratic officers and agents has furnished satis-
factory proof on the first proposition, and a
large majority of the intelligent people of the
former solid South is now ready to admit that
the principles announced in the platform just
adopted, when honestly administered through
capable officers and agents, must result in the
building up of a new South', not only In name
but in industrial development and in all that
goes to make up a happy and prosperous
people. , ,
The proof of the other proposition, that the
people of the Southern States, who are Repub
licans and who are , honest, worthy and capa
ble, are to be trusted as officers at>d agents in
the administration of the Government under
like circumstances equally with their brother.
of other States, ana that no invidious discrimi
j nation is to be made against them , because of
their locality or ancestry or past history or
: affiliations, remains yet to be made. y
Now . is the time for the great Republican
party to make its first serious effort to build
, itself up and put itself in a position of impieg-
nable strength among tbe people of the South.
The Southern States are now Its recruiting
ground. The : solid South is reliably ' n did
for the Democratic party no longer. Kentucky,
Tennessee, â¢ Maryland, Delaware, Virginia,
Missouri and North Carolina have given un-
mistakable indications of drifting away, and
with proper encouragement and suitable
recognition they may safely be placed in the
Republican column, not only when the result
of the election in November is announced, but
in future contests as they periodically occur.
- Tennessee, the gateway of the South proper,
the great battlefield of the Civil War, the State
which voted by a large majority against seces
sion when the question was submitted to its
people, the last State to join itself to the Con-.
federate States and ; the first ; State to return
! its loyalty to the Union, now presents you one
of its most distinguished citizens for the second
place on your ticket.
; It is true he .is not a native born, but he is
moreâ he is a citizen by choice and he comes
from a portion of the State where people have
always been | loyal to ( the Union and the con-
stitution and who furnished more soldiers for
the armies of the Union In proportion to their
population than any other Territory in the
United States.
Our nominee was born in the great State of
Pennsylvania. He was reared in the equally
great State of Wisconsin. When the President
in the beginning of the Nation's danger called
the citizens to arms to preserve the Union and
perpetuate the ; constitution, though a mere
boy, he enlisted as a private , soldier ahd after
going through all the perils of .: the war at the
end he was honorably discharged from service.
He then became a citizen of * the State of Ten
nessee, and has devoted his industry, energy
and ability in developing the resources of the
State. He has won the friendship, confidence
and respect of the people y among whom he
lives. They have put him in various official
positions. He has been Mayor of his city; a
member of Congress from bis district, and First
Assistant' Postmaster-General in the last Re
publican administration.
â¢ In every position he ;; has discharged his
duties honestly and faithfully and to the satis
faction of the ; people. After he had thus
established himself the Republicans of Ten
nessee nominated him: for Governor, and the
people at the November election of 1893 gave
him a majority of 748 votes over his opponent
as shown by the face of the i returns made by
the officers holding the election. ',: â â > â¦
- After the election a Democratic Legislature
enacted a law for the purpose of contesting it.
it is not too much to say v that the law was
designed to deprive him of the office to which
the people had elected him; and the same men
who as a Legislature had passed the law, as
sumed, unler the law, as jutlges, to pass upon
his right to the office. *
A pretended judicial inquiry was institutedâ
as a matter of fact, it was neither judicial nor
fair The issues made were false and the tea
timony garbled. The decision changed the
face of tite returns. Enough votes were taken
from what he ' had received to give his op.
ponents a majority, and to change his election
into defeat. The grounds for the rejection of
the votes were not that they had not been cast,
nor that the voters were not legal voterÂ«, nor
that the judges of elections had not been fully
satisfied of tneir right to vote before receiving
their votes. All these facts were admitted, but
the decision was put on the ground that,
though the voters had paid their poll-tax and
had receipts showing the fact for the time
required by the law, such receipts had not
been produced before the officers holding the
election, and those officers, for that reason,
had no right to receive their votes.
In this way thousands of citizens were robbed
of their votes, and a man never elected Gov.
ernor is now holding the office in Tennessee,
The people of Tennessee feel that a great
wrong has been done them, and they want an
opportunity of expressing their public con
damnation of the act. They want an oppor
tunity of showing the confidence they have in
the citizen who has thus been defrauded of
the office to which they elected him. They
believe he is worthy ot any office within the
gift ot the American people.
Representing them here, I name for Vice-
President of the United States Henry Clay
Evans.
The nomination of Mr. Evans was sec
onded by Mr. Smith of Kentucky (a
colored delegate), who declared that the
Republican party was "the grandest or
ganization this side of eternity." [Laugh
ter and cheers.] No Republican conven
tion for the past thirty years had failed to
declare for the sanctity of the ballot, but
it was necessary to do something more
than words. The convention had an
opportunity to do for Southern Repub
licans that which it had done for North
ern industry, by giving to them a candi
date for the Vice-Presidency who should
be to them renewed courage and' hope.
Elect Evans to the Vice- Presidency, ho
said, and there would be a new fence of
Republican States in the South.
FOR WALKER OF VIRGINIA.
v Mr. I. C. Walker (colored) of Virginia
put in nomination his fellow-delegate,
James A. Walker. He told the conven
tion that the financial plank in the plat
form was "strong medicine for the South
ern State?, but they proposed to take it
like little men."
A delegate from West Virginia reported
that that State was solid for sound money,
solid for McKinley und solid for Hobart
of New Jersey for Vice-President,
The balloting for Vice-President then
began.

OVERWHELMED BY A GOLDEN
TORRENT.
The Convention Gives the Yellow Metal a
Heavy Majority Teller's Pathetic
Words Before the
Parting.
The Call's Headquarters,!
Southern Hotel, >
St. Louis, Mo., June 18.)
The first thing on the programme this
morning was the report of the committee
on resolutions, which was read by Joseph
B. Foraker of Ohio. Then followed one of
the most dramatic scenes ever witnessed
in a political convention. Chairman
Thurston announced that he would recog
nize Henry M.Teller, a member of the
resolutions committee, who desired to make
a minority report. The convention was
expecting this, and delegates and spec
tators were still.
Every man in the - convention waited
expectantly to see what the next few.
minutes would bring forth. Would there
be a bolt of the free silver delegates? Was
the great Republican party threatened
with division that would imperil its future?
Then stepped forth Henry M. Teller of
Colorado, United States Senator from that
Stale, delegate to the convention and mem
ber of the resolutions committee, promi
nently mentioned as a joint Presidential
candidate of the free coinage Republicans,
Democrats and Populists. Those who had
never seen the Colorado statesman craned
their necks to get a glimpse of him. Small
in stature, almost insignificant in physique,
dressed in a long, somber black coat, his
forehead y receding, his hair , brushed
straight back from it, grizzly , gray and
black whiskers and beard on his cheeks
and chin, he looked for all the world like
a minister of the gospel, and he talked
like one. In fact, Mr. Teller's appearance
and manner of speaking resembles that of
a Methodist preacher. s' ' \~
He is emotional to a degree; his voice
trembles sometimes tearfully; and he im
presses everybody as an earnest, sincere
man. Though his conclusions may be er
roneous, yet he impresses his auditors as
a man of sincere convictions, and his man
ner of expressing is eloquent and always
effective.
When Senator Teller stepped to the front
of the platform he . was greeted with a
hearty and spontaneous shout from the
little band of free silverites, and as he
warmed up to his work, his voice trem
bling, his body fairly quivering with emo
tion, he forcibly reminded one of a pastor
pleading with his erring flock.
The St. Louis evening papers speak of
Mr. Teller's address to-day as one of the
grandest bursts of oratory ever heard at a
convention. At the conclusion of his ad
dress the Colorado Senator folded his
arms across his breast and took his seat on
the platform, and a perfect storm of ap
plause went up. The free-silver men ap
plauded the sentiments of their cham
pion, while others, who disagreed with his
financial policy, were so impressed with
the eloquent plea of this sincere man that
they could not help joining in the demon
stration.
Then followed the vote to lay the minor
ity report from the resolutions- committee
on the table, which motion prevailed
ayes, 818%; noes, 105>_. The victorious
gold-men made the convention ring with
tbeir cheers. .
Here followed the most dramatic and
thrilling scene ever witnessed in a Na
tional political gathering. Senator Frank
Cannon of Utah, son of George Q. Cannon,
the famous Mormon statesman, began his
valedictory address. The little band of
free-silver voters had slated Frank Cannon
for this duty. He read his speech, and
though his delivery was far from being a
histrionic success his declarations . were
listened to with the most intense interest;
The free 'â¢â¢ silverites cheered him, but the
gold men, who regarded many of his
utterances as unnecessarily severe and ob
noxious, bissea the speaker.
There were shouts of "Get out," "Let
him go" and "Good riddance to bad rub
bish." Chairman Thurston pounded his I
gavel vigorously and appealed to- the
crowd to give the speaker respectful at
tention. He said 'â  it was not an occasion
for criticism or display of temper, but
should be regarded as a sorrowful episode
in the history of the great Republican
party. .'.' â¢ â 'â¢ -'-,-' â¢"''.>-
Tbe crowd was then stilled and Mr. Can
non proceeded with his speech. At its

"All aboard for Chicago! " shouted some
one. "Take the first train ; glad to get rid
of you 1" cried another.
By this time the interest was intense.
Men and women had climbed upon chairs
to get a look at the little band of seceders
from the Republican party. Teller and
Cannon stepped down from the platform ;
and the - convention ; rang with cheers,
hoots, hisses, catcalls and all sorts o
noisy demonstration.
"Good-by, my lover; good-by," sang out
an irreverent and rustic spectator in the
gallery, and this sally was greeted with a
roar of laughter, followed by cheers, howls
and hisses. Here the band struck up a
tune as if it were a farewell to the seces
sionists. The band played "Three Cheers
for the Red, White and Blue," and 10,000
voices joined in the chorus as the little
band of silver rebels walked down from
the platform. Cannon frantically shook
hands with Chairman Thurston. He
wrung his hand as if to say "Well, so long,
old man; good-by to the' Republican
party."
Teller also bade the chairman good-by
as he grasped him by the band and the
pair stepped into the aisle. They were
joined here and there as they moved along
by other bolters, and the procession made
its way out of the south door of the con
vention hall, amid cheers, howls, hisses,
songs and band music. Men and women
were standing on chairs, shouting "good
by, good-by."
Those who walked out were: The entire
Colorado delegation, three from Utah,-' all
of Idaho, Pettigrew of South Dakota,
Hartman of Montana and Cleveland and
Strother of Nevada. Â
When . order was restored several dele
gates were recognized, who arose to ques
tions of privilege. Brown of Utah, Man
tel of Montana and other free-silver men
explained that while they did not approve
of the financial plank of the platform,
they would remain true to the Republican
party. 0. C. Cableton. â 
WALK FROM THE HALL.

CONVENTION HALL, ST. LOUIS, Mo.,
June 18.â At 10:30 o'clock all the delegates
were in the hall, most of them in seats as-
signed to their respective States, but many,
still surged up and down the narrow
aisles, chatting pleasantly with each other
or consulting about possible combina
tions. The galleries were closely packed,
the fair sex being well represented. While
all were waiting for the President to an-
nounce the opening the time passed pleas
antly enoueh in listening to tbe strains of
the band stationed above and behind the
platform, the pleasure being somewhat
dashed by a ditty in praise of protection,
sung by a quartet of male voices. -
At 10:35 the president, Senator Thurs
ton, announced, that the divine blessing
would be invoked: by Rev. John R. Scott
of Florida. Mr. Scott, a short, stout, very
dark negro, delivered a short and feeling
prayer, beginning: V.-3 ,.,- j
'Father of all, from whose hands the cen
turies fall like grains of sand, we meet to-'
day, united, free, loyal." ; â ['
He asked a blessing on the convention
and its work and closed with the recital of
the Lord' Prayer. . i
The chairman said the first order of busi-
ness was the reception of the report of the
committee on resolutions, and the chair
recognized for the purpose Senator-elect
Foraker of Ohio. Mr. Foraker as he
stepped upon the platform was received
with hearty applause. Mr. Foraker read
the platform in a clear voice with distinct
enunciation. He gave a pointed emphasis
to the indorsement of President Harrison,
which was received with cheers, but not
with any overwhelming demonstration.
As Mr. Foraker approached the financial
plank, Mr. Teller left his seat with the
Colorado delegation and moved up to the
platform, where he seated himself at the
end of the second row of seats to the right
of the chairman. With the opening sen
tence, "The Republican party is unre
servedly for sound money," which Mr.
Foraker read slowly and very emphati
cally, a burst of cheering occurred, and the
applause was repeated with redoubled
volume when the pledge to promote an
international agreement for free coinage
was read. The cheering ;at this point was
so prolonged that it interrupted the pro
ceedings for some time and compelled the
chairman to rap for older.
The demand for American control of the
Hawaiian Islands received approval, but
the proposed building of the Nicaragua
canal by the United States and the pur-
chase of the â¢ Danish Islands for a naval
station fell flat. There was surprisingly
little enthusiasm over the- Monroe plank,
but the Cuban paragraph was greeted with
loud cheers, though the convention missed
the phrase demanding the intervention oi
tbe armed forces of. the United _ States in
Cuba, which had appeared in unauthor
ized guesses at the platform. "Influence
and good offices" appeared in place of
"armed intervention."
;â¢' Civil service enforcement was received in
blank silence, but - the demand ' for a 'free
ballot and the condemnation of lynching
elicited the enthusiastic approval' of { the
colored delegates.
"The reading of the platform as a whole
was listened to with marked attention and .
at the close it was freely cheered. The
reading occupied twenty minutes. ForakeT
moved the adoption of the report as the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, â ":] FRIDAY, JUNE 19, 1896.
Republican National platform for 1896.
Then the chair, amid the breathless atten
tion of the convention, recognized Senator
Teller, who sent to the secretary's desk
and had read the following minority re
port:
We, the undersigned members of the com
mittee on resolutions, being unable to agree
with that portion of -.. the majority report
which treats of the subjects of coinage and
finance, respectfully submit the following
paragraph as a substitute therefor:
The Republican party favors the use of both gold
and silver as equal standard money, and pledges its
power to secure the free,' unrestricted and mdc-
pendent coinage of gold and silver at our mints at
the ratio of sixteen parts of silver to one of gold.
Mr. Teller then advanced to the front
and in earnest tones addressed the con
vention in explanation of his course:
Gentlemen of the Convention: I will not
attempt to inflict upon you a discussion of the
great financial question which is dividing the
people, not only in ' this" country \ but in the
whole world. The few moments allotted me
by the convention will not ; permi t me to more
than state briefly our objections to the finan
cial plank proposed for your considers
I am a practical man, and recognize .the con
ditions in this country, foreshadowed, as they
are, by the action of ; the committee. This
plank was presented to the whole committee
and by it rejected. Loyalty, my opinion, and
consideration for the great interest which is
felt in this subject compel me, in the face of
unusual difficulties, to present this for your
consideration, not with that bounding hope or
with that courage that I have presented this
in other bodies with a greater measure of suc
cess than I can hope for here.
The local and supreme importance of this
question is my excuse now for the few words I
shall have to say to you In connection with
the subject. In my public capacity I have
dealt with it for twenty years. I represent a
State that produces silver, but I want to say to
you here and now that my advocacy of . this
proposition is not in the slightest degree in
; fluenced or controlled by that fact [Applause
i and cries of "goon."] I contend for it because
[ I believe there can be no sound financial sys
tem in any country, nor in the world, that
Some Interesting Character Sketches Made in the Lobby of the Southern Hotel, St. Louis.

does not recognize this principle. I contended
for it in 1873, when it was ruthlessly stricken
from our statutes, and since which time there
has been continued ; depreciation : on all the
products of human labor and human energy.
I contend < for it because in this year
1896 the American ' people are In greater
distress than they ever were in v their
history. -I contend for it because
this is, in my judgment, the great incubus
that has struck down enterprise and destroyed
progress in this ' favored land of ours. I con
tend for it because : I believe the progress of
my country is dependent on It. I contend for
it because I believe the civilization of the
world is to be determined by the 'rightful or
wrongful solution of this financial question.
I am tolerant to; those who differ with me. . I
act from my judgment, enlightened as best I
have been able to be by my study and my years
of thought. - 'Â» v^^^^SSWBBBB
,: In my judgment . the American â  people, In
the whole line of their history, have never
been called upon to settle a question of great
importance like this. The great contest" in
which this Nation once participated was not
more important to the people than the ques
tion of finance.
I have said enough. This is not a question
of policy, but a question of principle. It is not
a mere nothing, but a matter on which hangs
the happiness, ; the prosperity,* morality and
Independence of American I labor and Ameri-
can producers. [Applause.] Confronted j for
the first time in history this party of ] oursâ
confronted, I i say, for the first ; timeâ with the
danger of a financial system that, in my judg
ment, would destroy all the great interests of
this land, we are ', called upon to give this pro
vision of our platform our adherence. ' .
-. 3 Mr. President, I do not desire to say unkind
things/arid I touch only for a moment upon
why I object to this provision of this platform.
The . Republican party," has ' never < been " the
party of the single standard. [Applause.] It
was a bimetallic party In its origin and in all
its history. y \ .-'-.'â¢ v '.â .-'..". Y:Yj.:.:
. In 1888 it declared for ] bimetallism, in 1892
it declared ; for. bimetallism. ;v In 1896 ! it ' de
clared for the single gold standard. In 1888
we carried the 1 State ; that I here represent for
the Republican ; nominee; we carried ft on; a
bimetallic- platform ;l we carried it with a ma
jority that was equal, considering our vote, to
that iof any State ;in the V Union. [Faint"; ap
plause] It has been a Republican State from
the hour of its admission. It has -kept in the
' straight road. .V ; y v V'-.-
V Mr. President, I promised you I would not
discuss the silver question, and I will not, ex-
cept to say that this platform is such a distinct

departure from everything heretofore held by
the party that it challenges our j Republican-
ism to accept it. The platform contains some
platitude about ;an international conference.
It provides that we will ; maintain the gold
standard in this country until the principal
nations of | the world shall agree | that we may
do otherwise." This is the first great gathering
of ' Republicans since this party was organized
that has declared the Inability of the Ameri-
can people to control their own affairs.
All the silver delegates rose in a body at
this point and howled their approval of
the speaker's sentiments.
Do you believe the American people are too
weak to actually maintain a financial system
commensurate with the greatness of the coun
try of their own fruition?
Gentlemen of the convention, you would have
a bimetallic agreement with all the great com-
mercial nations of the world, and it cannot be
obtained. So- this' is a declaration that \ the
gold standard is to be put upon this country
and kept there for all time.
. Do you believe Great Britain, that great com
mercial nation of the world, our powerful com-
petitor in commerce and trade, will ever agree
.to open her mints to the free coinage of silver,
or consent that we shall open ours as long as
she has the advantaee of lower prices and de-
clining values that have brought this country,
by the adoption of the gold standard in 1873,
to partial demonetization?
We are the great debtor Nation of the world.
i Great Britain is a creditor. . We pay her every
i year millions and hundreds of millions of dol-
I lars as an income on her investments in this
country and on her loans. The gold standard,
in my judgment, lowers prices and decreases
values. ' And she buys of us millions and mil
lions more than she sells. She buys upon the
gold standard at a lower and depreciating
standard. How long do you think lt would be
before she will agree to assist in raising values
in this country ? It is a solemn declaration
that the Republican party intends to maintain
lower prices and stagnant business for all time
to come. [Cheers from the silver States.] ,
. There is a beneficial provision in this plat-
form about the tariff. I subscribe to that.
[Applause and cheers from all over the house.]
I believe in a protective tariff. [Applause.] â¢' I
have been identified with that for forty years.
i [Applause,] But it is my solemn conviction
that.a protective tariff cannot be maintained
upon a gold standard. [Applause and , cheers
from the silver people.] The tariff protection
principle is for raising the price of human
toil. It is for giving to the producer ample
compensation for his labors. The gold stand.'
ard, on the contrary, everywhere; that it is
enforced, is for the purpose of reducing values.
Now, gentlemen of the convention, I am led
to make this simple objection as to the pro-
tective systemâ lt is in danger, and I will
call your attention to one other fact and then
leave to your judgment whether this platform
shall be adopted or rejected, j Under existing
conditions we undoubtedly have the , gold
standard. I do not; deny that. What I have
sought for is to change it ; for a bimetallic sys
tem. 1 I believed and do believe that when the
Almighty created these two metals he intended
the world should use them for uses for which
they were created. [Applause.] And when he
blessed this land of ours ' with more gold and
more ' silver / than any ; other country m : the
world he meant that we should use them for
the .purposes for which they were intended, to
wit:! to use by they people as stand
ard money. And to-day you - would y re
verse the traditions :of our " country : and
declare we will use only 'one. If the
American people are in favor of that I have
nothing to say. I must submit to the majority
voice in this country of ours. Ido not believe
this party of ours, if lit could be polled, is in
favor of ' the gold 'standard. I believe 90 per
cent of the people are in favor of bimetallism
of the old-fashioned kind that existed In this
country up to 1873. ; y . â¢ y
Mr. President and gentlemen of the conven
tion, I promised you that I would take but a
few moments. '5 But I want. to say a few things
that may seem to yon to;be personal and ought
not to be introduced in an audience like this.
I must beg your indulgence if I seem to tran
scend the proscribed limits on this occasion;
if I shall say something personal to myself. 1
have formed my conviction on 'this question
alter twenty years of study, twenty years of
careful thought and careful reading. I have
been trained in a school that,* it seems, fits me
well for reaching a just conclusion, and I have
formed my conclusions to such ; an extent that
they have : had the I effect j of influencing my
conscience. . '.'.'-."'' y "~- y
" I believe the adoption of the gold standard
by tne United States will work a * great ' hard
ship; that it will increase distress, and that no
legislation touching ; upon ' the tariff ; can re
move the difficulties ' that joowy pervade this
land. I believe, the whole welfare of my race
is wrapped up in a rightful | conclusion on this
question; that the , morality, civilization, nay,
even the religion of my country, is at stake in
this contest. I know, and you know,' that men
in distress 'are ; neither patriotic Â« nor brave. !
You and I know that hunger and distress will
destroy patriotism and love of country. .". .
To have love of country, patriotic feeling and
Independence â  you " must v have ;' your citizens
comfortably fed ' and comfortably / clothed.
That is what Meecham y? said in 1856;
that yis "'What made â  mo . a ; Republican
all y y these .',' " years, rY. because I*. â¢ ... believe
the Republican . party was made for
the great . masses ; of i men, ; that 1 its :; legisla
tion was intended to" lift 'up and elevate and
hold up and sustain the fortunes of our people
and ; give ail , equality before \ the law. ', [Ap
plause.] Ido not believe it can be had with
the gold y standard. You. may doubt â '.. my
judgment, but 1 shall not doubt it. y I must act
upon my judgment, and not upon yours. I
must answer to my conscience and not to \my
neighbor's; I must ; do my duty as it .is ; pre
sented to me, and not as it is presented to you.
I say to you now , that, with the conviction
upon me that this gold plank means ultimate
distress and disaster to my followers, I cannot
subscribe to it, and if adopted I must, as an
honest man; sever my connection with the po
litical organization which makes that one of
the main articles of its faith.' [Prolonged ap
plause.]
I repeat here what I said yesterday. I was
not acting upon :my own judgment alone. I
dare not take : this step alone. iMy friends, I
am sustained in my view of the danger that is
coming to us and coming to the world by the
adoption of the gold standard : by the ', intelli
gence of the world. They may say the silver j
question is ; a ; craze. | Let me tell you*, the best j
part of | Europe,l the best of the world, is with
the advocates of bimetallism. All the great
political speakers of \ Europe, with the excep
tion of five or six, are pronounced advocates
of bimetallism â unrestricted, . unrestrained
bimetallism. All 'of the great teachers ; of
political economy in European colleges, with
out exception, are in favor of bimetallism. My
own judgment, based, as I have said to you,
upon careful preparation and careful study for
twenty years, bears me" out and puts 'â  me on
record with them, and I would be recreant to
the trust given me by my people if I failed to
protest here and ' failed when the Republican
party makes this one ; of .' the tenets of its faith
to sever ymy connection . with that party.
[Cheers and cries of "'No."] ' '
Mr. President, I ask your kind permission
to say a few things, and when I have said
them, having told you what my conscience de
mands that I shall do, I will leave this ques
tion for your consideration. - ".'â 
Do you suppose myself and my associates
who act with . me and take the same view of
this question | that I do do you suppose that
we can take this step without distress? Do
you suppose we could take it for any personal
advantage or any honor that could be con
ferred upon us? We say it is a question of
duty. You may nominate In this convention
any man you choose. If you will put him on
the right kind of platform, l will y toil for
him. You may take any methods to nominate
him that you think proper. I will abide by
your judgment and support him if the plat
form is right But when asked to surrender to
you my principles as an honest man I cannot
do that; I realize what it will cost us. I realize
the gibes and sneers and contumely that will
be heaped upon us, but, my feilow-citizens, I
have been through thin before, before the po
litical party to which you belong had being. I
have advocated a cause more unpopular than
this. I have stood for the doctrine of free
men and free speech. lam used to detractions.
I am used to abuse and I have had it heaped
upon me without stint. -;
When the Republican party was organized I
was tnere. ; It has never had a National candi
date since it was organized that' my voice has
not been raised in his support. .It has never
had, until now, a great principle enunciated in
its platform that has not | had my approval.
With its distinguished leaders, its distinguished
men of forty years, I have been in close com
munication and < close friendship. I have
shared its honors, and in its j few defeats j and
disasters. Do you think we can sever our con
nection with a Darty like this until it becomes
a duty, a duty not to our ; States, but a duty to
the people of this great land? [Applause.] y
'â'- Mr. President, there are few men in a politi
cal party that have been more honored than I
have by the people in the State in which they
live. There are few men "in this .convention,
or anywhere else, that have been longer con
nected with this organization ; than I. There
are few men in it who have been more active,
and not one who has been more 'attached to
the great principles of this party than I have
been, and I cannot go out of it without heart
burnings and a feeling no man can appreciate'
who has not endured it; and yet I cannot, be

propositions; that shall put upon this country.

I will go out with ;. the feeling 'that. at least
I maintained my consistency '"â  and ; man

for saying this, so personal, but yet I think it
but just to myself ( and my associates I should
proclaim to you that we} take this step, not in
anger, t not in pique, not because we dislike
the nominee or otherwise, but because our
consciences require, as ' honest ( men, that we
should make this sacrifice, for a sacrifice â¢ we
feel that it Is.
Thanking you, eentlemen, for your kind at
tention^ retiring from ' you as I*. do, perhaps
never again to have the opportunity of address
ing a I Republican ' Convention, I cannot do it
without .saying" that,7 after all I have on my

mable privilege of again addressing you.
After Teller - had said: : "I must sever
my connection with ; the political party
which makes a gold plank one of the princi
ple articles of its faith," the Senator paused
and swept his eyes . across the hall. The
galleries rose with a yell and mingled with
the yell was a ' fusilade : of ; hisses. >â  A mo
ment after, when he said, "If under such
circumstances he would be ; unfaithful to
his trust," enthusiastic cries of "No, no,"
came from delegates in the Western and
Southern States. There was pathos in the
Senator's voice - and those nearest . him
could detect the glimmer of tears when
he said there would be heartburnings and
grief in the sacrifice he and his colleagues
were to make for . their consciences.
When Teller folded his arms and â  sank
into his seat cheers began with the silver
men in the â¢ galleries and were caught up
by many gold delegates, who were on
their feet from admiration of the man, not
his cause. This time the hisses were very
few. â ' *.-.' ;'â . . % - '
The demonstration was followed by loud
cries of ''Foraker, Foraker," from all parts
of the hall.
Foraker of . Ohio, chairman of the com
mittee on resolutions, moved to lay Teller's
substitute on the table. 'Senator Lodge of
Massachusetts seconded the motion. The
ayes and noes were demanded by the
States of Colorado, Montana and Idaho,
and the vote was taken. The calling of
the roll was often greeted with applause
when, on a poll of States being demanded.
some well-known delegate recorded bis
vote. This was particularly the case when
U.S. Grant, in the California delegation,
following after L. A Sheldon, Garfield's
chum, and J. A. Spreckels voted for silver
by recording a "no" on the motion to lay
Teller's substitute on the table.
As States usually classed as silver States,
such as Nebraska, North. Dakota, Oregon
and South Dakota, cast their votes in favor
of tabling the resolution, and added to the
rapidly growing majority in favor of that
motion, there were demonstrations of de
light from the exulting gold standard
men. When Alaska was reached one of
the delegates from that Territory asked if,
under the new rules as adopted yesterday,
Alaska was not entitled to four votes, in
stead of two. The chair replied in the
affirmative. ! Alaska then voted four ayes.
The District of Columbia being called,
Colonel Perry Carson, the gigantic colored
delegate who shares with Andrew Gleason
(white) the representation of the National
capital, supplied one of the most humor
ous incidents of the day. Raising ' his
towering form to its full- height, he said,
with bis peculiar negro dialect: -."'.-
"Mr. Chairman, ayes so and so; noes so
and. so. I want to know what it all
means."
Being informed, he said "Then we'
have voted right." ;
The result of the rollcall was ' announced :
Ayes 818%, noes 105 J_. So the motion to
lay Senator Teller's substitute free-silver
plank on the table was carried. Vi
Mr. Foraker was recognized to move the
previous question on the passage of the
resolutions.
Senator Dubois of Idaho, rising ;in the
body of the hall, asked that a separate
vote-be taken on the financial plank.
There were cries of ''No." The previous
question was ordered < with only a few
feeble noes. HSBSSShHâ
-Dubois demanded a rollcall of States
on the passage of the financial plank, and
Colorado and Montana seconded the call.
The y chairman said the question â¢ to be
voted on was: "Shall the financial plank
be adopted as the sense of this conven
tion On this the roll of States was
called.
The rollcall proceeded amid. so much
confusion that the chairman had to sus
pend /it until order was restored. Mean
time ; the â¢ two. - secretaries were puzzling
over the result ' of ' the vote as announced
on the -previous motion, which footed up
apparently more delegates ' than there
were in the convention. -
The result of the rollcall on the question
of the adoption of the financial plank was
announced: Ayes 812>_. noes 110>_. .
"And the financial plank :is adopted,"
added the chairman, amid cheers.
Â The rest of ,the platform was adopted
with ringing cheers of ayes, there being
but one " solitary no. The chair answered
that it was required, as a question of per
sonal privilege, that a statement prepared
by certain members of this convention be
read. y r ..;'â '.
y "Is there objection?" he asked. Wait
ing a few seconds and receiving no re
sponse, â¢ he announced : .
"As a matter of personal privilege the
chair will permit ; Senator Cannon â : to read
the statement, and the chair asks respect
ful attention and perfect quiet." . ' ' \ .7_"
y Frank Cannon, they youthful Senator
from Utah, advanced to the platform and,
with Senator Teller sitting by his side,
read, in ringing tones and with many ges
tures, the following protest:
On announcing the purpose asserted in this
paper it is due to our constituents and to our
selves that there shall be a public showing of
vindicating facts., r. , Â' \
- The sole authorized expression ; of ; National
Republican ,; faith ; from June, 1892, until the
present date has been the platform adopted in
National Convention at Minneapolis. ':' Neither
the utterances of State conventions nor the at-,
titude of individuals could change the tenor I
of , that ' platform or abate the sanctity of its.
binding force. Every delegate to this con
vention was elected as its adherent and its
advocate. True, one of its most important
paragraphs has been subjected to such a diver
gence of construction as to make its language
unsatisfactory during the intervening time
and dangerous if continued in the future, but
of the intent contained within that language
there has never been a doubt. .
It is the province of this convention to re
vise the party tenets | and to announce anew
the.party purpose. The majority of this con
vention has this day made official enunciation
of Republican law and gospel. With much of
j the platform we agree, believing that in many
essential particulars it comprises the needs- of
humanity, affirms the- maintenance ot right
and proposes the best remedy for wrong. But
it declares one elemental principle not only
directly in contravention of the expression of
party faith in 1892, but in radical opposition
to our solemn conviction. V ;'.;
. We recognize that in all matters of mere
method it is but just and helpful that the mi
nority shall yield to the majority, lest we have
chaos In parties and government. But as no
pronouncement by majorities can change op
posing knowledge or belief sincerely enter
tained, so it cannot oblige majorities to aban
don or disavow their principles. As surely as
it is requisite for peace and progress that mi
norities shall yield to majorities in matters of
mere method, just so surely is it necessary for
that same peace and progress that minorities
shall not yield in matters of fundamental
truth.
The Republican platform of 1892 affirmed
that. American people favored bimetallism
and demanded the use of both gold and silver
as standard money. This was accepted by us
as a declaration in behalf of the principle upon
which rests the interest . of every citizen and
the safety of the United States. .In such terms
the platform was then satisfactory to the be
lievers : in ' bimetallism within our party;
only because of equivocal declaration
and evasion has it since been demon
strated to be insufficient. The platform this
day adopted in the National Republican Con
vention at St Louis says:
The Republican party Is unreservedly for â  sound
money. | It caused the enactment of the law pro
viding for the resumption of specie payment in
1879.' Since then every dollar has been as good as
gold. f
We are unalterably opposed to every measure
calculated to debase our currency or impair the
credit of our country. We are, therefore, opposed
to the free coinage of silver, except by Inter
national agreement with tbe leading commercial
nations of the world, which we pledge ourselves to
promote, and until such an agreement can be
obtained the existing gold standard must be main
tained. All our silver and paper currency now in
circulation must be maintained at parity with gold,
and we favor . all measures designed to maintain
inviolable these obligations of tbe United states,
and ; all our money, either coin or paper, at ; the
present standard, the standard of the most en
lightened nations of the earth.
As the declaration of 1892 has been, by a
majority of the party, construed to justify a
single gold standard for our monetary basis
and as the recent trend of the official power
of the party has been in that direction, we can
but assume that the money plank of the new
platform, being much more favorable to per
petuate gold monometallism,; will be deter
minedly : used in behalf of that idea. The
Republican party has won power and renown
by pursuing its purposes courageously and
relentlessly. It is, therefore, only in accord
with the party's history to assume that if it
shall come to political authority in the United
States it will crystallize the administration
under this tempting platform into perpetual
single gold standard in ourfinances.
. This, if long continued, will mean the abso
lute ruin of the producars of the country and,
finally, of the Nation itself.
.The American people not only favor bi
metallism from tradition and interest but
from that wise instinct which has always been
manifest in the affairs of a people destined for
a world's leadership. Under the operation of
our' great demand. for advancement we have
become to other nations the greatest debtor
Nation of the world. We pay the vast charges
which every year accumulate against us in
the clearing-houses of the world with the
money of j the world procured by the disposal
of our commodities in the markets of the
world. Wo are a Nation of producers. Our
creditors are nations of consumers. :
, Any system .of international or National
finance which elevates the price of human
product makes our burden lighter and gives
promise of that day when it shall be entirely
lifted and our country freed financially, as it
is politically, from the domination of mon
archy and foreign autocracy. Any system of
finance which tends to . depreciate the price
of human products, which we must sell abroad,
but in so far adds to the burden of our debt
and conveys a threat of the perpetual servi
tude of the producers of | our debtor Nation to
the consumers of creditor nations. .'â¢... Â;,*
To us it is a folly without a parallel that this
country or any political, party, therein should
deliberately accept a money system which en
riches others at our cost. History, philosophy,
morals, all join with the commonest instinct
of self-preservation . In demanding that the
United States shall have a just and substan
tially unvarying standard composed of all
available gold and silver, and with it our coun
try will progress to financial enfranchisement.
But with a single gold standard the country
will go on to worse destruction, to continued I
falling prices, until our people would become
the hewers of wood and the drawers of water!
for the consumers in creditor nations of the
earth.
. To such an unholy end we will not lend onr
selves. Dear ; as has been the ; Republican
name to its adherents, that name is [ not so
dear as the faith itself and we do not sacrifice
one jot or tittle of the mighty principles by
which Republicanism; has uplifted the world
when we say that at this parting of ; the waya .
we cling to the faith; let the name go where It
will. ' ",-; â  ""' ,''" ;'-V. '-v..
We â  hold â¢ that this ; convention has seceded
from the truth; that the triumph of such se
cession would be the eventual destruction of
our freedom and our civilization. To that end
the people will not knowingly follow any poll- '
tical party and we choose to take our place in '
the ranks of the great mass of citizens who be
lieve that the hour has come for justice.
Did we deem this issue less ; important to
humanity we would yield, since the ; associa
tions of all our political lives have been inter
twined with the men and the measures of this
party and its past mighty achievements. But
the people cry aloud for relief. ."â¢
â¢ They are bending beneath a burden growing â¢
heavier with the passing hours; endeavor no
longer brings its just j reward. Fearfulness
.takes the place of courage, and despair usurps
the throne of hope; and unless the laws of the
country, and unless the policies of political
parties shall be converted Into mediums of re
dress, the effect of human desperation may
some time be witnessed here as in other lands
ana in other ages.
; Accepting the flat of this convention as the
present ; purpose of the party,' we -.withdraw
from this convention to ; return to our con
stituents the authority with which they vested
us, believing that we have* better discharged
their trust ' by this action which restores to :
them authority unsullied j than > by; giving
cowardly and -, Insincere indorsement (to . the
greatest wrong ever willfully attempted within
the Republican . party;â once, redeemer -, of the
people, â¢; but ' now about . to become their op
pressor, unless; providentially lestrained by
the votes of free men.
When Mr. Cannon had nearly finished
the ; reading , of the -'r document - cries '; of
"Time!" and counter cries of "Let him
finish!" were raised, .;' The chair again ap-
, pealed for respectful attention to the pro
test, which he said was nearly finished, y
7 At his closing words, declaring that the
Republican party, once the redeemer of
the people/was now about to become its
oppressor, a storm of hisses and groans
was raised Irom ) all parts of the hall and
cries of "Down!" were raised. "
7 The chair, with bis resonant voice rising
above the tumult, said: 7y7
. "The chair suggests to this convention
56
that the Republican party, in convention
assembled, need not fear any declara
tionâ"
Here an outburst of cheers, which lasted
several seconds, interrupted the chair
man. "When they had subsided he con
tinued :
"And the chair further suggests, in the
interests of the Republican party, that
whatever is to be said within reasonable
limits by those who can no longer remain
in our organisation ought to be listened to
with respectful attention, believing that
full answer to all such declarations will be
made by the great majority of the Ameri
can people at the polls next November."
[Applause.]
The names of the signers to the protest,
as read by the secretary, were greeted with
hisses, and a voice in the rear called out:
"Good-by, all my lovers; good-by," as
Teller and his associates went out of the
hall. The whole convention arose and
yelled, waved hats, flags and fans, while
the band played patriotic airs, the assem
blage singing the chorus, "Three cheers
for the red, white and blue," to the ac
companiment of the band, and shouting
till they were hoarse. The chair, when
the tumult had in some measure subsided,
said:
"Gentlemen of the Convention : There
seem to be enough delegates left to do
business. [Great cheers.] The chair now
asks that the gentleman from Montana,
who did not go outâ^-\' .
Here an outburst of cheering drowned
the rest of the sentence, and cries were
made for Lee Mantle. fie was asked to
ccme to the platform, but declined to do
so. Senator Mantle stood on his chair in
the rear of the hall, facing the chair, and
spoke as follows :
I desire to say that a majority of the delega
tion from the State of Montana have not felt
that, under all the circumstances surrounding
this occasion; they were justified in actually
going out ot the convention. [Applause.]
But, Mr. Chairman, I am bound to say, in
deference to the opinions and wishes of the
majority of the Republicans of the State of
Montana, that we cannot give cur approval or
our indorsement to the financial plank this
day adopted. [Applause.] I have never cast
my vote for any ticket but a Republican one,
and Ido not propose to do it now. [Applause.]
But. Mr. Chairman, we have instructions 'from
the Republicans of our State, and we would be
false to them and false to ourselves if we.did
not state their position and their objections at
this time.
In the name and on behalf of the Republi
cans bl Montana, I protest earnestly, solemnly
and emphatically against the financial plank
ot the platform adopted this day. [Applause.]
We cannot accept it; we cannot indorse
it; we cannot support it at this time.
But there is' a difference of opinion in
this delegation. There are those who are
satisfied to utter their protest and still partici
pate in the progress of the convention. There
are others who feel that in declining to sup
port this great controlling issue they are in
honor bound not to participate in the placing
of a candidate on a platform which they can
not at this time indorse. But, whatever the ac
tion of the delegation may be, I want to say
that we reserve the right to the Republicans of
the State of Montana, to accept or reject, at
such time and in such manner as they may
dete.-mine, the platform and the candidates
put before them by this convention.
Senator Brown of Utah rose to a ques
tion of privilege, and the chair, in accord
ing him the floor, expressed a hope that
the request had not been made for the
purpose of saying anything offensive to
the convention. Senator Brown spoke to
the platform and said:
Mr. Chairman: The delegation from Utah
does not bolt. We do not believe that the Re
publican party is the oppressor of the people,
but the guardian of liberty and the protector
of honest government. [Applause.] Three of
our delegation have gone, and I am here to
express our sorrow at their departure. We
have asked them to remain, and we shall never
cease to regret their departure. [â¢Good #and
cheers.] We have three delegates left "and
three alternatesâ Messrs. Rogers, Green and
Emithâ all true to the old party and who are
as loyal to its principles, and as fixed as the
everlasting mountains where we live. [Cheers.]
In saying this we still remain true to the
principles of free gold and free silver at the
old ratio. We do not believe this question can
be settled by votes in a convention. The test
of time can only settle it, and we believe when
it shall be settled in this way it will be for the
reinstatement of silver as the constitutional
money.
But I promised not to speak on this subject.
There is one great issue before the American
peopleâ ODe to which the Republican party
was pledged years and years ago. You have
promised to the people of the United States
an American tariff, an American issue.
[Cheers.]
' You must send protection to the farmer, to
the manufacturer, and I say to you that Utah
âor at least a part of will endeavor to help
you in that cause. [Cheers.]
' Senator Brown concluded by asking that
the three alternates he had named be
allowed to sit in the convention in place
of the delegates who had left. The chair
man said that unless objection was made
it would be so ordered. Lindsey Rogers,
Webb Green and A. Smith were then
seated as delegates from Utah.
The chair next recognized Mr. Burleigh
of Washington. Mr. Burleigh, speaking
from the platform, said the young State of
Washington yielded her place for patriotic
devotion to loyal allegiance to this Gov
ernment and the tenets of this party to
none.
"We did not come here," he said, "for
inspiration on the silver question. We
brought our inspiration with us. We be
lieve in the single gold standard because
we believe the the money which pays the
banker in Wall street his interest is none
too good to pay the laborer in Montana."
Then he added that with protection,
reciprocity and the chosen standard
bearer, William McKinley, Washington
would give a good account of herself in
November.
This was the first time McKinley' name
had been publicly mentioned in . the pro
ceedings and it was received with cheers.
Outside the convention hall quite an
ovation was given Mr. Teller. Bareheaded
he walked arm in arm with several of . his
associates to the pavement, where car
riaees were in waiting.
It was evident that the walkout had
been arranged, for the carriages at once
drove to the curb and carried off the
.party.
When asked if he cared to say anything,
Mr. Teller replied that be had said all that
was necessary when he expressed his sen-
timents and bade the party with which he
had .been associated for a lifetime a long
adieu.
"I may, however," he continued, "say
that Mr. Thurston's statement that the
Republican party need fear no declaration
is hardly correct. The party does fear
this. declaration, and the facts are all
against them." y7y
Senator Teller, who' was well-nigh pros
trated by the nervous strain, was hurried
to a private room in " one of the - hotels
where he would not be molested, in order
to enjoy needed rest and quiet.
The remainder . of the party was driven
at once to the St. Nicholas, where the
stirring events of the afternoon were dis
cussed. 7'^fifIBBPBI_MBfIHHHB9
Senator Pettigrew of : South Dakota, dis
cussing the situation, said :
"I consider the question of finance of
necessity the only vital issue in the ; cam
paign. I felt bound to .throw the weight
of my influence and efforts on the side of
the producers of wealth rather than on
the side of the selfish manipulators of the
golden world.
"The single gold standard only means
TrrrrT" i i " -fii - -f iiiTnVf fiiMwia ââ â âl'liiifTh urn BY â â !â 
lower prices, greater distress and a further
accumulation of the entire property of the
world in the hands of the owners of credit.
"I believe that reciprocity, protection
and silver are absolutely essential to each
other, and I can see no sense or reason in
authorizing financial unity with the
nation against whom we wage industrial
warfare. The gold-using nations of 'the
world are the creditors, the producers of
the things we produce, and it is against
them we build a tariff wall.
"The issue of protection, however, is no
longer one of principle, but simply a ques
tion of rates of duty, for the Wilson bill is
a protective tariff measure witn
rates of duty slightly below those
imposed <by the McKinley act,
and while lam still earnestly in favor of
the protective tariff, end shall vote to per
petuate it on any occasion, still my action
to-day does not prevent me from voting
for an increase of either ad valorem or
specific duties.
"The delegation from my State was not
instructed on the financial question. We
were instructed only for McKinley. The
convention decided that whereas there
was a difference of opinion among â â  the
Republicans of our State on the
financial question, it would make no
deliverance on that subject until after the
National Convention, thereby leaving me
absolutely free to exercise my independ
ent judgment.- I - did ' not feel,
after a plank bad been adopted
which I could not support either
in the campaign or at the pollsâ and which
is the only essential question before the
American people that i could remain
and participate thereafter in this conven
tion. These are my reasons for joinine
Mr. Teller to-day."
Congressman Charles Towns of Minne
sota spoke very bitterly of the action of
tbe convention.
"I was a Republican at 1:45 o'clock this
afternoon," he said. "I have not changed
my opinion. If I have not somebody else
has, and that somebody else is the con
vention that to-day declared for gold. I
believe 1 am modest when I say that
at least 75 per cent of the people
are against the adoption of the gold stand
ard, and I believe a very large percentage
of the Republican voters of the country
will repudiate the platform adopted by
their convention in St. Louis."
Congressman Hartman of Montana made
the positive declaration that not one of the
Western States could be carried for Mc-
Kinley on the platform provided for it,
and he believes that California, Oregon
and Washington will all go hand in hand
with the silver-producing States that lie
immediately east of the Pacific Coast.
A sample of the messages being re
ceived by the silver men from . their con
stituents in the West is found in a mes
sage received by Mr. Hartman from ex-
State Senator W. E. Thompson, a Repub
lican leader in one of the largest wool
growing counties in that State. Mr.
Thompson says:
We are with you. No straddle. Walk out
and nominate Teller and protection.
"All I care to say," remarked Senator
Dubois of Idaho, "is that a very dig
nified statement was being made
that neither the Republican nor any
other party could coerce the con
sciences of men, and Mr. Thurston replied
in a very dramatic manner that the
voters in November next' would show
whether they could coerce our con
sciences or not. We could not agree
to support a ticket on the platform
that was adopted, and the only consistent
thing left for us to do was to walk out.
That we did, and every, man who walked
out of that convention at once removed
his badge and threw off his loyalty to the
Republican party until such ' time as it
shall return to the principles that have
been its guide during all these years."
Senators Mantle and Carter and Hon. T.
C. Marshall of the Montana delegation
jointly stated after the convention that
their refusal . to walk oat of the conven
tion should not be construed as in any
manner constituting an acceptance of the
terms of the platform on the financial
question.
They further stated that the entire dele
gation was united in unalterable and un
qualified opposition to the platform
adopted, in so far as the financial question
is concerned. They disagreed with their
colleague, Mr. Hartman, only as to the
extent of their authority to act for the Re
publicans of their State.
Five of the delegation felt that they
would be most faithfully and correctly dis
charging their trust by entering their
protest against the platform and reserv
ing the right unto themselves and
the Republicans they represented to
either accept or repudiate the platform and
the candidates after full and free confer
ence in such manner and at such time as
the party of the State of Montana might
assemble to confer and act.7J_R_BÃ
Mr. Hartman felt that he could properly
walk out of the convention, notwithstand
ing his representative capacity. The five
who remained would as a personal mat
ter have gone out. As representatives of
their State they felt tbey were not
authorized to leave the convention if the
convention would permit them to stand
mute on the question, while renouncing
the platform and reserving for the Re
publicans of the State the right to act as
they pleased.

COMMENTS ON THE COAST
How the Naming of McKinley
Is Received by the Re-
publicans.
STOCKTON, Cal., June 18.â Shortly
after 4 o'clock, when it became generally
known that McKinley had been nom
inated on the first ballot, the town was in
an uproar for a time. Some ardent Mc-
Kinleyites secured a small cannon and
fired a number of volleys on the wharf
near the flourmills and steamboat sheds.
That was the signal for , the factories and
mills to join in the demonstration, and
soon every whistle in town was going at
full blast. This was kept up for hours. ;
A large platform has been erected on
the plaza, and here a big -gathering will
ratify the nomination of the great protec
tionist. Speeches will be made by prom
inent Republicans, and; local leaders of
the party are now busy arranging the
programme. It is not definitely settled
yet when this big open-air meeting will
be held, but the arrangements will prob
ably be completed in time to hold it on
Saturday night. y^yyv 7 y
To-night those who are elated over Mc-
Kinley's nomination are discharging fire
crackers and bombs, and the many Re
publicans here are wearing happy faces.
SPOKANE BOLTERS.
Prominent Republicans Who Will Cast
Their Lot With Teller.
SPOKANE, Wash., June 18.âTwenty
five prominent Republicans this afternoon
sent the following telegram to St. Louis:
Hon. H. if. Teller cr Fred Dubois, and Their
Associates: We, the undersigned Republicans,
admire your course and approve your action,
and stand ready to follow your leadership, and
we pledge you' the State of Washington. We
state further that the Republicans of this State
are misrepresented in the National Convention
on the financialquestion. , y. 7 Â» y
â¢ The first signer to this was Judge George
Turner, one of the ; most . prominent Re
publicans in the Northwest and president
of the Leroi, one of the largest if not the
largest gold mine in America. ...He was a
prominent 7 candidate for Senator two
years ago. 7 W. C. Jones, Attorney-General
of the State, twice elected on the Repub
lican ticket, was next. John R. McÃride,
who has been in Oregon politics, and is a
brother of y Senator McÃride, was the
third. All the balance are equally well
known. ,â . -, :. ' - n' ' Yy
About the same number of Republicans
were interviewed \ to-day ; by y the * Spokes
man-Review, and all. said that .- as y the
party, had left them they could-: not stand
on the platform' adopted, and would there
fore refuse to support the nominees of the
St. Louis convention. '
Attorney-General Jones, in a long inter
view, says that he has always been Repub
lican, but that he cannot longer vote that
ticket since It has declared against Repub
licanism. He says that he is still a Repub
lican, but i that while he stands where he
always did; he can see in the distance the
party slowly but surely fading 'â¢ from him.
There is but little ; doubt . that J these Re
publicans will y follow the leadership of
Teller in whatever he may do. Washing
ton will not go Republican this fail. -.;..
THE NEWS AT SEATTLE.
Mild , Enthusiasm i Over the '.. Announce-
ment of the Ticket.
, - SEATTLE, Wash., June 18. â McKin-
ley's ' nomination was not " received with
much enthusiasm j iii ; this '.city. The an-
nouncement of his i selection \by the Na
, tional Republican Convention, made here
at 3:20 o'clock, elicited mild applause from
the crowds in front of the bulletin boards,
being hardly more vigorous 'than the
chilly demonstration consequent upon the
news of General Harrison's nomination
four years ago. The silver men were par
ticularly resentful of the convention's
choice as standard bearer.
"McKinley and '. Hobart. We can < beat

IS A RUSSIAN EXILE.
A Delegate Who Can See but One
Standard of Value.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June liâ unique
feature of the convention is a Russian
exile and a Nebraska delegate. His card
reads, "P. Jansen, Nebraska, delegate at

"God hates a coward," declared Mr.
Jansen, "and every honest man does the
same ; and, therefore, on behalf of the Re
publicans of the great State of Nebraska,
I shall vote for tne resolution which de
clares for the gold standard and says just
what it means. The time is past for the
Republican party to straddle this ques
tion. We must meet the issue fairly and
squarely like men. The Democratic party
will not in the least hesitate to use the
word ' 'silver,' and I don't see why we
should be afraid to name the metal which
has been the only measure of values since
the United States began to coin money.
Why, even the country from which I am
an exile, half-civilized Russia, is prepar
ing to get onto a gold basis, and it would
ill become the most enlightened nation of
the globe to take a step backward and join
Mexico, Japan and China.
"Gentlemen, we shall not gain a single
electoral vote by refraining to declare for
a gold standard, but we will . lose the re
spect and the credit of the whole world,
whose eyes are upon this convention, by
avoiding to say just what we '. mean. The
people of Nebraska are anxious and will
ing to pay. their debts, but they are not
ready to liquidate them with a 50-cent dol
lar. I trust, gentlemen, the resolution
will be carried!" '
PROCEEDINGS IN BRIEF.
Review of the Work of the Re-
publican Convention.
. The National Republican Convention at
St. Louis assembled on . Tuesday at noon
in the Convention Hall, being called to
order by Senator Carter, chairman of the
National Committee. Rabbi Sale offered
prayer. ; The call ; for the convention was
read, and the temporary chairman of the
convention, Charles W. Fairbanks of In
diana, was elected, the choice of the
National Committee being ratified.
Mr. Fairbanks made an opening address,
reviewing recent history and saying, "The
Republican party is . a party :of convic
tions." He also paid attention to the
protective tariff and the money question
at length. < At the close of his remarks he
was presented with a gavel fashioned from
a log taken from the cabin which was
built at New Salem, 111., by Abraham
Lincoln in 1832. . . "
â¢ After a vote to abide temporarily by
the rules of the last preceding Republican
Convention, the committees on perma
nent organization, on rules and order of
business, on credentials and on resolu
tions were named. It was voted to sub
mit all resolutions in respect to the plat
form to the convention* without debate. . ".
At C 1:47 the convention . adjourned to
meet Wednesday at 10 a. m. Prior to the
opening of the convention the National
Committee sat and : began -to make up a
temporary roll for ?' the convention, decid
ing contests in which a large number of
delegates were concerned.
v The committee on credentials, at its first
meeting, decided to ' adopt ' the roll pre
pared by the National Committee "as the
true and correct roll of the delegates and
alternates . to the convention," and also
voted to : hear only /the contests : referred
by the National Committee to it. W. P.
Hepburn of lowa moved a substitute in
structing the secretary of the committee
to secure all papers and documents con
cerning contested seats that had been filed
before the National Committee, and that
the committee on credentials should then
proceed to dispose of all contests in alpha
betical order â " of the States. This substi
tute was voted down, 17 to 19.
. The Higgins delegation \ from . Delaware
was seated, 31 to 21, by the committee on
credentials and also the John Grant dele-
gation from Texas.
A minority report was â¢, prepared, which
was signed by W. A. Hepburn of ' lowa, C.
S. Blackett of Maryland, Forrest Goodwin
of Maine and sixteen other members of
the committee. This minority report set
forth that the National Committee did not
attempt ", to - consider 7 the . merits of the
cases of any of ; 150 odd contestants; that
only in two cases, to .wit, concerning the
delegations from Delaware and Texas, had
there -; been ; any . hearing . concerning - the
facts involved by any competent tribunal;
that they National 7 Committee had % per-
sistently ; voted down propositions to in
vestigate cases from Texas other than
those from the State at largeâ from
California, from Louisiana, from 7 Ala
bama and : from the Twelfth District of
Missouri; that it is a dangerous precedent
to permit the National Committee to pass
final judgment on the election and quali
fication of delegates to the National Con
vention, and also that.in the consideration
of contested cases before ; the Republican
National Committee it was distinctly and
repeatedly stated : that the contestants
would have an opportunity to be heard
before the committee on credentials with
their testimony; .â¢_,'â 
The National Convention came together
again Wednesday at 10 a. m. y, i John M.
Thurston, who had been selected \ for/per
manent presiding officer, was] escorted to
the chair by Senator well of New Jersey
and Serehb E. Payne of New York. 7 ' 7> :
Mr. Thurston delivered an addrese after
w hich a recess was taken until after noon.
In the afternoon the reports of the com
mittee on credentials were submitted. .
' Congressman Hepburn ' offered the mi
nority,' report . from tbe "platform,* and
spoke denouncing "snap judgment" in
the matter of credentials. He was re
ceived with applause. >
On the rollcall lowa voted solidly
against the majority report of the commit
tee on ; credentials. The convention
adopted the majority report after a vote
on a motion for . the previous question,
which resulted 568}_ to 329^- 'â 
Before this the .point had been raised,
that until tbe report of the committee on
credentials had been received, the perma
nent officers could not take their seats,
but this was overruled by the temporary
chairman.
The vice-presidents of the convention
from the Pacific Slope were as follows:
California, U. S. Grant; Montana, Thomas
C. Marshall; Nevada. J. B. Overton;
North Dakota, J. M. Devine; Oregon,
John F. Gailbraith; South Dakota, David
Meisner; Utah, W. 8. McCormick; Wash
ington, Alwick , Goldman Arizona, J. M.
Ford.
â  The committee on rules reported rules
almost identical with those previously in
force. Indian ' Territory was given six
votes instead of two and Alaska four in
stead of two. The rules were adopted and
the convention then adjourned for the day.
At a meeting of the committee on reso
lutions Wednesday Senator Teller pro
posed as a substitute for the gold plank
in the platform a plank providing for tbe
free coinage of silver at the ratio with
gold of 16 to 1. This was rejected by the
committeeâ ayes 40, noes 11.
Messrs. Teller of Colorado, Cleveland of
Nevada, Leminon of California, Cannon of
Utah, Mott of North Carolina, Hartman of
Montana and Dubois of Idaho spoke in
the committee against the adoption of the
gold i standard. Messrs. Teller, Cannon,
Cleveland and Dubois gave notice that they
would withdraw from the convention if
that body should adopt the gold standard
plank.
The convention reassembled Thursday
morning at 10 o'clock. A few minutes
later the report of the committee on reso
lutions was submitted by the chairman,
Joseph B. Foraker of Ohio. : The preamble
appealed for popular and historic justifica
tion of the claims of the Republican party
"to the matchless achievements of thirty
years of Republican rule." These achieve
ments were recounted briefly. The planks

Senator Teller submitted a minority re
port from the committee on resolutions
and offered a silver 16 to 1 resolution as a
substitute for the gold-standard plank.
Chairman Foraker of the committee on
resolutions moved to lay the substitute on
the table. This motion prevailed, 818 to
105>_. The financial plank reported by
the majority was then adopted 812}_ to
110>_. ,y7
The following delegates from silver
States walked out of the convention: '-. En
tire delegations from Colorado and Idaho,
three delegates from Utah, one from
Dakota, one from Montana and two from

A brief description of the origin, rise
and growth of the Republican party nec
essarily excludes much of great historical
interest, but in the allotted space it is pos
sible to outline its career from its incep
tion and to point out its glorious achieve
ments. The reader will find herein facts
sufficient to show why the . members of
the great political organization are so
proud to say, "I am a Republican." y
The Michigan State Convention, held in
JacKson in June, 1854, was the first State
representative body to take the name of
Republican in the present acceptation of
that term, and it has been claimed that
this resulted from a suggestion offered by
Horace Greeley. A few weeks later it was
adopted by State conventions in Maine,
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and
lowa.'
In most of the New England States, in
Pennsylvania and in the entire South the
Whig party still kept alive and ran tickets
that year. In the same year the Republi
can party was so extended and strength
ened it succeeded in electing enough Con
gressmen to secure its first National tri
umph in 1855, when Nathaniel P. Banks
of Massachusetts was elected Speaker of
the House.
Most of the Northern States were won in
a single year to the banner of the new
party and a controlling influence had been
secured in the lower house of Congress.
"Its leaders," writes Eugene N. Smalley in
his history of the organization, "were
mostly men of anti-slavery convictions
from the old Whig party, like Fessenden,
Sumner, Greeley, Seward, Chase, Wade
and Chandler, but there were among them
t veral former Democrats. No account
was made of old political affiliations, how
ever, and the only test of membership was
opposition to the encroachments of the
slave power."
Charles Sumner wrote from the Senate
chamber of the United States to a Massa
chusetts committee, under date of May 29,
1854, in the spirit which actuated those
who thought as he did, and who were
largely instrumental in bringing the new
party into existence :
The despotism of the slave power is to be es
tablished, "while you and I and all of us from
the North are to bow down before it. For my
self, I will not bow down; but, gentlemen,
you will understand that no individual can
effectually oppose these schemes. This can
only be done in one way. As all at the South,
without distinction of party, unite for slavery,
so all at the' North, without distinction of
party, forgetting vain differences of Whig and
Democrat, must unite for freedom, and, rising
in majesty and might, take control of the Na
tional Government." f
In 1820 the famous "Missouri compro
mise" had been adopted by Congress.
This measure ; form
ally appeared in Con
gress in the month of
December, 1818.
What Brought
the Party
Into Existence.
When the bill pro
posing to admit Missouri as a slave State
came before the House James Tallmadge
Jr. of New York moved to amend It by pro
viding that "the further introduction of
slavery be prohibited in said State of
Missouri, and that all children born in the
State alter its admission to the Union shall
be free at the age of 25 years." The House
passed the bill, but the Senate rejected the
amendment. Tne story of what followed
has been told by James G. Blame in his
"Twenty Years of Congress" :
Mr. Clay, then an accepted leader of Southern
sentiment, which in his later life he ceased to
be, made an earnest, almost fiery, speech on
the question. He wanted to know whether
certain doctrines of an alarming character
with respect to a restriction on the admission
of new States west of the Mississippi were to be
sustained on this floor. He wanted to know
what conditions Congress could annex to the
admission* of a new State, whether, indeed,
there could be a partition of its sovereignty?
Despite the eloquence and the great influence
of the speaker the Southern representatives
were overborne and the House adopted the
anti-slavery restriction. The Senate refused to
concur, united Maine and Missouri in one bill,
and passed it with an entirely new feature,
which was proposed by Jesse B. Thomas, a
Senator from Illinois. That feature was simply
the provision, since so widely known as the
Missouri compromise, which forever prohibited
slavery north of 36 deg. 30 mm. in all the ter
ritory acquired from France as the Louisiana
purchase.
The House would not "consent to admit the
two States in the same bill, but finally agreed
to the compromise, and in the early part -of
March, 1850, Maine became & member ,of the
Union without a condition. A separate bill
was passed permitting Missouri to form a
constitution preparatory to her admission,
subject to the compromise, which,' indeed,
formed one section of the enabling act,* . Mis
souri was thus granted permission to enter the
Union as a slave State. But she was discon
tented with the prospect of having free States
on three sidesâ east, north and west. 7
The Missouri compromise was set aside
by Congress on May 30, 1854. "No previ
ous anti-slavery excitement," says Mr.
Blame, "bore any comparison ; with that
which spread through the North as the
discussion progressed, and especially after
the bill became a law. 7lt did not merely
call forth opposition ; it produced a frenzy
of wrath on the part pf thousands and tens
of thousands in both the old parties who
had never before taken any part whatever
in anti-slavery agitation. The most strik
ing result in the political field produced by
the repeal of the Missouri compromise was
the utter destruction of the Whig party.
The majority )in *. the - North came ; to see
that -it was jin reality nothing ..- but ' a
struggle between the slave States and the
free States, growing : more and more , in
tense and more and more dangerous â¢ day
by day."- - J ?. ~' - ? ' ''"
The Republican party owed its birth to
the anti-slavery agitation. The band of
abolitionists, which embraced Garrison,
Phillips, John G. Whittier, Fred Douglass
and others, had awakened public senti
ment against slavery, and particularly
against the extension of the institution
into new territory. There is no apology
to be made for the origin of the party. It
was the party of freedom. A few years
later it caused 4,000,000 slaves to be free.
Mr. Blame wrote :
The same name was not at once adopted in
all the free States in 1854, but by the ensuing
year there was a general recognition through
out the North that all who intended to make
a serious fight against the pro-slavery Democ
racy would unite under the flag of the Repub
lican party.
In its very first effort, without compact or
ganization, without discipline, it rallied , the
anti-slavery sentiment so successfully as to
carry nearly all the free States and to secure a
plurality of the members of the House of Rep
resentatives. The indignation of : the people
knew no bounds. Old political landmarks dis
appeared and party prejudices of three genera
tions were swept aside in a day. . With such
success â in < the outset the Republicans pre
pared for a vigorous struggle in the approach
ing election. â  â¢-./.
The way had been : paved :by the Pree
soilers and by the Abolitionists. Tbe re
peal of the Missouri compromise brought
nearer "the struggle which eventuated in
the Civil War after the struggle in Kansas
and other events had brought on "the irre
pressible conflict." v
Again Mr. Blame is quoted on this point :
In the South they saw and felt their danger,
and they determined at ; all hazards to defend
themselves against policies which i involved
the total destruction of their social and indus
trial fabric. They were not mere malcontents.
They were not pretenders. . They did not aim
at small-things. They had ability and they
bad r courage. They . had determined upon
mastery within the Union or a continental
empire outside of it.
So much in general for the cause which
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 19. 1896.
immediately led " up . to the formation of
the Republican party. â  The .ad vice yof
Charles Sumner had been taken, and men
of all parties flocked [ together to place an
effectual curb on the extension of slavery.
The first Republican National Conven
tion to nominate candidates for the Presi-
dency and Presi
dency of the United
States was held in
Philadelphia in the
month of June. 1856.
The First
Republican National
Convention. V ,-,
John C. Fremont was . nominated for
President and William L. Dayton of New
Jersey for Vice - President. The prin
ciples enunciated by the Republican and
Democratic parties on :\ the il slavery ques
tion formed the on subject for discussion
during the canvass in the free States. y
Electoral tickets ; for Fremont were not
presented in the slave ' States, and Fill
more had a weakened ; support in â  these
States, so that the contest was practically
narrowed to a fight in the North between
Fremont and Buchanan. Northern Demo
crats sought to avoid the slavery question
during their -campaign, and handled the
matter very skillfully. The Republicans
carried every. Northern State, except Penn
sylvania, New ' Jersey, 'Indiana, Illinois
and California, and ' gave J to the ticket 114
electoral votes. The Americans carried
only Maryland. Buchanan had -174 elec
toral votes. Of the popular vote Buchanan
received 1,838,169; g Fremont, % 1,341,264;
Fillmore, 874,354. Buchanan had a decided
plurality, but 'he lacked 377,629 votes of | a
majority. This campaign first â¢ brought
forth mention of Abraham Lincoln as a
National candidate. In the convention
which nominated Fremont and 'Dayton
Lincoln received 110 votes to 259 votes for
Dayton for; Vice-President. : Dayton was
made the ' unanimous nominee for \ the
Vice-Presidency. ."-- - .;â¢'â¢ ........ y YYv,
The administration of Buchanan em
braced the period during which ; "the ordi
nance of secession" became a fact in
American history. The four years follow
ing the inauguration of Buchanan were
filled with exciting events, Abraham
Lincoln achieved National prominence
through his joint debates with Stephen A.
Douglas. These debates were listened to
by tens of thousands. Their fame "spread
throughout the country. Tho.Dred Scott
decision had inflamed the Northern mind.
The "Lecompton constitution" of Kansas
had been transmitted by Buchanan to
Congress. The John Brown raid had taken
place at Harpers Ferry. The Democratic
party had been split into opposing wings.
Several members of the Buchanan Cabinet
retired because tuey took issue with Bu
chanan concerning the right of the Gov
ernment to prevent the secession of a
State from the Union. The conventions
of 1860 had brought about a complete polit
ical revolutibn.'i's^^^^^P^V-

by Stephen A. Douglas, and the North

of : the 7 powers 70f7 â  ; the " territorial

party would abide by the decision of the
Supreme Court on the question of const!
tutional law. , Most of the Southern dele
gates then withdrew from the convention
and an adjournment was taken until June
18, when the convention reassembled Jat
Baltimore., The' seceding delegatesl; met
and adopted a platform and adjourned to
meet in Richmond June 11. The outcome
of all this" was tbat the Democrats had two
National tickets in the field, one of which
bore the names of ; Stephen A. Douglas of
Illinois for President and Benjamin Fitz
patrick of Alabama for Vice-President,
This ticket and its following represented
: the "squatter sovereignty" â  doctrine! pro

represented the extreme desiras^f the

The second Republican National Nom

terest for many reasons, not the : least of
which resides in the fact- that the Presi
dential nominee was Abraham Lincoln.
At 12 o'clock noon, on Wednesday, the

can Convention met
in Chicago, Illinois.
The convention was

ing on Lake street,
known &a the "Wigwam," erected for
the purpose. As soon as the doors
were opened the entire , body of the
Wigwam was solidly, packed with men,
the galleries being . equally packed . with
ladies. There were not less than ten
thousand persons in the building", while
an immense crowd were unable to get in
side.
Governor E. D. Morgan of New York,
chairman of the National Republican Com
mittee, called the convention to order, read
the call and delivered the following ad
dress: .
Usage has made it my duty to take the pre
liminary step toward , organizing . the conven
tionâa convention upon the proceedings of
which, permit me to say, the most momentous
results are depending. No body of men of
equal number was ever clothed with greater
responsibility than those within the hearing
of my voice. You do not need me to tell you,.
gentlemen, what the responsibility is. While
one portion of the adherents of the National
administration are * endeavoring â¢ to } insert a
slave code into the party platform, another por
tion j exhibits ; Its readiness to accomplish tne
same result through the action of the Supreme
Court of the United States, willing, by the in-'
dication, to do indirectly that which, if done
directly, 7 would ; bring ' a blush even â to the
cheek of modern Democracy.
Whilo these ; and other stupendous wrongs
absolutely shocking to the moral sentiment of
the country â¢ are to be fastened ; upon ; the peo
ple 'by the â¢ party . in power if j its leaders are
able to bring the factious elements that com
pose : it : into l any ; degree .â  of y unanimity there
seems left no ray of hope * except in ' the good
sense of this convention. ,
7 Let us, then, invoke you to act in a spirit of
harmony, that by the dignity, the wisdom and
the patriotism displayed; here J you may be en
abled to enlist the hearts of .; the people and to
strengthen them in the faith that yours ls the
constitutional party of the ) country, and ": the
only constitutional party; 7: that . you 7; are
actuated ;by ; principles and \ that you will be
guided by the light and by the example of the
fathers of the Republic. -
Hon. David Wilmot of Pennsylvania,
'the temporary , chairman, on taking the
chair spoke as follows :
A great sectional. and aristocratic party, or,

Nothing but Â« a momentous question would

nothing but deep sense of the danger into
which our Government is fast running could
have rallied the people thus in this city to-day
for the purpose ;of rescuing the Government
from the deep degradation into which it has
fallen. [Lond applause.] Wo are here in the
ordinary capacity as delegates of the people to
prepare for the formation and carrying on of
a new administration, and with the help of
the people we ' will do . it. [Applause.] No

Representatives. -y [Laughter/and applause.]
The platform ; which was adopted had,
among. others, the . following significant
planks: 7
1. That the history of the Nation during the
last four years has fully established the pro
priety and necessity of â  the organization and
perpetuation " of y the; Republican party; ', and
that 'the 'causes which called it into existence
are permanent in their nature, and now, more
than ever before, demand its peaceful and con
stitutional triumph. 7
â 2. That the maintenance 'â  of the principles
promulgated in the Declaration of Independ
ence and' y embodied -in the 3 Federal
constitution, ''That all men are created
equal; that they, are . endowed y by y their
Creator with certain Inalienable rights;
that among these are life," liberty
and the pursuit of happiness; and to secure
these rights Governments are instituted among
men 'deriving their just powers from the con
sent ol the governed," is essential to the pres
ervation of our . republican institutions; and
that the Federal constitution, the rights of the
States and the union of the States must and
shall be preserved.
3. That to the union of the States this Na
tion owes its unprecedented increase in popu
lation, Its surprising development of material
resources, : its rapid augmentation of wealth,
its y happiness at home and its honor
abroad; and we hold In abhorrence all
schemes for disunion, come from whatever,
source, they may. -And we I congratulate the
country that no Republican member of Con-"
gress has uttered or countenanced the threats
of disunion so often made by Democratic mem
bers; without rebuke, and with applause from
their political ; associates; and we denounce
those threats of disunion, in case of a popular
overthrow of their ascendency, as denying the
vital principles of a free government, and as
an avowal of contemplated treason, which it
is the imperative duty of an indignant people
sternly to rebuke and forever silence,
7. That : the new â  dogma that the const!
tion,' of its own force,
carries . slavery into
any or all of the Ter
ritories of the United
States is a danger-

Slavery a
Political Heresy.
ous political heresy,
at variance with the explicit provisions of
that instrument itself. 'â¢.;â¢'.â "â .
8. That the normal condition of all the ter
ritory of the United States is that of freedom;
that as our republican fathers, when they had
abolished slavery in all our National territory,
ordained that "no person should be deprived of
life, liberty or property without due process
of law, it becomes our duty, by legislation,
whenever such' legislation Is necessary, to
maintain this provision of 'the constitution
against all attempts to violate, it; and wo deny
the authority of Congress, of a Territorial
Legislature, or of any individual, to give legal
existence to slavery in any Territory of the
United States, "*.''â¢
9. That we brand the recent reopening of
the African : slave trade, under the cover o
our . National flag, aided by perversions of
judicial power, as a crime against humanity
and a burning shame to our country and ag%;
and we call upon Congress to take prompt and
efficient measures for the total and final sup-
pression of that execrable traffic. y.
7 12. That, while; providing revenue for the
support of â  the General Government by duties
upon imports, sound policy requires such an
adjustment of these , imports as to encourage
the development of the industrial interests of
the whole country;, and we commend that
policy of National exchanges which secures to
the workin liberal wages, to agriculture
remunerative prices, to mechanics and man-
ufacturers an adequate reward for their skill,
labor and enterprise and to the Nation com-
mercial prosperity and independence.
Their platform was adopted on"; the
second day' of the convention with a great
show of enthusiasm. â  The ' nominations
were made on the succeeding day. Wil
. liam y varts nominated 7 William I ' H.
Seward, and ; there .were several speeches
seconding "this- nomination, among the
speakers being Austin Blair of Michigan
and Carl Scburz of Wisconsin. The nomi-
nation of Abraham Lincoln was made by,
N. B.'Judd of Illinois, and Caleb Smith of
Indiana seconded. The other candidates
for the Presidential nomination were
Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania, William
Lay ton of "< New- Jersey, ward y Bates of
Missouri, John McLean of Ohio and Jacob
j CoUamer of Vermont./" Seward led on the j
first and second ballots, but it was argued
that he could not ; carry the States which'
the Republicans failed to win in 1856, viz. :
Pennsylvania,* Indiana and Illinois, and
on the : third ballot Lincoln was nomi
nates. Hannibal Hamlin of. Maine was
nominated for Vice-President.
Much has been written by James G.
Blame concerning this period of more
than ordinary interest :
"j It.is 'one of the "contradictions not Infre-
It ls one of the contradictions not infre
quently exhibited in partisan bodies that Mr.
Seward was defeated because of his radical ex
pressions | on the slavery question, while ; Mr.
Lincoln was chosen in spite of I expressions far
more radical than those of Mr. Seward. The
"Irrepressible . conflict" announced by Mr.
Seward at Rochester did not go as far as Mr.
Lincoln's declaration at Springfield, that "the
Union could not exist half-siave, half-free."
Neither, Mr. Seward nor Mr. Lincoln contem
plated the destruction of the Government, and
yet thousands had been made to believe that
Mr. Seward made the existence of the Union
depend upon the abolition of slavery. .
Mr. Lincoln | had announced the same doc
trine in advance of Mr. Seward, with direct
ness and bluntness which could not be found
in the more polished phrase of the New York
Senator. ; Despite these facts, a large number
of . delegates from ' doubtful - Statesâ delegates
who held the control of the conventionâsup
ported Mr. Lincoln on the distinct ground that
the anti-slavery sentiment which they repre
sented was not sufficiently radical to support
the author of the speech in which had been
proclaimed the doctrine of an irrepressible
conflict between freedom and slavery.
While there were four Presidential
tickets in the field a positive policy could
be justly attributed to only two. Mr. Lin
coln favored the prohibition of an exten
sion of slavery by law. Mr. Breckinridge
favored laws to promote its extension.
During the campaign the Republican
orceswere strengthened by accessions from
the Douglas following. The division of
the Democrats helped Mr. Lincoln. His
opponents joined in one electoral ticket to
defeat him in New York, New Jersey and
Rhode Island. A fusion ticket was run in
New. Jersey embracing three Douglas, two
Bell and two Breckinridge electors.
Mr. Lincoln secured four of the electoral
votes: in New Jersey. . California and
Oregon gave him pluralities, and . in every
other free State he had majorities. All
the slave States, with . four exceptions,
were carried by Breckinridge. Bell car
ried Maryland, Kentucky and Virginia
and Douglas carried Missouri. The popu
lar vote was as follows: Lincoln, 1,857,
-610; Douglas, 1,291,574; Breckinridge, 850,
-082; Bell, 646.12 L As soon as the results
of the election were known movements for
secession were begun in the "South.
The issue of protection, which has been
consistently advocated by the Republican
party, no doubt had
its effect upon . the
success of the Repub
lican party at . this

time. In evidence of *
the accuracy of this statement the words
of Mr. Blame are once more quoted :
The crushing defeat received in the person
of Wilmot (Free-soil candidate for Governor of
Pennsylvania) occurred on the very eve of the
financial distress "of 1857. The Democratic
canvass had been made while there was yet no
suspicion of impending panic and revulsion
made, indeed, with the constant boast of the
general prosperity, and with constant ascrip
tions of that prosperity to the well- defined and
long-continued policy of the Democratic party.
From that time the Democratic party became
embarrassed in Pennsylvania. With a tariff of
their own making, with a President of their
own choice, with both branches of Congress
and every department of government under
their control, a serious disaster had come upon
the country. ' â .'
The promises of Democratic < leaden had
failed their predictions, had been falsified, and
as a consequence their strength was shattered.
The Republicans of Pennsylvania, seeing this
advantage, pressed it by renewed and urgent
demands for a protective tariff. On the other
issues of the party they had been hopelessly
beaten, but the moment the hostility to slave
labor In the Territories became Identified with
protected labor in Pennsylvania, the party was
inspired with new hopes, indeed, received new
life. â¢ â¢'!'.'.
It â¢ was this condition of public opinion In
Pennsylvania which made the recognition of
the protective system so essential , in . the Chi
cago platform of 1860. It was to that recog
nition that Mr. Lincoln in .the end owed his
election. The memorable victory of Andrew
G. Curtin, when he was chosen Governor by a
mnjority of 32,000, was largely due to his
able and persuasive presentation of the tariff
question, and to his effective appeals to the
laboring men in the coal and iron sections 'of
the State. But . for this issue, In fact, there
no reason why Curtin should have been
stronger in 1860 than Wilmot was in 1857.
Indeed, but for that issue he must have been
weaker. SSSBB9â <I9_SHM
1 - The agitation over the repeal of the Missouri
compromise had somewhat subsided with the
lapse of years; the free State victory in Kansas
was acknowledged and that issue was removed ;
while the Dred Scott decision, failing to arouse
popular resentment at the time it 'was pro
nounced, could hardly be effectual for an
aggressive canvass three years later, j If Gover
nor Curtin could have presented no other issue
to the voters of Pennsylvania he would un
doubtedly .have shared the fate Wilmot met
when he had these anti-slavery questions as
his only platform.
Governor Curtin gave a far greater propor
tion of his time to the discussion of the tariff
and financial \ issues than to all others ' com
bined, and he carried Pennsylvania because a
majority of her voters believed that the Dem
ocratic party tended to free trade and that the
Republican party would espouse and maintain
the cause of protection. â¢
At its successful entry, into American
political control the Republican party was
opposed If to : servile \ labor and strongly
favored protection to American industries,
and it has maintained its position con
sistently throughout.
The withdrawal of . Southern Senators
and Representatives from Congress, :in
pursuance of their policy of secession, left
the Republicans in control. They very
soon enacted the Morrill tariff bill -into a
Jaw. No Democratic Senator voted * for
the bill and no Republican Senator voted
in the negative. The House adopted the
â bill. 7^" lt was a singular combination of
circumstances," remarked Mr. 'Blame,
"which on the: eve of the Southern revolt
led to the inauguration of a policy that
gave such industrial and financial strength
to the Union in its hour of ; dire necessity,
n the very crisis of its fate."
The Republican party throughout the
Civil War was united iin - favor of prose-
cnting v the conflict

mination. The re

and after the second battle of Bull Run
gave * the r Democrats several â * State elec
tions 'and 3 the Republicans had only a
narrow majority in the new House.
The capture of Vicksburg and the Gettys
burg victory strengthened the hands; of
the war party. The Democratic party was
split into two factions. One wing united
with the Republicans in the Union party,
a name that was adopted to permit of this
fusion. The other wing of the Democratic
party sympathized \ with the Y South and
openly declared that the war was a failure.
-,*- The chief event in which the Republi
can party was conspicuous ; during: the
period of 1860.65, apart from ; the conduct
of the Civil War. was the emancipation of
the slaves. The Republican party did not
enter upon war/with the 'purpose ' of abol
ishing slavery, but abolition came about
as a logical conclusion. President Lincoln
said that â  he * would save the Union with
slavery if he could save it so, but that he
78
would save it without slavery if necessary.
The first proclamation of emancipation
was not issued until September 22, 1862.
The Proclamations
of
Emancipation.
That was practi
cally a notice to the
States bearing arms
against the Govern
ment of the United
States that their slaves would be lost
to them if these States failed to re- :
turn to the Union. The second proc
lamation was issued January 1, 1863,
in which all persons held as slaves in the
designated States were declared to.be free,
and the Government of the United States
was pledged to preserve their freedom.
The next step in this direction was the
passage in the House and Senate of the
thirteenth amendment to the constitution
prohibiting slavery in the United States.
This measure was adopted by the Senate
in April, 1864, and by the House in
January, 1865. All the Republicans in
Congress voted for it without exception,
and nearly all the Democrats voted against
it,
Abraham Lincoln was renominated for
President at the Union National Conven
tion at Baltimore in 1864 by acclamation,
Andrew Johnson of Tennessee being made
the nominee for the Vice-Presidency.
Some time prior to this a convention hos
tile to Lincoln was held at Cleveland.Ohio,
at which John C. Fremont was nominated
for President and John Cochrane for Vice-
President. The Cleveland convention
made several radical declarations. The
delegates adopted a platform which called
for suppression of the rebellion without
compromise; declared for the election of
President for one term only; and finally
advocated the confiscation of the lands of
rebels and their distribution among the
soldiers and actual settlers.
General Fremont accepted the nomina
tion but repudiated the platform and
attacked the Lincoln administration. A
mass-meeting was also held at New York,
{he purpose of which appeared to some to
be the advocacy of General Grant as a
Presidential candidate.
The Baltimore convention was called to
order by Governor Morgan of New York,
who advocated a constitutional amend
ment to abolish slavery. Dr. Robert T.
Breckinridge of Kentucky was the tem
porary chairman, and ex-Governor Denni
son of Ohio was elected president.
The Government was pledged support in
carrying on the war. The "determination
of the Government not to compromise
with the rebels nor to offer them any terms
of peace except such as may be based upon
an unconditional surrender of their hos
tility and a return to their just allegiance
to the constitution and laws of the United
States," was approved. The Government
was exhorted to use all its vigor and called
on for a constitutional amendment which
shall terminate and forever prohibit the
existence of slavery within the limits or
jurisdiction of the United States.
President Lincoln was commended for
wisdom, patriotism and fidelity. There
were other declarations, among which was
one of particular interest to the Pacific
Coast, in favor of the speedy construction
of a Pacific railroad.
Abraham Lincoln received all the votes
of the convention with the exception of
twenty-two from Missouri, which were cast
for General Grant under instructions.
The Democrats met at Chicago. The
war measures of the administration were
denounced and emancipation was cen
sured, while an armistice was proposed.
The second resol ution in the platform was
as follows:
Resolved, That this convention. does explic
itly declare, as the sense of the American
people, that after four

for a cessation of hostilities with the view to

earliest practicable moment peace may be re
stored on the basis of the Federal union of the
States. 7- y
General George B. McClellan was nomi
nated for President, and George H. Pen
dleton of Ohio for Vice-President. General
McClellan repudiated the platform. Gen
eral Fremont soon withdrew bis candi
dacy. The Union successes at Fort Mor
gan, Atlanta, and in Mobile Bay came 'at
this time, and the battles of Winchester,
Fishers Hill and Cedar Creek followed
closely.
"With reverses in the field," Said Presi
dent Lincoln, "the case is doubtful at the
polls. With victory in the field the elec
tion will take care of itself."
Twenty-two States took part in. the elec
tion, of which General McClellan received
the electoral votes of only three. He car
ried only one free Stateâ Jersey â
two slave â Kentucky and Delaware.
Maryland, Missouri and West Virginia
voted for Lincoln. The popular vote was
as follows: Lincoln, 2,213,665; McClellan,
1,802,237. Lincoln had 212 electoral votes
against 21 cast for McClellan. The policy
of the administration was indorsed.
What immediately followed is of general
knowledge. The armies of the South
surrendered. Abraham Lincoln was
assassinated not long after his second in
aguration. Andrew Johnson became

The
Reconstruction
Period.
These laws were known as the recon
struction acts and they were vetoed by
President Johnson. They were subse
quently passed over the President's veto.
The Republicans had at this time & two
thirds majority in both of the houses.
Hostility between the Republican Sena
tors and Congressmen and President John
son resulted in impeachment proceedings
against President Johnson. The proceed
ings rested upon the President's removal
of Edwin M. Stanton from the position of
Secretary of War. .;-..'. ' r
In the month yof June, 1866, the four
teenth amendment to the constitution,.
which made citizens of the United States
and of the States in which they lived of
the freed negroes was .adopted by Repub
lican votes exclusively in both houses.
The amendment also provided for dis
qualifying persons who had taken the
oath to : support the Government of
the United States and had fought
against ': the Government from holding
office, and had other provisions to prevent
payment for losses by the emancipation of
slaves, and forbade also the payment by
the United States of ?or any State of any
debt incurred in aid of the war by the se
ceding States. In 1865 the civil rights bill
was passed, providing penalties for any at
tempt to deprive freed men of equal rights.

tional on Janu
ary 1, 1866, amounted to the sum of
$2,793,491,475. In four years following
the war this debt was reduced by the sum
of nearly $300,000,000, while, at the same
time/the Government reduced its revenue
to the amount of $140,000,000 per annum
by repealing a long series of internal rev
enue taxes. During this period also $35,
-000,000 had been . paid from the treasury
toward the construct ion "of the Union and
Central Pacific railroads, and $7,200,000
was paid to the Russian Government on
account of the purchase of Alaska. The
expenses included the disbandment of the
Union army and a very large addition to
the pension list.
The Republican convention of 1868 met
at Chicago, May 16. It was a foregone
conclusion that General Grant would be
Presidential nominee of the party. Gen
eral Hawiey was made permanent chair
man of the gathering. The platform ad
vanced as conspicuous issues equal suf
frage and the maintenance of the public
faith. ThÂ« past policy 'of the party was
indorsed. President Johnson was severely
condemned for his acts. The nomination
of General Grant was made by General
John A. Logan. : General Grant was
unanimously nominated when the roll
was called. Schuyler Colfax was nom
inated for Vice-President. The letter of
acceptance written by General Grant will
always be famous by reason of one sen
tence it contained: "Let us have peace."
The Democratic convention met at New
York July 4, 1868, and nominated Horatio
Seymour of New York for President and
Francis P. - Blair of Missouri for Vice-
President. Governor Seymour was the
permanent president
of the convention.

in the platform which attracted more than
passing comment. The first declared
"that all obligations of the Government

ought to be naid in lawful money." .. The

had no vote. Grant had 214 electoral votes
and Seymour 80. The popular vote was as

On the i 30th of January following,

The fifteenth amendment was men
tioned by General \ Grant in his inaugural
address. He expressed the' hope that it
would be ratified and settle the question
of suffrage, The first year :of General
Grant's administration made James G.
Blame Speaker of the House. The prin
cipal interest in General Grant's first term
centered in the negotiations for a treaty
for the annexation of San Domingo, which
treaty was rejected by the Senate by a tie
vote, 28 to 28. In 1870 Virginia, Mississippi
and Texas were once more admitted to the
privileges accorded to the other States of
the South, having fulfilled all the require
ments prescribed by legislation. ; The
Legislature of Georgia having expelled
colored men from seats in the State Legis
lature, Congress enacted that before the
Senators and Representatives of Georgia
could be seated the fifteenth amendment
to the constitution must be ratified by
that State and this was done. General
Grant presided during a period of much

of Jefferson - Davis. The Democratic Na
tional Convention at 7 Baltimore, meet
ing July 9, adopted the Liberal Republican
platform, in which it was declared that
"we remember with gratitude the heroism
and sacrifices of the soldiers and sailors of
the Republic." Greeley was.also adopted

and , of all the Southern States with the
exception . of Georgia, Kentucky, Mary

The popular vote was: Grant, 3,597,070
Greeley, 2,834,079. Horace Greeley died
before the electoral college met. "All the
people," wrote Mr. Blame, "remembering
only his noble impulses, his great work for
humanity, his broad impress upon the age.
When the Forty-fourth Congress was or
ganized, March 6, 1875, the Democrats
controlled the House, as was disclosed by
the vote for Speaker, Michael C. Kerr of
Indiana receiving 173 votes and James G.
Blame 106. The Senate remained Repub
lican. The panic of 1873 stimulated the
discussion of financial : measures. Con

, Rutherford B. Hayes -became : the Presi
dential nominee of the Republican party
at . the Cincinnati convention, which was
held June, 1876. James G. Blame; was
considered the leading candidate before
the convention assembled. Other promi
nent candidates were Oliver P. Morton of
Indiana; Roscoe Conkling' of New York,
Benjamin F. Bristow of Kentucky and
John F. Hartranftof Pennsylvania. Blame
was defeated by a ":' combination V between
the followers of Morton, Conkling, i Hart-'
ranft and Hayes and a part of 'â  the Bristow
following, resulting jin the nomination of
Hayes on the seventh ballot. William A.
Wheeler of New York was nominated for
"Vice-President. The Democrats put in the
field a ticket, naming Samuel J. Tildeu of
New York for President and Thomas " H.

The Prohibitionists , and the Greenback
party had tickets also in nomination. -y

and it was arranged that the Democratic

continue; that the troops should be with

that Republicans should not be subject to
prosecutions for â .. political reasons. Pack
ard then withdrew. These events gave
rise to what was known as the "stalwart
Republicans," who. disapproved of the
President's course.
During the . Hayes administration civil
service reform became a subject of : discus
sion. General Grant had in the executive
chair created a commission by which rules
were prescribed for ; the â  examination â  of

tried to carry out , civil service reform and
issued an order directing office-holders to

The last session of .the Forty-fifth Con
gress found the Democrats in control of
both branches of Congress for the first
time since 1856, the Congress chosen
coincidently with the election of James
Buchanan. An amendment was added by
the Democrats to the army appropriation

During this administration the resump
tion of specie payments became an accom
plished fact. The restriction of Chinese
immigration began ,to y attract < the atten
tion of Congress. The first bill passed was
vetoed by President Hayes.;
The movement by. which it was planned
to nominate General Grant for a third
term as President, in 1880, attracted great
attention. General Grant had made a re
markable tour , around the world ; and his
name was - before the public constantly.
Senators Conkling, Cameron and Logan
"strongly ' favored a renomination. 7 The
struggle which took place at _ the Republi
can ; National Convention is . memorable.
It is not proposed ;to * give an account of

General Hancock carried every Southern

The quarrel between the "stalwarts"
and "half-breed" Republicans in New
York State was very bitter during the Gar
field administration. An open rupture
was caused between President Garfield
and the "stalwarts," who were led by Sen
ator Conkling, by the appointment of W.
H. Robertson to be Collector of Customs at
the port of New York. Robertson was a
"half-breed" of prominence. Senator Conk
ling and Senator Piatt resigned their seats
and proceeded to Albany to secure their
re-election as an act of vindication. In
this. they were disappointed. The politi
cal quarrel was proceeding when Guiteau,
a semi-lunatic, shot President Garfield as
he was passing to take a train to carry him
to Elberon, New Jersey. President Gar
field died from the bullet ' wound some
weeks later, and Chester. A. Arthur be
came President by succession.

flict" having been fought to its conclu
sion and the Southern States; having
been restored ' , to par ticioatiori; in the
Government of the United States, sec
tional differences had, to a large extent,
disappeared. John Sherman had brought
about a brilliant success by resuming
specie payments; the Chinese question
was tortuously progressing toward a final
settlement; "Protection to American in
dustries" was pushing to the front; ;-
The logic of events foreshadowed that
James G. Blame, who was among the most
brilliant and indefatigable exponents of
th "tariff for protection to American in
dustries," would â ; be the ' Republican
standard-bearer. '.. His acts as . Secretary of
State under Garfield added luster 7to
his . already great reputation. - He con
ceived the idea 'of 'â  a peace congress of all
independent governments yof North and
South America to meet at Washington to
agree,' if possible, upon some comprehen
sive ;. plan for averting/ war \ by y means of
arbitrating, and. for resisting the intrigues
of European diplomacy 7 as a measure
toward closer relationship with our conti
nental neighbors^ That this Congress was
not - held was .' due '{ to y causes , beyond Mr
Blame's control. He instructed Mr. Lowell'
United States Minister to' Great Britain to
apply to the British Govern -for
its y, consent, ; to the mutual . abrogation
of certain j clauses ,in the â¢ Clayton-Bulwer
treaty of 1850 ' -which in ; his oDinion con
ceded to Great Britain the = control of the
Nicaragua canal. He largely concerned
himself in throwing American safeguards
around the control of that proposed work
He devised the plan of reciprocity in com
mercial dealings with other countries, so
that a mutual benefit was insured and
an , extended foreign
trade of the United
States became a fact.
John Sherman, in
Republican
Convention of
June, 1834.
his "Forty Years in *
the House, Senate and Cabinet" wrote
that he considered Mr. Blame to be the
"natural candidate" in- 1884. He always
opposed Chinese immigration.
The Republican National Convention of
1884 assembled in Chicago June '3. The
preliminary J canvass, demonstrated his
personal popularity, which had made him
â  a formidable candidate before the conven
tions of 1876 and 1880. His principal com-
petitor for the nomination was Arthur.
On the first ballot Blame received 334%
votes; Arthur received 278, Edmnnas 93,
John A. Logan 63K, Hawleyâ, Sherman
30, Robert T. Lincoln 4, General Sherman
2. Blame gained steadily and was nomi
nated on the fourth 'ballot, receiving 539
votes. Arthur had 207 on this ballot.
Logan's friends went over in a body to
Blame on the fourth ballot, which made
the result certain. .
"His nomination," says Smalley, "was
a triumph of positive, practical statesman
ship in domestic affairs and of a courage-
ous, intelligent Americanism in the rela
tions of this country with other nations."
John A. Logan was nominated for Vice-
President on the first ballot, receiving 779
votes to 6 for.Gresham, 3 for Fairchild of
Wisconsin and .1 for Foraker. The plat-
form spoke in no uncertain tone about the
tariff. * The fourth plank was as follows:
It is the first duty of a good government to
protect the rights and promote the interests of
its own people. The largest diversity of in
dustry is the most productive of general pros
perity and of the comfort and independence
of the people. We therefore demand that the
imposition of duties on foreign imports shall
be made, not for revenue only, but that in
raising the requisite revenues for the Govern-
ment, such duty shall be so levied as to afford
security to our diversified industries and pro-
tection to the rights and wages of the laborer,
to the end that active and intelligent labor, as
well as capital, may have its just reward and
the laboring man his full share in tho National
prosperity.
The platform also favored the regulation
of railway corporations, opposed Chinese
immigration, indorsed civil service reform,
approved of the eight-hour system for
labor, and asserted that it is the duty of the
Nation to secure all rights to all citizens.
The Democratic National Convention,
which met in Chicaeo July 8, nomi
nated Grover Cleveland for . President and
Thomas A. Hendricks for Vice-President.
A part of the Democratic platform is here-
with given because the issue between the
two great parties was the tariff. The ex
tract is as follows:
Sufficient revenue to pay all the expenses of
the Federal Government, economically admin-
istered, including pensions, Interest and prin
cipal of the public debt, can be got under our
present system ot taxation from Custom-house
taxes on fewer imported articles, bearing
heaviest on articles of luxury and bearing
lightest on articles of necessity. We. there-
fore, i denounce the abuses of the existing
tariff, and, subject to the preceding limita
tions, we demand that Federal taxation shall
be exclusively for public purposes and shall
not exceed the needs ot the Government,
economically administered.
The popular vote for the candidates of
the two great parties was close. Cleveland,
who was elected, received 4,911,017, Blame
4.848,333. The plurality for Cleveland was
only 68,683. The electoral vote was: Cleve-
land 219, Blame 182. . yyy77

The Republican National Convention of
1888 met at Chicago June 19. Morris M.
Estee of California was the permanent
chairman. The chairman of the platform
committee was William McKinley of Ohio,
who was well known as the protective
tariff champion in the House of Repre
sentatives/ Blame, in his famous Florence
letter, had told his friends that he did not
wish the nomination for the . Presidency.
The names now prominently mentioned
were^Sherman, Allison, Harrison, Gresham
and Depew. The first ballot developed
votes for fourteen candidates - and three
successive ballots 'â¢" showed little change.
Depew withdrew his name. , Harrison was
nominated on the eighth ballot, receiving
544 votes to 283 cast for all other candi
dates, and his nomination was made unan
imous. Levi P. Morton of New York was
nominated for Vice-President, Once more
the party spoke decidedly for protection
as follows: â¢
We are uncompromisingly in favor of the
American system â of protection; we protest
against its destruction as proposed by the
President and his party. . They serve the inter
ests of Europe; we will support the interests
of America. , We accept the issue and con
fidently appeal to the people for their Judg
ment. The protective system must be main
tained. Its abandonment has always been
followed by general disaster . to all interests,
except those of the usurer and the Sheriff. We
denounce the Mills bill as destructive to the
general business, the labor and the farming

. Harrison was elected President, getting
233 electoral votes; Cleveland 168. The
popular vote was: Harrison, 5,440,216,

two great parties is given.
It is not necessary to recall the ' political
events of the past eight years in detail, as
the facts are known to all men. Through
out this period the Republican party has
stood stanchly for the protective tariff and
the protection of American industry.
Benjamin ";. Harrison served out â â â¢ his term
and . in i 1893 the Democrats returned to
power.* During the last two years the
tariff ; policy of the Democrats, as exempli
fied by what is known as the Wilson tariff
bill, has been in operation. The bond
issues which the administration has made
and the other expedients to keep up the
treasury reserve are familiar facts. It is
only necessary, to recapitulate the princi-
pal facts of the campaign of 1892 to bring
the record of the two parties to the present.
The Republican National Convention of
1892 met June 7at Minneapolis. William
McKinley was the permanent chairman.
In :; his opening ; speech he said: "The
platform of the first Republican National
Convention of .thirty-six years aeo reads
to-day more like inspiration than the affir
mation of ; a great -political party. Everyprovision of that great instrument is on the
public statutes of our country to-day,
which cannot be said of the platform of
any other political organization in this or
any other country." He also said: "This
contest we enter into is for the main
tenance of protection and reciprocity."
Among the speakers at the convention was
Fred Douglass.
Only one. ballot was necessary to deter- j
mine the choice of the convention for
the Presidential nomination. That bal
lot resulted as follows: Harrison 535,
McKinley 183, Blame 175, Reed 4, Lincoln
1. On motion of McKinley the nomina
tion of Harrison was made unanimous. ,
Whitelaw Reid was nominated for Vice-
President by acclamation.
The Republican National platform re
affirmed the American doctrine of pro
tection and called attention to its growth
abroad, pointed to "the success of the Re
publican policy of reciprocity, under
which our export trade has vastly in
creased, and new and enlarged markets
have been opened for the products of the
farms and workshops"; and called atten
tion to "the bitter opposition of the Demo
cratic party to this practical measure";
demanded the use of both gold and silver
as standard money; demanded freedom
of the ballot; denounced "inhuman out
rages perpetrated upon American citi
zens for political reasons in certain
Southern States of the Union"; favored
he extension of foreign commerce; con
demned trusts; commended civil service
reform; enunciated that "the construction
of the Nicaragua canal is of the highest
importance to the American people as a
measure of defense and to build up and
maintain American commerce and it
should be controlled by the American
Government."
The Democratic convention at Chicago
nominated rover Cleveland and Adlal E.
Stevenson for President and Vice-Presi
dent respectively. The Democratic plat
form embraced many provisions. "Re
publican protection" was declared to be "a
fraud," and the McKinley tariff law, en
acted by the Fifty-first Congress, was de
scribed as "the culminating atrocity of
class-legislation." The repeal of the 10
per cent tax on State bank issues was
recommended. There were many other
provisions, which are well recollected by
voters.
The popular vote was as follows: Cleve
land 5,553,142, Harrison 5,186,931, Bidwell
(Pro.) 268,361, Weaver (People's) 1,038,128.
Cleveland's plurality over Harrison was
366,211. The electoral vote was: Cleve
land 276, Harrison 145, Weaver 23.
The words of George S. Boutwell, taken
from his work entitled "Why I am a Re-
publican," may fitly find space here:
It (the Republican party) accepted power
when the industries of the country were in-
significant in volume, limited in variety and
paralyzed by the constant and rigorous war-
fare upon every measure designed to foster
labor or to add to the security of capital em-
ployed in the manufactures and trade. The
country was enslaved to the idea that agri-
culture might prosper while manufactures
were neglected.
It accepted power when the country was on
the eve of a gigantic war, and when all the
conditions and circumstances were unfavor-
able to its successful prosecution.
it has administered the Government during
a fourth part of its constitutional existence.
In that period the resources of the country
have been so developed, its industries so mul
tiplied and magnified' that the era is marked
as one of unexampled prosperity. In that
period a new geneiation of men has come
upon the stage, Who cannot, out of their own
experience, institute either contrasts or com-
parisons between the near and the more re-
mote past.
I have sought to address myself to that class
In the hope that I may enable them to see. as
in one view, the beneficial changes that have
been wrought by the Republican party in con-
stitutional law, in public policy, in the educa
tional and industrial condition of the people,
and, above all, in the sentiment of nationality,
â¢which is better security for the preservation of
the Union than can be had in statutes and con
stitutions.
The opening sentences of the seventh
Republican National platform, which was
adopted at Chicago, June 5, 1880, make
up a presentation of history of Republican
achievements which has much of historical
interest.
The Republican party, in National Conven
tion assembled, at the end of twenty years
since the Federal Government was first com-
mitted to its charge, submits to the people of
the United States this brief report of its ad-
ministration. lt suppressed a rebellion which
had armed nearly a million men to subvert
the Federal authority. It reconstructed the
Union of the States with freedom, instead of
slavery, as its cornerstone. It transformed
4,000,000 human beings from the likeness of
things to the ranks of citizens. It relieved
Congress from the infamous work of hunting
fugitive slaves and charged it to see that slav-
cry does not exiaWWSEj/i
It has raised the value of your paper cur-
rency from 38 per cent to the par value of
gold. It has restored upon a solid basis pay-
ment in coin for all the National obligations,
and has given us a currency absolutely good
and equal in every part of our extended coun-
try. It has lifted the credit of the Nation from
the point where 6 per cent bonds sold at 86 to
that where 4 per cent bonds are eagerly sought
at a premium. Under its administration rail
ways have increased from 31,000 miles in 1860
to more than 80,000 miles In 187.1.
Our foreign trade has increased from $700,
- to 150,000,000 in the same time;
and our exports, which were $ 20,000,000 less
than our imports in 1860, were ,000,000
more than our imports in 1879. Without re-
sorting to loans it has, since the war closed,
defrayed the ; ordinary expenses of Govern
ment, besides the accruing interest on the
nubile debt, and disbursed annually more
than $30,000,000 for soldiers' pensions. It has
paid $888,000,000 of the public debt, and by
refunding the balance at a lower rate of inter
est has reduced- the annual Interest charge
from nearly $151,000,000 to less than $89,
- All the industries of the country have
revived, labor is in demand and throughout
the entire country there is evidence of a com
ing prosperity greater than we have ever en-
joyed. â /-.'â '.--â 
Upon this record the Republican party asks
for 'he continued confidence and support of
the people.
This brief sketch of the. Republican
party would be incomplete without call-
ing attention to the fact that most of the
older leaders are dead. Nearly all those
who were members of the Republican Na
tional Convention of 1860 are gone, the list
including Weed, Davis, Swett, Morgan,
Wilmot, Stevens, Curtis, Andrew, Corwin,
Giddings and Cameron. The death list
also embraces all the Republicans who
have occupied the Presidency since 1852,
with the one exception of Harrison, the
Ji?t embracing Fremont,. Lincoln, Grant,
Hayes, Johnson, Garfield and Arthur. ;
7 remember, sir, once I was told that the old
Republican ship was gone; but, when I
steadied myself on the shores bounding the
political ocean of strife and commotion I
looked afar off, and there I could see a vessel
bounding the boisterous billows, with white
sails unfurled, marked [on her sides,
"Freighted with the hopes of mankind,"
while the great mariner above as her helms-
man steered her, navigated her to a haven of
rest, of peace and of safety. You have but to
look again upon that broad ocean of politi
cal commotion to-day and the time will soon
come when Vie same old craft, with the same
old cargo, will ;be seen flying the same flag,
' passing through time tempestuous waves,
Â anchoring herself .ct the sliores of honesty and
justice, and there she will lie undisturbed by
strife and tumult, again in peace and safety.â'

SWINGING OF THE
PARTY PENDULUM.
Out of Twenty-Seven Elec
tions Only a Few Were
* Forecast.
Washington the Only President
Who Received a Unani
mous Election.
-
Many Exciting Campaignsâ Not Since
1880 Has the Same Party Won in
Two Successive Battles.
The number of Presidential canvasses in
which the result could be foretold from
the beginning are surprisingly few. Out
of the twenty-seven elections on which the
choice of a President depended not more
than half a dozen were so one-sided that
the outcome could have been foreseen
from the beginning. It will be necessary,
of course, to leave the two elections of
Washington out of the list.
The only man who could be considered
at all as a possible rival was Benjamin
Franklin, and he was 83 years of age at
Washington's first election and died be-
fore half of that terra was ended. The ac- '
knowledgment of Washington's pre-emi
nence was seen in the convention of '1787,
which framed the constitution, when he
was elected by a unanimous vote to be
president of that assemblage.
Robert Morris, in behalf of his fellow
members of the Pennsylvania deputation
in the convention, proposed Washington
for this post. A footnote to Madison's
journal of that gathering shows that
Franklin, who was another of Pennsylva
nia's delegates, intended to nominate
Washington, but "the state of the weather
and of his health confined him to his
house." (Elliot's Debates," vol V, p. 123.)
In the first and second elections, as well
as in the third and fourth, every Presi
dential elector cast a ballot for two "per
sons without indicating which person he
desired to be President, writes Charles M.
Harvey in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
Under the constitutional provisions which
governed elections until 1800, and includ
ing that year, the person getting the high
est number of electoral votes, a majority
of the whole number of electors chosen,
was to be President, and the second high
est person was to Vice-President. .
The sixty -nine electors distributed their
votes among a dozen persons, but each
elector gave one of his two votes to Wash
ington. Thus Washington got sixty-nine
votes, and a unanimous poll. The man
who stood second on the roll was John
Adams, who received thirty-four votes,
and he became Vice-President. . The sec

The contested Presidential elections be

struggle has been -active . and' exciting.
Those of 1796 and *' 1800 were particularly

exciting by their contrast with the calm" of
the two preceding canvasses. Washing
ton desired to step down at the end of his
first term, but through the solicitations of
the leaders of both parties he was induced
to accept a second election.
There was no such general desire to re
elect any other man, although the opposi
tion to Jefferson " for a second , term was
feeble and the antagonism to Monroe did
not reflect itself in the election figures.
In his second election, that of 1804, Jeffer
son carried fifteen States and 'received 162
electoral votes, ed compared with two
States and 14 votes for Charles Cotesworth
Pinckney, the Federalist candidate.
The tie in the Electoral College in 1800
between Jefferson and* Burr led to the
adoption of the eleventh amendment to
the constitution, directing each elector to
indicate, on separate ballots, his choice for
President and for Vice-President, a re
quirement which has continued to the
present day.
.Madison had a fight on his hands in
both his canvasses, although It was not
very formidable in the first One, that of
1808. An element of his party in Virginia
desired Monroe's nomination instead of
Madison's, and an element in some of the'
otherJÃtates thought Virginia, through the
sixteen years of Washington and Jeffer
son, had the Presidency long enough, and
wanted to give the rest of the country a
chance. ' . V.F-.'
Then, too, Jefferson's embargo policy
was unpopular in the North, the commer
cial section. These reasons sent Massachu
setts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and
Rhode Island back to the Feder
alists in 1808, and divided Maryland
and North Carolina. Madison carried
twelve States, with 122 electoral votes, as
compared with five States and forty-seven
votes which went to Pinckney, who was
again the Federalist candidate.
Four years later, however, in 1812, the
result was in doubt until the end. De Witt
Clinton, who had belonged to Jefferson's
Republican party, and who was about a3
much of a dictator in that party in New
York as David B. Hill was a few years
ago, was nominated against Madison by a
convention of Republicans in that State.
He was Indorsed by the Federalists, and
carried seven States and eighty-nine elec
toral votes, against eleven States and 128
votes for Madison. Clinton carried New
York, but Pennsylvania was the battle
ground that year, and that State was held
by Madison.;
A period now appears in which the
name of the next President could always
be told after the Republicans or Demo
crats selected their candidate. When the
war of 1812 closed only one party was left
in the country. Opposition to that con
flict by the Federalists, and their sup
posed treasonable designs in the Hartford
convention, made them a sort of outlawed
sect throughout the country, except in
part of -New, England and in Delaware,
where they maintained their organization
until about â  1821, though tbey y lost all
influence yin 'j National â * politics. In 1816
Monroe, the Democratic candidate, car-'
ried sixteen States," â : with ;>; 183 i electoral
votes, while ; Rufus King, the Federalist,
had y only"' three j States Massachusetts,
Connecticut and Delawareâ and thirty-
four votes y *
Four years later, or in 1820, there was no
organized opposition rto i the Democrats,'
and Monroe received all the electoral votes
â¢ cast except one, which was given' tq; John
Quincy Adams, the Secretary, of State in
the Monroe Cabinet, who was not a candi
date. A New Hampshire elector, William
Plumer, unwilling that anybody y except
Washington should have ; the honor of a
unanimous election, cast the solitary vote
for Ada'mS.^^^B|H^S^^^^'^^> '
; The absence of actual organized opposi
tion to the Democratic party in National
elections after.lBl6 until 1824 has given to
that period, which covered; almost all of
Monroe's service in the Presidency, the
name of the "era of good feeling."
The political strife which in ordinary
conditions would be between two : regu
larly defined parties degenerated ;at the
close of the "era of good feeling" into '} a
wrangle between groups and factions
nominally arrayed under the same ban
ner. In 1824 there were four candidates-
John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson,
William H. Crawford and Henry Clayâ
for the Presidency, all pretending to be
Democrats or Republicans,l but shortly
after Adams' election by y the " House of
Representatives the faction to which he
and Clay belonged assumed the name of
National ; Republicans, : and that with
which Jackson and Crawford were identi-
fied soon after Jackson was elected in
1828 formally took the name Democratic,
which had been used interchangeably with
Republican for over a dozen years at that
time. .
lo 1824 and 1828 the contest was close
and exciting, for, though in the latter year
Jackson carried fifteen States with 178
electoral votes to nine States and 83 votes
for Adams, the difference in the popular
vote was not great, and the result was in
doubt along to near tbe end of the canvass.
But in 1832 and 1836 the unexpected hap
pened. Jackson's vote was 219, as com
pared with 49 for Clay, the National Re
publican candidate; 11 for Floyd, whom
South Carolina, in antagonism to Jackson
on account of the nullification trouble,
threw away its vote upon, and 7 (Ver
mont's) for Wirt, the anti-Masonic nom
inee. In 1836 the Whig opposition was
divided into four groups, with separate
tickets, headed by W. H. Harrison, H. L.
White, Daniel Webster and W. P. Man
gum, respectively, and Van Buren, the
Democratic nominee, had an easy tri
umph. "Four years inter Harrison had a
still easier victory over Van Buren in the
log cabin and bard cider campaign of 1840,
when he carried nineteen States and 234
electoral votes, as compared with seven
States and 60 votes for Buren. In
the popular vote, however, the difference
between the candidates was slight, Harri
son's total being 1,275,017 and Van Buren's
1,128,702. y " J â¢
Not till twelve years after 1840 did an
other one-sided canvass come. In 1844 and
1848 the contest . was so close that the
"third" party of the day, the Liberty in
the earlier instance and the Free Soil in
the later one, turned the scale. It: did
this in New York, which was sometimes
."pivotal" at that ef.rly day, and which, in
deed, decided the elections even earlier
than that time. The Liberty party polled
only about 16,000 votes in New York in
1844, and ; but 62,800 in the country at
large, yet those 16,000; defeated the Whigs,
destroyed the last chance of that "spoiled
child :of i destiny," r Henry Clay, ;to â¢ eve**
reach the Presidency, and sent James K.
Polk to the White House.
The Free Soil party's vote in New York
in 1848 was far larger than its more radical
predecessor, the Liberty party, polled ;in
the entire country, or 120,510, and, unlike
that of i the Liberal ; party, y was drawn
chiefly from, the Democracy, and de
feated . that organization. ; The : Free Soil
candidate was ex-President Van Buren,
and the Democratic nominee was Lewi
Cass,' who helped to beat, Van" Buren in the
Democratic convention of ; 1844, when the
latter sought his third nomination and a
second term. Thousands of Van Buren's
Democratic friends in "-' his own State, who
cared nothing * for the ; principles ; of the
Free Soil party, voted the : Free Soil ticket
to wreak revenge on Cass. They got the
revenge and gave New York and the Pres
idency to Taylor, the Whig nominee. â -.".â 
. In the canvass of 1852 there was a greater
disproportion between the strength of the
contending parties in the Electoral College
than bad been shown before since Mon
roe's time, and greater than was revealed
afterward, except in / 1864, when the
eleven seceded States, ; which, under
normal conditions, would nearly all have
sided with the minority-party^ of that
time, were cut off from the canvass. The
Democratic candidate, Franklin Pierce,'
carried twenty-seven States, as compared
with fourâ Vermont, Massachusetts, Ken
tucky and Tennesseeâ which went to Win
field Scott, the Whig nominee. Piece's
electoral vote was 254 and Scott's 42.
There was no such disparity in the popular
vote, though, tlie form being 1,601,474
and the letter's 1,386,578.
Now come two. canvasses those of 1856
and 1860â in which the contest was close
and exciting. It is often said that if Fre-
mont had carried Pennsylvania in 1856, in
addition to the other States which he won,
he ' would have been elected; but this is
not correct. If, however, he, had carried
Pennsylvania and , any of the ; lour other
Northern Statesâ New Jersey, Indiana,
Illinois and California which went to
Buchanan, he would have won. His elec
toral vote was , 114, as ' against 174 for
Buchanan. But in the popular vote the
divergence in 1856 was broader than it was
in several canvasses when the difference
in the Electoral College totals was . much
greater. In 1860, though the Republican
electoral vote was 180, against 123 for the
combined oppositionâ Douglas Democrats,
Breckinridge Democrats and Bell Consti
tutional Unionists the opposition was
I nearly 1,000.000 ahead in the popular vote.
The next three electionsâ those of 1864,
1868 and 1872â were easy victories for the
winning party. For a month or two early
in the canvass of 1864 the Republican out
look seemed dark, but Sherman's and

GREELEY NAMED THE
REPUBLICAN PAR TY.
Michigan Had the Honor of
Christening the Sturdy
Infant.
The Great Editor's Suggestion to
Unite All the Opponents of
Negro Slavery.
Its First Convention Was Held in Pitts-
t burg, at Lafayette Hall, in
the Year 1856.
The fortieth anniversary of the birth of
the Republican party, on February 22 last,
has recalled the fact that while ttie first
National Convention was held on Febru
ary 22, 1856, at Pittsburg, says the New
York Commercial Advertiser, yet the
State of i Michigan claims the honor of
giving to the new party its distinctive
name. The interesting circumstances are
given by Charles H. Moore, a student of
political data, and the statement will be
read with particular interest at this time.
It is as follows:
From its start, in 1839, the anti-slavery
party bad taken root in Michigan, and in
1844 its candidate for the Presidency,
James G. Birney, was a resident of the
Peninsular State. Mr. Birney was born
in Kentucky, where he freed his slaves in
1834, and was driven from that State for
editing an . abolition paper. In 1840 and
1844 he was the candidate of the abolition
(or liberty) party for President. In 1842
he * removed ,to Michigan, and during his
residence he became disabled for political
work by a fall from his horse. :. But for
Birney's nomination the electoral votes of
both New York and Michigan would have
been cast for Henry Clay instead of for
Polk and the brilliant Kentucician would
have; been , elected (Lalor's Cyclopedia of ,
Political - Science, article on "Abolition,"
volume 1, page 4). This blunder drove
many Abolitionists into the Free-Soil
party, and when, after the election of 1848,
it was found that the Democratic defec
tion, headed by Martin Van Buren, had
for). its object â¢ the defeat .of Cass y rather
than the advancement of anti-slavery
principles. â¢
. Many Democrats and Whigs who had
been ' drawn '. into the : new movement ' re
turned to the old parties. The Van Buren
electoral ticket in Michigan was headed by.
Mr. Littlejohn of Allegan and James F.
Joy. The former went back to the Demo
cratic.- party, the , latter to the Whig. > So,
too, Austin Blair returned to the Whig
party. (See letter from Hovey K. Clark in
Post ; an d y Tribune, ; July 6, 1879. ) Yet ;so
strong was the opposition to the extension
of slavery that \no Democrat could j have
been elected to Congress on a pro-slavery
platform. Indeed, all three Congressmen
were pronounced opponents of slavery ex
tension. yy Robert McClelland, afterward
Governor and Secretary; of the Interior in
President s Pierces y Cabinet, \ acquired the
name of "Free-Soil McClelland" by reason
of a speech in Congress;;; Charles E. Stuart,
who was sent to the Senate later, took ad
vanced ground (in the "Flowerfield Let
ters") against the * encroachments of
slavery, and Kinsley S. Bingham was so
aggressive an opponent of slavery that he
soon found himself outside his party.
Bo satisfactory was McClelland to the
Free-Soilers that they deliberately refused
to put an opposition ticket in the field
when in 1851 he first ran for Governor. At
the State election in 1852 McClelland had
a majority over Zachariah Chandler, the
Whig candidate for Governor, and Isaac
P. j Christiancy,* the Free-Soil Democratic
candidate. The overwhelming defeat of
the Whigo in 1852, however, convinced
both patriots and politicians throughout
the.country that the times were ripe for a
new party, and in . Michigan this feeling
found expression in 1853 in the organiza
tion of a political club in Grand Rapidsâ"
one whose most active member, Wilder D.
Foster, was elected Mayor by a combina
tion of Whigs and Democrats, call
ing themselves the Free Democratic
party. The new party , was fortunate in
having the energetic support of the Grand
Rapids Eagle, vigorously, edited by A. B.
Turner; and when, on the 22d of February,
1854, a State convention of Free Demo
crats nominated a full ticket, headed by
Bingham, the Eagle promptly urged the
abandonment of the Whig organization
and the support of tbe new ticket.
The action of the Free Democrats was
merely tentative, and an agreement was
entered into by the leaders to withdraw
the ticket whenever it should be found
that by so doing a fusion of Free-Soilers,
Whigs and Anti-Slavery Democrats could
be effected. . The conferences at which this
decision were reached were held at the
house of Dr.' J. A. B. Btone, president of
Kalamazoo College. The Kalamazoo con
vention of June 21, formally assented to
the withdrawal of the ticket in case the
expected fusion could be accomplished.
Events at Washington quickly paved the
way for such a combination. On May 30,
1854, the Missouri compromise was re
pealed, thereby, giving notice to the coun
try that the South was determined to push
slavery into the new territory west of the
Mississipi. It was at this most opportune
moment that Joseph Warren, the editor
and part owner of the Detroit Tribune, an
evening Whig journal, threw the powerful
influence of that newspaper into the cause
of uniting all the anti-slavery elements of
the State in a new party, which should use
the established machinery of the Whigs,
thus wiping out that party. The Detroit
Advertiser, the morning Whig organ, vio
lently opposed this programme, and bit
terly fought the new movement in its every
stage.
Carrying out the plan of action deter
mined upon, a call for a mass convention
of the opponents of 'slavery extension was
circulated throughout the State, and
within a fortnight no fewer than 10,000
signatures were obtained. The conven
tion met at Jackson on July 6, 1854. It
was a glorious day. From all parts of the
State the people came in such numbers
tbat no hall could hold them, bo the con
vention adjourned to a beautiful oak grove
that covered a tract of land known as
"Morgan's Forty," where a platform was
hastily built and draped with the Stars
and Stripes. Among the sturdy oaks,
under the free blue sky, the Republican
party was that day born.
David S. Walbridge, an old-time Whig,
was called upon to preside. A committee
on nominations, made up of eighty-eight
men, representing all the Senatorial dis
tricts, used the Free Democratic ticket as
a basis, and placing Bingham at the head
filled in the remainder of the places with
a judicious mixture of Whigs and Free-
Soilers. Thereupon tbe committee repre
senting the Free Democrats formally with
drew their party ticket and pledged sup-'
port to the new one.
Meantime the vast assemblage of men
and women were addressed by speakers
called from the crowd, and the composi
tion and spirit of the gathering is well
illustrated by the brief speech of Zachariah
Chandler.
There was great applause when Kings
ley S. Bingham's name was mentioned,
for as a pioneer farmer he represented the
class of people among whom the new
party was to take strongest root, and he
was recognized as the most available man
to head the new ticket of the new party.
Among the other speakers was Lewis
Clark, said to have been the "George Har
ris" of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," the son of a
Revolutionary soldier and a Kentucky
colored girl. He told in simple, effective
words how at the death of his father the
family was sold on the auction block, and
his talk was more powerful than any
speech.
More important than the ticket were
the nominations. The committee of twelve
was headtd by Jacob M. Howard and
among its members were Austin Blair and
Erastus Hussey^of underground
fame.. Withdrawing to a grassy knoll on
the edge of an oak-opening, the committee
went carefully over the draft of the reso
lutions already prepared .by Mr. Howard,
making few. and unimportant changes.
The resolutions truthfully began, "The
freemen of Michigan, assembled in con
vention in pursuance of a spontaneous
call, emanating from various parts of
the State," and went on to stig
matize "slavery as a great moral,
social and political evil, a relic of barbar
ism and an element of weakness. They
pledged resistance to the extension of
slavery, called for the repeal, of the Fugi
tive Slave Law, and the aboiitionof slavery
in the District of Columbia, and proposed
a general convention of free States to adopt
measures to resist slavery's encroach
ments.
The most important of the resolutions
historically is the one in which it is re
solved that "we will operate and be known
as Republicans until the contest is ended."
Here app-ared for the first time the offi
cial designation of the great party, which
was to administer the affairs of the Gov
ernment during the Civil War. â  The name
was not selected by, chance nor applied
without j; mature deliberation and large
purpose. Tbe choice came - about in this
way: ...v;.,

vocate, through the columns of the New
York Tribune, the organization of - all the
opponents of .slavery into a single party,

respondence with him in regard to * the
movement, giving advice , and counsel.
Mr. Greeley suggested to Mr. Warren the ;
name of Republican, and when Mr. How

gestion be adopted; wnich .was done. .

SOME OF THE
GREAT CONVENTIONS.
Where Many Presidents of
the Nation Have Been
Named.
REPUBLICANS FIRST MET
AT PITTSBURG.
Memorable Gathering That Dis-
cussed a Third Nomina
tion for Grant.
Recalling Some of the Brilliant Scenes
and Past bnt Not Faded Glories
of Republicanism.
The first National Convention of the
Republican party met at Pittsburg Feb
ruary 22, 1856, but no nominations were
made there. The nominating convention
met at Philadelphia June 17. Colonel
Henry S. Lane of Indiana presided.
Edward Stanwood, the author of "A His
tory of Presidential Elections," describes
the gathering which resulted in the nom
ination for the Presidency of John C. Fre
mont, "the Pathfinder," as "one of the
most spontaneous conventions ever known
in our political history." The delegates
were not, according to Stanwood, chosen
by any settled rule, nor was there much,
if any, regard paid to the number of votes
to which a State should be entitled. New
York cast 96 votes, Pennsylvania 81 and
Ohio 69. All the Northern States were
represented, as were also Delaware, Mary
land and Kentucky. "The dissolution of
the Whig party commenced by the im
position of the Southern platform on its
National Convention of 1852." wrote Horace
Greeley in bis history of the Civil War,
'.'was consummated by the eager participa
tion of most of the Southern members of
Congress in the repudiation of the Missouri
compromise and the passage of the Kan
sas-Nebraska bill."
Those of whatever party who emphati
cally condemned that repudiation and
who united on that basis to ignore past
political denominations with a view to united
action in the future, were first known simply
as "Anti-Nebraska," but gradually and almost
spontaneously assumed the designation of Re
publicans. As such they carried most of the
Free State elections of 1854, but were less
decidedly successful In those of 1855.
Among those who were present; were
Preston King of New York, the life-long
friend of Governor Morey. Here was Cas
sins M. Clay of Kentucky, a relative of the
great Senator. Here was Henry Wilson of
Massachusetts. Here was David Wilmot,
author of the "Wilmot Proviso." There
were men of varied precedents, but tbey
were animated by a common purpose
which found voice in their platform, the
more material planks oi which were the
following:
Resolved, That, with our Republican fathers,
we hold it to be a self-evident truth that all
men are endowed with the inalienable right
to life. liberty and the pursuit of happiness;
and that the primary object and ulterior de
sign of our Federal Government was to secure
these rights to all persons within its exclusive
jurisdiction; that, as our Republican fathers,
when they had abolished slavery in all our
National territory, ordained that no -person
should be deprived of life, liberty or property
without due process of law. It becomes our
duty to maintain this provision of the consti
tution against all attempts, to violate it, for
the purpose of establishing slavery in any Ter
ritory of the United States, by positive legisla
tion prohibiting its existence and extension
therein; that we deny the authority of Con
gress, of a Territorial Legislature, of any indi
vidual' or association of individuals to give
legal existence to slavery in any territory of
the United States while the present constitu
tion shall bÂ» maintained.
Resolved, That the constitution confers upon
Congress sovereign power over the Territories
of the United States for the government, and
that in the exercise of this power it is both
the right and the duty of Congress to prohibit
in the Territories those twin' relics of barbar
ismâpolygamy and slavery.
The assembling of this convention was
less heralded than those of the great
parties now. Only one ballot was taken
for the Presidential nomination, which re
sulted in the choice of John U. Fremont,
he receiving 359 votes to 196 for John Mc-
Lean of Ohio.
The two conventions of the Republican
party which, respectively, in 1860 and
1864. nominated Abraham Lincoln for the
Presidency, possess peculiar interest; the
first because Lincoln was the first success
ful National standard-bearer; the second
because it took place at a critical period of
the Civil War. The second presents more
features of dramatic interest.
John W. Forney said that it was "a
body which, almost beyond parallel, is
directly responsible to the people. Nor
has it a candidate to choose. 'Choice is
forbidden it by the previous action of the
people." Not only State conventions, but
also State Legislatures, declared that Lin
coln must be the candidate before the con
vention had assembled. New Hampshire
led off in this direction, holding the first
Republican State Convention of the year.
On the same day a parer which was circu
lated among the Union members of the
Pennsylvania Legislature was signed by
every one to whom it wast presented. This
was a request to Mr. Lincoln to accept a
second term for the Presidency. The
Union Central Committee of New York
unanimously recommended .the renomi
nation of Lincoln. A resolution was
adopted by the Legislature of Kansas
renominating the President and the
Union members of the New Jersey Legis
lature took the sums course. Connecticut,
Maryland, Minnesota, Colorado, Wiscon
sin. Indiana, Ohio and Maine successively
expressed their desire in the same direc
tion. "Nowhere," says the Nicoiay-Hay
history, "except in the State of Missouri
was the name of Mr. Lincoln mentioned
without overwhelming adhesion and even
in the Missouri Assembly the resolution
In favor of his remonination was laid upon
the table by only a majority of eight."
When the convention came together on
June 7, 1864. it bad less to do than any
other convention in American public his
tory, for tbe delegates were bound by a
peremptory mandate.
. This was a great gathering of represen
ative men. Inere were ma ny war Gov
ernors among the delegates, these being
John A. Andrew of Massachusetts,' Solo
mon Foot of Vermont, Marcus L. Ward
and William A. ; Newell of New Jersey,
William Dennison and David Tod of Ohio,
Governor Morgan of New York and Gov
ernor, Blair" of Wisconsin. Other noted
men were ',< Simon Cameron, Thaddeus
Stevens, ex-Sneaker Grow of Pennsylvania,
Lvman Tremain, Henry T. Raymond,
Daniel S. Dickinson and George .W. Mc-
Crary, the last named being from Ohio.
After the platform had been adopted
Mr. Delano of Ohio moved to proceed to
the nomination of : the Presidential candi
date. Simon Cameron moved to renom
inate Lincoln and Hamlin by acclamation,;
but upon a suggestion made by Henry T.
Raymond it was decided to proceed by
the call of States after the .preliminary'!
speeches. The speech in which Abraham
Lincoln was nominated was a .model of
brevity. It was made by B. C. Cook,

CONVENTION OF 1880.
When Roscoe Conkling Sp:ke for a
Third Term for General -
Grant.
The convention of 1880 embodied decid
edly dramatic features. : Frank Pixley. of
California assured the delegates that if
they would nominate Blame the Califor
nia delegation would go home with ban
ners flying. "Our western sea," poetically
said Mr. Pixley, "shall sound its roaring
anthems across the continent to your
eastern ocean; our pine-clad Sierras shall
nod their tassels in graceful courtesy to
the bending plumes of Maine.'V,||||||!^saS|
"I saw once a storm at sea," quoth Mr.
Frye of Maine. "In the nighttime; a
stanch old ship was fighting "its fury!
Darkness everywhere ! . The wind shriek
ing and howling through the rigging;. the
lightning flashing, the thunder 'rolling
danger threatening ail around. I saw at
the helm her pilot, in all the tempest,
calm; in all the turmoil, quiet; in all the
danger, courageous: in all the threaten
ings, peaceful; \ in all â¢ the uncertainty, -
hopeful. .Firm," steadfast," commanding,' I
saw him bring the tempest-tossed ship into
harbor, into peaceful waters, into safety !
That pilot was a hero." â  *- ;;
â  Blame, '.'the Plumed \ Knight," had not
reached the goal yet and this did not give
him the nomination. |

Thus began . the leader of the famous
"306" as he prepared to speak in j favor of
the renomination of General Grant..;.- ,>t)j
. "Never defeated, in peace. or war, his name
is the most illustrious borne by living man.-
His services attest his greatness, y and ": the
countryâ nay, the worldâ them by

greatness of things done; and- perils and.
emergencies .will search in vain in the future, j
as they have searched in vain in the past, for ;
any. one upon whom ; the ] Nation leans with
such confidence and trust" A burst of ap
plause greeted the orator at these words. y
â¢ Never having had a policy to enforce against
the will of the ; people he never betrayed a
cause or a j friend,' and the | people j will never j
desert or betray Mm.; Standing on the high
est; eminence of human distinction, modest,"
simple, firm and* self-poised, having filled all
lands witii his renown, he hns^s'een hot only
the high-born and the titled but the poor arid
lowly in the uttermost ends of the earth rise i
and uncover before him. He has studied the
needs and the defects of many systems of ; gov
ernment and he has ; returned a better Ameri
can than ever, with a wealth- of knowledge
and , experience added to j the , hard common
sense which shone so conspicuously in all the
fierce light that beat upon him during sixteenl
years the most trying, the most' portentous,
the most perilous in the Nation's history.
This' extract gives an idea of the elo
quence of that speech by the New York
Senator who led the "306" and the aspira
tions for a third ; term for General Grant.
But Senator Conkling played rarely on
the j feelings of his auditors -when he ut
tered the following words:
Having tried Grant twice and found him
faithful, we are told that we must not, even I

tification does not such a fallacy involve?
The American people exclude Jefferson Davis
from public trusts. Why? Because he i was
the arch-traitor and would-be destroyer. And j
now the same people is asked to ostracize Grant j
and not trust him t Why? why? I repeat. Be- i
cause he was the arch-preserver of his country
and ' because," not only in war,: but twice as |
civil magistrate, he gave. his highest, noblest
efforts to the RepuDlic. Is this an electioneer

There is no held iof ; human activity, re
sponsibility or j reason in which, rational be
ings object to an agent because '; he ; has |

hour to behold the Republican ) party advanc
ing, with : its j ensigns â  resplendent with illus
trious achievement, marching to certain and
lasting . victory, with its : greatest marshal at
its head. :"-"' .â â¢-â ,';?
This was also vain, for the , nomination
was 'â â  destined â â  to go i to other than "the
greatest marshal." " Much of the dramatic
interest naturally centered on Grant and!
his loyal "306" and the "Plumed
Knight" of I Maine,* but this was a remark
able convention in that it awarded its hon
ors to a delegate who sat on the floor of the
house to advocate the claims of another,
and who, when fame called him, sat â  pal
lid and reluciant, while around him waved
the banners of the convention, and: the air
resounded to the din made by the lusty
throats of all his fellow-delegates. .
y Seated in this memorable convention
were Senator Conkling. General Logan, J.
Donald Cameron, Preston B. Plumb,
; William > Pitt ? Kellogg [and ; Blanche K.
Bruce, United States Senators; '. Benjamin
Harrison; ; Eugene Haie, William P. Frye,
William ;J. Sewail, Omar D. Conger,

There were also on the roll five of General
Grant's Cabinet Ministers," namely: Bout

pont of ' New York and Cameron jof
Pennsylvania. Tuere were others of dis
tinction,-. the list of delegates including

the Republican party. ?:{Yy~: ;';
. The convention came to order at
noon, June; 2,! in the Exhibition Hall in
Chicago, the proceedings being opened, by
J. Donald Cameron; chairman' of the Re
publican National Committee, and after
this formality prayer * was offered by the
Rev. Dr. Kittredge of, Chicago. George F.
Hoar of Massachusetts was the temporary
and also the permanent chairman. In his
opening speech Mr. Hoar did not broach
the idea of the "unit rule," upon which
t'ae strength of the . Grant third-term
movement depended. â¢', Little was accom
plished on the ' first - day, the only
significant event being the filing of cre
dentials as delegates by representatives of
ten Congressional districts of Illinois, who
were named by district conventions and
who were not bound by the unit rule. The
rst victory of tin . anti-third term move-
ment was scored by. the election of Mr.
Conger as chairman of the committee on
credentials, Mr. Conger receiving 29 votes
to 11 tor Mr. Tr.icy of New York. General
Garfield was elected chairman of the com-
mittee on rules.. The. first' test of the Grant
strength afforded by a vote on a mo-
tion that the committee on rules ,be in-
structed to report,'. for which General
Sharpe of New York moved as a substitute
that the committee 'on credentials be
ordered to report. 1 The substitute was
lost â 318 ayes to 406 noes. Tuis was con-
sidered a measurably fair test of the rela
tive strength ,'of the Grant and the anti-
Grant forces. â¢' r . , '
r The unit rule. broke down first in the
case of ; Alabama. y The i full -vote ' of that
State was announced :. for the; substitute
motion just mentioned. A delegate pro-
tested that he desired to vot- against the
substitute, and the chairman of tbe conven
tion ordered that . the vote be so recorded.
On the. second day. of the convention
there was some sharp fencing on the point
whether the committee on rules should be
instructed to report prior ,to the report of
the T committee"; on 'c credentials, y General
Garfield, who was tacitly 'acknowledged
to be the anti-Grant leader, made a state-,
ment .that,' acting under instructions of
, his "committee, he would not report until
the committee on credentials had come in.
General Sharpe of New 'York â  wished to
get at the rules first, but this tactical move
came to naught. *./ v. ::y .
Soon after the opening of the third day
Senator - Conkling ;â¢ offered ' the . following
resolution : *';."..'
* Resolved,. '"As"; the ' sense :. of this convention
that every member of it is bound in honor to
support its. nominee, whoever "that man may
be, and that no man shall hold a seat here who
is not ready to so agree. 'â¢'.* - ; : ' y
Three delegates voted no. The call ; of
the roll of States had been demanded by
Conkling on this resolution, ''that we may
know who it is in a Republican conven
tion that votes no on such a pledge." The
three dissenting votes all came from West
Virginia. ft The most prominent of * those
who voted "no" was Mr. Campbell, editor
of the Wheeling Intelligencer. ,
The final overthrow of. the unit rule, was
reached when the convention urged that
the rules be so amended so that "the Na
tional Committee shall . prescribe . the
method or methods for the election of dele
gates to the \ convention of 1884, provided
that nothing : in the method , or rules ] so
prescribed shall be construed ?to prevent
the several | districts in the United States
from selecting their own delegates' to the
National Convention." The rules as re
ported ' were , also adopted. . The platform
having been reported and adopted by the
convention â¢ the work ' of â  nominating the
candidates was finally reached. ' Some ex
tracts from the speech of Senator Conkling
have been given. Mr. Toy of Michigan
nominated Blame, the seconding | speech
being made by ;; Mr. Pixley of . California.
John Sherman was nominated by General
Garfield. j Senator Edmunds- was "named
by. Frederick Billings of -Vermont. ., Elibu
B. . Washburn was : presented * by Mr. Cas
saday of Wisconsin, and William Windom
by Mr. Drake of Minnesota. *
These speeches were' made ]'. Saturday
evening. They provoked so much demon
stration that a threat was made to clear
the gallery of tbe noisy spectators.
Upon the ,J succeeding s Monday the | con-
vention proceeded to;.balloting.-ITwenty
seven ballots were taken. The Grant dele
gates, the '-solid 306, "j wore badges bear
ing the name of their candidate, and from
first to last they never forsook him. , They.
could have controlled ';, the nomination if
they had seen fit to drop -their candidate
and take up a new.man, but they stuck to
Grant with absolute - fidelity. . Garfield's
name first appeared, on -the second ballot,'
when he had two votes." These two votes
appeared in most of the subsequent ballot-
ing. . At the end of one day â of hard work
the candidates continued I to occupy
about A tne y same relative \ positions
as at the beginning. The Blame and Sher
man men appeared to. be equally devoted
toy their leaders. The * result ?of . the first
ballot is given in detail as follows: Grant
304. Blame 284, Sherman 93, Edmunds 34.
Washburn 30, Windom VIO.V. The Grant
vote was as follows: Alabama 13, "Arkansas

solidly for Grant were those of Arkansas,
Colorado, --> Florida and ' Kentucky. , The
New York . delegation 'y gave y- 17 votes _; to
Blame and 2to Sherman. Pennsylvania
voted Grant 32, Blame 23, Sherman 3.
Illinois voted Grant 24, Blame 10, Wash
burn 8.;. Conkling demanded and secured
the rollcall when New York was reached.
The balloting was resumed Tuesday morn
ing. On the twenty-ninth ballot Massachu
setts, transferred the majority of, its votes
to Sherman. On the thirtieth ballot Sher
man advanced to 120 and Windom fell to 4.
The next three ballots were substantially
lhe same. On the thirty-fourth ballot
Wisconsin cast 16 votes for General Gar
field. The result was thus foreshadowed.
Then came the climax of the convention.
Indiana, on the thirty-fifth ' ballot.' follow
ing Wisconsin, cast 27 votes for Garfield
and scattering votes carried his aggregate
to 50. ., â  f â 
\ When the thirty-sixth ballot opened
Blame and Sherman delegates changeu to
Garfield. . Around his head were waved
the banners of the States, which had been
seized by the delegates. There was a time
of the wildest excitement. On this ballot
General Grant's "306" voted solidly. The
result *of the ballot was: Garfield 399,
Grant 306. Blame 42, Washburn 5, Sher
man 3.
Up rose . Conkling, the leader of the 306.
and in a 1 husky voice, said: "James ,A.
Garfield of Ohio having received a ma
jority of ' all the votes cast I rise to move
that he be unanimously presented as the
nominee of this convention. I was in the
act to say that I trust the zeal, the fervor
and now the unanimity seen in this great
assemblage will be transplanted to the
field of â  the final ; conflict; and that all of
us who have borne the banner against
each other will be found with equal zeal
carrying the banner; with equal zeal
carrying the lance of the Republican party
into the ranks of the enemy."
Chester A. Arthur was nominated for
Vice-President on the first ballot
CONVENTION OF 1884
The Victory of the Plumed Knight at
:; Chicago â Speech of George
William Curtis.
; Few readers .. * can j have forgotten , the
speech made by 'Colonel Ingersoll in 1876
when he presented the name of James G.
Blame to a National .Republican Conven
tion in , connection with the Presidency.
."Leader of ; the leaders" and "the Plumed
â¢ Knight" were among the epithets applied
to Blame by Ingersoll. -
v The ; convention yy which y selected ; him
finally as the National champion was held
in Chicago June 3, 1884. y Blame had been
wholly out of public life since his retire
ment from Cabinet, a; short time after
the death of President: Garfield. This had
prevented j him from appearing in his old,
conspicuous .. position .- as > a party , leader.
i On the first ballot Blame had 334% votes.
The third 'Candidate ; in point of , initial
strength was Senator ; Edmunds of Ver
mont, ; who /commanded - 93 * votes at , the
start, his delegates being principally from
Massachusetts, Vermont and New York.
General Logan was .trie candidate of Illi
nois and had enough outside > votes to give
him a total of 63% on the first ballot.
FSe'nator-'Hawkes of Connecticu:, Senator
Sherman of i Ohio,, Robert T. Lincoln arid
General W. T. Sherman % were also voted
for. The only one of ; the list who held no
official position at the time of holding this
convention was Blame. His -rivals em
braced brie' President, four United States
Senators, a Cabinet Minister and a retired
general. â¢
Early in the convention a resolution
similar to one : that had ; been introduced
by Senator Conkling |in the convention of
1880 was urged on the opponents of Blame.
This. set forth that every delegate who
took part in the convention '.'was bound in
honor to support the candidate of the con
vention." George William Curtis led the
protest against this and said: "A Repub
lican and a free man 1 came to this con
vention, and by the grace of God a
Republican . and a free man I will go."
The resolution was withdrawn.
For the first time in a National Conven
tion a colored man was proposed for tem
porary chairmanâ Senator Lynch of Mis
sissippi, whose nomination was seconded
by George William Curtis and Theodore
Roosevelt he was elected as such of
ficer, over Powell Clayton of Arkansas,
who was recommended for temporary
chairman by the .. National : Committee.
Thus, before a ballot had been reached
Blame had met with two slight reverses.
However, Blame's star was clearly in tbe
ascendant. To defeat his nomination all
his opponents needed to unite upon
Arthur. The Arthur men pleaded with
Curtis, Lodge and Roosevelt, who did
their best against Blame, to turn from
Edmunds to Arthur. ''Clinging to Ed
munds you will surely nominate Blame,"
they said. They tried to bring out Robert
T. Lincoln, but all in vain. At each ballot
Blame gained, while Arthur lost
Hawiey gained two votes on the fourth
ballot Lincoln jumped from four to
eight on the third, but sank to two on . the
fourth. There was "noted a curious ten
dency in the knees of some of the Ed
munds men, particularly those from
Massachusetts, to knock together audibly
whenever the name of Blame was men
tioned in their hearing," and they, little
by little, deserted their favorite. Under
the management of Powell Clayton,
Arkansas started a bolt of Southern dele
gates away from Arthur. Assure! that he
himself could not win, Logan turned over
to Blame his Illinois delegation. Upon
the fourth ballot "the Plumed Knight"
was nominated. As soon as President
Arthur was notified of the result he tele
graphed his congratulations to Mr. Blame.
WHERE THEY WERE HELD.
Chicago Built the First Convention
Hall for the Nomination
of Lincoln.
Chicago inaugurated the idea that Na
tional Convention halls should be built to
bold the multitude back in May, 1860,
when it constructed the immense wooden
wigwam made famous by the first nom
ination of Abraham Lincoln.
The Democratic convention of 1856,
which nominated Pierce and King, was
held in Cincinnati, the first one in the
West-;yy'y--* YrY
The Charleston convention of 1860 was
held in a hall that would seat only 1500
people, and the three Baltimore conven
tions of the same year were held, one (the
Douglas) in a theater, the Bell-Everett in
a church and the Breckinridge in a hall
with a capacity of not more than 2000. But
halls of that size will not answer now, for
there are almost 2000 delegates and repre
sentatives of the press who have business
to transact in the convention building, to
say nothing of the throngs of outsiders
who think it their duty to see personally
to the naming of the Presidential candi-
dates and ; the framing of - the platform
principles upon which they shall stand.
New York has had but one National
Convention of either of the great political
parties, the Democratic, of 1868, which
nominated Seymour and Blair, and that
was held in Tammany Hall. Even then,
an effort was made to stampede the con-
vention for Pendleton of New York, and
both parties have been wary of New York
ever since. .
Baltimore, in the early days of the
present great parties, was the great politi
cal convention city. It had the convention
that nominated Van Buren and Johnson,
and the next four that succeeded in the
Democratic party, that of 1840, when Van
Buren was nominated the second time,
and without a Vice-President; that of 1844,
which named Polk and Dallas ; 1848, which
named Lewis Cass and Butler, and 1852,
which named Pierce and . King. Those
conventions. were easily accommodated in
ordinary sized halls, for the crowds that
attended them were as nothing compared
to the throngs that flow into convention
cities nowadays. . .
j The National Union Convention of 1868
which nominated General Grant for Presi-
dent was held in Crosby's Opera-house in
Chicago, beginning May 20, The scene rep-
resents the time of tbe announcement of
General Grant as a candidate, May 21.
The Republican National Convention of
1872 was held in , the Academy of ' Music,
Philadelphia. The convention is pictured
as it appeared when the en airman an-
nounced the nomination of General Grant
The Republican National Convention of
1876 was held in Exposition Hall, Cincin
nati, and began June 14. The hall was a
parallelogram a block in length and a quar
ter of a block wide. It accommodated over
5000 persons who were present the second
day. ;-, The chairman has just announced
the nomination of Governor Rutherford B.
Hayes of Ohio for President.
The Republican National Convention of
1880, which nominated James A. Garfield,
was held :in the . Exposition building in
Chicago, being organized June 2.
The Republican National Convention of
1884. .which nominated James G. Blame
for President, was held in Chicago in the
Exposition building, opening June 3.
The convention of 1888, by which Ben
jamin Harrison was made the Republican
standard-bearer, was held in â¢ the , Audi
torium building, Chicago. The view rep
resents the convention in session. This
was, at the time unfinished. There were
no windows, and the ball was illuminated
by electric lights. It was covered during
the convention with a temporary roofing,
and floors and galleries of pine were built
for the : occasion. The seating capacity
was 7000.
-â â 'â¢'.The Republican Convention of 1892,
which nominated Benjamin Harrison,
was held in Minneapolis. The ': conven
tion auditorium was constructed within
an;' industrial exposition building. The
seating â  capacity â ; could easily have . been
made 20,000, but was limited to 11,000 for
prudential ' reasons. The delegates were
seated on the main" floor directly under a
hu-*;e, skylight.' Minneapolis expended
about $90,000 to care for. the convention.

A Forceful Character of
Sterling and Brilliant
Qualities.
HIS LIFE BEGAN IN AN
HUMBLE WAY.
Entered the War as a Private
and Came Out as a
Major.
The Champion of Protection to Ameri-
can Labor Strong in Debate*
and Eloquent.
As the strong, unswerving leader and
champion of the cause of protection to
/American industries and American homes,
j William McKinleyâ ex-Congressman of the
United States, ex-Governor of Ohio, and
father of the celebrated tariff measure
which bears his name in its titleâ needs no
introduction to the American people. Truly
has it been said of him that his life has
been typical of all that is best in the self-
made American, his career one that affords
stimulus and inspiration to the youthful
brain and sinew of our country.
Essentially a man of the people, Mckin
ley rise from a lad, born in an Ohio vil
lage, to the position of one of the fore
* most statesmen of the times, is full of in
terest to the American public. Still in the
prime of a vigorous and developing man
hood, McKinley presents alike to young
and old the possibilities of our free insti
tutions, when supplemented by patriot
ism, integrity, courage, perseverance and
unbounded faith in the economic policies
which best promote the welfare of our
common country. His story, as his bio
grapher, Robert P. Porter, says, is that of
a serious and earnest lifeâ life of devo
tion to duty, to principle and to the pub
lic service. Aided by nothing save an
honorable parentage, a good constitution,
a quick perception, a courteous bearing, a
brave heart and a high sense of honor,
this youth in teens was mustered into the
' army and began the conflict of life on the
Nation's battlefields â conflict continued
in the . halls of National legislation, and
closely interwoven with the last twenty
â¢ five years of National progress.
No better incentive to ambition in the
American youth, no matter how humble
his origin, can be found in the lives of the
public men of to-day than in that of Wil
liam McKinley. He is of Scotch-Irish
descent. As to his ancestry, James Mc-
Kinley, an emigrant 'from the north of
Ireland, who at the age of 12 years crossed
the Atlantic with his relatives in a small
sailing-vessel at the beginning of the last
century, was the father of David McKin-
ley, the great-grandfather of William Me
' Kinley. David McKinley, as shown by
records in the Pension Bureau, re-enlisted
seven times in the War of the Revolution;
' hence McKinley comes from good righting â¢
stock. ! V **.*"
William McKinley was born January
29, 1843, in the little Ohio city of Niles,
' where ' his father, William McKinley Sr.,
was at the time managing an iron furnace.
The McKinleys inherited not only fighting
qualities DUt the skill of iron manufactur-
ing from their revolutionary ancestors.
The father took naturally to this occupa
tion and followed it until 1876, *rhen he
retired. This was his ' business in the
early part of the century at New Lisbon.
In 1829 he established an iron foundry at
Fairfield, Columbiana County, Ohio. For
twenty years William McKinley Sr. was
interested in iron furnaces at New Wil
* mington. Ohio. From Niles he moved to
Poland because of the educational ad-
vantages of Poland Academy. Shortly
after he was associated with 8. O. Edison,
uncle of Thomas Edison, to construct
- iron furnaces at Black River, now Lorain.
In 1869 he moved to Canton with his fam
ily, Intending to retire,' but he enjoyed
and managed iron interests at Caseyille,
near Saginaw, Mich., up to 1876, when he
retired.- He kept track of bis business
with exactness up to within three weeks
of his death, which took place November
â¢24, 1892. . - -yt'-y '
William McKinley Sr. was a man of
character and of the highest integrity.
His habits were frugal ' and regular. He
was a hard and constant worker. While
at times it was a struggle to provide for
such a large family (nine children) he
conscientiously performed what he be
lieved was his duty and made every pos
sible sacrifice to educate and make useful
men and women of his children. In all
: this he was more than seconded by his
noble wife, McKinley's mother, whose
' maiden name was Nancy Campbell Alli
son. Mrs. McKinley was one of those
rare women who are destined to shine in
all sorts of good and useful work, whether
in pioneer life or amid the comforts of our
modern homes. McKinley owes much to
tbis good mother. All the children were
instilled with sound Christian ideas of life
and with a patriotism and love for their
country which made no sacrifice for it too
much. Moreover, the mother was an in
tellectual force, and encouraged boys and
girls alike in their studies, and was ever
ready to surrender her own personal com
fort that they might-equip themselves as
thoroughly as possible for the battle of
life. V
Here we have a strong force in the devel
opment of the young man's character.
Many of the wholesome traits which in
after years endeared the soldier and states
man to comrades and fellow-countrymen
may be traced to the early teachings of
the mother, who lives to feel proud and
â¢happy over her son's achievements. That
her son should have won fame is undoubt
edly a source of gratification and pride to
the mother, but her real happiness comes
from the fact that be is a man of : honor
and integrity. To this y plain, sweet,
simple pioneer mother, who has experi
enced much of the hardships and struggles
of early Western life, with a large family
and limited means, the fact remains that
her- son William is a man of high prin
ciples and patriotic instincts, and, has
never ceased to ' love and cherish her. and
is a greater comfort than the fact that hey
may some day occupy the White House.
The Allisons originally came from. Eng-
land and settled in Virginia, but that
branch of ; the family from which McKin
ley is descended emigrated from Virginia
to Green County, Pennsylvania, and there'
was born Abner - Allison, the grandfather
of McKinley. Abner Allison married in
1798 Ann Campbell, who came of a Scotch-
German family. Early in the present cen
tury this couple, then having several chil
dren, left Pennsylvania for Ohio, making
the , journey by means of â¢ horses, Mrs.
Allison riding the entire distance on horse
back, holding in front of her their young
est child..
The Allisons settled on a farm some j
eight miles above New Lisbon, Ohio, and '
there, in the year of 1809, was born their
sixth â  child, Nancy, who became the
mother of McKinley. Later the Allisons
left the farm and removed to New Lisbon,
where several other children were born to
them, making in all a family of ten chil
drenâfive sons and five daughters.
The girlhood of Jf ancy Allison was
passed quietly on her father's farm and in
the peaceful little town of New Lisbon.
In the year 1827 she was married to Wil
liam McKinley Sr. and afterward the
young couple went to Fairfield, Ohio.
At 87 Mrs. McKinley is . able to travel
and take a lively interest in current events.'
A close friend of the subject of this sketch
says: i^StWi
Many of McKinley's good qualities, both of
heart tfnd mind, were due to bis mother. I re
call her quiet dignity of manner. She was
just the same in the midst of commonplace du
ties as in a palace if she had been reigning
there. All her old friends and neighbors of
Poland who speak of her agree to this.
Her character, lor all that is com
mendable in a woman's sphere, stands
pre-eminent here -in church and in
the hearts of her friends â she had
that blending of sweetness and strength of
will and purpose that has been a rich inher
itance to her children. You cannot find in all
Poland any unkind criticism or even a shadow
of a thought derogatory to McKinley and his
family. His oldest and nearest friends in
youth appreciate his characteristics and speak
of him with the same unstinted praise as
those who have known him of recent years.
This is certainly the best testimony coming
from those that had no emoluments of office
or gain of place or position to influence them
in those days, when there was nothing to gain
or lose thereby.
McKinley's mother and his entire family
seem to have made an indelible impres
sion upon the ltttle village of Poland,
which is really refreshing to those who
have studied the man in the larger affairs
of life.' Even the old Postmaster, whose
name was Case, and . who, appointed by
Buchanan, still adheres to his Democratic
principles, is willing to give*iiia: young as
sistant a' good character for industry,
faithfulness and conscientiousness in the
discharge of his duties. McKinley worked
in the postoflice the year preceding the
breaking out of the Rebellion. In fact, he
was assisting Mr. Case in Poland when he
enlisted in the army. Case is proud of the
reputation his young: clerk has made for
himself, but his affection has \ not been
strong enough to induce him to give up
his Democratic fallacies. â¢ Â;â/-* r*-
McKinley's boyhood life really began at
Poland. This quaint : village has hardly
changed at all since McKinley, as a boy,
clerked in "that center of i politics and
gossip, the rickety old postoffice,f' and
attended the Poland Academy. Life at
Poland until the war broke oat was far
from exciting. Youths like McKinley
were obliged to study hard, and not in-
frequently do odd jobs to help earn money
for books and tuition. As they advanced
into professions, it was often necessary to
teach school, clerk in a store, work on a
farm, or take up some other occupation
during vacation. The McKinley family
never hesitated to do this, and as
a result all were equipped with good
educations, two of his sisters became
excellent teachers, and he himself taught
one term of winter school in what was
then called the Kerr district. The school-
house still stands. It is about two and a
half miles by road southwest of Poland, !
but young McKinley usually strode man,:' j
fully "across lots" to shorten the distance, j
Many who live in Poland still remember'
seeing the young schoolmaster climbing
fences and making his way over the roll- !
ing surface of the country to and from his I
duties. He was thus able to assist in de-
fraying . the expenses of his tuition and
that of other members of the family at
tha academy. .-;.'....
This sort of life, while it developed and !
sharpened the intellect, has a tendency to
shorten the period between boyhood and \
young manhood. McKinley, so those who !
remember him as a boy in Poland declare, j
was a real boy, full of fun, loving athletic !
sports, fond of horses, hunting and fishing, j
and all out-door exercises, and yet at 16 j
we find him taking upon himself a serious
view of life. Before he was 18 he had en- !
listed in the ranks of war. *. . V- -
He joined the Twenty-third Ohio Regi
ment, which was officered by. three men
whose after prominence made this com
mand one of the most noted in the .war.
The first colonel was W. S. Rosecrans,
afterward General Rosicrans, a captain
whose renown is now worldwide, and
whose services later in the War of the Re
bellion were important* in its suppression.
The -first lieutenant-colonel was Stanley
Matthews, afterward Senator from Ohio

man. His entrance into Masonry was an i
incident of the war and rather unique.
â McKinley was going through a â¢hospital
with one of the regimental surgeons. He

McKinley has been!: During his campaigns
he frequently visited Canton,' always being
the guest of the McKinley ; house. . The
affectionate regard of * these men for each
other was very marked. y â¢â¢
"It was particularly felicitous for Major
McKinley that his first "four years in Con
gress were coincident with the administra
tion of President Hayes. The youngest
member of Congress, he had the intimate
and near friendship of the ruler of the Na
tion. Of course ho direct political advance
ment could or did grow out of this friend
ship. Those were questions that had to be
adjudged by the jury that composed his
Congressional ' district. That he was
chosen as their standard-bearer for seven
successive campaigns was due and could
be due to himself alone.
; Nevertheless the friendship of the Presi
dent toward the young Congressman was
an I aid to his % quick prestige with the
prominent leaders in Congress such as
rarely falls to the lot of a new man. Gar
field and Blame, Hamlin and Logan, Gen
eral and Senator Sherman,. Windom and
Burrows, and many others of equal note
visited . Canton, Ohio, time and again as
the guests of : McKinley. They, took no
pains to disguise their partiality for him,
expressed in terms that indicated a strong
belief in his future as a powerful exponent
and defender of. the civic methods which
he and they had espoused. As a matter of
.fact he had lost no opportunity to impress
Congress and the country with the econ
omic views with â: which his youth had
been imbued, and which his later studies
had precipitated in the form of absolute
conviction.
McKinley was married to. Miss Ida Sax
ton, daughter of John "Saxton, an Ohio
journalist of note, on January 25, 1871.
Two children were born to them, both
girls, .but they died early in life. For
years Mrs. McKinley has been an invalid.
In her gentle heroism she never allows
her health to interfere with her husband's
career. â¢ , -
In regard ,to Governor McKinley's do-
. . Â«** â â â â â â â 
mestic life, perhaps the most pathetic
thing to be said is that there has been so
little of it. On January 25, 1896, Governor
McKinley , and - his wife celebrated their
silver wedding in the same modest house
in Canton in which a quarter of a century
before they began life together.
The part played by McKinley in the
Chicago . convention of 1884, which nomi
nated James G. Blame for President, is
most notable. He was pledged to the
Plumed Knight. ;
M cKinley bore himself modestly at that
convention, but his great quality of leader
ship came to the front by force of circum
stances. He only spoke two or three
times from, the floor of the convention,
but every time he. arose , he attracted at
tention, and the influence he exerted was
most remarkable. At the critical i time
during the convention his was the voice
that rallied the Blame forces. Three
ballots had been taken. Blame gained
on each ballot. ' The final and des
perate effort was . made by the
other candidates under the leadership of
the dashing Foraker in Sherman's behalf
for an . adjournment. Curtis, the great
editor of Harper's Weekly, and Theodore
Roosevelt were on chairs, frantically yell
ing. Stewart of Pennsylvania and Carr of
California, in their zeal for Blame, were
â  trying to outdo Curtis and Roosevelt in
voice. The massive and phlegmatic
Dutcher of New York, one of Arthur's
generals, was, thundering away in the
effort to catch the ear and eye of the chair
man of the convention, General Hender
son of Missouri. There -ft as pandemonium
and there threatened to be a panic
In the midst of the storm McKinley
arose. Although of medium stature his
form seemed to tower above those around
him. His face was pale and looked like a
piece of marble statuary, except that his
eyes fairly blazed. Before he had uttered
two words his voice could be heard. He
waved his hand and the tumult ceased.
No mistake about itâ was the master-'
spirit of that convention. Calm and like
granite he stood. His short speech was
carried in clarion tones ail over the im
mense hall. As a friend .of Blame, he
said, he recognized â  and respected the
rights of friends of other candidates to se
cure an adjournment, and then he said:
"Let the motion be put and let everybody
favorable to the nomination of Blame vote
against it."
That settled ; it. Under McKinley's
leadership, assumed spontaneously and
boldly, the Blame men accepted the chal
lenge, the motion for fan adjournment was
voted down and the .victory was won. ylt
was not defeat that McKinley turned aside
âthe situation was not so serious as that
but in a crisis where the â¢ Blame men were
getting demoralized and the convention
was turning itself into V mob, McKinley,
leaping :to the front, by one command
marshaled the Blame; men into. line; and
pressed them forward to their already
sighted victoryffiMÃHHpl
Y; McKinley is an adroit , debater. ' The
Congressional Record does not show that
he was ever worsted in a passage of arms
with the most brilliant 'of his ; colleagues.
,In the earlier years in the House of Rep
resentatives s he ; was cautious, and 'â ;. only
undertook debate on questions with which
he was thoroughly familiar. Unlike most
new members, McKinley did not rush
madly into the wordy arena. ': Y~Y ~YI
y- He listened, weighed well the strength of
his â  antagonists : and said little until his
time and opportunity came. y For this rea
son, when McKinley arose *to speak, he
invariably commanded ':. the attention/ of
the House. ; He was generally regarded as
one cf . the mem "who had something
to say, who said it well, and when he had
said it ; stopped. y It was 'also ; discovered
that ; McKinley was quick in debate, and
that, "though his speech upon such occa
sions might be termed the essence of
courtesy, it usually V made the gentleman
who had interrupted wish he had let Mc-
Kinley alone. . J^B^SpVBQBBS
A remarkable episode in his. Congres
sional career was the following:
. Samuel J. Randall of Pennsylvania was
Sneaker when McKinley entered Congress
and they became warm friends. There
was one memorable scene in the Fiftieth
Congress, in which both figured. It oc
curred on May 18, 1888, the day on which
the general debate closed on the . Mills
bill. ; Randall opposed this measure and
incurred the displeasure of the rampant
free-trade element headed by Mills of
Texas. He took the floor to speak against
the bill. In ieeble health, his voice at
times almost inaudible, the great leader
labored under serious disadvantages
in this, * his first fight for â¢ pro
tection. Before he was through his
time expired amid cries of "Go on!"
Mr. Randall asked for an extension, but
Mills, with a discourtesy almost incred
ible, walked to the front and said: "I ob
ject!" The cry was repeated by nearly
fifty Democratic members.
It was a sad sight to witness this great
Democratic leader thus silenced upon a
momentous question by his own party
friends. There was an exciting scene.
Members and spectators, for the galleries
were crowded, joined in making the tu
mult. Amid it all the chairman, an
nounced that McKinley of Ohio had the
floor. The latter was to close the debate
on the Republican side. His desk was
piled with memoranda and statistics.
"Mr. Speaker," he cried, and his voice
stilled the din about him, "I yield to the
gentleman from - Pennsylvania, out of my
time, all that he may need in which to fin
ish his speech on this bill."
Cheer after cheer arose from the House
and galleries, and by the courtesy of the
Republican leader the once leader of the
Democracy was enabled to finish his speech
in a body over which he had thrice pre
sided as Speaker.
As a public speaker McKinley stands in
the front rank. Even those who say that
he can make only one speech must admit
that he can make that one welL But such
a criticism is not fairly taken. The truth
is that few men in political life have de
livered speeches upon such a variety of
subjects as has McKinley.
In his specialty, the tariff, he stands the
undisputed master. His attractiveness in
the presentation of this question is only
equaled by the consistency and tenacity
of bis views thereon.
McKinley's strength as a speaker upon
the tariff seems to be â first, his evident
sincerity, and secondly, his simplicity in
the presentation of his argument. ' There
is very little of the ornate in his style, but
still It is graceful. It is eminently epi
grammatic, yet not mosaic; for the sen
tences are not only well rounded, but are
well connected and forcefully arranged, so
that the climax stands upon a broad and
firm foundation of argument and fact.
Not only has he a splendid voice, but his
pronunciation is charming.
McKinley's tariff speeches in Congress
began with his speech on the Wood tariff
bill, delivered in the House of Representa
tives April 15, 1878, and closed with his
speech in favor of the tariff bill of 1890,
which, as chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee, McKinley reported to
the House, and which was . subsequently
passed, and is known throughout the
world as the McKinley tariff cf 1890. He
fought nobly against the Morrison hori
zontal bill in 1884, and led the opposition
to the Mills attack on our industries in
1888. Some people contend that McKln-^
ley's speech on* . the Mills tariff bill, May
18, 1888, was one of the ablest, if not the
ablest, ever made in defense of the policy
of protection. Here is an extract:
What Is a protective tariff ? It Is a tariff
upon foreign Imports so adjusted as to secure
the necessary revenue, and judiciously im
posed upon those foreign products the like of
which are produced at home, or the like of
which we are capable of producing at home.
It imposes the duty upon the competing
foreign product; lt makes it bear the burden
or duty, and, as far as possibleâ only
exceptedâ permits the non-competing foreign
product to come in free of duty. Articles' of
common use, comfort and necessity, which we
cannot produce here, it sends to the people un
taxed and free from Custom-house exactions.
Tea, coffee, spices and drugs are such articles,
and under our system are upon the free list. It
says to our foreign competitor : If you want to
bring your merchandise here, your farm pro
ducts here, your coal and iron . ore,
your wool, your salt, your pottery, your
glass, your : cottons and woolens, and sell
alongside of our producers in our markets, we
will make your product bear a dutyâ in effect,
nay for the privilege of doing it. Our kind of
tariff makes ! : the competing foreign article
carry the burden, draw the load, supply tho
revenue; and in performing this essential
office it encourages at the same time our own
industries and protects our own people in
their chosen employments. That is the
mission' and purpose of a protective tariff.
That is what we mean to maintain, and any
measure which will destroy it we shall firmly
resist; and* if beaten on this floor, we
will appeal from your decision to the people,
before whom parties and policies must at last
be tried. We have free trade among ourselves
throughout thirty-eight States and the Terri
tories, and among sixty millions of people.
Absolute freedom of exchange within our own
borders and among our own citizens, is the
law of tho Republic. Reasonable taxation and
restraint upon those without is a dictate of
enlightened patriotism and the doctrine of the
Republican party.
y' Free foreign trade admits the foreigner to
equal privileges with our own citizens. It in
vites the product of foreign cheap labor to this
market 'in competition with the domestic '
product, representing higher and better paid
labor. It results in giving our money, our
manufactures and our markets to other na
tions, to the injury of our labor, our trades
people and our farmers. Protection keeps
money, markets and manufactures at home for
the benefit of our own people. "",
y Taxation upon a foreign competing product
is more easily paid and less burdensome than
taxation upon the non-competing product In
the latter it is always added to the foreign
cost, and : therefore paid ,by the consumer;
while in the former, where the duty is upon
the competing product," it is largely . paid in
the form of diminished profits to the foreign
producer. It would be burdensome beyond
endurance to collect our taxes from the prod
.- ucts, professions and labor of our own people.
McKinley's closing speech on the pro
tective - tariff of 1890 reads almost like a
prophesy in the light of the disastrous
events that followed the Democratic vic
tory of 1892. Listen to these words: y
y To retain â¢ our own market under the , Demo-
cratic system of raising revenue, by removing
all protection, would require our producers to
' sell at |as low a price! and : upon .as favorable \
: terms as our foreign competitors. , How could
that be done? In one way onlyâ by producing as
cheaply as those who would seek our markets.
What would that entail? An entire revolu
tion in the -methods and conduct of business
here, a leveling down through every i chan
nel y; to s, the j lowest Z line iof our â  competi-
\ tors, ' our habits of ! living would have to be
changed, our -wages cut down 50 per cent or
more, our comfortable homes exchanged for
hovels; our independence yielded up, our citi
zenship'; demoralized. y These are ' conditions
inseparable to .V free", trade; "â 'â .. these would - be
necessary it we would command our own mar
ket among our own people ;"; and if we would
.invade \ the 'world's 'markets harsher condi
tions and- greater o sacrifices!" would - be de
manded of the masses. ; Talk about depres
sion âwe would then y have it .:.' in its
fullness. We ; would y revel Â»in unrestrained
trade. Everything would - Indeed be cheap,
but how costly when measured by the degra
dation which would ensue! When merchan

toryâ have been when everything was the
lowest and cheapest measured by gold, for
everything was the highest and the dearest
measured by labor. We have no wish to adopt
the conditions of other nations. Experience
has demonstrated that for us and ours, and for
the present and the future, the protective
system meets our wants, our conditions, pro
motes the National design, and will work out
our destiny better than any other.
That all which McKinley said in that
speech has come true, every intelligent
citizen of the Republic who has watched
the drift during the last five years knows
full well. The bill passed Congress and
became a law. It was attacked by theory.
ignorance and prejudice, and for the
moment, * perhaps, it seemed to those
whose protective principles were not firm
a too radical measure. Then the prosperity
which McKinley predicted dawned, only
to disappear in 1592, when the Democratic
victory spread its blighting effects over
tbe industrial regions of the country.
Then followed two years of panic and dis
tress, which was only lifted from our pros
trated business when the principles bo
eloquently set forth in that address were
again victorious in 1894.
Following is an extract from a notable
speech by McKinley in the Ohio campaign
of last year:
They say prosperity has come. Well, we
have got more prosperity this year than we j
had last, because we had none at all last year, j
Taey say that wages are better this year than j
they were last, but we had little or no wages
last year, and we did not have any prosperity
in this country until after the elections ot
1894. When the people of this country, from
ocean to ocean, rose in their might and in their
majesty as one man and voted in a Republican
House.that was the first rift in the clouds. That
was the first star in the business man's constel
lation. Then, with the feeling that for two
years the Democratic party could not injure
his enterprises, the business man commenced
to do business the best he could, making his
own advancement, and whatever prosperity
we have got now we have got because of that
victory and in spite of the Democratic party.
And now you are ready to vote. The people
of this country everywhere .are ready to vote,
for they are sick and tired of this tariff tinker
ing and the Increased bond-issuing, pension
cutting, queen-restoring Democratic adminis
tration.
In an address, in 1895, to the laboring
men of Chicago, McKinley expressed these
eloquent ntiments:
Peace, order and good will among the people,
with patriotism in their hearts; truth, honor
and justice in the executive, judicial and legis
lative branches of the Government, municipal,
State and National all yielding respect and
obedience to law, all equal before the law, and
all alike amenable to lawâ are the con
ditions that will make our Government too
strong ever to be broken by internal dissen
sions and too powerful ever to be overturned
by any enemy from without. Then will the
government of the people, under the smiles of
heaven, bless, prosper and exalt the people
who sustain and support it.
In America, no one is born to power; none
assured of station or command except by his
own worth or usefulness. But to any post of
honor all who choose may aspire, and history
has proved that the humblest in youth are
frequently the most honored and powerful in
the maturity of strength and age. It has long
been demonstrated that the philosophy of
Jefferson is true, and that this, the land of the
free and self-governed, is the strongest as well
as the best Government in the world. We ac
cept no governmental standards but our own;
we will have no flag but the glorious old stars
and stripes.
That McKinley has comprehensive
views on the vast educational system of
the country his public utterances certainly
indicate. There is nothing sectarian,
nothing narrow about his views on this
important subject.
William McKinley is not only a sincere
and earnest man, but a religious man. He
is a member of the Methodist church. He
Schoolhonse Near Poland .Ohio, Where McKinley Taught in 1860-61.
is one of those who believe that religion is
the strongest, most lasting and most viva
cious of all the powers in the world; that
it is bedded firm as a rock in the insti-
tutions of the Republic. While himself a
member of the Methodist church, how
ever, his religion is broad enough to in
clude all the Christian sects, and reach out
to the broadest humanity.
McKinley's personal appearance is a
great aid as a platform speaker. He a -
ways wears a black frock coat buttoned
all the way down. His face is pale, and
he unconsciously assumes a statuesque
pose. At first, he is slow oi utterance and
low of voice. This is a method with him,
for he has learned that he can only get at
the full strength of his voice and maintain
it by reaching it gradually: By and by
his voice grows louder. It takes but a few
minutes for him to measure the acoustic
properties of the hall and know to a nicety
(that comes only from experience) to what
key to pitch his voice. Then it rings out !
with a bell-like clearness, and cuts through !
and circles around the mightiest of
throngs. As a rule, he makes but few
gestures, but those he does mane are
emphatic.
Having captured his hearers by his
manifestation of sincerity and earnest
ness, he proceeds, step by step, to convince
them by his logic; then he hammers into
them the truth as he understands it; and
j finally the sum is worked out, the problem
is solved and the argument has reached
its demonstration and then McKinley is
afire; his voice sounds like an anvil struct
by a sledge-hammer wielded by his strong
right arm, which now rises up and down
with quick, terrific force; his form trem
bles with energy and seems to grow to i
heroic size; his deep-set eyes flash out like
living coals. This is the moment. of the
orator's triumph. When his voice stops
there is a thunder of applause, repeated
' again and again.
It may be said of McKinley that as a
youth he was industrious and earnest; as a
young soldier, he was courageous and
noble: as a lawyer, painstaking and capa
ble; as a statesman, able and honorable,
and as a Governor, broad-minded and
fearless in the discharge of all duties.
McKinley expressed himself from the
| very beginning of his public career in Con-
I gress as against the tariff reform
j that means retrenchment and poverty
in the homes of America. He
is against the policy that would place
the American workingman in direct
competition with the pauper labor of
Europe and the semi-slaves of Asia. He
proposes to lead the battle of the people
against the ruin and poverty of Demo
cratic free trade. In the name of the man-
hood which free trade would impoverish,
of the womanhood which it threatens with
degradation, of the childhood it would
stunt and oppress; in the names of Ameri
can homes, American schools and Ameri-
can citizenship; in the name of American
toilers of every age and class; in the name
of liberty, humanity and progress, Mc-
Kinley pledges himself to fight free trade
and industrial serfdom until complete and
final triumph crowns the people's cause.
Where cheapness is only to be attained by a
depression of the wages of labor to the neigh
borhood of the European standard I prefer
that it be dispensed with. One thing must
answer to another, and I hold that the farmers
of this country can better afford, as a matter
of pecuniary advantage, to pay a good pi-ice
for manufactured goods than to" obtain them
lower through the depression and inadequacy
of the wages of the artisan and laborer.

politician ; he is a business man, but as a
business- man he has surrounded him
self > with the ablest politicians. . â¢ The
most ; singular feature of the McKin
ley campaign, ; as ifranaged by Mr.
Hanna, is that -it was almost en
tirely a campaign of correspondence.
There were no missionaries sent hither
and thither, but the number of letters
that were written is amazing." And no less
amazing is the grasp of detail that Hanna
had of the various districts in the various
States, and the exact situation in each of
the districts. A recent writer who spent
two hours very pleasantly and very profit
ably in Hanna's political headquarters one
day thus describes the scene: "There
were present M. A. Hanna and Chair
man Dick of the State Republican
Committee. Everything was in perfect
order and absolute quiet reigned. Every
minute or two a stenographer or mes
senger passed through the office into ad-
joining rooms.
" 'Bring me some ink, John,' said Hanna,
as the office-boy passed through, 'and take
these telegrams to the telegraph office at
once.' . "'â¢ y; â 'â â '. - â â¢;'â¢-â '
"And, never ceasing in his work and
never looking up from his desk, Hanna
gave his orders or made known his wants
as each employe entered..
" 'I see,' said he, continuing to scratch
away with his pen and addressing Chair-
man Dick, 'that you have marked this
Thirty-third District in New York "Too
late."
" 'Yes, sir,' responded Mr. Dick.
"'You are mistaken. The primaries
have not yet been held.'
"Hanna opens every letter and assigns
j it to the proper department for answer,
and the way in which he can remember
what each letter contains is one of the
most astonishing things about the man.
He gets five deliveries of mail per day,
and at each delivery he now receives over
a bushel basket full of letters. He plunges
into his correspondence as though it were
a feast, and,, not content with dictating
replies, he answers in his own handwrit-
| ing a large variety of letters wherever he
! thinks the influence of a personal com-
munication will be greater. ' Hanna is
' vastly resourceful and many sided and bis
capacity for work is immense.
"Hanna calls the" McKinley campaign
a spontaneous outburst of the people, and
points to the heaping mass of unsolicited
correspondence with a glow of pride. With
an emphatic smash of / his prodigious fist
upon the desk, he declares that the masses
are for McKinley, and with ~ a still more
vigorous smash of the selfsame fist he de-
nies that the McKinley campaign is a
campaign of boodle. He insists that no
money is being spent, and that manufac
turers are not being 'fried,' editors and
statesmen to the contrary notwithstand-
ing.''
And now for a pen picture of the man
who has suddenly risen before the eye of
the public. He possesses a burly frame, a
round head, a strong but not overintel-
lectual face, and be â . is -without . doubt a
very good liver. Hanna would impress
any one as a solid man, physically, men-
tally and morally. In manner he is bluff
! and curt. When he opens conversation
\ with you he does it with an ill-tempered
\ growl, and you mentally resolve that you
are about to spend a few unpleasant mo-
ments. But at the next question his voice
melts and his eyes twinkle, and you find
that you are really having quite an
agreeable time. There is good blood in
Hanna, plenty of it, and Rudyard Kipling
would add, "Ah, the bowels of him," for
he is a man of courage. He is fresh, vig
| orous, wholesome, ; and his capacity for
work rests upon firm physical conditions. -
How did Hanna make his money? yHe
made it legitimately that is, I mean it is
a legitimate ' growth of solid business in-
vestments and not the result of specula
tion. He foresaw very clearly, and was
one of the earliest to foresee, the financial
possibilities of the Lake Superior iron ore
region. He became interested in the de
velopment of the iron ore districts and
later in vessel property to : transport the
ore to the railways and the furnaces, and
in that manner laid the basis of ; his colos
sal fortune. Then he undertook to operate
street railways in Cleveland,'' and is now
the president of a very profitable consoli
dation of lines. He bought the Euclid
avenue Opera-house at a big bargain, and
this now yields a substantial revenue.
question is frequently asked: ,., Why
is Hanna so deeply interested * in McKin
ley's campaign? He has certainly given
McKinley a management which money
could not buy, for he is ,in the campaign
.with all the energies that he possesses.
The local papers day that he is slated to
be Secretary of Agriculture, , and . he 'is
frequently .; pictured in "- blue jeans
hoeing potatoes in the garden. But Hanna
says he wants no office, and he -is
evidently sincere in his assertion. He is
in the campaign purely out -of r friendship
for McKinley .yy He manifested the same
impersonal interest in Sherman's y cam
paign eight years ago, and did all he could
as delegate-at-large and a potent factor in
State politics to keep Ohio in; line for the
statesman 'â¢' from Mansfield. Sherman's

One must take a glimpse of Hanna's
home life to ascertain the completeness of
the man. y It is simple ; and cheerful. 7He
likes to: be with his - family, and :is in bis
element when the table ; is I surrounded \ by
guests. Above all, he likes to entertain

Outside of political circles it is a; rare
thing to find a man whose : reputation ex
tends over so y wide a scope of country as
does that "of M.* A. Hanna, who - is one of
the city's most prominent, influential and
deservedly honored citizens, and y; one of
the \ foremost men of the Buckeye State.
The business \ interests of Mr. Hanna are
not confined to Cleveland or Ohio, but are
distributed over a wide territory, reaching
into at least half a dozen States, and are
as diversified and important as they are
extensive. ,' *
;'- For half a century the Hanna family
has been most closely identified with the
commercial, financial: and industrial his-*
tory of Cleveland, and its members during
that time have contributed as much as
those of any family toward the building
up of the city and its many industries Â«nd
institutions. Mr. Hanna's father. Dr.
Leonard Hanna, was a leading citizen of
New : Lisbon/- Ohio, "until his removal to
Cleveland in : 1852, when â¢ he . at once took
rank with the prominent men of the city.
He was one of the founders of the whole
sale grocery house of Hanna. Garretson &
Co., which was one of the largest and most
important firms in that line in the city,
the partners being his brother, Robert
Hanna, and Hiram 1 Garretson, both of
whom were then arid later very prom
inent among the leading business men of
the city. . '
: M. A. Hanna is a native of Ohio. He was
born at New Lisbon, Columbiana County,
on September 24. 1837, and it was in that
county that his early boyhood was spent.
He y attended the schools of his ; native
town, and upon his removal to Cleveland
was given "the full benefit of the city
schools, and the thorough public
school education he there obtained
was supplemented by > a season at the
Western Reserve "College. His business
career began in 1857, when he became an
employe of the firm of which bis father
was a member. ;He continued with that
firm . and its successor, Robert Hanna &
Co., until 1867, ' and during that time
originated the Buckeye Oil Company,
which he managed in connection with his
other duties, thus giving evidence at that
early age of the splendid business talents
and capacity : which have been so fully
developed in later life.
On September 27, 1864, Mr. Hanna was
married to Miss C. Augusta Rhodes, daugh
ter of the late D. P. Rhodes, and three
years later, when the great pioneer iron
and coal firm of Rhodes & Card retired
from business, he became a member of its
successor, the firm of Rhodes & Co., the
other members of which were Robert
Rhodes ; and G. H. Warmington. They
were heavy dealers in coal and iron,
and for a number; of years did an ex
tensive business, their mines being located
in the X uscarawa Valley, while their trade
extended all over the country. The firm
was dissolved in 1885. being succeeded by
M. A. Hanna & Co., of which Mr. Hanna
became the senior member.
" While Mr. Hanna's labors were for a
number of years given to this great enter
prise, he was and is interested in many
ways in other lines of commercial and
business activity. In 1872 he organized in
connection with other leading capitalists
the Cleveland Transportation Company,
which built a line of steamers and their
consorts for the Lake Superior iron-ore
trade, and of this he has been a director
from the first: and was for several
years its general manager, resigning
the same ) when other business interests
grew to such an-, extent as to demand . the
most , of his time. In 1881 he organized
the , West Republic Mining Company Jof
Marquette County, Mich., and was elected
its president, which ; position and that of
director he still holds. In 1882 he organ
ized the Pacific Coal and Iron Company,
with headquarters at St. Paul, Minn., was
elected its president, and still continues in
the same position. "'â¢'-'â â¢
He was a director in' and vice-president
of the Hubbell Stove Company of Buffalo.
In 18S2 he purchased a controlling in
terest , in the West Side Street , Railway
Company, and, with "his usual enter
prise and courage, . put money and man
agement enough into it to make it a
success. He was elected president of the
company and has - remained *at the head
of that enterprise during its changes and
consolidations. Mr. Hanna is a director
of the Globe Iron Works, one of %he largest
ship-building concerns in the country, and
to him as much as to any one man is due
the credit of making Cleveland the largest
ship-building point in the United States.
- Mr. Hanna has always been a Repub
lican and a believer in a tariff for the pro
tection of American industry. He is one
of those who believe that every business
man should exercise the right influence in
the conduct of affairs, believing in, per
sonal effort as a matter of right and duty,
and he has been active in the politics of
Ohio for a number of years; not a
seeker after office, but a â  seeker after
good government administered by the best
men. He is recognized to-day as one of
the political leaders of the State, his ad-
Vice and counsel being sought on all im
portant occasions :by those having in
charge the various campaigns, and in this
connection, it may be said, in the lan
guage of one of his friends, "M. A. Hanna
is a power in Ohio politics, : and he has
always stood for clean and honest
methods." In 1884 he was one of the dele
gates-at-large from the i Republican State
Convention to the National Convention
in Chicago, and during that and the follow
ing years served on the Republican State
Executive Committee of Ohio. In August,
1885, he was appointed by President Cleve
land as one of the Government directors of
the Union Pacific Railroad, a position un
sought, but accepted, because it was an
honorary one, to which no salary was at
tached and in which he could serve the
public without the charge of .; personal
motive. ; In the ; fall ;of ; that year he was
summoned to the West by reason of the
labor troubles along y the line, and gave
several weeks to a careful and* proper set
tlement of the question at issue in connec
tion with other directors of the road. '
In 1888 he was elected delegate to the
Republican National Convention and sup
ported Senator John Sherman's candidacy
before that convention. He labored â¢ zeal
ously for the success of Senator Sherman,
who is his warm personal friend, y and to
him â¢ that y gentleman y owes, probably
more than to any other man, his last elec
tion to the United States Senate.
But, in a large sense, we cannot dedicate,
we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this
ground. The brave men, living and dead,
who struggled here have consecrated far above
; our voor power to add or detract. The world
will ' little â ] note nor long remember what we
say here, but it never can forget what they did
here. ; It is rather for us here to be dedicated
tothe great task remaining before us, that
from these honored dead we take increased
devotion lo that cause for which they gave the
last full measure of devotion; that we here
highly resolve that these dead shall not have
died in vain; that this Nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom, and that
government of the people, by - the people and
for -j the people shall .' not perish ; from { this

REPUBLICANS HAVE
GUARDED INDUSTRY.
Words of Eminent Advo
cates of the Protective
Tariff.
The Burning Eloquence of James
G. Blame and John A.
Logan.
National Wealth and Commerc;al Pros-
perity Have Followed the Policy
of Protection.
It is generally conceded that in the let
ter addressed to the National Republican
Committee by James G. Blame accepting
the nomination for the Presidency in 1884,
the /arguments in favor of the American
policy of protection were thoroughly pre
sented. The issue of such vital importance
is once more before voters. What Mr.
Blame said in 1884 remains true. The
progress of the country under the Repub
lican policy was ably traced by the great
leader. Some parts of his letter make
lively reading. .
Almost the first act of the Republicans
when they came into power in 1861 was
the establishment of the principle of pro
tection to American labor and American
capital. This principle the Republican
party has ever since maintained, whiie the
Democratic party has steadily warred
against it, and has succeeded in over
throwing protective tariffs more than
once. -
"After 1860 the business of the country
was encouraged by a "protective tariff. At
the end of twenty years the total property
of the United States, as returned by the
census of 1880. amounted to the enormous
aggregate of '$44,000,000,000. This great
result was attained notwithstanding the
fact that countless millions had in the in
terval been wasted in the progress of a
bloody war. It thus appears that/while
our population between 1860 and 1880 in
creased 60 per cent, the aggregate prop
erty of the country increased 214 per cent,
showing a vastly enhanced wealth per cap
ita among the ' people. Thirty thousand
millions of dollars had been added during
these twenty years to the permanent
wealth of the Nation.
."These results are regarded by the older
nations of the world as phenomenal. That
our country should surmount the peril
and the cost of a gigantic war, and for an
â  entire period of twenty years make an
average- gain to its wealth of . $125,000,000
per month, surpasses the experience of all
other nations, ancient or modern. Even
the opponents of the system do not pre-
tend that in the whole history of civiliza
tion parallel can be found to the ma-
terial progress of the United States since
the accession of the Reoublican party to
power. ;
"The farmers see that in 1860 Massachu-
setts and Illinois had ' about the same
wealthâ between $800,000,000 and $900,000,
- that in 1880* Massachusetts had
advanced to $2,600,000,000, while Illinois
had advanced to $3,200,000,000. -They see
that nine agricultural States of the West
have grown so rapidly that' the aggregate
addition to their wealth since 1860 is al-
most as great as the wealth of the entire
country in that year. They see that the
South, which is almost exclusively agri-
cultural, has shared in - the general pros-
perity, and having recovered from the loss
and devastation of war has gained so rap-
idly y that its: total wealth is at least
the double of that which it possessed in
1860 exclusive of slaves."
This was a part of the picture painted
by Mr. Blame of the prosperity of the
country in 1884,' resulting from the pro
tective oolicy of the Republican party,
these words being written : only a few
months before the Democratic party took
control of the country. Mr. Blame went
on to point out more particularly the
agency of the Republican party in that
prosperity
"In these extraordinary developments
the farmers see. the helpful influence of a
home market, and they see that the finan
cial and revenue system enacted since
the Republican party came into power
has established: and constantly expanded
the home market. They see that even in
the case of wheat, which is our chief
cereal export, they have sold in '.* the
average of tne years since the close of the
war three bushels at home to one they
have sold abroad ; and that in the case of
corn, the only other j cereal which we ex
port to any extent, TOO ; bushels have been
used at home to 3% bushels exported. In
some years the disparity has been so great
that for every; peck of corn exported 100
bushels have been consumed in the home
market. The farmers see that in the in
creasing competition from the grain-fields
of Russia and from ; the distant plains of
India, the growth of the home market be
comes, daily of greater concern to them,
and that its impairment would depreciate
the value of every acre of ! tillable land in
the Union." "^
y Mr. Blame had no fear that foreign com
merce could suffer under the protective
tariff, y and drew the following picture,
which is as illustrative now as it was then:
' â  "A frequent accusation by our oppo
nents is that the foreign commerce of the
country has ' steadily.? decayed , under . the
influence of the protective tariff. In this
way they seek to array this importing in
fluence ; against "* the Republican party. It ,
is a common and yet radical error to con
found the commerce of a' country with its
carrying trade an error of ten committed
innocently and y sometimes : designedly
but an error so gross that it does , not * dis
; tinguish between the ship and its ' cargo.
"Foreign i commerce represents the ex
ports and imports of . a country regardless
of the vessel that may, carry the commod
ities of exchange. Our carrying trade has,
from obvious causes, suffered i many dis
couragements since . 1860, but , our foreign
commerce has in the same period steadily
and prodigiously increasedâ increased, in
deed, at : a rate and to an amount
which: absolutely dwarfs all previous
developments of our trade beyond
the sea. From 1860; to 1884 the ; foreign
commerce of v the United States (divided
with ? approximate accuracy ; between ex
ports and imports) reached the astounding
aggregate "of i $24,000,000,000. The balance
in this vast trade inclined in our favor,
but it would have been much larger if our
trade with the countries of America, else
where referred to, had been more wisely
adjusted/fi^^^^^^^^^P
"It tis \ difficult even to : appreciate the
magnitude of ourf export trade "* since :; 1860,
and we can gain a correct conception of it
only by y comparison - with preceding ; re
sults in the same field. ; ' The total exports
from the United States from the Declara
MRS. WILLIAM McKINLEY SR.
tion of Independence in 1776 down to the
day of Lincoln's election in 1860, added to
all that had been previously exported
from the American colonies from their
original settlement, amounted to less than
$9,000,000,000. On the other hand our ex
ports from 1860 to the- close of the last
fiscal year exceeded $12,000,000,000â the
whole of it being the product of American
labor."
Mr. Blame was never tired of talking
about the great home market which a pro
tective tariff served to preserve to Ameri
can industry.
"Facts touching the growth and con
sumption of ' our cereals at home give us
some slight conception' of the vastness of
the internal commerce of the United
States. They suggest also that, in addi
tion to the advantages which the Ameri
can people enjoy from protection against
foreign competition, they enjoy the ad
vantages of absolute free trade over a
larger area and with a greater population
than any other nation.
"The internal commerce of our States
and Territories is carried on without let or
hindrance, without tax, detention or gov
ernmental interference of any kind what
ever. It spreads freely over an area of
3,500,000 square miles â almost equal in ex
tent to the whole continent of Europe.
It is impossible to point to â a : single
monopoly in the United States that has
been created or. fostered by the industrial
system upheld by the Republican party.
, "Compared with our foreign commerce,
these domestic exchanges are inconceiv
ably great in amount, requiring merely as i
one instrumentality as large mileage of
railway as exists in all the other nations of
the world combined. *.-.
-Â» "These internal exchanges are estimated
by the Statistical Bureau of the -Treasury
Department to be annually twenty times
as great in amount as our foreign com
merce. It is into this vast field of home
tradeâ at once the creation and the herit
age of the American people â that foreign j
nations are striving by every device to l
enter. It is into this field that the oppo- !
nents of our tariff system would freely ad- !
mit the countries of ' Europe â countries i
into whose reciprocal trade we could not
reciprocally enter; countries to which we
should be surrendering every advantage
of trade, from which we should be gaining
nothing in return.'
"As a substitute for the industrial sys
tem which under Republican administra
tion has developed such extraordinary
prosperity our opponents offer a policy
which is but a series of experiments upon
our system of revenues a policy whose
end must be harm to our manufacturers
and greater barm to our labor. Experi
ment in the industrial and financial system
is the country's greatest dread, as stability
is ; its y greatest boon. Even the uncer
tainty resulting from the recent tariff agi
tation in Congress has hurtfully affected
the business of the entire country. Who
can measure the harm to our shops and
our homes, to our farms and our com
merce, if the uncertainty of perpetual
tariff agitation is to be inflicted on the
country?"
General John A. Logan, accepting the
Vice- Presidential nomination on .the
ticket with Blame, also discussed the
tariff in a manner not uninstructive to
voters now
:' "If there be a nation on the face of the
earth which might, if it were a 'desirable
thing, build a wall upon its every bound
ary line, deny communion to all the
world and proceed to live upon' its own
resources and productions, that nation is
the United - States. There .is hardly a
legitimate necessity of civilized, commu
nities which cannot be produced from the
extraordinary resources of our ! several
States and Territories with their manu
factories, mines, farms, timber lands .and
waterways. This, taken -\ in connection
with the fact that our form of government 'i
js entirely unique among the nations of j
The Home of Major McKinley at Canton.
the world, makes it utterly absurd to in-
stitute comparisons between our own
economic systems and those of other Governments,
ernments, and especially to borrow sys-"
terns from them. We stand alone in our
circumstances, our forces, our possibilities
and our aspirations.
"Although in the great number of re-
forms instituted by the Republican party
sufficient credit has not been awarded to
that of tariff reform, its benefits have,
nevertheless, been felt through the land.
The principle underlying this measure â¢
has been in process of gradual develop-
ment by the Republican party during the
comparatively brief period of its power,
" and to-day , a portion of its antiquated
Democratic opponents make unwilling
concession to the correctness of the
doctrine of an equitably '. adjusted protec
tive tariff by slowly following in its foot-
steps." Â
The following utterance of General
Logan may also be recalled at this time:
"Now, if the products of those (for
i eign) countries are to be placed in our
> markets, alongside of American products,
either the American capitalist must suffer
j in his legitimate profits or he must make
' j the American laborer suffer in the attempt
j to compete with -the species of labor re
, | ferred to. In the case of a substantial re
i duction of pay. there can be no com pen
i sating advantages for the American la-
borer, because the articles of daily con-
sumption which he usesâ with the excep
tion of articles not produced in the United
States, and easy : of .being specially pro
: vided for, litre tea and coffee â are grown
in our own country and Would not be
' affected in price by the lowering of duties.
"Therefore, while he would secure less
for his labor, his cost of living. . would not
be decreased. Being practically placed
upon the pay of a European laborer, our
own would be deprived of facilities for
educating and, sustaining bis family re-
spectably ; he would be shorn of the proper
j opportunities of self-improvement, and his
I value as a citizen, charged with a portion
j of the obligations of government, would
j be lessened.
"The obvious policy of our Government
is to protect both capital and labor by a
prouer imposition of duties. This protec
tion should extend to , every article of
American production which goes to build
up the general prosperity of our people."
William McKinley has been one of the
staunchest defenders of the American pro-
tective tariff. - His views are ' embodied in
the following utterance :
"The general question of the tariff in-
volves higher, considerations than we are
wont to bring to its discussion. Our polit
ical system differs from all others. Uni
versal citizenship and equal suffrage con-
stitutes the foundation upon which our
Republic rests, ' and the real and wider
question of the tariff is what will best
maintain our industrial pursuits and labor
conditions suitable to the high political
â¢ duties of our people and the exalted trusts
. that are confided to them? That is the
real question. in its comprehensive view.
It touches the health and progress of the
Republic, for it touches the condition, mor
al, physical and intellectual of the citizen
from whom it must draw its force and
character, and . strength You cannot
affect the citizen either for good or illl
without the Nation feeling it. The rela
tion of the people to the Government and
the Government to the people is so close
and intimate that you cannot touch the
one without its being quickly felt by the
other." > '' :
So, Mr. President, when I speak for the
people oj lowa on this question I speak for
them as citizens of a common country,
having interests in common with all the
people of every part of this country as a
common Nation and a common people and as
agriculturists, prospering because other por
tions of the country prosper that arc not
engaged in agriculture. â WILLIAM B.

Conventions That Have Been Excit-

Historic.
How many even well-informed persons
can recall with any clearness the fateful
Chicago convention of 1860, when Simon
Cameron came as near being an instru
ment in the bands of divine providence
as he ever did in his life, engineering the
anti-Seward combine, defeating the New
York statesman and nominating the "lean
and lanky Lincoln," as many of the news
paper headlines of the day expressed it;
that yrar when the great Charleston con
vention was shivered to atoms; when the
Douglas Democrats nominated tho Little
Giant at Baltimore, and the seceders from
that convention took up John Bell of
Tennessee and Edward Everett of Massa
chusetts; when at Richmond another wing
of the Democrats named John C. Breckin
ridge of Kentucky and Joseph Lane of
Oregon; when the Abolitionists nominated
Gerrit Smith, and the State of Texas
flaunted a lone star Presidential banner
inscribed with the name of Sam Houston.
In this vast and active republic political
events pile upon one another with light
ning speed, and even the great tragedies
resulting from the assassin's bullet and
those aimost equally tragic blows of ill
luck which have remanded popular idols
to obscurity and death soon become vague
and misty even in the minds of lead
actors in the scenes of the time.
Politics were very much simplified in
1864, compared to those of 1860, when,
amid the thunder of cannon all over the
South, and when the horrid din of war
was easily audible at the National capital,
Lincoln and Johnson were nominated at
Baltimore, and General McClellan and
"Gentleman George" Pendleton at Chi
cago. The only ripple of discontent with
the old parties was the defection of the
radical Republicans who nominated Gen
eral Fremont and John Cochran of
New York at Cleveland. Fremont, par
tially through jealousy, partially because
of a sincere dissatisfaction with the con
duct of the war, resigned his commission
in company with Beveral generals of less
note, and had a sublime confidence in his
ability to divert enough of the Republican
vote to insure his election. Yet bow many
public men, to say nothing of men not in
public life, will recall the holding of that
convention?
The Radicals and Peace Democrats were
alike remanded to the rear, and Lincoln
was sustained, only to be killed by the
bullet of Booth.
In 1868, at Chicago, it was inevitable
that the Republicans should nominate
Grant, and upon the ticket with him was
placed Colfax of Indiana, who was then
quite popular. At New York, a little
earlier, Horatio Seymour had been nom
inated by the Democrats, with Francis P.
Blair of Missouri as the candidate for
Vice-President. The Grant convention
was full of the enthusiasm that must in
evitably associate with the name of the
victorious general of a great war. There
was no contest, and the spectacle was
rather a mass-meeting to celebrate the re
storation of the Union and the end of the
term of the almost impeached Johnson,
than a convention of a political party.
For hours the vast assembly did little
but stand on its feet and cheer and sing
patriotic songs. Old Jesse Grant, father
of the general, stood near the front of the
staging, tears coursing down his cheeks,
witnessing the glorification of his son.
Penton and Wilson were both prominently
in the race for the Vice- Presidential office,
and there was much soreness over the
nomination of Colfax, and not a few were
pleased with that gentleman's subsequent
humiliation.
The Republican Convention of 1872 was
little more than an indorsement of the
administration, but it was amid tremen
dous enthusiasm, which fairly lifted the
roof from the old Philadelphia Academy
of Music when the "Galena Tanner" and
the "Natick Cobbler" were placed in nom
ination.
In 1876 there was a strong feeling in
favor of the nomination of Grant for a
third term, but this dissipated long before
the Republican Convention met at Cin
cinnati in June, and -party affections were
divided between Blame and ... Conkling,
with numerous favorite in the back
ground.
It was the contest between the two bril
liant leaders transferred from the halls of
Congress to the floor of the political con
vention. That Blame had the great dele
gates as well as the popular following no
one denied. Conkling cou'd not control
the delegation from bis own State. Came
ron was able to divert the vote of Pennsyl
vania from Blame only by securing in
structions from Hartranft. Bristow, as an
"anti-boss" Republican, had a strong fol
lowing. Oliver P. Morton, Logan, Hayes,
Evarts, Morgan, Wheeler, Adams, Hart
ranft and other favorite sons trailed along,
their hopes being based upon a probable
breakdown of the lead ers.
On the very Sunday previous to the
meeting' of the convention, and when
nearly all of the delegates were on the
ground, Blame was stricken while on his
way to church in Washington with some
thing closely akin to apoplexy, and his
adherents and opponents alike y were
gloomy and sympathetic. Later reports
of the favorable condition of the patient
revived the Blame enthusiasms and an
tagonisms, and on Monday the fight was
as intense as though the hand of disease
had not touched the man from Maine.
Edward McPherson, who died a tragic
death at his Pennsylvania home a few
months ago, was made permanent chair
man of the convention. The most sensa
tional episode of the time was- the excite
ment that followed Mcpherson's ruling in
the case of Pennsylvania's delegates! John
Hampton, the brilliant Pittsburg lawyer,
among them, who protested against the
casting of the entire vote of the State by
Cameron as a unit.
Excitement was intense, and at one
time it appeared that McPherson would
be driven from the chair. Finally order
prevailed and the convention sustained
the chairman. Blame out of danger, as it
was reported to the convention, the strug
gle between the contending elements was
renewed with increased bitterness. A
more bitter fight was never waged in a
convention, . but Conkling and Cameron
held their forces so well in hand that they
were able to make Hayes the nominee by
somewhat liberal promises to the friends
of Wheeler and Morton of the honor of sec
ond place on the ticket.
Never were more brilliant speeches
made for the purpose of placing candi-
dates in nomination. That of Ingersoll
nominating Blame has been placed among
the political classics. Stewart L. Wood-
ford nominated Conkling. Noyes made
the speech for Hayes, and was seconded
by old Ben Wade. Upon the first ballot
Blame had 291 votes, Bristow 113, Conx-
ling 96. Morton 125, Hayes 65. There was
no material change until" the fifth ballot.
The anti-Blame managers held their men
steady and Blame stock went down. On
the sixth the break was made for Hayes,
Indiana withdrawing Morton and leading
the stampede, and the nomination was a
fact. 'Â°IÂ§Â£&B|
In the Republican convention of 1880, at
Chicago, "Cae3arism" was the great cry of
the opponents of the Grant-Con klmg com-
bination. Grant had returned from cir
cling the world and was as much a popu
lar figure as ever. All the machinery of
expert management was brought into
play to insure the ex-President's nomina
tion. Contests were acutely arranged.
The unit rule was enforced to the extent
possible. Garfield came* to the front at
once as an open antagonist of these crafty
methods, and was looked upon as a likely
dark horse. His eloquent nomination of
j Sherman gave him much additional popu
larity. Joy of Michigan nominated
Blame, and created some amusement by
mistaking his candidate's initials, calling
i him -'James A. Blame" when he rounded
his final period. Conkling nominated
I Grant in an eloquent speech. The long
! balloting and intense excitement have
! been equaled in no other convention. The
I famous 306 phalanx of Grant was never
j seriously broken, and when the stampede
j came for Garfield on the thirty-sixth bal-
lot, giving the latter the nomination, the
I Grant delegates never for a moment
â  swerved from their fealty.
The Republican Convention at Chicago
in 1884 was again the scene of the conten
tion of the Blame and anti- Blame forces.
Arthur, made President by the assassina
i tion of Garfield, hoped for the nomination,
| and to some extent the office-holding ele
â¢ ment was controlled for him. . Robertson,
however, who was Collector of the Port of
New YorK, was a stanch friend of Blame.
Arthur, Sherman, Logan, Edmunds, Haw
ley and Blame was the great array of names
presented to the convention. This time
popular sentiment was triumphant.
Blame was nominated on the fourth bai
lot, amid the craziest enthusiasm, which
; was almost equaled when Logan was
nominated for second place.
THE LONGEST CAMPAIGN.
VAN BUREN AND RUIN.
Log Cabins Dragged Through the
Streets, Songs Sung and Hard
Cider Drunk.
The Presidential campaign of 1840 was
the longest in the history of the country,
"and, excepting that of 1860. altogether the
most exciting. It began eleven months
before tbe election with the nomination of
General W. H. Harrison at Harrisburg in
December, 1839.
The campaign that succeeded was one of
extraordinary, excitement and incident.
According to Mr. Benton it was conducted
on the Harrison Bide by the banks and
their agents, who "used money in fabu- j
lous amounts.and in ways not dreamed of."
The Harrison otherwise the Whigs
âwere not in the least moved by the com
plaints and charges of the Democrats,
otherwise the "Locofocos," but continued
to hold their big meetings, to exhibit their
pictures, to sing their doggerel rhymes, to
drink their hard cider, and to drag their
canoes and log cabins .on wheels through
the streets and along the country roa '3.
They "got back" at the Locofocos with
charges quite as serious as those against
which tbey were called upon to defend
themselves.
They declared , that Mr. Van Burenâ

whose father had kept. a country tav
ernwas an aristocrat, .a. monarchist in
fact, who lived in royal style in the
White House, who ate * his soup out of
spoons of gold and his pie with knives of
silver; < who honored the rich and despised
the poor; who demanded a standing army
of 200,000 men under his. own control, for
what sinister purpose of enslavement of
the people ;â¢ is easily/ inferred. He-had
wasted the public revenues, had v increased
the public - expenditure, and ; had added
120,000,000 to ' the â¢ public debt. /He was
hostile to the churches in all their sects,
and sought the destruction of the minis
ters of religion. He was the enemy of free'
labor, who aimed to bring the i wages of
American : working-men ;to the European
level, and to destroy the profits of 5 Ameri
can farmers. Among the "minor charges
were two: -That he had established new
mints in which it cost 40 per / cent |of the
value of gold eagles to coin them, and that

turned put 10- cent pieces at a cost of 30
cents each! And a great deal more of the
same kind, ending with a declaration that
one term was enough for any man.
In fact, however, the real > issues of the
campaign related to currency and banking
and the tariff. General Harrison's position
on that subject was authoritatively staled
in these words: '"He is in favor of such
judicious tariff regulations as shall pro
vide for the actual wants of the Govern
ment and protect the National- industry,
without affording the means of extrava
gance, or a surplus \ beyond what may be
necessary to discharge its current and ex
isting obligations," holding it "to be the
duty of the Government to keep its ex
penses within its ordinary revenues." .It
was, however, the opinion of General Har
rison and his supporters that even I upon
this moderate view of tariff legislation
a sufficient protection might be bad to
give to the farmers profitable prices for
their products, and to the artisans and
laborers of the country constant employ
ment, fair wages and prompt pay in
short, "{2 a day and roast beef."
Â©ut of a total of 2,411,700 votes, ot
which 7059 were for an anti-slavery candi
date, General Harrison had a majority of
146,315, and in the electoral colleges 23-1
votes against 60 for Mr. Van Buren. y
Among the Whie pictures we reproduce
two of the most characteristic, entitled re
spectively â¢â¢Harrison and Prosperity,"
"Van Buren and Ruin." The method of
these pictures is familiar enough now, but
they were a great deal of a novelty then,
and rendered powerful service for the
Whig cause, as, although much exagger
ated, of course, they were descriptive of an
actually existing condition. These car
toons admirably illustrate not only the
political morals of the time but the crude
condition of wood engraving as well.
Brilliant and Ben ficeut.
Ex-Governor John D. Long of Massa
chusetts makes a claim for Republicanism
in his "History of the Republican Party"
which will be accepted as true by all Re
publicans. He says: "Parties, like indi
viduals, sometimes suffer from the un
broken sequence of their own good record.
No political party in any age or quarter of
the civilized world ever had so brilliant
and beneficent a career or lived up to its
own standards so faithfully as the Repub
lican party of _ncoln and Harrison. There
has been at times a tendency rather to
fling at its grand old record than to count
tne value of its work."
All that we have ever asked in our National
platforms and in the debates of this chamber
is that the people who dwell in the United
States shall have a fair opportunityâ

He Has a Bent for Lite rat are and

lean Novel,
It may not be generally known but it is
true that Mr. Reed has literary ambitions.
I have myself heard the Speaker say that
j if he had not gone into politics when a
young man he would have tried to make a
competence in the Jaw, and alter that
would have tried his hand at literature.
He believes, in a modest, way, be could
have made a name for himself with
his pen. Literature is his natural bent.
It is his pas-uon. To this day he has
I aspirations in that field. There are few
things worth reading that he has not read.
He has read the best in French and
Italian, and is now turning bis attention
to Spanish. He does not like translations,'
but loves the original tongue. French
and Italian he has mastered, Snanisb he
will have in a few months and German
will come next. Reed talks more of books
than of politics. Among his friends his
literary attainments, his analyses and
critiques, his play of fancy and imagina
tion, are greatly admired. One of these
friends, himself a literary man of note,
said to me: "If Mr. Reed would go into
literature he would make himself famous.
He could write the great American novel
which we have all * been looking for so
many years." .. y
, Speaker Reed is a fluent French scholar*
and his library contains the works of all
the best writers in the original, particu
larly those of / Bourget, Maupassant, Dau

THE REPUBLICAN
FINANCIAL RECORD.
How the Great War Debt
Was Reduced by the
Great War Party.
Only to Be Increased by the
Monstrous Bond Issues
of Cleveland.
A Monetary History of Which the
Party and the Nation Have Rea- â 
son to Be Proud.
The story of the connection of the Re
publican party with the question of the
tariff makes an interesting and instructive
chapter in the politics of the country dur
ing the past third' of a century. In the
beginning of its career the party did not
concern itself seriously witn industrial or
monetary questions. Opposition to slav
ery extension into the Territories was the
issue which called the party into being,
and that question presented itself in such
a portentous shape that for several years
no other issue could get a hearing. The
platform of 1856, adopted in the first Na
tional Convention which the Republican
parly ever had, confined itself to the ques
tion^ slavery extension in its various
bearings, except that it coupled polygamy
with slavery as "twin relics of barbarism,"
which Congress legally could and morally
should prohibit in the Territories, and
that it advocated a "railroad to the Pacific
Ocean" and appropriations for the "im
provement of rivers and harbors of a Na
tional character."
The Democratic Walker tariff of 1846
abolishing the specific and compound
duties of the Whig act of 1842, putting ad
valorem duties in their place and making
a general reduction in rates, was in opera
tion when the Republicans held their first
National Convention, and a year later than
this or in 1857 a bill making a further re
duction was passed. This brought the gen
eral line of duties to a lower level than it
had touched since before the war of 1812.
A few months after the cut in duties in
1857 the panic of that year oc
curred. The balance of trade, was
against the country during almost the en
tire life of the tariffs of 1846 and 1857, and
in nearly every year of the period the gold
exportation was heavy. Though the mer
chandise imports were larger the duties
under the act of 1857 were so low that the
Government's revenue fell short ot its ex
penditures, loans bad to be made and the
debt was increased. Manufacturers at the
same time cried out for higher duties for
the purpose of protection.
In the Vermont State Convention, wnich
met on July 13, 1854, and whicb^adopted
the name Republican, for the new party
which was just arising to keep slavery out
of Kansas, there was framed a declaration
of principles in which appears this demand :
"A tariff for revenue, with proper dis
crimination in favor, of American indus
try." This was the earliest tariff plank ever
placed in a Republican platform. Other
States in the next few years made similar
declarations, but- none were incorporated
in a National convention until the, party
was six years old. Here is the first tariff
plank which ever appeared in a Republican
National platform: "That, while providing
revenue for the support of the General
Government by duties on imports, sound
policy requires such an adjustment of
these imports as to encourage the de
velopment of the industrial interests of
the whole country." This declaration
was made by the Republican National
Convention in 1860. yy.
But before the Republican Convention
of 1860 met a measure passed the House
which Was discussed oftener and longer in
the coming years than any other act of its
class ever placed on the National statute
book. This was the Morrill tariff. It re
ceived this name from Justin S. Morrill, a
member of the sub-committee of the Ways
and Means Committee, who reported the
bill and who took a prominent part in
framing it:/. The object of the bill was
revenue and incidental protection, both of
which were assailed by the law of 1857.
"The Morrill tariff bill," said an eminent
statesman, then and still in Congress,
"came nearer than any other to meeting the
double requirements of providing ample
revenue for the support of the Govern
ment and of rendering the proper protec
tion to home industries." (John Sher
man, in "Recollections of For'y Years,"
vol. I, p. 188.)
â -, The Morrill tariff bill passed the House,
in which the Republicans had a plurality,
on May 11. 1860, by a vote of 105 to 64, but
it was obstructed in the Democratic Sen
ate untils after the withdrawal of many
Southern t members on the secession of
their States, when it went through that
body by a vote of 25 to 14, on February 20,
1861, .and was signed by President Bu
chanan on March 2.
The act changed, as far as practicable,
the ad valorem rates of the tariff of 1857 to
the specific form, ana advanced most of
them. The principal increase was on iron
and wool and the products of each. At
the â¢ time when it . was framed-, however,
there was no ;â¢ serious expectation of war,
and it proved inadequate for the revenue
demands which the creation and support
of large â  armies and a ; strong navy en
tailed. y Mr. y Morrill ji estimated that it
would produce $65,000,000 a * year, which
would be sufficient for the' requirements of
peace, but which was far below the needs
of war even in the first six. months of the
conflict. -â â /â¢';
- Every, possible source of revenue was
utilized during war, and the tariff, as
a consequence, was changed often, usually,
of course, increased. The tariff was
changed more than forty times between
March' 2, 1861, and March 3, 1883. the i eh?
i tire series acts and modification of acts
except that of 1883, which made a general
revision of the entire list of duties and in?
I ternal taxes, being j known jas the ; Morrill
tariff. August 5, 1861, during the extra
i session',- the first change was had. It made
an advance on most of the rates estab
lished on March 2 of that year, and added
some commodities to the dutiable list. An
internal revenue act was passed f July 1,
1562. putting a tax on many articles of
home production, and tbe articles and the
rates were often increased in the next few
years. Taxation of incomes began with
an act of August S. 1861, and. with many
changes,, was continued until 1872. when it
was abolished. "'
The downward tendency in internal Â»nd
external taxation began soon after the
close of | the war. The reduction in j inter
nal taxes began in 1866, and continued to
1683, the act of f Marcti 3 of that year cut
ting the imposts spirits, * fermented
liquors, tobacco, and bank circulation, to
which, in , 1886, oleomargarine was added.
A decided downward tendency in 5 duties
began with the law of July 14, 1870, affect
ing many articles. Tea and coffee were
placed "on" the free list May 1, 1872, and
June 1, 1872, a cut of 10 per cent in duties
was made on most of the commodities on
the tariff schedules, while July 1, 1879, qui
uine was made free. V'
Before the latter date, however, an up
ward swing in duties set in. The panic of
1873 reducing the Government's. income,
the 10 per cent cut from the duties in 1872
was restored March 3, 1875. A few
changes, generally of minor importance,
were made in the next few years, and on
March 3, 1883, an act based in a general
way on a report of the tariff commission
appointed by President Arthur was signed.
The desire of the com mission was to re
duce the average duties about 20 per cent,
but the cut made by the law did not reach
this figure.- The treasury surplus or ex
cess of receipts over ordinary expendi
tures, which amounted to $100,000,000 in
the fiscal year 1881, $145,000,000 in 1882
and $133,000,000 in 1883, dictated the re
duction in the last-named year. This isa
rapid survey of the changes in the tariff
and internal taxes from the beginning of
the war down to 1883.
In dealing with the finances the Repub
lican party; during the war period was
forced to create an immense debt, which it
refunded at lower rates of interest after
ward and then reduced to comparatively
small figures/An enumeration of the suc
cessive loans, with their varying periods
and interest rates, would be tedious, and
the matter will be touched on here in only
its larger features. On March 31, 1865, the
Government's obligations reached their
highest mart:,, which, in round figures,
was $2,846,000,000. Of this amount $2,381,
-000,000 bore $830,000,000 of it at
7 3-10 per cent. $1,282,000,000 at 6 per cent,
and $269,000,000 at 5 per cent. The annual
interest charge at that date was $151,000,
-000. vy
By successive refunding schemes the in
terest rate was cut to lower figures, and
through excess of revenue over expendi
ture the debt was for years steadiiy and
rapidly reduced. In 1891-94 the interest
bearing debt was at its lowest since 1862,
$585,000,000, and consisted of $560,000,000 of
4 per cent bonds and $25,000,000 of 4% per
cents continued at 2 percent. The an
nual interest charge at the time was $23,
-000,000. The interest-bearing debt started
upward in 1894. Through successive bond
sales by President Cleveland the debt was
increased $50,000,000 in February, 1894, and
$50,000,000 in November of that year, and
at the rate of 5 per cent, aiid $63,000,000 in
February, 1895, and j $100,000,009 in Febru
ary, 1896, all at the rate of 4 per cent.
As part of the same i' scheme to provide
money for the Government, which it did
through the sale of bonds, the National
banking system was created. At the be
ginning of 186T there were about 1600 banks
in the country operating under the widely
different laws of the several States, which
banks had a circulation of about $200,000,
-000. This comprised the greater part of the
country's currency, and these institutions
had about $116,0011,000 specie, principally
of gold, against this currency and their
other liabilities. The banks suspended
specie payments December 28, 1861, and
the Government did likewise on J anuary 1,
1862. On repeated recommendations from
Secretary Chase a banking system based,
in some of its features, on the scheme in
vogue in the State of New York was
adopted. When first proposed in 1861
Samuel Hooper of Massachusetts was
almost its only, outspoken friend In the
House, and John Sherman was one or its
earliest and most active friends in the Sen
ate. : It did not go through Congress until
a year after the first greenback bill was
enacted. In the Senate the vote was 23
(twenty-two Republicans and one Demo
crat) for to 21 (fourteen Democrats and
seven Republicans) against, and in the
House the vote was 78 (seventy-six Repub
licans and two Democrats) for to 68 (thir
ty-nine Democrats and twenty-five Repub
licans) against the bill. The bill was
signed by President Lincoln . on February
25, 1863. On May 3, 1865, an net was passed
taxing the notes of State banks 10 percent,
wiping out that element of the currency.
As modified at different times, the bank
ing system created by the act of 1863 has
been in operation ever since.

Edward McPherson of Pennsylvania says, j
Edward McPherson of Pennsylvania says,
in his review of "The Rise and Progress of \
the Republican Party," that "it is a sug- â¢
gestive and mortifying yet actual fact that
the Democratic Senators and Representa
tives in Congress were arrayed in almost j
solid opposition to all the tariff and in
ternal revenue legislation of 1881-62 and
1864. '.
"Likewise, they were unwilling to assist
in establishing the National banking sys
tem in 1863. The act was proposed and
passed, not at all as a favor to the banks,
but as an aid to the United States. It goes
without saying that the Democracy, 'in
Congress and out of it, were in no mood to
oppose such a measure. They violently
disapproved it. Opposing it ' mode com
plete their opposition ; to all the great tax
and money measures of that period."
In another passage the '- resumption of
specie payments is thus described: "When
Mr. Tilden wrote of what would be the in
evitable failure of resumption N under - the
act of 1875, the greenback dollar was worth

LOOK ON THIS SIDE,
THEN ON THAT -THE PLATFORMS
OF THE TWO PARTIES.
The parallel column is herewith employed to present handily, for reference and
comparison, sample planks from the platforms adopted respectively by the Republican
and Democratic parties, assembled in National convention f rom 1856 to 1892, inclusive
of Doth years. In 1856 public affairs were rapidly, approaching a crisis.- The issue
before the people was â  the extension of slavery into tho Territories, and thi3 was so
sharply defined as to furnish the incentive for, and to give birth to, the Republican
party as a National organization, and on this issue the first campaign was made.
There were constitutional questions concerning the' status of the Federal Government
in relation to the States in their individual capacity. These were considered oy both
the Republicans and the Democrats, and the platforms of 1856 touched on the Govern
ment's prerogatives. The main resolutions adopted in 1856 only are presented for re
view for that year, and this rule has been followed in selections from succeeding plat
forms up to and including 1892, the idea being to give the spirit of the time.
In 1860 the issue was the same as in 1856. Four years later the conduct of the war
was the subject of controversy between the two great parties. Then in 1868 the terms
and details of the work of reconstruction furnished platform material.
An anomalous condition of affairs existed in 1872. lhe Republican National Con
vention declared strongly in favor of the amendments to the Federal Constitution,
which were intended to < secure such political rights, to the freedmen of the South as
were enjoyed by the white voters of that section. The Republican party of the North
was not thoroughly. agreed and the Liberal Republican movement came into the polit
ical arena and selected Horace Greeley as its' standard-bearer. The platform adopted
by the Liberal Republicans approved of the war for the Union, etc. The Democrats
were forced by the logic of the situation to take up Greeley as their candidate,, and as
the Presidential candidate and the platform could not very well be separated, the
Democrats adopted with ' Greeley, for campaign purposes only, a code of . principles
which they disapproved. The tariff issue came to the front in the Republican plat
form of 1876. The -Democrats attacked the Republicans for failure to bring about the
resumption of specie payments up to that date. '. \):'. Y ''â '. '".
The tariff was fairly considered in 1880 by both parties, and both put themselves
squarely on the, record. The Republicans declared for a tariff which should "so dis
criminate as to favor American labor," while the Democratic National Convention set
their "mark' at "a tariff for revenue only." This has been reiterated, in â¢varying
phrase but with the same intent, in each succeeding campaign. The Democratic
National Convention of 1892 denounced "Republican protection as a fraud." The
comparative texts tell their own story adequately. ..'â¢',-. â¢'.. â  â¢ 'â./ V-
REPUBLICAN 1856 ..DEMOCRATIC
I As our Republican fathers, when they had
abolished slavery in all our National territory,
ordained that no person should be deprived of
life, liberty or property without due process of
law, it becomes our duty to maintain this pro
vision of the constitution against all attempts
to violate It for the purpose of establishing
slavery in any territory of the United States
by positive legislation prohibiting Its exist
ence or extension therein. '
REPUBLICAN 1860 DEMOCRATIC
The Federal constitution, the rights of the
States and the union of the States must and
shall be preserved.
The normal condition of all the territory of
the* United States is that of freedom. We deny
the authority of Congress, of a territorial leg
islature or of individuals to give legal exist
ence to slavery in any territory of the United
States.

We pledge ourselves, as Union men, ani
mated by a common sentiment and aiming at

against Its authority.
As slavery was the cause and now consti
tutes the strength of this rebellion, and as it
must be always and everywhere hostile to the
principles of Republican government, justice
and the N ational safety demand its utter and
complete extirpation from the soil Of the Re
public.
REPUBLICAN 1868 DEMOCRATIC
We congratulate the country on the assured
success of the reconstruction policy of Con
gress, as evinced by the adoption, in a ma
jority of the States lately in rebellion, of con
stitutions securing equal civil rights to all.
No citizen of the United States, native or
naturalized must be liable to arrest and im
prisonment, by any foreign power, for acts
done or words spoken In this country.
The bounties and pensions provided by the
laws for those brave defenders of the Nation,
are obligations never to be forgotten.
REPUBLICAN 1872 DEMOCRATIC
The recent amendments tothe National con
stitution should be cordially sustained be
cause they are right; not merely tolerated be
cause they are law, and should be carried out
according to their spirit by appropriate legis
lation.
REPUBLICAN 1876 DEMOCRATIC
The revenue necessary lor current expendi

must be largely derived from duties upon im

adjusted to promote the interests of American
labor and advance the prosperity of the whole
country. "/
REPUBLICAN 1880 DEMOCRATIC
We affirm the belief avowed in 1876, that
the duties levied for the purpose of revenue
so should discriminate as to favor American
labor.
REPUBLICAN. ...1884.......... DEMOCRATIC
It is the first duty of a good government to
protect the rights and promote the interests of
its own people. The largest diversity of in
dustry is the most productive of general pros
perity and of the comfort and independence
of the people. We therefore demand that the
Imposition of duties on foreign Imports shall
be : made, not for revenue only, but that in
raising the requisite revenues for the Govern
ment, such duty shall be so levied as to afford
security to our diversified industries and pro
tection to the rights and wages of the laborer,
to trie cud that active and intelligent labor; as
well as capital, may have its reward and
the laboring man hit full share in the National
prosperity./:.-;:-;:

We reaffirm the American doctrine of pro-
tection. We call attention to its growth'
abroad. We maintain that the prosperous con-
dition of our country is largely due' to the wise
revenue legislation of the /Republican Con-
gress. We believe ; that all articles which can
. not "be produced In the United i States, except
luxuries, be admitted free of duty, and
that on all imports coming lato competition
, with American labor : there * should be levied -
duties equal to the difference between wages
abroad and "at home. We assert that the prices
of manufactured \ articles of general consump
tion have been reduced under tbe operations

The Democratic party will resist all attempts
at renewing in Concrcss, or out of it. the agi

The Federal Government is one of limited

NEW YORK'S MANY
POLITICAL FEUDS.
Some of the Great Quar
rels Between Gotham's
Party Leaders.
Conkling's Sarcastic Shafts and
Blame's Model of Exco
riation.
Greeley's Difference With Thurlow
Weed and William H. Seward.
Grant and Bristow.
Although the South and West have con
tributed their quota, New York can Justly
lay claim to the greater number of polit
ical feuds, pursued as relentlessly as the
Corsican vendetta. The whole country is
familiar with the story of the great Whig-
Republican triumvirate composed of Will
iam H. Seward, Thurlow Weed and Horace
Greeley. These three men worked together
as radical Whigs until 1854, when the junior
member of the firm withdrew, accusing his
partners of sacrificing him to their lust of
power. The friends of Seward maintain
that Greeley seceded from the alliance be
cause he was disappointed as an office
seeker, but whatever the real cause suffice
it that Horace, the editor and spokesman
of the plain people, nursed .grievances
and redressed them too, for, like bis
former partners, he went into the young
Republican party and achieved a leader
ship that was national in its importance
and influence. Seward and Weed, how
ever, obtained control of the party ma
chinery, and although they consented to
allow Greeley to lead forlorn hopes they
balked his plans whenever success seemed
probable.
Greeley was very anxious to go as a dele
gate to the National Republican Conven
tion in 1860, but Seward interposed and he
was defeated. At that time Greeley was
opposed to Seward, but his friends say
that he would have contented himself
with registering his vote against the New
York leader if he had been permitted to
attend as a representative from his own
State. Indignant at the treatment ac
corded to him he went to Chicago and was
substituted for an absent Oregon delegate.
His newspaper had given him a National
fame, and as a proxy for this Western ab
sentee he undermined the works thrown
up by Seward and did more than any other
man to secure the nomination of Abraham
Lincoln.
The difference between Grant and Bris
tow can scarcely be called a feud. Benja
min H. Bristow was nominated for Attor
ney-General by the soldier-President in
1873. but powerful agencies secured his re
jection. Grant was bent on honoring the
Kentuckian, and he named him for Secre
tary of the Treasury on June 3, 1874.
Shortly afterward the war on the Whisky
Ring was inaugurated, and, although Bris
tow waG the moving spirit in the prosecu
| tions, many claimed that he was only an
agent of the President. About this time
insinuations began to crop out in the
newspapers that Grant was protecting the
whisky men, and the friends of the Presi
dent attributed these attacks to followers
of Bristow, if he himself were not directly
responsible. These charges were indig
nantly denied by the men affected, but
certain it 13 that the friction grew, and
after the ring was broken up in June, 1876,
Bristow retired from the Cabinet, osten
sibly to attend to private business, but
really, it is said, to wage war against the
antagonistic influences in the party. He
was a candidate for the Presidential
nomination that year, backed by the re
form element in bis party, but he mus
tered merely a respectable following.
Hayes was nominated, and Bristow began
the practice of law in New York City.
An Ohio feud that has attracted consid
erable attention was fought out between
Allen Granby Thurman and Henry B.
Payne. This led to the celebrated Coal-
Oil-Rag-Baby campaigns. Thurman had
had undisputed swing in Buckeye Dem
ocratic politics after the war, and he
might have retained this ascendency had
he not advocated fiat money and joined
the forces of greenback Democracy. His
opponents have always claimed that his
financial views were responsible for the
challenge to his leadership, but his friends
maintain that the great corporations that
bad been brought to book in the United
States Senate furnished the sinews of war
for his enemies. Be that as it may, from
tbe date of Henry B. Payne's entrance
into Congress a fierce war was waged for
supremacy in the party.
It has been held that this fight insured
the retirement of Thurman from the Sen
ate and the election of James A. Garfield
in his place, and four years later Henry B.
Payne was made a United States Senator.
.Now comes the most bitter political
feud in the history of American politics.
When Ira Harris retired from the United
States Senate his seat was taken. by Ros
coe Conkling, a great man, proud to a
fault, generous to his friends, and a foe
to be feared. He was the intimate friend
of Grant, and one of his most trusted
counselors. Just as Conkling' 3 star began
to shine with National brilliancy, James
G. Blame was attracting the attention of
the whole country. These two men had
served in the lower bouse together, but
they represented opposing interests in the
party, and were personally uncongenial. '
Conkling, great in many ways, could
not resist tbe temptation of sending sar
castic B'nafts at the Speaker whenever oc
casion offered, and Blame answered in
kind. The final clash came over the case
of General Frye, who had incurred the
enmity of the Senator from New York,
and the latter worked hard to secure his
dismissed from the service. With
. that generous ' desire to help the
under dog, which was one 'of w Mr.
Blame's noblest characteristics,", he took
up the cudgels for the . friendless but
gallant Frye, whose , character was vindi
cated by . the War Department in ; three
well-deserved promotions within a short
space of time. â 'â¢'â¢â â :'
In the course of the fight over this case
Blame, stung to the quick by an ungener
ous and just taunt of his New York en
ergy, burst ; forth into y that terrific on
slaught which stupefied they Speaker,
wrought the , House into a â  high pitch of
excitement and marked the beginning of a
fierce struggle in the Republican party
â  that ended in the humiliation of Roscoe
Conkling and the defeat of James G.
Blame for President of the United States.
Here are the words and they are charged
with ridicule and are a model of excoria
tion I^o^*^^^S^ffmW^l^^g^llf^fi
"As to the gentleman's cruel sarcasm, I
hope he will not be too severe. The con
tempt of that large-minded gentleman is
so wilting, his haughty disdain, his gran
diloquent swell, his majestic, superemi
nent, overpowering turkey-gobbler strut
bas been so crushing to myself and all the
members of this House that I know it was
an act of â  the greatest temerity for me to
venture upon a controversy with him."
Referring then to a chance newspaper
comparison of Mr. Conkling to Henry
Winter Davis (which he interpreted sar
castically), he continued:
"The gentleman took it seriously, and it
has given his strut additional pomposity.
The resemblance is great, it is striking.
Hyperion to a satyr, Tht-rsites to Hercules,
mud to marble, dunghill to diamond, a
singed cat to a Bengal tiger, a whining
puppy to a roaring lion. Shade of the
mighty Davis, forgive the almost profana
tion of that jocose sat* re.
After this there was no chance of recon
ciliation, and the battle was to the death.
Defeated in 1876 and â¢ threatened with de
feat in 1880, Blame sent his men to the
standard of, Garfield, who was elected.
/ wish to emphasize my understanding
of the position of the Republican party
upon this questionâ that it favors such
a system of revenue as respects foreign
imports, as will discriminate in favor
of our laborers and against laborers pro
ducing the same â  things in other countries.
The position of the Senators from Missouri
and Illinois favors the unimpeded importa
tion of these competing articles without re
straint and without limitation. A wayfar
ing man can see that if that is done it will
be but a brief space when our laborers will be
reduced to the level of the laborers of other
countries.- WILLIAM B. ALLISON.
CONVENTIONS AT ST. LOUIS.
Although This Has Been Her Greatest
Year, the City Has Had Many
Gatherings.
Although the year 1896 is the greatest
convention year St. Louis has ever had,
the city has entertained an immense num
ber of National Conventions of different
character during the last thirty years.
Between 1866 and 1876 St, Louis had three
conventions â River Convention in 1867;
National Commercial Convention in 1872;
National Railroad Convention in 1875.
In 1876 the National Democratic Conven
tion was held in St. Louis, the Merchants'
Exchange.Hall being fitted up for the pur
pose. The Exchange floor made . a very
excellent Convention Hall. The dimen-
sions are very generous. It is 221 feet long,
about 100 feet wide and nearly 80 feet
! igh. In 1881 another important River
Convention was held, and since then
the cattlemen, who electrified the public
with their "Cowboy Millionaire Band,"
the National Medical Convention, the
Knights' Templars' Triennial Conclave,
the Bicycle-makers' Convention and the
Grand Army Encampment have been held
there.
In 1888 the National Democratic Nom
inating Convention was again held in St.
Louis. It was preceded by the Saencer
fest. For this gathering the north nave of
the Exposition building was rearranged
and converted into an auditorium, with
seats, platforms and appurtenances. The
local committee of the Democratic con
vention arranged to secure the use of tbe
fixtures, and the Democratic convention
was held in the hall. The arrangements
generally were satisfactory, but the acous
tics were - admittedly bad. It will be re
membered that it was proposed to hold the
Republican convention this year in the
north nave, but to fit it up in a much-more
satisfactory manner. It' was found, how
ever, that it would be necessary to make
a number of structural alterations at a
heavy expense with very doubtful results,
and hence the building of the Convention
Auditorium on the south half of the old
Washington Park.
In 1889 there were several comparatively
small conventions, and it was not untii
toward the end of the year that National
gatherings of magnitude were held. â¢' The
Silver Convention in the Exposition Build
ing in November, and the Farmers' Alli
ance Convention the following week, were
the most largely attended of gatherings
of this kind during the year. In 1890 the
Ancient Order of United Workmen held
their convention in St. Louis, and in June
the Young People's Society of Christian
Endeavor held a very large gathering. ' In
the following year there . were a great
number of conventions, the most impor
tant gathering being the meeting of the
Sovereign Grand Lodge of Odd. Fellows,
with representatives from all parts of the
United States and Canada.
In 1892 no effort was made to secure
either of the great National Nominating
Conventions. During the spring the Peo
ple's party held a conference which was
really of greater importance than its con
vention. Other conventions and annual
meetings held during the year included j
the Nicaragua Canal Convention, the Re
union of the Army of the Tennessee, and
National conventions of agricultural im
plement makers, electricians, florists,
builders, canners and others. The Elec
trical Convention attracted exceptional
interest, and Tesla's demonstrations at
tracted such an immense throng
to i the Exposition building that great
difficulty was experienced in handling the
crowds.
In 1893 the Interstate Sunday-school
Convention was held in the Exposition
building, followed by large gatherings of
the German benevolent societies,
Southern wholesale grocers and other or
ganizations. Last year the American In
stitute of Architects and the National
Music Teachers' Association ; held their
annual conventions in St. Louis. This
year the conventions of importance, which
commence with the Republican National
Convention, include conventions" of, the
People's party, the Silver party, the Direct
Legislation League, the International Co
operation Congress, the Knights of Friend
ship, the Knights of Father Mathew, the
American Bankers' Association, the Na
tional Association of Democratic Clubs,
the National Vehicle Builders' Associa
tion, the American Street Railway
Association, the Women's . Christian
Temperance Union and some five or six
others. ' :::' :Y- 'â '.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 19, IROfi.
THE FAMILIES OF
THE PRESIDENTS.
Many Chief Executives
Were Not Blessed
With Sons.
Martin Van Buren's Son Became
Famous as "Prince
y, John." /
He Danced With the Queen of Great
Britainâ The Distinguished
Tylers.
The fact that the incumbent . of the j ex
ecutive chair of the Nation is the; father
of three daughters calls to mind that the
descendants of America's chief executives
are nearly all girls.
Jefferson, Monroe, Fillmore and John
son were blessed only \ with daughters,
and a number of the early Presidents who
hoped for an extended family tree were
sorely disappointed. y A ",y
During the social seaspn just ended, the
daughters of three Presidents of the
United States met at a reception in Wash
ington. They were Mrs. Sartoris, daughter
of General Grant; Mrs. Stanley Brown,
daughter of Garfield, and Mrs. McKee,
daughter of Benjamin Harrison, */<"?
It is a somewhat remarkable fact that
the chief magistrates of the Nation had
few male children, and those who had sons
were bereaved of them early in life. Presi
dent Buchanan was a bachelor, Pierces
two children, both boys, died before they
reached their maturity. Two sons of Abra
ham Lincoln died young, leaving Robert,
who also lost a son, but has another one
living. Benjamin Harrison's son has a
daughter, and his daughter has a son, but
there is no male child to perpetuate his
name.
The first President of this Republic,
George Washington, was without male is
sue, and so anxious was he to give life to
the Washington family tree that he
adopted the grandchildren of his wife,
whose family name was Custis. But even
his adopted son had no male child, and
his daughter was married to General Rob
ert E. Lee. Washington's brothers had
sons galore, and their children and chil
dren's children are scattered throughout
the Old Dominion and other parts of the
United States. . * ;
The Adamses were more fortunate, and
maintained their place in politics and his
tory through many male members. John
Quincy Adams' son was Minister to Eng
land during the Civil War, and was a can-
didate for Presidential honors. Charles
Francis Adams had four sons, two of whom
served in the late war. One of them was
twice nominated for Governor of Massa
chusetts, another is now Mayor of Quincy,
Mass., and a third of Boston â Josiah
Quincy. . . *, ." . '/â¢'
Jefferson had four daughters to perpet
uate his race, but the name so far as bis
own individual family tree is concerned
died out. y;y: .- , Â«
When Aaron Burr brought James Madi-
[ son to see Dorothea Payne Todd at her
home in Philadelphia she was a widow
with one child, who in manhood was
rather wild. James Madison and Dolly
Todd were married, and when he attained
the pinnacle of his ambition in his election
to the Presidency the wife of the chief ex-
ecutive gave her social powers full swing
and changed the even tone of Jefferson
simplicity to more luxurious ways. But
no son came â to bless the union, and the
disappointment was all the greater to the
mother at least, for her own son, Payne
Todd, had gone to the bad. ' * â¢ -.' r *
James Monroe and his wife had no sons.
Of their two daughters one was named
for the Queen of Holland, Hortense Beau-
harnais, with whom Eliza Monroe had
been in school in Paris while her father
was United States Minister there. The
second daughter married a member of the
famous Gouverneur family in New York.
Monroe died in their house after he had
lost his fortune.
Andrew Jackson's romantic union with
Mrs. Robards, which followed upon a sen-
sational suit for divorce by her husband,
was also sonless. This circumstance greatly
embittered Jackson's life. He had made
many sacrifices for the woman he loved,
fighting a duel with Dickinson on account
of casting insinuations against her charac
ter. Deprived of parental' hope, Jackson
adopted a boy, to whom he gave his name.
This adopted son married Sarah Yorke.
fhe result of the union was a son, who be-
came a colonel in the Confederate army.
The young lady whom he called daughter,
and who presided at the White House after
the death of his wife, was his niece Emily.
Martin Van Buren was one of the excep
tions to the line of sonless Presidents. His
four sons took up their residence with him
in the Executive Mansion. The one that
was known as "Prince John" â¢ became a
famous man. y, - â¢ â  fi
During a visit to London he attended a
grand ball at Buckingham Palace, and
danced with the * young Queen \ Victoria.
This gave rise to a proposal of a union be-
tween the English Queen and an American
Prince. His title of "Prince John" stuck
to him from that time on. Some of : the
descendants of Van Buren went to Paris
and died, while quite a number of them
reside in New York, South Carolina and
other States. V
When President Benjamin Harrison vis-
ited San Francisco in 1891 his son Russell
and : the - younger members : of * the Presi
dential party were entertained by the Bo-
hemian Club, and. in presenting Russell to
the company the chairman of the evening
facetiously remarked that the young man
would never attain greatness, as Provi

in bestowing its honors on the Harrison
family. This allusion to the fact that
Benjamin 'Harrison was the grandson of
William Henry Harrison, r although it
pointed ;' out ' ; great promise yof "Baby"
McKee, was not so apt as it seemed to be
to the Bohemians and the guests, for John
Scott Harrison, the son of William Henry,
and the father of Benjamin, was a man of
some prominence "and* served his native
State ,of Indiana in i Congress during . the
'50's. William Henry, John Scott ' and
Benjamin, the Presidential; line, were all
of the Western branch of the family, while
the Virginia Harrisons, who reside in the
neighborhood of -.the old paternal estate,
Berkeley, near ; the banks of I the James,
and elsewhere in the Dominion, are
descended from the first Benjamin, a signer
of i the 'â , Declaration of ' Independence and

" John Tyler was married twice, ana seve
ral children were born to him, some of
whom are living to-day. The Tyler fam
ily is considered the most f illustrious in
this country, for with its Monroe and Har
rison connections it has produced four
Presidents.
John Tyler's romantic marriage to Julia
Gardiner of Gardiners : Island, while he
was still ' President, was fruitful of chil
dren. One of these is Lyon Gardiner
Tyler, president of William and Mary
College. His brother, Dr. Gardiner Tyler,
represents the Second District of Virginia
in Congress. y? Dr. Lachland Tyler is * a
physician in New York.
President ; Polk had no children, and
Zachary Taylor, who Â» followed him. lost
his only son by death. \ His eldest daugh
ter married Senator Jefferson Davis, and
Winnie Davis,' the Daughter of the Con
federacy, is Zachary Taylor's grandchild.
His daughter Betty contracted two mar
riages, one with Major W. 8. Bliss. While
married to him she became mistress of the
White House, tatting upon v herself j the
duties which her mother found too diffi
cult to perform.'
- Millard Fillmore's career was full of
sadness. His wife died three weeks after
he entered the White House, and a year
later he lost his only daughter.
Franklin Pierces residence in the White
House was also sad and lonely. Two of
his sons died In early youth, and the third
was killed In a railroad accident two
months before his father's inauguration. ,
Abraham Lincoln bad three sons when
he took up the reins of government upon
the retirement of the bachelor President,
Buchanan. Of these Robert Tod Lincoln
survives. three sons of Andrew John
son are dead, while the Grant children are
all alive.- â  ' :'-:^v'yy
Rutherford B. Hayes' residence in the
White House was blessed with unusual
calm. Happiness and health attended his
four years of government. v '"!
Following in the footsteps of his father
is James Rudolph Garfield. On the four
teenth anniversary of the day on which
Guiteau shot his father down in the
Pennsylvania Railroad station in Wash
ington he was nominated for State Sen
ator from the district in which a similar
honor was conferred on James Abram
Garfield in 1859. Young Garfield is now
a member of that body and looks forward
to a nomination for Congress. He and
his elder brother, Harry, who confines bis
attention to politics in the municipal
field, are practicing law in Cleveland,
although James still retains the old home
stead at Mentor as a residence. Miss Belle
H. Mason was married to Harry Garfield
in 1888, and two years later the marriage
of James Garfield and Miss Helen Newell
took place.
The Garfield grandchildren number ten.
Harry has j three sons and a daughter
James, born October 28, 1889; Mason, Oc
tobers, 1892; Lucretia, January 18, 1894,
and Stanton, August 3, 1895. The three
children of James Garfield are John How

child of the muraered President, and a
nephew and a niece were born on August 3.

CAMPAIGN BALLADS
OF YORE-RHYMES THAT AWAKEN
OLD-TIME MEMORIES.
In the early days of the Republican party the campaign poet was strongly in evi
dence and produced words fitted to popular tunes. One poet distinguished himself by
producing a parody on â¢â¢Villikinsand His Dinah," .which ran this way:

The preceding was sung with a will under the title of "Old Abe's. Preliminary
Visit to the White House."
Then there was another, which was a parody on "There Was an Old Darky
Whose Name Was Uncle Ned," that ran like this: .
Dere was a Uttie man and his name was Stevy Dug,

AIDED AMERICAN SHIPPING
Under a Protective Tariff Commerce
by Sea Thrived and
Prospered.
"If the shipping in our foreign trade had
grown in proportion to the increase of the
Cargoes provided by our foreign com
merce," says Congressman Dingley
of Maine in an . . article concern
ing the American merchant marine,
"we should have bad a most magnificent
fleet of vessels engaged in transporting
our exports and imports. The difficulty
has not been in a want of cargoes, but in
the fact that foreign rather than
American vessels have taken these
cargoes, simply because our ves
sels could not successfully compete with
foreign vessels, which have all been ad
mitted to participate in the carrying of
our exports and imports on equal terms
with our own vessels since January 1, 1850,
when the United States entered into re
ciprocal maritime arrangements with Great
Britain.
â¢â¢This brings out the fact that while on
the one band our thoroughly protected
merchant marine in the coastwise trade
has prospered because it has not been ,
brought into competition with foreign yes- <
sels, on the other hand our shipping in
tbe foreign trade, which has been brought;
into free and open competition with for-
eign vessels since 1850, has been gradually
driven from tne ocean. In other words,
protectionâ protection to the extent of
prohibition of foreign competition â has
saved our shipping in the coastwise trade,
and made it the most magnificent home
I fleet in the world; while free trade in the
1 business of carrying our exports and im
â  ports has well-nigh ruined every Ameri-
can ship-master and ship-owner in this
trade. y.-^' "itj* "-'â 
"A more complete demonstration of the
wisdom, aye, the necessity of protecting
all our industries against free competition
of similar foreign industries employing
cheaper labor could not be had. Free
trade as a theory seems very plausible.
on paper; free trade in its practical re-
sults may be seen by any one who looks
for the American merchant marine in tbe
foreign carrying trade, which has been
struggling against foreign competion on
free-trade principles for over thirty years.
"The decline of our merchant marine in
the foreign trade is a humiliating fact
which has justly attracted widespread at
tention within a few years, and has caused
an earnest discussion of the causes and
the remedies which should be applied to
recover our -position in the deep sea carry-
ing trade.
"This topic is rarely alluded to by a free-
trader in or out of Congress without the
j assertion that the decline is the direct re
: suit of the national protective policy of the
country adopted by the Republican party
in 1861 and maintained since that
period, and the additional declaration
that up to 1861. when the revenue tariff
policy. the Democratic party was over
thrown, our merchant marine was experi
encing great and increasing prosperity.
"The conclusive reply to this free-trade
assumption is that the decline of our for
eign carrying trade, as the official figures
already given show,' did not commence
with the adoption of the protective tariff."MILITARY DAY AT SANTA CRUZ.

PRETTY BABIES IN FLOWER-DECKED
Handsome Women and Happy Men at the
Grand Ball Given by Her Majesty
Queen Josephine to Her
Loyal Subjects.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., June 18.â The sun
by day and the moon by night danced at
tendance upon Queen Josephine during
this second series of events of the great
Venetian Water Carnival.
The great audiences that witnessed the
various features were happy all day long,
and at night found added pleasure at the
arena and in the grand ball-room.
â¢ It was long after midnight and almost
time to introduce the third day's events
before the people seemed satisfied to quit
the presence of their Queen or leave the
interesting, things that were a source of
attraction. . Daylight's hours were de
voted to pleasure, and throughout the
night could be heard the sound of laughter
and song from groups of persons filled
with the enthusiasm of the occasion.
The spirit of the music at the arena, the
brightness of the fireworks, which to-night
seemed to excel those of last night, and
the echo of the singing clubs' merry songs
on the river, combined to make the clos
ing of the night of the second day one
that will be long remembered.
Tbis afternoon, as she rode through the
city in a canopied carrriage drawn by
four beautiful horses, Queen Josephine
was escorted by 300 blue jackets from the
Philadelphia and Monadnock, headed by
the battalion band and by the Watsonville
Drill Corps with its band. Immediately
preceding Queen Josephine! and her
maids of honor and pages, was Ronco
vieri'sband. â  -/ - *â¢-,â ;â .!-'
The queen was attended by Admiral
Beardslee and his staff, Captain Cotton of
the Philadelphia and Captain Sumner of
the Monadnock and their chief officers.
Director-General Bowman and the carni
val officers, with ' Mayor Clark and Judge
Logan, rode in the rear of the carnages oc
cupied by the naval officers. The city and
county officials followed, and marked the
line between the dignified military and
the picturesque arid romantic civilians.
The carnival parade was a mile in length
and presented numbers of picturesque and
unique ideas. Every feature was a de
cidedly attractive one and no float or com
pany of actors in the procession could
have been improved upon in the slightest
degree. No addition to that long line of
white battalions, blue-coated drill corps or
floral floats would have made it any more
enjoyable. It was a very pretty proces
sion, having dignity in, its bearing and
romance in its construction, as the thou
sands of people on the streets attested by
their approving applause.
There were not so many school children
in the parade as there were out of it. Pro
fessor Clark urged all the pupils in the
public schools to join in the pageant, but
most of them expressed a preference for '
making the very best possible use of their
vacation time and went to see the show in
stead of becoming a part of it.
The little ones who took part enjoyed it
and did themselves great honor and their
teachers great credit by their appearance.
They were generously applauded by their
schoolmates, who were among the specta- j
tors. â -...-

SCENE IN THE BALLROOM AT THE SANTA CRUZ CARNIVAL.
The celling of this vast room was of a vari-colored net Intertwined with bright bunting. All over
the surface of it thousands of fresh roses were sewn, producing a most pleasing and harmonious effect.
The pillars down the sides of the hall were wrapped with colored bunting and trimmed with bows of
ribbon. ' .'*â¢â .' - â  , .* "
horses in their silver ] trappings drew a
cart that carried three prettily dressed
young ladies, and seemed to enter into
the carnival spirit. ' â  -X .;* -.*-,;â¢
- little tots who gained honorable
mention made the most unique showing
in all that grand parade. Little Rosalie
Bernheim rode i like a little queen in her
pony-cart, with Eddy Morgan driving the
bit of horsefleshâ one of the smallest Shet
land ponies that was ever attired in har
ness. Little Rosalie is a pretty child, and
the artifice of the decorator was expended
on the cart, which was transformed into a
concha shell of carnival colors. The high
silk hat and livery worn by Master Mor
gan enhanced the .attractiveness of the
unique and pretty turnout.
"The, Yale tots," as they are Known,
Alba, Myrtle and Elmer, also secured hon
orable mention. They drove their great
Newfoundland dog, attached to a cart
tnnt was a picture in yellow and white.
The dog is a noble fellow who should have
gained a prize himself. y !*v;^
'The buttercup design that carried the
queen of , the Grant school, and the â pony
cart that carried the queen of the Laurel
school also carried away honors for their
appearance. : ':- ' .
The judges were C. F. Taylor of San
Francisco, Jerome Case Bull of New. York
and W. H. Dunphy of San J Mateo. y They
received many congratulations for the ex
cellent judgment they displayed.
The Watsonville Drill Corps has become
quite expert in sword exercises under the
careful instructions of Colonel Koster. It
followed closely in the rear of the white
battalion, and seemed to be affected by the
dignity of the sailor soldiers, for: it re
served its evolutions for the night per
formance on the queen's dancing floor.
The accuracy of the marching was quite
noticeable, and gave the 'â¢ spectators some
intimation of what these gentlemen, most
of whom are members of y the Watsonville
fire department, can accomplish in a spec
tacular way with their swords.
The young ladies of the drill corps, hav
ing appeared before the Queen last night,
found it to their advantage as well as the
pleasure of the spectators to present some
new and very attractive evolutions in the
course of their parade. The twenty young
ladies carried their swords like real soldiers
and proved the capability of their in
structor,'M. ,C. Osborne. They showed
themselves to be very proficient in drill
and have become a feature of the Santa
Cruz Water Carnival. They will be looked
for eagerly by the people in the next
demonstration of a like character. The
Santa Cruz people are proud of them, as
the Watsonville people are proud of the
young gentlemen who form the drill corps
of that city.
After the battalion and its followers had
extended from the lower plaza, a distance
as great as the length of the procession,
they counter-marched, > and ,' when they
arrived at the principal business block the
blue jackets '. performed some very excel
lent maneuvers, which gave the : people a
desire to see the great drill, which was
presented when the battalion reached the
Dolphin athletic grounds. -
Some fifteen acres of flat, smooth soil
provided an excellent drill ground, and
tbe 300 marines distinguished themselves
by repeating those perfectly timed military
movements which thousands of people
witnessed last Sunday in Golden Gate Park
in San Francisco.
Before the drill was begun the blue
jackets were given the order to stack arms
and permitted to joy themselves for a
half hour, rolling on the grass and forget
ting for the time the ' labor tney would

army of people who were crowded close
up to the picket line and occupied com
fortable places on. the rolling sides of the
approaches to Beach Hill. , :|?<t^
At the sound of the bugle the 300 sailors
in white were on their feet and ready for
the hour of exercise.
They crossed the broad plain in platoons
of thirty-two, with ~ their mascot dog Gore
romping and playing about the field, now
a leader and again a follower of the bat
talion. Gore got a great deal of joy out of
the afternoon's performance, and the vast
audience applauded his efforts ato dis
tinguish himself as heartily as those of the
men. y-.. â¢ -j
The varied formations, battalion line,
platoons, company â  squares, marching at
double quick, protecting the flanks of the
moving line in the riot drill and many
other very pretty evolutions were executed
promptly while r the band played stirring
music. V After | a ' short rest the I physical
drill of yesterday was repeated, with the
advantage over yesterday's work of hav
ing room for the full battalion. j ifiY-Of
y This drill, being \ the , conclusion â  of the
daylight exercises, was conceded to be the
great feature of the second day of the
Santa Crnz carnival, and when it was done
the spectators seemed to leave reluctantly,
some , going to prepare for the night's dis
play and others lounging on the sands of
the beach. Red and white , striped I tents,
square in form and containing smooth log
settees,: shielded hundreds from the sun,
while other hundreds preferred to 1011, in
the sand and feast their eyes on the battle
ships or to take auip in the surf. 9
On the streets great throngs of happy
people moved about as the sun set glori
ously on the second day's pleasure.
The people seemed never to tire of the
doings of the day, and long before dark
ness ' settled * down sufficiently to perm it
the electrical . display the arena was well
filled. They, were ready to enjoy another
night in this miniature Venice, whose
street of clear and cool water refreshed
those : who thought the sun of midday too
warm for comfort.
jy The electrical display to-night was per
haps-* more effective than last night.
Having got the myriads of floats fixed in:
their' 'minds the spectators enjoyed the
pleasure of : admiring them individually.
The great stretch of water, which was
named y Lagunita â de Carnival, - swarm ed
with boats and floats and barges, ''all gayly
decorated, festooned with flowers and oc
cupied ; by pretty girls, accompanied yby
gallant gentlemen, whose pleasure was the
pleasure of the spectators. ..
The wonderful; harmony . of movement ;
on the water, the brilliancy of y the electric'
lights and y the magnificent colorings and
Mendings of. color," the grand music that
Professor Roncovieri's orchestra rendered,
all combined to make a happy prelude ]to
the grand ball. . ( '
V The Watsonville corps of , forty perfectly

military presentation that has ever been
seen in California. Colonel Koster said
modestly that he had a great drill corps,
and he spoke truly, for the marching and
maneuvering before Queen Josephine
and her royal retinue and faithful sub
jects was wonderful.
The pyrotechnic display outdid that of
the first night. The absence of booming
cannon for there â¢ was no battle fought
to-night gave full effect to the rockets
and Roman candles and the hundreds of
small fireworks that were a delight to the
adults as well as the children. Indeed, the

there was no time between the; rising and

of the carnival when there was discomfort
out or indoors. The various features of

The Mile-a=Minute Mark Annihilated in the
Successful Race to Give Subscribers

News.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., June Anotner
coast record was .broken yesterday morn
ing. It was a case of The Call keeping
up the good work commenced last Tues
day morning, when a special train was
sent to Sacramento to carry the first edi
tion of the great daily to the statesmen
assembled in |the capital. Yesterday it
was decided, in addition to sending the
regular convention special to Sacra
mento, to dispatch a train to carry
copies of The Call to the merry-makers at
the carnival; and accomplished the run in
the unusual time of 2 hours and 58 min
utes, including two stops of fifteen min
utes each to repair damage to journals
caused by the high speed, and several brief
stops to drop off papers.
y Deducting the time of stops from the
total time, it shows that- 121 miles were
covered in 128 minutes, which is surely the
fastest railroad trip ever * accomplished ;.n
California. 7 Even the full time of 2 hours
and jJS minutes beats all previous records
to Santa Cruz by over half an honr. ,'â¢â¢.;
'â !â¢: Quickly the bundles weie torn open, and
with a "Hurrah for The Call!" the boys
screamed over the city leaving the great
newspaper at the homes ; of thousands of
subscribers nearly seven hours before the
other San Francisco morning papers ar
rived. - â¢ y
All things considered, riding on a special
train is hardly a pleasant experience in
spite of the fact that all the equipments
are first-class. , So much coal has to be
burned under a forced draught that many
pounds of cinders find their way into the
cars, covering everything with a thick
coating of dust. Every time the car goes
around even a slight curve, it swings so as
to throw one off his feet.
The Call's special Santa Cruz train was
in charge of Conductor Spears. George
Boyne, The Call's chief mail clem, had
charge of the distribution of papers, as
sisted by Herbert L. Schmitz. At most of
the small stations along the road papers
were thrown off to subscribers, and a
most careful watch had to be kept to
throw the paper before the station disap
peared in the distance. As a consequence,
the work was fatiguing, and when the end
of the journey was reached everybody
aboard was worn out. Car 1402 looked as
if it had just finished a journey across the
continent so thickly were its sides plas
tered with dirt, but The Call's many sub
scribers in Santa Cruz had received their
papers early in the morning, as was the in
tention tbey should; so the trip has gener
ally been conceded to be a successful one,
and most of the citizens of the carnival
city are loud in their praise of the enter
prise of California's great newspaper. .
One of the first men in Santa Crnz to
get a Call was Irving M. Scott, who was
joying a breath of the morning air on
the piazza of the Sea Beach Hotel. "That's
business,'' he said, "and I tell you all of
us here appreciate it highly. Hundreds
of the visitors now here are subscribers of
The Call, and when we see trie great old
newspaper looking after our wants the
same as if we were at home, it makes us
feel that we are not ! forgotten. And, as I
said before, we appreciate it."
, When it . was decided .to send a
special train to Santa Crnz, the
Southern Pacific Railroad people agreed
to have. a train at Fourth and Townsend
streets at 3 o'clock Thursday morning, and
it was there. The work of preparing for
this edition was most difficult coming as
it* did on the same night as the special
train V to Sacramento. Everything -. went
well, however, and before 3 o'clock one of
The; Call's big mail wagons was flying
over the echoing, deserted streets to the
train lying in readiness. By half-past 3
the papers were all aboard of car 1402 and
.Engineer Bradley pulled the throttle on
the old engine, No. 1413, and the journey
commenced.
y High speed was not attempted until the
streets of the city were 'passed, although
the engine and coach flew along at a gait
not usual. When the level track beyond
Ocean View was reached the throttle came
away out, and the train flew t.. rough the
night like a fiend of darkness. Coal was
shoveled in until' flames poured from the
funnel and the single car was wrapped in
a blanket of soot and steam. The clicking
of the wheels . over the rail joints became
faster and faster until it resolved itself into
a steady hum like a buzzsaw. . . South San
Francisco flew by as a flash of lightning,
and in a few - moments the pretty station
at Burlingame was visible for a space of
15no_textno_text16
time only to be measured by the twinkling
of an eye. A heavy bundle of Calls was
thrown off here, but was caught in tbe
vacuum behind the car and carried along
like a feather.
The first stop was made at San Mateo,
which was reached in twenty-five minutes,
and the crowd of waiting carriers grabbed
for their papers. On again sped the spe
cial over the fine stretch of track to San
Jose. Faster and faster through the break
ing dawn that made the mileposts visible!
One mile a minute! Surely that was the
limit for old 1413. No, the next 58 seconds;
now 57, 56, 52, until the last twelve miles
to Santa Clara were covered in 9% min
utes!
More papers were given to waiting car
riers and San Jose was reached in 57 min
utes. Twenty-five carriers eagerly seized
Calls and before 5 o'clock they were dis
tributed to homes all over the Garden
City.
The next twenty miles were covered in
as many minutes, but it was too much for
old 1413. The awful speed had caused one
of the crank-journals to become heated so
that the babbit metal was melted and
scattered in drops over the side of the
boiler. A fifteen-minute stop was neces
sary for cooling and repairing, and then
on to Gilroy. The old journal was weak
ened, though, and another long stop was
nceessary. On the branch road from
Pajaro over to Santa Cruz the old loco
motive seemed to pick up and tore the car
around the curves at such a speed as to
cause it to swing wildly from side to side.
The last mile before Capitola was covered
in 59 seconds, and six minutes later the
train came to a stop at the Santa Cruz sta
tion at exactly 6:28. All of the carriers
Pad been informed of the arrival of - The
Call's special and were on hand waiting
for papers. V -_ y '
SANTA ROSA DIVERSION.
Ex-Congressman Geary Has a
Lively Set-to With Editor
Thompson. '...'.
Considerable Chewing, Scratching* and
Gouging Before the Combatants
- Are Separated.
SANTA ROSA, Cal.. June 18. â Two
Democratic politicians met this afternoon
in an Exchange-avenue resort, and, after a
fierce battle of words, indulged- in about
ten minutes of rough-and-tumble that de
lighted the spectators of the impromptu
mill, and left both principals covered with
gore and glory.
The aegressor in the physical hostilities
was the Hon. R. A. Thompson, editor
of the Democrat, and ex-Congres-man
Thomas J. Geary was the gentleman
forced to back up some very burning per
sonalities by a fistic argument.
The ex-Congressman, after being de
feated for delegate at large, seems to have
lost all interest in the Sacramento conven
tion, and in company with W. H. Grissim
returned this morning to this city. The
author of the Chinese exclusion bill was
not in a very pleasant frame of mind, and
was engaged in telling a party of congenial
spirits "how the play came," when Editor
Thompson dropped in.
Mr. Thompson, by the way, had just re
turned from a visit to the bay, where, it is
reported, he kept the wires hot addressing
a gentleman in Sacramento named Mc-
Nab, and this action had not helped Mr.
Geary in his aspira*ions for a seat in the
Chicago Convention. . -* y , . .
The conversation at once became lurid,
and the inside political history of Sonoma
County for the past twenty years was resur
rected and used with telling effect. Tim
being exhausted, personal pleasantries
were indulged in. The editor, who is on
the shady side of 60 and of a very peace
able disposition, was no match for the ex-
Congressman in vituperation and made
three or four attempts to leave the room,
being recalled each time by some unusu
ally severe verbal castigation. ' â 
' At last forbearance ceased to be a virtue,
and with a yell of rage he seized his burly
tormentor by the throat and. attempted to
force the surprised and dismayed Geary
through a large glass door. There was a
quick rally and the editorial - thumb be
came wedged between the â  attorney's
strong white teeth. This unexpected
event caused a change in the original plan
of attack and a retreat was in order.
After the next rush a kinetoscope would
have been * required to catch the move
ments of the fighters. There was a deal of
pulling and hauling, lots of scratching and
gouging, and the attorney's blood covered
both combatants. It soon became evident
that high living in Washington was not
the proper training for a physical contest,
and that the editor, despite his age, would
prove the better man, more especially
since Geary bad lost his glasses and was
fighting wild. The lawyer's friends seemed
to taKe tins view of the case and the pant
ing gladiators were separated, each claim
ing a victory.
PETALUMA CAPTURE.

; PETALUMA, Cal., June 18.â A capture
was made here last night by Constable
George M. Bush of a man giving his name
as Harry Edwards, though it has been
learned beyond a doubt that his real name
is Ammerman. The officers say that he is
the highwayman who nearly beat Richard
Johnson to death in Santa Rosa Monday
night, besides robbing him of considerable
money, and the evidence against him is
strong. Constable Peerman drove down
from Santa Rosa and returned with the
prisoner. For several days Ammerman
bad been begging and doing odd jobs
about town, but dropped out of sight for a
few days and then returned after the as
sault in Santa Rosa with a pocketful of
money. Two men here are supposed to
be his - confederates and the police * are
keeping them under surveillance.

FOR SILVER.

Horse, Was Named for
Elector at Large.
JETER FOR LIEUTENANT-
GOVERNOR.
Chairman Gould Talks Diplomatically.
Members of the New State Cen
tral Committee.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June When
the Democratic State Convention was
called to order shortly after 9 o'clock this
morning, a general desire was evident to
hurry through with business. Less than
half the delegates were present.
Nominations were declared in order for
alternates to the delegates jat large, and
William B. Wiltshire of Los Angeles, A.
M. McCoy of Tehama, A. Caniinetti of
Amador and A. W. Barrett of Los Angeles
were chosen as such.
For electors at large, William Craig of
San Francisco and W. H. Workman of
Los Angeles were placed in nomination.
Just before the vote was taken Workman
withdrew, Craig was elected by acclam
ation, and then General Jo Hamilton of
Placer was placed before the convention.
After one or two speeches had been made
seconding his nomination, the old politi
cal warhorse ascended 'the platform, and
in a voice unshaken by bis many years, he
made a touching and almost pathetic ap
peal to be excused from the duties of the
honor which his friends were seeking to
force upon him. In the course of his re
marks, he said:
"This is the first time I have ever turned
my back upon the oarty. I served it all
my life, and if I were really able to lead
its columns once more there is no duty X
would rather discharge than the attempt
to lead that party, which has been so kind
to-day, to victory in November next.' '
Hamilton's declination aroused his
friends to the highest degree of enthusi
asm, and several of them made eloquent
pleas asking him to reconsider his de
termination. When these had finished
Chairman Gould stated that he thought
tbe old general had changed his mind, and
was willing to accept. The general, who
bad remained on tbe platform during all
this time, now came forward and spoke a
few words, as follows: ,
â¢'The determination that I came to to de
cline is one that was fixed in my mind
when I came ; here. . I deeply thank you
for the mark of affection you have shown
me. I feel that in placing my name at the
head of your electoral ticket and insisting
upon its remaining there, that you have
done me an honor which I cannot in jus
tice to you and the duty which I feel I
owe the party, decline. Ido not feel my
self able to stand against the express wish
of those I love so well and to whom I am
under such great obligations."
General Hamilton's selection was made
by acclamation.
White ol Santa Cruz offered a resolution
providing that the nomination for Lieu
tenant-Governor be passed and left in the
hands of the State Central Committee.
After it had been adopted it was feared
that this action was in conflict with the
election laws and after some debate the
resolution was rescinded.
Marion Brooks of Los Angeles placed
W. T. Jeter, the incumbent, in . nomina
tion for the position of Lieutenant-Gov
ernor, and he was unanimously indorsed.
An invitation was 'accepted from the
Carnival Association of Santa Cruz to at
tend the Venetian Festival now in progress
in that city. .
Resolutions of thanks on behalf of the
convention to the chairman and other
officers of that body and to the -people of
Sacramento, and on behalf of the visiting
newspaper men to E. B. Willis and the
other members of the local press commit
tee for courtesies extended were adopted. s3
â¢ By resolution the State Central Commit
tee was empowered to fill all vacancies
that might occur on tbe ticket named by
the convention.
Kinney of , Los Angeles offered a resolu
tion providing that the Democratic State
conventions be held alternately north and
south of Tehachani, at a time andoplace
to be selected by the State Central Com
mittee. This was declared out of order by
the chairman, after considerable debate
had taken place. - \
... Marion , Brooks . of Los Angeles intro
duced a . resolution providing "â' that . the
entire California delegation be instructed
to vote as a unit. He declared that 'the
adoption of Reed's resolution indorsing
the National administration virtually re
leased the delegates from their pledge to
support the silver plank the -platform,
and added that while the delegate at large
would undoubtedly vote according to the
wishes of the convention in reference to
silver, he was a little afraid that a gold bug
might have slipped into one of the district
delegations to Chicago.
. Considerable debate followed, and finally
Burke of Santa Cruz' offered an amend
ment providing that all delegates should
vote as a unit at Chicago for a . candidate
and for principles in the platform that
would favor -the free coinage of silver in
the ratio of 16 to 1. This was adopted,
and after the various counties had handed
in their selections of members to comprise
tbe State Central Committee, the conven
tion at 11 :20 o'clock adjourned sine die.

Mr. Gould said he would not appoint

"I will have to consult with a number
of people," he said ; ; "you see, there are so
many interests that have to be looked after

ROMANTIC STORY
FROM PORTLAND.
Mrs. Skelton of Washing-
ton Secretly Marries
George Bunn.
LOVERS TEN LONG YEARS
Three Weeks Ago the Bride
Deserted Her Former
Husband,
WHO DIED OF A BROKEN HEART
The Bunns Will Spend Their Honey.
moon in the Quiet Little Town
of Kelso.
PORTLAND, Ob., June 18.â A strange
story has leaked out in connection with a
secret marriage ceremony which was per
formed last night by a local Justice of the
Peace, the contracting parties being Mrs.
Adelaide J. Skelton of Washington, D. C,
and George Bunn. The marriage license
was issued on Monday after office hours,
and extra precautions were taken to coyer
up the matter. , The marriage is the con
summation of "a: romance of at least ten
years' standing, and also an elopement
from the National capital, which, when it
becomes known, will certainly cause con
sternation in society circles there.
Mrs. Skelton and Mr. Bunn came to this
city from Kelso, Wash., a secluded village
on the other side of the Columbia River.
They have been several weeks in Kelso
living as man and wife, and have returned
there, it is presumed, to live quietly until
the affair blows off. y -\ -
The elopement took place from Wash-
ington some three weeks ago., Mrs. Skel
:on was a wife when she started from
Washington to join her lover at Chicago.
She is now a widow, and the bonds which
held her to another are severed by death
instead of a divorce court. Upon receiv-
ing news of. the death of her husband a
few days ago the woman at once came
here with Bunn and they were secretly
married. The only witness of the cere-
mony was Colonel William H. Eppinger,
one of the foremost lawyers of the city
and an ex-member of the bench. JiiHge
Eppinger, who was a friend of Bunn, was
pledged to secrecy.
It appears that Mrs. Skelton bad de-
cided some time ago to leave her husband,
for whom she had never had any affection.
The Skeltons are said to be well up in
social circles, and both Mrs. Skelton and
Bunn possess evidence of wealth. Before
her marriage Mrs. Skelton was promised
to young Bunn, who went to the Orient
and was not heard from for years. Upon
his reappearance in Washington last win
ter, where bis old love was living, the long
separated couple met.
Skelton, it is understood, was formerly
attached to the foreign legation, ana bis
wile was quite a belle in social circles at
Washington. Affairs reached such a point
with the lovers that an elopement was de
cided upon, and their course was west
ward. They could not have /selected; a
more out of the way corner of the country
than Kelso.
The shock was too great for Skelton to
survive, and when his wife failed to an
swer his entreaties to come back to him
he suddenly became ill'and died. .
The appearance of the strangers in the
quiet village of Kelso stirred up quite a
breeze, and as the natives were so curious
to know what they had come there to live
for, they were told '.Mrs. Bunn was going
to try the country air. The; couple are
greatly admired by the people of Kelso,
and their strange past is unknown to their
neighbors. â¢"â  '.. - ' , 'â â¢- ' '.
MILITARY DAY
AT SANTA CRUZ.
Continued from Fifteenth Page-
well comprehended by the performers, and
the phrasing and shading were remark
ably good, considering that the music was
played out of doors. The scheme of pic
turing on a screen scenes from the coun
try where William Tell made his home
proved a. great success.' Each change of
picture, with the change in the music,
brought forth rounds of applause.
â¢ Gounod's "Queen of Sheba" made a hit
in both a musical and a pictorial way.
The pictures . consisted of eight repro
ductions of paintings from the Paris Salon.
-* The "Medley of familiar hymns," with
a picture lor each, kept the audience in an
uproar. - "Old Hundred" and "Rock of
Ages" were more than could be listened to
in silence. * â¢'T ;
'--. Donyan's illustrated piece, entitled "A
Day at the Races." was received doubt
fully. To be sure there are many good
things in the music and also in the pic-
tures, but ; they don't " harmonize. ; The
picture of a "False Start" was really good,
but the musical accompaniment is built
somewhat on the plan of a Chinese funeral
march.
"Remembrances of the Midway," by the
same author, was a little better and the
pictures gems in their way. ' y '
' "The Flower Festival March,'' by Ronco
vieri, is a pretty little thing, and there
were many good points V about it,' the har
mony being particularly pleasing. It was
a' fitting ending to Y the *. programme,' and
sent the large audience away well pleased,
some to their homes/ but many to the ball.
There was never a prettier interior dec
oration in' California than that of the hall
in which Queen" Josephine gave the tall to
her loyal subjects of Santa Cruz to-night.
The building itself is nothing more than a
cheap wooden box with V peaked roof, but
ingenuity and taste turned it into a bower
of beauty.- ' v* ' ..**
â  v.The ; decorating materials are of the
simplest ? kind, netting, ; bunting and
flowers being used. The netting is fastened
to ; the . peak ? of -! the" roof and then draped
away to ''the pillars on either side /of the
large hall, but allowed to droop gracefully.
Intertwined with* this are bands of yellow
and white bunting,' and "over the whole,
bright colored roses are fastened. /The
pillars on both sides are twined bun
ting and ornamsnted with bright colored
ribbon. The wall space behind the pillars
iis covered with I dark" evergreen, '. wi-ich
throws everything else- into strong but
pleasant contrast. Behind the netting are
hundreds ". of incandescent lights which
filter their brilliant rays through the* thin
fabrics.
These fall on the white canvas floor with
a soft, uncertain glimmer suggestive of
fairyland. * ; . . .'il|BfBÃS_B
The general effect of the hall, seen from
the western "end, is brilliant and ': at the
same time delicate and dreamy. The soft
folds of the different fabrics, sway gently
and produce a shimmer, of harmonious
colors. â  -
It was into this . bower of , beauty that
Queen Josephine invited her loyal sub
jects. They came, young and old, and all
happy and perfectly willing to pass away
the hours with flying fleet. y
The time set for the opening of the ball
was 10 o'clock, but long before that hour
carriages began-to roll up to the doorway,
and handsome women, gowned in silks or
satins, stepped daintily out and " tripped
merrily into the realms of pleasure.
*It was some time after 10 o'clock before
Queen Josephine and her suite arrived.
Little Rosalie Bernheim, attired in a chic
suit of bright satin, acted as trumpeter
and led the way between the assembled
guests to the throne at the end of the hall.
The queen wore a gown made specially
for the occasion, and over it the royal
mantle of plush and ermine, the train car
ried by her pages. Her prime minister,
Benjamin K. Knight, acted as her escort.
The Â« maids %of i honor in i light â â â¢ gowns of
pleasing hues ; followed . her majesty. As
the procession passed j down the long hall
It made a picture full of life and color. All
was beauty, pleasure and happiness.
When the royal , parade reached the
throne, the queen took her seat and her
maids of honor occupied places on ' both
sides of her. This group completed the
pleasing effect of the ball-room, as the
gowns blended with the yellow and white
carnival colors. After retaining her seat
on the throne until the ball was well
started, the queen joined the merrymakers.
Dancing was Kept up until after 2 o'clock,
and when the last number bad been
tripped, all who shared â  the pleasures of
the evening sighed to think that the sec
ond day of the carnival was really over.
In a short time the vast hall was in dark
ness and the dancers resting, so as to be in
readiness for the pleasures to follow with
the rising of the sun. 'â¢ .y .â '

SANTA BARBARA PETITIONER.
Willing to Take Charge of Judge Huso's
Person' and Estate.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., June 18.â I.
F. Fisher of this place has petitioned to be
appointed guardian of the person and
estate of Charles E. Huse, now confined in
the San Bernardino Insane Asylum. It
will be ' remembered that Judge Otis, in
pronouncing : upon Attorney Gallardo's
appeal for his old friend's release, stated
that he would be only too r glad to grant
the application if Mr. Huse only had some
competent and responsible friend to step
forward as a suitable and responsible
guardian, as while he was . satisfied .that
the-patient's mind was remarkably clear,
"and that he was capable and able in
almost all respects, he yet had manifested
certain peculiarities which: demonstrated
the need of a;- friendly oversight. Taken
in connection with this statement, Mr.
Fisher's application must be regarded as
significant.

REDDING PIONEER DEAD.
Abraham Cunningham, a Notable
Character of the West,
Is No More. /
His Heroic Adventures as an Indian-
Fighter Would Form an Inter-
esting Volume.
REDDING, Cal., June 18.â One of
Northern California's oldest pioneers and
Indian-fighters has just passed to that
bourne from which no traveler returns.
Abraham Cunningham, who in early days
gained considerable notoriety as an Indian
fighter, died at his home near Shingle
town. Cunningham crossed the plains in
1849, and was one of the first party of white
men to settle on the west fork of Cotton
wood Creek, this county. He was the dis
coverer of Watson Gulch and Arbnckle
mining camps, and in his labors then had
many exciting encounters with Indians.
He saved Ben Wright's life once by his
bravery, and ; while a savage redman was
in the act of sending an arrow through
Wright's heart Cunningham ; bravely ran
to his comrade's rescue and sent a bullet
through the heart of the Indian. He was
a veritable Daniel Boone in the woods, and
many a mining camp was saved ' irom de
struction and the occupants saved from
massacre by Cunningham's steady aim
and bravery. The history of his exploits
in Northern California would form an in
teresting volume, but, like the majority of
old-time miners, he did not seek notoriety
and his ' adventures have never been pub
lished. :'.; -, ' ' ' â  '^y-v

Heart failure.
VALLEJO, Cal., June 18.â Father

; The funeral will take place from St. Vin
cent's Church at 9:30 Friday morning.
The remains will then be taken over to the

RAYMOND, Cal., June 18. -This morn
ing, about 9 o'clock, .the Yosem.ite stage,
running between Raymond and Wawona,
was held up and robbed by a lone high
wayman about six miles from town. The
stage was running on its regular trip and
was driven by John S. Stevens, who until
lately has been one of the deputy sheriffs
The Yosemite Stage That Was Held Up Yesterday Near Raymond on the Road to the Yosemite.
[From a photograph.]
of Fresno County and was instrumental in
the capture of the outlaws Sontag and
Evans. In relatine the story, he said:
â¢â â¢; "I had just made a turn when I saw an
object in the road. I did not know what
it was at first. It was dressed in gunny
sacks from top to bottom. When I had
approached to within twenty feet it proved
to be a masked man. who suddenly swung
a gun around and pointing it at me told
me .to halt. When I did so he requested
me to throw out the Wells-Fargo box and
I promptly obeyed.
"He then commanded the passengers to
throw out their money. All of the pas
sengers complied with the exception of
Captain Bailey, who said he had brought
no money with him. . The jobber then
told me to drive on, and he kept his gun
pointed at the stage until a turn in the
road left him alone with his spoils." -.
There were two express boxes, on the
stage/a way box and a through box, and
the box that was thrown out was the way
box, which contained two waybills and a
worthless letter. The value of the prop
erty taken from the passengers is said to
aggregate about $15. The stage proceeded
on till the Nine-mile House . was reached,
when a boy was dispatched back to Ray
mond with the news of the robbery, and a
telegram brought Sheriff Westfall and one
of his deputies from Madera. .
Sheriff Prouty oT^fSViposa County had
also received word of the robbery, and he
joined Westfall in the chase. A small
posse was organized, and the express-box
was found about half a mile ; distant from
-where the robbery' was committed. It had
been broken into, the lock on the outside
being broken off, and with the exception
of the loss of the padlock was uninjured. '"
There were the tracks of one man lead
ing to where the box was found, and the
tracks of two horses leading away from it
in a northerly direction, which . leads the
officers to believe that the robber had a
confederate, who aided in his escape.
The officers will continue the search, but
on account of the roughness of the : sur
rounding country it will be a difficult task
to capture the robber. -
There have been three men arrested on
suspicion. One of them is an unknown
man here who has been loitering around
town for a few days. He was seen shortly
after the robbery coming from that direc
tion and was arrested by Constable Leon
ard. I '
The other two men are William Little
field and David Robinson, who are both
known to some extent throughout 'the
country. â¢ â 
ThÂ«= indications of guilt, if any, that
pointed toward these men are somewhat
vague and indefinite, other than that it
was thought somebody ought to be ar
rested.

MINERS DEMAND THEIR PAY.
Serious Trouble Narrowly Averted at the
Golden Cross Mine.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., June 18.â Serious
trouhle among the 170 miners at the
Golden Cross mine on the desert was nar
rowly averted a day or two ago. The com
pany owning the , great, properties is em
barrassed through mismanagement, and
W. W. Stewart of this city has just taken
charge as receiver under a $25,000 bond,
his salary being $8000 per year.
â  T. S. Fuller, former manager of the
mine, arrived to-day with the owners,
Hedges Brothers, to justify Receiver Stew
art's bonds.
Before the receiver arrived at the camp,
according to Mr. Fuller, the 170 men em
ployed in the mines, who had not been
paid regularly, were in open revolt against
C. H. Toll, manager for the trustees, and
only the words of cool-headed men among
them prevented trouble. These men in
duced the miners to hold a meeting in
Miners' Union hall and talk over their
troubles dispassionately. After assem
bling, they sent for Mr. Fuller, who cau
tioned them against violence.
About the time of Mr. Stewart's ap
pointment as receiver an order was re
ceived from the trustees at Los Angeles to
make a clean-up of amalgam. As th- reg
ular time for making a clean-up had not
arrived the miners became suspicious and
feared that their pay was to be with
held. The amalgam was not allowed
to be sent to Los Angeles,
but was locked' up in the com
pany's safe and the building put in charge
of two employes, who were furnished with
revolvers and given orders to allow no-
body to remove anything from the office.
The threatened trouble was finally avoid
ed by change of management.7
According to Mr. Fuller Receiver Stew
art will have no trouble in managing the
property, and the $150,000 necessary to pay
off the debts of the company can be taken
from the mines within six months. At
the 300-foot level there is said to ibe
$100,000 worth of ore in sight.
SAN LUIS LAND SHARKS.
They Sold Worthless . Property to Over
Five Hundred People.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Cal., June 18â The
County Bank of this city has commenced
action in the Superior Court against L.C
Branch, proprietor of the notorious Morro
Bay Improvement Company, to foreclose
a mortgage on some property on the Cor
ral de Piedra rancho and on 1000 acres of
town lots in El Morro. â¢
It is a matter of general sincere regret
that the suit was not -; brought years ago.
It puts a quietus on tbe notorious "Morro
Bay Improvement Company," a scheme
which has bunkoed 500 individuals out of
a hundred dollars or more each. The
dupes received a supposed title to an in
finitesimal piece of -worthless sand dune,
inaccessibly s ituated.
The proposition, as originally laid before
the public and which received the approval
of those cognizant of the proceedings, ywas
to undertaKe the improvement of Morro
Bay and provide such buildings, hotels,
roads and alamedas as should mane an
attractive and popular seaside resort. The
capital required was to be procured from
the sale of lots. It does not appear that
the parties who devised and arranged: the
scheme had any intention of making any
such use of the moneys received. Oh the
contrary, their efforts were confined to
making a map, priming deeds and pocket
ing the proceeds of the sales made.
: The victims were given ;to understand
that the "lots" were sold free and clear of
all incumbrance, but as shown by j the
present suit the schemers did not have the
decency to take the small percentage of
the winnings required to clear * off ;, the
mortgage and apply -it- to that purpose.
Consequently in tbe present action all the
unfortunate lot-holders are made defend
ants and the suit will kill off any hopes
they may have been foolish enough to enter
tain with reference to. their vanished coin.
.: This land scheme has been very detri
mental to the whole county, and every one
is rejoicing that the land -sharks have at
last been; brought :up with a sharp turn.
Many purchasers of lots reside in San
Francisco. * ****.*-â -''' â " '.'.?'.'?*'

STABBED TO DEATH
AT LOS ANGELES.
J. F. Wallace Killed in a
Quarrel by Horace
Dibble.
AN EYE-WITNESS' STORY
The Men Worked Together and
Engaged in a Hot War
of Words.
SHORTLY FOLLOWED BY BLOWS
Then Wallace Staggered Back, Ex-
claiming, "Dibble Has Cut Me
All to Pieces."
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 18.â The
numerous friends and ' acquaintances -â  of
Horace B. Dibble of this city are in great
distress over an unfortunate affray be-
tween himself and J. J F. | Wallace, which
i has cost the latter his life under circum
| stances which make it very difficult for
the survivor to extricate himself on the
grounds of self-defense. - Dibble is city
salesman for â¢ the : Pacific Coast Crockery
Company, doing business at 226 North Los
Angeles street The deceased was a store
employe of the same concern. V';
The tragic encounter occurred at the
store early this morning, and reports dif
fer as to the circumstances which led up
to the fatal stabbing. Alfred Pearson and
T. W. Heard were the [ only parties y who
witnessed the killing. Mr. Heard . states
that he was working in the shipping de
partment when be heard the pair engaged
in an excited conversation. Their words
were hot and their actions threatening and
emphatic. He was standing about forty
feet > from them. â¢ His attention was at
tracted by . quarrelsome words, and he
stepped out of the door, of the packing
room - and saw Wallace advancing ,on
Dibble.
At that time they were about fifteen feet
apart. He â  saw Wallace strike at Dibble
and push him away, and heard him say,
"If you allude 'to that hammer again 1
will strike you."
; Heard . turned to the shipping-room,
when *he heard words ) of a very profane
nature used by Dibble to Wallace. He im-
mediately turned and saw Wallace and
Dioble close < together. He saw Wallace
striking Dibble, who, with his left hand
raised, was attempting to shield the blows.
Then the men broke away, Wallace
staggering to one side, and Heard caught
him in his arms . and ' assisted him â ' to a
pallet of straw, on ; which he was laid.
The wounded man said, "Dibble - has cut
me all to pieces." ">
Wallace was taken to the receiving hos
pital, where he died a few moments after
ward. The last words he uttered were
those above quoted.
The deceased had been in this city about
a year. He leaves a wife and child at 4240
Champagne avenue, Chicago. His wife
was informed of her husband's death and
she is now on the way to this city. De-
ceased was about 30 years of age.
y Horace B. Dibble, the man now under
arrest, has resided in Los .Angeles â  nearly
twenty years, He Is about 40 years of age,
has a wife aiid resides at ; 110 ; Downey ave
i nue. He is a; member of the Foresters,
A. O. U. W. and Odd Fellows. He is well
known > and universally liked. He has
been employed yby { the firm 'â  for several
years. â.
; A Call correspondent saw Dibble at the
jail and asked him if he wished to' make a
statement. He replied that he did 'not,
except that he had been cowed by T de
ceased, threa tened and bullyragged' until
he was forced to defend himself.

in signing the contract between the Pacific

SAN JOSE, Cal.,' June 18.â past
year has been a disastrous one to all busi

â¢feeling the effect more acutely than prob
ably any other branch. . In they general
improvement which is now showing in all
lines of business property interests are, as
is always the case, among the first to re
ceive substantial benefits. ; Quiet but '. very
effective work has % been going on in this
county, which "' wil! be of far -'reaching.
benefit not only to Santa Clara but to the
entire State. v
About four years ago the Morgan Hill
ranch, a'â  beautiful : domain of 10,000 acres,
without improvements; ; was" subdivided
and offered 'for* homes. Notwithstanding
the great depression "that has character
ized business since then, there has grown
up on that * property a resident population
of 500 people, who yean boast of â¢ a large
$5000 schoolbouse ] arid ; one '/ of "â â the finest
railroad stations on the line. Waterworks
have been established and y 3000 acres of
fine orchards are now growing on the
ranch, and young as the trees many of
them are bearing crops. *
The San Martin, another large ' property
i near i the ? Morgan ; Hill y- has been â¢'â  on 5 the
market for three years, with v similarly
gratifying J results. Here < are 1 19,000 ; acres
of the choicest of Santa Clara lands. y
The :' prices - that i were ; first â¢ put Â£on . the
NEW -A TO-DAT-Crj_OT__G.
land of : the Morgan Hill and San Martin
ranches 'have y been; steadily maintained,
and to-day the land is selling at increased
figures.
C. H. Phillips, who with T. G. Mont
gomery has been J; directing ;I the y sale of
these lands, made in March last the largest
single sale of : real estate ever made in this
State. â â â  This property was i* the .'; Chino

; SAN JOSE, Cal., June 18.â Some sensa

said' that Mrs." Parker told her when she
came from New York once in about 1872
that she had ' been living with two * other
women; all" of whom had \ been "i supported
by men. : She was well dressed - andy had
diamonds and; jewelry. On one occasion
she said she had bean ; livivg with a man
named -'George' L..' Brown, and they had

going to leave 5 him because .* she : had * ob
tained all she could from him. .
Mrs. Beatley detailed the flirtation that
led to Emma Parker and herself meeting
Ed Parker and a Mr. Scranton. Ed Parker
and' Mr. Scranton were on the street, when
Mrs. Parker struck up a flirtation. r Mr.
Scranton made the advances,' and because
the witness was bashful Emma referred to
her as a' simple country girl. The arrange- â 
ments for a drive were made in a hotel
parlor while Ed Parker was ? waiting out
side Â£ for '. the - developments. When V ar
ranged, Parker and ;the j contestant drove
together and the witness and Mr. Scranton. j
They went to Rocky Hill, where a game
supper with plenty of wine was { joyed.
They spent the entire evening there drink
ing and singing. They all became intoxi
cated.;: On their way back to town an acci
dent happened to Parker's rig, and the two
men took their companions to the Charter
Oak building, where they secured a room. '
The deponent says Emma I; Parker was
under the â¢ influence of liquor when they :
arrived at ** the room.' They had more
liquor to drink, and the entire party spent
the night in the room together.

PLIEO WHIP IN THE WATER
Mrs. A. P. McArthur Punished
a Swimmer Who Gave
Offense.
] The Superintendent of the Baths Ex-
plains That It All Arose From
plains That It All Arose From
a Misunderstanding.
a Misunderstanding.
Swish, swish, swish went a handsome
but a stiff riding whip in the baths at
Bush and Larkin streets last evening about
I -1 o'clock.
It was wielded by fair hands sparkling
with radiant rings, backed by a feminine
face expressing indignation. .
By the side of the lady stood a gentle*
man with his hand on his pistol pocket.
The blows fell on . the shoulders of
s George P. Goetze, a swimmer then in the
baths.
Tbe whip was- vigorously plied by Mrs.
A. P. McArthur, a handsome bride, who
has rooms at the Beresford, at Stockton
and Bush streets, with her husband, a
young man, who felt capable of inflicting
all kinds of punishment on the swimming
instructor. ' v "
The grievance of * Mrs. McArthur 'â . was
that she claims to have been insulted by
Goetze in the baths yesterday afternoon.
Her charge is that be was entirely too fa
miliar with her in words and in his con
duct with her.
When she went home she, of course, told
her husband, and after an early dinner
they procured , a riding whip. and a re-'
volver â  and _ together went to the baths â¢ to
mate out punishment to the unsuspecting
Mr. Goetze. It was at an hour when very
few people were in the baths, but the
scene did not lack in its dramatic features
for want of spectators.
The superintendent of the Oaths last
night explained the episode as a misun
demanding through nnd through. -He
said Mr. Gofltze is a German that Mrs.
McArthur made, a sudden appeal to him
for a safety-pin, and that he '. simply ; re
plied to her that he was not furnishing
safety-pins for ladies. The superintend
ent says he feels certain, from a talk with
Mr. Goetze after the occurrence, that he
meant no offense.
He says there were several other. ladies
in the bath with Mrs. McArthur and that
they took no offense at the remark made
by the swimmer.
ARC AT A'S DAIRY CONVENTION.
Cream of Scientific Discussion Skimmed
From a Milky Evening.
ARCATA, Cal., June 18.â The California
Dairy Association, with the co-operation
of the agricultural department of the State
University, is holding its second . meeting
in Humboldt County.
The meeting is being held at the earnest
request of the citizens of Areata and vicin
ity, who are very much interested in the
subject of advanced dairying. The uni
versity is represented by Professors Wood
worth and Jaffe.
The convention opened with an address
of welcome by Thomas Devlin, to whom
A. P. Martin of Petaluma replied. Music
and recitations by local talent were inter
spersed between the scientific addresses.
The scientific part of the programme
consisted of an address on the com
position of California creamery butter
by Professor Jaffe; Professor Wood
worth's lecture on bacteria and John
McConaghy's remarks on the feeding of
cows. The remarks of each speaker were
followed by a general discussion of the
subject by the audience.
Later in the evening theory and science
were laid aside and the delegates wit
nessed the highly interesting and charm
ing operetta entitled "The Dairy Maids'
Convention." This was artistically and
cleverly presented by sixteeen young
ladies of Areata, who convinced the audi
ence by the ease and grace with which they
executed their respective parts that they
are not at all times engaged In skimming
milk.
SEEN NEAR LOS ANGELES.
A Heavily Armed Stranger Who
May Have Been Mur- ;N
derer Dunham.
An Orange County Widow and a Flor
ence Rancher Tell Plausible
' Stories.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 18.âDe
tectives and peace officers generally who
were inclined to smile broadly at yester
day's report about Dunham, which ema
nated from ex- United States Marshal
Gard, are now beginning to hedge in the
best manner possible.
Judging from what appears to be a re
liable report, Murderer Dunham was seen
yesterday afternoon by Mrs. Jane Moore,
a widow, near the town of Fullerton, on
the Santa Fe Railroad, near the edge of
Orange County. Mrs. Moore described the
suspect as heavily armed. He asked for
something to eat and was waited on by
Mrs. Moore, who took a close survey of her
guest. He was heavily armed and was in
rough Clothes. The supposed murderer
remarked during the meal that he was on
his way to San Diego.
Awhile before Dunham's arrival three
mounted officers who concealed their
identity rode np and inquired of Mrs.
Moore if she had seen' an armed stranger
traveling south.
Sne had not, but thought the inquiry a
strange one, and when the armed stranger
did appear the lady was greatly impressed
with the coincidence, and immediately set
about finding what it all meant. She soon
learned that Dunham was supposed to be
in this part of the State, and from a news
paper picture shown her by a neighbor
declared that her visitor must have been
the original of the cut.
Mrs. Moore knew as little of the officers
as she did of her armed, hungry man, and
it is not yet known who they are, but they
are believed to be officers from Santa Bar
bara or Ventura counties. These things,
coupled with the Gard story of the stranger
seen by the Florence rancher, give color
to the probability of its truth. A report is
current here this evening that Sheriff
Nichols of Orange County is out with a
posse on the trail of the murderer, with
good prospects of bagging his game before
morning.
FARMER LOCK WOOD'S STORY.
Seems Likely That He Wat on the Trail
of Dunham.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., June 18.â Sandy
Lockwood, who owns land and a number
of gold claims on the desert, arrived at
Warner's ranch yesterday with the news
that he had struck the trail of a man
traveling on foot in Santa Rosa Canyon,
twenty-five or thirty miles south of Wal
ters station, on the Southern Pacific on
the ; desert. The trail led due south
toward the Mexican line. From its loca
tion Lock wood believed the trail to be
made by a man either lost, crazy or fleeing
from justice.
Knowing that Dunham, the San Jose
murderer, was well acquainted with this
country, which he visited two years ago,
and believing that he would head for
Lower California if he escaped the poSses
in the neighborhood of his crime, Lock
wood decided to follow the trail. He fol
lowed it all that day and until noon the
next day, but found himself at that time
with only one drink in his canteen and no
feed for his horse. He was compelled to
abandon the trail then, and made for the
"Coyotes" for a supply of water and feed.
Lockwood said the man evidently car
ried something on his back, from the im
pression made by the shoes in the sand.
The tracks were toward the peninsula, but
out of the track usually taken by pros
pectors and others going to Lower Cali
fornia.
On his return to his camp at Borrego
Springs Lockwood found that the man
had been there and taken some food and a
package of smoking tobacco. He identi
fied the tracks as those of the man he bad
been trailing southward. .>"
This action indicated to his mind that
the man was well aware of what be bad
been doing and intentionally kept out of
the way of -people traveling in those parts.
Lockwood says that an Indian at the
springs saw a man several miles from there
whose tracks, when examined, answered
those that Lockwood followed. A detailed
description of the m an will \be obtained
from the Indian. The authorities at
Campo, on the boundary, line, have been
notified by telephone of the actions of the
mysterious : stranger, and . a party will go
out from there to intercept him if possible.

FOG WHISTLES AND LAMPS.
The Vessel Will Be Provided With
Interesting Novelties and B<-
Built Here.
San Francisco is to have a second light
vessel as a beacon to all ships that come in
from the sea through the Golden Gate.
She will ride the waves in storm and calm
The New Type of Lightship Adopted by the United States Light Service, One of
Which Will Be Stationed on the Bar.

alike, securely anchored, just beyond the
bar, and within easy View of the Cliff
House.
In all probability this vessel will be built
in the Potrero or Harbor View yards.
Plans and specifications will come from
Washington, and shipbuilders here will be
given an opportunity to bid upon her con
struction. The cost, as allowed in t*-e
sundry civil appropriation bill, is $30,000.
With that amount at its disposal the
United States * Lighthouse Board will be
able to build a lightship of the latest and
most approved pattern, and equip her fully
throughout for her long vigils off the
Golden Gate.
The United States Lighthouse Board
has adopted a type of light vessel which
compares favorably, if not indeed excels
the types of other nations, and this ship
will be on the same lines with some small
improvements added, She is to be a trim
built, powerful vessel, of quite graceful
outlines, resembling a steam schooner.
Unlike the old lightships, she will be
provided with auxiliary engines and pro
pellers so that she can take care of herself
should her moorings give way in a storm.
Besides, sbe will have a schooner rig with
main and foresails. Her length will be
112' feet, y breadth -28U feet, depth of
hold 13 feet. In construction, she will be
composite, her frame, keelplate, sheers
trake and bilge to be of steel, iike the deck
framing, strinsers and tie plates. The
covering will be wood with a copper
covered bottom to prevent fouling. This
peculiarity of construction* furnishes the
needed strength to withstand the longitu
dinal, transverse anc twisting movements,
all of which must be borne by a ship
moored as she will be in the open sea. By
the introduction of wood, the possibility
of corrosion of steel plates is avoided, as
well as frequent docking, and the con
sequent absence of the ship from her
station. V
The propeller engine will be capable of
driving her at a speed of nine miles an
hour, and in the case of heavy seas or
storms she will be thus enabled to face the
wind and so relieve the strain on her
anchors. â¢ " V
The anchor will weigh 5000 pounds. The
fog signal will be a* 12-inch whistle of the
chime class, giving out distinct and differ
ent notes, produced by either steam or
compressed air.
On her two masts day signals of globular
shape will be hoisted, and at nightclusters
of electric lights strengthened by lens and
powerful reflectors. The hull will be
divided into a great variety, of compart
ments, as . every -. bit of space must be
utilized.
y There will be an after cabin, engine,
boiler, oil and sail rooms, a large fresh
water tank in the . hold, a chain locker,
fore . hold, . storerooms, crew space, â  etc.,
with locKers of many kinds on the top
deck; but there is ito be ho obstruction
above this hurricane deck. .
The lightship will be moored outside
the bar about" seven miles from Point
Bonita and the Cliff House, at the present
location of the whistling buoy. 'Ships
coming into â  the harbor after dark "pick
up" this buoy and then steer straight
ahead for the Fort Point light. This
course is pursued until a point about mid
way between Point Bonita light and Point
Lobes is reached, when a tack is taken
toward the Lime Point light, V which
brings the mariner inside the harbor. The
rest is easy sailing. - - -

CLEVELAND, Ohio, Juno 13.â W. E.
Jackson, who was arrested at the instance
of y Mrs. Agnes McElrath. who claimed
that he had followed her from California,
was arraigned in the Police Court to-day,
and pleaded not guilty.
â¢'I love the woman and she loves me,"
said Jackson. "My father would not con
sent to me paying her attention, arid when
I -persisted he was : angry and f wrote her
several letters asking her to leave Califor

has the letters and will show them to you.
She shows them in every city we have vis
ited. Will she prosecute me? Oh, I sup
pose so. She will get me locked up and
then get me liberated. Why do I follow
her? I will tell you. She makes me. Is
that an Intelligent reply? The woman
revels in variety. She can cry at a mo

quickly. She is smart and can converse
on any. subject. She has a faculty of
arousing sympathy and makes friends on

"That man is a villain," said (Mrs. Mc-
Elrath. "He will yet kill me. He has
said that he would, and I expect that he
will carry out his threat. I cannot rid
myself of him. He has dogged me for
years and I have several times had him

prison where he will remain for a long
time." * â¢ . * â¢ :..-.<â 
Mrs. McElrath is loaded with letters
which she says she has received from Jack

for him, so she alleges, and only wants to
get away from where. he is. She gives no
explanation of why she came to Cleveland,
further than to get rid of Jackson. She
has newspaper clippings giving accounts
of her exploits with the man now arrested,
and said that if anything is written in the
Cleveland papers she would be pleased to
have a marked copy sent to her.

The aisles and galleries of Odd Fellows-
Hall were packed last night by the friends
of the Dental College graduates of the
class of '06. y-
Long before the opening march com
menced the exercises every available seat
and even standing-room Was at a pre
mium.
The hall had been tastefully and appro
priately decorated. Festoons of blue and
gold, the college colors, were gracefully
hung about the sides of the gallery, from
which also great streamers of the same
colors were hung and gathered on a clus
ter above the center of the hall. Blue
streamers, dotted with stars of gold,
dropped gracefully from the center of the
ceiling.
The broad stage was also draped with
blue and gold streamers and groups of
American flags. Suspended on wires
along tbe front of the stage were golden
letters forming the inscription, "Uni
versity of California, College of Den-
tistry." In addition, on the front of the
stage were four pedestals draped with yel
low" bunting, -on which were the
golden letters "U" and "C," with shields
of stars and stripes as background.
As the last strains of the opening march
died away the fifty-two graduates filed in
from the eastern entrance', all ciad in the
flowing classic collegiate gowns and wear
ing tasseled mortar-boards. .t
As they took their seats in the front of
the hall President Kellogg of the univer
sity and Rev. W. W. Bolton, rector of St.
Mary's Episcopal Church, entered the
stage, followed by the members of tbe
Dental College Faculty.
As the members of the graduating class
received their I diplomas irom President
Kellogg they were greeted with generous
applause. The bestowal of degrees upon
the five ladies of tne class, Drs. Ayers,
Band, Gilbert, Mac Donald . and Sawyer,
called forth unusually generous plaudits.
Many beautiful floral offerings also testi
fied to the popularity and esteem in Which
the individual members of the class were
held.
The majority of the class was composed
of young Californians, native sons and
daughters. Several of the newly created

BET WITH THE GAMBLERS.
The Horse They Backed Was. Always
Sure to Win. Y'Y â .
"When 1 was in Colorado many years
ago," said a New Yorker â . who once , lived
in Denver, "there was apparently no pre
tense at fair play in horseracing. : One
always knew which horse was going to
win by the way the professional gamblers
betted. The horse they bought pools on
always won. V
"Once at a race at Boulder the very
judges left their stand to bet on a horse
named Master John that had lost two
heats. I had already bought a small pool
on the horse and was feeling rather shaky,
but their act reassured . me. Master
John won the next two heats with
an ease that showed he had been pulled
in the previous two. He stumbled, how
ever, in the fourth heat and cut one of his
legs, y When he came out for the fifth heat
he could scarcely put the injured ' leg to
the ground. V It grew worse instead of bet
ter as he limped around the course, but it
was now the â¢ other â¢â -. horse's turn >to â  be
pulled .* in , and â¢ Master <: John y won. He
actually passed the line at the finish on
three legs.
" "People who went often to the races, if
at all observing, finally: noticed that, the
horses which I were backed by men they
knew to be * gamblers * invariably won.
Those given to betting naturally availed
themselves of this knowledge and . backed ,
the same horses. ,y As 1 * confined ; my ' bet
ting to pool buying I: didn't know whose
money I was taking, so I * salved my con
science in ithatway^^^^'-^ ,
"The gamblers finally tumbled to our
game and put up a job on us. V I wasn't
able to go to the races the day they did, so
profited by the experiences of \ my < friends
without loss. Whan "they..; reached the
track " they 'â â 'â  found J all y the V best-known
gamblers * iv. Denver V betting '..-â  vocifer
ously on a certain v horse. Accordingly
they put their money on that horse. To
their great surprise another horse won.
Investigation discoveied that the gamblers
either made but ' small bets , or only pre
tended to bet on the horse they appeared
to back, while they. had understudies who
put ; their money on ..-â  the ; horse which
proved ; the victor. y ""â  -; ,

blers really backed. . One of â¢ the outsiders
at his last race â in Colorado, however, got
on the inside. He owed the driver of one
nt the horses a small bill for livery, as

W^ChbaerleeyPlyCook was the driver of the

The San Francisco Fly-casting Club will
hold a special casting tournament on Sat
urday next at Stow Lake, and handsome
medals will be given to the casters who
succeed in makine' the best average. At

THE NEW UNION-
SQUARE MARKET.
Its Construction Will Be
Commenced in Ten
Days,
AND ENDED IN OCTOBER.
Â«*â¢â 
The Market Men, Tired of Wait-
ing, at Last Decide to *
Remov
INTO thebe-stoey BEICK
Consequently They Cheerfully Sign
Ten Years' Lease With George
Toy.
It is now finally settled that San Fran-
cisco is soon to possess a new modern
market with all the latest equipments and
sanitary devices. The west side of Powell
street, north of O'Farrell, has been se
lected as the most promising site for its
location, and yesterday a ten years' lease
of the property was signed between George
D. Toy, the real estate man, and the Un
ion-square Market Company, a corpora-
tion comprising the principal tenants now
doing business in the old Central Market
at the corner of Sutter street and Grant
avenue.
It was the original intention of D. Sam-
uels to lease the old Batter-street building
from the owner, Frank J. Sullivan. Ne
gotiations between the parties are still
pending, but the market men, tired of the
! delay and the uncertainty of the result,
have at last decided that it would be best
for them, in any event, to accept the offer
of Mr. Toy and remove to a more favor-
able business location. where they could
enjoy the advantages of a long lease at a
reasonable rental, and of a building con-
structed expressly with the view of meet-
ing their requirements.
Plans for the new building are now be-
ing drawn by Hermann & Swain, the
architects. Work udoo it will be begun
in teh days, and by the Ist of next October
It will be finished and ready for occupancy.
It will have a frontage of 68 feet 9 inches
on Powell street, with a depth of 137 feet
6 inches. An L will run to O'Farrell street,
1 giving a frontage there Of 64 feet, 6 Inches.
The building will be of brick, three
j stories high and sixty feet deep in its front
' portion, the remainder being one story
high, with skylights.
The two upper stories will be let for
lodge and office purposes and arranged to
suit the wishes of the tenants.
In its construction and equipment the
new market will in all respects b* fully up
to date, y For these reasons the market
! men are greatly pleased, and Mr. Toy is
' calmly congratulating himself upon the
consummation of a successful stroke of
business, which will make a material addi
tion to the improvements of the City.

PASSES AWAY.
He Expires of Heart Dis-

Came to California in 1849 and
Was Since a Prominent
Man.
CLOSE OP AN HONORED CAREER
As Commander of the Second Brigade
As Commander of the Second Brigade
He Preceded General
Dimond.
General John McComb died of heart
disease at his home in Temescal yesterday
afternoon. General McComb was an old
time newspaper man, who was managing
editor and one of the proprietors of the
Alta California when that journal was well
known to a large circle of California
readers.
In the National Guard General McComb
was known and admired by guardsmen.
He gained promotion gradually and
through all the successive grades from a
non-commissioned officer to brigadier
general commanding the Second Brigade.
He was succeeded as commander of this
brigade by General "W. H. Dimond, and it
is a remarkable fact and cited as a coinci
dence that both generals died on the same
"""".ay.
General McComb's age was 67 years. He
was born in New York, and sprung from
Scotch and Irish stock. He came to Cali
fornia in 1849. On the journey hither he
was a fellow-passenger with George K.
Fitch on the steamer Oregon.
Under the administration of Governor
Perkins the Board of Prison Directors ap
pointed General McComb warden of Fol
som State Prison.
He held the wardenship throughout
Gov. Stoneman's administration, and dur
ing Waterman's regime was transferred to
San Quentin as warden of that prison.
The Prison Directors under the Markham
rule removed him and appointed Warden
Hale.
At the time of his death General Mc-
Comb was secretary of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children. He
was a member of the Union League Club,
past master of California Lodge of Masons,
member of California Commandery of
Knights Templar and the Veterans' Asso
ciation of the National Guard.
During his career as editor of the Alta
his life was threatened by an irate lawyer
named Hayesâ man who had acquired a
reputation as a fierce fighter. A scerie
occurred in the editorial rooms of the old
Alta on California street one night, and
the result was that Hayes got about the
soundest thrashing that a retraction de
mander ever merited.
General " McComb leaven a widow, two
sons, John J. and George &., and a daugh
ter. Miss Lizzie McComb.
Funeral services will bs held at the Ma
sonic Temple at 2p. M. Sunday. The dead

JUDGE HUSE'S CASE AGAIN
His Faithful Friend Gallardo
Makes Another Effort for
His Release.
A David and Jonathan Affection
Between the Two Old Men
- That Is Pathetic.
BAN BERNARDINO. Cal., June 18.â
Another attempt has been made to secure
the release of Judge Charles Huse from
the custody of the Highland Asylum au
thorities. : Y~<"YS"
It will be remembered that early in this
year F. F. Gallardo, a bronzed, grizzled
and picturesque attorney, filed a petition
in the Superior Court of this county asking
for the discharge of his old-time friend
from confinement in the insane asylum at
Highland. The case dragged its weary
length along, and postponement followed
postponement. Witnesses were brought
Santa Barbara and other points up north,
and finally on the 25th of April Judge Otis
denied the prayer of the petitioner and re
manded him to the custody of the asylum
officials.
Gallardo then petitioned the Supreme
Court, and that tribunal promptly decided
against the persistent attorney. However,
be appeared nothing daunted by the re
buffs of the Supreme Court. He is acting
under the advice and instruction of his
friend and instructor, Judge Huse. Yes
terday he appeared in this city, riding the
same sorry-looking horse that first brought
the never-let-up attorney to San Bernar
dino, and late in the afternoon filed his
papers for a second attempt to release
Judge Huse. ...
The petition is for another hearing, and
in law is practically a continuation of
habeas corpus proceedings. The ground
on which the new attempt is based is that
Judge Otis erred and exceeded his juris
diction in the secret examination of Judge
Huse by the physicians appointed for
that purpese. This claim is fully set forth
in the petition, after which prayer is made
that the order remanding Judge Huse to
the asylum be set aside and that he be
Drought before the court in a better posi
tion.
A better position means in this case that
the evidence which was considered be cast
out, and have no effect on whatever pro
ceedings are taken in the present action.
Attorney Gallardo lays particular stress
against the examination of the three phy
sicians, which he believes influenced the
court to make the ruling which was given.
He admits that he has but a poor opinion
of any expert medical testimony, and pre
fers to leave the question of the sanity of
his client to other evidence than that
which was put forth by the examining
board.
Tbe documents are couched in the same
pleasing and peculiar terms which char
acterized the others which were submitted
in the case, and are filled with expressions
equally strong. Gallardo seems to be work
ing wholly lor the love he bears for the
man whom he seeks to release. It appears
to be a Jonathan and David affair brought
down to this practical and prosaic age.
Gallardo says that in case the court re
fuses to grant a new hearing he will make
application to the Supreme Court for a
writ of certiorari and contest the matter
there.-*gppfIgHBBPWiBBBBB
Gallardo says that cases of alternative
remedies are common** and that in in such
cases the petitioner has a choice, and that
he was not given the option in the former
trial or examination. .He also says that
'the original commitment of Judge Hose
was faulty, and that for that reason when
he bad expressed his intention of 'asking
for his release he was discharged from the
Napa : Asylum and - then recommitted.
Huse claims tbat he was not examined in
either case as required by law.
At 10 o'clock .this morning Judge Otis
took up the case and announced that at 2
o'clock he would render his decision.-' At
that hour the petition was denied and At
torney Gallardo will take the j case to the
Supreme Court.

JORDAN IS SENT
TO ALASKA WATERS
Cleveland Appoints Him
Head of an Ex-
pedition.
SEAL AND FISH DATA.
Stanford's President the Only
Western Man Chosen
â¢ for the Work.
ALBATROSS WILL SOON SAIL.
To Be Well Equipped for an Extensive
Scientific Trip of Several
Months.
President David S. Jordan of Stanford
University has b**Â»en appointed by Presi
dent Cleveland to take charge of an im
portant expedition into Alaskan waters to
make an extensive examination of '*, the
seals and fishes about the outlying islands.
The Government Fish Commission
steamer Albatross, now about ready to sail
from this port, has been placed at the dis
posal of. Dr. Jordan and a corps of expe
rienced scientists sent on from Washing
ton to assist him.
It will be one of the most com
pletely equipped expeditions of - the kind
ever prepared for | research ; in the Pacific
Years ago Dr. Jordan was in charge of the
deep-sea dredging and fish-collecting ex
pedition that was carried about by the
Albatross. But this appointment came as
a complete surprise. He was just about to
start East on a lecturing tour, for which
arrangements had already been made at
Indiana University and in Washington
when the telegram arrived from the
President notifying him of his appoint
ment.
Dr. Jordan has long been considered the
American authority on fishes, and this
appointment by the Government is con
sidered only another recognition of the
ability of the head- of the institution at
Palo Alto. Of all the corps selected Dr.
Jordan is the only Western man.
. Stenographers, photographers and cata
loguers will form part of the equipment.
It will be a long voyage, covering much
territory, for the Albatross will visit the
most outlying inlands, of the Alaskan
archipelago. Dr. Jordan hopes to be back
in September, when the university opens.
Mrs. Jordan will not accompany her
husband, but will, now that the summer
plans are so suddenly changed, spend part
of her vacation in Seattle. .
There is no nation in the world, under any
system, where the same reward is given to the
labor of men's hands and the work, of their
brains as in the United States. We lead all
nations in agriculture, we lead all nations in
mining and we lead all nations in manufac
turing. ' These are the trophies which we bring
after twenty-nine years of a protective tariff.
To reverse this system means to stop the prog
ress of the Republic and reduce the masses to
small rewards for their labor, to longer hours
and less pay,' to the simple question of bread
and butter. Free trade, or as you are pleased
to call it, "revenue tariff," means the opening
up of this market, which is admitted to be the
best in the world, to the free entry of the prod
ucts of the world. It means more. It means
that the labor of this country is to be remitted
to its earlier condition and that the condition
of our country is to be leveled down to the con
dition of rival countries, because under it every
element of cost,' every item of production, in
cluding wages, must be brought down to the
level of the lowest paid labor in the world. No
other results can follow and no other result is
anticipated or expected by those who intelli
gently advocate a revenue tariff. We , cannot
maintain ourselves against unequal conditions
without the . tariff and no man of affairs be
lieves we can.â WILLIAM McKINLEY. V

BtTNTiNG Decorationâ Fourth of July, City.
In using bunting for . decoration â  it is proper
that the ; colors should he .;â¢â¢ in the following
order: Blue, white and red, tne blue on top.
In the American flag the blue field takes pre

Sidewalksâ A P. 0., City. Not knowing the
circumstances under which the contract was
let it is impossible to give a direct answer to
your question, but if you think that the con
tractor is not acting legally you may obtain a
judicial decision by commencing an action to
enjoin him from tearing up the sidewalk in
front of your premises and relaying another.
Ballooning.â C, City. It is claimed that
the longest balloon voyage ever undertaken
was one made in 1883. The ascent was made

Auilerriaâ E. G. S., Livermore, Cal.BAlfl
lerria is a name in California for a European

which, under the influence of moisture in the

for it are pin clover and pin grass.
Horse and Lionâ S. M., Alameda, Cal. _It is
asserted that if a strong horse and a lion were
to pull in opposite directions the horse would
pull the lion backward with comparative ease,
but it the lion were hitched behind the horse
and facing in the same direction "and exerted
his strength in backing he would soon pull
the horse upon nis haunches and drag
him, so much greater is his strength when ex
erted backward from the hind legs than in
pulling forward.
Jumpingâ Subscriber, . Santa Rosa, Cal. For
two reasons your question cannot be answered;
one is that the communication does not bear
any signature and the other is that this de
partment does not answer problems, questions
in arithmetic or catch questions, but will say
that if a man jumped off ; a train moving at
the rate of a mile a minute be would not land
directly under the point over which he stood
when he jumped, but would in-all probability
land in the Morgue. â¢ ,

Tuesday for health," etc., is not that which ap
plies to weddings. It refers to the cutting of

Cut them on Monday, cut them for health;
Cut them- on Tuesday, cut them for wealth; '.",',"

Fourth and Marketâ Two Subscribers, City.
Upon the information furnished by. an em
ploye of the Flood building, who stated that
he had been in the building since it was
opened, this department announced that the
Flood building had never been known by any
other name. Upon further . inquiry it was as
certained that for 'R! few days there was in the
space now occupied by. the words : "Flood
Building" the words "Market and Fourth
streets Block," but the words remained such a
short time that the people did not have time
to learn to call the building by that name.
This department desires to be correct, and for
that reason makes this explanation.

FOB PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, Of Ohio
FOB VICE-PRESIDENTâ
V GARRETT A. HOBART, of Hew Jersey
ELECTION NOVEMBER 3, 1896.
McKinley and Hobart.
All hail the next President.
The ticket means prosperity.
The party of the people has named the
winner.
The home is safe when the home indus
try is protected. _
It is to be a marching campaign. Get
in line at the start.
Popular enthusiasm can hardly wait for
the ratification meeting.
America must do all the ratifying for
McKinley. Europe will do the kicking.
No more hard times, no more Cleveland
ismâthe advance agent of prosperity is
coming. ,
The issue is work and wages, and the
result will be prosperity for homes and
firesides. Â£?/<
Silver Republicans should stand firmly
for protection. Let us deal with one thing
at a time.
There is a stalwart Americanism in the
characters of the candidates and in every
principle of the platform.
Tbe Republican version of the Monroe
doctrine in the St. Louis platform is a clear
expression of manifest destiny.
American workingmen might compete
with pauper labor by becoming pauper
laborers themselves, but they won't.
It will not be long now before the wheels
will be moving in every American factory,
ar.d the revival of industry will be real
ized.
This is the last tariff fight of this genera
tion. People will have to forget Cieve
landism beiore they listen to free-traders
any more.
The canvass before us will be painted
with pictures American in every outline
and colored with the brightest hopes of
the people.
Senator Thurston was right in saying,
"This generation has had its object-lesson,
and the doom of the Democracy is already
pronounced."
Protection for the farm, the forge, the
fireside and the ship that sails the sea.
Wherever American labor is there should
protection be.
To make America a great Nation we
must vole for the party of National aspira
tions and for statesmen who are capable
of great things.
The St. Louis convention was National
in the fullest and truest sense, and he is
lacking in National feeling who hesitates
to ratify its action.
In this contest for American labor and
American industry there should be but
one party. All Americans should stand
for America's welfare. -^
The Republican party once more pre
sents the country with a soldier candidate,
and the patriotism of war as well as of
peace is represented in his record.
There is no possibility of conflict be
tween labor and capital in a campaign for
protection. Who works for the welfare of
the one works also for the benefit of the
other.
All through the campaign will be heard
the ringing shouts of workingmen re
joicing in the chance to re-establish pros
perity in the lanjd and comfort in their
homesY^MÃÃp^nEÃÃflfiM
- The voice of the people nominated Mc-
Kinley, and the ballots of the people will
elect McKinley. His administration will
be a government of the people, by the peo
ple, for the people.
After the experience with the Demo
cratic depression this country will vote for
prosperity by a majority .'as: large as
that of intelligent and industrious men
over fools and idlers.
Away with the tariff of sectionalism,
favoritism and deficit revenues. Let us
restore the tariff of Nationalism, protec
tion to all and of revenues abundant for
every need of the Government.
. The speech of Senator Thurston, on tak
ing the chair at St. Louis, is ah epitome
of the spirit and the policy of Republican
ism. It expresses every great and right
ful aspiration of the American people.
All . young patriots who are to cast their
first ballots this year should cast. them for
the . party which, as Senator Thurston
says, represents a "deathless loyalty to all
that is truly American and a patriotism as
eternal as the stars." '
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
The Republicon party celebrates this
year the fortieth anniversary of its birth
as a great , National organism, destined
and devoted to the support of principles
of liberty and justice which are as old as
the race. Like a strong man at its age it
is upon the very summit of vigor, health
and power, and from this eminence it
looks forward proudly and hopefully to a
future as fruitful of splendid = accomplish
ments as its past has been lof glorious
results.
In the weakness of its infancy [the Re
publican party devoted its energies to the
most worthy cause which could command
the loyalty of a party in any land or
under any form of government. . It was
the cause of liberty not for its
members, not for Americans of a
favored ! race, not for men possessing
already guaranteed rights under the Con-
stitutionâ but liberty for four millions of
slaves, members of another race upon
which . the centuries had set the seal
of bondage. Like Hercules in his
cradle, it grappled with the ? ser
pents of personal slavery and political
injustice and crushed them in its strength
ening grasp. If the Republican party
had done nothing more than this during
the first decade of its history it would
have richly deserved the gratitude of man
kind.
But it did more, much more than this.
Amid the doubt and tumult of civil strife
its statesmen clearly perceived and pre
sented those principles which are essen
tial to the life and -growth of the Nation
in war or peace. The very exigencies of
the time made it the more apparent
to Lincoln and Seward and Chase that
the highest destinies of the Republic could
only be realized by making it a great self
sustaining commonwealth ; a "Nation of
freemen bound in loyalty to their country
by its loyalty to them and its constant
protection of their personal, political
and property rights. Hence it was that
contemporaneously with the Republican
party policy of freedom to the slave arose
the Republican party doctrine of protec
tion to American industries, in the in
terest and for the benefit of American
freemen.
The record of the Republican party for
the past forty years furnishes two re
markable facts to students of politics and
to organizers of parties. These are the
consistency of its platforms with each
other and their prophetic forecast of
the Nation's political and commercial
history. Like a pioneer pushing out
into new and fertile lands, the campfire of
the Republican party of to-day has been
the busy center of ideas and activities to
morrow. It is this progressive quality
which furnishes theÃepublicans ample rea
son for pride in their party's past and hope
for its future. It is this which has made
its organization prolific of statesmen and
of leaders. It is this which attracts to its
ranks the young men of the Nation and
renders it the representative of the mov
ing forces and moral ideas of every com
munity in the land. .;;
The Republican party was born among
the people. Its early and its later J leaders
have come up from -below. Its greatest
man and the world's grandest commoner
defined the mission of the Republican
party when he declared at Gettysburg that
"a government of the people, by the people
and for the people should not perish from
the earth." This was the Republican doc
trine of forty years ago. It is the Repub
lican doctrine of to-day and will continue
so to be as long as human rights and
liberties require declaration, protection or
defense. ' '
SILVER REPUBLICANS.
Next to the enthusiasm which marked
the nomination of McKinley the most
notable feature of the St. Louis convention
was the scene in the room of the commit
tee on resolutions when Senators Teller,
Dubois and Cannon with Representatives
Cleveland and Hartman declared they
could not stand with the Republican party
upon a gold platform. The sentiments of ;
these leaders are undoubtedly shared to a
large extent by many Republicans, but !
we doubt if many will follow them in the ,
rash action they have taken in deserting ;
the party of protection in the crisis of its
decisive battle with the advocates of free
trade.
The Call is itself a stanch advocate of
the remonetization of silver, and as such
can with a full sympathy appeal to all
silver Republicans to stand firmly by the
Republican party at this juncture. It is
clear the main issue of tbe campaign will
be that of protection to American industry
and American wages against foreign com
petition. The voice of the people in calling
for the nomination of McKinley called for
protection. There is no appeal from that
demand. We cannot make an issue other
than that which the people have made.
Those ' who have suffered from the hard
times of the Democratic depression need
work and wages to maintain their homes,
and who shall say hey , are wrong in put
ting that need first and foremost before the
country and forcing it to an immediate
issue?
It is worth noting, moreover, that there
is -nothing in the financial plank of the St.
Louis platform that shuts out from .the
party those advocates of the remonetiza-
tion of silver who are moderate in their de-
mands and are willing to proceed accord-
ing to the â â  methods of a discreet states-
manship. The platform says : /."We* are
opposed to the free coinage of silver except
by international agreement with the lead-
ing commercial nations of the world,
which we pledge ourselves to promote."
Here is a distinct pledge that the Mc-
Kinley administration and the Repub
lican parly will do its best to bring about
the establishment of international bimet- ;
allism, and surely all sane silver men
will prefer to trust to that ' pledge rather
than to turn away to join the incompetent
crowds that make up the Democratic and
Populist parties.
There are many ; reasons : for believing
the remonetization of silver can be effected
by international agreement under â¢ the
vigorous leadership of a Republican ad
ministration in , this country. Senator
Hoar of Massachusetts has sent from
Paris the. statement: "I am confident
the time is ripe for the settlement
of the . silver - question and ' the re-estab
lishment of bimetallism 'by. international
agreement, and with the large co-opera
tion of : England." He goes '' on to say he
has had conferences/with leading states
men in England and France, and has been
assured of the hearty assistance of strong
parties in both of those countries to bring
their - Governments Yto 'â 'â¢;â¢â  unite with the
United States in the task of restoring sil
ver to its position as a money metal. y
I There is in fact every inducement to the i
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 19, 1896.
friends of silver to stay with the Repub
lican party and fight out the battle of prof
tection for workingmen in this campaign.
By such a course they will : have â¢ the pro
tectionists with them when the time comes
for them to settle the â  silver question ;; on
its merits. Let us fight one battle at a
time. Teller and his friends will see their
mistake before long. Free silver can gain
nothing by an alliance with free i trade.
Now is the time for all Americans to stand
by the party which, as Senator Thurston"
said, has "a deathless loyalty to all that is
truly American and a patriotism eternal
as the stars."
M'KINLEY AND HOBART.
, The Republican party presents to, the
people in this campaign the Presidential
ticket which the people demanded. The
nomination of McKinley was virtually
made before 'the 'convention 'met.*',. The
delegates assembled, only to satisfy tbe
will of their constituents. That of
Hobart for Vice-President was y almost
equally well assured. The, ticket and
the platform were foretold by The Call
correspondent more- than, a week ago.
Public sentiment was too forcibly declared
to be mistaken. ' Tbe people demanded a.
restoration of the' principle of protection
under the administration of the great
champion of protection, and it will be
with exultant enthusiasm that they ratify,
in mass-meetings all over the Union the
nomination of McKinley and Hobart.
It is an Ideal ; ticket. The candidates
suit the platform, the emergency and the
needs of the country as well as they, suit
the desires and the temper of the people.
William McKinley is one of those soldier
candidates whom the Republican party
delights to honor. His is the patriotism
of war as well as of peace. He was as
prompt to defend the life of the Republic
on the field of battle as to defend
its industries in the , halls of legislation.
He is one of the hero statesmen of the Re
public â one of tlie band of patriotic youth
that enlisted for the war while but little
more than boys, and, after their arduous
service there had closed in victory, devoted
themselves to further service in the field
of statesmanship, and rose to become
honored and famous throughout the length
and breadth of the land.
Among the youngest of our greater
statesmen McKinley is perhaps more
familiarly known than any of them. His
name is literally , a household word. It
has been uttered again and again in every
home in the land during the long, dark
years of Democratic depression. To the
majority of the workingmen of America
his name is synonymous with prosperity.
He is to them the champion of work and
wages, the advocate of the American sys
tem, the man who will set the wheels of
industry running, brighten tbe fireside of
every home and lighten the burdens of
every heart.
The candidate for the Vice-Presidency is
not so well known as the head of the ticket
to the public generally, but they know
him on the Atlantic seaboard. He is the
man who redeemed New Jersey from
Democratic rule and is one of those vigor
ous young Republicans who win victories
even against the greatest odds. His nomi
nation was no accident. His name and in
fluence will add strength even to the strong
name of his leader. It 'will not be long
before his personality is felt in the canvass
and there will be the ring of favor and en
thusiasm in the last as well as in the first
name when the stalwart Republican hosts
send up their . long, , loua, triumphant
shouts for McKinley and Hobart.
NAMED THE WINNERS.
Merely to keep the record , correct, The
Call reminds its readers that on the
morning of Thursday/June 11, its special
correspondent predicted that when the
smoke cleared away from the convention
hall it would be found that William
McKinley of Ohio had been nominated for
President and Garrett A. Hobart of New
Jersey for Vice-President, and that J the
platform would be based upon protection
to the Nation's industries and the gold
standard for tbe redemption money of the
Nation's monetary system.
-This matter is not referred to in the
way of self-glorification, but simply to re
mind the public, although everybody
knows it, that The Call's facilities* for
locating news and for securing it in ad
vance of all contemporaries have no real
competitor. The Call is aware of
the fact that this Is the last
and not the . first end of. the century, and
its appliances and methods for gathering in
and giving out current happenings, as
well as casting a light upon coming events,
must necessarily be up to date. The Calx,
speaks for all, and its correspondents
know where to get the news, get it right
and get it early.
READY FOR THE BATTLE.
The Republican party is in battle array.
William McKinley is the general- in-chief.
Enthusiasm prevails everywhere, and the
grand, army of protection; to Americans
against assaults from foreign wage and
industry destroying competition will go
from strength to strength ' until every ob
struction the Democracy has put in the
way to hinder the people's progress is
removed beyond all possibility of re
turning. pBBBHSBBBBHHHHBa
The harmony which characterized the
work of the convention shows how ear
nestly the Republican party will take hold
of the work of lifting the country out of
the mire and clay of business distress into
which Democratic incapacity and venality
have plunged it. It iis a mighty task "to
repair so many breaches in the avenues
and channels of tho Nation's trade and
traffic, but the Republican party is equai
to it, and the work will be done speedily
and thoroughly.
The years of Democratic rule since
March, 1893, have seen only * the ; turning
back of the Nation's wheels of commercial
and industrial progress, but in a few
months they, will roll forward scattering
everywhere substantial evidence that the
same principles of government which in
creased the Nation's wealth from $15,000,
-000,000 to $70,000,000,000; in three short
decades are again in full operation for the
betterment of the condition of every man,
woman and child in all this broad land.
Surely there is occasion for rejoicing
everywhere, and there is rejoicing every.
where. The ) Republican candidate for
President of the United States stands more
distinctly and emphatically for true Amer
icanism than did any of his predecessors.
In ; their . campaigns they were confronted
by a Democratic .theory,* but as President
they/ had only ito continue 'in a ] general
way an established policy. But President
McKinley and the Republican representa
tives 'in > Congress will be; confronted ; by
the consequences of \ four } years of ' Demo
cratic theories of Government in practical
operation. The election of (ai Democratic
administration in 1892 was an experiment'
which the people thought they would try.
It is not likely that they will ever try an
other with that party. ' "
"We have said the next President will be
William McKinley, but not necessarily so.
While it may be said without fear of con
tradiction from any intelligent source that
an overwhelming majority of â ' the people
of the United States want and expect j Mr.
McKinley to be elected, it is ..equally true
that danger of defeat lies in the confidence
of the people that he will be elected in any
event. ylt would require but a very
few in each .voting district to conclude
that their votes were not needed, and stay
away from the polls, to turn what should
be a briliant victory ' into; a humiliating
defeat, y The most disgraceful i and inex
cusable defeat is the defeat by default. Y,y
ylt is the : duty ,of every voter, without
reference to ' past . or present party affilia
tion, who, wants to see the several lines of

and . stable basis and who wants to see the

which 'shall insure its distribution among
the people â each one receiving according
to the honest effort he has made â to place
himself in the ranks that are fighting to
broaden, and deepen opportunities for re
munerative employment in every field of
labor that is now open or may hereafter.
be developed.
WHAT IT STANDS TOR.
: The platform of the National Repub
lican party provides for the betterment of
the conditions of existence of every citizen
of the . United . States as contemplated in
that expression of the Declaration of Inde-.
pendence which claims ; for man the right
of life, liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness. And since the greatest danger to
man's advancement from degree to degree
in possessing himself of" those things
which are most conducive to the perma
nency of his right of life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness lies in the aggressive
ness of the would-be invader, the platform
anticipates the purpose of the intruder by
makingl protection against all such an
tagonism the warp and woof of the party's
declaration of principles.
No interest or need overlooked. From
the obscure laborer working in the dark
ness of the mine to the greatest aggrega
tion of capital, the Republican party
encourages by guaranteeing the full
strength of the Nation's strong arm,
should it be needed in defense of the
promise of the Nation's declaration of per
sonal liberty. The name, the honor and
the welfare of the people, individually and
collectively, will . be guarded at every pos
sible point of attack, while every one who
sows shall reap in peace the full of his
effort. A National revenue adequate to
meet the expense of maintaining the Gov
ernment and to gradually pay off the
Nation's debts will be provided, but in a
way that shall give the greatest , possible
encouragement to the people to expand
their business enterprises. -
Reciprocal trade relations will be estab
lished with such nations as commodity
interchanges will be mutually advan
tageous, arid such substantial aid to
American ships will be given as shall en
able them to gather under the stars and
stripes the country's ocean carrying trade.
That is to say, the commerce of the United
States shall no longer be dependent upon
foreign shipyards for water-transportation
facilities to carry'our goods and wares to
customers beyond the seas and fetch from
them such articles of merchandise as are
needed by us.
The railway systems of the country
having grown to such proportions, the
Republican party will undertake the
supervision of their conduct to the extent
of revising transportation traffic tariffs
that the people may be protected against
the avariciousness of corporate power.
The old soldier will be held in grateful
remembrance for protecting the Nation
against the , vicious \ intent of treasonable
conspirators, and 'the old flag for which
they fought will hereafter be all the guar
antee of personal safety an American
citizen will want anywhere on earth. In
short, the platform of the Republican
party stands for the peace, the happiness
and the prosperity of all the people.
FOR A MERCHANT MARINE.
One of the most interesting planks of the
St. Louis platform, next to protection, of
course, is the one declaring for the restor
ation of the merchant marine by direct or
indirect subsidy. It is hard to conceive
what tbe growth of San Francisco would
be, commercially and numerically, in the
next ten years under a system, of ocean
freight carriers sailing from and to the
Pacific Coast's metropolis. There is noth
ing that hinders San Francisco becoming
the second center of commercial import-
ance in this hemisphere but ample : facili-
ties to reach the countries bordering on
the Pacific Ocean. A well-supported mer-
chant marine would make this city one of
the chief ship-building centers of the con
tinent, and moreover, it would remove the
present comparative isolation of California
and' bring not only the State but the
whole American-coast country of the Pa
cific in close touch with millions of foreign
people and thousands of foreign trade
centers.
But the Republican party is pledged to
accomplish all this for California, and
equally as much for the whole country,
and yif for .no other reason the people
; should rise in their might and firmly seat
the chosen representatives of that party In
the Nation's places of official trust. Y. With
a strongly intrenched line of ocean craft
on the Pacific -Ocean, and a \ passageway
for them across Nicaragua, there is no
doubt at all that the population of Cali
fornia would be douoled in a few years..
The importance, "'therefore, to not only
Calif ornians but to those who will make
this State their home, of giving opportu
nity to put \ into practical operation the
theory of a Pacific Ocean merchant marine
is too apparent to enable any one to frame
an excuse for ; not giving the proposition a
practical application.
THE MONROE DOCTRINE.
r The . St. Louis platform reasserts the
Monroe doctrine ; with V great emphasis.
The events growing out of the Venezuelan
affair have shown how impotent 'the
Democratic party is to handle international
questions, which; together with the arro
gant aggressiveness of England, induced
by the administration's apparent timidity,
made ; it nnecessaryy y for the Republican'
party" to put its : interpretation of the doc-
trine y with so much clearness that Great
Britain will I know exactly what to expect
when Mr. McKinley becomes the executive
head of the nation.
Yv-It is a fundamental *" principle of /this
Government that territorial extension ;of
European nations .upon this continent by
purchase or conquest would be an attack
upon the republican forms of government
and that the United States could not have
its own safety dr the safety. of any republic
in this hemisphere ' endangered by permit-
ting a y monarchy to get a foothold. Of
course, the Republican platform does not
intend to be understood as meaning that
American provinces of foreign powers are
held ; unlawfully, but it '{ does -' mean that
such t possessions * shall 'â ' not be used as a
pretext to acquire more territory.
The sympathy of the Â« Republican party
with Cuba as expressed in the platform is
participated ',; in by every true lover of | lib-
erty, right and justice. 'The declaration
is not? a threat,; but it insists that 'the
people of Cuba have the right ~to feel that
they can rely implicitly upon the y influ
ence of the United States with Spain to
I deal justly and grant them such liberty as ,
they are entitled to, even to the extent if
heed be "'. of recognizing their belligerency,
together with the sympathy of the people
of this country, in a form so ; substantial
that it would De the eauivalent of men,
money and guns. BSmBSSEBI
THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM.
After reading the platform of the op
posing school of politics, which was adopt
ed in convention at Sacramento yesterday,
any fair-minded man would suggest that
for its own good and the State's advantage
the Democracy of California should merge
itself into the Republican party, at least
during the present campaign. The
Sacramento platform voices nearly
every declaration of the Republican
party yas concerning the needs of
California, and in y substantially 'the
same language that was employed
by the Republican State Convention a few
weeks ago. ylt is almost line upon line
and precept upon precept, nor is it exactly
a theft of the livery of the court of heaven
to serve > the cloven-footed Democracy in ;
but, however : the convention happened to
adjust its platform to the principles enun
ciated by the Republican party only the
other I day, the , theme of the ; old hymn,
." While V the lamp holds out to burn the
vilest sinner may return," is strengthened
from center to circumference. ' The Demo
cratic party of California is to be congrat
ulated for ,{ evincing . a disposition to get
nearer abreast of the civilization of the
nineteenth century.
. Ths Republican party of California de
clared for the free and unlimited coinage
of silver. The Democracy follows suit,
and declares for the same thing.
The Republican party declared against
what is known as the refunding bill of the
Pacific ' railways. The Democratic party
now comes to the front, and says it, too, is
opposed to the bill. Â '
The Republican party declared against
the Southern Pacific's "bossy" methods in
California politics. The Democratic party
comes along with a similar declaration.
The Republican party demanded the
construction of the Nicaragua canal at
the earliest time possible. , The Demo
cratic party has come to the conclusion
that the canal should be pushed to com
pletion as rapidly as possible.
The Republican I party pointed out how
the industries of California are unduly de
pressed,* and recommended the immediate
return to protection ; that protects, and a
merchant marine sufficiently backed by
the General Government to control the
Pacific Coast ocean carrying trade. The
Democracy now admits that California in
dustries are greatly depressed, but it does
not appear to know bow to remedy the
evil. This is tbe first divergence from the
plans and specifications of the Republican
party to restore the State to its old-time
power and influence in the commercial
world.
The Republican party declared for pro
tection to labor and pointed out that the
way to protect American labor : was to
shut out all labor competition that com
peted by cutting down wages. At this
point the Democracy made its second
divergence from the Republican party's
list of declarations. It could suggest noth
ing better than "a tariff for revenue only"
that is, the same .kind the country has
been enjoying for three years and which
has failed to provide enough revenue to
support the ! Government by $150,000,000.
besides increasing the bond debt of the
country $262,000,000, to say nothing ; of the
hundreds of thousands of good, sober and
honest wage-earners who have been thrown
out of employment by its operation. , '.
V Therefore the Democratic party of Cali
fornia having indorsed all the principles
of the Republican party, except the one of
tariff, it follows that the tariff question is
the only issue that the parties can go be
fore the country upon.
The Republican party choerfully enters
the arena of the common-sense of the peo
ple as the champion of the principle of
protection in the , case of protection vs.
free trade. There would be no sense at all in
discussing any other principle of govern
ment than that of the tariff, for every
other declaration of the Republican party
has been accepted by the Democracy as
its political creed. Now for the hustings.
THE BEST NEWS SERVICE.
The Call scored still another triumph
over its contemporaries yesterday morn
ing, when its special train carried
its big convention edition into the
city of Santa Cruz seven hours in
advance of any other San Francisco
morning newspaper. . The , train shot
into San Jose just fifty-seven minutes
after the start and to The Call's host of
readers in the Garden City the magnifi
cent paper had been distributed before 5
o'clock in the morning. The run to Santa
Cruz in two hours and fifty-eight minutes
broke all previous records over the line by
a full half hour, and there was enthusiastic
delight among the thousands of visitors to
the seaside carnival when they awoke to
welcome The Call that conveyed to them
the latest and most complete and. faithful
details of the St Louis convention, as well
as the news of tbe world, at about the
same hour that the carriers in this City
were finishing their daily rounds.
But The Call's record-breaking feats of
yesterday did not end there. Its special
bulletins from the National Convention
ball in the : Missourian metropolis were
given to the people of San Francisco : con
tinuously in advance of all rivals, and the
news ;of the . nomination , of William Mo'
Kinley was posted in front of the business
office of The Call on Market ' street i three
minutes after . the announcement . was
made by Chairman Thurston in St. Lou:;:.
When the mighty cheers arose from tbe
throng in front of The Call office as the
result of the ballot for. Presidential
nominee was laid before them on
the canvas, the City received its first
thunderous notification that the y Ohio
statesman had been confirmed *' as X the
standard-bearer of the * Republican : party
in the campaign of 1896. y The Call â  bul
letins were full, accurate and prompt. As
The Call was first with its ' special train
on the scene of the Venetian Fiesta, so it
was first ail the day in its bulletin service.
Verily shall it '; be said, supported by uni
versal evidence of popularity, that "The
Call speaks for all."
V: When the prosperity of *. the ' home is es
tablished, when work is plenty and wages
ape high, then the people can turn to new
issues and settle the money question in
accordance with the everlasting right.
The Republican party maintained our
financial system in operation without run
ning country into debt to keep up the
gold reserve, and when restored to po-ver
will continue to do so. Yj^^^^^mSHÃ
It is into this vast field of home trade â at!
once [the creation and the j heritage â of the
American] people that foreign nations are

field that th* opponents of our present revenue
system' would} freely .admit] the countries of
Europe countries into whose internal trade
we could not reciprocally enter; countries to
which we should \be surrendering \ every ad
vantage of trade; from which we should be

THE RAISING OF
THE BALIMORE.
Henry Synstrand's Body
Recovered by One of
the Divers.
WAS ASLEEP IN HIS BUNK
INo Progress Was Made on the
Wreck, as the Pumps
Gave Out
CAPTAIN BURNS IS DISGUSTED.
Arrival of the Mail Company's New.
port After a Smart Run From
New York.
Another determined effort to raise the
Blairmore was ' made , yesterday. It was
only partly successful, as the tide came
up and work had to be discontinued.
More of the vessel was out of the water
than at any time since she turned over,
and had. the pumps not choked up the
chances are that now she would be in
shallow water and ready to be operated on.
It took some time to get the new pump
in position. When it was in working
order the others broke down. The com
pressor worked well, however, and the
forward part of the ship rose until, the
bowsprit was clear out of the water. Had
the plunger not given out it and the new
pump would have cleared the after hold of
the sunken ship of water and she would
have floated inshore. :-'YY
After last Sunday's failure but little
worg was done except in the way of re
pairing damages. New hawsers were bent,
and to make sure that there would not be
another breakaway the big mooring chain
of the sunken ship was made fast to the
wrecker and then to the Biairmore's cap
stan. The strain on it was enormous,
and the planking of the Whitelaw's fore
castlehead opened up under it. Every
thing held, however, and at 3 p. m. the
sunken ship was almost in the same posi
tion as she was last Sunday when the tide
rip struck her. She is again heading al
most due west and is higher out or the
water than ever before. Captain Burns is
determined to keep at work on her all
night, and if all goes well she will be in
shallow water at noon to-day. '
All of yesterday tbe tug Liberty sup
plied steam for the operating of the steam
pumps, and at noon the Monarch put in
an appearance to help to move the wreck.
Captain Dan Thompson soon got a haw
ser connected with the ship, and he at
once began hauling. For five hours the
work was continued, but no impression
was made, as the stern was imbedded in
the mud and could not be moved. When
the pumps are all in working order the
hold will be cleared of water and then the
vessel will come up. -:::. f :
The body found in the forecastle by the
diver last Tuesday was recovered yester
day and taken to the Morgue. It was
identified as the remains of John Syn
strand, tbe watchman. As stated in The
Call, be was asleep when the ship turned
over. Captain Caw went ashore from the
wreck yesterday and made all the arrange
ments for the funeral, which will take
place to-day.
The Alaska Packers' Association steamer
Royal left here on April 21 last for
Alaska, and fears were entertained for her
safety. The company is now in receipt of
information to the effect that the Royal
was at Chignik on May 11, and had landed
her passengers several days previously at
Fort Simpson. The steamer is undoubt
edly safe, and may be expected back here
early in August.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
Newport arrived from. New York via
Panama and way ports yesterday. The
run from Newport News to Panama was
made in thirty-nine days, and is the fast
est on record. On April 20 George Cleve
land, one of the cabin-boys, died, and was
buried -at sea. Five days later Captain
Carver of the American ship Charles R.
Flint, his wife and thirty-one of his crew
were picked up in midocean. The Flint
was from New York for Shanghai with a
million cans of kerosene aboard.
When off the Brazilian coast the cargo
caught fire. In thirty minutes she was a
mass of flames and the men had hard
work getting away on the boats. % For tour
days they were on short allowance and
then . the Newport picked them " up and
landed them at Panama.
The Harbor Commissioners held a short
session yesterday. Commissioner Cole is
at the St. Louis convention, so very little
business of importance was done. The
contract for the building of ferry slip 1
was let to Healy, Tibbitts & Co. for $1273.
The San Francisco and North Pacific Rail
road Company asked for a reduction in
wharfage charges on crushed stone, which
the directors propose bringing from one of
the company's quarries along the line.
The matter was taken under advisement.
As soon as Mr. Colo returns a number of
changes will be made on the front and the
wharfingers and collectors are expecting a
lively time of it. .
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Ala
meda, which sails for Sydney, N. S. W;,

be left behind. Nat Goodwin's company,
twenty all told, will be : among the pas
sengers, and as many others are also going
the favorite Mail . steamer will . have a
large passenger-list.

DYNAMITE USED
IN THE MISSION.
Attempt to Wreck a Build-
ing on Valencia
Street.
LITTLE DAMAGE DONE.
The Building Is Occupied as a
Real-Estate Office and
Fruitstore.
POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING.
So Far There Is No' Definite Clew to
the Perpetrator of the
Outrage.
The police are investigating what has the
appearance of an attempt to destroy a
building at 1402 Valencia street by the use
of dynamite.
â¢The building is on the corner of Twenty-?
fifth street, and is occupied by J. F. Plumbe,
real-estate agent, and H. J. Watson, fruit
dealer, whose number is 1404. . . â¢'
About 10 o'clock Wednesday night peo
ple in the vicinity heard a loud explosion
in the building. Among those who hur
ried to the scene were Police Sergeant John
Mooney and Policeman Young.
V : In the passsge-way alongside Plumbe's
office they- found a gunny-sack partly
burned and about three feet of fuse. Ten
small panes of glass in the windows of
Watson's fruitstore', which overlooked the
passage-way, were, shattered, and in the
cigar-store Inside the building several
small glasses were broken.
. Sergeant Mooney sent Policeman Young
to Plumbe's residence to tell him of the
explosion. Young returned and informed
the sergeant that Plumbe did not seem to
care much and said he was not going to
the store, but gave him tbe key.
Almost immediately afterward Plumbe
made his appearance and Mooney asked
him for : the key i' to; the room outside of
which the explosion had' taken place.
Plumbe replied, that he did not know
where the key was; tbat it had been hang
ing or. the wall, but was not there.
Plumbe then took a key he had taken
from the wall, but failed to. unlock the
door. Mooney asked him if he did â  not
know the key to the room and he said he
did not.' Mooney then took the key from
him and unlocked the door quite easily
with it. An examinrtion was made of the
room, but nothing was found to have been
disturbed. y
The sergeant took possession of the
gunny-sack and fuse and reported- the af
fair to Captain Gillen, who sent his report
yesterday morning to police headquarters.
Fire * Marshal Towe was communicated
with and he went to the scene of th' explo
sion. After making 'an investigation he
came to the conclusion it was a matter for
the police and not for him.
About the same time another explosion
occurred in the rear of 1337 Valencia street,
where a Republican meeting was being
held, but no damage was done. Plumbe is
a prominent member of the club, but
whether that bad anything to do with
either explosion is merely a matter of con
jecture.'. :". â "''.'.-
It is a wonder that the Plumbe building
was not wrecked, and the small amount of
damage done is a surprise to those who
have looked the scene over. Captain Gil
len will strain every ; point to unravel the
mystery. _____ ___________

Are you getting out of tea what you
ought to : pleasure and wholesome stim-

reason why you should not ; but do you ?
Why do doctors talk against certain
teas? Is it because they are good for
the body ?
Why do Americans drink less and less
tea every year ? Is it because tea is bet-
ter and better every year ?
No ; tea is not getting better and better
every year. It has been getting worse
and worse less pleasure in it ; less health
in it. . x
This is your fault and the fault of tea-
makers. You demand pretty tea when
what you really want is good tea. Tea-
makers give you what you want.
Result : colored tea which is bad for

THE LADIES WILL
NOT BE IN IT.
They Cannot Get Tickets
for the Corbett-Shar-
key Fight.
J. J. GROOM'S EDICT.
William Greer Harrison and His
Friends Call on the
Champion.
HOW HE ENTERTAINED THEM
Thomas Sharkey Has Limbered Up
Quite Wonderfully and Is in
Great Shape.
Ladies will not be permitted to attend
the Corbett-Sharkey fight on the 24tb.
That is a settled thing in the mind of J.
J. Groom and others in charge of the
affair, and it is their desire that this be
come known soyas to avoid further trou
ble.
.. "Nearly the first man in line when the
sale of seats began last Monday morning, 'â'
Groom stated yesterday in his own pecu
liar way of putting " it, "was a young
woman.
"I asked her what * sbe wanted, and she
said 'Three tickets,' at - the same time she
produced $15.
-"Now, we don't want women to see this
affair. It isn't their place. We want
men, not women or even boys to be in at
tendance.
"I told the lady about it and she was
very nice not to get angry, although she
said it was a great disappointment to her
and her two lady friends, who intended
seeing. the contest.
"Since Monday I suppose there must
have been fifty. women who have made an
attempt to purchase tickets, but we have
invariably refused â¢to sell them any. "â . Of
course,* if on the ;. night of y the ;; contest
women i present tickets of .'admission we
will have to honor 'them, but I do hope
that this will not occur, as women would
be J entirely out iof i place â â¢ among such a
mass of men as will bis present.'.'
Now that the Olympic Club has decided
Jim Corbett's right to a special room in
which to do bis exercising the situation
is better \ defined . and the members who,
heretofore, y became anery ~ because they
could not witness him at his work, are now
content. %
? But the courtesy . granted Jim has had
no effect in decreasing the attendance lat
his sparring sessions. Instead of a throng
of men whom he bad never met before, he
was surrounded yesterday by friends of
long ago and representative people.
William Greer Harrison. Jim's best
friend and supporter for *. years, ; called on
the champion during the afternoon. He
was accompanied ** by quite ; a \ number *of
prominent people, and although Jim had
already gone throueh his exercise, be went
at it again for their benefit, sparring with
Bob ; McCord and Van Buskirk a round of
ten minutes each and "one of seventeen
minutes with George Green.
In Mr. Harrison's party were : Governor
Boyd of Nebraska, Dr. Bray f ogle of New
York, Colonel Lee of the United States
army, Colonel Haddocks, Larry Coleman,
J. H. Black and Dr. Whitwell.
. In connection with* Bob McCord, it may
be stated that when Jim Corbett . started
out in bis career as a pugilist he accompa
nied the Tuxedo Company, McCord being
his sparring partner. It was during this
engagement, in 1892, that Corbett chal
lenged John L. Sullivan for the champion
ship of the world, and deposited $1000 with
the New York Herald as a guarantee of
good faith.-
; While Corbett is receiving much atten
tion â at the hands of his friends on this
side, Tom Sharkey is also being lionized
on the other side of the bay. His .quiet
ways have made him any amount of
friends. He is training conscientiously
and well limbered up. He does not go in
very much for boxing apparently, believ
ing that no matter how much he can im
prove himself he will not cut much of a
figure against the champion. But the
running he indulges in every day j and the
handball be plays are doing' him good and
strengthening his wind.

State Senator Sam Jones is reported as
being on his way to this City as the repre
sentative of his brother, Senator John P.
Jones of Nevada, and his object is said to
be to take immediate measures for the
opening and development of the great
Mariposa grant, of which the Senator from
Nevada is a half-owner. The other owners
of the grant are Alvinza Hayward, the
Hobart estate and John W. Mackay, who
each own one-third of the remaining half.
It was erroneously reported about two
weeks ago that the grant had been sold to
an English party for $10,000,000, but this
is emphatically denied >by John W.
Mackay, who said there was nothing in
the report, and he further intimated that
an offer of twice that amount would not
be considered. The owners, who represent
a combined capital of over a hundred mil
lions of dollars, have determined, it is
said, to inaugurate development on the
most extensive scale on their own account
and to throw open the immense grant to
agricultural settlers, and to not only place
the old mines which have been allowed to
sink into decay on a basis that will allow
mining on modern principles, but to open
up new mines in all that portion of the
frant which is included in its mineral
elt. The famous mother lode reaches its
fullest development in the Mariposa
grant, and over one-fifth of the total area
is mineral.
In the early days Trenor W. Park
opened up the Josephine, Pine Tree and
Princeton mines, and in less than two
years is said to have taken out over $2,000,
-000. The ore in the Princeton averaged
over $150 to the ton of reÂ« milling ore, the
refractory ore and low grade not being
treated at all. The Princeton was de
veloped only to a depth of 400 feet by an
incline 750* feet in length, and when the
mine was shut down there were vast ore
bodies developed. The deeper they got
the richer they became. The Josephine
and Pine Tree mines were less perfectly
developed than the Princeton, "but the
prospects in them were said to be quite
equal to that one. It is stated that one of
the projects for improving the grant will
be the . construction of an electric road
from Merced to Hornitos, a distance of less
than forty miles. This road will ulti
mately be extended to Mariposa, the
county seat of Mariposa County.
The Mariposa grant, or the old Fremont
grant, as it is sometimes called, was lo
cated by General Fremont early in the
history of the State. Fremont secured
from the Mexican Government the right
of location to eleven square leagues which
he at first appropriated on the agricul
tural lands of the San Joaquin Valley, but
afterward, when gold was discovered in
the country, he surrendered his first loca
tion and transferred his lands to Mari
posa County, now embraced in the cele
brated grant. His title was confirmed and
he was granted a patent in 1855. There
are included in the boundaries of the
grant 48,840 acres. It is an irregular body
of land bounded on the north by the Mer
ced River and has a length from north to
south of fourteen miles and a width of
twelve. Three towns, Mariposa, Prince
ton and Bear Valley, are located on the
grant and in the days of Park were thriving
to the highest degree. Now, owing to the
total cessation of all mining, these towns
afford the most melancholy examples of
utter stagnation that are to be found in
the State.
Fremont sold the grant to an English
party for $800,000, who again disposed of
it to a company of New Yorkers, whose
â  experience in . managing mines was un
fortunate, and they relinquished their
claims to others, of whom the late Peter
J. Donahue and .Mark Brummagen were
partners. Ultimately years of litigation
ensued, and in 1886 the present owners
purchased it at a price below $500,000.
One of the projects for development is to
be an irrigation canal drawing water from
the Merced River, from the dam at
Horseshoe Bend, and irrigating a great
part of the agricultural lands in the grant.

The St, George's Club at 317 Mason street
The St George's Club at 317 Mason street
is considering the question of professional
athletics, in other words, some of the
prominent members propose giving a box
ing tournament. With this object in view
they are now seriously thinking of con
summating a match between Paddy Slavin
and Joe Choynskiâ that is, provided a li
cense can be got and will be approved by
Acting Mayor Taylor, who recently stated
that after the Corbett and Sharkey contest
he would veto the ordinance recently
passed by the Supervisors licensing boxing
exhibitions. ...
The. St. George's Club is composed in
major part of young Britishers who have
an innate love' for all kinds of athletics.
Now that boxing has taken such a strong
hold on the community the St. George's
Club is anxious to be in ; the swim. Secret
tary Oliver and- Ray Brown are sanguine
that under the auspices of the club they
represent some very excellent . entertain-
ments can be witnessed occasionally.
The members, or at least a large Per-
centage of them, are in favor of athletic
â¢entertainments. Mr. â ]â  Oliver has stated
that the club is not looking forward to any
'gain accruing from a F boxing â  exhibition.
On the contrary it does not expect to en
rich its treasury in that way, and the sole
object of matching professional boxers is
to give the members an opportunity >of
witnessing < occasionally a. short :. series of
contests between some of the most promi
nent of the local pugilists."
. William Greer Harrison," who accepted
some time ago at the solicitation of the
members the . office of honorary president
of the St. George's Club, said yesterday
that he was in no wise connected with the
boxing scheme which is now in a state of
incubation. y
"I have taken a special interest in the
St. George's Club," said Mr. â¢ Harrison,
"because it is an organization which has
accomplished much good in : its way. I
refused to be â¢ a candidate for : president
simply because I have not got the time
necessary to devote to an office of ' that
kino. To conduct a club properly the
president must give it considerable of his
time and attention, ' and as I have my
hands full at present I could not think of
accepting the presidency of such a promi
nent organization. . jÂ£lptlii^;Y
"I am of the opinion, however," he con
tinued, "that the St. Georee's Clubshould
stick to its original plan, the principles of
which are sociability and goodfellowship.
The club has accomplished invaluable ser
vice in educating the young men of Great
Britain who have sought foreign homes.
It has also provided many positions for
its countrymen, and I am seriously of the
opinion that it would be taking a very sen
sible and sportsmanlike view of the situ
ation if it omitted professional . athletics
from its programme of amusements.
However, I have nothing whatever to say
in the matter, as I am, only an honorary
member.
"What do you think of the Corbett and
Sharkey contest, Mr. Harrison was
asked.
"Oh, well, I am not a judge, you
know." said the ex-president of the Olym
pic Club, with a wink and a smile, both of
which were significant in their way.
"I am sure, however, that Corbett will
give a good account of himself," he con
tinued, "and I am also positive that Shar
key has enough of the genuine Irish blood
flowing in his veins to keep him on his
feet while his equilibrium remains
balanced. lam satisfied that he will not
emulate the tactics of George Robinson,
the big faint-hearted Olympian who
crawleu on the floor before the man from
whom Corbett wrested the championship
of the world."

George's Club met last evening and de
cided to send the following telegram to

MRS. ZIEGER DISCHARGED
The Self-Confessed Murderess of
Her Infant Again at
Liberty.
Judge Low Decides, After Hearing Her
Statement, That She May
Go Free.
Mrs. â¢ Martha Zieger, the woman who
confessed to participating in - the murder
of her newly born - infant on December 7
last, was discharged from custody yester
day. .
Detective Dillon and' Policeman Ryan,
who have been working on the case, have
been unable to find Harry Sutter, the
woman's accomplice. He left the City on
Saturday last, after learning of Mrs.
Zieger's arrest, and apparently intends to
keep away.
Mrs. Zieger was -taken before Judge Low
yesterday morning by order of Chief
Crowley. Dillon and Ryan were present,
and Corporal Geimann, a - clerk in the
Chiefs office, read to the Judge a state
ment made to him by Mrs. - Zieger after
her arrest in which she admitted trying to
choke the child about an hour and a half
after its birth because Sutter told her it
would be better to get rid of it. Sntter
became impatient and struck the , infant
on the head with his fist. He then took
it away and she had not heard what be
came of it. TBtMS"_Pl_l_W
The Judge asked Mr 3. Zieger a few ques
tions, which were interpreted by Gei
mann, as she does not understand the
English- language. She Â« stated in " an
swer to his questions, that she pressed the
baby's chest instead of choking it, and
Sutter struck it on the face.
As there was no crime apparent, the
Judge decided there was no use in swear
ing to *a; complaint against Mrs. : Zieger.
The body of the infant, had not been
found, and there was nothing to show
what became of it unless Sutter could be
found. He accordingly signed an order
for Mrs. Zieger's release from custodv." Y; 'â â 
Every effort will be made by the police
to find Sutter, and if arrested he will -be
charged with murder. â¢'â

work had been carried on ' expeditiously
from the start, and general satisfaction
prevailed at the results attained.
At the morning session the principal
feature was the election of officers for the
ensuing year. Much enthusiasm pre
vailed, and though many of the contests
were spirited, perfect good nature and
brotherly harmony prevailed.
Officers for the ensuing year were elected
as follows.
Noble grand arch, James A. Devoto, San.

session, the incoming noble grand arch,
James A. Devoto, being privileged to place
any one he pleased in that position.
A city relief board will be organized, and
two or more in every place where two or

At this session . a few communications
were read and approved, and a testimonial
of a j beautifully inscribed gold watch was'
presented to O. H. Hoag, the retiring noble
grand arch. He was highly complimented
for the efficiency he had shown in the

COAL DRAWBACK SETTLED
The Federal Government Wins
in the Famous Allen
Suit.
Several Million Dollars Saved by a
, Recent Decision of the Su
preme Court.
The Supreme Court of the United States,
in the suit of Charles R. Allen against the
Government for certain drawbacks in coal
importations, reversed on Monday â last
the decision of the District Court and the
Court jof Appeals and remanded - the case
to the lower court for judgment, with
costs, in favor of the Government. â 
The decision indirectly involved several
million dollars, though the suit just de
cided by the highest court in the land '.was
merely to ' recover the r sum of $97. The
Government lost in the two lower courts,
but, confident of its position, appealed the
case to the highest legal- authority in the
land, securing a verdict in its favor. \y -
It seems that in the early part of 1893
Allen imported certain bituminous coals,
paying the duty provided by law. In time
Allen sold some of the coal :to a certain
coastwise steamer and immediately de
manded a drawback of 75 cents a ton, as
provided in the act of March 3, 1883, which
reads as follows: . '
y "Drawback of 75 cents a ton shall be
allowed on all bituminous coals imported
into the United States which is : afterward
used for fuel on board of \ vessels propelled
â¢by steam which are 'engaged in the coast
ing trade of the United States or in trade
with foreign countries, to be allowed and
paid under such regulations as the Secre
tary of the Navy may prescribe." - y
y -<; The Collector filed \ the demand and in
time \ reported the matter to Washington.
The department held that Mr/ Allen was
not entitled to receive a drawback, owing
to y the - fact that the V law was : never ; in
tended to cover : such â  claims as he pre- ,
sented . â â :-'-*-';â¢;â â â¢ â '::-.:â '
.' -The : importer immediately instituted
suit in .the District Court to recover the
sum of : $97, alleged ': to 'be .due as a draw-
back jj for coal sold ;Â» to a coas.t % steamer.
The case; was fought by the Government
with 7 much earnestness, resulting, how
ever, . in '< a . verdict ! for , tbe * plaintiff. â¢ An
appeal was then taken to the Court of Ap
peals, that tribunal sustaining the lower
court. < As * a :; last resort ' the Government

his decision. If it is adverse to the plaint
iffs they must seek consolation in the Su
preme Court; if in their favor, then the
defendants will have an opportunity to
prove the operation of the statute of lim
itations..
At the opening of Court yesterday Judge
McKinstry stated . that Mr. Lane had con
sented to allow him to make the opening
argument, as he was anxious to get away
from town. He said it would only occupy
a few minutes, and Judge Sanderson con
sented to hear him.
Judge McKinstry opened his argument
by reading the grant of Pico to Noe. He
laid particular emphasis upon those por
tions of the grant wherein it; was stated
the property was given to him. He also
called attention to the conditions of the
grant. He then cited the case of Scott
against Moore. In this case a Mexican
donation was ; made under conditions
similar to those* of the Noe grant. In this
case it was held that these clauses were
not onerous and there was nothing in
them making the donation a grant. The
conditions did not change the donation to

Board of Land Commissioners was^H

pointed. Their duties did not â  consist
only in passing upon full and complete
rights, but they were to pass upon claims
of all kinds. The title which a man has
to property which he has presented for
confirmation to the Land Commissioners
lies in the patent which he receives ;of
the United States. When a man has re
ceived a patent ; no one can come in and
claim a title adverse to him. Don Jose
Jesus Noe asked that the patent be con
firmed to him and it was so done. Where,
then, was the only legal title to the land?
It was in Jose Jesus Noe and all claim
ing under him.
.. "These plaintiffs claim under Guada
lupe Noe, and if : she bad any interest in
the land it was only a half interest. Jose
Noe applied for ; and received a patent for
the whole property to him. They never
applied for or received any patent to any
part of it.
"It may have been these plaintiffs had
an interest ?in the land, but if so 'it was
simply a cestui-que trust, which they had
a right to have operated within a limited
time. " '.'.-," ?:."..-
"It would : make no difference bow the
relation between the parties in this regard
arose." He then citedjthe case of Wilson
vs. Castro, to show that : tbe * trust created
in the manner suggested was a construe-
tive trust, 'against which the statute of
limitations would run. *
"Supposing we take ourselves," he said,
"back -; to the ;â  time when ' California . was
under Mexican rule. Then, I:. say, this
property was. separate property. I say so,
not because , I nave delved learnedly into
Mexican law as the gentleman on the
opposite side apparently attempted to do,
but because the Supreme " Court in early
days has decided that question. An early
case was then cited, which declared that
the husband, both during the life * of the
wife and after her death, had full dominion
of the ' community v , property ; and , could
freely dispose of it. . .y '
." "I "don't know what the Mexican law is,"
he continued. "I am not learned enough
in the civil law to go into those questions.
1 get my law from the decisions of the Su
preme Court of Â» this State, and I don't be
lieve any one can go behind it." : â .
"The Supreme Court has â  several times
gone behind itself," remarked Splivalvo. y
"True," said i Judge McKinstry, ; '.'but
that is a different matter. When it
changes it is time enough for us to change.
Until then we must take its law."
â¢ V "The J question 5 is,"-- concluded McKin
stry, "whether when , the law said he had
a full, free, overflowing power to sell this
estate, his heirs can come in and say to in
nocent purchasers for value, 'He misap
propriated the proceeds jof that sale. "-, He
did not apply -, the ' value received to the
settling of >.- the ; estate and ; satisfying the
claims of the wife's â¢: heirs.' Even if . they
could, there is not one iota of evidence be
fore this court that he did not apply the
proceeds to the settling of the estate." --'~v.
yy Franklin K. Lane, who represents the
greatest number of defendants in this suit
and, was to make the principal argument,
then addressed the court.: -:
: "As your Honor has sat here during the
last two days," said,' "I have no | doubt
the question has frequently risen in 'â¢ your
mind ;; Why was this suit brought? That
question has occurredl to J me, and I have
found two answers to it. One of these an
swers â¢* should y lead 'â '. all y, parties * connected
with the origin of this case to the State's
prison; the other should lead them to the
Home for the Feeble Minded. Either this
case is the result of a plan to levy, tribute
on the defendants, or it is the result of an
inability to understand 'the ;'; simple lan
guage ?of j our Supreme Court, which in a
long series of | decisions settled every ques
tion here involved over thirty years ago.
: Either this case . is â '. the i result of confeder
ated villiany or of hopeless idiocy. Either
there is matter here for the investigation
of a Grand Jury, or of a body of experts on
mental disease. . ... ,
: am temperatel in my 'statement be
cause I allow an alternative; there are
some 'in 'â â '- tbis courtroom who have been
brought here to protect property they have
held tin quiet :; possession for forty years
who would not be so generous." y,y :YY \
. The speaker then referred to the ridicu
lousness of the claims made by the plain
tiffs and referred to the argument of .their
counsel as a "mass of irrelevancy and ab
surdity;' ."'-,Â».â  -"**â¢.. r â  :
"Briefly stated,", he continued, "our case
is this : First, that the grant to Noe vested
in him a separate -; estate. Secondly, that
if the estate were in fact Â£ community, the
husband had, in the absence of a showing
of fraud, the absolute right of distribution.
Third, the plaintiffs are precluded by the
patent from making any ' claim to the
property. .
y Mr. Lane then briefly reviewed the main
facts which occurred in the accession to
the United States of the present State of
California. He explained the act of 1857
creating a Board of Land Commissioners.
"it was the duty of this board," he said,
"to ascertain ana settle the titles claimed
under Mexican or Spanish grant, and all
those claiming ;â  or ; to claim under â  such
grants were required by this act of Con
gress to present their claims "within the
time mentioned in this act.
< "In the case at bar not only have the
plaintiffs failed to show a compliance with
this act in their own behalf, but they have
themselves shown that the* original Senor
Noe did comply with said act and did ob
tain a confirmation â¢': of , his \ grant y and a
patent from the United. States.
y "The defendants here have obtained this
latter title, which is perfect. So that
plaintiffs have by their own showing
proved that they have no title whatever.
This of itself is sufficient to dispose of the
case. 'â .-*â¢ '.â¢:,
"But," said Mr. Lane, "ignoring for the
time being these facts, and assuming with
the plaintiffs that the property in ques
tion was the property of the matrimonial
partnership, still it has been shown that
Sen or Noe conveyed the property for a
valuable consideration, and our State Su
preme Court has repeatedly held that
even Under the Mexican law the husband
had such right and power of disposition,
and that the only limitation on such right
was in case of attempted transfer in fraud
of j the wife or her , heirs. .The very first
report of our Supreme Court, records lays
this principle down plainly and squarely, .
and subsequent cases followed tbe same
line." - ' V: â :?:â  y
Mr. Lane then read a number of esses in
the early reports establishing this theory.
"This," he said again, "was sufficient in
itself to dispose of the plaintiffs' claim." '
The attorney then read from the case of
Scott against Ward, in which the facts are
similar to those in this case. It was there
held plainly, emphatically and conclusive
ly, he said, that such property was the
separate property of the donee named in
the grant, and that neither the wife nor
her heirs took any interest in it whatso
ever. :
A number of other California cases were
cited as directly in point and conclusive
upon this question. V:
Continuing, he said: "It having been
shown that the property involved in this
litigation was the separate property of the
original Noe, it follows that neither the
wife nor any of her heirs, who are even
these plaintiffs, obtained any interest in
it; and the plaintiffs, being thus shown
to have acquired no title whatever, they
have no title to quiet, and their suit must
fail."
Mr. Lane concluded his argument with
an appeal for a speedy verdict, which,
he said, would bring joy to a thousand
homes where there was now fear and dis
couragement.
Mr. Van Duzer begged the indulgence of
the court, which was granted reluctantly,
to present an authority upon the point
that a Governor or chief man of a State
could not donate land other than as a
gift. If it assumed the character of a pur
chase it was void. * ,
His Honor then statÂ«d!that the attorneys
for the defendants would have ten days to
file briefs if they wished to make any sup
plemental argument, and the plaintiff
would have thirty days to file his replies.
This will take up to near the close of vaca
tion, when the court will immediately take
up the case, with a ; view to rendering an
early decision. Attorneys Mullaney, Stiad
burne and McKinne stated that they were
so well satisfied with the argument they
would submit no briefs.
ASSESSOR SIEBE WINS.
Judge Campbell Dismisses the
Charge of Perjury Against
Him.
District Attorney Barnes Makes the
Motion and Files Judge Wallace's
Decision.
As was to be expected after the decision
of Judge Wallace, the case of Assessor
John D. Siebe,. charged with perjury on
complaint of J. W. Darragh, was dis
missed by Judge Campbell yesterday af
ternoon. y Yy^y:'Y:-:-YYY;YY^Y
When the case was called District At
torney Barnes rose and said although 'he
had not the same right in a Police Court
as he had in the Superior Court to move
for the dismissal of a case, still he thought
in the circumstances he was justified in
doing so in this case. A similar . charge
against the Assessor had been pending be
fore Judge Wallace, and in moving lor its
dismissal, on the ground that the Assessor
was a quasi-judicial officer, he had cited
numerous English and , American author
ities in support of his contention. Judge
Wallace had; on Wednesday, ; rendered * a
lengthy decision dismissing the case, and
he submitted a copy of that decision as
his brief in the case. He therefore moved
for a dismissal. â¢ '-/'â '.
Attorney Baggett, . for the prosecution,
was not present, but the District Attorney
said he had seen Baggett and had in
formed him of the motion he was to
make. -'w.^ .â â :â .â â â ; ;\-- -r
Judge Campbell said that while recog
nizing the value of any decision by Judge
Wallace he was not bound, as a commit
ting magistrate, to follow it. He never
would approve of an official being charged
with perjury/unless- there were substan
tial grounds ' for > making it, and on the
same principle he had; no sympathy with
any one ' who \ would bring such a charge
from :! spite Jor petty spleen. . He thought
Andy Clunie and Attorney Baggett should
have more thoroughly examined into the
merits of the case before bringing it into
courtly He would order the dismissal of
the case on motion of the District At
torney.

IN SCHOOL LIFE.
Typical Incidents Marking
the Close of the
Term.
TEACHERS AND PUPILS.
Singular Mingling of Anxiety,
Pride, Ambition and
Pathos.
THE JOY OF THE HONORABIES
badness of Students Not Promoted.
Closing Exercises and Lists of
Graduates.
It is an eventful era to-day in school lifeâ
the last day of the term, a day prolific of
characteristic episodes in the year's ex
periences of teachers and pupils* in which
there is a curious emotional mingling of
anxiety, pride, ambition and pathos. Not
all of the boys and girls of the graduating
classes could win medals or have their
names placed on the roll of honor, so
naturally they were not so proud and
elated as their more favored schoolmates.
Still the ephemeral disappointments and
heart-burnings resulting from these causes
were generally forgotten in the joy. and
excitement attending the closing exercises.
The advent of the six weeks' season of rest
and recreation will be welcomed by all of
the teachers and pupils in the primary,
grammar and high , schools, and at the
opening of the next term, in August, all
resentments and jealousies will have dis
appeared and everything will run on
smoothly for another year.
A severe strain is put upon the nerves
of principals on the last day of the term.
Parents come to them to learn if their
children are to be promoted, and teachers
petition for a change of grade and for
leave to remove io more desirable class
rooms, and dissatisfied pupils beg for
transfers to other schools. It is Impossi
ble, as all teachers know, to get the chil
dren to give any attention to lessons on
the last day of the term, and the most
that is attempted is to maintain some
semblance of discipline. The honorary
pupils- who are dismissed a day or two
earlier, generally come back to school on
the last day of the term and stay until all
is over. Their proud and: smiling faces
are in striking contrast to those of their
classmates, who, although not necessarily
through any fault of theirs, have failed of
promotion and miss the laurels worn so
triumphantly by the lucky honoraries.

An exhibit of the work done by the boys
in the manual training department at
tracted general attention, and was the sub
ject of approving comment. A large room
in the basement is used as a mechanical
workshop, and is fully equipped with all
of the requisite tools, benches, etc
11. E. Eidridge, the instructor of this de
partment, also teaches the first principles
of median drawing and its relation to
the finished work. A variety of useful
articles is comprised in the exhibitâ such
as boxes, book racks, towel rollers,
brackets, easels, step-ladders, etc. These
are unmistakable proofs of the progress of
the students during the last year. It is
not intended to make carpenters of the
boys, but by training the hand and the

Polk Street Last
Night.
â¢The McKinley Club of the Forty-first
â¢ The McKinley Club of tho Forty-first
District held a ratification meeting in its
hall, at the corner of Pacific and Polk
streets, last night.
H. C. Firebaugh officiated as president
and D. M. Jacott as secretary. The fol
lowing resolution was adopted by unani
mous vote:
Resolved. By the McKinley Club, that It
heartily indorses the platform and principles
this day promulgated by the National Republi
can Convention at St. Loui".
Resolved, Further, that this club congratu
lates the American people upon the
nomination of William McKinley of Ohio
for President of these United States, and
presages his triumphant election to that
high office in November next. That we Wel
come the prospect of a return to Republican
rule, which is synonymous with the opening
of our factories and. mines and a renewal of
prosperity which departed from us when the
Democratic party obtained control. .
Resolved, further, That these resolutions be
forwarded by the secretary of this club to the
Hon. William McKinley, the next President of j
the United (states of America, at his residence,
Canton, Ohio. H. c. Firebaugh. President.
D. M. JacotT, Secretary.
Messrs. Pogue, Gundlach and Jacott
were appointed a committee to arrange for
the Young Men's Club joining. with the
McKinley Cluo in the ratification meetlnc
to be held Saturday night. Some time ago
a number of the younger members of the
club withdrew and founded what they
called tbe Young Men's Club. It was more
a matter of convenience than disaffection,
as those forming the new organization
lived quite a distance from the meeting
place of the original McKinley Club. . But
now harmony prevails and both clubs will
participate as a whole in the ratification
Saturday nizht.^B^BmRPBBBSBI^i
The club of the Forty-first was the orig

Billets to the
Blonde.
DID NOT WOO FOR HIMSELF.
At That Time, as at Present, It Was
a Purely Bus:n3ss Matter
With Him.
y Yesterday's testimony in the Ashley
trial, like much that has preceded it, was
of an unpublishable character and con
sisted chiefly of facts brought out in, the
testimony of Detective Wood.
O'Kefe has not the expertness which
thirty-five years' experience on the wit
ness stand has given Detective Wood, and
in his cross-examination yesterday he
DETECTIVE DANIEL J. . O'KEFE.
contradicted many of his previous state
ments. When questioned about â¢ his rela
tions with Miss Ashley he denied that he
acted toward her in any other than a busi
ness capacity. When, as Mr.: Balch's
agent, he brought flowers, candy and bil
lets-doux to Miss Ashley, he was not on fa
miliar terms with her. As to ever having
made love to her, why, that was preposter
ous.
O'Kefe occupied the stand during the
morning session of the court. His story
was substantially the same as his employ
er's. He admitted that he had received a
consideration, $3 a day, for his services.
He testified that be had taken flowers and
candy to Miss Ashley from Mr. Balch, but
couldn't remember how often he had
done so. On one occasion O'Kefe stated
Miss Ashley had told him, with much
weeping, that she had been intimate with
a commercial traveler who had caused her
trouble.
At the opening of the afternoon session
O'Kefe was again put on the stand. The
witness was lurther questioned about his
testimony on the direct examination con
cerning Miss Ashley's escapade with the
traveler.
The witness had an interview with Miss
Ashley in a house in Boston. He didn't
remember that Miss j Ashley was doing
anything at the time, but when Mr. Crit
tenden asked the witness if * Miss Ashley
was not laughing and singing at the time,
Mr. O'Kefe recollected that she was crying,
sobbing. He didn't remember whether he
gave her any candy or flowers. He didn't
remember whether he gave her, money or
whether she took money from a letter
which he gave her.
* During his interview with Miss Ashley
the witness had watched â  her very closely,
though he had no particular purpose in
doing so. Miss .Ashley,, alter she, had
read the letter from Mr. Balch, was weep
ing, evidently from something she bad
read. yTÃFfflnfllTOllfflff^
The witness was also present at an in
terview between: Miss Ashley and Mr.
Balch. At this interview Mr. Balch had
declared tbat Miss ; Ashley should see a
doctor, and the name of . Dr. Whitmore
was suggested. '
Later Miss Ashley lived with a Mrs.
Follett. O'Kefe had * . seen her . several
times while she lived there, but his rela
tions with her were of a, purely business
character. yy He Was not on familiar terms
with her, never made love to her, never
had ; conversations with 'â¢ her about love,
philosophy or history. He met her in the
parlor, as the lady of â  the house did not
wish Miss Ashley to receive him in her
room. o?Kefe also * had interviews ,' with
her .at various other ] houses where she
stopped.
In regard . to â¢' Miss Ashley's stay at the
Burton City Hospital," O'Kefe admitted
that he had never seen ber there, but that
he had taken letters . there addressed to
Miss Ashley, and had taken away letters
written by her. x *
y*Aty this point Judge Slack adjourned
court until Saturday morning at 10 o'clock.
Mr. Crittenden was anxious for a longer
postponement that he might have time to
i get certain affidavits :: from the East which
he bad not yet been able to get on account
of pressure of business. Judge Slack, how
ever, was obdurate, so the cross-ex inclina

Sick and Sore in Body and Even Worse

In last December, John Baptista, a deck
hand on the steamer San Joaquin. 4, was
the victim of an accident from the effects
of which he has not yet recovered.
A cylinder burst and injured his head,
and now he complains that consequence
of the recommendation of Dr. Resan the
company will no longer give him any
financial aid and that for the last two
months he and his wife and children have
been dependent upon public charity for
their support. : *
His head is still sore and he is confined
in his bed and unable to work, but at the
alleged injustice of the steamship com
pany his heart is even sorer.

REGATTA IDEA ABANDONED.
It Is Probable There Will Be a Mili
tary Display Under General
Warfield.
Progress toward a memorable celebra
ion of the Fourth is fast being made and
affairs are shaping themselves in a very
desirable fashion. Meetings of several
committees were held yesterday afternoon
and evening in the Mills building and
very encouraging reports were banded in.
In the afternoon the invitation and re
ception committee met. Mrs. Vidaver of
the special committee reported that the
San Francisco Fruit and Flower Mission
would send fifty children, the Little Sis
ters' Infant Shelter 30, the Girls' Directory
60, the Newsboys* Home 100, the Lick Or
phan Asylum 125, and the Good Templars
Orphanage of -Vallejo 125, which, in addi
tion to the ; 150 already reported, makes
about 650, with a few yet to hear from.
The special committee on park amuse
ments for tbe children reported that they
would have to pay $150 for the use of the
merry-go-round for the day. For some
reason or other they absolutely refused to
permit the use of the donkeys and goats.
The manager of the children's play
ground has promised to furnish 3009 sand
wiches for $300, these including milk and
popcorn.
It was decided to issue 5000 invitation
cards and tickets for the literary exercises.
Mrs. Vidaver, Mrs. Richter and Miss
Keith were appointed a committee to se
lect from the lady members solicitors best
suited to visit the various hotels and res
taurants for contributions of sandwiches
and knick-knacks for the children.
It was also decided to present each child
with a souvenir flag and Mrs. J. Murray
Bailey Was appointed a special committee
to ascertain the cost of such flags and the
places where they could be purchased.
v About a dozen members of La Estrella
Parlor ' No. 89, Native Daughters of the
Golden West, signified their willingness
to assist the committee in taking care of
the children or any other work to be done.
In the evening the executive committee
met. George W. Elder of the recatta com
mittee reported that it would be impos
sible to collect any money on the City
front for the regatta, and therefore moved
that the idea be abandoned and the com
mittee disbanded. The motion was car
ried. -.'--" ' -v.- â â  y â  . â  :..'â â :. ,
I The finance committee reported having
about $2000, withdrawn the paid collec
tors and appointed volunteers to finish the
work. The names of these volunteers are
as follows: .

tions (steamship)â Major W. B. Hooper; light,

The chairman was notified to request
the chairman of each committee to send in
an Itemized statement of the amount re
quired to make bis part of the celebration
a success, and to have this report ready by
Monday night.
T. ecbairman of the decoration commit
tee thought if this committee Would grant
about $800 they could collect the balance
to carry out their plans.
The parade committee requested the
privilege of withdrawing tho appropria
tion granted for the Continental army, be
lieving they could make a better display
by expending the money in some other
manner. Tbey were accorded the privi
lege of reconsidering trie matter. They
also reported tbat Genera^ Warfield would
call out the militia of this City at an ex
pense of abouusi7o.
, Mr, Giiisonof the auditing committee
asked time until next Monday night in
which to furnish a complete report.
The funds now on hand were given as
amounting to $5000, with the City appro
priation, and about $2000 more in prospect.
To â '. maintain the much higher level *of

THE WOOL TRADE.
An official statement gives the wool imports
Into the United States for April at 12,050.954
pounds, against 30,083.599 pounds for the same
month last year. One reason for the marked fall
ing off in these imports for the two months is the
fact 1 hat the wool Is worth relatively more in the
foreign markets than lv this country, owing to the
glut of foreign wool in the United Stat! s. The
imports of foreign wool in the United States for
tbe fir^t ten months of the fiscal year ending
April 30. 1896, were 211,969,661 pounds against
166,643,907 pounds for the same time in the pre
vious fiscal year, The imports of manufactured
wool were $2,194,778 for April and $49,682,778
for the ten months, against $31,499,362 in 1894 95.
Explanation.
The arrow files with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the i
â¢ays; those underneath it. if any, the amount of I
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; Iso-
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in theinterlot
and low along the coast, and â  the isot-ars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "l-w" is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb-
able. With a "high" in he vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
Weather in winter, The reverse of these conditions
- â¢ill produce an opposite result-

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V.. June 18.-The stock mar
ket to-day - was feverish and in the main firm.
London ' sold " fairly large amounts of St. 5 Paul,
louisvlile and Nashville, Atchison and - other
Issues, probably 15,100. shares In all, and this
started the downward movement Th' attitude of
the foreigners was a disappointment and was at
tributed to the reports of an unfavorable turn in
Venezuelan matters and to a misunderstanding of
certain pianks In the Republican uiatform touch-
ing on foreign affairs. The views of the veteran
bear operator now In London were cabled to this
Kid*- and given wide circulation, and encouraged
his somewhat limited fol owing to fresh endeavors
on the short side of the account. As a matter of
fact, however, the liquidations for London were
the main factor at work
It .may develop later that Cam mack's message
and the selling by London bouses served a com
mon purpose, namely io enable certain interests
opposed to McKinley to counteract the effect or
his nomination on a gold platform. The London
selling and the efforts Of the bears did not unsettle
confidence and the selling of long stock was of
limited proportions. Holders of securities were
encouraged by the decisive vote at St. Louis for
the gold plank, and commission . houses were
buyers of the standard issues at the decline. ."
The wrangle over silver at the St. Louis conven
tion was used against the market by the traders,
and in . the closing hour of business prices sold at
the lowest point or lhe day. The decline range.l
from i/i to li/2 percent in the usually active list.
Quicksilver was more active an 1 sold at 2 for
the common stock. The preferred opened at 11

COFFEEâ C. E. Bickford'scircularsays: "There
is very little to be said of this market during the
past ten days. Business has been extremely slow,
at times seeming to stop altogether. Small sales
have been made here and there' at slight conces
sions, generally under pressure to sell on tbe part
of Importers or in the effort to close out remnants.
Tbe larger holders, however, have not seen fit to
accept the prices [ thus made as a basis for new
values, and In a gener .1 way the market has not
undergone any material change. To-day's first
band stock consists of 281 : Costa Bica, 3:-,4 Nica

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
-y --Y 908 Broadway, June 18. J
The Good Government Association of
Oakland has commenced its campaign in
favor of a low tax levy for the next fiscal
year. As the Council must fix the levy at
the first meeting in July the matter is en-
Raging the attention of every taxpayer.
The Good Government Association
came into existence last year, and as a re
sult of its work the tax levy was not per
mitted to exceed the dollar, which is the
limit allowed by the charter. The Coun
cil wanted it fixed at" $1 22, but the Mayor j
vetoed everything but the dollar levy, and
it finally prevailed.
The Good Government Association does
not hold open meetings, and little of its
inner workings are made known to the
public. It is supposed to be paying the
â¢salary of Expert Kaufman, who, with the
sanction of the Mayor, keeps account of
every fund in the city government. The
campaign of the association consists or
compiling and issuing facts connected
â with the city government, so that voters
may know just what is being done.
W. E. Bullock, solicitor of the associa
tion, says that on tbe list of signers are
hundreds of names representing at least
one-half of the wealth of the city. "No
man," he said, "who does not pay at least
$100 in taxes has been asked to sign the
petition, because it may cost something to
win this fight, and only those who can
afford to stand the. expense have been
asked to stand in and help make the
fight."
A leader of the movement, and a man
who is one of the six most wealthy men
of Oakland, said this af ternoan : "The pur
pose for which we are working is not, as
t ..e cry goes ud, to avoid paying our just
taxes, out our great desire is to avoid
providing a levy that will produce an in
come large enough to allow politicians to
carry out a lot of expensive and foolish
schemes for self-glorification. Everybody
knows that these are hard times, and that :
it is not a period when there is a necessity !
.for a large tax levy.
"The. municipal affairs are conducted on !
a basis altogether too primitive. The \
Council meetings are never held during \
business hours, but are held at all hours '
np to midnlght,iand when a man of .prop- ,
erty ***vants to see a Councilman he never \
knows where to find him. They have
DO office and no office hours, and the man- i
ncr in which things are done is suggestive
of a little village. There are far too many- |
offices in the city government and j
far .too many conflicts. There are |
some men in the city and county gov- j
ernments who are preventing people i
from coming here and investing their j
money. Our association has been charged j
â¢with. hurting the town and with attempt- j
ing to coerce officials. The thing is foolish i
on its face. We have our fortunes in- ;
vested and we are far more anxious for the j
permanent progress and prosperity of the i
town than the calamity howlers who have j
nothing to lose, but who hope to gain |
something. y'.yyy' .. . V,
"What is really needed is a modern
charter. Five Councilmen who shall be
paid enough to make it worth their while j
to attend to business, is sufficient to look ,
after this city. They should hold their j
â¢meetings during business hours, like the j
Supervisors of San Francisco, who meet in j
the afternoon. The purpose of the Good \
Government Association is to adjust these
matters, but at present our main effort is
in regard to the tax levy."
A NEW AMBULANCE.
Fabiola Hospital Receives the Gift of
a Public-Spirited Citizen of
Oakland. _
OAKLAND, Cal., June 18.â new
ambulance of the Fabiola Hospital was
first Been on the streets this evening. It
is the gift of a wealthy public-spirited citi
zen who up to this time has refused to let
bis name be known to the public
The ambulance is a pretty affair. It is
covered, but has windows on each side
and doors and steps at the rear for an en
trance. The interior is fitted up elabor
ately for the convenience of physicians
and care of patients. There is everything
that could be heeded in any emergency
and suitable arrangements for moving in
jured or sick people with the least , possi
ble shock to their systems.
Heretofore the wounded of - this city
have had to be cared for in the patrol
wagon, but in the future, under suitable t
regulations, they will have the use of this
new ambulance.
FRANCHISE RELEASE.
The Council First Wants to Know the
Effect on the Guarantee
Clause.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 18.â Secretary
A. L. Stone appeared before the street
raiiroad committee of the City Council last
evening - and . requested it to permit the
Haywards electric road to abandon that
part of its franchise covering Clay street,
from Thirteenth to Eighth, and Eighth
street, "from Clay ,to Franklin. He said
that the company did not desire to hold
the streets in question, as it had _ been
found that they were not necessary to ac
commodate patrons of the road. .
â¢ The committee decided to take no action
until the City Attorney had advised it as
to whether, If: the Council granted the
company's request; for the abandonment
of that much of the franchise, it would
affect in any way the provision of the
franchise requiring " the company to pay
to the city one-fourth of J- per cent of . its
gross earnings after a certain number of
years. y-^-taSB-flfMB-SSSI

FUNDS ARE LOW.
Close Figuring Necessray to Prevent a
Deficit Occurring. ,' '
OAKLAND, Cal., June 18.â The general
fund of the city is now exhausted and the
police fund has not more than enough to
pay seven of the fifty police^ officers their
June salaries. The sewer fund is also de
pleted. BBBpJ
The balances in the various funds at
present are as follows: Salary $2652 85, fire
$6352 80. police $740 79, - â  Btreet $3918 85,
â¢sewer $40 15. park $710 07, fiie and police
telephone $4015 66, High School $712 47,
school $15,563 92, Free Library $Bis 98 and
street light $372 22.
There is in the police relief and pension
fund at present $7929 36. On July 1 the
city will have to pay $20,000 toward the re
demption, of the school-building bonds
and also about $10,000 interest. There is
in the former fund but $17,987 52, requir

THREE LONG HOURS.
Will Chambers and Mrs. Halpruner
Capsized in the Kstu-
ary.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 18.â Will Cham
bers and Mrs. Dr. Halpruner had an expe
rience the other day that neither will
forget for some time to come. They were
out on the estuary in a skiff, which cap
sized. They both managed to hold on to
the overturned skiff, and for three long
hours they clung for their lives.
Chambers secured an oar, tied his hand
kerchief to it and held it aloft until a man
on shore saw it and came to their rescue.

BERKELEY'S NEW SCHOOL
The Proposed Building Will Not
Be Finished for Next
August
Board of Education Expects to Have
the Schools Built for the
Second Term.
Second Term.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 18.â new
school buildings that are to be erected in
Berkeley, as provided for in the recent
special election, will not be ready for the
opening of the next school year. . y
The special election gives to the Board
of Education the sum of $22,500 to spend
for new school buildings, the money to
be raised by direct taxation. Though the
tax levy will not be in for some months
yet, it was thought that the Board of Edu
cation might let contracts for the build
ings to be erected at once, the payment
for them to be made when the tax money
was collected.
Under tbis arrangement it was thought
that the new buildings might be ready for
occupancy by the opening of the next
school year, but the idea of having them
ready by that time has been abandoned,
and the best that is hoped for is that the
increased accommodations for school
children will be available by the begin
ning of the second term of the coming
school year. . '.
A special meeting oi the Board of Edu
cation will be held to-morrow night, when'
bids will be received for the construction
of an addition to the Lorin school by
means of which it is hoped .that much of
the congestion that has hampered the
work of . teachers in the past may be cor
rected.
The addition to the school of the South
End will consist of two rooms, and will be
built at once.
Berkeley Gym's Difficulties.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 18.â The finan
cial difficulties of George Bates of the
Berkeley Gymnasium promise to result in
the closing of the oldest private educa
tional institution in Berkeley. The "Ber
keley Gym," as it is popularly called, was
established in 1877 and has been in charge
of Professor Bates since 1882.
Since its establishment the school has
turned out a large number of graduates,
many of whom have entered the State
University. j It has attracted students from
all over the coast, many of its pupils being
from Central American countries.
No decision has yet been arrived at as
to what will be the future of the school,
but it is understood that negotiations are
on foot whereby the school may remain
open.
Newspaper Publishers Incorporate.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 18.â The Ga
zette Publishing Company, publisher of
the West Berkeley Bail}' Gazette, has in

Among those who anxiously awaited
Valentine Alviso, an Old Livermore Valley Republican Who Carried a Campaign
.: Banner in Alameda. County During War Times and Who Is Still an Active
â  Campaigner. /'â '"* "' ""; ; â¢'-. '" 'â " "'â â ' .[. "' â '' ""â 
' news from the Republican National Con
j vention > to-day, none were more enthu
; siastic than the historic Republican of
i Livermore Valley, Valentine Alviso.
From his early boyhood Valentine Alviso
I has been a dyed-in-the-wool Republican,
; and he is one of the most ardent supporters
jof party theories in . the valley.
!He was - the â¢-. lifelong : friend of the
I late Senator Stanford. During the cam
] paign, in war times in which Stanford
! was elected Govornor he learned to ad
| mire the plucky young Spaniard who went
i to the front of every Republican proces
; sion, carrying the stars and stripes. ' Those
i were exciting days, and friendships then
| made were not easily dissolved. Years
1 afterward Senator Stanford met Mr. Al
| viso. : He quickly and warmly grasped his
j hands, and showed the keenest pleasure in
talking over old times.
Valentine Alviso was later appointed to
J a responsible position in the United States
Mint, and it was through the influence of
Senator Stanford. He gave up that trust
to accept a more importani duty. It was
that of keeper of Spanish archives in the
Surveyor-General's office. Democratic as
cendency resulted in abolishing this office.
Aside from these positions Mr. Alviso has
served Washington Township as a County
Supervisor and has also been in tbe Legis
lature. .
But wherever he was, Valentine Alviso
has always been a stalwart Republican.
Although more than a generation has
passed since he carried the banner in a
Republican procession, he is still active,
ana Livermore Valley will never want for
an exponent of Republicanism so long as
Valentine Alviso lives. ;
To this day Mr. Alviso takes pleasure in
recalling his first greeting from Mr. Stan
ford, at the time the railroad man was on
a tour of inspection, just after the road
had been built into the valley. It was
springtime, and if there is , an Eden in
Alameda County it is in Livermore Valley
in springtime. V Mr. Stanford was; en
raptured, with the view, and "exclaimed: J
"I have traveled over,' Europe and haye â 
looked upon the far-famed | scenery of this
and the; old continent, but I never beheld:
a more beautiful place than this." 'â¢.".
Before the discovery of :; gold the Alviso
family was prominent /publicly and : so
cially. Valentine's grandfather arrived at
Monterey in 1776 as an officer of the Span
ish army, and 'Valentine was born at the
Mission Dolores." Y.'-.:'.'"^'-:---:-"-- 'â '
The old Republican married the daughter
of Robert Livermore, a pioneer of 1822, and
the two families thus united are the oldest
in the county. '.'â ".:
Valentine Alviso will be invited to at
tend the : ratification meeting in Oakland
Saturday night.

ALAMEDA, Cal., June 18.â As soon as

preparations for : holding a ratification
meeting this evening.
- A large crowd of veterans, regulars and

ALAMEDA, Cal., June 18.â N.
Delanoy, who has acquired considerable
notoriety in connection with his endeavors
to erect an electric light plant in this city,
has instituted V proceedings for divorce
from his wife. Cruelty is ' stated as the
cause of the . action. He alleges that his
wife threatened to have him charged with
arson unless he gave up his interest in the
estate of his dead boy to her; also that she
conspired with her -. daughter to defraud
him of $1600, struck him on the arm and
called him vile names, y
Mrs. Delanoy, who has been an; invalid
for * many : months, will file a i cross-com
plaint and ask for a divorce and, alimony
on the ground of extreme cruelty.
Bhe says she will endeavor to prove the
charge of arson ; and alleges that; several
years ago he left her without means and
she "was obliged to obtain- a divorce.
Shortly afterward she and I her | family in
herited $18,000 from a relative in the East.
Delanoy. heard of it and went \ back to her,
made his peace and they were : remarried.
Tbe Commodore Was Hot.
V* ALAMEDA, June 18.â rumors
were current to-day in the papers about
prominent people. One was that President
Forderer of the City Trustees intended re
signing. Tne other was that Commodore
Leonard of the Encinai Yacht Club would
sever \ his connection with his old-time
favorite. y y
â Y>. In V neither >is there any truth. The
former is said to have arisen from the fact
that Mr. Forderer has severed his connec
. tion with < the. t Forderer i Cornice Works,
Mission street, San Francisco.*
; â  With recard to Leonard, it appears that
the â¢' commodore was ' not â , in y the - best of
humor with; some of the yachtsmen *;fcr '
ignoring his directions when J sailing, and,
intimated in plain language that his orders
would have to be attended to or a new
commodore would be a necessity. ;
There is no- disposition among any of our
people to promote prohibitory or -retaliatory
legislation. Our policies are adopted not to
the hurt of others, but to secure to ourselves
the advantages that fairly grow out of our fa
vored position as a Nation. Our form of gov

WORK BEGINS ON
THE EXPOSITION.
Gardens to Be Laid Out
Inside the Big
Inclosure.
MANY NEW FEATURES.
Every Town in the County Will
Be Invited to Send
â¢ Exhibits.
MEECHANTS AEE IN UNISON.
After the Exposition a Permanent
Exhibit Will Be Opened by the
Board of Trade.
Oakland Office, San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 18. J
Work on the county exposition to be
held in August commenced to-day. Un
like last year, the whole of . the block on
which the exposition buildings stand will
be fenced in and will be made attractive.
The grounds will be laid out with taste
and will be one of the features of the show.
Last year the exposition was originated
and opened within thirty days and was,
naturally, a very crude though very suc
cessful one. It was held at Christmas and
was in the nature of a midwinter 'show,
and it was, therefore, impossible for there
to be any fruit or floral display. By hold
ing it in August there will be no limit to
the supply of flowers and some noteworthy
displays have been promised.
Work was begun to-day on the big fence
that will inclose the plot. " Plows . have
have also . been put to work to break up
the soil, and the gardens will be planted
at once. There will be little Japanese tea
houses and .:. out-of-door displays, .and
many attractions that were not thought
of, or not possible, last December. ,
Craigie Sharp, the superintendent of the
exposition, is now touring the interior of
the. county in the interest of the affair.
Every town will be visited and will be
asked to make a display. Livermore has
fallen in line, and the League of Progress
will see that the eastern end of the valley
upholds its reputation. : San Leandro
has a Board of Trade, and several other
towns have local organizations, all of
which will undoubtedly respond. ,; .
In connection with the exposition is the
permanent exhibit of the Oakland Board'
of Trade, which will be opened after the
exposition in the large hall in the Hall of
Records, which is at pre sent vacant. Many
of the exhibits will be transferred to the
permanent exhibition room and will be
kept in order for the purpose of establish
ing a place where visitors can see the
products and manufacturing development
of the county to advantage. The interior
towns will also have ' exhibits there and
the whole affair will be under the direc
tion of Craigie Sharp, who is also secre
tary ol the Board of Trade.
Now that the Merchants' Exchange and
the Board of Trade have signified their in
tention to work hand in hand with the ex
position, which is an .incorporated body,
there is no doubt tbat the show will, be an
elaborate and successful one. : The execu
tive committee is now busy laying its
plans and will soon announce its readiness
to receive applications for space.
In ; the manufacture of knives the di
vision of labor has been carried to such an
extent that one knife is handled by

MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION
Its Active Membership Is Now
Over the Five-Hundred
Mark.
The Organization Is Taking a Spir
ited Interest in All Public
Matters.
The regular meeting of the directors of
the Merchants' Association was held
yesterday, present President Dohrmann
and Directors A. S. Baldwin, Charles
Bundschu, W. G. Doane, William Doxey,
A. Fusenot, Hugo D. Keil, M. S. Kohl
berg, Henry Michaels, M. A. Rothchild,
Joseph Simonson and Frank A. Swain.
The vexatious garbage matter was taken
nr, and inasmuch as the courts have de
cided that neither of -tfie bids offered
could be legitimately accepted by the
City, the board of directors decided to
have a thorough investigation made of
the garbage question. The matter was ac
cordingly referrea to the engineer of the
association, Ernest McCullough, with in-
Bcructions to prepare a thorough report
upon the subject, to be reported to the
board of directors at its next meeting.
The committee upon public affairs re
ported progress in preparing its report
upon the important question of the new
tax levy. It has been arranged with the
Finance Committee qf the Board of Su*oer
visors that a conference will take place
next month upon this subject, and recom
mendations will be made by the commit
tee on public affairs looking to a reduc
tion of the tax levy for the ensuing fiscal
year.
ft was decided that a full representation
should be made at the meeting of the
Board of Election Commissioners next
Monday morning at 10 o'clock to urge
upon the board the importance and justice
of having the words "For the new charter"
and "Against the new charter" at the
head of the municipal portion of the ticket.
Communications were received from the
American, English and Australian Asso
ciations for the Advancement of Science, as
well as from the Christian Endeavor As
sociation, asking the encouragement and
support of the Merchants' Association in
visiting and holding their conventions
next year in the city of San Francisco.
The board decided to act favorably upon
the requests in both cases. The science
societies mentioned will hold their con
vention in Toronto, arid have made ar
rangements to visit Victoria and Van
couver at the end of the session. If they
can secure favorable rates to this City they
will, no doubt, continue their trip to San
Francisco and may in the future hold _
convention here.
Thy board decided to call the convention
to discuss the new charter on Wednesday,
August 5, in the Assembly Hall of the
Mills building. It is expected that all of
the improvement associations will be rep
resented and that the body will be of an
influential character.
In accordance with the request of the
Registrar a list of 2000 names will __*â¢ pre
pared of leading mercantile houses to
whom applications will be sent for clerks
of ' election. The board decided to co
operate in every way with the Election
Commissioners in securing competent and
reliable clerks of election on November 3.
The following fifty-nine members were
unanimously elected,, making a total mem
bership of 510 members :

CITIZENS PROTEST
AT THE DARKNESS.
They Say That Crime Lurks
in the Shadowy
Streets.
HURTS EVENING TRADE.
Merchants Hurl Old-Fashioned
Philippics at the City
Fathers.
IS A DISGRACE TO THE TOWN.
A Prominent Resident Chooses the
Center of California Street to
Reach Home.
Out of the darkness of the City's streets
there conies a voice â a voice that trembles
with indignant protest at the injurious
and original method the Supervisors have
taken to cut down the current expenses.
The tax-paying citizens of San Francisco
do not hesitate to express their views
on this Supervis oral stroke of politi
cal economy. Not one interviewed yester
day could think of anything favorable to
say regarding the action, but all scored
what they termed an unjust and wholly
unreasonable action in the roundest terms.
Many of the most prominent merchants
were interviewed yesterday, among whom
William Doxey, the bookman, said : "This
movement on the part of the Supervisors
I consider unreasonable and absurd. There
certainly must be some funds that are
available to pay for street lights. If I re
member rightly, there remains in the
treasury a fund that was to be expended
for street-sweeping, something like $30,000.
This money has never been used for that
purpose. I cannot see why it cannot be
drawn on to defray the expense of street
lighting.
"Dark streets," he said, "put a premium
on crime; robbers and burglars thrive al
ways in dark cities. Out near my home
at Ashbury Heights we are in complete
darkness. It is difficult to find a house,
even though you know it* locality on the
block. It is certainly a great disgrace to
our City. :â  -::-YY->
Andrew M. Davis of the Golden Rule
Bazaar said: "lean think of nothing the
Supervisors could do to be more prejudicial
to the best interests of thin City or that
would be attended with greater hazard
than the keeping of the City in darkness
for any given period. The only thing I
can think of that would be as serious as
doing this would be the withdrawal of the
Fire Department or the police force. It
would almost seem as advisable to close
up the courts for a given time on the plea
of economy.
"The dark streets increase the danger of
being robbed, especially in the residence
portion of the town. It is a sin. Taxpay
ers have a great deal to put up with, in
deed. '*
"The citizens of San Francisco," said
Mr. Foltz, manager of Kast's shoestore,
"have my most profound sympathy. Ido
not spend the night here, I am thankful
to say. I live in the well-lighted and per
petually lighted little town of Alameda."
A. Qnade, the grocer, said: "This at
tempt at economy on the part of our City
fathers reminds me of a certain fabulous
animal who snapped at a gnat and swal
lowed a camel; and I believe that the
municipal affairs should be carried on with
the same system as is a business house.
1 applaud this evidence on tbe Supervi
sors' part of a desire to be economical, but
it seems to me that it is being demon
strated rather too near the close of the
eleventh hour and in a way that interferes
most seriously with the smooth running
of City affairs.
"I hold it a disgrace to the City. lam
wholly opposed to it. There might be
other ways far more advisable than turn
ing out lights of a big city. What a repu
tation we establish when strangers come
here and are compelled to grope their way
along the streets."
; "To say the least," said Mr. Fredericks,
vice-president of the Will & Finck Com
pany, "the Western Addition looked yery
glum last night, and to tell you the truth,
1 did not consider my life safe on my way
home out California street. In fact, 1 am
not ashamed to say that I walked in the
middle of the street. Think 01 it; in a City
the size of San Francisco, with a tax-rate
as high as ours, that one is obliged to walk
out in the street for safety's Bake. I con
sider lighting the streets as good as oolice
protection. It would he all right on a
moonlight night, but without a moon
well, we are not in it. I think we should
have light anyhow ; let other things be cut
down, but not, as is figuratively done, the
lamp-posts."
George proprietor of the confec
tionery store under the Phelan building,
said: "1 paid over $2000 in taxes this
year, and now I have to go home in dark
ness. When you shut off the street lights
people are afraid to come out of doors,
hence those merchants who keep open
evenings lose ; money. I never have been
in such darkness in all my life as I was
while going down Larkin street to my
HEW TO-DAT.

home last night. It was like being in a
room. It is 'hardly the fair thing,
and we who pay taxes should not be made
to suffer in this way.
"It is an outrage to the City, an out
rage." said H. Roman, the clothier. "I
could hardly where my house was
when I went home at 11 o'clock last night.
The street lights should not be sacrificed
for the sake of a general economy. Other
funds should be drawn on. This injures
evening trade to a great extent. It gives
footpads and burglars all the opportunity
in the world to molest people. One can
not see ten steps ahead or behind on the
sidewalks. This two-and-a-quarter tax
rate has not done us any more good than
the previous rates. â 
Manager yon Rooschen of the Cafe
ZmKand said: "I certainly believe that
the taxpayers - should have light on the
streets every niglit in the year. It is not
only a shame to have the streets in dark
ness, but it is positively dangerous. It is
rather a poor policy in my estimation.
Dark streets keep people within doors."
"It is a highly commendable thing on
the part of the Supervisors to economize,"
said Mr. Hale of the dry-goods firm of
Hale Brothers, "but there are certain re
quirements which are absolute necessities
or. the welfare of a city. | Lighting the
streets is a good legitimate expense,
and it should be met. Statistics
show (that our municipal expenses
are increasing year by year, the
question now comes up, What do we get
in return for our money? .Light streets
are certainly as much . a preventive of
crime as the police force itself. I cannot
compare the Fire Department, the police
force and street lighting as being different
in the scale of importance; they rather
are functions of the City government that
go hand in hand. One is as valuable as
the other and all are absolutely necessary.
If economy is necessary let it be in the
other departments."
Thomas H. B. Varney said: "I really
have not enough words to express my dis
gust at such legislation. The idea of this
City being in complete darkness for one
night is, to my mind, an exceedingly
serious affair, but for fifteen nights the
idea is preposterous and disgraceful."
The merchants are not the only class of
citizens who find eloquence to hurl philip
pics at the Street Lights Committee of
the Board of Supervisors.
Dr. F. W. Harris said: "So. long as the
people will neglect their duty as citizens
so long will they be made to suffer from
the mismanagement of their servants.
Had the proper men been in power to care
for the requirements of the taxpayers
there would be light in our streets to
night and until the end of the fiscal year.
"Thousands of people who are assessed
their pro rata year after year in this Coun
ty to bear its expense are too easy going.
1 hey take it for granted that honest peo
ple and proper business managers will
reach power. So they stay home when
they should be present at primaries
selecting the best men to represent
them in the conducting of the
City's affairs. But no, they stay
away, claiming that either domestic,
social, fraternal or other business en
grosses their attention too much for them
to spare a few minutes to a subject which
is as vital as choosing City Fathers. As a
plain business proposition, is it not rea
sonable that a sane man would devote a
little while to choosing an employe to
manage his business affairs?
"That is what our Supervisors do for us.
They simply attend to our wants and pay
out bur money for the gratification of our
desires.
"If we are obliged to grope our way
through our streets at night, because of a
lack of gas or electric light, it is that our
chosen servants were ill-chosen, and they
would have been better chosen had we, all
of us, taken more interest in the prelimi
naries incidental to obtaining a municipal
government. We deserve to get what we
are getting, and I hope the lesson will im
prove us in our methods."
Dr. Thomas Morffew, member* of the
State Dental Association, said : "lam at
a loss to understand why it is that the
funds set aside for gas and electrical
illumination of the City were not divided
so as to cover the entire twelve months of
the year, each month to be allowed just
so much money.
"This is a plain business arrangement,
in my mind, which should have been car
ried out on the same principle that one
regulates his own expenses to not overlap
his income.
"I consider it an outrage that the public
must spend two weeks in total darkness.
On the same principle of extravagance
daring the first few months of the fiscal
year there, is no reason why instead of
two weeks we have not been inflicted with
two months' darkness.
"I think that some provision should be
be made to meet emergencies of this sort.
Say, for instance, that the general fund
could be made available for drafts upon it
to pay for extra or additional lights that
might become necessary during the year.
In the event, however, that even the gen
eral fund became inadequate to meet the
expense, then these lights coming in as
extra illumination could be kept - ex
tinguished until the following year's ap
propriation, when they could be provided
for on the regular list.''
THE PEOPLE'S BANK SUIT
Hearing Begins Before Judge
Seawell and No End
in Sight.
Attorney F.'ournoy Explains His Con-
nection With the Pacific Bank
Sale.
Judge Seawell yesterday began the hear
ing of the case of the People against the
People's Home Savings Bank, y The suit
was instituted on the application of the
California Safe Deposit and Trust Com-
pany, which corporation holds the books
of about one-fourth of the depositors of
the defunct People's Home Savings Bank.
The complaint alleges that S. K. Thorn
ton, Eugene M. Freeman, . William H.
Phelps, John F. Sheehan, George Stone
and William P. Taylor, officers and di
rectors of the savings bank, have < mis-
managed the affairs of the institution, and
have not acted for the best interests of the
depositors, or rendered to them a true
sta tement of its affairs.
Attorney John Flournoy was the first
witness called, and he kept the stand all
day. His time was chiefly taken up in ex
plaining the sale of - the Pacific . Bank
property to the Continental y Trust Com-
pany, or at least that portion of the trans-
action with which he had anything to do.
It seems that when . the . bank became
pressed for money, it was decided by the
directors to sell .' this property, and they
were willing to accept $120,000 for it. Both

while, the board passed a resolution which
bound : them to accept $130,000; for the
building. Later, McElroy increased his
bid to $132,000, but ' the resolution of the
board so tied things up with the California

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 19, 1896.
GENERAL DIMOND
DIES IN NEW YORK.
His Leading Career in
Civil and Military
Life.
SERVICE AT THE FRONT.
He Tendered \ a Company . -; of
Troops to President
Lincoln.
NATIONAL GUARD DUTIES.
Ex-Superintendent of the Hint and
President of the Chamber of
Commerce.
Major-General William i Henry Dimond,
division commander of the National
Guard of California and* one of the best
known merchants of San Francisco, died
THE LATE MAJOR-GENERAL W. H. DIMOND.
at the Gilsey House, New York, yester
day morning at 7:30 o'clock. During his
last days, while he lay unconscious, his
life gradually passing away, he was at
tended by his son, Harry Dimond,
also by business partners in New York
and one of his old family physicians.
. General Dimond had been failing in
health for years, and some months ago
his constitution began to weaken percep
tibly, so on the advice of his physicians he
surrendered active business employment
at his office. He had two or three sinking
spells of late, and members of his family
were pained by premature newspaper arti
cles to the eftect that he was dying.
When General Dimond left San Fran
cisco early in June expecting to sail from
New York to "Europe, - June 13, he ap
peared to ; be able to stand the journey
without distress. , He ; was accompanied
by his son, Harry Dimond. The disease,
an ailment of the kidneys, akin to
Bright- disease, assumed a dangerous
phase- immediately after his arrival in
New York, and it was .soon plain that, he
could not undergo' the voyage across the
Atlantic. He, had survived several at
tacks which threatened to sever the thread
of life and displayed such wonderful re
cuperative energy that his son, Edwin R.
Dimond, and â  his . business associates,
Messrs. ChesebrougU, Sewell and. Clarke,
entertained hopes for several days that the
general would again rally. y. ..,-. y,
William Henry Dimond was born in
Honolulu, November 11, 1838, and was
therefore in his 58th year. His father, a
man of New England birth, went to Ha
waii as a missionary. General Dimond's
ancestors, dating back to his great, great
grandfather,' were New England people,
who participated in the French and Indian
wars and y valiantly fought in : the
Revolutionary war for American inde
pendence. 'His great-grandfather, Jesse
Dimond, served -. in - the war of : 1812-15,
fighting against the British.
When the great civil war of 1861 came
in the United States, William Henry Di
mond was living in Hawaii. He espoused
the cause of the Union and tendered his
services to President Lincoln, offering to
bring 100 men with him. At that particu
lar time England was seeking a pretext to
quarrel with tbe United States, so Secre
tary Seward ' advised , against 'j the accept
ance of volunteers recruited on a foreign
shore, and Dimond's offer was kindly de
clined by President Lincoln. y
yAs the war progressed young Dimond
resolved to enter the contest himself, so
he traveled 7000 miles from Honolulu to
Washington and asked; to be assigned to
duty. He was commissioned 'captain and
ordered for .* duty ; on > the ! staff ; of â Major-
Generel Rufus Saxton, then \ commanding
the Federal *. force with â¢â "' headquarters *at
Beaufort,- S. C. After ,; the * surrender of
Lee and : Johnston Captain Dimond .< re
signed,' declining to accept a commission
in the regular army. y .â',' , V "â 
After the war he made a tour of Europe
and then resumed his ; business : career in
Honolulu. In 1867 he came to San Fran
cisco, establishing ~; business connections
with ; the "firm] of * Williams, Blanchard &
Co. - In 1880, on the ; retirement of , Mr.
Blanchard, the firm '\ became : Williams,
Dimond & Co. :^ :y?X,X :Y~ -X ' '-'â¢ AX-\
.In 1880 he was appointed ;: lieutenant
colonel on the staff of Governor George C.
Perkins, and on December 1881 he was
commissioned '* brigadier-general, y Second
Brigade, N. i. G. C., succeeding . General
John McComb, who ; bad ? been appointed
warden of the Folsom Prison. He was re-"
appointed brigadier-general by Governor
Bartlett. and appointed major-general of
the ! division rby Governor,*; Waterman: on
September. 28,' 1887. He was i reappointed
major-general by, Governor Markham.and
held that rank at the time of } his death,
as 'his resignation," tendered â  a short ' time
since, : > was hot accepted *by ..'-.'â¢ Governor
Budd.y V y , " y â  yy/Y-YYYY'y
.'â¢' General Dimond was an active compan
ion of ;. the Loyal ;; Legion, and was elected
commander of the California Commandery
of the order in 1882. He was a comrade of
the Grand Arm y of the Republic, belong
ing to George H. Thomas Post, He was
chairman! of the finance committee of the
National encampment held in San Fran
cisco, and rendered excellent service. He
also served one campaign as chairman of
the Republican State .Central '; Committe.
He served three years as Park Commis
sioner, resigning that "â¢' position * when he
was appointed by President Harrison on
lhe recommendation of United States Sen
ator Stanford Superintendent of the United
States Mint in Ban Francisco. John Dag
gett was appointed by. President Cleveland
to succeed General Dimond in the Mint. ;
General Dimond's highly honorable and
active career as a merchant in this City is
well known. By personal y attention -to
business affairs, - by .2 intelligent industry
and strict integrity he gained the highest
rank in 'â . commercial ;. circles. yHe ; prized
highly the distinction which his fellow
merchants bestowed upon him when they
elected him president of the Chamber, of
Commerce in 1894. ~ y
Ten years ago. at the. Republican State
Convention held in Los Angeles, General
Dimond was a , prominent i candidate . for
the gubernatoral â  nomination." He was
warmly. sustained by * large number. of
delegates, but the prize was won by John
Swift. He was greatly disappointed in
the outcome of the proceedings, but did
not sulk in his tent or threaten to bolt
Two years later, in 1888, he went to the
National Republican Convention at Chi
cago as a delegate from California. - , ,
Two daughters and two sons of General
Dimond reside in San Francisco and one
son, Henry, the eldest, lives in Honolulu.
One daughter is the wife of Paul Jarboe
and the other is the wife of Joseph Tobin.
Edwin R. is a partner in the house of .Wil
liams, Dimond & Co. Harry Dimond is in
New York. The general's body, will be
embalmed and brought to San Francisco.
It is common belief that General Di
mond was fairly well to do in the sense of
worldly possessions, although he was not
by any means a millionaire. . He owned
stock in various enterprises and controlled
a large interest in the shipping and com
mission house of Williams, Dimond & Co.
hie was a geneious man iv every sense of
the term.
He gave freely to his comrades of the
Grand Army, and. contributed to the sup
port '; of many local institutions. In club
circles he was particularly well known.
He belonged to the Pacific- Union, the Bo
hemian and the Union League. :
His death will be greatly regretted in the
National Guard, as he always manifested a
deep interest in the welfare of that organi
zation. In respect to his memory armory
flags throughout ' the state were half
masted yesterday. In due time an official
order announcing his death will be promul
gated from general headquarters at Sacra
mento. -: â  -"; *: â â¢:".' -iÂ£-st?;':*-':' r.XIXY- X" 'YYX',

BUILDING TO
THE YOSEMITE.
Construction of the Merced
River Railway to
Begin.
CONTRACT FOR GRADING.
First One, for Forty-Six Miles,
to Be Signed Tuesday
Next.
WILL BUILD FROM MERCED.
The New. Road Will Tap the Mother
Lode and Rich Timber, and
â¢Quarry- Districts.
Everything looked particularly favorable
yesterday for the closing of a contract to
grade half the new railroad that is to con
nect ' Merced with the Yosemite Valley.
Within a week, unless some unforeseen
obstacle should come in the way, the first
shovelful of earth will be turned on the
road into the heart of the Sierras. And
from the hour that event takes place no
time will bs wasted on construction of the
road. 4
It was stated yesterday by one of the of
ficers of the company in the offices in this
City that negotiations were pending with
contractors, and the expectations were the
first contract for grading would be signed
Tuesday next. This section of the work
covers forty-six miles, a little more than
half the entire length of the road, as the
total distance â  between Merced and Yo
semite is eighty-two miles. The graders
hold themselves ready to begin operations
immediately, so the prospect of very lively
times at Merced is regarded as certain. .
Arrangements have been made for ties
and steel rails, with a view to the delivery
of this and other material' without delay
soon after the work of grading a roadbed
is in progress. ,
All building material has been con
tracted for, and now the energetic pro
moters of the Merced River and Yosemite
Railroad are in readiness to go to work in
earnest. 'j\Y"-XY:
The right of way for the entire line, ex
cepting a short gap in the vicinity of
Snelling, has been secured. Owing to an
uncertainty as to the choice of a route at
that point the directors 'â â¢; have not yet got
the right of way, but this, it was ex
plained, would not cause delay, since it
will be some time yet before the graders
will have reached the river. The choice
of two routes for a short distance is under
consideration, and it may be settled Tues
day next.
The first section will tap tbe mother
lode, the rich mining district in the
Sierras.: . *?:
â¢ It will also open up a country rich in
tim ber and marble *" and various kinds of
building stone, and when its influence is
felt in developing x that region both the
Southern Pacific and Valley roads will have
a valuable feeder in the mountain line.
The enterprise is coupled with the advent of
the Valley road into Merced, will be a ma
terial help in booming that thriving city.
With part of the Merced River road in
operation construction will be carried on
farther up along the beautiful canyon of
the Merced without cessation till the loco
motive whistles at the gates of the Yosem
ite Valley reservation will' disturb the
echoes of the wonderland. Then it will be
a pleasant railroad trip to the Yosemite,
which may .v be enjoyed by people of lim
ited means.^_2Yy
