RELEASED FROM
LONG BRANCH
The Big Steamship St. Paul
Leaves the Cradle in
the Sands.
HAULED OPF BY TUGS.
During a Blinding Snowstorm
and a Stiff Nor'easter the
Rescue Is Made.
GRADUALLY MOVED FROM SHORE
Expert Examiners Will Inspect the
Vessel to Ascertain the Amount
of Damage Done.
NEW YORK. N. V., Feb. 4.-The St.
Paul shook the sands of Long Branch
from her keel at 10 o'clock this morning
and steamed away for New iTork. Four
of the Merritt and Chapman tugs assisted
the Â©ride of the American line to free her
self from the unwelcome position in wnich
she found herself about 1 :45 a. m. of Sat
urday, January 25, 1896.
Tugs have tried their strength to get the
Bhip afloat and have failed day after day
as signally as though they were ordinary
rowboats tied to an iron pier and manned
by s-nall boys. Even the high tides at the
full of tfÂ»e moon have lacked sufficiently
potent influence on the mass of water to
work the big vessel out on the bosom of
the ocean. But yesterday came the prayed
for nor'easter. In the high water of a
nor'easter. yanked and pulled and strained
at by four of the most powerful wrecking
tugs of which the metropolis can boast,
slowly and with much effort the St. Paul
was gradually worked seaward. During
tne period between sunset and sunrise and
after sunrise, by inches and then feet and
yards, the St. Paul gradually came to her
self and to a position of usefulness.
Early this morning the St. Paul found
that she could use her steam. She as
sisted to the full of her bent the efforts of
her would-be rescuers. Her salvation was
worked out in the midst of a driving snow
storm to the tune of the corking north
easter. The northeaster brought high
t>-Â« tÂ«:r an-I a heavy sea- It duplicated the
eruditions that prevailed when the St.
Paul slid her noae into the yielding sands
of Long Branch and made her grounding
bo near the shore a possibility. Like con
ditions gave her the opportunity to get
away. ' When even hope was almost dead
the change came. When the finest ocean
greyhound ever bniit in the United States
and flying the flagjof this Republic finally
slid over the Becond bar and into thirty
nine feet of water the life-savers, boatmen
and laymen on shore and the men on the
St. Paul joined in one good, glad cry of
victory.
Telephone connections with the big liner
were off, it was hoped, forever. So far as
the eye could distinguish she was not any
the worse for the protracted visit to the
shores of New J ersey. The St. Paul passed
jn at Bandy Hook, at 11:50 o'clock, bound
for her dock in New York, carrying as bal
ia<?t about 800 tons of water. She sailed up
to the American line pier at 1 -.30 p. m. and
after half an hour's work three tugs suc
ceeded in pushing her into a berth at the
new dock adjoining the regular pier of the
American Line Company. As she ap
proached the dock she was saluted by the
different craft in the river, which salute
she acknowledged by blowing her Dig
whistle.
Expert examiners began this afternpon
to make a thorough inspection of the ship.
Tuie will require at least two days. Then
the United States steamship inspectors
will Jook over the ship and make sure she
is all right and fit for service. Everybody
connected with the St. Paul, however, ex
presses the conviction that the ship is in
no way injured.
It was announced that the American
line officials will hold an investigation
in lo the grounding of the St. Paul in a few
days. Manager Griscom says, however,
that from inquiries already made he feels
positive that Captain Jamison will fully
clear himself of all blame in the matter.
Regarding the cost of floating the St.
Paul, Manager Griscom said that it was a
tÃlvage case and he thought it would
in some way be compromised. Stories
about paying the wrecking companies
$100,000 to float the ship were unfounded,
as no stipulation had been made. The
matter might be settled in a few months
and might drag along for a year. It is

FOR SA.TIXG THE ST. PAUZ.
Some Intereatiug Itecommendation* JUnde
by Patriotic Citizen*.
Great was the interest taken in the ques
tion of floating the St. Paul from her
cradle in the sand off Long Branch. It
was argued that if not moved soon there
was great danger of the big steamship
being broken up by the combined action of
the wind and waves. The loss of the ves
sel would have been a severe blow to the
National line, which was so largely
actuated by patriotic motives in establish
ing a passenger and mail service, under
the American flag, between the United
States and Europe.
Patriotic citizens of New York and
vicinity therefor offered various sugges
tions as to the best means of saving the
stranded ship. Some went so far as to
advocate the utility of monster balloons,
while others thought it would be easy to
dredge a channel from the vessel out into
deep water.
But the wrecking company that finally
saved the St. Paul was not inspired
by sentiment. It contracted, it was
said, to float the ship for the â¢sum of
$100,000 and agreed to get nothing in
the event of failure. "While the powerful
tups were straining hawsers there was no
abatement in the interest as to the St.
Paul's fate. In one instance the unlucky
Vessel was made the subject of a cartoon,
feeing compared to the stranded state of
affairs of the United States Senate in ques
tions of finance and diplomacy.

are among those who took part in Dr.
Jameson's raid into the Transvaal and
who were captured by the Boers.
They are now en route to England in
company with the^British members of the

Cecil J. Rhodes, ex-Premier of Cape
Colony, arrived at Plymouth this morning.
He was successful in evading the many
who were on the lookout for him, and
upon leaving the steamer immediately
boarded a train for London.

SERIOUS TROUBLE FEARED
Republicans in Kentucky's Legis
lature May Unseat Two
Democrats.
Ladies Warned to Keep Away, for
Lively Row and Shooting
Is Expected.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 4.â Serious
trouble may occur at to-morrow's joint
session of the House Republicans to un
seat Tomkins and Kaufman. It is said
that within five minutes after the unseat
ing the Senate Democrats have arranged
to expel four Republican Senators, ap
point doorkeepers to keep them out of the
joint session and take a ballot for United
States Senator. Ladies are warned to
keep away to-morrow.
Kaufman is a clothing merchant of Lex
ington, of high standing in business and
social circles. He is a Democrat of long
standing, a strong advocate of free silver,
and will stand by Blackburn to the end.
His seat is contested by Woods Dunlap of
Lexington, who comes of good Republican
stock. He is a lawyer by profession, but
has been more or less absorbed in political
contests for many years back, and has had
the fruits of one or two places under the
National Government. The attempt to
unseat Kaufman is very likely to cause
serious trouble. Much depends upon

CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, Feb. 4.â
The reported existence of a Etrain between
the United States and Turkey in conse
quence of the rigorous and persistent
measures adopted by United States Minis
ter Terrell for the protection of American
missionaries is wholly without founda
tion. As regards protection of American
citizens and the payment of indem
nity by the Turkish Government
for the destruction by fire of American
buildings it will be recalled that none of
the Â£28,000 demanded by the three chief
powers of Europe for the killing and
wounding of the foreign consuls at Jeddah
last May has yet been obtained by the
powers, nor has anybody as yet been pun
ished for the outrage.
The United States cruiser San Francisco
is at Messina, Asia Minor, on the Mediter
ranean. Letters describing the misery
prevailing among the inhabitants at Mar
ash and Oorfa were read on board the ship
and the sailors made up a purse of $450
for the relief of the sufferers. The situa
tion at Marash has become more critical.
A number of European war vessels are
gathering at Alexandria.
The houses occupied by Armenians in
Bmyrna were marked for a week. J. H.
Madden, the United States Consul at that
place, made inquiries of the Government
regarding the reasons for so designating
Armenian residences, and entered a vigor
ous protest against such a proceeding.
A large quantity of arms have been

found in a mosque at Smyrna, which, it is
supposed, had been placed there for use
against the Armenians in the event of an
outbreak at that place. The Christians,
however, considerably outnumber the
Moslems, and it is not regarded as likely
that any massacre will be attempted in
that city.

The question of admitting an American

LONDON, En-g., Fe : : 4.â The Chronicle
(Liberal), apparently inspired j from a high
Liberal quarter, will to-morrow say that it
is tlÂ« intention.'of;the 'Liberals at the
earliest possible moment after - the ' reas
semblin;* of Parliament ;'t to vigorously
challenge the Government â¢on its policy
toward the Armenians. 'The paper adds
that this course is likely to elicit very uh
ezpected revelations regarding the action
of previous Ministries.
The Chronicle will further say it believes
that instead of offering an amendment
relative to the Venezuelan dispute to the
address in reply to the Queen's speech the
opposition will move, immediately after
the debate on the address, the adjourn
ment of the House of Commons, in order
to fully discuss the Venezuelan matter,
and that probably a motion in favor of
arbitrating the dispute will be submitted.
The Chronicle's" article fully confirms
the statements that were made last Satur
day by the United Press relative to the
course that would be followed by the Lib
erals.
WAS BLOWN UP AT SEA
An Explosion That May Account
for the Disappearance of
the Wildflower.
The Vessel Was Laden With Petrc
leum and Carried a Large
Crew.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 4.-Captain
Anderson of the tank steamer Phosphor,
which got into port to-day after a twenty
day trip from Shields, told a story that
probably accounts for the non-arrival in
England of the British tank steamer
Wildflower, which left Philadelphia for
Rouen, France, on December 11, and has
never been heard of since. The vessel had
1,300,000 gallons of petroleum on board.
Captain Anderson says that just before
he sailed from Shields on January 18 he
heard a story that convinced him that the
Wildflower had made her last voyage.
It was this: The steamship Loch Etive,
from New York December 24 for Cork, re
ported on her arrival there on January 8
that about 250 miles west-southwest from
the coast of Ireland, on January 6, the
crew saw a sudden glare in the sky. As
far as the eye could see to the westward
the sky was a vivid red for a moment, and
then it died out slowly until in half an
hour the sea was again in darkness. A few
seconds after the first glare' a dull roar like
the discharge of a heavy gun made the
Loch Etive vibrate and rock.
When Captain Anderson found that the
Wildflower had not yet made port he be
came convinced that the dare-up was the
explosion of oil in the Wildflower's tanks.
There were twenty-nine men on the miss
ing vessel. She was in command of Cap
tain Stanwell.

MAINTAINED A GALLING FIRE.
General Campos Returned to Madrid

Hoots.
â 
HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 4â The details of
a fight yesterday between the troops under
General Luqui and the rebels under Anto
nio Afaceo have been received here. Gen
eral Luqui reports that the battle occurred
in and near the town of Paso Real, prov
ince of Pinar del Rio. Maceo was in chief
command of the insurgents, his subordin
ate commanders being Miro, Sayas, Chil
eno and Meyer.
When it was learned that the rebels
were in Paso Real General Luqui gave
orders for the troops to advance and at
tack the place. The soldiers entered the
town by the main street and found the
rebels occupyinc the side streets and the
houses. A galling fire was directed
against the troops from the street, houses
and roofs, but the .rebels were finally
driven to the eastern part of the town,
where they attempted to make a stP.nd.
In this they were unsuccessful, and they
then retreated outside the town.
The troops advanced upon them and
found over a thousand rebels forming a
line of battle in an open space. As the
Spaniards moved forward they delivered
volley fires as they moved from position to
position. The rebel cavalry charged the
troops with great valor, and despite the
heavy, fire directed against them, even
reached the bayonets of the troops. The
latter received the first charge while form
ing in line, but the second charge was re
ceived by the troops in circular groups.
General Luqui says the troops sustained
no machete wounds, while a number of
rebels were wounded by bayonets. The
troops finally dispersed, the rebels pursu
ing them until darkness set in.
The insurgents lost sixty-two killed,
while 200 of them are believed to have been
wounded. General Luqui was shot through
the right leg. Major Jose Ruiz Perez, of
the regular army, and Major Louis Lopez
Majorez, of the civil guaFds, were also
wounded. Major Perez has since died. In
addition to those, one captain, one lieu
tenant and thirty soldiers were wounded.
One of the wounded privates died shortly
after the battle. J. Frank Clark.

MADRID, Spain, Feb. 4.â General Cam
pos arrived here at 10 :40 o'clock this even
ing. Most of the Ministers and a number
of men prominent in political life met him
at the railway station and he was given a
cordial welcome.
Quite a crowd assembled outside the
station, and when Campos appeared he
was cheered. There was some hooting
and whistling as he drove to his residence,
but the gendarmes were vigilant and
drove off those who attempted to insult
General Campos. Some of the more per
sistent hooters were arrested. One es
caped from iiia captors and attempted to
runaway. The gendarmes fired twice at
him and killed him.
A crowd gathered at the Valladolid Rail
way station, and When the train arrived
on which General Campos was traveling
to Madrid some of the assemblage hooted
at him. A few of the crowd cheered, but
it was evident that popular feeling was
against him for his failure to suppress the
insurrection in Cuba. A number of police
were sent to the station and some of the
hooters were arrested.
A majority of the newspapers here are
indignant with General Compos for sug
gesting that autonomy should be granted
to Cuba. They declare that the sugges
tion is an insult to the nation after the sac
rifices it has made.
XOT TO Z,UrX A WAR TAX.

Customs Duties.
MADRID, Spain, Feb. 4.â The Cabinet
has rejected the proposal to levy a war tax
to meet the expenses of a campaign in
Cuba and has also decided not to increase
the customs duties in Cuba. It has re
solved to amend the tariff with a view to
augmenting the revenue. Spanish products
will lose some of their protection in Cuba
and gain increased protection in the Fhil
iDpine Islands. The Cabinet agreed to in
crease tbe capital of the Cubau and Phil
ippine banks.
PLEASES THE PRINCE OF WALES.
Has No Fault to Find With the Investi-

Club's Committee.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 4.â The Chronicle
will to-morrow say that the Prince of
Wales, who is commodore of the Royai
Yacht Squadron, has earnestly counseled
Lord Dunraven to keep well in mind the
desirability of promoting friendship
between the representatives of sports and
peoples. The Prince considers that the
terms of the finding of the committee of
inquiry of the New York Yacht Club offer
great encouragement in this direction.
There is reason to believe that action lead
ing to a very happy ending of the trouble
will shortly be taken. Lord Dunraven, it
is said, visited the Prince of Wales at
Sandnngham for the purpose of asking
his advice as to the course he should
pursue in view of the verdict of the. com
mittee which investigated the charges he
made against the Defender syndicate.

WANTS HEAVY DAMAGES
Mrs. Spalding's Suit Against
the Pullman Palace-Car
Company.
Claims to Have Been Arrested by
Employes for the Purpose of
Robbery.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 4.â Mrs. Lydia
Spalding, who is a hotel keeper in San
Francisco, brought suit to-day in the Su
perior Court against the Pullman Palace
Car Company and the Denver and Rio
Grande Railroad Company, claiming $100,
--000 damages and alleging false arrest and
imprisonment.
The bill state's that in June last Mrs.
Spalding was traveling from San Fran
cisco to Europe, and that when the Rio
Grande train stopped at Leadville she was
taken from the Pullman sleeper by a Dep
uty Sheriff and locked in jail. She de
clares she was only told she was under ar
rest and that no charge was ever made
against her nor was she taken into court.
After being forty-eic.ht hours in a tilthy
room with ten male prisoners, she was re
leased. The plaintiff also claims to have
lost $8000 in money, jewelry and steam
ship and railroad tickets, being oDliged to
buy new tickets in order to proceed to
Europe.
It is charged that the arrest was insti
gated by the Pullman Company employes
for the purpose of robbery. When she re
turned to San Francisco Mrs. Spalding
says her friends regarded her with sus
picion and her character has been placed
under a cloud.

THE SOUTHEEN PACIFIC FIGHT.
Senator Goebel's Biil to Be Considered
at Once and Reported for
Passcge.
FRANKFORT, Kv., Feb. 4.- Until
within the past few days not many mem
bers of the Legislature and few people of
this State generally had any idea that the
great Southern Pacific Railroad Company,
which they knew of only in a general way,
owed its birth to the pliant and persuad
able Legislature of this State. They knew
that the Legislature of 1883-84 and some
before it and after it had fastened many an
odious measure upon the people of Ken
tucky and passed many a venal measure
for the benefit of individuals and corpora
tions belonging at home, but they little
dreamed that among their nefarious acts
\ was one which save birth to an instru
[ ment which, in the hands of conscieuce
less conspirators, was being used as a li
| cense to enthrall and plunder the citizens
of sister States and a means of defying the
laws which are made to protect their lives
and their property.
Though a portion of the State is suffer
ing under a similar curseâ from the char
ter of the Newport News and Mississippi
Valley Company, under which Hunting
ton's roads in this State are operatedâ
their troubles and oppressions are mild
compared to what their brethren in Cali
fornia are suffering.
Theanti-Huntington literature that has
been sent to Frankfort has been a source
of surprise to the members of the Legisla
ture, and to mt-ny of them a great mortifi
cation, and they have made up their
minds to wipe out the disgrace. A great
many of them will certain! y siaud to their
convictions to the end and support Goe
bel's bill, no matter what influences are
brought to bear against it. But there are
others who are not so stable, who, un
trammeled and uninfluenced, would sup
port the bill to the end, but are liable to
trade their votes on this question for sup
port for some measure on which they are
specially interested. Huntington has a
st rong force now on the scene of action
and they are well advised as to the special
interests which the several members have
in the various bills that have bren and arc
yet to be introduced, and they are secur
ing and fixing pledges for votes every day
by the system of trading which has long
been in vogue at Frankfort.
Some of the members do not realize what
the failure of the repeal bill means to the !
people of California, but many others of
those opposing do fully realize what they
are about to do, and are doing it for a "con
sideration" of one kind or another. The!
lobby is rich in considerations, fertile in
resources and entirely unscrupulous as to
the methods they employ. This does not
apply to some of the local men who are
here in support of the bill, and who, while
they will use every influence that their
social and political connections give them
to compass the defeat of the bill, will not
do Huntington's work for him at any
price, nor will he call upon them to doit.
For such work he has men specially
trained, who are not eloquent and talk
little, but when they know their man and
the occasion is opportune can say a word
or two, accompanied by an "object les
son," which settles the matter satisfac
torily.
The excerpts from the Colton letters,
which have been largely read by the mem
bers, will make the shady fellows very
careful, if not deter some of them alto
gether from any deal, but efforts will ba
made to overcome their fears. 60 far the
committee having charge of the distribu
tion of "Repeal" literature has done quite2
well and enlightened those who were be
fore practically ignorant of the real state
of affairs thst had grown up under the
Southern Pacific charter, but they should
go furtner. This Legislature is largely
composed of new men, who are, as a rule,
more faithful to ante-election pledges and
more afraid of public opinion at their
homes than after they ha.ye served a year
or two.
Under the statutes of Kentucky railroad
companies doing business in the State
must pay an annual license of $250. Sec
tion 8 of the Southern Pacific charter says
that, "The company shall keep an office
for the transaction of business and the
clerk or assistant clerk of said corporation
shall reside within the State of Kentucky,"
etc.
Now this has never been repealed as
noted before in these dispatches. The
company has no such office in the State,
nor has it ever had as far as can be learned,
certainly not in the city of Louisville, as
has been shown, or in this City. Section
9 provided that the act should take effect
from its passage. So the law of Kentucky,
as embodied in the very act by which it
exists, has been defied by this Southern
Pacific Company for fifteen. years.
It has likewise ignored the statute pro
viding for the $250 license. Auditor Stone,
after an examination of the books in his
office, says positively that there is no rec
ord of any such license ever having been
paid.
ThiÂ» defiance of the law in the one case,
and the ignoring of it in the other, may
prove of vital concern to the Southern
Pacific Company. It may try to get over
the failure to keep an office in the State,
but it cannot in any possible manner ex
plain away the failure to pay the license.
Auditor Stone is a man that cannot be
influenced in any way. Nothing the lobby
can do can alter the record on these two
points for the past years, and the opinion
is confidently expressed that the two
together form sufficient ground to work a
forfeiture ot the charter, should the repeal
bill lail to pass.
How these two matters escaped the vigi
lant eye oi General Echols during all these
years is a matter of no small wonder to
those who kuow him and how careful he
is to ieave no point of attack un watched.
He certainly could not have let the license
remain unpaid for the sake of the money,
nickel-grabbing and penurious as the Ken
tucky management is.
There is only one way to account for it
and that is that the idea oi a Legislature
other than Democratic and which he could
not control easily through his usual per
suasive and genial ways, and have them
pass anything he wanted in the way of
protection from assault or correction of
fault never entered his head. He has
served Huntington well, and earned every
cent of what is paid him, however much it
may be, but he has made a grave on-ission
in this matter.
WILL BE COySIDEJCED TO-DAT.
The Repeal Bill to Be Beard in the Sen
ate Committee.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 4.â lf there
was ever such a thing as a great monopoly
working under cover for the defeat of a
legislative measure it is the attitude of the
Southern Pacific road against the repeal
bill. Huntington has been expected daily
during the present week, and he is known
to be here by proxj in the person of Hon.
St. John Boyls of Louisville, assisted by
lawyers, including the ex-Chief Justice of
the Court of Appeals. Matter continues
to flow in and personal letters have been
received from Huntington as feelers. He
thinks in this manner and through his
lieutenants to be more effective than by
his presence.
There will be a meeting of the committee
to-morrow afternoon for the consideration
of the bill, and Senator Goebel, the author
of the bill, told The Call correspondent
this evening that he has given notice to
the parties to appear. There seems little
doubt that they will be here and argue the
case, but it is a foregone conclusion that
the bill will be reported unanimously from
the committee and its passage will be
urged with all possible dispatch.
SLIGHT EARTHQUAKE SHOCKS.
They Were Felt in Nebraska, lowa and
South Dakota, and Lasted Sev
eral Seconds.
OMAHA, Nebr., Feb. 4.â Earthquake
shocks were felt generally over Northeast
ern NebrasKa early this morning. The
shocks at Carroll, Bloomlield, Wayne,
Nebr., ana Yankton, S. D., were quite
strong. From Butte, Nebr., a special
comes saving that that vicinity was visited
by an earthquake shock about 6 o'clock
this merninj:. The vibration was from
east to west and laÃled for a period of fif
teen or twenty seconds.
The shock was much more severe along
the Missouri River. About fifteen miles
north of this place the ground is very
warm, and in some places the smoke and
heat is so intense that it is unendurable.

SUBSTITUTE FOR
THE TIFF BILL
Such Recommendation Is
Made by the Finance
Committee.
SENATORS PAVOR SILVER
Chairman Morrill Submits the
Report, but Does Not
Support It.
MAT SOON BE RECOMMITTED.
For the Second Time the Upper House
of Congress Is Asked to Open Mints
to the White Metal.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 4.â The
proposition to open the mints of the
United States to the free and unlimited
coinage of silver was presented to the Sen
ate to-day for a second time by the Finance
I Committee. This time it came forward as
a substitute to the House tariff bill, just as
on the former occasion it appeared as a
substitute to the House bond bill. The
chairman of the Finance Committee, Mar
rill (R.) of Vermont, in making the report
said that he had reported against it in
committee, but would, nevertheless, ask
the Senate to-morrow to pioceed to its
consideration.
A resolution was offered by Quay (R.) of
Pennsylvania to recommit the report of
the Finance Committee, with instructions
to report back the original bill and the
substitute as separate propositions, but
that resolution went over till to-morrow
owing to an objection on the part of Hill
(D.) of New York to its immediate consid
eration.
The proposition to amend tne rules of
the Senate by distributing Ihe appropria
tion bills among the several committees
naving charge of the branch of the service
to which they apply, occupied the Senate
during the remainder of the day's session.
By a vote of 25 to 44 the Senate refused to
taKe up the urgent deficiency bill and, by
a vote of 40 to 24, it decided to take up the
resolution of Dubois (R.) of Idaho to
amend the rules. The resolution was dis
cussed until 5:30, when it went over with
out action.
The Journal to be read to-day covering
the doings of the Senate on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday last, which, by the
parliamentary device of recesses instead
of adjournments constituted one legis
lative day. was so long that its reading
was interrupted by a motion to dispense
with the reading, which was agreed to.
Morrill (R.) of Vermont, chairman of
the Finance Committee, reported back
from that committee the House bill "to
temporarily increase revenue to meet the
expenses of the Government and provide
against a deficiency," with an -amendment
to strike out all after the enact,ing. clause
and to insert in lieu thereof the free coin
age substitute adopted by the Senate last
Saturday. He added, jocosely, that he
would like using the words closing the
proclamation of the Governor of Massa
chusetts: "God save the commonwealth."
Also that it was unnecessary for him to
say that he did not favor the action of the
Finance Committee, but he would endea
vor to bring it up to-morrow, unless it
should interfere with an appropriation bill.
The substitute having been read at the
request of Quay (R.) of Pennsylvania,
Quay moved to recommit the report to the
Finance Committee, with instructions to
report back the original House bill and
amendment as separate propositions.
The motion was declared out of order at
the suggestion of Hill (D.) of New York,
and when Quay asked unanimous consent
for his motion Hill objected.
Among the numerous bills reported and
placed on the calendar weTe the following:
Granting a pension of $100 a month to
the widow of General Thomas Ewihg; also
a pension of $200 a month to the widow of
the late Walter Q. Gresham.
The military academy appropriation bill,
which Teller (R.) of Colorado said he
would call up to-morrow.
The general pension appropriation bill,
which Allison (R.) of lowa said he would
call up at an early day.
The bill to prevent the desecration of the
National flag.
Turpie(D.)of Indiana introduced a joint
resolution to amend the constitution so as
to have United States Senators elected by
direct vote of the people, and said that he
would address the Senate upon it next
Thursday.
Quay (R.) of Pennsylvania offered a reso
lution to recommit the House tariff bill
with the free silver substitute to the
Finance Committee with instructions to
report them as separate propositions, and
asfced for immediate consideration.
The objection came again from Hill and
the resolution went over until to-morrow.
At 2 o'clock the Senate took up Dubois'
resolution for the distribution of appro
priation bills and it was made the 'regular
order," after which it was laid aside tem
porarily and the urgent deficiency appro
priation bill was taken up, but it, too, was.
laid aside.
A long discussion ensued over the par
liamentary status of Dubois' resolution.
Finally the discussion proceeded on the
merits of Duboia' proposition.
Sherman <R.) of Ohio spoke generally in
its favor and said that there should be no
feeling about it on the part of the Com
mittee on Appropriations.
The resolution was advocated by Lodge
(R.) of Massachusetts as a necessary and
beneficial change, and by Blanchard (D.)
of Louisiana as a measure of rescue from
the "monopolistic dominance" of the
Committee on Appropriations, white it
was opposed by Hale (R.)of Maine as a
revolutionary movement.
At 5:30 the matter "went. over without
action- and the Senate went into executive
session, adjourning shortly afterward.

the Substitute.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 4.â The
Senate Finance Committee ordered the
tariff bill to be reported amended so as to
strike out all after the enacting clause and
substituting for it the free coinage of silver.
Shortly after the committee met at 11
o'clock Morrill, the chairman, announced
that he and his Republican associates were
determined that the tariff bill should be
reported to the Senate to-day in some

shape, either as it came from the House
with amendments, or adversely.
Then Vest of Missouri said that the
matter had been discussed by the silver
men of the committee, and they believed
that the proper disposition of .the subject
was to be found in a motion which he
would make. He then moved to strike
out all after the enacting clause and sub
stitute therefor a provision for the free
and unlimited coinage of silver.
This motion prevailed by the following
vote:
For the substituteâ Jones (Silver) of Ne
vada, Voorhees of Indiana, Harris of Ten
nessee; Vest of Missouri, Jones of Ar
kansas, White of California and Walthall
of Mississippi, all Democrats; total, 7.
Against the substitute â Morrill of Ver
mont, Sherman of Ohio, Allison of lowa,
Aldrich of Rhode Island, Platt of Con
necticut and Wolcott of Colorado, Repub
licans; total, 6.
Wolcott, although a silver man, is re
corded against the substitute, for the
reason that at the last meeting of the com
mittee he was in favor of the bill as it
came from the House. With Wolcott so
voting tbe majority of thÂ« substitute is
one â that situation- being made possible
through the action of Jones of Nevada,,
who has heretofore acted in unison with
the Republicans on tariff questions.
Republicans, while professing to believe
that they can pass the bill, seem to have
reached a point where they are willing to
permit the silver element of the Senate to
do anything of which it may be capable,
and for which it may have the strength,
so that the country may know in whose
hands the power in the Senate-lies. They
will, therefore, urge speedy action so that
the result may be definitely determined,
and the question, so far as this Congress
is concerned, disposed of finally.
SILVER ItEPVBZ.ICA.JSS OBJECT.
JDÂ© Aot JLifce the Substitute for the Tariff
Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 4.â During
the day silver Republicans had ample op
portunity to confer together about the ac
tion of the Finance Committee, and there
is reason to believe that they will almost
unanimously vote to kill the substitute re
ported to the Senate, believing it is not in
the interest but disadvantageous to the
silver cause. Many Senators expressed
their intention of supporting Quay's mo
tion to recommit with instructions to sep
arate the subject matter and bring iÂ»two
different bills, but the Democrats on both
sides of the silver question will vote against
this.
While the silver Republicans will thus
probably support the committee free
coinage substitute it looks as if the admin
tration men in the Senate, who have vig
orously opposed free coinage, will vote to
fasten that sort of legislation upon the
tariff bill for the purpose of killing it on
the ground that the end justifies the
means.
HELD UP THE CASHIER
Daring Theft of a Bag of Money
From a Standard Oil
Officer.
Bat the Young Highwayman Was Pur
sued and Quickly Cap
tured.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Feb. 4.â C F.
Vauly, cashier of the Standard Oil Com
pany, was held up on Harrison street, be
tween Nineteeth and Twentieth, at 11:30
o'clock this morning and roboed of $543,
which he was taking to the bank.
Pauly left the office of the Standard Oil
Company at Twentieth and Harrison
streets to make a deposit in the Metropol
itan National Bank. He had to walk east
to take a Troost-avenue car. About mid
way between Harrison street and Troost
avenue he met a young man who, on see
ing the large bag of money in Pauly's
hand, made a grab for it. Pauly jumped
aside and the young man failed to reach
the money. Drawing a 38-caliber revolver,
the young man raised the weapon to
Pauly's face with the remark: "Drop
that money."
Pauly did so. Grabbing it up, the bold
highwayman started west to Harrison
street, on which he turned south. Pauly
started in- pursuit, shouting "thief" at
th.c top of his voice. A crowd of men and
boys joined in the chase, and finally, after
the highwayman had run about 100 yards,
Officer Ryan came up and caught and dis
armed him. After a short search the
money was recovered. At the Grand
avenue police station the highwayman
gave the name of John Scary. He said he
lived at 511 West Twenty-third street with
his brother, Edward Scary. He is -about

PRESENTED BY DINGLEY.
But the Minority Favors the Free
Coinage of Silver, Says
Crisp.
SEVERAL MEASURES PASSED.
There Is a Promise of Discord in the
District of Columbia Appropria
tions Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 4.âlmme
diately upon the opening of the session of
the House to-day, Dingley (R.) of Maine,
chairman of the Committee on Ways and
Means, reported with a recommendation
that the House do not concur in the Sen
ate substitute therefor, the bill passed in
December, authorizing the issue of bonds
to protect the gold reserve and to provide
against temporary deficiencies in the
revenue.
Crisp (D.) of Georjgia stated that the re
port was not a unanimous one â that the
minority of the committee urged the
House to accept the Senate's free silver
coinage substitute.
Dingley gave notice that, *t the close of
the consideration of the District of Colum
bia appropriation bill, he would ask the
House to take up the committee's report.
By unanimous consent a number of
measures were consdered and passed.
The rest of the day until 4 :50 o'clock was
spent in further consideration of the Dis
trict of Columbia appropriations. The de
bate continued upon the question whether
or not public funds should be appropriated
for charitable purposes, to be expended by
private or sectarian institutions. The
charge that the A, P. A. was influencing
memberÃ to oppose such appropriations
was made, and at times some heat was
generated in the debate.
By its votes the House in the committee
of the whole indicated its purpose to vote
no money to strictly sectarian institutions
and only to such other private institutions
as would so amend their articles of incor
poration as to permit Government inspec
tion and oversight of the expenditure of
public funds. The consideration of the
bill was completed in the committee of the
whole, but before a vote was taken in the
House adjournment was taken.
By unanimous consent the following bills
were considered and passed:
House bill authorizing the appointment
of commissioners to treat with the Sho
shones, Arapanoe and Bannock Indian?'
located in Wyoming and Idaho, for the
surrender of any rights they may claim
under treatit. to hunt upon unoccupied
public lands. This bill grows out of the
Jacksons Hole outbreak of last summer.
Lenate bill to amend the railroad land
grant forfeiture act by adding the proviso
"That where such purchasers, their
heirs or assigns have paid only a portion
of the purchase price to the company,
which is less than the Government price
of similar lands, they shall be required
before the delivery of patent for their
lands to pay to the Government a sum
equal to the difference between the por
tion of the purchase price so paid and the
Government price, end in such case the
amount demanded from the company
shall be the amount paid to it by such
purchaser."
Granting rights of way through Indian
and Oklahoma territories to the St. Louis,
Oklahoma and Southern Railway.
Loud (R.) of California, had read the
memorial of the San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce urging Congress to provide
for the construction of the Nicaragua canal
under American control. Re'erred.
The House at 1 o'clock p. m. went into
Committee of the Whole for the furt:Â»Â«r
consideration of the District of Columbia
bill. The debate on the bill lasted until
5:10 p. m., principally on appropriations
for local chanties, which were, as a rule,
voted down, and at that time the bill was
favorably reported, and the House ad
journed until to-morrow.

Bow It Was Decided to Report Son-
Concurrence.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 4.â The
House Corumittee on. Ways and Means to
day disposed of the House bond bill with
the Senate free-coinage substitute by
directing Chairman Dingiey to report it
to the House with the recommendation
that the House non-concur in the Senate
amendments.
There Was little or no discussion of the
measure, its diposition being effected by
one vote. As soon as tLe committee was
called to order the the bill as amended
was read, after which Dingley moved to
non-concur in the Senate amendments.
Crisp (D.) of Georgia, moved to amend by
making a motion to report the bill back to
the House with the recommendation that
the Senate amendments be concurred in.
The vote was taken on the latter motion
and resulted : Ayes 4, no-s 11. The vote
in detail was: Ayesâ Crisp, McMillin,
Wheeler and McLauren. Noesâ Dalzell,
Hopkins, Grosvenor, Dolliver, Steele,
Johnson, Evans, Tawuey, Turner, Taraney
and Dingley.
The motion to non-concur was agreed to
without division. After the vote an at
tempt was made to agree to a programme
when the measure reached the House.
Nothing definite was decided upon, but a
general understanding was had that the
bill should be called up as soon as the
District oi Columbia appropriation bill
had been disposed of and that two days
would be given to its consideration.
After the bond bill was disposed of the
resolution of Howard of Alabama calling
upon the President for information regard
ing the issue of bonds was taken up and
after a brief discussion was laid on the
table. A substitute for it calling upon the
Secretary of the Treasury for the amount
of bonds disposed of by political periods
since 1875 was agreed to and Dalzell was
directed to report it- to the House.
The committee then considered and
directed Evans of Kentucky to report
favorably a bill introduced by Cumiuings
of New York, providing forfeiture,, tine
and imprisonment for handling any
spirituous or fermented liquors or wines
under any other than the proper name
and brand. Tne committee then ad
journed until to-morrow.

STIREED UP BY MR. FERKINS.
Preparations of Plans and the Letting
of Contracts Will Be Pro

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 4.-In re
sponse to a resolation introduced by Rep
resentative Loud and adopted by the
House the Secretary of the Treasury
to-day sent to Congress the following mes
sage:
Treasury Department, Office of Secretary.
Sir: In response to a resolution passed by
the House of Representatives on the 21st inst.,
requesting the Secretary of the Treasury to in
form the House what progress has been made
under the act for the erection of a postoffice
building at San Francisco and the reason for
delay in the prosecution and completion of
said building, I have the honor to state as fol
lows:
Upon the passage of said act of March 3,
1893, fixing the limit of cost for the new post
office, courthouse; etc., the plans and estimates
for said works were taken under considera
tion by the supervising architect. On June 12,
1893, however, the department received a com
munication from the chairman of the Commit
tee on Public Buildings and Grounds of the
House of Representatives requesting that no
action be taken in regard to the erection of
said building on the site which had been se
lected until the House of Representatives
should have an opportunity to enter an inves
tigation in regard to the matter.
In deference to said request, the department
on June 23 directed that action relative to the
preparation of plans and estimates for the
building be suspended until further orders.
No further steps were taken until October 5,
1893, when, in response to a resolution, the
Secretary of the Treasury transmitted to the
House of Representatives all the papers relat
ing to' the selection and purchase cf the site.
These papers were retained by the House of
Representatives until June 9, 1894, when they
were returned to the department.
Early in the spring of 1894 work on the
plans for said building was renewed, sketch
plans and estimations were made and ap
proved by the Secretary of the Treasury, Secre
tary of tLe -Interior and Postmaster-ueneral
and the pieparation of working drawings en
tered on, which drawings were sufficiently
under way to admit of the invitation for pro
posals for the work of excavating for founda
tions when Congress, by the act approved
March 2, 1895, directed "that before any work
is done upon the building or contract let
therefor, the Secretary of the Treasury shall
cause to be carefully examined the nature of
subsoil and bed of foundation of the
site purchased for such building and
whether the character of the same is
proper ior building, and what will be the cost
of making a foundation and whether the con
struction of the building shall be proceeded
with on said site; and the Secretary of War,
upon request of the Secretary of the Treasury,
shall detail two or more engineer officers of
the army to make such examination," said
officers submitted a report on the examination
made by them, setting forth the result of bor
ings, etc., furnishing drawings to show the
location, etc., of said test pits, and concluding
with an opinion that the foundations should
be of concrete, and that the proposed building
can be safely constructed on the site selected;
and further, that no reason is apparent, from
an engineering point of view, why erection of
building should not be proceeded with.
The officers named estimated the total cost
of sucii foundation as they recommended to
bfe $30,549. The prosecution of this work thus
interfered with its regular course has pro
ceeded as rapidly as the prcsure of current
matters would allow. The work cm the pre
paration of drawings has been resumed and
they will be completed and contracts made as
soon as possible. Respectfully yours,
J. G. Carlisle, Secretary.
To the Speaker of the House of Representa
tives.
It will be remembered that in response
to a letter from Judge McKenna an inquiry
was made of the supervising architect
concerning the plans of the new building.
This letter was taken to Supervising Arch
itect Aiken by Senators White and Per
kins and left with that official. After a
long talk regarding the proposed building
Aiken promised to reply, but after a lapse
of a time long enough to have completed
the plans of Judge McKenna's courtroom
it was thought the supervising architect
had forgotten his promise.
So Senator Perkins wrote to him again,
recalling the visit and the letter and stat
ing that it having been understood from
him that money was necessary to complete
plans he would be pleased to be informed
of the amount needed to supply the extra
help to perfect the plans. Still no answer
came, A messenger was sent to Aiken 10
get from him verbally the figures needed
to insert in the bill which Senator Perkins
had prepared, designed to supply funds
which would enable the Postoffice plans to
be completed and work on the new build
ing to be commenced. Aiken promised to
reply by letter, bttt never did so. Other
efforts were made to secure data necessary
to enable Congress to take action, but
Aiken did not reply.
On January 30 another letter was written
by Senator Perkins, in which ne called at
tention to his former communication and
to a promise that a reply would be given
to the inquiries of Judge McKenna's let
ter, that an answer might be made to the
Judge. It was assumed that Aiken would
not be so discourteous as to refuse to reply
to the many inquiries made and that the
letter had gone astray. This brought forth
a reply, bnt not such as was expected. It
was in the form of a letter from Secretary
NEW TO-DAY.

JOHN CAFFREY,
47 First street, San Francisco,
HEPRESEKTING
[ Charles Graef & Co., N. V., for Mineral Waters
Carlisle, per Aiken, in answer to Senator
Perkins' communication, in which he said â¢
"I have to advise you that the department
considers it impracticable to give the in
formation desired. If, however, the com
mittee, either in the Senate or House
should ask for information as to what steps
the department would advise to be taken
to facilitate and hasten the construction
of public buildines such request would be
complied with."
Here, at least, was something definite.
Aiken, through Secretary Carlisle, refused
to give the amount which Aiken (as archi
tect) said was necessary to complete the
postoffice plans so work might be com
menced. But still there was no reply from
the recalcitrant architect.
At last it was determined to take an
other course of action, and a messenger
was sent to the architect's office to recover
the letter of Judge McKenna, which had
been ignored as completely as had the per
sonal requests and communications of the

IS IN ERUPTION
Smoke Now Pouring Forth
From the Snow-Capped
Mountain.
SEEN FROM SAN JACINTO.
Dense Volumes Puffed Skyward
as Though From a Railroad
Locomotive.
WAS INACTIVE FORI.CENTTJRIES
Scientific Investigation and Indian Tra
dition Give Proof of Former
Eruptions.
SAN JACINTO. Cat,., Feb. 4.â There is
considerable excitement here over what
appears to be aii eruption of a part of the
San Jacinto Mountains called Tanquitz
Peak, twenty miles distant. The streets
of San Jacinto have to-day been crowded
with people looking through telescopes at
ominous clouds of smoke which have hung
over Tanquitz.
When first noticed at 9 o'clock this
morning the vicinity of the peak was hazy
with smoke. "Within the next hour this
smoky mist cleared away and through the
glasses leveled at the summit ihe gazers
were able to detect a straight line of
smoke ascending skyward. Soon this thin
streak disappeared and then the smoke
began rolling upward in clouds as though
puffed from a railroad locomotive. San
Jacinto people looked on in blank amaze
ment, and throughout the day continued
to gaze at this unusual phenomenon.
The smoke has continued to pour out of
Tanquitz all day, and fear of an eruption
has caused great excitement. It is believed
word will soon reach here from people
who live in Strawberry Valley, located
four miles from the foot of Tanquitz Peak.
People of Strawberry Valley have fre
quently in the past heard explosions,
seemingly occurring in the interior of the
peak. Because of these rumblings, and
from the fact that scientists have declared
that Tanquitz Peak harbors an extinct
volcano, dwellers in the surrounding
valleys have long Been in fear of an erup
tion. Indians who live in the neighbor
hood recite traditions of a time when this
was a "lire-mountain," and a prophet of
the tribe not long ago predicted another
eruption to occur soon.

A Thin Cloud of Smoke Envelop* the
>'note- Capped 2'eak.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Feb. 4.â A
volcano appears to be in eruption in
Mount Tanquitz, which is situated about
twenty miles northeast of San Jacinto.
Trainmen who arrived in this city this
nif-riag reported that smoke was aeen is
frora the mountain, and it is thought
that after centuries of inactivity the crater
has again become opened by some subter
ranean disturbance.
From this city a thin cloud, apparently
of smoke, can be seen hoverine over the
peak. It cannot be from a forest fire, as
the mountain is snow-capped. The In
dians in the neighborhood have always
been in great fear of Mount Tanquitz, as
they, as well as hunters who have been in
the vicinity, have heard rumblings and
subterranean noises from the mountain,
and it has long been regarded as an ex
tinct vofcano.
SAN BENITO COUNTY ROW
Treasurer Montgomery Resigns
and Is Succeeded by T.
W. Hawkins.
The Grand Jury Will Now Look Up
the Records of Other Public
Officials.
HOLLISTER, Cal., Feb. 4.â At an ex
citing session of the county Board of
Supervisors to-day E. B. Montgomery ten
dered his resignation as Treasurer. Imme
diately about one-third of the local popu
lation entered the race for the position,
but the choice finally fell upon T. AY.
Hawkins, cashier of the Bank of Hollister,
who has been in charge of the office since
Montgomery's deficiency was discovered.
The bilJ of Rody Shaw for experting the
books of county officers at the request of
the Grand Jury was rejected. A subpena
was issued for Postmaster John Patterson,
a former expert, to explain how he came to
pass Qver a portion of the deficiency in the
Treasurer's office. The postmaster de
clined to obey the subpena on the ground
that it would take him several days to pre
pare a statement, and because he would
have to make his statement to the Grand
Jury.
The report of Expert Shaw was exceed
ingly severe upon the Supervisors, and
was by them suppressed.
Superior Judge Breen is not upon speak
ing terms with the rest of the county offi
cers, and is looking up . several records.
The Grand Jury will convene on Monday,
and it is highly probabfe that the family
row now in progress will result in startling
disclosures.

FRESNO, Cal., Feb." 4.â The raisin and

day riled a petition in insolvency, with
liabilities amounting to $68,000 and assets
to $64,000. WY^^fi&m'w^^^^i
This is one of the oldest frnit-packing
firms in Fresno. The principal reason for
the failure was the 'guaranteeing of prices
of raisins to the grower with the belief (
that prices would remain above a certain
. point; but tho quotations did not hold up :
as was expected. Tbis company: packed
more than 2,000,000 pounds of raisins this
year. Many thousands of dollars are still
uue to the growers in -. all parts of the
county, mostly in sums of less than $500. J --.

Sheriff Jtineur and Kx-Ueputy Bartholo-
SPOKANE, Wash., Feb. 4.-What came
near being a serious encounter too* place
to-day in the corridor of the courthouse
between Sheriff Rinear and lately dis
cliarged Deputy Bartholomew. Yesterday
tney came together and indulged in not
words, and to-day a fight would have re
sulted but for the interference of by
standers. The ex-deputy accused the
Sheriff of all kinds of mean things and
the Sheriff replied in equally strone terms.
The quarrel is the outcome of the dis
charge of Bartholomew a short time ago
on the charge that he was about to assist
in a jail delivery. Sunday night the
Sheriff, in the hope of entrapping him,
had one of the prisoners, C. S. Gifford,
write a lette.r to the ex-deputy asking that
he assist Gifford in escaping, and promis
ing to pay him well for the trouble.' The
letter was sent to Bartholomew's house
late at night by Sadie Smith, a com
panion of Gifford, and also a prisoner.
The wily ex-deputy did not bite, but, on
the contrary, learned from the girl the
whole scheme. The Sheriff, when charged
with it the next day, did not deny that he
was the author of the job.

Students Hope for an Early Decision in
thr Suit Against Their Patroness.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Feb.
4.â The fact that no decision in the Stan
ford suit has been handed down by the Su
preme Court is a grievous disappointment
to students and faculty alike. After the
news from Washington on Sunday the ma
jority of the students expected to imme
diately see a favorable outcome of the long
litigation. The feeling has grown and
continues to increase that the ultimate
holding of the court will be in favor of the
estate. Had the decision been favorably
rendered the student celebration would
have thrown into insignificance that which
took place last year when Judge Ross'
opinion was sustained. So. whiie no one
here doubts what the final result will be,
there is a feeling of depression that anoth
er month must pass before the momentous
question is settled.
On Wednesday afternoon the Carnot de
baters of Stanford will be assigned their
places in the intercollegiate contest and
will have torty-eight hours to prepare for
the test. This" is twenty-four hours more
than was given the debaters last ye^ir.
The baseball men to the number of fif
teen turned out for practice last even
ing. Fully twice that number will be
at work before the week is ended. On the
track eighteen men have already gone into
training. ____________

Superintendent of Schools Kirk
Pummeled by an Angry
Citizen.
Accused of Having Gashed a Little
Girl's Forehead With a Blow
From a Ferrule.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal.. Feb. 4.-
City Superintendent of Schools Kirk re
ceived a drubbing this afternoon at the
hands of J. D. Cochrane, a leading citizen
of this place. â  On Monday Prfoessor Kirk
was chastising Mr. Cochrane's little boy,
when the lad's sister interceded and
begged the professor not to whip her
brother so severely. The prof' instead
of listening to her entreaties, is said to
have crabbed her by the arm, jerked her
from her seat and struck at her with a
ruler he had in his hand. The blow landed
on her forehead, cuttine quite a gash above
the eye.
Cochrane this morning started out after
Professor Kirk with a pistol, but friends
intervened and persuaded him to give up
the weapon. This afternoon he met Kirk
on the street and a light ensued, in which
Cochrane struck Kirk several times be
fore they were separatad.

Town Trustees jfitieerlesa to Close a Dis-
orderly Saloon.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 4.â A curious com
plication has arisen here over the liquor
license ordinances, the outcome of which
no one can foresee. The liquor license
committee of the Town Trustees recently
investigated the manner of conducting a
saloon by one "Doc" Edwards in the Latin
quarter.
At a meeting of the Trustees last evening
the committee recommended that Ed
wards' license be revoked, on account of
disorder and the fact that the place was
frequented by women and boys.
When the report of the committee was
read Edwards' lawyer warned the Trustees
that they had no right to revoke the
license to his client and order the place
closed, on the ground that the amended
ordinance which provided for such pro
ceedings had been repealed prior to its
amendment.
City Attorney Moultrie. concurred in this
view. Despite these expressions, the Trus
tees passed a resolution revoking the
license and ordering Marshal Woy to close
Edwards' place at once. The Marshal has
been looking into the matter to-day, but
has taken no action. Lawyers generally
agree that Edwards cannot be compelled
to close his place, nor is he, so they say,
liable on his bond.

SANTA ROSA
Colonel Hardin's Daughter
Runs Away With a
Druggist.
HER PARENTS BAFFLED.
An Angry Brother's Attempt to
Check the Couple Is Made
Too Late.
WEDDED IN SAN FEANCISCO.
They Announce the Fact in a Tele
gram and Then Depart for
the East.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. 4.-^1 iss Ethel
Hardin, youngest daughter of Colonel J.
C. Hardin, a wealthy cattle-grower, was a
passenger on the 3:30 o'clock train for
San Francisco to-day. Chester B. Pooler,
formerly of this city but of late years a
resident of Seattle, was a passenger upon
the same train, and on that incident rests
an interesting story.
Not many years ago Miss Ethel and
"Chet" Pooler were schoolmates at the
Pacific Methodist College. It was at,
this institution that these two young peo
ple learned, in additiou to the usual
branches taught, that "the course of true
love runs smoothly." At the numerous
church socials and parties attended by the
two while at school and afterward. Miss
Ethel's mother was always present,
and the young man soon began to realize
that the daughter of the wealthy cattle
man was not for the poor drug clerk, if
parental authority was to be observed.
It was about at this time that a lovers'
quarrel was supposed to have been the
cause of Mr. Pooler's hasty departure for
â¢San Francisco. There he worked in var
ious drughouses until the means for a
university course could be saved from his
salary, and after- graduating: from the
School of Pharmacy he secured a position
in Seattle. During the time of the young
man's absence, Miss Hardin Jived at the
beautiful home of her father, devoting
most of her time to the study of music.
Vainly the young men of Santa Rosa paid
court to the studious heiress; vainly did
several match-making mothers attempt to
smooth the matrimonial way for bashful
sons. All were welcomed at the Hardin
mansion, but no favors were shown. At
length most of the suitors got disheartened
and dropped out of the race for beauty and
wealth, and tlie contest seemed to be
between two well-known young gentlemen
of the town. Many were the surmises of.
the gossiping class as to which of these
would be accepted.
Meanwhile the former drug clerk, now
manager of the American Drug Company
of Seattle, was carefully laying his plans.
A. letter to the atiil faithful Ethel, in
forming her that he had been appointed to
a position in St. Louis and that he would
expect her to be ready to accompany him,
brought a favorable answer and "Ohet"
was soon in Santa Rosa shaking hands
with his many friends here. Suugly re
posing in an inside pocket was a marriage
license procured by the thougtitful young
gentleman in San Francisco, and a friend
in that city had agreed to meet him with
a minister at Tiburon on the required day.
To-day Mr. Pooler bade good-by to
ttlose whom he met upon the street and
proceeded to the depot at 10 o'clock.
There, it appears, he was joined by Miss
Hardin and the couple were seen Beating
themselves together as the train moved
out from the depot.
A. Riley Hardin, a brother of the fleeing
cirl, was informed of this circumstance,
and the wires were hot with messages of
pleading and threats. To one friend the
young man wired to stop the couple
"peaceably or by force," and to spare no
expense. To the prospective bride the
promise of the paternal blessing and a
brilliant wedding at home was wired, to
which an answer was received at 7:30 p. m. :
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Feb. 4.â Are married

REPUBLICANS OF OREGON
Silver Discussion Prevented at
the Convention of State Club
Delegates.
Carey of Multnomah County Elected
President by an Overwhelming
Majority.
PORTLAND, Or.. Feb. 4.â The State
Convention of Republican clubs was held |
at Park Theater to-day. There were 1147 !
delegates in all, but only about two-thirds i
were present. The convention was one of
the most enthusiastic and undoubtedly
the most harmonious ever held in the
State. There were no serious disputes on
any questions that were brought up, ex
cept on that of charging future delegates
fees, which was finally compromised.
It had been expected that there would
be a split, on the silver question, but it was
averted by the committee on order of busi
ness. After reciting the usual order of
business, the committee tacked on a state
ment that no question or party principles
or opinions of any party leader should be
introduced or considered. The silver senti
ment in the convention was strong, but
having ao shrewd leaders the delegates did
not comprehend the move, and the report
of the committee was adopted as a whole.
There were only two nominations. for
the next president of the leagueâ John C.
Lea? ure of Umatilla County and Judge
Charles H. Carey of Multnomah. Carey
was elected by a larce majority, the vote
being 830 to 240. Carey has been asso
ciated with the younger Republicans as
against the "machine." and his position
on the silver question is unknown, so it
had no influence in the election.
Fourteen A- legates to the National Con
vention of Republican Clubs, to be held at
Milwaukee, were elected as follows: At
largeâ M. C. George, Multnomah County;
James A. Fee,' TJmatilla; T. A. McÃride.
Ciackamas; G. W. Patterson. Washing
ton; J. M. Long. Multnomah; and
A. W. Gowan, Harney. First Con
gressional District âJ. L. Patterson,
Marion; R. A. Booth, Josephine;
J. H. Hawley, Polk, and J. E. Blundell,
Douglas. Second District, including Port
landâJ. M. Church, Union; John Michell,
Wasco; F.J.Taylor, Clatsop, and W. C.
Avery, Multnomah.
There was no contest over delegates.
Tickets which were printed and arranged
in advance were elected without even o-p
--posing nominations.
VALZBJO MURDERER'S FATE.
ffilliatn Sta7tton to Spend Twenty-Five
years in San Queniin.
SUISDN, Cal., Feb. 4.â William J.
Stanton was brought before Judge Buckles
in the Superior Court of Solano County
last week on thecharEe of having shot and
killed Medora H. Keach in Vallejo iast
December. He was found guilty of mur
der in the second degree. This morning
the prisoner was sentenced to twenty-five
years' imprisonment in San Quentin.
Judge Buckles said the jurors evidently
did not believe in the insanity plea,
which the prisoner's attorneys urged in
his defense. They came to the conclusion
that the man had, while in a desperate
state of mind, disappointed in not ODtain
ing his discharge from the marine service
and fearing his marriage with the unfor
tunate woman would cause comment,
committed the crime. Stanton was taken
to San Quentin this evening by Deputy
Sheriff Donaldson.

Congress.
STRIKE AT THE OCTOPUS.
An Answer to the Insolent As
sertion That Only "Sand
lotters" Are Opposed.
i
DENUNCIATION OF TRAITOKS.
Southern Pacific Hirelings Are Flayed
and the People's Champions
Applauded.
CHICO, Cal., Feb. 4.â Chico to-day
struck (J. P. Huntington a blow full in tbe
face in return for his insolent assertion
that "none but sandlotters oppose the
funding bill." Notwithstanding the her
culean efforts of the paid emissaries of
the octopus lit prevent the attendance of
business men, by cajolery, promises and
threats, the town hall was filled to-night
by a large and enthusiastic audience of
representative citizens to protest against
the passage of a measure that will put a
chattel mortgage upon the productive in
terests of this section for the next fifty
years.
R. R. Fimple, one of the oldest and
most prominent farmers in this vicinity,
called the meeting to order, and General
John BidweU and Hon. Allen Henry were
chosen, respectively, president and secre
tary. The list of vice-presidents embraced
a large number of men prominent in pro
fessional and business circles.
After the applause which greeted Gen
eral BLdwell's taking the chair had sub
sided the "old pioneer of '42" proceeded to
arraign the railroad for the arbitrary, in
solent; and corrupt methods which had
ever characterized its conduct. Being one
of the largest shippers in the State, each
verbal blow fell with tellins effect and was
received by tumultuous applause. At the
conclusion of the general's address the fol
lowing resolutions were presented and
adopted by a rising vote. *
Whereas, The industrial and nroducing
classes of this State are now engaged in a death
struggle with a gigantic railroad monopoly in
an effort to break the chains that have bound
them for a quarter of a century, and whereas,
the passage of a railroad funding bill by Con
gress will but more firmly rivet the bonds upon
an impoverished and almost helpless people;
therefore* be it
Resolved, That the people of Chico arid vi
cinity, ip mass-meeting assembled, do most
earnestly and unanimously protest against the
passage of any funding bill or any measure of
similar character which will enable the South
ern Pacific Railroad Company to evade the
settlement of its just debts, by imposing upon
the people ot California the burden of their
payment;
That the present is, in all human probabil
ity, the last opportunity the people of this
State will have to free themselves from the
bondage of this gigantic monopoly, which novr
threatens to take possession of the very Gov
ernment itself, and make of us its servile vas
sals for all time ;
That the enormous and ill-gotten gains
realized from the construction and operation
of the railroad, which have been diverted from
their proper channels into the pockets of
Huntington and his fellow-conspirators, to
gether with the present assets of the company,
are vastly more than sufficient to cancel the
claims of the Government, and we demand
that foreclosure be made upon them, and not
upon the properties ot the oppressed and
plundered people of this State ;
That we note with pride the manly and hon
est stand taken by Senators Perkins and White
and a majority of our Congressional delega
tion Against the passage of the iniquitous and
infamous funding bill;
That to Mayor Sutro and the Committee of
Fifty of San Francisco we are deeply indebted
for their determined opposition to an insolent,
corrupt corporation and its superserviceable
tools;
That to the San Francisco Call and the San
Francisco Examiner and all other loyal news
papers which, in the interests of the people,
are waging relentless war against an arrogant
and unscrupulous enemy of the State we ex
tend the right hand of fellowship and bid
them God speed in their noble work;
That Hon. John C. Gray,' Superior Judge of
Butte County, voiced the sentiment of this
county when he said: "The pocket of every
open friend of the railroad funding bill con
tains a railroad pass";
That words fail us to express our condemna
tion and detestation of any newspaper which
either ignorantly or for corporate hire at
tempts to place this community in a false po
sition upon the subject of the railroad funding
bill;
That a copy ol these resolutions be forwarded
to the California delegation in Congress.
The resolutions were adopted amid great
applause and the meeting adjourned with
cheers for The Call, Senators Perkins and
White, Mayor Sutro and General Bidweli.

LGS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 4.âEncar

a little over a quarter of a century ago.
At that time he had an ' estate worth

Of the original estate there remained
just 42 cents. Nobody could be found to
claim it and the Public Administrator aid
not know what to do with it. . The sum
was not a large one, still it had to go
Bomewhere, bo Judge Clark made an order
directing Mr. Kelsey to pay the 42 cents
into the county treasury. This Mr. Kel

Guardian Taylor's Accounts Investigated
by the Court.
LOS ANGELES, CaiÂ», Feb. 4.â ln the
matter of the guardianship of Annie E.
Taylor Superior Judge Clark to-day made
an order striking out items amounting to
$tMO in tne account of Guardian Taylor.
This was a case in which the guardian
failed to give the court an accounting of
his trust for some time, and was finally
ordered to do so. He then put in an ac
count which showed, on its face that his
ward was indebted to him about $290.
After Judge Claru had trimmed down the
account it showed that Guardian Taylor
owed his ward about $400. This Guardian
Taylor will have to pay, or his bondsmen
will be sued.

GUILTY OF GROSSEST FRAUDS.
Officials of a Corporation Scored by a De
cision in the Maryland Court
of Appeals.
BALTIMORE, Md., Feb. 4.-A sensation
was caused in financial circles to-day by
the opinion of the Maryland Court of Ap
pals at Annapolis in the case of Amy Dn
puy and Herbert Dupuy, her husband, of
Pittsburg, Pa., against the Transportation
and Terminal Company of Baltimore. The
case came from the Circuit Court of Balti
more.
"The matter involved was a bill for a re
ceiver for the Transportation and Ter
minal Company of Baltimore City, a de
funct corporation that had already passed
through insolvency with Winfield J. Tay
lor, a well-known lawyer in Baltimore, as
trustee.
Mr. and Mrs. Dupuy had invested $60,000
in this enterprise, which at the time pur
ported to Have the control of the Maryland
Central Kailroad, the York and Peach
Bottom Railroad, some extensive coal
lands and a large part of the contract for
the building of the belt railroad.
It is said that the total amount of
claims similar to Mrs. Dupuy's exceeds
$1,500,000, a large number of Pittsburg
people having been induced to invest.
The president of the cempanv was Wil
liam Gilmer, who has been for many years
one of the best-known railroad men in
Baltimore.
The chief promoter of ' the Terminal
Company was John Henry Miller of Balti
more.
The Court of Appeals finds that these
two gentlemen have been guilty of the
grossest frauds, not only in their transac
tions with Mr. and Mrs. Dupuy, but in the
wnole conduct of the business of the Term
inal Company.
WITHDRAWAL OF HARRISON.
It Is . Believed That the Strength of the
Indiana Delegation Will Be
â  . Divided.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 4.â Leading
Republicans of the House who were spoken
to to-day do not as a rule feel that General
Harrison's withdrawal from the Presi
dential race will materially affect the pros
pects of the other candidates. The Ohio
Representatives, of course, believe that
McKinley will secure the support i of the
Indiana delegation.
This opinion is shared by Representa
tives from other States. Other gentlemen
believe that the Indiana delegation will
divide its strength among the various. can
didates. The Indiana Republicansâ if
the members of Congress from that State
fairly reflect the sentiments of their con-
stituentsâ while believing General Har
rison to be sincere, indulee the hope that
an exigency may arise which may require
the convention to nominate him.
Many Senators declined to-day to dis
;uss the effect of the withdrawal of ex-
President Harrison from the list of Presi
dential candidates, but the champions of
other candidates on the floor of the Senate
were evidently pleased at the action of Mr.
Harrison.
NEW YORK, N.Y., Feb. 4.-The Mail
and Express this afternoon printed the
following: Senator John M. Thurston of
Nebraska, who was among to-day's ar
rivals at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, ex
pressed considerable surprise at General
Harrison's letter forbidding the use of his
name before the St. Louis convention.
"There can be no doubt of the General's
earnestness, however," eaid the Senator.
"He is a perfectly sincere man, and those
who know him best will understand that
he means just what he says. He is out of
the field, and no man who values 'his'Kood
will should attempt to drag him in again.
General Harrison's withdrawal will make
no change in the political situation in Ne
braska."

PLANNING FOE THE FUTTTEE.
Uniform Rank Expected to Parade on
the Knights of Pythias
Day.
TRUCKEE, Cai,., Feb. 4.â To-night's
train from the west brought several visi
tors to the carnival, and each succeeding
day brings its quota of sight-seers. Spray
ing was kept up all of last night and sev
eral inches of ice was added to the walls of
the palace. An improvement m the
palace which means the outlay of consid
erable money was commenced to-day. It
is the replacing of the rough pine boards
which form the inside wall of the skating
rink with dressed lumber. This will be
painted in carnival colors and will add
greatly to the appearance of the interior
of the palace.
Crowds are sliding the toboggan to-night
and all pronounce it in capital condition.
From, present indications it will be hard
for Truckeeites to part with the slide after
winter is over, as they never seem to tire
of this sport. The skating is good and all
the nearby ponds are covered with a thick
coating of ice. People take advantage of
this, and skating parties are quite the
thing.
Posters announcing the excursions to
take place on Saturday and Sunday are
out and parties are expected from San
Jose, San Francisco, Stockton, Sacramento
and all the cities along the line of the rail
road. ' .
A letter to-day informed the manage
ment of the intention of the Knights of
Pythias grand officers to be present, and
as Saturday will be their day there will
probably be a grand parade of the Uniform
Rank. C. F. McGlashan, colonel of this
division, has mapped out an extensive
programme for the entertainment of the
visitors, and it will bo' carried out on a
magnificent scale.
The weather is clear and cold to-night
and it is favorable to the success of the
carnival.

CHICAGO, 111., v Feb. 4. â Student
anarchy broke out in Lake Forest Academy;
yesterday morninp, resulting in an exodus
of the boys for their homes. ; Tnirty came
into Chicago on a night train, thirty, more
packed their trunks to follow this : morn
ing, and of the thirty remaining it is said
at least half will go home when they get
money for car fare.
It is a case of disciplining the faculty,
the boys say, ' for refusing to reinstate
three" suspended students. The three
s-tudents were expelled for insubordination,
caused by the faculty disciplining them.
â¢ A pillow fight was followed by a cat-call
party in the room of ' George Burchell.
Professor â â  William F. ; Brewer, who is
hardly older than ' the students, tried to
restore order. The boys then locked him
out, blew out: the lights and the noise
increased. When he learned the names of
the dozen boys in the room, Professor
Brewer gavo demerits to Kusfield and
Casey. -They were also forbidden to go to
church on Sunday night* which is account
ed a grievous punishment by the students
of .that Presbyterian settlement. They
protested, \ and \ along with Burchell the
host of the noise-makers were pronounced
guilty of insubordination and were sus
pended. â¢ .: - . : : '
"Saturday night's conduct was the

JURH. DOUD WAS JEALOUS.
That la Why She Fired a Shot at Lillian
Stcnyne.
NEW YORK, N. V. ( Feb. 4.-At 7:45
o'clock last night Harriet Doud called at
the stage entrance of Daly's Theater and
asked for Lillian Swayne, who is employed
by Mr. Daly as a soubrctte. Miss Swayne
responded, and immediately on her
making her appearance Mrs. Doud drew a
revolver and discharged it at Miss Swayne
but fortunately the bullet went wide of
the mark.
Special Patrolman Hanley, who was in
the vicinity at the time, ran up to where
the shot was fired and arrested Mrs. Doiid
and her husband, who were standing on
the steps of the stage entrance. He took
them to the- police station, and on being
searched a, 3S-caliber revolver, one cham
ber empty, was found on Mrs. Doud.
Miss Swayne's father, Professor Swayne
when asked about the cause of the shoot

TO ADVANCE CHURCH MUSIC.
Attempt* Will Be Made to Form an Or
ganization of Organlstt.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. i.â Forty
prominent organists of this city and
Brooklyn met last evening In the South
Church to consider the advisability of
forming an American guild of organists.
The Rev. Dr. Roderick Terry presided.
After a discussion it was decided to have*
another meeting on Fe bruary 15.
The idea of the guild is to advance the
cause of church music, to elevate the
status of church organists, to obtain ac
knowledgment ot their position from the
authorities of the church and to increase
the responsibilities and duties of the or
ganists. The membership Is to be limited
to patrons, founders, fellows, associates
and annual subscribers.
A large committee, of representative
organists will endeavor to secure the co
operation of the foremost organists in the
country.

DORRE IN "CARMEN."
Blzet'a Charming Work Crowds the
Baldwin Theater.
There was a big audience at the Baldwin
Theater to greet "Carmen" last night.
The opera may be said to have made a ais
tinctly good impression.
Thea Dorre is on her native heath, so to
speak, as Carmen. Vocally and histrion
ically she shows herself to be an artist all
through the work, though she rises to her
grandest height in the card scene, where
her terror and superstitious foreboding are
repressed with wonderful art, both in
voice and gesture. Her singing of "Thou
Lov'st Me Not," earlier in the work, was
also marked by remarkable witchery and
sweetness. Needless to say Dorre won
much applause.
Payne Clark showed to much better ad â¢
vantage as Don Jose than he had done the
previous night in "Aida." He acted with
considerable passion and brutality and
his singing won him several well-deserved
recalls.
Anna Lichter sang and acted charm
ingly as Michaela. Max Eugene was a fairly
good Escamilio and- the rest of the caste
was satisfactory. The orchestra was heard
to better advantage than on Monday,
though the introduction was not always
above reproach. The absence of Signbr
Morreale. who conducted -bo sympathetic
ally last year, is distinctly perceptible.

GAVIN McNAB ON
CHRIS BUCKLEY.
Mr. Sam Rainey Has Also
Come in for Criti
cism.
THE JUNTA IS DEFINED.
A Budget of Some Interesting
and Timely Political
Epigrams.
SAM AND CHRIS ABE DOOMED.
It Is Said That the Fire Department
Is Kept Very Busy Escaping
From Politics.
The exact position of the Junta in
municipal politics has been clearly set
forth by Gavin McNab.
When the Junta was organized by the
Democracy it was heralded to the com
munity at large that one Christopher
Buckley and another Sam Rainey, who
had a hankering after fire apparatus,
plugs, etc., would be smitten upon their
political hearts until they went down in
the contest waged against them.
One of the foremost men in this fight
"against corruption, ballot-stuffing, corpo
ration control, Buckley phobia and Rainey
rahies was, and is to-day, Gavin McNab,
whose tongue and arm have been lifted
again and again against the influence and
prestige of these two bosses.
Last night Mr. McNab, after due thought
and care in the use of words, gave up. the
following, which appears to be a clear and
concise answer to most of the questions
that are likely to be asked regarding the
intention of the Junta as regards Sam and
Chris:
"There Is no change," said he, "in what
is termed the Junta toward Buckley or-
Rainey. We are opposed to both or either.
There is but one thing that is worse than
Buckleyism and that is Buckleyism and
Rain,eyism. There are worse people
than Raineyâ Buckley and Rainey
for instance. . Those people who
have refused to believe that we
v.ere sincere in our professed attitude to
ward Buckley arid Rainey were mistaken.
The organization presided over by Colonel
W. P. bullivan has been just as deter
mined to resist interference on the part of
Rainey as on the part of Buckley. A
domination of Rainey would be an evil
less in quantity hut not differing in qual
ity from a domination of Buckley.
"It is true that our organization has had
friendship, sympathy and tacit support
from friends of the Fire Department, It
also true that Rainey has always been con
sidered potential in the affairs of that in
stitution, but Chairman Sullivan has made
the Fire Department one of the brightest
and best-administered features of our
municipal government. He declares that
his only desire is to Lave the Fire Depart
ment left alone.
"If I may use a paradox, as we under
stand the Fire Department's position, its
only participation in politics is to prevent
itself being dragged into politics. That is
clear enough to accommodate all the
friends of good government and good citi
zenship generally, and we have accepted
Sullivan's statement as defining the posi
tion of the Fire Department, and our or
ganization expects the department and its
friends to live up to their promises.
"I am only one among many in the or
ganization and can only speak from views
of leaders as I have heard them expressed.
On one point, however, I can speak as an
individual. I, more largely than any
other person, have been in communication
with members of the State committee
throughout the State. They are nearly all
friends of mine. These men are unani
mously against Buckleyism in any shape
or form and also against Raineyism.
"I have assured these men that when
our organization comes before them and
asks for recognition it would come before
that body with clean hands, not asking
the committee to choose between Buck
leyism and Raineyism in any form,. but
offer our organization composed of men
plighted to honest government and de
cency and opposed to all forms of bossism.
I am assurred by members of the State
committee with whom I have conversed
that an organization partaking of the
character that these men have shown
would not be recognized at all."
"Han not Rainey many friends in the
Junta?" was asked of Mr. McNnb.
"Well, yes, perhaps 10 per cent of them
are Rainey's friends, but they will be lost
in the rank and file of the organization.
.That is bound to occur in all new move
ments. It is a safe thing to say, though,
of the Buckley organization that ten
tentha of them are Buckleyites.
."There is one {hing in relation to the
Junta that I want to call attention to, and
that is that none of the members of it are
office seekers or candidates for oilice. If
they win their only satisfaction will be in
knowing that they have done good work
in the matter of bringing about a good
government.
"The real enemy of good government is
the conservative citizen. If he be rich he
prefers a doss, because wealthy men have
many interests of such character that they
profit out of public disadvantage.
"In a few words a boss is the bridge
over which the aristocratic evil-doer can
reach and traffic with the criminal."
MARSHALL, THE FAMOUS
The Crack Pistol Shot Who
Keeps the Peace in Cripple
Creek.
Gold Is in Plenty, but the Residents
Pay Big Prices for Chairs in
Which to Sleep.
Cripple Creek, the new and presumably
rich diggings in Colorado, toward which
the eyes of the mining world have been
focused for some months, does not yield
very much news as a rule. It would ap
pear that those who venture themselves
into the new El Dorado either forget their
friends or else are too busy to inform, them
as to the general makeup of their new
home. At all events, letters from there
are scarce, and Tiie Call is pleased to be
able to produce a newsy one fresh from the
mining district, sent by William L. Ken
nedy, one of the best known characters in
this City and State. He writes as follows:
Cripple Creek, Colo., Jan. 30, 1890.
From 9000 feet above sea level [ send you
greeting. In the greatest gold-mining camp
on earth I am satisfactorily located, with the
brightest possible prospects for money-making.
Imagine a town, or rather a city, of 20,000
persons, with a surrounding territory contain
ing some 30,000 more, and then you can form
some idea of the great crowds of people who
push their way along the narrow sidewalks of
the few short streets which, help form tho city
of Cripple Greek.
The name of the town was gained by an ac
cident which happehed a cowboy ft few years
ago while herding cattle. His bronco threw
him into a gully and a broken leg resulted.
Owinfr to the absence of skilled doctors the
cowboy became a cripple.
Although buildings spring up as by magic,
they are not built fast enough to accommodate .
tho rapidly increasing population. Many of
the new arrivals. are unable to secure lodgings,
and it is a common sight to see men lying
asleep on barroom floors. The hotels have
signs posted up which read as follows: "Per
sons who desire to sleep in chairs will apply to
the porterâ charges, 50 cents."
Eating is comparatively cheap, while a room
6x9 rents.fors7per week. Water sells at 25
cents per barrel, and wood, which is the prin
cipal fuel, costs 'Z5 cents an armful. I could
not refrain from telling the old chap who
brought- tne last armful that I'd sooner have
his "graft" than a license to steal. He only
grinned in response. The saloons run all
night, and gambling runs in every saloon.
There is no great mystery in the geology of
Cripple Creek, but it is a surprise that so many
true fissure veins exist and that nature has
been so lavish in the deposition of rich ore.
Each new vein now discovered means im
mediate wealth for the owner. There are
many streaks of ore found which run over a
hundred thousand dollars to the ton.
The miners of this district are a hardy class,
who give no thought to the future. As soon as
payday arrives they hurry to town in order to
nave what they .call a "good time"â a grand
old drunk. On such occasions the nights are
made hideous by drunken laughter and
maudlin songs. The squeaky violin gets in its
work, accompanied by the equally squeaky
voice of the ever-present concert-hall siren.
Ana one is lulled to sleep by the tune of "And
the Band Played On," which comes floating
through the air from some adjacent "free and
easy." "Yet with all the bad whisky, bad
women nnd worse men, there are few fights
and no murders. There is a good reason for
this quiet state of affairs.
The notorious Jim Marshall, who is credited
with being the most expert pistol shot in the
West, is the Town Marshal, and the hard char
acters who infest every mining camp had
sooner face his satantc rnajestv than look into
the cold gray eyes of Jim Marshall. He rules
the camp with an iron hand. A person found
with a revolver on him is heavily fined, and it
is doubtful if a miner in the entire district car
ries one.
The city of Victor, four miles distant, where
the famous Independence and Portland mines
are located, is quite the reverse as regards law
and order. Murders are frequent, while savage
fights are of daily oaeurence.
Inclosing I might add that Cripple Creek
hns its Press Clubâ about forty-eight members.
All the Denver pacers have representatives
here, as have also many of the lareje Eastern
papers. W. L. Kennedy.
WATER OF CASTRO LAKE
J. S. Hansborough and Others
Want to Lay Pipes Through
the City.
The Purpose Is to Supply the Public
With 24,000,000 Gallons of
Water Daily.
James A. Johnson, an attorney repre
senting J. S. Hansborough and others,
sent in a petition to the Board of Super
visors yesterday to be permitted to lay
mains and pipes through the streets of
San Francisco for the purpose of supply
ing the City with water from Tembladera
Creek, the outlet of the Castro lakes, near
Monterey.
Mr. Hansborough recently took up water
rig-tita on the creek to . the exient of 5000
inches. The plan is to bring the water to
San Francisco through San Jose, supply
ing that city and residents along the line
with the pure water of the southern reser
voir.
It is proposed to utilize a 60-inch iron
pipe for the purpose, pumping water
with sufficient force to carry it to a desti
nation ar.d still leave a pressure of eighty
pounds to the square inch at S^n Francisco.
The intention is to follow the line of the
Monterey division of the Southern Pa
cific Company as closely as possible. Mr.
Johnson's letter to the Board of Supervi
sors is as follows:
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors-r-Gzx
tle>ikx: Having recently taken up and lo
cated lor myself and associates, under the
statutes and laws of the State of California,
the water of the Tembladera, the same being
the outflow of the Castro lakes, near Castro
ville, Monterey County, Cal., and believing
that we can supply this City with au abund
ance of pure, fresh water for every purpose de
sired, we submit the same for your considera
tion, hereby agreeing to abide by any reason
able conditions you may impose.
That is, if you will grant us the power and
authority to lay down mains ana pipes through
the streets of the City, we will supply
city and the - puplic with 24.000,000
gallons of pure, iresh water per day. Or,
if your honorable board should prefer, we will
sell the rights to the use of the said water for a
reasonable sum to the City. Respectfully,
James a. Johnson,
Attorney for Petitioner.

i CÂ»3 Howwd Street, Near airrtSx *HENDERSON'S NEW PLAN
Would Increase Normal School
Courses and Give Up Sub
stitutes.
THEY MUST FOKGET POLITICS.
He Believes His Plan Is Practical,
but the Members May Consider
It Utopian.
H. C. Henderson is one of the members
of the Board of Education who is an
ardent advocate of the reorganization of
the Normal School, although he is not nope
ful that it will be effected at an early date.
"No, I do not," was Mr. Henderson's
reply to the question, "Do you think the
Board of Education will reorganize the
Normal School?
"It is a shame that the girls and boys of
our Normal School can only have granted
to them by the county boards of education
primary grade certificates on their Normal
School diplomas, after spending three
years in our High School and one year in
the normal. If our educational lead
ers in this City had been wide-awake
men they would have kept ahead
of the State Normal schools and would
have given critics no chance to say our
Normal School course was too short. Here
is where the State Normal School has got
us. We waited until the State extended
the Normal School course to four years
and of course any person who is practical
must acknowledge that a four years'
course in a normal training school is su
perior to a three years' course in academic
education and one year in a Normal class
with no training. "Such is our situation
to-day. Can you t>lame the county boards
of education?
"I feel that it was a little premature to
take Bnap-judgment against our girls, as
they have, in not waiting until the State is
able to produce teachers who have taken
the four years' normal course. Ourgirlswho
have laken the normal course are certainly
equal to any the State turned out on their
three years' course, and they should be
treated so. It cost the State not.iing to
maintain our City Normal School, and
shall not cost them anything in the futnre
if I can get politics out of the heads of the
members of the Board of Education long
enough to consider a business proposition
for about fifteen minutes.
"I can snow the Siate Normal Schools
completely under as far as making com
petent teachers is concerned, -but to again
have the county boards recognize and
issue grammar-^rrade certificates on our
Normal School diplomas is another ques
tion. But as 1 said before, we can beat
the State Normal Schooi because we have
advantages that are not at the command
of the State and, further, we can spend at
least $16,400 per year on a Normal School
and not cost the taxpayer or increase the
expense of our School Department one
cent?"
"How can this be done?"
"In the lirst place we maintain a substi
tute class of thirty persons and pay them
$40 a month. This is $16,400 a year." '
He continued :
My plan is to organize a Normal Training
Sihooi, the Dumber of students to be when
tht_- school is in working order 160 pupils, to
be admitted as follows: Forty at the com
mencement, July, 1896, to be taught for the
first six months by the principal who is
selected to take charge of the school. At the
â¢Ist of Januiry, 1897, forty more, and in July,
1*97, forty more, and at the Ist of January,
1-9-*, forty more; this will make a two years'
course. Then the forty who came in in" July,
IBi*>,,willgo into the schools as a regular
substitute class and take the places of the
substitutes that we are paying $40 per month,
and at the close of the six months' substitut
ing, which completes the two-year course, the
places that are vacant in the primary and
grammar grades should be filled by electing
the substitutes thus filling tne places as pro
bationary teachers for two years thereafter if
satisfactory as permanent teachers.
Will pupils enter on such terms?
Yefc \\ hen we asked for quantity teachers
came to us by the thousands. Now, if we ask
for quality they will come to us in the same
ratio. Let us compare the cost of sending a
girl or boy to the Slate Normal School, which
is a four years' course, with our City normal
training school (if we get one), with a rive
year course. It will cost the citizens of San
Francisco to send a girl or boy to San Jose $20
per month, or $240 per year, or $960 for the
four years, and your child away from
home and in' whose company you know
not. Our citizens can support "their girls
and boys at home on $10 per month, besides
having their assistance night and morning,
and give them a three-year course in the High
School and two in the Normal Training School
for $120 per year, or $600 for the five years
Thus you see there is a saving of $360 m'favor
of having a home normal school. Besides, the
boys and girls we educate at home save the
Public School Department $240 in doing the
Eubstitute duty for six months, thus leaving
the school, if they do not get a permanent
position, under no obligations to the tax
payers of our City for their High and Normal
School education, for the $240 they earn in
doing substitute duty pays the entire expense
of the five years of tuition after they leave the
grammar school. This does away with the
cry, "Supporting a Normal School at the ex
pense of the primary and grammar schools,"
anl above and beyond this, it removes the
appointing df primary ani grammar school
teachers out of reach of tne politician, unless
we get a corrupt prinripal and superintendent.
The board will not reorganize the sshool?
That is my opinion. Because the resolution
was referred to the Classification Committee
and they recommended that nothing oe done
in the matter, and I had it referred back to the
committee of the whole for discussion and
nothing lias been done since.
You cannot get them to ac-vote time to edu
cational matters that should be given them.
Not but t.. at the members of the board mean
well, but they have Other business. It is as I
heard one of our teachers remark, that she
"never thought of the school from the time
they closed at 2:30 until she returned next
morning.'' Thi3 is perhaps the way with the
directors. They come to the meeting, $nd all
the thinking that is required is done while the
meeting proceeds.
WITH THE TRADES UNIONS
Preparing for the Big Labor Con
vention to Be Held Next
Week.
The Musicians' Union Wins a Victory.
Reorganizing the Ironmolders
of the Coast.
NÂ«ir!y every labor union in the Cily
wiil be represented at the Labor Unicn
Convention which will be held on the
evening of the 14th inst. at 1159 Mission
street The convention will be held under
the auspices of the Trades Council, and
the object is for the discussion of the con
dition of the laboring classes. In reality
it means a revival of trades unions and a
cincintrationof force? in onecentral body.
:e;eral years ago the Trades Council
had on its roll representatives of over
sixty unions, but the haru times came
along and the representation dwindled
down to fifteen or twenty. The Trades
Council recently saw the light of better
times approaching and decided to a<r"'' n
a ouse enthusiasm among the unions, and i
to this pnd called the i o.iveution.
Labt tuning at the meeting of t!;e
Ciyar-hi. kers' Union N. Blum, T. F. Hums,
K. Snvder and <j. C. Co pel ami were ap
pointed as delegates lo the labor cjnven
lion. Preparations we>-.- n ie tor tb"
election of the officers of the (Jigar-iuakert>*
International Union which will b- held on
the Bth iust. There are to hi elected a i
president, seven vice presidents and aj
treasurer. The balloting will be done by
the Australian system.
The Painters' and Decorators' Union
will send to the labor convention K. T.
I cI Â£ cr Â»', J^ W - Rose Â» AI - Falen, A. L. Cof
hn-F. M. Brown, Fred Brusse, C. L. Ames
and V. McAvoy. The painters recently,
in an open letter to the master painters,
set forth that they had determined to bet
ter their condition and were prepared to
begin a war upon all the bosses who stand
in the way of their doing so. They want
wages enough for a living and demand
eight hours as a day's work.
In the letter was an invitation to the
bosses to meet in conference upon the mat
ters under consideration. The master
painters at last decided to give the jour
neymen painters a hearing and the meet
ing will be held on Wednesday next. The
union anpointea as a committee to meet
the bosses Messrs; Mclver, Coffin, Brown,
Merrill and Hoffman.
Since the arrival of J. F. Valentine, first
vice-president of the Iron-molders' Inter
national Union of North America, he has
beer* very busy all along the coast reor
ganizing the union. The late Interna
tional Convention decided to make a
sick benefit for its members of $5
per week. It also made the dues 25 cents
per week in order that the union may be
able to meet the insurance benefit. Val
entine has been hard at work auditing
and arranging the books of the unions in
Los Angeles, Stockton, Sacramento, Port
land, Seattle, Tacoma, Vancouver and
Victoria. Now he is in this City fixing up
the books of the local union 164.
The Musicians' Union, aided by the
Trades Council, have won a victory "in the
tight with the proprietor of the People's
Palace on Eddy and Mason streets. For
the past month there had been a boycott
on the place because the proprietor had a
non-union band in the theater. Numer
ous attempts were made to induce him .to
hire union musicians, but to no purpose
until Monday night, when he was met by
a committee from the Trades Council.
The difficulty was settled by the non
union band being dismissed and a union
band hired in its stead.
BIG YEAR FOR BEETS
Richard Gird Says the Product
of Chino Will Be 100,000
Tods.
Over 9000 Acres Are Down in Beets
Thereâ The Tariff Bill and the
Industry.
Richard Gird, long known as the owner
of the famous Chino lanch, a principality
in itself, consisting of some 43,000 acres,
is at the Occidental.
Mr. Gird is also extensively interested
in the great sugar factory at the town of
ChinO. The factory has a capacity for
over 800 tons of beets a day.
"The indications are that this will be a
very prosperous year at Chino," said Mr.
Gird, "and that there will be a heavy crop
of sugar beets. There will be about 7000
acres produced on the ranch this year, and
the company expects there will probably
be about 2000 acres more on land around
there. This means from the vicinity of
Anaheim principally.
"The capacity of our works is 800 tons a
day, but we expect to enlarge it and make
it 1000 tons. We have procured a Stetten
plant, at a total cost of something near
$200,000. This plant is for the purpose of
petting the last sugar out of the molasses.
We also have an ice plant equal to sixty
tons of ice a day to cool the juices.
"I estimate that the total beet product
of Chino and vicinity ought to make this
year from 105,000 to 107,000 tonsâ say 100,
--000 anyway. Last year we worked 90,000
tons.
' As for our forces, we employ when work
ing at the full capacity about 300 men in
and around the factory. The farmers em
ploy many hundreds. I have little doubt
that this will be a good year.
"The weather has been very suitable
there for the development of the beet*. It
takes a dry climate properly for beets.
There is more sugar in them than when it
is wet."
Mr. Gird says the emergency tariff bill
proposed by Congress is not good for
people engaged in the beet industry. As
the bill exists it piaces substantially all
the tariff on lumber and mill, so that
there is little or no protection to the suger
growers.
As this is an industry of signal impor
tance to California, it would have been for
tunate for the State if the growing of beets
had been encouraged.
"I believe," said Mr. Gird, "that Cali
fornia is the place above all others in the
United States in which to grow beets.
They reach thÂ«ir highest perfection here.
The climate is admirably suited, and the
product is much heavier here than any
where else. With proper encouragement
the industry would become of enormous
importance."
Mr. Gird will be here for several days at
least. He says the whole of Southern Cali
fornia is enjoying increased prosperity.
He thinks this will be a good year there in
a financial way, and over California in
general.
PRESERVE CLUB BATTLE,
Sportsmen of Solano and Alameda
Counties Join the' Protective
Association.
The Sportsman's Protective Association
met last evening at the Knights of the
Red Branch Hall, and the secretary
read a. report from a prominent sports
man of Benicia, which stated that a
club of 100 members had been organized in
Solano County, the object of which was to
combat the further introduction of what
are commonly called duck-shooting pre
serve clubs in. that county, and to join
with the Sportsman's Association of this
City to further the interests of the sports
men at large.
A club of thirty members, which was re
cently organized in Alameda County, with
headquarters in Oakland, also asked for
membership in the association, and was
elected by a unanimous vote.
President Ahem said that he was greatly
please i to seethe association growing so
rapidly, and that numerically speakine it
had gained 500 new members since the
commencement of the .new year, which
signifies that the sportsmen begin to real
ize that in unity thereis strength.
"I desire that the sportsmen at large
will understand," said the president, "that
tins association has been organized pur
posely to oppose the aims of clubs the
objects of which are to deprive sportsmen
or a just right to shoot tfpon swamp lands,
whLeh are of no value other than the sport
which duck-shooters can enjoy by shooting
wild game.
"This association is strongly in favor of
protecting the interests of the farmer, and
any representative of this club who enters
upon the lands of a farmer and destroys
any property will be expelled from this
association when proof is shown of his
guilt."
A. Marston, Andrew O'sen, J. Jones and
H E. Niedt of Berkeley, have been en
joined from trespassing upon the swamp
and overflowed lands of Mrs. Tewksberry
of San Pablo. Those sportsmen have em
ployed Attorney W. S. Smith of Oakland
to defend them iv the Superior Court of
Solano County.
They will also be. defended by the attor
neys of the association. President Ahem,
Ilisgen, Battu Sweney and Snyder were
appointed a committee to look up suitable
grounds for a picnic and blue-rock Bdoot,
which will be lield nnder the auspices of
the association in the early part of the
summer. Schuetzen Park, near San Rafael,
was suggested as bejng the most available
place for an outing.
Ladies' stays are made to the value of
$2,uoo,ooo every year in Paris and $10,000,000
in France altogether.

[â¢Gold Cup s -:y '-i^-;
Bay District have been heard to remark
that they never encountered such hard
booking since they stood on the block.
The talent could rightly claim that they
have never struck such hard picking as the
winners of late have been, and yesterday
was no exception. Honest-going Braw
Scot captured the opening event, starting
a pronounced favorite, and imp. Fullerton
Lass, the lukewarm choice for the fifth
event, finished in front of her field, and
that was the extent of the moneyed
choice's successes.
The Westchester stable executed a very
clever coup in the fourth race, a short six
furlong dash. The stable had entered its
good three-year-old Gratify, with 88
pounds up. tmt for some reason the ring
and general betting public seemed to
think that little Reidy could not pilot him
successfully, and from 4 his odds wan
dered back in the betting to 12 to 1. Then
there was a rambling sort of a play on
him, the coin going in to the books in $10
and $20 bets, until the bookmen thought
it about time to rub, and he went to the
post at sixes. Yankee Doodle was a hot 6
to 5 favorite, with George Miller second in
demand. The Yankee horse cut out a hot
clfp to the stretch, closely attended by
George Miller. He then began to show
signs of tiring and a furlong from tbe wire
George Miller h assumed the lead. Lit
tle Reidy on Gratify, who had been run
ning a good third, now challenged the
Kansas City "Hindoo," and in a drive
beat him out a neck. The favorite fin
ished an indifferent third.
Barney Schrieber's Braw Scot carried
the bulk of the coin in the opening event,
a six-furlong selling affair, and taking the
lead turnine into the stretch, won with
little to spare by; two lengths. Pecksniff
got the place in a hard drive from Miss
Koss.
Nine "babies" went to the post in the
three and a half furlong spin. John Itob
bins' pair, the consistent Mary X and
Lindendale, opened 7 to 5 choices, but such
a plunge was made on the Nettie Beatrice
colt that they went back in the betting to
threes. The latter-named entry was backed
down from 6 to Itol4 to 5. There waa
also a stiff play on Gorgon. Lady Laurel
wood was in front until well on toward the
tape, when Mary X passed her and won by
three parts of a length. Early Notice, his
first time with the silk up, was a creditable
third.
The erratic Mt. McGregor II opened
favorite for the following event at five and
a half furlongs, but gave way to Coleman,
who closed a 9 to 5 choice. The latter
norse headed the bunch up to within a
sixteenth from home, where Alt. McGregor
caught him and in a hard drive won by a
head. Bello of Stonewall was a close up
third.
The fifth was a very good betting event.
Imp. Fullerton Lass and Seaside were
both held at 11 to 5,. with Hacienda and
McFarlane equally as well played at
longer odds. Securing a running start
McFarlane's colors showed prominently in
front until a sixteenth from the finishing
post, where Cochran apparently became
rattled as Fullerton Lass closed on him,
and in a bungling finish was beaten out a
scant two lengths by the favorite.
Thirteen started in the last race of the
day, a five and a half furlong scramble.
Getting wary of good things being cut
loose, quite a number of the bookmakers
laid only show odds. At post time,
Claude Hill at 11 to 5 was the most fancied,
with Marionette and Governor Budd the
next in demand. Edgemont, who had as
good as 40 to 1 chalked against his name,
outfooted the field in the stretch and won
by three lengths. Marionette was second,
a head before the favorite.
EACING AT TNGLESIDE.
The New Course Will Eeopen To-Morrow
With Ladies' Day the Attraction.
The racing will conclude to-day at the
Bay District and to-morrow Ingleside
track will reopen its gates for public pa
tronage. The management of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club has assurances from the
headquarters of the Market-street Rail
way system that they now have everything
in readiness to transport passengers on the
cars from the ferries through to Ingleside
track without transfer. Additional cars
will be run on the opening day for the
accommodation of ladies, the occasion also
being "Ladies' day."
The programme of running events is
sued for the first week's racing at the new
course appears to have impressed horse
owners very favorably, giving as it does
the selling plates as well as the members
of the stake division an opportunity of
winning some of the fat purses nung up.
During the past two weeks' racing at the
Bay District the inclemency of the weather
and the muddy condition of the track has
caused many owners of the better class of
horses to give their charges a rest. The
Ingleside course is dry and dusty at
present, and if the fine weather continue.*
race-goers will have an opportunity of
seeing some of the top-notchers meet in
record-smashing contests.
Entries for the first day's running events
will close at Ingleside and also at tne Bay
District track to-day at 3 o'clock.
Not ft Precedent to Be Followed.
The Washington correspondent of the
Atlanta Journal tells a story of a weil
known navai dignitary who has a beauti
ful daughter. A certain young ensign
with no resources but his slender salary
fell in love with her and asked the old
gentleman for her hand. The father at
once taxed him with the fact that he had
only his salaryâhardly enough to keep
him in white cloves and to burnish his
brass buttons. "Well, Mr. Admiral, what
you say is true, but when you were mar
ried you were only a midshipman with
even a smaller salary than mine. How
did you pet along?" asked ihe ensign, who
believed he had made the most diplomatic
of defenses. But not so. The crafty old
sea dog thundered forth: "I lived on my
father-in-law for the first ten years, but
I'll be if you ate going to do it!"
Next to the diamond, the hardest pre
cious stone is the ruby.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL. 4
The Bayard roast is going on over a slow
fire.
There is lots of use for the cathode ray
in politics.
Censuring Bayard is all well enough, but
how about Cleveland ?
Harrison is no longer a receptive candi
date, but there are plenty left.
The Cuban war seems more like a game
of hide and seek than a real fight.
It is now Cleveland's turn to explain
himself and put an end to the third-term
conundrum.
The Senate never hurries, and yet the
Senators always seem heated when they
arrive anywhere.
Guaranteeing the excellence of Cali
fornia fruit is the surest way of getting a
guaranteed market.
Little by little and turn by turn Salis
bury, Chamberlain and Balfour are un
twisting the lion's tail.
It is always well to remember that San
Francisco has other things to do besides
lighting the refundine scheme.
Kansas was thirty-five years old last
month and is still flirting with everything
iv sight and wedded to nothing.
While Japan is building warships China
is building railroads, and in the next war
the result will probably be different.
Tbe competitive designs for the build
ings of the affiliated coUeges are so- good
it is a pity there were not more of them.
Democratic dark horses have the satis
faction of knowing that they are not any
more in the dark than the rest of the party.
Democracy will certainly find a Presi
dential candidate after a time, for it is
making a very fane-tooth comb search for
him.
There is room in San Francisco for all
sorts of political improvements this year,
but non-partisan schemes are not improve
ments.
The Spaniards are said to hold one rail
road line in Cuba, ana on that basis they
may stiil claim to have something of a
monopoly in the island.
The tally of victories and defeats be
tween the Cubans and the Spaniards is
harder to keep than a New Year's resolu
. tion and not half so exciting.
No matter what kind of political reform
is desired it can be obtained more
promptly and more effectively by straight
politics than by any other way.
According to the treasury statement the
per capita circulation of the country is
|22.47, but there are a good many people
who have not even the 47 cents.
The Senate should so manage it as to
blend the Monroe doctrine, Pan-American
ism and reciprocity into a single policy
end name it after James G. Elaine.
With one hand kept busy in Frankfort
end the other fighting for life at Washing
ton, it is no wonder Huntington feels a
keen aesire to sit down on California.
There are said to be 100 advocates of
free silver coinage in the House, which is
just enough not to be enough to make it
â¢worth while to have a vote on the subject.
While we are trying to wipe the monop
oly off the State, Chinatown is removing
itself from the City, and it begins to look"
as if things would be clean all round after
a while.
Now that a philosopher has arisen to
declare that women should not be edu
cated we may expect one to maintain that
dress reform ought to take the shape of a
straight jacket.
The Right Honorable Arthur Balfonr,
First Lord of the Treasury, wishes a
British alliance with the United States,
which of course is equivalent to saying he
wants the earth.
Down, down, down goes the gold reserve,
and still the Democrats and Populists in
the Senate refuse to assist in passing the
emergency tariff bill that would restore
the needed revenues.
If Cleveland withholds much longer the
report of the Government commission on
the Nicaragua canal, Congress should
draw up a polite note of request for it and
hand it to him on a sharp stick.
It is strange that some members of Con
press should regard the report of Bayard's
threatened resignation as an attempt to
bulldoze the House. Such a throat is not
sufficient to scare even a cuckoo.
Huntington boasted once he could never
be tracked in business by the quarters he
had dropped, but bis course in politics
could probably be traced by the dollars he
put up, if a searchlight was turned on.
If the Senate debate on the Monroe doc
trine resolutions is held in executive ses
sion a great deal of perfervid oratory will
be lost. Shutting out the public shuts up
the mouth of many an eloquent statesman.
In declining to be a candidate for renom
nation to the Presidency Harrison show:
a full appreciation of the traditions of
American politics. Hating been twice
honored with the nomination by his party
it is right and proper be should now give
way to others.
SALISBURY'S POLICY.
The speeches recently delivered by Salis
bury, Chamberlain, Balfour and one or two
minor members of the British Cabinet are
more notable for what they suggest than
for what was directly stated. In express
terms they vaunted the power of England
in her isolation and hurled defiance at her
foes, but they suggested an eager willing
ness to make alliances with almost any
first-class power and upon almost any
terms.
The purpose of all the speeches seems
to have been not merely to allay the war
scare and prevent anything like a financial
panic, but to prepare the country for the
submission to Parliament by the Cabinet
of a scheme of foreign policy involving a
radical change from that which has been
pursued in the past. It seems clear from
what has been said by the Prime Minister
and the ablest of his colleagues, that Great
Britain will no longer oppose the colonial
expansion of other nations, particularly
of France and Russia, but will try by
conciliating them to obtain the support of
these strong powers in carrying out her
own schemes of aggrandizement in differ-
ent parts of the world.
It has been plainly stated that the pres
ent Cabinet has no objection to further
French conquests in Siam or even to an
advance of Russia into China far enough
south at any rate to obtain a Pacific port
that would be free from ice all the year
round. Clear and emphatic have been tbe
declarations also that if the United States
would consent to an alliance, Great Britain
would be willing to meet her more than
half way. In fact a portion of Balfour's
latest speech was almost a special plea for
what he called an Anglo-Saxon alliance by
which all tbe English-speaking countries
of the world were to be united for the pur
pose of carrying out what the orator called
"the duty with which providence has in
trusted us."
The suggested Anglo-Saxon alliance is,
of course, out of the question. It is not
even a debatable proposition. Whatever
chestnuts in the way of colonial posses
sions providence may have designed for
Great Britain, it has not intrusted us with
the duty of raking them out of tbe fire.
The offers to France and Russia, however,
are full of wonderful possibilities. If the
three most aggressive powers on the globe
should manage to reach an agreement
there is no telling to what extent the iusd
of the world may be altered in the next
few years. The empire of China, as well
as that of Turkey, may be dismembered
and divided and the colonies of the weaker
powers crowaed out of Africa to make way
for the domin ant three.
While such an alliance is improbable
owing to the conflicting interests of tbe
three powers, it is still possible, and it is
evident the Salisbury Cabinet is willing to
grant much to bring it about. Great
Britain has discovered her isolation and is
doing her best to overcome it. A new
move is imminent on the chessboard of
diplomacy and the conditions next month
may prove to be almost a revolution in in
ternational affairs.
CHINATOWN DISSOLVING.
It did not require the Rev. F. J. Masters,
wboknowsw.bat he is talking about, to
assure us tbat Chinatown has lost at least
10,000 of its population within the last
eleven years. If this were not sufficient
the evident intention of the Chinese prop
erty-owners to borrow all they can on their
property and then abandon it, and the re
fusal of many of the banks to lend on that
security would be amply convincing.
The exclusion laws passed by Congress
explain the situation to a considerable ex
tent, but other causes have contributed.
One of them, the value of which is likely
to De overlooked, is that the clannishness
of the Chinese and their absolute holding
aloof from American customs and affilia
tion indicate a wonderfully strong love of
their native country and a desire to return
to it as soon as possible. Many of the men
here left parents in China, and their filial
affection is probably stronger than in any
other race.
Besides that, what would be a bagatelle
in America is a princely fortune in China.
A Chinaman owning $500 in this country
changes it to 'Mexican silver coin before
going home, and that means he lands on
his native soil with about $900. This is
sufficient to support him and his family
in comfort without hard exertion. A Chi
nese who earns $25 a month in this coun
try can save nearly $250 a year above his
living expenses. Out of this he has to re-
imburse the company which advanced
him his passage money-hither, and sub
mit to certain extortions and blackmail,
besides contributing to the support of the
secret society to which he belongs, and
whose main purpose is to prevent the
operation of our laws. All in all, a Chi
nese can generally save sufficient in five or
six years to establish himself as a rich
man in China. When he returns the ex
clusion laws prevent others from taking
his place.
The scattering diabolical murders of
employers which Chinese have committed
have made many persons afraid to employ
them. At the same time the thinning of
the Chinese ranks and the increase in the
number of white persons seeking employ
ment have raised Chinese wages, reduced
those of white persons and thus naturally
operated to the supplanting of Chinese
with white workers. A gratifying consid
eration is the fact that the constant work
of organized white laborers to supplant all
the demands for labor have been a very
important factor in the case.
Chinatown has been doomed for some
time. Its decay henceforth will' proceed
as rapidly as is possible in the dissolution
of so great a body. Portsmouth Square in
time will be surrounded with handsome
structures, and lower Kearny street and
Montgomery avenue will- become impor
tant business thoroughfares, forming the
natural link between North Beach and
Market street.
LOCAL MUSICAL TASTES.
The charge that the large audience as
sembled to greet the Tavary Opera Com
pany on its opening night contained but a
very meager number of "our best people"
should be in all fairness considered in
connection with the fact that on that
evening fashionable society had a prior
engagement in the shape of a splendid
wedding in a fashionable church. That
fact in novrise diminishes the credit due
the foreign population for turning out in so
generous numbers to greet ' the distin
guished singers.
Exhibitions of a musical taste by our
best people have a complex character.
For instance, when Scheel's Orchestra, a
good band of musicians, who could play
symphonies as well as Souza's marches â
such a band may be seen in any of the
great beer gardens of the Continental cities
of Europe â was forced to quit because of a
lack of attendance, concerts by favorite
local musicians nearly always have crowd
ed audiences. Whether this may be
accounted for on the assumption that
these last-named entertainments are re
garded in the light of what some of us
have the easy but incorrect fashion of
calling a "function," or whether excel
lently rendered music of the chamber
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1896.
order happens to be more popular here
than heavy concerts, is a matter for special
ists to determine. It can hardly be denied
that when a certain concert, of whatever
kind, is deemed the proper thing, it inva
riably is largely attended.
Nothing more instructive to a student of
human nature can be found than the at
tendance at the park concerts on Sundays.
These are free, and if tbe day is fair the
number of persons present may xun to
5000 or 10,000. It is pleasing to observe
with what silence and pleasure they listen,
and how patiently they keep awkward po
sitions v.'hen good seats are not obtainable,
and it is instructive to note how marked
Is the absence of those who know what the
correct thing is. Probably this is explain
able on the ground that persons of means
have opportunities for hearing good music
(for that at the park is exceedingly good)
which are denied others.
Although this separation of what we
unfortunately call "classes" is universal in
the United States and England, it is not so
common in European cities, where the
boulevards and beer gardens are visited by
all classes. A difference in Sunday cus
toms largely explains the matter.
As a rule, San Franciscans of the wealth
ier kind are appreciative of opportunities
to hear good music, but they demand it
under the most agreeable conditions.
Patti, Isaye, Madame Tavary and many
others can give testimony to the fact, and
the hopeful outlook for the newly organ
ized San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
adds a graceful finish to the picture.
OVEBHAULING LAND PEAUDS.
Three separate and unlike movements
have been started almost simultaneously
to overhaul land titles in California and
protect the public domain. The first, with
which the public is now familiar, is the
series of bills presented in Congress by the
California Miners' Association for tLe pur
pose of preventing the patenting of min
eral lands to the railroad as agricultural.
The second is the suit just filed by B. P.
Bergin on behalf of the Attorney -General
of the United States to set aside titles
fraudulently obtained to 27,000 acres of
redwood timber land in Humboldt County.
The third comes in the form of a
petition from Zach Montgomery to the
President and Congress, praying for an
investigation of the titles to many of the
largest and richest bodies of land held
from Sacramento to San Diego under
grants from the Mexican and. Spanish
governments.
The Humboldt suit is exceedingly im
portant, not alone by reason of its in
trinsic merits, but also because it assails a
condition that by no means is confined to
Humboldt. It has been notorious for
years that valuable timber lands in the
Sierras also were secured by rich corpora
tions through dummies. The greater part
of the valuable Government timber lands
of the State have been lost to the people
through these fraudulent entries, in which
there is every reason to believe the local
Government officers connived.
The Montgomery petition is a more ex
traordinary affair, and if considered by
Congress at all will undoubtedly be
reviewed with great caution. It shows
in an elaborate presentation the fol
lowing alleged facts: That the value
of the Spanish grant lands held ille
gally and reconvertible to the public I
domain is $250,000,000, comprising some of i
the most valuable agricultural lands in
the State; that the commission created by
the act of March 3. ISSI, for inquiring into I
the claims to Mexican laud grants, ex- j
ceeded its jurisdiction in many cases, set
tling titles which it had no authority un
der the act to examine; that in the con
| lirmation the terms of the act were vio
l lated jn allotting a greater acreage that the
I Mexican granting law warranted; that the
( surveys made by the Government officers
were absolutely fictitious and fraudulent;
that fraud, deceit, perjury and bribery ran
through the whole business, and that they
were all practiced in the interest of
wealthy owners and to the harassing and
damage of poor claimants.
Not one of these three attacks upon land
titles â except infereutially, perhaps, that
made by Mr. Montgomery â comes within
the category of actions which sometimes
operate to alarm present owners, cast a
cloud on their titles and induce them to
buy quitclaim deeds. The best policy of
the State is to defend existing titles which
are regular on their face, otherwise extor
tion schemes which have been so profitable
in the past might be of endless recurrence,
and California has suffered too much in
that way for her people to regarcfr with
favor anything that looks like an attempt
to revive them.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Editor George Nixon of the Winnemucca Sil
ver State is down from Nevada, dressed in his
best suit of clothes. He arose from his couch
in the Palace Hotel yesterday morning, some
what earlier than usue.l, in the hope of being
able to find some one with whom to discuss the
silver question. The white metal has no more

stanch or perpetual champion than the editor
of the Silver State. He talks silver in his sleep,
and does a great deal of sleepiugâ that is, after
the campaign is over; but just before election
his journal gets out an evening edition and a
morning edition, and the editor never retires
until the last ballot is counted.
But, to continue, and find some one for Mr.
Nixon to talk silver with. He crossed the cour
til, walked into the billiard-room, around the
grill, out into the courtil again and presently
spotted a San Francisco friend. They Clutched
at each other's hands and retired to a corner to
have it out.
"George, you're looking pretty slick. How
do you manage to keep up such a good front
in Nevada?" said the editor's friend, in a ban
tering way.
"Probably because you San Francisco people
have concluded to let up on us a while."
"What have we got to do with you Nevadahs,
anyhow, I'd like to know?" inquired the San
Franciscan, looking across the table in an in
quiring way.
"Everything," said Nixon, taking along pull
at his cigar. "We built your town."
"What?" exclaimed the City man, bringing
his feet down from the opposite chair with a
bang. "Nixon, you're crazy."
"That's what I said. Wait a minute and I'll
give you a brief summary of how we started
San Francisco in business. In the first place
when we had free coinage and silver was on a
par with "
"Oh, rats, George. There you go on the silver
question again."
"Well, I propose to stick to it," remarked Mr.
Nixon, tapping his left hand violently with the
finger of his right. "When silvW was on a par

WAR AND NEUTRALITY.
Until the state of war arises the condition of
neutrality does not exist. Neutrality is a cor
relative of the state of war. When war, and
consequently neutrality, ariseâ and they arise
together, the one as the consequence and im
plication of the otherâ then the law of nations
also becomes operative. The character of con
traband or otherwise attaches to goods, rights
of seizure accrue to the belligerents, the state
of neutrality attaches to other nations, and
along with the state those certain duties,
privileges and responsibilities that are inci
dent to it. Prior to the existance of a state of
war and of neutrality the only obligations
resting upou nations are those imposed by
their own municipal laws. They are bound io
enforce these as a self-imposed obligation. If
they willrully neglect to do so & friendly nation
suffering througn such neglect would have a
moral claim to indemnity. lit some instances
this claim might derive support from the lan
guage of treaties.
These elementary propositions are not with
out their bearing on the resolution adopted by
the United States Senate looking to a virtual
demand upon Spain to affirm the status oi her
operations in Cuba. The position of the
United States as a friendly power is becoming
intolerable. They nave the moral right to in
sist upon being put in the position of neutrals,
to which will attach certain clearly defined
rights and duties. If Spain is engaged in a
war property contraband of war is subject to
rightful seizure on the high seas, and neutral
vessels on the high seas may rightfully be
overhauled for the purpose of ascertaining the
character of the cargo. If Spain is not at war,
but is engaged in no more than the police* per
formance of repressing domestic disorder, it
follows that shi possesses no such rights on
the high seas.
While citizens of this country offend against
its own laws by fitting out expeditions to levy
war against a nation with which it is at peace,
they have, an unimpeachable right to sell to
whom they pleabe goods which, when the
state of war exists, are contraband, and to
clear such goods at any port of entry. This
primary right is not abridged even by the ex
istence of the state of war itself. No right of
interference at the port of shipment accrues
to Spain now, so long as she is not at war, un
til the goods come within her territorial
waters. Then, but not till then, her general
police powers attach; she acquires the same
kind of right to deal with arms and munitions
afloat that she would if they were loaded on a
paektrain ashore, in custody of owners' agents
and destined to the use of rioters or insurgents.
But even if at war Spain would have no moral
right of protest nor any right of interference
till the goods were clear of port and on the
high seas.
Upon representations made by the Spanish
Minister, and acting out of its own redun
dancy of zeal, the Federal Government has set
spies over several lawful shipments, and insti
tuted proceedings to prevent their clearance,
wMch wholly lawless procedure has been
quashed by the courts directly they obtained a
hearing. In Florida similar measures have
been carried out in a way even more high
handed and without shadow of right. The
right to enforce its own laws by arresting a
?w ea Â£ j them in the very act is one thing;
the federal authority may thus prevent the
sailing of a body of men organized for hostile
operations against Spain. A vessel clearly
built for warlike purposes is not liable
to confiscation under any rule of law
so long as a state of war does not exist.
the cannot even lawfully be converted
to its own use upon payment of her value by
the Government in whose port she lies, so long
as no state of war exists. She muit not sali with
the intention of levying war on a power with
whom the Government is at peace, for that is an
ottense against our own laws, not against the
law of nations; but so long as neither proof
nor a reasonable presumption of that destina
tion can be proved against her, she has a law
ful right to her clearance. The business of
playing detective and policeman at the dicta
tion of the Spanish Minister has already put
% â¢ ( J vernment in a contemptible position,
and it Is time the whole business were etopped.
Spain is in fact at war. Let her assume all of
tke responsibilities of herpoÃition.â New York

AN EDUCATED CHIMPANZEE.
Joijanna, the educated chimpanzee, gave an
exhibition before a highly interested audience
In Central Park one day last week. The follow
ing m6rning the newspapers gave full accounts
of the wonderful things she accomplished,
particularly in the way of latter-writing and
drawing. Johanna is very fond of her keeper.
Mr. McKay, and obeys him readily. He lets
her know what he wants her to do more by the
inflection of his voice than by the words he
uses. Such words as he does use are in Portu
guese, the language, he explained, of the
sailors who captured her after killing her
mother thirteen years ago in Africa. He says
Johanna will yet learn to understand him
when he talks to her in English.
Mr* McKay began the proceedings, asitwere,
by handing Johanna a piece of cardboard, on
which he had drawn her picture. Johanna

she walked to the bar:} of her cage and handed
the cardboard and the pencil to Mr. McKay,
when, to the astonishment of ell, it was seen
she had not only made a pretty faithful copy
of the picture, but had added the arms and
body to it.
The audience applauded and Mr. McKay was
delighted.
"She can do more than that," he said, "with a
smile "She will now write a letter."
He then handed Johanna a piece of paper

COMMENT ON THE AFFAIR
Officers Assert That Colonel Mac
donald Will Enforce
Discipline.
LINE OFFICERS YET SULKING.
They Will Be Brought to a Sense of
Their Duty as Company
Commanders.
"When Adjutaiit-Gcneral Barrett was in
the City last Saturday, the day after the
election of a lieutenant-colonel and three
majors of the First Infantry, N. G. C, he
expressed the greatest satisfaction over the
result. Commenting on the scheme of re
organization he said: "The work of bring
ing order out of confusion is progressing.
The officers of the reorganized First Regi
ment are, In my judgment, able and
efficient. Colonel Macdonald is an officer
of experience and judgment. There is no
good reason why the First Infantry, a
regimental organization of twelve. comp
anies and three battalions, should not be
one of the best regiments in the National
Guard of the United States. San Fran
cisco is a large city and contains tlie ma
terial for a regiment of the .highest order.
Adjoining the City is an important post
of the regular array, where troops of all
arms of the service are constantly on duty.
Everything is favorable to the instruction
of National Guardsmen, and if officers and
men perform their duties diligently tlie
regiment should reflect the highest credit
on the National Guard of the State."
The adjutant-general was aware that
some twelve or fifteen officers of the regi
ment had "'sulked in their tents" after the
Friday night's election, ana refused to
meet at the refreshment table the officers
elect, but he did not regard the sulkmg as
serious.
Other officers of the National Guard who
had heard something of the tone and knew
â something of the temper of the companies
commanded by Captains Conley, Fitzpat
rick and Warren predicted insubordina
tion. These companies were recently trans
ferred from the old Third Regiment armory
on Golden Gate avenue to the armory of
the First Infantry on Page street.
Since the transfer there has been loud
talking, with occasional explosions of pro
fanity, but nothing like a scene occurred
until yesterday morning, when Ithe panels
of a company door were battered in. The
uproar attending the assault on the door
was great and tne language used concern
ing officers. was anything but decent.
.Tidings of the disorderly demonstration
flew quickly to other companies in the
building and to other armories in the City.
Some of the .officers recently retired or
mustered out helped to circulate the news,
and perhaps embellished the story as it
went the rounds, for it is known that sev
eral of the retired warriors have been pre
dicting all kinds of demoralization and
disaster. It is said that some of the dis
gruntled officers on <he retired list would
like nothing better than to see the reor
ganized First Regiment broken up by dis
cord and insubordination.
At a late hour yesterday afternoon
Colonel William Macdonald of the First
Infantry had not been officially advised of
the door smashing and disorderly conduct
at the Page-street armory, but unofficial
reports had reached him. He seemed
vexed and anjry at the thought of the
newspapers taking up the subject, saying
that the disorderly conduct of a drunken
soldier in a regular army regiment would
not be noticed by the press. He said :
"The press in giving undue publicity to
scenes of this Kind discourage good men
from enlisting in the National Guard.
Now, as far as I know, only one man is re
sponsible for the battering of the door at
the armory, and I assure you that he will
be dealt with as he deserves. lam going
out there to-night and will ascertain all
the facts. If any property has been de
stroyed the amount of damage done will
be held out of the camping allowance."
The fact was mentioned to the colonel
that officers of the National Guard were
generally of the opinion that he was able
to handle the regiment and' bring the dis
orderly elements to account, but he did
not relish the -allusion. 'He regarded it as
next to an insult that any one should ex
press by indirection a doubt of his ability
to enforce order and punish disorderly
guardsmen.
"The guard," he said, "should not be
accused of disorderly conduct because one
man gets drunk and makes an uproar. I
will master this regiment and enforce dis
cipline if I live and no mistake. Await
results and see. I know that Governor
Budd is with me, and I do not propose to
have any companies mustered out. The
company officers must do their duty."
The question was asked if the company
officers would preserve order by coaxing
the men to be good. . â 
"There will be no coaxing about it,'" re
plied the colonel indignantly. "Men will
be ordered to obey, and if they don't obey
they will get out to make room for good
men who are awaiting an opportunity to
enlist."
An officer who served for many years
with Colonel Macdonald in the Second
Artillery and who was recently retired
with honors said yesterday, in speaking of
the incipient revolt: "Colonel Macdonald
is all right. When he gets hb Scotch up
he will brine the ringleaders to punish
ment. He may be a little slow at first, but
will never allow a rowdy and insubordinate
element to get the upper hand of him r "
When it was suggested that Governor
Budd, General Warneld and Adjutant-
General Barrett were not going to inter
fere, but. intended to keep hands off and
allow Macdonald a fair- opportunity to
bring the regiment around in good form
he remarked:
"The Governor will not be disappointed.
The companies from the Third cannot run
over Macdonald, as they have over other
men. He will fire them out, if they have
to go by whole companies. It is just as
well that the test should come now as
later on. Yes, Macdonald will bring these
sulking company officers to a sense of duty
and proper respect for superior authority.
I know that officers as well as men are to
be" blamed for inciting insubordination in
the First Regiment. When officers kick
and talk openly about impeaching the
Governor and going to the Legislature for
redreÂ«s, men in the ranks follow their
example and treat their officers with dis
respect.
"Out at the armory, on Page street, the
companies from the old Third Regiment
threaten to carry on they did at their
armory on Golden Gate avenue. When a
remonstrance was made the other evening
about so much noise a guardsman replied:
'That isnothincr. Wait until we "rush the
growler."' Being, told that 'rushing the
growler' was not allowed in that armory
he replied: 'We will rush it fast enough,
as you will.see.' "
Colonel Macdonald visited the regi
mental armory on Page street last night
and found on inquiry that the turbulent
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, I*96*
guardsman was Private Cook, who belongs
to <Saptain Fitzpatrick's company, and
learned further that the tumult was an
individual matter and not a company af
fair. The man, who had been drinking,
was inside, and not being able to work the
spring lock, fancied that he had been
locked in. Straightway Tae seized a mus
ket, and with the butt of the gun smashed
through the panels of the door. No one
regret 3 the disorder more than Captain
Fitzpatrick.
Colonel Macdonald will rder a sum
mary court-martial at once and the
offender will be dismissed from the
service. A soldier dishonorably dis
charged from the National Guard is dis
franchised for twelve months, and unless
pardoned can neve? hold office in the
State. Cook is spoken of as a good soldier
when he is sober.
COBB GETS MAERIED.
United to the Woman Who Might Testify
Against Hint.
John W.. Cobb, who was recently con
victed in the police court under the name
of St. Clair of cruelly beating a little girl
who he claimed was his daughter, was
married yesterday by a Justice of the
Peace to Sina A. Middlekauff, better
known as Nellie Adams, with whom he
has been consorting for some time past.
It is believed that Cobb, or St. Clair, mar
ried the woman to prevent her giving tes
timony against him in case he obtains a
new trial, which he has applied for. He
was sentenced to six months in the
County Jail and is now out on bonds
pending the appeal of his case.

day.
Woywod and four fellow-sailors â John
Babis, who had also been beaten by the

the stand. Their story is that Captain de
Winter struck Woywod with a revolver,
and afterward put him in irons and beat
him while in irons. This, they say, was
during its voyage around the Horn.
The captaiii says Woywod drew a knife
on him. It is also said that Woywod was
getting a sail out of a locker andwas acci
dentally struck on the head.
TWO FOOTPADS BEATEN
Joseph McDermott Wields an Iron
Pipe With Telling
Effect.
He Has a Thrilling Experience on
Geary Street at an Early Hour
in the Morning.
Joseph McDermott, 547 Howard street,
walked into the Central police stationÂ»at
an early hour yesterday morning carrying
in his band a piece of iron pipe about rive
feet long and an inch in circumference.
He told Lieutenant Birdsall he had had a
thrilling experience with two footpads
and had vanquished them with his iron
pipe.
"I had been out visiting some friends on
the Point Lobos road," said McDermott,
"and stayed later than I intended. When
I was leaving they insisted that I should
take with me the piece of iron pipe, as the
road was loneiy and dangerous characters
were around.
"As I was walking along past the ceme
tery at Lone Mountain, never thinking of
a footpad, :i young man stepped up to me
and saiu, 'Where are you going V I re
plied, 'That's none of your business,' and
he said, 'Oh, isn't it? throw up your
hands.'
"I gave him a swinging blow on the left
shoulder with the iron pine, and he
sheered off, holding his shoulder with his
right hand, and disappeared in the ceme
tery. I think I must have broken his
shoulder bone. As I turned round.
. another young man threw his arm round
my neck and tried to garrote me. I swung
the iron pipe, but could not give him the
full force of the blow.. The pipe hit him
on the neck, and he let go his hold and ran
along the road.
"I met two policemen and told them of
my experience. They asked me to go back
with them, and on our way back we met a
sergeant, and he told me, as I had a long
way to walk, to go home. I gave him a
description as near as I could of the two
men, but as it was dark I could not tell
him much."
Sergeat Christiansen and the two police
men searched the neighborhood, but could
find no traces of the two footpads. Ac
cording to McDermott, one was 5 feet 8
inches tall, with a mustache, and the other
5 feet 9% or 9 inches, and clean shaven.
McDermott got considerable notoriety
six or seven years ago by being charged
with the murder of Herman Wessels, the
keeper of a sailor boarding-house on
Fourth street. Wessels was a brutal char
acter, and took a pleasure in abusing sail
ors who boarded'with him. McDermott
was one of his boarders and during a fight
he threw him downstairs, killing him.
He was tried for murcier and acquitted by
the jury.

TWO FISHERMEN IN LUCK
Their Nets Brought Them Up
Cans of Opium Instead
of Fish.
IT WAS A VALUABLE CATCH.
The Drug Was Sold in Chinatown for
$1600 and the Finders Are
Now Happy.
Two fishermen made a lucky haul last
week. Gold and jewels have been found
from time to time in the stomachs of
voracious fishes, but this is the first time,
that over $2000 worth of opium has been
brought ashore in a fish net. Yet this was
exactly the luck that befell Mateo Vod>no
vich and Andrew Vunivich. While haul
ing in their nets they discovered two oiled
sacks entangled in the meshes, and think
ing they had found a treasure they made
for the little sandy cove near Fort Point,
and after some pulling and hauling landed
their booty.
When the sacks were ripped open they
were found to be almost full of five-tael
boxes of opium. That night the drug was
taken to Chinatown and the fishermen
realized $1600 on their find. They divided
the money and are now taking what they
consider '"a hard-earned holiday."
When Deputy Surveyor of the Port
Rtuldell was tod of the haul made by the
li.Â«hermen he looked puzzled for ajmoroent
a.nd then said: 1% 1 wouldn't, be a hit sur
prised bat that it was the opl-.im thrown
overboard from the Rio a couple of years
ago. Those CahprnjÂ«n probably knew
what they were aft';r, as they were in a
(febing*boat near by when the stuff was
thrown overboard.
"The chase after that opium was one of
t-he most exciting ones we ever had. We
received news that the stuff was on the
Rio de Janeiro, but, although the steamer
was searched from stem to stern, we could
not find it. I finally came to the con
clusion that it would be dropped over
board as the Jtio was steaming out of the
bay. I sent Inspector Henrich out to
Point Lobos to keep a constant watch on
the steamer through the marine glasses
from the time she passed Alcatraz until
she passed out to sra. Inspector Holmes
and McGinnis I stationed at Meiggs wharf,
to await the signal, from Henrich.
"When the Kio was between Black
Point and Fort Point the news was tele
graphed that three or four sacks had been
thrown overboard and picked up by a
fishing - boat in which were three
men. Holmes and McGinnis got aboard
the Hartley and gave chase. The boat
tried to get away and the inspectors fired
at her. She came to, and as she did so
something was dropped overboard. When
we got alongside they could at first find
only two men and no opium. The third
man wasiound squeezed into a little hole
in the bow of the boat, and when pulled
out proved to be John Malanv, a. well
known hanger-on around tne Mail dock.
"Well, the three men were arrested, but
as we had no evidence they Were allowed
to go. For months the Hartley and half a
dozen Whitehall boats grappled for that
opium, but they never found it. Five-tael
tins of opium are only half full, you
know, and will float. So I suppose the
rope that kept the sacks attached to the
weights has rotted away and allowed the
opium to come to the surface. If it was
the Rio's opium that these men secured,
they made a big haul. We will inquire
into the matter, but I am afraid very little
will come of it, as .these fishermen are
very clannish and one will never tell on
another.!'
At Fishermen's wharf it was admitted
that the opium had been taken in the
nets, but as soon as the. men found out
what the information was wanted for, all
that could be got out of them was, "Me
no understand."
SHE SCARED THE BURGLAR
A Badly Frightened Woman Puts
a Midnight Marauder to
Flight.
He Was a Masked Robber and Got
Away, but He Did Not Get
Mrs. Cardan's Jewels.
Mrs. Carolah, the landlady of a select
lodging-house at 539, Geary street, is in
doubt as to whether she should consider
herself a heroine or not. Of one thing
there is no doubt. She put a masked bur
glar to flight and saved her jewels. But
then she admits that she was probably as
badly frightened as the ruffianly robber.
The exciting event occurred a little after
midnight. Mrs. Carolan had retired and
had been asleep only a short fime, when
she was awakened by an uneasy feeling
that there was some one in the parlor ad
joining her bedroon. She is a widow, and
there was no one to appeal to for assist
ance. She sat ud in bed straining every
nerve to pierce the darkness of the next
apartment.
There was the rustle of softly moving
footsteps. Then as she stared into the
darkness she saw a man walk softly past
the open floor toward an escritoire in which
she kept some valuable jewels^
His face was partly covered by a black
mask. He was tall and seemed to be quite
burly. Mrs. Carolan at once realized that
he was a burglar and was almost paralyzed
with fright. A second later she recovered
her senses and began to scream. Then,
with the one thought of getting away from
the dreadful stranger, she ran for Ihe door
opening from the bedroom into the hall.
Here she met another fright. Her
screams had frightened the burglar, who
at once fled from the parlor into the hall
also. The result was that Mrs. Caroian
ran full tilt into him a3 he was sprinting
toward the hallway.
Thinking she meant to capture him, the
fellow gave ncr a shove that was not quite
a blow and increased his speed to such a
rate that he missed his footing on the
stairs and .gave an impromptu imitation
of tobogganing down an. uneven incline
without a toboggan.
The burglar could not have been seri
ously hurt b3 r his long fail, as he was gone
when the people of the house gathered to
Mrs. Carolan's assistance. It was evident
that he had not been at work in the room
very long, for he secured absolutely no
booty.
FIRED IN HIS MOUTH.
Harry Bubon Attempts to Commit
Suicide in the Odd Fellows'
Cemetery.
J. J. Fredericks, a" carpenter, livine at
3413 Geary street, was working in the Odd
Fellows' Cemetery yesterday afternoon,
and between 4 and 5 o'olock he heard two
shots fired in rapid succession. He hurried
in the direction of the sound and found a
man lying on a pathway with blood pour
ing out of his mouth and a revolver
clutched in his right hand. Fredericks
telephoned for the ambulance and the
wounded man was taken to the Receiving
Hospital.
Drs. Weil and Rinne found that the man
had evidently placed the muzzle of the
revolver in his mouth and pulled the
trigger. The bullets had cut his tongue
and had lodged in the back of the neck.
The probability is that he will recover.
The man after regaining consciousness
said by means of pencil and paper that his
name was Harry llubon, biit he refused to
give his address. He was out of work and
felt despondent. In his pockets were a
riask of whisky, a box Qf cartridges, $3 60
in silver, a seaman's discharge dated Feb
ruary, 1894, with the name cut out, an
employe's ferry ticket in the name of
Harry Rubon, and a Dawn ticket for a gold
watch and chain and diamond locket, with
the address Mike* Milan, East Berkeley,
written ou the bottom.
REPUDIATED HER MOTHER
Lily Hansall Did Not Relent
Toward the Parent Who
Forgot Her.
Mrs. A. Standberg Claims Her Daugh-
ter After Fifteen Years of
Separation.
"I would rather work like a slave than
go with you. 1 will throw myself into the
bay first."
These harsh words were addressed by
15-year-old LiJy liansall to the mother she
has never known. They were spoken with !
determination, and one look at the dogged
expression of the girl's face showed that
they were not rashly spoken.
When Lily was 4 months old her parents
agreed to sepnrale. Her father went East
and the child was placed in care of Mr.
and Mrs. Buschel, the mother, who re- j
niained in the City, pay-ing liberally for \
her sustenance for more than two years.
After that the contributions ceased, and
Lily was cared for by Mr. and Mrs. Buschel â 
as though she were their own. When the
girl was 12 years old the mother, who :
had married again, asked a writ of !
habeas corpus in order to regain the
seemingly forgotten child, but such
writ was refused by both Judge Murphy
and Judge Levy. Less than a year ago
Mrs. Buschel died and her husband fol
lowed her a few months later. Their
daughter, Mrs. George McNiece, took thÂ«. ;
child into her keeping until she left for tho
East last summer, when Lily answered an !
advertisement for a nursegirl and so se- i
cured service with Mrs. Browell, who â 
lives on Lombard street and is a daughter
of Slater, the mind-reader.
Mrs. A. Standberg has been active for
months in reparation for years of seeming
forgetfnlness. She called on Mrs. Mc-
Niece in May, but had only a glimpse of
her child, for Lily refused to see or talk
with her mother. Mrs. Standberg has made
repeated calls recently at the offices of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children, asking the intervention of its
authorities in order to bring about an in
terview with her daughter. This was ac
complished for the first time yesterday.
The girl, wno is neat and comely, went
to the office accompanied by Mrs. Browell.
She showed no feeling except fearandaver
sion when she met her mother. Mrs.
Standberg seemed to feel keenly thegirl's
uttituae, but talked to her kindly, assuring '
her that when she gave papers of indenture |
to the Buschels she did so because she
had not the means for her support, and
that since she had a comfortable home and
would soon go to Germany to enjoy it, she
wished to take the girl with her. The
daughter's answer was like a blow :
"You left me when I was a baby."
The mother paled a little at" this, but
continued to urge the child to go with her,
which she steadfastly refused to do. No
prediction that she would have to be a do
mestic all her life troubled Lily. "I would
rather be a 9lave than go with you," she
declared. She would not even consent to
visit the mother occasionally.
Officer Frank Holbrook asked the girl to
call later in the week, when they would
confer as to the appointment of a guardian,
a favor she had requested.
There was no evidence of relenting to
ward her mother. When Lily left the of
fice she walked close to her employer and
averted her eyes.. She did not even vouch
safe a farewell to the disappointed woman.

MARKETING DRIED FRUIT
How California Growers Can
Realize the Most Money
From It.
SOME PROBLEMS ARE QUEER.
A. R. Hall Says Large Coast Buyers
Have as a Rule No Basis on
Which to Purchase.
A. B. Hall of St. Paul, who has some
original ideas as to how the dried fruit of
California should be marketed, is at, the
Occidental. He said yesterday, when seen
by a Call representative:
How to market the dried-fruit product
of the State at a profit to the producer is
beginning to be of very general interest.
More than the usual number of knotty
problems have presented themselves to the
California fruit. grower in the few years
that he has been producing fruit in quan
tities suiFicient to displace the foreign arti
cle, so that it is not strange he should have
some of them yet unsolved.
From one end of the State to the other
heard the complaint from growers
that their orchards are proving unprofita
ble property and that mortgages and in
terest have accumulated to still further
complicate conditions.
The lack of ready money to defray ex
penses of production in many instances
compels the grower to hypothecate his
crop, and b} r so doing he Joses control of
the price to be received for it and the
method to be pursued in marketing it,
leaving to another, not always interested
in his welfare, to set the price he receives
for the product of his labor. In this wav
seeds of demoralization are sown and in"
discriminate consignments East have nat
urally followed.
It is not to be expected that dried-fruit
dealers will purchase outright a commod
ity when by making a reasonable advance
they can secure the product withont incrrr
ring the risk of marketing, unless in C3se
of advancing market, when a profit is an
ticipated in buying, which condition, un
fortunately, has not existed for several
years.
In this way has the coast buyer of Cali
fornia dried fruits been driven from the
market, in many cases after financial loss..
occasioned by competing in the Eastern
markets with promiscuously consigned
goods.
Nor is it to be expected that the Eastern
wbolesale buyer will matte f. o. b. pur
chases when his market is full of consign
ments, frequently in the hands of incom
petent and unscrupulous dealers, from
whom he can buy at any price above the
advance, freight and commissions.
As matters now stand the lar^e coast
buyer:*, as a rule, have no safe basis upon
which to buy this product. The wholesale
Eastern buyer has not a safe, staple mar
ket upon which to make f. o. b. purchases.
It is only when the article reaches a ruin
ously low figure that he feels safe in mak
fug f. o. b. purchases.
While this is not a very pleasant pros
pect, it is tlie present condition of affairs.
W hile it is impossible to name a remedy,
owing largely to the scattered interests of
the producers,- and the lack of sufficient
capital to hold their product until it is
wanted by the consumer, there are a num
ber of practices that could be discontinued
to advantage.
A series of "don'ts" suggest themselves.
Don't dry inferior, undesirable fruit.
It ciinnot be produced at a profit, and

GEARS POSITION
FULLY DEFINED.
A Friend of the Pastor's
Talks Plainly of the
Affidavit.
THE BULLETIN ACCUSED.
Rev. Dr. Pond Makes a Clear
Statement Concerning the
Committee.
MRS. COOPER IS INDORSE!).
Opposing Factions Prepare for a Bat
tle Royalâ Rev. Mr. Tnbb
Is Wroth.
The Gear affidavit published in The
Call during the early developments of
the Brown-Davidson scandal and which
was not much thought of at the time, ex
cept so far as it reflected on the character
of Mrs. Stockton, seems likely to cut an
important figure in the case.
The sworn statement of the attorney
was not considered by the general public
as a particularly strong defense of Dr.
Brown, neither was it thought to be proof
positive of Mrs. Stockton's blackmailing
propensities. The reason of this, as a prom
inent member of the church expressed
it yesterday, was because the affidavit was
6worn to just thirty days before the scan<
dal became public, and was also entirely
unsupported.
"The wording of the statement was most
peculiar," said a gentleman who is in close
touch with the pastorâ .in fact he has seen
the evidence by which Dr. Brown hopes to
ultimately fully vindicate his character.
"To the casual reader," he continued,
"Mr. Gear has made it appear that Dr.
Brown was the only person referred to.
Now, as a matter of fact, the part relating
to the pastor does not appear until near
the end. All that goes before has direct
reference to two or three persons on whom
Mrs. Stockton attempted to levy black
mail. The affidavit was given to "the pub
lic without a word of explanation and it
was but natuval that people should be in
clined to draw wrong conclusions.
"Dr. Brown has in his possession, which
he will produce at the proper time, all the
letters and papers mentioned by Mr. Gear.
These taken with the affidavit will con
vince any judge, jury and even the skepti
cal public, that Dr* Brown was never at
any time guilty ol an improper act with or
toward -Mrs. "Stockton. The pastor will
also be able to satisfactorily explain to the
world why the charges which he preferred
against the winsome widow were never
prosecuted to a finish.
"As to Miss Overman that is all plain
sniiing. Dr. Brown has done a daring
thing in facing all tuis, but he did it
openly and with a full consciousness of
the trying ordeal through which he must
pass in order to secure the conviction of
the woman who demanded hush money.
His relations with Miss Overman were of a
purely friendiy character, and the proof
thathe has to support this is so convinc
ing as to require no stretch of imagination
or fancy to believe.
"The question has been asked over and
over again why he does not give this up.
The answer is plain and simple. He rec
ognizes that he is dealing with a crafty
set â people who would not hesitate to de
feat justice, no matter how contemptible
the means employed. He knows the wo
man he has to deal with â be knew her the
instant she attempted to levy blackmail
on him, an.l he cannot afford to take any
chances. Why, he. has indisputable proof
in his possesson that one of the witnesses
for the defense in the preliminary hear
ing committed wholesale perjury. If he
should give the name of thi3 person to the
public, do you not suppose that the de
fense would immediately set about to
Btrencthen this weak spot, though it
could only be done by again sacrificing
the truth? It is worth a great deal to the
community at large to get a woman like
Mrs: Davidson out of the wny, and in
stead of proclaiming Dr. Brown guilty the
public should applaud his actions.
"When the Davidson trial is ended, Dr.
Brown will make his statement, and I
venture the assertion that those who op
pose him most bitterly now, will be the
first to shake his hand then."
Dr. Brown has not yet decided on his
plan of action so far as it relates to the
mayer-meeting to-night. It is not proba
ble, however, that he will attempt to take
the lead in the face of Mrs. Cooper's
avowed antagonism and those who follow
her.
It was stated yesterday on the highest
possible authority that there was every
probability of Dr. Brown demanding an
immediate investigation by the council.
This action is scheduled to take place to
day if at all.
Whether this is done or not the charges
made by Dr. Warren against Mrs. Stock
ton, must, according to congregational
usages, be made the subject of immediate
inquiry.
One of the sensational deyelopments of
the day came in the accusation of Dr.
Brown to the effect that the Bulletin
forced the now famouÃ Valentine letter.
The charge of the reverend gentleman
will be found elsewhere.
Some fifteen or twenty members of the
First Congregational Church, representing
the disaffected members, held a meeting
last night. A resolution was adopted con
demning the hissing of Mrs. Cooper last
Wednesday night. This will be presented
to the congregation to-night. In addition
a committee was appointed to draft reso
lutions â first, indorsing the statement
made by Mrs. Cooper, and second, oppos
ing the adoption of Deacon Barnard's res
olutions of confidence.
The postponement of the eccleciastical
council was also considered, and it is prob
able that the committee will hand in a
resolution condemning this.
The dissenting faction is confident of
success if the ol<3 members who withdrew
when Dr. Brown was first called, will only
turn out in force.
PREPARED FOR BATTLE.
Brownltes and Antl-Brownltes Are
Ready for the Issue to Be
Decided This Evening-.
All the members of the First Congre
gational Church showed yesterday that
they fully realized that tim evening was
to be fought one of the greatest issues that
have ever forced themselves upon the
members Of that society.
It was plain from many indications that
the strength of the contestants was being
systematically and thoroughly marshaled,
and that the impending contest would be
entered by both factions with a determin
ation to come out victorious.
For tbe past weelc the leaders of each
Bideâ and this is but fair to say does not
mean Dr. Brown on the one hand ana M rs.
Sarah B. Cooper on the other â have been
checking over the church-roll with a view
to ascertaining just how strong each was
in the matter of following.
But this was merely preliminary. Since
the tint etep there have been active comm
ittees and temporary secretaries at wors,
calling upon or writing to the members
who have heretofore maintained a strictly
neutral attitude.
This work has been done in a quiet but
thorough manner, and as a result the
attendance of church members at the
meeting to-night is likely to be the largest
that has ever been seen at a Wednesday
evening prayer-meeting.
Each side expressed confidence yester
day that it would be able to carry thing 3
its way, but those who are opposed to the
adoption of the resolutions expressing con
fidence in the integrity of the pastor go so
far as to state that from an actual count
they are certain they will be able to kill
the resolutions of the joint committee and
of the officers of the church.
In support of this assertion of Strength,
attention was called to the manner in
which the Strauss case was won. and also
how the members refused to adopt Dr.
Brown's suggestion that all members be
stricken from the roll of the church who
had not been to communion for a year.
Had the resolutions gone to a "vote
last Wednesday they would probably
have been adopted, as many of those
who are now avowedly opposed to them
were then absent, quite a number being
away in the country. These have been
summoned home and will make it a point
to be present at the meeting this evening.
Another point that will make the defeat
of the resolutions extremely probable is the
fact that elements that on other matters
have been apart are united against the
resolutions.
To-night's action will decide the ques
tion whether a council is to be deferred at
the pleasure of Dr. Brown, who, according
to his owq public ntterances, is more
anxious for the conviction of Mrs. David
son than for thp early vindication of his
reputation, or whether it is to be called at
once. Snould the resolutions go through*
Dr. Brown will have his way. Should
they be defeated it is difficult to see. say the
members, how the immediate convening
of a council can be prevented.
There, remains one way, according to one
of the most active officers of the church, in
which Dr. Brown can yet take the wind
out of the sails of his adversaries, and this
officer is one who has the best interests of
the pastor at heart and who is, in fact,
very close to him at the present time and
has been during all his trouble. This is
for him to call a council at once to investi
gate the matters reflecting on his reputa
tion.
Informal meetings of the officers of the
church were held yesterday, and among
the most important matters discussed was
this proposition. It has been laid before
the pastor, and there is a possibility that
he may forestall all contention by adopt
ing the course mentioned.
Adherents and opponents both admit that
such a proceeding would at once put an
end to all discord and do more than any
thing else could do at the present time to
keep the members of the church together.
On the other hand any other course is cer
tain to create factions and a breach that
will be greatly detrimental to the interests
of the church.
It has been stated that among those who
advised Dr. Brown to retain his pulpit was
Deacon D. Gilbert Dexter. On being a-ked
if this had .been his attitude, Mr. Dexter
replied that just the. contrary was true.
Continuing he said:
The fact is I addressed a letter to him and
told him as a friend and as a friend of the
church that it would be better for all con
cerned if he would not occupy, the desk on
Sunday or Wednesday evening. 1 had no reply
to the letter, and did not know whether Dr.
Brown would or would not occupy his pulpit
on Sunday, and 1 don't think any of the board
of deacons did.
ACCUSES THE BULLETIN.
Dr. Brown Thinks That the Forced
Letter Emanated From the
Newspaper Office.
Dr. Brown was very evidently much
pleased last evening when he exhibited a
letter which had been brought to him
f rom the Bulletin oifice during the day
and which he Said completely cleared up
the mystery of the forged letter.
"I do not care to make the contents
known at the present time," he said, "but
I can say with perfect freedom that it places
me in a much more comfortable frame of
mind than I was before its receipt.
"It is in exactly the same handwriting as
was the forgery ana is from the same per
son-that inspired and wrote that docu
ment. The author apologizes humbly for
the trouble he has caused me and promises
to repair the damage as far as he is able.
He tells why he forged the name of Mr.
Valentine arid why the letter was >ent to
the Bulletin. The matter will be fully
ventilated very soon." The doctor caused
the following letter to be written last
evening and signed it:
February 4, 1896.
Editor Call: I have very strong reasons to
suppose that the Bulletin itself caused the
writing of "the forged letter," which it was
first to publish .and which, in the face of strong:
evidence to the contrary, it has persistently
and viciously ascribed to me.
1. The Bulletin is the only paper to which
my Sunday notices have been sent in writing,
the other papers copying from that. Conse
quently that paper had at hand the specimen
of ray writing on which io frame the
clumsy and altogether unsuccessful at
tempt at imitation.
2. The Bulletin took the forgery and
specimens of tny writing to the ex
pert, Mr. Eisenschimmel, as the Report
says, and he very soon decided that I could
not have written the forged letter and so told
the Bulletin; but that report was suppressed
and another expert was sought who could find'
as ttie Bulletin desired. Why should that pa*
per have suppressed the report favorable to me
if its attempt to find the truth was honest?
3. Although Mr. Valentine promptly pro
nounced in my favor to the editor of the Bul
letin, in my presence, that editor closed hig
report of that interview with the contemptible
insinuation that suspicion was still on me.
\Vhy should not the editor have given great
and decisive weight to Mr. Valentine's opinion
if it wag after thetruth only and had no ax to
grind?
4. But finally, to-day tne Bulletin sent to
my house ft letter addressed to nic in care of
the editor of the Bulletin. No letter was ever
addressed to me in his care before. My"
address is quite as well known as his. Why
should this letter have been so addressed?
The reason was revealed when the reporter
sent by the Bulletin had the Impudence to ask
that the letter should be opened in his pres
ence. The Bulletin wanted another sensation
and, in my opinion-, had itself attempted to
prepare it in the letter that came to me to-day,
ana which it took pains to. address 60 that "it
should pass under the eye of its own editor.
The inclosed letter was anonymous, and pur
ported to come from the writer of the forgery,
avowing Its authorship and expressing regret
for the trouble he had made me. The Bulletin
doubtless thought I would be so pleased with
the anonymous vindication &s to fall into the
trap and become the willing victim of a con
temptible trick.
.Gentlemen of the Bulletin, this may be.
"journalism" in the region of "632 Bush
street," but In the estimation of honest men it
is the basest of perfidy. If you were honor
able men you would have aocepted the abund
ant proofs that I did not write that letter; but
you have persisted in affirming that I did. I
have one case in the courts now, hence you
know that you are safe in this dastardly kind
of attack. Yours is the last resort of cowards.
A generous public will demand that you shall
seek more honorable weapons before you are
permitted to kill me. ChaeleÃ O. Brown.
DR. POND ON THE CASE.
Describes the Action of the Joint
Committee and Exolalns His
and the Church's Attitude.
The following communication addressed
to The Call is self-explanatory.:
Mr. Editor: Reading my Mobniko Call to
day I came upon a report of an interview with
myself which does an injustice to me because
It makes me do injustice to ray friend, Rev. W.
H. Tubb, the scribe of the Bay Association.
The interview was a briei and hurried one, ber
cause I could gee that the members of a board
of directors to which I belong were waiting for
it to be finished in order to begin an important
meeting. I, therefore, do not wonder that the
reporter failed to get my meaning or to re
member my words. As I was one of several to
whom he spoke he may have confounded in
his recollection some things said by others
with what I said. At any rate, I did not use
any such expressions as these: "I cannot for
the life of me understand how he (Rev. Mr.
Tubb) could bave.madeÂ«uch a mistake (as to
say in his minutes of the meeting of the asso
ciation that the <;ommittee on Df. Brown'i
case was n committee to investigate). It look*
very much as if they (the minutes) were spe
ciilly prepared.
What I did say was this: "Mr. Tubb mis
apprehended Dr. McLean's motion for a com
mittee. It was broader thaa vis record, as
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1896.
printed, made it. â¢ It was for the appointment
of a committee to do .whatever I seemed wise - to
be done in Dr. Brown's case." > Of i course.* this
included investigation, if that were seen to be
a wise and timely move. , And it suggested the ;
possibility that an* investigation, \ if r. made,
might be conducted by others and not by the
original committee. original committee
was one with full power, so far as the associ a
tion could confer any power. Â».' â â¢< â¢-; â¢'-â -â : : r
It has never entered my mind at all and no
such intimation ever escaped my lips; as that
Mr. Tubb "specially prepared" his record with
a purpose either favorable 'or â  unfavorable to
Dr. Brown. He in incapable. Of such a ' false
hood." He made the record as he understood j
the motion; but failed to get-, the motion ex
actly as it was made. -I am sure that Rev. Dr.
McLean would corroborate my statement. :" ;"*&
' If you will give mefurther space I willmake
a statement of the facts concerning this com
mittee, for which I am willing to be held re
sponsible: : . ; . : .
The Bay Association is ; a club of Congrega
tional ministers, meeting at stated times j for
fellowship and mutual improvement. It has
nothing whatever to do.with what is technic
ally, called 'â¢ministerial standing.'V But like
any other club cf decent men it would take
cognizance of immorality or indecency in any
of its members, and an.expulsion from it 011
such grounds would doubtless ruin the stand
ing both professional and social of any of its
members., .'- .-,â .-â¢â  .- . , â  -... .. : <Â,-'.i -â â (,â 
A certain board of directors to which Dr.
Brown belongs: was called to meet during the
recess of that, meeting of the 'association at
which the committee on Dr. Brown's case was
appointed. - After the board had concluded its
business, Dr. 1 Brown requested the members to
remain a few moments as individuals, and to
advise with him. . The result 6t this consulta
tion was this motion of Dr. McLean, and the
appointment of this committee. There was at
that time, on the. good old Anglo-Saxon ground
that man is presumed to be innocent till
proved guilty," a conviction in the minds of
all his brethren that Dr. Brown was guiltless.
It, was believed, and hoped for by others,
that if, say, three brethren; universally trusted,
could examine these proofs of Br. Brown's in
nocence, which he ;is compelled at present to
keep in reserve, -and -.could; report, that these
proofs wefe conclusive, amounting to a moral
demonstration, this ; would lead the public
generally and Christian people particularly
to wait in patience and hope till the time
should come when they might safely be I pub
lished. At thai time tlie committee appointed
by the association believed that this would be
possible, aud seeking those persons whose
names would probablo carry greatest weight
they requested Rev. Drs. McLean and Mooar
and Hon.E. D. Sawyer to examine the proofs
and make the report. But unavoidable delays
occurred. New developments were made. -â â -.-
At length the original committee, acting in
concert with Drs. McLenn and Mooar, after a
careful and protracted canvass of the situa
tion, decided to wait upon Dr. Brown and ex
press to him their conviction that no 6uch ex
amination of I his proofs, however conclusive
they might be found, could meet the case. It
would bear the appearance of a one-sided in
vestigation and could not set things at rest.
And in view of this we announced our de
cision not to attempt the impossible, and not
to see one side until we coula be free to take
in all sides. He was at first manifestly disap
pointed, but finally appeared (q be > convinced
that the decision we nsd reached was wise. r ' â 
I The result to which we came waR, with some
.modifications in the expression of it, adoDted
by tue joint committee of the church and the
association, and it virtually included these
points: ./ :/, '
1. An investigation of the " most thorough
character to be made as soon as present obsta
cles to i% can be removed, and the sooner the
better. ..,..-.- :.._. -.j .-_'.;:â >.- : v-> '"<-.'';â :.-â 
2. Till such an investigation becomes possi
ble, judgment to be suspended and confidence
to be continued. The grounds of this "confi
dence" will be different in different persons;
doubtless they were different in the minds of
differing mi-mbers of the joint â  commiitee.
With .some it may have been nothing more
thtin the principle :of Christian charity, an
Anglo-Saxon justice above referred 10; "with
others it was this with the addition of Dr.
Brown's record in the past; with others it may
have been both these and the bad record of his
chief accuser; with others.it may have bieen
ground-ed in a complete conviction, unshaken
nnd immutable, in Dr. Brown's puritvof con
duct and character. It was with the possi
bility, and perhaps the consciousness of this
diversity in the bases of confidence that the
declaration was made. And this is where ac
tion must cease 'for the present, unless the
First Congregational Church, which is the
Supreme Court in this case, sees fit to press it
to a quick as well las a decisive | inquiry. This
it can do, but what it will decide to do, it alone
can tell. Respectfully,-. WiiXTAJi C. Pond.

TUBB IS ANGRY.
Takes Exception to the Aspersions
Made on the Accuracy of
His Minutes.
Rev. W.. H. Tubb is somewhat wroth
over the aspersions made with reference to
accuracy, and in substantiation of his
claim that the minutes of the Bay Associa
tion as published recently in The Call arc
correct sends the following communica
tion :
To the Edilnr of the Hominy Callâ Dear Sir:
I find in this morning's issue'of The .Callcom
ment? on the minutes ot the Bay Association
in which my neme is made to figure.
This matter is not loft to the dullness of
senility or the fervid imagination of youth.
It is simply a matter of record. A plain state
ment is in order.
The minutes have never passed out of my
custody since I became scribe.
They have not been "specially prepared."
When Dr. C. O. Brown made his statement I
on the 13th of January, 18i)G, I was alert, be
ing his friend, and felt that it was absolutely
necessary to be "letter perfect" in making the
minutes. I wrote it then and there as it stands
to-day. There was 110 "cooling time." The
request to keep the name of the committee
asked for by Dr. Brown f-ecrct was rendered
nugatory by one of the members of the associ
ation, who gave the names to a reporter. I
was called into the Sunday-school room to in
terview a Mr. Donnelson, concerning a dis
play card for Bethlehem in a church directory.
I saw the names as stated and reported the
same to the association. Secrecy coul3 not be
had. In writing a synopsis for the Pacific I
made a literal transcript of the minutes and
took it to Dr. â Williams, who said, "That's all
right."
At the close of the session Miss Lister of The
Call and the reporters of the other morning
papers came to my table. Rev. F. Flawith ana
Rev. J. D. Foster were there also.
Mr. Foster objected to the wording of the
minutes. I remarked, "I will change it so as to
retain the sense of the motion."

STRONG ARRAIGNMENT.
A Business Man Reviews the Situ
ation In a Legal and
Critical Way.
"I have outlined no particular plan of
action for the meeting to-morrow night,"
said Mrs. Cooper yesterday. "I have
asked no one to stand by me, because I
need no support in doing my duty. My
only fear is that I may fail to know my
whole doty."
Mrs. Cooper continues to be the recip
ient of numerous letters indorsing her
course and yesterday there came to her
a tetter irom a well-known business man
who reviews the situation in a legal and
critical way. The name is not given, be
cause Mrs. Cooper does not feel at liberty
to publish it without the consent of tbe
writer. The letter reads as follows :
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooperâ Dear Madam: Please
allow a stranger to write you a few lines by
way of encouragement in the great and trying
ordeal through which you are now passing. I
.am not a member of any church in this City,
though I have often attended services at the
First and Third Congregational and occasion
ally at other churches. I have kept a slight
trace of yonr sad affair, and havo heard Jhe
opinions of many, and I believe that the great
masses are arrayed on your sfde. They have
some interests at stake, and they feel that it
will be a great blow to Christianity if the mem
bers of the First Church, in any manner or for
any reason, smother r most thorough and an
immediate investigation. Christianity is at
too low an ebb ia San Francisco to be trifled
with in'Buch an ungodly manner, and merely
that one man, backed up by a coterie of Influ
ential deacons, may wreak his personal re
venge 01: alone woman.
What matters it to the best interests of the
church where Mr 3. Davidson, spends the re
mainder of her life? Wilt herconvietion purify
the divine? Will it play any greater part in
the erascnient of the stains upon his character
than the truth or falsity ol her charges played
or will play in her trial ? These charges can
not be Inquired into legally during her trial.
The two olfenses are in no way related, and
the question as to whether or not she is to be
convicted should not delay for a single hour
the investigation of- Pastor Brown. And wny
should he lor a moment refuse to vacate the
sacred pulpit for a time until by competent
decree he be recalled to his post, exonerated
and possessing a clear conscience, if innocent?
But it appears that he insists upon standing
on his legal rights. The true Christian i* will
ing to stand on Christ and trust to God. Mo
hammed, rather than Christ, seems to be th.c
model of Mr. Brown, and he uiisheaths and
would wield his sword when the one great
captain said, "Put up thy sword."
I am not a lawyer, Out I venture the predic
tion that after what has happened, if Mrs.
Davidson be tried first, she will Purely be ac
quitted,, if ably defended; then woe to the
leader in the First Church, for what council or
committee would then have the courage to ap
ply the brush ?
Human nature is a well-known commodity,
and easily weighed by one that studies it, and
the brilliant lawyer studies it and understands
it, and knows pretty well his jurymen and
how they look at life. Ministers generally live
in two spheresâ in heaven and in self. The
lawyer also lives in two spheresâ in self and in
the world; and while he often misses heaven,
he finds in that world many things "not
dreamed of in taeir philosophy."
Again, would the loss of your present pastor
be an irreparable one? 1 conless that often
after hearing him and feeling the dearth of
thought and spirit that permeated his dis
course, the question as to why I went forced
itself upon me, and I could see no reason ex
cept the music. The preacher should improve
the mind or ennoble the soul or do both; but I
fail to see that Mr. Brown does either, except,
perhaps, with the most plastic.
Some months ago I was an observer at the
Monday Club of the conduct of Dr. Brown,
when Dr. Ilerron was here. lamin no wise in
sympathy with the visionary doctrines of the
latter, but I was impressed wilh the gentle
manly and Christian manner inÂ»whlch he pre
sented them, and in which he received the
scurrilous rantingsof his critic, until the latter
was hissed and forced into silence by his own
people. He, of cQurse, claimed that the
hissings and objections came, from non-mem
ber 1 !, who, he EaUi, were interlopers, although
a large sign in the hallway invited everybody.
His boisterous conduct toward a gentleman, a
stranger, in frontof me was shocking in the
extreme. The gentleman, touched at the in
sult of Dr. Brown, was endeavoring to loam
from the chairman, Dr. McLean, if it was the
wish of the meeting that visitors snould retire;
but Dr. Brown dominated over everything and
everybody for'the time, and sSveral times told
the gentleman in stentorian shouta uiisuited
to any place but a prize ring to tit down. His
unchristian-like conduct led me to say, on
leaving the room that though he might sport
a D. D. and the pastorate of a rich church, his
career of usefulness was nearly run. Like cer
tain comets that swing into view, reach their
greatest brightness and sweep on, so he will
probably soon have to forego the baskings in
public iavor, and march on never to return.
Notwithstanding my views concerning him,
still, for many days after the scandal became
public, 1 defended him, to the surprise of some
of my friends, who expected I would be ready
to condemn. But whatever 1 may have thought
he might have it In his heart to do, I did not
believe that he could under the conditions
preceding and surrounding him fo far disre
gard the dictates of common-sense as to be
auiltiV of the crimes with which he was
charged, notwithstanding his silly course in
certain things. Nevertheless, when the Over
man letters came out,! coUapsed, and shall
not return to his defense; for even though Moses
should arise from the dead, he could not at this
late stage-explain them in any way not con
sistent with culpability upon the part of Dr.
Brown. For who has said they are forgeries?
And if they are genuine, but untrue, who can
excuse the present conduct of the man con
cerned in harLorinsr the libeler and conspira
tor? And if guilty, let him step down from hts
high place, fold his tent and silently steal back
into the wide world, ami. if truly penitent,
start life anew. As Mr. Tubb says, his present
policy is suicidal. He reminds me of the man
that by mean?, of a cowhide tried to force his
wife to love him. How much more Christian
were he to say, "Lord, thy will be done." His
attitude seems to smack of tyranny and
money, and that of the committee of intimida
tion.
You deserve great credit for your noble fight,
and I wish you, and thousands wish you, com
plete success. But lock well to the rudder
Wednesday night; for 1 fear that the wheeis
will be set, the button touched, "click" will go
the machine, and brave Mrs. Cooper, the stand
ard-bearer of right and uprightness, will be
crushed for the time; but "truth crushed to
earth will rise again." I trust that all your
friends in the church will rally around you
without fear on- that trying night, and may the
Lord give you strength and courage to do his
bidding.
l'iease don't feel under obligations to an
swer. I know your burdens are heavy. Very
re>]>ectfully yours, _ . .
Among the most recent letters addressed
to Mrs. Cooper is the following from a
Presbyterian clergyman who a few years
ago was under a clouu on a charge of hav
ing misappropriated the funds of an in-
Btiiution with which he was connected;
and tbere is clear evidence in the letter it
self that in sending it to Mrs. Cooper he
was actuated by a strong fellow-feeling for
the accused pastor of the First Congrega
tional Church:
31 y Dear Mrt. Cooper: I desire to express my
high appreciation of your valuable services to
the cause of human elevation along tlfe lines
of true Christian service, And to express the
opinion that every step you take before the
public is done from the promptings of a sin
cere heart.
Notwithstanding tbi3, l am moved by a sense
of duty to address you on the subject of the
controversy now growing up in the First Con
gregational Church of San Francisco, in which
your pastor, Dr. Brown, is the central figure,
and through the public press your dear self is
arrayed on the other side as the leader of an
opposing force.
I have not had a word or a line from any one
concerned in the matter, but have a. whole lot
of experience as a "central figure," hung up
as a model by the public press, turned round
and round, exhibited by the "penny-a-line"
man, who writes for what he can get out of it.
Yourself, as well as the public of San Fran
cisco, California, and much of our Nation, call
to mind the contest through which I passed in
D,n effort to maintain my name and profession
against an arrayed body ot clergymen.
Reporters are keen observers of the tinder
currents and of the public mind and write up
as wanted. Many of them Bald to me while so
writing, "You must understand, that we have
no rnspect for those old chumps, but we are
writing for the public."
Since I resumed my profession two of them
came to me and expressed regret for what they
said. One of them said, "I then said privately
that there was but one fair-minded man fhere
and he was the man on triaL"
Now, I am % judge of newspaper reports
when c, Protestant .minister of the gospel is in
volved, and desire to say that not an iota of
credence should be given to what is said about
him in the daily press of San Francisco.
Not a line is written for the good of the public,
but for what can be made out. of it by the
writer and by the sale of the paper. I have
watched with much interest the actions of
Dr. Brown since this matter was made public,
and feel that he is justified in the step he has
taken. I fully believe thatif treated fairly and
given time to reach the conclusion he will
be justified. I base my judgment mainly on
two things:
Firstâ Upon the ground of the action taken
by such honorable men as comprised the in
vestigating committee. They were permitted
to know the ground of defense which Dr.
Brown has in hand, and they have decided
that it is good and that his moral conduct is
worthy of public confidence, end th.it he is
entitled to the right and use of his office and
snould not be deprived of it during the time
required to make known to the public the facts
in the case.
The second ground upon which I rest my
judgment is the character of the women in
volved. Surely the record of Mrs. Davidson is
such as to satisfy any one of the plot of which
she is capable, the decision of the Judge being
that her own story confirms her guilt. Of the
Mrs. Stockton there is but one opinion, and
that 1b that she is a high-toned feminine de
pravity, whose flippant words published in the
press, obtained by young lady reportersâ
which is no credit to them or to the paper en
couraging them by giving to it publicityâ brand
her unworthy of confidence.
Jf in tha case of . Dr. Brown a
precedent is established, -that when a Chris
tian minister is evil spoken of he must
retire from his office until he clears himself,
no man can feel that he has a title to his pro
fession stronger than the tonsue of slander.
It should be taken into consideration that
we are living in an age of new social environ
ments, where there is no separation of the
sexes in business, society or church. Women
are everywhere, entering" any and every office
as employes, agents and in many other capaci
ties, and if mere rumor of the statement of de
praved women is to be accredited then no man
is safe and no household can breathe easy for
a night nor until the morning paper has passed
the scrutiny of the breakfast table.
It is becoming in Christians to stand together
and mourn with those who mourn when the
scoffing world hangs together with a death
grip upon the skirts of a man ordained to
preach the gospel.
I feel that Airs. Cooper should have Teposed
confidence in Dr. McLean, Dr. Williams and
other ministers and in the officers of her
church and awaited ia patience the tiiaM
when, in their opinion, the public should know
the facts.
I caÂ»not tell you how much I regretted the
publication of the letters received by you from
your friends, which appeared in The Sunday
Call.
God knows that all men who are trying to
press their way up the stream against the cur
rent of this sin-cursed world have a hard
enough task Without opposition from others
Awoiting patiently fo?. the end and evidence
of the right, I am yovrs sincerely,

BUYING THE LEGACIES
Petition of the Collateral
Heirs to the Fair
Estate.
Judge Slack Wants More Testimony
Before He Will Order the
Sale.
The petition of the minor collateral heirs
to the Fair estate to be allowed to sell their
interests came befora Judge Slack yes
terday, but no action was taken until fur
ther testimony could be secured.
John A. Percy, guardian of and counsel
for the heirs mentioned, was on the stand,
and he was questioned by Judge Paterson
and Charles S.
|| The interests desired to be sold are those
of the children of Margaret Lundyj James
G. Fair's niece, and tbe children of James
H. Fair, who was James G. Fair's nephew.
To each family was left $10,000. The inter
ests of the . Lundy children amounted to
over $1400 each, and v the interests of the
Fair children to $1111. They had been of
fered the full value of their estates, and
tlirough . their guardian ad litem, Percy,
they had petitioned to be allowed to do so.
| Under questions Percy testified that if
tne court allowed the sale the. heirs would
receive all that any will would bring to
them, and relieve them from the prospect
of losing all should James G. Fair t be de
clared intestate. .' Also he said, it relieved
them of the necessity of paying council
fees in any succeeding litigation which
may take place. ' -. ..-^
â¢ I Judge Slack said he would like some tes
timony from the parents as to their .finan
cial condition before going further, and
the case was continued . for two , weeks to
allow depositions : to be i sent . from lowa,
where they live. The parents have already
sold their interests. It was indirectly :ad
mitted that the children, of James Fair
were the would-be purchasers. '.

THE FAIR TRUST.
Attorney R. B. Mitchell Explains His
Opinion as to the Effect of
Judge Slack's Decision.
The following communication is self
explanatory :
Sak Francisco, Fob. 4, 1896.
To the Edilnrof The Vailâ Dear Sir: In this
morning's Call lam incorrectly reported in ref
erence to Judge Slack's decision in the Fair
will case. lam reported as having said that
under his decision the will stands -without the
trust clause and that the trustees hold the
riroperty pending distribution as special ad
ministrators instead of as trustees. What I
did say to the reoorter who interviewed me on
this subject was, that if Judge Slack's decision
was affirmed by the Supreme Court the realty
would descend to his heirs at law and be freed
from the operation of the trust, but that the
decision did not affect the personalty, which,
as the matter now stands, would go to the
trustees under the terms of the will. 1 did not
say that the trustees would hold as special ad
ministrators. The parties named as executors
in the will of September 21 are holding as spe
cial administrators until one of the two wills is
admitted to probate ; they then give way to the
executors. Nor did I express my confidence in
the Supreme Court affirming Judge Slack's de
cision. I Eald that his decision was a very
learned one, bore the imprint of a great deal
of hard labor and thought and that whether it
was approved or disapproved by the Supreme
Court on appeal tt would always place Judge
Slack In the front rank of. nisi prius Judges.
Very truly yours, R. B. Mitchell.
ANGRY IRISH-AMERICANS
They Protest Vigorously in Re
gard to Supervisor Joe
King.
His Appointment as Chairman of the
Finerty Reception Committee
Denounced.
t Most of the leaders in the movement for
a fitting reception to John F. Finer ty, the
distinguished Irish-American, who is to
deliver the oration on the occasion of the
Emmet anniversary on March 4, were sur
prised and indignant on reading in The
Call yesterday of the appointment of
Supervisor King as chairman of the re
ception committee at the meeting on Sun
day night.
The committee as named consisted of
Supervisor Kin*, T. B. O'Brien, J. J.
O'Brien, Judge M. Cooney, Tnomas Des
mond and Captain Jeremiah Sheehy.
With the exception of T. B. O'Brien and
Judge Cooney- the members will refuse to
act.
A special meeting of the committee of
arrangements will be called for some night
before the close of the week to have an
other chairman of the reception committee
appointed. If this is found to be impossi
ble the matter will be brought up at the
regular meeting on Sunday night. If
Supervisor King should persist in holding
the position of chairman other arrange
ments for the reception of Mr. Finerty
will be insisted upon.
"It was a surprise to most of us," said
one of the leaders yesterday, "when we
learned of Supervisor King's appointment.
It was done at a star-chamber meeting, by
a few of his friends, when the others
present were busily engaged discussing
other matters.
"There are many reasons why Mr. King
is ineligible for such a position. He is not
a leading representative of the Irish race;
he has not the gift of clothing his thoughts
in fitting terms, and his record is not be
yo'rd reproach. There are many men in
our societies who are deserving of the
honor of being chairman of the committee
and who in every respect woutd do credit
to themselves and the representatives of
the Irisn-American race in this City. That
they should be ignored and the position
given to a man who is simply a politician
is not to be tolerated. "
HE WAS OFFERED
A BIG BRIBE
Police Judge Campbell Says
He Refused to Be
Tempted.
IN CAPTAIN LANE'S CASE
Assailed on Every Side With
Proffers of Six Thousand
Dollars.
HIS HONOR'S FINE BON MOT.
The Telegraph Hill Villains Could Not
Tamper With a Lower Court
Magistrate.
Police Judge Campbell was offered a
bribe of $6000 and he spurned the offer.
"It was not offered to me outright, this
way," emphasized his Honor, Illustrating
his explanation by proffering bis out
stretched palm, "but it was in the air all
about me, wherever I looked, to whom
ever I spoke; in fact, there was $6000 for
me on all sides if I'd take it in that Tele
graph Hill case."
Judge Campbell delivered himself of this
bit of reminiscence yesterday when a Call
reporter called upon him on a subject for
eign to tbe present one. In the dim past
some other newspaper had accused him
of dividing with his subordinates $5 fines
after they had;been imposed or $6 amounts
before they were registered.
"Think of it," he said, derisively, "me
dividing $5 in three parts."
The idea was simply too ridiculous for his
Honor to withhold his risible system, and
his whiskers shook in lauguter.
Judge Campbell is a big-hearted and
good-natured magistrate who does not
take a pessimistic view of life. He be
lieves in that fundamental principle of
justice that all men, and women for that
matter, should De held guiltless unless
proven otherwise. Hence his apathy in
grabbing the $6000 sack, and the man on
the other . nd of it.
"There was no rank offering of money,"
he reiterated in & second interview, "but I
knew that all I had to do was to reach out
and take it. The $6000 was there at air
times for me, but only a fool would take
money like that in s.uch a case."
The particular case is that of r Captain
Lane, the old man of wealth who hasgot
himself in trouble from too close attention
to the little girls about Telegraph Hill.
His case, as well as those of a number of
similar ones, has come before the Police
Court over which Judge Campbell pre
sides, and his Honor has invariably held
the defendants to answer for their alleged
crime before the Superior Court. Quite
recently one of the men, a man named
Ratz.was sentenced to a terra of ten years'
imprisonment. It was in connection with
this particular case, when in the Police
Court, that Judge Campbell delivered him
self of a bon mot. Ratz, who is a very
poor man, and who had not the advantage
of an attorney, pleaded that the court ap
point one for him.
â¢'â¢All light, Ratz," Judge Campbell said;
"I'll appoint some terrier to look after
your case." -

The victims of the accident on the Sutro

Miss Suter, who is about 20 years of age,
sustained an incised, clean cut wound
several inches in length , and several other
injuries. There is yet a strong hope of the
young lady's ultimate recovery; Two
physicians have been in attendance since
the accident, and last evening they stated
that if there is no change for the worse
durum the course of the next five or six
days, the chances for recovery will be very
great.
Since the accident "Miss Suter has sev
eral times been unconscious, but that is
believed to be due to the shock to her sys
tem. Perfect quiet has been enjoined, and
to prevent her nerves being jarred by sud
den noises, a warning card has been placed
on the door: "Do not ring the bell."

Twenty-second avenue, ..between Point

obliged to go into the yard to attend to her

years' playing in the kitchen, where there
was a lighted stove. ,. â¢

house ; a fearful sight met her gaze. Her
baby was writhing in the midst of smoko
and flame. To catch up the child, wrap it
in a 'rug and quench the flames was the
work of a moment for the frantic mother,
and the piteous screams of the tortured
little one soon changed to low maans.
Dr. Frank B. Petrie was summoned as

THE ITALIAN CRUISER CRISTOFORO COLOMBO AS SHE APPEARED AFTER COMING TO ANCHOR BETWEEN THE COAST - DEFENSE SrEAMER MONTEREY AND
THE CRUISER ADAMS.
[Sketched yesterday by a "CaU" artid.]
booming of cannon announced that the
Italian warship Cristoforo Colombo with
Prince Luigi of Savoy had arrived. The
vessel has been looted for with' impa
tience, as the members of the local colony
are eager to welcome the nephew of the
King of Italy to Ban Francisco. As soon
as the warship came to an anchor a com
mittee, headed by J; F. Fngazi, boarded
her and wa9 cordially received by Captain
Alessandro Bertolino. The young Prince
was on duty, so an interview with him
could not be had at that time, but the vis
itors were informed that if they returned
later in the day they would have a chance
to lay their plans before him.
The Crintoforo Colombo is an armored
cruiser, deck protected, and -was built in
Venice in 1892. She carries six 4%-inch
guns and a minor battery of rapid-firing
guns. She is of 2767 tons displacement
and is bÂ»rk rigged. While classed as an un
armored cruiser the Oristoforo Colombo is
really a training-ship. Since leaving
Genoa she has visited India, China, the
Philippine Islands, Australia, Tahiti, Ha
waii and BritUh Columbia. The last port
at which she touched before coming to
this one was Victoria, B. C.
The list of officers on the warship is as
follows: Commander, Alessandro Berto
lino; lieutenant-commander, E. Presbitero;
first lieutenantsâ Prince Luigi of Savoy,
Umberto Carzin, TJgo Reiribo, Luigi Resio,
Ettore Figerio, L. Dellippo; second lieu
tenants â Ignazio Aymerick, Edoardo
Winspeare, Carlo Fenzi, Gilberto Arriya
bene; chief engineer, G. B. Ricca; assist
ant, Vittorio Carmel; doctors â Carlo Belli
and L. Guira; commissary, Giovanni Po
liti.
There are 212 men in the crew. Scarcely
any of them speak the English language
and only one or two of the officers are
thoroughly conversant with it.
After leaving Victoria, B. C, the war
ship came slowly down the coast, at no
time making more than five or six knots
an hour. She was sighted at 10 a. m., and
four hours later was at anchor between the
Monterey and Adams. Immediately aft
erward the American flag was run up at
the fore and a salute of twelve guns fired.
Lieutenant Hough, acting commander of
the Adams, visited the Cristoforo Colombo,
and Italian Consul Qrimaldi was among the
first to arrive. He welcomed Captain Ber
tohno on behalf of trie colony and the
Italian Chamberof Commerce.
In speakiijg about the cruise of the war
ship Captain Bertolino said it was for two
purposes: first, the training of the men,
' and second, to show the King's nephew
the world. The Colombo will remain here
until March 1 next,. after which she will be
taken south, stopping at San Diego, some
of the Mexican ports, possibly Panama,
and will go thence to Chile. After a short
stop at Callao the cruiser will go through
the Straits of Magellan to Montevideo,
Eio de Janeiro and possibly New York.
This is the programme as outlined by the
captain, bur of course it is liable to be
changed at any time.
"We have been most enthusiastically re
ceived at every port of call," said the com
mander, "and our lives for some time
back have been one round of gayety when
in port. Our countrymen here seem de
lighted to see us, arid though many of
them are citizens of the United States,
they have still a warm place in their
hearts for the mother country. Trie Prince
has enjoyed the trip very much and the
officers have learned a great deal from the
hard training they have been compelled
to go through whiie at eea."
The crew of the Cristoforo Colombo are
a -fine-looking set of men. Some of the
officers are very handsome fellows, and all
are sure to be great favorites while the
cruiser is in port. Shore liberty will be
given to-day, and then Prince L'uigi will
take his first drive over the cobbles of San
Francisco.
Prince Lnigi of Savoy is very young,
having just completed his twenty-third
year. He was born at Madrid during the
reign oi his father, Amedeo, on January
I 29, 1873. His mother was the jrreat Italian
heiress, Maria del Pozzo della Gisterna,
who died when her youngest son, Prince
Luigi, was only 4 years of age. Amedeo,
later in life, after he had abdicated the
throne of Spain, married his gay and
sprightly niece, Princess Lotitia.
If the Duke Degli Abruzzi were to rejris
ter his full name it would be "Prince
Luiei Amedeo Guiseppe Maria Ferdinando
Francesco of Savoy," but he generally
answers to the appellation of Prince Luigi
and only uses his other baptismal names
in legal documents. He is a good-looking,
unaffected s'oung sailor, tall and rather
slight, with a pleasant, intelligent face,
and he is said to be as full of energy and
good humor as he evidently is of rude
health.
On board, the officers and men say he
never presumes on the fact that he is a
Prince. He had to stand his watch yester
day, just as the other lieutenants did,
and though he was anxious to learn some
thing of the American city, which was full
of novelty for him, he spent the afternoon
on deck without thinking of uttering a
murmur.
Prince Luigi's father, Amedeo, who died
during the first grippe epidemic, five years
ago, was not looked upon as the most
brilliant member of the Bavoy family;
in fact, it was sometimes whispered,
even in court circles, that he was
the . nonentity of his house. Amedeo
had an honest, kind heart, how
ever. Whether his Spanish subjects
showed signs of revolt against his govern
ment, he at once exclaimed, "Let no blood
be shed in sustaining me on the throne,"
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1896.
and without more ado quietly abdicated
the throne. After. that he lived quietly in
Italy, and in Rome, Milan and Turin he
was a familiar sight for years, driving on
the corso and bowing right and left to his
brother's subjects with the pleasant con
descension of royalty.
It is said by the enthusiastic officers of
the Christoforo Colombo that Prince Luigi
inherits his master's intelligence and his
father's easy-going good-natured charac
ter. At the ball recently given in Van
couver in his honor he entered into
the spirit of the thing with zest
and discretion; that Is to say,
he danced energetically all even
ing, but always with the ladies his
aids-de-camp pointed out to him as the
partners to whom social duty pointed ;
pretty girls and ugly girls, ladies who
were passe and buds who were scarcely
outâ the Prince danced with them all and
showed them equal attention.
it is those dragons of aids-de-camp,
aided and abetted by the commander of
the ship, Cay. A. Bertolini, who hedge
in the poor Prince with a good deal more
of the pomp and circumstances of royalty
than the frank young sailor would assume
if he were left entirely to his own desires.
He is a great talker, and he would converse
pleasantly to all" comers, but he is told
whom tie ought to talk to and whom he
ought not, and in such matters it is the
painful duty of royalty to obey orders.
For instance the aids-de-camp do not
encourage the Prince to squander any
words on newspaper men. One of, them
said when asked whether he could be seen
and conversed with, ''Oh! it is quite im
possible to approach Sua Altezza" (His
Highness). The officer added that the
Prince himself strongly objected to be
ing interviewed. It happened, however,
that among the newspaper men who had
rowed out to the Cristoforo Colombo was
one who had been pointed out to the
Prince as a fellow Italian. His Highness
made a sign tojhis aid-do-carap, Cavalliere
Cagni, that he wished the Italian scribe to
be presented, and then, without even wait
ing for the ceremony of a formal intro
duction, he warmly shook hands, with his
compatriot and niade a few cordial re
marks to him on the weather, the climate
and the thousands of miles that separated
them from home.
"Many thanks for the newspapers you
sent mej" he said, as he dismissed the first
reporter with whom he has exchanged a
word since coming to the New World.
Cay. A. Bertolini, commander of the
Cristoforo Colombo, distinguished him
self by his prompt action some years
ago when relations were strained between
prance and Italy and he held a command
in the Mediterranean. Commander Berto
lini tvi s born at Mantova4s years ago, his
family being one of the foremost in that
city. The commander is enthusiastic over
the Prince's tractability and good nature.
questioned on the subject, he stated
that "Sua Altezza" does servioe on board
exactly as the other lieutenants do, and
added "Bene! It is better for him to know
life as it is."
Cay. Calegaris, president of the Ital
ian Chamberof Commerce, stated yester
day that the Prince had expressed his will
ingness to attend the ball next Wednes
day for the benefit of the Free Italian
School. He also said that the Prince and
the other officers would name a day next
week to attend the banquet which the
Italian Chamber of Commerce will tender
them.
The Prince's aids-de-camp on board the
Cristoforo Colombo are Cay. Cagui and
Cay. Frigerio.
BOLD GANG OF PIRATES.
Four Ex- Convicts Arrested by Two of
the Mounted Policemen.
Ranchers and others In San Mateo
County have within the past few weeks
Buffered considerable loss through the
operations of a gang of pirates, who stole
chickens, calves, wheat, oats, bones and
anything they c,ould Jay their hands upon.
About 2 o'clock yesterday morning
Mounted Policemen Patrick McKenna
and John P. Carson saw four suspicious
characters with a wagon near the Six-mile
House on tiis San Bruuo road. One waa
driving the wagon and the other three
were walking behind it. The policemen
questioned them, and, not being Satisfied
with their answers, they placed them
under arrest and took them to the Beven
teenth-street Btation, where they were
placed on the "detinue book."
Tho wagon contained about two tons of
bones, and last evening, through the
efforts of the two mounted policemen, they
were identified as having been stolen from
the Pacific Bone Factory, on the Ban
Bruno road, between the Six and Seven
mile houses. The wagon had been
borrowed from a peddler named Hansen
on Monday mom ing. and the gang had
driven the horse all day and night, until it
was nearly dead. Besides a charge of
grand larceny, a charge of cruelty to ani
mals will be booked against the gang.
The names of those arrested are : Cnarles
Wieruan, Frank Tyrrell, Thomas Gill and
Joseph Hart, all ex-convicts. They were
thoroughly organized to carry on their pi
ratical work and took care always to drive
into town with their plunder during the
night, or at such time when they thought
there was the least chance of being ob
served by the mounted squad.
For years a curious phenomenon has
been noticed oa Lake Winnebago, in Wis
consin, where, aÂ« soon as the ice forms
solidJy, an immense crack opens almost
exactly in the center cf the lake, extending
lengthwise from one end of the lake to the
other. The crack is now three to six feet
wide and about thirty miles long. It is
supposed to be caused by the expansion of
the ice, and the pressure against each shore
being equal, the upheaval and fissure
appear in the middle.
There are no Jewer than 13,000 school
masters in Germany whose salaries fall be
low Â£40 per annum.
WATER FOR THE FRONT.
The State Harbor Commissioners
Discuss the Mains and
Hydrants.
ELIMINATING THE MIDDLEMEN.
Reducing the Wharf Tolls in Tan
barkâThe Unadilla's Landing
Place.
The Board of Harbor Commissioners
sat Bomewhat as an arbitration commis
sion yesterday afternoon and several ques
tions tha-t have perplexed the water front
were decided.
During the session the name of Stewart
Menzies came before the board as a person
who was inclined to usurp the functions of
Chief Wharfinger in the matter of moving
ships and that official complained accord
ingly.
"I ordered the ship Hyderabad, lying at
Harrison-street wharf, to be shifted and
her mate refused to do so. Upon inquiry
I learned that 'a man' had advised the ves
sel'Â« officer that he need not obey the
wharfinger. I found out that the man was
Stewart Mfinzies, and that the captains of
British ships considered him a sort of par
amount commissioner on the water front.
I have bard work explaining Mr. Menzies'
remoten ss from the Harbor Commission
to the officers of those vessels.

foro Colombo.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
"Who is Stewart Menzies?" asked Mr.
Colnon. "Is he a State employe?"
"No, sir," answered C&ief Wharfinger
Root. "He is a stevedore on the docks,
but he runs the town and pretty much all
the front."
After the board officially learned of Mr.
Menzies' unofficial capacity, the chief
wharfinger was told that Mr. Menzies
could countermand the orders of State
officials, but the master of a vessel who
obeyed him would get into Berious trouble.
A petition was received from "a number
of wood dealers asking that the wharf tolls
on tanbark be reduced from 10 cents' to 5
cents per cord. The reduction was ordered
madÂ« and to take effect yesterday. .
The petition from the proprietors of
Cousins' drydoek for a reduction of rent
was denied.
A request was received from Captain
Howison, commandant of Mare- Island
Navy-yard, asking for a place to dock the
tug Unadilla, which arrives every Friday
morning from the y.ard. It was thought
that if a landing-place was reserved for the
tug the Navy Department should pay the
regular rates as paid by private persons;
otherwise she Would have to take her
chances of finding a vacant place. The
matter was taken under consideration.
Chief Wharfinger Root stated to the
board that the damage done Washington
street wharf by the Unadilla in a collision
last week was only trifling, and was not
of sufficient importance for mention.
The following communication was read
by Secretary Keegan :
San Franctbco, Cal., Jan. 27, 1896.
To the Honorable Board of State Harbor Com
missioners: Having noticed through the
columns of the San Francisco press that you
are looking into tne matter of water rates now
charged by Goodall, Perkins & Co. to the ship
ping of this port, we, the undersigned vessel
owners and agents, netition your honorable
board to continue such investigations and
pray that some relief from the ejcis ting exor
bitant water cherges may be obtained through
your efforts:
Caspar Lumber Company, Russ, f-anders &
Co.. North Pacific Steamship Company, B. H.
Madison & Sons,. C. A. Hooper & Co., George
Fritch, J. S. Kimball, Samuel Blair, Gray &
Mitchell. Charles Kelson, Usal Redwood Com
pany, S. E. Slade Lumber Company.
Mr. Colnon said regarding the water
question he did not see why the Spring
Valley Water Company should be allowed
to farm-out the business as they had been
doing on the water front.
"Our bill of $97 for water supplied by
Goodall, Perkins & C 0.," said he, "is lust
$55 more than at the late fixed in this City
by the Supervisors. Of course, the State
will not pay any more such high, un
necessary bills. There is no means of
knowing what Goodall, Perkins & Co.
make out of the privilege of snnplying
ships, but I have been told from $65,000 to
$100,000 a year. They pay the Spring
Valley Water Company $1,600 per month,
and I don't imagine that corporation
would let thp other concern' get such a fat
draw-down.
"Now I am told that the vessels out in
the bay take comparatively little water.
They don't use much during the few days
they are at anchor; consequently I can't
see. why the Spring valley people
cannot supply the ships at the docks with
out sending their water through another
company. The middleman business is
not commendable. Two members of the
Grand Jury were here yesterday and said
that the Spring Valley people offered to
supply vessels directly from their mains.
No, I think the whartingers and collectors
on the front could, after the service was
gotfeen down to a system, attend to the
hydrants and hose. But as for that mat
ter the Spring Valley Company could em
ploy an inspector or two to distribute
water to vessels, and would save money if
the Goodall, Perkins people now make
$65,000 out. of it. I think some arrange
ment will be made to eliminate the mid
dleman altogether. As it is, the State will
take the initiative in dealing directly with
the water company."
A new bird nas been added to toe list of
those found in Wisconsin. It is name <
the scissor-tailed flycatcher.

at Milwaukee, Wis. In accordance with my
expressed intention I am as yet confining
myself to a statement of the principles of
the order. The planks of the platform I
have, however, interspersed with questions
to Peter C. questions calculated to
force him to define his position and shame
him, if possible, out of the guerrilla meth
ods he has heretofore employed' in waging
warfare against a patriotic organization.
The planks of the A. P. A. platform will
be found in quoted paragraphs.

Question 22â Does Mr. Yorke favor National
or State legislation in favor of any one section
of the country or of any class?
Mr. Editor; In my letter, which appeared in
your columns last Sunday morning, in which
j stated officially the objects of the A. P. A., I
asked Mr. Yorke some questions because of
his avowed enmity to the order and his recent
bitter attacks upon it. To my surprise Mr.
Yorke, heretofore so eager to challenge and
zealous in reply, still at the end of three days
maintains a sphinx-like silence.
Is it that he cannot answer my questions
though expressed in simple phrase? Or is it
that, he dare not?
It is within the possibilities that those
queries escaped even his omniscient eye. I
desire to give him the benefit ot the doubt and
would not wish to take an advantage of him
even though to my questions his silence
might, as the proverb has it, give consent.
For this reason I repeat the questions here.
A FEW QUESTIONS.
Question Iâ Does Mr. Yorke deny that pol
itics need purifying or does he object to their
purification?
Question 2â Does Mr. Yorke object to our at
tac king any religious organization attempting
to become a factor in politics?
Question 3â ls Mr. \orke hostile to our aim
to preserve and. maintain the Government
against all foreign influence?
Question 4â Does Mr. Yorke regard religio
political organizations as friends to civil and
religious liberty?
Question sâ ls it not, in Mr. Yorke'a opinion,
unsafe and unwise to put in office men who
owe allegiance to a foreign power?
Question oâls.0 â Is. Mr. Yorke an enemy of the
free public school system and does he favor
MipplanthiK it with a sectarian institution?
Question 7 â Does Mr. Yorke oppose protect
ing our citizen laborers from Kuropean pauper
and criminal labor and is he hostile to honest
and educated immigrants who propose becom
ing American citizens and who will forswear
allegiance to every foreign power?
Question Bâ Does Mr. Yorke oppose putting
into oilict' honest and true men â patriots who
are qualified and who owe allegiance solely to
the stars and stripes?
My object in asking these questions is not to
embarrass Mr. Yorke, nor to place him in any
false position, but to secure if possible a
definite statement of the particular principles
of the A. P. A. which he, as an enemy of t^e
organization, condemns. Respectfully.,
B. r. HrDELsoji.
. State President of the A. P. A. of California.
WITH TRUE LOVER KNOTS
Mrs. Jewett Decorates Her Home
for a Tea for Miss
Cheesman.
Barton Hill's Daughter Wedsâ The
Foorman Surprise Party â The
Armer Reception.
It was a young girls' tea, in every sense
of the term, the entertainment given yes
terday afternoou by Mrs. J. H. Jewett at
her residence on Bush street.
Miss Jennie Cheesman, a most popular
sociely belle, was the guest of honor. Only
young girls were invited. The decorations
were such as make maidens utter number
less and ecstatic ohs! and ahs! There
was delightful music and theTefreshments
were dainty and elaborate.
Mrs. Jewett's home, which is so admir
ably adapted for entertaining, with its
many large apartments which open into
one another, was beautifully decorated for
the occasion. In the corridor, nestling in
the tangled midst of vines and ferns, was
an immense bunch of poldeneschscholtzia.
In the dining and drawing rooms tender
young wildtlowers were used 10 relieve the
uniform green of the palms and the many
growing plant? arrayed with artistic effect
about the apartments.
But quite the most attractive of all these
adornments were the true lovers' knots
which stood out in bright relief from the
dark wood wall?.
. In the dining room there were pink lov
ers' knots. They were eoquettishly tied
to picture frames, bonbo.i dishes and
vases, and they formed a border of delicate
raised-work on ttie snowy damask table
cloth. In the library there were blue true
lovers' knots and white true lovers' knots
and they even found a place amid the se
vere decorations of the drawing-room.
Mrs. Jewettand Miss Cheesman received
the euests, Assisted by Miss Sallie May
nard, Miss Ethel Lincoln, Miss Jennie
Catherwood, Miss Wood. Miss Bessie
Bowie, Miss Jennie Aldrich, Miss Mary
Harrington and Miss Delia Mills.
During the afternoon there were musical
numbers by Miss Mills, Miss Catherwood
and Miss Harrington.
The hours of the tea were from 4 till 6,
and there were about seventy-five young
ladies present.
Miss Marion Hill and Charles R. Hill
were quietly married yesterday, at noon at
the residence of the bride's mother, 1718
Broderick street. Mias Hill is the daugh
ter of the veteran actor, Barton Hill, so
well remembered in the palmy days of the
old California Theater stock company.
With her mother ana sister she has re
sided here for many years. The young
eroom is the traveling auditor of the" Gulf,
Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad.
In the parlor of the family residence,
standing in a bower of lilies, the happy
young couple were united by the Rev. Dr.
Mackenzie. The sister of the bride, Miss
Leila Hill, was maid of honor, and Charles
Barton Hill was best man.
The bride wore a modish gown of mignon
ettee silk tiimmed with old lace.
Mr. and Mrs. Hill left yesterday after
noon for Galveston, Texas, and after a
short visit will proceed immediately to
their home at Fort Worth.
BamVness yon Schroeder will give a
large luncheon to-day at her home on
Sutter'Street.
On Saturday last Mrs. S. Foorman was
delightfully surprised at her residence,
2022 California street, by a party of ladies,
all indefatigable co-workers in the noble
cause of charity.
For the past twenty years Mrs. Foorman
has been the honored president of that
most benevolent body, the Israetitcher
Frauen Verein. Through her efforts and
those of the ladies who have served sc
faithfully with her, the Frauen Verein has
an enviable record. Thousands of people
have been aided by this beneficent society,
and many thousands of dollars expended.
It was to testify their esteem and deep
respect to the retiring president that the
members of the old boardâ Mrs. Sarah
Plum, Mrs. Charles Fechheimer, Mrs. Sol
Wangenheim t Mrs. George Greenzweig,
Mrs. Eppinger, Mrs. William Herschfeld,
Mrs. Hannah Cook and Mrs. Joseph Din
kelspeil â headed by their venerable secre- '
tary, Leo Eloesser, tendered the lady a
surprise party.
Fortune favored the ladies, and during
Mrs. Foornian's absence they took posses
sion of the home, decorating drawing
room, dining-room and corridor with
fragrant blossoms and palms and ferns.
The table especially occupied their atten
tions, and when the ex-president of the
verein returned home she was greeted by
a most tempting and beautiful sight.
Good cheer prevailed for several hours,
and a most delightful afternoon was spent
by all. A notable feature of the afternoon
was the presentation by Secretary Eloesser,
in a few- well-chosen words, of a hand
somely framed set of illumined resolutions.
Miss Minnie Mendelson was the guest of
honor at a charming reception given at the
residence of the Misses Armer, 1316 Octavia
street. Singing and dancing were the
features of the evening until mid-Tiight,
j when an elaborate supper was served.
Among the guests were: Mr, Larney
Mendelson, Miss Edna Armer, Mr. Leo
Silberstein, MissT. Barnett,Mr. J. Kragen,
Mr. Max Licht, Miss Minnie Mendelson,
Mr. feolomon, Mr. Jacobi, Miss .Bessie
Armer, Mr. Rosenberg. Miss Sarah Basch,
Mr. Joseph Bascb, Miss M. Mitchell, Mr.
Greenfield, Miss L.' Mendelson, Mr. and
Mrs. Mitchell, Mr. and Mrs. Armer.
Much Married Mills.
The marriage of C. R.,Mills to Elizabeth Ann
Stuart was annulled by Judge Sanderson yes
terday and Mills was ordered to pay his real
wife, Annie K. Mills, $35 a month alimony.
Mrs. Mills claimed her husband married again
without securing a divorce from her, and so
sho sought to have the marriage annulled.
Mil. a married the second woman in Alameda
on June 19, 1894. He was married to the real
MrÂ§. Mills in Cincinnati in April, 1889.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1896.
BUNKOED INTO SIGNING
A Railroad Interview That Was
Not What It Seemed
to Be*
DISMAY AT WASHINGTON CITY.
An Exposure of the Methods of the
Southern Pacific's Paid Sym
pathizers.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 4. j
Much excitement was caused in political
circles to-day by the receipt of dispatches
from some pf the California representa
tives at Washington asking what certain
Oaklanders of some political weight were
doing. The result was the exposure of
certain underhand methods being pursued
by the Southern Pacific Company through
their local lieutenants to create erroneous I
impressions at Washington regarding the
focal feeling toward the refunding bill.
Borne weeks ago a carefully written in
terview on the railroad matters now before
Congress was handed to several people for
signature. The affair was kept a profound
secret and many men whose names carry
weight were obtained. The document was
a Machiavellian affair, that sought to con
vey ideas that were not expressed. It was
in keeping with many similar documents
that have been sent out by the
railroad and published in papers
that are supposed to be its
organs. Under the semblance of wishing
to see justice done and of a desire for
California's welfare there was more than a i
hint that the bulk of anti-railroad agita- |
tion was without any foundation in fact.
The gist of the double-barreled communi
cation was such as to create an impression
at Washington that the people of Oakland
were not opposed to refunding and did not
look with favor on foreclosure of the de
linquent roads.
The paper arrived at Washington in due
time, and there was consternation in the
Caiifornia delegation. It was a direct lie
to the arguments being put forth by the j
representatives of this State against re
funding, and an explanation was de
manded. Dispatches were sent to Oak
land, an inquiry was set on foot and then
the discovery was made that the document
signed by so many Oaklanders was not
wnat it had seemed.
Some feeling was displayed and those
who had signed werÂ« particularly bitter
against those who, they claimed, had per
suaded them to do so. One of the most
prominent names was that of M. J. Lay
mance, chairman of the Alameda County
Central Democratic Committee. There
was great consternation when it became
known that Laymance had gone on record
as in favor of refunding and an explana
tion was expected.
Laymance stated to his friends that he
aigned the paper at the solicitation of his
friend, ex-Senator W. E. Dargie. Lay
mance stated that he was not aware he
had done anything of the nature attributed
to him and immediately set about to rec
tify it.
This was done by the getting of another
document ttiat was signed to-day by sev
eral who bad formerly signed the docu
ment that is already in Washington. Mr.
Hoicamb is another man who claims that
he did not understand the original docu
ment. The refunding document reads as
follows:
To the Representatives in Congress: It has been
reported to us that a certain document signed
by some of the following is now In the hands
of Congressmen. We wish it to be understood
that anything purporting to come from us that
is not in perfect accord with the arguments
and views expressed by Senator White and
Congressman Maguire is false. Also anything j
that, is in. any way opposed to foreclosure is I
not in accordance with our views, and if any i
document expressing contrary opinions ha's
been signed by us it was done- under misappre
hension of the nature of the paper presented
to us.
The first signature to this document is
that of Chairman Laymance, and then i
follow the names of the Democratic county j
committeemen. M. J. Laymance was
seen to-night and asked about the matter
ana said :
It is true thnt I have signed a paper to Con
gress stating that I am definitely In favor of
the foreclosure ot the delinquent roads and of
everything advocated by Senatpr White and
Congressman Maguire. I do not wish to talk
of anything else, but I have never been in fa
vor of the refunding bill. If I ever signed any
such paper I did not know its meaning.
JUST LIKE NEW WOMEN
Berkeley Co-Eds Will Not Get
Food for the Young Col
lege Men.
The Girls Decided to Let the Other
Students Provide for Them
selves.
BERKELEY, Cat,., Feb. 4.â The co-eds
of the university decided tcr-da'y after a
discussion lasting for an hour and a half
â¢to let the "student labor" brigade get
their noonday meal in the best way they
can while building the proposed new walks
and drives through the university grounds.
At least 150 girls were present when the
meeting was called to order by Miss Mil
licent Shinn, a graduate who had been
asked to preside. The co-eds talked and
talked, they passed resolutions and then
they voted them down. They became ex
cited and then they calmed down again,
they adjourned once and then came to
gether again. It was a veritable battle be
tween the graduates and the undergradu
ates, of which the former were the de
cided minority. The alumni, such as
were present, in a body upheld the
proposition to supply tne luncheon,
and the undergraduates almost to a
] single co-ed did not seem to know
which side to take, so strongly did gradu
ates uphold their end. The leading objec
tion made to the plan seemed to be that to
serve sandwiches and coffee to the denim
attired collegians would only mean the
lowering of their dignity as young lady
students, without accomplisiiing any last
ing good. They thought that it would be
much better to take the money which
would be required in order to serve the
students properly and spend it in the pur
chase or erection ot an improvement to the
campus, such as a triumphal arch for the
entrance or a stone sidewalk.
Some stated that their brothers and
cousins had said to them that they did not
want to be seen in their overalls and junip
ers, and that they would be better pleased
if the co-eds kept away while the work
was going on. The reason they voted
.down the proposition did not seem to
spring from any feeling of disloyalty, hut
from a belief in the impropriety and the
impracticability of the scheme. Finally
it was voted to appoint a committee of
five, three undergraduates and two gradu
ates, to confer witn Regent Reinstein with
the view to agreeing on some plan which
the women students would be disposed to
carry out.
Students Object.
BERKELEY, Cai,., Feb. 4.â lt is report
ed that the present college term will be
extended one week to make allowance for
the week that is to be devoted to labor on
the college grounds by students. Such a
plan meets with a good deal of opposition
among students, who are ready to do the
labor, but inclined to demur to the expense
of remaining in Berkeley an extra week.
It is argued that the "cost of so doing
would be enough to pay for the work of
improving the university grounds. The
â¢proposed extension of the term has aroused
the first opposition that has appeared
among students to doing the work out
lined by Regent Reinstein for the improve
ment of .the grounds.
The License Ordinance.
BERKELEY, Cat,., Feb. 4,â The License
Committee of the Town Trustees, consist
ing of Trustees Cripps and Hoff, held a
conference with a numbe.r of business men
at the Town Hall last night on the subject
of the recent objections to the license ordi
nance. A petition has already been pre
sented to the Trustees, asking that the
ordinance be repealed, and especially the
section relating to the licensing of vehicles.
Messrs. Cripps and Hoff heardjexpressions
of sentiment from V\\ J. Schmidt, E. F.
Gordon and Messrs. Fraser and D. Jones,
and it is to-night likely that a measure for
reduction of the license will be introduced
at the next meeting of the Town Trustees.

CLOSING THE CEMETERIES
Richmond Residents Are Divided
in Their Views on the
Matter.
A Dual Meeting Gives Each Side a
Chance to Speak â The Ordi
nance Condemned.
There was trouble at Richmond last
night about the cemetery ordinance.-
Charles H. Hubbs had called a mass
meeting at Point Lobos Hall, in the name
of the Richmond District Property-own
ers' Association, for the purpose of getting
from the residents an expression of their
approval of the new ordinance.
Mr. Hubbs called the meeting to order
and Editor Bond of the Richmond Banner
read a set of resolutions prepared by the
association. The document premised that
the cemeteries had been during the oast a
great eyesore, menace and impediment to
the advancement of Richmond district,
with their array of tombstones and barren,
desolate graves, some forsaken and un cared
for, and others impregnated with all man
ner of contamination.
The resolutions went on to give to the
Mayor and Hoard of Supervisors the assur
ance tbai the property-owners of Rich
mond heartily indorsed their action.
Then tne trouble began.
F. A. Maestretti suggested that the reso
lutions be voted upon seriatim, and not as
a whole.
Mr. Hubbs hastily submitted the motion
to the vote of the association's members
present, who carried it, despite a storm of
hoots, groans and hisses, aud. the meeting
adjourned amid great confusion.
After adjournment all present remained,
vociferating wildly, and for a time dis
order reigned. At length, Mr. Maestretti
took the chair vacated by Mr. Hubbs and
imposed silence upon the excited throng.
"I see plainly," he remarked, "that the
proceedings thus far have not met with
the approbation of a large number of those
present. Since this is the case, we had
better consider the meeting reopened."
T. B. McDonald, or "War Horse McDon
ald," as he likes to be called, then gave ex
pression to the views of his constituents.
"For weeks and months," he said, "little
groups of four or rive znon have been
meeting together here and passing resolu
tions made by themselves, which they
foisted upon the press as expressions of
Richmond opinion. The people of Rich
mond, in fact, never saw those resolutions
until they appeared in the newspapers.
"I tell you, friends, there Ireland sharks
about. They aie trying to Loom the stock
of thft San Mateo cemeteries, and they
know they can't do it until they ruin the
cemeteries here. They have an eye on the
cemeteries, too."
Editor Bond attempted to protest, but
was suppressed.
Several other sneakers then addressed
the meeting, all being on the side advo
cated by McDonald. The cheering and
cpplauaing were uproarious, but not dis
orderly.
At length Charles Dillon offered a set of
resolutions, which were adopted amid the
wildest applause, declaring that the ordi
nance in point was a menace to the prop
.erty adjacent to the cemeteries and had
been passed in the interest of corporations.
Punishment by the knout is to be donÂ©
away with in Russia.
DANIELS MUST PREPARE
The Lieutenant's Case Soon to
Come Before the Court
of Inquiry.
NEW CHARGES AGAINST HEALY.
The Captain Speaks for Himselfâ A
Mellow Witness Excused From
Testifying.
Lieutenant Georee M. Daniels, of the
United States revenue cutter Bear, is in
very hot water. As soon as the Healy
investigation. closes a long list of serious
charges agaiust the dashing young lieut
enant will be inquired into. As to the
matter of these charges little of a definite
character can be stated, as ail parties to
the affair observe the strictest silence
when questioned in relation to it. The
lieutenant himself hotly denies that
mental aberration figures among the ac
cusations against him, and is much' dis
tressed on account of a rumor to that
effect which has got abroad. When he
appeared before the court of Inquiry yes
terday as a witness against Captain Healy
his eyes weTe red and swollen as if with
weeping, and his appearance generally
seemed to indicate that he had passed a
sleepless and most unhappy night.
Dr. Bodkin, who is credited with formu
lating the charges against Daniels, is ex
ceedingly reticent on the subject.
"It is true," he said yesterday, with
great reluctance, "that several officers have
seen lit to get up a list of serious" charges
against Lieutenant Daniels, and that these
charges will come up for investigation as
soon as the Healy case concludes. Further
than this I can say nothing."
"What is the nature of the charges?"
â¢he was asked.
"That question I cannot answer," re
plied the doctor. "I am under the strict
est orders to say nothing whatever to any
one in this connection."
"But you can at least say what proced
ure will be employed, or whether any
steps have beea taken."
"No," rejoined the surgeon, "I cannot
say anything at all without exposing my
self to a reprimand. The procedure ob
served in the Daniels case will be prac
tically the same as that in the Healy in
vestigation, with the exception of certain
points of official etiquette which depend
upon the rank of the accused. Mr. Dan
iels has received notice to prepare his de
fense without delay, and must be ready to
present it as soon as the proceedings
against Captain Healy terminate. He
seems to feel rather sore about it, too."
At the Healy inquiry yesterday William
Boundy, gunner of the Bear, testified that
the captain was strict but polite with his
subordinates. The witness had frequently
heard Daniels refer to the captain as
"that old fool."
Quartermaster J. P. Peterson, also of the
Bear, said the vessel had never been in
danger through any neglect, intemperance
or incompetency on the captain's part.
When the captain was convalescing at
Unalaska, after his fall from the wharf, he
had heard DauieJs remark : "It seems good
to have the old dog out of the way, doesn't
it?"
Hugh Mcenan was to have been the next
witness, only he wasn't. He h.ad received
his pay a day or so before, and was in a
most genial though somewhat befuddled
frame of mind. On the table near the
judge-advocate are two copies of the Bible,
one of the King James version, which the
Protestant witnesses touch when being
sworn, and the other a somewhat battered
specimen ot the translation made by Eng
lish colleges of Rheims and Douay, which
serves the same purpose for the Catholics.
Each witness, before taking the oath, is
interrogated as to his religious belief, and
sworn accordingly.
Meenan did his best to stand straight,
and succeeded fairly well.
"Mr. Meenan, what is your religion?"
asked Lieutenant Reynolds.
"Able seaman, sir,'' responded the wit
ness, evidently much impressed by the
gravity of his surroundings.
"Not your position, but your religion,"
explained the judge-advocate.
"Ain't I after telling you?" rejoined the
witness, considerably nettled.
Both sides put their heads together and
decided that the testimony of Meenan,
though likely to prove interesting, could
be dispensed with.
"You are excused, Mr. Meenan," said
the judge-advocate blandly.
"No, sir," exclaimed the jolly tar in
great excitement, "I've been at sea for
twenty-five years, and I'm not to be run
out in this fashion."
* '"You seem to be somewhat at sea now,"
commented Reynolds, grimly, and at his
command the witness was gently but
effectually "run out" into the corridor.
Harry Smith, coxswain of the Bear, tes
tified to the captain's strictness, courtesy
and impartiality with the officers. He had
seen him intoxicated at Unalaska, at sea
and at Sansalito.
Robert Wilson, a seaman aboard the
Bear, when asked as to the captain's al
leged intemperate habits, positively re
fused to answer.
"I have a wife and family dependent
upon roe," he explained, ''and 1 don't
want to lose my place. The other day
Engineer Van Zandt testified in the cap
tain's favor and was discharged for doing
so, and I will not share his fate," and this
was all that anybody could get out of Mr.
Wilson.
Quartermaster William F. Quintall tes
tified that he had been wirh Captain
Healy three years, and found him* uni
formly kind, but just even to rigor.
. At the opening of the afternoon session
Frederick Arnold, a seaman, gave testi
mony identical with that of Quintall.
Captain Healy then took the stand in
his own behalf, and made his statement
in a most dignified and impressive man
ner.
"I deny," he said, "that I was intoxi
cated on the days mentioned in the com
plaint. As to the Gray episode, the. offi
cers had complained to me that Gray had
slighted them in an unpardonable fashion,
and I took their part. I called Gray to
task for what I thought to be his shabby
treatment of my men, and referred him to
Messrs. Daniels & Co. for further particu
lars. The officers refused to make any ex
planation, though their complaints alone
had made me ask Gray to explain his
conduct.
"When I found that my own men were
evidently endeavoring to make a fool of
me I was much incensed and utterly dis
gusted. I left them to fix things with Mr,
Gray as best they could, and retired to my
cabin. Since then Mr. Gray and I have
come to an understanding, and are now
as fast friends as before.
"All the way from Sitka to Unalaska,"
pursued the captain, "I was under Dr.
Bodkin's care, and suffered considerable
from la grippe. But I did not allow the
vessel to suffer by reason of my illness,
and frequently in direct contravention of
the doctor's orders I have gone on deck
when I thought my presence necessary
for the preservation of order or for the
proper management of the cutter. I did
not neclect my duty during that period,
nor have I done so during all my years in
the service of my country."
Lieutenant Daniels was called in re
buttal. He reiterated all his former state
ments against his superior, and denied
having endeavored to influence the testi
mony of the two Japanese cabin-boys.
Here the taking of evidence on the third
set of charges, ceased and the remaining
accusations were taken up. These in
clude charges of drunkenness at sea during
the months of June and August, 1895, in
civility to officers, the shipping of desert
ers and discharged seamen and the per
mitting of incomplete entries in the cut
ter's log. The last charge refers to an i
occasion when the captain had placed
Lieutenant White under- arrest for some
violation of discipline. Later, when
White, having been released from incar
ceration, was writing up the logbook, the
captain told him he might omit any refer
ence to his arrest if he desired it" not to
appear on record. White left out the entry
and afterward spoke of the fact, thus giv
ing color to the charge against his com
mander of keeping incomplete records.
Lieutenant Daniels was the first to take
the stand against his commander. He
said that during the months of June and
August, 1895, the captain was almost con
stantly under the influence of liquor to
such an extent as to be incapable or man
aging the vessel, which several times was
in grave danger from rocks and icebergs.
Tbo captain's intoxication was, he alleged,
so marked and continual that he and Lieu-,
tenant Buhner had on one occasion
thought best to remove all the liquor from
their superior's cabin. What was done
with the liquor the witness did not state.
On cross-examination he claimed that the
captain's condition was unmistakably due
to excessive drinking,
A large number of witnesses have still
to be examined, and the judge-advocate
seems inclined to hold evening session"
during the remainder of the inquiry. The
idea, however, meets with little favor from
the younger officers, who have become
quite popular in a social way, and resent
any intrusion upon their "evenings otit."
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Terrible Experience of the Crew
of the British Ship
Nineveh.
The Vessel Was Water-Logged and
Sinking Fast When the Boats
Were Manned.
The schooner Compeer arrived from New
Whatcom yesterday with the crew of the
British ship Nineveh on board. They
were picked up south of Cape Flattery,
having deserted the vessel, which was in
a sinking condition. Afterward the
wreck being a menace to navigation was
set on tire, and it was the Nineveh
which was reported on Puget Sound
as burned to the water's edge a few
days ago. The rescued men are as fol
lows: Captain Robert Bruafoot, Robert
M. Reader, first officer; W. Evelyn, second
officer; S. Davidson, carpenter; F. Leigh,
steward; W. Frampton, cook; James
Ringwood, A k McGllvery, W. Leonard, L.
Woodruff, C. Olsen, A. Olsen, B. Pris, C.
Cryeth, J. Thomas, Otto Riause, B. Row
lan, A. Arptune, D. Darkston and D.
Stewart, seamen.
The Nineveh sailed from Moodyville on
January 13 last with 840,000 feet of lumber
aboard *for Sydney, N. S. W. In his report
the captain says:
On Friday, January 24, we lelt Olallam Bay,
and passed Cape Flattery at 3:30 p. m. with a
strong northeast wind and a falling glass. The
ship was under upper topsails and lower main
topsails.
At Bp. M. the wind bauled southeast tnd
freshened co a heavy gale. Roused all hands
and shortened sail, heaving ship to under
lower main-topsails.
Saturday, January 25, it was blowing a per
fect hurricane with a mountainous sea break
ing heavily over the ship, shifting the deck
cargo on starboard side, starting all the
stanchions and causing the ship to leak badly.
All hands were kept at the pumps, but could
not keep the water under control, there being
five feet of water in the hold.
At noon the wind seemed to take a fresh
lease of its strength and blew with unabated
fury, the seas having no mercy wnen they
broke. One sea in particular swept the snip
fore and aft, the heaviest part breaking clean
over the men at the pumps, shifting deck cargo
considerably and breaking the pump-handle
and also injuring four of the men. One had
his forehead severely cut and the others were
jammed in the timber; but in spite of all they
clung to the pumps as the-y would to life,
cheered by the much-esteemed chief officer,
who with the crew never fliuched from his
duty.
The steam was then got up and connected to
the pumps. The crew came aft to see what the
captain would do, and, was told he would try
and get to Cape Flattery, and at 4 p. m. wore
ship. Later on in the evening the wind headed
us and our last resort was to tire up rockets
with the hope of a ship seeing our signal.
Sunday, the 26th, at 8 o'clock, after firing up
rockets all night, daylight broke with a
schooner in sight, port bow on port tack. The
crew came aft for a second time and asked the
captain to signal for assistance, which was
done, and the schooner hove to under our lee
and at once we got' starboard boat over, when
crew got in and left the ship under three lower
topsails and one aback, and pulled to the
schooner Compeer of San Francisco, and bound
lor that port. We were received on

The Secretary and Controller of
the Southern Pacific Is
No More.
END OF A BRILLIANT CAREER.
Nervous Prostration From Overappli
cation in the Railway's Cause
Kills Him.
G. L. Lansing, secretary and controller
of the Southern Pacific Company, died at
his home, 1935 Pacific avenue, yesterday
morning. The immediate cause of his
death was a hemorrhage, whicn, however,
resulted from the complete shattering of
his health consequent upon many years of
wearying work, which included various
matters of policy and the trying fights of
the railway corporation against the people.
Mr. Lansing's last efforts were made
during the investigation of the Southern
Pacific's California freights by the Railroad
Commissioners, and after that he was com
pelled to go home for rest and recupera
tion. It was against the advice of friends
and his physicians that he persisted in
THE LATE G. L. LANSING.
[From a photograph by Taber.]
overworking himself, and nervous pros
tration followed. His colleagues say that
Mr. Lansing broke down at the Railroad
Commission trial. A few days before his
death he began to recover and was re
garded as being convalescent, when at
tacked by a hemorrhage which carried him
off suddenly, so the news of his passing
away was a shock to the railway officials.
Mr. Lansing was born in Detroit, Mich.,
April 22, 1850. He was educated in the
Norhwestern University of Illinois. In
1869 he entered the railway service, and
since that lime has been consecutively
clerk and chief clerk in the general aud
itor's office of the Central Pacific Com
pany, from 1885 to 18S7 assistant con
troller of the Southern Pacific Company,
and on January 12, ISBB, was promoted to
the important position of secretaiy and
controller of the Southern Pacific, which
he held to the last. He worked his way to
the top in twenty - six years, learning
every minute detail and attaining full
mastery of the railroad's executive depart
ments. While in the office of Â£. H. Miller,
the secretary of the Central Pacific when
that company operated the other lines
under a lease, he was educated in the
finer points of railroading. When the
Railroad Employes' Mutual Benefit Asso
ciation was organized, May 8, 3880, he was
elected its first secretary ; and he was also
the first secretary of the Southern Pacific
upon its organization.
In the light of his ability and accom
plishments as a railroad man Mr. Lansing
stood with the leading railway officials of
America. A forcible and convincing
writer, he contributed largely to railway
literature. Numerous railway articles,
presenting powerful arguments for the
railroad's side, and some excellent treatises
on the subject of justice to railways
against the popular demand for relief from
railroad exactions came from his pen.
Among the pamphlets left by him are
"The Right of the Railroad to Reasonable
Rates," read before the Chit-Chat Club in
December, 1893; "The Central Pacific Rail
t way Company in Account With the United
States ; the "fb/urman Act a Final Settle
ment," published in December, 1889, and
"Relations Between the Central Pacific
Railroad Company and the United States
Government; Snmrnary of Facts." This
last production was brought out by a let
ter from Senator Stanford, the president
of the company, requesting Mr. Lansing to
outline the situation as to the relation Be
tween the Central Pacific and the United
States. All Mr. Lansing's books were re
garded by railway men as standard works
and can be found in railway libraries
throughout the country.
Mr. Lansing was highly esteemed by the
Southern Paciiic Railway officials for his
rare abilities and his courteous deportment
toward ail Derson3 with whom he came in
contact. It is said of him that although
he was genial as a rule he ottered no
quarter to any one whom he suspected of
irregular acts. By many of his associates
he was supposed to have been of a retiring
and uncongenial disposition, but those
who knew him best knew also that beyond
the actual work demanded by duty his
thought for years dwelt upon science and
other serious considerations of the
scholar. He was a man of deep and
wide knowledge, and like the scholar
was always above parading it in pub
lic. His favorite study was natural
history, and in particular ornithology,
which bent of his gave the Academy of
. Sciences many specimens of local birds,
truthfully mounted and preserved for
stuay. He joined the academy shortly
after coming to San Francisco, and for
years alter in his trips through the coun
try shot and preserved many birds. He
was not a member of any fraternal society.

AN AGREED CASE.
Ownership of Buildings Erected on
Leased School Lots, Corner
Market and Fifth Streets.
An agreed case between the Board of
Education and certain tenants on land be
longing to the School Department has
been submitted to the Superior Court for
decision. In 1874 the school lots on the
corner of Market and Fifth streets were
leased for a period of twenty years. The'
question now involved is whether the im
provements made by tenants on the
premises, such as the buildings erected,
etc., belong to the public as school prop
erty or belong to the parties who .teased
the land.
Since the termination of the twenty
yea;s' lease, the lessees have been renting
from month to month at the same rental
that was paid during the last five years of
the lease. None of the buildings erected
have been purchased by the City, and no
attempt has been made to purchase or
pay for them.

William Mills Jr. of Eureka, Humboldt
County, swore out warrants in Judge
Joachimsen's court yesterday for the ar
rest of four young men, known as "Bui
Fogarty, "Silver" Coyne, John Burke and
John Lacy, on the charge of robbery.
Mills is the son of WÂ» H. Mills, a wealthy
contractor and architect in Eureka. He
has Deen employed in this City as a car
penter and lives at 8 Oakwood street. He
was walking along Eighteenth street Mon
day night when the lour young men as
saulted him. He was knocked down by a
blow on the head, and one of tnem went
through his pockets. He had only 10
cents, which they took from him, and, ex
asperated at the small amount, they kicked
him several times.
The four young footpads are well known
as hard customers in the Mission.
AN EARLY SHOWING.
Some of the Dainty Wash Fabrics for the
Leap Year Summer Girl.
The frost-bitten, snow-bound denizens
of the large Eastern cities would think
that a merchant who displayed summer
shirt waists and wash fabrics at this season
of the year was out of his mind, but here
in San Francisco it is taken as a matter of
course to buy dainty dimities and percales
in midwinter.
Early last, week Kohlberg, Strauss &
Frohman made the first display of new
summer wash fabrics â lovely imported
dimities and percales and an entirely new
cotton weave called Batiste Brode, which
the manufacturers thinfc will be the most
popular cotton dress fabric of the year.
In another department of the Post-street
store the busy salesfolk were, when The
Call representative stepped in, marking
great stacks of shirt waists for the 1896
summer girlâ shirt waists with immense
sleeves, whose "bigness" extended away
down to the cuff instead of stopping at the
elbow and falling in folds, as they did last
year. Throngs of women clustered around
these new goods and evidently believed in
"taking time when time is," lor they
bought liberally of what they deemed the
j prettiest patterns and styles. Perhaps
they don't intend to wear these pretty
summer littings for two or three months,
but they certainly had a first choice of a
charming stock.
There was a wonderfully good glove be
ing sold at another counter for 75 cents a
pairâ and probably they are not all gone
yetâ a lovely eight-button length Mousque
taire, just as well made and Handsome as
many a pair that cost $1 50 or more. The
ribbon counter appeared to be a moat
attractive part of the store. This house
has on display dozens and dozens of bolts
of the beautiful new warp print ribbons.
The patterns are printed in brilliant colors
on the warp of the ribbon, before the weav
ing is completed, producing an effect when
the ribbon is finished indescribably soft
and rich. They are # undoubtediy the love
liest neck and bonnet ribbons ever made,
being so pretty that they almost niake the
plain woman look charming.
There is no excuse for any woman not
owning two or throe pretty evening waists,
when wash-siiks.tbat are by the w ay all silk
can be had for 25 cents a yard, including
any num ber of pretty patterns and colors
to suit all complexious. The newest dress
silks, however, received by this firm are
heavy black brocaded grosgrained with
odd patterns in the warp print effect at
â¢f 110 and $1 75 per yard. The saleslady
eaid "they almost stand alone and the
wrinules shake out of them readily."
No dry goods emporium of the largest
Eastern cities show more designs of the
latest novelties than the leading establish
ments of this City, of which Kohlberg,
Strauss & Frohma'n is one of the best ex
amples.
Rev. J. B. Orr Called.
The Park Congregational Church, located
near the panhandle of Golden Gate Park, has a
new pastor, who will take up the work laid
down by the Rev. Cruznn, who went to Olivet
Church. The new pastor is James B. Orr, the
well known Congregational evangelist.
The triangular bridge at Crowland, in
Lincolnshire, which was probably -in
tended as an emblem of the Trinity ,*is the
most ancient Gotnic structure remaining
entire in the kingdom. It was erected
about the year of our Lord 860.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5. 1896.
DR. McLEAN'S MEMORIAL
The Arguments That Will Be
Used Regarding the Tidal
Canal.
FOR TWO APPROPRIATIONS.
Probability That Money Enough May
Be Obtained to Cover Both of
Oakland's Projects.
The conflicting interests of the two fac
tions now engaged in the promotion of the
Oakland Harbor improvement projects
jlive promise that a more thorough hear
ing will be obtained in Congress this year
than ever before, and it is anticipated that
a jrenerous appropriation will be the result.
There is no opposition on the part ol
anybody except the railroad people to any
part of the Oakland harbor work, the
present dispute being merely as to what
work shall be done first.
Ex-Congressman Warren B. English,
who worked valiantly and successfully for
the harbor appropriations while in Con
gress, is now at the head of the Oakland
custom- house, and so he is specially inter
ested in having the estuary dredged out so
that ships of any draeht can reach Oak
land. He is ureing the immediate dredg
ing of the lower harbor to give his city the
full commercial advantage of its location
on the bay, and associated with him are all
the business men who would be directly
benefited by immediate improvement "of
the transportation facilities.
The people who are concerned more di
rectly about the sanitary improvement are
urging that the proposed tidal canal be cut
through during the coming year. These
are led by Dr. J. T. MeLean, who, as
already announced in The Call, has gone
to Washington in the interest of the meas
ure. On the side of the Health Officer are
the business men and residents of Alamed3,
Fruitvale and that part of Oakland which
borders on the upper portion of the har
bor and surrounds Lake Merritt; and the
yachtsmen also take a great interest in the
canal project.
The reasons for wanting to have the
canal completed are embodied in the me
morial which Dr. McLean has taken to
"Washington. This memorial is as follows,
though some of the signatures have been
revoked so as not to antagonize the effort
to have the dredging in the lower harbor
continued.
A PLEA
Of One Hundred Thousand People.
Based ok Important Sanitary and Economic
Reasons, foe the Speedy Completion
of Oakland Habbok.
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Rep
resentatives, in Congress Assembled: Your memo
rialists, the Board of Trustees, the Board of
Health and the Board of Education of the city
of Alamed.a; the Mayor and City Council, the
Board of Public Works, the Board of Health
and Board of Education of the city of Oakland,
and the president and secretary of Fruitvale
sanitary districts Nos. 1 and 2, State of Cali
fornia, would respectfully represent:
That the United States has in course of con
struction a public work, known as Oakland
harbor, extending from deep water in the bay
of San Francisco easterly into the bay of San
Leandro, and comprising in its entirety a jetty
system in the bay of San Francisco, the es
tuary of San Antonio, with its lines re-formed
and its depth increased, a tidal canal, to be dug
to a depth of eight feet below low water,
through the isthmus between the said estuary
and the bay of ban Leandro, and a dam and
automatic floodgate to be constructed at the
point where the bay of San Leandro now
empties into the bay of San Francisco; this
floodgate to shut automatically, at every high
tide, and thus force all the tidal water flowing
out of San Leandro Bay. on each ebb tide,
trough the tidal canal and estuary and the
jetties into the bay of San Francisco.
That the part of this harbor represented by
the eastern portion of tire jetty system, the
estuary of San Antonio and the tidal canal
are located between the city of Oakland and
Fruitvale sanitary districts Nos. 1 and 2 and
North Alameda on the north and the city of
Alameda on the south, the bay of San Leandro
being located on the east of Fruitvale sanitary
district No. 1 and the city of Alameda; these
cities and sanitary districts representing a
population in round numbers of 100,000.
That the sewage of the southern half of the
City of Oakland and the northern half of the
city of Alameda, as well as the waste from tan
neries, gas-works, cotton-mills end other man
uiacturing establishments located on the estu
ary (some of which is very offensive) is dis
charged Into the estuary of San Antonio; that
the sewage of Fruitvale BB.nitary districts Nos.
1 and 2, including North Alameda, empties
Into the eastern and western portions of the
tidal canal; that the sewage of the town of
San Leandro, as well as that of the northern
half of the city of Alameda, empties into the
bay of San Leandro.
That these various sewer systems have been
planned and constructed to empty, as above
stated, into these various parts of Oakland har
bor on the supposition that said harbor would
be completed within a reasonable time, -and
that by the flow and reflow of the tides twice
daily back and forth through the various parts
of the harbor all the waters composing it
would be thoroughly changed and that each
ebb tide would carry out of the harbor into
San Francisco Bay, and thence through the
Golden Gate into the Pacific Ocean, so much of
the sewatce-ladened water in it as to make said
harbor a proper receptacle for and an efficient
means for carrying off the sewage of the 100 -
000 people living adjacent to it.
That the National Congress by act approved
March 3, 1873, directed the Secretary of War to
cause examinations or surveys or both to be
made and a plan devised for the construction
of Oakland harbor; that Colonels Alexander
Stewart and Mendell were constituted & Board
of United States Engineers under the act to
make the examinations and surveys and to de
vise the plan for the harbor; that this plan then
devised was approved and adopted by the Sec
retary of War, and between the years 1874 and
1894 inclusive fourteen appropriations
amounting in gross to $1,784,000, have been
made by Congress and expended under the su
porvision of United States engineers in the
construction of the harbor.
That it is estimated by the United States en
giueers that appropriations amounting to
$1,000,000 are yet necessary to complete it.
That it is the opinion of the United States en
gineers who have had charge of the construc
tion of this harbor that fully 40 per cent of the
$1,784,600 thus far expended on It, say $700
-0-000, have been devoted to dredging between the
jetties in the estuary and in the eastern and
western portions of the tidal canal, and that
from 15 per cent to 20 per cent of this $700
-0-000, say $140,000, would have been saved in
dredging if the tidal canal between San Lean
dro Bay and the estuary of San Antonio and
the dam and automatic floodgate, shutting up
at each high tide San Leandro Bay at its open
ing into San Francisco Bay, had been con
structed after the jetties had been completedâ
the resultof the construction of the tidal canal
and floodgate in the early history of building
the harbor being a vast amount of scouring
and dredging by the natural procession of tne
tides to and fro twice .daily through that part
of the harbor between the bays of San Fran
cisco and San Leandro. The engineers in
charge of this work inform us that
165,000,000 of cubic feet of tidal water
will pass at each ebb of the tide,
or twice daily (this being the measurement of
the tidal water in San Leandro Bay), between
Saa Leanciro Bay &ad the bay of. San Fr&a-
Cisco, through the various parts of Oakland
harbor intermediate between these two bay*.
From the lack of tnis natural scouring and
dredging very considerable deposits of mud
and silt and gravel have been made in later
years which obstruct navigation in the estu
ary, where it has been made possible by pre
vious artificial dredging; and like deposits
have been made in the eastern and western
parts of the tidal canal, which have heretofore
been dredged to the depth required by the
plans of the harbor.
In view of these facts it can readily be be
lieved that a large amount of dredging and a
great consequent expense will be saved, as
well as a great sanitary advantage gained, by
the early completion ot the tidal canal and
floodgate, with the resulting full and free in
terchange of the waters of the harbor into
which the sewage of the 100,000 people above
named is discharged.
To the end that the tidal canal and floodgate
may be completed, and this great expense of
dredging and most desirable improvement in
the sanitary condition of 100,000 people be
accomplished, the undersigned, representing
these people and aware of their sanitary needs,
respectfully ask that an appropriation of
$500,000 be made at this session of Congress
to complete the tidal canal ai\d floodgate; and
that it be specifically applied, in the terms of
the river and harbor appropriation bill, to
these special parts of Oakland harbor. We
are informed by Colonel Mendell, United States
Civil Engineer, lately in charge of construc
tion of Oakland harbor, that this sum will
complete and bridge the tidal canal and con
struct the dam and floodgate.
If it is found to be impossible to secure an
appropriation of the above named amount
then tne undersigned would urge that as large
an appropriation .as is possible be made for
this harbor, and that, by the terms of the ap
propriation bill, tne amount appropriated
be directed to be expended in building the
tidal canal in said harbor.
And your petitioners will ever pray, etc.

D.r. McLean will urge that the tidal
canal be dredged out and others will work
for the lower harbor improvements, and it
is quite possible that both parties will be
successful and that a specific appropria
tion will be made for each work. Accord
ing to the experts about $300 000 coula pron^
tably be expended in dredging the Oakland
Creek and about $150,000 ought to be used
on the tidal canal.
California has not fared even as well as
Oregon in the matter of appropriations,
they assert, and it would not be surprising
if $500,000 at least should be obtained from
the present Congress to carry on the Oak
iaud-harbor dredging.
THE BICYCLE ORDINANCE
Orders Will Soon Be Issued to En-
force the Measure to the

The bicycle ordinance recently passed
by the Board of- Supervisors seems to be

few arrests under the new measure, orders
will shortly be issued to enforce the ordi
nance to the letter.

On Trial for Arson.
Mrs. Eugenia Schuller, charged with arson,
was on trial before Judge Bahrs yesterday!
Her house was mysteriously burned on Decem
ber 6 last. There had been eight previous fires,
and the last was found to have originated in a
pile of shavings soaked in benzine and some
dry kindling-wood. The insurance on the
property was $6000. The benzine and shavings
are all in as evidence.
Masonic Lecture.
The W.E. Smith delivered an interest

evening some pleasing instrumental and vocal
music was rendered.
BARBARISMS OF THE TIME
Frank J. Murasky Delivers an
Eloquent Lecture in the
Temple.
CATHOLIC CHURCH'S POSITION.
The Speaker Asks Wliat Better Insti
tution to Effect the Evolution
of Society.
The audience at last night's meeting of
the Catholic reading circles in Metropoli
tan Temple was entertained by the Hon.
Frank Murasky, who iv an eloquent and
really scholarly lecture on "The Bar
barisms of the Nineteenth Century" ac-'
quitted himself of a splendid effort. The
speaker was warmly applauded at the
more interesting points in his lecture.
The hall was crowded, and as on former
meetings of the Catholic society last week,
enthusiasm was cordial, and certainly a
gratifying sign of approval of the lecturer's
words.
The speaker claimed that the truth
about the syndicates of the present, if
presented in its full seriousness, would
Frank J. Murasky, Who Lectured Last Evening at Metropolitan Temple on
" Modern Barbarisms."
[Reproduced from a photograph.]
prove the members of these compacts were
barbarians â were gamblers. They gam
bled in the profits to be made by their
illegitimate business. It was a barbarism
opposed to all Christian teaching, against
everything that Christ taught upon earth.
Here in California people, he said, were
too far away from the struggling millions
to feel tne effect pf this barbarism. Here
where man is close to the tirst turning of
the soil, to the new life, this terrible strug
gle could not be felt. He continued :
Another imperfection in the present system
is the abuse ot the rule that only tne tiuest
should survive. This accounts for the slums,
for ignorance and poverty, for, weak minds.
The doctrine of survival of the fittest cannot
survive under the old regime. If a man be
tied to agrinding occupation for life it is because
he is not fitted for a better employment. A
collier whose life is crushed out in the mine is
said to have been unfit; but nature made him
nt for better, the system of the time did not.
In the great centers of population, in Lon
don, New York and here, lull many a gem is
left to pass uuseen. Though the ruleis wrongly
applied, ''hat the fittest should survive, men
should be placed on an equal basis. . Look at
the history of the human race; it is one long
story of wrong from man to man. In the old
days the slaves were made by the sword, Now
he is made by the circumstances that force him
to toil.
Looking at a few features of the present
day Mr. jA-urasky read a newspaper de
scription of the houses and treatment of
slaves in the Kimberley mines, and the
speaker declared :
That is a cage for a wild animal, and yet to
day they are confined in that cage voluntary
human prisoners. They work iv the mines at
day and pass to this cage at night through a
tunnel ; they are not allowed to hold converse
with the outside world. These men have
bound themselves by voluntary contract. The
western system came along and compelled
these same men to earn their living, bur, not
without these conditions. That is tne barbar
ism of it.
There must be some necessity of life that
compels these men to live as slaves, and what
Is it ? That a few men and women might
wear brilliantsâ that a few men and womea
might wear diamonds on their shirt bosoms.
That is a picture while iv a perfected civiliza
tion could not exist.
The lecturer went on to tell of the ef
fects of present conditions on English peo
ple. Taking Bradford, the cotton manu
facturing town in Yorkshire, whore men
and women know little more than the
loom, and even now can wear only wooden
clogs, he said that hundreds of cripples
are foundâ all the result of injustice, in
humanity of man to man. If the woman
of the Blums is not held in as h'gh esteem
as the woman of the four hundred, this is
one of the worst barbarisms of this time.
The faults iv the system exist because
men permit them to be so. Men make
the world what it is without an effort to
make it what it should be. Men need to
understand better and to observe the com
mandment, "Do unto others as men should
do unto yon." This is the doctrjne by
which man's injustice to man shall be
blotted out.
But the world is working forward; it
will in time change those conditions which
make the unfortunate individual the vic
tim of his more lucky neighbors. More
and more each day men are feeling their
common origin, and they will realize that
the aristocracy of learning, like other casts,
will disappear in the great democracy of
ininds which a fully developed Christian
civilization will bring about. Through its'
tragedies, its miseries and its injustices
the human race is passing to a better
state. In this evolution, in which so
many myriads have taken part, men can
do their share of the work by appreciating
better the condition and respecting more
the sacred, inalienable rights of those
about them, by obliterating in God-made
resemblance all man-made distinctions.
He continued:
What better institution to carry forward the
evolution of society than the Catholic church?
It is the expression in living form of Christ's
gospel. It was founded to carry into effect
Christ's teachings. Its mission Is to inspire
man with that love for his neighbor that
Christ preached. Its ministers, by long train
ing, by years of inculcation, by the example of
their predecessors, by command of God him
self, are imbued with the ambition to carry
messages of peace and Rood will to all men. In
the fulfillment of their mission they have left
untrod no foot of this t-arth's surface where
man dwells. They are the companions
o! lepers, tiie comforters of the wounded,
the consolers of the dying In every land. No
battlefield has ever been too bloody, no hospi
tal too pestilential for their ministrations. No
tie of family, of home life, of friendship, no
association with society has ever been strong
enough to keep them from the bedside oi the
sick. Their blood- mingles with the dust in
every quarter of the earth. The gospel of
Christ has come down to us through nineteen
centuries wetted with the blood-of their mar
tyrdom.
T.he faith which inspired these men, which
teaches self-sacrifice, which commands.charity,
which loves peace is an element which cannot
be other than a mighty influence for the bet
terment of the human race. .
At the close of the lecture Father Byrne
announced that an open meeting of the
reading circles would be held this evening.
JAMES LICK'S MEMORY.
A. Proposition to Kreci a Monument to
It in Golden Gate Park.
At the meeting of the Pioneers on last
Monday Charles M. Plum, at one time
one of the Lick trustees, offered a resolu
tion to the effect that it was the sense of
the meeting that a statue of or monument
in memory of James Lick be placed in
Golden Gate Park. Before the question
was put to a vote the mover requested that
it be postponed until the first Monday in
March.
The proposition that there should be a
monument to the memory of the great
philanthrophist was argued a few weeks
since in an informal way by some of ihe
members of the Society of California
Pioneers, and it was suggested that it
should be erected in front of the Pioneer
building, but as tiie djscussion became
more general, it was suggested that it
ought to be in the park, where a greater
number oi people might see it.
It is expected that others who have been
benefited by the liberality of James Lick
will ioin in the movement, and possibly
an effort will be made to have it erected
through a popular subscription.
For the Youths' Directory.
Secretary Kane of the Pacific Coast Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in
creased the number of inmates of the Youths'
Directory by two yesterday. One was the baby
boy of Mr. and Mrs. Russell Mitchell, Chestnut
place. Thfc mother, a dissipated woman, de
serted the child about a week ago and the
father, a longshoreman, was arrested on Mon
day in a drunken condition. The baby, half
naked and dirty, was found on the sidewalk in
front of the house by some neighbors, ,and was
taken to the City Prison by Policeman Fan
ning. The other was Frank Tracy, the news
boy, who played a confidence game on resi
dents of Turk street last Friday by telling them
he was an orphan from New York. His parents
live at 74 Clementina street.

Gentlemen: One bo.t of No-To-Bac cured me of
the tobacco habit, both smoking and chewing, after
having used the weed for nearly . forty years. My '
â¢ health is much better, nerves stronar and steady,
and I have gained over forty pounds- in flesh. I
have 'recommended. No-To-Bac to 'some of-my
friends, all of whom have been cured. - I lirmly be-
lieve that Xo-To-Bac will do for others what it has
done for me. : 1 heartily recommend it to all those
who have become slaves to the use of tobacco and
desire to be emancipated. "..*â

NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 4.-\Vall street oper
ators to-day took a more cheerful view of the sit
uation than for some time. The news from reliable
sources that the Government loan will be largely
over subscribed, and that, too, at prices considera
bly above those named by the Morgan syndicate,
Imparted greater confidence in financial circles
and led to free buying of securities." In addition to
this, there was. the highly encouraging report of
the St. Paul road for the fourth week of January,
â¢bowing an increase in earnings of $160,000 as
compared with 1895.
The Rock Island statement, with: its gain of
nearly f 58.000 for the month of January, was also
better than expected. As exchange continues to
rule" at about. the low rates current yesterday, and
the indications are that considerable gold would be
imixmea to pay for foreign subscriptions to the
Government loau, the bulls had pretty much every
thing their own way. That the market has great
Inherent strength was plainly attested the way

CHICAGO, ; IliÂ», Feb The wheat market ex
. hlblted a change in apoearance this mornius from
that seen yesterday.'; 1 There was < not so much, de
termination to buy, and as prices opened at a loss
of from â¢lc- to 1 3/sC " from the close of ', yesterday,
' those who were holding wheat, taken on at the top
yesterday, were feeling uneasy over the situation,
and displayed an inclination to let go at a sacrifice.
The decline over night was | variously ascribed to
the large Northwestern receipts, 664 cars against
406 last Tuesday and 195 a year ago., to private
cables from Liverpool' reporting an" early advance
at that place lost, and to a reported heavy move
ment of wheat from the Northwest to : Chicago,
Armour beine'given as the owner of the property.
The world's shipments for .week were : moder
ate at 4,782.000 bushels. Receipts at Chicago were'
107 cars, and 550,000 bushels were. withdrawn
from store. â¢'.'â¢'â  'â ' â  ' â

CORNâ Opened weak and ruled easy. 4 There was
no encouragement whatever | for buyers, even the
supporting factor of the recent pastâ the strength
of wheatâ being absent. Trading was restricted
and no feature -developed. Receipts were 329 cars
and 9496 bushels . were taken from store. Liver
pool cables were firm. Export clearances were
very large at P06.656 bushÂ«-Is. M*y corn opened

In theChollar mine, in the 1 stopes. above- No. 2
crosscut and the south drift from it on the 450-foot
level, they have been opening to the north on the
fourth floor and skirting on the west side of the old
stope on the sixth floor, both , points showing,
bunches of pay ore, which, after assorting, is saved.
In the north drfft from the old stope on this level
they have run a west crosscut to the old workings,
finding nothing of value. They extracted -durins
the past weeic seventy-three tons and â¢ 1900 pounds
of ore, which was shipped to .he Nevada mill for
reduction. The average battery sample was $25 62
per ton. â¢ â 
In the Potosi mine in the stope above the north
drift from the east crosscut, 550 level, they are ex
tracting ore from the twelfth and thirteenth floors,
both from .the fillings and | a> small streak in place
on the east wall. On the 450 level, at the point of
connection wi;h the stope below, they have put ill
five square sets in length, preparatory to raising.
The slope at this point is yielding finings of fair
grade. They extracted' from both places during
the week 199 tons and 1500 pounds of ore. which
was shipped to the Nevada mill for reduction, the
average battery sample of which was $26 70 per
ton. The usual necessary repairs are in progress.
They shipped to the San Francisco office during
the week two bars of bullion of the par value of
$4136 46.
Bit i is reported that the clean-up of bullion from
the recent crushing of Hale & Norcross ore at the
. Brunswick mill will give bullion of the par value
of about $29,000, and that after all expenses have
been deducted the company will net about $18,000
In gold coin on the. run, which will enable It to
square up all bills and will leave a large surplus In

WRECKED AN
OAKLAND STORE
A Successful Safe-Robbery
Perpetrated Early Yes
terday Morning.
NITRO-GLYCERINE USED.
Frank R. Girard's Place of
Business Partially De
molished.
IN CENTRAL BANK BUILDING.
The Operations Were in the Heart of
the City, but the Burglars Were
Not Disturbed.
Oakland Omen San Francibco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 4. J
A heavy safe was wrecked and pieces
weighing thirty pounds were hurled fifty
feet, a glass office was demolished, a piano
was blown to pieces and three other
pianos were badly injured by an explosion
of nitro-glycerine this morning in the rear
of Prank Girard's piano-store in the Cen
tral Bank building. The work was done
by safe-crackers, who secured money and
jewelry worth about $1300 and committed
damage to the amount of about $1000.
The most remarkable element in the
affair is that although three policemen
were on duty within two blocks of the
scene of the robbery, and although the
City Prison is only one block away no one
heard the explosion, which experts say
must have been audible for lour blocks.
From the accounts of the janitor, who
slept in the building, and of the watch
man at the narrow-gauge depot, which is
across the street from the bank building, it
is clear that there were two explosions. The
safe-crackers evidently blew "open the safe
at 3:30 o'clock this morning and returned
at G o'clock, blew open a little iron box in
an inner corner of the safe and took all
that it contained. After applying the
fuse they doubtless took themselves
off to await developments. Two hours
after the explosion, as nobody seemed to
have been disturbed, they entered and
completed the work of .vreckage and pil
lage and went away unmolested. ** -
The burglars entered from the rear.
Back of the building is a small courtyard
or area way, flanked on three sides by the
walls of the building, and on the fourth by
a twenty-foot wall facing on a vacant lot.
To scale this wall, the burglars took a lad
der belonging to H. C. Bradley, a pain ler
whofe chop on Fifteenth street backs up
on the empty lot at the rear ot the burg
larized store. The ladder had been chained
to the side ol the paintshop, but with a
jimmy the padlock which held it was
forced. The burglars then placed it
against the wall which leads into the area
way back of Girard's place.
Oq the inside of the wall the workmen
,had placed an old set of stairway 4 and on
â¢ this the cracksmen came down. There
was one of the cellar doors open and they
entered. The only outlet besides the door
through which they came in was a heavy
wooden door, barred by a scantling.
The burglars pried the door open. Marks
of a jimmy show that this instrument was
used, and a broken mason's spirit level
that, this was also used as a lever.
In this basement is Lund's workshop, and
while one of the burglars took a small
hammer and a large circular file the other
ran upstairs, pressed the key of the ca6h
register and extracted $13 50 which had
been left by the proprietor.
The window in the basement tinder the
store must have been left opened or un
locked and was easily raised. Stairs lead
from the basement into the store, and the
office -door was unlocked. There is no
lrght left burning in the office, and it is so
far from ths front of the store aud the
view so obstructed that it is almost impos
sible to discern anything from the street.
This fact was evidently appreciated by the
burglars, for before trying their hand on
the safe they pried open every drawer and
looked over every book and paper, and
even took a half dozen cigars that were in
the proprietor's desk.
The wreck was of such proportions and
so complete that theories as to how it was
done are not borne out by any evidence.
The job was a desperate one, ana the ex
plosion caused many times the damage
the robbers intended'it Bhould.
The janitor of tbe bank building,' E
dward lay. who was awakened from his
slmnbers by the explosion,- has tbe follow
ing to say concerning his experience: "I
Bleep on the fifth flooT of tbe building and
was awakened suddenly by . a loud report.
It seemed to me as loud as a rifle. I
thought that, it must have been a police
man firing his pistol at some one, and so I
went to a window on the Fourteenth-street
side of the building. â¢ â : . i
"Everything Beemed to be TÂ«ry quiet,
and after I : had been â  looking out of my
window about five minutes I saw a police
man walking slowly by. He went as far
as tb.e narrow-gauge depot and then carve
back on the other side of the street. From
the way that he acted I supposed that
everything was right, but before going
i back to bed I looked out on the Broadway
Bide of tho building ; and saw : nothing un
usual there. I then went back to bed, and
it was then 20 minutes to 4 by my clock. I
thought no more of the affair until I was
told that Girard's safe had been cracked."
Flagman J..W; Hill, who asserts that he
heard the explosion . at 6 o'clock, has the
following to say ; "I come on duty here at
Fourteenth and Broadway at 5:30 o'clock.
About -6 o'clock this morning the night
engineer of tbe eas works came along and
he stopped for a moment to talk with me.
While we were talking we heard a report
coming from the direction of : Girard's
store. I remarked, that someone had fired
a pistol over there, but no one went over
to the place. It â¢ was still quite dark at
this time." .\ ; .-*' : - '.'."X-^',.
From these facts it is certain , that there
were two distinct explosions, and that the
modus operaadiof ; the burglars was as'
previously mentioned. The .full force of
the I big explosion was evidently received
by a piano which stood at an angle to ; the
front of the oflice. Â«Half iof the ""outside
plate of tlje safe door struck this instru
ment with terrific force, completely shat
tering it. The heavy piece ;of : steel s then
rebounded against another piano, cutting
deep gash into tbe side of the instru
ment. Itthen fell to the floor. ,
The orher half of the outside plate of
the door was evidently sent flying through
tl >c air and alighted in the front portion of
tu e store, caroming on one of the pianos
as .'t "vent, A piece of the ? wooden parti
tion of the office was alyo sent v flying at
another angle and made an indention?in
â¢c plastering ten feet from the floor in
ciose proximity to picture. A ; third
piano â  h ad: a portion of the veneering
knocked off by a ving missile. : .v-::.> : , -K \ -
â frank Girard said to-day that he had t; a
premonition yesterday that ;he r would
safe r hÂ«. bea ' , and tne". money .{iuj: the
tÂ«it n belon Bed to his wife. "They have
Â«m "i eTe thll !Â«Â«" he said. "There was

LtnSc ! y i i faave a^ so missed some bank
ftÂ° enc n and ban books and notes. The

"Uj.wnen we unlocked the store and
found that the place had been robbed we
could net find a single officer to come
over here. There was not one at the City
Hal!. The Chief has not been here yet.
Only Detectives Shorey and Williams
have been here. They can't do any good
now. anyway. They can't get my money
and jeweiry back and they can't fix up my
pianos."
Chief Lloyd says he is satisfiedthat the
work was done after 5 o'clock. "The
officers all report off at 5 o'clock," said he,
"and from the reports received the safe
must have been blown open within a very
short time after that hour. It is possible
that part of the work was done shortly
after 3 o'clock and finding that a big noise
had been created they decamped. Later
they investigated and found their work
was undiscovered, and then they returned
to the attack and wero more successful.
That would explain why there is such a
difference of opinion as to the hour the
reports were heard. If this theory is cor
rect, then all of these people are correct as
to the time."
Since the 13th of January there have been
six safes cracked, thirty-two burglaries
committed and four hold-urs in Oakland,
Alameda and .Berkeley, and not a , single
man has been arrested. The record of the

GIRARD'S WILL LOST.
The Burglars Cause the Piano Man
to See Vlsons of Lit
igation.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 4.â Mr. Girard, I
whose store was wrecked, has a difficult j
matter to handle. It did not come to his
notice until the excitement caused by to
day's burglary at his store had subsided.
Then he remembered that among the pa
pers taken from his strong-box was Ins
last will and testament.
The loss of the will caused a host of un
pleasant possibilities to come to hi 9 mem
ory. He had made it carefully and
thoughtfully and had placed it away ready
to be found when he should have crossed
into the land where thieves do not loot
strong-boxes. He had intended that no
one should look at that final disposition of
his property for two reasons. He might
want to chance his mind, and hÂ« might
have ''left out" some names of people
who would like to be in it, and if they did
not know it till to late too make alterations
they could not annoy him while alive.
"Yes, it's gone sure enough," said Mr.
Girard, as he looked for the tenth time
among the rags of the piano covers that
the explosive had scattered all over the
oftice. "The thieves have taken

my will â my last will and testa
ment. Now I am in a fix. They
may try to negotiate it.. Suppose I cannot
recall just how it was worded and should
make another one and the two should
differ? When the first one comes to the
surface again, as it surely will, then there
will be a contest, and nobody will know
just what I did mean. If it should stay
lost, then somebody might forge another
one and declare it was the one the burglars
stole, and there would be endless trouble,
and I thought I had matters fixed up
beautifully.
"Then again, the robbers might become
acquainted with my business and social
affairs, and might sell that will to some
interested party. It is no joke to lose your
last will and testament. Suppose I should
die to-day, I should not have left a will,
and I am mad enough to die. There is
only one remedy for it; I shall have to
make another will. I hate to do it, as it's
a mean job to prepare for leaving a world
that's been a pretty decent one after all,
even it there are a few rogues in it. But
there's no hope for it."
RESULT OF POLITICS.
How Corruption Has Worked to the
Detriment of the Police
Force.
Oakland Office, San Fbancibco Call,)
' 908 Broadway, Feb. 4. j
When Sir. Girard looked over his
wrecked warehouse to-day and said "This
is politics," he told a naked truth. The
present era of crime in Oakland is the
direct result of ten years of corrupt politics.
It is clear apparent that not one half of the
police force is doing its duty. There is a
motive for this systematic neglect, and it
is to be found in the fact that the depart
ment is overwhelmingly in politics and
that s large proportion of the force is
anxious to heap ignominy on the present

Store.

j administration. Chief Lloyd, by . his
I numerous raids on gambling dens and
I illegal saloons, has created an army of
enemies who will stop af nothing to ac
complish his official rain. They realize
that their existence depends" on im
munity from justice and they are now
convinced that, such immunity cannot
be enjoyed under Chief Lloyd. Many
I officers could be named who openly ridt-
I cule their chief, and because of his known
i religious propensities, are continually as
serting "that Christian Endeavorers can
not catch rogues." Another remark often
I heard is that if Chief Lloyd is wanted "he
j is either leading the choir or conducting a
prayer-meeting." The spirit of indiffer
ence and disdain that prompts these re
! marks is significant of the feeling that
exists and helps to account for the fact
that although forty crimes have been com
j roitted in three weeks not a single arrest
j has been made excepting that of a Jad
! caught with burglars' tools in his posses
sion and sent to jail yesterday for five
months.
This state of affairs has undoubtedly
reached the ears of the crooks tbat usually
work in San Francisco, and they are now
in this city doing as they please and feel
ing safe from arrest. Unless some strong
moral support is accorded Chief Lloyd
and some radical changes are made in the
police force the prospect for the future is
no brighter than the present outlook.

the well-known Broadway merchant, keeps
a safe in his office in the rear of his store,
and he is very anxious that it shall not be
molested. He has adopted a novel method
of protecting it, and finds that it works
like a charm.
The stores all over town have been vis
ited, and now gas is burning all night long.
Mr. Moran keeps two jets of gas burning,
and last night he adopted the expedient
of havinsr one of bis clerks sleep in
side the store, ready to receive the
burglars, that might arrive. The plan
worked so well that the proprietor
intends to continue it. The clerk slept
souuuly all through the night and did not
even move. A burglar or any one else look
ing through the wire-screened window on
Eleventh street could plainly see the pro
tector of the store. Trousers were on one
chair, a hat on top of a bundle of clothes,
a pair of boots were against the counter
and the scene was one of an improvised
bedroom.
Policeman Carson was on that beat last
night and he was the first to detect the
anti-burglar device. The light fell strongly
on the features and people who took one.
look at the clerk will never forget
it. It was. a face that leaves what roman
cists call "an indelible impression on the
memory." It created just such an impres-
sion on one r>erson, and at noon to-day a
big discovery was made.
The clerk who had guarded the stove*
during the night was on duty during the
day supporting a suit of clothes on the in
ner ed^e of the sidewalk. Mr. Moran was
consulted and the secret leaked out. The
"clerk" was a store dummy, and the shoes,
hat and clothing were but adjuncts to the
great anti-burglar device.
"It protected my store," said Mr. Moran
to-day, "and that's more than half a
dozen officers did for Brother Girard."

Â . 908 Broadway, Feb. 4. j
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. There are
four men at work on Fred Saubech's place,
634 Valdez street, between Livingston and
Dennison, sinking a shaft. They are not
at all inclined to talk, but appear to know
their business and stick to it. They have
gonedown to a ; depth ;of twenty-five feet
and are now in a brown gravel, which con
tains an apparently unlimited supply of
water which somewhat interferes with the
work. â¢
â¢"â¢ Mr. Laubech is well advanced in years
and is well known in the vicinity where
he ; resides. When questioned ;â â¢â  regarding
the men's work, be said: -"N o, I have not
ordered a well due. All ' I know is that
these men ; came to me and r 6aid they
wanted to dig, and I told them they could
c"ig .if .:; they desired to do i so. I;do : not
know whether there is gold there or not.
If they -should : be so fortunate as to find
gold while "digging' there I guess they
would let me have a part of it at least." \
A full-grown son â of .Mr. Saubech re
marked: "I might as welt tell you the
truth ; regarding this : matter. My father
has nothing to do regarding this work.
These men came here and told him they
believed there was gold down in: this
gravel ami they wanted his permission to
uig for it. He told them to go ahead and
dig as long as they wanted." : .
" The quartet work very systematically.
Two of the treasure- seekers work a primi
tive windlass over the shaft, while one aiga
at the bottom and sends up great buckets
ftU of crayei,'. which the fourth and oldest
man dumps into a wheelbarrow and caTe
fuliy carts off to a safe part of the lot,
where it is deposited with as much care as
if every pebble was pure .gold.
Owing to the great flow of water the
work has been slow, but to-day they se
cured the old Felton engine, with Andy
Hutchison as engineer, and soon had the
shaft pumped out. After that the work
proceeded more rapidly. The shaft is en
cased with pine boards about, five feet
square. These are greatly decayed and
certainly could not have * been put :in by
the . present workers. ,It is believed that
this wooden casing has aroused the cupid
ity of the workmen, but how they learned
of the old well is a mystery. The work
men are the same as those who, some time
ago, sought for hidden treasure* on old
Garibaldi's place in West Oakland. â  -

': ! J UNIQUE I GAMBLING Vi-ATOUT
Captured During the Sunday Raid- in
, â ."/â - , Chinatowni s'-; â¢
i OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 4.â The first raid
on ; the Chinesoygamblers of this city in
over five years bas resulted; in securing a
very unique layout, which ' is now in the
police station property-room. The princi
pal implement used in T the tan game of the
Chinese is: a flat white button, or cor
rectly, a large number of } them. To play
the dealer takes { a handful of â¢ these and
covers them : ? up I with " 5 a>. braas receptacle.
The ; players : then Â» bet, after, which . the
dealer removes the cover and, with a thin
piece iof i bamboo, separates * the ? buttons
into 5 piles ?of j.-;f our j each. i%He 5 goes very
slowly, so as Ito I give v all the .players ? a
chance count } the buttons. According,
as there are one, two, three or four left in
the Jast pile the winnings are made. <
: Knowing their game to be i: unlawful the
wily Chinese have everything 5 prepared
for a raid of . the I police. They have a tin
scoop with a round hole in the handle,
and to this is attached a bag. In case of
.111 alarm the buttons are scooped? up and
the *; bag s thrown into some ; convenient
hiding - place. r-- In the â  recent - raid ; they
only bad time to throw it behind a box,
where it was soon found by the officar*, j
It is said that the dealer becomes such an i
expert that the entire lot can be swept up
at one stroke when the alarm is given by
the lookout. Besides the thin white^but
ton used by the dealer the other players
have different buttons to indicate the
amount of the.ir bet. All participants bet
asainst the dealer and at the end of the
game another Chinese pays the bets from
a small inclosure.
NONSUIT DENIED.
The Kallrojul Cannot Endanger I4veÂ« by
Ejecting Would-pe Passengers.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 4.â Judge Ogden
denied the motion for a nonsuit in the
case of Colonel Wettstein against, the
Southern Pacific for $20,000 damages for
injuries alleged to have been received by
plaintiff in bei'ig thrown down by a gate
man while attempting to board a Seventh
street local train at Broadway on March
15, 1895. In doing so the court held that
the rule had been laid down in the case of
Meuk vs. the- Southern Pacific Railroad
Company, in which it was held that even
in case of trespass the defendant had no
right to eject him under circumstances
that would endanger his personal safety.
The first witness for the defense was G.
H. Kellogg, ex-railroad detective. He ad
mitted to having tried to get on the plain
tiff's side of the case, and that he also
expected to get back into the employ of
the railroad company.
Judge Ogden this afternoon denied the
demand of the defendants to compel the
plaintiff to submit to a physical- examina
tion. A motion by the defense to strike
the cojtn plaint from the nles and dismiss
the suit was also denied.

OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 4.â The trustees
of the Alurich estate over which there is a

objections to a hearing of the annual
account of the trustees. The motion was
on the ground that the court was without
jurisdiction and that proper notice had
not been given contestant of the petition
for the distribution of the estate to the
trustees.
Judge Greene held that the Probate
Court had jurisdiction, while on the
second point said the decree of distribu*
tion was conclusive as to the question of
notice. . He deemed the right of a
collateral attack upon the notice. The
contestant waa given ten days to prepare
and file objections to the annual account.

POISON IN THEIR TEA
Mary Burnett of Alameda Tries
to Kill Her Grand-
Parents.
A DOSE OP BOUGH ON BATS.
Mr. and Mrs. Burnett Swallowed the
Poison â Saved by a
Physician.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 4.â Because her
grandparents had taken occasion to repri
mand her for some trivial offense, Mary
Agnes Burnett, a young girl 16 years of
age, who lives at Bay station, tried to
poison them by putting "rough on rats"
in their tea. The erandparents, Mr. and
Mrs. Evan Burnett, owe their existence to
the prompt work of Dr. Sander. When
summoned to tbe assistance of the aged
couple the poison had begun to operate,
and it was only after considerable effort
that the physician was able to save the
victims.
It was not known at first who had placed
the poison in the cups for Mr. and Mrs.
Burnett. Suspicion, however, pointed to
the granddaughter, because of her nervous
manner and peculiar actions. She denied
emphatically, upon being accused, that
she was guilty.
The girl's conscience must have smitten
her later, however, for she wrote a letter
to Dr. Sander confessing that she had tried
to poison her grandparents, and expressed
great sorrow and repentance for her acts.
She implored the doctor to shield her.
But the doctor did not do so,
and, instead, he gave the let*
ter to the grandparents. They
made all haste to &et the girl away from
this city and arranged to send her to other
relatives in Colusa, where she now is. The
girl has always received the best of treat
ment at the hands of Mr. and Mrs. Bur
nett, and they are unable to account for
her attempt at life-taking, unless it bo the
intense anger which became aroused on
account of some fancied great wrong.

corner of Minturn street. Some old clothes
in a closet adjoining the Kitchen were dis
covered to be blazing by Mrs. Davis, who
turned in the alarm. The fire was put out
without the assistance of the department,
damage amounting to about $25.
THE INQUEST RECORD.
Welsh Hanlou'g Death an Accident and
Thomas Arilhigtou'g Fate a
Suicide.
Among the four inquests held by Cor
oner Hawkins yesterday were those on
Welsh Hanlon, a victim of an explosion
at Perine's quarry in San Mateo County,
and Thomas L. Adlington, an old English
bartender, who, being out of work and
penniless, poisoned himself with mor
phine.
The jury found that in Hanlon's case
the death was accidental. Hanlon was an
old man and somewhat deaf. When or
dered by Foreman Drum to come down
from the top o-f the hill and "tamp" a
hole which had already been "sprung,"
he at first did not understand. Finally
he was made to hear, and owing to the
loss of time caused by his failure to hear
the order at first, he reached the hole fust
a little before the explosion. Drum was
badly injured also and" is now at the City
and County Hospital. Hanlon was em
ployed by Contractor Smith; it was said.
He died at the City and County Hospital
January 21.
In Arlington's case the verdict was sui
cide. He expected to obtain work at the
Cliff House, but was disappointed. He
took the morphine at 110 Ninth street and
died at the^ Receiving Hospital January
28. He waa 60 years old.

INSURANCE AND JUSTICE
Technicalities Insisted On in a
Case in the Federal
Courts.
Because Its Evidence Was Not Abso
lutely Explicit a Company Is
Made to Suffer.
A decision rendered by the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals in this City yes-'
terday presents a phase of the stern re
quirements of law which, while of inci
dental interest to insurance circles, will
not be forgotten for some time by attor
neys.
The appeal acted upon was that of the
Provident Savings Life Assurance Society
from the verdict of the jury in favor of
Cora i- 1 . Nixon, widow of Thomas L.
Nixon, a Tacom.i man, who had insured
his life for ?'JO,OOO, the policies of $5000 and
$15,000.
Apparently the company had the justice
of the case on its side, while the plaintiff
had all the technicalities of the legal pro
cedure in the trial of her case in her favor.
Evidence of the company had been ruled
out on technical grounds, and, in accord
ance with the action of the bench in the
lower court in ruline out this evidence and
instructing the jury as to the absolute
neÂ« ssity of the lesal technicalities being
complied with, the jury found for the
plaintiff.
The appeal was arpued before Circuit
Judges McKennaund Gilbert and District
Judge Hawley, and Judge McKenna wrote
the opinion. The decision sustains the
lower court anrt affirms its judgment.
The company may, under the circum
stances, demand a review by the United
States Supreme Court, for its local agent,
George C. Pratt, feels that while the de
cision may be strictly in accordance with
the rules of evidence, justice has fallen
short, and the company is made to suffer
because of the strict letter of the rules of
the court on Puget Sound.
According, to The decision Nixon failed
to pay certain premiums on both policies.
The New York statute requires notice of
delinquency to be given to the insured and
allows thirty days in which the unpaid
premiums are to be paid. If the delin
quent does not pay his premium witnin
this time limit his* policy becomes void
under this statute. The 'company being
coverned by the New York law, mailed
the necessary notes to Nixon, and its de
fense was that a-> he had not paid the pre
miums within the specified time his poli
cies were forfeited.
When the case came up for trial Secre
tary William E. Stevens and Clerks Harry
H. Meeder and E. Seward Prosser of the
general office in New York testitk d as to
the mailing of the required notices, but
Mr. Stevens' evidence was ruled out on
the ground that he was not a competent
person to testify, and that of the two
clerks was ruled" out on the ground that
their testimony did not show clearly that
the notices had been sent to the ""last
known postofhee address," or that the
"postage had been paid by the company,"
as the law explicitly requires.
Thus, although they could produce ex
hibits of the notices "sent to Nixon their
evidence did not avail in the lower court,
simply because it was net sufficiently ex
act as to these two details. Judge Mc-
Kei.na. in concluding his opinion, ob-
Berred :
"To allow the testimony to be proof of
the requirements of the statute would be
to relax it too much and afford opportun
ity for its evasion. 7 '
Nixon died April 18, 1891. His premium
on the |5000 policy which fell due on Sep
tember 12. 1890, was not paid, and that on
his $15,000 policy, which feJl due on Octo
ber 11, 1890, was not paid.
Agent Pratt explained yesterday that
his company has always been careful to
send the uoiicesrequired by the law and.
to be doubly sure, it takes particular care
also to send notices beforehand informing
its patrons when their premium's will be
come due.

THE FINANCES OF
TALBOT CLIFTON
Justice Kerrigan Will In
quire Into His
Standing.
THE GASFITTERS' BILL.
Even Telegrams Failed to Bring
Payment of an Indebt
edness.
HIS LORDSHIFS DELICATE TASTE
A Fender and Andirons That Were
Ordered Posthaste, but Not
Paid For.
Unless between now and next Friday
afternoon at '2 o'clock he produces $75 to
settle a gasfitter's bili, J. Talbot Clifton,
the young scion of the English nobility
â¢who has been cutting such a wide swath in
this City with his money, great coach and
horses, will be compelled to share with
Lord Sholto Douglas the dubious honor of
having appeajed before a Justice of the
Peace and pleaded guilty to poverty, or
told the eitentjof his negotiable property
and its location.
In spite of the fact that he is in receipt
of an allowance of $S<X)O per month from
his paternal relative in Merry England, J.
Talbot seems, at least in one instance, to
be undesirous of settling his just debts and
liabilities.
Bush & Mallet, the gasfitteTs. claim that
he owes them $75, and, becoming tired of
waitinc for their money and of being un
e ble to get even a premise to pay, have
de termined to bring him hefore the bar of
justice to explain why out of an in
come of $60,000 a year he cannot or will
not pay such a modest sxim as $75. In pur
suance of this object an order of examina
tion, returnable before Justice Kerrigan
on Friday afternoon, has been issued and
will be served on his lordship at the earli
. est opportunity.
J. Xalbot was raised amid surroundings
that gave him ail the comforts of home
and a delicate Â«ense of the fitness of har
mony in the shapes and hues of the arti
cles used in the routine of daily life. So,
when he Jeased a suite of luxurious apart
ments at the Maison Riche, his lirst object
was to see that nothing in the tittiugs of
the apartments wasallowed to remain that
should iffend nis esthetic taste or the
feelings of the choice spirits, who might
share the hospitality for which he is well
known. He soon discovered that the
fender and andirons were out of keeping
with trie decorations of tne mantel, and
pent his valet posthaste to the Bush &
Mallet establishment with the following
perfumed note: .
Gentlemen: Kindly send a fender and and
irons of your best design to my apartments at
the Maison Kiche. Please see that they har
monize \vLth the mantel and other flttines of
the room. J. Talbot Clifton.
The valet, who delivered the note, was
apparently bewildered at the array . of
Renders and other appliances shown him,
and finally in despair said :
"Better send half a dozen; he's horrible
particular."
So the firm loaded a wagon with reams
in brass and steel, wrought in chubby
cupids and alluring maidens, such as a
bachelor in his lone apartments might de
light to gaze upon. Their trusted em
ploye went, with the load to see that the
job was executed according to his lord
ship's order?, and a most bewitching
fender soon occupied the fireplace with a
pair of sturdy andirons that might have
reminded J. Taibot of his ancestral home.
Clifton had no trouble in getting his
fireplace fitted, but me rirm had -great
difficulty in getting the equivalent there
forâin fact, found it impossible.
Collectors who called with the bill were
met with the reply from thÂ« valet that his
lordship was not in, or was out of town.
Weeks grew into months and still the bill
was unpaid. Finally the firm received
word that J. Taibot was at Burlingame
enjovine the salubrious air of that resort.
A telegram was sent him asking for pay
ment of the bill, but never a word ah
ewered Clifton.
Then the gasfitters grew angry and
placed the matter in the hands of a col
lector of debfs. He was no more suc
cessful than the firm's collectors in getting
the money, but when suit was brought a
persistent Deputy Sheriff succeeded in
serving his lordahip with the papers even
as he awoke in bed from a refreshing
night's slumber.
J. Talbot did not defend the suit, and
Justice Kerrigan gave the collector judg
ment by default. As his lordship's assets
are not largely in evidence, he having
recently sold his racing stable and turned
the stream of his income into other chan
nels, the collector's only recourse was to
get out an order of examination and let
his lordship tell on oath where his prop
erty, if he has any, is concealed and of
what it consists.
A member of the firm of Bush & Mallet
said yesterday that they had treated Clif
ton just as they would treat any other de
linquent creditorâ perhaps a little more so.
"Had this limb of the aristocracy shown
any inclination to pay or given us some
thing to understand whether or not he in
tended to pay, we might have been satis
fied," he said, "but the exasperating part
of the whole business was that he gave not
the slightest attention to the repeated calls
of our collector or to telegrams sent him
regarding the bill. His valet told our col
lector that he had a stack of letters a foot
high in his room that had never been
opened and that it was useless to try to see
him if be did not want to be seen. We
told the man to whom we gave the claim
for collection to get the money at any cost
and to take any proceedings he might
deem proper.
"Lord Clifton may plead the possession
of a single cent, as Lord Sholto Douglas
did, .when brought up on an order of exam
ination and thus evade payment, but we
will at least have the satisfaction of know
ing that he has nothing to pay with, poor
fellow. r
'â¢It may be, perhaps, that be was not
satisfied with the fender ana andirons but
he seemed pleased with them at the time
and should have notified us tbat they did
not suit him. We would not take them
back now and he must either pay or plead
poverty.

failed to register. Those who are not registered
may be deported. Inspector O. P. Stideer
found one who was unregistered, on Pacific
street, between Pupont and Stockton streets,
yesterday morning. He was promptly ar
rested arid deportntion proceedings followed.
The explanation of the prisoner is that he was
too sick to register at the proper time.
PUBLIC POKER PLAYING.
The Police Are Instructed to Knforce
the New Ordinance.
A certified copy of the ordinance prohib
iting the playing of poker in barrooms or
public places was received by Chief Crow
ley on Monday evening and he immedi
ately gave orders for it to be printed in the
form of a circular.
Yesterday morning Captains Wittman,
Spillane, Dunlevy and GiUin had a con
sultation with the Chief, and they were
instructed to see that a copy of the cir
cular was delivered to every saloon-keeper
and owner of a poker resort in their re-'
spective districts, and after a reasonable
time, if the provisions of the ordinance
were violated, to get warrants for the arrest
of the offenders.
"I will see that the law is enforced,"
?aid the Chief, "but it is only right that
people should first know what the law is.
Poker-playing has been going on for years
in some barrooms and it would not be fair
to make any arrests until tlie provisions of
the ordinance get publicity, and the proper
way is to send a copy to every one con
cerned. Then there can be no excuse that
they did not know they were violating the
law."
The erdinance reads as follows:
It shall be unlawful for any person to play
the game of poker many barroom or public
place; or for any pcrsou having possession of
or being in charge of any barroom or public
place to permit the game of poker to be played
therein; or for any person to play with or per
mit any minor to play the game of poker in
any room or place adjacent to or connected
â with any barroom or public place, or # else
where; and upon conviction thereof, sucn ptr-

son shall be punished by a fine not exceeding
$1000, or by imprisonment in the County Jail
not exceeding six months, or by both such tine
and imprisonment.
The men who are conducting poker
rooms have decided to subrartt to an arrest
in order to bring about a test case to ascer
tain the effectiveness or rather the valid
ity of the new ordinance.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1896.
ARMER`S DESIGN
WAS STOLEN
The Designer of the Mardi
Gras Invitation Con
fesses It.
FILCHED FROM CUCUEL.
A Short Interview That Caused
Director Bosqui Great Mental
Pain.
AN ARTISTIC STORM BREWING
Nearly the Entire Picture Was Taken
From a Work Produced in the
Year 1894.
India had its Nana Sahib, South Africa
its Cecil Rhodes and the Art Association
has its Sidney Arrner.
The two former started wars, and the
latter is coming in a close second in the
same occupation. The trouble arising at
the present time resembles a Keith cyclone
coming up from the low hills back of
Berkeley, and threatens to take in the en
tire bay.
At first it looked like a small shower of
discomfort arising from a little bad
weather at the association, but it was
backed up by a most capable breeze that
seems to have been scurrying around out
side the heads ever since Sidney Armer
carried off the prize for his design of a
Mardi Gras invitation.
Yesterday afternoon the tempest broke
with relentless fury when it was discov
ered that Mr. Armer's design had been
filched from the work of Edward Oucuel, a
San Francisco boy who is at present study
ing at the art schools of Pans.
Mr. Cucuel's father was the first to make
the discovery that Armer had taken the
figures from his son's picture of "An Art
Students' Bal Masque in Paris," and being
a proud father and a devotee of liis son's
work, he immediately rose up in justifies
paternal wrath and clamored for some
comparisons in the sight of witnesses.
"Here," said Mr. Cucuel to some mem
bers of the Art Association/ "this Armer
business doesn't go. Armer swiped those
figures, at least three of them, from pic
tures made by my boy in Paris in 1894.
If you don't believe it come with me and
see for yourself," whereupon he dragged
his auditors up to the offite of the Over
land Monthly, where the Parisian picture
had been deposited, and placed the latest
Mardi Graa invitation beside it for com
parison.
"How does that strike you?" he said
with a wave of his arm and a satisfied
wink at all hands. "I want you to look
at it and see the remarkable resemblance.
1 his figure, and this figure, and this fig
ure, ' indicating them as he talked, "those
are the most important ones, to say noth
ing of the general composition. It's there,
isn't it? Well. Cold-blooded steal. That's
all I have to say. Do you see it?"
"I guess you're right, Cucuel," replied
one of the Art Association, looking thought
fully at the two productions. "Your son
ought to have that $20, as in reality the
committee accepted his design, which
seems to have been submitted through the
courtesy of Armer. If I were you I would
demand the cash."
"That's what I propose to do," an
swered Cucuel with considerable vehe
mence, as though a new idea Had struck
him. "I should jay I would demand it,
and right away, too. The boy ought to
have it, and by the Lord Harry he shall
have it." With this latter exclamation
Cucuel started for the elevator, prepara
tory to getting back to earth and heading
for the Art Association. Nothing more
was seen of him during the day. but it is
pretty well understood that ne is prepar
ing to swoop aown upon the committee
and demand the rights of his son in the
nnme of art and justice.
Mr. Bosqui, one of the directors of the
Art Association and also the lithographer
for whom Armer works occasionally, was
next visited. He said:
"I was aware that Armer copied some of
the figures from Cucuel's picture, as we
had it here in ray office. I do not think,
however, that Mr. Arnier claims it was his
own design He did not get the $20 prize
for it, anyhow. Perhaps it would be well
for us to go and see him about it and settle
the whole matter that way. Come with
me and we will go up to the institute."
Mr. Bosqui got up from his.de.sk, and the
reporter and the director went to the ba'ih
wick of Mr. Armer, wnere he was found
drawing away- industriously at what ap
"pa'-ed to be a title page for some new
book.
'â¢Mr. Armer, are you the gentleman who
received the prize for the best design for
an invitation to the Mardi Gras ball," was
asked of him.
'â Yes, sir." responded the young man
with a deep blush.
"And dfd you receive j r our $20 cash
prize?"
"Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I got the $20."
"Was the design absolutely original?"
"Certainly. Every bit of it was mv own
designing. Yes. I wasthedesigner.' r Mr.
Arraer was now able to control his blushes
and began to feel more at home.
"Is it true, Mr. Armer, that you copied
three of the figures from a work by Ed
ward Cucuel?"
"What? No, sir. Or, yes Iâ Iâ Iâ"
"For instance the main figure standing
near the central foreground, with a raised
arm and distended fingers?"
."Well, yes, I did take that."
"And the ncure of the clown on the
right?" '.;â¢â¢â 
"Oh, yes. You mean that queer figure
with one foot raised like this:" Mr. Aimer
then struck an attitude. "Yes, I took that
also from Cucuel's picture."
"And also the man with the knife in his
hand?"
"Well, yes, I got that one, too,"
As well as the moon effect in the back
ground?"
o "U m phâ umph," he replied reluctantly.
Suddenly he looked up and caught Mr.
.Bosqui looking at him in astonishment,
whereupon he admitted that Cucuel's pic
ture was Riven him by Mr. Shehan, Bos
qui s foreman, who instructed him to
make a design on that basis. In a few
moments he was. again in the realm of
blushes and, covered with confusion, he
further acknowledged that he did not get
the $20 and that he personally thought the
design was not entitled to even the ap
proval of the committee, which apparently
seems to be about all it got.
Mr. Bosqui got outside the building
shortly after that, and was completely
overcome at the result of the interview
with Armer. His face indicated that he
had about located the spot where the man
tle of Ananias fell when that able gentle
man departed thi3 life. He simply stood
spellbound with astonishment at the story
of Armer's originality, and the wonderful
serenity displayed by the younp man. He
was careful, however, to keep his thoughts
to himself, and with the exception of. an
occasional reference to Armer s imperti
nence, said but little.
The news of Armer's confession spread
all over the Bohemian quarter in a short
time, and those of the artists who had a
French dinner last night attended to it
that the wine was of the best quality, and
that the label had not been stolen from the
design of an art student in Paris.
Considerable trouble is likely to occur
over the developments, owing to the fact
that a "steal" should have won the prize
or the approval of the committee over the
original drawings and designs offered by
artists of the association.
CHARGED WITH MURDER
"Dr." Bertha Dale Blamed for the
Death of Mrs. Katie
Gauch.
AERESTED AT THE INQUEST.
t>eath Due to Mrs. Dale's Malpractice
Was the Verdict of the Coro
ner's Jury.
A charge of criminal practiceâ fatal
criminal practiceâ against Mr 3. Bertha
Dale, "midwife," of 1328 Grove street, was
embraced in the terse verdict returned by
the Coroner's jury yesterday as the result
of the inquest held to ascertain the cause
of Mrs. Katie Gauch's death.
Mrs. Gauch died January 28 at the home
of her husband, Adam Gauch, a baker, at
913 Buchanan street. She was a compara
tively young woman, being 31 years of
age. From the evidence the jury learned
that Mrs. Dale had been a frequent visitor
there during the previous month. As she
was a customer of the bakery no suspicion
attached to. her visits until Mrs. Gauch,
soon after becoming sick, confessed to her
husband that she had undergone an oper
ation on January 3.
The husband was one of the principal
witnesses at the inquest. Mrs. Dale was
on hand also. He told the substance of his
wile's confession. Mrs. Pale said she had
not done other than to prescribe certain
mild remedies and treatments for what
she supposed was an ordinary derange
ment. She stated that slie did not really
.know what the sick woman's actual condi
tion was, because the woman had misin
formed her. The man who is now a
widower, was asked why he did not ac
quaint the Coroner before of the facts of
his wife's illness and death, and his ex
planation was that he was anxious to keep
the matter quiet.
From the husband's statement it was
learned that after he knew of Mrs. Dale's
act he acted as a messeneer to Lainer's
drugstore, on McAllister street, for the
medicines Mrs. Dale prescribed.
Dr. Frederick J. Hunt, who had been
called to attend the woman shortly before
her c^eath, noticed peculiar symptoms, and
eventually the husband told'him what his
wife's condition was and the cause. Mrs.
Gauch, herself, did not tell him though,
until he questioned her. Her excuse was
that she was afraid she/would be scolded.
Dr. Hunt found strong evidence of general
peritonitis. The doctor's testimony was
that the woman's death was due to blood
poijonins; caused by malpractice. The
mother of the woman, Mrs. Hauser of
South San Francisco, was also a witness,
but did not have any p%rsonal knowledge
of the facts.
The verdict of the jury was that Mrs.
Gauch's death was caused* by a criminal
operation performed by Mrs. Dale.
Mrs. Dale was at once arrested, Detective
Byram and Policeman Colem taking her
in charge. She was taken to. the City
Prison and a charge of murder was booked
against her. She was once before arrested
for illegal practice, but was not convicted.
In her statement to the Coroner's jury she
admitted this. She gave the information
also that she had not treated Mrs, Gauch
for any specific consideration. She re
iterated that she did not know while she
was treating her that the woman was in a
delicate condition.
A FATHER'S UNUSUAL SUIT
He Wishes His Wife Compelled
to Support Their Little
Child.
Charles R. Detrick, the Attorney, Re
verses the Customary Order
of Things.
Charles R. Detrick has instituted a pe
culiar suit against his wife, Helen Jessie
Bowie Detrick. He wishes her to assist in
the support of their child, while at the
same time he wishes to secure the custody
of the little one himself.
Detrick alleges in his complaint that he
and his wife were married on December
2, 1893. The child in question was born
on August 30, 1894. On February 4, 1895,
Mrs. Detrick willfully ana without cause,
the complaint states, left her home and
her husband, and has since lived apart
from him.
When she left she took the child With
her. The husband was allowed to see the
child, however, up to about a week ago,
but she suddenly put a stop to his visits,
and now the child is kept concealed.
In his complaint Detrick says that his
wife is not a tit and proper person to have
charge of the boy, for, he says, she has a
violent and an uncontrollabfe temper. In
bis own behalf he says he thinks he iÂ» a
fit and proper person to have control of
the child, and tha}, he has a good home for
the boy. But his means are not very ex
tensive, in which particular, he says, they
differ materially from those of his wife,
and he thinks she should contribute a
good part of tae money needed to properly
care for the boy. She has an income of
$165 from her separate property, while he
has but a fitful income from his law prac
tice, and he considers it only proper that
the mother should contribute to the sup
port of the child.
This is a reversal of the points of the
cases usually filed upon such a point.
