to he used next Sunday in blowing up the
walls.
In the excitement they hoped to make
their escape. Tiieir plot was foiled by the

ARMENIANS ARE
YET IN TERROR.
Suffering of a Persecuted
People Increased by the
Turks.
DEATHS FROM EXPOSURE
Other Unfortunates Killed for Not
Surrendering Their Faith to
Moslems.
PROGRESS OF RELIEF WORK
Now the Porte Gives Assurances That
Missionaries Will Not Be
Molested.
BOSTON, Mass., April 9.â Letters re
ceived in Boston state that there is much
suffering in all the regions about as well as
in Bitlis, Eastern Turkey, some having
died from hunger and exposure in the
provinces, while others have been killed if
they did not surrender their faith. Fifteen
hundred dollars has been sent on from
England, but it is nearly all expended and
more relief funds are needed.
The relief work in Erzeroum, Eastern
Turkey, grows. Assistance is given to be
tween 20,000 and 25,000 people. More than
half of the Armenian population of this
province is in extreme destitution. There
must be at least 70,000 people in the
province in distress. The emigration to
Russia continues.
The need will not pass for a long time.
This relief must be kept up for a month at
least. The outlook is still very cloudy.
The attitude of the Turks ke^ps the Ar
rrenianÃ in terror, and everybody is wait
ing for spring in the deepest anxiety.
In Harpoot, Eastern Turkey, relief work
has reached 60,000 people. New villages
crop up almost every day âvillages never
heard of before. Great caution is used to
keep people off the list who can possibly
get other means to lire.
The past ten daysâ the letter is dated
March 7 â has witnessed quite an increase
in the fear and anxiety of the people. The
Armenians, of course, are extremely timid,
and the attitude of the Turks has been
such as to increase their alarm.
Notwithstanding rumors to the con
trary, Clara Barton cables the New Eng
land Armeniun Relief Committee of
Boston of her successful work aB follows:
"News from expeditions jvist received
Â«hows our relief work firmly established.
In no manner do authorities endeavor to
control our actions. The latest reports re
ceived by the committee state that the
suffering is intense and that many in their
despondency are diiven to suicide."
ASSURANCES OJT THE PORTE.
Missionaries Will JS'ot Be Jurthr r
Molested.
CONSTANTINOPLE. Turkey, April 9.â
The Porte, in reply to the representa
tions made to it by John W. Riddle,
American Charge d' Affaires, and Sir
Philip Currie, the British Embassador, has
given positive assurances to them that the
missionaries will in no wise be molested
while they conform to the laws of the
country.
The high-handed action of the authori
ties at Bitlis in expelling the American
missionary, Rev. Mr. Knapp, is regarded
here as a serious menace to all charitable
work in Anatolia. The action of the Gov
ernment was probably taken in obedience
to orders from the palace â not from the
Porte. Dispatches from Diarbekir state
that Knapp is the guest of the Vali of that
place, being treated with every possible
consideration.

enberg. The Prince of Wales and the
Grand Duchess of -Mecklenburg-Schwerin
were the sponsors for the infant. The
child is the fruit of a morganatic marriage
which took place at San Remo in 1891 and
resulted in putting the Grand Duke in
disfavor at the St. Petersburg court.
Czar Alexander 111 dismissed him from
the army, in which he was reinstated by
the present Emperor, who restored him to

BILL RAIDLER IS GUILTY.
Conviction of the Notorious
Outlaw for Attempted
Mail Robbery.
Murder Among the Crimes Committed
by the Desperado and
His Associates.
WICHITA, Kans., April 9.â 8i1l Raidler,
the notorious outlaw whose trial on the
charge of attempted mail robbery at
Dover, 0. T., on the night of April 3, 1895,
has been in progress in the United States
District Court, at Kingfisher, since the Ist
inst., was found guilty to-day. The pen
alty has not yet been lixed. There was no
evidence is defense, Raidler's attorneys
making their fight on the fact that the
desperadoes did not enter the mailcar
and that the mails were not touched. The
defense practically admitted that Raidler
participated in the train robbery. Notice
of an appeal to the Supreme Court was
given. At the Dover robbery the robbers
made only a small haul, and to add to
their ill luck was the fact thai United
States Marshals were near by, and the
Rock Island Railway on which the robbery
occurred furnished the oilicers almost im
mediate transportation to a point near
which it was supposed that the outlaws
would ride after leaving the train.
Concerned in the perpetration of this
robbery was BUI Raidler, Tulsa Jack,
Bitter Creek, Charles Pearce and Red
Buck. Others may have engaged in it, but
their names are not known. Almost im
mediately after the robbery the Rock
Island Railway furnished transportation
to deputies in special cars together with
their horses, from El Reno, where they
were stationed, to a point near Dover. At
Dover the deputies took up the chase on
horse back and trailed the outlaws to a
point about forty miles west of Dover.
There they surprised the robbers and in
the light that ensued Tulsa Jack was killed
and Pearce was badly wounded. The
other outlaws escaped and Hed toward
Payne County. On their way one of them,
supposed to be Raidler, shot and killed an
aged preacher without any provocation
whatever.
The following August Raidler was lo
cated in the Cherokee Nation and shot by
Marshals, but not fatally. In September,
18O.">. Deputy United Stat s Mars.iaL Bill
Tilghman, who afterward captured Biil
Doolin, shot Raidler in the head and arm
and captured him. Among the robberies
which Doolin and Raidler are charged
with is a $10,C00 bank robbery at Long
view, Tex. ; the Santa Fe train robbery at
i'ryor Creek in Indian Territory ; the
bank robbery at Mound Valley, Kans. ;
the Dover and Cimarron train robberies;
the Caneyville (Kans.) robbery, and num
erous others. Besides these Raidler and
Bitter Creek are charged with a f 10,000
robbery at Woodward, O. T., the money
being intercepted on its way from the
United States paymaster to Government
troops.

VALLEJO, Cai... April 9.â Mare Island's
rose carnival will long be remembered as
one of the bright epochs in the history of
tne naval station. Most beautiful were
the displays in the procession.

have been made under the direction of
Mrs. Captain H. L. Howison and Mrs. Pay
master H. T. Bkelding and Otbei ladies at
the station to have at the close of the
Lenten season a rose carnival. The one
to-day was the final culmination of much,
labor and many day dreams. All day long
the sky was threatening and interspersed
with heavy showers of rain, but nothing
stands in the way of those inured to mili
tary or naval life, and an order once pro
mulgated is seldom countermanded.
Promptly at 2 o'clock the line of march
\va3 taken up from the commandant's
quarters, and proceeded on out toward
the Naval Hospital. The Independence
band led the march, followed by a platoon
of marines clad as the first Roman soldiers,
their costume being green waistcoats,
scarlet breech and white leggings reach
ing from the hips down. Each gladiator
bore a myrtle-trimmed, round shield in
one hand, and a long spear in the other.
Their heads were bound in wreaths of
myrtle; two little tots acted as standard
bearers. The leader rode a black charger.
Following came a platoon of Roman
guards, clad in blue with scarlet shoulder
scarfs. They hauled a Gatling gun
trimmed in flowers of various hues. The
American flag in each of the platoons
formed a conspicuous part in the display,
as it did in the various squads of footmen.
The gunboat Uennington sent a detach
ment of bluejackets, dragging a large
float, representing a gig, trimmed in white
md green. They made a creditable ap
pearance in the line of march.
The monitor Monadnock, just from the
lower coast, arrived in ample time to tit
up a float, representing the monitor, with
her long guns pointing fore and aft. The
representation was a good one, even to the
arrangement of heavy smoke issuing
from the stack. This float was drawn by
fifty stalwart bluejackets. â¢â 
The receiving ship Independence sent
three detachments, each one dragging
howitzers appropriately decorated with,
flowers. The lirst detachment was manned
by marines clad in red, the trimmings of
the gun carriage being composed of rich,
red roses. The next division was comp
osed of sailors in white uniforms, the
trimmings of the guns being of white
roses. The third division was clothed in
blue, with trimmings of the carriages and
guns in violets.
Following the footmen and led by Pay
master Stanton as field marshal astride of
a coal-black charger with a wreath of red
roses about the horse's neck tne carriages
came. The commandant's barouche was
completely enveloped in myriads of snow
balls. The white harness and the black
horses were in marked contrast. The oc
cupants of this carriage, clothed in white,
were: Mrs. Captain Howison, Mis*
Genevieve English, Miss Hostwick, Mi^9
Sewell and Miss Carmen. Each lady car
ried a white parasol enveloped in snow
balls. Baskets of flowers were carried,
from which they were freely scattered to
the host of admirers. Mr^. Lieutenant
Perkins followe.l, her horse ar.d cart being
beautifully trimmed with roses and yel
low flowers and ribbons. The fair occu
pant was accompanied by an orderly. A
canopj- of the flowers added to the beauty
of the exhibit. Mrs. Perkins wore a wrap
of yellow silk.
Paymaster Rkelciing's carriage was
trimmed in calla lilies and received un
bounded praise for its beauty, and was oc
cupied by Miss Skelding and Miss La
Count, dressed in white, which added
much beauty to the floral display.
The surry occupied by Chaplain and
Mrs. McAlister and the Misses McCalla
was trimmed in white and trreen ami
looked rich in its decorations.
Mrs. Major Pope and Miss iicCalla oc<
rupied seats in the cart of the former,
elaborately trimmed with white roses.
Mrs. Lieutenant-Commander Symonda
and Miss Barker rode in a carriage beauti
fully trimmed in appropriate colors.
The phaeton occupied by Miss Maud
Burnap and Miss Isabell Pignian was
driven by a. tandem team, the cart being
trimmed in pink, with a canopy of the
same live.
Miss Paity Palmer, Miss Macrae and
Miss Decker rode in a prettily decorated
carriage, the colors vicing with each otner
in their floral embclishnients.
Miss Cassie Clark and Miss McDougal
were greatly admired along tha route for
the tasteful display of flowers in the deco
rations on the horse and cart.
Mrs. S. S. Robinson drove a tandem of
three cream-colored horses led by two
bluejacsets. The lady is an expert horse
woman and the horses were appropriately
festooned with yellow flowers.
The carriage of Medical Inspector Woods
was lavishly decorated and occupied by
Miss Woods and Miss Ashbury.
Mrs. Chief Engineer Kutz and daughter
drove in a phaeton trinied in green and
white-
Lieutenant and Mrs. Lefavor had their
carriage completely enveloped in flowera
and green trimings.
The white horse and white harness at2
tached to the cart containing Mrs. Under
â wood, daughter of Paymaster Woodhs ; 'i
and her child, attracted favorable ce

Criminal Career of the Rascal Turk,

NEW YORK. N. V., April 9.â Ben
Ouni, a Turk, who is a miser as well as a
thief and habitual criminal, was before
Judge Hurd in the Court of Sessions in
r.-\M klyn yesterday, charged with grand
larceny in the second degree. He stole
three diamond rings from a tray in a
Fulton-street jewelry-store about a month
and was captured as he ran off.
i^ a bad record. He was driven
out oi London because of his thefts ana
came : this city, where begot into trouble
with the authorities and was sent to
Wa la Island as an insane criminal.
When released he rled to Paris, robbed a
j. ler'a store and returned to this
country. He next appeared in Texas and
Mtd from there because he shot a man.
'liit n he wan caught stealing in Illinois
and spent some time in Joliet. Previous
to his arrest in Brooklyn he served a
sentence in New Jersey for a criminal
assault
He has a passion for diamonds. As ho
stood in court he had about $1500 worth of
diamonds sewed up in his clothing and a
wad of Diils amounting to $1000 in his
pockets. No one knew while he was
locked up in Raymond-street jail that he
was so wealth)' until a fellow-prisoner saw
him stealthily looking over his hoard. A
turnkey, to test the truth of the report
made by the prisoner, asked Ben Ooni to
change a $10 bill for him. Ben took it,
put it in his pocket and swore that it was
counterfeit, and that he would send it to
the Government. It was only when threat
ened witn a flogging that he returned the
money to the turnkey.
He was advised to engage a lawyer, but
said: "I haven't money to waste on law
yers. When I get oat I'll need all my
money. I have some more perns and casu
in a safe deposit vault, but I'll need all I
have." He saved the county the expense
of a trial by pleading guilty, and Judge
Hard remanded him until Monday next
for sentence.

DISTRESS AMONG
SERICULTURISTS
Thirty Thousand Bales of
Unsold Silk Held at
Yokohama.
DEALERS ARE BANKRUPT
Japan Not Successful in Collect
ing the Third War Loan
Installment.
DEMONSTRATIONS IN KOREA.
Massacres Committed in the Attempt
to Avenge the Death of the
Queen.
TOKIO, Jafak, March 24.â Great distress
exists among Japanese sericulturists and
silk-broker*. Silk that coula be sold easily
last year at $900 per bale rinds no pur
chasers now even at $650. Thirty thou-
sand bales are lying in Ypkohama awaiting
a market. ;ind that large stock will now
be increased by several thousand piculs of
spring reelings. No signs of a good demand
from either An-.erica or Europe are appa
rent. The wholesale silk merchants of Yoko
hama have petitioned the Government and
the two principal banks for aid, but with
out any favorable result. It is calculated
t hat the minimum loss to Japanese pro
ducers and middlemen will be $100 per
bale on the stocks already accumulated,
which means a total loss of over $3,000,000.
Among the thirty principal dealers in Yo
kohama about a dozen are reduced to the
verge of bankruptcy, and some twenty per
cent of the sericulturists in the provinces
â are ruined.
An acute conflict between the central
authorities and the Municipal Assembly of
Tokio has just ended in favor of the latter.
There exists in Tokio, Osaka and Kyoto,
the three chief cities in the empire, a
special municipal system, one feature of
which is that the Governor of the city, an
official nominee, is mayor ex officio,
whereas the office of mayor is elsewhere
elective. The system is distinctly un
popular, and has the effect of greatly
accentuating any friction between the
Governor, in his capacity of mayor, and
the municipality.
Last autumn it was discovered that a
Japanese company, under contract to
supply iron pipes for the Tokio Water
Works, had for sometime been carrying on
extensive frauds by substituting faulty
pipes for those that had passed the neces
sary tests, the result being a loss of over
1,01X1,000 yen to the city.
In discovering and exposing this fraud
the Governor played a use:ulpart, but the
Municipal Assembly saw an opportunity
of attacking him. Three times the As
sembly passed a vote of want of confidence
in him and three times it was dissolved by
order of the Minister of Home Affairs, not
merely for declaring itself dissatisfied with
the Governor, but because its action in
volved a legislative deadlock. Finally the
Government yielded and removed the
Governor to a sinecure â the post of Court
Councilor. Tne event caused much excite
ment in the city and was loudly claimed
by the opposition as a signal victory.
The attempt to raise a third installment
of the war loan in Japan has been uniquely
unsuccessful. The total amount of the
loan was 35,000,000 yen. but of that sum
bands representing 25,000,000 were given
to the Bank of Japan in payment of debts
contracted by the treasury during the war.
Thus the public were asked to subscribe
10,000,000 only. Bat there is a marked
tightness in the Japanese money market
at present. All available capital is needed
for >tarting new enterprises, so that Gov
ernment securities sell barely at their face
value. Under these circumstances the
subscriptions to the war loan aggregated
only $4,000,000, and it appears probable
that the Bank: of Japan will be obliged to
take the remaining six.
Anti-Japanese demonstrations continue
in Korea. The rebels now declare that
their main object is to avenge the death of
the Queen by driving out the Japanese.
The most serious outrage yet committed
has been the murder of fifteen Japanese
fishermen at Phyong-hai, some fifty miles
from Gensan. A party of twenty-four
fishermen, having landed to make some
arrangements for pursuing their occupa
'tion, were suddenly attacked by an over
whelming force of the rebels. Unarmed
and unprepared, fifteen of the Japanese
were killed on the spot. The remaining
nine, eight of them badly wounded, bare
ly escaped by swimming off to their junk.
Other assassination? of Japanese have
taken place here and there throughout the
provinces, and the Japanese residents of
Phyong-yang have appealed for aid. But
Phyong-yang is not yet accessible by wa
ter, and fears are entertained that the
little force of nine policemen stationed
there may be unable to repel an attack.
Meanwhile the women and children have
been sent away. Against the Japanese
settlement of Gensan still more formidable
demonstrations are made, but a Japanese
man-of-war having reached that place, no
serious danger is apprehended. It is
plain, however, that the Japanese nation
will not lone continue to endure all these
outrages tamely. The Korean problem is
again beginning to cause much anxiety.
Scarcely credible rumors are circulated to
the effect that small parties of Kus3ian3
are traveling through the peninsula fan
ning the anti-Japanese feeling.
The Japanerse Government contemplates
the organization of a new Department of
State, the Colonial Office, which will be
entrusted with the management of affairs
relating to Formosa and Hokkaido. The
programme is denounced by the opposi
tion politicians, wno profess to see in it
nothing more than a device to preserve
the balance of power between the Choslnu
and Satsuma statesmen. At present the
Choshiu statesmen are predominant, but
if a Satsuman man were appointed to the
new office equilibrium would be restored.
On the other hand, the source of this op
position is evidently an apprehension lest
one of the distinguished statesman now
out of office should be diverted from join
ing the opposition by receiving the new
portfolio.
The British schooner Esmer alda reached
Hongkong on March 9, after a most sensa

even when jury masts were rigged it con

on account of baffling winds. Provisions
being exhausted, the crew, eleven in num

smelling and rotten copra. Not till Feb

Hongkong, which place they reached after
sixty-two days of the greatest suffering.
The Formosan Budget for- 1896-97 has
been submitted to the Diet by the Japanese
Government. The revenue is six and a
half million yen, approximately; the ex
penditure, ordinary and extraordinary,
aggregates ten and three-quarter millions,
of which four and a half millions are for
works of improvement. Some time must
elapse before Formosa ceases to be a source
of expense to Japan.
The scheme of military reorganization
in Japan is now published. The army is
to be virtually doubled, the number of
divisions being raised from six to twelve,
exclusive of the Imperial Guards.
The Peking Gazette of December 19 con
tains an imperial decree embodying a re
port furnished by Tung Fu-hsiang, com
mander-in-chief of the forces employed
against the Mohammedan rebels in Kansu.
It is not always safe to place implicit
reliance in reports of their own doings
compiled by Chinese generals, but at pres
ent we have no means of verifying or con
tradicting Tung's story. Its gist is that
in a campaign lasting twenty days, Tung's
army fought six sanguinary battles and
executed a series of brilliant maneuvers,
ending in the relief of the provincial cap
ital and the complete route of the in
surgents beleaguering it. One feature of
the operation -was the capture of the rebel
chief Ma ShiL-jun and his decapitation
before the walls of a stronghold from
which he had saliied to repulse the im
perial troops.
To General Tung belongs the credit of a
device for keeping his men quiet during a
night march planned to surprise the
enemy. He made every soldier hold a
pebble in his mouth throughout the move
ment. How the thing was managed there
are unfortunately no details, but presuma
bly the braves' consciences revolted against
the mechanical crime of spitting out the
pebble. The desperate fights, the valor
ous storming of fortresses, the rapid
tactics, the masterly strategy of this
twenty days' campaign constitute a curi
ous marginal commentary to the war with
Japan.
Anti-foreign feeling is beginning to show
itself again in Cheng-tu. Violently word
ed placards are posted on the walls of the
city, and petty acts of hostility aeainst
the Canadian mission are once more re
corded.
NAVAL APPROPRIATIONS.
Amendments Made to the Bill
by the Senate Com
mittee.
Not More Than Two Battle-Ships or
Three Torpedo-Beats to Be Built
at One Yard.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 9.-The
naval appropriation bill for tne coming
fiscal year was reported to the Senate to
day. The four seagoing battle-ships, au
thorized in the House bill, are left un
touched. Amendments have been made,
however, in the provisions for torpedo
boats. Insiead of hve capable of attain
ing a speed of twenty-six knots, as pro
vided by the House, the Senate has sub
stituted three torpedo-boats which will in
reality be torpedo-boat catchers with a
maximum speed of not less than thirty
knots an hour. In place of ten or more
torpedo-boat 3, to cost not exceeding $800,
--000 and to have the hi-hest practicable
speed for vessels of their class, the Senate
has substituted a provision for "not to
exceed ten torpedo-boats to cost in all not
exceeding $500,000 and to have the highest
practicable speed for vessels of their class."
A proviso is also inserted as follows:
"And not more than two of said battle
ships and not more than three of said
torpedo-boats shall be built in one yard or
by one contracting party, and in each case
tne contract shall be awarded by the
Secretary of the Navy to the lowest
responsible bidder."
The House proviso requiring one of the
battle-ships to be built on the Pacific
Coast is restricted by a provision that in
order to do so it must be constructe 1 at an
additional cost not exceeding 5 per cent of
the lowest bid for the other three battle
ships authurized. The time within which
the contracts for these vessels shall be
made is extended from ninety to 120 days
from the passage of the act.
The bill as reported by the committee
carries a total reduction of $152,958 and a
total increase of $'}5,"_'00, making a net re
duction of $367,757. The estimates forlS97
were $29,313,1.76 and the House appro
priated $31,674,239, which was reduced by
the Senate to $:J1 ,279,482.
VACANCIES IN THE HA.VJ.
There Are Plenty of Placet for the Cadets
to HU.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 9.â A Times
Washington special says: The six-year
men from the Naval Academy will get
places this year. The probability is that
tnere will be more places than men to fill
them. For several years it has been
necessary under the Jaw to dismiss a
number of graduates with a year's pay
because there was no room for them. The
vacancies are not caused by an unusual
number of deaths or resignations, but by
the retirement of young officers for dis
ability. T);ere are now nineteen vacancies
in the line, twenty-five in the engineer
corps and one in the marine corps.
The class about to graduate numbers
thirty-three. A percentage will probably
fall, out it is believed that there will be at
least thirty graduates for from forty-live to
forty-seven vacancies. After the qualified
members of the graduating class have been
provided, the vacancies not lilled will
remain open to be filled next year.
Already it is apparent that the quota for
the engineers will not be filled, and
Engineer Melville, who has been very
solicitous about the prospect of main
taining the efficiency of the corps of which
he is the head, is of the opinion that the
number of cadets should be admitted from
some of the technical schools.

MANTLE DEFENDS
SILVER SENATORS
Explains the Defeat of the
Dingley Tariff
Bill.
FREE COINAGE DESIRED.
Maiden Speech of the Montana
Statesman Attracts Great
Attention.
PRIVATE PENSION BILLS PASS.
Seventy-Five of Them Rushed Through
Within a Period of Sixty
Minutas.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 9.-Tbe
Senate did a rushing business in the way
of private pension bills in the last hour of
to-day's session, having cleared the calen
dar and passed every pension bill on it â
seventy-live in number â within sixty min
utes. The earlier hour 3of the session
were taken up in the delivery of two pre
pared speechesâ one by Mantle of Mon
tana and the other by Butler of North
Carolina. Mantle' 3 speech was mainly a
defense of the Senators from the silver
producing States for their action in help
ing to defeat the Dinzley tariff bill, passed
by the House in the early part of the ses
sion. He criticized the Dill for being in
the interest of the wool-manufacturers
rather than of the wool-growers, and he
declared himself as being equally in favor
of bimetallism and of protection to Amer
ican industry. He expressed tne hope,
therefore, that the Finance Committee
would report back a fair tariff bill, coupled
with a provision for free coinage.
At the close of Mantle's speech, his
maiden one in the Senate, he received the
congratulations of many Senators, and
then participated in a running discussion
with Senators Hawley of Connecticut,
Hoar of Massachusetts and Mills of Texas,
the latter characterizing a protective tariff
as a protective humbug.
Butler's speech was in support of a bill
heretofore introduced by him for the es
tablishment of a postal telegraph system.
Between the close of Butler's speech and
tne taking up of the pension bills the; In
dian appropriation bill made some prog
ress.
Frye (R.^ of Maine, chairman of the
Committee on Commerce, gave notice to
hear any Senators who might desire tc
propose amendments to the river and har
bor bill, and that the committee would
not hear any afterward.
Mantle (R.) of Montana addressed the
Senate in support of a resolution here
tofore offered by his colleague, Carter, to
recommit to the Finance Committee the
House tariff bill passed in the early days
of the session. He spoke of the unwar
ranted aspersions cast by the metropolitan
press on the Senators wno favored silver
coinage and who voted in opposition to
tnat bill, and he defended those Senators
and the people of the .silver States from
the indiscriminate charges of selfishness
and lack of patriotism brought against
them.
Mantle argued against the Dingley bill,
declaring that while it professed to be in
the interest of the wooigrowers it was
really in the interest of the wool manufac
turers. A tariff bill, he said, should be so
adjusted as to guard every American in
dustry that needed sheltering arms to
shield it from the degrading competition
of other lands. He admitted that while
he was an ardetit believer in the principle
of protection he was an ardent believer in
the advantages of bimetallism, and with
out bimetallism a protective tariff could not
guard aeainat the competition that ia com
ing and to come from China and Japan.
Unless a parity was established between
gold and silver one of two things, he said,
must inevitably happen: Either the
wages and standard of living in Asia must
be raised to the American level or else the
wages and standard of living in the United
States should be reduced to theirs. He
was therefore in favor of uniting the poli
cies of bimetallism and protection. He
declared that the Republican silver Sena
tors would have been "as fully justitied in
aiding the Democrats to repeal the Me-
Kinley law as other Republican Senators
were in joining the administration Demo
crats to secure the unconditional repeal of
the Sherman law."
In conclusion he expressed the hope that
the resolution would be agreed to, and that
the Dingley bill would bo reported back
with a fair protective substitute and with
a provisiou for bimetallism. The Repub
lican party, he said, would go into history
as the best and bravest party that the
world had ever known, and he had hopes
that it would refuse to be guided in its fu
ture policy by the dictates of sellishness
and greed.
Hawley (R.) of Connecticut said that he
had a fe.v figures which proved that
Mantle was mistaken in supposing that
the wool manufacturers were benefited by
the Wilson tariff bill. The importations
of woolen manufactured goods into the
United Status for the current fiscal year,
including January, amounted to over $38,
--000,000 as against $17,500,000 in the corre
sponding seven months of last year. On
the other hand many looms in New Eng
land woolen-mills were idle and the mills
were running on reduced time. With the
passage of the Wilson tariff law, a cyclone,
he said, had struck the woolen industry
of New England. He added that he did
not call to mind a single New England
Senator who had ever moved or voted to
take the duty off raw wool.
After considerable discussion the nSatter
went over. *
Unanimous consent was asked by Allen
(Pop.) of Nebraska for the passage of
the Senate bill to authorize and encourage
the holding of a trans-Mississippi expo
sition in Omaha, Nebr., in 1898. It was
made the special order for to-morrow
after the morning routine business.
At 5:15 the Senate adjourned until to
morrow.

"WASHINGTON, D. C, April 9.â The
House Committee on Labor to-day beard
arguments by James O'Connell of Chicago,
grand master of the Machinists' Union,
and Mr. Gompers of the Federation of
Labor in support of the bill of Mr. South
wick of New York prohibiting interstate
traffic in the products of convict labor.
They also advocated the Government
eight-hour law bills.
SENATOR MORGAN VERY ILL
His Death Would Be a Severe Blow to Those
Who Are Fighting the Refunding
Scheme.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 9.â Senator
Morgan is critically ill. and it is doubtful
whether he can live. He realizes the seri
ousness of his condition, and has made all
preparations in anticipation of his death.
While in conversation with Californians,
Senator Morgan imparted to them the
grave fears he entertained that he would
never be well again.
This will be a severe blow to California,
and all those who have relied upon Mor
gan's splendid ability to combat the re
funding bill in the Senate. He and Rep
resentative Maguire had decided to pre
pare a bill on the lines of his resolution
leaving the Pacific roads debt question to
be adjudicated by the courts.
Whether Morgan recovers or not, it is
not probable that hewiil be able to resume
his seat in the Senate for many weeks. If
there aupears.to be reasonable probability
of his attending to his public duties at this
session, his friends will ask that considera
tion of Pacific roads legislation in the
Senate t>e postponed until he can partici
pate in the debate.
This request is one that could hardly be
refused, so unless Senator Morgan shall
die his illness may be the means of post
poning the matter until the next session
of Congress.

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 9.â The

large appropriation and provides in such
a liberal manner for the purchase uuder
contract of sites, guns, etc., that it is stated
that the War Department will be able to
enter upon an extensive system of coast
defenses lor the next year.
Z.*ague of Musicians.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 9.â The

large balance to the credit of the benefit
fund and nearly $2000 in the league

ASSISTED BY ANDRADE
The Venezuelan Minister Is
Gathering Some Importan-
Documents.
Thousands of Pages of Mattel Bearing
on the Dispute Will Be
Translated.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 9.-Mal
lette-Frevost has had a conference at the
Venezuelan legation with Minister An
drade relative to the translation and print
ing of the documents recently received by
Mr. Andrade on the subject of the bound
ary dispute between Venezuela and Brit
ish Guiana. Owing to the fact that it has
not yet been possible to make and print
translations of these documents they have
not been formally presented to the com
mission. It is the intention of Mr. An
drade to submit both the ori inal aocu
ments and the printed translations as
soon as they can be prepared.
The following will serve to give some
idea regarding the extent and importance
of these documents. They are contained
in three large folio volumes and comprise
from 1000 to lUOO closely written pa^es.
Most of them are in the form of certified
copies of original manuscripts on file in
the archives at Seville, Simancas and
Madrid. Many documents cited and
quoted by the British Government in the
bluebook recently presented to Parlia
ment are in that book given only in the
form of extracts.
tome of the documents now in the
hands of Mr. Andrade are complete copies
of these same papers, and will therefore
enable the commission to form a much
more accurate idea with regard to their
exact meaning and value. In some cases
the extracts given in the bluebook are
exceedingly meager; as for instance, in the
ease of the report sent by the Governor of
Cumana, Don Jose Dijjuja, on December
15, 1763. The extracts from this report
are given in the bluebook and cover two
and a half pages. The original report, a
certified copy of which is now at the Vene
zuelan legation, contains nearly 400 pages.
The translation of these documonts will
necessarily occupy some weeks, as the
interpretation of the technical language
used for le^al documents in the sixteenth,
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in
which they are couched, requires more
than ordinary skill and care.
In addition to the three quarto volumes
mentioned, Mr. Andrade states that in the
course of two or three weeks he expects to
receive from the Venezuelan legations at
The Hague, Rome and Madrid copies of
further documents, which agents of his
Govertment have been engaged in collect
ing.
ADSIISSIOIi OF TERRITORIES.
Eadley Presents a favorable Report on
the Arizona Mill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 9.â When
the bill admitting New Mexico was taken
up in the House to-day Owens of Ken
tucky offered an amendment postponing
the election of the State Legislature until
1898, the purpose being to delay the elec
tion of a United States Senator to a subse
quent period, but this was rejected, as was
also an amendment offered by Taft of
Ohio to report the bill to the House with
out recommendation.
Hadley prevented a favorable report on
the Arizona bill. He stated that, his ac
tion in voting to admit Territories would
be based on the ratio of pupulation, and
as Arizona did not have, in his opinion,
the number of inhabitants required for
statehood, he would be compelled to vote
against it. Under these circumstances
Murphy, the delegate from Arizona,
deemed it advisable not to press the matter
further at to-day's meeting, and upon mo
tion of Catron, the delegate from New
Mexico, the Arizona bill was laid aside
and the New Mexico bill taken up. On
thin bill the committee divided on the lines
given above, but it was carried by a vote
of six to four, those voting in the negative
being Taft, Owens, Knox and Low.
Hoimdary of Alaska,
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 9.â The

PILOTAGE BILL
MEETS DEFEAT
The House Not Inclined to
Increase the Distress
of Labor.
ATTACK ON THE A. P. A.
Fitzgerald of Massachusetts Says
Catholic Institutions Are
Not Treated Fairly,
REFERRED TO A CONFERENCE.
Agreement Net Reached on Senate
Amendments to Postoffice Ap
propriation?..
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 9.â The
bill to repeal the compulsory pilotage sys
tem, so far as it affects saiiing vessels en
gaged in the coastwise trade, was defeated
in the House to-day, after a day's debate,
by a vote of 117 to 152. Grosvenor (R.) of
Ohio in the course of the discussion said
that while this Congress would not enact
any legislation intended to improve the
condition of laboring men in this country,
lie was certain the House would not pass a
bill which laboring men believed would
tend to still further increase the distress
and discomfort of a portion of their fellows.
The amended District of Columbia ap
propriation bill for the year ending June
30, 1897, was passed after a brief debate.
The most notable incident of the debate
was a bitter attack by Fitzgerald (D.) of
Massachusetts, upon the A. P. A. for its
attack i.i the dark, as he expressed it, upon
the Horn an Catholic church, of which he
was a member, which resulted in depriv
ing institutions in the District of Colum
bia, conducted under the auspices of tue
church, of what was justly and legally
theirs.
No response was made to Fitzgerald be
yond a bare denial by Grout (R.) of Ver
mont, in charge of the bill, that it consti
tuted in any sense an attack upon the
Catholic church. The vote upon the bill
was K54 to 21, and only twenty members,
an insufficient number, joined with Sulzer
(D.) of New York in a demand for a vote
by ayes and noes.
Conference was ordered on the {senate
amendments to the postofiice appropria
tion bill.
Consideration was begun of the "filled
cheese" bill (imposing a tax upon its
manufacture and sale) and will be contin
ued to-morrow. Cooke(R.)of Wisconsin,
author of one of the bills for wnich the
pending bill was a substitute, addressed
ihe House.
The House upon meeting resumed con
sideration ol the bill to aboli.sh the com
pulsory pilotage system so far as it relates
to sailing vessels engaged in the coastwise
trade.
Cooper (D.) of Florida, who prepared the
views of the minority of the Committee on
Merchant Marine and Fisheries in oppo
sition to the bill, made the tirst speech.
The bill was advocated by Perkins (R.)
of lowa and Fitzgerald (D.) of Massachu
setts, Eilert (D.) of Pennsylvania, Dincley
(R.)of Maine and Payne (R.) of New
York, ami antagonized by Grosvenor (R.)
of Ohic, Elliott (D,) of South Carolina and
Tyler (D.) of Virginia. The bill was de
featedâll7 to 152.
An effort to get a vote by ayes and noes
was successful.
The bill making appropriations for the
District of. Columbia for the year ending
June 30, 1597, was taken up. The discus
sion of the bill was interrupted to pass the
resolution asking the Secretary of State to
give the House any information the de
partment might have regarding the case
of Mrs. Florence E. Maybrick, in prison in
England for poisoning her husband, a
merchant of Liverpool.
Bartlett and Wheeler (D.) of Ala
bama opposed the district bill, the former
on the ground that the appropriations for
charity should be made as in the past,
directly to the institutions, and the latter
for the reason that the cost of caring for
ttie poor of the district would be largely
increased under the new system.
Fitzgerald (D.) of Massachusetts, the
youthful sole representative of his party
from the New England States, briefly ad

MISS EFFIE PER BIN! OF SALINAS,
SALINAS, Monterey County. Cal.
I have never met a more enthusiastic
class of people than I did in Salinas, and
in fact all through Monterey County.
One of the most pleasing gentlemen with
whom I talked is Mr. George Perrinl. He
told me that he had heard of many re-
markable cures that had been effected by
the use of Joy's Vegetable Sars'aparilla,
and that he had occasion to prove this to
his own advantage.
Some time ago his little daughter, Effie
Perrini, was covered with small sores. A
bottle of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla was
bought and very moderate doses, were
given to the little girl. Before the entire
bottle was exhausted all the sores had dis-
appeared and Eflie got better. She con-
tinued to improve until she is now a per-
fectly healthy child. He told me that he
had recommended Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilia to many people and that every one
was now praising the native remedy.

INVASION OF ASIATICS.
On ihe Hawaiian Islands It Has
Reduced Labor to a Pau

BOWIE AGAIN AT HONOLULU.
S eamships Emp'oying the Physician
to Be Overhauled by Health
Authorities.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, April 2.â On the
morning of the 26th, after several prelim
inary meetings, nearly 700 Portuguese
men marched in a body to the Govern
ment building and sent in a petition ad
dressed to tlie President and Legislature.
Their demeanor was entirely peaceable
and orderly. Copies of the petition were
at once made and presented to the two
houses of the Legislature. The grievance
of the Portuguese is that having been
brought here by this Government and
having settled in the islands and now in
creased to 13,000 souls they find themselves
subjected to an invasion of Chinese and
Japanese immigrants, now over 40,000,
which has reduced the wages of labor be
low the cost of subsistence to Europeans.
They ask for measures to restrict Asiatic
immigration, also for a more tquitable
system of taxation.
While no apprehension of disorder was
felt from the gathering of Portuguese, it
is considered a bad precedent for the Leg
islature to be approached by a large as
semblage, and liable to have a menacing
tendency, calculated to disturb and intim
idate the Legislature, especially if the
Japanese should be induced to make a
similar demonstration. It may be thought
best to prohibit by law the presenting of
petitions in this manner.
A registration act has nearly completed
its passage by the two houses with ereat
unanimity. A similar act passed the Leg
islator* of 1892, but was lost on its way to
ti^e Queen by some unknown means. This
act compels every male above 15 years to
be registered, with full description and
thumb mark; also to produce his certifi
cate of registration whenever he removed
to a new location. The object of tnis
measure is to enable the Government to
identify and control the great number of
A.-;at:c vagrants in the country. It is es
t:mater; that $45,000 will annually be col
lected from Asiatics -who have hitherto
<. taxation. While the whites gen
favor this law. a few are opposed to
it on sentimental grounds, as savoring of
I c ir. despotism. Minister Damon
Btrenno i-'y <>pp^std it on this ground,
fcuch a iaw is generally considered indis
pensable to any proper control of the
A-iatic population, who are extremely dif
ficuit to identify.
Finance Minister Damon is encounter
ing a strong opposition to certain acts
â which he has introduc-d into the Legisla
ture for consolidating the public debt by
new issue of bonds at a lower rate of inter
est; also for negotiating a new loan of
$'-',000,000 for public iniDrovements and
education, the bonds to be issued at not
exceeding $250,000 per annum. At a con
ference held on the 31st ult. by the Senate
with leading financial men of Honolulu,
the latter were unanimously opposed to
the method proposed by Damon. While
favoring the objects of the acts, these gen
tlemen objected to the large discount pro
posed of 15 per cent in case the bonds were
sold at 4 per cent interest to replace the
present $3,005,000 of bonds at 6 per cent.
They aiso objected to the negotiations of
the loans in London, contending that
much of the money could be obtained in
Honolulu itself, especially now that large
eugar dividends were being received.
Many persons, not investors, but seeking
to borrow, favor Damon's measure, as
tending to lower the present high rates of
interest asked by Honolulu capitalists.
The citizens of Hilo have sent a com
nmtee .to the Legislature with strong
resolutions aemanding a larger share of
appropriations for public improvements in
that district.
The Belgic arrived on the 28th, bringing
as her surgeon the same Dr. Bowie who
last August caused the disastrous cbolera
epidemrc by concealing trie fact of deaths
from cholera on the Belgic's passage from
Japan. The port physician therefore
anchored the ship outside while he per
sonally inspected every passenger. Find
ing-a Chinese leper, of whom Bowie knew
nothing, he brought the surgeon ashore to
n-eet the Board of Health, with whom
Bowie had no agreeable interview. The
Beigic was detained three hours outside
the harbor. The agents of the steamship
company have been notified that any
ship employing Dr. Bowie will be liable

tion.

Tucker was charged with extortion for
having frightened a man named Larsen
into parting with $140 by representing that
he was an officer and that he had a warrant
for Larsen 's arrest on a charge of horse
stealing. He agreed to compromise the

with his money. Tucker was tried on an
information tiled by the District Attorney
and the jury disagreed. He was then in
dicted by the Grand Jury and giv'en his
trial yesterday and to-day, the jury bring
ing in a verdict of guilty. But in submit
ting the case the plea of once in jeopardy

the papers in the case as tlie plea iiled in
writing was not in ihe box wiien Judge
Smith examined the pacers the opening
day of the trial. Tucfcer belongs to a gang

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 10, 1896.
IN FAVOR OF
SOUND MONEY
Bankers of Maryland Put
Themselves Squarely
on Record.
FOR A GOLD STANDARD.
Enemies of Free Coinage Talk
About the True Interests of
the Nation.
COMPTROLLER ECKELS SPEAKS.
Backs Up the Policy of the Demo.
cratic Administration and
Wall Street.
BALTIMORE, Md., April 9. â The
â¢bankers of Maryland to-day put them
selves squarely on record in favor of sound
money. In a convention, with delegates
representing almost every bank of any
size in the State, the following resolution
was adopted without a dissenting vote:
Resolved. That we are unalterably opposed to
the free coinage of silver and to every debase
ment of our currency in whatsoever form it
maybe presented: that we firmly and honestly
believe that the true interests oi our country
will be best served by its rigid adherence to the
gold standard ot value, the continuance of which
will not only preserve its financial integrity
and the future welfare of its citizens, from the
wage-earner to the capitalist, but will insure,
through the prompt restoration of confidence,
that rapid development of Its resources which
will eventually place it first among: the nation!
of the earth.
James, H. Eckels, Comptroller of the
Currency, was the principal speaker of the
day. Among other things he said:
"Our credit is maintained by what we
set up as our standard of value, upon
which we shall base the transactions and
the contracts which we are to carry out.
The people who are dealing with us abroad
not less than the people who are transacting
business here at home, take their estimate
of our financial integrity by the financial
standard of the Government which we
support, and which we control in im
portant deta:!Â«. If the United States should
set up a standard of value which cheapens
the present one, which makes a subject of
inquir3 r and of constant questioning
whether or not the Government shall
maintain the payment of its obligations
in tne oniy standard of value which is
recognized in the commercial world, all
the financial integrity of the individual
citizen in his individual capacity could
not save this country from a state of finan
cial collapse.
"If we are to maintain commercial rela
i tion? with the greatest people of the worid,
and if our products are to be sold to them
and we are to secure products from
them we must have as a standard of value
' not that which the law says is a
standard of value simply, but we
must have as a standard of value which
the commercial world recognizes as the
only standard of value. [Applause.] The
fiat of the Government is one thing; actual
value as approved of by the commercial
world is another, and in all the contests
' which have been witnessed from the first
' day that the first medium of
: exchange was invented until the present,
1 the commercial world has been indifferent
to what the law has said, and has had as
its sole rule and guide the value of the
thing which is used as a standard of value
and medium of exchange, and
: the record of the commercial world
from the first day until the present time is
: that no article has ever been used for a
medium of exchange beyond the time
when, as an article of commerce, it also
had the same value that it had as an
â â  article of money. [Applause. J
"Silver metal has passed from the world
I of commerce as a standard of value be
| cause the commercial world has set its
seal of condemnation upon it and all the
laws placed upon the statute books in
"Washington or Westminster, or in Ber
lin, or in Paris, cannot reinstate
'[ it. [Applause.] The silver people in
this contest will be beaten through
the strugsle may be prolonged and ex
, pensive. Expensive from the very fuct
that here at home there is a serious sus
j picion that the standard of value which
has been so long in vogue shall be changed
is sufficient of itself to work the greatest
j harm to the business world. It will be beat
j en because there never has yet been a con
j test before the American people upon any
! great question, whether it was a question
; of morals or a question of money, but that
at the critical time, no matter how far the
! error may seem to have gone, the common
-1 sense of the American people asserted it
| self and the right thing always prevailed.
j [Applause.]
"A free silver act never can pass both
houses of the American Congress at the
same period, [applause] and if it did the
American people will never send to Wash
ington, indorsed by the vote of the people
sufficient to elect, a president who would
give official sanction to such an act."
The convention adopted a constitution
and by-laws, elected officers and adjourned
to the Hotel Rennert for a banquet.

CHOICE OF THE LIQUOR ME\.
Halle Says McKinley Has Sever Opposed
Their Interest*.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, April 9.â Robert J.
Halle of Chicago, general secretary of the
National Retail Liquor-dealers' Associa
tion, is in Cleveland arranging with the
Ohio executive Doard for the National
convention of the association to be held in
this city next fall. Speaking of the politi
cal attitude of the association, Mr. Halle
said:
"The saloon interests in every part of
the United States favor the nomination of
William McKinley for the Presidency.
This means the support of the liquor-deal
ers in the district, State and National con
ventions, and at the lowest calculation
1.800,000 votes at the polls if McKinley is
nominated, I base this estimate on the
fact that the association has 180,000 mem
bers, and each, member is good for ten
votes at least."
Mr. Halle, continuing, stated that the
love of the liquor men for McKinley was
owing to the fact that he had never placed
himself in opposition to the liquor traffic
and had never favored measures opposed
to the interests of saloon-keepers, as had
Reed, Morton and Allison.
"McKinley," continued Mr. Halle, "ap
preciates the fact that the liquor traffic is
a great industry, and act? accordingly."

Chinese laundry near University station
to get some clothes belonging to a lady
which the Chinamen refused to give up,
claiming that she owed them $14. John
ston ordered them to band over the goods
and call at his office for the money. At
the time there were six Chinamen present.

Johnston was about to take possession,
when one of the Chinamen attacked him
in front and another in the rear. The one
in the rear dealt the officer a terrible blow
in the back of the head which staggered

to get done up, pulled out his nun, and
backing against the wall he soon had the
Chinamen subdued, and succeeded in cap
turing the one who assaulted him.

THE AGITATION
FOR SAN PEDRO.
Increasing Interest in the
Deep â¢ Sea Harbor
Fight.
POWERFUL ARGUMENTS
A Railroad From Salt Lake
to Los Angeles Is
Assured.
PEOPLE ARE SET TO THINKING
Huntington's Mass â¢ Meeting Was
Packed With Empoyes and
Santa Mcnicans.
LOS ANGELES, Cat-, April 9.â lnterest
in the harbor question has in no wise sub
sided since the outpouring at last night's
mass-meetings. The agitation has devel
oped to a large extent into the thrashing
over of old straw. Public sentiment, how
ever, remains as it was from the beginning
â almost unanimous in â¢ favor of San
Pedroâ not that they love Santa Monica
less, but that they love a harbor to which
all railroads can have access.
A powerful argument in favor of San
Pedro is that work on a deep-sea harbor
there means the construction of another
transcontinental line.
At the free-harbor mass-meeting last
night Hon. T. E. Gibbon, vice-president of
the Terminal Railway, promised that with
in twelve months from to-day, if an ap
propriation was made for a deep-sea
harbor at San Pedro, work would be com
menced on a railroad from Salt Lake to
Los Angeles. He said he made this
promise authoritatively and in good faith.
The vast majority ot people here believe
that the ultimate building of the Salt
Lake road depends upon improved harbor
facilities at San Pedro, hence their opposi
tion to Huntington's scheme to induce the
Government to build the harbor at Santa
Monica, thus practically excluding all
roads but the Southern Pacific; from its
benefits.
Another thing that has set the people to
thinking is the alleged control that Hunt
ington has secured of the Atlantic and
Pacific, thus shutting the Santa Fc'a sys
tem out of Southern California and plac
ing this end of the State as completely in
the power of the Southern Pacific
monopoly as Northern California now is.
It is for potent reasons like these that
the people of Los Angeles spurn an appro
priation for Santa Monica if it is to be se
cured at the price of sacrificing the chances
of San Pedro to obtain an appropriation
for a deep harbor, which would be the in
evitable result.
Much comment has been occasioned by
the fact that the ruass-raoetine at Illinois
Hall last night v;as packed with Southern
Pacific employes and a trainload of Santa
Monicans. The attendance at this meeting
has been estimated at 2000. bat as a matter
of fact the hall's seating capacity is only
800. It is truo that a good many people
from Sa:> Pedro and Long Beach were at
the free-harbor outdoor mass-meeting, but
the vast majority of the throne, which
numbered fully 5000, was made up of tax
payers oi Los Anireles City.
WOMAS S I'JriiAGISTS.
.WaÂ»i Coiirfiid'ow Closed With an Ad-
drrs* bt/ Her. Anna Miato.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 9.â The Los
Angeles County Woman suffrage mass
convention, held under the auspices of the
constitutional campaign committee of the
California Woman Suffrage Association,
closed this evening with an address by
Key. Anna H. Shaw, who delivered one of
her characteristic discourses on her favor
ite topic.
Music Hall was crowded with members
of both sexes, who applauded the points
scored by the speaker at frequent inter
vals.
During the two days' session of the con
vention addresses were made by Mrs. Mila
T. Maynard, Miss Elizabeth U. Yates of
Maine, Mary G. Hay and others.
Papers xere read by Dr. Kate C. Moody
on "The Professional Woman's Need of
the Ballot," Eliza Tupper Wilkes on "The
Ballot for the Wife and Mother' and Mrs.
Caroline Severance on "Does the State
Need Woman's Ballot?"
Mary G. Hay enlightened the conven
tion on the practical work of campaign of
woman suffrage in the State. The cus
tomary resolutions common to sucn con
ventions were passed, and the delibera
tions came to an end with the general
feeling on the part of those who partici
pated that the cause of woman suffrage
was materially advanced by the actions of
these earnest workers.
OREGON CONVENTIONS.
Republican and Democratic State
Delegates Convene at
Portland.
After a Hot Fight the Free-Silver
Democrats Capture Their
Organization.
PORTLAND. Or., April 9.-Chairman
George A. Steel of the State Central Com
mittee called the State Republican Con
vention to order at 11 o'clock with 237
delegates present. General George H.
Wiiimms was elected permanent chairman
of the convention. The venerable states
man was enthusiastically cheered.
The appointment of the committees on
Organization and credentials was the only
work done, and the convention then ad
journed until :: i\ m.
The feature of the State Republican Con
vention to-day was the continued wranele
between two factions of the Multnomah
delegation which took up the entire after
noon in having a hearing before the
credentials commute. The convention
adjourned to-night until to-morrow with
out making any nominations.
Late this evsntag a compromise was ef
lected, as in the Congressional Convention
yesterday, by the credentials committee
making the suggestion to seat both dele
gationsâone representing the Carey fac
tion and the other Joseph Simon. The
committee were five for seating Biitton, one
for Carey and one for seating both delega
tions. When this had been done the mo
tion to adjourn till to-morrow was carried.
Speeches were made counseling har
mony in the Republican rants. Interest
in the proceedings oi the convention cen
tered in the outcome of the contest in the
Multnomah delegation.
The business of the convention is to
elect four Presidential electors, State and
district officers, except Congressmen, and
four delegates to the National Convention,
over which there will be a lively contest.
There is no contention over the Supreme
Judgeship, and it is expected other offices
will be tilled without trouble.

der at 11 o'clock. P. H. Darcey of Salem
was elected temporary chairman.
Committees on credentials, order of
business and resolutions were appointed,
and an adjournment taken till 2 p. m.
Free silver and plenty of it seems to be
the shibboleth of the convention to-day.
At a caucus it is understood it was deter
mined to ignore all aspirants for favors
who did not unqualifiedly subscribe to the
16 to 1 articles of faith.
By a vote of I.tO to 90 the delegates to
the State Democratic convention this
afternoon got a free-silver plank In the
platform adopted. Notwithstanding the
opposition manifested by the sound-money
men at to-ninht's meeting, free-silver dele
gates to the National convention were
elected. They are W. F. Bucher, Charles
Nicoll, M. A. Miller, D. Mutlinx, Dr.
Welch, j. L. Townsend, J. W. Howard
and J. D.McKinnon.
The Multnomah County delegation,
which was supposed to be pretty evenly
divided on the financial question, in voting
for their man on the platform and resolu
tions committee stood twenty-four for
Bound money, eleven for silver and one
straddler. Six of the delegates pledged
for free silver voted for Benton Kiilin, one
of the most pronounced sound-money men
in the convention.
After the selection of National delegates
an adjournment was taken till to-morrow
to complete business.

M'RAE IN COURT.
The Preliminary Examination of Trade's
Assailant Concluded.
The preliminary examination of J. D.
McÃae, charged with assault to murder
Peter Trade in a building on Post street,
near Larkin, on March 10, was concluded
before Judge Low yesterday afternoon.
Four witnesses for the defense, William
Storm, A. Nichols, T. Devilliers and W.
Pettee, all testilied that McÃae was not in
the room at the time Trade was assaulted,
and could not therefore have struck him
with a hatchet-handle.
The prosecuting attorneys in the argu
ment attempted to show that there was a
conspiracy to assault Trade and the other
men at work with him, but Attorney Gal
lagher for the defense contended that
nothing had been brought out in the evi
dence to warrant such an assumption and
there was not a particle of evidence that
McÃae was guilty of the charge made
against him.
The Judge said he would reserve his de
cision till to-day.

A meeting of the Musicians' Union was
held yesterday and it was decided to re
main in the San Francisco Trades Council

SANTA ROSA. Cal., April 9.â The
queen contest now begins to grew interest
ing. Lust night the two fair rivals for car
nival honors were even for some time, till
a $f> note added 100 to the score of Mrs.
Burris. The next envelope was for the
lady from the led woods. Miss Jessica
Kloppenburg, and added 40 for that popu
lar candidate. The last message in the
box was an innocent-looking carnival en
velope, on which the two little bears
seemed to be Btrnggling to hide the pov
erty of its contents, but the ten-dollar gold
piece that rolled out for Miss Sara Hall
surprised Chairman Lewis of the counting
committee exceedingly and placed Miss
Hall 100 to the good.
To-night some of the most influential
citizens in town elbowed their way ii.to
the store of C. A. Wriglit & Co. to see the
votes counted. Although there wan no
gold in the box there was a goodly num
ber of envelopes containing the white
metal, aggregating about 300 votes. By
tens and twenties the votes were placed
opposite the rival beauties' names, and it
was not until the last envelope was opened
that it was definitely known that Mrs.
Burris had aeain resumed the lead.

This last compliment to Mrs. Burris was
1 a poor, lonely white two-bit piece, but the
block of five votes repiesented by this
' small coin turned the tide and left the
j last-named lady one vote in the lead.
The rumor of a big sack from the red
woods still floats into town periodically,
but causes no uneasiness to the Santa Rosa
candidates, who have implicit faith in the
loyalty of the citizens of this city.
But a $20 piece would place tne lady
from the lumber region right up with the
leaders, and Charles Orr, late of Duncans
Mills, claims to have the proceeds of 5000
pickets and numerous bunules of shades to
uphold the dignity of Occidental with,
and Charles Rule, also of Duncans Mills,
declares that the returns from the naxt
consignment of butter from the Rule ranch
will add to the score of the lady from the
land of big trees.
SAX JOSE'S ACTIVITY.
The Splendid Proyratntne in Prepara-
tintt for the Carnival.
SAN JOSE, Cal., April 9.â At a meet
ing of the executive committee of the Car
nival of Roses, held this evening, there
were reports from a number of commit
tees and the arrangements for the great
entertainment were found to be almost
complete.
Details of a splendid programme for the
! entertainment of the visitors during the
; lour days of the carnival were reported.
â  A committee was appointed to canvass the
i hotels, restaurants, lodging-houses and
I livery stables of the city and learn the
I names of all those who will furnish enter
i tainment and also those who will agree to
j preserve tue regular rates.
The names of all those who will not
j agree to preserve the regular rates will also
!be secured. It is the intention of the ex
! eoutive committee that the guests at the
: carnival shall be protected from extortion.
It was reported that a larpe number of
j owners of fine rigs would furnish many
i elaborately drcorated rigs for the parade.
A resolution of thanks was voted to C.
| M. Shortridge for the publication of the
I carnival edition of tiie Mercury, and also
| for the liberal donation of copies of that
I edition for the use of the executive com
j mittee. It was expressed as the sense of
the committee that "the extensive circu
lation of this number of the Mercury
throughout the country wilJ materially
aid in bringing visitors to the carnival."
A report was made by the San Jose Turn
Verein of entertainments to be given dur
ing carnival week by that organization.
MAST ACRES OF FLOWERS.
ban Jose Is Growing Enough for All of
the Carnivals.
SAN JOSE. Cal., April 9.â The many
acres planted to sweet-peas, mangolds
and roses throughout the country for car
nival purposes are in a flourishing con
dition, and it is now certain there will be
plenty of flowers for decoration purposes
during the great lloral fete. The warm
showers of the past month have proved of
groat benefit. The sweet-pea vines are
well up and beginning 10 bloom.
The vines will continue In blossom for a
number of weeks and will be at their
height during the carnival.
A large area of marigolds has been
planted and there will be an immense
quantity of these brilliant oranged-hued
Jlowers. They are juat beginning to come
in bloom. There will also be large quan
tities of marguerites, callas, geraniums,
verbenas, locusts and poppies available for
carnival purposes.
Roses are blooming profusply and there
promises to be an unstinted supply of the
choicest varieties.
CIJICO I'Kt'.TTX OIJILS.
Many lirought to thÂ« Front Daily for
Queen of May.
CHICO, Cal., April 9.-The pretty
young ladies of Chico are being brought
to the front in the contest to decide the
question as to who shall be the Queen of
May on the occasion of the Mayday picnic.
The admirers of the several candidates
are working with a will to secure the elec-
i tion of their favorite, and each day votes
in large numbers are finding their way
into the several ballot-boxes. Up to the
; present time Miss Frieda Junkans, a very
: popular and handsome young lady, leads
the list by about 100 votes, her nearest
i opponent being Miss Clara Cussick.
From present indications a large major
ity of votes are being Jield back, nrepara
! Tory to a grand rush toward the close of
i tlie contest. It is known that there are a
number of young women whose friends
will attempt at least to secure the honor of
: Queen of May, but as yet no ballots have
! been cast for their, and this naturally
! keeps Miss Junkans friends on an anxious
) seat.
Another feature that will tend to draw
votes is the selection of two ruaids of honor
for the queen. These positions, second
oajy on Mayday to the queen herself, will
be given to the two young ladies oeiug in
the second and third places on the final
count.
Should the affair prove as popular as
thought from the contest as appearances
show to-ni^ht, many dollars will find
themselves in the funds of the picnic com
mittee, and the vote will reach in the
neighborhood of thousands.
Sunset Telephones for St. Helena.
ST. HELENA, Cal., April 9.â The Sun
set Telephone Company has a gang of men
in town to-day installing a local telephone
circuit. Almost all the business men of
the town have taken a phone, which
places them in direct communication with
all towns on the company's system.
Frightful Xitro- Glycerine Explosion.
NANAIMO, B. C, April 9.â Five hun
dred pounds of nitro-glycerine being
hauled from Northfield to Departure Bay
exploded this afternoon, killing the team
ster and his two horses and shattering the
wagon to fragments.

The Present Trouble Precipitated by the
Oregon Ushcrmen.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 9.â The troops
that, left here to-day will be stationed on
Bakers Bay, near the mouth of the Colum
bia River, the scene of the depreda
tions, which began a week a<;o. They
were accompanied by Brigadier-General
E. M. Carr, though in the fi?M Cattiin
Frank E. Adams will be in command.' The
detachment took rations for icn ilÂ«vÂ«.
For five or six years there has been more
or less bad blood between the Oregon and
W*Â»bit>gtoo rishermen alontr the Columbia
River, due chiefly to the difference in the
fishing laws of the two States. The pres
ent trouble began by the Oregon men
crossing the river in a steamer and pulling
up piles, sending to sea the valuable
traps placed in Bakers Bay by the Wash
ington rishermen.
COLUMBIA FISHERMEN
Their Turbulent Attitude Brings
Out the Washington
Militia.
It Is Thought the Cannerymen Will
Finally Be Compelled to
Weaken.
ASTORIA, Or., April 9.â The fishing
season on the Columbia opens at Bid
night. There is every evidence that no
fish will be caught and dtlivered to the
cannerymen, at least to-morrow. Both
sides are still keeping a bold front, but the
all-day session of the cannerymen shows
weakness.
Under instruction from McGraw, Gov
ernor of Washington, a company of militia
is under arms on the Washington shore,
opposite here, to protect traps on and near
Sand Island. These traps are in the river
where Government engineers have de
clared it part of the channel of the river.
The rishermen laugh at the action of
Governor McGraw, while a company of
regulars are stationed at Fort Canby, a
few miles away. They say the Federal
authorities are more likely to prevent
traps from being used in their present
position.
No immediate trouble is anticipated.
DRILL OF CADETS.
Competition for the Montgomery Medal
Takes Placo To-.Vight iv the
Pavilion.
It is expected that the Mechanics' Pa
vilion will be crowded to-night at the
competitive drill of the various com
panies of the League of the Cross Cadets.
The drill is for the Montgomery medal â
a highly prized trophy among the cadet
corps of the Catholic temperance organi
zationâand great rivalry has existed for
some time past as to which company
would carry it off in triumph.
The occasion will be made one of grand
military display, as several prominent
army and militia officers have promised
to be present and to review the Ooys.
Among the invited guests are the officers
of th Boys' Brigade*
A very attractive and entertaining per
formance is promised.
TWO VERY LIVELY ROUNDS
Van Buskirk and Choynski Eox
at the Olympic Athletic
C:ub.
Joseph Went Right in for Business.
Only a Chosen Few Saw
the Bout.
Some of the members of the Olympic
Club were treated last evening to a very
interesting two-round bout between Joe
Choynski (California's favorite boxer) and
M. Van Buskirk. the champion heavy
weight boxer of the Olympic Club.
Manager Kennedy arranged the meet
ing between the two big 'uns after he had
promised Choynski that not more than a
dozen people should witness it.
It was about 9 r. m. when Van Bustirk
entered the room generally used by the
gun club annex. He was dressed in his
hest boxing clothes and looked every inch
a fi hter.
Eveiybody was anxious to see Chovn
ski, and when Joseph put in an appear
ance in ring costume those who had not
seen him before manifested surprise at his
build.
They expected to soe a whopping big fel
low, with legs like a Trojan and a back
similar to tnat of a prize bull. They were
sadly disappointed, however, as Choynski
carries rather slender nether limbs, but
from his hips up he is a magnificent speci
men of the athlete. He showed by a some
what haggard face that he has been exer
cising for some time "on the quiet," and
needs only light exercise to fit him for a
battle royal.
Eddie (iraney was referee and time
keeper. He Kayo the orders to get ready,
shake hands and proceed to business.
Van Buskirk was taken by surprise
when Choynski went right in for business.
There was no riddling or tomfoolery about
the set-to.
The men boxed two short rounds, which
can be summed up in very few words.
The Olympian made a very good stand
considering that he had a" master me
chanic before him, but Choynski, in the
language of the nnjrster, "put it all over
him," and rights and lefts landed on Van
Buskirk's nose and body in plenty.
Choynski has improved wonderfully
since his departure from this City, three
years ago.
He is now as quick as a flash, ana uses
both right and left alike. His foot work
is also uood, and there can be no gainsay
ing the fact that he carries heavy-weight
goods which sound rather loud when they
urop on any particular spot.
Van Buskirk, when compared with
Sharkey. is slow, of course, consequently j
it would be foolish for any person to draw
a line on what Chovr.ski can do with his
sext opponent by taking the bout of last
evening as a criterion.
MINING MEN IN SESSION
The New Appropriation Bill
Indorsed by the Executive
Committee.
CHANGES IN THE LANGUAGE.
Five Hundred Dollars Appropriated
to Maintain the Delegat on at
Washington.
The executive committee of the Califor
nia Mining Association met in special ses
sion at the Union League Club last night.
The meeting was called for the purpose of
taking action in relation to the mineral
land appropriation bill now before the
House of Representatives at Washington.
It was tinanimcusly decided to maintain
the delegation at Washington and $500
was voted for expenses.
Tirey L. Ford wired from Washington
the language of the proviso of the appro
priation bill, as follows:
For the construction of restraining: barriers
for the protection of the Smruniemo and
Feather rivers in California,: s2f><Â», ooo, such ru
btraining barriers to be const rut-ted under the
direction of the Secretary of War, in accord
ance with the recommendations of the "Cali
fornia Debris Commission," for the purpose
set forth in sections 23, 24 and 25 of the a<*t
entitled "An act to create the California Debris
Commission and regulate hydraulic mining in
tho State of California," approved March 1,
1803; provided the said suni shall be available
only on condition that the Legislature of the
State of California shall have appropriated at
least an equal sum for the purpose herein set
forth, to be expended in accordance with the
recommendations of eugiuecrs of the United
States (ioverument. Tirey L. Fop.d.
The following self-explanatory telegram
from Mr. Ford was also read :
Washington, D. C, April 8, 189 G.
Julian Sonntag, UV) California street, San Fran
cisco: California delegation to-day considered
onr appropriation, l'evtin's proposed amend
ment whs rejected. The delegation is afraid of
the proviso. At White's suggestion the follow
ing language was practically agreed upon by
the delegation:
"For the construction of restraining barriers
for the protection of the Hncramt-nto and
Feather rivers in California. $250,000, such re
straining barriers to be constructed under the
direction of the Secretary of Wi\r, in accord
ance with the recommendations of the Califor
nia L>ebris Commission."
Devlin seems inclined to accept the action of
the delegation, and my judgment is we should
do so. Tirey L.Fokd.
Mr. Ford also sent the following tele
gram to President Neff.
Upon mature deliberation am of the opinion
our position concerning the language of the
appropriation should depend on the legal con
struction of the proviso and the constitu
tionality of the State act. If the proviso is
deemed perfectly safe we should stand by our
guvs, otherwise accept White's suggestion.
Tirey L. Ford.
The following telegram was sent to Mr.
Ford last night:
San Francisco, Pal., AdHI 9, 1806.
P Hon. Tirey L. Ford. Hotel Xormandic, Wash
ington, D. C: I'pon request of Sonntug and
Thornton, we have carefully considered the
hydraulic appropriation clause recently passed
by the House and the substitute amendment
agreed upon by our delegation yesterday.
We are unanimously of opinion that the
National appropriation must be definite and
certain 10 bind State appropriation, and thar
the proviso would endanger both National and
State appropriations. We therefore indorse
the substitute amendment and to make the
same conform to the California act we recom
mend a further amendment striking out the
words "Sacramento and Feather" and insert
ing in lieu thereof the word "navigable. R. B.
Carpenter, J. J. De llaveu, John M. Wright.
President J. H. Neff also wired to Mr.
Ford, indorsing the telegram signed by
Carpenter, De Haven and Wright.
WILL UNIONIZE THE CITY
Building Trades Council to En
force the Working-Card
System.
Shop anl Job Stewards Will Be Se
lected as the First Step in
the Movement.
Since the strike on the Parrott building
; has been so saiisfact?rily settled the Af
\ filiated Buildmg Trades of this City has
; decided to proceed witn tne enforcement
lof the working card. The working card
! went into effect on April 1, but the atten
tion of the Building Trades Council being
occupied with the Market-street trouble,
the business agents and grievance com
mittee were unable to devote much atten
tion to the outside jobs. From now on
every effort will be made to unionize the
City and put the card into effective
operation.
It required two years in New York to
put the same system into operation, and
â  Kansas City required almost as long, but
i since it went into effect in several of the
large Eastern cities it has proved a de
; cided success. It is not expected that the
â  card will obtain complete recognition in
; San Francisco in a day or two, but every
effort will be made to carry out the system
and as speedily as oossible.
This was the principal subject of discus
sion at the meeting of the Building Trades
Council last evening. It was brought up
by several suggestions made by Business
i Agent Mclvor, after he and Agent Saun
ders had made their reports relative to the
settlement of the Parrott building strike,
which received tne approval of the coun
cil. His first suggestion was that shop
! stewards should be appointed in every
; shop and job stewards on every job in
| the City. The idea was favorably received
and the officers ofench affiliated union will
be requested to direct all union men to
select such stewards.
The latter's duty will be to examine the
working cards of all journeymen and
report all irregularities "or grievances to
the council or business agents. The method
of selection and other details will be on
the line of similar systems in vogue in the
East.
Another proposition decided upon was
to unionize the shops and not the jobs.
Tnis is to prevent a contractor from carry
ing on work in one place with a union
gang and running a non-union trang in
some other part of the City or in his shop.
This can be regulated when the shop
stewards understand their duties.
The secretary was directed to notify all
unions to see that all their members are
provided with the council's working card
to save annoyance and possibly to save
strikes.
On Tuesday evening, the 14th inst., a
mass-meeting of all the unions affiiated
with the Building Trades Council will be
held at 115 Turk stieet for the purpose of
electing two business agents or walking
delegates. Saunder9 and Me Ivor were ap
pointed by the council until the regular
election could be held. Only members in
good standing will be allowed to enter the
nail and vote.
Great preparations are being made for
the carpenters' picnic, which will be held
at Sunset Park on the 26th inst. The pic
nickers leave on the 8:45 a. m. boat and go
by the narrow-gauge route.
At the la^t meeting of the Hod-cnrriers'
Union James Gillispie, William O'Donnell
and Michael Dolan were selected as dele
gates to the Building Trades Council.
They were seated last night.
The branches of the Mississippi River
have an aggregate length of 15,000 miles.

CYCLE DEALERS UNITED
Want Smooth Pavements, Park
Lights and the New
Charter.
Twenty-Nine Dealers Start a Boird to
Coope-ate With the Mer
chants' Association.
The San Francisco Cycle Board of Trade
was organized last night in the Bicyclo
rama, on Market street. Twenty-nine of
the leading local bicycie-dealers "vere pres
ent at the adoption of a constitution and
by-laws, and signed as original members.
The objects of the new organization are
to help the trade and the cyclers generally,
primarily by obtaining better City pay. â¢
merits and incidentally by devising mean>
of advertising stolen wheels, recovering
them and apprehending the thieves, by
exposing fake advertising, and by co
operating with the League of American
Wheelmen in general wheeling matters
and with the Merchants' Association in
the effort to obtain smooth pavements fjr
tnis City.
The initiation fee was made $2, with
dues 50 cent* a month, in order that none
of t he smaller ilealera might be discour
aged from afliliating.
There are ninety-seven bicycle-dealers
in the City.
Meetings will be held once a month, and
a lar.e part of the business will be per
formed by a board of directors, consisting
ol tuirteen persons.
The preliminary committee on street i
improvement reported as a result of its re- \
cent investigations that it is not feasiule I
to agitate the paving of Market street jusc
at present, but that the attention of the
Cycle Board of Trade might well be turned
toward the lighting of the park.
J. S. Conwell, Thomas Mullen, J. M.
BrÂ»nnings,L. Devaney and James M. Ham
ilton discussed the report, and all agreed
that the nr?t feasible step would be to light !
the park, the paving of Market street !
being something that haying baffled the
efficient Merchants' Association should be
left to the new charter to make more easily I
attainable.
One idea offered fur liohting the park
was for all ihe bicycle-dealers, riders and
liverymen in the City to contribute their
pro rata share of the*sl2,ooo iv cessary for
the electric light plant. Brunnines him
self offered to start the dealers' subscrip
tion with $100.
After much discussion as to whether all
business should be done by the board as a
whole or by a board of directors, the con
stitution was adopted and signed by the
following, the election of officers being
postponed for a future meeting:
James Hamilton of Baker & Hamil

The British ship Blairraore capsized
yesterday morning in Mission Bay, half a

Works.
In view of the peculiar combination of
circumstances at the time, it is not aston
ishing that the five men and a boy who
were caged up in the vessel's hull were
drowned despice the prompt efforts of
John T. Scott and his men to release
them.
A light, cranky vessel, heavily sparred
aloft, against whose clumsy top-hamper
biew strong puffs of a southwest gale, and
a flood tide pushing in a contrary direction
furnished the conditions of yesterdays
fatal marine drama.
Wednesday night and Thursday morn
ing had been blustery and squally, with
rain, hail and wind. It was so much so
that Captain Caw of tie Blairmore found
it necessary to drop two anchors in addi
tion to the one already holding his ship's
noÂ«e shoreward. This was a precaution
ary measure that probably prevented the
disaster from occurring earlier, but which
later on assisted in bringing it about.
The ship lay east and west as the flood
tide began tilling the south arm cf the
bay, and she tugged at her anchor-chains
as though trying to tear away. The south
west wind, coming in occasional blasts,
swept through the rigeing and caught the
vessel broadside, toppling her over to star
board in a most threatening manner. She
â :v 260 tons of ballast aboard, and
Captain i';nv caused his men to lower all
her upper yards to the topgallant spars,
trusting that by lightening her in this
manner she would withstand the double
action of the water on her keel and the
wind aloft.
His judgment, however, was defective.
The old ship ill a i might have easily
fougnt lier w; t y out of the weather if
turned loose with Etqu&red sails, succumbed
to the inevitable when hampered with
chains. She was actually tipped :ver jii9t
as a Lofty pine tree is grounded by the
woodsman who attaches ropes to its top
ami pulls while another uses the ax at its
trunk.
The Blairmore could not stand the pres
sure. She was thoroughly unprepared for
it with her light load of ballast.
It was evident to the saiiors aboard that
the vessel was in great danger, and shortly
after H o'clock, whan the wind was at its
.height and the men were ordered out to
wash decks on all vessels in that part of
the bay, every skipper saw that there was
strong likelihood of a catastrophe.
Captain Caw alone appeared to be ob
livious to the danger that was threaten
enirif;. He ordered his men between decks
and into the bilge to scrape and clean the
insides.
Captain Marshall with the tug Active
was within a few hundred feet of the
Blairmore shortly before she careened.
He was towing a vessel down the bay the
time, but, seeing the danger in which the
anchored ship was, he dropped his hawser
and put off to the rescue.
His object was to make fast to the
B'airmore on the weather side and help
her riirht herself. He could have done
even more by turning her nose into the
wind, but Captain Caw refused the
proffered assistance believing his old ship
would weather the gale.
Captain Brokaw of the tug Alert was
less than a quarter of a mile away. He
j realized ttie Blairmore's predica
ment, and following the action of the
Active he steamed toward the ship.
1! c had not pone far before the starboard
cross-jack, main and fore yard arms were
dipping into the waters of the bay, the
lower and upper topsail yards following
soon after. When the action of the flood
tide came to bear on these spars, there was
no power on earth to prevent the capsizing,
and Captain Caw, too late, saw the disas
ter thai must follow.
He and .T. L. Watson were on deck near
thÂ° after hatch in front of the cabin, and
as with one voice, they yelled to their
shipmates to hurry from below, that the
s h i I > was going over.
There were ten men in the hold busily
â¢'1 in trying to keep their balance
and still worn. That some of them at
leuM knew or felt they were in great
danger is evinced by the fact that in the
few moments, seconds in fact, which it
took the vessel to make her last turn five
of them managed to climr> up the hatch
way and force their way out against the
rush of water pouring in.
i -r.-t Mate Thomas Ludgate was with
w in the hold and with the others
he made a gallant light for his life. He
mong the foremost to reach the main
bat as he grasped for the coamings
: â¢ apstan bar, picked up by the rush
waters. was swept into the hatch,
striking him a cruel blow and knocking
him back into the abyss.
irst mate and Steward Samuel
Kenny were the only two men who are
kn vii to he drowned that were seen by
those who were saved.
Kenny was in the galley where thestar
boara door was wide open. When the
ship careened the water rushed in, filling
the place before Kenny could unhook the
port door and tnnkÂ« his escape. Although
above decks Kenny's fate was no better
than that of those who remained below.
All this occurred in but a very short
space of time, daring which incidents
crowded in upon the participants at a rate
that can hardly be estimated. Captain
Caw was perched high up on the weather
rail hanging on to an iron belaying-pin
with one hand and to his shepherd aog
with the other.
Second Mate D. McDonald, Third Mate
William Melville, Carpenter J. L. Watson,
and Apprentices J. B. Pope, A. Powell,
Henry Bell and Stewart Marwick had been
caught by the waves and were badly
bruised and battered against the shrouds,
where they clung in despair and whence
they were afterward picked up by the
small boats from the surrounding ships.
It should be stated that the officers in
charge of the vessels around the Blair
more distinguished themseives by the
prompt and admirable work they did. No
sooner did the ship capsize than half a
dozen boats were lowered from their dav
its and manned for action. It is due to
this alertness more than to anything else
that so many lives were saved. The vessels
that did this effective work were the Ital
ian ship Caterina Accame, the British
ships Kllisland, Alexandria and British

Yeoman, and the American brig John D.
Spreckels.
Far away, over at the Union Iron Works
wharf, lay the tug Rockaway. Superin
tendents John Scott and Dickie were
aboard of her watching the threatened
catastrophe through marine glasses.
When it occurred they were not slow in
acting. They went out to the rescue
at once.
The masts and spars had all disappeared
and the port side of her lazily swung in
the swash of the bay. There was a vast
expanse exposed, however, perhaps 200
feet by 15 in surface, but hardly over three
feet out of water. All entrances to the
ship were under water, and the air still
inside the hull kept the vessel afloat.
If the unfortunate five men within man
aged to escape the sidings and the ballast
which must have tumbled dangerously
about them during the roll-over, there was
one chance for their being still alive, float
ing in the hull at the air level in the
bilge.
The Union Iron Works men say that
when they reached the vessel they could
hear those within yelling and pounding
on the vessel's bottom.
Superintendents Scott and Dickie and
their workmen boarded the upturned hull,
and immediately proceeded to cut a hole
through the vessel s Bteel plates. They
trusted that they could save the men be
fore the air rushing out would cause her to
sink completely.
The eighteen-inch hole was partly
chiseled through, and with a strong blow
with a sledge the plate was smashed in.
T he compressed air within burst out, and
as the tremendous weight of the hull
pressed downward the water gushed out in
a perfect geyser to the height of twenty
odd feet. The workmen hardly had time
to cet off the winking hull to the tug, leav
ing their tools behind.
A moment later all of the British ship
Blairmore was hidden below the surface of
the bay.
The ship lay in over seven fathoms of
water, and it was not until late in tne
afternoon, at low tide, that her side, ap
pearing like a huge whale asleep on the
bay's surface, peeped out as a resting place
for the seagulls. These scavengers of the

The British ship Blairmore of Glasgow,
belonging to Thompson & Dickie, is of the
same line as tbe Edenballymore, at pres
ent lying at Sausahto, and the Craigmore,
now on her way here from New South
Wales. She was a steel vessel, 264 feet in
length, 39 feet of beam and 23 feet of hold.
She was of nearly 1800 tonnage.
She arrived here early in February with
a cargo of coal, and owing to the low char
ters to be obtained at the present time she
was lying in Mission Bay, in ballast and
being cleaned.
Excepting the case of the Earl of Dal
housie, when two sailors were drowned
about eight years ago in this bay, no other
capsizing of a sailing vessel has occurred in
these waters.
Commendable and prompt action on the
part of the Federal Government is cvi

PIERCING THE HULL.
A Heroic Effort on the Part of the
Union Iron Works Employes
to Rescue the Sailors.
Superintendents John T. Scott and James
A. Dickie of the Union Iron WorKs went
out to the wrect in the yard tugÃockaway
at 8:15 in the morning, about an hour and
a quarter after the vessel went over. They
were accompanied by several workmen
with their tools, and their puroose was to
make an effort to rencue the six men im
prisoned in the iron hull.
"When we reached the Blairmore," said
Mr. Bcott yesterday afternoon, "all the
other tugs and boats were gone and the
side, or bilge, of the ship showed abjut
three feet above the surface of the bay. It
was a melancholy sight, that great yellow
metal coffin of six human beings. Our ob
ject was to attempt their rescue, if they
were alive, by piercing the hull. We were
well aware that this was a foriorn hope, as
a hole drilled tkrough an iron plate would,
if she were not aground, instantly liberate
the imprisoned air and send her to the
bottom. But we could see that the air was
escaping, because fountains of water were
spurting up like big geysers from the sub
merged cabin windows and ventilators.
And to hurry ub in our work, the tide was
rising fast.
"First we wished to ascertain if the hull
was really aground and for that purpose
took soundings. The lead line marked
six and one-half fathoms or thirty-nine
feet and we calculated that a ship her ton
nage would have a beam of about forty
two feet. This would let her rest on the
bottom of the bay with three feet above
water.
"So we considered it safe to open the '
hull and went to work with our tools. We
chalked out an eighteen-inch square in one
of the plates, cutting almost through the
three-fourths of an inch thickness of plate.
When we began to hammer at the hull we
heard the groans and shouts of the men
inside and these spurred us on to hasten
their deliverance. The air kept gushing â 
out of the ventilators making the water I
boil around them and the rising tide was j
closine in upon us. I tell you we worked i
with a will, for it was a race between our
chisels and the threatening water. We
kept the tug close alongside ready to drop
our tools and spring aboard if the hull
suddenly dropped farther down.
"All the time we could hear tne noise of
the men inside imprisoned in the com
pressed and foul air. We cut through the
iron clear around the square to a thin skin
just barely enough to hold the almost de
tached piece of plate in its place.
"Then came the critical moment, and
we prepared to break the piece in with our
heavy sledge-hammers. The tide was be
ginning to lap over the plate which we had
pierced, and in a short time it, too, would
be beneath the water.
"Then we struck together. Two good,
sure blows and the piece fell inâ and my
God, I shall never forget what then took
place.
"The air seemed to heave itself out of
the vessel in a solid body, and the hull
dropped, I might say, right from under
us. The water rushing in through the
gaping hole would meet the ascending
force from below and be driven upward
fully ten feet with a tremendous roar.
"As the hull went lower the upward
rush of air and water ceased. Even the
ventilators stopped their gushing, and so
the waters of the bay rolled over the
sunken Blairmore.
"With all of the buoyant air out of her
the dead weight of the great iron hull set
tled three or four feet further in the mud
before we could get at the men. We knew
we were near some of them and if the ves
sel had been resting on anything like a
hard bottom, as we had hoped she was,
we could have rescued them if they were
then alive. We fully understood that we
only had a bare chance of success in our
humane endeavors, and we worked with
all the skill and dispatch possible. We
knew from the gushing of the water over
the open places in the submerged part of
the hull that the imprisoned air was es
caping fast, and that with the rising tide,
which would rill the vessel when the huli
was free of the air, would end all life
within the Rreat iron tank. We did our
best to save the poor fellows and we were
grieved when the effort failed. But it is ':
too sad a thing to talk further about . and
1 don't think I can say any more. I would
have given anything to hava.been able to
lift those men out of that sinking hull, but
we could not." . .

THE DEATH-TRAP.
Stories of the Apprentice Boys Who
Were at Work Down In the
Lower Hold.
Stewart, Marwick, an intelligent 19-year
old apprentice boy, was down in the lower
hold chipping the iron-rust from the ves
sel's side. He was standing on a sort of
staging rigged over the dirt ballast that
lay on the bottom of the hull. Above him
was the between-deck, which is merely a
sort of balcony around a long and wide
open hatch. On this between deck was
piled a lot of barrels of beef and a mass of
heavy planking used In stowing cargo.
When the vessel went over on her beam
onds these barrels and planks fell into the
hold among the men straggling to escape.
Second Mate McDonald had his foot
crushed and Apprentice Siegle was struck
down by the flying timbers, and it is pos
sible that some of the unfortunate men
were more or less injured, possibly killed,
in this manner.
"The ship was rolling to starboard all
morning," said Marwick in an interview,
"and as I knew she had been behaving in
a cranky way I was a little nervous. Pres
ently aho listed so fdr over that 1 jumped
from the staging and was making for the
ladder, but she came back and I thought
she was all right, and I went back to my
work.
"But she began to go again and the stuff
between-decks began to slide to leeward.
Farther and fartner she went slowly but
surely over till the deck was almost up and
down. The beef barrels and lumber came
flying down through the open hatch into
the hold, and the dirt and rock ballast be
gan to pour a perfect avalanche to the
lower side. Several of U3 made a break
for the ladder for we knew the ship was
gone. This ladder was not fastened, but
stood on the ballast reaching up to the
between-decks hatch. It was knocked
down and our chances of getting out of
the hold by that means was cut off.
"I heard the second mate cry out when
a plank or something struck him, and Ap
prentice Siegle was struck on the bead.
The whole thing passed so quickly that I
can't remember all that took place. I
Know we were all trying to escape; and it
was every man for himself. The rolling,
pitching and bumping of the barrels,
boards and ballast on the one side of the
ship made a horrible din, and that, with
the knowledge that we would probably be
drowned like caged rats made us franticâ
at least it did me.
>"Then the water began to pour a great
flood through the open hatches, filling the
hull. I found myself clinging to a beam
with a death-like grip and somehow I
managed to get out in the open air and on
to the upper rail clear of the water. The
second mate was helped up near me, where
he clung groaning with his wounded foot.
At Low Water the Seagulls Made a Roosting- Place Out of the Submerged Vessel's Keel, and Even the
Tugs That Carried the Curious to the Wreck Could Not Scare Them Away.
Men Were Sent from the Union Iron Works to Cut a Hole in the Bottom of the Submerged Ship. When
They Had Accomplished This the Confined Air Threw Up a Stream of Water and the Ship Went Down.
The ship sunk till only a part of her side
was above the water and we thought she
would go down under us. We saw a num
ber of boats from other ships making for
us as fast as they could come and we were
taken off by the Cromdale's gig.
"So our ship and six mates and every
thing we own is under the bay. We ap
prentice boys will probably be sent to the
Edenballymore, now at Sausalito, as she
belongs to the same firm as did the Blair
more. The Craigmore, another ol our
ships, is on her way to this port. Maybe
we will get in her."
Apprentice James Pope was also caught
in the lower hold, and although struck
with a heavy piece of flying timber, suc
ceeded in escaping from the deathtrap.
He was thrown down to leeward with the
falling ballast and almost buriea in the
rocks and dirt, but miraculously made his
way up through the hatch.
'â¢All the after part ol the night the ship
had been rolling over to the strong gusts
of wind, because she was so empty and the
ballast wouldn't hold her steady. Once,
about 2 o'clock in the morning, we jumped
out of our bunks when she careened so far,
thinking that her time had come, but she
righted herself slowly. When she was
empty she was as cranky as a dying top,
because she was so heavily sparred. While
I was at work in the hold I didn't like the
way she rolled â a sort of death wallow ;
but I chipped away at the iron rust and
watched her list.
"I can't tell how I escaped from the
awful uproar ana confusion of that hold.
I did not hear anybody speak or cry out.
We just hurried for the ladder, which fell
down upon us. We had no time nor
breath for words. I believe some of the
men were injured, if not killed, by being
struck with the flying stuff in the hold."
Hamilton Bell, another apprentice, had
been working below, but just before the
ship went over was called up on deck by
the carpenter. He had just stepped on
deck and was almost thrown back in the
lower hold by the careening of the vessel.
Had he fallen there would have been one
more unfortunate.
He made his way out of the lee scup
pers, into which he had been thrown, and
found a safe perch on the upper rail.
"I saw the captain hanging on to one of
the boats," said he, "with one hand and
on to his dog with the other. He became
exhausted, and I believe the dog did much
to hold his master up. The water swept
everything not lashed off the upper deck,
even the chickens in their coops. The
cook, Samuel Kenny, was in the cabin and
he was lost. Poor Roland Siegle's time
was almost expired and he was going
home soon to pass his examination for an
officer's berth.
"Last night as we were coming aboard
he looked up at the ship and jokingly
said 'I wish the old hooker would turn
over.' That was a fatal wish indeed, and
was granted with sad results. Siegle was
18 years old, and came from West Nor
wood, near Dulwich, London. He was
the only apprentice-boy lost out of the six
we had.
"When the ship began to dip far down,
Carpenter Watson called down the bold
for all hands to save themselves. The
water was pouring over the lee hatch
combing and I doubt if any heard him.
"I understand that the first mate in the
hold with the men was knocked down by
a heavy piece of timber and disabled. He
grabbed a line, but the water running over
the hatch washed him further down in the
hold."
Third Officer Melville was in the hold
and escaped when the ship went over by
clinging to a ladder. He says that the in
coming water drove the unfortunate men
back from the hatches and drowned them
like rats in a trap. There was no chance
to help each other, and it was every man
for himself.
Captain John Caw was on deck when his
ship took her fatal roll, and as she settled
in the bay clung to a boat. He held on to
his dog and did not let the animal go until
it was safely deposited in the Cromdale's
gig. When seen after the disaster he was
so affected by the loss of his ship and men
that he could hardly speak.
"It was so quickly done," said he, "that
1 can't explain how it happened. The
tide was bearing us one way and the strong
puffs of wind blowing us the other, and
over we went. My poor ship bowed her
self down, and she's gone. But my poor
men â that's tne worst of all. I can't talk
about it."
Captain White of the ship British Yeo
man seated that one of his men saw the
Blairmore going over.
"I ordered a boat called away," he said,
"and pulled away for the sinking ship.
We took several men off her rails, and she
soon disappeared under the bay. I never
saw anything so quickly done in my life.
The Cromdale's fast gig wa3 the first to
reach the wreck and take off some of the
crew."
Captain Marshall in the tug Active was
towing the ship Alexandra near the Blair
more when she went over. He immedi
ately cast off and hurried to the founder
ing vessel. He tried to get a line to the
ship, hoping to hold her up, but she was

Captain Barfield of the Alexandra sent his
boats and crew to the rescue.
The tug Alert was soon at the scene and
tried to render assistance. Captain
Brokaw says that the air escaping from
the 31airmore's hold threw streams of
water fifteen feet high. It was impossible
to do anything to save the vessel, and al
though the bay was full of tugs, they wera
powerless.
Samuel Kenny, the cook and steward,
was a native of New York, aged about 35
years. He shipped aboard of the ship in
this port March 11.
First Mate Ludgate was 30 years old, a
native of England and unmarried.
Seaman Henry Clark was a, Scotchman
and about 30 years old.
Apprentice Roland Emil Siegle was a
native of London, aged 18.
Seaman G. Rennebaum was a native of
Germany and about 33 years of age.
H. Synstrand, the watchman, was born
in the Island of Mauritius about 45 years
ago.
At low tide in the evening a portion of
the yellow hull could be seen above the
water, with the waves breaking over it.
Captain Caw reported big loss to the Brit

mediately to recover the bodies by divers.
It is estimated that the expense of raising

OALirOENIA TOR SILVER.
The action of the Republican State Con
vention in Utah in rirruly taking an ad
vanced stand on behaif of the silver inter
ests of the West Mill no doubt awaken a
responsive movement throughout the Pa
cific Coast. Certainly California will re
spond to it and will give all the aid of her
influence and her power in assisting her
sister States to defend an interest common
to them all. Of that much there can be no
question. It will, in fact, be a strange de
velopment in our politics if the whole of
the Greater "West does not stand as a
united force to maintain the cause of silver
whenever and wherever it may be assailed.
It is well that California should speak
out clearly and forcibly at this time, for in
some quarters an attempt has been made
to represent the people of this State as
being lukewarm in the contest. Because
this is the iand of gold, because we have no
large silver mines within our borders, it has
been supposed that seif-interest would im
pel us to take sides with the monometal
list? and support the single gold standard,
careless of what might be ihe consequence
to the silver-mining States. This supposi
tion must be refuted. The people of Cali
fornia are in favor of free coinage of silver.
The gold-miners themselves are in favor
of it. There is no interest in this State op
posed to the interests of our aister States.
Every intelligent man who has had any
long experience in California knows how
closely the welfare of our people is allied
to that of the people of all the mining
States and Territories. When silver-min
ing nourished San Francisco nourished.
California flourished. Our merchants, our
farmers, our manufacturers did a business
with the silver-mining towns and camps
that yielded a profit to all forms of our in
dustry. Some of the Btati st buildings
in this City wereerected by * eatth brought
from silver mines, and from the same
source came the money that ha 3 estab
lished many a fine farm, a fruitful orchard
or a comfortable home in the valleys and
towns of the interior.
There cannot be a great and prosperous
city without a great and prosperous coun
try to sustain it. To make San Francisco
all that it should be we must build up not
only California but the Greater West. A
new impulse will be felt reviving all the
energies of California as soon as the silver
mines are reopened in Nevada, Arizona
and New Mexico. Our gold mines will not
be injured by this competition. On the
contrary they will to some extent be bene
iited, for the work in the silver mines
will cause such an additional demand for
mining machinery that it wiil be made in
larger quantities and consequently at a
cheaper proportional cost.
Our experience of what Has happened in
San Francisco and in California generally
s-ince the shutting down of the silver
mines is all the proof that intelligent men
can require of the benefits we derived from
those mines when they were in profitable
operation. In common with the rest of
the world we have suffered from the fall
in prices, the depression in trade, the
weakening of industry and the difficulty
of debt-paying caused by the demonetiza
tion of silver, but our loss has been greater
than that of other regions, for in addition
to these indirect consequences we have
suffered a direct injury in the loss of the
output of the mines themselves. It is to
our interest, in short, to have all the mines
of the Great West profitably working.
This i.* indeed the gold-producing State,
but it is a part of a great silver-producing
region to whose interests it is inseparably
bound by every tie of business and in
dustry.
PAYING PEOBLEMS.
The familiar fact that one improvement
leads to others is illustrated in the case of
the Corbett road and Market street. The
work of widening and macadamizing the
former picturesque highway was no sooner
put under way than the bicycle-dealers
organized ana are now moving earnestly
for a better pavement in Market street. Ex-
Mayor Pond has pointed out a serious
difficulty which he encountered when he
tried to secure a good pavement for that
street. The City offered to bear hail tbe
expense if the property-owners would as
sume the re-it. He made a canvass and
secured the assent of three-fourths of the
property frontage, but because a fourth
held out tue improvement could not be
made.
A similar difficulty may be expected in
all such undertakings. Not nntil there is
a general spirit of progress, such as has
made Chicago one of the wonders of the
age, will tbere be that intelligent co
operation from which good results come.
The people of San Francisco have as good
pavements as they deserve. The City can
occupy no higher a commercial position
than its inhabitants create tnrough an
understanding of tbe benefits resulting
from enterprise. The great question is to I
devise some scheme which shall measur- {
ably compensate for the indifference of
the people.
A law to meet such a difficulty as that
encountered by Mr. Pond is dearly needed.
It could compel the backward to do their
share where they are in a reasonably small
minority. Under the present system one
fourth of the property-owners on Market
street can prevent not only their own proD
erty but also that of the majority from
enhancing greatly in value as the result
of a good pavement. The rule of the ma
jority prevails in this country, and might
well be enforced in such a case as this.
The right of a few unprogressive citizens
to block the whole City should not be rec
ognized.
As the Ftreet has been accepted, it can
not be repaved under the present law ex
cept by tiie City or the voluntary con
tributions of the fronting property-owners.
The City has the power under certain con
tingencies to assist private owners who
want to asust themselves. If they do not
choose to do this the whole City must suf
fer. A law might be passed requiring the
backward minority to do their share. That
is one tiling to bj considered.
Another is the issuance of municipal
bonds. This can be done for special or
general purposes. Market street is con
spicuously the thoroughfare of all the peo
ple. Any beneik to it is a benefit to every
property-owDer in town. Its disgraceful
condition under these circumstances is the
most eloquent evidence that the people
need regeneration before they can expect
San Francisco to occupy the position to
which its superb natural advantages en
title it.
TELLER'S BANK BILL.
Senator Teller of Colorado has thrown a
bomDshell into the national bank system
of the country by introducing a bill requir
ing such banks to keep their reserve at
home instead of sending it to New York
and other reserve centers, there to be lent
to stock speculators. New York is the
great-beneficiary of the plan now in voÂ»ue,
as Mr. Teller asserts that in September
last the banks of that c-ity held $200,000,000
of reserve required to be kept by outlying
national banks. Of course a small interest
is paid by the New York banks for the
money.
Mr. Teller's idea is that the country
banks' should be required to keep at least
a large proportion of their reserves at
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 10, 1896.
home, so as to prevent the accumu
lation of money in the reserve cities. The
suggestion is interesting. These banks aie
scattered all over the country, and by
reason of the special grace which they en
joy at the hands of the Government are in
a sense a pioper engine of the Government
for promoting the development of the na
tion. New York's domination in fkian-
cial matters has always been felt as a bur
den, and Wall street is a byword from
ocean to ocean. That the stock manipu
lators there enjoy the extraordinary ad
vantage of being able to use the national
bank reserve from all parts of the country
is a surprising condition of thing 9 and ex
plains much of the hardship suffered by
the people at large.
A large proportion of the internal devel
opment of the United States comes from
European capital. The investment means
a steady drain on the country in the shape
of interest and dividends. The national
bank money kept on deposit in New York
of course cannot be placed in permanent
improvements and hence is withdrawn
from the possioility of use in that way. So
long as the profits of manufacture and
production in the United States were
large the drain to Europe was not seri
ously felt, but now that margins have been
reduced it has become a burden. A free
trade tariff has aided materinlly in bring
ing about that condition of affairs, but
under any circumstances the unwisdom
of depending on Europe for developing
capital and using our own money for
speculation is evident.
The national banks would probably find
some good use at home for their reserve.
The laws governing them may require
considerable modification in order that the
banks may not be unjustly restrained of
their liberty, but that need not be a diffi
cult task. The greatest need of this coun
try is an intelligent use of its own capital,
to the end that we may become measur
ably free lrom the domination of Euro
pean financial interest, now so clearly ap
parent as a force affecting our financial
policy. Mr. Teller's bill will liKely create
a sensation, and good may come from at
least a full discussion of the subject.
THE LOS ANGELES CONTEST.
A calm anaiysis of the two meetings
held at Los Angeles Wednesday evening,
one favoring an appropriation for San
Pedro harbor to the exclusion of Santa
Monica, and the other declaring for ap
propriations for both harbors, will show
the following facts: First, that the im
provement of Santa Monica would be the
creation of a monopoly for the Southern
Pacific in the absence of the improvement
of San Pedro also; second, that the im
provement of San Pedro would permit of
competition without relerence to any im
provement of Santa Monica; third, that
there can be no possible hope that Con
gress for a long time to come can be in
duced to make both appropriations, for the
reason that it would be an unfair distribu
tion of public funds in view of the numer
ous purposes for which appropriations are
needed in California.
It is charged that the meeting held in
j favor of both appropriations was
I "drummed up" by the Southern Pacific
j Company in order to show a difference of
I opinion at Los Angeles and thus assist the
1 movement for the defeat of the San Pedro
, proposition. This is a serious charge, as
, thousands of persons attended the meet
\ ing, among them being many of the high
jest patriotism. It is admitted, however,
that many of those in attendance came
from Sauta Mouica and other places con
tiguous to the harbor. Their animus is
, evident, and h&jice their action cannot be
'. hoped to carry great weight. No one will
: deny that the effect of the so-called oppo
â  s'.tion meeting, whatever may have been
I its intention, will be to obstruct the im
j provement of San Pedro and to forward
| the purposes of the Southern Pacific.
Through all this wretched and darnaÂ£r
ing confusion one proposition is clearly
| discernible. It is that the desire of
j neither of the meetings should be given
, undue consideration. Neither of these
! harbors exists for the people of Los Angeles
I alone. The principles involved reach in
finitely beyond their local interests.
Southern California has progressed won
derfully in recent years, and back of it
lies a splendid empire east of tne Colorado
River that is rapidly developing and that
, needs a harbor in Southern California.
Still beyond all this lies the consideration
that the whole of the rich territory stretch
ing from Los Angeles to New Orleans and
J from the Rio Grande to Salt Lake needs
such a harbor and would be greatly bene
lited by it.
If the Southern Pacific Company should
succeed in creating such a division among
the people of that city that they cannot
work unitedly for a free harbor, Los An
geles will have committed its first mis
take in the glowing history which it has
j written. It will tie its hands against
I the possibility of receiving the one thing
needed to complete its greatness. Here
tofore that city has been the exemplar of
California, and it should remain true to
its record in this crisis.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
A white-haired and white-bearded man,
arrayed in a light-colored suit of clothes, and
with an Indian hat on his head, arrived at the
Occidental yesterday from far over the seas,
after an absence of no less than forty-eight
years. It was plain to see that he had come
from some mild clime, probably half around
the glnbe. Among the scores of persons in the
hotel office he attracted attention.
The visitor was James Henley of Victoria, j
Australia, and He has a strange history. So ;
queer is it to him that he has come back to try j
and get his bearings agaiu. He used to wort i
in the California gold mines, and he wants to '
brenthe the same refreshing air once more.
When a youth, he came from England to
Pennsylvania with his father's family. They
settled near Pittsburjr. He remained there
eight years, till 1848, till he caught the gold I

fever and came on to Oregon. He stayed there
a short time and thtn came to California.
"I mined on the Yubaâ the south fork of the
Yuba," said the gentleman, "ana stuck to it
for one summer. It was a pleasant place to try
for cola, and I did well, getting a good deal
of it.
"I was pretty well contented till I heard of
excitement over in Victoria, Australia. It was
another gold furor, and as speedily as I could
I got what few things I bad together and went
over there. I didn't know whether I would
ever get back or not, or what would become of
me.
"But I did well there, too, and eventually I
got into other things. I engaged in the sheep
and hop business, and succeeded pretty well.
I also kept mining a little. I nave flourished
so well that I am satisfied.
"Prices for all kinds of products have been
rather low in Australia, but they are better
now. I notice hops are worth only from. 5 to
7 cents here, which, it appears to me, isn't
half the cost of raising them. We pay 7 cents
lor picking alone. We employ Chinese and
European labor.
"Politically and industrially Australia is
flourishing pretty well. We are through with
booms, at least so we hope, as we are thor
oughly convinced they are damaging to the
country. The Coolgurdie mines are 2000 miles
away irom where I live, so there is not a very
great interest in them.
"We raise a great many sheep in my part of
Australia. The wool is now worth from 7
pence to a shilling a pound, or, in the money
of the United States, from 1-4 to 24 cents.
' 'Now tu&T I am back in California, after an
absence of so long a time. I shall see all I can
of it, renew my youth and enjoy myself as
much as possible."

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
SAN PEDRO HARBOR.
A Master Mariner Has Something to Say
About the Santa Monica Scheme.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
I have read with much interest the accounts
in your paper of the proposed harbor of
refuge for the port of Los Angeles. As a
mariner having for twenty years navigated
the North Pacific coastwise, I hope a few prac
tical points may be of some benefit to the public.
If we are going to have a harbor of refuge let
us have it and not one like our life-saving sta
tions on the Pacific Coast. In fine weather a
ship in distress can help herself, but in bad
weather when in need of assistance she is out
siae of the line of breakers and lifeboats are ,
insid9 on shore where they must wait till the
weather and sea abate before they can go to
her assistance; only a practical man knows
the impossibility of launching such a boat
through the breakers even under ordinary
circumstances.
A harbor of refuge should be in a place where
it could be easily approachable by a sailing
vessel or any vessel in distress. It should be
in a place where a ship could have a chance to
recover herseli and get 10 sea if she should fail
to make her port by reason of thick fogs and
baffling winds and calm. It should lie in a
place where a ship would not run a greater
risk iv approaching it than she is really in.
It seems to me that San Pedro is already, by
nature, partially a harbor of refuge, the dt-pth
of water, nature of the bottom aud reef pro
jecriMT from Point Iflrmln betr>Â« important
factors In its favor, Otalina nnd San
Clemente islands lie In such a position that
while they do not directly shelter San Pedro
they partially break up the heavy westerly
swell before it reaches San Pedro Harbor.
As for Santa Monica Bay or any other bay
with bottom an>l beach of a qur ksand nature,
it seems to me they are out of the question as
a harbor of refuse. In the tirst place, it is too
close in shore for a vessel to approach ; besides,
a breakwater run out in any 'direction would
simply form a peninsula in" time, as no tide
runs in any striUKhi direction with any force,
and the prevailing currents caused "by the
coast winds would bank up the sand on both
sides and fill up the harbor. When there is
quicksand facing the srround swell of the
ocean and no ebb and flow of the tide Irom
any straight direction to keep the harbor open
and in place no one coukl tell what turn the
sands would take and what the result would
be. In my opinion, in a short time the harbor
and the breakwater would close up and form
into one peninsula. C. F. Swan,
Master of bark Theobald.

THE FASHIONABLE SLEEVES.
Our group showi a tight sleeve with draped
puffs and a U-g-o'-mutton tight and wrinkled
below the elbow.
Smaller sleeves are no longer a mere rumor;
they have materialized in some of the spring
gowns, and though they are stylish, pretty and
becoming, they will not completely rout the
larger shapes till the fall, for the full sleeve is
too comfortable for summer wear to be dis
carded at this season. But the woman who
wishes to keep abreast, or ahead, rather, of the
fashions will have at least one pair In her best
gown, probably.
The close-ntted sleeve, with full but short
draped puff, is the finest model. It Is made of
one or two fabrics. One seen was of green and
blue Dresden silk, with the puff of blue canvas
cloth matching the waist and skirt Â«
Another was entirely of the silk of which the
gown was make. .
sleeves with a close lining over which the
fabric is wrinkled below the elbow are a favor

Francisco.
REFORMS DEMANDED.
Views Expressed by a Commit
tee of the Chamber of
Commerce.
PILOTS AND LAW - MAKERS.
Assertion That a Corruption Fund Is
Available to Influence Legis
lation.
The commerce committee of the Cham
ber of Commerce held an important ses
sion yesterday afternoon, with Hugh
Craig presiding.
The sub-committee on harbor property
and harbor changes submitted a report.
The report discusses at considerable length
the subject of completing the seawall, and
in this connection says:
It is conceded by all alike that the wall
oueht to be completed at once from Market
street south to Channel. What makes the ne
cessity more pressing is the fact that until the
seawall be completed the City will not improve
the streets adjoining the docks and the Har
bor Commission has no jurisdiction over them :
that the streets along the water front from
Market street south are in a disgraceful condi
tion.
The report estimates that the cost of
completing the wall will amount t051,000.
--000. Four sources are mentioned from
which the money might be obtained:
Firstâ From the revenue of the Harbor Com
mission.
Secondâ From the Federal Government.
Thirdâ From the general fund of the State.
Fourthâ From the City of San Francisco.
In regard to the general administration
of water-front affairs ti.e sub-committee
presents the following:
In the administration of the harbor prop
erty your committee sees room for very great
improvement. The Harbor Commission hns
long been regarded as "spoils" for the party in
power, and in the administration of the water
front the doctrine of "To the victor belongs the
spoils" has been carried out to its fullest ex
tent. Unfortunately, in this case, the "spoils"
come directly out of the commerce of San
Francisco, which is compelled to pay the bills.
The extent to which the "spoils" system has
been carried on the water front is a matter of
grave concern to the public. Xoionly have all
official positions, from that of the Harbor Com
missioner down to the wharf-sweepers, been
eiven out as a reward for party fealty, but
supplies have been purchased and minor con
tracts have been awarded, not upon a business
basis, but because the seller or contractor be
longed to the proper political party and had
influence in the party councils.
It is needless to point out that such a system
is wasteful, extravagant, inefficient snd wholly
unsatisfactory and that it ought to be changed.
Your Eub-comrnittee therefore recommends
that this body appoint some competent person
to draft a bill to provide for the administra
tion of tho water-front property under civil
service rules, upon a business basis and re
gardless of cartisun considerations, and that
when drafted the bill be presented to the next
State Legislature for enactment into law.
In this connection your sub-committee takes
X'leHsure in saying that it believes the present
Harbor Commission is heartily in accord with
your sub-committee in the movement to take
the administration of the Harbor Commission
out of politics and place it upon a business
basis. The present commission has already
effected some reforms in this direction and
betrays a disposition to effect more were it
enabled to do so under the law. Your sub
committee has good reason to believe that a
measure for administrative reform could be
drafted which would meet with the hearty
approval of the Hurbor Commission and of
the Governor of the State. Respectfully sub
mitted, Frank Dalton,
William L. Merry,
Hugo 1). Kiel,
Jsadore Jacobs,
A. 1. EsBERU.
In discussing the recommendation of
the report, Isadore Jacobs asserted that it
would be better for the committee to go
before the party conventions and get in
sorted in the platform of each party a
j declaration in favor of the. reforms de
sired. He believed that very little if any
eood would be accomplished by drafting a
bill and presenting it to the Legislature.
"The pilots," he said, "would probably
I oppose the bill. I understand they have a
! large corruption fund to use in the Legis
! lature."
The report was sent back to the sub
committee for such action as the commit
tee should deem proper in drawing a bill.
The secretary reported that a letter had
been received from Congressman Loud in
which the latter stated that he was work
ing to get an appropriation for a log
signal ship on the bar to take the place of
the whistle.
Professor Davidson said an appropria
tion of $5000 would probably be allowed
for the purpose of removing three rocks dis
covered in the bay. A rock near the
Potrero wharf with only a depth of 17 feet
of water over it was made kno,wn by Cap
tain Gray and his tug man to Lieutenant
Bears of the Coast Survey steamer McAr
thur. There were also two rocks in front
of the harbor, one of them near Harrison
street wharf with 26 feet of water over it,
and another where tne depth of water was
28 feet. The rocks will soon be in iicated
as danger exists that a battle-ship might
toucG one of them during a spring tide.
CLIFTON MUST PAY.
Judgment Obtained for the Price of
Polo Breeches for tho
Hunt Bait.
Lord Talhot Clifton must pay for that
pair of ?now white polo breeches that he
ordered from a tailoring establishment in
this City several months ago.
Talbot's wardrobe was deficient in
nether garments when tneHunt bali came
around, and his valet was sent with his
measure â the same cut little figure on
account of the bagginess of the trousers â
to procure the missinc articles forthwith.
The valet cot the pants, but the firm
failed to get its money, though a collector
called persistently at "me lud's" apart
ments with a demand for the coin.
After carrying out the old saying that
"iiatience Ism virtue," as lon gas it thought
it ought, the firm decided to sue. and
placed the matter in the hands of a col
lector.
A complaint calling for $f>7 for one pair
of polo pants and one scarlet dress coat
was accordingly liled, and service made on
tlie noble lord.
The customary number of days passed

murrer entered, and then the majesty of
the law was invoked, and Justice Kerri
gan was asked to give judgment for
plaintiff.
The bailiff's call brought no response
and judgment was entered against his
Lordship with all the solemnity the occa
sion warranted. Now the collector is look
ing for something with which to satisfy
the judgment.
Of cou'.se, he could attach Clifton's fur
niture and bric-a-brac at the Maison Riche,
but that would be cruel, considering how
much his Lordship loves the comforts of
a home fireside and fender, and the col
lector is hoping to meet his debtor and re
ceive his $67 arid costs with all th&t free
handed generosity for which Clifton is
noted.
If the worst comes to the worst, how
ever, the aid of the Sheriff will be invoked,
and some of his Lordship's treasured be
loneings maj' lind their way into the
storehouse of Mr. Whelan.
MRS. YORKE'S EXTRADITION.
Governor Budd Has Not Yet Signed the
Necessary Paper*.
Chief Crowley received a dispatch from
Governor Budd yesterday to forward all
the documents in the case of James A.
Gibson, charged with grand larceny be
fore Judge Low, at the instance of Mrs.

WITH LADS AND LASSIES
Preparations for the Entertain
ment and Social of the Scot
tish Thistle Club.
A Programme cf Vocal and Instru
mental Music, Addresses, Reci
tations ?nd Dancing.
For several weeks past the literary com
mittee of the San Francisco Scottish This
tle Club has been actively engaged making
preparations for the grand quarterly en
tertainment and social to be given under
the auspices of the club tnia evening at
B'nai B'rith Hall.
At a recent committee meeting in the
clubrooms, George W. Paterscm acting
as chairman and J. Gillies tilling the
office of secretary, a great deal of
time was taken up in receiving and con
sidering the reports of the various sub
committees. John D. Coulie reported that
high class talent had been secured. George
G. Watson repotted that arrangements
had been concluded for the decoration of
the hail in a tasteful and artistic manner,
and that as floor manager he had appointed
as assistants O. Brown, W. Gulie.-s T. Fitz

J. Gillies presented an interesting report
on finance and stated that there was a
great demand for tickets. T. Christy an
nounced that the Fairgrieve and Greggs
bands had been secured to furnish music
for the evening and that the services of
I. S. R. Tevendale and Professor McCar

Amonc; the steerage passengers there
were quite a number of notables. T. J.
Adams and A. Dunham came from Samoa.
They are Mormon missionaries and ended
an evangelizing tour on the southern
portion of Ocennica. During their so
journ on ihe liftli continent they made
many converts, and are now returning to'
Utah in a joyful moocL On the way up
ti;ey kept the passengers happy with their
riddle., guitar, flute ami mouth organ and
marie at least one convert. Miss Mori
artey, who came in the steerage, was one
of the members. She is on her way to
meet ber lover.
Another steerage passenger was J. Mc-
Donald, who is on his way to St. Paul to
claim a fortune. A few months aeo he
was struggling to reach Coolgardie. When
he found that the Australian Xl Dorado
wus not what the papers made it out to be
he started L>:iek for Sydney. There the
news came to him that his eldest brother
had tiiect and left him considerable money.
Another passenger is George Christen
sen, who has worked for a number of
years in the Clunes mines, near Ballarat.
He has saved up $000 and is in a hurry to
reach Cripple Creek. The chances are that
he will change his plans and go on one of
the many sailing vessels now fitting ou *
for Alaska.
John Nagle was another passenger, and
he was notable from the fact that, he had a
sack of diamonds with him. As soon as
tue Mariposa left the dock he gave them
into the custody of the purser, and about
once a day he demanded to see them in
order to be sure that none were missing.
There was no loss, and when the vessel
decked yesterday morning NagJe received
his sack without a gem (?) missing. He
thinks he has discovered a diamond field,
and his samples will prove or disprove the
story. The passengers in the steerage call
him "a crank," and the Custom-house
officers were of the same opinion. Purser
Smith was more than glad to get rid of
Nagie's sack of diamonds, as the old man
made his life wtary with his demands to
see the precious "fieras."
Jim Calligan, the popular steerage stew
ard, very nearly made his last voyage
during the run. After leaving Apia he
was taken ill, and it was days before he
recovered. He is now as well as evfer and
his friends were irlad to see him hale and
smiliig when the steamer docked.
The long-looked for Rio de Janeiro got
in yesterday morning. The officers re-
fused to talk, and the chances are that
nothing outside of -what has already been
printed will he given out until the com
pany takes some action. Captnin Russell
says that after "bucking" a head sea for
days and trying oil to calm the waves he
pave it up in despair, set the fore staysail,
and turning around, headed for Honolulu.
In the mat'.er of burning up the state
rooms he says it was a case of necessity
and will so prove to the board of inquiry.
The scliooii'T R. \V. Bartlett has cleared
for Russian territory, and among the pas
seiigers will be C Simon, a young native
son, who has a task in front 01 him which,
micbt make the boldest man quail.
The schooner is laden with steel barges
for the Amoor River, and will reach Nicol
aefsk about the Ist of June, just as the ice
is breaking.
The town is a little place, near the mouth
of the river, away in the dreary north of
Siberia. There are not half a dozen people
in the whole settlement who speak Eng
lis.i, and there is work to be <!one on the
barges which would take forty skilled men
al least eight weeks to accomplish., and
one part of the work is the heating and
driving of a million and a half of steel
rivets.
C. Simon, the youn? California engineer
who has gone out with the title of super
intendent of the reconstruction of barges
on the Amoor River, will have to get his
reconstruction done as best he can by a
band of Russian convicts, who are not
skilled at all and who have a routed aver
sion to work of any kind. Another diffi
culty will be that the English language is
not an accomplishment taught the con
victs, and the California engineer knows
no Russian.
However, he expects to worry along
romiortably enough with his convicts,
when lie once gets used to them, and he
pays lie is resolved that if he can help it
they will not be urged to increased activity
by the use of the knout.
It is about ten months since the Union
Iron Works obtained tlie contract to sim
ply the Amoor Steam Trading and Navi
gation Company with eleven steel barges
for use on the Amoor River in transport
ing material for the Siberian Railroad.
The bids were open to the whole world,
and the European press commented a
!?oo't deal on the fact that California,
where labor was much dearer, .should
have bet n able to underbid the older coun
tries. Five hundred men have been work
ing for the last eight months on the
barges. K;ich is 196 feet over all, 180 feet
on deck and ;ij-foot beam. They will be
used to carry construction materials, as
well aÂ« cattle and provisions, for the work
m-n on the trans-Siberian line.
Nine of the buries went this morning in
the K. W. Bartlett and the remaining two
will shortly follow in the James If. Cole
man, which will also take the boiler and
machinery for a sternwheei steamer to run
on the Amoor. The contract only calls
for the delivery of the material at the
wharf in San Francisco, but the Amoor
Steam Trading Company has chartered
the steamers and has engaged the Califor
nia engineer to superintend the construc
tion of the bargns. He goes alone to super
intend the work, his contract calling for
the completion of the work in not less
than six nor more than ten months.
C. Simon, who is not more tlian twenty
three years of age, is wvll known and pop
ular in the Potrero. He is president of
the Christian Endeavor Society at Olivet
Piesbyterian Church and last Monday was
given a grand farewell reception by the
young people of Rev. Dr. Mathena's con
gregation.
M'CREERY'S BLOCK.
Handsome Property at McAllister and
Baker Streets to Change Ownership.
The handsome block at Baker and Mc-
Allister streets, owned by A. B. McCrecry
for the past forty years, is to be sold.
Property-owners on the panhandle and
the public at large are to be congratulated
on the liberal policy of A. B. McCreery,
which is to sell his unimproved land as
soon as there is a demand on the part of
tue public for it.
Four years ago Air. McCreery owned half
a dozen blocks on the park panhandle. In
stead of holding tiiis property and thus re
tarding the growth or the City in that di
rection, he has sold land to the value of
$400,000, upon which improvements have
been erected which have udded to the as
sessment-roll UDward of $200,000.
This is the last of the McCreery blocks,
and it will be sold at auction by his agents,
Baldwin Â«fe Hammond, on the 16th inst.
The terms will be one-fourth cash. As
there is considerable building now going
on in this section, it is safe to predict that
in a short time this now vacant block will
be graced by a number of improvements.
Stabbed by a Stranger.
J. W. Ryan, 51 Firststreet, went into asaloon
on Fourth street yesterday morning with a
friend and while reading ihe morning papers
his friend got mto an altercation with
a stranger. Ryan interfered and the stranger
stabbed him iii the leit arm with a knife. He
was taken to the Receiving Hospital, where the
wound was dressed.
A very large part of human ills are cured by
Mitchell's Magic Lotion. â¢
A SUMMER OF BASEBALL
The Promise That a New League
Holds Out to San Fran
cisco.
GROUNDS ON FOLSOM STREET.
Plans to Put Six or Eight Teams in
the Field Within Two
Months.
"The California Baseball League" was
organized last night and teams made up
of the well-known players now in this
State will begin a series of games about
June 1.
D. R. McNeill is president of the new
organization, A. S. Blake, who was for
merly in the New England League, is sec
retary, and F. A. Dun bar is the treasurer.
Others interested in the venture are G. A.
Johnson of San Jose, J. P. Stowell of Los
Angeles and H. N. Wilson of this City.
Mr. Blake, acting in the interests of the
prospective league, has secured the
grounds bounded by Folsom, Fifteenth,
Sixteenth and Harrison streets, and last
night he presented to the league his report
ot the lease.
This Held is known as the Mechanics'
Institute property.
Mr. Biake announced that work on the
improvement of the ground and the erec
tion of a fence will be immediately begun.
His measurement of the field is 560x520
feet. One advantage is that the place is
sheltered from wind and fog, and another
is that it may be easily reached. Tne
held is regarded as well adapted for use as
a ball ground.
Rube Levy and all the old-time players
that remain here will be put on the league
list, but no attempt to enter into competi
tion for well-known players outside of
California will be made.
The cities to put teams in the field are
enumerated as follows: San Francisco,
Oakland, San Jose, Sacramento, Stockton,
Fresno, Los Angeles. It is believed that
one or two other cities may also enter the
league.
A minor league to develop baseball
talent will be favored.
Mr. Blake and Mr. Dunbar were ap
pointed a committee to urge the Southern
Pacific Company to establish a station at
Sixteenth and Harrison streets.
The projectors say they are confident
t hat baseLall will pay here this season.
Beat His Wife.
E. B. McManus, a purser on one of the coast
ing steamers, was arrested yesterday on a
warrant at the instance of his wife charging
him with battery upon her. About a week ago
he beat her without any provocation and she
wanted him punished for it. The couple have
three young children.
A Missing Husband.
Mrs. Louis Bernstein, 4-14 Natoma street, re
ported at police headquarters yesterday that
her husband had left his home two weeks aeo
and had not returned. He is a cohtmaker by
trade, 38 years of age, f feet s'< inches tall,
slim build. brown mustache and nair and wore
a gray sack suit.

did not detract in the least from the at
tendance at the new course yesterday, and
the racing was above the average. Out
siders in the betting predominated, for but
two rir-t choices r>oked their noses past
the wire in :ront. In tne way of long odds
Ihe Judge carried off the honors, taking
the second event at odds of 40 to 1.
The opening event was a rive and a half
furiong spin for maiden three-year-olds.
The Spreckels entry Carnation was a hot
4 to 5 choice, but after leading to within a
few yards of the wire was beaten out a
."â¢hort head by the 15 to 1 cnance Globe,
ridden by Slaughter. Imp. Alien was
third.
'Ihe betting on the six-furlong run that
followed was very open. Tobey at 10 to 5
was blightly over Gold Bug, who went to
the post at fours. In a hard drive. Boze
man astride the outsider The Judge got
his mount past the wire a short half length
in advance of Huntsman, fairly well
played at good odds. Gold Bug, who was
inclined to run out in tne stretch, was a
close third.
That very promising youngster, George
Palmer, carrying the red, white and blue
colors of the Jockey Club's president. A.
B. i-y-reckels. easily disposed of the seven
youngsters opposed to tiim in the four
furlong sprint for two-year-olds, starting
a B to 10 choice. He beaded Rosella m
ihe stretch and beat her oat easily by a
length and a half, witu Sister Adella fin
ishing in the show.
A Handicap at a mile clearly demon
trated that the handicapper underes
timated the capabilities of W. B. Sink's
mare Sister Mary. Starting at odds of 4
to 1, she lingered in an advantageous po
sition to the stretch, where she assumed
the lead and won galloping, with Sam
Leake finishing in the place. Imp. Miss
Bruiuniel, the favorite, was a fair third.
The winner went to the post at 4 to 1.
Bookmaker George Rose's horse Nephew

had first call in the betting on the mile and I
a sixteenth run, decided under selling con- i
ditions, and the same o!a cripple won in '
the most exciting drive of the day. Open
ing at 6 to 5 he went to 8 to 5," at which â¢
price he went to the post. The Duchess â 
of Milpitas made the running to the
stretch, with Trix and Nephew close up. '
Bergen gradually worKed the favorite into
the lead, and in a rattling arive snatched '
the race by a nose from the fast-coming i
Foremost ridden by Macklin. Trix was a
close third.
A six-furlong sprint that concluded the
day's sport again upset the talent's pre
dictions. Mobalasca carrying 03 pounds
was chosen to carry the bulk of the coin,
beinp backed from" twos to 8 to 5, receding,
however, at post time to 9 to 5, vying with
Mount McGregor II for favoritism honors.
The third cnoice, Babe Murphy, made a
fine run tbrougn the stretch, and head
ing both of the favored ones in the
bettine, passed the judses a handy
winner.

WORKMEN'S LABORS END
Many Important Constitutional
Amendments Passed Yes
terday.
POLAND AGAIN GRAND DEPUTY
A Resolution Carried Appropriating
$6000 for Extension
Work.
Yesterday was the third day's session of
the annual meeting of the Grand Lodge
Frank S. Poland, Who Has Been Appointed Deputy GranJ Master of the A. o
1. AY. for the Eleventh Time.
of United Workmen. It was expected
that all the rc-raaining business of the
organization would be transacted by a late
hour nr the afternoon, but it was found
necessary to hold until (3 o'clock in the
evening, take an adjournment till 7 and
finish as soon after that as possible, and a
resolution to this effect was carried. Later
it was thought ben not to adjourn at H
o'clock, but to continue the session until
all business was off the body's hands, and
this was decided upon by motion after a
short debate.
The consideration of amendments was
first in order. The first provided that the
office of grand trustees be abolished and
that their duties hereafter devolve on the
finance committed. It was adupteU with
little discussion.
The next amendment provided that the
offices of grand Â«vide an i inside and out
side watchmen be made appointive in
stead of elective. It wasarcued that these
are unimportant offices and require much
more time in being riiled than is due
them. The amendment was adopted after
a short debate.
An amendment was introduced on the
score of economy, making the mileage
rates one-third less than existing rate, but
was defeated.
The special committee on the claim of
the relatives of W. J. Barry, who mys
teriously disappeared seven years ago, "re
ported favorably. It was then ordered
that the claim be paid.
The claim of the relatives of the de
ceased D. E. Gordon was also ordered
paid.
After other minor business had been
transacted the meeting adjourned until 2
o'clock in the afternoon.
The first proposition to come up was
whether an official organ should be estab
lished or whether the iraternal items
should be published in one of the ertat
dailies. Bids from two of tnese hadl>een
submitted lor the consideration of the
order, but the idea did not meet with
much approval. The debate on the sub
ject was warm and protracted, but it was
clearly to be seen from the start that the
general consensus ot opinion was adverse
to puUishiug the fraternal news in a daily
paper and favorable to an official organ to
be devoted entirely to the needs and wel
fare of the organisation. The question
was finally referred to the consideration of
the corporate directors.
A resolution to appropriate ?GOOO for ex
tension work, the general upbuiiiiing and
propagation of the order, was carried by a
large vote.
A resolution creating the office of attor
ney and counselor of the order with sal
ary fixed at $500 per annum was also car
ried, with the proviso that it meet the
favor of the corporate directors.
A constitutional amendment to hold
biennial sessions was defeated.
The report of the committee on honored
dead to present *. tribute to deceased mem
bers was adopted by a rising vote, i
All committee reports having been re
ceived and acfd on, the officers-elect were
duly installed according to the rites pecu
liar to the society by Past Supreme Master
Workman William H. Jordan.
The following appointments were an
nounced :
Deputy grand master, Frank S. Poland;
grand lecturer. Edwin Danforth; finance
committeeâ William Brodenck, Thomas
VV. Bethel, E. J. Fennon; board of arbi
trationâ 'William 11. Jordan, George B.
Xatzenstein, E. Danforth, Taylor Rogers,
Eugene M. Deujjrey.
A few minor details in business matters
were settled, and a motion to adjourn un
til the next annual session in Aprtl of next
year was made and carried. Amid cheers,
handshakings and general congratulations
ended the annual session of the A. O. U.
. Everything has progressed smootiilv,
delegates are delighted and, though tired
out by the arduous labor, all look forward
to the next annual session.

Ziegier will arrive from Philadelphia on
Tuesday next, and as the boxing tourna
ment will not take place until the evening
of May 1. the PhiJadelphian will have
ample time to condition himself for a ten
round content with the clever welter-weight
of the Olympic Ciub.
Z-.egler looks every inch a fighter. He
is 5 feet S iuthes in height and fights best
at 140 pounds. Green is 5 feet 8^ inches
and will right at 145 pounds.
According to an agreement which has
been approved of by both men, the pugil
ists will box at catch weights. Ziegler is
25 years old and has, during the iast rive
years, met and successfully defeated a
number of good men. His hardest battles
were against Horace Leeds, Stantou Ab
bott, Jack McAuliffe and Eyerhardt. His
trainer, Huyrh Kennedy, will accompany
him to this City.
George Green will be trained by Frank
Fester at the Olympic Club's "outdoor
grounds.
Arthur Walker, the Australian welter
weight pugilist, arrived yesterday from
New Yorkâ just in time to be too late for
a match with Green. Walker says that he
will meet any nian of his class in" America,
either in a limited contest or a '"go" to the
finisn. He is on his way to Australia.
The Olympic Club may possibly match
big John Miller against Van Buskirk for a
bout of four or six rounds, to take place on
the evening of the May tournament. Both
men are willing to box.
On Sunday the first of a series of run
nine races will be held at the outdoor
grounds of the Olympic Club. The dis
tance is 100 yards, and entries will be re
ceived at the ground?. On Sunday, the
19th insr., a 220-yard race will take place,
and on the Sunday following the final race
ofÃHoyardÂ« will be decided. The contest
ants winning the createst number of point*
will receive medals.
THE OREGON GRAY BEATEN
Colusa Stone Will Be Used in
the New Union F^rry
Depot.
Papers Fi'ed in the $40,000 L bel
Damage Su.t Against Com
missioner Co!non.
The Board of Harbor Commissioner? de
cided yesterday to substitute the Sites
stone of the Colusa quarry for the Oregon
gray stone, as specified in the plans and
specifications for the new ferry station.
A light is expected to follow on the heels
of this action. It is generally believed the
proDhets of the board will not be disap
pointed, as all the unsuccessful contractors
who bid on the work are in league against
the Commissioners and the contractors
whose tenders were accepted.
At, the meeting of the Harbor Commis
sioners yesterday afternoon Mr. Mc-
Carthy, the contractor on the mason work,
was one of the most interested spectators
next to W. Farwell of the Niles quarry,
who has made a strong fight for his stone.
The odd? were against him.
The board's architect, Mr. Swain, and
Engineer Holmes were positive in their
opinion that the Coiusa stone, the price
being the same as that of the Oregon gray,
was the better. Their inrestigation bad
convinced them that the Sites stone, after
long exposure to the elements, showed no
sign of disintegration, and in the case of
tome of the quarry's product in use on the
steps leadine up to the main entrance of
the Catholic church in Colusa for eighteen
years the tooling was almost as distinct as
when laid in place by the masons.
In the case of the Niles stone no objec
tion as to it? durable qualities was made,
but Messrs. Swain and Holmes were of the
opinion that it would be difficult to quarry
the stone in the specified dimensions. In
the minds of the?e two experts a grave
doubt existed as to the possibility of quar
rying the requisite sized blocks.
Mr. Farweli demurred to this opinion,
but it did nira no good.
The Gites stone will be used unless the
uiiMiccefsful bidders succeed in compel
ling the Commissioners throuch the courts
to hold to the original specification*.
Attorney Stratton holds that the board
had tne ripht to take this action, but in
the event that trouble ensues he ordered
that the proviso be made in the amended ;
specifications that the original contract
and specifications shall be binding on
both parties.
Mr. Gorall of the Pacific Bridge Com
pany, who is understood to be back of the
McCarthy tender, agreed to the proviso,
and thus the matter stands until ihi in
evitable fieht comes.

I Gee ilanaser. Gen. AM .JUST AS MOSES MADE IT
A Seventh â¢ Bay Adventist
Preacher Reconstructs the
Tabernacle.
OVERLAID WITH PUiIE GOLD.
Tap.stries and Drinking-Cups Made in
Arab aâ One-El venth the Origi
nal Size.
An exact model of the Mosaic Taber
nacle, which has cost its maker years of
labor and thousands of dollars, is just be
ompleted in this City. Only a few
finishing touches are needed and then,
vrobabiy for the first time in history,
there will exist a reproduction, as far as
modern knowledge can reproduce it, of
the wonderful place of worship which
Moses constructed under divine guidance.
The model wiii be only one-eleventh the
size of tin' original tabernacle, but even on
that diminutive scale it has been a very
costly piece of work, for it contains $8000
worth ul pure gold, not to mention the
silver, brass, ivory, costly wood, skins,
embroideries and precious stuffs,
: . of which have boon woven at great
â  !i Arabian looms.
The constructor of the tabernacle is Rev.
J. \V. Kelchner, a Seventh-day Adventist
;. readier of lowa, who is an acknowledged
authority on the subject of much that per
tains to the Mosaic dispensation. Mr.
Kelchuer lectured for some years on the
subject of the tabernacle, and believing
that he could bring the subject home
much more clearly to his hearers if he had
a model, he set to work to construct one.
The vastness oi his undertaking dawned
upon the Adventist as he progressed with
hu work, but by that time ho had become
interested, and was resolved to spare
. r t:me nor money. It was easy
enough, he says, to get the gold, the brass
and the marble; even the precious woods
were not so difficult to procure: but the
curtains, the skins and the embroideries
were almost impossible to reproduce ex
actly. However, Mr. Kelchner sent minute
instructions to the Orient. Paintings and
sketches were made by artists in Chicago
and New York, and, acting under these
instructions, Arabian women wove the
rugs and the curtains, and their skilled
lingers traced out the embroideries,
which, boin^ only one-eleventh of the
Original size, were almost ini.nitesimal.
ahe blue and purple and scarlet of the
different textures did not always harmon
ize, as they must have done in the Mosaic
Tabernacle, and this led Mr. Kelchner to
experiment largely with difFerent dyes till
he had succeeded in blendinshis tints.
Several of the leading architects and
painters in the East were also consulted,
in order to secure perfect harmony of de
t.iil in the construction. Skilled "jewelers
were employed in laying on the gold and
silver and in making the candlesticks,
cherubim, etc., while expert carvers were
â¢ inj 'dyed for the ivory and woodwork.
The drinking vessels were made to order
in Arabian potteries.
All this occupied several years. Before
exhibiting his tabernacle Mr. Kelchner
resolved to have a large background
painted representing Mount Sinai, with
I itta oi the Israelites at its base, as
they were during the Mosaic encamp
ment. It was the desire to have this pic
ture painted by an artist who had made a
special study of Biblical subjects which
led him \<> California. Wilbur A. Reasor
lias devoted three years of work abroad to
:_: Scriptural painting and is well
known as an illustrator of sacred books.
It was to him that Mr. Kelchner was ad-
Lgo to fto for bis painting of
Mount Sinai, aud being in a hurry 10 see
ljis work ended heat ouce packed up the
ITCKi pieces of which his model consists
and set off to California.
He arrived a few days ago and found
Wilbur Keasor busy preparing to leave for
Europe. However, he consented to delay
his departure a couple of weeks, in order
to paint Mount Sinai, and now both the
artist and the Seventh-day Adventist
Bpend most of the hours of daylight in the
studio watching the growth of the moun
tain, which is beinn paiuted from photo
graphs made in the Holy Land.
Mr. Kelcbner considers that in three
weeks his tabernacle will be ready for lec
turing purposes, and he intends to set it
up in some large hall in this City. Speak
ing yesterday of the difficulties with which
he has had to contend, he said: ''There
are no recognized historical authorities on
the subject. Many of the great buildings
and constructions of antiquity are de
scribed by ancient writera, but we have no
account of the tabernacle by any one who
has seen it. In working from the account
given in Exodus it was difficult to get
things to harmonize, and I had to obtain a
great deal of assistance from architects.
"A Methodist writer named Strong re
produced the tabernacle, on paper at least,
a few years ago. and he may have made
kind of a model, but Biblical author
ities have stated that he rnaae a number of
errors. I have taken advantage of the
criticisms passed on his work, and have
i ' tainc-d a good deal of assistance in that
way.
â¢ My model is sixteen feet long, and
both within and without it is made as far
aÂ« possible of the materials indicated in
Exodus. The walls of the tabernacle are
of burnished gold, the law is written on
tablets of marble and the ark is made
minutely according to the written instruc
tions."
The tabernacle has never yet been ex
hibited, except to a few artists and archi
tects in Chicago, who were interested
enough to request a private view.
SALMON IN THE SENATE
Perkins' Bill fcr an Appropria
tion Has a Local Sig
nificance.
The Batfe Creek Hatchery to BÂ»

California Fish Commissioners are
pleased over the prospects of the
1- c leral authorities coming to their assist
ance in regard to Battle <"rÂ»ek salmon
hati bery on tbe Sacramento liiver.
I here is a deeper significance, however,
In the action of the United States Fish
Commissioners regarding the hatching of
salmon thin attaches to our hatchery
Bion*', said William C. Murdoch, presi
dent of the California Fish Commission,
yesterday. "We are interested, of course,
more directly in what affects California,
but beyond that we see the importance of
I stering the salmon industry on the Pa
cific < oust.
'\\ uh tais end in view. Senator Perkins
has fust introduced in Congress a bill pro
viding for an appropriation of $35,000 for
Kihnou hutcherios on the Pacific Coast.
'â¢The I nitedÃUtesFiah< om mission has
been in communication with us and Sena
tor Perkins, ami with its support there is
little if any doubt bat that the fS.OUO
:i-kec} will be appropriated without delay
The United States commission ha? made
an exhaustive study of the question of
salmon-hatching. It has examined all
parts of the country and arrived at the
conclusion that salmon can be hatched
only on the l'aciiic Coast. Even we have
found that salmon does not hatch well
everywhere in California. The one point
above all that has proved most successful
is the hatchery at Battle Creek. There is
another very fertile spot in Washington,
and I believe some places in Oregon.
"Tl>a step taken by Senator Perkins
practically settles the fate of our hatchery
at llittle Creek. The State could not
afford to maintain it, so the Government
is willing to take the hatchery and keep
it going. For thiÂ« we are to get two-thirds
>f the entire number of salmon hatched.
That would leave 10,000,000 young salmon
a year for the United States, ever so many
more than it could raise elsewhere. It
would also supply all the salmon streams
and leave us a plentiful supply for Califor
nia. The United State: wouid most likely
send its. share to the rivers of the North
west to stock them for the salmon fishers,
and send large numbers to other parts of
the country.
"The Shimon-fishing industry is the most
important of all industries oh the Pacific
Coast, and the United States intends to
foster it. We will be pleased, also, as oth
erwise we could not maintain the hatchery
at Battle Creek."
A JUSTIFIABLE KILLING.
â¢lames BlcXulty Not Itrapoiislble for the
Death of .1. B. Harrington.
A Coroner's jury yesterday held that
.Tames McNuity was justified in shooting
James E. Harrington. The latter died at
the Receiving Hospital on April 3. He
and a companion named Macnamara en
tered McNuity '3 saloon, at the corner of
Mission and Sixteenth street^, and threat
ened to "do him up." McNuity tired a
shot into the ceiling to frighten them, and
then shÂ«y left the place.
A short time afterward McNuity closed
his saloon for the night and was on his
way home, when Harrington and Mac
namara again threatened him. They fol
lowed him to the door of liis home and
were forcing their way into the house when
he fired the fatal shot. The bullet entered
Harrington's abdomen.
Harrington had a bad reputation. He
was known as ''Bullhead' 1 Harrington.
Jle was 2.2 years of age.

Letter From Mr. Bernard to the Man

Association.
For over a year the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association has been endeav
oring to secure to Californian business
houses the contracts for supplying State
institutions. Last year there was some
correspondence on the matter between the
association and Secretary Bernard of the
Preston School of Industry at lone. The
secretary promised to do what he could to
recommend the idea to the trustees of the
institution, and as a result of his efforts
; the following letter was received yester
day at the rooms of the association :

Sir: Authority having beta duly vested in me
by virtue of a resolution of the honorable
board of trustees of the Preston School of In

to prospective bidders on furnishing

used by me at t lie lost awarding of contracts,
this In accordance with my promise to that

These schedules are submitted for your sug

I above, for it is and has always been my desire
; to see the home manufacturer or producer af

market. Kindly note the changes desired,
â  and return the BChedules to me at voureariiest
opportunity.
Wishing your organization every prosperity,
I am very truly yours,
H. E. Bernard, Secretary.
The schedules mention all kinds of sup
plies generally needed in public institu

stitution of home products for imported
ones in the annual award will be a step in
the direction along which the association's
efforts aie Vicing put forth.
"It will be a great thing for California,' 1
remarked Assistant Secretary Dingle, "if
the other institutions can be induced to
follow the example of the Preston School.
The certainty of a market at home will
give an impetus to home manufacturers
and producers which must bring a great
change for the better in the business of
the State."

Fujiwara reported the case to Captain
Dur.levy, who advised him to go to the

ROBBED TELEPHONE BOXES
Joseph O'Donnell, an Ex-Mes
senger-Boy, Caught in
the Act.
HE CONFESSES HIS GUILT.
The Sunset Telephone Company Esti
mates the Amount Stolen at
About $300.
The thief who has been robbing the
nickel-in-the-slot boxes of the Sunset Tele
graph and Telephone Company has bean
captured. His name is Joseph O'Donnell,
an ex-messenger-boy, who has descended
to crime to get money to satisfy his crav
ing for opium.
The first discovery of the thefts occurred
on March IS at the telephone in Cables &
Bailey's saloon, 121 Montgomery street.
When the monthly collection was made
there were only a few nickels in the box
instead of from $8 to $10 as formerly.
Since then the boxes in the following
Telephone-Box Containing the Nickels,
Show ing Burglar- Alarm Attachment.
places were found to have been rifled of
their contents: Cafe Royal, Market and
Fourth streets; Siebe Bros. & Plagemann,
wholesale liijuor, 328 Sansomo street;
Silver Dollar Haloon, Hal'eck and Sansome
streets; Fidelia Saloon, 625 Kearny street;
Harnke, grocer, 734 Broadway; Lepori,
hotel and saloon, 511 Broadway ; Lacazette,
saloon, 741 .TacKson street; Barberria, res
taurant, 1318 Stockton street; Ortieu &
Gerhardt, saloon, 125 Powell street; Re
ception Saloon, 200 SutteF street; Wrede,
saloon, (rough and Market streets; Con
stant Saloon, Post and Mason streets;
Signal Transfer Company, (ieary and
Jones streets; Morris, cigar-store, 1500
Market street; Giovannini, coulyard, 812
Pacific street ; Carr, saloon, Sutler street
and Central avenue; the Sutherland
Hotel, 791 Sutter street; Becker, grocer,
631 Sutler street; Searchlight Bureau, real
estate, 602 Market street; Cohn, crockery
store, 1914 Fillmore street.
The places selected were those where the
telephone was in a recess and not in the
line of vision of the occupants. The mo
dus operandi of the thief was to <irop a
nickel in the slot, unlock the box, takeout
the tin receiver for the nicKels and empty
the contents into his pockets.
After the first discoveries were made
new boxes were substituted with a slit in
them, but me thief was not to be balked.
He stole the box itself. Tnen a special
stamp was designed to seal each box, but
it had no effect.
The police were notified, and Detective !
George H. Graham and Policeman A. H.
Holmes were detailed on the case along
with William Brominage of the telephone
company. About a week ago they decided
to recommend that burglar alarms should j
be attached to the boxes. Tnis was done,
and ttie telephone lessees were notified to :
run to the telephone when thuy heard the
alarm ring and hold the thief.
On April 6 the burglar alarm in the tele- ;
phone box at Cables & Bailey's saloon, j
which the thief had again visited, rang, ,
and a rush was made to the telephone.
O'Donnell was found t;.ere with the box
open and the receiver full of nickels in nis
riocket.
He was held till Graham and Holmes
were notified. They took him into cus
tody and he has been detained in tne
"t;mks" at the City Prison since.
O'Donnell since his arrest confessed that '
he was. the thief. He said he got a key to
fit the boxes from a discharged employe of !
ihe telephone company. He went to China- i
town and got a duplicate set of keys made
fur 15 cents. He admitted he and others,
whose names he refused to divulge, had
entered into a conspiracy to go all over
the State and rob all the nickel-in-the-slot
boxes. The confession was made on the
understanding that a light sentence would
be passed upon him. Last night he was I
booKed on one charge of petty larceny
and the sentence will likely be six months.
The company has discharged employes
before who have been caught stealing from
the boxes and this is the first prosecution. I
There are about 3000 of these boxes in the I
City, but those given were the only ones,
robbed by O'Donnell. The exact amount ;
stolen by O'Donnell is not known as no i
record is kept by the company of the ;
nickel-in-the-Blot switches, but it is esti- '
mated it will bebetween $2f>o and $300.
The discharged employe of the company
who pave O'Donnell tne key will not be
prosecuted out of sympathy "for his wife's !
condition.
When O'Donnell was arrested he was
thoroughly searched for the Key, but it
could not be found. A small pocket In the
"Hy" of his trousers was discovered after
ward where he tia'i evidently kept the key.
It was suppored that he had hidden the
key in the cell and magnets were used to
try and rind it without effect, O'Donnell
declines positively to say where he has
placed it.
THE A. O. H. CONVENTION
Prominent Irishmen of the State
to Meet at San Jose in
May.
Fight fir State Secretary, Who Will
Attend t'ae National Convention,
Already On
The annual convention of the Ancient
Order of Hibernians of California will be
held at San Jose early in May, and already
preparations are being made for the event.
Probably the most exciting incident of
the convention will be the election of State
secretary. The fight is being centered on
this office, as ii is regarded as being the
most important in the organization. There
are a number of candidates already in the
field, and the battle will be an interesting
one.
Captain E. I. Sueehan is a candidate for
State secretary and his friends are making
an active canvass for him. He is one of
the foremost Hibernians on the coast and
is a great worker for the cause which the
order represents, the advancement of tbe
religious, civil and social interests of the
Irish-Catholic people. Charles McCarthy
of Oakland is also a candidate lor the
office, but Captain Sheehan's supporters
declare that he will walk away with the
prize.
John Kenny, who is a prominent mem
ber of the order in San Francisco, has also
lately entered the field for State secretary.
As the State secretary will represent
California in the National convention,
which will be held in Detroit in July, and
which will be attended by some 200,000
delegates, a lively interest is being taken
in the coming contest.
The annual communion of the four divi
sions of the Ancient Order of Hibernians
of Oakland will take place at the Church
of the Immaculate Conception at the 8
o'clock mass on Sunday morning next. It
is expected that Archbishop Riordan will
be present and deliver an address.
HOW BOLDT GOT EVEN.
A. Sftloon-Keeper Whacks a Man With a
Bung-Starter Because He Didn't
Buy a Drink.
H. Boldt keeps a grocery and saloon on
Eighth and Folsom streets. A few nights
aso Jacob Kerns, a laborer, living in the
Harmony Hotel, on Brannan street, went
into a rear room of the saloon, where- he
remained for a few minutes, and was leav
ing without purchasing a drink. This an
gered Boldt.
"How much do you weigh ?" Boldt
asked him. "I have a bet with this friend
of mine and want to settle it."
"I don't know," said Kerns, "what lay
weight is. I haven't been weighed fora
long time."
"Well," said Boldt, "let's have a drink
on the subject."
They had a drink and then Boldt's friend
grabbed hold of Kerns and lifted him off
Ins feet. Boldt took a bung-starter and
whacked Kerns over the hips and back
with it to such an extent that Kerns was
confined to his bed for tliree days.
Kerns as soon as he was able to leave the
house swore out a warrant for Boldt's ar
rest on a charge of battery. Tue case was
settled in Judge Joaciiimsen's court yes
terday, and Boldt was convicted and or
dered to appear for sentence to-morrow.
MONUMENT AT MONTEREY
Achievements of Commodore
Slcat to Be Commem
oraied.
Every County in the Slate of California
Invited to Contribute a
Stone.
The Sloat Monument Association met
at the Occidental Hotel yesterday after
noon. The members present were Dr.
Washington Aver, president; Captain W.
L. Duncan, first vice-president; Colonel
Joseph Stewart, second vice-president;
M;ijor Edwin A. Sherman, secretary; Jesse
I). Carr, Dr. James L. Gogftsweli, Wiiiiara
Frank Pierce and Colonel Frank Pierce,
ne phew of ex-President Pierce.
In calling the meeting to order President
Aver said :
For the information of the gentlemen pres
ent I will state that this meeting was called
for the purpose of making arrangements to lay
the cornerstone of a monument to be erected
at Monterey in honor of Commodore Sloat ana
in commemoration of his heroic exploit in
raising the stars and stripes, which gave free
dom to a misruled people and gave birth to a
new civilization to the whole of the Pacific
Coast from the Straits of Magellan to the Si
berian Â£on, and secured 168,000 square- miles
of new territory to the United States and the
brightest star in the constellation of States.
Fifty years from the date of that memorable
event it is eminently proper, right and impor
tant that we should' Rive some enduring ex
pression of gratitude to the hero who secured
such abenetaction for all ' generations yet. to
b3. Then let t lie granite shaft tell the story of
a Nation's gratitude and tht bronze statue" re
ceive the first ra>s of the morning sun to glad
den the eye and keep his memory green.
It was resolved that the Board of Super
visors of each county in California be in
vited to attend the cornerstone celebra
tion at Monterey on July 7 next, and to
lurnish a stone of the uniform sisa re
quired, with the dire of the comfy and
its organization cut thereon. The dimen
sions of me stone are to be three feet
lons, two feet wide and eighteen inches
thick.
It was the sense of the meeting that no
stone prepared by prison !;Ux>r should he
used. The stones are to be eit er granite
or marble, and if practicable to be quarried
in the counties respectively contributing.
Letters were read from" United States
Senator Perkins, unit the meeting ex
tended a vote of thanks to the Senator.
The official report and orders of Commo
dore Sloat were also read. Some historical
information was giv*n as to the manner in
which the commodore, at Mazittlau, ob
tained authentic news that hostilities had
begun between the United States and
Mexico.
From copies of official records and corre
spondence in the possession of Major Sher
man, the tact is established that Commo
dore Sloat received the first definite intel
ligence of the war from the fleet surgeon,
Dr. Maxwell Wood.
The burgeon was dispatched from Mazat
lan to the exterior of Mexico, and after a
long and perilous journey returned with
the news ol the buttle of Palo Alto. Those
facts were reported to John Parrott, United
States Consul at Mazatlan, and to Commo
dore Sloat. This was on June 7, 184t>.
Thereupon Commodore .Sloat mailed for
Monterey and a month later took posses
sion of California in the name of the
United States.
Many interesting Incidents concerning
the movements of Admiral Seymour of the
British frigate Collingwood are noted in
the data. Minor events concerning the
landing of marines, the detail for hoistine
the liag at Monterey, the detachment of
the ship Portsmouth for San Francisco,
the arrival of the United States ship Con
gress in Monterey Bay, and the arrival
also of H. 13. M. BBip Collin^wood.
The Mexican Veterans, the Masonic fra
ternity and Knights of Pythias at Mon
terey are taking an active interest in the
work of arranging for the cornerstone
ceremonies.
Assurance has been received from Wash
ington thut the Secretary of War will de
tail an officer to join the association in
selecting a site for the monument on the
Government reservation at Monterey.
One of the letters mentioned from BÂ°n
ator Perkins bears date March 30, 1896,
and is addressed to George Edwards,
Berkeley. The Senator writes:
"Although the previous conduct of Com
modore Sloat has no bearing upon the fact
that the United States took possession of
California on a given date, which action is
to be commemorated, it may be well to
again point out that there are among the
records of the Navy Department no docu
ments reflecting upon the oth'cer in con
nection with this matter. In fact there
port of the Secretary of the Navy,
December 5, 1816, says of the manner in
which Sloat carried out his instructions,
that he 'observed the line of conduct pre
scribed to him with such intelligence and
fidelity that no complaint has ever been
made of any unauthorized suggestion on
his part.' "
Senator Perkins also says: "The most
diligent search by Lieutenant Young in
the archives of the Navy Department has
failed to bring forth any document or
reference which detracts from Commodore
Stoat's reputation as a faithful officer."
These facts were presented to show
clearly that Bancroft's history had not
dealt fairly with Commodore Sloat.
Hit With a Lead Pipe.
Charles Oleson, keeper of a rooming-house
at 11C Steuart street, was taking to the Receiv
ing Hospital yesterday afternoon to have a
lacerated wound in his scalp dressed. He was
protecting Sauie Holmes, one ot his roomers,
from Timothy Muldooncy, her lover, who was
threatening to kill her, when Muldooney
whacked him over the head with a piece of
lead pipe. After his wound was dressed Ole
son swore out a warrant for Muldooney's arrest
on the charge of assault with a deadly weapon .
THEY LOOK FOR DELAY.
The Contestants of the Fair
Will Still Talking of
Forgery.
A MOVE IN COURT TO-DAY.
It Is Not Expected It Will Reach
the Jury for Some Little
Time.
The matter of the contest of the will of
James Q. Fair, dated September 24, will
come up before Judge Slack this morning.
The matter comes up under the contest
tiled by Judge Paterson on behalf of Her
man Oelrichs Jr. and the other minor chil
dren interested.
As Ctiarles L. Fair has since then filed a
contest, it is more than likely thai no defi
nite steps will be taken, but that the mat
ter will go over for a week or ten days, ac
cording to the slow processes of law.
Still, there is no telling what a day may
develop in the Fair will case. The unex
pected has happened so regularly in this
matter that the greatest surprise now in
reserve is that the expected should happen.
Knight & Heggerty say they are pre
pared to follow the course they have
marked out. They will go forward with
their contest.
"We have changed front with regard to
the will of the 24th, because we do not now
believe that it is the will of James G.
Fuir," they say, "and we believe that we
will be able to prove that it is not so con
clusively that even our opponents will be
convinced. We believe that it is a forgery
and that we will be able to show that it is
a forgery.
"We realized some time ago that we had
been played for suckers on this will and the
proofs have been coming along in a pro
cession ever since. Who is the forcer?
Well, that is a part of our case, and we do
not care to state at this time.
"It is not true," said Mr. Heggerty yes
terday, "that we submitted the pencil will
to the inspection of the intimates of Mr.
Fair for inspection and secured their writ
ten indorsement of it. We retained the
principal experts in town, that is true, hut
I believe that only one of them saw the
will. At least only one reported on it.
"No, I don't believe the case will get to
trial for some time yet. This tiling ol ask
inc for a trial, pushing a jury into the box
and truing right along taking evidence is
not to be expected in a matter of this
importance. Wnen it does come to trial,
however, I am of the opinion that conclu
sions will be reached quickly. It will not
be the long straggle before the jury that
seems to be expected."
FAVOR PENNY POSTAGE.
The Merchants' Association's Letter to
the California Delegation.
Among the advocates of the proposed
1-cent postal rate for letters the Merchants'
Association of this City has always been
prominent. Yesterday the association
mailed copies of the following letter to

duction of letter postage to 1 cent. â 
This association, therefore, respectfully re
quests you to support the bill ior tno above
purpose now pending in Congress, and would

A Coroner's Juror's Dissent.
Otto Anderson held out against the jury in
the case of James Johnson yesterday. It ap
pears that on April 1 last Johnson was assail
ing an old man on Third and Hunt streets,
when Hugh Smith went to the rescue of the
latter. He struck Johnson and the latter fell
backward and fractured his skull, dyinfir later
from his injuries. There were a number of
witnesses who' testified that Smith did not
strike Johnson, and a verdict of -occidental
death whs 'â â  returned. Juror Anderson dis
sented, holding Smith responsible for John
son's death. The evidence showed lint Smith's
mother saw Johnson assault the old man and
called to her son to prevent him from killing
him, as she thought he was trying to do.

ing. Delegates from all the cities in the !
central portion of the State are to be pres- !
ent, and it is expected that the iarpe Conn- ;
cil hall of the new municipal building will
be thronged.
Four addresses are to be delivered by I
Alanieda men. The subject is, "Pulpit, j
Prei<s and Public Library as Means of In- j
fluencing Public Opinion and Elevating \
Humanity." The speakers are Rev. George i
K. D'-dson of the First Unitarian Society; ;
T. G. Daniells. editor of the Alameaa j
Argus; D. J. Sullivan, Superintendent of
Schools in Alameda, and Principal Ergo
Majors of the Alamtda High School.
The fund for a new library building is
being rapidly raised, and it is believed that
within a few months the work on the
structure will be commenced.
In 1877 the library was established with
about 500 volumes. Dr. William P. Gib
bons was the president of the first board
of trustees and George H. Mastick was the
secretary. The library was rirst located at
Park Opera-house. It was removed to
Tuckers Hall at the end of a year and re
mained there rntil the present quarters on
Park street were obtained.
Librarian Harbourne, in a historical
sketch, says:
The State Legislature on March 18. 1878,
having passed an act providing for the main
tenance of public libraries by a special tax
levy, the trustees, on August o\ 1878. in
structed Drs. Gibbons and McLean to appear
before the Hoard of Town Trustees and offer to
give its property to the City and ask for its
co-operation and the appointment of a com
mittee of conference. Town Trustees George
N. Williams, W. B. Clement and J. B. Vosburgn
were appointed such committee on conference,
but not until the last day of the year was the
proposition reported on and unanimously
adopted. The Free Library thus passed under
municipal control, to be maintained by public
tax as provided i n the net of 1878.
The first meeting of tho Trustees of the Ala
meda Free Library and Reading-room was held
on January 9, 1879, with J. C. Tucker, George
N. Williams, Daniel T. Sullivan, George H.
Mastick and Mrs. John Green acting for the
town of AlamtMia, and Thomas A. W. P.
Gibbons and W. U. Clement aud Mesdames Mar
garet \\. Andrews arid Helen M. Brown as Hon
orary Trustees, representing the old associa
tion.
Dr. Gibbons was chosen president, Thomas
A. Smith vice-president and George H. Mastick
secretary, and on the 28th day of February,
1879. the library was opened for the circula
tion of books, with George H. Stripp as its
librarian.
1 11 18SO the Legislature passed a library act
taking tin' place of the act of 1878, and mak
ing the office of Library Trustee elective.
From 1880 to 1884 the Library Trustees were
elected, and the last board ejected comprised
M. P. Wiggin, George H. Mastick. W. P. Gib
bons, 3. T. McLean and Thomas A. Smith.
In 1884 the town of Aiameda passed into a
city of the fifth class, and under the corporate
law the Library Trustees were appointive. Tfte
tirst board, appointed December 29, 1894, was
composed of Dr. William P. Gibbons, George H.
Mti-tuk, M. P. Wiggin, L>r. J. T. McLean and
G. L. Birkmaier.
There are upward of 20,000 volumes in
the library. Of these books 5960 are works
of fiction. 3060 are uooks of reference and
IS7O are of tlie juvenile class.
The circulation of the booK" in the
library last year was 108,270. Mr. Har
bourne says: "In 18!)3 the percentage of
fiction reached as higli as 70.8 per cent,
juvenile works 20-9, as against 10.3 per
cent of all other classes, representing the
solid reading matter. For 1894-95 the de
mand for fiction had fallen to 49.4, and
that for solid reading advanced to 31.9."
The following figures are given as show
ing the circulation of books in several
well-known California libraries last year:

THE SAN FRA> T CISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 10, 1896.
MAY REPLIES TO EDOFF
Resents His Attack Upon Pro
hibition and Its
Party.
LIQUOR TRAFFIC DENOUNCED.
Keen Words by a Champion of Tem
perance on the Proposed Measures
of the C. P. A.
Tbo following communication is self
explanatory:
To the. Editor of the Sara Francisco Callâ Deak
Sib: In behalf of your many anti - saloon
readers, I thank you for the liberal space given
me, in reply to Mr. Edoff's recent exhibit of his
California Protective Association.
The Call is true to label: it "speaks for all."
Not only for the vaunting whisky Goliah, with
his hundred millions, but also for the "narrow,
contracted, intolerant, bigoted, selfish and
opinionated" David, with only his despised
little sling.
Mr. Edoff's attempted reply in last Sunday's
Call is manifestly no reply at all. He dodges
tlie mam question entirely and refuses to dis
cuss it in any way. Readmits that itwould be
"absurd" to attempt to defend, the whisky
traffic, when everybody admits that it is wholly
indefensible. There can be nothing said to jus
tify the wholesale destruction which it emails
upon the public, and so, Mr. E., to make a show
of answering, sneers at prohibition and the
Prohibition party. He is afraid to stand up
like a inau and face the terrible indictment
placed against the liquor traflic, which he re
presents.
But why does Mr. E. attack prohibition and
the Prohibition party? There was not the
slightest allusion to either in my letter. The
reason is simply this: The one thing on earth,
in hell, or in heaven, that Mr. E. & Co. do ac
tually fenr is precisely what he affects such a
haughty contempt for, namely, prohibition.
The trurlic always lights it and does its very
worst, in every possible way, to prevent it and
to evade or overthrow it wherever it has be
come the law 01 the laud. For example, right
here in Berkeley there has been a wholesome
State law in force for many years forbidding
the existence of saloons within a mile of the
university grounds.
It is the acknowledged law of the land, and
yet Mr. E.s people have persistently and defi
antly trampled upon it all the time. Who has
furnished these anarchistic criminals with
their liquors all these years? Mr. E. and his
associates have done so, and thus been parti
eeps criminis in lawlessness and rebellion
against the State. The whole truth is, the
liquor traffic is thoroughly selfish, lawless and
despotic. It assumes to dictate to political
parties, to Governors, Legislatures, courts, Su-
pervisors, and even to the federal Government
itself. It thinks itself bigger and stronger
than the State or the United States, and pro
poses to take the government of this country
Into its own hands.
I suppose Mr. K. will turn his nose skyward
when he reads that, and answer it with an
other handful of mid at something or some
body; but the statement is true just the same,
and he and all the rest of the horde of bosses
know it is true.
Why are Mr. E. & Co. so anxious to hnre the
license raised, and so increase their taxes two
or three million dollars? Is that a business
proposition on their part? What otlier busi
ness wants its taxes increased? Not one on
earth. Does the C. P. A. propose this "increase
of revenue" as a donation to the public?
Not one of your readers is foolish enough to
believe it.
The C. P. A. offers this bribe to the public for
good reason.
For the same reason that Collis P. is said to
be so benevolent at times -when the interests
of his octopus are endangered.
And the same reason that the infamous
Louisinna lottery offered millions of money
right and left to any Government that would
tolerate its rascally existence.
That reason is the traffic's own conscious
ness of guiltâ that it has forfeited all right to
exist, and that the American people is awak
ening to the terrible character of this most
deadly enemy that is surely enslaving and
destroying the commonwealth.
Why are Mr. E. <fc Co. so anxious to have the
public think that the traffic is to be "elevated"?
Because they know full well that as it exists
to-day it is perfectly hellish and unendurable.
Why does he want to sound a retreat from
politics? Because as all politicians know,
and the public Is beginning to know, the
liquor traffic is the most notorious and in
famous corrapter of politics ever known.
In Mr. E.s reply he says: "The subject-mat
ter of his communication Is the old threadbare
sermon which has been preached and sung by
the Prohibitionists for a century." Yes, call it
two centuries, as seen by the following from
Sir Matthew Hale, Chief Justice of England in
1070:
"The places Â©f Judicature I have long held
In this Kingdom have given me an opportu
nity to observe the original cause of most of
the enormities that have been committed for
the space of nearly twenty years; and, by due
observation I have found that if the murders
and manslaughters, the burglaries and rob
beries, the riots and tumults, the adulteries,
fornications, rapes and other enormities that
have happened in that time were divided into
five parts, four of them have been the issues
and product of excessive drinking."
Such being the case we can hardly suppose
that the Chief Justice of England was in favor
of Mr. E.s traffic, but was heartily opposed to
it and would prohibit it if he could. His ex
perience and observation are the same as those
of other Judges all along down to our time, as I
showed in my quotation from our Supreme
Court in the former letter.
Archbishop Ireland is a prominent and
highly honored instructor of morals and relig
ion. He also has had a wide observation of
the liquor traffic and has the '-moral courage"
and "mentality" to freely express his opinions
regarding it.
I numbly hope they will prove interesting
and instructive to the C. P. A. He says:
"There is a class of men rebellious to all law.
glorying in their rebellion, defying the people
to curb their powerâ the saloon-keepers. And
this shameless rebellion against law is in or
der to flood the land more freely with alcohol
to make drunkards, ruin families, fill jails and
poorhouses. The organ of the liquor-dealers
pointedly asked the other day why temper
ance speakers attacked .men who are doing
business just as others in the grocery or the
clothing business. The reasons are very plain.
No other business entails woe and sin as the
liquor trade and no other business is lawless
in its methods and defiant before the country
Mrs. Esther A. Lovcjoy, Grand thief of llonor of the Degree of Honor of California
as the liquor traffic. And to secure immunity
in their lawlessness and prevent the enactment
of new laws and a wish on the part of the
country to enforce any, the saloon-keepers and
their leaders are at work to control the politics
of the Republic. The charge needs no proof;
but the people need to be awakened to the
meaning of the fact."
Archbishop Ireland well voices the senti
ments of hII our educators, both in our schools
and churches and homes. The saloons are the
dread and the destroyer of them all, us well as
of everything cisc that is of value in life. Mr.
E. <fc Co. offer to increase their bribe of "li
cense revenue" two or three million dollars
for the privilege of fastening more securely
these parasites on the people. Yours respect
fully, O. G. May.

GRAND DEGREE OF HONOR
Annual Session of the Order in
B'nai B'rith Hall Yes
terday.
INTERESTING REPORTS GIVEN.
The Visiting Delegates Are Tendered a
Reception in Laurel Hall in
the Evening.
The Grand Lodge of the Degree of Honor
of California began its fourth annual ses
sion at 10 o'clock yesterday morning in
the Masonic Hall of B'nai B'rith building.
Delegates from all over the State were
present in force and the day was busily
spent.
This is a social organization largely,
though members have the privilege of
insuring to the extent of $1000. There are
at present only forty-seven beneficiary
members in the State, but a stronger in
terest in the beneficiary degree is being
aroused, and the members expect tnat ere
long a majority of those belonging to the
order will take out insurance pol:cies.
The day was taken up with the reports
of officers and members. The officers' and
committees' reports were all written, but
the majority of the others were delivered
verbally. As in the Workmen lodge, there
has been a slight decrease in membership
during the past year, but the ladies are
confident that the causes which led to this
have been removed, and are sanguine of
great advancement for the future.
The grand chief of honor, Mrs. Esther
A. Loyejoy, prefaced her report with the
following remarks:
In the revolving years the day has again ar
rived for tne annual communion of our Grand
Lodge, and I am pleased to greet you at its
fourth occurrence to measure the progress of
the past year and to deliberate upon the pres
ent condition and needs of our jurisdiction. In
performing this duty 1 but continue the les
sons of the past and follow the example of the
teacher whom I have succeeded. While our
membership has somewhat decreased during
the year about to close. I feel conlident that, if
more of the brethren of the parent order will
interest themselves to this branch of the order,
the coming year will see a marked increase.
Brethren, do not forget that in helping us
you help yourselves.
In regard to the beneficiary department of
the order I will state that we are doing very
well, and we must devise some way to encour
age this very important feature. I trust that
this Grand Lodge Will carefully consider this
very important proposition. It is the founda
tion ot the A. O. U. \\\, and why should it not
be of ours ?
The body of the report shows that the
resignations have bÂ°en two; tbat three
lodges have been organized; that six have
surrendered charters; that the grand mas
ter workman had been appointed adviser,
and that committees on laws, finance and
circulars had been appointed as well as
twenty-three district deuuties.
The report of Mrs. F. S. Toland, tne
grand recorder, shows that the members
enrolled January 1, 1895, were 1010, but
that on January 1, 1896, the books showed
just 827 members, a decrease of 183 for the
year. The report further made known
that the number initiated had been 209,
admitted by card 7, suspended 190, rein,
stated 28, expelled 0, withdrawn 45, and
that the number of deaths had been 8.
The grand receiver's report was devoted
solely to financial mutters. The yearly
receipts were $2262 10 anu the disburse
ments $1068 57, leaving a balance of
$1193 53 on hand January 1, 1896. The re
port of the finance committee tallied with
that of the grand receiver.
The initiatory work was exemplified for
the benefit of the delegates by Silver Spray
Lodge No. 3 of this City in a very credit
able manner, and was warmly appreciated
by the visitors.
In the evening the visitor? were enter
tained at Laurel Hall by ihe City lodges,
and a very pleasant evening was spent.
There were speeches, music and other light
forms of entertainment in plenty, and the
guests departed well pleased at the effort
made to make their visit agreeable and in
structive.
To-morrow morning will occur the an
nual election of officers and of delegates to
the Superior Lodge, which meets at Buf
falo in June.
In the afternoon the newly elected offi
cers will be installed, and all unfinished
business will be cleaned up preparatory to
adjournment till next year.
A HURRAH WITH BUCKLEY.
His Followers Caucus in Large
Numbers and Drink Real
Punch. â¢
The Mistake of Jcseph P. Kelly.
Raitey Lands Another Con
vert in the Mint.
The Buckleyites had a fine hurrah at
the Occidental Club last evening.
Christopher A. Buckley, several of
"Buck's business men," many of the
lambs and a number of the captains of the
â¢'push" were there. There were about
150 of them, and they mot in the parlor,
too.
Dr. James I. Stanton came in late, and
so received his usual cheering, for the
Buckleyites love the doctor. Sam New
man and Coadjutor James H. O'Brien sat
next to the King. Joseph Rothschild was
on hand, and so were ex-Senator Dono-
Tan, "Trilby" M. M. Foote, Secretary D.
M. Gavigan ana other shining leaders.
It was a conference of the leading Buck
leyites of all the districts preparatory to
the vigorous ante-State convention cam
paign about to be opened. It was agreed
that a meeting of the general committee
should be held next week at Odd Fellows'
Hall, at which various small chances in
the arrangements for the primary election
should be made. It was also decided to
begin that series of district mass-meetings
within a few days.
Speeches full of wisdom, "true ring"
Jeffersonian Democracy and trust that a
beneficent providence has chosen the
Biu'kleyites for its own were made by
Messrs. Newman. Stanton, Donovan et.
al. M. M. Foote again stormed the very
gates of hell with his fiery eloquence, and
all around, the gladdening speeches
showed that if anybody thinks the Buck
ley faction has left the political ring his
impressions are about to be corrected.
The star speech of the evening was
made by James H. O'Brien, who an
nounced'that a feed was secreted behind
a set of folding doors. The d^ors were
rolled back by Percy Dana and Sam Sam
ple was revealed smiling on the other side
of the cold ham, the dainty sandwiches,
the cabbage salad, the red radishes and
the pickles. The advance guard formed
around a corner of big bowls of red and
yellow punch, jeweled with lemon slices,
and one of the most delightful social
affairs of the season was at once in full
blast.
Joseph P. Kelly was there making his
cnmpaigti for the Democratic nomination
for Congress in the Fifth District. There
is confidence in Kelly's speech and glad
ness in his hand nowadays. All tliat Kelly
wents is that Loud be nominated by the
Republicans and that he be eriven a chance
to beat him. Kelly is with the Buckley
side, which shows his opinion of what
delegation will nominate Congressmen at
Sacramento June 16. Tnere was soniu
talk that his old Democratic rival, James
Denman. would a<;ain look for that Con
gressional nomination, but it is said now
that Denman expects the Junta to make
him Mayor.
Kelly didn't know last niÂ»ht that he had
made any mistakes until Jim O'Brien gave
him the quiet warning between drinks,
"Say, Joe, the boys are sizing up ttiose
tips," referring to the rich velvet cuffs and
collar that adorned bis overcoat. Keliy
will tone himself down to-day.
The McNao-Sullivan people couldn't be
lieve yesterday that John H. Wise had
gone into a deal with the Dairgett-Rainey
people, and they shouted more loudly
man ever that Rainey's goose is cooked in
the Junta organization.
The Rainey-Daggett people grow strone
er day by day. Yesterday Samuel Hayes,
an influential member of tne general com
mittee from the Twenty-eighth District,
was given a job in the mint. Hayes means
a few more votes against the "inside"; the
Raineyites are sure of winning the organi
zation.
DARTMOUTH COLLEGE DINNER.
A Pleasant Aft'nir at the Occidental,
Where Tom Flint Was Toastmaater.
The annual reunion and dinner of the
Dartmouth College Alumni Association of
the Pacific Coast took place last night at
the Occidental Hotel.
There were twenty -four persons in all
present. Thomas Flint, acting Lieuten
ant-Governor, occupied the sent at the
head of the table and officiated a<* toast- |
master. Among those present were: Fisher
Ames, Ira G. Hoitt. T. A. Perkins, C. S. i
\V right and Sidney Worth.
There were many speeches, in which j
not only early college days, but the rigor
ous experiences of afterlife were discussed.
A number of old-time college songs were
also rang. The dinner was in every way
most enjoyable.

Dr. Sanden's Theory â¢ e te f
ing that "Electricity, Is Life" is no less true to-day than when
first used ; in fact, all physicians and men of science contend
that we could not exist without a certain amount of electric force
in our bodies.
The theory is that we would be so lacking in the vital ele-
ment that there would not be energy sufficient in the nerves to
sustain life and supply the demands of nature.
v. It is well understood by every man that each mental, physi-
cal or vital action uses up a certain amount of this vital force-
electricity. It therefore frequently occurs that by excesses or
dissipation in work, study or pleasure, the vitality is exhausted
This vitality is Electricity, which Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt
will replace. This appliance slowly fills the body with electric
energy every night while you sleep, and in a few weeks it builds
up the vital force to the most vigorous standard.

PREPARING THE PRIMARY
Meeting of the Republican County
Committee Last
Evening
TO NAME ELECTION OFFICERS.
The Lists Will Be Handed in To-
Night by the Ccmmitteemen
Themselves.
The Republican County Committee held
a harmonious meeting in Scottish Hall last
night, the purpose being to prepare for the
I primaries.
Chairman Charles Manwaring requested
i the members from the Fourth District 10
; hanci in the names of their appointees as
! election officers to the chaiiman of that
! district, the members from the Fifth to
I hand in the same to the chairman of the
j Fifth. He announced that the time for
I holding the primaries had been fixed at 1
| p. M. to 7 p. m.
.1 sse Marks desired to be informed
! whether the rights of the committeernen
1 in selecting t lie election officers would be
j respected by the committee.
Mr. Watt and Mr. Thompson wanted the
County comniitteemen from the Fourth.
and Fifth districts to meet in separate
district committees to receive the names
| of the appointees for officers for the pri
; mary election.
Chairman Manwaring explained that
' the names which each rommitteeman was
I to hand to tne chairman of his district
would be accepted.
This gave general satisfaction, and the
meeting resolved isself into two conven
tions. Tiiat from the Fourth Congres-
â  sional District, decided' to meet this even
: ing at 8 o'clock at 850 Market street for
' the purpose of receiving the names of
election officers.
In the meeting of the Fifth Congres
sional District, Committeeman Berliner
asked whether every County committee
man would not be allowed to name his
officers and John M. Chretien in the chair
explained that it was simply a matter of
general courtesy to have a talk about the
names in the committee of the whole. For
instance, if some committeeman, in a
moment of thoughtlessness, recommended
a Democrat the mistake could be discov
ered and rectified by the member submit
ting some other name inotead.
It was agreed that each member should
hand in his list to-night at 8 o'clock to
Chairman Chretien or Secretary Walsh at
850 Market street, togetiier with the pre
cinct boundaries and all other pertinent
information.
Comniitteemen Houston, Bacigalupi and
Browning were appointed a committee oa
printingr.
On motion of Houston, seconded by Pen
dergast and Berliner, the committeemen
were authorized to fill any vacancies on
the tickets that might occur prior to the
election.
The meeting then adjourned.MR. PILLSBURY
HAS FINISHED
Only Three More Speakers
to Follow With Some
Arguments.
HAYNE THIS MORNING.
Conclusiveness of the Rates Not
a Bar to an Inquiry Into
Reasonableness.
PART OF THE LAW IS VOID.
It Is the Province of the Courts to
Stand Between the Railroads and
the Commission.
The endless chain cf argument in the
id Commission case was resumed
before Judge McKenna in the United
states Circuit Court yesterday morning.
A GROUP OF URCHINS FROM THE NORTH BEACH DISTRICT.
{From photographs at tlie Youth's Directory.]
Mr. Pillsbury, refreshed by a night of
sweet repose, proceeded on his way of
words and addressed himself sometimes
to the court and more often to Mr.
Hayne, who acted as the picador of the
legal bull-right, jabbing into the baited
animal questions rather in the nature ot
satirical comments upon the railroad side
of the controversy,2than inquiries for in
formation.
Mr. I'illsbury died gamely in the ring
at 3:15 p. m. and the spectators were dis
missed. This morning Mr. Hayne, with
fire in his eye and snorting defiance at the
locomotive, will paw up tho arena and
lower his head for the battle shock.
Mr. I'ilisbury handled millions again
yesterday afternoon. He argued that
taking the Attorney-General's method of
presenting the question the excess of gross
earnings of the road over operating ex
penses. Including additions, improvements
and betterments, was $9,274,509 33 in 1895,
and (10,558,873 77 in 1894, a decrease of
$1,311,:^; 54.
Leaving those millions to rest and draw
interest for a while the speaker turned to
the consideration of the constitutionality
of the California law. He cited the Minne
sota statute, which had been held invalid
and void because it provided tor rates
which should be conclusive. The Cali
fornia law expressly provides for conclu
sive rates everywhere. If, under the
Minnesota statute, the Board of Railway
Commissioners could establish only con
rluÃivr rates the same would oe the case
under the California statute.
pose tnat the Board of Railroad
Commissioners of this State had added a
proviso when establishing the 2-3 percent
redaction to the effect that the question of
the reasonableness of this 25 per cent
reduction might be inquired into by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such a
i would be of no force or effect
because it wouid not be within the scope
ol their power, their constitutional
rity being to fix conclusive rates and
none other. Even if the rates were fair
and reasonable their conclusive character
would not be changed by that presump
tion.
The Minnesota statute was declared in
valid â  â¢ cu.^u it made do provision for
ascertaining the reason auk-ness of the
mte- declaring that they were con
clusive. In the California constitution
there is do provision for determining the
tairness of the rates fixed by the Railroad
Commissioners.
"If the conclusive provision in the con
stitution ia valid what business have we
h^re in court Inquiring into the reason
ableness of the rpductio'i?" asked Mr.
lMl*bury. "The only thing to do is to
fliminaic it."
The case of Pollock against the Farmers'
Loan ami Trust Company was cite! to
show that Chief Justice Brewer bad re
ferred to the debates in the constitutional
convention, and aiso to the arguments ad
dreEÃed to the legislatures of the several
States, in order that he mifrht determine
precisely what was meant by direct taxa
tion.
Judtre McKenna remarked that the Cali
fornia constitutional convention commit
tee reported the amendment without the
conclusive character, that having been
added by an amendment after the com
mittee bad reported. The court added
that Mr. Herrin had contended in hh
argument that no commission would have
been appointed by the constitutional con
vention unless the rates to be fixed by the
commission would be deemed conclusive.
'â¢The constitution itself shows sufficiently
without the aid of the debates that the
rate 3 were intended to be conclusive."
Mr. Pillebury concluded his argument
with the hope that the court would grant
an injunction against the Railroad Com
missioners until the question of the rea
â¢sonablenes should have been determined
by the courts.
Mr. Hayne will begin his argument on
benali of the people tins morning.
TO PRISON TOR LIFE.
Nicholas Claussen Found Guilty and
His Punishment Limited by
the Jury.
Nicholas Claussen has escaped with his
life, but he must spend the remainder of it
behind prison bars. The jury returned a
verdict yesterday morning, after being out
from half-past 3 o'clock 0:1 Wednesday.
Claussen had murdered his wife â a cold
blooded murder, done in the presence of his
little .sun, ami done, as he himself after
ward said, for fun. The evidence at the
trial showed that Ciaussen and his wife
had had a quarrel and that right after
ward Claussen left the lionise and went to
a pawnshop on Fourth street, where he
asked for a pistol. One was shown to him,
and, after beating down the price to $2 50,
he took the pistol and asked the clerk to
show him how to load it. The clerk did
so, ana gave him some cartridges, and,
taking the pistol. Clanssen returned home,
lie found his wife lying on the bed and,
without speaking, he shot her three times.
The first ballot taken showed four jurors
in favor of hanging, live for life imprison
ment, two for murder in the second degree
and one for manslaughter. The jurymen
were: Henry Schussler, Charles A. Slack,
John Walls, Frank Frisbie, C. F. Behr
nian, Joseph I. Twohig, C. M. Foster,
Horace B. Angell, A. T. Dunbar, H. Taber,
Herman VVesterfeld, F. H. Kessler. There
were live Germans among ttu*m.
FIFFY THOUSAND SURPLUS
Masons Differ as to How the
Money Should Be Ex
pended.
The Cemetery Managers Have the
Funis and the Relief Board
Wants Possession.
The Masonic Cemetery Association has
550,000 surplus on hand, and the different
lodges of the order in San Francisco have
asked to have it dispensed through the
regular channel for charitable purposes.
This the cemetery managers refuses to
i do and the order has appointed a com
mittee to confer with them and decide on
; some course satisfactory to all. The board
< of relief is hard pressed for ready cash and
' consequently is making a hard iiuht for the
possession of the monty in question, as the
draw upon the charitable fund is large and
, pressing.
The Oriental Lodge was the iir3t to mate
: a move in the premises. It is claimed that
I under a law passed by the State Legisla
j ture some years ago the Cemetery As-ocia
( tion, since the Masonic order controls its
own cemetery, is obliged to turn over any
turplus money derived from the Bale and
j care of burial lots, after the actual expenses
I of the cemetery have been paid, for toe
| purposes of relief.
Chairman Davis of the board of trustees
â¢ of the Cemetery Association says that the
: surplus now 0:1 hand will be needed in
: making proposed extensions to the cerne
\ tery, and should the money be expended
; in other directions it would be impossible
I to begin the work at all.
Chairman Countryman and others of the
special committee appointed by the differ
'-. C!it lodges feel that the matter will be
. amicably adjusted without appeals to the
courts.
Y. M. U. A. Debatiug Society.
The advocates of tho "single tax" will have
to look well to their laurels to-morrow night.
The Literary and Debating Society of the
Y. M. C. A. is to discuss the subject, "Is prop

esting and instructive. It is reported that

sented.

Gustave R. E. Braunschweiger was convicted
in the United Slates District Court yesterday
j of extracting a money order from a letter and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 10, 1896.
A CHARITY AT HOME
Noble Work Being Done at the
Youths' Directory in the
Mission.
TALENT FOUND IN THE GUTTER
Monsignor Nugent's Seeds Are Show
ing an Abundant Harvest All Over
the World.
The visit to this City of Monsignor
Nugent, the genial, kindly old man who
has devoted a lifetime to alleviating the
hard conditions surrounding the waifs of
great cities all over the wide world and to
a successful study of the most diflicult
child problem, or, in other words, the
fashioning of useful men from material in
the gutter, revives interest in the good
work in this same line which is being
carried on by the Rev. Father Crowley at
the Youths' Directory on Howard street.
This charitable institution is but the
first of the seeds sown long ago by Mon
signor Nugent in Liverpool.
This eminent churchman will deliver on
next Sunday evening, at Metropolitan
Temple, a lecture entitled "'Monsignor
Nugent's Story: The Waifs and Strays, or
Pictures of Street Life in England." Ex
ceedingly few men possess as much prac-

\From photograph at the Youth's Directory.]
tical experience with destitute and home
less children as he, and for this reason and
the vast amount of real good he has been
instrumental in doing his remarks will be
interesting and instructive.
The Youths' Directory, under the di
rectorship of Father Crowley, is conducted
according to the lines first laid down by
Monsienor Nugent. Since March 1, 1895,
the institution has offered shelter to 461
children, many of whom were sent by
parents and relatives, a large number by
members of St. Joseph's Union and several
)y the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
o Children. The following table shows
the number entered upon the books and
how the children have been disposed of:
March 1. 1595, in Directory 58
Beceived March l-June 1, 1895 83
Received June Iâ September 1,1895 94
Received September Iâ Deccember 1, 1895 99
Received December 1. 1Â»95-March 1, 1896.... 1 27
Total 461
They were disposed of as follows:
To St. Vincent's A3.vlnin 132
To JSt. Joseph's Asylum 66
To guardians 158
To places in families 36
To Girls' Directory 16
To hospital 1
Left, without permission 5
Total. 414
A glance at the first division of the list
will show that tne work has widened
month by month. The accommodations
of the house will not allow of lodging more
than seventy-live at once.
Ten years ago the present site was pur
chased and the present structure wasbuiit.
Since that time the institution has under
gone many vicissitudrs, but by generous
donations ha 3 always succeeded in sur
mounting its difficulties. Neither the
State nor the County has ever granted the
slightest appropriation, and the institution
is maintained solely by voluntary offer
ings.
Father Crowley, speaking of the work
done, said yesterday: "We take children
of all nationalities and creeds. The little
street arabs can always find a hospitable
home open here to receive them, where
their temporary wants will be supplied
and assistance in procuring permanent
homes or employment rendered them.
"We believe here that prevention and
protection from evil ways are far more
valuable than remedy after the child has
grown to be a man habituated to wrong
doing. This is the cheapest method and
the best.
â¢ : We also beliove that our duty of charity
lies at home as well as abroad, and here in
this City, where 16,000 children are run
ning about the streets, shooting craps and
smoking cigarettes, we rind a wide field
for usefulness.
"We have some trouble with the little
fellows at first. We have to watch them
to prevent their running away, but after a
few days they acquire a liking for the
place and soon begin to consider it their
Dome. We send them to the public
schools, and their teachers give always
good reports of them, saying they are, as
a rule, bright, intelligent boys and easily
governed. Here our government is al
most perfect. We exercise mildness and
firmness, and only in the most obstinate
cases do we resort to corporal punishment.
"Dunne my connection with the institu
tion we have turned out 4200 boys, and out
of this number only four have proved in
corrigible. Monsignor Nugent himself
says he has found much talent in the
gutter, and many of my boys hold re
sponsible positions to-day. Much more
can be done with abandoned boys than
people think; they simply need to be
handled rightly."
The interior of the building shows that
the wants of the boys are very comfortably
provided for indeed. There are reading
rooms, billiard-rooms and libraries. The
dining-room and the dormitories are cozy
and n-.-at. The rooms are all well lighted
and aired. A good-sized chapel is on the
second floor.
A lecture is given three times a week,
generally illustrated witn stereopticon
views. "Behind the building there is a
large, sunny playground.
RAILROAD OFFICERS.
The Results of tlie Klection Sot Ex
actly as Was Generally
Expected.
At the meeting of the newly elected di
rectors of the Southern Pacific Company
yesterday the following officers were
elected for the ensuing year: President,
C. P. Huntington; first vice-president, C.
F. Crocker; second vice-president, T. H.
Hubbard; third vice-president, J. C.
Stubbs; treasurer, N. T. Smith; secre
tary and assistant controller, E. C. Wright;
controller, William Mahl; assistant secre
taries, C. F. Krets and J. K. Gates.
Considerable surprise was created among
many of the railroad people by the election
of Mr. Hubbard to be second vicje-president,
as it was the cener.il idt-a that Mr. Stubbs
would be advanced to that office. The
fact that Mr. Hubbard has accepted
the position of second vice-president in
stead of remainine simply a director as
heretofore is believed to presage a more
active interest in the affairs of the corpor
ation, and the advocacy of a policy that
will tend less to antagonize the public than
that hitherto pursued.
The disposition of the offices held by the
late G. L. Lansingâ those of controller and
secretaryâ was also unexpected. It was
believed that Mr. Klink, one of the princi
pal clerks under Mr. Lansing, wouid fall in
for promotion. E. C. Wright, the new
secretary, was formerly general auditor,
and "William Mahl, now controller, was
previously second assistant to the presi
dent. The vacancy made by Mr. Mahl's
promotion w Jl probably be tilled by some
one of Mr. Mahl's former assistants in the
New York office. The president has the
appointment of his assistants.
Work on the annual report of the S >uth
ern Pacific Company has been delayed by
the non-receipt of certain data from New
York, which left that city to-day. It is
not expected to have the report ready for
at least a week.
Great activity continues to prevail in
Portsmouth dockyard, where upward of
1000 men are working overtime.

MURRAY THE TRAIN AGENT
He Was an Expert in Signa
tures and Hand
writing.
SOME INTERESTING EVIDENCE.
Cbirography Which Passed a Bank
Tel'er Was Refused on
the Train.
The plaintiff's side of the Martin case is
all in, and it rests now with the railroad
to explain why it was that a good ticket
was confiscated because a train agent
thought it was "scalped."
This same train agent was named Mur
ray. He was on the stand during the day
to tell how it was he detected a difference
between the signature George Martin put
on his ticket and the one he wrote after
ward for the train agent. The first was
Signed at a ticket window, the second was
written on a moving train, and when
Murray, the train agent, compared the
two lie thought he found a difference and
took up the ticket.
Under Delmas' cross-examination Mur
ray said he was on the run from Sacra
mento east. He saw Martin on the train
and took a look at his ticket. He de
manded a signature, a sort of sample, and
when it was written at the rate of thirty
miles an hour he found a difference. He
demanded another signature soon after
and then demanded further identification.
He was shown Martin' 3 business card and
the name on his valise, but he wanted to
see drafts and checks, and when these
were not forthcoming he took the ticket up.
He was shown a signature on a draftâ one
which had been honored by a bankâ and
he said it was Martin's. It was similar to
the one that had been made for the train
asent and this was acknowledeed, but
what the bank had accepted for several
hundreds of dollars the train agent had
refused for the last fraction of a return
ticket becanse he thought the defendant's
sicnatures did not look just alike.
Mr. Del mas then inquired into Murray's
qualifications as a writing expert â as a
comparer of valuable signatures. He
found that Murray had been train agert
for a year. A train agent is a man who
can see a scalped ticket through a two
foot brick wall and who can reach for it
even after it has left the Southern Pacific
lines. He was promoted to this position
of train agent for five years' successful
service as v conductor. The conductor's
hat was worn after years' of service twist
ing a brake wheel. He fitted himself for
a brakeman'a position by Berving at the
plow for eleven years. He was a farmer
then, ne said, and through all these po
sitions he had been studying handwriting
to qualify himself for the position of train
agent â to make him a better judge of
signatures than a bank cashier.
During his year as a train agent Mr.
Murray said he had taken up 170 tickets.
He had made three errors; Martin's ticket
was one, and then two others. General
Barnes then asked how many of the re
maining 167 were stolen ana how many
were scalped, but Mr. Delmas didn't see
the relevancy of such testimony, and he
said so. Then there was a long argument
on the point, which ended in a ruling of
the court that the questions were inad
missible. During the argument General
Barnes reiterated the claim of the railroad
that the test signature had been purposely
miswritten, and Mr. Delmas took occasion
to remark that if such a state of things
could be proven he would at once drop the
case.
John J. "SViegeliner of the California
"Wine Association testified that he had
sold a carload of wine to Mr. Martin on
credit, and that he had looked up Mr.
Martin before doing so. He found his
character good, and his draft for the wine
was honored when presented.
11. C. Hubbard, the train agent for the
run between Oakland and Sacramento,
testified that he asked Martin to write his
name, but the signature thus secured was
not satisfactory. It was not produced in
court, however. He then had asked Mar
tin for a second signature, and this proved
more satisfactory. This was submitted as
evidence. Mr. Delmas wanted to see the
unsatisfactory one, as he was fully con
vinced ii was like the one on the draft, but
the railroad people had lost the signature.
The case went over until next Monday,
after the arguments by counsel had been
concluded.
SLAVERY IN CHINATOWN.
A Young Girl Brought From
Portland and Offered
for Sale.
She Was Rescued and Is Now an In
mate cf the Presbyterian
Mission Home.
The fact that slavery is practiced among
the Chinese in this City has been fre
quently commented upon and a further
illustration has just come to light.
On March 28 Yen King, a comely Chi
nese woman, 22 years of age, arrived here
from Portland, Or., accompanied by Sic
Ging and Sic Pack, two hi hbinders. They
offered her for sale in Chinatown and the
female keeper of a house of ill-fame had
agreed to purchase her for $500. The price
was so cheap that she became suspicious,
and thinking there was something crooked
about the transaction she refused to curry
out tht> agreement.
Yen King's cousinÃ on Wednesday ob
tained a warrant for her arrest on the
charpe of vagrancy, so as to get her out of
tbe hands of the two highbinders, and
t at night she was taken to the California
street police station.
She was released on bail and was taken
to the Presbyterian Chinese Mission Home
on Sacramento street. Yesterday morn
ing, accompanied by Miss Culbertson,
Yen King appeared before Judge Low.
Her cousins and ex-Judge Lawier, their
attorney, were also present in court. After
hearing the facts in the case the Judtre
dismissed the charge of vagrancy, and Yen
King was taken back to the Presbyterian
Mission Home, where she now is.
A warrant was immediately sworn out
before Judge Low for the arrest of Sic
Ging and Sick Puck, the two highbinders,
on the charge of kidnaping Yen King,
under section 784 of the Penal Code.
About a week ago ex-Judge Lawier was
the means of rescuing the wife of a Chi
nese merchant from a life of slavery.
She had been kidnaped and traced
to Courtland, where she was found in a
horrible condition. Her abductors, upon
finding that she was discovered, slashed
her face so as to disfigure her for life if
possible. She is now living again with
her husband in Chinatown.

NKW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, X. V., April 9âStocks were in
tensely dull to-day, the total sales amounting to
only 183,926 shares. The opening of the market
was firm, the sensational rumors of yeiterday about
the President's action in the Cuban matter having
failed to materialize. Irisi <-s moved up fractional! v,
but the improvement did not brine in orders from
outsiders, and as of late business was monopolized
by the trading element. London gold a little St.
Paul and Louisville and Nashville.
In the afternoon the market showed a weaker
tendency on reports of further gold shipments late
in the week and the revival of the report that
President Cleveland will send a message to Con
press indorsing the recent action of that body on
the Cuban matter, Leading bear operators with
\\ ashington connections were conspicuous sellers
of the Grangers at this time. The rumors re
ferred to, however, could not be traced to any
authentic source. The loss in the Grangers was
insigniticant. hut >ii(.-.ir was decidedly weaker and
fell from IIBV2 '" 116%, with a subsequent re
rovpry to 117Vg. Tobacco declined from H45.g to
83Vi. and later recovered to 8434- The death of
Vic -President Poor was used against the stock
early 111 the day.
The decline In the general list in the afternoon
dealings was equal to i/i and 1 per cent, the
Grangers, General Electric and ttnbber leading

CHICAGO MAKKETS.
CHICAGO, li,t.. April The trade in wheat
to-day by its limited proportions gave evidence of
the approach of the Government report which will
be issued to-morrow. Neither the bulls, who pro
fessed faith In a low condition, nor the bears, who
fell confident that wheat, was in excellent shape,
barring a few exceptions, were disposed to assume
any risk on their theories. To-day's rains and
showers, which were generally over the winter
wheat belt, checked an early rise in prices and the
dullness of business prevented radical fluctuations
later. The Cincinnati Price Current gave a bull
ish summary on the condition of winter wheat for
â¢lie past week, the effect of which was to tempt
the less conservative to do some buying, but offer-
Ings rather overwhelmed the demand and reces
sions naturally followed.
Receipts at Chicago were 15 oars, and the North
west had 229. Local inspections from store were
137,158 bushels. Liverpool cables were quiet and
steady. Within the last hour the selling became
more pronounced and decided weakness devel
oped, prices coinK to the lowest point for the ses
sion at that time. Export clearances were light at
194,170 bushels. Closing Berlin and Paris cables
were lower. Antwerp was higher. -May wheat
opened from 66%@66%c, sold between 86% and
65V ; >@65f;gc, closing at 64%@65%C, MlÂ® s6Â° un
der yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow
â¢JO cars.
CORNâ lnactivity was the leading feature of
corn to-day. The news furnished nothing tending
to deflect prices in either direction, and traders
based their dealings oil the ruling strength or
weakness of wheat. Receipts wen; 220 cars, and
146.5"J9 bushels were withdrawn lrom store. Liv
erpool cables were quiet and VÂ±A lower. Export
clearances amounted to l^S.Hil bushels. -May
corn opened at 3U%c, sold between SOc and 30* 6 q)
301,4 c closing at 80c, %fee under yesterday. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow 210 cars.
OATSâ Were influenced by wheat opening firm
and later showing leas strength. The rains re
ported in all sections are of great value to the
seeding of oats and consequently tend to weaken
the feeling in the market. -Receipts were 197 cars.
There were no withdrawals from store. May
closed a shade under yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow 125 cars.
FLAXâ Was easy. Cash, 90y 2 (Â£9lc: May, 89Â®
90c; September, 93iA@5Hc. Receipts were eight
cars.
PROVISIONSâ Product was but moderately ac
tive to-duy with a fairly steady to tnir tone pre
vailinir. interest in this market is just, now di
verted by the superior attractions of wheat, and
prices are in a measure Influenced by that grain.
The hog market was firm to-day, that helping the
tone of product e*rly, but the weakness of wheat
pave an easy tone later and the close was gener
ally lower. ".May pork closed 7' c under yester
day, May lard 1 ->ia.sc lower and .May ribs a shade
lower.

Ueorge K. Hogg, mining expert in the employ of
the Gold Mining Exchange, has been upending
some days In West Point, Calaveras County, ex
amining the Loekwood Con. (ioid Mining Com
pany's claims. It is expected that the property
will be listed on the exchange if the expert re
ports favorably.
Intil a short time ago the Lockwood was a divi
dend-payer for months. Quite a large body of ore
has been developed lately, and upon the erection
of chlorination works, which are in contemplation,
dividends may be again resumed. Ihe property Is
fully equipped with hoisting works, buildings,
mill, etc.
West Point, though but little known, contains
some of the best mines in the State, such as the
Blazing Stur. Klverside, Hurley mine. Scorpion,
Manachee, >oap 1-too: and Kelsey. The ore of the
district is high-grade sulphuretted ore.
At a special meeting of the Â«.>old Mining Ex
change the membership was extended to sixty,
which will admit ten more members at $'250
The usual quarterly dividend of 81 50 per share
will be paid by the Nevada Bank on the 15ih.
The ore output of the :~egrrgated Belcher mine
for the past week was 17 mining carloads, the
average top car sample assay of which was $22 21
per ton.
In the Confidence mine prospecting from the
end of the north drift, 60 fert above the surface
tunnel, is still going on. There was extracted dur
ing the past week and stored in the orehouse at the
mine six mining carloads of ore, the average top
sample assay of which assayed $'26 77.
In the Overman mine the usual prospecting work
is being dou<\ For the past week 5 tons of ore, as-
Raying $15 per ton, was extracted from the north
drift on the 900 level.
The joint Confidence, Challenge and Imperial
west crosscut 1 from the surface tunnel is out 479
feet. The face is in porphyry.
In the Crown Point mine they have started a
raise from the south drift on the 700 level and are
up one set of timbers. The top Is ail in quartz as
saying from $3 to $4 per ton. There is no change
in the oilier workings of the mine.
The yield of the belcher mine for the past week
was twenty-one mining-car loads of ore, the aver
age top car sample assay of which was *19 36 per
ton. They shipped to the Brunswick mill for re
duction 336 ions and 1360 pounds of accumulated
ore, the average battery sample of which, so far as
worked, is $23 per ton. The bullion returns will
be received next week.
In the Savage mine the usual prospecting work
is being done on the 850 and 950 levels, and
streaks and bunches of fair-grade ore are being en
countered. During the past week they hoisted 36

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.l
908 Broadway, April 9. \
Individual communk>n-cu;>s will be
used at the sÂ«cratnent of the Market-street
Congregational Church next Sunday for
the first time. Nothing was known by me
congregation of the proposed change till
the pastor, Rev. Dr. Chapman, announced
last vii^rht at the prayer-meeting that he
bad, with the consent of the trustees, pro
. the necessary paraphernalia and
I inaugurate the innovation next
Su: day.
â¢lour years ago," said Dr. Chapman,
â¢I became convinced of the necessity,
from a hygienic point of view, of mdi
': cups, and 1 decided that whenever
1 had charge of a church I would at once
commence the new method. I spoke to
several parties about the change, and they
all agreed that the thing should be done,
but so many churches are supplied with
expensive communion services that they
objected to making the change.
"ThiÂ« is a new church and I decided to
put my ideas into practice. I coneulted
with the trustt-esand they agreed with me,
and we at unce sent for the necessary ser
vice. Since the church opened we have
been using the old cups that we borrowed,
and 1 did not like them. We thought we
were able to procure a set of cups for our
seives, and we decided to have a healthy
-et. I have not said one word against the
oKI system, because I concluded that it
â was a subject that couid not be touched
upon until everything was ready for the
chance. Once exploited, the objections to
the old style are so definite that I cannot
conceive how anybody would use them
Again.
"At the prayer- meeting last night I told
the congregation what I had done and to
my great joy everybody accepted the
Change with marked express. ons of ap-
I Lave not heard one single word
â  test apainst the change and 1 do not
believe I ever shall.
â  1 "he arrangement for administering the
facranieiu is very simple. All the little
.â re in the racks with a sip of the wine
in each. The rack is passed along just the
same as a collertion p^ate and each com
municant takes one. When all are served
itie prayer is -aiil and the congregation
take tne sacrament simultaneously.
"In front of every ciiair there is a little
ting. ;nto whiHi the empty cups are put.
the janitor gathers up the
hem and replares them in
the rack. A very simple syphon arrange
ir.r:;t regulates the amount put into each
cup and can be worked very speedily. By
a little pressure on a button covers fall
over t â¢ tiers â â >; glumes mid prevent all
particles of dust from polluting the wine.
By using four racks the wine can be dis
tributed very quickly and the whole ser
â  ice can be conducted with dignity and
quietness. There is really no objection to
the new system that 1 can think of."

OAKLAND. Cal., April 9.â Herman
(.ck, the eldest son of Rev. Mr.

c was shot through the hand by one

AN EX-MARSHAL'S TROUBLES.
Saloon-Keeper Koch Charges Him With
Stealing Dig Own Gun.
PLEASANTON, Cal., April 9.âEx-Mar
shal Donally was triea here yesterday on
the charge of stealing his own revolver,
and acquitted. The complaining witness
was J. Koch, a saloon-keeper.
It seems Donally left his revolver in
Koch's bar with the intention of raffling it
on July 1, 1895. He owed Koch $8 50 for
liquor furnished over the bar and about
.SIOO house rent. Sunday he went to the
saloon and took the guv, as it had not
been raffled. Monday Koch had him ar
rested. At the trial Koch swore he had
at Donaliy s request allowed him credit
for the value of the gtm on his drink ac
count. Donally showed this had been done
after his arrest. He now threatens to sue
Koch for false arrest.
A SHAKY CHIMNEY.
County Officials and Attorneys Fear a
Great Calamity.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 9.â The totter
ing chimney which has been a menance at
the County Courthouse for more than two
years, swayed back and forth in the breeze
to-day in a manner that terrorized all who
had business under the shadow of the im
pending calamity. They are apprehensive
of having several tons of brick and mortar
tumble upon them at any moment, and
the prospect is not a particularly pleasant
one.
On every windy day the cracks open and
close with the gusts of wind in an ominous
manner. The Supervisors had stay rods
attached to the top and bound the broken
place with iron hoops, but these would
snap like thread if the chimney should
topple over. The Supervisors are taking
a big risk in allowing the. chimney to re
main, as the county would undoubtedly be
mulcted for heavy damages in case it fell
and killed one or more persons.

Burned by Oil.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 9.â VV. H.
\Vr;ght is seeking to recover from the Pa
cifio Coast Oil Company the sum of $25u0
as damages for injuries, which he alleges i
were received in November last at the com- j
pany's works at Alameda Point. Plaintiff j
â  was a stillman, his duties being to take
; care of the stills in the refinery. He al- !
I leges that one particular vat was" defective
|in the bottom, being cracked. With the
application of the heat from the tire the
crack widened and the vat collapsing a
stream of boiling oil ran out and taking
fire burned him about the hands, face and j
body. As a result of the injuries re
ceived he was confined to his bed for five
weeks, and he alleges that besides the loss of
time his health was so injured that it will
take a long time to recover.
Another Electric-Car Accident.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 9.â Charles A.
Taylor, driver for Dr. Reynolds, met with
a bad accident last evening. Dr. Reynolds
had just alighted to see a patient at 2029
Santa Clara avenue, and Tavlor was turn
ing around and to do that had to cross the
electric-car track. One car that was com
ing he allowed to get past and then at
tempted to turn, not knowing that there
i was another immediately behind, which
was an unusual thing. The car struck the
buggy and threw the driver out, breaking
his leg. The horses were not injured, hut
the vehicle was badly used up.
How the 31 rm f y Goes.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 9.â The city of j
Alameda pays in salaries every month the I
sum of $9933 55. Of this $6165 goes to the |
School Department. The expense of the j
city government for the months of Janu
ary, February and March was $60,960 66,
but this was something more than the
average because of the payment of interest j
principal on bonds and rinal payment on
the new City Hall.
Kffey Can't Come.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 9.â Word has
been received by the secretary of the Mu
nicipal Ownership League to the effect that
Mayor Effey, who was booked to address
the league to-morrow night, on municipal
ownership of water and lighting plants,
will be unable to keep his engagement.
The other features of the programme will
be carried out, however.
Street Suit.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 9.â Friday is
the day set for the trial of the City of Ala
meda vs. the Perata Bros. The city sought i
to take a strip of land, sixty feet wide and
511 feet lone, to permit of the extension of
Buena Vista avenue. It fixed the value of
this strip at the rate of $2150, it being less |
than an acre. The owners refused to ac
cept the price and suit was therefore
brought to coDdenia the land. The
owners want $4000.
J. B. Darnell of Odessa, Ky., is 61 years

weather permits, with an iron wedge that
is over 200 years old, which hie great-grand
father brought from Scotland with him.
He hauls the rails with his mule, Katy,
which is 34 years old; he shaves once a

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 10, 1896.
CO-OPERATION IS
A BIG SUCCESS.
Result of One Year's Colo
nial .Work on Winters
Island.
A PERIOD OF PROGRESS.
â 
One of the Few Spots in California
Free From the Southern
Facific.
NOT WITHOUT SOME TRIALS.
B fore Another Year Passes It Is Ex
pected the Colony Wi'l Pro
duce an Income.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,(
90S Broadway, April 9. f
The annual meeting of the Winter's
Island Co-operative Society was held at
Major Howe's em'ce on San Pablo avenue
last night &nd the various reports made
show that the colony on the island is pros
pering in excess of what its promoters
anticipated.
A. .1. Gregg, president of the society,
came from Winters Island to attend the
annual meeting and his account of the
progress of events in the little common
wealth was very interesting and shows
what can be done when a system is carried
out on well-organized principles. The
society only permits of a membership of
one hundred and at the present time there
are eighty-seven stockholders, so that there
is not much opportunity for outsiders to
join.
Edwin G. Paine who, with his wife, has
only been on tne island for six weeks, sent
a communication, in which he said: "I
came to California to lind a horn' 1 . Prices
are higher tnan I expected. I investigated
many propositions and finally took up
with Winters Island. I took a month to
investigate, and when the January high
water occurred and I saw that the possi
bility of danger from floods was so small I
made up my mind. With risks no greater
than in any othÂ»r farming operations, and
with co-operative ineihods and perfect in
dependence of the Southern and Central
Pacific railroads, it seems reasonable to
expect profit. The profit cannot be imme
diate, but one accustomed to working for
future results and familiar with tne profits
from good soil, even by the poor farming
methods common to all new countries, can
satisfy himself that here is an investment
that will produce a living, at least, and
will also stand a comparison with life in
surance."
The co-operative principle is rigidly ad
hered to and building and planting are be
ing carried on at a lively rate. Members
can pay the assessments on their stock
with anything that a human community
can use. (Since its inception the brother
hood has accepted the personal r.otes of
members for snares, but this system has
been abandored, and now that the colone
ls on a solid footing financially the terms
of the existing agreement are being strictly
followed.
Since President Gregg went to live on the
island progress has oeen very marked.
Acres of asparagus and berries are being
sown. Very little mo*e money will have
to be put into tools. What is paid now on
assessments will be put into permanent
improvements and crops. The permanent
improvements are buildings and the ex
tension of the levee.
There have been many hardships en
dured by the pioneers of "Winters Island.
For over a year there was not a cow on the
island.
"We shall celebrate the 25th of March,"
said the president, "because on that day
of the month there was landed at our dock
a small black-and-white speckled cow. It
is one of the most useful members of the
colony. It is constantly urged that this
enterprise is not based on sentiment, but
on strictly business principles. Withal,
one can't avoid a little sentiment. The
feeling of security and rest produced by
the thought that one can soon have a
place where ho can be assured of constant,
healthy and agreeable employment, where
he will not have to go out and beg for the
privilege of workingâ where he will know
that he is to get the full produc; of his
labor â all this may be sentimental, but it
is very satisiactory and comforting."
The following officers were elected for
the ensuine year: A. J. Gregg, president;
Major W. O. Howe, vice-president; F. D.
Hopkins, secretary; E. Kelsey, treasurer;
E. Hough, director.
STUDENTS' EASTERN TOUR
A Good Portion of the Money
Needed for the Trip Already
Subscribed.
The Cc-Eds Assist the AthletesâMeet
ing of the Philosoph cal Union
of the University.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 9.â The Asso
ciated Students of the State University
met to-day at 1 o'clock, and within thirty
minutes subscribed $t}oo toward the pro
posed Eastern athletic trip, or, rather,
agreed to purchase $600 worth of tickets to
the big benefit on held day, which will be
held at Central Park, May 2. The one
thing which apparently kept them from
swelling the sum was the ringing of the
gong which announced that the period
for which all the classes in the university
had been excused had expired. The meet
ing was filled with enthusiasm from be
ginning to end, and frequent outbursts of
prolonged cheers were made when the suc
cess of last year's team or the prospects of
the present one were mentioned. Presi
dent Friend of the student body, who is
also manager of the track team, addressed
the meeting, and in a few words outlined
the plans for raising money and for con
ducting the expedition.
He said that games had been arranged
with Harvard, Pennsylvania, University
of Minnesota, Union College, at Mott Ha
ven, and at the Western intercollegiate
championship in Chicago. He insisted
that the Western intercollegiate cham
pionship, which the U. 0. team won last
year, should be maintained, and he inci
dentally mentioned that the tie with
Pennsylvania must be played off, and that
a chance to see what can be done against
Harvard must be had.
Colonel Edwards ttien took the floor
amid a loud round of applause. After a
few preliminary remarks he made an ap
peal for the student* to purchase tickets to
the benefit field day and to show their
loyalty to the cause in that way rather
than in making a direct contribution for
which they would receive no return.
Among the first to speak up were the
co-ed basket-ball players, who agreed to
take twenty-five tickets. A burst of loud
and continued applause followed the an
nouncement of Manager Brownsill. Some
of the fraternities agreed to take as many
as fifty tickets, and several private indi
viduals came in for twenty-rive. By the
close of the hour $t}oo had been promised.
Another meeting will be held next week,
when a further sale of tickets is expected
to be made.
The itinerary of the team and the dates
thus far arranged for are: Minneapolis,
May 11; Union College, May 16: Harvard,
May 23; Mott Haven, May 30; Pennsyl
vania, after Mott Haven.
The team expects to leave Berkeley on
May 7.
Handicap Field Day.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 9.â The Uni
versity of California nandicap field day of
the spring season will be held next Satur
day afternoon on the Berkeley cinaer
track, providing the weather permits. The
entry list closed to-day with about sixty
five names in the different track and tield
events.
The three events which will attract the
most absorbing interest will be the 100
--yard dash, the 220 and the 440 yard run.
Just at present the university has no very
fast men in these events, and it seems to I
be imperative that two or three sprinters I
of the first class be developed before the
Eastern trip this summer is undertaken.
There are nine entries in the 100, eight in
the 220 and eight in the 440. Captain
Merwin qx presses hope that at least two
men out of the entire lot can be depended
upon for making the 100 in 10 1-5, and
the other two sprints with proportiQnrtely
good time. Koch, the a-11-round athlete,
will enter the 100. This is something of
an innovation for him, as he has hereto
fore confined his attention to the high
jump, the shot-put and the half mile.
There is much speculation as to what lie
will do with the 100. In uractice yestsrday
he covered the distance in 11 seconds un
paced. In the hammer-throw great things
are looked for from Edgren. He promises
to duplicate his recent throw of 147 feet 6
inches.
Following is the list of entries:
100-yard dash â Decker, Hupp, Chick,
Dresser, Koch, Hilborn, "Brick" Morse, Thomas
u!i>l Cuminings.
220-yard dashâ Dickie, Stevens, Hupp, Chick,
Koch, Thomas, Dorn and Jones.
440-yard runâ Stevens, Jones, Harvey,
Magec, Dorn, Hilborn, Robinson and "Brick"
Morse.

Hill nnd Brown.
Mile runâ Jackson, Reeve, Carroll and
Brown.
120 yard hurdlesâ Bakewell, Mclntosh and
Baugh.
â¢220-yard hurdlesâ Torrey, Bakewell, Cum
mings and Dorn.
Phot-putâ Edgren, Lloyd, Greisberg, Hill,
Dorn, Cole and Reinhardt.

Letter From Senator Perking.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 9.â A letter
was received to-day by Speaker Daw of
the Students' Congress from Senator Per
kins, in which he complies with the re
quest to change the terms of his offer of
$200 to the intercollegiate debaters who
participate in the contest on the 25th inst.
When Senator Perkins first offered the
prize he was desirous that $100 bs given to
the best debater on each side. The asso
ciated students, at the request of the
Students' Congress, voted to ask the Sena
tor to give the entire $200 to the winning
team to be divided equally among the
three participants. The Senator has
agreed to ti e request of the U. C. students
in the following letter:
United States Senate. >
Washington-, D. C, April 4, 1896. j
F. IT. Dam. University of California. Berkeley,
Cal.â My Dear Sir: lam in receipt of your
letter of March â¢JS relating to the prize' for
the winners in the debating contest between
the University of California and Stanford
University. I have no objection whatever to
.such a distribution as you propose. That or
â¢ any other plmi which will best serve to stimu
late the competitors trill meet with my hearty
approval. I gladly place the matter in the
hands of those most concerned to make the
best arrangements as to distribution.
1 am very glad to hear that the question for '
the intercollegiate debate relates to the elec
tion of Senators. It i.s a question in which I
have taken great interest and it is my intention
to speak on the subject during the present ses
sion of Congress. Yours truly,
Gxoaox c. Perkins.
Talk of Town Division.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 9.-The second
defeat of school bonds in Berkeley has
again given riÂ«e to talk of dividing the
town. The proposition to divide East and
West Berkeley nag frequently been dis
cussed in the past and the present sec
tional division over the bond question has
revived the issue.
In the bond election for $200,000 the
school bonds carried in East Berkeley by
the necessary two-thirds vote and the
wharf bonds carried by a two-thirds ma
jority in th- West End, but in eacu case
the verdict was nullified by the votes of
the other section of the town.
West Berkeley is still strongly in favor
of bonds for a wharf and East. Berkeleyans
are ready to vote for the schools, but
neither part of the town can carry out its
wishes oecause of the opposition of the
other part.

The Davis Brother* Arrested for At
tempting to Bob Two Young
Slen.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 9.â Eddie Peter
eon and Harold Hughes, two 18-year-old
boys of Peralta street, were walking in on
the Berkeley track near Sixteenth-street
station last night, about 11 o'clock, and
were stopped by two men, who questioned
them regarding themselves. Finally one
of the men seized Peterson about the neck
and held him while the other fellow went
through his pockets.
Hughes meanwhile made for the station
to inform the officers. En route he met
Deputy Constables Dennis Cronin and
Dick Dolan, to whom he told his story.
Later he informed Officer Bcanlan and
Watchman Fosarty of the depot. The
four started on a tour of the vicinity to see
if they could locate the robbers.
Peterson showed up and said the men
released him shortly after Hughes Ipft
without securing any money.
The officers went up the track as far as
Twenty-second street, where they found
George and Milton Davis, two brothers,
who are well known to the police, and
several other fellows, all of whom wore
taken in on suspicion. This morning the
boys identified the Davis brothers as the
ones who stopped them. They were
charged with attempted robbery. Both
were slightly under the influence of liquor i

Appointment of Commander John
J. Brice, U. S. N.,
Retired.
The Appointee, Who Goes to the Head
of the C.mmi sion, Is a Well-
Known Californian.
Captain John J. Brice, whom the Presi
dent recently appointed to the head of the
Commission of Fish and Fisheries, is a
well-known Californian, whose home is in
Napa County. He is a cousin of Senator
Brice of Ohio, and married Miss Tallant of
the Tallant Banking Company, formerly
so well known in this State.
Captain Brice has a distinguished record
!of public service. In 1861 he entered the
volunteer navy and was appointed to the
command of the United. States steamer
Freeborn of the Potomac flotilla. Subse
quently \he commanded the captured
steamer Eureka and the Primrose. Before
the war closed he was commander of the
steamer Don.
Captain Brice was twice promoted for
meritorious conduct and in 1868 was trans
ferred to the regular navy. In the line of
I important duty he commanded various
ships and steamers. The commander has
suffered from rheumatism in late years
and on account of physical disability was
recently retired from the navy.
The office to which Commander Brice
has been appointed has usually been tilled
by a scientist, but he has acquired consid
erable knowledge of pisciculture. While
; In charge of the experimental station at
i Fort Gaston, Cal., he made an extended
report to the Fish Commission on the
proposition to stock with food lishes the
streams flowing into the Pacific. He has
! gained a knowledge of tbe duties of the
i office by observation and experience.
as Fish Commissioner in the service of
the United States he will draw a salary of
$5000 a year. The question may arise
whether his pay of $2600 a year, which he
I receives as a retired officer of the navy,
I will be continued. In the case of General
I Sickles it was decided that a retired army
| officer could serve as foreign Minister and
! as Representative in Congress without
| surrendering his commission. In this
State General George Stoneman resigned
as an officer when he became Governor,
i but was subsequently restored to his rights
jon the retired list. Commander Brice,
I however, enters the service of the Gorern
> inent in another capacity, and the rule ap
| plying to service in' Congress or in the dip
lomatic branch may cover his employ
ment. Commander Brice is about 50 years
| of age, and is decidedly popular among his
J fellow-men in and out oi the service.

HER DARLING DIAMOND
Mrs. F. H. Wath Makes an Un
successful Attempt to Poison
Herself.
She Had Written a Farewell Letter
Full of Love and Affection for
Her Husband.
A blonde about 25 years of ace, with a
wealth of curly hair, was taken to the
Receiving Hospital last night in the patrol
wagon from 13 Sherwood place. She waa
unconscious from a dose of laudanum
which she had swallowed with the inten
tion of ending her life.
The usual remedies were promptly ad
ministered by Dr. Bunnell and she was
soon pronounced out of danger.
Her name is Mrs. F. H. \Vath. Her
husband is a waiter in a Grant-avenue
saloon. He is a colored man and is
familiarly known as the "Black Diamond."
They were married three years ago, but
for some months past have not lived hap
pily together.
In her right hand she clutched a photo
graph of her husband and in the pocket of
her dress was found the following letter:
My Dear Diamond: I see that we mnst part
and I have always told you there was nothing
in this world to part us but death. You see
that my word comes true if I only will suc
ceed, for, babe, you are nothing but a heart
breaker, and I hope you will always think of
me and never break another poor girl's heart.
Do not, whether she be gr>od or bad.
I loved you as a woman and I was as true to
you as a baby from its cradle. If I did not love
you 1 would put you in your grave, but I love
you too much for that. As a mattor of fart I
could not harm a hair of your head, my dar
ling Diamond.
Do not think I am crazy or drunk, for I am
not either. I am willing to die for you. Da
what you think with everything, but'bury mo
with one of your pictures. That is my last
wish. From your broken-hearted wife,
Mrs. P. H. Wath.
P. S. All your friends that have drnnnea me,
I hope and pray thÂ»it they may never have an
unlucky day. Go to my funeral, sweetheart, if
you do nothing else.
Her husband called at the hospital to
speak to her, but was unable to do so as
she was asleep. He said he knew nothing
about why she should swallow poison.
He did not seem to be much concerned
about her condition."
MAUTALEN REFUSES.
ClHiins the County Committee Hat No
Authority to Call Primaries.
OAKLAND, Gal., April 9.â There was a
large attendance at the meeting held to
consider what action should be taken with
regard to callinc primaries. After a thor
ough discussion of the subject it was unani
mously decided that a delegate ahould be
named from each organization to consti
tute a committee on call. The duty of this
committee is to confer with the County
Central Committee and request it to call
primaries in the usual method. If it re
fuses then the committee is to call pn
marits for Saturday, the 18th, to elect
relegates to a county convention to be
held Monday, the 20th.
Chairman Friend named the following
committee: W. W. Knickerbocker of
Temescal; J. C. Ellsworth. First Ward;
C. A. Taber, Second Ward; H. N. Van
Arman, Third Ward; C. L. Pearce, Fourth
Ward; T. M. Eobinson, Fifth Ward; E.
Knowlton. Sixth Ward; W. H. Dow,
Seventh Ward; E. A. yon Schmidt and J.
P. Clark, Alameda; C. A. Miller, Golden
Gate; E. Clark. Xiles; L. E. Oagood, Irv
ington; H. E. Bruner, Hay wards; J. W.
Haas, San Lear.dro. They werÂ» author
ized to add to their number from portions
of the county not represented.
Messrs. Friend, Pearce and Yon Schmidt
were named as a sub-committee to wait on
the County Central Committee and make
known their demands, and there matters
are to be allowed to rest until next wee*.
When Chairman Mautalen of the County
Central Committee was waited on this
afternoon he told the committee that the
committee had no power delegated to
them to issue a call for primaries, and con
sequently he would have to refuse to do
anything. "If the County Committees
should attempt or assume to take any
action," said he, "it would be a usurpa
tion of authority on its part â an arbitrary
assumption of power."

Took No Chances.
"And you tell me." the modern girl
murmured, thoughtfully, "that your heart
has my name, and mine alone, engraved
upon it?"
"Yes," he answered, "and it is the
truth."
"You can also call to mind the financial
resources such as to warrant you in under
taking to supply me with such a home as
that to which I have been accustomed?"
'â¢Of course."

NEW IDEA FOR
A DEPOT SITE
One May Be Located at the
Market and Seventh
Street Corner.
SOME SIGNIFICANT TALK
Information Given by a Well
informed Attache of the
Southern Pacific.
THAT SHORT ROUTE TO BADEN.
It Will Be the Consummation of a
Plan Long Favored by the Late
Senator Stanford.
Among the contemplated projects of the
Southern Pacific Company is evidently
one to establish a depot at Seventh and
Market streets. This it has no immediate
intentions of doing, but all its plans in
connection with bringing in the Southern
Pacific Railroad trains on this side of the
bay indicate thai such is its hope and aim.
Prom one high in the councils comes the
information that bears on this matter.
The statement that such is the purpose of
tne corporation is not a direct one. The
idea is one that is apparently not new to
the railroad magnates, and the plans lead
ing to the desired end are being developed
in the most perspicacious and least alarm
ing manner.
In the course of an interview with an
officer in the service of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company yesterday con
siderable new information was obtained
concerning the future plars of the com
pany relative to the new route to Baden,
lie began by saying:
"The chart, as produced in yesterday's
Call, was absolutely correct. Of course,
the company will not yield its right to the
grant of tideland given it by the Legisla
ture without a struggle. It belongs to the
company by right. It is in its possession
and has been improved :it the expense of
thousands of dollars, and to now ask the
company to give up pos>e>sion to the peo
ple â who, by the by, have not asked for it â
would be an act of the grossest injustice.
"This company does not give up any
thing that it gets lawfully without a
struggle.
' - It may be that the clause of expending
$200.Â« Xi has not been complied with to the
letter. But in view of the fact that a suit
able outlet from these terminal grounds
had not been settled upon, the company
did not know what class of improvements
would he necessary at the lime that it ac
quired possession. Since then, however,
the condition of affairs has changed, and
to-day the company lias a pretty good idea
of its necessities in this direction. The
construction of the coast line to Ix>s
Angeles and its connection â with the New
Orleans line leaves no doubt as to the ab
solute necessity of having a suitable depot
on this side of the b?y.
"To this end the site at the foot of
Seventh street has been definitely settled
upon as the proper place to locate the
depot. The proposed line as laid out for
a connection at Baden will prove that the
Seventh-street site is the only suitable one
upon which to erect a depot.
"This same idea had been entertained by
Governor Stanford for years before his
death, and since his death the present
management has not seen any reason for
a change of plan.
"A glance at the City map will show how
completely the Southern Pacific Company
has the proposed depot site connected with
the numorous lines of the Market-street
railway systemâ caDle and electric. These
run north and south along Third, Fourth,
Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth streets,
and east and west along Townsend from
Third street, where the freight sheds are
located, alone Bluxome from Fourth to
Fifth, along Bryant, Brannan, Howard,
Mission and Market streets. Thus there is
not a phostof a show for any other street
railroad to come anywhere nearthe section,
which will be in all probability one of toe
busiest of San Francisco when the inten
tions of the company are fully and finally
consummated.
'Now there is yet a scheme in the minds
of those who control the machinery of
this great corporation that has not here
tofore been made public. It is this:
'You will observe that the new Postofh'ce
will be built on Seventh and Mission
streets. To net the material to that place
from Townsend street, where it necessarily
will be brounht from mill and quarry, a line
of track will be laid on Seventh street
from Townsend to Market street. Along
thi^ street the Southern Pdcific Company's
street railway ally holds a franchise for a
cable road.
"This will no doubt be changed to an
electric line, which will be constructed
upon the same gauge as the Southern
Pacific Company's regular track, so that
the tars containing the Postoffice material
can without trouble or ioss of time be
switched onto the electric line and pro
pelled to its destination. Butâ"
Here the gentleman stopped and with a
significant elui.ee and a smile Added :
"It may be that such would be the ton
nage of the material that an electric motor
wouid be unable to move the cars. In
that case, ami inasmuch as the contract
with the United States Government would
admit o! no unnecessary delays, it might
become absolutely necessary to hook on a
steam engine to haul the heavy cars.
This hauling could be done during the
night when there would be no passengers
to be carried.
"So you can see that if the company
once got the use of Seventh street for
steam service it might to able to demon
strata the great benefit of having a pas
senger depot at or near Market street
close to the <i<neral Postoftice, where
mails could be received and delivered
without the necessity of transmission in
express-v.acons, as is now being done.
Highest of all in Leavening Power. â Latest U. S. Gov't Report
ABSOLUTELY PURE
"In any case the Seventh-street outlet
is almost a certainty. This can be seen
by the preparations made, and the mate
rial used in the branch line which runs
out Seventh street from Townsend on
what is known as the Potrero branch.
The rails on a portion of this track weigh
105 pounds to the yard, which are the
heaviest steel rails laid on any road on
this coast.
"Again, the Seventh-street drawbridge
exists in name only, as can be seen by
observing that the railroad company's
track is continuous and solidly laid, with
no possibility of the bridge being oDened.
However, at present, and probably for all
time to come, there will be no necessity
for opening this bridge because the creek
west of it is filled in and made impractible
for navigation.
"Yes, the Kentucky - street so - called
right of way has been abandoned. That
route was found to be utterly impracticable
for many reasons. Hence the Fourth
street drawbridge was removed as soon as
the Seventh-street bridge was completed.
This, of course, enabled the company to
run its cars from Townsend street to the
Union Iron Works, the rolling-mills and
Spreckels Sugar Refinery, which is all the
use the company has at present for a
bridge across the channel.
"I might add that on the last visit of
Mr. huntington to this City he made a
careful examination of the entire locality,
and the more thought he gave these plans
the more impressed he appeared to be with
the idea of locating the depot at Seventh
street and running the road over the
Potrero route to Baden.
"I have not heard Colonel Crocker ex
press himself on the subject, but, of
â  course, if Mr. Hnntington approves of it
1 none of the other directors are likely to
! oppose his views, even if they were so in
j dined, which is not so in this case."
Asked if he knew exactly what route
' the short line to Baden would follow he
replied:
"Some time ago the railroad abandoned
! the old drawbridge that they had for years
maintained across Channel street, just
j east of Fourth. They did not, however,
abandon this drawbridge until after they
i had secured a franchise to extend their
tracks along Seventh street, from Town-
Mod to Hanta Clara, then down Santa
Clara to Illinois. En that way they
readied their warehouses and wharves
south of Channel street and east of Ken
i tacky. 1 hey also use this new extension
I for the purpose of connecting with the
Union Iron AVorics, the Spreckels sugar
refinery and other large industries estab
lished on the Potrero.
"Their new bay route will probably
| burrow into the Potrero hills just where
Seventh street, if extended, would come
into Mariposa street, or somewhere be
tween Indiana street and Pennsylvania
, avenue. It will emerge from the tunnel
iust back of the rope walks, or about at
Twenty-second street. After passing the
rope walks it will probably curve slightly
to the west, keeping just above the line of
high tide until about at the junction of
Islais Creek with Mississippi or Texas
streets. A bridge will span Islais Creek
and then it will run on piling or filling
across the marsh in almost a direct line
for the Mt. St. Joseph's Orphanage, under
which hill a second tunnel will be driven,
coming out at. the head of the Bay View
' Valley, near to tne old Bay View race
j course.
"A mi> or so across this valley will
I bring them up against another hill which
j will have to be pierced with a third tun
nel. This tunnel will be almost directly
; beneath -the Six-mile House, which stands
at tlu> junction of San Bruno avenue with
j tuo extension of Railroad avenue.
"Coming out of the third and last tun
nel, the}' are almost within a stone's
throw of the San Mateo County line. From
the exit of this tunnel to Baden the route
is easy, and presents no engineering or
other diliiculties.
"The above described route, as laid out
from Mission Bay to the County line, is
almost in an air line, and, although being
for almost the entire distance within a few
minutes' walk of thickly populated dis
tricts, it is laid out for the greater part of
the distance through vacant lands."
MUST WAIT TILL JULY.
No Contracts for Bituniiiiizing Folsom
Street Will Be Let for Three
Months Vet.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors disposed of a large amount of
work at its meeting yesterday.
It was decided to report in favor of the
acceptance of Fillmore street, from Thir
teenth to Hermann, and the crossing of
Twenty-second and Tennessee streets.
The co mini tee agreed to report favorably
on the following petitions:
Commercial Transfer Company, to erect a
portable oflice at 4.i Sinter street"; Merchants'
Association, to of/er on April 23 susuestions
on specifieationsforstreet-sweepiiifr; Williams,
Bclser & Co., for a private contract to construct
a sewer in Alabama street, between Nineteenth
an<l Twentieth; City Street Improvement Com
pany for a release from a contract to pave
Heale street, from Fo.som to Harrison and
from Harrison to iJryant.
The Street Superintendent was directed
to require tne property-owners on the west
line oi Twenty-fourth avenue, between A
ana C streets, to remove the sand that has
drifted upon the sidewalk and to construct
bulkheads.
The following proposed work was post
poned for six months:
Paving of Front, from Clay to Washington;
paving of Fifteenth, from Noi> to Castro ; chang
ing of the grades and paving of Greenwich
alley.
The petition of James McCoy for an ex
tension of sixty days on his contract to
grade Montgomery avenue was denied;
also his petition for release from his con
tract to grade Polk, from Greenwich to
Lombard.
The protest against the construction of a
sewer in Lyon and Chestnut street to Beach
was set for hearing on April 20.
The petition of the Mutual Telephone
Company for a telephone franchise was
ajain leard today, and owing to the ab
sence of Chairman Spreckels action upon
it was deferred.
Kepresentatives of the Folsom-street
and South Side Improvement clubs ap
peared before the committee and urced
that contracts be awarded for the paving
of Folsom street, between Sixth and Third,
in order to complete the South
Side boulevard system. They were told
that no money could be spared for this
work at present. They were told that
contracts had been awarded for the navmg
of the street from Sixth to Nineteenth"
and that the improvement involved an
expenditure of $34,000. The committee
promised to award the other contracts
next July.
The Street Superintendent was directed
to require property-owners to pave Bay
street, from Leaven worth to Jones, witn
| cobbles.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 10, 1896.
THE COMING OF A
BIG CONVENTION.
National Christian Endeav

This City.
WILLIAM SHAW'S VISIT
The International Treasurer Will
Arrive Here by Next
Saturday.

United Society of Christian Endeavor and
the World's Society of Christian Endeavor,
the largest organized body of young peo-
WILLIAM SIIAVV. TREASURER WORLD'S SOCIETY OF CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR.
pie in the world, is now on his way to this
City.
Mr. Shaw will arrive in San Francisco
at 10:45 a. m., April 18, and will speak that
evening in Oakland. On the following
afternoon, Sunday, April 19, he will ad
dress a mass-meeting of the Christian En
deavorers at the Young Men's Christian
Association. While in this State he will
visit Sacramento, San Jose, Los Angeles
and San Diego, and address mass-meetings
at each of these places to stir up interest
in the international convention to be held
at Washington, D. C, in July of this year.
Mr. Shaw's chief purpose in visiting this
State, however, will be to ascertain whether
San Francisco is in a position to entertain
the international convention of Christian
Endeavor in 1897. Mr. Shaw is anxious
to know how interested the people of this
State are in the great convention and if
sufficient accommodations can be secured
for so large a delegation as will come to
this City.
It will be remembered that in May,
1894, John Willis Baer, the secretary of
the United Society of Christian Endeavor,
visited this City with the object of secur
ing from the railroad companies the
special rates necessary to obtain for this
City the annual convention of 1890.
Owing to a disagreement existing at that
time between the members of the Trans
continental Association Mr. Baer was
not successful, and the convention was
won by Boston.
But the Endeavorers of California were
determined to bring one of the great
international conventions to the Golden
Gate, and, finding it impossible to secure
the special rates necessary for 1895, they
made a strong fight for the convention of
1897. While no rate has been fixed as yet,
the " '97 committee" appointed by the
Golden Gate Christian Endeavor Union to
secure the convention for California is of
the firm belief that the rates which they
are desirous of obtaining will be given.
They believe that the action of the Trans
continental Association in fixing a rate of
$50 for the round trip to Chicago and San
Francisco for the Republican National
Convention is a sure guarantee that a like
rate will be given them, especially when
the convention will be so much larger.
Rolla V. Watt, who is chairman of the
'97 committee and chairman of the com
mittee to receive Mr. Shaw, when seen
yesterday said :
"Mr. Shaw is coming here to look over
the field as an officer of the United
Society of Christian Endeavor, inci
dentally to encourage the Christian En
deavor workers and talk up the interna
tional convention to be lield at Washing
ton next July. But Mr. Shaw is coming
out here principally to ascertain whether
San Francisco or California is really in a
position to suitably entertain ho large a
body as the '97 convention will be. He
will also see that the cost of the conven-
tionâ amounting to $20,000â be fully guar
anteed before the California delegation
leaves this City for the Washington con
vention, and determine as to whether
suitable meeting places and hotel accom
modations are to be found.
"The convention meetings will be largely
attended," said Mr. Watt, "and there will be
three in progress at one time. Three large
halls or tents, seating over 0000 each*, will
be required. All the delegates pay their
own expenses, but must be sure of suitable
accommodations before the convention is
in session. Mr. Shaw is tlie treasurer and
really business manager of the United So
ciety, and his opinion in tnese matters will
have great weight with the Christian En
deavorers in the East."
The Christian Endeavorers of this State
are fully aroused to the importance of
using every effort to bring the great con
vention West. Last July the convention
was held in Boston and it was without dis
pute the largest religious assembly ever
convened. Over 56,000 delegates were pres
ent from all parts of the world. Not only
were Endeavorers present from India,
China, Japan, Alaska. Australia and al
most every portion of the globe â not only
were all these present, but thoÃe represent
ing the largest bodies of Christian En
deavor came as accredited delegates â Rev.
W. J. L. Closs for the 1509 societies of Aus
tralia, Rev. W. K. Chaplin for the 2500 so
cieties of England and the Rev. John Pol
lock lor the 200 societies of Scotland.
While it is not expected, owing to the
location of San Francisco, that such large
numbers as attended the Boston conven
tion can be brought to this City, the Chris
tian Er.deavorers feel sure that a moderate
estimate of the Eastern delegates will at
least number 10,000, in addition to which
will be the Pacific Coast delegates who will
number about 15,000.
The '97 committee appointed by the En
deavorers to brine this convention West
consists of Rolla V. Watt of the Royal In
surance Company, J. S. Webster of Neu
stadter Bros., C. Z. Merritt of Miller & Lux,
Donald Mackenzie and C. F. Baker of
Crocker- Woolworth National Bank.
MIDNIGHT PROWLERS.
Two Suspected Burglars Arrested at an
Karly Hour in the Mission.
Joseph Albright and Edward Lee were
arrested on Mission street early yesterday
morning by Policemen Thompson and
Blackman. 'They were taken to the Seven
teenth-street station, and on being
searched a set of burglar's tools was found
upon Albright. Hi; was booked for hav
ing burglar's tools in his possession, and
Lee had a charge of vagrancy registered
against him.
They appeared in Judge Conlan's court
yesterday morning, and the Judge at once
recognized Lee as a man who had been
frequently before him on various charges,
and against whom a charge of vagrancy
had been pending for some time. He had
released Lee on his own recognizance, and
the case was on the calendar for to
morrow.
Lee was one of the men arrested about a
year at;o for robbing and almost killing
"Bull 1 ' Harrington about that time on
Fulton rtreet, neur Baker. He was held
to answer before the Superior Court, but
managed to secure an acquittal.
The Dolice are inclined to the belief that
Albriglit and Lee are the two men who
have recently been committing burplaries
in the Mission, and Thompson and BlacK
man have been detailed to make an inves
tigation.
COMING THESPIANS.
Performance by Pupil* of the Columbia
School.
The students of the Columbia School of
Dramatic Art gave tLeir sixth public per
formance yesterday afternoon at tiie Co
lumbia Theater to a large audience, which
evidently enjoyed the good things pro
vided. The students were all thoroughly
acquainted with their lines and showed a
marked improvement in their acting.
The fencing was quite above the ordi
nary stage duel, although "attack" seems
to have been more studied than guard.
One young lady seemed particularly ear
nest in the cut-antl-thrust style, and more
of the latter than the former.
The songs and trio from act 1 of an origi
nal onera by A. S. Rnorer speak well for
the original opera, if it be all equal 10 th-e
samples given. A. S. Rhorer and Ira
Ladd sang and acted well. Miss Margaret
Coleman might have used her voice bet
ter. There were a number of other musical
selections, among which were Miss Nora
Moiloy's song, "Come to My Heart," and
Miss Donar's reading, with song, "The
Singers' Climax."
The scene from "Marie Stuart" was ex
cellently acted by Miss Freda Gallick and
Miss M. Colby. Miss Gallick showed der
self to be the possessor of real dramatic
talent, and Miss Colby, with a less showy
part, did equally well.' Miss Minna Ferric,
in "Tne Window Curtain," was good, but
she would huve been even better if she
had cultivated more repose. R. U. Traver
and Miss M. Capwell were both clever in
"An Oak in a Storm"; indeed the lady
showed remarKable ability, and was over
whelmed with flowers and applause.
James Keane. who gave a recitation,
showed that he has improved since the
last performance.
"The Parents' Tribulation," a one-act
comedy, was well acted by G. Phillips and
the Mi-sea S. Gray, C. Lathrop, Helen
Maurier.
11l tin; Herald's prize play "Hearts,"
Miss Ellen Deane and Miss'Henrick es
pecially distinguished themselves.
The musical director deserves especial
credit for the pure and natural manner in
which most of nis pupils sang.
The Seal Rock's Picnic.
Club Seal Rock, virtually Court Seal Rock of

AN OWL SERVICE
AND LOW FARES
The Time Propitious for
Presenting Reasonable
Demands.
STOCKHOLDERS TO MEET
Owners of the Market-Street
Railway to Assemble Within
the Next Week. .
VIEWS OF PRESIDENT CROCKER
Reduced Fares Will Be Considered.
Manager Vining Discusses an
All-Night Service.
"Within a week there is to be a meeting
of the stockholders of the Market-street
Railway Company, and those who ara
agitating for an "owl" or late service and
a 3-cent fare will have an opportunity of
presenting their rase, such as will not
occur again for at least a year.
One of the stock replies to requests for
these concessions has been that there was
not a sufficient demand for them, but that
they emanated from a few chronic discon
tents.
Colonel Charles F. Crocker is the presi
dent of the road, and when interviewed
yesterday stated that the matter of 3
cent fares had never been officially brought
to his attention, and that all he knew
about it was what he read in the papers.
The matter of a late service, he added, was
entirely in the hands of the general man
ager, Mr. Vining. Mr. Crocker then con
tinued :
"Personally, I do not wish to express
any opinion on the matter, and officially I
would have no right to speak unless the
matter comes up before the directors of
the company in some way, which would
enable them to expred3 their views and
adopt a policy, and then authorize me to
speak for them. I do not care to express
myself.as I could, as you see, only do so as
an individual, and that I ought not to do.
"It is a matter to be carefully considered
by the directors, as they alone have the
right to say what policy shall be adopted
and what course pursued in the face of the
present agitation to compel a reduction in
fares.
"I have no doubt that the matter will
come up at the next meeting of the stock
holders for consideration, though, mind
you, Ido not say that anything will be
done. We hope and expect there will be a
great many stockholders presert, and nat
urally some one, in view of all this agita
tion, is sure to bring the matter up, and it
will then be discussed and acted upon."
A call was then made upon Mr. Vining
relative to the "owl" service. He said
that when he first came here to take
charsre of the Market-street railway system
some friend called his attention to the evi
dent necessity for an all-niuht service in a
city as large as San Francisco. He re
ferred the matter to the directors, but they
decided against it as they did not believe
it would prove a paving proposition. It
was suggested that the experiment be
tried, but this met with opposition on the
ground that if it were once established and
then discontinued it would raise a howl
against the company worse than any
simple agitation for the establishment of
sucii a service. For this reason, he said,
nothing has ever been attempted in that
direction.
Mr. Vining then stated that it would be
impossible to maintain such a service by
either electric or cable power, and that if
cars were run after 1 o'clock they would
have to be horsecars. Continuing he said
such a service, say out into the Mission
district, would have to be maintained be
tween the hours of 1 and 5 a. m. , so as to
give an all-night service, as the regular
time for starting in the morning was
SA. m., and it would have to be operated
from the ferry to Ciiina avenue on the line
of the Mission-street electric line, a dis
tance of nearly six miles.
To run a car every half hour would re
quire six cars, twenty horses and at least
six men. The expense would not be less
than $30 a day, and it would therefore re
quire not less than 600 fares, at 5 cents
each, to pay the running expenses.
Another serious obstacle that had to be
considered, he said, was the fact that the
Mission-street electric tracks were laid on
a broader gauge than the horsecars, and
before the cars could be used their gauge
would have to be changed, and connecting
tracks would also have to be laid from the
carhouse at Fourth and Shipley streets to
Mission street. This, he said "would in
volve considerable expense.
From these interviews it would appear
that if proper and concerted action is taken,
something may be accomplished both in
the way of securing lower fares and in an
all-night service.
JORDAN ON AGASSIZ.
Two Hundred Japanese Addressed by
Stanford's President.
At the Japanese Methodist Mission on
Pine street last night President David Starr
Jordan of Stanford University lectured
about Professor Agassiz, one of the great
est scientists of this century and the first
man to declare that there had been a time
when the earth was covered with a frozen
crust.
Dr. Jordan said that Agassiz was a
Swiss by birth. He was educated at
the University of Munich, then, be
cause of its noted teachers, the best uni
versity in the world. Later, Agassiz lived
in the Latin quarter of Parisâ where Trilby
was supposed to liveâ picturesque to read
about, but, like the real Chinatown of San
Francisco, explained Dr. Jordan, squalid
enough when you see it.
Agassi z came to America in 1846 soon
after attaining distinction in Europe and
became professor of natural history at
Harvard University, ft'ien only a little
college. He aiways spoke French with a
German accent, German with a French
accent and English with both a German
and a French accent, but in spite of his
imperfect pronunciation Dr. Jordan said
he has never heard any man that had
such a charming and ready flow of lan
guage as A gassiz.
Ho slept on a glacier for seventy con
secutive nights to study its slow move
ments and had rheumatism in one shoul
der the rest of his life.
"Joseph Le Conte, a pupil of Agassiz,
has been for many years the ereatest scien
tist on this coast,""' remarked Dr. Jordan.
In 1872 Apassiz instituted a scientific
summer school on the little island of
Peuikeese, near Cape Cod, and Dr. Jordan
was the youngest of the fifty students
accepted from the 500 applicants.
