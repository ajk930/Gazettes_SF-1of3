Hunter Yet Leads in the Senatorial
Struggle, But the Deadlock Is
Not Broken. ,
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 7.â The bill to
repeal the Southern Pacific charter was re
ported to the Senate from the Judiciary
Committee this morning, given its second
reading and placed on the calendar, where
it may be called up at any time, unless ob
jection is made. %.!â /. ?-â ' ;?- '"â¢
Chairman Goebel reported the bill and
Senator Weissinger threw down the gaunt
let in announcing that he wished a
record made in the journal that two mem
bers of the committee voted against re
porting the bill, and laid down in plain
terms that the road would resist every
inch of ground against the passage of the
bill. â¢'7;-77v77r ; -*''-*7?7-
Without further debate the simple en
trance of the bill was made on the journal.
It was evident, however, that a giant fight
was on from the start. Senators Wiessinger
and Hays are leading the fight against
the bill and are already actively at work,
assisted by a strong lobby of lawyers.
Senator Goebel is determined in bis
efforts to pass the bill and has made a
thorough canvass of the members. He de
clares that the bill will be passed by a large
majority in. the upper branch, and has as
surances that it will pass the House and
become a law before the session ends. "
Pamphlets and newspapers containing a
history of the bill were laid on every Sen
ator's desk this morning.. Friends of the
road will attempt to prevent the bill com
ing to a vote. â ; *' '?.??'.)
â¢ There was not a great deal of surprise
manifested yesterday morning when it was
understood that the Judiciary Committee
liikh recommended the passage of the Goe
bel repeal bill by. a vote ; of 5 to 2â the
same is indicated in these dispatches some
days ago. At the opening of' the commit
tee meeting Senator Weissinger announced
that General Basil W. Dake would appear
before the committee to argue against the
repeal. : . /{'â¢}'â .
General' Duke, as is well known, has
been on a good salary with the Louisville
and Nashville for a dozen years or more
for the sole purpose' of looking after their
interests before the Legislature and the
' Louisville City Council; His war ' record
gives him peculiar advantages in working
with the first named, though somewhat
diminished this year when the Repub
licans are on top.
The general was a brother-in-law of the
famous John Morgan and was his chief
lieutenant. With the large and familiar
acquaintance that he bad all over the State
with the old Confederate soldiers, with
whom he is very popular, he could get al
most anything he wanted done by the
former legislatures, which were always
Democratic. .
'Old Smoothing-iron" recognized this
fact and established an " understanding
with the general .even, before he came to
reside permanently in Kentucky, which
has since been maintained, except where
the L. &N. and General Echols' interests,
were antagonized. His appearance for
Huntington now indicates in some degree
that the L. & N. is using its in
fluence to prevent the passage of the
repeal, though it may *be that
he is "on furlough"- from him and .work
ing for love of a fee of General Echols.
His non-appearance before the committee
did not, however, leave Huntington 'with
out a . champion, .as Senator Weissinger
played that role with as much earnestness
as he was capable of, though not with
quite as much fire or emphasis as : the Gen
eral would have done. - ;,.."
Weissinger spoke with much show of
learning as to the "vested rights" that
had accrued under the charter according
to the old constitution. He said little of
the "vested wrongs" that had accrued to
the people of sister. States. His remarks
were on the line expected, and as far as
could be judged from the vote were thrown
away. ;' ."'â¢â¢' 7" 7
It was intended that General Duke
should/appear before the committee, but
It was seen that the vote would be for the
bill, and thought best to keep him at work
on the ; . outside. -' He s arid St. John Boyle
and the others were kept quite busy until'
a - late * hour with . the members of both
houses, and : afterward . held a private
meeting in their headquarters at the
Capitol Hotel. â¢'; ;
'In the Senate Weissinger will . have the
assistance of Senator Hayes from Jefferson
County, near Louisville. Hayes is not so
forcible a speaker as Weissinger,; and not
much of a lawyer or parliamentarian, but
he is, from long experience.'a good button
holer and tactician, and ' will do a j great
deal against the bill. He has many friends
from different parts of the State? and % will
wield no small influence with them. .
, They will have vigorous fighters against
them., however, on both â¢ sides of â â ' the
House. '. Goebel - and â¢ Fulton , on? the one
side and Judge Landes on the Â«,: other are
pretty : sure to have the majority of the
Senate with them. ' .?'"-? "
Senator Slige, from Louisville, will op
pose the bill \ vigorously. He is riot elo
quent, but very forcible, and â ; his earnest
ness i carries conviction with it. ;He don't

7 The act to incorporate the Southern Pa
cific Company was signed on St. Patrick's
day, March 17, 1884, by Governor J. Proctor
. Knott, and the same day the â¢ Legislature
adopted a resolution accepting an invita
tion to attend a mass-meeting to ; be held
in .Louisville on - the 18th, to boom the ex
position and attend a banquet afterward.
Governor Knott, his Secretary of ? State,
"Quinine Jim" McKenzie, and W. C/P.
Breckinridge were among the speakers at'
the meeting. * Tbe whole Legislature went
down and they =â  had _> great \ time. It '-< has
been rumored here that 'Governor Knott
and the other two named would be here to
fight the repeal bill, but have not yet ap
peared on the scene. That Governor Knott,
a constitutional lawyer of great experience
who served for eight ; years on the Judi
ciary Committee of .the National House
of {Representatives and Â§ who made his
" world-wide ", reputation as a humorist by
his great "Duluth" speech against the
grant to the -Northern Pacific Railroad,
should : have ; signed such a monstrous
measure as this Southern Pacific charter is
a wonder to most people and they cannot
see how he can have the face to come here
now in its interests. His inconsistency
has been brought to the light. : V-.'k.. â¢'
And McKenzie, whose free quinine bill
caused his name to.be a household word
all over the Mississippi Valley and blessed
by all to whom the chills and fever made
quinine an , article of daily diet, . should
have willingly lent a hand in fastening
such a curse as this charter on the people
so "soon after ; ridding them of the other
monopoly is almost beyond belief: The
lay of the ground during the session of
1884 is . well remembered here. ; Proctor
Knott was Governor, Jim McKenzie Sec
retary ;of State, 'â } James R. â  'Hiridman
Lieutenant-Governor and Charles Ofi'utt
Speaker of the House. Strong lobbies
were on the ground in the interest of vari
ous bills, one of which was to exempt
railroads to be built from, taxation for ten
years. General Duke was here in . the in
terest of the Louisville and Nashville road
against the bill. Another bill was similar
to the Graviance â â  bill - before this Legis
lature to break, up the poolrooms. Over
2000 bills were passed, and with his other
duties and , entertaining his .' friends Gov
ernor Knott and Secretary McKenzie had
but little time to examine critically every
bill sent to him for, approval. : \ ' j . .' *
7 Then he was : much ' inclined to do any
thing asked by bis friends and the' Echols
crowd took advantage ;of this. Knott's
office w as the gathering place of a" select
coterie of witty fellows, Duke, Dr. Watken,
Dr. Rogers " and others . from - Louisville,
Atilla Cox from Owen County, a member
of the House, and ; others from different
parts of the State. The Governor was a
good raconteur and the soul of the party
generally. Ho' was not entirely unsus
ceptible of flattery and was always in a
good humor when ? he?' had told a
story that caused applause and i laughter.
At this crisis he was usually ready to sign
anything \ that any member ot. the party
laid before . him, always requiring them,
however,' to thoroughly explain the provi
sion contained therein. It was, probably,
under such circumstances that " the South-'
crn Pacific bill was made a law." " "
But it was not the only instance .in
which the' witty, good-natured Governor
was taken off his guard. There was many.
another 4 vicious measure " slipped ; through
his hands in the same way. ' /v . "-?

For over half a century he* was actively

was the author of a** compromise measure
in relation to the admission of Kansas as a
State, which ' became a -law and was a pro

name of the "English bill." ; ?
He was ever a friend of the union of the
States and was always a Democrat in poli

Congress and since that time engaged in
banking, street railroad and various j other
enterprises. In 1880 *" Mr. ' English was

j MADRID, Spai. , Feb. 7.â This city was I
the scene to-day ?of a demonstration that
would have required but very little to have
turned it into a serious riot. As told in
these dispatches on Tuesday last, a num- j
ber of men hooted General Campos as he '
was driving.to his residence from the rail
way station on his return from Cuba.'
/A number ' of . the hooters were arrested,
and one of \ them ' broke away, from a gen
darme ' who % had â¢" him in .-â¢.-. custody and
sought to make his escape. The gendarmes
fired twice |at him and killed 'hifri.'? The
shooting caused great excitement, and the
Government *, was * bitterly condemned by
the Republicans. This afternoon the fune
ral fof j the victim took place and was at
tended Â» by 7an i enormous ; crowd. Fully
12,000 men, most of whom were Republi
cans,' marched to the ; cemetery shouting
for the '; entire distance, "Down with the
police 1" "Down with Campos!" and "Long
live the republic!" . â¢; . ' â¢: '7 -â¢ ? ; .'..â 'â /'
The Government anticipated trouble,
and there was a strong display of gen
darmes who, however, appeared to be
afraid to interfere with the .procession in
any way, lest they provoke a: riot, conse
quently the crowd > shouted t itself hoarse
until the cemetery was reached, when the
great ' assemblage J stood with ; bared heads
until the funeral rites had been completed.
The greater portion of the crowd then dis
persed, but â . 2000 â¢; of ; its number again
formed in line, and "' marched '. unmolested
back to the royal palace, in 1 front of -which
they gathered unmolested and shouted,
"Death to the King!" "Death to the
Queen i Regent!" and "Long live . the re
public!" ; , .*
- Even the guards who are always on duty
about the palace seemed to- be intimidated
by the sullen temper of the mob, and made
riot 1 the slightest attempt to drive them
away. After partly \. venting ? their ' anger
against the youthful King and his mother,
the? crowd : marched to. the residence "of
General Cam pbs,' where a similar demon
stration of disapproval was made.
The apathy of the police; which was un
questionably due to fear, was significant.
So far as known the oivil authorities made
no request of the military for aid : in; dis
persing the crowd, the members of which
did as they pleased until nightfall. .
. After -darkness : had set in it was pro
posed to gather under â  the windows of the

Madrid especially to attend the funeral of
the victim of the gendarmes and serenade
them. ?. The polico \ had in % the meantime
mustered their courage arid .told the lead

CINCINNATI, Ohio, Feb. 7.â The chain
of evidence is being more tightly bound
about the Fort Thomas murderers as time
progresses. The admissions of participa
. tion' in j various , phases of \ the I crime [ by
Scott. Jackson and Alonzo -M.': Walling,
continue, and piece by piece the police are
learning all the facts which led to Pearl
.Bryan's \ death _ and decapitation. Last
midnight Walling made a statement to a
. reporter that Pearl | Bryan was murdered
in cold blood by Scott Jackson, who, he
says,, administered a hypodermic injection
of either , prussic acid or arsenic j arid
cocaine, , and . then, cut off her head to
baffle identification. .
U Late this afternoon Jackson dictated and
signed the following statement: ".
, ."Here, with the Bible in my hands, on
my/knees before God, I was not guilty of
murdering that poor girl. ; I did get her to
come to Cincinnati â to undergo an opera
tion. - Walling was to get $50 for perform
ing it. . I was guilty :of getting him to do
it, but not of murdering that poor girl. I
don't know where he killed her, or how he
killed her, or what he did with her after he
killed her. I did not kill; the poor girl.
He is the guilty man. Will Woods was to
send $50 to him through me for perform
ing the operation. " r This is the truth, so
help me God." , ." â¢ â¢: . ,â 'â¢

and tins afternoon demanded the custody
of Jackson, Walling and Wood, who * are
held in this city. , They will probably be
surrendered' to " the Kentucky authorities
to-morrow unless the prisoners refuse to
go without requisition papers. This after
noon Jackson told the Chief of -Police that
on Friday^ night. Walling returned from
Fort Thomas .and. left two valises at
Legner's saloon. , ..'â  7 ? "../. ,
"I met Walling there," said he, "and
took one of, the valises. Walling took the
other. ( We walked over toward. the col
lege. On the way we saw, two students ,of
the college coming toward us. Not wish
ing to meet them we turned down Little
Richmond street. ,~ At 7 Central avenue
Walling arid I parted. He went to the
college. . His valise contained my â¢ bloody
trousers. . I continued down Richmond
street and emptied the contents -_ of my
valise into a sewer a square or so from the
corner of Richmond street and Central
avenue. The valise contained some clothes
and something else; I. don't know, what."
'.' The * police made a search of the sewers
and turned up the trousers. .
Scott . Jackson and Walling were brought
up from the cellrobrri, of the central sta- -
tion this morning and taken to the Police
Court. The men stood side by side :be
tween ' two officers and neither looked aS
the other during trie proceedings. Jack
son seemed the .cooler of the two. When
the Judge had asked the prosecutor if he
was ready to try the cases the latter asked
for a continuance. The case was contin
ued till February 13.. The two men were
taken to the County Jail. ? 7 ;.
The bottle containing . chloroform , found
in Walling's room ' bore the > label of Dr.
Myers & Co., Hamilton, Ohio. Mr. Myers
says he does not know Walling and that
he cannot tell whether or not be sold him,
the drug or when. . :-..*.
This morning Walling hinted that a doc
tor of this city was mixed up in the mur
der. ; At noon he was asked to give the
doctor's name. Walling said: "The doc
tor I mean \ has nothing to do with this
case, only that Jackson had a conversation
with him, in? which he asked the doctor
about poisons and ? the way they worked.
The doctor's name is Littler, and he boards
over at the house on Ninth street." ?
Shortly, after this he' told Mayor Cald-
well that Jackson gave the girl four grains
of cocaine in sixteen drops of water? arid
| then drove her to Fort Thomas, where he
cut off her head. , 7 *. . ? '
Evidence is accumulating to show the
girl, was alive when she reached Lock's
farm where the body was found. 7
Dr. Crane, who ' made the post-mortem
examination, made a second ;r and more
careful analysis of the blood and stomach
and found no signs of any kind of poison.
This is in direct contradiction of Walling's
confession. *? 7

ADVERSE TO THE
NICARAGUA CANAL
Report of the Commission
Sent to Make an? In

COST OF : THE BIG DITCH.
Estimates That Far Exceed
- Those Made by the Mari- ;
time Company.
OBSTACLES TO BE OVERCOME.
Information Submitted by the Presi
dent in a Message to the
House.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. 7.â ln the
judgment of the Board of Engineers which
thoroughly investigated the subject last
summer it will cost $133,472,893 to con
struct the Nicaragua canal. These fig
ures are $64,000,000 in excess of .the esti
mates of the company which now holds a
charter from Nicaragua to build the water
way. The board which "made* the investi
gation consisted of Lieutenant-Colonel
William Ludlow of the United States
navy, Mordena Endicott, civil engineer in
the United States navy, and Alfred Noble,
also a civil engineer. The board's report,
which is included in 200 pages of type
written manuscript, was sent to-day by
President Cleveland to the House.
* The board sailed from Mobile, Ala., in
the United States steamer Montgomery on
the 7th of May last, arriving at Greytown,
Nicaragua, six days later. They returned
in the Montgomery to New York on the
21st of the following July.
On the day after their arrival at Mana
gua a special audience was accorded them
by President Zelaya and Cabinet, and
they were granted the free use of the state
telegraph and of the Government vessel
on Lake Nicaragua. They were accom
panied by the chief engineer and an assist
ant of the Maritime Company, through
whose courtesy the work of investigation
was greatly facilitated.
The most serious problems affecting the
design and construction of the canal sys
tem at the present time, the report finds, â¢
are those involved in the heavy rainfall,
and consequent discharges from the lake
and streams, whose variations of surface
and volume must be taken into account.
The rainfall record at Greytown for a
period of three years shows a mean of 267
inches. ':â 'â¢â â " . * 77 '" â 
A record at Envas on the west side for
fourteen years gives a mean of 65 inches.
In addition to these there is reliable in
formation of precipitation of 3 deg. an
hour, of 9 deg. in nine hours, and 35 deg.
in eight days.
â r.A record of nearly ; twenty-fave feet of
water in a year on the Caribbean coast to
rive and a half feet between the lake " and
tne Pacific needs no comment to indicate
the important results that must ensue
with reference to matters of local drainage
and engineering construction. The report
chbws that the climate of Nicaragua is
misunderstood. It is the continued mod
erate heat in conjunction with the high
humidity that so seriously reduces the
value of physical labor in the tropics.
There has never been any yellow fever at
Greytown except when imported.' The
heavy' rainfall will increase largely â  the
cost of excavating the deep mud at several
embankments, in excavations, building
embankments, etc.
The natives are not likely to prove use
ful in the severe and steady work of canal
construction. 'Jamaican negroes, who
have been employed on the Panama Rail
way, are docile and, from a tropical stand
point, industrious and fairly effective.
They will undoubtedly form "the labor
supply for the canal.
Wages are only about half as much as in
the United States, but the efficiency of the
laborers is proportionately ? much * Jess.
Machinery will be used largely, but will
be of little value after the completion of
the canal; and little, if any,' will be worth
removaL Its entire cost would, therefore,
be charged to " the canal construction,
making the plant charge higher than
usual. There are now no ships or facilities
of any kind on or near the canal line and
they will have to be supplied as adjuncts
of the work. Skilled labor will have to be
imported. '.-"-â¢â¢
Fuel will cost more than 7 double.
Freight on materials . arid supplies will in
crease . their cost greatly, particularly if
sent to interior points. A large part of
the report is devoted 'to * a description of
the character of the soil, the work neces
sary to be performed at points along the
proposed route and the expense attached
to this TO '^ffflMWÃ_'P___ ''"'' "-?'
Detailed recommendations with regard
to the locks, dams and basins follow. * The
board deems it proper to make note of the
facility with; which a breach might be ef
fected at any point of the! long series of
embankments ': employed *in 7 connection
with the canal project. " ' *
Greytown harbor, the entrance to the
canal, *as proposed by the company, the
report says, is too near the angle of ; the
coa_t line and the entrance to the canal
should be moved eastward about a' mile
and a half.
Ihe harbor throughout? should be
dredged to thirty feet below: low water
and its depth increased to six fathoms. In
regard to the Ochoa dam, as proposed by
the company reports, this dam- is to be a
rock till across a powerful ; river on a sand
foundation. A dam so constructed, the
commission says, has no precedent, and its
erection in " conflict with the unknown
volume of the floods present grave difficul
ties. :,- -..?...:". â  *. '" : v-?
In regard to the western division from
the lake to Brito, the report says: "â ?' .'â¢â¢?' â *".
7 "The information? with reference to the
site proposed : . for * the -La 1 Flor j dam. indi
cates that its construction is impracticable,
and the commission ; suggests â¢an alterna
tive low level route which otters no special
difficulties in construction.' 7 '7*7" ?" â '..
;. As to the terminus at Brito the com
mission suggests the ; desirability of mov
ing it : southward, from the location pro
posed by the company. ' '
The report closes with the following gen
eral conclusion : * " *- ;.
.'"The* official statement by the 'company
of $66,466,880 is insufficient for the work.
In several important cases'; the quantities
must be greatly "increased and in numerous
cases .the? unit prices do not make proper
allowance for the difference in cost of work
between the United States and Nicaragua.
The provisional estimate 'by the board is
$133,472,893. . ?,? : '/\ ? 7 : J?
"It should be understood that the existing
data are inadequate as basis for estimat
ing the cost of many. of the structures.
Some portions of the work may cost more,
others less, but in the judgment "of the
board the entire project can be executed
for about the total amount of its estimate.
For obtaining the necessary data for the
formation of a , canal Â. project, ,, eighteen
months' time, * covering . two dry seasons
and an expenditure of $350,000, will be re
quired." . ' â¢ ' -' â ' â "â "â â¢â¢ ''â ""â â â  â

An Interesting Republican Caucus at
Which Heated Arguments
v; Were Made.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. 7.-The Re
publican Senatorial caucus this afternoon,
after a debate of an hour and a half, set
tled the question of a reorganization of the
elective officers of the Senate by the nomi
nation of a full ticket. A. J. Shaw of the
State of Washington was nominated to be
Secretary of the Senate, Major H. Grant of
North Carolina to be . sergeant-at-arms,
Alonzo Stewart of lowa to be assistant
doorkeeper and Rev. Mr. Mil burn, the
blind chaplain, to succeed himself.
A number of speeches were made on the
various candidates and it early developed
that there was such opposition to ex-Sec
retary George C. Gorham and ex-Sergeant
at-Arms Valentine as would necessarily
eliminate both these gentlemen from the
contest. The fight against Gorham was
led by Hoar of Massachusetts and Hale of
Maine. Both- these men expressed them
selves in the caucus as being unwilling to
overlook an attack made by Gorham
against Blame in a ; newspaper of which
Gorham is said to have been the editor.
Gorham was nominated by Mitchell of
Oregon and .seconded by . Chandler, and
Perkins. .-.. McMicbael of Pennsylvania was
nominated by Lodge and seconded by

ceiving twenty-six votes. His nearest
competitor was Gorham, who received
thirteen. - - -, ; â¢;,,:.. -.-

of West .Virginia: . Smith D. Frye by

Mr. Grant was victorious on the third
ballot. "*â  . .

SEDITIOUS TALK
IN THE HOUSE.
Talbert of South Carolina

Right and Would Do the : :
Same Thing Again. ?;
PROMPTLY CALLED TO ACCOUNT?
Refused to Apologize and J His * Utter
'â > ances Were Referred to the?
Judiciary Committee.
WASHINGTON, IC, Feb." 7. â The
charge upon the Hcjk ol the House to-day
that words uttere(7by a member were trea
sonable and seditious and in violation of
the oath precipitated the most interesting
and turbulent scene witnessed in the hall
since the early days of the Fifty-first Con
gress. Talbert. the impulsive Representa
tive from ; South Carolina, arising to a
question of I personal privilege, referred to
the misinterpretation, if not misrepresen
tation, in the press of /what he said on
Wednesday night in response to the criti- ;
cism by the gentleman from North 1 Caro
lina (Pearson) upon the action of South ,
Carolina at the outbreak of the war. He
reiterated what â¢he then said, to the effect
that he believed secession to be right, and
under the same conditions would again do
as he had done. -7;
He was called to order by Barrett (R.) of
Massachusetts, who- asked that his words
be taken down. Barrett offered a reso
lution denouncing the words as seditious
arid.- treasonable and in violation of the
oath taken by Talbert at' the beginning of
tbis Congress. ,-
Much]- excitement prevailed until the
matter was finally disposed of, the .dis
order at times being so great as to preclude
the transaction of business. Â» Many Repub
licans did not approve of Barrett's course,
not deeming the matter of sufficient im
portance to warrant his action, but others
warmly supported him, and one. member
declared that - Talbert â¢â  ought to "- be Â»ex
pelled.
; Talbert Was permitted, after a time, to
explain/? He said he had no idea that the
conditions of 1801 could ever recur, and he
was glad "of it. He had no idea of en
gaging in a violation of the thirteenth
amendment.
Barrett gave Talbert ] the opportunity
and asked him to specifically disclaim any
secession sentiment and apologize to the
House; ;in the even of compliance, Barrett
to withdraw the resolution. But Talbert
declined to say anything further.
Dalzell (R.) of Pennsylvania moved to
refer the whole subject to the Committee
on Judiciary, and this was agreed to ayes
200, noes 71. With this disposition of the
matter the exciting episode ended.

entered a disclaimer of the sentiment n im
puted to him by Talbert, saying he could
not have declared his shame at the course
of North Carolina.'- in 7 the war, for ~ that
would be treason to his own State, to his
own blood? He pleaded that Northern
Republicans permit Southern Republicans
to deal in their own way with their neigh

stood : here to say "'. that he was willing to
extend . . the : right hand ;of fellowship : to

as a boor and ignorant person, advocating
secession at this period of the country's
history. As to the attitude of Southern
men at the time of the war, he desired \ to
say that they; believed they were : richt,
and â¢_ a _ no apology. to make for the part
they took in the war.* [Democratic^ap

ALLEN ON MONROE DOCTRINE.
The Populist Statesman Speaks Glow 1
ingly of the Stand , Taken by
$7 the United States.
WASHINGTON, D. C. r Feb. 7.-The
Vice-President was absent when the Sen
ate was called to order to-day and a reso
lution was offered by Hale : (R.) of Maine
for the election of a President pro tempore.
This was followed by another resolution
by Hale declaring William P. Frye Pres
ident pro tempore during the pleasure of
the Senate. . '. -
.Gorman (D.) of Maryland said he was
instructed by the unanimous vote of Sena
tors on the Democratic side to present the
name of Harris of Tennessee,: whom ; the
Democrats when they had control of the
i body honored Â» themselves by selecting as
i President pro tempore of the Senate.
: , Continuing Gorman said: "Senator Har
ris, appreciating as a matter of course the
compliment which, his colleagues on this
side pay him, has requested me, in view of
the precedents and of his own desire; not
to present his name, arid only,;- because of
that request I fail to carry out the direc
tions of the Democrats of the chamber. '
Harris then took the floor to tender his
profound thanks to the Democratic Sena
tors for the honor they did him in nomi
nating him for re-election.
"In order that, there shall not be even
the appearance of friction," he said, "and
in order that the kindly relations which
should exist between every Senator and
the â¢ presiding : officer shall exist? my own
! personal wish is that the distinguished
Senator from Maine may be elected to that
position in the same manner, as Senator
Manderson in 1891 and as I in 1893."
The Populist party was next heard from,
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska saying that the
six Populist Senators concluded some time
j ago to present the name of the Senator
I from South Dakota, Kyle, for the office of
I president pro tempore; but in view, of the
j fact that there has been such harmonious
union, or that there is to be such a har
monious i union ' between the ' Democrats
. j and 'Republicans^ in; this chamber, he did
j not know that it would be worth" while to
| present his name. ;.?%;?-- . . ?
The secretary, put the question, declared
I Hale's resolution agreed : .to t and requested
I Senators Hale arid Harris to 1 conduct the
: President pro tempore-elect to the chair.
There the oath of office "was administered
by secretary * to Senator Frye, who, in
taking? the chair,' expressed j his â 'profound
gratitude for the exceedingly generous ex
pression of confidence.
The Journal was ; then read and .] the
routine business of the Senate was pro
ceeded with in the usual manner.
* Notices were given of speeches on the
Davis resolution as to the Monroe doctrine
by Smith (D.) of New Jersey ] for Monday
j next and by Blanchard (D.) of Louisiana
for Tuesday. 7 , \ ? r *}??..
Wolcott (R.) of Colorado obtained unan
imous consent to have the House bill to
open forest reservations .in the State of
Colorado for the* location of mining claims
taken from the calendar for consideration.
He made a brief explanation of the bill,
speaking of its importance in connection
with the Cripple Creek mines. ',

* 'and It will be of great benefit to the Sena
tor's constituents, the bankers and capi
talists of York, who think that silver
has no rights." .
;: The bill was passed.
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska then addressed
the Senate on the Monroe doctrine. No
nation had ever existed or could exist
without adopting 7 and applying in 'its
foreign -relations the doctrine fof self
preservation generally ascribed to Monroe
and known as the Monroe doctrine, said
Allen. The 'United States must be the ex-
J elusive judge of when the doctrine is to be
I applied and could not permit Great Britain
or any ; other foreign ; power to determine
when and ;to what extent the acquisition
of territory on the Western' Hemisphere
would imperil this Government. When
the commission appointed by the President
reported it would' be ample time for the
United States to act. If it should then de
termine that the action of Great Britain in

The joint .resolution . requiring' the Sec
retary of Agriculture to carry out the law'
for the purchase and distribution of seeds
was taken? up and Blanchard (D.) .of
Louisiana addressed the Senate in support
of it. He found in Secretary Morton's
action parallel to that of Comptroller

which he had made of the action of the

Venezuelan Commission turned the first
month of its existence at its regular week
ly meeting to-day, all the members being
in attendance except Frederick R. Coudert
of New York. The delay" in receiving the
documents in the Venezuelan case has
caused the commission' some annoyance,
but as "an "average of twenty-two * days
must elapse for a reply to a communica
tion to Venezuela and as the commission's
formal request to Great Britain arid Vene
zuela was not dispatched until January 15 .
the answer of the latter Government can
not be expected for another week.
Minister An'drade this morning received
official mail from Caracas dated as late as
January 30 inclosing a decree of January
10 constituting a commission' to prepare
the evidence for transmission. He thinks
the documents may come by the next
steamer, or at any rate he will be author
ized to present all the papers in his pos
session. ". y/
?Up to this time nothing has been beard
from Great Britain, but the mem bers of the
commission incline .to the opinion that
the report to Parliament will contain an
exhaustive exhibition of the British argu
ment in such a shape as to be readily con
sidered. â¢" 77* .7
Justin Windsor, the! librarian of Har
vard College, who had been requested by
the commission to come to Washington as
an expert, appeared before that body and
gave much; valuable information on geo
graphical subjects. He has been . a deep
student in cartography, and for several
hours the Commissioners cross-examined
him with excellent results.
; Marcus " Baker, the principal United
States Government map ] expert, was also
present at to-day's session, and will fol
low up the commission's ideas as to map
making in the geological survey, which,
by permission of the Secretary of the In
terior, has been selected for that purpose.
. The great map, upon which the com
mission will eventually draw "the true
divisional line between the ! republic of
Venezuela and British Guiana" is noW in
course of preparation and will be an elab
orate affair. It will show only natural
features and will be of * composite nature,
its accuracy being ' verified by reducing
various authentic maps to the same scale
and taking the coinciding data.
Commissioner Coudert came down from
New York a little later, but in time to t&ks
part in most of the proceedings. He re
turned home to-night, but the other four
Commissioners will work' in Washington
to-morrow? and next week, holding no

ALL THE ACCUSED ACQUITTED.

TOKIO, Japan, Jan. 25.â The Japanese
Government has decided to retain the.
. Chinese indemnity in London instead of
converting it into silver and bringing it
out to Japan. The amount at present in
volved is 120,000,000 yen, or about $67,000,
--000 in gold, and it will be increased by a
further sum of 76,000,000 yen in May, when
the Chinese pay the second installment of
the indemnity. Japanese financiers have
had to choose between the chance of a fall
in the silver price of gold and the probable
effect of a large purchase of silver in the
open market. They have decided that the
risks connected with the latter transaction
outweigh the danger of the former con
tingency. The indemnity will, therefore,
remain in London and be applied grad
ually to meet payments abroad on account
of ships and material of war, steel rails,
and so forth. *
The trial" of the ex-Minister to Korea,
Lieutenant-General Viscount Miura, and
the other officers and officials arrested in
connection with the coup d'etat in the
Korean capital on October 8 has ended in
the acquittal of all the prisoners. The
military menâ lieutenant-colonel, a
major and six captains â were tried by
court-martial, the charge against them
being abuse of power in moving the troops
under their charge in such a manner as
to disturb the peace of a friendly state and
to involve bloodshed. They were' ac
quitted, evidence having been produced
that they acted in accordance with the
orders of the Minister, whom they were
Dound in duty to obey, and that they had
no reason to foresee any consequences suf
ficiently unlawful to warrant disobedience.
As for Viscount Miura and the forty
seven members of the legation and con
sular staffs arraigned with him, the public
procurator attempted to obtain their con
viction under the criminal accusation of
having been accessory to the murder "of
the Queen. It was found impossible, how
ever, to procure testimony such as would
satisfy a court of law of the Viscount's
criminality in that sense, and he and the
rest, were acquitted, jj The event has caused i
sort. c' "excitement in Japan, and evok -
f roni the local foreign journals their usu .
anti-Japanese criticisms. They claim that
because the attempt hÂ£S failed to prove
Viscount Miura a criminal it must be as
sumed tnat he had the instructions of
his Government to support the insur
rection of the Tai Wonkun. As a matter
of course, the Viscount's responsibil
ity toward the administration that sent
him to Korea and his responsibility toward
the penal code of his country are totally^
different things. No reasonable person
supposes for a moment that in aiding a
coup d'etat which had for its object the
dethronement of the Queen of Korea he
was acting in accordance with the instruc
tions of a Government whose aim was to
increase the Queen's power and direct its
employment into progressive channels.
The reduction of the insurgents in For
mosa is proceeding steadily but slowly.
It appears that there still remain in For
mosa many thousands of disbanded Chi
nese -troops and that they have succeeded
in enlisting the sympathy if not the active
aid of a considerable section of the in
habitants. It will cost Japan much trouble
and treasure to subdue these rebels com
pletely, but she, evidently feels that her
honoris involved in achieving the task.
Another blow has been given to the
system of employing Chinese â¢ compra
dores y in foreign mercantile houses in
Japan. Ching Yo-ting, compradore.of an
English firmâ Messrs. Findlay, Richard
son & Co. has been arrested upon a
charge of appropriating to his own use
$70,000 belonging to the ' firm. Ching's
method of procedure was to ascertain the
lowest price that the firm would take for
the goods of which it wished to dispose,
and then to pocket the difference between I
that price and the sum actually procured
by selling the goods. ' It- is another ex
ample of the extraordinary confidence,
stilt placed by foreign firms in their Chi
nese compradores despite frequent defal
cations on the part of the latter, and de
spite the fact < that, however ill a firm's
â¢flairs prosper, its Chinese compradore
invariably grows rich. ; :â ;
A sanguinary disturbance occurred in
Kiang-ym on the 19th of December. Some
Cantonese soldiers offered violence to a
woman keeping an opium-shop. Her
f creams quickly summoned a number of
â¢ vilians, and she rushed into the street
raising a hue and cry such as Chinese
women alone can achieve. Very soon tne
soldiers had to flee for their lives, but they
quickly obtained a re-enforcement of I sev
eral hundred comrades,' and returning to
the scene of their discomfiture were met
by a motley crowd of citizens. ' A free
fight ensued, ending in tne death of three
men, two soldiers "and one civilian, and
the wounding of many on both r sides.
The soldiers were eventually driven back,
the city gates shut and- peremptory de
mands for reparation made upon the gen
eral in command. A week afterward 2000
of the soldiers were sent away, but they;
did not all accept their punishment
quietly. A portion of them resisting had
to be surrounded, disarmed and marched
on board ship under an escort with loaded
rifles. â¢ Ââ â¢-.
An insurrection has occurred in Korea
owing to a cause probably unparalleled in
history, namely, the Government's at
tempts to make the people dress their hair
in foreign fashion. This innovation was
inaugurated in the capital by a royal de
Â» cree, the King and the Crown Prince them
selves setting the example. Rumors spread
among the provincials in the ? southeast of
the peninsula that the new fashion was to"
be forced upon them â¢at the point *of the
bayonet, and that troops were already en
route from the capita' â¢to superintend* the
compulsory cutting off of queues. The rus
tics rose in defense ,of their time-honored
coiffure, but there is mo prospect *of the
insurrection assuming serious dimensions.
BIDDERS FOR; THE : BONDS.
Those Who Will Succeed in Securing a Part
of the New Issueâ Eckels'
Denial.
7 WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 7.â Late
this afternoon Assistant Secretary' Curtis
announced that he was able to state that
from a complete , analysis of the bids for
bonds that they showed that bids aggre
gating $66,788,650 above 110.6877 had been
received, the 780 persons making these
bids would be awarded bonds.
The Morgan syndicate bid of 110.6877. for
$100,000,000 bonds, or any part thereof,
would be accepted for $33,211,350. All
bids below the figure 110.6877 are therefore
rejected. â '.;,'-"â >â¢. ".â¢.:.;,:'
7 The gold reserve at the close of business
to-day stood at $44,483,186. The withdraw
als for the day at New York amounted to
$730,000. ? â¢? . ;'
The following statement was to-day tele
graphed by Comptroller Eckels to the
New York World :
In a dispatch from Washington, printed in
the World of this morning, appears the follow
ing as coming from me: "Both Mr. Stewart and
Mr. Morgan added their decimals in different
ink in the bids they had originally put on
their blanks."
No statement of this kind or of any similar
character was made to the World's corre
spondent or to anybody else by me, and there
is no foundation in fact for it. It is wholly and
unqualifiedly false. "!.'â <..- '.Â«-.
The only thing said upon the subject of price
which appeared in the bids of Messrs. Stewart
and Morgan was that j the Morgan syndicate
was one bid only, while that of the Stewart
syndicate numbered over 150, and that it was
evident that the body of all these bids of the
Stewart syndicate had been filled in by their
subscribers, while the uniform price of 110.075
had been inserted by the manager of the Stew
art syndicate.
Nothing was said about the decimals or about
the origin of the bonds or about the ink and
decimals. In this connection it may be ' said
that each figure upon both tne Morgan and
Stewart bids Is in the same colored ink as each
other figure and every statement to the con
trary which has been sent out is absolutely
false. ' . ."7 James H. Eckels.

they be sworn in by the Democrats of the
Senate.
Governor Bradley positively denies the
stories in the morning ' papers to the effect !
that it had been decided to call out the
State troops to suppress any possible con
flict in legislative circles': The Governor
did not deny that the proposition was 'dis
cussed in the Republican caucus last
night, but . he said that he had ' not yet
even looked up the law on the subject.
The talk, was that persons attending the
joint assembly to-day might have to march
through a line of bayonets before getting
into the Assembly lobbies and the result
was a bigger general attendance than ever.
For the first time in J several days many
ladies were present. Senator Goebel, Presi
dent pro tern of the Senate, presided over
the assembly in the presence of 134 mem
bers, 68 being necessary to a choice. The
vote resulted: Hunter 66, Blackburn 62,
Carlisle 2, Bate 1, McCreary 3.
The election of Senator Blackburn is now
looked upon as well-nigh impossible.
Witn the 134 members present sixty-eight
are necessary to a choice. â¢ Of these he has
sixty-two with seven scattering. Of these
latter Senator Wiessinger and -Represent
atives Carroll and iViolett will not vote for
him ', under > any , circumstances. :If the
Republicans spring anything new to
insure Hunter's election the .Democrats i
will probably remain away, and break a
quorum. -.; /â  . â y^\-//'/
The action of the Republicans last night
in withdrawing their nominee and refrain
ing voting, thus allowing the Demo
cratic nominee, Miss ', Guy, to be elected
librarian,, causes a little anxiety among
the Democrats for fear that Populist Poor
was committed to them for Senator incase
Miss Guy was elected? â¢ / ?
Poor declared some days ago that there

With His Toe;
LATELY CAME FBOM MISSOURI.
He Had Been Visiting His Daughter,

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 7.â James
Winters, the father of Mrs. L. T. Hatfield,
wife *of the Assemblyman from Sacra
mento: County,* committed suicide * to-day
by shooting himself in the stomach with a
shotgun. At 11:30 this morning Mrs. Hat
field called at his room and asked him to
come out and take a walk in the yard, but
he refused, saying that he did not feel well
enough? In a few minutes Mr. Hatfield
came home to luncheon, and when his
wife went to call her father she was sur
prised to find that he did not respond to
her knock and that the door was fastened.
! When at last -the door was forced open
the body of Mr. Winters was found lying
on the lounge. At first there was nothing
to indicate that he was dead, but a mo
mentary investigation revealed the sad
truth. ; ; He was fully dressed when found
and a large hole burned in the center of
his vest, from which blood was flowing,
and 'an empty shotgun lying at his side
showed how the deed had been committed.
From the surroundings it was evident
that he must have been sitting on a chair
beside the lounge when the shot was fired,
and that he had fallen r forward T from : the
chair to the lounge. The slipper had been
removed from his right foot, which inai
cated that he had pressed the trigger of the
gun with his toe.
It is stated that for some time past Mr.
Winters has been in miserable health, and
was ' obliged, under his doctor's in
structions,' to take morphine to relieve his
sufferings, and it is believed that the con
stant use of the drug caused softening of
the brain. The deceased was 70 years old,
and was 'born in *â  Illinois, whence he
moved to Missouri, in which State he
lived for many years. A few weeks ago he
came to California on a visit to his brother,
the Rev. William Winters of j Hollister.
On Monday last he left Hollister and came
to Sacramento" to visit his daughter, ' Mrs.
L. T. Hatfield, at her home oh' the corner
of Fifteenth and 0 streets.

are being put through such exercise by

One great difficulty with the new men is
in the sprints, where? they find great
trouble in getting off quickly. All the
sprinters are slow in starting as, yet.
Brunton '99 and* Holbrook . '97 are the
best men at getting off. Much is expected
of Brunton this year, as he has made good
time in the 100 yards, . 220 yards and
quarter mile. Holbrook is a runner from
Michigan University and has a I record of
10 3-5 seconds for the 100 yards. Bernhard
'96 will certainly make a good showing,
barring accidents. Bernhard is Stanford's
hope for the 100-yard dash and the 220
--yard event. Brown ,'97 will run in the
mile and is even now in fair ; condition.
At the present time he holds the inter
collegiate and coast record for the mile
He is one of the â  most careful, conecienl
tious workers on the Stanford : track, and
his example means, much for the other
men. Brown may be called upon to enter
the half mile, but the 1 mile is his strong
hold. /' /// 'â -â â :â :/ 'â¢,.â '.'. . 'â '.

jump, while Dole holds the intercollegiate
record for the pole vault. Johnson '98 is
trying for the ! broad jump. He has done
as good as 21 feet 10 inches in a contest,
but is in* poor form now. ;.

ASSISTED BY TWO MEN.

SPOKANE, Wash., Feb.' 7.â Miss Lillie
Lewis of. this city succeeded in abducting
herself last night. She was assisted in the
venture by two men, who handled, her
father and a brother rather roughly in
carrying out. the girl's romantic plan.
Two strangers drove up in a hack to the
residence of Perry Lewis after dark, and
when Lewis appeared at the door in re
sponse to a knock ne was rendered sense
less by , a blow from a cudgel. The men
then rushed into the house, seized Miss
Lillie, who' is a handsome 18 -year-old
girl, and dragged her into the back. ' John
Lewis, her brother, ran to the rescue with
revolver in hand, but was hit upon the
head by a rock thrown by one of the men
before he could shoot. Before he could
recover from the blow the hack was rapidly
driven away with the two men and the
girl. -.. â¢ â  ;?7?77 77??'i??v.': ; ?7 : ''7?7*-j-"7?"
The girl's parents were wild with grief.
They were unable to account for the abduc
tion and at once had the entire police force
of the city hunting for the strangers and
their captive. The search was continued
all night and forenoon, but shortly after 1
o'clock this afternoon an event transpired
tending to put a damper upon the officials'
efforts. The girl was detected in her
father's house attempting to smuggle out
her clothing. When discovered by her
father she. became defiant and declared
that she had planned the pretended abduc
tion. She was in love with one of the two
strangers, and, knowing that her father
would never consent to her marrying him,
had entered into a conspiracy to secure
freedom from parental discipline?'
Her only regret ! was that she had for
gotten to take her clothing and jewelry.
Lewis attempted to prevent his daughter
from leaving the house, but she attacked
him like a tigress and made her escape.
She is believed to be now. living with one
of the strangers somewhere in the City.
The two men are believed to be of shady
reputation, while Lewis is a respected
citizen and, Miss .Lewis a girl of beauty
and accomplishments. The young woman,
however, is of a wayward v disposition,
having once when a mere child figured in
a runaway marriage, which was broken
afterward through the efforts of her par

VEND. D'OREILLE GOLD STRIKE.
Earth Rich in Yellow-Metal Found Along

SPOKANE, Wash., Feb. 7.â The story of
a rich gold strike was brought jto this city
to-day by a' miner named Robert Hughett.
It was made on ground : along Per.d d'Or
eille, River, twenty miles north from the
mouth. The country is almost impenetra
ble, and has never been prospected; before.
Hu-jhett reports that a miner, a few days
ago, in working. a bar with a rocker,
brought up several- large nuggets. In two
days' work he had - washed out $450 in
coarse gold, most of which was as large as
peas.* Hughett had with him about $200
in gold that he cleaned up in three days.
News of the discovery has spread like wild
fire, and miners are flocking to the scene.
Hughett returns in .the. morning with a
stock of provisions, preparatory to working
his claim. * " -

TARDY JUSTICE
IN EL DORADO.
Ellen Robinson's Murderer
Sentenced After Long
Delays.
SLOW LEGAL PROCESS.
Supreme Court Decides an Appeal
Nineteen Months After
the Crime.
HAD CONFESSED HIS GUILT,
Death Sentence Pronounced for the
Second Time Upon the Con*
victed Man.
PLACER Cal., Feb. 7.-A cold
blooded murder occurring in this county
nearly two years ago, and which has never
been expiated, was recalled when Sheriff
Hilbert returned from Folsom last night,
bringing the murderer for re-sentence. .
Paulo Kamaunu, a native of the Sand
wich Islands, engaged at wood-chopping
near Latrobe, purchased a chicken from
Ellen Robinson, an old lady a6l years of
age, banding her a gold coin and receiving
change in return. Leaving her place, he
and two companions purchased some wine
and drank heavily. About sundown ' the
next day, May 6, Kamaunu, armed with a
pistol, started from bis cabin to the lonely
cottage of Ellen Robinson, called her to
the door, showed the pistol and demanded
her money. She laughed. He struck her
to the ground, trampled upon her breast
and shot her dead.
. Returning to the cabin, , he slept there
throughout the night in a drunken stupor,
and started the next day for Latrobe,
where he bought a ticket to Sacramento.
He and a companion were arrested on the
train and taken to Placerville, not as sus
pects, but as witnesses, suspicion having
attached to others of the crowd. Guilt,
however, soon fastened on Kamaunu, who
finally made a full confession of the crime
to County Clerk Bosquit. This confession,
though not admitted as evidence, was a
narrative of a blood-curdling nature.
In bis statement, Kamaunu pleaded in
toxication as his defense. The jury found
him guilty of murder in the first degree.
Judge Bennet sentenced him on September
18, 1894, to be hanged on November 1, 1894.
The case was appealed to "* the : Supreme
Court, which affirmed the judgment of the
lower court on December 27, 1895.
The date of execution fixed by the lower
court having lapsed by reason of the delay
awaiting the result of the appeal to the
Supreme Court, the criminal was brought
back last night for re-sentence, which was
pronounced by Judge Bennet this morn
ing,'condemning Paulo Kamaunu? to be
hanged on April 10. Sheriff Hilbeft de
parted', at noon with the culprit '-for
Foisom. â -?*''":
The murderer of aged Ellen Robinson is
a hanasome specimen of physical man
hood. 'He received his sentence this
morning without a quiver and with the
stolidity of- one void of every vestige of
humanity. _________^__

MAHER WOULD NOT FIGHT

The Pugilistic Managers Looking to
Mexico for a Scene for the
Combats.
EL PASO, Tex., Feb. 7.â Maher and
I party came down from Las Cruces on ' the
'. afternoon train "and- say they will return
jin the morning. It is not thought their
visit *is of any special significance." It Is
j believed the reason the fight did not come
| off before noon to-day was because Maher
{ refused to* fight until the 14th.
Owing to Maher refusing to fight when
j asked to do so there will likely be a hitch
! about getting his forfeit should the man
-1 agement not be able to pull off the fight on
i the 14th. Had 'Maher gone into a fight
i to-day it would have been to his disadvan
j tage; as - he had not the training here that
Fitzsimmons. has. ;7
7 This morning was quite stormy, snow
I falling heavier than it has before during
i the winter. Governor-Thornton of New
Mexico arrived this evening and states he
: has been in correspondence with Delegate
| Catron and the Attorney-General and that
I he is satisfied the Catron bill was presented
to cover the necessities as outlined by him.
There is no danger whatever of the fight
coming off in New Mexico now, as neither
Maher nor, Fitzsimmons will -take any
chances.; Fitzsimmons is in fine form and*
it looks as though only an accident would
lose him the fight if it should take : place
between now and the 14th.
There is no doubt the way matters stand
to-night that Dan Stuart and those in his
confidence think they will get a concession
from - the i Mexican officials, but i they are
having .much harder roads to travel than
they anticipated. * 7 Â- ??â ..'.'
? ' Should they V succeed in securing the <

. The 'objection' to the funding bill which

ago. â â '"â /' ."*;'*-'â â -â¢ 'â â¢> â¢â¢.-.---â¢-< : ....-. v^
At that time Congress appointed an in
vestigating committee to look ; into the 'if."
fairs of the Central Pacific and other
roads aided in 7 their construction by the
Government, after an exhaustive hear-*
ing of all the testimony that tbe ~" rail
road people had regarding the validity of
their right to get an extension of time in
which to make good their indebtedness,
Robert E. Pattison?"chairman of . the Con
gressional committee, presented a detailed
report of _** the investigation? the closing
sentence of which, backed up by the com
mittee's ' â  deductions from the evidence
placed before' it, speaks volumes. This is
what it says: ; 7?7 ' .7 7 7.'
At present prices of railroad construction it
is evident that from the properties themselves
the Government cannot recover â¢ within $108,
--000,000 of the present value of the indebted
ness owing to it by the bond-aided companies.
Any extension of the time for payment would
be useless arid would expose to further risk
and depreciation . tho present inadequate se
curity for the debt. . "â â â *..â¢;'
â¢ Robert E. Pattison, Commissioner. >
Washington, December 1, 1887. .::.,, -
i- This was nearly ten 1 years ago, * and
Chairman "Pattison foresaw then what
would be the issue in years td come. In
his report is another prophetic paragraph:
'.The beginning of proceedings at this time to
cause the forfeiture of the .charters of these
companies because of their violations -of law
and failure to keep their contracts with the
Government is only â¢to anticipate : by : a few
years the result which will be inevitable .when
the bonds mature in 1895-97. To wait until
then to institute -legal proceedings would not
avert the result; but would further -jeopardize
the interests of the Government and increase
the amount of the indebtedness. It should be
borne in mind that it is a fact admitted by
every officer of ; these roads who testified before
the commission and overwhelmingly, proved
by the evidence submitted, that" the payment
of the debt at maturity , in 1895-97 can "under
no circumstances bo expected. . . â¢ ,â' 7
As an explanation to *- ; the President of
the United States, substantiating his j de
ductions, Chairman Pattison stated: ..>
'â¢;. Had the Pacific roads been built and* man
aged upon honest methods, had the Govern
ment loan been; properly applied, these com
panies, ; regarded as a whole, could have de
clared dividends at the rate of 6 per cent per
annum for eighteen years' from date of 'actual
completion to the present time, upon all , the
moneys that they would have been required to
pay in to complete and equip the roads; they
would have owned ' 2495 1 miles of . roads free
from all debt and worth $124,600,000, upon
an original outlay of less than $35,490,38 L 44;
three of them, the Union Pacilic, Central Pa
cific and Central bianch, could have repaid
every cent of the principal and interest , ad
vanced by the Government to date, and could
have reduced their charges to shippers to the
extent of over $140,000,000, or nearly $8,000,
--000 per year. , ... . ....... ..,ââ-'
" For $1 the stockholders would hatf**. realized
$1 07 in dividends in eighteen years and $1 II :
in land sales. The property would have -been
free from debt, and for every dollar that they
had invested the stockholders would have had
in property over $4; so t hat in eighteen years
each dollar would have yielded $6 18. -..-: -..â â >
But they chose dishonest methods. At the
outset they divided $172,347,115 of fictitious
capital, they dissipated over -$107,000,000
which should nave been ; applied to the pay
ment of the principal ana interest of the Gov
ernment debt, and they taxed shippers to the
extent of over $140,000,000, or nearly $8,000,
--000 a year, to pay for, tlie inflation of, the capi
tal of these companies and for the vicious prac
tices that crept into their management. 'â :-.. --?-'â¢*
The Central Pacific should have been built
for $16,609,203 76 of stock subscription which
should have been paid in conformity with the
act of Congress; all ; debts ; could -have* been
wiped s out, including the Government debt,
principal and interest; the stock would have
paid regular dividends at the rate of 6 per cent
per annum; and for tlie outlay of $16,609,
--203 76 the company would to-day own I a rail
road worth at least $40,000,000 and t unsold
lands worth $12,500,000, equaling an appreci
ation of over 200 s per cent in eighteen years,'
while shippers would have been benefited by a
reduction of over $54,000,000 in cost of trans
portation.' â ;.' -
â  In reviewing the payments made for im
proper purposes by the Central Pacific the
Pattison report explains: *;. -
"i-'ln* the : accounts of the Central Pacific Rail,
road ' Company the diversions of earnings
amounted to many millions of dollars through
contracts made by Messrs. Stanford,' Hunting
ton. Hopkins and Crocker,' with themselves,
for. construction, , leases, * repairs, etc. : They
constructed 1171 miles of .adjunct lines at a
cost of $27,_10,03l 01. On account of that
construction, in addition to a little cash pay
ment, they issued bonds to themselves to the
amount of $33,722,000, and * stock to the
amount of $49,005,800,* making a total Issue
of $82,727,800, of which $5Â£,539,554 repre
sented inflation. " â¢- ".- . , â â â .-,'
r> Then,* as directors of the Central Pacific, they
took leases on their own lines for the -Central
Pacific ; for â  $3,490,828 81 â¢ per annum, which
was at the rate of nearly 13 per cent,
'-.** Fifteen months ago three of those directors
contracted with themselves to ;= build an exten
sion of the California and Oregon division of
the Central Pacific from Delta to the boundary
line of > Oregon, a distance *of 103 miles." In*
pavment -they issued stock to the amount of
$3*000,000* and i bonds .to i the amount of $4,
--500,000, the market value of the stocks and
bonds at the time being $8,340,000. The actual
cost .of v the i construction was $3,505,609, so
that they personally profited 1 oy their own
votes by that single transaction to -the extent
of $4,834,391. -.- Mark Hopkins is dead, but his
interest is still maintained for. his estate and
heirs. '-â .*-, â¢: â 'â ;â 'â * -
â¢t In following up the dealings of these direc
tors with the s Central \ Pacific i Railroad Com
pany and its; adjunct companies it is found
that Messrs. Stanford,' Huntington. Hopkins
and^Crockar "received ** over -$142,000,000 in
cash and securities through the Contract and
Finance Cojnpanv, the ."Western S Development
Company, the Pacific Improvement Company
aud dividends of the Central Pacific Railroad
Company. In addition to this sum erf $142,000,
--000 they also made large profits' in the opera-"
tions of fifteen or more other companies, which
were directly or remotely sapping tne reve
nues of the Central pacific Company. ?yâv.- ,.-,
The total payments by the Central Pacific on
account :of rentals "' amounted to â¢ $29,912,

The -same company also â  expended' $4,818,
--355 t>7, of which the managers declined to give
any explanation or .to permit others to explain."
As the i resources , of the , company, have j been
diminished to the extent of these expendi
tures, and as the road itself will not yield suffi
cient : to i satisfy, the | Governmenc , claim, it is
apparent that the United States are eventually
the 4 losers by those disbursements, most of
.which," as- shown *.bv.ithe ; Huntington letters,*
were applied to corrupt public men and influ
ence legislation. - : - â  -,;.
Tbe balance-sheet of the Central Pacific for
1886 should have ' shown s a" deficit = of ; over
000,000 in the profit and loss account, hut
by omit ting | from j the 3 debit ; side the accumu

vanced, amounting to $31,869,475 20, and by

Â«?S'Fâ¢*_R_- 'â vwhen-the; --actual value was

tne company's land agent, the company made
_Â£?_!_ Of *? apparent surplus of over
â¢T-S,UOU,UUO.
Vi. large sum which has been expended by the
Central Pacific for legislation was posted under
the head of '.'general expenses." The addition
oi that sum would materially Increase the total
payments of $2,301,154 88 on account of legal
expenses. Â°
., Regarding the more intimate payments
that should have been made the State of
California on the ground of taxation, this
is what the Pattison report has to say: ; >Â«
7 Three of the bond-aided- companies, the Cen
tral Pacific Union Pacific and Kansas Pacific,
nave persistently, evaded local taxation, and
nave thrust undue burdens on other taxpayers
by refusing to patent the lands granted to them
by Congress. So long as their land was un
patented it was exempt from taxation; and the
extent of exemption may be gathered from the
fact that they have failed .to patent 8.872,077
acres which they have sold, and they have
failed to even 1 apply for patents on 7,500,000
acres which they have Bold.
The refusals of the Central Pacific to pay Its
taxes to the State of California have been so
persistent and so flagrant, and extended over
so long a period of years, that the Governor of
California on March 24,1884, issued a procla
mation setting forth the fact that for four years
the "Central Pacific had refused to obey the
laws imposing taxes upon their property, and
calling a special session of the Legislature to
devise methods for enforcing a.. compliance
with the laws of the State. -..'.-.,.' ... .-.,
â¢ The Central Pacific had resisted State taxa
tion on the ground that it bad been constructed
under act of Congress of July 1, 1862. When
the commission examined Leland Stanford in
San Francisco he insisted that the * Central
Pacific Company was a State and not a federal
corporation. .-.:.,,
The . Central Pacific has > selected only half
of its land grant in California that has been
surveyed, and it has failed 'â  to select 180,000
acres in that State that have been surveyed
since the completion of the road.
Of the grant to the Central Pacific in Nevada
700,000 acres were surveyed at the date of the
completion of the road * and* about 2,000,000
acres are * now surveyed. The company has
selected about one-fourth of its land grant in
that State. ; "-- '.- *- â  *â¢ * ' * â¢ "'â  * -* *

On May 6, 1895, Benjamin Radcliff, an ;

FOURTEEN DAYS.
Delay Due to a Rule That
Has Just* Been Called
to Notice.
MRS. BROWN IN ARMS.
She Has Determined to Repel
Every Attack on Her -
Home.
LETTERS FROM HER ADMIRERS;
The Information Has. Been Filed
Charging Mrs. Davidson With
Extortion.
It will be fully two weeks before the
council that Re r. Dr. C. O. Brown asked
for on Wednesday evening last can con
vene.
There is a rule of Congregationalism,
which every one concerned seemed to
have forgotten, which makes the delay un
avoidable. Attention was directed to it
yesterday in. the course of ah interview
with Dr. Brown, who said :
I greatly regret that the council cannot meet
to-morrow, and I regret also to find that it is
absolutely essential that the committee should
first make its report to the First Church be
fore the invitations are issued, as you will see
by reading the law on the subject.
Dr. Brown produced a copy of Rev. Dr.
Henry Martyn Dexter's handboo-K of Con
gregationalism, from which the following
excerpts are given as being peculiarly per
tinent to the approaching session of the
council:
In ordinary cases a committee is chosen to
select and nominate to the church thechurehes
to be invited, which are then accepted, and the
committee instructed, in the name of the
church, to issue "letters missive" inviting
them.
Letters missive should be precise and com
prehensive, and no council * * * has the
right ***** to consider any question not
propounded to it.
If it is desired that the case of one or both
parties be presented before the council by legal
or other counsel it is almost invariably "wisest
to welcome all such aid, inasmuch as "light is
the thing especially to be desired. ***** In
examining witnesses somewhat greater free
dom is permissible than is sanctioned by the
courts, inasmuch as "hearsay" evidence is
sometimes of very considerable moral weight,
and a council maybe trusted not to be led
astray by it.
Continuing, Dr. Brown said:
It is no fault of mine that there is to be any
delay; but I am sure it will proceed just as
promptly as possible under the laws of Congre
gationalism.
This whole situation Is an anamolous one.
No charges, have been filed against me, and I
know of no one who is going to file any, unless
It be, perhaps, Mrs. Cooper. It may" become
necessary for a friend of mine to draw them,
and! thus become virtually . my own accuser
before the council.
A noble woman has accused Sarah B. Cooper
of a serious offense, while the one who accuses
me is in prison, where she belongs and where
she has been for a period of years before.
.''-*. Brown is now thoroughly aroused.- She
hatf determined to remain silent no longer, but
torretur'n blow for blow. I may remain silent,
sht' says, but she can no longer endure to do so,
and she is ready to repel "and repudiate every
charge .the.* any one may .now make that she
considers concerns her home and loved ones.
Since Thursday morning each mail has
brought a large number of letters to both
Dr. Brown and his wife relative to the
stand taken by Mrs. Brown on that event
ful occasion. Dr. Brown, with consider
able reluctance, permitted excerpts from
a few of these to be made. â¢ l
The following is from a gentleman who
occupies a foremost place in ministerial
circles in this City :
San Francisco, Feb. 6, 1896.
My Dear Dr. Brown: Last night was the Get
tysburg of your foes. May the Appomattox
that shall bury their lost cause be near.
All honor to your brave little wife. My wife
â¢ays she would like to embrace her.
From a prominent member of the First
Congregational Church came this to Dr.
Brown: \ : ; .
- Mrs. Cooper has provoked this war and has
justified Mrs. Brown in her position Wednes
day evening. Mrs. Brown demeaned herself
with queenly dignity, her voice and manner
superb. Please present â¢ her my sympathy and
my most respectful regards." Mrs. Cooper is
now somewhat engaged in cleaning her own
doorsteps.
Mrs. Brown was the recipient of the fol
lowing from a 'gentleman of this City
prominent in public life: â¢ â¢ .
My Dear Mrs. Brown: I wish I were ac
quainted with you, so I could take you by the
hand and congratulate you on having the
courage to stand ud in defense of your home
and loved ones. . How much better every one
would be if every honest, pure woman would
assert her rights and turn the cold shoulder to
â¢very one that attempts to sow the seeds of
discord. I trust the future generations will
have less Mrs. Coopers and more Mrs. Browns.
A gentleman of high position in the
Federal service wrote as* follows:
Dr. Brown : I have not been : a bit surprised
at the action of Sarah B.Cooper. Being out
side the pale of the church, I can express my
mind with perfect freedom, and I am frank in
saying that I have regarded her as sycophantâ
a woman of ordinary mental caliber, petted
and fawned upon, set up as a patron saint, and
with a vanity for newspaper notoriety beyond
that of the most ardent member of fashionable
society.
As for that daughter of hersâ why, my dear
doctor, I could tell you of an instance within
the last ninety days, where the combination of
Coopers forced from her position one of the
brightest women in this State, the mother of
three fatherless daughters (the widow of a
prominent Mason, who was killed in the
mines), who was struggling as only a mother
can, to get bread for her familyâ just because
she had the womanhood to criticize the work
of Sarah B. Cooper. I have sometimes thought
that the people of this City would at some time
or other find out her methods. *,** I say out on 1
such Christianity. Ido not know Mrs.Brown,
but I wish you to convey to her my warmest ad
miration for her action last night.
Dr. Brown paid a visit to : the office - of
Captain Lees yesterday for the purpose of
consulting with him on certain matters
pertaining to the Davidson case, but failed'
to find the captain in. What the character
of the matter was that he had intended to
lav before the detective Dr. Brown was un
willfng-to state. â¢
When asked if he would attend the
meeting of the deacons this afternoon he
saia he had seen none of ' the deacons
yesterday and had not been invitea to be
present, and, therefore, could not Bay
whether he woulc 4 be present or not. ;'.

by Mrs. Cooper that the nobler and older

port came from the newer element brought
in by the pastor. This gentleman said :

THE COUNCIL.
Its Members Will Be Selected for
Nomination by the Deacons
This Afternoon. ";Â«-: V
Only five of the deacons will be present
at the meeting this afternoon in the First
Congregational Church to nominate the
churches which are to be invited to take
part in the council to ; investigate the re
ports concerning the Rev. Dr. C. O..Brown.
Those who will attend are D. Gilbert Dex
ter, J. H. Barnard, J. J. Vasconcellos, ;T.
H. Hatch and A. J. Dewing. The other
three deacons are out of town. â¢ Thomas
Kerr is in Southern California seeking to
recover his health. L. B. Benchley is now'
a resident of Los Angeles, and I. H. Morse
is in the East on private business. "
There were meetings yesterday between
two or three of the deacons, * but only
informal discussions took place; in fact,
nothing of a definite character cau.be done
until to-day. As the, result of a canvass
of the, situation it is likely that not less
than ten churches will be nominated, and
as many as fifteen may receive letters-mis
sive. With only one or two exceptions the
selections will be made " from what is
known as the Bay District. It will be the
aim of the deacons to select such churches
as are in every sense representative and
impartial. As stated by Deacon - Dexter,
"It is not to be a whitewashing council/
Those which are selected at to-day's
meeting will be nominated before the
members of the church on Wednesday
night. Then those which are so selected
will be sent letters-missive invitine them
to take part in the council. ' These invita
tions will be submitted to each church on*
the following. Wednesday, when the re
spective churches will decide whether or
not to accept the invitation, and will also
choose a lay representative if it decides to
participate. The First Church will not be
represented in the council.
It is generally admitted by the commit
tee, however, that Dr. Brown will be given
the privilege of objecting to any particular
church, and will also be permitted to sug
gest the name of any church he might
wish to participate in the council.
Some question has arisen as to whether
the charges against Mrs. Stockton will be
beard by the approaching council. This
will depend upon the action of the com
mittee which sends out the letters missive.
According to the laws of the church only
the matters specified in the letters-missive
can be taken up. Deacon Barnard has ex
pressed himself as ' being opposed to con
sidering more than one case at a time, so
! that it is not probable that the Stockton
case will be included in the subject matter
of the letters-missive. Her case, it is also
stated, is a matter for the church alone to
decide.

NO MONEY FOR CHINESE.
Banks and | Private Capitalists
Fear the Security of
Chinatown.
THE DECAY IH THAT QUARTER.
:^:'{i\] ___'-'/. -
Property There Not Considered a De
sirable Risk for Mortgages by ?
â '. Money-Lenders. . â 
That the Chinese quarter in San Fran
cisco has contracted ' and that its popula
tion : has diminished remarkably within
the past few years is borne out by the
evidences of Chinatown's decay in the
estimation of banks and money-lenders.
The Call has ] already ; chronicled the
decline of Chinatown, based upon statis
tics from various reliable sources, coupled
with the evidences of failure and weakness
to be observed in the streets of that portion
of the City. '-'
Now it, comes to light that bankers no
longer wish to invest money in property
lying within the boundaries of Chinatown,
and that private speculators are every day
refusing to accept mortgages either, from
Chinese property-owners or. other land
lords whose real estate is in that district.
In their commercial relations the' Chinese
are well known to be exact, -punctual in
meeting their obligations and imbued
with a ; characteristic solicitude of their
credit. It is. not distrust, therefore,
that has : affected the almost unani
mous decision of money-lenders. : Those
seen and far-seeing men have been close
students of changes in the condition of the
Chinese and Chinese quarter in San Fran
cisco and have come to the conclusion that
securities in. that -district are no longer
desirable.
The savings banks have all but discon
tinued loaning on mortgages in Chinatown.
From the presidents of most of the institu
tions it was learned yesterday that loans
have been seldom if ever made on property
there for some time past. The reason, it
was stated in every instance, was that rents
have depreciated to an extraordinary de
gree inside the limits of the Chinese quar
ter, and property values have fallen away
in a corresponding ratio. There were num
bers of stores to rent, many lodging-houses
vacant, or nearly so, and wherever the
Chinese vacated a: house completely there
was no white tenant to rent the premises.
Although the' number of Chinese ( had de
creased greatly, the area of Chinatown re
mained practically the same as in tub days
of Mongolian ascendency in San Francisco.
Mongols withdrew from a building on the
outskirts of * Chinatown, but no other peo
ple would move into it. So. in many cases,
landlords offered their buildings at almost
any rental to Chinese rather than have
those premises lie hopelessly idle upon their
hands. "
. Private money-brokers told a similar
story, but went even . deeper. . . They stated
that Chinese manufacturing of cigars,
shoes, etc., had ah but died out completely,
the commercial prosperity of Chinatown
had waned, and all this combined with the
desertion of numerous buildings in that
quarter had made the business of loaning
money to Chinese quite undesirable.
The German Savings Bank, with its cus
tomary conservative , view of financial
matters, has almost* entirely discontinued
loaning money on mortgages in China
town for the reason that the population
there has dwindled away and buildings
once vacated by Chinese I are |no longer
possessed of any definite value, since they
will not be taken by white people. .
The president of another savings bank
said that it was difficult to estimate prop
erty values in the Chinese quarter for the
reason previously stated.
"In loaning money on mortgages in
Chinatown," he said* "it has been the
custom for banks to fix an arbitrary value
and loan accordingly. It was scarcely
possible to place a certain fixed value on
the property, for once the Chinese would
leave it would not be rented by whites;
and what good was it then? Now, the
Chinese are leaving every other week and
the vacant houses are simply left vacant.
Even the banks cannot fix an arbitrary
value under such circumstances." ;
Judah Boas was one of the heaviest lend
ers of money to the Chinese, with whom
he was very popular for many years. Now,
however, bis financial relations with the
Celestials is merely a trifle in comparison
to what it used to be. '
"Time was,'' said Mr. Boas, "when I
had over |100,000 loaned out on mortgaee
or - notes in * Chinatown, and then 1 in
variably found the Chinese prompt and
good clients. ,
."I- suppose there were a dozen Chinese
in my office to-day, looking for money, but
I nad to refuse them all. Why? Because
I can get better security and better use for
my money elsewhere? - I have not over
$15,000 ; loaned in * Chinatown at present.
The banKs never did do much business
with the Chinese, but nowadays they are
doing practically nothing.
"The Chinese are going home, the old
ones dying out; Chinatown is growing
smaller, and I believe thatin ten or twenty
years there won't be a handful of Chinese
in San Francisco. Their quarter will then
be a thing of the past." , v
HE KNEW PERALTA REAVIS.
Andres Sandoval, a Mexican, in Jail
Charged With- Conspiracy.
The alleged forgeries of public records in
the celebrated Peralta Reavis claim: to
California lands, under a Mexican grant, <
are still occupying the attention of the
Federal authorities.
â¢ 7 Andres Sandoval, : ;â  a Mexican, about 60
years of age, has been suspected of know
ing considerable about the affair, and ) for
fear he might decamp with his knowledge,
he was arrested yesterday by order of the
United States Marshal. â¢?-
At the County Jail a charge of conspir

CHURCH AND THE LAW
Relation of the American â  Con
stitution to â¢ Religious
Bodies. *.*'-;
The Rev. Dr. Voorsanger Makes an
: Eloquent Plea for Peace . and
Equal Rights.
â j A' large and appreciative auditory greeted
the Rev. Dr. Voorsanger last night at Tem
ple Emanu-El. The eloquent , rabbi took
for the subject .. of his discourse "The
American Constitution Considered in Its
Relations With Religion."
"The fathers of our country," said the
reverend gentleman, "in framing the con
stitution ' recognized : God. The humility
and at the same time dignity with which
they asserted the new American manhood
are j plainly evidenced in every line of the
unparalleled document which is the su
preme authority in these United States.
They displayed humility in acknowledg
ing that they were only voicing the senti
ment of a new-born nation, while their at
titude of protest against oppression was
dignity itself. . * .;.-'." *
"In this venerable ' document, which
every true American .must resard as his
'bill of rights,' we rind no mention of re
ligious beliefs and systems. A new doc
trine, little understood at the time, is pro
claimed to the world, but it is a civil doc
trinethe doctrine that the power to gov
ern comes from the people and .should be :
exercised by the people s . representatives,
chosen by the people themselves. There
were religious controversies in those days,
but with them the constitutionâ may God
preserve itâ had nothing ; to . do. ; It was,
and was intended to be, merely a binding
civil contract between the various States,
whereby the States secured to each other?
and to the residents within their * borders,
certain civil rights and privileges. .:,*?*;:. â¢
. "Religious friction existed then as now,
and for, fear . that 'it might develop into
something yet .more? serious, , the first
amendment was added to our country's
constitution," to r the i effect that . Congress
should make no * laws for the establish
ment of religion, nor impede the free-ex
ercise of religious belief and worship. It
must not be. thought that the framers of
this amendment > intended to ' disregard
religion. They 'desired only to denation
alize it. A national church is a religious
system recognized and upheld by the
state to the ; exclusion of all ' other forms
of religion. Where a: national church is
by, law established other 'churches are
merely tolerated. ;
':'.,'. "But toleration is mere courtesy. What
we want in this country is not religious tol
eration, but religious equality, and this is
what the first amendment to the constitu
tion secures to us. Now no church or
ganization can invoke the aid of the state
in order to assert its superiority over other
systems of - religion. - By this amendment
Congress took the sting from any possible
future .attempt at religious persecution.
To be sure the constitutional amendment
could not bind the State governments, but
it did influence them;: and little by little
religious tests wore discontinued and abol
ished. The last State to cling to a relic of
religious intolerance was New Hampshire,
which in 1876 repealed its ancient statute,
excluding ; all but Protestants from State
offices. -j â¢ .â  "'.;'-:f"i'"- ; . : .:
"The constitntion with all its faults, for
being made by man it is not perfect' is the
greatest written instrument this world has
ever seen. It has joined distant and vary
ing elements into one harmonious and
happy Nation.* It holds all* religious sys
tems in equal respect, and holds each one
of : them , equally - responsible before j the
law. It would seem as though the frarriers
had had a touch of .prophetic spirit Which
enabled them Jto make - religious persecu
tion in this country an impossibility;. Let
us ask God to till us with the spirit of the
constitution. We are all equal before God
and the law. Why then should conten
tions which are a disgrace to religion and
to civilization be seen ' among * brethren
If the spirit of .the;, constitution were un
derstood by us all as .-it; should be under
stood we could and would gladly beg the
Almighty to bless: and build up'everv in
stitution, howsoever named, which might
contribute to ; make our fellow-citizens
happier and better."

The firpt- events presented to San Fran

the advancement of physical culture were
in no way injurious to the manly art, par
ticularly the event between Needham and
Green last night, in which the latter was
victorious. This feature was one of j the
best ever witnessed in this City and was a
game and scientific exhibition in which
the best man was declared the !* victor.
Good order was preserved throughout the
evening, and - when the ; exhibition was

who witnessed it are satined that they got
their moneys worth. .The programme
opened with a four-round go "between the
Black Pearl and the Black Diamond. It
looked as though the r Pearl 'had. several
flaws in him, and the -Diamond came out
without a cut. It was lively, but not too
exciting, ending with a little advantage
for the Diamond. ' â¢ . ~

"The next," said Master of Ceremonies
Billy Jordan ; after . considerable delay,
"will be the event of the evening.''
Needham was the first to appear in the

close up to him. ,';

good shape. Twice they clinched to avoid
punishment. Round closed for Green.

lost his footing,' and both men reeled to
the center post, Green falling. Both re
covered and fought viciously toward the
end; Needham showing up a little groggy,
with the blood flowing freely. Green was
punching hard and was the aggressor.
Green favorite.
Fifth round â Both men game; many
clinches, Green ". landing frequently on
Needham's . face and head. .Needham
ducked at nearly every smash. Toward

followed by politic clinching. Green, re

in the lead at the close. '* ".

struck wildly for chance blows. Green
floored Needham once, but Needham got
up at the â  end* of six seconds, returning
with s wild smashes, of no weight. This
kind of amusement was. kept up until the

A Despondent Tailor.
Out of money -and despondent through
ill health, Bernard Lighthold, a tailor,
committed suicide " yesterday afternoon by
shooting himself through the = head, in his
room at 501}4 Howard street.- Â' : ,.".
Lighthold came to this City from Paris
a few yearsjago and opened a shop on Na
toma street, but ill fortune followed .him
and he moved to more humble quarters on
Howard street.
Business, however,*, did not greatly im
prove, and what money had accumu
lated before coming to this country rapidly
dwindled * away. ' The only;: property he
had at the time of his death consisted of
a cheap tailor's outfit, a few books, which
he called his library, and an assayer's out
fit, but he evidently had tired, of selling
his property and: living -on the proceeds,
so he decided to kill himself.
When the body was searched at the
Morgue a number of letters were ' found
which disclosed the " fact that the suicide
had relatives living in New York.
A number of Panama canal bonds were
also found on the body, and it is" very
probable that his loss through that specu
lation was one of the immediate causes of
his suicide.
OPERAS OF "YOUNG" ITALY
"Cavalleria Rusticana" and "I
. Pagliacci" at the Baldwin
; Theater.'* ?.
Mme. Thea Dorre Gives a Brilliant In
terpretation of Santuzza 's
Role. 7 *''â /.
. The multitude of sins in the per
formances of "Cavalleria Rusticana" and
"I Paeliacci" last night at the Baldwin
were covered by Mme. Dorre's Santuzza,
Guille's Canio and, one must add, the
singing of Miss Anna Lichter as Nedda".
Thea Dorre bore . the whole burden of
'.'Cavalleria Rusticana" on â¢ her * own
slender shoulders. The orchestra did not
keep in tune, the tenor could neither act
nor sing, the choruses got at sea more
than oi^ce, and the conductor judging
from the ; Way? in which he hurried the
tempos, seemed 'to have-. promised to run
the opera through on scheduled time, but
with all these disadvantages to contend
against M-me. Dorre's magnificent inter
pretation of Santuzza saved "Cavalleria
Rusticana," and she ' alone made "' the
curtain fall on a storm of applause^, .-.-*
A more ideal: Santuzza than Dorre's it
would be impossible to imagine. Nature
made her ox a type of good looks that
artists go to Capri and Sicily to find.
Lithe, dark and passionate, with the pro
file of a cameo, she looked the Sicilian girl
to the life, and the effect of her natural
advantages had been enhanced by a make-,
up which was correct to the smallest de
tail. The same cannot be said of the rest
of the cast, by the way. Alfio was cor
rectly costumed, but the chorus girls wore
tbe headdress : of the Romana, and Tur
ridu was neatly,: although not appro
priately, arrayed in the costume of a
Venitian servingman of the last century.
Dorre's picturesque appearance, how
ever, was one of the least of her good
qualities. She sang Santuzza delightfully,
her ringing, penetrating voice filling the
theater without effort, and her notes being
clear and true as a bell.-* Her phrasing was
that of an artist who has an intense feel
ing of ; the musical import of what she
sings, and her acting could not have been
more realistic, lifelike and dramatic.
With voice, and gesture Dorre threw her
self so completely into the role of San
tuzza that her personality seemed merged
into' that of the passionate, injured girl
she was portraying..
She held her audience completely under
her spell and applause was liberally show
ered upon her, but applause is only .an
outcome of the emotions that an actress
car. arouse in- the individual; members of
her audience. Although Dorre last night
shoWed | her | power to, arouse plenty" of
handclapping a ; lady seated ,in the stalls
paid her a higher compliment when she
exclaimed In audible tones as the actress
fell prostrate with a cry across the church
steps: "She v sends a thrill through me."
That is just what Dorre did in Sanduzza.
She showed her power so to work upon the
sympathies j of her audience as to , send a
thrill through them, and' the prima donna
who can do that is indeed an artist.
Paynie Clarke did not sing in the"Caval
leria Rusticana," as advertised; his place
was taken < by William' Stepnens. , Max
Eugene was a good, conscientious Alfio.
Bella Tomlins infused a fair amount of
coquetry into the role of Lola.
Dorre's art in "Cavalleria Rusticana"
last night found .'a counterpart â in Guille's
performance of Canio in "I Pagliacci.''
The' tenor is. physically and vocally ad
mirably suited to the role, and he threw
himself into the part with a passion and
pathos that carried all before them. His
singing of "Ride Pagliaccio,'? was a great
piece of art. In his clown's dress,' clapping
his .hands, mocking at the applause the
rustics . shower on him, poor Pagliaccio\s
cry of "I laueh, and my .heart is break

BRAVES TO BANQUET.
Iroquois Club to Discuss "Family Cor
# porations''â The Coming Annual
State -Conference.
The Iroquois Club held its regular
weekly meeting at Pythian Kail last night,
routine business only being transacted."
Louis Metz^er, chairman of the committee
on annual banquet, made a report. On
motion of Mr. Popper, Delmonico's .was
unanimously agreed on. The banquet will
be given February 22, and it is expected
that fully fifty braves. from the interior
will be present. Governor Budd and other
prominent Democrats are expected.
Charles Wesley Reed of the literary
committee said -he' was not prepared to
make a definite report, except that he had
secured the promise of George H. Cabaniss
to address the club two .weeks hence, the
Monroe doctrine being the theme selected.
Mr. Cabaniss will be allowed thirty min
utes' opening and: ten minutes' cloVe, the
members being allowed- ten minutes in
which to reply. .
The committee, consisting of Max Pop
per, John H. Hansen - and George H.
Cabaniss, appointed at the last meeting to
inquire into the merits of the resolution
introduced by John Heenan relative to the
formation of private corporations, offered
the following substitute:
Whereas, There is a tendency on the part of
families holding vast property interests in Cal
ifornia, and particularly landed interests, to
organize themselves into private corporations,
the stock of which is owned and controlled ex
clusively by members of but one family; and
whereas, the manifest purpose and â¢ effect of
each corporate organization is to consolidate
colossal fortunes in families for indefinite
periods and without the power of alienation,
thereby perpetuating an aristocracy based ex
clusively upon wealth ; and whereas, the said
purposes and results of the "family corporate"
system are repugnant to the genius and op
posed to the best interests of our social and
political institutions;
Resolved, That the public good requires that
steps be promptly taken to prevent by appro
priate legislation the, further organization of
corporations of tne kind mentioned; and be it
further ..
Resolved, That a committee of five be ap
pointed by the chair with- instructions to take
such action as they may think proper looking
to the presentation of the above subject to the
facxt Legislature for action tnereon. â¢
Discussion of the substitute was post
poned until next meeting, when it is made
a special order for 9 o'clock.
The annual conference of the Iroquois
clubs of California will . be held in San
Francisco, February 22. ,*; The local organi
zation will be represented by fourteen
delegates, who will be selected from the
following twenty-four names placed in
nomination last night: L. J. Welch,

UNTAXED: SHIPS.
The recommendation of i a committee
of the Chamber of Commerce that the
members at once begin the work ? of "edu
cating the people of the State as to the
necessity for ';â  placing our ship-owners .' in
a better position to compete with the un
taxed ships ' that are now doing the work
our ships should do," is one that ought to
receive the cdrdial "approval- of â  all. It
would.be an important ' part ' of that gen
eral campaign for the promotion lof home
industry on which so much has been done
during the past year, and to that extent
. the Manufacturers' Association* might co
operate with the Chamber of Commerce in
carrying it "on..
â ' Certainly if . any : home industry needs
careful fostering at this time it is that of
our merchant marine. The committee of
the Chamber of Commerce points out that
the San Francisco ship-owner labors under
the great disadvantage of coming into
direct competition with foreign shipping
built cheaply and subject to no taxation.
This is a disadvantage to which no other
industry involving a great outlay of capi
tal is subject, and it is therefore certainly
justifiable to ' urge upon the people the
adoption of a constitutional amendment
providing that all vessels registered or en
rolled at any port in this State, and en
gaged in ocean ~ commerce between any
oort in the United Eta tes "and any foreign
port, or between ports in the United
States, shall be exempt from all local and
State taxation. 77-?'-'-;
The importance of ocean commerce to a
people cannot be overrated. In an elabor
ate history Captain Mahan of the navy
has recently told us of the advantage , of
sea power in time of war. It is not less
important in time of peace. It supplies
wings to all other-industries of a country
and enables them to find profitable mar
kets in the remotest quarters of the globe.
This fact pis well, understood by wise
statesmen, and as consequence the great
naticms of Europe and many of our own
great States have done all in their power
not only to free their ships from heavy
burdens of taxation, but to. give them
every advantage possible over their com
petitors; 7 " 'â ."â "- â '
" San Francisco hold 3 on the Pacific Ocean
the point of supreme advantage. Through
the Golden Gate must pass the vast and
rapidly increasing commerce between our
own growing country, the rising colonies
of Australia and' the advancing! peoples of
the Orient. \ That trade if â¢< it were gath
ered into out hands and carried in our
ships would make San Francisco as pow
erful and rich in the course of time as old
Venice and perhaps even as modern Lon
don. It will never come "into our grasp,
however, if we tie our hands. ; If our ships
are taxed while other ships go free the in
exorable law of competition will take the
trade from us. We shall see the wealth of
the East and West pass through our gates,
but it will be carried beneath other flags
than ours and its profits will be in other
hands. : - . - â '.*? ' ~"0~'
It is certainly full time to begin the cam
paign of education on this subject. The
Legislature to be selected "this year, should
be fully instructed in the importance of
what is asked of them. Untaxed ships
.will bring benefits to "all. The expansion
of our commerce means better markets for
our goods, and to all. producers of every
kind and degree there is an assurance of
gain when through the Golden Gate ships
of California come and go free and un
taxed. â  â  â  ""â¢
HOKE SMITH'S .BOMBSHELL.
With refreshing' bluntness Hoke Smith,
Secretary of the Interior, went at the lund
| ing bill hammer and tongs j before the
House committee Thursday. He had gone
merely in response to a request to explain
why he was withholding patents to rail
road lands. Of t course, this demand bad
been instigated Iby Mr. Huntington? who
never dreamed that the blunt Georgian
would find an opportunity to unload him
self concerning the outrage contemplated
in the shape of the funding measure. The
Secretary straightforwardly â¢ informed the
committee that he was withholding pat
ents because the issuance of them -would
reduce the Government's hold in any
efforts to recover what the aided companies
owe, and because the matter of an adjust
ment of that debt was now before Con
gress. -'-â .'â .,-. Â.â  ._â  -
He took new ground in the matter, and
it is both significant and important. He
.showed that the Central Pacific had vio
lated its agreement to pay its debt arid,
therefore, ; had forfeited its . right to pat
ents. He then said that as bona-fide set
tlers on railroad lands should be protected
Congress should pass a general forfeiture
act with a provision protecting these set
tlers. . Unfortunately, he was not asked to
explain; if he could, why the President
had not taken the initiative and; brought
proceedings *in foreclosure. Not did ]he
volunteer an explanation of . his assertion
that the Government had : already. passed
on the validity, of the first-mortgage bonds
arid decided the matter favorably. "â¢?
Another new point made by him. was
that the lease of the Central Pacific to the
Southern Pacific was voidable because one
of the parties to it was . insolvent. Still
another was that the Central Pacific could
not properly dispose of its lands without
first paying its .debt to the Government.
He insisted, therefore, that it would.be
proper for Congress to pass an act . forfeit
ing the lands, and that foreclosure of the
mortgage should be effected. He con
tended that the value of the' (Central Pa
cific was far greater than the debt repre
sented by the first mortgage? and that the
earnings of the company now "are equal to
3 per cent of the entire bonded debt, r with
accumulated interest? ' Hence .He ' favored
foreclosure and the issuance of .3 per cent
bonds by .the purchasing company, the in
terest to be guaranteed by the Government
and the roads to be held as security.
'.â "ln addition to : all this he insisted that
the Government has the right to pursue
the diverted funds to the directors and re
cover them?? Altogether â¢; his advent into
the case is ; the j most important develop
ment of the ' tight ." thus ; far. :He must be
assumed to be expressing the sentiment of
the â ' President, and this may mean a veto
of a funding bill if one is passed. " * 'â¢'*';.*.
SPRINKLING THE STREETS?
.-â¢â .' It is well enough for the Merchants' As
sociation to? enter ? the lists for the street
sprinkling contract till June, but the fact
should be borne in mind that this enor
mous expense could be practically : abol
ished by paving the streets with asphalt or
bituminous rock. With such pavements

that the * passing of heavily loaded trucks

?.?A , part of the plan of ; the ; Merchants'

yet it is discouraging to see the number of
block and cobble pavements in the whole

would abolish sprinkling, mud, dust,
noise, vibration, filth and media for the
breeding of disease germs. They would
reduce the cost of hauling and the wear

cost less to keep in order than any other

MB. HAMMON' B - THANKS.
W. H. Hammon, forecast officer of the
local weather office, writes to thank The
Call for its suggestion that it would be
eminently - proper for 'some individual to
furnish the $25,000 required for the estab
lishment of an observing station on the
summit of 'Tamalpais. -Of *. course, Mr.
Hammon heartily approves the idea. . It
would be fit and proper for the observatory
to bear the name of its creator, and we can
think of no better way for giving a valu
able public service by the expenditure of
sb small an amount of money. ?
The construction of an electric road to
the summit of the mountain has been ar
ranged for, and the work will be completed
this summer. It will make the observa
tory easy of access, arid as a telephone line
will follow the road, the observations made
at the observatory can be instantly trans
mitted to the City for posting. More than
that, as the summit' of the mountain is
visible from the entire City, as well as from
all the bay and the ocean, such an ob-
servatory could display -signals by day and
night that would' be visible from a great
area. The signals posted on j the j Mills
building could' be duplicated there; r ''â ;:â¢- '
((It is part of the'piari of the electric rail
way company to erect a hotel on the sum-
mit. This would be within convenient
reach of the observatory, which, if prop
erly equipped, would become one of - the
"sights" that- visitors could enjoy. The
daily sending up ; of balloons ; and giant
kites would be a .spectacle? that it would
not require a scientist to appreciate. "?r
. The usefulness of the observatory could
be employed in another way â watching
for wrecks and Incoming vessels. The im
mense altitude would give a': far wider
sweep of * ocean than that which the pres
ent station at the Golden Gate affords.
For that matter, heliographic signals could
be flashed many miles to sea if that should
ever prove necessary, as well it might in
case of wrecks. '?'
? The idea seems so inviting to the public
spirit of some patriotic citizen of means
that we cannot imagine a reason for hesi
tating to come forward. [//Â£s/?

POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.
Some of the Advantages to Be Secured by
Adopting the System. , : ;/ 7
To the Editor of /he San Francisco Callâ :
It 'seems somewhat remarkable that in the
general discussion of ; financial 1 measures for
the relief of the Government as I well as ". the
prevailing stringency in the 'money-market,
so little ; has been said of i the postal /sav
ings bank system. Perhaps 'it is 'â . from lack of
definite information on the subject by the
public. And yet such information is at hand,
the broad and far-reaching : possibilities of the
system may well challenge attention, both as
to its benefits to the Government and to depos
itors and borrowers. . . ..' .â â¢,â :'â¢' â "â¢'/'
/ The authority for the statistics about to be
quoted is the official report for 1895 -of the
General Government through the Comptroller
of the * Currency, whose duty requires , him Â» to
make known* the financial resources of the
country. It appears that there are in the sev
eral States of the Union 1017 savings banks.
The ' number of depositors in . each State, . the
aggregate amount -of /deposits and/ the per
capita of the depositors, with much other val

ily have on hand not less than $1,000,000,000
(one thousand million dollars," and could loan
the whole sum at 4 percent, the 1 percent
paying all . the expenses of making tne loans
and conducting the business.. This would fix
the rate interest so low that private savings
banks could not afford to pay 3 per cent inter
est on deposits and declare large dividends,
and hence in due time the Government would
have nearly two thousand millions in deposits
to loan to the people at 4 per , cent. . As the
capital -of private savings banks *_ a mere
trifle; compared with the amount of the de
posits the bankers would employ their capital
In useful' industries: and become producers,
while . the revenue from'; the postal savings
banks would greatly lighten the burden of the
National expenses. â¢ .*; â¢ : *â¢-;â , v
The growth ; of : the private savings banks
system is an | evidence of its great advantages
to those who engage in the business of receiv
ing deposits at a low rate of interest and loan
ing them at a high rate of interest. In 1820
there were 10 savings banks, with $1,138,570
in deposits;' in 1860 there were 278 â¢ savings
banks,* with $149,277,504 in deposits; in 1890
there were. 921 of. these banks, with deposits
amounting to $1,524,844,506 ; .' five years later,
in 1895, they had increased to 1017 In num
ber, and the deposits were $1,810,597,023.
- 1 The > advantages! to deposito rs of a Govern
ment system of postal savings banks are seen
at a glance. - First, j they never fail; ; second,
their doors are never closed* because people in
alarm make a run on the bank; third, deposi
tors can always get their money when they
want it. These are Considerations which ap
peal to the good sense of any one who has in
telligence enough to earn money and save a
portion of it. -
But there is another side of this subject
worthy of serious consideration. It is the fate
of those who borrow money from private
savings banks.; They are constantly losing
their property by foreclosure of the bank mort
gage at one quarter to one half ofthe property
value; and oae bank never lends money to the
borrower from another bank: the borrower
must go under. This never happens under the
postal or Government system of savings banks
if the â¢ borrower by extension 'of time on his
loan can pay the interest. >
. I close with two suggestions. No demand
has ever been made in any country .that has
adopted the postal savings banks system to
have it abolished. It suits both the people and
the Government! And it ought not to be an
objection to the system that the People's party
has made It a part of their National platiorm.

Tenoeâ B. and B." City: There are two defini
tions given of the word tenor. One is that it is
the highest variety of the ordinary adult male
voice, while another is that it is applied to a
singer with a tenor voice or to one who ; can
sing tenor. The majority of professionals hold
that none but male voices can sing, tenor, and
that : female voices can only sing at it; The
tenor was formerly the plain song, or principal '
part in a composition, and derived, the name
of tenor from the Latin word teno, I holdâbe
cause it held or sustained the air, point, sub
stance or meaning of ihe * whole : cantus, and
every part superadded to it was considered as
auxiliary.*: It appears that the contrary prac
tice of giving the air to the soprano, or treble,
had its rise in the theater, and followed the in
troduction of evirati (male vocal performers
who, from the elevated scale of their voices,
are - capable of singing soprano parts) into
musical performances, since which it has been
universally adopted, both in vocal and Instru
mental music. .. -2i__7_i*727; - '

Change of Nameâ Daily Reader, Los Gatos,
Cal. If a person wishes to change his name he
must file a petition, in the Superior Court of
the county in which he lives, and this must set
forth the name of the applicant, nativity, rea
son for the change, and must be signed by the
applicant and a parent, or near relative In the
absence of either pr.rent. There la no law
against a person assuming a name other than
that of his parents. If such a person should
desire to obtain a marriage license it would be
issued to him in the name . he declares is his
name and the one ha* is generally known by.
If he married, bis wife and children would be
known by the name under which he has been
known. If circumstances should require him
to resume his parents' name he would have to
apply to the Superior Court if residing in this
State". This is the - regular course, but, as a
matter of fact, the world recognizes a man by
any name that he declares to be his, whether
he was born to it or not; and frequently with
out the intervention of the courts The Gen
tleman's Magazine of London, England, pub
lished an article several "years ago, in which
the writer declared that under the common
law of England - a man may legally
change his name as often as he chooses, even
100 time* a day, and that all bis acta and sig
natures under each, and all such names will bo
binding on him. The writer adds that the
only punishment likely to be suffered by a
person so changing his mind is the suspicion
in which he will be held by his fellow-citizens,
unless there be dome good reason' for the
change. . .

THEY HAVE KISSED
AND MADE UP
Divorce Proceedings Insti
tuted by Agnes Hainque
Withdrawn.
THE WIFE IS NOW SORRY
She Says " Sonny " Is Not Nearly
as Bad as She Painted
Him.
SO THEY ABE HAPPY AGAIN.
The Trouble Was Caused by That
Blow in the Face by Her Sister-in-
Law, Mrs. Bangs.
"Walter Linforth, as attorney for Agnes
M. Hainque, yesterday withdrew the peti
tion for divorce which had been filed the
day before. The injunction " which had
The Strange, Brilliant Colored Saurian From South Africa, With the Whipcracker Tail and Wattles Like a Butterfly's Wing.
>..- ,â ".-: [From a sketch from life by a "Call" artist.]
been issued at his instance the day before
by Judge Hunt, restraining the husband,
Martial Hainque, from selling or disposing
of his property, was also dismissed.
All this was done at the request of Mrs.
Hainque, who, yesterday realizing that
she had taken a step toward the severance
of her marriage bonds, found herself in
great distress of mind.
"I don't know what 1 was thinking
about/ she said j yesterday with j tears in
her eyes. '"When I went home after
having been to the lawyer's office and be
gan thinking about it I became so worried
i that I could not sleep. I rose and wrote a
letter to my counsel, begging him to stop
proceedings, but it did not. reach him in
time. It is all very unfortunate, but j
nobody is to blame but myself. I acted
too hastily. Yes, there is another to blame.
That is Mrs. Bangs/my husband's sister,
who struck me in the face, and I was so
angry that I went at once to seek a divorce
that I do not want. ".
â¢ "I met my husband that same evening
and we made up our quarrel. We were
just as happy as we could be until I saw
by The Call this morning that my note
had not arrived in time and not only the
petition in divorce bad been granted but
au injunction had been issued against my
husband. I regret it all very much for his
sake, tor, of course, this publicity will hurt
him in the eyes of our friends.
"Still," she went on, "it may be all for
the best the 1 quarrel, I mean. After the
incident I speaK of,' and my husband not
coming home, I picked up my things and
left his house. 7 We had . been living apart
for a tew days when this step I took
brought us together again and I think we
will live happily now, for we understand
each other better. ' ;
' "I would like to make amends to him
so far as I can by having this published,
for all' I sard- in my petition lor divorce
about his cruelty was greatly exaggerated.
i I was * laboring under great ' excitement
lat the time. To be sure my husband and
! I have had little spats, like "every other
| married couple, I guess, and then his
sister, Mrs. Bangs, interfered â  and brought
this on. She came into my room she is a
little .thing about half my size and with
out any provocation said to me, 'How dare
you quarrel with my brotner
â¢ "I said, 'He is my husband.' ? ** .
"Then she struck me in the face. I said,

MISSION TRANSFERS.

The Devisadero-street Property Owners'
Club has declared itself against Manager
Vining of the Market-street, cable system?
A < its recent meeting \ President H. "VV.
Miller recalled .; Manager Vining's failure'
to keep his promise .in regard to giving a
better car service to and from the Mission
districts. . ?7
It appears that a few months ago Mr,
Vining stated to a * committee of the club
that as soon as the Fillmore-street line was
completed he would issue transfers south
from the Devisadero line into the Mission,
and at Fillmore and Eddy to the Devisa
dero line west. ,;.
These promises of Mr. Vining have been
broken, and it was decided that a commit
tee meet the gentleman and find out why
he refused to .help out the Devisadero
street residents, who 'had sacrificed their
beautiful boulevard to the park and peti
tioned the Supervisors for an electric road.
The committee, -consisting of Dr. T.E.
Shumate, Adolph Meyer, H.W. Miller
and James Spanton, called on Mr. Vining
yesterday afternoon.' -They; explained ; to
him that unless they ' were given \, part of
the advantages promised when the rail
road company, pestered them for their
signatures -to "build - a road, a movement
would be placed on foot to' ask for the an
nulling of the franchise.
Mr. Vining assured the committee .that
he would.' do all; in his power to assist
them. He felt powerless, however, on ac
count of the absence of H. E. Huntington,
who is in Kentucky. But he stated that
at the next meeting of the directors he
would recommend the transfer system de
sired by the committee. =
Mr. Vining asked if the committee
would not be satisfied to wait until after
the completion of the Page-street line,
when he would give the transfers from
Devisadero street to Page street and thence
to Fillmore street. This was- not agree
able to the committee and it was agreed
to wait until the return of H. E. Hunting

WHO STOLE THE MONEY?!
Joe Harvey, the Sporting Man,
Loses Four Hundred
Dollars.
Hong Toy, His Chinese Servant, Is
Arrested on Suspicion of Be
ing the Thief.
Joe Harvey, the well-known . sporting
man, who lives on Eddy street, near Tay
lor, has been the victim of a sneak thief or
burglar, and he mourns the loss of $400 in
gold.
What makes the loss of the money more
galling to Harvey is that he had it in trust
for a sporting man, and will have to make
good the amount to him. 777 â  7-' v.â¢
The money was kept in a small tin box,
which was securely locked, and placed in a
bureau drawer in Harvey's bedroom, which
was also s kept '*. locked to make its safety
doubly sure. \A. r ,-
Yesterday morning, when Harvey left
his bedroom he unlocked the bureau
drawer, and satisfied himself that the tin
box and the money were all right. When
he returned a few hours later the bureau
drawer was open. The tin box lay on the
floor, and the $400 in gold had disappeared.
An examination showed that the drawer
and tin box had both forced open by
the use of some instrument, and* on the
floor in a corner lay an icepick, which had
evidently been used by the thief. â¢"
The icepick had been kept in the kitchen
and its exact location was known only to
Hong Toy, the Chinese servant, and Har
vey's suspicions fell upon him. He did not
say anything to the Chinese! but hurried
to police headquarters with the icepick in
his. pocket and reported the loss of the
money and his suspicions.
Detective Harry Reynolds was detailed
on the case and be went to Harvey's house.
After making an investigation he ' took
Hong Toy " to 2' police ; headquarters. De
tective 'Bainbridge' after closely scrutiniz
ing the , Chinese ana examining certain
scars on his face thought he was an ex
convict, but was not (quite sure. To all
questions Hong Toy gave the same an
swer, ;; "No sabe." ;He was carefully
searched, but no money was found in: his
possession.;: He will be detained in "the
tanks" pending further inquiries.

A Strange Animal [ From , South
â  7 Africa Causes Crowds at
_â â¢'Â« the Occidental.
CAN'T MAKE OUT WHAT IT IS.
Changes Its Color at Different Periods ;
of the Day and Tells the Time
.Like a Watch.
There is a curioul animal at the Occi
dental Hotel, the like of which has never
before ? been seen here, and which has
aroused a great deal of interest. 7
It is what is vaguely termed a South
African : lizard, because â¢it came â 'â â â  from
South Africa. Professor 0.- H. Harkness
and President David . Starr Jordan : have
been inspecting it. .Lesser scientists have
also called to see it. Most of the scientists
have admitted that they were stumped by
the , reptile, while ) others merely ' looked
wise and went away without saying any
thing. '.- â  * â -â  77- â¢*''â¢â¢ /y//.
| J. S. Pnrdy, the Bush-street commission
merchant, is the ? owner. He got it of D.
Rule, a friend, who bequeathed it to him.
Rule received it from a ship captain who
came up from Panama, and who had been
presented with the queer reptile by a man
who had come up from South Africa.
Several scientists have coveted the
saurian from Mr. Purdy, but he thinks too
much of him to let him go, at least while
he lives. So the scientists ! have abridged
their requests to the possibility of his de
mise. "'*â '--; 'â 'â  â â ' ' : 'Jy, : ':'-" -:-"â 'â  '-
"If he dies, I*'1 *' wrote one Stanford pro
fessor to Mr.. Purdy, "all I ask of you is
that you give him to" the university."
Dr. Luke Robinson took a look at him
yesterday, among many others. '.'.'â  He
doesn't profess "' to be a ' sharp regarding
such: animals, but lie said he Â« would 'like
the privilege lof J bringing j some scientific
friends to sit in judgment on the stranger."
This request Mr. Purdy readily granted. â¢
The animal is : kept in the rear barroom
of the Occidental. It is about three and a
half feet long. Its head is much like the
head of a turtle, but it has embroidered
wattles beneath, which fall like the wings
of a butterfly. :â :;:;
; Along the ridge of the back for probably
a foot is a row of protuberances ' resem- ;
bling spines, but which are almost feathery
in character, serving more as an ornament
than as; weapons -of defense! The tail
dawdles to an intolerable length, the final
ending fora foot and a half resembling
the tail of a braided buckskin whip, with
two or three mottles, like rattlesnake
mottles, at the bigger point.
From there to I the head- the .general
color is greenish, though at different times
of the day the reptile changes his hue like
a chameleon. The change begins at the
side of the head or throat, when first from
a peacock color it turns to gold and
brown.
â  In the. other changes which follow the
saurian takes on a variety of colors, but
they : are most ' beautiful. The brilliant
colors begin at 4 o'clock in the* afternoon.
"If you watch him close enough during
the day you will! get so you won't need a
watch. You can tell what ' time it is by
looking at him. ".?'-â :
"He's a daisy. I wouldn't part with
him for anything. A good many scientific
men have -been here and looked at him
and ? others are to come, but they can't
make out just what he is: except that he
is the strangest of all the lizards that ever
was seen probably. T;
.'; "This whip-crackers' tail , that he has
enables him to climb a tree and sleep at
night. With a' wrap or two of it* over ' a
limb he can doze off without fear of being
nipped by any bigger animal. He goes up
in his cage and sleeps that way often. ;
"He eats bugs and . insects :of : various
sorts and ordinary hen's eggs.' The latter
are what I put in for him, but'; he won't
eat much. For six months past he is sup
posed to have been in a stupor, like a bear
in winter. ? He came all the way over from
South Africa, and didn't eat anything dur
ing all that time." . â¢*-.-.
'(> The 'brilliant reptile dragged : himself
around the cage lazily when Mr. , Purdy
prodded him up. Occasionally he stroked
him with bis hand. 777* ;
7 Mr. Purdy thinks he isn't poisonous,
and one thing in his favor is that he hasn't
tried to bite anybody. ;As be doesn't open
his mouth nobody knows what his teeth
are like. : . ; .-* '-<^;.-\

Will Sell the ? Pacific. Bank Property
Against Attorney Flournoy's
'â *'â¢. Advice,
Matters of management of the People's
Home Savings Bank have \ developed seri
ous complications within the last few days, 4 '
and / where the trouble may end can be
seen only after what promises to be another
addition to the long | list of lawsuits over
the liquidation of the bank's affairs.
, The latest phase 7of this institution's
bac ly mixed business is ; a decided differ
lenceI ence of opinion between the new board of
directors and its legal adviser, John Flour
noy. When ; the ' attorney 'â ' expresses â  his
opinion ) regarding ' questions of i great im
portance he -7 is ? beard 'â  courteously enough *
by the directors, 1 who,' it is said, forthwith
conclude to do just I the - exact i opposite' of
.what he recommends. And thus there has
arisen a new complication, which the de
positors believe must bring about an open
rupture between the board and the attor-
ney.\:Vv;77 v 7 ''?.7- : 77? : ' "??7:7??' .'-'â 
; This very result is expected to take place
before Â« long, ";' if - not -^indeed, ;. to-day. : . A
special meeting of the People's Home
Bank : , directors was 1 called V for yesterday,
but for some reason it was 'laid over until
to-day. ; The object of this special session
is to put through : the sale *of the "Pacific
Bank . property for ; $130,000. â¢ The sum of
$140,000 has been offered by R. D. McElroy
for the property. Mr. McElroy made three
bids, the lowest i having been $132,000 and
the second $136,000; but certain members
of the board favored the "sale to the Con
tinental Insurance Company for $130,000.
? Attorney Floufnoy ; advised the directors
against > effecting the sale until after the
determination of the .Continental Com
pany's suit, which will probably be effected
on Monday next.' â¢ ' " .
. The prevailing impression on the part of
depositors is that this prospective action
of the directors is simply an effort to let a
favored bidder purchase ' the property, for
less that its value. One reason : assigned
for this is that the purchaser is willing* to
take it and take chances so far as tbe suits
over the property are concerned ; â  but that
in fact it does not help the depositors, be
cause the rights of the litigants would be
such- that they could follow the fund, if
not the. property. In other .words, the
Pacific Bank directors who are yet' fight
ing for the property could pursue by legal
process the sum ! of ; $130,000 " paid for it,
quite ; as readily as keeping up a contest
for the bank building itself. 'â .- * ,
" Mr. Fiournoy and{the law ' firm , of. Gun
nison, Booth & Bartnett declare they can
see nothing in the i suits to cause the Peo
ple's Bank directors the least uneasiness,
for the suits can easily be got out of the
way, and then there will remain no in.
cumbrance upon the property.' This is the
second case in which the directors have
acted against the advice of Mr. Flonrnov,
who, it is claimed, is honestly performing
his duty as a lawyer. The belief is held by
several interested parties that this will
cause a row between the attorney and the
board, since the latter desires to do as it
sees fit regardless of legal advice.
The Trust Company is opposed 'to the
sale of the - s Pacific Bank : property ,; for
$130,000 while an offer of $140,000 is stand
ing. It also believes that the insurance
company's case ought to be tried and set
tled at once " and. the property, sold to the
highest bidder, and the money distributed
legally and as expeditiously as possible.
Should the bank directors act otherwise it
is likely that the ablest legal battle over
the bank property will i be started without
delay.

MRS. STANFORD AT HOME
Fully Expects a Favorable De

Waiting.
Four Months Spent in a Tour of the
East, but Principally at
Washington.
Mrs. Stanford is home again, having
arrived in this City yesterday forenoon
from Washington, where she has been so
anxiously awaiting f the final ; decision in
the $15,000,000 Government suit. !
â¢' During her absence of four months from
California she visited parts of Canada and
many of the larger cities of the East prior
to her stay at the capital. There alone for
a short time only she was not in the best
of health, and in consequence of her ill
ness was â¢ unable' to hear the : argument
made before the Supreme Court in behalf
of her case by Joseph Choate of New YorK.
Otherwise Mrs. Stanford's? Eastern, trip,
aside from the i constant suspense of * the
long-pending - suit, was conducive to her
health, and it was partly 'for the needed
change that she left this City.
Upon -: arriving at the Sixteenth-street

Josiah Stanford; Dr. Harkness and Charles

they accompanied her to this side of the

The Hayes-Street 'Road to Be Ex
tended From the Park to

BICHMOND DISTRICT .EVENTS.
The Cemetery Question Causes Dissen
sionâ Sutro's Electric Road is *
7 Censured. '
The actual completion and operation of
the Sutro road has 1 enlivened real estate
matters in the Richmond district to no
small extent. There is a strong demand
for property now made accessible, and in
consequence the real estate men are happy.
"The real estate sales in 1895 were fully
30 per i cent greater than the preceding
year," said T. G. Parker yesterday. "The
current year has commenced most flatter
ingly, the sales so far showing an increase
of 50 per cent over the same period of 1895.
This is due in a great degree to the com
pletion of the new electric line to the
ocean. People are not only buying more
property, but tbey are improving it, which
fact is of course to our greater advantage."
While the real estate interests of Rich
mond are advancing, the Market-street
Railway is figuratively doing the same
thing, though its efforts are directed in
another channel. Sutro's road has cut a
big hole in the daily â  receipts, and when
the new bandstand. in Golden Gate Park
is completed they will find, many more
nickels slipping from their grasp. The
people's road has a branch running from
Eighth avenue to the park, and within a
short distance of the bandstand, so that
they will naturally control a big part of
the park traffic.
In order to overcome this as much as
possible, the Market-street Company has
determined to extend the Hayes-street
cable system from Stanyan street to the
ocean. Electricity will be the power em
ployed over the entire line. The route to
the beach is as follows:
From the present terminus on Stanyan
street : down and out Fulton to Seventh
avenue, along that thoroughfare to Point
Lobos, and then a straight shoot to the
ocean. It is understood in Richmond that
work on the new line will begin in a few
days and be pushed rapidly to completion.
When this is done there will be four direct
lines to the ocean, three of which pass
through the district. â  The present road on
Seventh avenue, used only on Sundays,
will be widened to the electric gauge. -
The action of the Board of Supervisors
in stopping the sale of burial lots in the
three cemeteries which lie between Rich
mond district proper and the City has
aroused 'considerable ; - feeling among the
residents of -the former. There are many
who are anxious to abolish the cemeteries
altogether, and they regard the prohibi
tion of sales as a great victory. The par
tisans of the cemeteries, however, look at
the matter in a totally different light.
They claim V that the ordinance as passed
by the Supervisors is unconstitutional,
and they propose to test it in the courts; .
The Odd Fellows' Cemetery is probably
the least affected of any by the new order.
They had previously sold most of their old
lots, though it is understood that at the
very time of the Supervisors' unexpected
action they were negotiating for addi
tional territory. .-â¢ â¢
i* In spite of the fact that the Richmond
people welcome Sutro's road and look on
it ; as a kind of deliverance, they are un
qualifiedly opposed to : the high rate of
speed at which the cars are run. This is
particularly noticeable on Eighth avenue,"
where the â¢ cars attain an average speed of
eighteen miles ' an hour. This -is never
slackened when a crossing is reached. The
Point Lobos Club has appointed a com
mittee to wait * ; on the officials, and â¢ re
quest that the cars be, run at a rate con
sistent with I the safety of | pedestrians and
vehicles. â¢â .'.â â  '*.*<â  -â

The Catholic Champion Concludes His
Argument Against the Uni
tarian Divine.
Rev. Donald M. Ross sends the following
letter to The Call anent his controversy
with Father Yorke:
â¢ 004 Douglas Street, {
_, Sax Francisco. Feb. 7, 1896.
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sir: kindly
permit me to advise the readers of your valua
ble paper concerning a change which has been
made in regard to the place at which I shall set
forth my proofs of the four propositions upon
which I was challenged by Rev. P. C. Yorke.
The proofs will be presented at Metropolitan
Temple instead of at Woodward's Pavilion, as
heretofore announced. The change was deemed
advisable because of the central location of the
temple and the superior transportation facili
ties of its vicinity. Tickets sold . for the pa
vilion will call for seats in the temple in rela
tively the same positions as in the former
edifice.
Owing to the Impossibility of securing the
temple for the dates originally announced, a
slight change has been rendered necessary in
that particular and the proofs will be made
public from that platform on the four evenings
of February 24, 25, 20 and 27.
' 1 regret to learn that thus far no progress has
been made in the matter of selecting the third
lawyer to complete the board of judges. lam
anxious that this be done soon, in order that
the public may have an opportunity to become
satisfied of his impartiality, for my proofs are
all ready and they have sufficient local appli
cation to Interest and indeed to wholly con
vince both the Archbishop and the Chancellor
of the Archdiocese of the truth of the proposi
tions. â¢-
In closing this brief note permit me to thank
you for the uniform kindness and courtesy
with which you have always treated me and
the patriotic order of which I am a member,
and to express my utmost satisfaction in the
course recently adopted by State President
Hndelson in officially exploiting the position,
objects and principles of the American Pro
tective Association. It has been a bit of sur
piise that Peter Yorke, he of the facile pen,
has not attempted a word in opposition. Per
haps the popular impression as to the cause of
his silenceâ that he knows the principles of the
A. P. A. are unimpeachableâ the correct ex
planation of his ignominious retreat. Very
respectfully, D.21. Ross. "
FATHER YORKE AGAIN.
Resumes His Argument on the Sub
ject of the "Primacy of St. Peter,"
Replying to Dr. Wendte? ?-
Continuing his letter commenced in
yesterday's Call on the subject of "The
Primacy of St. Peter," Rev. Father , Yorke
says: , . .// r . i', : /\,^i. ,/â 
Cyprian, In the same century, writes :
"Peter, on whom the church had been built
by the Lord, speaking one for all and answer
ing in the name of the church, says: 'Lord, to
whom shall we go**" "
In order not to extend this letter indefinitely
I will give Hergenroether's answer to Janus'
assertion:
"That the prerogatives bestowed on Peter
were transmitted to his successors, and that
those successors are the Roman Pontiffs, is a
truth so clearly proclaimed by tradition that
even the Galileans have never called it in ques
tion. When, in the interpretation of these
texts, the fathers inquire into the primacy of
Peter, they characterize ! it as a permanent in
stitution. Further, when they speak of the
Roman Bishop, for the time being, they say of
him that he "occupies the See of Peter,' 'He
sits in the chair of Peter.' 'Peter lives and
works in him,"'ln him he feedeth all the Lord's
sheep.' Have .they not, then,; herein: given
sufficient evidence of their conviction?
"As Christ said to his disciples, "He that
heareth you heareth me,' so the fathers ex
claim, 'Whoso heareth the Bishop of Rome
heareth Peter.' Bishop Possessor writes to
Pope Hormisdas as follows: 'From whom is
the strengthening of vacillating faith more to
be looked for than from the Bishops of that
See whose first occupant heard from Christ
those words, 'Thou | art Peter, and upon "this
rock will I build my church ?' Leo the Great
says: 'The firmness of that faith which was
raised in the Prince of Apostles is always en
during; and in the same way as what Peter
believed in Christ, to wit, His divinity lasts
forever; so that. which Christ ordained in
Peter, to wit, his primacy and its invincible
"power, lasts forever. Thus the ordinance of
truth ever abides;. Peter , perseveres in the
rock-like strength conferred on him, and al
ways holds the helm of the church intrusted
to his care. This,' says Leo, further, 'is even at
present the case aud even in an unworthy heir
this dignity has not ceased to exist.' So even
now the flock (according to John xxi: 17, 18)
is still led by Peter, who conflrmeth his suc
cessor and prayeth for him.
" 'What Peter has received,' says Leo's pre
decessor, Sixtus 111, 'that he has transmitted to
his successors.'. In the same way Gelasius de
rives the ore-eminence of the Roman church
directly from the words of Christ addressed to
Peter. Theodore the Studite calls the Roman
See the See of the Coryphaeus, the See in which
Christ bas deposited the keys of faith. And
already before him, Sergius the Metropolitan of
Cyprus, addressed ; Pope Theodore, O * Holy
Head. Christ" our God hath destined thine
Apostolic See to be an immovable foundation
and a pillar of the faith. For thou art, as the
divine word truly saith, Peter, and on thee as a
foundation stone have the pillars of the church
been fixed.'
"The writings of the fathers, whenever they
speak of the Pope, are full of echoes and allu
sions to those Scripture words, and what is said
of Peter, the Popes claim decidedly for them
selves. The church, as well as the Peter or
rock on which it was founded, passes for invin
cible. If some fathers call faith the foundation
of the church, they take that faith," not in the
abstract sense, but concretely, understanding
it to be living faith of Peter, which was the rea
son why he was chosen to be the foundation
stone of the church. Hence, theologians say the
faith of Peter is the cause why his person is form
ally the basis of the church. "Not on his confes
sion,* says Doellinger, 'but on account of his con
fession must the church be founded on
him. A man with a rock-like firmness
of character; ; for the ; church, v as it
consists of .persons, of t living beings,
needed then as it needs now a living personal
foundation. - As the edifice of the church is one
destined to endure for all time,' so this pre
eminence of Peter, which with him as the
foundation necessarily - holds - the * church to
gether, necessarily passes to others after him
by wav of transmission. The power of binding
and of loosing was indeed imparted to all the
apostles (Matthew. xvi'i:lÃ), but only after
Peter and on tbe presupposition of his primacy.
Next, it was bestow ed upon them ' altogether
but. first of all granted ,to Peter alone. The
keys of the kingdom of heaven, too, were given
to him only. Janus, indeed, asserts in contra
diction to Doellinger- that it is against all
Patristic. interpretation and the 'evangelical
tradition of the church to explain the power of
the keys as something differing from, that of
binding and" loosing. But, independently of
the fact that this cxegetical tradition is by no
means constant and universal; one prerogative
ci Peter above the other .apostles lies in. the
extent of his power and . in ; its degrees. = The
keys of tbe kingdom of heaven denote the high
est spiritual authority. . ,v V
Such, Mr. Editor, .-. is the '; answer :to Dr.
Wendte's -. two new . objections. Like the old
ones, they will not hold water." ; It is true be
tells a" story about a certain f Father Finnegan
who landed the bark of Peter on a rock and
left her there. ,- 1 don't know that there is any
thing more Incongruous in that performance
than in Noah's casting anchorage on Mount
Ararat., Anyhow, Dr. *VÂ»endta only Introduces
the story to enliven the discussion, and' I am
greatly afraid s that Father Finnegan belongs
to the me category as Dr. Wendte's theological
tailor and his mythical cook. v-:i~i . t- .vi.;..
The argument from the rock still stands.
Nothing that Dr. Wendte has brought against
it has weakened its cogency. For 1500 years
no other interpretation was known to Chris
tendom. It was only when men had cast off"
the yoke of the church and were determined
to wrest the Scriptures i to : their, own destruc
tion that they undertook to distort the words
of the Lora. But all in vain. ; Common-sense
shames them. Heaven and earth pass away,
but Christ's words do not. pass away: "Thou
art Peter Â«nd upon this rock will I build my
church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it." Â£â /:â "â  " .-7- : -7 :- ; -^-* : ' ? l, ?-'"7> '; â "'â ?;'-
'â ' THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM. 7;?
I had explained that the keys of a' kingdom
were among the Orientals a symbol of supreme
power," just as -the crown * and ; scepter - are
among, us. 'When, therefore, A Christ said to
Peter,* "To thee do I give the keys of the king
dom: of heaven," he conferred ; on St. Peter
supreme power in his church. â 
Against this argument Dr. Wendte has noth
ing to say. .- - â¢'?SfeÃ_3^l^^?"i*SS&'3" : - ?ifi-l : ~" ; ; -
'"" TOE POWER OF BINDING AND LOOSING.
The expression to bind and , to loose a
common one among the .Jews. It. meant
legislative power. - Hence when it is given to
Peter it signifies that he is the lawgiver lor the
whole church.
Dr. . Wendte objected that this power was
given to all the apostles as well as to Peter,
and therefore that each individual possesses it
as well as Peter. Â: - a X :
I admitted tbat the legislative power was
given to the whole church, Peter included. .
I denied that it was given personally to each
believer. One might as reasonably suppose
that each member of Congress has power to
make laws because he belongs to a legislative
body. Christ made the church a legislative
body be did not make each member capable of
passing laws alone. V
I noted, however, that Christ singled out
Peter and gave to him personally the power be
gave the church. He alone was given supreme
legislative authority because Christ had made
him head of the church.
To this argument Dr. Wendte only answered
that I was nmnipulating scripture. -
Fourthâ The commission to confirm the
brethren.
From the words of Christ at the Last Supper
by which St. Peter was singled out from the
eleven and prayed for by name and commis
sioned to "confirm his brethren. 1 drew the
natural conclusion that Peter was invested by
Christ with an extraordinary power over the
other disciples. â¢â¢â  â 'â >-â - i
Dr. Wendte, with a logical acumen charac
teristic of Oakland scholarship, auotes Janus
to show that the text does not prove the infal
libility of the Pope. I suppose I must inform
Dr. Wendte that the authority of the Pope and
the infallibility of the Pope are two very dif
ferent things. I undertook to demonstrate
that Peter had received an extraordinary
authority over tho disciples. Dr. Wendte re
torts the Pope is not infallible. Truly, the
ways of Oakland scholarship are wonderful.
But let us see what there is in Dr. Wendte's
quotation.
â¢ "Every one knows the one classical passage
of Scripture on which the edifice of Papa , in
fallibility has been raised: 'I have prayed
for thee,' that thy faith fail not, and when thou
art converted confirm thy Â brethren.' But
these words manifestly refer only to Peter per
sonally, to his denial of Christ and to his con
version; he is told that he whose failure of
faith would be of short duration . is to
strengthen the other Apostles, whose faith
would likewise waver. ' It is directly against
the sense of the passage, which speaks simply
of faith, first wavering, and then to be con
firmed in the Messianic dignity of Christ,
to find in it a promise of future infallibility to
a succession of Popes, just because they hold
the office Peter first held in the Roman church.
No single writer to the end of the seventh cen
tury dreamed of such an interpretation; all
without exceptionâ and there are eiahteen of
explain it simply as a prayer of Christ
that his Apostle might not wholly succumb,
and lose his faith entirely in his approaching
trial." - (Janus p. 74-75.)
Dr. Wendte quotes these as Doellinger' s sen
timents. How accurate he and his authorities
are may be learned from the following quota
tion frpm*"Hergenroether*s Anti-janus, p. 59. %
"But the promise of Christ, letted by the
infalliblists, their opponents will not admit,' at
least not to an equal degree. The passage in
Luke xxii:32 applies, according to Janus,' to
Peter personally, to nis denial and his conver
sion. This, however, Catholic theologians
deny. No matter how the word 'epistrepsas'
(converted) may be explained, ' still the essen
tial unity between the [special occasion, and
the significance of Christ's word of promise,
embracing, as it does, all times, may
be easily established.' 'The See of Peter,' ob
serves Doellinger, "was to remain a place of
truth, a citadel of firm faith, conducing to the
strength of all; for the words as well as the
prayers of our Lord were addressed not merely
to the individual person,' and for the imme
diate moment, but they were meant to lay an
enduring foundation; their significance was,
above all, for the church and for her future
needs, which Christ beheld in spirit.'
. "When Janus further observes that not a
single doctor of the church, down to the end
of the seventh century, has given the inter
pretation of this text disputed by him, are,
therefore, the passages of later popes aud of
Western teachers, are therefore the -splendid
testimonies of the later Greeks, such as the
Patriarch John VI of Constantinople (anno
715), St. Theodore the Studite (anno 826), ana i
the exeeetist Theophylactus of Achrida,
robbed of their weight? But it is not even
true, as our opponent repeatedly states, that
the first to give this interpretation was Pope
Agatho in 680, when trying to avert the
threatened condemnation of his predecessor,
Honorius.'
f "The same interpretation had on the Bth ot
October, 649, been put forward in Rome by
Bishop Stephen of Dora, the envoy of 8. So
phronius, Bishop of Jerusalem, and before him
by the Popes Gelasuis, Pelaguis II and Gregory
the Great, and before these again by the great
Leo. So exceedingly trustworthy are the state
ments of our Janus I *
i Fifthâ commission to feed the lambs and
sheep. â¢'â  >-'-" â ;*-â â 
Christ gave Peter a threefold commission to
feed his lambs and sheep. This commission
implies supreme power over the.sheepfold,
which is Christ's church. ; .*â¢...,
Dr. Wendte's answer to this argument is
sublime. He cannot break the force, of the
commission, so he calmly takes his scissors and
cuts the whole incident out of the Scripture.* .
| "In the opinion of most scholars of the mod
ern critical school this whole passage (John
xxi:l6) is palpably ungenuine. I The fourth
gospel ends naturally with the last verse of
chapter XX. The last chapter is evidently an
appendix later added to the fourth gospel in
order to counteract its glorification of the" be
loved disciple and to < make Peter appear as
the chief apostle." -, -
To this let me add that the critical argu
ments for the authenticity of the; last chapter
are precisely the i same as. J the critical argu
ments for the rest of the gospel. It is found in
all codices and it is quoted by the earliest
fathers of the church. I Even supposing that it
bas not been written by John, it is as old as
the fourth gospel. Moreover it is | the j natural
complement of the gospel. It is an epilogue,
built on the same plan as the prologue. j As an
historical account it carries just as much
weight as the other chapters, and as an histor
ical account I consider it now.
Certainly, Dr. Wendte must be determined
to down St. Peter when he is willing to sacri- â¢
lice St. John. , ...
'. These, Mr. Editor, are the arguments I pro
duced to prove the primacy of St. Peter and
these are the answers Dr. Wendte made to the
arguments. *" Let me consider now the objec
tions he made to the fact of the primacy itself
from other portions of the Scripture. These
objections may be reduced to two: -.-; v j = v
(1.) The church was; a. pure democracy and,
therefore, there was no room fora primacy. '"
I (2.) The early history of the church shows no

on addressing *mci as "good" Father Yorke.
though there is a similar' prohibition against
calling any one ".'good" except God. -. <- ..

(I Cor. iv:l4). * â¢; v â . * >. ?i
â¢ Anyhow whatever may be tbe meaning of

question. ; Dr. .Wendte is trying to prove that

words addressed to the multitude. s What these
words inculcate is the virtue of humility, and
that not in the case of the pastors of the church
in particular, but upon all our Lord's followers.
; Moreover, I quoted from other parts Of the
Scripture," a showing . that I immediately ; after
ascension ': the I church was * organized on a

answer in cultured and elegant phrase that I
have a "diarrhoea of words." ;" Â« â â¢'.- *:' v
â  (2) Peter's prominence.
* Dr. Wendte asserted that there was . no trace
of Peter's primacy in the early history of the
church. This assertion becomes untenable in
the face of > the fact- that in " the Acts of the
Apostles I'eter is the foremost of the apostles;
that he proposes the election of a new member
of the Sacred ; college; that he ; was the first to
speak after Pentecost; that his name is always
mentioned first; tbat |he| is sent on * the most

pretensions to learning are on our side. * Some

Dr. Wendte replies that he is appalled at the
virulence of my verbosity, or as he calls it, my
"cacoethes loquendi."
'. CONCLUSION.
In this review of the first part of the contro
versy I have tried to set forth the arguments on
both sides. That Dr. Wendte does not make a
better showing arises solely from the fact that
he preferred to waste valuable space in telling
silly stories about Father Finnegans instead of
meeting my arguments. I do not care to fol
low his example and let my pencil run riot in
advisiug him not to attempt intellectual pur
suits or in informing him that he is behind the
age or impressing on him that he is engaged
in a lost cause or in . inditing similar humbug
gery. I wish to be judged not by what I say of
myself, but by my arguments. I have sum
marized them as accurately as I could, and to
morrow I hope -to do the same for the second
part of the controversy or the dispute about
church and state. "- " * P. C. Yorke.

role of handsome, dashing Hendrick Hud
son Jr. Her sinuous, rhythmic ; dancing,
especially the grace and abandon of the
Spanish dances, won stalls and gallery
alike. 7
The newsboys were out in force. An
hour before the performance they were
standing six abreast at the entiance to the
California, the "line extending into the
street, and when the , doors \ were opened
they surged , into the gallery in less time
than it takes to tell it.
All guarded the souvenir photographs
bearing â  Corinne's autograph and ; the
pamphlets containing a sketch of her life
and poems dedicated to her as they would
their lives, ' and carried them home as
treasure trove. 7
The following dedication greatly pleased
them: ~-7?^7.?,---.- - ... ....

her sympathy for the poor and' her great

With the exception of one evening

when the Rev. Charles A. Ramm of St.
Mary's Cathedral made his first public ap
pearance in this City.. The exception, of
course, was when the Rev. Peter C. Yorke
delivered ah address before the union.
Father Ramm proved to be an attractive
central figure, in whom quite a general in
terest was shown by Catholic people. | The
fame of his scholarly attainments in the
REV. CHARLES A. RAMM.
[From a photograph.]
University of California, and later in the
Catholic University in Washington, D.C.,
had preceded him, and among the more
enthusiastic participants in the present
intellectual^movement there .were many
who desired to see and hear him. ; Only a
few years ago Father, Ramm, then an in
dustrious student in the University of
California, went; -over, to ;- : the Catholic
church ; with one of - his ; professors, Dr.
Greene, who occupied the chair of botany
there.:
- Every seat was taken last % night ;in
Metropolitan Hall and large numbers of
people with tickets seemed quite satisfied
to find standing room in the aisles, while
Father Ramm delivered a lecture on "The
Reunion of Christendom. .
The speaker did not impress - his audi
ence so deeply with eloquence or oratory
as he did with his earnestness and the
able treatment of his subject. He said: -v.*?
; Certainly one of the most striking character
istics of the Christian world to-day is* the very
general desire for; reunion. .The 'same -.spirit
which brought s progressive order and . unity
out of the warring elements of the primal
chaos seems to be work ing, to-day in the hearts
of Christian men and women to bring j about a
higher order and unity in the realm of â  Chris
tian thought and life. .The babel of discord
antrvoices which has so long been the lament
of the followers of Christ and the mockery of
their enemies, appears -to be : surely, if very
slowly, melting into a massive harmony. , "â .iC
I He held that the -sighs of this slow
change are iin the very air. Eastern
schismatics are returning to their mother
church, there ! are , rumors of reunion be
tween the Latin and. Greek churches, and
the Church of England -.has ; . of late years
looked longingly toward recognition- by
the communions of the East. Continuing
in this strain the sneaker said: : -
The Clerical = Unionâ a very earnest and in
fluential body *in i the Established Church,
headed by Lord Halifaxâ has for its avowed
object to effect the corporate reunion of. the
Anglican church with the â  Church of Rome.
Animated by the spirit of Christ that there
might be one fold and one shepherd, our holy
father Pope Leo XIII, who J has > done : so much
for good will among men, has within the past
year addressed a touching letter on reunion to
the English people, and not long before an
other on the same subject to_the entire Chris
tian world. *â 'â¢' - â  -i? -.,-â¢"-'â â¢-.- Â-.-' :v::
â 'â â  These incidents," .'he remarked, argued
the existence of a deep-seated add wide
spread longing for â unity. He '. quoted
various reasons for this* longing as a sense
Â°* .;, the nee d of (i unity among earnest
Christians against antagonistic and solvent
forces which are either 1 ' anti-religious or
anti-moral, .or merely, negative. Again
prejudices, which for centuries â¢ erected
walls ; of ' division t ' between the different
sects* of Christianity, are gradually dis
appearing, and there is * a? growing" 'con
viction among Christians that there ought
to be unity ;that Christ made his church
one, and meant it should \ always j remain
so. T. ' " ' ' y;y- ". ' ' â  -v
' Among evangelicals v. the * same ; signs are
visible. -The Methodists and Presbyterians In
Canada have partially . healed their family
quarrel. The old ' and new . school ' Presby
â Â»â¢_ lin this country ? reunited in ; 1869.'
(Schaff.) â â  \\U .'/-^r-ii-; \-t . â â >::â  '.-â '-- '-,â :â :
.r Perhaps, too, as a sign of the desire for re
union we may cite > the late parliament of ; re
ligions, although it |is obvious that other mo
lives--besides a yearning for -unity aided in
â¢bringing about that heterogeneous gathering.
+ l n ' his ? argument s Father Ratrim? held
that Christ's . church is an organism.
Christ had â¢ a 'plan â  whereby his purpose
might carried out; he chose his ** apos
tles, who were I a corporate | body and ) re
garded themselves as an organized society,
to which was committed, in a special way,
the mission of their Master. The church
founded by Christ, then, was an organized
body, having one head; ? the unity there
]Â°* c , w *? 3 organic unity. It is obvious that
Christ s; command to "teach all things
whatsoever I have commanded you?* * *
I am with you all. days,' even to the con
summation of the world," would be Im
possible of execution lif the unity of spirit,
the unity of truth, which s Christ 'gave his
apostles were destroyed. They t might
teach all things; they could not teach all.
Regarding infallibility he said: "
â¢?Â«H! n Â»Kl all ' th, ?g-" are." brought to their
â¢1 , Â«â¢ e Rostleg' can -teach them as they
Â»fi^? mman _? d t0 do.* But the Holy Ghost
will bring nothing false to their minds. There
fore, in teaching all things which -were com-"
,*^ a ? de 2; th fcm Â» they must teach infallibility.
And -this, infallibility, exercised within - its
proper field and insured by the Holy Ghost, is
tne permanent living principle of unity in the
CuUrCh. â .'â ->>>:*.;. â â '-.-.â ;. ;'<; .â  = ;..Â«- \-.< -â  --}.Â»< .Â«. :.-'â . â¢â '-;;.-.'. -..-
After dwelling at considerable length oh
doctrinal and theological views of the sub
ject the lecturer came to "j schemes of â > re
union. :i He j saw; but ?! one .'Â«j conclusion-
Christendom must reunite in 7 the Roman
church. She alone is one organism, hay
ing a visible head and visible .members.
She alone even professes that infallibility
which Father Ramm showed to have been
logically *. involved in the *â  command ; to
teach revealed truth. She C alone j, is held
together, by. .this j living.principle of unity.'
In a word, she alone possesses the features
of the church .which' Christ founded in the
beginning. , . - .. â¢ , * Â
The basis for, organic reunion ? between
the Catholic church on the one hand and
the Greek' and Protestant denominations
on * the other areâ first, compromise, and
second, submission, individual or corpo
rate.'>Â» Compromise i was \ ' si: own *"": to be im
possible, since; the Catholic church cannot
make concessions in matters of doctrine.
So there g remains only submission to I the
Catholic church. -This' sounds harsh and
tyrannical, but it is not so, for submission
is simniy submission to Christ's .? church.
The speaker concluded in these words:
â¢v; Practically what arc we to do? Our duty lies
in the present." First, let us on both sides try
to understand each other's beliefs. Let us be
as unbiased as possible in appreciating the
tenets of those who differ from us.i Let us give
one another | credit for ; honesty, sincerity and
virtue where these are not evidently wanting.
Then let us insist more upon our common her
itage; on those things, wherein we agree and
lesson those wherein -we differ. The contro
versial spirit, I am .persuaded, belongs to the
past, the expositive and constructive! to -the
present t and the | future. The body of I truth
which all of us possess in common provides us
naturally with- a common standpoint from
which to look out upon the fiela wherein our
differences lie. ' But evidently the more nearly
identical the position from which we severally
regard;, this t field the ; more likely will be the
vanishing of these differences.
Â£ Secondlyâ We must live |as - nearly perfect
Christian lives as possible. B The apprehension
and acceptance of religious truth is a moral
matter, and therefore obviously depends very
much upon our personality. The same cvi-
dence .which convinced and " converted the
thousands in Jerusalem failed to convert the
Pharisees. It is only upon condition that we
endeavor to use all the light God gives us that
we may.with any assurance look to him for
more. "The clean of heart shall see God." |
Let this pure life manifest and exercise itself
in works of Christian charity, done, as near
ly as possible, in -the' humble, sacrificing
spirit of the Master. It was the worksâ the
almsâ of Cornelius, "held in remembrance in
: the , sight of God," ,which â¢ brought him - the
grace of conversion - and - admission unto the
unity of the fold with Peter. -â,-. Â". â 
r Lastly, our . greatest dnty is prayer." We are
to become one body with Christ and members
of one another. It . is only by the indwelling
of his life in us that this intimate, supernatu
ral religion can exist. -.That life in us is grace,
and grace he will. not give us unless we ask it.
The more of that grace we possess the more do
we share his. own life, which he possesses in
common with the Father. Praying for his life
in us, for union with him, therefore, we shall
be breathing his own prayer for usâ "And not
for them only do I pray but for them also who
through ; their word shall believe in me, that
they i ail may be one as thou, i Father, in 'me
and I in thee, that they also may be one in us."
"And there shall be one fold and one shep
herd."

raging. It was only a month ago that, he
was released, and he lost no time in setting

Horses "With; False .Tails.
There are perhaps half a dozen horses in
New York that have false tails. -The horse
so provided is generally a fine animal, per
haps a gne carriage horse. It may have
been provided by nature with a poor tail,
or it may have lost its own flowing tail in
a fire. It is easy to get a tail to match. A
small portion of hide is ; removed with the
tail,' and when this has been cured the tail
is provided with straps and buckles on the
under side to hold it to the tail -. of the
horse that is to wear it, : and the ; hide at
tached is stitched to the crupper of the
horse's harness. The fact that the ' tail -is
false would not be discovered" except upon
close and careful inspection. The tail is
taken off with the harness.
. Horses are ; occasionally provided with
false manes in the same general manner,
and sometimes with false ears.â New York

OF CITIZENSHIP
Wong Kirn Ark's Case the
United States Supreme
Court. -
SHALL ; CHINESE VOTE?
District Attorney Foote's Message
From the Attorney-Gen- 3 .
eral.
â¢
ADVANCED ON THE CALENDAR.
I ââ  nWI
California and the Federal Law De
partment Join Issue on an Im
portant Question.
United States District Attorney Foote
received a communication from Attorney-
General Harmon yesterday informing him
that the case of Wong Kirn Ark had been
advanced on the Supreme Court's calendar,
and would probably be heard some time
in April.
This is big news for California. It
means, practically, that there is a strong
probability of Judge Morrow's decision in
the Wong Kirn Ark case being overruled,
and the edict pronounced that a Chinese
born in this country is not therefore a
citizen. "*-7\7':?' â â 'â 'â â 
The Wong Kirn Ark was a test case
argued in the United States District Court
in this City. The United States District
Attorney took the ground, in this case,
that the son of Chinese parents, although
born in this country, could not become a
citizenâ or rather that he was not, by
reason of his birth in this country, a citi
zen thereof.
Judge Morrow ruled otherwise, but in
his decision he followed a precedent estab
lished by Justice Field while sitting on the
Circuit bench in this circuit, and did not,
in a measure, exercise his own judicial
judgment in the matter. The effect of
Judge Morrow's decision* was, however, to
uphold the view tbat had already been
taken and acted upon by the Chinese at
the prior elections, under which the mem
bers of the Chinatown "Parlor" of Native
Sons of the Golden State (an incorporated
society) and other sons of Chinese parents
sought to cast their ballots on an equal basis
with American citizens. In truth. Judge
Morrow's ruling wss that the sole test of
citizenshipâ the question of naturalization
apartâ lies in the question of birth. If
Wong Kirn Ark * was born in the United
States, no matter what his parentage, he
was a citizen of the United States.
But this ruling has by no means settled
the question. It was, in truth, merely, a'
technical ruling on a test case and action
was taken in the lower court at the in
stance of the United â¢ States Attorney-
Gv-Aeral for the purpose of bringing the
action squarely before the Supreme
Court of the United Slates.
It is a question of vast importance and
one that has never before been defined by
the Supreme Court of the United States,
though that tribunal has on more than
one occasion expounded- the law at vari
ance with the Field and the Morrow de
cisions. /n;~"??' '
The question at issue is not one that
affects American-born Chinese alone, but
every American-born son of foreign-born
father who did not become a naturalized
citizen of this country prior to the time
when the son arrived at maturity. In this
view of the case one sees at a glance that
many thousands of voter, all over the
United States are deeply interested in the
knotty legal problem, though of course
should the United States Supreme Court
reverse the ruling of Judge Morrow, as it
is confidently expected that it will, the
American-born Chinese will be the only
ones to be ultimately deprived of citizen-
ship. Sons of non-naturalized Caucasians
will merely have to secure naturalization
in the ordinary way. But the Mongolians,
while the existing Chinese restriction laws
are in force, will be forever barred from
citizenship. " : 7/7; ? ? 7 7 , v 7?
The question involved is a fundamental
one, and the progress of the * case â  will be
watched with great interest .by , the entire
legal profession.' It was originally brought
to the front by the very carefully prepared
articles "of Attorney George D. Collins of
tbis City, 7 which were published in the
American Law Review. ...
In these* essays Mr. Collins took what
was first considered rather, the novel posi
tion that the fourteenth"* amendment to
the constitution does not,* by its language,
confer citizenship upon all who are Â§ born
in this country. . He cited that rortion ': of
the amendment which 7 reads: "All
persons born or naturalized in the United
States, and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof."
The latter words, ''in the - jurisdiction
thereof," Mr. Collins maintained? did not
refer to the territorial jurisdiction (as was
proven by the? fact that territorial in
habitants* were not citizens), but to
political . jurisdiction. And 3in sTde
ciding- the question of political â  juris
diction international usage ' and" not
the English common .law' 1 ; should
be ' the guide .to the interpretation
of the amendment. He showed that citi
zenship in England was radically different
from citizenship in the - United Statesâ '.
which would seem" to the layman to be not
a very difficult taskâ and then argued (with
such ability as to attract the attention of
Attorney-General Olhey) ; that when the
rule of 7 * political 7 jurisdiction "7; was
thus applied to the sons of foreign-born
fathers who were not : naturalized these
same sons must be considered without the
jurisdiction 7 of , the United State's, ;v and
therefore,* not ipso facto, â¢: by birth alone,
citizens of the United States. This is only
the briefest kind of statement of the entire
argument. The entire; argument was, of
course, mainly directed against the native-,
born Chinese t who for several years past
have been voting in this ana other States
under the \ Field I decision, and who had
also been landing at this port from * China
on the plea of : having been born in this
country. '- : ???"-â  "'fi 7/ /â¢". ;7?'-?t*;7'?
Attorney-General Olney was greatly im
pressed with the latter state of facts and
sent a special commissioner ;to San Fran
cisco to examine into the matter. This ;
commissioner found that large" - numbers of
Chinese were landing here (before the reg
istration act was en forced) upon? 'thV plea
of citizenship. Upon his report to tbe
"Washington authorities Attorney-General
Harmon, the successor of Mr. Olney, in
struct ed the United States District Attor-
ney,to bring such action in the case as
would bring the entire question of citizen
ship before the Supreme Court of. the
United States. . ..'"
United States District Attorney Foote
in arguing the case . before Judge Morrow
took much the same grounds as that as
sumed by Attorney Collins, and Mr. Col
lins ; himself was : requested to appear in
the case as amicus curiae. Attorney-Gen-;
eral Harmon .'â  in the . coming issue before
the Supreme Court will take this argument
and urge that the mere fact of birth in the
United States does not entitle to citizen
ship.. He has requested, also, that Mr.
Collins appear and repeat his argument
before the court. Mr. Collins has con
sented and: will in due time take his de
parture for Washington. ... .â _.?-â  ;
There is a movement on foot, as "well, to
have the State of California represented in
the great issue, and it is expected that
Governor Budd will name a local attorney
for that task. 7^^ 77^7 -Â»??
The fact that the case has been advanced
on the Supreme Court calendar is deemed
of the utmost importance, for this reason :
If it were held over till the fall term there
is every probability that the Supreme
Court would decide the particular case at
issue not upon a" strict construction of the
law, as is desired, but upon the grounds of
expediency, a course that, in view of the
approaching . Presidential election, the
bench would be justified in adopting. For
if the case were decided against the Chinese
thousands of native-born Americans :of
foreign parentage would be disfranchised
at the coming election; because the time
would be insufficient to permit 1 them to
become naturalized citizen?.
MUSICIANS DO GOOD WORK
Second Concert . by ? the ; New San
Francisco Symphony Or

Semi-Classical.. Music Receives an
Excellent Renderingâ Colvard's
Solo.
Another excellent concert was given yes
terday afternoon in Golden Gate .Hall, by
the San Fraucisco Symphony Orchestra.
The programme was a* popular* oneâ that
is to say, did not contain a symphony,
but ! there were popular selections from
such composers as Wagner. Handel, Schu
bert, Chopin, Dvorak \ and Delibes and
operatic excerpts by Bizet and Flotow. .
Schubert's "Marche Milltaire," arranged
by the conductor of the orchestra, J. H.
Howe, was used as the opening number.
Like all the other selections, it was played
conscientiously 1 and .'artistically,, and
aroused the applause of a critical audience.
The transcription ; from* "Martha" was
rendered crisply and with spirit. 'Hack
neyed as the old airs are? they' never fail,
when well performed,, to have an enliven
ing effect upon all but bigoted opponents
of tuneful operas of the older school.
Yesterday. the listeners were evidently not
composed of the "straightest sect" of the
Wagnerian cult,", for they encored the
transcription from "Martha" with effusion.
It would nave added a spice of variety to
the ever lovely "Prize Song" if J. H. Howe
had sought out some tenor capable of sing
ing it in a manner not wholly displeasing
to neople who do not care to I see Wagner
trifled with. It may be that he did seek;
if so he did not' find, for Walther's song
was given with Bernhard Mollenhauer's
violin as the solo voice. Mr. Mollenhauer
shines most" in pieces demanding 5 florid
execution;" but he put considerable feeling
into his cantabi'e and was ably assisted by
.the other first violins. - '.-â > - *.Â« c
Delibes' waltz, "Naila,". was so warmly
applauded that it was necessary to repeat
it. Chopin's* "Military Polonaise," Dvo
rak's â â¢ "Slavish Dance" No. 1 and : the
"Toreador", from "Carmen" were all well
played and received much applause. * One
of the hits of the afternoon was I made by
W. H. Colvard's trombone j concerto - with
the orchestra. 'He played a : work . : by
Graefe in a way that revealed the resources
of 'his r instrument. v "The Mill" (for
strings), by Gillet,' was delicately rendered
by the orchestra. â â¢',',
--f "Mrs. Birmingham, the vocal soloist of
the concert, sang "0, Thou That Tellest,"
from the '-Messiah," and a couple of songs
by d'Hardelot
It is impossible to speak in too . much
praise of the enterprise and public spirit
of the musicians in organizing , the San
Francisco g Symphony ; Orchestra. The
class of people who have wealth enough to
support such 'an organization ; seems, to
have resolved to let music severely alone
this winter, and the j musicians, in them
selves organizing a 'symphony orchestra,
have taken a departure which should 5 win
them the enthusiastic support of every
music-lover in the City. *" ; .â â â¢* .

phony orchestra- takes place next Friday

She Brought a Cargo of Coal for the
? North Pacific Coast Rail
way. .^
The inhabitants of Sausalito are jubilant.
They are now satisfied that their city is" an
integral part of the greatest seaport "on the
west coast of North g America. For? the
first time in the history of the place there
is now accommodation for the docking of
deep-water ships, and yesterday one of the
ships went alongside the bunkers recently
erected by the North Pacific Coast Rail
road. She is not the largest vessel in port,
but still she carries 2400 tons of coal, and
1400 v tons of that' quantity are being dis
charged at Sausalito?? :: â¢' ' '/y/
. â '. It was a proud day for the city across the
bay when the? British ship Wynnstay, in
tow of ' the ; tug Rescue, came up to the
dock. The depth of water was ample, and
The British Ship Wynnstay Discharging the First Cargo of Coal Ever Landed From a Deep-Water
Vessel at a Sausalito Wharf.
Captain George Harvey had no trouble in
getting the , vessel into her berth. An
hour later the booms had been rigged and
the work 'of discharging the cargo was
begun at : once. ''Many and many a ship
have I towed - to Sausalito," said Captain
Harvey, "but they all came to this point
because there was a safe anchorage. That
would be during the times when freights
were low, and owners would sooner tie up
the ; ships than accept what was offering.
This is the first time? however, that I have
actually docked a' foreign ship, or, for that
matter, any other ship at a Sausalito
wharf.".
] The .Wynnstay is docked not. ten yards
away from the landing 'of the Sausalito
ferry. v All the passengers inspect her
before leaving the waiting-rooms 'â '; and
Captain McÃryde is beginning to feel more
proud of his vessel owing to the attention
the inhabitants of -Sausalito are giving to
her.* It is now a customary thing for the
youths and maidens to walk to the ship,
go aboard and inspect her at their leisure.
During the workinc hours there is always
a crowd watching the big buckets as , they
carry their tons of coal from the hold of
the ship to the bunkers. .'*'â â '-*.
. The North Pacific Coast Railroad Com
pany is .7 going to use coal on its road
instead of wood, so the Wynnstay will not
be the last deep-water ship that will dock
at j Sausalito. ; The company has erected
two bunkers with a capacity of 1400 tons
and these will be kept constantly filled, so
there will be, a constant succession of
vessels carrying coals from Newcastle.
I The Wynnstay made the run from New
castle, Austtalia, in sixty-three days, and
'she brought her cargo :to R. B. Hogue,
who sold it to the railroad company.

; Yesterday was -the first free day at the
Mark Hopkins Institute of Art, and fully
! 1500 visitors, four-fifths 7of â¢ whom â¢ were
women and the rest men and children, in
spected the interior of the house and the
treasures of art there displayed. ,7
-, . As announced in The Call exclusively a
few weeks â  ago, Mr? Searles, who 7 reserved ;
in his deed â of * trust certain rights in the
management of the institute, suggested to
the trustees' that visitors should be admit-,
ted free of ' charge one day and evening of
each month. Accordingly the' board of
trustees declared , the first ; Friday of each
"month? a free 5 day. Yesterday being : the
first?* Friday â¢in 1 February, the house ' was
open to all, yet the managers of the insti
tute took good '; care that =as little public
notice as possible of the event should be
given. , The reason assigned for not adver
tising the free day was that a multitude of
visitors would interfere with* the > work of
preparation y for i the * MardiGras ball. So !
many people, however, ,' had * read The
Call's announcement last month of a free
day that the institute was crowded with
spectators from morning until night.
The 7 decorators 7 ( bad 7to â â :â  suspend ? work
and * the i pupils were Zi obliged, to aban- :
don tbeir Q studies ,; for % the '*-. day. The
throng not only surged through ; the nu
merous and spacious rooms and galleries
of the great building, but invaded the art
school on the same lot. The life, the an ;
â  tique, the still life >? and \-. the 7 ; modeling
â¢ classes . were "- in Â«; session. Spectators
handled the still-life subjects -much to the
amazement of "j pupils. One Â§ young f lady,
was drawing from a human 7 skull when
the object was seized â  by a curious spec
tator, who essayed to Â£ explain tbe 'i forma
tion of the skull to his friends with him.
During the explanation*! the jaw of -the.
skull dropped to '.the floor. .-,--;
* â¢ Curious "visitors * invaded the boys' life
class and retreated at the first sight of the
model. - The girl's life class .'.* was also in
vaded, although the '* sign "No Admit
tance" was displayed on the door. 7" ' â¢'
One old lady said to the doorkeeper. "I
am so glad that Mr. " Searles i has given a
free day." It was so kind of him. I am
going to come every free day." ,Â». ,
The fact was observed that very many of
the visitors were elegantly/dressed ladies,
who wore silks of the finest quality and
diamonds/ and jewels and laces. â¢ 4 The
childreu and , grown people inspected the
house from top to bottom. They went as
high in the "tower ,as they could get and
peered into every nook and corner of the
palace. . 7> " ''. *.', *

; Judge Wallace ' has rendered a decision
at which those held as witnesses in crim

of the witnesses to the affray.at the race
track in which Jasper Madison, a jockey,

was taken in charge by the police, ami
Proctor was included in the arrest as I a
witness. Madison soon* furnished bonds,
but Proctor was not so fortunate, and for
several .weeks, while Madison, the of

witness, has been languishing behind
prison bars. The case has been continued
a number of times, and each. time another
period has been added to the detention of

The jury? like many of :, its predecessors, .
has devoted a good. deal of time to reading
and discussing communications relating
to cases which have been in the courts and
dismissed. ;It seems that the jurors, who
are now serving for the first time, are- in
favor of ;" reading and fully considering
everything presented in the form of com
munications in writing. _ Men who have
had Grand Jury service in the past know
how much time is wasted in the considera

clined to put aside all trivial complaints. "j"
If the present Grand Jury has; now any
fixed definite "purpose -'in", view that

ASSAYING THE ASSAYS
Value of the! Hale? & ? Norcross
Car arid Battery Ore i? "'/:
Sample's. ':'
RICH ROCK THAT WENT ASTRAY
! Attorney Wood for the Defendants Re
j fers to Yolo County Scientific
: ? 'Knowledge?.? /: *
All day yesterday Attorney W. S. Wood
for the defendants" in the Hale & Norcross
mining case labored to make plain the
reason why f the battery-sample assays of
the Overman ore were really J higher than
the car-sample J assays. This was an ex
ception, he * argued? for in -j all other cases
on the Comstock? the car-sample : assays
were the higher,' and so much higher as to
be considered unreliable by assayers. Well
might the 'defendants dwell on this point,
because then they must explain why about
$4,000,000 worth of ore, milled from 1888 to
1892, only turned out about $2,750,000 for
the stockholders. * If thousands of tons of
ore worth from $75 to j $125 per ton could
go astray in the â  little * Hale & Norcross
mine, how many millions of dollars'
worth in the ?reat mines on the Comstock
have probably beenâ but that is another
story. ' â¢
As a matter of fact counsel might be
supposed to be s wrong because 80,000 tons
of Consolidated Virginia*; ore ' throughout
last year-had a running battery sample
assay of $55 10 and a car sample assay.. of
$51 25.7 The ..." Hale & Norcross in 1895
made a like record. ,. â .:â /â 
Mr. Wood referred to Superintendent
Ryan's testimony as additional proof that
ore assays were untrustworthy,? A portion
of Ryan's testimony was to the effect that
while he was working ore last year in the
Brunswick mill he learned that $9 per ton
remained in the battery and . did not show
in the battery sample assays. This "stray"
value was, of course, found at the monthly
"clean-up" and turned" over to the mine.
There is no record that any "stray" stuff
was found and turned over at. the "clean
up" for the Hale & Norcross mine. ..,.* .'--â .?:
f The attorney, held â that the total value
of the ore, less the moisture, by battery
sample; would be. 52,047,300, and. that the
bullion returns of . 84,000 tons were $1,678,
--921 76. The loss in working was $6 50 ' per
ton, and this' shows that the defendants
have returned the full amount of bullion.
He called the attention of the court to
6000 tons of Hale & Norcross ore, worked
in 1892, when the mill eot 68 . per cent ;of
â¢ the battery and 51 ; per cent of the car
assays. : , He did not state, however, that
Foreman Pearce testified that this was re
fuse ore and full of fragments of old tun
nel timbers. â¢ _ >* .
â¢ i Reference was made to reports of the
United States Geological Survey regarding
tbe great. difference between wagon and
battery-sample assays in the Savage mine
in 1 1869, which ; was about :$4 50 per > ton.
Then ; Mr. .;. Wood â¢, referred in ; ridiculing
terms to Justice .Garoutte's emphatic' as
sertion that the return 'of 52 per cent of
the car-sample assay which the defendants
. made .to the mine was not enough, and
"everybody . knows it." 'â¢"â¢<â¢''â¢ -"'-7"- *,â¢â¢
--; "Well, the scientific officials of the Uni
ted States ; Geological . â  Survey ;* didn't
know it," said Attorney. Wood, "but it ap
pears (hat Yolo County Supreme Justices
are well acquainted with those matters."
: This closed Mr. Wood's carefully pre
pared $ written â â¢; argument 7, upon i sample
assays, 1 which took two days in its read
ing, and to-day Attorney Deal will resume
the argument for the defendants. ,-;
Stabbed by an Actor.
I A stabbing affray occurred in the beer ball
at 107 .Grant avenue at an early hour yester
day ' morning, resulting in Frank ' Barden, a
variety actor, being in the City Prison on a
charge of assault with a deadly weapon and
Oscar McMann of Stockton being in the Re
ceiving Hospital with a' knife wound in, his
abdomen. Barden was arrested ' by Policemen
Din an and Douglass. From what the police
men have learned it appears that McMann and
â  a friend * were iin , the , beer hall under the in
fluence of liquor : when Barden entered. Mc-
Mann's friend charged Burden with stealing a
watch from him at' Bakersfield, which Barden
denied. .A fight followed,* and McMann was

What Sportsmen, Athletes and

The -wheelmen will take advantage of
the beautiful weather for an outing in the
country to-morrow, and a ride to Hay

enjoyed by many devotees of cycling. *
Sportsmen will turn their backs on the
marshes and uplands " next Saturday,' it
being the last day of the game-shooting

Jby poachers has caused anglers to wonder

Frank M. Byrne, the Class A Crack,

The roads in the park and country
should be ridable to-morrow, . for . the
northerly winds of the. past few days have
bad a drying effect. There. will probably
be an immense number of riders in tne
XV. U. Tooker, President Imperial Cycling
Club.
park, for wheelmen do not care to take
long journeys at this season of the year,
and riding about the park, stopping here
and there, is more to their liking. r Many
of the contestants in the 25-mile road race,
to be run two weeks from to-day over the
San Leandro triangle, will cross the bay so
as to have the advantage of a day's train
ing over the course they are to ride upon.
The regular monthly meeting of the offi
cers of the North California Division,
League of American Wheelmen, will be
held this evening at the rooms of the Bay
City Wheelmen. The annual league meet
will probably be awarded to Petaluma,
and considerable other business of import
ance will be transacted.
Captain Will I. Pixley has called a run
of the members of the San Francisco Road
Club to Haywards to-morrow. From High
street, Fruitvale, to Haywards the road
racing devotees will have a try-out as a
sort of preliminary training for the
25-mile race, and to judge the men's
qualifications for positions on the club's
relay team.
Gate: money to the amount of $50,000,
representing the admission fees of 120,000
visitors, constitutes the most incontro
vertible and , satisfactory evidence of the
astonishing success of the recent New
York cycle show. The attendance was as
follows: Saturday 10,160, Monday 16,186,
Tuesday 17,896. Wednesday 18.590, Thurs
day 17,023, Friday 16,125, Saturday 20,564.
Popular as was the show held in Chicago
a few weeks previously, : the New York
show surpassed the most sanguine, ex
pectations, and the Cycle Board of Trade
is now considering what to do with the
thousands of dollars which it has taken at
the doors of the two shows. It has been
suggested that the board might see its way
to devoting the amount to the cause of the
Improvement of . roads ' throughout", the
country. No better use cpuld possibly be
found for the money, nor one. more calcu
lated to promote the interests of cycling. j
The League of American Wheelmen in'
this State is looking out for all its mem
bers who have .been: arrested in this City
for violating the new bicycle ordinance.
Of the nine men arrested about a week ago
and who appeared in Judge Low's court,
seven were defended by the league and
their cases were dismissed. . The - other
two paid a fine of s $5 each. . The other day
twenty-one were arrested in the Mission,
and although come were not league mem
bers, the league defended the entire batch
and' Judge Joachimsen dismissed* them
with only a reprimand. - The *â  league is
doing good work for its members -in this
State and deserves the support of : every
wheelman. ;.- >â¢â ' - -.
The six-seated machine now en route to
Santa . Monica 'to be used by: the l record
breakers there : weighs 137 pounds and is
geared to 120. It is built after the fashion
of a truss bridge and can sustain an im
mense weight. The makers believe that
with it six men can ride a mile straight
away in 1:10, or even less. """// '/://-- -/".
â¢ A. Kennedy-Child, a. well-known East
ern wheelman, says the bloomer costume
is being discarded" by most of its earlier ad
vocates there. He says -the popular cos
tume .is a.; short skirt/ hanging i straight,
without draping or ornamentation, leg
gings and shirt waists or blouses'. But,
then, what does a man know about what
is proper, for a lady's cycling costume,
anyway? ' ,/ *>
Chief Consul Kerrigan is making arrange
ments with the management of the indoor
tournament to be held at the pavilion next

Very, little has been said about the Cres
cent' Road Club lately, but it has only been
waiting for, the riding season to open again.

Class B gained immense favor at the
New York Cycle Show, when several man

tions i that f they would support class , B
racing teams in case the L. A. W. delegates
to the National Assembly, to: be held next
week at ' Baltimore,* voted, to sustain the
class. -It is the general sentiment ; that
class B should be encouraged in preference

sions were heard in favor of it -that the
National Assembly delegates will do well
to abide by the general ; opinion. The
riders themselves are for 'class B. They
are not anxious to be put into -profession
alism, for they realize that the public is
not ready to accept that class, and should
the public â *â  look with disfavor upon the
"pro ' riders : racing, would soon be dis
couraged. While V the L. A. W. officials
have not openly expressed their views on
this question, it is the general impression
that class B will be their choice.
E. C. Bald, the champion class B man of
1595, has not stoned, for this -year, pre
ferring to await the action of the delegates
regarding -the various; classes of racing
men. He is quoted as being anxious that
class B be retained for at least another
year. - He once asked the mighty Zimmer
man if it would be wise for, him to become
a professional, and the latter, in a short,
sharp reply, characteristic of the man, ad
vised him, "No; stay where . you are."
Bald has a great-deal of, admiration for
Zimmerman's business acumen and fore
sight and he gladly followed the advice
given. -.".'*.*â¢; -*â â¢-.'

THE' ANGLER.
Shameful Destruction of Breeding
Fishes in the Creeks.
Of the streams which are largely patron
ized by the anglers of this City during the
months of April, and June, the Paper
Mill, Lagunita. and Sonoma creeks head
the list. v -
Anglers will regret to learn, however,
that ' the prospects for good sport during
the coming season on the streams in ques
tion are very poor, indeed, because of the
great slaughter of breeding fishes which
has been, going on uninterruptedly ever
since the rainstorm subsided. If Messrs.
;Emeric and Murdoch, Fish Commission
ers of this State? happened to be taking a
constitutional walk between Camp Taylor
and Tocaloma on last -Wednesday after
noon, they would have . seen at least one
dozen poachers with spears and gaffs on
the riffles murdering the large steelheads
which, at this time of the year when the
."FINISHING HIS RUSH WITH A LEAP IN THE AIR."
_..'.. [Reproduced from Jitcrca'.ion.]
water is comparatively clear and low, fall
easy prey to the spearmen.
It is too bad that such a nefarious sys
tem of fish slaughter is allowed to go on
unheeded by a Fish Commission and al
most undertheir very noses.
There can |be .no j reasonable excuse of
fered in this case by the commission for a
neglect of duty. As previously stated in
The Call, one deputy at least should be
detailed to patrol those | streams that are
within reasonable distance of the anglers
of this City during the months of Febru
ary and March. The Commissioners, when
asked why they do not dispatch officers to
places where the law is being openly vio
lated, answer that their funds are so ex
tremely low that they cannot afford the ex
pense. The Commissioners contend that
the appropriation which they received
from the State has been exhausted in the
maintenance' of fish â '. hatcheries and the
labor ployed in the stocking of far-away
streams with fry. :-' '.
This may be all well and good in its
way, but it remains a fact, nevertheless,
that the anglers of this City, of whom
there are many, would be pleased to see
the Commissioners devoting some atten
tion to the coast streams which are exten
sively whipped? by. the local fraternity
when the trout season opens. :
If the breeding fishes are killed off by
poachers what kind of sport can those who
observe the law expect when they repair
to those well-known waters for a few days'
trouting? Anglers who can afford the
time and expense that are attached to a
trip into the mountains are few in com
parison to the numbers who journey into
the near counties for a few days' outing.
. It is hoped that the Commissioners will
at least | show some desire to stop the pres
ent slaughter of breeding fishes by detail
ing a deputy to patrol the principal ang
ling streams near at home from now until
the opening day of the trout-fishing season.
: It is strange .that of I the many anglers
who fish for large steelheads there are com
paratively few among them who under
stand how *. to r play a fish properly. To
those who have had but a limited experi
ence in playing game fishes the following
instructions may be of value:
i Immediately after striking a fish prepare
for a little desperate play/ "If it rushes off
great distance from you get near it
again*, as ' quickly as | possible 1 j and' ; never
allow a foot more 'line than is ' necessary.
Keep your rod well up and a firm strain on
it at all times. The reel should be always
up and not underneath as sometimes seen
when inexperienced anglers are handling a
rod. Should the fish leap from the .water.
lower the point of the rod quickly, so
as to avoid his striking the line and tight
en v the "...'â  line / instantly he.'/ disap
pears.,- Always keep /your, fish 7 mov
ing. i Never allow . him to lodge if
possible / and fight him: : up stream,'
keeping 'well below ? him. As soon as his
wild rushes are over Â» press him as hard as
you can, according to the strength of your
tackle, and work him toward ..the place
you have selected for a landing. He will
generally make a rush when he rinds him-,
self in shallow water, in which case let him
go a safe distance, but be careful that he
does not snag you, should there be any
sunken roots or tree stumps near at hand.*
'â â :â  A steelhead 7 will: invariably/ head :, for
such places in his last dash lor freedom.
If a fish sulks it is a good plan to get be
low him, if possible,: then drop the point
of your rod so that the weight of the stream
will place the g greatest k vibration \on the
line, and this i. will ,j generally*' get ; him to
move; if not, hit the butt of the rod a few
times and you will hear the reel sing.**. ?
Should a fish dash? down = stream where
you cannot follow, and is likely to take all
the line on your ;* reel J and * leave ; j you to
soliloquize over a bad; job, hold the rod
with your right hand; while with the: left
throw off some five yards of line from: the
reel. At the same , time. your rod should
be well up, and when you'have your slack
ready,*", throw *; your rod Â£ forward as if
switching. /This* scheme has **" frequently
proved successful and saved many yards
of line and a good fish. The fish either
turns on feeling the slack line before him,
or more probably on being freed from I the
pressure of the line fancies he ; is * free, and
turns his head up stream again.
'. In gaffing a fish there are many ways, but
the surest and best method %is to "watch
quietly, a favorable opportunity, with .. the
gaff extended in the water, the point facing
. upward, and '"*. when the fish is brought
fairly over ' the instrument, f strike it I"and
hold | the right ' arm well'? up ": so i that * the
fish will not slip off. Several splendid fish
have been lost by *? inexperienced â ? handlers
of. the gaff. '- :;;>,:,: ;
{<â  Several * large steelheads â  were " caught
near Point Reyes during ' the past week,
and as local anglers have been anxiously
waiting an opportunity to enjoy the sport
of handling a game ten or twelve pounder,
the rush to the happy fishing grounds to
morrow will be something unprecedented
in the history of steelheaJ fishing on this
coast. l-y, r ;â : v r *v- -. â¢: - ..-'.-.. -yy/.y?- ":*.?
Bets have been made that over 100 rods
will be pointing out from the banks of the

B John Jones, the handball champion of
Australia, was a passenger on the steamer
Mariposa, which sailed for the antipodes
yesterday .afternoon. Jones during his
comparatively. brief 'residence in this City
did more to promote the interests of hand
hall than all the other players put to
gether. He always . "â  drew .' a crowd of
enthusiastic admirers wherever and when
ever he played, and his handling of the
ball/was a revelation to them. He never
was called upon here to show to the full
est extent what" he was r capable of doing,
and his greatest regret was' that on injury
received while at Stockton prevented birn
from doing so before taking his departure.
Amateur Champion P. T. Donnelly always
believed that Jones could defeat any trio
of players on the coast." 7 '
*' * Before leaving Jones expressed his
warmest thanks to his numerous friends
and "to- the; press, particularly The Call,
for the manner in which he had been sup
ported while here and his hope that he
would soon return again, as he would
like to make his permanent home here.
His abmition is to meet Fitzgerald, -the
world's champion, either here or in

NO LEGAL AUTHORITY FOUND.
The Finance Committee of the Super
visors Hay Have a Legal Battle
on Its Hands. "â¢ â  â  '
r- There is every, prospect of . a lively legal
battle between the Finance Committee of
the Board of Supervisors and Auditor
Broderick or. one side and the Board of
Health' on the other over the salaries of the
milk inspectors . which the latter body has
given notice that it will shortly appoint.
The matter came to the ears of the
Finance Committee in an? informal way
and the , subject was brought , up at yes
terday's meeting. ] Supervisor Taylor said
thai -he ; understood that the ~ Board of
Health would shortly appoint three or
more mill, inspectors to be stationed at the
ferries and on the roads leading into, San
Francisco . for ' the purpose of examining
milk and meat intended for the markets
and restaurants as well as private families
of this City. He wanted to know by what
authority the " board '\ would make its ap
pointments and how the proposed em
ployes were to be paid. '.:*-*'
"As far as I know," said Mr. Taylor,
"no provision has been made in the tax
levy for the payment of salaries and as the
law requires that only those shall be Paid
who have been provided for in this manner
or by order of court, I do not see how we
can allow such a thing to goon. As a
matter of fact I don't believe that the
salary of the present?- insDector, Mr.
Dockery, figured in the levy. 1 move that
Auditor BrodericK be called in to enlighten
the committee on this question." .
A messenger was, dispatched for the
Auditor and he was requested to explain
why the salary had been allowed. Mr.
Broderick explained .that., he had signed
Mr. Dockery's warrant under the law that
permits the Board of Health to employ
such additional help as may be absolutely
necessary for the proper conduct of the
department. He was not at all sure that
any further inspectors were necessary. -.'..â 
After some discussion as to the needs of
the Board of Health in the matter of in
spectors it was decided that any.new ones
who might be appointed cannot receive
salary out of the City Treasury until after
the beginning of *'; the next fiscal year,
unless the Board of Health wishes to pro-'
vide the funds itself. *'
Auditor Broderick was instructed that if
warrants are } presented for additional
milk inspectors or inspectors of j any kind
the same must be refused. In* case the
Board of . Health decides to take the mat-*
ter into the courts .and mandamus the
Auditor, ascitis expected it will, the Fi
nance Committee will furnish Mr. Brod
erick with an . attorney to fight' the case
and pay all the necessary expenses.
Dr. Hart of the Board :r of Health said
last evening that he - had* heard- of the
action of the Finance Commitee.
"It i will not make. any difference with
us," he said, "for when the proper time
arrives we shall co ahead and appoint the
men we need. "We believe it to" be a mat
ter of urgent necessityâ one that should
be attended to at once if the public health,
of which we are presumed to be the
guardians, is to be considered. I cannot
say whether we will take the* matter into
the courts or not, but I * suppose that will
be the only course if the Auditor persists
in refusing to sign the warrants."
The Lecture to Teachers.
The third lecture in the special course to the
San Francisco schoolteachers was given by
Professor Thomas P. Bailey Jr. of the Univer
sity of California, in the auditorium of the
Girls' High School, corner of Scott and Geary
streets, last evening at 8 o'clock. ' The subject
was "Education of the Human Animal."
Music was furnished by the eighth and ninth
grade classes of the Mission Grammar School.
The fourth lecture will be delivered in the
auditorium of the Girls' High School on Friday
evening,. February 21, at 8 o'clock, by Hon.
Horace Davis. His subject will be â¢â¢-The Story

Nobby Clarke's Affairs.
: The investigation into the affairs of Alfred
Clarke consumed a good part of yesterday after
noon before Judge Slack, but there was very
little progress made toward ascertaining poet
what Clarke has done with his property. His
type-writer and J. F. Turner gave some testi
mony as to certain notes, and Jacob Bertz, the
assignee of his creditors, was on the stand, but
nothing definite was learned of the two $15,

Sciatic Rheumatism and Its Cure.
' 7- :\'v- From the Gazette, Burlington, lowa.
* The story of Mr. Tabor's nearly fatal attack
of sciatic rheumatism is familiar .to his. large
circle of acquaintances, but for the benefit of
others and those similarly afflicted the Gazette
has investigated the matter for publication
Mr. Tabor is secretary and treasurer of the
Commercial Printing Company, with offices in
the Hedge Block, and resides at 417 Basset
street, Burlington, lowa. A Gazette man sought
an Interview â¢ with Mr. Tabor at his place of
business to-day, and, although he was binilv
engaged 'with imperative duties, he talked
freely and feelingly on the subject of his recent
sickness and subsequent wonderful cure
-'Yes," said Mr. Tabor, "i can safely say that
I am a well. man. that is, my old ; trouble with
rheumatism has entirely disappeared, but I am
still taking Pink Pills and wilTkeep on taking
them as ,lpng>-as r. continue to grow

every, day since I began ; to use .them. You
will not wonder at my profound faith in the

and all the tortures which * that " horrible dis
ease is capable of inflicting. At length, under
the constant care of a local physician, I was
enabled to return to my work, but only at in
tervals. Severe attacks .would appear regu
larly in my back and descend into mv leg and
foot, and threatened to make me a permanent
cripple. 1 I tried various remedies for rheuma
tism, but "without any : beneficial results. I
grew pale, weak and haggard, and my family
and friends grew alarmed at my condition
â¢,7t^ Ut eight week 3 ago m mother induced
me to try Dr. -Williams' Pink Pills for Pale
People and you know the result. Before I had
used one box I felt greatly relieved and much
stronger. I continued their use and improved
rapidly. I have now . taken i eight boxes and
feel like a new man and completely cured, all
of winch is due to the efficacy, of Pink Pills
They are invigorating and thoroughly whole
some, and have helped me in every way." , >
In '"' reply to ' inquiries Mr. Henry, the drug
gist, stated that; Dr. Williams' Pink Pills were
having " a \ large | sale, '/hat j ; it was particularly
gratifying to him to know that the customers
themselves were highly pleased with the bene
fits they nad derived from their use ; that many
of them stated that the piils were the only me

not only gave quick relief butpermanent

Dramatic Life of Pom K. Soh,
the -Korean Minister to
Washington.
HE ONCE TIED FROM PURSUERS.
Minister Soh's Story of the -Steady
Progress of Koreaâ The Death '
of the Queen.
Pom K. Soh, the newly appointed
Korean Minister to the United States, ar
rived here yesterday on the Gaelic from
Seoul on his way to Washington, and is
at the Occidental. He is accompanied by
his secretary, B. S. Pak.
It is strange what changes the whirligig
of time brings about. A few years, ago
Mr. Soh was a friendless exile 'from the
land of his birth. He is of noble blood,
and another Kosciusco or Garibaldi so fur
as freedom and progress are concerned.
At least so it appeared in the drama of
which he formed a part.
Since then he was recalled by the King,
became a Minister of Justice, and now is
going to represent his country as Minister

in the very capital where he was driven as
1 0i exile, and where for a time he was
/given a position under the United States
VSovernment. ? " " - r "â '
It is said to have been largely on account
of the machinations of the Queen of Korea,
who was another Cleopatra for intrigue.
The Queen was Hilled recently, but in the
drama or tragedy to Which it had turned
no one can be found who is known to have
committed the deed. .; 7?" - â¢
In 1883 Mr. , Soh came to the United
States as secretary of the legation. There
was an overturning after a few months,
and he was called home. While at home
he interested himself in furthering various
reforms. . For this, in company with era,
his life was sought, and they fled, intend
ing to reach the United States.
One of the reform rs was killed in Japan
and the others managed to reach here.
Mr. Soh, by the aid of friends in San
Francisco and elsewhere in the United
States, was appointed to a place in the
Smithsonian Institution and afterward to
other departments. 7.
He spent ten years here, became a Chris
tian, learned the language, and advanced
himself as best he could. Something near
a year ago he was called back by the
Korean King, Soh's party having mean
while grown very strong.
On the same steamer departed Ye Sin
Soo, the Korean Minister, representing
the faction that had driven him out. He
was unwell and was going home on a leave
;of absence. He was dressed in the tour
ing - hat and strange '; costume of the
Koreans, while Soh was clad in American
attire. "He is no better than a Chinaman,"
said Mr. Soh. sarcastically. ' Minister Soo
died in Korea, and Mr. Soh. after serving
meanwhile as Minister of Justice, is re
turning as Minister Soo'a successor. He
is attired in the American dress and per
haps the Korean costume may never again
be seen at the National capital.
Minister Soh says that by an edict issued
on January 1 the American -dress is being
adopted, and the hair is being cut short as
in rriost of the civilized countries. . i
"The people all have to abide: by. the
order," ' said the Minister. .''Of: course
there were a great -many who, because of
the customs to which they. had long been
used, /disliked to cut their ", hair and
wear a different kind of clothing. That
was to be expected. ; Still they began at
once to adapt themselves to the new order
of things. â¢
"Seoul, you ': know, has 500,000 people,
and Korea as a whole has certainly not less
than 15,000,000 of a population, and, as I
believe, has probably "20.000,000. With so
many people it was difficult to carry out
the order. The small villages were more
obdurate than the large cities.
"The country is advancing steadily,
though not as rapidly as I could wish.
Since the revolution there are indications I
of greater progress. /..
""The Queen, of. whose death we know,
through the attendants, was a woman of
signal aoility. Her powers were unusual,
and she was really a great woman, but, she
was not ?of* royal blood. She was, how
ever,' of a' good family. .John A. Cockerill,
the correspondent. who recently visited
Korea, did me an injustice recently in
implying that I was in a measure respon
sible for the tragedy. 7<l Â» met > him in' the
Grand Hotel afterward and he admitted
he had cons me a wrong," and was very
pleasant in connection with some inquiries
about Korea. l r 7* ; " ' 7 "7" 7 7 7â¢: --â¢ â 'â¢:

In response to . 2000 invitations about
forty gentlemen assembled in the Cham
ber of Commerce yesterday afternoon to
discuss the growing importance' of the
Japanese industrial 'question.'- ..'.
Among; those present were members of
the; Chamber of Commerce, Board of
Trade, Manufacturers and Producers' As
sociation : and", other commercial and in
dustrial organizations, besides, a number
of men prominent in the walks of -. science
and trade. .â '.'â '-'''â '
In the absence of President Craig at
Monterey, M. J. Keller of ; Oakland called
the meeting to order, and stated, in a few
words? the. object for which it was con
vened. - . â-. . .
; ''This question of the Invasion of Japan
ese manufactured goods into the field of
American commerce," he said,"has, like the
Chinese question, two sides. The Chinese
question was, as we all know,* settled by
the people of the Nation to the effect that
'the Chinese must go.' S So also the solu
tion of the Japanese manufacturing prob
lem must be fcettled by the people. am
not here to take sides in the matter,
is subjected to the Chamber of Commerce
for the" careful consideration Which Â« it
merits." ' '>â¢.â¢'.;â¢... .-.; .>,.>.-'.*;. >.'A.*.:*4
William Merry, who; in* conjunction
With Frederick H. Dingle, acted as secre
tary, then read the following report pre

nated by the Chamber of ' Commerce and
the Manufacturers and Producers' Asso
ciation to investigate the point at issue:.,
,^To the Board of (Directors of the Manufactur

Your : commtttee appointed to confer with , a
committee from the Chamber of Commerce on
the. subject of the Japanese invasion of our
manufacturing field beg leave to report as fol

- The committee appointed by the Chamber of
Commerce consisted of Messrs. Hugh Craig,
Wakefield Baker and George H. Collins, which
gentlemen, with Messrs. Julian Sonntag, A.
Sbarboro and J. P. Currier from this associa
tion, composed the joint committee of confer
ence.* This joint committee 'held meetings on
December 23, 1895, January 6, 16 and 23,
1896. Copies of the minutes of said meetings
are hereto attached. ,"â¢* .
..' The joint committee called to their â  assist
ance in the investigation - of the subject in
hand Messrs. W. B. Curtis of the Traffic Asso
ciation, State Labor Commissioner E.L. Fitz
gerald, W. F. Bowers, Professor i George David
son and William , Rutherford. At the first
meeting several sub-committees were- ap
pointed to investigate the different lines of
manufactures, and after a thorough investiga
tion by said committees â  reports - have been
made showing that the invasion of the manu
facturing field of the United States by Japan
ese cheap labor manufactures threatens to be
come a most formidable one. Your committee
most respectfully call the attention of the
board to the report of William Rutherford,
which goes very much into detail on the sub
ject under consideration. Your committee
further beg to call the attention of tbis board
of directors to the resolutions â¢ passed at . the
last meeting of. this committee, as follows:
Resolved, Tnat this committee report to their
respective bodies, including in such report the
reports.made by the sub-committees, and also
that of Mr. Rutherford, and urge upon the
Manufacturers and Producers' Association and
the Chamber of Commerce to request the Cali
fornia delegation in the Senate and House of
Representatives, of the United " States to
recommend the appointment of a committee
of three to investigate the question ol Japanese
manufactures, importations and export trade:
and furthermore be it '.'.â .
Rctoh'cd, That this committee recommend to
the Chamber of Commerce and to the Manu
facturers and Producers' Association that a
mass-meeting be held in the Chamber of Com
merce at the very earliest date possible, in
order to set before the people the position that
we now occupy toward .Japan. . â 
And having presented these resolutions, your
committee hope that this board. of directors
will take the matter up immediately and follow
out the suggestions/ contained "in Bald
resolutions. Respectfully submitted,
Julian Sonntag, Chairman.
A. Sbaeboro, Secretary."
The reports of the various sub-commit
tees dealt fully with the several branches
of industry said to be most in danger by
reason of Japanese cheap labor, and Mr.
Rutherford's special report, which has
already been published in a forme* issue
of The Call, gave a masterly resume of
the entire question." The reading of the
reports was listened to with every mark of
interest by all present. â¢"* . ...... .;,*...-
Julian Sonntag, chairman of. the joint
committee, was then called upon for some
remarks \ on the r subject. He exhibited a
copy of the Japanese-American Commer
cial Pioneer, published in New York, and
having, he said, a circulation in Japan
alone of over 50,000. â ,â¢â ".
"It has been said," he remarked, "that
Japan can"* never, compete successfully
with England Sor America , in the field of
commerce and; manufacture. v This idea
is a dangerous fallacy. .To-day you can
go into any dry-goods store, and unless"
you are thoroughly conversant with tex
tile fabrics you. cannot tell French and
Japanese silks apart. Â" Japan once - im
ported large numbers, of i ; clocks and
watches. Now there are thirteen large
watch factories in ,; Japan. â¢ : Millions * and
millions of gross of Japanese" matches,
equal to the best iucifers, are finding their
way into China, the entire Orient, Europe
and America." .*. " â -â ' 'â¢â .,,
'Mr. Sonntag then read a number of ex
tracts â  from , consular reports 7 and from
English, American and German* papers,
from which it appeared, that the Japanese
ara making great advances in every variety
of skilled labor.:. One extract mentioned
the immense increase in the exportation
of carpets from Japan, notably from Osaka,
which rival those of Egypt, Turkey and
Persia. These carpets, it f was said, "' had
found their way into every market, being
exported to America in particular by large
shipments. â  - Mr. , Sonntag concluded >by
earnestly recommending, that the state of
things be brought to the attention of Con
gress, in order that: some ! remedy be de
vised : for a the protection of 'i American in
dustry and? trade from' danger of extinc
tion â¢ by reason : of unrestricted Japanese
competition.
.; Charles J. King, ; the nÂ»xt speaker,; re
marked that in the past it had seemed a3
though the j authorities at Washington
were j singularly apathetic regarding mat
ters particularly affecting "California?
Now, however, he thought the good of the
western coastâ garden of ' the Union
was beginning to receive some considera
tion at the.hands of the far-away Federal
authorities. He earnestly commended the
project of sending a memorial to Congress
in which the protection of the Government
be invoked in favor of Pacific Coast indus
try and trade/., '-'â â 'â  â¢'--* 'â ':â ' '.â¢" t.- â¢â¢ --.'"â ;. -â .â ..., .-;.-.
"â¢^Walter Hirschfeld took another view of
the matter. He said Americans were as a
people averse to menial work and that the
real problem : was not 7 how; to protect
American industries, but how to build up
among Americans 7a; spirit Jof ' industry.
The Japanese ; were f bound to go ahead be
cause they were workers, and until^the
American peoples learn to go to work like
the people of other nations ne opined that
foreign*; manufactures would "; always have
a market in the United States.
'?$ M. M. Barnett >> disagreed v with Mr.
Hirshfelri. That speaker had | referred to
the small attendance at the meeting," but
Mr. Barnett contended that the absence of
some rof ? tbe business a men-' of â¢'" the - City
proved little.' 7 He said the-? factories: and
workshops of the country were slowly fill
: ing up with Japanese, who were I learning
the ins arid outs of American "3 industry so
as to dominate it in time.7:?777 - 7: \7.

and long-suffering man, but' after being

up for himself and fight his battle like a
man; -..; :"'.":. ;.".'. â¢'"?'"' â ...-',.'-'. â  ~7'' v ?-7 '-> :;.'..'â¢.
"The only remedy is," he continued,
"for American citizens to ' protect _ Ameri
can industries. When I say 'American' I
mean 'American', in the widest sense. The
spirit of the Boston tea party, is ' nit J dead
in American hearts.' The time ; will come
when -' the ; people X will refuse ;to ; permit
'American: manufactures to \ be r . reduced to
any foreign standard. If foreign*importa
tions threaten to undermine our commerce
then let them be stopped." * a-y^y-,;-'.*'
: : L." G. ": Schroder ; dwelt at length on the
necessity for \ individual I action. g Consum
ers should abstain from buying articles of
Japanese manufacture j? and , - then the*
"Japanese invasion" would lose its terror.
He mentioned : the failure of ': the Otay
Company at San ; Diego and said
the ; machinery had been 'taken to Japan,
where the purchaser was conducting a
"magnificent business, the watches turned
out by Japanese workmen finding a ready
market in all parts of : the world. ..*:
â i Craigie Sharp said the only way to pro
tect Californian industry was to put up
factories on the coaet and keep them go
ing. If foreign manufactures offered ; a
menace to the success of domestic indus
tries then the tariff should be' raised so as
to keep them out. ', y\ ;â¢ " ,
"Now is the time," continued Mr. Sharp,
"for us to show, Japan and the world : that
we can take care of ourselves in the face of
everything. We must get â¢to work and
keep the work going. Our brethren in the
East are not going to sit calmly by and
permit California to be made a mere geo
graphical expression, and Californian boys
and girls kept from all chance of learning
how to make an honest living. -; ; ,
"The old spirit of '49 is away behind the
times. The old-fashioned folks seem:, to
wish -to fasten on to all the money in.
sight and sink it ; deep in their .' pockets.
What we want is public spirit, plenty of
it. If this spirit * can be once ; diffused
among the people we need fear nothing
from Japan or from any other quarter
whatever. Let the American people. get
to work and work together, and nothing
on earth can down them."
;t Other, well-known business men ad
dressed the meeting in a similar strain,
after which the following resolutions were.
unanimously adopted and ordered sent. to
every member of Congress:
: Whereas, The matter of the Invasion of the
manufacturing field of . the United States by
goods manufactured by cheap labor in Japan
has been under consideration by the Manufac
turers and Producers' Association of Califor
nia and by the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce; and whereas, a joint committee from
the Manufacturers and Producers' Association
and the Chamber of : Commerce of San Fran
cisco, after . full investigation aud considera
tion, have reported that great danger to the
manufacturing interests of the United States
exists in the rapid strides being made by Japan
in manufacturing; and whereas, this meeting
of the members of . the Manufacturers* and
Producers' Association and of the Chamber of
Commerce, called for the purpose of discussing
the subject, have listened to the report of the
said joint committee and the remarks made
thereon ; be it "â¢*â¢ < .. .â â ;-.* >. .
. Resolved, By the Manufacturers ' and I Pro

Congress of the United States be requested and
urged to appoint a commission to "investigate
the question of Japanese manufactured im
portations and Japanese export trade.
NEVER SPOKE ON FUNDING
William B. Curtis Repudiates a
'â "-.. Huntington Alleged 77
Interview.
The Manager of the Traffic Association
Exposes a Southern Pacific
Trick.
, The anti-funding bill bureau of C. P.
Huntington's in Washington made a
barefaced plea in its unpopular cause, little
thinking that, -like' the boomerang, y the
play for sympathy would come back upon
it with overwhelming force. Through a
Washington paper it caused ;' to - be Â«; pub
lished a series of interviews with men
prominent in various walks of -life in San
Francisco, all expressing unbounded ap
proval in the funding bill. .77 7 '
Among the number of those represented
as having been interviewed : was Traffic
Manager Curtis of: the Traffic Association
of California, the avowed enemy 'of -high
freight rates, and consequently, the foe of
the Southern Pacific of Kentucky.
"There was no man more* thoroughly
surprised than myself on learning that an
interview with me had been published in
the .Washington. Post,"; said Mr. Curtis
yesterday. .*â *"â _ ... have refrained from ex
pressing an opinion on the - funding - bill,
and I- certainly never gave' an interview
upon it either to this Washington paper or
to any other journal." â ..;â ;. . -

San Francisco, Feb. 7, 1896. J
y Editor | San Francisco Callâ â¢ Sir: In
yesterday's Examiner was a. short comment by
Mr. Ambrose Bierce on what purported to be an
interview between myself and the Washington
Post relating to the funding bill. Peimit me
to state- that I have never granted an interview
on that subject nor expressed an opinion on
the same to any one. ..-â â _â .-
I am exceedingly averse to anybody's coin
ing an opinion forme. I have in your valuable
paper gone so far as to assert that should the
Government foreclose on this property and
same should be put up to a resale to the high
est bidder that it would be a feather in San
Francisco's cap to step in and acquire the
property," in that its identity might be main
tained as a line operating purely between
California and- Utah, for under these-circum
stances the life :of the road will depend on its
so operating as to do it the business of Utah
to De done: by California merchants. **
I have never gone further than this, nor was
any one authorized to quote- an opinion ;at
variance with the same., Yours truly, .
Wm. Bostwick Curtis.

â¢ 7 Asceptolin?- a compound which -is the
creation of Dr. Cyrus Edson of New York,
and from which great results are expected
in the way of killing the germ 3of con
sumption, is not exactly a new remedy,
according .* to Dr. Joseph O.Hirschfelder,
who has waged war somewhat in the past
few years against the dread tuberculosis?'
? â¢'The ingredients in asceptolin," said the
physioiah,7"have already been used in the
treatment of consumption. Phenol- is
simply another name for carbolic acid,
and.pilocarpin ' was in = use one year ago by
Dr. Waldstein of New York.; ".
/"I do not say this to detract in the
slightest degree, any of the credit due Dr.
Edson? and I shall be perfectly . delighted
if further observation ' should - prove j the
doctor to be correct in his expectations. i /
"The method I am employing in the en
deavor to suppress tuberculosis is entirely
different from that of Dr. Edson, and is an
imitation of the healine process that
occurs in the * many cases of consumption
that have been known to recover. 7.
"The results thus far , obtained in my

as far as the s ultimate curing of consump
tion is concerned, is that; some remedy
will be \. found. Stronger .- even than that,
he believes that the lymph with which he
is experimenting upon V. the patients tn the
County Hospital will I sooner or later mas

Paine's celery compound is the most re-
markable remedy for the blood and nerves
known to the 19th century. It is employed
by the foremost physicians in curing kid-
ney and liver troubles and the diseases due
to nervous disorders, faulty nutrition, and
impoverished blood, producing results that
seem little short of the miraculous.
Paine's celery compound builds up the
system, purifies; the blood, regulates, the
nerves. The weak and worn out soon find
their frames - invigorated,* their spirits
raised, and their strength renewed.
It makes people well.
It is as superior to the ordinary nervines,
bitters arid sarsaparillas as strength is bet-
ter than weakness. : 77 - â¢ '-Y^;

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V.', Feb. Lower cables from i
London led to selling of stocks in the locai market
during the early trading, and a general though
moderate decline in prices followed. There was
no special pressure, to sell, and realizings easily
account for the slight shading in prices. As the
day advanced, however, the market broadened,
and in the afternoon trading there was an approach
to buoyancy. The Improvement in the market I
was the result of increased buying by commission j
houses, a belief that the Morgan syndicate will be !
.awarded a large proportion of the new bonds, j
which the street interprets as meaning a compaia
tlvely easy working of tbe money market, at least
until the settlements for the new loan are com
pleted.- ';- ; t~ -1
The rise in call loans to 7 per cent to-day had no
significance and was due to bidding by belated bor
rowers. The greatest activity was in the industri
als. Sugar having risen nearly 3 per cent to 113%
on buying by brokers said to be identified with the j
refining interests. Leather preferred jumped
nearly 2 per cent to 67% on stories â¢ that the divi
dend would be declared shortly. Distilling and
Cattle-feeding moved up to 1-8% on an increased
business. Chicago Gas was quiet at 65%Â®65yg,
the opinion of the Attorney -General adverse to the
consolidation of the companies having had no ef
fect- In the late trading Tobacco suddenly
dropped from 79% to 76% and this started selling
all along the line. The prominent issues receded
%to 1% per cent in sympathy. In the final trad
ing the market was steadier in tone.
Net changes show gains of V_ol**S4 per cent ex
cept for Missouri Pacific, Manhattan' and Tobacco,
which lost %Â®2 per cent. Total. sales were 316.
--000 shares.
. Bonds were active and strong. The sales footed
up the large total of Â»2, 31)3,000. Burlington,

CHICAGO. 111., Feb. 7âThere was not much
of interest or importance in the wheat market to
day." It was lower early, but at reduced prices,
comparative steadiness with a -light trade was
noted. Charges that Liverpool "quotations were
manipulated have been in circulation for several
days, the result of which is to deter operators. - To
day the opening advices from Liverpool gave a
, decline of Id and this market opened fi/fec lower on
. the report. - Receipts in the Northwest were 684

mounts above all doubts and fears to a solid cer
tainty that the people can and will uphold their |
Government. The influence of tins event upon all '
I manufacturing and all trade cannot be lightly es-
I timated. It strips the silver situation of. all its
I power to hurt. Ii puts the treasury upon a safe
! basis for the time, whether Congress does anything
or not. It notifies foreign nations that the United
States has power as \ well 'as purpose. It unlocks
millions of gold which have been gathered, in
preparation, brings directly, several millions of
gold from Europe, and .stimulates tbe anxiety of
foreign investors to obtain American securities. â¢â â¢-.
With such a revolution in business suddenly
-1 effected, the customary records. of the past week i
; and month are of less value than usual. But there !
I have been signs of improvement in the iron manu- ,
I facture. Although the average of .prices is nearly '
1 per cent lower this week, and orders for wire
nails are stimulated by a decision to advance the
I price again March 1, there is also a more active
j demand for plates and sheets. Southern . competi
tion lowers coke iron at Chicago and prevents ad
vance at the East, while sales of last year's specu
lators in ' the Pittsburg region still depress
l'.ss-mer. The ere pool Is expected to fix the 1
price lor the year at $4 or possibly $4 50, and the
coke pool still reduces the output. .
Speculation has raised copper to lOl^c, with
sales of 6,000.000 pounds, and tin to 131/3 C. and
lead to 3.10 c, with large exports of Mexican. The :
boot and shoe manufacture does not gain as yet,
leather being about 1 cent lower for the week.
Hides are depressed by tight money, though in j
light demand and about 4 per cent lower for the '
week. Sales of wool have been 4,500.000 pounds
against 5.192.000 pounds last year, and with re- ;
ported reduction in clay worsteds and mixtures
j the orders for other woollen goods are still un-
I usually delayed. .-, â¢
The cotton-mills continue * generally active, i
Though talk of decreasing, the production still ;
continues, pri t cloths do not rise above 2%c, and
some goods tend lower. Speculation In wheat has
again lifted prices. : The speculative market has :
been largely influenced by rumors of injury to tbe
coming crop and by foreign advances. Corn has i
been comparatively quiet. Cotton .is practically ;
unchanged, receipts cintinuing to accord with a '<
yield of . about 7,000,000 bales for 1*95. The !
stock market bas been growing stronger all the
ween until the sale of . bonds, though yielding a
little on realizing. Railroad earnings in January
have been 10.6 larger than last year, but 8.3 lea
than in 1893. and -the tonnage eastbound from
Chicago was in January nearly 1 per cent larger
than In 1893. _______

PRODUCE EXPORTS.
Produce exports from San Francisco jby sea in
, January were $3,896,400, against $1,763,000 in
'â  January, 1895. ' This is a sharp gain for this year.
Great Britain took $1,581,400 last month, against
$651,600 In 1895: Australia $525,200, against
$52,400. and | Souta Africa $84,000 against noth
ing. Thus it will be seen that our increased ex
ports this year are almost wholly due to the pro
nounced revival in the wheat trade. ;â

were 2112 flasks, against 2028 in January, 1895. ;

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS.
WHEATâ It Is reported that New Zealand has a
surplus of from 3,t'00.000 to 4,000,000 bushels, or
from 100.000 to 120,000 short tons, all of which will
be shipped to Australia to make good the defici
ency in that country. This will practically cut off
exports from California unless our holders are will
ing to let go considerably undercurrent quotations,
which is hardly, likely, considering, the fact tbat
the regular demand for Europe is in itself sufficient
to consume the greater part, if not all of our

COALâ A circular for Australia says: "Recent

porarily with Australian, and the outlook is favor
able for liberal shipments this year; In fact Import
ers are already soliciting ' orders for large contracts
for late delivery at a marked, reduction from ask-,
lug prices of 30 days ago. â¢ It is generally believed .
that there will be such an accumulation of tonnage.
in colonial waters a few months hence that freight
ratea will decline, hence our large consumers are
not availing themselves of what appears to be very
low cost fuel. . If the present import cost of Snail
sea Anthracite should -be maintained, it will force
a large number of consumers back to' Australian
who changed off on account of cheap Anthracite:
this will largely, augment increased shipments of
colonic 1. 'there Is a'ready listed about 80.000 tons
of Coal tonnage from Sydney and Newcastle; some
of these vessels will not load for 60 days. There
are about 30,000 toes' due to arrive here within 60
days, so that, there will be no scarcity of Austra

Armenian Question 600 Years Ago.
Not even the Armenian question is new.
Apparently Edward/ 111. had to deal with
it, though in the greatly modified form of
three monks. gln the year . 1360 these
refugees cauie to the King at Reading,
and made compiaint that the Mussulmans
were trying â¢to â â¢ exterminate their people.
Hence they fled, and 7 now -asked leave
to live in England and collect subscrip
tions for their fellow-sufferers. The King
granted this petition and tooK the Arme
nians under his* protection, but only as
long as the protected should do nothing
injurious to . the King and realm and
should "bear themselves in true faith and
honesty." The incident is very curious.
Prom that time to thisâ 63s yearsâ the
persecution of the Armenians has seldom
ceased. . Yet * the Armenians have sur
vived and have kept their faith. Surely
there must be a good deal in a people with
such a history as this.â London Spectator.

CARNOT MEDAL
FOR BERKELEY.
Interest at the Intercol
legiate Forensic
Contest.
STILES HALL THRONGED.
M...C. Flaherty, a '96 Man,
Captures the Prize With'
Hands Down.
DISCUSSING FEENCH POLITICS.
Six Young Men Who Tried to Settle
the Question of the Permanency '
â¢ of the Republic.
. Stiles Hail at Berkeley had no chair
within it that was vacant last night when,
nt 8 o'clock, the annual forensic struggle
between Stanford and Berkeley began.
At the right and left of the big stage the
representatives of the two universities
were seated at tables, and between and
separating them as a moderator sat Presi
dent Kellogg of the State University. .
The question at issue between them was
this: "Has the centralized form of the
French Government been favorable to the
stability of the Republic"?
The Carnot medal, presented by the
Baron de Conbertin for the purpose of
encouraging the study and discussion in
California of French history and politics,
is awarded annually to the student who,
in the opinion of the committee, approves
himself the best debater, the criteria being
scholarship (including information and
diction), argumentative skill, delivery and
spontaneity.
It was for this they were contesting.
The debaters are chosen and assigned, but
twenty-four hours before the contest takes
place.
The negative and affirmative of the ques
tion was not a university affair, for both
universities were represented on both sides.
Those 'â¢hosen for the contest tnis year
were: For the affirmativeâ H. D. Sheldon,
Stanford; P. 8. Howard, Stanford ;M. C.
Flaherty, University, of California. For
the negativeâ C. E. Fryer, Berkeley; E. I.
Miller, Stanford; Theo de L. de Laguna,
Berkeley.
The judges or committees of award were
James D. Phelan and M. Frank Michael of
San Francisco, and Colonel Charles R.
Greenleaf of Berkeley. The committee of
arrangements were Professor Lathrop and
Professor Ross of Stanford, and Professors
Bacon and Gay ley of Berkeley.
The committee of award sat close up
under the stage.
Every seat hud been tasen, indeed, long
before 8 o'clock, and it was with some
nood-natured signs of impatience that the
//udience, largely composed -of ladies, 1
waited the beginning of the battle. Should I
tiny professor or other prominent figure of
either university thread his way down the
aisle it was to the clamor of hand-clapping
and the beating of heels upon the floor.
As the debaters took their seats upon
the stage they were greeted with the yells
of the respective colleges, and so when
they rose to speak their fellows on the floor,
â¢greeted them.
President Kellogg read the rules of the
debate and introduced H. D. Sheldon of
Stanford to open for the affirmative. He
entered upon his subject with the evident
purpose of making the best of his time
limited to fifteen minutes. He outlined
the debate for his side, that it would be
shown that the centralized government
enabled the French to protect themselves
against their enemies abroad, to preserve
order at home; that it lent itself to the
characteristics of the people, adapted to
the essential vigorous foreign policy.
Thee would be illustrated in the course of
the legislation of the past twenty years.
He touched upon all these points ,in : a
rapid, easy discourse of less than ten min
utes. He dwelt upon the necessity of
quick action by the Government to meet
the temperament of the people. .-France
had more anarcnists than any other Gov
ernment in Europe. To meet a sudden
outbreak the head of the Government must
have a ready command of the army and
the other arms of tbe Government. . France
had for neighbors the powers of Europe,
in no wise disposed toward friendship or
peace. She must be quick to meet any
hostile move. He instanced the quick
suppression of Boulanger through tbe
power of the head of the Government. 7 "
O. E. Fryer of Berkeley took up the
cause for the negativeâ that centralization
presented a danger to stability. He cited
as instances the temptation of the one
man in power to usurp to himself Im
perial power as Napoleon had done. In a
Government honeycombed with corrup
tion, as this State is known to be, the one
nan power might at any time erect a
throne. .-ââ â  Â»Â»?i 'â â ',
F. S. Howard ot Stanford resumed " for
the ; affirmative. He, in a general way,
kept to the point that centralization was
strength, and that France, in ber position,
must be strong to live. The Chamber of
Deputies ruled France and ' had shown
that it could rule it well? .". 7 i
E. S. Miller of Stanford, for the nega
tive, took up the points of his two oppo
nents who had 'spoken. He saw, in the
power of the Secretary of War a great
danger. If the man happened to have the
ambition and ability to back "it up be
might, , as had " been â  done in the case of
Napoleon, overturn the Government. Why
would not a new Napoleon do the same?
The impulsive temperament of tbe people
lent itself to new: ideas *â  in government;
The Chamber of Deputies was composed
of many factions, and the ambitions of in
dividuals presented opportunity for 'am-
bitions that might move for change.
Theodore de L. de Lamina of Berkeley,
also for the negative; followed; r;Centrali
zation, he said, rested upon tradition as
well as law. it subjugated Topal; govern
ment to the central government, and this
engendered carelessness in the municipali
ties with the encouragement of criticism.
Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, he
insisted. Monsieur Tame had himself
said that the. non-responsibility of local
government was a danger to the republic
itself. De Laguna's deliberate method,
destinct enunciation and rounded periods
provoked warm applause when he closed.
M. C. Flaherty of- Berkeley, for the
affirmative, completed i the first round of
the debateâ sixth. : He 1 made; bis
points by the comparisons of : history. It
was absurd ; to draw Anglo-Saxon conclu
sions from French characteristics. In
England the people Pad always opposed
the kings: and looked away from centrali
zation, while in France the people bad al
ways looked to kings. I Only centralization
could mold this people into a homogene
ous body. * * , ? '.y^L^y-^-;-
H. I). Sheldon bad six minutes in which
to start the second round. Napoleon, he
said, was dead, and the Frenchman of to
day is not the Frenchman of a hundred
years ago. The Catholic church â¢ had* lost
its grip in France. If the; leader of ; the
Chamber of Deputies showed any signs of
nurturing ambitions toward ft dictatorship
he would be unhorsed. : He must be sup
ported by a?.' majority 'of the Chamber to
remain at its head. 7 : â
!C. E. Fryer had j eight minutes for the
negative, and in 7 that time he went over
the ground covered before, insisting 7 that
centralization, ; a 7 ready call to ; arms, and
all that, was essential only in time of war,
and in time of ueace it was enervating. 'â â -"--..
m F. S. Howard, for the affirmative, in the
few minutes remaining to him, maintained
the -point that Franco presented every sign
of stability under its existing Government,
the people were evidently satisfied â¢ with
it and that is the best evidence that its
plan is best. r - * * - * 7" .7 v 7-'
-E. I. Miller, .;, for the negative, said that
the '-educational system of France was
showing the people how few were their
rights, and -they were now - preparing to
take to themselves more. They could not
long; love such: a Government,; and ; any
dictator coming into power had a ready
following. The people have now neither
civil nor political liberty, as the arms of
the / Government are only registering
bodies of his own personal will.
* Mr. de Laguna employed his time in
caustic criticism of the leader of the affirm
ative, Mr. Sheldon, which called out
laughter and applause.
M. C. Flahertv of Berkeley, for the af
firmative, closed the debate. He said that
the horrible pictures that had been drawn
of the Government of France provoked tbe
wonder not that the Government Â was
threatened with destruction, but that it
had lasted ;so - long. And yet, he â¢ said
this Government was the only one which
nad lasted twenty-one years. France must
be true to the genius of her people, he
said. Much stress had been laid upon
the effect of centralized government upon
local government. The people knew little
of local government.
Local government was the product of
evolution. It was ; a distinctly : Anglo-
Saxon growth. His peroration was effec
tive and provoked an enthusiastic burst of
applause. 7 'â¢ ' *, '
The judges retired and the Berkeley
quartet sang "And She Was Out of Sight."
. The judges returned in a few minutes
and Colonel Greenleaf, speaking for them'
said that they had unanimously agreed
upon M. C. Flaherty as the winner of the
prize. The announcement was greeted by
an uproar from Berkeley and Flaherty was
called to the stage and there formally pre
sented with the medal. â 'â "-â â 
JORDAN ON THE ACADEMY.
He Says the Academy of Sciences
Needs a Lot More
Money.
Condition 'of the Old Institution, Which
. Will Be Both Scientific and /
Popular.
David Starr Jordan," .the ; new president
of the California Academy of Sciences,
talked yesterday about the condition .and
possibilities of that somewhat venerable
institution and gave his ideas about what
could and would be done. It has been
vaguely supposed; by most people in
terested,, that the academy would now
become more recent in its style and nature.*
Dr. Jordan's first words were: 7 "The
Academy of Sciences has now an Income
of about $30,000." He talked of money
right away. He was practical as .usual.
During recent fierce political storms in
the institution, there was much brilliant
talk about the good and great and pro
gressive things the academy ought to do
and ' be. . Dr. .Jordan is right out in
the skirmish line of educational - and
sciehtificprogress, but it. is, evident that
when the presidency was offered to him
and* the first thought about what might
be done, he at once asked: "How much
money have you?" .'He says that the
academy hasn't money enough to branch
out much, and he hopes that the dying
rich will give it more.
He wants the original scientific work of
the academy to be hustled to the best of
its limited possibilities, and there are to be
bi-monthly scientific lectures high in class,
but so popular in theme ;' and treatment
that the lecture audiences of the academy,
which have for a generation ranged in at
tendance from 13 to 34, will constitute one
of the most popular and valuable lecture
courses of the City. , ;V";..*.t." s
"The Academy of Sciences has now an
income of about $30,000, and can do certain
things. The things the academy can do
appear to reduce themselves to three.
"First, the publication of its proceed
ings.:, These publications consist of state
ments of additions to scientific knowledge
made by its members or others engaged in
the study of its material or 'of scientific
matters pertaining to this coast. Since
tbe development of the scientific staffs of
two universities there has ' been a great
amount jof | this material, so * that during
the past two years the published 1 proceed
ings of the academy have compared favor
ably with those of any similar "institution.
"The second 'â - item :of the academy's
work is original , investigation by paid
curators working in certain fields.. For
this there is but > little money, I , might
state -. that * the academy's * endowment is
about $600,000, including mainly. its build
ing and a mortgage for $100,000 on Catalina
Island. Its expenses are about as follows :
Salaries, $10,800; taxes, so3so; publications,
$5000; ; periodicals, $1000; 'â  maintenance of
property, $3000; books, materials, etc..
$2000. So you see* how the work of original
investigation is limited. v There is little
money for expeditions and special investi
gations. In either of the two universities
the departments of : physics and chemistry
together spend yearly more money than
the whole income of the academy. â¢ ".
"The maximum salary paid any curator
is $1000, while in a similar position intone
of the universities a man capable of teach
ing and investigating would get $2000 to
$2500. , The curatorships are mainly tem
porary steps to bright young men. "Pro
fessor Lpomis,": in charge of the ; depart
ment of ? ornithology, is ; an exceptionally
bright and capable man, and others there
are very good.
7 "The" academy 7 would \ like to extend its
work; to geology, mineralogy, insects,
crabs' and star-fishes, bacteria â and mam
mals. But for all this work there is no
money. ,'â¢-'-; â¢:. .'-.:..â .
J "Popular lectures - are the third proper
work of Â« the academy. They should be
statements , by authority of what truth is?
and their scope should be wide, covering
all the applications of science. We want
to make these lectures intelligible to com
mon audiences, and I would like to draw
in the working men; if possible. There is
no reason why there 6hould be only twenty
or thirty people to hear.' an Academy of.
Sciences â¢ lecture. expect .to arrange . for
an explanation and demonstration of the
recent : discoveries by .Professor Roentgen
and others working in similar lines.- But
little of such popular worn has been done
by : any American " academies rof science.
In'*, Europe, t and J especially in 7 England;
they have I gone '. much further. : The 'â  pri
mary a purpose sof : all .* suoh i societies has
been the publication of original research,
but it has seemed to me .that", the publica
tions might be one thing and the meet
ings another." A? 7 7 v â¢
Origin of the Mint Onlep.
:-.'â  The ; mint julep got '. its name : from a
Southern gentleman who was *a 7 great ad
mirer, of Shakespeare's *(, works, and '* who,
upon an occasion after having tried "grass
in his likker," was so moved by the result
that there came to his mind a vision of
his favorite heroine, the daughter of t -* Lady
Capulet â ; and the * "sweet p, sweeting'* ..V of
Romeo; ;' â  thereupon 7he enthusiastically
named the. beverage '"mint Juliet," a
term which latter bibbers -have * corrupted

watchman at J. T. Moran's clothing-store

to look like a watchman who was just
waiting for somebody to break in '"â  and , get
shot. Now it has to stand up night and

a new suit of clothes and ;an unrelenting
upright collar. : But Mr. , Moran thinks
that the dummy saved his store and he is

in one district. Now it is cut in two at
Paru street and each piece forms a part of
a separate district,; the Supervisor gener
ally coming from outside this ' city. The
dividing or Alameda was the result of an
effort made in 1884 by a Democratic board'
to so gerrymander the county as to keep the
political complexion of the board the
same, notwithstanding the fact that the
county at each . general election was over

HOW HURLEY WAS KILLED
Coroner's Jury ; on the Victim of

908 Broadway, Feb. 7. ]
The search into tbe ruins of the wrecked
Williams building was. completed . to-day
and all doubts as ;, to there being anybody
buried beneath the debris were dispelled.
â  The : inquest was V held th is evening â¢on
the body of young Hurley, who was killed
while trying :to escape yesterday. His
father was too much affected by his sorrow
to appear and it was decided to dispense
with his testimony. ? .7 7??'??
7 Herbert E. Jones, the contractor, testi
fied to ; the general 7 construction of the
building. X He said that he had framed the
plans himself and that in doing so he had
followed the same rules by which he had
been guided during a long experience as a
contractor. He told of the dimensions of the
; bracings and : said ; that possibly same of
the carpenters had' removed ; the" bracings
contrary. to his orders before the building
was safe. 7 ; '--7-'> : '-- ?"
i In answer to questions Jones stated that
he had personally, conducted the construc
tion of the building and bad not left any
of tbe responsibility to any one else.'.'v'-r.t-*
'*-.'. P. Judson, a carpenter employed on the
building, said -""j there p was *a" very 7 high
wind and 'â  that one bard . gust struck the

would i have been had the -building: not

ports had 7 not 7 been strong enough the
building would 7 have ; quivered '*â  for some
time before toppling over. ; The ' accident
was the work of a few seconds.77 * * c . > '
; Mr.7 Smith, a contractor, testified that
the building was too large for the lot and
that the overhanging parts made it top
heavy. : Ho ) said i that * the plans did 7 not
provide for sufficiently heavy timbers. It
was 1 learned % during L bis i testimony * that
Smith had been a bidder on the building
and that his bid was not accepted. 'â â -.
" J. McDonald, who had such v ; a narrow
escape, said that* the accident was instan
taneous and attributed it to the wind.

liberating on its verdict. After 7 finding

Fabrics From Peat Fiber.

of various textile fabrics woven* from peat
fibers i and closely - resembling? tho well
known Scotch tweed i. and camel's 1 hair?
These * specimens were received from *, the

and indicate the industrial possibilities of
that material. Formerly peat fiber was
not considered available practically in any
manufactures of utility, especially, in, such
a line, but it is now well understood 5 that
it can be bleached to a snowy whiteness
and will take any dye, a special advantage
of ; such cloth j** as claimed, â  being its j anti
septic character and freedom from harbor?

near the park entrance, by William Eadie,
a driver in the employ of 'B. McDer

about 140 pounds. The clothing is of fairly
good material, and, like the linen, is scru
pulously clean. The body was dressed in
a cutaway suit of black cheviot and a black
overcoat. 7He wore a white shirt with a
turned-down collar, a small lawn-bow tie
of white? striped with a black line.
; The clothing and features of the man are
those of one who belongs -to the higher
walks of life. The hands are soft: and
small. The hair is quite gray, and some
what thin around the temples. The face
is clean shaven, except a heavy 'iron-gray
mustache. Nothing was found on the per
son to indicate who he was or whence
he came. â  There was not a bit of paper or
a scratch of a pen found about him.
7 A pair of walking gloves were found in
the man's overcoat pocket. There was a
clean white linen handkerchief m his un
dercoat, and a pair of eyeglasses in the
vest pocket. In the watch-pocket was
found ; a small silver â¢ watch, with gold
chain, while in the front of the shirt there
was a small plain gold stud. The ; watch
was running when the body was found.
There is no indication of poisoning.
The whole affair is a mystery, and is
likely to be one more to add to the long
list of those bodies found in that vicinity
for which there has never been any ex

BURIED Iff A TREE.
Grave of a German Statesman Discov
Â«red in a Hollow Oak.
One of the most curious mausoleums in
the world was discovered the other day in
an orchard at the village of Noebdenitz in
Saxe-Altenbnrg.
A gigantic old oak tree, which a storm
had robbed of its crown, was up for public
auction. Among the bidders* happened to
be Baron yon Thummel. The Baron, who
lives on a neighboring estate, bad ridden
to the auction place quite accidentally. As
no one seemed eager to help out the auc
tioneer, he started the bidding at a small
figure. This aroused the peasants' suspi
cion; they thought there might be some
value in this old tree, and the battle raged
for an, hour, until finally the tree was
knocked down to the Baron for $50. â¢
Upon his arrival at the castle he told an
old servant of his purchase, describing the
tree and ; its situation. The old servant
said he remembered attending the funeral
of a Baron Thummel seventy or eighty
years ago, and that the body ' had been
buried in a 1000-year-old oak then standing
on a plat of ground belonging to the par
sonage. Â-....
: Investigation proved that the orchard had
once been the property of the village
church, and that at one side of the old oak
was an iron shutter, rusty and â¢ time-worn,
that the people of the village had always
supposed to have been placed there by
some joker or miscbieveous boys.
The iron shutter proved to be the gate to
the mausolcm of Baron Hans Wilhelm yon
Thummel, at one time Minister of State of
Saxe-Altenburg," who died in 1824 and
wished to be buried "in the 1000-year-old
tree he loved so well."
The oak, which measures about ten feet
in diameter." has for over a century been
hollow, so it was learned, beginning at a
point about five feet above its base. In this
hollow | Baron I Hans caused to be built a
sepulcher of solid masony large enough to
accommodate his coffin. : .* . v<U *
The coffin was "' placed there, as the
church : records show, on March 3, 1824,
and the opening was closed; by an iron
gate.- In the course of time a wall of wood
grew . over \ the ; opening, which - had been
enlarged to admit t 1 c coffin and workmen,
and for many years it has been completely
shut, thus removing the last vestige of the
odd use rto which the old tree had been
put.â St. Louis Globe-Democrat

NOTHING BUT FAVORITES.
The Bookmakers Kept Busy
Cashing Winning Tickets
at Ingleside.
LEVENA C AGAIN A WINNER.
â ?eter II Won One of the Prettiest
Contested Races Seen on a
Local Course.
The bookmakers met with a Waterloo at
Ingleside yesterday. Five pronounced
first choices headed their fields past ithe
finishing post, and as all were heavily
backed it was not to be wondered at that
the pencilers suffered from a feeling of
ennui toward dusk. Rather an off day,
the attendance was hardly up to the aver
age, but there was no lack of coin in the
ring.
Starter Caldwell was without his assist
ant yesterday, but sent the fields away
quickly and In fine order.
One of the prettiest contests ever wit
nessed on a local course was furnished in
the mile dash. There were eight starters,
with Peter the Second ruling an 8 to 5
favorite. Little Bob was a warm second
choice at twos, with a rambling play on
Model, Polaski, Ike L and Tar and Tartar.
Sent away to a fair start, the order was
strangling until well straightened away
down the backstretcb. The tail-enders
then closed up on the leaders, and from the
half until well around the bend for home
a blanket would nearly have covered the
entire bunch.
Below the furlong pole the favorite drew
away from the others and passed the stand
a length in front of Ike L, who, driving,
beat Leonville a neck for the place.
Pittsburg Phil and his friends "Killed"
the ring on the live-furlong selling scram
ble that his fast mare Derfargilla started
in. Opening at even money she was ham
mered down to 1 to 2 at post time. Tim

Murphy was a mild second choice, with all
of the other starters quoted at ; long odds.
The field broke to a running start? Â»ith
Perhaps away in the lead. Tne little brown
horse set a merry clip to the stretch, with
the balance fairly well bunched at his
heels. â¢â  â .:'â¢â ' â â /'/' x.
Lamley on the favorite, who had been
hugging the . rail and was 7 apparently
hemmed in, drew away when squared for
the wire and won easily? with Lizzie H in
the place. Perhaps hung on gamely, fin
ishing third. .
After betting had progressed for some
minutes on the opening race of the day, a
six-furlong dash, Mr. Reel, the second
choice, was scratched, and twenty min
utes were allowed for anew book. Meadow
Lark was now a hotter favorite than ever,
gome to the post at evens. 7He was in
front the greater part of the way, winning
cleverly by a length. In a drive Wirambo
took the place from Senator Bland by a
head.
The Cambridge stable's Red Glen had
shown such a high turn of speed in his
previous race at the Bay District that a
great rush was made to get aboard when
the bookies chalked 4to 5 against him. In
a poor position during the early part of the
running, he drew away from the field in

race, being beaten out for the place by
Pique.
Levena C annexed another purse for her
owner in the third event, a four-furlong

second * choice, Mobolasca. . Pecksniff
again got inside the money, finishing third.
Track and Paddock Items.
The Governor Budd stake, one mile and
a half, worth $1500 to the winner, should
attract a big crowd of racegoers to Ingle
side track to-day. It â¢ will be an equine
test of endurance and speed well worth
witnessing. Both Cadmus and Claudius,
the favorites, are reported to be in fine
fettle, and over a fast track the winner is
liable to have to clip a fraction off the
coast record. ,
Mr. Wibaux? the Montana turf devotee,
denies the rumor circulated that he is in
the habit of carrying large sums of money
about his person. He says that his word
is sufficient whenever he wishes to make a
wager, and that his losses, if any, are set
tled with, a check.
Much curiosity has been exhibited by
racegoers to see the Grey Australian

I A mangy, 7 half-starved J canine looking
for a bone to gnaw on about represents the
plight the keepers of the pool-selling dens
downtown are in. They are endeavoring
to keep una bold front and are extending
the skeleton hand of welcome to the de
luded ' mortals ' that, satiated with 'â¢ an un
controllable desire to gamble, stand g ready
to commit almost any crime on the f calen
dar ;to '-j gather together a few dollars to
satisfy this desire. $
As the swindling methods of . the sharp
ers running these "joints" are exposed the
better class of bettors ".that formerly fre
quented them are now "noticeable by their
absence. Yesterday there was sad con
fusion in the "commission joints." After
two races had been run off at Ingleside ac
cording to programme the management
decided to call the fifth race. , Affairs in
the poolrooms were then. in such an ap
palling state that ' ' "Messansanger & Co."
were unable to extricate them from the
dilemma. Information from the track
was as scarce as corn beef and cabbage at
an Italian rotisaiere, and it is safe to pre
dict that to-day the downtown play will
be very light.
THE LABOR COUNCIL.
Elected J. F. Burn* as a Delegate to
the Good-Roads Meeting and In
stalled New Officers.
The, Labor Council met last night and
unanimously elected its vice-president, T.
F. Burns, a member of the Cigar-makers'
Union, to represent the council at the
preliminary good-roads meeting to be
held in this City on the 13th of this month.
A delegate from the Sailors' Union re
ported that trade in his department is
better than it has been for. some time. He
added that during the last week the un
usual thing had happened in a jury's
having found the master of the American
snip N. P. Grace guilty of cruelty for club
bing a sailor in irons.
Trade among the electrical workers was
declared to be very brisk and none of the
men out of employment. The union has
engaged the Odd Fellows' Hall in which to
give an entertainment this month, a fea
ture to be an elaborate electrical display.
As an expression of appreciation of his
long ana untiring advocacy of the cause
of united labor, the council voted to pre
sent retiring Financial Secretary William
Zahn of the Brewery Workmen's Union
with a complimentary letter engrossed on
parchment. Zahn will shortly leave for
Mexico.
Next Friday evening the meeting of the
council will be united with the convention
of trades and labor organizations,. to be
held at 1159 Mission street.
Last night's meeting closed with the in
stallation of regular officers, elected at the
subsequent meeting. V

operations : No record like that has
been on the police books of any city in
this country before, it- is believed, and
the moralists are trying to study out the
causes that led up to these crimes,
with -the conditions that made them
possible. Several persons have already
interested, themselves -in an endeavor
to keep the boys out of the State prison,
asserting that the Reform School is the
proper place for them. In whatever -way
it may be regarded, the case is conceded
to be both startling and remarkable.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 7. [
The boy burglars were in trie Police
Court this morning. When they entered
a hush fell over the packed lobby.
Instead of two desperate hoodlums, the
crowd saw two neatly-dres3ed , boys walk
in ahead of Officer Ccrtiss. They sat down
beside. their attorney, and there was a
feeling of curiosity expressed on both their
faces. They had not seen each other since
they were arrested, and neither knew what
the other had said. There was no indica
tion of. nervousness, and as their attorney,
Ned Ayer., pleaded for them, they had not
a word to say. *
Two charges have been sworn to. ,' One
charges the boys with the Girard affair,
and the other with the Miller & Butler
job, from which they were returning when
arrested. The examination into the first
Charge was set for Monday next; the
second one was made out in the name
of Ford, Majors' alias, and a new com
plaint will have to be filed. The proceed
ings occupied about ten minutes, and the
boys were Jed back to their cells. '
. The point of greatest interest in the case
is tbat concerning Mrs. Willmore. the
mother of . the younger boy. She protests
her innocence, but she has told some con
tradictory stories, and the Chief of Police
believes that she must have known what
the boys were doing. The lads had been
making nightly predatory raids for over
three' weeks, and have stored the proceeds
in many parts of the house; and yet Mrs.
o Willmore says she never; knew that the
boys were not in bed all night and never
noticed them with more money than
Major had told her he received from a
relative in the East.
Mrs. Majors-Wagner, the mother of Abe
Majors, blames Mrs. Willmore for all the
troubles that have * befallen her. Mrs.
Willmore denies it, arid the stories of the
two women as printed below, while they
may not carry conviction in either case,
still they show a state of affairs that must
have added very materially to the de
moralization of the youthful burglars.
Thousands of people , have visited the
police station since the lads were arrested

were the "actual burglars the facts in the
case would not be believed. '
The affair has created more sensation
than anything that has . transpired in this
city since a gatling gun .was put at the en
trance to the City Hall two years ago 7to
repel an expected attack by the Industrial
Army. : Ministers have given notice of their
intention to preach from the lessons taught
by the strange features of the crimes, and
many have already, expressed their opin
ions in print. f 7
It is a circumstance worthy of note that
not a single burglary or robbery was re
ported to the police to-day as having taken
place last night. "7 * 7 " '. :
The Police Department, according to an
official statement to-night, is now satisfied
that Mrs. Willmore was an : accessory to
the crimes of the boys who lived at her
house. Four months ago Archie j Majors
went to the Chief of Police and told him of
things that were going on in the Willmore
household, and he advised Mrs. Sanford to '
get the girl* Ina away ' and; he offered to !
help her. â¢ 7 â¢77
â '.. Archie went away,- and as he was the j
only witness who . would " testify against
Mrs. Willmore the matter could not be
pressed... .-.- y77//7 7* '"â¢ ' '7/y
. Archie 7 asked the Chief to protect his
younger brother, Abe, and the matter was
thoroughly investigated, but without
Archie nothing could be proved. Since
that time the boys have been leading a life
of crime, and many thing's point to the fact
that Burt Willmore's * mother knew all
about it. Her immediate arrest is consid
ered certain. 7 ."V

The; beginning of ' this affair dates back
two years. ' Then my trust was God and
those who professed Christianity. Several
evenings a 'week I took my children and

There I met Mrs. Willmore arid her daugh

was led to believe that she was my truest
friend. I depended* on her as I should
have depended on my sister. *
"I even went so far as to confide in her
that my children and I were the rightful
heirs to a large estate in New York, and I
foolishly showed * her my legal papers arid
correspondence with the Eastern lawyers.
At this time my son Abe was employed by
the news agent at the Alameda mole, earn

boarders to help out. â¢ .7. -/ ".
7 "Abe was a member of, the Young Men's
Christian Association and a model boy in

home, and every one spoke ' "of his tender

intimacy threw Abe and Mrs..Willmore's
daughter Ina together. 71. thought noth

the fact' that Mrs.' Willmore was gradually
enticing my boy from home. At last she
I
succeeded until he was a slave to her will
even to forget those he . once , loved better
than his own life. .When I sought him he
disappeared. I pleaded on my knees with
the wrecker of my home to tell me his
whereabouts. She refused. ". '
. "The story of Mrs. Sanford's bringing
him back to Oakland from Fresno has

--"I am not *in hiding," said Mrs. Will-,
more to-night, "as my attorney has told
Chief Lloyd that he will bring me to him
whenever he desires.'?* I have merely come
out here to avoid the bother that I should
be put to. if I stayed at : home. Ido not
know anything . whatever of all this
trouble, and feel very much the disgrace
that has been cast upon me. * '.'- :
â¢ "I did riot know what the boys had in

never saw the boys with- much money. 7 In

Majors had r some occasionally, but never
very. much. He told me he was getting it
from a relative in the East, and I believed
him. Tnere was {never anything in my
boy's room to lead me to believe that any
thing was wrong. I neVer saw weapons or
tools or any stolen article in there," and I
was in it every day. ',' : 7.7 7 77;?
. "The boys used to go to bed at a decent
time every night, and I do not recollect
that they were ever out very late. They
sometimes went to parties and have come
home about midnight, but never later. I
suppose! that after I was asleep they must
have got up and gone out and have re
turned before I got up in the morning.
Sometimes I may, have been deceived, for
I have learned that they used to fix up the
bed so that if I looked in at the window I
should think they were asleep. 7 Probably
I have often thought the boys were in bed
when as a matter, of fact they were out.
When the officers came yesterday morn
ing for. that chest in the coalshed I thought
the boys were in bed, and 1 went in to tell
them what was going on. I saw then how
they had fixed their pillows, and it was
then that .: I feared ' I must have been de
ceived in the past. '.-â  ? {
"I do not think it reasonable to suppose
that I knew what they were doing. If I
had known that the lads were out commit
ting burglaries it. would not have been
necessary for them to have deceived me by
making dummies. I have been out work
ing for $1 a day for \ several months past,
and have been able to pay my way with
care. The rent of this house is only $8 a
month, and; Abe sometimes paid me some
money for his board.
"Mrs. Wagner's stories about my enticing
the boy, Abe, from home are fakes. The
boy came here and said it was impossible
for him to live at home and that he wanted
to be with Burt, and I let them share the
same room."
ARCHIE MAJORS.
Mrs. Willmore Said to Have In
fluenced Him, Too, Against
His Mother.
Archie Major's? the brother of Abe, re
turned from Texas arid New Mexico, where
he had been a cowboy for over a year.
Seven months ago he came to his mother
as a penitent prodigal son in rags, and
wearing rubbers to cover his feet. Mrs.
Wagner took all the money she possessed
and fitted him out comfortably in clothing,
and while he sought work she took in
washing from : . a lodgine-house, work far
befondher strength, to support her family.
Archie was then kind to his mother and
worked in harmony with her and those
who were : trying to locate- his brother.
After two months' search for work he got
a situation with Fox & Andrews' creamery
to drive a milk wagon at wages of $30 a
month,* he said, giving Mrs. Wagriers2oa
month'for board and room. With this ar
rangement his mother was well satisfied.
All at once Archie became! irritable and
abusive to the Wagner children, and upon
Mrs. Wagner's 7 return, one evening two
months ago, she found Archie gone and
the house robbed of several articles of
value. â¢ â 'â 'â '' -? 1 ' . . ' .7 â¢
Archie had even stripped the blankets
from his : mother's bed. Investigation
proved that he had left home again/that
the position he held at the creamery had
been secured by Mrs. Willmore for some
one else, and tbat Archie had been receiv
ing $40 instead of $30.
Mrs. 7 Willmore, the day he left home,
had collected part .of his wages, on what
she claimed to be a board bill. Mrs. Wag
ner went to his employers, but they * re
fused to believe her and accepted Archie's
version of affairs.
Mrs. Wagner then proceeded, through
the aid of an attorney, to serve a notice on
the firm , not. to pay . the young fellow/ s
wages to any one but her. This angered
Archie, and he gave up his position, and
his former â " employers refuse to | divulge
where he went, saying they belieVe him
wronged by his mother. "?.:.. ;
The last seen of him he was in company
with Mrs. Willmore. in Judge Seawell's

It Was a Dilapidated Shed at the
Back. of the Willmore
House. 7
The Willmore v home is a cozy, little
building in the rear of 1264 Webster street.
It has the appearance of having originally
been a small â¢ house of worship. It has
evidently been moved into the rear of {the
lot to make room -for the more pretentious
building that now stands in front of it.
The Willmore house cannot 'be seen from
the sidewalk. {?
â "-'â  At the back of the lot is the, rough shed
in which the boys stored their tools and
some of the plunder. It is a ramshackle
place and is falling to ] pieces. It contains
a lot of , old rubbish and in one corner was
a small rifle. The first thing to greet the
eye ;! is a book of j children's 1 hymns, the
covers of which have disappeared. 7 There .
is a pile of old books, but the most sensa
tional was one of productions.
There was no dime-novel -literature: in
sight and neither was the wall ornamented
with cigarette photographs. 7
The chest that is now 7in the City
Prison was at the : extreme back of the
shed: facing the -right-hand door ; hole.
It was hastily covered with wood and rub
bish, and would not have attracted atten
tion, as.it is old and scarred and seemed
particularly? well suited to the other con
tents of the room.

Young Majors Says Mrs. Willmore
Knew All About His Coming
Marriage.
Mrs. Willmore's story is. not entirely
borne out by what she has previously said
and by the statements of Abe Majors. She
said yesterday that she had known young
Majors only about three weeks and that
she knew nothing of his antecedents, and
that she knew him by the name of Ford.
About six months ago there appeared in
The -; Call a story about the Wagner fam
ily, and at the time Mrs. Willmore was
interviewed â  and asked why she was add
ing to :: the \ troubles of the Majors boys.
She gave indifferent replies, but the mat
ter was referred to the Humane Society
and police, and although nothing was'
done, it is believed by the police that Mrs.
Willmore knew who her sou's companion
was and whence he came. .
â y When asked, to-day why he had claimed
tbat j his J name was Ford, young Majors
said: "I did not want my mother to know
that 1 { was back ; here {again . I left my
mother because she made life unbearable
for me at home.' She took every cent I
earned. 1 went to live at Willmore's after
this, but Mrs. Willmore did not entice me
away, as claimed by ray mother. Finally
I was compelled to leave town because my
mother bothered me so. While away I
took the name of Ford, and when I came
back here I went by the name of < Ford so
that my mother could not find me out. I
have not seen her since I came back, about
a month ago." ;
â¢ Regarding this matter, Mrs. Prescott ,
secretary of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, stated that the at
tention of the - Humane Society had : been
called to the case of Mrs. Wagner, the
boy's mother, after her son had left her
horhe. .{â **â  They found that Mrs. Wagner was
a deserving woman, and it seemed to them
that she should - receive a portion of the
earnings of â¢ her, son at least. ,It had been
reported to them that he was spending his
money on Ina Willmore, the 13-year-old
daughter of Mrs. Willmore. Some time
after this the boy went to Fresno, and at
the request of ' Mrs. â¢' Wagner was brought
back by the society, but afterward was al
lowed to go back.
' Mrs. Prescott said further that she had
been watching ' for Majors' return to this
city again, and was not aware that he was
here until she learned of his arrest. Be
fore the fact was learned that young Ford
was Majors yesterday, Mrs. Prescott called
on Mrs. .';. Will more 7 and ? requested 7 her to
tell where Majors was. *Mrs. Prescott ; said
that Mrs.Willmore replied to her questions
evasively, and she did not learn from her
that Â«; the boy â¢* arrested : with her own son
was the one she was in "search" of. ? "7-":
This afternoon young Majors told an mi
i teresting story of his connection /with the
Willmore family and it increases the opin
.ion of Chief Lloyd that Mrs. Willmore
knows more than she has yet told. ?
".. "I was 7 engaged 7to'. be " married !to Ina
Willmore," said Abe, "and was only wait
ing : until 7my eighteenth birthday and
i until 1 got more money, so that we could .
get married. Mr?. Willmore knew of our
engagement and she also knew that I had
given Ina an engagement ring. Mrs. Will
more knew well- enough who I was and
she knew * who my mother was arid how
my father died. I was trying to raise
money so that I could get married, but I
did tell Mrs. Willmore that 1 was getting
money from the East? â¢', I' do not think she
knew what we have been doing lately, but
some months ago when The/Call pub
lished some stories about our family we
used to talk â¢ about them and Mrs. Will
more need not' pretend she has forgotten
them." ; "" â¢*" â¢ ".'.â { â¢â¢. ! "
Chief of Police Lloyd is still of the opin
ion that Mrs. Willmore knew what the
boys ' were doing, > and *in support of this
belief Detective Holland says that when
the house was searched the mother knew
the location of everything, in, the posses
sion of the young cracksmen and that she
always had more money than the boys
could earn. â¢
HEREDITY THEORY.

Majors Denies' That His Father's
Fate Caused His Bad
Career. .
The fact that one of the boys proved to
be the son of Lloyd Majors, who â â¢ was
hanged here in 1884, gives an opportunity
too- theories of .heredity and about the
young fellow being forced into' a career of
crime on account of the ignominy of his
father's name.
Young Majors was asked to-day if the
report concerning the latter was true, and
jhe said that there was nothing in it. He
had not been taken with remorse on
account : of the manner of . his father's
death, and this had nothing at all to do
with hi_ starting out to burglarize. A
The crime for which Lloyd Majors waW
hanged was that of planning the murdefr
of an old Frenchman near Los Gatos. 7 Ait
the time Majors kept a saloon at Los
Gatos with a man of the name of Jewell.
The latter, and one Showers, were the
actual murderers, although Majors fin
ished the job by setting fire to the French
man's cabin, burning up the remains.
Their object in murdering the man was
to obtain his; money, and they tortured
him in an effort to make him tell where it
was. ' ....*'*. â¢ \
Majors was first tried in Santa Clara,
but when a new .trial was ordered he ob
tained a change of venue .to this county,
where he was also convicted. While
awaiting the death penalty he broke out of
jail once by overpowering his jailers, but
was recaptured by the firemen at the
Sixth-street engine-house.
The police have found two more pistols
which Majors and Willmore had secreted
under the mattress in their bed. These
pistols are good-sized ones, but not so
large as those found on the boys when ar
rested.' â¢ 7 '
Majors declared to the â¢ officers who ar
rested them that he would have used his
big pistol on them if they had not got the
drop by drawing their own pistols.
The Shipment of Sugar.
The bag -has displaced both the. hogs
head and the barrel in the shipment of re
fined and raw sugars. There was a time,
not so very long. ago,. when such a thing
as shipping sugar in anything but a stave
made vessel was unheard of. but now it is
just the other way. The bag has become
popular because it is cheaper, and con
tinues to grow cheaper, while the wooden
receptacles advance in price at .about the
same ratio. Even molasses has gone back
on the stave, and that sticky commodity
is being carried in bulk.â Philadelphia
