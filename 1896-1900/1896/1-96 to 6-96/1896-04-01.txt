' ' . HAVANA, Cuba, March 31.âIntelli

- Government troops. On March 24 an in
surgent force of nearly 2000 men, led by
Varona, Sosa and others, surprised a. Â«1 at
tacked the Wadras battalion between
tuana and La Fe, in" the province of Pinar
si Rio. The battalion was convoying a
rain of army supplies. Five hundred
cbels first attacked the vanguard of the
sovernm v nt force, and later 400 men at
tacked the rearguard, which was then re-
I inforced.
Another attempt was then made on the
i vanguard and left flank, and the troops
! *vere compelled to form a square to resist
: :ta'i attack. Cavalry was also used in the
attempt to hold the rebels in check, but
without avail. After a hot fight the troops
, were compelled to retreat. They lost
many killed and wounded.
Throughout the fight and during the re
treat of the troops the insurgents used
their machetes with deadly effect. The
greater part of the convoy fell into the
hands of the rebels. Many oxen that
were destined for : the use of the troops
were killed by the extreme heat. With
the convoy "â¢ were seventy-four sick and
wounded Spaniards.
The official report says, of course, that
the troops won the "fight and that the
rebels lost thirty killed, among whom was
an ex-sergeant of the civil guard.
The same battalion had an engagement
with a rebel force at Lazo Fajado on
March 14. in which the rebel.: are said to
have lost twenty killed and wounded.

Among them is the mother of the rebel
leader,' Perez. The women' were acting as
nurses. The troops destroyed all the equip

camp. \
Insurgents are said to have blown up

dynamite.
It is stated night that Walter Grant

he was "Inglesito," a notorious bandit,

CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, March
31.â J. W. Biddle, secretary, and in ab
sence of Minister Terrill, Charge d'Affaires
of the United States Legation, has made a
vigorous protest to the Porte against the
action of the Turkish Governor of Bitlis in
ordering the immediate arrest of Messrs.
Cole and Knapp, American missionaries,
and he accompanied the protest with a
threat to sever diplomatic relations with
the Porte unless the Government was re
voked. Biddle's protest was indorsed by
Sir Philip Curric. the British Embassador.
The Porte .yielded to the protest, and
gave instructions to the Governor of Bitlis ,
to permit Mr. Knapp to remain in Bitlis.
The Governor was instructed in the case of
Cole to allow that gentleman to act as he
pleases and to perform missionary work
without hindrance. It is regarded as
likely here that the action of the Governor

mier Bourgeois in regard to the recent de

Madagascar were controlled by France.
In regard to Egypt M. Bourgeois recalled

SLAIN BY THOSE IMPLICATED.
One \ Clew Tnat May Lead to j the* Dis
covery of the Perpetrators of ;
the Murder. t
CHICAGO, 111., March 31.â The corpse
of the man found in the packing case a
week ago is that of Oliver Pike, who mys
teriously disappeared from Seattle in July,
1892. He went from his home in Fayette,
Ohio, to Washington six years ago. -
The solution of the identity of the mys
tery, which was complicated by the posi
tive claim that the body was that of Joan
nes Prosper Chazel, was accomplished by
the testimony of the murdered man's
uncle, William M. Doriot, and the form
er's cousin, given before the Coroner's
jury this afternoon at the County Morgue.
Upon this testimony and the evidence of
the County Physician, the jury found that
the body before them was that of Oliver
Pike, and that he had been murdered by
a blunt instrument, inflicting two frac
tures of his skull, and that the murderer
was unknown.
Coroner .McHale gave an. order to Mr.
Doriot to take the remains of his nephew
from the city for burial. The body was
legally proved to be that of Pike, Iby the
feet, hands, hair and teeth and by the
truss which was worn by 1 . the murdered
man and found in = the trunk. The truss
was sufficiently cleaned by chemicals to
allow the experts to tell the "support was
not manufactured in France but in this
country, and on that proof fell the claims
of the friends of the missing Frenchman,
Chased, who disappeared from Salt Lake
February 7. 1893, the day before the ex
press box was shipped from that city to
Chicago.
The apparent fatal discrepancy between
the time of Pike's disappearance from
Seattle and the time the body was shippea
from Salt Lake was cleared by the admis
sion of Mr. Doriot on the stand that he
had made a mistake of a year. This would
agree with the shipping time from Salt
Lakeâ February, 1893. ' â¢ X ,
A possible clew is to be found in the fact
that Pike was employed as an attendant
at the '; Steilacoom Insane Asylum : for a
short time soon after his arrival in Wash
ington and that he was discharged : the
fall of 1890 after certain alleged scandals
and abuses had occurred at the institution,
of which Pike had an innocent knowledge,
it is said. Just before he disappeared he
was living in Seattle at the home of O.
M/ Jones, an old .friend. He left the
Jones house July 3 to meet friends who
were coming from Port Blakeley to spend
the "Fourth," and that is the last seen or
heard of him.
The friends of Chazel were sorely dis
appointed when the result ; of the inquest
was announced. , They say. he ; was mur
dered by "Jule, the assassin," in Salt Lake
for robbery. â¢

Double Life of the Late
Joseph E. Bachelder
Exposed.
TWO WIDOWS MOURNING
For Thirty Years He Had Lived
With One and Corresponded
With the Other.
BOTH AFTER HIS PROPERTY.
Letters cf Administration Granted to
the First Wifeâ Conspiracy Is
Alleged.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 31.â A re
markable story of the double marriage of
an old resident of this county and the de
ception of ' two women for nearly thirty
years was brought out in the Superior
Court here yesterday. It was revealed by
the application ; of Louisa Bachelder for
letters of administration on the estate of
Joseph E. Bachelder.
The deceased was a well-known charac
ter of Guerneville and left an estate,.con
sisting of five or six ; houses and lota in
that town, valued at about $4000. From
the rental â¢of these houses : "Old Batch"
and "Granny Batch," as they were com
monly called, derived a comfortable living
for many years. They have no children,
and when the old gentleman died, leaving
no will. "Granny" considered herself the
sole heir. Her consternation when con
fronted by another aged lady claiming to
be the old man's legal wife can be imag
ined.
The newcomer produced the documents
proving that Lucy ; Steel and James E.
Bachelder were legally united in mar
riage in the State of Wisconsin during the
year J- 1849.'.'; She further! proved that they
had lived as man and wife . for fourteen
years, having as issue of the marriage two
children. From letters ; in the possession
of wife No. 1 it was found that a regular
correspondence had been kept up between
her and Bachelder from the ; time he left
her, in 1864, to the year 1891. After "Old
Batch" ' ceased writing to her she started
for California and took up her residence in
Sari* Francisco. 1 ; j Mrs. Bachelder' then be
came aware of her husband's second matri
monial venture, but made no effort to
separate him from his second wife. :
Wife No. 2 has records to â  prove that she
was married to the old man in 1867.
On the showing made v the court granted
the letters of administration to wife No. 1.
Now, the second Mrs. Bachelder proposes
to bring suit to declare. the property in the
hands of the administratrix a trust for the
plaintiff's benefit, 'on the grounds that her
money bought the property in dispute. /. â¢
Mrs.' Bachelder No. 1 was represented by
Attorney Thomas Bachelder of '. San Fran
cisco, add the interests ' of ' No. . 2 were in
the hands of Attorney T. J. Butts of this
City. From the latter gentleman" the '
plaintiff's contentions in the coming suit'
are learned. She will admit the first mar
riage and its legality, and declare that the i
second marriage was a deep-laid plot on/
the part of the.dead man and his brother,/
the attorney, to gain possession of the ,
property now -being fought over, or the'
money that purchased it..
According to her story, when "Old
Batch" had crossed the plains, and landed
in San Francisco in 1861 he was the posse*
sor of property valued at several thousand
dollars. This he deeded :to his brother
Thomas, the attorney, taking the-latter's
note for â which, by the way, was
never paid. This was done, it is alleged,
to defraud the second wife.
. - Shortly â¢ after this . Louisa Lorenson
applied to Attorney Bochelan for -legal
assistance in obtaining a divorce from
Peter Lorenson. The divorce was success
fully obtained and the court awarded
Louisa $50 a month : alimony. About four

months thereafter Peter Lorenson died in
Healdsburg;, and the divorced wife, sup
pressing the divorce, set herself up as the
dead man's widow. By this means she
obtained about $4000 belonging by ri:ht
to L.orenson's daughter. It was to obtain
control of thismonev that Bachebier
renounced his legal wife and married
again. " V.V ' ..
After the marriage the couple went to
Petaluma and bought a home, the deed
being in the wife's name. In 1807 they
sold out in Petaluma and taking the
money from this sale purchased the prop
erty of which the estate; now consists, tak
ing the deeds in the old gentleman's
name. Although this property has not
greatly increased in value during the past
twenty years it afforded a living income to
its owners, and if the first wife succeeds in
obtaining possession "Granny Batch will
be lett destitute.
The old couple were well known to every
man, woman and child in Guerneville,
and the news that "Granny" was not the
old man's legal wife created a profound
sensation in this quiet village in the
redwoods. v!
WERE >EVER MARRIED.
Attorney Bachelder Says ''Granny Can
not Claim the Estate.
T. F. Bachelder, a brother of the late
Joseph E. Bacnelder, whose estate is a
bone of contention between two women
who claim to be his widows, says the
woman with whom Joseph Bachelder
lived for over thirty years was not his
wife. He was seen at his home, 1013 Rail
road avenue, Alameda, last night, and
gave this account of the relationship:
â  < "My brother, Joseph Eaton Bachelder,
was born in Wisconsin. In 1851 he was
married to Miss Susan A. Steei, and to the
couple two children were bornâ a boy and
girl. The boy is dead, but the girl grew
into womanhood and married a Mr.
Wheeler of Chicago. One of their chil
dren is now married to a promising Chica
foan. In 1864 a party started from the
East to come to California by wagon-train.
It included my family and myself, my
"brother and other relatives. Joseph's
wife did not come with him.
"We arrived in San Francisco in 1865
< after a six months' trip and dispersed. I
settled down to practice law in the
metropolis, and lave remained here ever
since. My brother first went down into
the Santa Clara Valley, and after staying
there for about three years, went* to G'uer
neville, in Sonoma County. There he in
vested his money in lumber and* accumu
lated a snug sumâ about $4000. After a
few years he bought some lots in Guerne
ville and settled down to live with a
woman whom he had met in San Fran
cisco some time previous. The woman
was of French nationality, and her name
was Mary Louise Larseneur. Joseph was
never married to her, although they lived
together for thirty years. None of the in
habitants of Guerneville was aware of their
clandestine relations and they were held in
high esteem by all.
"It was not until 1887 that Joseph's law
ful wife came to California. She knew of
. his relations with the French woman all
of the thirty years that he had been absent
from her and had tried often to have him
"i leave her. Joseph was, however, afraid of
| the woman and dared not show any indi
cations of waning faith. - .
_ "When Mrs. Bachelder arrived here the
first time she stayed about a year. She
visited Guerneville at that time, meeting
her husband but onceâ at a hotel there.
She was accompanied by her granddaugh
ter, Mrs. Luella Grossette, and both tried
to induce the faithless man to go with
them, but he said that he was in fear of
his life aud dared not. Wife and grand
daughter went away disappointed and re
turned to Chicago. They and myself were
the only persons in California who knew of
the scandalous condition of affairs.
"Nothing of importance happened from
that time until the time of mv brother's
death on the first day of this month. He
died leavine no will and an estate valued
at about $4000 or $5000. I, as attorney for
his lawful wife, applied for letters of pro
bate, and in that capacity found myself at
Santa Rosa last Saturday. While in the
court there I learned that there were two
widows claiming the estateâ the one I rep
resented, and the other the woman with
whom Joseph had been living. The latter
. signed her name 'Mrs. Bachelder.' 1 was
quite surprised, but finally managed to
produce evidence which made a clear case
for my client, and the estate will be con
trolled by the real and only Mrs. Bach
elder. My brother did not fail to provide
tor the putative widow, for before he died
he deeded her two or three houses in
Guerneville. She is now about 70 years of
age.and he was 71."
CALL BAKER TO ACCOUNT
New York Bankers Make
Serious Charges Against

CHICAGO, 111., March 31.â Henry
Clews and Charles M. Foster, late co-part
ners in the New York banking-house of
Henry Clews & Co., filed a bill in the
Federal Court to-day against William T.
Baker, president of the Board of Trade
and the Civic Federation, making serious
allegations regarding the probity of Mr.
Baker.
The bankers accuse him of being re
creant to bis obligations as a trusted
agent :in 1884, when the charter of
the old First National Bank of this
city expired and a new corporation
retained the old name, paying many of
the old stockholders two shares in ex
change for one share of old bans stock,
which it is declared in the bill was then
worth $400 a share.
It is alleged that the New Yorkers, who
owned fifty shares of the old bank stock,
were induced by.the false representations
of their agent, Baker, to accept for their
stock $294 12 : a share, when it was worth
$20,000. .The, court is asked to order a
transfer of stock for the payment of divi

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 31.â The
â  Peffer resolution for an investigation into
all the facts and circumstances of recent
bond issues was not reached in the Senate
to-day, as had been expected, George of
Mississippi having occupied nearly the
entire session in an argument against the
claim of Dupont to the vacant seat in the
Senate from the State of Delaware. Peffer
gave notice, however, that he would at the
close of George's speech to-morrow ask the
Senate to proceed with the consideration
of his resolution. fU^H-^"
About half an hour was given to the
consideration of the postoffice appropria
tion bill, which appropriates more. than
$93,000,000, of which nearly $13,000,000 goes
to defray the expenses of the free delivery
system.. The discussion was started on an
amendment reported from the Appropria
tions Committee allowing $80,000 a year in
addition to the present compensation of
$50,000 to the Oceanic Steamship Company
for mail transportation from. San Fran
cisco to New Zealand and New South
Wales. â¢ â¢ .
There was no morning business of any
consequence to-day, so that within twenty
minutes after the hour of meeting the
Dupont election case was taken up and
George (D.) of Mississippi addressed the
Senate in opposition to the claim of
Dupont as Senator-elect from the State of
Delaware. George spoke for four hours.
His speech, which was not finished when
he stopped, was a constitutional legal ar
gument to prove that Watson, while act
ing as Governor of Delaware, was at the
same time a State Senator and Speaker of
the Senate, and was, therefore, entitled
to vote in the balloting for United States
Senator, consequently that, as Dupont did
not receive a majority of all the votes
cast, he was not duly elected Senator.
Peffer (Pop.) of Kansas gave notice that
he would ask the Senate at the close of
George's remarks to take up his resolution
for an investigation of recent bond issues.
The r>ostolhee appropriation bill was
then taken up. The several amendments
reported by the Appropriations Committee
were agreed to â the one appropriating
$12,818,580 for the "free-delivery system," ,
having added to it the proviso that no part |
of. the sum should be used for payment of
postoffice inspectors. The amendment
allowing $80,000 additional compensation
to the Oceanic Steamship Company for
mail transportation from San Francisco to
New Zealand and New South Wales hav
ing been reached, an inquiry was made by
Vilas (D.) of Wisconsin as to the grounds
on which the amendment was reported.
Allison (R.) of lowa, chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, made an ex
planation. The compensation now pre
sented for that service, he said, was not :
one-third of the subsidy paid to the com
peting lineâ the Canadian line sailing
from Victoria. And it went without say
ing that the American line could not
compete with the Canadian line unless
some subsidy or other allowance was
given to it.
Perkins (R.) of California advocated the
amendment, and said it was a shame and
a reflection on American patriotism to sit
idly by and permit Britishers to come in
and take the Australian trade away from
Americans. Cj~'--}\ -w.~- â "â¢"â¢, ;*.

SUNDRY CIVIL BILL CONSIDERED
An Attempt to Increase the Salary of

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 31.â
monotony of routine consideration of the
sundry civil appropriation bill in com
mittee of the whole in the House to-day
was enlivened by several references to
some politico-financial events of recent
date. Adams (Rep.) "of Pennsylvania
called attention to the reports that repre
sentatives of the Manufacturers' Club of
Philadelphia, in conference with certain
persons in Washington, had committed
the club to the free coinage of silver in
connection with a protective tariff as a
satisfactory platform for the Republican
party. He sent to the clerk's desk and
had read the resolutions adopted last night
by the club as refuting the reports.
In the course of the consideration of the
sundry civil bill attempts were made to
amend it to increase the appropria
tion for the salary of the superin
tendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey
from $5000 to $6000, . the amount fixed by
law ; to strike out the appropriation of
$50,000 for detention and punishing viola
tors of the internal revenue laws, and to
strike out the appropriation of $69,500 for
food, fuel and clothing for the Indians on

The House passed the Senate joint reso
lutions directing the Secretary of War to
prepare estimates for deepening the chan
nel into Portland (Me.) harbor to thirty
feet; to secure a twenty-five foot deep
channel, 400 feet wide, in Providence
River and Narragansett Bay from Sassa
fras Point to the ocean, and to expend
$20,000 for walls to the canal locks at the
Cascades, Columbia River. Or. .V."^
Bingham (R.) of Pennsylvania reported
back the legislative, executive and judicial
bill, with a recommendation that the Sen
ate amendments be disagreed to, and that
a conference be asked. i Agreed to and a
conference committee was appointed.
The House then, in committee of the
whole, proceeded to further consider the
sundry civil appropriation bill.
Adams (R.) of Pennsylvania took occa
sion to refer to the reports which had been,
published respecting the conferences of*
represents. of the chief Manufactur
ers' Club of Philadelphia and of the silver
party in Congress, which he characterized;
as misleading and incorrect. These re
ports conveyed the impression that the
great manufacturing and mercantile ; in
terests of Philadelphia as represented by
the Manufacturers' Club were in favor of
free coinage of silver and had agreed to
yoke that issue with tbe principle of pro
tection. These resolutions, adopted by a
nearly unanimous vote, contained no sup
port of the theory that the club was in
favor of the free coinage of silver. *
Hartman (It.) of Montana explained
that published reports of that conference
had misrepresented the facts.
Allen (R.) of Utah, who was present at
the conference, stated that no bargain had
been made, as reported, and that those
who were concerned in the conference
were not responsible for the errors.
Later Pickler (R.) of South Dakota, in
the same line, brought the action of the
recent Republican State convention in
South Dakota to the attention of the con
vention.
"As to protection, as to finance and as to
every other . doctrine of the Republican
party." said Pickler, "we refer for a de
scription of our attitude to the Minneapo
lis platform until the St. Louis convention
shall give us another." [Applause.]
A somewhat acrimonious; colloquy oc
curred between C. W. Stone (R.) of Penn
sylvania and Cannon (R.) of Illinois, in
charge of the bill, over a' proposition by
the former to increase the ; appropriation
for the salary of Superintendent of the
Coast and Geodetic Survey (General Duf
field) from $5000 to $6000, as provided in
the statute establishing tbe office.
;â â ; The amendment was rejected. The
usual amendment to strike out of the bill
the provision for detecting and bringing
to trial and punishment persons guilty of
violation of 'internal revenue laws and
authorizing the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue to pay for the arrest and detec
tion of such violators, was made by Linney
(R.) of North Carolina.
: Tate (D.) of Georgia moved to strike out
the words "including payments for infor
mation and detection of such violations."
Evans (R.) of Kentucky, a former Com
missioner of Internal Revenue, antago
nized the amendments, saying the pro
vision was the most important in the bill.
He was followed by Say (D.) of Texas
in the same strain. Â/
Linney (R.) of North . Carolina advo
cated the amendment.;. He said that! no
similar amount of money was ever the
cause of so much, corruption '; as this ap
propriation of $50,000. r. Opinion denounced
the spy system which tne appropriation
fostered; it was against public policy and
ought not to be continued. : Swanson (D.)
of Virginia advocated the amendment, as
did Skinner (Pop.) of North Carolina- and
McCall (R.) of Tennessee. \
"Lay ton (D.) of ;'â¢. Ohio, ' opposing .the

IVES DEFEATS GAJtXIER*
Wonderful Work of the Young Xapoleon
of Billiards. Â£sÂ£
, NEW YORK, N. V., March 31.â Frank
C. Ives, the youne Napoleon of billiards,
easily defeated Albert Gamier of Paris, the
Belgian champion, in tbe second game of
the New York ; series of ; the Ives-Garnier-
Schaefer ; 18-inch balk-line tour.iameut ' at
Madison-square Garden to-night. :
Although Gamier showed, better form
than in his game with Schaefer last night
he was completely outclassed. Ives
.played in wonderful form and his manipu
lation of the ivory spheres aroused the
enthusiasm of the large audience. I 'es'
highest run of 200 is the public record in
the new came in which the 18-inch balk
line is used to vary the monotony of the
long runs which were common in "balk
line nursing."; Schaefer exceeded this run
in practice by a run of 290. :
; In the fifth Ives gave an exhibition of
bis true form and wonderful skill. , The
difficult widened rail "nursing" and
wonderful juggling with the "anchor shot"
which Ives displayed roused the house to
enthusiasm. Shot after shot was piled up
with marvelous rapidity and accuracy.
No matter how badly - the ivories broke
Ives' cue brought them back to his com
mand. He added 200 to his score before
he missed a difficult cushion shot. Gam
ier made a desperate struggle to regain
his stroke in the thirteenth.
He piled up 30 by open play all over the
table. Then he got them in position for a
"nurse" along the upper rail but broke
down, making 36 in all. In the last half
of this inning, with the score 527 to 178,
Ives chalked his cue, and with the globes
in good position, rattled off the game with
ease. To-morrow night Schaefer and Ives
will play.
Thesjore: Ives 600, Gamier 178. Aver

O'Brien, who signs himself light-weight
champion of Southern California, issued
a challenge to-day to box any light
weight in. Southern California, "Jack"
Fogarty preferred, fifteen rounds or more
at 130 pounds, give or take two pounds,
for $250 a side, before any reliable club that

is a husky lad, and it is surmised that he
would give Fogarty a good battle. The
latter has the advantage in " height and*
reach and perhaDS excels in science, but
O'Brien is stronger and a better in-fichter.
Fogarty has not yet signified his desire to
accept. There is little show for a match
here, for no club could be induced to hang
up a purse at this time.

FOR ENGLAND AND WALES
Introduction of an Educational
Bill in r the House of
Commons.
Voluntary Schools to Be Maintained
by Grants Extended by the
V Authorities.
LONDON, Eng., March 31. âIn the
House of Commons to-day Sir John E.
Gorst, vice-president of the Committee of
Council, introduced an educational bill
which applies to England and Wales. The
bill proposes to establish an educational
department in every county and borough,
to he controlled by the county councils,
these departments to administer the Par
liamentary grants.
Voluntary schools under this act will be
maintained by grants extended by the
educational authorities, who are empow
ered to make grants to necessitous schools
and also to expend money on scholarships
and for the improvement of thej sanitary
condition of the school building. Volun
tary schools are exempted from the pay
ment of rates. The age up to which chil
dren are required to attend school is fixed
at 12 years. The bill contains a conscience
clause which provides that if a reasonable
number of parents require that separate
religious instruction be given to their
children, the managers of the school upon
which the demand is made shall allow
such instruction. Further assistance is
also given to schools under the direction of
the School Board of Managers.
A. H. D. Acland (Liberal) pointed
out that the bill would involve an enor
mous addition to the educational grants,
probably > Â£500,000. The bill, he said, em
bodied a plan of decentralization largely
abrogating the influence and authority of
the state. It was, he declared, the final
extinction of the principle that local
grants should supplement state aid.
The bill was read for the first time.

I Bitter Complaint Against the
Germans for Exporting
Sugar.
ENCOURAGED BY BOUNTY
Competition That Causes a Big
Protest From American
Producers.
AID ASKED FROM CONGRESS.
Planters "Entitled to Protection in One
of the Greatest Industries
of the Nation.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 31.-The
Ways and Means Committee to-day heard
arguments regarding German sugar.
J. D. Hill of New Orleans said that since
the loss of ; the production from Cuba we
had been forced to go to Germany lor
sugar. Germany ' paid a heavy export
bounty on sugar, and the result was that
the Germans were fast getting control of
the American market, and if conditions
did not soon change and the Cubans be
allowed to make a sugar crop we would be
absolutely at the mercy of the Germans.
To avoid this he urged the passage of a
bill placing an additional duty on German
sugar equal to the amount of export paid.
D. D. Colcock, secretary and superin
tendent of the Louisiana Suear and Spice
Exchange, referred to the bounties allowed
to German exporters, and said that a bill
was now pending in the Reichstag to in
crease the amount of these bounties. Con
gress should take immediate action. As
to the damage we shall sustain there can
be no sort of doubt. Our supply from
Cuba this year is and must continue to be
insignificant. We must therefore turn to
Europe for our necessary sugar stock.
If we go there for 100,000 tons per month
we will have to import thence 500,000 be
fore Congress meets in December. Now,
by virtue of the increased Dounty on that
weieht of sugar, our treasury will lose
14.100 cent per pound or $1,568,000. Our
producers will lose 49-100 cent per pound on
some 770.000,000 pounds, or say $3,772,000,
a loss to the country of $5,341,000.
T. R. Cutler of Lehi, Utah, representing
the beet-sugar producers, said that the
Germans were gaining an unfair advantage
by reason of bounties. It was neither
"free nor fair" trade, and in his opinion
the industry and capital of our country
were entitled to protection against it as
much as they were against the guns of a
foreign nation. Germany was taking ad
vantage of the Cuban war to crush our
sugar industry and he appealed to the
committee to recommend an additional
duty on German sugar.

Empire State Republicans Have Been
* .. Modest and Self-Sacrificing
\ in the Past.
: NEW YORK, N. V.. March 31.â T. C.
*Platt, Cnauncey M. Depew, Warner Mil
ler, Edward Lauterbach and C. W. Hack
ett, chairman of the New York State Re
publican Committee, contribute to the
April number of the North American Re
view, to be published to-morrow, a
symposium on Governor Morton as a
Presidential candidate, in the course of
which they set forth the Governor's claim
upon the Republican party for a coniina
tion to thÂ» presidency.
Mr. Piatt utters a warning against the
confidence felt by many Republicans that
the nominee at the St. Louis convention,
whoever he may be, will te elected.
"It is not safe for the Republicans," he
says, "to assume that they are going to
have a walkover at the Presidential elec
tion in November. Manifold as the blun
ders of the Democratic party have been,
combined with the imbecility and incom
petency of the present administration,
they wiD not prevent the Democracy from
making a hard struggle to retain control
of the Government, and they will not keep
the mass of the Democratic voters from
going to the polls next November and vot
ing their ticket straight. It is, unfor
tunately, a confirmed habit with Democrats
to support their party, right or wrong." ..'
In response to the objections urged by
some to Governor Morton on the score of
his age, Mr. Piatt points to the fact that :
the gf eat statesmen of Europe are mostly '
old men, and he expresses confident assur
ance that, after careful and deliberate con-,
sideration of the situation, the St. Louis
convention will give its decision in favor
of Governor Morton. -.'â !â¢'â 
Mr. Depew, in the course of his paper,
points o to the Venezuelan question -as
demonstrating the value in the Presiden
tial office of diplomacy.
"Governor Morton,'' he say?, "while,
maintaining the rights of America and
strongly and intelligently enforcing her im
penetrable position upon the Monroe doc
trine, would have done it in a message so
clearly and decisively as to raise no ques- |
tion or argument upon tne language of his
?*psr v, 4_\_ -- a -
t*iat doctrine, and at the same time leave
"the ultimate question of war where the
constitution places it, among the represen
tatives of the people."
Mr. Depew says the Governor's influence
upon legislation has been so conspicuous
for reform and good government as to
command, even while he is a candidate for
the Presidency, approval by the press of
..all partes. Mr. Depew urges that the
United States needs a business adminis
tration. "In the election of Mr. Morton
the country would enter upon a long
period of development and prosperity and
would know once more an era of universal
employment and good wages and that
general happiness which comes from the
increase and distribution of National
wealth."
Warner Miller regards Governor Mor
ton's record as a public officer as a. sure
guarantee tbat in his hands all of the-in
terests in the country may be securely
placed and will be absolutely safe. "He is
known to be a thorough protectionist and
a sound money man of the strongest char
acter. Ii he is nominated and elected
President there will no longer be any
doubts in the minds of our people or in
any foreign country as to what our
financial policies will be, and our securities
everywhere will be taken without hesita
tion and without fear that they would be
paid in money other than the best money
of the world. Our credit will be restored
to tne condition it was in when General
Harrison turned the Government ever to
the Democrats. At that time we ; were
able to borrow money at 2}4 per cent."
Mr. Lauterbach lays special emphasis
on the claims of New York State on the
Republican party. He says:
"The Republicans of the Empire State
have been modest and self-sacrificwg.
To them since the creation of the party
has not been accorded the privilege of the
selection of the nominee for this proudest
office in the gift of any people. The des
tinies of the party and fortunes of the
country have uniformly depended upon
its political attitude. Doing much, giving
mucfi, sacrificing â  much, it has hitherto
been accorded scant consideration by the
Republicans of other States.
'It seems but simple justice to acqui-
I esce in its unanimous' suggestion for the
* elevation of it favorits son to the post
which it coye 1 â¢ for him as the crowning
i and deserved glory of a private and public
.'life of singular merit and . desert. His
j nomination, and the / election wfcich ;of
i course would^ertair^y follow^ if^whald se
â  cure the eertai. noueniy of that ptrpet
â  ual 'Republicanism of^h"e State: ;.at of the
real stalwart, v uhfalfermg";Repubncanism
of this great metropolis.
â â '. "Its citizens, by a vast majority, would
respond to the compliment of the nomi
nation of their fellow-citizen by affiliation
with the party whose courtesies to him he
has repaid by an; unswerving devotion to
its principles and purposes. ,'
Mr. Hackettlaays Governor Morton "is
an advocate of the strictest economy in
public expenditi res. His untiring effort
to prevent unnecessary appropriations by.
the State Legislature is most convincing
proof of his attention to the needs of : the
taxpayers.

tion was called to order this morning.

CRISP AM) SMITH TALK.
Debate Between the Secretary and the
Speaker.
AUGUSTA, Ga., March 31.â The debate
between Secretary Hoke Smith and ex-
Speaker Crisp took place to-night in the
Grand Opera-house .before a distinguished
audience. â¢. 'On -the stage were prominent
Georgians', 'and- - Carolina ns,-' headed by
Governor Atkinson, ex- Senator Patrick
Walsh. Mayor Young and -others. Chair
man Doughty of the Richmond County
executive committee stated; the terms. of
the debate and introduced Mr. Crisp..
â¢As Mr Crisp arose; he was greeted by a.
storm of applause He began. by saving
this was a somewhat. unusual spectacle for
Georgia. 4 *Bu't unusual conditions ".exist
and we hope that these conditions will jus
tify the spectacle that is presented. Mr.
Smith and myself are both- Democrats arid
both expect, to stand loyally by the^Demo
cratic National platform ftnd nominees.
But. we differ on the subject of money. . .
"To begin with, you must know money
is a medium of exchange and a measure of
value and the measure -of .deferred pay-.
ments. Price is determined, other things
-being, equal, by the amount of primary
money in the. world. .- Value is determined
by the law. of .supply and demand. This
is a general. law and applies to money as
well as commodities. When we became a
Nation we had to establish our money
standards Each country had to do this
for itself.
: ' ''There, is no such thin? as international
money.-' â¢ This, country cannot decree that
its money shall be legal tender in Eng
land, and England cannot make its money
a legal, tender.-, here.. Any law that
diminishes the amount of standard money
in the world.- is injurious to the masses of
the people; arid, only benefits those who
have fixed incomes ''
Mr,. Crisp closed with an argument to
show that, this country could maintain
free and unlimited coinage of silver inde
pendently of other nations. He was given
J protracted: applause, as he took his seat.
Chairman Doughty immediately intro
â¢ Muc'e-w^ecV^nrSialth and he had to pause
J ' until the applause 'ended which greeted
him. He then said : .'
"We are here to-night consulting to
gether as Democrats upon party policy.
In opposing .the. free coinage of silver I
am not fighting .silver and don't seek to
reduce its use its legal tender value. I
favor . all the gold;; silver, and paper that
can be kept equally good."
In answer to the charge, that. they were
seeding to stop the use of silver or to con
tract the currency he gave the amount of
gold and sliver - ; in -circulation-. in .1560, in
1873 and in 1895, showing that. the total to
day is eight times that of "â  IS?3. â¢ "We are
not. trying 'to contract the currency, and
our silver friends mislead you if they make
you believe, we. do not mean to accomplish
the use of, 'both- gold and. silver., as the
money of ' final payment for all obligations
of this conn t.ry." = [Applause. 1 ;â â 
Jefferson, he said, found gold worth fif
teen times. as much as silver and fixed the.
rate at 15 to 1- Our latter-day statesmen
find gold worth thirty times as much as
silver, but want to fix the ratio at only 16
to L
It was 11:30 o'clock before the debate
ended.
ST. JOHX IS THEIR CHOICE.
Chairman Dickey Talks of the Prospects
of Prohibitionists .
NEW YORK, N. V., March Samuel
Dickey of Albion, Mich., chairman of the
National Prohibition party, who is in the
city, was seen yesterday and asked re
garding the convention to be held in Pitts
burg May 27. The split in the party,
owing to the public declaration of ex-
Governor St, John in favor of free silver and
a union of force with the Populists, with
prohibition as a subordinate plank, is, he
declares, the most serious complication
that Prohibitionists have ever had to meet.
"My judgment is," said Chairman
Dickey, "that so long as thiere is ..only one
party in the field that declares for prohi
bition, . : ex-Governor St. "John' may be re
lied upon to stand with that party, though
he is thoroughly in sympathy with free
silver. In- the last convention in, Cincin

STOCKTON, Cat,., March 3Lâ Chief of
Police Kingsbury and Deputy Constable
Sullivan brought two very crestfallen
prisoners to the county jail shortly before
noon to-day. They were Charles Paulson

picked up on the roadside near French

woman, but she was. not familiar with the
ways of the. world and :fell ah. easy victim. ,
to Paulson's blandishments. ... â¢' .-: .' _'â â¢- â¢ â¢-'
The husband. started upon the trail" of
the eloping couple, not so much intent,
upon revenge as he was upon rescuing his.
wife. . Last week he came to Stockton and
solicited the aid : the local officers. Good,
luck, favored. Deputy Constable Sullican
and he met the runaways on the French
Camp road . to-day. The ' husband -had
sworn out a warrant -in San Luis. Obispo 1 :
County before he left,- in order that the [
officers in other localities would have ho j
trouble in arresting and holding the two â¢â¢
should they find them.
Paulson has spent most of his life in the
traveling show business. He is a heavy,
set, light-compleiioned man, dresses well
and has a fluent tongue. When asked
what he was doing with the woman, he
replied that he was merely driving
through the country for her heal and;
added: "I guess 1 have as good a right to
haul passengers and freight as the South
ern Pacific.
Constable Sullivan and Chief Kingsbury
heard that the couple were in the vicinity
of French Camp early in the morning, and
both started out in search of them, taking
different roads. Where the county and
toll roads meet the officers separated in
order to mate a more careful search. Sul
livan came upon the runaways first. They
were in a covered wagon with the curtains
tightly drawn, and it was some time before
the man responded. to Sullivan's calls. : '
The constable talked against time in or

up. As the chief did not arrive soon

der arrest started in to help him hitch
up the team in Order to come to the city.
Kingsbury goon showed up and took the
man in charge and : .Constable Sullivan
brought the woman to town in his buggy.
The officers do not know who the team
driven by Paulson belongs to, and in fact
do not know just upon what charge the
San Luis Obispo warrant was issued.
At the jail Paulson took /matters very
coolly. and declined to talK much. The
woman does not seem to realize her dis
graceful position or have any regrets over
the desertion of her husband and children.
- The husband and San Luis Obispo offi
cers were notified by telegraph, and it is
expected that they will arrive here to

WOODLAND, Cal., March 31.â Charles

stolen from a drugstore, and he swallowed
a portion of it in, the presence of County

When questioned by Mr. Chamberlain
as to what the drug was and why he took
it Shafer answered that he had a bad cold
and was using quinine. Rut the contrac

the quinine story and Mr. Chamberlain
lost no time in securing the services of a

the sum total of all, the votes cast. This
will doubtless give the Gilroy candidate a
standing near the head of the list. The

Wood, a* prominent citizen of Lincoln

Wood with reference to Rev. Mr. John
son's remarks about the girls of Fresno: 1^ \
. "No doubt he alluded to the deplorable
fact that many girls are early ruined in.
California, as well as elsewhere, and it is
possible bis remarks were indiscreet or ex
aggerated ; but does that justify the rough ,
element of Fresno in its extravagant and
fiery indignation? Rev. I. F. Johnson is â¢
well known all over New England, and has
labored with approval and decided success
in more than a half hundred of our
churches, many of them the largest in the
towns and cities of the East. Â« â¢ â¢:
"Thousands of useful and active mem
bers in our societies have been led to
Christian lives in his meetings. 1 hardly
know a man of his age .who has been in

young people to Christ. This Fresno
bluster will .make no impression upon
thousands who have known him for many
years. Quite a number of the ministers
of the Southern California conference and
not a few people living in Pasadena and
Los Angeles know the troth of these state
ments.
"If our Governor said what he is re
ported ito; have said he has exhibited a
pitiable weakness. Ministers of the gospel
are under the same restrictive laws and
liable to the same tines and penalties for
wrong sayings and wrong; doings that
Governors, editors and politicians are, and
they do not need, as he suggests, some

MITCHELL FIRE-SWEPT.
Lower Portion of the Oregon Town Almost
Entirely Destroyedâ Few Losers
Are Insured.
PORTLAND. Or., March 31.â The lower
part of the town of Mitchell, in Crook
County, was almost entirely destroyed by
fire Friday afternoon. ; The fire originated
in Misener's new block, occupied by W. L.
Palmer and J. F. Magee. It is not known
how the tire started, Palmer's family being
absent at the time. When the flames were
first discovered they were bursting through
the roof and sides of the building, and
soon the whole structure was ablaze. The
front part was occupied by J. F. Magee as
a grocery- and the upper part by the
Knights"of Pythias and the A. O. U. W.
The flames soon connected with adjoining
buildings, and as a strong wind was blow
ing up the canyon there was no hope of
saving them. It was only by the most
strenuous efforts that the fire was pre
vented from reaching the upper portion of
the town.
The following is believed to be the only
Insurance: B. T. Brennan, $500; R. E.
Misener, $2800, and J. F. Magee, $500. The
buildings burned were the Misener block,
the old Mitchell Hotel adjoining on the
! west, three residences owned by R. E.
j Misener and occupied by S. F. Allen, R. E.
j Misener and N. S. Misener; A. C. McEach

PROTEST OF THE ANGELENOS.
Chamber of Commerce to Be Heard in
Favor of an Open Harbor at
San Pedro.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 31.â The
agitation of the local harbor question,
which has been so stirred up by recent re
ports from Washington ar.ent a double
appropriationâ one for San Pedro and one
for Santa Monica, whereas an appropri
ation for San Pedro only was asked and
expected by the community at large â is
at fever heat. There is great apprehen
sion lest the opposition to the proposed .
appropriation for Santa Monica will re
sult in the defeat of both. ). V-v
â  The preponderance of sentiment appears
to be opposed to an appropriation for
Santa Monica at this time, for the reason
that the $100,000 to begin work on an outer
harbor there means the committal of the
Government to the construction of a deep
sea harbor at that point, contrary to the
reports of all the boards of Government
engineers and the wish of the people of
Southern California generally.
It is argued that the Government will
; never undertake the construction of two
deep-sea harbors less than thirty miles
apart, and as the appropriation proposed
for Wilmington or San' Pedro by this Con
gress' is for the improvement of the inner
harbor only, it can expect nothing of fu
ture Congresses if the Government is once
committed to the expenditure .of a large
sum: of 'money at Santa Monica for the
â  same purpose. :.-?â *'..
It is admitted that Huntington played
his trump card when he succeeded in get
ting an appropriation for Santa Monica in
corparted in the river and harbor bill, in
the face of such strenuous opposition.
The committee sent to Washington by
the Free Harbor League to lobby for San
Pedro is greatly exercised over the turn
affairs have taken. Member^ of the com
mittee and others are expending every
effort to head off the appropriation for
Santa Monica.
The committee on commerce of the
Chamber of Commerce held a meeting this
afternoon to draft resolutions to be pre
sented at the meeting of the board of
directors of the Chamber of Commerce to
morrow afternoon. These resolutions, it
is understood, are more, emphatic, if pos
sible, than those adopted by the Free
Harbor League in favor of San Pedro last
Saturday. As Santa Monica has some
warm friends in the ' board of directors, a
red-hot fight is expected when the resolu
tions are called up. -'v %'';:.^'

Consumption is a disease caused by

to be done in its treatment is to make j
the blood pure, rich and wholesome.
That is half the battle. The other, half
.is â¢ the impregnation of the blood with
cleansing, healing, invigorating medi-
cines. The "Golden Medical Discov-
ery " does both. . It . first puts the whole
digestive system into perfect order, rids
it of all impurities and from the vantage

from a set of common causes. ? The same
disorder may lead to different symptoms

a little indigestion in one' person, may

carrying out, and a great and harmonious
spectacular production is thus assured.
"The opening ceremony, Tuesday, April

contemplates an attack on the city, in the
name of the Queen, the storming of the
City Hall, capture of the Mayor and city
officials, and the creation of a fiesta re
gime. After the capture of the city au

chance to protest will rbe handcuffed ana

for this especial purpose. r
. When the attack is made on the city it
has been arranged to j have all the steam
whistles in the city announce the event by
a series of shrill blasts, and' these will be
i punctuated by the ringing of bells and
beating of d urns, It is expected to pro- ;
; duce a result, which will fnllv impress

MUCH GOLD IS MISSING

Loss Suffered by Two Californians
While Visiting at the National
Capital.
WASHINGTON. D. C, March 31.âSam
uel Hamilton,' a lawyer from Los Angeles,
and William Davis, a merchant from San
Francisco, arrived at the Ebbitt House at
a late hour on the night of November 25
last. A day or so afterward they received
a bag of gold and deposited it in the hotel
' safe. In a few days they departed from
the hotel and took rooms elsewhere. r For
safety they left the bag of gold at the
Eobitt House.
About the Ist of January Davis had one
â  of the clerks open the bag and began using
j from it and drew out at intervals sums
; amounting to $000. .
Davis and Hamilton went to the hotel to
; get the bag and take it away with them.
j Upon receiving it, they at once declared
I that it felt very light. The amount was
j counted and the two men said that < $620
had disappeared. They are positive that
! when the bag was shipped from San Fran-
I Cisco it contained $1750 in goldâ all except
j $10 in 20 cold pieces. â¢ : . .;
They have demanded, reparation at the
hands of the hotel* management, but it is
I not likely they will get it. Manager Burch
j is inclined to â¢ treat the affair lightly, and
' declares that the money could -lot have
j been stolen while in custody of himself or
j his clerks. The money in the bag betpnged
j to Davis, who says that he recently retired
; from the commission and liquor business
, in San Francisco. Hamilton says:
'â  â¢ "We left San Francisco about the 20th
1 of November and came direct to Washing- 1
ton on private business concerning Mr.
Davis. Before we started I had $2000 in
gold belonging to him, and ' we went all
over San Francisco trying to get green- i
| backs but failed. ;So we shipped the
; money by the Wells - Fargo and the Ad
-1 ams Express -'.to, Washington. After ar
i riving at the Ebbitt House we went to the
express office to get the money. Congress
man Newlands of Nevada identified us. i
"The bag of money was carried to the
hotel and placed unopened in. the. safe,
where \ it remained until December 12. '
That day we went to New York and as we
thought we niijrht %go West from there we
j took out the bag 'of gold and carried it to
, New York with us. We did not unseal it.
. .however, arid Mr. Davis, at my suggestion,
, bought a .small hand satchel in which to
carry it. When we came back to Wash- j
ington we put the satchel containing tbe j
* bag in the hotel again. ' *;y
;"."" "About the ; first of the year Mr . Davis â¢
commenced. drawing money from the bag,
and has kept a careful account of the
money taken out, which has been for our
expenses. The satchel was kept locked
and he had the key. When : he wanted '
money the clerk would set the â¢ satchel on
the counter and 1 Davis would ' unlock j it,
reach in and take out a few, shiners.-; Yes
terday we went to the hotel together, and
I sat down to write some letters and Davis
cot the; bag. It. was apparent instantly
that .something, was- wrong and a count
showed ': $620 more i gone ; than Davis â  had
taken." .- , \.

GLEE CLUB IN TROUBLE
Berkeley Collegians : Want the
Organization Under Their
Control.
Opposition to the Measureâ
" Civic Federation Circular.
Interesting News.
'I". BERKELEY, CAif, March There is
much talk among . tbe students of I the
university favoring the idea of. placing the
management of the Glee Club under the
charge of the Associated Students and of
assuming control of all the movements of
the club. This scheme has been in the
minds of many of the most prominent
and influential students for some time
past, and since it has leaked out the
thought of having their freedom and their
established ; privileges taken away : from
them has been rankling in the breasts of
the club members. â¢/ :
.The promoters of the new plan claim
that the Glee Club, under its present or
ganization, . is: not in * sufficiently close
touch with the student body, but is a sort
of organization conducted for the : good
of the few under the colors of the blue and
the gold. They say further that tne clubs
of nearly all the other colleges; of import
ance in the land have their glee clubs and
kindred club* under the management of
the student Body, and hot an individual or
a small party ot individuals. 'â  ââ¢
' "As it is now," said a prominent mem
ber of '96 to-day,"the U. C. Glee Club can
do wnat it pleases, where it pleases
and come when it pleases under the name
of the university without being held ac
countable' to any one but its own mem
bers. Other organizations of importance
in the university," said he, "come i under
university rule, and I do not see: why the
Glee Club should not. If it does come in
closer touch with the student body per
haps the college men as a whole will get
more good out of it." . .
The members of the club who have been
known to express . their ; views with regard'
to the innovation, : scorn '{ the idea. vehe
mently and declare their own right to run
their own institution i since it - was formed

voice of the entire body. ;
"We : have been i prospering' under our
present condition," said a member, "and'
we ought to be allowed to continue in our
prosperity. Even if we were under the close
rule of the Associated ; Students, I do not
see how the condition could be improved
upon. The students would' not turn out
to the concerts then any better than ; they
do now, and then, on ] the other hand, the
entire body would be responsible for the
debts of tho club, should any accrue; but
as it is now we are responsible ourselves."
. Most of the members are. very reticent
about talking of the proposed change, and
say they put but little confidence in the
rumored â < action of ; the student body, but
the reformers of the college, on the other
ham*, state that the time for the glee club
to be one of the university organizations,
and not an institution for. the benefit of a
few, has nearly come. â  â â 'â â¢â :

incognito ."Civic federation" in the inter

Berkeley some time before ' next Saturday,
the date set for the special school election.
The dodgers will Â£be * similar, in v nature to

unexpected appearance., .. Ten thousand of
them were:; distributed : in ; the* dead sof

next . morning their ' front doorsteps were
covered with the circulars. ~$ The ; ones
which are to be* distributed this week are
already ; - printed,^ and their â¢" existence is
presumably being 'kept as 5 a dead secret.
The "Civic Federation" makes the % same
objections to the' new bond measure that
were advanced ;by it in the course of > the
last special election. ~- . *â ""â -. â 
i The circular is a four-paged leaflet con
taining in addition to the old : points two

I REDWOOD CITY, Cal., March 31.â >
the Potter removal suit an order was
| made by Judge Buck in the Superior
Court to-day ; to â¢ reopen * the cause, that
further consideration may be given to the
question 'of conspiracy between the re
spondent ?in the action,: Jesse Sheldon
â¢Potter, and Henry Miller, the surviving
partner of Charles Lux, deceased.
Judge Buck is now in position to draw
his regular salary to-morrow, as he can
truthfully make affidavit that there is no
action pending "in his court where a de
cision has been withheld for a period
longer than ninety days. , ... i
- > It practically amounts ;to â  putting the
final result off for a further period of about
six months from the present date. While
the first two points have been decided in
Jesse Potter's favor the whole substance
of the trial hinges on the question of con
spiracy, and ito that extent Potter \is still
"on tbe anxious seat." In. the meantime
James Crowe, the special administrator
appointed to act in Potter's place, . will
bold over. The full text of the order is as
follows: _. â <:..''
Â«â ' In the Superior Court, County of San Mateo,
in the matter of the estate of Charles Lux,
deceased: *:-, i, "_Â» '\ â¢' ,- â ;.>'â ';/ "â¢
In the above matter the contestant, Henry
Lux, seeks to remove the respondent, Jesse S.
Potter, as executor of the estate of Charles Lux,
deceased, upon the grounds:
| Firstâ Want of integrity.
Incompetence.
-Third-Conspiracy between respondent and
Henry Miller, the surviving partner of Charles
Lux, deceased. .
Upon consideration the first and second
points or grounds will be decided against con
testant, the reasons to be hereafter given.
Upon the third point the court is somewhat in
doubt. A conspiracy should not be found in
-the ; matter "except upon the most careful in
vestigation. Not being fully satisfied upon
this last ground, and the estate herein be
ing under good management, that of our
Public Administrator, . James Crowe, it is
hereby ordered that this case be and the same
.is hereby reopened for further argument, such
â¢argument to be confined to the third question,
that of conspiracy. Contestant _. to : have

invitation to the city â  officials of Minne

Alameda can give them points that are
worth having. If they consent to come a

Jackson streets. . The flames broke out in
the laundry of Sam Sing, 338 Jackson
street. i>; s?"^
The fire originated in the. rear of the
place among the dingy old Chinese
rookeries of that, locality. It soon swept
around, burning the tailor-shops of Tong

Governor Hughes' Secretary Gets the Set
ter of a Man Who Attacked Him.
"â¢ PHCEXIX, Ariz., March 31.â Political
excitement is at fever heat ! over the re
moval of Governor Hughes and the nomi
nation of B. J.Franklin of Plicenix for the
office. Mr. Franklin has not taken an ac
tive part in the war upon Governor Hughes
and seems as nearly acceptable to all fac
tions of the Arizona Democracy as any one
that could have been named.
The feeling between the friends and
enemies of Governor Hughes continues
very bitter,
,J. D. Boyd, a prominent Democrat, was
denouncing Governor Hughes last night
when Eklridge Jordan, the Governor's
private secretary, resented his words.
Boyd thereupon made an assault upon
Jordan, who struck Boyd across the face
with his cane, breaking the walking-stick,
and inflicting a flesh wound which bled
profusely, rriends separated the combat
ants and the country is safe.
Territorial Secretary H. C. Boone, who
was about to assume the duties of
Governor owing to the removal of
Governor Hughes, suffered a painful acci
dent to-day, which will confine him to his
bed for some time. He was thrown from
his bicycle and the muscles of his right
arm were terribly lacerated and torn from
the bone. Mr. Bone is suffering intense
pain.

A Mining Man Falls Right on;
His Feet in This State. I
Found Some Camps That Did Nov
"Pan Out." \ |
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS IN ThA
world that will stand as landmarks as long?
as the English language is spoken, and not an? '
inconspicuous one is the typical Californiau*^
gold-miner..; He has fewer traits that leave a
disagreeable memory than most of the rugged
types of the world; and he has more of tho
genuine manly spirit than most people who get
lauded for their conspicuous bravery. Accus-
tomed to face hard times as well as "the har-
vest of plenty," he learns, without knowing it
almost, .to sympathize with the "weak and
weary." And when things do not look par-
ticularly roseate with bim he accepts the con- â¢
dition of affairs with a complacency that iÂ«
matchless as well as admirable.' One of the
younger men who to-day are to .be ; found try-
ing to carve out for themselves "name and
fame" in the mines is Mr. A. Burton, who iatt
now in the great gold-bearing section of GrasM
Valley. Mr. Burton isan honest, good-naturedH
fellow. He has had his share of misfortune*
too, and when a few mouths ago he was st rlckeqH
right in the middle of his work with a most*
dangerous disease it seemed as though fate hadM
determined to "down him." But he imrrAH
diately "struck out" for the Hudson Medi^HJ
Institute, the institution which has become^HJ
famous on account of the wonderfully clevcÂ»
work of the specialists practicing there, and asf*
a result he is back at work again, and thank*
ful for what has been done for him. He has
written as follows to the managers : i
GRASS VALLEY, Cal.; Ah?. 18, 1895. Â»
I Hudson Medical Institute, San Francisco. Cal.-' .
| Gentlemen: I. have received three letters from
you which were sent to Doivnieville. I have been
10 Gold Valley and to Nevada and through nearly
all the mining camps ever since, and that was tha
reason that i did no' get my mail before. The
medicine that I took did roe lots of goo 1. and I
shall soon send for some more. "* oura respe.'tc
fully, â¢' .-'*:â¢ A. BURTON.
â So although Mr. Burton has not "struck it
very rich" in the mining camps recently he (
certainly made no mistake when he became
sick as to where to go. But every ono has the
same experience who applies to this. "Mecca
for all the sick for assistance. .. Thousands of
testimonials bear out the absolute truth of thii
assertion. For instance:
F. Minturn, St. Louis, Mo. : "I desire to ex-
press my sincere thanks for the carelul and
conscientious manner in which my case haj
i been treated by you." : i
S. M. Hooker of Los Angeles writes: "I now
i feel as though I am a cured and a well man."
K. C.Taft of Sto we, Cal., says: "lam feeling
! fine without a sign of disease now.
G. H. Bent :' "By the time I get the medicine
! taken that I have now I don't think that I will
j need any more."
It is a satisfactory thing to see all these or-
! pressions of good opinion and good '7ill coming
â¢ in, as they do, by the hundreds daily to the
j physicians of the. great Hudson Institute, af-
i fording further proof that if you are suffering

lOBENGULA WON UNDER WRAPS
Sowena B Downed a Field of Twelve
Speedy Youngsters in the
Pacific Stake.
It appears to be no trick at all for the
sprinters to cover the six furlongs over the
Bay District's fast clayey track in 1:13
coast record time. In fact when Major
Cook defeated Kamsin very cleverly it.
the sixth event yesterday, and stepped the
distance in the record notch, it failed to
aitract more than passing comment. The
Major, carrying 104 pounds, was an even
money chance, and after William Pinker
ton, had reeled off the first half in .47*4
seconds, took command and headed the
game Kamsin out a length at the wire.
There were but three starters.
The fact that a stake event as well as
the usual selling and purse races had to be
decided attracted a much better crowd
tnan on the opening day of the week, and
the betting was much "livelier. Turee of
the seven events run off went to favorites
in the betting.
The Pacific stake for two-year-olds,
worth J**) to the lucky youngster, at four
furlongs, drew out a field of twelve. The
Fl Primero staole entries, Lnmina and
Fleur de Lis, had first call in the betting,
the rim never laying better than 11 to 5
against the pair. Key del Tierra at threes
was the next most fancied, with the Burns
A* Water boose duo. Rowena B and King
Street, third in demand at 4to 1. The lat
ter stable opened in the betting at 2% to 1.
Long odds were obtainable against the I
other starters. The start was. as usual,
good. Kowena B soon headed the field of
gay colors and, clipping along at a merry
rate, passed the wire two lengths clear of
her stable companion, King Street, who in
a drive took tne place from Howard S by
a nose. The distance was covered in 48"*Â£
seconds.
Owner Pat Dunne annexed the purse in |
the opening six-furlong run with San j
Marco. The chestnut colt was backed .
down from 7 to 5 to evens, and having a
most ordinary field to dispose of won eas- j
ily from the second choice, Candor.
In the next event, a seven-furlong affair j
decided under selling conditions, the 8 to j
6 choice. Hermanita, won only after some j
very persuasive riding on the part of Ed
die Jones. Mt Air, the second choice,
sailed out in the lead when the eight
starters were dispatched, and died away to
nothing in the stretch when looking all
over a winner. Pollock, an outsider, then
took up the running and was beaten out
but thiee parts of a length by the favorite.
The Flambeau-Fairy Rose filly. Sweet
Rose, again disappointed her admirers in
the six furlong dash that was third on the
card. Sent to the post an even money
choice, she ran well for half a mile and
then began falling to the rear. . In a hard
drive Piggott got the 2]4 to l second
choice, . Morven, to the wire first, a neck
in front of Crawford. Gold Bug was a
close third. . . " ''
Green Morris cut a watermelon in the
fifth race with Strathflower, against which
the ring laid sto 1. The mare led all the
way, and won ridden out at the end half a
length before , the 100 to 1 shot Seaside,
ridden by Snider.' The 4 to 5 favorite j
Thelma was beaten.out the last jump a ;
nose for the show by Monita.

Babcock'n Annual Report.
Superintendent of Common Schools Babcock
has announced to the teachers of the depart
ment that his annual report is. now ready for
distribution,* and special attention is called to
the report of the committee of fifteen; to the
report of the Commissioner of Education" on
the sanitary condition of the schooihouses; to
Lobeneula, who captured the last race of
the day over a mile and a sixteenth. .--. But
four started, with Yankee Doodle reigning
a hot even I money choice. â  The favorite,
under wraps, with Benham and Logan at
his side heads, apart, raced abreast almost
to the bend for home. Jones on Loben
gula, who had been trailing behind, then
moved up with ',;. his I mount, and ',- easily
taking the lead straightened for the wire,
won under Fa pull," a ' neck in front of
Benham. The winner's time was 1:48, a
fine performance considering the ease with
which it was ae*J>mplished.
â¢â¢â¢'..; Track and Paddock Items.
This will be the closing day of the Cali
fornia â¢ Jockey Club's two weeks' meeting.
Ingleside . track will reopen to-morrow
with a great card and "Ladies' day." as the
special attraction. '
Jockey Heinrichs of Little Pete fame de
parted for St. Louis last evening. Ever
since the exposure* the "St. Louis Garri
son" has been guarded by an employe of
the Morse Patrol Agency, the officials of
the Jockey Club fearing no doubt that the
ruled-off riders or their friends might at
tempt an assault on the ex-friend of the
Chinese plunger.
There was quite a heavy play on Rastus,
who faced the starter for the first time in
the two-year stake. The roan son of Flam
beau, who is a half brother to Tim and Pat
Murphy, was originally named Mike Mur
phy, to denote the relationship probably,
but it did not suit the taste of his esthetic
purchaser at the Palo Alto stock farm sale.
The youngster was slow to get away but
showed a good turn of speed.
Eddie Jones seems to be carrying off the
jockey honors easy. He again rode three'
winners yesterday, including Rowena B,
winner of the stake event.

Another Booming Meeting of the
Growing Howard Republican
Club Last Night.
JJThe Republican County Committee will
meet in Scottish Hall to-morrOw evening,
according to a call issued by Chairman
Manwaring yesterday. ,
At this meeting the matter of the pri
mary election for delegates to the State
Convention will be taken hold of and a date
for the election fixed. The course hereto
fore outlined will be followed, the mem
bers from the Fourth and Fifth Congres
sional districts forming themselves into
separate committees for the official conduct
of tne elections in those districts. The
primary will probably be held within two
weeks.
Republican club meetings throughout
the City are increasing in number. One
of those held last night was the fort
nightly gathering of the Howard Club,
which" has started out with the ambition
and promise of being the banner Republi
can club of the City during the coming
campaign.
The largest hall in Pythian Castle was
packed at the meeting, which was pre
sided over by Frederick Fry. Brief and
snappy speeches were delivered by John
T. Dare, Justice G. C. Groezinger, A. T.
Barnett, W. J. Blattner, Colonel Eddy,
James Field, C. W. Kyle, Fred Eggers,
John W. Koch, F. McGregor, the secre
tary, Thomas F. Graham and others.
The proceedings were further enlivened
and varied by songs rendered by Messrs.
Silver and Wyatt, McCloskey and Mc-
Henry and Webb and Heffernan, who
were accompanied on the piano by Charles
Ward. Waiter Burley's recitations were
another^ feature. Forty new members
were added to the roll.
The club will give its annual picnic at
Schutzen Park on May 10. c

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 1, 1896.
CALLSTHEM CORMORANTS
Attorney John Flournoy Withers
the People's Home Bank
Directors.
NO LONGER BANK COUNSEL.
He Declares the Board Never Votes
for the Interests of the Insti
tution.
John Flournoy has been retired from
the position of attorney : for the People's
Home Savings Bank, the unfortunate in
stitution that has paid but two dividends
in nearly three years, while a ring in con
trol has grown rich out of the manage
ment.
Mr. Flournoy is only too glad to be
done with the ring.
"I quit the employ of the bank," he
wrote yesterday in his letter of resignation,
'â¢without a single regret and with the hope
that whatever calamity may hereafter be
fall me and the 10,000 people whose prop
erty is now under your control no fate will
be so unkind as to ever again bring any of
us in intimate contact with you or with
men of your temper aud character."
The depositors without an exception
were anxious for Flournoy to continue as j
attorney of the bank. He himself did not
wish to retain the position, as he could not
agree with, the directors, who, in fact, re
jected his advice in cases to benefit their
friends against the interests of depositors. l
The directors met yesterday and adopted j
a resolution dispensing with Mr. Flour- !
noy's services, j. Dalziell Brown, secre- j
tary of the Safe Deposit and Trust Com- i
panv, which is trustee for 2600 depositors,
appeared with Attorney Bartnett and pro
tested against the action; and besides
there was a petition from 1600 depositors,
representing in all over $1,000,000, against
the removal of the reputable attorney.
Immediately after the meeting Mr.
Flournoy was notified of the change, and
he replied in this interesting fashion, with
hard dings at the board :
March 31, 1896.
Board of Directors of the People's Home Savings
Gkntlemen : 1 acknowledge receipt of
your communication Informing me that you
have passed a resolution dispensing with my
services. I desire to thank George F. Davidson j
and I. J. Truman for their considerate action j
toward me, and I do not wish anything in this
letter to be in any way construed as a reflec- j
lion upon them, In my judgment they are j
the only present directors who have informed j
themselves of the condition of the affairs of !
the bank and who have any adequate concep- |
Hon of the duties of trustees of a bank in liqui
dation.
Your resolution above referred to is as fol
lows :
"As the litigation here of .the People's Home
Savings Bunk is now in such a condition that
a salaried attorney is not necessary, and the
payment of regulary salary to any attorney
would be an unnecessary burden upon the I
creditors of said bank, and as the cases pend- I
ing outside this City are in the hands of local
attorneys that represent said bank, be it there
fore
Resolved, That from and after this date this
board will dispense with the services of John \
Flournoy, Esq., its attorney, and that no regu
lar attorney snail be employed by this board,
and Mr. Flournoy is hereby directed to deliver
to the secretary of the bank all boot's and pa
pers belonging to the bank now in his pos
session." BHif "iff iprHrBBmIBIIB
I am exceedingly amused at your recently
developed anxiety to remove "unnecessary
burdens from the creditors of the bank." I
trust, however, that very few of the depositors
will be found so simple as to be deceived by
such expressions of high regard for their wel
fare, and that still fewer will be so soothed by

tail was no doubt overlooked during that great
spasm of economy which forced you not only
to forget facts and agreements, but .to empha
size your solicitous concern for the creditors
of the bank by dispensing with j my services in
the middle of the month and leaving my salary
unpaid. >: , ,.vV--.''.â .:y: \.r,: : A-,.-; 'â .-.â¢-.
As the majority now controlling your board
seldom indorse a measure or vote for a resolu
tion in. the interests of the bank I am con
strained to consider my dismissal as the
highest proof which you could offer that I have
economically and faithfully discharged my
duty as attorney for the People's Home Sav
ings Bank.
1 quit the employ of the bank without a sin
gle regret, and with ; the hope that whatever
calamity may hereafter befall me and the 10,
--000 people whose property is now under your
control, no ; fate will be so unkind as to ever
again bring any of us in intimate contact with'
you or with men of your temper and character.
Yours very truly, . John Flournoy.
"For four months they ' have been try
ing to remove me," said Mr. Flournoy,
"but they could not get even in their dis
reputable lot four votes against me. Messrs.
Truman and Davidson have been in the
small minority. Mr. Truman is well
known in San Francisco, and Mr. David
son, a man of fine? mind, is a son of Pro
fessor Davidson. : The others are George
Stone, William A. Phelps, S. K. Thornton,
William P. Taylor and Captain Freeman.
Taylor was elected to-day. It took me
four months to familiarize myself with the
bank's affairs, he learned enough in four
hours to vote on my removal.
"The directors claimed to have acted on
the score of economyâ absolute nonsense;
they never thought of such a thing for a
moment. They claimed there was no ne
cessity for an - attorney, yet : there are 120
suits to be brought against the stock
holders, and: nineteen suits are pending
involving $200,000. This does not include
the ordinary routine of the bank, requiring
advice of counsel daily, nor does it take in
business in Arizona which was done by
local attorneys under my supervision.
The plan is to let the work out to different
attorneys. The institution is managed on
methods of little political clubs, and seems
to be conducted as a semi-political
machine, which is . managed by Stone,
Thornton and Sheehan.

DR. BROWN'S FATE.
It Is, Believed That the Bay. Conference
at Berkeley April 14 Will Expel
Him From the Pulpit.
When the Bay Association and Bay
Conference of the Congregational church
meet at Berkeley April 14 it is confidently
believed that their joint labors will end
Dr. C. O. Brown s career as pastor of the
First Congregational Church. That a
force is slowly gathering against him that
will sweep him away is the expression of
several prominent members.
The committee of five on credentials of
the Berkeley meeting will be in the court
of inquiry. Deacon CalebScudder, Deacon
I. H. Morse and three others not yet
known will compose the committee.
To-night the First Congregational Church
in a body will take up the expulsion and
excommunication of Mrs. Stockton,
charged with trying to extort money from
Dr. Brown. Her pert' letter of resignation
which she wrote to the trustees was
ignored, as the Congregational church
does not receive and consider letters of
resignation from members.

REGENTS CONSIDER SITES.
Tenders of Land ; for the Wil
merding School of
: Trades.
OFFER OF THE LICK TRUST.
Delegations Given Thirty Days to
Amend Pending Proposi
tions.
The Board of Regents of the State Uni
versity, at a special meeting held yester
day at the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art,
to consider l sites for -She Wilmerding
school, listened to delegations represent
ing San Francisco, Alameda and San Joa- :
quin counties. The Regents attending
were Governor* Budd, Hallidie, Martin,
Houghton, Jeter, Wallace, John E. Budd,
Marye, Chase, Reinstein, Phelps, Black,
Lynch, Rodgers, Slack, Foote and Hell
man.' ' ' - â ';.>'- \-
The introduction of the new Regent, the
Governor's brother, John E. Budd, was
brief.
The report of the special committee on
sites for Wilmerding school, which was
submitted at the last : meeting' 'and laid
over, was taken up and read by J. West
Martin. Seventeen offers are enumerated,
which embrace tenders from San Fran
cisco, San Leandro, Redwood City, Berke
ley, Fruitvaie, Oakland, . Lorin, Lakeport
and Stockton.
The report of ; the committee recom
mends the acceptance of the Teraescal site,
and for the purpose of getting the question
properly presented, J.' West Martin moved
the adoption of the report.
Alfred Bouvier then addressed the board,
advocating the selection of > a site in San
Francisco. He spoke as a representative
of the State Development Committee.
James D. Phelan read a memorial from
a joint committee of I the Merchants' Asso
ciation, Chamber of Commerce, Mechanics'
Institute, the Art Association and State
Development Company. The memorial is
signed by James 0. Phelan, Alfred Bou
vier, Henry J. Crocker. Joseph Â«'M. Leg
gett, Hugo D. Keil and J. Richard Freud.
The conclusions of the memorial are:
Firstâ A trades school should be located
where it will do the most good.
Secondâ That in this view San Francisco is
the most desirable location. And, -
Thirdâ That the Regents' and the Lick
trustees, acting : independently, yet in har
mony, have it lv their power, to provide a great
trades school; but if these forces are divided
two schools will result, both inefficient and in
adequate. '.'..
Therefore, we urge upon the . wisdom of the
Regents to confer with the Lick trustees, and
if arrangements as to site cannot be satisfac
torily arranged on .the land ; of the Lick
trustees, which is large enough for both, then |
this committee will seek a site in the neighbor
hood and offer it to the Regents. ; But the sug
gestion of the Lick trustees to make arrange- I
ments whereby a building now owned by j
them, but insufficiently equipped, shall be i
enlarged and made, exclusively a working j
trades school and called the Wilmerding i
School, having an independent faculty, will,
with least expense and .greatest * efficiency,
fullill the noble object of the trust established
by J. C. Wilmerding, a San Francisco citizen
and merchant during the forty years of his
career in the metropolis, where his wealth was
accumulated and to which he owed everthing
for the favors of his fortune.
The question then came up as to the
power of the Lick trustees to amalgamate.
Judge Wallace spoke on the subject, which
called out the suggestion that the ques
tion should be referred to j the . law com
mittee. : â¢ i
Horace Davis of the Lick board of trus
tees came in while r the point was under
discussion. It was his judgment that the
power to combine the Lick School with
another institution was not denied in the
trust. He said: "We have built a school:
It is a success, and we go right along
whether we co-operate ., or not, but we
think we can do better and broader work
by co-operating. We do not ; propose that
you should be our tenants. We should
like to have you come and acquire prop
erty in our neighborhood. ;â¢ We have had
experience and you can share the benefit
of that experience." "
; It was explained further in detail that
the course .of instruction could be ex
tended from fourteen branches now taught
to twenty-two, and furtli3r, that 250 pupils
of the Wilmerding School could be main
tained at :80 per cent of ' the ; income of
$400,000, and therefore experience to guide
the Regents in the future could be ac
quired without the sacrifice of any part
of the bequest. The $400,000 remaining
intact would , be increased by 20 per cent
of the income. _ : , "
Mr. Dohrmann, in,- addressing the
Regents, held that any experiment that
could be made without investing a large
portion of : th bequest in buildings and
lands should be commanded. The school,
he said, was not land and buildings, but
education. _'_. - â¢
The San Francisco committee was given
thirty days to submit other 1 propositions.
The offer pending was referred to the law
committee of. Regentsâ Rodgers, "Wallace
and Foote. '.-.' : â  .-. â¢
In answer to . inquiries from Governor
Budd, James D. Phelan said the San Jose
proposition! offering land 'near the Hotel
Vendome, was still open. *- '
The Stockton committee, consisting of I
H. J. Corcoran, P.' B. Fraser, L. D.Woods,
James Marsh. H. C. Shaw and Mrs. James
Gillis. was next heard, - >~
â¢ Mr. Corcoran! the chief spokesman, pre
sented his case with force and clearness.
The proposition pending as he understood
it was to give the San Francisco boy, who
now ~. has the chance to learn ;, fourteen
trades in the Lick ; School, the further
chance to learn twenty.two in a combined
school. What he desired was to give the
country boy a chance to learn one trade.
"If you want to help your poor boys in
San Francisco do , â¢ away v with trades
unions." : '.];:â â â â  % '";';'â }- ;i':Y'\'f '"-*;â 
Mr. Corcoran likened San Francisco to a
tcll-gatherer at the sea. The money was
gathered from the interior and; some of it
should be returned. He assured the re
gents that if- necessary public spirit of
Stockton . would - provide money for the
buildings in addition to the land. ;
â¢ Mrs. Gillis spoke of .'the demoralizing in
fluences of metropolitan life on the coun
try youth, and t mentioned the advantages
to the boy which country home would
afford. ,! Â» ;.' I '.' ; i f>';/* â â¢'â >,';â¢ \'~'i : -
William R. Davis, leader of the 'Alameda
delegation, then made a lucid explanation
of the pending ' propositions from that
county. He' spoke of the population' of
110,000 people there, and of the three ex
isting, trade schools in San ; Francisco,
which has 'a population of â¢ 350,000. To i
place the fourth school in, San Francisco
apd give none ;to Alameda County would
be unjust. ; He V thought * that - there was
danger of k the great nniversity /becoming
topheavy on the Francisco side.
Governor Budd raised the point that the
law, now : required a : school 'of mechanics'
arts to ; be 'â '. established at ; the :, university,
and to place the AVilmerding'school there
would be giving Alameda (t County two
schools of industrial art. : ; Vrl. â  A
. The " Oakland i committee, consisting â  of
W. R. Davis, P. E. Bowles and -R. M. Fitz
gerald, were given thirty days' > time, the
same as \ was given to "Stockton and San
Francisco, to supplement the offers.
'â¢! Regent Rodgers \ said ?he V had ', recently
talked with William Alvord and had 1 rea
son to hope from that convocation that a
brother of the late Mr. Wilmerding would
add to the . donation, as " there was a sur
plus in ; the estate -. for division. In . Ger- :
many, there : ' was > a Wilmerding .. chool
founded by one of the testator's ancestors^'
; M Rodgers said : "I th ink it is proper
and wise for.the board to -solve now not
to affiliate "the Wilmerding â  School with
any other school. |'i We should declare it to
he our 'â  policy to carry out expressly the
trust confided to us." \.' ; ' V ' â¢"â â *' ' '.".
Mr. Rodgers introduced : a . resolution in
line with his remarks, but it was not con
sidered proper in view of the fact that the
board had given the San Francisco repre
sentatives thirty days' time, and had re
ferred; their proposition -to the law com
mittee.
On motion of Superintendent Black, the
principals of Pasadena Poiytechnical
School, the Cogswell, Lick and San Fran
cisco Poiytechnical schools were invited to
come before the regents at the next meet
ing. .;-:, â¢-â :â ..
General : Houghton spoke of the proba
bility that the Pioneer Woolen-mills prop
erty in San Francisco, embracing large
and substantial buildings, might be offered
as a site for the school. ;.
Further consideration of the subject was
deferred until the regular meeting on the
second Tuesday in May.
New Irish-American Hall.
There was a large gathering of; those Inter

her penniless, and that Mrs. Minnie An

Mrs. Andrews in person denied that she
had been out of the City, and denounced
the insinuations of Mrs. Barton that any
thing other than platonic friendship ex
isted between her and the evangelist.
She admitted that she had visited Mr. Bar

collect the insurance money due her from
the death of her husband. .
Mr. Barton complained that '- his . wife
was continually running him in debt, not
withstanding that he. used to give her all
his money. Before he left this City about
a month ago he gave all: the furniture and
household goods to his wife, and she de
manded the key of the house from him,
thus virtually turning him out of doors.
He said that bis wife never worked
while he was with "her, but that she spent
her; time gadding about and' talking spir
itualism.: He was obliged last June, he
said, to advertise in The Call warning
tradesmen not to furnish her any credit
on his account.
He also contradicted the statement of
Rev. M. V. Meserve, pastor of the Union
square Free Baptist Church, to the effect
that Barton took a contract for repairing
the church and did the work unsatisfac
torily. The contract, he- said, had been
taken by Mr. Van Nortdel, Barton's part
ner in the carpentering and building busi
ness. Mr. Barton worked on the job and
Van Nortdel received the money.
The evangelist denounced . as utterly
false his wife s statement that he told her
she could make $500 by representing her
self as Mrs. Baddin. He also said that
the statement in the dispatch from Santa
Rosa to the effect that his uncle was at the
Palace Hotel in this City was a mistake.
It was the uncle of Mrs. Elizabeth Ayer,
secretary of Mr. Barton's society.
Mrs. â  Ayer . also returned from Santa
Rosa and the work of further evangeliza
tion will be proceeded with in this City, it
being Mr. Barton's intention to hire a hall
this week. The following is the card of the

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Speeches against the funding bill will

The committee funding bill is pretty
good as such bills go, but they don't go.

The more Carlisle squeezes, the turnip '

â¢
If there is no other way to beat the
funding bill, the people will pardon the j
Senate if it talks the job to death. ""'; V
Democracy would have a better chance ;
in this race if it would dismount from the
free-trade donkey and try it on foot.
From all reports, Alaska mining is a
very good thing to let alone, unless you i
have money enough to burn a wet dog.
There was a prospect that this would.be
a dull week in Congress, but it may turn !
out to be one of the liveliest of the ses- j
sion. 'â¢ *. ,-'- -
The objection on the part of some officials
to a City Hall directory may be due to a
fear that they might be found out too I
easily.
.
The crisis in the funding bill fight is at
hand, and now is the time for the protest- |
ing voice of the people to be heard louder !
than ever.
There is a prospect that the statesmen at: ;
Washington will soon finish their talk !
about foreign affairs and return to work on

As the Government cannot borrow
money at 2 per cent, it would be some
thing worse than folly to fund the railroad
debt at that rate.
There is enough enthusiasm for McKin

the people regard the tariff as the biggest
issue in the campaign.
Whatever name may be given to the '
funding bill when reported to Congress, it j
will be' known to the people as the Hunt- i
ington bill, nnd that is enough to kill it.?'
â,,' The chief popular interest in the Presi

contest for victory at St. Louis. . When
that is settled the rest will , be a walkover.
No Democrat has yet appeared as a can

It is hardly worth while to discuss the
details of the funding bill, since the prin

The only right rule is the enforcement of
the law. â¢â¢
It looks as if Martin Kelly and Jerry

THE RAILROAD ! BILL.
The outline of the funding bill which
appeared in 'yesterday's Call represents
merely the. work of a member of the joint
sub-committee appointed for that pur
pose after a conference of the * sub-com
mittee and an agreement on the terms to
be embodied in the draft. It will have to
be approved by the sub-committee before
submission to the general joint commit
tee of both houses. After such approval,
if it is accorded, the bill will go to the re
spective houses for debate and final action.
This is a" tedious road for the bill to travel,
and it is impossible at this time to foretell
the result. The situation is further com
plicated by a provision that the terms
of the bill shall be accepted by the roads
interested.
The bill therefore is hardly worthy of
much discussion at this juncture. â :. Still as
it is very different from what has been ex
pected it may be well to point out some of
its peculiarities. .;.. To begin with, it '< is
much severer in its requirements of the
aided lines than either the Smith or the
Frye bill or than the railroads have ex
pressed their ability or willingness to meet.
It requires, for instance, that during the
first ten years the companies shall pay,
in addition to the interest of. 2 cent on
the bonds. $300,000 annually, $500,000 an
nually during the succeeding , ten _ years,
and thereafter $750,000 annually until the
whole debt is extinguished;, that these
payments shall' be , applied . to the
extinguishment of existing bonds; that
the Government's lien shall re
main . in .. force V until; the debt is
wholly extinguished,' the /charter life
of the companies being extended to cover
the entire period; that at any lime, if the
President shall so decide, the outstanding
debt shall be taken up by the Government,
the companies to be. required in such a
contingency _ to - reimburse the â¢ Govern
ment for all costs and Tosses; that the
Central Pacific may if it choose refund its
outstanding debt at a lower rate of in
terest, under the sanction of the Govern
ment, in order, that the. amount of the
debt and the time for its. extinguishment
may be lessened;" that in the event of de
fault for six- months in; interest or prin
cipal the President may take possession
of the roads- without resort to the courts,
or may employ- the courts in his dis
cretion ; that the companies shall pay no
dividends until, after the current Govern
ment obligations have been canceled, and
not then unless they have been earned;
and that the Central Pacific shall so modify
its lease to the Southern Pacific as to
make the Southern Pacific a guarantor of
the Central Pacific payments provided for
in the bill. '-" . â¢ â  â¢ ' . .'. '
This is a rough outline of the salient
features of the measure. It has nothing
to commend it. It completely sets aside
the principle* for which the people have
contended, namely, the power and duty of
the Government to collect the debt by sale
under foreclosure. Viewed in 'the' light of
a simple business transaction the exten
sion of the debt is, the introduction of, a
dangerous precedent, for which the
country' may suffer far beyond the evils
which will clearly result immediately
from its operation in this particular case.
It should never be reported to Congress,
for it is iniquitous all through. There is
but one thing to do with i*. Kill it.
FREIGHT PROM ABROAD.
The Supreme Court of the United States
has rendered an important decision in rul
ing that the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion shall not require railroads to charge
equal rates on eights imported into this
country for interior forwarding . and
freights originating -at the points of im
portation. Thus it is ruled that the Texas
and Pacific Railroad may charge less for
imported freight goods laid down in New
Orleans for shipment to Western terminals
than for American goods sent by rail from
New Orleans to the same destinations. As
of course the ruling is general in its appli
cation all the railroads of the country may
if they choose discriminate against Ameri
can goods and in favor of foreign articles.
The circumstances under which they are
likely to take advantage of this decision
are those growing out of the water com
petition. For instance, articles i produced
in Europe might be -sent y across the At
lantic and round Cape Horn to California
by sailing vessels. It would be to the in
terest of the transcontinental railroads to
offer such inducements in the way of low
rates as would secure them the freight,
but this could not be done unless lower
rates are charged than would be profitable
in the handling of American products.
This is particularly. the case with regard to
freights between New Orleans and San
Francisco ;by reason of the longer water
distance separating ... the two places. That
is to say, transportation charges within
certain limits rave quite as .important an
effect on American industries as an im
port tariff could have. This* presents a
novel and serious condition of affairs, and
discloses a railroad power that was never
foreseen. ...._:. Â.
How Congress should deal with this
new problem is a matter for serious con
sideration. It is not desirable that rail
roads, honestly managed and carrying
debts fairly contracted,. should be unduly
hampered in the conduct of their busi
ness, but their interests are not the only
concern of the people. It is not a trifling
consideration that to a certain extent rail
roads have tbe power to nullify the good
effect of a "protective tariff. ' The Repub
lican party, which has faithfully adhered
to its policy of protecting American" indus
tries, is compelled, by this decision to
realize that a factor wholly independent of
a tariff has injected itself info the question
and that it calls for wise treatment.
Such a highway as the Nicaragua canal,
which would greatly reduce the time and
cost of transportation as compared with
the Cape Horn route, would apparently
compel .the railroads ;to abandon all at
tempts to compete for the trade of Europe
over the area affected by the canal. That
highway would accomplish the additional
benefit of regulating railroad charges be
tween Atlantic and Pacific ports, and as
this regulation would be in the hands of
the United States Government, it could be
managed with that wisdom *" which would
strike an even balance between the inter
ests of the transportation' companies and
those of ', the * people without working in
jury to either. .This would completely re
move the constant danger of such com
binations among â¢ transportation compa
nies as have no regard for the progress of
the country.
r OPPOSING INVESTIGATION.
The attempt oh Monday to call up the
Senate resolutions providing for .a ; select
committee to investigate the recent â  bond
issues was met ; by a ; prompt objection
from Senator Hill, and as that gentleman
has now established himself as the* repre
sentative of the administration in the Sen
ate, it is a fair "assumption that Cleveland
will exert all' his influence to escape any
form of inquiry into the subject. â¢
In the .very nature of \ things an opposi
tion on the part of the â  administration to
an investigation of the kind -proposed will'
raise v suspicions that ; there r have -been
some transaction in connection with the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, , APRIL 1, 1896.
j bond issues which those responsible for
them would gladly keep hidden. These
suspicions will revive in the public mind
all the scandals connected with the syndi
cate deal. : The people will , recall that the
deal with the syndicate was made secretly,
that the bonds were issued for much less
than their market value as was shown by
the prices brought when the syndicate
offered tliem for sale, and finally that near
friends of the President were closely asso
ciated with the syndicate, which was thus
allowed to make an enormous profit at no
risk to themselves. . &OSi- :
Patriotic Americans have been averse to
believe that Cleveland . himself made any
profit out of the deal, or that any moral
turpitude on his part was : involved in it.
It is not pleasant to suspect a President of
the United States of playing on a great
scale the part of a boodling Alderman and
pocketing money derived from corrupt
jobs. Nevertheless, even the most patri
otic and those least suspicious of the
President's honor have felt that the scan
dal of thedeal was sufficiently discreditable
to the administration to render an investi
gation necessary. The friends of the Pres
ident should, in fact, be the first to ask
for such an inquiry, and thus make mani
fest their confidenceâ if not in the wisdom
of his policy, at least in the integrity of
his honor.
Under these circumstances it is mortify
ing to find the recognized leader of the ad
ministration forces in Congress vigorously
opposing any attempt to begin an investi
gation which would make known the in
side facts of a deal with which scandal has
been so busy. We are on the eve of a
Presidential election when the acta of the
administration must be submitted to the
people for their judgment. The bond is
sues, and particularly the one carried out
by a secret deal with the Morgan â¢. syndi
cate, are sure to occupy a large part of
public attention during the campaign., ,If
it is seen that the administration is trying
to conceal anything in connection with
these issues the people wil' be sure to draw
a conclusion .adverse ', to the character of
those concerned in them.
The matter is too grave to be set aside
lightly. -Any concealment, or attempt at
concealment, the circumstances, will
be tantamount to a confession of wrong
doing. In his first campaign, under try
ing circumstances,: in the face of facts
gravely affecting his character, Mr. Cleve
land bade his friends to tell the truth. It
is now time for him to repeat that act of
wisdom. Let the truth be known.
INDIGNANT MERCHANTS.
The letter addressed by the Merchants'
Association to the City Hall Commission
ers reminding them that public officers are
not greater than the source of their power
is one of the most interesting local docu-
ments of recent times. The letter, more
over, is so calm and dignified it commands
respect on that account alone. It is a pro
test against the somewhat flippant resent
ment with ' which the Commissioners
treated the association's suggestions con
cerning a directory for the City Hall.
This convenience has long been needed,
as without it there is grea* difficulty in
finding the offices in the rambling house.
The cost would be trivialâ something like
$125â and yet the matter has been unrea
sonably delayed.
These extracts from the letter are worthy
of study: "There is not the slightest dis
position to trespass upon the official duties
of any public servant. Composed of citi
zens and taxpayers of San Francisco,
united for the purpose of municipal prog
ress and improvement, the Merchants' As
sociation feels perfectly justified in calling
attention to any improvement in the mu
nicipal government that promises to re
sult to the public good. This association,
we think, has a right to expect that all
officials in our municipal government
will meet its suggestions in the same
kindly spirit in which they are tendered.
Though there may be differences of opin
ion as to certain measures, no ill-feeling or
bitterness need be engendered."
This is a straightforward and dignified
assertion of the right of the people to ex
press an opinion concerning the character
of the service which their employes should
render. There is a difference between
idle, meddlesome, selfish and unintelli
gent suggestions from irresponsible per
sons and the kind of requests presented
by such a body as the Merchants' Associa
tion. The indifference of citizens to pub
lic interests explains the unhappy order
of things in which servants have come to
assume the role of masters. The City Hall
Commission is composed of intelligent
men. and undoubtedly the individual side
remarks resenting the suggestions of the
Merchants'' Association were an inadver
tence, intended more as a pleasantry than a
serious expression of opinion; but the re
marks gave an opportunity for the asso
ciation to express in general terms an idea
that cannot be lost sight of without injury
to the public interests, and- a lowering of
the dignity with which public officers
should conduct the business intrusted to
them. . w .
A- TIMELY. SUBSIDY.
In the provision of the postoffice appro
priation bill reported to the Senate that
additional compensation to the extent of
$80,000 be made to the Oceanic Steamship
Company for carrying the : mails between
San Francisco, New South Wales,' New
Zealand, Hawaiian Islands and the islands
of the Pacific Ocean ; there - lies a promise
that Congress has awakened to the danger
threatening our commercial standing with
the countries and islands of the South Pa
cific, and that it is disposed to lend its as
sistance in protecting the interests of . the
merchants, producers and $ manufacturers
of this country against the keen and ener
getic competition of Canada, aided by its
mother country. '
When a line of steamers was first put on
to ply between Vancouver, B. C, and the
Orient, little apprehension was felt by the
San Francisco merchants interested in the
trade with Japan and China. It was
thought that the extent .of the . industries
of our northern neighbor would not war
rant a continuance of r the project. But
despite this local view of the situation
that line t has not only been maintained,
but has continued to grow in importance.
It . is ; true \ that this r is , not due 'to , any
natural advantages. Liberal subsidies
from the home country "made it possible
for that line to compete successfully with
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company and
the Occidental _ ; and Oriental â¢ Steamship :
Company for the trade and traffic of the
Orient, and a similar "policy, emulated by
the Colonies, has brought about the estab
lishment of a competing line of steamers
between Vancouver and Australia. With
out munificent subsidies the maintenance
of these lines would be \ virtually \ impossi
ble. Under these circumstances 'the drily;
salvation for the American trans-Pacific
carriers lies in the protection afforded by
the Federal Government by resort to sub
sidies. ' "'. V-.'.'-* .. \ * ,

THE NIPSIC'S PROPELLER.
Almost every one has heard of. the wreck of
the man-of-war Nipsic in -the awful hurricane
that piled her bones on the beach at Samoa
on March 15, 1880.*: During the year 1891-92
a large amount of her machinery was brought
to this port, where it was taken in charge by
the naval officials. Among it was the lost
ship's propeller wheel, . that showed the
peculiar. freaks of the storm to such a marked
degree that it has been mounted and put on
exhibition at the Mare Island navy-yard.
The wheel has been placed close beside the
main road just back of the foundries. It is on
a base of stone raised about a foot above
ground. Only the hub rests on the founda
tion, the blades projecting over sides.
There are several \ strange things' aoout ' the

Bronze is the material of which the wheel is

a perfect circle. It is impossible to conceive of
the I forces that caused j this, as there | are no
marks or indentations on any part of the blade
to â  indicate â  that ; it was . thrown - against . the
rocks. Nor , does it seem possible that the
wheel became twisted by becoming entangled
with ropes while it - was . running at full speed
in the effort to keep the ship's head to the sea.

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Remarkably Smart Round Trip
of the American Bark
Wilna.
HER CAPTAIN EARNED A BONUS
The New Board of Port Wardens Took
Office With Major Harney as ! \'*
President. , J I
The. American bark Wilna covered her
self with, glory yesterday when she com
nleted the round trip between this port
and Nanaitno, B. C, ' in 16 days 7 hours.
This is twenty-four hours better than the
trip of the El well and will stand as a
record for runny a day to. come. After
passing Cape Flattery the Wilna was be
calmed for thirty hours, after which she
caught a fair wind and came bowling along
at steamboat speed. -Sunday last she be
calmed again, and then she caught the
strong northwester that blew all of Mon
day and it carried her right to the bar. All
in all the vessel was becalmed over forty
hours, so her 111.1 down the coast is all the
more remarkable.
During the last three months three of
the vessels managed by W. E. Migholl
have broken , the record, and on each oc
casion the master received a present of
$10: and a suit of clothes. The first one to
do the trick was Captain McLeod. in the
E. K. Wood; then came Captain Ryder's
famous run of 17 1 ays 7 hours in the
E'.well. and now Captain Slater has
eclipsed all previous efforts. Captain
Mighell's agreement with his skip
pers is that if the round trin is
made under 20 days that secures a bonus of
$100 and a new suit of clothes. If they
make it under 30 days they get $50 and a
new suit of clothes.
During the last month or so Captain
Slater has been 'experimenting with the
rig of the "\Yilna. She now carries two
gaff topsails and one immense jib. The
genial master Is so pleased with the inno
vation that in future he intends to recom
mend it to other masters.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Willamette Valley arrived from Mexican
ports yesterday with the following passen
gers : ;'.;- '. .'â¢'

She brought a very light cargo, but con
siderable gold and silver ore, which will be
taken to Selby's smelting works to-day.
On her next trip the Willamette Valley
will be known as the Orizaba.
The old Board of Port Wardens retired
â¢ from office yesterday and Messrs. Harnev,
Attwood and Provost assumed control.
Captain Gage, on behalf- of the retiring
board, seated the. new members and the
work of organizing at once began. Major
Harney was elected president and there
was considerable balloting over the
secretaryship. There were a number of
candidates, but J. Harrigan, the incum
bent, secured the position. He has held
the office through three administrations
and a better man for the place could not
be found.
_ When the steamer Hattie Gage sailed for
Â£arluk yesterday there was an intimation
The American Bark Wilna Breaking the Record Between Nanaitno, B. C, and
San Francisco.
[Sketched by a *'Call" artist.]
given by the custom-house officer in
charge that there would be trouble be
fore she got to sea. He reported that
there was considerable whisky aboard that
did! not appear on the' vessel's manifest,
and a search was ordered. ; As the steamer
was ': passing Lombard-street wharf the
revenue cutter Hartley put out after her,
but the Gage did not stop; A race ensued
'and 1 the steamer was overhauled: and
'.taken back' to ; Meiggs wharf. There she
was overhauled and fifteen gallons of
whisky were found among 'the cannerj
men's baggage. It was â  all ' in- demijohns
and they asserted it was for their own pri
vate use. This did not satisfy the customs
officials, however,? and the stuff was con-:
fiscated. Later ' the Hattie Gage I was ' al
lowed' to proceed to ; sea. - There was con
siderable whisky on. the vessel, but it was
all duly manifested, and the owners of the
vessel thought they were not breaking the
law in allowing the men to take along a
limited Supply for themselves. As there
were only eighteen men aboard there was
not 'a gallon of liquor apiece for a : twenty
day run to Karluk.; ..".â¢'

i of a cyclery on Market street.
A few days ago Northoff purchased a
bicycle from Varney, which he ordered
shipped to San Diego. In payment be
nave him a check for $120 on the Bank of
San Diego, purporting to be signed by
Jesse Grant, son of ex- President Grant.
The net cost of the bicycle was $104 50 and
Northoff received $15 50 in cash, being the.
difference between the amount of the
check and the cost of the machine. Var
ney was a little suspicious of the genuine
ness of the check and did not ship the bi
cycle till he ascertained whether 'it was all
right.;
On Monday Northoff went to the Cen
tral Bank in Oakland and asked the pay
ins teller to cash a check for him. It was
signed 11. N. Northoff and was drawn on
the San Diego bank. The bank officials
asked him to wait for a few minutes and
communicated with the police. Detective
Dennj- Holland went to the bank and
placed Northoff under arrest despite his
protests.
Chief Lloyd put the wires in motion and
received a message from Los Angeles that
Northoff was wanted there for forgery and
grand larceny. He also received a message
from here that Northoff was wanted for
pas-sing the forged check on Varney.
Yesterday morning Detective" Harry
Reynolds |went to Oakland with the war
rant for Northoff's arrest and brought him
across the bay to the City Prison.
Northoff is a well-dressed man of gen-
tleraaniy appearance and he declares that
his arrest is all a mistake, but the police
believe he is a '.'smooth worker" and are
making inquires about him.

DEATH OF FRED GIBSON.
-- . . :
The Noted Sportsman Surrenders
to the Ravages of Con
sumption. â  ."-.'V:
HIS CAREER A CHECKERED ONE
The Pain of His Last Hours Soothed
by the Comforting Presence of
His Mother.
Fred Gibson, famed throughout the
State as a sportsman, died in his apart-
FRED GIBSON, THE NOTED SPORTING MAN. WHO HAS JUST PASSED AWAY.
[Drawn from a photograph.] . , . l;' 7
raents at the Carrollton, corner Market
street and Golden Gate avenue, yesterday
afternoon at five minutes after 2 o'clock.
The immediate cause of death was con
sumption.
The body now lies at the embalmer's.and
some time to-day will be shipped to Sac
ramento for interment, where his family
lives, and where a brother and sister,; who
preceded him in crossing the dark river,
are buried. During the last moments of
the sick man his suffering was calmed by
the soothing presence, of bis mother, who
came to this City as soon ,as she learned
that the illness of her son was serious.
About four years ago Gibson was troubled
with blood-poisoning, and it was found
necessary to perform an operation in order
to relieve him. At the expiration of the
operation, three competent physicians,
who remained in constant attention on
him, gave it as their opinion at his bed
side that the hours of his life could be
numbered on the fingers, of one hand.
Such was, the remarkable vitality of the
man, however, that he recovered, but
never again was "strong physically.
Two months ago it was found necessary
to perform another operation, which tool:
place iif the German Hospital of this City.
His weakened constitution was unable to
withstand the strain, an i his friends think
the last operation oniy hastened "his de
cease. __
Fred Gibson began life as a peanut
butcher on one of the Southern Pacific's
lines. His was a checkered career. Though
only 34 years old when death overtook
him, he had seen : more of life in all its
phases than most octogenarians.
For many years he resided in Sacra
mento, but a few years ago a wandering
spirit took passession of him, ami, in com-
Eany with W. C. Cook, the companion of
is boyhood, he went to Soutu Africa to
see if there was an opening in business.
After a lengthy sojourn.- and after passing
through many stirring scenes, his opinion
of that region may best be summed up in
his own language. ''There is no opening
here for any foreigners that come from
America." - 3
Gibson and Cook then made a lengthy
tour : of the Continent, â¢ passing through
Paris, London, Dublin, Berlin and many
other places of interest. c : Two years ago
from the 12th of last January , the two
came to San Francisco and started the
well-known resort, "Our House," on Mar
ket street. Their financial gains have been
heavy. â Â â  . * c - __
It is said of Gibson that his word was as
good as his oath. His friends could be
found in any place of prominence in the
State. No pauper was ever . turned away
from his door, and no street-beggar ever
besought alms at his hands in vain.rtV'
Gibson left a widow, Mrs. Delia A. Gib
son; to whom he was married â ". fourteen
years ago in Sacramento. None of ., the
children resultant from this union have
survived. " ,'.-; -
The funeral will be held Thursday.
AULT IS ACQUITTED.
A Jury Decides 1 hat He . Did Not
Beat His "Little Daughter
..-â ' Lizzie. .-."' y â '
Joseph Ault, ex- secretary of the Stan
dard Oil Company.* was acquitted by a jury
in Judge Low's court last evening ofthe
charge of cruelty to his little daughter
Lizzie. ' ':'â¢"' : . â¢â /."â 
The charge was made that on Saturday,
March 21, Ault struck the little girl several
blows on the face with his closed fist,
knocking two of her teeth down her
throat, blacking her eyes and bleeding her
nose.-- .' ' . â .."''';.-'-. :''â .-â¢
The little girl was allowed to testify, but
she said her father ]; never struck her nor
whipped her, and no one had coached her
what to say.
Aristides Pondi, butcher,- 1071 Mission
street, whose shop adjoins the house occu
pied by Ault, testified to seeing the blows
struck and' begging Ault not Â» to kill the
child. Other witnesses testified as i : to the
condition of the child's face. â¢
A number of, witnesses for the defense I
testified that the little girl had accounted
'to them for her blackened eyes and swollen
nose by s saying she had been swinging /on'
a ladder in the yard and had fallen, her
face striking against the ladder. Mrs. Ault
testified thai she I pulled the two teeth \ out
of the girl jaw herself as they were loose.

Beginning Thursday, 1 April 2, the ; ; mail
and express for Ukiah and intermediate
points will depart from Tiburon ferry,
San Francisco,' at 7:30 ia. . m., '. daily. This
changes the old schedule of 7:40 a. M. on
week days to 7:30 a. m., and that of 8 a. m.
on Sundays to 7:30 a. m. |
The Sonoma Valley Express will leave

THE JEWISH SOCIALISTS
Enthusiastic Meeting â¢at Their
Hall on Folsom
Street. '
Civic and Social Questions Exhaust
ively Discussed by a Number of
Able Orators.
No bonds of race or creed seem to limit
the far-reaching influence of socialism.
Last night's meeting of the Jewish branch
of the Socialistic Labor party, at which
Harris Bernard presided, simply demon
strated that the Hebrew residents of the
City are fully alive to the questions which
are at present commanding the attention
of the thinking world. The hall at 907
Folsom street was crowded with fine
speakers and eager listeners, and interest
was apparent.
John Reynolds, one of the first speakers,
dealt with the civil "question. He con
tended that the perfect citizen should be
able to meet all issues of the day, but the
majority of men, he said, were not capable
of holding their own against smooth jug
glers in speech. The civil question nowa
days was, he said, used to throw dust in
the eyes of the * ignorant. Women, he
thought, might do much good in this de
partment of public life, but he regretted to
see that women appeared to hang back in
the socialistic fight. - â 
Mark Leitens, the next speaker, said
that civilization should cultivate mankind
physically, mentally and spiritually. He
believed that the | present state of things
ignored the last-named requisite, and was
in so far defective. * .â â "â  ,
Comrades Doherty, Hechtmann and
Ratner spoke . in the same strain, Mr.
Hechtmann . inveighing particularly
against the capitalists. He said Mr. Cleve
land was a gcod President for the present
capitalistic regime,. but he believed a new
regime would soon commence.
:'.;.; Before the adjournment the president
called the attention of all present to the
ball to be given under : the auspices of the
society next Sunday night. ..-:.
*' To-morrow; night , the "society will hold
another meeting, at which several" distin
guished orators | are expected to * speak.
The Jewish branch of the Socialistic Labor
party is evidently, in a flourishing con
dition. . .'~,;V . ': ~

GRADING LAFAYETTE PARK
A Large ; Force of Men and
Horses Now Engaged in
the Work. ;
SOME BIG CUTS TO BE MADE.
A Portion of the Eastern Side of
the Park Still in Liti- -
gation.
Lafayette Park, bounded by Gough,
Washington, Sacramento' and Laguna
streets, is being graded in order to have it
fitted for the purposes for which it was
originally intended. The two blocks
claimed by Holladay are being left un
touched.
The Supreme Court at Washington de
cided that the two blocks bounded by
Sacramento, Octavia, Washington and
Laguna streets were the property of the
City and County, and also one 50-vara lot
on the northeast section of Cough and
Washington, leaving Mr. Ilolladay in pos
session of the center of the two blocks
bounded by Sacramento, Gough, Wash
ington and Octavia streets, leaving the
ownership of a portion of the southeast
corner at Sacramento and Gough to be
hereafter decided.
The two blocks from Octavia to Laguna,
between Sacramento and Washington
streets, are now undergoing a transform^-"
tion. - Men and horses are at work
leveling tlie western slope. The con
tract for the grading was awarded to Cap
tain John Tuttle for $17,500 by the Super
visors. To get the/grounds into the de
sired condition 50,000 cubic yards of earth
must be removed, 7000 yards of this
being rich loam. Head Gardener C. W.
Love has had this loam dumped on a por
tion of the park, from where it can be con
veniently taken and used as dressing for
the surface when the graders' work shall
have been finished. : I
The work of putting this ground into
condition for a park entails a considerable
amount of labor. The highest portion is
on the line oi Octavia street, where a cut
of eighteen feet must be made at the in
tersection of Octavia and Washington
streets. From there the natural contour
slopes gradually toward Octavia street.
The base of the whole presents the usual
red-rock formation so prevalent in the
hills around San Francisco.
Some blasting must be done on the side
facing Washington street, but to this
operation the neighboring residents have
entered no objection.
Captain . Tattle is desirous of finishing
the work with all possible dispatch, and
to this end he has 100 horses and 200 men
engaged, and he has erected all . the
facilities for feeding and housing both
men and horses right on the ground.
An idea of the value of this : property,
for which there was such a long and bitter
lu-ht, may be seen by the recent purchase
of two 50-vara lots bought by Irving M.
Scott for $90,000. These lots are on the
corners just opposite the western end of
the square.

Mrs. Olga Deuss, the Unfortunate Woman Who Asphyxiated Her Baby Children and Herself, and
T H. O. Deuss, the Distracted and Half-Crazed Husband Who Mourns Their Loss.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
Wandering about the City, begging his
watchful friends to leave him alone but a
few moments, H. 0. Deuss is yearning for
merciful death that might bring him ob
livion. His sorrow is so overwhelming
and has crowded in upon him so suddenly
that in his distracted condition he sees no
way out of it but suicide, since his piteous
appeals to God to call for him are un
heeded.
All the dear ones he cherished and
loved his honest and true wife who had
been his comfort for eleven years, his
three little babes, whose bright and pretty
faces gave sunlight to his home, and whose
chatter as they climbed over him in tbe
evening when he returned from his tedi
ous labor, and their merry laughter at
early morn before he again went forth to
battle with the world made him forget all
his caresâ all were taken away from him
in one fell swoop.
It is hardly to be wondered at that the
unfortunate husband and father weeps,
sobs and at times utters groans terminat
ing in a painful hysterical laugh.
He regards the friends who have has
tened to his side to give him consolation
which is out tame in such a heartbreaking
case as merciless because they will not
permit him to do away with himself and
join the darlings who have left him here
alone in his misery.
This tragedy of the little home at 809 }Â£ !
Guerrero street, where H. O. Deuss sud
denly and so unexpectedly came across
the dead bodies of hi? entire family at 3:15
o'clock yesterday morning, is probably
the saddest that has e\er befallen an indi
vidual in this City. At least, the hard
ened employes of the public Morgue do
not remember a case so touching. Deputy
Smith, who for the past twenty years has
gathered in the dead when official investi
gation has been necessary, does not recol
lect '&: case that approaches it, and the
tender care he has taken in laying out the
mother with her little babies on either
tide â four resting on three contiguous
slabs covered by "one wide, immaculate
sheetâ attests to the feelings which caused
the old veteran to shed a tear.
Smith was not alone among strangers
to weep yesterday while viewing these
dead. Women, neighbors of the Deuss
family, . crowded to. the Morgue. Men â
big, strongmen, callous to the shocks and
hardships of the world, who have not
known for decades what it is to have a
moist eye â cried with the weaker sex, and
bad to turn away.
The details of the tragedy, owing to the
crazed condition ; of the husband and
father, who alone is in possession of the
facts connected with the immediate find
ing of the bodies, can be but surmised.
He left his prattling young ones after
the evening meal Monday about 7:30
o'clock.
The babies had had a glorious day of it
with their toys and little girl neighbors,
with whom they had loruped from early
morning. That bed time was drawing hear
was evinced by their drooping eyelids,
and their fond mother's lullaby needed
but to be short before. the three darlings
would be in the restful land of nod. .
Mrs. Olga Deuss saw her husband to the
door. She, too, was tired, and with her
parting kiss asked him to .return early.
There was nothing in her demeanor to in
dicate the awful deed she afterward com
mitted. True, she had been ailing for a
week past, but die was apparently mend
ing and was looking forward to Thursday,
when she expected to give a children's
party in honor of her elder daughter
Gretchen's eighth birthday. .'.
At what time she locked the doors of
the house, tucked her little ones in their
cots, turned Jon all the gas jets in the
house and lay down to die no one can ever
know. She left a couple of messages writ
ten in German and scribbled off in a rather
disconnected manner. But these give no
details to enlighten one on the case.
One slip of paper has an incompleted
sentence which reads:
You are going â
What else the woman intended to write
cannot be surmised, unless she was about
to address her husband, who had told her
he was going to the monthly meeting of
the Mission Turn Verein, and then de
sisted. ;
Then came another note, saying:
.-.,= . . â¢* ***
As I have loved you in life, I shall be with
you in death all the time. â '.'..
On the same slip of paper was written:
All the things in the trunk and the beds are
to be sent to George; they belong to him.
- These messages were found by the depu
ties from the Coroner's office when they
arrived at the house at 5 o'clock in the
morning. They had been completely over
looked by Deuss in the agonizing moments
that followed his frightful discovery.
At the close of the Mission Turn Verein
meeting, about midnight, Deuss sat around
the saloon in the building chatting with
some of his fellow-members and drinking
beer.
:".: At 2:30 o'clock in the morning the party
broke up, and Deuss, accompanied by An
ton Messersmith, who is a neighbor of his,
slowly walked toward their homes. , They
' conversed, and frequently stopped on their
journey to ''enter in debate. They spent
fifteen minutes in this way right in front
eof Deusa' house, where his entire family
âwas being slowly asphyxiated or else was
already dead.
With a light heart and the proverbial
excuse on bis lips for being so 'late, Deuss
ran up tbe 'front steps of bis home ana
with his latch key opened the door.
The gas jet in the hallway at the head of ;
j the flight of stairs leading to his flat was
| not lighted, and there was a strong odor
i of gas. His first thought was that a gust
! of wind had blown out the light, and he
hastened to turn the cock. It was securely
| closed, however, and Deuss felt for the
' first time that something was amiss. The j
1 stifling odor became stronger as he entered
j the front room of the dwelling, and he ,
i rushed to the door of the apartments '
where his wife and babies usually slept.
It was closed and locked.
"Olga! Olga 1" he cried, thumping the >
! door. "Olga! What's the matter, can't ;
you answer?"
No answer came from the dead on the
other tide of the door; only the noise of
the death-dealing fluid escaping as with |
a serpent's hiss from four gas jets turned i
on at full force could be heard.
Frenzied by the uncertainty of the situa
tion, and made doubly powerful by the
possibility of his loved ones being in !
danger of their lives within a few feet of !
where he stood, Deuss braced himself for '
a plunge, and launched his entire weight |
against the door.
It broke in. and though stifled by the I
volume of gas which burst out against !
him as if fighting for its victims, he dcs- I
i perately lunged through the broken panel j
I of the door, and at a bound reached the
bed where lay his wife and their youngest
boy.
"My God, Olga!" he fairly shrieked,
shaking her, "wake up! wake up!"
The unfortunate woman was already too
far gone to recover, although she was not
yet quite dead. Deuss then hurled him
self against the large, and only window
leading from the room in the rear of the
flat. With one vigorous kick he smashed
i the casing and a blast of welcome fresh air
i poured in. In another moment the fren
\ zied father ran and opened the windows in
i the front of the house, and returning to
j the bedroom he began lifting his dear ones
'. from their conches and carrying them to
i where the fresh air could reach them.
It did not take long for him to do this,
| but the seconds seemed hours to him.
! While engaged in. his task he Kept up. a
! continual cry for help, which did not come.
! His cries, however, were heard, but at that
j unwonted hour they were unheeded.
Deuss pulled the pillows off the beds,
I and after placing them under the heads of
: his babies and wife he staggered back
down the stairs and out into the street,
\ running toward the house of his friend,
i Anton Messersmith, and yelling like a
! demented man all the way.
-
Messersmith returned with Deuss, and
with Officer Murphy, on the Guerrero
street beat, they entered tbe house. It
was evident then" that there was not a
spark of life left in the four bo|fces, but
Drs. Moody and Mulligan, living in th
immediate neighborhood, were summoned.
At their suggestion the officials at the
Morgue were notified.'^^^^^^^jjJÃJÃÃ
As soon as the anxious father, bendins
over the physicians during their examina
tion, learned that there was no more hope,
he fell back half-fainting into the arras of
his friend, Messersmith. Then/rallying,
he was on his knees, crawling from one to
the other of his four beloved darlings,
kissing and begging them to come back.
"Olga! Gretchen! Fredda! Carl! My
darlings. .Don't leave papa! don't leave
papa! Come back; oh, come back!" he
begged, while the tears streamed down
his cheeks.
The sight of this terrible sorrow was too
much for the physicians and Messersmith,
who were unable to withhold their feel
Gretchen Deuss. Aged 8 Years ; Carl Deuss, Aged 2 Years and 6 Months, and
Frida Deuss, Aged 5 Years and 6 Months, Asphyxiated by Their Mother.

! ings, and they wept too with the bereaved
Messersmith managed to tear the un
happy man from the corpses into another
room, where ho cast himself face down
; ward on the bed so recently . occupied by
' his wife and youngest child and sobbed as
I though his heart were breaking.
Deputies Hallet and McGinnis, from the
Coroner's office, arrived shortly afterward
in their matter-of-fact way with the grew-,
some wagon to convey the dead. They
carried the receiving-boxes up the stairs
to the rooms where lay the corpses. They
had not expected such a sad scene, and as
they glanced on the three little babies in
their snow-white gowns clustered about
their mother, and saw the heartbroken
father standing by, calling on the Almighty
to also take him, those two deputies
thought of their own wives and children
and wept as they performed theii sad
duties. . :
As the bodies were about to be removed
Deputy Hallett called the attention of
Officer Murphy to the actions of Deuss.
He was carrying on like an insane man,
his bloodshot eyes were popping out of
their sockets, and he seemed on the verge
of doing something to harm himself.
He suddenly' darted for .the bureau,
â where he fumbled in trying to open the
top drawer. This gave the policeman time
to reach him as he opened it and attempt
ed to take a razor from its sheath.
"I don't want to live! I can't stand
this any longer!" Deuss cried. V.-..'
The keen blade was carefully put away,
and Deuss, looking around, picked up one
of his own business cards, giving his occu
pation as a watchmaker and jeweler at 126
Kearny street, in the Thurlow block. ..'_; On
the back of it he wrote : '.'â '. 1
George F. Ki/eger,
199 S. Clart street,
Chicago.
Turning to Deputy Coroner Hallett, he
said:
"If anything happens to me let this man
know, and he will know what to do."
Another friend of Deuss, hearing of the
1 tragedy, called at the house.
"Well, Frick," the unfortunate man
said, "see what has befallen me. What
; an unhappy man I am. My poor wife and
babies, all gone."
Deuss began to act stranger than ever
I after that. Taking a gold watch from his
pocket he handed it to the nearest person
!to him. .- -â  - I
"Take this," he said, "it belongs to
i Shirfield." â  , ; .: .
Then, reaching into his pocket again he
| pulled out $12 In one hand and handed it
to Deputy Hallett, saying:
"That belongs to Oiga."
In another hand he held a little bundle
i of coin, about $1 80, wrapped up in a piece
of paper. .'-_.",**
"This," he said, "belongs to â â ." He
did not finish the sentence, but went off
i at a rambling and unintelligible wordy

The address of George : H. Kueger,\Chi-

note she wrote on earth. -^
Deuss insisted upon accompanying his
wife and babies to the Morgue, where he
viewed their bodies^ on the slabs. He
acted in a comparatively rational manner
while weeping and kissing his dead.
Shortly after noontime he was induced
by his friend Frick to leave the place, an d
both went out to arrange for the funeral.
Late in the afternoon an attempt was
made to have Deuss lie down and get some
rest in the Valencia-street Hotel. His
friend remained by him until shortly after

5 o'clock in the afternoon, when a report
was received at the Morgue and police
headquarters that he-was missing.- At the
Morgue the inquiry came as to whether
Deuss' body had been brought in, showing
quite evidently that his friends believe; he
is but waiting an opportunity to kill him
self. :â .â¢->--â¢''.-â¢.â '.' '-â 
Mrs. Olga Deuss, the poor, woman who,
in a moment of insanity, has wrecked the
life of her husband, taken her own life and
the lives of their, children, was 40 years
of age. The little girl, Gretchen, would
have been 8 years old to-morrow. Fredda,
the second girl, was only 5 years and 6
months old, and tiny little Carl was but
six months past two summers. . -
JEALOUSY THE CAUSE.
Friends of Deuss Declared That the
Wife Was Unjustly Suspicious
of Her Husband.: ---.'-. - - -
Statements made by the friends of Deus3
show that Mrs. Deuss was jealous of her
husband. She believed that he, within a ;
few weeks, had been paying marked at
tention to a young woman, but friends
assert that there was not the slightest
foundation for the suspicion. . This idea,
which for several weeks : haunted the
woman who sought relief in death and
took her children with her to the great be
yond, unsettled her mind and it is prob
able that when her brain was turned by the
most uncontrollable of passions she de
cided upon carrying into effect her fatal
project.
Henry F. Fricke, a grocer at Guerrero
and Nineteenth streets, who was with
Deuss for several hours yesterday morn
ing, said:
- "You can understand what the poor
man's feelings were when he. made the
horrible discovery. It was enough to
drive a man to the verge of desperation,
and it is no wonder that he wanted to put
an end to his life. This afternoon he had
calmed down somewhat, arid in my com
pany we went to the Morgue ; and then
made arrangements for the disposition of
the unfortunate woman and the children,
after which he went to the Valencia-street
Hotel, and .when I left him at 5 o'clock he
was in a better mood than he was during
the forenoon. Vie*
"The woman had no cause for the com
mission of the dreadful crime/ She was
insanely jealous, and all without cause.
His friends can show where he was every
evening when away from home. . . There
was not the slightest cause for Mrs. Deuss
to be jealous â¢of him. He was a devoted
husband, and loved his wife and children
as fondly as any man could. As to finan
cial trouble, there was nothing in that. It
was only yesterday that he told me . that
he had put an advertisement.in The Call,
that it had brought him three customers,
and that he felt pleased with the begin
ning of the week. ,
"Mrs. Deuss used to attend all the meet
ings of the Mission Turn Vereiri, of which
Deuss is the vice-president, and when he
was there she had every onportunity to
watch his actions. At the last meeting
she was there, and I noticed that there
was something in her demeanor that sat
isfied me that there was something wrong
with her mind." â¢
William Gerken, proprietor of the Va
lencia-street Hotel, said: "I have known
Mr. Deuss for several years and know that
he was passionately fond of his wife and
children and had rio thoughts for any other
.woman or women. : Why, when he went
home from his business his children would
tumble over one another in their endeavor
to be taken up by him. There never was
any trouble in the family, as there was
not any cause for it. This forenoon he was
in a terrible state of mind, and he would
no doubt have done. himself harm had. he
not been watched l by his ] friends. This
evening -he was very much calmer and
spent most . all the ; time weeping and
moaning. At about 6 o'clock he went out
with friends. .: ;. 'â¢-.-"" '::'â â¢
"Why did Mrs. Deuss commit the terri
ble crime? It was simply jealousy, and
she was unjustly jealous. ; Nothing but
jealousy drove her to it.".
One of Deuss' most -intimate friends is
Emil Leiss, speaker of the Independent
German Congregation and editor-in-chief
of the San Francisco Tageblatt. He was
in the company of his friend for several
hours yesterday afternoon.
"This is indeed sad,", said Mr. Liess last
night, "and nothing .but; unfounded
jealousy caused ; Mrs. Deuss to do what
she did. I have known the . family for a
long time. I know .that Deuss was ex
tremely fond of his wife and children, and
he was passionately fond of the poor little
boy. The loss ; of ; those 'he loved, and in
such a manner, was 'enough to I drive him
crazy and make him wish to go to those
he loved so well. â¢ :.-,f- vâ ; <1
"Several weeks ago Mrs. Deuss became
possessed of ' the idea - that her husband
was ; making ; love to a young woman, but
there was absolutely no cause for such an
idea.- Still it preyed upon her mind to
such an extent that it affected it, and last
Thursday when* ' I ; delivered . a lecture at
Turn :; Halle, in' the' Mission, â¢ Mrs. Deuss
was â  there, and I noticed that there was
something unusual the matter with her,
for she did not appear as usual. ' Despite
this , feeling which possessed her there was
} nothing â¢. that occurred in the family circle
to disturb its tranquillity.
â c "There is 'Ââ  no reason to believe; that
money matters had anything â to do with
the act, for j Mr. Deuss; provided well for
; his f family and ; never ; troubled â¢; bis wife
{ with his business affairs.
The Bodies of Mrs. Olga .Dsuss and Her Little Ones as They Appeared on the Slabs at the Morgue.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
"This morning Deuss made all prepara
tions to end his life. He went to his place
of business, took a number of watches that
had been left with him and returned them
to: their respective owners. - - His friends
prevented c him from carrying out his pur
pose, and after I had talked to him for
some time, he promised me upon his word
of honor that he will not end his life. He
declared that he had nothing to live for,
yet I believe he will keep his promise.
"During the ' afternoon he expressed a
desire that the bodies of his dead family
should be cremated, and in accordance
with his wish the bodies will be cremated
at 2 o'clock on Thursday afternoon at the
Odd Fellows' Cemetery."
At 9 o'clock last night Deuss returned to
the Valencia-street Hotel, and broken
hearted and tired out, he was taken to a
room and induced to retire. Before doing
so he frequently expressed the hope that
death would come to him, as there was no
further life or happiness for him in this
world. At last nature asserted herself and
he fell into, a slumber, and at midnight
was still sleeping. Two friends remained
in the room to watch him to see that he
did himself no harm should he awaken
again and be taken with the notion that
he ought to end his days.

-The Board of Health Will Take Ac-
tion on the Hog Hunches
To-Day.
At a special meeting of the Board of
Health to be held to-day the most impor
tant question to '. be discussed will be the
hog ranches which have caused so much
complaint among the residents of. the Bay.
View, Excelsior and Spring Valley home
steads. It is not improbable that some of
the most .odorous.and filthy of them will
be condemned as public nuisances and or
dered closed or removed. '- -.
'-.' The board partially decided to take this
action some time ago, but concluded to ask
the Supervisors to extend the hog limits
so as to include the tracts mentioned and
thus settle the matter.'flÃÃgWÃ*i*M
The Supervisors when the subject came
up for action failed to agree on a time
when .a regulation that was drawn up
should go into effect and the matter was
dropped, when a tie vote, at last Monday's
meeting, lost the friends of the protesting
property-owners the opportunity of mov
ing the ranches.
The members of the Board of Health
are unanimous in the belief that the
ranches are a nuisance and unless those
who conduct them can show some very
valid reason why action should be deferred
the law that gives the board the power to
condemn obnoxious habitations or â¢nui
sances will be called into play. v :

LOST HIS DIPLOMA.
Dr. W. F. Parke on Trial for Prac-
ticins .Without a Certificate.
-.' Dr. W. F. Parke of Oak and Franklin
streets appeared before Judge Joachim
sen yesterday to answer to the charge of
practicing medicine without a doctor's
certificate. v
The complaining witness, Mrs. Mary
Harkness of 120 Oak street, testified that
she consulted Dr. Parke as to her condi
tion and he treated her for cancer of the
stomach. The result was. that she gave
premature birth to a child and her health
had been greatly injured by Dr. Parke's
mistaken diagnosis of her case. Another
physician was called in. Dr. Wadsworth
of the State Board of Medical Examiners, _
and he found that Dr. Parke's name was
not on the list of registered practitioners.
In his own behalf Dr. Parke testified
that he was a graduate of the Philadelphia
Medical College, but unfortunately lost
his diploma in Denver some years ago.
He denied the allegations ; made by Mrs.
Harkness.
The Judge said he would take the case
under advisement. ,:
"CYCLE BOARD OF TRADE"
Special Meeting for Its Organization
Called by Local Dealers in
-s_-.~; -';-' "Wheels.
The following call for a meeting has been
issued by the leading bicye'e dealers of
the City: â¢â :'.'
San Francisco, Cal., March. 23,' 1896.
Deer Sir: The undersigned respectfully and
earnestly 'request your presence, or that I of
your authorized representative, at a meeting of
the bicycle dealers of San Francisco, to be. held
on Thursday evering, April 2, 7:30 o'clock
sharp, at the Rambler Blclcrama, Thomas H.
B. Varney, corner of Market and Tenth streets,
this City.
The object of this meeting , is to organize
what we may term "San Francisco Cycle Board
of Trade." the chief purpose of which is to se
cure good streets and in addition to adopt such
measures from time to time that will lessen
the liability of fraudulent or irresponsible
purchasers, lake advertising, schemers, etc.
â¢An association of the dealers, together with
the co-operation and indorsement of all wheel
men will, we believe, prove a powerful and in
fluential combination in agitating and de
manding, politically and otherwise, the paving
of our principal thoroughfares. Should these
results be accomplished they would" create an
impetus to the retail bicycle trade of incalcu
lable benefit to us as well.
: We sincerely trust you will realize the logic
of such procedure, and indorse the plan of or
ganization as outlined, by attending this meet
ing without fail.

P:o* Francisco; Cal Â« March 31. 1596.
:' To the Beard of. Directors, Manufacturers' and
Trodue Associationâ Gentlemen: The work
: . the association..; has been .engaged /in during
-the past under the control of the first
; board of directors has been fully outlined in
i:. first annual report of the. secretary which
has been submitted to all our members; inas
much as several plans for future work have
been left unfinished by the old "board, I deem
it my duty .to: call the attention of the new
. board to them. â -â  â 
. . â¢ The most important unfinished -work is that
,of malting arrangements for "holding of an
exposition of home products-. : . Owing to our
inability to secure the Mechanics' PavUHon for
-that purpose, and the great expense involved
in erecting a special. building, the old board
have felt disinclined to take any definite steps
in the matter. I am advised, "however, that
â¢ginee the election of a new board of directors
;;of the Mechanics' Institute, it is believed that
if. the matter was brought before them again
some arrangements Could be made by which
\ the two associations could combine in "holding
.an exposition of California products at the Pa
:vilion in the fall of this year. 1 would, there
fore, suggest that a: conference committee be
appointed for that purpose.
...The matter of the organization of "home
-products*.' clubs throughout the State has pro
gressed to that point where we can now com
' mence the work by organizing Club No. 1 it*
Oakland and Club No. 2 in Uakersfield, but it
remains for your board to authorize the' work
to be done. I have compiled a constitution
end by-laws suitable for such organizations,
and inasmuch as this association has been in
. vite! to send a delegation to Bafcersfield April
11 for the purpose of taking up the work there,
1 would suggest that your board appoint a spe
cial committee to pass upou the by-laws and
authorize the formation of these clubs. I beg
also to suggest that you appoint as a special
member oi this committee Mrs. IT. O. Trow
bridge of the Ebel Society of Oakland, through
whom we expect to inaugurate the work in
Alameda County, It will also be necessary to
appoint a delegation to proceed to Biikersneld
April 11, if it is. decided to organize a club
: there.- â¢ .
' Among other unfinished business is that of
the revision of the hy-laws of the association,
the change in the board of directors causing a
Vacancy in the committee having the matter in
charge.
The adoption of a trademark to be used on
[ Ca.ifornia-uade . goods by members of this
r association has been frequently referred to,
has often been called lor, and was again spoken
*â : at our Annual meeting. It is believed by a
large number of persons that the Interests of
our members will be advanced and protected
by the use of a trademark, and I would there
fore suggest that the matter be taken up.
Another important subject referred to in the
secretary's annual report, and not vet acted
upon, is the introduction of textbook's in the
public schools for the education of the chil- I
dren in the advantages to be gained in the de
velopment of the natural resources of the
State and in patronizing home industries.
I would also beg leave to call your attention j
to the fact that a few months ago this associa
tion called the attention of Governor James i
Budd to the large importation ot prison-made
goods into this State, aud requested him to
t.JtffijJ.lr'S'KlTi Eri^Ttrrief^tr^rSs t. and inves
tigate the subject. We were assured, unoffi
cially, that our request would be complied
â with, but we have been recently advised that
the investigation has not yet been undertaken.
As It is a matter of such vital importance to
our manufacturers, this association should
take action upon it. Respectfully submitted,
B. H. Tacy, Manager.
Mr. Tacy report was accepted and its
recommendations considered seriatim. It
was decided to accept the invitation from
Bakersfield and send two delegates to that
town, the delegates to be named at some
date in the near future. Mr. Crocker
ordered the secretary to write to Bakers
field accepting the invitation, and mean
while to rind two members willing to re
spond thereto, their expenses to be paid
by the association.
; Messrs. Mead, Currier, Crocker, Sbar
boro and Mrs. Trowbridge were appointed
a committee to draw up by-laws for clubs
desirous of acting as auxiliaries to the
association.
The matter of the adoption of a trade
mark was deferred until a larger number
of members were present.
= The proposed exposition of home prod
ucts then came up for discussion.
Mr. Mead suggested that a committee
be appointed for the purpose of attending
to the matter, and that the Mechanics'
Institute be notified of the appointment.
In view of the recent friction between, the
two organizations regarding the exposi
tion he was not in favor of the committee
visiting the institute.
"But we ought to meet them half-way,"
interposed Mr. Crocker mildly. .
"No, we ought not." rejoined Mead
hotly; "we remember what haDpened be
fore, and a burned child dreads the tire.''
However, Messrs. Sbarboro, McLaughlin
and Kerr, all being members of the Me
chanics' Institute, as well as pillars of the
Merchants' Association, were appointed
on the committee and promised to do
their best to prevent future misunder
standings.
The secretary was ordered to write to
his Excellency, the Governor, requesting
information as to the importation of con
vict-made goods into the State. He re
ported that he had already written to
Washington 'for information on the mat
ter, but as yet had received no reply.
Among the communications was one
from Miss Kate E. Whitaker, the cooking-
Echool authority, calling attention to an
article on California En an Eastern paper.
Miss Whitaker's first dealings with the
association commenced when she found
her name used as indorsing an Eastern
brand of yeast powder, and requested that
body to withdraw the forged indorsement.
Another communication, from Mrs.
Margaret Touchard, was ordered placed
on file. Mrs. Touchard was the moving
Epirit in the "Californian banquet," given
on the 16th of October last at the Cali
fornia Hotel. In her letter she said she
had taken three months in which to pre
pare for the banquet, but that it had not
been properly supported, and she had been
unable to meet the bills. Being threat
ened with suits at law she asked some
financial aid from the association.
Mr. Mead "said Mrs. Touchard had no
reason to ask the association' to foot the
bills.
"That's what I told her,", remarked Mr.
Crocker; "I was president of : the Half
Million Club at the time, and i warned
ber that the thing wouldn't pay."
"But I paid," interposed Mr. Sbarboro.
"I paid two good dollars for my share in
the banquet and went away unsatisfied.
There was an elaborate menu, but very
more."
'-* We had better assure Mrs. Touchard
that, whatever we may do as individuals,
the cannot expect one cent from the asso
ciation as such," recommended Mr.' Mead,
and thus the matter rested.
Messrs. Davis, Mead and Bowers were
appointed a committee on ways and
means, and the members 'were about to
proceed to the appointment of an execu
tive . committee when Mr. Crocker* pro
tested. â¢â '.â -.
"It seems to me," he said, "that we are
becoming just a little rapid in" this thing
of appointing committees.. '.We had better,
wait until the president is present and we
have a lareer attendance of members, ".-'"j.
Mr. Crocker's view* was "vigorously cop

Each succeeding meeting of the City
Hall Commission for several weeks past
has been more stormy than the preceding"
one, and violent language has been re
sorted to by the members on several : occa
sions, but the climax was reached yester
day.
The cause of the trouble was the pro
posed City Hall directory which the Mer
chants' Association desires put in'./! A
communication was received from the as
sociation relative to the matter, and Mr.
Creswell moved that it be placed on'
file. , , ; ;
Mayor Sutro opposed such action on ; the
ground that it would be discourteous, and
mentioned the fact that the project of hav
ing a directory had been broached several
months ago. . o , *;Â« " â ''
Auditor Broderick intimated ; that the
directory mentioned had been intended as
a job. out of which some one was to make
$1000. â¢ . i"?.Â°Â°< â 
"Who had a job? You?" inquired the
Mayor.
'â¢No, you," shouted Broderick, "and a
man whom you said you paid out of your
own pocket." ; "
"This action on this communication is
discourteous," declared the Mayor. 'â¢);. : \: )

â¢â¢If you don't like it make a plan that
will suit you," said the Mayor.
"That "is exactly what we intend to do,"
said Creswell. . .
"I would like to know what the secret of
this opposition is. Is there anything be
hind the scenes?" demanded the Mayor.
"There may be in your office," replied
Broderick. - t
"1 want an explanation," shouted the
Mayor. "I have never had one. There is
some secret behind all this. You haven't
given any reason."
"The only plan yet suggested," said
Broderick, "was the one put before this
board by you, and I denounced it as a job
and a scheme." W**BM*iJSBBsS^B&
"There was a time," said Mr. Creswell,
very deliberately, 'when people were in
dicted for being common scolds, and it is a
pity that such a law is not in force now."
"There is a ring in this hall, and I be
lieve you belong to it," declared the Mayor.
"If you were not a fit subject for an in
sane asylum," said Creswell, "utterly
irresponsible and twenty years older than
I, I would-"
"It's the work of that scoundrel Hunt
ington and the oc'opus. The City Hall is
full of boodlers. You can't bully me."
"No one desires to."
"I am a square and honest man," said
the Mayor.':gMs9o6!"TC9B
"The Sutro tunnel job proved that," re
torted Creswell.
"It's a lieâ a dirty lie shouted the
Mayor. "Tnat was all the work of Hunt
ington and his hirelings. It is a*- â lie."
Both Mr. Creswell and Mr. Broderick
took turns baiting the -Mayor until all
were at a white heat and talking at the
top of their lungs. When exhaustion
compelled them to call a halt Mr. Cres
well submitted the,' following - resolution,
which was adopted on the votes of Brod
erick and Creswell: " v
Resolved, That the Merchants' Association
or other association, corporation, : person or
persons having any plan of directories for
large buildings .be requested to submit the
same to the new City Hall Commissioners at
an early date. The commission having had
the question of a directory under considera
tion for some time will be pleased, in open
board, to receive suggestions from any one In
regard thereto, so that the Commissioners
might be advised of the different plans suit
able to the new City Hall before making a
selection. -
Architect Shea then submitted plans
and specifications for the new roof that is
to complete the building. He estimated
the cost at $300,000.
: It was decided to advertise for bids for
the work for thirty-five 'days and require
the successful competitor to finish the
roof by the first day of January" next.
The plans show tnat it is proposed to re
move the entire wooden roof and substi
tute one ; of steel. Architect Shea desig
nated the proposed structure as a hip-roof,
and explained that there would be an at
tic under, it fifteen feet in height. The
roof is to be surmounted by : a deck all
around the building, eight feet in width,
with patent sidewalk lights for the illumi
nation of the interior. The slanting sides
will be incased iin terra cotta, covered by
California slate. The roof plans also con
tain provision i; for , a ; system of . ventila
tion for the entire building. The dome
plans provide for. a mosaic floor on the
first story and .' marble floor above. :â  The
walls of the first floor are to be wainscoted
to a' height of twelve feet; with California
marble, and on the upper floors the marble
will be six feet in height. There is a cir
cular shaft thirty feet in diameter on one
side of \ the " dome "in which ' will be H con
structed a staircase running to the top >of
the dome. Provision is also made for an
elevator-shaft and an = inner/dome' of art
glass rising above the th rd floor. '"This
inner dome," said Shea, "will be a novelty.
It will be sixty-five feet in diameterâ the
largest art glass dome in the country."

He is one of the leading owners in the

now being j opened .-up. There is a five
stamp mill on it, arid hve more stamps are
to be erected now, .while a large mill will
be built later.'.The ex-Governor says the
proDerty has a large body of low-grade ore:
.-. "It is not very active : in a mining way
immediately at Dutch' Flat," continued
he, "but over about Humbug,' Blue Can-,
yon and ' Damascus 'it is ' pretty lively.
There are from 200 to . 300 -men at Work.
The country is very promising.
"The most activity is on the Pioneer.
This property was bought some months
ago by Boston people for $160,000. A. E.
Davis of this City, Senator Fair's old part
ner in the Santa Cruz road, was one of the
owners. .
.. "The Boston people started the mine,
issuing 100,000 shares of a par value of $1
each. They also went to work developing
the property. They succeeded so well that
in February they took out $17,500 in gold.
They have done fully as well in March, so
Mr. Sullivan, the manager, told me the
other day.
"The result has been so satisfactory that
the shares have gone up to $8 a share and
upward, making the valuation of the mine
from $800,000 to $1,000,000.

\ Recently the Board or Supervisors

to round them up. He went into the Pal

matter of extending the belt railroad from
its present terminus .- to the Mail Dock.
Sneath strongly advocated the building of
the road and said that for the. want of it
San Francisco's imports by sea had not
increased" for four a years. According vto
him' all the profits are eaten up by cartage
< bills, and it is cheaper to move goods to;
Port Costa than! to"; the Southern Pacific
depot. He - said . that for want of a belt
road ' manufacturers . were moving to
Stockton, Antioch and Port Costa because
there they could secure better facilities. : !

relief asked Commissioner Chadbourne.
"Extend the belt road south to the Mail
dock and bring the railroad and shipping
together," was the answer. '}â â 'â ::
It was pointed out that there was no ap
propriation with which to extend the sea
â¢ wall, and until that was done the belt road
could not be built. . - r '.
/ Sneath suggested the building of the
road on piles, but Chief Engineer Holmes
said such an' idea was impracticable, as
there would be no place for switches and
no yards. '' '
Captain* Merry said it' was absolutely
necessary to bring the shipping and the
railroads together. \lf ' this was done mil
lions would be saved to the mercantile
community every year. Hugh Craig said
that there would be no difficulty in build
ing the remaining 3200 feet of road north
of Market, and the only difficulty would
be the 4800 feet from Market street south to
the Mail dock. "If," said, he, "the board
has not the money, the Chamber of Com
merce will undertake to raise it."
Sal It was ; finally decided to allow Chief
Engineer Holmes to make out a list of the
difficulties. in the way of extending the
road and the Chamber of Commerce will
point out the manner" in which they can
be overcome if possible. .!.-.

ST. DENIS AGREES
WITH STRIKERS.

ENDED BY ARBITRATION
Painters Agree to a Proposition
Recommended by a Com
mittee. â¢ .
THE WORK OF THE COUNCIL.
Building Trades Working-Card to Be
Enforced To-Dayâ A. Genei al ..'
â Strike Not Possible. .;
The painters' strike is ending in a vic
tory for the men. :
This was accomplished through the inter
vention of the Building Trades Council,
whose grievance committee, acting in the
capacity of arbitrators, brought together
the Painters' Union and one of the largest
employing paint firms, and arranged a
settlement of their differences.
When the striking painters had carried
their fight as far as they could they trans
ferred the burden to the shoulders of the
council with which it is affiliated. Mr.
Saunders and Mr. McCartney of th*
grievance committee set to work to bring
about a peace between the warring ele
ments if possible.
They decided that to deal with the
Master Painters' Association as a body
would be fruitless, so they went to St. Denis
& Co., one of the largest firms in the . em
ploying business, and several conferences
were held with Mr. St. Denis and his part
ner, Mr. Macauley, who, to the surprise of
the committeemen, were not so difficult to
deal with as was supposed. At the last
meeting, held yesterday afternoon, St.
Denis & Co. made a proposition which was
indorsed by the arbitrating committee and
later accepted by the union.
This unionizes one of the largest shops
in the City, and raises a cloud from the
big Parrott building where several hun
dred union men will be at work within
twenty-four hours. 'â ;'*'..:
From reliable sources it is learned that
other big contracting paint firms will be
willing to compromise their troubles on
the same terms.
This incident in the strike, which was
the largest since . the molders' strike,
bears out the prediction made by The Call
months ago, that the Building Trades
Council would act as an arbitrator in all
labor troubles, and that its mission was
not to create trouble and instigate strikes,
walkouts and boycotts.
The benefit to the Painters' Union which
will be held in the Bush-street Theater to
night promises to be a grand success. One
of the attractions will bÂ« Miss M. Wells of
the Bacon Stock Company of Oakland.
To-day the Building Trades Council's
working-card sytem will go into effect.
No general strike will be ordered, al
though a few jobs may be strucK.
The building trades unions held a mass
meeting last * veiling at 115 Turk street to
discuss the card system.
MET IN CONFERENCE.
Many Important Points Agreed
Upon by St. Denis and the Labor
'â . ; -y Union's Representatives.
One of the most important conferences
between representatives of the painters'
union and employing painters was held
yesterday afternoon in the office of J. St.
Denis it Co. on Sutter street, near Grant
avenue. The object of the meeting was
explained in yesterday's Callâ to effect a
settlement, if possible, between the
Painters' Union and the master painters.
As stated, the strike has been virtually
thrown upon the Building Trades Coun
cil, of which the Painters' Union is a mem
ber. . Saunders and McCartney of the
grievance committee of the council went
to St. Denis ,and his partner, Macauley,
and expressed the wish that the strike
against this firm be settled without further
trouble and before the council's working
card system should go into effect on the Ist.
Both painters expressed similar wishes
and it was arranged that a conference
should be held on the following afternoon,
yesterday, at which all interested parties
should be represented. EsgESgggÂ£|^riS|39
At the gathering yesterday were Mr. St.
Denis and his partner, Mr. Macauley, Mr.
Saunders and Mr. McCartney representing
the Building Trades Council and Mr.
Ames and Mr. Shields representing the
Painters' Union. President Rose of the
latter body was present, but he was only
an ex-officio member of the committee.
After a little conversation, relative to the
strike and the causes Mr. Macauley pre
sented the outline of a compact his firm
was ready to enter into with the Painters'
Union.
In the main points he agreed to accede
to the union's 'demands. The first hitch
was with regard to the number* of men to
each foreman, St. Denis asking for one
foreman to eight men, while the. union
asked for one foreman for ten. Another
point for argument was the " apprentices,
the firm wanting one apprentice to six
men. The firm's concessions were modi
fied and altered until they read as follows:
Firstâ That J. St. Denis A. Co. recognize the
working-card system -as now understood,
namely, that the applicant is a member of the
Painters' Union.
Secondâ That &.1 per day shall be the ruling
rate of wages for eight hours' work. - -
Thirdâ one foreman be conceded by
the Painters' Union to each eight journeymen
employed in the shop; said foreman to-be un
der the control of the shop and not necessarily
a member of the union.
Fourthâ That one apprentice be conceded
by the Painters* Union' to every ten journey
men, and that one improver (laborer) be con
ceded to each eight journeymen. ;
Fifthâ That the non-union men at present
employed in the shop be admitted to member
ship in the Painters* Union without prejudice'
that is, that their, initiation fee shall be no
more than the original fee. This concession is
asked Irom the fact that the men at the re
quest of the shop refrained from joining the
union.
Sixthâ That; the ruling rate of "wages for
paper-hangers (shall be .*3 50 for eight hours'
work.
The worst hitch in the projected settle
ment was the clause referring to the ad
mission of. St. Denis' non-union^ men, into
the union at the fee that was charged be
fore the second call-out by the union. Be
fore then the fee was 25 cents, but a week
,ago it was raised to $10. â  \
. Mr. Macauley explained that about
eighteen of his old men wanted to join the
union when the * strike began"; but he in
duced them to remain with-; the shop.
"While he had given in to so much he be
lieved that in the interests of peace and an
amicable: settlement these men should be
regarded the same as though their applica
tions had been presented at the time. /.-:';'
Mr. St. Denis added to this by saying
that it was only in behalf of * the eighteen
old shophands that he and Mr. Macauley
spoke. The other forty or fifty. non-union
men at work for them on the Parrott build
ing may look out for themselves.
::':" Mr.: Shields,; for the Painters' ' Union,
said that: lie feared that the union would
be loth.to concede this point, particularly
as a number of applicants have paid $10
initiation fees since the: order went into
effect. . Besides, any concession made to
St. Denis & Co. would have to be made to
any other firm of painters in the City.
"Well, I'll tell, you what we will do,"
said Macauley. "The firm will pay an
initiation fee of $2 50 for each of tne eight
een men we want to retain. We will
see that* they pay $1 50 each, . which will
make - the initiation fee ; $4. ' It seems
to me that your union should meet us part
way. We have granted every request yon
ask* involvine the : principles of union-sm
and you ought to be able to afford us a
little relief in the matter of fee where it is
nothing out of your pockets and it is a
great deal out of burs."
Each committee promised to report the
matter to its respective body and give' the
firm an answer as speedily as possible.
THE MASS-MEETING.
Gathering of the Building Trades to
Discuss the Working-Card
System.
There was a mass-meeting of the mem
bers of the various unions in the Building
Trades Council held last evening in the
Temple at 11"* Turk street.' The purpose
was to explain the aims, objects and pur
poses of the system to those who did not
thoroughly understand them. The fact
that there was a number of vacant seats
led to the belief that the card and its
meaning is pretty well understood. As a
fact it should be, for it has been the theme
of discussion in every union affiliated with
the council since its acceptance several
months ago.
Henry: Meyer of Carpenters' Union 22
opened the meeting and stated the object
of the gathering. He said that the Build
ing Trades Council is now the strongest
labor organization ever existing in this
City. He said he wanted to enlighten the
public as to the meaning of the term labor
agitators. The opinion of many is that
this class of human beings are not" repre
sentatives of the trades. All of those
who are now prominent in trades unions
and labor organizations, are good workmen
and those who speak at the meetings are
hard-working craftsmen.. The chairman
urged till union men to be moderate but
firm in enforcing the card system, and to
do all in their power to induce non-union
men to join the union and to respect and
act upon all cases where moral suasion
will not avail.
EL T. Mclvor of the Painters' Union
explained the working card, and said:
All the card consists of is a small piece of
paperâ a certificate that the bearer is a mem
ber of a certain union. Before proceeding 1
wish to speak of a trip I made to the City Hall.
I inspected the tower ana found. a lot of rusty
iron supporting the immense dome and a lot
of laborers, not 'painters, daubing some
kind of stuff, not paintâ l don't know
what 'it was â on this iron. It is the
time now for the workmen ot the City
to look into these matters. This is an im
portant matter, because thousands of dollars
of the people's money is being spent for rotten
work and poor workmen in the construction
of a monument that should be a credit instead
of a disgrace to the City. The job is rotten
from basement to domeâ as rotten as the men
who are running the City's affairs and con
structing the building. *
Referring to the card again he said that
the objects are to bring together for mu
tual protection those who will not help
themselves and therefore fall easily into
the clutches of the employers, whose in
terests are not the interests of the
laboring man. Thus the union labor
ers must band themselves together to
maintain their rights as against those
who are willing to receive the benefits but
are not willing to share in the toils that
are necessary to secure the fruits of organ
ized labor. 'The speaker urged those who
are in tradts unions to go out
and organize those who are not.
The workingmen ail over the coast are
only too anxious to form into unions. By
the end of this year he expects to have all
California organized better than ever be
fore. Mr. Mclvor said that he does not
expect that the introduction of the card
system will be productive of any trouble.
P. Boss Martin was the next speaker
and he was enthusiastically received. He
began his discourse by referring to a body
of men on Battery and Market streets who
were excavating for the foundation of a
building who were receiving only 85 cents
a day: "Why don't they organize?" was
the question and this formed the text of
the speaker's discourse.
As to the working-card the speaker said
that the card is only the workingman's
trademark. It represents what he has to
sellâ his labor, it is to his interest that
his goods should not be adulterated, as it
is by those who are designated as "Scabs."
Men depreciate the value of labor by mak
ing it cheaper. Mr. Martin for a time lost
track of the object of the meeting, the card
system, by discoursing upon matters of
political economy.
P. 11. McCarthy of Carpenters' Union
No. 22 went directly to the point and said :
To-morrow morning, April 1. all union men
finding non-union men at work on a job must
notify the boss that either the man must send
in his application for membership in the union
of his craft or the union man will walk out of
his job. The boss will not keep a non-union
man rive minutes if he thinks that all the
union craftsmen will walk out.
Mr. McCarthy made a strong appeal to
the assembly .to enter politics as union
men.
W. H. Hutchinson, treasurer of Carpen
ters' Union .483, went into the history of
the working - card system and said
that he was one of the first to dis
cuss the system at a time when the
labor unions werejvery low. After discuss
ing the system in the several unions, it
was decided to put it into effect and at
last it was adopted by the building trades
of this City. He urged' every union man
to assist the . business agent by enforcing
the provisions of the curd on every job in
San Francisco.
C. F. Schadt of Carpenters' Union No.
483 said that he had just returned from a
meeting with the French and Italian Car
penter^ Union.- He heard a report read
to the effect that every French and Italian
contractor had given in to the eight-hour
a-day system. The men of that union are
very enthusiastic in the cause of union
ism. He i;poke at length upon the neces
sity of educating the working classes, not
in "book learning," but' upon their rights
as citizens and as workingmen and the ne
cessity of organizing trades unions.
IT WAS SATISFACTORY.
The Painters' Union Has Accepted
the Proposition Made by St. ".'â ';..
Denis & Co.
The Painters' Union assembled early
last evening in the Temple to hear the re
port of the conference of the committees
with St. Denis & Co. The interest was in
tense. Messrs. Saunders and McCarthy,
representing the building trades, were
present. They presented a report of what
had taken place, at the "meeting with Mr.
St. Denis and Mr: Macauley and the propo
sition presented by the latter, which, ap

The representatives of the council recom
mended "that the proposition be accepted

Mr. Ames " and â Mr. Shields, who repre
sented the Painters' Union, stated that
the proposition was the best that could be
obtained and there was no use quibbling
about the initiation fee, even if it became
necessary to alter the previous acts 'of ', the
union * upon ' that ' point. ;. ;: A few wanted

the same terms as St. Denis & Co.
THE WORKING CARD.
It Will Be Enforced To-Day and
Several Mixed Jobs Will Prob
ably Be Struck.
â¢ The building trades' working-card sys
tem goes into effect this morning. A gen
eral' strike is almost impossible, but the
union workmen, may be called off several
jobs where non-union men are known to
be at work. All of the contractors in the
City and nearly every union man under
stands the meaning of the card. Every
union man must be provided with a card
furnished by the Building Trades Coun
cil, and he must enforce the rate of wages
demanded by his organization and not
work more than eight hours.
The 'council recently appointed two
business agents or walking delegates, who
will see that the provisions of the card are
enforced. The agents are R. T. Mclvor of
the Painters' Union and 11. M. Saunders
of the Carpenters' Unions.
There are several mixed jobs in this
City which the delegates will visit the
first thing in the morning. One is on
Market and First streets, where there is
a gang of non-union lathers. A similar
job on Post and Larkin streets will be vis
ited. These Dlaces were, "struck" when
the lathers' strike was, begun three weeks
ago. Unless the bosses recognize the card
all the union men will be "called out at
once. ' : : v ''s";'-;-'"-,*X^;;-
It is believed that all of, the othei
"mixed" jobs will be straigthened out
without trouble either by the discharge of
the non-union workmen or the latter
joining the union of their trade. â¢ ' |
LATHERS TO STRIKE.
The Plasterers Will Give Them the
Wages Demanded and All will
Be Harmonious.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 31.â President
Louis Hemphill of the Lathers' Union and
Secretary Charles Van Haltren have issued
orders for a general strike of the lathers in
Oakland, to take place to-morrow morning.
The Lathers' Union has been unable to
sustain prices owing to its unemployed
members taking jobs under union, prices.
They now demand $2 per 1000, which will
be readily granted by the plasterers, who
think it only a just demand. However,
they would like to see the men stay with
the prices they set. They are only getting
75 cents and $1 now by their own acts.
A. C. McTavish, one of the most promi
nent plasterers of^the city, said to-night:
"The lathers will go on one of their regu
lar strikes to-morrow, but it will not
amount to much. The plasterers will
give them the wages demanded and work
will go on just as usual."
THE BAKERIES.
Inspectors Grassmann and Postler
Find Many That Are
Dirty.
Special Inspectors Grassmann and Post
ler, who have been assigned to investigate
the condition of the bakeries of this City,
were out on a tour last night.
"We visited six bakeries to-night," said
Inspector Grassmann, "and ten the night
before, making sixteen to date. In all but
one instance we found them in bad con
dition, In fact dirty. In one place to-night
in the southern part of the City we in
vestigated a bakery that is run by a man
who employs what are termed general
workmen. He has six of them, and pays
them $2 a week. The men sleep in the
bakeshop, which is without ventilation.
"We will continue this inquiry from
night to night until our work is done, and
that will take about three weeks. Every
week we shall make a report to the Labor
Commissioner, and when oar work is
ended we shall make a full report giving
all the details of our wotk."
The deputies are preparing: a report
which will be turned in at the headquar
ters of the commission on Saturday. *
"Those who persist in denying admis
sion to the deputies will be arrested," said
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald yesterday.
"What they want is time to clean up be
fore the deputies get into their dens. To
night the places which were closed to them
will be visited again, and in all probability
the deputies will find everything in good
order. A strict record, however, is being
kept, and the bakeshops whose proprietors
now seem to fear a visit will be closely
watched."
MUSIC FIT FOR LENT
i' â 
Gounod's "Redemption" Per
formed by the Local Ora
torio Society.
Many Church Members Gather in
Metropolitan Temple to Hear
the Oratorio.
Gounod's "Redemption" was given for
the first time in San Francisco with or
chestral accompaniment by.the San Fran
cisco Oratorio Society and the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra last! night in
Metropolitan Temple. There was a large
audience present, among which were many
prominent clergymen and church mem
bers. 'â  ..... '
The ''Redemption" was a very ambi
tious departure for a choral society which
is not yet a year old, and on the whole its
rendering reflected credit on the perform
ers. >.yÂ£
The choruses were not all on the same
plane of meritâ some of them, particu
larly those which gave scope lor clashing
forte passages, went with a good swing,
others were a .little : uncertain. / Shading
was not attempted, but finished shading
seldom comes to choruses without long
experience. '- . ' -
; A number of cuts were made in the
score, particularly in its orchestral por
tions. The San Francisco Symphony^
Orchestra was not so well representea last
night as it generally is ] at the symphony
concerts.* and the audience did not miss so
much from the cuts as it might have done.
The most interesting number was the
soprano solo < and - chorus, "From 'â . thy
love as a father,',' in which Mme. Yda de
Seniinario sang the soprano solo with
charming grace and effect, taking the high
C with the utmost ease.v The chorus also
did good work in this number. The audi
ence insisted on the number being re
peated. .
The chorus and solo, "Unfold, ye por
tals," aroused considerable . ; applause.
Both the male choruses, "Can he not save
himself and "Christ is risen again," were
well sung. James Hamilton "Howe was
the conductor.
Of the soloists Mine, de Seminario and
George McÃride distinguished themselves
most. The former did not show any spe
cial ability for ? recitation, but \ she has a
mellow, ringing voice and sang her arias
well. George McÃride is gifted with.' a
voice of such extended possibilities that

DE YOUNG ON THE STAND
The Court Protects Him on the
Circulation Ques
tion.
CALLED; IN LANDON'S CASE.
Sharp Cross-Questioning of. the Plain
tiff and Interchange Between
Attorneys.
The trial of the case of Gardner Landon
against the Tallant Banking Company be
fore Judge Hunt, to recover $50,000 for al
leged malicious persecution, worked itself
around yesterday until it wore the appear
ance of a boomerang.
Landon was on the stand nearly all day
undergoing first the direct examination at
the hands of his attorney, G. "W. Monteith,
and then a long and scorching cross-exam
ination by W. W. Poote. During the cross
examination a casual visitor to the court
room might .have supposed that Landon
was the defendant in a criminal case. The
grounds upon which the indictments were
found, which Landon complains of, were
all gone over and he was asked to explain
many things in connection with the dis
counted notes that he confessed he could
not make clear.
All the day long until the last thing
before adjournment M. 11. de Young, pro
prietor, and John P. Young, managing
editor of the Chronicle, sat in the witness
room waiting to be called to explain the
animus of several news stories published
in the Chronicle in April, 1893 and 1894,
relating to Landon and the indictments;
and all the time Reuben Lloyd sat quietly
at one side in the courtroom amusing him
self by making sketches and caricatures of
the principals to the trial and incidentally
watching its course in the, interest of Mr.
de Young. *:
All the afternoon Attorney Monteith
was employed in making -objection to the
embarrassing line of questions which were
being fired at his client by Mr. Foote,
which objections were almost without ex
ception overruled. Indeed, the court it
self took a hand at asking embarrassing
questions just before tho noon recess and
when he was through, Mr. -Monteith filed
objections to these on â¢ the ground that
they, were irrelevant and incompetent and
also as to the manner of the. questioning,
which he declared was calculated to in
fluence the minds of the jury:* The court
refused to rule upon the objections.
When Mr. de Young was finally called
to testify, there was a good deal of wander
ing among paths not altogether familiar to
the attorney questioner, 1 * Monteith.
Several articles had T been published in
the Chronicle telling the story of the in
dictments against Landon. These publi
cations, it is claimed, were responsible to
a great degree in .bringing tne -sickness
from mental distress upon Landon, which
forms the basis for the claim for damages.
Mr. Monteith asked Mr. de Young if he
is proprietor of the Chronicle, and he
confessed that he is. â He could not tell
who wrote the article complained of. The
"detail" books for the date under consid
eration were called for and ". produced.
They had no record of the articles.
Tnen Mr. Monteith wanted to know
what record was kept of the income of the
Chronicle in such matters, and he said the
income was a matter of the business and
not the news department, and declared he
was being questioned about things of which
he had no personal knowledge at best.
The city editor at the time of the publi
cation Was the man to say who wrote the
articles. If any man : connected with. the
Chronicle received anything for the publi
cation he was not aware of itâthere was no
record of it. '
Then Mr. Monteithâ in order to show,
he said, how the publication complained
of had injured his clientâ asked the witness
as to the circulation of the Chronicleâ how
great it was on the days in question. >
Here Mr. Foote interfered, saying that
they had not contested the statoment
either that the articles in question had
been printed in the Chronicle or that the
Chronicle had , a wide circulation as
charged. He objected ; to bringing news
paper controversies into court. He also
charged Montieth with employing the case
to drag before the public extraneous mat
ters for ulterior motives. Everything in
this line material to the case had been ad
mitted.
â¢ So Mr. de Young was allowed to go ,and
John P. Young, managing editor, yvas
called. He could tell no more about the
articles as to who wrote|them, and hef too,
stepped down without any of tne revela
tions being made which Mr. Montieth de
pended upon.
The proceedings of the day had been be
gun by London, under examination, testi
fying that he had been caused great men
tal distress by.the indictments secured by
the faliant Banking Company and by the
publications referred to. Mr.'Foote began
his cross-examination by a careful inquiry
after his health at the present time. The
witness confessed that he was fairly well.
Then Foote wanted to know if he had
not been indicted shortly thereafter by the
United States Grand Jury for using the
mails to conduct a ; lottery scheme known
as a suit club.
The witness confessed to this, but said
that that indictment had also been: dis
missed upon his simple, promise to dis
continue the suit-club business. ;
Then Foote wanted to know if there had
not been a shortage of some $14,000, which
he had to - make good to the Vermont
Marble Company, after his some-time con
nection with it. ; *^"Jsa**Bllii3iÂ£feÃl3B&
The witness explained that there was
some difference between himself, and- the
company, by which he was required to
turn over $4000 in cash and an insurance
policy for $10,000. ,
After a further inquiry into the status of
the suit club, by which it was learned that
at the sudden suspension of business there
were many holders of tickets who were en
tirely out and injured, Mr. Foote came
down to the five notes upon which the five
indictments had been secured. The notes
were t those of tailors and sailorsâ -people
unknown in the business worldâ but their
notes were discounted at theTallant Bank,
Mr. Foote explained, because of -the confi
dence felt in the Mutual Oil Company, one
of its customers who introduced them, and
of which company Landon was one of the
principal figures. " '
The witness explained, 'in regard to one
of these notes, that it had been filled in by
the ; president, Mr. ' Blank, for : $300, while
the indebtedness of. the; maker, or signer
of the note, never amounted to more than
$50 to the company.'! : > .
Â« It was aboutthis transaction that Judge
Hunt asked the witness .a number of
pointed questions, as i to / : whether :, he
thought it a legitimate business transac
tion, to fill in a note for? six or seven times
the amount of j the indebtedness of the in
dividual whose name was attached. 9 â¢'â :.'.
: The witness said' that he thought it was
simply a matter of accommodation. ;.;
The court asked him if he thought'; that
was an answer to the question, and the
witness; said he could -give; no better an
swer. ;v \ y ."'...'' â¢â¢'-'â 
It was to these questions that Monteith
took exception. .;'.' .. ;
â¢hV Attorney Foote took up the 7 inquiry to
learn â ;â¢ if "there was ">. not an agreement be
tween Landon and Monteith to divide the
$50,000 which they hoped to secure as dam
ages. ~.2Â°.[.-;- â '/-'â . y ..--.- â â  y '--.'' *:y. ',y\ yy
â¢When â :â  this had been ruled out, Foote
offered to introduce evidence to* show that
the five notes; on which Landon had been
indicted were only a small part of & the
losses suffered in the same .way .by, the Tal
lant * 'Bank an! which footed up some
$30,000
' The court advised him to stick to his
five notes, as they formed the basis of the
suit. * ' ' -' â¢ t~'"
.Then Foote wanted to know, if it was not.
a fact that there was a regular conspiracy
between Landon and Blank, the president
of the oil : company,, to 10b the Tallant
bank. Â, * " *-* **
.The witness said there was not.
Foote wanted â â  to know if Landon had
not quarreled with Blank because , the
latter had ' succeeded in robbing the bank
of more than he (Landon) had.
Landon, probably inadvertently, : ad
mitted that they,; had quarreled on that
account â causing "quite a little sensation
in the courtroom.
The proceedings of the day, were inter
rupted by an almost 'constant crossfire be
tween the attorneys. M onteith, ' for in
stance, protested against the prolongation
of the cross-examination.
, "Time was made for slaves," said Foote,
"hut 1 do not wonder that you are weary,
my friend." ;
The witness declared that Foote did not
understand business methods.
"Don't you know that I have been en
gaged |in the practice of criminal law for
the last twenty-five years?" said Foote.
' "Yes."' - â â  "
"Then you must see that I understand
your business.''
Again Monteith said something in an
undertone to Foote and Foote in any
thing but an undertone declared :â 
"Mr. Monteith, you must treat me with
ordinary courtesy or I'll make you."
At this the court interrupted, saying,
"If both of you don't confine yourselves
to the trial of your case I'll make you." >
The plaintiff's case was not in at the
time the court adjourned. It will be re
sumed this morning.
CULL TO FRUIT-GROWERS
Convention to Consider Estab
lishment of a Public
Market.
The State Board of Horticulture
Takes Hold of the Enter
prise.
The State Board of Horticulture has is
sued the annexed call for a convention of
fruit-growers; and others to consider the
proposition to establish a public market
in San Francisco:
. San Francisco, Cnl., March 31, 1896.
Numerous petitions and resolutions from
granges, fruit associations and unions have
been presented to the State Hoard of Harbor
Commissioners, asking for the setting aside of
part of the water front for the establishment
of a public wholesale market for perishable
products, where any producer ma v sell or have
sold his products by any agent of" his choice.
The Harbor Commission has signified its
willingness to assign the necessary space and
to co-operate in all other ways in its' power, but
requires that the producers, through some or
ganization of their, own, shall have the direct
detailed management of the market, subject,
of course, to such regulations as the commis
sion may approve, in accordance therefore
with various requests made to the board, a
public convention of fruit-growers and others
interested is hereby called to meet at the
rooms of the Chamber of Commerce, 419 Cali
fornia street, San Francisco, on Thursday
April 16, 1896, at 10 a. m., to consider the sub
ject and determine whether in the judgment of
those present such a market as is proposed will
he advisable, and if so decided, to take the
necessary steps for its establishment and such
other action as the convention may deem wise.
All granges, fruit exchanges or other organi
zations of producers are "requested to send
duly accredited delegates to this meeting. All
transportation companies delivering perish
able proaucts to this City are requested to
send representatives to said convention. All
commission or other merchants dealing in
perishable proaucts are especially urged to be
present. The convention will be'addressed by
able speakers, thoroughly conversant with the
system of public markets, and will explain its
objects, etc.
The fruit season is rapidly advancing, and
in order to perfect an organization to handle
this year's fruit output and to complete ar
rangements no time must be lost, and it is
therefore hoped that every branch of the
fruit industry will be well represented. Very
respectfully, Eixwood Cooper, President.
B. M. Lklono, Secretary."
DRANK CARBOLIC ACID
Mrs. Nellie Paulden Committed
Suicide Last Even
ing.
She Was Weak Minded and Hysterical
From Long Continued 111
Health.
Mrs. Nellie Paulden, the wife of Charles
A. Paulden, bookkeeper for J. K. Armsby,
commission; merchant of 140 Market
street, committed suicide at her residence,
2515 Howard street, about 6:40 o'clock last
evening. . A few minutes ; before this she
walked from, the back part of the house,
where her husband and two little boys
were, into the front parlor, and while
alone in the room drank a part of a bottle
of carbolic acid.
Her husband Jheard her strangling as
the burning fluid went down 1 her throat,
ana running into the apartment found her
unconscious. He quickly summoned Drs.
Kirch holier and Mary Morse, but she lived
only a short time.
According, to the statement of the be
reaved husband sitting with his two little
children in the now motherless home, she
had long been in ill health and was often
hysterical from her sufferings.
"Her affliction -worked on her mind,"
said : he, ; "and she would cry frantically
over.real or fancied injuries. The stories
of crimes and suicides in the papers always
made her .', sad and she would brood over
them for hours. I know no reason why
she would kill herself.
"She was cheerful up to a minute before
she went into the parlor and swallowed
the acid and had ; been ~. talking to Mr.
Bridges, one of our neighbors, of a; trip to
the beach to-morrow. I don't know any
reason for it." â¢ "
Paulden is a nephew of Charles Ashlon,
the ,i real-estate man; and is known as a
sober,, industrious man ,and exceedingly
kind to his family. The suicide was a native
of London,' aeed 32 years. The little boys
are aged 7 and 3 years, respectively.
The Princess of ; Wales and . her daugh
ters are to make Sandringham their heads
.quarters until -j Easter, when ; they wili go
to Copenhagen for a fortnight to attend
the wedding of Princess Louise of Den
mark and Prince Frederick of Schaum

Attorney-General Fitzgerald Advocates
the Validity of the Schedule Fixed
by the Commission. ;-! i
Attorney-General Fitzeerald did a hard
day's labor yesterday. It was all on ! be
half of the people's side in the railway
controversy and without fee, other than
the gratification necessarily derived from
the thorough performance of one of the
most weighty duties of his office.
The argument being essentially a legal
one without oratorical fireworks or clap
trap, was too dry for the average layman,
and outside of the persons directly inter
ested, the official shorthand reporters of
the court, the newspaper reporters who
were. not in the least troubled with in
somnia, the artists who were obliged to
draw upon their resources to keep awake,
the lawyers, the clerk, the bailiff and
Judge McKenna, there was but one spec
tator, Barney Doherty, but he was a spec
tator only in the Pickwickian sense, for he
mistook the courtroom for a church, At
torney-General Fitzgerald for a seven
teentlily Methodist preacher and the
argument for a sermon on the vanities of
human life, and therefore dozed and
nodded, and nodded and dozed again.
Judge Fitzgerald showed that he had
profited by the adjournment of two weeks,
lor he had a. pyramid of authorities before
him. ' He turned his attention first to the
discussion of the legality of the acts ofthe
Railroad Commissioners, and to the con
stitutionality of the law creating the com
mission. Its legislative powers were given
it by tne constitution, he said, and it had
powers equal to those ( formerly held by
the Legislature with regard to the fixing of
fares and freight.
Tne argument advanced by the railroad
company to show that Commissioner La
Rue was disqualified was taken up and
combated.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald, after the
noon recess, proceeded with his argument.
He read from the concurring opinion of
Justice Miller in a Minnesota case ana re
ported in the 156 th volume United States
Reports.
In that opinion Justice Miller says that
the State has the legislative power to
establish the rate of compensation of com
mon carriers. But if those rates are ex
orbitant so as to be a burden on the pa
trons of the road, or if they are so low
that the property of the cairier would be
destroyed or confiscated, there are reme
dies for both of these evils, and the'- only
way in which these remedies can be ap
plied is by a bill in chancery.
Here Judge McKenna interrupted the
argument by remarking that he was afraid
that he did not understand the Attorney-
General's argument. A case is brought 111
the State of California, he said, on the
ground that the Railroad Commissioners
had established unreasonable rates and
the constitution says that those rates
shall be held to be conclusive in the
action. The defense is : set up that the
action of the Commissioners is unconsti
tutional, inasmuch as they Have acted un
reasonably. "Could a Californian court
hear that defense?" inquired' Judge Mc-
Kenna. ."-;â ':. '- .'"'.
'â¢Certainly they could," replied â â¢ the
Attorney-General. "Any law passed by
the Legislature is the law the l&ll(l-V.u'Uli
pronounced to be unconstitutional, end
when it is so pronounced it is void and in
operative."
Judge Hayne remarked that it was not
necessary to go further than to say, that
the validity of those rates was subject to
judicial investigation, but the reason why
they are valid or invalid is another matter.
"The rates fixed by. the Railroad Commis
sioners are conclusive, short of confisca
tion," added Judge Hayne: â¢';+
"Rates are never unreasonable," said
the Attorney-General, "unless they are
connscative."
"You have argued," Â«aid Judge Mc-
Kenna, 'that the act of the commission
was a legislative act; that when they nave
acted, what they hayÂ» done becomes the
law of the land. You have further
argued that what they did was bind
ing upon everybody, except as against
a 'direct proceeding to set those
rates aside, and that in all collateral
proceedings they were valid. Now, would
not an inquiry by me into the reasonable
ness or unreasonableness oi those rates be
proper?"
"That depends upon what you mean by
reasonableness," suggested Judge Hayne.
"In all controversies, civil or criminal,
the rates of fares and freights established
by the State Commission shall be deemed
conclusively just and reasonable," con
tinued the" court. "Shall the court stop
right there or shall it go further? And it'
it go further is it to disregard the constitu
tion?"
After some suggestions from the Attor
ney-General and' Judge de Haven the
court with a smile remarked that the
Attorney-General might just as well go on
with his argument, but he would say that
the court did not understand it. ,
The Attorney-General explained that
until there had been an attempt, by the
proper officers to enforce those rates then,
and only then, could the reasonableness of
the rates be questioned.
â  Judge Fitzgerald went en with: his argu
ment and took; up Mr. Hernn's appeal to
the debates of the. constitutional conven
tion for the purpose of ascertaining what
was really meant by that -convention.
That would be proper, he argued, where
the language of the. constitution was
doubtful or ambiguous or meaningless or
full of contradictions. But in cases where
the act of the Legislature or the language
of the constitution shows upon its -face
what was intended by the Legislature the
debates are not to be resorted to. The
rules of construction with reference to
legislative : acts ; are somewhat different
from the rules of construction as applied
to the constitutional provisions. "You
can never look to anything outside of the
language of the constitution except where
that language <is : either meaningless or
where its provisions are contradictory."
Authorities were read in support of the
contention that the law contemplated that
common ' carriers ;; should : ;v be allowed : * to
earn something, no matter how much or
how ? little, 1 - and that they : should ' stand
unless they were so obnoxiously unreason
able as to amount tojeonfiscation. . ,;. ; i

MUCH TESTIMONY GIVEN
Every Interest Affected by the
V Navigation of the Creek
Represented.
CONTENTION OF THE RAILROAr
Opposed to the 150-Foot Drawâ Will
Build a Steel Structure at Alice
Street in 1898.
â  â 
Every interest affected by the mainte
nance and operation of the Webster-street
and Alice-street bridges over Oakland
Creek was represented at the meeting held
yesterday in the office of Colonel C. R.
Suter of the United States Engineer Corps,
who is in charge of the San Francisco and
Oakland harbors. This conference was
the final one to discuss before Colonel
Suter, representing the War Department,
the effect on navigation of the mainte
nance and present method of operating the
two structures mentioned.
There were present: Mayor Davie
of Oakland, District Attorney Snook of
Alameda County; W. G. Curtis, engineer
of maintenance and way of the Southern
Pacific Company; Lyman Bridges of
the Haywards and San Leandro Railway
Company; John McMullen, president of
the San Francisco Bridge Company, and
E. F. Adams, a wharf-owner of Oakland.
To clearly present the situation it is
necessary to state that the Webster-street
bridge is owned by the county, and that
the Southern Pacific Company has the use
of the structure in return for paying
monthly the sum of $100 for the services
of a bridge-tender and keeping the bridge,
except the . flooring, in repair, while the
Alice-street bridge, farther east, is the
property of the Southern Pacific Company
The principal proposition related to in
creasing the draw-span in both bridges so
as to give 150 feet of clear opening. The
draw-span in the Alice-street bridge is now
79 feet, while that of the Webster-street
bridge is 82 feet. Another question was
the feasibility of substituting one combi
nation railway and highway bridge for
the two bridges now in use.
The Tosition of the railroad company
was that 100 feet of the opening was ample
and that a longer draw would make an
unwieldy mass, difficult to handle and
. control. Mr. Curtis stated, however, that
whatever might be the ruling of the Sec
retary of War in the mater it would be
submitted to by the railroad company..
He added that if tbe company was given
until December 31. 1897, it would replace
the Alice- tirrc-t bridge with a permanent
steel structure, operated by some mechan
ical power, to carry both toe broad and
narrow gauge trains, abandoning entirely
'vtÂ£e Webster-street bridge, over which the
oaf it/W^ngll lTftihÃ 119% Tiln. â o " *""n
Air. Curtis also took up the matter of
complaints in reference to tbe manner in
which the bridges are operated. He said
that both bridges were unlocked by signals
governing the movement of trains in that
vicinity. When a tram signals the ap
proach to the bridge, which is done auto
matically through an electric circuit
along th'i track, a bell rings in the signal
tower, j The tower operator and the bridge
tenders then exchange signals. If it is the
judgment of the bridge-tender that a ves
sel is approaching so as "to pass through
the bridge before the train can cross over
it. he hignifies that fact to the tower oper
ator, unlocks his bridge end opens it to
the vessel, thereby preventing the tower
man from giving any signal permitting a
train to approach the bridge.
If, oruthe other hand, he concludes that
the train can cross without delaying the
vessel he so signifies to the tower man and
then locks the bridge. In this way, Mr.
Curtis stated, the safe passage of both
trains and vessels is assured, Vessels, he
Continued, are always given precedence
when they an ivc simultaneously with a
train. These at least are the orders to the
bridge-tenders, he said. If the bridges
were not operated under this system it
was the bridge-tender's fault. So far as
the railroad's control of the matter went
Mr. Curtis stated that it courted all well
grounded complaints and would redress
ail just grievances that the vessel men had
against the bridge-tenders. Most of the
complaints, he claimed, were against the
Webster street or county bridge-tender.
Â«i Mayor Davie presented a petition from a
large number of vessel-owners asking for
belter facilities at the bridges. The mari
time interests are strongly in favor of one
bridge, as tending to obstruct navigation
lesi tnan two.
District Attorney Snook took the posi
tion that the county is without authority
to do more than "maintain the Webster
street bridge as it now exists, and that
State legislation would be necessary before
the Webster-street bridge could be done
away with and all traffic confined to one
structure.
John McMullen stated that in his opin
ion the county officials did have authority
to make all necessary changes in this
respect without appealing to the Legisla
ture. -
Lyman Bridges suggests that the Gov
ernment engineers should take into ac
count the feasibility of a great bridge
across the bay, which might be constructed
by a properly organized terminal com
pany, thus affording a railroad entrance
into San Francisco for all railroads now
terminating at Oakland. The matter was
not considered germane to the subject
under discussion and received but a pass
ing notice. .-.:."
Colonel Suter will now weigh all the
testimony and documentary evidence sub-,
mitted to him and then forward the
same with his own recommendations- in
the matter to the Secretary of War, whose
decision will settle the whole controversy.
THE ALAMEDA BRIDGES.
For Years the Means of Travel
Over the Estuary Have' Been
Inadequate.
The most important question in Oakland
and Alameda relating to railroads or
highways has long been recognized as the
problem of the estuary bridges connecting
the two cities at Alice and Webster streets.
There is a poor old county bridge at
Webster street. It is maintained by, the
railroad company as compensation for the
privilege of i mining the Oakland narrow
gauge trains over it. It is the only public
bridge connecting, the cities except at the
eastern extremity of the estuary, where
stands the landlocked drawbridge at Park
street. .
The Webster-street bridge is altogether
unsuitable and too narrow for the traffic
over it. That has been an uncontradicted
declaration in Oakland and Alameda for
ten or twenty years. The bridge has van*,
ous elements of unsafely; and with - most
of Its surface occupied by the railroad and
electric car tracks,', while ;an antiquated
draw is operated in the slow and ancient
fashion, it in some respects resembles a
trap.
â  It is a trap. Everybody admits that.
Five or six years agoâ the date is marked
more accurately in the death ' records of
several Oakland familiesâ an engine and
one or two cars were caught. About a year
ago another accident occurred, in which a
car took twenty- or thirty passengers
down into the water, killing some and in
juring many more. Last year an electric
.car, crossing the bridge on a dark night,
plunged from the bridge into the water,
for there were no lights and no signal was
given that the draw was open. No lives
were lost, for the reason that there were
no passengers in the car.
â¢With a suitable bridge accidents under
circumstances such as governed these
would be impossible.
The Alice-street bridge, apparently 150
or 200 yards up the estuary, is- owned by
the railroad company. It is hardly a
modern structure, and supported on piles
it has not been regarded with complete
confidence by those who travel over it.
There is no public way over the Alice
street bridge and the main travel by
wagon between Oakland and Alameda
must be over the Webster-street bridge.
With the two bridges so close together
the narrow-gauge railroad and the broad
gauge are made to cross each other in an
awkward manner at the foot of Webster
street, Oakland, and the location â¢of the
double crossing is disadvantageous to the
ordinary public travel from one city to the
other.
Equally objectionable to navigation are
the two bridges regarded by the men who
have to take vessels up and down the estu
ary. The slow-moving draw at Webster
street has a span of eighty-two feetâ the
railroad men in charge of it sayâ is.
eighty-two feet on each side of the central
pier.
Just above that is the Alice-street draw
bridge, with a span of only seventy-nine
feet.
Over the Webster-street bridge are run
four trains an hour; electric-cars pass one
way or the other _ every three or four min
utes; much of the freight for Alameda is
hauled that way from the boats that run
to the foot of Broadway, and there is a
constant procession of vehicles going in
each direction. *3PSJ
The marine traffic, up and down the es
tuary, is also very large and the shippers
and boatmen have a hard time.of it in
getting, through the pair of old.draw
bridges. The bridgetenders usually have
somebody waiting for attention, either on
the roadway or in the stream, and their
lot would be a hard one but for the navi
gators directing their profanity at the rail
road company as responsible for the con
ditions, and the trainmen and car con
ductors have acquired . the philosophical
habit of swearing at the county for build
ing such a bridge.
There is swearing enough on both ends,
but that doesn't help the bridge, which is
the middle.
Mayor Davie of Oakland even declares
that the railroad company has the bridge
men trained to keep the drawbridges closed
as long as possible when his freight
steamer is waiting to go through, aud
shipping men in general say that all the
advantages are given to the trains... ;i .'â¢'
However these things may be, all the
men concerned agree that the VWebster
street bridge cannot be made to conform'
to ail the demands upon it. ..In, every
way it is too small. If the draw were al
ways open the room for the vessels to
pass would be limited, and if it were al
ways closed the jamming of teams and
electric cars could not be prevented. Oc
casionally a ship that is being taken up or
down the stream sweeps against the pier,
and in that there have been long delays
to travel over the bridge.
Various plans of effecting a remedy have
been discussed during the past ten years
without practical result, but it is believed
that a solution of the problem has at last
been reached. SPS
The railroad company has offered to
give up its right of way over the Webster
street; bridge, leaving to the two cities tne
entire use of that bridge. It wants to re
place the Alice-street bridge with a new
steel structure and to run the^narrow;
J^Bge ana broad-gauge trains oyer that.
Plans for such a bridge have been pre
pared about a year," the railroad men say,
and it is apparent that the project was
adopted when Oakland clamored lor such
ii change after the accident in which' Sim
mons and others were killed at the Web
ster-street bridge.
The plans of the proposed bridge, how
ever, call for a draw with a span of only
100 feet on each side of the central pier.
The shipping- men interested in the estu
ary traffic demand that the span in â â any
new bridge be not less than 150 feet, and
upon this point a hitch is expected.
;VV. G. Curtis, assistant to the general
manager of the Southern Pacific Company,
said last night:
"The railroad company's proposition is
to rebuild the Alice-street bridge, which it
owns. The company will build a steel
bridge on a masonry foundation. The
plans that we have adopted call for a 100
--loot span. The company would object to
a 150-foot span as unnecessary, but would
accede to whatever might be required by
the Government engineers."
Mr. Curtis says that the plan is for a
bridge to be used exclusively by the rail
road. That would not do away with the
present inconvenience of two bridges so
close together, but Mr. Curtis announces
that if the county wants to consider the
plan of building a joint bridge with the
roadway over the railroad tracks the com
pany is ready to enter into negotiations
The establishment of a county and rail
road brid_e at Alice street would mean the
abandonment of the Webster-street struc
ture. Then the electric railroad would
have to be changed lite 'the narrow-gauge
road. In Alameda a new street would be
run through to the Alice-street bridge,
probably from McPherson street. It is
urged by some that the change would be a
detriment to Alameda, but there has yet
been no off'r'al action . regarding the
matter.
What Alameda men do speak about with
appreciation is the prospect of having the
trains run over a more substantial bridge
than the present one, and the Oakland
commuters who travel over the narrow
gauge line are enthusiastic about the con
templated change of their route.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 1, 1896.
MRS. FOLTZ ON SUFFRAGE
The Well-Known Lady Lawyer
Compares the East With
the West.
MANY CLUBS BEING FORMED.
Predicts Woman's Triumph in Califor
nia and Pays Tribute to Noted
Leaders.
"I find women in the East, as here,
anxious to participate in political affairs,
but there seems to exist in that section of
the country a better understanding of the
questions at issue." â¢
buch was the reply of Mrs. Clara Foltz,
the well-known woman lawyer, delivered
to an interviewer at the residence of her
daughter, Mrs. Fayette Smalley, 404 Haight
street. The question was as to the interest
taken in the cause of female suffrage by
its proponents in the far east. Mrs. Foltz
has just returned to California for a short
visit to those early associations with which
she was surrounded while here. With her
characteristic energy she has already
thrown herself into the thick of the fray
CLARA SUOUTRIDGE FOLTZ.
[From her latest photograph by Parkinson, New York.]
for the cause of female suffrage in this
State. " -i'y-y^y
"For instance," added Mrs. Foltz, in ex
planation of her first statement, "there is
a misunderstanding as to what the 'new' '
is. The 'new' woman is her husband's
comrade, her brother's associate, and
her son's counselorâ a woman who finds
her highest pleasure in life, in being
at heme and in the company of those who \
are nearest and dearest to her. -She is not a I
great, big slattern with a club in her hand 'â¢â 
and a stain upon her tongue, but she I
wishes to be man's political equal and ad- ;
viser. Eastern people understand her far '
better than W stern people. That is the
way it seems to strike me, at least. The
women themselves seem to understand
the value of a social interest in political
affairs. The State is the home, isn't it?
and the mother is the guardian of the
1 home? and the son cannot hope to rise
higher than his source? Well, then, if
j women are careless and indifferent as to
j the science of government, it follows as a
logical conclusion that their sons wiil be
equally so. No woman can be interested
in a thing of which she knows nothing,
and neither can she inculcate into her son
the principles of that of which she is ig
norant."
Mrs. Foltz is an excellent exemplar of
the fact that a belief in "woman's rights"
does not necessarily tend to unsex woman.
"Yes," she continued, "I know that
some women have forgetten themselves,
and while lighting for the emancipation
of the sex have acted in a manner which
has given our opponents the chance to
sneer at us and ridicule the movement.
But a true woman will be a woman and a
mother in politics as well as in the home."
"What do you think of affairs in Cali
fornia, Mrs. Foltz? Are you satisfied with
the progress you are making?"
"Immensely ! Immensely ! The women
as you well know; were greatly encouraged
by the action of the Republicans in in
serting the twenty-ninth plank in their
platform two years ago. declaring for
equal suffrage. We have organized clubs
in almost every county in the. State.
These clubs are auxiliary to the State Suf
frage Association, of which Mrs. A.'A.
, Sargent; is; president. I think it was a
j great compliment to the association when
Mrs. Sargent decided to accept the presi
dency. Her husband advocated our cause
in the Senate with great ability, and in my
opinion it is most consistent thai his
widow should carry on the noble work of
benefiting her sex. The headquarters of
the association is at her home, 1630 Fol
som street. \ .â â -..-.â .â  - .;.
"After the arrival of Miss' Anthony and
Dr. Anna Shaw, in connection with Mrs.
Nellie Holbrook Blir.n, they - decided to
adopt the plan of parlor suffrage meetings
conducted with such success in the East.
Already clubs are organized in every As
sembly District. At Colonel C. H. Blinh's
. last! night" the Invincible -Club was
organized. I was present, and . I must
say that : 1 spent the most delight
ful evening of my life.* Mrs. -Blinn,
ex-president of the State Suffrage Associa
tion, was elected president, Mrs. Harland
corresponding secretary, and even Colonel
Blinn himself and W. McNeil accepted
offices and promised to help the ladies in
: | their battle for equality. Â§ Miss Anthony's
j speech was devoted to explaining the best
j way to carry on this campaign, and y after
so many years' experience there is no one
. so capable of mapping out the plan of
'conquest as she. '
"Mrs. -Blinn-, has been sick, but she has
now fully recovered, and will take part in
the campaign with her former vigor. We
will carry on the fight from house to
house; from Van â  Ness avenue." Here
Mrs. Foltz stopped and laughed heartily
at the incongruity into which her enthusi
asm had led her.
"Asa parting, speech," said this versa
tile lady, ."let me state that I never. appre
ciated the services of the old warhorses so
much as I did last night."
Stole From Her Mother.
Mrs. . Ella Beuschultz of 54 Morris avenue
swore , out ;a ; warrant *in Judge Joachlmson's
court yesterday for the arrest of her daughter
Laura Patterson, on j the charge of grand lar
ceny. She alleges that on April 16, 1895, her
daughter stole . a gold ' watch valued : at $60
from her and pawned: it and now she wants
her punished for it. " â  ;,;
INTERESTS WHEELMEN.
Position of the Racing Board Toward
Amateur and Relay
, Riders. ' : -;.' '.y.
R. M. Welch, representative of the
League of American Wheelmen's racing
board in California, received a letter from
Chairman Gideon of the board yesterday,
which is of particular interest to the
wheelmen of this State and elsewhere. It
deals with the relay races, what constitutes
amateur prizes, and how an employe of a
manufacturer may be made a professional.
It is as follows:
Philadelphia, March 261 896.
My Dear Mr. Welch: Replying to yours of
March 30 I am entirely satisfied to await the
end of tne relay before making transfers.
II a man has contracted with a manufacturer
to ride that manufacturers' wheel he is no
longer an amateur, but we have no jurisdiction
over him unless he appears on the track.
in regard to expenses paid for amateur road
racing we cannot take cognizance unless the
man makes. his appearance, in a track race.
Under the rules only the acts of competing
with or pacing a professional, competing for
casli prizes, or selling prizes won in a road
race, will transfer to the professional class for
road-racing. A man who has his expenses
paid for such racing, if he is limited to nis
expenses and not paid money for racing, is no
worse than the average college or A. A. U.
athlete. r
The provision of the . bylaws giving us cen
sorship over prizes undoubtedly permits us to
prescribe the character of amateur prizes, and
two years ago we did limit them to medals,
jewelry, plate and cycle sundries; but it was
so much trouble and worked such an injustice
in little petty cases that it was found impracti
cable and consequently was â  abandoned, "al-
though I still believe it was right. Very truly
yours, . *..._ George D. Gideon. .
The construction of a six-lap board
track will be commenced in Central Park
April 25, and a National circuit race meet
ing will be held on it May 16. The circuit
will open at Santa Rosa April 30, May 1 and
2, continuing at San Jose May 9, San Fran

THE OLYMPIC WRESTLERS
A Large Gathering . of Ladies
Witnessed the Tourna
ment. ; , * -
Contests Which Were Not Very Spir
itedâBouts Postponed to a-,.
Future Date.
â 
A large gathering of ladies witnessed
the catch-as-catch-can wrestling tourna
ment of the Olympic Club last evening,
and, judging from the interest they mani
fested in the contest, the cport seemed to
please them. Between the bouts, the
world-famous head balancers, the Pantzer
brothers, gave a very excellent exhibition
of tumbling and other features of athletics,
at which they have no equal. Their head
balancing was simply marvelous, and took
the audience by sui prise' : .
The wrestling' commenced at 8 o'clock
sharp and continued until 11 o'clock.when
Superintendent Kennedy announced that
owing to the lateness of the hour the finals
would be contested some evening in! the
near future. â ;' ' ' '- ' 1 "''
.Some of the bouts were very interesting,
but there were a number, of contests very
tiresome because the contestants remained
on the defensive and made little or no at
tempts at wrestling. ' .*, .-"..â '
The spectators expected to hear the
referee caution the wrestlers and then
order the contestants who persisted in
defensive work? to "heir dressing-rooms.
The bouts were of ten minutes' duration,
but in some instances' the timekeeper ex
tended the time limit to at least fifteen
minutes.' '.'.:'â  â¢â¢'"..'- .â â¢â â --;

ATTORNEY WIRT'S SUGGESTION
His Attack on Tobin and Alvord Now
With Attorney-General
Fitzgerald.
N. S. Wirt, the . attorney, who recently
attacked the validity of the appointment
of Police Commissioners Tobin and Alvord,
undertook iast Monday to inform the
Attorney-General of . California upon the
facts forming the foundation: for a claim
that these two officials have no legal right
to hold their office. In presenting the
facts Wirt sent the following letter to the
State's attorney :,â¢*'*, '.""",
â â â >"_â -: /San Francisco, Cal., March 30, 1896.
Hon. W. F. Fitzgerald, Attorney-General, State
of Californiaâ Dear Sir: Knowing that the
Governor of this State has referred the whole
matter pertaining to the appointment of Police
Commissioners for the City and County of San
Francisco for your legal opinion, in such case
made and provided, it ought to be my duty,
under the circumstances, to render you an
epitome of the information which has been
obtained from the records and other sources.
Two of the incumbents in officeâ J.
Tobin and William Alvordâ were appointed by
the District Judges in April, 1878, and each of
them failed and neglected to file his oath of
office until May 5, 1885, which the book of
original entries of official oaths fully shows in
the County Clerk's office of this City and
County in the due and regular course of entry
required for all official oaths. '.:.; v . '.
Neither of said official oaths, which are re
quired to be filed, can be found in that office,
and they are missing from the usual box kept
for that purpose. No one has the right to take
the filed records away. The case of Hinton vs.
Hammond was decided just about that time.
The entire business is for future reflection and
action.: ' .
It is provided by sections 907 and 909 of the
Political Code that the oath of office must be
taken, subscribed and filed in any case before
the expiration of fifteen days from the com
mencement of his term of office, and duly tiled
In the office of the County Clerk. This being
true, their office was, is now and ever has been
vacant. : "
Section 996 of said code thus provides: "An
office -becomes vacant on the happening of
either of the following events before the ex
piration of the term: 1. The death of the in
cumbent, 2. Ills resignation.. * * * 9.
His refusal or neglect to tile his official oath or
bond within the time prescribed."
"If he failed to do these things according to
law, and within the time required by law, the
office was vacant."
Hull vs. Superior Court, 65 Cal., 176.
Tne legal opinion which â  you are to render,
whatever may be the final result, hopes are
entertained that it will be based on reason
and the best authority, and when all is re
judged by the community, you can conscien
tiously consider that you duly performed and
truly executed an important duty in your
public career required by the constitution.
Yours respectfully, , . N. S. Wirt,
. Attorney-at-law, Supreme Court building.
Said Wirt yesterday:
In my judgment the whole question about
the. Police Commissioners has been a sort of a
compound double-complex combination. A
great majority of the people understand that
the constitution is the supreme law. They be
lieve that there should be no life tenure in
such offices, and (hat there should be no per
petuity in such offices, and that it is against
the.spirit and policy of a tree and republican
form of government.
Blackstone lays down the doctrine of the
Kings-p erpetuity in office, which, while he
lives in his natural capacity, is called his
Kingship or imperial dignity. *
It seems that the Supreme Court of this State
in deciding all of. the late cases never had
its attention called to section 9 of article XI
of the constitution, which thus provides: "The
compensation of any county, city or municipal
officer shall not be increased - after his efec
tionor during iris term of office; nor shall the
term of any such officer be extended beyond
the period for which he is elected or appointed."
This provision controls and puts a limitation
upon all provisions of; the statute and all de
cisions not bearing upon and giving a con
struction to this constitutional- provision.
The Supreme Court in a vÂ»ry late case has de- N
cided that there are other vacancies besides
those mentioned in section 996 of the Political
Code, and which case was fully and ably ar
gued by a whole array of promine it counselors
at law. It is well known that we cite too
many authorities before the courts whicn have
no real application in principle, and that the
best jurists admonish and do advise that two
or three leading cases which contain the prin
ciple involved in the case in question at issue
are far better than volumes which have no real
actual application and add no weight- to -the
principle involved in the case and no author
ity for adjudication. The petition sent to the
Governor of this State was prepared with care,
and he acted upon it according to the constitu
tion and referred it to the Attorney-General of
this State.
If new Commissioners should be appointed
it is claimed that by section 1085 of the Code
of Civil Procedure they could be seated by
speedy proceedings by writ of mandamus in
the Supreme Court of this State. I have no
animosity or ill will against any one, but I sin
cerely believe that the law should be our rule
and the constitution our guide.'
Police Commissioner Alvord laughed at
the claims of Wirt. "These things," he
said, "invariably come up about political
times. I don't know; that there is any
thing worthy of notice in the matter. * I
received mv appointment from Governor
Waterman July 11, 1890. On July 12, 1800,
I took i he official oath, which was recorded
in the County Clerk's office July 17 follow
ing. I suppose on that date we tiled the
oaths, Mr. Tobin and myself, and then
held a meeting.
"There is certainly nothing strange in
the statement that the oaths were ex
tracted from the County Clerk's office. We
can't help that. It is not our business to
act as custodians of documents filed in the
County Clerk's office."
Commissioner Tobin said he had filed his
oath of office when first appointed, but he
could not remember the date. Long after
ward he was appointed by Governor Wat
erman in conformity with" a new law. At
that time the whole commission received
official appointments from Waterman, to
which were appended the great seal of the
State. â¢ It is under these documects that
both Messrs. Tobin and Alvord are: now
holding- office. Commissioner Tobin said
he had secured legal advice upon the ques
tion : and felt satisfied that "the appoint
ment was v valid. The old appointment
had no bearing upon the case from the day
that Waterman issued those documents in
1890. _
MARTINI IN A HIGH FEVER
The Chances of His Recovery
Are Now Extremely
Doubttul.
Mrs. Martin Receives a Large Number
of Lady Callers at the City, '
Prison. :if;^
John F. Martin, Deputy County Clerk,
is hovering between life and death at the
Receiving Hospital. He seemed to 7 im
prove yesterday, but last night he was in
a high fever and the worst was feared. Â-";â '.
Dr. Fitzgibbon, who ; has f charge of the
patient, positively refused to permit any
one to see him. His sister; Mrs. Musante,
and h his '; foster-mother, . Mrs. Chase, .420
McAllister street, -were I among the callers,
but they had to leave without seeing him.
The doctor is sanguine of pulling him
through unless peritonitis; should set in,
but few, if any /share his opinion. \,
"The course of the bullet," said the doc
tor,: "was most 'remarkable. : It entered
the back directly beneath the lung, and,
though; its path * lay "directly between the
man's -most vital '{ organs, v contact i with
them ; was : escaped.' The? bullet took . a
downward and ' then â¢ an ; outward course,
i and, though it passed between the liver,
j kidney; and . lung, none of these vital or
gans were touched." .
.Martin was â â , told yesterday. morning of
his wife's solicitude ; for /him, and, in
answer to a question as to whether he
wished to send her any message, he shook
his head and added thai he had received a
message from her on Monday night and
that was all he cared for, at least for the
present. â¢
Mrs. Martin was much calmer yesterday
and was resting somewhat : easier. , Her
sister, Mrs. Ned Foster, is constantly with
her, and does all she can to soothe her. A
large number of lady friends called at the
City Prison to see her yesterday, but they
weie not permitted to stay, beside her long.
She inquired of every one as to the condi
tion of her husband, and when she heard
of his improved condition yesterday morn
ing she seemed-, greatly pleased. The
change for the worse in "his ' condition last
night was kept from her.
One of the callers upon her last night
was Louis | G-. Musante, the husband of
Martin's sister. He was not permitted to
see her, but sent. her a note. : He said:
"Susie was a mighty good wife to Martin.
She was thoroughly domestic in her habits
and did all she could for him. Her story
of his treatment of her is not far from the
truth."
Carroll Cook has been retained to defend
Mrs. Martin, and in accordance with his
instructions both she and Mrs. Foster de
clined to say anything further as to the
causes that led up to her shooting her hus
band. '<
Martin assigned his warrant a few days
ago as patrol driver to Soloman Kampe in
the Columbia building, but instead of
being for ten days it was for the full
month, $90. Kampe called at the County
Clerk's .office yesterday, but found that
Martin had assigned his warrant for $100 â
twenty days' pay to Ferdinand Smith,
Montgomery street. Kampe is, however,
satisfied that if Martin recovers he will be
repaid the $60 overdrawn.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
, ' Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V., March 31.-Business at
the Stock Exchange was on a larger scale, and the
increase in the trading was accompanied by higher
pri.es for the industrials, the grangers and the
international Issues generally. The dealin s in
stocks aggregated 214.400 shares and were unusu
ally well disTrinuted. More interest was mani
â¢ tested by outsiders, and commission brokers re
ported slight increase in the demand from custom
ers who have held aloof of late. The tact that
there were no shipments of gold to-day and that
ro engagements for to-morrow's steamers were
announced, notwithstanding a further rise of *U>d
in posted rates of sterling exchange, led to cover
ing or short contracts put out last week when the
street was flooded with rumors of another impor
tant efflux of the metal and had considerable to do
with the chance for the better.
Bank officials also stated that commercial and
financial conditions at the West were improving
this week. The increased returns recently reported
by the roads centering at Chicago led" to higher
prices for grangers and incidentally exerted a
favorable , influence on the general market. The
erangeis pained anywhere from 11,4 to 214 per
cent. Bock Island and Chicago. Burlington and
Qnlncy were in particulagly good request. The in
dustrials were most prominent in the day's opera
lions, Sugar led in point of activity and rose to
1 17V 8 , the best price reached since the current up
ward movement in the stock market.
Tobacco, which closed at 89' yesterday ranged
between 89*4 and 90*; with the'final transactions
at 895 /8 . There were all sorts of rumors afloat
concerning the company. It was said that nego
tiations are progressing with outside manufactur
ers that the Eastern factories had shut down and
that the directors <>f the company intended to de

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 11.1., March 31.â selling of
wheat this morning proved more influential than
the buying, and the inevitable result was a decline
in prices. Brokers were offering freely, the belief
existing that their orders came from Armour. The
trace is now Decommg greater in the July and less
in the May, this, being more noticeable today than
on any day yet. Opening prices were rather firm,
the strength parity arising from lignter arrivals In
the Northwest, 495 cars against 705 last Tuesday
and 654 a year ago. and partly from the natural
tendency of prices to rally after yesterday's break.
Liverpool cables were, steady at y4d decline.
Chicago receipts were 27 cars and 183,370 bushels
were withdrawn from store. Very soon after the
opening the steady to firm tone disappeared and
recessions followed. There was a recovery from
the low point on covering by local shorts. Brad
street's gave a decrease in the world's available
supply of 2,236,000 bushels, the effect of which
was rather detrimental than otherwise to prices.
Thoman's report was issued to-day. It made the
condition of winter wheat 80.6 per cent. Export
clearances were 376.524 bushels. Closing Paris
cables were lower. Berlin higher and Antwerp un
changed. May wheat opened from 633/ cto 631-2 C,
sold between 63""4cand 63c, closing at 63VÂ»c, 8 c
under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor
row. 10 cars.
CORNâ Engaged no particular interest and the
market was about as dull as it was possible to be.
The opening firmness and later weakness of wheat
exercised a controlling influence on corn, prices of
the latter moving in the same direction of those of
the former. Receipts were 461 cars and 100,176
bushels were withdrawn from store. Liverpool
cables were quiet and easy. Rradstreet's gave an
increase in stocks of 410.000 bushels. Export
clearances were extremely heavy at 675.316 bush
els. May corn opened at 29", 2 c. sold between 291*;
*~o29**&C and 29Â»/ B e, closing at 29""5a.29'/ 2 c, a shade
under yesterday. Estimated receipts lor to-mor
row 1 60 cars.
OATSâ The tone of the oats market was identi
cal with that of the other grains and was ruled by
sympathy with them. Receipts were 324 cars and
1200 bushels were taken from store. Rradstreet's
reported an increase in stocks of 965,000 bushels.
May oats closed a shade firmer and fractionally
higher than yesterday, but the distant futures were
lower. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 112 cars.
FLAXâ Was easy early, firming later. Cash,
88c: May. 87@87y c: July, 68Vi bid; September,
90V4(?91i4c. Receipts were 18 cars. ,
PROVISIONSâ Product was neither active nor
dull, but about medium between the two. The
feeling was however decidedly weak owing to a
lower hog market. May pork closed 25c lower,
May lard 5c lower and May ribs "Vie lower.

another decline of 10c took place. The supply
was not heavy. The receipts of -sheep were heavy.

The Making of Tacks.
"Where do the pins go to?" is a common
saying, but when one takes a few notes of
the tack industry the question, "Where do
all the tacks go to?" seems to be the next
question in order.
; The first tacks were made by hand. The
operator used a vise and dies. A bit of
metal was held with' a clamp, and the head
was made by striking a blow with a htim
mer. â - Later on" machinery began to "foc
used, and now metal is led into an enor
mous apparatus that will cut out nearly
300 tacks a minute. The processes
are extremely interesting, and a tack
factory has many visitors. The machinery
is automatic;* narrow strips of metal
are fed â in and clipped off, the
heads are made by pressure, and it
literally rains tacks into large boxes placed
underneath to receive them. They are
then poured into a tattler, which is a rap
idly revolving cylinder, through which a
jet of air is forced under high pressure.
This removes all of tho dust and loose par
ticles. Black lead is sometimes put in to
give them a polish, and then they pass on
to the sifter, which sorts them and takes
out the imperfect tacks, leaving the good
ones to be passed on and dropped into a
box, from which they are taken to be
packed by quick-lingered girls. A good
workwoman can pack 1600 pounds of tacks
in a day. When one realizes that many
of these machines are going, and that tacks
at this rate are being sent out to *,the mar
ket, the wonder growsâ where all the tacks
go to. â New York Ledger. V k-i

OFFICER SILL'S DISDAIN.
pe Says the Star Is Hoodooed, No
Matter What Explanation Is
Made.
'. Oakland Officii San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 31. j
1 Superstition has been overcome in the
Police Department, and there is now a
â ^rearer of star 13. For many months this
tinlucky-numbered star has been most
carefully avoided, but it has been resur
rected and polished and is now worn by
Special Charles Ford, who Is at present j
doing regular duty for Officer Greenwald. !
â  "Special Officer Ford is not superstitious. !
Indeed he is a member of the Salvation
Army and takes no stock in unlucky nam
bjers or omens, and when he was offeied a
regular beat for a time he jumped at the
c nance and marched off wearing the un
lucky star.
Captain Fletcher of the department is
somewhat pleased that he has at. last
fc >und a use for the unlucky star, and he
does not predict any evil to Ford for
sing it. . -i
."It is just this way," said the captain
to-night, "Ford would not have gone on a :
regular beat had it not been for the fact !
tliat Officer Greenwald had got married
arhd gone off on a vacation. Now, you Bee,
FJjrd came into the department under the j
awispices of Hymen, and as such any evil I
spell that may have attached to star 13 is j
broken. Had Ford taken the place of a
map that had been broke, then circum
statpces would have been different. Then
agajin Ford is a very steady fellow and a
me*mber of the Salvation Army. Those
people are altogether too practical to pay
any attention to unlucky numbers or any. !
such] silly notion. I guess thirteen will be j
all rig-it in the future."
Officer Sill, who discarded the unlucky
star nearly a year ago because he wore it
onthe,l3th day of the month when be
fore the commissioners for being a button
shy on his coat at a time when a fire
alarm was turned in from box 13, says he
will carefully watch the fate of the star in
the future. "Sill says that he does not put
a particle of faith in Captain etcher's
argument and says that if all the depart
ment were to get married it would not re
move the feeling that came over him when
that fire alarm blew out 13.
"Thirteen or any other number goes,"
said Ford to-day, "as long as I am paid for
wearing it.''

Fees Received by "Ballard. '.{'..
OAKLAND, Cal., March 31.â James W.
Ballard, who has just been dispossessed of
his office as License Tax Collector by the
Supreme Court decision and action of the
Board of Supervisors, turned all :of the I
books, blanks and other articles belonging
to the county which have come- into his
possession over to County Tax Collector
Barber to-day. f^^f- VM- -.'/-, .'_:
Sheriff C. B. White has been watching
affairs and to-day made the following
statement, which is meant as a warning
to all interested in the matter: 'â '.' '.':-â¢"
'â¢The fact that a man becomes delin
quent in his liquor license. tax makes him
as much a violator of the law as if he stole
or committed other crimes. . I suppose it
will cause more work to devolve upon this
office, but it makes no difference; all laws
must be obeyed alike. I will confer with
the Supervisors, and whatever thevjwant
done 1 shall see to it that no effort is
spared to carry out any plan as far as is in
my power." ....
Prepared for His Holiday...
OAKLAND, Cal., March 31.â Contractor
F. L. Hansen, the missing contractor of
this city, cleared his home of a mortgage
before leaving. It stands in his wife's
name, so she is cared for. . The day he dis
appeared he drew his last payment from
the United States Government", $14,000, for
the construction of barracks at the Pre
sidio.
It is claimed that he owed .fully $15,000.
One of his San Francisco creditors," A. H.
Rector, was in the city to-day looking his
record up and trying to find what the
chances were for ever realizing anything
upon the debt. His wife and family seem
to care very little about his disappearance,
and are doing little apparent worrying.
On Trial for Murder. â 'Â;
OAKLAND, Cal., March 31.â The trial

and the custody of the two children, aged
3 years and 8 months. She sets forth that

"j -In the hail over -the. Dv Bois place met
j the first 1 Board of Trustees of Oakland.
j The most historic event in connection with

I kept this city in litigation tor over twenty
years. - .' â  '- . ,- -'
The Dv Bois . restaurant was â  one of the
oldest places' in the. county. Thirty-six
years ago Mr. and Mrs. I)u Bois came.to
this coast and opened; a saloon, bowling
alley and boathouse on .the street that is
now Broadway. In those days the house :
was at the water's edge and the boats were
kept, in .a part of the house. \ The Dv Bola
place soon became, popular, and as nearly
all Oakland was then south' of what is now
Seventh street : it -was the scene of many :
merry -makings. . At that ".time it was, not
considered- advisable to go north of the
plaza, where the."- Hall: of .Records now
Btands,'and Mrs. Dii Bois says she can dis
tinctly recall. the terror the thought of go
ing beyond that place inspired. All along
the water.* front were houses and saloons,,
and ai! Oakland and gayety was cen
.tered there.* â â¢>. â¢ â¢ ,-" '< ', ' â¢"? }--y â  : â¢' Â° .;; s ; ' Â°Â°
In those days the old? Frenchman made
money, but it went as 'easily as "it came,
and when he died nearly twenty years ago
his wife 'was* left-penniless.- The ; landing
at Dv Bois' place was filled in and a wharf
built, obliterating all traces of I the former
boating Handing. The Dv Bois house and
tho old portico courthouse stood" side by
side ana - grew "'a old add dilapidated to
gether. -Mrs.. Dii- Bois? continued. to live
in her house," and it began to be filled with
curios.and relics brought by sea captains
who , used to patronize the place in, the
days of /the old man." ' , - 1 Â»
' When the lire came last night Mrs.
Dv Bois was' almost frantic in her efforts
to save' her 'treasures.;: She did not cease
trying to collect them together "â¢ till- the
flames ! drove her away. Then she first
realized. her danger. * She. rushed to : ' the
porch on the second floor, and, seizing the
signboard, swung "herself far .out and
landed in the street. Her keepsakes were
nearly .all. destroyed in .the. flames; to
gether "with about $200 in cash.

friends * searched ' ; among . the .ruins, but
onl>; succeeded in-recovering $,"0.
The total loss of the fire is greater than
was at first. supposed. | It is now i thought
that the losses will not be less â â ;â  than'
$30,000.

OAKLAND, Cal., March 31.â The ordi

the People vs. V. T. Broga, who had been
found guilty of its violation in the lower
court. The prisoner was discharged, which
will save his paying the $20 he was fined
last July when found guilty.
The section of the ordinance in question
reads: 'â¢Nothing herein contained shall

Sankey and Stebbins sing gave the manage
ment great hopes of a; fine sum from the
collection?, which they intended "taking
for the : Young Men's Christian Association':^
work; but there is great disappointment.
â¢ j The .vast audience - was . somewhat ' dis
satisfied at- the; trend the meeting took.;
All the:, churches. -closed: in honor of the
visitors, and it was thought that the affair
was going to; take the form of a.. huge
evangelistic : meeting. Instead, it : was an
appeal for funds for Y. M. C. A. .work, and
many expressed disapproval of that fact 1
and voted the union-meeting a failure in
spite of the great crowd. i
The polite ushers had been- carefully
drilled, and many of them were old hands
at gathering the stray nickels atcnureh :
meetings.; Row after row they passed find ;
failed to catch' even ; the" much-despis. d ]
penny. They then began to be apprehen
sive of their hats, and it was with a Jong
drawn sigh; of relief that they gained I
possession ,: of them at the close. j
When the ;'. sum : total ; had been added
it was found' that the lights could not be ; I
paid for out of the collection. Oaklanders
claim i that this fact can be accounted for
by the presence of five hundred San Fran
ciscans, who came' over on one train, and
many suburbans who came early and were
the first to get into the Tabernacle. They
give as a proof of "this that at the overflow
meeting held in the First " Presbyterian
Church, where most of the Oaklanders had
to go on being crowded out of the former
place, the collection amounted to $80 arid
pledges to $264. Â© ; :.
; Secretary McCoy of the San Francisco
association, who pleaded- so eloquently for
a large collection, was the most "dis

formed of the fact: He declared that in

ATHLETES ARE UP IN ARMS.
Five Thousand Eudeavorers Declare
Their Ability to Carry Their
Point.
HAYWARDS, Cal., March 31. â The
Christian Eudeavorers of this city threw
down the gauntlet to the athletically in
clined^ last Sunday night when they
adopted ' strong resolutions Â protesting
against the proposed athletic park. From
now on the two elements will contest for
supremacy until one' or the other gives up
and acknowledges defeat. 7 r
.This action is as sudden as it is surpris
ing, and the friends ofthe proposed recrea
tion; grounds are trying to find out just
where they arc at. The idea had -been
received with great favor up to this action
of the Endeavorers, and it seemed to be in
a fair way to be realized. .It ; may be
realized yet, but still there is now to* be a
contest if the project is carried forward.
â¢ : The idea was to establish an athletic
park where all kinds of athletic tourna
ments might be held, such as bicycle rac
ing, â  football contests/baseball games,
track and field athletics, etc. It is believed
that it would be the means of attracting
large crowds to the town who would spend
money with the local merchants. The re
sult would be that times would materially
improve and the town would be known
wherever athletes congregate, \
. There are three good-sized Christian En
deavor societies in the town, one each in
the Methodist, Presbyterian and Congre
gational churches. i These young people
see in the proposed athletic grounds ' only
Sunday desecration j and temptation to
beer and whisky drinking for young men
and young o women, and 2to : even worse
things. They have declared against any
such action and will leave no stone un
turned to defeat the proposition.
Just what their success will be remains
to be seen. They are confident, however,
of ';', winning and;- ; refer .to . what, ,at
San -Lorenzo, only a few miles away, the
Christian Endeavorers in /one; small so
ciety have done in opposing as powerful a
corporation as the Oakland, Ilaywards
and : San Leandro Railroad. That com
pany is "the owner of a fine recreation
grove at San Lorenzo, but cannot lease' it,
as the applications for permits to secure
liquor licenses have all been successfully
protested. --
â¢'Some: six months. ago Fred Bormann
i filed an . application^ with the Board ot
j Supervisors for a liquor license, but the
Christian Endeavor Society of /the local
: : church,: led . by their pastor, Rev. George
' T. McColium, began a campaign of resist
i ance that has succeeded in 'knocking out
! their applications. '- , " â¢ ... *
... The fourth was filed with the board Yes-
I terday and is likely to meet a similar /ate.
| ..This has encouraged the Haywards society
i to believe that it can by united effort keep
! the town from, being any worse than it is
|in the way of a Sunday resort. 7 .- .. / ; .
. It is possible that the local societies will
i appeal to the Alameda County Christian
! Endeavor Union, for moral and financial
! support. "â¢â¢'. This latter body has over 5000
! members and : all are strongly opposed; to
: anything that will make Sunday a'pleis
i ure day rather than a day for ; rest and
| worship. The subject/ is one that will
j enlist their sympathies/ and support in
I every available manner. â¢
The result of this unique contest will
be watched with great interest by all inter
| ested *on ;, cither side of the question
throughout the county. .

MAY INDICT WILLIAMS.
Probability That the United
States Grand Jury Will
Hold Him. ;
Collector Wise Making a Desperate
Effort to Save the Customs '
Inspector.
The belief is ceneral in Federal circles
ihat the United States Grand Jury will in
dict Richard "Williams. That body met
yesterday afternoon and likened io testi
mony in favor of the accused inspector.
He is char ed with aiding in the unlawful
landing of Chinese at this port, and the
testimony against him comes irom Chinese
witnesses. " , â 
Special Agent Moore of the Treasury
Department has presented to the Grand
Jury certain evidence which shows that
Williams, during his brief connection
with the Chinese Bureau, has acquired
considerable of a fortune. His property,
so the Btorv goes, was mostly in the name
of Henry Monferan, his stepfather. Mon
feran was a window-cleaner. His body
was found in the park a few days ago,
where he had shot himself. He had no
money on his person, and "Dick" Williams
was the only person who identiiied his
body at the Morgue. . .
Ail these incidents have been brought
to the notice of the United States Grand
Jury, and though Collector Wise labored
with the jury for several hours yesterday,
there is a strong presumption that he had
little or no effect upon the deliberations of
that body in regard to the Williams case.
Collector Wise is a most persistent per
son. He believes in the innocence of Wil
liams and will stand by him to the end.
It is said by the knowing ones that Moore,
who is turning heaven and earth to down
Collector Wise, has thus far succeeded in
convincing the Grand Jury that the in
spector should be tried before the Criminal
Court for his alleged shortcomings. But
the ultimate conviction of Williams is an
other story. He is a game fellow and has
-strong friends who will not desert him.

JUDGE TROUTT
RULED RIGHTLY.
Opinion of Chief Justice
Beatty in the Hawai
ian Case.
â â ". -
THE DEFENSE SET BACK.
Important Victory Gained by
the Attorneys for the
Plaintiff.
LOWER COURT IS SUSTAINED.
Citizens May Be Restrained From
Prosecuting Iniquitous Suits in
Foreign Courts.
Another and very important, victory was
won yesterday by the plaintiff in the case â 
of Claus Spreckeis against the Hawaiian
Commercial and Sugar Company, Russell ;
J. Wilson, Mountford S, Wilson, Charles
S. Wheeler, Rudolph Spreckeis and B. J. <
Hoff acker.
This victory was the denial by the Su- '
preme Court of an ex-parte motion by the ,
defendants' attorneys for a writ of prohi- j
tion to prevent Judge Troutt from pro- j ;
reeding further in his refusal to order the i
temporary injunction dissolved after hay- j
ing overruled the defendants' demurrer to j ,
the complaint and having derided against '
the contention of The defendants that ;
Judge Troutt had no jurisdiction in the |
case. . â ';; .'..'. ;"'?;""'.'
All that the defendants can do now is to '
abandon the contest or make a direct ap
peal to the Supreme Court. ,'".
In denying the ex-parte motion of the I
defendants the folio wing "was handed down
by Chief Justice Beatty : ,
Rale to show cause denied, upon the ground
that the right of petitioner to appeal from
the order granting a preliminary injunction,
or from the order refusing to dissolve the same, 'â¢
affords a means of testing the power of the court "
to grant the same, anil appears to be a plain,
adequate and speedy remedy for any wrong or
injury sustained thereby. .
The opinion of Judge Troutt, which the
Supreme Court has sustained, is expressed
in its title: "Opinion of Hon. James M.
Troutt; of the Superior Court of the City
and County of' San Francisco, delivered
March 12,1 356, maintaining the power of
courts of equity to restrain citizens from
prosecuting iniquitous suits against other
"citizens in foreign courts." * 'â¢*'
It is an opinion which will be quoted as
a precedent in similar cases, j In his deci
sion Judge Troutt 3ays: .:..:';
To use the language of plaintiff's counsel,
"When the Civil Code was adopted the Legis
lature established the law in this State for the '.
governance of the people of this State. It was
not concerned in protecting the dignity or en- '
lureing the jurisdiction of the 'courts of Ha
waii, of New York., or of England. It was con
cerned in the protection of citizens of Califor
nia from wrongs threatened or carried on by , â¢
other persons, whether citizens or not. The :
State owes this protection to its citizens in re-" "
turn for the support which the citizens give
to it." y"yy '"'.-.'â â . v ;'.'â "
The concluding : paragraphs of Judge
Troutt's opinion, delivered on March 12,
are as follows:
And now, in determining whether the de
fendant's demurrer, hhoiild be sustained or
overruled, the court must assume, in the face j
et the admitted facts, that the .land In con- j
troversy: is not held by the plaint's in trust)
lor the defendant corporation, and hence that
there was no occasion for said corporation to
commence its aforesaid action against plain
tiff, and that in tlie light of all the circum
stances and facts as alleged in plaintiff's com
plaint, the said corporation ought not in
equity and good conscience to be permitted to ,
maintain and continue its aforesaid 'action in i
the courts of the republic of Hawaii. "V 2
Hence, it is the opinion of this 'court that the
preliminary injunction heretofore granted
should be continued in force until by trial of
the cause", it shall have been determined
whether or not the facts established by the evi
dence then adduced may justify the court in
permanently enjoining the deiendant from
prosecuting the Hawaiian suit. ;
Accordingly, the demurrer is overruled, with
leave to defendants to answer within ten days,
and the motion to dissolve" the temporary in
junction is denied. ':y : }--J:'" ; ~
The setback which the counsel for the
defendants received is emphasized by the
fact that Delmas & Shortridge, counsel for
the plaintiff, were not present when the
application \ was .made to the Supreme
Court. The defendant's attorneys told
their story in their own way, and were
ruled against on their own presentation of
the case. . ' .-â¢'"': ' .;â *"â¢" '' - 'â¢â¢â¢'..
FOSTER IN CONTEMPT.
Judge Seawell Gives Him Twenty-Four
Hours in the County Jailâ A
Stay of Execution.
, A. W. Foster, president of the San Fran
cisco and North Pacific Railroad, has been
adjudged guilty of contempt of court and
has been sentenced to twenty-four hours in"
jail. ."_-.' --'".*'â¢" ""
This citation of contempt is the outcome
of the suit of Sidney V. Smith for the po
sition in the directorate occupied by:P. X.
Lilientlial. Judge Seawell recently de
tided that Smith was; the legally elected
director, and that; Lilienthal was erron
eously installed in office: ' After the decis
ion Smith presented himself at the next
meeting and J he .was refused admittance.
Judge Seawell had granted an injunction
restraining tne other directors from inter
fering with Smith when he Came to take
. possession, but . Foster braved tne charge
of contempt when Smith presented him
self, and . on that point Judge Seawell
passed Upon him. Â
. in rendering his".decision Judge Seawell
said :â '-'.-â¢â¢ ,
- The primary purpose in this case was to de
clare who was elected a directorâ Smith or
Lilienthal. It was not a proceeding to oust
anybody, and my idea in granting an order of
in junction was that without such the court's
judgment, could be disregarded. The judg
ment of the court was not that Mr. Smith in
entitled to anything but that he is a director
Now the effect of an appeal is always limited
to the force of a judgment, but does not im
pair its character. Now. the character of this
judgment was the determination that Smith
Highest of all in Leavening Power.â Latest U.S. Gov't Report

ABSOLUTELY PURE
was actually elected and is ; now a director.
Therefore, there could be no proceeding by
way of execution to enforce such a judgment.;
Lilienthal . never was a ; director, the court
finds; Smith was. even before the, decision ln
bis favor, and so he had a right ito take his
seat as a matter of course. : - : .
- Mr. Foster refused to let him take his seat.
Now, if I find Mr. Foster guilty of contempt,
what remedy has the petitioner, Smith, got?
Whereas, if ''adjudge Mr. Foster guilty of con
tempt, mv decision is subject to review . in â  the
Supreme Court. 'Mr. Foster acted in no con
tumacious spirit, but in good faith and under
the advice of counsel. But I find that he Â»as
guilty of contempt of this court, ana the judg
ment of the court will be that he be impris
oned in the County .Tail for a term of twenty
four hours. Counsel for Mr. Foster will, of
course, be granted a stay of execution to en
able them to prepare papers on appeal. â  'â¢"".
I will say that I have my doubts as to the
correctness of mv reasoning in arriving at this
conclusion. I regard It as a highly debatable
question; bntl feel it my duty: to decide as 1
do in the interests of simple justice.
The case will be taken before the Su
preme Court at once and a stay of execu
tion until to-morrow was granted to allow
the aopeal. -â¢ â . â¢-â¢ 2y-' â¢

and took the 5:15 o'clock train for Palo
Alto.
After appearing in San Jose, San Fran
cisco and Oakland the boys gave , concerts
in Pasadena, Riverside. Santa Ana, Red
lands, Los Angeles and Fresno, the last
two towns being visited twice. .
The twenty-five musicians' were unani- j
mous in their praise of the hospitality of
the people of the southern part of the
State. Everywhere they were received !
and entertained royally, their advent in a ]
town being made the occasion of a society j
event. "â ; " ' , - - ; "â¢â â 
But financially the trip was not a suc
cess. The expenses of the entire tour ex
ceeded the receipts by $300. A large part
of the loss was caused *t the very outset
through the small audiences in this City
and in Oakland, due partly to late adver
tising. " " 'â :
The Stanford manager said that the
traveling. expenses alone amounted to over
$600. , Living expenses were nearly $400.
Then advertising and rents formed another
large item. . _'...': "â¢' â¢ . '"J
He took consolation in the fact that the
Berkeley Glee Club lost $600 on its South
ern California tour made last year.

dent that the telephone girl maintained a
discreet silence. \ .' :\..'--J %
." Shortly after 6 o'clock Monday afternoon
people who noticed other people would
have observed a fall, slender young woman
ofthe blonde and demi-monde type slowly
pacing up and down Jones street, , from
Geary to O'Farrell. Occasionally the
young woman cast an anxious, expectant
look around her, but not observing the
object of her quest continued to thread the
hall-deserted thoroughfare.
Shortly after the: tall blonde put in an
appearance, 'a v little - black-eyed, black
haired I woman, : heavily veiled, came
around the southwest corner of Geary and
Jones streets and taking her stand in the
shadows .watched'- the trim figure across
the way. The last, comer wore a half
sealskin cloak, underneath which she im
prisoned her right hand, as though she
desired to conceal something within its
grasp. '"..";..Â» â  . '. â -".- â¢â¢'
Almost simultaneously with the appear
ance of the black-haired woman a man
came up Geary street from the direction of
Powell. Just us ' he-reached the bake
shop, some three or four doors from Jones,
he caught sight of the woman in the seal
skin cloak, and without waiting to ask
any questions fled precipitously in the di
rection from which he had come. * - /
This performance' was not observed by
the woman of raven locks nor she of golden
tresses, but as the hour of 6:30 was at r
hand the former ..determined to make a
breakâ she did. " " * ' *
: â¢'â¢ Hastily:; crossing the street, .she made
directly for the woman of serpentine figure
and flaxen ; hair. % But the iatter was not
to be caught napping. She saw an angry
woman coming, and with ( the utmost dis
cretion beat as hasty a retreat as her skirts
would allow,' and Hearing, the . Signal Ex
press Company's office she made : a -flan It
movement by fleeine directly to the mid
dle of the street. ? *
: If the blonde hoped by this to throw her
pursuer off the track, the, next moment
dispelled such a delusion. ' >;.; '
.; The two * Women â the " pursuer and the
pursuedâ met face to face in the middle of
the street.
"How dare you,'' screamed the little
woman, "make . an appointment 'to ? : meet
my husband?"
"I didn't, I vow I didn't," tremulously
replied the other. : : , :.
: â¢'You lie, you know you lie," shrieked
the first. , "lake that, and that and that."
U And .with this last, the -'brunette drew
from beneath; her .; sealskin coat a horse
whip of no mean proportions and plied it
lustily on the back off her J supposed rival.
Down â { Jones street , toward i O'Farrell 1- tne
bright-eyed beauty fled, but she was not
alone, for the 'woman with the cowhide
was with her. The shrieks of the creature
of the half world drew a great crowd, and
at : the corner > kindly hands arrested .' the
stinging blows of her pursuer. ;
Down O'Farrell she -: seed as fast as ', her
quivering limbs could carry her, the won

.. So far as known the mysterious blonde
cuts no further figure in the case. ;
'â â  When the gaping; peopleâ those in the
street and those from the windows above
had looked upon the horsewhipper as long
as she cared to have them, she proceeded
to the butcher's and the baker's. and the
corner grocery-store, and at each of these
places related the story of her wrongs.
'â¢It s seems i. that she" is the i wife of Ed
Homan, a familiar figure at the Midwinter
Fair, but more recently acting as manager
of the Midway Plaisance. For some weeks
past, according to her story, she has had
occasion to doubt the marital honesty of
her husband, but, try as she would, could
never catch him in any direct violation of
these obligations.
:' Monday afternoon the telephone, that
wonderful little instrument with the
nickel-in-the-siot attachment, got in its
deadly work and Mrs. Homan found it
necessary to call up some friend over the
telephone, and to that may be traced di
rectly the severe horsewhipping of the
blonde-haired woman. \ -
.'..'. Mr. Homan; was holding a conversation
with the tall 'trim girl, and in some thor
oughly inexplicable manner the wires be
came crossed. > Mrs. Homan overheard all
that was said, and she forthwith made a
solemn promise to be present at the meet
ing. How faithfully she kept her word has
already been told. â¢'; .
The belligerent wife said her fanciful
husband lives at 8 Geary court, within
half a block of where the" horsewhipping
took place. . ' *
THE FLAG AFFAIR.
General Warfiold Explains the Alleged
;.â â â  Insult to "Old Glory" in Hon
olulu Recently.
Regarding the- report from Honolulu
that during a carousal of several young
men the American flag was trampled
upon, General Warfield, who has just re
turned from the islands, says:
"I heard of the occurrence while I was
in Honolulu, and from inquiry I believe
it was only the result of boy-play on the
part of Dr. Murray, a physician of 'hat
city, and three toitfists from New York.
All four had been roystering around all
day and -were 'burning' lots of .: , money in
the barroom of the hotel. One of the
party had a number of handkerchiefs dyed
with the colors of the American ensign.
"He began to decorate bis companions
with them; and Dr. : Murray, who is a
Canadian, t resisted the honor. Of course,
it was ungraceful on his part' in a room
full of Americans, but he was very diunk.
In the playful scuffling some of the hand
kerchiefs ; fell on the floor and were
trampled upon. -Lieutenant Elliot, who,
with several brother officers of the Ben
nington, were present, .saw the action oi
Canadian and .started: toward : him with
fight in his movements. A number of by
standers got between 'the two 1 men and
prevented Murray.: from : ; receiving what
would have been. severe whipping. He
is a small man and no match physically
for the big naval officer, and this, with the
drunken condition of Murray, kept Elliot
from striking him. v. , .
"Next day Murray, sober, did not re
member any detail of the affair, and said
if he had not been drunk he would not
have acted -so. But nevertheless quite a
number of Americans have resented his
churlishness, and he will doubtless "be
made to be very, sorry for the affair. The
published^ account of the occurrence was
not fair to the Bennington and the other
officers who * were present. y Under the cir
cumstances it would have been undignified
and { ungeiitlemanly â¢ to? have noticed the
insignificant affair."

BELVEDERE WILL
FIGHT SMITH.
People There Refuse to Be
Discarded by Railway
Consolidation.
WANT A NEW FERRY;
Contract and Bond Arranged for
, : a Service to the Island Â\
Suburb.
ELECTRIC LINE TO SAN RAFAEL
The Belvedere Company Supports the
Enterprise in an Encouraging
Manner. ''" '
The people of Belvedere, having become
alarmed at the possibilities of consolida
tion of the Donahue and the North Pacific
Coast railway* - , have taken a decided stand
for self-protection in the matter of trans
portation accommodations.
They have pursued no half-way policy.
After mature deliberation it: was : deter
mined to establish an independent ferry
service between San Francisco and Belve
dere, and this enterprise is to be backed
up by the Belvedere Land . and Water
Company to the extent of an electric
street railroad line to San Rafael from the
I wharf on its property! ' '' The matter has
gone even farther, for conditional arrange
i ments have been made with the owner of
a steamer on the bay to carry on a ferry
service between the City and Belvedere.
And that this accommodation might be
assured a large bond was exacted, and the
steamboat owner declared he was ready to
give the security demanded.
J. 1), Maxwell, one of the first men to
niaKe his home in the attractive seaside
suburb near Tiburon, has been an active
participant with the ' other , residents of
Belvedere in this; movement for an inde
pendent means of transportation across
the bay. : He says that all his neighbors
are " fully determined \on what they shall
do in this regard, for :it is either a clear
case of success in the venture or ruin of
their homes, which now . faces them
through Sidney V. Smith's scheme of con
solidation.
22 "None of us wish to appear as in opposi
tion to Mr. Foster of the Donahue road,''
he said yesterday. "Mr. Foster has done
a great deal -for us, and we in Belvedere
are well pleased with his attention to our
interests. 1 . It < seems, ' however, th at Mr.
Smith may play a winning card. Some of
the more timid; people fear* he may win,
in which ; case we ot : Belvedere would be
left;-: out lin the cold. : We all ; saw that
something had to be done in the matter to
protect ourselves, and so we caucussed and
discussed the condition that faced us and
is still before us. It did not take long to
find what we wanted, r * ,
"-"We, that is the Belvedere Improvement
Club, made arrangements with the owners
of a steamer to give us a service that would
meet alt requirements for the same rate as
we are paying on the Tiburon ferry.*;: Tne
steamer people have agreed; to give us a
bond -of . $20,000 :-. that]; tne service will be
maintained - according to contract, so that
we have a guarantee already of everything
we need for transportation. ,
"There was a stipulation in the contract
that we build a wHiarf or landing at Belve
dere. This was submitted' to the Belve
dere Land and : Water Company, and they
agreed to construct a commodious landing
and extend the road down to it. IS The com
pany: was so pleased with the idea that it
forthwith stated its intention of building
an electric ; line from the landing through
Belvedere and on to San Rafael. Estimates
of cost; etc., were obtained and it was seen
that the electric system was quite feasible,
could ' ; be constructed i at- small cost and
operated economically and at a profit,
while the motors could be utilized for sup
plying ; Belvedere ? avenues and our bouses
with ; electric : light. y Such ?is the ? plan of
the company. 1 have no doubt the' electric
road would pay a nice dividend and at the

Belvedere ferry. _
"The steamer in question makes better
time than the boats on the Tiburon route.
We have the choice of two landing places
in San Franciscoâ one near Market street,
the other at the foot of Powell street,
where the Kearny street electric cars stop.
The time from Market, stieet to Belvedere
is twenty minutes, and from Powell street
fifteen minutes, whereas the other route is
thirty minutes. | The steamer's name is
not to be made public at this time for {rood
reasons, but it is about the size of the Gen
eral McDowell.
"Sidney Smith has stated in his scheme
for consolidation of the two railroads that
he would take, off the ferry-boats on the
Tiburon route with the exception of those
connecting with through trains of the
Donahue road, lie would have everybody
travel to and from San Rafael via Sausa
lito: That plan would utterly ruin Belve
dere, for we should then have to move our
houses and come to San Francisco or go to
Sausalito. We have spent considerable
money in Belvedere and consequently we
do not propose to be set aside by Mr.
Smith's plan of economy. We propose to
run the Belvedere ferry at times through
the day when the Tiburon boat is not run
ning, and by that means have a service
which cannot be taken away by rival rail
roads." ". ' Â"â  *.* â â  â  : â¢
