MANY BIDDERS
FOR THE BONDS.
Men of Nearly Every State
Offer Gold to the
Treasury.
SUCCESS OF THE ISSUE.
Hundreds of Millions Placed at
the Disposal of Secretary
Carlisle.
SMALL OFFERINGS NUMEROUS.
Fifty-Dllar Bids Mingle With Those
Representing the Amount of
the Entire Loan.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. s.â Bids for
$100,000,000 thirty-year i per cent United
States bonds were opened at the Treasury
Department at noon to-day, . under the
conditions prescribed in the circular issued
January 6 last by Secretary Carlisle.
The bids were opened in the room of
Secretary Carlisle. A large table was
placed at the south end of the room over
looking the Potomac River and the Wash
ington monument, as which sat Secretary
Carlisle, Assistant Secretary Curtis and
several clerks. In front of the desk were
placed a number of chairs, and every seat
was taken by those who had come in person
to present bids and many were compelled
to stand. Hundreds of millions of dollars
were represented. Nearly all those present
bs bidders came from New York, but there
was a sprinkling of financiers and brokers
from Chicago, Cincinnati and other West
ern cities.
A large tin box was placed on the table
shortly before 12 o'clock. It contained
the bids. They were done up by days and
upon each package was marked the date
on which the bid was received. The
Treasury Department ' was simply over
whelmed by the enormous number of bids
received. With fifteen expert clerks at
work scheduling the bids at 6 o'clock to
night, they having worked incessantly
Eince 10 o'clock this morning, 1200 bids re
main unscheduled. They will be copied
to-morrow.
The great feature of the bond bidding
was the offer of J. P. Morgan's 'syndicate,
wl^ich. ! as now composed, includes only
hi'j own banking-house, the Deutsche
Bank lof Berlin, Germany, and Harvey
Fiske & Sons of New York. They pro
posed to take the entire '. issue at 110.6377.
Only one other bid of anything like that
amount was received.
Pierpont Morgan, after figuring on the
bids received, said to-night that he estima
ted that he would be awarded on his bids
about 60 per cent of the $100,000,000. He
reached this conclusion simply hearing
the various bids read, as he did not think
that more than $40,000,000 bids above that
figure had been made. Scarcely more than
one-third of the actual bids received are
included in the imperfect list now pub
lished. Several thousand bids below the
obvious limit of acceptance are omitted.
Bids for many millions of dollars came
from New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Penn
sylvania. Texas, Illinois, Connecticut, Ver
mont. Maryland, Nebraska, Missouri,
South Carolina, North Carolina, Indiana,
Michigan, Louisiana, Washington (State),
lowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and, in fact,
nearly every State of the Union thrown
into the most incongruous state of juxta
position, and quite a number of offers
from Canada were received at prices rang
ing from 109 downward.
The number of small bids was quite re
markable. The $50 offers ran up into
the hundreds and it fairly good prices,
and over 1000 small'Tianks and private in
dividuals, whose offers at the highest rates
of acceptability ranged from $500 up to
$8000 or $9000, are not included in the list
published. The offers by â¢ the class of
small bidders below the 110 and a fraction
.limit, which it seems shut off the issue, were
still more numerous. An encouraging
feature in these oners was that so many of
those of large amounts, ranging in many
cases up to one or more millions of dol
lars, came from fiduciary institutions
which thereby indicated ; that they had a
better outlet for their money than that
afforded by the United States bonds at the
price at which they will undoubtedly be
awarded. .-
One of the curious incidents of the day
was the fact that the bid of the Union
Trust Company of New York for $76,000,
--000 at 110.075 almost escaped notice in the
monotony of ; the reading, while the bid of
the Morgan syndicate was -received with
applause. .
Secretary Carlisle said he was extremely
â¢ gratified at the response of the .people ; to
the Government's appeal for subscriptions
to the bond call. It simply showed .that
when the people were appealed to they
would not fail to properly respond.
J. P. Morgan & Co., the National City
Bank of New York, the Deutsche Bank of
Berlin and Harvey, Fiske & Sons of New
York bid as a syndicate for $100,000,000 of
the bonds at 110.6877. - This was the
largest amount included in any one bid.
The total number of bids was 4640, ag
gregating $684,269,850, but one bid of $100,
--000,000 from a physician in Michigan and
one of $16,000,000 from Texas are evidently
bogus, and deducting these amounts leaves
the aggregate. of genuine bids $563,269,850.
The bid of Joseph Pulitzer of New York
for 51,000,000 at 114 had a memorandum
attached to it stating that this bid at .the
highest market price to-day is in lieu of
the offer to head the list with" a subscrip
tion of $1,000,000 to a popular loan, oh the
basis, which was riot adopted, of ,an' open
subscription at a fixed and equal rate.

RIVALS FIGHT A DUEL
Aspirants for a Woman's Love
Attempt a Settlement With
Pistols.
Both Are Badly Wounded, and Two
Bystanders Stop Stray
' Bullets. â 
GREENSBURG, Ind., Feb. s.â John Lee
and James Bostic, rivals for the affections
of a young woman of Adams, a quiet little
town five miles west of here, attempted to
settle the matter with pistols yesterday,
and both of them are badly wounded,
.while two bystanders ,also received stray,
bullets. . ' "
Bostic accompanied a young lady home
from church several weeks ago, when she
was insulted by Lee. A quarrel ensued,
and in a short while Lee had won the
young lady's affections. She was engaged
to Bostic and their wedding day was. set.
but she broke the engagement and* was
shortly to be married to Lee.
Bostic was drunk last night when be met
Lee. They quarreled and Bostic threatened
to . kill rival. ;> An hour later Lee was
among a group of friends in' conversation,
when Bostic shot at him,, firing ten
or twelve times. ' Lee drew his re
volver and fired ' several "- times,
shooting his adversary in the .arm
and shoulder and seriously, wounding
him. Lee was shot three, times, once in
the head, once just below the heart, on the
left side, and in the thigh. He . will die.
A ball from \ Bostic' s revolver struck a
store building and glanced, striking Vol*
ney Cline, about sixty feet away, in the
thigh and seriously wounding him.
The trouble occurred in front of Hazel
rigg's , drugstore and the glass was shat
tered by the bullets. A little girl standing
in the store was shot in the cheek by Bos
tic, but the wound is not dangerous, the
ball barely plowing inside the skin. . Sev
eral other men and women were standing
around Lee, but fortunately they escaped
injury. Great excitement prevails there,
and the Sheriff and posse are after Bostic.
Public sympathy seems to favor Lee.

of a Building and Injuring of

CHICAGO, 111.. Feb. s.â Persisting in
his attempts to; solve the secret of flash
light powder manufacture, F.T. Dunning,
an employe of the firm* of. Powell & Lau
rence, photographers, at Yale; and ; Sixty
third streets, Englewood, succeeded this
morning in causing an explosion which
wrecked the building in which the studio
is located, severely injuring himself and
Mrs. Laurence.
Mr. Laurence is the inventor of the pow
der, and has confided to no one the secret
of its composition. He employed Dunning
merely to mix and pack the material. He
was working with two and a half ounces of
the powder when it ignited and exploded
over two pounds of the stuff in thirty-six
boxes near by ready for shipment.
The room is in the second story and the
explosion tore a door from another apart
ment, hurled it through a hall and struck
Mrs. Laurence in the head. Dunning was
found unconscious, covered \ with debris
and bleeding from a â¢ dozen gashes. Mr.
Laurence was in the gallery on the first
floor, where the falling debris almost buried
him. The lives of all^ the occupants were
saved by the walls not collapsing. â¢'
i This is the third explosion. in the gallery
caused : by. the flash-light powder, the sec
ond being yesterday." When the first one
occurred some weeks ago Mr. Laurence
was forced to jump from the second-story"
window and was seriously injured. Many
windows in the vicinity were shattered by
to-day's explosion.

When the Kilbrannan arrived off Cape

was thick, and there was a moderate breeze
from the westward. No tugs were sighted
and it was ; decided to come up the straits
ahead of the westerly breeze. The - wind
continued moderate until the ship was off
Race rocks, when it began to increase rap
idly, and orders .were given ' to shorten
sail. But the wind j increased at such a
rate that within ten minutes, and before
the. sails could be shortened, it was blow
ing a hurricane, and the vessel was rapidly
driven across the straits till off Dungeness,
when the ship quickly broached to. -
The wind -had continued until it was
now blowing a terrific gale, and it either
blew away or split all the leeward sails.
An effort was made to get an anchorage,
but was not successful, and the ship was
then kept off ,to j the .windward with the
hope .of making Port Towrisend harbor.
The vessel could not be handled well
without canvas, and she was kept well in

caught in a tide rip and quickly carried
ashore by it, piling up high and dry. She

PERRY, O. , T., Feb. s.â Considerable
excitement prevailed here to-day over the
efforts of the Santa Fe railroad people to
clear a right of way i through the city. It
is feared that bloodshed will follow.
The right of way has had many settlers

cently the District Court decided the many
cases between the railroad and the squat
ters in favor of the railroad, and fifty men
with moving apparatus commenced work.

Neighbors Who Call With News That

CHICAGO, 111., Feb. s.â Evidence of a
terrible tragedy was discovered this morn
ing in the house of Richard Kloettke, a
carpenter, at 207 Bortean avenue. A
neighbor want to the house to test some
work done, and found it looking like a
channel house. The whole family, con
sisting of seven persons, lay dead, with
ghastly wounds in their bodies, the victims
of murder and suicide.
The family consisted of Richard Kloettke
and his wife Kate, their. three daughters,
Mina, Anna and Emma, aged respectively
9, 8 and 7 years, and John and Mina
Kloettke, the aged father and mother of
Richard.
Richard had supnorted the entire fam
ily by his labors, but for a long i time he
had been able to find very little work arid
the family was "in a state of destitution.
When the house was searched this morn
ing after the tragedy no money could be
found.
Kloettke had evidently, become despond
ent on account cf this enforced idleness
and had murdered the entire family, end
ing with blowing out his. brains. All had
been killed by shots from a revolver, and
the weapon with which the murderous
work bad been done lay close beside Klo
ettke, where it had fallen from his hand
after the last fatal shot had been fired.
' Kloettke had been out of work ever since
Christinas. One pathetic feature of the
tragedy is that the neighbors called at the
Kloettke cottage this morning each' with
news of employment.

Accused by a Merchant of Harassing
His Employes and Injuring
His , Trade. ,
" OMAHA. Nebb., Feb. s.â The Wilson
women, who came here a few weeks ago
from Los Angeles, are in r trouble again.
Judge Powell to-day issued a restraining
order against Marie Wilson, Ruby Wilson
and the mother of both, directing them
not to enter and to keep away from the
store of R. S. Raymond, where P. J.
Burroughs is selling the stock at auction.
The women followed Burroughs here from
the coast, and have been annoying him
persistently. * ,
. Raymond applied for the . injunction.
He charged the women with having fre
quently visited the store for the purpose
of annoying his employes, and threatening
them, insulting them -and circulating
false and scandalous stories about the em
ployes and the ; plaintiff's business, and
hindering, preventing and persuading
customers from purchasing goods. -
.It is alleged that the women have har
assed the employes and prevented them
from performing their duties. It is also
alleged that the women have frequently
come to the doors and windows of the
store and have mocked, shouted at and
annoyed : the plaintiff and bis assistants,
and ; have made " themselves offensive by
word and deed.
' : This suit grows out of the sensational
episode which occurred in McTague'a res
taurant about two weeks ago, when Paul
Harris, a stranger in this city, struck Miss
Marie Wilson : and knocked â¢ her down,
afterward making â¢ his : escape in time to
avoid arrest.

at least $30,000. worth of : convict-made
goods, saying that other firms did 1 the
same. When asked if his foreman did not

that his firm did a business of $2,000,000 a

CHEERING NEWS
FROM GOEBEL
Passage of the Repeal Bill
Will Be Recommended
in Committee.
ACTIVITY OF THE LOBBY.
Every Possible Influence Is
Brought to Bear Upon
Legislators.
HUNTINGTON SEEKS TO DELAY.
Putting Off the Final Struggle Until
His Plans Will Have Been
Well Laid.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 5.â A meeting J
of the Senate Judiciary Committee was ;
called this evening by Chairman Goebel
for consideration of tbe proposed repeal of
the charter of the Southern Pacific. There
was no quorum present ana the meeting
was postponed until to-morrow morning
before the regular session of the Senate.
Surprise was caused by the fact that no
attorney appeared before the committee
against the bill. It is expected, however,
that the road will contest the bill hotly
before the committee in the morning. It
is said Senators Weissenger and Hays,
two Louisville Senators. will be among the
champion opponents of the bill.
Senator Goebel is frank to say that the
bill will be reported with the opinion that
it should pass.
It is not likely that the report will be
unanimous, but that the members will
stand 5 to 2 or 4 to 3 for and against reDeal.
The lobby has gotten in some good work
for its side during the last few days,
and, while no application has been made
by the Huntington party for a hearing be
fore the committee, it will be represented
nevertheless, and to some purpose.
The lobbyists have been , very close in
their attentions to several of the members,
and have brought various influences to
bear upon them. The result will be that
one member will champion their cause in
the committee more or less strongly as
matters develop, and will have the sup
port of one if not two of the others. It is
quite certain that the report will not be
unanimous, and there is some danger of
the bill being reported adversely.
Once reported to the Senate favorably,
whether the committee is unanimous or
not, if action can be had at once the bill is
almost sure to pass. Opposition will be
made in that body as well as in the com
mittee, but how real no one can say.
Huntington's managers are shrewd and
tricky, and will try to mislead the friends
of the bill as far as possible as to their
real intentions, which will only be known
when the "finish fight" comes. If they
can delay the bill in the Senate Committee
so much is gained; more delay in the- Sen
ate itself so much more gained. Should it
then pass the Senate and go to the House
their real and main dependence will be
shown, and if they can carry out their
plans the fate of the bill is sealed.
Should the bill Dass the Senate and go to
the House, it will of course be referred to a
committee. The committee to whom it
should go would be the Judiciary Com
mittee, but on motion it may be sent to
some other committee, such" as Railroads
and Commerce or Corporate Institutions.
When the opponents of a bill want to kill
it and are able- to carry their point, they
sometimes move to refer it to the Commit
tee on Public Morals or committees which
are not supposed to report till the last day
of the session. ...v- . . *
If tbe repeal bill goes to the Judiciary
Committee, or to it and another commit
tee jointly, then the Huntington fight will
be to keep it there until the close of the
session unless they find the situation
favorable to its defeat in the House, when
it will be allowed to come up and- a record
of rejection be made. â  ,*-J,
, The fate of the bill in the House will de
pend largely upon Speaker Blandford. He
is a roan of fine tactâ bold and conscien
tiousâ will, if the matter is left to him,
refer it to the Judiciary Committee. This
committee is, in the main, a good one.
Judge Flippin is the chairman, and he has
already expressed himself in favor of the
bill, and on various occasions advocated its
passage with his ; fellow-members. He is
safe for it and a strong man with bis fellow
coinmitteemen.
With him on the committee are J. H.
Rice, a Republican, who is a lawyer from
Litchfield, Grayson County, down on Mr.
Huntington's C. 0. and S. W. R. R. Just how
Mr. Rice stands as to this bill, it is hard to
learn, but if he represents the sentiments
of his constituents, he will certainly sup
port it. His county made a very liberal
subscription to the E. and P. R. R., and
again to the branch from Litchfield to
Owensboro, and they have received no con
sideration at Mr. Huntington's hands,
and have really reaped but little benefit
from his roads, as he takes all the profit
of their industry. *
â¢ J. B. Coffman is a Republican from Rus
sellville, Logan County, on the L. and N.
road; is. a lawyer by profession; non
committal as to position on this bill;
thought to be for it, though. He is a great
friend of Judge Flipping and is likely to
stand with him if he has no special inter
ests the other way.
A. J. Carroll enjoys the unique and un
precedented distinction of being the soli
tary Democratic representative from - the
city of Louisville. He is an old news
paper man, having served on the Courier-
Journal for some years. This is his fourth
term in the House. He was Speaker at
tbe last session and was the Democratic
candidate against Speaker Blandford at
this, opening. Mr. Carroll is a practical
politician and knows a good deal about
running a sawmill. â¢ Â»
Verge Clarg, Democrat, is a lawyer from
Bowling j Gr/.m .Warren County, on the
L. and N. Railroad." /He has been engaged
by that road several times in local suits.
There is no reason to think he will oppose
the repeal bill,
J. F. Bobbins, Democrat, is a lawyer
from ? Mayfield, Graves County, down on
one of Huntington's roads. He :is apt to
be very pronounced either for or against
the bill when it comes before his commit
tee. - It .is 'â * not known that the 'railroad
people have any bold oft â  him, and it is
very certain \ that \ his whole county is bit
terly opposed to anything Huntington ad
vocates. 7 His policy has â¢ sucked the"? life
blood of every enterprise started "in (the
county dependent on. ths railroad for ship
ping facilities, and driven the hearts of
the farmers to despair with- the tariffs for
freight on their produce..
M. C. Swinford (D.) is a lawyer from
Cynthiana, Harrison County, on Hunting
ton's Chesapeake and Ohio. road, the East
ern division of his Kentucky system. ; He
has been engaged in suits against tbe rail
road in times past, but lately had some
connection with it. How far his election
was due to that influence is hard to say.
Mr. Swinford is a conscientious and able
man and represents one of the most intel
ligent sections of the State and -can be
very surely counted for the right as he
sees it. " ;
W. H. Lyons (R.) is a lawyer from New
port, Campbell County. He was elected
from the county district. The Chesapeake
and Ohio has a bridge across the Ohio be
tween Newport and Cincinnati and aroused
a great deal of hostility on the part of the
committee by their course in securing
right of way for approaches, etc. Mr.
Lyons has always been warm in his advo
cacy of the cause of the people against
monopoly, and it is thought that he will
support the Goebel bill.
The Huntington lobby men are advised
on ail these points and ethers besides and
are cutting their cloth accordingly. They
will spare no effort to bury that bill in the
committee should it pass the Senate, but
they will find Judge Flippin and most
likely a majority of his committee hard to
control or influence. â¢;*' ;: '
BLACKBURN IS GAINING.

FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. The vote
for United States senator in joint assem
bly to-day was as follows: Hunter, 66;
Blackburn, 62; scattering, 6. Necessary
to a choice, 69. luu-~%
The greatest crowd that has ever at
tended a joint ballot was present in the
Senate chamber this morning. The gal
leries and lobbies were crowded and some
women were present at first, but their
fears got the best of them and they went
away. The greatest excitement prevailed
and the crowd was with aithculty pre
vented from pushing on the floor of the
House. .... .-'_ ...j^.-j'x;V
"When the name of Senator Hayward
was called he asked to be allowed to ex
plain his vote. ,He said he was for
"sound" money, but be was confronted
by a peculiar crisis. He was not moved
by a threat, but in order to secure the
gieatest good for the greatest number he
would vote for Blackburn. This announce
ment was received with great applause.
Senator Hayward has, therefore, voted
for a "sound" money Democrat. Senator
Holloway, who has also voted that way,
voted for Blackburn.
The Republicans held a short caucus to
night at which Lieutenant-Governor
Worthington was present. It is said that
Worthington, in a speech to the caucus,
asked for Hunter's withdrawal from the
race, promising that any other man who
was put up would be elected.
The Democrats also caucused, "Senator
Bronston made a speech trying to get
"sound" money men in line for Black
burn. He said if they would vote for him
Poore would cast the deciding vote and
elect Blackburn. The caucus was intended
to heal the breach between the "sound"
money men and the Blackburn forc^, but
failed to secure this result.

STUART IS STILL CONFIDENT.
Declares That Even Congress Cannot
Prevent the Advertised
Tournament.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. s.â ln order
to prevent the , series lof prize and bull
fights advertised to begin on the 14th inst.
near El Paso, Tex,, from being carried out
in the adjoining Territory of New Mexico
a bill was passed, on motion of Delegate
Catron (R.) of New Mexico forbidding
prize or bull fights in any Territory of the
United States or District of Columbia
under penalty of from one to five years'
imprisonment.
EL PASO, Tex., Feb. s.â When word
reached El : Paso to-day that the United
States Congress had taken a hand in the
suppression of prize-fighting and passed a
bill making it a felony in the Territories
gossip became rife concerning â¢ the great
carnival which is to take place near here
within the next two weeks. Dan Stuart,
when asked what effect the bill would have
upon his carnival if it became a law, said:
"None in the least. The English Parlia
ment may pass a similar bill to-morrow
and still the great carnival will go ahead
as advertised."
John J. Taylor of the firm of Look &
Taylor, who gave Mr. Stuart his cue upon
which the preparations have been made,
was seen and Mr. Stuart's statement was
confirmed. If those most interested were
disconcerted over the news they concealed
their feelings from those not on the inside.
Mr. Look is in Chihuahua, and reports
from him are said to be of a character to
mate the sports feel safe.
Upon the other hand, the Ministers'
Union and other parties opposing the
fights are confident that the legislation of
to-day ruins the last chance that Dan
Stuart had of keeping his word. They
claim to have positive . assurances that
Governor Ahumada will not, under any
circumstances, allow the fight in his State,
and] that the "neutral-strip" talk is ridicul
ous.
SPECIAL CARS CHARTER ED.
Southern Railway Official* Relieve the

ST. LOUIS, Mo., Feb. 5.â There is no
doubt in the minds of the local officials of
the Southern railways that the prize-fights
near El Paso, scheduled to begin February
14, will take place as advertised. The Iron
Mountain Railroad is in daily receipt of
telegrams asking that arrangements be
made to handle a large number of specla
cars to be delivered from Eastern and
Northern railroads and containing parties
destined to El Paso. In most cases the"
cars are chartered on the understanding
that they may be used as sleeping quarters
during the four days' contest.
It is now conceded that the fights will
take place in New Mexico, about twenty
miles northwest of El Paso. A letter
from Governor Thornton, stating that
there is no law on the statute books pro
hibiting prize-fighting in New Mexico
practically settles â  this question. '.'"

PHOTOGRAPHIC SURPRISES.
Rontgen's Discovery Rivaled by That of a
Professor in the Yale Sheffield
Scientific School.
NEW HAVEN,, Conn., Feb. s.âProb
ably nothing in recent years has caused so
much interest and ; excitement among the
scientifically inclined at Yale University
as the experiments of Professor Rontgen
with the peculiar photography :by means
of the cathode rays, for which no name
has yet been found. It was under the in
spiration of Professor Wright that Henry
A. : Bumsted *;B.Am instructor, in ; physics
in the Yale Sheffield Scientific School, be
gan a series of similar experiments which
â¢ have â ; had , results equally startling- He
succeeded in developing many surprising
things, and hopes to achieve even greater
results in the future. ; The photographing,
if it can be so called, was done as follows:
Professor Bumsted took his small glass
tube and elevated it a short distance above
an ordinary \ negative, which ' was ' held
shut up in an ordinary case. On top
of the wooden case he placed the object
to be photographed. He then turned on
the electric current from a battery ; near
by, which threw the rays into the glass
tube, which in turn cast them upon tbe
objects below. These rays pierced through
the glass of the tube l and brought the
wood of the case into the negative below.
The ' objects ; photographed were those
placed on top of the case, and the impres
sion was greater or less according to the
resistance offered to the rays. ->v .
Probably the most interesting of Mr.
Bumsted's experiments were those with
animals, and their success was of such a
nature as to open a possibility of future
discoveries in the human system that is
almost boundless.
Of course the point ibat mostly interests
the scientific mind is the practicability of
these experiments. Bumsted was asked
what he thought on this point and said: '
"I am naturally rather loath to say very
much on this subject, owing to the fact
that the discovery is so very recent. There
are a large number of discoveries made
which seem unsusceptible of improve
ment, and while I hardly think that is the
case in the present instance it may prove
to be so. All my experiments, you must
understand, were made with a rough and
ready apparatus, hurriedly constructed for
the occasion. Considering this fact, I can
not help but be gratified with the result.
If such an insufficient preparation can re
sult in experiments so interesting there
are naturally expectations that greater
facilities may give us still more satisfactory
results. There are several .changes that
suggest themselves to me already, and
there are probably others that will be dis
covered." * " -.â â .:. , â¢â â¢ i ". v =r.^
HUSTON IS A BANKRUPT.
The Ex-Treasurer of the United
States Goes Into Voluntary â¢
Insolvency.
Inability to Realize on Bank Paper
,- the Announced Cause of the
,: Failure.
CONNERSVILLE, Ixd., Feb. s.â Ex-
United States Treasurer J. N. Huston
made an assignment this morning for the
benefit of his creditors. The cause of the
failure 13 attributed to being unable to re
alize on bank . papers. ;. This ? notice ap
peared on the door of the Citizens' Bank
at the hour of opening this morning: -
Huston, having executed a voluntary
assignment for the benefit of his bona fide
creditors, the Citizens' Bank of Connersvills
lias suspended payment pending the adjust
ment of its affairs according to law.
â  James Mclntosh,
Trustee for the creditors of J. N. Huston.
. This announcement created the utmost
anxiety, and crowds of . depositors sur
rounded the bank, anxious to ascertain
the exact condition of affairs. Mr. Huston
is now confined to his bed by an affection
of the eye. To a reporter. Dr. Smalley,
Mr. Huston's physician, said :
"Mr. Huston has been in a critical con
dition for more than two weeks past. His
eyesight has almost failed him. The as
signment was hastened by the condition
of his health. His* creditors will be paid
in full. His assets are $300,000, while his
liabilities will not be over $105,000 at the
outside."

A MAEYLAND DINNEK.
What That Meal Was Like in the Good
Old Bays.
The following will give the reader who
has never enjoyed the actual experience
an ida of what the Maryland Club dinner,'
as eaten and digested by the members of
the ' older and original stock, really is.
We will begin our Maryland dinner with
oysters from Lynnhaven, Virginiaâ a step
which will surprise those who do not
know that six generations of surveyors
have been unable to indicate the frontier
lines between the two States, most prob
ably because (alack ! that this should have
been said before, and in Congress) there
are none. A : consomme is then to
be recommended, whereupon the
terrapin in â  real / / Maryland 7 style
is : ushered in with an air :of becoming
solemnity. ..; Upon t this mystery follows a
saddle of mutton from the â mountains,
which/will t have "hung" for two weeks;
and v then appears the second mystery of
the repastâ a i wfld duck, with; celery, and
hominy, which has first been boiled and
then friedâ the hominy, and not the duck.
Now do not be obstinate and insist upon
the. wild duck being a canvasback, if Tom
Whispers in your ear that the "hunter" of
the ( club/. writes to ; say that this ; peerless
bird is flying hi^h and" doing "poorly." A
good redhead or a baldpate, or even a mal
lard in good condition, is much better eat
ing i than \a ; canvasback which has '- been
doing poorly. ; :
As a matter of fact, the baldpate -better*
known: to the ornithologist as the shel
drakeâis the best \ eating duck. He : does
not seem to have the nice nervous organ
ization which worries the canvasback thin.
and | you : will understand <; his succulent
plumpness; his r easy-going, eatable na
ture, when : from your blind lor \ sink-box
you â  have watched = the rogue , steal the
crisp wild celery /which the diving canvas
back has spent an afternoon in : uproot
ing. Your feast should 5 conclude with an
Eastern Shore >â  ham, two \ years ; old, - and
baked a rich claret color, and then coffee,
cigars and liquors, accbjdihg to your fancy.
it The '*. wines with "which *. you", may decide
to discuss your dinner will be very .good,
wherever your choice may fall, but the
Maryland Club whisky and Madeiras can
not be found elsewhere, and : for the latter
you can offer almost any price and get not
get x a r bottle unless you % have ; not j only
friends at court, but luck. /The Maryland
Madeiras have much' in common with the
wines of Shiraz of which! the Persian bard
sang and the Falernian in which Horace
delighted. Your Baltimorean thinks of
them in the most Â» serious moment of his

SENATOR VEST
FLAYS MORTON
Bitter Denunciation of the
Democratic Secretary
of Agriculture.
SCOURGE TO HIS PARTY.
\ Declared to Have : Been Sent by
the Evil One to Settle
a Grudge.
A WOESHIPEB OF CLEVELAND.
Strong Words Called Forth by the
Nebraskan's Antagonism to 1
the Farmer.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 5.-In the
Senate to-day the joint resolution direct
ing the Secretary of Agriculture to carry
into effect the provisions of the agricul
tural appropriation for the current fiscal
year for the purchase and distribution of
seeds and farmers' bulletins was taken up
and discussed during the morning hour.
Vest (D.) of Missouri made one of his
characteristic speeches in support of the
joint.resolution, homing up the Secretary
of Agriculture to ridicule in connection
with the question and with the Secretary's
condemnation of the free silver movement.
"The Democratic party," he exclaimed,
passionately, '-has been most unfortun
ate, not only in the : dissensions
that exist in its own ranks, but in the fact
that, to use a Western phrase, the devil
has owed the party a grudge, and has paid
it in a Secretary of Agriculture. [Laugh
ter.] He has put the party to which he
belongs in antagonism to the great agri
cultural interests of the country, which
have heretofore been particulerly close to
the Democratic organization. The founder
of the Democratic party was the best friend
the agricultural interest ever had on this
continent. Mr. Jefferson, wnile Minister
to France, and while watching that great
drama of the French revolution, while
watching the court of Versailles feasting
and dancing as the mob roared like a wild
beast, found time, while corresponding
with the savants of Europe, to send seeds
and plants to this country."
â  Vest proceeded to point out other in
stances of Government extravagance which
had escaped the attention of the Secretary
of Agriculture,' instancing the eleven mil
lions of profit to the bond syndicate, the
enormous waste of public printing, and
the expenditure of $110,000 in one year for
orchids, lilies of the valley, and giant
palms for the White House.
"But," said Mr. Vest, "when it comes to
the poor farmers' seeds the Secretary cries,
'To arms! To arms! Congress is throwing
away the people's money and is ruining
the country.' I would rather give twice
the amount of this appropriation to enable
.some â¢poor man in a distant county in the
West who is fighting the hard battle of
life unaided by any Government, some
thing" that would make his home comfort
able and bring light to his fireside ; I would
rather put the flower in the sickroom of an
overworked girl or matron than have it
said that I voted $110,000 1 for flowers and
exotics for the receptions and bouquets of
the officials of ' the Government, where
the chandelier flashes its light across
the red wine : and ' the air is fra
grant with perfume like the spicy
breezes of ' Araby the Blest. Just
such tilings as this have caused the people
of this country to doubt whether this is a
Government of the people and for the peo
ple and to think they have no other rights
except to pay taxes to support a Govern
ment of the rich. No wonder we hear
such appeals as this coming from Wall
street." â 
Here Vest sent to the clerk's desk and
had read a paragraph from the circular of
a firm of Wall-street bankers and brokers,
stating that the Senate is the real obstacle
to currency and other reforms, and is
"sinking lower and lower in public esti
mation."
The Senator from South Carolina (Till
man), Vest said, had been denounced as a
communist, because he spoke of an incip
ient revolution in this country. But here
was a statement from New York bankers
that unless the Senate did the bidding of
the capitalists of the country, unless the
Senate adopted their â¢ opinions and policy,
a revolution was at hand and a convulsion
was coming.
. Vest turned from this point to aim more
shafts of contempt and ridicule at the Sec
retary of Agriculture, who, he said, acted
as if he were ; also the Secretary of War
and the Secretary of the Treasury. Mr.
Morton, be said, was a monomaniac on
the subject of gold. He saw nothing out
gold, read gold and believed that ( every
body who did not understand the question
as ?he did was a lunatic ' and ] ought to be
regarded "as a public enemy. He " could
not . confine | himself within % the limited
functions of his vegetable kingdom, but
was \ filling the country with attacks upon
those who could not see the money ques
tion in the same light as himself. Vest
concluded with a parting allusion to Sec
retary Morton ,- by saying: ' /_; ..
"He reposes by day ' and dreams by
night, occasionally swinging his ' golden
censor filled with incense at the executive
mansion and; shouting, , 'Holy, holy art
thou, O Grover, king of kings and lord of
lords!'" [General laughter on the floor
and in the galleries.] 7 â¢

REGRETTED BY- SALVATIONISTS.
They Mourn the Departure of the Booths
. From This Country.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 5.-The next
number of the War Cry, the official organ
of : the Salvation .' Army, will contain the
following editorial on the recall of Com
mander and Mrs. Ballington Booth :
"The lapse of a week has given us time
to think over and in some measure com
prehend the fact that our leaders have
really received orders to leave us for other
fields. Sorrow and regret are naturally
only limited by the boundary lines of the
â¢country. The tender associations,, the ex
periences of a thousand hard battles fought
and won during the past nine years, can
not be severed without a pang. -â ",'.
"But . such are numbered , among the
fortunes of war and accepted as such by
the commander and Mrs. Booth. Their
letter is manly, yet affectionate. It. will
cause the tears to flow, yet it is a clear
statement of the situation and contains
many statements which should be en
graved" upon the "hearts of our readers,
such as, for instance: 'We, who have re
quired obedience from others are our
selves obeying.' 'Others â¢ may come and
go; others may live or die, "but God lies in
your lives and ours forever and forever.'
'The army is not a man or a number of
men; it is not regulations or rules; it is
not form or methods, but it is something
far deeper it is God-given principles.' "
This letter was issued yesterday, the
Booths, referring to the attitude of the
Carnegie Hall meeting of Monday night,
thanking their friends for their good will,
but stating that they must obey orders as
good soldiers. .
UPROAR IS THE HOUSE.
The District of Columbia Appro
priation Bill Meets With
Defeat.
Opposition to the Payment of Money
to Sectarian Charitable Insti
tutions.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. sâAn un
usual and what was said an unprecedented
event occurred in the House to-day. A
general appropriation (that of the Dis
trict of Columbia) was defeated in a body
containing 150 majority upon the ; side
of the majority of the committee from
which the bill was reported by a vote of
143 to 135. The reason for this defeat was
was twofold; the Democratic minority
voted solidly against it, aided by those
Republicans who opposed the insertion of
any appropriations for sectarian and pri
vate charitable institutions in the District.
This result was secured amidst the most
exciting scenes that have been witnessed
on the floor in this Congress, and appar
ently out of all proportion to the import
ance, and magnitude of the matter in
volved; but underneath the surface the
feeling was prevalent that the influence of
the vote would be far-reaching in the ap
proaching political contest. " After a time
toe Republicans came together, upon a
motion by Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio to con
sider the vote, aha that was done. Then
the bill was recommitted to the Committee
on Appropriations with instructions to
revise the schedule of appropriations for
charities. . 'â â ',."â  -â 'â ?,'}[ "AX*-'.-
Before that motion was adopted Crisp
(D.) of . Georgia sarcastically congratu
lated the Republican majority upon its
capacity and competency to do the public
business, _ asserting that whatever might
have been the ' shortcomings and failures
of the Democrats, upon which the speaker,
when on the floor, had often reminded
them, they had never got into such a
state of imbecility that they could not
frame and pass an ordinary appropriation
bin. 7 : 77;.' 7^
The House began the consideration of
the report of the Committee on Ways and
Means, recommending \ non-concurrence
in the Senate free coinage substitute for
the bond bill passed by the House last
December. Dingley (R.) of Maine, chair,
man of the committee, speaking for two
hours, and at the close of his remarks the
House ; took a recess.Until 8. o'clock, at
which time the debate on the bill was
further continued.
â  Dingley (R.) said that at the proper
time he would move to non-concur in the
action of the Senate and to insist upon the
bill which passed the House. The -House
was entitled to some answer to the propo
sitions contained in its bill, and he took it
that the House intended to insist upon the
proposition as ,it had originally framed
them. 7 '/ '/;'. %?
J Dingley reviewed the financial opera
tions of the Treasury Department in the
past three years to show the necessity of
the legislation contained in the House
billâ the rate of interest on bonds
sold for gold to maintain the 'gold reserve
shall be reduced to 3 per cent; that the
proceeds of the sale of United States bonds
shall be used for no other purpose than to
buildup the reserve; and that temporary
deficiencies in revenues shall be met by
the sale jof certificates of indebtedness.
The House had a right, he declared, to
demand of the Senate that it concur in
the action of the House or repeal the act
of 1875, providing for the sale of bonds and
the maintenance of the gold reserve.
Discussing some of the reasons assigned
for advocating free coinage Dingley said
that the increased demand for silver
boned for from opening the mints was a
delusion and a - phantom. The "fixed
price," one other reason urged, had no
foundation in fact, he said. Taking the
argument of advocates of free coinage
alone, Dingley said the only relief from
the present, situation was in an interna
tional agreement for coinage. '
7 . The committee then rose and at 5 o'clock
on motion by Dingley, took a recess until
8 o'clock, the evening session to be for de
bate on the bill only, â 'Â">.,
The debate op the free coinage substi
tute was continued in the House in a
night session. Parson (R.) of North Caro
lina avowed his faith that the Republican
party would solve the financial question in
a way to give the ; largest possible coinage
of sliver consistent with the credit of the
Government. â Â .-ââ¢.â â -.
In the course of his remarks Pearson in
dulged in a sneer at the expense of South
Carolina for the part she took in provoking
the war of secession. - This allusion an
gered Talbert (D.) of South Carolina, w, o
declared in a state of great excitement that
South Carolina was right in the position
which she then took. ;, : :
"I am ashamed of any man who indorses
secession or the motives which lay behind
it," Pearson said. . .
7 j "I i indorse ; it,"' Talbert exclaimed. "I
indorse every, word of secession."
, "It has been said,' 1 - Pearson went on,
"that if hell ever breaks loose in this coun
try it will break loose 'in ; South Carolina,
and I believe it." â¢ â â '.'â . â¢â¢ >
' > The spectators in the gallery took sides
in | this angry altercation, applauding now
the' one and .then the other combatant.
Talbert * had * the ' last / word, declaring
that "South Carolina." never has been
whipped and never will be whipped."
7 When the excitement subsided Pearson
went on with his speech. Tbe House ad
journed at 10:35 p. m.

OOHOA'S FLYING MACHINE.

President Cleveland and Secretary Hoke

cations from Victor L. Ochoa, a Federal .
convict in the Kings County (j\. V.)
penitentiary. He has an aerial ma-
chine which be wishes to dispose of
and to give this Government the first
chance to secure it. His letter to the
President never reached that official, but
was referred to the Commiasiontr of
Patents, who did . not pass favorably
upon it, because its practicability had
never been proven. Ochoa stated that,,
as he was serving a three years.' term
in the penitentiary, he had no opportun
ity of testing the machine, but if given a
chance he will show that it will work sue-"
cessfully, in which event be thinks
he ought to be given his liberty.
He makes known his idea at this
time because of the belligerent attitude
of the United States toward Great Brit
ain. He wants the attention of Congress
called to his invention and states that it
will do away with battle-ships. He asserts 1
that his machine will go from 100 to 300
miles per hour and carry more than double
â¢its weight. He wants $25,000,000 for it and
thinks this an insufficient sum. but says

Ex-Convict.
BENT UPON LYNCHING.
Excitement Caused by the Return
of a Criminal Warned to
Remain Away.
HE ELUDES THE PURSUERS.
Seeks the Protection of the Authorities
and Is Sent Out of the
Country.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., Feb. 5.-The
Wildest excitement prevailed here last
night when a crowd of angry men searched
the valley for van ex-convict named Andy
Anderson in order to lynch him.
A number of men assembled near East
land station with a rope and noose at 7
o'clock and waited for the train on which
it was expected Anderson would come.
When the train arrived in Mill Valley An
derson was not aboard, but he was seen in
the San Rafael train going toward Alta,
a station on the line of the North Pacific
Coast road about a mile and a half from
Mill Valley.
When this word was brought to Mill
Valley a couple of men were sent to guard
the road leading from Alta station into
Mill Valley. On . other highways leading
into tbe valley were also stationed men,
with instructions to give a signal if An
derson appeared.
The feeling against the man in Mill Val
ley is most intense. About three months
ago he was arrested for attacking the
seven-year-old daughter of Henry Z.
Jones, a real-estate dealer in San Fran
cisco. At the time of his arrest there was
serious talk among the men about town of
lynching him and extra precautions were
taken by the authorities to prevent any
lawless outbreak. Anderson had his pre
liminary hearing before Justice Thomas
Fothell and was held to answer before the
Superior Court. In the higher court he
demanded a jury trial and the jury
brought in a verdict of simple assault, the
full extent of the punishment being ninety
days, which Judge Angelotti gave him,
saying at the time that the man deserved
a sentence to cover the rest of bis natural
life.
The verdict of the jury came as a great
Surprise and there 'â . were signs of disap
proval on all sides.
Anderson, during all the time he was in
jail, said that he would return to Mill Val
ley as soon as his time was up. He was
warned not to come back, but he said he
would if he pleased. His three months'
term expired on Tuesday and he was .re
leased, ile took a train to San Francisco
and' left the City to comeback to Mill Val
ley On the 5:15 p. M. boat.
Anderson was seen on the boat by a
number of Mill Valley people, who told
him that a mob was waiting for him. An
derson, according to his own statement
made to Deputy' Sheriff Magner to-day,
said that he left the San Rafael train at
Alta station and walked across lots to Mill
Valley and hid in the brush opposite the
railroad station and watched the mob that
was looking and waiting for him.
After the valley had been thoroughly
searched and no trace of Anderson found
the mob dispersed. W hen the men bad
gone to their homes Anderson crept out of
the brush and made his way to Grethel's
barn, where he crawled into the loft and
spent the night. In the morning he got
up and walked up the road to a restaurant
run by Fred Schluter.
When Anderson made his appearance at
the restaurant be created a sensation, and
a deputy sheriff was immediately sent for.
He took Anderson in charge, and, to
gether-with a deputy constable, brought
him into the town.
In a short time the report got about that
Anderson was in the valley and the men I
again assembled. Anderson was told that j
he had better leave town, and packing up !
his few belongings he was escorted to the j
train and once again all is peace.
Anderson is about 35 years old, and was
arrested not long ago for selling liquor
without a license. He was tried and found
guilty and served a term of 165 days in
the County Jail. He is better known as
the "flying squirrel," a title he earned by
attempting to teach the small boys of the
town how a squirrel' jumped from limb to
limb. Anderson climbed a tall tree and
was going through his act when a limb
broke and he fell to the ground.

An Appropriation of $50,000 Wanted Jor
_ T z>r *Â«*o*n,/ Purposes.
SUISLN, Cat.., Feb. 5.-T0 secure. an
appropriation of $50,000 to dredge'SubW
Slouch ..petitions have been numerously
signed in Suisun, Elmira, Vacaville, Dixon
and Winters. These petitions will be
taken to Washington by Edward McGetti
gan, chairman of the Board of Supervi
sors of Solano County; and accompanying
the same are valuable statistics which have
been secured by the Board of Town Trus
tees of Suisun, showing the vital impor
tance of having the slough dredged and
improved.
The amount of freight shipped via
Suisun River last year was 32,235,700
pounds, and if the improvements which
are advocated were carried out the amount
of freight and produce transported via the
slough would be over 100,000,000 pounds.
These figures are reliable, and the citizens
in northern Solano County are of the
opinion their request is one which de
mands early and considerate attention.
WOODLAND'S SALOON CRUSADE.
The Supervisor* in No Hurry lo Suppress
the Liquor Traffic.
WOODLAND. Cal., Feb. Notwith
standing the fact that the anti-saloouists
of this county have spent months of work
in securing a petition of 50 per cent of
the voters to call an election to determine
whether or not the saloons shall be abol
ished, and notwithstanding their alleged
statement that it was . no longer optional
with the Supervisors to shelve tneir petiti
tion, but was peremptory with that body
to call a special election within thirty
days after the petition was presented, the
county fathers to-day for the second suc
cessive time laid the matter over for one
month. In the meantime the saloon men
will test the constitutionality of the law in
I the courts.
The council chambers in the hall of rec
ords were crowded to-day. Although no
official action was taken, a member of the
board this evening informed a Call corre
spondent that at their meeting in March
they would in all likelihood determine to
submit the question to the people at the
next general election.
Crowds of men are discussing the matter
on the street corners to-night. .
GRAND LODGE OF DANIA
! Officers Elected and the Session
Closed at Watsonville
Yesterday.
Steady Growth of the Orderâ Several
New Lodges Instituted Last
Year. . .
WATSONVILLE, Cal., Feb. s.â The ses
sion of the Grand Lodge of Dania closed
here to-day. , The election of officers lor
the ensuing term occupied but little time,
but the matter of choosing a place for
holding the next session was interesting.
Six places were nominated and Salinas
was finally chosen. The next session of
the Grand Lodge will be held the first
Monday in February next at that place.
! Watsonville was "honored by the choice
of C. P. Jensen' for president." The other
officers are: Vice-president, O. P. Kield
sen of Sacramento; secretary, J. P. Koford
of San Francisco; treasurer, C. N. Beck of
San Francisco; marshal, H. P. Neilsen of
San Francisco; vice-marshal, P. C. Krogh
of Sacramento.
In a speech James Madsen. an ex-grand
president, presented a beautiful large pin
to the retiring grand president, H. J. T.
Jacobson, who is an - ex-Assemblyman
from Fresno. Mr. Jacobson has done
able work for the past three years in the
interest of the order, and it owes much of
its success to his efforts. He thanked the
delegates in a neat speech for their regard
and for their interest in the work of the
order.
At 2 o'clock a recess of an hour and a
half was taken, during which the delegates
accepted an invitation to visit the sugar
factory in a body. - They expressed them
selves as much impressed with tbe view of
the present gigantic operations and the
prospect of increasing wealth of this
valley. The visitors unanimously signify
their appreciation of their reception and
the constant consideration shown them by
all citizens. 'â¢
The vice-president is enthusiastic over
the increasing membership of Dania. He
says new lodges were formed last year at
Suisun, San Jose, and Lovelocks, Nev.
The ball last night was a great social
success. To-night the delegates are being
feasted and toasted at a banquet at the
Watsonville House, given in their honor
by the home lodge. They will leave to
morrow with many kind memories of the
Sugar City.
LAST OBSTACLE REMOVED.
Corral Hollow Directors â â  Secure an Im-
variant Right of Way.
STOCKTON. Cal.. Feb. 5.â A telegram
has been received by Woods & Levinsky,
announcing that the directors of the Corral
Hollow road and the owners of the land
known as the Crocker tract had reached
an agreement by which the road is given
the right of way for which a suit of con
demnation is now pending. This removes
the last obstacle to the completion of the
line as far as the -mines, and it will be
pushed forward with all possible speed.
The compromise comes, in just the right
time, as the graders had reached the edge
of the tract, with the track layers right on
their heels.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1896.
WOODCHOPPERS IN
DEADLY STRIFE.
Two Italians Fight in a
Lonely Gulch Near
Saratoga.
THEY WERE PARTNERS.
One Badly Wounded With a
Pickax, the Other Scalded
With Soup.
HOW THE QUARREL BEGAN.
Both Sides of the Affairâ of the
Men Will Probably .
Die.
SARATOGA, Gal., Feb. s.â News was
received in this city to-day of a desperate
fight between Italian wood choppers,
which occurred last night in a lonely gulch
in the mountains back of Saratoga. An
tonio Perez, one of the participants, is in a
critical condition, the result of an ugly
wound over the heart, inflicted with a
pickax by his companion, Gugliel Mana
Lorenzo. The latter was badly scalded
with the contents of a soup kettle, and is
confined to a room in the Saratoga Hotel.
Both men were employed on the ranch of
Dr. McGraw, six and a half miles from
Saratoga, and occupied the same cabin.
Lorenzo's story is that Perez went to
Saratoga yesterday and returned in an in
toxicated condition, bringing home some
cheese which was unspeakably bad. They
had some words over the quality of the
cheese and Perez became very angry.
While Lorenzo was bending over a kettle
of boiling soup Perez came up behind him
and thrust his head into the kettle. When
Lorenzo had freed himself from the kettle
he saw Perez reaching for a hatchet. In
self-defense he seized a pickax, and as
Perez came on struck for his heart. The
blow struck just above the heart and
made a terrible wound three inches in
depth.
â  This did not settle Perez. He came on
again, and Lorenzo then beat him over the
head with the blunt end of the pickax.
Perez fell to the floor, and supposing he
was dead Lorenzo started for Saratoga.
He sent word to Constable Haun that he
had killed his partner.
A posse was organized and went to the
cabin where the fight occurred. Perez was
sitting up and shouting for water. He
was taken first to Saratoga and then to
the county hospital. Deputy District At
torney Beasly swore to a complaint charg
ing Lorenzo with assault to commit mur
der. ,
It was at first thought that Perez' in
juries were necessarily fatal, but the phy
sicians at the County Hospital claim that
his chances for recovery are good.
Perez tells a different story. He claims
A that after the dispute over the cheese Lo
renzo took a stick from the fireplace and
hit him over the head. As to what hap
pened after that he has no , recollection,
but believes that Lorenzo stabbed over the
heart while he was unconscious.
MASQUERADE AT SACRAMENTO.
Two Thousand People Have a Most En-
joyable Time.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. s.â The fifth
annual masquerade bail of the Sacramento
Athletic Club, held this evening in the old
pavilion, was one of the most successful
affairs of the kind that has taken place in
this city for years. There were fully 2000
people in attendance, fully half that num
ber being masked. Despite the immense
crowd not one incident had occurred up to
midnight to mar the pleasure of the as
semblage, so perfect had all arrangements
been made. The committees having the

MARE ISLAND ACCIDENT.
An Oiler on the Baltimore Crushed and
Lacerated in a Shocking Manner.
VALLEJO, Cal., Feb. s.â Michael Han
ley, an oiler on the cruiser Baltimore, met
with an accident at the navy-yard this
afternoon that may cost him his life.
A lot of scrapiron taken from the cruiser
had been placed on a flatcar to be hauled
up to the steam-engineering scrap ' neap.
The car was to be hauled; by the small
locomotive, and just as it started Hanley,
who had assisted in loading the car and
was some eighty feet away, ran and caught
hold of the hauling bar, a rod connecting
the flatcar to the engine, with the i inten
tion of swinging on the front of the car.
Instead of landing in the car he swung
over the bar- and fell head -down to the
ground with his head close to the inside of
the carwheel. The axle and bed of the
car being within a few inches of the
soft ground crushed: his body \ and
head down in the mud and rolled
him over and over until the length of the
car had passed over his body, which
bobbed with bis feet and hands up in the
air as the weight of the car was lifted from
him. The right hand was a bleeding mass,
the wheel evidently having passed over
and crushed it. His face and scalp was
badly torn and lacerated, ; while the in
ternal injuries are supposed to be fatal.
The man was quickly picked up and
carried \ aboard the Baltimore, and from
there shortly after was taken to the hos
pital for treatment. The cries of Hanley
could be heard hundreds of feet away
while revolving under the car and while
at the hospital being treated. Hartley's
time had expired, and he was awaiting his
discharge. ' â 
HACKED WITH A HATCHET.
Terrible Plight in Which a Fort
Ross Wood Contractor
Was Found.
The County Physician Says It Is a
Case of Attempt to
Murder.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., ; Feb. s.â Fran k
Manson, a wood contractor at Fort Ross,
was brought to this city to-day and placed
in the County Hospital.
The unfortunate man was suffering from
several severe cuts about the head and two
deep gashes across the throat, and is not
expected â¢to survive. It is claimed by
Manson's friends that he has been de
mented for several months, imagining that
he was acting under the direction of
spirits.
At one time the spirits commanded him
to kill some one, and it is said that for
several days he roamed about the woods of
Fort Ross with a shotgun trying to carry
out the spirits' commands.
It was at length determined by his
riends to bring him to this city for treat
ment, but before this could be accom
plished the demented man, still under the
direction of the spirits, it is supposed, de
termined to take his own life.
He was discovered near his home bleed
ing from two deep slashes across the
throat, inflicted with a large butcher
knife and a bloody hatchet lying near, ac
counted for the cuts across the top of his
head.
From the nature of these' latter wounds
it seems almost ; impossible for the
wounded man to have inflicted them upon
himself, it: being stated upon good author
ity that any one of the blows necessary
to cause such wounds would have stunned
the man. A : -.; 'â /â 
The County Physician says It is a case
of attempt to murder, as self-infliction of
such wounds would be impossible. :
APACHES ON THE RAMPAGE.
They Fire Upon a Cowman From Am

FORT THOMAS, Ariz., Feb. s.â The
San Carlos Apaches are again on the ram
page. Sam Hinton, a cowman, while rid
ing along the reservation, was fired upon
from ambush at a point about fifteen miles
from San Carlos agency. He avoided the
shots and arrived safely at San Carlos, the
nearest station where assistance could be
found. All settlers in this vicinity are
confidently expecting an attack ,in the
near future.

JOSE ILARIO CONVICTED.
Consumption May Save Hint Front the
Gallows.
SAN DIEGO, CaiÂ», Feb. Jose llano,
the Indian who has ; been on trial for a
week for the , murder of Mrs. Anne Sand
rock in Mission Valley on October 5 last,
was found guilty by the jury to-night. The
verdict was that Ilario was guilty of mur
der in the first degree, but as the wretched
criminal is rapidly sinking with consump
tion a recommendation was made that his
punishment be fixed at imprisonment for
life. Judge Pierce set March 2as the time
for fixing sentence.
The evidence against Ilario was wholly
circumstantial, but so strong that the jury
could reach no other verdict than guilty.
The murder of Mrs. Sandrock was utterly
cold-blooded. The woman was past mid
dle ace, and lived alone in a little store at
the foot of the grade leading into Mission
Valley. She was seen about noon on Oc
tober 5 selling goods to a stranger who
stood near the counter. About 4 o'clock
of that day the body of Mrs. SandrocK
was discovered lying near the counter, her
head being battered with a club and her
throat cut. On the counter were several
packages wrapped up, and a scoop half
full of beans was lying near the scales at
the end of the counter, almost over her
head. A butcher-knife, which was recog
nized as belonging to her, was lying two
or three feet from her, covered with blood.
She was lying in a pool of blood, and close
examination revealed blood spots on â  the
floor leading into the rear room where she
slept.
In the rear room the club . was found
with :. which the murderous blow was
struck. Blood stains were ; upon it. The
room had been ransacked, and a purse con
taining Mrs. Sandrock's little savings had
been ; wrenched open and 1 the contents
taken. The purse was in a handbag, and
one or two little articles in this were also
missing. : . ,
Sheriff; Jennings and his deputies ran
down several clews before capturing Jose
Ilario, and ' investigation in his case
brought a number of circumstances to light
which pointed almost conclusively to his
guilt. Ilario was miserably poor, and
lived like a " wild beast in a hole in the
ground in the city park. He gave evidence
of being demented, but was looked upon as
harmless. ; â - â .?.â . â , â  :

: From the number of ; men who met i, last

ability shown by, several of the new play
ers, it now looks as though Stanford might
put a very respectable aggregation in the
field this season, f As yet there has been
no game played,' and until that is done
nothing definite can be judged in regard to
the ability of the new men. The : first
game will be played next Saturday. The
freatest ' need is for pitchers and catchers.
. t now looks as though Captain McLaine
would be compelled to do all the box
work for the team. Jeffs '98 and Osgood
'97 are the only candidates for catcher.
SENT TO JAIL FOR CONTEMPT.
A Prominent Resident of Highlands Re-
fused to Pay Alimony.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Feb. 5.â W.
R. Smith was sent to jail this morning for
contempt of court, and â¢ he will haye to
stay there until he concludes to pay his
wife $138 alimony, or until Judge Campbell
changes his mind, which is not probable.
Smith is a prominent man of Highlands,
and a short while ago . sold some land for
several thousand dollars, none of which
Mrs. Smith ever saw. The case went into
court and the Judge decreed that Smith
pay to Mrs. Smith $100 cash and $6 per
week until the court decided the case, but
Smith failed to pay and this morning,
when he started to make excuses, the court
stopped him and committed him to jail.
VICTOR RESERVOIR SCHEME.
Two Hundred Thousand Acres of Land
to Be Placed Under Cultivation.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Feb. 5.â
The first genuine step toward pushing the
Victor reservoir scheme to the front was
made this morning, when H. P. Sweet, of
Chicago, the president of the Columbia
Colonization Company, filed several trust
deeds, by which the land : to be improved
by the company is transferred to the Los
; Angeles Loan and Trust " Company. The
property o. the Hesueria Land and Water
Company with all its rights has also been
transferred. The amount of land to be
placed under cultivation is 200,000 acres.
Work will be commenced at once and will
be pushed rapidly ahead until completion.
HINCKLEY VS. HINCKLEY
San Bernardino Suit Which
Threatens a Rupture of
Family Relations.
A Prominent Young Attorney Charged
With Forgery Leaves the
City.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Feb. The
suit lately instituted in this city entitled
Sarah C. Hinckley vs. Nat B. Hinckley, as
administrator, promises to rupture family
relations and again bring to light the
downfall of one of San Bernardino's
brightest young attorneys and citizen.
Mrs. Sarah C. Hinckley lives in the East,
and is a sister of the late Frank B. Hinck
ley, who left considerable valuable prop
erty near San Bernardino City. In some
manner the estate owed Mrs. S. C. Hinck
ley about $4000, and Mrs. F. B. Hinckley
gave notes until such time as they could
be paid. Her attorney was E. E. Rowell
of the firm of Rowell & Brunson.
When the notes became due Mrs. F. B.
Hinckley gave her attorney the amount to
pay them with. In place of forwarding
the entire amount, he sent about one-third
and forged Mrs. F. B. Hinckley's name to
notes for the balance, and in turn forged a
receipt for the full amount from Mrs. S. C.
Hinckley. As each month went by he
sent interest money East.
When the forged notes became due Mrs.
S. C. Hinckley, after waiting, sent them to
an attorney in this City, who immediately
went to Rowell in regard to them. Seeing
that the game was about up, Rowell put
the attorney off and quietly left : the City
and has not been heard of to this day. It
was then shown to Mrs. F. B. Hinckley
how she had been betrayed and robbed.
Having paid the money, she declined to
acknowledge the forged notes, hence the
suit against Nat B. Hinckley, the admin
istrator of his father's estate. How it will
end is hard to conjecture, and in all prob
ability the contest will be a bitter one.
Orange-Packing in Full Blast.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Feb. 5.â
The orange-Dacking season has again
opened in San Bernardino County and
carload after carload of fancy fruit is being
sent out. Packers are sending guarantees
with their oranges that they are entirely
free from the effects of the frost that
played such havoc in some localities.
This they can safely do, as the frost cut no
figure in the orange belt of . this county.
The fruit has ripened nicely and is supe
rior to last year's crop.

FATAL ACCIDENT
AT COULTERVILLE
Peter Matsen Falls Two
Hundred Feet Into a
Chute.
UNDER TONS OF ROCK.
The Badly Mangled Body Was
Extricated From the Ore
Pile With Difficulty.
HAD BEEN MISSING TWO DAYS.
First Fatal Accident Among the Em
ployes of the Merced Gold
Mining Company. .
STOCKTON, Cal.. Feb. s.â News comes
from Coulterville of the horrible death of
Peter Matsen, a Swedish roustabout in the .
employ of the Merced Gold-mining Com
pany.
The company owns a number of mines
in that region and Matsen had. been in the
habit of going from mine to mine to do his \
work. . Yesterday afternoon, shortly after
4 o'clock, Al Carmen was taking ore out of
a chute of the Potosi tunnel when he dis
covered the body of Matsen. The latter
had fallen 200 feet into the chute and fif- ,
teen tons of rock had been dumped ,in on '
top of him. It is thought that Matsen fell
into the opening on Sunday, as he had
not been seen since that day and the rock '
was dumped into the chute on Monday.
The body was badly mangled.
The remains were dug out from under
the pile of ore and will be given a decent
burial to-day by the company. This is the

REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Feb. s.âThir
teen oil and gas grants have just been
placed on record, which have been as
signed to the California Natural Gas and
Oil Company, and apply to 2082 acres of
land on the coast side of San Mateo
County.
The contracts are drawn so that the
party of the first part grants all the oil
and gas in and under the described prem
ises, together with the exclusive right of
the second party to enter therein for the
purpose of drilling or operating for oil,
gas, water, etc., on the following terms:
Should oil be found in paying quantities
upon the premises the second party agrees
to deliver to the first party, in the pipe
line or at the wells, the one-sixteenth part
of all the oil produced and saved from
said premise?.
If gas only is found, second party agrees
to pay $10 to $50 each a year for the prod
uct of each well while the same is being
used on the premises, and the first party
shall have gas free of expense to light and
heat the dwellings now on the premises.
There is a clause which provides that if
no well is completed within one year from
date of agreement then the grant shall be
come null and void unless the second party
shall pay to the first party the sum of ($lO
to $100 are the amounts named in the pre
sent instance) for each year thereafter that
such completion is delayed.
. These grants were all issued about nine
months ago in favor of E. J. Beane, his
heirs or assigns, and they have been
assigned by Beane to the California Gas,
Oil and Land Company, a corporation, of
which L. L. James, 419 California street,
San Francisco, is secretary.
The company is now sinking a well on
the San Francisco Savings Union Tract at
Halfmoon Bay. It is reported that they
are down 700 feet and that there is a
seepage of one and a half barrels of oil a
day and a flow of gas. The prospects of
striking a good flow of oil are considered
very favorable.

SESSION OF THE CIRCLES.
Some Able Essays Read Before
the Catholic Educational
Union.
A Large Audience Present in Metro
politan Hall at the Second
Open Meeting.
The second opening session of the read
ing circles comprising the Catholic Edu
cational Union was held last evening in
Metropolitan Hall. As on the previous
evenings the large hall was crowded with
an intellectual audience. The various es
says read by members of the circles were
well received, while the musical part of
the programme was an artistic success.
In calling the meeting to order, Rev. J.
Byrne of St. Mary's Cathedral announced
that this was the second open session and
expressed a wish that the people who had
attended the first one would bear in mind
the work done by the Catholic reading
circles.
The session was opened with a piano
solo by Miss M. E. Coonan, who was cor
dially applauded.
Miss M. Driscoll of Cathedral Circle read
an essay on "The Dolores Mission." She
gave a pleasing history of the mission.
The benign influence of the Franciscans
and their church upon the natives was
tola in glowing language, and by way of
antithesis the essayist drew a dark picture
of ruin and desolation that fell upon the
scene when politicians "secularized" the
missions of California. The Franciscan
padres, she said, were the true pioneers of
San Francisco.
A vocal solo by Miss Theresa de Ber
nardi of Faber Circle was given in a voice
that called out enthusiastic applause. Miss
de Bernardi sang for an encore, "Because
I Love You, Dear," with considerable art.
"Dion and the Sibyls," an essay by Miss
Mary T. Lor.igan of Thomas Aquinas Cir
cle, was heard with much interest, for it
was a thoughtful literary criticism.
Frank McGlynn of Montgomery Circle
recited "Thanatopsis," and the audience
compelled him to come out twice again,
when he gave two of Eugene Field's char
acter sketches that made a deep impres
sion.
Miss M. Kennedy of Archbishop Rior
dan Circle read a very deep and gracefully
written essay on "Development of English
Language."
Miss Daisy Keane contributed . a pretty
ballad. She was well received and gave
an encore that received applause.
An essay on "St. Catherine of Sienna"
was read by Miss Christina Regan of
Montgomery Circle.
A vocal solo, "I Fear No Foe," by S. J.
Sandy of the cathedral choir, captured the
audience.
Miss Julia C. Coffey of Cathedral Circle
read a clever essay on "Idealism and Re
alism in Literature."
The essay went into an analysis of the
idealist and the materialist and their work,
and continuing the speaker said: ;
"Catholic women should not be turned
hither and thither by the thoughts of this
day. They have no reason to follow the
fleeting standards of the hour. . We have
the grandest model the world has ever
produced. For us the Madonna is- the
ideal of perfection. How beautifully she
has been honored by the painter, the
musician and the writer. We should ap
preciate the true value of the inheritance
of noble art, literature and music, which
is especially ours. Let us cherish our
noble literature."
The conclusion was that the idealist
who embodies the high principles of faith,
hope and charity is ever reaching outward
along the highways of progress, growth
and expansion, ever tending the thoughts
and inspirations of the human race toward
a higher, nobler and grander existence.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY V FEBRUARY 6, 1896.
LEGAL DECISION
FROM SANTA CRUZ.
City Treasurers Cannot De
posit Public Funds in
City Banks.
TWO POINTS AT ISSUE.
Custodians of the People's Money
Must Not Take Common
Risks.
THE CONSTITUTION jIS QUOTED.
Taxes Are Levied to Pay Government
Expenses, Not for the Benefit of
Speculators.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Feb. 5. -The ques
tion of the right of a City Treasurer to
make a general deposit of the funds of the
city in a banking-house was acted upon by
Judge Logan this afternoon in the decision
delivered upon overruling the demurrer in
the case of Robert Effey, Mayor, against
Charles E. Williams, City Treasurer. The
Mayor brought suit to stop the deposits of
city money in the City Bank. The defend
ant demurred to the complaint with the
view of stopping the . proceeding by that
legal method, but Judge Logan holds that
the complaint is at least good enough to
stand in court, and the defendant has ten
days to answer. The substance of the
decision follows: 7 7 ;
Two questions were presented. . First,
has the plaintiff legal capacity to sue?
Second, does the complaint state facts tuf
ficlent to constitute a cause of action?
Upon "the first point it is claimed that
the defendant is violating the law appli
cable to such cases in the disposition and
safe keeping of the public funds, and 1
am of the opinion that the Mayor, being
charged by the charter with the execution
of the laws, has a right to maintain, in
his own name, a suit to enforce the law.
Upon the second point it is claimed that
the defendant is unlawfully depositing the
city funds in the City Bank on general
depost. A general deposit in a bank is a
depost that permits the bank to use the
money deposited to pay it out to its cred
itors or to loan it for interest.
When the treasurer permits this to be
done he parts with the possession of the
money, waives the right to regain the
same money specifically from the bank,
has the same privilege as any other de
positor of drawing on the bank for the
amount deposited in any lawful money,
takes the same chances as any other de
positor in the solvency of the bank ; and,
if it fails, to lose the money like any, one
else. In other words, it is a loan from the
city treasurer to the bank, that the bank
may profit out of it, as a return for the
safe keeping thereof for the treasurer. It
is one of the legitimate branches of bank
ing business. V 777
A bank prepares itself for the business
of taking care of other people's money,
provides vaults for its safe keeping and
employes for the transaction of its busi
ness, in order that they may make profit
in the handling and investment of such
idle money as may be intrusted to their
care. * * *
The â¢ constitution prohibits the making
of : profit out of city money, or the use of
the same for any purpose not authorized
by law. Certainly the deposit of the city
funds in a bank permits the bank to make
a profit out of it, and it is equally certain
that such was not the purpose of raising
money in this city by taxation. It is
raised for paying the expenses of the city,
not to loan to a bank. It would seem to
be equally plain that the â  act complained
of in the complaint was within the pro
hibition of section 424 of the Penal Code
forbidding the unlawful depositing :of
money in any bank and making it a felony.
We have seen that said deposits are for the
purpose of making a profit out of the
money, and are prohibited; hence they
are unlawful.
The Supreme Court, however, in Yarnell
vs. City of Los Angeles, passed upon this
question directly, namely: that the de
positing of money in a bank is making
profit out of it,' under violation of section
7, Article 11, of the constitution, and that
such deposit is prohibited by section 424 of
the Penal Code, 87 California, 608. The
court held that, "It seems clear, there
fore, that a scheme which places public
moneys in the possession and control of a
private corporation is entirely inconsistent
with the provisions of section 424 of the
Code above quoted."
The question as to whether special de
posits of public moneys can be made in
banks is not presented in this case and no
opinion is expressed thereon.
CYCLERS SCORE A POINT.
Judge Logan's Decision Pleases the Santa
Cruz Wheelmen.
SANTA '. CRUZ, Cal., Feb. Bicycle
riders were pleased to-day over a decision
of Judge Logan that they cannot be pun
isbed by both fine and imprisonment for
riding on the "sidewalks. But the decision
does not hold': that they may freely ride
on the sidewalks without let or hindrance.
It merely that the ordinance is . not
valid because it provides a penalty of both
fine and imprisonment, being in excess of
the power granted by the charter.
7 The ' decision 'was ; delivered in habeas
corpus proceedings taken to the Superior
Court from Justice Craghill's action in im
posing a fine of $5 and thirty minutes in
the City Prison. ; The sentence was made
by request <of the ' defendant, Ben R. Mar
tin, Deputy County Clerk, who, through
his attorneys, asked that he might be sen
tenced to thirty minutes' imprisonment in
addition to the fine, for the purpose of
testing the validity of the law. . ; Mr.
Martin's offense was not committed on a
public street, but without the business
center, where the roads were very muddy
and the' sidewalk scarcely traveled by pe
destrians.:
MAY. LOSE AN EYE.
Painful Accident to a San Franciscan at

Works, Beale street. San Francisco, en
gaged here on the courthouse, was injured
to-day by a piece of wet mortar falling from
a brick mason's trowel and striking him
full in the open left eye. Mr. Hogue was

caught the lull force of the mortar,
which added to the pain and injury caused
by the burning of the lime. He is under
the care of Dr. Plant, who said to-night
that the injury is liable to cause the loss of
the eye, though it may possibly be saved.
WITHIN POKTY MILES OF LHASA.
Experiences of English Travelers In the
Unexplored Wilds of Thibet.
St. George Littledale and Mrs. Little
dale have just returned to England after
accomplishing a remarkable and hazard
ous journey across Thibet. They were ac
companied by Mr. Littledale's nephew,
W. A. Fletcher.
The party left England in the autumn of
1894. They entered the north of Thibet
from Kashgar across the Kuen-lun Moun
tains by the Cherchen River, with a great
caravan of horses, mules and donkeys.
The travelers kept well to the west of the
route followed by Prince Henry of Orleans
and M. Bonvalot. ' For two months they
were traveling at an altitude of 17,000 feet,
and on their approach to Lhasa had to
cross a difficult pass, rising to a height of
about 20,000 feet.
The hardships, that were endured were
most trying to all^nd Mrs. Littledale suf
fered seriously. Of about a hundred ani
mals only a score or so succeeded in reach
ing the neighborhood of Lhasa. The re
sult was that Mr. .Littlefield bad to aban
don most of his collections, including
many natural history specimens. Still, he
has succeeded in. bringing home a fair col
lection of birds. ;. .
By the pass referred to above the party
succeeded in reaching within forty miles
of Lhasa, nearer than any European has
got since the days of Abbe Hue. This suc
cess was not attained without risk. Leav
ing the pass was a troop of 250 men armed
with matchlocks, who threatened to fire
if the party dared to pass. No one was
more determined to go on than Mrs. Little
dale, although there were only three armed
Sepoys with the party. As a matter of
fact, the travelers did pass through the
gantlet of matchlock men, not one of whom
fired a shot. ,
Mr. and Mrs. Littledale had quite made
up their minds to enter Lhasa. They
would have done so, but when they
camped, aftei crossing the pass, the don
keys, on which were all their baggage,
provisions, etc., had not turned up, and,
indeed, they did not do so till after the
lapse of some time. Partly on this ac
count and partly on account of Mrs.
Littledale's health, Mr. Littledale deter
mined not to force the position, but to
turn westward toward Ladak. The Thibet
ans insisted on the party returning as they
came, across the terrible pass, but this
they absolutely refused to do, and, as
usual, on the display of firmness, the
Thibetans yielded and allowed the
travelers to go their own way. Mr. Little
dale would have liked much to go south
into Sikkim, but under the circumstances
this was impossible. He therefore pro
ceeded northwest by Tengri-Nor and the
group of Jakes which lie between that and
Dadak. The party arrived at Srinagar a
few weeks ago.
Although Mr. Littlefield did not succeed
in actually entering Lhasa, lie has accom
plished far more than any one expected he
would do, considering the conditions un
der which he traveled. He has traversed
a very great extent of unexplored country,,
both in approaching Lhasa and in leaving
it. His map is an admirable piece of work
in view of the circumstances under which
it must have been executed. There are
about thirty., sheets, each about eighteen
inches square, on which are platted;, with
wonderful minuteness, the features of the
country through which the party passed.
The scale of the map is â¢ five miles to the
inch* It forms a substantial addition to
the least known part of Central Asia. Al
together the expedition promises to take a
high rank in the history of geographical
exploration.â London Times.

An Historic Barber-Shop.
Glamorgan's barber-shop in St. Louis,
which is soon to be dismantled; has long
been famous in the West, its original pro
prietors, who were octoroons, established
it in 1852, and' fitted it up luxuriously with
mahogany chairs, marble tubs, imported
from Italy, and the finest of Â» tonsorial
paraphernalia. Dickens was shaved there,
and Grant, General Pope, Benton, Douglas
and other celebrities of the day patronized
it. Grant, indeed, is said to have had his
hair cut there oftener than any other cus
tomer. Perhaps = its crowning glory was
the patronage of the Prince of Wales, who,
finding the Planters' House tubs primeval,
came to lave in Glamorgan's Italian mar
ble. Etiquette forbade him, r however, to
occupy one of the barber's chairs.
By chance it has been discovered that
even the most delicate tracery of the petals
of flowers can be reproduced in metal.
During the trial of a new fuse the other
day a small leaf fell between a dynamite
cartridge and an iron block on which the
cartridge was fired. As a result a perfect
imprint of the leaf was left on the iron.
RAINEY OWNS THE
FIRE DEPARTMENT.
Chief Sullivan Says Sam
Can Pull Him Into
Politics.
HE TOLD MAX POPPER SO.
The Junta Hereby Gives Notice
to a Budget of Strong
Rameyites.
MUST KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF.
From the Appearance of Things at
Present the Boss Is Likely to
Use His Friend.
Gavin McNab's epigrammatical treat
ment of the condition of the local Democ
racy in the Call of yesterday was read by
the faithful of the Junta and pronounced
the correct thing and "a timely stab at
Rainey and Buckley from Gavin."
It also had the effect of stirring up some
of the other war horses, who have been
slumbering with one eye open, waiting for
some one to jab them and open - the other.
Mr. Max Popper, at the club rooms of
the Junta in the Flood building," last night
worked up a few ideas, which he developed
early in the evening and gave forth:
"We want it distinctly understood."
said he, "that neither Rainey nor Buckley
can handle this organization. I refer prin
cipally to Rainey. Ido not consider that
Buckley is very much in it here, anyhow,
although 'it is said by a good many that
Rainey and Buckley are in together, not
withstanding the fact that Sam Rainey
denies it.
; "We simply want to keen Raineyism
minimized so that it cannot get control,
and if it ever should get beyond our power
to quash it I will personally go before the
State Central Committee and oppose
Rainey as vigorously as I know bow. You
cannot put that particular statement too
bard. I mean just what I say, and if the
worst comes to the worst we will smash
rather than have the Rainey influence
dominate in this organization. .
"We are watching every movement that
is made here, and we want to give notice
right now that certain Raineyites must not
attempt to exercise any power here for the
benefit of that particular boss.
"I will even go further than others and
name the men:
"Not Selig of the Twenty-ninth.
"Assistant Chief Engineer Dougherty of
the Thirtieth.
"Senator Armes of the Thirty-first.
"Mr. Gagusof the Tnirty-sixth.
"Ex-Assemblymen Burke and Williams
of the Thirty-seventh.
; "Fire Commissioner Mac Donald of the
Thirty-eighth. - t ; : â¢ ,-'.:_- ' -,' â¢ '
"G. A. Fenton of the Thirty-ninth.
"Eddie Greany of the Forty-second. >. .:
"Secretary Maxwell of the- Fire Depart
ment of the Forty-fourth.
"Those men must be careful to observe
the motive of this organization* must
not in any way attempt to inflict Rainey
upon us. We will not tolerate it in any
way, shape or manner, and clean politics
must prevail from now on. McNab has
handled the case fully enough to.be un
derstood, and we mean just exactly what
we say." . , \
"Recognizing the fact that Chief Sulli
van of the Fire Department and Sam
Rainey are intimate friends would it not
be possible for Rainey to control the Fire
Department?" was asked. -
"Perhaps," replied Mr. Popper, signifi
cantly. "Sullivan told me not so . very
long ago that he had said to Rainey, 'Sam,
you are the only, man who can drag the
Fire Department Into politics.' He told
me further that he believed Rainey bad the
political power to make or break him, and
that he was a Rainey man and Rainey's
friend." :' ... -~'V,m "' 7.'-
"Would not Rainey then take advantage
of Chief Sullivan's faith in him if it came
to an issue and the Fire Department was
required in politics?"
Mr. Popper drew two fingers down the
sides of his nose and looked across the
room a few seconds before he answered
"Perhaps." ,7 '-.-.'â '
"What would be the result?" 7 '.
"It would kill Chief Sullivan, politically,
in San Francisco."
"Is such a thing likely to occur?"
This time Mr. Popper passed his fingers
down his nose several times and took a
good long thought over the matter. Pres
ently he said: "Well, you are at liberty to
draw your own conclusions on that point.
It's bard to tell."'
; The question now arises:. Should Rainey
go to Chief Sullivan and in the majesty of
his might say, "Chief, i need you and the
Fire Department to win out," would Sulli
van stand by his statement to Mr. Popper,
and show that he " believed in Rainey, by
capitulating, or would he refuse and stand
aloof from politics as Mr.'McNab says he
desires to?
The question was asked of several men
who have political noses and who use
them. They didn't like to express an off
hand opinion on the first point, but when
it was put direct in the form of "Will
Rainey use the Fire Department?" some
body answered:
" "Will a duck swim?"
PIETRO GORI'S VIEWS
An Italian Anarchist Who Has
Given Up All for His
Belief.
Automatic Machinery Will Bring the
Dawn of the Era Gori
Hopes For. â 
Pietro Gori is an anarchist and glories in
it. If any one sought to mince matters;
and called him a socialist Signor Gori
would deny the soft impeachment and call
himself an anarchist out and out. "An
archism," be said: yesterday," "is liberty of
liberty. It is the highest school of social-
Ism, the f criticism of capital and the eco
nomic base of future society." ""\ 7
7 This talented ; young "â¢â ltalian,., who has
just arrived in this City from Denver, has
given up a brilliant career at the Milanese
bar. and has ccme - into exile, all for the
sake of his principles!
"The passion for propaganda is stronger
than I,'.' he said yesterday. "I believe in
anarchy, feel it in my heart and' have to
spread it, just as a musician is compelled
by some inward passion to make music,
or an artist to paint pictures. Anarchy is
my life." > .
"No, no," he continued, laughing, in re
ply to a question. "I have no bombshells
in my pockets ; nothing but a torrent of
words," and he drew out a capacious ar
ray of papers and manuscripts, for Pietro
Gori is a great reader and student,. and in
the few, leisure moments he has allowed
himself during the last few years he has
showed his ability as a playwright.
7 Gori was born in Messina twenty-six
years ago, and has all the eloquence and
spontaneous expression of the true meri
dional. , He ': made a brilliant university
career and settled 'down as a lawyer in
Milan, where he speedily made a name for
his eloquence. -
The poverty he saw around him among
the working people distracted Gori from
bis legal work. He became a socialist,
then an anarchist, with a large following
among the students of the city. His
propaganda was soon stopped, however,
and- in order to avoid imprisonment
Gori went into exile and is now traveling
in the United States, leaving a streak of
anarchy wherever he goes.

When asked to define his idea of anarch
ism Pietro Gori said : "It is almost impos
sible in a few words, but I may say that
the anarchistic socialists, like all the other
socialists, desire the abolition of individual
property, because it is natural . that when
some possess too much there would be
others who possess too little. Anarchism
is the ideal of eouality joined to perfect
liberty."
. Signor ridicules the idea of perfect
Ehysical or intellectual equality, but he
elieves that every .man and woman
should stand equal in the race of life. He
says that Herbert Spencer, Jean Jacques
Rousseau and a host of other famous
writers have been anarchists at heart.
. Speaking of labor and. capital, he said:
"I hold that the laborer is the true pro
ducer and that the capitalist plays but a
poor part. Take a thousand dollars and
shut it up in a box for a year. What has it
produced at the end of that time? Noth
ing, of course, and that nothing shows
what capital would always be without
labor. Machines have not yet become
quite automatic, the capitalist still has to
depend on the laborers for production, and
tbe laborers who make the machines and
work them are not getting their share of
the production.
â¢'When machines become automatic, and
they will be brought to that perfection in
time, then the reign of anarchy will begin,"
said Gori with a somber enthusiasm. "The

AN ANTAfiCTIC CONTINENT.
Deductions From Reports of Mar
iners.
The Hydrograpbic Office at Washington
has received corroborative reports from
mariners which go far to demonstrate the
existence of an Antarctic continent of con
siderable extent and elevation. The naval
hydrographer, in connection with a limit
chart issued to-day, gives a few of the
most important reports from a navigator's
point of view, and says: # 7
"On no other frequented trade route are
vessels so liable to be obstructed by drift
ice as in that portion of the South Atlantic
lying to the east of Cape Horn and the
Falkland Islands. As given by the most
reliable authorities, the mean ice limit for
this region runs northeastward from Cape
Horn through latitude 50 degrees south,
longitude 52 degrees west, as far as latitude
42 degrees south, longitude 35 degrees
west, the occurrence of ice north or the
fortieth parallel being rare.
"The accompanying chart shows the
limits, according to the numerous reports
received by the United States Hydro
graphic Office, of the enormous ice-fields
encountered by mariners in those waters
during the exceptionally severe years of
iaarases?.- iii.ir ria mini iâ â  n Â»i J â iM'uraw
1892 and 1893. All of these : reports agree
in describing the icebergs seen during these
years as colossal in height and extent, and
herded so closely together that any attempt
to force a passage through the main body
of the drift was attended by grave danger,
many vessels being more or less damaged
by collision and two lost.
"A remarkable . feature â of the ice teen
during these years was the different act* of
neighboring bergs, many of them preseÂ»nt
ine the sharp outline, jagged edge and
perpendicular face of recently detached
ice, while others showed evidence of hav
ing been long afloat. Earth stains and
discoloration s upon several showed that at
some period they had been in contact with
the land." JggSggj pHgBFApSt â¢
The last statement, which 'the hydro
grapher claims full justification in mak
ing from the report he has on the subject,
is also verified by the fact, well known to
scientific men, that icebergs of such size
as reported above could not bate been
formed on on small, low-lying Islands, but
from a large continent of such height that
enormous glaciers could be formed and
progress toward the ocean.

Mrs. Booth Addresses a Pa
thetic Appeal to Cali
fornians.
GOVERNOR BUDD'S GIFT.
The Executive Makes a Per
sonal Donation for the
Cause.
SEVENTY AGENCIES STARTED.
A Well-Formed Plan for Finding Em
. ployment for Convicts Who
Really Want Work.
When Mrs. Ballington Booth, the Salva
tionist, was on this coast some months
ago, the lady gave the State prisons a
great deal of attention with the view to ar
ranging for employment for discharged
convicts who were anxious and ready to
retrieve their names and become desirable
and respected citizens of the community.
Mrs. Booth visited Governor Budd, and
had a long conference with him bearing
on the proposed work, with the result that
the Governor became quite interested in
the proposition, and offered to give the
Army all the support and assistance in
his power so that something could be ac
complished on the lines laid down by her. ;
Since Mrs. Booth's departure from San I
Francisco she has been in constant com- |
munication with the Governor and' repre- j
sentatives of the Army here, and issues i
over her signature the following righteous
and sincere appeal to the people of this
State:
To the People of California:. During my late
trip to Caiiiornia .no meeting so thoroughly
stirred my heart as that which took place in
the San Quentin penitentiary. I have always
felt a special interest in those whose lives
have come under the keenest degradation of
sin and who have been planed away from their
fellow-men within the confines of the stone
walls of a prison. I think, however, that in
rest has been more fixed and brought home
to my own heart, and 1 have more longed to
put it into practical form in the helping of
prisoners, through my visiting San Quentin.
than by any other experience I have so fur had
in my public life for bod. .
I only wish I could burn in upon the hearts
of the fortunate the terrible need and sorrow
and cry for help that reaches my heart from
the imprisoned ones all over this our country.
It seems to me that the general public, com- |
posed of fortunate ones upon whose life the I
blight of shame and imprisonment has never
fallen, cannot avoid facing the facts and ac
knowledging that a great responsibility lies
somewhere for the dealing with and effectually ]
helping of this class. We cannot take great ;
herds of our fellow-men, however far they may j
have gone in wrongdoing and lawlessness, i
brand them as malefactors and then turn from j
them, giving them no way of removing the i
brand from their foreheads and the disgrace j
from their life, without realizing that some- j
where, from some source, human help and j
sympathy must be given them or else they la-
DOT under a cruel wrong and a bitter injustice |
that will find its way back like a boomerang of j
misfortune upon society at large.
' Jn- trying to bring this . matter before your |
tt'arts, there are one or two things to which I
wish to call your attention. Firstâ lt must be
remembered that many of the men who are to
day serving terms in the penitentiaries have
never had a chance in life; that under the
same circumstances those who, from their
honest and upright position to-day, are con
demning them might themselves have fallen.
If you were to-day to talk to the criminals who
are suffering the just punishment of heinous
crimes you would find that many of them have
had the world against them since the day they
started In it. No home influences to help
them, no Christian hand to point them to
Christ, no honest, upright friend to stir their
dormant consciences, but hands on every side
to drag them down, to teach them crime and
to make them what they have become to-day.
The words of a murderer hanged in San Quentin
whilst I was on the coast still linger in my
mind, "I never had a home," and so do the
words of a poor thief whom we reached by our
slum work in New York, who told us that the
nearest approach to a home he had ever known
was the warmth and comfort of a jail kitchen.
, Should this not arouse our pity for the pris
oner instead of making us look upon him as
me wild outlaw, who has willingly turned
his back upon goodness and righteousness and
chosen the paths of wrong doing?
Then it should be remembered that many, :
many, during their term in jail or penitentiary
resolve to do better. They have time to think.
They are separated from the temptations which
have surrounded them to a certain extent and
they are feeling the consequence of crime.
When the iron doors|swing open and they pass
out into free air, bearing their own name once
more instead of being known only as a num
ber, what faces them? Why the cruel fact that
they are marked men, surrounded by tempta
tions and with the world against them.
The criminal records of this country, or any
other for the matter of that, will show the
great number who, having once become crimi
nals continue in crime, being arrested again
and again. Some would have you believe that
this is because they are criminals born and
their natures turn always to the perpetration
of such acts. In some few cases that may seem
to be, but it should never be taken as an existing
fact in any criminal's life till he has had every :
chance to reform. In most cases, it is not from
the criminals' volition, but from the stress of
over-mastering circumstances. Why do they
steal, lie, deceive, scheme, plot and murder?
Because they enjoy it? No! Because they
must live, and because in many instances they
have no alternative. Because the bitterness
of their cruel lot and the hardness of the
world's heart toward them has entered into
their very soul with a poison that makes them
feel they are veritable Cains, with every man's
hand against them. Hence, they declare in
response: "And our hands shall be against |
every man."
Prison life reforms very few. There the
young offender, the old hardened, vicious na
ture and the sensitive, educated and refined
natures are, by force of circumstances, brought '
together in the one awful leveling influence of j
disgrace. I believe there are many noble j
hearts and beautiful natures- within the con
lines of the prison, as truly as I know there are
scoundrels outside, who, through ' money, or
name, or influence, have been more fortunate
and have kept their freedom. Think of the
terrible mortification. Think of the awful
heart-burning. Think of .' the . terrible bitter
ness that must be borne home upon them,
when their efforts of honesty and their deter
minations to do better are thwarted by the
suspicions and coldness with which they are
met on the new and difficult path on which
they hope to push their way to the point of
once more becoming honest and useful citi
zens. ' iiii'ivii'TTHiT^"Tgy^wifliV^ m^'iiiirri' nT
These men should be redeemed. For (and I
tell you as one who knows them) within their
poor crushed and wounded hearts/there are
bright possibilities and noble traits of I charac
ter, which, if helped to develop and brought
forward by the touch of tender love and divine
pity, shall yet triumph ever all the tendencies
that have dragged them downward. .
It should again be remembered that in many
cases drink was the curse that brought the
criminal to where he Is to-day. There are
those outside the prison walls who are slaves
to drink, and only by good fortune ; have re
tained their place in the world; who are just
as much in danger at any moment, while un
der this . terrible sense-robbing, conscience
drowning power, to commit similar offenses.
Both the drink-slave outside the jail and the
one within it need our help and call forth our
pity. But I cannot see why one class should
be born with, and given chances, and looked
â  upon as not yet beyond hope, while the other
is forever stigmatized ". because punishment
and the shame of imprisonment have overtaken
him.
It seems to me in all conscience that Impris
onment, with -all it means, is- punishment
enough, and that when the law and State say
to a man, "Your term is up; justice is satis
fied; your punishment is over," society should
echo earnestly and practically the words ; once
spoken to a disgraced outcast by the pure > lips
of the loving Savior, "Go and sin no more."
As it is, the sentiment of the world' generally
shouts after him, "There he goes! Watch him 1
He is a daneerous man. He is sure to be up to
his old tricks again."
Is there anything more calculated to force a
man to crime than the feeling that everybody
expects him |to commit j it? â¢ Why, in human
nature, from ' the cradle to the grave, you can
see the terribly depressing results of such an
influence. Let parents tell a child that they
are sure it is going to be naughty, that they
know it is going to do certain things, and let
them watch it with suspicion. That child
almost, without volition, finds - Itself com
pelled, by the very perverseness of human na
ture, to perpetrate the naughtiness they ex
pect; and to every mind such unwise parents
are themselves morally responsible for â  the
deed.
There are remedies I am convinced to meet
the terrible need that faces us, and I think as I
put myself into the criminal's place and try
and look at the subject from his standpoint,
that I can speak with some insight on the sub
ject. You know that I represent "the church
of the black sheep"; hence 1 speak feelingly,
and this is not with me a mere consideration
of existing evils. It is something that is
born into mv very heart, and has aroused the
most intense feelings of my nature. .
I believe the first remedy is good, pure, help
ful influence, with hopeful love and faith,
brought to bear Don the hearts and lives of
criminals while they are in the penitentiary.
There you have the black sheep coralled.
When they are at large you have to wait for
them to come to you, and other influences are
drawing them from you. When they are there
you have got them, and can bring right in
fluence to bear upon them. Why let so mag
nificent an opportunity for helping them for
good and bringing purity, love and sympathy
to bear upon them be so cruelly wasted? It
is not religious discourses or the reading of
prayers that they need. It is the real personal
influence of goodness and purity that must be
brought to bear upon them. Then again, while
in prison, their hands must be filled with help
ful work, wnich will not only, keep them occu
pied and hence out of the mlschiet that natur
ally would breed in their minds, and hearts
were they idle, but they must be so equipped
witn a knowledge of useful employment, and
such employment as is adapted to their special
qualifications, bent or genious, that they may
have something worth looking forward to in
their future lives, some possibility of making
their way in the hard difficulties which face
every man in the world who has, by the sweat
of his brow, to keep soul and body together.
Secondly, I believe he must have a chance on
leaving the penitentiary. Helping hands must
welcome him. Employers of labor must give
him a chance, and public sentiment must be
made to see that it is an inhuman injustice to
brand a humau being and send him forth for
life as a scapegoat. He must not be condemned
as unworthy of trust until he has given proof
of such unworthiness.- Oh, if this principle
could only be grasped, accepted, and put into
practice what a day-dawn of hope would burst
upon the criminals of our land.
The Salvation Armyâ the "church of the
black sheep"â alive to this great need. We
firmly believe In the reformation, the salva
tion of criminals. We have seen wonders
worked in the lives of thousands whom others
would have called hopeless. We engage, so far
as it is within our power, to stand with loving
hopefulness at the prisoner's side and say to
him, "While you have the desire to better,
while you prove that desire by your lifeâ
past record shall be forgotten." We say more
than that to him, "Though your own poor
efforts may be feeble, though your circum
stances, your temptations and your difficulties
may seem overwhelming, we can tell you of a
power that can enter your life and transform
it, making of you ! a new man, so that old
things may pass away and all things may be
come new."
If we can get the necessary help and sym
pathy from the public to enlarge- our work in
this direction we will gladly undertake work
within the prison walls, and also to take the
prisoners under our wing as they emerge once
more into the glare of daylight that is be
wildering to their poor shame-clouded eyes
and to a freedom to which their monotonous
prison step has not yet become accustomed.
Our people understand this class; they can
bring a loving influence to bear upon the
heart of the convict. The convict knows them
and believes in their sincerity. He feels that
: they come to him as comrades and brothers,
not to pity and patronize, not to preach at or
condemn him, but. to bid him look upward
and hope, and to give him that which so many
' poor starved hearts have longed for in vainâ
the touch of love and the word of true sym
pathy. It has been an encouragement to me
to receive the following kind expressions from
Governor James Budd :
"Your labor here for unfortunates is bearing
fruit, and your interest, in prison reformation
has resulted in substantial efforts toward pro
curing positions for prisoners who, after ser
vice, desire to labor. The question of reforma
tion of criminals is one of the most important
we have to consider. * * * Knowing that
no agency can reach this class of unfortunates
so successfully as can your organization, I am
willing to subscribe $100 toward a fund to be
expended by you in aiding discharged prison
ers to procure labor in this State."
Mrs. Ballington Booth, .
On behalf of the prisoners of California. .
"What we propose to do to accomplish
the results so â  ably set forth by Mrs.
Booth," said Brigadier J. J. Kappel of the
Pacific Coast division, yesterday, "is to
get thoroughly acquainted with the pris
oners in our weekly visits to the peniten
tiary and the prisons of the Stale, and in
order to bring â  this about we have ap
pointed two sergeants in ] each town of im
â  portance to give the jails and prisons the
! closest attention. There will be a man
| and a woman in each town to represent
! the Army, and it will be their duty, to get
: as closely as possible to the hearts of the
unfortunate men who need spiritual and
j material assistance that they may reform
| and become respected men.
"We will establish employment offices
in every town of importance, and as soon
I as a prisoner is discharged the Army will
prepare to take immediate charge of him
and find him employment before he can
get back to his old haunts and old associ
ates. ;We will be in constant touch with
the farms, mines, fruit-picking institutions
and all channels where men who desire it
can get something to do, and just as soon
as a man gets his freedom we will see that
he has some legitimate employment to oc
cupy bis mind and make him feel that he
is not an outcast and a knave in the sight
of men. 3SBOKBI
"Altogether there are seventy agencies
of that kind in the State, and that we will
accomplish much good there is no. possi
ble doubt. The matter deserves attention,
and we are in the work heart and soul."
THE MASTEB PAINTERS.
They Have Not Received Any Com
plaint from the Journeymen.
The Master Painters of the Pacific Coast
held their regular meeting last evening in
the Builders' Exchange. The attention of
the members was called to an open letter
published in The Call of January 28, that
was issued by the members of the Journey
men Painters' and. Decorators' Union. In
the open letter the journeymen stated that
they had often attempted to confer with
the master painters with the view of im
proving their condition. They also de
manded better wages and -hours of work.
The secretary stated that he had not re
ceived any communication from the Paint
ers' Union and that the records of the as
sociation do not show that any complaints
or communications had been received from
the complainants. 71 Under these condi
tions the master painters decided ; that
there was nothing in the premises for
them to act upon.
The annual election was held and the
following officers were selected for the en

by a neck in one '/ of the most exciting fin
ishes of : the meeting.'. The latter : young
ster was warmly applauded for his fine
ride, and were ,he a Doggett or a ; Taral ;it
would be track talk for many moons.
P Tne fine weather and a good : , card drew
out lovers of the sport in liberal numbers.
Of the 'I six , favorites, three headed their
fields to the wire. : 7 '
. The Richmond stake, a handicap over a
mile, saw eight . -racy-looking thorough
breds face the starter to do battle for the
$1800 prize, of which slsoo was the winner's
apportionment. .In at top weight, : 118
pounds; imp. Star Ruby commanded first
call in the betting, with. Ferrier and In
stallator the next best fancied. Thornhill
and Bellicoso were by no means friendless
at more lengthy prices. â ;- ';.',;â¢ ;.-;
The start was far from being one of
Ferguson's best efforts, the field being well
strung out. Bellicoso, Rosebud and Char
treuse headed the van when the flag fell.
Bellicoso : made all ; the running, showing
in the lead until the stretch was reached,
where Star Ruby had a slight advantage.
The latter horse was away from the post
poorly, and the effort, to make up lost
ground ' proved too , much for him, and it
was soon made evident that his chance of
winning was slieht, ; â  â¢â¢ v
As the wire was neared Rosebud looked
a likely winner, until Bergen brought In
stallator up, and in one of his famed ; fin
ishes -beat the Burns j & Waterhouse
entry out two lengths, in the fast time,
considering the track, which was slow, of
1:41%. â¢ Bellicoso was third, v
Barney Schreiber's Pearson opened favor
ite for the opening six-furlong dash, but
gave wav to Joe : Terry,' who ', was ' backed
down from 214 -to1:to Bto 5. The \ well
bred maiden took the lead after a quarter
had been traveled; and t won by a length
with Pearson in the place. ; r. :
The second event, at seven furlongs over
the 1 inside course, - went jto the > second
choice, Eckert, who'; beat 'Modesto a neck
in *ai hard r drive. The favorite, Monitor,
made the running for the; greater part of
the J distance, t when .he grew weary and
finished unplaced/ 1, .7 ". ' .r :
r ,The steeplechase was a fine betting
affair. '; The first ; plunge ; was made 'â ; on
Montalvo,' whose odds were cut from fours
to 7 to 5.> Colonel Weightman was backed
down several points, and â¢ at 1 the | last mo
ment a strong play caused; the bookies to
rub the price against Gold Dust v from. 12
down to 5. > Cairns on .the latter horse
took ; his â  mount out in ; front when the
field was dispatched, was always in the
lead and won â¢in a drive by two lengths
from Montalvo.
A cheap lot of "dogs" started in the
fifth race, a five and ; a - half ; furlong run.
Clara Wilson was* a 3to 5 favorite and won
cleverly, with the 15 to 1 shot Myrtle H in
the place; Â« ; * 7 " ' V
AH of the other events on the pro
gramme were overshadowed by the last
race of the day, a mile selling dash with
five starters. ; Wheel -of ; Fortune was an
even-money favorite, with , Hidago a de
cidedly well played 3;to 2 second choice.
Dungarven was well supported for the
place, with some straggling coin finding
its way in on Little Cripple and Polaski.
The start was only a fair ; one, the favor
ite being away last. Dungarven, followed
by Polaski, showed the way for half the
distance. At this stage, Chorn,' on Hidago,
cut loose, and, rounding his field, was but
a head back of Dungarven as the bend for
the wire was reached, with Little Cripple
a close third. Driving furiously Dungar
ven and Hidago : were joined less than a
furlong from home .by the "Wheel," who
by many had been considered hopelessly
out of the race. In a great finish Coady
got Wheel of Fortune past the wire a neck
in advance of : Hidago, with Little Cripple
and Dungarven lapped on the black horse,
fighting for third place, which was given
to Little Cripple. â¢>
Track and Paddock Items.
This is opening day at Ingleside. The
programme is one of rare excellence. It
is "Ladies' Day," and a big crowd is sure
to be in attendance. - .7 v :
The stewards thought that Dungarven's
showing was -such an improvement over
his previous > runs â¢ that an investigation
was in order. â¢ Louis Ezcll, owner of the
horse, proved to their entire satisfaction
that he had backed the black horse in
former runs, and was completely ex
onerated from any attempt at fraud. In
the future the board of stewards will take
steps to prevent owners from. starting
horses on tracks that "it is a notorious fact
are not to their liking. The public will
thus be protected ' to an ' extent from
squandering their dollars. â¢
ONE ARMORY FOR ALL
The First Infantry, N. G. C, to
Be Concentrated on Page
. Street. .
Armory Extension Proposed to Make
' Room for the Na
tionals.
Captain Hanks, commanding the Second
Brigade Signal Corps, has received a hint
from General Warfield that. the quarters
occupied by the signal men in the Page
street armory may be needed for infantry
companies of tbe First Regiment.
Referring to : this subject, General War
field last evening remarked: "The Signal
Corps is attached to the Second Brigade
and â¢ reports to -these headquarters. Tne
captain has been advised to look for quar
ters elsewhere. T. have, not ordered the
corps away from Page street, and no orders
will be given until proper quarters are
found elsewhere. Of course, lam not go
ing to send the Signal Corps out on the
streets.
â¢ "I understand," continued General War
field, "that Colonel Macdonald can accom
modate ten of the companies of his regi
ment on Page street if the quarters now
used by the Signal Corps can be utilized."
General Warfield, turning to Major
Dorn, judge-advocate, Second Brigade,
asked for the exact reading of the regula
tions relating to regimental concentra
tion. The judge-advocate produced Sec
tion 267 of the regulations, which reads as
fallows: . â¢ -. : -
The companies of! each regiment, when sta
tioned in the same city, must be concentrated
in one armory, whenever sufficient accommo
dations can be provided.
' The general invited particular attention
to the mandatory provision of the military
law. '-â â¢ In border to provide the necessary
quarters for twelve companies, Colonel
Macdonald is negotiating with Peter Dean,
the owner of the armory. ; He desired to
know "whether , accommodations can be
provided by an extension of the building.
When this extension is completed, the
two companies on ' Ellis street can be ac
commodated in the regimental armory.
The hint to the Signal Corps puts an
end to the proposed four-company concern
on Ellis street. There is plenty of room
in the Page-street building 7 â¢: for all the
companies but the '-'-Nationals; and it is
generally understood that ' there 1 is no
course open to Colonel Macdonald but to
house , the ten organizations in that
armory. This will be the beginning of
the plan to get all the companies in the
regiment together under one roof, but just
at present it will precipitate a new embar
rassment.- ' : -
: .This is expected to show itself -in Com
panies F and K. There will be wide dis
satisfaction in these organizations on gen
eral principles, and it will . require all of
the colonel's tact to preserve harmony.
Several weeks ago, when V and X received
permission to abide -with*- the Nationals,
they visited' the* Ellis-street armory and
took a look, at the rooms. Captain Cun
ningham of X selected the rooms on the
second floor which extend along the front
of the building. â¢ ;
- He was to be allowed the use of the large
hall on the same floor once a week and the
rent was placed at $55 a month. Company
F agreed to occiipv the rooms on the next
floor, also facing Ellis street. Leases were
drawn up, arrangements of all kinds com
pleted ' and the two companies were to
move in on February 1.

GUILLE MAKES HIS DEBUT.
A Friendly Reception Is Ac
corded the Tenor in " Les
Huguenots."
SOME EFFECTIVE CHORUSES.
Prince Luigi of Savoy and His Aids
de-Camp Witness the Per
formance. 7 .
There was a visible falling off in the at
tendance at the Baldwin Theater last
night. No doubt one reason was that the
opera "Les Huguenots" is not so attrac
tive as the "Aida". or "Carmen." Mey
erbeer's showy, meretricious music does
not wear well. It is a little like a glitter
ing, tinseled robe that is growing thread
bare here and there.
"The Huguenots," however, is ' well
suited to the talent of the Tavary Company.
There is no denying that the work con
tains some magniticentlyeffeetive choruses,
particularly those for male voices; and
these received a satisfactory rendering,
particularly the "Deo lo Vuoie" and the
rataplan chorus. The solo singers also
were, for the most part, well fitted to their
various roles. â¢':-.â 
Guille, who made his debut for this sea
son, was warmly welcomed. Vocally speak
ing, he was an excellent Raul, using his fine
voice artistically and. with considerable
expression. He was particularly ap
plauded for his first aria and for his scena
with the â  Queen. Mme. Tavary was effi
cient as Valentina, her singing was a little
more > strident than in "Aida,". but she
looked and acted her role better than she
did that of the Nubian slave on Monday.
Mile. Anna Lichter, as Marguerite of
Valois, bore off a large share of the honors
of the evening. She sang the florid vocal
embroidery of her role with grace and
fluency. Her voice sounded a trifle un
sympathetic, but it is well placed and well
under control. Mile. : Lichter also looked
very handsome, though her coronet at the
back of her head gave her the appearance
of Lucia, not the lady of the mad scene,
but she of "1 Promessi Sposi" notoriety.
Mme. Belle Tomlins, the contralto of the
company, made her first appearance last
night in the role of Urbano. She was a
disappointment, as her vocal method is
tiicky and she did not show any capacity
for acting. The dashing, mischievous
spirit of the page, who teases the cheva
liers by showing the letter and raising the
hopes of each in turn, was entirely lacking.
Mme. Tomlins sang "Xobil Signor," in
fact, as if it had been a love lament or a
.dirge, : and her ventriloquial chest notes,
which were separated from - her upper
tones by a gasping hiccup, produced an
almost painful impression on her audi
ence.
The basso, Abramoff, again proved him
self to be a fine artist. The part of Marsel,
Raul's aggressive Huguenot servant, is
not a role that generally commands the
sympathy of the audience, but Abramoff 's
intelligent acting, and bis fine singing
made the part one of the most interesting
in the cast. Max Eugene was' a stately
Philip de Severs, and Schuster was at
home as the Count di St. Bris.
Toward the finale of the . second act,
Prince Luigi of Savoy, accompanied by his
two aids-de-camp and several officers of
the Cristoforo Colombo, entered the thea
ter. Tbey wore regulation evening dress,
which, perhaps, accounts for their not be
ing recognized at once. The Prince wan
dered forward looking for his seat and not
finding it, "leaned rather disconsolately
against the wall, near the entrance to one
of the boxes, guarded to right and left by
his two faithful aids._ In that position he
was promptly recognized by people who
remembered his picture, and there was a
mild sensation - in . the theater as the
whisper "Prince Luigi" began to circulate.
At "the end of the act the Italian officers
were taken in tow by an usher and con
ducted to their seats in the dress circle,
where they remained during the rest of
the time they spent in the theater..
Europe's Holdings in Africa.
, Within the scope of a magazine article it
is impossible to describe the steps which
France, Germany and Italy severally took.
A sufficient idea, however, may be gained
by the casual reader of what has been done
when I say that within the last ten years
France has acquired of Equatorial Africa
about 300,000 square miles, in which there
are now 300 Europeans; Germany, 400,000
square miles; Italy, 547,000 square miles;
and Portugal has now a defined territory
extending over 710,000 square miles.
France, moreover, has been active farther
north, in the Sahara and in West Africa,
and claims rights over 1,600,000 square
miles; while Germany, in Southwest
Africa and the Cameroons, asserts her rule
over 540,000 square miles.â Henry M. Stan

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
The emergency is with us and the emer
gency tariff we must have. .
The non-partisan always begins with
fusion and ends with confusion. . .
The St. Paul is free at last, but the ship
of state is still stuck on the Senatorial bar.
Up to date it has not been observed that
Harrison's retirement has caused a deficit
anywhere.

There may be still some money in Cuba
for Spain if she will sell the island before
she ruins it.
Dunraven has consulted the Prince of
Wales, and let us hope the Prince advised
him to imitate the clam.
The fact that the Standard Oil Company
has been robbed is a proof that there isn't
always honor among thieves.
There is a time for everything, and the
Senators should take notice that this par
ticular time is for tariff reform.
The Cuban army is said to be nearly
barefooted, and perhaps that is the reason
the war is so much like a footrace.
If Congress intends to rake over the
muck of the Cleveland bond deal it should
begin now while the weather is cool.
If Democracy expects to find a Moses it
will have to look for him amid the bul
rushes at the head waters of Salt river.
The statesman who demands money
from Turkey by way of indemnity may
get a feather in his cap, but that is all.
The only money # question before this
Congress is that of providing a revenue
large enough to put an end to the deficit.
The House and the Senate work to
gether about as harmoniously as a team
made up of a racehorse and a stalled ox.

One of the curiosities of politics at this
time is the frequency with which the Ohio
folks rise up and swear they are solid for
McKinley. 7i*

The silver bill and the tariff bill are two
distinct things, and if the Senate tries to
confound them it will be the Senate that
is confounded. .
The East has had another earthquake

zard. There is a monotony even in the

Senator Morrill was right in telling the
Senators it is about time to follow the ex
ample of Massachusetts and pray "God
save the commonwealth."
'The movement for the construction of
our new Postofflce building is still under
way, but it is so far under that no one can
see it anywhere on the way. . -y-
It now appears that Huntington has
never paid Kentucky for his license to run
a freight train and has been doing an il
licit business all these years.
From the way his speech has been con
demned Tillman can derive the consoling
knowledge that it has been very widely
read, and that it made an impression.
Because some men are opposed to the
Government ownership of railroads Mr.
Huntington thinks they favor . his refund
ing scheme, but he lies under a mistake.
. Gavin McNab was right in saying "A
boss is the bridge over which the aristo
cratic evil-doer can reach and traffic with

The fact that a man in Tennessee es
caped death by having a folded newspaper
in his pocket has a moral for everybody.
Now is the time to subscribe for The Call.
With the railroad fight, a Senatorial
fight and a general reform movement on
hand' all at once, Kentucky is having a
regular carnival of legislation this â winter.
, .
Every day's record of trade and industry
emphasizes the need of a return to the
protective system, and until that is done
it will remain the greatest issue in our
politics.

Instead of borrowing so much money to
maintain the gold reserve it might have
been cheaper in the end to hire the Wall

It is said as soon as Parliament meets
the Liberals will challenge the foreign
policy of the Salisbury government and
then we shall know whether that policy
has any fight in it. .

If the San Jacinto volcano turns out to
be the real thing we will have one more

ton and see the lava flow.
' Colonel Morrison of Illinois is admitted
by his Democratic admirers to lack the
magnetism that rouses' men to fight for
victory, but they say he is sufficiently sage
to take defeat philosophically.
Gavin McNab's paradox of getting the
Fire Department to participate in politics
in order to keep out of politics is not easy
of solution, but all the same any^ set of
men that take part with Democracy' this
year will certainly be out of politics before
the year closes. liaSSSSnSÃÃfiHfllj
MISREPRESENTED CITIZENS.
. If any proof .were. needed of the wisdom
of the opponents of the refunding scheme
in keeping that contest separate and dis
tinct from. agitation for Government
ownership of railroads, that, ; proof can be
found in the eagerness .with which Mr.
Huntington and his supporters are trying
to confound them together. This eager
ness manifests itself in many ways, and is
seen with particular clearness in the effort
made by the railroad : organs to represent
every citizen who is not iin favor of gov
ernmental railroads as an advocate of the
refunding scheme.
Many of those citizens whose names
have been used by the railroad organs as
representatives of a California sentiment
in favor of refunding have publicly pro
tested against the wrong done them.
Others who have not protested have proba
bly thought it unnecessary to do so, as
the very words attributed to them by the
railroad publications show that they ex
pressed objections to Government owner
ship and not an approval of any refunding
scheme. Some of the best and most pub
lic spirited men in the City and the State
have been thus misrepresented; and, -as a
consequence, have had the mortification
of seeing themselves advertised as sup
porters of the monopoly against the pub
lic welfare when they have been as true to
the public weal as any of their neighbors.
Cunning as has been this trick of the
railroad to spread confusion in Congress,
and if possible to produce dissensions and
divisions in California, the scheme will
fail. The people have been sufficiently
educated on all phases of the great contest
..to understand that opposition to Govern
ment ownership does not mean a subservi
ence to Mr. Huntington. It means that
many men. who doubt the wisdom or the
constitutionality of the operation of rail
roads by the National Government are still
in favor of enforcing the law honestly and
impartially against a great corporation ex
actly as it would be enforced against an
individual of less wealth, power and skill
in evading law. 7*77
The publication of these misleading and
often directly false reports of the senti
ments of prominent men in San Fran
cisco, whether dispatched from here or in
vented in Washington, have done great in
justice to those who have been misrepre
sented. It is only another evidence of the
unscrupulous tactics which the managers
of the monopoly 'permit their agents to
pursue. The effect in this City, will not be
great, for our people have learned by long
experience to distrust everything that a
railroad organ says. The danger point is
in Washington. To that city our watch
fulness must be' directed and every Con
gressman must be made to understand
clearly that 'what California asks at this
time is not the Government ownership and
operation of the railroad, but simply the
enforcement of the law and a refusal on
the part of Congress to condone frauds.
NON-PARTISANS AGAIN.
The announced intention of some of the
leaders of the old Non-Partisan party to
reorganize for the approaching municipal
election incapable of analysis. F.J.Sul
livan justifies the movement with this
statement:
"Some may think that this being a
Presidential year we should not put a non
partisan ticket in the field. But with
those I disagree. There is a necessity for
such a party. Just look at the eight
Supervisors who now govern the City. See
the enormous taxation that the people are
saddled with. There is no reduction in
the water rates, but rather an : increase,
when the number of hydrants that have
been put down during the year is consid
ered. * * * â¢We think that we will be
able to elect a Board of Supervisors that
will look after the interests of the people
instead of after the interests of the cor
porations." Mr. Sullivan declares that a
firm stand must be made for good govern
ment and that we must elect men "who
are not owned by corrupt bosses and
grinding corporations." 7>
Apart from the fact, sometimes well
found and sometimes not, that "non
partisan" parties commonly are sprung
by leaders having political axes to grind
which regular political organizations are
unwilling to sharpen, is the fact that it is
manifestly unfair to assume that the regu
lar parties, are unwilling or incapable of
providing a good government and unwise
to deprive them of . the virtuous influences
which non-partisans profess to exercise.
It is far better to crush corrupt bosses by
concentrating" the decent elements in es
tablished, parties than to perpetuate the
existence of such bosses by abandoning
the parties to their power.
It is also manifestly unfair to propose an
independent organization without having
first submitted the names of desirable can
didates to the old parties and receiving ex
plicit statements as to whether these can
didates would be acceptable to them.
More than that, it is difficult to imagine
any citizen loyal to the principles of one
of the old parties who is willing to aban
don it in the hour of its need and deliber
ately turn it over to rogues.- '
It is a fact familiar to all who under
stand the political situation at present , in
San Francisco that while some of the offi
cers elected by the Republican party have
disgraced the City the boss power, which
thrust them into office has been practically
destroyed, and that this is now the time of
all others for the' decent elements of the
City to support that party in its determina
tion to purify its organization and elect
honest and competent officers. The Demo
cratic party is at present sadly divided, its
better element making a hard struggle to
keep Buckley from dominating it.
A familiar ruse of corrupt bosses who see
that their power is threatened by the con
centration of decency in one party is to in
stigate an independent movement for the
purpose of dividing the best people and
perpetuating the corrupt regime. r , It is not
meant to say that this is the case with the
present proposed movement, but it is easy
to understand that corrupt, politics would
be vastly strengthened by such a splitting
up, and that the bosses must feel happy
over the proposed non-partisan reorgan
ization. jABBÂ§HBfIfeÂ£BRSHKRSKfi
SILVER AND THE TARIFF.
The refusal of the leading silver Repub
licans in the Senate to support the Demo
crats and Populists in an effort to substi
tute a silver bill for the emergency tariff
bill will have the full indorsement of Re
publicans in all parts of ; the country. .; We
may say, even, that it has the approval of
all business .men, whether Republicans,
Democrats or Populists. In substituting
a silver bill for the bond bill all has been
done for the cause of ; bimetallism that is
possible in. this Congress. : The time has
now come to go forward to other things,
and any . further debate on silver coinage
in the Senate "at this session would be a
mockery > approaching the verge of down
right silliness.
It appears on the face of it, plain enough
for all to see, that the proposed : substitu
tion is but a Democratic trick to' defeat the
tariff bill. It is the hope" of the adminis
tration Senators to so divide the Republi
cans that no measure of tariff revision can
be enacted by Congress â¢ and sent to the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1896;
President. By this means they hope to
spare Cleveland the dilemma of having to
accept a new tariff, and thereby acknowl
edge the inadequacy of the present one, or
to veto it and thus incur the odium of con
tinuing the deficit in the revenues after
Congress had ;; offered a ) means ;. by which
they could be made f ally equal to the re
quirements of the Government.
It can be only through a partisanship
carried to the extent of absolute spiteful
ness that the ; Democratic Senators have
been led to take the position they have
assumed^ on this question. Their own
tariff has been tried and â¢ found wanting.
Month after month the official reports of
their own administration show an excess
of imports over exports, a continued ship
ment of gold to settle adverse balances of
trade and a deficit in the revenue. There
can be no longer any possible delusion on
the subject. A ; new tariff we must have
or else we must go on piling up the in
crease in the public debt, which, with the
latest bond issue, will already amount to
$262,000,000. V
. The bill which the Republicans offer for
tbe relief of the treasury is in no sense a
party measure. It is not and was not de
signed to be a protective tariff. It is purely
a revenue tariff intended to meet an
emergency, and could be supported by any
well-meaning Democrat without the sur-
render of his party principles. Such a
measure, conceived for the patriotic pur
pose of enabling all parties to unite in the
task of promptly providing revenues suffi
cient to overcome the difficulties that con
front the. administration, ought to have
been accepted even by the most stalwart
Democrats and promptly enacted. We
find, however, on the part of the support
ers of the administration nothing but op
position and hostility. It would seem as
if the deliberate intention [is to afford
Cleveland an opportunity for issuing even
more bonds and increasing the already
large amount of debt under which he has
placed the Nation. In such a scheme, or
anything that tends to the same result, no'
Republican should take any part upon any
terms whatever. The tariff and the silver
questions must be kept separate and nei
ther must be sacrificed to the other.
POP ULAR LECTURES.
Dr. Jordan, the newly elected president
of the Academy of Sciences, is redeeming
his promise of instituting a series of pop
ular scientific lectures, which will be both
interesting and instructive to the people
at large. "We want to popularize the
academy," he says', "and yet we want to
give thoroughly scientific information."
That directly to the point. In earnest
of his. intention he announces the follow
ing lectures: The Aztecs will be discussed
by E. J. Molera; Dr. Rosenau of Wash
ington, D. C, will give greatly needed
popular information concerning bacteria
in milk; Dr. Angel will give an insight
into the scientific basis of illusions and
hallucinations, and Professor Sanford of
Stanford University will expose the absur
dities of rain-making efforts. That is the
beginning of the new era in the academy.
All this is perfectly in line with the
tremendous movement of popular educa
tion outside the schools which has spruug
up within recent years in the United States.
It is a deplorable fact that while the
younger generation of Americans are pro-
vided with abundant facilities for acquir
ing knowledge, a large proportion of their
elders were compelled to arrive at maturity
in comparative ignorance. It is upon this
wide ignorance that charlatanism of most
kinds thrives, and in a measure lends a

The - Chautauqua represented the first
great movement in this country to
cure the prevalent evil of adult
ignorance. Its scheme is excellent and
complete. The next great organized move
ment was the university extension, which,
though working on different lines, is
achieving an equally valuable, result.
Other plans in variety . have come into
existence, and all are in recognition of the
great need of a better education as the
foundation of correctliving and intelligent
citizenship.
It is a very interesting fact that women
are far readier than men to take advantage
of the opportunities, and that in con
sequence they are steadily advancing and
leaving men behind. This is true par
ticularly of polite education as distin
guished from scientific and practical
knowledge. A few years ago a movement
was started for a series of lectures to or
ganized bodies of workingmen on the lines
of citizenship and political economy, but
as we have heard nothing of it lately^ we
fear that it has been abandoned. That
is to-day the most inviting field that is
offered for education of the people on
subjects vital to their private and public
lives. ' -.v.â
The Academy of Sciences would hardly
find such a line of lectures compatible with
its purposes, but still its promised lectures
so far should be regarded as excellent
opportunities for acquiring . valuable
knowledge. It is even possible to imagine
the academy the inspiration of a purely
philanthropic movement to provide for a
comprehensive series of lectures : on the
practical problems of life.
BALFOUR'S SUGGESTION.
The Right Hon. Arthur J. Balfour, First
Lord of the British treasury, has been hit
ting the English financial policy some
sharp raps of late, but he has never made
any suggestion so , sensational as that
which has just been meagerly reported as
coming from him. It was that the high
duty of England and the United States is
to 'â  work together, "each in its own
sphere," to promote and extend the "Anglo-
Saxon ideas of liberty. Then he made this
apparently inconsistent declaration: 7"lf
Great Britain were in alliance with the
United States, she could fulfill the duties
which Providence had intrusted to her
and not fear a foreign foe or international
diversions." \<
â In the absence of the full text of this
remarkable speech it may >, be deemed un
fair to criticize it, but a criticism ; can. be
made with : the ; reservation that its com
plete presentation might change its ap
parent character. >
The people of the United States would
be very glad to know in what respects the
Anglo-Saxon ideas of, liberty, are alike in
exposition in the two countries. It is not
difficult to find a wide range of divergences,
but that is not what Mr. Balfour is discuss
ing., In â¢ defining Anclo-Saxon ideas of
liberty, and thus I presumably separating
them from universal ideas of liberty, this
able Englishman ; would ibe compelled to
adopt either the' American or the British
.standard. ; If he should adopt the Ameri
can he would have to advocate the libera
tion of Ireland, abandon the Venezuelan
controversy and â  abolish a frefr- trade tariff
which makes England a nation of pauper
laborers : and millionaire usurers, , *If he
would ask us to accept the British idea he
would : expect jus jto seize Canada, overrun
the republics to the south of us and 'bring
our . laboring classes ' in competition with
the pauper workers of Europe and -the
Orient. , - v .; 7 â¢ ;7
: An alliance between Great Britain and
the United '( States I which would ; "enable
England to fulfill the duties which' : Provi
dence has entrusted to her" would, cer
tainly 7 be the crowning achievement of
England's ambition. To bridge the At
lantic with a treaty of alliance for : offense
and defense would be a spectacle to strike
terror to the heart of all the world. True
enough, England in that event need "fear
no foe," â¢; not even its dearest friend, the
United States; and 'she might even have
cause to hope that she could > see Ameri
can rifles led â¢by : English generals glis
tening in the sunshine of Calais and the
Balkan range. .'
"But the Atlantic is too wide to bridge
with American rifles" and English greed
for an extension of power. Whatever Mr.
Baifour may mean by Anglo-Saxon ideas
of liberty there are American ideas of lib
erty, and they are founded in justice and
humanity. It is these ideas that Ameri
cans are pledged to all posterity to main
tain, and they are not the ideas of liberty
that Great Britain cherishes.;' ;

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Ellen Beach Yaw, .'the altitudinous soprano
who passed her school days in Los Angeles, has'
at ; last sung before a critical New York
audience. For the last two years panegyrics of
the fair singer have been wafted from the wilds
of Texas And from the studio :of Alberto Ran
degger in London. Yaw's voice was said to be
the highest recorded in musical history, the
sweetest, the purest, and the lady herself was
declared to be possessed of a neck twice as long
as any one else's and to he moreover a girl ! of
surpassing beauty. Miss Yaw's recent New
York concert shows, as in the case of Marsick,
that the press agent occasionally overreaches
himself. The Musical Courier,' a paper* which
has "boomed" her extravagantly for the last
year and a half , says in the current issue : "Yaw
ELLEN BEACH YAW, THE ALTITUDINOUS SOPRANO.
[From an engraving.]
jumped Into fame in the first instance on : the
score of a sky-touching head register, which
ran ; away into D in altisssimo, outdoing
the Sandersons or Di Murskas of Eiffel
Tower notoriety. Miss Yaw, however, has
been injudicious. With the evident desire
to broaden her style and enlarge her volume
she has 'forced and strained the lower and
medium registers until the results are pain
fully false and diagreeable. There is a tone
that sounds like ventriloquist bass, in the
register above another stretch of voice that is
torn with ruthless thickness from the throat,
and then, with the result natural from the
abuse of. the registers, Miss Yaw's extensive
head voice has lost in purity and occasionally
grazes on something that is a little like a
squeak. This "is a great pity, as the singer
has certainly the phenomenal compass written
above, and by native right a pure, light,
limpid organ which might be made to do
novel and brilliant duty under proper control."
The Musical Courier's critic also advises Miss
Yaw to submit her voice to medical treatment,
and says if she fails to do so she will soon have
no voice to sing with. ' . :"'.â >â¢'"â¢ Vr.?;
And this is the result of press-agent booming
and of studying with Alberto Randegger. It is
only another proof, however, that the famous
London teacher, with his artificial' method of
fabricating contralto notes, is nothing but a
grand old charlatan. . ~- â¢ 7
News comes from Rome that, â¢In order to
cement the good feeling that exists between
England and Italy, a grand international mu
sical festival Is contemplated, consisting of
British works performed in a grandiose style
in the Italian capital, at which the composers
are to be invited to conduct their own compo
sitions. - Preliminary steps have already been
taken, and Mr. Visetti, whose name, by the
way, sounds quite Italian, has been ' sent from
the Royal College of Music, London, as a mu
sical embassador to Rome to arrange the details
of the plan. .It appears that a grave interna
tional importance is attached to this festival ;
but the two countries would do well to con
sider beforehand the danger lurking in the
scheme. Italy may take England very seriously
as a great naval power, but would she take her
composers seriously? Italian audiences are
proverbially critical, "and composers, British or
otherwise, are proverbially sensitive to crit
icism. llf : the musicians go home to London
shaking the dust of Rome from their feet, the
international consequences of the festival
would be the reverse of what is contemplated.
The Theater Royal of Budapest has solved
to the satisfaction of the management the
problem of how to prevent the husbands of the
prima donnas from putting their fingers in the
theatrical pie. j A short time ago there was a
"scene," arising out of , some trifling dispute
between one of j the fair singers and her hus
band, which retarded the raising of the cur
tain by half an hour, to the ' great indignation
of the audience. In spite of the fact that the
husband â¢in question . was a member of ' the
highest Hungarian aristocracy, Baron Noposa,
the : director of ;.. the Budapest Opera-house
promptly caused the following circular to be
printed and sent copies to all the husbands of
the prima . donnas : "Sirâ ln consequence of
recent incidents, which you are doubtless ac
quainted with, I find myself constrained to
adopt the following measures: The husbands
of prima - donnas '; can I only accompany their
wives to the stage door before the commence-
mentofthe performance, and come to letch
them when the opera is over."
A Budapest publishing-house, that of Rosza
volgyi& Co., has just undertaken a novel way
of popularizing the young Hungarian com
posers whose works it publishes. 2 The firm has
started a series of gratuitous concerts, at
which- the best available talent renders the
works of young, musicians. . The programme
of the ; first ? concert contained no less * than
thirty numbers, but the public, not deterred
by this array of music, filled the big hall and
stayed -until ) the last : note had ; sounded.
Among the works which the critics consider
remarkable were a prelude by Mihalovich to a
new lyric drama, a sonata for violoncello, by
Bator, and melodies by Jambor, Engel, Moore,
Zimray and J Kun. .' The intelligent I departure
of the Hungarian l publishing-house * has>'al
ready procured -" popularity ; for several un
known young .' composers. % Among | the execu
tants at :â¢ the concert . were some of the best
artists from the Royal Opera of Budapest. "

wonderfully "correct \ and vivacious manner,
the interpretation following somewhat in the

shown as a violin virtuoso. . His American ad

Ysaye more to Brussels and makes the project

. The Government secret service agents have
for" some time been trying to locate the place
where the numerous counterfeit hank notes
have been printed. At 636 Clay street is dis
played a sign which reads "J. C. Howe, Com

Little eight-year-old ' Rosie Silverwise,
while playing in an unfinished house on

to her home at 504 Fourth street by a lady
passing by, who chanced to see her fall.
Drs. Terry â¢' and Rosencrahz \ were sum
moned. They worked 7 over her until 9
o'clock, and at that time she was able to
speak and move her limbs.
She fell on her head, fracturing the
skull at the base . of- the brain. The
doctors believe there is every chance > cf
her recovery. j|sMlMS*teJ|^|MMg^
The father, I. Silverwise. a second-hand
clothes dealer, said Rosie had been play
ing^ in the building, with several other
children of ths' neighborhood, and was
throwing pieces of wood down through an
opening in the floor, when she lost her
ba.ance and fell twenty feet or more to the
ground.

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Walla Walla Made Record
Time in Her Run From
the Sound.
CAPTAIN FRANK TTJTTLE HERE
Three Captains With the Same Name
Who Are Troubled Over the
- Coincidence.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Walla Walla arrived from Puget Sound
ports yesterday in the remarkably fine
time of 58 hours 45 minutes. This is the
second best passage on record, and Cap
tain Gage is justly proud of it. Captain
Wallis, the commander of the Walla
Walla, is at present in the East attending
the annual convention of the Master Mari
ners' Association. Captain Gage has not
made a voyage as master for many years,
and he is naturally proud to be able to
show the rising generation of masters that
he has not forgotten how to handle. a ship
nor the shortest and safest course from
Flattery to the Golden Gate. â¢ 77.7,
Among the passengers on . the Walla
Walia was Captain Frank Tuttle, who has
been appointed to the command of the
revenue cutter Bear. He is well known in
San Francisco, having been for several
years master of the revenue cutter Hart
ley. He is one of the.most popular mas
ters in the service, a thorough seaman,
and a better man to succeed Captain
Healy in the command of the Bear could
not be found. Captain Tuttle will assume
command at once, and Captain Tozier of
the Corwin will take his place on the
Sound as superintendent of construction.
Desertions from the United States
steamer Adams since she came down from
Mare Island have been very numerous.
Over a dozen men are missing and squads
of sailors are patroling the front on the
lookout for their runaway companions.
The Monterey also lost a number of men,
but as she sailed at 7 a. m. yesterday for
San Diego any of her crew who are cap
tured will be put on the Adams.
The schooner Alexander got away for
Alaska with a cargo of general stores yes
terday. She is the first of the cannery
fleet to get away and goes to Kodiak for
the North American Commercial Com-
pany.
There are three captains on the water
front with the same surname and it causes
them endless trouble. There is Captain
Jones of the British ship Kilmeny, Cap
tain Jones of the British ship Aigburth
and Captain Jones of the British ship
Moel Try van. Strange to say, they are all
consigned to Meyer, Wilson & Co., and
that tends to complicate matters. When
Jones of the Kilmeny is wanted the
chances are that the messenger sent out to
hunt him up nine times out of ten will
brine back Jones of the Aieburth or Jones
of the Moel Tryvan. They also em
ploy the stevedoring firm of Stewart
Menzies & Co., and that gives rise to fresh
complications. Captain Jones telephones
that he desires certain information in re
gard to the handling of his cargo and
there has to be half a dozen questions and
answers before the real Jones is located.
The captains themselves have got so tired
of the endless conflicts of identity that
they have come to an understanding. Cap
tain Jones of the Kilmeny is now known
as "No. 1," Captain Jones of the Aigburth
as "No. 2" and Captain Jones of the Moel
Tryvan as "No. 3." Any message ad
dressed to Nos. 1, 2 or 3 in future will
always find the right Jones. -
The British ship Inch Keith, on which
eight guineas per cent reinsurance was
paid, arrived at Vancouver, B. C, yester
day. She was 140 days out from Java and
until she was spoken off the coast of South
America was considered a very doubtful
risk. :;|BÂ£&S
Edward R. Swan was appointed archi
tect to the Harbor Commissioners yester
day. He takes the place of the late A.
Page Brown, but will receive no remunera
tion from the State, as the arrangement is
that the estate of the deceased architect
must pay him.
Quite a fleet of coasters got in yesterday.
The fair wind brought in eight schooners
and one bark, all lumber-laden. They all
escaped the southeaster.
Captain McLeod, of the bark Rufus E.
Wood, was a proud man last night. He
had broken the record for the round-trip to
the sound and back, having taken a load
to Nanaimo, B. C, discharged it at its des
tination, took on another and got back to
San Francisco all in 19 days 5 hours. The
owners of the bark have a standing offer of
a suit of clothes to any of their men who
makes a round-trip in 25 days, and $100
and a suit of clothes to any master who
makes it in under 20 days. Captain Mc-
Leod has secured the latter bonus. The
ship Elwell is close behind the Rufus E.
Wood, and should she get in within the
next few days, the record will be broken
again. â  _^^
HALE AND NORCROSS CASE
Argument of Judge L. D. Mc-
Kisick Yesterday for the
Plaintiff.
Alleged Errors of the Supreme Court in
Its Reference to Testimony in
the Case.
In the Hale & Norcross mining suit yes
terday afternoon Judge L. D. McKisick,
one of the attorneys for the plaintiff, in
his closing argument reviewed the find
ings of the Supreme Court when it sent
the case back for rehearing. He held that
the- written opinion of the Chief Justice
in some instances was most remarkable
and seemed to come from an imperfect re
view of the testimony taken in the
lower court. He "remarked that the
records of the case nowhere, either by
plaintiff or defendant, makes any men
tion of the discount on silver, but the Su
preme Court's opinion returns the case for
a new trial with instructions that the dis
count on silver should be allowed. Coun
sel said that that matter was too remark
able and too foreign to the case for com
ment.
To show that Chief Justice Beatty was
wholly, mistaken as to the Hale & Nor
cross ores assaying $2 in silver to $1 in
gold. Judge McKisick rend from the tran
script of evidence', which showed an aver
age in the different assays of about 45
per cent in gold and 55 per cent in -silver,
a widely different result, from the calcula
tions of the Supreme Court. 7 The evidence
also shows that the battery and car assays
.were the same as to the proportion of gold
and silver.
The reason why the car assays were
higher than .the. battery assays was not
explained in the first trial, but is now ex
plained by J. R. Ryan's testimony that a
portion of the gold remained in the bat
tery and : did not show in ' the assay. '7 In
the first trial this, information, said coun
sel, was purposely suppressed, the bat
tery assays were incorrect and the court
was willfully deceived. ".;: 7
'â '- When Ryan ; was ; superintendent of , the
mine the railroad-car and mine-car assays
did not differ more than $1 or $2 per f ton,
the former being the higher, to wit: Rail
road, $55 50, and mine, $51 40. - This
showed i that the - mine-carl assays v. were
more correct. When 1 Robert P. Keating

was superintendent he did nothing when
the returns from the mill were falling
down.- That was* the* unfaithful servant.
When Ryan took charge he sent a man to
the mill who watched the returns.
was the faithful servant. The plaintiff
asked for a verdict upon i the report and
testimony of the faithful servant.
Counsel â â ' in â 'â '. his i argument referred to
about 10,000 tons of Consolidated Virginia
ore in 1895, when the railroad-car samples
averaged $57 56 per ton and the battery
samples $55 10. The ore worked ud to 83.30
per cent of car assays, while the plaintiff
claimed only 75 per cent of the Hale & Nor
cross ore. If Hale & Norcross rock had
been permitted to make such returns, this
suit would never have been started.
All through his argument Judge McKis
ick called attention to the Supreme Court's
erroneous references to the testimony given
in â¢ the lower court, showing that â  the
records of the trial, seemingly, had been
imperfectly read.
This morning Attorney Wood will begin
his argument for the defense.
GOLD MINING EXCHANGE.
Some Important Additions Made
to the. Association's
By-Laws.
M. F. Tarpey. Considers California the
Greatest Gold Field- in the
Entire World.
The first monthly meeting of the Gold
Mining Exchange | of San Francisco was
held yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock in
Assembly \ Hall of the Mills building.
President Turnbull presided.
The mines -and mining committee of
fered the following very important addi
tions to the bylaws: : ;., :7 V
ARTICLE XLIV.
EEQUIKEMENTS GOVERNING THE SALE OR DEVEL
OPMENT OF MINING PROPERTIES.
All applicants who desire to have mining
properties which are to be developed or sold
placed upon the book list of the exchange
shall rill out a descriptive blank (which shall
be furnished by the secretary of the exchange)
giving extent of improvements, if any, char
acter of the mine, kind and value of ore. title,
and any other iniormation which may be re
quired, and shall pay an application or a list
ing fee of $20.
The committee on mines and mining shall
examine and pass upon the application and
statement and, if necessary, shall also person
ally examine the -applicant. If the property
be considered meritorious by the committee
an expert mining engineer shall be appointed
by the committee on mines and mining, who
shall proceed, as soon as convenient, to the
property for the purpose of making a proper
examination, and he shall submit a written
report to the said committee, a detailed state
ment of the condition of the property as the â 
result of said examination.
Previous to the expert proceeding to make
an examination of mining property the owner
of the said property shall enter into a bond,
option or agreement to deliver such property
to investors upon such terms as may have been
agreed upon dv and between the mine-owner
and the mines and mining committee.
The cost of the expert examination shall be
tome by the applicant, but it shall not ex
ceed the sum of dollars per day and actual
traveling expenses. An amount of money ap
proximately covering the cost of his expert
examination must be deposited with the secre
tary of the exchange before the departure of
the expert.
Should the committee on mnes and min
ing, after' the examination and inquiry above
provided for have been made, then deem the
property submitted to its consideration to be
meritorious and a safe investment it may enter
into mutual arrangements, on behalf of the
exchange, with tne aforesaid applicant for
such material assistance as may be thought
proper. â¢
It shall be the duty of the committee on
mines ana mining to inform the applicant, at
as early a date as possible, what its decision
may have been. If favorable to the property
under consideration arrangements shall be
made lor selling the same by bond or securing
money for development purposes. All moneys
advanced for development purposes through
the recommendation of the exchange shall be
expended under its supervision; except the
party so investing shall elect to direct the ex
penditure of his money to suit his own ideas.
For consummating a sale of mining property
a commission of not less than â per cent shall
be added to the price ot the property, and said
commission must be paid at the time of sale,
and as shall have been agreed upon to the
secretary of the exchange, by the person in
whose behalf the sale is made.
A fee of not more than 50 percent of the sell
ing commission may be allowed a member of the
exchange who makes the sale on the consum
mation of a sale, but not more than 33)4 per
cent shall be avowed a non-member.
When required, the secretary shall furnish
non-members copies of reports of mines listed
on the exchange books, and reported upon by
the committee on mines and mining, at a cost
notexceeaing 25 cents per folio. A member
shall have the privilege, however, of obtaining
a report from the book list at his own expense.
The secretary or his assistants shall not furnish
reports to any one at the expense of the ex
change.
From the time the exchange shall enter Into
a contract for the promotion or sale of a prop
erty, all the details of the transaction shall be
open to both the seller and the purchaser.
The resolutions as read were unani
mously adopted. During the discussion
which followed M. F. Tarpey stated that
the aim of the exchange should be to pre
vent the burdening of the public as far as
possible with bad investments. He be

seeking legitimate investments in Cali

tion, he thought California would prove to
be the greatest gold field in the world, not
excepting South Africa. His remarks were
received with much enthusiasm.
The president announced that the
rooms of the exchange would be ready for
public business about the 15th or 20th of
the current month. The exchange unani
mously agreed that a fitting public open

The president was directed to appoint a

The Fight for the Paving of Folsom
Street "Will Be Continued.
The representatives of the South Side
improvement clubs held an enthusiastic
meeting at George D. Shadburne's office,
415 '. Montgomery street, yesterday after
noon. They denounced the action of
Mayor Sutro in vetoing the resolution
providing for the improvement of Folsom
street and = passed by the Board of Super
visors. It was decided to continue the
agitation in favor of a modern pavement
on Folsom street from the water front out
the Mission way. The following resolution
was unanimously passed:
Whereas, The Board of Supervisors did
unanimously pass a resolution appropriating
$35,000 for the bituminizing a portion of Fol
som street; and, whereas, his Honor the
Mayor, did veto the appropriation against the
wishes â of the entire south-side Mission dis
tricts, therefore be it .;
Resolved, That we, tho executive committee
of the combined Folsom-street and South Side
clubs, do request the Board of Supervisors to
pass this resolution appropriating $35,000
over the Mayor's veto, aud thus do | justice to a

EVIDENCE FROM THE SEA.
A Jury Dragged for the Bones
of the Sunken City of
Chester.
SHE IS FIFTY FATHOMS DEEP.
Going Over the Course Which Ended
So Disastrously That Foggy "7
Morning.
Strike a line almost due north from Fort
Point, and a cross line to the north of east
from Point Bonita, and where the two
bearings intersect is the spot over the grave
of the old City of Chester. For nearly
seven years she had slept peacefully in the
tideway, fifty, fathoms deep, but her rest
was broken for a moment yesterday, when
grappling-irons were let down to find if
she still lies cradled in the place where she
went down in August, 1888.
The seekers after information were the
! principal figures in the trial of the suit of
' the Hampton children against the Occi
-1 dental and Oriental Steamship Company.
They demand damages for the loss of their
parents, who were drowned after the
"We've got her," said Captain Whitelaw, as he and his man hauled hard on th<
line.
collision which sent the Chester to where
she now lies, on the bottom off Lime Point.
There was Judge Hunt, bis clerk, his
bailiff, his stenographer, the twelve good
men and true who are to decide the case,
plaintiffs' counsel, defendant's counsel,
some of defendant's witnesses, one .of
plantiffs' experts, some, of the jurors'
friends, Captain Whitelaw, who | was to
find the sunken vessel,. Captain Metcalf,
who commands the Oceanic, Pilot Meyer,
who brought her in on the fatal morning,
and some boxes brought by counsel for the
defense, the contents of which were after
ward used to stay the appetites 'and slake
the thirst of tne wreck-hunting party.
The case had reached that point where
it became necessary ; to . know the exact
snot where the Chester lies. Plaintiffs'
attorney, T. M. Osmont, contended that
she lay in close to the fort, showing that
the Oceanic had been running in close to
the south shore, and was therefore off her
course. General Barnes, for the defense,
attempted to prove she went down close to
Lime Point, showing she collided with the
Oceanic over by the north shore, and that
the Oceanic was therefore in her proper
place in the channel. Captain Whitelaw,
the wrecker, swore he had located the hull
of the Chester in fifty fathoms near Lime
Point, and he said he could go there any
time and drop a lead on her deck. General
Barnes supplemented this with an offer to
take the court and jury out to the point
and see Captain Whitelaw drop his lead,
and the offer was immediately accepted.
The Vigilant had a tow on hand for the
morning, and so when she finally drew up
at -Mission pier the whole party had as
sembled. Facetious comments "had been
passed back and forth as to the court's
ability to have the tugboat up for con
tempt, but the difficulty of getting her to
the courtroom seemed insurmountable,
until W. H. Pratt, who has been Surveyor-
General, and so was allowed a certain
amount of license, mildly remarked that
the shorthand man could take her down.
Even the tug whistled and Mr. Pratt went
on board and hid behind the smokestack.
It was slack water about 11 o'clock and
by that time the tug had reached Lime
Point. Under Captain Whitelaw's orders
she maneuvered back and forth until a
flagstaff on the fort was in line with a lone
peak on the lower range of hills, the tower
of the Bonita light was just open from the
lowei hummock of Point Diablo and the
big "needle" was in line with a small
white house on the slope beyond. These
were Captain Whitel.aw^a three ranges and
the tug was just at the point where they
crossed each other.
The captain hurried from the bridge to
; the forward deck, while the jury gathered
round in breathless interest. A common
window-weight of about. fourteen pounds,
to which was attached a four-pronged
grappling â hook, â  was attached to the end
of a coil of stout hemp rope. Whitelaw
glanced round at his ranges once more.
"We're right over her," he said, and
without hesitation he and his assistant
heaved the grapnel over the tug's side.
It plunged downward until it seemed as
if the line would never stop squirming out
of the coil. Two hundred and 250 feet ran
out and then , fifty ll feet '.: more, and it
stopped. Captain Whitelaw. grasped i the
line and began to "feel", it, as , hewouid
handle a fish.. He hauled it in, payed it
out, and hauled it in again, until finally it'
stuck. He put his foot on the gunwale,
and he and his â â < man : pulled hard. â¢. Then
he slackened. the rope. "We've got! her,"
he said, and handed the line over to the
jurors. â  :â ':â â 'â  *-'â :.'. â .' :i -:'.'
The jurors pulled and strained, but the
rope held fast. Captain Whitelaw ; felt lit
again, and after 7 working the line awhile
he said he felt the hooks slipping on some
thing which, he thought, was an iron fore
stay or mainstay. "He 7 was about to ex
plain just how he reached this conclusion,
when Mr. Osmont stopped him. , .
, "If your Honor please, I object,": he
said.* s "The captain must not lead 7 the
jurors. They must see for themselves." â¢â â ;-'
The : court, i standing upon the 'bridge,
issued an ; order: accordingly, and so Cap
tain Whitelaw retired, while > the ; jurors
hung over the side and. worked at the line.
They ran out about \ sixty feet, thinking
the weight; had found some new hole in
the bottom, but it :- was only the sweep of
the ebb tide curving the rope in a big bend
toward the ocean. ; Then the jurors started
to pull it in.
"It's the first time we have earned our
$2," said one.
, "It's good this jury. has a pull," re
i marked another. ' -. -
7" Lets select a foreman and send him
down to report," suggested a third, i
But the line â â  seemed heavy, and there
was soon no spare breath in the jury as it
pulled stolidly at : that seemingly endless
line. 7 Finally the â¢ rope r stopped. It } was
up * and down, so - the end juror ; made it
fast, to a stay unt'l a future course could be
decided upon. 7Tn. the meantime the tug,
rising upon a long, lazy groundswell,
solved the problem herself by snapping
the rope. ',,: It broke somewhere away down
under water, and when the end came over
the roil it was found that the rope had
been fairly pulled apart. There was no
cut or chafe about it. ,
;; "That; rope ought to hold 500 pounds,"
said Captain Metcalf, and Captain White
law was willing to swear on anything that
his best grappling-iron was fast in the
rusting iron rigging of the Chester.
The frayed end of the rope was cut off
and kept as "exhibit A," and after the tug
had been brought around and once more
put head to tide and in the point of the
three ranges another iron was thrown
over, this time by: one of the jurors, and
the twelve peers each took a turn at feel
ing the line as it disappeared rapidly un
der the water.
J. F. G. Jackson was the last man on the
line. As he held it the iron struck bottom.
He pulled it up a few. feetâ it stuck. He
let it down and tried again. Once more it
resisted. "We've got something again,"
he said, and again the jurors crowded
round the little rope that ran down among
no one knew what sights or sounds.
There was something weird and uncanny
in the feeling for the bones of the ruined
vessel, so far beneath where there were
life and sunshine.
Then the line was turned over to White
law, and he had the tug moved here and
there, while he pulled and hauled on the
rope, and then with a, grunt of satisfaction
he commenced to reel in hand over hand
until the iron came up to the rail once
more. The book was unchanged, but the
bit of baling rope by which j it was lashed
I to the weight was torn and chafed. On
' the rough surface of the weight itself were
I little smears of red and brown. Some said
paint, some said rust, but the weight kept
its own counsel as to where it had been,
and the jury could only wonder. " 7 ::
Then the tug was run ahead a bit, so the
iron could be sent down where it was
known there was no vessel, and once more
the weight plunged its prying, fingers to
ward the bottom. It could not be made to
take hold, and the jury hauled it in again
and sat round on the rail and discussed
matters. '.''. .â v;7Â» "7
The tug then started for the outside
basin, so as to come in over the course the
Oceanic took the morning she collided
with the Chester. A heavy : groundswell
was running in through the channel, and
the tug buried her nose in the advancing
water and threw spray over herself in a
way to make the party shriek in delight,
that is, all but General Barnes. He sat
enthroned on a coil of rope on the forward
deck examining the shore intently, until
he remarked to no one in particular:
"I don't feel nearly as hungry as I did
when we struck these waves. I think we
had better turn round."
.The tugs head was turned homeward,
and under the guidance of Captain Met
calf and Pilot Meyer, she ran in on the
course taken by the Oceanic upon that
foggy morning in August, 1888. They
passed once more over the spot where they
had grappled for the Chester, and then
veered off through Raccoon Straits and
around Angel Island. Once in smooth
water the boxes brought by the defense
were opened and the lunch was spread.
Fred Vaughn, clerk of the court, had the
only plug hat on board, so he was given
the head seat at the table, and Dave Mag
ner, the bailiff, was sent around to gather
the jury and the guests. Lunch was over
as the Vigilant reached the wharf, and the
jury, was dismissed until this morning/;.
The jury, is non-committal, as befits its
judicial character, but it was evident the
grip that some hidden thing held on
the grappling-iron had made a deep im
pression on the jurors' minds. Captain
Whitelaw swears the thing was the Ches
ter, and Captain Metcalf and Pilot Meyer
say it could have - been nothing else. At
any rate it was somethingâ something
with a mighty grasp, just such a hold as a
rusting, rotting hulk, deep in ..-; the sea,
would take upon a messenger from the
world above. It was a grip like the grip
of death.
WILL VISIT THE HOSPITAL.
Supervisors to Investigate the Sanitary
Condition of a .Public Institution,
'. '.,; The Hospital Committee of the Board of
Supervisors decided yesterday to visit the
City and County Hospital in company
with the members of the Finance Com
mittee, some -time during the next few
days, to look into the sanitary condition of
the City's refuge for the sick! This action
was brought about by a communication
from Dr. Stahl, ; the Superintendent, who
called attention to the urgent need for im
provements, and asked for an ; increased
appropriation to put the hospital in habit
able condition. He stated that -not only
was the institution ma bad sanitary con
dition, but that, on account of its age, it
was growing worse steadily, and is already
unfit for the habitation of healthy human
beings, to say nothing of persons in an en
feebled condition from disease.

WAR WAGED ON WHEELS.
Bicycles and Bicyclists in the
Tight Clutches of the
Law.
TWENTY-ONE LADS ARRESTED.
Initial Effort by the Police to En
force the New Bicycle Ordi
nance.
Cycling residents of the Mission are in
a state of boiling indignation. Last night
no less than twenty-one of them were cut
short in the midst of their whizzing career
and cast into prison by. the hard-hearted
minions of the law. Twenty-one free
American citizens they were, and they pro
tested loudly as they gave in their names.
F. P. Molloy, G. W. Hicks, H. Waltman,
William Neal, W. H. Mack, Alfred Coutre,

Brown, Albert Arens. Louis Adler, T. W.
Boyd, Archibald Reid, J. T. Whelan, E. E.

Thomas, Richard L. Radkeand E. Loudeck
were the unfortunates. They were ar
rested at various times during the after
noon and evening, the majority being
taken in after nightfall.
Captain Gillin of the Seventeenth-street
police station was kept busy entering the
names of his unwilling guests on the regis
ter, while little by little the station com
menced to take on the appearance of a
bicycle warehouse. Twenty-one "wheels"
of various makes and differing degrees of
excellence, each machine tagged with a
card bearing its rider's name, were dis
tributed over the floor of the station
house. I" each case the wheeler was
caught on the run and the wheel
was invariably taken into custody as well,
to be held as evidence, the officers said.
The wheels, in fact, fared worse than the
wheelers, seeing that the latter, for the
most part, succeeded in obtaining their
release on the payment of $20 cash bail,
while the machines were in every instance
held tight in the unrelenting clutch of the
law. in which clutch they still remain.
"Did you get that $20 yet?" asked a boy
ish voice, and a beardless face appeared at
the tiny wicket in one of the cells. Young
Loudeck had caught -sight of a friend
whom he had sent to his home for the
cash requisite to secure his liberation.
"The folks were out spending the even
ing," answered the friend, whereat Lou
deck's countenance fell; "but I guess
they'll be back soon. I left a note for
j them.".. "-.. .Â£7' --. r. â¢ 77. r -/â :.<
"It's a shame, anyhow," exclaimed
Loudeck. ready to cry vvith vexation.' "I
was creeping along as slow as could be,
and the cop was hiding behind a tree and
jumped me as I passed him."
From another cell came a wailing duet,
also in boyish cadence, from the sweater
muffled throats of Masters Arens and
Phelan. ' '."'â¢'
"Are we going to stay here all night, I
should like to know?" inquired Phelan,
with a groan.
"I'm sure I don't know," responded
Arens in a tone no less lugubrious.
"Never mind, boys," chimed in Arens
Sr., who stood outside the wicket adminis
tering what consolation he could to his son
in bonds. * .
"If Judge Campbell doesn't release you
soon I'll bail you out, neve r fear.''
This ray of hope seemed to comfort the
boys, who resigned themselves the cir
cumstances as gracefully as they could.
The officers state that- they are able to
prove a manifest violation of the bicycle
ordinance in each case. Either the boys
were riding too fast or neglected to ring
their bells when crossing points at the in
tersection of streets, so the officers claim,
and an interesting scene in court is an
ticipated when the offenders come up , for
trial.
The cyclers claim that they have been
singled out by the police as easy game,
since a man can be arrested on a bicycle
with the greatest facility by merely upset
ting his equilibrium, and, as one boy in
bloomers remarked pithily, "The more
men they pulls in the better their
chances is." -7
Others claimed that the California
Wheelmen's Club is the special object of
the policemen's persecuting zeal. At all
events, the devotees of the wheel are in
volved in a test case, which will serve as a
precedent for the future.
One young man, who was arrested, com
plains of his treatment at the Seventeenth
street police station. He says that al
though not riding fast he was put into a
cell by an officer who cursed him in a rude
way. He said : "I asked for permission
to telephone to my employer so that I
might explain the cause of "my delay, but
this favor was refused; my request being
greeted with derisive taunts. They also
refused to let me send a messenger to my
friends so that I could get bail."
A Genuine Philadelphia Joke.
: At a public dinner in Philadelphia some
years ago, the presiding officer, with a cigar
in hand, asked Mr. Evarts for a match,
meaning that that gentleman should hand
to him the box just beyond on the table.
When Mr. Evarts said, "I have none," the
presiding officer rejoined, "Very well, I
shall have to introduce as the matchless
orator from New York." And yet ? some
people say that Philadelphia is "slow."

THE GOVERNMENT
LIEN IS FIRST
Bonds of the Central Pa
cific Shown to Be
Subordinate.
DOYLE'S LUCID HISTORY.
Judge Thurman One of the First
to Note the True
Situation.
STRONG PROTEST TO CARLISLE.
Believed to Have Stopped the Payment
of the Railroad's Bonds by the
Government.
In view of the fact that there appears to
be far from a clear understanding on the
part of the general public relative to the
position of the Government and the Cen
tral Pacific Company as to the obligations
of the securities issued during the con
struction of that road, John T. Doyle was
yesterday asked to explain the exact rela
tions that exist. He gave what is proba
bly one of the most lucid expositions of
the matter ever published. His history of
these securities is as follows:
"In July, 1894, Congress passed an act
permitting the Central Pacific Railroad
Company and any other company author
ized to participate in the construction of
an overland railroad, upon the completion
of each section of its road, twenty miles,
to issue its first mortgage bonds on its re
spective roads to an amount not exceed
ing that of the bonds of the United States
issued to them, and of even tenor and date,
time of maturity and rate and character of
interest with the Government bonds. And
the lien of the United States was agreed to
be subordinate to that of the bonds thus
authorized to be issued.
"But, of course, as the Government had a
first lien on the road, and they permitted
these first-mortgage bonds to be made and
go in before the Government lien, with
these conditions annexed, the fulfillment
of the conditions was an essential pre
requisite to avail themselves of the privi
lege riven them by the act.
'You may issue your bonds,' said the
Government, 'with priority over ours, on
condition that you make the date the same
as the date we issue to you, the amount of
your bonds the same as the amount of ours, j

"The dates were not the same as the
Government bonds; the time of maturity
was not the same. In fact, none of the
conditions corresponded. Consequently
their bondsâ those they call their first
mortgage bonds â were not first-mortgage
bonds, and they never pot preference over
those of the Government, because they did
not comply with the conditions under
which the privilege was offered to them.
"Their excuse for this is that in the fol
lowing year Congress passed an act per
mitting them to issue '6 per centum
thirty-year bonds, interest payable in any
lawful money of the United States,' upon
their separate roads, and authorized them
to issue these bonds to the extent of 100
miles in advance of a continuous complete
line of construction.
"The Central Pacific people undertook
to understand this permission as a per
mission to issue first-mortgage bonds in
the way here described. But the law is
incapable of that interpretation. This lat
ter act authorized them to issue an en
tirely different kind of bonds, and to an
unlimited extent, but subject, of course, to
the lien of the United States.
"The first person whose attention was
attracted to this state of things was Judge
Thurman, and in the act which was passed
in 1878, which was called the Thurman act,
there is a recital . that the Central Pacific
Railroad Company has issued a Jot of
bonds, which if they have been 'lawfully
issued and disposed of would be a first
lien and take precedence over the Govern
ment debt.' But, of course, if they were
not ; lawfully issued and disposed of they
do not take preference. ;
"It only needs a comparison of the
bonds to see that tkey were not lawfully
issued. And as to their being lawfully
disposed of, the evidence before the Rail
way Commission showed . that they were
disposed of liKe the rest of the securities
of the road to the gentlemen who; act as
directors and managers, and who have ab
sorbed the whole assets.
"The bonds were called and quoted on
the Stock Exchange as first-mortgage
bonds and people seem to have accepted
them by that name, and they have been so
long called by that name that people
have forgotten 1 this ; deviation from the
license which Congress gave them.- ,-.'. v
"I discovered this discrepancy in study
ing this ? railroad ' question, ; and , l wrote a
letter to the Secretary of the Treasury in
May last calling his attention to the fact
that $2,995,000 of these bonds would come
due on the Ist of July last, on which; the
owners would apply; to him for payment,
under the Thurman: act, out of the sink
ing fund. I pointed out that they were not
valid first-mortgage bonds and should not
be so paid. v
"I received his reply saying that he had
referred the matter to the Attorney-Gen
eral for his opinion.
"The bonds have not been paid at the
treasury, from which I infer that Secre
tary Carlisle does not feel warranted in
paying them. ,
"I hear that Mr. Huntington has made
on i agreement with the owners to wait
upon him two or three years, but I know
nothing about the truth of the report."
:de winter tried again.
The Captain of the M. P. Grace Again
Answering a Charge of Brutality.
All the testimony in tie rase'Vf Captain
John de Winter of the ship M. P. Graci
was given yesterday bef-r.2 Judge Morrow,
and the cause was argued. The Judge is
to charge the jury this morning.
The case presents especial interest to
sailors, as this is the third time De Winter
has been arrested in this City on similar
charges after returning from long voyages.
In July, 1892, Captain de Winter and 'his
first and second mates were taken into
custody. They were released on heavy
bonds, but the case was continued, and the
crew went to sea, so the case whs finally
dismissed for lack of evidence. O.i return
ing from another voyage a month later, tie
captain and his second male were charge!

with brutal treatment. Again the case
was postponed and at last dismissed.
Captain de Winter returned to this port
about a month ago. Again some of his
sailors complained of brutal treatment.
Yesterday five . seamen swore they saw
Captain de Winter beat a seaman, Gus
Woward, over the head with a revolver
while the man was in chains. They also
testified to brutal treatment accorded
John Babis, another sailor. Captain de
Winter and live , other seamen testified
that the management of the shin was mild
and very pleasant.
IN THE COURT'S HANDS
Attorney Goodfellow's Argument | ]
in the Railroad
Case.
His Claim Is That Sidney M. Smith !
Must Stand by His Signed
Contract.
The suit brought by A. W. Foster, presi
dent of the San Francisco and North Pa
cific Railroad, and his associates, to enjoin
Sidney M. Smith from breaking his signed j
promise not to vote his stock in the com - ;
pany contrary to the manner in which his j
fellow-directors will vote at the coming j
election for directors, was argued and sub
mitted yesterday to Superior Judge An
gelotti at San Rafael.
Attorney Goodfellow, in behalf of Presi
dent Foster, had the closing argument.
He answered all the allegations of Attor
ney Page for Mr. Smith, made the day,
previous, citing authorities to back his ar
gument.
He stated that "No man can perform
his duty to his fellow-man if he don't carry
out his agreements unless the law compels
him to do so."
In answer to the assertion made two
days ago by Attorney Page, that even if
the court granted the restraining order, it
could not compel Smith to attend the
meeting and vote for Foster, Attorney j
Goodfellow said: "The court can compel
Smith to be sent to jail, have his estate
j sequestrated, or could simply appoint the
i clerk of the court as commissioner, with
directions to cast Smith's vote at the meet
ing."
In closing his argument asking that the
plaintiff should be granted the injunction
Attorney Goodfellow said: |
"An aereement for voting shares of stock j
in combination is not illegal or contrary
to law. If supported by no other consider- j
ation than the consent of the parties con- j
cerned any one can withdraw, but, if sup- j
I ported by an independent consideration j
l and under such conditions that the with
j drawal of one is injurious to the others,
I such an agreement cannot be abrogated
| without the consent of all.
"In this case a breach of contract by
Smith would ; result in a change of
management and policy of the corpora
tion and would produce a resulting injury
which could. not be accurately estimated
aud compensated by damages."
It was stated to the court that the meet
ing of directors of the railroad company
could be ; postponed from week to week,
beginning next Tuesday, when the elec
tions should be held.
"Postpone vonr elections, then, for two
weeks," stated the court. "I will decide
this case two weeks from next Monday.":
Everybody Buying Corn.
Everybody in Kansas is buying corn,
says* the St. Louis Republic." Bankers,
speculators, grain-buyers, merchants,
farmers, editors and others who can scrape
together a few dollars are putting it into
a pot 'with their neighbors and buying
corn with it." Empty railroad -'-' cars . are
standing idle all over the State. The rail
roads are not. complaining, for they Know
they will get the business some time. Very
little corn is shipping out of the State. In
the towns ; along the â¢ lines fof : railways a
new corncrib ? may be ; seen at the rear
of ; nearly :"_' every home. . . ; Men and
women who can raise a few dollars are

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1896.
THE DESERT BORAX KING.
Arrival of Frederick Conn,
Owner of Beds in the
Saline Valley.
WHY THE MARKET IS DOWN.
Mr. Conn Says the Coast Product This
Year Will Be Between 7000
and 8000 Tons.
Frederick Conn of Big Pine, Inyo
County, . cue of the borax kings of the
country, is at the Russ. He was formerly
one of the owners of the Columbia borax
beds and is now in possession of the ex-
tensive borate of soda beds in the Saline
Valley.
These are about six miles wide by twelve
miles long. The borax covers the earth
like snow and lies at a depth of from six
to twelve inches.
Mr. Conn, who was seen yesterday, gave
an interesting story of the extent of the
borax beds as existing at present, the prod
uct and reason for the depression of the
market. He has been an owner in borax
mines for fifteen years, so that he speaks
with authority.
He siys that Frank Smith, the Oakland
borax king, who owns borax mines in
Death Valley and at Calico/is responsible
for the recent big drop in the market. He
had a big contract recently with heavy
borax-dealers in New York. He wanted
to get another contract, but was underbid.
Then Smith put down the' price, which
persisted in remaining down once it had
been interfered with.
"Our mines in Saline Valley are borate
of soda, and nearer pure than any other
on the coast," said Mr. Conn. "There is
some salt and sulphates. The beds run
from 20 to 70 per cent of borax.
"We sell a great deal of borax to St.
Louis, Chicago and Kansas City. There is
a porcelain-ware manufacturing company
in St. Louis which buys in large lots of us.
We also sell a great deal to the Cutting
Packing Company of this City and to Ar
mour & Co., for use in preserving meats.
i It has been found very useful for this pur
i pose.
"The borax is now worth 2% cents a
pound for refined and 5 cents for the con-
I centrated. The borax has been ns high as
7% and 8 cents. The way it is there is
i nothing like as much money in the busi
| ness now as formerly, but probably this
| will not last long.
"The borax of this country is confined to
the coast. The mines owned by Smith are
what are called colmamte, from Coleman,
the pioneer merchant, one of whose men
discovered the. beds. They give 35 per
cent of boracicacid.
"There are some beds north of Reno, in
Nevada, and there are also some fifty miles
north of Lovelocks. They are borate of
lime, and not very extensive. The beds
are of a grayish white color.
"The output of all the borax beds a year
is between 7000 and 8000 tons. The prod
uct this year will probably be close to
what it has been hitherto."
Mr. Conn says it is extremely hot as a
rule where his big beds are situated. Not
infrequently the thermometer reaches 120
or 130 degrees, but the air is very dry and
therefore ?he heat is not so fierce as might
be supposed.' Mi. Conn will be here for
some time. . Mr. Trude, who is an owner
with Mr. Conn, is here with him.
CALIFORNIA'S PRODUCTS
A Fine General Display to Be
i Made Soon at 16 Post
Street.
A Protest Against a Private Exposi
tion Scheme Located in New
York.
Since the return of J. A. Filcher, man
ager of the State Board of Trade, from 1 thai
Atlanta exposition, he has been a very
busy man. He is making preparations for
one of r the \ finest permanent exhibits of
California products ever displayed | in this
City.
; Before his return the directors engaged
the premises at 16 Post street, formerly oc
cupied by the Builders' Exchange. 7 There
is a fine opportunity for . displaying ex
hibits to their best advantage, as there ii
a large amount of ffoor space and plenty of
light from 1 tbe skylights.
The exhibit tnat was taken to Atlanta
will arrive here soon, two carloads having
already come in. Some of : the fruits pre
served in large jars may have been spoiled
by the Georgia climate, for during a large
part of the time of the exposition the mer
cury ,was down - to zero and the; liquid pre
servative became congealed. ' 77
The permanent exhibit will not be placed
in the new Post-street quarters : until the
15th inst. "r,..,' - 'â â  â  >?^^*pag|p^By
'â ;'*ln the meantime Mr. Filcher will secure
additional .products."; Letters 7 are ; being
sent out to. all the patrons of the institu
tion to send in dried fruits, nuts, olives,
olive oil, the cereals and samples of min
erals of all kinds. Mr. : Filcher * says l that
the proposed exhibit will be more com
plete and.with a larger ; and better repre
sentation from all sections of ; the State -
than ever before exhibited.
. There is another matter that the Board
of Trade will be interested in. When Mr,
Filcher and? Frank Wiggins, Superintend
of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce,
were at Atlanta, they met several gentle
men connected with the Pure Food exhibit
I in Boston. The latter were very desirous
of obtaining an exhibit from this State,
particularly in the dried and preserved
fruit line. One of the gentlemen, a Mr.
Bond, said that now there are more beans
of California growth consumed in Boston
than are grown in the entire Bay Stateâ
and the demand is increasing.
Mr. Bond has recently written to Mr.
Wiggins asking what arrangements have
been or can be made for a California ex
hibit in the Hub. He offers a space of 40x
80 feet 25 feet in height. As the represent
atives of Northern : and Southern Califor
nia worked together and with such good
results at the Atlanta fair it is urged that
the two bodies take up the Boston propo
sition and send East a fine exhibit from
this State. Mr. Wiggins declares himself
in favor of the proposition; and believes
that such a display will excite a large and
healthy demand in the East for California
products. This matter will be taken up at
the next meeting of the Board of Trade.
During the past few weeks a large
amount of literature has been sent all over
the State announcing that there would be
a California State exhibit held in Madison
square, New York, in May. Mr. Wiggins,
in a recent letter to Mr. Filcher upon this
matter, writes:
I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Bond of
Boston, wherein he incloses a slip trom a New
York paper, the same I inclose. You will note
that it treats of a California State exhibit to be
held in New York in May. He wishes to know
if it is a legitimate affair and whether we will
be in charge.
I pronounced it a fake and an imposition, as
I know your board has nothing to do with it.
I think the matter should be taken up at your
next meeting and thoroughly investigated, and
the parties interested be compelled to with
draw the name "State of California." We have
had enough experience with private individ
uals using the State's name to further their own
interests. I think our friend Budd can take a
hand in the matter and put a stop to it. This
end of the country is flooded with the New
York advertisements, and I am beset daily with
people wishing to know who is representing
the State and whether the parties are respon
sible.
The advertisements mentioned by the
Los Angeles promoter are also distributed
freely in this City and the northern end of
the State. The "principal ad is about the
size of a magazine. The front page is
covered by a cheap wood cut in dark green
colors. The most striking feature is a
half-dressed scrawny female, and another
feu ale dumping a horn of plenty at the
thin female's feet. The heading is "Cali
fornia State Exposition."
In the list of executive officers is the
name "Charles H.Wood, California agent."
Who Mr. Wood is and what he represents
as a California agent Mr. Filcher does not
know. The subject will be taken up at
the next meeting of the Board of Trade,
and there is no doubt but what Mr. Wig
gins' suggestion will be acted upon.
VALLEY ROAD PROGRESS.
A Fifth Assessment leviedâ Contract
for Grading to the Merced River
. Awarded.
The directors of the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley Railway have levied
another assessment of 10 per cent upon the
stock of the corporation. The assessment
will become delinquent March 9, and de
linquent stock is to.be sold March 2G.
This makes the fifth assessment since con
struction was commenced on the Valley

the company to have only solid and endur

division engineer at Stockton in place of
J. S. Wilbur, who resigned.
The Quinine Industry.
The Agricultural Gazette of New South
Wales states that there is still living at
Kenmore in excellent health Mr. Charles
Ledee , the man who forty years ago after
most perilous adventures ; introduced the
variety of \ Cinchona * caliÃaya known \as
ledgerlana into the island of Java. Messrs.
Howard & Sons, the great quinine firm,
say that . the f supply ?of Peruvian : ; bark
from Java is almost all from the ledger
iana trees, the : only - complaint against
this :; variety being ; that it has turned out
so rich that the ' trees Â£ are , ! supplying % too
much/quinine* for 'the .world to consume/.
Perhaps the quantity of bark which vis

nished â :â  by Mr. " Ledger :: cannot i be ; short
of 1 10,000,000 ; pounds, i and Vto i him, more
thanÂ« any one else, perhaps, is due the
fact that quinine has been brought within
the means of the very poorest.
HOOKER-GOAD NUPTIALS
Society Attended a Fashionable
Wedding Yesterday
* Afternoon.
RARE BEAUTY OF THE BRIDE.
â ââ___ N
Married in a Bower of Roses in the
Presence of Several Hundred
Friends.
; --â â â¢-...
! Miss Ella Goad, eldest daughter of W.
Frank Goad, and Osgood Hooker, son of
Mr. and Mrs. C.G. Hooker, were married
yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock at the
residence of the bride's father on Wash
ington street.
Since the announcement of the engage
ment of this : fortunate and happy yonng
couple society has been discussing the
affair, which has proved all the more in
teresting on account of the romantic tinge
surrounding it. It is the romance of a
first and early love â a romance that ex
tends over a period of years with a happy
wedding for the final chapter.
The Misses Goadâ Aileen and Gene
vieve on account of their rare beauty
of person and mind, have frequently
been alluded to as the "three graces."
The elder sister, the bride of yesterday,
among her numerous other accomplish
ments enjoys rare distinction as a tactful
and charming hostess. Like her mother
before her she has gained an enviable
reputation as a dinner-giver, and all the
functions at which she has presided were
characterized by taste, novelty and a rare
savoir faire.
In the midst of her social duties the
poor have not been neglected, and more
than once she has placed the elegant home
over which she presided at the disposal of
charity.
The Goad residence, 'which has so often
been the scene of numerous brilliant en
tertainments, was lavishly decorated for the
wedding. No set arrangement was ad
hered to. In all the apartments fragrant
blossoms in costly vases, jars and bowls
were freely distributed. In the drawing
room, where the ceremony was performed,
it appeared as though all the gardens of
California had yielded up their treasures
to beautify the room. The immense mir
ror that completely covers the north wall
of the room was completely hid behind a
trellis-work of American Beauty roses. It
was here, with this rose wall lor a back
ground, that the young couple stood while
Rev. Dr. Foute of Grace Church read the
marriage ceremony that made them man
and wife. ; 7
No prettier sight could be imagined than
the picture presented as the bridal party
came down the grand staircase. First
came Robert M. Eyre, and at his approach
the ribbon- bearersâ Milton Latham, Max
McNutt, Ernest Folger and Nicholas Kit
tleâstretched the white satin ribbon across
the hall, thus forming an aisle for the
Misses Aileen and Genevieve Goad, who
officiated as bridesmaids and who pre
ceded the bride, who entered leaning on
the arm of her father, V. Frank Goad."
The groom was attended by his brother,
Robert Hooker. -
The bride looked like an exquisite paint
ing in her elegant bridal robe. The gown
was fashioned of white duchcsse satin.
The bodice was trimmed with rare old
point and finished with a high stock col
lar. The tulle veil was fastened to the
coiffure with a wreath of orange blossoms.
She carried a bouquet of lilies of the valley.
The Misses Aileen and: Genevieve Goad
were attired alike in white tulle * gowns
made over a white satin foundation. The
bodice was trimmed with tiny flounces of
Valenciennes, and the sleeves, moderate in
size, according to the latest Paris fashion,
reached to the ci bow. They carried im
mense bunches, of Jacqueminot roses, and
pinned to the coiffure by a bunch of white
blossoms was a soft tulie : veil that fell to
the waist.;
7 After the ceremony : congratulations
were in order, and the health of the young
couple was pledged in bumpers of cham
pagne. â¢ ;.::.â¢../.:;:-.'.; â¢â¢:â¢â  .77
The presents of the young couple were
numerous and elegant. :
Mr. and Mrs. Hooker left by last even
ing's overland for a -northern trip. On
their return they will; go to their cottage
at Sausalito, where they will pass the
spring and summer. w-
About 500 ? guests, the representatives of
San Francisco's \ wealth, beauty . and cul
ture, attended the wedding.
TALENT LOST TO THE COAST.

yesterday. He says that neither the Abbey

WENT OFF HIS BONDS.
F. T. Newbery and Thomas U. Sweeny
Refuse to Remain, as Sutro'a
, Sureties.
Thomas U. Sweeny and Frederick T.
Newbery lodged a communication with
the Board of Supervisors yesterday, in
which they stated that they had decided
to withdraw from the bond of Adolph
Sutro for the faithful performance of the
obligations of his franchise to conduct an
electric road to the Cliff.
No reason . was assigned for their deter
mination, but Mayor Sutro soon cleared it
up when he heard of the matter. s .
"The cause of Newbery's su'lden resolu
tion to go off my bond," said he, "is that
he feels angry because I discharged him a
few days a_o. . He was my surveyor. He
is gettinc superannuated, anyway, and we
have had a number of disagreements, that
led to mv dispensing with his services. I
suppose he thinks he will injure me by
this means out of revenge, but it don't
bother me a little bit. . The amount is only
$5000, and I can get plenty of people to be
my sureties, or if necessary put up the
money myself.
"Sweeny is sore because I did not treat
some grading ordinance relating to some
district in which he is interested as he
thought I should. He is getting old and
cranky, and I am not sorry he has for
saken me." I
TROUBLE IN THE ORDER
The American Benevolent Legion
Is Involve^ in Diffi
culty.
It Was One of the Concerns Recently
Sued by Insurance Commis- v
sioner Higgins.
Financial fortune has not smiled on the
American Benevolent Legion, and like Mr.
Micawber, it is waiting for something to
turn up.
, The "legion" was organized in June,
1894, by John S. Ryan, who is now supreme
chancellor. It is a benevolent society and
an insurance organization, and its mem
bership reaches to a thousand.
The American Benevolent Legion was
one of the insurance organizations which
in last November were sued by the In
surance Commissioner, the object of the
suit being the forfeiture of the society's
charter. The effect of the suit has been to
reduce the membership in the American
Benevolent Legion, and to prevent new
members from joining. As the member
ship falls off the source of revenue is re
duced, and the "legion" is not now in a
position to look forward with certainty.
Said Harry Malone, the supreme inspector,
yesterday:
The whole trouble has come upon us on ac
count of the suit brought by the Insurance
Commissioner. We are charged with doing an
open insurance business, when the by-laws ex
pressly forbid the issuance of certificates of
insurance to any but members of the organiza
tion. In last November a man named John
Duncanâ he was a detective applied for ad
mittance and insurance.. He then said he was
going away and if we would issue a certificate
he would join when he came back. The Su
preme Council is the only one which can issue
certificates, and the Supreme Council can only
issue such certificates after the applicant has
been passed by a subordinate lodge. Our su
preme chancellor, Mr. Ryan, issued, the cer
tificate on his own responsibility, and though
the board met as soon as it found what had
been done, still the suit had been commenced
and the matter became public. Mr. Ryan was
censured for his action. -
There ha 3 been other trouble in the or
ganization. The supreme chancellor left
for the East some time ago, leaving the
'â¢legion" in the hands of the other officers.
As Ryan was the man who started the
society and his substitutes had not fath
omed the needs of the association it drifted
downward. Ryan is still East and he has
been sent for to come home and run the
"legion," as it has got beyond the board
now in power.

GORMAN'S FALSE FRIEND.
A Miner From Idaho Robbed by Albert
Ivison,' a Confidence Man.
Albert I vison, a "sure thing" man, was
arrested on Tuesday night by Policeman
Mr. Osgood Hooker.
[From a photograph.] ,
Koegel on the charge of petty larceny.
: Yesterday morning he was identified in
the City Prison by John Gorman, a miner
from Idaho, and the more . serious charge
of grand larceny was registered , against
him. /
Gorman met Ivison in a saloon on How
ard street last Saturday night.. They be
came quite friendly ana Gorman began to
talk freely of his private affairs. He men
tioned that he had come to the City to dis
pose '! of , some mining stock, and asked
Ivison if he knew a certain speculator. 1
Ivison replied in the affirmative . and of-"
fered his ' services ; in finding him. They
started out on their search, but \ Ivison
' purposely failed to find the speculator.
Gorman .wks so pleased with his new
found friend that he invited him to share
his room in a hotel. â  ;
When Gorman . awoke next morning
Ivison had disappeared, and so had $43
from the pockets of Gorman's trovers.

A CLOSE SHAVE!
What J. Ward of Park Citj
Saw Close Ahead.
Ho Altered His Helm in Time, but None
Too Soon.
THE HISTORY OF NO r STATE IN THE
Union a hundred years to come will be
more interesting than that of Utah. The suc-
cessful camping-ground of the Mormons what-
ever else may be said of them, a greater power
in civilization), it has literally grown from a
sandy waste to a land "flowing with milk and
honey," ana now supports a cultured and in-
telligent race, who can indubitably throw the
cap of challenge into the arena of progress with
a good prospect of winning the laurels. Of
course, not all of the inhabitants of Utah are
Mormons, but the settlement of the Territory
primarily cannot be denied them.
Salt Lake City is said to be one of the pret-
tiest cities in the Union, but it is not the only
monument of the go-ahead spirit that Utah
possesses. Park City is certainly deserving of
mention. It has not a great population, but it
is beautiful, and its inhabitants are as clear-
sighted and keen people as possible. One of
themâ Mr. J. T. Wardâ came pretty near to
making a most serious mistake not many
months ago, though. He was suffering from a
serious malady, and he had neglected itâ as
people will sometimes doâ with the conse-
quence that his health became so impaired
that he was, as the sailors pui it, "right in the
breakers." But, to use another nautical
phrase, "he altered his helm just in time."
Neglect for a few days longer would have been
serious to Mr. Ward, but with his good, gen-
uine common-sense he placed his case in the
hands of the famous specialists of the Hudson
Medical Institute, that great curative estab-
lishment which has occupied the biz white
building at the junction of Market, Stockton
and Ellis streets for so long. When once he
had given them his confidence he wa3 secure,
and he felt it instinctively. To say thatbe was
cured is of course unnecessary, for bis case was
a curable one, and all curable cases are cured.
He has written as follows to the management:
PARK CITY, Utah, Sept. 4, 1895.
Hudson Medical Institute, San Francisco,
Cal.â Gentlemen: I am very pleased to say
that I am cured of the terrible disease which I
had, and I shall always speak a good word for
the Hudson Medical institute. . I forward you
some money now, and you can let me know in
your next letter what I owe you. Yours truly,
3 J. T. WARD.
This is plain evidence of the abilities of the
specialists of the Hudson Medical Institute.
But there are thousands of such letters re-
ceived monthly.
K. C. Taft of Stowe, Cal., says: "I am feeling
fine, without a sign of the disease- now."
F. Minturn, St. Louis, Mo.; "I desire to ex-
press my sincere thanks for the careful and
conscientious manner in which my case has
been treated by you."
E. W. Fowler, Kamele, Or., writes: . "I am
feeling as good now as it is possible for man to
feel."
Now, when these letters come so plentifully,
and they cover all classes of diseases, is it not
absolutely conclusive proof that if you can be .
cured the Hudson Medical Institute is by far
the best and most reliable place to go ? There
relief is CERTAIN.
All the Following Cases Are Cnrable:
Catarrh of the head, stomach or bladder; all
bronchial diseases; all functional nervous
diseases; St. Vitus' dance; hysteria: shakiag
palsy; epilepsy; all venereal diseases; all
kinds of blood troubles; ulcers; waste of vital
forces; rheumatism; gout; eczema; all skin
diseases, from whatever cause arising; psori-

digestion; constipation; all visceral disorders,
which are treated by the depurating depart-
ment. Special instruments for bladder trou-
bles. .-._-. \ ,
These are a few of the special diseases In which!
exceptionally remarkable cures have been mad*
by the specialists, and it may frankly be stated that
a helping hand Is extended to every patient

CHINESE QUEUES.
The Plaited Head Dress a
Badge of Imperial
Allegiance. '
MAY ITS -WEARER VOTE?
Native Sons in Chinatown Agi
tated Over a Serious Le
gal Problem.
A THOUSAND CHINESE VOTERS.
Movement in Chinatown for the Discon
tinuance of the Pigtailâ lts Real
Significance.
Shall the Chinese of San Francisco dis
card the queue?
its real significance is that of allegiance
to the Chinese empire. To appear in
China minus the queue is a sign of treason
and is met with death at the hands of the
public executioner.
But now a movement is on foot in China
for the abolition of the law requiring the
queue to be worn, and the Chinese in this
City as well as in China are agitated one
way or another on the question, Shall the
queue be discarded? ,
However, no precipitate action in the
matter is apprehended, and the question is
considered seriously only among the edu
cated Mongolians. Dr. Henry, a famous
missionary stationed at Canton, writes in
a current number of the magazine issued
by his missionary board that there are not
lacking evidences of reform even in the
eternal kingdom. He says:
The sir is full of hopeful signs of better times
for China. A manifesto has already been is
sued demanding (a) a change in the constitu
tional government, (b) the removal of inca
pable rulers, (c) the removal of the queue as a
sign of government allegiance, (d) the prohibi
tion of foot-binding. * * *
hat interests the inhabitants of China
town, however, is the probable or possible
result of this agitation upon the local po
litical movement among the Chinese.
Judge Morrow has decided that a Chi
nese born in this country is entitled, under
the law, to the privileges of the franchise.
But would Judge Morrow or any other
judge rule that a Chinese who still wears
the badge of allegiance to a foreign Em
peror is eligible as a citizen of the United
States?
There is considerable agitation on this
point already, and a decided movement is
on foot to challenge the vote of all native
Chinese who shall appear at the voting
booths on election day wearing a queue.
Or it may be that a test case will be
brought up in the courts before election.
Those who bold that a Chinese should not
be permitted to vote so long as he wears a
piÂ«tnil declare that it would be an analo
gous case' if the son of "English parents,
born in the United States, should take an
oath of allegiance to Queen Victoria and
then attempt to exercise his natal privilege
of franchise in this country.
Can a man be a citizen of two countries
at one and the same time?
Can a man who openly acknowledges his
allegiance to a foreign power be a patriotic
citizen of the United States?
Does Judge Morrow's decision go to the
extent of ruling that a native son of Chi
nese parents, who recognizes and affirms,
at least negatively, the sovereignty of the
Chinese Imperial Government, is eligible
as a voter in this Nation ?
May a pigtailed Chinese vote in San
Francisco?
These are questions with which the so
called "United Parlor of the Native Sons
of the Golden West" and some other citi
zens not members of that, order are grap
pling in dead earnest, arid tbe proba
bilities are that some legal steps will be
taken in the matter before long.
There are about 500 voters in China
town now, all members of this so-called
"parlor," and before election day the
Chinatown politicians expect to carry no
less than 1000 votes in their vest pockets.
At the last gubernatoral election 400
Totes cast either way would have changed
the result.' When 1000 votes can be handed
to this or that candidate for this or that
consideration those votes become a power
and a menace at the same time.
Those who have raised the issue declare
that the only object the Chinese had in ex
ercising the franchise is to fight the anti-
Chinese laws of this country. Once it was
possible for a Chinaman to become a nat
uralized citizen, but at that time there
, were no hostile laws regarding the Chinese,
and, therefore, the Chinese took no advan
tage of the opportunity. Now that the re
striction laws have been passed and en
forced the Mongolians see their mistake,
and this new move toward the registration
of the native sons of Asiatic parentage is
in the direction of acquiring political
power to fight this class of legislation. â¢
Of course, the "parlor" of Native Sons in
Chinatown holds no charter or authoriza
tion from the Caucasian order of Native
Sons, but it has organized under the laws
of the State, and has secured articles of in
corporation. All the members of this
"parlor" wear queues; all of them claim
to be voters, and half of them have already
voted at a prior election.
Of course it will rest with those who in
tend to challenge the right of these Chinese
to vote to prove that the queue is in real
ity a badge of political allegiance to a
foreign power, but this task, they claim,
will not be difficult. Chinese literature
and laws will themselves prove the point
abundantly, they declare, and any one who
has lived for a time in ' China knows the
meaning of the queue. - >--â¢â¢'
The Rev. F. J. Masters, D.D., superin
tendent of the Methodist Episcopal
Chinese Mission in this City, has been a
resident of China and is well posted on
the manners and customs of the , Mongo
lian. When asked concerning ;â  the signifi
cance of the Chinese queue, Dr. Masters
said: SSHnfiÃtfl
"The Chinese custom cf wearing a queue
is political rather than religious. 7lt had
its origin at the time of the Tartar con
quest of China in 1664. Up to that: time
the Chinese had been accustomed to wear
the hair long and unplatted, twisting it
fc. into a tuft or coil on the* top of the head to
get it out of the way. The new Govern
ment had to deal with a hostile and sullen
people who could not be conciliated into'
submission.
"Soon after the new Emperor came to
tbe throne an edict was issued requiring
all persons who desired to be known as his
loyal subjects to plait the hair at the back
of the head, arid shave the front part, alter
the custom of i Manchuria. The queue at
once and forever became the differentiating
mark of allegiance to the Manchu "dynasty,
and all who retained the Meng coiffure
were regarded as disloyal.
"At first ; the 'order exasperated, the
Chinese, who looked upon it as a badge of
humiliation, and it "was nearly a hundred
years before the custom was generally
adopted. Rang Hi, the second sovereign
of the present dynasty, found-it necessary
to offer rewards and immunities to- the
natives of outlying districts that had re
fused to submit to the new order.
"When it became manifest that there was
no possibility of a restoration of the Meng
monarchy, when it was seen that queue
less persons never had any snow in a court
of justice or any chance of success in the
library examinations, the people yielded.
Ever since then a man with unbraided hair
has been looked upon as a rebel and liable
to arrest and decapitation. At the present I
day in China every Chinaman not in open
rebellion wears a queue. What was once
a degradation is now a mark of respectabil
ity. With the exception of priests, a
Chinaman without a queue would be held
up to universal execration.
'.'That the queue is the badge of allegiance
to the Emperor of China is evident from
the fact that the first act of the rebels in
the late Tai Ping rebellion was to unplait
the hair and wear it in Meng dynasty
fashion. The local Chee Kune Tong in
Spofford alley, the so-called Free Masons,
is a rebel secret society and on being ini
tiated into its secret rites the neophyte al
ways unplaits his queue while reciting the
oaths renouncing allegiance to the Tartar
sovereign. iuftfflÃjgK
"I have never urged a Chinaman resid
ing in this country to shave off his queue
for this reason. Our laws do not permit
his naturalization and, to urge him to re
move his queue would be to denationalize
him and leave him practically without a
country.
"Some Chinese while residing here have
found it more convenient to dress their
hair in our style, but before returning to
China they have always been careful to
grow the hair long enough to enable them
to attach a false queue, and they have as
sured me that to go about the streets of
China without a queue would subject them
to imprisonment.
"You ask if my view is corroborated
by any other missionaries? Yes; by
Williams in his 'Middle Kingdom,' by
Doolittle in bis 'Social Life of the Chi
nese,' by every missionary in China and
by every authority on Chinese customs."
"Have you ever heard that the queue
has any religious significance?"
"Never! It is not the mark of initiation
into some religious order or caste. It is
not analogous to the sacred cord of the
Brahmans. That this is not so is apparent
when it is considered that all the images
of their gods are without queues, and so
are their priests. The Buddhist priests,
like the Buddhisatvas they worship, are
shaven and shorn, and the Taoist priests
wear their long hair, twisted around a
wooden comb at the back of the head."
The Rev. Mr. Condit, superintendent of
the Presbyterian Chinese Mission, who
lived in China six years and traveled
through the country considerably, who
speaks the language and is well versed in
its literature, holds the same view as to
the significance of the queue.
"It is unquestionably a mark of polit
ical allegiance," said he, "though I would
not like to say that all Chinamen who
wear the queue wear it for this reason.
I think, rather, that many iof them cling,
to the queue merely as a custom." V;"^'
â However, those who agitate the matter
now, declare that a man who seeks to cast
his ballot in America should at least be
willing to forego a custom that smacks ;
strongly, to say the least, of imperial
sovereignty.
THE AFFILIATED COLLEGES
Regents of the State University
Discuss the Various De
signs.
Judgment of Three Non-Competing
Architects Invited by the
Committee.
A committee of regents of the State Uni
versity held a long session yesterday after
noon at the Mark Hopkins Institute of
Art. The five designs for affiliated col
leges recently submitted by architects were
discussed. The committee consisted of
J. West Martin, Colonel C. F. Crocker,
j General Houghton, Timothy Guy Phelps,
I J. B. Bernstein and the secretary, Dr.
j Bonte. Among others attending to hear
the result of the committee's deliberation
were: Major Mboon, attorney of the
board of regents; Columbus Bartlett; Dr.
R. Beverly Cole, president of the medical
college; O. P. Evans of the law college;
Professor Dunbar, dean of the dental col
lect ; Melburne M. Searby, dean of the col
lege 01 pharmacy; Br. Skaef, the dean of
the veterinary college ; George T. Marye,
Frank Powers, the competing architects,
and several college representatives. ,
The architects and college representa
tives were admitted singly to the commit
tee-room, and each had a 1 fair hearing.
After a long discussion on: ground plans,
i interior space, decorations, general fitting
and estimates of probable cost the commit
tee decided to refer the matter to a com
mittee of three architects. It was resolved
to request Albert M. Pissis, Clinton Day
and Walter J. Matthews to serve on this
committee.
This resolution did not appear to meet
with the universal favor of the architects
assembled. There was an impression that
Clinton Day, a university man, was in
clined to favor the plans proposed by
Architect Sutton. It is said that Mr. Sut
ton's design has many admirers among the
regents, and that to counteract the . influ
ence favorable to his plans and to ad vance
the fortunes of Architect Pelton O. P.
Evans was on the scene. ; Attorney Frank
Powers was reported to be an advocate of
Sutton's cause on; the chief ground that
the latter is not only a capable architect,
but also a graduate of the State Univer
sity. , The gossip goes that Governor Budd
has unbounded faith in Architect Pelton.
The Stockton Free ; Library building was
designed by Mr. Pelton, and the designing
of that v edifice meets the full .measure of
the Governor's conception of architecture.
: Dr. Cole has studied the plans presented
by Mr. Sutton: and says that the archit ct
prepared them after elaborate survey and
close detail inspection of modern .< colleges
of the East. ;' Â°~:-
--â 'â  The committee made diligent inquiry as
to the cost of the buildings, and each archi
tect called in, speaking for his own plans,
assured â  the regents I that - the "â¢ cost would
not exceed the sum of money appropriated.
â  Another meeting of the committee will
be held next Saturday. ;On Tuesday next
the board of regents will meet and at that
meeting one of the five designs submitted
will probably be chosen. 7'

THE SAy FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1896.
SUTRO SELECTS A SITE
Has Offered a Location for the
Wilmerding Training
School.
IN FAIK RICHMOND DISTRICT.
An Entire Block on an Elevation to
Be Devoted to the Buildings
and Grounds.
Mayor Sutro has selected a site for the
Wilmerding School of Manual Training,
The Site Selected by Mayor Sutro for the Wilmerding School.
[The shaded portion indicates the block.]
which it is supposed will be located in San
Francisco, and has offered the trustees of
the Wilmerding bequest a free gift of the
property.
The site comprises an entire block on
Thirty-second avenue, in Richmond,
known as block 315, and is admirably situ
ated for such a purpose, being on rising
ground that overlooks Golden Gate Park
on the south and the Presidio reservation
on the north. - 7-v
It is within one block of Point Lobos
avenue, the main driveway to the ocean
through the Richmond District, and also
within one block of the electric line that
runs along Thirty-third avenue on its way
to the City, thus insuring an easy method
I of transportation for pupils, instructors
and visitors.
It is understood that the trustees of the
Wilmerding bequest, while not knowing
I what the Mayor would do in the matter,
favored such a location, and it is believed
that should the school be built on this side
of the bay the site will be accepted.
As large and substantial buildings will
j be erected at a heavy outlay of money the
j school will be of much benefit to Rich-
I mond, and the residents and property
| owners in that district are enthusiastic
over the prospect of the school being lo
cated on block 315. The school will be
under the control of the regents of the
State University, and all has'e will be
made to erect the buildings when the site
question is settled.
Mayor Sutro said yesterday that he bad
selected the site after long and careful
consideration, and that in "his estimation
there was no more suitable location for.
such an institution on the San Francisco
peninsula. At first he had an idea of se
lecting a block south of the park, but the
residents of the north side were so earnest
in their desire to have the school buildings
located in Richmond that jbe acceded to
their requests and decided on a north-side
block. In case the site is accepted, build
ing will be beeun in a short time.
E. A. Denicke, chairman of the joint com
mittees appointed for the purpose of select
ing a site for the Wilmerding School, was
interviewed last night in relation to the
offer of Mayor Sutro.
"I received a communication from the
Mayor to-day," said he, "informing me
that he had presented: the Wilmerding
trust with a large block of land in Rich
mond district for a site. It is located in
block 315 on .Thirty-second avenue, be
tween A and B streets, on high groundâ a
very satisfactory place for the proposed
institution. The Sutro electric road to the
Cliff House is two blocks to the north and
Golden Gate Park two blocks to the south
ward of block 315. Point Lobos avenue,
the big thoroughfare of the district, leading
from the terminus of Geary street to the
ocean, passes near the place selected for the
site.
"I don't think a better locality could
have been found, as Richmond district is
coming to the front -as a choice residence
portion of the City.? I cannot now say just
what the trustees or executors of the
Wilmerding trust will do, but doubtless
they will hasten to accept the Mayor's
offer.
"A meeting will be held at the Hopkins
Art Institute next Tuesday to take action
in the matter."
AGAINST ANY REFUNDING
The American Railway Union
Exploits Anti-Railroad
Resolutions.
A Strong Demand That Congress Do
Not Pass the Billâ The Other
Trades Unions.
Since the late railroad strike the mem
bers of the American Railway Union in
this City and Oakland have been keeping
quiet, because they; saw that there was
nothing to be gained by making them
selves conspicuous. Many have thereby
been misled into believing that the de
feated union was crushed and dead. Such
is not the case, for according to the mem
bership rolls there are more A. R. U. men
than there were before. However, as
many of those who were barred from serv
ing the. railroad have found other posi
tions they do not attend every meeting, of
the unions.
Local Union No. 345 frequently holds
lively meetings, and those â¢ who have been
blacklisted ,by the railroad express them-'
selves freely upon all subjects pertaining
to the railroads in 'general and the Central
and Sou: hern .; Pacific in particular. 7 Such
a .meeting was . held last evening 'j when,
after a number of vigorous speeches upon
the funding-bill proposition, the following
outspoken resolutions were passed : ; 77
:â  Whereas, The j industrial and producing
classes of the State of California and the black
listed meinbersof the American Railway Union
are now engaged in a death struggle with a
gigantic, thieving, blood-sucking railroad mo
nopoly in order to break the chains they have
bouna us In for the last quarter of ; a century;
and whereas, the passage of a railroad funding
bill ;by Congress \ will but : more : than firmly
rivet the bonds upon an impoverished and al
most helpless people; therefore be it "â¢'* â¢â 'â¢.â '.
â¢ Resolved, That we, the members 'of i Local
Union > No. 345, f American ; Railway, Union, ; in
assemblage, . do 1 most i earnestly;: and *â â  unani
mously, protest against the passage of â¢ any
funding bill ;or any measure of ! similar char
acter which will' enable : the Central Pacific
Company to evade the settlement of its just
debts and; by so doing imposing upon the
people of California ;. the burden of the
payment, and that the â¢ present time Is 'in
all human probability the last opportunity
the people of the State of California will have
to free themselves from the bondage of this
thieving gigantic monopoly, which now threat
ens to take possession of the very Government
Itself and put us in poverty, as it has. our
blacklisted members, and make of us Its servile
vassals for all time, and r .. _ . ... ..
- Resolved. That the enormous and ill-gotten
gains realized from the construction and opera
tion of the railroad, which have been diverted
from their proper cnanneis into the pockets of
C. P. Huntington and his fellow-conspirators,"
together with the present assets of the com
pany, are vastly more than sufficient to cancel
the claim of the Government, we demand that
foreclosure be made upon them and not upon
the properties of the plundered and oppressed
people of tbis State.
Resolved, That we note with pride the honest
and manly stand taken by our Senators, Perkins
and White, and our esteemed Congressman,
Maguire, and also a majority of the Con
gressional delegation against this iniquitous
and infamous funding bill. â¢
Resolved, That to Mayor Sutro and the com
mittee of fifty of San Francisco, we are deeply
indebted for their determined opposition to
an insolvent.corrupt corporation ana its grovel

At the meeting of the District Council of
Carpenters and Joiners last evening, the
subject of carpentering in the Police De
par nient was discussed. It was reported
that in repairing the several stations regu
lar police officers are kept at work when
they should be patrolling their beats and
protecting lives and property from the
lawless. It was stated that from one to
half a dozen patrolmen are constantly
kept engaged doing work that journeymen
carpenters should have. It was consid
ered unfair that carpenters who are tax
payers should be deprived of the means of
making a living while this class of work is
being done by City officials who are sup
posed to be performing .another kind of
service. C- â ." ?->-.â¢;% â  â '?â '%- ------ - .'.-â¢.-, 7w' ;^.-,:*,,.
In order to learn who is; responsible for
this injustice a committee was appointed
to call upon" the Chief of Police, Police
Commissioners and the Supervisors. The
committee consists of John McCartney, L.
P. Norburg and L. JN. Vezina. The idea
prevailed that the supervisors, and not
the Police Commissioners, are responsible
in not providing the means for the pay
ment of a carpenter for the Police Depart
ment's carpenter work.
Several months ago a dozen men and
women employed in Schmidt's Label
Company at 17 Main street went on a
strike because of a reduction in the wages.
Their action was sustained by the Press
men's Union.
The executive committee of this body
last evening reported that Schmidt had
sent for them with a view of straightening
out the difficulty and declaring the strike
off. He insisted that several of the women
could not return to work. A second meet
ing was promised to fix up the matter and
the executive committee reported that
Schmidt had again changed his mind with
regard to compromising the difficulty.
The. union decided to continue the strike
arid agree to no terms but those they offer,
the re-establishment of. the old rate of
wages arid that all those on the strike be
taken back without prejudice.

LUMBER FOR THE SOUTH

F. H. Folsom's Story of the Heavy
Shipments to Los An

THE ENORMOUS SHINGLE TRArE
He Says -a Great Many Mills Have
Recently Started Up in the
Northern Forests.
T. II Folsom, a lumberman of Maine
and Minnesota, who not long ago located at
Everett, Wash., and who has been ship
ping large quantities of lumber and poles
for electric roads to Southern California, is
at the Grand.
Mr. Folsoin has forwarded three ship
loads of poles to San Pedro for use by Los
Angeles, Pasadena and Redlarids electric
lines and for electric lighting, and has a
contract for a large quantity in addition,
which will be sent down at an early date.
The poles are very heavy, being the best to
be obtained from the northern woods.
They are from thirty to fifty feet long..
"The building boom at Los Angeles has
been a godsend to the lumbermen of, the
north," said Mr. Folsom. "There have
been for some time an average of nine
ships unloading lumber in the harbor of
San Pedro, with all the lumber coming
from Puget Sound and Grays Harbor.
"By the building there a much better
market has been afforded Northwestern
lumbermen than formerly.,- Nearly all
the millsâ at least the big ones up in
Washington have been running for a year
past, but the demand, aside from that in
California, has been from I the East and
abroad. â¢
"There is now and has-been for. some
time past, however, a very stiff demand in

having the best of wood and enormous

"At the city of Everett, at the mouth of
the Snohomish River, Puget Sound, where
I live, there are about twenty-five shingle
mills running steadily, and over the Sound
in all directions are many other mills. I
suppose they average about 200,000 shin
gles each - a day. This will give you an
idea of the enormous quantity of the prod
uct.
"It has been extremely dull in Washing
ton for a year or two especially, and the
shingle and lumber business, as lately de
veloped, has given us - about the only
money we have had. I do not know
whether the lumber combine has yet been
effected or not, but most of the lumber
men think they ought to have a higher
price. . - -

about 5000* population, having, as will be

MUST PILL UP THE SLOTS
The Board of Health Warns the
Market-Street Railway
Company.
Davis CensoredâStartling Statements
Regarding the Actions of Past â¢
Officials.
The Board of Health gave the Market
street Railway Company warning yester
day that it must observe the regulations of
the board and fill up the slots in branch
roads that have been converted from cable
to electric lines.
Dr.' Morse started the discussion by
stating that he believed the unused slots
were a menace to the health of the public.
He said that as long as they were used
they were kept, clean, but that when
abandoned they were neglected and ac
cumulated all manner of 'filth and refuse,
that, by rotting, poisoned the air and bred
disease. ,He moved that the company be
instructed by the Health Officer to fill up
the objectionable cavities at once or that
the work would be done by the board at
the expense of the corporation. ;
The measure' was carried .unanimously,
and Superintendent Vining will be notified
to start the work at once.
Councils No. 3 and 48 of the American
Protective Association sent in communi
cations protesting against the proposed re
moval of Superintendent Weaver of the
Almshouse. These were placed on file.
When the charges against Market In
spector Davis were taken up E. C. Ham
mond, president of the Butchers' Board of
Trade, took the floor, and in a long speech
intimated that the trouble had arisen
more out of a faulty ordinance than any
criminal intent on the part of ,the|inspec
tor in passing immature veal.
He said that after killing it was almost
impossible to tell the age of calves. He
thought the ordinances relating to. the
matter should be amended to provide 'that
calves should be of a certain weightâ
five pounds or overâ before being per*
mitted to be sold.
Then Mr. Hammond made some state
ments that drew startled glances from the
members. '..
'In former administrations," said Ham
mond, "I have known calves condemned
by the meat inspector taken from one
man and s-old to another. 1 can quote In
stances where condemned meat has been
taken right out of the slaughter-houses
and sold. I should like to have embodied
in the ordinance the rule that the duties
of the Market Inspector shall be specifi
cally defined. There shall be a limit
placed upon their powers. For instance, I
myself , have had â  calves weighing eighty
founds condemned by the inspectors, and
think I know enough about -meat to
know that an eighty-pound calf is a pretty
healthy animal.
"I've called the attention of inspectors
to oversights myself, and they've come to
my place and condemned calves I've
pointed out to them. But the system has
been pretty lax, and I want the inspectors'
duties so construed as to be fair to us and
fair to the City." ._
A majority of the board was in favor of
finding that Davis had merely acted rashly
and hurriedly in passing the veal, ana by a
vote of 3 to 1 it was -decided to censure
Davis for that and nothing more.
Dr. Weil of the Receiving Hospital de
manded an investigation of certain charges
made agaiust .him by members of an or
ganization composed of ladies, but the
board decidi-d that the accusations had
been exploded and that the best way of
obviating the recurrence of such trouble
was to pass an order requiring those of an
investigating turn of mind to get permits
before beginning operations. The motion
was carried' unanimously," and in future
committees bent on such "errands will have
to get the signatures of the Mayor, and
members of the board before venturing
into institutions under the control of the
board. ..' â¢ . -â > -

REV. DR. BROWN
IS SUSTAINED
Sensational Prayer Meeting
Held at the First
Church.
BITTER WORDS BANDIED.
Mrs. Brown Ascends the Pulpit
and Attacks Mrs. Cooper,
Who Replies.
PASTOR ASKS FOR A COUNCIL.
Resolutions of Confidence Passedâ The
Doctor Not to Preach Until
Vindicated.
One of themost heated church meetings
known in this City took place last night at
the First Congregational Church. Bitter
' words were hurled by both friends and
opponents of the pastor who is resting
under a cloud of scandal. And his friends
proved the stronger. Out of the heat and
smoke of battle at length loomed at least
a partial victory for Dr. Brown.
The unusuaL spectacle of a minister's
wife appearing in the pulpit to plead the
cause of her husband was witnessed, for
probably the first time in religious history,
at the meeting ' which was the regular
weekly prayer meeting of the J'irst.
Church.
The situation was as unique as it was*
unexpected, and had a palpable influence
on the things that came after. It was a
daring thing to do, yet Mrs. Brown, the
wife of the man who stands accused of
grievous crimes against his own household
and public morality, executed the self
imposed task with a serenity and assur
ance which could only have been born of a
supreme conviction of the justness of her
cause.
When the usual prayers and hymns had
been rendered, Dr. Brown, who up to that
time had conducted the meeting, surren
dered the chair to Deacon Dexter. Before
that gentleman could define the principal
matters to be discussed, the pastor's wife
walked to the foot of the rostrum and
asked permission to speak. She was in
vited on the stage, and the people, not
knowing what to expect, craned their necks
and twisted their heads in an effort to get
a better view of her.
Once on the stage Mrs. Brown calmly
and deliberately unrolled several closely
written pages of manuscript, and in a
voice unshaken by emotion began to read
first a general review of the case and later
a terrible arraignment of Mrs. Sarah B.
Cooper. It was an intensely dramatic sit
uation. The words were cold, sharp and
cutting, yet at times there- breathed in
them gentleness and love for her husband,
and when she had finished the people
cheered loud and long. v- i
Mrs. Brown touched lightly on the main
issues, and then began her attack on Mrs.
Cooper, in the course of which she said:
"I lay the beginning of ail the trouble
that has come to me and my household to
Mrs. Cooper â dates back to the time
when she introduced Mis. Stockton to my
husband. - ' 7777;
Mrs. Cooper made a vigorous denial of
all this, and was loudly applauded at the
conclusion of her remarks. She said that
Mrs. Brown was wrong in her dates, and
further that this had not stated all the
conversation that took place at the time
referred to.
By 6:30 o'clock the people began to
gather in the assembly rooom. Half an
hour later every one of the 300 chairs was
occupied, and persons began to line up
against the wall. There was a noticeable
preponderance of women, many with chil
dren in their arms. Most of the congre
gation wore a serious, troubled look, as if
the seriousness of the situation, with its
possible evil results, bore heavily upon
them. Outside, near the big iron gate,
two policemen were stationed, but at
whose request no one seemed to know.
At 7:20 Mrs. Brown walked leisurely in,
followed ten minutes later by her hus
band. With firm, confident tread he
ascended the stage, and, without any pre
liminary remarks, opened the meeting by
announcing hymn 223, "Nearer, My God,
to Thee." While the prelude to the hymn
was being played several of his most ar
dent lady admirers walked .hastily up to
the desk and deposited handsome bouquets
of roses, violets and pinks.
Dr. Brown then read that passage of the
Scriptures which begins with "The Lord
is my shepherd." and! at the conclusion
said he had no comment to make.
Then more . hymns were sung and
prayers were uttered, the prayer meeting
proper coming, to a close -at exactly 8
o'clock. Then Dr. Brown fired a little
bombshell in the ranks of those who were
present out of sheer > curiosity. He said
that some important business was to come
up for consideration, and he would
ask those not members of the church, ex
cepting newspaper men, to kindly retire.
When the room was finally cleared Dea
con Dexter was called to the chair, and
then followed the dramatic episode be
tween Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Cooper.
The chairman announced at the begin
ning that no boisterous conduct would be
permitted, and to his credit be it said that
he faithfully maintained that programme.
Once or twice confusion seemed about to
assume control, but Deacon Dexter was
always equal to the occasion.
Only once during the evening did the
pastor lose his self-control. Dr. Warren
made some caustic remark about the vote
of confidence, when Dr. Brown sprang
from his chair, and pointing . his finger at
the venerable missionary said in a voice
full of emotion:
- ".You had better keep still. I do not
care to talk to you here, but I could tell
some things if I wanted."
Resolutions and counter resolutions were
the order of the evening, Dr. Brown's
forces coming off victorious in every in
stance. The resolution of the joint com
mittee, that of Deacon Barnard, and a
third by Attorney Nagle, went through by
nearly a two to one vote. 'Of course there
was much bitterness and ill feeling : mani
fested, but it was not all directed 5 toward
Dr. Brown, but largely to the people de
fending him.
When the smoke of the two hours' bat
tle had cleared away Dr. Brown's, friends
were wild with joy. They crowded around
the pastor,' grasped his hand and mingled
their tears with his. For twenty minutes
or more this was kept up, and was only
ended then by the pastor, declaring him
self utterly worn out.
During the handshaking Mrs. Cooper
came up to Dr. Brown, and in a voice
trembling with emotion said: "I have
been grossly insulted by one of j your fol
lowers. A woman, Mrs. Szanik, called my
daughter a pock-marked, meddlesome
creature. That shows the kind of people
who voted confidence in you to-night."
Dr. Brown assured Mrs. Cooper of his
regret at the unpleasant occurrence and
there the matter ended.
The pastor of the First Congregational
Church will not occupy the pulpit again
until he has cleared himself of the charges
resting against him. He stated this at the
meeting last night, and to support it asked
for an immediate . investigation by the
council. ; 77U -'7--. 7
THE MEETING.
Details of the Business Transacted
at the Exciting Church
Gathering-.
Deacon D. Gilbert Dexter was called
to preside by Dr. Brown immediately the
somewhat curtailed prayer-meeting exer
cises were at an end, but not before Dr.
Brown, on the request of the officers of the
church, had asked all present who were
not members of the church and pew
holders to retire, so that there might not
be any interference with the proper and
accurate taking of the vote and the tran
saction of other business. Most - of the
visitors then retired to the hallways and
ante-rooms, while some went home.
Scarcely had the chairman assumed his
place when Mrs. Brown, the wife of the
pastor, came down the middle aisle, where
she had been seated, and walking to the
edge of the platform and facing the pre
siding officer, said:
"I wish to address a few words to the
people present before the business proper
begins. '
Chairman Dexter then announced, "Mrs.
Brown will address you for a few min
utes." While Mrs. Brown was walking
around to the back of the platform . to
ascend it Deacon Dexter continued :
I trust, friends, that we are all here to-night
with the full intention of not only doing our
duty in every respect, but to respect the word
of Godâ that we respect ourselves in whatever
we do. I trust there will be nothing of the
hissing character in this room. Nothing
grieves me more than that exhibition of last
Wednesday night. I hope there will be no
more of it, no matter who may be speaking or
what the question may be. I would also Tike
you to suppress applause. This is a business
meeting ot serious importance ; of great impor
tance to the church, of very great importance
to every one here, of greater importance than
you realize now.
Let us in all our acts "to-night feel right In
what we do.
Then referring to Mrs. Brown, who was
ready to read her remarks, he said: "This
is a question of privilege before you."
Mrs. Brown then read as follows:
Ladies and Gentlemen and my Friends of the
First Church: What I am about to utter here
is said wholly of my own suggestion.
I feel it my duty to be silent no longer, as
the good name of my husband is called in
question. I have a right to speak, not only in
his behalf, but as a wife and mother, in de
fense of my homo, which Mrs. Cooper, setting
herself up as judge, and jury, has attacked.
The dearest spot on earth has been assailedâ
my homeâ and by one whom I had, until
within a very short time, supposed was a
friend. I wish to call Mrs. Cooper's attention
to the fact that she was the one who intro
duced Mrs. Stockton to my husband one Sun
day after the morning service.
she commended Mrs. Stockton to him as a
former teacher of one of her kindergartens.
It was then said that she was thinking of
uniting with our church, which she afterward
did. To whom could comparative strangers
look for safe guidance in the forming of ac
quaintances if not to one of Mrs. Cooper's
standing in the church and society? She is a
prominent Bible-class teacher and"one of the
pastor's assistants. â KMmjHHKBB
This was Dr. Brown's first meeting with Mrs.
Stockton. About eight months later, just after
the incident at Mrs. French's home, at the
Monday Ministers' Club, which was held at
that time in the Y. M. C. A. building on Sutter
street, Mrs. Cooper came to Dr. Brown and my
self, requesting us to remain after the others
had cone, as she had a matter of great import
j ance to talk with us about alone.
We were there with Mrs. Cooper from half to
three-quarters of an hour.
Mrs. Cooper said : "I must talk with you, my
dear Dr. and Mrs. Brown, about Mrs. Stockton.
The matter is troubling me. I want to warn
you both against her. She is a bad woman and
there is a good deal of talk about her. I kept
her in the kindergarten just as long as I
i dared."
She also told us of Mrs. Stockton's going to
Port Angeles and now Mrs. S.s name was
"blown about" in that city.
Mrs. Cooper also gave details of scandalous
matter of the most damaging character said to
have occurred in this City, in which she
affirmed Mrs. Stockton was one of the princi
pals and gave the name of a man, which 1
withhold.
Mrs. Cooper said she had known these facts
ever since Mrs. Stockton's return from the
north, and excused her introduction of Mrs.
Stockton to my husband on the ground of "for
mality," and also stated that she knew these
facts at the time of the introduction and ad
mission into the church.
More than a year and a half has passed since
this talk in the old Y. M. C. A. building on Sut
ter street between Mrs. Cooper, Dr. Brown and
myself.
And now, within the last few weeks, Mrs.
Cooper speaks in the daily press of | Mrs. Stock
ton, highly commending her. lam surprised
at Mrs. Cooper beyond expression.
You, Mrs. Cooper, at one time warned us
against - Mrs. Stockton, and <â  we instantly
heeded your warning. This was your
charge against Mrs. Stockton, and not
mine. Now you commend her to the public as
a good woman. God will judge you. At your
door, Mrs. Cooper, I lay the beginning of mv
sorrow and that of my family, for you intro
duced Mrs. Stockton to my Husband and to
the church, and gave opportunity for the evils
of slander which now effect mv husband.
Mrs. Cooper's attack on my home, therefore,
is not -.rithout reason. She is acting before
hand in self-defense. When this storm broke
she saw that it would surely involve her own
good name, and she is trying to kill my hus
band before he can speak in his own defense,
and this she is doing in the hope that a "dead
man will tell no tales." But lam here to say
to her that no charge made against him or my
home is so serious as that which I now present
against her, and in this matter she must
reckon, not with Dr. Brown, but with me. Dr.
Brown refused Mrs. Stockton a letter, but Mrs.
Cooper publishes her commendation to the
world. .
At the time of Mrs. Cooper's confession to us,
she had long known these fact. She pledged
us to secrecy on the ground that her own good
name was involved, but her conduct in at
tacking us and renewing her commendation of
Mrs. Stockton removes the ban, and I shall be
no longer bound even If I must speak alone.
To those of you who are trying to injure the
good name of my husband, which has stood
above reproach in the ministry for nearly a
quarter of a century, and whoso character has
never been in question before:. who would at
this time tear in [pieces his reputation, our
home, and all that makes life worth living, to
you, 1 say, beware !
There is One above who will judge you, and
due time you wili have your reward. -It is
said in one of the papers, as coming from Mrs.
Cooper, that Dr. Brown introduced Miss Over
man to her, in the presence of his wife, as his
niece. This is false. He never introduced
Miss Overman to any one as his niece.
1 want to say further that ; Miss Overman i
came to our home on a visit, spending a few
months with us at my invitation, and I want it
distinctly understood she is now under our
roof by my invitation and not that of my hus
band. Her testimony is, of course, absolutely
essential, and although Miss Overman was
ready to depart, for her home weeks ago she
consented to stay until the council and possi
bly the court has heard her testimony.
In closing this first public address of my life
I appeal to many in this church who were
merciful; in J their* judgment of Dr. Barrows to
at least wait till my husband can be heard. I
appeal to the whole church not to help Mrs.
Cooper persecute my husband and destroy my
home. Mrs; Cooper iat one time thought her
self persecuted, and the whole country heard
her outcries.. Doubtless some one said then, as
she says now, "That the church is to be consid
ered before any. individual." but the maxim
did not relieve her sufferings. v
It is but little to ask that Dr. Brown's hith
erto spotless reputation be permitted to stand
in confidence a few weeks, especially when the
abhorrent character . of those who accuse him
is considered. ' Mes.C. O. Brown.
At the conclusion of the reading Miss
Cooper, the daughter of Mrs. â¢ Sarah B.
Cooper, who is not a member of the church,
asked that the last sentence be read again.
- Objection was made by, a member to
â  Miss Cooper taking part in the proceed
ings, and then the same request was made
by Mrs. Cooper,. but Mrs. Brown refused
to comply. : . .-.-.'â ''. ""â â "' :'- :
[ Then a lady member of the church arose
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1896.
Dr. Brown's Wife Reading Her Statement in Defense of Her Husband and Home.
[Sketched by a "Call " artist.]
and in tones of evident emotion spoke as
follows:
Mrs. Brown, as a member of this church
nearly as long as the pastor has occupied the
pulpit, I want to thank you for your courage
in making this statement. lama wife and a
mother and I heartily sympathize with you.
I demand that Dr. Brown occupy his pulpit
Here Mrs. Cooper secured recognition
and began by saying: "1, also, rise to a
question of privilege." [Applause.]
This brought John F. Merrill to his feet,
saying: "The house of God is no place for
applause."
Chairman Dexterâ hope you will all keep
quiet through the whole proceedings of the
evening. We want only what is right.
Mrs. Cooper â Mr. Chairman, friends and mem
bers of the church: I, of course, was not aware
that there would be anything of this kind to
night. Had I known it I should have been en
tirely ready to make a full and complete re
sponse. To do that I need to consult mv own
diary at home, which gives facts and "dates.
It makes a very great difference in respect to
dates.
My friend, Mrs. Brownâ hope she is still a
friendâ got her dates very much confused.
I fortunately keep an account of every such
transaction.
In reference to Mrs. Stockton I will say that
in 1890 she was one of our very best kinder
gartners. She was trained by Mrs. Kate Wig
gins for kindergarten work and was sent to
the Willard Free Kindergarten. We never had
a more affectionate and better teacher of little
children. She was proverbial for that among
all the teachers. She gave up her work in
about a year. She was with us only during the
time of her training.
A friend of Mrs. Stockton asked me to place
her, if I could, in another school. We did not
have another kindergarten here in which to
place Mrs. Stockton, but there was an applica
tion for a kindergarten from Port Angeles,
Wash., and we sent her there. We had reports
from her there that she was doing excellent
work, and that she was beautifully adapted
for it. .
As far as my memory serves me, she returned
to this City after being there one year.
I had three letters from Port Angeles, which
I now hold, in regard to Mrs. Stockton, and
those letters simply state that it would not be
well for me to. highly recommend her as a
teacher of little children, as she did not, like
many others ot us, always pay her bills or
make arrangements to pay them, and in the
letters were inclosed some of her unpaid bills.
This is the history of Mrs. Stockton. And
whatever she has done since that timeâ five
years agoâ as she herself stated, I have known
nothing personally.
At the time of the little trial in connection
with the Turkish tea I was told about it, and I
think Mrs. French will bear testimony that I
said nothing whatever about her.
I heard she would make application for mem
bership in the church, and in speaking of it
my daughter and I both remarked we were
glad to see that she was going to change her
course of life.
in regard to the interview with the pastor at
the time she speaks Â«f Mrs. Brown is very true,
but not at all in regard to the time. It was at
the time of Mrs,. Stockton's return from Port
Angeles. She has not the dates correctly.
What occurred was this: I saw Dr. and Mrs.
Brown coing upon a streetcar, and I said to
Dr. Brown he had better make inquiry, but a
statement of a broad and unpleasant nature
was never made in any way. I spoke to our
pastor as I feel we always should speak to our
pastor. My misfortune was that his wife was
with him. It is our duty and privilege to sug
gest to our pastor, and I have never heard
irom either Dr. Brown or Mrs. Brown that I
did anything unchristian on that occasion. If
I did they should have told me at that time.
That is all I can say about that matter until
I can consult my diary. I am satisfied Mrs.
Brown is very much mixed in her dates.
Dr. Brown then arose from his seat near
the piano, near the rear of the platform,
came forward and spoke as follows :
This whole incident was contrary to mv
advice. I am, however, not one of those who
are disposed to say to their wives what they
shall or shall ' not do.' I am bound to say it is
her right to speak in behalf of her home. She
is strictly right In her defense and in her
statements concerning Mrs. Cooper and Mrs.
Stockton. * .v*7 â¢â â¢-â¢â¢â¢â 
On the motion of Dr. Brown Deacon
Barnard was elected secretary.
The first business was the consideration
of the report of the joint committee, read
ing as follows:
The committee having canvassed the whole
subject have come to the unanimous conclu
sion that it is unwise to enter upon any ex
tended investigation as expressed in the fol
lowing statement: .
This joint committee, consisting of the
standing committee of the First Congrega
tional Church and a special committee of the
Bay Association of Congregational .Ministers,
submits to the public the following statement
bearing on the case of the Rev. C. O. Brown,
D.D., against whom serious charges are current
in the community.
The committee of the association desires to
be understood that it is not \ intrusted with
any authority under the usages or according
to the ; principles of the < Congregational
churches to either convict or acquit or even
to investigate. This is the function of the
local church, assisted at its own request by an
ecclesiastical council.
The standing committee of the church,
while recognizing that it isjits duty to take the
initiative in â this as - in all matters of church
discipline, yet asks the attention and the can
did consideration of the public the the follow
ing facts, and the committee of the association
indorses most earnestly this request. .. "
â  Eirstâ That there are possible contingencies
in the processes of the -? Superior . Court, in
which our brother will be arraigned, as well
as the defendant, in view of which he is for
bidden by. the evident i necessities of the case
and by the imperative interdicts of his coun
sel,; from making public J. those \ statements
which he confidently believes would remove
the suspicions now existing, aud that we deem
it inadvisable for him to make any statements
, to us Âp rivately which he â¢is not allowed to
make publicly. /;. â¢â¢:.:: : v â -."â -â  , ..;
''â  * Secondâ That 'â â  we â  have : found our . brother
eager to welcome, and impatient to insist upon,
the most : thorough I investigation of his con
duct. And â¢as soon as the impediments now
existing are removed by the conclusions of the
legal trial he has assured us he will ask the
church to institute this investigation, assisted
by an ecclesiastical council duly convened;
and, .-.-.' .
Thirdâ in view of these things we pro
pose for ourselves and we ask of ' all others a
suspension of judgment in the case ot Dr.
Brown, and we hereby express our confidence
in his integrity.
At the request of Dr. Brown the second
resolution was read again by the secretary.
S. C. Simpson then asked permission to
present a substitute for this report. After
some technical objections the chairman
declared a substitute was in order, and
Mr. Simpson then came to the platform
and read the following preamble and reso
lutions: v
I move to amend the pending preamble
and resolution, so that the same shall read
as follows:
Whereas, Certain charges of immoral con
duct nave been made against our pastor, Rev.
C. O. Brown, D.D., by a person now in prison
awaiting trial for a detestable crime, and grave
and direct intimations of a like character are
contained in ; certain letters, recently pub
lished, purporting to have been written by a
person who ; - is- at' present a member of for.
Brown's; household; and whereas, these accu
sations have been disseminated by the public
prints, and though unsupported by proof have
worked and are working incalculable injury
to the good name of our pastor and of this
i church, and to the cause of Christianity, now
therefore be it :> Â:-:
Resolved, By the members of the First Con
gregational Church of San Francisco, duly as
sembled, that, with- the concurrence of our
pastor, which is respectfully solicited, we
hereby rail an ecclesiastical council to be con
vened forthwith, or as soon as practicable in
accordance with Congregational usages, for the
investigation of the accusations above men
tioned.
Resolved, Further, that in such investigation
we will loyally and cordially assist our pastor
by every proper means in our power in bring
ing the truth to light, to the end that his good
name and that of our church may be trium
phantly vindicated, and that in the meantime
we respectfully ask the public to suspend
judgment upon the matter, and to accord to
Dr. Brown the presumption of innocence which
the rules of law and the principles of natural
justice and common fairness grant to every
accused person until the contrary is clearly
established.
Dr. Brown then: thanked Mr. Simpson
for the kindly tenor of the resolutions, and
said that he would be satisfied to have
them adopted as : a substitute. He then
continued:
But I claim the privilege of asking a ques
tion of those whose minds have been influ
enced by what has been - published in the
newspapers during the past thirty-nine days.
Had 1 been in your place and you in mine I
doubt whether I should have kept myself free
from the same prejudices that affect you. Ido
not. blame you for your position. I look for
ward with the greatest confidence to the time
when you will come forward and shake me
by the hand and say you are certain of my in
nocence.
There are some men â¢in this audience who
have seen my defense.; Those men have no
previous prejudice for me and would rather
stand against me. -'Jfflnf^OTfÃliilf^illiMlilliJM^ffpfiitÃ
I now claim the right to ask the question
which I spoke of.
He then spoke of the great service he
was doing the community in prosecuting
Mrs. Davidson as a blackmailer. He stated
that he had been cautioned against this
course by his attorney, who had graphic
ally pictured to him all he would have to
endure, and added that he had not been
deterred from his course. '
Continuing he added:
Within the past forty-eight hours facts have
been placed within my possession which make
me feel that I should have been tbe mover of a
motion' to look into these things. I now move
the adoption of the substitute. I want to as
sure you that my absolute vindication could
be brought about by speaking twenty sen
tences, but I cannot do so now.. . :.
It will all be told when the witnesses will all
be here. :-â -, : â¢â¢ "^
I believe that, there is no plot in all Victor
Hugo that for a moment compares with the in
tricate and. diabolical plot that woman has
woven for my destruction.' It has been very
hard to restrain myself from telling you what I
knew, but lam now ready to do so. â¢â 'â â  Â» . -.
.-i Considerable discussion ensued on par
liamentary grounds â¢as to the substitute
being considered under existing circum
stances.
â¢": An appeal was finally taken from the
ruling of the chair, that the substitute was
a proper one under the circumstances, and
his decision was reversed.
Mr. Simpson explained that the reason
for his having offered the resolution was
that he believed a council should be called
at once and added that if Dr. Brown meant
to call a council immediately there; would
be no need for adopting the resolutions. 7,
# Dr. Brown stated that it ) was his inten
tion to call the council at' once.' : ;
7 During; the debate on the report of the
joint committee, which was now the busi
ness before the meeting, Dr. Brown stated
that he regretted very much the hissing of
last ; Wednesday, and that he intended to
protest against it, but that the chairman
ad anticipated him. "My son," he said,
"says he cannot remember that he took
part in that "demonstration". 7 If I knew he
did I should certainly take him .to' task
for it." .;.:-'.-â¢ â â :,â â¢â â "â -â â  7 : .;:.-7;X-iVv>
Mrs. Cooper here arose and disavowed
any ill-feeling toward Master Brown, and
spoke as follows :
In the few words that I have to say I shall
dwell upon principles and not upon persons.
The ; first are eternal, the last are but i transi
tory. It is a firm and â¢ unfaltering adherence
to principle r that, in the long- run, assures , to
us the smile of God and the confidence of man
kind. The resolution of the -joint, committee
as published reads, in part, thus: * *, * "We
propose for ourselves, and we' ask of all others, '
a suspension of judgment in the case of Dr.
Brown, and we hereby express our confidence
in his integrity." â 
To the logical mind this resolution is very
incongruous. It is contradictory in its very
nature. It is a decided error in logic to aÂ«sume
that a suspension of judgment will allow of
either acquittal or conviction of the accused.
Therefore the statement of "confidence in his
integrity" is contrary to the same and is a
paraaoxical absurdity.
The first clause in regard to "a suspension of
judgment" is right and just, but, in the next
breath, to ask for an expression of "confidence
in his integrity is to ask for an immediate ex
pression of judgment nolens volens. This
expression some of us may not be prepared to
give until all the evidence in the case has been
duly weighed and examined. Truth cannot
be established by resolutions. Resolutions
cannot change facts, and genuine character
has nothing to fear from facts. And we must
nver forget that the vigor and health of mind
and soul will forever depend upon our rever
ent regard for and our assimilation of facts. I
suppose we are all anxious to conserve the best
and highest interests. of the church and of
Christianity.' We certainly should be. We
solemnly covenant, when we unite with the
church, to seek its peace and prosperity. The
only way to seek and to preserve the peace and
prosperity of the church is to seek and to pre
serve the purity of the church. First pure,
then peaceable, is the divine order. Truth,
purity and righteousness are the immutable
laws of social order whether in church or
state. As says the grand old prophet, Isaiah:
"The work of righteousness shall be peace;
and the effect of righteousness shall be quiet
ness and assurance forever. And my people
shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in
sure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places."
And so, my friends, I see but one thing to do,
in the midst of any perplexity* and sorrow,
whatsoever. It is to do as David did, when he
was in very great distress and peril. He tells
us plainly what we ought to do: "Offer the
sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust
in the Lord." Continue in the way of duty;
go to the .sanctuary even when you have to
grope for the sacred door in darkness of spirit ;
seek the altar and say concerning the God of
truth and of righteousness: He will make the
truth manifest in His own good time and way.
- In view, therefore, of the fact that the evi
dence is not all in as yet on either side, I move,
as an amendment, that the last clause of the
resolution be eliminated, and that this last
clause be laid upon the table until such time
as any and all doubts may be removed. When
that time comes, I shall beg to be permitted to
offer the resolution myse it, thinking it might
have somewhat more emphasis as coming from
one who now earnestly asks lor its suspension.
The resolution asks for a suspension of judg
ment, which, by parity of reasoning, necessarily
includes a suspension also of the vote of confi
dence. .-â ;. " â â . â¢ â â  , -
When she concluded Dr. Brown spoke as
follows: â.'â¢â '
Ido not think we want to spend our time
in listening to long speeches or quotations
from the Scriptures. .1 want to say that no
friend of mine will vote for what Mrs. Cooper
has proposed to-night. ,
.Charles G. ; Nagle stated that every one
present had the highest regard .arid re
spect for Dr. Brown, both as a minister
and as a man. %
Another debate was precipitated, in the
course of which Mr. Wolcott indulged in
a tirade including the expression "miser
able, dirty whelps," for which he was
angrily taken to task by the chairman.
On a standing vote being taken the chair
man announced that Mrs. Coopers motion
was lost, , but. Dr. Brown, desirous, as he
stated, of ascertaining how many friends
he had in the church, asked that the vote
be counted. ; This showed >60 for a nd 123
against the proposed amendment.
The report of the , joint ' committee as a
whole then came up for adoption. After
all debate had been ruled out of order, just
before the count was made for the affirma
tive side, Dr. Brown remarked: "I want
to say that every friend of mine votes for
this resolution."
; Dr. Warren, who had attempted to' speak
and who was debarred by the chairman,
addressed the latter as follows: "Did you
object to Dr. Brown appealing to his
friends?"
To this Dr. Brown quickly responded as
follows: "You had better keep still, I tell
you that. I will give you my reasons pri
vately." V
The vote on this' showed 125 for and 70
against the adoption of the resolution,
which was declared carried.
Â Deacon Vasconcellos then moved , the
adoption of the report of ,the trustees and
standing committee of the church, which
reads as follows:
Whereas, Certain intimations of immoral
conduct have been made against C. O. Brown,
D.D., by irresponsible persons and without any
proof as to their credibility, now be it --*â¢'.- â :â -.-â 'â '
Resolved, That this > body expresses full and
entire confidence in Rev. C. O. Brown's integ
rity and good moral character and will not
credit vague and damaging insinuations until
they are proved before a competent tribunal. .
This â  was â¢ also adopted by ' a large ma
jority. Attorney then made a mo
tion in effect that the â  pastor occupy his
pulpit until "the investigation was com
pleted. This brought forth a vigorous
protest from the minority, Mr. Holbrook
acting ;as chief I spokesman. Dr. Brown
urged his friends to stand by him and not
let it go out to the world' that he could
not occupy his pulpit until this affair was
ended. Chairman Dexter then put the
motion of Mr. - Nagle .: and â  by a standing
vote it was passed, 114 to 75.
â¢ # --; Dr. Brown then said with evident feel
ing: "I f- shall j never occupy the pulpit
again until I am cleared jof these charges.
Now I make a motion that a committee be
appointed to make the preliminary ar
rangements for the meeting of the coun
| Cih";.:7'\;y7 ; '-'' ; ' /.;.. ;-;.. :'â '... Â'â¢ v-;' -V 'â '"â i :*7
' It was suggested that Dr. Brown reduce
this to a resolution, which was. done, the
deacons being named as the committee.
The meeting then adjourned.
The deacons will hold a meeting to-day,
when they expect to set the machinery in
motion that will bring the council" to

Living Picture of C. P. Hunting
ton on the Witness-Stand
Twenty Years Ago.
COHEN'S SCATHING INVECTIVE.
The Magnate's Lapses of Memory.
"Brand of Perjury Indelibly Im
pressed Upon His Forehead."
At a time when Southern Pacific meth
ods and practices, in and out of State and
National politics, and in private financial
matters, are being widely discussed, and
when public' suspicion, to put it mildly, is
directed to the attempts of Mr. Hunting
ton and his satellites to foist upon the peo
ple a measure that reeks with injustice to
the whole country, and especially to the
people of California ; when this same Mr.
Huntington is being paraded by his paid
supporters as a man who is being
wronged by a cruel press, and who is
suffering from unjust attacks upon
his reputation for honesty and ve
racity; at a time when such a roan, with
the air of injured innocence, is masquerad
ing as a patient, much abused person from
whom the people have withheld praises
due ana of whom the people now dare to
demand some tithe of what belongs to
them â such a time it will not be unin
teresting to|readers in general to behold
the picture that is revealed when the light
is turned upon the past career of C. P.
Huntington, that past career which he
would give millions to have erased from
the records and buried in oblivion.
Few men were in a better position to
thoroughly , know Huntington than the
late Alfred A. Cohen. He had been in the
employ of the railroad company and had
large dealings with it. but finally he had
won the hatred of members of that corpo
ration and they struck at him a blow that
was intended to shatter his influence and
standing. The stroKe had a boomerang
effect.
Cohen in 1868 owned a ferry system be
tween this City and Oakland and Alameda,
and he sold it to the directors of the Cen
tral Pacific Railroad in 1869. Alter that,
Cohen managed the property for the pur
chasers until August, 1870, when it was
consolidated with the Central Pacific Rail
road Company. Then Cohen became
agent and attorney for the company, at an
annual salary, with the proviso that the
duties should not interfeie with his private
business. This arrangement continued
until 1875, when Cohen withdrew from the
railroad company's service.
Now, in the year 1863 Cohen and others
purchased part of a ferry-slip at the foot
of Second street, known as block 9, from
Henry B. Tichenor, the latter retaining
one-fourth interest. The purchase price
was $200,000. In October. 1869, Hunting
ton, as represented by the Contract and
Finance Company, obtained an option
from Tichenor to purchase block 9 within
a year for $250,000. The option was exer
cised and the property purchased for that
price. Years passed ; a social quarrel
sprang up between Cohen and one -of the
members of the corporation in 1876.
â  Cohen left -the company's employ and
advocated a bill before the Legislature for
the regulation of freights and fares on the
company's line, whereupon the corpora
tion, to destroy Cohen's influence, raked
up a tiansaction seven years old and
brought suit against Cohen, alleging that
the latter in 1869, acting as the company's
agent, had purchased block 9 for $200,000,
and by secret arrangement with Tichenor,
had reported the price to the company at
$250,000, the defendant (Cohen) fraudu
lently retaining $50,000.
For this latter sum the railroad company
sued Cohen. The action is entitled Cen
tral Pacific Railroad Company vs. Alfred
A. Cohen, and it was tried in the Twelfth
District Court of San Francisco in October,
1876.
The case served to show up the members
of the corporation. It was heard before
Judge W. P. Daingerfield, who, having
heard all the evidence and listened to the
able arguments of - both sides, without
taking the case under ' advisement, imme
diately announced his findings in favor of
Cohen, the defendant.
In that case, Huntington was a leading
witness for the plaintiff. His character is
painted on the records of that court.
Mr. Cohen fully comprehended the in
iquitous power of the corporation which
has become the great Southern Pacific
Railroad Company of to-day. In begin
ning his remarkable address" in that case
he averred :
I know that the power of this great corpora
tion, which has been not inaptly compared to
that of the devil-fish, has been extended in al
most every direction. I know that the clank of
its golden fetters has been heard along the
floors of legislative halls. I know that the
mildew of its conupting influence has crept
over the desk of Supervisors and Assessors. I
know that its gilded finger of menace has been
raised to make dumb voices that should have
been heard on the side of the people in caucus
and in convention.
In discussing the evidence given in the
suit in question by the man who is now
the controlling power in the Southern
Pacific, Mr. Cohen says:
Mr. Huntington is the urbane" member of
the corporation. He is theEpbraim Smooth,
the Congressional operator, the legislative
broker and financial manipulator of this great
corporate Kraken. Mr. Huntington is the
diner and winer of the Washington depart
ment of this devil-fish.
Mr. Huntington possesses a memory like one
of the rocking stones of the ancient Druidsâ
the finger of a friend placed on the right spot
can cause it to vibrate to the very center, but
the battering-ram of a foe cannot move it one
iota from its stolidity. Before a Congressional
committee and in the witness-box, or in the
taking of a deposition, Mr. Huntington is the
representative know-nothing of the nine
teenth century; he is a very centennial speci
men. Mr. Huntington obtained his vast wealth
from the Contract and Finance Companyâ of
that pulseless, viewless, conscienceless, im
palpable but affluent incorporeal monster Mr.
Huntington was a part to the extent of one
fourth.
The Contract and Finance Company, com
posed of Stanford, Huntington, Hopkins and
the Crackers, was in partnership with the
Central, and Western Pacific Railroad Com
pany, composed , of the Crackers, Huntington,
Hopkins and Stanford. It was a partnership
which resulted in the first corporation owning
all the property and the second corporation
owing all the debts. The railroad corpora
tion proper, the debt-saddled and enrse-in
cumbered. corporation, still lives. It lives to
elude assessors, to debauch legislatures, and to
cower at the doors of Congress, sacking only
immunity and oblivion. Once its cry was that
of the daughters of- the horse- leech, . "Give!
Give!" Now its refrain is, "Let us alone! : Let
us alone 1"
On September 10, 1875, in San Francisco,
the members of the Contract and Finance
Company /voted to , put an end to its life,
and Mr. Huntington voted one-fourth of
the whole capital stock of the company in
favor of , disincorporation. Mr. Cohen,
therefore, makes the supposition that the
Contract' and Finance -Committee is no
more, and he continued from this point as
follows: , .
; â¢ But the curious circumstance to which I call
your Honor's I attention here is that the afflu
ent legatee, the bereaved orphan, the quad
rilateral executioner of the Contract and Fi
, nance Company, the man who -â  stood by both
its cradle and its tomb, the witness, Hunting
ton, was, only four months after its demise, un
able 7 'to .â â â  recollect that it had -ever -lived,
for on the' > 19th of January, . 1876,
Mr. Huntington: swore before a com
mittee of the House of Representatives at
Washington that he did not know, the names
of any of the officers or directors of the Con
tract and Finance Company ; that he scarcely
recollected its existence, and only knew that
it had gone onto! existence because Judge
Brown had 6 told him .so Wig. if that poor,
digraced. forgotten entity had been living ana
breathing it might have said with Lear .
How sharper than ft serpent's tooth it is
To have a thankless child.
And yet the witness Huntington, who cries,
Non mi ricordo! non mi^ordorabout .im
portant event occurring four months oeiore, is
able to recollect with precision an
tial detail of a business transaction seven years
old - . , â
But the most burning invective of all
that scathing address was when Mr. Cohen
summed up and analyzed the testimony of
C. P. Huntington. Listen to his arraign
ment of the railroad magnate:
I have alluded to the nature of the memory
of Huntington, and 1 ask your Honor's consid
eration one minute to the character of his
cross-examination. Now, sir, I appeal to you
boldly and with confidence, whether you, sit
ting here Impartially to judge between the
plaintiff and myself, holding the scales of
justice with an even and Arm hand, neither in
clining to or.c side nor the other, whether from
what you saw of that witness on the stand, you
would allow his testimony, to affect the balance
either way. > â¢ '
I do not like to comment with any harshness
upon the testimony of Huntington, because
utter his examination and just at the adjourn
ment of the court he toid me If this thing con
tinuedâif he was cross-examined any more â
there would be a coolness between us. Ido
not wish to produce that deplorable result; but
1 do say that if. in the course of my limited ex
perience, I ever saw justice not only tempered
but diluted with mercy it was when your
Honor allowed him to leave the courtroom a
free man, instead of sending him in charge of
an officer to be examined by a magistrate upon
a charge of perjury.
I say that one of the most disgraceful inci
dents oi this whole trial was this one man's
evidence the vice-president of this great cor
porationâthe man who has been foremost In
administering the great trust which the Na
tion condded to himself and his associates â
coming here and, to question after question,
swearing that he did not recollect facts which
it was impossible, in the nature of things, that
he ever could forget; and then, when he is
pressed, when the questions are coming thick
and close upon him. and they are getting to be
decidedly inconvenient, what does he do? .
He turns around and replies by impertinent
and flippant personal remarks. So we have
it from very high authority that no less a per
son than Mr. (afterward Lord) Brougham, who
was counsel in the celebrated trial of Queen
Caroline, and he makes the remark about a
witness whose want of recollection has become
a matter of history, and who has immortalized
and perpetuated a term which he used so
many times in the course of the testimony in
that case; "Non mi ricordo I" that "nothing
more surely discloses the testimony of a false
witness than flippancy and impertinence in
the manner of telling his story."
"A false witness is always flippant and im
pertinent when he is pressed." And that is
just what Mr. Huntington way. I say that in
this case, where more than money is involved;
where you, sir, sitting as chancellor, are asked
to determine whether the plaintiff in this case
is entitled to a decree upon the ground of
fraud; no reliance, not one particle, should be
placed upon the testimony of such a witness as
that man Huntington. I do not like to say
anything that is harsh. Ido not like to go be
yond the bounds of decent and respectable lan
guage. I do not like to call men by opprobrious
epithets, but I do say this, and hold myself re
sponsible for it at all times and In all places,
that if ever a witness left the stand with the
brand of perjury indelibly impressed upon his
forehead, that witness was C. I*. Huntington.
What was true twenty years ago is true
to-day. Men do not change character as

Mrs. Veronica Baird Tells
v/ of Her Husband's
Violence.
TERRORIZED THE HOUSE.
He Was Addicted to Throwing
Beefsteaks at the
Servants.
THEY TESTIFY AGAINST HIM.
Mr. Baird Alleges That His Wife
Destroyed Her Mother's Picture
in a Fit of Temper.
Veronica Baird took the stand in
Judge Sanderson's court yesterday to ex
plain why she was entitled to a divorce
from her husband, Benjamin H. Baird.
She had complained that her husband
â¢was habitually intemperate and withstood
every art and persuasion that she knew
and practiced to reform him; that under
tne influence of ; liquor he wasted her
substance â she is worth upward of a mil
lionâand treated her cruelly and neglected
her by turns.
Mrs. Baird has been married twice.
Her first husband was an uncle of her
present husband. From the former â¢ she
became possessed of her large fortune.
She had borne children by her first hus
band, and it was her eldest daughter that
a short while ago created a social sensa
tion by eloping with the minor son of
United States Marshal Barry Baldwin.
Mrs. Baird was married to her present
husband, Benjamin H., as short a while
ago as the 15th of December, 1894. Al
most immediately, she testified yester
day, he began the course of intemperance
that has now led her into the divorce
court. Day after day he was accustomed
to coming home either helplessly or
belligerently intoxicated.- She pleaded
with him day by day to quit his evil com
pany and conduct "himself as became a
fentleman of his standing as her hus
and. Every morning she would beg of
him before he left the house not to drink
any Honor that day. He would promise,
but almost as certainly as the sun went
down and evening brought him home he
would be discovered to have broken the
promise. She went to New York, taking
him with her, in the hope that a separa
tion from the boon companions that were
supposed to lead him astray might effect a
reform. - / 7' -77 '.' - "7 *.
They had scarcely' been a day in â  the
Eastern metropolis before Mr. Baird had
found new companions or demonstrated
that companions were not essential in the
premises. He returned to his hotel in the
evening in the same inebriated condition
in which he was given to returning to his
home on Franklin street in this City. After
a short stay in New York they returned
here and Mrs. Baird, in the hope that
business occupation might do for Mr.
Baird what.-her pleading had failed -to do,
made him a director in two. or three cor- i
porations in which she is interested.
' But still it was the same old story. - He
became worse and worse, according to
Mrs. Baird's testimony. He grew violent
and abusive and she and the children be
gan to fear for their lives.' He ..would
chase them about the nouse, and one night
when she had run upstairs and locked her
self in a room with the youngest child he
pursued her and with an ax broke in the
door. - : ;-v : -- , -<:'-' ,â¢
"He terrorized the whole house," said
Mrs. Baird, "and I was in constant fear
of my life. On one occasion he broke into
a rage at the table and threw a beefsteak
at one of the servants." ;
Mrs. Baird's daughter, a coachman and
a sewing-maid testified for the complain
ant, corroborating much of her testimony.
The case will go on to-day.
Lawyer Hurd represents Mrs. Baird and
Reel Terry "is attorney for the husband.
Mr. Baird was in court and is fighting
the petition. He has filed a cross-com
plaint, denying many of the allegations in
that of his wife and declaring that she is
a woman of violent and ungovernable
temper. He cites one instance of her
being in a passion and his attempt to re
monstrate with and then to restrain her
from committing any violence. broke
away from him, and before he could again
restrain her she destroyed a large and
valuable painting of her mother which
was hanging on the wall.
PRINCE LUIGI OF ITALY.
The Nephew of Humbert Has a
Lively First Day in This
City.
After Seeing Consul Grimaidi He and
Count Ceni and Prince Poniatowski *
Go to the Races.
The Duke of Abruzzi, known as the
Prince Luigi, the Prince Poniatowski and
Count Ceni, went for a drive yesterday
after many demonstrations in Prince
Luigi's honor.
The Duke had come up from the Italian
training-ship on the water front on which
he arrived from Victoria and repaired to
the Palace Hotel. It is there that Count
Ceni of Rome, the friend of the visiting
Prince, has his temporary abode.
Prince Poniatowski got there from his
California-street home, too, and the three
notable personages set forth. Prince Luigi
had previously met Consul Grimaidi, who
was arranging different entertainments
for him. He had also been ' the recipient
of much attention on the water front be
fore he got uptown.
The Italian ships in port were all decor
ated, in honor of the Prince and the train
ing ship Cristoforo j Colombo. The Salva
tore Cianipa made a particularly fine show
ing. The Caval Here Ciampa, Casabona
and Francisco Ciampa were -also decked
out with flags and their cantains borrowed
considerable bunting from neighboring
ships in order to make a fine showing.
Tee crews of each vessel were remembered
on this occasion and at noon a special
dinner was served and then there was a
half holiday in order that the men might
enjoy themselves ashore. .-â ""
Ihe Italian colony speedily learned that
tne nephew of King Humbert would leave
iue warship about 1:30 p. M. and i make a
â Â»\L n f H lp around the City. The Harrison
onVii lana:n e was accordingly crowded

to the conclusion that it was a . United

Cristoforo Colombo paying his respects to
the Prince of Savoy. When Captain Lewis
stepped ashore the crowd made ! a lane for
him and stood. with bared heads while the
pood-looking British skipper marched
through their - ranks like a conqueror.
Never again will that Britisher have as
much deference shown him as when the
crowd took him for a United I States Sena
tor. â 'â¢ -. â¢ â "â --â¢
A few minutes after the landing of Cap
tain Lewis the Colombo's cutter came
alongside the float and Prince Luigi and
his two aids-de-camp came ashore."* They
were not in uniform and it was hard to tell
which was which. There was not much
time given lor speculation, as the entire
party got into a buck at once and were
driven away. -.*" \'\ "' "â 
Prince Luigi and Commander Bertolini
returned the visit of Cay. Bruni Grimaidi
at the Italian consulate. The call was a
very brief and formal one and no outsiders
were admitted to the interview between
the Italian Consul and his distinguished
guest.
The consulate is in the same building
with the Italian Chamber of Commerce,
however, and messages were sent to and
fro to arrange the day for the Prince and
his fellow-officers to be wined and dined
by the members of the chamber. The
visitors intimated that next Monday would
suit their convenience perfectly, but as
the Maple hall was already engaged for
that date the invitation was finally ac
cepted for Tuesday, the 11th inst. About
sixty members of the local Italian colony
will be present at the banquet.
Before taking leave of Cay. Grimaidi
the Prince and Commander Bertolini sig
nified their willingness to be present at
the ball for the benefit of the free Italian
school, which will take place next Satur
day in California Hall.
Commander Bertolini expressed regret
that for the rest of the week he would be
unable to receive any visits on board the
Cristoforo Colombo. For the last . six
months, he informed the Italian Consul,
his cruiser has been almost constantly at
sea, the visits paid to various ports during
that time having been only of a few days'
duration. In consequence of her - long
cruise the commander considers that his
ship requires a thorough spring cleaning
before being submitted to the critical eyes
of the American public,' and he has set his
men to work to polish everything on
board. Their labors will not be ended till
Saturday night, and on Sunday, from 2 till
-4 o'clock, the Cristoforo Colombo will be
thrown open to all who choose to visit her.
â¢ The drive : which Prince Luigi, Count
Ceni and Prince Poniatowski took was to
Golden Gate Park and thence to the Bay
i District track: >
The Prince was an interested spectator
of the steeplechase event and was appar
ently delighted with the dangerous sport.
Not yet initiated into the intricacies of the
American bookmakers' methods, his High
ness made no wagers, contenting himself
with being an onlooker. The royal party
was shown every courtesy by President
Thomas S H. Williams of the California
Jockey Club and its officials and left the
track with an evident longing to see more
of the "sport of Kings." '

NEW BRIDGE AND TUNNEL.
One That Will Be an Architec

Gate Park. \ "
MINIATURE ARCH OF TITUS.
Driveway for Vehicles, Path for Pe
destrians and Track for
Cyclers.
The work on what will be known as the
north tunnel was commenced in Golden
Gate Park last Monday. This will be the
entrance under the mam drive jto the
future music concourse, from the terminus
of the streetcars on Fulton street. Over
this tunnel there will be built a magnificent
bridge, the plan for .which has been pre
pared by Coxhead & Coxhead, architects
of this City, and accepted by * the Com
missioners. -7 "7:7
The width of the bridge will be 125 feet,
divided as follows: For a driveway for
vehicles, seventy feet; for pathway for
pedestrians twenty-five feet, and 'for a
bicycle track thirty feet. The path for the
pedestrians will.be on the north side, or
right-hand side going toward the ocean,
the driveway will occupy the . center, and
the bicycle track will occupy the southern
[From a design by the architects, Coxhead & Coxhead.]
side, to. connect with the new track for
cyclers that is being constructed south of
of' the main drive. The length of the
bnage will be 100 feet, and the approaches
to it will be marked by granite posts and
chains between each. .Venetian masts at
each end will designate the lines of the
paths for pedestrians and cyclers. â¢''";. â¢â¢
In the center of the bridge there will, be
a granite base with a statue on it, possibly
an equestrian one, to the right of which
teams moving in either direction have
to pass. . On each side of the bridge there
will be a highly ornamented balustrade or
parapet about "four feet in height. At the
ends of these, on each it is proposed to
place granite bases, on which will- rest
groups of bears, emblematic of the State.
Electric lights will illumine the bridge.
Underneath the center of the bridge will
be the tunnel, 130 feet long, or good width,
and 20 feet nigh from the floor to the cen
ter of the arch. The lacings will be of
granite, and the arch : will be patterned
after the famous arch of Titus in Rome.
The interior of the arch is to be of concrete,
which will be, as to the roof, set in panels
to be arranged in a very artistic manner.
On each side of the entrance there will be
sloping grass-mounds, which will add to
the effect. From the north entrance two
paths, each twenty feet wide, will diverge,
one toward the northeast and the other to
the southwest, and lead to Fulton street,
near where the main entrance to the Mid
winter Fair was. - 7*'.
From the southern entrance there will
be the path that w,ill lead to the concourse
and one leading to the museum on the
west, and another to the tunnel under the
circular driveway being constructed around
the concourse, leading to the aviary. .
' "In preparing this design for a bridge
and arch," said Ernest Coxhead, "we have
taKen into consideration the fact that the
Commissioners desired something pictur
esque and attractive, and have, we believe,
produced something that is artistic and
which will be a credit to the park and
something that the people will feel proud
of. 'The work will be ;of i the best work
manship and be done in a style the like of
which has never been seen in this City."
Superintendent McLaren Stated yester
day that the contract 'for the stonework
has not yet been let, but that the excava
tion and the concrete-work will be done by
men in the employ of : the Commissioners.
.' This new tunnel will furnish a safe pass
age to and from .the music course for the
thousands who will visit the spot where
the band will discourse I sweet music on
Sunday afternoons.

R. J. Cooney, collector for the Indian
apolis Furniture Company, has brought
everlasting disgrace i upon himself and his
young wife and child through his passion
for visiting those sinks of iniquity, the
poolrooms, : and wasting the money -col
lected by him for his employers. 7' . '
-On Tuesday morning '^Hamilton ) Page,
president, and G. F. Ochs, secretary, of the
company; called at the office of the '; Chief
of * Police : and reported that '. Cooney had
embezzled $300 which he. had collected
â  from a customer. 7 Detectives Seymour and
hi taker and Policeman Phillips were de
tailed on the case and they very quickly
had Cooney under arrest by covering his
home at 1208 Treat avenue and a barber
shop and a saloon that he used to frequent.
. W hen searched at the City Prison hve or
six : racetrack; handicap 'cards, a couple of
sporting papers containing the results and
tips of the races, several poolroom tickets
and $65 in coin were found in his pockets.
In answer to-" 'questions,:- he said he
thought ;â¢ he â * I had ir embezzled -,? altogether
about $425.,; He acknowledged that he had
disposed of the money by playing against
the races and he thought there : might be
more." "'." ...
- Yesterday President Page saw Cooney
in the ; City Prison and had a long talk
with him, after which a clerk of the com
pany called with the ; collection book f and"
after going carefully over it with Cooney
it was found that the shortage amounted
altogether to $995. - â  "r â â --â : Â» Â«/
""I played it all against the poolroom
horse games," said Cooney, gloomily, "and
I suppose I will have to suffer the conse
quences."
Secretary Ochs swore to a complaint in
Judge Joachimsen's court yesterday charg
ing Cooney with felony embezzlement for
appropriating the $300 bill to his own uses
and purposes.
Cooney is about 25 years of age and had
been employed by the furniture company
as collector for the past eight months.
Like other young men about town, he had
time to visit the poolrooms even though
he could seldom get out to the track.
WATT TO SEE PADEREWSKI
A Line of Sixty Ticket-Buyers
-:'â â 'â  Form and Remain Out
â ":- All Night.
Unusual Interest in the Polish Pianist
Who Is to Appear Here Mon
day Night.
The interest in the famous Polish
pianist, Ignace Paderewski, has assumed
a peculiar condition here.- '777;
Though Paderewski does not appear
till Monday night, and the sale of tickets
will not commence till 9 o'clock this morn
ing, people began standing in line at
Sherman & Clay's, where the tickets are
to be sold, as early as 10 a. m. yesterday.
There was a straggling half-dozen at
first, and the number remained about the
same till toward evening; when it increased
greatly. Before 10 o'clock last night there
were sixty persons by actual count, who
had been engaged to wait out all night' to
buy tickets. One or two speculators were
noticed on the sidewalk.- It had been
expected there would be a", rush for the
tickets, and the object was to make money
out of them.
The regulation price is $5 for, anywhere
on the lower floor, $3 for the balcony and
$2 for the gallery. . The admission price". to
each place is the same as for a seat.
Paderewski is to open at the California
next Monday night. He will appear after
ward at two matinees, namely, on Wednes
day and Friday. These are all the per
formances he is booked to give. Mr. Sher
man of Sherman & Clay said last night
that no more than six tickets would be

HE KEPT ALL THE MONEY
Suit to Recover From Barclay
Henley What His Part
ner Pocketed. â 
A Charge Against Howard Mac Sherry
That Involves Forgery as Well
as Embezzlement.
. Thomas Gibson, a resident of Roseburg,
Or., brought suit in the Superior Court
yesterday Â« against > Barclay Henley . and
Howard Mac Sherry, "attorneys of this
City, to recover $445 alleged to belong" to
plaintiff and :to / have been fraudulently
appropriated by Mac Sherry.
Gibson alleges that he employed Hen
ley & Mac Sherry, and through them an
other attorney, George William Hart of
New York, to effect the settlement and
distribution of the estate ; of Sarah McEl
hany, deceased,; of Brooklyn. : Hart was
to receive for his services 40 per cent of the
moneys due Gibson. The work was done
and $740.10 collected, and Hart sent a
draft drawn to the order of Gibson on the
Madison-square Bank for $445 dated Febru
ary 2, 1893. :. ; ;..7 .'â¢â ;:""â - :.:â â ''.'- ' â ;
The draft was received. by the San Fran
cisco firm, and, without authority, in
dorsed by Mac Sherry j as follows: "Pay to
the order of Henley & Mac Sherry, Thomas
Gibson, Henley & Mac Sherry, *â  Howard
Mac Sherry." | With that indorsement it
was cashed by the First National Bank.' 1 r
Hart, it is alleged, made frequent in
quiry by letter as :to why : the check was
not sent to Gibson, and was answered by
Mac Sherry to the effect that he had power
of ) attorney for * indorsing I and I collecting
the money, but did not say as to whether
it had been sent Gibson. To Gibson, Mac-
Sherry denied at first that he had received
the money. 7 Later; in. June, Mac Sherry
wrote ':-; that he 'i had received a draft, and
when ; collected Ihe would remit. Gibson
declares he has never received the money,
although he has since learned the facts in
the case, as he states them. He sues to re
cover the amount. s?zs&Â£Â£ggj& "

A GENERAL OVERHAULING.
Coming Investigation Into the
State of the Bering Sea
Fleet.
DISMAY AMID THE OFFICERS.
!.â ".'â ' V:"-' â  â  ''"' \
The . Healy ' Inquiry Drawing to a
;i Closeâ Daniels Case Next
in Order.
.It now appears as though the Healy in
vestigation were to be merely the premon
itory rumble preceding a seismic upheaval
in the maritime revenue service. \ A gen
tleman' thoroughly competent to speak on
the matter was heard to remark yesterday:
"The treasury officials at Washington
are about -disgusted v with the tales of
drunkenness, disorder and anarchy in the
Bering Sea fleet, and have made up
.their minds to institute [&\ general and
searching inquiry into the actual state of
things, with a view to keeping the compe
tent' officers and' getting, rid of the re
mainder. " The weeding out^process will,
it is. believed, v result; disastrously ; in the
cases j of many s officers who now imagine,
or until recently have imagined, that they
were settled for life in an easy, lucrative
service.
"Captain Healy' case will oniy take a
day or so longer, and then we may as well
look out for fireworks. The old captain,
by reason of his rank, his unimpeachable
record and the flimsy nature of many of
the charges against him, has been, treated
with every consideration; and will, un
doubtedly come through the j ordeal with
out a scratch ; \ but [ the younger officers,
particularly those who have been most
active in stirring up strife and trouble,
will be handled without gloves. -" V
; "The old, experienced men who have
the investigation in charge are not triflers.
Captain Stodder is the sole survivor of the
Monitor's brave staff of officers, with the
exception of the vessel's aged commander,
the venerable Worden, long since honor
ably retired from the service,. Surely a
man who could hold hi 3 own in the great
naval battle between the Monitor and the
Merrimac must have grit enough to make
the young men in the revenue fleet come
to time. The poor youngsters are shaking
in their boots, too, and no mistake about it.
"Then there is Hooper, the admiral and
darling of the fleet. He will have his little
say as well. Hodgson and Smith, captains
of long experience, are also to take part in
the investigation, which, I tell you, will
be a warm affair. But I've said too much
already,!'; concluded- the bonnie boy in
blue, "and if you put my name in the
paper it would make big trouble for me. I
don't want to be hauled over the coals,
like poor Captain Healy was, for speaking
to newspaper people," and the gentleman
vanished whither feet profane might not
presume to tread. .
; The first witness at the investigation
was Lieutenant I Emery, who aired a seri
ous grievance inflicted upon him by his re
doubtable superior.
"On one occasion," he stated, "Captain
Healy said that Daniels, Dorry and I were
not fit associates for captains of vessels,
and that * boat-steerers would be good
enough company for our kind of people.
He called Dorry a liarâ called him up on
deck to insult him â during June and
August was dreadfully drunk, though the
cutter was' amid the ice and in great dan
ger. .. . 7. '"' â â â¢.' ; ;.â¢â -, â 
"There was' no discipline at all aboard
the Bear. The captain let the sailors have
a bugle and accordion, and- they used to
keep me awake night after night with the
diabolical racket they made singing, danc
ing, blowing the bugle and try.ng to play
the other instrument whenever, they felt
like it. The = captain used to let Lieuten
ant Buhner insult me and the other offi
cers, and used . to insult us himself when
he was intoxicated." - '
" : "Did â¢ the . captain's conduct ever inter
fere with the : safety or proper manage
ment of the vessel?" was asked in a sin
gularly direct and incisive tone. ./ â¢
Emery/ ruminated : deeply for quite a
space, and then responded: ' :-' 7
"No; sir; it did not." '
Assistant 7 Engineer Schwartz testified
that ; the captain * sometimes drank rather
heavily, but was a superior seaman. .. The
cutter was managed with : fidelity and effi
ciency, and .the witness never knew his
commander to give an erroneous or inac
curate order. The - discipline of the ship,
he said, was perfect. At .sea the captain
"tolerated no nonsense," but was most in
dulgent in allowing the ; officers to ? seek
amusement ashore when the cutter was in
port. The witness knew of "a number of
fishing ' and , hunting expeditions '; organ
ized by the officers, which Â« the captain
permitted; and in which he seemed to
take much interest.' ...â¢.â '", -,?â¢; â¢ *;
> Second Assistant Engineer Dorry said the
captain had summoned him on deck and
called him a liar; also that the captain had
been much intoxicated during the months
of June and August^ 1895.;: When the cap
tain; arrested White no; record, was made
on the cutter's log to that effect. â -?'â¢'..
;7 Lieutenant Wadsworth complained that
two years ago j the captain' had shipped a
number of .seamen, which duty, the wit
ness I claimed, devolved 'upon l himself,- he
being first lieutenant at that time. Lieu
tenant George E. McConnell testified to the
same effect. > "-.. *; '
First ; Lieutenant Buhner, temporarily
in command of the Bear," said he had seen
the captain drink during the months men
tioned in the complaint, but never to such
an? extent as ito incapacitate him for the
performance of his duties, in which he was
scrupulously exact. ' -.. .Â.

fied in accordance with ' the statements
made by their predecessors on the stand,
an adjournment was taken until to-day. - :
y-t In a day or two the ; Healy investigation
will be â¢ finished, f and* it fi is ''.. the general

JOSEPH KING INDORSED.
The Supervisor, and. the Committee of
the K. R.B.
The following communication from the
committee of K. R. B. for the 4th of March
celebration, indorsing Supervisor King, is
self-explanatory : .:
San Francisco, February 5, 1896.
At a general meeting of the 4th of March
committee of the K. R. B. organization, held in
their hall last evening, a general discussion on
the publication of articles published in the
San Francisco Call and Chronicle, which
articles spoke disparingly of Supervisor Joe
King as a member of the reception committee
to receive the lion. John F. Finnerty, it was
unanimously resolved by all of the members
of the general committee that the statements
contained in said articles concerning the for
mation of the committee, and the alleged
declinations of the members thereof, were en
tirely false. â¢:
The general l committee has full confidence
in each and every one of the members of the
reception committee, including Joseph King,
and instead of declining, as asserted in said
articles, they have each and all of them ac
cepted the appointment. The general com
mittee furthermore believe that the publica
tions referred to were inspired by malicious
motives and suggested by the enemies of the
Irish national cause.

EXPENSIVE SOUP.
Policeman Altkcn Fined for Sipping It
"While on Duty, and Two Other
Officers Heavily Mulcted.
The Police . Commissioners had a long
session last night, thiee patrolmen and a
sergeant having appeared before them to
answer to various charges.
Joseph Gorevau was fined $100 for sleep
ing while on station duty, William J.
Mangan.?so for unofficer-like conduct, and
James H. Aitken $20 for violating the rules
of the department in eating soup while on
duty.
Sergeant Blank was charged on the com
plaint of Dr. Twist with unofficer-like con
duct. The sergeant met the dentist late
one night on Ashbury . Heights and the
latter took refuge . behind a shed. Two
patrolmen were with the sergeant and they
surrounded . the shed. Blank asked the
dentist his . name, and he replied it was
none of his business. He then asked what
he was doing there and got the same re
ply. Blank then ordered the two patrol
men to : search the dentist for a weapon.
The Commissioners at once dismissed the
charge and told the dentist that as a rep
utable citizen it was his amy to have an
swered the sergeant's questions. â 
Charles W. Armager was appointed as a
special officer to take the beat vacated by
the death of Patrick Hussey. . The board
refused to reopen the case of ex- Policeman

THE FATE OF A TAMALE.
How the Plaintiff in a Divorce Suit on
One Occasion Dropped a Hot _
Stove.
- â¢ â¢â > . . .'.â¢â -â -.
The case of William J. Kennedy against
Catherine, his wife, for divorce, was begun
before Judge Slack yesterday morning.
Kennedy is an engineer in the Fire De
partment Engine' Company 9. He
charges his wife with cruelty and deser
tion. Kennedy testified that his wife
created such frequent ! disturbances about
the engine-house, No. 17 on Mint avenue,
to which he was attached, that the Chief
Engineer said he could- not stand it and
transferred him to No. 9.
Tbe trouble between the couple began in
July, 1894, at which time the wife, accord
ing to the testimony, had fallen into the
habit of going to entertainments without
| asking his leave. She went to a
suburban picnic against, his protest, and
from that time forward there was trouble.
Kennedy took his wife to the Orpheum
some time later and after the theater was
out suggested that they go to a certain
place for a taraale. He had never been to
the place, but his wife had admitted that
she had gone there with her sister, a lady
friend and two young men.
He wanted to see the character of the
place. Mrs. Kennedy led the way to a
private room and touched the electric but
ton for a waiter, and altogether showed so
much familiarity with the place that the
husband declared it was time for them to
separate. He told his wife she was "get
ting too fly, traveling too speedy" to suit
him. He testified also that she confessed
to him having visited a place of ill repute
with a woman friend.
Colonel O'Byrne, attorney for the wife,
who sat beside him, cross-examined the
husband at great length. He asked for
particulars about the scene at the "tamale
joint on Kapp street."
Mrs. Kennedy whispered to her attorney.
"Oh!" said the Colonel, "I am not 'up'
on these places. Tell us about the scene
at Captain Street's tamale joint."
Under the cross-examination the wife
produced a rather handsome black cloak
cut to pieces and asked him to explain how
it came so. ,
He said it was part of an outfit his wife
had purchased with money he furnished
just previous to their marriage. That
afterward, when his wife took to. keeping
company of which he did not approve,
she was about to give the cloak to ncr sis
ter. He thereupon cut the cloak to prevent
her doing so.
Mrs. Kennedy also exhibitefi a box con
taining the fragments of the ornaments
that had decorated their wedding cake,
and Colonel O'Byrne asked the witness
how they came to be broken in that
fashion. â¢
"After we separated," he said, "and my
wife had taken all that she wanted from
our rooms, she left these upon the mantel,
saying that I might decorate my room
with tbem. . I threw them upon the floor."
Colonel O'Byrne wanted to know about a
certain occasion when Kennedy threw an
oil stove out of the window. He explained
it. He forbade his wife Keeping compauy
with a certain young girl. She went
away with the girl, however, and her sis
ter, and returning to the , house . they
climbed into a back window, got upstairs
and were cooking supper on the stove
when he discovered their presence.
He climbed the stairs, and, picking up
the stove, was going to carry it down, but
it burned his hands and he tossed it out of
the open window.
A physician testified to having treated
Mrs." Kennedy for/ contusions upon the
side and hip. The bruises, it was alleged
by the respondent, were inflicted by Mr.
Kennedy. Kennedy declared they were
the result of a fall from a bicycle while his
wife was riding in the park, and at a time
subsequent to their separation.
The case will be resumed Saturday
morning. - ' â¢

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
, NNEA r YORK, N. V., Feb. 5.-Business at the
Stock Exchange was virtually crowded into the
last hour of trading, and during this time commis
sion houses had no reason to complain of a luck of
orders. Early in the day brokers and operators
were waiting to hear from AVashtngton in the mat
ter of the bond issue. The success of the loan was
generally admitted weeks ago, but the amount of
the bidsâ nearly $600,000,000â slmplv astonished
the street. The price, too, was a great deal ben er
than expected, the average being above 110. The
syndicate bid, It will be remembered, was under
105. The magnitude of the bids and the prices
tenaered led to general buying of the market, and
prices moved up anywhere from % to 2% percent.
Sugar was a feature, and after fulling from
108% to 107%, rose to 109%. The early gain
was the result of the passing of the sugar bounty
by the Bundesrath.' In the last hour the shorts
were the mest conspicuous buyers. Leather pre- i
ferred moved up from 64% to 67% on reports i
from Boston that the money for the February I
dividend was in the bank. The AYesiern stocks, I
such as St. Paul, Rock Island and Burlington and
Quincy were iv better demand on the splendid
showing of earnings recently published. Specula
tion closed' strong, with an advancing tendency.
The total sales were 290,000 shares.
Bonds were active and strong. The sales footed
up $1,944,000. Atchison adjustment fours rose 2

CHICAGO MARKETS;
. CHICAGO, Ili., Feb 5.-The wheat market
this morning was in exact contrast to that of yes
terday. Strength was the predominant tone where
yesterday all was weakness. A gain of 3/ 8 to s/ gC
was recorded' at the opening, ah explanation of the
change in sentiment being difficult to find. At the
end of the first thirty minutes the; buying became
furious and prices climbed a cent and a half from
the then ruling quotations within a -very short
period. .It was learned â  when the flurry was on
that New York had many foreign buying orders
accompanying advices of serious damage to the
Argenilne crop. The advance met with determined
but futile resistance, hardly a . pause . taking place
until 68% c for May was toucned. The routine
statistical information was commonplace. .Re
ceipts in the Northwest were 446 cars, against 441
last Wednesday and 101 , a year ; ago. Chicago re
ceived 145 cars and inspected out - 60,146 bushels.
Liverpool -opening, cables were quiet and easy.
Closing ones were a | farthing higher. | Continental
markets reported declines. :> At noon 1 Bradsireet's
reported a decrease in the world's available supply,
exclusive of the Pacific Coast, of 3.900,000. For
the mouth the Pacific stocks decreased 1.227.000
bushels. After the announcement was made the
market^ and advanced slightly but tailed to
hold, a quick slump of 11*0 following. "Export
clearances at the Atlantic seaboard were 348,000
bushels. At the close there was a rally from the
inside. May wheat opened from 67' to 6< Vic. so"d
between 66%cand 68' 2 c. closing at 67S/ B e, '/*c
Higher than' yesterday. Estimated receipts for
; to-morrow. 60 cars. - ... _Â
CORNâ Responded feebly tothe burst of strength
shown by wheat early. Business was quiet by com
parison with that of the filler grain. Receipts were
-203 cars and 50.804 bushels were taken from store.
Liverpool cables were easy and 1 4<l lower. Brad
street's reported an increase in available stocks of
2,407,000 bushels. Export clearances were 119,
--983 bushels. The weakness which attacked wheat
later in tne session was also felt In corn, prices re
ceding in consequence. May corn opened from
30V'+c to 30s/ c, advanced to 30s/ 8 Â®30%c. closing
at 30i4@30s/ B e, a shade higher than yesterday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow 140 cars.
- OATSâ Were firm early through sympathy with
the other markets. No particular : interest was
â  manifested in the trade. Shorts covered with some
freedom, thus helping prices. ; Receipts were 160
cars. There were no withdrawals from store. JBrad
street's reported an increase in stocks of 5. 8,000
bushels. Prices reflected the later weakness of
wheat. May oats closed 'Unchanged ! from yester
day. : Estimated receipts for to-morrow 110 cars.
FLAX â Was steady. Cash, . 9iy 2 c: February,
90i âc; May. 95J. B Vac. Receipts were 30 cars.
PROVISIONSâ a weaker hog market was a dis
couraging factor in product at the opening; but
the buoyancy of wheat offset that influence and
resulted in an improvement which > was subse
quently lost in the general declining movement.
At. the close the feeling was steady with May pork
7\%C higher than yesterday, May lard 6@7i/ 2 c
higher and May ribs 5c higher.

Prospects for a Large Yield and a Good
'.. Demand This Year. "
1 The circular of .the Cutting Packing Company
says: , "The abundant rains : for j the â  past ; month
have settled the ! question of an abundant . 1896
crop, so far as moisture is concerned, the only un
certain element now being that of late frosts. ' As
there \ was ho ! crop in â  1895 exceptionally \ large,
there Is no occasion for a shortage ;la 1896, and
there should be an extra heavy crop of apricots in
many localities where there was a practical failure
last year. Actual 'stocks have been changed but
little, save In the point where held, many parcels
having been shipped to Eastern points on consign
ment and ; many old contracts on which balances
remained .unshipped having gone forward lon ac
count of the advance in freight rates from 68 to 75
cents, taking-effect January 24. :.-..â -,.â¢,â¢:, ,
_â¢ "Beyond tbese movements, which really cut no

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1896.
been nothing done, 1 - sales having been confined .-. to
the lowest {possible point necessary- to keep up
necessary stocks. Jobbers and wholesalers i paid
little attention to the advance in freight rates so
far as purchases went, the chief anxiety appearing
to bo on the part : of camiers with surplus stocks
striving to get them into a possible future market
at a low freight rate. This will . doubtless militate
against there being many f. o. b. carload or larger
sates in the near future, and Iwe look for scarcely
any business except â â¢ territorial, and ; possibly a
light export trade. So ; far -as varieties go as to
prices, there is little to say, there being no demand
for apricots, peaches in fair demand, pears a short
commodity, while plums, grapes and small fruits
are held at buyers' - values. Export trade . pay no
attention whatever to inquiries or offers.
"Altogether we feel that stocks, both here and at
Eastern domestic as well' as foreign points, are
ample for all legitimate requirements,. and that
there will be but little change in present values
until the quantity and quality of the new crop is
more definitely established. There have been
several changes in the ' personnel ' and financial
condition of the business generally on the coast,
most of, which influence a reduction in output;
while, on the other band, there are several-new
enterprises reported, which practically offset any
reduction from | other causes and will result in a
heavier output than ; heretofore if no change Is
made in the public programme. While there is no
apparent good reason for any increase in the
number of packing-houses the fact remains, and is
too well known to excite comment, that there are
always new elements, both personal and financial,
entering Into the business every year sufficient to
set aside any established or definite conclusions."
THE SALMON TRADE.
The Cutting Packing Company's circular says of
salmon: No transactions in this article outside of
trade from ' second | hands. | Stocks of first-class j
goods are light; of poorer quality, ample supplies.
The usual preparatory activity incident to this sea
son of the year is manifest in all directions. On
the Columbia River, where last year's price of raw
fish bids fair to be maintained, the various canner
ies are making contracts for fishermen, giving out
twine for new gear and putting j boats and nets in
order for a vigorous ca mnaign. The Alaska pack
ers are likewise making engagements of men and
supplies, and in a. couple of months from now
crafts will be winging their way northward for
th eir six months', work, ,
There are rumors on "the street" that the num
ber of canneries in Alaska waters will be Increased
this year - by the ventures of some parties not
heretofore in the business, attracted -no doubt by
â¢â he apparent prosperity of others already there
; engaged. On Puget Sound also it is said lliat quite
; a number . of new 1 canneries will ' be started this
year. AH of, these things indicate that there will
; be no scarcity : of canned salmon in the fall of
1896, when the catch of the year should come to
hand, and yet, on account of the chances of mis-,
haps of one kind and another, it is hard to predict
with any certainty that the aggregate amount of
the pack will equal that of the past year. : â s - 'â -;
THE OUTLOOK FOR TOMATOES.
The circular of a local packing company says:
Canned tomatoes are in the dumps and it is quite a
problem to figure how the holders of speculative
stocks will come out. Taking the statistics of the
country as a whole, and of the coast , in particular,
it is not probable that packers' will pack nearly as
heavily as for several years previous to 1895.
The email margin of profit uuder the best condi
tions is not encouraging to a large pack. This
feeling may enable present holdings to be kept up
in price so as to get speculators' carrying expenses, i
and it is about the only element of encouragement
in sight. While choice goods are held nominally
at 72y 2 c, a close buyer can' fill his wants at 70c
easily, and possibly ot 67V&C, with gallons at $2 10
to $2 15. ,-

IN A RUSSIAN GOAL MINE
Officer Esmond Receives News
of His Long-Imprisoned
Son.
WAS AEEESTED FOR SEALING.
The Captain of His Vessel Abandoned
the Crew of the Boat to
Their Fate.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Feb. 5. j
An able seaman named H. Schuitz, who
arrived in port a few days ago, brought
information of great interest to Officer W.
F. Esmond of Golden Gate.
A couple of years ago James Esmond, a
son of the officer, sailed from Yokohama,
Japan) on the Anaconda, under the com
mand of Captain Hansen, on a sealing
voyage to Bering Sea. Since sailing
nothing has been heard of the young man,
though the ship has frequently been heard
of as being on the Japanese coast. When
. Schuitz came into San Francisco on the
ship Pekin, he told the story of having
â¢ just escaped from a Russian prison located
in some one of the islands claimed by that
nation in the northern seas. He said that
he had been sent there as a penalty for
being caught killing seals upon the islands
claimed by Russia, and that while thus
imprisoned and compelled to work in the
coal mine, young Esmond was one of his
companions up to the time of his own
escape, which he accomplished after great
hardships two months ago.
Officer Esmond went to San Francisco
to-day to find Schuitz and endeavor to
learn from him just where his son, who is
imprisoned for some offense, is located.
He will then take steps to secure his son's
release. Schuitz says that Captain Han
sen deserted the boat in . which Esmond
was when he saw it was in danger. Es
mond will also try to find out if it will be
possible to punish Captain Hansen for his
cowardly desertion of his crew and his
long and unjustifiable silence on the sub
ject.
THE OAKLAND HARBOR.
Memorial to Congress Signed by Many
Prominent Citizens.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 5. j
The following memorial was forwarded
to Washington to-night:
Oakland. Cal., Feb. 3, 1896.
To Hon. George C. Perkins, United States Sen
ate ; Hon. Stephen M White, United States Sen
ate ; Hon. S. 0. Hilborn, Hon. John A. Barham,
Hon. drove L. Johnson, Hon. James G. Maguire,
Hon. Eugene F. Loud, Hon. James MclMcnland
and Hon. W. W. Rowers, Mambers House oj
Representativesâ Gentlemen: We the under
signed residents of Oakland, California, do re
spectfully request that you urge upon Con
gress the great necessity of the immediate
dredging of a deep-water channel from our
wharves to the bay of San Francisco. We are
informed upon reliable authority that an aver
age depth' of twenty feet at low water can be
obtained from our wharves to the bay for the
Bum of $250,000. Our city of 60,000 inhabi
tants is suffering for the want of deep water,
and on the one article of coal our inhabitants
are obliged to pay at least 50 per cent per ton
additional on account of sea-going vessels be
ing obliged to partially unload In San Fran
cisco..
'-â  The material in the bottom of the channel is
iiardpan and cannot be. removed except by
dredging. This work is recommended in the
United States Engineer's last report as being
the most important work to be completed first,
and you Will also find from the reports that
the deep-water channel which we ask to have
extended westerly to the bay has not filled up
to any extent during the past year. We do
protest against the interference in our harbor
affairs of outside parties, who are not residents
J or who do not represent our business interests,
and we insist that any appropriation made for
our harbor shall be expended for deepening
the aforesaid channel to the bay until the
same shall be completed. Respectfully yours,

OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. s.â The Board

He complains that the Mayor, who is

of the Mayor's office be stirred up. The

Expert Shiels Testifies This Time for
7 the Railroad.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb s.â The suit of
Colonel Wettstein against the Southern
Pacific is still prolific of expert medical
testimony. The defense opened to-day
with the testimony of Dr. G. F. Shiels. In
answer to questions, he said he did not
have a pass and was not wearing a cor
poration collar.
In reply to a subsequent question Dr.
Shiels replied that "if the condition to
which " Dr. r Woolsey had testified were
present the plaintiff would be a physical
wreck. SmÃÂ£Hs& : '
"It would be a moral impossibility for
them to exist and the plaintiff to appear
and act as he does," continued the witness.
''A physical impossibility?" suggested
Judge Ogden.
"A physical impossibility, yes;. I beg
your nardon," replied the doctor..
This afternoon when the court assem
bled the defense had been provided not
only with a spinal column, but a whole
skeleton.
Attorney Moore asked Dr. Shiels to lo
cate the point of greatest mobility in the
spinal column. He said it was at the '
cervical vertebrae instead of the lumbar,
where it was located by Dr. Woolsey.
Dr. Shiels then picked up the skeleton
by the back of the neck before the jury and
indicated the points to which he referred.
"Handle gently this relic of . mortality,"
remarked Attorney Moore.
Dr. Shiels in reply to Attorney Moore de
clared that cases of concussion and shock
of the spinal cord are rare. He further
stated that malingering or feigning injury
is very common. He came across many
cases while a pension examiner for the
United States Government.
The witness said in reply to Attorney
Moore that "auto-suggestion" was a con
dition of mind by which a person would
come to think that they were suffering
irom a malady not real but only imaginary.
The witness explained cases of this na
ture. He also told about litigative symp
toms and reflex actions, and the case was
continued.
TOOK A NIGHT OFF.
No Burglaries Committed in the City
East Night.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 5. â No bur
glaries were reported at the City Hall to
day. Last night the Chief and most of
the officers patrolled the city all night.
Several officers offered to do double duty,
and their offer was accepted. ' * \-
Chief Lloyd said to-day that he knew
where the opposition to his department
came from. "The gamblers and illicit sa
loon men don't like me a little bit," said
the Chief. "They don't like the way that
I have been raiding their joints. So; when
there is a burglary they shout that I am
incompetent and want me removed. Of
course th/y would like to get rid of me, as
they then could run their places again un
molested.
"What we need here is more men in
this department. I have not enough men
now to properly patrol the city. This de
partment has been constantly kept down
on the plea of economy, while the city has
been growing." JBTffllirF'r^ffi
: J. T. Moran, the ingenious Broadway
merchant, has had good luck with
his novel but effective burglar scare
crow. Ho has not had good luck with
patent alarms and night watchmen,
so he has fixed up a dummy and put it to
bed in his store. When the burglars look
in and see this sleeping figure they desist
and go elsewhere for their plunder.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY^ FEBRUARY 6, 1896.
FIREMEN HAVE REVENGE.
They Rejoice That Murdock Is
No Longer the Fire
Warden.
HOW IT ALL CAME ABOUT.
While Resting in Fancied Security,
Enemies Destroyed His Politi- .
. cal Pedestal.
_â¢-â -â¢ :
Oakland Office, San Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, Feb. 5. f
.The appointment of W. B. Smith as As
sistant Chief Engineer and Fire Warden
of the department has brought to light a
little story the first chapter of which had
its origin at the great St. Mary's College
lirj two years ago. After the fire, Fire
Warden Murdock made complaints of
drunkenness against four fireman. It was
stated that they.broke into the refectory
during the fire and became intoxicated and
unfit for doty.
Mainly upon the evidence of Murdock
the fireman were dismissed from the de
partment. They longed for an opportu
nity to get even and recently it came. The
: Council determined : to get rid of both as
sistant engineers, but the Commissioners
did not care to shoulder the responsibility,
it was stated, on account of ante-election
pledges.
The Council, therefore, by ordinance
abolished the office of first assistant.
This, of course, let Miles Doody out. Then
the office of second assistant and FireWar
den was abolished, and this, of course, let
out Fred Murdock. As it would be impos
sible to run the department without an
assistant, the office of first assistant and
FireWarden was created. Murdock did not
dream of opposition; and felt confident
that he would keep along the same as
ever, and that the change of name was
merely a formality that would not affect
him. â¢
But while Murdock' slumbered in finan
cial security, his opponents and enemies
were active. The Fire Warden discovered,
when too late, that his castle of future
official life had been built on sand, and
j when he started in to rebuild he found he
had been undermined entirely.
The firemen discharged at St. Mary's
had lots of friends, and the prospect of j re
venge was very sweet. They added their
weight to that of the opposition, and yes
terday's meeting was somewhat of a sur
prise to the old guard, as the last one was
let out. W. B. Smith was elected to tho
new position, and -Murdock is wondering
yet how it was done.
With Doody left without a place, Mur
dock di*to, and Chief Lawton succeeded
a week ago by W. H. Fair, the entire head
of the department has been chanced. With
the last change the four men discharged
two years ago consider that they are re
venged. .. 7' '.;
W. B. Smith, the new Fire Warden, is
an experienced fireman and has been fore
man of a chemical engine for some years.
Now that there is a new set of officers the
work of reorganizing will proceed.

UNIVERSITY BASEBALLERS
Berkeley Freshmen Defeat the
Sophomores by a Score of
15 to 7.
Intercollegiate Debateâ Suits Against
the Town Threatenedâ Death
of an Old Pioneer.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. The fresh
men won the first college baseball game
of the season to-day from the sophomores
by a score of 15 to 7. This was the first
contest of any kind, with the exception of
an unimportant basket-ball game, which
the sophomores have, lost since they en
tered the university. As a consequence
they took their defeat hard.
The freshmen went at their work like
veterans on the diamond, and by the end
of the first inning they had secured eight
runs, but their fast work did not last long,
as after this inning their scoring was done
only by degrees. Only seven innings were
played on account of the lateness of > the i
hour. Following were the players and

SAN LEANDRO MAY FIGHT
Citizens Aroused Over the Oppo
sition to Electric Light
Bonds.
SERIOUS TROUBLE LOOKED FOR.
The Old Gas Companies Attempt to
Defeat the Unanimous Will of
the People.
SAN LEANDRO, Cal., Feb. s.â There is
a strong spirit of unrest here that is liable
to breakout at any time, against the elec
tric railroad company. It is reported that
there are clubs and bombs J stored in , the
town that were intended for use should
the company have persisted in its attempt
to lay a double track through the town. It
is likely that another use may be found
for them before long. V ; 7
A few days ago there was a conference
between the railroad people and the Town
Trustees, and that the railroad people did
and said everything they were asked. The
surprise was great that the corporation
which has hitherto showed no regard or
respect for anybody or anything, should so
completely cave down the bank, after their
lawyers had advised them that they had
tne law on their side. The action on the
part of the company was viewed with sus
picion, which it now seems was well
founded.
About a month ago the people of the
town decided by an almost unanimous
vote to issue $10,000 in bonds for the pur
pose of building a municipal electric-light
plant. The town at present is supplied
with gas only, and. the gas company is
practically the same as the electric road
company. The gas company decided to
fight, the bond issue, as a municipal elec
tric piant meant that a useless gas plant
would soon be on tbeir hands. â¢ It was
realized that no one would patronize the
gas company after the electric-light plant
was working, and a plan was decided to
prevent the issue, or at least to delay it as
long as possible.
As the railroad trouble occurred soon
after the election and as the gas plant had
to be protected right away, a deceitful lull
was permitted to settle over the railroad
affair and the tight against the bonds was
taken up.
When the Trustees met â , Monday night
j to open the bids they were served with a
[ suit brought against the town to prevent
the issuance of bonds. The suit is brought
against the city of San Leandro and the
Trustees individually and the court is
asked to restrain them from issuing or
selling bonds for the erection of an electric
light plant and also to enjoin the city and
Trustees from engaging in the business of
supplying electric light to the city or to
any other person for profit or otherwise.
The nominal plaintiff, A. C. Hammond
Jr., is an accountant in the employ of W.
J. Landers of the electric road, who also
owns the majority of stock in the gas com
pany. In spite of the opposition of the
gas and electric road companies the bonds
carried by an almost unanimous vote.
The main contention of the plaintiff is
that the Board of Trustees did not, before
the question . of incurring said indebted
ness lor the improvement was submitted
to a vote of the ! electors, have plans and
estimates submitted by a competent engi
: neer or architect who had successful ex
j perience in such work.
â¢The Town Attorney denies that compe
j tent advice was not taken, and says that
I the suit is simply for the ' purpose of
j harrassing and annoying, and has no
foundation in fact. Everybody realizes
! now that the railroad trouble was only ;
| ended, so smoothly for the purpose of ,
I arousing a feeling favorable to the gas j
company, and the indignation is higher !
now than ever. It would not take a very
hot-headed man to start serious trouble.
The report of the storing of the checks
and books has been sent in to the Sheriff
at Oakland, and he is investigating the
case.
The Sheriff Will Not Talk,
Sheriff White was seen to-night and told
of the report from San Leandro.
"I cannot discuss the . matter at all,"
said tho Sheriff. "If any more trouble
should : arise I am quite able to attend to
it. 1. have not considered it necessary. to
station any permanent deputies out there."
VERY SHORT MEMORIES
Letters From Place-Hunters Who
Want Mayor Davie Im
peached.
The Mayor Preparing to Show the
Foundation of the Present Attack
on His Administration.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
&08 Broadway, Feb. 5. )
It is very evident that the people who
are trying to place frocks in the official
career of Mayor Davie have very short
lived memories. They have forgotten
some very interesting letters that they
wrote just after election, and which have
been â â  carefully -' preserved in a private
drawer in- the 'Mayor's desk. While the
so-called impeachment proceedings are in
progress the Mayor is unearthing these
letters/and some of them leave no doubt
as to the motive that prompts the present
movement adverse to his administration.' 7
7 These letters are : considered - by 7 the
Mayor as confidential, â¢ and he will not
permit the names of the writers to be made
public until such time as it is necessary to
refute the statements that are now being
compiled by bis enemies. They go? to
prove that politics are the same in the new
and the old parties, and that the ante-elec
tion ''"unselfish desires"- are rapidly sup
planted by the "honest" desire to serve
the public after the votes are counted.
"I have a mass of matter here," said the
Mayor to-day, "that I am . getting into
shape as fast as possible. Ido not pro
pose to : allow illiterate, fifty-dollar-a
month clerks or handlers of so-called Pop
ulist organs to '; impugn -my motives and
throw mud on my administration without
a protest. lam not going to be in a hurry,
though 'I; intend: to let them show their
colors in good style, and then I think I
can sail in and turn the tables. These
very fellows must have forgotten that they
have previously put themselves on record
as place-hunters, but I have not, and am
about ready to throw a sidelight on the
present trouble. I have one bundle of
Fetters here, and they are a pretty good ar
gument in the case." ;,:; - '
One of the letters was as follows:
' f . Dear Mayor: 7 I think \I ' would make a first
class license inspector. If you think the same
I would like the job. The revenue would , be
particularly welcome just now. Loyally yours.
j â '; "Loyally yours," : repeated the - Mayor,
'with an expression that did not admit of
two interpretations. / . "Here's another:"
'? Hon. J. L. Davieâ Sib: 7 1 understand
there t are :. to be some change ~on . the police
force and I would like to suggest a few names
to you. All I will mention are good Populists.
Yours. : .; â .-,â
7. There were several others that dealt with
details that it would be a breach of confi
dence to make public, but the Mayor says
he will use them all, if : necessary, to offset
the impeachment proceedings.
THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE.
General Harrison Asserts No Incumbent
Has Satisfied All the People.
Ex-President Harrison writes on "The
Presidential Office". in his "This Country
of Ours" series, in February Ladies' Home
Journal. In discussing the constitutional
provisions for the selection of â  a chief
magistrate ho touches upon the discussion
in the convention relative to a plural ex
ecutive for the Nation, and upon the point
presents his own views: "Experience has
fully justified .the conclusion reached by
the constitutional convention in this mat
ter [a ; single executive head] that' no
change has ever been suggested. The in
cumbent has never satisfied every one, but
the discontented have never sought relief
by giving him a double.
i t "Executive direction should always be
single. When anything is wrongly done
we must be able to put a hand on the man
who did it. The sense of responsibility
begets carefulness, and that. sense is never
so perfect as when, after full consultation,
the officer must go alone into the chamber
of decision. In all of the recent reform
city charters this principle is made promi
nentby giving the Mayor the power to
appoint the city boards and officers, and
so making him responsible for the effi
ciency of the city government. Two
Presidents or three with equal powers
would as surely bring disaster as three
generals of equal rank over a single army.
I do not doubt that this sense of single and
personal responsiDility to the people â¢ has
strongly held â¢ our Presidents to a good
conscience and to a high discharge of their
great duties.'' . * 8
FIGHTING THE COMBINE
Traffic Association's Compara
tive Tables of Freight
Rates.
How San Francisco's Commercial Pros
it perity May Be Upheld by
. Competition. , . .
The Traffic Association of California,
through its manager, William B. Curtio,
has issued an interesting comparison of
tariffs on freight between San Francisco
and points in Oregon via the Southern
Pacific all rail route and the North Pacific
Steamship Company's line via Portland,
The comparison of figures is prefaced with
an explanatory letter, which speaks, of a
combine and injustice toward shippers of
San Francisco, as follows
The trade of San Francisco has for some time
felt that it was handicapped in Oregon and
Washington owing to the competition of Port
land, Or. , or Seattle and Tacoma, Wash., in
those fields, and to an adjustment of freight
rates from San Francisco in comparison with
rates from the above-named points not con
sistent with our position; i. c., the difference
between rates say from Portland, Or., to inte
rior Oregon and Washington, and from San
Francisco to the same points has been Â«o great
as to almost stifle competition from this City,
or at least made it next to impossible for a San
Francisco merchant to do business there at a '
profit. j__ lilll|J'''UillH|]llMlill
This rate adjustment is brought about by
agreement between the Oregon Railway and \
Navigation Company, Northern Pacific Rail
road, Southern Pacific Company, Great North
ern Railroad and the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company.
Some members of this combine may or may
not be willing signers, but are swayed by the
majority. "
Therefore, the best interests of San Fran
cisco trade -â  demand that some step be taken
to strengthen its position in the . territory
mentioned, and in accordance we should lend
support to the line or lines that will extend to
us a helping hand. -.
Tne North Pacific Steamship Company,
owning and operating the steamers Alice
Blanchard and Empire, do not take freight
southbound from Portland .to way ports at
less than $3 per ton.
On the other hand we do not expect or be
lieve that any line can long continue. to exist
at a rate of $1 per ton . from San Francisco to
Portland, yet when it comes to a point where
the lines again agree to and do advance rates
we should aim to be in position to say that
rates shall not advance beyond, a reasonable
figure, and to that end the support given to
the Alice Blanchard and Empire will work.
The following comparisons are given for
the more important towns in Oregon,
Washington and Idaho, of rates from San
Francisco:

TSO KWAN, KITCHEN GOD
Jubilee of the Little Chinese
Deity of the House
Stove.
PLACATING A PAUL PRY.
Celestials Are Now Settling Accounts
in Preparation for the Advent of
Their New Year.
. Chinese new year is approaching, and
during the last week of the old year some
interesting ceremonies take place.
Chief of these is the festival of the
"kitchen god," Tso Kwan, just now in
progress in every Pagan Chinese family.
This Tittle god presides over the culinary
department in every Chinese home, and
upon his good will the health and welfare
of th<Â» family throughout the year depend.
Not only does he prevent any deleterious
matter getting into the pot, but he is be
lieved to spy into the doings of the family
during the year, laying tho results of his
investigations before his superior, Yuk
Wong, or the Pearly Emperor.
This is the 24th day of the Chinese
month, and to-night Tso Kwan is said to
start on his journey to make report to Yuk
Wong, whose throne is in the far-off blue.
Dr. Johnson said that a man's life should
not be written by his butler. He knows
too much, and may tell unpleasant things.
It is policy to be on good terms with - Tso
Kwan before he makes his report. Tso
Kwan, like the local policeman, knows too
much, and must be fixed before going up
topside.
Accordingly, Tso Kwan is to-day pro
pitiated with fruits, meats, cakes and
wine. His picture is placed upon the
table and the family gather round, pros
trating themselves and chin-chining him
amid salvoes of exploding firecrackers.
Great quantities of sweetmeats of tha
stickiest kind are supplied him, the effect
of which is that by the time he reaches
the clouds his lips are glued too tight to
gether to make any report to his superior.
In some families a paper horse is pro
vided to carry the god up to. the clouds.
After the sacrifice is over the paper image,
the horse and quantities of paper money
to cover the expenses of the journey aro
burnt and the god is supposed to go up in
the smoke. After this send-off Tso Kwan
is supposed to say pleasant things, but if
there is any crime that the kitchen god
feels bound to report the candies can be
used to make him dumb.
On. the last night ot the year Tso Kwan
returns and is regaled with another feast.
A new image is set up in the vacant shrine
and Tso Kwan resumes his duties. "... ...
Tho Chinese are just now busy settling
accounts. Celestial as well as earthly
creditors are clamoring, and old scores
have to be wiped off before the new year
begins. Bills are being collected at the
stores and vows paid at the temples every
day this week.
This is Chinatown's washing week for
the whole year. The stores are being
scoured and twelve months' cobwebs, dust
and litter removed. Firecrackers have to

lar. 7 â¢
Senator Hale of Maine has rather thin
hair, which he carefully parts in the mid

silk.
John Sherman, although a deep thinker,
has a luxurious mass of iron-gray locks
that he combs back from his forehead.
David B. Hill looks to be the baldest
man in the Senate, as the small amount of
hair he has is jet black, making a striking
contrast with his shining scalp.
Senator Shoup of Idaho is entirely bald,
or what hair is left is so light in color and
so sparsely scattered that it is not to be
seen.â New York Mail and Express.

Are Rice-Eaters Not Bloodthirsty?
It may be admitted that diet has more
or less influence upon character; but mild
ness, gentleness and kindred virtues are
by.no means universally founa among
those races which abstain from animal
food. Vegetarians are prone to contrast
the gentleness of our domesticated herbiv
ora with the ferocity often displayed by
carnivorous animals. A little' reflection,
however, shows that the food cannot
be the main cause of the disposi
tion in either case. Many of the
herbivora are capable of displaying the
utmost ferocity; savage attacks upon inof
fensive persons by bulls, horses, and stags
are by no means uncommon in this coun
try, while in the East "rogue" elephants,
wild boars and other herbivorous animals
often inflict serious injuries upon human
beings who chance to come in their way.
So, likewise, the ordinarily mild Hindu,
feeding on rice or wheat flour, is liable to
become riotous, uncontrollable and blood
thirsty when influenced by religious fan
aticism. It would seem that the mis
chievous effects upon the habits and dis
position, ascribed to animal food, are due
rather to the alcoholic liquors which are
generally consumed at the same time.
The disposition of an average individual
leading a temperate life would probably
not be altered for the better were he to sub
stitute vegetarian diet for his ordinary fare.

HOW DON LUIS
LOST HIS BRIDE.
She Disappeared While He
Was Lighting His
Cigar,
THE GROOM'S MAD HUNT
Troubles of a Dashing Rural
Swain in Getting the
Knot Tied. â¢
THE MAMMA INTERFERED.
.
Justice of the Peace Groezinger Has
a Most Exciting and Novel
Experience.
Justice of the Teace Groezinger went
through more excitement and experience
while trying to marry a couple on Tues
day evening than usually falls to the lights
of the Justices' bench in a whole year of
office. He is yet trying to solve certain be
wildering mysteries connected with the
episode, but is certain that he finally tied
the legal knot that made stalwart Don
Luis Ã. Espejoand pretty Ramona Weeks
one.
He was about to close up his chambers
on the evening mentioned when a messen
ger arrived with a note asKing him to wait
until 6:30, as a couple desiring to be mar
.. ried would call on him at that time. The
: Judge was due at a Masonic banquet at
7:30 and demurred about waiting, but the
messenger, with the keenness of his kind,
; said:
"Better wait, Jedge. They are swells all
-Tight, and you won't lose anything."
The prospect of officiating at the wed
ding of notables. decided the Justice and .
he lingered in his chambers.
Shortly after 0 o'clock a breathless man,
clad in fashionable raiment and wearing a
chining silk tile, rushed into the office and
gazed wildly about the room. Justice
Groezinger was about to ask for the bride,
When his visitor burst out with :
"Isn't she here? Then I have lost her!
Thunder! what shall I do?"
His Honor succeeded in calming tbÂ«^
man down after a moment and obtained
his tale of woe.
He stated that his name was Luis 15.
Ksj>ejo, and that he and his prospective
bride, Miss Kamona Weeks, lived in a
large interior town, the name of which he
declined to divulge. He had long desired
to marry Miss Kamona, but her mother,
who is wealthy, was opposed to the match.
Some time ago lie came to San Francisco
and obtained a license, hoping that some
time he would be able to use it.
Finally the opportunity came when he
persuaded his charmer and her mother to
accompany him to San Francisco on a
pleasure jaunt. They went to stop with
friends, and on Tuesday the young people
called on friends at the Palace, having
made up their minds to slip out to the
new City Hall and have the knot tied be
fore mamma could interfere. All went
well until they left the Palace Hotel after
sending the messenger to the Justice.
The prospective husband stepped into a
cigar-store to get a weed and Miss
Weeks walked along admiring the articles
in the shop windows. Somehow, through
their lack of familiarity with the streets
and the bustle and roar of Market street
at going-home time in the evening they
failed to meet again when the cigar
was well alight, and within a few moments
Espejo was on the run to the hall in the
hope that his fiancee had preceded him
there. He was almost frantic with fear,
and his state of mind was not improved
when he discovered that Miss Weeks' pass
keys and purse were in his overcoat pocket.
Then he thought of her wandering about
the unfamiliar streets and tore his hair.
Finally the suspense became too great
and he called a hack, and, hurrying into
It with the Justice, started to search for
his missing bride,
Down Market street they drove, scan
ning the faces of the ladies on the pave
ment, but no Kamona. She had not re
turned to the Palace and the young man
became more distracted. They were driv
ing back up Market street and when oppo
site Market street Espejo suddenly emitted
a shout of delight, and crying "There she
Is," sprang out of the door before the hack
could halt.
Justice Groezinger saw him rush up to a
handsome young girl who was talking to a
policeman. The guardian of the peace was
pointing in the direction of the Palace.
Miss Weeks was soon in the carriage and
it was decided to return to the Palace and
have the ceremony performed there.
While driving, back Espejo explained to
Justice Groezinger that his fiancee's
mother was opposed to the match, and
begged him. should she appear on the
_cene before the binding words were
spoken, to act a part and pretend to be
merely a friend and a member of the call
ing party.
As soon as possible the friends at the
hotel were persuaded to act as witnesses
and the entire party repaired to the parlors
of the caravansary.
Mr. Espejo and Miss Weeks stood up in
the regular way and with the license in
his hand the Justice went through the
ceremony.
â¢ The customary questions were asked and

answered and the Justice proceeded -. : "By
virtue of the authority vested in me I now
pronounce youâ â " He stopped there,
for the look of consternation on the bride's
face paralyzed his tongue for the moment.
Then to his astonishment the bride and
groom began talking on some C. trivial
subject and the witnesses crowded around
took part in the conversation. He turned
and saw an elegantly elderly dressed lady
entering the parlor.
As she approached the group the Justice
caught the cue, and stuffing the license
hastily into his pocket aud joined the
party," while the bride, with admirable
composure, greeted the newcomer â¢as
"mamma, dear," and kissed her affection
ately. '
"Mamma, dear," evidently did not sus
pect the trick that was being played, and
accepted an invitation to go to the friend's
rooms, leaving the young couple, the
Justice and two others of the party in the
parlor.
Not wishing to take chances on a second
interruption the bridal party crossed the
bridge that joins the Palace and Grand,
and in a parlor oi the latter hotel were
finally made man and wife, the 'Justice
not- forgetting bis prerogative of kissing
the bride. <
Then the newly wedded couple went
laughing but penitent back to the Palace:
to break the news to mamma, get her for
giveness and prepare for the honeymoon
journey to the East, which was begun last
evening. Justice Groezinger promised to
keep the facts of the romantic marriage,
so difficult of accomplishment, secret, but
admitted them when told that one of the

bride's friends had told the storyâ strictly
in confidence, of course. That is how The
Call got the story.
NEW BICYCLE TRACK.
Proposition to Construct One in the Old j
Schuetzen Grounds, Alameda. -
The proposition of ; a bicycle track in
Alameda has again been : revived, and ;it
seems this time as ' though there â¢is some
probability ,of the, wheelmen getting a
track near this City. A company is about
to be incorporated with a capital sufficient
to carry the thing through, and the idea is
to build, for the present, a threes-lap 'dirt
track in "the old Schuetzen Park grounds
in Alameda, with all the" necessary train
ing quarters, grand-stands and the like.
If, after a time, the track is found satisfac
tory, if the curves are safe arid the stretches
long enough, and if the track is -. properly
supported by the clubs and dealers, it will
then be rebuilt of cement,- with such
changes as may suggest themselves, and
the wheelmen will then have one of the
finest racing courses in the United States.
The promoters of the enterprise are C. A.
Adams, F. W." Fuller. 0. J. Leigh ton, G. H.
Stratum and O. F. McGlynn of the Olym
pic Club Wheelman and V. A. Dodd,;J. : F.
Ives, J. G. Stubbs, F. W. Hoyt anil . JI.- F.
Games of the Alameda Cyclers. Frank I).
Elwell has been employed to submit plans
of the track and grounds/and the work of
construction will at once be pushed ahead,'
so as to insure completion in time for the
various spring meets which are to be held
in this part of the State.
As is well known to the wheelmen, Ala
meda is particularly favorably located for
a racetrack. The climate is equable, and
the absence of fogs and high winds make
it quite possible for record work to be
done if a proper track was built. The gen
tlemen mentioned investigated the possi
bilities of having a track on this side of
the bay, at Sixteenth and Folsom streets,
Ingleside and even San Mateo, but none
appeared to them so favorable as the Ala
meda site. -
The articles of "incorporation will be
filed in a few days, and \ then the work of
construction will at once be . begun. : The
promoters expect to receive, some assist
ance financially from the large dealers of.
this City, asthe track will redound largely
to their benefit in encouraging racing and
promoting the sport. They do not expect
to make any money out of it, but feel that
it is necessary, that there should be train
ing grounds and a place to hold an occa
sional bicycle meet in < this vicinity, : and
to that" end have -been 'prompted to take
the matter up. They are all active wheel
men, and under their guidance the propo
sition should succeed. ; 7

FOR COMMIE'S NEWSBOYS
She Gives Them a Performance

California..
HAS A FONDNESS FOR THEM.
Each Youngster Will Receive Her
Portrait Inscribed With Her
- Genuine Autograph.
Corinne, the pride of the Kimball Comic
Opera Company, continues to spread hap
piness among her newsboy friends and to
morrow â¢ night, at the invitation of ' The
Call and through the courtesy of the little
woman, the "kids" will witness her per
formance of Hendrick Hudson* Jr. from
the gallery of the California Theater.
Corinne has not forgotten the fact that
she began her career before the American
public by taking the laurels in a prize
baby show in Boston. Since that time she
has always had a good deal of respect for
youngsters, and the newsboys of America
count her among their friends.
"They like me," said Corinne last night
in the parlor of , the California Hotel,
"simply because I like them. In a word,
we are fond of each otner. I have seen'
the little fellows in all stages of their
existence; I have watched ; the familiar
faces I know among them change and take
on the aspect of manly advancement; I
have seen them pass out of the occupation
that enables them to look upon the world
with keenness and intelligence and rise
steadily in the walks of life that only real
men can treadâ and I am not so old,
either. The fact is, they become adults
very rapidly through the necessity that
compels them to grapple with the world
and push to the front. * They are the lions
of the street gamins, and represent the
beginning of c : what makes good citizens
and eminent Americans.

gave a 'newsboy, night' they all chipped in
and bought a magnificent bouquet of flow

hand side of the gallery right on the stage,
fearing to trust it with the usher. This
testimonial â¢; was one of the most satisfac
tory I have ever received in America, and

;ON BRITISH } ;â  RAILWAYS.
Travel In Carriages of the Different
. ' Classes.
On the Cambrian line it appears that all
the passenger traffic, except 2.3 per cent
that is, 97.7 per centâ by third-class car
riages, and on the Hull and Barnsley
actually 99 per cent of the whole traffic is
third class, leaving only one in every hun
dred travelers i who goes first class. In
fact the , company supplies first-class ac
commodation by every train, . and on an
average carries only one first-class pas
senger by every other train. Clearly on
such a line as that it cannot pay to have
first-class carriages at all. Yet there are'
very curious varieties in the local taste for
differences of grade in various parts of the
country.
In Scotland, where there: are no second
class carriages, a great number of people
dislike traveling third. And as a result
four millions in every" eighty millions, or
one in every twenty passengers, travel first
class, and very often numbers of,; the low
est section of the trading class are found
traveling first. In Ireland, 'again, where
there is a very wide preference for distinc
tions of grade, no less than about a quarter
of the whole passenger traffic is cither first
or second class, : and - only about three
quarters go third; the" exact J proportion
be j_fe r that r out of 24,500,000 passengers
l,5fl|,000 ; go first â .= and p 4,225,000 â  . second.
Again; on ; ai. purely urban '-: line like the
North London," Oniy 60 per cent go \ third
