Hughes.
PROMPT ACTION TAKEN.
Soldiers Hastened to the Front

Surprise.
BUT ART ONLY LAUGHS.
He and His Followers Are Still Confi
dent That They Will Carry
the Day.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Feb. Major R.
Allyn Lewis, commanding the Second
Battalion N. G. A., wires from Bowie that
tie has positive information that the
Maher-Fitzsimanons right is to be brought
off to-morrow within Arizona lines.
This morning Governor Hughes, under
authority of the provisions of the militia
act of 1895, ordered to Eastern Arizona
three companies of militia, two from
Tucson and one from Yuma.
They will be held at Bowie or San
Simon, where commissary positions are
available. Companies at Nogales, Phoenix,
Tempe and Mesa were also ' instructed to
prepare for active service at once. Each
company must report twenty-five men
ready for active duty.
The Governor has telegraphed Major
Lewis to prevent at all hazards the pass
age of persons to engage in a prize-fight,
as they will be implicated in a conspiracy
to commit a felony.
This evening the Governor wired the
Southern Pacific Company that he is in
formed an attempt will be made to bring
off the : fight , in Arizona, and urging that
company not to become accessories by
carrying the fighters.' '
Allen, who gives the information about
the fight, was sent by Governor Hughes
as a detective. .
All these preparations do not distract
the sports in the least. ' They are still cou
fluent and continue to declare that the
fight will come off. " Gus" Hirschfeld main
tains that he is willing to place $10,000
against half that amount as a backer of his
opinion.
TROOPS ORDERED TO SHOOT.
Governor Ahumada Will Resist the
Threatened Invasion. â â  .
EL PASO, Tex., Feb. 12.â The situation
thirty-six hours before tbe time orieinally
set for the appearance of Fitzsimmons ana
Maher in the ring is in nearly every re
spect the counterpart of the conditions
that immediately preceded the meeting of
Sullivan and Kilrain at Ritchburg in July
of 1888. â â ' â  â 
The Texas and Federal authorities
and those of . the adjoining Mexican
State are apparently determined to prevent
the mill, as were the executives of Louis
iana and MississiDpi seven . years ago. By
the same token, the active promoters of
the contest are just as cool and collected
and going ahead with their arrangements
with as much energy as did Bud Renaud
" and his associates at New Orleans.
There is no question but that they have
carefully laid their plans and that they are
confident of their ability to bring off the
big fight at ieast^gfiffigS^
,The battleground has been finally se
lected. The arrangements for transporta
tion are effected, and every detail, includ
ing the hour at which the tip is to be given
to the j ticket-holders to rendezvous, has
been carefully planned, to the end that
the powers that be of the locality selected
may be outwitted. To the remaining
events of the. carnival everything depends
upon the Outcome of Friday's venture. The
fight managers admit that it will hardly be
possible- to/ bring off two contests at the
same spot, and their ability to find safe
locations is seriously doubted.
There is talk to-night that an effortjwill'
toe made to pull off the Everhardt- Leeds
contest arid that ' the others will ; be aban
doned, but this the managers neither deny
nor affim. Their coolness and assurance
concerning the , big fight, however, has
given renewed confidence to local people
and visitine sports, and bets are . freely
offered to-night, with no takers, that, the
Australian and Irishman will come to
gether on sbedule time.
Meanwhile Governor Ahumada, with his
headquarters at Juarez, is keeping in close
touch with the situation. A detachment
of the;national cavalry, twenty-five strong,
arrived from Chihuahua during the morn
ing and is quartered at the Juarez bar
racks, where there is also a company of
fifty infantrymen. There are no rurales
on the border or within a distance of two
hundred miles, and the Governor is em
phatic â¢in " his ' statements that none are
needed and that none will be brought on.
To Judge Crosby of : this city, who vis
ited him to-day to make a 'final effort
toward inducing him" to withhold inter
ference, Governor Ahumada â¢ said that he
was' satisfied ..that even with the small
force at his command he could prevent an
Invasion of Mexican soil â¢ at ; any point.
Later in the day the Governor was even
more emphatic. V
"This fight must not take place in
Mexico," be said, "and if its promoters
come onto our side of the line our soldiers
will have orders to shoot without discrim
ination between combatants or non-com
batants. Principals or spectators, every
body has been s given fair warning, and if
they disregard it, then it will be at their
own peril." ".-';''?'
From his headquarters in ' the Federal
building Adjutant-General Mabry is also
watching the movements "of the managers
Â»nd receiving reports from Captain Me*! ',
The San Francisco Call.
Donald, whose forty trusty Rangers are
mixing with, the crowds at the numerous
headquarters and gathering in for their
superiors all the floating rumors and gos
sip. General ; Mabry expresses himself , as
satistied that there is no intention to bring
off the fights in this State, but yet he does
not intend to relax his vigilance. ,",
. A number of the Rangers went out to the
.yards and sidetracks of the different roads,
this afternoon with a view of (spotting the
cars in which the lrinetoscope, platform
and other paraphernalia of the ring have
been loaded, and then keeping track of
them by numbers, as they may be shifted
about the yards.
Whatever information in this line may
be obtained, the adjutant-general will
communicate as a matter of . courtesy to
New Mexican and Mexican authorities.
Information reached The United Press
to-night from Fort Bliss that orders had
been received from Washington counter
manding, until further notice, the fifteen
days' practice march upon which Com
pany H of the Fifteenth Infantry should
have started to-morrow, and also ordering
that the troops be confined to barracks to
morrow. Company B has just returned
from its fifteen days' march, and the offi
cers and men of Company H had every
thing in readiness for the start to-morrow.
The orders, which came via the depart
ment headquarters at San Antonio are
interpreted at the fort as indicating that
the troops will be ordered out in the event
of indications pointing to tHe selection of
New Mexican ground for a battlefield.
There are at Fort Bliss two companies of
the .Fifteenth Infantry, 150 men, and a
troop of fifty of the Fifth Cavalry.
Fitzsimmons. and Julian were in town
for several hours to-day. Both sat around
the headquarters uncommunicative and
inclined to be morose. The Australian,
who to all appearance is in first-class con
dition, quit exercise to-night, and will
take things easy to-morrow. He has all
of Stuart's confidence that the Hot Springs
fiasco will not be repeated, and expressed
himself as satisfied that he could make
short work of his opponent. '-.;* >
Maher, Marshall and the rest of the
crowd at Las Cruces will come down to
morrow. Ross of Colorado, who is looking
after Marshall near Maher's quarters, said
this afternoon that the Irishman was in
prime condition, and that there was no
Dasis for the reports of his overtraining.
A large number of dispatches from
abroad were read at 7 headquarters to-day,
but it was given out that the 'majority re
lated to the abandonment of excursions
from various points in States west of the
Alleghanies as a result of the action of
Congress. â¢ One of the managers frankly
confesses that he will be terribly surprised
if there are over 500 spectators at the ring
side. V*-i\^ii,~i-i*i â  ' : â¢

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. , 12. -The
United /Press is able to-night to announce
positively that Senator Quay of Pennsyl

go before the Republican ; National Con
vention at St.' Louis. The Senator is now
"in the hands of his friends," and his

pend upon their ' efforts. ',- It is understood
that the Senator has full knowledge of the
statement thus made public.
For several days Quay has been besieged
by his friends and the members of the
delegation from his State to permit them
to announce him .as their â¢ candidate, but
thus far he has declined to give his con
sent. After considering the matter care
fully, that consent was given this evening,
and Mr. Quay's personal friends and lieu-,

less notified of the facts at once. _ Mr. Quay
himself declined to-night to be interviewed.

WHO WORE THE YOKE?

Its Passage.
CLERK DUCKWORTH'S DENIAL.
Declares That He Was Not Responsi
ble for the Loss of the Con
current Resolution.
â¢SACRAMENTO, Cat,., Feb. 12.-The
original draft of Assembly concurrent reso
lution 7, protesting against the Reilly
funding bill, has been discovered. It was
found this morning by Secretary or State
L. H. Brown and Ed McCabe, the Gov
ernor's executive secretary, who have been
making an exhaustive search for the docu
ment ever since the published report of its
loss in The Call.
:â¢ The document was found in the vault
adjoining the apartments at present occu
pied by the Bureau of Highways, but for
merly the rooms of the Secretary of State,
and was mingled with a mass of useless,
documents which had been : gathered in
the Assembly chamber after the Legisla
ture adjourned. .The document bears the
signature of 8. J. Duckworth,, chief clerk
of the Assembly, stating that it was
adopted in the Assembly January 30, 1895.
It also has the signature of Secretary
Brandon of the Senate, to the effect that
it passed that body on the 30th of January,
but there is 'nothing; to indicate that it
ever went to - the â¢ engrossing clerk or
reached the hands of .the Governor, and
instead of being printed it is written. The
bill, after reciting the purpose for which
it was formulated, goes on to recite :
We are unalterably opposed to any and all
extensions of the payment of said debt (that of
the Pacific railroads) arid to the Reilly funding
bill, and to any other bill 'of like '; import, arid
we hereby request our Representatives in Con
gress and instruct our Senators to use all hon
orable means to defeat said funding bill or any
similar measure; and be It further
Resolved, That 'we ', demand the : immediate
collection on maturity of said debts from the*
said railroad ; company and , the i stockholders
thereof, and hereby call upon tne Federal Gov
ernment to exhaust every endeavor to ' recover i
the legal and * equitable assets of said roads
wherever such ; assets may be found, whether
the : same be in the possession of private indi
viduals or in the possession of incorporated or
other estates of | deceased stockholders in said
roads, or whether the same be In the possession
of corporations, either railroad or otherwise;
provided , however, /' that i nothing contained j
herein shall be construed as a legislative decla
ration of a waiver of : rights under State : laws
upon i; the j subject of : ' shareholders' â  liability;
and in the event that said debt cannot be col
lected then .that the United States Government
assume , control,"' ownership operation of
said roads, and we hereby memorialize Con
gress to this effect;; and be it further ' '.' V"
V J Resolved^: That â¢ the ; Governor be .arid, he l is
hereby requested to transmit by telegraph' a
copy of these resolutions to each of our Repre
sentatives and Senators in Congress. i :â â¢-â¢; ','/
' But, unfortunately, ' the resolution never
reached the Governor's bands. It would
appear that . considerable of th 9 blame
must rest on Chief Clerk Duckworth, as
the document is indorsed by that gentle
man as having been received by him : on
the 30th of January; 1895. He was ordered
to transmit it to the Governor immediately,
which he failed to do. This is ' more con
clusively proved -by the fact that Mr.
Duckworth's receipt-book . shows that he
did not take it to the executive, there being
receipts for all resolutions passed but this
one. ; â â¢-./. ... ... . ""^\.S- : \. '/"'.''; -". ""''
The enrolling â * clerk, whose . duty it was
to transmit to the Governor a 1! bills and
* resolutions which had passed the Legisla
ture, has no ,; record in his" f stubbook to
show, that any receipt .had ever been given
by him to Mr. Duckworth for the resolu
tionâsomething j which | the latter always
required before any bill or resolution passed
by the Legislature was - allowed to -. pass
from his possession. - ; â¢"â 'â¢.
Old employes of â¢â  the - State, conversant
with inside history of past sessions, seem
inclined ;to believe ' that the "| resolution
may have been/mixed up in a mass of
other documents, 1 lost sight of .'and forgot
ten, but it hardly ; appears plausible that
such an important ( document, supposedly
bearing great weight with \ Congress and
rushed through both' houses on g the same
day, should so easily have sunk into obliv
ion. â¢\' ; r^,iv : -s..vr : Jv'.ly',^^:S'.- ,\ "/-'â¢
Deputy Controller Douglass, states -that
in his opinion concurrent resolution No.
7 was never telegraphed to Congress at all.
He has made a thorough search of the an
nals of his office and | cannot ; find that
Chief Clerk Duckworth or any other per
son ever made any demand for telegraph
rates for this purpose. In his opinion it
was news of the former resolutions of a
like nature which - reached â¢ Washington,
and not the document which was passed
by both houses. ;;* '/ '';/'/''

i which consists of calling the ' roll, reading

SENATOR CTTLLOM'S JOKER.
A Resolution Which Has Aroused
the Suspicions of Congressman
Maguire. .
i WASHINGTON,- D. C., Feb. 12.-The
story printed in -Monday's Call, to the
effect that the Union Pacific and' Central
Pacific people t were unable '. to agree upon
the terms of a bill to settle or extend their
Government debt, has created the liveliest
interest lin ] New York City and Washing
ton, the story having been wired to New
York from San Francisco.
. l Judge Maguire says . there is no doubt
but that the Vanderbilts and Goulds and
other Chicago and '. Northwestern stock
holders are anxious to buy the Union Pa
cific and Central Pacific, as this would give
them ; (with the ; New "! York Central) a
through line from New York to San Fran
ciscoâsomething they have long sought. -
.1 MaÃUire says he has had ".. a suspicion for
some time that this was to be the scheme,
and his suspicions were strengthened by a
: bill introduced by Senator Thurston of Ne
braska, providing for foreclosure and sale,
and by the questions asked by Senator
Wolcott of Colorado in the committee last
Saturday. â ._,- \; - f y. â¢' ,r
Mr. Huntington finds his game blocked
for the time being, and his lobbyists have
been called off until he has time to gather
his wits and decide; upon . some new plan
of .. campaign. He ; realizes ,he ; < cannot
make a fight successfully for refunding
single-handed, and that if the Vanderbilt,
Gould and Chicago and Northwester inter
ests oppose his funding \ scheme it , : will be
an almost hopeless fight. ( .
Judge Maguire says he concluded, after
hearing Counsel Pierce' of : the .. Union J Pa-:
cific reorganization committee against the
Smith" funding that â¢ the â¢ Union and
Central ; Pacific i would ,not pull together, â 
but that Vanderbilts and Goulds were
behind that opposition. He says the ' ; lat
ter could afford to pay for the Union and
Central Pacific (at foreclosure v sale)' twice
as much Sas it would cost ;. to build "a new
road from Omaha to San Francisco.
;i! Senator Cullom of Illinois to-day intro
duced a resolution to foreclose on the 'Pa-;
cific roads. V* It directs the ; Secretary of the
Treasury to close up : the sinking-fund ' ac
count of Â» the i Central " Pacific and Union
Pacific roads arid report the necessary ap
propriations, if any, to balance the ac
count, the amount of balance to be placed
to the credit of lawful arid' just claimants,
known and unknown. Mr. Cullom intro
duced \ his resolution with - the following
preamble: â --'â  / \-'- â¢'â" V'l": " '". * ;
â¢-.Whereas, The obligations of the Union and
. Central Pacific arid other Pacific railroad' com
panies, designated t \by 4 i the < statutes ji' of i : the
: United States as i 01 1 lien indebtedness, prior
and. paramount , to their indebtedness to the
United States, has matured; and, whereas, no
public notice of the maturity.- of sucn indebt
edness has been given to the. public," or !to the
, Congress of the \ United ' States; and,' whereas,
all interest . accrued :â  on the bonds rep
resenting | such ':' paramount : Hen | indebted
ness for the purpose of a sinking fund have
by f the terms of the statute under .which
they were issued also matured; and, whereas,
without the lawful notice of maturity
in respect thereof' being given, such indebted
ness must continue to increase at the rate of
5 per cent on sinking-fund securities and of . 6
per cent on ; original \ bonds :so secured by
sinking fund: and, whereas, by reason of the
premises, as well as for older causes of public
good and justice, the powers provided | and re
served to Congress in acts of 1862, 1864 : and
1878 (sections 7 and 8) and of March 3, 1887
(sections 4 and 5), are adequate to the protec
tion by Congressional legislation of the .joint
interests of the United States and all lawful
and just creditors, as expressed in said sections
7 and 8 ;
Resolved, Etc.
'Appended to the resolutions is a brief
respecting Pacific railroads, ; which states
that all Congressional legislation upon
bond-aided railroads, from the beginning,
reserves the right for further legislation.
Hence the early acts were merged by those
of later dates. ..uV;'^ fet'^^'V'.-*"
Judge Maguire said to a Call corres
pondent to-night: "Senator Cullom's reso
lution, on its face, seems to hasten' the
foreclosure of the Government lien of the
Pacific railroads, but the provision for ap
plying the sinking fund to the payment of
paramount liens, superior to the Govern
ment lien, has a sinister look to me. It
seems tome one of the -purposes of the
resolution, if not the only purpose, is to
acknowledge by resolution the priority of
the so-called first mortgage. : ".
"The Secretary ..of the Treasury had
refused to apply, the sinking : fund to the
payment of overdue first mortgage install
ments. The Collum resolution, if passed,
would probably override the Secretary's
decision and action in this matter and
might be held to be a complete abandon
ment of the Governments claim to priority.
"At any rate, I see no necessity for the
passage of any such â¢ resolution at this
time, and I am, - therefore, opposed to j
the resolution." '-, - ; ?}' [ .y t-v/ â¢;-":
THE KENTUCKY FIGHT.
Vote* for Repeal Gained Through the
Senatorial Contest.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 12.â Few peo
ple, even here in Frankfort and interested
in the contest, have any idea of how much
influence the fight against the Goebel re
peal bill is exciting in the Senatorial fight;
but it is very evident to one not interested
in that contest : especially and â¢ who is
watching the work against the other, to
see. that the opponents of the bill are
making use of every point to help their
cause. , â¢â . . ..'"'\- J \ : ''".' 'â >.'- '" .. â .
General Basil W. Duke, with â¢ abie as
sistants, is looking after the Democratic
side -of â¢ the. House, and St. John Bogle,
with his contingent of Republican' work
ers, after the other. Heretofore the general,
being a life-long Democrat and with a
war record in Morgan's command that
gave -him a strong influence in
every | section of â  . the State, could have
things done pretty much as he liked; but
now the situation is | different, and he is
much hampered by. the : fact that the Re
publicans have a membership equal to
that of his own party, so General Echols
had to send him assistance to handle that
side cf the House, which he did in the per
son of his co-receiver on the C; O. and S.
W. R. R.â St. John Boyle., Mr. Boyle has
always, been a Republican,- stands well
with bis party, and has a j great deal of
personal influence.
y General Duke has heretofore always
taken an active part in the Senatorial con
tests,, which have been practically decided
in the Democratic caucus; but this time,
while apparently interested in that fight,
he and his assistants are working up the
opposition to that repeal billâ first, last
and all the time. So with St, John Boyle
and his helpers on the other side of the
House. ;i",W.' " '
In the Senate they no longer. expect to
do more than delay matters until they get
things fixed in the Hquse. With Goebel,
Fulton and". Sims among the Democrats
and i Landes, Lyons, Deboe and Jones of.
the 'Republicans making a - fight for the
bill, the efforts of Wessinger, Hays and
Bennett against it will be of little avail, ex
cept in making delay. They hope for
better luck in the House, and are fixing
for a strong fight there from start to finish.
The first effort will be to have it buried in
the committee until theJast moment and
then delay its passage; until the time for
adjournment comes. They may be suc
cessful in this, but it is doubtful, and de
pendent in a large measure on the course
and result of the Senatorial fight.
The campaign -of education as .to the
enormities perpetrated on the people of
the Pacific Coast under this charter is
having its effect. The matter is being read
with* interest and a; strong sentiment in
favor of '. the , repeal is growing among the
members of ," the House. Huntington is
doing all he can to counteract this in the
shape of personal letters and appeals from
various parties along the lines of his roads.
Colonel Breckinridge has not put in an
appearance yet to lead '.-â¢ Huntington's
forces : against the , bill, and even when he
does come he can do 'â  but ; little additional
harm. i The fact that he is fighting the
bill ; will be l sufficient evidence that he. is
doing it for a consideration, and 'that will
lessen his influence greatly. It is not
strong as 'is. ' ', : '^i+--~'.
'. Breckinridge has^ieverjforgiven ' Senator
Blackburn for the part he and his wife
took in I the. Pollard- Breckinridge matter,
and he has by y his course toward the
Senator aroused the - ill-feeling ;of the
latter's friends. . i , ' - . - â 
Goebel arid repeal seem to be favored by
Providence at this time. Huntington's
managers are not so blind that they do
riot see this. â¢' They, do not wear the look
of jubilant joy 'of victory assured;; but are
quietly attending \to business. They well
know, that : barring .those . directly in
terested and under the control of Mr.
Huntington y' the : sentiment of the
Legislature is in favor of "repealing that
charter, but they still hope to â¢ counteract
that and' secure â¢â  the: defeat of the bill in
"some way. How? -
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 12.â The bal
lot for Senator in t the. joint Assembly was

ERROR IN THE TREATY.
The Agreement for a Settlement
of Bering Sea : Claims -i?
"Is Corrected.
Had Ignored the Possible Existence of
Counter-Claims Against Great
Britain.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. Yester
day afternoon in , executive session the
treaty, between this Government and
Great Britain for the settlement of the
claims growing out of the alleged Bering
Sea seal fisheries seizures was laid before
the Senate and referred to the Committee
on Foreign Relatioris.
The convention ' was ; considered by the
committee but no conclusion was reached,
the time being consumed by Senator Mor
gan, who made an elaborate speech, to the
committee of his views on the subject arid
its relation to the finding of the court of
arbitration held in Paris.
The convention is signed : . on behalf of
the United States by ; Secretary of State
Olney ' and on behalf of Great Britain by
Embassador Pauncefote.
It provides for the appointment of one
commissioner by each Government. If
these two cannot reach a conclusion then
an umpire, or third commissioner, is to be
selected. . If the two Governments cannot
agree upon this umpire the convention
stipulates that he shall be named by the
President of the Swiss Republic.
Whatever may be agreed ito by these
Commissioners is to be binding upon the
two Governments parties to the treaty. ; .
The text of the convention is unsatisfac
tory to the. committee in one particular,
and was amended.
It provides for the finding of claims of
the subjects of . Great Britain against the
United States for illegal seizing and
ignores the - possible existence of any
claims by citizens of the'Uhited States
against the Dominion of Canada or Great
Britain. The amendment will correct this '
oversight.
This treaty is the outgrowth of the find
ing of the Paris tribunal.
- That h igh court of arbitration refused to
consider the question of damages, but left
that to the future â  determination of the
two governments. . Great ':- Britain subse
quently claimed a specific amount, and en
executive communication to the last Con
gress urged the j appropriation of a lump
sum of $425,000 to pay these claims.
-â '. The Senate, however, chiefly through the
influence of Senator '; Morgan, refused â¢' to
allow the appropriation, his contention
being that the subject of such a bill was
equivalent to the admission that the Paris
award .. had included the subject of dam
ages. It was then held that the only way
the question of damages could be settled
was by a separate investigation.
The legality of the claims then presented
to this Government was denied. : The con
vention brings the matter before the Sen
ate in what is held by the committee to be
the only proper manner, and it is said
there will he but little delay in making a
report to the Senate in favor of : the treaty
after it has been so amended as to protect
the rights of \ the United States equally
with those of Great Britain.

Virtues of the Great. Liberator,
Extolled in Patriotic
Speeches.
DEPEWS ELOQUENT PEAISE.
Principles Enunciated by the Dead
Statesman Form the Basis of .
Republicanism.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 12.â Mingled with
homage to the great emancipator, Abra
ham Lincoln, on the occasion of his eighty
seventh birthday anniversary, was a great
Republican greeting to-night to the Re
publican leader from Ohio, William Mc-
Kinley, at tbe tenth annual banquet of the
Marquette Club, held in the banquet halls
of the Auditorium Hotel.
More than 1100 prominent Republican
citizens of this and other cities listened to
praises of Lincoln and Republicanism and
made the event a memorable one, polit
ically, by voicing their pent-up admira
tion for the Canton citizen as a Presiden
tial candidate.
Standing beneath a portrait of the mar
tyred President, nankfeel and framed with
the flag he died to preserve, Major
McKinley faced a mass of his fellow Re
publicans to deliver a patriotic eulogy to
the memory of Lincoln, couched in elo
quent and fervid language.
Distinguished Americans in public life
sat to the right and left of the chief ora
tor, whose introduction by President El
den C. Dewitt of the club was made the
signal for an overwhelming outburst of en
thusiasm. While President Dewitt was
delivering a brief address he stopped to
inform the assembly that a crowd of men
was standing on the storm-swept street in
front of the hotel and would not disperse
until Major McKinley spoke to them from
the balcony. ...r.-',.-
Wrapping a coat about him and stand
ing without a hat in . the blustering east
wind from the lake, Ohio's ex-Governor
spoke to 100 men from the Michigan-ave
nue balcony a few words about Lincoln.
After President Dewitt had spoken under
embarrassing difficulties General Arthur
H. Chetlain of Chicago spoke forcibly of
the duty which faced Republican clubs in
the impending contest.
Then William McKinley rose to re
ceive the plaudits of bis fellow-Republi
cans, who listened in unusual silence
while he spoke to the toast, "Abraham
Lincoln."
Mr. McKinley said in part:
It requires the most gracious pages in the
world's history to record what one Americau
achieved. The story of this simple life is the
etory of a plain, honest, manly citizen, true
patriot and profound statesman, who believing
with all the strength of his mighty soul in the
institutions of his country, won because of
them the highest place in its Government
then fell a precious sacrifice to the Union he
held so dear, which Providence had spared his
life long enough to save.
We meet to-night to do honor to this im
mortal hero, Abraham Lincoln, whose achieve
ments have heightened human aspirations and
broadened the field of opportunity to the races
of men. While tb/e party with which we stand
and for which he stood can justly claim him
and without dispute can boast the distinction
of being the first to honor and trust him, his
fame has leaped the bounds of party and Â©pun
try and how belongs to mankind and the ages.
Among the statesmen of America, Lincoln is
the true Democrat, and, Franklin perhaps ex
cepted, the first great one. He had no illus
trious ancestry; no inherited place or wealth,
and none of the prestige, power, training or
culture which were assured to the gentry or
landed classes of our own colonial times.
Yet Lincoln's antecedent life seemed to have
been one of unconscious preparation for the
great responsibilities which were committed
to him in 1860. As a man of the masses him
self and living with them, sharing their feel
ings and sympathizing with their daily trials,
their hopes and aspirations, he was better
fitted to lead them than any other man of his
age. He recognized more clearly than anyone
else that the plain people he met in his daily
life, and knew so familiarly, were, according
to tbe dictates of justice and our theory of
Government, its ultimate rulers and the arbi
ters of its destiny. â¢ '
In the selection of his Cabinet he at once
showed his greatness and magnanimity. His
principal rivals for: the Presidential nomina
tion were i vited to sit in his council cham
ber. No one but a great man, conscious of his
own strength, would have done this.
During the Civil War he was a tower of
strength to the Union. Whether in defeat or
victory he kept right on, dismayed at nothing,
- and never to be diverted from the pathway of
duty. â¢ ,
The crowning glory of Lincoln's administra
tion and the greatest executive act in Ameri
can history was his immortal proclamation of
emancipation.
Mr.President.it is not difficult" to place a,
correct estimate on the character of Lincoln.
He was tne greatest man of his time, especially
approved of God for the work he gave him
to do.
Witnessing the Government as we do to-day,"
with its debt-increasing, -. bond-issuing, gold
* depleting, labor-destroying low tariff . policy,
the words of Lincoln, written more than half a
century ago, come to us in this hour and
emergency. As far back as March 1, 1843, at
a Whig meeting In Springfield, Lincoln offered
a series of resolutions relating to the tariff
which could well be accepted here to-night.
Let me read to you the Lincoln platform on
tariff, adopted on May 17, 1800, by the second
, Republican National Convention. Here Is what
it said:
- Resolved, That while providing revenue for the
support of the general Government by; duties on
imports, sound policy requires auch an adjustment
of these imports as to encourage the development
of the industrial Interests of the whole country:
and .we recommend ; that policy of National ex
changes which secures to the worklngman liberal
wages, to agriculture remunerative prices,, to
mechanics and manufacturers an adequate reward
for their skill, labor and enterprise, and to the
nation commercial prosperity and Independence. .
Better protection no Republican could ask or
desire. The Republican party is competent to
carry this policy into effect. Whenever there
is anything to be done for this country, It is to
the Republican party we must look to have it
v_3ne. We are not contending for any particu
lar ; tariff ; law or â â  laws, or â â  for any â¢ special
schedules or rates, but for the great principleâ
the American protective policyâ the temporary
overflow ; of ; which . has ; brought ' distress and
ruin to every part of our beloved country. ;
Senator Thurston â¢"â  followed the ex-Gov
ernor 6f Ohio, speaking to the toast, "The
Impending'- Contest." His stirring elo
quence on behalf fof â¢ Republican doctrines
was punctuated with rounds of applause,
and when be said that "the glory of . the
McKinley tariff will give victory to the
Republican party" a ' thousand men rose
fro m the seats and, repeated the scene
which followed the presentation of - Mc-
Kinley. -
: Mr. Thurston said in part: ' ' v j: : }
There are so many impending contests just
at present that lam not at all certain as to
which one my toast refers, but whatever the
contest may be, if it Involves the honor or dig
nity or welfare of my country, the maintenance
and , permanency of American institutions or
the prosperity and happiness of the American
people, lam enlisted in it. - :. â  â¢ i'-,\
- I am reminded ; that there is an impending
contest to take place in this city next July.
The contest which takes ! place in ;' the next
Democratic convention will furnish a spectacle
for gods and men. The z Democratic party Is
rent asunder. Half of it is for gold monomet
tallism and the other half is for silver mono
metalism. .;;.
Out - Leinocratic friends console themselves
with the thought that there is the same con
test pending in the Republican party as in
their own, but nothing could be further from
the truth. .The Republican party of this coun
try stands to-day practically united, pledged
to the policy of American bimetallism. â  â¢
But I have an idea that I am expected to
speak to-night of that contest which is not im
pending, but which is now on between protec
tion and free | trade. The great political con
test of 1806 will be fought on the same lines as
have all other recent contests between Demo
cratic and Republican parties. The protection
of American industries., American markets for
American "products, American prices for
American labor, is the battle" cry of the Repub
lican party for the coming Campaign. Two
million idle men in the United States demand
a chance to vote upon this issue in the full
knowledge of bitter experience.
The free coinage of silver must wait for the
free coinage of muscle. The opening of Ameri
can silver mines can wait for the opening of
American manufactories.
Since the Republican party went out of
power there has been a shrinkage of at least
25 per cent In the manufactures of this coun
try. This means a reduction of one-fourth of
the labor forces of the United States and the
withdrawal of one-fourth of the wage money of
the country from daily circulation. The funds
in this country which were formerly used for
investment in agricultural products hay
been diminished in exact proportion to the
shrinkage in the American labor market. The
decrease in American consumption has, of
course, increased the amount of agricultural
products offered to the foreign market, and the
result has been a constantly downward ten
dency in the foreign and American prices.
There are thousands of people who insist
that the tariff question has been settled per
manently; that the Wilson bill will be per
mitted to stand; but the Republican party has
never consented to the settlement of any great
question until it has been settled rightly. The
Republican party will never consent to the
settlement of any great question until every
American factory is reopened; until every
American can find re-employment at a decent
wage; until every American home is once
more filled with the comforts of life.
But, Mr. Toastmaster, the impending con
test between the Democratic and Republican
parties on the issue of protection is not enough
of a contest to dignify the name. There is not
an intelligent American who does not know
and rejoice in the knowledge that the Repub
lican party is coming back into power to re
build the edifice of American prosperity.
Mr. Thurston closed by suggesting as
the proper man for the next President and
leader of the Republican party the Hon.
William McKinley of Ohio.
NEW YORK'S TRIBUTE.
Depewand Foraker Praise the Acts
of Abraham LI ncoln Before the
Republican Club.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 12.â guests
and members of the Republican Club cele
brated to-night the birthday of Abraham
Lincoln with a dinner at Delmonico's.- A
large portrait of the martyred President,
draped with American flags, hung over the
chairman's seat. Covers were laid for 300
diners. "
When the sumptuous menu had been dis
cussed and the coffee and cigars were be
ing looked after, acting Chairman Root
arose, and after brief remarks introduced
Chauncey M. Depew, who was received
with applause. ,
After paying a glowing tribute to the
memory of the martyred President Mr.
Depew, continuing, said:
To-day, for the first time since Lincoln's
death, the 12th of February is a legal holiday
in our State of New York, and it is proper that
the people should, without regard to their
party affiliations, celebrate â¢in a becoming
manner the birth and the achievements of this
savior of the Republic. But it is equally
proper for us who are gathered here as Repub
licans *to celebrate also the deeds and the
achievements and the character of the greatest
Republican -who ever lived. This party to
which we belong, this great organization of
which we are proud, this mighty engine in the
hands of Providence for the accomplishment
of more for the land in which it has worked
than any party in any representative govern
ment ever accomplished before, received its
teachings and inspirations more largely from
the statesmanship and utterances of Abraham
Lincoln than from any other man.
The first speech he ever made was a speech
for that policy which .was the first policy of
George Washington," the first policy of the
greatest creative brain In Revolutionary
periods, Alexander Hamilton, the prin
ciple of the protection of American In
dustries. With that keen and intuitive
grasp of public necessity and of the
future growth of the Republic which always
characterized Lincoln, he saw early in life that
this country, under a proper system of protec
tion, would become" self-supporting; he saw
that a land of raw materials was necessarily a
land of poverty, while a land of diversified-in
dustries, each of them self-sustaining and pros
perous, was a land of colleges and schools; a
land of science ana literature; a land of re
ligion and law; a land of prosperity, happiness
and peace.
Abraham Lincoln was the emancipator of the
slave, and the Republican party from its or
ganization In 1856 down to-day has been the
organized force for larger liberty to the people
of the United States.
Abraham Lincoln -was an American of Amer
icans and believed in America for Americans.
The Republican " party, in .-.' the policy which
fosters business, employment and wages,
which stimulates immigration and the distri
bution of wealth throughout the land, which
encourages the construction of railroads, the
digging of i canals," '_ the opening of mines; the
feunding of States and - the building of cities,
is the party of America for Americans.
. Abraham Lincoln stood, as no other name in
our history stands, for the Union of the States,"
for the preservation of the Republic;; and the
Republican -partyâ his partyâ proudly] boasis
that do member .of It ever fired a shot at the
flag or dia aught against the perpetuity of cur
Union. â¢' \: - . â â :.â â  '
/Abraham Lincoln stood for principles and
measures which could â  be advocated in every
State as the best for that State and for the whole
country; - for ; a policy that could break the

tional divisions and unite ' the ; people of the

stands before the country as the only National
party," with the ; ; Solid South s broken and sec

'Abraham Lincoln would draw the last dollar
the country possessed and draft ' the last man
capable of bearing arms to save ; the Republic.
He would use any currency by which the army
could be kept in the 'field and the navy.; upon
the seas.' : ; When the peril was so great that our
promise to pay only Â± yielded 30 ; cents on the'
dollar he prevented the collapse of our credit
and the ; ruin of our cause by < pledging the
National faith to the payment of our debts and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1896.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN : ALL NATIONS UNITE IN HONORING HIS MEMORY
hail the example, the inspiring example, of
that man of the people, that wisest of rulers, \
that most glorious of Republican*, Abraham
Lincoln! I, . '|.."T;
President Bliss came in just at the close
of Dr. Debew's: speech, and there was a
scene of wild enthusiasm when Mr. Root
resigned the chair to the president.
Mr. Foraker, in responding to the toast
"The Republican Party,". said, in part: ;
So far as the past of the Republican party is
concerned, very little need be said. It speaks
for itself. Suffice it to say it is replete with
glorious achievements; its great deeds and
great men will forever challenge the admira
tion of the world. As the past is full of glory,
60 is the present-resplendent with triumph.
No party ever won such victories as we are now
enjoying. At the hands of those who defeated
us has come our most signal vindication.
Three years of Democratic rule has demon
strated that there is no harmony of opinion
among Democrats. They are hopelessly di
vided upon every great question. The elec
tions of next November will return the Repub
lican party to power, and the 4th of March,
1897, will mark the beginning of the second
era of Republican rule. No man can speak
without qualification of the future, but I take
it for granted that there will" be a revision of
the tariff to tne end that the Government may
have a sufficient revenue -and our industries
and labor sufficient protection.
Mr. Foraker then spoke at length upon
the merchant marine and American navy.
Said he: "â  v
It should be made advantageous to mer
chants to have American-built boats carry
their goods. To this end we should discrimin
ate in tonnage and tariff duties. Had Presi
dent Harrison been re-elected the probabilities
are that something effective would have been
done ere this; but he was not re-elected, and
the tide has relentlessly run against us until
now we carry only about 12 cent of our
foreign trade. It can scarce be said that there
is any longer an American marine.
We must not only recover our merchant ma
rine, but we must have a navy able to protect
it and to command respect for our flag wher
ever it may float. And then, as the fit comple
ment of an American marine and an American
navy, we should; at once build an American
ship canal across Nicaragua.- .
These ' are three - majestic works. They are
worthy of the party that saved the Union and
gave to immortality the great names of Lin
coln and Grant. Their undertaking will be a
fit crowning of the closing century, and their
consummation will bring . wealth, . power,
honor, happiness , and ; v glory to the whole
American people, and so " entrench the Repub
lican party in their affections that neither you
nor I will 'â  live * long enough ', to see another
Democratic President. v

WEDDED TO SAVE EXPENSE.
Man and Wife Remarried Because They
Lost a Pirst Certificate.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 12.â Robert
W. Roberts of Wales and Phoebe Tilson of
Ireland were married in Toronto forty
years ago. They have a grown-up family.
Some time ago their flat up town was
robbed and the. family Bible, with the
record -of the marriage and the marriage
certificate, was carried away. They - tried,
to get a duplicate of the certificate from
the Toronto officials, but were told that it
would cost $50. \ Rather than pay this sum
they decided to get married over again.
So they were wed at the City Hall yes- ;
terday, Alderman Parker performing the
ceremony. Roberts gave his age as 79 and
that of his wife as 59. The same wedding :
ring was used that had been used forty j
years ago. The witnesses were their son,
John Roberts, about 35 years of age, and j
John Williams, an old friend of the family.

One Story That Reveals a Horrible Phase
of Slavery.
OGLETHORPE, Ga., Feb/ 12.â A story
which reveals one of the horrible . phases
of slavery, as it was at one time practiced
in the Southern States, has just come to
light here. John Minims, a substantial
negro farmer, took to himself a wife. . The
woman was much his junior,' but it seemed
to be a case of love at first sight.
They were married, and there was hap
piness in their home until a few days ago,
when he and . his wife went to visit his
mother-in-law at Grangerville. It was
then that he discovered that his mother
in-law was one of his -old-time slavery
wives, and that Lizzie Harmon, the
woman to whom he had oeen married
several months, was his own daughter.
It is said that the revelation has so preyed
on the mind of the old man that he will
have to be sent to an asylum. "
FOUND BY CATHODE RAYS.
Bullet in a Man's Hand Located
by the New System of
Photography.
Physicians Able to Extract the Lead
After Experimenting With the
Shadowgraph,
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 12.â The first prac
tical experiment in . Chicago with Roent
gen's rays was made yesterday afternoon
by : Electrician Charles E. Scribner . and
Dr. James Burry in the laboratory of the
Western Electric Company. Caspar
Schmidt came to the office of the Western
Electric Company yesterday complaining
of a sore spot in the region of the palm of
the hand. He said he had been shot in
the hand two years ago, but was unable to
locate the affected spot. . Burry and Scrib
ner decided to use the man for experi
mental purposes.
After an hour's exposure to the cathode
rays the sensitized plate, on which rested
the afflicted member, ; was : taken to the
photographic,, room. When .developed,
the plate disclosed a most excellent like
ness of the anatomy of the hand, and also
what appeared to be a buckshot snugly
ensconced between the metacarpel bones
of the third and fourth .fingers, about an
inch and a half below. the knuckle.
'A, silver print will be made from the
negative this morning, and the buckshot
will then be removed by Dr. Burry, using
the photograph, or shadowgraph, as Dr.
Burry calls it, as a guide. â¢
The experiment will be repeated and
new methods and improved apparatus
will be used. The result obtained yester
day not on I eclipses-all former results
obtained by these, investigators, but gives
credentials to an improved process, which
is probably original with the Chicago men.
In this experiment a lead diaphragm
was used, in which the aperture admitting
the cathode rays was increased from one
half an inch to an inch. In their investi
gations Messrs. Scribner and Burry found
that the glass of which the Crookes tube is
composed is almost opaque to the cathode
ray, while aluminum is translucent. Lead,
however, is impervious to these rays." Ac
cordingly a leaden diaphragm was
stretched between the cathode rays and
the object shadowgraphed for the purpose
of concentrating the rays and securing
more defined outlines on the sensitized
plate. ___^_

AMATEURS OR
PROFESSIONALS.
Racing Wheelmen Must
Declare Where They
Stand.
CLASS B IS ABOLISHED.
The National League Puts an
End to ; the Scandal of
the Track. .
CHEERS GREET THE RESULT.
Delegates Almost Unanimously in
Favor of the Change in the
Constitution.
BALTIMORE, Md., Feb. 12.â 1n conse
quence of the days action by the League
of American Wheelmen convention there
are now but two classes of bicycle racing
men. Class B, generally known as pro
amateurs, is wiped out of existence. There
are 537 of this class of riders, all of whom
will be given the option of either becom
ing amateurs or of accepting professional
ism. This definitely settles an agitation
that has been in progress among wheel
men for years, and has ; taken a most
prominent part in their affairs ever since
the sport was known.
Class B, which is now abolished, was Â»
middle ground between amateurism and
professionalism, and- was adopted by the
bicyclers* body at the suggestion of How
ard B. Raymond of Brooklyn, then chair
man of the National racing board, at the
convention in Louisville in 1893, it having
previously been withdrawn at the conven
tion in New York the year previous.
When cycling began to assume its pres
ent large proportion* and the making of
bicycles opened a wide field for profitable
investment, competition demanded adver
tisement. It was found by the makers
that if they could get fast racing men to
ride their wheels it would greatly aid their
sales, as some of the guileless assumed
that it was the wheel and not the man
that won the races. The reputation of the
great manufacturers of this country and
England were builded on that basis. The
competition then became keen among the
makers for the services of the flyers, and
the rewards to them reached large propor
tions, and thus started the scandal of
bicycle racing which has been wiped out
to-day. There has been growing for years
a sentiment to class these men as profes
sionals, and to-day's action is a fruition
of that agitation. The Immediate result
of the action is to remove the cloak of
amateurism from professionals.
The agitation which led up to the de
cision' was most unexpected. Amend
ments to the constitution and by-laws
were under consideration and several hav
ing a '.bearing' upon 1 class B had been
adopted without an effort from the 'direoJ
tion of abolishing the class. , In the di.-f
cussion of a proposed amendment offered
by Chairman Gideon of the racing board
several amendments to the amendment
were made, until finally Albert Mott of
Baltimore made a motion to strike out all
reference to class B and to make a new
heading in the constitution of "Profes
sional." The suggestion was debated with
growing excitement until the convention
was in an uproar.
The unanimity of the sentiment in
favor of abolishing the B class was unex
pectedly pronounced. Cries of "Vote I"
came from all parts of the hall, and Mr.
Mott's motion was carried almost unani
mously. Three cheers were given when
the result was announced. '

TRIAL OF THE REFORMERS.
Plans of the Men Who Invited Jame
son's Raid Revealed by a
Printer.
LONDON, Eno., Feb. 12.â The Govern
ment has issued a blue boos containing
the dispatches which passed between Mr.
Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the
Colonies; Sir Hercules Robinson, Gover
nor of the Cape Colonies; President Krueger
of the South African Republic, and others
in regard to the disturbances in the Trans
vaal.
The book contains a dispatch from Sir
Jacobus A. Dewet, British diplomatic agent
at Pretoria, which announces that Presi
dent Krueger.upon learning that Dr.Jame
son and his followers had crossed the fron
tier of the Transvaal, made an appeal to
the Governments of Germany and France
for their intervention. On receipt of Sir
J. A. Dewet's dispatch Mr. Chamberlain
telegraphed to Governor Robinson on
January 13 as follows:
"Great Britain will resist at all cost the
interference of any foreign power in the
affairs of the Transvaal. The suggestion "
that Germany had contemplated such a
step was met in this country by an un
precedented and unanimous outburst of
public feeling. Great Britain will not tol
erate any change in her relations with the
Transvaal." . ,-,
Prior to telegraphing Great Britain's i
positive refusal to permit any foreign in- I
terference In the Transvaal, Mr. Cham
berlain wired Governor Robinson
in reply to an inquiry from
President j Krueger in regard to the
destination of the new flying squadron of
British warships, that it was not the
present intention of the Government to
send the squadron to South Africa, as al
ready three British, warships had been
sent to Delagoa Bay, the rendezvous of a
number of foreign war vessels.
Later Mr. Chamberlain informed Gov
ernor Robinson that England, while re
specting the independence of the Trans
vaal on the subject of conventions, would
maintain her position as a paramount
power at all hazards. Concerning Dr.
Jameson's raid, Mr. Chamberlain tele
graphed Governor Robinson instructing
him to represent. to Cecil Rhodes,, the Pre
mier of Cape Colony, that Jameson had
b." guilty of filibustering, and to inform
him that it it should be proved that the Brit
ish South Africa Company was cognizant of
his movements or privy thereto, the Gov
ernment would be called upon to revoke
the company's charter. In any event, he
said, the company would be compelled to
pay an indemnity.
To this cablegram Governor Robinson
replied that he bad Mr. Rhodes' declara
tion that Jameson had acted wholly with
out authority.
The blue book also says that Mr. Cham
berlain telegraphed on January 13 that the
United States Government was informed
that John Hays Hammond, an American
citizen, had been made a prisoner, charged
with treason. Mr. Chamberlain instructed
Governor Robinson to take, upon behalf
of Hammond and the other Americans
, arrested, the same measures that should
be taken on behalf of British subjects.
The blue book also contains a letter
from Hon. Thomas F. Bayard, United
States Embassador, expressing the Ameri
can Government's appreciation of the
courtesy of the British Government to
ward America and her citizens.
GERMANY'S COURSE.
Had Asked Portugal to Be Allowed to
Land Troops. .
BERLIN, Germany, Feb. 12.â The Gov
ernment has issued a white book contain
ing the letters which have passed between
* tbe Government and Count yon Hatzfeldt, i
German Embassador to Great Britain, on
the subject of % the troubles in the Trans
vaal, and also the telegrams sent by the
Emperor to President Krueger at Pretoria.
The white book' shows that' Germany
on January 1 intimated to Portugal that.
Germany expected to rely upon Portugal's
assent to the landing of a German detach
ment at Deiagoa Bay to protect Germany's
threatened subjects.
The book contains the first dispatch sent
by' Freilicrr *" Marshall yon Bjeberstein,"
Minister of Foreign Affairs, to Count yon
Hatzfeldt, German Embassador to Great
Britain, written in February, 1895. This
letter refers to remarks made by the Earl
of Kimberley, then British Foreign Minis
ter, in regard to President Krueger's toast
to the Emperor of Germany in honor of
that- monarch's birthday. 'i^^^^_S__jm
The German Minister, in this communi
cation, declares that the material interests
of Germany â¢ require that- the Transvaal
shall be . maintained as an - independent'
state in accordance . with the terms of the
treaty of 1884, and that the status quo re
gardine the railways and the harbor of
Deiagoa Bay be upheld. . v
Dr. Jameson's idea, he says, that Rhode
sia was to become a federation of all the
South African States antagonized the
interests of Germany. To this Count
Hatzfeld replied that Lord Salisbury had
expressed : his concurrence with Germany
in her desire to maintain the status quo of
the Transvaal. â ,{:'?'â 
December 30 last Emperor William re
ceived a telegram from trie .Germans of
Pretoria beseeching German ' intervention
to prevent ; bloodshed. The next day the
German Foreign * Minister wired the Ger
man Consul at Pretoria, authorizing him in
an emergency, after consulting President
Kruger. to make requisition for a. landing
party from the German warship Zee Adler,
as long as might be necessary. Tne Portu
guese Government was at the - same time
informed that the permission of Portugal
was relied upon to land a detachment of
German sailors at Deiagoa Bay.
On January 1 Count yon Hatzfeldt in
formed his Government that he was im
pressed with trie belief that the British
Government was greatly displeased 'at
Jameson's raid.
In conclusion the White Book contains a
dispatch from the German Foreign Min
ister to the German Embassador at Lon
don protesting against- the attitude taken
by the British press | in assumine ' that the
Emperor's- telegram. to President Kruger
was hostile to Great Britain or an invasion
of, British rights. J â¢. ;-V -"â¢>

WORK OF A DAY
IN CONGRESS.
Objections to the Creation
of More National
Holidays. '
MR. HILL'S AMENDMENT.
Would Have Jackson Honored
Also if the Lincoln Bill
Were Passed.
PROCEEDINGS IN THE HOUSE .
Representatives Argue Upon the Free-
Coinage Substitute ;to the
Bond Bill. \
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb, 12.â The
birthday of Abraham Lincoln, the 12th of
February, would have been added to the
list of American holidays, so far as the
action of the Senate' could do so, had it
not been for a single objection. *", A bill for
that purpose, which had . been introduced
some time ago :by Hansbrough 5 (R.) of
North Dakota, was to-day reported by him
from the Committee on the Library; and
just as the Senate was on the eve â " of
adjournment it occurred to Hale â¢ (R.) of
Maine that it would be a fitting; and grace
ful thing to pass the â¢ bill to-day, and be
asked unanimous consent to have that
done. â  . '.
Hill (D.) of New York had contemplated
offering an amendment to the bill, adding
Jackson's birthday (January 8) also to the
list of National holidays, but under the
peculiar circumstances he said he would
withhold such amendment and offer it as
a separate proposition. â  Then Hawiey (R.)
of Connecticut interposed an objection, on
the ground that there was danger of run
ning to an extreme on this question.
A resolution was offered by Vest (D.) of
Missouri and agreed to, calling on the Sec
retary of Agriculture for a statement as
to recent changes ordered by him in the
quarantine lines established in relation to
the transportation of cattle from "Texas
and other Southwestern States, and as to
the reason therefor. ," "' â¢
A resolution was offered by Peffer (P.) of
Kansas and went over until to-morrow for
the appointment of a select committee of
five Senators to inquire into and report on
all the facts and circumstances connected
with the sales of United States bonds by
the Secretary of the Treasury in 1894, 1895
and 1896.
A resolution was offered by Allen (Pop.)
of NebrasKa calling on the Secretary of the
Interior for a large mass of details in re
lation to the Union Pacific, the Sioux City
and Pacific and the Kansas Pacific rail
road companies. Wolcott(R.) of Colorado
suggested to Allen that his resolution i
called for statements which the Secretary
of the Interior could not possibly supply,
such as the names of stockholders and
bondholders and 1 the amounts of stocks
and bonds held by them. The resolution
went over under the rule.
Teller (R.) of ' Colorado introduced a bill
to provide for the redemption of National
bank notes, and it was referred to the Fi
nance Committee.
Hansbrough (R.) of North Dakota re
ported from the Library Committee a bill
to make the 12th of Februaryâ Lincoln's
birthdayâ a National holiday, and it was
placed on the calendar. % "\A
The bill passed by the Senate some
weeks ago for a memorial bridge across
the Potomac, but which had been sus
pended" by a motion to reconsider, was on
motion of Daniel (D.) of Virginia taken up
and the passage of the bill considered.
The amendment offered byÃlanchard (D.)
of Louisiana, requiring half of the cost of
the bridge to be paid ; by the District of
Columbia, was rejectedâ ayes 8, noes 54â
and the bill was passed. It directs the
Secretary of v - War to construct a memorial
bridge from .the observatory grounds
across the Potomac River to the Arlington
estate, and appropriates $100,000 for the
necessary surveys.
The urgent deficiency bill was taken up.
The amendment for the appointment of
expert money-counters in â  the treasury,
which had led yesterday to a discussion of
civil service reform, was the first question
reached. It was agreed to without further
discussion and without a division. The
committee amendment appropriating
$230,500 for fees and expenses of United
States Marshals and deputies -provoked a
discussion, in which the whole fee system
was denounced as not only an outrage, but
a standing disgrace to ; Congress for allow-"
ing it to exist. The Indian Territory was
particularly specified as the very worst ju
dicial district in respect to arrests being
made for the mere sake of fees. The bill
went over without final action.
A bill for the admission of Arizona as a
State was introduced by Carter (R.) of
Montana and referred.
Hale (R.) of Maine asked unanimous
.consent to have taken up and passed the
bill reported to-day for the observance of
the 12th of February (Lincoln's birthday)
as a National holiday. -- f
Hill (D.) of New York said that :he had
intended to propose an amendment to the
bill, but he would not do so now, and
would introduce a separate bill to create
Jackson's birthday, the Bth of January, a
National holiday. Hale ' thought that it
would be a very fitting and graceful thing
to pass the bill to-day, this being the 12th
of February. ..; >â â â 'â '"-::â  .'':â ' ~>/y-' ""-'â '-'.'. ,'" '.'â --... â 
'':'. Hawiey (R.) of Connecticut said that he
did not wish -to act ungraciously, in the
matter,. but he was opposed to creating
any more National holidays. There was
danger; he \ thongnt,' ; of running into ex
tremes like some countries â 'which had so
many * saints', days 'that people were seri
ously deprived of opportunities to work.
After a short pause he said : "I â¢ believe -I
will object." â  ,
"Of course," said Hale. "It can only be
done by unanimous consent."
The Senate at 4:15 o'clock adjourned
until to-morrow. . w r* "
IN THE HOUSE.
Several â  Big Guns Fired in the Finan
"â '-',, cial Debate. .:';
WASHINGTON, ID. C, : Feb.-^.--Sev
eral big /guns : were fired in the financial
debate in the House ; to-day, and the pro
ceedings were among the most interesting
of the protracted discussion. Dolliver (R.)
of lowa and McMilliri (D. of Tenessee, of
the Committee on Ways s Means, V re
spectively > opposed and advocated ' the
Senate's free-coinage substitute for the
House bond bill. ' -Â
The Senate joint resolution appropriat
ing $75,000 to pay, the joint expenses of the
survey of the v boundary- ; line between
.Alaska and British North American ; pos
sessions was reported from the Committee
on Appropriations and passed.'",
The hour and a half prior to the opening
session of Wednesday's legislative > day
in the House was . largely given over to
the advocates of the Senate's free-silver
substitute. It was supported by Under
wood (D.) of Alabama ' and Cox (D.) of
Tennessee. Brumm (R.) of Pennsplvania,
while not approving the Senate substitute
to the full extent, announced his intention
to offer an amendment similar to the Mor
rill amendment and expressed the belief
that the House was not now called upon
to press the bond bill as it originally
passed. At 11:57 the House adjourned
Tuesday's session. .
"In the prayer with which the proceed
ings of Wednesday were opened Chaplain
Coudert made "Abraham Lincoln the sub
ject, returning; thanks for the qualities
with which men had been endowed, as ex
emplified in his character, and praying
that we may emulate the, virtues which
shone in him "with malice toward none
and with charity for all." . â¢â 
Considerable amusement was occasioned
by Kern (Pop.) of Nebraska, who rose to a
question of personal privilege.', \He stated
that in the Record of this morning there
appeared under the heading, "Coin Re
demptionâRemarks of Hon. Omar M.
Kern of Nebraska in the House of ' Repr
esentatives, Wednesday, February 5, 1896,"
a straight, radical, goldbug speech. Per
kins (R.) of lowa solemnly inquired if the
gentleman disclaimed the remarks there
imputed to him.
Mercer (R.) of Nebraskaâ Oh, -' I . hope
not. I wish for once that the delegation
from Nebraska could be solid on the finan
cial question. â  *
Kern took the matter rather earnestly
and said: "Some gentlemen ask if I was
hypnotized.'*' [Laughter.] 1 can imagine
that an advocate of the single gold stand
ard should be hypnotized, and believe
most of them are, but I cannot understand
how a free-silver man can be hypnotized at
any time or at anyplace." â :
W. A. Stone (R.) of ' Pennsylvania
the Record shows you to have a lucid'in
terval, why not let it stand? [Laughter.]
Resuming, Kern said it was evident that
a grave mistake had occurredâ he must be
charitable and put that construction upon
itâ but that he could not understand how
it occurred. He therefore moved,' unless
some gentleman would, rise and father the
remarks, which he entirely repudiated,
that they be expunged from the ; Record.
- It was explained that the error was one
which could be corrected, and that would
be done. The speech was prepared by
Kerr (R.) of Ohio and furnished under the
general leave to print. At the printing
office the mistake was 'made of imputing
the speech to Kern/ . -
Recurring then to the bond-silver coin
ace bill the House in committee of the
whole, Payne (R.) of New York in the
chair, heard Dolliver (R.) of lowa, a mem
ber of the Committee on Ways and Means,
resume the discussion. He felicitated
himself that the questions of economy and
finance could be, and always had been,
safely left to the conservative judgment of
tbe American people. In other countries
they were for the' settlement of financiers
and statesmen only. He felicitated him-*
self that the Republican party was broad
enough and generousenougu to hospitably
receive and entertain the matured opinions
of any man upon these subjects.
Mr. Dolliver said that of ail the proposi
tions relating to the money question he
had separated two which he thought the
American people were solidly in favor of.
These were, first, that every dollar circulat
ed in the country should bear the National
â¢ stamp and not be | left to the varying in
â  fluences of State legislation; and second,
that every dollar thus stamped should bit
equal in purchasing power to every other
dollar. After reading foreign treatises of
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries he
had formed these conclusions on the sub
ject: ,- "â  ' 'â¢' â â -'â  â  â  '".''. " '"" ' :
Firstâ any coin minted under free
coinage is bound, in â¢ the long run to par
take of the value of the metal contained in
it. â  ' â â¢;::â : -. -â --;, -. . ..- â '- . â  ...
Secondâ That any nation making coins
of two metals of the same nominal value
stands to lose instantly the coin made of
the metal which is undervalued.
In conclusion Dolliver said: "Beginning
with the issue of greenbacks and going on
to the establishment of the National
banks, to the payment of the public debt
in coin, to the demonetization of silver, to
the resumption of specie paymentsâ every
one of those acts, every act complained of
as part of a conspiracy against the people
of the United States, has upon it the sig
nature and approval either of Abraham
Lincoln or of Ulysses S. Grantâ every one.
[Applause.] /
"If that is not an accurate historical
statement I desire somebody to cor
rect, it."
' Kern âBut is it not true that President
Grant made the statement that when he
signed the bill demonetizing silver he did
not know the effect of it?
Dolliverâ l don't know whether it is true
or not, but if he made that statement after
his Secretary of the Treasury had twice
recommended "the measure to Congress
and after Congress bad debated it through
187 columns of the Congressional Globe, if,
after all that, he made, such a statement,
then he was wanting in that wisdom which
the world by common consent has attrib
uted to Ulysses S. Grant.
ARIZONA'S MARTYRDOM.
Statehood Defeated to Prevent the Acqui
sition of Votes for Silver.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 12.âNot
withstanding the secrecy of the House
Territories Committee's : . meeting this
morning, it is .known that it has taken
up the Arizona statehood bill and that the
measure was defeated by six to five. The
significance of the vote is better under
stood when it is remembered that the op
position to the admission of Arizona is
based on the - belief that the erantingof
statehood would increase the. number of
free silver advocates in the Senate. This
was the primary cause of defeat. â¢ â 
It is also regarded as an indication of
the sentiment of the committee with refer
ence to the New Mexico and : Oklahoma
bills, the passage of which, in addition to
the Arizona bill, would add six new. Sena
tors, to the list of free coinage men. â¢'.'

Mystery of the Great Yolo Train
Robbery Solved by Detective
Thacker.
SACRAMENTO, . Cal., Feb. 12. â The
mystery which has so long hung over the
disappearance of $51,900, the proceeds of
the great Yolo train-robbery which oc
curred on the 11th of October, 1894, has at
last been solved. A man who has been.,
living like an Eastern nabob on the hard
pelf of Wells, Fargo & Co. for the past few
months occupies a cell in the County Jail,
and at least $6000 of the stolen money has
been returned to the coffers of the
company. * ;. â¢.'_"â  ,y f ; : \ -
For the past three years a member of the
tramp fraternity known as Karl has re
sided in a brush camp within 100 yards of
the place where Browning and Brady so
hastily buried the â¢ proceeds of their suc
cessful robbery. The real name of this
man is J. P. Harman. Some four days
after the robbery Harman, or Karl, as he
Is better known, found the money, divided
it up into separate parcels and reburied it
in other spots. J â ;"â -.
Some ; time afterward he took . a portion J
of the gold, as he claims, $10,000, and went |
to San Francisco, where he : represented I
that he had been left a large fortune by |
relatives' in theold country. He engaged
apartments at 918 Folsom street, which
he furnished in the most luxurious style,
and immediately proceeded to procure
himself an outfit of silk underwear and
other clothing fit for any prince of the
blood. i
Harman soon demonstrated that he was
a blood of the bloods and knew how to
spend his money in wine dinners and the
society of women, and his ill-gotten wealth j
disappeared like the dew before the morn
ing sun. < - . â  V.: 1 "- "â¢'
In the meantime Detective Thacker had
obtained a clew to the disappearance of
Karl from his chosen haunts in the brushy
precincts of Yolo County and had been
endeavoring to get trace of him. * ; ' '
Eventually he found that he had been
intimate with a man named Augustine,
who resided in Sacramento. , He found the j
latter, who admitted that before K?.rd left j
Sacramento be had sent him, Augustine, I
over to his camp in the woods to get a
quantity of provisions which was there.
When he got to the camp he found a num
ber of papers in which money had te?n
wrapped.
Last week Thacker obtained a trace of
Karl in San Francisco, and soon afterward
had him pointed out by another German. !
Thacker accosted the man and. requested
him to accompany him to Wells-Fargo's
office. He did so, and was there accused i
of having taken the money.
Pinned down, he acknowledged that he
had found the coin, but insisted that he
had only taken $10,000. He gave up $2049,
â which was deposited in the German-Bank.
At Thacker's request he accompanied the
latter to Sacramento and went to the place
where the money had been buried. On
their return Karl was arrested â¢ by Sheriff
Johnson and charged with secreting money"
known to have been stolen.
Thacker then went to San Francisco and
found that ; Karl had loaned a sum of
money to H. S. Kordt, a wine merchant of
Battery street. The latter stated that
Karl had requested him to take $20,000,
but he had refused. He had borrowed,
however, $6100, giving his note for the
same. This sum was also recovered as has
been a $200 diamond stud, a $175 gold
watch a very large assortment of valuable
clothing. 'J
Karl has loaned and spent, In all, $11,000
of the proceeds of the robbery, and it is
believed . that he knows where the balance
of the stolen wealth is secreted.
Several months ago Thacker found
$18,000 buried near the scene of the rob
bery. Brady and Browning . took ;' about
$1700, and Karl has accounted for $11,000
and probably could account for the rest.
A DESERTER'S PERILOUS SWIM.
Dragged - From the - Water at Port An

PORT ANGELES, Wash., Feb. 12.âAde
serter from the English ship Buckingham
was found at 2 o'clock; this morning swim
ming out in the middle of the bay. He
was ma king for shore at the time he was
rescued, but was so exhausted and be
numbed with cold that he would have per
ished within a short , time. The sailor's
cries for help attracted the attention of
those on shore, but owing to the darkness
it was a long time before his position could
be located. When hauled into T a boat it
was found that he was clad in a heavy suit
of clothes and had on three suits of under-'
clothing. He had 1 cut out the pockets of
his coat : and trousers 'in . order that his
progress through -, the water might not be
retarded. The. Buckingham was i being
towed out of port at' the time the sailor
left her, and the only reason he gave for
deserting was that he had been shipped
while drunk and did not want to take a
five months' cruise. *

IVAN KOVALEV
A CRAVEN COWARD
May Die of Fear Before
the Date Set for His
Execution.
WARDEN AULL SPEAKS.
The Brutal L Murderer of the
Webers Has Suffered a Thou
sand Deaths^ '/
HAUNTED BY THE DAY OF DOOM.
Heedless of Surroundings His Thoughts
Dwell on the Fact That ;He
Must Hang.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 12.â As the
day approaches upon which Ivan Kovalev,
the Russian escape from Saghalien Island,
must expiate his crime on the gallows for
the brutal murder ;ofâ¢ W. Weber and
wife in this city, the prisoner shows more;
and more his intense fear of stepping over
the boundary into .the great unknown.
Ivan Kovaley, the brutal murderer of
the aged couple, is a coward of the worst
description. The man who without com
punction could rain blow after blow with
an ax on his feeble victims, walk bare
footed in their gore, coolly rifle
the residence, remove j his ' torn arid
verm in- infested garments, replacing
them with , the clothes of the murdered
man, then, return to his old-time haunts
in San Francisco and spend the proceeds
in, wild revelry, fears to meet his. death
with an intense fear that may yet result in
his cheating the gallows. '..- 'â ' *"
Several weeks ago Warden Charles Anil
stated that be had never seen a man so
absolutely consumed by fear as was
Kovalev, and he added: . ;;*;Â«Â£**.:â 
' â¢'I doubt if he will ever live to mount
the gallows. I think the man will die of
fear before the time for his execution ar
rives." ;. â¢ '. â¢' ,*.' i
Kovalev occupies a cell in the solitary
ward of the prison, but has several com
panions who are also doomed to a dis
| graceful death, yet he pays little heed to
! his surroundings and all his thaughts
seem to dwell on the fact that he must die,
and in imagination he has suffered a thou
sand deaths since his removal to Folsom
State Prison.
CHICO MERCHANTS SWINDLED.
Crooked Work on the. Part of Advertise
ment Solicitors.
. CHICO, Cal.. Feb. 12.â old game
of a man and his confidence schemes has
cropped out again in Chico, and a good
many of our prominent business men are
.interested; but few will lose more than
the .money already advanced.
Last ;â¢ September _ man signing himself
J. H. Hunter arrived in Chico and visited
the business houses in town for the pur
pose of securing advertising in a Pacific
Coast directory. He claimed to be repre
senting the "Merchants' Publishing Com
pany of 632 Market street, San Francisco.
He set up the value of a card, or "head
ings," in this directory, and asked $2 50 for
publishing the same.
Many were coaxed into the scheme, paid
Hunter $2 50 ' and \ took his receipt for the
money. But in order to have the name
and ' business â  properly printed Hunter
asked each' advertiser to write his name
and business on a piece of paper. That
paper had a little printing on it and sev
eral blank lines, but this the advertiser
paid little attention to.
Nothing more was heard of the matter
until last Saturday, when a new man ap
peared in Chico, went to these Chico mer
chants- and v demanded $3 from each for
advertising their business in a United
States directory published in New York.
The .demand was politely refused, each
man stating that he had not given an or
der to any New York i rectory. The agent,
who signed his name H. S., then produced
an order bearing the advertiser's signa
ture, agreeing to advertise to the extent of
$3 in the Continental Commercial Register.
That there is a swindle on the part of
J. H. Hunter or H. S. or the companies
they are supposed to represent is evident.

PROTECTION
VS. FREE TRADE.
Stanford Struggling With a
Question That Puzzles
Statesmen. v '
BOTH SIDES SCORE POINTS
Master of the State Grange an
Eager Listener to the
' Discussion; -
THE ISSUE SWAYS THE NATION .
Overproduction, Improved Machinery
and Cheap Transportation
Cause Low Prices.
â  .â¢ \ "â¢ â¢
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Feb.
12. The preliminary discussion of . the
Lubin - proposition took place before the
Economic Seminary yesterday afternoon.
Professor Ross introduced Mr. Greer,
master of the Grange of California, who
opened ; his remarks with the statement
that he came to hear the discussion as a
representative of the farmers of California.
The farmers, he said, had taken great in
terest in a proposition which seemed to' be
a method for equitably, adjusting relations
between tbe manufacturer and the farmer.
One hour and ten minutes was allowed
to each side. The speakers \ against the
proposition-, were Messrs. A. M. Cathcart
and J. M. Ross. The question was: "Re
solved, That, assuming protection \to be
the policy of this country, it is just and
expedient that a compensatory bounty be
paid on export of staple products."
, Mr. Lubin stated that he did not claim
to be an orator, but he wished to convince
by the plain statement of fact. .;".' >
I He had ' addressed J a large number of
citizens in San Francisco on the question
where a vote was taken on the question
after . a speech by John P. Irish, with the
usual result after one of ' that orator's
efforts. _ He wanted no vote at Stanford,
but he wanted a silent conviction to be
burned into the heart of each of his au
ditors on a question that swayed the
Nation. ~.. ; , ,-'.
The speaker stated that , Mr. Greer had
issued directions to each of .the Grange
organizations of California to sent, peti
tions to Congressional representatives to
support bill "No. 2626. This would have its
result. â¢â¢ ;' . *Â..'_ 'Â.'.'-,.''(',(."
"Tbe question is not one of free trade or
protection, but it is assumed," said the
speaker, "by the debaters that this is the
question. ; The question is to be considered
from an equitable standpoint. . So long as
a protective system is in operation, pre
venting the entry of . cheaper goods,
whether that system has :or has not( ac
complished this, whether" free trade* is
good or not is not the question. -,U fi.",vs^
: "The .question is, Assuming protection
to be the policy of the Nation, is jit]" just
to, refuse protection to the producers r of
staple articles by an export bounty?", ; , 4
J. M. Ross, '97, was the first .speaker
against the proposition. He called atten
tion to the terms "just," "equitable," "ex
pedient," and explaining their meaning,
he continued: .â V.-
"The failing in agricultural prices has
been \ much overdrawn. All productions,
agricultural and otherwise, have fallen
together, due to improved machinery, im
proved . transportation and other causes.
Until it can be sbown that the farmer has
been injured by the tariff it is unnecessary
to demand that he be protected therefrom
by a bounty. . '
-"Over-production for export is itself
largely to blame < for the fall in prices of
agricultural stables. The proposal is un
just to the taxpayer, on whom another
tax is laid 'by the proposed ; bounty. The
farmer cannot have his wheat protected
from the Russian and Indian product even
by. the paternal efforts of a Government
bounty. The export ; price will govern the
home price, and as only one-tenth of the
cereal production is 1 exported; the nine
tenths at home must be paid for by con
sumers at the increased rate.
; "It would be a class legislation, capable
of being made use of ,in ; political corrup
tion. The bounty system has been found
to be a source of great corruption. V;. -'^
* '"The granting of the proposed bounty,
it has - been ' shown, would be unjust, first,
because tho farmers have - not borne the
burdens of protection; second, because the
weight of those burdens ( tend to increase ;
.third, because the farmer have no especial
claim to compensation, since S his troubles
do not originate in the tariff, and, fourth,
because the \ bounty would, be an inexcus
j able tax upon other unprotected - classes."
Mr. Lubin then rose to refute the argu
ments of Mr. Rose. â â 'â¢â â â  -' -,: -4 â¢
"We do not take into consideration," he
said, "the rise or the fall in cereals. The
question is that if half the producers
or manufacturers are protected, the other
halfâ the : farmers, ; the agricultural pro
ducersâmust >in ; equity, ; and -? justice ; ' be
protected. The little ; brown man, so small
and contemptible now, will â ' in '. time* be
come the , master of the so-called mon
archy v Anglo-Saxon, jif he is given .a
chance, j When .agriculture is killed you
kill the republic. ,
, Mr. A. M. Cathcart, '96, said the bounty
would mean * the appropriation of .public
money for a class. ,No matter how small,
the scheme is inequitable. He cited bounty
export schemes of England, showing .that
j prices fell after going into . operation . in
stead of ' rising, and cited * tables showing
what" a' small portion of the cereal produc
tion was exported. *.-. â¢-,â¢-";
; He argued that an export bounty would
increase , exports, but the price of staples
would fall; that is. the world price would
â¢ ultimately become less. The ; bounty
would not .; create , any new wealthâ what
the farmer might ') gain the . public would
loseâ while . the loss 5: of National wealth
(distributed on .account, of , the bounty
throughout the world) would be an un
necessary, unjust loss to farmers as' well as
others. 'â â¢-â  >- - '
i In; closing, Mr. Lubin showed that the
English bounty probably failed â  because
the bounty was paid only incase "the^^ prod
ucts were transported on English vessels.
The sugar bounty was cited as an example
of a bounty which had done " great benefit
in Germany. The price of sugar had fallen
â¢ on account of the opening of new fields in
. France, .Austria;; the United â¢: States and
â¢ elsewhere. "â '-â " 'â  ,? â¢ " :v'-V â  â â :
$^Mr^-Lubin ; himself 1 now brought >. out a
collection of pamphlets and " from 'them
J quoted figures showing what . he called a
"birdses'e view of what protection: really
means.!?- He endeavored to prove that the
system of ; protection ,to : one class had in
reality meant an enormous, unseen, mis
understood tax on ; the people. By these
figures he , sought to prove that it was a
merely just extension of a protective
policy. â  t
The Lubin discussion was continued in
the evening, . Mr. ; Lubin . defending his
proposition from the attacks of Professor'
Powers. The chapel was 3 filled with stu
dents, and as the discussion at times be
came warm and the cuts and. pairies were
fast and furious, the debate was quite in
teresting. ',â .â¢â â â¢ 'â -
â  W. W. Greer, master of the State Grange ,
was the first .speaker. â¢â ; introduced and
stated his object in being", present, which
was to listen to a, proposition discussed
whose effect had much to do apparently
with the farmer's welfare. *''
v Congressman Johnson; he said, had in
troduced r a bill into Congress drawing at
tention to this question. The farmers rec
ognized that they should receive the same
protection from i the Government as that
accorded to other industries. If there was
any weakness in the Lubin proposition the
sooner it could be shoT? n the better it would
be for the farmer. ; t â â *.'â : ' â¢
Â Professor Ross said in substance that if
a protection tariff actually accomplished
all that had been claimed for itâ which he
proceeded to show it did notâ then an
extension was entirely proper 1 and the
farmers should i receive the . benefit of the
extended principle. "The proposition ad
vanced by Mr. Lubin had this much in its
favorâ it was an equitable method for do
ing for the farmers what was and is being
done for other industries.
The speaker showed how the bounty
was opposed on â ; protective principles as
well as on free-trade principles, yet such
opposition, he asserted, was hardly con
sistent. It is true that alone the bounty
might not be a good 'thing; neither is the
protective tariff, yet both combined might
make a very desirable system. .
The speaker then proceeded to show how
the tariff actually created new industries;
but this was its one sole benefit, and once
those industries were fairly started the
protective system became class legislation
and was unjust. The fact that it was con
tinued could not be taken as a basis for a
proposition said to be equitable, yet based
onan unjust principle.
. Mr. Lubin's speech was much line
with his afternoon ' arguments, viz. : That
his - proposition was not class legislation,
in that it merely put all on the same basis.
It was but the . extension of the protective
policy. 'â¢â ' - ; " -â¢'
He asserted its justice, and by concrete
examples sought to show that at present
the farmer, who was the real wealth crea
tor, was paying more than all other labor
in taxesâ indirectly levied. He grew quite
sarcastic at times, and gave the professors
several digs on their stand toward the
scheme. . ...... .

SOME STRONG MEN
The Way In Which They Pose
; : Before the Public.
Truth About the Workings of These
"Men of Muscle."
THERE ABE .NOT A J FEW ENTHUSIASTS
who are wrapped up in the feats of the men
.with highly developed muscles who are known
as the "strong men'' of the world. Those easily
impressed wonderâ they admireâ they in fact
worship. But it-only needs the most ordinary
industry to develop as the result of inquiry that
the faculty of -these "strong men" as "stayers"
â¢is very small. 1 . And, indeed, if tbe truth were
told, they would most of them have "a weak
back" very suddenly if they were called on to
do an ordinary day's work. Most people know
what that weak back means. It means a cer-
tain Indication that the individual who has it
is not in good health. It may mean (taken in
the abstract as a symptom) that one Is suffer-
ing from a severe nervous disorder, for in-
stance. But as a rule it-means that the system
is "run down," and from" this state the most
serious illnesses of which the world has any
record grow. Any one who has any doubt on
that matter may very readily have his ideas
put right by consulting any reputable man
who has ever s suffered from it. Perhaps a
brighter or better example could not be found
than Mr. George H. Bent of Rochester, Cal.
Not long ago Mr. Bent found himself with a
weak back and a completely shattered aystem,
and placed himselfâ as he was in imminent
dangerâ in communication with the physicians
of the great HUDSON MEDICAL INSTITUTE.
That was the most sensible thing he could have
done under the circumstances, of course, and
now that they have saved his life (as he is
abundantly willing to testify) he has written
them a letter of thanks. It is of interest be-
i cause, although he has virtually been snatched
from the jaws of death, his back still bother*
him a little, showing how vital is that symptom.
ROCHESTER (Cal.), August 3, 1895.
Hudson Medical Institute, San Francisco,
Cal.â Dear Sirs: Yours of 24th duly received.
This is where the good feeling comes in, for I
am sure that you like to hear from patients
who, like myself, are about cured. lam sure I
like to be able to write in this way, for as I am
now, I think that by the time. that I get the
medicine taken that I am on now I shan't need
to take any more if you think I will stay this
way. My back does not bother me hardly any
now, anal feel batter in every way. Yours
very truly, GEORGE H. BENT.
Mr. Bent's letter bears on it the very impres-
sion of truth, and he is like hundreds of other
patients of that gratiflest of all curative estab-
lishments, the HUDSON MEDICAL INSTITUTE,
in that he, knowing where he has received
great good, is not ashamed or afraid to tell of it.
For example:
8. M. Hooker ot Los Angeles says; "I ant
very grateful for what you have done for me."
E. W. Fowler, Kamele, Or.: "I am feeling as
good now as it is possible for a man to feel.
J. T. Ward of Park City, Utah, writes: "l am
very pleased to say that I am cured ot the ter-
rible disease that I had."
â¢ If testimony of this sort does not show skill
that cannot be surpassed, what on earth can f
No! It does bring conviction to every honest
mind, and as relief is certain it is a truthful
motto that if you are ill at all "THE HUDSON
MEDICAL INSTITUTE is by all means the best
place to apply for help." '~,V' .

FOR THE COURT.
Some Clever but Crooked
Work in a Pool-Sell
ing Case.
A POOL MAN GOT A TIP.
Money Invested by the Disguised
Police Officer Sent to
the Track.
FIRST BEFORE JUDGE LOW.
Went on Appeal to Judge Wallace.
The Defendant Only Performed
Messenger Service.
Some ugly facts are coming to light con
cerning the methods used to juggle with
justice in the pool-selling cases.
'- The noted counsel retained by the pool
men Lawyers Foote, Dickinson and
Kahnâ with great force on the
Dnscoll case on Judge Wallace's discharge
.. of.Slater.
When the Driscoll case was called in the
Police Court the argument advanced was
that the testimony was the same as that
on which Wallace discharged the de
fendant in the Slater trial, and, therefore,
Driscoll should not be held.
The Slater case was heard in Police
Judge Low's court, and the record of
appeal to the Superior Court was there
made up.
There is good testimony that Judge Low
entertained a very strong opinion shortly
after the case was appealed, if not during
the trial, that the case was "cooked" for
the purpose of getting the kind of a record
before the Superior Court that the pool
sellers most desired. Connected with the
trial were some features that certainly sur
prised John T. Dare, the prosecuting at
torney.
It cannot now be asserted that the
police officer who was disguised in citizen's
clothing and charged with the duty of
personating a simple purchaser of a pool
ticket on the race gave a tip revealing his
true motive to the seller of the ticket, but
" there is a certainty that some one be
trayed the prosecution. The pool-seller in
some way ascertained that this particular
purchaser was a policeman in disguise.
It was known to the pool-seller when the
disguised police officer would appear. It
was known in advance of the transaction
that an arrest would follow. Here is
where the record for the Superior Court
began. The identical money which the
disguised policeman handed over to the
pool-seller was immediately dispatched by
special messenger to the racetrack, and
this fact, very important to the defense,
was constantly presented to Judge Wallace
of the Superior Court. â¢ . - . y
Therein Judge Wallace was deceived
and misled. "No one ventures to assert
that eminent counsel for the pool-sellers
knew that the Judge was being treated to
,-; "cooked case. No one fancied for an
.''"instant that Judge Wallace himself would
V suspect collusion between police officers
" and pool-sellers, but, nevertheless, outside
facts point distinctly to the conclusion
that the case was made up to present to
the Judge of the Superior Court a feature
of special messenger service, and in the
preparation of these specialties the cause
of injustice was materially served by some
one in close touch with the Police.De
partment.
When Judge Wallace read the testimony
taken in the trial before Judge" Low
in the Police Court, and listened to
the logic of Foote, heard the eloquence
of Kahn and saw the gestures of Dickin
son, he decided from a review of the testi
mony that the person who secured the
disguised policeman's money simply per
formed messenger ! service in" sending the
Bum out to the track for investment.
For example, the transaction was
likened by counsel for the defendant as
something after this style: "Foote sees
General Dickinson going" out to the races
and, happening to have an engagement in
town that afternoon, says: 'Here is $10,
Dickinson. Invest it for meat the .races.' "
Judge Wallace took that view of the
transaction. The case was made up below
to present that very significant feature to
his attention. The money handed over
by the disguised policeman was sent to the
track for investment. No wager was made
on a horse, no commission was charged
and no law was broken.
Police Judge Low and Prosecuting At
torney John T. Dare are making careful
inquiry into _ the transaction. It has
already come' to the knowledge of the
latter that the- discharged pool-seller has
made this boast: "I knew the instant the
fellow offered his money that he was a
capper for the police, and so I sent a
special messenger out to the track with
his coin."
Prosecuting Attorney Dare is not dis
couraged. He has proposed to try a case
every day if Chief Crowlev will have an
arrest made every day. "The law as it
P stands now is ample to suppress pool
selling, and the Prosecuting Attorney is
confident that convictions can be secured
that must be sustained by the Superior
Court.
POOLROOM "NUISANCES."
John T. Dare Says the Existing Law
Is Ample for Their Sup
pression.
John T. Dare, Prosecuting Attorney of
â¢ Police Court No. 3, adheres strongly to the
opinion that the laws .as they stand are
sufficient to suppress pool-selling and
poker games in the City. He is opposed
to further municipal legislation, because
' additional legislation means further delay.
As Mr. Dare expresses it: "We want .no
more laws, but we want a reasonably
stringent enforcement of the laws as they
now stand."
The Prosecuting Attorney argues that
the Supreme : Court has' held that if the
Judge can ascertain from the text of the
law the manifest, intention of the law
maker that is the construction to be placed
on the law.
The Supreme Court has decided that the
Legislature has power to conler on the
Board of Supervisors the right to pass
ordinances and police regulations. In the
exercise of that authority an ordinance to
prohibit pool-selling has been adopted.
In order that the intention of the law
makers may be clearly understood -the ,
ordinance As prefaced by a preamble set
ting forth its object. The Supreme Court â¢
has always maintained that the people
shall never be called upon, to establish a
negative, and therefore in the prosecution
of pool-sellers it â¢; is i not required of â¢' the
prosecution to prove affirmatively that the
pool-sellers do send money to the race
course.. *
â  (That the poolrooms are a public nui
sance, the Prosecuting Attorney has no
doubt, but whether" in this i; community
â¢ they would be so classed, is another ques
tion. In Kentucky, for exam pie. they have
been closed under the law against main
taining a public nuisance. Our courts here
; give a broad construction to all questions
touching public morals. If a man rents a
IMMIIIi i HI iilliillnwn ili'iwli I 1 1 in â â â â  nilii nnilium .
room, lights it and supplies service, it is re
garded as the proper thing to derive a good
round sum of : money for the investment.
The courts and the public are not inclined
to inquire := whether morals ' are corrupted
and = decency â is defiled by the establish
ment, : '. i <;.;â : ,-.--'. " . ...
Mr. Dare is fully aware of the fact, and
directs attention to it, that the gamblers
and the men who hang about the pool
rooms and poker dens contribute nothing
to ; the prosperity of , the City. They per
form no public service, pay no taxes and
shirk all responsibilities of citizenship.
Yet these men are the first to call for po
lice protection, and some of them have the
hardihood to demand.that officers be sta
tioned at their places to enable them to
conduct their business successfully.
Despite all, the powerful influence and
cunning tricks employed to falsify records
of appeal and to defeat the ends of justice
by fraud and collusion, Prosecuting At
torney Dare is vet confident that convic
tions will follow until the pool-sellers
downtown will be compelled to acknowl
edge the supremacy of the law.
It has been proposed to Chief Crowley
that the Police Department make one
arrest a day. The Prosecuting Attorney
is willing to try one case a day and believes
in seven cases out of ten conviction can be
obtained. The plan proposed is to keep
sending the cases to the \ higher court and
if not sustained to bow in humble sub
mission to the decree and try again.
From other sources it is learned that
several of the poolroom managers are get
ting weary, Recently one readily con
sented to plead guilty and pay a fine of
$50. He said he was ready to quit the
business, as he had been "grafted on" for
all that he had made. < â  W

gamblers pay tribute are getting greedy
themselves, and have recently shown a
desire to play the wild hog in demanding
increased percentages. Even the saloon
keepers and the cigar men with a little
dice game on the side do not want to be
directed to sell only one brand of whisky,
one line of cigars and certain beer. The
big influential pull," if it gets too exacting,
will hear some loud squealing. Even the
prosperous gamblers and traders find 10
per cent a heavier tribute than they can
afford to pay.
EL DORADOS MAKE MERRY
A Successful Initial Party
Given by an Individual
Parlor.
Pretty Girls and Native Sons Pack
the Large Dancing Hall of the
. Â» New Building.
El Dorado Parlor No' 52, N. S. G.W., is
jubilant. It was the first individual parlor
to give a party at the new Native Sons'
Hall on Mason street, and the party was a
great success. â¢- There were more than
twice as many people present as at the
dedication ball and many of the costumes
were quite as elaborate. '.'-.'
This ball has been looked forward to for
some time. It was to celebrate the eleventh
anniversary of the parlor, and nothing
had been overlooked that would conduce
to the pleasure or the guests. There were
regular reception committees, but each
member seemed to feel that the hall was
his and constituted himself a committee
of one to help every one else have a jolly
time. ;
-. Most of the ladies were in full evening
dress. There were pretty faces and figures
galore and quite as many elaborate gowns.
There were quite a number, however, who
wore house dresses. The same diversity
existed in the costuming of the gentle
men, but whether in evening coats or
business frock suits all seemed to have an
equally enjoyable time.
The grand march was not formed till
after 9 o'clock. The line extended more
than around the hall and more couples
were even then arriving, and when the
dancing began the hall was packed. There
was a â  pretty souvenir dance programme
on which .were fourteen dances and two
extras. Y.- ""-. '].';: .-â¢ â¢â¢'-â¢-, ,

Purple, white and pink hyacinths, La

illuminated the large room just enough to

The groom is the junior partner of the
firm or Ames & Harris, and although a
most successful and. popular business man,
has decided to give ; his attention .. to the
law, and will shortly enter the university
with that purpose in view.
Apple blossoms, sweet-scented eucalyp

read the impressive Catholic service. :
At 8:30 o'clock, the hour appointed for
the ceremony, the bridal party entered the
drawing-room, led by the two little nieces
of the, bride, Miss Ashley Turner and Miss
Gladys Louise Sullivan. Following them
came the bridesmaids, the Misses Louisa
and -Ada Sheehy. Then came the maid
of honor, Miss Georgia _. Sullivan, pre
ceding the bride, who entered leaning on
the arm of her brother, Frank J. Sullivan.
Edwin' Harris, brother of the groom, offi
ciated as best man.
After the ceremony congratulations were
iin order, and then there was dancing in
' the ballroom until 11 o'clock, when an
elaborate supper was served.
The 'bride, a dainty ; demi-blonde, with'
large violet eyes and a wealth of nut-brown
hair, wore a magnificent gown of: cream
white satin. The jupe was made en train
and the corsage trimmed with an exquis
ite bertha of point applique that had be
longed to the bride's mother. -
A bridal veil fastened to. the coiffure by
a diamond crescent, the gift of the groom,
completed the magnificent costume. The
bridal bouquet was of Kaiserine Augusta
roses and lilies of the valley.
. Miss Georgia. Sullivan, the maid of
honor, wore a very handsome gown of
light blue brocade trimmed with lace em
broidered in seed" pearls, and carried"; a'
bouquet of American ; Beauty roses and

The contest over the will of Louis J.
Ruffino was before Judge Coffey and a jury
yesterday. :' ; r ;- r . . - â '.:â¢-.- .:' :
Ruffino left an estate valued at about
$50,000, mostly to .Kate . Sauffer, who
claimed to be his wife. The sisters of the
testator are contesting on the ground of
undue influence and unsoundness of mind.
| The principal legatee claims to ; be Kate
Ruffino 'under; a -contract: marriage -'with
the deceased, contracted in ; 1883. The
contract was simply "We, the under
signed, agree to be husband and wife,"
and the names of the parties. This con
tract tis â  lost, the - widow says, and i there
was never anything more to show.the re
lationship which sue bore to the testator.
She-said upon the stand that he had often
proposed ' a r^lieious ceremony, but : she
thought the contract was sufficient, and as
no religious ceremony was ever performed.
There was more testimony from various
witnesses showing Ruffino had referred to
the' widow as his wife. There was, also
testimony to show that he was addicted to
strong 'â  drink, and the ; evidence ; having
reached that point, the case was continued

ARRAIGNED JOE O'CONNOR
School : Director Henderson's
I Charges Against- a
Principal.
HIS METHODS ARE QUESTIONED.
The Reduction of Janitors' Salaries
Laid Overâ Committee ,
Reports.
School Director Henderson exploded a
bombshell at the meeting of the Board of
Education last evening when resolutions
were called for. He made strong charges
against one of the oldest principals in the
department and tried to the best of his
ability to have the matter .considered with
out delay instead of having it sent to a
committee for investigation.
His charges were in printed form and
are as follows: .. ...
San Francisco, Cal.. Feb. 12. 1896.
To the Honorable Board of Education of the City
and County of San Francisco: I, H. C. Hender
son, a School Director for the City and County
of San Francisco, do hereby charge Joseph
O'Connor, the principal teacher of the Horace
Mann Grammar School, with a violation of the
rules of the Board of Education and with un
professional conduct as a teacher in this de
partment.
Firstâ l charge the said Joseph O'Connor
with a violation of the following rule of the
Board of Education, to wit, rule Ho. 31, which
reads as follows : - W
"Sec. 81. All modes of punishment calcu
lated to degrade a pupil, and' the use on the
part of any teacher of discourteous language
toward pupils or ; parents, are expressly for
bidden."
The said rule was violated and disobeyed by
the said Joseph O'Connor, on the 4th day of
February, 1896, in the schoolyard of the Hor
ace Mann Grammar School under the follow
ing circumstances:
... Certain of the pupils of said school were as
sembled for the purpose of receiving Instruc
tion in physical culture from and under
charge of the special teacher employed for that
purpose. . - ;V...
The exercises of the pupils were not satis
factory to the principal said, Joseph O'Cannor,
who witnessed the same from a'school window,
and in my hearing, although my presence in
the yard was unknown to him, he repioved
the pupils sharply, and in the course of his re
marks to them used the following language:
'.You have no better sense than Digger In
dians. You are a disgrace to the parents that
raised you." He then in a boisterous and un
dignified manner ordered the pupils; to their
rooms in the following words, "Git yez to yer
rooms," and while they were proceeding to
obey his instructions he stopped, them with
the word "halt," and then addressed to them
the following language: "For 2 cents I'd
give you a good bullyragging."
All of said : language was discourteous in the
extreme, tending to degrade the pupils to
whom it was addressed, and was of the charac
ter prohibited by rule 81 of this board.
Seconaâ l further, upon information and be
lief, charge and allege that the said Joseph
O'Connor is habitually unjust and arbitrary
in his methods of â¢ discipline, , coarse .- in his
language and boisterous and undignified in
his demeanor to his pupils, as ! a result of
which he fails to secure their respect, and has
thereby rendered < himself . liable to . be dis
missed from the School Department for un
professional conduct. â¢ â¢
v H. C. Henderson,
School Director for the City and County of
San Francisco. . j^Vy ;
A motion was made by Director Clinton
that the charges be referred to the Com
mittee on Rules, Director Henderson ob
jecting strongly.* He thought that the
charges should be considered at once.
Director Scott, . who presided, ruled the
immediate consideration of the charges
out of order and Director Clinton's mo
tion prevailed, the committee being in
structed to report at the next meeting.
The report of the Committee on Classifi
cation recommending that Miss M. M.
Wood, a probationary teacher, be elected
a regular teacher, was adopted.
- The Committee on Rules recommended
that the following teachers be granted
leave of absence: Miss Harriet E.,Worden,
from February 14, 1896, to March 14, 1896;
Miss Em el ia Calisher. from February 17,
1896, to February 17, 1898. /,
The Committee on Judiciary recom
mended that the. rent of the Post-street
school property, now occupied by Max
Popper and J. J. Flynu, be continued at
$600 per month for the ensuing year.
The Committee on Classification re
ported in favor of the , following changes:
Miss M. A. Doughty, relieved by reason of
consolidation of classes, was assigned to a
vacant place in the Emerson Primary
School. , y'c ?-:"â¢ - .
A new receiving class was created in the
Columbia school, ; with Miss . Agnes M.
Quinn as teacher. ! Â "7"f: : ' ;
Director Henderson presented a reso
lution that was adopted, instructing the
contractors who built the concrete retain
ing bulkhead at the Korth Cosmopolitan
School to rebuild the same and do the work
in a manner satisfactory to the board. The
bulkhead was found after the late storm to
be giving way, and threatening to fall on
the pupils of the school. -
The Committee on Rules recommended
that the resolution ; offered by Director
Murdock at the last meeting be amended
as follows: ' " '
/" "Whenever it becomes necessary to tem
porarily retire a; teacher from any school
on account of a consolidation of classes
the . teacher to be retired shall be the one
of said school last elected into the depart
ment." .
The committee also recommended that
the number of substitutes carried on the
payroll at any one time : be limited to
thirty. The report was adopted.
v, Miss Catherine F, Riordan was elected
principal of the new school at Sunnyside
at a salary of $90 per month. â¢ - -"
The sum of $50 was appropriated to bring
the exhibit; of school drawing now at the
Atlanta Exposition to this City. â¢
! A vote of thanks was tendered Professor
Thomas P. Baily Jr. of the State Univer
sity for his Kindness in lecturing to the pu
pils and teachers of the public schools on
. a recent occasion, and a like vote was
passed, to : the principal, teachers and pu
pils, of the Mission > Grammar Scnool for
the music furnished on that occasion.
The report of the Committee on Salaries

partment was laid on the table.

HUGH CRAIG ON CABLES.
He Sets Forth the. vantages of Tele
graphic Communication With
- Hawaii. - ' v i
"Hugh Craig delivered last evening be
fore the California Geographical Society a
highly entertaining lecture on "The* H
awaiian Cable and Submarine Telegraphy."
He told in ; brief how the cables of -the
world had been started from the main
land and just* what number had been fail
ures and successes. * He stated that at the
present day there were -twelve cable lines
across the Atlantic Ocean. r
*: â¢ "In 1854," he said, "it required ' forty
five seconds to drive a message across that
ocean, and "in 1895 -a f message was sent
from New. York ; to London in five sec
onds." ; * '"'." -.'.' ..".."â¢;'
--:';â ,-Mr. ' Craig ; explained by \ stereopticon
views the "manner" of ; sinking cables from
steamships and said that naval; men -have
got things down to such a nicety that they
think nothing of dropping the end of a
cable in 1500 fathoms of water and then on
the return voyage striking the identical
spot in the ocean and recovering it.
: 'j; He ;'! described ii,tbe"'i,' submarine : survey
"made by Admiral Belknap from San Fran
cisco to Japan * in 11874,- on which occasion
the ; sounding-line"? broke * a short distance
from Yeddo. Â£ Commander, 1 Tanner in 1891
went out with the ' ; Albatross forty miles
j south of the course taken by Belknap and
found a favorable path for the laying of a
cable. On the strength of these two voy
ages the cable question has become much
more agitated. ;; v â '*'',;
"If a cable could be laid to Hawaii,"
continued, Mr. Craig,', "in short time,
doubtless, France would connect from
New Zealand and Japan from Yeddo.
"In case of war the advantage of a cable
of our own can be readily, perceived. -If a
foreign nation | had possession of the line
and it was necessary to communicate with
our fleet in the mid-Pacific, a refusal on
that nation's part .' to " send the' message
might be a serious thing."
DEPOSITORS TO ACT.
Home Savings .Bank Directors to Come
Under Their Criticism.
Arrangement have been made for the
calling of a mass-meeting of the deposit
ors of the People's Home Savings Bank of
unhappy memory. The depositors have
organized themselves into an association,
which has held numerous meetings for, the
purpose of devising means for protecting
the interests of its members, who are said
to number about 2000. The executive
committee announces that at the coming
meeting, which will take place at an early
date, . the present management of the
bank -will be thoroughly discussed and
some interesting revelations as to its op
erations are promised. "
The action of the board of directors in
favoring M. H. Sherman, M. E. Collins
and a -number of others involved by al
lowing them extensions of time in the
legal proceedings against them at present
pending, will be severely criticized. The
depositors are also much disturbed in
view of the anticipated withdrawal of At
torney John ; Flournoy from further con
nection with the association, as his defec
tion is liable, in their opinion, to seriously
jeopardize their interests. The date of
the proposed meeting has not yet been as
signed, but it will , probably be called
during the course of next week. '*>"â¢;
PLUCKY MRS. E.J.FENTON
Her Timely Discovery Leads to
. the Arrest of a Bur
glar.
He Was Ransacking the Bureau
Drawers in a Bedroom in Her
Mother's House.
Several daylight burglars and sneak
thieves have been operating recently in
the Mission, and complaints to the police
have .in consequence been numerous.
.Yesterday a young man who gave . his
name -as Charles Wagner was cleverly
captured by Policeman E. J. Thompson
after a long chase, and there is reason to
believe that he has committed most of the
thefts.
Yesterday morning Wagner visited the
residence of Mrs. E. J. Fenton, 1747 Mis
sion street. He opened the front doer and
walked upstairs. Mrs. Fenton saw him
and asked what he wanted. He inquired
if a Mr. Whitener lived there and was
told that he did, but that he was not in.
Instead of going away Wagner sneaked
into a bedroom, where he was discovered
a few minutes later by Lilly Fenton, Mrs.
Fenton's daughter, searching through the
bureau drawers. *
"What are you doing there?" she asked.
"I am Mr. Whitener," said Wagner, and
before the young lady had recovered from
her astonishment he rushed past her and
downstairs. ' i".;;, ' .-.;*/
She gave the alarm and one of the room
ers started in pursuit of Wagner. As the
roomer was running along he overtook
Policeman Thompson, and pointing to
Wagner's fleeing figure he hurriedly told
him. what had occurred. Thompson
promptly joined in the chase and suc
ceeded in catching up with Wagner after
running several blocks.
Wagner was taken to the Seventeenth
street station and then to the City Prison.
On being searched a gold hairpin and
breastpin, which he ; had stolen from the
bureau drawers, were found in his pock
ets, and he was booked for burglary.

Paderewski Manager Sued on
a Long-Standing Ac
count.
THE PIANIST WELL APPEAR..
G. Verdier _ Co. Put the Musical
Man to Considerable Incon
venience.
Hugo Goerlitz, manager of .Paderewski,
the great pianist, was arrested yesterday
on an order from the Justice courts, is
sued on the affidavit of G. Verdier <fe Co.,
and was compelled to put up $600 cash bail
for his appearance in court, in spite of the
fact that he offered, through his attorneys,
Shortridge & Delmas, to pay the original
debt, less the interest, when the bill was
presented to him.
' Fifteen years ago, to be exact, on April
1879, the wife of Mr. Goerlitz entered
into a contract with a theatrical manager
to produce "Pinafore" in this City. The
promoter of the enterprise agreed with G.
Verdier & Co., who furnished the cos
tumes, to pay for the same, but when the
company went to pieces the goods were
unpaid â¢ for and the firm attached the
properties of the actors and actresses, sell
ing the same to satisfy the debt.
' Soon afterward Mr. and Mrs. Goerlitz,
who had lost their all in the failure of the
I company, departed for the East, the hus
band earning their passage and living en
route by obtaining jobs at bill-posting im
the various towns where they stopped.
Mr. Goerlitz did not see San "Francisco
again until he arrived with the musical
Pole, and Verdier & Co. hearing of his re
turn prepared to squeeze the~money out
of him by the most approved methods.
Knowing that any delay or failure to fulfill
his engagements would cost the manager
thousands of dollars, the dry-goods men
decided to have him taken into custody on
a warrant charging that he was about to
depart from the jurisdiction of the court
and that he was attempting to defraud his
creditors. M/ -
Previous to swearing out the warrant,
the bili, which was for $251 55, principal
and interest, was presented to Goerlitz and
he agreed to pay the principal, but refused
to settle the interest, referring Verdier &
Co. to Delmas â Shortridge, his attorneys.
In their presence a tender was made of
the $251 55, but the firm refused to accept,
if Then the dry-goods men went before
Justice Kerrigan and swore out the war
rant of arrest, alleging that Goerlitz -was
to leave the State within ten days and
that unless he put up a cash bail of $600 or
a bond of $1000 the firm would be de
frauded. Mr. Goerlitz promptly produced
the necessary $600, which is more than
twice the amount of the principal of the
claim or the amount over which the Jus
tices' Court. has jurisdiction, and more
than the principal and interest combined.
Justice Kerrigan consented to issue the
warrant on the representation of the plain
iffs' attorneys that inasmuch as Goerlitz
had been out of the State during the pe
riod since the bill was contracted and the
present, the statute of limitations does not
operate on the claim. :. '<
The case will be hotly contested, as Del
mas & Shortridge have advised their client
that he is liable for nothing in . con
nection with the matter and that his cash
deposit, put up at the time of the arrest, is
ample to cover all the necessities of the
case. '"' 'â¢ "' ' -/' "â  â¢â â â <â â 
Mr. Goerlitz and his attorneys look upon
the manner in which- Verdier & Co. have
handled the matter as a pure piece of per
secution. In spite of the fact that Mr.
Goerlitz has shown every inclination to
submit the matter to the courts, and has
put up a cash bond more than ample to
cover any judgment that may be given
against him, he has been served with an
order of examination, compelling him to
appear before the court this morning and
answer questions relating to his ability to
pay his bill. Not only has Goerlitz been
compelled to go to the inconvenience of
visiting the new City Hall, but Pade
rewski has been subpenaed to appear to tell
what he knows about his manager's
finances, and the box-office at the Califor
nia Theater has been attached.
The examination is set for 10 o'clock this
morning. _______________

It is not surprising to learn that the un

district is due to the fact that the Southern

in San Francisco it is nearly-always found
that the monopoly is back of it.

THE BRITISH VIEW.-
To the American people the most inter
esting portions of the debate in Parliament
on the Queen's speech are naturally enough
those relating to the Venezuelan contro
versy and the part the "United States has
played in it. . It is pleasing to note more
over that 'by no, one was our ; interfer
ence denounced. : Both the Government
and the opposition speakers frankly de
clared j their "willingness to have our Gov
| ernment assist in the settlement of the
| long-protracted dispute, and even Lord
Salisbury said it .was as natural for the
United States to take an interest in the
affairs of Venezuela as for England to be
interested in those of Holland and Bel
gium. :â '..â '.'â 'â â .â ;.Â«.'.'â¢â â â â â¢â  . *â  "â¢â "â  ''â¢ .
Through the debates both in the Lords
and the Commons, however, there runs
the suggestion of an idea quite different
from that which the American people
have on the subject. This appears quite
clearly when comparing the speech made
by Rosebery or Balfour in Parliament
with that made by Blancbard in Congress
on the same day. The American Senator
saw in the affair no more ; than a warning
to European nations that they could not
commit aggressions on American soil, but
Kosebery claimed to see in it a guarantee
on the part of the United States of the
permanence of any settlement that might
be arrived at, while Balfour declared amid
cheers that as a result of our mediation
and their acceptance "a permanent guar
antee of the good will of an English
speaking people will have been obtained
for all time."
From a reading of the whole debate it ap
pears that most British statesmen think we
are going to arbitrate South American af
fairs with them ; that we will undertake the
settlement of the whole dispute with Vene
zuela and will guarantee that Venezuela
shall conform to whatever is decided.
Now, as a matter of fact, we propose sim
ply to draw a boundary line and to de
clare where British Guiana ends and Vene
zuela begins. Only one speaker in Parlia
ment seems to have had a clear idea of
the true condition of affairs, and . that
naturally enough was Lord Salisbury.
That astute old statesman did not gush
over uniestricted arbitration like the
! younger speakers around him. He de-
I clared himself opposed to any arbitration
that might hand over 40,000 British sub
jects to Venezuela, and favored what he
called a "policy of arbitration and nego
tiation combined." ' V. j
It will be seen that while we derive sat
isfaction from the glowing professions of
friendship on the part of so many parlia
mentary orators, we must not regard the
Venezuelan affair as wholly settled. The
British have got to learn that we are not
offering them an alliance nor favoring the
arbitration of everything in sight. There
is no danger of war, but there is a good
deal of negotiation to be carried on yet
between England and Venezuela, while
our task consists simply in drawing a line
and.' saying to the British, Thus far shalt
thou go and no farther.
SIDEWALKS TOO WIDE.
The cheerfulness with which the prop
erty-owners along Lombard street agreed
to the proposition to reduce the width of
the walks in order to widen the driveway
in its establishment as a boulevard is ex
plained by a petition which the residents
of the Richmond district have filed with ;
the Board of Supervisors for the reduction j
of the width of the walks on . certain
streets In that section, and both of these
incidents are sufficient to call, attention to
the general fact that the sidewalks in the
newer parts of the City are entirely, too
wide. d) / â  '
That 13 to say, the sidewalks are too
wide in proportion to the width of the
driveway. A street seventy feet wide, for
instance, will have fifteen-foot sidewalks,
leaving forty feet for the driveway and
giving thirty to the sidewalks. In some
cases even a greater proportion goes to the
sidewalks. -;-*"/ '*'â¢â ': ':'.'.-..
The question of convenience is the only
one that can rationally be considered in
this matter. On Montgomery or Kearny
street, where at certain times of the day
the walks are pretty well filled, it would
be reasonable to have walks fifteen feet
wide, but in the residence parts of the
City such a provision .is absurd. The
system under which our streets were laid
out seems utterly to have ignored the pos
sible advent of streetcar lines, which
necessarily take considerable space that
otherwise might be used by wagons, thus
greatly reducing the usable width of the
driveway without affecting that of the
"sidewalk.
It is far more essential to have abundant
free room in the driveway than on the
walks, for human beings run no risks of
collisions or blockades. Again streets in
San Francisco, by reason of the wretched
methods of paving which are prevalent,
are frequently torn up for repairs while
walks are not, and this fact serves further
to embarrass vehicular traffic.
Most of the sidewalks in the residence
parts of town are nearly twice as wide as
they should be in order for the streets to
subserve their highest usefulness, and the
improvement' clubs which are aiming to
upbuild the various sections in which they
work might give profitable heed to the
subject. Of course there is hardly need to
call attention to the matter of cost in con
structing sidewalks. .
The case of Lombard street illustrates
the whole subject. The property-owners,
recognizing the fact that the making of
their* street into a boulevard would in
crease travel and thus make a wider drive
way necessary, ' cheerfully agreed to a
' proposition that would benefit their prop
erty and increase the carrying capacity of
the street. That is the entire subject in
small compass. _ .
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE.
. . The San Jose Herald, in an able analysis i
of the hydraulic â  mining probfem, while
recognizing the Â£. principle of restraining
dams as", a feasible engineering achieve
ment, takes the ground that Government
assistance in their construction would not
be good policy, and that arguments in sup
port of such assistance "ignore constitu
tional-limitations and sound pol itical
science." For instance, it asserts that while
; the output from a year's crop of hen s' eggs
is twice as j great ias that from hydraulic
mining this furnishes no reason for the
construction of chicken-coops by the Gov
ern en >^^^SHSBB__i
! We had supposed that a very important
function of Government is a reasonable
encouragement of important industries af
fecting the welfare â¢of the whole country;
provided such encouragement is necessary.
It is upon that principle that the llepubli
can idea of protective tariff is founded.
Hydraulic mining and- hens' .""' eggs :.'â  are
hardly parallel cases, for mining â¢ by the
hydraulic process { has - been actually pro
hibited; by legislation, except under very
burdensome conditions â conditions so
burdensome as f practically to make - the
prosecution of the industry impossible in
* he . * absence ;, of . Government "... assistance.
That is not the case with ; hens' eggs.
Even though, as our â¢ contemporary de
clares, a rehabilitation of i hydraulic \min
ing by, means of Government assistance
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY' 13, 1896.
\ might, under our present single-standard
financial policy, result in the outflow to
.Europe *of ' the gold which we might pro
duce, the wealth represented by the pro
duction would not be . destroyed or de
ported. ether we sent ' the ; product to
Europe as gold or - any other commodity
of value equal to it we would receive an
equivalent in " return. Hydraulic mining
is desired as much for its ) wealth-produc
ing as its gold-producing results. ""
If it is the duty of the Government to
open interior waterways for traffic as, for
instance, the rivers of California that
might be made navigable by the employ
ment of Government funds in their open
ingâand thus establish better facilities
for the profitable conduct of agriculture,
it 'is equally its duty to make appropria- >
tions for the development of hydraulic
mining. _ The farmers in the valley of the
Sacramento cannot consistently support
one proposition to the [ exclusion of the
other. We understand their contention
to be not that Government assistance of
hydraulic mining is wrong in the aspect
of governmental fostering of an important
industry, but that the engineering
culties in the way are insurmountable;
that restraining dams are a physical im
possibility. This question must of course
be left to the decision of competent en
gineers, and that decision has been already
given to the effect that there is nothing in
the problom of impounding dams that
renders them either impossible, imprac
ticable or uneconomical. . ;'\"
A MARE'S BEST.
Our highly esteemed contemporary, the
Chronicle: thinks that in the recent state
ment of Mr. Maguire concerning the inter
est of the Goulds and Vanderbiits in the
fight against the refunding scheme it has
discovered evidences of a conspiracy in the
interests of the monopoly. This conspir
acy it calls a "Vanderbilt-Huntington-
Hoke Smith-Thurston combination," and
argues that everybody who is opposed to
Government ownership and operation of
the roads is playing into the hands of the
conspirators and either intentionally or
ignorantly is betraying the real interests
of the people.
â¢ The opinion of the Chronicle is worthy of
passing consideration. It is . a familiar
proverb that "lookers-on see most of the
game," and certainly in this affair the
Chronicle has been a looker-on. It has
taken no part in the fight. We are con
vinced, however, that despite the wisdom
of the old proverb any one who gives
the subject the consideration it merits
will arrive at the conclusion that our
contemporary is mistaken. There is no
conspiracy in sight. That both the Goulds
and the Vanderbilts should desire to ex
tend their railway systems across the con
tinent is natural, and it is certain that if
either of them should succeed in doing so
we should then have a transcontinental
line in competition with the Southern Pa
cific. . ":
As for the assertion that those who are
opposing Government ownership and oper
ation of the railroads are "defying the
wishes of the people and working in the
interest of Vanderbilt, Gould and Hunt
ington for fun," it is hardly credible that
any large number of people should believe
it. even in the class that never stops to
think. To defeat the refunding scheme
and to. provide for the operation of the
Pacific roads by the Government are two
different propositions. Many who dis
agree on the latter are united on the former,
and it is because of that union that we
have now such good prospects .of defeat- j
ing the Huntington scheme and obtaining
at least a competing line. ,- . y . <_:â¢'...- : â¢ ... â 
The proposal to foreclose the mortgages
on the roads without undertaking Govern
ment ownership is not a new one. In the
report of the Pattison committee of 1886,
it is said : '
"There is only one course open to Con
gress and that is the immediate winding
up of the affairs of all the companies, en
abling the- Government to withdraw at
once from all connection with the running
of railroads, or sharing in the profits of
their management. There ought to be an
end to the partnership between the Gov
ernment and the Pacific railroads; a
speedy and absolute divorce." -'v.
This "speedy and absolute divorce" of
the Government from the railroads is â¢
what, many people desire to see, and they
will be surprised to learn they are sus
pected of "working in the interests of a
conspiracy." We see no danger ahead in
the desire of the Vanderbiits and Goulds
to get control of the roads. They are well
able to bid against one another, and if
either should win we shall obtain posses
sion of a competing line. Moreover, we
would have the - satisfaction of knowing
the Government had not compounded a
fraud, but bad'en forced the law aeainst a
rich and powerful corporation exactly as
it would - have â  enforced it against the
poorest citizen.

phens. His success was a surprise, as for the
last few years he has modestly; avoided all
drawing-room popularity and has passed his
time in quietly preparing himself for his debut.'
The Musical Courier says: "On Monday even-,
ing vhe â¢, mounted the stage an untried
and .' unknown pianist. Tuesday's Figaro,
Gaulois, Monde Musical and New York Herald
announce the immense success of an American
pianist, whose appearance had already placed
him high on the road to fame. One hears much
nowadays of temperament and , sympathetic
personality. Perhaps not a little of Stefanski's
success is due to. these attributes. Poetry of
sentiment, refinement and delicacy of concep
tion are salient characteristics of the young
man's playing. No one seems to know whether
he anticipates an American debut in the near
future. I hope.so, and it surely will not be a
case of the prophet in his own land."
Varri â â â  Stefanski was "discovered," so to
speak; by William Sherwood some years asm.
The boy, who was passionately fond of music,
had no idea of making it his career, but he
went by chance into Chickering Hall one day
and heard Sherwood was in the building. Fol
lowing a sudden impulse he ascended to the
artist's studio and ingeniously introduced
himself, saying, "Some one told me you were
here, Mr. Sherwood, and I have come to beg
you to play for me." Sherwood laughed in j
open amusement, and suggested that his vis
itor set the â¢ ball rolling. "I studied the piano
for a time, but I have given it up entirely/
said Stephens. After some demurring he
seated himself at the piano and began a Cnopin
nocturne. "Young man, you are making the
mistake of your life in not devoting yourself
to an artistic career; with your talent it is
wrong," said Sherwood after hearing his vis
itor play. It was this advice* which caused
Stephens to study seriously, and the result
has justified Sherwood's prediction.
A â  feeling of profound horror tinged with
pity has been aroused in Wagnerian circles,
by the conduct of the dilettanti of Rome. At
the Argentina Theater they are playing the
"Valkyrie," as much in the Bayreuth style as
possible, and this includes darkness in the
auditorium while the opera is in progress. A
number of the subscribers have addressed a
letter to the papers expressing a strong desire
to put an end to this obscurity. These | phil
i6tines claim "that, according to the laws of
nature, darkness far from awakening the in
telligence tends to lull it to sleep." They de
mand with instance "un po'di luce" (a little
light). But even the sacrilegious request of
the Argentina subscribers pales beside the
conduct of the students of the â¢ University of
Turin, who are preparing a parody on the
poem and music of "The Dusk of the Gods."
The horror of the thing is arousing indignant
editorial comment in the French papers ; and
yet there was a timeâ but the Parisians do not
like to be reminded that there ever was a
time when they did not bow the knee before
Wagner. â , " . . . -'
An incidwit considers to be without prece
dent In-.-; Berlin happened at the last royal
chapel concert. The entertainment was di
rected by the first violin, Herr Halir, and al
though everything went off in the most satis
factory manner, the subscribers and the pub
lic generally have expressed great indigna
tion at being subjected to the conducting "of
so little a man.' The incident happened in this
wise: Weingartner, the chef d'orchestre, had
hurt his hand and could not hold the baton;
Sucher, his understudy, was suffering from an
attack of la grippe ; and Muck, the third chef
d'orchestre, had obtained \ leave of absence to
direct a concert at Budadest. The two con
ductors for minor operas and the ballet dared
not risk the enterprise, and the first violin
courageously offered himself. â '.â¢*'- 1-.-~

The City has secured judgment in the

property in the Potrero which has been in
litigation for many years.
The property .in . question includes a
street in the vicinity of Seventh and Chan
nel streets which - the City had surveyed,
and over which : suit 1 to quiet title was
brought by Buckley. The land was orig
inally acquired from the State, ; which,
having ascertained to its own satisfaction
the limits of the old Puebla grant, sold the
tide lands' adjoining. It was afterward
found - that . the Puebla ; lands extended
down much further than was at first sup
posed, including, in fact, much of the
land which the State had sold. The con
flicting titles over the lands thus doubly
Qwnednave caused a great many law suits,
among them the suit just ; decided;, the
point of -all being the rights of those who

ANOTHER CUSTOM
HOUSE SCANDAL.
Sixteen Chinese Women
Unlawfully Landed at
This Port.
OFFICIALS ARE ACCUSED.
Inspectors Said to Have Re

THE CASE AGAINST WILLIAMS.
Treasury Agent Moore Hot on the
Trail of the Suspects in the .
Gigantic Swindle.
There is another scandal brewing in Cus
tom-house circles. It is the result of
wholesale charges of landing Chinese
women for immoral purposes, and made
by agents >ot the United States Treasury
against certain customs inspectors and.
other officials in high standing. These
charges have been filed with the Secretary
of the Treasury at "Washington, and it is
expected that the accused persons will be
put on the rack at once. ' Special ' Agent
Moore is not on their trail, and while he is
silent as to his course of action In the
matter, it is known that he is in possession
of damaging information against inspec
tors, apart from Williams. ' ' ;
It is known that within the last* three
months sixteen Chinese woman have been
landed, in San Francisco on the ground that
they were native daughters of the State.
All these women are now inmates of dis
reputable houses in Chinatown. The
declaration is made that they are all na
tives of China and were brought here by
those engaged in the traffic for the special
purpose in which they" are now employed
These women were landed from the
regular incoming Chinese steamers and
landed on certificates sworn out by
Chinese witnesses and passed through
connivance of certain Customs-house
authorities. The majority of the young
women were assigned to Lee Gee and Lee
Hoy and a few went to "Little Fete." .
The latter was greatly annoyed because
of the unequal division of the fair daugh
ters from the Orient, and finally quarreled
with his rivals in the business. Conse
quently the Chinamen, having disagreed
among themselves, talked quite freely
with outsiders regarding the importing of
the girls. In this way it leaked out that
$500 had been paid the Custom-home
rin g for the landing of each girl, or $8000
in all. These are the facts now in the pos
session of the United States Treasury De
par tment, and interesting developments
are promised at an early date.
There is much speculation about the
Federal building as to who the accused
persons are. The fact that Chinese Inter
preter Williams is charged with almost
everything on the â¢ calendar in respect to
the landing of Chinese women for ques
tionable purposes â¢is generally known.
Special Agent-Moore made, the complaint
against him. The case is now before the
Government authorities at Washington.
Wong Sam, who was the chief witness
aeainst Williams,- was arrested on -com
plaint of a Chinese woman named. Dong
I Sun Yet, who deposes that Wong Sam,
j Toy Duck and Ah Ling brought her here
from China last fall and placed her in a i
den in the Chinese quarter. *â¢"'.,.
The woman declares she is a native of
China. The strange feature of this case is
that Williams and others in the service
knew the facts of the unlawful landing of
the girl months ago, but took no action in
the matter. She was taken from the den
by the missionaries and given a chance to
reform. She embraced the . opportunity
and is now leading a respectable existence.
In regard to the arrest of Wong Sam
United States District Attorney Foote
feels as though he had been imposed upon.
Had he known that there was an investi
gation pending in which the Chinese was
the principal witness he would never have
sanctioned his arrest. As it is, when the
facts of the case were explained to him he
at once went before United States Com
missioner Heacock and had the man re
leased on $250 bail. "No one in the Dis
trict Attorney's office will talk, buf it is
pretty well known in the Federal building
that District Attorney Foote will â¢ recom
mend the dismissal of the charge and that
the Attorney-General will follow his
advice. >'.\ . , ..: _ .
According to a gentleman well versed in
. the case, the charges against Wong Sam
are five months old. All the facts have
been in' the possession of Collector Wise
for half &' year, but, it was only when
charges were preferred against Interpreter
R. Williams by the said Wong Sam that the
charges were raked up and used. L It is this
fact that has made the United States Dis
trict Attorney angry, iÂ»nd the communica
tions between his office and that of the
Collector yesterday were anything but ami
cable. " . "'â "'.".'.' J;" â  .'- '- ' -" - " 'â -: .-'.': : ; .'â¢
Whether Wong Sam comes to trial or
not. there is. -thing certain, his case
will not be heard for several weeks. '
The scandal that has been brewing in
the Custom-house for months is about to
get an airing, and the Chinese will have
many things to tell about the landing of
Chinese women that will interest the Fed
eral authorities, special Agent of the
Treasury Moore and â¢ District ; Attorney
Foote are keeping the wires â  hot with dis
patches to Washington,' and an investiga
tion, in which two special agents now on
the way here will play an important part,
will soon be under way. â¢ ,- â¢

THE POOR WITH US.
H. H. Powers Declares That This Con
dition Can Be; Alleviated, but
Not Overcome.
"Poverty cannot be abolished, but it can
be lessened. to an appreciable extent."
This was the epitome of | a lecture on the
"Abolition of Poverty," delivered at the
Academy of Sciences Hall before the Stan
; ford University Extension Club last night
j by Harry Huntington Powers, the head of
the department of economics at Palo Alto.
; The lecture was listened to with close in
' terest by a large audience. . ;:->.. ' . ', ,i
I Mr. Powers first looked at the function
of poverty. This, he said -was given espe
cial attention by the ancient philosophers.
They looked upon poverty as essential to
effecting the cohesion of social organiza
tion. It was therefore considered of social
value. Later Â£ poverty, v especially â¢ volun
tary poverty, was looked upon by the
Christian philosophers as honorable. This
is shown in the teachings of the Bible.
Then charity, unreasoning charity, came
next in the grade of honor. _ \ : - ;
.With the progress of thought and r the
growth of theory of evolution came the
idea that poverty was a product of society
and not of nature. Poverty' has come to
be considered a disgrace and ; unthinking
charity : little more than a crime. The
world had decided that men were- not en
titled to a living, but that they had a right
to such a share of the 'gifts of society, as
"their quickness and ability will enable
them to take. Those failed through
lack of favorable circumstances deserved
help. â :â .-â¢â¢'â _ .:_--â :â  'â¢'.-; .â â¢',.â :-.;'.:. '; v . 'â¢..'.-!

thatÂ»might tend to minimize poverty. He
favored the suppression of undesirable re
production and the easing of the pangs of
dissolution. He concluded:
"Don't give to. tramps. Don't give to
any one you don't know. Don't give
money unless you are sure the recipient is
competent to expend it propefly. Don't
give to children." â¢
Then he urged as a "do" that each per
son should assist some one worthy case
and help in organizations to investigate
others.

Hudson, professor of English at Stanford
University; will deliver a lecture on "So
cial Aspect of Conduct" at the same place.
LOSS OF THE NINEVEH
Captain Broadfoot and His I Men
Exonerated ; by a Naval
; Court.
The Stanch Old Ship Was Founderine
in a Gale When Abandoned
Off Cape Flattery.
A naval court of inquiry was held yes
terday at- the â â ; British consulate in 1 this
City to investigate the circumstances at
tending the s abandonment .of the ' British
ship Nineveh of Sydney off : Cape Flattery.
The conduct of her captain, certified
mate, second mate and crew in connection
with leaving the vessel at sea was ; also in
quired into, and the result was a complete
exoneration of the officers and men.
The Nineveh was . a wooden vessel, ship
rigged, 1174 tons register, built in Scotland
in 1864, and she "â  had j battled with the seas
for thirty-two years. ; ; On her fatal voyage
she left Moody ville, 8.C.; for Sydney with
a cargo of lumber and 300 tons of ballast
January 15. Her crew . consisted of eigh
teen hands. * ..-
According * to : the * evidence ; yesterday ,
soon after putting out for sea the Nineveh
encountered 'threatening weather and the
captain made for ' Port Angeles, "Wash.,
January 16. "He was detained there by the
storms -till January 22, when he left. Lit
tle headway had' been made, however, be
fore it was necessary to cast anchor, and
lie in shelter for two days. ; January 24 the
Nineveh proceeded to sea and passed Cape
Flattery in the afternoon when a gale was
blowing. - Then ; the' stanch | old' ship was
pitchea about, and listed under terrific
broadside seas.; In this* condition she
made water- and continued to leak badly.*
Men were put to work on the pumps,' but
were washed ; away ? repeatedly by j waves
breaking over the decks. In [ this extrem
ity I Captain -Broadfoot started the pump
ing engines,* which were powerless in low
ering the water in the , vessel, and at f last
the â¢ ship began :to founder. >It was then
that the captain determined to abandon
her. â :.'i->- 1! -v. i V"',^''- : V.' 'â¢;.'.-''. â  â¢â ": '-- : : 'â¢ â â¢ ' â -â  ":'â ''.

ALONG WATER FRONT
The British Ship Roderick Dhu*
Sold to an American V-
Syndicate.
TO RUN IN THE SUGAR TRADE.
More Trouble on the Revenue Cutter
Bear and Mutiny Is
Charged.
'_ , ; ''
The British ship Roderick Dhu will no
more -fly the house flag of the White Star
line, but after to-day the Hawaiian ensign
will be seen floating from her flagpole.
Williamson, Milligan & Co., the owers of
the vessel, have been anxious for some
time to get rid of her, as they want to con
fine their attention exclusively j to; ; steam â¢
boating. In consequence, all their sailing
vessels have been sold at a sacrifice, and
when Captain Matson, the y managing
owner of the Annie Johnson and Santiago,
saw his opportunity he at once closed the
deal. The vessel will run between here
and Hilo in the sugar trade. Between
seasons she will make an occasional trip
to Europe, Australia, South Africa or New
York, as the charter may offer. Her new
owners intend to keep her going all the
time, and expect to make her a paying in
vestment. ' â¢'
The Roderick Dhu is one of the finest
and best equipped ships in port. She is
now discharging the remainder of her
general cargo at Spear-street wharf, and
in spite of the general turmoil which ac
companies discharging she is as clean and
neat as a yacht. Captain -Howe takes
great pride in his ship, and while he is not
at all sorry to get back to' England he does
not like to see the' vessel '"which he has
navigated so many years living any other
flag than the British ensign. The Roder
ick Dhu has been a home, to him, and he
naturally docs not feel like tearing up all
his belongings and hauling down the house
flag. 7" . ..-..: .7.7,,... .77,
When the Roderick Dhu. goes under the
Hawaiian flag the chances are that Cap
tain Charles Rock will assume command.
He is one of the old-time masters and no
one knows better than he how to handle a
ship. If the present crew will remain by
the vessel they will' be reshipped, but the
chances are that many will desert as soon
as they ' know the Roderick Dhu;; has
changed hands. The name of the' vessel
may also be changed, but if Captain Mat
son has any weight in the matter the
name of the old Scotch Highland hero will
be retained.
As soon as the Roderick Dha's cargo is
discharged to-day the Hawaiian flag will
be run up . and the new . owners will for
mally take possession. ' While she will be
principally used Â»in the sugar trade, there
is ample accommodation for passengers
and better quarters could not be found on
a passenger steamer.*- Not many years ago
the vessel was ) in- the passenger trade be
tween England and Australia and in those
days fast passages were made. Her new
owners expect | her to make just as good
time between San Francisco and Hilo. 7 7^
There was more trouble on the j revenue

cipants. .Joseph Byrnes, one of the crew,

ordered him back and the sailor refused.

"all hands" were called. Still Byrnes was
not placed under arrest and Daniels rushed
aboard the cutter Perry and said there was
a mutiny on his vessel.. ; The officers got
their cutlasses on and a squad of men was
detailed, but when the Bear was reached
there was no Byrnes to be found.; He had
fled. 7 Later 'ons he I was 7 recaptured and
placed in irons, but the j chances; are that
he will be released to-day. Byrnes' friends

It is hard to pick apart her methods and

Her work is so natural, so unique as to

before they can think of finding flaws they
are cheering and applauding with the un
critical but delighted public. The.piece is
mignificenlly staged, the costumes, what

theater-goers even here, far removed
though we be from the tight little isle
which Richard ruled. Mr. Keene looks
and acts his best in the part, which, he
seems to have made peculiarly his own.
It is to be regretted that his support is not
a little " more worthy ' of ' him, but f then,
nowadays one must not be too exacting.
Anyhow, Keene is worth seeing for him

to anyone else. _^ . , . .

. "The Gentle Savage," as The Call pre
dicted, is having a second week, and a
very brilliant one at that. The amusing
anachronisms of which, it might almost
be said, the piece is made up are charming
in their naive .disregard of : all .the canons
of time and history. The jokes, though a
few have a slight flavor of yesterday's muf
fins, are for the most part new, while the
songs and dances are charming.
"Der Freischulz" is announced for next
week. The opera has been. carefully 're
hearsed, and the incantation scene will, it
is said, surpass anything in the spectacu
lar line yet seen in the Tivoli. Ida
Valerga and Kate Marchi will reappear in
prominent roles, so there is reason to look
for some of the fine execution and finished
operatic style which made their singing
much admired in days gone by.

TESTING THE FAIR TRUST
An Effort to Extend Judge
Slack's Recent De
cision.
BABY OELEICHS' LEGAL BIGHTS.
Important . Points in the Great Will
Case Brought Out on a
Demurrer.
The Fair will case bids fair to take up
Judge Slack's spare hours for some time to
come.' The array of attorneys and the in
tricacy of the barristerial maneuvers would
seem at times to confuse even the judicial
mind, and on Monday his Honor read off
the notes on his calendar in presence of
the lawyers in order to make sure that he
and they knew "where they were at." He !
then appointed yesterday as the time for
the hearing of the demurrer presented by
Charles S. Wheeler, attorney for the chil
dren of the late Senator. >V'v.iA
Mr. Wheeler was on hand bright and
early with about half a- ton of lawbooks,
and as ; soon as the proceedings opened
commenced his argument. Ex-Judge Van
R. Paterson, the guardian ad litem of
little Herman Oelrichs, was an interested
listener. The Fair children's proposed
demurrer is against the contest which
Baby Oelricbs has entered through his at
torney to the probate of the will of Sep
tember 24, the last or the "lead-pencil"
will, as it is called.
An important point is . involved in the
contention of Theresa Fair-Oelrichs' first
born. He would be a direct beneficiary
under the will of September 23, by which
the trust was created. The trust has been,
it is true, set aside so far as the real prop
erty of the testator goes, but, as this repre
sents less than a third of the entire estate,
the child's interest is still a very important
one. The lead-pencil will has no mention
of a trust, and. in case it is declared
genuine and allowed to take precedence
over the will of the preceding day, in
which the trust is created, the dead Sena
tor's grandchild | will cease to have any
status in the case as a legatee. His inter
est stands or falls with the trust, which is
still assumed to be valid, so far as the per
sonal property of his grandfather is con
cerned. Hence his guardian ad litem
filed an application in the baby litigant's
name protesting against the admission of
the lead-pencil will to probate, and also
against its recognition as a valid instru- ,
ment. To this action of- the legal sponsor
of Herman Oelrichs Jr.* the Fair children
, demur. '. ' " -.""*","â¢â¢.
' Mr. Wheeler commenced his : argument
by assuming that the trust should be de
clared invalid, not alone as to the realty,
but as to the, personal property as well.
He cited parts of the will of September 23
to prove that Senator Fair- intended that
the personal property of his estate should
be used by his executors or trustees to im
prove the realty. and enhance its value.
In this connection he said the inquiry sug
gested itself whether the trust was or was
not an - essential part of .th testator's
scheme for the disposal of 'hi â property,
and also whether tne setting aside of the
trust, so far as the realty of the estate was
concerned, would or would not be tanta
mount to a practical setting at naught of
the testator's expressed intention, in other
words an actual breaking of the will. He
characterized the dispositions of the will
of September 24 as fanciful and capricious
in the extreme, and cited a number of
eminent authorities in support of his view.
Mr. Paterson asked for a copy of Mr.
Wheeler's argument, which was "promised
hifa Â°as soon as it might jbe transcribed '
from the reporter's notes, and he was
given ten days in which to file his answer
to the demurrer.
The demurrer of the Fair children to
Baby Oelrichs' opposition to the , probate
of the "pencil will" is based upon the sup
position that he has no | interest in the
estate whatever. By Judge Slack's recent
decision he has no interest in' the real
Eroperty, but the demurrer alleges that he
as no interest at all, and so his claims
upon the personal property, under the
trust, at once come in question. In other
words, by. alleging that he. as beneficiary
under the trust, has no interest whatever,
the questions not passed upon in Judge
Slack's recent decision are at once brought

JURORS AGAINST
THE COURT
They Rebel Against the |
Instructions of Judge
Daingerfield.
VERY STRONG AFFIDAVIT
Compelled to Return a Verdict
Against Their Con- '
victions.
THEY ASK A NEW HEARING.
It All Comes Out of a Case. in Which
Money-Lender Asa Fisk Is
the Plaintiff.
Eugene N. Deuprey has obtained the
signatures of twelve irate jurymen who !
declare their sovereignty. They are chaf
ing over the instructions of Judge Dain
gerfield which compelled them to bring in
a verdict entirely disaccordant with their
ideas in the case of Asa .Fisk against John
Mai lon.
The court, so they state in their affidavit
herewith given, was entirely at variance
with their ideas of the case, and it was
only the threat of being placed in con
tempt that made them relinquish their
rights as American citizens in the jury
box, to give a verdict according to their
own idea.
The Call has already published the
particulars of the case which has brought '
about this judicial scandal. Fisk loaned |
$200 in cash to John Hill, whose note was j
indorsed by Mallon. By devious means j
Mallon was made to pay $1200 to Fisk as
interest, and finally was worked into in- i
dorsing a note as a renewal for $200, which
subsequently turned out to be a note for
ten times that amount.
But these details have already been pub
lished, as they have been'" fully stated to i
the jury. "
The affidavit in the case* however, is a,
new thing in the jurisprudence of this
country. It reads as follows:
In the Superior Court, City and County of
San Francisco.
Asa Fisk )
.vs. [

nan. Albert Folsom, Henry Klindt, Lawrence
W. Coe, O. P. James, Peter Kingen, J. A. Em
erson, being separately and individually
sworn deposes and says: That affiant was
sworn as one of the trial jurors to try the case :
a!oreentitled in the Superior Court for said j
<"ity and County of San .Francisco, Department
" thereof, and that the trial occupied the 30th
day of January and the 3d and days of
February, 1896; that the evidence on behalf j
of plaintiff and defendant, as presented and \
heard on said trial, satisfied the mind of yonr '
affiant that the defendant did not know or ;
understand that ho was assuming any lia
bility by placing his name on a paper that
â was introduced in evidence, viz. : the paper, ;
plaintiffs exhibit A being the alleged pro- i
missory note dated August 6, 1886, for the i
payment of the sum of $000 principal with in- i
terest thereon at the rate of 3 per cent per |
month, and if not paid in advance to be com- |
pounded monthly, and. the same to bear the
like rate of Interest of 3 per cent per month,
or in writing- his name to the alleged renewal
indorsed on the back of said paper, exhibit A,
ana your affiant was further satisfied that the
said exhibit A as submitted to the said jury
trying the above-entitled case was and is an
unlawful contract and against good morals;
that your affiant was and is further satisfied
that the plaintiff in the afore-entitled case took
an undue and unwarranted advantage of the de
fendant both by fraud and misrepresentations;
that your affiant was and is convinced and
satisfied that the plaintiff was not entitled
to recover in said afore-entitled action, but
that the verdict of your affiant as he desired to
render it was for the defendant and for his
costs, and your affiant verily believes that the
defendant was and is entitled to judgment
against plaintiff herein. That your affiant
wished and desired to make and render his
verdict, and would have done so, nevertheless
the instruction of the court, to bring in a ver
dict for plaintiff, were it not that affiant feared
that such action might have been construed
by the court "as an act of disrespect, and that
affiant would be called upon to answer why he
should not be punished for contempt of court ;
that in truth and in fact the verdict as now
entered and filed was not the verdict of your
affiant according to his view of the testimony
and his construction of the instrument upon
which plaintiff claims to recover."
That, on the. contrary, the verdict.of this af
fiant whs and is under the evidence that "I
hud lit favor of the. defendant and for his
costs." That the verdict now entered and
filed is such a verdict as affiant was forced to
give by reason of the positive demand and in
struction of the court, and was and is not the
verdict of this affiant under the evidence of
the witnesses who testified on the trial of the
case, and this affiant believes and is convinced
that the verdict now entered and riled should
be set aside and a verdict entered in favor of
defendant and for his costs.

"I cannot understand why Judge Dain
gerfield took the stand he did in this case,"
said Eugene Deuprey when seen about the
Fisk-Mallon matter yesterday. . "He is
ordinarily, and is acknowledged to be,"a
fair and unbiased representative of justice,
and, besides, our personal relations are of
the friendliest nature. 1 argued the case
in behalf of my client, Mallon, until the
jury retired with cast-iron instructions to
find a verdict against us. Then came a !
brief interval, at the conclusion of which
the jury sent word to Jndge Daingerfield
that they would like to know whether or {
not they had to abide by the \ instructions j
of the court or be allowed to construe the |
facts presented as I they found tbem to be. j
Knowing of this, - J- again remonstrated
with the Judge, but to no avail. - The only
satisfaction 1 got was that Judge Dainger
fieid told me in plain terms that he thought
he was v perfectly justified to give the in
structions he had given to the jury, and
that he would not accept any verdict con
trary to his ruling."
Speaking further on the general aspect
of the case Mr. Deuprey said that the law,
as- he understood it, allowed a Judge to
instruct juries to . find a verdict * for or
against defendant or plaintiff only cases
where there was one-sided evidence, with
out any contradictory facts from ' the' op
position. In this particular case, however,
there was abundant testimony for the de
fendant; who took the witness-stand him
self to give facts to the jury.- which, as the
affidavit signed by them shows, convinced
them that he was being falsely persecuted,
so these rulings certainly cannot be ap
plied. â  7 .: "â ' 7 â  ; 7 ' -â â  - 7 : '- r7-7
Mr. Mallon's attorney will, within the
limited time, file his application for a new
trial.with Judge Daingerfield. Â£ < ~...* 7
The application will be accompanied by
a counter-complaint asking for $25,000
damages. These damages,- Mallon claims,
were sustained on account of the stoppage
of his credit by the ; various banks with
which he did business, by the ; general dis
inclination of his many business associates
to credit him 'â â â  after the facts of i the 'Asa
Fisk case became known.
Should, however. Judge Daingerfield re
fuse to grant a rehearing of the case, in
spite of all the facts" calling for such an
action, the whole matter will go to the Su
preme Court on appeal.

HIS WIFE DESERTED HIM
Edward Lahue of Ukiah in the
City Searching for the
Runaway.
In His Absence She Left Home With
the Youngest Child for San
Francisco.
Edward Lahue, a well-to-do rancher liv
ing at Ukiah, is in this City searching for
his young wife, who ran away, from home
with his youngest daughter. He is almost
distracted with grief over bis wife's unac
countable action, and, as a ; last hope of
finding her and the child, has. applied? for
assistance Â»to-= General 7 McComb, secre
tary of the Society "for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children. ' f
The story Lahue toM Ito Mr. McComb
was that his wife had made the acquaint
ance of | a woman in Ukiah and suddenly
disappeared with a Mrs. Shiels and; one
of his little children.
Lahne's ranch is about three miles from"
Ukiah, so recently he rented a dwelling in
that town ". to J give his four children the
Benefit of attending school. 7 He, of neces
sity, had to stay on the ranch, and it was
during his absence that his â¢ wife, Fannie,
formed new associations l and | finally. ran
away.*? Last sThursday5 Thursday 1 the woman" took
the youngest child and came to San Fran
cisco with Mrs. â¢ Shiels, who went :to the
house of a Mrs. Flynn at 200 Noe street.
; Mrs. Shiels returned home after a brief
stay in the City. "No information reeard
ing the runaway wife could be obtained on
Noe street. It was not even.: known; there
that such a woman was in existence. Only
one other clew remained for the husband.
Last May Mrs. Lahue was in San > Fran
cisco and at that time' she stayed at the
house of; a family named Fanning on
Howard street, f The number was not re
membered and the name - could not ; be
found in the City/Directory, so all trace
of the missing woman was lost.. â¢
7 Mrs. Lahue is described by her husband
as a woman of 27,: years of age, dark in
complexion, stout and of medium height.
She is the adopted child of M. W. Place of
Ukiah. 7 The ; little â  girl, Bessie, ;is \ but 2

The twenty- second year of the reign of

"Chinese New Year's," as it is more prop
erly called by the white trash, is really the
only red-letter day among the Celestials,
and permits of considerably more latitude
than any other ' festival day extant. 'For
instance a -child born on the 11th becomes
two years old on the 12th, each Chinese
new year permitting 1 the parents to add
one, provided they only utilize the year
that immediately follows birth. If* the
child is born on the 12th -it is called two
years of age on the next New Year's date.
This custom would never be tolerated by
American v girls, but nevertheless it is a
great luxury to the Mongolians.
. The people believe that all varieties of I
devils can be successfully banished at, this
season of J. the i year provided the Tight
course is pursued. 'â -'-. One of the most gen
erally used plans is to shut up the L entire
house and discharge several thousand fire
crackers | inside at the foot â  of : the front
door. Immediately following the fusillade
there is a wild I demand for fresh air, and
in the scuffle the devil is supposed to make
bis escape, through the largest aperture.
After this ceremony iis completed the
gentlemen who have put up the job on
his Satanic majesty calmly lie down and
smoke a few pipes "of opium or load their
weapons for some neighboring highbinder.
Chinese who have tried this method of re
moving devils have never tried any other
since.- 7 ""J7V . '. , . ""7.'-7 7 ._-::
However strange it may seem, there is
an unwritten law among the Chinese to
seal their lips against their enemies during
new year celebrations,: and 'nothing but
good * words â¢' are "' permitted "1' to I flow. > If
a Chinaman meets â¢an i acquaintance who
has _; knife up his sleeve for him he rips
back lips in a -bland smile, passes over
a cigar and : gives him â ': the * merry glad

walk into the house of their sworn enemy,

there was a big convention : . on: hand - and
every man wanted support. ; 7* "* T 7 ?â '
All day long yesterday the several col
ored dignitaries f of the ' settlement were
making calls and exchanging bon mots in
keening with the season. Able-bodied
punks smoked in every doorway, and the
aroma r. of " firecracker | powder . rilled the
atmosphere. The white people who visited
the scenes *of f the festivities gave â <â  them
selves j over to "j the g Chinese guides, and
brushed up â  against 3 the V silk* sleeves of
three-buttoned aristocrats, who had come
out of ; their tinseled houses to flock with
theplebes.

time. -> Burning * tissue â â¢ papers and sacred
fires sent i thict bine smoke curling
into the rich " embroideries, and the heavy
air, dim with 7 straggling {light; floated '
slowly around the false gods before which
the 'faithful? knelt : and Â« oscilated 5 their
bodies, muttering supplicating prayers
and contrite pleadings for forgiveness for
their wickedness. Slowly the ..penitent
â¢entered the matted hallway and with shoe

The streets are : jammed with merry
makers, and children dressed in all the
colors of the rainbow, but with an. out
landish arrangement, toddle along â¢ after
their parents and flop their cues from side
to side in a playful manner. They crowd
their/faces with sweetmeats of 'all kinds

six inches of sugarcane down his throat
and gnaw at it in; the most complacent

â â ' In the afternoon the celebrated, thirty
foot dragon, known by. the name of ,Mo
Lung, was brought out on the shoulders of
three men and paraded around the streets,
it looked like a shelf- worn stage property
for. the "Black Crook" company, but did
great. service in driving away the. devil,
together with most of the dogs in the
neighborhood. Its sides were covered
with tinsel to resemble scales and the gro
tesque head glistened with many colors.
Behind came a host of men with spears
and other paraphernalia of â  war, all ,of
which they flourished in the highest style
of the â  devil-chasing art. Hundreds of
boys followed thjs affair, expecting to see
it turn and devour half the population
any moment. It was carried around Chi
natown at intervals during the day and
also appeared at night, with light effects
darting from the massive - eyes. 7 The
I 'Dante's Inferno" at the Midwinter Fair
never looked worse than Mo Lung did last
night.
About 3:30 in the afternoon the residents
at the corner of Waverly place and Clay
street began to let immense string of fire
crackers out of the second-story windows
into long chutes over the porch, which was
well sprinkled to prevent fire. On the ad
joining roofs and . porches great numbers
of Chinamen gathered, while the streets
became packed with all sorts of charac
ters, who seemed to come from all parts
of the City.
The Chinamen who had*:' the matter in
charge seemed to be waiting for: some
thing, and it was finally announced that
they were not allowed â¢ to J eet boisterous
until 4 o'clock. The hour, was drawing
near and the mob increased every mo
ment, everybody apparently interested in
the arrangements. The blind girl got in
a few more collections and was just about
to get into the chorus of "The Sunshine of
Paradise Alley" when the string of fire
crackers were lowered to the street | and
touched off. In an instant they began to
pop and crackle, and in less time than it
takes to make the statement a steady rat
tle began, and when the fire reached* the
reserve bombs scattered along the line at
intervals it r seemed *' as though a mitrail
leuse gun was j pouring â¢ its fire into your
ear. .-. . ...Â°,. ; . - Â .
The crowd began to \ thicken . and the
police found it necessary to use consider-'
able force %to keep them â  back i from ' the
Clay - street 7 cable -cars, Â'â¢ which â¢â¢; passed
through the'smoke, while the passengers
held their ears and mothers drew their
children toward them. "As "C the , strings
were played i out ' the explosives increased
in size and in fifteen minutes or less giant
crackers appeared strung along with the
little fellows. -.-'â â¢â¢â ?- â ;â :.
7 The bombs became more frequent and
the : crackling increased ' to â  a -"' roar that
deepened 'â ' every moment. Horsemen
turned ;I their % animals bacir I and went
around the block. ' The 1 Chinamen .were
well in for the ? racket by - this '* time and
piled in the " bombshells and firecracker
mines. The bursting 7of thousands of
crackers every ; second was \ bad enough,
but , the additional V noises 4 . added to* the
din. Suddenly one of the Chinamen play
ing out a v string let it slip through bis
hands and fifty feet- of the" red hell dropped
in a heap on the street, exploding with a
long roar, scattering millions of fragments
over the .crowd,' showering 'them'- for five
minutes! .from* the : smoke-laden air.": J Im
pulsively the 5 throng moved back and be-"
gan to scatter. This was kept up for one
hour, and those who took a car and left the

THE FATHER NUGENT CASE
An Effort Made to Show That the
Priest Perpetrated a
Fraud.
MRS. GALLAGHER'S STATEMENT;
On Her Deathbed She Signed a Paper
. Designed to Prevent Inquiry as
to Property Transfers.
â 
: The trial of the suit against Rev. Father
Denis Nugent to recover a large sum of
money which he is alleged to have secured
from Mrs. Ellen ; Gallagher, during . her
lifetime by exercise of undue | influence
upon the woman was continued before
Judge Hunt all day yesterday. No ' very
strong \ evidence : was developed. The
plaintiffs will close their case this morn
ing. ' -' â¢
; Mrs. : Catherine Hurley, who was em
ployed as a domestic in Mrs. Gallagher's
house from 1894 to the time of her death,
in April,' 1895, was the i first witness. She
said she was a constant attendant upon
Mrs Gallagher, not only in the house, but
when she " walked or rode abroad. ' Mrs.
Gallagher had very few callers aside from
Father "Nugent, who was a frequent vis
itor, as was also Sister Mary B. i Russell
mother superior of the Sisters of Mercy at
St. Mary's Hospital. , *'
- In regard to Mrs. Gallagher's last sick
ness the witness said it began on a Thurs
day and terminated in death on the fol
lowing Monday. The witness was by her
side nearly all of that time. A doctor was
sent for immediately upon Mrs. Galla
gher's falling ill. The witness did not
remember any one calling upon Mrs. Gal
lagher during her sickness. Father Nugent
called to ask about her, but did not enter
her room ; neither did any attorney or
notary enter the room so far as witness
was aware.: The outside door of the house
was unfastened, so that any one might
enter and go upstairs j without disturbing'
Mrs. Gallagher. . The witness said * that
Mrs. Gallagher was a deeply religious
woman" and devoted to her church, but
declared that she was by" no means weak
minded. Under cross - examination by
J. H. Campbell the witness , said the de
ceased could not be said to be more devout
than any other religious woman. , â¢'
Li "I suppose she attended mass morning
and evening?" inquired Mr. Campbell.
George R. B. Hayes sitting just' back of
I Mr. CamDbell, leaned forward and whis
pered anxiously:
"Ah!" said Mr. Campbell, "I find I am
wrong. It is mass in the morning and in
the evening vespers, ; I am pleased to be
corrected." ;/ : : ,
1 "It is not impossible, with such progress,
that you' will leave your money to the
Catholic Church," said Barclay Henley
smilingly. .7. -'
" "I might leave it to a less worthy ob
ject,'.', retorted Campbell, "a far leus
worthy object/' .;
- Mrs. jÃosanna; Reilly, a full cousin of
Mrs. Gallagher, was the next witness. She
testified to the deep religious nature of the
deceased; that she spent most of her time
in her devotions.
A deposition was read from Father Nu
gent himself. In it he "said that apart
from being his spiritual adviser he had al
ways been an intimate friend of (Thomas
Gallagher." He had never had anything to
do with - Gallagher's business affairs dur
ing his. lifetime. Afterward, however, he
acted as business agent for Mrs. Gallagher.
He denied that Mrs. Gallagher had exe
cuted the deeds for any of the property un
der fear- of impending deatn, although
they were executed during her last illness.
At the time, however, he said she had no
idea that she was about to die.
The question was asked, "How did she
come to make the deed? What did she
say?"-: â â â â -.;â * â¢ ... Â:...
"She said, 'My. husband was taken
short; I'm not going to be taken short. "
"What did she mean by that?" >. * :
"She said that her ? husband, had in
tended to be his own executor and to have
everything settled up before he died. He
died, -however, too suddenly to accomplish
his purpose."
You : say Mrs. Gallagher did. not think
she was going to die?" ,
"No, she did not. But she wished to be
on the safe side. Life was uncertain."
. "Did | she - speak of the church and the
Archbishop?" ; ... ,
"She said she did not wish the Arch
bishop to have it. It might not go where <
she wanted it to go. She wanted me to
have it and to build a church and a house
with it." Ht â ::"; : .-7. . : I &â <:* ilx w
"What kind of a house?"
"The sort of house I deserved."
In, .his deposition, Father Nugent ad
mitted that be received I altogether j about
$120,000 / from \ Mrs. ; Gallagher, : including
the house." She -gave him large sums for

J. F. BIDDER'S SALARY.
The Debris Commissioner;: Wants His.
" Money and" Sues for It. .
J. F. Kidder, the -Debris Commissioner
appointed by Governor ; Markham m De
cember, 1894, has petitioned the Supreme
Court for a writ of ., mandate compelling
the estate Controller to pay his salary. >f \-
The act under which Kidder's appoint
ment was made possible set forth \ that
|250,000 for the erecttou of dams and other
work should be approp rated by the Legisla
ture, but that none.of it should be used
until a similar amount should be appropri
ated by the Federal Government. The sec
ond $2*50,000 bas not been appropriated, and
so the Controller has taken the position that
as the State appropriation could not be
utilized, the Debris Commissioner could
not earn his salary. The act provides that
the Commissioner- shall receive $300 a
month during the discharge of his duty,'
and it outlines as part of his duty, consul
tation with the United States engineers
who also have : under their charge â¢ the
building of impounding dams, and other
works. Since his appointment the peti
tioner has â  been in; consultation 'at a
number of the gatherings ' of the United

BEATTY'S INSURANCE CASE
The Claim of a Baptist Pastor
as Beneficiary of a
Debtor.
' "
Three Times, the Case . Was Tried and
Finally the Plaintiff Was â <;-
Nonsuited.
Judges Gilbert, Ross and Hawley of the
"United States Circuit Court of Appeals
listened yesterday to the arguments of
Attorneys I. B. L. Brandt and J. C. Bates
in an insurance case which has kept life
insurance circles on the gui vive for some
years. . The arguments were made on the
appeal of Rev. George "W. Beatty, formerly
a Baptist minister of Los Gatos, to recover,
as creditor, $4000 insurance which E. L.
Smith, a stockbroker, took out for Pastor
Beatty's benefit. The company defendant
is the Mutual Reserve Fund Life Associa
tion of New York. -7
Mr. Beatty dealt somewhat in mining
stocks himself, and in the course of busi
ness he became acquainted with the firm
of E. L. Smitn & Co. He also became the
firm's creditor to a large; amount, but
it finally went into bankruptcy. ' When
Smith took out his policy it was his par
ticular object to make. Mr. Beatty the
beneficiary, and in that way* it was hoped
the â¢â â  account between them might be.
squared. I ? â¢"'",;; "7 â¢"-* ' - â¢: > 7/
I Mr. Beatty was in the habit of paying
Smith's premiums, and this he managed to
do somewhat irregularly for about five
years. Five times at least the premi
ums became overdue, and the custom
of the company was, *by an ar
rangement of business accommodations,
to accept the delinquent premiums when
proffered, provided they were accompa
nied by clear certificates of health.
On May 1, 1889, Mr. Beatty tendered $39
three days after it was due to Cashier C.
D. Park of the Bank of San Jose, the spe
cial treasurer of the company there, and
Mr. Park insisted upon a clean certificate
of health 1/eing produced as usual/ He
allowed Mr. Beatty to leave the $39 on de
posit pending the production of the certifi
cate. Mr. Beatty refused to get the certifi
cate, however, and several months later he
drew back the money. In course of time
Smith died. x Then Mr. Beatty thought he
had a claim: against the company; and
after trying to get what he could by com
promise or otherwise and" failing he began
suit. â¢" â -' â â¢-â -â¢â¢â¢.â -â¢. .... .Â» ..,
I The case was tried in the United States
Circuit Court three times. On the first trial
the jury disagreed; on"the second the jury
gave the * plaintiff a* verdict for the full
amount -asked for, but a new trial was
granted, and on the final trial Judge Mc-
Kenna took the case out of the jury's hands
entirely and nonsuited Mr. Beatty.
:: These facts were all brought out yester
day by Mr. Brandt, the attorney for the
Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association
and used to support his contention that
i Beatty had forfeited his policy by his
non-payment of premiums, and had no
claim either in law- or reason
against his client. He argued that
if the court decided in favor of Beatty it
would demoralize : and completely upset
the whole system of insurance; that the
payment* of premiums was the Vital con
dition of the contract between Beatty and
the f company, and : that when Beatty
failed to perform his part of the agree
ment the contract was broken and made
â void in the very nature of things. -
Attorney Bates argued that his client
was entitled to consideration, having paid
a number of premiums; 'but Attorney
Brandt responded by ; saying the obliga- j
tion of the company hinged entirely upon
Beatty's fulfillment of his obligation. "
The case was submitted for decision.

â MRS. TUNNELL TO
BE A WITNESS
It Is Claimed That She Is
to Appear for Mrs.
Cooper.
MRS. BARTON'S OPINION.
Declares That She Knew of Miss
Mattie Overman's Career
Months Ago.
ALL READY FOR THE COUNCIL.
The Various Churches Elect Delegates
for the Forthcoming Inves
tigation.
Mrs. Barton, 16 Dale place, who figured
in the Brown-Davidson scandal in its
earlier stages, claims to know the myste
rious witness of Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, by
whom that lady confidently expects to
prove the charge of immoral conduct now
resting against the pastor of the First Con
gregational Church.
This witness, according to Mrs. Barton,
is none other than Mrs. Tunnel], who dis
appeared the day following the arrest of
Mrs. Davidson.
"Â£ kept out of this case during the ex
citing preliminary hearing," said Mrs.
Barton yesterday, "because I wanted first
to see Mrs. Tunnell. I have followed her
movements t closely and can "at anytime
lay my finger on her, though I have had
no communication with her since the day
. before Christmas. Now, I don't propose
to tell all I know, or how 1 found it out,
but it is true that Mrs. Tunnell is now the
witness of Mrs. Cooper. Why shouldn't
she come out on the side of truth and
justice, even though she did wrong in the
first instance in attempting to shield Dr.
Brown? Â«;7' â '"'-Â£'
"Mrs. Tunnel], not considering Miss
Overman, of course, is the only living per
son who can give all the facts of this in
teresting case. Why shouldn't Mrs.
Cooler then hunt her up and convince her
that public morality compels her to speak? I
1 can tell everything that Mrs. Tunnell. '
would swear to on the witness-stand,
though, of course, "my statement would j
not carry nearly as much weight as that I
of Miss Overman's companion. My state
ment is not strictly hearsay, for what I
know of Dr. Brown's alleged immoral con
duct comes directly from Mrs. Tunnell.
That lady is a dear friend of mme â in
fact, we exchanged confidences.
"One day last year Mrs. Tunnell for
various kindnesses done her made me a
present of a little home up in Gait. She
wanted me to go up and inspect it, but I
didn't have the money, so she offered to
let me have it, promising to bring it next
day. Well, that is .the last I saw of her
for four months. She did not even write
to me, and I had come to think that she {
pad been foully dealt with. This idea was
dispelled, however, when one day there j
came a knock at my door and in walked i
Mrs. Tunnell. . -7
"She told me then of her hurried,
though lengthy, visit to Tacoma, where
she went to nurse Miss Overman through
a serious illness. The nature of this sick
ness has already been fully gone into.
Mrs. Tunnell said.that Dr. Brown had paid
the expenses of Miss Overman and her
self, and had been generous in bis gifts to
her. She had a lot of new clothes, which
she said had been given her by the pastor.
"At that time I thought Dr. Brown was
a single man until all this scandalous af
fair came out. I knew that men were
sometimes guilty of such things, but I
was shocked beyond expression . when I
heard- of his wife. Her name was men
tioned frequently by Mrs. Tunnell, but I
always thought she was his mother.
"There are hundreds of little things
that Mrs. Tunnell told me, all bearing on
the case, but as I expect to be a witness it
is hardly proper to go into detail now.
They will ail come out in due time, if not
through me then through Mrs. Tunnell."
â Mrs. Barton will be called before the
council to tell what she knows of the case,
provided Mrs. Tunnell does not material- '
ize. In this latter event any statement
from her would be entirely worthless. She
will, however, be called on by the defense
in.the Davidson case to recount her rela
tions with Mrs. Tunnell. Mrs. Barton is
the lady whom John Pierce said he heard
declare herself to be Mrs. Baddin.. She
crew quite indignant yesterday when asked
if the story was true.
"The idea is simply absurd," she said.
"I know Mr. Pierce very well, and I can
not believe that he ever made such a state
ment. I never met Miss Overman in my
life and never saw Mrs. Davidson except
in court. -Mrs. Baddin, however, does
exist and is a member of the World's
Christian Co-operative Society."
Several members of the council have
given it out that if Mrs. Davidson's trial is
in progress next Tuesday the bearing of
Dr. Brown's ' case will ' be continued for a
few days. This possible course is not at
the suggestion of Dr. Brown, but eman- I
ates from one of the local churches.
There is said to be a scheme on foot to !
secure bail for Mrs. Davidson with a '.view j
of putting her on ' the lecture '.platform.
Last night thefvarious Congregational
churches of this City and elsewhere met to

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 12.â At the
regular weekly meeting of the First Con

tis .was selected as the member Of the con- â 
clave, which will convene in San Francisco
next Tuesday for the purpose of ;â  examin
ing into the charges against Dr. Brown.
Mr. Curtis is an old resident of Sacramento
and was chosen v for. his cool, clear-headed- ,

THEIR ACTION RATIFIED.
The Power of the Council Commit
tee Confirmed by the Church
Members.
There was more spirituality displayed at
the prayer-meeting of the First Congrega
tional Church last 'night than for several
weeks, and there was an entire absence of
that unexpressed but still recognizable
acrimony that has characterized these
gatherings ever ' since the reports alleging
immoral conduct on the part of the pastor
became public pioperty. The attendance
was much above the average.
7 "Charity" was the theme of the Bible
verses read by Deacon Dexter, who pre
sided at the request of the pastor, made
during the afternoon. It called forth
much feeling comment, even the pastor,
who occupied a -place on the platform,
paying a tribute to the diction and spirit
of the passage.
' When the devotional exercises were
concluded, Dr. Brown asked leave to make
a motion, saying: , 7
The reason I make this motion was because
some think the motion of last Wednesday was
defective and not because the action of the
committee could be called into question. But
the question has been raised by one or two of
those who have been asked to sit in the coun
cil, and because it is possible for us to quiet all
such questions. - â¢<" ~~~ :
I move that this church ratify and sanction
the action of the committee appointed last
Wednesday in sending out letters-missive call
ing a council to investigate certain matters
mentioned therein. . . v V 77*
- He added that he had objected to the
use of the word "charges" in the letters,
but the committee decided to retain it.
He then signed the letters-missive under
protest; but. stated that he would now
waive all his rights and would simply ask
that the committee's action be ratified, as
he had ho intention or desire to see the
matter delayed.
\ A discussion followed on the point
whether it was necessary to sanction the
action of the committee, but when' the
motion was finally put it was carried
without a dissenting voice.
| On Mr. Littlefield asking for a . report of
the action of the committee Deacon
Barnard referred him to the newspapers,
saying: "The reports of the public prints
are substantially correct; entirely so."
i During the thick of the debate C. P.
Wolcott, who has on several occasions
acted the part of the bull in the china
shop, more to the dismay of his friends
than of his enemies, in angry tones of re
proach;' remarked : "I can't understand
how intelligent men could have = been so
misled as to have used the word 'charges.' "
This evidently suggested an idea to the
pastor, for he immediately took the floor
and said: "-I sincerely hope we may vote
On my motion without unnecessary discus
sion. If there. is going to be any differ
ence I should be inclined to raise a more
serious question on the lines mentioned by
Brother Wolcott in reference to the word
'charges.'"
â¢ Dr. Brown, after the adoption of his mo
tion, expressed his gratitude to Rev. W.
W. Case "for his courageous words of last
Sunday night.'' He also thanked certain
j papers, which he declined to name, as it
I might be construed, he said, into a special
j plea, for their present attitude. "During
I all this storm of accusation," he added,
j "they have said nothing against me."
j A question arising as to how the matter
was to be;; brought to the- notice of the.
council, Deacon Barnard moved that M.
P. Woodhams, a young attorney, who was
vouched for as. being strictly non-partisan,
be appointed to present to the council on
behalf of the church all the records bearing
on this matter and to make any state-:
ments explanatory of the situation that he
might deem advisable. The motion was
adopted by a unanimous vote.
The meeting then adjourned after Dr.
i Brown pronounced the benediction.

TWO MYSTERIOUS FIRES.
William Sullivan's Saloon on Ninth
- Street in Flames Twice in ;
One Day.
Fire from some mysterious cause broke
out in a saloon owned by William J. Sul
livan, at 424 Ninth : street, at 9:15 o'clock
last evening, and before .the flames could,
be extinguished the furnishings of the
saloon were entirely destroyed and the
building damaged to some extent. A
peculiar circumstance connected with lhe
fire is that the saloon was closed just prior
to the time the : flames were discovered.
Upon the arrival of the Fire Department
the door was forced open and ; it was dis
covered that the fire had started beneath
the bar in the front portion" of the build
ing. Another fact which points toward
incendiarism is that early yesterday
. morning the building was nearly destroyed
from a fire which started . in one of the
rear rooms. There were a number of cir
cumstances connected with this fire which
looked suspicious, and a deputy Fire Mar
shal was placed in charge of the building
and remained the.c until 4 o'clock in the
afternoon, but was then removed. ' Fire
Marshal Towd is now investigating the
case, and it is very probable that arrests
will follow. ' 'â 'â¢'-' ' 7 â¢ '.
SOUTHERN HEIGHTSALERT
Several Matters to Be Brought
Up at the Next
Meeting.
A Committee to Ask Mr., Vining to
Give Transfers From Sixteenth
to Kentucky Street.
,- ... 1
The .Southern Heights Improvement!
Club will hold a meeting at Raymond's
Hall, on Twentieth (formerly Napa) street,
between Arkansas and Wisconsin, to-mor
row evening. v â¢ â¢
One of . the subjects that will be brought
up is the necessity of having sidewalks
laid on Eighteenth street, from Kentucky
up to Mississippi, a distance of six blocks.
Since the street railroad tracks have been !
laid, on Eighteenth , street that thorough- ;
fare has been paved along the line of ; the |
railroad and, all that is now needed to
make this street; the best thoroughfare in
the Southern Heights district 'is to have
good substantial sidewalks laid. The club
will circulate a petition for signatures and
present the same to the Board of Supervi
sors. . â  '.":. '. - . . .-. ..-7:
--:. Another matter of great importance to
this district is the question of transfers.
Lately the Sixteenth-street branch of the
Market-street Railway. Company has been
put in operation along Solano; street -; to
Kentucky street, but the transfer arrange
ments do not give the residents of this por
tion of the City a satisfactory car service.
Transfers are issued from the eastbound
Solano streetcars at Kentucky street south,
but not northward to the center of the CitjL
From the westbound' cars transfers are is
sued in both directions at Bryant avenue
and Sixteenth street, and at Sixteenth and
Harrison, where the line is broken by the I
steam railroad, transfers are issued to the
continuation along Sixteenth and Church*
streets. The Southern." Heights residents
are by this means .enabled;. to come to the
main portion of i the City for one fare, but
the route is so long and; inconvenient that
it is not . popular. 7 The club will discuss
the advisability of .appointing.a commit
tee to wait on Mr. Vining and request that
he issue transfers from the eastbound .So
lano streetcars to the Kentucky * street
northbound cars. . 7 ! . 4; - â¢
;. That section of the City has ! shown, a
great deal of improvement in anticipation
of the } running of the ; electric .; car's, - and'
some of the landlords report an increased
demand for houses, and say they. are. en
abled to get better rents. There are many
improvements contemplated this year,,
both in the building of houses" and in the
improvement of streets. V"" ; .--\' â¢- ;? " : ;J7 . ; â -:
â¢; An innovation is to be made by Mr.
Vining next Sunday in the matter of street
transit which will give the people of i the
Potrero and Southern Heights a chance to
ride from Sixteenth and -Harrison; streets
direct to 4 Golden Gate Park. What Mr.
Vining proposes to do, he says, is to run
. the * : Fillmore-street car out Oak street on
Sundays to the park instead of continuing
out Fillmore street to Broadway as in the
.past. His explanation is that there is more
travel^ on Sundays to and from the ' park
than north and south. There will be a car
on i Fillmore - street running from Page'
street through to Bay, however, to ? accom- :
modate north and south bound travel. 'â -

ARE LOSING THEIR DUPES.
A Noticeable Thinning Out
Among the Hangers-on in
the Poolrooms.
ARE BADLY DEMORALIZED.
False Odds,, Wrong Jockey and Betting
on Races Already Run, Fast
Becoming a Failure. '
Thepoolrooms were again in a sad state
of demoralization yesterday. Their inac
curate reports; and false odds of the day
previous had a dampening effect on the
motley crowds that gather in these dens
and contribute their beggarly pittance to
the crafty, proprietors who boast of their
pull and refer to their customers as "jays."
â¢ Tired at last of trying to beat a game
made doubly , hard by crooked reports,
misquoted odds and wrong jockeys the
jays are fast thinning out. ; Many former
patrons of the poolrooms . were j seen J bet
ting their money at the racetrack yester
day, and one man remarked that in future
when he wanted to be "stood up" he would
remain out Tate ; nights and give some
sand bagger a chance.. â â¢â â â¢â -..-'..â¢
The rooms made frantic endeavors to get
the results from Ingleside yesterday, but
with no better results than on the preced
ing days. "Fifty-one minutes ; elapsed be
fore they received the result of the i open
ing event. Three wrong jockeys were
posted, and as a sample of how the odds
are "pinched" Pecksniff, a 40 to 1 shot at
the track, was held at 4to 1. . . .
Mistakes in - the race following were of
much more frequent occurrence. Jockeys
were chalked up on two scratched horses,
and on five of the other starters the wrong
riders were given. Myron was not scratched
until one hour and forty minutes after his
entry had been made void at the track and
fifty-one minutes after the race had been
decided. ,
. Huntsman, a4O to 1 shot at the track,
was held at the short price of 10. The
winner, Monitor, was 2 in the rooms and
4J_ at the track. The result of the race
was not known until one hour and twenty
three minutes had elapsed. 7 ?â â¢' "':â 
.It was forty-three minutes after the third
race had been run before the rooms learned
of the winner. Four wrong jockeys were
marked up, and three scratched horses had
jockeys up. The race was run at 3:19, and
the scratches were not received until 3:45.
The winner, Kowalsky, : was â¢ piloted by
Chorn, while : the "commission-houses"
had Hewitt up. .
Ten "ieppers" went to the post in' the
hurdle race and of the riders the rooms
had '"nine wrong. keys were up and
odds quoted against the two horses that
were scratched. Janus and Hal Fisher
were hot marked off as non-starters until
6 minutes after the race had been decided.
_ The scratches on the event and the win
ners of the second and third races were an
nounced at the same time. - One hour, and
thirty-two minutes was consumed in ob
taining the result. The odds quoted were
ridiculously lower 'than those laid at the
track. 'â -,;â¢â ' ?.** --.-, 'â¢'â¢ ";"'7-7 â¢;..-; â¢ â ;;..:-.
. The"commission-houses" were evidently
not aware; that Pittsburg Phil scratched
his mare Derfargilla, for they had her an 8
to 5 choice for the fifth race. At 4:31 the
race was decided and at 5:10 the mare was
scratched; in the various gambling dens.
The odds laid against the actual starters
'were charmingly close, with a decidedly
strong taint of . the pawpbrokerage busi
ness about them. Thelma', a2O to 1 chance
at Ingleside, had but 4 laid against her
chance. A decidedly strong tip must also
hÂ«.ve been f out jon Genette 'Edwards, for
while 200 to 1 was chalked up against her
at Ingleside the odds downtown were 10 to
1. Ferrier, a2oto 1 shot ' at the : track, had
but 2 to 1 before his name on the scalpers'
boards.' The jockeys were also badly
mixed up. . ;.;. .. ;.*â¢%â¢;
The odds on the last race were posted at
Ingleside at 4 -.45. Up to this time the
gambling resorts had learned the results
of but three races. Red Glen, Ed Kearney
and Basso were all held at much closer
prices than were laid at the track. Of the
forty-seven jockeys posted at the track to
ride in the different events the poolrooms
were in error - twenty-four times and had
riders up on nine scratched horses.
. With all of the; criminal' element they
have had recourse to the plans "of the
gamblers appear to have met with defeat.
Their repeated and open violation of the
law can hardly -prevent justice from clos
ing the crime-breeding dens in the near
future. ____________ ;

-THE MEEOEgABY.
Days When Veteran Soldiers Were Worth
Their Weight in Gold. ..
The mercenary fighting man is a person
who seldom receives his due reward during
his lifetime or his just meed of fame after
his death. The character is one so alien to
the age in which we live, It belongs so en
tirely to the days ; when fighting was; the
only occupation of a gentleman,- that it has
forfeited alike our study and our sympathy.
Volunteers we understand, but mercenaries
we do not. The world apparently has
grown to think that fighting as /a profes
sion the bare trade of <f arms, unconse
crated by any sentiment of cause or coun
tryâ not a noble thing, and should not,
however ably and gallantly followed, be
adjudged the highest praise.
"Possibly the world is right; but we sus
pect that change of system in the training
of fighting men has had far more influence
than mere abstract humanity in creating
this opinion. In these days of short ser
vice and swift wars the old type of t>ro
fessional fighting man has become extinct.
In every country the recruit is forced
through a soldier's education at high press
ure, and returned Ito civil life as speedily
as possible, that he may earn money to
pay for the education of others. No man,
unless he be an officer, devotes his whole
lifetime t^o the military calling, and conse
quently the few mercenaries (the name is
too ignoble for them) who are known to
; us in these latter days are without excep
tion officers Gordon, for instance; Valen
tine Baker ana Hobart. It was not so of
old, when the rule was once a soldier al
ways a soldier, and- the only, school was
war. Then few men dreamed of rising to
command except through the ranks, and
many gentlemen preferred to stay all their
lives in , the ranks, or at highest to carry
the engines of their â¢ companies. Veteran
soldiers were worth > their weight in gold,
and though by no - means innocent of
rapacity followed their calling from sheer
devotion to it, and thought themselves
unlucky if they died in their beds.Mac

Naval Tactics.
Admiral S. B. Luce, U. S. N*., states in
an article on "Naval Warfare Under Mod
ern Conditions," printed in the current I
number of the North American Review,
that naval tactics have made little progress
as an art since the days of Lissa. "No one .!
has yet risen to state authoritatively how

DR. WENDTE TO
FATHER YORKE.
The Minister , Indites His
Final Letter to the
.Priest.
A PLEA FOR UNITY.
Drift of Modern Thought Toward
a Great and Co-opera
tive Church.
FATHER YORKE WRITES AGAIN.
He Explains the Position of the Head
of the Church in Temporal
Affairs.
The Rev. Dr. Charles W. Wendte, pastor
of the Unitarian church, Oakland, writing
in reply to a late communication from the
pen of the Rev. Father Yorke, says:
Oakland. Feb. 111, 1890.
To the Editor of The Call : I most respectfully
decline to continue the discussion with Father
Yorke or have anything further to do with so
unscrupulous an antagonist; one who is not
lair minded or courteous in debate, and who
evidently cares nothing about the truth in any"
disputed question, but. is simply concerned, by
fair means or foul, | to win the partisan ap
plause of his followers. I shall therefore ignore
anything he has said or may say hereafter.
But there are.many interesting questions in
volved in the discussion which lias lately been
carried on in your columns by various writers.
One of theseâ the topic of Christian unityâ
venture to treat of to-day, anticipating that
many, both Protestants and Catholics, will
differ with me in my conclusions, but trust
ing that the spirit in which I offer, my contri
bution may be appreciated even if my reason
ing be not always approved by the reader. To
be able, through your courtesy, to place my
opinion* before so large a circle of intelligent
minds is an opportunity too tempting and
profitable to be refused.
I would speak to-day of â¢
THE UNITY OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH.
Has it ever existed? Is it possible, and, if so,
on what basis?
To unite all the followers of Jesus into one
great universal church has been the ideal aim
of the Christian world in all ages. The Roman
Catholic church places this idea at the fore
front of its pretensions, as is indicated by the
very term Catholicâ which means the one.
universal, all-including church.
Throughout the Christian ages the church of
Rome has persistently advocated this claim to
unity and universality, notwithstanding the
facts of history abundantly disprove it. Only
recently a Catholic clergyman in these col
umns, in commenting on the many differences
of opinion and sectarian divisions among
Protestants, complacently called attention to
the unity of sentiment existing in his own re
ligious household. This, he maintained,
proved the latter to be the one, only, all
embracing and all-sufficient church. of Christ
on earth.
But is this Claim of the Catholic church a
true and just one ? Is there now, or v. as there
ever a time when the Roman Catholic doctrine
and administration were accepted by all Chris
tians everywhere, or assented to unqualifiedly
by her own adherents? An examination into
the facts of history shows us that this vaunted
unity of Christendom never actually .existed;
that it was never more than a splendid dream,
a sublime Utopia, which never was realized,
and never will be realized on any of the lines
w hich have been laid down for it.
.. THE FIRST DISCIPLES.
If there was ever a generation of Christians
In which we should expect to find this uni
formity of belief and practice, it was among
the first and immediate disciples of Jesus. Yet
the most casual reading of the New Testament
shows us what differences oi opinion there
were among them concerning the personal
ity of Jesus and the nature of his
mission on earth. Some thought him
an ancient prophet restored to life
a^ain. Others held him to ' be , simply a man
who through his righteousness and holiness
had been exalted by the heavenly Father,
after his death to sit at his right hand and
share in his glory. Others,. again, conceived
him to have been a -pre-existent,. heavenly
being whom God had sent down to earth to
dwell in a fleshly tabernacle and execute his
divine mission and then to return again to the
Father and resume his exalted and heavenly
rank which he haa before the beginning of
the world. "-'..-...
How differently, too, they thought on the
subject of the Christian life. Things which
seemed allowable to some were an offense and
horror to others. Paul's epistles are largely
occupied with attempts to settle these differ
ences. The infant church was divided into
two opposite and hostile partiesâ the party of
Peter, whoso center was in Jerusalem, and
which desired to confine the gospel as much as
possible to the Jews; and thefollowersof Paul,
who proclaimed the glad tidings to the Gentile
world and sought to establish a Christianity
independent of the law of Moses. 1
The contest was waged with great ardor and
often bitterness. Paul writes that his life was
several times in danger from certain "false
brethren"â that is, Judaizing Christians. He
calls them-"deceitful workers.',' /'Satan him
self transformed into an angel ot light, whose
end shall be according to their works." It is
evident that there was no such unity of senti
ment and practice in the early church as is"
usually claimed, for it. It displayed as great
differences of opinion and. practices as exists
among Christiana to-day. . . ,â¢
THE APOSTOLIC CHCRCH. ,
This early apostolic church -consisted* of a
number of independent congregations, with a
elmple and democratic form of government,
copied from that of the synagogue. These
churches were hospitable and helpful to each
other, while disagreeing on many points of
faith ana practice. - They held the apostles in
especial honor, but maintained their congre
fational independence. In the churches
ounded by the Apostle Paul among . the G en
tile Christians there was soon developed a
very active intellectual life, which gave rise to
great differences of opinion. 7 .".:.. .
In Corinth, for instance, there were in the
time of the apostles not only followers of Peter
and Paul, but of A polios and Eephas and
others, who also claimed to build on the word
of Christ. There were in the same congrega
tion members.who denied the resurrection and
the life to come; others who held marriage
and the use of animal food to be sinful acts.
. In the church at Colosse speculations arose
concerning the angelic world, and. the nature
of Christ's glory with the Father. Everywhere
In the church innumerable heretical sects made
their appearance. They were called Gnostics
by the more orthodox believers. We should
term them to-day rationalists or radicals.
These maintained- the most antagonistic doc
trines: some profound and others puerile, just
as it Is among radical thinkers to-day. . â¢ -*â â¢-- "
The next generation of Christians inherited
and continued these divisions and strifes and
gave them a literary expression. The writings
of Philo, of Justin Martyr, of Iranacus, Tertui
lian, onsen and others of the early fathers
contain widely divergent opinions on the sub
ject of Christian doctrines. But with the grad
ual introduction of the gospel of Christ into
the Roman empire there arose the dream of a
great universal Christian church which. was to
convert and possess the earth. This splendid
vision dazzled out of sight for the lime all dis
agreements and - rivalries. For mutual help
and to aid in the spread of the new faith a
closer union of the apostolic churches took
place. Toward the close of the third century
there seems to have been also some agreement
on the points of belief essential to christian
discipleship, of which an echo has come down
to us in the so-called apostles' creed, which as
Professor Harnack and others have amply
shown, is not itself ot apostolic origin . -
We know tne story of the triumph of the
Christian over the pagan faith. The Roman
Emperors made it their state religion. At the
first general church council 'at' Nicea, in the
year 325, the articles of Christian faith were
sharply defined in what is known as theXicene
Creed, and the latter was enforced by the im
perial power as the only and orthodox belief
Here, at length, there seemed to be a realiza
tion of the unity of J Christians. The holy
Roman Catholic, 'churchâ universal, 1 alone
saving, and all-sufficient began" its eventful
career on earth.
. CHURCH , CONTROVERSIES.
But its authority did not remain undisputed.
The very distinctness with, which the Council
of Nicea had defined the true doctrines led to
a great dissension in the church, which con
vulsed the empire for long years, â  and whose
central topic was . the deity of i Christ. The
Arian: ana < A thanasian; controversy ensued.
Arius and his followers affirmed the divinity
of Christ, but denied his equality with God.
The orthodox party' under /Athanasitfs main
tamed that he was God from all eternity and
equal with the Father. - This controversy
waged furiously,- divided the Christian world,
and for a long time was' undecided, j Now ; the
Arlans were victors in church and' state and
anon the Nicean party triumphed.' Christen
dom was divided into two hostile camps.
There .were in reality in that day two rival
churches, each denouncing the other, and both
invoking the arm of the worldly power to .sup
press their opponents. 'â ':â¢
No sooner was this controversy disposed of
by the final triumph of the orthodox party
than new dissensions arose, which lasted for
centuries and convulsed the Christian world.
The relation, between the divine and the
human nature in Jesus was now the chief
topic of controversy. The different parties in
the church combatted each other, -not only
with the weapons of the spirit but with banish
ments, executions and fanatical wars. So vio
lent and brutal did these controversies often
become that whereas, in i the first century of
our era a contemporary was moved to exclaim,
"See how these Christians love one another!"
in the fourth- century another witness could
say with equal truthfulness "There are no wild
beasts so ferocious as Christians who differ
concerning their faith." Yet this was the
period in which l the Roman congregation
gradually rose to supreme control and the
Papacy was developed. .
So it remained more or less throughout' the
Middle Ages. In the eleventh century these
differences were accentuated and led to the
permanent estrangement and division of
Christendom into the Greek and Roman
churches. Each party hurled Its anathemas
at the other in parting, and each declared it
self to be the true and only representative of
Christ on earth. Henceforth there were in
reality two Catholic churches, one at Rome
and the other at Constantinople. The Roman
wing of- the original church was now, as it
seemed, left undisturbed to carry out its doc
trine of church unity. But not for long. , The
war of ideas, the clash of rival parties, went on
as before. At one time the Papacy itself was
divided. There were rival Popes at Rome and
Avignon, each . declaring the other to be
schismatics and emissaries of satau. Mean
while the monastic orders and the scholastic
theologians were engaged in just as violent
controversies with each other as any sects of
our own days.
Not only in the ponderous treatises of the
schoolmen, but by the sword, the faggot, the
rack and edict of excommunication did these
disputants seek to controvert each other.
Countless sects of heretics and reformers now
arose in the church. Such were the Cathari,
the Lollards, Aibigen'ses, Vandois and Wal
denses, the followers of Huss, Wickliffe, Sava
narola and Erasmus.
The intense religious agitation of those ages
culminated at last in the Protestant Reforma
tion under Luther, Zwingll, Calvin and others.
By It the Roman church again lost a large por
tion of her following and forfeited the spirit
ual control oi the most powerful, enlightened
and dominant nations of the modern world.
BECENT DISSENSIONS, ...
With the withdrawal oi so large and earnest
an element the church of Rome might
have hoped to enjoy a season of repose in
which to cultivate the sentiment of unity
and obedience among her adherents. But
again divisions arose within her borders.
The example of the Protestants and the in
fluence of modern civilization through its
science, literature, laws, government and so
ciety; have for the past 300 years been steadily
at work disintegrating and sapping her power
over the remaining Catholic nations of the
world. We behold to-day the chief supporters
of her temporal and spiritual sway disaffected,
restless and alienated. Italy, France and Eel- â¢
gium are great battlefields on which the Papal
power wages a continual conflict with its own
spiritual subjects, and constantly loses ground.
The temporal power is lost forever. The con
trol of the schools is gone also. The step now
imminent in France is the abrogation of the
concordat, or compact with Rome,' and the
consequent withdrawal of state support from
the clergy. Austria, Spain, Brazil, Mexico and
the South American republics are following
in the same direction.
Day by day the control of Rome over the
minds and hearts of these nations is lessening.
The pebple of all ranks and classes are becom
ing skeptical of her divine right, indifferent to
her appeals, contemptuous of her authority.
Nowhere in the modern world is unbelief so
widespread and profound as among Catholic
nations. The way is preparing for a great
transformation of the Roman church and doc
trine, or else another separation' from it of
many of her most intelligent members. Even
among the priesthood this is apparent. Ever
since the Reformation of Luther the Catholic
clergy has been divided into two g-eat parties,
the liberal Catholics and. the Ultramontane..
The former has thought to reform and remodel
the church according to the altered needs of
modern society. It has opposed the adoption
of extreme doctrines and measures, and en
deavored to curb the undue power of the
Papacy. The Ultramontane party, on the
other hand, has, under Jesuit leadership,
strenuously denied that the church needed re
forming or improving. It has opposed all at
tempts to reconcile the old doctrines with the
new times, and has especially magnified the
prestige and power of the Papacy.
These two parties have striven with each
other for the mastery, with varying success.
Thus, under Pope Clement XIV," in 1773, the
Liberals secured the abrogation of the Order
of Jesuits. "So long as the Order of Jesus
exists," declared the Papal bull, "it is quite
impossible that the church shall ever arrive at â 
a true and lasting peace." In 1814 the Ultra
montanes again rose to power and Pius VII,
"at the unanimous request of the Christian
world," restored the Jesuits: The ambitious
designs of the Society of Jesus led, in 1870, to
the promulgation of the dogma of Papal in-,
fallibility by the Vatican Council. The oppo
sition to this dogma on the: part of many
liberal and prominent members of the priest
hood was pronounced and bitter.
This opposition, as it was uttered in private
circles, from the pulpit and in the session , of
the solemn conclave itself, has lately been
published to the world. It there appears that
the liberal 1 Bishops denounced the dogma of
Papal infallibility as irrational and impious.
The Pope they ridiculed as a narrow-minded
old man, completely controlled by the Jesuits.
The Ultramontanes returned this opposition
with equal scorn, denouncing the Liberals as
rebels and traitors. .The promulgation of the
dogma, however, compelled the obedient assent
or. separation- of those who had opposed it.
Under the whip and spur of the church power
the most humiliating retractions were made
by most of the dissenting Bishops. But others
like the eminent Doellinger, the most learned
of Catholic church historians, refused to, up
hold what they had denounced as unhistorical
and untrue. .
Doellinger's famous book against Papal usur
pations, entitled "The Pope and the Council,"
by Janus, created an immense sensation in
Catholic circles. As it had appeared anony
mously the Ultramontaine party pretended
that it was not the production of the eminent
' scholar. 'All doubts as to its authorship were
set at rest, however, when , a new edition . ap
peared which bore the name of Doellinger as
its sole author, and in its preface gave an. ac
count of the circumstances under which it had
been prepared. This later edition -is entitled
"Das Papstthum"â "The Papacy" and is fur
nished with full citations and references to
substantiate the assertions and arguments of
Janus.
. Under the leadership of Doellinger, Huber,
Reinkers and other ecclesiastics another sep
aration from Rome took place, known as the
old Catholic movement, which, although not
large in numbers, is of importance as showing
the drift of things in Catholic circles. . -
- AMERICAN CATHOLICS. .'..
Here In' America' there does, indeed, exist
greater uniformity of belief among. Roman
Catholics and dissent is comparatively rare.
The reason for this is obvious. . f The great bulk
of Roman Catholics among us belong to the
less educated class of foreign immigrants who
are accustomed to pbedience, and who do not
think for themselves on religious matters.
With increased education and the gradual in
fluence of our republican institutions in pro
moting . personal independence we must be
lieve that American Catholics will yet prove as
difficult to keep in their, old ways as their
French, Italian or German brethren. The in
cidents or Drs. MoGlynn and Dncey and other
similar rebellions on the part of clergy versus
laity are illustrations in point. There are
twenty, or more Catholics in mv congrega
tions. â¢ This very week I have received a letter
of cordial indorsement of my recent utterances
written in the name of five : Irish-Americans
Catholics by their training. v Â«.
â¢ This review, of: Christian history. shows us
that the claim of the Roman or any other sect
to be the exclusive and universal church of
Christ is unfounded, in fact or reason. There
has always been the greatest diversity of
opinion and practice among Christians, and
this diversity increases rather than -lessens
with the growth of human culture. It was
therefore a very proper saying of the I learned
Catholic scholar .(Eneas Sylvlno, afterwards a
Pope, who tells us; "The Catholic church is
called 'the I universal' church not because all'
men have . ft.'i but because all â  men ought to
have itâa very wise distinction. ;--.â : â¢"
, Let me not be misunderstood as not appreci
ating the many excellencies and virtues of the
Roman Catholic church and clergy. There is
much to profoundly admire in the piety of her
followers and the consecration of her ministers.
I am simply reading her history by the light of
modern researches, which utterly disprove the
claim of her exceptional and , divine right and
place her on ' a par with .the other sects and
churches of Christendom.; 7- ;,;":. -.
, * ,*: PROTESTANT, UNITY. *â
.-. Has Protestantism ever 'attained the ideal of
Christian unity? 1 Most assuredly not. ? The de
velopment of Protestant Christianity has been
attended with intensified ?. differences. Pro
testant history is sadly disfigured with divisions
and strifes, hatred and persecutions. Luther
declared that his I fellow reformer, Carls tad t
was "riding to hell," )â  and >he : rejoiced at â¢ the

mas of episcopacy,, but himself a fugitive,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1896."
clamored for the expulsion of the Roman Cath
olics from England. 7 ...... .;
â ''â  Since their day the increase of true religion
and the growth of enlightened opinion and a
secular state have greatly modified if not alto
gether abolished such intolerant displays. The
Protestant world is, however, still divided into
innumerable sects and parties, all more or less
in conflict with each other and often carrying
the principle of individualism to an absurd ex
treme. But there is this fundamental distinc
tion between the Catholic and the Protestant
idea of Christian unityâ the former seeks to ob
tain it by establishing .here '. on earth a great
external, visible church, whose creed and
ritual shall be the same for all and be accepted
by all. ; The Protestant principle, on the other
hand, seeks to found the invisible and spiritual
church of Christ on earthâ a church which
shall preserve unity of spitit amidst great dif
ferences and operations. â¢ . '7
From the Protestant point of view', therefore,"
the existing division into denominations, . the
great variety of rights and forms, symbols and
ceremonies' and modes of church government
are not only allowable, but a leal help to the
intellectual and religious life, so long as they
do not violate the essential spirit oi Chris
tianity, the spirit of trutlvlove and charity.
As James Freeman; Clarke well said: "The
strength of Protestantism lies in Its sects; its
weakness in its sectarianism." And in a
similar vein Dr. dimming tells us: "The
dissensions of Protestantism go far to consti
tute its strength. By them the spirit of liberty,
the only spirit Rome cannot conquer, is kept
alive." It is because the Protestant churches
have so often violated the great central prin
ciple of true Christianity that they have failed
to realize their idea of unity among Chris
tians. They have sought to identify their
especial creed, or form, or fellowship with the
church universal, instead of ignoring d3nomi
â¢national differences and seeking for a religion
of the spirit and a fellowship based on charac
ter, piety and faith.
A few years since I attended a church con
gress in one of our Eastern cities whose special
purpose was to discuss the true way of arriv
ing at religious and church unity. It was an
admirable . and representative gathering.
There were present leading Baptists, Method
ists, Presbyterians', Congregationalism, Swed
enborgians, Episcopalians, Unitarians and
others. * Each in turn gave his solution of the
question. The Presbyterian thought the
Westminster confession offered the true basis
of union; the New Churchman found it in
the revelations of Swedenborg; the Episco
palian thought his prayer-book the broadest
iouudatipn that could be offered. Thus each,
although in the most beautiful spirit, identi
fied his particular church or creed with the
church universal. As 1 came aw%y it was
with the feeling that these excellent men were
as yet far from that simple bond of union
which Jesus declared over and over again to
be, all-sufficient and. all-essential: "By this
shall all men know that ye are my disciples,
that ye love one another." "He who doeth
the will of oqy Father in heaven is my sister, I
my brother, my, father and my mother. Or, I
again, as he prays in the Gospel of John,
"That they all may be one as thou, Father, art
in me and 1 in thee, that they also may be one
in us." Love, righteousness and faithâ the
beautiful fruits of the spiritâ this is the true,
the only way to Christian unity. â¢ f:i< k',
777 7 CREEDS INADEQUATE.
This review of church history has been un
dertaken to little purpose if it has not shown
that unity is not possible by the j way of intel
lectual agreement. "Dogmas may chain to
gether Christians; they cannot unite them."
The growth of the human mind, the progress
of truth forbid it. Human minds are as differ
ent as human faces. The statement of truth
which attracts one repels another. John Ward,
preacher, can hnd a solemn joy In the thought
of a sinner brought to judgment, a thought
which to Helen, his wife, is exquisite anguish.
The view that satisfied the intellect of a former
generation no longer contents the thinking
mind of to-day. The statement thai expressed
the knowledge or trust of a previous age fails
to utter the larger information or meet the
altered needs of the present time. Restless
ness, doubt, disaffection, unbelief, dissension
and strife are the consequences of all such
attempts to cramp and fetter the mind of man
with dogmas and creeds.
â¢ Furthermore, the great topics of religious
faith are in themselves too vast, too exalted to i
be compressed into a single statement or series
of statements. ' It is easy to say "1 believe in
God," but who shall dare to analyze and define J
his majesty and power and goodness? "Such I
. wisdom is too great for me," declares the an- j
cient seer. "It is too.high, I cannot attain to it."
What presumption on the part of fallen man
to peer into the mystery of the divine exist- i
ence, to express the attributes of Deity in a j
phrase,, aud declare that he must needs desire '
this or do that. ' Heâ the life and source, the |
beginning and end of allâ not only greater
than our heart, he is infinitely greater than
our thought- j He is above our comprehension,
and to set up a binding dogma concerning him
is worse than follyâ is impiety. And so it is
with every one of the dogmas by which theolo
gians have thought to solve in their way the
mysteries of life and death, of good and evil,
of love and law, of time and eternity. As tem
porary statements of our conceptions lof truth
they have their value and use, but the sub
jects they deal with are too far above our com
prehension to authorize us to claim any infal
libility for our opinions or to lay them down
as a basis of Christian union.
LIKE FORMS INSUFFICIENT. \
Christian unity is not possible on the basis of
dogmas. I said. Neither Is it on the ground of
a similar church administration and like forms !
of worship. The temperaments, tasks and
antecedents of men are too various to permit
of such uniformity. The inhabitants of the
tropical soith demand a different form of j
worship from the men of the somber north.
Soma races of men, like the Greeks, Italians,
Spaniards and French possess a native and in
born love of color, display and sensuous im
pression, and desire it in their worship. They
would not be content or feel inspired with the
simple, bare, introspective worship which sat
isfies most Protestants. The Roman Catholic
demands many Â- ceremonies â¢ and forms; the |
Quaker disdains them all. Are they not both !
children of God, disciples of Christ, fellow-
Christians? And shall we deny them the title '
unless they will all alike adopt some one par
ticular form of worship?
To the Episcopalian his beautiful order of
prayer is the central attraction of the Sunday
serviceâ a complete church in itself. To others
it may be formal and uninspiringâ a weariness
to the flesh. Let each be fully persuaded in his
own mind. The Catholic Christian finds his
favorite symbol in the crucifix. To the Puri
tan's religious consciousness the cross was an
object of holy horror. He destroyed , it in the
English cathedrals, and even cut the Cross of
St. George out of the British", flag, and kept it
out for many years. .To mark his contempt for
the symbolism of the papist altar-service, the
Puritan dragged the communion tableâ after
the Lord's Supper had been partaken from it
down- into the body of the church and con
verted it into a seat for the lowliest of the audi
ence. Some of the noblest and most devout
spirits that have ever lived have cared the least
for religious * observances ' and customs. St.
Paul, Calvin and Luther thought the Sabbath
of little, account. Paul warns the Galatians
that they are in danger of sinking back into
paganism by esteeming one day holler than an
other. Luther and Calvin even proposed to
change the Sabbath to Monday or Friday to
mark their unbelief in it as a divine .institu
tion. ,â¢--, â  . â¢ - â 
â¢It may matter to us, but does it matter to the
Infinite One whether we pray with set form of
words, or on our knees, or standing, or looking
into our hat, or y telling our beads, or making
the sign of the cross? The only question with
him is, whether 1 the heart prays, whether our
thoughts .ire with him, thrilling with the sense
of his majesty and mercy, and attentive to his
holy will and service. . ' â¢
' 7 SPIRITUAL UNION.
â¢ I Now, if all this be true, we shall understand
why the Christian world has heretofore failed
in its attempts to attain to a union of all fol
lowers of Christ.' Not by way of dogma, or rite,
or church administration, is this union to be
obtainedâ but ''by one spiritare we all baptized
to one body."
The Christian virtues, the love of truth and

purity,' the love of man, trust in God, the prac
tice of righteousness and the simple piety 01
the heartâ these are tne only tests; the only
possible terms of fellowship. Do you ; tell -me
there is nothing specially Christian about
these? I answer, it ism these things that the
very essence ; of Christianity consists. It Is
these moral and devout elements in the re
ligion of Jesus which have made it the power
it is in the world in spite of the distortions It
has received at the hands of doctrinaires and
ecclesiastics. r If , ever there is to be a union of
Christians all the world over it must be on the
basis of Christ's life and not mere opinions
about him. Religious character - displayed ,in
likeness to Christâ this :is 'the only way of
union, and, if you teil me that this is a plat
form broad enough to. hold the Buddhist, the
Jew, the Mahometan and the agnostic I reply,
"God be thanked all the more."
Christianity was intended to be a world reli
gion and it never can become such while it sets
up petty barriers ; to : shut out the world' and
forgets that while there may be diversity of
gilts and operationsâ of thought and
worshipâ there is one and the self-same spirit
In all. â  All alike, . pagan and . Christian, Jew
and- Gentile, Catholic and' Protestant, ortho
dox and liberal, are God's children, the recipi
ents of his bounty, the objects of , his love and
joint heirs with Christ in the promises of eter
nity. â¢.-. 7 ; :.-- â¢â â¢ â --- ,-,-..:.,: .-â ,-. -.'â .)'
<t Tt was in; this spirit that the Unitarian Na
tional Conference at Saratoga adopted the fol
lowing and offered it to the Christian world as
an , all-sufficient basis of Christian . union:
'Tpese churches. accept the religion of Jesus,
holding, in accordance with his teaching, that
practical religion is summed up in love to God
and love to man. .
"And we invite- to our working fellowship
any Who, white differing from us in belief, are
in general. sympathy with our spirit and our
practical aims."
May other t Christian bodies adopt similar
platforms until we all come into "the unity of
the spirit and the bonds of peace."

FATHER YORKE'S LETTER.
The Chancellor Writes In Regard to
the Temporal Fower-of7-7'^:'.;.{
, the Pope.
In answer to a recent communication
from the Rev. Dr. Wendte of Oakland the
Rev. Father Yorke writes as follows:
r To the Editor of Hie San Francisco Callâ Dear
sir: In my review of the controversy on the
â c nd ,' subject proposed by Dr. Wendte I
divided the matter into relevant and irrele-
I vant. The relevant' matter dealt with the re
lations of church and state; the irrelevant was
made up of a mass of subjects piled higgledy
piggledy into a controversial rubbish heap.
lhe arguments on the relations between
I church and state fell naturally under two
heads :
A. Catholic teaching as set forth by Dr.
wendte; or, What Catholics Do Not Believe.
B. Catholic teaching as set forth by Catho
lics; or, What Catholics Do Believe.
In my.'last letter I reviewed the arguments
brought forward under subdivision A. I will
now review the arguments brought forward
under subdivision â¢ ...
B. WHAT CATHOLICS DO BELIEVE.
The Catholic teaching about church and
state is a development of. the words of our
Lord, "Render unto Caesar the things that are
Caesar's, and unto God. the things that are
God's." To show the truth of this assertion I
quoted from various authorities.
(a) LEO XIII.
From Pope Leo XIII I copied a clear and
unequivocal passage declaring:
(1) That God had portioned the care of the
human race Detween two powers the church
and the state. .
. (2) That each power|bad.a different sphere of
action and that each was supreme within its
own sphere.
(3) That the salvation of souls and|the wor
ship of God belonged to the church.
(4) That the civil and political order be
longed to the state.
In reply to this declaration Dr. Wendte said
j that I had only cited the present Pope to show
i that there was no power but from God.
He added that there was nothing in the pass
age to which a Protestant could object, but he
interjected: "We deny the further dictum of
i the Roman Catholic "church that all human
â  governments must submit themselves to the
Pope's will."
In reply, I asked him where he found that re
' markable dictum that all human governments
must submit themselves to the will of the !
' Pope?
Dr. Wendte made answer: "Father Yorke j
tried in vain to gain entrance into the Sutro
Library."
(b) St'AREZ.
I then quoted the great Jesuist publicist
Suarez to show that the Pope claimed no direct
temporal power over the world. â¢
Dr. Wendte replied that Suarez simply stated
a fact and laid down no law. , -. -â  â  â 
I asked Dr. Wendte if it was necessary to use
up a.ll the auxiliary verbs in the language; to
j express an idea which was intelligible only as
a law.
Dr. Wendte answered that Suarez believed in
killing oil' heretic kings. ,-....
The which belongs to the rubbish heap.
(c) MANITOBA. ,7
j In explaining Catholic - teaching, I had
j described the indirect temporal power as that
I influence which is claimed by every Protestant
I preacher in America, when he tries to sway
| public opinion on temporal things.
Dr. Wendte replied t..at the mischief lay in
this, and he said that an ambitious and
worldly minded clergy were arresting the de
velopment of free institutions, as for instance
in Manitoba. ,
â¢I asked him if on this continent the ambi
tious and worldly minded clergymen were con
fined to the Roman Catholic communion. I
; reminded him that his own city of Oakland
: was plagued with a swarm of political parsons
before whom the 'three historic scourges of
war, famine and pestilence sink Into. Insignifi
cance. I informed him that the Catholics of
Manitoba were fighting for the rights guaran
teed them by solemn treaty, and that the
preacher-ridden majority was steeped to the
lips in forgery, fanaticism and fraud.
t Dr. Wendte only sighed, "With this I con
clude my long but not ineffective reply."
(d) CARDINAL' TARQUINI.
From Tarquini's "Institutions of Ecclesiasti
cal Law" I quoted the principle that civil so
ciety is in temporal things plainly independent
of the church. . 4 - â  . .
Dr. Wendte retorted that there was a snake
hidden in the definition of temporal things,
and he proved the existence of the reptile by
producing a notice denouncing the taxation
of churches which he found in the old Mission
of Monterey. â  â 
I quoted a Methodist Bishop's denunciation
of said taxation and suggested that Dr.
Wendte should include the brethren in his
patriotic strictures. â¢ . ' -
Dr. Wendte responded that I displayed a
deep-rooted aversion toward members of . non-
Catholic communions.
â  (6) TEMPORAL POWER.
Suarez had stated that- the Pope claimed
temporal power over a small territory round
Rome. ' " â¢
Dr. Wendte evidences this claim as a
flagrant proof that the church Would antag
onize the American Government if she could.
â¢ Relegated to the rubbish heap. . : 7 ...
. (/) BISHOP DOYLE. v -.7 '-i;,
_ I quoted Bishop Doyle's evidence before the
British House of Commons in which the
obedience due by Catholics to the civil gov
ernment is defined. ' â¢
Dr. Wendte asked in wonder, "Who is Bishop
Doyle?" . â ...-.'â â¢ ..â¢"â /;'.â¢â -;.â .â¢.',-â¢' ""':. 1
â The question was such a "Mercator's projec
tion" of Dr. Wendte's ignorance that I left it
unanswered and as a testimony. ' .
.Hut, he persisted, -this only, proves that
churchmen can lie when it suits them. ; *
If so why does Dr. Wendte enter on a con
troversy with a churchman? If -we are ready
to lie on occasion why does ' he pretend to be
lieve my word? Surely Dr. Wendte's ignor
ance and' presumption have: led him 'lnto a
tight place where he can escape only by saying
that a great and holy 1 Bishap perjured himself
before the English Senate. Such an answer,
Dr. Wendte, might come from the preacher
lings of "the. A. P. A., but : I expected better
things from a man ; who has aspirations to be
considered a gentleman. That answer stamps j
you," sir, as devoid of the first elements of good*
breeding and it exhibits you before the public
as being. as ignorant of the canons of culture
as you are of the canons of the church. ,
: (g) BISHOP GILMOUR.
Dr. Wendte proclaimed that he preferred
Bishop Gilmour to Bishop Doyle; though why
he should prefer one liar to another I do not
understand. :
â¢ However, let us give him the benefit of his
likes and dislikes. Instead of quoting the odds
and ends of a pastoral which was written
about entirely- different subjects let us see
what the Bishop has to say about the question
of allegiance. 'In a lecture delivered in. Cleve
land on Sunday, April 4,1880, Bishop Gilmour
explained the Catholic teaching in the follow
ing manner: -
7 "We owe spiritual allegiance to the head of
the church as being the representative of God
upon earth. We owe spiritual allegiance to
him because he is the mouthpiece of God to
the world. We . believe that 'as a . part of our
doctrine, but we owe no temporal allegiance
to any person, no matter in what country we
are nor under what fo.*m of government we
are, except to him who is our legitimate ruler
in the country in which we live and move and
of which we are a part. ~ In this country. we
know no temporal ruler except him who is
placed by the free votes and suffrage of a free
people to rule and to govern. . 7 "
"We know no temporal ruler that can come
in and tell us that there is a power to direct
us in our temporal affairs beyond that which
is created by just law and the constitution of
the United States. Whether foreign, whether
native, whether we have taken an . oath of al
legiance or whether we have grown up and in
herited our citizenship," as citizens of this
country we j know no temporal prince or ruler
beyond him who has been elected for the im
mediate government of the people.
"Therefore .- that fear aud that constant
charge that we have a divided allegiance is
founded - upon a mere misconception of our
doctrines. We owe spiritual allegiance to the
Pope; but >we owe temporal allegiance to no
man or country but the country of which we
are citizens."
(h) INFALLIBILITY.
One of the misconceptions to which Bishop
Gilmour alludes has taken full possession of
Dr. Wendte. He declares that an infallible
church can make no mistakes and has therefore
no need to alter its opinion.
The Lord knows there is little excuse for Dr.
Wendte's ignorance of the nature of the
church's claim to infallibility. I have -ex
plained it at least half a dozen times within
the past three months, but even a cathode ray
could not penetrate the skull of those who
are determined not to see. The infallibility of
the church is a divine assistance which" pre
serves her from error in declaring that such or
such. a doctrine has been revealed by Jesus
Christ.' lt has nothing whatever' to do with
her pronouncements on human philosophy or
political science. She is not guaranteed from
error in her acts or in her law. She is guaran
teed from error solely when testifying to a
truth of revelation. 7
.Says Fessler: "The Pope is not infallible as a
man or a theologian, or a priest, or a bishop,
or a temporal prince, or a judge or a legislator,
or in his political views, or even in his govern
ment of' the church." >
The Swiss Bishops wrote in a pastoral which
has received the Pope's approbation:
"It in no way depends upon the eaprlce of
the Pope, or upon his good pleasure, to make
such and such a doctrine the object of a dog
matic definition. He is tied up and limited to
the divine revelation and to the truths which
that revelation contains. He is tied up and
limited by the creeds already in existence and
by the preceding definitions of the church. He
is tied up and limited oy the divine law and by
the constitution of the church. Lastly, be is
tied up and limited by that doctrine, divinely
revealed, which affirms that alongside reli
gious society there is civil society ; that along
side the ecclesiastical hierarchy there is the
power of temporal magistrates, invested in
their own domain with a full sovereignty, and
to whom we owe obedience in conscience, and
respect in all things morally permitted and
belonging'to the domain of civil society."
1 am gradually coming to the conclusion
that a severe course of study in the penny cate
chism would be of wondrous benefit in fur
bishing Oakland scholarship.
Such are Dr. Wendte's objections to my ex
position of the Catholic teaching on church
and state. I have taken the trouble to go over
them one by one, to arrange them and classify
them in order not to leave him the poor excuse
that I have been afraid to meet any of them.
If I have overlooked any it is a pure oversight,
due not to a consciousness that his arguments
are not unanswerable, but due simply to the
fact that in the most careful examination
something is bound to escape notice.
- 1 The gentle reader will | readily . observe - that
Dr. Wendte has not produced a relevant
authentic quotation, a relevant. argument or a
relevant fact to enfect my exposition. .We
Catholics stand on precisely the same ground as
the American constitution. â¢ .When , we swear
allegiance to it our oath is as broad and as
deep and as high as the oath of any other man.
Cardinal Manning's assertion is â¢ incontro
vertible: â .-''
"The civil allegiance of Catholics is as undi
vided as that of all Christians and of all men
who recognize a divine or natural moral law."
7. 11. the rubbish HEAP. .'â¢ ;
I During the progress of the controversy the
Rev. Dr. Wendte developed an uncontrollable
tendency to go off at : , tangents without the
slightest notice. I have relegated all his lit
erary, historical, theological and scientific
aberrations to a place apart, and now I will
consider them in as orderly a fashion as I can.
t\ I think the many extraneous | subjects I may i
be roughly grouped under seven heads: ' .
1. The temporal power. : 77. 7
2. Religious liberty. - ' ,:777
3. Freedom of speech and of the press.
4. The Jesuits. '. '
5. â¢ Catholics and republican institutions.
0. Catholic learning and Protestant converts.
7. Personalities and things in general. -â¢.,.
Some of these sections will admit of further
subdivisions/but I will explain each in its
proper place. . 7
, 1. THE TEMPORAL POWER OP THE POPE.
By, the temporal power of the Pope is meant
not a claim to rule over all states and peoples,
but a claim to civil -jurisdiction' over the city
of Rome and a small territory surrounding it.
This civil jurisdiction belonged to the Pope for
centuries, and was guaranteed by the common
consent of. Christendom. It was lost. when,
after the downfall of France, the Italian Gov
ernment entered the eternal city and made it
the capital of the kingdom.
Against this invasion the Pope still protests,
and demands that his civil independence be re
stored. Dr. Wendte looks upon this as a pre
posterous claim, and, as one which proves that
we would antagonize American institutions if
it suited us. -' . '"'>
In the first place we may remark that the
claim of the Pope has nothing whatever to do
with any part of the world except Rome. In
the second place, let Dr. Wendte remember
that the claim of the Pope could have nothing â¢
to do with any other part of the world except
Rome, because he is Bishop of Rome and the
primacy is connected with that see. '
In the -third place the claim of the Pope is
neither preposterous nor un-American. Â« If the
Catholic nations consider . that the spiritual
ruler of the church should not be the subject
of any of them, why should they not set apart
a district in which he might rule ,
- The United States has set apart a district for
the Federal Government â in â¢ order that â  the
Government might be independent of all the
States. It. has deprived the inhabitants of that
district of the right of self-government for the
sake of the Union. What is there un-American
in the idea that â¢ Christian Europe Should es
tablish an. Ecclesiastical District of Columbia
in Rome? r ' " â¢
What is there un-American in the ' idea that
we Catholics should like to see the Pope made
independent of all national or racealties? He
is the father of the . Catholic church, and he
belongs equally to all his children, just as the
Federal . Government is over all the States and
belongs equally to all. " â 
- Dr. Wendte does Mot seem to realize that the
establishment of the temporal .power depends
entirely on the agreement of the Catholic na
tions, just as the establishment of the Federal
district "depends entirely on the agreement of
the States. Maryland might be willing enough
to give the few square miles. required, but the
giving would not â¢ make the district a Federal
district v. unless all | the I States . took it I under
their protection. < So in the same way Italy is
willing, enough to grant the" Pope a federal
district, but the Pope wants an international
guarantee. He has no ': temporal force, and
cannot have any temporal force to protect 'his
states from an f enemy, therefore he requires
that, these states be made truly international,
or as we should say federal. " : The Pope's claim
is from lop to bottom just and American. -
H Moreover, the claim is not preposterous. , If
Maryland objected to giving up the territory
necessary for the formation of the Federal' dis-
would any one say that the claim of the
United States to that particular piece of land
is preposterous? If the people of Washington
objected to the Government depriving them of
their rights as citizens the objection would be
answered by the plea of , the general good.' So;
if Italy objects or the people of Rome object,
a valid plea against them is the general good'
But some one may remark the cases- are not
parallel. The District of Â» Columbia is what
it " is,", simply because -^ the . â¢ Federal *>â  Govern
ment is located there and, the inhabitants are
willing to put up with certain restrictions on I
their rights because of the benefits they reap
It is added that'll ; the Government should re
move from , Washington it would rapidly sink
back to its pristine condition- of a worthless
morass. J ; -< '; ". â¢â -;,:
--: j It is precisely the same with Rome.' The Pope
makes Rome. "\ If he should leave it to-morrow
twenty i years would see it the decayed capital
of a fourth-rate kingdom. It has no commerce I
no manufactures, no- natural advantages' I
Washington j would ; not decay more rapidly |
"â¢ ".'-7 -" 7 '"-''":-
than Rome if the supreme pontiff took up his
, residence elsewhere. . - .
> The people of â  Italy and the people ;of Rome
know. this. i: The vast majority are in favor of
the restoration of the temporal power. Were
Italian political institutions like oursâ truly
popularâ one election would settle the Roman
question forever. That settlement must come.
The claim of the Pope will yet be granted.' The
stars in their courses fight for the successor Of
â¢ â¢' he fisherman. V Again and again. the cry' of
triumph has gone up that the Papacy is no
more, but again and again has gone up that
cry of despair which was wrung from the
apostate's lips on the desert sands, "0 Gali
lean, thou hast conquered!"
2. RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. _
Dr. Wendte wishes to throw on me the blame
for dragging into this discussion the question
of religious persecution. "â¢ I beg now to state
that this subject was introduced by Dr. Wendte
in his letter on church and state/which was
published on January 17. For the first time
in the controversy we were treated to the sight
of the i "gutters â¢of Smithtield running with
blood." i I was compelled in answer to notice
the subject, but Dr. Wendte need not try now
to put on me the onus of its introduction.
;- As the most of Dr. Wendte's tangential per
formances occurred at or about this point I
subdivide the matter under seven titles:
(a) Aquenas on heretics. ' ' : â¢ ,i
(Â£>) Bellarmine on heretics.
(c) Urban II on the excommunicate. . _ "
(rf) The Jesuits on regicide.
. (c) Catholic and Protestant persecution com
pared. â¢ â¢â  â¢
if) Maryland. '
&). Ecuador.
In the beginning, let me say that I have not
the faintest idea of denying that Catholic
nations persecuted for conscience sake, but
what I do deny is that such ' persecution is or
has been a tenet of the Catholic religion. I
held that in matters of liberality we had
nothing to fear from a comparison with any
denomination.
(a) THOMAS AQUINAS. .
To prove that the Catholic church was intol
erant Dr. Wendte asserted: "Aquinas said
that all heretics ought to be put to death."
Of course Aquinas never said any such thing.
Then Dr. Wendte produces a quotation in
which Aquinas says that the cnurch might de
liver him over to the secular authorities to be
put to death.
I showed that St. Thomas' teaching was that
the church's punishment for heresy was ex
communication. â¢
I showed that not until the thirteenth cen
tury was there a civil law making heresy a
capital crime, and that this law was made by
an Emperor notoriously hostile to tbe Popes.
I showed that St. Thomas was considering
the question whether heretics might be left to
the civil magistrate to suffer the death penalty,'
which is a very different thing from saying
that heretics ought to be put to death or that
the church should deliver them over to Civil
power,
1 showed, â¢ finally, that this teaching of
Aquinas was not a dogma of the church, but
that it was his opinion as to how a certain
state of the civil laws should be met. No word
can be produced from Aquinas urging that
such civil laws should be made or should be
enforced. He merely took things as he found
them. He had no responsibility for making
them, and thorefore should not be blamed for
their cruelty.
Dr. Wendte replied how much nicer it would
be to say that this intolerance of Aquinas was .
once the universal doctrine of the cnurch, but
we have outgrown it.
It might be much nicer to say it, but it would
not be true.
There is no doctrine of the church, and never
was, which teaches that heretics should be put
to death. i
That Aquinas was intolerant I do not be
lieve. The fact that he explains the civil law
on the punishment of heretics makes him no
more intolerant than the fact that a modern
lawyer who explains the civil law on electrocu
tion makes him bloodthirsty.
(6) BELLARMINE ON HERETICS. â¢
The history of the Harvard notes has already
been set forth at length. Dr. Wendte, how
ever, produced another quotation showing
that Bellarmine was a ferocious heretic-hunter.
By means of the deadly parallel I demon
strated that Dr. .Wendte had gerrymandered
Bellarmine and thatÃellarmine's doctrine was
precisely that of Aquinas', namely, that the
civil power, not the church, punished them
with death.
Dr. Wendte replied that I had not put the
right passages in the parallel column and that
I should not sneer at his Latiuity.
I assert again that I did produce the exact
passage and I assert, too, that Dr. Wendte
never saw a volume of Bellarmine and that I
believe he could not read it if he did. There is
no occasion to sneer at his Latin. He does not
know enough to write a prescription for a sick
cow. A schoolboy who could write "semper
idem" of the church would deserve to he
scourged within an inch of his life for scan
dalous disregard of the rules of gender.
(c) URBAN II AND THE EXCOMMUNICATE. .
Dr. Wendte asserted that the Jesuits in justi
fying the killing of heretic kings appealed to
a decree of Urban II allowing the slaughter of
those that have been excommunicated. -" * *
: I challenged Dr. Wendte to produce the pas
sage in which the Jesuits made this appeal.
Dr. Wendte replied: "I am glad to say that
I am not an adept in casuist Catholic litera
ture. It is a most useless knowledge." .
It would have been particularly useful to Dr.
â¢Wendte just then in order to prove that he did
not say the thing that was not.
I showed that Dr. Wendte knew nothing
about this passage of Dr. Wendte; that it re
ferred to the disturbers of the public peace,
and, that instead of being a Papal bull, it was
only a Unitarian calf.
Dr. Wendte .yells: "My scholarship is evi
dently causing Father Yorke much tre
pidation." . . 'â .'â â .'_
(d) THE JESUITS ON REGICIDE.
Dr. Wendte declared that the Jesuits" taught
that heretical kings might be killed at sight.
I showed that Dr. Wendte falsified Suarez,
confounded extracts from two different books
into one alleged quotation, and that the teach
ing of the Jesuits, surrounded as it was by con
ditions, was nothing more or less than the
teaching set forth in the Declaration of Inde
pendence.
Dr. Wendte answered that I wandered off. into
discursive explanations which explain noth
ing.. ;â¢ >".'â ;. 'â 
(C) CATHOLIC* AND PROTESTANT PERSECUTIONS
COMPARED. ,
I stated that in the matter "of toleration the
Catholic church might challenge comparison
with any denomination. .
Dr. Wendte replies that Protestant persecu
tions were never so sanguinary as Catholic
persecutions, and in proof he quotes the In
quisition, the Albigenses, St. Bartholomew
etc. ' ..'.' â  ,':.-â â¢â -.*
. Let us see' what his proofs are worth.

Hamilton's "History of Quarter sessions from
Elizabeth to Anne" gives for the year 1593 800
---executions in the forty English counties.
Mackav's "Curious Superstitions" is authority
for the statement that under a law passed
through the influence of John Knox 17,000
witches were burned in Scotland up to the ac
cession of James I. Between 1600 and 1680 40,
---000 supposed witches perished in England.
During the Long Parliament 3000 of these un
fortunates were done away with.
The crime of witchcraft was only one of
those which came before the Inquisition. Let
us compare Llorente's 32,000 executions 1n330
years for heresy, murder, witchcraft, adultery,
etc., with the 40.000 English witches in 80
years, and we may well say that bad as the in

"WAY FOR THE KING ! M
The California Shirtâ the STAND-
ARDâ is King, If excellence of ma-
terial and workmanship count for
anything. Are you patriotic? ynuisition was in Catholic Spain there were tri
bunals infinitely worse in Protestant England.
Moreover we have a fair test of the relative
cruelty of Protestant and Catholic persecu
tion for religion by comparing the doings of
the Inquisition with the doings of Elizabeth-
Good Queen Bess. Taking the number of ex
ecutions by the Inquisition during that reign
for all causes we find they amount. to 1700.
Now we. know that in England over 14,000
English priests alone perished during the
reign of that virgin tyrant.
Two hundred died on the scaffold and 1200
wore shot down like carrion crows, while no
one knows how many perished in the filthy
prisons into which they were plunged. This
calculation does not take into account the
laymen and women who suffered the extreme
penalty for their faith. Indeed, if we had a
complete record of all the Catholics put to
death during that one reign, even Llorente's
figures would pale into insignificance.
1 might add that, while we have not on record
a single expression of reproof from a Protestant
ecclesiastic against the proceedings of Eliza
beth, we have on record the protests of Popes
against the cruelties of the Inquisition. Lecky
himself, who is not our friend, distinctly say's
in a sentence, half of which Dr. Wendte
characteristically suppresses, bears testimony
to the intervention of the Popes: "One or two
Popes endeavored to moderate its severities,
and reproved the excesses of Torquemada in
language that is not without something of
evangelical mildness." 1
Again, though Erasmus, according to Lecky,
endeavored to assuage persecution, though
Alphouso di Castro's protest stayed the hand
of Bonner in the reign of Mary, Lecky is able
td say: "Among the Protestants it may, I be
lieve*' be safely affirmed that there was 'no ex
ample of the consistent advocacy or practice of
toleration in the sixteenth century that was
not virulently and generally denounced by all
sections of the clergy."
2. The Huguenots. Dr. Wendte produces the
Huguenots and the massacre of St. Bartholo
mew to keep company with the Inquisition. Dr
endte, however, is careful not to say that the
Huguenots inflicted as much persecution as
ever they received.
The Catholic majority was disposed to grant
toleration, but as Mr. Buckle remarks of them
the Huguenots "were not content to exercise
their own religion unless they could also
trouble the. religion of the others." And in
another place he remarks, "Whatever may be
the popular notion respecting, the necessary
intolerance of the Catholics, it is an indisputa
ble fact that, early in the seventeenth cen
tury, they displayed In France a- spirit of for
bearance and Christian charity to which the
Protestants could make no pretense." V-'
During the ten years before the massacre of
St. Bartholomew the Catholics had been mur
dered *}? cold blood and with circumstances
of deliberate cruelty at Orleans, Le Mans,
Troyes, Tours, Bayeux, Angers, r Bourges.
Rouen, Macon, La Rochelle, Grenoble, Poi
tiers and many other towns. . *
At Nimes on Michaelmas day, 1567, the
Huguenots led out their victims from the Ho
tel del Mile one by one, cut their throats and
cast their bodies into a deep well. - -
I do not offer these facts as an excuse for St.
Bartholomew's day, but as a proof that Dr.
Vn endte s ancestors were not the injured inno
cents some would nave them to be. -
Dr. Wendte speaks of a Pope as giving thanks
for the massacre. It is true that the Pope did
give thanks, but it is just as true that the real
nature of the massacre was withheld from him
He was given a version of the tragedy, which
led him to believe that the Huguenots had
been detected in a treacherous design on the
French King and had been defeated.
This version was believed by Philip of Spain
and Elizabeth of England. We need not won
der that it was believed by Gregory XIII It
was for the preservation of the French King
and not for the massacre of the Huguenots
that he gave public thanks,
r 3. Albigentes. Having now offset the Inquisi
tion with England and the Huguenot with
Huguenot we can pile the Dutch and the Al
bigenses together and set them against Ire
land, and Dutch and Albigenses together will
kick the beam. Moreover, we have left still
Scotland, Scandinavia, Denmark, the English
colonies and Geneva to put over against any
new Catholic atrocities which Dr. Wendte may
discover. I think that the unprejudiced histo
rian will find that though the denominations
have only a history of 300 years they have
succeeded in spilling more blood in that pe
riod than the Catholic church throughout all
her existence,
if) MARYLAND.
Dr. Wendte tries to make it out that the Cath
olics of Maryland were compelled to grant
toleration through necessity, not through
choice.
If this hypothesis be true, why was not the
condition insisted on in the grant? The grant
was the largest and most liberal ever given to
any colony, and the proprietor had full liberty
to exclude all but Catholics if he wished to
do so.
Dr. Wendte cannot argue against a fact The
first example of toleration on these shores was
given by Catholics, and no Catholic either
then or since protested against it,
. _ ) ECUADOR.
Dr. Wendte produces what he calls
â¢ the concordat of 1863 with Ecuador. Until
.be gives his authority for the* authentic
â Hy of that document I decline to consider it.
-have had too many bogus bulls and papal
documents palmed oft on me in this contro
versy. I cannot reasonably admit this new
specimen until Dr. Wendte authenticates it.
3. FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND OF THE PRESS.
Dr. Wendte said the Pones were opposed to
freedom of speech and of the press.
I answered that the condemnations which he
quoted were directed against precisely that
license of speaking or printing against which
our own constitution provides by libel and
slander suits and by the suppression of im
moral books.
Dr. Wendte replied, "I am a very busy man."
4. THE JESUITS.
Dr. Wendte speaks of the expulsion of the
Jesuits from several countries for their politi
cal intrigues. " Dr. Wendte is rapidly learning
the terminology of the A. P. A. I assert now,
and I am prepared to prove ft, that in every
case the Jesuits have been expelled, they
have been expelled in defiance of the princi
ples of justice and liberty. Theenemies of the
Jesuits in every land have been the enemies
of society, and constitutional freedom.
5. CATHOLICS AND REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS.
Dr. Wendte says that Catholicism favors
monarchy and- Protestantism republicanism.
If this is so, how is it that every Catholic coun
try on this continent is a repuDlic? How is it
that the great Catholic nation of France is a
republic? Why is not England, or Prussia, or
Norway or Sweden a republic? The fact is,
and history proves it, that the triumph of
Protestantism meant everywhere and always
the triumph of despotism.
6. CATHOLIC LEARNING AND PROTESTANT SCHOL
ARSHIP.
Dr. Wendte has expressed the opinion that
we Catholics are but poor, ignorant dolts and
that the brains of .the church have been Prot
estant converts.
The only reply that I will make to that asser
tion is to quote against Dr. Wendte one of the
converts he mentions, Brownson. He says:
"I have as a Catholic felt and enjoyed a
mental freedom which I never conceived pos
sible while I was a non-Catholic" (Vol. 5, p.
185.)
"I have known long and well the Protestant
clergy in the United States, and I am by no
means disposed to underrate their abilities or
their learning and science, and although I
think the present generation of ministers falls
far below its predecessors, I esteem highly the
contributions they have made and are making
to the literature and science of our common
country; but our Catholic clergy, below in
many respects what for various reasons they
should be, can compare more than favorably
with them in the correct and classic use of the
English language.
"They surpass them as a body, in logical
CHARLES M. ROUSSEAU'S DESIGN FOR THE NEW MUNICIPAL. BUILDING.
training, in theological science.in ihe|accuracy
and, not unfrequently, in the extent of their
erudition. Indeed," It have found among
Catholics a higher ; tone of thought, morals,
manners and society than I have ever found,
with fair opportunities, among my non-Catho
lic countrymen, and taking the Catholic popu
lation of the country -even as it actually is,'
under all its disadvantages, there is nothing in
it that need make the most cultivated and
renned man of letters or of society blush to
avow himself a Catholic. (lb. p. 188).
'Compare an Irish or Spanish peasant with
an English or German" peasant, the learned
Benedictines of St. Maur or* the Bollanaists
witn your most erudite scholars or critics, or
the. great medieval doctors with your most
lauded Protestant theologians, . the â . difference
in mental lucidity, acuteness and strength is
so great as to render all comparison almost
ridiculous." : (Vol. 8, p. 443.) -
. Such is Brownson's answer to Dr. Wendte. 7.
: PERSONALITIES.
'â â  I assure you, Mr. Editor, that I consider it a
waste of valuable space to spend time in mere
personalities. ;As far as possible I have tried
to keep my private affairs out of this discus
sion. I have not produced my cook and my
tailor as authorities in theology, nor have I
troubled, the public with a catalogue of my
Protestant friends. 1 have not been so im
pertinent as to hint that Dr. Wendte is- a late
convert to Unitarianism. I have not paraded
Erivate letters to strengthen my argument, 1
aye not suggested that my opponent entered
this controversy through base or unworthy
motives.
. All these things Dr. Wendte has done while
proclaiming his superiority to me as a Chris
tian and as a gentleman. If therefore I do
waste some of your valuable space in discuss
ing personalities to-day. Mr. Editor, I claim
that I am but following the example of one
who in his oft-expressed opinion is a model of
manners controversial.
In the first place, therefore allow me to re
sent the imputation which Dr. Wendte would
fasten on me that I am a hater of Protestants.
I do not think that anything which I have I
said or written would lay me open to that
charge. In all this discussion I have not
spoken of the great - Protestant community ex
cept to appeal to its sense of justice against the
tactics of Dr. Wendte.
I have not beslavered Protestants with com
f>liments as Dr. Wendte has beslavered â¢ Catho
ics. My silence was sincere. Dr. Wendte's
effusiveness was insincere. If I accused Amer
ican Protestantism of disloyalty would the
sting be taken from the calumny because I said
I believe that Protestants are truly . loyal? If
I accused Dr. Wendte's caste or unfairness,
forgery and the suppression ot truth, would I
make amends by calling Dr. Wendte manly?
If I called the members of the Protestant
churches ignorant would I undo the effect of
my charge by saying I am acquainted with
some very estimable Protestants? No, Dr.
Wendte, I have said nothing in praise of Pro
testants because I have sail nothing in v blame
of Protestants. I have not patted them on the
shoulder with' one hand nor picked their
pocket with the other.
My contention has been with you and with
your authorities. When I said certain tactics
were dishonest I meant your tactics. When I
said quotations were garbled I meant that you
garbled them. When I said that Protestant
scholarship was a humbug I. meant your
scholarship, and â  when I spoke of crass and
supine ignorance concerning Catholic doc
trine I meant the crass and supine . ignorance
of which you gave evidence. -â¢
If this controversy is to descend to person
alities let it be understood here and now that
there are only two persons concerned in it â
you and I. Ido not intend to be placed in the
unenviable position of making war on Protes
tants. All through this controversy I have
acted on the defensive. You came into the
controversy of your own free will. What were
the motives which animated you it is not for
me to say.. How you retire from it is not my
part to describe. But I cannot allow, you to
wrap yourself in Csesar's mantle and point to
the envious rents as the reason for which you
retire. You retire as you came in. your own
master, and I protest against tne high-handed
impudence which would place in my manners
the reason for retiring from the field.
Let me say right here, Dr. Wendte, that there
is no reason in the wide world for recognizing
you as an advocate of Protestantism. If I re
member aright some years ago the Protestant
ministers of Oakland denied your claim to the
title of Christian and refused to allow you to
participate in their Monday meetings. That
you lost anything by your exclusion from that
weekly rendition of Mother Goose's melodies
Ido not believe. It is true that since this con
troversy broke out they have asked you back.
I would have thought more of you if you had
said nothing about the invitation.' It does not
prove that they recognize you as a Protestant
or a champion .of Protestantism, but proves
that they think that any stick is good enough
to beat a yellow dog.
Let me here resent another invidious dis
tinction which Dr. Wendte would inflict upon
me. He insists on singling: me out from my
brother -priests" and calling me a good and
loyal citizen, as though other priests were not
as good citizens and as loyal. Allow me to in
form Dr. Wendte that I repudiate his enco
miums. My honoris trie honor of my brethren,
and what Insults them, insults me. .When he
sneers at them as the humble vassals of Rome
he sneers at me. By the grace jof God lam a
member of the Catholic clergy. I disown any
attempt to make me an exception to them. If
I am in any way loyal, they are far more loyal.
If I am a good citizen they are far better. They
spend themselves and are spent in ministering
to the needs of the poor, and it sounds well for
the chaplain of Dives . to snarl at those who
bind up the sores ot Lazarus. .â .".'. Â»
The loyalty of Catholic priests is not hall
marked by the utterances of the ministry of a
sect which ministry has never shown that it
was more loyal or more devoted than the
clergy of any. other sect. The loyalty of
Catholic priests is witnessed not only by words
but by deeds. Their patriotism is told in the
lives of John Carroll and of John Hughes.
Their allegiance was manifested in the Civil
War before I was born and their devotion is
marked by the marole shafts under which lie
the priests who fell beneath the â¢ yellow fever
or the small pox, ' as the sentinel falls at his
post, as the captain goes down with his ship,
as the shepherd who is not a hireling, whose
own the sheep are, knows that greater love
than this no man hath that he lay down his
life for his friend. â  â â  :.
And now I bring this long letter to a close.
Dr. Wendte may make as many farewell ap
pearances as a prima donna, and if he produces
anything new I suppose 1 shall have the
liberty of answering ft. I regret that the con
troversy does not end as it began; but Dr.
Wendte is responsible. He has charged the
Catholic community with a crime which they
repudiate, and, though their innocence has
been proven clear as light, he prefers to claim
a barren controversial victory to their good
name. Yours truly, P. C. Yobke.

Red Glen Beat Ed Kearney a Nose in
the Most Exciting Finish of
the Day.
Car after car rolled up to the entrance of
the Ingleside track yesterday loaded down
with passengers. The delightful weather
drew the fair sex out in ; vast numbers.
The Australian starting machine was a
novelty. The . poolrooms are on the brink
of starvation, and these two features
helped to swell the numbers of the male
portion of the assemblage. The pro
gramme was an ; excellent one, and alto
gether it was without question the most
successful of the [ ladies' days inaugurated
by the management of the new track. The
fair plungers in the j grand stand indulged
in some fierce wagering, and the hapless
man that strolled into. the grand stand
without being the possessor of a tip soon
found himself isolated. --' -7-

more or less support, but the expected
lone shot failed to materialize, favorites

the hurdle race; but the riders luckily es
caped without serious injury.
; -The Australian starting-gate was used to
dispatch two of the fields. The first at
tempt resulted in a very pretty. start, but
at "i the 7 second trial, in the last * race,"
Nephew / managed : to s carry * the ; webbing
away with him, not, however, spoiling the
start, which was a good one. .<*: When the
jockeys become more accustomed to the
new device there is no doubt of its success.
â¢ The = opening [â â¢ mile 7 dash,' ; with 7 seven
starters, saw Gratify go to the post a hot
7to 10 favorite. He ran in second posi
tion until the stretch was reached, when
he drew away and won ; easily by three
lengths from Oakland. Pecksniff â  once
more finished in the show.
7 The next event, a six-furlong spin, was
a very lively and open-betting affair.
Hermanita finally closed a slight favorite
over imp. Fullerton Lass, going to the
post 13 to 5. Audimere and Myrtle H
made most of the running ' until nearing
the stretch. Monitor there took,, the lead
and in a drive. beat the 60 to 1 shot, Hunts
man, out half a length. "Poorly ridden by
Martin, the favorite was a close third.
The third event on the card was also a
six-furlong : run. The Corrigan entry,
Kowaisky, with Tod Sloan up, ruled a 4 to
5 favorite, and, always out in front,. won
easily at the end by two lengths from
Pique.' Minnie Ccc was a good third.
. There was the hottest kind of a tip out
on the. Corrigan jumper Contentment to
win the mile and a quarter j hurdle event,
and a world of coin went into the books on
him at 2 to 1 and 9 to: 5. 7 There were nine
starters in the affair and the field presented
a very pretty sight. While making rapid
strides toward the front the first choice,
who was ridden by Andy Biakeley, fell" tak
ing the fourth jump. â¢ Arctic, who had
been in the lead from the jump,' won clev
erly by a head from Arundel. The winner
was as good as 7 to 1 in the betting.
A seven-furlong condition race allowed
Bellicoso to get in at ninety-seven pounds,
and the I half brother, to : Crescendo was a
warm 13 to 20 chance around post time.
Racing out in the lead, under restraint
must of the way, he won romping from
the 9 to 5 second choice Logan, who- did
not fare as well as the winner at tllag-fall.
Thelma at 20 to 1 was a creditable third. <
The last race on the card was a selling
event over a mile " for the > better ; class of
, selling platers. It was the swell ; betting
affair of the day. Bueno backed from threes
to 2to 1 was '"the post favorite, with Ed
Kearney: at 3 a shade: shorter than Red
Glen in ? the books for second choice ' hon
ors.r'|, ; 7:..:-7;; 777 â â â â  777 .:â  77 ~['.'Â£
. When the gate sent the field away, Lumle
took- -Ed: Kearney out in front and it
looked as though- he intended making J a
runaway race of it. Coady on Red Glen
made his 'â¢ ride in the stretch; and in a
rattling drive ' beat Kearney out a nose.
Basso finished .third. ; . â¢',-"*

--; - On Monday Little : Cripple won a mile
and a furlong race in 1:56% very easily,
ridden by Tod Sloan. Yesterday he ran
in a mile race with but three pounds more
weight (: up and * the judges apparently
thought he ran his race when he wound
up fourth, behind Basso. Many of \ the
inhabitants of this - "bush" country," who
are gradually becoming enlightened by the
importation of learned racing officials, do
â¢ not. t The horse was so "tired" when pulled
up that be wanted to run away, the reverse
way of the track, with Sloan. The horse's
owner did not like the showing his horse
made, and was \ informed by Sloan S that
his saddle slipped. -The odds against him
also slipped, for he went back from 3 to 7
to 1.7 Basso ran in the race won by Little
Cripple on- Monday, carrying less weight,
and was unplaced. ... s -."
ROWING OVER MORELLO
An Attachment Suit Which
Caused Considerable
. ; ' '.'_. . Trouble.
Ash and Chretien Say Perjury Has
Been Committed Mistaken
- Writ.
The horse Morello has again, in a figura
tive sense, .appeared in court, and . this
time with much more excitement than
before. â¢ 7 - ,s _-7.
'â¢*! During the afternoon a suit on a promis
sory note made by Vim Ness, who is being
sued for the horse, in favor of Louis Larn
mertz, who is suing for the horse. It is
for $1600. ""' '7;
When the suit was filed an attachment
was asked for, and the object of the at
tachment was the horse. The affidavit on
attachment' was made upon a blank from
the Justices'- courts . but this was passed
in the rush of business in the clerk's office,
and the writ of attachment was issued.
No sooner was the complaint filed than
Porter Ashe and John Chretien were out
in the County Clerk's office investigating
and trying to have the writ set aside.
â¢ The note was ' made in Chicago and was
made payable in Chicago, but the affidavit
set forth that the obligation was contracted
and J was due in this State. Samuel ' H.
Beckett,- to whom the claim had been as
igned. was the affiant and plaintiff, and
Mr. Chretien and Mr. Ashe both agreed he
had committed perjury. They say the
County Clerk had no right to" issue any
writ upon such a complaint, and they
went before Judge Seawell to have him set
it aside, but he would not do so until all
parties could be present.
During; the morning Judge Seawell had
vacated the injunction which the suers for
the horse had secured and which prevented
the Sheriff -of Sonoma County from turn
ing the horse over to Van. Ness. This was
done because the court deemed sufficient
the bond to which the plaintiffs in the suit
objected. .7 1.,,.
Porter Ashe objected to any delay, as he
feared the plaintiffs would secure a writ of
review from the Supreme Court, and so he
intended to go to Sonoma on the 5:10
train and secure the horse, In the mean
time, .however, the attachment suit : had
been commenced, and the horse could be
held under it lone enough to allow of the
application for the writ of review being
filed; and to tie up the horse for an in
definite time. J. J. West, who filed the
suit for attachment, and who is an asso
ciate of Abraham Ruef, counsel for those
who are suing for possession of the horse,
assured opposing counsel, however, that
no writ of review would be sought, and so
tue'case was fallowed to lapse until this
morning, when Judge Seawell will hear it.
It is claimed by the plaintiffs in the suit
that Van Ness wishes to keep possession
of the horse until the breeding' season is
over. This belief is strengtnened by the
fact that Jack Reiss, Ed Corrigau's right
hand man,: is putting up, through the
Pacific Surety Company, the $20,000 to se
cure the delivery of the horse, should the
case go against Van Ness. .
Ashe says he will have Beckett before
the Grand Jury for purjury, committed in
his affidavit on attachment. ..' â

POTTER'S FRIEND FOUND
Dr. A. G. Hicks Dined With Him
' at the Cliff on the Fatal
Friday. -
THINKS HE FELL IN THE DARK.
Tale of His Last CarouseâLocal Police
Disappointed by Failure of
a Clew.
The following telegram, received last
night from Tacoma, turns considerable
light on the closing hours in the life of H.
Cranston Potter of Tacoma,whose body was
found in the surf at the ocean beach on Sun
day . -'â  " '" . v\ "
TACOMA. Wash., Feb. 12.â Dr. A. G. Hicks,
who was with Howard Cranston Potter on the
trip in San Francisco which ended fatally for
Potter,- arrived this evening from San Fran
cisco.
It was he that dined with Potter at the Cliff
House on that Friday night.
"We finished dinner about 7:30," said he
this evening. "Potter wasn't intoxicated:
neither was I. We had a quart bottle of cham
pagne together at dinner. He was slightly
obstinate, and when I suggested that we go
back to the City and attend the theater he de
murred. He didn't want to go to the theater.
Then -I wanted to go back on the cable, but he
wanted to go back on the steamcars, to board
which would necessitate going down the hill
and over the place where grading is being done.
"He would not go on the cable, but started
downhill for the steam cars. 1 1 hurried off and
caught the cable-car leaving at 7:45.
"1 believe that Potter, in the darkness, lost
the road and went over the cliff. A man. who
never touched liquor would be liable to do the
same in the dark."
Hicks denies that Potter led a swift life while
In the City, and is positive that there was no
woman in the case.
Captain Lees- still adbereo to the opinion
that Potter was accidentally drowned, and
in. support thereof points to the fact that
Dr. Barrett, who made the autopsy on the
body, found the lungs full of water. If he
had been . murdered and his body thrown
into the sea there would have been an ab
sense 'of water in the lungs. The bruises
on the hips and elbows of the body also
showed that it had been tossed about by
the action of the surf.
''The statement," said the captain last
night, "tbat Potter was seen talking to
some one on Market street on Saturday by
a Mr. Hood has been proved to be a mis
take on the part of Mr. Hood.
"What could hayÂ« been the motive for a
murder? Potter's watch, silver watch
box and purse were found in the pockets
of v his clothes. True, there was only 10
cents in the purse, but it was shown by
Christiansen, the barkeeper at the Cliff
House, that Potter asked him if he could
lend him $5, which, however, he did not
get."
The captain believes that, after leaving
the Cliff House, Potter wandered down to
the beach, and in his intoxicated condition
got into the surf and was lifted off his feet
by the undertow and was drowned. It' is
probable tha.t be may have stumbled into
a quicksand, and was drowned while at
tempting to extricate himself. .
Captain. Lees said last night that he ex
pected a man to call who might be able to
throw some light upon the affair. He
waited till close upon" 10 o'clock, but the
man did not make his appearance. The
captain said he would be sure to turn up
this morning. He declined to say who
the man was or what he was expected to
tell.
A gentleman called at police headquar
ters last evening. He said he was a friend
of Potter's family and he was anxious to
get the facts about his death so that he
could write to the family. Detective : Gib
son gave him all the facts in the posses
sion of the police.. â  " 7
The inquest on the body will be held at
the Morgue this morning at 10 o'clock.

Explanation.
The arrow files with the wind. The top figures
at station Indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath It, If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow In Inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hish" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: . "low"
r*fers to low. pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by clondv weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
crast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
till produce an opposite result.

THINGS THAT INTERESTED HIM.
A Harvard Professor Selects Topics the
Students Discuss.
So far has the dispute over the election of
Dean to the captaincy of the Harvard
eleven gone , that one of the.most promi
nent members of the Harvard faculty, Pro
fessor : Barrett Wendell 'â - of the V English,
department, considered it a fit' subject for |
a talk to one of his classes. .;
There have been a great many expres
sion, of opinion among the 1 students =in
their daily, themes which V came under
Professor Wen-ell's: notice, and naturally
he had his own, opinion on, the subject. Â.â¢;",
9He confessed at the start that: he J knew
nothing about the two candidates, person
ally, and was perfectly unprejudiced. He
said that there was much in the argument
that 'a * born leader rather i than : a good
player should lead a team. â ',' '- â â 'â¢'. â 'â¢'â  i r-~~ : 'iz i
"It â '; is ;' not ; necessary,'' said ..; Professor
Wendell, 7"for. the manager jof an opera
company to be a good player, himself."
This, of course, showed at once where â¢ the
; professor's preference lay. 7 ;- ; -""' C '7
7 Then' he went on to show that the fact
that "Dean is a- college j society/: man aud
Scannel is not snoula not necessarily act
against Dean. ; "In truth,'." said Professor
Wendell, "those qualities which fit a man
for leadership in life are most often found
in * society men. The men . who make so
cieties make A them ;, because they have a
kind of sympathetic touch â a way of win
ning ] themselves into the good graces of
their companions â which is sure to; count
for, them in later life. 7 On the other hand,
the men who ' fail to make societies are
those who : have" some eccentricity which
makes their company disagreeable to their
classmates.
/ MOf /course," â¢ the professor continued,
"there is no hard and fast rule to be laid
down, but if you look through the quin
quinnial catalogue you will find, I dare
say, that four out of five Harvard men who
have attained some eminence in the world
are those men who were seciety men in
college. â¢ â¢'. ";â¢â¢.â¢-. Â» -
% "It is a fact that the men who enter the
freshman class who are going to amount to
anything in after life will- be found to be
society men by their junior year."
â¢ It is unnecessary to add that there was
more than one smile of 'disapproval in the
large room, which was filled with students.
When Professor Wendell said later on that
he admired the manly spirit which Scan
nel showed in the letter he wrote to The
Crimson and that it ,was an example of
good breeding: and â¢' gentleman liness there
was loud applause and a stamping of feetâ
a most unusual occurrence in a Harvard
classroom, and especially in Professor Wen
dell's classroom.â Boston Globe.
Geographies to Blame.
Ask any hundred English men, women
or children what is the name of the capital
of Russia, and every- one of them will re
ply "St. Petersburg.": It may be a small
matter, but ** in point of fact ' the s proper
name is "Petersburg." The English '. are
the only folk who insist upon the "Saint."
The city was founded by Peter the Great,
and is named after him' It is quite true
that Peter was one of the most extraordin
ary men that ever filled a throne, but no
one would have been more astounded than
himself at being dubbed a saint. . He
neither lived nor died in the odor of sanc
tity, and it is hard to find out how it be
came the English fashion to miscall the
splendid town he founded.â Folks.

THE GAS DID NOT SPARK
Its Failure to Do So Nearly

Life.
HE MARRIED HIS ' SAVIOR.*
Several Attractions Are Being Ar
ranged for the Observance of
7 Washington's Day.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, Feb. 12, 1896. j"
Charles F. Taenzer of Thirteenth avenue
played with a patent gaslighter last night
and this morning he was discovered in his
bed unconscious. His ignorance of the
manner in which the machine works nearly
cost him his life.
Taenzer is an assistant in the butcher
shop at 1121 Thirteenth avenue. Last night
he retired as usual, and as he was not
around at the regular lime this morning
his room was entered and it was found to
be full of gas. Taenzer was almost dead
and he was at once taken into the air and
nil the usual means of resuscitation were
used. Dr. Wentworth worked over the
asphyxiated man for several hours and
Taenzer was ultimately revived.
He said that when he went to his room
he pulled the patent lighting affair at
tached to the gas, but as it did not ignite
he paid no attention to it and retired in
, the dark. - He did not notice the smell of
gas in the room and quickly fell asleep.
An examination of the gasburner shows
that although the gas was turned on the
arrangement that should have caused the
spark was defective.
TWO CELEBRATIONS.
School Children and Y. M. I. to Appear
- in Good Programmes.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 12.â The spirit of
patriotism has spread rapidly among the
echool children in Oakland, and now all
are actively preparing for the parade and
demonstration on Washington's birthday.
Paul l"th will have charge of the move
ments of the children's division, and each
child will carry a flag.
While the ladies' cavalcade will be a
feature, the gentlemen are also astir, and
under the leadership of P. J. Keller will
turn out in force".
Thursday evening the large chorus will
rehearse in the parlors of the First Con
gregational Church, under the leadership
of D. P. Hughes.
Major E. A. Sherman, the Mexican war
veteran, will be one of the speakers at the
evening exercises.
Another feature of the parade will be a
representation of 'Uncle Bam" on â¢ horse
back, by Charles W. Corner, ex-license
inspector. Mr. Corner's birthday falls on
the22d, and this year he will be 70 years
old.
The programme of afternoon exercises
has been changed somewhat, so that in
stead of orations and other exercises on
the lake, the united bands will render an
open-air concert during the regatta. , A
barge will be anchored in the lake and ar
ranged to accomodate the bands.
The final movements of the parade will
be interesting. The school children, who
will be lined up on either side of Broad
way, will review the balance of the proces
sion and then in unison salute the flag.
The bands will simultaneously strike up
the National hymn and ail will join in the
singing. - ,

sist in the programme. Others will be
added during the week. The address of
the evening will be delivered by Rev. Ar

COUNTY RESOURCES.
Plans Being Pushed to Advertise Them
Throughout the East. .
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 12.â The State
Development Committee of San Francisco
have aroused considerable interest in this
county over the proposed plan of adver
tising Alameda County and its resources.
To begin with they have secured the ap
pointment of a committee of representa
tive citizens from all sections of the
county to have charge of the work.
This committee consists of Messrs. W. V.
Witcher, G. W. Asher. W. R. Dams, W.
H. Weilbye, C. R. Yates, G. L. Fish and
J. A. Remniel of Alameda; Mr.' Russell of
Haywards, H. H. Pitcher of Livermore
end J. L. Barker of Berkeley.
The committee organized by selecting
officers as follows: W. H. Weilbye, presi
dent; W. IV. Witcher, vice-president;
Webb N. Pearce, secretary. Â
The plan is to have a map published for
distribution throughout the Last. It is to
be a State map in colors showing the re
gions in which oranges, olives and other
semi-tropical products flourish. All of
these paid for by the funds raised by the
committee are to have upon the reverse
side a full description of the county's re
sources and products as well as a special
map of. Alameda County.
The plan adopted to raise the funds is to
request each town government as well as
â¢the- County Supervisors to appropriate
something.. Then individuals will be ap-
Sealed to for subscriptions. Messrs.
arker, : Remmel, Russell, Pitcher, Yates
and; two others to be named by Messrs.
Russell and .Pitcher for the parts of the
county not so far represented are to make
the appeal: ________
ASSESSOR'S PLAN'S. |
He Will Work Alone .Similar Lines as
: Those Used Last Year.
OAKLAND, Cai_, Feb. 12.â County As
sessor H. P. Dalton is making prepara
tions for the annual assessment of property
in the county; which will commence March
1. In speaking of the work to-day he said:'
"There will be no*rreat changes made in
the force of men who wilL do the work
this year.* The experience of It it year will
give me better control of matters this year,
bat I see no reason. why I should deviate
any from the lino I marked out last year.
I do not" anticipate- so much trouble this
year, because I : have the work better in'
hand and can, as a matter. of course, expe
dite it to better advantage."
Electric Road Extension! :
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 12.â The Oak
land, San , Leandro and Haywards electric

, Lincoln's Birthduy.
OAKLAND, - Cal., Feb. 12.â The birth
day of America's martyred President was
passed unnoticed here to-day by any pop
ular celebration. . - This absence of j proper
honors to one of the greatest men of > the
Nation has been observed and commented J
upon by some, and it may result in some- j
thing being done : next year. One reason
of the lack of ? note is the near approach of
Washington's Birthday, of which due note
will be taken. The public schools were the
only ones to celebrate the day. Here the
boys and - girls .were called upon to give
some ' incidents _ of his life and . history.
The plan resulted in a very enjoyable time
for the young people. â â â¢ ;.";;';.* I;
... 7 He Is Not Satisfied. ; '
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 12.â Antone Cle
cak, proprietor of the Louvre ; Saloon.
whose license was revoked Monday night
by the ! City Council, is to make an effort
to get his case reopened. He invited
â  Chief Lloyd to visit his place to see. how
orderly it was, but the Chief, after making
the inspection, told him the matter was
now in the hands of the Council and he
could do nothing for him. It is very prob
able Clecak willapply to the Council for a
new license, but it is believed the Mac
donough estate will oppose him.
Voting Men's league.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 12.â Rev. C. H.

OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 12.â Police Offi

quarters. Some time ago he secured Susie
Loza to come to his rooms | occasionally
and put them in order for him.
Sunday she found him almost asphyx
iated, and- with the prompt help she
secured he was resuscitated. He had â¢
been growing fonder of the lady every day,
and with this act he decided on a prompt
reward, so he gave himself to her.

Luigi Trofelli, the nephew and heir of
Lorenza i Gussi, or a Garibaldi, the old
gardener who was killed at Center-street
station by the engine of ; the local train as
it returned to the pier at midnight about a
year ago, was found dead in his room' this
morning. He ,; has , ,' been Am : partnership
"with Louis Ceselli on Seventh street up to
the first of the year, but since then ho has
been putting his time in seeing how much
sour wine he could drink. :
The deceased came into a portion of % the
estate left ;by the eccentric old gardener
and evidently could not stand prosperity.
He has been living in the old Garibaldi
house. ; Antonio .Valenceti,' his only com
panion during the night, is in the City
Prison, being held under suspicion of hav
ing had some hand in the man's death. 'â¢ He
declares, however, he knows nothing that
occurred after 11:30, when he retired leav-
Trofelli awake, owing to trouble with "- his
stomach. On | the body was found $38 50.
The body was removed to -the ; Morgue
and Deputy Coroner Quellen dressed it.
He found what appeared to be a bullet
wound in the vicinity of the navel. v He
notified the i officers who made the arrest.
He found a bullet hole in- the shirt and
undershirt and a wound ' that appeared to
be that of a bullet, but was unable to probe
it. On one leg was found some dried blood
and there was also a. little on his shirt, but
there does not seem to have been much ex
ternal hemorrhage. 7
Charles Lockren, who lives at 1457>_
Seventh street, , just around the corner
from Trofelli, says:
"I attended the Acme exhibition last
evening, reaching home -about 11 o'clock.
About 11:30 o'clock I heard a noise over at
Trofelli's as if some one had fallen or was
thrown down. I went out to the ' back
fence and looked over into Trofelli's yard.
I saw a man â not the deceased â come to
the door. He reeled as "if drunk. I did
not make any further investigation of the
case. I know that Trofelli had been drink
ing considerably of late, but he did not
cieate any great disturbance. I have often
seen men going to his place, one Sunday
there being six or seven.".
Valenceti, who is being restrained, is
about 40 years of age, and is well known
among the Italians of the city. He is un
able to speak English, but with the aid of
an interpreter the following statement was
secured: .
I "Last night when Troffelli and I retired
we were drunk. I slept in the bed and he
was on a cot on the floor in the same room.
About midnight I was awakened by a shot.
I was too drunk to pay any attention to it
and did not get up and investigate. This
morning when . I .:" awakened , I thought
Troffelli was still aslesp. . I shook him
and then discovered he was dead. I was
surprised and. thought that he must have
killed himself. - There was no one in the
house but Troffelli and myself when we
went to bed." ' -â¢ 7 'â 
â¢ A man. named Rosso, who resides at
869 Atlantic "street, was among the party
who spent the early evening with. Trofelli
and his associate. He has reported to the
officers that over two gallons of sour wine
was disposed of during the evening, and
that Trofelli threatened to commit suicide.
Further, he says the threat was not a new
one, but that he often made it when under
the influence of sour wine.
Trofelli came to Oakland from Stockton
after the death of his uncle. He was not
located until after the estate passed into
the hands of the Public Administrator.
Troielli and his brother succeeded in being
appointed administrators. The brother ii
now believed to be in Stockton. Deceased
was formerly a vegetable-gardener, and at
one time worked in San Mateo. '
The officers found ja. heavy revolver in
the bureau drawer to-day with one cham
ber empty. The matter is much ,of . a
mystery, and may. take some days to solve
satisfactorily. â  . xj

A HORSE IN THE CELLAR.
\ Exciting: End of a Runaway Horse From
Redwood Canyon. â¢
i . Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
.908 Broadway, Feb. 12. â¢ ) ..
.William Riley, whom all the citizens of
Redwood Canyon speak of so highly, made
a mistake last night. He was at Hay T
wards and the cautiousness which has
marked his career for many, years was not
followed. In. the end he may be called
upon to' provide Daniel Stuart of .Hay
wards with a horse and pay a bill incurred
for repairing a damaged buggy. 7 7 ,
Riley was in town all yesterday after
noon and toward evening he commenced
to tinge some of the most prominent sights
of Haywards a delicate j rouge. . As | time
wore â on the rouge deepened in tint and
eventually changed into a lustrous crim
. son.;;" 'â  .' â  A' - V . /A. . "
When advised to go home Mr.' Riley of
Redwood Canyon did as he was told, but
by some mistake he jumped into Dan
Stuart's buggy and drove off before the
owner could prove the mistake to the flee
ing Riley. Stuart jumped into another
buggy and gave chase. It was a wild ride.
The enthusiastic Riley saw Stnart behind
him, and being in the best of humor for a
spin, and knowing that he was on the
home stretch, he let out the reins with
marked liberality. Stuart also: whipped
up, and as his driving was more steady
than that of Riley he overtook ; the â  Red
wood man in the canyon. .- â¢-,
Then the trouble commenced. Just how
hostilities began ; has not been learned
beyond the shadow of a doubt,- but a few
minutes after the meeting Riley was
regretting that he had not taken the right
rig. â¢â¢ So excited were the two men tnat
their spirit was communicated to the team
that Mr. Riley had taken from Haywards.
The horses fumed and pawed and finally
look to their heels, and naif an hour later
dashed at full speed down the main street 1
of Haywards.;
At the corner of B and Castro streets the
team ran onto the sidewalk, and one of the
horses disappeared down the cellar en
trance to â  tne Louvre saloon. It was in- '
stantly killed and the other was badly
injured.
Mr. Rily took advantage of the oppor
tunity afforded by Mr. Stuart attending to
his runaway horses to jump into the other
buggy and go home. Mr. Stuart, being left
alone in the dark and the canyon, had to
walk back to Haywards. When he arrived
he heard of the accident to' his team, and
now he declares that he wants a new
horse, and Riley hints at recompense for
battery. 7
The two men are well known, and the
affair is being discussed in half the county.
AN UNSELFISH PRIEST.
Father Serda Uses Personal Gifts

An Item in His Annual Report That
Was a Surprise to His Par

Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
?:" 90S Broadway,. Feb. 12. fi:
J Rev. Father Berda; pastor of Temescal,
has reported to his church the financial
business of the past year. The report cre
ated some surprise on account "of the dis
play of unselfishness shown by the pastor.
At the conclusion of his report Father
Serda said: "This item of $325 needs a
word of explanation. You know that in
the middle of June last you celebrated
with me my silver jubilee. On that occa
sion you gave me several very fine gifts,
including a : purse of $325. \
"I received from you these gifts with
exceedingly great joy, especially as I know
that j they were given on a \ spontaneous
movement from your loving hearts.* Al
though handsome, indeed.. I appreciated
them, not so much for their value; as for
the expression of your love they repre
sented to me as your pastor, along . with
your congratulations. Thank God, I am
getting along .with the salary I received.
(Father Serda receives $750 year and
household expenses.] .
"Of course, if I had needed a suit of
clothes very, bad I would have bought me
one out of this money : but as I did not
need it I did with it what a good father
generally does with the gifts he receives
from his children. 1 turned the ; money
into the treasury of the church for your
own benefit. The other gifts being things
used in divine service will also remain in
the church. 71 was happy beyond expres
sion and the only thing I regret is, as I
was told, that many. people had to be sent
away, as- there : was- not standing-room
enough in the hall." . â¢ â¢ â 
About eight years ago Father Serda vis
ited his native place in Europe. "On that
occasion his parishioners, presented him
with a ; purse of $430.7 While in Paris he
bought a beautiful statue,. which cost $450,
and presented it to his parish. â  - -

BERKELEY BOND ELECTION
$200,000 Needed ; for Putting Up
School Buildings and a

Aid for Teachersâ Boy Who Tried
to Beat His Football
Advisory. Committee.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 12.â An election
will be held in Berkeley next Saturday,
the 15th inst., for the purpose of deciding
whether the town A shall be ; bonded for
$200,000, to be expended for the erection of
four new school buildings and a suitable
wharf at West Berkeley. 7 > . v' 1
; A; circular, setting forth the principles
involved in the erection of these improve
ments "was. issued to-day by the Good Gov
ernment Club, through tis committee,
consisting of James L. Barker, John H.
Foy and H. D. Irwin. Concerning the
schools the circular says:
The increase in the number of school chil
dren, as shown by the census during the past
five years, has been from 1162 to 2500.
The accommodations to-day, are totally de
ficient, and the yearly Increase, if adequate
provisions are made, will require double the
present capacity within the next five years.
The High School " has' had a phenomenal
growth, the enrollment increasing in five
years from 72 to over 300.
In .this department there are only four
rooms, with a capacity of 197, to accommodate
over 300 pupils, the number at present en
rolledâa sad commentary on the inadequate
aecommodatlpns of our rapidly growing
town." ' . . â¢ . â¢ .
Five years ago Berkeley was confronted with
a similar condition. - She met the emergency
by issuing bonds to provide the needed build
ings. The beneficial effect of such action has
been demonstrated by the tpwn's rapid growth
since that date, even during a period of ab
normal business depression.
Looking at the question as a business propo
sition, we can reasonably . expect that the is
suance of bonds will attract to Berkeley a very
! desirable class of citizens and that at least an
average of 150 families will be induced to
locate with us yearly, for the next live years.
This alone will surely increase our j taxable
valuation to cover the interest and pay oft' the
principal on the bond issue.
. The average assessed value of a lot in Berke
ley having a frontage of fifty feet will not ex
ceed $300, and the yearly tax on the same for
these proposed bonds will not exceed 30 cents
per lot.. â¢ . ..-.
In relation to the wharf the following
was said: T !rv ..v^ r 7
1. There are no 'â . public facilities at present
where dockage and wharfage at reasonable
. and uniform rates can ba secured. The wharf
which is in existence now is controlled by a
corporation which establishes dockage and
wharfage - rates in accordance with its own
ideas and to further its own business ends.
_. A right-of-way eighty feet in width to ship
channel is promised tree of charge at this time.
If Berkeley had to condemn a right-of-way,
the case could be kept in court for years, â  arid
finally, If successful, would cost a large amount
of money.
3. The" building of this wharf by the town
would guarantee to every one seeking.loca
tions fo* manufacturing or other industries
reasonable and uniform rates of dockage and
wharfage. We have many men in oar midst
able and willing to work, but unable to secure
it. Capital is very cautious, and we should do
all in our power to remove objections to its
investment in our town.
4. With the. establishing of manufacturing
and other industrial enterprises comes increase
in the taxable wealth of the town. Ââ â¢â¢â - ,â¢.*. ;
5. Statistics compiled show that during the
month of September, 1895,3000 tons of freight
passed over the : private 'wharf now in ex-.
istence, with its meager and unsatisfactory
facilities. With the building of the. proposed
wharf a better freight ferry system would in
all. probability .soon be inaugurated and the
above amount would be largely increased.
6. : A large proportion of: the merchandise
consumed in Berkeley is now hauled by team
from Oakland, a distance of five miles. In
j the matter of the handling of coal alone, from
Berkeley wharf instead of Oakland, a saving
of at least 50 cents per ton would be effected.
7. The voting of bonds for the wharf would
add to the taxes as follows:
For sinking fund each year, one-fortieth or
$80,000...... $2000
For interest first year, 5 percent on $80,000. 4000
Total : ."..... $6000
On the present assessed valuation of $8,500,
--000 this would add only about 70 cents on
the $1000, and this 'â  amount would decrease
each year because of the â¢ payments on the
principal and the - increase in : the assessed
valuation. It is safe to predict that within five
years the actual increase in taxation by reason
of the wharf bonds will not be more than 50
cents on the $1000.
8. Berkeley contains at least 12,000 inhabi
tants, and there are more than 5000 people
outside of Berkeley who would be tributary to
"the.proposed wharf.- The town has a long line
of water front and no public wharf s facilities.
With a population, rapidly increasing, num
bering 17,000 souls now tributary thereto, can
any one say that a substantial public wharf is
.not a necessity? 7 â¢ " â¢ - 7
These statistics and points of informa
tion are furnished through the Good Gov
ernment Club, which is made up* of repre
sentative citizens from various, parts of
Berkeley, and have > the indorsement of
the West Berkeley Progressive Club, a dis
tinctively West Berkeley institution. 77 ./
The Liquor Fight. ' ''77
BERKELEY, CALi;, Feb. 12.â The Berke
ley liquor; fight has not yet come to an
end. The decision of Judge Frick that the
ordinance under which the keepers of the
"Speak Easiest have been arrested is void,
has not ; been j accepted as final _by the
authorities of Berkeley. The liquor which
was confiscated when Marshal Lloyd made
his raids j a short time ago {is still kept at
the Town Hall and is still held as .evidence
that may yet be needed.
The case of 'Fred 'Fonzo, who was con
victed of the^ame charge as was Strieker,
whose appeal Judge Frick sustained, is now
pending 'on a.ppeal, and it is T ; said that
efforts will be made to - bring : it before
Judge Greene. Considerable unfavorable
comment ;is \ heard : in :, Berkeley among
those who are especially concerned the
matter, that Judge Frick's decision was
merely a' verbal one. The case :is of ex
treme importance to .Berkeley ; and those
concerned * would < like /to see * a -.written
decision, so that the points : upon ; which
it rests can be reviewed. v-Tne Town Board
has not yet taken any steps to frame a
new liquor ordinance, though if ; the old
one be finally defeated a new one will with
out doubt be passed at once. 7
The ; right ' has ; already been one which
has involved , considerable : ; expense for

There was a large attendance of mem

were read, to the edification and delight of
the audience. After Professor Harrison

Miss Adelaide Eiseh rendered a piano solo.
The first essay was upon the subject of

MURPHY STARTED EAST.
The Salem Man Who c Is Badly
Wanted for Bank
Theft."
TROUBLE OVER THE REWARD.
Judge Bahrs Denied â¢ Him Reliefâ He
Says. He Will Never Reach
Home Alive.
. Clarence M. Murphy, who : Is â¢ badly
wanted in Salem, Mass., for a bank theft,
started last evening under the care of Mar
shal Hart, who was sent out here for him.
His departure was made a few hoars after
Judge Bahrs had denied his application
for a writ of habeas corpus.
His attorney, Colonel Eddy, in applying
for the writ found error in the papers of
extradition in two placesâ the crime had
not been specified any more directly than
as larceny, "which might lead to the infer
ence that it was petty larceny, an offense
not extraditable, and the private secretary
of the Governor, and not the Governor
himself, had signed the warrant.
Judge Bahrs wrote an opinion on the
case, in which he answered both points.
As to the first one, he cited Supreme Court
cases to show that when the terms felony,
larceny or any other general term were
used it included all degrees of the crime
specified. As to the second point, he held
that the great seal of the State, which was
affixed to the warrant, was sufficient evi
dence of the ' approval of ' the Governor,
even though he himself had not signed the
document. He therefore denied the writ.
About 4:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon
City Marshal Hart of Salem and his deputy
went to the City Prison to take Murphy
: back with them. When they reached his
cell Hart said: "Well, Murphy, I have
come to take you back." '
"It will take a better man than you to
take me back," sneered Murphy. .
"All rieht," said Hart. "I will try it,
anyhow."
Murphy retorted by using an expression
more forcible than polite, and defied the
Marshal to take him out of the cell.
Captain Robinson, who was .present, or
dered three trusties to assist the Marshal
and bis deputy, and Murphy was dragged
out of the cell and the handcuffs slipped
over his wrists. Then no became quieter,
but remarked "to the.- Marshal, "You _1
never get me there alive."
As he was, leaving the prison Murphy
shouted, want it publicly known that
J. P. Allen has got a share of the reward
for my capture, â â him." ...'"â¢'.
The $500 check as a reward for Murphy's
capture was yesterday handed by Marshal
Hart to Private Detective Chappelle on
the understanding that he would divide
the money among those entitled 'to it.
There are . four claimants, J. P. Allen,
with whom Murphy and his wife lived at
462 Santa Clara avenue, Alameda: Attor
ney Gaston Straus, Private Detective
Chappelle and Policeman W. F. Brophv.
Allen learned through Murphy's wife
that her husband was a defaulter and he
communicated his. information to Attor
ney Straus. -An arrangement was made
that Murphy would meet Allen at - San
some and California streets on Friday,
January 31, and Chappelle was to be on
hand to arrest him. The programme was
carried out, but when Murphy was taken
to police headquarters he escaped from
the detectives' room by jumping out of
the window and was recaptured by Police
man Brophy, who made a claim for a
share of the reward and was backed up by
his superior officers. What disposition
Chappelle will make of the $500 remains to
be seen. ' â -â â¢-â¢â  .
Shot His Wife.
Charles Schopesa, a peddler living on Broad
way, shot his wife in the. hip yesterday noon.
He was arrested and charged with an assault
to commit murder. Several , days ago he beat
her almost to death with the same pistol.
Family troubles -" were the cause of both
assaults. The woman is not seriously
wounded. ... .... ,"7.>-'

Gladness Gomes
With a better understanding of the
transient nature of the many phys-
ical' ills which vanish before proper ef-
fortsâgentle effortsâ pleasant effortsâ
rightly directed. IJj There is 'comfort in
the knowledge that so many forms of
sickness are not due. to any actnal dis-
ease, hut simply to a constipated condi-
tion of the system,' which the pleasant
family laxative," Syrup of Figs, prompt-
ly removes. That is why it is the only
remedy with millions of families, and is
everywhere esteemed so highly by all
who value good -health. Its beneficial
effects are due to the fact, that it is the
one remedy which promotes internal
cleanliness, without debilitating the
organs on which it acts.' . It is therefore
all important, in order to get its bene-
ficial effects, to note when you pur-
chase, that you have the genuine article,
which is manufactured by the California
Fig Syrup Co. only, and sold by all rep-
utable druggists. . .
- If in the enjoyment of good health,
and the system is regular, then laxa-
tives or other remedies are not needed.
If afflicted with any actual disease, one
may be commended to the most skillful
physicians, but if in need of a laxative,
then one should have the best, and with
the well-informed everywhere, Syrup of
Figs stands highest and is most largely
used and gives most general satisfaction.

O'BRIEN ON JOB CHASERS
He Defines the Several Quali^
fixations of Some of the
Leaders.
_________ 7 *
THEY BELONG TO THE JUNTA.
â ':,'.'':: .. â :â }. â 'Â«' iy.-i^v-i*^": ''â ;_
. Buckley Is Solid Enough at the Occi
dental Club to Get Inside and
Give Advice.
Two souls with but a single thought, two
gangs that beat each one.
The Junta spends most of its time think
ing and reiterating that the Buckleyits are
not in it.
The Buckleyits spend the same amount
of time swearing that the Junta is not
in it."
"You see," said Jim O'Brien last night
at the Occidental Club,"Braunhart, Armes,
Sullivan and others of the Junta are sim
ply job-chasers. They know they are not
on earth and that we have got, the next
election practically in our hands. Why.
say, look at the whole works and every
man of prominence in the organization
has outlived his usefulness. "Look .at
Chairman Sullivan. I tell yon, that man
is- nothing more nor less than a mushroom
politician. They are all out of it with
Mr._ Buckley, and having wasted away as
political gladiators they assume to control
and reorganize the Democracy with colors
that no sensible Democrat will fight under.
Now, take Buckley, for instance -"
"Is Bucklev back in politics?" wasasked.
"Not exactly backâ that is, not distinctly
in charge of the party. But we allow him
to come into our meetings and advise â ad
vise, you understand. That is to say, he
is permitted, to talk matters over and
make suggestions, and we are glad to have
him."
""Will Buckley swing any influence in
the next campai_n ?" .
"Well, he's likely to be in town. Bnt to
continue in the matter of these job chasers.
They are all self-interest men, and when
the Junta begins to go to pieces you will
Bee them all begin to reach for some safe
spot where vhey will be above high water
and high tide. * They are well schooled in
the art of falling down at the critical time,
and if Sullivan does not make a better
Democratic leader here than a soldier at
Sacramento he will never get them up to
the political fence that they are anxious
io straddle.
"Listen to all this chatter about the
blanket ticket they propose to turn loose
for fear that we have some precincts that
they claim. Why. don't they come out
and right in the open and get at the polls
man to man and stick to their own dis
trict? We will go into the deal with them
on a dead-level basis and rive them the
hottest game they ever engaged in. Say,
between you and me, we have got the
whole works in the door. . Now, that's
Btraight."
"But," was asked of Mr. O'Brien, "will
it not be necessary for some faction to
compromise at a loss in order for the
Democracy to win out at all? The split
will make it impossible for the leaders to
carry the works unless terms are made
with the minority."
"That's right," that's right," broke in
O'Brien, "and they will be .the fellows to
get in and howl for terms. .If tbev don't
do that they will all get left in the shuffle;
and, mark my word, you will see them
breaking their necks to get in and square
things. Why, I tell yon," continued
O'Brien, with a smile on. his "face, "those
job-chasers are not on earth. We are the
strong wing of the Democracy, and when
the time comes we sweep the decks and
carry off the persimmons. Now, you can
state that for me, and when the hour ar
rives you will see a stampede from the
Junta that will look like a circus output."
Mr. O'Brien then answered a call from
another room and wended his wav up the
Ft ps. laughing and jesting about* the
Democratic remnant that calls itself the
Junta.
There was a meeting of district chair
men last night in the Buckley camp, and
it was pretty well understood 'that its ob
ject was to arrange for a little care at the
Junta primaries on the 22d in order to pre
vent what is known in . political parlance
as "repeating."
The board of director* of the Occidental
Club were holding a secret session with a
view to reorganizing the club and make
every member show his hand or go over to
the Junta, "where all the job-chasers be
long," as one politician put it.
Bncklpv is up at the farm ill with
bronchitis, but it is expected that he will
be able to drop down in a few days and see
the lambs, whose fondness for him equals
that of the celebrated young mutton that
remained by the side of one Mary, who
was in the habit of going to school oc
casionally.
W. H. Harrison, who was approached
by Jake Rudolph a few days ago, is not
able to understand why the officers permit
Rudolph to run at large with two six
fhocter pistols in his possession looking
for the scalps of inoffensive men. "He
has been gunning for me for the last three
years," said Harrison last night, "but I do
not propose to get 'done' if I can help it.
I do not care to get into a row. but I will
not run away from one."
THE RICHMOND DISTRICT.
A Mass-Meeting for the Discussion of
the New Charter.
At a recent meeting of the Richmond
District Improvement Association a move
ment was set on foot for the laying of side
walks from First avenue outtoTliirteenth
and on all of the cross-streets. When the
association met last evening a report from
the Superintendent of Streets was read, in
which that official said that 5000 feet of
plank sidewalk and 7423 feet of cement
sidewalks have been laid in the district
named. More will be put down as soon as
there are ways and means to do so.
Amotion was introduced that the asso
ciation advocate and urge the residents of
the district to patronize the Sntro electric
streetcar line in preference to others. The
motion was lost, the members deciding to
remain neutral in the matter of streetcar
lines. It was decided to send a communi
cation,to the Supervisors objecting to the
protest sent to that board against the bi
tnminizing of California street between
Maple and First avenue.
J. G. Maloney, E. O'Donnell and J. Mc-
Colgan were appointed to draft memorial
resolutions upon the death of James
J_Â»gue, a member of the organization. The
secretary was instructed to correspond
with the secretaries of all the improve
ment chubs in the City with a view to
calling a mass-meeting of the presidents
and secretaries to discuss the. proposed
new charter. It is the wish that all the
improvement clubs stand together, either
for or against the charter, when they de
cide whether its adoption will be a benefit
or an injury.

THE PRINCE AND
THE ANARCHIST
The . Preceptor of Carirot's
Assassin Follows Luigi *
of Savoy.
AT THE BALL together.
Pietro Gori, Revolutionist, Ap
â  pears Wherever the Royal * â¢"
Heir Is Seen.
HE TELLS OF SANTO CiESARIO.
i â¢
His Peaceful Mission Is .to Teach
Social Evolution â Interviewed
by a',' 'Call" Reporter.
On the evening before Prince Luigi of
Savoy arrived in this City aboard one of
ltis uncle's warships a young Italian
reached hare from Denver and put up at a
humble hotel at North Beach.
â  This was Pietro Gori, anarchist, a man
only a few years the Prince's senior, but
almost as known as Luigi of Savoy.
At. the time of President Carnot's death,
the European papers rang with the name
of Gori. He , had been the preceptor and
the familiar friend of Santo Caserio, the
assassin. , .
During the trial at Lyons the public
prosecutor opera stated that Santo was
but the tool of Gori, the brilliant young
Milanese lawyer and the most noted
anarchist in Italy. v
The prisoner at the bar denied in open
court that he was his friend's tool "Thou
sands attended his lectures in Milan," he
said. "How many of them have slain
presidents -after hearing him speak?"
Notwithstanding this denial of Carnot's
murderer, Gori was exiled from Switzer
land, after having been previously exiled
from Italy. He came to America and has
since devoted himself to making a propa
ganda of his anarchist belief.
Since the arrival of the Prince and the
anarchist in this City it has been noticed
by members of the Italian colony, and
also by some Americans interested in the
extremes of social beliefs which the two
young men represent, that when the
Prince appears in public the anarchist is
not far away.
On Saturday night Pietro Gori was at
the Italian ball in an immaculate dress
suit ; he, brushed elbows more than once
with the man who represents what to him
is a vicious and execrable^ power, the
power of royalty.
At the concert on Sunday at which
Luigi of Savoy was expected to appear,
Gori was there; he will be at the concert
to-night, where the Prince is expected.
"Why does the anarchist who excreates
royalty; dog the places where it can be
found?" This is a question that has been
asked several times during the last week.
The Prince goes about in a thor
oughly democratic way, without body
guard, except one or other of his fellow
officers.
Apparently he has no fear of anarch
ism, for at the hall on Saturday, when
Gori entered the room, he was at once in
formed of the fact by those about him.
"Show me the famous anarchist," he
said with unusual interest. When the
tall dark young Italian was pointed out to
him, the Prince watched him with a tinge
of well-bred curiosity.
! There was nothing but a kindly interest
in the attention which Luigi of Savoy be
stowed upon the anarchist. Apparently
he never for a moment thought of those
dark words of the Public Prosecutor at
Lyons when France was weeping for her
President.
Pietro Gori himself laughed lightly
when asked why he had come to a hall
where' he would be subjected to the in
dignity of meeting a Prince. "I came to
ccc the young ladies," he said. ' "As for
royalty, I pay no attention to it; but I am
dancing and enjoying the evening my own
way."
It was the same on Sunday. He went to
hear the music, .he said, ' but Gori is evi
dently not a stoic in things musical, for he
left as soon as the quintet began. He may
not have been able to endure the music.
It may have been that he found that the
Prince was . only represented by some of
his fellow-officers.
: Gori, when seen last night, willingly
gave an account of his connection with
Santo Caserio. "We were friends â¢ from
the time he was 18," he said, "and a more
honest, industrious young man I never
met. Yes, he killed Carnot, but they
goaded him to it with "persecution. Santo
trod the road of the cross in suffering, and
when he was maddened at last he struck."
By "they," Pietio Gori did not mean
Carnot and his myrmidons, but the
French and Italian Governments in gen
eral. He looks upon all government as an
organization created solely to sustain capi
talists in the possession of what they have
no right to; in fact, government to him is
another term for wholesale robbery, op
pression and extortion. "Santo was a
noble young man," continued the anarch
ist, impetuously. ?' . \
"He was a baker in Milan, earning his
bread. by the sweat of his brow. One day
they found him distributing manifestos
among the soldiers and led him off to
prison.
"Santo Caserio had not composed those
NEW TO-DAY.

manifestos; they were the . anonymous
proclamations of the anarchist party, and
what did they contain nothing * but j the
simplest principles of humanitarianism.
If your officers ordered you to lire on a
Ist of ' May riot, should you obey^ - if you
saw your father or brother in the crowd?
No ! the voice of nature forbids it."
--"It was for disseminating teachings such
as these that Santo was cast into prison ;
I was his lawyer and defended him both
at his first trial and before the Court of
Appeals. He was sentenced to eleven
months in prison, and when they let him
out after seven months, on ticket of leave,
I found out that they intended to force |
him to become a soldier, and intended to
put him in a regiment where he would be
subjected to military , punishment for
having made the anarchist propaganda.
"I advised him to escape abroad, and he
crossed the frontier and went to Lugano,
in Switzerland. The first., thing he did
there was to organize a strike among the
bakers, who were oppressed by their em
ployers, being forced to work all night.
The strikers triumphed under Santo's
leadership, but the employers boycotted
him and he was forced to withdraw to
Geneva..
"Ah !" exclaimed Signor Gcri, .inter
rupting himself to make a reflection, "the
word Mafia is that of t the employers. We
are cannibals in the present day, whatever
people may say to the contrary. We de
vour one another, with etiquette perhaps,
but none the less surely and Governments
make it possible, for they are always on
the side of the employers who devour and
against the poor, who are devoured.
"It was so with poor Santo; the police
hounded him. In Genoa he found work
and the officers said to his employers,
'This is a dangerous anarchist, do not
keep him,' and he was dismissed though
he was a faithful workman. He crossed
the frontier into France and found work
at Cette, and the Italian Consul told the
police to hound him as an anarchist.
"Our Italian Consuls are police agents. . I
said so to the face of our Consul in Lon
don. 7: '
"Denied work at Cette, Santo Caserio
went to Lyons, again found work and had
it taken from him at the instigation of the
police. â¢ I tell you he had a road of thorns
in tryine to keep body and soul together
and keep work in the face of his persecu
tors, but when his employers heard he was
a dangerous anarchist, they always let
him go. ,:,.-;>
"Santo returned to Cette to make one
more trial, for it was work or starvation.
He got a place and kept it nearly a week,
then his master told him to go. 'Why?'
he asked. 'The police advise it,' replied the
master-baker, and he paid Santo his
wages up to that day.
"People have talked of a plot ! If there
had been any plot - he would have nad
money; as it was, his wages bought him a
railway ticket to one station short of
Lyons; he had no money left, and walked
the rest of the distance. Maddened, pen
niless and hungry, he struck at what
seemed to him the type of the Govern
ment that had been persecuting him â the
President!"
"Poor Carnot," suggested a listener.
"As well say poor Valliant!" retorted
Pietro Gori. "Valliant threw a bomb
shell in the French Senate that could not
have killed any one because they were
going to frame stupid ferocious laws
against French anarchists.
"They killed him for it, but what was
his death but legalized lynching? The
present state of society is cannibalism,
and the generation that comes after us
will be more surprised at our stupidity
than at our wickedness in submitting to
such a state of things."
In speaking of Santo's death Pietro Gori
said reflectively: "When a man for no per
sonal interest plays with the guillotine,
one cannot resist feeling that he has the
strength of his principles. The middle and
upper classes judge anarchy by the acts of
certain individuals, but it is all a matter of
temperament. "*"â¢"',""â _
"Santo would strike at the despotism of
governments in, one way, I in another.
At the trial the Advocate Dubreuil said I
had been the preceptor, he the pupil, and
that being the . moral instigator I was
morally responsible.
"Santo rose in court and said: 'I forbid
you to attack my friend. Gori does not
instigate his followers to kill. Of all the
thousands that hear his lectures who but I
has killed a President?' "
Pietro Gori says his method is not to kill
rulers, but to convert the working people
to his belief in anarchy, then the revolu
tion will come, a revolution which will
bring about a union of laborers without
masters or rulers. -
"It is opportunity that makes the thief,"
he said, quoting a Tuscan peasant. "Some
times our. people have been goaded to mad
ness and" have had the opportunity, but
propaganda is a more effective arm against
capital than bombshells or knives." '
The lecture which Signor Gori gave a
few days ago in Apollo Hall charmed
nearly every one who heard it. Contrary
to expectations, the noted anarchist did
not preach red-handed anarchy, but the
broadest kind of humanitarianism. It is
stated that in his future lectures in this
City he will confine himself to the same
platform. He is also rehearsing a play,
"The First of May," which he has writ
ten himself as an object lesson in anarch
ism A of the milder type. In - fact, Gori
promises only to teach anarchism of the
â¢'grateful and comforting" variety in this
City. .He has many friends in the colony
who . scorn â  : the 'â â¢ imputation that his
visits to public places where the Prince is
to be seen spring from any ill feeling to
royalty. ; These gentlemen , say . he is a
great talker, but he has never injured a
creature "except with words. _
THE PROFIT GONE.
A. R. Gunnison Say* The Call" Has
Spoiled a Bunko Game.
A. R. Gunnison; the well-known fire
insurance- man, recently had a brief ex
perience with the young bunko man who
has'; for the past week been making so
much trouble for. George Camming Jr.
and other university graduates.
"The young fellow called at my house,
y32 Twinty-first street," said Mr. Gunni
! son, "and introduced himself as a nephew
of Rev. Dr. J- G. Fiske. . He said he had a
letter for my son. When I replied that
my.son was absent my visitor asked me to
i read the letter, and I did so. The letter
' purported to have been written by a friend
of my son who attended college with him,
and recommended the bearer very highly.
. "Then came an application for financial
assistance,' but - the whole ; matter â¢ had a
fishy look and I didn't respond. I sus
pected the young "* man on account of his
manner in approaching the -question of
monetary accommodation. It 7 had : too
much of the professional beat in it.
"After reading the account in The Call
of how Mr. Cumming and others had been
approached I compared '-' my son's letter
with tnese and found that they were all in
the same handwriting. 7< The youthful con
fidence operator seems to have worded his
letters * very â  much the % same, v the only
change being in the, name of his alleged
uncle. - Sometimes it is written Fisher and
sometimes Fiske. But - that * makes V, no
difference now, for I think The Call has
spoiled his little game." 7 -

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1896.
CARNIVAL OF HARMONY
|At the Second Piano Recital
of the Great Piano
j Virtuoso.
i
CROWDS GREET THE MAESTRO.
Two Original Compositions and Five
Chopin Numbers Were on the
Programme.
A crowded house, in which ladies
greatly preponderated; greeted Pader
ewski st yesterday, afternoon's concert.
The terrors of a citation to appear before
the tribunal of a" Justice of the Peace to
attest his representative's \ financial stand
ing did not seem to disturb the great
pianist's equanimity. He made his en
tries and his exits as though utterly ob
livious of things' mundane, and played
like one inspired. - A*.Ar>..
His first number was Beethoven's sonata
in F minor, Op. 57. The introduction
and andante gave the effect of a soft hu
man voice carrying the melody in sub
dued tones to a piano accompaniment.
The beauty of this portion of the work
was in part marred by an epidemic of
coughing which was most exasperating to
those who had come to hear something of
a higher order. . 7 'j'A'J.'Af,
During the variations and the brilliant
finale, however, the larynxes ceased from
troubling and the virtuoso retired amid
much applause.
Schumann's dreamy, dainty reverie.
"Les Papillons," Op. 2, with its heavenly
harmonies so strangely yet so beautifully
interwoven, was the next number and was
followed by Schubert and Liszt's serenade,
"Hark, Hark, the Lark." and "The Erl
king," the former of which was repeated
in response to an, insistent recall.
The contrast between the two selections
was vividly brought out and gave the dis
tinguished artist an opportunity to dis
play the marvelous facility with which he
can pass from one style of music to an
other of entirely different character, ren
dering each with equal perfection. As an
encore he played Schumann's "Nach
stueck" with an expression which could
be felt, but hardly expressed in words.
Four Chopin number were on the pro
gramme, but the audience called for more
and were rewarded by a most delightful
rendering of the "Pianissimo Prelude."
The Nocturne in D flat, Op. 27. No. 2,
the etudes in A flat, Op. 25, No. 1, and in
A minor, Op. 25, No. 11, were rendered as
they have never been before 'in the pres
ence of _ San ; Francisco audience, while
the Polonnaise in A flat, Op. 53, was simply
perfection in its way. The gem of the
Chonin selections was, however, the ma.
zourka in B flat-minor, Op. 24, No. 4. The
fire, passion and fury with which the in
imitable composition ; was rendered
brought forth a burst of rapturous ap
plause. ,
Two of Paderewski's own cpmpositions
were received with many manifestations
of delight. . His "Cracovienne Fantas
tique," Op. 14, No. 6, is a weird composi
tion, abounding in technical difficulties
and having an individuality which renders
it eminently unique. It was followed by a
dainty melody, also from his Op. 14,
which was " rendered y with a peculiar
tenderness that made it charming, though
far less pretentious in style than its pre
decessor.
Liszt's "Rhapsodic Hongroise No. 10," a
composition rarely attempted by pianists
on account of " its . exacting technical re
quirements, was next given with the ut
most ease and smoothness, after which
the recital closed with a brilliant- render
ing of Rubinstein's famous "Valse
Caprice."

TWO COWARDLY FOOTPADS

Night. .
They Rob and Threaten to Shoot Her

Mrs. O.J. Marble, who has a milk ranch
near : the Golden City House " on ] the San
Bruno road; had an "experience last night
with two footpads that will last her for a
lifetime.. â¢ 7.: '
She had been visiting friends in the City,
and was driving home in ' her buggy be
tween 8 , and* 9 .o'clock. ,As : she neared
Fifteen th avenue two ? young men stepped
in front of her horse - and â  ordered ; her ito
"pull up." Before she could do so one of
them seized the : ; horse " by. the ; bridle and
brought it up with' a sharp turn. V
The other stepped up to the now ' thor
oughly frightened woman, and, pointing a
revolver at '** her head * said: "Hand out all
the money you have in your pocket." She
nearly fainted when she saw.tne revolver,
.and â  implored ',*, the * footpad * not to â¢ shoot.
"Well, hurry up and give us your money,"

he said. She hastily banded , him . $25,
and in a trembling voice : assured him it
was all she had. .
"Now drive on," said the robber, "and if
you tell anybody about this we will find
means of shooting you."- The other rob
ber released his hold of the bridle, and she
drove on.
After the robbers had disappeared she
recovered from her scare, and drove back
until she met'a policeman and told : him
that she had been robbed, and then she
drove home. 'a â¢
She said that both footpads were young
men, but in the 'darkness she wad unable
to obtain anything like a good description
of them.
Both Captain Gillin and Lieutenant
Burke were asked last night if the two
footpads nad been arrested, but they pro
fessed utter ignorance of the affair. On
being pressed they would neither affirm
nor deny it. It was learned from another
source that men were specially detailed to
search for the footpads.
POLICEMEN AS CARPENTERS.
A Protest to the Supervisors/ Against
Their Being So Employed.
The Carpenters' unions of this City,
represented by their district council, have
decided to raise big protest against , the
employment of policemen as carpenters
in repairing the several police stations. ,
Ever since there has been a police force in
this City patrolmen have been taken off
their beats to repair lockers,* make and
mend benches and do other work for
which carpenters should be employed,- Of
late years one patrolman has been kept
constantly employed ' in* this manner, and
at times several have . been called off the
streets to manipulate the plane and ham
mer. Y.
At present besides the regular police
carpenter, George Russell, â  it is said that
several officers are carpentering, partic
ularly in fitting up the Harbor police sta
tion. Several of the members of the Dis
trict Council had their attention called to
this, and a committee was appointed to
look into tbe matter. Committeeman Mc-
Cartney called upon the Chief . and , the
Police Commissioners and -was informed
that the police stations are in constant
need of repairs. 7 However, they said. the
Supervisors f had never % appropriated any
money for the payment of a = regular car
penter, so the work had to sbe done by a
police officer. . 7.7
At the meeting last . evening the com
mittee was instructed ;to ; prepare and pre
sent to ttle Supervisors a petition that
sufficient money be set ; aside for the pay
ment of a ; journeyman carpenter to pre
form this kind '. of work in the police sta
tions. In the petition attention ; will -be
called to the fact that the City is none too
well patrolled by police and .even more
officers should be -appointed. Every
policeman â  should .be on z duty protecting
lives and property and not manipulating
a ]ackplane and hanging; doors. 7: Atten
tion is called to the fact that there are not
a few competent carpenters out vof work
who should have the opportunity of earn
ing a .living. 7 Carpenters will work for $8 a
?_ yÂ° r * 90a month.,; .The same work cost
the City over $102 a month when it is done
by a policeman. - y
Charged With Embezzlement. -
William Ogston, collector i for 'the * Co-opera
tive Publishing Company, was arrested yester
day on a, warrant charging ,: him with : felony
embezzlement. V The complaining -witness *is

COMPANY B WILL OBEY

Tenth . and Market Street Armory
Preferredâ The City Guard
Club.
The fact that the Nationals, Companies
C and G, are allowed to remain in their
building on Ellis street is the subject of
much discussion among National Guards
men who have been recently shifted from
one place to another,* many asking: â  "If
they move us, why don't they move C and
G?" The only answer they get to this
j question is: "They have too much pull."
Rumors to the effect that in the event of
orders being issued from ' brigade head
quarters for Company B, City Guard, First
Regiment ', of Infantry, of this City, to
move their headquarters â¢ from their pres
ent location at Tenth and Market streets
they would not be obeyed are erroneous.
Orders having been issued and the company
will move and will occupy the rooms ; for
merly used by the Signal Corps in the old
Second Regiment Armory at Page and
Gough streets. ' Vy7: : - 7 ;7
7The present quarters of the company are
among the most ; comfortable and luxuri
ous clubrooms in' the City, and the mem
bers regret exceedingly to leave them.
The only â¢ companies * now stationed at
the old First Regiment Armory, on Market
and i Tenth streets, are D, L and B, com
manded respectively by Captains Marshall,
Eggert and Filmer.
When Company B moved to Market and
Tenth streets, in 1888, the .sum of $2000
was contributed by members and ex-mem
bers to furnish ' the rooms. v.-.B Company
(the 4 old A City *â¢ Guard) - was organized { in
April, 1854, and ; many of the most promi
nent men of San Francisco have been iden
tified with .the 7 organization. The roll of
honorary member's embraces the names of
1200 citizens, many of whom are yet living
and still retain their friendship for the or
ganization. 'Among. National Guard offi
cers- who have commanded this company
may be . mentioned ' General "Walter Turn
bull, "General J. 11. Dickinson, Colonel
George W. Granniss, Colonel . Burdick,
Colonel Little and Major Cook. . 7 :;
â¢ "When " the members of the company as
certained that the ' edict had : gone â  forth
that they, should move to the Page-street
armory, and the Nationals ?be permitted
to remain on Ellis street, there was a feel
ing I that unjust discrimination --had been
made in favor of the "Nationals. Members
of Company B, however, resolved to obey
the I order with *"" their 1 usual activity, | but
they also decided to deed i all their prop
erty, except 'that belonging rto the State,
to the City Guard . Club.' > The > company
will therefore transfer jto Page V street * all
the arms, clothing, equipment and mu
