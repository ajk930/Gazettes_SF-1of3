SANTA MONICA
TO BE FAVORED.
Placed Under Continuous
Contract System With
San Pedro.
ENGINEERED BY FRYE.
Provisions Stricken Out in the
River and Harbor Bill
Are Restored.
THREE MILLIONS FOR THE WORK
California Congressmen Who Will
Continue to Fight Huntington on
the Floor of Both Houses,
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 23.â The
Santa Monica job has been put through
the Senate Committee on Commerce. The
matter came up for consideration at to
day's session of the committee, and by a
vote of 9to 6 it was agreed to put Santa
Monica and San Pedro both under the
"continuous contract" system; in other
words, the provisions which were stricken
out of the river and harbor bill in the
House Committee are restored. An ap
propriation of $100,000 is made for the
outer harbor at Santa Monica, to be im-
mediately available, and continuous con
tracts are authorized to complete improve
ments at Santa Monica constructed by
Southern Pacific engineers, which will
eventually cost $3,000,000. The . total
amount provided for (under continuous
contract) in the House bill for Santa
Monica was $2,800, but the Senate Com
mittee will even exceed this amount and
make the total reach something over three
millions. San Pedro is to get her appro
priation of $392,000,000 (under continuous
contract) as originally provided for in the
House bill.
There was a full attendance of commit
teemen present when this agreement was
reached. Those who were unalterably op
posed to the Santa Monica appropriation,
and who voted against it, were White of
California, Vest of Missouri, Berry of
Arkansas, Caffery of Louisiana, Nelson of
.Minnesota, and Pasco of Florida.:;, i. y
The meeting was a spirited one, and
those -opposed to the Santa Monica ap
propriation did not mince words in de
nouncing the job. The credit (or dis
credit) of the result belongs chiefly to
irrye of Maine -^Huntington's friend), who
is chairman of the committee, and who is
the author of a Pacific roads' refunding
bill, and Senator John P. Jones of Nevada,
also a member of j the committee, and who
(as is well known in California) has large
real property interests at Santa Monica.
Senators Frye and Jones have been work
ing unceasingly for Santa Monica for four
or five years, assisted by Huntington and
his railroad organized lobby in Washing
ton. â¢ *" : : '' . 'â AY't'A.'V"'^
- There was a merry time in the commit
tee to-day and Senator White and others
stated emphatically that they would use
their best efforts to defeat the appropria
tion on the Senate floor, while Berry of
Arkanasas and Vest of Missouri said that
there was no shadow of excuse for making
an appropriation that had not been asked
for by any one of California's Senators
and Representatives in Congress with pos
sibly the exception of Grove Johnson, and
which ha"d never received the sanction of
members of the War Department. They
quoted from the reports of three boards of
engineers in favor of the improvement of
San .Pedro's outer harbor as against that at
Santa Monica. Senator White give notice
that he would make a minority report,
and Berry of Arkansas intimated that he
would join his colleague. : if~j*Â£i *â "-â â¢ -
Frye, the chairman, when be saw that a
storm was gathering about his head sought
to temporize and said he did not want to
report the river and harbor bill to the Sen
ate if it could not be done unanimously.
White, Berry and Vest declared they
never would consent to agree to such a re
port. Chairman Frye then requested that
the matter go over until to-morrow, when
the committee could further consider the
Santa Monica appropriation. This was
the understanding when the committee
arose, but nevertheless, Senator White,
realizing that the committee's vote will
stand, is preparing his minority report,
which Senator Berry and probably others
will sign. White will make a vigorous on
slaught on the bill on the Senate floor and
will be supported by Berry, Vest, Nelson
Caffery and Pasco. If the Senate passes
this appropriation it will then go back to
the House for concurrence. If the House
concurs in this and other Senate amend
ments the matter will be ended, of course
but if the house non-concurs, a committee
of conference of three members will be ap
pointed to treat with three members from
the Senate.
The Senate conferees will certainly be
favorable to Santa Monica, and at least
two of the House conferees, viz.: Hooker
of New York, chairman of the Rivers and
Harbors Committee of the ' House, and
Catchings of Mississippi, will vote for [_,
So it will be seen that there is no chance of
securing a conference committee opposed
to it, and the only chance of defeating the
appropriation will be on > the floor of the
Senate or the House. Maguire. Bowers,
Barbam and possibly one other California
member will tight this item tooth and nail.
Maguire is now preparing his speech.
The attitude of McLachlan is in some
doubt. He declares emphatically that he
never asked for any appropriation for
Santa' Monica, but his position' is an un
fortunate one. If he opposes an appro
priation of $3,000,000 for his section he will
be condemned by Santa . Monica's ad
herents, while if he favors it he will be de
nounced by those who are opposed to the
machinations of Huntington. He is verily
between the devil and the deep sea.
His position will probably be a passive
one, feeling that he has already done his
duty by telling the Commerce Committee
lie desired no appropriation for Santa
Monica. McLachlan is naturally gratified
in ir,.. ii iTJiirnniiir TiTnniiiniinÂ«i Â°
The San Francisco Call.
that his appropriation ' for San Pedro is to
be restored, and would rather there would
be no formidable opposition to Santa
Monica, for fear of endangering and again
defeating San Pedro's inner-harbor im
provement.
The Los Angeles delegates who were
here to oppose Santa Monica's appropria
tion have left Washington, and only two
of the delegates who. came to favor Santa
Monica remain, ex-Senator Cole and John
W. Mitchell of Los Angeles. They are
elated over the success of their efforts, but
at the same time fearful that the vigorous
opposition of White and other Senators
will yet defeat them.
Senator Stephen B. Elkins of West Vir
ginia says he has experienced a change of
heart. At first he pretended to be against
Santa Monica and in favor of San Pedro,
but the truth is that Elkins is one of the
chief promoters of Santa Monica improve
ment, together with a syndicate of which
R. C. Kerens of Missouri is a member.
Elkins made a desperate attempt to be as
signed to the Commerce Committee.
"The redeeming feature of the Senate
committee's action is making an appro
priation of $75,000 for Oakland harbor to
be immediately available. The Secretary
of War is also authorized -to make con
tracts to completed work at a cost of over
$600,000. The Oakland harbor men wanted
$300,000 made immediately available, but
the assurance that the whole project is to
be completed will doubtless be hailed by
Oakland people with great'satisfaction.
WILL NOT SET A DAY.
Speaker Reed in No Hurry to
Act on Huntington's Fund
ing Bill.
Protests of Far Western Members of
Congress Were Not Made in
Vain.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 23.-THK
Call correspondent to-night received reli
able information to the effect that Speaker
Reed would not set a day for the consider
ation of the Pacific roads' funding * bill.
This agrees with what Representative
Loud of California said to The Call cor
respondent last week. Loud possibly
stands as close to Speaker Reed as any
Representative in Congress, and while he
could not state positively that Reed would
not set a day for consideration, he felt
quite sure he would not do so. The knowl
edge that Dingley of Maine, one of Reed's
lieutenants, is also opposed to taking up
the bill lends color to the probability of
the story The Call correspondent heard
to-night from a member of Congress who
says he knows whereof he speaks.
â¢ Of late various far Western members of
Congress have gone to Speaker Reed and
protested against the funding bill's con
sideration at . this session, arguing that it
would be disastrous from a political. point I
of view. ; .. I
Neither Representative Powers â¢_* Sen
ator Gear j has yet submitted his major-"
ity report, and Hubbard of Missouri will
not present his minority views until after
the former are submitted.
Hubbard said to The Call correspond
ent to-night that he thought there was no
chance whatever to pass the bill through
the House. He says he has been unable
to find almost any representatives (out
side of members on Pacific Roads Commit
tee) who are favor able to the bill.
SPEED OF THE MASSACHUSETTS.
During the Trial the New Battleship De
velops .59 of a Knot Beyond Con
-. tract Requirements.
BOSTON, Mass., April 23â battle
ship Massachusetts was given a prelimin
ary run by the builders over the official
course to-day. The trial was so satisfac
tory that only two-fifths of the distance
was steamed over. The ship was speeded
for a little less than two hours and in that
time she averaged 15.59 knots an hour,
which is .59 of a knot above her contract
speed. If the vessel carried out the ex
pectations raised by her performance to
day, she should make a full 16 knots on
her official trial Saturday, and earn her
builders a bonus of $100,000.
It was a perfect spring morning when
the Massachusetts headed down the bay
for the open sea, but there was a heavy
swell rolling in from the ocean. This
swell soon made itself apparent to those
aboard the ship. The Massachusetts
poked her nose into a roller and a small
sea broke over the bows. This was fol
lowed an instant afterward by a torrent of
white-crested, foaming water, which swept
several sailors along the deck like nine
pins, two of them receiving painful but
not serious injuries.
* After the Massachusetts got out to sea
the swell was not so heavy, but, neverthe
less, the surge was big enough to materi
ally reduce the speed of the - vessel.
Despite the heavy swell the Massachusetts
hardly rolled at sea, and proved that she
is an excellent gun platform. -'^'i-
CAPTAIN HEALY CONVICTED.
But There Are Extenuating Circumstances
' That Will. Probably Lighten His
A â ' Punishment.
WASHINGTON, AD. C, April 23â The
Call correspondent learned to-day with a
reasonable degree of certainty that Cap
tain Healy of the revenue cutter Bear has
been convicted of charges made against
him by brother officers, an account of
which was first published exclusively in
The Call on September 3 last. The testi
mony comprises 1800 written pages, and it
was a work of considerable magnitude for
Secretary Hamlin to review it, but the task
has been completed, and the facts are now
before Secretary Carlisle.
Although Captain Heal v will be con-
Victeo, his sentence is yet a matter for
consideration. It is urged in mitigation
that he has been a very able and valuable
officer and that his misconduct was caused
by liquor. It is also urged in extenuation
that he acquired the liquor habit in the
Arctic seas, where it was essential to
health and comfort to indulge moderately
in strong drink.

PROMISES IN A PROCLAMATION
But the Patriots Continue to Battle
and Capture an Important Town
Near Santa Clara.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 23.â Captain-
General Weyler to-night issued ; a procla
mation which he expects will result in
many of the rebels laying down their arms.
The proclamation says In substance that
the insurgents in the province of Pinar del
Rio have been demoralized by the obstacles
which prevent their passing the military
line from Mariel to Majanaand by their
constant persecution by the troops. 'â â '. :.i
It being known that many of the' insur
gents are desirous of surrendering, but
fear to do so believing that they will be
shot, he therefore orders that all the rebel
leaders and (heir followers who .during the
next twenty days shall present themselves
with their arms to the military authorities
in that province will be pardoned. \
Pardon will \ also be extended to /those
rebels and rebel sympathizers who sur
render - without arms. % The military
authorities, the proclamation adds, re
serve the right to : decide where those who
surrender shall reside. AA..',.\
.. Rebels have captured â ' Cruces, an im
portant town near Santa \ Clara. The
Spanish troops remained within the forts
about 'town, ; apparently afraid, to venture
forth to attempt to repulse the insurgents.
The latter, after entering the place, set
fire to the houses of several well-known
supporters of the Government. They
also looted a number of stores owned by
Spaniards, securing supplies of . provisions
and clothing." When the last advices were
received the rebels were still in possession
of the town.
Narciso Lopez, the rebel. leader who was
killed in a recent engagement : near Santa
Clara, was an American citizen. Com
plete details of * the engagement are with
held by the Government and this fact
leads to the belief that the Spaniards were
defeated.
Dr. Pina arid his wife were arrested a
few days ago at Santa Fe, province of
Pinar del Rio. They were brought to this
city and thrown into tho dungeons of
Moro Castle. The charge against them is
that they aided ' and abetted the rebels by
attending to sick and wounded insurgents,
Dr. Pina as , a physician and his wife as a
nurse. A.
Later news in regard to the engagement
near Juarco, Havana province, indicates
that the affair was similar to others in
which pacificos, or â¢peaceful citizens, have
been killed ; by ; Spanish troops. Fourteen
of the dead are said to have been employes^
on estates and ; riot* insurgents. ; On the
Spanish: side ';â¢ none were : killed and only
three , wounded, while! the Cuban dead
exceed thirty. Juarco is only fitteerilmilea
from Havana, on the Matanzas Railroad.
It was only a few miles from Juarco that
Dr. Deleado, an American; citizen,; was
shot down and left for dead and seven of
his farmhands massacred.

i HAVANA,, Cuba, April 22 (via Tampa,

would \ be possible, immediately after the
assembling of the new Cortes next month,
to implant in Cuba ", the | reforms which
were passed early in â  1895. , General Wey
ler replied that the, island must first be
pacified. That settled the , matter, for
while General Weyler remains Captain-
General his wishes will be paramount.
Here in Havana loyal Spaniards, who
taKe the pains to obtain other information
th an such as is given out by the Govern
ment as ''official news," and published by
the censorized local papers, admit
freely that they see nothing r ahead but
disaster. They have lost hope â¢ of Weyler
being able to crush the insurrection with
the forces at his command. They know
that .he is not gaining ground ; that the
heat in the interior now is interfering
with active operations arid that the rains
will be here in a few weeks. . ,
| Many, of the Spaniards who own sugar
estate's or other property which ,is being
ruined are wavering in their patriotism
now that their pocket-books are touched.
They 'preserve a -semblance of loyalty to
Spain in public, but in private they hope
something will happen to stop the wreck
ing of their fortunes, y ,; ',
. The situation from a military standpoint
is unchanged. ' General Weyler's troops
hold the trocha and Antonio Maceo is
encamped a few miles west of it, appar
ently in no hurry to cross it. The stories
of his being in a bad way for food and
clothes for his men, and the reports that
he Is ready to surrender or fly from the:
Island in a boat are absurdities. :It is
known by Spanish officers who have taken
part in recent operations against Maceo
that he has a I strong force of well-armed
men with him arid that the insurgents
have large quantities of provisions stored
in the hills. â  ::-,::' ;

FIRST THE LIE IS EXCHANGED.
Misunderstanding Over an Anony-
* â â â . : mous Letter the Cause of the,
â¢s.ii \ i , : .' Affair. -â -'â¢-?
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 23âRep
resentative , Hall (D.) of â¢.. Missouri and
Money (D. of Mississippi got into an alter
cation in the room of the House Commit
tee on Naval Affairs this morning. They
threw inkstands at each other. Money
was hit on the back of the head, sustain
ing an ugly gash from which the blood
flowed copiously, i He was removed to the
barber-shop and his wound dressed.
The encounter between the two Repre
sentatives is though to ibe the result of a
misunderstanding. There was an informal
discussion in the committee of a bill intro
duced several ' months ago } by Wilson of
New York which is designed to promote
the efficiency of the engineer corps of the
navy. ''/'.y\ _*â¢â¢â â¢ y .-: â â  -
j : Several days ago Wilson received an
anonymous letter severely criticizing the
' measure. He was busy at the time and
handed it to Hall, who is one of the sup
porters of > the i bill. In the conversation
this morning the . subject *of the : old con
test between the line and staff of the navy
was touched upon. Hall , spoke in this
connection of the anonymous circular and
said that people who would make the state
ments Â« contained in it were saying what
was not true. â¢' . f* ; y'*' ''?'â *-> â¢' .-â â â¢-â â 
;| Money, it should ; be explained, was ; - op
posed to the bill and construed Hall's ref
erence to the ? circular, as "â , being personally
applied *to him. He *is reported to ; have
exclaimed immediately, looking squarely
at 'Hall,- "You're a ' :^Aâ liar." ""'
Hall replied .that he allowed no man to
characterize him in ' that fashion and,
springing to his feet, started around the
committee table to meet Money, the latter
haying also started in Hall's direction. ".
â  A moment later Hall grabbed an ink
stand and < threw it ' with '*._ great violence
striking Money on the head above the left
eye. The latter fired , back an inkstand,
which' passed harmlessly over ; Hall's head
and barely escaped striking. Wilson.
* 1 At that ; moment CoaJey.' the messenger
of * the committee,; with - others who were
present, succeeded in parting the belliger
ent * Congressmen. Money was bleeding
profusely and was 'taken downstairs and
had his wound dressed. ,' : Hall remained in
the Naval Committee room for some time
arid a little later took his seat in the House.
. The topic most generally discussed in
the -hotels and ;â¢ other public;* resorts Zin
Washington to-night is the episode in the
House of : Representatives to-day. .As
neither of the gentlemen who engaged in
the altercation .will; make any statement,
nor has authorized any of 'his : friends
to do so, it is difficult to arrive at any posi
tive idea as to any further outcome of the
affair, though many members of Congress
and others \ friendly . to both gentlemen
have no hesitation whatever in declaring
the opinion that an adjustment of the
sudden and violently passionate encounter
between the two gentlemen will be made
honorably and satisfactorily to both.
The Missouri Congressman, in addition
to the fact that he is physically a much
stronger man than the Alississippian, is
also his junior by several years, and some
who j are very friendly to the gentleman
from Missouri are inclined to the opinion
that, though he is alleged to have had a
very strong incentive to his vigorous as
sault upon Senator-elect Money, his sense
ot his superiority in the respects men
tioned may induce him to cause repre
sentations to be made to that gentleman
in the nature of expressions of regret at
s his hasty and violent action.
Idle mention has been made in the dis
cussions and comments over the occur
rence as to a reference to the code in this
matter. This arises from the fact that
both gentlemen are representatives of a
section where differences of so serious a
character as the one that happened to-day
have been very commonly adjusted by re
sorting to thai method. Friends ;of both
scout all such insinuations, asserting that
the circumstance, while a most deplorable
one, and one that would naturally cause
much angry feeling on the part of both
actors, is one that can easily, as it should,
be settled by a mutual explanation. And
this the friends of both are anxious to have
made as early as possible.

English Statesmen Ask Questions About the
Venezuelan Dispute and the
Transvaal.
LONDON, Eng., April 23â In the House
of Commons to-day Mr. Labouchere asked
the Government a number of questions in
regard to the Venezuelan dispute as given
in these dispatches. In reply to these
questions Mr. Curzon, Under Secretary for
Foreign Affairs, said â¢ that negotiations
with the United States in regard to Ven
ezuela were still pending, but it was not
advisable at this time to make any state
ment on the subject. y.7?7

ernment expected a favorable result from
the negotiations.

Transvaal Government had placed strong
patrols upon the northwestern and west
ern boundaries of . the territory of the
South African Republic to prevent the in
troduction of the rinderpest into the coun
try.
â  He did not know, he said, how many
foreigners who had received a military
training had entered the Transvaal since
January 1.7 The right to allow German
immigrants to enter the Transvaal had
never been disputed.
Hon. W. H. F. Broderick, Parliamentary
Secretary for the War Office, states that it
was the intention ot the Government to
send from England further drafts of
mounted infantry to Natal. The items of
expense attending I these movements, he
said, would appear in the estimates.
J. H. Dalziel (Liberal) asked Mr. Cham

LOS ANGELES, Cal., April Straw
hats and overcoats form a rather grotesque
combination, and yet there are scores of
them among fiesta sightseers in this city.
The hat is the result of somewhat too pre
vious purchases out of regard to the posi
tion on the calendar of the month of April,
and the overcoat , remains in use as a re
minder that the royal chief weather clerk
is doing some, record breaking just now all
over California. .Every afternoon the cold
winds coming from old Neptune's home
are uncomfortably cool, hence the linger
ing overcoat . which should have been
closeted two months ago. This afternoon
was no exception. .
The great throng of people who rushed,
walked or rode on the single car line from
the business portion. of town to the Ath
letic Park experienced a brisk, cold breeze
for about three hours, but nothing daunted
remained on the grounds until a late hour.
It was fiesta games day in honor of the
Queen, who with her maids of honor
graciously attended. Her Majesty wore a
dress of while mousseline de soie over
white satin. Over this' fell yards and
yards of filmy Valenciennes lace.
A Spanish flounce finished the skirt,
which , was ornamented with garlands of
green and white tendrils and Nile-green
roses. A white hat, a white silk and lace
flounced parasol, long white gloves and
white satin slippers were part of this
costume. The Royal Lancers, mounted,
went to her Majesty's castle at '1:30 P.M.
and accompanied her to the park. *
| Thousands of people attended these
games, y Hundreds went to the grounds in
carriages.' *. Everywhere . about the park
were gayly decorated equipages. The great
grandstand was a mass of humanity, and
there, was not an inch of unoccupied space
upon the benches. Many of the spectators
were compelled to stand up for want of
benches.
Queen Mildred and her maids occupied
conspicuous seats and attracted much at
tention. The spectacle presented by the
great gathering of spectators in the grand
stand, on the bleachers and about the
grounds surpassed anything ever seen at
the Athletic Park. The maids were ail
tastefully attired, and everywhere were
the fiesta colors.
The tribe of Pueblo Indians from Isleta,
N. Mex., were there, and took conspicuous
part in the sport. Jose Torres of this band
of braves won in two footraces from about
a dozen of his own people, making 440
yards in 1 mm. and 5 sec, and in the one
eighth of a mile run he left his competitors
in a straggling string of from 100 to 300
yards to rearward.
The caballeros with their gay trappings
were again on hand, and entertained the
people in various feats of daring horse
manship. The foot and bicycle races oc
cupied most of the time on the field, but
were all amateur events. cln the 100-yard
dash Joe Ryan of the Los Angeles Athletic
Club won from Broughton of Santa Bar
bara and Howard of Los Angeles in 10 4-5.
Whitman won from Cromwell, Cowan and
Barnetc in the half-mile heat bicycle race
in 1:14 3-5. Stimson won in the second
heat half mile from Valiant and Bell in
10:112-5. r s?3%
In the 410-yard run Broughton of Santa
Barbara won from Morrill, Elliott. Ry a
Wilson and Howard in 55% seconds. In
the mile bicycle race, which was a very
pretty contest, Bell won '-. from Bennett,
Stimson, Valliant, Cromwell, Cowan and
Whitman. The latter met with an acci
dent and fell in this race, which fortu
nately did not result seriously. Bell's
time was 2:27 3-5. .
In the 880-} ard run Morrill won from
Golding, Birtch, Broughton, Hale and
Brossner. Time, 2:13 1-5.
The interest of the afternoon centered
in the â  competitive la fiesta drill by;com
panies of the Seventh Regiment, N. G. C.
Only two companies, B of San Diego . and
lof Pasadena, could muster a sufficient
number to take part. The judges for "this
contest were Captains Bougham of Pasa
dena, Dodge of San Diego and Walch of
Pomona. â¢ The award was made of the first
prize, an elegant blue silk banner, to
Company B of San Diego.
Then came the individual drill in com
petition for the la fiesta brigade medal.
Great interest was manifested by all the
officers and privates in th. field over this
contest, which began with about twenty
men. The judges were Captain Alphonse,
Lieutenant Redlands and Major Prescott
of San Diego. As the progressed the
men were dropped. by the system of ex
cluding those who failed in the order of
errors made. The elimination proceeded
amid low muttered disapproval and com
plaints by on-looking privates, but the
drill went on to the ? end, and William
Wheeler of Company B, San Diego, com
monly called "M urphy," won the ! coveted
brigade medal.
, ',' In announcing the decision and extend
ing congratulations to Private Wheeler
Colonel Berry said : that some of the sol
diers had teen let out not because of de
fect in the drill, but on account of careless
ness in dress und general defects in per
sonal appearance which might easily have
been remedied. Sergeant *_ H. Lavin of the
same company ha 3 won the medal once,
as has Corporal Granger. Both of ; these
forfeited ' the? medal ' by non-attendance at2
drills subsequent to' the winning, for it
should be understood that '-' the i holder
should win this medal three times in order
to retain it. """***â¢?â¢Â»* â¢â_ v . ?.'.**â * *H(;l
The drill of the Naval Reserves of San
Diego was a novel and interesting sign...
It was conducted in admirable style and
elicited tremendous applause from the great
throng of people.
Much disorder prevailed during the
afternoon owing largely to the lack of ac
commodations to seat the great mass of
humanity on the grounds. One reckless
caballero in making a mad dash for the
crowd of men and boys who were con
stantly encroaching on the parade grounds
and track rode against a boy and hurled
him violently to the earth. The foolhardy
equestrian was later arrested and .turned
over to an officer. An idea seemed to pre
vail at police headquarters that the fiesta
committeemen and managers 'should care
for the crowd, and they did strive heroic
ally to that end, but the throng was too
great. .'Ay A.
Unfortunately Governor Budd and his
wife were called away, but his staff re
mained. The departure of the hotel men
and some of the newspaper men from
Nevada made no apparent diminution in
the crowd. It was with the utmost reluct
ance that both parties left the city. The
hotel men would have remained, but they
were scheduled ior a banquet, and as the
arrangements could not . have been post
poned they were compelled to be recon
ciled to the situation. The eulogies of the
hotel men on Southern California were
very flattering indeed. The hotel men are
walking advertisements for California, and
it will be a big surprise if their visit does
not result in bringing big travel to this
State next winter. Most of the delegates
are wealthy, and they will point out to
their horn-? fellow-citizens the ineffable
attractions of this Golden West.
REAVTJLFVL ELOATS IS LISE.
Pretty Scene Presented by the Illuminated
".â¢?. Parade.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 23.â Red
lights glowed on the tail buildings in the
distance. The music of a band was heard.
Torches and then the music-makers came
around the corner. A troop of cavalry
and then the prancing vaqueros followed.
"That's a kicking lot of horses, sure,"
said a spectator.
A float on which all the colors of the
lights blazed in turn bore a representa
tion of the sun. That was "Persia" in
the illuminated march of tin nations. It
was a dazzling Persia. "Egypt" had the
Sphinx and less of a glare. Four horses
hauled each float and attendants bore
gasoline torches. "Assyria" was a glori
ous spectacle. There was a gilded temple
on wheels to lepresent "India."
The Queen of Sheba appeared before
Solomon in the Judea float. "Siam" had
a white elephant. Greece had a boat that
was literally afloat. Africa was repre
sented by a jungle scene. Ferdinand and
Isabella were the principal characters in the
Spanish wagon. Cuba followed, and three
beautiful girls of Spanish type attracted
more attention than the regal friends of
the man who discovered America. Florida
was represented by a semi-tropical scene,
and the float was declared to be the pret
tiest in the line.
The commercial travelers made a great
impression with their long coats, valises
and Japanese lanterns. The merry
maskers of trie Queen were next. More
floats appeared. Southern California had
huge poppies and a pretty girl. All the
floats of the "Wednesday parade were
also in the line. There j was a beautiful
representation of Kentucky.
The rest of the procession was made up
of business floats and the carriages con
taining officers and guests.
Queen Mildred watched the procession
from her throne adjoining the press gal
lery, and when the last float had passed
she and her radiant maids of honoi were
escorted to the Burbank Theater, where
a special carnival performance was given
in their honor. Wherever the procession
appeared the demonstration was terrific.
The streets were jammed and the tin
horns, tin whistles and other contrivances
made such an uproar that not even the
brass bands could be heard at some places.
CHICO' S MAY QUEEX.
Miss Clara Cussick Elected by a Flatter-
ing Majority.
CHICO, Cal., April 23.â Miss Clara Cus
sick is elected May Queen. Miss Clara
Cussick received ' 12,246 votes and Miss
Freida Junkans 8527.
The closing of the voting contest for May
Queen ended this evening, and all day it
has been decidedly spirited, thousands of
votes having been deposited for their
favorite. The selection of Miss Clara Cus
sick for May Queen met with general ap
proval. She is the only daughter of "B.
Cussick, who was the popular superinten
dent of tbe Sierra Lumber Company for
many years. Miss Cussick is tall, hand
some and very popular In Chico, and will
preside over the festival with grace and
dignity. She will have two maids of
honor who will be her support, and they
are the loveliest young ladies that can be
found in Butte County.
The report that was started to-day that
the A. P. A.'s were opposing Miss Cussick
caused her friends to rally to her support
and several thousand votes have been de
posited to her credit since. The ballot
boxes at the different places were crowded,
ladies rushing through the rain and mud
to vote for their favorites.
The Normal School delegation dropped
1000 votes for Miss Junkans, but Miss Cus
6ick's friends claim that she is so far ahead
that it is impossible to catch up with her.
Never before has Chico seen such an ex
citing contest.

NEWPORT, R. 1.. April 23â A1l day
yesterday a Government ? steam launch

prises a device by which ? auto-mobile tor
pedoes may be ? fired with A greater ?â  assur
ance of fulfilling their destructive missions
than the present intricate mechanism can
be expected to accomplish. -
The device is some sort of magnet, by
which the torpedo may be attracted to

range of effectiveness is claimed is not
known except to a few department offi
cials and the supporters of the inventor,
who is a prominent electrical expert. As
the matter is understood here, an entirely

Gruesome Testimony of Doctors
Regarding the Murder of
- Pearl Bryan. ! -
Strong Testimony Against the Men
Who Are Accused of the ?
Crime.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, April 23.â the
Jackson trial to-day. the defense began a
fight against the testimony of Mayor Cald
well of Cincinnati. The forenoon was con
sumed in expert testimony. Dr. Fishback
contradicted Dr. Jenkins on several tech
nical points regarding the coagulation of
blood. The two physicians, although dif
fering somewhat in technical points, are
agreed that Pearl Bryan was beheaded
while she was yet alive.
Dr. W. D. Littner of Leesborough, Ky.,
knew Scott Jackson for six months pre
vious to his arrest. He was present at a
conversation in the two prisoners' room,
between Jackson and Walling, about the
effects of cocaine This was about ten
days before the finding of the body.
Mrs. Bryan testified to the : fact that
Scott Jackson had been a frequent caller
at her home in Greencastle. She iden
tified the clothing on exhibition as that of
her daughter. , . Â£-.V{ ' .
3 Dr. G. I. Cullen said a head could be cut
off in thirty seconds.
Druggist H. C. Uhlan of Sixth street
said: "Scott Jackson came into my store
late in the morning of January 29. and
wanted a drachm of cocaine. I did not
have so much in the store, and told him
that if he would come back in an hour I
would have it. He returned, but found
that he had not enough money. He took
one-third of what 1 had, getting about
seventeen grains, and paying a quarter
for it."
Undertaker White says the body was
bloody when takeD to his establishment.
Fred Bryan, Pearl's brother, identified as
hi_ own the bloody valise in which the
bead is supposed to have been carried. .
Allen Johnson (colored) was then called.
He knew Jackson and Walling. Jackson
came to Wallingford's winerooms, which
are kept for women, with a young woman
on the night of January, 31. Jackson,
Walling and the girl left in a cab about
6:50 o'clock. He identified the hat and
dress of Pearl Bryan as those worn by the
girl that night. -: '^
On cross-examination the witness cre
ated a sensation by stating that Attorney
Sheppard of Hamilton had offered to give
him more money to stay away from the
trial than he would make by going.
At 5 p. m. the court adjourned with John
son still on the stand.
Women Xot Admitted,
BALTIMORE, Mo., April 23. âThe prop
osition to admit women as lay delegates
to the general conference of the Methodist
Episcopal church has been defeated by a
narrow margin. The vote of the. North
Dakota conference, just received, was the
last taken on the proposition. That vote
included, the vote is 7515 " for admission
of women and 2529 against. It is neces
sary for the ' proposition to get three
fourths of the members of the annual con
ference and two-thirds of the members of
the general conference. As the total vote
is 10,044, it is J necessary ,to have cast 7544
ballots to win. They lost by 29 votes.
Women : Outnumber the Men.
BOSTON, Mass., April 23.â The women
in Massachusetts outnumber the men
by 70,718, according to figures from the
State census, just/ made public. It is
thought that the Massachusetts maiden
ladies will,; when they see the census
totals, combine to utilize their leap-year
privileges. If they are enterprising and
the figures . don't frighten . the men into
flight it is believed before the end of the
year the parity between, the numbers of
unmarried of the two sexes will be less
than between gold and silver.! A'AA

It Is Argued That All the Nations of

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 23.â The
National Arbitiation Congress reassem
bled in Metzerott Hall this afternoon. A
paper by Professor John Bassett Moore of
Columbian University, ex- Assistant Secre
tary of State, on the advantages of a per
manent system of arbitration was read by
Professor Capen, Mr. Moore being unable
to attend.
President Morrill E. Gates, LL.D.,of Am
herst College discussed the principle of ar
bitration in its relation to principles of in
ternational law.
Rev. J. W. Bachman of Tennessee was
the next speaker. He said that the older
men present knew the misery that came
from war. Knowing what it meant, he
urged all to plead for universal peace.
Rev. E. V. Smalley, now of St. Paul, i
Minn., formerly a well known Washing- ;
ton newspaper correspondent, addressed
the convention. While he favored arbitra
tion he thought the United States should
first strive for the supremacy of the com- '
mercial world. "â !-?'â 
Carl Schurz, replying to Mr. Smalley,
said that if we were to become a sea power
we must maintain a navy equal to that of
Great Britain and France combined.
A. H. Love of Philadelphia contended
that the intention of the conference was to
consider the establishment of a great court
of arbitration and not the building of
navies. 3'y:3
General O. O. Howard was'introduced by
Chairman Edmunds as "a man of peace,
who knew something oi war." He favored
arbitration. The army any navy, how
ever, could not be abolished, but were
needed for use as a great National police
force. .;*â â â  ;' *'; '
Mr. Skinner of New York presented for

â¢ A recess was taken until 3 o'clock for the
report of the Committee on Resolutions.
Chairman Edmunds called the afternoon
session of the conference to order at 3
o'clock. The Committee on Resolutions
presented the following report as a substi
tute for the several propositions referred
to them :
This National conference of American citi
zens, assembled at Washington, April 22, 1890,
to promote international arbitration, pro-'
foundly convinced tbat experience has? shown
that war as a method of determining disputes
between nations is oppressive in its operation,
uncertain and unequal in its results, and pro
ductive of immense evils, and that the spirit
and humanity of the j age, as well as the pre
cepts of religion, require tbe adoption of every
practicable means of | the establishment of
reason and justice between- nations, and con
sidering that the people of the United States
and the people of Great Britain, bound to
gether by the ties of a common language and
literature, of like political and legal Institu
tions, and of j many mutual interests, and
animated by a spirit of devotion to law and
justice, have on many occasions, by recourse
to peaceful and friendly arbitration, mani
fested tneir just desire to substitute reason for
force in the settlement of their differences, and
to establish a reign of peace among nations;
that the common sense and enlightened pub
lic opinion of both nations is utterly averse to
any further war between them; tnat the same
good sense, re-enforced by common principles
of humanity, religion and justice, requires the
adoption of a permanent method for the peace
ful adjustment of international controversies,
which method' shall not only provide for the
uniform application of principles of law and
justice in the settlement of . their own differ
ences, but shall also, by its example and re
sults, promote the : peace and ,- progress of all
peoples, does hereby adopt the following reso
lutions: A
1. That in the judgment of this conference
religion, humanity and justice, as well as the
material interests of civilized society, demand
the immediate establishment between tbe
United States and Great Britain of a permanent
system of arbitration. ; â¢
. 2. That It is earnestly; recommended to our
Government as soon as it is assured of a corre
sponding disposition on the part of the British
Government to negotiate a treaty providing
for. the widest practicable application of â : the
method of arbitration to international contro
versies. 'â â >â -?.".,.'â 
? 3. That a committee of this conference be ap
pointed' to prepare and j present to the Presi
dent of the United States a memorial respect
fully urging tne taking of such steps on the
part of the United? States as will best conduce
to the end in view. .
Charles Dudley Warner opened the dis
cussion, supporting the resolutions, but at
the same time advocating * the mainten
ance of an efficient -navy. He believed [it
as necessary in the interests of commerce
to police the seas as it was to * police the ,
land. V; We were now in a way to say to
Great Britain that if she was ready to for
feit her place as a leader of civilization the
United States was not. ... ;
Hon. John L. M. Curry, ex-Minister to
Spain, expressed j his hearty approbation
of the resolutions.
Mr. Hundley of Alabama also indorsed
the* report, as did Henry Hitchcock of
Missouri. * -
During a protracted discussion that fol
lowed Senator Edmunds left the chair and
addressed the conference in favor of offer
ing arbitration to all civilized nations.
He contended that unless some expression
was adopted, looking to the recognizing of
other nations, it would be felt I that Eng
land and the United States were allies and
that other nations were excluded from the
alliance. . -.;*.
Mr. Edmunds suggested adding after
the words Great Britain, "and as far as
possible with other civilized nations."
Graham of Virginia proposed to modify
the amendment of Mr. Edmunds so as to
provide the opportunity of extending arbi
tration to all civilized nations at the earli
est possible day. \
Mr. Edmunds accepted the amendment
and it was adopted.
The appointment of a committee, con
sisting of Edmunds, Curry, Angel, Hub
bard and Hitchcock, to lay the resolutions
adopted before the President, ended the
business of the conference.
In the evening a mass-meeting was held
at Allen's house, and speeches in favor of
arbitration were delivered. It was in
tended to make strenuous efforts to secure
President Cleveland's presence at this
meeting, but his absence from the city
prevented this plan being carried out.

did not make the expected scene, but
walked firmly to the chair. At 11:42:20

Defeat of an Amendment Providing

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 23.â The
Indian appropriation bill carrying, with
amendments, about $9,100,000 was passed
by the Senate to-day after a long discus
sion about the lawless condition of affairs
in Indian Territory.
The sundry civil appropriation bill was
taken up and went over till to-morrow.
There are five other general appropriation
bills to be acted on by the Senateâ the
naval, the river and harbor, the District of
Columbia, the fortification and- the de
ficiency.
In the closing half-hour of to-day's ses
sion several public v building * bills were
passedâ ssoo,ooo for Salt Lake City; $188,
--000 for Ogden, Utah; $150,000 for Ports
mouth, Va., and $100,000 for Nashua, N. H.
Call of Florida gave notice that he would
ask consideration, probably to-morrow, of
the joint resolution heretofore introduced
by him requesting the President to send
war vessels to Cuba.
The Senate bill to authorize the con
struction of a bridge. across the Missouri
River at Booneville, Mo., was reported and
passed. . x . .
Unanimous consent was asked by Call
(D.) of Florida to have the joint resolu
tion, heretofore offered by him, requiring
the President to send ships of war to Cuba
for the protection of American citizens,
taken up for consideration and action, but
on the appeal of Piatt (R.) of Connecticut
not to press the request at this time and
not to interfere with the Indian appro
priation bill Call said he would withhold
his request for the present, but be gave
notice that as soon as the Indian appro
priation bill shall be disposed of he will
move to have his joint resolution taken up
and acted on. :y- : yAC
The Indian appropriation hill was taken
up. The question was on an amendment
of yesterday, by Piatt (R.) of Connecticut,
appropriating $50,000 for the Cherokee (the
Dawes) Commission, and instructing the
commission with reference to the breaking
up of the tribal relations of the Indians
and to the distribution ot their lands in
severalty. A point of order against the
.amendment as being general legislation on
an . appropriation bill was made and
argued by George (D.) of Mississippi.
After George nad spoken for an hour on
his point of order bis argument was criti
cized by Vest (D.) of Missouri, who said
that the Senate always finds what it does
not want to do to be "general legislation,"
and vice versa as to what it does want to
do. r Vest spoke of the Indians being ;
"allowed to constitute themselves as a
National nuisance," and he described
Indian Territory as "a pesthouse, legally
and morally, within the public domain,"
as being "a horbor of refuge for criminals,"
and as having caused a depreciation of
property in the adjoining States by a third.
The debate was continued at much
length. Jones (D.) of Arkansas denounced
the rule of crime and outrage in In
dian Territory, Bate (D.) of Tennessee
placing all the responsibility for that state
of things on the "bummers, land-grabbers
and thieves" who seek to rob the Indians,
and Piatt declared that more brutal and
savage conditions existed in Indian
Territory than in Russia, Armenia or
Cuba. Â~'>.*y
Finally the whole question was disposed
of by the Vice-President sustaining the
point of order and ruling Piatt's amend
ment out of order. The bill was then
passed and a conference with the House
was ordered.
The bill as passed by, the House carried
appropriations amounting to $8,420,445.
As reported by the Senate Committee on
Appropriations tk is amount was reduced
to $7,413,806â great item in this reduc
tion being one of $1,660,000 for "payment
on the Cherokee outlet purchase." This
item, however, was restored by the Senate.
The principal items of the increase were
appropriations of $500,000 for surveying
lauds in Indian Territory, $200,000 for
the support of industrial schools and $100,
--000 for school buildings and school sites.
The appropriations for the Indian service
for the current fiscal year were $8,762,751.
The bill for the next fiscal year, as it passed
the Senate to-day, appropriates over
$9,000,000. The sundry civil appropriation
bill was taken up and went over until
to-morrow.
Senate bill to provide for the disposal of
the abandoned Fort Shaw military reser
vation in Montana under the homestead
and mining laws was passed.
. After a short executive session, the
Senate, at 6 p.m., adjourned until to-mor

with which to procure lodging, I climbed
into the freight-car at "Waverly to sleep.
In the night I was locked in. '
"In the morning I tried to get ont, but
could not. Nobody seemed to hear my
knocks. I pounded on the door without
success. To make matters worse, I was
seized with a terrible rheumatism and
practically lost all use of my limbs. I was
soon unable to stand up any more and
sank to the floor helpless, worn out, tired
and hungry. I tried to attract some one,
but could not make noise enough. In dis
tress, I gave up, and with the rheumatism
almost killing me lay down to await the
end. The car was side-tracked and left
unopened. Last night it was hitched to a
train and brought to Jersey City. There
it was opened and I was found nearly
dead."

Debate on the Presidential
Preferences.
PLANKS IN THE PLATFOBM.

HARRISBURG, Pa., April 23.â The
Republican State Convention was called to
order in the opera-house at 10:30 o'clock
by Frank Willing Leach of Philadelphia,
chairman of the executive committee of
the State committee. Mr. Leach officiated
in the absence of Senator and State Chair
man Quay, who went to Washington this
morning. Ex-State Treasurer H. K. Boyer
of Philadelphia was chosen temporary
chairman. A reference in his speech to
Senator Quay as a Presidential candidate
evoked _ reat applause.
The Presidential electors as agreed upon
in the different Congressional districts
were then read and at 11:55 o'clock a
recess was taken until 1:30 p. m.
During the recess the committee on reso
lutions met in the Senate chamber. Con
gressman H. H. Bingham of Philadelphia,
chairman of the committee, presided.
The indorsement of the Presidential can
didacy of Senator Quay was opposed by
Chris Magee, Harry Hall and John
Golden of Pittsburg and Robert Brownley
of Lycoming. The indorsement was car
ried, however, by a large majority.
The convention reassembled at 2:05
o'clock. The report of the committee on
credentials was read. It seated the three
Quay delegates from the Eighth Legisla
tive District of Alleghany, as was decided
yesterday by the State committee.
The report of the committee on perma
nent organization named Auditor-General
Amos H. Mylin of Lancaster as permanent
chairman and recommended the continu-
ance of the temporary secretaries.
â¢ Mylin eulogized Quay as a Presidential
candidate, dwelt upon the issues set forth
in the platform and urged tbe young man to
apply himself and join in the fight for Re
publican success like a loyal crusader.
The report of the committee on resolu
tions was read by Congressman Bingham.
The platform declares for protection and
reciprocity; demands liberal pensions and
the enactment of laws restricting immi
gration. It presents the name of Senator
Quay as a candidate for the Presidential
nomination with the declaration that he
is "wise in council and brilliant and able
in action, at once the type of the Ameri
can citizen, scholar, soldier and states
man." . â¢ -~^?.'y
It declares, respecting the currency
question, that the Republican party of
Pennsylvania "favors international bi
metallism and until that can be established
upon a secure basis opposes the coinage of
silver, except upon Government account,
and demands the maintenance of the ex
isting gold standard of value."
The committee on resolutions having
defeated a resolution which recommended
that the voters express their choice for
United States Senator at primary elec
tions District Attorney Schaefer of Dela
ware County offered an amendment to this
effect. The amendment was defeated
72 ayes, 186 noes.
Congressman Robinson again offered as
an amendment the resolution declaring
for McKinley as second choice for the
Presidency, which the committee on
resolutions refused to adopt. This
caused an uproar, which continued for
some minutes.
Robinson made a stirring address in
which he declared himself as being for
Quay first and McKinley second.
Senator Penrose followed in a rousing
speech in which he denounced any effort
to belittle the candidacy of Quay.
The scene was one of great disorder, and
in the tumult Congressmen Robinson and
Bingham, the latter being for Quay, con
ducted a lively personal debate. The vote
on the McKinley amendment was 65 ayes,
178 noes.
The platform as read was then adopted
and the nomination of two candidates for
Congressmen-at-large was ordered. Isa
dor Sobel of Erie nominated Samuel A.
Davenport of Erie. Delegate Robinson of
Allegheny nominated William E. Harri
son of McKeesport for Con-Â»ressman-at
large, but afterward withdrew the nomi
nation and Messrs. Davenport and Grow,
the latter being the incumbent, were
nominated by acclamation.
Senator Quay was re-elected chairman
of the State Republican Committee and at
6:15 o'clock the convention adjourned
sine die.

In the course of a speech, Hon. J. A.

Raising his voice to a high pitch, the
speaker said: "Hell is too good for that

MADERA'S EQUAL SUFFRAGISTS.
The Convention in Session There Meets
With Great Encouragement.
MADERA, Cal., April 23.â The Woman
Suffrage Convention which has been held
under the auspices of the " local Equal
Suffrage League here for the last two days
has met with success. The Rev. Anna
Shaw, assisted by Miss Elizabeth X. U
Yates of Maine and Harriet M. Mills of
Michigan, and the local business and pro
fessional women, have made tbe conven
tion worthy of commendation. The ses
sions have all been well attended and the
audiences are not lacking in enthusiasm,
and the advocates of "equality before the
law," or the adoption of the eleventh
amendment, are maKing converts among
the men with remarkable rapidity. The
suffragists started in with the California
campaign at San Diego, and propose to
canvass the entire State up to Yreka for
their cause and secure a majority of
signers of voters for the amendment,
which they hope to have passed at the
next election.

hibition State Convention met to-day for
the purpose of electing twenty-two dele
gates to the National Convention of the

ence and address of Samuel Dickie, the

LAWYER HOWE'S CASE
Efforts to Quash the Indictment
for Participating in Holmes'
Conspiracy.
Will Probably Escape Prosecution for
His Connection With an Insur-
ance Swindle.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., April 23.-Jeph
tha Howe, the St. Louis lawyer, who, with
H. H. Holmes, was indicted for conspiracy
at the time of the discovery of the fraud
against the Fidelity Mutual Life Associa
tion, is in town for the purpose of having
the indictment abandoned by the authori
ties. Howe arrived in Philadelphia almost
simultaneously with Mrs. Pietzel, for the
murder of whose husband Holmes is to
hang on May 7.
Mrs. Pietzel came to this city in answer
to a summons from her attorney. Howe
is the lawyer who was said to represent
Mrs. Pietzel at the time the $10,000 on
Pietzel's life was collscted. Since. the con
viction of Holmes there has been some
speculation as to what disposition would
be made of the Howe case. The lawyer
has been under $2000 bail. It is known
that he came here for the express purpose
of having the case against him dropped.
It is probable that his counsel will go into
court in a day or two and ask to have the
case nolle-prossed.
It is said that District Attorney Graham
is willing to compromise the case. H. H.
Holmes and Marion Hedgpeth are the two
principal witnesses in the case. As one is
to be hanged next month and the other is
serving, a twenty-five years' sentence for
train-robbery neither would make a good
witness.
Mrs. Pietzel came here in response to a
letter written by her attorney, Thomas A.
Fahy, who desires her presence in this city
during his efforts to bave the proper resti
tution made to his client.
"I wrote to Mrs. Pietzel," said Mr. Fahy,
"to come to Philadelphia. One of the
objects of having her in this city is to aid
in endeavoring to secure from Holmes as
much of the money that he took from Mrs. j
Pietzel on the bogus promissory note as \
we can get. Another reason was to re- !
cover from Lawyer Howe the money that
ho secured from her. Mrs. Pietzel will
remain in this city for a number of days,
during which we expect to have the matter
settled." .yy.
Coroner Hiram Castor of Indianapolis,
who was sent for, will start for this city on
Saturday and will visit Holmes' attorney
on Monday. What bis trip means or
what connection it has with the case can
not be learned. ; ' A-j^'.'ry.-
SERIES OF BOLD THEFTS.
The Culprit Said to Be a Student of
* Columbia College.
NEW YORK, 111., April 23.-The stu
dents of Columbia College are much exer
cised about a series of thefts extending
over nearly four months. Early in Janu
ary members of the crew lost watches and
wallets and scarfpins from their lockers in
the gymnasium. After the crew had been
pretty well plucked the field of operations
was transferred to the Manhattan Athletic
Club; gymnasium, where the track team
trained until April 1. The mode of pro
cedure here was the same, except that as
many of the lockers had no keys the losses
were more frequent.
The students were inclined to make
light of their losses at first, but the thefts
continued with increasing frequency. So
far the guilt has not been placed on any
one. The attendants- at the gymnasium
are not suspected. j It is thought that the
thief or thieves p must be j of the student
body. At first there were rumors of a
kleptomaniac, but these are discredited by
the system and continuance of the work.
The college people have made every en
deavor to keep the facts quiet. It is said
that detectives have been employed. The
students are indignant at the thought that
one of their number should bo guilty of
such conduct, and are anxious to have the
identity of the thief discovered. â¢?*.? The value
of the articles so far * stolen will probably
not fail far short of $500. .

STORY OF CRIME
FROM SEATTLE.

Killed the Man to Prevent His Peach-
Finally Cheated the Gal
lows Himself.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 23.â James E.
AUbop, arrested in this city Thursday aft
ernoon, April 16, by Detective John Court
ney of the Minneapolis Police Department
for the murder in August, 1894, of Miss
Lena Olson, and who committed suicide
by hanging while in the city jail, was not
only a murderer and possibly multi-mur
derer, as now seems certain, but he was a
bigamist as well.
There are rather than one two widows,
for Err ma Allsop of Salt Lake City, Utah,
claims to have been the arch-criminal's
wife. Unlike the Tacoma widow she was
not disposed to desert her erring husband
when in trouble, for Emma O. Allsop of
Salt Lake sent him money and messages
of love. while in jail in this city. They
were not, however, delivered, for the Salt
Lake Mrs. Allsop, upon learning from
newspaper dispatches on the morning of
the 18th of her husband's suicide, wired
the Postoffice authorities to return her let
ters, and the request was complied with.
She wrote Allsop, extending assistance,
upon learning of his arrestâ at least, after
having by wire been informed that the
party in .custody was the person - who
stopped at a certain lodging-house in this
cityâ a fact which discloses that Allsop
was keeping his Salt Lake wife pretty well
informed as to his movements, notwith
standing his attention to the Tacoma
wife.
Courtney left this city, and the police
are said to be of the same opinion, firmly
believing that Allsop had to do with the
murder in Seattle of Mrs. Charlotte Fet
ting, on the right of September 4, 1893,
and also the murder in Tacoma of her son
in-law, James King, who was shot and his
body thrown into the bay on the evening
of November 17, 1893. V- "
After gagging her, the murderer or mur
derers crushed Mrs. Fetting's skull in
with a stove-cover, her life having been
taken in much the same manner as that
of Miss Olson at Duluth. , She was a
woman 80 years of age, and the crime was
done for $800 in cash, that amount of
money having been taken from her trunk
after its com minion. y. "7 . . .;.â -, â â -
;, At this time James King, whom the best
criminal officers of Seattle and Tacoma say
was an accomplice, was at a theater with
Ernest Fetting, the old woman's .son.
They attended the place of amusementâ a
vaudeville affairâ at King's earnest solici
tation, and remained until after midnight.
It is dow known that ' King and Allsop
were bosom friends and that â¢ they played
cards together, almost nightly about this
time, ana that frequently William A. Wil
cox, who was thrice tried for the murder
of Mrs. Fetting. being convicted once and
finally securing his acquittal, was one
of the party.' llp^'?;?*!': '- : '-a'A.
Just four days after Wilcox's arrest, No
vember 23, 1893, Allsop made his appear
ance at tbe Minneapolis .boarding-house
where his valise, the telltale letters and
will were found. King was killed, the po
lice think, because he was about to turn
State's evidence, not having been given his
share of the money stolen from the Fet
ting house as the proceeds of the murder.
STANFORD IS REJOICING
Highly Elated Over the Outcome
of Their Ball Game With
Berkeley.
Prospects of the Cardinal Colors in
Future Eventsâ College Politics
at Fever Heat.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
23. â Stanford enthusiasts were greatly
elated over the results of the first baseball
game. Never before had a Stanford nine
left for a game with Berkeley leaving be
hind it a more uncertain feeling regarding
the outcome than did the team at its de
parture yesterday from the campus.
Pitcher â ; McLaine, on whom it was felt the
responsibility of victory or defeat most
heavily rested, was still suffering from a
sickness that had confined him to his bed
for several days preceding. Taylor, the
shortstop,' was also a sick man, practically
getting off a sick bed to play this first
game. '/,'.*
Berkeley had another advantage in
being, on her own ; grounds, with a large
majority of . the spectators in .? sympathy
with her players. Stanford further recog
nized that Berkeley had a far stronger
aggregation this season than she ever had
before. -, i. y
There was great rejoicing, therefore,
when the score ; was sent in and another
Stanford victory was chronicled. If noth
ing goes wrong Stanford should make a
still better showing ,in the next, match,
which takes place hereon Saturday, May 2.
The last work of the track men on the
path ' took place last % evening, notwith
standing the bad weather. Dole's heel -is
worrying the Stanford men 'considerably,
and it will be a very serious matter for the
cardinal prospects if his stone oruise does
not disappear before Saturday. ? Much was
expected of .' him yin the ; jumps ? and â  pole
vaults, bnt his usefulness = will', be greatly
lessened i by his recent misfortune. 0
Toombs did 220 yards in fast time last
evening, and will give his Berkeley op
ponent a hard fight for first in that event.
Jack '99 and Wilkinson are both? doing
good work in the mile walk;
â â â ? Captain Toombs : says .j that .if Berkeley
were no stronger than she was last season
Stanford's f chances i would be * good" for a
victory, but Berkeley has"? improved since
that time, and: while he looks ; for a close
contest he has scant hopes of winning and
believes that should Stanford! come within
eight or ten points of a" victory she should
not be at all disappointed. '?:â¢ It is a well
recognized fact that Berkeley has a long
lead in ,: building ;up her track athletics,
and while Stanford has shown" constant
improvement each year, she can hardly
expect to defeat Berkeley on r the ? track in
the fourth intercollegiate meet. -.
The intercollegiate debaters are mating
final preparations for the contest Saturday
evening' in Metropolitan Hall, San Fran
cisco. Ever. since A. M. Cathcart, )H. D.
Sheldon and J. M. Ross were selected as
Stanford's representatives for this event
they have been diligently working up
their arguments. The contest should be
highly interesting this ', year inasmuch as
it will be the fourth <le bale, of which
Stanford won the first two and Berkeley
the third. * . >-? * * - :â¢'â¢â¢> â¢ â¢ , ,
Politics are boiling here at present. â¢ All
nominations for student body offices were
made yesterday and candidates are more
numerous than ever. There are so many
men up for each position, and new ones
coming in every day, that it is impossible
to know what the outcome will be. Still
it is exciting enough to keep students busy
visiting or . dodging the candidates and
their friends. The greatest efforts are
being made for the presidency of the
student body and for the treasurership.
For the first Chris Henne '97, o'Neil.'97,
and Pomeroy '97, are all canvassing. For
the treasurership, which is a $450 position,
there is also a contest, Morrison '96,
Brown '96, and Story '96, being up. At
present the chances appear brightest for
the first mentioned of these men.
ELECTRIC DEAL AT STOCKTOX.
Talk of Consolidating Street Railroads
and Light . Companies. -
STOCKTON, Cal., April 23. â There is
talk of a deal between the street railroad
company and the Stockton Gas, Light and
Electric Company, contemplating the sale
of the road to the latter corporation.
Whether the sale will be effected or not is
unknown, but the' directors of the. gas
company have been considering the mat
ter, and ' the street railroad company has
offered the road at a certain figure. In
case the deal is effected the road will be
run in connection with the electric light
works, from which power is at present
bought by the railroad company.
It is said that there * is much discord
among the owners of the road, and that if
a company were to take hold of it who
would act unitedly it could be made a pay
ing property.
The directors of the gas and electric
company who are considering the pur
chase of the road are : F. A. Hihn of Santa
Cruz, .Oliver Eldridge and William J.
Dutton of San Franciaco. Yesterday they

EPWORTHS AT WOODLAND
Heaviest Rainfall of the Year
Fails to Dampen Their

Several Interesting Papers Read to
Packed Audiencesâ Progress
of the League.
"WOODLAND, Cal., April 23.âNotwith
standing the fact that to-day will chroni
cle the heaviest rainfall of the year it did
not deter an enthusiastic session of ; the
Epworth League Conference.
To-night the rain is falling in torrents,
but even that did not prevent the leaguers
and their friends from crowding the audi
torium of the Methodist church to stand
ing room. The addresses and response
indicated whole-hearted hospitality and
reciprocation. Many excellent suggestions
of mutual helpful work and co-operation
were given.
This morning's session was occupied in
hearing reports from all chapters of the
Epworth leagues in the State. The league
work is growing in chapters and numbers.
It is increasing in interest in every depart
ment of work; â  Its literary department is
receiving increasing attention, and most
of j the leagues are doing work in some
form, while many are taking up the estab
lished course of reading.
? The afternoon session was given to the
discussion of the junior work. Mrs. H. M.
McKnight of Oakland read a paper on
"The Duty of the Seniors to the Juniors."
Miss Mollie E. Lawrence of San Jose also
read a good paper on "Why Haven't We a
Junior League in Our Society?" These
papers were full of excellent thoughts,
and called out animated and â  interesting
discussions. Men and women preachers
and people, young and old, gave undivided
attention. The conference, by resolution,
asked that the papers be published for the
help of others who cannot be present.
; Bishop Wilson preached to-night to a
crowded house. His eloquent words were
listened to with marked attention and
made a profound impression upon his
auditors. He leaves Friday morning for
Nashville, Term.', to attend the annual

BULLETS FLYING
AT LOS ANGELES.
J. W. Pitroff Wounded by
His Wife's Alleged
Paramour.
A LITTLE GIRL ALSO HIT
The Woman Had Deserted Her
Husband and Followed a
Mere Boy.
RELATIONS PURELY PLATONIC.
Such Was the Evidence Elicited at the
Trial of the Couple for
Adultery.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., April 23.â W.
Pitroff was shot through the thigh and
his 12-year-old daughter in the shoulder
this evening by Charles S. M. Peyton, the
alleged paramour of Pitroff's wife. Mrs.'
Pitroff, who is a spiritualist medium, left
her husband's bed and board at San Ber
nardino nearly a year ago and came to Los
Angeles, where she set up housekeeping
with young , Peyton, who was one of her
disciples in the occult art. Pitroff followed
them and had the couple arrested for
adultery. They set up the defense that
their relations were purely platonic ' and
the complaint was dismissed on the
gounds of insufficiency of evidence. Pit
roff went armed and repeatedly threatened
to shoot Peyton if he caught him in com
pany with his wife. The tragedy was post
poned, however, by Mrs. Pitroff's depart
ure for San Diego, while Peyton remained
here.
This evening Pitroff, on hearing that
his wife had returned from San Diego,
went to a lodging-house on First street,
where she was staying, to see his little
girl. He found Peyton there with his
wife and child and proceeded to carry out
his long-standing threat. Drawing a re
volver, he fired three shots at Peyton, all
of which went wide of the mark. Peyton
meantime drew his gun and fired several
shots at Pitroff, one of which wounded
him in the thigh. During the melee a
spent ball struck Pitroff's little girl in the
shoulder, inflicting a painful but not dan
gerous wound. Pitroff walked to the Po
lice Receiving Hospital for surgical treat
ment. Peyton ran from the house and
has not yet been captured.

LATHROP LAXD SCHEME.
Farmer* Meet and Offer Inducement* to
Desirable Colonists.
LATHROP, Cal., April 23.â The farmers
here to-day held a second meeting .with
Rev. Mr. Harrison of Illinois and H. M.
Lichey of Colorado relative to co-opera
ing with them in bringing their people
(Progressive Dunkards) to this section to
engage in diversified farming. The follow
ing resolution was unanimously adopted:
Resolved, That it is the desire of this Farm
ers' Union to encourage immigration Into our
neighborhood and extend a cordial welcome
to all persons desiring to purchase land and
that every member of this union will use his
best endeavor to show said persons about our
neighborhood I that they may see the fruitful
ness of our soil, the perfection of our system
of irrigation, our public schools and churches,
the healthfulness of our climate and the socia
bility of the citizens of this district.
Terms for handling the land were agreed
upon and the probability is that all the
farmers will offer a part of their holdings
at a specially low price for a limited time
as an extra inducement to the first set
tlers.
Messrs. Harrison and Lichey have been
searching several months for the best
available soil for a. colony. They have
been very careful and thorough in their
investigation of the soil and - climate of
this section and they feel positive . that
they have found the place here that they
have been looking for.

A WAR OF WORDS
AT SANTA CRUZ
Bitter Feeling Engendered
Over Lyon Post's Sus
pension.
SOLDIERS' HOME AFFAIRS
Their Discussion Nearly Leads
to a Battle in the
Streets.
A RESOLUTION OF CONFIDENCE.
Speeches Are Made in the Evening
by General Walker and Susan
B. Anthony.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April 23â Lyon
Post took down the emblems from the
walls of its headquarters, folded its flags
and will return to Oakland on an early
train to-morrow morning. The G. A. R.
encampment this afternoon acted upon
the suspension of that post and refused to
recognize the delegates. The action has
caused a great deal of bitter feeling, and
came near resulting in a street fight be
tween George W. Hoguet of that post and
James Shepard, Pension Agent of Oak
land.
Shepard charged members of the post
with making false assertions against his
character and defied any one to prove any-
thing against him. He was standinz in
front of the post headquarters and address
ing directly Mr. Hoguet, who at first paid
little heed to the boisterous language.
Finally Shepard said angrily, "if you say
anything about my character that you
cannot prove I'll make you bite the dust,"
and with that he was urged away by a
comrade.
As he moved away rioguet said to him,
"That is all right, Shepard, or Hanley,
whichever your name may be." Shepard
made no response to this remark.
When asked by a Call reporter what he
meant by it, Hoguet said that Shepard
had come to Oakland under that name,
but that it was rumored in Oakland that
he bad lived in Los Angeles under the
name of Hanley. : : ;y > â ;
Hoguet was the first post commander of
Lyon Post and is a strong opponent to the
"Yountville Home management. He said
that if the post had been seated in the en
campment the delegates would have pre
sented some facts in regard to that man
agement which had not yet been told.
"The truth has not half been told," be
said, "and when we return and hold our
post meeting next Tuesday there may be
some action taken which will make pos
sible the expose of this whole rotten busi
ness. Why, the whisky tbat is sold at the
Yountville canteen nets a profit of 77 cents
on the dollar, and where that profit has
gone is not known. That is the sort of
thing to be investigated."
George A. Norton, present commander
of Lyon Post, felt very keenly the sum
mary action on the apology offered to the
encampment. He seemed more hurt than
angry.
â¢ "We did what we thought the proper
thing to do, and the encampment has seen
fit to reject us. No, I do not know what we
shall do when we get home, but we shall
go to-morrow. There is nothing to be
said now, so there is no use talking of the
matter."
Encampment Reporter Robinson of San
Francisco gave out for publication the fol
lowing resolution adopted in the encamp
ment this afternoon:
Resolved, That the Department Encampment
of the Department of California and Nevada,
In Its twenty-ninth annual encampment as
sembed, after having carefully looked into the
charges against the management of the
Veterans' Home at Yountville and Its board of
directors, being convinced that such charges
were utterly false and unfounded, expresses Its
unbounded confidence in the board of directors
of the Veterans' Home Association as well as
of the council of administration and the de
partment commander of the department of
California and Nevada; that such resolution
be published as part of the records of the en
campment and at once communicated to the
public press.
Mr. Robinson also gave out this record
of proceedings: "Lyon delegation was re
fused representation by the encampment,
after which the post delegation apologized
for its action. The apology not being
deemed sufficient to purge themselves was
on motion laid on the table. This action
caused Lyon Post to be excluded from
representation in the encampment."
The encampment adjourned without do
ing any further business, postponing the
election of officers until to-morrow.
Gen.ral I. N. Walker of Indianapolis,
National Commander of the ,G. A. R., ar
rived here to-day, accompanied by his
wife and H. S. Dietrich, chief of staff,
who is accompanied by > his wife and
daughter from Chicago. General Walker
addressed the encampment briefly and
spent a part of the afternoon with the
Sons of "Veterans, who met in business
session, but did not elect officers as ex
pected. The leading candidate for division
commander is C. C. Houck, a prominent
Santa Cruz attorney.
The Women's Relief Corps to-day elected
Laura J. Robinson of Lincoln Corps No. 3,
Ban Francisco Department, president;
Martha A. Chapin of John A. Logan Corps
No. 43, Los Angeles, senior vice-president ;
Sarah A. Tripp of Rawlins Corps No. 29,
Stockton, junior vice-president. The bal
ance of the officers will be elected to
morrow. ,-
The Ladies of the G. A. R. elected only
the department president, Belle Herr of
Sacramento. ' ''aA'-aA'..
A. hard rain ; has been falling nearly all
day, thus preventing the street parade that
was on the programme for this morning.
If the sun shines to-morrow the parade
will be made, but the indications to-night
are not favorable, as it is raining.
The meeting to-night at the Pavilion
was largely attended and was addressed
by General Walker, National commander,
and Susan B. Anthony.
After the introductory exercises were
dispensed with' General Walker took the
platform and amid applause said:
We need not any standing army in this conn
try.; The' standing army of America is to be
found in the schoolhouse, it is organized in
the homes and it is kept up by the integrity of
the masses. There are to-day many people
who have accomplished great deeds and are
now proud of what they have accomplished;
but none of them ever saw that patriotism that
flashed through tho whole country, through
the hearts of every citizen, all at one time like
an electric shock.-; I once heard at a school
house the children sing with their sweet voices,
"My Country, *Tis I of Thee," and I could ; not
help thinking that this song should always be
in the heart of every American citizen.
There is a man who is to America what Moses
was to the Jews, what Washington was to the
early period of American history; it is the
statesman | the liberator and the man Abraham
Lincoln. Walk along on the path of life, and
lucky is he ito whom at the proper time the
Supreme Commander says, "That was faith
fully and well done."
Amid rounds. of applause Miss Susan B.
Anthony was introduced. She : began by
saying: * "Some of you may wonder what
right I, a Quaker, have to stand before an.
audience of old soldiers. Let me tell you
that a Quaker can also fight."
Then she dwelt upon the fact that vari
ous members of, her family had partici
pated in the great war, and therefore she
well knew what true patriotism and love
for the country is. Gradually she ap
proached her favorite subject, which was
introduced like this: "Not only the men
went to battle to fight for the country.
The women took an active part in it. Ihe
only difference between the women who
sacrificed everything is that the men re
ceive a pension and the women do not."
After explaining the justice of the
placing of the ballot in the hands of the
women the speaker prayed that the old
soldiers present would use all their influ
ence in persuading all citizens to stamp a
cross after the amendment giving women
the privilege of voting.

THE OCTOPUS AT BTOCKTOX.
Suspected Southern Pacific Move to
Harass the . Valley Road.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 23.â There is a
movement on foot to secure the consent of
the property-owners in blocks G, L and P,
west of Center street, to bring suit against
the Valley Railway and the Alameda and
San Joaquin Railroad ! Company for dam
ages sustained by reason of the high em
bankments which have been' thrown up
directly in front of their lots.
Just who ; is behind this movement is
not definitely known, but there are rumors
about the street to the effect that the
Southern Pacific is back of the plan. This
belief has been caused by the efforts of the
law firm of j Dudley & Buck, who are the
leeal representatives of the Southern Pa
cific Company ; here, to get the property
owners to come to some sort of an agree
ment whereby they may be empowered to
bring such suit. â -../.'
On â¢ Monday representatives of Messrs.
Dudley. & Buck, according to g the state
ments made by property-owners on Harri
son street, visited them and asked them
to authorize such a suit, to be brought.
The stipulation was that the other owners
of property in the district affected would
join in the suit. No agreement has â  yet
been reached with the property-owners on
the blocks in question, and the efforts of
the representatives of the Southern Pacific
Company may not : result in . any action
being brought. '?,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 24, 1896.
ELECTION FRAUDS
AT SAUSALITO.
The Town Greatly Excited
Over the Result of
a Recount.
ONE BILLET FORFEITED
A. A. Lawrence Changes Places
With S. S. Fielder as
Treasurer.
A NUMBER OF STREET BRAWLS
i
Several Defeated Candidates Express
the Intention of Appealing to
the Courts.
SAUSALITO, Cal., April 23.â great
est fraud has been exposed by a recount of
the ballots, and as a result A. A. Lawrence
has taken S. S. Fiedler's position as
Treasurer. ' On the recount - Lawrence
gained 15 votes. On the original count
Fiedler had beaten him by a bare majority
of 3, the ballots being 156 to 153.
The respectable people of Sausalito are
demanding a new election, and J. Stritt
matter, a defeated candidate, claims to
have discovered where he was fraudulently
cheated out of enough votes to place him
5 ahead of L. G. Ambjornson, who was
elected Trustee, polling a vote of 140 to
Strittmatter's 113. .y
The evidences of fraud are so great that
open charges against certain . men con
nected with the count are being made.
Those who were appointed to take charge
of the counting of the ballots were Charles
Forrest and Manuel D. Avilla, inspectors
Jacob Schnell and William Richie, judges;
F.Fiedler and E. D. Sparrow, clerks I.
Thomas and H. Loeber, ballot-clerks.
All Sausalito is intensely excited and
talking about the matter. It is claimed
that after the ballots were counted they
were put in a drawer in one of the rooms
in the Town Hall and locked up for the
night. The next day the Town Clerk,
Charles Dexter, sealed the ballots.
The new Town Clerk, Joseph H. Pryor,
was seen to-day by a Call representative,
and said: "lam sorry this trouble has
come up, and it certainly looks as if fraud
bad been committed somewhere.
"I can say, though, that since the bal
lots came into my hands, two days ago,
they have not been out of my possession,
and no one could possibly have tampered
with them. Before 1 received them,
Charles Dexter, who was then Town
Clerk, had them in his possession for eight
days, and I am positive no one could have
tampered with them while they were un
der his charge." . .
Mr. Pryor would not give any opinion
as to how he thought the frauds could
have been done, but said that he hoped it
was a mistake made, while counting; the
ballots on , the night of election at the
Town Hall. ,"*',â * , \ .' * '
, The Town Trustees met last night and
the recount took place before them and
resulted in the exposing of the frauds that
had been perpetrated. Fiedler was com
pelled to give up the office of Treasurer to
Lawrence. A
A most exciting scene took place before
the ballots were opened. Clerk Pryor no
ticed that the seal on the envelope was
not as it should be, and stated that he did
not like to open the envelope. This an
gered one of Pryor'a bondsmen, who
jumped to his feet and withdrew his name
from the clerk's bonds. In an instant a
number of men were on their feet, stating
that they would go on Pryor's bond.
Joseph H. Pryor, the newly elected
clerk, is a journalist, aud one of the most
popular men in Sausalito.
There were a number of street brawls in
Sausalito last night that managed to in -
tensify the excitement.
One of the technical points upon which
the citizens hope to rely in order to have
the election set aside and a new one or
dered is the fact that the ballots were
marked with black ink, where the law re
quires that red ink should be used.
. While the point is an extremely delicate
one, it is hoped that it may be successfully
applied so that a new election may be ob
tained.
It is the general opinion that the frauds
were committed at the count, although the
ballots for one whole night were left in a
drawer unsealed in a building easy of
access.
When the count took place at Sausalito's
Town Hall on the night of April 13 it was
a noticeable fact that the table was so ar
ranged that no one could get in back of it
and look over the shoulders of the clerk
who read the Ballots or the men who
tallied. - '.
While the count went on the public in
attendance, and also the reporters, were
forced to stay in front of the table, the
empty booths being so arranged as to form
a barrier and | exclude the public from a
rear view. When the count had been com
pleted a Call reporter ? pushed a booth
aside and made his way. behind and was
told that no one was . allowed there. He
refused to leave and went .*' on with his
work of obtaining ; the result of the elec
tion and was not again molested.
: : There is little doubt but | that a number
of indictments will : be brought against
the officers who conducted the count, but
it is extremely doubtful whether the true
facts of how the vote became changed will
ever be known, from the fact that the
votes were left unsealed for one whole
night.;';: *-;ââ¢ \y-y'
A : number of defeated candidates have
'expressed the intention of applying to the
courts for relief, and trouble is expected.
The bad feeling existing. between john
E. Creed and "Alfred Brandes, who waged
a bitter fight for the Marshalship, is not
over, and a clash between the men is ex
pected to occur any day.
; The election, of Pryor to the clerkship
has left th c office '- of - Recorder or Town
Judge vacant, and three men are striving
" for the : positionâ A; ' Sylva/ an . attorney,
William Harrold, who was defeated" by
Pryor for * the â : clerkship, Â» and â¢-â  Eugene
Cramer, a Deputy Constable.
It is said that Sylva is in the lead for the
position; but the matter of appointment
rests in the hands of: the Town Trustees,
and they : have ? not ? given * the i matter I a
thought tas v yet, in view, of the i unsettled
condition 'of public 'â¢ affairs ?in ? the ? little
town : on ? the { southern /.border * of : Marin
County. , , Â. . .
FIGHT AT SAUBALITO.
Dr. Freeman I* Unmercifully Beaten by
*.y, .an Expressman. .
â¢':. SAUSALITO, Cau, April 23.â Dr. Rich
ard T. Freeman was beaten unmercifully
by George Smith, an expressman, last
night. Freeman 1 has figured in a number
of sensational matters in Sausalito before,
and the news of his reception at the hands
of Smith will create no surprise.
... It seems that Smith had a bundle to deliv
er to the doctor and carted it to the house,
where he left? it. He went to the doctor
last night to get' paid for delivering the
package, but for some ; reason the ? doctor
would not pay him. : This angered Smith,
who attempted to take the package ] back,
saying that if he was not paid for deliver
ing it he would take it to where he brought
it from.
Dr. Freeman would not give ?it up nor
pay for its delivery, so Smith proceeded to
get some satisfaction and started in to
give the doctor a* beating, and he suc
ceeded Better than he expected.;
The doctor proved to be a baby in his
hands, and with a right good will the ex-
Eressman practiced all the fancy punches
c had read about in the sporting papers.
The doctor at last got away pretty much
the worse for wear and swore ! out a war
rant for Smith's arrest. Creed arrested
Smith and the matter went over until next
Monday.
Freeman is an adept at rows in Sausalito,
having about three months ago got into
difficulty with Dr. G. Childs Macdonald,
who gave him a beating, and was fined $20
for the same. ;
Things were made so unpleasant for
Macdonald that he left town shortly after
ward. , :. r >-_;:
| About this time Freeman's license to
practice medicine was revoked by the
State Board of Medical Examiners, it
being shown that he left England on ac
count of serious difficulty. Freeman left
Sausalito for a week, when he came back
and went on ; practicing again, ana as no
effort was made to prevent him from so
doing, he Is still doing business.
The charges in England were serious, he
being accused of causing the death of a
young girl named Matilda Franklin by a
criminal operation. He came to Califor
nia and settled in Sausalito, where every
few months he gets into some trouble.
Dr. Crumpton once kicked him on the
streets j of Sausalito. and numerous other
incidents are recalled by the people of Sau
salito.

SAN . JOSE, Cal., April 23.â Emma
Hawkins, a woman of the town, was found
murdered this afternoon in her room in
the | Hensley House. She was last seen
alive Wednesday afternoon about 1
o'clock, when Mrs. Kate Daroy, the land
lady, took her some linen for her bed. The
woman was in the best of spirits. When
the landlady left a man, who looked like a
Portuguese, was seen to enter the room.
This afternoon at 3 o'clock Mrs. Darcy
went to the room to collect her rent and
was unable to get a reply.
Thinking the woman was sick or had a
fit, which she was subject to, she went
through another room and entered Emma's
apartment by a connecting door. She was
horrified to find the woman lying dead in
a pool of blood. i y?y?y ?â¢ CA
. She notified the police, ana Chief Kid
ward and several officers were soon on the
scene. When they . arrived an investiga
tion was commenced. Only the back of
the head and feet of the murdered woman
could be seen. Piled upon her body were
her clothes and the bedclothes.
These were removed and it was seen that
her throat had been cut. There were
three other cuts on the left side of her
faceâ one above; the eye, one beneath and
one the eyelid. They were no other marks
of violence. The jugular vein of an artery
was severed.
The room was in confusion. Her trunks
had been ransacked, bureau-drawers rifled
and their contents strewn about the room.
Five gold rings which the woman wore
had been taken from her fingers. What
the motive for the crime was is not known,
for she had no money and owed for the
rent of her room.
Soon after the discovery was made Geor
gia Chase, another inmate of the house,
was taken into custody on suspicion of
having had something to do with the mur
der. She and - the Hawkins woman had
been friends, but Wednesday afternoon
the Chase woman' . tried to kill j herself by
taking carbolic acid, and it was thought
to-day that she had killed the other woman
and then tried to kill herself. She will tbe
held pending an investigation. * .
During ' the .' investigation a bedspread
was found which contained blood marks,
and also the imprint of a shoe which had
been bloody. No knife was found in the
room, but under a sofa a washbasin partly
filled with water colored with blood was
found, showing that the ' murder had
washed- his hands after committing the
awful deed. He left the room by the door
he entered, shutting it, and it was fastened
with a spring lock.
' The woman was attired in her night
clothes and the struggle that took place
was undoubtedly brief for no one in the
house heard it and there were other
lodgers near by at the time.
August Bourgonen, a Santa Clara baker,
a former companion of the woman, was
taken into custody, but he gave a good ac
count of himself and was released. The
police are following every clew but have
been unable to accomplish much. An in
quest will be held to-morrow. .

THE CHICAGO MEETING.
An Agreement to Postpone Indefinitely
the Advance in Rates.
CHICAGO, Cal., April There was a
brief but important meeting of the execu
tive committee of the new Transconti
nental Freight Association at the Audito
rium Hotel to-day, the result being of
vital ; interest /to every shipper on the
Pacific Coast and in contiguous territory.
At the Milwaukee meeting the? roads
agreed to advance rates to a profitable
basis after the Panama railroad war had
forced them to do business at a loss since
1893. â¢; No date was fixed for the new
schedule to be put into effect, advancing
rates about 25 per cent, and the executive
committee met to-day to pass on that
momentous question. There was only a
unanimous agreement to postpone indefi
nitely any advance in rates.
There had been mutterings of dissension
for a week, and the trouble is deep-seated,
because the officials will not speak of it.
Third Vice-President Morton, who repre
sented the Santa Fe at the meeting, said:
"There will be no change in' the rates.
The trouble is a matter of domestic con
cern which does not interest the public I
thought the association was going to have
smooth sailing, but this does not look
like it."
The rupture practically brings all the
work of organizing a new association to
naught, as the prime object was to advance
rates. AA^aaA' : AAA.
The trans-Missouri committee of the
Western Passenger Association labored
to-day with the party-rate problem and
adjourned till to-morrow without reaching
an agreement. The general managers of
Western lines also did not conclude their
mileage-ticket details, appointing a com
mittee to report next week.

One of Dr. Pierces Pleasant Pellets
would start the poisonous matter in the

cathartic dose.
Dr. Pierces Pleasant Pellets never
gripe and they cure tennanentlv. You
needn't take them forever â just long
enough to regulate the bowels â then
stop. In this way you don't become' a
slave to their use as with other pills.
Once used,, they are always in favor.
Some designing dealers do not permit
their customers to have Dr. Pierces Pel-

profits. Such dealers are short-sighted.

TO SAN DIEGO.
A Guarantee Fund for the
Southern Pacific Being
Raised.
COMPETITION IS DESIRED
Mayor Carlson Talks Interest
ingly and Eloquently of His
Hobby.
HIS POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS.
Says He Is in Favor of Protection,
Appropriations and Patronage
for Friends.
Mayor W. H. Carlson of San Diego is
among the distinguished men from the
southern part of the State who accom
panied the visiting hotel men from that
section to this City yesterday.
Aside from his political aspirations,
Mayor Carlson has a hobby, and that is to
see San Diego enjoying the benefits of rail
road competition, and considerable of his
energy is being continually utilized to
bring about this object.
Just now he is busily engaged in pre
paring for the approaching campaign,
when he will make a fight for Congres
sional honors in the Seventh District.
The Republican nomination is said to lie
between him and Congressman Bowers,
and Mayor Carlson is far from sanguine of
defeating the incumbent for the honor.
â¢ lie is prepared, however, he says, to
take the field as an independent candidate
with Republican leanings. He feels con
fident of election, as he has twice before
won political honors as an independent
candidate, once as an Assemblymen and
again as Mayor. He cites the record of
Bowers during his three terms in Congress
as being far from favorable to that gentle
man. Speaking of this, Mayor Carlson
yesterday said:
"Why, what has he done either for his
constituents or his friends? He has failed,
during his entire three terms, in getting a
single appropriation for our part of the
State, and has also failed to secure any de
sirable patronage for his friends. And I
propose to go into the campaign against
him for these reasons. Should I be re
turned I feel confident that I shall be abie
to show a better record in one term than
he has in three on these points.
"Some mistaken impression has gone
out that I am a Populist. Now, that is
not so, for I am a thorough Republican,
and am a firm believer in protection and
particularly in a high tariff to protect the
fruit-growing interests of California against
foreign competition. I am also, you can
say, strongly in favor of Federal appro
priations for my district."
Then branching off to his railroad hobby,
the handsome Mayor from the sunny
south said:
"Production in and about San Diego
County, has so largely increased during
the past few years that I am of the opinion
that in the next two years we shall be
shipping oranges, lemons, limes and other
fruits at the rate of 4000 carloads per
annum out of the county.
"San Diego is now the only one of the
leading cities of California that the South
ern Pacific Company does not reach, and
with the revival of 'business from the de
pression which began about three years
ago San Diego is now in a position to re
quest the Southern Pacific Company to
build to our city.
"At the present moment the Southern
Pacific Company has just completed a
branch line into Riverside, and they have
also built from San Dimas to Pomona,
from which :atter point connection will
be made with the branch to Riverside,
making a sort of loop line coming into the
Santa Fe's present rich and exclusive
orange-growing section.
"When the work is complete I have
every reason to believe that the Southern
Pacific Company can be induced to build
into San Diego, if the people there will
offer the proper inducements, which I
know they will."
"At a meeting held a month and a half
ago some of the most prominent, influen
tial and wealthy citizens indorsed a propo
sition to raise a guarantee fund of $480,000
in real estate, the deeds to be placed in
escrow, as a guarantee to the Southern Pa
cific Company of 4 per cent per annum on
$4,000,000, the estimated cost of building
the line into San Diego. This would give
a guarantee for three years at the rate of
$160,000.
"At this meeting a sub-committee was
appointed to raise this guarantee fund
consisting of ex-Mayor. Sherman, Alder
man Prout, State Harbor Commissioner
D. C. Reed and Henry Tinker, a million
aire of St. Louis, and one of the leading
property-owners of San Diego. They are
now actively at work on the matter, and
I expect they will shortly be in a position
to lay the matter before the proper South
ern Pacific authorities.
"I am in favor of and have been work
for 4 several years past to secure the en
trance of the Southern Pacific Company
into San Diego, as I consider that in com
petition lies the only means of settling the
present railroad questionâ that is, I am a
believer in settling the matters of fares
and freights by the means of competition,
the same as are prices in all classes of
business, and not by hostile legislation
nor prejudiced attacks.*
"I am in favor of more railroads, as
through tneir building is brought about
more competition, more traffic, lower rates
and greater prosperity for all of California.
Take the construction of the San Joaquin
Valley road. Its competition will not be
so much an injury to the Southern Pacific
Company as it will be a means of more
thoroughly Developing the section of
country through which it will operate. It
will of course Dring rates down, but this
will again undoubtedly result in a greater
incentive to production and to a greater
volume of traffic" ,
When the plans of the people of San
Diego were called to the attention of Gen
eral Manager Kruttschnitt of the Southern
Pacific Company he said? he, had never
heard of them before, and that no propo
sition had as yet been laid before him. and
that consequently the matter of building
to San Dieuo had never been considered.
Further than this he declined to say on
the subject at the present time.

sentence, adding, "But mind, you must
not send me that gamecock." Tenterden,
on the other hand, strongly discounten

ARGUED IX THE REICHSTAG.
Count Herbert Bismarck Opposes a Gov-

BERLIN, Germany, April 23.â 1n the
Reichstag to-day Count Herbert Bismarck
made a speech in opposition to the pro
posal of the Government to limit the num
ber of working hours in the various
industries upon the ground that such com
pulsory limitation would unsettle trade.
No Government, he declared, had done
what Germany had done for the welfare of
the working classes within the last fifteen
years.
Freiherr yon Berlepsch, Minister of
Commerce refuted. Count Bismarck's at
tacks upon the Government policy. As
long as he remained a Minister, he de
clared, he would strive to the utmost to se
cure laws for the protection of the work
ing people and see they did not remain. a
dead letter. Furthermore, he would con
tinue his endeavors to amend such laws
wherever defects in them were discovered.
CBOOKE'S TUBE FOR GOLD
Practical Use to Be Made of a
New and Mysterious
Ray.
Discoverers Claim to Be Able to Manu
facture the Metal for Thirteen
Cents a Pound.
DES MOINES. lowa, April 23.â When it
was announced a few days ago that George
Lawrence Johnson, a farmer, living near
Fairfield, had discovered â  a process - allied
to the - - X-rays, and which he termed
Y-rays, by means of which a base metal
could be transmuted into gold at small
cost, people treated the matter as a joke.
Investigation by a correspondent at .Fair
field, who has induced Johnson to talk
about his discovery, puts a different light
on the matter. It is found that Johnson
is a graduate of Columbia College, New
York, well provided for financially and
possessing a complete laboratory. â -v < ;
After the publication of Professor Roent
gen's discoveries Johnson 1 became inter
ested, and in company with a Mr. Minear
duplicated some of the easier experiments.
After securing j several pictures they con
cluded to experiment on the; comparative
transparency of several metals ;to the X
rays. By accident f a block of one of the
most common metals was placed in the
box in a certain relation to the anode pole
of the Crooke's tube. AaA
After two hours Mr. Johnson observed
that this metal was undergoing a change.
The surface nearest, the tube was covered
to a depth of one-fourth of an inch with a
white powder. Beneath this the /metal
presented uneven surfaces of yellowish
color. More metal was procured and a
like resuit followed./ - The change t must
have resulted from its proximity to the
anode pol* of the Crooke's tube. Rays of
great chemical : power must have been
thrown off, and Mr. Johnson called these
Y-rays. â¢ ......
Mr. Johnson sent a block of the metal to
a friend at' Columbia College, John C.
. Hotchkiss, asking him to ; determine ; its
nature. * A reply has been i received, in
which preliminary results were . given.
The yellow metal, Mr. Hotchkiss says, "is
probably gold." A.yyyy : : . -..' ..â 
The base metal used is a secret. Accord
ing to Mr. Johnson it is 68.92 percent gold,
and ': he can . decompose a pound in three
hours at an expense of 13>_ cents per pound.
This means at a cost of about 50 cents to
produce about $153 worth of gold. : Steps
have been taken to 'â  patent the process in
this country arid abroad. AyA'A â

PASSING OF THE CABLE
An Eastern Railway Journal
Says It Is Doomed in
San Francisco.
ELECTKICITY TO THE FORE.
May Soon Be in Effective Operation
on All the City Railway
Lines. â¢
A recent number of the Street Railway
Journal of New YorK, unaer 'the head of
"The Doom of the Cable in San Fran
cisco," has some interesting things to say
concerning the development of the electric
street railway in" San Francisco and the
possible supplanting of the cable by elec
tricity throughout : the â  entire Market
street system, and, indeed, the whole City.
In the Hobart building the Journal's de
ductions were not accepted. ."The Mar
ket-street Railway .Company," say the au
thorities, "has substituted electricity as a
motor on four horsecar lines and on one
cable line. "What we will do further is an
other question. We do not claim to
knowâ fact we do not know. There
are some lines upon which the cable will
probably always . be used, because it will
always be the best and most j economical
power." â -â ',; â â â¢ JfyffÂ£f;
Of the cable the article in the Journal
says that started twenty- two years ego
the cable road was a success mechanically
and. financially from .the, first, and its
fundamental features .were quickly copied
on Â» other roads in this City and in other
cities. The Journal continues: j f&W'^vJ;
Articles have appeared in Eastern journals
from time to time ,to encourage San Francis
cans In the belief that the cable system was
really more economical than the electric,
except on long suburban lines, but for about a.
year and a quarter the Market-street Railway
i Company has owned electric * roads of its
own and has been making data for itself.
Snow ; has not v bothered the . Â«.' company
at all on its cable roads, nor has the frost
closed up the slot. | The j expense j for cables
has not been abnormal, and the original con
struction was most substantially done in iron
and concrete. In fact, the conditions for cable
road traction in San Francisco are the equal of
any in the world, and ; the construction and
operation of these roads are unsurpassed. The
Market-street Company, however, has become
convinced that the people prefer to ride on the
electric-cars, and that the electric-cars carry
the people more cheaply than does the caMe.
These results were not obtained from a few
eleotric-cars run >on level lines and at high
rates of speed, but from the operation of up
ward of 150 cars at from IJ_ to 'Z\_ minute
headway at times and on lines navihg grades
as high as 14 J -J per cent. Most? of these cars
are subject to frequent interference from the
heavy wagon traffic on the downtown streets,
and all of them' are governed by the rule
ordering a redaction of speed j at ' the crossing
of each intersecting street. â¢ ; ; >"?â¢*
I The company began cautiously by changing
its old horsecar lines 'to electric lines. Later
it decided to equip with : electricity the route
of a franchise designed to be a cable road and
for which $30,000 worth of cable material had
already been bought. 1 The routes of all new
franchises were. then ordered to be equipped
as electric roads, and finally it was decided to
abandon the. use of the cable on one lineâ Ellis
streetâ and substitute electricity. -
:. This last decision i 8 considered significant
and one foreshadowing the changing of , not
only all cable roads on 'the level to electric
roads, but the changing of ' all cable roads ac
cessible to electric cars, and not only the cable
roads of the Market-street ; system, but also
those of the other cable roads in the city. The
Market-street Company . maintains at present
six cable power-houses and each has its two
large monthly Items of fuel and labor. Every
time a cable power-house can be dispensed
with and the lines operated by electricity that
power-house item, labor, is wiped out and
the " . item * ' of ?'.*- fuel .. is A reduced both
on account, of the less fuel required per car
mile for an electric road as against a cable
road and because the cable-houses are usually
run non-condensing," whereas In the electric
power-house the engines are run condensing.
*.â¢*- * .-..There is a cable line on Oak street re
quiring a cable 26,000 feet I long that. Is now
under reconstruction as .' an electric road.
When this road is changed the large cable
power-house at Oak and Broderick streets,
from which both Oak and Ellis have been run,
will be shut down.' â ,> - ?'-*:
- The grades on the Howard, the Post and the
McAllister street . lines , are . all perfectly prac
ticable for electric cars, and in case they are
changed i from V cable to electricity two more
power-houses can be dispensed with. ' .
Electricity has, perhaps, replaced the cable
on â > the â¢ level 'â  and on easy grades, some cable
men say. but on heavy grades the cable will
| always be retained. V, ". i .. y .*. '?:.">:. *.
.When we see the dally spectacle ; of electric
cars unaided climbing 14' ._ per cent grades in
San Francisco and 15 per cent grades in Oak
land, and by means of a simple auxiliary de
vice ascending a .25 per. cent grade in San

i to hold, the impregnability of any cable propo
sition is open to question. *<â¢ ' â¢ <. ''

WREN STERNBERG
IS SENTENCED
That Will Be a Remarkable
Scene in Wallaces
Court. V
TRIUMPH OF JUSTICE.
A Transgressor of Election Laws
Really to Go to the Peni
tentiary.
WILL GET SIX YEARS TO-DAY.
Justice â ; for a Tool Who Steered False
Registration in Senator Ma
honey's District.
There will be an interesting and some
what remarkable proceeding in Judge
Wallace's court to-day.
. Louis Sternberg, steerer of false regis
tration | and general violator of election
laws, will stand up to receive again, and
for the last time, a double sentence of six
years in the penitentiary.
It is an interesting and remarkable
spectacle . when a reckless violator of the
long and grim statutes which watch from
the codes over those â¢'palladiums of
liberty" rises and shows that j such laws
can be really made to. work for once, even
on the surface of political iniquity.
It is somewhat remarkable, too, that
Mr. Sternberg's final sentence should
come so speedily. '-;-â¢--',
It is not so much as two years since J.
H. Mahoney became again a distinguished
Senator, and here Senator Mahoney is but
beginning his patriotic stir amid tho noble
activity of another Republican campaign.
Ihe last election of Jerry Mahoney by a
free people and an nntrammeled Sam
Rainey is simply a disassociated event by
which it is convenient to remember the
time when Louis Sternberg was first
thrown into jail. â¢ : yyT X â '.*_*;-â 
J. AH. Mahoney became again a State
Senator in 1894. Twelve and one are thir
teen and four are seventeenâ only sev
enteen months since Louis Sternberg was
arrested for adding to the great register
the names of American citizens who were
not only addicted to the opium habit and
whose shoes needed half-soling, but who
had the further misfortune not to live in
Senator Mahoney's district.
In that time no witnesses of importance
have died, but two appeals have taken
their course through the Supreme Court
and now the culprit stands at the very
door of the penitentiary. Something ap
pears in Sternberg's case to have gone
wrone with the political pulls and- the
lawyers with their tripping delays. Now
there are Cohen, Buckley, Martinet and
the rest who were run in at about the same
time, and they are all right yet. Poor
Sternberg has been fairly railroaded to San
Quentin. *r . . _ .
At the time of the last election it was
discovered; that the Forty-second and
Forty-third Assembly districts had been
extensively colonized. From single
rooms in cheap lodging-houses many vot
ers were registered, ana even the Baldwin
Hotel, where Senator Mahoney happened
to live, was given as the residence of a
suspiciously large number of citizens who
were not used to living in such sumptuous
hostelries. y^A-Ayf: -*'/â¢â¢.-?--
It was found that some alleged residents
of the Baldwin Hotel were registered from
storerooms occupied only by dusty trunks
and weaving spiders. Senator- Mahoney
was shocked at these discoveries, and Mr.
Sternberg will be shocked to-day.
Sternberg was convicted on two charges
months ago. On appeal he was granted a
new trial in one case and he was again
convicted.
The appeal in the second case was dis
missed . day i before yesterday and that is
why he will rise for final sentence to-day.
The two sentences will probably be the
same as the original onesâ three years on
each charge.- . v . y<v â .*â¢;
There is also one thing about, Louis
Sternberg's case that is not at all remark
able. The law's justice is meted out to
the poor tool of, others, while the, princi
pals, whoever they may be, who are
wholly responsible for this debauchery of
a popular, election, i are in no danger of
seeing the bunk in a felon's cell.

A WHISTLING LARYNX.
The Unique Case of a Young Lady in
y A"aA< :A.ia . Connecticut.
Dr. Carl E. Munger of Waterbury con.
tributes the following article to the cur
rent issue of the Medical Record:
Miss Florence W- â aged 19, with a
larynx perfectly normal in appearance and
function, can whistle at any time without
tke use of her lips, tongue, pharynx, soft
or hard palate or cheeks. If the mouth
is opened, the tongue pulled out and held
firmly between the thumb and index fin
ger, as' is customary on inspecting the
larynx, and a laryngeal mirror is held in
position upon the soft palate, pressing it
back against the posterior pharyngeal wall,
the patient during examination can
whistle very clearly and loudly enough
to be heard in . any part of a
large room. The position of the vocal
chords is as follows : There -is close ap
proximation of the vocal chords for their
anterior three-quarters, while posteriorly
there is left a triangular space, : which
is more or less encroached upon as high
or low notes are produced ; at the same
time the ventricular bands are constantly
changing their positions, according as the
note is high or law. This young lady
says her range is about one and a
half octaves. She further says that a
cousin, a young boy, possesses this power
of laryngeal whistling, bat to a very lim
ited degree, and that in her own case she
has been able to whistle in this peculiar
manner since childhood. .'. The or
dinary definition, of "to*, whistle" is
"to utter a - Kind of musical sound
by forcing the breath through a small ori
fice formed by contracting the lips" ("Cen
tury Dictionary"); it must then be added
that "to whistle" is as above, but with this
addition, "or make a musical sound by
forcing the breath through a small orifice
left by the partial approximation of, the
vocal chords, the only, other anatomical
aids being the ventricular bands!"' '
The objection that this is not a whistle
cannot hold, as a proficient singing mas
ter has assured me that the sound is purely
a whistle, and not a singing or speaking
note. This is then a unique case of the
production of the whistle in the larynx
unaided by the lips, tongue, cheeks or
plate. , .
Russian emancipation of the serfs took
place in 1861. At 'tbat time 22,000,000 serfs
who had been the property of 103,000 no
blemen were given their freedom. The
cost of the emancipation to the Govern
ment was Â£65,000.000.
MISS FRANCES WEYMAN.
MISS FRANCES WEYMAN IS ONE OF
the pretty young ladies now visiting
friends in Hanford. As is well known in
Hanford, Miss Weyman left her home in
Omaha, Nebr., in search of good health.
Before her arrival she was but the ghost of
her real self. Now she is strong, brimful
of energy and perfectly beautiful. Al-
though she used several bottles of Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla, her face showed no
signs of a pimple, a blood spot or a sarsa-
parilla trademark. The reason is obvious.
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla, unlike the
iodide of potassium sarsaparilla', contains
only California herbs and herbs
that will dry up the facial blemishes and
purify the blood without throwing out
spots on the face. Listen? to Miss Wey-
man: "You may tell , the , manager of
Joy's Veeetable Sarsaparilla that I am de-
lighted with California in general and with
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla in particular.
I almost wish I was a native. Don't you
see what a great thing it is to have people
speak of your own State as being great in
health-restoring qualities? Yes, when I
return to Omaha I will be sure to carry
several bottles of Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilla, and I shall always praise the
remedy, as it has done me great good."
The experience of Miss Frances Weyman
will be your experience if you try Joy's
Vegetable I Sarsaparilla. . ; Don't allow a

EOEEOLOSE: THE MOETGAGE.
Senator Morgan's plan to force the Cen
tral and Union Pacific Railway companies
into a fair and just settlement with the
Government is a good one, because it pro
poses to deal justly with the corporations
and at the same time protect the Nation.
The more direct the Government moves in
the premises the better the people will be
satisfied. The people of California demand
the adoption of the simplest and most di
rect way to secure to the Government its
! rights, and to ; oblige a recapitalization of
the properties upon the basis of their ac
tual value. The whole matter should be
resolved into a common-sense business
proposition and transaction, and con
ducted upon exactly the same lines of pro
cedure as a merchant or .money-lender
would undertake the collection of a debt
which the debtor was resorting to question
able methods to evade the payment of.
These railway companies owe the Gov
ernment a given sum of borrowed money
which is secured by mortgage. They not only
refuse to pay the debt, but they are making
every effort possible to "' practically fleece
the Government out of the entire sum due
as well as that to become due. Now were
the Government an ordinary business man
he would immediately proceed to foreclose
his lien and sell the property by auction.
If the mortgagor were able and willing to
buy in the property at a price that would
cover the indebtedness and expense of
foreclosure all would be well and good.
But if he did not, and there were no other
bidders offering enough to justify a sale,
why the mortgagee would himself bid in
the property and thus cancel his claim.
' There is' no need of red tape or mysteri
ous circumlocution in this matter, and
above all, there is no occasion whatever
for 'any kind of a refunding act or for a
compromise. These railroad companies
are not objects of charity that the Nation's
bowels of compassion should be turned in
side out for their accommodation. They
are enormously wealthy corporations; the
debt is a pist one; it is due; the payee has
it in his power to collect the debt; the
property is worth a great deal more than
the debt; the law makes the process of
collecting it speedy and simple, therefore
let the mortgagee proceed forthwith to
send the property to the auction block.
That is the business way of doing things.
SUGGESTIONS ' ON PAVING.'
While the Merchants' Association and
the wheelmen are working so industriously
for the repaying of Market street, it is
well that a few simple suggestions in con
nection with the subject be considered.
There has already appeared the possibil
ity of a clash between the City and the
tramway companies regarding the repay
ing of the space between the tracks and
for two feet on 'either side. The question
has arisen as to whether the City can com
pel the companies to repave these parts of
accepted streets so as to make them con
form to a style ot pavement different from
that which the company has put down.
As that is a legal question it may be dis
cussed in the courts. Aside from its legal
phases, however, there are practical mat
ters to be considered, and they are of the
greatest importance. y
The cable companies long ago laid be
tween their tracks a pavement composed
of basalt blocks set in concrete. The ab
solute rigidity of this pavement is *an ex
cellent preservative of the underground
works of the roads, but as a pavement for
general traffic it is one of the worst that
could be devised. The sole trouble is its
perfect rigidity. It is one of the' most dur
able of pavements; but it is highly de
structive to wagon" traffic, although it is
smoother and better looking Â« than any
other form of block pavement. :
The question is, Would it be advisable
to pave Market street with asphalt or bi
tuminous rock and leave the spaces be
tween and for two feet on either side of
the tracks as they are at present? That
would make an odd-looking street. One
of the results of the plan would be to
throw wagon traffic â¢ upon â¢ the smoother
parts of the street, thus reducing the wear
on the parts required to be kept in order
by the street railway companies. If the
horsecar tracks at present existing outside
the cable tracks in Market street are per
mitted to remain we shall likely find it
impossible to maintain a smooth pave
ment in Market street. *
Sansome street offers an instructive ob
ject lesson. It will be observed there that
a channel has been sunk in the bituminous
pavement where the wheels on one side of
a truck run along the car rails - and those
on the other side* are kept in a definite
course outside the track. This will be
found to be the case in every street which*
has car tracks and a bituminous pavement,
and it represents the one great drawback
of this kind of pavement. In streets where
there are no car tracks this difficulty does
not appear. "Whether to lay a course of
granite to receive the outside wheels of
wagons in case bituminous rock is used
for paving, or lay the entire pavement
with bricks or basalt blocks in a bed of bi
tuminous rock in order to obviate this dif
ficulty, are considerations that should re
ceive attention in all plans for the repay
ing of Market street. .%/.',.
KELLY AND MAHONEY.
The almost undisturbed harmony which
prevails in the conduct of the Republican
campaign in the Fourth and . Fifth Con
gressional districts is a striking illustra
tion of the value of honesty and fair deal
ing in politics. Every movement made by
the regular authorities of the party in
these districts to provide for the election
of delegates to the State Convention was
so fully in accord with the best traditions
of Republicanism and was so clearly di
rected to the end of obtaining a fair ex-
pression of the sentiment of the voters
that the results have been hailed with sat
isfaction. by the whole mass of ; that intelli
gent body of citizens who constitute the
dominant element of the party. *â¢ >
In these districts we have that fullness
of Republican harmony .which assures
victory. Against the result of the regular
primaries there is no contest, no formally
entered protest of any note and scarcely
even an intelligible voice of dissatisfaction.
One ugly blot, however, marp the fair pros
pect of this situation. Outside the regular
proceedings of the district committees
there was another proceeding undertaken
by men who ? unfortunately are in a po
sition to claim to be Republicans. This
was the farce known as the Kelly-Mahoney
primaryâ a farce not yet played to the end
and which it may. yet ; be ; left to the State
Convention to deal with.
Kelly and Mahoney are among the
worse specimens of that class of t low poli
ticians who thrive by the gang of voters
they can control and whose : widest reach
of politics extends ho further than from
a slum barroom to a municipal office with
perquisites â  attached. Their higuest wis
dom does not go beyond a belief that they
can obtain places for themselves and their
henchmen by making trouble if they are
not placed. It was . with this * idea they
started their ' bogus primaries : and by
stuffed ; ballot-boxes showed something
like a vote ; for ? their dummy \ delegates.
They believe in their self-conceit .. that
"they can and are. making trouble for the

Republican party. They do nbt see how
easy it is for the party to get rid of them,
how cleanly, the State Convention can
sweep them out of the door, how
promptly from that position they ' can be
dumped into the rubbish heap.
The regular Republican party of San
Francisco has not found it worth while as
yet to deal seriously with these would-be
bosses. It has exposed their tricks, re
vea'ed the fraud of their forged proxies,
shown the silliness of their so-called
primaries, but having in this way ren
dered them harmless has not stopped to
light them further. It may, however, be
yet necessary to do so. ' There is a degree
of impudence that comes close to being an
insult, and it is that kind which Kelly
and Mahoney are now venturing upon.
Republicanism cannot much longer permit
these fellows to insult her by pretending
to represent her, and men who wish to
stand well with the party had better cease
to give them even a color of support.
STEONG MEN NEEDED.
It is of the utmost importance that the
Republicans send men 'â¢ of * conspicuous
ability to the St. Louis convention. This
cannot be done unless the Congressional
districts make careful selection of dele
gates to the State Convention. The char
acter of the men representing California
in the National Convention will measure
the extent to which the State shall receive
consideration. The great need of . Cali
fornia is that its value to the country
should be properly understood. The col
lective Eastern mind is unable without
persistent and intelligent instruction to
appreciate the magnitude of the National
interests centering in this State. Some
occurrences have happened' lately to ex
pand Eastern understanding, among them
the fight on the railroad funding bill, but
even in that case the opposition to the bill
is not properly understood. The St. Louis
convention will offer the greatest of oppor
tunities for California to impress itself
upon the country, and this can be done
only by men of highest ability and char
acter. -aaA
The sending of an unpledged delegation
would more than double the power which
such men could wield. If unpledged they
would be an uncertain quantity that must
be reckoned with, and if able they will
know how to employ the advantage for
the good of the State. In an interview
published in Thursday's Call Colonel W.
R. Smedberg, who with other leading Re
publicans has a thorough comprehension
of the situation and insists on an un
pledged delegation, recalls a historical
incident that bears on the present case.
When Lincoln was up for nomination the
first time California had an unpledged
delegation in the convention and cast its
first ballot for Seward. Had it. been alert
and quick it would have swung to Lincoln
at the first indication that his nomination
was likely, but instead of seizing the op
portunity it Dermitted Ohio to slip in and
secure the glory. We need a delegation
that would know the value of such a situ-
ation as that and be able to turn it to the
best account. y: y;y
A delegation tied up with instructions
would be helpless in such an emergency.
As Hugh Craig, president of the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce, has
pointed out, California comes third in the
rollcall of States, but party success is,
hardly expected in the . two States which
precede it, Alabama and Arkansas. "Cali
fornia," he says, "is in the Republican
column, and for that reason our eighteen
votes may count for considerable." * If
unpledged they have a superior advantage,
by reason not only of representing the
first Republican State called, j but also
because at any moment they can change
their vote and lead the victory for the
candidate 'whose nomination' seems as
sured. It is encouraging to find so many
able Republicans taking this wise view of
the situation.. [-'A'- -'' '<
SANTA CLARA SUPERVISORS.
The accusation filed against four of the
Supervisors of Santa Clara County, charg
ing them with illegally auditing claims
and allowing sums on â¢ contracts in excess
of bids, is evidently one of those. emana
tions of spite and malice which come so
easily from men of little responsibility and
against which even the best officials cannot
be assured, no matter how faithfully they
perform their duties or how much they
may be esteemed and respected in the
community they seive. . ,-' . . â¢_ [
Of the four accused Supervisors two, S.
F. Aver and Adolph Greeninger, have
served the county for many successive
terms. Their course of official conduct
has been again and again submitted to the
arbitrament of the people, has been studied
in the fierce light of political campaigns
and has been invariably approved by the
unequivocal indorsement of a re-election.
To the work of these two men is largely,
if not mainly, due that excellent adminis
tration which has given Santa Clara
County so enviable a reputation through
out the State. The superb highways, the
handsome public buildings and the well
kept institutions of the county are all
monuments to their energy, their fidelity
and their honesty. With such attestations
of good work performed, Supervisors Ayer
and Greeninger are not likely to be dis
turbed by the futile charges against them.
The other accused Supervisors â John
Roll and George Elmer Reaâ have not
been in office so long, but they are hardly
less well-known in the county. Roll is one
of those sterling workingmen who consti
tute one of the best elements of American
life and is so personally esteemed that
although a Democrat he was elected from
one of the strongest Republican
in the county. Rea is one of the foremost
of the younper business men of that sec-
tion of the State and he, too, was elected
Supervisor by a vote which exceeded his
party strength. In official life they have <
increased the esteem in which they were
held before the election, and proven by the
unmistakable proofs ' of good work done
their zeal in the public . service and their
integrity in the performance of all duties.
The motives which: underlie the accusa
tion made against the Supervisors will
sooner or later be made" known. It will
then be possible a for - the; public to pro
nounce clearly concerning the character of ,
the man who ;' has made it. For a little
time the report that such charges have
been made against them may be injurious
to the accused officials where they are not
known ; but it will not be for any great
while. The trial which will confound the
accuser will exonerate the innocent, and
the people of Santa Clara County will have
further reasons to feel well' satisfied? with
the votes by which they elected Ayer,
Greeninger, Roll and Rea to the office of
Supervisor. ; ; , ;. ; ;;;', '?.;.'." ;, â '?â¢', .".A;.

running in the direction of any candidate. It
is Impossible to.tell in advance all that is
likely to occur in a convention, and a delega
tion should not be so bound ; by pledges that
it cannot act ' intelligently if ' unex
pected * conditions ] arise. McKinley *> is \ very
plainly the first choice of California Republi
cans ; but they also have their second choice,
which is Allison, and would also have a third
choice should the contingency appear that
would make such a choice necessary. The
proper thing to do is to select a delegation
which can be depended upon to faithfully
represent the wishes of the party and leave it
free to act as patriotism, intelligence and cir
cumstances may dictate.
Unpledged Delegations.
San Francisco Post.
We heartily agree with our esteemed con
temporary, The Call, in nearly everything it
says concerning an unpledged delegation jto
the National Republican Convention. This is
a duty wo owe ourselves, as The Call in its
"unpledged delegation" talk is merely reiter
ating what we said a week or two ago.
This State, having no favorite son for Presi
dent, 'could gain nothing by sending to St.
Louis a delegation pledged to the favorite son
of some other State. When the latter came to
distribute the favors, in the event of his nom
ination and election, he would naturally tell
the delegates that their constituents ought to
be satisfied with the knowledge that he was
grateful. Having promised everything to the
unpledged States, he would, if an honorable
man, fulfill his obligations and let us slide.
Divested of some of the romantic buncombe
with which it is surrounded in the school
boots, the "great act" of a sovereign people
assembled in convention to choose their ruler,
is nothing more than a quadrennial distribu
tion of the Federal patronage. The "great
leaders" who appear in the convention are
there either looking for an office for them
selves or their friends, and if any State dele
gation takes a higher view of its function than
these men it usually is sent home empty
handed, but with a large stock of valuable ex
perience. yy?y
â¢ It is the duty of the Californians who will go
to St. Louis to bring back some game. If they
can do this by voting for McKinley they should
vote for him. If it appears that McKinley is to
be defeated by the practical politicians who
are combining against him they should not let
sentiment _overn them, but should crawl be
neath the victor's tent without delay. Califor
nia ought to have a man in the next Cabinet,
besides a minister plenipotentiary or two and
the usual small things. But the Eastern poli
ticians will not concede anything unless the
coast combines and creates the situation neces
sary to get it. "â¢

WORTHY OF IMITATION.
Berkely Advocate. - .
A study of the motives that direct the actions
of the average man has evidently been made
by the officials of the San Mateo Electric Rail
way to some purpose. y Heretofore \ the only
method in vogue on any line toward the check
ing of carelessness and inefficiency on the part
of employes has been* summary dismissal for
cause. ; The j cause, however, could not be es
tablished until after I. the damage ?â ; had been
done, and the remedy was \ very much ? like
locking : the stable-door after the horse had
been stolen. â .;â â - -,-:aa â¢ -:..;â¢>.>
; The San Mateo ; company takes . the opposite
course and instead of waiting I lor the damage
purpose to lead the employes of their own vo
lition ;to - such a standard of . efficiency that
there will be no dereliction of duty and no
need of punishment. Prizes are offered as in
centives to motormen and conductors, which
will ' be â  awarded ' after ; a record covering six
months of service. -â  The prizes range from $40
in cash to $10. .: . -'Â .
â â ;â¢"â¢ Under : this incentive every . employe will
strive to meet all the : requirements to the ut
most of his ability. Accidents will be averted
by the motormen and passengers will be more
courteously served by conductors. Every em
ploye has something to look forward to and
will give his entire attention to duty. Every
person concerned will be the gainerâ the em
ploye in his ambition and pocket, " the patron
of the road in the gratification afforded him by
travel over a line insuring both safety and
courteous attention, and the company will be
very largely the gainer from all the results."
It is to be hoped that the experiment will be
observed with profit by other lines.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
NO DEAL WITH DEMOCRACY.
AN Earnest Populist Protests Against a Sur
render op principles for the sake
of Office-Seekers. ,
San Francisco, April 22, 1896.
â¢ To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
I notice in your morning issue a cartoon and .
editorial oa the rumored unholy alliance of
the Populists and Democrats. I can hardly be
lieve such a thing possible, and sincerely hope
you may be mistaken. Should the Populist
party merge its individuality in the putrid
carcass of the Democratic party jj thousands
would desert it, whereas should It spurn with
contempt such a proposition, lo Its standard
would come many voters from both the old
parties. Individual ambition should be sub
servient to the welfare of Government, and
when to gratify it all principle and decency is
lost sight of, then a long farewell to the party
permitting the sacrifice. As a humble mem
ber of the People's* party the very talk of such
a proposition fills . me . with disgust. Let us
standby our principles, which are preserva
tive of the rights of the masses and political
purity. Ben Morgan.
THE UNCERTAIN SOUTH.
San Diego Union.
It looks very much as though the South were
to be a doubtful factor in the coming Presi
dential election. Already there are ample
indications that it will not be solidly Demo
cratic as in days of yore. In Georgia the Re
publicans and Populists have perfected a plan
for the capture of the State at the next elec
tion. They intend to fuse in the interest of
fair elections, tne plan being to give the Re
publicans the Governor and the Populists the
United States Senator. Moreover the breaks
in the ranks of the Democracy in Alabama and
the Carolinas are widening, and fusion on one
basis or another is likely to be the watchword
during |the next few months. How far the
Republicans may profit by this general break
ing up remains to be seen. They have every
thing to gain by it if they will.

LADY'S WAIST WITH '/ JACKET
FRONT.
A novel sleeve is shown here which will be
appreciated by the woman who wishes to keep
in advance of the styles. It is closely fitted,
with a circular cape-like top. The jacket front
is also much liked, allowing variety, in the
shape of vest and blouse effects. The sim
plicity of the shape is _ relief from the revers
and large collars.
A dress of plain black mohair had a vest of
yellow crepe with rows of black Insertion put
on lengthwise. A frill of lace to match was set
on the edge of the jacket front. r. ,
A dress of dark blue canvass cloth, through
which an emerald green silk lining glimmered,
had a blouse of the green silk. â¢ -
Three buttons of emeralds, with a setting of
rhiiiestones,. were set on either side of the
jacket above the bust. A frill oi creamy guip
ure lace hung from the edge of the jacket,
being tapered towered the bottom, where it
ended at the darts.
A waist of black satin to be worn with a skirt
of black and white check, had ft vest of white
chiffon gathered very full. At the side, ap
parently set under the jacket, were frills of
white lace. A folded collar of brilliant green
ribbon was worn instead of the flaring collar
here portrayed. .... ,
The waist has the usual forms. ln the back,
with one dart In front. The- lining has two
darts on either side, over which the vest is

One of the prettiest sights on the bay for
a long time was the arrival of the ship
Dashing Wave yesterday from Tacoma.
The wind was blowing in strong squalls
from the southeast and the vessel sailed
in. One of the red stack tugboats at
tempted to speak her but whenever a
squall came.the ship would run away from
the steamer and the latter would have to
wait for a lull in the gale before she could
catch up. Finally off Goat Island the
Dashing Wave had to take in sail and the
tug towed her to a safe anchorage.
It was very rough on the bay yesterday,
but contrary to expectation very little
damage was done. ; There was a consider
able swell along the seawall and in conse
quence no attempt was made to pump out
the steam schooner Point Arena. The lat
ter has a hole in the hull forward and an
other aft, but as both have been patched
over with canvas Captain Whitelaw does
not anticipate any difficulty in pumping
the vessel and docking her on the
Spreckels drydock.

There was an unfortunate fracas on the
Australia after she docked. Peter Rey
nolds, one of the cabin-boys, assaulted
Second steward J. Barry and a free right
ensued. It was the outcome of a grudge
held by Reynolds for a number of repri
mands for dereliction of duty, and when
he eot the chance after the steamer
docked he "went for Barry." Officer
George Lake was . called in and he placed
Reynolds under arrest on a charge of bat
tery. Barry is a very capable man and is
an able assistant to T. K. James, one of
the most pepular stewards in the employ
of the Oceanic Steamship Company.
The Harbor Commissioners had a very
short session yesterday. President Colnon
and Commissioner Chadbourne were in at
tendance, but Commissioner Cole is still
absent attending to some urgent business
in Sierra County. In regard to the using
of Colusa stone in the building of the new
ferry depot the bond: men lor the contrac
torâC. J. McCarthy, R. W. Gorrill and A.
M.Simpsonâ wrote stating they would will
ingly use Colusa stone instead of Oregon
gray sandstone. In commenting upon the
communication President Colnon said that
no delay would ensue. The Risdon Iron
Works was delivering the pillars prompt
ly, and there was months "of work ahead
before the stonework would be reached.
If the matter had to be tested in the courts
he thought it should be done at once.
Another proposition advanced by the
president of the commission was to the
effect that as the board was making a fight
for the use of California material the Man
ufacturers'/Association should step in and
lend al) the aid possible. As matters
stand now the question of California or
Oregon stone will be tried in the courts,
and the Commissioners expect Colusa
stone to win the day.

COLONEL WARREN DEAD.
End of a Remarkable Career
After Nearly a Cen
tury.
A SOLDIER WITH LAFAYETTE.
He Was the Oldest Journalist and
Californian Pioneer on This
â¢ Coast. '
s
Colonel James L. Lafayette Warren died
Colonel James, L. L. Warren as He Appeared Shortly Before His Death.
at his home, 1036 Gilerrero street, Wednes
day at the advanced age of 90 years. .
In many respects he was a remarkable
man, having been the oldest member of
the Society of California Pioneers, the
pioneer journalist on the Pacific Coast,
with a distinguished career running in its
most active periods back more than three
quarters of a century. Colonel Warren
was born August 12, 1805, in Brighton,
Mass. He came to California in the ship
Sweden, with 200 fellow-passengers, arriv
ing here August 6, 1849. He was the father
of agriculture in California and though a
prominent writer and lecturer seventy
years ago his latter days were spent in re
tirement and obscurity among a col
lection of rare curios in this City. He had
collected curios for over eighty years.
â  Colonel Warren had been actively en
gaged as a public speaker for more than
seventy years, yet he was a successful
merchant in Sacramento during the
golden days from 1850 to 1853, when he
conducted an agricultural implement store
and accumulated a fortune, which he sub
sequently lost by flood and fire.
Sixty years ago he traveled abroad as a
speaker in company with men who after
ward stirred Europe, and for the past
seventy years was fortunate enough to ? be
quite intimately associated at times with
many of the eminent men of Europe and
America. * ' s
Colonel Warren's large private library
and museum, though unknown to all but
a few friends, represented nearly eighty
years of patient energy. He collected
thousands of autographs and photographs
of illustrious characters who belonged to a
dead and gone age ; he gathered rare coins,
pictures and bric-a-brac, and to the last
he could recall events of eighty years ago
without hesitation.
Among the interesting stories told of
him is one of his part as a sergeant and
"guard of | honor to ? Lafayette : during the
laying of the corner-stone .of Bunker Hill
monument in 1825. In 1823 ?he dug a can
non ball out of the ground at Bunker Hill
and retained it in his collection until hit
death.
â¢He was prominent in agricultural mat
ters in Massachusetts while the century
was yet young and he won medals of honor
and : certificates from the Massachusetts
State Board of t Agriculture, which show
that he got prizes at Faneuil Hall as a
boy. : In 1838 he won the prize of the Bos
ton Horticultural Society for the first to
matoes ever . produced in the State. He ?
himself imported the .seeds from Europe,
and in fact introduced the tomato to
â  America. ..
Ha ving arrived in California before sys
tematic agriculture = was, known he estab
lished an - agricultural journal, the Cali
fornia Farmer, and ! so \ became â  the father
of husbandry on the *: coast. For forty
years thereafter he was a persistent writer
on agricultural matters. tln 1853 he' made
the first sack of flour ever manufactured
in the State. When 'he : was 10 years old
he began to preserve his letters, newspap
ers and other things which "he believed
some day might become valuable. He
had complete files of the more important
magazines printed in America in his time
and a marvelous collection of coins and
stamps, pictures and books. He had about
2,000,000 newspapers in his collection.
In the earlier days he was a platform
lecturer with Elihu Burritt, the learned
blacksmith, with Senator Kellogg of Ohio,
the Rev. John Pierpont and Dr. Chalmers.
He conducted the Nonarntun Vale Gar
dens at Brighton, Mass.; from 1820 to 1845,
and in the visitors' book of that place
which he retained were the autographs of
Emerson, Webster, Clay, Calhoun, Long
fellow, Phillips, Bryant and of other
great men. '..'â ' :; -AAy
William Cullen Bryant and Colonel
Warren were intimate friends for over
half a century.
Colonel Warren traveled with Ole Bull
in Europe nearly fifty years ago, and in
1847 delivered temperance lectures abroad.
He never indulged in either tobacco or in
toxicating liquor, and he never partook of
food until he felt hungry. On attaining
his ninetieth year he was enrolled as the
oldest member of the Association of Cali
fornia Pioneers. â¢ n* . y.
The deceased leaves four daughters and
a son. His funeral will take place at 11

Louis C. Bresse. Formerly Private Secretary of James G. Fair and Named as One
of the Executors of His Earlier Will, Who Died at Ensenada Wednesday.
DEATH OF LOUIS BRESSE
Recovered of Pleurisy, He Sud
denly Succumbs to
Pneumonia. :'â â â¢
WAS TRAVELING IN MEXICO.
Under Advice of His Physicians He
Went Down South for a
Rest.
Louis C. Bresse, private secretary of the
late James G. Fair and named as one of
the executors of the earlier will, died sud
denly at . Ensenada, Lower California,
Wednesday morning, of pneumonia.
The news did not reach the relatives in
this City until yesterday, as the wires
were down between San Diego and En
senada, Yesterday the announcement by
wire brought sudden grief and consterna
tion to his mother and brothers | here, for
it was supposed he was on a fair way to
the recovery of his accustomed robust
health. :;,.; "A:aaa
For some time Mr. Bresse has been suf
fering from pleurisy, which caused some
thing like concussion of the brain, and his
condition was such that his family phy
sician, Dr. Tate, was constrained to call in
Drs. Robinson, Abrahams and Richter to
consult. 1 *-**-* ' -. . â¢ ,
He recovered at least the appearance of
health and under the advice of his physi
cians took the trip south for a rest.
Previous jto . his going, however, he felt
so well that he was rather disposed to
rebel against the doctor's orders. How
ever, as he said he had not taken a rest
from his business for many years he con
cluded to go. His wife and their two
children and Dr. Tate took the trip with
him. They went by steamer, leaving here
last Friday, and on the journey Mr. Bresse
took a cold which developed into pneu
monia and resulted in death. ". Â» * â  '. ;
From telegrams to his brother, Gus
Bresse, it is learned that the party are now
returning * overland from Ensenada and

APPLICANTS NEED NOT APPLY.
New System by Which the Courts
Can Relieve One Another in
Naturalization.
The making of citizens in the Superior
Court has been brought as ne ar to a sys
tem as is possible. A certain court, or two
of them, will hereafter devote themselves
to naturalization one. day in the week and
all applications will be heard there. ''; A
In each courtroom yesterday morning a
placard was posted announcing the days
on which the different courts would hear
applications for citizenship. The placard
stated that? on Mondays Departments 2
and 7, Judges Daingerfield and Sanderson,
would hear applications; on Tuesdays,
Departments 8 and 1, Judges Troutt and
Seawell; on Wednesdays,. Department 5,
Judge Hunt; on Thursdays, Department
11, Judge Belcner; on Fridays, Depart
ment 12, Judge Bahrs; on Saturdays, De
partment 4, Judge Hebbard.
There are missing from this list Depart
ments 9, 10, 3 and 6, Judges Coffey, Slack,
Murphy and Wallace. Judge Coffey has
announced his willingness to hear applica
tions for citizenship whenever the state of
his calendar will allow, but he has de
clined to set a stated day. He has the
bulk of the probate business, and he holds
court more hours in the week than any of
the other Judges. Judge Slack is also
willing to hear applications when possible,
but Judge Slack is presiding Judge, and in
audition has a threefold calendar. He has
civil, probate and insolvency cases before
him, and his calendar, with his duties as
presidine Judge, takes up all his time.
Judge "Wallace is Judge of Department
6, a criminal court. It is not unusual to
see his doors locked for an afternoon and
sometimes for a good part of the morning
as well, and he never holds court on Sat
urday; but Judge Wallace has refused to
hear any would-be citizen. He. has not
examined an applicant in a long time, and
when the Deputy County Clerk went
around to the Judges to arrange a
schedule of days for hearing applicants
Judge Wallace would not join. .
Judge Murphy of Department 3 was of
the same mind. *He says he won't hear
an applicant. He was asked to set a day â
any dayâ when applicants could come be
fore him, but he would not do so. His
calendar, is not a big one. During the
Durrant case no suits were assiened to
bim, and during the settlement of the bill
of exceptions which followed in the past
few months he has done -little but come
into court and grant continuances to
either side. .->i\-i-..'.,- .-..;. *'.'â !Â£Â£
, His department was in a great measure
passed oyer in the assignment of cases
while the bill of exceptions was pending,
and it is only recently that he has opened
court regularly for more than half a day.
He will not hear applicants, however, even
when he is not holding court, and so the
burden of this neglected duty falls on the
other Judges.
It is the practice of the Judges who hear
applicants to do so just after court opens
in the morning and in the afternoon. It
takes but a few, moments and the appli
cant is told to come back again for his
papers whenever the clerk thinks he has
time to make them out. It would cost the
Judges but the fraction of an hour a week,
if all that could do so take a share.

RATES NOT TO
BE ADVANCED.
Action on the New Tariffs
Has Been Indefinitely
Postponed.
THE HITCH AT CHICAGO.
May Mean the Disruption Again
of the Transcontinental
Traffic Association,
THE NEWS A GREAT SURPRISE.
Conditions That May Have Blocked
the Pan to Stifle Railroad
Competition.
Action on the proposed new rates has
been indefinitely postponed.
This was the substance of a message re
ceived yesterday from Chicago by General
Freight Agent Charles F. Smurr of the
Southern Pacific Company and the local
freight agents of the other transconti
nental railroads. It was sent in each case
by Chairman Countiss of the recently re
organized Transcontinental Traffic Asso
ciation. '.-'a : .a
Just what the full import of this omin
ous-sounding telegram is remains a mat
ter of conjecture, but one thing that it de
termines is that there are to be no new
rates put into effect on the Ist of June or
any other date in the near future; and the
wires were kept busy yesterday afternoon
conveying this information to the numer
ous freight agents in the interior.
It is not yet two months since the reor
ganization of the Transcontinental Traffic
Association was announced from the East,
and with this news came the naturally
expected further information that an ad
vance in through freight rates was to be
effected. There followed a loner session of
the transcontinental freight-rate commit
tee, an auxiliary of the Transcontinental
Traffic Association, at Milwaukee, and
then came the definite announcement that
new rates had been decided upon by the
various roads represented in that associa
tion, and that all that was necessary to
make them operative was the concurrence
of the roads east of the Missouri River, the
trunk lines between Chicago and New
York and the New England roads, none of
which were members of the association.
The session of the transcontinental
freight-rate committee held at Milwaukee
came to an end about ten days ago, and
since that time it is believed that the
chairman of the association, whose head
quarters is at Chicago, had been endeav
oring to secure the required consent of
the other roads interested.
When the Milwaukee meeting came to a
close it was stated that the new rates
would probably go into effect by the Ist
of May. Then, as days went by and there
was no new tariff schedule put into circu
lation, it was given out that it would
probably not be until May 15 that the ad
vanced rates would become operative; and
but a few days ago the opinion was ex
pressed by the" local representatives of the
railroads interested that it would be at
least a month before the revised schedule
would apply.
It was well known that all the proposed
changes had been decided upon, for the
full list of them has been in the hands of
the local railroad people for about a week,
and when all the delays occurred and re
curred those outsiders who were familiar
with the workings of these great railroad
combinations began to suggest tbat there
was possibly a bitch in the deal some
where. When such a contingency was
mentioned to the railroad people inter
ested they had only looks of pitying con
temDt for the daring doubter. In conse
quence the portentous news that came
over the wires yesterday was a great sur
prise to everybody concerned in this City.
In anticipation of the higher rates that
have thus been threatening the mercantile
community for the past six weeks or more
orders from the East have been hurried to
shipment, and in some cases orders have
been placed considerably in advance of
the usual time, in order to take advantage
of the prevailing low rates.
Had the new rates become operative
they would have entailed an increase of at
least 50 per cent on the importers of the
West, as the rates eastbound would have
undergone little or no change. In fact, in
some cases slight reduction would have
resulted for California products, and the
the general result of the new tariffs would
have been to encourage local enterprise by
making low eastbound and high west
bound rates.
Among the measures to be taken by the
reorganized Transcontinental Association,
to make possible the advance of rates as
proposed, was the subsidizing of the car
riers engaged in the ' transportation busi
ness via the Isthmus of Panama, viz.: the
Prcific Mail Steamship Company and the
Panama Railroad Company. The proposi
tion was to divide $72,500 each month -be
tween these two companies in the propor
tion of 55 per cent to the latter and 45 per
cent to the former. In this manner it was
expected to eliminate from the situation
the powerful competition of these compa
nies, but more particularly that of the
Panama road, which had always posed as
the friend of the people as against the
Southern Pacific Company and its allies.
The prompt manner in which the
Panama road fell into the plans of the
combination after its strong public protes
tations of intending to always remain an
independent factor in transcontinental
business created surprise and disgust
anions the local shippers who had, when
ever they could consistently, favored the
Panama line. It is now likely that the
Panama line will be again in the field as a
genuine competitor of the rail lines; but
Irom the expressions heard among the
local merchants it will hardly receive that
consideration which it . did before it
showed so eager a disposition to join its
former rivals in their plans to increase the
cost of goods to the consumers of the Pa
cific Coast by increasing the cost of trans
portation. .
The greatest significance of this indefinite
postponement of action on the proposed
rates is that it may mean the complete
disruption again of the Transcontinental
Traffic Association, as the principle, if not
the sole, object of that body is the main
tenance of rates at figures that will assure
a good profit to the carriers interested in
transcontinental business.
When it was announced that the ex
ecutive committee of the Transcontinental
Association was in session at Chicago last
Wednesday it was considered only a matter
of hours when the date for the new rates
being made effective would be fixed. The
day passed, however, without bringing
any news, and it was then hoped that the
matter would be decided early yesterday.
But the. hours went by. and when hope
was nearly again abandoned by the anx
ious railroad men of receiving definite in
formation, the news was flashed to them
that ail the labors of the past six weeks
had probably been for naught, and that
the old rates would be left unchanged for
some time to come, at least.
Exactly what caused the indefinite post
ponement no one here seemed to be in a
position to state; or rather there was an j
indisposition to hazard a surmise. This
much was learned,; however,; that the
hitch arose from one of three causes: One
or more of the roads east of Chicago had
failed to give its concurrence; one or more
of the trunk or New England lines had
failed to agree upon the division of the
through rates, or, there had been a dis
agreement among one or more of the
Transcontinental Traffic Association roads
as to how the Panama route subsidy should
be apportioned.
It was also asserted yesterday by a well
posted railroad man that one of the roads
east of the Missouri River, which is in the
hands of a receiver, may have witheld its
concurrence under the apprehension that
its action in indorsing the work and plans
of the association might not meet with the
approval of the courts, particularly that
feature involving the payment of a subsidy
to the Panama route lines in order to
stifle competition.
One of the old-time contentions between
the Western lines and the trunk lines
was the rate to be allowed the latter on
business destined for New York. The
trunk lines have insisted on 25 cents be
ing the minimum they should receive,
and it is believed that this old bogie may
have again caused serious trouble. On
some of the lower grades of freight the
through rate is 75 cents from San Fran
cisco to New York, and were the trunk
lines to demand 25 cents for their haul
from Chicago to New York it would leave
but 50 cents to be divided among the roads
between the Pacific Coast and Chicago,
which would not leave a fair compensation,
it has been claimed, to these carriers. ,
â ; Further and more definite news of the
situation is anxiously awaited from Chi
cago by merchants and railroad men alike.
WOULD NOT ANSWER.
James A. Gibson Will Invoke tbe Aid
of the Federal Constitu
tion.
James A. Gibson has been committed to
jail for contemnt of court, but he has
brought his case before the Federal courts,
so the order committing him was merely a
formal proceeding.
Gibson was asked Wednesday to tell
what he knew of the sudden disappear
ance of $22,000 from his brother's room just
before that brother died. J. A. Gibson and
bis mother, Mrs. Emma Yorke, left sud
denly for Denver. Gibson was stopped at
Sacramento and charged with grand lar
ceny, and his mother was ordered brought
bacK from Denver on a similar charge.
Mrs. Yorke has been released, however, by
the Federal courts.
When asked what he knew of the disap
pearance of the money Gibson refused to
answer, on the ground "that his testimony
might lay him open to a conviction for
felony. He was given until yesterday to
fortify his position by authorities, but the
cases he cited did not satisfy Judge Coffey,
and he was ordered to answer. He again
refused and the order committing him for
contempt was made. He will invoke the
aid of the constitution of the United States
to release him.
There is a family dispute in regard to
the money. Mrs. \orke says the money
was given to her by her dying son. The
dead man's widow dissents, and naturally
desires to secure part of the estate.
URGED BY MERCHANTS.
A Change of Street Sweeping and
Sprinkling Specifications Asked
hy the Association.
The Merchants' Association, represented
by President Dohrmann, M. S. Kohl berg,
A. S. .Baldwin, J. W. Carmany, W. G.
Doane. H. D. Keil, A. Fusenot, K. Mel
rose, A. Roos and Charles Keilus, ap
peared before the Street Committee of the
Board of Supervisors yesterday to urge
that . the specifications for sweeping and
sprinkling the streets of this City be
changed so as to give better satisfaction at
a less expenditure than formerly.
President Dohrmann spoke at length
on the matter, but as the specifications
were lengtny and the committee desired
time to look the matter over carefully be
fore coming to any decision, the request
was laid over for a week. â  yy.y:
WANTS TO BURN GARBAGE
L. V. Merle Applies for a Writ
of Mandate Against the
Supervisors.
He Is Trying to Force His Bid of
$5500 and No Percentage to an
Acceptance.
L. V. Merle has applied to the Superior
Court for a writ of mandate compelling
the Board of Supervisors to award him the
contract for burning the garbage of the
City for the next fifty years.
Merle claims he was the highest cash
bidder for the franchise, and he demanded
the privilege on that ground. Merle's bid
was $5500 with no percentage. F. S.
Sharon's bid was $2510 and a graduated
percentage of the gross receipts, and A. M.
Shelly's bid was $1150 and a graduated
percentage, but not so large a one as
Sharon's. The . Merle bid was recom
mended by the committee in charge, but
the board awarded the contract to Sharon.
Sharon's bid, it was figured, would before
the franchise ran out be worth over
$1,000,000, while Merle's bid amounted to
no more than $5500 in any event.
Merle evidently relies on a recent deci
sion of the Supreme Court in which it was
announced that . a percentage of receipts
was in no sense a cash bid. The decision
was rendered in a fight over a street rail
road franchise in Alameda. The court
said that a road might be established for
the purpose of stopping competition, and
under those circumstances a very large
percentage of the receipts could easily be
offered, thereby insuring the possession of
the franchise for an , offer which would
eventually prove very small. The court
ruled the bid out because it was uncer
tain.
.. It is claimed, however, that this case is
no . parallel ' to the garbage franchise.
There is no uncertainty in the prospect of
a percentage of the receipts of the garbage
crematory, for the â  franchise allows . the
owner to charge 25 cents a load for burning
garbage, and the ordinance requires that
all the garbage in the City be taken to the
crematory for burning. As tbe percentage
is of the gross receipts, the franchise itself
provides for an income, which . cannot but
be a good one. â¢ ',-

visiting the southern part of the State for
some two weeks past arrived here yester
day afternoon. Among them are some of
the leading hotel men of the country.
They are known all over the world. With
the hotel men are about 200 ladies and
children, as many of the gentlemen brought
their families along. 'A; A: y. 'â 'â â¢. 'i
The visitors arrived by three special
trains of five cars each. There was one
train from New England, another from
New York and . another from Chicago.
These brought many people hundreds of
miles away from the starting point. The
trains carried the best chefs the country
affords, so that there was no stint in the
supplies while en route. Each train also
carried a skilled physician.
No one has been sick during the trip,
however, and there has not been mishap
or accident of j any kind. Every station,
on the trip, moreover, has been reached on
time. â  :._ *>â¢'.-_ -A-
All the hotel men are united in their
praises of Caiifo rnia and their hospitable
reception. They say they never dreamed
there was such a fair land, nor that their
trip would be so pleasant. yS^i?
Among the 'visitors are such eminent
hotel men as Tilley Haynes, proprietor of
the Broadway Central Hotel, New York,
and the United States Hotel, Boston;
Alvin Hulbert, proprietor of the Tremont
and Great Northern, Chicago; W.H. La
Pointe, one of the proprietors of Young's
Hotel. Boston; Simeon _ ord of the Grand

Wilcox of Chicago, superintendent of all
the hotels of the Illinois Central Railroad.
The latter gentleman is an ex-president of
the association. The '. hotels and eating
houses over which he has charge extend
from Chicago and Sioux City <to New Or-'
leans, or along 2600 miles of road.
"Our reception and what we have seen
has been a continual surprise," said Mr.
Wilcox. "From the time we reached Bar

unheard of." i,i^Ss____kTÃ_
Alvin Hulbert, the veteran proprietor of
the old Tremont and new Great Northern
hotels at Chicago, had a similar compli
ment to pay to the Californians. He has
been in Chicago since 1859. He has been
in California before, the last time being in
March. The Great Northern has about
700 rooms. The Tremont, though old and
famous, is comparatively â  small, having
but 250 rooms. The Democratic Conven
tion is expected to make things very lively
in Chicago for the hotel men, so Mr. Hul
bert said incidentally, y v
"About this trip and ; reception," con
tinned " the long-experienced boniface.
"There is nothing like itâ an ovation from
first to last. T. wouldn't know now to
describe it, ? and , the ? weather has ; been
superb all the way. This is the first rain.
Our people are < rather glad it ;., has ; come,
for we need a little rest. The courtesy ex
tended us, the kindly consideration every
where, has made us marvel." \ *
Beniamin H. Yard, the president of the
organization, whose * : full ; name ?is > Hotel
Men's Mutual Benefit Association of the
United ? States and ? Canada, spoke . briefly
in the same vein. He is proprietor of the
Monmouth House, Spring Lake Beach, N.
J., a little over an hour and a hall's ride
from Philadelphia. ? V
""We have been deluged with courtesies
from: the time we entered the State," he
said. '.'Then a committee of ladies met us
with flowers. Somebody brought fruit and
wine, too, and everything else you could
think of. The ; Western . Union Company
has been very good to us all. It has given
us all the free use of i its wires for any day;
we are ? out, and asked us not to be afraid
to telegraph our friends at any length."
,E. L. Merrifield, proprietor of the Con
tinenal Hotel, Twentieth and Broadway,
New York, is also along. He opened the
Continental in 1876 and has run it ever
since. He has been a hotel man nearly all
his life. "
i H. H. Brockway, proprietor of the Ash
laiM Hotel. New York, is another conspic
uous hotel man. He is an ex-president
of the association. ? . .
.W. J. AKers, president of the Ohio State.
Association, and proprietor of the Forest
City House, Cleveland, said: "We can't
say enough. We didn't realize the trip
could be so enjoyable. We have had one
of the committee always at our elbow."
George W. Lynch of the Hotel Florence,
San Diego, the newly elected president
of the association which has just held its
seventeenth annual session at Los Angeles,
told the story of the hotel men's arrival
and what they were now going to do. He
wore a yellow ribbon, duplicated by many
in the throng of hotel men at the Palace.

Christol Hartman Beats His Wife Adele
With His Fists.
There is a divorce suit pending between
Christol Hartman, a restaurant-keeper on
Washington street, and his wife Adele,
who keeps a lodging-house at 309 Sutter
street.
Yesterday morning Mrs. Hartman ap
peared in Judge Campbell's court with her
face swollen. > She was in a highly nervous
condition and poured into the ears of
Warrant Clerk Jackson a tale that roused
his indignation.
"My husband is insanely jealous of me,"
she said, "and I have had a terrible time
with him. This morning came to my
lodging-house, and after abusing me with
his tongue he struck me on the face and
body with his fists. I screamed for help and
ran away. I' am afraid of him and want
him arrested." .'.-'-
Jackson wrote out a complaint charging
Hartman with battery, which Mrs. Bart
man swore to before Judge Campbell, and
expressed the hone that no . time would be
lost in having him arrested.
'- Steuart Not at the Prescott.
Harry Steuart, the man \ arrested on a war
rant Wednesday aud charged with conspiring
with a woman to rob W. H. Palmer of $100, is
not, as was erroneously ' stated, night clerk of
the Prescott House, but acts in | that capacity
at the lodging-house at 807 Kearny street. -

CARS TO BE WITHDRAWN
Devisadero-Street Line Will be
Abandoned on the First
of May.
IT WAS NOT PROFITABLE.
Part of a Western Addition Service
That Has Been in Operation for
About Two Months.
On and after May 1, the people living in
the immediate vicinity of Devisadero and
Jackson streets who desire to reach the
southern part of the Western Addition, or
the western portion of the Hayes Valley
district, will either have to do considerable
walking or resort to carriage and bicycle.
On the date mentioned, it is the inten
tion of the Market-street Railway Com
pany to discontinue the service on Devisa
dero street, from Jackson to Oak.
This extension, with the rectangular
loop, bounded by Devisadero, Oak, Fill
more and Page streets, was put into opera
tion about two months ago, in the expecta
tion that there would be sufficient through
traffic to and from the Jackson-street ter
minus to make it a paying proposition.
Experience, however, General Manager
Vining said yesterday, demonstrated that
there was not a sufficient demand for this
accommodation to warrant the company
in continuing the serviceâ that is, the road
along Devisadero, from Oak to Jackson.
As now operated the cars run from Jack
son street along Devisadero to Page, east
on Page for four blocks to Fillmore, north
on Fillm ore for one block to Oak, along
the latter westward to Devisadero and
back to the point of starting.
When the service on the long Devlsa
dero-street arm is taken off the loop
bounded by Page, Fillmore, Oak and De
visadero will be kept in operation by run
ning one car around its ten blocks, which
service will continue to form the connect
ing link between the Page-street line to the
park and the Fill more- street line to the
northern and southern sections of the
City. In fact, no change will be made in
the transfer situation at the points where
this loop connects with other lines of the
Market-street Railway Company.
A FAMILY FEUD.
Walter B. Forsyth Swears Ont a War
rant for His Fathcr-ln-Law'g
Arrest for Perjury.
Walter Bailentine Forsyth, 106 Golden
Gate avenue, has been revenged on his
father-in-law, Bernard Connama, 914 North
Point street. Connama swore out a war
rant on Wednesday for Forsyth's arrest
on the charge of perjury in falsely swear
ing that Mary Connama, whom he mar
ried, was 18 years of age, whereas she was
not more than 17.
Forsyth went to Judge Low's court yes
terday morning and swore oat a warrant
for Connama's arrest on the charge of per
jury in swearing to a complaint that For
syth was a vagrant from April 1 to 18, and
testifying in court that he only met For
syth once, and that was on March 25. The
charge of vagrancy was dismissed by Judge
Joachimsen on Tuesday. * *;--'
Forsyth says be has been working for
his father, who is a' plumber, and was so
employed from April Ito 18. After swear
ing to the warrant for the arrest of his
father-in-law he went to the City prison
and surrendered himself on the perjury
charge. He was released on $2000 bonds.
COMPETING ELECTRICITY.
Franchise for the People's Mutual
Telephone Company Recom
mended.
A Promise Given to Reduce Rates to
Three Dollars a Month for .
Each Machine.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors decided yesterday to recom
mend . that j the franchise . asked by the
People's Mutual Telephone Company be
granted. :-A-A^y-
The company was represented by Robert
A. Friedrich, who stated solicitors were
already out getting subscribers and that
several thousand had been obtained. . :â¢â¢;
The company did not want to go any
further until the franchise was granted,
but as soon as it got a favorable answer
from the Supervisors work on the plant
would be begun at once. He thought that
the proposed competing system could ', be
finished in about six months. : -/'â  -Ay y. >y_'
supervisor Benjamin asked an explana
tion of the clause permitting the company
to charge $5 1 per phone, which is the same
figure now asked by the old company.
This was explained by Mr. Friedrich,
by Btating that sometimes -people in out of
the way places wanted telephones, and in
order to accommodate them at a profit the
company would be ' compelled :to charge
them a little more than the regular price.
He assured the committee, however,
that $3 was the rate to be ' generally
charged, and said that the company could
not very well * raise rates on their sub
scribers after they had contracted to fur
nish phones at $3 a month.
The committee was unanimously in
favor of panting the franchise, and the
order will be presented on Monday next.
The company will be permitted to lay
conduits for. the protection of wires to
transmit electricity for telephones and
telegraph service. y â¢
NEED NOT BE BALD.
Sheriff Whelan Sued to Recover the
Contents of a Halrstore.
Mrs. E. L. Lewis is trying 'Â to get from
the grasp of the Sheriff a miscellaneous
assortment of wigs, switches, curls, bangs
and toupees large enough to do away with
the prevailing feature of every front row in
the City's theaters, give the Sheriff a new
frontpiece and put whiskers on every one
of his deputies. The store of Mrs. Harriet
Nusworth, the plaintiff's mother, was at
tached just after Mrs. Nusworth failed,
about two weeks ago, and the Sheriff and
his more elderly deputies plunged greedily
into the stock and : secured enough fine
warranted genuine tresses to last them a
lifetime.
Mr?. Nusworth has now brought suit to
recover the ' ringlets from the meshes of
the law, and she alleges that the Sheriff
has secured $8584 45, worth of genuine
hair â  and : has converted the ; entire lot to
his own use. .What the Sheriff is <*oing to
do with it all is not suggested, bufhe may
explain in his answer. Anyway, he will
not; give up a lock, and she has been
forced to bring suit for the whole outfit.
The list covers two typewritten pages.
There are switches, loose, in bundles, in
drawers and in showcases; there are bangs
without * number, enouph for all Market
street and some to spare; a few cheap
toupees at $70 50 for the lot are mentioned,
and then there ".. is * one : toupee, evidently
almost an improvement on nature, which
is valued at $415. There are curls and
false fronts and frontpieces, raw hair and
netting, and then the list closes with men
tion of a whole lot *of powder, paint,
enamel, dandruff eradicator â  and other
toilet - accessories, and all of these th
Sheriff is supposed to be converting to his
own use.
FOUND HIS WIFE DEAD.
David Finnic Returned From His Kay's
"Work Only to View a Sad Scene.
When David Finnic returned to his
home at 1034 Nineteenth street at 6 o'clock
yesterday evening he found 'his wife dead
in bed and his pretty little 2-year-old girl
lying wide awake by her mother's side. â¢
Finnic had left the house at 6 o'clock in
the morning, after cooking his own early
breakfast, as was his custom. .There was
no evidence when death had come, except
the presence of the child's clothing in tho
bed, showing that the mother had been
preparing to dress her little one. Mrs.
Mary Ellen Finnic was 31 years of age and
a native of California. For some time she
had complained of a pain about tbe heart,
but there bad been no intimation of her
sudden death.
The neighbors had heard no sound, not
even a cry from the little child that bad
remained by its dead mother's side all
through the day, amusing itself with its
doll and waiting uncomplainingly '.until
its papa should come home.
For nearly twenty years Finnic has been
a teamster in the employ of the Hobbs,
Wall & Co. box factory..
MARKET STREET COBBLES
The Cycling Clubs Vigorously
Advocate a Change^ to
Bitumen.
The Moral and Political Influence of
15,000 Voters to Assist in
the Project.
If any influence, moral or political, can
accomplish the paving of Market street
from Valencia to the ferry landing, with
some other material than the present
rough and unsightly cobblestones, it will
be done if the cycling clubs of San Fran
cisco can work the change.
To accomplish this desirable end, T. H.
B. Varney ot the cycle brotherhood will
do all that in bis power lies to induce the
Supervisors, property-owners . and all
others interested in the welfare of the
City to have the principal business street
of the City look decent and modern. To
do this, the ancient cobblestones must be
taken up and a durable, noiseless, smooth
surface pavement put down.
"We will urge this question late and
early until we accomplish our object,"
said Mr. Varney. "We have as a starter
15,000 voters belonging to the various cy^
cling clubs in this City. I mean by this
business men who ride the bicycle from
their homes to their business places.
These will assist the organized clubs in
this movement.. ;; â¢
"Then, stablemen and owners of teams
devoted to carriage-driving will also assist,
and I am sure tbe storekeepers will most
heartily co-operate with ns.
"How much more pleasant it will be to
have a noiseless pavement in front of their
stores than, the tumultuous racket now
made by wagons rolling over the rough
cobbles, deafening everybody within a
block of the street.
. "We will urge it in circulars, we will
urge it in dodgers, we will urge it in every
conceivable but respectable manner until
we accomplish it. And when it is done
the people wUI wonder why it had not
been done years ago. , ;
' "It is said tbat. the teamsters, for some
unexplained reasons, are not in favor of
the present bituminous pavement, but
would gladly hail a smooth, durable road
bed in preference to the present cobble
paved streets." ; i { â '.
The Railroad Answers Johns.]
The railroad has answered the suit of William
E. Johns, who brought suitlto recover $20,000
damages for battery and false Imprisonment.
Johns was the man who offered a Hayes and
Polk street transfer at Grove and Polk streets
and who was refused a ride upon it. A row
ensued and Johns and the conductor got into a
fight. Johns was locked up for battery. The
answer of the company alleges that the trans
fer was not good unless presented at the point
of transfer, Hayes and Polk streets, and that
the plaintiff's trouble was brought on him by
his own acts. C. W. Cross appears for the rail
road.

was quite eloquent, and his well-rounded
periods stirred the feelings of the audience
to a high pitch. %_%%0.
The Hon. J. F. Sullivan presided. Miss
Georgiani opened the programme with a
fantasia of patriotic airs on the piano.
The chairman said that the sentiment
that had brought about this series of lec
tures was the same that inspired the peo
ple, in spite of the elements, to turn out in
such large numbers, standing together as
bey did for the principle of civil and re
gions liberty. He paid a glowing tribute
to the good work done by women in the
past, and asked where there could be
found a stancher friend of woman than
the mother and mistress of all churchesâ
the Roman Catholic Church.
His reference to the efforts of the Sisters
of Charity in the course of humanity, and
their brave and self-sacrificing conduct
on the battlefields was loudly applauded.
In introducing the reverend'orator of the
evening. Judge Sullivan paid the Chancel
lor a fitting tribute for his courage in
championing the cause of the church and
the people in the fight for civil and reli
gious liberty.
Fattier Yorke received an ovation on
coming forward to address the multitude.
"I am glad to see that the rain has not
dampened your enthusiasm," he said, "and
I am also g ad to see your interest in the
American Woman's Liberal League and
the great principle for which it stands
civil and religious liberty, and equal rights
among all men. [Applause.]
"At the' last lecture I showed tbat all
liberty began with the Lord and Savior,
and with a regenerated humanity. And.
coming down to the sixteenth century, I
showed that the fruit which we enjoy to
day, the harvest that we have gathered in,
how the citizen was taught his" rights and
duties; I showed how all this was due to
the old Catholic church and the Popes at
her head. [Applause.]
"To-night I wish to go a step further.
The period that I dealt with showed that
Christianity had won. All nations, though
speaking different tongues, belonged to
the communion of the ancient church.
We come now to a divided Christendom;
we come to a time marked by religious
rancor, marked by divisions in the Chris
tian household, with brother against
brother and father against son ; at a time
when the northern nations left thechurch.
"Hear and tremble lest any word of
mine should give offense, and I do not
wish to wound the feelings of any non-
Catholic. [Applause.] I deprecate religious
Btrife. If there has been religious rancor
sown in this community, and if we have
had to say some plain truths from time to
time in self-defense, the fault does not lie
with us as Catholics. It was only when
self-interest had conquered justice that we
were compelled to defend our
selves that those who come after
us cannot say: 'When you were
accused you had no defense.' 1
wish simply â¢to make known the facts.
Non-Catholics hate the cruelties of ages
gone by, and we Catholics likewise hate
them as much as they." [Applause.]
Father Yorke then went on to say that
the sixteenth century had opened most
auspiciously. This country had just been
discovered and the field of commerce
greatly enlarged. He showed how educa
tion and the social standard in all coun
tries of Europe were rapidly advancing.
The field of letters had been widened,
civil liberty had advanced, and European
society as a whole was developing in the
direction of a safe liberty. He quoted
from Protestant â  historians to show
that the Catholic church encour
aged the advancement of civil
liberty. The three great powers were the
people, the nobles and the king, and while
the church was at times at outs with the
nobles; and the king, she never through
all these thousands of years was in conflict
with the people.
--"On tins scene, so full of promise at the
beginning of the sixteenth century con
tinued Father Yorke, "broke what is called
the Reformationâ a revolt in Germany
and other northern countries against the
authority of the Popes. We find that in
the contest between the kings, the nobles
and the people at the .beginning of the
sixteenth century ' there was a con
federacy between the rulers and
the people. Now if you give a
man power to-day he wants more
to-morrow, and the "only way to curb him
is by a strong and healthy public opinion.
li the people are not united on questions
of morality, honesty and justice they may
be controlled at the dictation of the ruler.
"Now, in this country the neoDle are di
vided on political questions and those in
power scheme and plot to hold office, and
if they tell the people that the torpedo
boats are blue. they will .believe it. If
people are blind because of being divided
on political issues, then schemers will plot
against them to gain their own ends.
"Nobility grows np like the mushroom
inthe night. We have in these United
States a class , which if not noble, would
like to be."
Father Yorke pictured the contentment
of Christendom at the time the Reforma
tion began. He said tbat Italy was dotted
OTer with "publics- and it seemed as
though the spirit of justice was to go out
from the classic shades and extend over
the world..
"It was then." he said, "that the devil
sent religious intolerance into the world,
and the net k of liberty was placed under
the foot of tyrants. For 200 years Europe
was a vast battle-groundâ and all oh ac
count of religion. Catholics shot down
Protestants and Protestants shot down
Catholics, and the result was that after
200 years of warfare we find that the peo
ple were crushed and absolutism reigned
in Europe. And this was the outcome of
the Protestant Reformation.
"So in the early days if the Christians
were not united the world would not have
been conquered. They organized into one ;
society, with one head ; they went out into
the pagan nations and brought them into
the Christian fold, and it was such an or
ganization that held kines and nobies in
check and protected the rights of the peo
ple. [Applause.] y
"It is a good thing. for the church to
mind its own business and the state to at
tend to its own affairs. It is a bad thing
for the' church to try to run the state, and
a bad thing for the state to try to run the
church. [Applause.] Tbe Popes always
stood for this principle. During the mid
dle age 3 the independence of church and
state were! symbolized in the Roman pon
tiffs.
"After the Protestant Reformation all
civil hopes of Catholic Christians were
destroyed. It was arranged that as soon
as a body of Christians might separate
from the Church of Rome its only head
would be the temporal sovereign. So it
came to pass in England. Now, we find
that the first head of tbe divorced Church
of England was not a Bishopâ not a legiti
mate successor of St. Thomas of Canter
bury, but the royal hog Henry VIII.
"At the bottom of this revolt of this so
called reformation not so much religious
as political motives are to be looked for.
Kings have only one religion, and that is
that they believe in kings. Hence, we find
that Catholic kings have joined with un
believers in order to increase their own
power; and the worst of it all is that the
poor fools of people believed in them and
in their pretensions. If there be a lesson
in the history of the past, this should teach
us that the great and good God, who is the
author of religion, never intended that re
ligion should be a thing to be fought about.
The man who would attempt to convince
Americans to the contrary is either a fool
or a scoundrel. .* ?.
"The power of a well-ordered and well
organized public conscience met its death
blow in the so-railed Reformation. At the
same time slavery commenced to spread
about the earth. We inherited the writ of
habeas corpus, the famous magna charta
and the right of representation with tax
ation from our Catholic ancestors, but we
did not get from them the black inherit
ance of human slavery.
"However, we must make an exception
as to Indian slavery. Tne Spaniards who
came to the new world found rivers
glittering . with gold and enslaved
the Indian in order to get
him to . amass treasuers for their
conquerors. In Massachusetts and Vir
ginia we find no man prominent in church
or state advocating the cause of the slave.
In the south, however, we see some lazy,
eood - for - nothing monks taking the
trouble to say a good word for the poor en
slaved savage.
"In Santo Domingo we see the Domini
can Father Montesino getting up in his
pulpit and telling his hearers that they
were guilty of mortal sin in engaging in
the slave "trade, and bad about as much
hope of salvation as though they were
Turks. When reprimanded for his burn
ing words his superiors confirmed them,
and on the following Sunday Montesino
fave the people a stronger sermon than
efore.'.
-'La. Casas, the first American priest,
who, though a Spaniard, was the first to
receive the sacrament of holy orders on
this continent, was the great advocate of
the slave. From the court of Spain to the
court of Rome and back again went the
voice of the priest Las Casas; and down to
our own days comes that noble voice
Fleaaing for the God-given rights of the
ndian slave.
"Nor were the Popes idle. Paul 111,
who was held up by the reformers as a
tyrant and a bugbear, commanded that no
savage people, even though they should
not embrace Christianity, should be
molested in the enjoyment of their pos
sessions or liberties. Men may call this
papal interference in politics, but I would
rather appear at the last day beside such
Popes as Paul 111 than with our modern
patriots of to-day.
"In Mexico there are about 11,000,000
people, of whom 9.000,000 are of Indian
birth. It is true that these Indians have
not been taught to chase after the
almighty dollar on a bicycle nor to make
wooden nutmeg?, but they are free men
and have a chance to improve until per
haps they may be able to come up to our
level in these and other respects.
"When the slave trade commenced
among the Portuguese Molina and San
chez, the great Spanish theologians, laid
down the proposition that the traffic was
unlawful, and those who engaged in it or
profited by it were guilty of mortal sin.
The same doctrine is laid down by Soto, a
Jesuit writer, whose works, dated 1559, are
in the library of St. Ignatius College in
this City in their old-fashioned parchment
bindings.
"Another phase of the effort to divide
the people by setting them against each
other on religious grounds was the mag
nifying of the divine right of kings.
James I, the most learned fool in all
Christendom, wrote a book to prove that
all power in every department of govern
ment proceeded from the King's bounty.
This doctrine was long held in England.
"This same doctrine became very popu
lar throughout Europe. In Spain a court
chaplain had the nerve to say, when
preaching before the King, that the tem
poral sovereign had absolute power over
the lives and properties of his subjects.
The people arose en masse, and, dragging
the monk from the pulpit, they took him
to the Inquisition of ah places, and the In
quisition, whose sole business is supposed
to have been the burning of Protestants,
condemned this monk, after a long trial,
to retract from the same pulpit his false
and heretical expressions.
"This will give us a sort of idea of the
kind of liberty which our Catholic ances
tors believed in.** The Catholics of this
country can point back with pride to their
fathers, who made the first entry in the
volume of the history of American re
ligious liberty. The tradition of freedom
in America had not its origin in the so
called reformation; but 'its roots were
fastened deep in old Catholic soil. France,
the pioneer of religious liberty in Europe,
has at last recognized the old, solid prin
ciples Of freedom that have come down
from our Catholic ancestors. '. .
* "The countries which have kept the
Protestant ideas least diluted are tbe only
despotic nations which bear the Christian
name. . The Catholic nations are all con
stitutional monarchies or republics. Not
one Catholic despotism can we find. But
of the twenty-two republics of the earth
twenty are Catholic, or nearly so.
"Now we come, at last, to our title. An
old fable speaks of one who - sowed drag
ons' teeth, which sprang up in the form of
armed men fighting against each [other
and killing each other. Let us, if we love
our country, beware of those whose work
it is to sow dragons' teeth, whose only aim
is to spread strife among brethren."
THE BUILDING "TRADES.
Woodworkers Will Hold an Open Meet
ing To-Morrow Evening.
At the meeting of the Building Trades
Council last evening the woodworkers' del
egates announced that to-morrow even
ing their union would hold an open meet
ing to all members of the craft in their
hall at 1159 Mission street. The purpose
of the gathering will be to organize all
branches of the trade. In the woodwork
ers' line there are many departments/es
pecially in the mills. It is desired to
bring all classes of woodworkers into the
union which is possible under the rules of
the National amalgamation.
The Shinglers' Union is still seeking for
a representation in the council, and the
delay is caused by their work in many in
stances conflicting , with that of the car
penters. : The latter will not object so long
as the shinglers confine themselves to the
roofs and do not work on the side walls or
do repairing. Another hitch is that the
shinglers work by the piece while the oth
ers in the building trades work by the day.

HOW FLYNN MET KNIGHT
The Two Were at One Time
Partners in a Railroad
Enterprise.
CORONER'S INQUEST TO-MORROW
Dr. Bohm, a New Witness, Promises
to Give Some Very Important
Evidence.
The appearance of George A. Knight as
attorney for J. T. Flynn, the alleged
destroyer of his own child, recalls an in
stance of a few years ago in which both
figured with equal prominence as the
promoters of one of the most important
railroad deals ever undertaken on the Pa
cific Coast.
The plan included the extension of the
San Francisco and North Pacific Coast
Railroad from its present northern
terminus at Ukiah to Portland, Or., a
distance of about 550 miles. The inten
tion was to convert the Donahue road into
a trunk line to be known as the Pacific
Coast Terminal Railway Company. ,
Had the schedule gone through an inlet
would have been made into San Francisco
for the Great j Northern, the Union Pacific,
the Northern Pacific and the Canadian
Pacific railroads. The idea was the joint
product of Knight and Flynn; and was
only defeated by the untimely death of
Colonel Donahue.
; During a journey to Portland in 1890
Knight met Flynn, who was : then largely
interested in a Southern Oregon land en
terprise. A two hours' chat in a Pullman
smoker on their way north resulted in the
birth of the coast road scheme. Knight
was a personal friend of Colonel Donahue,
while - Flynn ; was interested in various
land- deals with W. H. Holcomb, vice
president of the Union Pacific, and C. H.
Prescott, holding a similiar position with
the Northern Pacific.
An V introduction ?to Donahue followed,
resulting in a tacit agreement on the part
of the northern roads to use the Donahue
terminal line into San Francisco. The
four roads. were to pay a combined track
age-rental equal 'to the interest on the
bonds issued for extension purposes. This
would have given each of the northern
lines an entrance into this City, at a cost
less than a sixth of that of "individual
ownership, and still left Donahue in pos
session of all the local business.
Arrangements were made at the same
time to take in the I Oregon Pacific system
and use it as a feeder for the terminal
also to 'construct v another L branch from
Eureka to the Upper Sacramento Valley
and; possibly another ..into the Rogue
River Valley from Crescent City.
* This system would have opened up"? a
vast territory along the coast between
Mendocino County and , the ? Oregon line,
besides making ; San : Francisco master of
the ccast business. Colonel Donahue laid
the question of a bond issue before a syn
dicate of Boston bankers and was assured
that they would be taken at par to the
extent of $30,000 per mile, or within $10,000
per ? mile V of ; the 5 estimated cost. ? Shortly
after A. the : receipt of - ? this ; intelligence
Knight, Flynn and Mr. Zook proceeded to
Ukiah on a (special 'train,' where they met
Colonel Donahue and- a* s party of Eastern
friends. As the result of this conference,
Colonel y Donahue ? started north with a
surveying * party, intending to ' go to the
Rogue River Valley by .way of < Eurek.\,
but the rough weather encountered made
it necessary to abandon the project at
Eureka and return by steamer to San
Francisco. A few weeks later Colonel
Donahue died, and the great coast railroad
scheme died with him.
In speaking of the matter â  yesterday,
Flynn said: "If Colonel Donahue had
lived San Francisco would now be the
great railway center of the coast, and Mr.
Knight and myself would be several hun
dred thousand dollars ahead."
W. G. C. Pitt of the Voice of Labor, who
was connected with Flynn in soliciting
aid for the maintenance of the Labor
Bureau previous to the arrest of the latter,
yesterday consented to make, a statement
regarding his knowledge of and his rela
tions with the accused previous to and at
the time of his arrest. Mr. Pitt wilt ap
pear as a witness before the Coroner's jury
to-morrow. fÃ^pl^^jy-.v?-.
The following is his statement as written
by himself:.. Â» â¢ * ' _."**â¢
The time has come for me to speak. I have
hesitated, but never refused to be placed on
record regarding my relations with Mr. Flynn.
I first met him in Seattle some twelve years
ago. He was then a prosperous real estate
dealer. .Two years ago 1 met him here and did
what I could to place him in communication
with such publications as mieht need his ser
vices. I recognized his ability, as did a num
ber of others, among them being the editor of
the Wave, W. H. Mills, M. McGlynn of the
Voice of Labor and others.
Since our reunion In this City he has been a
constant visitor to my home and we all felt
cheered by his presence.
Last March Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald
requested me to make a canvass of the busi
ness community for the purpose of raising
sufficient funds to tide over the Dureau until
the next session of the Legislature. Feeling
the responsibility ot the work, and knowing
Mr. Flynn's ability, I called him to my aid.
How well the work was done I must leave for
Mr. Fitzgerald to say.
During the canvass, which lasted fully sixty
days, I never saw Flynn under the influence
of liquor. His only sin, so fur as 1 noticed,
was his insatiable desire for Inch-priced
cigars. I responded, so far as possible, in the
way of advancing him money from time to
time, but at no time was . the amount greater
than $10. I did understand that he had a lads

name, and I, of course, had no right to insist
upon knowing it.
At no time did he ask me for money for any
specific purpose, except when his son arrived
from Oregon. On that occasion he said: "My
boy needs some clothing; can you help me
out ?", I replied that 1 would, and did. Those
are my relations and acquaintance with John
T. Flynn. and I may add by way of conclusion
that lam proud to call him friend. I am his
friend, and will not believe him guilty until
indisputable evidence is presented against
him. * William G. C. Pitt.
It was also learned yesterday that Dr. E.

knows regarding the case. To a Call man
he said:
"I have known ; Mrs. Shane for ; about
three years. I treated her at the time I
first know her for an ulcerated limb, from
which she ; had suffered ? for a long time
previously. I succeeded in curing her,
and was afterward called to prescribe for
her and her family at various times.
'"On the night of the 13th of this month

POLICE COURT COMEDIES
The Meeting-Place of Luckless
People in the Limbo of
the Law.
THE LADY AND THE LAWYER.
Interpreting Counsel's Flowing Diction.
Floored Under an Interrogation
Point.
There are more things in a morning ses
sion of the Police Court than was ever
thought of in ordinary, everyday philoso
phy, it is the general meeting-place at
the foot of the gradeâ the point where
people who have got to the -end of their
rope fetch up, and the fiounderings of the
unlucky ones in ' the limbo of the law are
pathos and bathos mixed and mingled.
Even the painful efforts of the be
leaguered court seeking to restrain the
sometimes too much industry of the prose
cution, or struggling to escape the pitfalls
and entanglement of defending attorneys,
are often ludicrous. . The muse of comedy
and the goddess of justice sitting in bank
might preside not unfittingly over' the
destinies of the Police Court. . .
After the foregoing preface several acts
from 'the serio-comic performances in
Judge Joachimsen's court yesterday morn
ing may be given : Â
One Duffy, in Judge Joachimsen's court,
and his running mate, Ellis, were charged
with attempting to rob an individual of
innocency and inebriety -of his slender
assets after a night among the "steams."
The Prosecuting Attorney had gently ex
tracted the victim's plaint for the edifica
tion of the court stenographer, and then
defendant's council * was turned loose at
him: :'.'"' .
"Upon your solemn oath, Mr. Schmidt,
will you state upon your personal, apart
from any conclusions \ you may have ar
rived at from hearsay, testimony just to
what plane of intoxication you had re
duced yourself previous to this assault l
mean alleged assault â on Natoma street
on the morning mentioned in the com
plaint, and how many 'drinksâ ?" cAyfi
There is no evidence ;; that ; . this would
have stopped before autumn * set ; in * if he
had not noticed \ that the Judge was en
gaged in an argument with a . brother at
torney regarding bail for another offender
and had probably forgotten all about the
cross-examination. However, it had taken
forty seconds to ask that much of the ques
tion and I that was so \ much? time saved,
and that is much when and where time
â  (expended) is everything.
;â (. The witness struggled a while with the
ponderous interrogation ; point and then
sank down in complete inanition.
"Were you not, Mr. Schmidt, more or
less in a startling state of . inebriety," re
turned counsel to the charge, "while in
the company of Mr. Duffy â  and -Mr. Ellis
that morning?'' '
,"- ; "Were you * drunk?" suddenly ; inter
preted his Honor, looking at the galloping
hands on the clock dial.
"No, sir!" y.-':-'"' ' ~- :c a-:A
'â a "I should prefer, may your Honor
please,', that the witness answer my ques
tion,"-said the attorney blandly.
A "All right â read the question â witness
answer it," ordered the Judge.
The witness answered "No, sir," again
and went on record as not being more or
less in a state Of inebrietyâ an equivocal
condition, truly.
After. Mr. Schmidt's weakness for in
toxicants had been fully established, and
the fact that his wealth had decreased to
one solitary silver dollar and the half of
another oneâ after Mr. Schmidt had told
how the strong fingers of Mr. Duffy had
compressed his windpipe and the slender
digits of Mr. Ellis . had sought the resting
place of that . dollar and its fractured
brotherâ another witness had identi
fied the Duffy-Ellis features as belonging
to the twin night prowlers he had seen
prospecting in the pockets of the unwise
Schmidt, the next case was called.
A woman charged with vagrancy was
cited to the bar. -The policeman testified
that during the hours of the night she was
doing everything except ornamenting
some domestic fireside, and at no time in
his recollection did she conduct herself in
a manner compatible with perfect de
corum. Her general conduct, he inti
mated, was not such as Third and Howard
streetsâ her neighborhoodâ could admire.
To this her attorney entered a specific
denial, and before bu had finished "the
lady" â he called her that, with emphasis
on both phonic divisions of the words
had a "ca-rac-ter" as pure as a dewdrop.
"Officer Tool"â policemen are officers
in police court etiquetteâ began the attor
ney for the people, "on your knowledge
what is this woman's occupation?"
"I object to that answer," interrupted
counsel, "on the ground that it tends to
injure defendant'sâ l mean on the ground
that the officer knows nothing definitely
about her occupation."
However, it. was shown that the lady
was not a very good "lady" notwithstand
ing the assertion of . the keeper of the
saloon, where with the assistance of a
piano, she drew beer values from the poc
kets of the visitors.
"She is honest and industrious," said
her counsel, "and poor," using that rich
and magic word, the powerful and final ar
gument of a forlorn cause. "She supports
two children andâ'' "And a big, broad
shouldered man named Anderson," said
his Honor. "I know the chap and have
his name already Â»for sentence. I would
rather have him here than this woman.
However, letter-pear-f'r-sentence-morrow
ruorn'n."
Another unfortunate wary of cash suf
fered "a lady friend"" to relieve him of $32
during a reception which she held in his
honor in a North Kearny-street cafe. So
briety brought him; a knowledge of his
bankruptcy and the bruises he had re
ceived in return for his eighty-two pieces
of silver, and he invoked the law. On the
stand "the lady's" attorney inquired
closely into his liberality in the bottle
opening line, and his ability to know noth
ing after a certain period in the progress of
his usual drinking bouts. 'To such ques
tions he returned haughty and indignant
answers, bringing upon himself frequent
severe admonitions of the court.
- Whatever resentment he may have
cherished against the woman, whose fasci
nations were his undoing, be transferred I
to the interogating lawyer. In his wrath- j
ful mind she was exonerated, and, even if I
she Â£ had "lifted" his : pocket,' her un- |
righteousness was ; quite absolved in view j
of the wicked presumptiousnesss of her !
attorney. -Instead of casting a stone at
her, he heaved a whole broadside of rocks i
at him, and would have sacrificed the j
cause had not the State of California taken
cognizance of "the lady's", apparent short
comings and sent her below to prepare in
sorrow and in tears for the Superior Court
on a charge of grand â  larceny. Then the
heavy wbeels of - justice rolled â :, on with
creak and groan, like a car of juggernaut,
over the reckless victims of their own
folly. â¢;â â -;â¢. .' .â -,--,â :/â  â -. . . ;â â  -

ON A TOUR OF THE STATE.
How Her Husband Bought Up the Car
Lines in Chicago and Built a
:â â  Great University. .
Among the arrivals at the Palace last
night was Mrs. Charles T. Yerkes of Chi
cago, wife of the famous millionaire whose
philanthropic work, including his munifi
cent bequests, have made him known
throughout the world.
Mrs. Yerkes is accompanied: by Mr. and
Mrs. *G. Momsen Taylor of Colorado
Springs, Colo. Tney are on a tour of the
leading resorts, and have been attending
the flower show at Santa Barbara and vis
iting other points of interest.
The career of Charles T. Yerkes has
scarcely a parallel in this country, where
immense fortunes are made in a brief
time. "-yy
After losing all he had a few years ago
in Pennsylvania he went to Chicago, and
by luckly speculations, the like of which
have probably never been equaled, he
bought up the various streetcar lines of
that city.
He also founded the great' Yerkes Uni
versity and caused to be built a powerful
telescope, the biggest known in the world.
The university with its endowments cost
millions. Visitors to the Chicago Exposi
tion will remember the monster telescope,
which was then on exhibition there. '
. Mr. Yerkes has recently completed a
magnificent mansion in New York, cost
ing, it is alleged, with its furnishings,'
several millions. He already had a pala
tial home in the Windy City. The enter
prises with which Mr. Yerkes is directly
and Indirectly identified are various, ana
he is credited with making great sums an
nually from all of them. His wealth is
quoted variously at from $20.000,000 . to
$30,000,000, and some enthusiastic persons
place it at even a higher figure.
Mrs. Yerkes and her friends will prob
ably be here for several days.
â '..** Green Stones in Favor.
Green stones are the fashion just now.
Ol these, of course, first comes the emer
ald, ? for green diamonds and green sap
phire? are too rare ana? small for modern
jewelry. Nothing can "equal a really fine
emerald dark, velvety and glossy
yet it is said that a flaw or fault almost
always lies in the stone, and an emerald
without a flaw is priceless. Next to emer
alds come peridots (the French name for
Indian chrysolite). ' These stones are par
ticularly soft, and they,* are difficult to cut
and polish. Peridots, when really fine in
size, depth and color, are lovely stones.
They are a clear, deep leaf-green, showing
almost yellow beside the blue tone of color
of the ; emerald. , Few peridots are now
brought into the market, and those sola
are usually old stones recut . and reset in
modern fashion.
Both emeralds and peridots are "step
cut," with a large broad table or center
space. The chrysoprase is pretty, but
lacks depth of coloring. The reason tha
emerald and ; peridot make lovely orna
ments is that they can be set round with
sparkling , diamonds to . show off their
lovely coloring, but ? pale : : stones, like th*
chrysoprase or beryl, have to be set plain
by themselves, as they will not bear . the
contrast. About twenty years ago a fash
ion came f in .of . setting peridots with en
amel and v surrounding them with pearls.
This fashion now seems to have returned.

In the above list will be" found
all but twenty-four of the 196 names
said to have been secured to a
petition requesting the trustees of the
First Congregational Church , to depose
the Rev. Dr. Charles Oliver Brown. The
missing names could not be obtained, but
the complete list will be filed with the
trustees either to-day or to-morrow. Yy v
In addition to this formidable list, the
opponents of Dr. Brown claim to have the.
pledges of 110 other members of the First
Church who will vote for the official de
capitation of Dr. Brown if the opportunity
is offered. If this be true, there seems
little likelihood of the unfrocked pastor
remaining any longer in charge of his
present position than an official vote can
be taken.
A committee of five. Deacons Hatch and
Barnard, Dr. J. T. McDonald, Dr. J. H.
"Warren and Mr. Simpson, has . the matter
in hand and will on Saturday request
Pastor Brown to announce from the pulpit
on Sunday a business meeting for the fol
lowing Wednesday night.
There are some who profess to think
that Brown will refuse, to make the an
nouncement, while others contend that he
will read anything which might be handed
him because of his confidence to defeat
any measure prejudicial to his interests.
The opponents of Brown believe that if
on a test vote he should be retained as
pastor Â of the church any dissatisfied
member could apply for a writ of injunc
tion, and further, that the courts would
sustain it. In any event if Brown should
attempt to preach j next Bundav week an
injunction will be asked for, the outcome
of which will no doubt be interesting.
In the meantime Deacon Morse is also
thinking of appealing to the courts. He
entertains a vague idea that the Bay Con
erence had no legal right to suspend his
riend Brown, whatever that gentleman's
errors of the flesh might have been.
."I am looking into the' matter," said
Deacon Morse yesterday, "and if there is
any possibility of getting a standing in
court the suit will be brought. Some of my
legal friends seem to think "that such a
suit could not be maintained, though there
are some who believe differently. In any
event I shall : sift the matter to the bot
tom in an attempt to give a minister of
the gospel the same recourse in common
law open to every other class of citizens."
Deacon Morse will endeavor to get satis
faction from Mrs. Cooper and others who
have opposed Dr. Brown, through the new
Cooper. Congregational Church. His dis
content arises over the fact that the
Cooper ' Church refused to accept the ad
vice of the council concerning the name of
the new church. The whole matter will
m laid before the* committee on creden
tials at the next meeting of the Bay Con
.<â  frice. .." :y

nsisted upon. The advice given dis
tinctly by the council was that the name
of no person should be used, in the organi
zation of that church. In spite of this the
church organized under the name of
Cooper and is now known as the Cooper
Church.
"Representation was also made by the
Rev. L. L. Wirt that the unusual' haste
displayed by the church for its organiza
tion was not intended at all for the pur
pose of having dele-gates in the Bay Con
ference to vote against Dr. Brown. The
question was distinctly asked, and the
question was based upon newspaper re
ports, whether such report had any foun
dation in fact, and the council was
solemnly assured by Mr. Wirt that that
had nothing whatever to do with it. The
Cooper Church would not appear there in
any unfriendly attitude toward Dr. Brown.
As a matter of fact the delegates did
appear there and were active in their op
position to Dr. Brown, so much so that it
seemed quite evident that that was un
doubtedly the object of the unusual haste
in the organization of that church.
"I also intend to bring before the cre
dential committee the attitude of the
First Church of Oakland toward the First
Church of San Francisco., By established
precedent in Congregational usage no per
son supplying a pulpit can take a place in
a council. It is generally understood that
Dr. S. M. Freeland is now, and has been
all the time, unfriendly to Dr. Brown.
Presumably this was known to the church,
and in order that Dr. Freeland might sit
on that council he was elected acting pas
tor. This would naturally be considered
an unfriendly act to a sister church, and it
seems to be of sufficient importance to de
mand a thorough investigation by the
committee on credentials, and the matter
will be properly presented to them."
The opponents of Brown will meet in
the Columbia building to-night, when a
final plan of action will be agreed on. It
is thought that many new names will be
added to the petition requesting the trus
tees to remove Dr. Brown.
About Encores.
Sims Reeves is hard on what he calls
the "vicious encore system." He char
terizes it as a preposterous piece of
dishonesty, of which all honest per
sons should be ashamed. The nuis
ance, he says rightly, seeks to take a
shabby advantage of the suffering pro
fessional; and it is to be regretted that few
of our performers possess sufficient courage
to return to the platform, bow politely and
indicate firmly No! Your encore-monger
cares nothing about symmetry or balance
or cohesiveness, whether the occasion be
the lyric stage, the oratorio performance,
the benefit and ordinary concert or the
ballad concert. yy.-A. v 3? \ i .-. i.-v**:?
He wants to hear more than he has bar
gained for, and if his demand is not yielded
to he will hoot and bray and hiss, when
an attempt is made to perform the next
piece, as if he ' belonged to the Jong
eared quadrupeds or feathered hi pen
tribed. And then we have occa
sionally what the newspapers terms
"a scene" an exhibition of - 'Arryism"
that disgraces our boasted civilization.
If managers, artists and the musical pub
lic would but think this matter over and
determine to stamp out the nuisance one
great blot on our English musical perform
ances might be effaced. Unfortunately, it
is not yet quite certain whether encores
are more distasteful to the great majority
of performers than they are to a large sec
tion of the concert-going publicâGentle

CARPENTERS TUG OF WAR
One of the Striking Features of
Their Picnic Next
Sunday.
POWERFUL TEAMS SELECTED.
Members of Unions 22 and 483 Who
Will Pull for a Purse and
Other Prizes.
The four carpenters' unions of this City
are preparing for a grand picnic and out-*
ing at Sunset Park next Sunday, and from
all indications it will be one of the largest
ever held by a labor organization in this
City. Not only will the wood-butchers
and their families attend, but hundreds
belonging to the unions affiliated with the
Building Trades Council, of which the
carpenters are a part. The committee of
arrangements have in store several sur
prises for the pleasure-seekers that will be
out of the ordinary picnic line. About 150
I merchandise prizes will be distributed at
\ the gate. It was suggested that there
| would be a cake-walk, but a second con
| sideration decided the committee upon
; prize-dancing instead and two beautiful
| medals have been prepared for the oest
: and most graceful lady and gentleman
l waltzers. ' Â-â â¢ --AyyA-. .?.-'." -v'-iv
One of the best attractions, and one that
I has been talked of in carpentering, circles
] for some time past, will be a tug-of-war
! between teams of nine picked from the
| powerful men of unions 22 and 483.
i The tug will take place in the pavilion on
j a cleated floor. The winning, team will
secure as a prize $50 in cash, a -cask of
| wine and several boxes of cigars. There
j has been considerable- friendly rivalry
| between these two Unions as to which has
| the largest and most powerful men. On
Sunday the men were selected, and are
now in training for the event. The per
sonnel of these teams shows that they are
composed of large, poweriul men.
The team from 483 will be captained by
R. B. Ingle. R. W. Smith, a native son
weighing 215 pounds and standing 6 feet .'5
inches, will be the anchor man. Louis

ENGLISH TABLE CUSTOMS.
Breakfast a Word Unknown Five Hun
dred Years Ago.
The old English had three meals a day,
of which the chief meal was taken when
the work of the day was finished. The
first meal was at 9, dinner was about 3
j and supper was taken before bedtime. The
j Normans dined at the old English break
! fast time, or a little later, and supped at 7
p. M. In Tudor times' the higher classes
I dined at 11 and supped at 5, but the
j merchants seldom took their meals before
il2 and 6 o'clock. ' '
The chief meals, dinner and supper,
were taken in the hall, both by the old
English and the Normans, for the parlor
did not come into use until the reign of
Elizabeth. Breakfast did not become a
regular meal â  until quite J lately nd Dr.
Murray in the Oxford dictionary gave 1643
as the date of the earliest quotation in
which the word occurred. The meal did
not become recognized until late in the
seventeenth century, for Pepys habitually
took bis draught of half a pint of Rhenish
wine or a dram of strong waters in place
of a morning meal. Dinner was always
the great meal' of the day and from the
accession of Henry IV to the death of
Queen Elizabeth the dinners were as sump
tuous and extravagant as* any of those
now served.
Carving was then a fine art. Each guest
brought his own knife and spoon, for the
small fork was not introduced into Eng
land until Thomas Coryate of Odcombe
published his "Crudities" in 1611. Pepys
took his spoon and fork with him to the
j Lord Mayor's feast in 1663. The absence
of forks Jed to muchlstress being laid upon
the act of washing the hands, both before
and after meals, and to the rule that the
left hand alone should be dipped into the
common dish, the right hand being occu
pied with the Knife.
The perfect dinner at the best time of
English cookery consisted of three courses,
each complete in itself, and terminated by
a subtlety or device, the whole being
rounded off with ypocras, after which the
guests retired into another room, where
pastry, sweetmeats and fruits were served
with the choicer wines. The English were
essentially meat eaters, and it was not un
til the time of the commonwealth that
! pudding attained its extraordinary popu
| larity ; indeed, the first mention of pud
ding in the mentis of : the "Buckfeast" at
St. .Bartholomew's Hospital did not occur
I until 1710, and In 1712 is an item of 5s for
I ice. â London Times.

TALE OF A HUSBAND'S CRUELTY
Wife and Mother for Twenty -Six
Years Prevented From Seeing 'â 
Her Children.
Mrs. Delia Beratta tells a pitiful tale of
marital woe and wrong, and if it is all
true she is certainly a very badly abused
woman and the attorney who deceived
her a very great rascal.
Mrs. Beratta prefaces her remarkable
story by the statement that she was mar
ried to Angelo Beratta over twenty-six
years ago and that until May of last year
they lived happily together and reared a
large family. â : Ay.
Now all her family has turned against
her, she says, and the $60,000 or $70,000
that she helped to amass as community
property is withheld from her entirely,
and she is turned out to die among strang
ers like an old horse that has outlived its
usefulness. >?V'?V'-'.;-y
"In the early part of May, 1895, my hus
band wanted to raise $1200 ready money
by placing a mortgage on a valuable piece
of property out on Clay street in the IGOO
block," she says. "I disapproved of the
measure and refused to sign the necessary
document.
"Then his inhuman cruelties began. 1
was turned , forcibly out of doors and left
to almost starve. My husband secured an
order of the court declaring me insane
and incompetent, and appointing himself
my ward. Then he secured the money
and had the order of court revoked.
"He drove me out of the house 'at the
point of a pistol. Later on I began suit
for divorce. s We lived at 1623 Clay street
then. I trusted my case to an attorney.
He deceived me. ' '
."Instead of prosecuting my suit for di
vorce, he worked with my husband and
secured my signature to* a paper that re
leased my husband from all responsibility
for my maintenance. Of course I had no
idea what the paper contained when I
signed it. Afterward I learned that, and
then the lawyer brutally told me that I
had no case against ray husband' and could
not sue. â¢ I was deceivedâ basely so.
"Since then up to the present timj I
have had to look out for myself as best I
could. I was also prevented from seeing
my children. As I said before, lam like
the old j farm horse turned out to die. I
have worked to help my husband amass
the $70,000 worth of property which he is
guarding so closely. \ I have been married
to him twenty-six years and raised nine
children. The oldest one, my daughter, is
24. Our baby, as we call , him, is 9. After
all these years of toil to help him in his
business and build up a happy home and
educate the children he has tried to turn
them against their own mother."
At this point in her story Mrs. Beratta
had a struggle with her tears. ';"-?>"â â¢.?
Continuing, she said: "Yes, he has
tried to turn the children against me and
has succeeded with the oldest, boy and
girl. Two weeks ago I went to the house
to see my baby, who, I had been told, was
sick. Mrs. Craft, with whom I am staying,
was s with me. We were refused admit
tance to the house" and my daughter in
sulted Mrs. Craft. It almost < broke my
heart. ...-.:?.' iH^-Jt* ASyAtA* â â¢-.
"Since Mr. Beratta learned that I in
tended to bring suit for maintenance
though, to be sure, he did not know then
that. l, intend also to sue for divorce in a
short timeâ he went to work at his trade.
This was done for a blind and also to aid
him, if possible, in his contest of my just
claims. We have lived handsomely on
our income, and for nine years he* has
never had any occasion to work. The
subterfuge is too palpable to have any
weight with an honest Judge.
"Before I was kicked from the house be
treated me in the most shameful manner.
One night when I was in bed, and feeling
badly, he came into my bedroom and
flourished a pistol in a threatening man
ner, and for a time I believed he really in
tended to shoot me. *
"The story is not nearly all told, and be
fore I succeed in getting my rights in the
courts I promise to show him up in his
true colors. This will prove all the blacker
by contrast with the fact that up to this
time last May, I should say â we had
always lived happily." . v ;â ; ; 'Â'
GOOD OLD EIVEB DAYS.
Captain Keardon'g Kxperienoe Kxtends
Over More Than Half a Century.
Captain J. E. Reardon of Shawneetown,
111., registered yesterday at the Moser, says
the St. Louis Globe. Democrat. The gen
tleman owns and commands the ' Jessie
Wilson, an Ohio River boat. His steam
boating oareer began more than sixty
years ago. "It was in 1835 that I made my
first trip down the Wabash in a keel boat,''
said the captain. "I was only 14 then,
and was cook of the boat. In those days
we used to float keelboats and flatboats
down the river and pull them back. A
crew generally consisted of twelve men.
and the cook and captain, as well as the
others, had to do a good deal of pulling
sometime,. A stake was driven in the
ground on the shore above the boat if there
was no tree near, and we pulled ourselves
up to it with ropes. . ,? 'â¢;.'
; "Before my day my father-in-law owned
twelve keelboats that ran from Pittsburg
to New Orleans,' and it took six months to
make a round trip. I worked on the Big
Wabash,* the little Wabash and the White
i River. Sometimes we used oxen in pulling
upstream. Nor was it such an easy matter
to go downstream. There weremilldams,
for example,' on â < the Little AVabash, at
Carmi and New Haven. If the water | was
very high we jumped them without? un.
loading, but tlie rule was to ; unload, carry
the freight below the dam and; jump the
dam with the empty boat, and then reload-
There were no railroads in those days, and
tne farmers of Illinois and Indiana had no
other way. of marketing their produce.
Many. of them built boats and floated them
to New Orleans loaded with .train, cattle,
hogs and vegetables. Deer meat, too, was
plentiful in those days. , 1 remember one
flatboat that was loaded with ninety tons
of freight, and just about half the entire
load consisted of venison hams." y
? Captain Reardon met Lincoln, Clay and
other prominent men before the war, some
of them frequently. "In the hard-cider
campaign of 1840 Lincoln came down to
our country, on horseback," said* the cap
tain. "He "was candidate for Elector on
the Whig ticket, and traveled with a man
named Lambert. I j heard him speak at
Shawneetown, New Haven and Carmi
Ihe meetings were held in log cabins, and
the hard cider and tho coon were always
there. Douglass I saw several times in
the fifties. Clay .was a frequent visitor at
Shawneetown, and Taylor I met there
also and at Louisville. Clay I first met in.
Louisiana. ;, He ": had a cotton ? plantation
down there and occasionally.visited it. On
one of these trips j the boat he was on, the
Andrew Jackson, stopped at Shawneetown
and the whole population went aboard to
greet | the g popular statesman: ; " Sam Mar
shall made a speech on behalf of the Shaw
neetowners, and Clay responded ; in a man
ner that made him ; still more population
that part of the country. When the time
for separating came he shook hands with a
good many and* kissed some of the girls.

Nearly all the old ladies of Shawneetown
to-day will tell you that Henry Clay kissed
them at that reception half a century ago.
* Joon A. Logan married in Shawneetown
"John did most of ; his courting at my
house." said Captain Reardon. "Miss
Cunningham lived near us and was gener
ally there when Logan came down from
Benton,' where he was reading law, to see
her. Bob Ingersoll spent four years about
town, 1 reading law. In those days Bob
had the most remarkable memory I ever
knew. After reading an article in a news
paper he could repeat it almost word for
word."
The captain is 75 years old and looks
good for ten years more of active steam
boating. He was born at Mount Vernon,
111., about eighty miles from St Louis.
He has owned several steamboats since the
war and made Ia â¢ good many â  trips to St.
Louis as well as to points on the Ohio and
Lower Misissippi. The boat he is now
running was named in honor of a daugh
ter of General Buford Wilson of Spring

TO MOOKWIN'S . SPEECHES.
The First One Made in Congress to Win
National Renown.
The first of his speeches to win National
renown was Corwin's reply to General
Crary, like himself a member of the
House. Crary was a bumptious general of
militia from Michigan, and in the course
of a speech on a bill giving Government
aid to the Cumberland road had taken oc
casion to attack the military record of
General Harrison, who had already been
nominated as the Whig candidate for the
Presidency. The defense of the hero of
Tippecanoe fell upon Mr. Corwin, and the
next day he took the floor and began a
speech which for delightful ridicule and
crushing satire . won him instantaneous
fame throughout the country. Compli
ments were showered upon the orator
from Iris associates in Congress and news
papers writers at the capital. John Bell
of Tennessee said he had never before
heard such a speech in Congress. John
Quinoy Adams referred to the vanquished
militia general as "the late Mr. Crary of
Michigan." ?.?? *y~' ;
But it was in his famous speech upon
; the Mexican war that he won his greatest
fame. That was not an humorous speech:
it was a classic. It was a magnificent
panegyric upon the blessings of peace and
the folly of a powerful nation going to war
with a weaker country for no other pur
pose than glory and aggrandizement. This
was a speech which not only won the
highest encomiums in this country, but
was copied abroad, wherever the English
language was printed, as a masterly ex
ample of human eloquence. It was in this
speech that the oft-quoted phrase is heard:
"Sir, if I were a Mexican I would* tell you.
'Have you no room in your own country
to bury your dead? If you come into
mine we will greet you with bloody hands
and welcome you to hospitable , graves.'"
But while this Mexican war speech in
the Senate rendered Corwin famous, he
made another at his home in Ohio defend
ing this speech in the Senate, in which he
is said to have surpassed himself. For the
reason, as stated above, that the art of
stenography was not in such general use
in those days, this last wonderful speech
was never preserved to history. From,,

MINISTER A. S. WILLIS
He Says There Is Almost a
Boom in the Hawaiian
Islands.
COFFEE LARGELY THE CAUSE.
The Minister Has Merely Come Back
for a Vacation, After Three
Years' Absence.
Hon. Albert S. Willis, United States
Minister to the Hawaiian Islands, arrived
here yesterday, on the steamer Alameda
from Honolulu, and is at the Occidental.
He is accompanied by Mrs. Willis and Al
bert S. Willis Jr.
"I am away merely on the regular sixty.
day vacation that the Government allows
once a year to its. representatives in the
consular service," said Mr. Willis. "I
have no thought of resigning, and the
auction sale of some of my goods would
have taken place anyway. lam not at all
in poor health. In fact I don't know
when I have been in such good physical
form, for I have increased materially in
weight.
"Though the Government allows a vaca
tion each year, this is the first one I have
taken in almost three years that I have
been at Honolulu. We are going to our
old home at Louisville, Ky., and will also
visit Chicago, Washington, D..C, I think,
and other places, beginning at Denver.
"There has been almost a regular boom
at Honolulu. During the last two or three
years many young men have gone down
there and engaged in coffee-growing. A
good many men there have also gone into
it and into sugar-growing. The third
year after planting, coffee matures, so that
things are looking well. - *â¢â  ' â¢"â¢ â¢â¢
"At Honolulu they have been erecting
schools, building roads and reservoirs and
putting up electric and pumping plants.
The city looks well and over the islands
where there is any settlement there is
thrift and prosperity. At the time of the
cholera scare, some months since at Hono
lulu, a census of the people was taken
there and reputed at 32,000.
"I think this is inside. My own opinion
is that there are 35,000. This will show
you how it is growing. Honolulu is
destined to be a great re-sort,
â¢ "I can't tell you anj'thing politically,
for that would, touch on my duty as a
foreign Minister, but with what I have
said you will get a good idea of how
things are there." , 'Â..
. Minister Willis and his family will be
here several days. Mrs. Willis unfortu
nately sprained her foot recently while
stepping into a boat and has not yet en
tirely recovered from the sprain.
There is a project to generate power in
Kern County, Cal., by the agency of water
falls, for transmission to Los Angeles, 180

The Stability of Lofty Buildings as'
Considered by the "Scientific
> American."
Another step in the construction of The
Call building has just been taken. It is
the letting of the contract for the cut-stone
work.
In accordance with his motto of protec

tion to home industry. Claus Spreckels
has persevered in his course of letting the
contract for the steelwork to Pacific Coast
manufacturers by contracting for the cut
stone work with John D. McGilvray, who'
will receive $154,710 when it is completed.
The most important specifications of the
agreement between 1 the contracting par
ties are as follows:
The stonework is to be carried on in
such a manner that it shall at no time be
more than three stories below the top of
the steel frame. By August 12 it must be
up to the fifth floor, by October 5 to the
thirteenth floor, and by December 13 com
pleted. In case of delay an indemnity of
$100 a day is to be paid by the contractor.
The payments are to be made as each
successive story is completed, equal to 75
per cent of the value of the workmanship
actually incorporated in such story. The
final payment will be made thirty-five
days after the completion of the contract.
There are two bondsâ a statutory bond
for $39,000 and an indemnity bond for
$20,000.
To a height of about nine feet the mate
rial used will be granite. Above that all
four sides are to be of Pioneer stone.
About the main entrance, however, the I
columns will be of white marble, out of
which will be carved a group of allegorical
figures of heroic size on each.
This Pioneer stone is a beautiful, light
colored material and the quarries from
which it is obtained are situated near the
boundary line of this Stat* and Oregon.
The stone is to be finished channeled.
A dim idea of the beauty of the building
when it nears a stage of completion may
be gathered from the accompanying illus
tration, showing the main entrance after
the cut-stone work will have been finished.
The appended article, entitled "Stabil
ity of Lofty "Buildings/ taken from* the
Scientific American of March 21, J . 1896,
proves conclusively that the lofty height
oi The Call building will in no wise inter
fere with its strength.
Although the exaggerated proportions of the
modern office building render it, architect
urally speaking, somewhat grotesque, there is
do doubt but that the steel skeleton system
upon which it is built provides all the neces
sary rigidity and strength. The vast areas of
towering wall. which these | buildings present
to the wind naturally raise the question of
their ability to withstand the accumulated
pressure which must result when they are ex
posed to a gale of any strength. '.*"â¢* â â¢**.â¢.*'
The ; vibration of lofty buildings has ever
been a favorite theme with those who write in
the field of engineering romance.
The party who, not so long ago, gravely as
sured the public that the lantern at the top of
the Eiffel Tower swept to and fro through an
arc of ten feet, in response to the fiercer gusts
of a storm, was shortly afterward followed by
anothsr writer, whose pen, more given to flu
ency than to : fact, wrote down the details of
the vibrations of a certnin well-known office
building, which were described as being: so se
vere as to stop the clock on any but the lowest
stories! Factory chimneys, church steeples,
lofty monuments and in fact every structure
that raises it head much higher than its fel
lows to the buffeting of the elements are lo
cally credited with feats of more or less impos
sible vibration.
That factory chimneys do sway to and fro in
a high wind, and that a poorly constructed
building will rock, can be proved by careful
Instrumental tests, and in extreme cases the
motion can, perhaps, be detected by the eye,
but the frequency and extent to which these
motions occur has been vastly exaggerated.
It would be natural to suppose that the elas
ticity of the steel framework ot a fireproof
building would aliow" of a certain amount of
"give" or spring under the severe bending
stresses to which it is subjected by the wind
pressure.
We have been favored with the result of an
instrumental test which was recently carried
out on the twenty-first floor of the American
Surety building, Broadway, New York, by the
engineer and superintendent of the building,
J.Turner, It was made during the height of
the heavy storm which prevailed during Jan
uary 4, when an official wind velocity of eighty
two miles per hour was registered in trie
neighboring station. The test failed to give
the slightest evidence of vibration, a result
which agrees with the testimony of the in
mates that in a gale the topmost floors are as
still as the first stories. The test was made
with transit and level, and though it was not
a test of the highest instrumental character
the result was remarkable, for both the plumb
bob and the bubble remained perfectly still,
even where the building was struck by the
heavier gusts of wind. â¢
We confess to some surprise at this practi
cally absolute rigidity; for the absence of any
building on the other side of Broadway, and
indeed on that part of the whole block which
lies immediately in front of the Surety build
ing, makes it certain that practically the full
height, from curb to coping, was exposed to
the shock of the storm.
Just how great was the bending strain set up
within the buildine is a matter of easy calcu
lation. The front exposed to the -wind is 84
feet 8 inches wide by 814 feet high, giving a
total of 26,585 square feet. The wind pressure
corresponding to 82 miles per hour Is some
what problematical, for, although experi
mentalists have discredited. Smeaton's for
mulse, they have given us no substitute upon
which they are well agreed among themselves.
Smeaton gives 31 pounds per square foot as
tne pressure corresponding to 80 miles per
hour. This is undoubtedly too high. Pro
fessor Martin's pressure â 0.004 V 2,
works out at about 25 pounds to the square
foot, which we will assume to have been maxi
mum pressure upon this occasion. â¢ â â -â â¢
This gives a pressure upon the whole front
of 332 tons, and a bending or overturning
moment, of over 52,000 , foot tons.-. These
figures give us an impressive idea of the solid
ity of a construction which proves to be en
tirely insensible to such powerful disturbing
forces. It must be due to the combination of
a thoroughly well-riveted steel structure with
the inertia and rigidity of massive walling
into which it is tied and built. t A â -â

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 24, 1896.
WILL SUPERVISE
THE EXAMINER
H. W. Hawley Is Now the
Publisher of That
Journal.
HE OWNS NO INTEREST.
A. M. Lawrence Has Been Ap
pointed to the Office of
News Editor.
OTHER CHANGES TO BE MADE.
F. L. H. Noble Wi 1 Assist Mr. Hawley
in the Editorial Management v y
for the Present.
The article in yesterday morning's Call
announcing that H. W. Hawley bad
assumed the management of the San Fran
cisco Examiner created a good deal of talk,
not only in newspaper row, but also in po-
litical and business circles. It came some
what in the nature of a surprise, for it had
been announced a few days previously that
A. M. Lawrence, one of the New York
Journal's writers, was to sit in the manag
ing editor's chair in the Examiner office.
This impression was left upon the public
mind because it was known that Managing
Editor E. H. Hamilton, who has achieved
much distinction as a graceful and classic
writer, was not satisfied with the weighty
responsibility and the "grinding drudgery
of his position, and sighed for ; tfye pleas
ures oi the soul which were to be found in
the theater lobbies 'and the clubs in the
companionship of intellectual men, few of
â¢coarse, but like diamonds, all the more
valuable because of their scarcity.
But upon Mr. Lawrence has fallen the
mantle of news editor, which, as its name
indicates, is about the most important po
sition on a newspaper. F. L. H. Noble,
one of the most scholarly pioneer editors
under the Hearst management, will assist
Mr. Hawley in the; editorial management
of the paper. His position has no name,
because the office of managing editor will
remain vacant for some time, Mr. Hearst
or Mr. Hawley, evidently having some
Eastern or Western man in the mind's eye
for that place. Â«: ,
Mr. Hawley's title will be that of pub
lisher. He will have the general manage
ment of the paper as a whole, embracing
both the business arid journalistic ends.
In other words, he will be Mr. 'Hearst's
resident representative, and will' not only
look after the editorials and the news, but
after the dollars that come and go through
the business office. .
Mr. Hawley said yesterday that he had
consented to accept the position of pub
lisher of the Examiner and hold it for a
year at least. yNo change would be made
in the business department' except that
Mr. Hawley would act for the proprietor.
For the present Mr. Hawley will concen
trate his attention on the editorial end of
the paper until he become- thoroughly fa
miliarized with its workings. *
? Mr. Hearst visited ? relatives in Santa
Clara ? yesterday and ; left for the East last
night with George Pancoast, his - private
secretary, and K. H. Hamilton. \; Mr. Ham-;
ilton .-. will spend a vacation of a few weeks
a-walkiug down Broadway and seeing the
sights of Gotham by invitation of Mr.
Hearst, and will be likely to attend tbe
various National conventions which will
meet this summer. On his return he will
write special articles for the Examiner.
"I have not a dollar's interest in the
Examiner," said Mr. Hawley yesterday.
"I would like to buy it, because I know it
to be a very remunerative property, ? but
Mr. Hearst will not sell a dollar's worth of
bis interest. He could not invest his
money to better advantage in any other
business, and besides that he has the sat
isfaction of being the proprietor of a jour
nal so influential as is thÂ» Examiner."
Notwithstanding Mr. Hawley's denial
that he has purchased "an interest in the
paper â¢ the opinion of newspaper men is
that such will be the fact in the near
future. Mr. Hawley is possessed of con
siderable means and has hitherto been a
newspaper-owner, and it is said by those
who know him intimately that he would
not work for a salary .
Mr. Hawley said yesterday that no fur
ther changes would be made at present,
but the air is thick with rumors of a gen
eral shake-up in the establishment.
FISHING WITH SET NETS.
Two Seizures Recently Made by a Dep
uty Fish Commissioner.
Deputy Fish Commissioner John Davis
writes to headquarters in this City from
Martinez of the work he is doing in the
upper bay. On the' 20th inst. he found a
set net anchored with pigiron in Honkers
Bay. He took it to Collinsville. At the
head of Suisun Bay a set net in four sec
tions, amounting ;. to 600 fathoms, was
found. It-was fastened with five anchors,
While taking it up J. Bergstrom appeared,
and claimed the net. . . .;;,? Ci . ,
This was better luck r than the deputy
expected, ana ho arrested the owner of
the net for violating the fi3h law. Berg
strom was taken to Benicia, and his case
is now before Justice Barry and a jury.
Davis reports that the spring run of sal
mon is exceedingly small, the fishermen
not averaging over three or four a day to
each boat. Bass, however, are plentiful,
but they bring a very small price.

KEITH GETS THE SECOND.
Emil Pissis Captures the . Third
Prizeâ The Rules of De
cision.
The committee appointed to award the
Phelan prizes, aggregating $1000, organized
Wednesday, and yesterday submitted the
following report:
San Francisco, April 23, 1896.
To the Directors of the San Francisco Art Asso
ciationâGentlemen: The committee appointed
to award the prizes offered by James D. Phelan
for certain historical pictures to be painted by
California artists has the honor to submit the
following report. The letter in which Mr. Phe
lan defines his offer is as follows:
* â¢';;? :y Novembkb 12, 1895.
To the Directors of the San Francisco Art Associa
tionâGentlemen: I hereby make j the following
proposition for the encouragement of local art and
historical research: I will -give.- the, association
91000 to In- used for the following purposes: Eight
hundred dollars to-be paid for the best picture
painted by a California artist, resident in the State,
representing one of these subjects: "The Discov
ery of the Pacific Ocean," by Balboa; "The Dis
covery of California," by Cabrillo: "The Discovery
of the Bay of San Francisco," by Portala. The
second choice Inthe competition shall receive $150
and the third *30. y H:-.-". '''""-.;â : ~- ,
The picture shall belong to the association and
all the competitive canvases shall be exhibited at
the next spring exhibition of the association, April,
1896, at which time the selections snail be made
by the judges.
. The judges shall be chosen as follows: Two art
ists by the competitors, two laymen by the di
rectors of the association and a fifth, who shall be
an artist.by the' four so chosen. The votes of three
of the judges, who shall act during the first week
of the said spring exhibition, shall be necessary for
a decision. The directors of the association shall
make all other rules not inconsistent with the fore
going. * ' : 'l X.; * : ' * J." D. Phklan.
In accordance therewith ? the board of direc
tors of the Art Association appointed as judges
the following laymen: F. 8. Samuels and Cap
tain Robert H. Fletcher. The- competitors
selected the following artists: Ernest Peixotto
and Douglas Tilden. These four gentlemen
chose from among the resident artists Bruce
Porter. â  ''y"~y*
Their organization being thus completed the
judges assembled at the art Institute April 22
at 4p. m., all being present. The meeting was
called to order by Captain Fletcher, who was
requested to act as chairman, and deliberation
ensued as to the best means of transacting the
business before it. .^y-A^yfyy-
After due deliberation it was decided that
Mr. Phelan's wishes as interpreted by .the
terms of his letter received is best promoted
by the consideration of these 'salient features,
in the works submitted:
Firstâ Historical valueâ i.e., the story-telling
quality of the picture; its* unmistakable por
trayal of the incident, nature chosen, so that
the history and motive of the scene should be
plainly apparent, a requirement which would
also include treatment of the peculiarities of
the local landscape, accuracy of details as re-
gards costume, race characteristics and other
points tending to make the picture vivid and
real in its presentation of an important epoch
in the history of California.
: Secondâ Technical ;â¢ excellenceâ i. c., color,
drawing, composition and those other techni
cal qualities which * should be found in a
picture representative of the local, art at this
period. * ;â  â¢ ~y. n
>â â  These two considerations, in -the opinion of
the judges, were of equal weight. â¢: â¢ :
Thirdâ Dramatic interestâ i. cve v the depicting'
by grouping, attitude or otherwise, the signifi
cance of the scene and the emotion; naturally
attending such a supreme moment. V - : .
-<' It was furthermore decided that the opinions
of the judges should be obtained by secret bal
lot./' * â :**â â¢ .'â¢ â -'-â â¢:
Four paintings had been submitted by the
following artists, viz.: William Keith, .A.' F.
Mathews, Emil Pissis and A. W. Best. â¢.Â« * '
These paintings having been * on : exhibition
since the opening of the spring exhibition
each of the judges had ample opportunity for'
viewing them, and each accordingly an
nounced that he had arrived at a decision and
was ready to proceed to vote. ...,":â  Â
The first ballot awarded the first prize of
$800 to A. F. Mathews' "Discovery of the Bay
of San Francisco." r y,

/ "Killing"â Walter J Again Scores
Very Easily.
TT . t _ . . .
Morses with an especial * fondness for
juicy going had a great 'day of it at the
track yesterday. The mild "April show
ers" poured down incessantly, making, the
course very splashy. Rain beating in their
faces proved very distasteful to the favor
ites; Frank Phillips* mud lark, 'Shield
Bearer, being the only pronounced first
choice to get home in front.
. Thoughts of damp feet, pneumonia and
big doctors' fees did not keep the attend
ance down, for it was quite up to the
average, and the betting was lively.
] One of those plunges, the foundation for
which is generally hidden in mystery, was
made on Fannie B,a starter in the four
furlong dash for maiden two-year-olds.
From 30 to 1 the odds against the filly were
hammered down to twos, and a feeling of
uneasiness ? pervaded the â¢ ring until the
race was decided. Fig Leaf, who opened
a 3 to 5 favorite and receded to 4 and 5 to
1, proved an easy winner, with Senator
Morgan finishing in the place in front of
Viking. The "good thing" exhibited some
speed the first part of the journey, but her

showing scarcely warranted the * wild
plunge. Viking, who finished third, was
the post favorite at 3to 2. V -.
The talent made a sad mistake in choos
ing the horse to carry the bulk of the coin
in the opening six-furlong run. Veva,
with H. Martin, was made a 7 to 5 choice,
and failed to finish among the first three.
Edgemount and Virgie A fought it out from
start to finish, the former getting the de
cision by a short head. * The winner went
to the post at odds of 6 to 1.
The next event, a five and a half furlong
selling dash, was also taken in a hard
drive. After showing out in front with the
outsider Lady Terror, the even-money
favorite Crawford shook the mare off, and
through the stretch looked a winner, but
the last forty yards was collared and beaten
out by Starling, the second choice, ridden
by Willie Flynn. Yreka finished a close
third. ...
The fourth race, a six furlongs under
selling conditions, : was about tne . most
open betting problem of the day. The
crowd was undecided between Tonino,
Perhaps and Heartsease, the general price
in the books around post time being _ to 1
and take your pick against any one of the
trio. Ike Johnson on Perhaps sent his
mount out in the lead when the field was
dispatched, and showing the way through
out passed the stand a length before
Tonino, who in a drive took the place from
Senator Bland by a neck. ; .
A seven-furlong run ? with four starters
again demonstrated what a vastly im
proved colt Walter J is. Starting an Bto 5
second choice he immediately went to the
front when , the barrier was raised aud
fairly rolled in, passing the judges with
his rider pulling him up. Five lengths
away Scimitar beat the 7 to 5 favorite out
nearly a length for the place.
;â¢ ; Shields on Shield Bearer was > a great
combination in the last race of the day
five and a half furlong spinâ and followers
of the favorite all .got aboard at odds of 7
to 10 to even up the day's losses. The re
sult was never in doubt,- for the favorite
was away first at the start and won as he
pleased, with the 20 to 1 shot, Last Chance,
finishing in the place.
Track and Paddock Items.
Old Jim R, the sprinter, was a starter in
the second race. It was his first appear
ance since he stepped on that beer bottle
in a Stockton ; sandiot nearly two years
ago. .
Paros has 'been touted as being a great
mid-runner. If he is the mud must have
been a trifle too damp for him yesterday.
Some horses are race connoisseurs in
that line.
. As the horses were on their way to the
post in the second race the judges in scan
ning the jockeys as they passed the stand
thought that Mike Bergen on the favorite,
Crawford, looked as though he had been
imbibing- a drop or two of red liquor.
Mike and his mount were called back to
the stand and the judges decided to sub
stitute Shields in his stead. The jockey
protested that he was in his normal condi
tion, but the officials ruled otherwise and
concluded that Mike was entitled to a rest
for the remainder of the meeting.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperatur-- for tbe
days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of
.rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during tbe past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hich" means high tarometric pressure and
ls usually accompanied by fair weaiher: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy w-eather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pres sure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a -high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather, may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK. N. Y\. April 23.â revival of
the Venezuelan war scare in London was promptly
reflected in a decline at the local Stock Exchange
of anywhere from V* to 1% per cent in prices. In
the decline Sugar and the Internationals were
most conspicuous. The selling for foreign ac
count played directly into the bands of the sold
out bulls and the latter attempted to force further
liquidations. ' They met with little success, bow
ever, as commission-nouses bought liberally at a
decline. As a result of this buying tbe Grangers,
Missouri Pacific, Michigan Central, Lake Shore,
Jersey Central and New York Central sold at the
best . figures attained since the current bull move
ment was Inaugurated.
In the last hour of business Tobacco suddenly
broke to 693,4. Early in the day the stock brought
74 V 5 . . The slump was due to an unconfirmed
run. that an Injunction had been obtained re
straining the payment of the scrip dividend re
cently declared. The break in the stock had but
little influence on the general, which held fairly
steady to the close. . Net changes show losses of
V-lSiVs per cent, Sugar leading. The Grangers,
however, snow slight gains for the day.' Tobacco
lost 4 percent. Total sides were 279,400 shares.
Bonds were unusually active and strong. The
transactions footed up $2,876,000. Colorado Mid

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, li__, April 23.â After some irregu
larity in the fluctuations this morning wheat be-,
came quite firm, shorts doing considerable buying.
There was not much pressure of the May options
on the market to-day as recently existed, and con
servative traders lean to the belief that the bulk of
the liquidation of that delivery by longs is over,
but that there remains some short property to be
bought in before it Is thoroughly evened up. The
Cincinnati Price Current was bullish in its sum
mary, the effect being felt at the start.' Prices
then declined on the rains but rallied very soon,
rising above yesterday's close. Liverpool cables
were V_d? lower. Receipts at Chicago were six
cars and 111,341 bushels were withdrawn from
store. Northwestern arrivals were 287 cars
against 297 last Thursday and 306 a year ago.
Export clearances were moderate at 269,190

than yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor

CORNâ Was steady In the main, but at the same
time was susceptible to the weakening or strength
ening of wheal. The Cincinnati Price Current
commented favorably on the outlook for the new
crop of this grain. Receipts were 278 cars, and
20,000 bushels were withdrawn from store. Liv
erpool cables were quiet and steaiy. Export
clearances amounted to 81,777 bushels. May

295/s@29V_c, closing at 295/ B e. 8 c higher than

OATSâ Were dull and steady. According to the
Cincinnati Price Current the prospects of the next
crop of oats are at present promising. This in
formation was without effect on the market. The
improvement, in wheat served to sustain prices.
Receipts were 201 cars and 22,194 bushels were
withdrawn from store. May oats closed unchanged
from yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow
230 cars.

PROVIsIO \ Sâ Not a great amount of business
was transacted in product, but the fee ing was
firm. The hog market paused in its declining
course and product coincided with It by remaining
steady. Some of the strength displayed was re
ceived from wheat. May pork and May ribs each
closed 5c higher and May lard a shade higher.
BUTTERâ There was a little more activity in
the butter market 10-day, but the feeling remained
easy. The receipts were liberal while the demand
was only moderate. Creameries, extras, l_V_c

CONDITIONS IMPROVING.
Cheerful Views of a Well-Known New
York Banker.
Henry Clews, the New York financial authority,
takes the following cheerful view of the future in
his last circular: > "A matter really Important, as
bearing on the ' gold movement, is the marked
change that has appeared in the drift of the for
eign exchanges. For each of the last three
months there has been an increase in our exports
of merchandise and a decrease in the imports.
The returns for March evidence a continuation of
this tendencyâ the exports showing a gain over,
last [ year of $10,000,000 and the imports a de
cline of $3,000,000. The imports of 1895 were ex
traordinary; first, because pending tariff legisla
tion had checked importations and exhausted
stocks in 1894 and. next, because the reduction
of duties naturally had lor its first effect the stim
ulation of imports and the oversuoplylng of the
markets throughout last year.
The import movement has thus been exposed
I to a sudden check; and 1; would not be surprising
if this year's receipts of foreign goods should fall
some $60,000,000 to $75,000,000 short of those of
1895. "The . condition of oversupply due to this
cause, as well as to an overproduction of most
kinds of domestic manufactures, has promoted a
decline in prices which is encouraging our export
trade; and the improvement in European trade is
fostering .a firmness in foreign prices which
makes It the easier to find outside markets in
t which we may dispose of our surplus stocks. This
: tendency not only helps to produce a wholesome
adjustment between our imports and exports, but
is also bringing about a gradual relief from the
congestion of merchandise stocks, which is the
main cause of the present partial depression of
business at the chief commercial center. There Is,
therefore, a rational ground of assurance that,
however unsatisfactory may be the present aspect
of some of the commercial markets, yet affairs are
working gradually toward a readjustment that
will establish a healthier and more active condi
tion of affairs.

WOOLâ local circular says: "The local market
Is, if possible, more demoralized than at any time
heretofore in the history of Pacinc Coast Wool.
Old-time dealers have lost all courage to operate
because there seems to be no bottom to the drop in
prices and because of the terrible dullness at all
principal American markets. A large share of last
year's Pacific Coast clip still remains unsold in the
bands of dealers -East and here, and Wools that
were considered very -cheap when bought in 1895
to-day look very dear, and large losses stare the
owners in the face. 'We have no local business to
report. It is true that an occasional parcel of
Wool is sold, but the business is so Insignificant
that It is not worth quoting. in the absence of lib
eral trade figures are nominal and will continue
so until such time as there is a general movement
in Wool." We quote Spring Nevada, 6tgl9c ty Ib;

Early French Flying-Machines.
Â«*~'A f French locksmith thought that . prac
tice s was the creat thing: and. fitted with
wings, he ? : jumped 'first j from a chair, and
afterward from fii window, and then from
.the roof of a small house. In the last ex
periment he sailed over a cottage roof, but
soon niter sold his wings to a peddler â and
probably, saved his town life. ;, Another
Frenchman, a | Marquis, tried to go by the
air route across the river Seine; but he
.was. not drowned, since a washerwoman's
.boat.hiippenud to be where he came down.

FRUIT CROPS ARE BADLY HURT

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, April 23. J
The rainstorm of to-day has done con
siderable damage to the fruit and vege
table crops that have been already partly
spoiled by late frosts.
A strong wind blew here this afternoon
and did considerable damage to trees. In
the vicinity of Franklin and Twenty-third
streets two large tanks were blown down
and caused great excitement. They were
situated at the back of the house at 1563
Franklin street.
The house is occupied by a family named
Belles back and about 6 o'clock they felt a
shaking up and heard a report that caused
them to think there had been a great ex
plosion. It was not an explosion, but the
falling at the same time of two immense
tanks each containing 5000 gallons of
water. The tanks were supported, by
heavy timbers, but they were at a high
situation and offered a big exposure to the
strong wind. Without warning the whole
mass came down and some of the pieces of
tank were blown fifty feet away. The sud
den gust shook the nouses in the neigh
borhood and must have been somewhat in
the nature of a miniature cyclone.
HAYWARDS, Cal., April 23.â re
cent heavy rain has added materially to
the damage already sustained by the fruit
and vegetable crops. Early beans and
potatoes are killed and the tomato vines
will have to be replanted. All varieties of
fruit with the exception of Bartlett pears
and apricots have been ruined, so far as i
the possibility of even an average crop is
concerned.
The heaviest damage perhaps is to the
cherries. Some growers declare that there
will be no crop at all, but it is certain that
there will not be more than one-third of
the average yield. The young fruit has
hardly yet started to form and under
usual circumstances it should be ready
for market in three or four weeks. Plums
will be a very light crop and prunes, being
later, will be a little better.
It is safe to say that the apricot crop
will be about three-quarters of an average
yield,* -some of the orchards being light
while others have required thinning.
Bartlett pears have set very thick and some
thinning must be done unless there is more
frost and rain which will destroy some of
the early fruit.
The currant crop will be an average yield,
although some of the late blossoms were
hurt by frost. Some of the orchardists
who neglected to sulphur their bushes
early in the season will have their crops
ruined with mildew, a blight which has
only affected currants in this vicinity dur
ing the past five years. Grain and hay
crops never looked better and large
yields are expected. Farmers will soon
commence cutting volunteer hay.
; At San Leandro the cherry crop from
present appearances is* ruined. The situa
tion depends upon almost immediate sun
shine.
AN EPISCOPAL WEDDING.
Miss May G. Pope and Augus
tine Rossier Marry at the
Church of the Advent.
Many Unique Decorations by. Hosts of
' Friends. at the Altar and the
Home.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.l
908 Broadway, April 23. J
* The Church of the Advent was decorated
by many loving hands to-night. Although
the numerous friends of Miss May G. Pope
were loth to see her wedded to one who
would take her from their midst, this fact
did not prevent them from exercising all
their ingenuity and generosity to make
tie scene of her wedding one that should
remain in her memory for life. The lovely
decorations, which might be said to fill the
church, were the last tribute that could
be paid to thsir friendship for "Mamie"
Pope.
The bride is the only daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. T. E. Pope of Hillcrest, High
land Park, senior warden of the Church
of the Advent, The groom was Charles
Augustine Rossier, a prominent business
man of San Diego. Despite the storm the
church was tilled with the friends of the
family from around the bay.
The sides of the church were hidden
from view with bamboo, ferns, palms and
smilax. The four windows on either side
were banked with roses and smilax. alter
nating white and pink. On either ride of
the center aisle were a row of St. Joseph
lilies graduated from three feet in height
in front to six feet in the rear. Each pew
had one lily, which was in a pot which
was hidden from view by the liberal use
of smilax.
The most elaborate decorations 'were
kept for the chancel. A beautiful rose
hedge inclosed the full vested choir. This
was made of white and pink roses and
smilax. .- ln the ' center at the foot of the
middle aisle were i ates surmounted by an
arch some fifteen feet in height and of the
game material. A large rope of oak leaves
was suspended across just over the heads
of the choir. Grouped about the sides
were wild thistles, fern palms, great banks
of magnificent wild ferns and other potted
greens.
While the guests were gathering Sig
moid Beel, accompanied by Mrs. V. Mar
shall Law on the organ, rendered "Wal
thers', Prieslied" (Wagner) on his violin.
The ushers strung streamers cf white rib
bons down the center aisles when all
were seated, and at a given signal the full
vested c oir of 40 voices entered the audi
torium from- the right of * the chancel to
Lohengrin's wedding march and marched
across in front of the chancel to the left of
the building, singing as they marched.
The march was * continued . down to the
door at the rear, where the bridal party
were met, and escorted it up the center
aisle.
The bridal party was led by the brides
maid, Miss Virginia "White. The maid of
honor was Miss Carolyne Hawxhurst of Liv
ermore, a cousin of the bride. They were
iiressed in white and pink, wearing Cecil
Bruner roses. The bride followed, walking
alone. She was becomingly attired in
white satin, trimmed with old point lace
and a long veil, fastened with a diamond
cluster, the groom's gift. She carried a
bunch of St. Joseph lilies and an ivory
prayer-book.
As the party came down the aisle Bishop
W. T. Nichols of San Francisco, Rev. V.
Marshall Law, the groom > and his best
man, George Brayton Cramer of Philadel
phia, came from the side room and met
them at the floral gates, where the be
trothal service was carried out. Mrs.
Law and Mr. Beel rendered a duet
during the service, after which the choir
sang while the Bishop and rector retired
to the altar, followed by the bride and
groom. At the inner chancel they knelt
on satin cushions â one white, the others
pink â during the prayer. Tha double
ring ceremony was carried out and then
the procession reformed and marched out.
The ushers were Lieutenant C. L. Bent,
U.S.A., of Benicia barracks, Harley J.
Armstrong of San Diego and Allen Polio k
of San Francisco. They wore boutonnieres
of lilies of the valley.
"Hillcrest," the family residence, was
magnificently decorated for the reception
which followed the ceremony. A banquet
was served after the reception. The bride's
table was arranged in the center of the
room, with tete-a-tete tables in the corners
and throughout the other rooms. Fully
150 guests were present. Some 250 pres
ents, including diamonds, gold and silver
services, cut glass and tapestry, were re
ceived from friends in all parts of the
country. _> â 
HIS WORK FAILED.
Robert McDonald Indicted for Tarn-
perlng; With a Jury in a
Lottery Case.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 23.â The Grand
Jury to-day returned an indictment against
Robert McDonald, a painter, for felony.
It is a case of embracery and may explain
why fewer juries have convicted in Chi
nese lottery cases in the past in the Police
Court.
McDonald is charged with having at
tempted to bribe O. M. Peck, a young man,
in the case of Ah Tuen, which was on
trial February 26. It is said he promised
to give Peck $5 if the jury disagreed and
$10 if it acquitted Tuen. However his
plan failed, for the Chinaman was con
victed and fined $500. Peck keeps a fruit
store on Seventh street, near Washington.
The police assisted in getting the evi
dence into shape to present to the Grand
Jury. _
ROOT AND GORDON INDICTED.
Will Have to Stand Trial for the Little
Case.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 23.â Grand
Jury impaneled Monday afternoon made
a partial report to-day, returning two in
dictments. One was against Root and
Gordon, the two gold-brick swindlers,
charging them with felony in the case of
Banker Stephen Little of Dixon. The
court fixed their bail at $5000 each.
Gordon has been in the County Jail for
several weeks, where he was committed by
Judge Wood on a similar charge in con
nection with the Farmer Hofstra case in
default of $10,000 bail. Root was at the
City Jail, where he has been since his
seven attempts to escape by the habeas
corpus route failed. He was turned over
to the Sheriff immediately, being taken to
the County Jail in the patrol wagon.
"HANDSOME" RILEY.
Arrest of the Man Who Gave Sensational
Evidence.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 23.â Henry Ri
ley, formerly known as "Handsome" Ri
ley, pleaded guilty to begging in the Police
Court here to-day. Riley is the young
tramp who swore before the Coroner's jury
in San Francisco that Butler Miller had
tried to induce him to go out to the Frank
lin place a few nights previous to the
tragedy, telling him that he would give
him a chance to make lots of money.
Riley, in speaking of the matter to-day,
said he really believed that had he gone as
Miller directed he would have been killed
instead of the supposed burglar. At one
time Riley was quite a respectable fellow,
but he has given up work._ He will be
sentenced to-morrow.
Baumgarten Sued.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 23. â Sarah
Baumgarten has brought suit for divorce
from Solomon Baumgarten on" the ground
of cruelty. She asks for a division of the
property, custody of the minor child, and
to resume her maiden name of Widing.
The defendent was recently arrested, con
victed and fined $100 for shamefully
neglecting his wife when the babe was
born. At first he swore he would rot in
prison before he would pay it, but after
four days in jail relented and paid $96.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 24, 1896.
WILL CHRISTEN THE CUP
The Reorganized Board of Trade
Has Much Work
Before It.
PERMANENT EXHIBIT WANTED.
Several Bodies Working for Commer.
cial Prosperity Will Proba
bly Consolidate.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 23. ,
Attempts are now being made to bring
about a consolidation of the reorganized
Board of Trade, the Oakland Exposition
(a corporation) and the Ladies' Home In
dustry Club, which is a branch of the
Manufacturers' Association. Craigie
Sharpe, the superintendent of the last ex-
position and the moving spirit in the "new
Board of Trade, has made the discovery
that Oakland is the . largest city in Cali
fornia that has not a permanent exhibit of
home manufactured goods and products,
and the ladies of Oakland have announced
their determination to have one. The ex
position was a sample of what the ladies
can accomplish, and it is safe to say that
they will, in the near future, make a suc
cess of that which the merchants have
neglected so long. 'Ay^i
The large annex to the Tabernacla is the
property of the Oakland Exposition and in
addition there is about $2000 in money,
the profit of the exposition.
The Board of Trade has its archives and
the big silver cup which was won by Ala
meda in the county voting contest at the
Midwinter Fair. The cup has not yet
been filled -with punch, but it will be
before long. It was accepted by President
Keller on behalf of the Board of Trade,
and has been in that gentleman's care ever
since. ?^V : AAA-'
When the new board starts on its career
of progress with new life the big silver
bowl with the little bears dancing all
around it will cut a prominent figure, at
the inaugural banquet, which will be ar
ranged after the new board of directors is
elected next weeK.
Mrs. N. O. Trowbridge has some very
pronounced ideas on the necessity for en
couraging home industry. Some" months
ago she started the movement which pro
duced the exposition. Since then she has
secured the gratifying information that
several dealers in California products are
selling more home-made goods than ever
before. Mrs. Trowbridge was the energetic
head of the executive committee of the
exposition, and to her was due, in a great
degree, the success of that affair. Her
present idea is to rent a large hall and
stock it with exhibits of home manufac
turers. There will 'be a meeting soon of
the Ladies' Home Industry Club, which
may become an auxiliary to the Board of
Trade, and by constant campaigning the
ladies hope to be of material benefit to the
State. --.;"â  -.;-
Should the Board of Trade and the Oak
land Exposition consolidate it would form
a powerful organization, and the question
of owning a large hall containing a perma
nent exhibit would soon be settled. It
will be of such a nature as to accommo
date flower shows, dog shows, poultry
shows and art exhibitions, and also for the
annual exposition, which will be held in
future in October instead of December.
The annual meeting of the Board of
Trade is set for next Tuesday night, and
when the new board takes office the plan
of consolidation will be taken up.
FRESHMEN VANQUISHED.
Berkeley Sophomores Outdo the
'99 Men in the "Bourdon
and Minto" Rush.
The Flower Show Postponed on Ac
count of the Weatherâ A
New Church.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 23â the
first time in the history of "Bourdon
rushes" at the State University the sopho
mores spoiled the freshmen's fun this
afternoon after a fierce struggle by hauling
off their coffin-bearing wagon 'and all its
paraphernalia and fireworks.
A rush is consequent every year upon
the attempt of the freshmen to bury their
"Bourdon and Minto," and the termina
tion of the struggle is usually a victory for
the first-year men on account of the larger
number of fighting men they are supposed
to have, but this year the course of ? events
was changed. The sophomores simply or
ganized and duplicated the victory gained
over the freshmen last fall.
The '99 men have been clandestinely
preparing for their spectacular celebra
tion and triumphal march through the
j streets , to the campus for the past ten
days, and last night they sent out invita
tions bordered in deep mourning to their
sophomore rivals, and at the same time
brought out their speech-wagon from Oak
land. About twenty-five of them guarded
the wagon on its way from Oakland, walk
ing all the way, a distance 'of six miles.
Tliey. arrived at their y rendezvous in
Berkeley in the early hours of the morn
ing and j kept vigil until; daybreak, when
their guard was re-enforced.
Six sophomores were captured and bound
with rope in Oakland before the tramp to
Berkeley was . commenced. "A. Five of them
escaped through strategy, and the other
was released, on. parole. At noon to-day
about thirty freshmen were encamped at
their headquarters on Blake â  street; near
Telegraph avenue, which consisted of a
deserted barn, and were furnished dainty
sandwicnes \ for luncheon from the hands
of the co-eds of their class. Â« :
The sophomores, on account of the un
tim el v. notice: given them of the proposed
burial of the "math dig" and the English
book, were not altogether ready for hos
tilities, but gathering together a party of
about fifty they stormed 4 the old : barn and
brought out the swarm of freshmen, who
were armed with pieces of hose pipe, clubs
and rope.
Apifitfg up of struggling students and
the besmearing of grimy mud ensued, f
The two classes "rushed" for two hours,
when finally t..e freshmen gave up and
permitted the sophs to burn the coffin and
haul off the dray with its lightly built
speaker's platform.
A triumphal march was . then begun
through the streets, with a few straggling
freshmen coming up to the rear. The fifty
sophs and twice as many more upper class
men moved in the, processional line
through several of the principal 'streets,
all the time emitting loud yells of victory,
and then turned into the university
grounds. After hauling the wagon around
the main buildings, they took it into the
central part of town, where, beneath a
shower of driving rain, they were photo
graph, d in their tattered and besmeared
garments.
The freshmen went home without any
Bourdon, but with the satisfaction of
knowing that they made a hard fight.
Sabbath Association.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 23.â A meet
ing was held this evening in the First
Congregational Church, under the ' aus
pices of the State Sabbath Association, to
agitate for better Sabbath observance. An
auxiliary society, under the State associa
tion, will probably be formed in Berkeley.
Fiower Show Postponed.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 23. â The
flower show that was to have been held
to-morrow and Saturday in Shattuck Hall
has been postponed indefinitely on ac
count of the wet weather. The show will
be held at a future date, when the weather
is favorable. r

BERKELEY, Cal., April 23â new
$20,000 Presbyterian church building
which has just been completed at the cor
ner of Ellsworth street and Allston way
will be dedicated on the first Sunday in

BERKELEY, Cal., April 23.â John

CITY FINANCES.
There Will Be a Large Deficit, Even
With Only Regular Expenses.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 23.â City Aud
itor Snow will present a report of the city
finances to the Finance Committee of the
Council showing that unless some of the
regular expenses are cut off, such as street
lights and street-sprinkling, there will be
a deficit of over $22,000 at the end of the
fiscal year, June 30. In speaking of the
matter Mr. Snow says:
"The report simply shows what we have
known all alongâ that the dollar-tax rate
was not sufficient to run the city properly.
If the Council see fit to cut off certain ex
penditures we may tide over the year, but
I believe I shall have to discontinue draw
ing warrants after June 1.
Mayor Davie has published a letter re
garding municipal expenditures, in which
he says: . "â _ - Â
It is a well-known fact that a majority of the
officials of the city are not in sympathy with
the dollar rate, or will they ever be so, as I am
thoroughly convinced that they are not after
an economical government. It ls evident That
since its adoption a majority of the City Coun
cil has done all possible in its power to defeat
the popularity of the measure. They have ex
pended the city's funds regardless of conse
quences. "*â¢ y *.y:.:.i
By the adoption of the dollar limit tax rate
sufficient funds were provided to conduct our
city government on a basis far in excess of
cities of eqnal and greater^ population else
where. All departments were well provided
for and certain improvements contemplated.
The estimates upon which the tax levy was
based provided in detail for what purposes the
funds were to be expended. Some of the de
partments have not only expended the lands
as provided, but have gone beyond* the limit
'allowed or implied by law and expended sums
of money for purposes foreign to the matters
proposed.

Singular Failure to Recognize a Well-

OAKLAND, Cal., April 23.â body
of a young man found in the estuary on
March 22 laid at the Morgue several days
and was finally buried at Mountain View
Cemetery on the 26th unidentified. Henry
McGovern disappeared from home on
March 15, but it was not until a week after
the body was buried before the mother of
the missing boy began to connect him
with the tragedy. *
Mrs. McGovern and her daughter had the
stranger's body exhumed last Monday at
the potter's field and at once recognized it
as McGovern by the features and clothing.
The young man was well known and the
remains were viewed by hundreds, and ail
as well as the officers failed to recognize
him. *â â¢

money with which the faithless husband
is enabled to carry out his plans. In
Judge Cliffs court this morning a little
transaction was conducted that revealed
the whole trouble. Miss Lynde decided to
mortgage her property on Fifth street, but
was prevented from doing so by reason of
a $50 attachment. Price settled this in
Judge Cliff s court this 7 morning and $600
was raised on the property. From, re
marks that they dropped it was learned
that they intended to leave the State at
once.
Mrs. Price very reluctantly told her
story this evening. "I have no idea of
what led my husband to act as. he has
done," she said. "I have always treated
him well and he said that he has never
had any reason to complain. Ido not
know the woman with whom he has gone
and I think he must really be out of his
head to act as he has done. I have been
all that a wife should be for ten years, and
till a short time ago we lived in happi
ness. Then I began to see tbat things
were not as they used to be and lately it
all came out. '
"I'll never have anything to do with
him again. I hope he will keep away
from me and the children. I don't ever
want to see him again."
Mrs. Leach, the mother of the deserted
wife, says that Price long since ceased to
deserve the respect of anybody.
"He is dishonorable from start to finish,"
said Mrs. Leach. "I have supported him
for ten years, and during that time he has
not brought in one cent toward the sun
port of his family. A few days ago he
came home and even told the servants
that he was going to elope with the other
woman. He: went away at . Easter, while
his wife and child were sick in bed, and
when we told him he should not leave, he
said, 'I am going to a French, dinner, and
would not stop if a bombshell were in my
way.' "
Ten years ago Birdie Leach, then 17
years of age, met Arthur Price. They fell
in love; were forbidden to keep company,
and so they eloped. The girl's parents re
ceived her back to their affection, but to
the day of his death Mr. Leach never
recognized his son-in-law. Price tried sev
eral business ventures, but they all failed.
Once his mother-in-law set him up in
business, but he again met with bad luck.
Price, with his wife and children, lived in
the Pullman House, at West Oakland.
This is conducted by ' Mrs. Leach, his
mother-in-law, and she gave him a part of
the management. When it failed to pay
some investigations wore made, and much
of Price's doings were made public. A
few days ago Price openly announced to
his friends that he was about to skip out
with Miss Lynde. According to his wife's
story he has gone, and the shock has
seriously affected her. Miss Lynde lived
with her brother on Fifth street and is
one of the Handsomest blondes in town.
Mrs. Price says she will not sue for a di
vorce, as it would be altogether too agree
able to her husband.
Fred Lynde, a lad 19 years of age, visited
the Pullman House at 2 o'clock this morn
ing hunting for his sister, who did not re
turn home last night. He did not find her,
and threatened to make it warm for Price
when they met. This morning, Price and
young Lynde effected a compromise so
that the mortgage could be made and the
money raised on which to elope.
Mrs. Leach said to-night that Price had
taken a rig of hers and had sold it, and
I also hinted that Price had. been laying by
money for some time in preparation for
this trip. She says he was not as poor as
he evidently made Miss Lynde believe.
Ten years } ago Birdie Price was a very
attractive young woman. Now she pre
sents the appearance of a woman of 40.
As . she told her story, with ; the help of
her mother, it : was pitiable . to ! note the
mental suffering she was enduring.
The barefaced manner in which her hus
band made preparations for his departure
seems to trouble her more. than the fact
that he has deserted her. Her father was
a well-known First . Ward politician and
for a time was Deputy Assessor^
Price originally came from a good fam
ily, but he was totally without ? ambition
and was contented to hang around bis
mother-in-law's ; house and do nothing. ''
By many of the neighbors his boasting
was regarded as idle talk, but now that
they see he was in earnest it will not be
well for him to < make his ' appearance at
his old haunts. Â
After leaving Judge Cliffs office Price
and his second love left Oakland, and it is
supposed they are now out of the State.

" * * * It was held that a mail train was
composed not only of postal cars, but of
such other cars as were usually drawn with
the postal cars in the same train ; that the
railroad companies could not be required
to run mailcars, when prevented by vio
lence from hauling with them other
coaches assigned to the train; and
that any cutting out of cars from a mail
train was an interference with the trans
portation of the United States mails. So
it was held that the stoppage of
trains â freight or passenger â running
from one State into another â that is,
conducting interstate commerce or the
tearing up of or obstructing the tracks
over which such interstate commerce was
carried, was an offense against the peace
of the United States. Such an offense may
be enjoined by the courts, and the army of
the United States used by the President
to restore order without waiting for any
call from the State Legislature or the
Governor for assistance, It is not 'domes
tic violence,' in the sense of section 4,
article IV, of the constitution, but an at
tack upon the powers of the National
Government, and neither the request nor
the consent of the State is needed to give
the President a right to use the means
laced in his hands by the constitution to
preserve the peace of the United States
and to see that the mails and interstate
commerce are not stopped or impeded by
violence. A strike of violence affecting a
street railway in a city, or a shop or fac
tory, or coal mine, or other local interest,
or a riot raised for the lynching of a pris
oner charged with an offense against the
Stateâ these must be dealt with by the
State authorities, save that, as has been
seen, the President may be called upon for
aid by the Legislature or Governor."
UNITARIAN CONFERENCE.
Women Decide to Remain Dis
tinct From Male Organ
izations.
The Latest Regarding Company G
Troublesâ Masons' Reception a
Success.
I ALAMEDA, Cal., April 23.â This morn
was set apart for the meeting of the
Women's Unitarian Confernce in connec
tion with the Pacific Unitarian Confer
ence, at present holding its session. In
spite of the downpour of rain fully 150
ladies were in attendance, Rev. Mrs. E. T.
Wilkes occupying the chair. The secre
tary, Mrs. W. H. Baurhyte, read the an
nual report, outlining the work . accom
plished during the past year by the women
of the church* Mention was also made of
the inability of the A. U. A. to further
subsidize missionary work.
The branch reports showed the Alameda
one to be in a flourishing condition, with
63 active members and meetings well at
tended. From Berkeley, with a member
ship of 65, through Miss Davis, an equally
satisfactory report was received. Los An
geles, with 67 members; Oakland, with 60,
and Portland, with 60, also sent in encour
aging statements. Miss Ellen Vanden
borg gave' a glowing account of the work
done by the Women's Christian Work
Union of San Francisco, with a member
ship of 119. From San Jose, through Mrs.
A. E. Clark, and Santa Maria, through
Mrs. Mary Weaver, similar reports were
received.
Miss Snook, Miss Easton and Mrs. M.
Devoux also rendered similar accounts of
Postoffice mission work in San Francisco,
Portland and Seattle. A telegram from
National Association headquarters, Bos
ton, was received tendering its good
wishes and greetings. '
j Rev. Mrs. Wilkes gave an account of her
missionary work in Palo Alto, Haywards,
Woodland, Vacaville and other interior
settlements. Good work had been done
and great encouragement given her not
only by the strangers she had visited, but
by the various women's branches of the
National Association. AA'y^&ifg:.
Miss Easton spoke of the idea of the
women's and men's conferences uniting in
future to transact business. It was accord
ingly moved that such action be taken,
but on a point of order beins raised it was
decided to lay the matter on the table.
Mrs. Soule of Alameda wanted to know
on behalf of herself and many others of
'our relations to the National Alliance."
She wished information as to whether
women were eligible to join the union, if
benefits of the union were mutual and
whether the various societies' interests
were not too much centralized in the East.
Miss Easton undertook to reply, and
shortly covered the ground in a comprehen
sive speech, wine how the whole branch
of women's work sprang eight years ago
from the A. '.'â  U. A. and the Rev. r Mr.
Wendte's labors ; that the benefits were
mutual and the centralization nothing
more than a valuable bureau of statistics
and information. Mrs. Tolles, a visitor
from New York and a member, spoke of
the good work accomplished by these
branches and hoped the action would
goon. ..'"..'
The following officers were elected for
the ensuing year: President, "- Rev. Mrs.
E. T. Wilkes; vice-presidents, Miss
Easton, Mrs. T. L. Eliot, Mrs. Acton; re
cording secretary, Mrs. W. H. Baurhyte;
corresponding : secretary, Mrs. *W. S.
Wattles ; treasurer, Mrs. A. G. Freeman.
As directors, the following were â¢ chosen:
Mrs. E. O. Smith, Mrs. Horace Davis, for
California; Mrs. 8. W. Tilton, Mrs.
Knowles, for Oregon: Mrs. Thomas Slade
and Miss Eveline Ayres for Washington.
In the afternoon "How to Deal With Uni
tarian Churches in Smaller Towns" was
dilated upon by Mrs. Sarah Pratt Carr,
Leemore, Cal., and a paper read by Pro
fessor E. A. Ross, Stanford University, en
titled "The Mission of the Church From

VALUABLE MANUSCRIPTS.
The Astor Library Has 8200,000 Worth
of Them in Its Possession. ? -.,
There are $200,000 worth of ancient man
uscripts in the Astor Library, but the old
est of these is the Evangelisterium, which
is said to have been expressly executed for
Charles the Bald, the grandson of Charle
magne. He was a patron of the fine arts,
and was especially fond of embellished
manuscripts. This rare and precious man
uscript, which few people are aware is pos
sessed by our city, is written on fine vel
lum and* is an oblong quarto of 400
pages. The first four pages have splendid
full-length miniatures of the four Evan
gelists, profusely illuminated with liquid
gold and emerald green, shaded with red
and white on an empurpled ground, the
pictures covering the entire page.
St. Matthew is represented as a beardless
youth inclined to a lecturn, upon which
there is a book with the first words of his
gospel inscribed on it. St. Mark is repre
sented as bearded and sitting upright on
a throne, holding in his left hand a closed
book with the first words of his gospel in
scribed its back. . On the third page is the
picture of St. Luke, looking more aged
than his companions. He is shown with
an inkhorn in one hand writing his gos
pel. St. John is shown on a throne hold
ing an open scroll in his hand, upon
which : many words are discernible.
The gfth page of this volume con
tains the emblems of the four
Evangelists, viz. : the four living creatures
that the Prophet Ezekiei beheld in a vision
surrounding the throne of God. Matthew
has for his symbol a creature with a
human head, Mark the lion bead, John
the eagle, while Lute is represented by
the winded null-headed figure. The ninth
page is a magnificent specimen of inter
laced capitals peculiar to manuscripts of
the Carlovingian era. This highly illum
inated sheet forms the title page of the
book. It has only fifteen letters, but a
closer examination reveals the marks for
hidden letters. The words are "Legendum
per Anni Curriculum."
One page of this precious volume is
equally emblazoned with brilliant gold
and colors and has the Dominus in
scribed on it. There are several other
Dages equally embellished with multiplied
interlacing and leafy shadowings. The
services for the principal festivals are mar
velously executed and the seventeen pages
for Easter are magnificent. I can give no
adequate description of this precious relic
of the ancient art now in New York. A
comparison with modern specimens shows
that we have but little advanced over the
monk artists of the ninth century. Dr.
Frederick Sanders, the . venerable libra
rian of the Astor Library, justly calls this
manuscript an "unrivaled beauty."
This superb manuscript was secured
some fifteen years . ago by the late Mr.
Astor from the famous London biblio
phile, Bernard Quartrich, who catalogued
it in 1880 at $5000. There are more costly
manuscripts in the Astor library for in
stance the Antiphonaise of Charles X, for
which I am assured the late J. J. Astor
paid $10,000. But this old manuscript of
Charles the Bald has, as an antique, no
rival. New York World.
McKlnloy and Allison.
A correspondent of the Chicago Times-
Herald makes out a relationship between
McKinley and -Allison. "Governor Mc-
Kinley's mother," he says, "was Nancy
Campbell Allison. ' The Allisons came
originally from Great Britain, and had
first settled in Virginia. . This branch of
the family migrated to Green County,
Pennsylvania, where was born " Abner
Allison, the grandfather of William Mc-
Kinley Sr. Abner married Ann Campbell,
of a Scotch-German family, and early in
this century migrated from Pennsylvania
to Columbiana County, Ohio, Mrs. Allison
riding the whole distance on horseback,
holding in front of her on the horse her
youngest child. They settled on a farm
near New Lisbon, and there was born, in
1809, Nancy Allison, who married William
McKinley Sr. *in 1829, and who is the
mother of Governor McKinley. She is
still living in good health at Canton, and
is a most lovable old lady. Many of her
friends who know Senator Allison have
noted, what they regard as a family "re
semblance between them. Senator Alli
son said to-day he had often been asked if
Nancy Allison McKinley was of his fam
ily, and while he had never been able to
determine just what the relationship was,
he had no douDt they were kin. The Sen
ator said his own immediate branch of the
Allison family, were from County Mona
ghan, Ireland, and were Scotch-Irish."

NEW PAVILION
NEAR THE PARK
A Picturesque Theater to
Be Built This Sum
mer.
IN THE SPANISH STYLE.
Will Be Opened on July I and
Be Known as " Chutes
Orpheum."
PART OF A NEW ENTERPRISE.
Designs Show Quaint Piazzas and
Moorish â Seating Capa
city for Crowds.
Among the important improvements
contemplated for erection in San Francisco
this summer is a handsome pavilion thea
ter at the Haight street recreation ground.
This place of amusement is intended to be
a commodious and quite artistic struc
ture, in which high-class variety enter
tainments will be given. It is to be con
structed under a contract expressly for
Gustav Walter of the Orpheum, and will
be known as the "Chutes Orpheum."
The designs and plans have all been
completed and accepted. The architects
design was successful in a competition
were Knoth & Behrnd.
The tbeater will contain seats for 2500
persons on tbe inside and 500 more on
the novel piazza outside. Tables will be
arranged throughout, with four chairs to
each, over the spacious floors. The facade
has been designed in the Spanish style,
modernized to meet present requirements.
It presents a large gable in the center,
decorated with Moresque frescoes, and
at the sides ornamental towers with
quaint domes. So much standing in
relief from the main front wall gives a
picturesque appearance to the theater. A
semi-circular elevated porch, having four
terraces, extends far out in front, and the
great windows will be so arranged that
they may be dropped into pits and thus
allow people on the outside to enjoy the
performance on the stage or pass in and
out of the theater. At the hrst story will
be an oval veranda for a bandstand.
On two sides of the large interior there
will be neat loggia boxes elevated above
the floor to permit of a good view of
tbe stage. At the end opposite the stage
there will be a large bar cut off from the
auditorium and equipped with lavatories.
There will be a kitchen on the ground
floor capable of supplying fhe large crowds
that are expected to patronize the house.
The walls and ceiling will be treated in
the pavilion style and frescoed on the
sand plaster. There will be no pillars to
obstruct the view, for the roof is to be sup
ported by spans full across the theater.
As soon as construction begins the place
will present a busy scene, for all contracts
call for the opening of the theater on July
1. On that date there will be a European
orchestra and several variety artists in the
opening performance.
The theater will be built of Oregon pine
throughout and be finished outside with
Oregon pine below and open plaster work
in the upper portion. A feature will be
the three large entrances and two small
ones, which will offer ample exits to let
audiences out in a few minutes. The cost
has been estimated at $15,000 to $20,000.
GOSPEL IN THE FIELDS
The New Wagon, With Preach
ers and Religious Tracts,
Northward Bound.
Rev. H. E. Adams Says 100,000 Amer
icans in the Mountains Are
Ignorant of Christ.
The gospel wagon which is attracting
considerable attention on its way up the
coast passed through San Francisco yes
terday. The wagon, with two others, car
ried nine evangelists and 1000 pounds of
religious papers, tracts and Bibles. Its
principal field of labor is in the country
more than the towns scattered along the
route. 'vl**. â 
The work is under the management of
Baptist ministers and is a new departure
that promises rich results. In evangelisti
cal circles it is regarded as an important
venture. Its object as stated by Rev. H.
E. Adams of San Jose, who is traveling
with the wagon through the Sonoma Val
ley, is "to carry the gospel to the people
living in the mountains and rural districts
throughout the State."
"A look at the map of California," he
con tinued, "will show that more than
four-fifths of the State is mountainous.
These mountains are full of settlements.
It is a I'bct that more than 360,000 people
in California are without religious privi
leges. It is also a tact that more than
100,000 of these are utterly ignorant of
Christ and the plan of salvation. Very
few of these are foreigners. They are
Eastern people, who married, came West,
made a home in the mountains and raised
families. They tell of Snnday-shools of
their childhood days, of a praying mother,
and have wondered that no one came to
tell of God. Their children are ignorant
of him. . AT-;. â¢â â -'
"Those people are not reached, partly
because ministers and workers have con
centrated their energies on .the cities and
towns, where â¢ support to carry on the
work could be obtained, and where there
were fewer obstacles in the way; partly
because of an ignorance" of the needs of
these destitute places. Missionaries are
sent to every little band of Indians, not
realizing the greater multitude of Ameri
cans who are just as needy. 'â "'
"The gospel wa_on is to the 38,000 miles
of wagon road what the chapel earwig, to
the 1700 miles of railroad. Two? workers,
one of whom must be a good singer and
able to play on some instrument, and both
able to speak effectively, these with their
team carry all needed supplies and hold
meetings at " every scboolhouse and I visit
all homes, along the road. , We need.' and
expect to have forty teams in this work.
Every dollar received goes back into the
wagon work. These teams have been
fitted out in San Jose during the past
month by voluntary subscriptions. Mrs.
J. A. Remington of San Jose is in charge
of this part of the movement.
"I am asked if the Salvation Army work
is not the same as this. No, every "soldier
in the Salvation Army is pledged to obey
his | superior. ' In this work there is no
man rule. The Army takes collections at
every service, we never take an offering
unless it be at the close of., a series of
meetings. The Army has the cities as its
principal place - for labor. We have the
country."
The gospel wagon went northward, and
is now in the vicinity of Santa Rosa.
TRIAL BY JURY.
No Trace of the Institution to Be Found
in Anglo-Saxon Times.
No trace of such an institution as a jury
can be found in Anglo-Saxon times, for. if
it had existed, distinct mention would
have been frequently made of it in the
body of Anglo-Saxon laws and con-
temporary chronicles which we pos
sess, extending from the time of Ethel
bert (A. D. 568-616) to the Norman con
quest, but no mention is made.
With respect to criminal trials we meet
in the ordinance of King Ethelred II (988-
1016) with a kind of jury of accusation re
sembling our Grand Jury and possibly its
direct progenitor. In Gemot of every hun
dred, the twelve senior thegns, with the
reeve, were directed to go apart and bring
accusations against all whom they believed
to have committed any crime. But this
jury did not decide the guilt or innocence
of the accused; that had to be decided by
compurgation or the ordeal. This primitive
Grand Jury probably continued in use
after the Norman conquest, until it was
reconstituted by Henry 11. For more
than a hundred years after the conquest
the ancient Anglo-Saxon modes of trial or
forms oi proof,' by crdeal (judicium Dei),
by oath (compurgation, termed later on
"wager .of law"), by witnesses
and production cf characters, con
tinued in general use alongside the Nor
man procedure â the wager of battle, and
the occasional use of the inquest by
sworn recognitors. The Conqueror was
doubtless desirous that the English should
still continue to enjoy the rights and
usages to which they had been accustomed.
Consequently we find that ths distinctive
features of the Angle-Saxon jurisprudence
were retained by the Conqueror. But he
made, however, some important changes
inthe judicial system: he separated the
spiritual and temporal courts; he intro
duced the combat, or duel, as a means of
determining civil suits and questions of
guilt or innocence, and he appointed jus
tices to administer justice throughout the
realm.
It was only by degrees, however, that the
advantages of the principle of recognition
by jury in its application to judicial mat
ters were realized. The sworn inquest ap
pears to have been at first chiefly used for
the determining of non-judicial matters,
such as the ascertaining of the laws of King
Edward, the assessing of feudal taxation
under William II and Henry I, and the
customs of the Church cf York, which the
latter monarch in 1106 directed five com
missioners to verify by the oath cf twelve
of the citizens. On one occasion the Con
queror ordered the Justiciars to summon
the shire moots, which had taken part in a
suit touching the rights of Ely. A num
ber of the English who knew the state of
the lands in question in the reign of Ed
ward were then to be chosen ; these were
to swear to the truth of their depositions,
and action was to be taken accordingly.
But still there are equally early instances
of strictly legal matters being decided by
the recognition on oath of a certain num
ber of probiet legales homines, selected
from the men of the county to represent
the neighborhood and testify to facts of
which they had special knowledge. Recog
nition by jury was applied by Henry II to
every description of business, both" fiscal
and legal. Westminster Review.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 24, 896.
HAYNE STILL
HOLDS HIS OWN
He Accuses the Railway
of Corrupting Law-
Makers.
A SEVERE INDICTMENT.
Many Decisions Cited in Support
of the Position Taken
by Him.
HE SCORES THE DIRECTORS.
How About the "Legal Exprnses"
Incurred by the Company in
Imparting Information ?
The usual barristerial coterie filed into
the United States Circuit Court room yes
terday to hear Attorney 1 Hayne continue
his oft-continued though never tiresome
argument in the action of the Southern
Pacific Company against the Pacific Rail
way Commission. Copious extracts from
the testimony of the company's directors
were read in order to show the principles
which actuated them in their relations
with the Central Pacific Railway Company,
with the express companies and with the
public. As to the land-grant bonds and
the operations carried on with them, Mr.
Hayne read cases and quotations at great
length. .'.''^:'y
"There's a whole raft of expenses," went
on Mr. Hayne, "which cannot be taken
into consideration in the regulation of
rates. There were great sums expended
in corrupting the law-makers of the State,
or, to speak more delicately, in influencing
legislation. This expenditure is cynically
included under the head of 'legal ex
penses,' more's the pity."
"Has there been any showing to that
effect?" interposed Mr. Garber.
"Of course," answered Mr. Hayne,
wheeling about and facing his interlocutor;
"of course you would not come into court
and deliberately state that millions had
been expended by your client for the sole
purpose of corrupting, seducing and bribing
members of the Legislature. But what is
the meaning of the vast sums noted as
having been disbursed in paying 'legal ex
penses?' "
Mr. Hayne then read a large number of
extracts from the former testimony to sup
port his assumption that the company
was guilty of wholesale bribery of legisla
tors and Congressmen. He asked what
methods could justify the company's dis
bursement of $6,000,000 for the purpose of
"imparting information" regarding their
road to members of Congress.
Any agreement having lor its object
the procuring of special legislation should, i
he contended, citing a decision by Justice j
Field, be declared void, even though no j
corrupt means were employed or had in !
contemplation, since all such agreements
had a corrupting tendency.
"Under the principles laid down in the
decisions which I have cited." continued
the' attorney, "the expenses included by
the company under the head of legal ex
penses, but which were in fact incurred in
the corrupting and bribing of legislators,
cannot by any trick or twist be properly
called anything but unlawful expenses â
expenses of such a nature that only the
most hardy claimant could dare to allege
them in his favor in a court of justice.
"When the terms of the contract are sur
rounded by circumstances of a gravely
suspicious character what are we to think?
We have before us facts and figures which
no one presumes to call in question. The
facts are suspicious facts, these figures call
up visions of expenses of a nature more
than suspicious. And yet the suspicions
which these facts and figures call up in
our minds are met by no tangible refuta
tion or explanation. When I have tried
to introduce testimony tending in some
degree to elucidate ths point it has been I
excluded. Now, I want to introduce a
few extracts bearing upon this point in
order to make my contention clearly un
derstood."
"Very well," said Judge McKenna, "we
will hear them to-morrow."
PRESH WATER UNDER THE SEA.
Obtained by Divers From Springs Over
laid by Salt Water.
The hottest region on the earth's surface
is on the southwestern coast of .Persia, on
the border of the Persian Gulf. For forty
consecutive days in the month of July and
August the mercury has been known to
stand above 100 degrees in the shade, night
and day/and to run up as high as 130 de
grees in the afternoon. At Bahrein, in the
center of this most torrid part of this most
torrid belt, as though it were 1 nature's in
tention to make the place as unbearable
as possible, water from wells is something
unknown. Great shafts have been sunk to
a depth of 100, 200, 300 and even 500 feet,
but always with the same resultâ no water.
This serious drawback notwithstanding,
a comparatively numerous population
contrives to live there, thanks to copious
springs which burst from the bottom of
the gulf more than a mile from the shore.
The water from these springs is obtained
in a most curious and novel manner.
Machadores (divers), whose sole occupa
tion is that of furnishing the people of
Bahrein with the' life-giving fluid, repair
to that portion of the gulf where the
springs are situated and bring away with
them hundreds of bags full of water each
day. The water of the gulf where the
springs burst forth is nearly 200 feet deep,
but these machadores manage to fill their
goatskin sacks by diving to the bottom
and holding the mouth of the bags over
fountain jetsâ this, too, without allowing
the salt water of the gulf to mix with it.
The source of these submarine fountains
is thoueht to be in the hills of Osmond,
400 or 500 miles away. Being situated at
the bottom of the gulf it is a mystery how
they were ever discovered, but the fact re
mains that they have been known since
the dawn of history.â Public Opinion.

THE DELEGATES
TO ST. LOUIS
Should Go to the National
/ Convention Un
pledged.
REPUBLICANS' OPINIONS.
Instructed Delegations Have No
Influence in Party
Councils.
THE PRINCIPLE IS WRONG.
Sentiments Distinctly Expressed by
Many Leading Republicans of
California.
The sentiment among leading Republi
cans of California, so far as it can be
ascertained by impartial interviews, is
largely in favor ot sending an unpledged
delegation to the National Conventioa at
St. Louis - -
William H. Crocker had definite views
on the suojectof pledging delegations. He
said: "I am against the principle of in
structing delegates how to vote. Our dele
gates to the St. Louis National Convention
should be permitted to form a judgment
of what should be done after they get
there and look over the field. Events may
occur and conditions change materially
between the time that our State Conven
tion meets at Sacramento ana the assem
bling of the National Convention in June.
It is my opinion that tbe delegates should
be left free to take advantage of any
opportunity presented whereby they can
benefit the State. A delegation bound
and hampered with a pledge to support
only one candidate cannot command in
fluence. It is practically divested of
power at the outset."
P. S. Chadbourne, whose political sa
gacity is scarcely questioned, said: "This
thing of pledging the delegates is non
sense. It is all well enough for our infalli
ble and know-it-all talkers here in Califor
nia to shout that there is only one candi
date for President in the field and that if
the California delegates are not pledged
to swing their votes for that man that all
chance of State recognition by the next
administration will be gone, but the talk
is fallacy. It may turn out when the con
vention meets at St. Louis that there are
other candidates. Assuming that Califor
nia is pledged to vote for McKinley, what
then. Why our delegates are not considered
ânot noticed. Other delegates say, 'Cal
ornia delegates are tied up; no use wasting
any time or giving anything in that direc
tion. They can't change if they want to,
so if recognition is to be offered let us give
it elsewhere ana derive some good out of
it.' What if there should be a break from
McKinley to some other candidate despite
the predictions of our local lights who now
have the whole proceedings of the conven
tion so cleverly mapped out, wouldn't our
pledged delegation be in a fix? Tie up
our delegates for McKinley and tip our
hand before we go to St. Louis and we get
nothing from McKinley because he has
our delegates already pledged. If some
other candidate succeeds we cannot get
in line with the successful combination
because we are tied up with pledges to
McKinley. The delegation ought not to
be pledged. Nothing can be gained by
instructions and very much may be lost.
We don't know it all out here in Califor
nia."
Arthur F. Price said: "I am in favor of
sending to St. Louis an intelligent delega
tion of unpledged men and of trusting to
their intelligence and patriotism. No one
can foretell what changes may take place
in public opinion throughout the country
before the convention meet 3at St. Louis."
, Charles D. Haven said : "I do not take
an active absorbing interest in all political
questions, but on this question of pledging
delegations I am firmly convinced that
our delegates to the St. Louis convention
should not be instructed. We should send
men to the convention who are capable of
forming sound judgment after taking in
the situation."
D. J. Staples, who was a delegate to the
National Republican Convention at Chi
cago which nominated Mr. Lincoln for the
Presidency, and who presented to that
convention Fremont's letter declining to
be a candidate, was interviewed.
. He said "I am heartily in favor of an
uninstructeu delegation. No one can tell
now what will happen in St. Louis, but on
principle 1 am opposed now as I was in
1860 to hampering a delegation with
pledges. Then there was a strong feeling
in the California State Convention that
the vote of California should be cast for
Mr. Seward. So many leading men of the
party refused to acknowledge that there
was any other available candidate that the
delegation was about to be instructed fer
Seward. I opposed the instruction and
indicated that I would not consent to go if
pledged in advance to a course which
might not be found advisable when the
representatives of . the great party as
sembled in convention. The delegation
went unpledged, but in deference to home
sentiment the delegates who in their
hearts had recognized Mr. Lincoln as the
winner and the right man for the place,
did cast their first ballots for Mr. Seward.
The principle of pledging a delegation is

wrong. The interests of the country to be
considered by a National Convention are
vast and varied. Conditions which; are
not contemplated now may arise when the
leaders of the party meet at St. Louis and
exchange views." \ J â â¢-';' -
Lieutenant-Governor Thomas Flint Jr.
said: "The delegates to the National Re
publican Convention should, in my judg
ment, go there unpledged. A pledged
delegation is without influence. It can do
nothing to gain any advantage to tbe
State which it represents. -Its influence is
disposed of before it gets to the conven
tion. Of course 1 hold that our delegates
should act as a unit, and being left per
fectly free and acting in harmony, an alli
ance of. great advantages might be made."
Samuel McMurtre, the railroad builder
who lias had wide experience in Eastern
conventions, frankly expressed the opinion
that a delegation bound and * hampered
with instructions to vote for one candi-
date cuts a very small figure indeed in a
National Convention.
"I hear men talkingat the Union League
Club that McKinley is as good as nomi
nated. I heard the same Kind of talk four
years ago, and won $500 from a man who
knew, as he thought, just what the con
vention would do. There is no certainty
that the convention at St- Louis will
nominate McKinley. Tnis is a big coun
try and the Republican party is a great
party and when the leaders get together
and study up the whole situation and ex
amined the merits and availibiiity of each
candieate it may be deemed wise to nomi
nate some other candidate. The Cali
fornia delegates ought not to be tied up
and set aside, so that they cannot confer
with representatives from other sections
of the country. Mr. Chadbourne says if
the delegation is to be pledged we might
as well send a messenger to cast the
votes." :' â â¢.;""? A-y:y A-Ayy:-:'?:-:.
Paris Kilburn is decidedly in favor of
the convention at Sacramento adopting a
resolution requiring the delegates to the
St. Louis convention to act as a unit and
use all honorable means to secure the
nomination of McKinley. Mr. Kilburn
said: "Let any one study the history of
the unpledged California delegation at the
Minneapolis; convention four years ago.
Our delegates were divided into three
factions. There was no instruction or con
cert of action, so no influence was exerted
and no laurels were gained. Now, the
convention at Sacramento should instruct
our delegates to act as a unit that would
be equivalent to an instruction for McKin
ley, ior already a sufficient number of
McKinley district delegates have been
practically chosen to constitute a majority
of the whole delegation from this State.
"It is the duty, I take of it, of
the State Convention to ascertain the
sentiments and desires of the Re
publicans i of California, and to see
that expression is given at St. Louis to
such sentiments and desires. The dele
gates will go there to represent the Repub
licans of California. If you study the
subject closely you will find the opposi
tion to pledging comes from those who
do not want McKinley nominated."
Alfred Bouvier said: "I want the dele
gation to act as a unit." . â¢
Vanaerlynn Stow said: "The delegation
ought not to be pledged to support any
candidate. The members should have the
right to be guided by their own wisdom
when the convention meets at St. Louis."
SHOULD' XOT BE PLEDGED.
Wisdom of Sot Restricting the California
IfeleantioH.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 23.â"Cali
fornia . Republicans are perplexed not a
little over the question as to whether or
not they will send an instructed delega
tion to St. Louis," remarked L. C. Mc-
Donald, a prominent merchant of San
Francisco, at Willard's.
"I believe they will decide to send an |
unpledged contingent. There is more
real logic in that than in any other course !
and all States that have elected delegates j
thus far would have done wisely, it seems
to me, had they adopted similar tactics of !
letting their representatives go free- i
handed. The Republicans of California
are not really antagonistic to any probable '
condidates. Each leader has of course â¢ a
personal following, and there is doubtless
no other State in the Union where ad
herents are so equally divided among can
didatea for the nomination. 4 -y ;
"If they send an unpledged delegation
it will be distinctly understood tnat it does
not mean antagonism to any leading can
didate. The delegates will be free to make
judicial and unbiased choices, and if all
States bad gone the same the prospects |
for a harmonious convention would have
been better."
A SIX-MINUTE VERDICT
Bayard Saville Found Guilty
of Forging Large
Checks.
A Clumsy Attempt to Forge Mammy
Pleasant's Signature Proved
Most Disastrous.
. . After deliberating but six minutes last
evening the jury that has heard the evi
dence against Bayard Saville, accused of
forging Mammy Pleasant's name to
checks, returned a verdict of "guilty as
charged." He will be sentenced in a week
or two.
The trial was resumed in Department 11
of the Superior Court yesterday morning.
Saville's main defense was that he had re
ceived the checks from, the hands, of
Mammy Pleasant, who manages Mrs.
Bell's business, and, Mammy being sick,
it became necessary for the court to con
vene at that aged colored lady's bedside.
When the Judge, jury, stenographer and
attorneys were assembled about her bedside
in the Bell residence. TG6I Octavia street,
she answered the pertinent questions of
the attorneys in a direct and forcible man
ner. â - â  \\ ;-.â¢";â¢â¢.?
"I never gave * Mr. Saville a check* for
$GSO or one for $75. ' I deny that I ever
tried to break up any relationship existing
between Saville and Mrs. A Bell, and also
that I knew of any relationship existing
between ' them. The | checks were not
signed by me, and â¢ therefore must sbe â¢ a
forgery. I have known Mr. Saville for
some time, and knew that ihe was man
aging Mrs. Bell's ranch, near Glen Ellen,
but he had not .been in her employ for
three or four months prior to the time the
checks were purported to have been signed
by me."
The court was in session at Mammy's
bedside less than fifteen ; minutes, but
during that time the old lady convinced
many of her hearers that she had nothing
to do with the checks on which Saville had
raised his hundreds.
â  Mammy has been in poor â¢ health for
several weeks past, and the taking of . the
deposition yesterday proved quite a severe
strain. ' *
Mrs. Bell's testimony to the effect that
no checks of 'the amount specified had
been authorized by her was lully cor
roborated.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 24, 1896.
DID BLYTHE
LEAVE A WILL?
Another Sensation Sprung
In the Celebrated
Case.
DEMAND ON W. H. H. HART
Papers to Be Filed To-Day to
Compel Him. to Probate
a Copy. -
INTERESTING DEVELOPMENTS.
Colonel Kowalsky Says That Ganeral
Hart Agreed to Pay Mrs.
Carr $5000.
The Blythe case, so prolific in gypsies,
heirs, Scandals and sensations, was be
lieved to have been quietly laid on the
shelf when the property was turned over
to Florence Blythe-Hinkley, but this be
lief was unfounded, for the Blythe case
has a lively faculty of resurrecting itself,
and always with a jolly ghost or two to
keep it company. _â¢ 'â :'â :' .'/
The first aftermath sensation was noted
in The Call a day or * two ago when men
tion was made of an attachment suit be
gun by T. I. Bergin against the Blythe
estate to recover $15,000,- alleged to have
been advanced to Florence Blythe by Law
yer Bergin during the progress of the will
contest.
Yesterday a bigger sensation than any
of the others was sprung by Attorneys E.
J. rringle, H. B. M. Miller and Mr. Wat
son, when they called upon General W. H.
H. Hart and made a demand that he
should file for probate a purported copy of
a will of Thomas H. Blythe, said copy
being in the possession . of Mrs. Carr, a
client of the lawyers already mentioned.
Mrs. Carr claimed |5000, which, according
to the terms of the cony of the will, was a
legacy from Blythe to her husband. Gen
eral Hart refused to treat with the lawyers
or their client, and they went away, after
having notified General Hart that they
would begin proceedings against him to
day.
Colonel H. I. Kowalsky, who had been
intimately connected with the Blythe
case, was seen by a Call man last night at
his apartment in the Baldwin Hotel, and
made a statement to the following effect:
"Early in the. proceedings in the Blythe
estate some . persons, whose names 1 do
not now remember, claimed to be In pos
session of the will of Thomas H. Blythe.
Ex-Superior Judge T. K. Wilson, since
dead, came up from Los Angeles as coun
sel for those parties, the principal one of
whom was a woman. They produced
what purported to be a copy of the will,
but which on its face was not such, it be
ing made up of scraps of information
which they found floating about in
the newspapers. The attorneys for
the estate, Messrs. Garber, Boalt &
Bishop, General Hart, myself and others
looked Into the matter and found that
there was nothing in it; that the pretended
copy was no copy at all. but a fraud, like
all of the others that were harassing the
estate at that time.
"Right here, General Hart did one of
the most foolish things imaginable. He
allowed Judge Wilson to persuade him to
agree to pay the woman $25 or $30 per
month until a sum amounting to $5000
bad been paid off. We advised General
Hart not to do anything of the kind, but
judge Wilson succeeded in influencing
him to do so. There is absolutely noth
ing in this woman's claim, and we dis
missed it as we did scores of others. It
had been reported that Blythe's will had
been found. ' and General Hart had
offered $100,000 to the person who would
produce it; and when? he went to : Los An
geles to see i those people he found that
they had only a pretended copy."
General Hart's version, as given last
night, differs materially from that of
Colonel Kowalsky. The general flatly de
nied ever having paid the woman a cent.
He said :
"Lamey and Wilson looked into the
matter and found that there was nothing
in it. These people claimed that they
could produce a copy of the will, but they
did not do so. I knew as soon as I set my
eyes on it that it was a fraud. They
claimed to have the original will, but I
made up my mind, that it was a myth and
had nothing to do with it. The same con
clusion was also reached by Mr. Boalt and
the rest of â my associates. It was then
that we sent to Mr. Estee, with the re
quest that he should undertake to probate
it. He investigated the matter and came
to the conclusion that there was nothing
in it. I know nothing of any payments
having been' made to the woman. v
"Mrs. Carr has authorized her attorneys
to bring suit, alleging that I should have
probated the copy of the will, and her at
torneys to-day demanded $5000 from me,
that ing the amount which was purported
to have been bequeathed to her husband
by Blythe in the copy of the will. I told
them to go ahead; and file all the suits
they wanted. . . . lAO'I-aA
"It will be remembered that early in the
contest there was a well-defined impres
sion that Blythe had left a will, and I
offered a certain amount of money to the
person who; would produce it, but it was
never produced." yy

NAMED AFTER A TEACHER
Completion of the New Dudley
C. Stone School Build-
The Public Will Be Allowed to Visit
the Schoolhouse To-Morrow
and Sunday.
On Monday next the Buildings and
Grounds Committee of the Board of Edu
cation will make its final visit to the now
completed Dudley C. Stone schoolhouse
on Haight and Lott streets, with a view of
testing the heating apparatus of the in
stitution and formulating the report on
which will depend the acceptance or non
acceptance of the building by the board.
The Stone School is built on lines different
from any other under the control of the
San Francisco School Department, all of
the classrooms being on the sunny side and
so arranged that the health-giving light
reaches them at all times during school
hours. The : corridors and rooms that are
little used are on the shady side. The
building is one of the handsomest yet
erected by the department and is a matter
of much pride to the | residents of the
neighborhood of Haiâht and Lott streets.
The cost of the building 7 complete, in
cluding the heating and ventilating sys
tem, was $27,000. This money was derived
from the rentals of the Market and Fifth
street property, formerly under the con
trol of the Board of Supervisors but now
controlled by the Board of Education.
The building is colonial in style, with
classical details of the Greek-lonic order,
which is considered appropriate for the
architecture of an educational institution.
The new school will be open for The in
spection of the public Saturday, and Sun
day, April 25 and 26.
Dudley C. Stone, after whom the school
is named, was a special teacher of elemen
tary science, and was killed by an electric
car on December 1, 1895. Mr. Stone was
elected a teacher of the public schools in
this City in July. 1873, after having taught
a few years in the private schools of Oak
land and Berkeley.
He , was appointed Deputy Superinten
dent by H. M. Bolander in 1875, reap
pointed by A. *L. Mann in 1877 and by J.
W. Taylor in 1880. At the expiration of
Superintendent Taylor's term in 1883 Mr.
Stone was elected teacher of science in the
Girls' High School.
.As Deputy Superintendent Mr. Stone
was a judicious adviser of teachers, a fre
quent and welcome visitor to their classes
and excellent examiner oi the schools,
under the former system of periodic writ
ten examinations, directed by the Super
intendent. AuAa-a. Â A.yyA.'A
As a teacher he had a bright, active
mind, a vast store of information, a . pro
digious memory, a clear : style, a ready
exposition, a warm sympathy with his pu
pils and a youthful freshness of feeling and
manner that remained his most striking
characteristic to the end of his life.
THE FAIR WILL CASE.
Attorneys for the Daughters Demur to
Mr. Paterson'g Third Amended
Opposition...
The attorneys for Virginia Fair and Mrs.
Oelrichs filed their demurrer yesterday to
the third amended? opposition of Van R.
Paterson to the Fair will of the 24th on the
several grounds that have been recited in
the previous demurrers 2 and some new
ones; that Mr. Paterson, as representing
the minor heirs, has , no legal capacity to
make the contest; that the facts presented
are insufficient to form a ground of con
test that there -is made an improper
joinder of the parties; that* the petition is
defective, in that it does not show that
the interests are different under the two
wills; that the court bad no power to ap
point Mr. Paterson as counsel for the chil
dren, and, finally that the; statement that
there had been a republication of the will
of the 21st on November 26 was not sup
ported by any statement of facts.
The demurrer will be argued this after
noon before Judge Slack.

them. The witnesses against him are the
property-owners whose names were fraudu
lently put upon the contract.

HOSPITAL FUNDS
BEING WATCHED
.. *' â 
Result of the Grand Jury's ,
Recent and Sudden
Raid.
SUGAR BELOW STANDARD
Filthy Floors That Aroused the
Curiosity of the Mem
bers.
EXPENDITURES QUESTIONED.
A Recommendation May Ec Made That
the Nurses' Training Class
Be Abolished.
The manner in which the -funds appro
priated for the maintenance of the City
and County Hospital are expended will
form the subject of an investigation by the
Grand Jury during the next few weeks,
and a number of witnesses have already
been called to testify, as to the condition
of the institution, and particularly as to
the food tnat is served to the inmates.
In its recent communication to the
Board of Health, the Grand Jury stated
that it had found much mismanagement
in the institution and that the subject
would be more fully treated in a second
letter, the brevity of the first communica
tion precluding any extended explanation.
Since then the jury has decided to go even
more deeply into the matter. ?v*i 'â¢-. ,
The decision to investigate has been
brought about by the 1 things seen during
the recent sudden and unexpected visit of
the' jurymen to the City and County insti
tution. The trip had been kept an abso
lute secret by the members, and the offi
cials at the City and County Hospital
were as much surprised as was Superin
tendent Weaver of the Almshouse when a
line of carriages drew up before the gates
and nineteen grand jurymen stepped out
and, without further ceremony, began an
inspection of the building and grounds,
scattering in all directions, so that no
preparations could be made for their re
ception in any of the departments.
"The wisdom of this course," said one
of the jurymen yesterday, "was manifested
by what we found in all directions at the
hospital â filth, carelessness and misman
agement. We were amazed that the place
was not even clean when cleanliness is one
of the greatest needs in a place where sick
people are confined and battling for health
or even life. ;:?Vy^ A- fly
"The floors, walls, and even the tables,
were, in some instances, filthy, showing
an utter want of attention on the part of
the officials. It would seem to me that
with the amount of money appropriated
for this institution it could at least be
kept clean, and it is this phase of the mat
ter that we will investigate particularly.
One thing that struck us forcibly was the
quality of the sugar served at the inmates'
tables. : It was almost black, showing that
it : was" entirely unrefined and not fit for
the use of sick men. yy' "Ay Af ?â¢ ,-' â %'â 
"The Supervisors' specifications, when in
viting bids for supplies, call for a good
quality of sugar, as well as other supplies,
and yet they do not reach the hospital.
The superintendent was asked about the
matter, and replied that if the contractor
did not send good sugar he could not help
it. It would seem to me that it was his
duty to report that he was not getting
what the contract calls for, if he inspects
supplies as close by as he claims to, and as
he should;
â  "Then comes one of the most important
matters that has reached our ears. We
understand .' that a polyclinic of young
women, who are studying to become
nurses, is kept at the hospital, and that all
members are fed and kept at the expense
of the City and County. Â â 
"They are supposed to assist* in caring
for the patients, but while novices amount
to very little as help, and when they attain
any degree of proficiency, they obtain cer
tificates to that effect and leave to earn
good salaries. * , ~"* Ay', '- '
"The money expended to keep these thirty
or ; forty women would hire a few good
nurses and leave enough to pay for scrub
bing dirty floors occasionally. It is prob
able, that we will make some strong recom
mendations on these lines."
BAY CITY CLUB WINS.
The Trouble Over the Relay Race De
| cided in Its Favor After a Long?
Discussion.
. A special meeting of the California As
sociated Cycling Clubs was held last even
ing at the Olympic Club.to adjust the dif
ficulties that have arisen since the . great
100-mile relay race on Sunday, April 12. '.."
' There was a large attendance at the
meeting, delegates ; being present from the
Acme Club, Wheelmen, Alameda Cyclers,
Bay City Wheelmen, California Cycling
Club, Call Bicycle Club, Crescent Athletic
Club, Diamond Cycling Club, Garden City
Cyclers, Golden Gate .. Cycling . Club, Im
perial Cycling, Liberty Cycling Club,-
Olympic Club Wheelmen, Olympic Cyclers.
Pathfinder Bicycle Club, Reliance I Club
Wheelmen, Santa Rosa Wheelmen, San
Francisco Road Club, Triangle Wheelmen;
San Jose Road Club. The only. two clubs
not represented were the Crescent Road
Club and Waverley Cycling Club. _-
â  The entire evening was spent in discuss
ing the ; disqualification of the Bay City
Wheelmen for improperly passing the re
lay packet at the end of the sixth station. :
A 'great \ many;, witnesses and affidavits
were presented upon this question, and
by a vote of 45 to 2 it was decided to over
rule the referee's decision and disallow the
protest.
The other .question presented was
whether Kraft and Williamson, who rode
two ; relays I for the Bay City's, had been
members of that club for 60 days prior to
the race, a rule of the ? association \. requir
ing this. The Bay City Wheelmen easily
proved this to the f, satisfaction of the dele
gates, and that question was settled.
Upon motion, it I was unanimously de
cided to award the race and trophy to the
Bay City. Wheelmen. ,
The contest upon the disqualification
and . protests ;: were presented by S. G.
Tompkins, :l vice-president of j the Garden
City Cyclers, and defended by F. H. Ker
rigan, president of the ; Bay f City a Wheel
men,*and J. F. ; Coffey, president of the
Olympic Cycler?. Some feeling shown
on, both sides during the controversy, and
the evidence times * was contradictory,
hut tbe result. l reached finally satisfied
every one, and the meeting ended at mid
night with pleasant ? words and : congratu
latory speeches. -
