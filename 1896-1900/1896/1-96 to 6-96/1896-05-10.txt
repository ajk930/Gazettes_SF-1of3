[Copyright, 1896, by the New York Times.]
LONDON, Ekg., May 9.â Almost every
commentator on yesterday's debate in the
House of Commons brings mention of
"Warren Hastings into his remarks. It is
a natural enough allusion, for there is nu
other passage in the big story of the
British empire that has been made which
bo tits with his modern instance.
Apparently the similarity has to extend
still further, for the famous impeachment
proceedings against the Governor-General
of India lasted, in one form or another, for
seven years, and, judging by the glimpses
vouchsafed us into the Ministerial mind,
the Cecil Khodes affair is planned to string
itself out over a scarcely shorter period.
From the point of view of oratory, which
is all any one thinks of now with reference
to the Hastings trial, 1 fear the nineteenth
century will come out hadly in comparison
with its predecessor. There is no Burke,
Fox or even Sheridan now to snatch im
mortality for himself out of this morass of
stock- jobbing treason.
Old tsir William Harcourt made the best
speech of his life last night, and now that
Gladstone is gone there is no other man in
the House who could have risen anywhere
so near to the plane of parliamentary
usages of a hundred years ago; but when
he look his seat the debate was brought
down with a jerk to the most up-to-date of
modern levels. There it will remain.
Chamberlain's glib defense of himself
rather puzzled the House that listened to
it. .Now, upon reflection, it is seen to be
also the deform: ot Rhodes and L;.Â« lelicr.T
conspir^tors, and it is not liked. By Mon
day, I imagine, it will come to be .haled
'by the men who to-day are still wavering
in judgment on it. it will not be surpris
ing if, before the end of next week, it
should be practically repudiated by the
acts of the Government and explained
away by Chamberlain himself.
He began last January by resolute action
against Rhodes and the chartered com
pany. When it could not be proved that
they had done anything literally culpable,
even while he accepted thei- assurances of
.personal innocence, he insisted that they
had forfeited public confidence and he
pledged himself by speech and deed alike
to see justice done.
Now wa are in May, and these men are
admittedly proven to have a guilty Knowl
edge of the plot against the Transvaal, to
have organized and paid for Jameson's
raid, to have lied to her Majesty's Gov
ernment and to have been false to every
obligation as subjects and as men. Cham
berlain, however, has quite outgrown his
stern midwinter mood.
Although the Commons contains now
no orator like Burke or Fox, it contains
500 or more men who do not sit for rotten
boroughs, and who have constituents who
read the papers every day.
These constitunents have read during
the last week with astonishment Kruger's
first batch of revelations as to the base
ness, venality and disloyalty of the
chartered company leaders who were rep
resenting Great Britain in South Africa.
To-day comes another installment of
these extraordinary proofs and next week
we are promised more, showing conclu
sively how the thieves fell out about the
division of their expected plunder and
how this alone prevented the comsum
mation of the crime which they all had in
m-ind. These things are being read, dis
cussed and digested by millions of Eng
lishmen. They are rejognized everywhere
as staining the English name with the
foulest kind of dishonor and consciousness
of this cannot be allayed by subsidized
press pleadings or obscured by ministerial
indirection.
Cecil Rhodes should have been stricken
from the Queen's Privy Council eight
days ago, the charter of the South African
Company and its assets should have been
impounded and every one of its agents
and officials should have been suspended
from official place. Tiiat would have been
the very least that the Government could
do in the face of these disgraceful dis
closures; yet we see instead Chamberlain
urging people to remember how good a
man Rhodes used to be, naminp remote
dates for a possible inauiry into the scan
dal, which will make the whole thing a
farce, and meanwhile moving not a finger
to remove thi3 blot from the national
escntcheon. If I know anything about the
English people, they will not submit in
patience to this. lam told that Rhodes
and Beit, the latter a Hamburg Jewish-
German subject, whose prominence in the
conspiracy gives it a quaint turn, are to
plead tbat it was all done for the expan
sion of the British empire, and they are
also said to have offered the Transvaal
authorities $12,500,000 to quash the trial at
f.retoria and let all go free.
Our understanding here is that the ag
gregate of tines ultimately imposed will
not reach anything like tl is sum, but
Kruger properly declined to n>ake money
in this way or to deal with anybody ex
cept the British imperial authority.
Rumors of Lord Salisbury's ill-health
are about again, and I have even heard a
circumstantial Btory that the Duke of
Devonshire is going to take ovtr the For
eign Office, but I am quite unable to say
what likelihood there is that the report is
The San Francisco Call
true. For the moment the new situation
in Persia is occupying the attention of
Downing street, and of Asiatic aspects
generally to the exclusion of other aspects
of the international outlook. The new
Shah is known to be in Russian hands,
and it is assumed that Persia, under him,
will become a sort of Russian Afghanis
t in. wliile England's practical supremacy
in the Persian Gull will be called in ques
tion by France.
It is whispered about that very disquiet
ing reports have come from the British
political resident at Bushire, on this gulf,
not only as-to the general situation, but as
to the actual safety of himself and his
suite, for they are again menaced with per
sonal violence. There is no way of verify
ing these reports, but all the old Indians I
know say the position there is critical.
Unhappily, British relations abroad are
critical at so many points that one added
cause for alarm hardly counts.
The preDarations at Moscow for the
grand ceremonial now so near at hand, be
gun perforce solonga^o, have been so com
prehensively described beforehand that
little is left to the correspondents, who are
leaving to chronicle the event itself.
Considering the difficult relations ex
isting between England and Russia, or
rather between the foreign offices of the
two countries, people both here and else
where are much mystified by the state
ment that the Czar has accepted an invi
tation from the British Ambassador to a
banquet during the coronation festivities.
It iÂ« contrary to Russian etiquette for the
Czar to dine out when" in the empire, and
the late Czar would never have dreamed
of such a thing. It is the knowledge of
this presumably inflexible rule which pre
vented the French Embassador from sug
gesting the idea on behalf of his own
country, but this does not prevent the
French now from regarding with amazed
disgust the fact that this extraordinary
exception is to be made in favor of the
British.
The Parisian journals cling still to the
hope that the report will be denied, al
though it seems to be authentic enough.
What it means is most probably that the
young Czarina has succeeded in getting
her husband to accept the invitation of Sir
Nicholas O'Connor as an offset to Prince
Lobanoffs vigorous anti-British foreign
polioy. Her own sympathies are fervently
on the side of an Anglo-German combina
tion, and it is safe to suspect in this epi
sode the assertion of her personal influ
ence.
French republicans of the old school
must be learning with mixed emotions
the fact that the two magnificent carriages
to be used by the representatives of France
in the state procession at Moscow are bor
rowed by the republic from the ex-Empress
Eugenic.
They were built for the christening of
the Prince Imperial forty years aÂ»o, and
were never publicly used thereafter. When
the. Emperor fell they happened to be at a
coachmaker's for renovation, and there
thpy have remained ever since, till the
emergency of the Czar's coronation re
called attention to them. Eugenic refused
to sell or let them for hire, but said she
would be pleased to lend them gratis,
which the republic* accepted with the
added remark that though it would be
necessary. to paint out the imperial em
blems on the carriages, they should after
ward'be restored to their original state.
To this Eugenic replied that 1 she begged
no such renovation would be thought
essential, as after their return from Mos
cow it was her intention to have them
broken up.
This incident of the carriages attracts
the more notice as there are vague stories
that Prince Louis Jerome, who is now 32
years old and a Russian officer, is to be at
Moscow during the ceremonies and is to
have such marked notice paid him under
bis new style as "General Bonaparte" that
tne French people will be led to imagine
that he is very high in Russia's favor.
Incidentally it may be mentioned that
apparently as a result of public comment
three orthodox Jewish rabbis have at the
last moment been invited to witness the
coronation.
Cardinal Galimberti's death was so un
expected and withal involves such im
portant consequences in European politics
that it is only natural the Italians should
leap to the conclusion that he was
poisoned. This report is openly discussed
in the Italian press, but there is no reason
to suppose that it has any foundation in
fact. A> oftpn said before in these dis
patches, Galimberti was a most powerful
restraining influence in Vatican politics.
He was the tireless advocate of the policy
of not butting the Papacy's head against a
etone wall, and of recognizing the exist
ence of obvious facts. His strength and
value lay not only in his clear perception
of the importance of leaning on the triple
alliance and coming to an intelligent,
permanent understanding with the Italian
monarchy, but also in the fact that he had
a great deal of personal influence with the
Pope and was thus often able to block the
plans of Cardinal Eampolla and his ultra
montane following.
With him gone, however, the liberal ele
ment in the sacred college is left without
a natural leader, and may very likely go
to pieces as an organized force, and cer
tainly the chances that it will elect the
next Pope are greatly lessened.
It is not believed in German commercial
circles that the Federal Council will
give its consent to the Reichstag's
prohibiting dealing in grain futures. I
understand tbat the Hamburg bourse
leaders have taken the initiative in warn
ing the Government that if such a pro
hibition should be enforced they will sim
ply transfer their whole business to New
York and Chicago, and buy and sell there
as before. To meet this the Agrarian pro
moters of the bill say that it will be suffi
cient to add a clause declaring such trans
actions not valid in Germany, but this will
involve an infraction of existing commer
cial treaties and thus afford the Govern
ment a legitimate pretext for putting its
foot on the measure as a whole.
Probably most Americans will be sur
prised to learn tbat by order of the Home
Secretary the principle of separating
juvenile 3in prisons from adults is for the
lirst time officially affirmed in England.
To some extent it has already been
adopted in practice, but hereafter it is to
be the universal rule. Unfortunately as
the laws stand 16 is the age limit, beyond
which offenders become adults, so this ad
ministrative reform misses altogether a
large class of youths of 17 and 18 who per
haps need it even more than their juniors,
but it would need a statute to alter this,'
and Parliament is already so clogged with
work that it is impossible to expect that
this will be done during the present year.
Sir John Millais, I am told, is in such a
precarious state of health that his death
may be expected any day. He still works

a little and still gets about some, but he is
under a medical warning that his tenure
of life is merely from week to week.
James Tissot's great plan of illustrating
the Bible is now on the point of comple
tion and it is understood that when the
work is definitely finished, perhaps next
year, he will leave the world and pass the
rest of his days as a Trappist monk.
Morse's "Biography of Oliver Wendell
Holmes," published here to-day, gets long
reviews in most of the morning papers,
made from advanced copies. They are all
tenderly appreciative of their subject and
are pretty unanimous in praise of the
book as well. Paget's memoirs are also
enjoying an immense critical success.

HERE'S A NEW OCTOPUS.
It Will Control All Traffic Between the
Rocky Mountains and the
Atlantic Coast
CHICAGO, 111.. May O.â A morning
paper says: It was reported yesterday
that the near future would see the birth in
Chicago of a new and gigantic traffic asso
ciation, tbat would have for its object the
general control of all traffic affairs between
the Rocky Mountains and the Atlantic
I Coast, and contain within its limits all the
roads now members of the Western Freight
and Passenger Association, the Joint
j Traffic Association and the Southern
I States Association.
The new organization is to be nothing
more nor less than a blanket association
that will dominate the other bodies, which
will be subject to its jurisdiction.
As yet it is impossible to learn the plan
to be -worfced out, Out it is definitely
known that the headquarters of the new
and all-powerful octopus will be in this
city. The object of the association is the
simplifying of opposition work, ths reduc
ing of the tremendous expense incurred in
maintaining such organizations, and the
retiring of some of the expensive army of
commissioners, chairmen, boards of man
agers ai\d secretaries who now dominate
and rule without any great benefit to the
stockholders of the railroad companies.
An official conversant with the matter
said that the task of putting into active
operation such a vast traffic association
was so great, and involved so many deli
cate questions, that it would probably be
months before anything definite or tangi
ble could be said about it. About the only
subject so far decided was tbat the boards
of directors of all the roads would have a
representative, who in some manner would
act directly for it, and that all earnings
would go into a common pool.
TRIED THE SECOND TIME,
Mrs. Iren Leonard Yet Held for
the Murder of Her
Husband.
Evidence That She Conspired With
a Divorced Spouse to Commit
the Crime.
WICHITA. Kans., May 9.â Mrs. Ireriel
Leonard is beyig tried the second time for 1
the murder of her husband, H. L. Leonard.
The murder occurred in this city on the
night of November 17, and Mrs. Leonard,
her divorced husband, F. M. Williamson,
and their son Norville Williamson, were
arrested for the crime. Williamson was
tried and acquitted. The jury in Mrs.
Leonard's first trial disagreed, and the
son's case has not yet come to trial. The
murder was one of the most brutal ever
committed in this part of the State.
Leonard is presumed to have been killed
while in bed in bis own home. His body
was then dressed and carried into the
alley back of the barn.
He carried a $5000 insurance policy in
favor of his wife, and it was brought out
in the evidence at the former trials tha'.
Mrs. Leonard and her divorced husband
were seen out riding the day previous to
the killing, and that Williamson was read
ing Leonard's insurance policy. The theory
of the State is that the insurance policy
furnished the motive for the crime. A
jury was secured with the greatest diffi
culty.
The evidence of ex-Coroner McColiier
waa given this afternoon. He identified
the bloody relics of the tragedy, detailed
the finding of the body and described the
sickening scene at the Leonard home so
graphically tnat the defendant broke Into
a flood of tears. There is intense interest
in the trial.

PEOVISIONS OF THE TREATY.
An Article Requiring Counsel for the
Defense and the Attendance
of Witnesses.
WASHINGTON. D. C, May 9.-It is
stated here that the enforcement of the
do:Â»th sentence on the men caught on the
filibuster schooner Competitor is liable to
bring about a crisis in the relations be
tween Spain and tne United States. It is
understood that this Government will not i
allow the execution to take place without
a vigorous protest.
Secretary Olney several days ago sent in
structions of no uncertain tone to Consul-
General Williams. These formed the
basis for the representations made by Wil
liams to the court-martial yesterday.
Every effort is being made to prevent the
execution of the sentence until this Gov
ernment can make a thorough investiga
tion on which to base its appeals or de
mands.
it is understood the friendly offices
which the State Department is exerting in
behalf of Owen Milton of Kansas, sen
tenced by court-martial to be shot in Cuba,
are limited to the complaint that the
verdict was reached in a summary man- I
ncr, without giving any opportunity for j
defense, and too hastily to examine into
all the circumstances of the cases. The
effort now being made at Madrid and
Havana is, therefore, to be in the line of
securing a delay of execution for a suffi
cient time to permit such an investigation
of the Competitor incident as is demanded
ill the interests of humanity.
It is not thought that any attempt will
be made to secure a civil trial for Milton
or any of his associates who may be found
to be bona-fide Americans.the treaty under
which such transfer of jurisdiction has
been hitherto made appearing to have no
bearing in the present instance. The first
article of the protocol between the United
States and Spain, signed January 12, 1877,
concerning judicial procedure, provides
as follows :
No citizen of the United States residing in
Spain, her adjacent islands or her ultra-marine
possessions, charged with acts of sedition,
treason or conspiracy against the institutions,
the public security, the Integrity of the terri
tory or against the supreme Government, or
any other crime whatsoever, shall be subject
to trial by any exceptional tribunal, but ex
clusively by the ordinary jurisdiction, except
in the case of being captured with arms in
hand.
Under this article many Americans resi
dent in Cuba the past year had their cases
i transferred to civil courts through the in
tervention of Consul-General Williams,
but there does not appear to be the slight
est ground for claiming Milton to be a
I "resident" of Cnba and the article cannot,
therefore, be made to apply to him.
The same protocol, however, which was
negotiated by Caleb Cushing, further pro
vides that those taken with arms in hand,
as excepted in the article quoted, shall be
tried by ordinary council of war, shall
have counsel to defend them and the right
to compel the attendance of witnesses.
This clause also relates only to residents.
DR. DELEGATION CLAIM.
On Hit Way to Washington to Interview
Seeretarv Olney.
NEW YORK. N. V., May 9.-A Herald
special from Washington says: Dr. Jose
Manuel Delgado, upon whom Spanish
soldiers committed an outrage on March 4
in Cuba, has filed a claim through Consul-
General Williams for $200,000 damages.
The claim is now being considered by the
State Department authorities, and as soon
as the Spanish Government makes apology
for the occurrence the department will
probably present the claim to its attention.
The claim is in part for personal injuries
inflicted on Dr. Delgado. According to
the investigation made by the State De
partment officers in Cuba, Dr. Delgado
was badly maltreated, and had it not been
for the prompt interference of General
Weyler, as a result of the protest of Con
sul-General Williams, he would probably
have been killed. As it was, his head was
cut by several sword blows, and he received
a bullet in his tbigb.
In addition, some of the men employed
on his estate were killed, and his property
was ruined, fiis father, also an American
citizen, and who as well has a claim
against the Spanish Government, was on
the estate at the time, and it was he who
advised Consul-General Williams of his
son's peril.
Dr. Delgado, the State Department offi
cials have been informed, left Cuba for the
United States, and he is expected to ap
pear before Secretary Olney and person
ally acquaint that official with the out
rages committed upon him and his family.
Mrs. Ellen Spencer Massey, who is look
ine out for the legal interests of Mr. Del
pado Sr., is also interested in the son's
case. She declares there is no doubt as to
the citizenship of the Delgados, both hav
ing been naturalized in New Yorfc and
having resided there.

THE CONDEMNED TILDUNTERS.
Were Unarmed When Captured and Of
fered Jo Resistance.
MADRID, Spaix, May 9.â A cablegram
from Havana says that the filibusters cap
tured on the Competitor have been sen
tenced to death. They are: Alfredo La
borde of New Orleans, Owen Milton of
Kansas William Kinle, an Englishman,
and Elia.7 Bedia and Isador de la Maza,
Cubans.
The trial began at the Havana Arsenal
yesterday morning. The accused pleaded
uot guilty, and witnesses admitted tbat
when the men were captured they were
not armed, and offered no resistance. The
prosecuting officer demanded their con
viction and condemnation to death, and
United States Consul-General Williams
made a written protest against the trial.

province Pinar del Rio, the latter part of

PROHIBITION FACTIONS,
There Will Be a Lively Time
at the Convention at
Pittsburg.
Sentiment Appears to Favor Joshua
Levering lor the Presidential
Nomination.
PIITSBURG, Pa., May 9.â lnterest in
the National gathering of Prohibitionists
in Pittsburg during the week of May 26 is
becoming more marked as tne time for the
convention approaches. That there will
be a lively time over the adoption of the
platform is indicated by the almost even
division of sentiment amone the various
State delegations elected, over the "broad"
and "narrow gauge" issue. The Prohi
bitionists are divided into two factions,
the one which favors free silver, protection
and other disputed policies, being distin
guished as "broad gauge."
The other faction, equally strong, favors
a narrow-gauge platform, which^compre
bends bat one thing â the indorsement of
prohibition. While it is uncertain, owing
to the size of the field of candidates for
the Presidential nomination, who will be
successful, sentiment appears to be grad
ually veering toward Joshua Levering of
Baltimore, a narrow-gauge man and one
of the prominent prohibition leaders of
the country. '-^
DON M. DICKINNUN'S HEPLF.
Explains That Offlce- Holder* Hid Not
Control the Convention*
DETROIT, Mich., May 9.-Hon. Don M.
Dickinson to-day gave out for publication
a reply to the charges made in the United
States Senate Thursday by Senator Vest
in regard to the control of the Michigan
State Democratic convention by office
holders. Mr. Dickinson says that Senator
Vest is in error in all of his state
ments about the Michigan convention,
as are the other Southern Senators
who have been making threats of
Senatorial investigation of the campaign
culminating in that convention. He as
serts that neither Chairman Stevenson nor
anybody else issued any circular to office
holders in connection with that conven
tion.
Office-holders favorable to the adminis
tration were outnumoered in both county
and State conventions by office-holders
with free silver proclivities. Mr. Dickin
son declared that the Chicago convention
will not favor the policy of free coinage at
the ratio of 16 to 1.
"SILK STOCKING" REPUBLICANS.
They Will Carry the Fight Against Fil
ley to the Convention.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., May 9.â As a protest
against an arbitrary action of the Re
publican Central Committee at the city
convention two weeks ago, at which the
Keren s-Frank-Walbridge faction was ig
nored in the choice of delegates, a mass
meeting of "silk stocKing" Republicans
was beid at the courthouse at 1 o'clock
this afternoon. It was the intention of
the promoters to el*>ct delegates to the
State Convention at St. Joseph next Mon
day who would repudiate the dictation of
Btcfel Chairman Filley and contest the
seats of the recently elected delegates.
When the mass-meeting had assembled,
it was found that the Filleyites had
packed the meeting. There was a great
deal of disorder, but ex-Congressman
Frank finally read a list of eighteen dele
gates as named by the anti-Filleyites and
made a motion that they be declared the
"regular" delegates to the State Conven
tion. The motion was declared carried
pniid a howl of protests. Collector Zeigen
heim (Filleyite) then came to the front
with a speech, and the mob, in response to
his appeal, ratified the action of the city
convention two weeks ago. The con
test will be carried out on the floor of the
State convention.

HUNDREDS MADE HOMELESS.
A Fire, Supposed to Have Been Started
by Strikers, Sweeps the Vil
lage of Lanse.
MARQUETTE, Mich., May 9.â The vil
lage of Lanse, on Keweenaw Bay, seventy
miles west of Marquette, narrowly escaped
destruction by flre, which started this
afternoon in the mill of the Lanse Lumber
Company. For several days the millhands
have been on strike, and it is believed
some hot-headed strikers applied the
torch to the mill. The mill was destroyed
and the high winds carried the flames into
the business center, where they were con
fined by hard work to six buildings. The
loss will approximate $600,000.
The fire destroyed the lumber docks and
three million feet of lumber belonging to
the Lanse Sawmill Company. Tho ore
docks were also burned Many residences
were also burned. So far as is known no
lives have been lost, but more than 250
persons are homeless.
FOUR LI VES WERE LOST.
.If en Perished During the Burning of
Milling Property.
ASHLAND, Wis., May 9.â Half a mil
lion dollars', worth of milling property
and lumber went up in smoke here to-day,
and four lives were lost. The Shores Lum
ber Company's mill, the largest on Che
quamegon Bay, is in ruins, and several
thousand feet of its lumber dock, which
contained about 19,000 feet of lumber, is
burned to the water's edge. The fire
started on W. R. Durfee's lumber docks.
It was not a very extensive loss of prop
erty, but it is reported at least four lives
were lost in heroic efforts to beat back the
flames. At 11:30, when the flames burst
from the lumber-piles into the sawmill, it
cut off retreat for several men who were at
the outer edge of the mili, fighting back
the flames. All the men succeeded in
reaching the tramways except one, John
Nolander, who was enveloped in a sheet
of flame, then, jumping from a spile into
the bay, was seen to drown by thousands
of people who lined the shore.
Three other men, whose names arÂ» un
known, also lost their lives. Three bodies
have been recovered.

sion to-night with a steam-beer smile and
stage strut, and much royal purple, and
fiddles three, and a dragon, and a long
and wonderful retinue, and a clatter and
crash of the populace, accomplished by
means of many bells, not one of which
jangled in tune, and tin -horns and a thou
sand strange devices for splitting into
jagged fragments all tho atmosphere of
San Jose. Truly Old King Cole made a
wild night of it, and if there be one of his
subjects to-morrow who may not boast of
a remarkable headache it will be because
he has overdone the thing and is dead.
Queen Lillian pave over peacefully, for
her mission was simply merry-making and
a display of the beauty of her realm. At
the approach of riot she fled.
All day tne minions of the King gath
ered and increased in the streets, hidden
behind masks and cloaks, and when the
sun went down and before the lights were
lit they came in crowds out of every
shadow in the street. San Jose has not
seen the like before. The city is crowded
to-night beyond any previous experience,
and it was only with the greatest diffi
culty that people made progress through
the streets in the early part of the even
ing, while awaiting the coming of the
merry monarch and his army. The riot
ous and noisy subjects held possession of
the middle of the road supposed to be re
served for him. With his approach they
fell back and with their frightful crash of
horns and bells made way for him.
The King was late. He gave his people
i notice that he would come among them at
7 in the evening, but it is understood that
he stopped outside the gates to take an
other bumper with a few friends and for
got his date. At any rate, it was running
on past 9 o'clock when his Majesty swag
j gered into First street.
Throughout the whole day there had
been plotting and counter plotting in and
out of the royal family. There was even a
scheme to kidnap his Majesty and hidÂ©
him away from his people in the midst of
his brief reign. But the King heard of it
and the plotters were placated with posi
tions in the cabinet. The tardiness of
the King made his people very nervous, in
view of the rumors that everybody had
heard, and they blew their horns and
jangled their cow bells more discordantly
as the time passed.
However, he came in great glory with
his trolley on, supplying light to a bower
of incandescent lamps in which he sat.
On the moving throne with him were his
fiddlers three and those members of the
royal family who are always supposed to
"keep next" to kings.
The line of march began at the Hotel
Vendome, moved down First street to

went out and the Chinamen refused to
move until it was relighted, and such a
long pause took place in the street that it
was within less Than an hour of midnight
before the King arrived at the pavilion.
A throng had already gathered there and
dancing had begun. His Majesty com
posed himself on his throne with his pipe
in his mouth and the people grew still
while his minister published his for
mal salutation, wishing them well and
bidding them go forward and have fun.
No sooner had he done so than a mob of
plotters against the throne, led by "Jim"
Rea, in the name of the order of American
Freemen rushed upon the stage and with
drawn swords demanded a series of re
markable reforms and concessions to peo
ple. The chief councilor of the American
Freemen, John E. Richards, presented the
matter formally by petition, as follows:
The demand of the chief of the Order of
American Freemen and hia loyal followers
upon hie Majesty, "Old King Cole," and the
royal family:
Firstâ We demand an investigation Into the
financial and the domestic affairs of the king
dom, and especially oi the royal household.
Secondâ We demand that the following
treasonable and peace-disturbing members of
the royal family, to wit: Howell C. Moore, S
N. Rucker, H. H. Main, C. W. Williams and
Franklin Hitchborn, be led to immediate exe
cution without benefit of clergy in the pres
ence of the assembled multitude, and that
their bodies be suspended from the rafters of
the royal palace, there lo remain as a terrible
example to like evil-doers so long as the king
dom shall endure.
Th rdâ We demand a royal edict establish
ing the Order of American Freemen among
the permanent institutions of the kingdom,
and conferring upon James W. Rea the per
i>etual office oi commander-in-chieX of the
order, with absolute power over its members,
Including the right to recruit its membership
by draft or conscription during political cam
paigns.
Fourthâ We demand a decree ordaining that
every other order and particularly the A. P. A.
and the x. M. I. shall surrender their charters,
and that the members of such orders shall
take an immediate oath of allegiance to the
commandtr-in-chief ol the Order of American
Freemen.
Fifthâ We demand that hereafter no corpo
ration, society., church or newspaper shall
have the right to do business within the royal
domain without first obtaining a license to do
so from the commander-in-cQief of the Order
of American Freemen.
Sixthâ We demand the promulgation of a
permanent sentence oi outlawry against all
Silurians, croakers, cranks and bigots, within
the royal domain. and that in the commander
in-chief of the Order of American Freemen
shall be reposed the power to determine who
belongs to the above category, and thereupon
to offer a suitable reward for their immediate
delivery to the lord high executioner of the
kingdom for such punishment as will fit the
Crime.
Seventhâ We demand an unlimited credit in
the royal treasury, to be drawn upon by the
commander-in-chief of the Order of American
Freemen whenever In his Judgment it may be
necessary for the good ol the oraer.
The King in reply indignantly denied
the several demands for an invest igatsion
and also the surrender of the four members
of the royal family, but compromised on
Franklin Hitchborn whom, he said, he
would surrender, and the petitioners
might do with him as they would. The
Freemen accepted this as satisfactory and
while they cried "Long live King Cole!"
the curtain rolled down amid the plaudits
of the people.
The dance of the merry maskers was re
sumed, and such is the gpirit of carnival
abroad that it is likely to continue long
into the early hours of Sunday morning.
The king and the royal family sallied out
upon the floor among the people and were
good fellows all.

AT THE CYCLING PARK.
Eight Thousand People See Some
bxciting Races.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 9.â Eight thou
sand people passed through the gates at
the Garden City Cyclers' track to-day, and
about 1000 small boys crawled under or
over the fences to witness the National
circuit bicycle races; and they were well
repaid for their trouble, for the meet was
one of the best ever held in thil State.
The races were all fast and exciting, and
the high class of the men who rode made
the events doubly interesting. In the pro
fessional events this was particularly true,
for such cracks as Wells, Coulter, Long,
Terrill, Jones, Edwards, Osen, McFarland,
and a dozen others of equal ability as
racers, were brought together, and their
finishes of the races were fast and desper
ate.
The audience was made up largely of
ladies. They outnumbered the men five
to one, and their bright faces and cos
tumes made the grand stand a very pretty
sight. The inside of the tracK was lined
witn carriages and the immense crowd oc
cupied every place of vantage obtainable.
There was one thine that regular race-
meet goers noticed, and that was tne ab
sence of Announcer Knapp, without whom
no race meeting Stems complete. He was
present, but did not officiate in his usual
capacity, owing to his indisposition from
some throat trouble. Mr. Tompkins of
San Jose took his place and Knapp stayed
around the press stand and helped "Jim
my" Joyce and ''Bob" Lennie make things
pleasant for the press and the judges.
The races were scheduled for 1:30, but it
was 2 o'clock before they started. Mean
while Roncovieri's band discoursed popu
lar airs, and no one minded the delay.
There were several falls during the
races, but aside from a few bruises no one
was hurt. Wells, Jones and Foster went
down in a heap in one event, but fortu
nately escaped injury.
The sport commenced with a one-mile
novice race in five beats and a final. The
winners of the heats and second in the
fastest heat, who qualified for the final,
were I. L. Rider, R. Shearman and P. M.
Curtis, Garden City; W. W. Fairar, Gil
roy. and W. F. Armstrong and D. E. Fran
cis unattached. The race was won by the
three Garden City men in one, two, three
order, Curtis, Ryder and Shearman finish
ing in front. The time was. 2:37 2-5.
The Btart of the two-thirds mile scratch,
professional, awakened considerable en
thusiasm in tne audience, and as the
various men came on the track they were
loudly applauded. The race was divided
into three heats, eight starters in each. In
the first heat the line-up was: Byrne, Im
perial; Wilbur Edwards, Garden City;
Jones and Davis, Olympic; Pickard,
Acme; Terrill and Hatton, Bay City.
Edwards set the pace the first lap, and
Hatton the second. In the sprint for
home Edwards drew away from the
bunch, winning by about five yards.
Jones, Byrne and Terrill followed in the
order named. The time was 1 :30 4-5.
In the second heat were: Coulter,
Olympic; Wells and Long:, Bay City;
Parker and Evans, Michigan- Osen,
Olympic, and Stayer, Portland. The pace
was not as speedy as the first heat. Long
fell at the end of the first lap, but was not
hurt. He claimed a loul and it was al
lowed, thus placing him in the final.
Coulter and Wells fought it out at the
tape, finishing in tnat order. Time,
1:38 1-5; Osen was third.
The thira heat brought out Campbell,
Cushine and Dow, Garden City; Foster
and J. E. Edwards. Olympic; McFarland,
San Jose; McCrea, Bay City, and Winsett
of Washington. The pace was hot and
the finish very exciting. Five of the men
finished almost abreast, and it took the
judges some time to make their decision.
The heat was given to Campbell, Foster
second. Time. 1 :36 3-5. McCrea and Mc-
Farland were right on top of them, inches
behind.
This brought into the final heat some of
the crack professionals of the world, and
as speedy an aggregation as ever faced a
starter's pistol. The line-up from the tape
was Edwards, Campbell, Coulter, Foster
Jones, Wells and Long.
Oscar Osen was put in to pace the race
thus insuring fast time. At the start Osen
jumped out and the rest sprinted after
him, Edwards being the first to tack on.
Round the track they flew at a killing
pace, and before they had gone a half
lap Jones fell, brineing down Foster and
Wells with him. The fall was caused by
Campbell, who was excited and rode
wildly. The others kept on, and on the
last turn Edwards jumped the pacemaker
and won by a few inches, Coulter being a
close second. The time was 1:28 3-5. It
was a pretty race, anl but for the unfortu
nate fall, which threw three good men out
of it, would have been more interesting.
The two-thirds mile handicap amateur
was run in four heats, first and second in
each heat and lastest third competing in
final. There were a dozen starters in each
heat, with handicaps varying from noth
ing to ninety-five yards. J. E. Willouphbv
of Watsonville won the first heat from
forty yards' handicap in 1:M 1-5. Down
ing. Garden City, made a good ride from
scratch and finished second, and A. J.
Clark of Mountain View was third. Motti
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 10, 1896.
Reliance; Delmas, Garden City, and Car
rol), San Jose, finished almost abreast in
the second heat, and the judges decided it
in that order. Mott's time was 1:26 4-5
from twenty-five yards.
The next heat was also largely in favor
of the Reliance Club. Gooch won it from
60 yards, in 1:24 1-5; Sherman, Los Gatos,
second, 60 yards; Yeoman, Reliance, third,
from 25 yards.
The fourth heat went to the San Jose
Road Club, Harden brook, 40 yards, and
Wing, 60 yards, taking first and second
respectively, in 1:23 2-5. The Reliance
Club, not to be denied, took third by Bates,
from 20 yards.
The final was a pretty ride, and the
bunch seemed to cross the tape almost
abreast. The judges gave the race to
Wing. Hardenbrook second. Downing
third. Wing's time was 1:26 2-5 from 60
yards.
The mile handicap, professional, was
probably the best event of the day. There
were twenty-two crack "proÂ« r> entered,
and the race was run in two heats, the
first four in each heat and fifth in the
fastest heat qualifying for the final. In
tue first h at there were Foster and Wells,
scratcli; McFarland, 30 yards; J. E. Ed
wards, 40; Long and Osen, 4s; Hatton, 50;
Jones. 55; Evans, 65; Dow, 75, and Parker,
80 yarde.
It took the scratch men two laps to
catch the bunch, the pace was so fast, and
they were then too tired to enter the final
sprint. Osen won in 2:11 2-5. McFtirland,
Edwards, Dow and Evans following in the
order named, close up, all qualifying for
the final.
The starters in the second heat were:
Coulter, scratch. McCrea. 20 yards, Camp
bell 40. Terrell 55, Davis, Scheiski and
Winsett 60, Stayer 65, Cushing 75, and
Byrne 85. Wilbur Edwards was also
entered, but did not start as he wished to
save himself for a trial against time later,
paced by a sextuplet.
Coulter caught the limit men on the first
lap and had it easy the rest of the way.
He was unable to sprint at the finish.
however, and finished back with the ruck.
Schefski won from sixty yardstin 2:16 3-5.
The order following him was Winsett,
Stayer, Davis and Cashing.
This brought into the final: Osen, Mc-
Farland, J. Edwards, Dow, Evans, Schef
eki, "WinÃett, Stayer and Davis, all on
handicap marks. None of the scratch
men had qualified in their heats, and this
left McFarland the virtual scratch man
on the thirty-yard mark.
The pace was hot from the Btart. Osen
fell on the first lap, but was unhurt.
Schefski had the same experience on the
second. Coming down the stretch Mc-
Farland had the lead and kept it winning
in 2:20 2-5, J. E. Edwards was second.
Winsett third.
The last race of the day was a one-mile
scratch amateur event, in three heats and
a final, first in each heat and fastest second
to qualify. The starters in the first heat
were: Metcalf, Imperial; Belloli, San
Jose; Bates and Yeoman, Reliance; Wil
loughby, Pajaro, and Delmas, Garden
City. It wasa close finish between Delmas
Willougbby and Belloli, and they were
placed In that order. Time, 2:27.
In the second beat were: R. Shearman
and 11. Downing, Garden City; G. Fuller
Olympic; J. J. Carroll, San Jose, and C.
D. Gooch, Reliance. Downing was easily
the best man in the heat and won by
yards ip 2:37 2-5. Fuller was second.,
Shearman third.
Freeman, Bay City; Mott and Boyden,
Reliance; Crafts. Acme, and Wing, San
Jose, rode the third heat. Mott, who is a
plucky little rider and very popular with
the audience at race meets, won by a bare
margin from Crafts in 2:40 1-5.
The final was paced by G. Hardenbrook
and J. C. Smith, of the Garden City
Cyclers, on a tandem. The pace of the
tandem was too fast for the riders, and it
soon drew away from them. The men
rode it out unpaced, Downing winning in
2:24 4-5, Mott second, Delmas third.

Clara* Capital.
CHICO, Cal., May 9.â The Mayday cele
bration, postponed to to-day because of a
storm on May 1, was held to-aay. Since
early morning the streets have been
crowded. From lowlands and mountains
have come the roisterers. Hundreds of
little tots, dressed in all the colors ot the
rainbow, happy in the possession of pop
corn and candy, added life to the throng.
Merchants and business men â in fact all
the people of this pretty town â have had
but one thought, and that was to make
this day the most enjoyable to the people
of the surrounding country. The stores
and banks were decorated in brilliant col
ors of red, white and blue. The celebra
tion owes its success to the able manage
ment of the executive committee, com
posed of the leading merchants and busi
ness men.
The parade was the most imposing one
that has been seen here in many years.
The marshal of the day, O. L. Clark, with
his gayly decorated steed, and the fine
looking young men who acted as his aids,
were admired by the youne ladies. The
military and the firemen made a fine ap
pearance. - f
The central attractions in the grand pa- !
rade were the hadso-uie Queen of May, Miss
Clara Cussick, and her lovely maids of
honor, Miss Frieda Junkans and Miss Bes
sie Collins. The queen was dressed in
cream brocaded satin, fnll circular skirt.

Xative Daughter* Entertain Uuestt From
Surrounding Citie*.
LODI, Cal., May 9.â The Native Daugh
ters of Lodi gave their floral festival last
night, and it was repeated this even
ing with much success. The decorations
throughout the building in which the af
fair was held were characterized by a pro
fusion of beautiful flowers and streaming
greenery. Ivy Parlor is the name of the
Lodi society of Native Daughters, and the
pretty vine after which the parlor was
christened was given prominence in the
ornamentation.
Delegations attended from Stockton,
from Acampo, New Hope, San Andreas,
Lockeford and all the surrounding towns.
The Stockton parlor of .Native Daughters
sent a quantity of flowers to aid their sis
ters of the watermelon center. The vari
ous booth were beautifully decorated, calls
lilies playing a prominent part in the
signs above the booths calling attention to
the wares the pretty girls of Lodi were
vending. During the evening a pro
gramme of music and sone was rendered
for the benefit of the hundreds who
thronged the pavilion.
Twenty-two of the Native Daughters of
Stockton, with many of their friends, at
tended the fiesta in a body to-night. After
tne programme had been concluded danc
ing was indulged in until a late hour. The
local Native Daughters are much pleased
over the success of their venture, but the
guests who attended the floral display last
night and to-night are still more so.

RESWOODS JUVENILE CARNIVAL.
Children Crown a Queen and Conduct a
Parade.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., May 9.â A juve
nile carnival at Kenwood, in Loa Guilicos
Vailey, was the novel entertainment
offered by the school children of that dis
trict to-day. It was given under the
auspices of the Little Mite Society of Ken
wood.
Every feature was strictly up to date,
even the election of a queen by ballot.
Miss Dora Anderson, a pretty little miss
not yet in her teens, having received over
1000 votes, each of which cost the voter a
nickel, was crowned with a wreath in the
Pillion at the springs to-day.
There was a grand parade of decorated
carnages from the Kenwood church to
the springs, and after the coronation cere
monies were over, the Mayday custom of
a dance around the many-colored May
pole amused the little ones. A basket
picnic ended the caruival, the most enjoy
able of all the Sonoma County flower
shows.

In conversation with a representative of
the United Press he said: 'There is no
question about the Oregon Short Line

make but little change, I hope. I believe
that the Union Pacific will virtually con
trol the road. I think that the general

most desirable man, I believe, to all par

WHITE'S FIGHT
FOR SUN PEDRO,
Its Natural Advantages as
a Deep-Sea Harbor
Explained.
PRACTICAL MEN QUOTED
''In Every Way Santa Monica's
Superior," Says the Cali
fornia Senator.
WILL SUBMIT TO A TRIBUNAL.
A Competent anl Impartial Board, to
Be Selected by Congress, Is
Suggested.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 9.-The
greater part of to-day's session of the
Senate was occupied by White of Cali
fornia in setting out the advantages pos
sessed by San Pedro over Santa Monica
for a deep water harbor on the coast of
Southern California. His argument is to
be answered on Monday by Frye of Maine
as chairman of the Committee on Com
merce, which has incorporated in the river
and harbor bill a large appropriation for
Santa Monica.
It has been suggested, White said,
that through an esprit de corps the
second board of army engineers had co
incided with the first, and therefore he
and his colleague had prepared the
amendment which he had proposedâ to
let the appropriation be made and to refer
the determination of the issue between the
two points to an admittedly impartial
tribunalâ a tribunal created under some
regulations prescribed by Congress. He
was not committed irrevocably to the plan
proposed in his amendment.
He only wished a board composed of
persons of intelligence, of capacity, and
without partialityâ a board to which both
sides could look with confidence and on
whose judgment and impartiality men de
sirous of doing right would be wining to
rely. But the friends of the other side, he
said, declined to accept that offer because
they knew that no impartial and compe
tent tribunal would decide in their favor.
They boldly and without excuse proposed
to overturn and cast aside those to whose
recommendations they should at least
award decent consideration and to ratify
and carry out the engagements made by
the employes of Mr. Huntington with
him, and enable them to go before him
and to offer at bis feet the great winnings
which they had made from the Govern
ment of the United States.
White read from the report of the hear
ings before the Committee on Commerce a
synopsis of the affidavits made by captains
of vessels, going to show that the natural
advantages of San Pedro were in every
way superior to those of Santa Monica,
particularly as to the character of anchor
age. These affidavits, White said, were
made by practical men, not by theorists â
men who had cast their anchors in that
roadstead and who knew what they were
talking about. White also quoted from
the Craighill report, showing points of
vantage possessed by San Pedro beyond
those of Sauta Monica.
The town of Santa Monica he described
as a very delightful bathing-place, fre
quented by thousands of people, and he
said that a considerable number of rail
road tracks between the sea line and the
bluff, where there is now one track owned
by the Southern Pacific Company, would
be absolutely destructive to the place so far
as its present uses are concerned.
White also quoted from statements of
Colonel Haines and Major Raymond of
the engineer corps, unfavorable to Santa
Monica, and said: "We are here, I pre
sume, to enact a law providing for an ap
propriation to be expended for some useful
purpose, and under conditions where suc
cess would be reasonably assured. We
are not here for experiments."
On the other side of the question, White
had read by the clerk a long extract from
the report of Lieutenant H. C. Taylor of
the United States navy in favor of Santa
Monica, but White's comment upon it was
that there was an air of partisanship
about it.
The opposite view from Lieutenant Tay
lor was taken by Professor Davidson of the
United States Coast Survey, and he had
an extract from Professor Davidson's re
port read, saying that it was very valuable
from an expert point of view.
At the close of White's speech Frye (R.)
of Maine, chairman of the Committee on
Commerce, said that he was expected to
present alone the side of the committee,
but he deemed it fair, as other Senators
were to speak on the same side as White,
that he (Frye) should have the close.
Peffer (Pop.) of Kansas favored San
Pedro. He read the conclusions of the
Mendell board, to the effect that San
Pedro was the best place for the deep
water harbor, and the indorsement of its
report by General Casey, who transmitted
it to the Senate in January. 1893. He
thought it the duty of Congress, if it fol
lowed any advice, to follow the advice of
the two boards of army officers especially
appointed to examine the question.
At this point Stewart (Pop.) of Nevada
suggested that as the Senate was very
thin, and as the chairman of the Commit
tee on Commerce, Frye, desired to make
his reply to a fuli Senate, the bill go over
till Monday, and that suggestion was
agreed with.
The Senate then proceeded to the con
sideration of unobjected bills. Among
those passed were the following: Senate
bills concerning the weight of evidence in
pension claims, providing that the testi
mony of a private or non-commissioned
officer shall not have less weight than that
of a commissioned officer; providing that
the absence of an honorable discharge
shall not debar a man from a pennon, pro
vided there is no charge of desertion
against him; to lease to the city of Bis
marck, N. Dak., S bley Island, in the Mis
souri River, for pudic purposes; to vacate
Sugarloaf reservoir site, in Colo
rado and to restore the lands therein
to entry at $2 50 per acre; extending the
time within which the University of
Utah shall occupy lands heretofore
granted to it; appropriating $10,000 for a
statue or Commodore John D. Sloat in
Monterey, Cal.; prohibiting physicians
from giving informa^on confidential in
its nature in regard to patients; appro
priating $300,000 for a Dublic building at
Butte City, Mont.
A bill for the construction of a cable and
telegraph line from the United States to
Siberia, Japan and the Hawaiian Islands
and to guarantee interest on the bonds
was Introduced by Wilson (R.) of Wash
ington and referred to the Committee on
Commerce.
A joint resolution, authorizing the em
ployment of counsel for the purpose of
bringing suits against the directors and
stockholders of the Union and Central Pa
cific Railroad Companies, was offered by
Pettigrew (R.) of South Dakota, and laid
on the table for the present, Pettiprew
stating that he desired to address the Sen
ate on the subject.
Stewart (Pop.) of Nevada asked and
obtained leave to have printed in the
Record, as part of his remarks, a paper en
titled, "A National Platform for the
American Independents of 1896," proposed
by William P. St. John, president of the
Mercantile National Bank of New York.
"For which party is it intended?"
Mitchell (R.) of Orejron asked.
"For some independent party," was
Stewart's reply.
Morrill (R.) o f Vermont, chairman of
the Finance Committee, offered a resolu
tion, which was referred to the Committee
on Contingent Expenses, authorizing the
Finance Committee to refer the "bond in
vestigation" to a sub-committee.
Dubois (R.) of Idaho introduced Â»nd
asked immediate consideration for a joint
resolution providing that no bonds shall
be issued under any existin-r law until the
President shall have communicated to
Congress in a message the facts showing
the necessity for such issue of bonds and
the amount required for such purpose,
and until Congress shall by law have
authorized such bonds to be paid.
Tne joint resolution was laid on the
table for the present, and at 5 o'clock the
Senate adjourned until Monday.
The Hquse was not in session to-day.
A MILL ION IN SMOKE.
An Item That Ha* Annoyed the Treatury
Canhter for litany Year*.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 9.â A Sun spe
cial from Washington says: The books of
the United States Treasury carry an item
of 11,000,000 which represents United States
notes which are supposed to have been
consumed in the great Chicago fire twenty
five years ago. It is known that there was
$1,000,000 of currency, more or less, in the
vaults of the sub-treasury then, and that
none of it was recovered, but the denomi
nations of these notes and the exact
amount are unknown, as the books of the
cashier were consumed also.
There could not have been, however,
very many dollars less or very marry dol
lars more than one million, and it would
simplify the accounts of the treasury and
save a treat deal or labor to the bookkeep
ers if Congress should pass a bill or reso
lution recognizine the fact that this money
Is no longer in existence, for every day
when the cashier in the treasury balances
his accounts be has to include this item,
deducting it or adding it as the case may
be fora the amount in hand. It appear?
upon every daily, weekly, monthly and
yearly statement of the assets and liability
of the Government as "unknown destroyed
United States notes, $1,000,000."
To Amend the Late.
WASHINGTON, D. C. May 9.-In the
Senate to-day Mr. Peffej (Pop.) of Kansas
introduced a bill to aftiend the internal
revenue law so as to provide that the pay
ment of any tax imposed by the United
States revenue laws for carrying on any
business shall not exempt "any person
from any penalty provided oy the laws of
any State for carrying on the same within
such State, or to authorize such business
contrary to the laws of such State, or in
any place prohibited by municipal law.

AN ASSIGNMENT,
Failure of Schumacher, the
Oatmeal King of
Ohio.
TOO MANY ENTERPRISES
Owes a Million and a Half, but
Creditors Will Be Paid
in Full.
ALL PROPERTY TURNED OVER.
The Pressed Millionaire Was a Noted
Prohibitionist and Once Ran
for Governor.
ARKON, Ohio, May 9.â Ferdinand Schu
macher, the millionaire oatmeal king,
president of the American Cereal Com
pany of Chicago, the Schumacher Gym
nasium Company of this city, the Mar
seilles Land and Water Power Company,
the Illinois River Paper Company of Mar
seilles, 111., and the Tennessee Land Com
pany of Harriman, Term., assigned at 4
o'clock this afternoon. The liabilities are
estimated at $1,500,000 and the assets at
$3,000,000. The assignment was a volun
tary one.
Until three years ago Mr. Schumacher
was a resident of Akron, at which time he
removed to Chicago. When the American
Cereal Company was organized he entered
the combine and was elected president,
which position he occupied and has since
held. The failure was caused by his heavy
losses in the two companies at Marseilles,
which assigned this morning. In order to
save these companies Mr. Schumacher
borrowed $800,000 from Akron, Cleveland
and Massachusetts banks. $200,000 of which
would become due this month.
The greater portion of this amount could
not be renewed nor could Mr. Schumacher
raise the mo#ey to pay the discounts on
the notes. Yesterday he called his attor
ney, Johnston H. Arbogast, and his
nephew, Hugh Schumacher, to Chicaeo,
and his financial condition was carefully
examined. Late yesterday he decided to
assign for the benefit of his creditors, and
a trust deed conveying all his property to
Johnston Arbogast and Hush Schumacher
was prepared. This was filed in this city
to-day.
The property turned over for the benefit
of his creditors consists of $1,000,000 worth
of stock in the American Cereal Company,
$4n,000 worth of stock in the Schumacher
'ivmnasinm Company, the Clarendon Ho
tel and his residence in this city, besides a
large amount of real estate in and about
Akron. Altogether, the property turned
over is estimated at $2,000,000. At the
same time the deed in trust was filed a
cWd in trust by the Schumacher Gymna
sium Company was a!.Â«o filed. The assets
of this company are estimated at $40,000,
with ti-e liabilities much in exesss.
About six years ago Mr. Schumacher
founded Harriman, Term. He is a strict
prohibitionist, and founded the city on the
same principles. The result was he lost
nearly $500,000 in the transaction. Twelve
years ago he was the candidate on the
Prohibition ticket for Governor of Ohio.
J. A. Arbogast, one of the assignees, paid
to-night that if the property is not sold at
a forced sale the creditors will realize dol
lar for dollar, but if the property was sold
they would lose heavily, as there is no
market for it just as present. But one
mortgaee was riled by Mr. Schumacher.
That was for $35,000 and given to twenty
creditors, jointly, who held claims aggre
gating $5500 to $7000 against Schumacher.
OTTAWA, 111., May 9.â Careful investi
gation fails to show a cause for the $1,000,
000 failure of the Marseilles Land and
Water Power Company and the Illinois
River Paper Company at Marseilles, out
side the general break-up of Fred Schu
macher at Arkon, Ohio, he being the prin.
cipal owner of both places at Marseilles.
His investment in the little city con
sisted of the control of the finest water
power plant in the State, the largest straw
board mill in the world, the Crescent mill,
a wood pulp mill, an electric light plant
and coal mines. On account of the general
business depression none of these had
prospered the past two years, but his losses
in them were not extensive.
THE LOUISANA GOVERNORSHIP.
Trouble Anticipated Wiien the Legiala.
ttere Meets To-JUorrovc.
NEW YORK, N. V.. May 9.â A Snn
special from New Orleans says : A com
mittee consisting of 100 of the leading
! men of New Orleans was ap
pointed yesterday to try and arrange a
settlement of the gubernatorial troubles
and prevent a conflict at the State Capitol
when the Legislature meets on Monday or
when the vote for Governor is counted on
Thuraday. The returns show the re-elec
tion of Foster, Democrat, by a majority of
27,000, but Pharr, the Republican candi
date, asserts that gro<-s frauds have been
perpetrated and that he will carry his con
test before the Legislature and demand an
investigation of the vote.
T ;e Legislature consists of 64 straight
Democrats, 17 members of the Citizens'
League, a reform organization of New Or
leans whirh defeated the Democracy in
that city, t'l Populists and 21 Republicans,
showing a Democratic majority of four
over all.
At one time it looked as if there would
be an armed conflict at Uaton Rouge, and
the militia was ordered to hold itself in
readiness to go to Baton Rouge, but the
chances of violence are now considered
slight, and both sides seem disposed to
leave the matter to the Legislature. The
committee of citizens proposes that ti e
Legislature before counting the vote for
Governor shall pass a new election law and
call h Constitutional Convention which
will limit the suffrage by an educational
qualification and omer a new election
alter this has been done. The Republi
cans have accepted the offer, but Governor
Foster will probably refuse.
WRANGLE OVER INSTRUCTIONS.
The Jackron Murder Case Not let Before
the Jury.
CINCINNATI. Ohio, May 9. â The
Jackson case is not yet in the hands of the
jury, nor l.aye thearmimenti commenced.
It was evidently expected that the jury
would receive its instructions from the
court to-day, but w en couit opened in
the morning Jud^eHelm was not ready
and an adjournment wan taken until 2
o'clock.
Judge Helm had prepared a series of
sixteen instructions to the jury, to several
of which Colonel Crawford took exception.
During the noon hour Colonel Crawford
had prepared five instructions, which he
wished included in the list, but the court
excluded them. The whole of the after
noon was taken up in discussing tie in
structions, and the oniy time the jury was
brought in was shortly before the evening
adjournment, when it was instructed not
to discuss the case.
Several copies of the instructions had
pot out among the reporters, which
judge Helm regretted. He s-aid that the
oopies given out would be modttied, and
would not be the final instructions given
to tie jury.
A loiii; wrangle between the court and
Colonel Crawford over the instructions
consumed the entire afiernoon.

TO SUE STOCKHOLDERS,
Senator Pettigrew's Bill to Se
cure Money From the
Pacific Roads.
It Also Directs the Attorney-General
to Foreclose on the Government
Liens.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 9.-Senator
Pettigrew to-day introduced a joint reso
lution requesting President Cleveland to
employ counsel for the purpose of bring
ing suits against the directors and stock
holders of the Union and Central Pacific
railroads who received the stock of said
roads without paying cash for the same;
also to recover from the directors, officers
and stockholders of said roads such
sums of money as were stolen by
them or diverted and converted to un
lawful purposes *nd therefore not
placed in the sinking fund as required by
law, and the President is authorized to
pay to the attorneys the sum of 5 per cent
of all sums received from the directors or
stockholders. The Attorney-General is
also directed to foreclose the mortgage of
the Government on such roads at the ear
liest possible date, and to take steps to pay
off the prior incumbrance on said roads
and to use the sinking fund for that pur
pose; to ascertain the amount of money
belonging to the Union and Central Pacific

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 10, 1896.
FIGHTING AGAINST
FUTURES IN GRAIN.
Agrarian Leaders to Follow
Up the Blow at the
System.
BUSINESS TRANSFERRED
Operators Will Desert Berlin for
Quarters at Amsterdam and
Antwerp.
THE REFORM OF THE MILITARY
Civil and Military Cabinets of Em
peror William Are Yet in
Opposition.
BERLIN, Germany, May 9.â The lead
ers of the Agrarian party in the Reichstag
have declared their intention to follow up
the blow they dealt against the system of
trafficking in grain futures by proposing
that judgments obtained in other than
German courts arising from disputes grow
ing out of time deals in grain shall not be
enforced in Germany. As international
execution of judgments are regulated by
international laws and treaties any mere
deliverance of the Reichsiag upon this
subject must necessarily remain inopera
tive. The action of the Reichstae in pro
hibiting dealings in futures has led a num
ber ot operators to transfer their grain
transactions to Amsterdam and Antwerp.
Some dealers say that the prohibition of
time deals will not affect business in the
least, as they could carry on future deals
in Chicago or New York independently of
the rules of the Berlin Produce Exchange,
and, though such contracts would not be
legally binding, the dealers say they can
rely upon the good faith of the contrartins:
parties. Several leadme firms, whose
heads are members of the Produce Ex
change, are arranging In conjunction with
a number of Hamburg houses to establish
grain-trade banks in Antwerp, Amster
dam and Brussels. To counteract this
movement Count yon Kanitz, the Agrarian
leader, has given notice in the Reichstag
of his intention to ask the Government to
negotiate with foreign powers for the con
clusion of treaties prohibiting traffic in
grain and produce futures.
The Hanover Courier asserts that the
term of office of the Imperial Chancellor,
Prince Hohenloh*, will end with the close
of the present session of the Reichstag,
but the semi-official press, on the contrary,
declares that a ministerial crisis haa been
averted and that Prince Hohenlohe will
remain in power as lone as his health per
mits.
General Bronsart yon FchelJendorf, Im
perial Minister of War, has succeeded in
obtaining the Emperor's assent to the
scheme for the reform of the mil'tary tri
bunals and also certain reforms in the
army organization which have long been
oppoÃed by the Emperor's military cabi
net. The Chancellor and the Minister of
War will continue their struggle against
the influence of General yon Hahnke, the
chief of the Emperor's military cabinet,
and Dr. yon Lucanus, chief of the Kaiser's
civil cabinet, and if they should be suc
cessful it ought to lead to a chance in the
personnel of both the military and civil
cabinets.
Another Colonial Office scandal is excit
ing political and official circles. Baron
yon Wissmann, the Governor of German
East Africa, who sailed from Zanzibar last
Thursday on his way home, does not in
tend to return to bis post, and as a matter
of fact threatens to leave the imperial
service. He has had a quarrel with the au
thorities of the Colonial Office over the ap
pointment to his staff of a certain Herr
yon Eitz, who was associated with the re
cent accusations made against Dr. Carl
Peters, the explorer,
Eugene Wolff, the explorer, in an ar
ticle in the Berlin Tageblatt, makes a
sharp attack upon the Colonial Office au
thorities for their action in sending Lieu
tenant Werther on a mission to East Af
rica to explore a supposed region of gold
reefs.
In 1893 Herr Wolff directed the attention
of the Colonial Office to Werther's conduct,
abuse of power and exactions while he was
at the head of a geological research expe
dition in Africa. Toe Colonial Office
authorities iv respect to this asked Wolff
to keep silent about the matter and
assured him that Werther would never
again be similarly engaged by the Colonial
Office. Herr Woiff now protests against
Werther's second mission and declares
that there is no gold in the regions which
be has gone to explore. The whole
matter, Herr Wolff maintains, is a job.
The blindness of the Grand Duke of
Mecklenburg-Strelitz led him into a dan
gerous predicament last Wednesday while
on his way to the horse fair at New Bran
denburg. As he was being led across a
railroad track his foot became caught in
the rails and could not be extricated.
The consequence was that be was forced
to remain standing for some time in the
middle of the line, over which there was a
very large traffic, owing to the horse fair,
and the trains had to be brought to a stand
still by the signalmen until the Grand
Duke'Â« foot was finally released by its
being forced out of bis boot.
The Empress on the occasion of the
birthday of Crown Prince William, who
was 14 years old last Wednesday, paid a
visit to the Crown Prince and his brother,
Prince Eitel Frederick, at Ploen, where
they are at school, returning to Berlin
Wednesday evening.
Last evening the Emperor and Empress
gave a dinner to the chiefs of the German
Red Cross Society in commemoration of
the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founda
tion of tho society and were afterward
present at a gala opera performance in
honor of the occasion. To-day the Em
peror and Empress started for Frankfort
and will visit the International Flower
Exhibition at Dresden en route.

THE CRATER OF
MOKUAWEOWEO,
Boiling Lake of Lava Found
by a Venturesome
Hawaiian.
A SCENE OF GRANDEUR
Fountains of Molten Matter Are
Spouting Hundreds of Feet
Into the Air.
SURPASSING EVEN XILATJEA.
Now There Is a Great Rush of
Tourists to See the Greatest
of Eruptions.
HONOLULU. Hawaii, May I.â Volcano
news is the principal topic of conversation
here to the exclusion of politics, the Legis
lature and almost everything else. No di
rect news from the crater itself has been
received until about two hours since, when
the Kinau arrived from her usual run to
ports on Hawaii.
Purser George Beckley of that vessel
says that a telephone message was re
ceived at Hilo just before the Kinau
started to the effect that a native had
Jeft for the scene of the outbreak on
Monday last, the 27th, and had succeeded
in reaching the edge of the great crater
and obtained a very fair view of the new
eruption. He found a boiling lake of lava
in trie summit crater which was a good
two miles in diameter and extremely act
ive. Tbe lake was constantly rising, and
the indications of an overflow were immi
nent. He says the whole surface of the
lake presents a scene of grandeur impossi
ble to describe. There were fountains
spouting molten laya hundreds of feet
into the air, great turbulence over the
entire lake, and a display of seething,
surging lava such as he never saw before
in either Kilauea or Mokuaweoweo.
Purser Beckley says the glare in the sky
is continually increasing in brightness,
and there is no longer any doubt that the
great volcano is making up for its nine
years of quiescence.
The Kinau also brings news of the re
newed activity in the crater of Kilauea,
which broke out a few weeks ago, but after
ward subsided. Mr. Beckley Bays the
lake is rising rapidly, and the display is
eraud. It is thirty miles from the Volcano
House, at the Kilauea crater, to the big
volcano at the summit of Mokuaweoweo;
consequently the tourist eoing to tne lat
ter wilKsee the former first, as all expedi
tions for the summit outfit and start from
the Volcano House. As the road is rough
horses, packtraina and tents have to be
taken along, but all of these can be ob
tained of Manager Peter Lee, who is pre
pared for just such emergencies.
Every steamer and sailing vessel which
comes into port brings glowing accounts
of the grand view obtained at sea of the
volcano at night. Some idea of the ex
tent of the present eruption may be gained
from the fact that the glare is distinctly
visible after the moon goes down from
Diamond Head, the well-known landmark
near this city. The distance is over 200
miles from Honolulu, and when the wind
is blowing In this direction the Bmoke
from the volcano can be seen in this city.
A party of Honolulu people, consisting
of Daniel Logan, editor of the Bulletin,
F. S. Dodge of the Government Survey
Department, Rev. Dr. Dille of San Fran
cisco and D. Howard Hitchcock, a local
artist, left on the last trip of the Kinau,
and must be at the crater by this time, but
they have not yet been beard from. Mr.
Logan writes to his paper from Mahukona
that the view from that place at night is
grand in the extreme, and very much like
that of Vesuvius.
Mr. Hitchcock, the artist, sent rough
sketches of the scene at night and in the
daytime from Mahukona, thirty miles
away. It is the only authentic sketch
of the present outbreak which has yet
come to hand. The steamer W. G. Hall,
which sailed for Hawaii to-day, took quite
a number of tourists for the wonderful
sight.
A FFAIRS OF THE ISLANDS.
Princess Kaiulani Will Get the Pension
Granted.
HONOLULU, Hawai'. May ' 10.â The
f grant of $2000 a year pension to Princess
Kaiulani has become a law.
Julien D. Hayne of the Hawaiian Maga
zine married a rich widow last year in
Florida, professing to be a wealthy coffee
planter of twenty-five years' experience in
Hawaii. Her son, in Ohio, is trying to
learn Hayne's record, which is a mystery
up to three years ago. lie has learned that
Hayne insured his mother's life for $10,000,
and believes her to be in danger from him.
The son is taking measures for her pro
tection.
Damon's bill for refunding bonds was de
feated in the Senate by a vote of 7 to 6on
April 27. Capitalists are generally opposed
to the measure, being unwilling to lose so
convenient an investment for their surplus
dividends as Hawaiian bonds at G per cent.
The subject of a new loan for public im
provements is under active discussion in
the Senate. The only question is whether
to seek a low rate of interest in London,
allowing a large discount, or to place the
bonds in Honolulu at 6 per cent or a little
less. Local capitalists are hungry for the
latter arrangement as an investment for
the large sugar dividends now pouring in.

PORTLAND, Or., May 9.â W. L. Wil
liamson, representing the Horse Show
Association of the Pacific Coast, is in Port
land interesting Oregon owners of thor
oughbreds in plans for the next horse
show to be held at the Bay City. Mr.
Williamson is making a general tour of
the Pacific Coast and States, and is awak
ening horsemen to the fact that it will be
to their advantage to place their horses on
exhibition at the show in December. In
Portland Mr. Williamson has been meet
ing with very gratifying success, and a
number of owners of fine stock have signi
fied their willingness to co-operate with
tho managers in making the show a great
event.
The second annual hoise show, in De
cember of last year, proved to be such a
popular success that it was decided by the
board of directors that it should be made
more of a Pacific Coast horse show and less
of a California show. Mr. Williamson
says they will have 500 horses on exhibi
tion this year. He has been out to Irving,
ton Park and the Witch hazel farm look
ing at the high-steppers.

This is the second trial that
Sehorn has had on the charge of killing
Putnam. Tbe first jury failed to agree.
The Superior Judge of Colusa County has
been presiding in the case, and also the
Prosecuting Attorney of Colusa County.
The jury on the first ballot stood seven for
acquittal, two for manslaughter and three

REJOICING AT STANFORD.
Palo Altoans Pleased With the
Result of the Final Game
of Baseball.
Gratifying Record in Athletics Dur
ing the Year â Current Events at
the University.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., May
9.â The feeling of joy here over the result
of the last intercollegiate baseball game
yesterday is almost as great us after the
recent intercollegiate field-day. The base
ball game was by far the finest played b}
either team this semester. Stanford had
found that her continued supremacy was
likely to receive a rude shock and all stu
dents here felt a thrill of uneasiness when
the team left for San Jose. The result,
however, left no doubt in the minds of
anyone that, while the two teams are both
good, Stanford's is the superior. All tue
members of the team say that they were
forced to play their best game or meet with
defeat and they determined to win if hard
playing could do it.
With the track events at San Jose and
tbe baseball game athletics for the year are
over, so far as the two colleges are con
cerned. Never before ha 9 Stanford had
so many victories to her credit. In not a
single athletic event has she been defeated,
with the exception of the freshmen foot
ball game. On the other hand she can
point to four intercollegiate championship
victories, all won within the last two
months.
The seniors are making elaborate prepa
rations for their commencement week ex
ercises. The seniors' farce, entitled "An
Intercollegiate Affair," is behiÂ£ rehearsed
daily, and those in charge promise that it
will be the finest performance of its kind
ever Â«iven at Stanford. The farce itself is
said to be unusually clever and original
in its ie'eas and situations, while most of
[ those who will assume the several roles
have proved themselves decidedly clever
amatenrs. Another feature of the com
mencement week exercises will be the
sophomore freshmen peace-making. Tne
event is to be made more interesting this
year than last by the introduction of many
new ceremonies.
The zoological laboratory is in receipt of
another collection of tishes from Jamaica,
sent by a missionary â H. C. Robert-*. This
is the third collection sent by Mr. Roberts,
whose work is being done under the
auspices of the Hopkins fund. The new
collection is said to include several very
rare specimens of marine life.
Several collecting expeditions are to be
sent out from the university this summer.
Itutter and Schofield, two students, intend
to visit the most likely points in Alaska in
the interests of the laboratories, while
other students will work in the Northwest
States, making collections of fishes and
mammalia. It is quite possible that several
other expeditions will b9 formed later to
carry on work at promising points in
Western States.
Dr. Jordan stated to-day to a Call repre
sentative that the chair in law, left vacant
by the resignation of Professor Woodruff,
would not be filled this year. An assistant
would be appointed by Professor Abbott,
head of the department, to carry on the
work next year, but no appointment to the
chair would be ma<le until $4000 could be
offered to some first-rate law professor.
Anton .Schott, the German tenor, sang
here this evening. The Encina Gym
nasium was well filled to hear the artist.
A programme consisting entirely of Wag
nerian selections was rendered in a manner
that will never be forgotten by those
present. This was the second concert
niven here by Anton Schott during the
past three weeks.
INQUEST AT SAN LUIS.
Dr. Smith JUet His Death by Being
Thrown from a Horse.
SAN LUlti OBISPO, Cal., May 9.â The
evidence in the Coroner's inquest held
to ascertain the cause of the death of
Dr. F. H. Smith "returned a verdict that
deceased came to his death through in
juries received by a horse that he was
riding falling down with him.
A number of witnesses were examined
and there was nothing brought out which
indicated a murder. The verdict clears
the mystery of the case. Dr. Smith was
the dentist who was thrown from his horse
on t tie 29th of April while returning from
the barbecue of the Native Sons at Syca
more Springs. On account of the peculiar
fracture of the skull it was hard to believe
that it was sustained by a fall from his
horse, hence the action of the Coroner in
holding an investigation. The doctor rode
a lively horse, and in reining it up it
reared, falling over backward. There was
nothing in the testimony of the witnesses
to indicate that he was intoxicated at the
tin.c of the accident as was supposed.
The body was shipped to Philadelphia,
accompanied by the late doctor's wife.
Dr. Smith belonged to one of the leading
families of Philadelphia, who are quite
wealthy.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 10, 1896.
DESERT PUGET
SOUND'S FLEET.
Sealing Vessels Prefer to
Sail Under the Flag
of England.
ARE BETTER PROTECTED
British Captains Not Supposed
to Observe Bering Sea
Regulations.
CAN KILL WITH IMPUNITY.
Canadian Shipping Profits by the
Activity of American Revenue
Cutters.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., May 9.â
Owners and backers of sealing schooners
on Fuget Sound are much discouraged
over the outlook for profitable work this
year, it being assumed by agents that only
one sealing schooner, the Eppinger, has
this year returned with enough skins to
meet expenses.
But the Eppinger has been here for more
than a week vainly endeavoring to find a
purchaser for its catch, and will leave to
morrow morning for San Francisco with
the skins in the hope of meeting with
i better success there. Captain White of
i the Eppinger is very much disgusted with
the sealing outlook, from the standpoint
of the American sealer especially, and says
he will float the British flag when next he
goes out.
"There does not appear to be much in
the fnture for the sealskin trade," said
Captain White, "at least not under the
American flag. There is a lot of rigama
role to go through by the captains of seal
ers that is simply foolishness.
"Kegulations require that a log shall be
! kept showing the day's domes, the nnm
| ber of seals taken, where found, in what
quantities, whether rolling, fhinine or
what, and all this takes a lot of time that
ought to be spent at business, instead of
I foolishness like this. This is what I think
about it, and it is what every American
', sealer thinks.
There's one thing that a sealer can do,
and that is to go under the British flag,
' and that's what a good many of them will
\ do, as some have already done this sea
1 son. The British sealers have a
great advantage over the American
when out at work, and under
i the refusal of the British Government
1 to agree to the regulations that have been
- provided by the United States Revenue
Department, British sealeis are not sub
| ject to anything like the restrictions that
! surround American vessels."
It is indisputable that the United States
j regulations have always operated to drive
j our sealers from under the protection of
< the American flag.
Five years ago Puget Sound was the
; rendezvous for a big fleet of sealing schoon-
e rs, and they were outfitted on this side at
the opening of the season and returned
! here for the close season, the business at
that time being in line for developing into
: one of the chief shipping industries of
1 Puget Sound.
But sealers were not long in learning
that the American flag afforded them lit
tle or no protection in pursuit of what
, they considered legitimate operations.
: They were pursued by revepue cutters and
j seized for doing what British schooners
I alongside of them were doing with impu
! nity.
The greater part of the American
schooners were not lone under the Ameri
can flag after they realized the situation,
and the greater part of the "British" seal
j ing fleet this year celebrated the Fourth of
j July in a manner that would do credit to
the most patriotic American merchant
man afloat.
SEATTLE'S DIVORCE CASE,
Twenty Californians Depose in
Defense of Accused Mrs.
Dawson.
Deny That She Was Intoxicated at
the Fiesta in Los
Angeles.
SEATTLE, Wash., May 9.â Ex-Mayor
J. T. Ronald has returned from Cali
fornia, whither he went in the interests
of his client, Mrs. R. L. Dawson, against
whom suit for divorce is pending. As a
result of the visit Mrs. Dawson will go into
court with the depositions of twenty or
more witnesses who will swear that Mrs.
Dawson's deportment was ladylike while
in California. Attorney Ronald inter
viewed nearly one hundred people who
knew Mrs. Dawson and he says they all
spoke well of her conduct during her resi
dence in California.
It will be shown that George Kinseyand
his wife, formerly Lottie Evans, hare
made statements in their depositions
which were untrue and which they knew
to be untrue. For instance: Kinsey swore
that on the last day and night of ths fiesta
at Los Angeles, Mrs. Da'.vson, Mrs. Rey
nolds and Mr. Eckstrom were carousing
about the streets, and that Mrs. Dawson
was intoxicated ; that in the morning she
went around en masque, and once when
she mot Kinsey tried to kiss him. It was
with difficulty! Kir.scy swore, that he ex
tricated himself. Ronald says he will be
able to show that Eckstrom has been a
friend of Mrs. Dawson and family for
years; that he is a temperance advocate
and a prominent merchant, and that he
was with the two women, but they were
sober and conducted themselves as ladies
at all times.
The Kinseys disappeared before they
gave the depositions in favor of Dr. Davr
son. The latter afterward alleged that
they had been gotten out of the way by
Mrs. Dawson, but the woman's counsel
proved that the charge was untrue. Ronald
was unable to locate them and is satisfied
they are not in Los Angeles.
The deposition of W. N. Barber Jr. of
Los Angeles has been received by the
County Clerk, and Ju<lee Humes ordered
it published, at the request of counsel for
Dr. Dawson. Barber gave testimony fa
vorable to Dr. Dawson. He is but 23
years of age, and his home is at Chats
worth Park, in Los Angeles County. He
at once goes into the matter of George
Kinsey's meeting two women, one of
whom is alleged to be Mrs. Dawson, at the
fieata in 1896. Barber dgÂ«s cot say who
the women were, but says he was with
Kinsey when the latter met them. He
says :
"We walked along Spring street, and
near Court street we met this woman, and
3he was with another woman. One of
them put her arms about his neck and
said, 'Hello, George, when did you get
back ?' I did not hear bis reply. I walked
on a few steps, and did not hear any of
the conversation, except when she said,
'Hello, George,' and he talked to her for
about fifteen or twenty minutes, and then
he came up to me and then turned down
Court street in the vicinity of the Vienna
Buffet.
"The women were both dressed, so far as
I could see, in black dresse-. It might
have been blue, but it looked black at
night, and they had on what are com
monly called dominos. The women acted
as if they were intoxicated. I don't know
for sure, but they acted so. I judged they
were from the way they walked and were
carrying on, and when they turned down
Court street they looked to me as if they
were going down to the Vienna Buffet. We
lost track of them right by the Vienna.
They were going from one side of the
street to the other, and laughing and fall
ing against men that they happened to
pass. All that Kinsey told me was that
they were a couple of women that he knew
up in the northern part of the State. He
did not say in which city nor anything of
tbe kind."
In the cross-examination Barber said
thousands of people were on the streets
joking and jostling each other, many be
ing in mask. He had seen but few
women intoxicated and did not drink him
self. The two women he saw were not of
a degraded type.
Just how soon the Dawson case will
come on for trial is a question. Counsel
for Mrs. Dawson is now preparing inter
rogatories which will be submitted to
court soon and then forwarded to Califor
nia, where they will be answered and re
turned. The plaintiff will have some
cross-interrogatories to be answered, and
after that both sides will be ready to come
into court and have the case aired finally.
SAN BENITO GRAND JURY
Ex-County Treasurer Montgom
ery Indicted on Charges of
Embezzlement.
Outcome of a Fierce Political Fight
That Has Been Waged for
Years.
HOLLISTER, Cal., May 9.â The Grand
Jury to-day returned an indictment of six
counts against E. B. Montgomery, for
merly Treasurer of San Bsnito County.
The indictment charges the embezzlement
of public money.
Three months ago Montgomery resigned
from office and made good several thou
sand dollars' shortage, and it was gener
ally supposed this was the end of the
trouble. Judge Breen. however, called a
special Grand Jury session to investigate.
The jury was composed of farmers, who
probed deeply into the conduct of every
county olticer, and openly announced their
intention to "make a clean sweep."
Montgomery is well known throughout
the State, and is one of the most popular
men in the county. His losses are attrib
uted more to carelessness and inability to
resist the importunities of friends than to
dishonesty. The indictment is the out
come of a fierce political fight that has
been waged in this county for some years.
Montgomery's bail of $^â 00 was furnished
within a few minutes alter the return of
the indictment was made public. The
jury has several cards up its sleeve yet,
and it is reported that more indictments
for misconduct In office will follow.
THE SEATTLE LEPER.
Authorities in a Quandary as to Whither
They Should Send the Un
fortunate.
SEATTLE, Wash., May 9.â The authori
ties, State, county and city, are very much
puzzled as to what disposition shall be
made of the leper discovered in this city. It
is possible that an application will be made
to have the victim placed in a certainl aza
retto in British Columbia, maintained at
the expense of the Dominion Government ;
but should the request be granted in this
instance the State of Washington would
have to psy for the leper's keeping for
life.
The man gives his name as Abel John
son. He is a Russian, 42 years old and
was naturalized in Montana. He claims
to have resided on the Puget Sound four
veara. Health Officer Palmer believes
Johnson had the disease in his system
before leaving Russia, though the" leper
says he has been ailing only about two
months.
SACRAMENTO DECISION.
All Indictment* Against Election Officer*
Are Quashed.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. May 9.â Judge
Ilinkson rendered a decision this morning
quashing all the indictments found by the
Grand Jury against the election officers in
connection with the First Ward election
scandal disclosures in this city.
The decision is baaed on the failure f o
apprise defendants of their rights at the
time they gave testimony before the Grand
Jury. It is thought that a similar pro
ceeding will be had in the matter of
charges brought against the members of
the Board of Supervisors.
Chairman Morrison of the County Board
of Supervisors when called to the stand
said that he had been summoned before
the Grand Jury to testify as to certain
matters pertaining to the Board of Super
visors.
He had not been told that lie did not
have to testify and made no objection to
answering the questions, because he sup
posed he had to answer them. He went
before the Grand Jury a second time
voluntarily.
He had heard that Dr. C. B. Nichols had
been before the Grand Jury and accused
the Supervisors of selling him his position
as City Physician for $300 and he
wanted to set this matter right and
had gone before the Grand Jury and asked
them to indict him so that he could go
into court and clean his skirts of the
charge. The Grand Jury, however, would
not give him any satisfaction, and Fore
man Weil laughed at him.
SACRAMENTO BEE SUED.
C. B. Gillmmn Wants 5.f0.000 Damages

SACRA MKNTO, Cal., May 9.â C. H.
Oilman, who recently secured a decision of
the Supreme Court confirming the decision
of the Superior Court giving him $500
damages against the Evening Bee for libel,

for $50,000 damages.
The paper Intely reprinted the original
article on which the verdict was secured,
using it as a text upon which to dilate and
show that the decision of the court was
unjust, although it might be the law as it
stands.
The Astoria Fishermen* War.
ASTORIA, Ob.. May 9.â Five hundred

QUEER HOLD-UP
OF A FRESNOITE.
Claims He Was Forced by-
Two Men to Sign
a Note.
ONE HAD A REVOLVER.
Thrust the Muzzle Against His
Head and Ordered Him
to Write.
DEATH WAS THE ALTERNATIVE
Yielded to Their Demands to Save His
Lifeâ The Alleged Robbers
Arrested.
FRESNO, Cal., May 9.â G. L. Ferrel to
day swore to a complaint in Justice St.
John's court, charging George Rupert and
Samuel Packwood with robbery. Rupert
was immediately arrested and procured
bail, with his wife and Mrs. Sarah Brown
as sureties. Packwood was arrested at
Santa Cruz on a telegraphic warrant dur
ing the afternoon.
Ferrel alleges that Rupert and Packwood
forced him to aun a note in favor of Ru
pert to the amount of $80.
According to his statement they got him
into Rupert's saloon on a pretense of get
ting a drink. There was no one else in the
room at the time. Packwood drew a pistol
and leveled it at the complainant's head .
Rupert closed the doors of the place, and
while Packwood was holding the pistol to
Ferrel's head the note was produced. He
was threatened with death if he would not
sign it. He did as directed, as he was in
great fear of his life at the time.
Rupert tells a different story. Ferrel
had been tending bar in his saloon and
borrowed $80 from him. Rupert became
distrustful of Ferrel and insisted on a note
for $80. The Baloon-keeper claims that he
did not make any pretense of force. After
signing the note Ferrel went about town
telling that Rupert and Packwood had
forced him to sign it.
Rupert says that when he heard this he
became very angry and went before United
States Court Commissioner Prince and
swore to a complaint charging Ferrel with
opening a letter which had been left at the
saloon while Ferrel was in his employ.
The examination of Ferrel before Prince
resulted in a dismissal.
The case is attracting considerable atten
tion. George Rupert has been in the
saloon business here almost since the
founding of the city. Packwood is well
known throughout the county.

Human Life.
Once Attempted to Choke the Mother
Superior of a Vancouver
Convent.
PORTLAND, Or., May 9.-Dr. W. H.
Wall of Vancouver, Wasn., was in Port
land to-day, in company with Detectives
Welsh and Cody. He visited the Tounty
Jail, to identify John R. Cosgrove, the
thug who attempted to strangle Marie
Leville, a French woman in the White
chapel. In Cosgrove the doctor renocnized
a man whom some weeks ago he treated in
the Sisters' hospital in Vancouver. There,
the doctor says, he evinced the same mur
derous tendency which led to the at
tempted murder bere on the night of
April 28.
One day Cosgrove essayed to choke to
death the mother superior, and on the fol
lowing day he made a similar attack upon
a sister. Then Dr. Wall concluded that
Cosgrove must be insane. He was exam
ined by a commission in lunacy and regu
larly committed to the Steilacooaa Asylum
for the Insane.
The doctor was ignorant of the man's
discharge from the infirmary until he read
an account of his arrest here. Dr. Wall at
once wired to the asylum regarding Cos
grove's discharge, and the reply stated
that the patient, during his confinement
there, failed to Kive the remotest evidence
of a disturbance of his mental equilibrium.
"I know him to be a very dangerous
man," added Dr. Wall; "in fact, entirely
too unsafe to be without restraint. He
told me that he had received a letter from
New York commanding him to strangle
some one. That written mandate, Cos
crove said, had hypnotized him, and he
felt bound to obey it oefore he could break
the spell. This man has a peculiar and
most vicious murderous monomania,
wh-ich can only be curbed by his confine
ment where he cannot reacn another
human being weaker than himself."
MAN-HUNTING IN MADERA
Outlaws Laverone and Roberts
Evade the Posse in
Pursuit
B'.ocdhonnds Get Off the Trail After
Reaching the Broken Bock
board.
MADERA, Cal., May 9.â Outlaws
Laverone and Roberts, the Madera jail
escapes, continue to baffle the searching
posses. The only pc-son who has returned
from the hunt is District Attorney Wal
lace. When he left the officers they had
not yet succeeded in putting the blood
hounds upon the track of the outlaws,
and no trace of them had been discovered
since their broken buckboard was found.
Mr. Wallace says the officers are of the
opinion that Roberts and Laverone are in
the vicinity of Quartz Mountain, which,
like the rest of the country in the foot
hills, affords excellent hiding places for
the bandits, as there are many caves sur
rounded by underbrush, which the officers
could not approach without running great
risk in exposing themselves as targets for
the outlaws.
Every rancher in the bills has joined in
the hunt, and the posse now numbers over
100 xueo, all heavily armed.

NEVADA CONVENE,
Send Unpledged Delegates
to the Convention at
St. Louis.
DECLARE FOR SILVER.
Sixteen-to-One Clause Inserted in
the Platform After an
Argument.
PROTECTION IS DEMANDED.
Resolutions Favor the Displacement of
the State Senators and Repre
sentatives.
VIRGINIA CITY, Nev., May 9.-Nevada
Republicans held their State convention,
to elect six delegates and six alternates to
the Republican National Convention, at
National Guard Hall this afternoon. They
sent an unpledged delegation to St. Louis,
and atter a heated sortie included a '*16 to
1" clause in the financial plank ot tne reso
lutions.
The convention was called to order by
Hon. Trenmor Coftin, chairman of the
Republican State Central Committee. Ex-
Governor R. K. Colcord was chosen tem
porary chairman and E. D. Vanderiieth
temporary secretary. They were after
ward made permanent officers. Mr. Col
cord, on assuming the chair, appointed
the usual committees.
After a short adjournment, the majority
report of the platform committee was read
and a motion to adopt it made. The
minority report was offered as a substitute
by Delegate Col burn of Virginia.
The platform contained in the majority
report congratulated the people of the
State and country on the prospect of a Re
public Presidential victory; favored the
restoration of currency as it stood prior
to 1873; recommended the displacement of
Nevada's Senators and Representatives as
non-residents; favored tariff protection
and protection for American labor; op
posed interference with non-sectarian
schools and the giving of aid to
sectarian schools: favored National leg
islation to control pauper immigration
and immigration of people holding views
opposed to the American form of govern
ment: favored a change in the naturaliza
tion laws, requiring as a qualification of
citizenship seven years' residence on the
part of foreigners and ability to read the
constitution of the United States;
favored an unpledged delegation to
the National Republican Convention.
The minority report differed from the
majority in that it contained the clause,
"Silver at the ratio of 16 to 1," which the
currency plank in the majority report did
not. The minority report was confined to
the currency plank.
The matter was finally settled by an
anendment to the currency plank, to the
effect that the convention "favored free
and unlimited coinage of silver at the ratio
of IB to 1." The report was then adopted.
The following delegates were elected:
J. B. Overton, Storey County; A. C. Cleve
land, White Pine County; G. F. Turretin,
Elko County; Enoch Strother. Storey; C.
H. Sproule, Elko, and W. D. Phillips,
Washoe.

lated and had beautifully worded resolu
tions thrust upon them. President Francis
blushed like a sixteen-year-old maiden at
the eulogy bestowed upon him, but it was
all deserved. The following resolutions
were passed:
Whereas, Experience has shown that 1a
Fiesta de Los Angeles is a most valuable means
of attracting widespread attention to Los An
geles and Southern California, and thereby
has become a public enterprise of vital im
portance to this section:
Rrtolved, Thin it is the sense of the committee
of thirty that the annual celebration of La
Fiesta de Log AngHps be perpetuated, and that
its management should be continued by the
Chaint>er of Commerce, Merchants' Association
and Board o{ Trade upon the same lines and
principles as thut just closed, subject to such
minor changes as may be decided upon.
The fiesta executive committee of this
city has lonir been debating what beautiful
gift it could make the Queen of the late
fiesta as token of tLeir appreciation and
admiration. A loving cup has been de
cided upon, and a beautiful one has been
ordered and will be suitably inscribed and
given to Queen Mildred at an early date.

MADERA GUN
CLUB MEMBERS,
Confidence in Their Winning
Honors at the Fresno
Shoot To-Day.
BIRDS AND BLUEROCKS.
All the Central Counties of the
Valley to Contest in the
Big Tournament.
IN SIX INTERESTING EVENTS.
First Annual Tournament of the
Fresno Sportsmen's Clubâ The
Crack Shots.
MADERA, Cal., May 9. -A great deal
of interest is taken here in the big bird
and bluerock shooting event at Fresno
to-morrow morning. Several counties will
be represented by teams, in fact all the
central valley counties are expected to
send their best gun shots. It is known
that at least the Sanger, Visalia, Hanford,
Fresno and Madera clubs will be well rop
resented at the tournament of the Fresno
Sportsman's Clnb. This is the first annual
event given by the Fresno ciub, but from
the evidences of success already shown, it
is pretty certain not to be the last annual
event. The tournament will begin at 9
o'clock in the morning at the Fair Grounds
in Fresno, and there are six features on
the programme. The first three of these
are with live birds, and the last three with
bluerocks, and there are substantial
puses for the first, second and third win
ner of each shoot.
None but members of gun clubs are eligi
ble to shoot, and the rules of the American
Shooting Association are to govern. H.
V. Armitage, A. F. Naber, A. Riley are
the members of the tournament commit
tee for the Fresno Sportsman's Club. Only
eight members of the Madera Club will
take part in the big inter-county shoot,
but it is quite likely that a very large per
centage of all the members will attend the
tournament as guests of the Fresno Club.
Madera's Club is composed entirely of
the well-known business and professional
men of this city.
D. B. Horace, president of the club, is
one of the largest vineyard ists and ranch
ers in this part of the country.
J. B. Meloche, the secretary and treas
urer, is the Public Administrator of Madera
County, and a real estate and insurance
broker. The other members of the club
are:
A. H. Woolery, a well-known citizen,
and the best shot in the county.
Francis A. Fee, ex-District Attorney.
John J. Roberts, ion of the president of
the Commercial Bank of Madera.
William Krohn, the County Tax Col
lector.
Joseph Barcroft, hardware merchant.
E. H. Cox, cashier Commercial Bank of
Madera.
S. T. Alderson, dealer in cigars and
tobacco.
R. L. Gryder, proprietor of tonsorial par
lors.
G. F. Cramer, retail liquor merchant.
W. F.^Waddell, wheelwright and wagon
maker.
B. C. Fisher, master mechanic in the
Madera sash, door and blind factory.
W. C. Tighe, clothing merchant.
8. D. Tooker, retail liquor dealer.
E. E. Wilcox, Auditor of Madera County.
E. Puph, proprietor of tonsorial parlors.
J. W. Rajesdale, dealer in general mer
chandise.
The Madera Gun Club is one of the in
stitutions of this city, and of the entire
county for that matter, and it is confident^
ly expected that the eight crack shots se
lected to take part in the tournament at
Fresno to-morrow will not return without
at least its fair share of prizes.
HOLD-UP AT SAN JOSE.
A Footpad Frightened by the Overturning
of His Intended Victim's
Carriage.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 9.â An attempt
was made to hold up A. A. Smith, the
groceryman, at the corner of Willow street
and Myrtle avenue at a late hour last
night. Smith was driving home in a
buggy, and as he neared the corner a man
armed with two revolvers jumped out in
front of him and commanded him to halt.
The horse became frightened, and, wheel
ing suddenly, crpsized the buggy. This
was more than the robber expected, and
he fled in the darkness.
Smith was cauirht in the rig and dragged
about fifty feet. The horse was stopped
and put into its stable, but this morning
it was found that the animal's legs were
broken, and the horse will probably have
to be shot.

LUBIN SEEKS A DIVORCE
Papers Filed in Which His
Wife Is Charged With
Adultery.
Ex-Mayor Steinman Named as Co
respondent â The Complainant a
Well-Known Merchant.
David Lubin of the firm of Weinstock <fc
Lubin of Sacramento has filed papers for
divorce from his wife, on the ground of
adultery, naming ex-Mayor Ben U. Stein
man of Sacramento as co-respondent.
Mrs. Lubin has left the City for the East.
It is stated that Mrs. Lubin s objection
able conduct has been going on for three
years past, though it was only recently
that her husband secured sufficient defi
nite evidence to warrant the institution of
the suit.
There are five children, and it is said to
be Mr. Lubin's purpose to take them East
this evening, so as to eet them out of the
wav before the matter becomes public
through publication in the newspapers.
It is further reported that recently Mr.
Lubin placed detectives on the track of
his wife, and that the evidence thus pro
cured brought about the immediate filing
of the papers in the suit.
These have heen in the County Clerk's
custody some time, but no one has been
permitted to have access to them.
About eight months ago Mr?. Lyons,
the mother of Mrs. Lubin, died and left to
each of her children quite a sum of money.
The firm of Weirrstock, Lubin <fc Co. has
been in existence in Sacramento for about
a quarter of a century.
Mr. Lubin is the author of the proposi
tion to have the Government pay a
bounty on wheat exported to foreign coun
tries.
MISS BELINFANTE WEDS,
Sequel to the Sensational Love
Story of the Blind Italian
Singer.
They Met Two Months Ago in Hong
kong and He Fell in Love at
First Sight.
The sequel to a romantic story of love at
first sight took place yesterday when
Estelle Belinfante, the blind contralto,
was married to R. Edminster, the Wfll
known agent, who has arranged for her
concerts since her arrival here from the
Orient.
Of course the expression, "Love at first
sight," must be used advisedly in the
young lady's case, because she is slowly
losing even the sense of distinguishing
day from night, and could not tell, except
from the remarks of other people, what a
dashing, good-looking young fellow Ed
minster was.
It was the agent who fell in iove at first
sight and made love so persistently that
his ardor was rewarded yesterday by the
marriage above mentioned.
The couple met about two months ago
in Hongkong. Edminster, who has been
for live years with the well-known im
pressario, Major Pond, had gone to the
Orient as agent for Ovide Musin, and was
atxmt to embark for home again when he
met the handsome young contralto, who
had just come from a successful concert
tour in Japan and Siberia.
Miss Belinfante's lady companion, wno
had accompanied her from Europe, had
contracted malaria in Hongkong and had
been forced to return to Italy. The singer
was alone and very helpless, in spite of
ncr independent spirit, when she and
Edminister met on the eve of embarkation
for San Francisco.
The agent fell in love on the spur of the
moment, and he was filled with satisfac
tion to learn that Miss Belinfante was to
sail in the steamer in which he had ar
ranged to travel. There were a thousand
ways in which he could render himself
useful and acceptable to her on the voy
age, and he did not neglect one of them.
He carried her deck chair, helped her
up and down tlie stairways, wrote her let
ters, read her correspondence and in fact
made himsalf almost indispensable to the
blind singer.
Since arriving in San Francisco the ar
dent swain has not slackened any of his
attentions, and though Miss Belinfante
was at first inclined to look upon him
with a merely platonic regard the mar
riage yesterday proves that he has it last
succeeded in persuading her to change her
opinion.
The fact is that the young lady has been
exceptionally sought after, and Edrninater
knew that his only chance lay in captur
ing his lady-iove wuile she was under the
spell of all the good offices and little
attentions he has so patiently performed
for tier.
Tne bride and groom leave to-day for
Chicago, where Mrs. Edminster will re
sume ncr profession of concert-giving.
Blazing Brandy.
A still alarm was turned in to Chemical En
gine No. 3 for a fire in Joseph Bender & Co.'s
wholesale liquor house, at 310 Sacramento
street, at 12:30 this morning.
When the firemen arrived arrived they found
that a couple of barreiS of cognac had caught
fire. The barrels were rolled into the street.
It was impossible to extinguish the flames,
and tne lire had to be allowed to burii itseh
out.
There was no damage to the building, but
the liquor destroyed was valued at about
$500.
SANTA BARBARA
DEAD ACCUSED,
Sensational Verdict in the
Joseph A. Kenny
Will Case.
VICTORY OF THE WIDOW
A Jury Declares That She Was
Defrauded by Her Late
Husband.
SIGNED AWAY THE PROPERTY.
Robbed by a Clause Inserted in a
Conditional Deed Before His
Death.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., May 9.â For
many months past an interesting caee, in
volving laree interests and important
legal issues, has been before the Superior
Court of this county, furnishing the text
for five separate suits. In 1892 Joseph A.
Kenney, a wealthy resident of this city,
died, leaving property valued at $65,000.
W. S. Parks and J. C. Kenney were ap
pointed executors of the estate, and when
the widow came to receive her portion she
was shown a deed executed by her husband
before his death and bequeathing his entire
estate to some thirty nephews and nieces,
leaving her only a life interest. To her
surprise she was confronted by her own
signature affixed to this document.
Mrs. Kenney remembered signing a deed
conveying to her husband all of her prop
erty in case her demise occurred during his
lifetime. This document, which was read
to her at the time she affixed her signature,
was a part of a mutual agreement, her
husband at the time making a similar con
veyance to her conditional upon her sur
vival of his death.
She absolutely denied having ever heard
or seen the clause limiting her interest in
the estate to a life lease and claimed that
this portion of the document she signed
was not read to her, nor would she
have signed it had she known it was em
bodied in the conveyance.
The two deeds were executed June 1,
1893. They were drawn by W. S. Bouton,
and by him read to Mrs. Kenney. The is
sues involved in the present case were
submitted to a jury and were decided as
follows:
Firstâ Was the clause limiting the estate
granted to Mrs. Sarah J. Kenney to a life es
tate inserted therein with the knowledge of Jo
seph A. Kenney?
Answerâ Yea.
Secondâ Was the said clause inserted in the
deed fraudulently as against Mrs. Keuney?
Answerâ Yes.
Thirdâ Did Joseph A. Kenney know or sus
pect that Mrs. Kenney believed 'the said deed
to be an absolute deed in fee simple?
Answerâ Yes.
These decisions end the first chapter in
what bids fair to become a celebrated case.
They carry a grewsome suggestion, inas
much as they directly charge the dead
man with a felonious act. All of the es
tate involved was really Mrs. Kenney 's
separate property, being purchased with
$65,000 belonging to her at the time of her
marriage. An Indiana farm which was
her husband's separate property was
deeded by him to his own heirs with her
full consent and knowledge.

Just in the
Nick of Time
Another Week and William Hinchet of
Pasadena, Cal., Would Have Been
in a Serious Difficulty.
THE DOCTORS ALL DISAGREED.
A Singular Recovery From a Horrible
Stomach Trouble Which. Surpasses <
Many Fiction Storiesâ lt Is Vouched
for by Reputable People.
Every one knows that Pasadena is one
of the Dleasantlv situated resorts of Cali-
fornia. To the Eastern man it is a dream.
Midwinter sees fruits and flowers, luscious
and sweet-scented, in the open air. It is
his elysium. Nevertheless, in this veri-
table garden-spot one can have serious
trouble. William Hinchet comes from
the city of Chicago â big wind, lake and
bustle. He knew no one in Pasadena.
He came in search of health, and for a
time he prospered as well as any one
conld wish for. About two weeks ago he
was seized with colic and cramps and had
to call in a physician immediately. A
prescription was given to nim, and it was
thought that he would pull through in the
night and be fresh and easy by morning.
M< rning came, but Hincbet suffered still.
This began to look serious.
It was necessary to relieve the bowels,
as it was discovered that Hinchet had
been suffering from Chronic Constipation.
Temporary relief was afforded him, but
he grew worse. The doctors disagreed. It
was on the advice of an old woman that
Hinchet began to use a medicine called
JOY'S VEGETABLE SARSAPARILLA.
He took repeated doses of this herb rem-
edy in the night, and the next morning
his bowels began to move freely. Since i
this time Mr. Hinchet has been using
JOY'S VEGETABLE SARSAPARILLA,
and now he is well and doing well. He
praised the HOME REMEDY,
JOY'S VEGETABLE SARSAMRILU.
Though the doctors remained puzzled.
WHY JOY'S VEGETABLE SARSA-
PARILLA IS SO EFFECTUAL IN CON-
STITUTIONAL TREATMENT. In it
you have the active principles of Vegeta-
ble drugs that act directly and mildly on
the organs of digestion, the li/er, kidneys
and bowels. It contains no mercury,
iodide of potash, to ruin the membranes
of the stomach and bowels and to cause
your bones to ache.
Beware of lodide or Potassium. No
good Sarsaparllla contains lodide of
Potassium,
NEW TO-DAT.
Has Been the Practice of Medicine
and Surgery in San Francisco
by Dr. Sweany.
THE STORY OF HIS SUCCESS.
The Great Specialist Has Made Life Anew to Thousands and Tens
of Thousands Who Had Been Given Up by Other Physi-
cians â His Specialties and Mode of Treatment.
DOCTOR SWEANY,
737 Market Street, San Francisco, Cal.
By his skill as a specialist Dr. Sweany has completely revolutionized
the practice of medicine and Sursrery In San Francisco.
Standing to-day as he does far In advance of any specialist or medical
Institution In the country, his wonderful success and skill Is the out-
growth of several conditions by which alone what he has done in San
Francisco could be accomplished.
First, the qualifications with which nature has endowed him, as evi-
denced by his keen perception Into the mysteries of all diseases with
which those who apply to him are afflicted. He is thus enabled to clearly
distinguish the exact character of the complaint and to conceive the
proper and most effective kind of treatment for Its entire cure.
Second, he Is wholly devoted to his profession, havingr no other desire
for achievement than to make still grander the complete success which
he has thus far attained. His great stability of character, his unceasing
study and untiring energy to accomplish that which he sets out to do,
together with many more great and noble qualities which one soon recog-
nizes In him, all serve to advance him In his most worthy ambition.
Third, his great advantages of study and experience In the leading and
best colleges and hospitals In the land, where he served In all depart-
ments and where his great natural ability was acknowledged In all
branches as being superior to his quite worthy, but] less successful asso-
ciates, have all helped to assist him in his work.
Is It any wonder that with all of these advantages In his favor, natural
ability, study, experience and a mind devoted to his profession. Dr.
Sweany should have achieved his enviable reputation for curing distress-
Ing and obstinate cases which had been given up as Incurable ?
The Doctor has made a life-long study and practice of all sexual ail-
ments of young, middle-aged and old men. He also gives special attention
to diseases of the eye, ear, head, heart, throat, stomach, liver and bowels,
kidneys, bladder and urinary organs. His success In the treatment of all
these diseases has been really phenomenal, and what Is more he guaran-
tees a perfect cure in every case heundertakes.
As yet no case of failure can be discovered against him, and such abil-
ity and skill to combat and conquer all diseases of men and women have
never before been demonstrated.
The Doctor's services are certainly of great value, and if any one thing
be worth more than any thins: else It is certainly the services of a compe-
tent and successful physician and specialist, who never loses sight of a
single case until a perfect and permanent cure Is effected. Those who
are afflicted should not waste time, money and health dosing with cheap
treatments, cheap medicines and nostrums.
Altogether, Dr. Sweany as a man is truly upright, conscientious" and
charitable. As a physician he Is thoroughly competent, earnest and suc-
cessful, and any and all persons who may be suffering from any human
ailments whatever will do themselves a great Injustlce'iflthey do not call
upon him, even If their troubles have resisted all other efforts to cure. His

DOWNED A HOT FAVORITE
Imp. Candid Headed G. B. Morris
Out for the Rich Spreckels
Handicap.
WOETH $5000 TO THE WINNER
Cabrillo Wins, Starting a Favorite.
Olive Was Too Speedy for a
Crowd of Sprinters.
The black Australian mare Candid fur
nished tfce racing surprise at Ingleside
yesterday. With but two starters in the
rich $7500 Spreckels handicap, over a dis
tance of four miles, having as an only
com etitor the bay colt G. B. Morris, a son
of the immortal Longfellow, she won in a
manner that stamped her as a rarer far
above the common. Of the original
twenty-seven entries to the stake G. B.
Morris, carrying Ed Corrijran's gieen col
ors, and the Australian matron sporting
the colors of A. B. Spreckels, president of
the Pacific Coast Jockey Club, were all
that remained to contest for the prize. The
race was a surprise from the fact that the
most ardent friends of the black mare
thought that Bhe might possibly make a
fair showing for Ã¼bout two miles at the
most and then occupy a reserved scut and
see Mr. Corrigan's horse finish the run
amid the plaudits of the va;-t multitude.
However, nothing of the l:ind happened
The bookmakers laid 1 to 6 against G. B.
Morris and ti to 1 against Candid.
From a spectator's point of view the
race was a very pretty one. Tbe duo
raced lapped, with Mdrris making the
running until about three furlongs from
the wire. Piggott, on Cundid, here made
his run, and heading Morrifl in the stretch
had no difficulty in beating him out by
half a length in 7:24^.
The Corrigan entry finished much dis
tressed, but Candid was as frisky us a kit
ten at the tin.su. The time is within
three-quarters of a second of that made by
imp. Star Ruby when he defeated Gilead
on Washington's birthday of the present
year; but considering the track, which is
much slower than the li^htnine-fast clayey
course at the Bay District, and the strong
wind that \vas blowing, the winner's per
formance is conceded to be the best ever
made on tbe Pacific Coast.
The long distance event attracted a great
crowd of racegoers and the bookmakers
did a land office business. But three of
the seven favorites captured purses, yet
the ring had a very rough day of it, nearly
all of the pencilers quitting behind on the
day's speculating.
Fourteen two-year-olds sported silk in
the opening four and a half furlong scram
ble. Hohenzollern, the Eimwood slock
farm's representative, ruled a 2 to 1 choice,
and ridden out he beat Kachaei, the Corri
gan entry, a length. Widow Jones was a
close third.
The mile and a sixteenth handicap
called out but live s'arters. Cabrillo, who
carried the majority of the coin, bet at
odds of 4 to 5, made nearly all of the
running, and at the end headed St. Lee
out by a neck in the fast time of I:4BJÂ£.
Nebuchadnezzar was a good third.
From an observer's view of it in the bet
ting ring Hello was a "moral" for the
hurdle race, a flood of coin forcing his
odds down from threes to a 7 to 5 favorite.
In the first run for home he was easily
beaten out by the 2 to 1 second choice,
Montdlvo, ridden by George Cochran. who
was given out as a "dead one." Aruudel
was third.
Following the big four-mile race was a
six-furlong sprinting dash, and Yankee
Doodle again disappointed his followers.
Starting au 8 m o favorite he showed

Fourteen Carpenters Strike.
The efforts of the Buiidinc Trades Council
to unionize all the shops and j <bs in town are
meeting with more encouragement every day.
Yesterday there was an Interesting strike on
the job on Fourth and Welsh streets caused by
the appearance of a gang of non-union
painters. Fourteen carpenters went out ana
refused to work ou an unfair job. This piece
of work has caused much trouble to the
unions. First there was tbe lathers' troubles,
which lasted until recently, and now the car
penters are out on uccount of the non-union
painters. ____________________
STOCKS QUIET YESTERDAY.
Reported Embarrassment of Two
More Brokers Because of
the Rise.
Wheelbarrows to Be Supplanted by
Flat Cars on the Brunswick
Lode in a We k Hence.
It was reported on the street yesterday
afternoon that two other brokers had been
smitten with the dollar rise in Conistocks
and had fallen by the wayside. But it
was expected that both brokers would be
able to make a compromise with their
creditors and settle matters amicably.
Hence the matter was kept very quiet.
There were no new developments in the
matter of the failure of Harris and Atkin
son, and no news was given out in relation
thereto. It is understood that their de
iicits are in a fair way to be settled quietly.
It was dull in stocks also, but a very
small volume of businebs being done. The
brokers were engaged in settling up, squar
ing accounts and finding out where they
stood since the dollar earthquake struck
the peanut-stand on Pine street.
When the reported strike in Chollar, on
the Brunswick lode, was made, the ore
j was being removed in wheelbarrows.
Since then the work of laying a railroad
track has been begun in order that solid
chunks of cold and silver may beinovd
on curs. The work of tracklaying will
! consume a week.
There is a disposition in certain high
quarters to boom the Chollar in particular
and the leading Comstocks in general.
The boom is to be inaugurated by pushing
the work on favorable looking drifts on
the Brunswick lode, so it is said. The gen
[ eral impression is that a rise in stocks is
I necessary for the purpose of attracting
I cai'ital to the mines and stimulating busi
! ness in California and on the Comstock.
The fact tliat a large quantity of capital is
available in t:iis City and State seeking in
vestment is pointed out as an indication
of returning prosperity when coupled with
a rise in mining value.
The bulls dec'are that the recent rise is
caused by a s-trike of ore on the Bruns
wick loJe. and that on Monday there
will be a big advance. The bears say
that the strike, if any there was, did not
amount to anything, and that on Monday
something will drop. Yesterday Chol
lar sold at $1 95 and $2, Con. Ca"l. & Va.
$2 75 and $2 95, and Occidental at $1 55 and
j $1 70.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 10, 1896.
BURLINGAME VICTORIOUS
The Club Team Defeats River
side at Polo Before
Society Folk.
SCORE WAS TWELVE TO TWO.
Visitors Not in Fit Condition for the
Gameâ Brilliant Play Greatly
Eojoyed.
Society tnrned ont in Btimmer dresses
and horsy suits yesterday at Burlingame
to see the polo game between the club and
the Riverside team.
Society was on the field in fours-in-hand,
drags and open carriages, in dogcarts and
afoot, and enjoyed the exciting and whole
some diversion hugely.
Dropping into the fragrant fields of a
balmy afternoon was the first pleasurable
experience of a few hundred ladies and
gentlemen, after a run of half an hour
from the windy City. They went to
Burlingame in a special train, and imme
diately upon their arrival frisky polo
ponies began to appear on the grounds.
At the same time, too, the country con
tingent came upon the scene, accompanied
with rattling and rumbling of heavy drags
and heralded by the horn.
VV.S. Hobart's handsome four-in-hand
entered first at a speedy gait, driven by
Mrs. C. A. Spreckels; then eaine the prize
winning coach of C. A. Baldwin, who
held the reins, and presently the ciub
four-in-hand dashed up tv the roped,
driven by Mrs. J. b. Tobin. Lesa pretentious
equipages pulled up in the anclosure,
while the City visitors were making them
selves comfortable on the chairs and grand
stand, and then a horn called the players
into line.
Everything was in readiness for the
game. The stand was decorated with red
and blue bunting, the ground was in ex
cellent condition with enough grass to
keep down dust and sutiicient open soil to
make It easy aud sure for the ponies.
The game was calieu hi 2:46 o'clock, and
from that minute until tiie finish it was
majiniticent sport. While the teams were
not evenly matched and the play was con
sequently lacking in that quality of sus
pense and sustained interest which gives
zest to the con diet, it was accentuated at
frequent intervals with daxing runs and
spurts. So it was a spirited struggle with
Burlingaruf, the winning team, at its best,
and the Riverside men a close second. It
was evident ihtit the losing team's weak
ness was in bad form, ag.-iinst which oads
their skillful and dashing piay wan at
fault. They were all a trifle heavy and
not trained down like their competitors.
The ponies were an iniportaut factor in
the scores, for the Burlingame men had a
change at every inning, and possibly many
superior ponies also. 'Ihe result was a
score of 1^ for Buriingame against 2 for
Riverside.
Walter S. Hobart, R. M. Tobin, J. 8.
Toliin and Walter McCreery made up the
Burlingaine team. Gk L. Waring, R. L.
Bettuer, H. Maud and 0. K. Maud the
Riverside team. John Lawson was time
keeper and Captain A. Fane-Wamewright
v moire.
In the first inning the ball went into
Riverside territory, and after two minutes
through the coal, on Hobart's furious pla\ .
Riverside tooK the ball away next, but
Burlingame interfered when Hobart put it
clear over the players. Joe Tobin caught
it, after a hot fight between the teams,
lie was on Cigarette, and won a goal lor
Buriingame. This made two goals in ten
minutes.
Rivorside went in determined to win
and showed they could give a spirited
fight, in which the ball went back and
forth across the field until caught in a
funny scrimmage near tbe Burlingame
goal. Hobart got it again and made a
goal, the third in twenty-five minute*.
In the next innings the gains went in
favor of Riverside, until Joe Tobin caught
the ball and with an exciting dash took it
clear across the field ahead of all to the
Burlingame goal.
The visitors were uneasy, and no sooner
was the ball tossed off than it fell to Bett
ner, who led his opponents a merry race
and got a goal in one minute. He was
cheered for this exhibition of riding and
pretty playing.
Walter Hobart dashed off with the next
ball, which Joe Tobin picked up after his
miss. Tobin was well mounted and
made a fine run tbat ended in a coal.
There was some hot play in the next in
ning, but McCreery caught tbe ball, Uo
bart forged ahead and picked it off to goal.
When tLe players entered again, after a
rest, Hobart made a pretty run, which was
backed by Joe Tobm's clever play that
gave a goal in two minutes for Burlin
ganie. Tjen Riverside played well, but
met witn hot interference, and Hobart left
them all in the rear while he drove to
goal.
McCreery at this time began to feel like
a little exercise, so he took a pretty run
and made a goal in two minutes from the
start.
He repeated the dose in the next inning,
with a goal to his credit in three minutes.
Again his star was in t c ascendant. Ho
bart dashed across the field with the ball,
to be stopped by Waring, who rode like a
demon. At this point McCreery made a
goal.
Joe Tobin came in off side when the ball
was going with Burlingame. Riverside
claimed a knock-off, which was barely
given when Hobart ran away with the ball
almost to goal, where McCreery hit it
through the posts.
Waring made a dashing play in the next
inning. After getting the ball away it
was taken by C. E. Mand, who made a
splendid run on a little gray pony, amid
wild applause. He made a second equally
exciting run and got the second goal for
Riverside.
Three cheers were given for Riverside
and returned by the vanquished team.

SOCIALISTIC MOVEMENTS.
Rev. Dr. Dille Invited to Lecture Be
fore Liberty Branch.
The members of the Socialistic Labor
party do not always look within their own
ranks for speakers upon subjects of politi
cal economy and sociology. The members
of Liberty Branch believe that new ideas
c n be obtained from all classes of liberal
thinkers and speakers and to this end
have extended an invitation to the Rev.
E. R. Dille to deliver an address at one of
their Wednesday evening propaganda
meetings. Dr. Dille is at present in Hono
lulu, but a letter has been sent asking him
to matte such an appointment.
Arthur F. Sanborn has also been called
v pon for a lecture on social and economic
questions, and he has promised to speak
on the evening of the 13th inst.
At the last meeting of Liberty Branch
Georee Barnaby delivered a long address
on "Modern Cannibalism and Future Civ
ilization." Henry Warnecke gave an out
line of the aims of the Socialist Labor
Party. Alvln H. Appell read an essay on
international peace.
Secretary Theodore Lynch of the Cen
tral Trade and Labor Alliance has been
directed to invite the various branches of
the Socialist Labor Party, through the
Central Committee, to send delegates to
the Alliance, as the late labor convention
recently called by the Labor Council
adopted almost in its entirety the plat
form of principles of the Socialist Labor
party.
The French branch, S. L. P., will hold a
picnic at Harbor View on the 17th. The
affair is in the hands of an active com
m ttee of the various branches.

PULLED DOWN THE FENCE
Mayor Davie Removes the Bar
riers to the Eighth-Street
Bridge.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,?
908 Broadway, May 9. J .
Mayor Davie pulled ' down the fence
across the Eighth-street bridge to-night
and Superintendent of Streets Miller at
once rebuilt it. The Street Superintendent
has been advised by the City Attorney
that he did only his duty when he closed
the bridge and he advises him to keep it
closed. â  T 'lev
City Attorney Piersol said to Mr. Miller
to-day: "In answer to your question as to
whether or not the Mayor has any power
as such to direct the removal of said
barriers, I would advise that the Mayor
as such has no right or power to interfere
with you in your performance of this duty.
The City Council is the governing body of
the city, and the Mayor, as such, has no
powers except those specifically con
ferred upon him by the charter and ordi
nances tnereunder.
While engaged in causing tl c removal
of said barriers his caDacity could be no
higher than that of a private citizen, and
you can, if necessary, invoke the protec
tion of the conrts in the performance of
your official duty. But with a view to up
holding the good namo of the city, and
considering the frailties of human nature,
any procedure of that nature should only
be adopted as a last resort, and after all
reasonable efforts have failed in carrying
out the orders of the Council."
If the Mayor should again pull down
the fence the Street Superintendent will
probably arrest him.
The Mayor says his power in the prem
ises is absolute, and declares that he will
keep the bridge open now that it is safe.
POPULISTS WILL
TALK OF FINANCE,
The Prospects of Their
State Convention on
Tuesday.
TO TRIM THE PLATFORM
There Will Be Women Delegates,
but No Proxies and No
Fights.
SILVER FOR THE CHIEF PLAN]
The Local Delegation Decides to Go to
Sacramento Early and to Stick
Together.
The Populist State Convention wiil
come to order in the Assembly ichamber of
the Capitol in the forenoon of day after
to-morrow, the 12th inst., and ruiffor
about two days.
The active preparations for the conven
tion which are going on are quiet and
businesslike. There is no hurrah in the
air, the party feels the strains of no strug
gles about delegations, honors or policies,
no sensational combinations are talked
aboxit and there is nothing for anybody to
get excited over unless it be the alleged
sweeping victory for the party in Califor
nia, concerning which the leaders talk
calmly with confidence and self-possession.
E. M. Wardell, the veteran chairman of
the State Central Committee, went to Sac
ramento from this City yesterday after
noon to look after convention arrange
ments. Carleton H. Johnson, chairman
of the local executive committee, and some
others, probably including T. V. Cator and
State Secretary R. E. Bush, will be on the
ground to-day. To-ni^ht there will be
quite a gathering of Populist delegates up
there, and by to-morrow night a majority
of the delegates will arrive. Of course
quite a number of Populists will attend as
spectators.
The roll will contain the names of 300
delegates. At the convention of I SU4, the
number was 310. There were fewer dele
gates elected this year by about seventy
fire, but this year the members of the new
State Central Committee will sit as mem
bers of the convention.
The State Central Committee of sixty-six
members was selected by popular choice
along with the convention delegates. The
committee wiil elect a chairman and it
will unquestionably be E. M. Wardell of
Los Angeles, who has so fully the respect
and confidence of the party. The State
Central Committee will elect an executive
committee of seven members.
The convention will adopt a platform,
elect thirty-nine delegates to the St. Louis
convention, nominate Presidential elec
tors, nominate a United States Senator,
and do any other business which it doesn't
want to leave to the State Central Com
mittee, for there will be no second conven
tion.
If the rasping sound of great ideas grind
ing against each other is heard at all it
will be while the platform is around, Dut
it is not likely tnat there will be much
struggling to get things in or keep them
out. The People's party is largely
made up of what are, with increasing fre
quency, called "reform" elements, and at
tue convention of 1892 fhere was a torrent
of principles and things in the platform
that the country and society needed, but
the party has become more "homogeneous
and its principles well settled. The Omaha
platform is yet its creed.
But then there is in the party this year a
general plan to shorten platforms." The
party proposes to take up a few great ideas
and get the Silverites and Prohibitionists
and other elements to stand in with them.
So the State Convention platform will
likely be short.
The free coinage of silver plank will be
given the place of honor. The Populiit
campaign will be mainly on finance. The
abolition of National banks will be
tacked in.
Direct legislation through the initia
tive and referendum will be the next im
portant plank.
The Populists are everywhere for equal
suffrage and always have been, and tlie
convention is so sure to indorse the suf
frage amendment that Miss Anthony and
other campaign leaders are not likely to
waste time and money opening headquar
ters at Sacramento this week.
And the convention is so sure to declare
for the Government ownership of railroads
and agiinst the funding bill that Steve
Gage will not give his whisker- an extra
stroke on account of the convention.
Where the list of other things in the
Omaha platform and the minds of dele
gates will be chopped off is hard to tell.
This is what T. V. Cator said yesterday
about the probable platform:
In my opinion the principles of the Omaha
platform will be reaffirmed. The platform
will declare for free silver/direct legislation,
tfle restriction of immigration, woman suffrage
and the Government ownership of railroads,
all of which are in the Omaha platform.
There will be Borne things pertaining to State
issues. The convention will probably declare
for economy in the State government and a
fifty-cent limit on State taxation. It may
seem wise to deal with other State issues, such
as the reduction of certain State salaries,
which are now as high as ever, while the prices
of products have fallen.
The People's Darty favors public improve
ments on a sufficient scale, and will doubtless
declare for a system of good roads to be paid
for in part out of money that ought to be saved
in other directions.
There will probably be a strong plank on the
readjustment of our system ol State taxation.
Personally I favor making homesteads up to a
reasonable amount exempt fro in taxation and
incapable of being mortgaged, that the home,
the foundation of a free people, may be safe
from debt. Then I favor a graduated tax on
land and land vtUues, the ratio Increasing with
the proportion held by a single individual.
1 expect the Populist ticket lo carry the
State. It will no doubt poll 120,000 votes,
though last time it reached i.ut 63,000. Our
vote has doubled every time, and we can
double it this year ea.-u-r than before.
A lot of Populists from the southern part
of the State will want to insert a temper
ance plank, and this will be opposed on
the ground of expediency among others.
Preferential voting will be among the
things which will be pressed in the con
vention and probably left out of the plat
form.
It is not hkely that more than two Con
gressional Dibtrict conventions will be
held. The First and Seventh may nomi
nate Congressmen, but the others will
wait. In the First District George W.
Monteith will likely receive the nomina
tion. His championship of the railroad
strikers has won for him the hearty sup
port of the labor element.
One novel feature of the convention will
be the absence of proxies. Proxies won't
go. This is the first time this rule has
been adopted in this State. Its purpose is
to head off anything like boss manipula
tions. There will be just as many votes
as there are delegates present. County
committees have, in view of this, provided
for appointments in place of delegates who
cannot attend, just before the convention.
There will be women delegates in that
convention, too. San Francisco will send
but oneâ Mrs. T. V. Cator.
T. V. Cator will unquestionably get the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 10, 1896.
nomination for United States Senate::
again. He has been indorsed in San
Francisco aud in several counties of thÂ»
State. By the political theory of the
People's party a convention nomination for
Senator is taken to morally bind all mem
bers of the Legislature elected by the
party in exactly the way and sense that
Presidential Electors are bound by the
party nomination for President,
The San Francisco delegation, number
ing twenty-seven, held a lengthy meeting
with the" County Executive Committee
last evening at Mozart Hall.
Chairman C. H. Johnson presided while
the executive committee was in session. It
was found that four delega f es wouid not
be able to go to Sacramento, and their
places were tilled with W. W. Sanderson,
H. J. Tobias, Hugo Hornlein and Mrs. T.
V. Cator.
The delegation then met, emetine E. S.
Barney chairman and W. B> Walker sec
retary. T. V. Cator said that the conven
tion would come to order promptly at 10
a. m. next Tuesday and that it was urgent
that the delegates* go up Monday evening.
After a while twenty-one agreed to go
then.
How to travel there and back by the
complicated scheme by which the South
ern Pacific works its concession
of one fare to convention dele
gates took loner discussion as did
the Sacramento hotel to which the dele
gation ought to go. They won't go to the
Golden Eagle. That was mentioned once
in a joke. Lovers of the State House and
the Western were there, but it was agreed
that the delegation ought to stay together
and that it should camp at "the State !
House. A collection was taken up to send
a leleeram engaging quarters and head
quarters.
Burnett G. Haskell urged the impor
tance of a delegation caucus to see how it
should stand together, name its repre
sentatives on committees and so on, and it
was resolved to caucus at 9 a. m. Tuesday
at the i^tate House.
The following comprise the San Fran
cisco delegation :
State Central Committeeâ John C. Gore, T. H.
Porter, J. 1). Thompson, George D. Gillespie, C.
11. Johnson.
Delegatesâ E. S. Barney, W. J. Gret;r, C. M.

Hugo Hornlein, \V. \V. Sanderson, Mrs. T. V.
Cator.
At T. V. Cator's request the executive
committee came together again to consider
the important proposition of engaging for
the campaign the vacant lot on Market
street, opposite the City Hall, where the
toboggan slide once made its noise. The
idea was to rent this space at $25 or $;50 a
month, make a canvas pavilion of it to
accommodate 5000 people and whoop
things up in it. A committee was ap
pointed to go and see it and report next
Saturday night.
CANNON, ROCKETS, FIRE,
Festivities Opened the Season for
the Pacific Yacht
Club.
The Tugs Fearless and Vigilant and
Five Launches Carry Guests
to Sausalito.
"There was a sound of revelry by night"
at Sausalito when the tug Fearless, bear
ing a host of invited guests to the ball
which opens the season for the I'acilic
Yacht Club, arrived at the little wharf in
Sausalito.
The whole scene, from the cottages
perched picturesquely upon the hillside to
the pleasure vessel anchored in the har
bor, was one red glare. Skyrockets added
to the brilliancy of the scene, and the
booming of cannon gave the element of
excitement.
About half-past B o'clock five launches â
Charles H. Crocker's Wanderer, Hugo
Kiel's Cynthia, "Will Powning's Wailele
and the Wand and the Norwood came
over from Bel vedere with full crews.
Each one bore a roclcet in his hanjl, and
as they neared the wharf these were set in
action.
Among; those present was Captain James
Bruce, who seemed to be the hero of the
evening.
The names of the guests present from
Belvedere are as follows:

A MODEL WHEEL.
The Crawford Bicycle a Popular Favor
ite in San Francisco.
The Crawford bicycle is fast becoming
popular with the riders of this City. This
wheel was first introduced into California
during the season of 1895 and has given
the best of satisfaction.
The lines of the Crawford are mechani
cally correct and symmetrical, the mate
rial used is of the best and the workman
ship unexcelled.
The company manufacturing the Craw
ford has one of the most extensive
and complete plants in this country,
and their guarantee is as broad as that
given by any reliaulc manufacturer. The
I'acitic Coast agent is Edwin Mohrig, 1510

ARTS
AND
CRAFTS
There in a good deal of originality about
the Guild of Arts and Crafts exhibition, I
which opened yesterday evening at 21 ( J j
Sutter street.
In the first place the walls are divided
into sections, and each member who is an
artist has been given his cvn bit of wall
to fill, in the manner which pleased him I
best. The result is a series of private ex
hibitions, so to speak, each of which is i
stamped with tfle originality of its owner, j
Peixotto has given vein to his decided
talent a3 a draughtsman, and has shown
principally pen and ink sketches. Lati- I
mer, Judson and some of the other busy ]
bees of the fraternity have filled every
inch of their sections with paintings, while
other painters have mad- a very few pic
tures do duty for adorning a large amount
ol wall. The result is interesting and i
characteristic, even if it is a bit hetero- j
geneous.
There were a number of people promi
nent in local art and musical circles at the i
Some of the Artists Comment on the Arts and Crafts Exhibit.
opening of the sketch exhibit last even
ing. An orchestra, under the direction of
J. Josephs, played j n an arbor improvised
of live bamboo and acacia, and the rest
of the decorations were quite in keeping
with the artistic character of the Arts and
Crafts' Guild. The platform of the hall
was quite the most admired spot in the
decorations.
It represented a studio, evidently of
some opulent and prosperous artist for its
walls were hnng with costly prayer rues
and tap strie*. its chairs were antique
and magnificent, and even the lay figure
was clad in siiK attire.
As for the pictures the spectators took
them in sections and found enough variety
and good work to carry them all round the
hall without wanting to pause to read. If
any one wanted information the committee
who had arranged the exhibit were there
ready to explain.
They were John Stanton, the president;
W. t>. Armes, secretary; Arthur F.
Mathews. the chairman of arrangements;
L. P. Latiiner, A. Joullin. E. I'eixotto.
John A. Stanton, the president, has
filled his space almost to overflowing with
sketches of Paris and Brittany. They are
done in his usual broad yet simple style,
and, as usual, show his fondness for the
decorative side of art.
A sketch of a lion's statue on the Paris
boulevard* looms un particularly strong,
but it is a pity that Mr. Stanton does not
turn his decided talent to something Cali
fornian instead of always going so far
nfield as Brittany and Paris to seek his
subjects.
Arthur Mathews has a good exhibit, in
cluding some particularly tine pastels that
are remarkable for their delicacy of color,
and there is also a particularly beautiful
little study of a child from the nude and
a couple of studies for Judith are strongly
painted.
Gamble has a number of pictures, in
cluding a girl's head, that might be a
model for a fashion-plate. He is at his
best in his marines. One in particular of a
lagoon outside of Venice is an exquisite
bit of work.
Jo Strong shows some sketches from
Samoa which are splendid bits of color,
while their technical part is excellent.
There are also ft couple of thoroughly
characteristic etchings of Joaquin Miller
and lira. Miller and a fine portrait of Reg
inald Birch, the painter's nephew.
Miss Elizabeth Strong of New York, the
animal painter, shows a painting of a pair
of dogs which is full of life and motion.
Chris Jorgensen's space is fairly well
filled. All his work snows his knowledge
of drawing, though as a rule it is rather
hard and cold in color. One or two sketches,
however, particularly the lagoon off
Venice, are good bits of color. Crane
shows two brilliant water colors.
Judson, who is a new man among the
artists here, showed a section crowded
with California sketches, which excited
most favorable comment. All his work
gives the atmosphere and color of Califor
nia, and his marines and sand dunes are
as excellent as his landscape.".
Latimer has a full exhibit, containing
principally water colors. Most of the
work is charmingly soft end artistic,
though, as a whole, it bears the impress of
the studio more than most of Latimer's
work.
Some of the pictures, however, are evi
dently careful studies from nature.
Among ttie other artists, Robinson
shows some sketches, principally of the
Yosemite, which bear the impress of hav
ing been painted far from the stuaio. The
view of Mono Lake, with its fine grada
tions of color, is particularly weird and
striking. Joullin shows some excellent
sand dunes, and Bloomer's pictures are
also honest efforts from nature. Peters has
some clever broad work and Raschen
again shows himself to be a good draughts
man.
A Lecture on Malaya.
Last Friday evening Rounsevellc Wildman,
editor of the Overland Monthly, delivered a
most interesting lecture before the Young
Men's Christian Association, at their building,
Masou and Ellis streets, on 'Malaya anil the
Sultan of Johore." Mr. Wildman's description
of this wonderland was extremely vivid and
interesting.
FOR HOME DEFENSE.
Mission Property- Owners Protecting
Their Right* Against the Noe
Litigants.
Mission Defense Club held its usual
weekly meeting at Twentieth and Guerrero
streets last night, at which a lengthy dis
cussion took place on the 2% per cent car
fare proposition. -;\
Supervisor Hobbs made a motion, which
j was seconded by Judge Van Reynegom.
! to the effect that the delegates from that
j club in tho Federation Club discounten
ance any interference with the reduction
of carfare, unless a general system of
transfers be secured by act of the Legis
| lature. This was unanimously carried.
Secretary Van Duzer stated that a de
cision had been rendered by the Twelfth
! District Court in 1860, which virtually de
â  clared that the Noe claimants had no title
! to the lands they claimed.
It was stated the Cemeteries' Associa
: tion, having for sale the two blocks of land,
' which is desired for a public park, would
i Bell directly to the City, and not permit
any middlemen to secure a commission
for the sale of the same.
Supervisor Hobbs stated that the $35,000
appropriated by the Legislature for the
purchase of a home for the inebriates
would not be expended for that purpose,
but would be turned into the general
fund at the end of the fiscal year. This
statement brought forth the remark from
Secretary Van Duzer that during the past
year no less than 1435 persons had been
arrested in this City for drunkenness, and
that he was opposed to bu'Uing a fine
house to taKe this class of dissipated in
dividuals to.
Judjje Van Reynegom offered the fol
lowing:
The Mission Defense and Improvement Union
respectfully reijuet-t and urtre upon the honor
able Board of Supervisors of San Francisco that
the action proposed by said board in bitu
mlntifag certain blocks of Dolores street be
postponed until action shall have been had
upon said petition for making Dolores street a
boulevard.
J. D. Daly, John Rolger, George Walcom,
C. Branigan and J. F. Dorland were ap
pointed a committee to wait on the Super
visors and advocate the above measure.
BROWN PREACHES TO-DAY
The Unfrocked Pastor Scheduled
to Appear in Dr. Good
win's Pulpit.
Many of the Members Are Not Pleased
With the Idea â Large At
tendance Anticipated.
If Brown is sufficiently well he will
oreach at the California-street Methodist
Church this morning at 11 o'clock. Such
was the programme agreed on at a late
hour last night.
Dr. Goodwin's flock is not by any means
unanimous as to the propriety of their
pastor's course. Those opposed to Brown's
appearance in the pulpit contend that
it is a slap at their common brethren
in Christ, which will be likely to injure
the cause of religion generally even if it
does not hurt the California-street Metho
dist Church. Most of those who think
this way will not attend the morning
service.
The trustees have not as yet received
any offers for the First Church property.
The statement made in a morning paper
yesterday to the effect that the Catholics
were makingan effort to secure the church
was probably founded on an attempt made
in that direction many years ago.
The movement on the part of Brown's
friends to start an independent church or
society has made no practical progress as
yet. They are willing and anxious to
come together in support of their un
frocked friend, but that gentleman seems
to be playing for higher game just at pres
ent. Of course, if be can do nothing bet
ter he will accept their support.
There will be no services of any charac
er whatever at the First Church to-day.
The Sunday-school and Bible class have
temporarily disbanded. The few Chris
tian Endeavorers who still cling to the
parent organization will meet in a private
residence on Bush street.
Mrs. Mary A. Davidson lectured at Odd
Fellows' Hall last night on "What He
Was Afraid Of." As one of the principal
actors in the great scandal, the speaker
was enabled to throw light in places
hitherto shrouded in mystery. A medium
sized audience greeted Mrs. Davidson.
The fashion for snuff-taking became
general in France in the early part of the
reign of Louis XV, although Louis was a
bitter discourager of snuff-taking. His
valets were obliged to renounce it when
they were appointed to their office.
IN THE MURDERER' ROW
Nine Man-Killers Who Now

A Dark Chapter cf Crime and Blood
From the Condemned Cells at
San Quentin.
With death upon the gallows staring
him in the face "Kid" Thompson, the Ros
coe train-wrecker, is still the most profane
and toughest prisoner now confined in the
State prison at San Quentin. His execu
tion ia set. for the 22d inst. and he views
his fast-approaching end with the stoicism
of an American Indian.
Of the nine murderers now under the
death penalty in the prison across the bay
the "Kid" is the only one who has given
up all hope of saving his neck by process
of law or the Governor's clemency.
The Roscoe train wreck and the sacri
fice of life that followed are still fresh in
the minds of the public. Thompson's
partner, Johnson, turned State's evidence
and is now serving a life sentence.

Thompson's indifference to the fated
22d was explained yesterday in a conver
sation with Dan Sullivan, one of the
guards inside of the walls. To the guard
he said :
What is the use of me trying to fijfht the
case? If they don't stretch my neck here, they
will be sure to in New Mexico. The officers
huve a dead case on me there, so they say.
You see, down in Albuquerque, some fellows
made a raid on one of the banks and got away
with $1400, after killing the cashier and shoot
ing several others. The bank robbers escaped
but were pursued by a pos9e. The officers run
them down, and in the light, one officer and
one robber were killed. The robber who was
killed was my cousin. The other escaped. Now
they say J am the other fellow, and I guess
they would prove that I was, but I was not
within mile? of New Mexico at the time.
Neither was I in the Roscoe train affair, for I
was sick in bed at the time. lam convicted on
one charge and would be on the other, bo I
may as well swing here as to prolong the
agony. I have been a tough citizen aud had
niy fun. Now I will pay for having a bad name.
Sc the days and hours go by, and the
Kid counts them as they pass without hope
or any regret save oneâ that he cannot
live long enough to EÂ«t even on the rail
road company, which he holds responsible
for obtaining the evidence that landed
him at tcie foot of the gallows. But he is
only one of nine men now under the
penalty of death.
The next toughest citizen there is Frank
C. Kloss, who a few months ago de
liberately cut William Deady's throat in a
saloon in Hayes Valley. Kloss has hope
that the Supreme Court will assist him in
escaping the penalty of his crime or that
the Governor will prolong his years by
commuting the sentence to imprisonment
for life.
There is one in whom the Governor is
interested. It is Dennis McCarthy, a San
Francisco boy who shot a ranch hand to
death in Sonoma County for a fancied of
fense. Medical experts say that McCarthy
is weak-minded and subject to epilepsy.
His case is now on appeal to the Supreme
Court, and if the death penalty is sus
tained it is said that Governor Wudd will
interfere with the execution.
The Cummings brothers, John and Cse
sar, from Riverside, are hoping to be
spared from paying tbe penalty for mur
der, and their execution is stayed by pro
ceedings in the Supreme Court. 'These
brothers rented a ranch from an old man,
and when he went to collect the rent one
slipped away and returned with a mask
and played robber. He hit the land
owner on the head and took the money
his brother had just paid. The blow
proved fatal, and the robbery story might
have held, but the plot was revealed by a
Mexican in the Cummings' employ.
A case almost parallel is that of Marshall
Miller, also under the sentence of death.
Miller and Stewart Green assaulted an
aged pawnbroker in Marynviile for the
purpose of robbery. The blow broke the
money-lender's skull. Green turned State's
evidence and is now under life sentence.
Miller's case is before the Supreme
Court on an appeal for a new trial. If the
prayer is not granted Miller will have to
be re-sentenced, as the original date of his
execution is passed.
Charles Marshall, who owned a fourth
interest in the famous Desert Queen gold
mine, also wants a new trial. He Killed a
man in a saloon at Riverside during a row.
There are two men whose necks may be
spared. One is William Leary, who killed
a man in a saloon row in Salinas. Leary
is now 78 years of age and the Governor
has spared his life t>y a reprieve.
The other is Bruno Morosco, who killed
an Italian near Vacavilie over two years
ago. He too has been saved by the Gover
nor. Leary is too old to work but Morosco
is employed in the jute mill.
All of the other condemned live in mur
derers' row; a row of strong cells on the
north side of the prison in sight of the of
ficers of the inside guard. Once or twice

afternoon.
"Give me a license, a bicycle license," he
said to the clerk.
"How long have you had your wheel?"
asked the latter.
"Oh, I've had it a good while, but that
don't matter. Give me a license that will
be good all the rest of this year and I'll bo

owned the wheel prior to April 1. Tbe

CLOSE OF THE WOMAN'S CONGRESS.

Meetings the Convention Adjourns
for a Year.
A FAREWELL SURPEISE
Great Enthusiasm Is Mani

Sessions.
MIBS SHAW SHOWS SPIEIT.
Eleven Fina Papers Read and a
Stirring Address Given by
Miss Anthony.
Joist Campaign Committee, )
Headquarters, lt!3O Folsom street, >
BAM Fhaxcisco, May 9.)
The nine days' talk in regard to the action
of the Republican convention in adopting a
woman suffrage plank has not yet ended, and
the committee of women who went up to
Sacramento are besieged with inquiries as to
how it was done. The only answer to be made
is that "it did itself." We established our
headquarters on the taird floor of the Golden
Eagle Hotel, opened our parlor, lighted a
cheerful fire in the grate; the ladies of Sacra
mento sent in quantities of flower;;, we spread
cut our literature, put our boxes of badges on
the center table, and then sat down in our
rocking-chairs and waited. We had decided
not to down in tlie lobby to "buttonhole" the
delegates, but to stand on our dignity and let
them come to us. There was no other head
quarters on that floor, and they would have to
make the trip on purpose to see us. Suppose
they did not come '.
But in a short time a prominent editor ap
peared and then the rush commenced. From
Tuesday noon until the close of the conven
tion there was a steady stream of delegates, in
twos and threes, and in whole delegations.
Sometimes a chairman would come up and say
the others were too busy to cail. but had sent
tim for badges for the entire delegation.
Wednesday morning 250 delegates were wear
ing woman-suffrage badges, and our supply
was exhausted. At least fifty more could have
been used.
Only once did we go to the floor below and
that was when we were invited to address the
platform committee. I wish I could picture
that scene. In the small room, seated or stand
ing around the table, were the seven men who
held the fate of this question in tbeir hands.
At one end of the table stood Miss Anthony,
the light from above shining upon her silver
hair till it seemed like a halo around her
head, and she spoke as no one ever heard her
speak before.
On the face of every delegate was an expres
sion of the deepest seriousness, and before she
hed finished tears were in the eyes of more
than one of them. She was followed by Miss
Shaw, who stood there the embodiment of all
that is pure, sweet and womanly, and in a
low clear voice presented the cause as no one
else could have done. As we were about to
leave the room the chairman said: "Ladies,
we will take the vote now if you desire." We
thanked him but said no, we would with
draw and leave them to consider the matter at
their leisure.
Within a very few minutes we had their de
cision, six in favor of the resolution and one
opposedâ Kidder of Grass Valley. We violate
no confidence in giving his name, as he went
down info the lobby and publicly proclaimed
the fact. Here I want to call attention to one
thing. Eight women knew of the favorable
action of the committee by 9 o'clock, but al
though we were be sieged by reporters and del
egates until nearly midnight we gave no sign,
and the Wednesday morning papers could
only say that it was probable there would be a
woman suffrage plank. It is said that women
cannot keep a secret, but this is one of those
many ancient myths that takes a long time to
die.
How were we treated? Just as ladies are
treated who hold a reception in their drawing
room. Not one discourteous word or action
during the entire convention, only the most
profound respect. There was more than re
spect; there were hearty encouragement and
helpfulness, and more compliments than we
tared to bear. We would not have it under-
Etood tnat we believed implicitly all that was
Eaid to us, but the final action of the conven
tion spoke louder than words.
The convention-hall was clean, cool and
beautiful with flowers and bunting. There
was no smoking and no disorderly conduct.
There were many women present, and the sur
roundings were much more agreeable than at
the majority of mass-meetings for various pur
poses which women attend without any com
ment.
Tne meeting was more orderly and decorous,
If we are to judge from the telegraphic reports,
than a great religious convention now in ses
sion, which is not willing to permit a woman
to sit among its delegates. As we entered the
hall we noticed on every banner which marked
a delegation three white stars on a blue
ground. We did not know what they might
signify, but to us they said, "Wyoming, Colo
rado, Utah"â the three States where women

The convention throughout was for us an

Emancipation. '
enjoyable one. We listened with close atten
tion to the bursts of eloquence displayed In
the nominating speeches, but we wondered why
in those nominating Mr. Grant the orators
spent ah tbeir breath in extolling the Illus
trious father, but had not one word to say in
praise of the proposed delegate, except that he
was the son of bis father.
We were very much grieved to learn from
our waiter at the hotel that he should not vote
for woman suffrage, as he did not think women
were smart enough to votel We had a young
fellow to do our errands, look after ournre,
etc., and he surprised us by saying one day
that he thought he ought to tell us that be
could not give us his vote this fall, as he did
not think women were prepared for suffrage!
We asked him if women who could come up
there and do the work we were doing were not
intelligent enough to use the ballot. He said
be thought we were awfully smart women, out
not smart enough to vote. Finding â¢that he
was a Republican we inquired if all the wise
men attending the convention should decide
that we ought to have the ballot, whether he
then would vote for it. He thought he would,
and finally decided to put on the badge. I re
fer to theee instances simply to illustrate the
humiliations to which progressive, educated
women are subjected.
As soon as the convention closed there was a
wild rush for the train, and when we got
aboard the cars were crowded. At least a
dozen delegates, tired as they were, sprang up
and insisted upon putting us in their seats,
and after we were comfortably seated they
came to us from another car and told us they
had arranged to have us all ait together there.
We went forward and took those seats, and
then the other men came in to know why we
left their car. At the Benicia ferry a delegate
from Tulare brought a lunch to us, and in
every possible way our comfort and conveni
ence were attended to. These are but small
things, yet 1 relate them because one of the
bugbears held up before the advocates of
woman suffrage is that when women get the
right to vote they will be allowed to stand up
in cars, etc.
We believe that they will be treated with
even more delerence and respect when they
are no longer classed politically with crimin
als, idiots and insane, and when their opinions
and wishes are considered of sufficient value
to be accorded the same weight in public af
fairs as are tttose of men. We make the pre
diction that after a few years' experience of
woman suffrage in California all o! these old
objections will appear so utterly weak and ab
surd that people will wonder how they ever
could have made them or believed in them.
On Monday we go to the Populist Convention
at Sacramento and on Thursday to the Prohi
bition Convention at Stockton. We have every
assurance from the leaders of these parties
that our appearing before them will be a mere
act of formality and courtesy, as woman suf
frage is one of their fundamental principles.
The statement is frequently made by Popu
lists, and appeared in The Call a few days
ago, that, while they are in full sympathy with
suffrage and will work for it, they are not
oblivious to the fact that, as soon as it was
given to the women of Colorado, they over
threw the Populist party in that State. This is
not a fair statement. It is true that Â».t the tirst
election where women voted in Colorado the
Republican party scored a victory, but this
alsowasdone iv Kansas, where women have
no vote whatever in State elections. The
Populist party was as fully in control in Kan
sas as in Colorado. Whenever there comes a
time of great financial stress the party in
power is always charged with being the cause
of it, no matter what party it may be. Colo
redo and Kansas were passing through such a
period of depression, and in both States the
people overthrew the administration, in hopes
of securing better times. The Populist women
doubtless stood by their party in as large a
proportion as did the Populist men. It was
simply one of thoss landslides which are apt at
any time to turn down any party.
Ida A. HARriR,
Chairman Press Committee.
A plowing bower of pink environed the
fair participants in yesterday's session of
the Woman's Congress. Sweet Castilian
ruses blossomed everywhere, save in some
nooks and corners graced by dainty pink
carnations and flesh-tinted sweet peas.
Mrs. Emma Seckle Marshal! read the
first paper, taking for her subject "Women
as Citizens." There was something Bingu
larly lucid in her presentation of the sub
ject. She said :
"You have heard if you have been in
attendance during the week the history of
woman ; her growth as a sex; the unfold
ing of her character; the processeb of the
broadening and strengthening of her men
tality; how, even in the days of her most
abject slavery she was the staff upon
which man leaned for support, for had she
not then tilled the soil, ground the acorns
and maize, grubbed the roots and per
formed the various menial tasks how
would the poor creatures who depended
on her strength and energy for food and
shelter have existed?
"When one-half the world is dependent
on the other why should either half assert
their superiority ? Man without woman is
like unto what the earth would be deprived
of the suns warmth, and, I will admit,
vica versa. Therefore, if men whom we
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 10, 1896.
have cared for, educated and encouraged,
are entitled to certain man-conferred priv
ileges the same should be considered the
prerogative of women.
"It has beer asserted by some men, and
women too, who are, strange to say, among
the thinkers of the age, that Nature made
man physically the stronger because on
him was to devolve the care and mainten
ance of dependent beings, hence, they say,
it is but in line with the intention of
nature that he should represent the weaker
portion of humanity in a legal phase :
that, as he is the bread-winner and natural
protector so must be assume ana exercise
the functions of government.
"But 1 do not believe that the Creator in
tended man to exercise a jurisprudence
over woman simply because she was not
as big and strong and robust as he is.
Nature's God is never unjust, and there is
nothing in the world to prevent man from
protecting and guarding woman if she
rises to the dignity of a legal citizen. It
certainly should not detract from her
womanly qualities or make her one whit
less sweet aud lovable.
"It is not so many years since co-educa
tion was considered unwise, and even to
day, women are excluded from some of
our highest institutions of learning, but
they have proved their ability to contest
collegiate honors with the other sex, and
our colleges and universities which receive
young women on an equal footing with
young men have reason to be proud of the
attainments of one equally with the other.
Then why should the woman who divides
class honors with the man be his inferior
in but the one thing, the ability to be a
good citizen?
â¢'ln this connection let me cite an instance '
that occurred one week aÂ«ro to-day. A
husband and wife presented themselves
before the commissioners of the Supreme
Court for examination for admission to the
bar. The wife had become interested
from hearing her husband read aloud, and
concluded that she, too, would take up
the study of law.
"The examination proved that the know- ,
ledge of the wife was far superior to that
of the husband, and one of the commis- ;
sioners in speaking of the fact afterward
exclaimed enthusiastically: 'Of all the
applicants that I have examined for ad
mission to the bar, and I have been ou j
"THE CALL" HAS GAINED A MULTITUDE OF FRIENDS.
the bench for upwards of twenty- five
years, that lady was one of the very Dest.'
Now the point I wish to make is this. She
is the mother of growing children who
are models of obedience, and who prove
by their manner and bearing the true
motherhood that has guided them.
"Take our criminal records and look
them over. In California the census shows
that the female population is nearly equal
to that of the male, yet in the peniten
tiaries of the State there are at Ban
Quentin 1250 male prisoners and fifteen
female prisoners. Last summer I visited
the State's prison of Nevada and found
that, while nearly every cell in the men's
department of that institution was oc
cupied, there was but one woman prisoner,
and she was incarcerated for having killed
her betrayer.
"If women are lesslaw-abidingthan men
or defy the laws equally with men why
are they not equally punished with men'?
Are our peace officers, our judges and our
junta, the latter composed of 'the peers
of the realm' who are sworn to uphold
the honor and justice of our country, more
partial to the female transgressor than the
male? And if this is so. why? for it is
conceded than when a woman loses her
''"â¢respect and her position in society
she sinks to lower levels of criminality
than docs a man.
"And is this the reason that, limited as
are .the accommodations provided for
women in our penitentiaries, they are
more tr.an ample for the number assigned
to them?
"The brain that can expend the small in
come of the artisan or laborer in a mas
terly manner can certainly comprehend as
much mystery and intricacy as the brain
that guides the hand that earns that in
come. He brings hiÂ» wages horne â we are
speaking now of the exemplary man â and
as tho wife expends them so does the fam
ily iucceed or fail. Her brain carries the
details of butcher, baker and candlestick
maker, etc., to Â»ay nothing of the rent or
installments on the little home they are
buying ; she has to plan for the shoes and
hats and suitable clothes of their growing
children ; to keep in condition the gar
ments of her husband ; to see that variety
marks his daily meals; to note the symp
toms of illness in her little ones, and
though she hovers over the beds of fever
ish babies in the still watches of the night,
yet must she keep well oiled the machinery
that operates her household affair?. Who
will tell me that the woman who accom
plishes this â and her name is legionâ is
unfitted to make a good citizen?
"The requisites for a good citizen consist
in a thorough comprehension of his duties
to his country, his family and his feliow
men* an understanding of the needs
of his Government and an honest
endeavor to do his part toward accom
plishing the satisfying of those needs by
casting an intelligent, honest ballot. Is
there anything in these requisites to pre
vent a woman from being a good citizen?"
Mrs. Miller ot Oakland opened the dis
cussion by saying that tne type of woman
described by Mrs. Marshall would make a
splendid public officer.
A lady in the gallery opined that the
husband could never represent the wife at
the polls.
Mrs. Hall saiu she would like to bear
her testimony of agreement with the gal
lery lady's remarks and said woman's
cause was an attempt for the good of all;
it was not for an expediency of good gov
ernment; it was all riplit enough for a
man to eat a meal, but that meal dia the
woman no good, and so it was with politi
cal risrhts.
"I suppose," observed Miss Severance,
"that woman is citizen enough to pay
taxes, and if she has no husband she may
perhaps take up land, but when It comes
to the actual rights of citizenship, woman's
position is peculiar. She's in it, and she
isn't in it, and she don't know where she
is at all."
"Women, 1 ' commented Miss Manning,
"are said to be very free in France. In
exchange for their freedom the French
woman gave the voting and law-making
power into the Hands of the men. As a
result France has some of the most vil
lainous laws in relation to woman that
have ever been enacted."
"I know a man in Oakland," said Mrs.
Van Pelt, "who has never voted since his
marriage, and he says he never will until
his wife can 20 with him to the polls."
"Do you tfiink t: at man will vote next
November?" inquired Miss Severance.
"He most certainly will," was Mrs. Van
Pelt's answer, which" was applauded to the
echo.
"Housekeeping and City-keeping" gave
Miss Harriet May Mills of New York City
the theme for a brilliant address. She
said in part:
The growth of civilization has been a remark
able prowth In the last century. In Washington's
time only 3 per cent of thÂ« population lived In
eitlfs, but now 10 per cent live in the elites oi the
United states.
We know that city-keeping is nothing but house
keeping on a larger scale, and yet men for a whole I
century have left out of consideration this im
portant element of management, 'lhe home man
agement, the many undertakings women have
entered, show that they are good managers. They
are used to making a very little go a long way, for
they have not liad much money to manage with ;
and they are economical. I
In New York I remember driving for years over
a street with boles la It and they always grew
bigger until finally the men got an epidemic Of
pavement laying and paved every street and lane.
What's more, women are more cieanly in iran
aeement. Their handling of bouses shows that
they know more about sweeping than men who
have so lone superintended the wretched street
1 sweeping systems.
S What we need is not only sanitation and better
sanitation, but the cultivation of a taste for the
beautiful. Any man that will sacrifice the beauti
ful trees and the natural contour of the City Is not !
fit to hold the position that controls such things.
Street-sweeping is too often made a matter of
' political affiliation. We wouldn't have a conk sim
ply because she would howl for some particular
candidate or party in favor.
It yon were In a city where a School Superinten
dent could not read or write you might feel that
woman ought to have a hand. Woman should
have some part in the management of the school
system. Men always make a mistake when they
try to keep house alone, and that is what they have
done in attempting the management of cities.
There |ia no good clty-keepinK In which good
housekeeping is not recognized as an Important
part. It would save us from tilth, from a great
deal of disease, and It would save mcn;irom a great
deal of the responsibility.
We don't expect to reform the city management
all in a minute, but we do believe It will result
eventually lrom the joint management of men and
women. â â 
Miss Manning took occasion here to ex
press herself on a topic of the day sug
gested by Mrs. Mills' speech. . She said:
If women were sharers in . San Francisco's gov
ernment could the City papers have come out this
morning with the announcement of the disgraceful
removal of t he most efficient officials that have ever
served in this City. Mr. and Mrs Weaver, the su
perintendent and matron of the Almshouse?
Several other persons commented on the
paper, after which Mrs. Alice Moore Mc-
Comas spoke, in part as follows, on "The
Right of Representation."
That there should be a question of the right of
representation in a republic founded as Is ours,
upon the principle of ''freedom and equality," Is
truly remarkable. It is contrary to the spirit of
our government to question the political rights of
any of onr people. Therefore 1 claim that Ameri
can women are entitled to everr right possessed
by American men. In making this assertion, con
trary to our usual political practice, yet perfectly
In harmony with republican ideasâ ln oertect ac
cord with the fundamental principles of our
governmentâ it Is right and proper that I a tempt
t<> show that it is reasonable and not dangerous to
our public interests.
There is no belter way to do this than to show by
oar .National constitution that women are entitled
to the right of representation. Article XIX. section
l.sa.vK: â â All persons born or na uralized in the
Inited atates, and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof, are citizens of the United states, and of
the State wherein they reside. No Nlate shall
make or enforc- any law wntch shall abridge the
privileges or immunities of citizens, nor shull any
Htatedeprhra any person of life, liberty or prop<-rty
wlthout due process of law, nor deny to any person
within Us jurisdiction the equal -irbtection cf the
laws." And again: "All governments derive
their Just powers from the consent of the
governed."
The American woman bases her claim to the
right of representation upon the Declaration of in
dependence, which was uot a declaration of re vo

lutlonary war. but of a new political philosophy.
The inalienable rights therein declared are not
liuiltabl? by sex, and she questions the intention
of our forefathers to so cous^ .rue them. Woman
has the same right to life, liberty and property
tha* man hi-s. Has she not an equal right to pro
tection? This Is tho right of 3Uffrftj?e. If she has
a natural right to life, liberty and the pursuit of
bappiness, then she should have a natural or ac
quired right to everything that secures to her the
use of thes>> rightsâ just as man busâ provided this
does not harm the equal right of another.
1 ask the men here assembled if yon hare to a
certainty ascertained that you are entitled to
any Uod-givm, natural rights that are speci
fied prohibitions to women? Have you any
claim o protection that Is justly denied to
women? Gentlemen of the Golden Stateâ
you who arc famous the world over for gene
rosity and chivalry, whose pride in your women
stands as one of your most jtracefcl virtuesâ
we ask that you establish such a government in
our stat*. We ask mat you no longer permit
this "Shadow on the face of the Princess" to re
main.
Woman are part of the people of California.
They ask that the grand declarations of the found
ers of this great State be no longer considered as
glittering generalities. Verify them at the polls
next November by enfranchising yonr intelligent
women.
There is too much said about woman's "holy
mission" and not enough about her pnu t eal duty
to her country; there is too much said of man's
patriotism and public service and not enongb
about his '-holy mission" as the father of his race.
A little mingling of these duties and missions,
and more interchange of mutnal Interests would
give us an improved system of government in the i
home and the state. You have seen a household j
bereft of a mother and have watched tne dis
tracted fnther try to do for the children what the
mother had done. You have seen a home de>
prived of a father and witnessed the broken
hearted mother's attempt to take his place. No
matter how great the effort, neither of these homes
are liks homes where each day husband and wife
gave iheir best strenglit and thought to the welfare
of the family. Does our government differ from our
household? Do we no! love our country as our
home?
Our opponents say, "Universal suffrage Is con
trary to law," "acain3t nature," '-no! sanctioned
by scripture," and "means revolution."
Yes, everything now Is a revolution. Revolu
tion and evolution are the mainsprings of civiliza
tion.
When Sir Samuel Rom My proposed to abolish
the death penalty for stealing a handkerchief it
r.-as feared It. would endanger the whole criminal
c<vle. When the tiiil abolishing the slave trade
passed the House of Lords, Lord St. Vincent left
the House, saying he washed his hands Of the
downfall of the British Empire.
When the nrÂ»t steamer floated down the Thames
It was declared against nature! When at the
close of tne reign of Charles ri London had a half
million people, there was a fierce struggle against
street lamps.
In 182b. when some enterprising young men
wanted to hire a "meeting house' 11 â not a thousand
miles from New Yorkâ to hold a debate on rall-
I roads, the slow-going deacons, after prayerful de
! liberation, sent a note of refusal, saying, "You are
cheerfully welcome to our meeting-house to de
bate all proper questions, but such things as rail
roads are Impossibilities! There Is muhing in the
Scriptures about th-m. If God had designed his
intelligent creatures should travel Â«t the frightful
rate of fifteen miles an hour by steam he would
I have foretold It by his holy prophets. It Is a de
! vice of !-atan to lead Immortal soul* to perdition !"
I \\ c can scarcely believe such loollsb men ever
I lived! Yet the time Is not far distant when a truly
enlightened people, enjoying the privileges of a
| truly Republican Government, will be doubting
the existence of men who questioned woman's
right of representation.
Miss Yates, opening the discussion, told
of a man in the employ ot a wealthy
, lady graduate of Vassar College who went
to cast bis first vote after an instan
1 tatieous naturalization. Hi 9 mistress
1 asked him bow he had votÂ».d. it tran-
I spired that be had cast bis first tax re*
ceiptinto the ballot-box.
"I caa give a little incident myself,"
said Mrs. Marshall.
"I applied for the position of proof
reader of a great register of one of our
i counties, as I had been assistant on the
previous issue, but I was refused, as I was
told, because I w.as not a voter. They
gave the position to a man, and he found
he could not get it out on time and he had
to send for me."
Miss Mabel Craft, a graduate of the Uni
versity of California, offered some perti
nent remarks on women's wages. She
said tnat in all the positions requiring
what is known as brain work the women
of California receive compensation equal
to that men receive, but that ift other em
ployment the women competing with
men 00 not receive nearly so much pay
as the men. In teaching and in journal
ism women receive as good wages as men
and in some cases better because of better
work, but in stores poor giris who have to
help out the family at home work for $4 a
week. It would not be possible for them
to live on such wages, but they are adding
a little to the furnishings of brothers and
father. Women will never know political
economy, she concluded, until they are
able to vote; until they refuse to take "work
unless the pay is fair.
The last paper of tho morning session
was by Miss Sarah M. Severance, wno
spoke on "The Reaction of Injustice" in
the following strain :
Action and reaction are equal, and Injustice to
woman i: as reacted upon man in full measure
pressed down. Neither is responsible except for
its continuance, for It Is an inheritance, but wrong
woman and retributive justice follows on the
tract of her sons and grandsons. Not only is
tin re general retribution, but tne individual suf
fers. All intelligent people are Interested In poli
tics. The club-woman knows all about the laws of
iioses, of Lycurgus, of Solon, the Twelve Tables,

Her husband is for or against McKinley and Is
disgracefully ignorant of Moses, the great law
giver. Combine their knowledge and how bright
the word would be. He thinks and wants an out

The husband needs woman "suffrage The chil

when groat things are settled, so in the great
things the son calls not for her opinions. The wife
needs it. She needs an outing from function, irom
her personal cares: a participation in great things
will give her what she needsâ breadth, perspective.
The Notion needs It. Men cannot cope with nature
alone; he must organize, his work, is largely ma

The industrial world needs it. Man can never
compete with slavery, be It bond, chattel, serf or
sexâ sex slavery brings industrial slavery for wo

lift her off by giving her equality. They were the
first and are our best friends.
Morality needs It. Take from woman her o*rn

Miss Severance's paper was agreed to

said, "and the Report was quick to follow

AFTERNOON SESSION.
Some Bright Papers and an Inter
estlns Symposium on "The
New Citizenship."
The crowd at the afternoon session was
the largest yet seen at any meeting of the
congress. ThoÂ»e who packed themselves
into the hall numbered about half the
multitude who failed to effect an entrance.
"Women sat along the front of the stage
and on the reporters' tables, their feet and
flounces waving in mid-air, while one ad
venturous young lady from, across the bay
took an exalted perch oa the gallery rail
ing, making, though she knew it not, a
most remarkable festoon of herself,
A letter from Mrs. Mary F. McÃoberts
of Leeds, Yorkshire, England, was read
by the president. It was a message of
spirited congratulation to the women of
the congress, and an expression of hearty
sympathy with the cause.
Mrs. Harriet W. Russell Strong, the
planter and owner of the largest walnut
orchard in the world, the* only woman on
the Los Angelea Cnamber of Commerce
and it is composed of 700 members, and a
member of a prominent literary society of
that city, had the first paper on the pro
gramme for the afternoon session. She
departed entirely from the common theme
of woman and suffrage ana in a thought
ful and forcible way discussed "Rights of
Property and Rights of Persons." In part
bhe said:
Property Is, broadly speaking, anything that we
peases: or own. In the beginning of tradition
there Â«m no ownership except in continuous pos
session of a thing.
Half of the property of this country Is deprived of
a voiceâ half of the population placed in a position
here they are powerless to speak for their prop
erty rights. Half the population of our country is
tried and punished, deprived of personal liberty
and property whnout due process of law, in all
States of our Union but three.
Mrs. Pages of Alameda gave a glowing
picture what the world would be after
woman should be accorded her rightful
position in the body politic
A Mr. Jackson said women were more
responsible than men for existing evil
condition?, since women had much to do
with the formation of the religious senti
ment in man, which sentiment, he con
tended, woman had allowed to become
perverted.
A symposium on "The New Citizenship"
then took place, the speakers being Mrs.
A. A. Sargent, Mrs. John P. Swift, Miss
Conners and Miss Mills.
Mrs. Sargent said the new citizen would
never refer to politics as a filthy pool,
since through the endeavors of his kind
politics would have been purilied.
"The new citizen would not stoop to
scorn his mother as an inferior beinÂ«Â».
The sex line will not be the demarcation
between political classes. The new citizen
ship will bring about a time when men
and men and women and women and
men and women shall be able to meet and
look eacn other in the eye without fear or
false sname."
Mrs. Swift quoted President Lincoln's
words as to a government by and for the
people.
"Who," she asked, "are the people?
Are we to believe that tne brave ana gal
lant women of past and contemporary his
tory are unfit to be counted among the
people? Can they not be regarded as citi
zens of this great Nation? It is said, I
know, that woman's dignity would suffer
at the polls, but I have faith enough in the
chivalry of the American man, and I am
sure he would permit no one's mother,
wife or sister to be insulted at the ballot
box.
"Chivalry would not disappear had wo
man the ballot. In Wyoming woman suf
frage is regarded as a matter of course and
women have lost nothing by it. But when
a bad man gets on the ticket the women
spot him ana down him every time."
â  Miss Mollie Conners, lady editor of the
Oakland Saturday Night, evoke next.
Among other bright things she said :
"So you are going to get a new suit, I suppose,
end going to that congress across the bay to talk
â woman's rights, 1 " said a suffrage Infidel and a
brother editorâ a man rich in this world's goods
and not poor in brain possession either. "Women
do not have new â¢suits'â they leave that for
manâ they have gowns Instead, you know. But
no new gown will I have. It was eaten up by a
family of live children last week, likewise mv new
spring bonnet. I snail simply take my bast jacket
off from the peg and go my way to the fair. 1 can
not have good clothes when the children about
me know want, distress."
"That Is why the women will never make a ana.
cess in the outer world-thelr sympathies run
away with them, you know," said my editor
brother, who was hÂ«althy, wealthy and wise
'Well go your way to talk 'woman's rights ' "
As to the -woman's rights' that is anoM old
story, In the great cry of distress rising from a'suf
ferim; Nationâ the keynote is men's rightsâ the
rights they have seen slowly drlf tins away from
them In this great republic, and it is not a question
of woman's sympathy, It is lindlng out first causes
and the remedy for existing evils. In touch with
the spirit of the times Is this movement for a new
citizenship, especially so, coming from the West
the great suffering West which lies prostrate un
der conditions pitiable In the extreme, In a land
which we have learned to believe great, free, pros
perous.
When the man of the house fails in business the
women of the house arc sorry for him; they give
him love, affection, sviiiji .thy, but they lave lost
confidence in his financial ability, and when lie be
gins agala they want a share In the financial coun
cils: they watch ciosely Jest financial failure again
overtake them. That Is the attitude of the Ameri
can woman to-day. She has love, affection, sym
pathy for the American man. but she says to him.
financially you have made the Nation a failure:
you must let me help yon in lite time that is to
come: now, when we are struggling to our feet, In
the midst of the deepest financial depression that
any country has ever Known. ,
â¢ â ilia American woman is the proudest woman on
carth â proud of her country, proud of the men who
are the husbands, brothers and fathers in It.
Hut from the background of home she can
study; It Is Intellectual stiength which she can
contribute to the new citizenship; she can cast her
ballot uuderstandlnglv she an rescue her nation.
God grant that iv the day of the new citizenship
we will not see the Goddess of J.iberty prostrate at
the feet of the British lion, but with eagle in hand
towering proudly above the American people,
whose symbol she is. II the American woman
has anything to say In the future it will mean that
the British lion will keep his place, and that ills
place will be on the other side of the water. Never
again will he roar In American ear*
Miss Mill said:
'â¢We hear much of the >i eadful polls,
but I am sure we have nothing to fear from
the chivalric honor of American man
hood. I congratulate the people of Cali
fornia on the noble stand whi< h thj better
element among them have tak^n.'iQ
"I voted once," said Mis* Anthony, in
answer to repeated calls. "In my bwn
city of Rochester fifteen of us caÃt our
ballots. In only one rfrecinct could we
get our votes in the box, and so noble were
the inspectors that they would not allow
us to vote until we had guaranteed to pay
their fines and keep them out of jail in
| case the election was declared illegal..
j Tli at was in November, 1872.
"On the evening of Thanksgiving day
I was arrested. Then I was hustled about
from post to pillar, from court to court,
for days and weeks, until at last I was
sentenced to pay $100 fine and costs of
prosecution. I told the Judge 1 had hon
| est debts to pay ; but so help me heaven.
! never would I pay a dime of the fine.
I The inspectors were lined $25 as against
! mv if 100â that's the rule, you know. [Great
I laughter.] The Judge did not commit me
to prison, and the fines were never paid.
The boys were released by the President,
through the intervention of Senator A. A.
Sargent and of old Ben Butler; and there
the affair ended."
"Did ymi pay the fine?" inquired a lady
in the audience.
"No, I didn't," answered Aunt Susan
witn some spirit, "and I never will. lam
still a prisoner at large."
A paper on "Woman in Europe" by
Mrs. Henrotin of Chicago was read by Miss
Humphrey-Smith and listened to with the
deepest interest.
The Rev. Anna Shaw was announced to
speak on "Private-spirited Mothers," but
sue disclaimed any desire to make a set
1 speech. At the same time she made one,
! and a line one it was. Among other things
i she said:
"It has been said that no worklnjr
! woman or man has spoken from this plat
j form. That is an ertor. All the women
on this stage know what real work is.
Since I was fifteen years old I have never
hud a gown or a week's board witiiout pay-
Ing for it with my own earnings."
The question-basket was then called into
! requisition, and many of the queries
evoked tempests of laughter. Among the
inquiries was the following:
"Is it true that The Call is getting up a
monster petition for equal suffrage?"
"My! Isn't The Call great!" ejaculated
Miss Shaw.
"I don't know," she resumed, in answer
to the question, "what The Call may be
doing, but we all know what it has done.
And a more gracious, graceful and chival
rous stand was never taken by any greut
paper than that to which The Call com-
I mitted itself last Sunday. Perhaps it is
I getting up monster petitions or something
j e.'se of that kind. At ail events we may
j be sure it is working for our cause in its
! own way, and a very good way that has
I proved to be thus Yar. We look to The
| Call for aid and encouragement, and we
j know we shall not be disappointed."
EVENING SESSION.
Professor Powers Gives a Closing
Surprise to the Ladles of
the Congress.
An immense crowd gathered in Native
Sons' Hall at the closing session of the
congress, the place being packed long be
fore the exercises commenced.
Professor H. H. Powers of Stanford Uni
versity read a paper having for its theme
the question "Ho y; Far Is Woman Adapted
and Adaptable to Political Functions?"
The essay was rather a surprise to many
of those present and called forth much
adverse criticism. It was in part as fol
lows:
How far is woman adapted and adaptable to
political functions? I approach the question with
flitlldence, knowing that 1 shall give occasion fur
pleasantry to those who are so dlspo-ed. Aside
from the physiology of ccx there are sundry
characteristics of women not so obviously con
nected with the sex functions. It is the second Â«ry
characters and functions which it is proposed to
modify, the primary ones being unalterable.
First of all woman is somewhat smaller and
weaker than man, though the difference is one of
kind as well as one of degree. She excels in en
j durance long continued as man doe* in violent.
[ Intense action. Woman's esthetic perceptions are
! quicker and more delicate and ii tÂ»nse. Woman's
1 moral pre-eminence is often exaggerated.
"Forty-rive years ago," commented Miss
Anthony, "for I am not young, a girl
attended Oberlin College. She was a
i younger sister of Antoinette Brown, the
first woman ever ordained to the ministry.
The professor of political economy, Fair
child by name, now president of that
institution, condemned slave labor. Young
Miss Brown told him slave labor was on a
par with the unpaid work of a married
woman. But he didn't see it that way.
Of course not. How could he ?
"And now comes this college professor
to tell us that if we figure in public no
man will marry us. What a pity! But
men have married women of strong minds
and stout hearts before now, and will con
tinue to do so, all things to the contrary
notwithstanding."
Mrs. Emma Gregory spoke of women
composers, artists and writers.
"I wonder," observed Miss Manning,
"if the professor has heard of Mrs. Brown
ing, of Clara Schumann, of Rosa Bonheur
and so many others?"
Miss Shaw was to have spoken on
"Children of a Larger Growth," but she
gave fair warning that she would do
nothing of the kind, and proceeded to
demolish Professor Powers' points in this
wise :
If a woman hasn't a right not to marry, what is
marriage? And from the picture we've had of
marriage to-night, 1 suDpose that every unmarried
woman is long. for it, I have always been told
that it was an evidence of a superior mind to wish
to associate with superior people. What is superi
ority, anyhow? *
A woman can hang closer to her husband while
he goes lower and lower in debauchery and drunk
enness, until she finally gets him up again, and
through It all Is untarnished herself. And yet If
she should go to the polls to vote against the crea
tion of that kind of man she would be forever dis
graced.
I hope that the time may never come when a
woman may enter upon the duties of mother,
child-rearer and home manager simply for those
functions alone.
Whatever else may result from this congress
this coming together cannot help maJclng us better
mothers, better women, better old maids.
Mrs. Cooper, being presented by Mrs.
Van Pelt, delivered the closing address
of the congress, taking for her subject
"The Practical Ethics of Home and Gov
ernment." She spoke in part as follows:
During the past wsek this congress has been de
voting itself to the great and comprehensive snb
jectof "Woman and Government." Those of you
who have II tened carefully to the papers pre
sented cannot fall to arirait that they have con
tained much of valuable suggestion along many
lines of practical thought and work. You have,
by your presence, your appreciation, your good
cheer and your helpful co-operation aided in
making the congress one of great profit and won
derful tuccess. . â¢ . .
It now remains for me, in closing this congress,
to offer a few thoughts on "Practical Kthics for the
Home and Gover mem." It seems to me that the
whole scope and drift of argument the past week
may be summed up In one brief sentence, which In
this: We must learn that nothing will preserve
society, but the living force of true and earnest
men and women, united in a common purpose to
advance the common weal. '
There can be no reformation or renovation In a
community unless the whole community are lifted
up to a higher level. The reformation Is to be
first or all, a personal matter. There Is to be a
reformation in the Individual, the household the
school, in commercial circles and in civil 'and
National government.
We must rise to the argument of American lib
i erty, and enter Into a conviction of the responsi
bilities and dignities and grandeur of the Amen
can ballot, as we have never yet done. We must
redeem the ballot by throwing about it a new life
anil sanctity. If we cannot do that, the less we
chatter and clatter about reformation the bette-
A woman's nature will never be changed; never
fear that. Men might spin, and churn, and knit,
ami sew, and cook, and rock the cradle for a hun
dred generations, and not be women. And
woman will not become man by external occupa
tions. God's colors do not wash out. Sex Is dyed
in the wool. The fact is, it Is the men that are
themselves nearest women, who are the very ones
most afraid that women will Jose their sex
It is a sort of latent rivalry. Power and versa
tllity will not change tbe social nor tho moral
qualities which men admire in women. Letting
nod take care of that nature of things which man
Is powerless to change, an that we need to asK Is
thai power may be given to virtue and that these
opportunities may be free by which power Is to be
secured.
This congress, now about to close, has done some
thing during the past week toward answering these
vital questions. It Is not a question of the new
man or the new woman. It is not a question 0/
( what we Intellectually think, but what wo mora iv
love find reverence and pursue, that will determine
: our <lestlny and the destiny of our great common
wealth. â  .
â¢ it ts n question of how to reach the people with
spiritual and physical health; how to make them
happier and better: how to Insure a purer govern
merit Of the people, by the, people and lor tlie
people. Good men and good women, banded to
gether for a common puipasc, with equal civil
and religious rights, can v. one solve this mighty
problem. - < <
With this highest Ideal In view, side by side arid
shoulder to- shoulder, the New Man and the New
Woman, Inspired to the highest things by a sub
lime estimate of existence, will walk steadily up
the slope with patient step, the eye fixed upon tin
goal of a new republic wherein dwc-llctU righteous

Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw addressed
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 10, 1896.
words of thanks to the congress lor the
courtesies extended to them.
Mesdames Van Pelt, Gaden, Swift. Krebs
and Sperry were appointed a committee
for the revising of the constitution, and
Miss Manning and Mesdames Swift, Bid
well, Barns and Miss Severance a commit
tee on resolutions.
It was announced that Miss Shaw would
preach in the hall at 7:45 o'clock this
evening on "Doubt as a Factor in Prog
ress."
The congress closed with the sineing of
the "Battle Hymn of the Republic," W. C.
Campbell leading and the vast assemblage
joining in the chorus.
During the last verse great enthusiasm
was manifest, hats, handkerchiefs and
bouquets waving all over the hall, while
Mrs. Van Pelt fetched an American flag
and drapea it over the shoulders of the
Rev. Miss Shaw and Miss Anthony.
And then amid a storm of cheering the
third annual meeting of the Woman's
Congress of the Pacific Coast adjourned.
GOOD NEWS FROM RUSSIA
A Nihilist Receives a Document
Telling Him of a Restored
Fortune.
In a Few Weeks He Will Inherit
the Vast Estate Belonging to
His Father.
Oakland Office ban Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, May 10. j
Dr. S. A. Ambrosewf, the Russian ex
iled nobleman, who is charged with being
a nihilist, received an important docu-
ment from Russia to-night. The news it
conveys will greatly disconcert several
officials in this city and San Francisco who
have, the doctor alleges, persecuted him
during the past year at tbe instance of
spies sent to this country from the Rus
sian court to follow and report upon his
movements.
He is living here in mortal fear of being
shot down by these Russian spies, who he
says are now and have been watching him
ever since be left home. Dr. Anibrosewf
at present conducts a free clinic at 857
Clay street, in this city, and resides on
Telegraph avenne. He has bever been be
fore the public to any extent till a year
ago, but has always stood ready to assist
the needy. Very little is known of his
hii-tory.
From what is known, however, he was
banished from his native land on the
ground that he was a nihilist. He received
word some time ago of bis father's death,
and at once appealed to the Russian Con
sul in San Fraucisco to assist him in secur
ing the estate, lie claims now that the
$SOO he paid that official was accepted, but
that no adequate service has ever been
rendered.
Dr. Ambrosewf says that the Russian
Consul has hindered rather than helped
him, and attributes thia to influences at
St. Petersburg.
When he discovered how things were
working Dr. Ambrosewf worked on his
own responsibility, and believes now that
he has affairs in such shape that he will
come into possession of the entire estate
before the (irst of June.
The letter received to-night bears an
official .â¢â eai and contained tidings that
made the doctor feel jubilant. "I have
been branded by the Consui in San Fran
cisco," said he, "as an impostor, but the
â  lay i n coming when he will have to take
his hat off to me. I am not in a
position to make any detailed state
ment as to the sensational events that
characterize my life, or in regard to tlie
vast family estate to which I am heir.
There are spies ready and willing to shoot
down an honest man for a couple of hun
dred dollars or even less, and by such I
have been watched and followed, but all
to no purpose. This letter I received
to-night brings good news, and before
the month is out I will be able to
receive and entertain you as a gentleman
shouM. My father died some time a^o,
and when I appealed to the Russian
Consul to assist me he wanted pay, so
I gave him $800, but he only worked
against me, and 1 snail attend to his case
alter a while."
About three months ago the doctor was
most mysteriously shot while going to a
patient late at night. He wp.s badly
though not seriously wounded in the
hand, and he attributes it to trie work of
spies. On that occasion he returned the
fire and his assailant disappeared, although
the doctor is certain he shot him in ti.e
thieh.
He declares that many petty troubles
have been created for him regarding his
diploma and properly. He is now c nn
dent that he has overcome the sinister in
fluence that is working against him at the
Czar's court and says that an interesting
experience is in store for the Russian
Consul.
SEARCHED FOR A LEAK.
Serious Explosion of Gas in a
Flat at 409 Post
Street.
A search with a lighted match for a
leak in the gas pipes in the lower flat 400
Post street resulted in an explosion last
night which caused the wildest excite
ment for a few minutes.
Charles Lenhart. manager for tbe Mon
arch card machines, was moving into the
flat, and was being assisted by three young
men â James Scully of S)Z Harriet street,
James Langstaff of G23 Harrison, and Gus
Deaver, Jes.-ie, near Seventh.
Tbe last load ha>l been taken to the
house about 9 o'clock, when Deaver
thought he smelled escaping gas in the
kitchen. Langstaff was standing in the
rear door, Lenhart at the door of the
kitchen and Scully was going toward the
front door for a looking-glass when Deaver
lit a match and turned on the gaÂ». There
was an explosion which was heard three
blocks away. Deaver was thrown against
Lenhart, and both fell on top of each
other ; Langstaff found himself on his back
in the yard, and Pcnlly was blown out of
the front door and landed on the street.
The front aoor was blown from its hinges
and torn in pieces.
Scully was picked np in an unconscious
condition and taken to Hughes' drug
store, on the corner of Powell and Post,
where for half an hour Warren Stilson,
the clerk, used oxygen gas on him to pro
duce artificial respiration. The ambulance
then arrived with Dr. Bunnell and Beully
was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where lie soon regained consciousness.
Ho complained of a pain in his back,
where he thought something had struck
him, and also of a pain in ids eyes.
Deaver was badiy burned abont the
hands ana enrs, and had them attended to
at Hughes' drugstore. Langstaff and Lefi
hart escaped with slight burns.
It was fortunate that bot'i the front and
rear doors were open, otherwise the bui d
inf would have been seriously damaged
and the four men severely if not fatally
injured.

POLLED THE FILES

Buckleyites Got Out a
Record of the Party
on Silver.
D AGGETT AS A SILVERITE
How the Present Federal Brigade
Once Lined Up for Free
Coinage.
BUCKLEY LITERARY BUREAU.
Piay'ng the Local Eemocratic Game
With the Silver Sentiment of
the Parly.
The Buckleyitesare conducting a shrewd
and vigorous campaign throughout the
Democracy of the State on the way of get
ting the Democratic leaders of every
county well informed in the merits of their
cause as representing the "regular" local
party, so that when the State Convention
meets their delegation may get recognition
either instead of the Junta's 181 or along
side of them.
Much missionary work is being done.
Correspondence i? going on, Democrats
from the interior are told about the local
muss at every opportunity and pulls are
being used through the State to set influ
ential people at work and thousands of
circulars and pamphlets are being mailed
to California Democrats everywhere.
One that |is just from the press is a
mighty interesting one to some people. It
is entitled "Record of the California De
mocracy on the Pree Coinage of Silver,"
ajid bears tiif nnines of Joseph Rothschild,
president, and I). lf< Unvigan, secretary, of
the General Committee.
The Buckleyites have learned by care
ful soundings "that the convention will be
a silver one by a big majority. The Buck
ley General Committee has adopted
riAiliot silver resolutions introduced Dy A.
J. Clunie at its last meeting and it will
play the silver business for all it is worth
in the contest with the Junta delegation
that will be for gold as far as Superinten
dent of the Mint Daggett and the rest of
the Federal brigade can make it so. Hence
this "record."
This eight-page pamphlet gives the plat
form planks on silver and gold, with some
of the pertinent discussions of them, of
every Democratic State Convention Â»ince
1852, showing tnat the record has a white
and not a yellow luster.
The document is quickly seen to be an
attack on the r'ederul brigade and the
Junta. Through its page.i ure given the
records as former silver me* of a lot of
these same Federal office-holders who are
now working hard to make an administra
tion and sound-money showing in the
State Convention.
The files are m^st effectively pulled on
John Daggett. ll is record as an ablo
champion of silver looms up strong and '
sure.
The record shows, for instance, that at
the State Convention of 1888 at Los An
geles the platform plank demanding "the
free coinage of both >:old and silver" was
adopted, tne plank being a verbatim copy
of the one in the preceding platform.
During the discussion of the platform it
was John Pa^^ett of Siskiyou, now the
administration s chief political representa
tive in California, wiio rose and in the
course of a brief speecii said :
The producer of gold had the privilege of
bringing his bullion to tho Mint and could
have it exchanged for the coin of the country.
It means that the product-rs of silver shall l>c
allowed an equal privilege. The tendency of
the present law is to depreciate the price <.f
silver, and as gold Is left ns the only remaining
standard of curroncy it must necessarily follow
that gold b.aomts appreciated. Such being
the fact, the man that produces wheat and
f ruit liaÃ to part with more of his produce in '
rder to obtain a dollar under the gold stan- j

THE WHITE HOUSE, which is the Great Dry Goods Establishment of San Francisco, situated at the northwest corner of Kearny and Post streets, is depicted in the
above illustration. The institution is a source of pride to the citizens of San Francisco and a natural aurprise to the owners of large establishments in the Eastern States,
who have not known that we can boast of such a great store. , ; '. . â:â : -'â 'â ,â  â¢
THE WHITE HOUSE is a complete establishment of the mont modern style, embodying every possible improvement. It is divided into Seventeen Distinct Depart-
ments, each with its own separate system, yet m.perfect harmony with each other. There is, in fact," a system and a decree of order in * the : entire institution that is some-
thing remarkable. - . v. , - : \
The same aim is noticeable in each departmentâ to sell the most goods at the lowest possible prices. These two vital principles of large sales, combined with small pro-
fits, have served to make THE WHITE HOUSE the most popular dry goods establishment in this city. r\
The readers of The Call and the patrons of THE WHITE HOUSE must bear one thought, particularly, in mind. An idea has existed that THE WHITE HOUSE
catered for but one class of tradeâ namely, the elite. -But this is not so.. All classes are welcome there and the same courteous attention and care is shown to all.
- - Every variety of Dry Goods is sold there. Dress Goods, Silks,' Ribbons, Laces, Gloves/Trimmings, Parasols, Ready-made. Ladies' Suits and Cloaks, ail have departments
of their own. Gentlemen's Furnishing Goods are also carried in great variety. A trip through the Art Department is as interesting as a visit to; a European Museum. . The
basement is also a world of itself. Visitors will find there tbe Mailing Department for Country Orders and General Shipping and also a Supply Department for each depart-
ment in the entire building. ' r ~ w rrv * *^
dar!. The only person benefited by the appre
ciation ot cold Is the bondholder, \vho is not a
producer, but who makes his living by the Cut
ting of coupons. Vow that thing no.s gone far
chough: that plank is eminently just and
proper, and I hope that It will bo adopted.
This piatform was indorsed by Campbell
P. Berry, now Assistant United States
Treasurer; W. D. English, now Surveyor
of the Port; M. F. Tarpey and the rest of
them.
Daggett, as vice-chairman of the State
Central Committee, called to order the
convention of 1890 at San Jose, when an
other free coinage plank was adopted.
The Democratic State Convention met
at Fresno May 17, IBM, and adopted the
following plank in the platform :
"Section 6. That we denounce the acts
of the Republican party slgainst silver,
particularly the act demonetizing it. and
we believe that there should be kept in
constant circulation a full and suflicient
volume of money consisting of gold, silver
and iegaL-tender paper curiency at par
with each other."
Among the delegates to the conven
tion and those who voted for the platform
containing the silver plank were: John
H. Wise, Collector of Customs: O. M.
Welburn, Collector of Internal Revenue;
William D. Ensrlish, Surveyor; John P.
Irish, Naval Officer; Robert Barnett,
United States Mint; Barry Baldwin,
United States Marshal; Max Popper, Gov
ernment contractor; AY. H. Kelly, United
States Mint; James H. Wilkins, Prison
Director: Waverly Stairly, Internal Rev
enue Collector, and others, now for gold,
but formerly for silver.
Regarding the convention of 1894 in San
Francisco the record says:
The Federal office-holders in the State were
all participants in shaping the course and
platform of that convention containing the
above free silver coinage plank, and are tho
same men who Rre actively supporting the
'â¢Junta" Democratic committee of Sau Fran
cisco to-day and loudly demanding a gold
delegation be sent to Sacramento in order to
control in the Interest of the single gold stan
dard the delegation to the National Conven
tion, and at one fell swood reverse all Cali
fornia Democracy has done and said in the
interest of free coinage of silver since the de
monetization <v f,il\er iv 1873. Federal officers
in >-an Francisco have given tlieir instructions,
and all subordinates and employes know tnat
they will lose their places ii they do not sup
port the "Junta" and send IGI gold delegates
to Sacramento.
The position on free silver coinage atad other
matters of the regular General Committee of
the Democratic party of the Cily and County
! of San Francisco, who will send lUI delegat s
i to the Sacramento convention on June 1(3,
I 189(5, will be best undt-rstood and explained
by the pt- rusal of the following resolutions and
pledge, formally adopted on April IU, IÂ»D6, at
a_reguiar meeting of that body, composed of
j 4">O members of the representative Democratic
iiarty workers in this City :
W. D. English and John Dageett were
respectively chairman and vice-chuirman
of the State Central Committee which
conducted the campaign of 18S6 in a plat
form declaring for free coinage. So on
goes the story from the flies and old scrap
books of how the leading members of the
present Federal brigade were out for silver
in times when no patronage appointments
had corrected their judgments on the
financial question.
There ure other things in the Record.
It cites State Convention precedents which
bid the Junta delegation stay off the tem
porary roll until the contest is settled by
the convention.
The State will be flooded with other cir
culars giving the history of the local split
and giving the Buckley committee the
ciear right of it, and when convention
delegates begin to be elected they will be
assiduously looked after.
Of course Christopher A. Buckley ao
proves all these moves, and his advice is
I kept busy ai the Kith of June seems draw-
I ing near arid the band is getting ready to
play.
There was a bie council of war at the
Occidental Club last night, attended by
Chris Buckley and all the heavy-weights of
the iiuekley forces. One campaign feature
that was discussed was the naming of
convention delegates, nominations for

The Junta has a plan to win prestige by
sending up a lot cf big nice men, or at
least their names. The Buckleyites are
gome to play tnat game too. The roll of

consideration, too, if it does not inspire

HIS FATAL MISTAKE.
G. B. liarktn, an Old Man, Swallows
Laudanum Thinking It Was Cough .
Medicine.
G. B. Larkin, an old man living at 1124
Howard street, made a fatal mistake yes
! terday morning by swallowing a dose of
j laudanum instead of cough mixture.
He got up at 6 o'clock yesterday morn
ing and after milking his two cows he sat
down to read the morning paper till his
wife cooiced his breakfast. A severe lit of
coughing came on and he reached up to
the corner of the niantelpiece and took
what he thought was his bottle o' cough
mixture. He took the laudanum bottle
instead and swallowed about an ounce and
j a half. He commenced rending again, but
j soou fell asleep. His wife could not rouse
him up and becoming alarmed at seeing
I his face turning black she notified the
I Receiving Hospital and ne was taken tnere
I in the am bui an cc.
Dr. Rinne, who accompanied the am
bulance, pave him an antidote, and Dr.
Weil gave him another an hour or so later.
Everything was done to save his life, but
the poison had got too firm a hold upon
his system and he died about 4 o'clock
yesterday afternoon. His body was taken
to the Morgue.
TO BE HEARD AGAIN,
J. Howard Smith's Suit Sub
mitted to the Supreme
Court.
The Judges Are Evenly Divided, and
They Want to Hear More
Argument.
The suit of J. Howard Smith against the
Ferries and Cliff House line, which has been
pending on appeal before the Superior
Court, has Deen ordered resubmitted by
the Justices.
The order was made because the court is
evenly divided on the question, and the
Justices want to hear more argument.
Justice Garoutie, however, dissents. He
thinks the judgment of the lower court
should stand us it always does when tne
Supreme Court cannot come to a decision.
The order explains the cause of the dead-
Jock. It is as follows:
In this cause, Justice Harrison being dis
qualified and the others being equally divided
in opiniou as to whether the judgment should
be reaffirmed or reversed, and further argu
ment beinsjt desired by some of the Justices, it
is ordered that the submission of this case be
and the sajne hereby Is set aside, and that it
be placed upon the caleudar for further oral
argument.
Justice Garoutte dissented from this
order in the following words:
I dissent from the order submitting this case
for further argument. It has been pending in
this court for a long time and already has been
exhaustively argued. Printed briet-i ably pre
senting every question raised by this appeal
are now on tile, and no good purpose ca>j be
subserved by a rerabmlsslon. If the court be
equal y divided in opinion the judgment
should be affirmed on well-settled principles.
The suit brought by Smith is to have de
clared invalid a bond issue for $4,-00,000,
to compel an accounting from the directors
of the road and to huve it decreed that the
action of the directors in transferring to
themselves 24,750 shares of unsubscribed
stoclc was illegal. The action was brought
to prevent the ferries and Cliff House line
and its branches from joining the street
railway combine. It was commenced be
fore Judge Siack, and he sustained the de
fendants' demurrer to tlie complaint.
From that decision an appeal was taken.

NEWS OF THE CHURCHES,
Miss Sarah Pratt Carr Is Or
dained to the Unitarian
Ministry.
A PROMINENT SUFFRAGIST.
The Princess of Bulgaria to Be the
Recipient of Pope Leo's
Gold n Rose.
Mrs. Sarah Pratt Carrof Lemoore, a lady
who was very prominent during the
Woman's Congress held last year in
this City, is now entitled to prefix the title
of Reverend to her name. This distinc
tion was conferred tÂ»y the solemn act of
ordination of the ITntarian Conference.
For some time past Mrs. Sarah Pratt Carr
has been very prominent in missionary
work at Lemoore and her labors have
resulted in the formation of The Unita
rian Society of Lemoore.
The church which Mrs. Carr has been
instrumental in organizing at Lemoore
and of which she will be pastor is to take
&i its motto, Deed<j rather than creeds.
Its objects will be, the preamble states, to
look after the interests of religion and
morality and to assist others in bearing
the burden of life. Mrs. Carr is associated
in lier work with Rev. Mr. Schultz, and
these two ministers have begun to extend
the sphere of their operations to Visalia
so successfully that plans are already
formulated for the organization of a
permanent Unitarian society.
The Unitarians of Redlands have de
cided to buy a lot and built a church, and
when Unitarians in Southern California
fully decide to do anything it is as well as
done.
Ever since the members of the First
Christian Church on Twelfth street re
ceived the resignation of Rev. Robert
Campbell they have been looking about
for a well-known preacher to step into his
shoes, but have not yet decided on one.
This morning the pulpit will be tilled by
Rev. Edward Davis of Oakland, known as
tbe actor-preacher on account of his
dramatic style of preaching, which has
caused many admirers of the drama to de
clare that he is a loss to tbe stage.
Dr. John Watson of Queen's College,
Queenstown, Canada, is now in Berkeley,
having come by invitation of the Philo
sophical Union of the State University to
deliver a serie3 of philosophical lectures.
Pope Leo is said to have selected the
Princess of Bulgaria as the recipient of the
Golden Rose for this year, in token of bis
approval at her opposition to making little
Prince Boris a member of the orthodox
faith.
The First Hebrew Congregation of Oak
land has obtained the desired legal author
ity to sell its present synagogue and pur
chase the new site.
Â±lev. A. B. Elzas, formerly of Sacra
mentto, but now of Charleston, has been
re-elected for three years. His congrega
tion, wliicu wus the first to use a Reform
ritual in America, has adopted the new
Union Prayer-book.
The members of the First Congrega
tional Church are to some extent like
sheep witnout a fold, though the officers
of Plymouth Congregational Church on
Po3t street have extended them a general
invitation to worship among the members
of Dr. Williams' flock. There is a rumor
that Catholic capitalists intend to buy the
First Church and present it to Archbishop
Riordan for a Catholic mission.
DR. GERRIGUES CONVICTED.
i rrtcc to Enforce the Reg-
istration of Births.
Dr. L. F. Guerrigues, the physician for
whose arrest a warrant was sworn out by
the ilealtn Department on a charge of
having violated the law by neglecting to
register births coming within his practice,
appeared in Judge Low's court for trial
yesterday and pleaded guilty. On the
advice of the Health Department Judge
Low assessed a fine of $5, merely as a warn
ing to other physicians, against whom the
Health Oftice has evidence, that the law
will be enforced.
Unless the case has the desired effect a
number of arrests will be made in the near
future.

PRISON-MADE JUTE BAGS
Only a Few Thousand Borax
Sacks to Be Made at
San Quentin.
COMPETING WITH FREE LABOR.
State Prison Directors In a Quandary
About Providing for Insane
Prisoners.
At the regular meeting of the State Board
of Prison Directors at San Quentin yester
day there was present R. M. Fitzgerald,
D. E. Hayes, James H. Wilkins and E. J.
Depue, J. H. Neff absent. The principal
subject considered was cue manufacture of
jute bags.
Warden Hale in his report stated that
the sale of jute bags for the season was
000,000. Of these 200,000 were sugar bags,
â which sold for h\C cents. Jute on hand
and to be delivered at the mill in a short
time amounts to 5813 bales. This will last
at the present rate of consumption until
about December 1.
The matter of selling 10,000 borax bags
to the Paciiic Borax Company brought up
the subject of the protest of the Oakland
Cotton Mills against competing with con
vict labor. Director Fitzgerald stated that
he had discussed the matter with Mr. Ruth
erford of the Oakland company betore
the contract was let, but he did not make
much objection to the Slate turning out
the work.
It was not until after the Warden had
made the contract with the borax firm
that the employes of the cotton mills
entered their protest against what they
considered unfair competition. Ttien v
was that Mr. Fitzgerald called the atten
tion of Mr. Rutherford to the fact that the
State has worked up a little trade in the
sale of sugar bags to the Ghino refinery
and with the Sandwich Islands. He wanted
to know of Mr. Rutherford if a protest
would be made if the State turns its atten
tion to this class of product. Mr. Ruther
ford told him that there would not.
Director Hayes said that after the board
works up a trade in these lines it cannot
afford to entertain any more protests in
that direction. It was the sentiment of
the directors that while not desiring to
enter into competition with free labor
there are several kinds of jute bags that
the free mills are not prepared to handle.
It was decided to fill the order for 10,000
borax bags, but not to make any more.
Warden Hale asked" for permission to
tear down the old brick laundry and erect
another structure for the confinement of
weak-minded and insane prisoners. The
present "cranky alley" is not a fit
place for this class of prisoners. The
bricks could be saved and be used in a
new building.
This raised another annoying subject.
There is no fund upou which to draw to
erect a suitable building for the criminal
insane, and there is too much risk in send
ing ttieni to the asylums.
Lirector Wilkins suggested that thesub
ject be taken up at the next meeting at
Folsom. It might be advisable to bniid a
ward for the insane at that prison. The
quarries there would furnish all the mate
rial necessary for :i substantial structure,
and all insane convicts could be kept at
Folsom. The subject was laid over until
the next meeting at Foisom. The Warden
was authorized to tear down the old laun
dry.
Toe reports of about two dozen parole
convicts now scattered all over the State
were read, showing that the system is
working successfully, and that the men

Conrad Praetzel was appointed as parole
clerk to take charge of this department at
a salary of $75 per month.
Several convicts appeared before the
board. Adam Stroh was charged with
baring opium in his possession. He said
that he has been using opium since Decem
ber. It was given to him by a friend, but
he refused to divulge the name of his
friend, nor could any information be ob
tained as to how the drug was taken into
the prison.
The u'uard testified that in Stroh's cell
were about two pounds of the drue. The
board decided that Stroh should forfeit all
his credits and wear a ball and chain for
thirty days.
William LaÃrie asked for a restoration
of twenty-seven months' credits, forfeited
for stealing $5 from the captain of the
prison steamer Caroline. The case was
continued indefinitely, as LaÃrie has still
a long term to serve.
Upon the recommendation of the War
den eight months' credits were restored to
John McNamee, accused of fighting. This
will let the young fellow leave the prison
on August 2.
SWEET HOUR OF ART.
Directors Bosqni and Stafford of the Art
Association Cannot Agree.
The new directory of the San Francisco
Art Association is not the happiest official
family in town. There are several points
upon which the board cannot agree, and
one which seems trivial at first glance
becomes more important as the subject is
observed. This ooint relates to the hour
of board meetings. It is claimed that Di
rector Bosqui, who has given a guiding
hand to the Art Association for more than
twenty years, prefers to meet his felJow
directors for the transaction of official
business during some hour of daylight.
On the other hand, "William G*. Stafford,
the new secretary of the association, pre
fers that -the directors should convene at
some hour between twilight and dawn.
The noon hour is very convenient to Mr.
Boqui. who dwells in Marin County after
darK, and prefers to pass his evenings at
home. Mr. Bosqui's ideas of happiness
consist in giving his days to art and his
nights to sleep.
The commercial environment which
beages the artistic genius of Mr. Stafford
relates to daily transactions in Beaver Hill
coal. Mr. Stafford would give both his
days and nights to art were he a million
aire, but the hard features of selling a long
ton of coal for a figure below the cost of a
picture-frame keeps him in the ranks of
the toilers.
While he cannot give lavishly in money
to promote art he can lend his moral sup
port and give some of his time, but he
cannot conscientiously give that time in
the daylight, when he ought to be watch
ing the coal market and keeping an eye on
Alex Dunsmuir, Arthur Ebbetts, P. B.
Cornwall and other dealers in hard ana
soft coal.
Now, it occurred to Mr. Martin of the
j Art Association a few days ago that lie
could reconcile the differences in the board
by having lunch at the institute on the
days the board met. He fancied that this
would allure ali the members of the board,
and the proposed spread at the Art Insti
tute on the hill unfolded another and a
broader proposition.
There he wouid be compelled to eat his
victuals, talk of art and think of coal, all
at the same time. The idea did not par
ticularly catch the fancy of Secretary
Stafford. The secretary was Dot so easily
won over. At his usual place of luncheon,
the Bohemian Ciub, he knows that he can
eat his food and yet keep his mind on
coal, but the task was too great and he de
clined the round table at the institute.
The vexed question is further than ever
from settlement. Bosqui Holds out for
daylight sessions, and Stafford insists that
the evening hours should be sacred to art.

Both William F. Herrin, chief counse

had been stricken from the list of the

the former and would hereafter pimply be
employed as occasion demanded, that feel

the gentlemen named, and making other
assertions not calculated to please either
Mr. Herrin or General Barnes nor to
strengthen the friendly relations between
them.
So strongly uas the article in question
jarred the peace of mind of the Republi

correspondent of the Democratic paper,
which now seeks to create estrangement
between him and the chief counsel of the

read with some personal interest the article on
page 9of the Examiner of this day, entitled
"General Barnes Loses His Salary-" I cannot
imagine the source from which the statements
made in the article emanated. It is enough to
gay that it is wholly without foundation in
fact so far as it relates to mÂ«.
The article states that I refused to discuss
the matter or the reasons for the change. I
have to say that I have never been spoken to
on the subject by any person.
It also states: "Herrni and Barnes are not
the best of friends, and their dislike of each
other goes back to the days of the Sharon di
vorce case." 1 desire to say that, on the con
trary, Mr. Herrin and myself ure the best of
friends, and our friendship is founded upon
mutual respect and esteem. Mr. Herrin bus
never done tÂ»n unfriendly act to me, and, on
the contrary, has shown his kindly feelings in
many ways and at all times, and I should be
glad of an opportunity to render like service
to him. Mr. Herrin has never gone out of his
way to attack my legal ability ; on the contrary,
he has procured my employment in important
I was not displeased when Mr. Herrin De
came the chief counsel of the Southern Pa
cific Company. I was glad of it. I never
goughtthe position and, so far as I know, I
wu never suggested as a possible candidate
;or it It did not nettle me to have Mr. Herrtn
put over me. I never had any assurance
from the Crockers that my relation to the
company would not be disturbed. Colonel
Croc Ker and myself never spoke on the subject.
If Mr Herrin's attitude toward me has the
approval of the Uuntingtons I am pleased.
My acquaintance with Mr. C. P. Huntington Is
very slight: indeed, I never met him socially
until his last visit to San Francisco. I am,
however, acquainted with Mr. H. K. Hunting
ton and like him very much, and our relations ]
have always been most pleasant, and I know j
no reason why they should not continue as 1
they arc. \ours truly, W. H. L. Barnes.
Not less outspoken than General Barnes j
is Mr. Herrin, who when interviewed yes
terday on the matter expressed his indig
nation as follows:
"The article in the Examiner this morn
ing appears to be a fabrication from be
ginning to end. There has been no change
whatever in the terms of en.p'.oyment of
General Barnes by the company. On the
contrary, his employment stands just as
it did when I became chief counsel of the
company.
"The statement, therefore, that some
warm conversation had occurred between
General Barnes and myself on the subject
is entirely untrue, as there has been no
change and, in fact, no thought of
change.
'It is also stated that I declined to dis
cuss the reasons for this change. This.
too, is entirely untrue, as the matter was
never mentioned to me. Tne first intima
tion I had of it was when my attention
wae called to the article as publish! d.
"The statement that 'Herrin and Barnes
are not the beat of friends' is also made
out of whole cloth. We have never had
any difficulty or unpleasantness, and our
relations throughout the Sharon divorce
case were entirely pleasant and friendly
and in the last proceedings had in this
litigation General Barnes and I acted
together as sole attorneys for the Sharon
estate."
On being shown General Barnes' letter
and after perusing it he said in emphatic
tones, "I indorse everything said by Gen
eral Barnes."

FOR A LITTLE INCURABLE
Ladies' Orchestra to Establish a >
Bed in the Children's
Hospital.
TO BE MAINTAINED BY THEM.
Mrs. Wright, the President. Speaks of
the Orchestra's Charitable
Labors.
. There will be another bed established in.
the incurable annex of the Children's
Hospital. At least, several charitably in
clined young ladies of the City have ex
pressed their determination that such
shall be the case. -
These young ladies comprise the Satur
day Morning Orchestra, which has been in
existence for some five years. During that
time it has given many concerts-very suc
cessful ones-and the proceeds have invari
ably been handed over to prominent charit
able bodies.

-J!!â¢' S ' Â« Wri ht . the president, Is very
enthusiastic on the subject. She says the
rest of the members are as delighted with
the project as she.
"Of course," she said, "we expect that
we are undertaking something that en
tails great responsibility, but this is not
M T e j nt . end to do we want to maintain
the bed right along.
"I do hope that it will be a success. The
youneer members of the orchestra espe
clal[y ar very confident and hopeful.
t Mr. Roncovieri has been conscientious
m his instruction, and I believe that we
have an orchestra that for execution can
be compared favorably with any amateur
orchestra in the country.
"When we look about us at the wee
mites to idling about the street with little
or no supervision, and reflect that the lives
they lead are likely to place them in need
of sKillrul nursing and good wholesome
food at any time, we all ought to quit
theorizing about how to manage to relieve
them, and get down to good, practical,
earnest work in their behalf.
"The Saturday Morning Orchestra has
merely joined the procession in behalf of
the children. And so we propose to estab
lish a bed in the Children's Hospital.
"The method we have chosen is to give
a concert at Golden Gate Hall on the even
ing of the 28th inst. This will be followed
by others at opportune times and the pro
ceeds in every case will go for the main
tenance of the bed.
"There will be some special features at
the concert, such as song by Mrs. O. P.
Evans, violin solos by Miss Crabtree and
Miss Gruenhagen, a duet with cornet and
trombone by the Misses Noble, and many
other pleasing items. We have worked
hard and deserve success."

PREDICT SUCCESS,
W. E. Arthur and J. C.
Lynch on the Political
Outlook.
LEADERS ARE CONFIDENT
Convention Chairman and Future
Lieutenant â¢ Governor
Concur.
IT WILL BE A WALKOVER.
Tribute to Mr. Spreckels for His
Workâ Democrats Will Try to
Get the Legislature.
J. C. Lynch of San Bernardino County,
who has been nominated by the Republi
cans of California for Lieutenant-Gov
ernor, will leave for his home to-day. Mr.
Lynch is very confident of the success of
the Republican principles in this State
and over the Nation.
He is well satisfied with the work of the
State Convention, and believes that wis
dom has been displayed as manifested in
its platform. He does not doubt that the
ticket this fall will be successful.
Mr. Lynch, who is a native of Ohio, and
who spent some time in Chicago before
coming here, has been in California fifteen
years. It is not g nerally known, but is a
fact, that he is the son of the famous Gen
eral John Lynch, of Louisiana, president
ol the Lynch Returning Board. Mr.
Lynch Sr. was a State Senator in Louisi
ana, also chairman of the State Central
Committee for a good many years, and
was also burveyor-Ueneral. lie was dur
ing those years a close political friend of
Governor NVeymouth and other voted Re
publicans.
Mr. Lynch, who has been nominated for
Lieutenant-Governor, has had a steady
ri^e. Only a little while ago he was
elected a member of the Legislature. Then
he was mentioned for Speaker, was
elected, made a record, and a few days ago
at Sacramento was nominated by the Re
publicans for the highest office but one
under the State Government.
Mr. Lynch pays a high tribute to Mr.
Spreckels for his disinterestedness in try
ing to give the people of this City and
State a good government. In a general
way la9t niihtMr. Lynch said:
â¢â¢lam satisfied that the feeling in Cali
fornia in favor of Republicanism is over
whelming. I am certain, too, that the
last three years have been an object lesson
to the people in favor of protection
stronger than any argument that could be
made.
"I think, too, that the Populist craze is
dying out. In Southern California the
Populists have ceased to cut any particu
lar figure.
"I am sure, too, from what I have ob
served, that a large portion of the usually
Democratic vote will this year be solid for
the Republican party. And in my judg
ment the Republican majority in Cali
fornia will be a surprise to the most san
guine Republicans.
"In niany of tne Southern counties the
Democratic party has almost lost its or
ganization, and is making but feeble
efforts.
"The real efforts of tbe Democrats will
he finally toward getting a majority of the
Legislators. Tney are going to make an
effort to capture the next United States
Senator. And tney are making this effort
with some degree of confidence. This I
know. They nope to win votes on little
side issues, and to catch votes from those
who may feel disaffected.
"I think the Republican party as a whole
understands and appreciates fully the dis
interestedness of Mr. Spreckels. He is the
recognized leader, and is a gentleman who
is doing a good deal for the State. As to
National politics, there is no question but
the man who is nominated at St. Louis
will be triumphantly elected. We have

had enough of Democracy as it has been I
dealt out to us for the last three or four
years. We want protection to our inter
ests and a Government that will bring
back the old prosperity always found
| under a Republican administration."
W. E. Arthur, chairman of the recent
Republican State Convention at Sacra
mento, who is at the Palace, yesterday ex
pressed his satisfaction at the work of the
convention and confidence ad to the ulti
mate victory of the party.
"I have seen some criticisms," he said,
| "that portrayed the convention as ap
pathetic, and the men comprising it as
lacking interest. There could have been
Ino statement farther from the truth. I
believe that a man, or an aggregation of
men, may have so deep an interest in a
thing, that words may seem useless.
"Men may be so severely in earnest that
they may seem absolutely indifferent.
But I can assure any, who have believed
otherwise, that the delegates to the State
Convention were not cold; they \*ere dead
in earnest.
"It was a convention of men who had
positive convictions. They knew what
they wanted, and were going to have it.
There was no need of any flapdoodle
I speeches, or any attempt to pull feathers
out of the eagle's tail.
"One of the most notable things was the
unanimity with which the report of the
committee on credentials was accepted.
It showed that there was the strongest
| confidence in the men comprising the
committee.
â¢'These were men in fact among the
ablest in the State. They had been chosen
I with care. They executed their trust well
and had the confidence of their co-workers
in Republicanism.
"Another thing the convention did and
that was that it emphasised its repudia
tion of the appointment of delegates by

committees.
"What of the outlook for a victory?"
"It will be a walkover."
"In Pasadena, my town, at least ten per
cent of the prominent Democrats â there
are not very many of them â have long
since announced that they will support
the Republican ticket.
"Besides this, all over Southern Califor
nia the Democratic defection is great.
"It is above and beyond all question that
California is Republican, and I think al!
Republicans see and understand that they
must lake their National policy from the
National platform. There is no doubt
about that. We may desire certain things
locally, bat when the National Conven
tion has voiced the belief of the great
party which has now so many victories,
by its platforms, that platiorm will guide
all true Republicans.
FACED THE HUSBAND.
Bastian, Who Ruined Mri. Kline's Life,
Tells His Story to tbe
Coroner.
The peculiar spectacle of the destroyer
of a once happy home announcing in tbe
present I ** of the man whose happiness he
had wrecked that his evil influence had
brought about the family disruption was
i witnessed at the Coroner's office yesterday
during the inquest on the body of Mrs.
Mac Kline, who committed suicide on
May 3, at 518 Geary street, by sending a
bullet through her brain.
Thomas C. Holden, tbe divorced hus
band of the suicide, was placed on the
stand. In a plain, blunt way he told how
one A. C. Bastian had enticed his wife,
and later caused her to leave him. "The
deceased was taken ill some two years ago,
and, thinking she was dying, had con
fessed all to him." Holden then stated
that he had given nis wife a regular
monthly allowance from the day of the
separation to the time of her death.
During the recital of this story Bastian
brought down the wrath of the Coroner on
his head by laughing outright. "Do you
think it Is funny to hear this witness tell
ing of his sorrows?" Said Coroner Haw
kins. "We will put you in jail and col
you off." After that the young fellow was
as quiet as a church mouse.
Bastian was then placed on the witness
stand. He endeavored to throw the whole
blame of Mrs. Kline's affection for him
and his for her on the husband. He said
Holden bad often \ent him with his wife
to places of amusement and one time in
sisted on his accompanying her to Peta
luma. ".".-V,
The jury, after a few moments' delibera
tion, returned the following verdict:
We, the jurors of the inquest of Mrs. Mac
Kline, find that she came to her death by her
own hands through despondency caused by
unrequited love and by a letter received from
one Fred Bastian and the jury censures him
for his actions.

A TRAGEDY AVERTED.
A. A. M-iiirc Wanted to Mete Out Snm-
Mary Justice to â¢ a News
paper Man. -
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 9. f
A. A. Moore was hunting for a newspa
per man this afternoon and but for the in
tervention of Judge Nusbaumer there
might have been trouble.
Mr. Moore sets a high value on his repu
tation and when he read in a paper this
morning that he had settled a case in court
with Juiig- 1 Frieic and that the Judge's
Congressional ambition and the Southern
Pacific Railroad controlled by
The Hall and Clubhouse at Uaywards Where the Grand Council of the Y. At. I. Will Meet a Week
From To- Morrow.
Mr. Moore had more to do with the case
than justice he was angry.
This statement displeased the gentlemen
greatly and they started out to tind the
I cau^e of it. V> v hile talking to Judge Nus
! baumer the editor of the paper passed, but
\va* unknown to Mr. Moore.
"Tnere goes your man," said Nus
baumer.
"Well, I'm not going to defend myself
in the courts," sai i A. A. Moore, "I'll do
it with less trouble," and Mr. Moore
I started off on the run.
Judge Nushaumer suggested arbitration
I and pulled Mr. Moore's sleeve, and after
! a homily succeeded in getting Mr. Moore
; into his ollice. Then the wicked editor
j was sent for and an explanation followed
and what promised to be a tragedy was
' averted.

MANY ORDERS TO BE IN LIKE
Every Promise Made at Vallejo Will
Be Kept With One Ex
ception.
HAYWARDS, Cal., May 9.â One week
from next Monday the Grand Coun
cil of the Young Men's Institute will
convene at Uaywards. During the past
week numerous communications have
been received of the various committees
asking for information regarding the
town, it; accommodations and its attrac
tions.
Haywards is one of the prettiest towns
in Alaraeda County, and deserves all that
was said about it at Vallejo last year by
the delegates who succeeded in capturing
the Grand Council of this year.
Only one thing is lacking that was
promised, and that is the fruit. This,
however, is not the fault of the Haywards'
folk, for the Grand Council is usually held
in August, and the early date of this year
is the result of the National Council held
at Denver two months ago.
Haywards is setting an example regard
ing the parade that is worthy of being fol
lowed in every town in the State. The
whole town has made it their opportunity
to show what Haywards can do and all
are working to make it one big success.
All the business houses will decorate and
for the day of the great parade the town
will be eiven over to festivity. Several of
the local secret societies will take part in
the parade, including the Native Sons,
Woodmen, Foresters and the Portuguese
Union. The Fire Department will make
a particularly fine showing.
The Hay wards Council will be headed
by a drum corps which has just been or
ganized, consisting of Manuel RoEers,
Ralph Jessup, Ernst Bridge, Frank Mar
shall, Manuel Rigg. Johnnie Paun and
others.
All the residents have mutually agreed
that the town shall present as neat an ap
pearance as possible and every stray weed
and truant grass tuft is being removed
and pgint its being lavishly used.
The committee on parade has completed
its programme for tue grand parade. It

JORDAN'S TASK.
The County Clerk'a Office Making Prog
ress Struggling With the Great
Kegister.
OA KLAND, Cal., May 9.â County Clerk
Jordan and his staff <are hard at work on
the stupendous task of writing 44,000
names on the great and precinct registers,
with all the facts set forth in the affidavits
as to personal descriptions, nativity, resi
dence, educational qualification, etc., to
be each carefully examined, located in
proper precincts, numbered and tiled al
phabetically and names to be addressed on
envelopes for sample ballots, the neces
sary comparisons, checking and arrange
ment for the printers, with the addressing
and mailing of 22,000 postal cardsâ all this
in adildition to the rapidly increasing
worn of the office in connection with the
courts and Board ot Supervisors.
Mr. Jordan was the first County Clerk
in the State to undertake this work, and
was, at first, subjected to some criticism
from clerks in other counties, but the lat
ter, who are now beginning the work they
hoped they would not be required to do,
are writing to him for points and general
information. The increased work thrown
upon his office by the new mode of regis
tration has compelled the employment at
his own expense of a considerable number
of additional clerks.
Still Erecting Poleg.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 9 - Delanoy is
meeting with no resistance from the
powers tnat be and is going ahead witn
his work. He says he will have 500 more
posts here next week and has now twenty
five men employed. Speaking of tlie
opposition be expected to encounter Mr.
Delanoy remarked that "'the Trustees are
the worst kuocked-out lot of men in Ala
meda and remind me of spanked babies
tied up to a bedpost." They so far have
have not squalled, and it is conjectured
will do nothing until the injunction suit
is settled.
PEARSON AS A MASCOT,
He Unseated His Arch-Enemy
Wilson at the Recent
Convention.
OLD TROUBLES ARE REVIVED.
The Orator Says the Success of the
Primary Men Was Doe to
His Color.
Oakland Offick San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 9. )"
Thomas Pearson, the colored orator,
says he is tlfe mascot of the colored wing
of the Republican party in the county.
There is likely to be further trouble over
the unseating of the appointed delegates at
Sacramento and the seating of those
electee! at primaries in this county.
The interest is now centered in the col
ored voters of the Republican party, and
has revived the old feud between the two
winps of the Afro-American four hundred
in this city.
It all comes from the fact that J. B.
Wilson wa^forced to vacate bis seat in
favor of Thomas Pearson. J. B. Wilson is
the editor of an organ of the race pub
lished in San Francisco, and a few months
ago he printed some remarks that led to a
case of libel in the Police Court. The
whole of the colony in Oakland was inter
ested in the event, and although the Judge
found the editor guilty at the first trial a
jury acquitted him on the second.
The many bitter things* said and done in
the court widened the breach, and when
politics became active the two leaders each
appeared at the head of their respective
parties and demanded ;ecofruition. Their
demands were granted. J. B. Wilson,
who lives in the Fiftieth Assembly Dis
trict, was one of the delegates appointed
to the Sacramento convention. He was
especially jubilant over the fact that the
State Central Committee recognized the
appointed delegates, and laughed long and
loudly at his confrere's plipht.
Thomas Pearson was the colored dele
gate elected for the Forty-eighth Assem
bly District, and is a stanch supporter of
primaries. He went to Sacramento feel
ing rather blue, but he jumped six feet in
the air when he heard the report of the
committee on credentials. The appointed
delegates were in the seats set apart for
Alameda County, and tliey were loth to
vacate them.
Mr. Pearson sent a messenger to J. B.
Wilson to tell him that the primary men
wanted his seat. Mr. Wilson was highly
displeased and Mr. Pearson waa radiant
with jubilation,
Since that time Mr. Pearson tans been
telling of the incident all over town, and
Mr. Wilson is anxious to stop him. but bo
far has not succeeded.
"Very funny thing," said Mr. Pearson
to-night. "It was a cola day in Sacra
mento, and I was tickled to see my old
friend in my seat. He had just warmed
it nicely for n;e. I sat down with great,
pleasure. I tell you I'm the wisest of the
colored Republicans of Alameda County.
I always come up smiling, and the best
thine the primary men ever did was to
put me on their ticket."
CLASS DAY EXERCISES.
Students of the State University
Observe Their Annual Day
of Festival.
Closirg of ihe Flower Show â Award
Listâ U. C Glee Club Give Their
Last Concert This Year.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 9.â To-day was
class day at the State University and the
occasion was elaborately celebrated.
The members of the graduating class ap
peared in costume, the ladies wearing
wtiite from heaa to foot and the gentle
men sporting black plug hats and whit 3
duck trousers.
The sophomores of the year just passed
wore their new junior plugs, adorned with
various selections from the college yell
and the '98 class yell, together with "skull
and cross bones," in honor of the Bourdon
"rush" victory of the class of '98. All day
the new juniors gathered in groups and
held bat-smashing rushes, and by night
there were but few of the new plugs left
without many marks of hard usage.
The new sophomores, freshmen until to
day, wore mortar-boards and practiced
singing the song they have hitherto de
spised, "The Jolly Sophomore."
The exercises in commemoration of the
day began at 10:30 o'clock this morning
at "Founders' Rock." A slab of Tennes
see marble has been placed in the rock by
the class of '96, and on it, engraved in gold
letters, are the words, "'Founders' Rock,
May 16, 1860. Inscribed May 9, 1896."
The rock is one on which the trustees of
the old College of California met when
they dedicated the grounds cUosen as a site
for the State University.
The senior class, led by the university
band and followed by many visitors,
gathered around the rock and listened to
addresses by Galen M. Fisher '96, Dr. E.
S. Willey of San Francisco and President
Kellogg.
After the exercises at Founders' Rock
the class pilgrimage took place under the
leadership of the U. C. band. Raymond J.
Rub? made a brief address at the Chemistry
building. Benjamin H. Ramsdell spoke
the farewell to the Library building for the
class, and at North Hall a speech was
made by Arthur W. North.
Over 6000 people gathered in the natural
amphitheater behind the Chemistry build
in*, known as "Ben Weed's Amphi
theater."
The exercises opened with an address of
greeting by A. C. Wyckoff, president of
the class of '96, after which Joan L. Whit
tenmeyer read the class history.
The class prophecies were read by Frank
L. Argall. Miss Ethel R. Farnham and
Willarct D. Thompson.
The next event was the "Arrival of
Farmer Simkins," whose wife accom
panied him. The two, who were Ned
Blake and George Noble, proceeded to dis
pense fantastic and suggestive presents to
members of the graduating class. There
were some hard hits in the gifts offered
and much amusement was created.
The class-day poem, "To the University
of California," was by Miss Bertha T.
Bradley, daughter of Professor C. B. Brad
ley.
The class committee in charge of to-day's
celebration was as follows: Forenoon â
Martin O. Flaherty, Albert O. Warner,
Joseph O'Connor, Miss Ada G. Little, Miss
Mabel Symmes; afternoonâ Raymond J.
Russ, Phillip L. Bush, F. Herbert Dam.
Galen M. Fisher, Lou D. Whipple, Miss
Ethel R. Farnham.
Nearly all the Greek-letter fraternities,
according to the usual custom, entertained
their friends at luncheon.
The general criticism offered with rela
tion to the afternoon performances in the
amphitheater was that they did not
approach in excellence the exercises of
last year, when more of a spectacular
show was presented. The class of '96
instead of spending the entire amount
raised through the graduating assessment
decided to turn over the surplus to the
Le Conte fellowship fund.

The Rosso Cottage License Causes
Municipal Officials Much
Trouble.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 9.â There is
trouble between tne Chief of Police and
the License Collector's office regarding the
Rosjo cottage. The matter came before
the Council committee and the Chief said
the License Collector had tola him proper
arrangements to run the quarter out had
been made and therefore he could not
close it.
The law says no place can run without a
license, nor can a license be transferred
only by the Council, and the Chief's state
ment made the matter look rather queer.
Collector Cole denies that he ever told
Chief L'oyd that the license bad been
transferred. The officers will all be before
the Council Monday to explain ma ters.

TRICKY WORK
OF HUNTINGTON.
Secret Contracts Being Made
With San Joaquin
Shippers.
LOWER RATES OFFERED.
One of the Methods to Be Used
Against the Competing
Valley Road.
AFTEE THE WHEAT-GROWERS.
How the Matter Is Viewed by a
Prominent Merchant of the
Locality Affected.
Engrossed as C. P. Huntington's mind
must necessarily be with the attempt to
Dass a funding bill in Congress and to win
the suit pending in the Federal court in
this City to prevent a reduction in rates
by the State Railroad Commission, he has
still found time apparently to formulate a
plan by means of which he expects to con
trol a considerable portion of the trans
portation business of the San Joaquin
Valley for some time to come, in spite of
the advent of the Vulley road in that sec
tion of the State.
From a gentleman who is a large grain
grower and prominent in commercial
circles in the San Joaquin Valley and who
is now on a visit to this City, it is learned
that the Southern Pacilic Company now
has, and for some time has had, a large
corps of solicitors throughout the San
Joaquin Valley at the points which the
Valley road will touch, whose business it
is to make transportation contracts with
the large shippers of grain, as well as with
the more prominent merchants.
These contracts, according to the state
ment of tne gentlemen named, are drawn
for three years, provide for all transporta
tion business being done exclusively with
the Southern Pacific, and in return for this
the railroad company makes special rates,
considerably lower than those now in
force.
The wort of these solicitors is done in a
quiet and exceedingly cautious manner.
For this course there are two gooa reasons.
assigned. It is, of course, a most impor
tant requisite that the intending competi
tor of the Southern Pacific shall not be
made aware of what is beine done in this
direction, in order that the desired object â
that of freezing out this competitor from
its due share of business â may be accom
plished.
A further reason, and one not less
important, is that the contracts thus made,
giving as they do a lower rate to some
persons than are given to the general
public, are a violation of that clause of the
State constitution which prohibits dis
crimination in rates, reading as follows:
No discrimination in charges or facilities for
transportation shall be made by any railroad
or other transportation company between
places and persons, or the facilities for the
transportation of the same classes of freight or
passengers within the State or coming from or
going to any other State.
So carefully have the emissaries of the
Southern Pacific carried on their opera
tions that tneir work has not attracted
public attention heretofore, although they
have been at work for some weeks.
The Call's informant, for obvious rea
sons, does not desire to have his name di
vulged, as he was one of those approached
by an agent of the Southern Pacific. He
declined their overtures, however, as he
realized, he said, what would be the result
if the machinations of this corporation
were furthered by those whom the San
Joaquin road is designed to deliver from
the bondage of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. That this gentleman understands
the full import of the scheme of the Hunt
ington monopoly is shown in the words in
which he expressed himself.
"I cannot understand," he said, "how
any man with sound sense can be induced
to bind himself to the Southern Pacific
Company at this critical period for three
years. Surely every one wbo ships a
pound of freight out of the valley must
understand that any favors that are
granted, or appear to oe granted, by the
Souther Pacific at this time are simply
proffered in order that the path and
progress of the competing road now near
ing completion may be made difficult and
its operation, if possible, unprofitable.
"They seemingly do not realize that this
is not one of those projects that, owing to
the lack of capital, is likely to be bought
or controlled by Huntington & Co. They
lose sight of the fact that its head and
most enthusiastic projector is a man who
has undertaken to give the people of Cali
fornia a genuine competing railroad ; that
ne and his associates have the necessary
capital, perseverance and ability to cope
with the great monopoly, and, what is
more, have the desire and determination
to win victory in this great battle of
money, brains and principle.
"If the people of the San Joaquin Val
ley make any combination with the South
ern Pacific Company that is designed to
tamper or interfere in any way with the
progress and prosperity of the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley Railway
they will simply be thwarting tho efforts
of those whose interests are very closely
allied to their own, and any injury that
may result to the Valley road will be
reflected and intensified among them
selves. For the good reputation of the
valley, for its future welfare, for the wel
fare of the State, I should be extremely
sorry to learn that this latest scheme con
cocted by the Southern Pacific to retain its
monopolistic grip on the richest section of
the State is even partially successful."

It is highly important for each league to ob

accuracy as possible, giving the population of
the county from which the delegates come and
in which" the league is located â that is, the
total number of men, women and children m
the race in each county; the number engaged
in business pursuits, their different occupa
tions; the number of property-owners, the es
timated value of property owned by tnem, and
any other data that may 'lie important for tha
members of the congress to possess, and that
can be used to the advantÃgfi of tiie race his
torically. This is a very important mutter,
and it is most earnestly urged upon the differ
ent leugues the necessity of obtaining these
statistics and providing the delegates with
them for use by the congrt---.

the Government and true to every Instinct
and aspiration of liberty. Every member of
the race should regard" it as his duty, even
though some self-sacrifice be necessary, to at
tend the sessions of this congress if possible.
We are ambitious to fill places of honor and
trust, and this should be coupled with the
faculty to administer public affairs. Our peo

important in its history," said President
Morton yesterday. "There are many
matters of interest not only to ourselves
but the public at large to be considered.
The colored vote in this State now numbers
about 7000, and we feel that it is time some
acknowledgment was made for the good
we have done the Kepublican party."
The Bay State Restaurant.
A large crowd was entertained last even
ing at the Bay State restaurant, 13 and 15
Stockton street, by the proprietor, Max
Adler, and his assistants, the occasion
being the formal opening of the place since
its enlargement. Under Mr. Adler's man
agement this restaurant has acquired such
popularity that he found his old quarters
inadequate to accommodate his trade and
he has added the adjoining store, No. 13,
to his former quarters. In the new part is
located the bar, as well as the gentlemen's
entrance to the main dining-room, which
is located in the rear. The old number is
used for a separate entrance for ladies.
Twenty new private dining-rooms have
been added and the place has been reno
vated and repainted throughout. The Bay
State is famous for such delicacies as frogs'
legs, terrapin, etc., also for broiled steaks
and chops, ana is well patronized by epi
cures who appreciate the excellence of the
menu.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 10, 1896.
VERY REV, PRIOR VAUGHN,
A Brother of the Cardinal of
Westminster Is in the
City.
IS A COUSIN OF WOLSELEY.
The Churchman Received With Great
Distinction in Australia â Will Ec
Here Some Time.
Among the distinguished arrivals here
yesterday by the steamer Monowai was the
Very Rev. Prior Vaughn of Manchester,
England, wbo has been making a tour of
the Australian colonies, and who Mas been
received everywhere with great considera
tion ana courtesy.
Very Rev. Prior Vaughn is the brother
of the Cardinal Archbishop of West

The Very Rev. Prior Vaughn, Brother of the Cardinal of Westminster, and His
Secretary, Gerald Petre, Kclativc of the Duke of >orthrup.
[Sketched from life by a "CaU" artisL]
Wolseley. His younger brother, Colonel
Vaughn, Sir Charles Wolseley and othor
relatives are connected by marriage with
American families.
The notable churchman is accompanied
on his travels by Gerald Petre, a cousin of
Lord Petre, and who is aiso a connection
of the Duke of Norfolk.
The prior is a striking appearing man of
upward of 50 years, with a full, serious, vet
open countenance. Mr. Petre, who, the
prior said, had Kindly consented to accom
pany him and act as his secretary, is also
a man distinguished in appearance.
The gentlemen are at the Occidental in
company with several ministers of the
Episcopal church, who were fellow pa -
sengers on the Monowai. They will prob
ably spend some little time in California,
The prior dictated the following in re
card to where he and Mr. Petre had been
hitherto:
"We have visited all the Australian
colonies and have been received witn great
distinction by the leading men of the colo
nies, Governors and others, as well as the
heads of all the church?*."
This is the first time, he said, that he
had been on American soil. He referred
to Colonel Vaughn, his younger brother,
and to Sir Charles Wolseley, his cousin,
and other relatives who were connected by
marriage with American families.
"I have conceived a high estimate of the
American people," he said, "and am look
ing forward with great interest and lively
expectation of finding ideals realized on
this trip through America."
The distinguished churchman has ad
dressed many large audiences in Australia.
He is a very eloquent and impressive
divine.
ONE THUMB TOO MANY,
Abe Marks, Three Weeks Old,
Had Two of Them on His
Right Hand.
The Superfluity Was Amputated by
Dr. Weil at the Receiving
Hospital.
A baby boy, three weeks old, with two
thumbs on his right hand was a subject
of great interest at the Receiving Hospital
yesterday morning.
The baby, Abe Marks, was taken to the
hospital by his mother, Mrs. Marks, who
lives at 364 Minna street. He is a bright
little fellow, healthy and strong. His
father died a few days after nis birth.
Mrs. Marks told Dr. Weil that after the
baby was born she noticed the two thumbs

Whose Specialty Until Yesterday Was
the Possession of Three Thumbs.
on bis right band. It worried her so to
think that he would be deformed for life
that she had called at the hospital as soon
as she was able to see what could be done.
Dr. Weil said the best thing to do would
be to amputate the unnecessary thumb.
It would leave a slight scar for life, but
that would be much better than having
the two thumbs.
Mrs. Marks consented to the operation
and it was quickly performed by Dr. Weil.
The baby bore the operation like a veteran
and scarcely made a whimper.
The accessory thumb, which was ampu
tated, grew out in a straight line from the
metacarpal bone and was of perfect shape
and as long as the other.
Dr. Weil says that physical phenomena
of thu nature are not by any means rare.
SHE'S AN ACTRESS NOW
Suits Against Mr*. Lucy Anzerali Hoyte
and Her Husband for Service*
and Printing.
The career of Mrs. Lucy Auzerais Hoyte
as a professional actress has reached that
pomt â common to nearly all Thespians â
where summons to answer actions at law
are of frequent occurrence.
Her recent venture in opening the Al
cazar Theater with a big company was
apparently not a success, for several suits
have been begun to recover amounts
claimed to be due for professional services,
printing and other things absolutely neces
sary for a theatrical company. Emile

MILLIONS IN HIS MIND,
C. H. Billings, a Stockton Res
taurant Man, in a
Padded Cell.
His Wife and Four Young Children
Are Left Penniless in a
Strange City.
C. H. Billing*, who imagines himself to
be a multi-millionaire, was found wander
ing about the streets yesterday morning,
and was taken to the City Prison and later
placed in a padded cell in the Receiving
Hospital.
Billings is a restaurant man, and some
time ago, while in Stockton, sola out and
went to Sonora. He opened a restaurant
there, but sold out lately and returned to
Sotckton.
He and his wife and foui children arrived
here on Tuesday morning from Stockton.
They stopped at the Occidental Hotel for
two days and then engaged rooms at 303
Jessie street.
His wife had not seen him for two days,
and when she called at the City Prison
yesterday morning with her children In
quiring for him she was astonished to
learn that he was in the insane ward at
the hospital. She could assign no reason
for his mental derangement. To her
knowledge he had not met with any busi
ness reverses, but she could not under
stand where his money had gone and she
and her children were penniless. He had
often told her that he was a distant rela
tive of Millionaire Hillings of Moniana, and
he had come here to see if a part of the
estate had been left him. He also claimed
to be a relative of Josh Billings.
The police had been searching for Bil
lings for two o.' three days. The banks
had complained about him. He had been
sending in checks for fabulous amounts.
A complaint had also been received about
him from Montana, as he had been keep
ing the telegraph wires hot with demands
for his share of the Billings millions,
although notified that he was not a rela
tive. His surplus cash has been spent in
telegrams.
Billings' four children were sent by the
police to the Day Home, on Hayes street,
and the police are helping Mrs. Billings to
find two of her uncles, who live in the
City, so that she can get temporary
shelter with them.
THE BALLOON CHRISTENING.
A Novel Ceremony and an Ascension at
the Chutes To-Day.
The big new balloon "Chute 9" was In
flated and tested yesterday, and every
thine seems propitious for her first voyage

Arrival of the Steamship Mono
wai Yesterday From
Sydney.
KILLED B7 SOLOMON ISLANDERS
Captain H. L. Howison to Command
the Oregonâ A Mexican War-
Vessel in Port.
The Oceanic steamship Monowai, Cap
tain Carey, arrived yesterday morning
twenty-six days, nine hours and thirty
minutes from Sydney by way of Auckland,
Apia and Honolulu. She brought an un
usually large passenger list, of wiiich the
following named came in the cabin:
John Mills is one of the principal share
holders in the Union steamship line to
which belongs the Monowai. R. V. Web
ster ia a wealthy tea-planter from Ceylon
making a tour of the world. Joseph I.
Sheerin, a prominent architect from Syd
ney who designed all the principal build
ings of that city, is traveling around the
world. W. G. Irwin is the agent of the
Oceanic Steamship Company in Honolulu.
From the passengers of the Monowai de
tails of a wholesale murder of traders and
missionaries by Solomon Island head-hunt
ers are gleaned. The savages are reported
to have butchered tbe crew of a boat from
the trading brig Rio Loge, and at Rubiana
two French and one American trader
were killed. The mission on the island
had been attacked, and the white people
there begged the captain of the steamer
Titus to take them away.
The natives of the Manning Straits isl
ands are fierce and cruel, like those of the
Solomon group, and are given to cannibal
ism. Recently they lured ashore the
crews of two small trading-schooners and
put the luckless sailors to death. At
Southwest Bay, on Tounan Island, a mis
sionary named Boyd and one companion
were missing, and it is thought they have
been murdered. A number of trading
posts were found sacked and destroyed.
On the island of Nusa in the Bismarck
Archipelago a few weeks ago a chief
named Balek, who was known as a cruel
murderous man, fell into the hands of a
band of savages. He was sneared to death,
and his body roasted and eaten. The
feast lasted several hours.
The Mexican war vessel Zaragoza arrived
yesterday from Mazatlan. The following
are her officers :
Commander, Miguel Pozo; first lieutenant,
Cristobal Gonzalez Frances Ochoa; second
lieutenant, JoseServin; sublieutenants, Albert
Zenteno, Jose K. de Caceres, Francisco Riva

The vessel came to anchor off the Union
Iron Works, wxiere she will undergo re
pairs.
A number of 'change* have been made
among the assignments of naval officers at
Mare Island. Rear Admiral W. H. KirK
land, on waiting orders, has been ordered
to assume command of the navy-yard, re
lieving Captain H. L. Howison, who will

Concord and given two months' leave of j
absence; Passed Assistant Paymaster J. S.
Phillips, detached from the Bennington
and given three months' leave.
The steamer Farallon, which sailed from
this port May 7 for Yaquina Bay, re
turned yesterday for repairs, having struck
a rock* off Little River. She was only
slightly damaged.
The battle-ship Oregon left port for
Santa Barbara Coannel yesterday morn

OF MONTEREY
SEVEN young women of Monterey,
all of them bachelor maids, and
every bachelor maid of them a
school-teacher, have in a pic
turesque manner brought the
modern reform movement into associa
tion with the quaintness of the old Califor
nia capital.
They have brought the bloomer into the
old adobe dwelling pla
These girls, for they are not long out of
the Normal School, are self-reliant. Not
only are they able to ignore the sterner
sex, but they go In advance of their gen
eration so far that they can bid defiance
to the boarding-house keeper and do their
own work. They live in an ancient adobe
house, running a home oi their own, and
in a domestic way are as independent of
the world as ever new young women can
be. Their unique home establishment
grew out of di.-^atisfaction with boarding
houses and boarding-house keepers.
The young women are known as "Trie
Pleiades." They are Normal School grad
uates, and tueir exceptional self-reliance
may be ascribed to the circumstance that
they are all Californians. When they

went to Monterey to teach school they
encountered the inconvenience of hotel
and â  boarding-house life. They agreed
that reform was needed, and so they held
a formpj convention i>nd resolved to bring
about a reform.
Educational subjects were not consid
ered at that teachers' meeting. On the
contrary, the entire discussion was about
the homeâ about the home that they
should establish for themselves.
A result of the conference was that the
teachers decided to lease an' old adobe
house, a picturesque old structure with
walls three feet thick, and with deep ver

andas on two sides of the many-roomed,
two-storied building. The adobe that
they obtained is the Thomas O. Larkin
place.
This house, in which dignitaries now

historical were entertained in the days of
Mexican dominion, stands at the corner
of California and Alvarado streets. It is
a typical adobe building, long, low and
rambling. The tiled roof, nearly all
covered with green mos3, is in pretty con
trast to the whitewashed walls.
The old structure I ad been for years
without occupants, but in two or three
weeks the carpenters, painters and fur
nishers made it bright, homelike and
attractive.
The unique home of the girls, which
comes so near being "ideal," stands prom
inent among the historic adobes of old
Monterey.
The house was built by Thomas O. Lar
kin, in 1848. Mr. Larkin was then Ameri
can Consul at Monterey. It was the finest
structure that the adobe city could then
boa^t of. It is two-storied," with a wide
veranda running around two sides. The
courtyard in the rear is surrounded with
a high, tile-covered wall. In thisinclosure
ihe old time quadrilles were held.
In establishing their nome in the his
toric structure, the bachelor maids did not
have to entirely refurnish the building.
They found that the upper story was
quite well titled out with furniture of
Deautiful, antique design. This was all
imported by Larkin from China, and cost
thousands of dollars.
The furniture i? entirely of iron, wood
and onyx, put together without nail or
screw. Some of the tables, of which there
are several, weigh as much as 400 pounds
each. The value of each of the tables is
not less than $500.
There are lounges and divans of odd and
marvelous design. These are fifteen feet
in length and four in breadth. They have
hieh backs and ends and are covered with
. There are wide drawers that pul!
out from the front, with carved dragon
heads for knobs.
All the chairs are unwieldy, but are
handsomely carved.
One of the rocking-chairs is six feet high
and is so heavy that it cannot readily be
moved. The rockers are six or seven' feet
in length and are made of iron or steel,
bent in the shape of a wagon spring.
Men yet living remember the piano of
the Thomas O. Larkin days. That was an

wood. It still is in the old adobe, and is
the special delight of the bachelor maids.
Though the keys have somewhat turned
in color and are wo.-n considerably, the
tone is yet clear and sweet. This was tiie
second piano brought to this coast. The
first also is in Monterey and is owned by
Mrs. Abrego, a sister of the present owner
of the adobe mansion.
In 1850 this Larkin house, with sll its
furniture, was bought by Jacob P. Leese,
a prominent pioneer of San Francisco, and
has since fallen to his heirs. Mr. Leese
occupied the Louse up to the time of his
death in 1830.
As is well known, the house was the
scene of great festivity in the early days.'
Jacob Leese Jr., who resides in Monterey,
tells many interesting narratives of tile
old-time hospitality.
Captain Swasey of this City spent many
of his pioneer days there, as he was asso
ciated with Larkin. General Sntter was
on several occasions a guest within the
adobe wails.
All the court balls were held there, and
when any foreign officer was at Monterey
he was entertained by Larkin.
On the street, at the corner of the adobe,
is a hitching-post. This is a cannon,
which is planted muzzle downward. This
cannon was one of the three original puns
taken from the frigate Savannah to fortify
Fort Halleck.
When the enterprising young school
teachers secured a lease of the mansion,
they quickly dispelled the gloom which
long had hung about the place. In the
lower story the floors were all covered with
Japanese matting and skins. As some of

the doors connecting the rooms had to be i
fastened up to make the different suites,
the deep recesses left in the thick walls
were used as china closets, bookcases and
cabinets, and v.iih thÂ«'ir blue embroidered
portieres and draperies one would never
dream that they were designed for any
other purpose.
Ail rooms facing upon the verandas are
immense, for in the olden times they had
quadrilles, and all the dons and ladies of
the old times in Monterey danced there.
These large Jront rooms have been util
ized by the girls as living-rooms, and the
visitor never fancies, when seeing the low.
wide divans, covered with tapestries of
artistic design and adorned with tlonncfd
pillows, that these luxurious siesta ar
rangements can be transformed into com
fortable beds. While the divans look neat
and pretty, they are useful and save room.
Screens hide the dressing tables.
A little discovery resulting from linger
ing traces of the old-fashioned feminine
curiosity added to the interest of the
Pleiades' early occupancy of the adobe.
In one of the walls was detected a little
secret recess, which in the olden days may
have been the hiding-place for the family
plate and jewels. Stowed away in that
place were found two pairs of antique
candlesticks, carved in curious design.
The young iadies have a footstool of the
vertebra of a whale, which they picked up
while on a ramble along the coast. They
are always on the alert for relics, and their
rooms are filled with rare old curiosities.
The large "living-rooms" open into a
cozy little dining-room. Where the win
dows face "upon the garden in the rear,
which used to be the pride of the Spanish
grandees, is now an inclosure with high
adobe walls where- honeysuckles, palm
trees and sweetbriars grow.
Within the adobe walls the bachelor
maids think they have an ideal home. It
is no boarding-place. There they can dis
cuss, entirely away from the world, their
own ideas. The walls have no ears, and it
would be pretty hard to hear through
three feet of adobe. One of their dearest
principles is dress reform.
They all wear tneir reform suits in the
schoolroom, and, although at first the
children stared instead of studied, they
are now used to the sight and behave as
well as they did before the innovation
which proves, the teachers say, the falsity
of the assertion that short skirts, bloomers
and leggins detract from a woman's dig
nity.
The first appearance of the bloomers
upon the streets of Monterey caused the
descendants of the men and women of the
Alcalde days to pause and ponder and
shake their heads. Not a word of ap
proval have they for the latter-day Ameri
can women who walk or ride through the
streets without the ancient and orthodox
style of skirts.
All forms of open-air exercise available
for young women are popular with the
teachers. The seventeen-mile walk or
bicycle run on Cypress drive Is frequently
indulged in. Other Monterey girls often
join the Pleiades on the pedestrian excur
sions, which include the trips to Point
Pines and the lighthouse, and sometimes
as many as twenty-rive of the "bloomer
girls" are seen together on the roads about
Monterey or Pacific Grove.
The Pleiades have distinguished them
selves in fishing and boating and at times

have interested the inhabitants of the
adobe town by their exciting boat races.
I'.luomer costumes are not worn exclu
sively. In walkins some of the girls wear
skirt's which reach to the knee?. When
they go bicvele riding, however, they woar
the unmodified bloomer?.
The bloomer suit of the Pleiad is tailor
made and graceful. It has pockets at the
sides and straps for the belt and resembles
knickerbockers, with the exception of
â rreater width. The goods is a heavy blue
blnck serge.
The wearer also has a Scotch cap with a
large mother-of-pearl ornament and a blacK

feather at the side. Her leggins are of
mole-colored corduroy and button, instead
of buckle, up the side. A light shirt waist
and patent-leather boots complete a very
comfortable and durable outing outfit, with
a belt of Mexican-stamped leather, so much
worn in the South.
All the girls are early risers, and every
morning they may be seen, tramping,
bicycling, bathing, searching the rocks for
curious shells or having a lively bout on
the tennis courts.
They have a romantic, delightful home,
and they are happy in it.
Hard to Tell Apart.
Among the many representatives that
have come on from the Indian Territory
this winter to aid Congress in legislating
for that region are two young lawyers,
both citizens of the flourishing town of
Ardmore, bearing the names of Douglass
and Ledbetter. They are both bright men
and successful in their profession, good
friends and have offices in the same build
ing. Though not at all related, they bear to
each other the most wonderful resem
blance in form and features.
They are as much alike probably as any
twins ever were, even to height and weight.
People of the town get them mixed up
constantly, and clients who get into
the wrong office take Douglass for
Ledbetter, ana vice versa. The
children of each have no more
than one occasion called the wrong man
papa. Douglass is a stanch Republican,
ami his friend is equally as stalwart a Dem
ocrat. The former is not only learned in
the law, but is a writer of capital dialect
verse.â Washington Post.

THE HOME OF THE BACHELOR MAIDS.
[From a photograph. \
THE old stage that is at present
running between San Jose and
Alviso is probably the most
ancient vehicle in use in Califor
nia to-day. Just when it was made
or by whom is a fact of which there is no
record. Judging from a careful examina
tion, however, it is likely that it is the
identical American stagecoach exhibited
at the Crystal Palace in London in 1851, a
description of which was published in the
Art Journal at the time.
The old coach is battered and worn, but j
not enough to obliterate the fine work that j
was put on it. This work is of such a
degree of excellence as to indicate that the
coach was intended for show purposes as
well as hard use. The way the paint and
varnish has lasted also indicates that an
extra quality of material was used.
All that ia known of the old coach for
certain is that it came to San Francisco in
1554, having been brought around the
Horn in a Bailing vessel. It was sold at
once and for ten years did service ia differ
ent parts of the State.
The present owner of the coach is Ed
Marlatt. He bought it about the year
1^34 and put it on the road between San
Jose and Alviso, where it has been running
ever since without any repairs except to
the wheels. It made regular connections
with the steamers that ran between this
city and Alviso and transferred all of the
passengers to San Jose. In the early days
the coaoh returned a good income and the
driver, Ed Marlatt. did a line business. He
soon acquired considerable property about
Alviso, the most valuable of all being the
big brick warehouse in which the San
Jose freight was stored until Ed's teams
could transport it to its destination. Ed
was the king of that section of the coun
try in those days and could have been a
Senator had he wanted to.
The broad-gauge railroad made the first
cut at the business of the old stage, and
Alviso began to lose some of its import
ance. But when the narrow gauge went
directly through the little town that settled
it. The wharves began to rot away and
the idle warehouses to fall to pieces. But
there was always a little business until the
steamboat line put on its own stage to San
Jose.
But Ed never for a moment thought of
going away. Not much. He and his old
coach hadhelped to make the town and
he intended to stick to it even though he
didn't mane a cent. And he has stuck to
it. in spite of the fact thru things kept get
ting worse every day. As Ed had no use
for the warehouse he concluded to use it
for a stable instead of paying rent else
where. Somewhat later he decided to
move into the warehouse himself and save
that much more. And there he has been
domiciled for several years.
Ed's business is at present confined al
most entirely to the transportation of
Chit.ese. He has a corner on this busi
ness, as he curries them between San Jose
and Alviso for 10 cents. On such days as
the boat makes cheap trips to San Fran
cisco Ed has all he ca:i carry, and the
co^ch certainly looks picturesque with its
motley loud and tired horses. Ed and his
old coach are inseparable. Even though
he wants to go to a certain place only a
few miles away he will "hitch up" and go
in the coach nil by himself.
People in San Jose have become so used
to the coach that they pay no attention to
it when it pas.-es along the streets, but if
it should drop into any other city it would
be sure to draw large crowds. There is
certainly no more picturesque vehicle in
existence. The forty years oi service have
told on it in more ways than one, but it is
just as good for transportation purposes as
ever. Every bit Of wood in it is perfectly
sound, and if the broken windows were re

RUNNING A LOCOMOTIVE.
What It Means to Speed a Train Sixty
Mile!* per Hour.
To May Ladies' Home Journal John Qil
mer Speed contributes an article upon the
safety and coiuforts of railroad travel in
the United States, in which he says that
the highest type of American railroad is
to-day constructed with such skill and
sagacity that we travel in more luxury and
more security than any people in tne
worid.
In considering the locomotives and the
speed attained by them on pur railroads,
Mr. Speed says: * * At sixty miles an
hour tie resistance of a train is four times
as great as it is at thirty milesâ that is,
the'fuH must be four times as great in the
one case as it is in thj other.
But at sixty miles an hour this fuel
must be exerted fora given distance in
half the time iliut it is in thirty miles, so
I that the amonn' of power exerted and
| fteam generated in a given period of time
| must be eight times as great as the faster
speed. This mean 3 that the capacity of
the boiler, cylinders and the other parts
must be greater with a corresponding ad
dition to the weight of the machine.
Obviously, therefore, if the weight per
wheel, on account of the limit of weight
that the rails will carry, is limited, we
soon reach a point when the driving
wheels and other parts cannot be further
enlarged, and then we reach the maximum
i of speed.
The nice adjustment necessary of the
various parts ot these immense engines
may be indicated by some figures as to the
work performed by these parts when the
locomotive is worked at high speed. Take
â  a passenger engine on any of the big rail
i roads.
At sixty miles an hour a driving-wheel
â¢V., feet in diameter revolve* live times
i every second ; now the reciprocating parts
I of each cylinder, including one piston,
piston-rod, crosshead and connecting
' rod, weighing about f>so pounds, must move
| back and forth a distance equal to the
i stroke, usually two feet, every time the
! wheel revolves, or in a fifth of a second. It
i starts from a state of rest at the end of
j each stroke of the piston, and must ac
i quire a velocity of thirty-two feet per sec
ond in one-twentieth of a second, and
must be brought to a state of rest in the
same period of time.
A piston eighteen inches in diameter
' has an area of 254U square inches. Steam
j of 150 pounds pressure per square inch
would, therefore, exert a force <>n the pis
ton equal to 38,170 pounds. This force is
applied alternately on each side of the
piston ten times in a second.
Pensive Penciling!.

HOW GEO FRANCIS TRAIN
HELD UP THE GERMAN MAIL.
1 FIRST met GeoFge Francis Train just
two days before I started with him on
that sixty-seven day tour of the world
- from Tacoma to Tacoma. The start
was made on the 16th of March, 1890.
Going out of Commencement Bay by
special steamer to meet the Canadian
trans- Pacific liner Abyssinia in the Royal
Roads opposite Victoria, we rode into
Tacoma by special train from the East on
the afternoon of the , an interval
of sixty-seven days between the farewell
waved to the gay crowd of excursionists on
the steamer Olympian in the 6traits of
Fuca and the greeting to the other gay
crowd with its other brass bands in the
streets of Tacoma seemed, when it was
done, but a twinkling, and yet, seen
through the experiences that bad come
between, seemed a decade. Figuratively, it
was a cup of tea in Japan, "'just one more
in China, a sniff at the spices of Ceylon
and Araby, a glass of wine in Paris, a
momentary struggle with a London fog,
and then New York and the crash ol the
brass band and cannons on the
hills of Tacoma. Literally, it was
sixty-seven days' driving behind the
world's swiftest engine, sixty-seven days
churning the ocean and roaring over rails
westward. And none of the peoples of all
the earth will forget that sixty-seven-day
visitation. It recurs to me like a torch
light procession, with unbroken ranks and
skyrockets and red fire and a long trail of
astonished natives.
The Olympian and the Abyssinia lashed
together in the Straits of Fuca and Train
and I stepped from the one to the other.
The one backed away, and while the band
played and the crowd yelled, neaded for
Victoria; the other started her ponderous
machinery with her nose pointed toward
a stormy ocean and the Orient.
W hat I had seen of George Francis Train
up to that time was simpfy a man of un
usual vitality, a public speaker of unusual
capacity to entertain, a man of apparently
unusual executive capacity, thinking of a
thousand details of his trip and keeping
everybody about him busy with prepara
tions while he himself pnve his time to
every little tot that came into his room or
crossed his path. To be sure when intro
duced he kept his hands to himself, fold
ing them together while bowing in the
most courtly fashion. His "eccentricity"
in this matter was well known, however,
and taken in connection with his abun
dant pood spirits was passed with a smile.
Now, however, he and I were alone, co to
speak. For, although our sensational
entry into the ship had brought passen
gers and crew on deck, they stood aloof,
and we were shown to our two big state
rooms on the lower deck and for the first
time sized each other up as inseparable
for the next two months or so.
"We are going on an important mis
sion," said Train. "We are to show the

real way round the earthâ the short way.
Do you drink and carouse around?"
I told him I was simply a plain news
pa pei man, but that I would do the best I
could.
Train had been an irrepressible joker
himself up to this time. Now he said:
"On the contrary. I do not drink anything
myself, and we must keep our heads about
us for this business. We will travel like
princes, but we will be very busy at every
post. We must make absolute connection
everywhere or the enterprise will fall flat."
For sixteen days we plunged through
bleak and stormy seas, with rain and
snow accompaniment. We had counted
on fourteen days across. There had been
no plan beforehand, however. We knew
notmng of the sailing days of ships west
ward in the Orient. It was simply a trust
ing to Train's "psychics" â another name
for luck. The loss of two days on the
Pacific did not disturb him in* the least.
He was the same philosopher in raid
ocean that he had been in Madison square.
On the 2d of April, fourteen days out. a
faint line of purple came into the western
horizon. As Train and I stood at the
ship's rail watching it, he with a glass and
his big fur-collared coat buttoned about
him, he said: "That is Japan. In forty
eight hours we begin business. Running
forty miles an hour, once, across the
American continentâ l was conducting a
party of notables over the first Pacific road
âI touched a light to the prairie at night

and awoke the sleeping train to see the
sea of tire. Y'oa are rarely fortunate. You
will witness the like again. lam about to
set the prairie on fire. I have the twist
upon the world. I shall enter the United
States like Monte Cristo rising from the
sea. I have found the riches and the world
is mine."
On the morning of the 4th of April we
rounded into the harbor at Yokohama.
The day was beautiful and as we ran up
the bay through the moving life and
color of the harbor, dotted witn sampans
and stranee sea cruft, with hÂ»re and there
* big ooean liner, the roofs of Yokohama
making jatrged points along the rim of the
sea, while Fujiyama lifted its white cone
into the distant sky and the water about
us sparkling with light and life, the sen
sation vas like that of drinking wine.
Train had been on deck since daybreak.
With his glass c was studying the flags
in the harbor, looking for the English or
German, for they are fast sailers. We
slowed down some distance out and a
pilot came on board and told him that
the General Werder â North German
Lloyds â had sailed two days before to
make connections with vessels of its own
lino clear into the Mediterranean. Ttier*
would not be another vessel south in a
week.
Do you think that rattled the chief? Not
a bit of it.
"Well, well, let us go to breakfast," he
said. "We will see about it when we get
ashore. "
The 4th of April happened to be Good
Friday, and in this land of Buddha was
religiously observed. The town was prac
tically shut up. We took a rickshaw to
the office of the Japan Gazette, enlisted
the editor, wto led the way to the resi
dence of the agent of the German Lloyds.
Arrived there we found the door locked
and the blinds drawn. The agent was still
abed.
He was awakened by a clamor at his
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 10, 1&96.
door. He heard his little Japanese maid
pull back the bolts in the hallway, and
i card men's loud insistent voices and her
timid remonstrance that her master must
not be disturbed ; he heard footsteps ap
proach bis own bedroom, and then an
alarming knocking upon the panels of the
door. He sprang out of bed.
"Who's there?" he cried.
"George Francis Train, sixteen days
from Tacoma. bound round the world in
sixty days. Come! let me in."
"What do you want? I'm in my night
shirt."
"Very well; Seep it on! Come, let me
in, I'm in a hurry! 1 want to catch the
Werder."
"The General Werder sailed two days
ago."
"Oh, come, open the door! Don't you
suppose I know that? I want to catch
her."
Douutingly Herr Leopold turned the
key in the lock, and then the door was
pushed open from the other side and
three men walked in. He of the con
versation was a tall, large-framed man
with snow-white hair and gray mustache,
extremely rapid in manner and speech,
faultlessly dressed in a gray suit, brown
overcoat, gloves and patent-leather shoes
The line of argument was generally in
terrupted.
"Where is the Werder now?" asked
Train.
"At Kobe."
"Kobe is 300 miles down the coast and
can be reached by rail?"
"Yes."
"When will she sail from there?"
"To-morrow morn in â¢."
"She sails with the tide?"'
"No. There is plenty of water where
she lies."
"It is twenty-four hours from here.
What time does a train leave?"
"At 3 this afternoon."
41 It would be too late. You must hold
the vessel."
"Impossible, sir. It cannot be done.
Under any circumstances it cannot. The
General Werder carries the German mail."
But it was done. As an excuse for say
ing all that he did pay in the time he took
to it Train explatned that he was in a
hurry. He told Leopold that it meant
two first-class passages from Kobe to the
canal â almost a third the way round the
earthâ worth in money $800; in fame with
out price. This trip was history, he must
get into it. We had a kodak with us; we
would take a photograph of the agent in
his nightshirt in the act of sending the
mpssage that held the Werder.
It was effective. Mr. Leopold rang; his
little Japanese girl i responded; by his or
der she brought a bottle of yellow label.
Having been won to the enterprise sne be
came enthusiastic in it, and Anglin, the
editor, was so delighted that he hugged
and kissed the little Japanese girl re
peatedly. But he might have done that
upon Blighter provocation. She only
smiled and was still demure.
Then we jumped into the rickshaws
again and rode to the Consul's office.
There was a little rush of pleased excia
mation and reminiscence at the meeting
with Consul Greathouse and then Train
stated the business: "I am on my every
twenty-year tour of the world. I want
passports for two."
"Ah!" said Greathouse. "That is red
tape. You will have to see the American
Minister, Mr. Swift, at Tokio,"
"Very well. Can you tell me about the
train ?â¢'
"It leaves at 11."
"And when return?"
"At 2."
"That will do nicely. It will give me
thirty minutes in Tokio. lam to catch
the 3 o'clock train for Kobe."
"The 3 o'clock train for Kobe!" The
Consul laughed. "You might as well sit
down and be easy, for that is impossible."
"Why? Impossible seems to be very
lightly spoken in Japan."
"Well, It is impossible," he repeated.
"Minister Swift win have to seethe Japan
ese Minister, and there is a whole lot of
hocus pocus. Besides this is a Japanese
holiday and I don't think you could get
one of them to move in the matter to-day
even if they could be found, which is very
doubtful. A passport has never been ob
tained under the most favorable circum
stances and strongest pressure in less than
three days."
"What," exclaimed Train, "three days
to sign a paper? It is time, then, that I
reduced the limit to about three minutes.
You watch me."
I did not go to Tokio, but between 11
and 2 o'clock saw Yokohama. At 2 o'clock
a little party of friends, invited, sat and
stood about a table in the dining-room of
the Grand Hotel watching the clock. The
waiters stood by equally anxious. The
guests tried their best to" make it appear
that they did not feel silly. Anglin, the
editor, who had been shifting the resDon
sibility of his 200 pounds from one leg to
another, made a mental note that the
clock marked twelve minutes past 2, and
that that was three minutes slower than
his watch, when Consul Greathouse
laughed outright, saying that if the dinner
was to cook until Train came back with a
passport, there would be very little use in
ordering anything rare.
A bauquet without the host would be
100 novel to attempt in the Orient and
they might as well â A whirlwind swept
some napkins to the floor and George
Francis Train despatched seven waiters in
search of oysters and snipe and wine, and
begged his guests to be seated.
"We have forty minutes ta eat and
drink and talk and catch the train," he
said. "The passports? Certainly. I
don't eat meat myself, waiter; bring me
some Lyonai3B potatoes and a biscuit.
And speaking of passports reminds me of
the last time I was at Tokio, in '70. There
was an English minister, Sir rienry
Parkes, who moved in greater splendor
than the Mikado.
"His carriage was drawn by four white
horses, and he ha<l a more brilliant retinue
than Thomas a Beci>et. He rode through
the streets looking straight before him,
not noticing native or foreigner except of
the higher order. He was the most mighty
thing in all Japan â the English Minister
â and that just after Commodore Perry
and I bad made it possible for him to come
ashore. I saw him drive by once, and my
private secretary, George Pickering Bemis,
now Mayor of Omaha, stepped to one side
to make room for him. 'Never do that
again,' said I. 'To-morrow at this time
you come here with six white horses, and
when you make this ambitions Minister
turn out for you, he will probably ask you
who you are. Then tell him you are my
private secretary.' Waiter, some more
wine for these gentlemen."
As a part of the singular luck that fol
lowed us round the world this train that
we took that afternoon was the last that
was to travel over the road until the fourth
day following. The Emperor had been
reviewing his troops at Kioto, the demon
stration was over and the Government
was to take charge of the road for the dis
tribution of the troop".
The train ran into the station at Kobe a
little after 3 o'clock. It had not come to
a full stop when the door swung open and
a lusty German voice said, "Are you Mr.
Train'?"
"Yes."
"Where is your baggage? I am the
agent of the Norddeutscher Lloyd. We
have been waiting for you and want to get
you aboard as quickly as possible."
Our string of satchels and trunks were
piled on two trucks, we mounted the ever
present rickshaw and a beautiful race took
place to the quay. There a customs offi
cer just glanced "into one of the trunks,
we tumbled into a sampan, and a few
moments later stood on the deck of the
General Werder, which, with steam up and
anchor weighed, was standing in the
roadstead. Thus, by the capture of the
German mail, with its complete line of
connections round into the Mediterranean,
the swiftest tour of the world was made
reasonably certain.

FAMOUS.
year 1872 can be set down as
jj marking the beginning of art cul
* ture in San Francisco. It was
J| then that a little group of talented
fellows began to form plans for
getting some sort of study. They started
the Graphic Club, laid the foundations for
tne School of Design and began a struggle
that has led several of them to fame.
At first these earnest young men used
such rooms as they could afford to rent
temporarily for the purpose of sketching
from life. All worked at some sort of un
congenial business during the day, and
could only draw a few hours at night. A
number worked at painting in their own

homes and when they thought they had
enough "stuff" to exhibit they "clubbed"
in and rented a hall for one night. It was
thrown open to the public and hundreds
came to look at the pictures, but in those
days purchasers were mighty scarce. As
the years went by the artists became more
and more Btrongly banded together.
Everybody with any talent tried to make
uae of it and encouraged others. Art
never struggled against greater odds nor
had less advantages than it did here in
San Francisco, but the result is most grat
ifying and encouraging and still further
proves the old theory that genius can ex
ist anywhere and will not be suppressed.
Three men whose fame to-day is world
wide did their first studying in San Fran
cisco. Two women have climbed high on
the ladder of National fame, and several
young men have taken rank with the best
in America and promise greater things in
the future.
Tracy, the great painter of scenes in
American hunting-fields, has been most
strongly identified "with the art growth of
this City. Before there was any thought
of organization Tracy was a hard worker.
He had no fundamental instruction at all.
but simply worked from nature, add
painted such things as pleased him. When
the Graphic Club and School of Design
started he was one of the men who de
voted considerable of bis time to study
and also to the instruction of others not
as far advanced as himself. In some way
Tracy seemed to know what was good in
art, for be made steady improvement as
the years went by. In the latter part of
the seventies Tracy moved to St. Louis,
where he did well in a financial way, and
brought his work to such a high standard
of artistic excellence that it soon attracted
attention. In 1883 be went to New York
and at once took a position as one of the
great painters of this country. Since then
his fame has constantly been on the in
crease. Every picture he paints is sold
before it is off the easel, and there is a con
stant demand for reproductions of them.
His "Hunting Grouse" is perhaps his
most famous work. The landscape is full
I of light and color, and the figures of men.
i dogs and birds are painted in a masterful
I manner. When Tracy was in San Fran
cisco his work sold at any price he could
getâ from $5 to $25. Now he seldom gets
less tLan $1000 for even a very small work.
His "Autumn in the Fields," one of his
late works, sold for $5000.
Alexander Harrison is conceded to be
{ one of the greatest marine painters in the
I world to-day. He ia also an old San
I Francisco art student, who began his
career on his own account. He first made
sketches around the bay, and realizing
that he had talent he joined the Coast Bur
vey for the purpose of studying water.
Xli is undoubtedly did him a great deal oi
good in the way of impressing the effect of
the ocean on his mind.
By the year 1876 the School of Design
was on a iair basis, and Harrison went in
for a course of instruction. He remained
two years, but his studies were not con
sidered of any great importance. His
studies from nature made at the time are
also lacking in many of the things that go
to make up a genius. The painting from
which the accompanying drawing was
made is a very weak piece of work. The
water is flat and dry, and the drawing of
the boats is very poor.
Alexander Harrison left Ban Francisco
in 1879 for Philadelphia, where he re
mained for about Iwo years studying in
the Bchool of Design tnere. He then
went to Paris, wherehe has practically re-
mained ever since. He studied with the
best masters, and it was not long before he
was able to make use of the vast amount
of knowledge be had acquired while in the
Coast Survey and when studying the
waters of the bay of San Francisco. In
1887 a prize of $3000 was offered (or the
best picture by an American artist, to be
exhibited in "New York one year later.
Harrison came back from Paris on pur
pose to compete. He felt that lie would
have a good show, but his picture took the
p.rt world by surprise and captured the
prize. It was entitled 'La Crepescule,"
and has been said by many eminent
critics to be the finest and most realistic
bit of water ever painted. This work is at
present in St. Louis, but it has been re
produced so many times that it is known
all over the world. To look at "La
Crepescule" it is hard to realize that it is
nothing but paint and canvas. Every
wave seems to be dancing toward the
shore, and the light of the rising moon is
reflected in a thousand points of scintillat-

ing brilliancy. One forgets that one is in
an art gallery, and seems to hear the low
murmur of the surf pulsating through the
evening atmosphere. Harrison has never
stopped in his art, but is constantly mak
ing improvement. He exhibited a picture
about a year ago that the great Mesdag de
clared to be a masterpiece.
Palmer Cox, the creator of the Brown
ies, is known to aimost every person in
America and England. He began his art
career in this City about 1872. At the time
ho was working at his trade of jeweler, but
found occasional opportunities to attend
the Graphic Club and School of Design.
He was very industrious and worked from
life a great deal, but did not show any ex
ceptional talent. He did not show any
trace of what he was goiug to build his
fame on. His great effort was always to
draw portraits. "" It was a difficult matter
for him, however, and his career Bhows
that his strong point lay in tne direction
of caricature. The accompanying draw
ing of' Thomas Hill was made in 1575,
when he had been working several years!
To give it all the credit it deserves it can
only be said to De very ordinary. It shows
a lack of the comprehension of fni^^^l
slso timidity in the way of handling the
pencil. Of course Palmer Cox can liardiv
be said to be a great artist, but there is no
denying the fact that he is a genius. The
Brownies are the fun nirst caricatures O f
human beings ever made, and his ability
to weave them into peculiar incidents has
been one of the things that has helped to
make him famous. Palmer Cox's firn
Brownies were drawn for St. Nicholas
about 1879, but his best work was dona
two years ago. It was a series of articles
in the Ladies' Home Journal entitled
'â¢The Brownies' Trip Around the World."
Theodore Wores was one of the first
students to attend the School of Design.
He showed a strong inclination toward
still-life subjects, and always selected
those with plenty of color in them. After
about two years of study he went to
Munich and worked under a number of
the best masters. He then made two
trips to Jat>an, and is, perhaps, best known
by the work he did there. Mr. Wores'
work is very well known in this City, but
whenever he has exhibited in the great
art centers of the world he has always had
the most favorable criticism. He was one
of the pioneers in Japanese subjects, and
many of his pictures have been sold for
large sums. At present he is in New
York, engaged on some important orders
with which he feels greatly encouraged.
Julian Rix is also an old San Francisco
art student. He worked in the School of
Design for several years, but demonstrated
to himself that he would do better in land
scape than anything else. He soon ranked
as the best in his field in the State. All of
the grand California scenery has been
painted by him, but he did not achieve
fame until he went to New York about
rive years ago. He at once sprang into
prominence, and to-day is at the head of
his profession. Some of his later work
has been declared to be magnificent in
tone and. at the same time," having an
originality of execution that places it on a
le-el with that of the great masters of the
world. His work is reproduced to a large
extent and sold all over the country.
Miss Lotz was one of the first pupils of
the School of Design. She worked there
for nearly six years before going to
Europe. Her talent was discovered by
Dan Cook, who provided several years'
instruction for her under the famous
animal painter, Van Mark. She produced
several good pictures that sold readily and
has been constantly improving. All of her
work has been confined to animals. It is
of a high order of merit and gives her a
strong position in the art world, out as yet
she has not produced a real masterpiece.
Miss Lizzie Strong bears a high reputa
tion-in the world of art as a painter of
dogs. She went to the School of Design
about 1876 and remained there for over
four years when she went to Paris and
studied in the schools and under different
masters. Her work is known all over the
world and several of her pictures are owned
in this City. It ia strong in color and the
drawing is exceptionally good. She also
manages to get a great deal of sentiment
in her work that eives it an individuality
sure to lead her to the highest round of the
ladder of fame.
The well-known water color painter,
Harvey Young, got hia first knowledge of
art in San Francisco. He was a member
of the Graphic Club and did considerable
work in the School of Designs He is best
known to-day as a painter of Mexican
scenes. He never attempts anything
large, but gets good prices for all the small
things he can paint. His studio is in New
York, but most of his work is done out of
doors, so that he spends most of his time
in Mexico.
Of the artists who have achieved local â¢
fame nearly all obtained their first
instruction at the School of Design. In
fact the best artists in California are en
tirely the home product.JUDGE HUSE.
DRAMATIC in many of its details
and full of rniman interest is the
story of Judge Charles E. Huse,
for whose release from the in
sane asylum at Highlands the
most strenuous efforts lave recently been
made. His case has already attracted the
attention of press and public, and if the
contentions of the Judge's friends may ba
relied upon (and the circumstances seem
to indicate that their c'aims are not alto
gether without foundation in fact), then it
is in all probability true that a sane man,
whose mind is still brilliant, even after
long years of association with the de
mented, is being restrained of his liberty.
Asa brief introduction to the particulars
which follow let it be said that Judge
Charles E. Huse, at one time one of the
prominent attorneys of Southern Califor
nia, was in 1880 committed from Santa
Barbara County to the Napa Insane
Asylum. Ten years later he was dis
charged, but immediately sent back to ]
Napa from San Francisco, and in 1894 sent
to the branch asylum at Highlands, in
San Bernardino County.
The friends of Huse maintain that ene
mies conspired to send the attorney to the
asylum and to keep inni confined as a j
means to the success of a plot to obtain i
â possession of a large estate, consisting of
5000 acres of land to which Judge Huse
held some title.
Whether Judge Huse be sane or not, or
whether or not his long confinement
among people of shattered minds hasÂ«at
length caused his own intellect to totter
on its throne, may not be said from direct
knowledge; but there is something which [
can De said, with reference to this remark- j
able case, that lends to a portion of the i
story a life coloring that smacks of the â 
olden, golden days, and that equals in its
eiow and glory some of the best chapters
of romance. There is something in the
story that strikes one as deeply as the
Pythian legend. There are heroes in this |
land to-day as picturesque, as noble- i
minded, as self-sacrificing as the best of ;
those whose types adorn the most touch
ing earlier tales of Bret Harte.
Gallardo â lawyer, miner, true-blue friend
of Judge Huseâ is a character for a
splendid Western sketch. Xhe indomitable
spirit of '49 is in him, and he exemplifies
an everlasting friendship when he practi
cally declares to his revered old tutor: â¢
"Enemies may rob you ; but you will never |
rant while there ie treasure in Gallardo's j
mines." He does not merely say it â he
deeds half his wealth to the man in the j
asylum, and then proceeds to battle like a .
Trojan for his friend's release. The pic- '
ture of Gallardo riding down from the
Nevada hills to make a tight in the courts
for Judge Huseâ and for no object other
than that of pure friendshipâ is one that
must excite admiration in every honest
breast.
But the story is best told in these two
chapters â one describing the coming of
"the friend in need"â the other, the sad
spectacle of a man vainly struggling for
what he deems his God-given right; fight
ing, too, against great odds from behind
the bars which have so long imprisoned
him.
"THE FRIKND IX NKKD."
Gallardo Rides From Nevada to Do
Battle for Judge Huse.
SANTA ANA, Cal.. May B.â Few men i
in the ordinary walks of life have excited
more genuine interest amon? those with
whom they have come in contact than
F. V. Gallardo, the shrewd and picturesque
Nevada miner, who rode astride his trusty
steed all the way from Hawthorne, in the
sagebrush State, to Southern California
and inaugurated proceedings to liberate
his old friend, Charles E. Huse, from the
P. F. Gallardo as He Appeared on the Streets of San Bernardino. He Had Come
All the Way From Nevada to Aid in Rescuing His Old Instructor From Con
finement in the Asylum,
[Sketched by a "Call artist."]
Highlands Insane Asylum, in San Ber
nardino Cour.ty. After an exciting con
test in Judge Otis' court in that county
Mr. Huse has been remanded to the insti
tution in which, it was set forth, he had I
been unlawfully confined. But Gallardo,
with the energy and determination which
ar<> bo characteristic of him, has given
notice of an appeal, and evidently intends
to carry the case to the end of the means
provided by law.
It was during Mr. Gallardo's visit to
Santa Ana in quest of Dr. G. W. Hollister,
an old friend both of himself and Judge
Huso, for the purpose of securing him
as a witness in the action, through which
it was hoped to restore the freedom from
the asylum of a sane man placed and re
tained* there through conspiracy, that
some of our people became acquainted
with the curious character, whose life has
been peculiarly balked with reverses and
whose natural keenness and wide cultiva
tion of mind are at once made apparent in
conversation.
The personal appearance of Gallardo is |
one of the most deceiving features of the
man. Attired in a time-worn sombrero,
through the brim of which a pencil is
stuck for safe-Keeping, with fringed and
threadbare coat and vest, blue overalls,
heavy shoes, dark tlainel shirt and a mass
of bandana handkerchief around bis
tiroat, his aspect inspires the conclusion
that the visitor is a rheep-herder or per
haps a wandering old man without even
as good a job. A bushy white beard
covers his face, which is clearly of Spanish
lineage and the entire hirsute condition
evinces dim acquaintance with the barber.
As soon as conversation is opened, how
ever, one is not left in doubt as to the
ability and attainments of this uncouth
lawyer, who refrains from the common
equipments and practices of civilization
either from choice or necessity. Polished
let'ul phrases How from him in a manner
that is truly surprising; perfect command
of the English language is always appa
rent, and the extraordinary precision with
which he settles on dates of events in
years far back is one pf the most wonder
ful exhibitions of the mental training he
has undergone.
Years ago, in 1855. Mr. Gallardo com
menced the study of law under Judge
Huse at Santa Barbara. He was the:i a
young man of 21. Four years later he wa*
admitted to the bar of the Superior Court
of that county, and subsequently gained
admission to all the higher tribunals of
the land. He at once assumed consider
able prominence in his profession, his
aggressiveness, however, making many
enemies. In the older reports of the Su
preme Court there are numerous records
of his cases, in many of which his bristling
shafts of attack are directed at Judges and
other officers of authority.
In ISB3, after a career at law filled with
conditions, successes, reverses, wealth and
almost poverty, this strange man betook
himself to Nevada and began the always
fascinating senrch for precious ore. Three
years later his old friend and tutor, Judge
Huse, was committed to the Napu asylum
and there kept until about two years ago,
when he was transferred to the new insti
tution at Highlands. At Napa Gallardo
once secured his release, but he was soon re
turned there. It is alleged that Mr. Huse's
original incarceration at Napa, and his
subsequent confinement after being re
leased, were made without the examina
tion required by law; that his absence
from Santa Barbara County, in which he
owned some twenty-two leagues of land,
was thus enforced to permit of the undis
turbed working of a conspiracy to gain pos
session of his property, which plan was
successfully carried out. These are the
allegations made oy Mr. Gallardo, who as
serts emphatically that Judge Huse is not
now, nor was at the time of his original
commitment, in the least insane. Dr.
Holiister, after ten minutes' conversation
with him, also pronounced him of sound
minti.
Whether Mr. Gallardo's assertions are
true or imagined, Judge Huse is to-day
an impoverished man, nothing of the
princely domain once in his name remain
ing except part of a lot in Santa Barbara.
Hia faithful friend and pupil, however, has
never forgotten him, and half of the many
mining claims in his possession are deeded
to Mr. Huse.
The long delay in commencing proceed
THE SAN FRANCISCO CA.LL, SUNDAY, MAY 10, 189 G.
ings to liberate his friend was caused by
ill health and consequent adverse financial
circumstances. Three times has Mr. Gal
lardo been stricken with paralysis during
Judge Huse's confinement, each attack
disabling him for many months. The last
of these strokes, as usual, was wry severe,
and it was less than a year ago that he re
covered from the effects of it. At last,
blessed with reasonably good health, he
mounted his bay horse, which transports
him in all his travels, and, seated on a
sack of straw, S9t out for the scene of his
friend's incarceration. The trip, as a
matter of course, was an arduous one for a
man over three-score years, but the in
domitable attributes of his character served
to bear him through without apparent
distress, or even fatigue.
Wrapped in a long, dirty cloth Gallardo
carries' a roll of manuscript, the writing
upon which is executed in an exceedingly
small hand. "When at leisure he adds
thoughtfully to its contents with pen and
ink. It may be his diary, it may be his
history, it may contain information of rich
mines", or it may be a carefully prepared
statement of the case of Judge "H use. At
any rate it is his secret as far as his ac
quaintances in Santa Ana are concerned.
While here Mr. Gallardo dropped some
information which has a more local inter
est than the now celebrated asylum case.
He claims to hold a deed to the original
half interest of Maria Yorbade Burrnell,
daughter of Theodocia Yorba, in the
Rancbo Santiago de Santa Ana, which
covers a large portion of Orange County.
This deed he claims to have acquired in
1567, and asserts that he has never waived
any of his vested rights therein. The title
to the ranch was not confirmed by the Su
preme Court until 1884. Prior to that time
a suit in partition of the estate was
brought before Judge Morrison at Los
Angeles, but Gallardo refused to be a
party to it, claiming that the Judge had
no authority to pass upon matters re luting
to establishing titles to the land while the
Supreme Court had not yet rendered its
decision. Mr. Gallardo says he has no
fears of the statute of limitation, which
would have rendered his title void long
a o, but expresses his determination to
bring suit in the United State- Circuit
Court at Carson, Nev., to obtain possession

of the land, embracing some 5000 acres, to
which lie lays claim under his deed.
Whether this man is successful either in
liberating his old friend or acquiring pos
session of a tract of valuable land long
since divided up into prosperous farming
regions he at least has entertained those
with whom he i as come in contact in
Southern California and earned the dis
unction of being the strangest character
who has held their attention for many
years. Few who have met him will ever
forget his quaint, unkempt appearance, his
earnest and magnetic eloquence as he dis
courses upon the subjects which now seem
to be his sole ambitions, or his intelligent
old countenance as it lights up with the
fires of hope and determination, and un
less he succeeds in opening the title to the
large ranch, to a portion of which he lays
his antiquated claim, the acquaintances he
has formed in Orange County will have no
cause to recall hiw presence with any buta
feeling of pleasure and interest.

THE STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY.
Correspondence That Throws New Light
on the Remarkable Huge Case.
During the latter part of March, on learn
ing through the newspapers that Judge
Huse had taken legal steps in the Superior
Court of San Bernardino to secure his re
lease from the asylum, and having had no
communication with him for nine years
and desiring to make a simple test of his
present condition, I sent him in care of the
Medical Director of the Southern Cali
fornia Asylum a copy of The Call con
taining one of my "letters from the peo
ple," and also a copy of an lowa news
paper which had published one of my Call
letters, and in response I received from
Dr. Campbell a brief letter, in which he
says under March 30: "The papers sent by
you to Judge Huse will be given him. He
is in the same condition as when received
from Napa. The Judge is still quite enter
taining and bright in many ways, but is
thoroughly insane." On the 9ih of April
I received the following letter addressed to
me from the asylum at San Bernardino:
Dear Sir: I inclose a letter from Judge Huse
to you. In mv letter of March 30 to you I
stafed that Gallardo would probably swear out
another writ to obtain the release of Judge
Huse. This he has done. The Oftse was on
trial for three days, CJallardo and the Judge
amusing [eonsumiSftf] a f;ood deal of the
time. It has been postponed until the 14th
inst. Gallardo stated that he can get testi
mony from San Francisco to show that Judge
Huse was illegally committed and was not
insane, and I think Gallardo named you
as one upon whom he could depend for
such testimony. It is a very unfortunate
Btateof affairs that the Judae has not some
near relatives at hand who could assume con
trol of this case and by some means prevent
ddllardo from continuing his efforts to obtain
the Judge's release. I should bo more than
pleased to discharge or parole him in the care
of his relatives, provided they would assume
the burden. It has placed us in an unenviable
light temporarily, but could not be avoided,
as it would have been criminal on my part to
have discharged the man or paroled him into
the hands of a stranger whom I do not believe
to be qualified to look after him or to have any
legal right to assume the responsibility.
1 hope San Francisco papers will give the
outcome as much notice as they have the pro
ceedings up to date. Yours truly,
M B. Campbell. Medical Director.
It will be noted that the foregoing letter
is dated April 7, while the following letter
from Judge Huse, inclosed with Dr.
Campbell's letter, is dated April 1, show
ing that it was detained a week at the
asylum; and the reader will also bear in
mind tbat this letter from Judge Huse is
in response to the newspaper articles to
which my name was signed, which were
sent to him to see if lie would be able to
identify me and would write to me, and
also to see if he was familiar with the pres
ent state of National affairs and had any
interest in the political situation. Judge
of my astonishment and delight when 1
read in his well-known hand what here
follows, the manner of abbreviating my
middle name being exactly the same as
he had always adopted, the punctuation,
capitals, etc." being given as written:
San Bebnakdino, Cal., April 1, 1896.
Joseph A. Johnson, San FranctMO, Cal.â My
Estebmxd FBIKKO: Day before yesterday (Mon
dny last j.ast) I received two newspapers from
you, one oi which, the lowa (some one
took this newspaper from me, and I do not
recollect its heading), contained au article on
Trusts, corporations, combines, <fee., in which
you conclusively demonstrated that the I'ro
ancei has received, in diminished ratio, less
and less during the past ten reals; and the
Capitalist, during the same time, more and
more, thus absorbing, like a huge sponge, the
greater part oi the proceedsol the producer's
labor; tukiug as the data for your calculation
:lie ligures published in the United States
Census returns.
No man can successfully assail the conclu
sions resulting from your prMmses. The
whole article is logically sound and unanswer
able. It ought to be copied i:no other news
papers all over the country, that the masses of
the people may be enlightened and made to
sec and understand the true relations between
Labor and Capital, and become enabled to
adopt such legislative measures as to bridle
the greed of Avarice and Usury, Trusts, Corpo
rations, Combines and other unscrupulous
unions of wealth to the impoverishment of the
Producer, the Wage-earner, the Warp and Woof
of the Social Fabric. Otherwise, d!<>o.l may Bow
in torrents in this boasted land of Liberty. I
thank you for sending me the newspaper'con
taining your article.
And now I want to tell you how it occurred
that I was forcibly seized and taken from your
dwelling-house and carried back to Napa, I
was at your houÂ«e just one month, from th'j
24th day of March till the 'J4th of April, 1887.

Having my own misgivings as to the
animus of the asylum authorities, as indi

guarded note to him, as follows:

waited so long that you can be patient a little
longer. If possible 1 would come to you ou the
next train. Excuse this little letter when mv
heart demands twenty pages in which to speak
to you. As ever yours,
J. A. Johnson.
Here follows the letter to Dr. Campbell,
under date of April 10:
My Dear Sir: I am indebted to yon for two
courteous letters, giving me some details in
regard to the cage of Judge Charles E. Huse.
In reply, 1 desire to impress you with my pro
found regard for him and my most earnest
desire to serve him in the most devoted and
unqualified manner possible, for 1 was more
intimately associated v ith him in Sonta Bar
bara from 18H9 to 1870 than I have been
before or since with any other man; and
during all that long period a day seldom
passed, unless one or the other happened to
be absent from the place, that we did not meet
and in the most confidential and informal
manner discuss al' matters of interest to
either of us, from the affairs of the Nation to
our own private and domestic concerns; for I
think men rarely meet who find themselves
more congenial to each other, with more
tastes, ambitious, hopes and aspirations in
common than we always had, there being no
clash that I can now recall in our views it
sense of duly, except once in a minor political
matter of a local and transient character.
In all those years, Dr. Campbell, I found
Judge Huse the most gentle, patient, generous.
modest, faithful, unselfish, public-spirited,
self-reliant, stable-minded and studious man I
have ever known. He seemed deficient in only
one quality which appears to be requisite iii
our uay to ii complete, rounded and siici essful
man, namely, a lack of self-assertion and
aggressiveness. His love of peace ami dread of
strife would have made him a moral coward
but for an almost abnormal conscience, which
never permitted him to falter for a moment in
the discharge of any duty, however irksome or
distasteful it might prove to be.
His sense of honor, li is unyielding integrity,
his alert conscience and his chivalrous love of
fair play made it impossible for him to shirk
responsibility, resort to diplomacy or yield to
the sugg"stions of policy, and with the aver
age man of mixed motives and pliant con-
SOlence he never got on well, was usually mis
understood and misinterpreted, and hence he
never became popular with politicians and
schemers. While a deeply spiritual and devout
man. his broad and generous nature made him
one of the most toierant of men toward all
faiths and aspirations which tend to make for
righteousness and a pure life. Altruism in
spired and molded his character.
Bucb a man, thus imperfectly characterized,
was Charles K. Huge as I knew him, loved him
and honored him all those years from 1 Sii! Â» to
1876. On leaving Santa Barbara in 187(3, it
was understood and ngreed between us that
the separation should not be for long. He was
to close up his affairs there, and we were to
settle in Oakland. But as his Dtopefiy was in
real estate and bs dull times reduced price*
and made sales difficult, he held on, and in
the meantime he met with some reverses and 1

â¢ Asylum Nearly Sixteen Years Ago.
[From a photograph.]
encountered perplexing difficulties which
thwarted his purposes, and after a time I
learned to my utter consternation that he was
in the Napa Asylum for the Insane.
As he states in his letter which you have in
closed to me. after a detention of three months
he was discharged from the asylum and came
at once to my home here in San Francisco. We
wire both i n" need of money and he was greatly
exercised because he could not at once raise a
considerable sum on a portion of his propeity.
In all other respects he was cheerful and ra
tional as ever, with only an occasional and
momentary but utterly harmless hallucina
tion to indicate any inck of mental equilibrium
whatever; and these infrequent manifesta
tions never occurred except when some vexa
tious subject was under consideration. I am
unable to say just how he was sent back to the
asylum, as I waa away from home. On my re
turn I was told that he became violent, a po
liceman in called and he was taken away.
I have little more to add. 1 kept up a cor
respondence wltfa Dt. Doxler Of Napa for sev
eral years ns to the situation of Judge Huse,
his reports bttnsj uniformly unfavorable, and
the last one assured me that there was no hope
of the Judge's recovery. I now own to you
with sorrow and mortilication that I did not
continue my inquiries. His only daughter
lives tn Boston. She is able to care for her
father and I oannoi doubt her willingness to
do so. Hut I will conclude by appealing to you
to let Judge Huse go -forth on parole, once
more to enjoy his liberty under the care of his
faithful friend Gallardo, who may not have
the means to provide for him, but who
has what used to be considered of more
worth than wealth, the rare quality of
fidelity to a iriend in dire misfortune. If you
are riiiht in feeling that you ought to retain
him, it will uot be long before you will have
ample proof tÂ« justify you in recalling him to
the asylum. His letter to me clearly demon
strated that there are few so-called sane men
who are his equals in sanity and intelligence.
Put aside all technical questions as to how he
was committed or why, and forget for the time
that you are an honored officer of the State,
and consider rs a man how highly you prize
your own liberty. Yours, very truly,
JOSEI'H ASBVRY JOHNSON.
While I do not charge the asylum man
agement with intent to defeat Judge Huse
in his great eftort to secure the necessary
proofs to show that he had large posses
sions in land, both in Santa Barbara and
Ventura counties, to refute the chief claim
of the medical director, Dr. Campbell, that
Hu.-e was insane, because he had a fixed
delusion that he ha:l large landed prop
erties; yet the following letter from Huse.
written April 10, was not mailed from
the asylum, where it lay in the custody
of Dr. Campbell until the 18th, eight days,
while its contents will show that such de
lay worked a serious disadvantage to
Huse, who expected an immediate answer.
And I give the letter verbatim to show
exactly the style and manner of the man,
who now writes in reply to my brief letter
to him:
San Bernardino. Cal., April 10, 1896.

knowledge of the existence of the letter,
which was delivered at my house on Mon
day, the 20th, and immediately remailed
to me at San Bernardino, where I received
it when it was impossible for me to supply
the proofs named in the letter. This let
ter was put in evidence by me as a wit
ness after I had shown it to Dr. Campbell
as a witness and asked him for an explana
tion, which was to the effect that lie was
away from the asylum for a day or two
and he was sorry that it had been delayed.
He made a similar explanation as to the
delay of six days in the mailing of the
first letter of April 1.
On the morning of the 23d, at 10 o'clock,
1 met Judge Huse at the Courthouse, and
he at once recognized me in a very hearty
manner. We were given an opportunity
to converse together on the steps of the
Courthouse for three-quarters of an hour,
and when called to the witness-stand, in
response to a question by the court, I testi
fied that had 1 closed my eves anÂ«l made
allowance for the loss of Judge Huse's
teeth, which gave his words a muffled
sound, I could not have recognized any
difference in the Hus â¢ of 1876 and 1896. so
far as the tenor and substance of his talk
were concerned ; that he had greatly
changed in appearance from an erect and
alert man to a bent old man, unkempt, ill
dressed, and his manner wholly changed
by the loss of his glasses, as he is ex
tremely near-sighted, not being able to
distinguish a friend's features two or three
yards away.
Tue trial lasted three days, and I was
called to the stand as a witness each day,
my testimony mainly relating to Judge
Huse's leading characteristics as a lawyer
and as a man, and to his property inter
ests, including his contention with squat
ters and others who sought to dispossess
him of his property, more particularly of
the great rancho known as the "Los
Prietos y Nujalayeirua." In summing up
the caÂ«e and rendering a decision, which
occupied an hour. Judge Otis stated that
he hail never experienced more difficulty
in reaching a decision in any case, and in
remand'ng Judge Huse to the asylum it
was rather to secure for him the proper
care which he needed on account of cer
tain harmless hallucinations and personal
peculiarities and habits which might be
the result of his continuous confinement
for so many years and in constant associa
tion with inmates who are unquestionably
insane.
If it had been shown to the court during
the trial that any competent person stood
ready to care for the petitioner (Huse)
and render him such attention and ser
vice as it was certain, from the testimony
adduced and not contradicted, he at times
would be sure to need, there would be no
valid objection to granting his petition to
be released from further restraint. In
giving the substance in brief of the deci
sion the local daily newspaper, the Times-
Index, closes the report in these words:
"At the same time Judge Otis stated that
he had rarely seen, in court or elsewhere,
such a remarkable memory and evidences
of strong mentality, and that few attor
neys at the bar were able to conduct an
examination with more ability or to state
a legal proposition more clearly."
in consultation with Judire Otis in his
chambers, after ihe decision and the court
had adjourned, he urged upon me the pro
priety of taking steps at once to secure the
appointment of a suitable guardian for
Judge Huse and assured me that there
would then be no obstacle to prevent his
release from the asylum. In several con
versations which I had with Dr. Campbell,
in charge of the asylum, he gave me un
qualified assurance that he would have no
hesitation in releasing Judge Huse in the
care of a guardian who could and would
take proper care of him. It has been my
privilege for many years to have pleasant
relations with Judges of our State Su
preme Court, and I desire to say
here that I know of no one of them
in twenty years who was or is the supe
rior, in judicial temper, legal attainments,
mental balance, logical acumen, power
and clearness of statement of Judge Otis
of the Superior Court in San Bernardino,
or who is held in higher esteem by the
community in which he resides.
I will close by saying that in a private
interview with Judge Huse, with no one
in attendance, I became thoroughly satis
fied that he should not be discharged until
he has a proper guardian to care for him ;
but Ido think he should be released as
soon as possible in charge of such a guar
dian, and that it would be a crime to de
tain him when such guardian can be se
cured. Joseph Asbury Johnson.
MINNIE, A NEW JERSEY CAT.
Trouble Made by Her Prejudice Against
Singing and Loud Preaching,
When Minnie was born no one in the
household could see that she gave promise
of being unlike other cats. Her mother
was a tabby cat of graceful form and af
fectionate disposition, but not remarkable
in any other way. Minnie was a tabby,
too, and, like her mother, of small and
narrow build. She soon developed a
strong affection for the daughter of the
tamily, a girl of 12 years, named Lucy.
When Lucy was at home she and Minnie
were constant companions. Minnie usually
took regular open-air exercise, but she was
sure to be by Lucy's side when Lucy was
ready for school and to accompany her as
far as the garden gate.
Then she would leap to the top of one of
the gate posts and watch until her mis
tress got out of sight. vVhen Lucy came
home Minnie never failed to meet her at
the street corner and accompany her back
to the house, capering about her feet, or
sometimes springing up to her shoulders.
Lucy had to do a great amount of prac
ticing at the piano. Minnie would sit upon
a chair near by and blink with apparent
appreciation all through the preliminary
practice of scaies and finger exercises.
When these were over and the etudes were
begun she would arouse herself and climb
to Lucy's shoulder, where she would
remain, occasionally rubbing her cold
nose lovingly against Lucy's cheek. As
soon as the practicing of pieces began she
would spring over to the top of the piano
and seat herself. At times, when the
rnasic especially appealed to her, she
would glide down to the keyboard and
with one of her little forepaws strike two
or three notes in succession and look up
into Lucy's face as if she would say, "You
see, 1 can do it, too." Then she would
resume her place on the piano cover and
remain until the hours for practice were
over.
Thus the music lessons passed for many
days, but on one eventful day Lucy began
to sing. Minnie's hair rose on end. She
lashed her tail from side to side, and in
blind fury she chased round and round the
piano top until she seemed to spin. Lucy
stopped singing.
Minnie quieted down and jumped into
her lap for caresses and consolation.
Presently Lucy resumed the sineing. Then
Minnie gave voice to her feelings. She
howled and wailed until the whole family
â mother, auntie, grandmother and the
boys â came to see what was the matter.
Nobody ever tried to practice singing in
Minnie's presence again.
Minnie was as good about the house as
a watchdog, starting at a strange step or a
noise, and a ring at the door bell would
take her at once to the door, where she
would stand and growl and spit until she
was assured that all was right.
One Sunday evening Lucy and her
mother and aunt started for the Methodist
church at the far end of the big New Jer
sey city where they live. Alter going a
considerable distance they discovered that
Minnie also was a member of the party.
She often followed them about the streets
near home, but as she wrfs not wanted that
night, they took pains to see that she was
bent back. When she was out of sight
they went on. They reached the church
and took seats. The service besan.
Then, to the horror of the party, Minnie
slowly walked forth from their pew, passed
up the aisle and took a seat upon the altar
rail facing the congregation. She sat blink
ing at the people. The preacher arose and
announced his text. Pretty soon he grew
excited, shouted his words "ol warning and
pounded nis desk in old-time Methodist
style. Minnie, too, grew excited. She be
gan walKine back and forth along the altar
rail. As the preacher became more .and
more vigorous in his language and gesticu
lations her tail swelled and she lashed it
back and forth. Finally she burst forth
with howls and wails which drowned the
preacher's voice.
A deacon came to the rescue of the
preacher and tbe service. How he secured
Minnie and what he did with her Lucy
does not know, for she was too frightened
to look; but when she and her mother and
aunt reached home after the service Min
nie met them at the corner as if nothing
unusual had happened.â New York Sun.
BOTANICAL CURIOSITY,
It Is a Most Unusual Growth
of a Eucalyptus Tree.
About the most grotesque tree to be
found in California is one growing on a
ranch near Warm Springs. It is an or
dinary specimen of the eucalyptus variety
and was planted about ten years ago along
with a lot of others, it being the owner's
| intention to make them serve as a wind
break.
For some mysterious reason all died ex
cept one, and that has, as the farmers say,
"all gone to stalk." At first this tree
made a very slow growth, but did not at-

tract attention as anything unusual. It
showed no disposition to be anything but
a sapling. It gradually grew higher and
higher and never put out branches except
at the top.
The tree is now nearly ninety feet high
and all there is to it is a pole of a trunk
with a bunch of sickly looking leaves at
the tip end.
It is much higher than trees of this
species generally, and the straightness of
the trunk is also remarkable. The bark of
the tree is as it should be, and so is the
wood. The conditions of the locality
where the tree i 8 planted seemed particu
larly adapted to it, so no reason can be
given for its growing as it does.
This tree can be seen for miles around,
as it rears its bunch of leaves high above
the level country. It is of no earthly use
and certainly cannot be considered an or
nament, but the owner of the ranch lets it
grow as a curiosity, and says there is no
telling what it will eventually turn into.
Musical Item.
The minister. Parson Downyconch, was
at dinner with the Chaffie family. Johnnie
spoke up and said:
"Can a church whistle?"
"Why do you ask, Johnnie?" asked the
clergyman kindly.
"Because pa owes $12 back pew rent,
and he says he is going to let the church
whistle."
After the clergyman had taken his de
parture there was a vocal solo by Johnnie.

SOCIETY
WEDDINGS and engagements 1
have been the only topic of I
interest in social circles dur
ing the past week.
The engagement of Miss j
Delmas, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. D. M. j
Pelmas, and Lionel Fitzgerald-Kennv, tel- I
t-fjraphed from London the other day, was
a delight as well as a great surprise to the j
many f;iends of the young lady in this i
City.
Miss Delruas is the youngest daughter of !
P. M. Delmas, the attorney, and a grand- j
daughter of the late Judge Joseph S. Hose, |
who died in this City a few years ago. Her
eldest sister is the wife of William S.
Barnes, the District Attorney of San Fran
cisco. Mrs. Delmas and her two Uaugh- j
ters, Miss Antoinette Delmas and Miss J
Josephine Delmas, left a little over a year j
ago for Europe.
The ladies had been living very quietly
in Paris, with occasional trips to Italy and
the south of France. It was while tour
ing Italy that they made the acquaintance
of Miss Kenny, sister of the harpy groom, j
Mr. Kenny was first introduced to Miss
Delmas in Paris.
The groom's family is one of the oldest
in Ireland. The original Hugh de Nugent
went to Ireland es the Baron of Delvin in
1215. In 14fXj a descendant was com
mander of the forces in Ireland as Lord
Delvin. In 1681, Richard, the fifteenth
Baron, was created an Earl. The mem
bers of the family were all prominent in
the army and on the bench during the
past two centuries. The present Earl of
Westmeatk was Baron in IS7O. He has ?
two brothers and four sisters living. He
is the eleventh Earl. His brother William >
was born in 1871, and his brother Gilbert in !
1880. His eldest sister was barn in 1866.
Lionel Fitzgerald-Kenr.y is a direct i
descendant by a younger son of the eighth !
Earl, William Thomaa Nugent, who was j
also known as Lord Riverston. The mother j
of the groom died in 1879.
During their stay in Paris the Misses Del
mas have been devoting much of their time j
to the study of languages and to literature, j
Visiting the various art galleries has been j
for them a source of constant delight as !
both young ladies have most artistic capa- ]
bilities.
The wedding will take place in a London j
church on Thursday, the 21st inst., and will !
be a quiet affair, only the relatives of the â 
two families being present at the cere- ,
mony. The young couple will then make '
a tour of the Continent. They will reside j
on the estate of the husband in Ireland. |
Mrs. Delmas and Miss Delmas will pre- i
sumably remain another year in Europe be- i
fore their return to California.
The other engagement which has not
only interested but astonished the world j
of society is that ot Miss Isaoel McKenna !
and Peter Donahue Martin. The young |
couple have been engaged for the paÂ«t !
month, and it wa3 not intended to an- j
nouuee the betrothal to the friends until i
the 25th, the date of Mr. Martin's return
from the south, but it inadvertently be
came public.
The young lady who is to be the bride of
Mr. Martin is the eldest daughter of the
Hon. Joseph McKenna, Judge of the
United States Circuit Court of this City.
When her parents left Solano County for
Washington, D. C, where Judge McKenna
served four terms as Congressman, Miss
McKenna accompanied them, and entered
the convent at Georgetown, where she
graduated with honors, the first of the
class of ".ft.
When her father was appointed Judge of
the United States Circuit Court by Presi
dent Harrison the family moved to San
Francisco, and Miss McKenna made her
formal debut in society here. She soon be
came a great favorite with the younger
society set, and was prominent at all social
gatherings.
Miss McKenna has long enjoyed the
reputation of being one of the beauties of
the younger set. Tall and slender, with
patrician features, she certainly deserves
her well-merited succees.
In addition to her many charming per
sonal traits, Miss McKenna has rare men
tal attainments. She is one of the best
read of all the society girls, and the honors
that she bo deservedly won in college she
has maintained in her brilliant social
career.
Miss McKenna made her debut in so
ciety three months ago at a small tea
given by her parents at their residence on
Franklin street. The young debutante
â¢was an immediate success. Her charm
ing manners, especially her low, sweet,
well-modulated voice, endeared her to all
who met her, and no entertainment was
considered complete without her presence.
Peter Donahuo Martin, the happy man,
is the eldest son of Mr 3. Eleanor Martin
and of the late Edward Martin, one of the
early pioneers of California, who died
several years ago a multi-millionaire. He
is also the nephew of the late Peter Dona
hue and of the late ex-Governor Downey
of Los Angeles.
Mr. Martin received his early education
in California, and then went to the George
town College, near Washington, D. C,
where he graduated a few years ago, and
then returned to thia coast to take active
charge of the estates of his father and
uncle, Governor Downey.
He is at present in the south, where he
manages the Downey estate, with head
quarters at Los Angeles. He also has a
large undivided interest in the Steams
ranch, and manages that large tract of
land, as well as rhe Warner ranch, sitn
aÂ»ed in San Diego County, near the Mexi
can line, and embracing hundreds of
thousands of acres. At present he is at
the Warner ranch with his younger
brother, where he went a week ago.
With all his close attention to business
lie has been quite a favorite in society
circles in this City. He is a member of
the University and Burlingame clubs, and
uikcs an active part in outdoor exercises.
He has played in several poio games, is a
good tennis-player, and has been promi
nent in the gatherings of the Friday-night
Cotillon Club and other society functions.
The date has not yet been set for the
weddinz, but it is stated that it will be
celebrated early in the summer.
Although the wedding of Miss Hannah
Williams and Walter Scott Hobart is to
be an extremely quiet affair, and the
guests who will witness the ceremony
have been limited to twenty-eight in all,
including the family, interest in the nup
tials of the charming young couple is un
limited, and the community at large unites
in wishing them ail possible joy. The
Williams cottage at Fan Rafael, where the
wedding is to be celebrated, is an ideal
home for a marriage. Honeysuckles and
fragrant, climbing roses almost conceal
the outward architecture and nil the home,
with its hospitable open doors and case
ments, with a delicious fragrance.
The wedding is to be solemnized in the
family *6itting-room, a handsome apart
ment with artistic, old-fashioned furnish
ing. The decorations, as far as consistent,
are to be ail in pink.
Bishop Nicuois, assisted by Rev. M.
hartman of St. Paul's, San Rafael, is to
perform the ceremony. Robert E. Neil,
Grandfather of the bride, will give her
into the keeping of the happy young
groom.
After the ceremony there is to be a
bridal breakfast, at which covers will be
laid for twenty-eig'.it.
The guests will include, besides the im
mediate members of the high contracting
families, Miss Mary Eyre, Miss Bertha
Smith, Miss Alice Hoffman, Miss Harriet
Allen of Ross Valley, Dr. Tevis, William
laylor, Fred McNear, Brigadier-General
Forsytb, Dennison Forsyth and Minister
Willis and Mrs. Willis.
As may readily be imagined the bridal
trousseau is elegant and magnificent.
Madame Lowenberger was selected to make
the bridal gown and the bridesmaids'
Presses and has achieved the greatest suc
cess.
The bridal gown is of cream-white satin.
The jupe is en train and perfectly plain.
The "balayeuse" consists of five "flounces
Df old Duchesse. The corsage is cut high.
The back is without a seam ond the front
of the bodice as weil as the small modish
sleeves veiled with a fleecy mesh of tulle.
An escharp of duchesse, falling in points
over the sleeves and ending at the waist,
is the only adornment of the gown, which
is characterized by its elegant simplicity.
Miss Hobart and Miss Williams, the
bridesmaids, will be attired alike in pink
silk gowns, with white swiss overdresses.
The slips are made of pink silkâ the shade
of the sea shellâ and perfectly plain. The
overdresses are all tucked with tiny
pleats, all hand-made, that have kept ten
girls busy from early mora till late at
night during the past week.
Between each eight tucks there is an
insertion of Valenciennes and a flounce of
the same dainty lace finishes off the hem.
A pink silk cash will be worn round the
waist.
The bride's going-away dress will be a
tailor gown, with a rough blue straw hat
to match.

HIS BROKEN PROMISES,
How the Quarrel Between
Cleveland and Hendricks
Originated.
The President Failed to Carry Out
Agreements Made When He Was
bat a Candidate.
"But can Thomas afford to accept?"
Mrs. Thomas A. Hendricks asked me
when I read a telegram to her announcing
the nomination of Mr. Hendricks for Vice-
President on the ticket with Grover Cleve
land. Indiana Democracy had been wild
with excitement for months in anticipa
tion of the nomination of Hendricks for
President. Cleveland and others had been
mentioned, but the Democrats of the
Hooaier State knew but one man in all
America who was fit, worthy and entitled
to be the National party's standard-bearer,
and when the second place was given to
their favorite, in the bitterness of their
disappointment they asked as did Mrs.
Hendricks, "Can Thomas afford to ac
cept?"
This was in 1884 when Grover Cleveland
gave the old leaders an exhibition for the
firrt time of his consummate skill as a
political mixer and manipulator. That he
was adroit on that occasion there is no
doubt whatever, but then he has
been adroit enough on every oc
casion since that capture of the party
to do about as he liked and I have
watched with considerable interest his
methods. Cleveland is not the stubborn
and self-willed politician that some sup
pose him to be, but he is all that and a
good deal more when wearing the robes of
office. The immense majority, nearly
200,000, he received when elected Governor
of New York was misunderstood by him.
Inste ad of understanding it as a rebuke to
the Republican ring he looked upon it as
an expression of the confidence of the
people in himself, such as no other man
ever received, and it so turned his head
that he soon came to the conclusion that
Providence had sent him into the world
to rule mankind and that mankind could
not get on without him, but that did not
binder him from studying the ins and outs
of practical politics, nor to overlook the
sleek methods of Tammany.
But this is a digression, although it
serves to lead tip to revelations of the
man's true character. Mr. Heiuiricks. who
was himself a thorough, but an honest,
politician, made an analysis of Cleveland's
methods to capture the nomination for
President, which convinced him that for
his own good he had better have an under
standing with the head of the ticket be
fore accepting second place. Pressure was
at once brought to bear upon Mr. Hen
dricks to accept, for, it was urged, he
would have to pull the ticket through, if
it ever got through. But the wily old
Indianian said to tnern all, "Give me time
j to think it over." Upon his return from
the Chicago convention I called at his
! residence at Indianapolis, and when I
1 asked when we might expect his letter of
acceptance, "I will tell you," he said, "but,
as they say, 'not for publication.' I do
not know that I shall accept at all; any
way, not until I have had a clear, positive
and certain understanding with Mr. Cleve
land."
"That is an unusual procedure, is it
; not," I said.
"Perhaps so," Mr. Hendricks replied,
"but I have never met Governor Cleveland.
Some of the' New York delegates to the
convention know him quite well, however,
and after listening to recitals of their ex
periences with him I concluded the wiser
course for me would be to have a confer
ence with him before agreeing to run for
Vice-President."
"Of course," I said, "if you have a con
ference there would be no danger of a con
flict of opinion and policy between your
letters of acceptance."
"I am not thinking of that at all," he re
plied, "but I shall not accept the nomina
tion until Governor Cleveland gives me
satisfying assurances that, if elected, the
Vice-President will not be a mere fifth
wheel to a wagon. The office of Vice-
President must be elevated to where its
incumbent will not only be the principal
official confidant and adviser of the Presi
dent, but he must be substantially on a
parity with the President in the matter of
patronage, and also there must be less dis
tinction than heretofore in a social way
between the President and Vice-Presi
dent."
Being enjoined to necrecy, of course 1
did not "give it away" to the newspaper I
represented, but I awaited with interest
Mr. Hendricks' return from his conference
with Cleveland. Meanwhile the pressure
that was being brought to bear upon Mr.
Hendricks to promptly accept was becom
ing almost too gr at for a human being to
bear. The "boys" wanted to go to work,
but until Hendricks accepted there could
be nothing to enthuse about.
When it suited his convenience Mr.

LOSE MILLIONS.
Tobacco Manufacturers Out
$10,000,000 in '95.
Prospect of Still Larger Loss in '90.
Great Anxiety in Tobacco Circles.
CHICAGO, 111., May B.â it was reported here
to-day that a large sum oi money had been of-
fered for the tobacco habit cure No-To-Bac
famous all over the country for Its wonderful
cures. This offer, it is said, was made by par-
ties who desire to take it off the market and
stop the sale, because of its injury to the to-
bacco business. General Manager Kramer of
>o-To-Bac, when interviewed at his office 45
Randolph street, said:
v "No, sir. No-To-Bac is not for sale to the to-
bacco trust. Certainly No-TcÃac affects the
tobacco business. It will cure over 200 000
people in 1896, at an average savin? of $50
which each would otherwise expend for to-
bacco, amounting in round figures to $10,000,-
000, Of course, tobacco dealers' loss is gained
by M th ! cured ', Do Â£l Ko-To-Bac â  benefit physi-
cally .' "i es, sir. The majority of our patients
report an immediate gain of flesh, and their
nicotine saturated systems are cleansed and
made vigorous. No-To-Bac is sold by druggists
throughout the United states and Canada,
I under absolute guarantee that three boxes will

j money back. Of course, there are failures, but

the good will of an occasional failure than the
i money. \\ c publish a little book called/Don't

| tells all about No-To-Bae, which will be"malled
I free to any one desiring it. Aadress the Ster-
lor New Yo k y " C Â°" Chlc * Montreal, Canada,
Hendricks journeyed down to meet Cleve
land, and a day or two later it was flashed
over the wires that "of course Mr. Hen
dricics would acceptâ that ho had never
had any other purpose, and that he and
Governor Cleveland were in perfect accord
as to policy and all else." I met Mr. Hen
dricks soon afterward, whan he told me
that Mr. Cleveland promptly and most
cheerfully conceded that his (Hendricks')
demands were not only reasonable and
right, but that they were entirely in har
mony with his own opinion of what rela
tion the Vice-President should sustain to
the Presidentâ "a kind of joint adminis
tration of the affairs of the country," as
Cleveland put ii.
It was not long after the inauguration of
Cleveland and HendricKs before hints be
gan to fall here ana there that the rela
tions between the distinguished gentlemen
were very much strained. To me this was
no surprise, for I knew certain of Hen
dricks' friends did not cct the positions
that were promised them, and not one of
them blamed the Vice-President. I never
believed for a moment that Cleveland in
tended to keep faith with Hendricks, and
so when I next met Mr. Hendricks, which
was in the following autumn, I made haste
to find out how matters stood between
himself and the President. "It would do no
good and might do much harm to publicly
air our differences," Mr. Hendricks said,
"but I will say for your own information,
but not for the public just now. anyway,
that Mr. Cleveland has repudiated every
promise he made at our interview when I
agreed to accept the nomination for Vice-
President. lam grieved at this revelation
of his character, most, however, because
he is sure to wreck the party sooner or
later."
"Do you mean," I asked, "that Mr.
Cleveland is already planning tor a second
term?"
"Yes, and not only for a second but a
third and as many more as he can get.
Moreover I am satisfied that he was pre
paring'to get the machinery of the party
in hand for that purpose at the very time
he accepted my terms as the condition of
my candidacy for Vice-President. My
friends are beginning to understand that
it is no fault of mine when tbev are turned
down. But if my name helped in any way
to win the victory of November last surely
I am glad that I accepted the nomination,
for the party's good is the first considera
tion always, but for many other reasons I
regret very much that I uid not promptly
refuse to accept before leaving Chicago.
I think Mr. Cleveland's acts and interpre
tation of Democratic principles will do
great harm to the party."
1 had a suspicion at the time, and not
without good reason, that the agreement
between Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Hendricks
included a promise from the former that
the machinery of the party should be run
in the interest of the latter's candidacy
for the nomination for President by the
next convention, and the vehement man
ner of Mr. Hendricks when he told me of
Cleveland's ambition in that direction re
moved all doubt from my mind. I felt
confident that Mr. Hendricks agreed to
run for Vice-President and carry Indiana
for the ticket under a promise that he
should head the procession four years
later. Ana I may add that, in my opin
ion, it was his betrayal more than any
thing else that sent Mr. Hendricks to an
untimely grave. He was the soul of
honor, and to be betrayed by a friend was
too much for his great and good heart.
The cold-bloodedness of President Cleve
land's plan to break with the Vice-
President wounded Mr. Hendricks deeply,
for it was the dragging in of social and
personal matters in a way that was calcu
lated to establish intensely hostile relations
between Mr. Hendricks and several of the
leaders of the party in Indiana. Ex-United
States Senator McDonald and Mr. Hen*
dricks were good enough friends to work
together for the party's good, but there
was a bitter feud between Mrs. Hendricks'
"set" and Mrs. McDonald's "set," and
under no circumstances could they have
met upon common ground in Washing
ton's social life. All this was told to Cleve
land by a mischief-making friend, who
knew that it was just the wedge the Presi
dent was looking for. Mr. Cleveland had
his strikers give it out that he was ex
ceedingly anxious to give McDonald a high

position of some kind in the administra
tion, so that it could have the benefit of hii
own great ability as a jurist and statesman,
as well as the social influence of his
family. Now, Cleveland never intended
to give McDonald anything, but big
scheme worked so well that Indiana's
social and political worlds were thrown
into the wildest commotion. Naturally
Mr. Hendricks stood by his wife and her
"<jet," as did Mr. McDonald by his wife
and her "set." Then the personal frienda
and political following of Hendricks and
McDonald took sides, and right then and
there Mr. Hendricks' hopes for the nomi
nation of his party for President in 1883
were blasted, his power to control patron
age broken, Mr. McDonald was dropped
for good and all, and Cleveland was
supreme in the command of the Demo
cratic party.
The domestic life of "Thomas and
Eliza," as the intimate friends of Mr. and
Mrs. Hendrick3 were wont to call them,
was an ideal one. There was nothing in
their going and corning that had any rela
tion whatever to aristocracy, yet two more
polished people could not have been found
in America. They were very happy i t
their own companionship, but they were
exceedingly fond of the society of their
friends. This will, in some measure, give
a glimpse of their home Jifo when alone:
I called early one morning to say
good-by before leaving Indianapo i
and found Mr. Hendriclrs in his
shirtsleeves and "tied up" in a.
white apron helping his wife "to clear off
the breakfast table." "To what base uses
may not a Vice-President of the I
States at last come, madam?" I jot;
remarked. "Our girl," said Mrs. Hen
dricks, "was taken ill last night, and
Thomas is helping me with the kitchen
work, as you see." "I rather like it, be
sides it gives me more time to be with
Eliza tnesebusy political times," observed
Mr. Hendricks.
On leaving their house I met a lady, an
old friend of the Hendricks family, and I
related to hsr what I had just seen and
heard. "Yes," she said, "Thomas and
Eliza will always be lovers, and were he
crowned King and she Queen of America,
the simplicity of their home life wouiu
continue." Abmoud.
UPWARD TENDENCIES.
The Prices of Wine and Grapes Climb
ing Higher Very Rap
idly.
Wine experts say the outlook this year,
so far as prices are concerned, is more
promising than it has been for a decade.
In speaking on the subject, John
Wheeler, manager of the California Wine
makers' Corporation, said that the trend
of prices this year will carry them away
above expectations.
"You see," he said, "the figures are
these: The output last year was 9,000,000
gallons; this year it will be 4,500,000. The
annual exports for the last few years have
been 16,000,000 gallons, and the home con
sumption has been 6,000,000 gallons. This
gives a total of 22,000,000, but as this rep
resetits 4,000,000 gallons of sweet wines it
leaves the market demand for dry wines
at 10,000,000 gallons. Last year the wine
men were already drawing upon their ac
cumulated stock, and all they have now to
supply the demand is about 5,000,000 gal
lons.
"Grapes have taken a correspondingly
high range. At Glen Ellen and Bonoma
they are offering $30 a ton. In Napa Val
ley they are offering $25 and $30 a ton, but
there is not much of a crop there. In
other places grapes are proportionately
high."
Mr. Wheeler thinks the price of wine is
going over 25 cents a gallon within a short
time. Offers of 20 and 21 cents are already
being made.

OLD CURIOSTY SHOP.
late Colonel James L. L. F.
Warren had for years been plan
ning for the classification of his
X belongings, being desirous of put
ting beyond the perils of the auc
tion counter snch of them as were of rare
historical vaiue. He seemed quite hale
and hearty only a year ago when he in
formed a friend that "the very thought of
executors pawing around and hawking
bis collection to idle-minded sightseers
haunted him." But the colonel's object,
VIEW OF TUE INTERIOR OF COLONEL WARREN'S OLD CURIOSITY SHOP.
[Sketched by a "Call" arttit.]
in thi? respect, was never accomplished.
The idea of himself making a disposition
of his effects never got beyond the stage
of intention, and when he passed out of
the world of flesh some three weeks ago
his curios and his treasures cf literature
science and art were still scattered about
his veritable "old curiosit3'-shop" at 1004
Howard street, and the confused heaps of
his papers, books, magazines, pictures and
relics were almost bidden underneath the
undisturbed dust of months.
To-day the executors are performing the
laborious task that Colonel Warren laid
out for some historiographer, and the rich
mementos of old times that represent the
patient in-gathering of four score years
may soon be disposed of in the very man
ner that was invested with perils to
the mind of the pioneer â under the auc
tioneer's hammer.
Old Colonel Warren was a walking en
cyclopedia of information. He possessed
a splendid memory, and from the year
1815, when a mere child of 10. he continued
to collect and store papers and periodicals
that might become of value at a future
day. It is to be regretted that the Colonel
did not find time, in his later years, to
write a volume with reference to his col
lection, for much of the interesting history
of many of the relics was buried forever
when the man whose chief pride they were
was laid below the reaches of the sun.
Still, as you push or sidle your way
throueh that memory-haunted snop with
its wealth of old books, cases of relics and
mineralogical specimens, stacks of
albums, tiunka and boxes filled with his
tory-breathinc letters and manuscripts
and tokens from everywhere, and march
through a narrow aisle, upon each side of
which newspapers are piled from floor to
ceilingâ and when you are assured,
furthermore, that heaped up there out of
eight are complete files of leading papers
and magazines from the very beginning
of the century â you hardly feel that any
fuing is needed to inform you of their
value. The books and capers speak for
themselves, and the late owner had
labeled many of the relics with a careful
pen.
The executors are taking an inventory
of the contents of the shop, and it will be
weeks before they can possibly form an
estimate of the value of the collection.
It is rather a puzzle where to begin to
describe the mass of things in this long,
dark room. In the first glass case that !

years of age, was one of the guard of
ho:ior to the Frenchman who played so
glorious a part at the side of Washington.
And so that piece of the sbip Cadmus told
volumes to the eye of the nonagenarian.
A few stops further on is a work of art â
"Bunker Hill Monument" â made of rare
and beautiful shells, crystals and moss
agate. On the floor below it is a cannon
ball dug up by young Warren in 1823 on
the hillside where his immortal namesake
inspired the Continentals by flaming
words and flashing sword to deeds which
hewed a way for liberty.
Would you know something of interest
about the early history of agriculture in
California? The tall broom, with the very
lone brush, leaning against yonder case,
will tell you a little and give you a hint as
to where you may find more. The label
on it reads: "First broom made in Cali
fornia â 1852. Exhibited in Sacramento
at Warren's Agricultural Fair on
.1 street." In fact, Colonel Warren
held the first agricultural fair in
tne Golden State, and he has been
styled "the father of husbandry in Califor
nia." He is credited with having been the
foremost man at the dawn of statehood
here to call the attention of the general
Miblic to the desirability of cultivating the
soil and of seeking fortune by its tillage
rather than continue the crush to the
crowded mines. Herelies a box containing
sixty specimens, each in a little bottle by
itseif, of California native flower seeds,
packed in 1852 and 1853. A catalogue ac
companies the box. May not some spe
cialist in floriculture find value in these?
Might not these same seeds serve to ex-
Elain away a doubt as to some fact of a
owers nativity?
Over there in the corner, black with
dust, is a sack of flour of the first, ever
manufactured in California. It was made
by Warren himself in 1853.
Look around at the paintings on the
wall. Let us wipe away some of the dust.
Ah! there is an ancient painting by
Rudolf Wargitzky. Berlin, entitled "The
Piper and the Madonna.". It is excellently
well preserved. An oil painting of General
John A. Sutter, by one of the early Cali
fornia artists, occupies a prominent place.
It is said to be the finest likeness in ex
istence of that man whose name is so
indelibly associated with our pioneer
times. An oil portrait of the "good gray
poet." Walt Whitman, harms next to i[
and next to that aqainis a portrait of War I
ren, painted by W. C. Pratt at Boston in
1627.
Stacked up on a table is a pile of samples
of California woods prepared by Thomas
Hatch, woodworker. The samples em
brace the yellow pine, big-tree sequoia,
laurel, ash, fir, curly redwood, live and
white oak, maple, alder, white cedar,
shitam wood, camphor, pear, birc'i, ma-f
drone, sugar pine, sycamore, nutmeg,
plain redwood and walnut varieties.
Here is a set of carved ivory chessmen,
marvels of exquisite workmanship. A
slip of paper in the box informs the curi
ous that '"this is the best set of chessmen
on the Pacific Coast and it was purchased
from Samuel Bran nan, then of the firm o
Osborn & Brannan,on Montgomery street,
in 1849, and I paid $50 in gold lor* them."
The colonel valued highly an iron model
of the burial casket of Napoleon the Great,
purchased in Paris in 1847. It is made so
as to serve as an ink well.
Between the yeari 1820 and 1845 Colonel
Warren conducted the Nonatnum Vale
Gardens, at Brighton, Mass., and among
his effects is a visitor's record-book of that
resort, containing autographs of such
illustrious Americans as Webster, Clay,
Calhoun, Emerson, Longfellow, Brvant
and Elian Burritt.
Colonel Warren traveled in Europe with
Ole Bull when the latter was in his prime,
and about the shop are numerous pictures
and autographs of the great master of the
violin. At the bottom of one large like
ness of himself the musician wrote:
Homage to Colonel Warren, the father of
agriculture in California, the father of the
homeless, the father of his friends, the stanch
defender of liberty in the aits and sciences
and the protector of his admiring friend,
OLE BULU
San Francisco, March 4, 1870.
In the mountain of papers, above referred
to, the deceased only a year ago ventured
the opinion that there were nearly 2,000,000
of newspapers and periodicals. " Had the
colonel lived for another decade, the in
crease in his newspaper collection would
have crowded him out of doors.
A copy of the "California Silk-Growers'
Manual,' by Louis Prevost, pioneer silk
| cuiturist of the Paciiic Coast (1867), is
marked "very rare â price $25."
Stumbling over a coral tree from the
Solomon Islands, you run against a table
lull of rare books. There is a "Collection
of Church Music," by the Boston Handel
and Haydn Society, printed in 1823, and a
complete set of the British poetsâ well
bound and finely preserved, in fifty
volumesâ edited by Robert Walsh Jr., and
published by Samuel T. Bradford, Phila
delphia, iv iS22. Rare books abound on
the numerous shelves.
One of the rich mementos of famous
people is a large cnest made of a combina
tion of gold, silver and copper, and said to
have been the treasure 6afe of the great
Rolla of Peru.
The collections of old European and
American coins, and of stamps from nearly
nil nations, are extensive and valuable.
There is no telling, indeed, what a new
wealth of curios and relics may be dis
covered when the contents of the old shop
are thoroughly explored.
Toward the close of the colonel's life he
was constantly at his desk in the dusky
room during the daytime, uno at night he
reposed on a cot in a valley between his
mountains of papers. The old place was
more than a home to him. He lived there
among old friends and darling memories
and dreamed old dreams over and over
again. He prized everythine in tne shop,
even to the type with which he had long
ago printed the California Farmer. TÂ»e
colonel in his day had been hotel-keeper,
temperance lecturer, merchant, newspaper
editor and agriculturiot. At last his rela
tives forced him to leave his treasure
house in order that his life might be pro
longed in a more healthful atmosphere
and by a more regular mode of living.
He had to be carried out, and he made
those who gently bore him halt at the
doorway while he cast a iong, lingering,
reluctant, farewell look at his busts and
his birds and his pictures and dis books.
Then he said, "Let us go," and the vete
ran of 90 years was driven away â bis last
journey but one, the journey to the grave.
Ub
Yes, we propose to conduct our whist
articles to reach and assist the beeinneir
who will study a little. We also intend to
remain in shallow water, and not to wade
out "over our heads," which seems to be
the fashion with those that go into print
possessed with a smattering knowledge
of the game. It is the custom with many
whist writers to tell all about the "grand
coup," the "fourchette," the "echo of the
call," the "sub-echo" and other things
before they try to get their readers
out of their whist kilts. Like many others
that play at the game, in our own opinion
we knew more about whist before we ever
read or knew there was such a thing as a
book published on the game than we did
after ten years of hard study. For about
five years we have been a pupil of Miss Kate
Wbeelock, and if the little queen will per
mit us to be one of her loyal subjects five
years more we will continue to be one of
her pupils. Her judgment and knowledge
of the game is so great that no question in
whist ever comes up that we do not
suDmit the same to her royal highness
as well as other whist authorities and no
one is ever more willing than our queen to
help aloug tho^e who are trying to help
themselves. This much we have said in an
swer to letters received, asking if ourwnist
coiumn will continue, as it has started in,
to help those who are williug to study a
little.
""Whist" for April is just at hand.
Many things that are said in this num
ber will be food for the "lad" players.
The columns of Whist are open for writers
on the game from all schools, and just
now before the June congress takes place,
Whist is undoubtedly encouraging this
class of players to get them to show up in
full force at the congress, and prove by
their play that their different systeniÃ of
faHs have or have not . to stand on.
Iv the game just at the prabtdit time
there are a lot of players who arc beating
a ''ioin-tom," or playing on one string,
called the short-suit game. Every whist
player of the first rank knows there are
times when a hand demands the opening
of a short suit just as well as other hands
demand the opening of the long suit. It
is not possible for it to occur in the lifetime
of an individual that two deals in
whist were ever exactly alike, consequently
they are never played alike. Some three
years ago, in an article that appeared in
the Brooklyn Eagle on tne subject of how
to open the game and how your partner
should treat your original lead, we made
the following statement:
When the original leader opens a plain suit,
with both elements of strength declared, his
partner should put forth all his energies to es
tablish that suit immediately and briiitf it in
later, and not try to establish one in his own
band. In this case, when the partner obtains
the lead for the first time, If he' has a card that
will assist in the establishment of his partner's
suit, he should lead it at once, always bearing
in mind that a very long suit will seldom, if
ever, go round more than twice: or, should he
have four trumps, better still commence at
once to exhaust them, if no one has "called 1 '
or started a cail. It is often the best whist to
do so, even from three, particularly if you have
a re-entry card and can force the last trump
from 'he adversary. In this case 1 would al
ways do it.
Again, should the original leader open a suft
not very strong, and his partner lias a better
one, he should inform him at once by his re
turn lead, speaking by the card, and should
say, "The suit I am leading from is a better one
than you opened, aud therefore you must
abandon yours and assist me to establish this
one iv my hand."
The essence of all good whist piny is to make
all the tricks possible in each hand. In our
opinion the long and strong suit system is the
best way of accomplishing it. But should
neither you or your partner hold such a suit,
then I contend is the time to go in for a rufling
or short-suit game. I claim that it is not good
whist for the original ieader to open his best
suit aud expect his partner when he cut-, the
lead to do the same, merely to show the strong
suit of each partner, as advocated by some au
thorities. There is no case on record where in
one deal two plain suits were ever established
and brought in. This being a fact what Is the
use of following such line of play.
In this same article the writer took issue
with Cavendish and urged the adoption of
the fourth best from aoe and four small.
Since his letter was written the latter has
become universally adopted in this coun
try.
"Commenting on the above letter John
H. Briggs, whose fame as a whist-player
and whist'writer is known wherever whist
is played, says:
Your advice upon the return of your part
ner's suit was a great surprise to me. It has
been a wonder that whist-players have not dis
covered the truths which you teil your readers
on the subject. You ought to have a great
deal of interest shown in your good work, but
I suppose the "cranks" pass it by because it is
free, and probably most of them can beat the
books.
As a warning to short-suit players we
submit the following from the pen of
Milton C. Work in the Evening Telegraph
of a recen: date on short-suit leads without
vital reason :
We do not know a Philadelphia player of
any considerable whist caliber who belleVes in
short-suit doctrines, but there are many who
take an occasional "Uyer." A short-suit hand
which occurred in the second lour match be
tween Hamilton and Art last night, however,
will doubtless prove a warning against such
experiments in important matches. The
leader cards were four trumps, king,
eiÂ«ht and two small, ace, queeu, jack
and two others of one side suit, a
small singleton and a three-card suit, headed
byaten. The lead of the ten cost live tricks,
and would have cost six had a trick not been
lost in the end play by the other side. Yet
this is the ifieal short-suit hand, viz.: open
ing a strengthening card and keeping a tenaoe
to be led up to. The player who led the sbort
suit got his tcnace not led up to but led
through and found the king solus to his left.
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
We nre asked "When that Woodland
match is to take place."
James H. Doolittle of the St. Nicholas
Ho.el, an ardent devotee of whist, ar
ranged a match came between the Wood
land Whist Club of Woodland and th-
Trist Duplicate Whist Club of this Citye
and for some unknown reason he backs,
out.
Wo are asked our opinion in regard to
the original lead of jack or queen from ace,
king, queen, jack and others. It is a mat
ter of no great importance, but it certainly
simplifies the jack lead, and for that reason
alone we consider it a good innovation for
advanced players to lead queen from this
combination, and when you lead jack you
deny holding the ace.
G. H. D.â On trick 4 East led 8 of dia
monds. West holding 4 small should re
tain the lowestâ play third best â when
he cannot head the trick; for the pur
pose of enabling partner to count num
ber, and on second round of the same
suit he should play second best remaining.
WHISTLETS.
On Saturday, June 27, t&e last day of the
A. W. L. congress, there is to be a bicycle
parade, and it is estimated that at least
10,000 wheelmen will oarticipate. All
whist-players and delegates are recom
mended to bring their wheels with them.
The Call would like to ask how a whist
player could get there without "wheels" â
they all have them.
The international whist match proposed
by the Whist Editor of The Call is very
likely to bear fruit. The London News of
April 7 says a move is on foot to attain
that end.
C. S. Averill and wife of Syracuse, N. V.,
have been spending a few weeks in Cali
fornia. Mr. Averill and our Whist Editor
were boys together â no wonder he loves
whist. Mrs. Averill is a student of the
game also.
SAN FRANCISCO WHIST CLUB.
(Announcement for May, 1896.)
The ladies' trophy play will be continued as
already announced. Regular tournaments on
Monday, Wednesday and Saturday evenings
will be as heretofore. No prizes will be awarded
excepting on the evening of Wednesday, May
20, when the couple making the highest num
ber of points above the average (subject to
handicap) >ylll be awarded prizes.
The continuous play of straight whist for
prizes, as previously announced, will continue
until further notice. The game will be found
interesting, and it is hot>ed that each member
will qualify for the prize by playing the requi
site number of thirty games.
The entire front page of Leslie's Weekly,
one of the leading illustrated papers of
New York, is given up to a beautiful draw
ine, "An Evening at Whist."
E. C. Howell's new book now in press
will be out in a few weeks. It will treat
on the "Strategic Game."
The announcement for whist play in
the Trist Duplicate Whist Club for May is
the same as April, with one exception.
No more straight whist will be played on
Saturday nights. Duplicate only â visitors
like it better.
The whist play ot the great French ex
pert Deschapelles often called forth out
bursts of applause, such ns handclapping
and cheers from the onlookers. We know
of only one instance in this country where
such a thing happened.
Whist-players in England always score
honors. Players in this country never do.
ANSWERS TO PROBLEM 5.
We received fifty-three letters inclosing
solutions to problem 5. Eleven out of the
number are correct. They were received
in the following order:
First, Mrs. F. H. Atwater, Petaluma; second,
J. McKiustry, San Francisco; third, J. E. Mc-
Gowan, San Francisco; fourth, George E.
Housken, Stockton; fifth, Eliza R. Dainger
field, San Francisco; sixth, H. H. Hotaling
Han Francisco; seventh. Walter A. Stafford,
Stanford University; eighth, Theo Rosseter,
Alaineda; ninth, Eglantine Caldara, San
Francisco; tenth, John B. McNamar, Atlas;
eleventh, E. C. Brown, Oakland.
The following comes from far-off Maine:
Brunswick, Me., April 27, 1896.
Dear Editor: In answer to your Petaluma
whist problem of April 12, we beg leave to
submit the following an the only natural and
practical aaswer to the question:
South takes the trick with the queen of dia
monds and returns the six of clubs. This
seems to be, without doubt, the only lead In
dicated by the fall of the cards, and if followed
out correctly gives the side five tricks.
Trumps are contra-indicated of course; it is
not a place for the short-suit lead of the single
ton Jrmjr of hearts; and the fall of East's jacs
on North's lead of diamonds bars that suit, so
the simple lead oi the long and strong suit of
clubs is all that is left. For having applied
the eleven rule, South sees that the control of
diamonds lies with himself and his partner
and it Is his manifest duty to indicate to North
the other suit on which they must rely for
tricks, the strength in trump's being declared
against them.
The other deal given in the same number re
t quires no discussion, being of course a natu
ral "slam" baud.
Though across the continent we very much
enjoy your whist items. Respectfully yours,
â¢The Friday Night Duplicate Whist Club."
Harry B. Rcss, Secretary, of Brunswick, Me.
When we published problem 5 we
made the following statement:
"We will give a whistbook to the first
one that sends us the number of tricks
that North and South can make playing
thi* hand asryou please, all cards exposed
or otherwise."
Mrs. Atwater was the "first" to send us
the correct solution. She wins the prize.
We request her to send us the title of the
book she would like â any one published in
this country. Mrs. Atwater's analysis of
the play is as follows:
South gets out three rounds of trumps
and at trick 4 leads the thirteenth trump
and forces a discard from all the others,
which has the most effect on West's hand.
If West discards j. heart South leads ace
of clubs then the deuce of hearts. If West
discards a diamond North makes four
heart tricks instead of five, and South
makes three diamonds instead of two.
If West should discard a club, then at
trick 6 South would lead queen club,
an.l then go on with hearts as before.
Trick 7 South must here lead his ace clubs,
as he might later in the hand block the
club Buit in North band.
This deal occurred in actual play some
years ago and is known as "the" great
Vionna coup."

Puppy.
NEWYORK, N. V., May 4.â "ln the
days of old"â that was what I heard com
ing up the staircase. Tne voice that sang
the words never knew the days of old,
though it was a sweet, clear one. But the
words themselves set me to wondering.
Were the days of old better than these
days? In the days of long ago, were men
and women any better, and nobler, or was
life more desirable? It is true that
in the days of old nobody got up
early in the morning, called "Central,"
and had a row with her to gain
the morning amiability. In the days
of long ago nobody telegraphed a "How
do-you-do" to San Francisco and got a
"Good evening" in such a short time that
it could not be counted. Ail life was slow,
and it seems to me, somehow, tnat all life
was better. There were some luxuries
missing. We did not have strawberries in

(/(/ laitft Street, corner if ]m% /
January, nor did youne ladies start out i
with black locks in the morning and ap
pear with blonde ones in the evening. In :
the days of old peroxide of hydrogen was
unknown on the toilet table, although j
there were wonderful mixtures for soften- I
ing the skin, for making the hair more j
glossy and the hands more soft.
People did not have as many clothes in i
the old times. A matron freshened from I
season to season the black satin or black !
silk that was her "best dress." and only |
brought out on special occasions, such as i
the marriage of a son or a daughter, the |
brocade that, it was whispered, came from
France. With this brocade was worn,
not twenty yards of imitation, but one i
yard of real lace, and, the festivity over, |
it was carefully put away and remained j
in the seclusion of a carved chest, with j
the perfume of cloves and lavender, until
another feast day came about. In those !
old days servants were better. Why? |
Because mistresses took an interest in
them, and the one that intended to marry
was assisted in getting her household
linen, while the one who nursed "my |
mother and all her children, me and all |
my children, "'wa9 buried from the house
of her mistress, often beside her mistress,
and laid to sleep forever with that best
tribute, love and sincere tears. In those
old days men made love to women
as they do nowadays, but that love-mak
ing culminated in marriage. Men spoke
to women with more reverence than they
do just now, and when young Knicker- j
bocker took to visiting Miss Stuyvesant
every Sunday night both families knew
what it meant, and Mme. Knickerbocker
and Mme. Stuyvesant loosed through tueir
linen chests to see what could be spared,
and Mme. Stuyvesant wondered if it would
be wise to give these young people, just j
starting in life, a silver tea service. Now- I
adays, their descendants demand diamond j
tiaras, necklaces and wonderful sunbursts j
that too often cover hearts that have mar
ried for diamonds and not for crowns of
love. In those old days a mother willed
her fur cloak to her daughter; it was
worth it; it was real sable or real ermine,
and styles did not change with the fancy
of every cocotte, as they do nowadays. A
well-cut, weil-made garment was in the j
fashion, and the mother's fur surcoat was I
gladly assumed Dy the daughter and willed j
by her to her eldest daughter.
In those days marriage didn't mean, al
ways, the union of great wealth and great
social power; sometimes a man married
entirely for love, and his father could sym
pathize with him, even though his mother
longed for him to wed one of the rich
young ladies who came ot an afternoon to
knit and drink coffee with her.
But the father's heart went out to the
son and he settled a dower on the poor
girl and the marriage meant the maniug
of a home; indeed, it meant more than
that. It meant surrounding two young
people with six or eight, or ten or twelve
little people, born of their love, and each
greeted gladly. Nowadays, marriage too
often means a hotel and a puppy.
I am fond of dogs, but there is no dog
that can take the place of a baby, aud no
people who are married can find perfect
happiness when they make their tamily
consist of their two selves and a dog. It is
true that there are some unhappy people
to whom God doesn't send little children;
but those to whom he does send them
should receive them with open arms and
remember that, as they are children born
of wedded love, so they will encourage and
keep young the wedded love forever. In
these days women forgot the wonderful
bond that a little child is. What foolish
women they are ! A husband may be led
astray, may sin grievously, but if he can
ask his pardon through the eyes of a little
child where is the wife who would not
grant it to him? A wife may seem foolish,
a bit tiresome, and sometimes even silly,
but if her love for her husband lisps itself
in the voices of little children her weak
nesses will be forgotten and only her vir
tue remembered. And yet there are
women who do not care to be mothers!
In those days of old, women may have
beenâ if such a thing is possibleâoverreli
gious. And such a thing is possible â in a
way. The hot Sunday dinner was un
known and children wept over the cate
chism and went to sleep and were wakened
up to hear the clergyman preach about the
horrors of hell and the certainty of small
boys and small girls getting there, but
somehow it made a good backbone in men
and women, did that queer religious treat
ment. I have known what it was to sit
upon a bench, that was uncushioned, at a
silent meeting; no preaching avainst hell
ever equaled that. For that meant two
hours of absolute silence, ending in a sigh,
of relief, when the older Quakers, who sat
up and faced_ everybody, shooK hands.
During that time there came before me, as
no preacher could have painted it,
the sins I had committed. I remem
bered kicking NÂ°d, the dog; I re
membered sticking out my tongue
at Henry Clay, the canary bird, and I re
membered, worst of all. that when I was
sent up to the bathroom one day and told
to wash my face and bands thoroughly,
I only gave them what in ray Southern
home would be called "a lick and a prom
ise." I tell you, my friend, that a still
meeting of two hours will convince a sen
sitive child that it stands before God on a
par with Judas and Ananias. Uut this
never hurt me. In fact, I think I always
felt better, and as I frisked home, hanc
ing to my grandfather's hand, I would
nod at father Gibbons and stretch my
mouth very wide to Bbow that my sec
ond teeth were all quite in. But those
days are only, after all, a little while ago.
They seem like yesterday to me. Here is
a question for the very learned people â
why is it that we forget the wonderful
things that happened a month ago and
remember so perfectly everything that
happened twenty-five years ago? The
X rays cannot explain that.
To be quite honest, I have very little
belief in the X rave. What good will it
do some girl who is horribly unhappy,
inasmuch as she feels she is to be a victim
to consumption, to have an X ray thrown
on her and make the doubt a certainty?
Yes, my friend, I am a believer in hope. It
is an old-fashioned belief, but then 1 am a
bit old-fashioned and have a leaning even
toward Judas, fully believing that
While the lamp holds out to burn
The vilest sinner may return.
In the days of old, women who did not
believe were unknown. Nowadays we
may have cleverer womenâ l doubt it.
But in those days little children hunp
around their mother's knees and learned
to say their prayers, and, later on, when
they were big children and the sorrows
of life came to them they returned to that
mother and wept out on her heart the
griefs that they could not tell. Bab.

SUNDAY .....MAY 10, 1896
IKE: CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Cleveland is evidently trying to work
Ihe civil service like a buuko game.
Patriotism, protection and prosperity is
the battle-cry that rallies the people this
year.
The trouble with the outing season up to
date is that the weather hasn't given it an
inning.
The weather we complain of would strike
the Eastern people as a breath from
heaven.
The San Joseah may talk through his
hat this morning, but he cannot get his
head in it.
If Weyler is as wise as Kruger he will let
the captured nUbu3ters go and be glad of
the chance.
From a Republican standpoint the cam
paign will be simply a continuation of the
festival season.
Sooner or later San FranciÂ«co will have
to adopt the festival fashion or be counted
out of the State.
Before Congress finishes with the appro
priations it should provide a gas-. .eater
annex to the weather bureau.
Auburn, Healdsburg and San Jose have
had their dances, but more festivals are to
comeâ the season is young yet.
A correspondent writes that this year in
California "G. O. P." stands Jor gallant
old party â it embraces the ladies.
It remains to be seen whether the silence
of Grover Cleveland is a mystery story or
just a plain case of a dumb waiter.
It is an assured thing that the fruits of
politics this year will be the most whole
some crop we have had in a long time.
There must have been something of a
fin-de-siecle movement on the expedition
up the Nile, for it is out of sight already.
Failing to annex the Transvaal by the
arms of Jameson, England still has hopes
of taking it in by the diplomacy of Cham
berlain.
If Chicago doesn't wish to be ashamed
of holding the Democratic Convention sne
had better make arrangements at once to
keep it quiet.
By his civil-service order Cleveland has
done all he can to keep his pets in office in
spite of what he knows the people will do
in November.
If the Democratic factions at Chicago
succeed in binding themselves together it
will be with barbed wire and the squirm
ing will be great.
As San Jose had to put her festival pa
vilion outside her corporate limits, it is
evident she is not big enongii to hold her
self when she has a spread on.
It is now reDorted that the damage to
the fruit crop is not so great as was feared
at hrst. This is one of the years when the
latest outlook is always the beet.
If the refunding scheme can be headed
off at tiiis session of Congress it will be
virtually defeated, for ttiH next one will be
too short to get a long jub through.
The woman's congress has adjourned,
but its influence will be kept vital by The
Call until the campaign is over and the
great battle for equal buffrage has been
won.
Republican clubs in California should be
organized in time to display themselves in
good shape and strone force at the ratifi
cation meetings that will follow the Na
tional Convention.
Providence will not temper the wind to
the shoru lamb of the. Democratic flock
this year. There will be nothing but cold
days tor them until they are put on the
roast in November.
The oniy Democrat who has found t.ny
favor as a Presidential candidate outside
of his ov.n fetate is Russell of Massachu
setts, and he has not found it any further
oS than Rhode Island.
The well-ordered condition of the Re
publican party when compared witu the
confusion in tne Democratic camp shows
the value to an organization of having a
leader who knows bow to lead.
The aspiration for a greater California
should be Kept in mind throughout the
campaign, and every voter^snould work
for the party whose measures and men
will best assure the prosperity necessary
to attain it.
From the eagerness of Hill to fight all
the battles of the Democratic administra
tion it would seem he is going to ask the
leadership on the Presidential ticket not
because he is the most tit but because he
has nt the most.
The Examiner thinks the Republican
candidate for the Presidency will have to
be a centipede to stand on all the planks
that have been prepared for him, but it
overlooks the fact that the Democratic
candidate will have to be a erub worm to
get into the hole that has been prepared
for bim.
CALIFORNIA'S PROSPERITY.
Whatever the importance to California
of the many things that are desired at the
bands of the Nation and however desira
ble it ia that the patriotic people of the
State work with all diligence for National
appreciation there are great* domestic
problems for our own people to solve un
aided. The vast resources of the State
still await development and the extent of
our achievements in that direction will
measure the consideration which we may
expect from the whole country. It will
not even be sufficient if we induce non
residents of means, energy and ability to
come and add their efforts to ours, though
there should be no relaxing of endeavor in
that direction. Apart from all these duties
is the one resting upon us to do all that we
can in developing the wealth lying under
our hands and awaiting our enterprise.
That is the first necessity in securing the
prosperity of California.
There are some among us who appre
ciate that fact. The greatest single enter
prise now under the direction of Califor
nians is the San Francisco and San
Joaquin Valley Railroad. It represents
an investment of about $6,000,000, but that
is the least of the considerations which it
involves. It is distinctly unique in con
ception.
While started as a legitimate business
enterprise, it deliberately established the
policy of abandoning any conceivable op
portunity to make enormous profits at the
expense of the people, and bound itself to
a reasonable income on the investment.
That was a radical departure from the es
tablished policy of those transportation
companies which have grown enormously
rich by charging all that the traffic could
bear, without any reference to the amount
of ttie investment.
t Another unique feature of the enter
prise is the relief which it will afford to
shippers, who for so many years have
borne excessive burdens. That will mean
for producers and merchants between San
Francisco mid Bakerstield a charge on
their wares that will enable them to pros
per. These charges, instead of being
based, as in the past, on the shipper's
margin of profit, will be regulated solely
by the desire of the company to secure a
return of 6 per cent on its investment.
That is something ntartingly new in Cali
fornia. TnkinÂ« into account the fact that
under fair conditions the rewards of in
dustry should be generous in this State, it
is evident that the policy of the Valley
road will leave a margin of profit to ship
pers that they liave never been permitted
to retain in the past. The-e matters are
clearly understood by the intelligent peo
ple of the Â£an Joaquin Valley. The rapid
development which that fertile section
will experience under the new conditions
will act directly unon the welfare of San
Francisco, and will simplify California's
task in demanding a wise National recog
nition of its needs.
ETHICS AND ECONOMICS.
A form of government like the United
States, in which the sovereign or supreme
power is lodge.d in the people collectively,
is deeply concened in the ethical as well
as in the economic well-being of every cit
izen. It was because these two factors in
the work of expanding the nation's mate
rial interests became antagonistic, one to
ward the other, and thus obstructed the
country's onward march, that necessity
gave birth to the Republican party. Hence
it is that every consistent Republican is
not only interested in the accumulation of
wealth by the people as a whole, but he is
intrusted with its distribution, lie could
not with satisfaction witness trade expan
sion and industrial growth unless all the
people were participating somewhat, at
least, in ratio to the worth of each indi
vidual effort in the operation. His Repub
lican doctrine teaches him that although
it is the people's duty collectively to pro
mote the Nation's welfare, the ultimate
purpose of all effort should be individual
prosperity and happiness.
The building up or tolerating of a social
status or property holdings with a plu
tocracy at the top and a proletariat at the
bottom would be in direct antagonism to
the principles of the Republican party.
This is absolutely true, becauso the cen
tral principle of Republicanism, around
which all others cluster, is that any in
crease in the general wealth of the country
that goes by arbitrary economic forces
into the hands of a few is doing great harm
and injustice to the many, besides weak
ening the ethical and political strength of
the Nation as a whole. The only true
system of wealth growth, says Republi
canism, is that which broadens and ele
vates the manhood of all concerned.
The spirit of the principles of the Re
publican party teaches that business effects
reach their highest and strongest unfold
ment when they are produced by ethical
causes; hence, the business enterprise
whose operatives participate in the distri
bution in the way of wages to the full
meÃsure of their worth is an ideal business
enterprise, and it is these conditions of
existence that the Republican party is
working to establish through the operation
of laws that shall encourage such condi
tions and protect them as well. The Re
publican party denies with vehemence the
theory of government and economic prop
osition that there is permanency of social
or National life where one class of the
people is permitted to accumulate wealth
while another class sink in want and
misery.
A CLIMATIC ANOMALY.
It is hoped that the Weather Bureau
will pay diligent attention to the record
of "sensible temperatures," and that the
newspapers of California will lend every
encouragement to the work. The climates
of this State, like every other condition
with which we have to deal, are aa novel
and perplexing as they are various. The
publication of a bald record of thermo
metrieal readings is misleading and inade
quate, a citizen of New York, who sees
men and horses there succumbing to sun
stroke when the thermometer begins to
approach 100 degrees, can hardly be ex
pected to find a strong invitation in a sim
ilar reading for a thermometer in the
interior valleys of California, and when he
is told that notwithstanding this fact sun
strokes aud the terrible diseases peculiar
to Eastern summers are unknown here it
is natural for him to doubt the truth of
the assertion.
On the other hand, when the New Yorker
arrives at San Francisco in the middle of
summer, and discovers the thermometer
registering 80 degrees, he will likely com
mit the serious blunder of assuming that
the day is warm, and, acting on that con
clusion, mny wear light clothing, and with
out an overcoat take a trip on an open car
to the beach. If he escapes a severe cold
he is fortunate. The established residents
of the City have learned from experience
that the readings of the thermometer are
not a trustworthy guide for dress. Jfence,
while the readings in the interior of the
State indicate a temperature which in the
Eastern States would prohibit N hard labor
and induce sunstrokes and diseases fatal
to children, the readings on the coast are
equally misleading in tne opposite direc
tion by showing a temperature much
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 10, 1896.
higher than can be taken into account in
precautions against cold.
That is to say, both of these opposing
conditions are in turn opposed to the
Eastern experience. That presents a very
complex situation, but its elements are re
ducible to simple formulas. The records
of the Weather Bureau, unfortunately for
California, are based on Eastern prece
dents and experience, and these operate
diametrically against the conditions pre
valent here. It is largely a question of
humidity and winds. On a hot sum
mer day in the interior of California we
generally find both, extreme atmospheric
dryness and a considerable breeze. One
of these conditionsâ particularly that of
drynessâ is constant, for the reason that
there are no rains. As a result the
moisture which the bodies of all ani
mals, including men, is constantly giv
ing out through the skin is instantly
evaporated, and evaporation produces a
lowering of temperature. In the Eastern
States an excess of atmospheric humidity
and an absence of winds prohibit, sepa
rately or together, this evaporation, and
In consequence the bodily temperature, in
stead of being cooled by evaporation, is
forced up to blood heat plus the excess of
atmospheric heat above that point. That
means danger.
Likewise the constant strong winds that
blow from the ocean upon the coast
greatly lower the temperature of the body,
while not similarly affecting the ther
mometer. That is because the dry-bulb
therraometer.which isthe standard of East
ern thermal measurements, is insensible
to the action of winds. A wet-bulb ther
mometer shows a very different and lower
reading, and that is the temperature we
feel. It is incumbent on the Weather
Bureau officers and the press of California
to give us a class of readings suited to our
peculiar conditions. This is called the
"sensible temperature."
THE FUNCTION OF CREDIT.
The time was when the dealer and trader
in nierchandis â¢ would go with the ship or
caravan or wagon train and personally su
perintend the disposition of his commodi
ties on the cash down system. There was
no commercial credit in those days except
between neighbors, but that was before
the invention of the telegraph and the
railway. Faith in t. c business integrity
of fellow-merchants is now coined into
token money, so to speak, and public car
riers assume the responsibility of trans
porting articles of merchandise from initial
to distinctive points, and instead of the
owner or his messenger going with the
shipment to collect pay the shipper at
taches his bill of lading to a draft upon she
consignee and his banker cashes it. Only a
few years ago the draft became the mer
chant's messenger, but ro great has the
credit system grown that its dimensions
are beyond the power of any one to com
pute, and its ramifications are earth wide.
It i-- sai I that our bank clearing-house I
system furnishes the equivalent of more I
tuan twice the per capita mouey of tne !
country, and yet only the larger trade cen- j
ters maintain such institutions, and their :
clearings represent not more, than 50 per \
cent of all the business transacted by the '
people. Moreover, an examination of !
clearing-house reports will show that only '
about 10 or 15 per cent of ~the total clear- <
ings are settled with cash, and tiiat very !
often a creditor bank will reclear its cer- !
tificaies, thus still further reducing the
amount of actual money employed.
Our commercial exchanges add a still j
greater volume of substitutes for money. A j
country buyer of produce can conduct his j
business with bills of lading attached to
drafts, so that the actual capital which he !
employs may not be more that 5 or 10 per I
cent of the value of his shipments. The i
time note becomes token money the !
moment it is offered for sale or discount, j
There is no wav of knowing how many
thousand million dollars, as represented
by credit drafts attached to shipping bills, !
are moving to and from the business cen
ters every day, but it is estimated that
fully three billion dollars' worth of mer
chandise are afloat in the ships of the
world every hour, and which is moving on
the faith of, individual credit.
There is another kind of credit which
the United States enjoys more than any
other nation. This Government has out
standing a large number of bonds, green
backs and national bank and treasury
notes, but the holders of these several
promises to pay have no security whatever
except the willingness and the ability of
the people to redeem their pledges in
metallic money. Our national bank notes
are secured by Government bonds, but
there is nothing behind the bonds except <
the moral sense of the people. Tbis is the
highest credit, for it is based wholly upon
the integrity of the people who authorized
the bonds, bans notes aud Government
paper money to be issued. But the credit
of this Government, unlimited as it now
is, could be impaired by continuing a
policy that caused expenditure for main
tenance to run in excess of income and
provided for deficits by borrowing money.
The Government, like the individual, for
feits its credit when it lives beyond its
means.
AMERICAN CONSERVATISM.
Among the thousand phases which the
complex condition of our politics discloses
at this time there is none more notable in
itself or more gratifying to patriots than
the calm steadiness with which the con
servative element of the people face the
problems before them, and the almost
perfect unity of sentiment which pre
vails among them as to the best means of
overcoming the difficulties that stand in
the way of a return to National prosperity.
The conditions are such as would fill
almost any other people on the globe with
impatience and excitement and divide
them into the impotence of a thousand
discordant factions. We have seen the In
dustries of the country in the full career of
an abounding prosperity checked so sud
denly as to throw everything into confu
sion and produce an immense disaster.
We have seen banks suspended, factories
closed, trade paralyzed, farms made un
profitable and workingmen forced into
idleness. Presiding over this ruin we
have seen an administration at once vacil
lating and obstinate, incompetent and
dogmatic. Thus to the disasters of busi
ness has been added the bungling of the
Government, and new irritations and in
juries coming month after month have for
three years been vexing every industry,
checking every trade and harassing every
interest.
To remedy all these evils many measures
are necessary. There must be a restora
tion of protection, oi reciprocity, of bi
metallism, uf a mercantile marine and a
more extensive undertaking of internal
improvements and coast and naval de
fenses. With so many measures to engage
public attention and eacn of such import
ance, it is a remarkable proof of the politi
cal capacity of the conservative element
of me American people that they can give
to each its rightful value and avoid exalt
ing any ono at tue cost of others. Despite
all the zeal of doctrinaires declaring this
thing or that thing to be the supreme is
sue, despite the clamor of radical or erratic
citizens shouting in response to the zealots,
the great mass of the people remains calm,
studying the whole field with serenity and
resolved to deal with each measure on its
merits and carry them all forward in one
grand comprehensive policy for the wtl
fare of the country.
In addition to the confusing effect of so
many great issues before the peopie at one
time, there is the further complexity that
the dominant party has no less than four
men with about equal claims upon it con
tending for the leadership. In this
rivalry, however generous it may be
between the great leaders themselves,
there is a natural tendency toward mutual
antagonism among their more excitable
partisans. Each croup demands that its
own particular favorite shall be honored
and will listen to no argument from others
or for others. Here again, however, the
conservative element shows its calm
strength and political wisdom. It is as
steadfast amid the cries of personal parti
sans as amid those of the zealots of par
ticular measures. It will deal with leaders
aa with doctrines, and, choosing the best,
will harmonize all.
There is no other people on earth that
could face this complexity of issues and
rivalry of chieftains with anything like
the political sagacity the American people
are now displaying. Among any other peo
ple there would be a party for every great
measure and a faction for every great
leader, but there would be r.o strong, domi
nant conservative majority establishing
harmony in the midst ol dissensions and
making it possible for statesmanship to
survive political emergencies. This char
acteristic of our people is the salvation of
the Republic. It assures not only perma
nence to our institutions, but steadiness to
our policies, and muses clear the way for
prosperity under circumstances where peo
ple less politically wise would rushintoex
tremes and make confusion worse con
founded.
The celebration at Monterey of the fif
tieth anniversary of the raising of the
American flag over California ought to be
mane one of the greatest festivals of the
season. It appeals to every loyal senti
ment from Slate pride to National patriot
ism and will inspire the patriotic with a
true enthusiasm.
Among all the undertakings of the State
there ia none that more truly marks the
general progress toward prosperity than
the Valley road whose continuous advanc
ment means the overthrow of the monop
oly and the promotion of the welfare of
all industries within reach of its extend

IN LESS SERIOU S MOOD.
By Charles D. BOUTS.
Sycamore Springs, in Sau Luis Obispo county,
a decnde ago, was known as the "Oil Wells."
The existence of mountains of bituminous rock
iv the vicinityn ity and tne fact that near-by streams
gave slight surface indications of oil inclined
many to the belief that a river of oil was flow
ing directly underneath. To tapit might mean
the realization of millions. An expert from
Pennsylvania pronounced the character of the
boil there quite similar to that of the oil re
gions of the Keystone State. At Sun Luis
Obitpo a company of capitalists whs formed to
push forward the oil project and in a short
time a well had been sunk and pumping had
begun. The work at the oil wells was in charge
of an engineer by the name of Snauldiug. He
had been digging and pumping away
vigorously for some time, apparently in
spired by an abiding confidence in
the certainty of â uecett, as well as a
money consideration, when one evening he
sent up a shout of joy aud dispatched a mes
senger into the city with the glad tidings that
he had "struck oil." Tne capitalists and some
friends drove out on the following morning to
make an inspection. Spaulding gave them a
jubilant greeting and strulgntway led them
to the well. Taking up a handful of freshly
thrown-up .â¢-and at the mouth of the well he
held it within an inch of the nose of the fore
most of the party.
"Smell of that!" cried Spaulding.
"Oil, sure as you breathe," exclaimed the
person addressed. In another moment every
body on the ground was excitedly repeating
the same thing: "Oil! no doubt about it I"
The news spread rapidly and everybody in the
"oil belt" began to dig. The company bought
up as many as possible of these otherwise
prospective opponents in the oil industry, and
the members of the combine were naturally
proud of their Ion? heads and of their shrewd,
farsighted steps toward the consummation of
a monopoly.
Big plans were under consideration. Several
moneyed men from abroad desired to secure
shares in the enterprise. Another excursion
was organized an.l arrived unexpectedly at
the oil wells. It came at a most inopportune
time, so far as the engineer was concerned, for
Spaulding was lying in bed with an attack of
rheumatism.
"What?" he yelled in an almost affrighted
way when an assistant rushed up with the in
formation that a crowd was at the wells.
"Great Caesarl Tell 'em the sand at the well
isn't fresh. Oil's evaporated. I'll be down
soon aud work the pump."
Meantime the visitors had surrounded the
well and were nosing and suifflng around in
the futile endeavor to discover truces of oil in
the sand. Disappointment shone on all faces.
"What's the matter with your oil indica
tions?" queried somebody as Spauldiug limped
up to the well.
"You see," replied Spaulding, readily,
"there wa3 a sort of cave-iu yesterday and the
sand you've been trying's from near the sur
face. I've ordered a sandwich lunch for the
crowd down at the fcoarding-house, and while
you folks are there I'll just set this pump to
working again."
Returning from lunch the party found that
fresh sand had been thrown up, and that this
sand was strongly impregnated with oil. Those
who looked straight into Spaulding's eyes
found nim looking straight back with all the
candor of innocence.
There was no enthusiasm among the excur
sionists on the home journey, and Spaulding
threw up his job that very night.
'â¢That's the meanest tninn I ever did," hede
olared. -'Alter I'd started the joke with a can
of kerosene oil I didn't know when to let up!"
But Spaulding had struck a flow of white
sulphur water, and some of the goid that was
sunk with the object of bringing up oil from
the rich dream-river below was lured back
ngain by the "White Sulphur Baths" which
were, built on the site of ihe well that showed
indications of "refined oil."
"There's any quantity of oil in San Luis
Obispo County," said one of the pioneers of
that region to me; "but the work of that wag
of an engineer, Spaulding, has scared every
body out of the notion of boring for it."
Wnat a world of deceit this is! And how
often may we not be uujust to the suffering
poor by confounding the prayer of need with
the well-rehearsed imitation of that appeal by
the professional faker. I was turning from
the street into the stairway of a business bouse
when a cripple, ragged and leaning on
crutches, accosted me. Halting for a moment
under the lamp at the entrance I looked him
over. It was rather late in the evening and
rather cold as well. In appearance the fellow
was quite an object of pity and the.'C were
tears in his voice as he nervously, rapidly un
reeled his tale.
"A strtugerâ without friendsâ l am nearly
frozen, aud I hate to beg, but a man'll do
almost anything when he's shivering and half
starved. I want to sleep to-night and
I've got but 15 cents. Give me a dime for
God's sake and then I'm told I can get half
decent treatment for to-night. Show me any
job I can do tor you and I'll thank you. No, I
don't know the taste of liquor. I've passed
through hard times. Imagine yourself all
alone and crippled like me, kicked and cuffed
about and out in the night imploring charity.
I suppose it'll all have to wind up in the bay.
I'd be better dead anyhow."
The cripple wiped a tear from his cheek
with a dirty sleeve. I dropped him a dime,
and as I pursued my way upstairs I hali re
gretted that I hadn't given a quarter.
"Well," thought I, "if the inau is really in
need it was all he asked for; and if he was de
ceiving me I have lost very little."
From the top of the stairway I looked down,
and to my surprise the cripple was standing at
the doorway still. A second victim yielded
him a quarter; a third put a dime in his hand
with an expression of pity. A fourth â a fifth
contributed his mite; and still the cripple kept
repeating to each newcomer his well-worn
story. I could delay no longer and I ceased
my study. That cripple gathered in a dollar
or more in the brief time that I watched him
from the head of the stairs. I am inclined to
think that his receipts for a whole evening
would loot up close to five dollars.
At a later date, while I walked with a friend
along a crowded street, that same "cripple"
stepped in front of us. There was no mistak
ing the voice and face, although the beggar's
crutches had disappeared and he wore one
arm in a sling. The fact was that he had
grown tired of limping around on one foot,
and the "burned-arm" idea served as a relief.
My friend spoke in heavy tones: "Burned
arm now, eh? If you bother me I'll hand you
over to the police. You're worse than a pick
pocket. Get out 1"
The words were harsh, of course, and many
good people glared at my friend, commenting
silently, it would seem, on his apparent dis
play of utter heartiessness. But those good
people heard not the plea of the professional
faker as he slid aside: "Say, now, I ain't goiu'
to bother you. Letageeser make his dough,
can't you? Don't queer me with the whole
mob! See?" And the fortune-hunter was
seeking new prospects.
Yet, as was inferred above, the needy poor
starving, perhaDS, and forced in sheer despera
tion to ask for alms â are often denounced as
shuns and frauds and turned away with looks
that sting like blows.
From roof, door, window burst the flames:
The house became a furnace dire;
TmÂ» firemen fled from the battle dread
'Gainst the dashing spears of the conquering fire.
Theu a mother's cry the great throng thrillsâ
â 'My child! My child!" was a" she said.
The people they heard, but no one stirred,
For surely the child in the flames was dead.
But see! The furnace has swallowed a formâ
Cremation alive is a terrible thing â
Theiv's stillness of death, as, with bated breath,
The crowd tells seconds full slow of wing.
See! Staggering from the oven of flame,
The hero a precious burden bears.
â¢' ' 'l'is a tramp!" aloud cries a man in the crowd,
"Who has saved the daughter of Banker Shares."
O. many a summer has bloomed since then;
Thai child is a maiden fair to behold.
No viilagequeen j s go loveu, I ween,
And none with richer dower of gold.
And who, pray tell, is the new rashier
In the splendid seventeen-story bank?
'T!s the tramp whose deed proved a glorious lead,
And brought him fortune and name and rank.
The banker's daughter to-day he wedsâ
The brave and the fair shall be one to-day!
What a l.sson this tale to the tramp in jail:
(You see these things on the stage m the play.)
A beautiful girl, it appears, has been hypno
tized and led to the marriage altar under the
spell. She loves not the man she married and
fain would bo divorced. Should there be no
hypnotic intervention with reference to a legal
severance of the tie that oiuds that couple,
then the husband should be exiled immedi
ately after the decree is pronounced. Other
wise that poor girl will be doomed to live in
terror of meeting that ex-husband (without the
restraining influence of a court) and of being
yanked ripht back to a marrying parson in the
same old confessedly effective way.
Can it be that the late Victor Emmanuel,
King of Italy, was in reality the father ot the
long-toed shoe? It is related that it was his
custom to allow the nail on the great toe of
either foot to grow during the whole year,
cutting off the appendix, which might be an
inch long, on the first of every January. Then
the court jeweler polished these toenails till
they a c sumed the brilliancy of cats-eyes, and
set them in gold mountings surrounded by
diamonds. Superstition regarded trice bo
diamonded toenails as "talisman?." This is
possibly a clew to the origin of the shoe with
the extraordinarily long toe. Tne late king
didn't go barefooted, and he certainly didn't
roll up his toenails.
A delegate to the Women's Convention de
clared that "savage women had more freedom
than the modern wife." It may be added, in
like way, that savage man had more freedom
than the modern husband; wherefore, we
should rejoice that we are civilized.
Rev. M. G. Hart of Melbourne, Australia, has
taken the bicycle as a topic for his pulpit, and
is putting the modern invention to a fresh
and glorious use. lie has preached a sermon
from the text (Erekiel. 10: xiii): "As for
the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hear
ing, 'O wheel!'" The clergyman is positive
that if the prophet Ezekiel lived to-day he
would ride a bicycle.
'Die bine the modern preacher took
Ills sermon's text to he:
"For roadway well-defined they look
Who on their wheels we see;
And so I he highway of the King
The Christian aye should keep;
The slider-bacK doth perils orlng;
Ko faith should fall asleep.
"Oil your machine, good work to do.
The Christian, we can prove,
God's oil of grace must trickle through
To keep him on the move.
Good company assures a man
More pleasures on the wheel;
Good company's ft thing which can
Augment a Christian's weal.
â¢â¢The little sins that men commit
Are punctures in the tire:
If sinners do not mend a bit,
They'll never pass the wire.
The wire it is the Christian gate
To Â£den, if you like.
The lesson heed ere all too lateâ
The lesson of the bike !"
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
WOES OF DEMOCRACY.
Fundamental Differences Imperil Its Ex
istence.
Editor The Callâ Sik: Even superficial ob
servers begin to realize that the great National
party which produced a Jefferson, a Jackson, a
Calhoun, a Benton and a *core of other states
men of almost equal distinction, has reached
a critical period in its history. If the differ
ences which now beset the party are indeed ir
reconcilable the last chapter of its history will
close with the campaign of 1896. It is worth
while to take a candid glance at its present
confusion and distraction. To avoid even the
suspicion of bins and unfairness let us go to
unimpeachable Democratic sources for a state
ment of the situation which confronts Demo
cracy.
Lying before me as I write is a copy of the
New York World. It is dated Wednesday,
April 29, J.B9G. On page 6, second column,
the leading editorial article is headed, "What
Will They Gain?" The opening sentence
states that "The free-silver Democrats of the
West and South hope to have a majority in the
Chicago convention." Then follows these
questions: "What can they hope to gain by
it? In what way will it advantage them
either as Democrats or free-silver men?"
In answering these questions the World
points out the fact that "the sixteen Southern
States solid have but 159 electoral votes, which
is sixty-five short of a majority." But "there
are fifty-nine votes in the South almost cer
tainly lost and forty-four imperiled." Turn
ing to the North the World declares that "the
Democrats could not hopo to carry one of the
old Northern States on the free-silver issue."
Looking westward the World asks: "Would the
new mining camp and Sagebrush States offer
any hope? But they have only thirty electoral
votesâ six less than New York alone. And
they are nearly all Republican."
IfLet us hear the World's conclusion: "Is it
worth while, either as Democrats or free-silver
men. thus to sacrifice Democrntic power and
prestige in a fantastical frenzy for one single
and hopeless idea ?" "If the free-silver Demo
crats get control of the National Convention
they might as well vote at once to make'Mc-
Kinley's election unanimous."
This is certainly & bad outlook for Democ
racy, for free-silver Democrats are not going to
vote for a gold-standard man in 1896 on a plat
form demanding the gold standard. But the
real situation, the underlying and ineradica
b c difficulty, cannot be fully disclosed by even
so plain a statement as the World has given ur.
Democracy suffers from peculiar local dif
ferences. No one of clear vision and good in
telligence in the Democratic party has any
expectation or hope of gaining a National
victory this year. What follows? A supreme
struggle in Democratic States to continue to
hold the offices and patronage of these States,
and for this purpose they will freely sacrifice
National issues In this campaign. Consider
what tills means.
It would require a column of The Call for a
full exposition of this local aspect of the Dem
ocratic struggle for existence. Let me simply
indicate it. And here I desire to let the New
York Tribune of the siune date of the World,
April 29, have a chance to be heard: "In the
death grapple of hostile Democratic factions
the Eastern Democrat know s that he has not a
chance in any Eastern State unless be can
have an unqualified declaration for the main
tenance of the gold standard with a candidate
to match.
"But the Western or Southern Democrat has
to face an overpowering demand for free silver
coinage, and he knows that with a gold plat
form a great part of the Democratic voters will
go over to the Populists, leaving the Democ
racy not merely beaten, but permanently crip
pled by the loss of the mnchinery by which
elections are carried." "The Southern Demo
crat knows right well that he will be buried
out of sight if the people get a chance to vote
and have their votes counted." "He cares not
a rap whether Democracy gains in New York
or not." "Federal offices in the South are of
no value compared with State and local offices
and the control of the party machinery." The
same considerations govern in New York The
Tribune sums up tne situation in these words:
"Tnus it is seen that the rupture in the
Democratic party goes far deeper than any
difference of belief among leaders and work
ers. It is on both sides a fight for life â at the
South because free silver and soft-money here
sies have for thirty years been taught with so
much success that Domocrutic voters are fran
tic over them, and at the North because the
induence of commercial and banking classes
has made it impossible to create such a per
nicious public sentiment."
It may be remarked in passing that the
Tribune states with refreshing candor why it
is that the free coinage of silver has so few
friends in the northeastern section of our
country. It is in|the nature of a confession.
Make note of it: "The influence of com
mercial and banking classes made it impossi
ble to create such a pernicious public senti
ment."
I think the readers of Thk Call will agree
with me that the Democratic party is in sore
straits. The all-absorbing Populists in the
South seem about to leave only the gold con
tingent in the long-time "Solid South,' and
the Republicans in the North will gather in
all but the unconditional free-silver elements.
That portion will naturally ally itself with the
new silver party which is 'to join forces with
the Populists in the support, of joint candi
dates to be nominated at St. Louis July 22.
The woes of Democracy are manifest.

The California Republican State Convention
has aoqnitted itself well. A platform with

good roads, public money for non

Not "Wholly Consistent.
Alamecla Areus.
The Republican platform is a fairly good
enunciation of principlesof the membersof the
party in California. The woman suffrage plank
is perfunctory, as are the gay bouquets thrown
to the farmer and the minpr; but as to the
protection to American industries; as to sil
ver; as to immigration and good roads,
the nail is hit fairly on the head. It should be
remembered, however, that the free-silver
plsTifenrid the doublo-riveted Indorsement of
McKlnley are not wholly and entirely con
sistent. However, as tho National Convention
outlines the party policy, the State Conven
tion s plank is presumably to be considered
only In the light of a suggestion.

are edited by G. W. Prothero, pro- j
Jt. feasor of history in the Uuivert-ity \
of Edinburgh, and the aim of
which is to sketch the history of modern
Europe with that of its chief colonies and
conquests from about the end of the
fifteenth century down to the present
time) is a "History of the United States of !
Americaâ lTHs-1565," by Edward Char
ming, Ph.D., assistunt protessor of history
at Harvard University. The author's aim '
has been to trace the steps by which the
American people and its peculiar type of
federal state have developed out of such
"heterogeneous and unpromising mate
rials" for nation building as were to be
found in the English-American colonies in
1760. Dr. Charming has given less atten
tion to campaigns and battles than is usual
in a history, and has devoted the space
thus gained to the object of elucidating
the deeper causes underlying the Ameri
can Revolution and to a detailed account
of the period between the close of the
Revolutionary war and the inauguration
of President Madison. With reference to
the Monroe doctrine the author says that
the "famous sentences which have immor
talized Monroe's name â¢ * â¢ were the
embodiment of previous statements and of
a policy well established at that time in
America." Dr. Charming furnishes no
quotations or authorities to make clear
the latter position, although Washington,
Jefferson and Madison held sentiments
quite *imilar to those expressed in the
Monroe doctrine.
The object of Monroe's declaration hav
ing been accomplished, Dr. Chaunfhg tells
us that then "the old international policy
of the United States may be said to have
terminated." It does not appear so, for
as soon as an occnsion arose the American
Congress was swift to reaffirm the Monroe
doctrine and to give it a standing in our
international policy more important than j
it occupied before. But, then, this history j
must have been completed before the
Venezuelan controversy began. The
transformation of party "systems is clearly
shown. Dr. Channine's treatment of the
causes underlying the Civil War deserves
attention. He is perfectly fair in the ;
premises. The Civil War. he says, was j
fought to determine whico of twoconcep- '
tions of the nature of the Federal tie j
should be adopted as the true interpreta
tion of the constitution of the United
States. "As this interpretation is histori
cally uncertain we cannot speak of the
war as a rebellion, for it was fought, so to '
say, to determine whether the seceders
were rebels or not. Then, too, a move
ment on such a vast scale and |
extending over such a long space
of time is something more than a rebel- !
lionâ even when unsuccessful. Further- i
more, the war was not begun to secure the i
destruction of slavery, although slavery \
was abolished as a result of the conflict." i
The war decided that the Union wag not '
a loose bundle of States, each at liberty to ,
go off and set up for itself whenever it ,
chose. The war made the United States a j
Nation, "one and inseparable." Several j
maps, very useful, both from a geographi- I
<al and historical standpoint, illustrate j
the volnme. Dr. Charming observes that i
"it is practically impossible to be abso
lately accurate In a work of this size, coy- i
ering such an extended period and dealing
with so many disputed events"; bat he i
claims to have done the utmost that a !
historical student can do â to have studied
and written "without malice in his heart." l
The work is an improvement on most of '
the short histories of the United States.
An appendix contains, among other docu
ments, the Virginia Resolves of 1769, the
Declaration of Independence, the Articles
of Confederation, the Constitution of 1787,
and the amendments to the constitution.

THOSE GOOD NORMANS.
Miss Marie Jussen , has translated from
the French Gyp's latest story, "Ces Bons
Normands,'' a serio-comic satire on the
practical character and keen commercial
instincts of the Normans. The Dutrac
family desire to get into society, and they
buy a chalet at a Norman watering-place,
with the view of embarking Dutrac pere
on a political career. They are natives of
Normandy, however, and mean to get the
worth of their millions made in trade by
establishing cordial relations with the
nobility and gentry of the neighborhood.
Madame Dutrac is a study of a hard cold
vulgarity, unredeemed by a single amiable
quality. Her coarse nature is produced in
her sons, whom she adores; while the
daughter inherits the handsome features
.and good nature of her father. The family
characters of the Dutracs are revealed in
spirited dialogue, ana numerous incidents
of their intercourse with society-folk are
related. The madame's triumph is com
plete when she succeeds in arranging a
marriage between the only son of an im
poverished noble house and her well-dow
ered daughter, who. true to her Norman
origin, never suffers sentiment to interfere
with business. [Chicago: Rand, McNally

PEBBLES AND SIIKUS.
Clarence Hawkes, "the Blind Poet of
New England," is the author of "Pebbles
and Shells," a _ volume of verse which
possesses much genuine . merit. . . Mr.
Hawkes compares . favorably in his work j
with minor poets of the present day who J
have eyes to see, and, as he is only in I his
twenty-seventh year, there is a possibility
that be may yet achieve fame in the
ranks of American singers. Clarence
Hawkes is a native of Massachusetts.
When 9 years of age he met I with an acci
dent while returning from school, which
culminated in the amputation of one leg.
When 13 years of age while. out hunting
he was accidentally shot by a companion,
and both his eyes were injured. After he
had undergone several severe operations
the hope of regaining his ' sight was aban
doned, and at the age of 15 he entered an
institute for the blind. There, in addition
to the regular course, he studied music and
piano-tuning. At the age of 21
Hawkes went upon the platform as a
lecturer, and at the same time began writ
ing short stories and poems for the local
newspapers. In all he has written 300 poems
and over 50 sketches and short stories. It is
said of him that he identities the birds by
BOOKS
BOOKMAKERS
their chirps and carols, the flowers by their
odors, shrubs by their loaves, trees by their
bark and iishes by their shapes and fins.
He is a critical musician and an expert
piano-tuner, plays chess, works a type
writer, keeps scores of baseball games and
travels all over the country without a com
panion. Most remarkable of all, he main
tains that the gamut is prismatic ami that
sounds have color. Middle 0, he says, is
deep red, and each ascending note grows
lighter by degrees, until the highest, be
comes white, while the lower tones are
graded in darker shades till the very low
est shows black. The poet has dedicated
his work to his mother, "who first inspired
him to write and has since been his con
stant helper." The volume is illustrated
by Elbridge Kinsley and contains an in
troduction by Charles Hallock. The fol
lowing selection from "Pebbles and Shells'
is a fair sample of the work of the "Blind
Poet" :
IX THE WOOD.
On woody mount in mossy dell.
Who hath not felt that miiK'f spell
That steals o'er heart and brain,
A sweet delieht that ebbs and flows
\ As freely as the zephyr blows,
Or falls the summer rain. , .
How well I know Its every moodâ
That gentle spirit of the wood !
That bids all sorrow cease:
A subtle something in the air
That softly steals away all care.
And fills the soul with peace.
It lives and breathes In every flower,
It whispers In the leafy bower
Where drowsy Insects drone;
It rises Into sweetest swells
Where the sequestered veery dwells
And chants his love alone.
It bursts Into a mighty roar
When winter sweeps the forest hoar
With howling hurricane;
It murmurs low In brooklet flood.
And smiles in every bursting bud
When sprinc comes back again.
When autumn lights her crimson flame
What, artist would not give his fame
To paint so rich and rare ?
Whei>. winter robes the firs in white,
Resplendent in the morning light,
What jewels tremble there!
How soft the wind of summer eves
That gently whispers in the leaves
Of lordly forest trees!
How wild the whirling tempest's breath
That wails the dirge of summer's death
In magic minor keys!
Ah, nature! wrap thy dreamy shade
About ill â  life that tliou hast made,
And let me slumber long!
Thine echoes softly, sweetly roll
Through bidden chambers of the soul
And teach the poet long.

-MAKK TWAIN'S JOAN OF ARC.
Mark Twain was rather out of his ele

tions of Joan of Arc." It appeared
originally in serial form in Harper's
Magazine, and did not enhance the au
thor's reputation in the least. The author
of "Innocents Abroad' must have been
hard up for material when he bit upon
La Pucelle of Domreruy. But, of course
there was more of an opportunity here for
a serio-comic book th:m the great num
ber of other historical tragedies afford
The book is supposed to be written by
"the Sieur Louis ue Comte, page and sec
retary to Joan of Arc," and translated
from the French. The book is divided
into three parts: "In Domremy " treat

inspiration; "In Court and Camp " tell

The trend of American novel-writing
toward themes of the revolutionary period
is noticeable. James Barnes has given us
a story in line with this movement under
the title, "For King or Country," It is a
story for boys, young or old, full of ad
venture and movement. George and Wil
liam Frothingham were the twin sons of
David Frothingham, who, with one of his
brothers, Nathaniel, was in charge of some
mining property in New Jersey prior to
the Revolution. David and his wife
being dead, his brother Daniel, living
in England, adopted William, while
George remained in America. When
the Revolutionary War broke out
George volunteered, and William, who was
intensely loyal to the King, entered the
British army. The twins were absolutely
alike. George took part in all the battles
about New York, and finally came to the
city on a secret errand to capture General
Howe. William was sent out as a spy on
the patriot forces. Both went through
many adventures, being constantly mis
taken for each other. Finally William be
came converted to the patriot side, and
the brothers were together once more.
Tbe description of the old "Sugar House"
pri?on in New York and of the secret
patriot societies in the city while under
British ruleâ both historical â are of es

MADELON.
A novel of genuine interest and real
literary merit is "Madelon," a story of
New England life, by Man E. Wilkins.
Madelon is in love with Burr Gordon,
and the latter's cousin, Lot Gordon, a rich
consumptive, is desirous of making the
heroine his wife. Burr will be Lot's heir,

self home. A brother of Madelon insists
upon her taking his knife with her for pro
tection in the darkness. Passing through
a wood sbe is suddenly seized from behind
and kissed. The knife is open in her hand.
She thinks the unknown is the recreant
loverâ Burrâ and she plunges the blade
into his breast. The victim proves to be
the Consumptiveâ Lot. He tells her to
j tire. Madelon meets Burr and tells him
iof her deed. He also bids her to go home.
! Burr is arre.-ted for the crime, the public
readily assigns the motive of gain and
Madelon is not believed wtien she confesses
the truth. Madelon implores Lot to re
! veal the facts aixi save an innocent man.
Lot refuses and Ban resolves to suffer for
the girl, to whom he had been so incon
siderate. Finally Lot, to save Madelon.
writes a confession of suicide and brings
his life to a speedy end. Burr and Madelon
marry. The atorv is intended to stiow that

different from all the other books in that
it does not seek to prove some particular

\tSKsÃMflÂ¥h>v True Manhood by Electricityâ
WiÃsyK^v \/j Reasons Why Dr. Sanden's E'.ec-
lk3|fy*f|Â§|^^'V* " -ZjT trie Belt Is the Only Sure Remedy
TÂ©n2^^^^^,^^j^/3r â¢ * or the Recovery of This Vital
Vhat a great amount of happiness is destroyed by this
terrible drain which is called Nervous Debility ! You see the
evidences of it in the faces of more than half the people you
meet.
This great country of ours is a nation of nerves ; nerves
which have been drained of their vital force ; nerves which are
crying out for help. And why don't we help them? Why don't
we replace the energy which has been stolen from them ' ?"
Because the medical profession, to whom we always go in
time of sickness, has no means at hand to restore nerve power.
Drugs never build up, weak nerves without taking the strength
from other organs of the body.
That don't pay. You might as well be sick one way as
another. If you are going to steal from your kidneys, your liver
and your stomach the energy to give temporary nourishment to
your nerves you'd better better let your nerves suffer and save
your stomach anyway.
"I'm tired of drugging." We hear that remark every day.
It's the wail of the nerveless man who has lost all confidence in
the old, worn-out system of medicine.
"1 was nervous and broken down from debility. Along in the afternoon I would
get so tired and weak that I could not finish my day's work. A month after I began
to wear your Belt my strength had fully returned, and since then I have been as well
and strong as ever in my life." ED. M. PIERCE,
. -Vv Guadaloupe Dairy, 15th Avenue and San Bruno Road, San Francisco.
That shows you what Electricity does. Fowler, the noted
phrenologist, says it's the instrumentality of all life. â¢
Dr. Sanden'e Belt is a simple thing. You wear it about
three hours at night. You feel electricity going into your nerves
all the time. You can iegulate it yourself ; turn it on mild or
strong. Every minute you soak up nerve power from it.
. Even electricity is useless if not intelligently applied. â¢- Dr.
Sanden has devoted twenty years to close study of the nerve and
sexual forces, and even if other belts fail his treatment will cure.
Cheap, clumsily m*de electric belts are like cheap jewelry.
You think you are getting a high-class article at a low price, but
your experience tells you that you pay twice for what you get.
"I bought your Belt January 3 and have used it just a month. Previous to that
time I was so weak that I could not work. I commenced to gain in health and strength,
immediately upon application of the Belt, and to-day I can attend to my business and
take my station in life like a man. I owe it all to your Belt and take pleasure in'
recommending it." *" C. C. HELTMAN, Santa Barbara, CaL

AT THE THEATRES
THE Ptranpe Adventures of Miss
Brown" is not exactly a farce
comedy that scintillates with
genius, but it is bright and enter- \
taining. More than that, it tells 3 ;
tangible tale in dialogue, and is not merely '
a string of clumsy v<-gs on which to hang j
third and fourcii rate vaudeville perform- I
ances. Strange to say, the public in this
<ity seems to prefer farce-comedies that
are mere excuses for vaudeville shows. It
is hard to say why this should be so, for
the Orpheum gives a better variety show
than any farce-comedy organization can
afford to offer. There are expenses of
statre management, etc., con
nected with a theatrical company, even if
it is a theatrical company only in name,
which makes it unprofitable to engage as i
good all-round vaudeville stars as a regu
lar music-hall organization can present.
We have been so dosed with Dad singing |
and worse aancing, under the name of
farce-comedy, that "The Strange Advent
ures of Miss Brown" at the Baldwin comes ,
as a refreshing relief.
The modern stage-manager gets in more
of his deadly work every year. Plays are
constantly becoming more spectacular
and realistic, tanks are bigger, machinery
is more complicated and millinery and
smart frocks are rapidly becoming of more
importance than good p.'ays and clever
acting. But what a boon the stage
manager would confer upon dramatic art,
if he could be induced to restrict his efforts
to new plays and to melodramas! No one
would grudge him those, Tor generally
Bpeaking they are not worth rescuing irom
his clinches. Bat alas! the stage-manager,
the milliner and the modiste are slowly
but insidiously encroaching on all that
is sacrea in the drama, though of the
preat plays Goethe's "Faust" has hitherto
suffered most at their hands.
There is scope In "Faust" for spectacular
display, but the line should be drawn
somewhere, and that somewhere assuredly
. is at illuminating the flowers in Margue
rite's garden with incandescent lights.
Could anything be mere banal and vulgar?
One thinks at once of a superior sort of
beer-garden, or at best exposition-grounds,
with a military band playing and electric
fountains somewhere ia the background.
All the illusion of quaint medieval Nurem
burg is shattered by this fin de siecle inno
vation, as completely as if Marguerite
chewed gum or Faust interrupted hislove
roaking to order cocktails for two.
It's Morrison's "Faust" that they are
playing at the Columbia; the name of
Goethe does not fipure anywhere on the
programme. The public is informed who
supplied the electric light, who made the
costumes, who directs the destiny of the
calcium glow, but the man who wrote the
play is not worth mentioning. It is just
as well, perhaps. In another and a better
world Goethe might jangle his harp and
play harsh discords if this particular Mor
rison production of "Faust"' were brought
prominently to his notice; but how indig
nant we should be if foreigners ignored
our American geniuses in thai way. Sup
pose Berlin managers took it into their
heads to produce works written by men
on this side of the Atlantic and excluded
the names of the original writers to glorify
those of their own countrymen. We should
feel out and injured if we saw that Herr
yon Piltzner's "Robin Hooi" was quite tbe
rage in Berlin or that the Baron yon Pret
zel's laughable comedy "A Trip to China
town" was the hit of the theatrical season
in the Fatherland, and there is no doubt
that we should question whether the
Herrs and the Baron's adaptations were
scintillating enough to blot out tbe names
of the original writers. It is the modern
tendency, however, both in plays and
music, to give credit to the gentlemen who
make the adaptations or transcriptions
and give little or none to the original
writers, so Morrison, who has three
"Faust" companies on the road, is quite
abreast with the times.
Baldwin Theater.
"The Strange Adventures of Miss
Brown" will form the bill for the Baldwin
Theater to-night as well as for the rest of
the week. Variety will be introduced into
the performance by seasoning the play
with some songs. These will include a

Pacie, Amelia Btoue, J. Aldnch Libby and
Madeline Lack.
Columbia Theater.
The Morrison company's production of
"Faust" will remain the attraction of the
Columbia Theater for another week. One
of the features of the production is the
number of scenic effects produced by
numerous electrical appliances. Particu
larly in the Brocken scene does the electric
fluid play an important part.
Wednesday evening will mark the first
anniversary of the opening of the Colum
bia Theater under its present manage

mund Collier will appear in the leading
role of a modern melodrama, entitled
"Tne Cross Roads of Life." The part he
takes is that of the captain of a life-saving
crew, and around him and the persecuted
heroine the villains weave a plot of dis
aster, which keeps the audience on the
tenter-hooks of expectation to know how
virtue is finally to be triumphant.
The hero finally solves the problem of
his destiny ana protects Ihe heroine in a
manly and truly melodramatic fashion.
The good and bad traits in tbe characters
loom up with monumental prominence,
and it is said that in tne role of the cap
tain Edmund Collier finds a role .that is
thoroughly congenial to nis powers. Miss
Lisie Leigh will .appear as the heroine,

permits her to indulge in songs and
! dances.

pear for the first time here Miss Isadora
Duncan, a young Californian, who left
this City about a year ago for New York.
Very few were aware of her intention in
going East, and will be surprised to see
her return on the stage. Miss Duncau
joined one of Augustin Daly's companies
upon her arrival, and has been with him
since. She made a hit in the French pan
tomime, "Miss Pygmalion," with her
grace. ul posing and dainty dancing. Her
dance in "A Midsummer Night's Dream,"
which is billed for the second week, is
original, as in fact is all of her work. She
will also dance in "Twelfth Night."
Miss Duncan is a daughter of Mrs. Dora
Gray Duncan, who is well known here, be
ing an old San Franciscan, so there will
be a pleasant reception accorded her on
her arrival.
A Loyal Californian.
Holbrook Bltnn, the young San Fran
cisco actor who has won so much praise
from press and public alike, writes thus
from Grand Rapids, Mich., concerning his
travels for the past three years: "I have
seen almost the whole country and our
own eolden State and our own Golden
Gate are unsurpassed. I have loitered
under the drowsing palms of Hawaii and
bathed in the waters of its coral-reefed
shores; I have sailed among the icebergs
that girt the waters of Alaska and
summered in that flowerless land,
I have wandered among the tropic ver
dure-hung forests of the South, and
climbed the classic mountains of Vermont;
I have gazed ir fixed admiration at the
beautiful entrance to Charleston harbor
and stood enraptured as the sun sank be
hind the reef at St. Augustine; but there
is no lend like my land; no valieys so
sweet as our valleysâ with their swift
flowing, cold streams, that sing canyon
songs as they rush onward to the low
lands; 1 have seen all the great harbors of
this country, but have yet to be so near
the perfect as when looking westward,
crossing our own bay, I see the great gate
and the limitless Pacific beyond. The re
gret of a lifetime is in exile from this gar
den of the worldâ dear, old California. I
am counting tbe days till the season's
close, to be within her portals once again."
ASTONISHED CHICAGO.
A Wild, Weird Drama by Sir Henry
Irving's Son.
A romantic one-act play, "Godefroi and
Yolande," by Lawrence Irving, son of Sir
Henry Irving, has caused considerable
comment in Chicago. The drama was
produced for the first time on any stage in
the Windy City the other day, by the
Irving- Terry company. Miss Terry plays
Yolaude, but Sir Henry does not appear
in the performance. The New York Her
ald, speaking of this work, says:
" 'Godefroi and Yolande' is a grewsome
medieval play, the story of a French
courtesan hi^h in royal favor, who, in the
midst of her life of splendid vice, is stricken
with leprosy and cast out among the os
tracised colony.
"She has held a very court cf her own,
magnificent in its appointments, daring in
its shamelessness, royal in its personnel.
In her household is a youth, Godefroi,
who loves her â with what playwrights are
pleased to call a pure love. His mother
comes to Yolande's castle and endeavors
to open his eyes to his infatuation and in
duce him to leave, but is driven away by
Yolande.
"Preparations are being made for a grand
bal masque, which tho king is to attend,
and though Yolande is ill she joins the
guests. At the bail the king is told by one
who has been much in the East and has
learned to quickly detect symptoms of
leprosy that he has touched the hand of
a masked guest who is infected, and warns
the king of his peril. There is a scene of
tumult, and the suspected leper, being at
last compelled to unmask, is found to be
Yolamle.
"Cast out, she wanders among the
lepers, followed only by Godefroi, who
sacrifices himself in order to be her com
panion and her savior. He labors with
what his mother declares is a spirit that
is surely Christlike to work Yolando's
spiritual redemption, to save the soul of
the woman he loved, though the body is
Tust all cure. And this he does, bringing
Yolande finally to repentance for her past
and to making peace with her God."
I.aokaj <-'i New Play.
Wilton Lackaye, who made such a suc
cers as Svengali in "Trilby, 1 proposes to
star. He has several plays he intenls to
produce, but the most important is one
entitled "Dr. HelÃraff," of which Charles
Kiein, tbe librettist of "El Capitan," is the
author.
Dr. Belgraff, like Svengali, is a hypno
tist, and he uses his power to conceal a
murder he has committed. Remorse
seizes him, however, and he takes to
drink. Weakened by dissipation, he gradu
ally loses his hypnotic influence and his
secret is betrayed. Rather than pay the
penalty of hi 9 crime he swallowed a
draught of poison and the play ends as he
falls dead.
Rather a grewsome affair, is it not? But
Mr. Lackaye says it is a very strong play
and that he feels of its success. He
may possibly give it a trial production
somewhere this sprintr, but he intends to
open his starring tour in the "West, and
will not brine his play into New York un
til he has ii in perfect working order.
AUGISTIN DALY.
Career of a Man "Who Has Done Much
for the Drama.
Born at Plymouth, N. C, July 20, 1838.
and educated in Norfolk, Va., with some
finishing touches put on in New York
City, Auguistin Daly is claimed as a South
ern man, though New York and the Na
tion now claim him, and is proud of him
for what he has done for the stage end
dramatic literature. He became dramatic
editor of the New York Sunday Courier in
18(59, and successfully held positions on
the Express, Citizen, Times and Sun un
til he became a manager of theaters by
opening the old Fifth-avenue Theater.
To him was due the production of Henry
Mosenthal's "Deborah" in America, and
the brilliant success of Miss Kate Bate
man in the well-remembered character of
Leah the Forsaken, thirty-two years
ago. While yet a youth he adapted plays
for Mrs. John Wood, Mme. Methua-
Scheller, Rose Eytinge and Avonia Jones.
He was the earliest adopter of Charles
Reade's "Griffith Gaunt," and he had a
principal hand in converting Henry Ward
Beecher's novel of " Norwood" into a
play, in days when the name of Beecher
was a watchword for the public enthu
siasm. As a writer of original dramas he
was very early in the field. His melo
drama of "Under the Gaslight," produced
in 1807, containing the rescue from death
upon the railroad track, proved the pre
cursor of a long line of sensational plays
upon American subjects. His "Flasn of
lightning," in 1868, was another success
in the same field, and his play of "Pique"
still continues to be the best of American
domestic dramas.
During his first season as* a manager,
that of 1869-70, when he had to contend
against the rivalry of Booth's Theater and
of WallacK's, he produced twenty-three
plays, of which three were by Shakespeare,
and every one of his revivals was consci
entiously planned and sumptuously ac
complished. He presented that fine trage
dian E. L. Davenport when at bis best.
He brought out Mrs. Scott-Siddons in
Shakespearean tragedy and comedy at a
time when that lovely woman was in the
prime of her beauty. He managed en
gagements of John Brougham. Georpe L.
Fox, Edwin Booth, Joseph Jefferson, E. A.
Sothern, Mile. Aimee, Adelaide Neilson,
Charles Mathews and Fechter. He was
the first to present the noble Spanish play
of "Yorick in 1874, and he introduced
the first of the comedies of Bronson How
ard. He discovered and fostered the tal
ents of Clara Morris, Agnes Bethel, Fanny
Davenport, Catherine Lewis, Kate Cla.x
ton, Sara Jewett, James Lewis and John
Drew, and it is to his wise guidance and
bojd enterprise that the public owes its
enjoyment of the genius and success of
Aua Rehan. His revivals of old comedy
and his presentations of the plays of
Shakespeare are among the most careful,
tasteful and beautiful that have been ac
complished.
He has started and established three
theaters in New York, has conducted pros
perous performances all across the conti
nent, on the Pacific Coa*t and in Germany
and France, and he has performed the
almost incredible feat of establishing a
new theater In the city of London.
This is a remarkable career, and it is a
career honorable to the manager and use
ful and impressive to society, and while
brilliant with eood deeds well done it is
augury of much beneficent achievement in
the maturity and repose of developed
powers and assured repute.
Dramatic Brevities.
Mrs. Henry E. Abbey contemplates re
turning to the stage next season.
Henry Jrving's American tour closes in
New York Friday night. May 15.
Henry Dixey has been re-engaged for
next season by Charles Frohman to play
tue principal part in "Thoroughbred."
They are publishing in Paris alleged
extracts from a book by Bernhardt about
Americans. The extracts so far as heard
from are all complimentary, so it may be
merely a compilation from Bernbardi's
newspaper interviews.
On the 24th inst. a local Italian opera
company, under the direction of Professor
Paniza and Professor Martinez, will give
"Cxitpino c la Comare" at the Bush-street
Theater. Anjonii the soloists will be Mrs.
Cuneo McLean, Mrs. Douglas, and Signori
Paniza, Almapia, De Grazia, Bcrtini,
Grella and Daniele.
Miss Apnes Simpson, who is said to be a
perfect type of Trilby beauty, will on
Saturday, the 16th inst., sing for the first
time in this City the Chopin impromptu
which Trilby is supposed to have sung in
her hypnotic state. The success of the
book caused some Paris publishers to have
the pianoforte solo transcribed for the
voice.
Herr Fritz Scheel, the leader of the
Olympia Concert Orchestra, has been in
vited to direct a symphony concert, which
will probably taVe place at the Carnegie
Music Hall on Friday afternoon, May 15.
The orchestra will Decomposed of seventy
five musicians selected from the Philhar
monic and Symphony societies.
Miss Ada Rehan intends to go to Europe
early in July and will spend her vacation
at her summer house in Cumberland,
England, on the Irish Sea. The other
members of the company, most of whom
are re-engaged for next season, will spend
their time as they choose until the middle
ol August at least.
H. A. Jones has called the piece which
he has written for Mr. Willard "The
Rogue's Comedy." The play is in three
acts, and the part which will be played by
Mr. Willard is that of a gentleman who
puts into practice on every occasion some
peculiar theories on the subject of honesty.
Here is a story of father and son. It was
the premiere of a new play by the younger
Dumas, and Dumas pere was loitering in
rhe vestibule of the theater. "Had you a
hand in this?" asked a friend of the vet
eran. "Yes," he replied. '-For what were
you responsible?" "I am responsible for
the author." he observed, and passed on.
A peculiar custom prevalent in Mexico
is that of selling a ticket for a single act of
a play. One nmy see ati entire play by
purchasing a large ticket with a coupon
for each act, which gives a sitting in the
best rows of the orchestra circle, reserved
for this purpose. A ticket for only one
act involves a seat outside this charmed
circle, and its holder is expected to retire
voluntarily at the end of the act or pay
again.
Hermann Sudermann, the author of
"Magda," is described by the Berlin cor
respondent of the New York Tribune as
still a comparatively young man, having
just passed his thirty-eighth year. His
tinely shaped head and lectures and his
long black beard give him a very hand
some appearance, and at tir&t glance one
would not take him for a German. He
has more of the Southerner in his looks,
and there are a freedom and a joviality in
his manner and conversation that are
very utilise the Prtibsian character, but
make him most pleasant to meet.

.EDITED BY MARY W. KICHAKDS
FROM the land of sunshine and |
roses, the "Garden City" of the I
West, fair San Jose, a greeting to- I
day I send to my little readers. I '
am keeping my eyes and ears wide
open during this "nierrie carnival" time
for interesting things to tell my boys and
girls in the future.
I hope you a!l agree with me that the
"Naughty Max" stories which were
eelected for publication are very interest
ing ones.
What Flora Saw When in Soarch of the
Fairies.
[CONCLUDED.]
I am perfectly discouraged, mamma, at
the turn of affairs, but I am going to make
one more effort, and if I don't succeed I
"Stop, Carlo," said Flora; "yon arc walking right into that spider's web."
Bbsll come to the conclusion that if fairies
ever did exi3t they have now become ex
tinct.
This morning I intend to question the
various insects and animals that 1 may
chance to meet, and when I return I shall
tell you with what success.
Carlo was frisking around showing his
impatience to be off for the usual morning
ramble, and Flora's low whistle sent him
bounding down the road. "Not quite so
f.ist, old doggie, or we shall lose all our
opportunities.
"Why, even now I see a trusty subject,
but aias it would take an Australian bee
hunter to gather any information from
that little fellow! How busy he was! And
what a load of pollen he had, carrying it
home, from which to make his honey.
"Surely he knows nothing of fairies, he
is far too busy with his own affairs.
"Never mind, we don't expect much to
day, so our hearts will be light in spite of
repeated failures.
"But stop. Carlo, you are walking right
"It's Only Pussy."
into that spider's web! There now, keep
still, and we shall see whether or uot we
can find the owner of this mansion."
Flora peeped cautiously around, but the
spider was not visible.
"We fchall leave him a note asking for
an interview on our return," said she, as
she threw a tiny bit of paper into his web.
Immediately om ran "Lord bpider" and
pounced vi on his supposed prey. Great
was his indignation when he discovered
that he had been tricked! But he care
fully disentangled the paper, threw it out
and returned to his hiding-place.
"Ho chance here,"' said Flora. "Unfor
tunately I have provoked the little fellow,
so we had better Jeave him now and re
turn when he has recovered his Â«ood hu
mor."
"Such a lovely morning this is! All the
world seems to be singing. It matters
little to me whether fairies exist or not;
* surely my life is a very happy one, and
there is really no wish I need ask of the
fairies!" thought the little girJ. Butail the
tame just then she cried to Carlo: "Well,
you naughty dojr. how dare you do so?
ihe aea of chasinc that squirrel! Do
you not know that we are in search of in
formation and should be particularly
friendly to everything?
"Easy now," as she motioned the doe to
stand still, while she slipped carefully up
to a beautiful wild rosebush, on one of
whose lovely blooms daintily poised a
brilliant swallow-tailed butterfly.
But the hearing of this beauty seemed
equal to the sight of Argus; for before
Flora could speak ho had spread his gaudy
wings and flew away to lind new fields of
honeyed sweetness.
"Come, Carlo; it was through no fault of
yours that we failed, but I am sure that
butterfly must be related to the fairies, be
cause his movements are so light and airy
and his beauty so delicate."
Just then Flora gave a terrific shriek
and nearly jumped over Carlo. In her
rapturous admiration of the butterfly she
had not looked before her, and had nearly
walked into thefriendlj of a large
gopher snake.
When she had regained her composure
she laughingly said to her dog, who was
yet barking at this formidable enemy,
"Well. Carlo, this is the first time you
have been willing to interview anything,
and 1 assure you you are most welcome to
any information you may glean from his
snakeship."
They strolled along for some time, en
joying the beautiful flowers and the sing
ing birds, and the little girl became almost
forgetful of her mission when whiz, bip,
and her right eye wa3 closed in an instant,
the shock being followed by a terrible
pain !
After a few moments of agony Flora
succeeded in wiping from her eye a gnat.
"Oh, you mischief-maker ! You were very
tiny, but you made yourself feel like a
mountain. From your swift flight I really
believe you were the winged steed from
fairyland, and I am truly sorry that you
came to so untimely an end, for 1 should
dearly have loved to question you."
Flora becan to think that the third day
of her quest was to bring nothing but mis
fortune, so she called her dog and started
for home.
When she arrived there she threw her
self on the cool shady porch at her
mother's feet saying, "Mother, dear, Carlo
and I have enjoyed ourselves thoroughly
the last few days, for we have seen much
that I ?hall remember for a long time, and
while I am convinced that there are no
fairy folk nowadays, still I do not advise
any little girl to tako my word alone for
it, but hope they will all search for fairy
land as I have, and I trust with as much
enjoyment." Alice Sill,
[the end.]
The Little Gogfllp*.
"Have you heard what that sly hypocrite
Rosella Hayes has done?" said Celeste to
her three little playmates, Daisy, Florence
and Christabella. "I could hardly believe
it, and I feel so angry I shall never play
with her again."
"What has ehe done, Celeste?" cried the
three little friends with the utmost curi
osiiy. "Why, we always thought Rosella
such an honorable girl!"
"Honorable!" cried Celeste, with a dis
dainful shrug of her shoulders. "Well
what you think of this? i made a heart
shaped pincushion as a Christmas gift to
our nchoolteacher (all the girls are to give
her a present), and it looked so pretty,
made of white muslin and lace; I know
that old hypocrite has gone to work and
made one exactly like mine, only tiers is
blue saiin, and, of course, much prettier;
so I suppose I may as well throw mine
away, after all my trouble. Is it not
shameful?"
"Disgraceful!" cried Daisy. "I hate a
sly girl," said Florence. "I have always
suspected her oF beirig a hypocrite," added
Chnstabel; "but really this i* too bad!"
cried the four little gossips, all at once.
How little they knew of the surprise in
store for them!
That same evening a parcel and note
from Rosella Hayes were handed in to
Celeste. The note ran as follows:
D;ar Celeste: I hope you will like this little

blue satin pincushion. I have finished my
gift for our te cher. It is a little work-basket
lined with pink satin. Mother wishes you to
come "to tea" to-morrow evening, so "please
come. Your friend, Rubella.
Gelesiine's face flashed with shame.
Rosella had been making the blue satin
pincushion for her all the time she had
been talking so unkindly of her little
friend! In her distress she ran and told
her mother all about it.
"Well, my dear," said her mother kind
ly, "let this be n lesson to you in
the future. Never be hasty in form
ing an opinion upon the conduct
of others; think as kindly as you can of
all your playmates, and never say anything
mean about any one, v.'hich is a sad fault
in a woman."
Celeste thought over htr mother's words,
and since that day she has been a {rentier
and more amiable girl, while she and
Rosella are fast friends.

Naughty Max.
The little giri's name in the picture is
Helen anil the dogcie's name is Max.
Helen lives out in the country and has a
kind papa and mamma and is very much
petted by them as she is the only child.
Helen is just 5 years old, but her
mamma is never afraid when Max, her
little pet, is with her.
On her fifth birthday her aunty in New
York sent her a lovely doll with a pretty
red dress and hat of the latest style, and a
trunk full of a whole wardrobe for Miss
dollie. She was deliglitcd with it and
called the doll "Violet," her favorite name
for anything she loves. She played with
it all the next day, and when her mamma
called her and told her that Lucy, a friend
of hers, was there, she left Violet lying
on the bench near Max and ran to meet
her little friend.
Now, Max was jealous of Violet, and he
thought to himself: "This is a good
chance for me to put her out of the way."
So ne picked her up by the pretty red dress
and shook her as hard as lie couid. He
tore her dress all to pieces and lost her
pretty white slippers, then left her lying
on the ground with her nose broken.
In about twenty minutes Helen and
Lucy came out to see the doll and you may
imagine the poor little mamma's distress
at seeing that Violet had leen used so
badiy. At first she could do nothing but cry,
until her mamma came out and promised
her another dollie, and that comforted her.
Max was lying down a little way off In
the grass, but his young mistress picked
up poor Violet and went over to him and
gavt> him a lecture, which I am sure he
understood, for he dropped hia ears and
looked as if he felt very sorry. You see
Helen in the picture just scolding Max.
She now has another doll and is very
careful not to leave it alone with Max,
and 1 do not think he feels so jealous as
he did. At least he dÂ« es not seem to.

Naughty Max.
In the big city of New York there lived a
little girl, whose name was Dorothy Arnold,
fche had sunny brown curls and a pretty
dimpled face. Hue lived with her papa aud
mamma aud her papa's oldest sister, Aunt
Alice. One day when she was playing with
her doll, Geraldine, s-he saw nnughty Max, her
pet dog. frisking around and stopping to look
at her, as if to say, "Come, little mistress,
leave that stupid doll and have a frolic with
me." "No, no, naughty Maxy, I will not go
out to play with you, for you have been a
naughty dog and lore my poor little dolly no
that Aunt Alice had to glue her arm and sew
her up so the sewdust would not come out.
And I must make ncr a nignt cap and gown
and put her to bed so the glue will dry. 1 will
never let you play with my dolly again, you
are too rough. But I guess I will play with you
just a little while so dolly can go to sleep and
let the glue get dry.

Naughty Max.
"Now, Max, you stop your whining," said
Susie Grey to her pup. "I'll soon have you all
dressed and then I'll put you and Amelia Jane
in tne don-carriage and then we'll go to visit
Aunt Mary."
Amelia Jane was her doll. Susie had al
ready dressed her in ncr red dress and put on
her green silk bonnet, and now she was trying
to dress Max in an old white dress of Amelia
Jane's, but Max did not like to be dressed as it
was new to him.
"Now you are all dresscJ." said Susie an she
buttoned the last button; "now lie mill like a
good floggie while I get the Carriage."
It was too tight a fit for Amelia Jane and
Max to He side by side; so Susie put Max in
first and then put Amelia in his paws, i
with one paw around her nfcek.
"Doesn't Max hold Amelia Jane lovely? I
diln't think he'd t>e so good," said Susie to
her mother as she was tying on her hat.
"Good-by, mamma," said Susie, as she went
out of the "door, "we won't be gone long."
Susie had not gone far when she heard a
thump in the carriage and there was Max with j
Amelia Jane's arm in his mouth, her dress all â 
torn and his own dress split down the back.
"Oh. dear, it's all that pup's fault," wailed !
Susie; "you bad dog," she said, as she took him :
by the "back of his neck and put him on the '
sidewalk, "you deserve a good scolding." Now !
that Max was out of the carriage he started \
home as fast as he could and fcusie I
after him, but Max ran faster even
U his sleeves were tight and his !
dreÂ«s was long. Finally he ran toward a group
(>i newsboy!!, who began laughine then they I
saw him. One of the boys caught Max, and
when Susie came running up, very red in the
face, for it was a warm day, ha gave Max to :
her.
When Susie pot home about ten minutes !
later she told her mother all about it. "Never !
miud," said her mother, "I'll fix Amelia Jane I
ail right, and you'll know from experience
that dogs and dolls don t make gooa compan
ions."
Susie went to see Aunt Mary next day, but
Max did not go alone. Clara Kennedy.

little friend, Mabel, came for her to go straw
berrying with Iht. Millie at once threw Susan,
the doll, on the floor, and was off with Mabel.
"Good-by, mamma,' the sang, as she went
down the walk. "I will bring lots of straw

They were very happy with the amount of

to her on her birthday, which was in the
month of June. One day she was playing with
her doll in the parlor and having a good time.
I'retty soon her mamma called her to go on an
errand. She laid her doll, which she called
Alice, on a chair and ran to her mother. The
day was hot so Max, the dog, saw all the doors
open and walked into the parlor where his
mistress had been playing. He thought he
would have a good time too, so he seized the
doll and commenced to tear it up. His mis
tress soon came home and ran to get her doll
and put it away. As she stepped into the
room there was her doll all toru to pieces.
After all the fun Max got the worst of it. He
was shut up and not allowed to play with his
mistress again for a week. Yours truly,
Sweetland, Cal. Oscar axgilly.
The Little Girl and Her Dog.
I am Max, Maggie's dog, or rather I was her
doggie before that hateful doll came into the
house. 1 lived in "Frisco" with some other
doggies.- One day a lady came to our house
and said I was a nice doggie aud she would
like to take me to a little girl named Maggie,
in the country. So she put me in a basket ana
took me to Maggie. No doggie was as happy
as I was. But 1 pulled the doilies curls and
scratched her face. Now lam a lost dog and
have no home. To think 1 should be scolded

for that horrid doll. Odear! Odearl I'll go
off and drown myself if Maggie keeps that
doll. Max.

Naughty MÂ»x.
One day it was raining so that Carrie could
not go to school.
She played all the forenoon with her dog and
doll. The dog's name was Max; the doll's
name was Clara. Every morning Carrie used
to wash Max with Fear's soap and hot water.
â  Mnx did not like his treatment very well.
Bui Carrie did it so much that it made him
mad. so one morning Max paid to himself, "I
will pay her; I will tear her doll into rags."
While Carrie was sleeping that morning,
Max went to the doll's cradle and grabbed it
and began to tear it when Carrie woke up and
heard her doll crying for her. She ran and got
the doll from the dog, and then gave the dog a
good scolding. Max never toucned a doll after
that great scolding. James L. Harris.

THE GREAT DOCKYARDS
OF EUROPE.
THE failure of Congress to pass ap
propriations for the construction
of a Government dockyard on the
Pacific Coast, of greater extent
than that of Mare Island, hat
awakened the curiosity of many people as
to why these institutions should require
so much money and take such a long time
to complete. A modern steamship is un
doubtedly the highest point of man's
mechanical excellence and skill, and of all
steamships, the modern man-of-war is
the most costly and complicated. It is
necessarily complicated since it is built to
fight with, ana to fight successfully aga:n-t
masses of animated mm and steel, and it
must also insure the safety of the men
who are within it. And to make it a pro
tection against the armor piercing projec
tiifs thrown out from guns with immense
velocity and power requires that it should
be covered itself with an armor of material
s.i hani and iirm ami clastic that the steel
of the Toledo or Damascus swords areas
nothing to it.
Then this immense mass must be swift
ly propelled and made to stop quickly and
to turn about very short, to move in every
direction, and it must have within itself
the means of generating all the necessary
power. It must for safety be divided into
many partitions, and yet so arranged that
while the apertures between apartments
can be quickly opened, they niay be as
quickly closed in danger. There must be
perfect communication between all parts
of this wonderful machine, so that like the
arms or feet on the body obeying the will
the various members of the ship answer
instantaneously to the brain of the com
mander. And within itself must be the
means of self-sustenance for a considerable
time, while added to all the foregoing
requisites is the most important of all,
that of being able to fight by every means,
with either guns, torpedoes or its own im
pact.
To manufacture such a wonder requires
many machines and very costly ones,
many buildings for making the various
parts, much land for the storage of
material and much space to build the
monster itself in. A brief description of
the principal dockyards of Europe will
throw some light on this question of ex
pense. It must be remembered that in the
ship-building establishments in America
it is impossible to build a modern battle
ship short of two years, and when there
fore it is asked of Congress that money
shall be given for eight or ten such vessels
it wifl require with our present facilities
four or five years to complete the work.
Of course, at the head of all powers
England stands with her dockyards as
with her navy. Not only has" she tbe
greatest number, but she has the largest,
the best equipped, and can turn out the
greatest number of warships and in the
quickest time. Some of them are situated
abroad in her colonial possessions, but
they are for the purpose of repair, while
the great ones for building are all in Great
Britain. They are at Pembroke, Devon
port and Keyham. Portsmouth, Chatham
and Sheerness. On these dockyards there
has been an immense amount of money
spent â many times over the value of them
as they stand, whioh is estimated at $140,
000,000. In building them much of the
"abor has been done by convicts, so that
)he cost might be put down as low as pos
lible. Here are employed as many men as

and these men are paid over $8,000,000 a
year in wages.
The greatest of all the dockyards belong
ing to the Government is that of Ports
mouth. It contains 300 acres, has over
6000 employes, five building slips for ves
sels of the largest size and fifteen dry
docks of varying sizes from the largest to
the smallest. These drydocks and basins
are all connected with wide and deep
canals and basins in which many vessels
may be laid for repairs. The dockyard at
Chatham is the second in the Kingdom,
has about 5400 employes and covers over
100 acres. The map on this page of The
Call gives in detail the Portsmouth yards
with their various buildings, basins and
docks. It was at this yard that the Col
lingwood, the Camperdown, the Colossu?,
the Edinburgh and maoy other of the
nS'liFirr W.R Hamilton
greatest and finest of Britain's ships were
built
This great yard is considered the head
quarters or general rendezvous of the Brit
ish fleet. It was founded by Henry VII,
and was a very important naval station
even in the early Plantagenet times. In
IJIl' the Sheriff of Southampton was
ordered to cause the docks at Portsmouth
to be inclosed with a strong wall, in the
manner in which the archdeacon of Taun
ton would point out, for the preservation

of the King's ships and galleys. In 1540
the area of the yard seems to bave been
about eight acres and fronted on the har
bor on a portion of what is now known as
the King's Stairs. Cromwell added two
acres to It and Charles II added eighteen
Between 1667 and 1710 thirty acres were
reclaimed from mud flats and additional
ground bought from the town, so that by
1712 it comprised ninety acres, but about
1840 the growth of a steam navy occa
sioned additional land, and from that time
\ to this there has been a steady growth in
size and capacity.
At present the system of docks and ba
sins begins with a tidal basin, entered
from the harbor by an opening 100 yards
wide and having a depth at low tide of
thirty feet. There is a deep dock and two
locks at the head of this basin with twenty
eight feet of water at low tide. The locks

are themselves splendid docks, capable of
receiving the heaviest warships from the
tidal basin. They lead to the repairing ba
sin, which is an artificial pond or lake
with twenty-two acres and thirty-five feet
of water at high tide. This depth of water
can be made permanent by the closing of
the lock gates. From this basin lead out
four other basins or docks with a deptli of
thirty feet of water. There Is a rigging
basin of fourteen acres and a pentagon
shaped fitting-out basin of fourteen acres,
on one side of which is an immense coal
ing station.
There are other basins and docks, and
around all are immense fortifications. In
side are the many storehouses and various
shops and mills, "while a complete network
of railways connects all parts of the yard
with the docks and basins, and the whole

with the neighboring railroads to all parts
of the kingdom, so that iron or coal can
be taken from the mills and furnaces clone
to the mines and in the course of a few
hours brought without change to the side
of the ship in which it is to be used.
The Pembroke dockyard is the best
adapted for building operations. It com
prises some seventy-seven acres and has
eleven building-slips, which are covered by
substantial sbiphouses. It has, however,
but one dock and no basins, and but few
sliops and stores, and cannot be used as a
fitting-out station. The dockyards at Key
ham and Uevonport are really one. They
contain in the aggregate 140 acres and are
connected by a tunnel, through which a
railway has been laid, and locomotives be
longing to the yards transfer men and ma
terial from one yard to the other. The
building-siips and most of the drydocks
are in Devonport, while the shops and fit
ting-out basins are in the Keyham yard.
A curiosity to bo seen in Devonport is a
huge floating platform in the drydock and
intended to be submerged and used to
float out vessels while under repair.
All the other dockyards in Great Britain
are secondary to those mentioned, except
ing, of course, several belonging to private
firms.
The principal dockyards belonging to
foreign powers are as follows: Germany-
Kiel, Dantzic, Wilhelmshafen. Russiaâ
Cronstadt, St. Petersburg, Nicholaieff
and Sebastopol. Austriaâ Pola and Trieste.
Denmark â Copenhagen. France âCher
bourg, Brest. L'Orient, Toulon and Roche
fort. Spainâ Cadiz, Cartagena. Italy-
Naples, Spezzia and Castellamare.
The yard at Vilhelmshafen is on the
North Sea, while Kiel and Dantzic are on
the Baltic. That of Kiel is the most im
portant, and most of Germany's great
ships have been built there. Over $24,000,
000 has been spent on this yard, with its
basins, locks and docks. The great North
Sea canal, the magnificent harbor of Kiel,
ten miles long and very deep, and the
splendid fortifications surrounding the
yards, make this one of the best located
and best adapted yards in the world.
In Russia the dockyards of St. Peters
burg and Cronstadt are on the Baltic, the
others on the Black Sea. A new yard is
being built which promise* ta eclipse all i
the others. It is in tbe province of Circas
sia and fifty miles from the Black Sea, on
the straits joining that body to the sea of
Azof.
The most important of the French dock
yards is that of L'Orient, in the northern
part of the Bay of Biscay. Its environ
ment resembles that of Portsmouth, N.
H. There is also a large military station
here, and the entire yard is about 120
acres in extent.
Cherbourg is the most imposing of the
French dockyards. It has a number of
basins and drydocks, but it is an artificial
port and has a very exposed situation. A
very extensive breakwater with strong
fortifications protects it from the sea, !
while it is also fortified by land ap- j
proaches. The yard possesses no natural ,
situation or advantages, and owes its
origin to Napoleon 1, under whose direc
tion many of the present works were
begun and prosecuted in the face of enor
mous difficulties. The yard contains 260
aores, has eleven slips, eight drydocks and
three basins, besides numerous shops and
buildings. The basins are excavated from
solid reck, and are faced and coped with
massive granite. The slips have perma
nent shipnouses. The quays, basins and
slips which characterize the French yards
are all of such permanent and massive
character that if duplicated in the United
States would cost us not less than $300,
000,0u0.
It will thus be seen from the foregoing
details the value the powers of Europe
place on their dockyards. Yet in our
country, outside of several private yards,
the entire cost of our dockyards may be
placed at $10,000,000. There is in all the
world no place more fit by natural advan
tages than the harbor and surroundings of
San Francisco for a dockyard. And it
would pay tne Government over and over
again to erect drydocks of the largest size,
with basins and building slips at Mare
Island, which can be absolutely protected
from any outside enemy. The coal of Wel
lington and Puget Sound, and the iron of
California, with the timber, are all so con
venient that without a change it can be
brought right to this yard and converted
into ships of war. A large Government
foundry for supplying both army and navy
with high-power guns should be erected
under the same conditions at Benicia Ar-
I senal, and there is bat little doubt that the
first real war we have will see the accom
plishment of these two projects.

Just Ended a Pilgrimage on i- not.
The St. Petersburg Gazette says Russia
has the oldest roan on earth. ltd Moscow
correspondent tells of him thus:
There appeared this week in the office of
the police surgeon an aged man who
wished to have his injured band bandaged.
The surgeon bound up the wound and
then began talking with tbe patient.
He learned eventually, from document
ary evidence, that the man was born
in 1757, during the reign of Em
press Elizabeth, and therefore is 139
years old. The old man, whose name
is Kusmin, said he was a native of Mos
cow, and from his twentieth to his eighty
sixth year had been a coachman. In l.is
eighty-sixth year, however, he had upset
his roaster, a Count, and tbe Count's
brother, had burt both seriously and had
been sent to Siberia, where he bad lived
until 1893. In that year he decided to re
turn home, and he arrived in Moscow in
1894. He at once started for Kieff on a
pilgrimage, from which he had just come
back. He was much grieved to find that
all the friends of his youth were dead.
"Kusmin's eyesight is undimmed, his
hearing is good and he is a splendid
walker, as his pilgrimages have shown.
Up to his one hundred and thirty-fourth
year he never tasted whisky, but now be

YOUNG
ATHLETE.
LAST week I began a series of arti
cles oa athletics. There I spoke
on athletic honor and prelimi
nary work. The next thing to be
considered is Diet.
It is impossible to overestimate the im
portance of proper eating and drinking.
Most people eat too fast; in fact, it is the
one great characteristic of Americans. It
must be remembered that the food, even
milk, must be thoroughly mixed with the
saliva before it is swallowed, or the gastric
juice in the stomach may not be able to
perform the duty assigned to it.
It must be kept strictly in mind that a
man has not a stomach like a boa-con
strictor; he cannot swallow his food whole
and expect it to take care of itself. My
dentist recently stated that my teeth
showed unmistakable signs of hard usage,
especially the molars, and to that cause I
ascribe my excellent digestion, for I grind
everything fine before I swallow. More
over, I eat slowly, even at the risk of being
the last to finish in company.
In this connection two things should be
borne in mind : First, that the food is de
signed to nourish the body, not to tickle
the appetite; second, care should be taken
that it does not cause trouble after it is
down. Suppose you build \& fire and it
smokes, what does it mean? Simply that
there is imperfect combustion â that the
fuel is smoldering, not blazing and giving
out heat as it should.
Now there is a sense in which the
stomach can smoke â that is , you can take
a great deal of food in the system that will
pass along without nourishing the blood.
This 18 a serious matter, and tne subject
of dieting should be carefully studied by
the ambitious athlete.
Perhaps I cannot take a better time than
tbe present to impress a principle upon
the aspiring athlete and to say person
ally :
You must study yourself closely. Re
member that while physicians and trainers
can do a great deal in pointing out your
weaknesses and help you remedy them,
it is impossible to know how you
feel, and physicians will tell you that feel
ing is everything in diagnosing a case â
that is, to analyze it. Great athletes
know themselves as no doctor or trainer
can possibly Know them. In this respect
the first year is always hardest
on the racer because he has symp
toms, aches and pains that he does not
understand. Perhaps he will imagine he
has heart disease; or dream he is going
into quick consumption. To-day he will
have Britrbt's disease, and to-morrow it
will be white swelling in the Km-e. But
nevermind all these things; pursue the
even tenor of your way and do not be dis
turbed by trifles. I would strongly sug
gest that physiology and hygiene be
studied, until all the muscles and vitals
are understood, their functions and their
weaknesses thoroughly known.
You would like to know how soon after
eating you may exercise. Now that de
pends a great deal upon the person. Some
people can actually race for a mile or so
within an hour after a good meal, but I
could not; it was necessary for me to have
two hours and a half at the least before 1
would be fit for a race. This is a matter
each athlete should decide for himself.
You would like to know how much you
should eat. That depends largely on the
individual, also. Some people suffer
greatly if they eat too much, or even if
they hitvc what is generally known as a
square meal. It is necessary for such peo
ple to be very careful, and stop eating
before they feel that they have had enough.
On the contrary, there are some who
can eat a great deal and not mind it. One
person of my acquaintance can eat in such
a way as to gauge pretty accurately when
he will be hungry again. If he has a mod
erate meal he knows that it will be five
hours before he will be hungry. If he
eats quite heartily it will be six hours be
fore he will feel the necessity of food. But
if he eats until he begins to feel uncom
fortable he can go for seven hours without
being distressed by huuger. This is ac
counted for by perfect assimilation of the
food.
"What shall I eat?" is a question that is
frequently asked by the beginner; but it is
a large question and not easily answered in
the space at my command. Perhaps I can
give a satisfactory substitute in a few
words. Eat that which is wholesome and
use your own good sense in the matter.
Fried and greasy articles should be
avoided.
There was in my acquaintance a young
man who was going to take part in a very
important race. A friend observed him
at dinner and was struck with astonish
ment at his diet so close to the contest.
On questioning the young athlete the
friend discovered that he ate pretty much
what was placed before him at the table.
This upset all the friend's theories on
the subject of dieting in training. It
is a fact, however, that home cook
ing is about as good dieting as one could
wish, if the digestion is in good order and
the aspirant is careful to study the sub
ject. This does not mean that it is ad
missible to eat all sorts of stuff that any
body with common-sense would know is
"EVERY ATHLETE HAS SOME IMAGINARY COMPLAINT."
[Drawn by a "Call" staff artist.]
wrong, such as mince pie, plum pudding,
lobster salad, Welsh rarebit, etc.; but it
does mean that roust beef, mashed pota
toes, stewed tomatoes and fruit is not
going to hurt auybody except those whose
constitutions do not "happen to agree with
any particular article. It sometimes oc
curs that one thing or another will not as
similate with a person's system, although
he may be perfectly healthy in other re
spects.
Another thine: Do not suppose that you
must confine yourself to any particular
kind of provisions, as it is most desirable
to nave a constant change of diet, not only
because we need a great many ingredients
in the system, but also because it takes
the edge off a person's appetite to live on
about the same bill of fare continually.
But care should be exercised in this mat
ter by all, particularly by those running
any distance. Moreover, diet should be
more closely observed within two days of
a race.
One of the great troubles that racers are
atlln ted with is known as "kinks." This
means that after a man has run a half
mile or so he begins to feel a pain in his
side beneath his lower ribs; some call it a
"stitch." If the race is a hard one it
"AN ATHLETE SHOULD NEVER SMOKE."
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.
would not be surprising to see the racer
quit at three-quarters of a mile. Some
times, however, a man struggles along,
either in great pain or at a slower pace.
The difficulty is very easily explained; it
merely demonstrates the presence of an un
necessary amount of liquid in the bowels.
This liquid may be tea, coffee, beer or even
water, according to the habits of the sub
ject. Any one is liable to be affected in
this way ; and as far as water is concerned
for one who does not take violent t-xercise
a considerable quantity acts as a cleanser
to the system, much as the rain water
flushes and cleans out the sewers in a city.
But for one who takes violent exercise
and preparing for a race it is a different
thing; the system does not need the saruo
cleansing because there is more persp ra
tion and far heavier breathing â both of
which have a tendency to throw off the
worn-out properties of the blood. Conse
quently liquids should be avoided as much
as possible. I have found that three cups
full of liquid each day is sufficient to sup
port life comfortably, especially in this
climate.
In regard to the question whether al
coholic liquors of any kind are necessary
or even admissible in an athlete's bill of
fare, I wish to say that it is my decided
opinion that no liquor of any kind should
be indulged in. The use of liquor in train-
Ing had ifs origin among English profes
sionals of years gone by. When not in
preparation for a contest they were
generally self-indulgent and intem
perate, the effect of which was that
when it became necessary for them :o
train down for a race they absolutely could
not get alotm without liquor of some kind,
so ale^ and wines were used, not because
of any merit of their own, but simply he-
cause they tcok the place of stronger
drinks that would prove extremely harm
ful. No, young man ! touch neither beer,
ale, wine, mixed drinks nor liquor of any
kind; they are entirely unnecessary and
positively harmful.
Smoking is another habit that au ath
lete should never indulge in. It is bad for
ihe nerves, bad for trie blood and is injuri
ous to the respiratory organs; or in the
language of the track, "the wind." Smok
ing is a habit usually contracted in youth
when the young idea imagines that it is
manly. When it once gets its hold upon
a man it is seldom abandoned, no matter
how damaging it may be to the health of
the victim.
Plenty of good sound sleep is essential
to the well-being of an athlete. While
there is no necessity of his denying him
self the pleasures of society he should not
allow social claims to keep him out late at
night or prevent his regular exercise on
the cinder path. From seven to eight
hours' sleep is the proper amount for a
healthy man in training."

IF any artist of pen or brush is eager to
find character studies of more than
ordinary interest and at the expense
of only a short stroll from the busi-
ness portion of the City, he should
direct his steps to that portion of the
beach about the foot of Sansome street,
keep his eyes wide open and watch the
procession go by.
Everybody down that way'knows old
Bob Spear. Any gamin can tell you where
he lives. "Old Bob" Las the name of
being "well off," bnt you would never
suspect it were you to see his poorly attired
form on the street, and you wouldn't be
lieve it were you to get a glimpse of the
insid9 of his dwelling-place. Nevertheless
when you get close enough to peer over
his back fence and note the fact that he has
hens in great number and a half dozen
pigs; nnd when you gaze up at the most
attractive feature in all the premisesâ his
dovecotes, with their cooing white-winged
multitude of residents â you begin to think
that Bob can't be so very bad off after all.
Bob was a boatman long ago, but the tus
sle with winds and waves was too much of
a drain on his visor of life and he settled
down as an economical landsman. No
body ever sees him spending any more
than the few pennies that keep his kitchen
supplied with the bare necessaries which
preserve the spirit safely in the clay. He
feeds his hogs and his hens on the de
cayed cabbages and other truck that are
thrown out daily by the vegetable mar
kets, and this makes the daily banquet of
his oirds and beasts. The people around
the base of Telegraph Hill are certain that
"Old Bob" is the possessor of a razor, for
the hair-crop on his face is regularly
mowed down; and they are sure that the
aged Spear would never patronize a bar
ber even at a nickel a chance. Hence they
are free to guess that the razor is an heir
loom in Bob's family.
Street arabs, Â«o they say, have seen old
Bob digging now and then in lonely spots,o ts,
and so the story has passed around tnat
Spear has treasure buried somewhere or
other, and in many a water-front breast is
inspired the hope that some day, while
pamins are digging for baitworni, they
may turn up one of old Bob's hidden pots
of gold.
The ancient fellow has an ancient male
companion, who holds the fort whenever
Bob is away. They have no visitors, and
never respond to knocks on the front door.
People in the vicinity are used to these
ways and never disturb the gray brethren.
Beach urchins have framed many mystery
tales about these old men. They are both
silent and grave. This silence and gravity
is puzzling. Now if old Bob, for instance,
would get wild once in a while and open
up with a volley of oaths, the boys would
take a supreme delight in keeping him
worried; but old Bob simply says nothing,
though his eyes have a look in them tnat

Mrs. Matilda Childs of 2625 Dearborn

partake of her osseous diet is a favor

a seminary lor young ladies, from
which she graduated with high
honors, being valedictorian of her

The mystery is like a wall of protection.
The boys perpetrate many pieces of devil
ment on the beach; they steal chickens
sometimes and torture stray animals, but
Bob's pigs are never assaulted, his hens
are never molested, and the missile of the

veneration. His silence and his piercing
eye are the most effective police force on
the water front.
"Horseshoe Kate" is famous in the dis
trict toward the foot of Sansome street.
It is a very common declaration that
woman is physically too weak to compete
with her brother, man, in tne heavier em
ployments. This claim is refuted by the
instance of "Horseshoe Kate." She may
be called an exception by some; but what
has been done can be done. Women have
ousted their male brethren from many of
the lighter walks of life. Who shall say
bat that, in a generation to come, the
e-oti^t, man, will be met by femaie comp

railroad porter, and at 5 o'clock she be
came his smiling bride; thus in three
i short hours she was met, wooed and won
! and is to-day, she says, "the same sweet'
smiling bride of eight years ago."
"My husband and I were always lovers,"
ehe declared, "and I think in" that way
we solve the problem, 'Is marriage a
failure?' "
The "bone-eater," as she is now called
by the few who are fa in i in r with her
: queer taste, has' from childhood evinced a
< decided preference for that part of the
! food generally thrown away. Her dog â
' for ahe has oue â certainly has the
etitors all along the lineâ even down to
the street-swiping contract-. Wasn't it
the Rev. Anna Shaw who a short while
ago told of her ambition to be a police
man? It is just possible that in the ap
proaching century the disorderly man wiil
be made to toe the line of the ordinance
by the star-adorned woman as solidly built
as "Horseshoe Kate."
Women may run the meat snd fish mar
kets, and drive the plow, instead of merely
monopolizing the telephone business, tho

canning. Wnat a powerful woman is
"Horseshoe Kate!" The average man is
not so stout as she. The greater part of
her time is spent out in the open air, and
she is the very picture of sturdy health.
She wears an abbreviated frock, a leathern
apron and long boots. BinomÂ»rs would
probably serve her admirably, but bloom
ers are at this per;od tabooed by water
front society, and, therefore, would be in
bad form.
"Horseshoe Kate" makes money. She
buys, cleans and smokes fish, which are
daily offered her by the fishermen who
spend most of their time in luring the

That old woman yonder, with a load of

These women, perhaps, dwell in miserable
hovels, with scarcely enough food to eat,
eking out an existence wherein there can
be little sunshine of soul. "Horseshoe
Kate," it is said, often cheerily lends a
helping hand to these victims of poverty
and misfortune â often drops them a dime
or so. Such wrinkled old faces and bony
old hands as those poor women have!
And if he could read the stories hidden in
those breasts, perhaps the realist mieht
pause to think how little he knows of the
trials of life, which he pretends to portray
as it is. Some of these old women are
truly religious, it is said. It is easy

wherein the gaunt wolf of starvation sit*
ever beside the hearthstone, there cer

of better things than beggars clothing or
crumbs from the tables of the well-fed.
The tou^'h girl will not permit herself
to be missed. There she is! Her dress
is toucrh. Her hat 13 tough. Here face is
tougher still. The dialect she speaks is a
cross between slang and profanity. She
walks with an unwomanly swagger, and
one can hardly regard her as a woman at
all. Her nose* tells a story of dissipation,
and the rest of her face furnishes corrobo
rative evidence. She is devoid of self
respect; aud there is no deep of life so low
that she will not recklessly and shame
lessly descend to it. It is too bad that the
Salvation Army cannot arrest the tough
girl and keep her in a guardhouse on
healthful rations until she undergoes a
chance of spirit.

"Whom the Stork Brings."
K_^ â^_^O ONE who hae reared a family and knows the "sweet delimits of
L < \^Wfes^' J 3^T tpntler Â» loving re" can have any adequate appreciation of what
l^JflKuHgHv is misled by those who do not enjoy the blessings of parentage.
J^^ft^lK|Uv The burden of childbearinjr, totretber with all the care* and trials
pvfij^jrJÃjljjj of bringing up a family of children, are not to be compared with
T#Â£i|y^<r^t^ H the burden of the wife who has no such cares. The mothers who
UÂ«itpMH>B*bHj| complain of the cares of motherhoodâ of a noisy house, torn clothes
and soiled carpetsâ often do not stop to balance the blessings against the cares. What
is a fxnger print on the waU if we only remember also the tiny hand that made it?
What Ma muddy little boot but a thing erf beauty to the mother wbo has so often
kisMd the little foot that wore it? Ah, yes, there are cares and trials and hard work,
and days and nights of anxiety and watchfulness, butâ "if no little boots were there,'
what then? Clean watts, bright carpets, quiet rooms, undisturbed sleep â no, no!
These are no price for baby's dimpled hands and laughing eyes and rosy lips. Let
him lord it over us; let him record his reach daily with a mark around the wall; let
him measure his stride upon the carpet and stamp his little foot with mock tyranny
and make us all tremble with a frown, for is he not the king inside these wads, and
shall not a king be clothed with majesty and power? What a world -it were if there
were no babies in it â if we were all adults ! We should die of the weariness of living.
But there are homes, thousands of them, where the sweet sunshine of childhood
never breaks in- where no little wardrobe was ever prepared for the guest "whom the
stork brings" â and there are others where all the preparations of welcome had been
made, but a raven came with tbe stork and the little stranger passed on to another
world.

STRONG, HEALTHY WOMEN.
Tbe want of the world is strong, healthy mothers. Give us these and we will
answer for the race. Nine women out of ten are lacking in health and strength, if not
positively ill. The sickly men are those who never were strongâ who were born
weak; but the sickly women get sickly because something goes wrong. It is the
ills peculiar to the sex that we are going to talk about, not in phrases which you do not
understand, but in plain, common language. It is no relief of your troubles to bear
them described in smooth Latin terms. What you want is some cure for them, and
not pleasing names for very unpleasant things.
HEALTH ESSENTIAL TO HAPPINESS.
There is no degree of beauty, intelligence or amiability which can compensate for
a diseased body in a woman. Indeed, there is no beauty, intelligence or amiability
which bad health will not undermine. Neither wealth, position nor opportunity can
compensate for the absence of health. Tbe conscientious woman has other reasons
than selfish ones for feeling bad health to be the greatest of misfortunes. She knows
she cannot be ill without casting a shadow over the home that she would, if she could,
keep always bright. If she has children she will not only find herself unable to give
them the mental and moral training they need, but she may not be able to hold even
their admiration and love, and the chances are ten to one that she has given them a
hideous heritage of disease. She may well be haunted with the fear that the day will
come when they will think of her unkindly for bringing into this world children who
cannot escape from a life of suffering because of her enfeebled constitution and their
inheritance of her weakness. She may well fear also that the time will come when
her husband will weary of coming home to the dim room where the invalid wife is
always ailing, and will go elsewhere that he may find the high spirits, the physical
vigor and the entertaining vivacity which he is never able to get in his own home. In
short, however guiltless a woman may be, she cannot but feel that she, as a chronic
invalid, is daily damaging the lives of those she loves best, and that each day which
prolongs her painful and wasted life is a misfortune rather than a blessing. Yet the
time really never comes when a woman with anything to iive for is ready to relinquish
life, do matter how acute her physical sufferings or how terrible her mental torment.
It is purery a vegetable compound â more a food than a medicine â and ia prepared

happily enjoy.

nNOVELTIES IN THE REALMS
OF
SCIENCE, LITERATURE
AND
ART.
ALFRED AND J. W. CARLSON
of Hilgard, Or., are the invent
ors of a new propeller some
what similar to the one lately
patented by a man named Gra
ham in New York. The similarity, how
ever, is only in the shape of the screw.
In the Graham boat the screw itself is
really a revolving hull, and in the Orego
nian invention the screw is made to work
â under a cigar-shaped hull that is capable
of carrying freight and passengers.
The Carlson brothers' vessel seems to be
built on scientific principles. They have
New Screw Propeller, Invented by Alfred and J. >V. Carlson, of Uilgard, Or.
[From a drawing mad? for "The Call" by Henry Hinsen.]
made use of the principle of the convey
ors that are used in flour mills all over the
world. In the case of flour mills the re
volving screw and tube being stationary,
it follows that the wheat is conveyed
through the tube. In the Carlson broth
ers' invention they have simply reversed
things. The water is statiftnaVy and it
fol ows as a matter of course, "that the
lube and ecrew must travel through it,
provided sufficient motive power is an
1 plied In the proper place.
A study of the accompanying drawing
shows that the invention consists of a
cylindrical tube on the inside of which a
screw propeller is made to revolve. The
tube is of course open at both ends.
Between the cylinder and the keel proper
is a large air space. The ballast is placed
at the bottom of the keel and the
machinery to drive the propeller is placed
in the space between the cylinder and tne
outside eides of the keel, the latter bein^
slightly tapered at both ends. The propel
ling screw is of uniform size from one end
to the other, and only make 3 one and a
half spiral coils around its axis, which will
increase the speed. Another fact not to be
overlooked is that it does away with all
suction from behind, which always reduces
the speed of any propeller. Also the
screw being inclosed in the cylinder
always works on in solid water and it will
make the vessel move quietly and steadily.
Almost any speed should be obtained
without large expense. Should the vessel
strike a sandbar it will be plainly seen that
the propeller would not come in contact
with it.
Incandescent Gasoline Lamp.
Siegfried Marcus of Vienna, Austria, is
the inventor of a lamp intended to burn
some of the hydro-carbons such as benzine
or gasoline. The method of making these
fluids illuminating is the same as is used
in the well-known Wellsbach burner, viz.:
a mantle of a thin wire of iridium so
placed that it becomes heated to incandes
cence by the flame of the burning gas.
In the lamp invented by Mr. Marcus
this result is obtained by a burner that
consists of three tubes. The outer one
Incandescent Hydrocarbon Lamp.
forms a support for the lamp-chimney and
the inner is a mixer for the gas. The
upp>er end of this is perforated. The gas
from the larao rises through two tubes on
both sides of the burner and passes into a
vaporizing chamber very much on the
principle of the ordinary trasoline stove.
Here it is heated by the heat generated by
the lamp and ascends through the perfora
tions in the tube, where it is lighted and
becomes a flame that heats the wire man
tle to a white beat that gives off a bril
liant light.
Taking the Air Without Going Oat.
Elderly people and others who may be
temporarily house-bound and prevented
from enjoying a regular daily stroll out
doors, cays the Health Magazine, can de
vise a fair substitute as follows: Bundle
up as if for the usual constitutional, select
a large sunny room, preierably at the top
of the house, open wide the windows, shut
off the heat and move around briskiy, go
ing to the window and inhalinc the'fresh
air deeply through the nostrils. We have
often called attention to the fact that
house air, with its many impurities, over
heated condition and general lifelessness,
is one of the principal predisposing causes

New Form of Bicycle.
James Flamant of this City is the in
ventor and patentee of a novel form of
bicycle. The principal point of the inven
tion is in the frame, and it is intended to
make such parts of it as bear the load the
strongest, and at the same time not use
any metal where it is not needed.
It will be seen in the accompanying cut
that the upper bar is entirely done away
with by joining the upper ends of the
front and rear wheel-posts at a common
center and connecting them with a heavy

rod. The positions of tne handle-bars and
seat are certainly novel, and sure to save
considerable weight. By reason of the
rider's weight coming on one center it is
claimed that vibration is almost entirely
done away with.
X-Kay Pictures Without a Photographic
Plate.
Right describes in L'Electricien, says
the Electrical Review, London, an appa
ratus by which he obtains the Roentgen
I pictures without the use of the photo
graphic plate, by a method similar to that
employed by Lich ten berg and Kundt.
Under the Crookes tube is fixed a sheet of
black cardboard, backed by a sheet of alu
minnm, which is connected to earth.
Below this is fixed a sheet of ebonito,
backed with tinfoil, which latter is connect
ed through an air-condenser to the cathode
of the tube. The anode of the tube is also
put to earth. If a hand is now laid on the
cardboard, and subjected for a sufficient
time to the action of the tube, it will be
found that an electrical picture of the
hand a la Roenteen has been imprinted on
the sheet of ebonite. This can be made
visible by the well-known mixture of sul
phur and red lead, or bj' another mixture
of talc and dioxid and magnesium, which
gives the effect more closely resembling a
photograph. The bones, etc., are shown
in these electroirraphs just the same as in
tho Roentgen photographs.
Model of an Atlantic Liner.
Dr. Frank Brandow of Pittsfield, Mass.,
was in New York the other day with a
beautiful shining toy which he proudly
exhibited to friends, says the Herald. The
doctor is well known in the Berkshire
Hill region as the possessor of a complete
laboratory and a most ingenious skill in
mechanics, which he follows as a pastime
during his leisure hours.
"One year ago," said he, "when I made
a visit to England, I met J. C. Bwazey,
superintendent of the British Model
"Works at London, where he showed me
The Paris in Metal.
their large collection of wooden models
for all sorts of. marine craft. When we
reached the Atlantic liners I remarked
how much handsomer the models would
be in metal.
" 'Yes.' said Mr. Swazey. 'but it can't bo
done. You couldn't get the proper curves
on the keel. If you tried to make it in
pieces and then weia them in piaceyou
would have nothing but a botchwork re
sult. It can't be done."'
Then followed a controversy on what
could and could not be done with metals
between the American amateur and the
British expert. It ended in a wager of
$1000 between them, Dr. Brandow under
taking to construct an al;-metai perfect
model of the Pans, with parts brazed to
gether, nothing being cast, and to accom
plish this feat by simply following a photo- 1

rfiraph of the vessel, with which he was
familiar, no measurements being taken.
"Now, heie is the Paris/ said the doc
tor, "and I'm going over soon to collect
the debt. I knew it could be done, and it
will give me pleasure to twist Cousin Bull's
tail. I've been a whole year on the job."
The model is an excellent burnished
piece of workmanship. Except the figure
head on tlie prow and the emerald and
ruby jewels used for the steamer's lights,
every detail from hull to rigging is made
by hand. There are 3000 pieces in all, so
riveted with bolts that the entire mechan
ism can be taken apart. The hull is of
burnished copper, in many pieces, but
brazed into perfect curves. The cordage
of copper wire falls to the ship's sides from
silver masts. The captain stands on a
bridge of brass, of which the deck and
nearly all its furnishings are composed.
AH the minutiae of a complicated ocean
liner, machinery, of course, excepted, are
carried out with elaborate detail. The
pilot ladder is gold and the passenger lad
der astern is aluminum. Her silken flags
are set for entering an English port, a
dainty Union Jack at the peak.
Genesis of the Steam-Carriage.
"The genesis of the steam-carriage is fa
miliar," says B. F. Spalding in Cassier'a
Magazine. 'It may be said that we owe
its first materialization toCuguot, who was
born in France in 1729, and died in 1804.
When he was 40 years old he constructed
a steam-carriaee, .using steam at high
pressure, which carried persons at the rate
of two or three miles an hour, in an exhi
bition which he made of it before Marshal
Haxe; but the boiler was so limited in ca
pacity that after every twelve or fifteen
minutes he was obliged to stop to recruit
its exhausted energies. Improving upon
this he built another, but unfortunately
while whirling through the streets at the
reckless speed of three miles an hour it
upset, and being looked upon with disfa
vor by the populace it was condemned,
not from any inherent defect, but through
prejudice. Fortunately it was preserved,
as it deserved to be, and may now be seen
at the Conservatoire dcs Arts ci Metiers at
liNoWi
Paris â an evidence of many things which
cannot be gainsaid."
Basket-Carrier for Bicycles.
An attachment for any ordinary bicycle
so that it can very easily carry a heavy

bicycle wheel that is secured to a U-shaped
frame. To the upper corners of this amis
are secured that can be made fast to the
bicycle frame by turning a few screws. In
the square space between the four bars it
is intended to hang the basket or package.
An Ice Bicycle.
Augustus J. Brace and Edwin Brown of
New York have come to the relief of
bicyclists of that section of the world by
inventing a machine that can be used in
the winter. The invention is really an
attachment for an ordinary bicycle so that
it will run over the surface of a frozen
lake.
To the front fork of the machine there is
fastened a steel shoe that takes the place
of the wheel that nas to be removed.
This is bent in the form of a graceful
curve and is very springy. The pneu
matic tire of the rear wheel is removed
and in its stead a steel band with calks is
put on. On either siae of the rear wheel
there is a runner, the front end of which
is secured to the frame ami the rear por
tion to the rear axle. The rider keeps his
balance by the movement of the handle
bars the same as if riding over an oidinary
road in the summer.
The New English Dictionary.
The completion of the new English dic
tionary on the elaborate scale hitherto
followed is by no means a certainty, says
the London Chronicle. For several years
the work has been carried on at hifh pres
sure, especially in the department under
Dr. Murray's personal control ; yet, despite
this fact, the end of D has not been
reached, and though E has been completed
by Henry Bradley, F is not yet finished.
That is to say, since 1884 only four letters
of the alphabet and portions of two others
have been settled with. At this rate of
progress it is hard to see how we can ex
pect the last number of the dictionary
under a quarter of a century hence.
Meanwhile, the great expense to the
Oxford University Press continues, and it
is quite within the bounds of possibility
that a stoppage may take place. Much as
this would be regretted, it is doubtful
whether guch a course would not be prefer
able to the continuance of the work on
hast}' and incomplete lines. That some
scheme of curtailment has been mooted is
evident from the recent action of the
Clarendon Press delegates who have
offered a few suggestions to the
workers. Their recommendations point
to tlie need of more concise treat
ment in all the deparimenis; as, for in
stance, the elimination of much of the
etymological matter usually inserted, in
some cases as much as one-half thÂ« quan
tity being regarded as unnecessary. The
definitions, too, they would have in much
less profusion; ana when we notice the
immense amount of subdivision in the
treatment of the commoner words of the
language (the word pnd alone has thirteen
main and seven subordinate senses) there
does appear a possibility of pulling in.
The greatest part of the space in the dic
tionary is taken up by the quotations;
these the delegates would lessen consider
ably, suggesting that the word modern
should be used in place of many citations
of later date; recent illegitimate exten
sions of meaning they would omit alto
gether.
A few other suggestions for special kinds
of words have also been made, and it re
mains to be seen whether the editors will
be ahle to fall in therewith. That this will
be found extremely difficult will be felt by
any one who has had experience of dic
tionary-making or any other form of com
pilation in which close attention to detail
is necessary. In the case of the new Eng
lish dictionary the difficulty is height
ened almost to impossibility, by very rea
son of the fifteen years' worK already per
formed in one method.
An Adjustable Keel,
Leonard O. Smith of Philadelphia, Pa.,
is the inventor of a keel for sailing vessels
that can be adjusted to the tack on which
the craft is sailing. This is accomplished
by the use of a pla:e hinged to the hull at
a point below the center of gravity. To
use this plate the navigator has only to
move a lever that passes through the hull
Yacht With Movable Keel.
of the vessel and into the cockpit. This |
lever is arranged to act on the keel and j
move the lower edge of it to the right or
left, so that it can be made to work on the
water at such an angle as will offer the
greatest resistance. If the wind is blow
ing hard on the starboard quarter the bot
tom edge of the keel can be moved to port
as far as is necessary to prevent the vessel
from "heeling over " and making leeway.
How Fly-WheelÂ« Break.
The causes of fly-wheel accidents were
explained by Professor C. ri. Benjamin of
the Case School of Applied Science, Cleve
land, in a recent lecture in that city. We
quote a few paragraphs from an abstract in
the Scientific Machinist (March 15). Says
the Professor:
Fly-wteel accidents may be attributed to
several causes, viz. : (1) poor castings or
internal strains, (2) faulty construction
and design, (3) sudden shocks or stops, (4) |
miscellaneous external causes such as the j
breaking of belts or shaft, (5) excessive j
speed. The strain of throwing v heavy j
load on and off suddenly will eventually
break any ordinary fly-wheal. It
used to be a rule that the
speed of a rim of a fly-wheel
should not exceed 3000 feet per minute,
but this had gradually increased until
double that speed was common. There
are thousands of belts running that fast
and many faster. Excessive speed, how
ever, is the cause of the majority of acci
dents.
The tendency of fly-wheel arms to break
at the hub has been known only about
three years. The centrifugal tension on
the rim of a fly-wheel is equal on every
square inch. There is some expansion in
the metal of the rims and arms, but it fol
lows that the parts most firmly bound to
the hub wilt spring or bend outward under
this strain the least. Midway between the
arms the rim will bend outward the great
est, and if one will make a wheel with a
rubber rim this will be very plainly no
ticed under high speed. For this reason
joints should be placed at the spokes. It
is a mistake to place them between the
spokes.
dstiron is a treacherous material to use
in flywheels. The use of wood in flywheel
construction is a recent tendency in the
East. While wood is, iv certain ways,
stronger than castiron (i. c., in proportion
to its weight) a \tooden wheel is probably
no better than an iron wheel, for the rea
son that the glued joints are liable to give
way. Their strength can only be a mat
ter of conjecture. If one is to be killed oy
a wrecked flywheel it makes little differ
ence whether wood or iron is the instru
ment.
Thn Emperor as an Inventor.
The latest capacity in which the Ger
man F.mperor has chosen to reveal him
self is that of an inventor of a new system
of fastenings for water-tight doors in men
of-war, says the New York Times. He
turned up in the harbor of Syracuse the
other day, in the Hol.enzollern, and the
oflkers of the. British cruiser Astrsea,
which happened to be lying there, were
not a little astonished soon afterward to
see him approaching their vessel in a
steam launch, attired in the panoply of a
British aamiral. He inspected the Astraa
minutely and then carried off the captain
to the HoUenzollern. After entertaining
him royally, he took him down into the
engine-room and there pointed out a
water-tight door in one of the bulkheads,
which, he said, he had invented himself
and expected to see imitated generally.
The door was of the kind known techni
cally as a '"clipped door" â that is, it is se
cured when shut by means of short lever
catches which are called "clips." In the
English service as many as a dozen of
these clips are often used to secure one
door.
The improvement claimed by the Em
peror is that instead of having to work the
clips singly, thus involving several opera
tions, he can, by an arrangement of levers,
work them all simultaneously in one
operation only. Provided the mechanism
is not too compiicated and likely to pet
out of order the invention seems to be one
of considerable practical value, the mani
fest objection being that if the lever hap
pened to be out of order at a critical mo
ment all the clips and the door would be
useless.
An Klectrlcal Aerial Torpedo.
An instrument of warfare, termed an
"aerial torpedo," has Deen designed to be
used in the siege of cities or to scatter
large bodies of troops while at rest. The
torpedo c insists of a small-sized gas-filled
balloon cauable of sustaining for any
length of time from thirty to forty pounds
at an elevation of from 500 to 1000 feet
above the earth. Inside of the lower or
small end of the balloon is placed a metal
cylinder which ontaius an electrical de
vice, the purpose of which is to ignite the
gas in the balloon at any stated period
Under the balloon is suspended a car or
basket containing high explosives similar
to dynamite, which will explode with ter
rific force when striking a hard substance
Jike the earth or walled embankments
To use the aerial torpedo effectively, which
requires only a corporal's guari, all that
is iiecessary is to approach as near as pos
sible the Locality where ihe torpedo is de
sired to take effect and to ascertain the di
rection of the loser air current ana the ve
locity of the same per hour. The length
of time it would take for the sir current to
carry the torpedo over the objective point
can thus be ascertained and the electric
time-exploding apparatus set to the proper
hour or minute. As soon as the time has
expired an electric spark ignites the gas in
the balloon, causing it to explode and the
torpedo will drop to the earth. Tde ex
plosive striking tne earth will cause seri
ous damage in that locality. The torpedo
can be used by day or night by a few men
of ordinary intelligence and no defense can
be made against it.â Electrical World.
Electric Light a Sanitary Factor.
The subject of electric lighting of hos
pitals is receiving considerable attention
abroad. The superior healthiness, cleanli
ness ana convenience of the electric light,
as compared to other form* of lighting,
together with the fact that it does not cost
more than an equal illumination by gas,
render it an ideal illuminant for hos
pitals. A hospital requires a light that
can be localized by means of more or less
portable lamps, and with this in the elec
tric light we have combined safety and
freedom from vitiation of the atmosphere.
One disadvantage was, until recently, that
it was impossible to vary the intensity of
the light of an incandescent lamp, but this
has been overcome by several devices now
on the market, so that one is enabled to
obtain any desired degree of illumination
from a mere glow to the full light of the
lamp by simply turning a Key. In this
connection some interesting statistics are
reported by a large firm at Norwich, Eng
land, which taree years ago adopted elec
tric lighting in its factories. In connec
tion with the firm there is a benefit fund,
anil during the last few years preceding
the adoption of electricity benefits were
received tÂ»y employes on account of sickness
amounting to 11 per cent of the people
employed, but since the introduction of
the electric light the number receiving
benefits were only 4 per cent of this num
ber.
Diphtheria Anti-Toxlnei.
Dr. Cartwright Wood gave recently, be
fore the Royal Society, some interesting
particulars on his method for rapidly pro
ducing diphtheria anti-toxines, by which
he claims that an animal can be rendered
immune toward large quantities of diph
theria poison, and also that such animals
can be made to produce powerful diph
theria anti-toxines. The distinctive fea
ture of the method consists in the use of
the products produced by the growth of
the diphtheria bacillus in albuminous
fluids made by the addition ol serum to
ordinary peptone broth. The fluid is al
lowed to grow for three or four weeks at a
temperature of 37 degrees C. and after
filtration heated for an hour at 65 degrees
C. The experiments have been carried
out on horses and the immunity produced
is most striking. It is claimed for this
method that powerful diphtheria anti
toxines can be easily produced in a shorter
space of time than has hitherto been pos
sible, and that as a consequence thn
amount of serum necessary to be injected
is greatly reduced. Its greater strength
will permit of the patient receiving at the
beginning: of treatment a sufficient quan
tity of the serum at one injection, by
which experience has shown that curative
action is exerted in the most marked
manner.â London Chronicle.

A striking illustration of the influence
of fatigue upon the nervous system is

A new manufactured product entitled
j "pantasote" has been awarded a medal and
award of merit by the Franklin Institute,
Philadelphia, in view of the report of the
committee on science and arts, which
describes "pantasote 1 " as a "highly merito
rious substitute for leather for a number of
uses for which leather is a. apted." "'This
report." says Industries and Iron, "is the
result of two years' investigations into t c

of manuacturing the new product is stated
to be the coating of tough paper and

According to recent experiments de
scribed in ihe Medical Re ord each pint of
air breathed in by an adult contains about
I 15,000 microbes. In some plac' s the num

city number is about as stated. This
microbe-laden air is tanen into the air
passages, and when it is thrown out it is
quite sterile. The air has further been
iound to be sterile in the naso-pharyngeal
cavity. The inference is that the nose is
a most powerful microbe-destroyer, and
this fact shows abo how important it is to
draw the air through the nasal passages.

and *be knows it. She did not come by
this knowledge of her own accord, but by
being admired by thousands of people.
As Nellie's home is not far from the Ho
tel VeQdouae. in San Jose, she is around
that caravansary a large part of her time
ana attracts a great deal of attention from
the guests. KodaKs are plentiful about
the hotel and nearly everybody who owns
one wants a picture of NeTlie. A3 a result
the little doe has become so used to having
her picture taken that she wants it done
all the time.
The little boy who owns Nellie is proud
of her achievements and says that she
learned to sit up by herself. When her
picture was taken for the frrst time she did
not seem to liKe it and would not stay still
for a moment. But in a short time she
grew so that she rather enjoyed it, and as
the peoDle for whom she posed were sure*
to give her something nice to eat there was
a double inducement.
At present Nellie don't want anything
better than to have her picture taken. If
she sees anybody walking alone the streets
with a camera she will run in front of
them and stand on her hind feet, making
every effort to look her prettiest. If her
request is complied with she has several
"poses" that she will gladly take in suc
cession for the purpose of fiaving them
"snapped. 1 She knows when the exposure
has been made, and always jumps around
as soon as she hears the shutter click. If
the person happens to be a siranner and
she fails to make herself understood she
shows evident signs of disappointment.
Nellie is only a little over 3 years old,
but her beautiful silky coat has been
photographed nundredsof times. Most of
the people who have "taken" her have
been tourists, and the chances are that her
picture can be found in nearly every large
city in the Union.
A UNICORN RABBIT,
Strange One-Eared Quadruped
Caught Near Tocaloma.
Miss Bertrand, daughter of the hotel
keeper at Tocaloma, captured a most un
usual quadruped a few days ago. It is a
specimen of the ordinary cotton-tailed
rabbit, but differs Irom the rest of his
tribe by not having his just share of ears.
In fact he has only one, and that is "right
in the middle of his forehead."
Possibly this rabbit realized that he was
different from his fellows, for he was first
seen only a few hundred yards from the
hotel. When he was chased, instead of
getting away as fast as possible, ho ran
into a clump of shrubbery and staid there
nntil he was picked up. And the strangest
thing is that he never seemed frightened
at any time, but allowed himself to be
handled just as if he was used to it all his
life.
The body of Miss Bertrand's rabbit is
exactly like allother rabbits, and so is the
shape of his head. His fur is the same
color and there appears t;> be no difference
in size from others of his species. But to
look at him is startling. Ar.d all on ac
count of that strange, uncanny ear. It
sticks up in the wildest manner and wakes
the little animal look about twice his real
size. It also gives him the ferocious ap
pearance that Indians have when they put

While the rabbit captured at Tocaloma
has only one ear it really seems to have
two orifices. The openings are on the
sides of the ear and not far from the usual
places. From the upper portions of them
the skin of the ear grows toward the cen
ter of the head where it joins the one from

the other side, and the two become one
piece of flesh. The upper portion of the
ear is not unusual, except for the fact that
the inside is turned toward the back
instead of toward the sides. The single
ear is nearly twice the size of one in nor
mal condition.
Notwithstanding his peculiarity, the
one-eared rabbit is as happy as can be.
He hoDS around his pen in the liveliest
manner, and when he is picked up shows
signs of beine pleased at the attention.
An Old Scalping Knife.
An Indian scalping knife was found in a
tree in Clearfield County, Pa., a few days
ago. The blade was embedded twenty
feet from the ground, and as
the tree counted 175 rings from the point
of the knife to its hilt, it would indi
cate that the blade had been in the same
position for almost two centuries. The
stamp on the side of the knife consists of
the representation of a crown and a bottle,
and it was no doubt imported from Eng
land in the early daysof the colonists and
was probably traded to the Indians.â

THE LAEST FASHION GOSSIP
\m â^ VKKY one is now on the wing,
Â an unusual number having al
==^ ready flown toward Europe. All
the fashionable resorts will be
well patronized and from indica
tions I should say that we may anticipate
a gay summer, and certainly I hope for
one on account of the number of pretty
girls, who so enjoy having a good time.
And what trunks full of lovely gowns will
accompany many of them, but few are
provided with less than a dozen fetching
toilettes for the summer's campaign.
Many of these are simple and inexpensive
enough, but very charming, bearing wit
ness to the fact that our women have more
than their snare of taste and a very cor-
rect eye for the beautiful.
Polo at Burlingame? Well, I do not
know whether I will see that game on Sat
urday or not, but it will be a good gamo
and well played, I am quite certain, and
ths gowns of many Df the women will be
smart enough to warrant more than a
passing glance, provided frequent showers
are not predicted.
On Tuesday next one of the fairest and
sweetest maidens in California will be
come a bride. Much will probably be
written about the quiet home weading,
which will be witnessed by but twenty-five
in all, and the beauty and number of the
wedding gifts will form the principal topic
for many a chat, but for my part I have
nntliin-; to say excepting that all who
know both bride and groom consider that
they should be equally congratulated.
There is to be a pretty wedding here in
June, and still luncheons continue to be
be given of an elaborate nature, but by
t tie end of this month most of us will be
off in search of sunshine and freckles, i
Some will don bloomers and go on bicy
cling tours, and others will examine their
guns and fishing tackle, as not a few of
our women are excellent shots and expert
anglers. In fact, I must myself confess
that a fishing-rod has a great fascination
for me, so you may in the near future hear
from me something about sporting cos
tumes.
A fetching bicycle suit has just been de
signed by Falk. it is a very coarse weave
of brown, linen duck. The short skirt is j
very plain only having six lines of stitch- !
ing round the* bottom. The pretty little I
coat is fancifully cut and has a broad col
lar, revers, and cuff points of ecru linen j
duck. The coat is adorned with brown I
braiding and dark brownish pearl buttons, j
A shirt waist is, of course, worn, a smart
belt and tie, but in conclusion I must not
forget to tell you that "the special feature ;
of the skirt is the shaping of the under- j
neath back breadths to fit the saddle and I
wheel frame in such a manner as to allow |
the overlaying plaits to hang straight from
the skirt belt without a break at the sad
dle."
The fad of having the bicycle and cos
tume all match is increasing in favor, and
cine especially stylish one is in hunters'
green picked out with ecru; the fair rider
wore a tailor-made costameof dark green
cloth and an ecru linen shirt.
A correspondent writes to Vogue asking
for information concerning the number I
and material of gowns necessary- for a I
summer at a seaside hotel, and in reply is
told to have a tailor-made gown of "serge,
homespun or tweed, with a plain skirt and
a jacket bodice, which can be worr over
shirt waists. A mohair dress, in a becom
ing dark shade, also tailor ma.de, is almost
a necessity, as it is cool and sheds the
dust." For afternoon wear a giace taffeta
is suggested, the bodice to be elaborately
trimmed, and for the same purpose is ab
solutely required a grenadine creation,
which can be worn as a general visiting
gown, in afternoon teas and for church.
Several fancy silk bodices, some cut
hiefa and others low, will do to wear, some
of them with the grenadine skirt, others !
with the well-made black or light silk
skirts, which every woman who goes out
at all is supposed to own. A dozen per
fectly fitted shirt waists are necessities,
and they can be worn with a white mohair
or pique skirts on bright days, and on dull
ones a dark skirt is preferable.
A useful dress is of "white or colored
duck cress, barred and tailor-made, with a
skirt and blazer."
"A flowered batiste with a lace stripe
made over Bilk. with lace and ribbons," I
cannot well be dispensed with, and if a
satin gingham and a dainty dimity is
added one can manage, provided one does â¢
not indulge in yachting, coifing, tennis, j
etc., as in such cases suitable costumes
must be worn.
As far as wraps are concerned Vogue '
says that only a "mackintosh, a covert j
jacket, a golf cape and a fancy cape will be !
needed." Then my lady must have for 1
A LOVELY TEA GOWN.
traveling a toque, a black picture hat and
a very dressy one especially designed to be
worn with the grenadine, '"one or two
bonnets and a earden hat (a Leghorn.)"
In conclusion she is ' advised to have a
black silk petticoat much frilled and wired,
as well as one of white silk. Of course
morreen can be substituted. Such petti
coats are absolute necessities as our skirts
should btÂ»ve a certain flare. An abundant
supply of slippers, boots, .shoes, gloves and
lingerie will take one comfortably through
a season. , . ,
The echoes of the wedding balls an
nouncing the marriage of the i'rincess
Alexandra have scarcely died away, and
already we have full descriptions of her
charming gowns. The evening toilets are
the most interesting; an exquisite one of
light blue has a skirt of moired aurore,
and, as tbe name implies, it is of a pale
blue, which is shot with a tender rosy
pink, in some lights, and in others with a
golden hue. The body of the same silk is
veiled with lipht blue chiffon, which is
carried up to a yoke made of blue chiffon
puffs divided by little oars of ecru inser
tion. The sleeves are each formed of four
blue chiffon puffs. Another costume of
pale blue satin is a la Louis Seize, with
small bunches of roses over it, as it were,
interrupting gleaming lines of silver pail
lettes that diversify the skirt. More of
these delicate silver lines are seen on tbe
bodice, and each of them terminates at the
berthe, with a small embroidered rose
that is almost imbedded in the puffs of
blue chiffon, of which the sleeves are also
made, with little satin turrets worked
with silver and roses over the tops of them.
A rose-tinted satin has silvery stripes of
moire woven into it, which is a chic nov
elty, and a pink corded silk, shot with
white and pale green has a graceful floral
design all over it. Yet another pink con
fection is of a shot chine silk, and has a
sort of F.ton coat bodice, with a white
chiffon furet, over which is some filmy
beurre lace. A wnite velours soie (a beau
tiful fabric) has interwoven pale gray
green velvet stripes.
At the Coburg fetes the bride wore
a dress described as truly picturesque.
The skirl is of a rich rose glace sick, all
over flowers of a chine description, with a
full but narrow ruche of tb#sameall round
the bottom.
So greatly does the Princess prefer abso
lutely plain skirts that this is the onlvone
of her sKirts so adorned. The bodice is of
the Louis Quinze style, and it is of rich
silk of the old Fragonard iose tint, with
the loveliest white lace appliqued upon it,
not in the usual way. hut the lace flowers
and foliage are unconnected by any mesh
and made for the exact places they occupy
on both sides of the revers, the deep cuffs,
pockets and the basque, which like the
entire coat is lined with pale canary satin.
The front is of the same satin, and there
is a little lace cravat. What a lucky
Princess, to have so many beautiful
frocks. She has dozens of them, but not
one black dress: a very pale green is her
favorite color, which is seen in several of
her tea gowns, one of maize and white is
said to be "indescribably dainty."
Alexandra has an abundance of every
day frocks for all seasons and ail occa
sions. Numerous are the mohair and
clotn dresses, all of which are lined with
shot silks in contrasting colors. Her gowns
of" grass linen are all silk-lined, the linini:
matching either the figures or stripes em
broidered on the linen or are of tbe same
tone as the linen. The Princess' mother
has wisely seen that her daughter
is also provided with every comfort loving
foresight can provide, as numerous are
also her robes de chambre and petticoats
of the delightful Zenana fabric, which is
crinkled silk above and the softest of wool
beneath. There are also silk, woolen and
cambric neglicees galore.
Her mantles and cloaks are not numer
ous, but show much sense in the selection.
A military-looking coat is of fawn cloth,
trimmed with silk soutache of the same
shade, and an ecra lace shoulder-cape is
over pink accordion-pleated chiffon and
has a pink chiffon ruche round the neck.
The lingerie is exquisitely fine, real torchon
and Valenciennes lace trimming predomi
nating.
Boots, shoes and slippers of every de
scription (quite numerous enough to stock
a small store) will accompany the Princess
to her new home. There are riding boots
of the newest cut and strong leathern
waiting boots. Besides there are red kid
shoes with gold studs and bronze shoes
with studs to match. Cromwell shoes in
tan with large bronze buckles and stylish
kid shoes for practical wear. All these
boots, etc., have round toes and moderate
heels.
A chic froc for Monterey is of a willow
green taffeta embroidered with flowers of
a lighter shade. The bodice is covered
with the sheerest crass linen embroidered
in tiny pinfc rose buds; bands of insertion
allow "pale green silk to show.
Another lovely confection is also of grass
linen of the finest quality. It is entirely
lined, with a silk which changes from mauve
,to crimson. The bodice is a work of art,
being covered with embroidery of a cash
aierian desien, in which several colors
. blend beautifully. A hat of green straw,
i trimmed with California violets and green
I tulle is most becoming.
| Then if you want one of the dearest
| little frocks of this same popular fabric
purchase thirteen yards from one of our
leading stores of the semi-transparont
grass linen embroidered all over with
siljeen violets and long green stems. You
can bave either very pale violets or those
â¢ of a dark hue, according as you desire to
i have the lining of mauve or violet Bilk.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 10, 1896.
! Such a dress will be very expensive, but
j equally lovely.
In Paris large quantities of a snow-white
â  grass linen is being used with much suc
j cess. For instance, from a celebrated
I house comes a gown of white glace,
! sprigged with black. The skirt is entirely
j composed of this silk and the bodice of
i white glace, over which is the white linen
I with bands of tambour embroidery run
with tiny black velvet baby ribbon. The
sleeves are of the same and the bodice and
sleeves are finished with a roll of black
velvet.
A fascinating costume, suitable for many
functions, is of a pinkish chine silk, cov
j ered with a small blurred figure. The very
I ample sKirt is composed entirely of the
j silk, and the bodice of creamy wnite lawn
over a pale-pink glace. There is a lovely
I yoke, composed of tucks and fine inser
tion. Then there is a novel arrangement
of two pairs of pink silken scarfs. These
start from the waist in front and behind,
and are drawn up to the arm hole, leaving
a free end to fall graceful!}- over the pretty
sleeves. These scarfs are edged on both
sides with three thread-like lines of black
velvet ribbon. An extravagant concep
tion, which should not be given much
thought except by those who can have
A> AFTERNOON TOILET OF BLUE CANVAS
numerous toilette?. With it goes a true
j picture hat of pink shirred tulle, veiled
! with white. Pink roses form a cache
peigne, and there are three choux of black
and pink tulle.
Can you imagine, for a fair-haired
beauty, a creation of pale-green moire shot
with a golden shade and adorned with
creamy lace which covers the bodice? A
dress of blue moire has the water mark
followed out with small black spangles.
This idea of tracing the water mark on
moires with sequins or spangles is a de
cided novelty, and a very effective one.
The bodice matches, and* is draped with
blue tulle, scattered with diamonds.
Sleeves have vanished from all French
evening gowns which emanate from the
best houses. Little puffs of tulle or lace
have taken their place, and a bow of rib
bon or a small bunch of flowers is usually
added. Light gloves almost reaching the
shoulder are worn.
Numerous are the demands for Louis
Seize gowns, so you can appreciate one of
chine silk, which has a white ground cov
ered with red flowers. The bodice is of
black satin, the basque is full, and with it
is worn an ample fichu of white chiffon,
which ia bordered with three full frills, and
they drape the arm from the elbow of the
close-fitting sleeve. A bunch of crimson
flowers appears at one side of the bodice,
and the lining of this effective gown is of
black glace taffeta.
A very beautiful Parisian gown is of
white moire embroidered with seed pearls
on the pattern of the water mark. The
low bodice is of white gauze covered with
spangles and diamonds. One from the
same source for a matron is of black and
pink Pekin satin. The bodice is of pink
satin veiled with black gauze and finished
with black velvet bows.
Some of the gowns now being worn in
Paris on the boards of the Francais must
be truly charming. Mme. Brandes appears
in one scene in a gown of yellow cloth
over which is a scroll-like design in yellow ;
silk. A ruche and frill of chiffon com
plete the skirt. The ample sleeves of
chiffon are built up on. a foundation of
yellow silk. On the bodice there is a deep
frill of the chiffon. It is further beautified '
with a triangular-shaped trimming of in- I
sertion, through which run tiny ribbons of
black velvet. These are tied in choux on
both sides.
A little bonnet of green straw is worn
with this, and it is trimmed with two
bunches of yellow roses. Diadem-like in
front lay a broad cold band caught down
by cabocbons in jet. At tne sanoe time
Mme. Barlet appeared in a silk-lined
crepe costume. In front the skirt was
arranged in panels, between which ap
peared pleated gauze. The short, full
sleeves were of orange velvet covered
with an artistic pattern. Down the front
of the bodice was a plat of fine lace, and at
the neck and sleeves appeared black
rushes of chiffon. In most Parisian
dresses this touch of black is noticeable.
In the third act Mme. Barlet was ex
quisitely robed in a tea eown which I bave
Dad sketched for your benefit, as it is such I
a youthful and beautiful gown, and re- j
member how it is arranged. Over an un
dress of blue chiffon, flashing with many
silver spangles, fell a robe of yellow satin.
Garlands of roses, painted with true ar
tistic sense, adorned tbe rich material;
long branches were trailing all round the
edge of the skirt, while single flowers
or small bunches peeped forth among the
folds. The satin was in front cut short,
and gave the appearance of a high be.lt,
encircling filmy folds of chiffon. It was
edged with ruchings of black tulle, a black
velvet ribbon round the throat striking
the corresponding note. A pointed waist
coat of guipure, epaulettes of spangles,
cloud-like chiffon sleeves, and some roses
tucked in the corsage gave the finishing
touches to this beautiful gown.
But the most fascinating costume worn
was donned by Mme. Brandes in the first
act. It was composed of unbleached lawn
over silk of the same tint, The gown was
cut to perfection, and the skirt was
absolutely plain. The bodice had a
boxpleat down the front and her
waist was encircled with a belt
of leather, which exactly matched
the lawn, as did also her shoes â sun
shade, and at her throat was a most
becoming touch of color, the ruche being
of rose pink, which appeared at the throat
and cuff*. Her large straw hat was cov
ered with roses, and the satin ribbon in it
matched the ruche exactly. Almost as
charming was her evening toilette of
mignonette green shaded satin, ronnd the
low neck of which was arranged a fichu of
mousseline de soie, lace edged. On the
shoulders it was fastened with tufts of
rose-pink velvet and bunches of violets.
Here and there on the bodice flashed
beautiful rhinestone buttons mounted in
copper.
In "Les Danichefs," another French play
now running in Paris, some notable toil
ettes are seen. Madame Tessandier wore,
in the Parisian scene, a superb lavender
colored of velvet cut a ia princess. The
large collar with stole-like ends was of
velvet and exquisitely embroidered in em
eralds, gold and silver, edged by a tiny frill
of lavender chiffon, but at the throat and
sleeves was some rare old lace. The lin
ing was of emerald green satin. Another
gorgeous robe was of lemon colored velvet.
The back of the body was absolutely plain.
The front was composed of a loose coat
made entirely of chinchilla. It opened on
a waistcoat of the velvet richly covered
with go!d and jewels. The narrow jeweled
belt, which kept it in place, appeared also
at the back. On the left side of the skirt
was fastened a huge bouquet of Parma
violets. Though the dress was decollete
the sleeves were long and tightly stretched
over the arm.
Among some truly lovely trousseau
gowns, just completed, 1 have selected a
few to describe. A gown of black and
white striped silk is finished round the
bottom by a narrow band of black satin,
caught at intervals with turquoises and
gold buttons. The bodice io made of the
silk, with box pleats; these are veiled in
creamy lace, which is arranged a la jabot
over them. Tbe vest is of accordion
kilted chiffon. The lace collar is orna
mented with trimmings of gold and tur
quoises.
A lovely gown of crepe de chine has its
skirt edged with ttiree tiny rows of
Valenciennes, the sleeves and bodice oe
inc of the same crepe and ornamented
with deep corselet and revers of pale blue
silk covered with guipure and a full vest
of creme crepe. A bow of blue ribbon and
a dainty bunch of violets complete a gown
well worthy of our consideration.
A plain skirt of blue satin draped with
net embroidered in silver and pearls goes
with a bodice covered with the same net,
which ia completed by a waistband and
shoulder straps of pale blue velvet. A
small flounce of the lace forms the sleeves.
Another simple but smart gown is
of a plain blue canvas, the skirt of
which is a broad band of folded silk.
Vest and collar are of a blue-and-white
striped velvet. With this gown is worn
a blue satin chip hat, lined with white;
whit- tulle surrounds tne crown in a full
ruche. Three blue quills stand erect at
the left side.
The first hats in which tulle figured
were charming, but now it bids fair to be
come common, so generally is it used. In
shades, one veiling the other should never
be indulged in on amateurish hats, as only
the French imported hats have the proper
air and style to make such a chapeau a
success. So foolishly have most hats been
overloaded with trimmings of all descrip
tions that it is with relief one reads of the
Princess Alexandra's simple hats. One is
composed of shaded pink roses, veiled
with tulle, at the right side of which are
three blacK ostrich plumes and a black
aigrette. A hat of black satin straw is
turned up at the back and is adorned with
black chiffon and deep rink azaleas. A
chip hat of a delicate pink shade
has a dented crown, straw bows
are in front, and clusters of wild roses on
either side, and an aigrette is formed of a
single white rosebud. It would certainly
be well if some women would learn a les
son from thedescription o! these chapeaux,
all of which are free of all oddities and ex
aggerations.
Grass lawn, although a simple, inexpen
sive looking fabric, has proved itself
capable oi any amount of elaboration, and
is to be seen plain, striped with lace and
sequin incrusted. embroidered and covered
with lace appliqne, and is used on woolen,
silk and alpaca dresses with excellent
results.
For the fourth season is blue and green
again fashionable.
At the last "drawing-room" many
nioire trains were interwoven with metal,
and numerous are the gowns of chiffon
and lace which are traced with silver
thread, gold tinsel or silver and studded
with pearls. The tulle gown, although
charming, is doomed, being a very expen
sive frocn and sadly perishable. A nov
elty is ihe application of heavy Bilk em
broidery, jet and paillettes upon such
ethereal fabrics as mou3seline de soie.
When jet as an embroidery is used mousse
line almost always forms the groundwork,
and beautiful is the result when gold or sil
ver are skillfully employed. Thedesiensof
each valuable laces as Brussels or antique
fÂ»oint have been detached from the ground,
aid on silk or satin and allowed to form
part of the embroidery, often powdered
with paillettes. Expense certainly is sel
dom considered by the smart woman now
adays. Honiton lace is again in favor.
We will be glad to see it once more.
On the fronts of some of the newest
evening bodices are strings of pearls which
are caught up on the front with a hand
some ornament and jewel a la Tudor.
Satin is much used at present and many
of the latest gowns have thtir seams out
lined with steel and jet beads, the bodice
invariably showing a similar treatment.
The most fashionable of the moire vel
vaUnand moire moulle have a beautiful
silvary sheen, and numerous are the deli
cate shades in which tbev are to be had.
Many artificial flowers are used on ball
gowns; they are usually veiled in tulle.
Chatelaines of flowers are frequently
seen, and roses without foliage are a lad.
Never before has straw been so much
employed as an embroidery ; for instance, a
Paris dress, frotL one of "the most noted
houses is of black satin combined with
black velvet trimmed with straw, worked
with mother-of-pearl. The result may be
excellent, it certainly is novel if nothing
else. Shot and chameleon effects appear
in both materials and trimmings and now
form the groundwork of many floral
chines.
Purchase no red fabrics unless you must
have one luncheon gown, then have a ser^e
for the bouse, otherwise you will be the re
verse of smart, red having been completely
banished, and right glaa I am that it no
longer is worn in the evening, as delicate,
lovely gowns are faded looking affairs
when brought in contact with so strong a
hue. Crimson is used with good results
occasionally, as a cravat, and bunches of
red poppies are seen on numerous fans
and hats.
Now that tbe sleeves are decreasing in
size we may expect, by fall, to consider a
skirt four yards in circumference ample,
and as the sleeves diminish, so are the
revers shrinking and tbe collars are like
wise affected.
The principal difference between our
skirts this season and last is to be found
in the fronts, which are now plain and
tight over the hips, the fullness being all
at the back, a more becoming arrange
ment than formerly.
In Paris blue serge is being much used
and in England the light drab cloths so
much liked by French women is quite "the
thin*." I cannot understand tbe hold
alpaca and mohair has obtained on the
fashionable world, as for my part I would
prefer the simplest little cloth gown to the
handsomest mohair or alpaca one that
could be made. However, this season is
likely to see the last of these materials.
There has just been placed on the market
a delightful new weave of canvas of a crepe
like texture. It is extremely thin and
very expensive, so it will never become
common, a strong recommendation to
many.
For those who do not care for Tattcrsall
waistcoats, and yet do not wish to make
the extravagant outlay necessary for the
tulle and mousseline de soie ones, I would
suggest that they should have a waistcoat
made by a good woman of an excellent qual
ity of white silk or satin, for with this as
a foundation they can readily arrange
themselves ruffles of hemstitched or j
tucked muslin, which will wash perfectly
and c nable the economical to always be I
well supplied with effective and pretty
waistcoats. Pale blue, white, pink anil
lavender muslin can be used, and fre
quently the frills are edged with lace.
When a straight loose front is more be
coming the muslin can be tucked or in
crustea with lace, producing an excellent
effect. The foundation must, of course,
fasten down the back or at one side and
must be well boned.
The new shade of hyacinth blue is cer
tainly stylish, but becoming to but few.
Mauy shirt waists are being made up in '
silk and linen of this color, and with white
linen collars and cuffs, are great favorites.
Some manufacturers are trying to intro
duce rep, but I trust without success, as
it had never been a favorite of mine.
When mentioning my dislike to alpaca
and mohair I should have added that it
does make excellent petticoats for the
country and a good lining for skirts.
Fiom France have been sent out the
latest novelties in gloves. The backs are
elaborately sewn with a double twist of
purse silk^ intermixed with small beads.
In many cases these are gold, but some
times the three stripes each display a
different color â brown, blue and ruby,
tinted iridescent beads. They are to be
had in such a variety that one need never
have a pair that does not harmonize with '
their gowns in coloring. Highly colored
gloves in many of the so-called "latest
summer shades" should be let severely
alone.
Tnose who are about to furnish their
homes should remember that for a dining
room beautiful real old English oak is
never out ot style, and now antiquated
old oak Welsh "dressers," which take the
place of buffets or sideboards, are the rage
in London. They make admirable back
grounds for blue china, and old brass and
copper jugs and plates. Sometimes in
such rooms are placed "gate tables," which
are valued possessions. Rarely are more
t'-an two seen in such a room, as they are
of goodly size. Many halls also are fitted
in oak, and ereat is the variety to be
had in hall chairs and tables. The latest
tables are round, and have places for
china and books.
When oak is considered too dark aud
heavy, either Chippendale or Sherraton are
usually selected. Much bedroom furniture
is also made up in these styles. The toilet
tables having heart-shaped glasses are
much liked. Houses should be furnished
in harmony, but alas! how many are?
Avoid pretentious shams and purchase
good things when starting out to keep
house even if you can only have a few
handsome chairs and tables at first.
Those living in small houses are fre
quently at a loss to know how best to en
tertain their friends, so now East buffet
A PRINCESS GOWN.
luncheons are frequently given and are
fashionable functions. A large table in
the drawing-room is usually daintily
spread with snowy damask and adorned
with choice blossoms, bonbons, salted
almonds, etc., in cut glass or silver dishes.
On a side table may be arranged piles of
plates, knives, forks and spoons. The
guests are supposed to be seated at small
tables, but at many swell affairs they are
not. Then two of your friends can pour
chocolate and boullion at small tables.
Maids or waiters serve the lunch, which
usually does not consist of more than
eight courses. Such affairs are in great
vogue, being delightfully informal and
easily prepared, and as well-trained waiters
and waitresses can now be readily secured
here make entertaining a pleasure.
An English magazine has been asked to
start a competition and ask "What are the
first essentials of a gentlewoman?" A
number of bright women lately discussed
the question and one replieo* "By her
boots and gloves," and another said, "By
her skirt-binding." Well, a great deal can
be said on the subject as most of us have
certain very positive ideas.
Martyrs to seasickness will hear with
pleasure that the channel has been twice
crossed in rough weather by a wretched
sailor without unpleasant results after
taking "Yanatas." I should think it well
worth a tr.al, although constitutions are
variously affected.
Women who rely on their "cup of tea"
will be wise if they ever visit Venezuela to
take tea with them, as the natives regard
it with disfavor, and send to a drugstore
for it if one insists on having it, and the
quality obtainable is said by one who has
experimented to be "simply abominable
and like a dose of senna."
"Makcella."
FOR MEN.
There is a prediction that the vivid
greens of springtime, which have been re
produced for us in shirts and ties, are to be
displaced by an absurdly brilliant shade of '
violet. Truly, if ail predictions were veri- i
fied, we would be gorgeous to behold, but
violet will never enjoy great favor, as it is
very trying to the complexion.
A London tailor insists that knickers for
cycling should be made to taper, as he in
forms us that fullness just above the knee

No longer will a fashionable man be i
seen In a Norfolk jacket. It is a thing of
the past, and the loose rough sack coat is j
considered smart.
Him writes: '"Plain stockings with a !
tartan.' says an English contemporary, j
'have taken the place of the loud-pat- '
terned stockings, the tartan with a gaudy !
pattern on the part turned down.' Also,
The most fashionable shirts this season
wiil be soft-fronted, in pink and blue, and
the tie a plain sailor's knot.' All tnrs may
be the latest from 'Lunnon,' but for its
correctness I will not vouch."'
Polo seems to have more votaries here
than golf, however, such excellent courses !
can be had not only in this City, but
across the bay as well.
In good time it will become popular. It
should be noted that the golf held suit is
of tweed. In America sack coats are worn
in preference to the Norfolk jacket. A
recent English authority suggests a tweed
jacket, with two gussets in the back to al
iow easy and free play to the arm when
tbe wearer is driving; and this also does
away with the band at the bottom of the
knickers, there being in its place a single !
cloti strap. The cap is of tweed, the same ;
material as the suit. The shirt is of
Madras or cheviot. The hose have long- !
ribbed tops turned over, making a'â 
sort of heavy band just over the j
calf of the leg. They are of heavy I
worsted, in brown, or tans, or dark 'â 
mixtures, either plain or ribbed. The golf ,
chibs have special uniforms for receptions,
briirht red coats with gold buttons and
other insignia being the rule among the !
English and Scotch links. These uniforms j
should, of course, be worn on all formal i
occasions in the clubhouse or on match
days. And this rule is the general one for
meets â golfers and other oreanizations of
sporting men. The club dress uniform is

Blue serge is always worn in preference
to anything else for yachting suits. For
this purpose they are made with a reefer
for peajacket, in case the weather is bad.
Colored shirts are worn.
Duck trousers and black sack coats wiil
be the costumes seen on the tennis ground.
Another attempt is being made to intro
duce braid on evening trousers, a hideous
fashion which should not be tolerated.
The dress or evening coat in vogue ia of a
soft fine vicuna, smooth and with a tine
twill, or of soft fine corkscrew. It is freed
with silk.
A frock coat and gray trousers, top hat
and gloves of the new shade of tan are
worn to garden parties and informal re
ceptions during the summer. Last sum
mer on such occasions many gray cloth
frocks were seen. Patent leather shoes
are, of course, worn wheu so garbed.
On the seashore a morning lounge suit
should be worn, with a colored linen shirt
with a white collar and cuffs matching
the shirt. A straw hat is the only correct
chapeau.
An indigo blue serge suit of fine texture
is a very necessary and acceptable adai
tion to any man's wardrobe at this season
Bathing robes are still being made of
crasn or Turkish toweling. The slippers
match. Light colors are preferable, for
instance, those having a white ground,
with stripes of pale blue, pink and ecru
are becoming, or those in a solid color are
liked. The color should be delicate, and
it is well to remember that blue and ecru
retain their color better than pink.

The home is in an exceptionally good

old women residents, making a total of
136 as compared with 128 at the same time
in 1895, and varying in ane from 63, the
minimum for admission, to 91.
In the past year $50C0 was received as a
gift from Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, $500 from
the estate of Isaac Hecht, fit) from Mr.
"Weinstock of Sacramento, and finally
$7200, or $600 a month, from the Mary A.
Crocker trust.
Hut the more money, say the women,
the more possibilities for good work in the
home and the reception and care of addi
tional old people, for there are accommo
dations for 140.
A Parisian thief entered a cab without
baggage and directed the driver to convey
him to an address some two miles distant.
On the way thither he requested the driver
to halt at the shop of a certain dealer in
second-hand goods. Tne passenger en
tered the shop bearing in his arms a large
paper-covered parcel. He had npned open
tho cushions, stolen the horsehair and was
ready to sell it.
Ants have brains larger in proportion to
the size of their bodies than any other liv
ing creatures. They are endowed with a
high quality of instinct, display reasoning
ability and sood judgment, and possess
powers ot reflection and calculation.

SOME PECULIARITIES OF ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS,
BY "W. O. MORROW.
Possibly an American newspaper con
ducted on English lines would prove a?
grievous a failure as have all attempts to
introduce American newspaper methods
in London, but there is reason to doubt it
It is conceivable that the love of novelty
in America and the comparative absence
of that sentiment in England would wel
come a London-molded newspaper in this
country as a rich and pleasant diversion.
Let us imagine what a sensation would be
created by a newspaper which is content
with news a few days* old, and which does
not publish it until it is assured of its cor
rectness; which displays a total absence of
that greedy and hysterical hurry so char
acteristic of Americans; which has no
"scare heads" at all, and never resorts
to the practice of crowding the lirst
page with beginnings of thrilling news
stories broken at the bottom of a column
and carried over to some obscure part of
the paper, tnere to be hunted up
in an agony of impatience; which
in the presentation of its news shows a j
forthright purpose to instruct, a brutal di
rectness and sim jilicity of expression and a
total absence of that peculiarly American
and distinctively humorous practice of in
troducing what editors naively think are
"literary effects" in the presentation of
news, and which shows that in the or
dinary course of events the opinions of
trained specialists serving as editorial
writers are deerued far more important
and are more richly paid for than the
work of the ablest flash reporter in the
realm.
It is not likely that an American pub
lisher will soon appear with the shrewd
ness to discern in English journalistic
methods an opportunity to create a greater
sensation in this country than the hair
tearing, harrowing and tsoul- wearing meth
ods of those who think that thrill is the
beginning and the end of newspaper ethics.
A young American reporter niisjht sud
denly leap into fame and a high salary
by imitating the style of a London re
porter, merely by reason of tlw fact that
his work would be so novel. Unhappily,
American writers, particularly those for
the press, are getting further and further
away from those idioms which constitute
the true richness of the language ; and, as
Americans are insatiable readers, the evil
is taking a tierce hold on the whole body
of the people. It is not so in London.
English newspapers display the highest
elegance and finish in their editorial pages,
but the English reporters write the honest,
every -day language of the people, strong
and pure, and that is manifestly the only
kind suited to the presentation of news.
That idea is unknown in America. With
us the efforts to introduce in news those
grotesque qualities Known as "fine writ
ing" and "literary eftects" explain many
things constituting the weakness of our
method. If the English papers were any
less successful or influential than ours,
this violation of common-sense and good
taste on our part might be defensible.
Of course It is understood that this
criticism is not aimed at all American news
papers. There is here and there a con
spicuously meritorious paper that is not
offensively sensational and hysterical.
The New Yortc Sun and the San Francisco
Call are worthy examples of that class.
There is room for hope that their influence
is steadily working for the common good.
Being myself intensely American and
understanding that American journalism
is a perfect reflex of our people's tastes and
of our National temperament, and having
a certain affection for it as an incident of a
general condition not less admirable than
that observable in Great Britain, I feel
free to indulge in criticism' which 1 might
resent if it came from an Englishman.
As the language used by London report
ers is that of everyday life, it possesses a j
strength foreign to the diffuse and smooth j
writing of an American reporter. The
London reporter's English is none the less
good because it is direct and honest; it is
all the better for that.
Here is an illustration : In many Ameri
can morning papers it is the custom, in
narrating a happening of the previous
day, to obscure the adverb "yesterday"
by removing it as far at. possible from the
beginning of the opening statement This
often gives rise to curious blunders in syn
tax. The Englishman, recognizing the
plain fact that time is of the essence of
news, generally makes "yesterday" the
very fir9t word of the account. American
editors iiave a reason for not following that
sensible custom, but charity suggests that
it be not published here.
I have before me a single copy of a lead
ing London newspaper, and it is so ricn
in matter and suggestion that no trouble
is found in securing extracts with wlii( h
to illustrate the ideas here put forth.
Here is an item â style, head, punctuation
and all â disclosing a treatment radically
different from that which an American re
porter would have been required to give it :
A Nice Sos.â Lewis Parsons, seventeen, re
siding with his parents at 39, Millbank-street,
Westminster, was brought before Mr. Sheil on a
charge of violently assaulting his motner. â
Mrs. Â¥ arsons, whose upper lip was much cut
and swollen, said at mid-day on Wednesday she
wiis sitting in her kitchen, when her son caught
up a couple of meat-bones and threw them at
her face. The jagged end of one struck her on
the upper lip, cutting it through to the teeth,
and the other also struck her face.â Mr. Sheil :
Has he ever done anything of this sort be
fore?â Prosecutrix repLied that some time ago
the lad kicked her on the knee, and she was
laid up for three months in consequence.â
Mr. Shell (to prisoner) : What have you to say
for behaving in this way to your mother?â The
boy merely said he was sorry, and was sen
tenced to twenty-one days' hard labour, his
worship promising him six months it he aj>
peared again.
Its peculiarities are numerous. Its great
compactness, lucidity and completeness
are the most conspicuous. Parsons is not
"aged seventeen" or "seventeen years old"
or "seventeen years of age" ; he is "seven
teen," and that is easily understood. The
whole of d dark, strong picture is drawn
â with perfect intelligence in a few hard,
bold lines perfectly suited to it. No silly
attempts at pathos and no useless efforts
at "description" are made. This little
paragraph is the quintessence of art. So
jealous is the paper of its precious space
that it uses a side heaa, and instead of
breaking the line for a paragraph, it em
ploys the dash. No useless quotation
marks are used, because the meaning is
unmistakable without them. The narra
tion of this incident is as simple, direct
and effective as the summary administra
tion of justice with which it closes.
In the following is material that would
serve an American newspaper with mate
rial for several columns:
Central Criminal Court.â On Monday the
April Sessions of this Court will commence,
and the business is not so heavy as was ex
pected, although there are several cases which
are expected to occupy considerable time.
There are forty-nine new charges for trial, in
respect of which about eighty prisoners have
been committed, but independent of these
cases there are several standing over from the
previous sessions. Seaman, who has been
charged with the Whitechapel murder, has
been committed upon the coroner's inquisi
tion, but as the magisterial inquiry is not com
plete the crs2 will not be ready for trial this
sessions. There is but one other charge of
murder â a child murder case. The eight
judges' eases include the masked burglars'
charge from Lewisham. The Lord Chief Jus
tice, Mr. Justice Day, and Mr. Justice Grant
bam are on the rota to attend.
Really the best reporting In American
newspapers is done by commercial report
ers. Even they, however, must lay aside
their crisp and intelligent conciseness
when the market feels a flurry, and then
they launch into "literary effects," as
though it were possible for an educated
mind to imagine any connection between
literature and news of any kind. Excel
lent as is the American commercial re
porter's ordinary work, it is rarely that
be produces so exquisite a gem in English
as the following :
A Reuters telegram, dated Berlin, states
that the Money Market to-aav showed a hard
ening tendency. Liiscount bills were offered
to a large extent, while discount noun's ob
served a certain hesitation. Notwithstand
ing, stocks exhibited strength, especially
Italians, ?or which a sanguine spirit was en
tertained. Local stocks were very well main
tained. The closing was firm all round.
Still another order of reporting is found
in the sporting columns of the English
paper. Here is a specimen :
Cricket Match at Kingston.â An amusing
cricket match was played yesterday afternoon
on Thames " Ditton village green, between a
team of Surrey cricketers, captained by Rich
ardson, and twelve comic entertainers. The
weather was cold, but there was a large attend
ance of spectators, and the Band of the 3d and
4th Battalions of the East Surrey Regiment
played selections of music. Richardson's
team won by fifty-five runs, having obtained
iotÂ». The match was for the benefit of the
local Cottage Hospital.
Such expressions as "attendance of spec
tators" and "the band *.* * played
selections of music" would look odd in an
American newspaper, but besides being in
teresting on the score of . quaintness, they
are better English than one might suppose
from a glance.
Here is an extract from a report of some
horse races. Only so much is quoted as
serves to exhibit the style, but the whole
account is not 1 a quarter as . long as an
American paper would have made it:
A deal of rain fell in Northampton during
yesterday morning, but this did not impair the
i going at the Northampton meeting. The after
noon, though dull and threatening at times, re
mained fine, and the company was an excellent
one in all departments. The proceedings were
ushered in with the Pytchley Welter Handicap,
which only attracted a quartette to the post, and
of these Ilornpool was installed favourite, but
cut up in very disappointing fashion, Bevil
scoring a popular victory in the Rothscnild
colours. Chevern, Sable, and Daily Bread were
the absentees of the eleven entered for the Castle
Plate, for which the Lincoln winner, Watch
Tower, settled down an equal favourite with
I Diplomatic, and won cleverly, but Dulled up
! lame, being afterwards purchased at auction
by Arthur Nighliugall lor 250 guineas. A big
! entry for the Althorp Park Stake* only yielded
three runners, and of these Pastoral, who ran
1 prominently in : the Brocklesby Stakes, won
! easily. The Earl Spencer's Plate came next.
I and this attracted a field of thirteen to the
; post, of whom Bethisy had the call in the
wagering throughout, with Seaport and Propo
sition next in demand. There was a tiresome
delay owing to the reported bolting of Queen
of the Chase, the race eventually being started
without her. Bethisy failed to get placed, but
Proposition, an own sister to Euclid, won
easily.
The records of time are given in an ap
pended table. The compactness of the
foregoing account is as charming as the
simplicity of the language employed.
A seemingly inexplicable American in
consistency is the mad hurry of the people
on one hand and their greedy demand for
enormous newspapers and dilute news on
: the other. It would seem that an Eng
lishman, who is never in a hurry and has
abundant leisure, would be the one to de
| mand that sore of journalism. Perhaps
jan explanation of the American re
quirement is the fact that an issue
;of a newspaper contains only one or
j a few matters of news that a sub
i scriber cares to read, and that he wants
them presented as fully as possible. Hence
the American paper must present full re
ports on all subjects in order to meet the
requirements of ail classes of readers. If
i this be the explanation we must infer
, either that Englishmen read newspapers
| less than Americans or that they read as
I much and thus acquire a wider range of
j information. 'Whichever of these views
j may be taken, it is evident that the Amer
ican plan tends to compel American read
ers to pursue very limited lines of reading.
! This is a misfortune. A few papers, the
San Francisco Call among them, obviate
this evil by maintaining a special depart
ment presenting all the local news in
I short paragraphs, the fuller reports appear-
I ing in other parts of the paper.
At .Sutro Baths To-l>ay.
To-day the survivors of the burned ship Re
public will appear at Sutro Baths and give a

SOME COMMON EQUINE AILMENTS.
Miss Russell Treats in a Lucid Way Many of the
Diseases of the Hoof,
We considered last week some maladies
that affect the ankle joints of horses. To
day we will consider those that attack the
hoofs and feet. These are many and,
usually, serious, for the old saying is a
true one, "No feet, no horse." A horse
with one lame foot is as useless as one
with no feet at all, and as most of the
troubles with equine feet are insidious in
tneir beginning, if is well to be able to de
tect them in their earliest stages, when
they are easiest of remedy. The driver
who is unable to tell when his horse is
going square and true, with each foot
doing its share of work, ought not to be
intrusted with the care of an animal.
This point cannot be too strongly empha
sized. Some horses "hitch" in their gait
when pushed beyond the rate of speed at

which they can comfortably travel, but as
a general thing any irregularity of pace
when a horse is traveling should cause at
tention to be attracted to his feet.
In particular the feet of our San Fran
cisco horses should be systematically
looked to, for our pavements are enough
to cause disease in the soundest feet. They
are particularly productive of corns, which,
in a horse's foot, are not tbe same thing
that cause so much suffering to the human
race. The foot of a horse is the seat of in
numerable minute blood vessels that, un
der strain, are very liable to rupture.
When one does this a "corn" is the result
and appears as a small, reddish and very
sensitive spot in the sole of the foot and
under the shoe. The horse limps quickly
and sharply under these circumstances,
and the corn should be attended to. A
good many blacksmiths will recommend
bar-shoes as a remedy for this difficulty,
but if the horse-owner is wise and does not
desire to drive an animal with contracted
hoofs he will shun this device, for it is fu
tile to cure the corn and is productive of
much mischief.
Bad shoeing, as well as hard driving and
rough roads, is a frequent cause of corns.
Close paring and careless rasping of
the hoof, an unevenly set shoe or a
shoe allowed to remain too long on the
foot wil! produce this difficulty. The
horse inclined to it should be shod with
periplantar shoes with tips or else with
three-quarter shoes, and in no case should
the frog ever be pared in. shoeing. In
fact the shoeing should be such as will
let the whole of the frog come upon the
ground, in some cases this is not possi
ble, but as a general thing it is feasible.
The most smiths will insist that it is not.
In any event tbe horse snould be shod so
that no pressure comes on the heel where
the corn usually appears. Besides receiv
ing proper shoeing the animal p.hould be
given medical treatment with a view to
toning up the vascular system. Arnica
anil bryonia are both good remedies for
this purpose and external application of
the tincture of arnica to the seat of the
difficulty will relieve the pain and even
lessen the tendency to corns. lithe ani
mal iÂ« where he can conveniently be per
mitted to go barefoot during treatment so
much the better.
Quittor is a painful and serious trouble
that often results from a neglected corn or
from puncture in shoeing, or from some
other cause. It is a burrowing abscess,
which works its way up toward the coro
net. I have known a quittor to be caused
by a bit of gravel getting into a nail-hole
left from a previous shoeing, working up
into the hoof and setting up suppuration.
If the trouble is discovered before suppur
ation actually begins tincture of arnica,
one part, to four of water, used frequently
to bathe the wounded part will usually
affect a cure in a few days. The shoe
should be taken off and the animal not
worked. If there is laceration of the soft
parts, as sometimes occurs when the
trouble is the result of a wound, calendula
lotion will be found better than arnica.
It should be used in tbe same manner.
If suppuration has set in the wound
must be opened from below. If caused by a
nail or from a corn the sole should be pÃred
and the horn of the wall rasped away so
as to relieve pressure. Hot fomentations
to the foot and a generous poultice should
be applied, and when the abscess is open
it should be thoroughly cleansed daily
with a strong solution of crude carbolic
acid. Be sure that this is made to penetrate
the entire length of the wound, which
will, in many cases, be the full depth of
the hoof. A plug of absorbent cotton

Periplantar Shoeing.
saturated in the solution and passed
through the opening by means of a probe
is the most effectual method of cleansing.
If the trouble is very serious it is highly
desirable to summon a veterinary sur
geon, if one is to be had. but otherwise, if
you wish to save your horse to usefulness,
the measure taken must be energetically
and faithfully persevered in, and the shoe
should not be replaced for a long time,
and then with great caution.
Wounds of the frog and sole of the foot
by stones, glass or sharp instruments, will
usually need to be pared out by a black
smith. If they bleed, they should be
padded with tow, and on general princi
ples, if a horse's hoof is punctured and no
other remedy is at hand, it is a good thing
to apply turpentine freely aud frequently.
Sometimes this is all that is necessary.
Thrush is a trouble often seen among
our heavy horses. It is generally caused
by stable carelessness, as when the horse
is allowed to stand in a dirty stall, or in
moist litter. It does not usually cause
lameness, but there is an unpleasant dis
charge from the cleft of the frog, and the
cleft deepens and looks like a crack. In
time the disease advances until it becomes
canker, when it is very stubborn and can
only be cured by skilled professional treat
ment.
With a little reasonable care, however,
and common observation on the part of the
horse's owner, the trouble, even if once al
lowed to begin, should never reach this
stage. Strong carbolic lotion is the best
remedy. It should be used three times a
day and the stall kept perfectly clean. The
disease is almost always caused by filth in
the stall and neglect to keep the animal's
feet clean. It most frequently attacks the
hind feet. If there is lameness, as some
times does occur, hot fomentations and
charcoal poultices should he used. As a
preventive, the hoof should be kept dry as
possible, the frogs left intact in shoeing,
and, if feasible, the walls of the hoof low
ered a little to bring extra pressure on the
frog. In any Â«-vent thinner shoes should
be used until a cure is effected.
Sand-crack is n trouble very easily pro
duced by the violent exertion required of
San Francisco horses, both in pulling and
in holding back, on our steep hills. It
may occur quite suddenly. It commences
at the upper part of the hoof and extends
down. Then it penetrates inward to the
sensitive hoof, causing great pain and
marked lameness. Theshoe should be re
moved at once and the. horn rasped away
from the crack, to relieve pressure. Then
soak in warm water and poultice. If
lameness continues a veterinary should be
consulted, as it is likely there is suppura
tion, but otherwise the case may be easily
treated by an amateur. The wound
should be dressed with some antiseptic
dressing, retained by a bandaee. In time
the part will harden, when the shoe
may be put on and gentle exercises
given. In reshoeing, a portion of the
wall below the crack should be rasped
down to relieve pressure of the shoe and a
notch should be burned above the crack.
This, with a sharp blister applied to the
coronet, will expedite the growth of new
horn. Cantharides ointment is a con
venient and efficacious application for thu
blister. If the horse is worked at all the
crack should be protected with a covering
of tar and tow strongly and firmly held by
straps about the hoof.
There are other affections of the feet of
horses which are seen every day on our
streets and roads, but they are such as are
the result of disease and troubles that can
only be treated by a veterinary, and which
usually render a horse permanently un
sound, even when he is able to do a small
amount of work. These I have not touched
upon, as I have aimed only to speak of
such defects and diseases as can be over
come in the everyday treatment of the
animal. Of these latter a common and
noticeable one is contracted hoofs. This
is sometimes natural to the horse's con
formation, in which case it does no
harm, but foul litter, excessive feeding,
irregular exercise and faulty shoeine
are among the causes of the diffi
culty when it occurs in horses with
naturally healthy feet. The first symp
toms are shuffling of the feet when in
motion. If a horse suddenly takes to

stumbling, who has heretofore, been sure
footed, - look to his feet. There will be
noticed narrowing of the heel in one or I
both forefeet, especially of the inner heel, 1 j
Sometimes the sole will appear hollow and
contracted and the foot is pinched until
the interstices on either side of the frog
have appeared. The horse stands with
one forefoot in advance of the other shift
ing from time to time, if both feet are
affected.
If possible, the animal should be left
barefooted for a wliile. Otherwise the
shoes should be carefully adapted to the

Wants Some Delay.
Louis Duprat is suing to have the Kehrlein
Opera Company restrained from purchasing a
lot on Howard and Sixth streets on which to
erect a $79,000 opera-house. He saya ip bis
complaint that the idea was to contract no ex
penses until $60,000 worth of tbe stock had
been subscribed. He wants the court there
fore to compel a delay. The plan was to pay
iWO.OOO in stock to the owner of the lot, Emil
Kehrlein, and to mortgage the property for
the remainder.
IT IS A MONSTER,
A Steer Which Promises to Grow
to the Size of an Elephant.
WICHITA, Ka.\s., May 6.â A monster
steer which is owned by Charles Payne, a
dealer iD wild animals and curious, is at
tracting the attention of the curious in
this part of the country. Mr. Payne came
into possession of the animal, now 3 years
old, about six months ago. Its growth
since that time has been phenomenal, and
the question is asked Mr. Payne many
times a day, "When is it ever going to
stop growing?" The steer is now six feet
and four inches high and eleven feet long,
or seventeen feet long counting from the
,tip of its tail. It weighed only 1800
pounds three months ago. Its present
weight is 2300 pounds, and if it continues
to grow as it has in the past six months it
will some day be as big as a full-grown ele
phant.
Cattlemen pronounpe it one of the great
est freaks known in the stock line. They
say it will continue to grow until it is
seven or eight years old, and that when it
â is fully grown, it will have attained a
weight of from 4000 to 6000 pounds. The
giant is perfectly symmetrical in its devel
opment, and is colored and marked like a
Jersey. Mr. Payne has not offered it for
sale, and says he intends to wait and see
how bie it gets.
Only one other such freak has been
known, and that was the famous "Kansas
Queen," a very large heifer that was shown
around the country as a side show atttac
tion. and was purchased by Adam For
paugh for |5000. It had previously netted
its owner a protit of $13,000.
Respite for Thompson.
"Kid" Thompson, the train-wrecker, will not
be hanged on May 22, the date set by his last
sentence. Chief Justice Beatty has granted a
writ ot probable cause, staying the execution
of the judgment until further order of the
court. There is another appeal pending, hence
the stay. Thompson appealed both from the
judgment and from an order denying a new
trial. The judgment was affirmed, and the
Supreme Court holds that the lower court nas
no jurisdiction until the second appeal haÂ«
been decided.
