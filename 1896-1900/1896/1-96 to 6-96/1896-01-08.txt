AN INTERVIEW
WITH JAMESON

Response to Imploring
Appeals.
THOUGHT MANY IN PERIL
Could Have Beaten the Boers If
Johannesburg Had Made an
Effort to Help.
EXPECTED AID DID NOT COME.
Invaders Fought Until Exhausted and
Ammunition Had All Been
Spent.
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 7.â A dispatch to
the Central News, dated Johannesburg,
January 3, gives a bri. ; f an inter
view with Dr. Jameson, who was sent as a
prisoner to Pretoria:
"I oniy crossed the frontier," said the
doctor, 'because of the urgent appeals
made by the inhabitants of Johannesburg,
and because 1 fully Leiieved that large
numbers of my countrymen and country
women were in d;r< peri! of their lives. I
could have beaten the Boers if the people
of Johannesburg had made any effort to
help theniseives, which I was led to expect
they vrouitl do. Help did not reach us at
Erugersdorp, and we could not break
through the Boer lines.
"We fought until we â were dropping to
the ground exhausted and our ammunition
had been spont. If the men of Johannes
burg had destroyed the railroad to Krugers
dor] . which they could easily have done,
it would have prevented the supplies of
ordnance being taken to the entrenched
, which enabled them to hold out
I our attacks. 7 '

A Letter Rebuking -Emperor William.
for His Attitude.
LONDON, EhÂ©., .lan. 7. -The Westmins
ter Gazette says the Queen has written a
letter to the Emperor of Germany, rebuk
ing him for his attitude in regard to the
Transvaal, especially in the matter of the
< â¢ ngntuiatory message which his Majesty
ser.t to President K7u per.
Hercules Robinson, Governor of
Cape Colony, has wired Mr. Chamberlain,
Colonial Â»Secreiary, from Pretoria, under
yesterday's date, that an order has been
issued directing the officers of the British
South Africa Company in charge of the
ordnance and ammunition at Buluwayo
and Fort Salisbury to hand the same over
to an imperial orticer. Orders were also
sent on January 2 to Buluwavo calling
upon all citizens to maintain law and
order. This order was faithfully obeyed.
Tiie excitement will be allayed, Governor
Robinson says, when it is known that Ur.
Jameson L.nd his comrades have been re
leased.
The Bt James Gazette says: "We would
rather face a rupture with Germany than
to renounce the stipulation of the conven
tion of l-> 4. that any international ar
rangement made by the Bonth African
republic requires the consent and ratifica
tion of Great Britain. 1 '
Political circles in London maintain that
if it be true thai, the Emperor of Germany
has promised to recognize the independ
ence of the Transvaal republic by ap
pointing a German resident instead of a
Consul at Pretoria it may mean war be
tween Great Britain ;<nd Germany.
T:e Johannesburg Standard has cabled
London, under the date of January 3, that
a revulsion of feeling lias sot in at Johan
nesburg, and that the reform leaders are
loudly denounced for their desertion of
Dr. Jameson.
"It was a mob revolution," the Standard
eaid, "in which the main population did
not join."
Sir Hercules Robinson, Governor of
Cape Colony, is now at Pretoria.

England Agitated by the lieeidxd Action
of Germany.
I NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 7.â A special
cable to the Sun from London says: Dis
patches received in London after midnight
from Berlin reiterate, in terms which aU
moÂ«t compels belief, Germany's intention
to declare the independence of the Trans
vaal republic.
The London morning papers just issued
credittheannouncementand they interpret
that it means war. It should be said in
explanation of this interpretation that the
editors of the principal London journals
were invited to meet Mr. Chamberlain
yesterday. The results of the inspiration
received at these interviews are words that
will send the country to arms as soon as
tbe.V are read.
There is no longer any attempt to con
ceal the fact that war is not only possible,
bat probable. Even the radical Daily
Chronicle, in a leader fully indorsing the
Government policy, says aUhe outset:
The tension is so extreme at the present
moment that every man on these islands
should feel resting upon him a heavy
sense of responsibility. We assume that
the defensive forces of the empire will be
His plainly intimated in the inspired
editorials that England is prepared to deal
both with ti,e German Emperor and with
any dictator, plainly meaning Mr.
Rhodes, who may assert himself in British
f-outh Africa. These allusions strengthen
the belief that a revolution has been at
tempted or is now existing in Cape Colony
under Rhodes' leadership.
THE SITVAIIOS ORAVR.
I'rotjHct of a Clash Between England
unit fir rtmt 11.7.
LONDON, KnÂ«.., .Un. 7.â The Times
tviil to-morrow publish a dispatch from
Berlin saying that the situation is still
viewed by those competent to judge as
being much graver than appears on the
surface or than the actual relations be
tween Great Britain and Germany seem to
show. Dr. Beelaerts yon Blokland, the
Minister of the Transvaal to Germany,
and Dr. Leyds, Secretary of State of the
Transvaal, bare daily conferences with the
Foreign Cilice omcials. It may be
assumed that whatever course the Trans
vaal decides to adopt it will be largely
shaped in accordance with their reports to
Pretoria.
It is stated that Dr. yon Blokland and
Dr. Leyds are also in frequent communica
tion with the French Embassador in Ber
lin, whose view* are reported to accord
with those of Germany relative to the
guarantees to be demanded to secure the
future independence of the Transvaal.
Tiie decision to land German marines at
Lorenzo Marquez and to march them to
the Transvaal was not a mere threat. The
news of I>r. Jameson's defeat arrived just
in time to avert the dispatch of final
instructions to that effect.
The writer of the dispatch declares that
this necessarily involves the existence of
prior agreement between Berlin, Lisbon
and Pretoria, and shows that Germany for
some time lias been maturing schemes to
arrest the progress of British ascendancy
in South Africa.
He adds that there is still in some quar
tors in Berlin a desire to avert irreparable
estrangement with England, but that the
anti-English current is running so strong
that it may carry the Government into
deeper and stormier waters than those who
swing around with it anticipated.

England Hill Send Strong Jte-enforce-
tttentu tit Once.
LONDON. Esq., JaÂ«. 7.â The Telegraph
will to-morrow say that the Government
has decided to send to Cape Town as soon
as possible strong re-enforcements of cav
alry and infantry. It adds that a second
regiment which is under orders to return
home from India will stop at Cape Town,
while other regiments selected from the
First Army Corps in England will shortly
leave for that place.
The Telegraph further says that a first
class British cruiser has been ordered to
proceed to Delagoa Bay.
A dispatch received to-day from Johan
nesburg, dated January 2, says it has
transpired that upon the arrival of the
news of Dr. Jameson's advance, Mr. Eloff,
President Kruger's grandson, rode unat
tended to meet the British South Africa
Company's force with a view to persuad
ing them to return; He met them at
Zwaartlaagte, and vainly urged them to
retire. He was placed under arrest until
the following day, when ho was liberated
and his horse returned to him. Dr. Jame
son retained his arms, telling him to call
for them at the Government offices in Pre
toria.
The Daily News will to-morrow publish
a dispatch from Vienna saying that the
â¢ rcrman Government, fearing that
Emperor William's message to President
Kruger would offend Emperor Francis
Joseph, has explained to Count Gelu
chowsky. Minister of Foreign Affairs, that
Emperor William did not intend to offend
England. His message was merely meant
to encourage the free states of South
Africa to maintain their independence. A
similar message has been sent to Rome,
where, it is stated, the opposition intended
to use the incident against a renewal of
the triple alliance.
IW.L JCJSLLXQUIBM ARSIS.
Uitlanaera Heady to Comply With the
lieiiiniMltt Made.
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 7. â Hercules
Robinson, Governor of Cape Colony, cables
from Pretoria, capital of the Transvaal,
under date of to-day, that he has received
a message from the reform committee at
Johannesburg stating that the Uitlanders
have resolved to comply with the demand
of the Transvaal Government that they
relinquish their arms. The pÂ°ople, the
committee added, are placing themselves
unreservedly in his hands, being confident
that he will see that justice is done them.
Sir Hercules then quotes a message sent
by Sir Jacobus Dewet, the Bri&sh political
agent at Pretoria, to President Kruger,
containing the reform committee's formal
resolution declaring that the committee
had instructed Â« its followers to lay down
their arms, relying on the Transvaal Gov
ernment to maintain order and protect
life. The resolution requests that the
armed burghers in the vicinity of Johan
nesburg be removed.
Sir Jacobus Dewet added to his message
that he was convinced that the foreigners
would*abandon their arms without fur
ther difliculty, and urged that the republic
operate with the committee for a day or
two in restoring the normal condition of
affairs in Johannesburg.
Sir Hercules concludes his dispatch by
saying he hopes now to be able to confer
with President Kruger and the executive
council relative to the prisoners and the
redressing of the grievances of the foreign
residents of Johannesburg.

Accused of Cowardice tn J\'ot Atsiating
Dr. ilunir.inii.
LONDON, Exo., Jan. 7.â Lord Salisbury
received Mr. Chamberlain and the Ger
man Embassador at the Foreign Office to
day. The interview between Count yon
Hazfeldt and the Prime Minister lasted
for bait an hour. Subsequently Lord Sal
isbury received Baron de Courcel, the
French Embassador. After these inter
views Lord Salisbury started for Hatrield
House, hi s home in Hertfordshire.
A dispatch from Cape Town says that
after nightfall on the clay of the battle be
tween Dr. Jameson and his followers and
the Boers the latter used search lights,
themselves remaining under cover and re
lying upon their sharpshooters to pick off
Jameson's men.
The Westminster Gazette has a dispatch
from Cape Town, which says: A general
feeling of nauseating contempt for the
Uitlanders of Johannesburg exists here.
This feeling is based upon their obvious
cowardice in sitting quietly down after
luring Dr. Jameson into his blunder and
offering him no assistance whatever. Im
mediately after the invading forces offered
resistance to the Boers, the stores were
closed, trade became stagnant and women
and children began leaving for the coast
in coal, cattle and horse trucks and every
kind of vehicle available. The scene at
the railway station was indescribable.
A dispatch from Johannesburg, dated
January ], says that a deputation sent to
Pretoria had concluded a three days'
armistice in order to permit the arrival of
Governor Robinson, who was expected to
arrive in Pretoria on January 4. In the
meantime the National Union of Ut
landers controlled the town.
A proclamation issued by Governor
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, JANUARY 8, 1596.
Uncle Samâ" Really, I ought to recognize this young woman,"
Robinson has been published warning
British subjects in the Transvaal against
joining Dr. Jameson, who, the proclama
tion declares, has been guilty of armed
invasion of the territory of a friendly
state.
FOR A FJLTIXG SQUAMiOS.
A Xaval Force to Be Dispatched to Dela
gon J(aj/.
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 7.â The Times to
morrow will say that orders have been
sent to Portsmouth, Devonport and Chat-
I ham for the immediate placing in com
! mission of six ships to form a flying squad
ron. It is understood that captains for
the vessels have already been chosen. The
object is obviously to have an additional
squadron to go anywhere. The squadron
will be composed of two first-class battle
ships and two first and two. second-class
cruisers. The names of the vessels are yet
unknown, but there is hardly a question
that either the Royal Oak or the Revenge,
how at Portsmouth, will hoist a pennant.
The Endymion and the Hesus, now at
Chatham, are likely to be two of the
cruisers selected. The paper adds that it
has also been decided to dispatch a naval
force to Delftgoa Bay, but whether it will
be composed of vessels from the cape or
East Indian squadron is ur.known;
Commenting upon these naval prepara
tions the Times will say it hopes that, as
nothing can be gained by keeping the
Mediterranean squadron at Salonica, it
will i-hortiy be ordered to concentrate
where it can be more immediately avail
able in case of need.
Relative to the report abo at Germany
ordering marines to the Transvaal, the
Times refuses to believe the report until it
shall be proved that Portugal consented
for them to pass through her territory.
It adds, however, that it would not be sur
prised to learn that efforts had been made
to tempt her to such disloyalty to a
friendly power and old ally.

How Great Britain and the

Settle.
NEW TREATY FAVORED.
Correspondent Norman Urges a
Plan to Check All Con

ARBITRATION THE KEYNOTE.
Americans Firm in the Support of
Cleveland in the Venezuelan
Dispute.
LONDON, ESQ., Jan. 7.â The Chroni
cle's Washineton correspondent, Henry j
Norman, cables as follows,
"There is a heroic way of settling the
whole difficulty, fraught with honor to
both Governments and with results of
priceless wjyrth to both peoples. The pres
ent delay consists in the fact that the j
United States Government considers itself j
in honor bound to insist upon a certain ;
course, which the British Government I
considers itself in honor bound to refuse I
to adopt. Every day spent here has con- |
vinced me more strongly that it is impos
sible to exaggerate the seriousness of such
an international situation. If the British I
public is misled by the optimistic senti- !
nients of New York It may rind itself sud
denly face to face with appalling clanger.
If the American Government acts only in
the belief that because Great Britain is
threatened with a European crisis there
fore she will knuckle down to any Ameri
can demand it may suddenly discover that
the Europeau crisis has blown over and
that war with England is on its hands.
M I once more repeat my solemn convic
tion that the overwhelming majority of
the American people will support their
Government in war on behalf of the prin
ciple of arbitration where American inter
ests are bolieved to be involved. At the
same time I positively reassert that the
President and Cabinet earnestly desire an
amicable settlement, and individual mem
bers of the administration confess that
they utterly fail to comprehend the reason
for England's attitude of mere blunt re
fusal. In all the Government depart
ments nere the situation is regarded as
very serious despite every effort made on
behalf of peace.
"Now, the kernel of the dispute being
the principle of arbitration, the solution
may be fnund therein aiso. If Lord Salis
bury will say that, although he must
maintain his refusal to arbitrate on Vene
luela by itself, Le is prepared to conclude
a treaty with the United States under
which all questions failing oi diplomatic
settlement shall be submitted to arbitra
tion and that tnis of course would include
Venezuela, as the greater includes the
less, the American Government I know
will receive this communication with
warm sympathy. Herein is a dignified
and indeed the most simple and friendly
escape from the deadlock.
"Remember that a resolution to this
effect was adopted by Congress on April 4,
LB9O, and responded to by a resolution of
the House of Commons, supported in its
j decision by Mr. Gladstone on June 16,
I 1893. A second joint resolution of Con
\ press was introduced in trie Senate by
j Senator Allison on June 20, 1894, and re
| ferred to the committee on Foreign Kela-
I tions, where it still remains.
"Two things block the way. The first is
that if any arbitration treaty was ever
! under discussion it was laid aside when
i Congress, by refusing to pay that $425,000,
I temporarily invalidated the Paris Bering
Sea commission award. But as I have al
ready cabled, a treaty is partly concluded to
America, Canada and the British Embas
sador in Washington have all assented,
placing this matter in a direct way of set
tlement. I observe that the statement is
to-day cabled from London thut this
treaty is blocked by Canada's refusal. The
statement is entirely baseless. Canada
has formally and finally agreed. It only
awaits the^assent of the Foreign Office for
this treaty to become operative. I re
assert there is both surprise and regret felt
here at the delay. It is urgently desirable
that this treaty be pressed forward. As
soon as this is done the first difficulty will
have been removed.
"The second difficulty is the English
feeling that any action taken now would
appear to be due to American threats. In
reply to this it is quite certain that neither
Mr. Cleveland nor Mr. Olney consider
themselves to be threatening England.
They only desired, after years of fruitless
diplomatic discussion, to make the atti
tude of their own country clear beyond
the chance of further misunderstanding.
If Lord Salisbury has any doubts upon
this pi.int an inquiry through the regular
diplomatic channels to Mr. Bayard or Sir
Julian Pauncefote will, I am convinced,
dispel the notion that the American Gov
ernment deliberately adopted a menacing
attitude improper in diplomatic commu
nication. Moreover, if Lord Salisbury is
aggrieved by the expressions of the Ameri
can Government the American Govern
ment in its turn considers itself legiti
mately aggrieved hy Lord Salisbury's tone
and his virtual pooh-poohing a joctrine
which they had formerly declared they
regarded as vital to the National welfare.
Therefore the sentiments balance each
other, and there is every ground for mutual
agreement and assurance that no offense
was intended.
"These two are the only things in the
path leading to a grand recognition before
the whole world of the principle of arbi
tration between civilized nations. The
British public is ready; I am confident
that the American public is equally ready,
and I know the American Government
is ready. This being* so what blocks the
way to an almost imnediate removal of
Venezuela from the field of international
discussion and the complete restoration of
cordial relations between the two people
who, while only too ready to tight for
principle, are even more ready to agree on
a civilized settlement henceforth and for
ever? If Lord Salisbury is able to move
diplomatically in the direction indicated,
it is certain that the meeting of the Vene
zuelan commission would be instantly ad
journed until the time was ripe for com
mon discussion of the question, when the
treaty should become law. I will only
add if it were my iast word it would be a
lamentable mistake for England to be
lieve that there is any division of opinion
worth considering in this country. Wash
ington, far more than Now York, is the
pulse of the United states, and I have
been feeling that pulse for over a week,
and I assert, despite criticism or contra
diction, that America will speak with
practically one voice in support of the
Cabinet in the Venezuelan matter. If
Lord Salisbury decides that it is impossi
ble to take any step let him and England
at least recognize what is the alternative."
The Times' editorial, cabled to the
papers here to-day, is calculated to pro
duce a great and most favorable effect. A
few more such wise, conciliatory and
statesmanlike utterances on both sides
and the nations will be marching hand in
hand down the Christian road of peaceful
negotiation.
Commenting on the foregoing dispatch
the Chronicle will to-morrow say :
"The vital and absorbing feature of the
controversy is that America desires arbi
tration and we cannot refuse the request.
It is slowly, we. hope surely, entering the
minds of our statesmen that in order to do
justice to the American case we must look
at tne Monroe doctrine from the American
point of view. Here the hair-splitting of
ingenious lawyers and academic essayists
help very little. We have to take into ac
count a deep-rooted National sentiment,
which ha 3 a way of getting itself recog
nized in policy and in action without the
sanction of theoretical rules.
"Lord Salisbury may argue this, that
the American doctrine is not incorporated
in Vhe code of international law. The
American answer is: 'What we call inter
national law is merely the customs ob
served by European states in their rela
tions with each other, which have been de
termined by the dominant powers.'
"Eneland lias been foremost as a maker
of international law. It requires no ex
ceptional gift of perception to see that the
United States aspires to the same leading
role in politics on the American continent.
England filled Europe with glory and was
herself a benefit to mankind in the period
of Napoleonic wars. The international
law which is to govern the American con
tinent is in progress of formation, and we
cannot shut our eyes to the fact that since
the United States is th,e dominant power
on that continent, they will not fail to
exercise that paramount influence which
is incidental to the position."
ARBITRATION IS PROPER.
An English I'rofrsnor Who Indorses
Uticlr Sam.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Jan. 7.âProfes
sor W. Hudson Shaw of Oxford Univer
sity, in speaking to-day of the Venezuelan
controversy between England and the
United States, expressed some opinions of
the feeling over the question in nis coun
try that are at variance with the idea that
prevails here of the position of Great
.Britain.
"I am only eight days from England
and was there when the war scare over the
Venezuelan nffair first started," he said.
"Being a university extension lecturer and
constantly going from city to city I had
unusual opportunities of meeting all
classes of the people of England in many
sections of the country. I am sure I
know the sentiment of the people on the
matter.
"President Cleveland's message came to
the English people like a thunderbolt out
of a clear sky. The feeling there was oue
of unutterable astonishment that any
trouble could occur between England and
the United States. This feeling pervaded
all classes. The feeling of the English
people for their American cousins is year
by year becoming more sympathetic, and
among educated people in England the
thought of war' with the United States
seems impossible.

Spanish Volunteers and Citizens Pre
pared to Join the Insurgents
at a Signal.
LONDON, Ess., Jan. 7.â The Times will
to-morrow publish a dispatch from Mad
rid stating that despite official denials of
the report that Captain-General Campos
will resign his command in Cuba, public
opinion accepts as a fact the possibility of
his handing over the active command of
the operations against the insurgents to a
younger general while he retains the posi
tion of Governor. It is well known that tha
health of Marshal Campos is not robust.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 7.â The
Spanish Minister received to-night a tele
gram from Madrid stating that Mar.Â«h:il
Campos, in a telegram received there this
morning, bays:
"The main body of the enemy hag
marched to the province of Pinar del Kio.
I have advanced the columns of Generals
Yaldez, Garcia, Navarro, Echague and
Luque to follow them. I have the other
columns on the railroad between Havana
and Batabano. They will take rations
and proceed to-morrow in a parallel line to
occupy the line from Marie! to Arteraisa.
"The columns of Pratz, Galvis, Fort Al
dacoa and the battalions of Valercia and
Espana are chasing the small bands that
are burning cane and committing other
depredations. The situation in Cuba from
a military point of view remains un
changed. The insurgents have proceeded
west without daring to stop in any place,
and are avoiding all encounters. Nothing
is in danger and it is absurd to suppose
that they will pretend to attempt to sur
round or enter Havana, when, until the
present moment, they have not dared to
enter any town of medium importance.
"In the Department of ihe East, in the
principal villas and even in Matanzaa,
nothing of importance has occurred, not
withstanding a large number of troops
have been withdrawn from there. That
shows that the insurgents have no means
and are not supported by the population."
NEW YORK, N. Y.^.Tan. 7. -The Re
corder will say to-morrow: Senor Sidel
Pierra, a Cuban merchant of this city, who
has been in communication with friends
among the insurgents, scoffed yesterday at
the statement that General Gomez did not
intend to make an attack on Havana.
Senor Pierra declares positively that the
insurgent general will make the attack and
take the city.
It is not Gomez' intention to remain in
Havana any longer than it will take to
ransack it for arms, ammunition and sup
plies and recruit his forces from sympa
thizers who are kept under cover hv the
presence of the Spanish soldiers. Gomez
is now within thirteen miles of Havana,
and one of his first moves will be to cut off
the city's water supply.
Senor Pierra made the rather startling
declaration that Gomez could take Havana
with 2000 men, and in support of this state
ment he said that the Spanish volunteers
were so thoroughly dissatisfied with
General Campos that they were ready to
do anything to aid the insurgents. It is
said that they intend to make certain de
mands upon Campos as a pretext, which,
they know he will refuse, and then will
give a signal to Gomez to make the attark,
when the volunteers will promptly desert
to the insurgent ranks.
There are 35,000 citizens in Havana old
enough to fight and the majority of these
are in sympathy with Gomez and only
await deliverance from the presence of the
Spanish soldiers to throw their support in
aid of the revolution.
Gomez, Senor Pierra declares, will go
into Havana with 2000 men. but will leave
it with a force of at least 30,000.
PREI'AKEIt IS JiOSTOy.
Misleading Report* as to the "Capture"
of Havana.
NEW YORK, X. V., Jan. 7.â The Chi
cago Associated Press last evening circu
ited a report that Havana had been
captured by the Cuban insiir.
Strangely enough, this startling announce
ment did not come direct from Havana, as
it naturally and very promptly would if
the insurgents were really in possession of
the Cuban capital, but it was projected
upon the puhlic in Boston, obviously the
headquarters of the "representative of the
Chicago Associated Press in Havana." As
might have been supposed, this wholly
unfounded and inexcusable report found
its way to Havana, and its receipt imme
diately provoked an emphatic though en
tirely unnecessary denial.
Through the miKiiuru of a United Press
dispatcii cabled from Havana, not Boston,
the reading public of the United States
were informed that the city was in a per
fectly tranquil state, and that not the
slightest apprehension was /eit by the in
habitants or oflicials in regard to its im
munity from investment or capture by the
insurgents. AVhen Havana is taken by
the insurgents, if ever it should be, an
nouncement of the event will not be cabled
from Boston, but from Havana, and that
too as quickly as its captors can send out
to the world the news of their victory.
This alleged Havana dispatcii, via Ba
tabano and Boston. has= the flavor of ranch
of the matter contained in the palpably
false and plainly home manufactured
"dispatches" which the Chicago Asso
ciated Press are accustornedto send out
daily.
A few weeks ago one purported to come2
from Constantinople, via Sofia, Bulgaria,
and it may bt>, indeed it is liKely, that it is
the work of the same "representative,"
though it seems strange that the Havana
and Constantinople representatives of the
Chicago Associated Press should be located
in Boston. One would fancy that such an
arrangement might be confusing, leading
to t: c capture ot Havana in Asia Minor,
or the slaughter of the Armenians by the
Kurds of Santiago de Cuba and the Bashi-
Bazouks of Santa Clara. Clearly the opera
tion of such a system must involve much
greater care in the dating of "dispatches"
than in their manufacture.

the war ure being felt in thi3 province.
The Mayor of Corral Falso has telegraphed
to the Governor of this province report
ing large number of persons asking for
food and protection in th.-dr misery.
The Mayor reported that in that town
food was getting very scarce owing to the
cessation of all communication. Sencrs
Diaz y l'oyos of the Atrevido BUgar estate,
near Macurriees, reports that nearly
1000 people have sought safety by moving
on their property; that they were wholly
without food of any kind except what the
estate had furnished them. Their anxiety
and misery bad been added to by their
being surrounded by bands of rebels.
When the messenger left with this in
formation an attack was expected.
A mass-meeting of the merchants of this
city baa just Deen held, at which the whole
situation w.is discussed, including the
awful position of the inhabitants of the
many towns in the interior of this
province. A spot subscription was made
and instant relief will be sent to the in

necessary articles to prevent starvation.
In that section the rebels are destroying

PROBABLY LOST AT SEA
It Is Feared That the Wild
Flower Foundered During
a Terrific Gale.
The Steamer Left Philadelphia for
Rouen With a Cargo of Oil and
a Crew of Thirty.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Jan. 7. -During
the terrible gale which swept the Atlantic
in the middle of December it is believed
that the British steamship Wild Flower,
which sailed for Rouen, France, on De
cember 11, with, a crew of thirty men,
foundered in mid-ocean. There has been
anxiety for her safety for some time and
she was posted in Lloyds' shipping-rooms
in London to-day as a missing vessel.
Captain Frederick Stanwell of Wiesbeck,
Eng., commanded her.
The Wild Flower wal a bulk oil-carrier
of large dimensions and was one of the
Fox line of oil-carriers. Her cargo was
valued at $i9,(>53 and fully insured in for
eign companies.
The missing vessel was owned by Alfred
Stuart & Co. of London, lar^e holders of
s'.<;<m craft engaged in carrying oil in
bulk.

TELEGRAMS TO ENGLAND
Lodge Said the Statute Made This
Procedure Clearly a Crim
inal Act.
VEST DEFENDED DEMOCRACY.
Protested Against the Strictures Con
tained in Sherman's Recent
Speech.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 7.-The
Finance Committee substitute for the
House bond bill was reported in the Senate
to-day by Jones (D.) of Arkansas, and was
placed on the calendar, Jones giving no
tice that he would ask the Senate to take
it up for consideration to-morrow, and
expressing the desire that it be disposed of
at the earliest possible day.
It was stated by Morrill (R.) of Ver
mont, chairman of the Finance Commit
tee, that the substitute had the approval
of the majority of the committee, but not
of the .Republican members of it.
A plan for making the proposed loan a
really popular one was suggested by
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire in the
shape of a bill containing most of the
features of a postal-saving system. Chand
ler explained it at some length and spoke
on it in a somewhat jocose vein of humor
as a complete and perfect panacea for the
existing financial trouble. He had it re
ferred to the Postuffice Committee, but
said that he would offer it as an amend
ment to tLe bill of the Finance Com
mittee.
In connection with it there was a rather
interesting discuss?on in relation to the
cable correspondence of Mr. Pulitzer with
the Prince of Wales, the Rothschilds and
other public characters in Englandâ the
statute making such correspondence a
criminal act being brought to the atten
tion of the Senate dv Lodge (R.) of Massa
chusetts.
Later on in the day Vest (D.) of Missouri
took the floor and in a speech occupying
over two hours, delivered with great earn
estness and vehemence, defending the
Democratic party and the Cleveland ad
ministration from the strictures contained
in Sherman's recent speech, particularly
in connection with tariff legislation. As
to the finance question he declared him
self an uncompromising adherent of the
free coinage of silver, and spoke of that
question as an irrepressible conflict which
could not be evaded and which had to be
fought to a tinish.
At 4:50 the Senate adjourned until to
morrow.
Lindsay (D.) of Kentucky took the oath
of office for his new term.
In presenting a petition from the Com
mon Council of Worcester, Mass., in favor
of the Armenian, Hoar (R.) of Massa
chusetts inquired whether the Committee
on Foreign Relations had taken any action
on the numerous petitions referred to it of
the same character. He was informed by
Harmon (R.) of Ohio, its chairman, that
the Committee on Foreign Relations was
animated by a most earnest desire to re
lieve the Armenians, if possible; but had
not yet taken the subject into considera
tion. The committee had only recently
been appointed, and the matter had not
yet been reached. Jones (D.) of Arkansas
reported from the Committee on Finance
the House bond bill with a substitute, and
f,'ave notice that to-morrow immediately
after the morning business he would ask
the Senate to take it up for consideration.
At the request of Eikins (R.) of West
Virginia, his resolution requiring United
States bonds to be issued after public ad
vertisement was referred to the Finance
Committee.
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire intro
duced a popular loan bill and proceeded to
explain it. He read the first paragranh of
his bill, which provides for postal savings
notes to bear interest for five years and to
be repaid in the sort of money deposited,
whether gold, silver or paper. He said
that he did not regard the recent treasury
notice, announcing a popular loan, as be
ing in satisfactory form. He was erateful
to the -Secretary for heeding the voice of
the people as offered in. the Senate the
other day, of the Senator from Nebraska
(Allen) and other tribunes of the people
(laughter), but he did not regard it as a
wise method of testing the willingness of
the people to supply money to the Gov
ernment.
Chandler's bill provides for the issue of
postal savings notes of the lace value of
$100, with interest thereon at the rate of
$3 a year, with a tofal interest of $16 if the
notes are not presented at the expiration
of five years. After five years, in addition
to the sum of $16, the Government is to
pay $4 for each, year's interest. These
notes may be issued in sums of $50 and are
redeemable at the pleasure of the Govern
ment after five years. He elaborated the
provisions of the bill and had it referred to
the Postoffice Committee, but gave notice
that he would offer it as an amendment to
the bill reported to-day from the Finance
Committee.
Lodge, referring to Chandler's statement
83 to the Rothschilds dispatch, read a
statute making it illegal for citizens of the
United States to correspond with foreign
Governments or officials in regard to the
public measures in the United States, and
he asked Chandler whether he did not
think that the telegrams from the New
York World were not an illegal interfer
ence and an attempt to throw doubt on
the credit of the Government.
Chandler agreed with Lodge in these
views. Tbe law certainly applied to the
Pulitzer telegram to the Prince of Wales,
the heir apparent to the throne, on a pub
lic question which made the relations be
tween the two countries acute. And he
declared that if the President and the
Attorne3'-General did their duty Mr. Pu
litzer, if he ever set foot upon American
soil, which he occasionally did, would be
prosecuted according to law.
The resolution offered by Sherman (R.)
of Ohio on December 31, declaring that the
use of the gold reserve to supply deficien
cies is of doubtful legality and greatly in
iurious to the public credit, and that a
sum of not less than $100,000,000 in gold
coin or bullion should be restored to the
treasury and segregated from all other
funds, was taken up, and Vest (D.) of Mis
souri addressed the Senate upon it. He
repudiated the idea that the Democratic

party was dead, and declared that when it
did die the last hope of popular government
would have disappeared. If the income tax
in the Wilson bill had been collected,
there would have been no deficiency of
revenue. He reviewed the decision of the
Supreme Court of the United States which
declared that tax unconstitutional, and
asserted that no decision had ever been
rendered by that court which had done so
much to destroy its influence and to excite
distrust among the masses of the Ameri
can people, including intelligent and
thoughtful lawyers. For a hundred years,
he said, no lawyer had doubted that Con-
gress had the rurht to tax the income of
real and personal property without appor
tionment according to population among
the States. He did not propose to analyzo
the decision of the Supreme Court declar
ing the income tax unconstitutional, nor
should he trust himself to enter into the
conjecture as to the reasons which caused
one member of that court, after agreeing
deliberately as to the constitutionality of
the largest portion of the law, to reverse
his opinion two weeks afterward on a re
hearing. The name of that Justice was
unknown. It was known alone to himself
and his official associates.
Vest then went on to reply to Sherman's
speech in criticism of the Democratic ad
ministration, and he pointed to the fact
that during the four years of Mr. Cleve
land's first term the export of gold was
only $79,000,000, while in the next four
years of Mr. Harrison's administration
the export of gold was $213,000,000.
Coming to the question of the free coin
age of silver, Vest declared that the Re
publican party was as hopelessly divided
on tnat question as the Democratic party
was, and the struggle of Republican Seu-
ators was to evade that issue if possiole
and not to permit the general public to as
certain that they were as hopelessly di
vided on it as he claimedâ and as he
conceded the Democrats were.
'â¢All the people of this country," Vest
exclaimed, "are engaged in an irrepres
sible conflictâ as irrepressible as that
which marched the armies of the North
and South in the Civil War. I trust that
the settlement will not be by violence. I
hope and believe that it will not be. But
the conflict is just as irrepressible, and
must be fought out to the last extremity.
All attempts to evade the issue are impos
sible. The sooner it is settled the better
for the tranquillity of the country and the
better for the public and private life of
the land."
PROCEEDINGS XA THE HOUSE.
Breezy Debate Over the Special Employes
liecommended.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 7.-In the
House a unanimous report from the Com
mittee on Judiciary was made by Brod
erick (R.) of Kansas that no doubt ex
isted of the election of Allen as a repre
sentative from Utah, and in accordance
therewith Allen was sworn in as a mem
ber of the House.
Henderson (R.) of lowa reported from
the Committee on Judiciary its unani
mous substitute for a resolution introduced
by Representative Hubbard regarding the
enforcement of the anti-trust law. The
original resolution assumed that the At
torney-General had failed to carry out the
law, and the substitute calls upon the At
torney-General for information as to the
steps he has taken in that direction and
what further legislation is needed to pro
tect the people against trade trusts and
conspiracies. The substitute was agreed to.
The House then, at 1:25 p. m., adjourned
until to-morroyv, when the rules will be
reported.
There was a breezy debate over the ap
pointment of special employes, recom
mended by the Committee on Accounts.
The report submitted by Aldrich (R.) of
Illinois, chairman, provides for the ap
pointment of two new employes in the
doorkeeper's division, one of whom had
been discharged after a service of nearly a
score of years.
Johnson (R.) of Indiana and Walker
(R.) of Massachusetts denounced the dis
charge of this employe, which the former
said had been mafle necessary by reasons
of the demands of the "combine," which
organized the House for places for constit
uents, an illustration, he said, of the dis
creditable proceedings of such affairs.
Walker went further, saying the recom
mendation of the committee was requested
to repair the damage to the public service
by the combine. He also asked whether
or not the reading clerks who could not
be heard on either side of the house were
to be retained throughout the Congress,
not by the will of the Speaker ,por of the
House, but of the gentlemen "who farm
out the offices."
The report of the committee was adopted
â150 to 10.
MAY PASS THE BILL
The House Tariff Measure
to Be Reported With
out Changes.
CONSIDERED IN CAUCUS.
If One Amendment Is Made
There Will Be Many
Others Offered.
INTEBESTS OF VARIOUS STATES.
Jones of the Finance Committee Appears
to Be the Present Master of
the Situation.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 7.â Owing
to the late session of the Senate the Re
publican caucus, that took a recess until
this afternoon, was postponed until to
morrow after the adjournment of the
Senate. It is confidently believed that at
that conference the Republicans will, by a
vote of a comfortable majority, direct their
members on the Finance Committee to re
port the tariff bill to the Senate as it came
from the House, and without amendments
of any Kind.
Shortly after the caucus convened this
morning Quay moved that the committee
be so instructed, and his motion led to the
debate that followed. But one Senator in
dicated any desire to reconstruct, a tariff
bill along Republican lines. That Senator
was Baker of Kansas, a new man, and his
associates in the Senate looked upon his
zeal as the result of his unfamiliarity with
the conditions that surround the Senate at
this time. There were other speakers who
desired amendments to be made, and said
they would insist upon them if the debate
was opened at all ; but, if the consensus of
opinion was that this should be done, they
would be satisfied and support the majority.
There is a division in the Finance Com
mittee itself as to the wisdom of amend
ing the House bill, and it was because of
such division that this caucus was held.
Sherman favored an additional rate on
crockery, if changes were to be made, and
Platt's State was largely interested in the
raising of tobacco, and if amendments
were in order he was constrained to look
after that schedule. Allison's constitu
ents were largely interested in agricul
tural products, and he, too, would be com
pelled to insist on an increase there.
On the other hand, Jones, the Potralist
member, urged that raw sugar had been
discriminated against when the House re
fused to increase it by 15 per cent, as it
had every other schedule on the bill.
Jones insisted with vigorous protestations
that raw sugar should be given this addi
tional 15 per cent in the Senate. He was
re-enforced in this contention by Perkins
of California and Thurston of Nebraska,
both of whom reDresent States that are
engaged in the growing of beets for sugaT
and the manufacture of sugar from that
farm product. Thurston was not in a
position to urge the committee, but he has
done so very effectually by the aid of the
telegraph.
In view of these contentions it is easy to
see that the Republicans of the committee
were very much at sea as to what should
be the policy they ought to pursue.
Hence their appeal to the full membership
of their own party. Should the caucus to
morrow, as seems likely, instruct the com
mittee to report the bill thus reported,
and vote down any and all amendments,
a deadlock between Jones and the Repub
lican members of the committee appears
to be imminent. Jones holds the balance
of power in the committee. His vote is
necessary to report the bill, and without
him the Republicans cannot report the
measure in any shape.
Jones said to-night that he would in9ist
upon the addition of the 15 per cent to the
sugar schedule. If the caucus so decides
the Republican members will not grant it.
Jones, it seems, must then either change
his mind or the bill will remain on the
files of the Committee on Finance.
Republicans profess to believe that Mr.
Jones will not put himself on record, but
that after urging his proposition he will
yield to the will of his former Republican
associates, and permit the bill to be re
ported. It looks to-night as if Jones was
master of the situation.

TO PROTECT THE POOR
Bowers Argues the Bill for a
Postal Savings
Bank.
Denounces Men of Money Who Have
Grabbed Up the Earnings
of Labor.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 7.-Mr.
Lord, chairman on Postoffices and Post
roads, organized his committee to-day,
and I3ower3 of California appeared before
it to advocate his postal savings bank bill.
He argued that the main purpose of the
bill was to provide a place where "com
mon people," the wageworkers, could de
posit such of their small earnings and
savings as they could spare and be sure of
recovering them when wanted. He said
that nineteen-twentieths of the people of
the United States were wageworkers and
producers who created all the wealth.
The one-twentieth consisted of commis
sion men, generally erroneously called
business men, who produced nothing, but
lived and often grew rich by appropriating
either legally or illegally, honestly or dis
honestly, small earnings and Bavings of
common people.
From every part of the country comes
the demand for the postal savings system.
It is only opposed by commission men â
the so-called business men â bankers and
speculators, whose business it is to absorb
these small savings and earnings without
giving value received.
'â¢We hear much about the business in
ests of the country and what business men
(in plain English, the commission men)
demand in every measure that comes be
fore Congress, and from my observations
nineteen-twentieths of legislation by Con
gress is in the interest of commission men
and only one-twentieth for the common
people."
He referred to the numberless failures of
savings banks and deliberate stealing of
aaving3 of wage-earners by so-called sav
ings banks connected with National banks,
which, in most cases, were mere slop
buckets or waste-baskets into which Na
tional banks dumped their waste papers.
He alluded to the "rotten savings banks
at San Diego, through which hundreds of
laborers, men and women, lost all their
savings, yet men who took their money, in
many cases their all, and deliberated
robbed them, go unpunished and are ih
comfortable circumstances." It is to pro
tect paople from such robbery that some
such a measure as this should be adopted.
Bowers' bill wus referred to a sub-com
mittee and the Postoffice Department will
be asked to report upon it.

TO REFORM THE LAWS
Senator Perkins Proposes to
Encourage Settlers in
Alaska.
PROVISIONS OF HIS BILL.
The Irregularity in the Way of
Securing Land Patents to
Be Obviated.
INDUSTRIES TO BE DEVELOPED.
Cattle-Growing Expected to Become a
Great Feature of the Northern
Land.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 7.â A bill
introduced by Senator Perkins to-day is
calculated to completely reform the land
laws of Alaska. The Senator in explana
tion of his bill said to a Call corre
spondent:
"It will enable firms and individuals,
who have landed interests in Alaska, to
secure patents from the Government on
claims to land winch have been taken up
in such places and in such forms as best
suited the purposes of their business, but
to which there has bten a difficulty in se
curing title. The provisions of the present
law also render it very hard, and in some
cases practically impossible, to secure the
evidence necessary to secure a title. My
bill provides that a claim shall include all
improvement, made by the claimant, pro
vided that not more than ltjO acres are in
cluded. The land in question may be,
and often is, very irrecular in shape on ac
count of these improvements, which were
made according to exigencies of the busi
ness transacted.
"This irregularity has hitherto stood in
the way of securing patents from the
Government, but it is recognized and
allowed by the new bill. Canneries and
other enterprises are particularly affected,
as it has been necessary to place their
buildings wherever they were needed,
without reference to the sauare form of
the Government survey.
"The present law compels claimants and
their witnesses to visit Sitka in* order to
make finaJ proof. This has been a very
great hardship, for claimants and wit
nesses are at Portland, San Francisco and
other points in California, and even in the
East. A journey to the neighborhood of
the north pole is, therefore, a hardship,
and has materially interfered with secur
ing patents to Alaska lands. The bill pro
vides that testimony may be taken
wherever and when witnesses may be
conveniently found, but it is provided that
land officers anywhere may take and re
ceive testimony. The measure, moreover,
confirms all entries already made on
depositions taken outside of Alaska.
'â¢Deputy surveyors are given authority
to make surveys whenever on the ground,
and are requested to do so without com
municating with the office at Sitka or re
ceiving special instructions. They are also
empowered to do all work pending in the
locality. It is provided that depositions
shall be received if made at any time be
fore the deputy returns his survey. These
depositions may be applied to the pur
chase price and certificates of deposit
made transferable.
"A part of Alaska is well adapted to
stock purposes, provided sufficient acreage
is allowed. The ordinary agricultural
pursuits may not be profitable, but ani
mal raising may succeed. The bill en
courages the experiment. The district is
now practically a waste. If it can be util
ized by somo industry for profit to invest
ors, shipping or revenue, it is given se
curity by right to title.
"The islands are natural stock ranges,
and special privileges are given to persons
who will stock them with an adaptable
source of income. The coast westward of
Yahutat Bay is a succession of islands.
They should be devoted to some useful
purpose. It may be available to devote
them to animal raising, and encourage
ment is extended to the venturesome in
vestors.
"Alaska contains large areas of coal
lands. There is no law for acquisition of
title to them, and in the absence of some
law for their sale private capital is slow in
developing them. There is no special coal

A. Xrtc Machine Oun for the Use of
Xaval Slii/is.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 7.â A Tribune
special from Washington says: A new
machine gun has been adopted for the use
on naval ships which the small arms board
reports to be the most destructive weapon
firing a bullet of its caliber yet found.
The gun has a record of 420 shot 3 a min
ute and requires no work except the pres
sure of an electric button to maintain the
terrific tir e f the automatic system having
been applied to it.
The gun is a self-feeder and grinds out
shots with the rapidity that would make
it a most dangerous place for landing par
ties. As compared to the Galling, which
has been the naval machine gun for years,
it is just about as superior as the modern
rifled gun is to the old smoothbore.
The Gatling has a weight of 350 pounds,
while the new gun weighs only thirty-five
pounds, and can be taken by a man on his
shoulder and easily carried from point to

The Potter Removal Case
May Be Reopened at
Once.
NEW EVIDENCE FOUND.
Miller & Lux Check Given to
a San Francisco Woman
by the Executor.
SHE REFUTES HIS TESTIMONY.
He Had Sworn That a Ranch Employe
Received and Cashed the
Draft.
REDWOon CITY, Cat.., Jan. 7.-The
BUil for the removal of Jesse Sheldon Pot
i executor of the Charles Lux estate
â was closed al>out a month ago, and since
that time the decision of Superior Judge
Buck ha 3 been looked forward to with con
siderable interest. There were many spec
ulations as to just when the ruling might
be expected, although from the very be
ginning Judge Back has held that he
would be in no hurry about it. It now
transpires that the case may be reopened
if circumstance? demand such a course.
A fen- days ago, on application of I>. M.
Delmas and 1. H. Cam7.be 1 !. attorneys for
petitioners in the suit to remove Potter,
Buck permitted depositions to be
taken in Ban Fran cisco collaterally and
simultaneously with the depositions taken
in the case of Miranda W. Lux, deceased.
It is said that E. S. PiJlsbury, of counsel
tter, came to R Iwood City the next
day and labored long and earnestly with
Judge Buck to induce him to recall his
permission to take ;â  stimony in San Fran
cisco, urging that the case had been duly
closed and 1 should not be reopened. But
Judge Buck was proof against Attorney
ary's eloquence, and the taking of
deposil "ded.
Yesterday County Clerk J. F. Johnston

fa believed that, this testimony is a
Eerious blow to Potter's chances for a
favorable decision in the removal suit.
For two or three days there has been a
noticeable flitting to and fro of the vari
ous parties interested in the outcome of
the litigation, and there is a vague whis
pering in Potter-Lux-Miller circles that
the speedy resignation of Jesse Potter is
the most piobable solution of the whole

THE WINE FLOWED.
Stories of Jesse Potter's Revelry
Told by Mrs. Sadie Young
In Affidavits.
When the Lux <fc Miller case is re
opened Mrs. Sadie Young will be the cen
tral figure in it. She and others have
isworn to affidavits and produced account
books to show that early in 1803 Jesse
. the son of Mrs. Lux, deceased,
spent big sums of monpy with her for
trine and lived very rapidly.
MrÂ«. Young i<= the proprietress of a
house at 317 Stockton street, of whose
ition there can be jio doubt. At the
time Mr. Potter was such a valuable cus
tbmer to her she was living with other
women at 205 Post street.
There will be other affidavits. They are
merely of value in corroborating Mrs.
Young's story. All of them are upon that
one particular question.
According to Mrs. Young, Mr. Potter
called "f;en at her house. Sometimes he
came aione. but oft?ner with friends. He
was alv.ays lavish in his expenditures and
wine invariably flowed even faster than
water. And though Mrs. Young does not
pay whether she had a license to sell liquor
ornot he invariably made a little memo
randum of the number of bottles used.
Thes^e memoranda made ut> a part of a
set of very simple books. When the ac
counts amounted to several hundred dol
lars she would make out a little bill and
get her money. Mr. Potter's last little bill
amounted to $800.
lie paid this graciously enough. The
check lie gpve her was for $800. It was
made payable to bear?r and was honored
upon presentation. This was early in
1593.
Nothing more was said of this till about a
month aj;o. Then, she says,three detectives,
one of whom was Ross Whittaker, went to
her house and questioned her. They learned
about the amount of wine Mr. Potter had
paid for and she had then been called on
.to testify.
Mrs. M. Howarth, the housekeeper for
Mrs. Sadie Young, swore to Mr. Potter's
frequent daita to the house and his winÂ«
buying propensities. She had taken the
check for $SOO around the corner to Ed
Marcband, the restaurateur. Mr. Mar
cband cashed it and gave her the money,
which she took to her residence.
Mr. Marchand made affidavit to cashing
thecfa ck. The paving-teller of the bank
made affidavit to having received it. The
jheck itsel! is in evidence, so there csÂ»n be
t... doubt as to Mr. Potter having incurred
fca indebtedness to Mrs. Young and set
tling it.
There can be but one purpose in prepar
ing this mass of aliidavits. It would be to
kfaow that Mr. Potter was careless of
money, prodigal in his expenditures and a
companion of dissolute women. There has
been no indication a;> to how Mr. Potter's
attorneys will meet these charges in order
to prevent his being deposed from his posi
tion.

FASADiWA'S JIOMASCE.
Crimea Confessed by n young Man Re
cently Converted.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Jan. 7.-The
members of the South Pasadena Baptist
Church, who had assembled at a prayer
meeting last evening, were astonished
when a young man, who had recently ex
perienced religion and who vas a general
favorite in the church, arose and stated
that he hud a startling confession to make.
The young man had appeared in Pasa
dena about two months ago, giving his
name as Charles Crawford. He secured
employment in a store, ana became an at
tendant and then a convert in the First
Baptist Church.
h\ beginning his confession, the convert
said thai his true name was Albert Diffen
derfer, and this parents lived at Lan
caster, Pa.
"In April, 1894." said he. "I was sen
tenced to the Reform School at Hunting
ton, Pa., for a period of four years. I was
convicted on three different charges of
grand iarceny, and there is now banging
over my head another charge of forcible
entry, which means burglary in this State.
'After being in the reformatory for one
year I was paroled on account of my good
behavior and influence brought lo bear by
my fattier, who is a merchant in Lancas
ter. I was obliged to report only at cer-

"I wanted to lead a better life and
wanted to get away from the scenes of my
crimes and so resolved to run away, which
I did, thereby forfeiting my parole, and I
have now three years to serve besides the
charge of forcible entry."'
The youns; man arrived at the Sheriff's
ofiici' early this morning in company with
Mr. Mciteynolds. The story was related to
Sheriff Burr, and he at once telegraphed to
Huntingion in regard to the matter.
FLAGSTAFF'S WAR SCARE
Startling Rumors of a Navajo
Uprising Prove to Have Been
Exaggerated.
The Posse Sent to Rescue Settlers
Fails to Find Evidence of Se-
rious Trouble.
ALBUQUERQUE, N. M., Jan. 7.-The
startling rumor last night of an uprising
of the Navajo Indians proves to have been
exaggerated. A cowboy had ridden into
Flagstaff at a breakneck speed and an
nounced that a band of twenty-five rene
gade Navajos had a number of white
settlers surrounded at a place about forty
miles distant and that relief must be sent
immediately. The Sheriff of the county,
with a strc ng posse, left for the scene of
the trouble at once, but a messenger who
came in from the part}' to-day reports
that the difficulty was but a slight one.
While there is some trouble between a few
of the Indians and the white settlers in
the immediate vicinity of the reservation
in regard to the right of the Indians to
graze their sheep on the public lands, there
is no general uprising of the Navajos or a
threat of one.
The Navajos number about 25.000, and if
they should go to war with the whites
they would cause serious trouble, for they
are all well armed. Roving banns occa
sionally commit depredations upon iso
lated settlers, as in this case, but the
Indians have too much property at stake
to co upon [,ip tvarpatb as a tribe.
It has been learned that a small band of
Nnvajor, captured three cowboys who dis
puted the grazing right of the Indians.
They were probably released before the
Flagstaff posse arrived.

MADERA, CAU, Jan. 7.â The case of
Kutner & Huffman against Henry Miller
came up in the Superior Court here to-ciay
on a motion by the defendant to dissolve
the injunction. The ground upon which
Miller relied in suppor. of his motion is
that the injunction was irregularly issued,
inasmuch as where there was nogreat or
irreparable damage threatened a suit for
trespass and damage was the proper ac
tion. The matter was taken under advise

GUESTS OF TRUCKEE
Nevada's Contingent Comes
on a Special Train
From Reno.
TRIP TO DONNER LAKE.
Visitors Treated to a Sleigh Ride
and a Tournament on
the Ice.
PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.
Success of the Carnival Leads to a
Scheme for a Permanent
Winter Resort.
TRUCKEE, Cat-., Jan. 7.â An excursion
train from Reno brought 150 carnival vis-
itors to-day, and the town has been given
up to the Nevada people. The Truckee
brass band met the excursionists at the
depot and led the way through the ice
palace, then giving a concert at the top
of tiie tobogrian-slide, while the guests
crowded on the Canadian sleds for the trip
through space.
After noon a sleighing party was made
up, and all the. Reno people were taken to
Douner Lake and the big ice pond, where
there is a skating surface of twenty-five
acres. Then there was more skating on
the ponds in town and at the ice palace,
for the residents of Reno are expert on the
steel runners.
The evening was devoted to the usual
sports of the carnival, and there were a
few social events about town. Another
excursion is expected from the eastward
on Friday, and it is understood here that
a big party will come from Sacramento on
Sunday, when a round trip rate of about
$5 will be offered at the capital city.
The weather here has been rather mild
for an ice carnival during the past two
days, and a heavy snowstorm is predicted
by local weather prophets.
There was some excitement in the town j
to-night over the news that six of the men |
employed in cutting ice at the Truckeo |
meadows had been poisoned. These em
ployes were at the big boarding-house on !
the lake, and it is supposed that the '
poison was contained in canned food. ']
Some of the men were seriously ill, and
when the symptoms were discovered there i
was not a physician within three miles of 1
the place, but it is expected that none of

the cases will be fatal. This is the only '
unusual incident that has occurred during
the carnival.
Following The Call's suggestion, the j
carnival managers have fenced off the |
level portion of the toboggan way from ]
the route of the coasters. The double-rip- '
pers now have to make a sharp turn or go i
through the fence, and that makes the
sport ail the better for the boys.
Two large sleighing parties came in
from Prosser Creek this evening. It is
estimated that there are from 400 to 500 j
carnival guests here, and the residents are j
jubilant over this early indication of the |
success of the enterprise.
There is iittle doubt that before the end '
of the month all the visitors that the town )
can accommodate will be here. In view \
of the popularity of the winter sport and
the assurance that these carnivals will be
annual features, there is already talk of
greatly enlarging the hotel facilities, and
it is not improbable that a new hotel will
be built in this vicinity especially for a
winter resort. An endeavor will be made
to have the railroad company grant stop
over privileges on all classes of tickets
durinc the carnival time next year.
"The carnival is certainly goin^ to be a
success," said Charles P. McGlashan of
the carnival committee to-day. "It is a
success already. This is the first year of
the enterprise, and of course, it is not easy
to get people started toward a new lield of
amusement. But the people of Truckee
are satisfied with the undertaking. The
directors do not expect that Eastern tour-
j ists will come here in any great numbers,
â  except that those who travel this way may
, stop over for a few hours.
"The main patronage is expected from
the people of California and Nevada. To
the Easterners an ice carnival is not the
greatest attraction.
"It. is argued that the trip over the sum
mit of the Sierras and the sport here avail
able ought to be experienced by every Cali
fornia, and that the health benefits to be
derived from the athletic exercises in the
cold and rarefied air will be a great factor
in establishing the popularity of the car
nivals."
SANTA BARBARA'S FETE.
State Firemen to Be Honored Guests at
the Coming Carnival of
Roses.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Jan. 7.â The
Flower Festival Association is arranging
Its programme for the forthcoming spring
festival, to be held on April 13, 14, 15 and
16, and a succession of charming and
brilliant spectacles is promised, far ex
ceeding both in scope and attraction those
of any previous festival here.
A.n important feauture to be incorporated
with the great fete this year will be the
tournament of the Southern California
Association of Volunteer Firemen, which
has selected Santa Barbara for its place of
meeting this year, because of this city's
great liberality in the matter of prizes.
This tournament, lasting four days, will
be coincident with the flower festival, and
will be given prominence in connection
with it, the free use of the tribunes being
conceded the visiting association on all
but, the floral procession day.
The firemen's programme is made out,
and will consist of running contests for
hose companies; department horserace;
a wet run, embracing runs to hydrants,
connection of and operation of hose, hose
disconnections, transfers of hose and of
hose sections; connection with pipe and
sacond operation of hos. There will also
be hook ana ladder contest, single ladder
contest, coupling contests and hub-and
hub races, concluding with a ceneral field
day of athletic sports on Saturday, the
closing day.
No professional fireman will be permitted
to compete, and, as these volunteers are a
splendid body of men, numbering some of
the finest athletes in the State, the tourna
ment promises to be a notable one.
The local volunteer corps, to whose
enterprise and intercession the city is
largely indebted for the arrangement
which has secured this meet, has on their
own part extended an invitation to the
Exempt San Francisco firemen, the vet
eran organization of the State, to attend
the carnival as its honored guests.
CL 0 VERDALE'S FAIR.
Dates for the Annual Exhibit of Citrus Fruits
and Wines Announced by iha
Directors.
CLOVERDALE, Cal., Jan. 7.â The
Cloverdale Citrus Fair Association will
hold its fourth annual exhibition at Hum
bert's Pavilion on January 29, 30 and 31.
This was decided at a meeting of the board
of directors â John Field (president), W.
T. Brush, M. Menihan, George B. Baer, F.
W. Brush and C. E. Humbert â last night.
The citrus fair this year will be more
than a local affair. The whole of Sonoma
County is taking a lively interest in it al
ready and displays by the several towns in
the county will form interesting features
of the exhibition. Among the displays
will be Sonoma County wines, famous all
over the world. Of course everything will
be subordinate to the citrus fruit displays,
which will this year equal anything of the
kind seen at the Midwinter Fair.
Fear is entertained that the pavilion will
not be large enough to hold all the dis
plays; stili those that it will contain will
be worth coming miles to see.
The orange crop this year around Clover
dale is thrice that of last year, and the
fruit is large in size and luscious in taste.
Tiees are loaded to the ground with both
oranges and lemons.

SAN RAFAEL ROMANCE
Miss Ellen Gable Brings
Suit Against Her
Fiance.
ACCUSATIONS OF FRAUD.
The Time- Worn Tale of Faith
less Suitor and Trusting
Maid Retold.
HE SECURED ALL HER MONEY.
Forgot His Promise to Marry After
She Had No More Gold
to Give.
SAN RAFAEL, Cat,., Jan. 7.â A de
cidedly interesting and what promises to
be a highly sensational suit has been filed
with the County Clerk of Marin County,
in which Miss Ellen Gable, living in the
northern part of the county, is plaintiff,
and Hugh McCormick and E. R. Samu^ Is
are named as defendants. Miss Gable ac
cuses Hugh McCormick, assisted by E. R.
Samuels, of defrauding her out of over
$2000. In the complaint she sets forth the
oit- repeated tale of the faithless suitor and
a trusting maiden. The parties to the ac
tion are well known in the northern part
of the county, where they reside.
Some time ago Ellen Gable bestowed her
affections upon Hugh McCormick, who
was apparently a hard-working sort of
fellow, and he in turn appeared to love the
fair Ellen. After they had been keening
company for some time he promised to
marry her, but said at the time that he
was hardly prepared to do so from a finan
cial standpoint and represented to Miss
Gable that he needed at least $2000 to fix
up his farm and build a house in which
they could live together as man and wife.
Miss Gable possessed some means and,
trusting him implicitly, readily advanced
the money he needed. In all, so she sets
forth in her complaint, she advanced $2100,
believing that he would marry her. All
this occurred in 1804, and he lias not mar
ried Miss Gable and refuses to give up the
$2100.
The plaintiff further alleges that De
fendant E. It. Samuels, whom she has
made a party to the case, has colluded with
McCormick in order to defraud her out of
the money she advanced to McCormick.
She charges that on October 15, 1895, Mc-
Cormick, without any consideration, exe
cuted and delivered to Samuels a mortgage
on his property to secure a promissory
note executed by him to Samuels on the
same day for the sum of $2100, with in
terest at 8 per cent. This was done, she
declares, to defraud her, and she wants
relief from the court.
Miss Gable is determined to fight the
case to the bitter end, as she considers
that McCormick has treated her in an
outrageous manner.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Jan.
7. â Students are busy now getting ready
for a long semester's work. With but one
week's recess at Easter, there will be no
further break in university instruction for
nearly five months, when the iong sum

The postponement of the Stanford suit
was a disappointment to the students,
all of whom have the university's inter

Freight Cars Ititched by the Breaking of
It! I .-).> If.
SEATTLE. Wash., Jan. 7.â A Northern
Pacific coal train, heavily laden, from Car
bonado to Tacoma, was wrecked this after
noon in a big cut about half way between
Puyallup and the Indian Reservation
bridge.
No loss of life resulted, though thÂ«
engine and fifteen or twenty cars were
ditched, being piled three and four deep
in places. The rails were torn up, some of
them being bent and twisted into every
imaginable shape.
Local trains between Seattle and Tacoma
have been abandoned, though the North
ern Pacific officials say th*y expect to get
the wreck sufficiently cleared and the
tracks relaid in time for the regular Port
lr"rj train, due at 6:50 o'clock, to reach
Seattle j\ midnight.
The cause of the accident was the break
ing of an axle on one of the cars about
the middle of the train, in which there
were thirty or forty cars. All the cars fol
lowing were ditched and both rails of the
track were torn up by the dragging axle
for a distance of nearly a half mile.
SANTA CRUZ SENSATION.
August C. Hihn Fined by Judge
Logan for Contempt of
Court.
He Had Ignored an Order to Produce
a Lease Wanted as Evi-
dence.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Jan. 7.â Angnst C.
Hihn, president of the P. A. Hihn Com
pany, was to-day adjudged guilty of con
tempt of court and ordered to pay a fine of
$100 or serve fifty days in the county jail.
The case of Hoffman vs. F. A. Hihn has
been in court for the past few days, and in
the proceedings it was ordered yesterday
that the Hihn Company produce a lease of
the Pacific Ocean House, which was to be
used as evidence by the plaintiffs, who
wished to prove that the defendant received
$500 which had never been accounted for.
It was ordered by the court that the lease
be brought into court at 10 o'clock this
morning. When the case was called this
morning the Jease had not been handed in
j and a half hour more was given for its pro-
I duction. August Hihn went upon the
I witness-stand and was examined. When
1 the half hour was uv the lease was not
| forthcoming, and then Judge Logan said:
"Yesterday I made an order "that the
1 lease should be produced in court at 10
o'clock to-day, and I am of the opinion
j from the evidence that it is under ttie con-
I trolof the witness on the stand, and that
Ihe can produce it. If not his attorney can.
The witness is in contempt of this court,
and is lined $100 or fifty days in tne
county jail, or PI for every day."
The commitment was drawn and served
jon Mr. Hihn by Sheriff Besse. This after
i noon the line of $100 was paid and the
| lease was delivered in court.

CROCKER'S ARIZONA TRIP
Investigating the Feasibility of
Changing the Southern
Pacific's Route.
Trains Likely to Run Through Globe,
Goldfield and Phoenix to
Gila Bend.
PH CF.NIX, Ariz., Jan. 7.â Colonel C. F.
Crocker, vice-president of the Southern
Pacitic Railroad, accompanied by J. T.
Fassett, ex-Deputy Collector of the Port
of New York, will arrive here in his pri
vate oar to-morrow. To those who know
no bettor, it is given out that Colonel
Crocker has come here fcr a social time,
and tbat Mr. Fassett will be the guest of
Whitelaw Reid during his stay of one
week.
With ethers, however, this statement
carries little weight, for they are certain
that Colonel Crocker is here for the pur
rose of inquiring into the feasibility of
changing the route of the Southern Pacific
and to look over the ground.
This change, as stated in an article in
T11?: Call, contemplates the abandonment
of the present line from Bowie station to
â¢ iila Bend, a distance of '2.(> miles, and a
change of route so that Southern Pacific
trains will run through Globe goldrield,
Florence and Phoenix to Gila Bend.
Borne time ago Francis Cutting and N.
K. Masten did just what Colonel Crocker
will now do; that is, they looKed over this
proposed route. After weighing the diffi
culties and advantages they returned to
San Francisco and reported, it is pre
sumed, favorably. It is to pass final de
cision upon this matter that Colonel
Crocker now visits Phoenix and the other
points most affected by the ""proposed
change. v:, â¢
While he is here. Colonel Crocker will
also receive the report of Colonel G. H.
Honshell, general superintendent of the
Maricopa, .Phoenix and Salt River Valley
Railroad, a part of the Southern Pacific
system, under whose direction a good deal
of canvassing, with a view to obtaining
the opinions of the heaviest shippers of
the towns runst effected, lias been done.
Tucson, the second largest city in the
Territory, has entered an energetic protest
"Kainst its abandonment, and it is to see
whether the other towns most interested
will appreciate to a sufficient extent ttie
favor the Southern Paciiic will confer upon
them, that calls Colonel Crocker hither.

Mutiny Among Seamen on
the British Ship
Gifford.
RATIONS ARE CUT OFF.
Starvation the Captain's Weapon
to Quell the Uprising of
His Men.
WERE DECEIVED AND ROBBED.
A Tacoma Boarding-House Runner
Responsible for the
Trouble.
PORT ANGELES, Wash., Jan. 7.â A
Call correspondent received information
this morning that there was mutiny among
the sailors on board the British four
masted ship Giffori, and that an effort
was being made by the officers to keep the
news from reaching the shore. The cor
respondent was refused permission to go
aboard, but the gruff English captain, who
was pacing his quarterdeck, acknowl
edged that he had twelve men imprisoned
in the forecastle. They bad refused to
work yesterday morning. When asked
what he intended to do in the matter the
captain replied that at present the men
were not getting anything to eat, and he
was oi the opinion that under such circum
stances they would soon be ready to work
again. No one has been allowed to go
ashore since the mutiny occurred, and the
captain is praying for good weather, so he
can put to sea, where further measures
will probably be used to subdue the men.
The trouble arose in Tacoma, where the
crew was shipped for England by a board
ing-house runner. The runner, accom
i panied by the sailors and the British Con
sul, boarded the ship and the seamen
signed the articles, supposing that iliey
would later on be permitted to go ashore
and bring off their clothing. This liberty,
however, was refused, but the runner
agreed to send the sailers' effects aboard.
Just before the ship sailed the men's
canvas bags and chests were sent out, but
instead of being filled with clothing they
were found to contain old grain sackÃ and
rubbish. One man had twelve ragged
vests in his bag, and another's wardrobe
consisted of ladies' undergarments. Nat-

urally the men were enraged, but thiÃ was
not their only complaint. The captain
paid the runner .S4O advance money for
each man, and this sum the boarding
house man appropriated to his own use,
altnough in some instances the men had
been with him only two days.
The captain contends that the trouble is
no fault of his, and consequently he will
force the men to perform their duty.

SAN BERNARDINO TANGLE.
Horticultural Commission Members Refuse
to Give Way to a Ntw
Appointee.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Jan. 7.â
Horticultural Commission affairs in this
county are badly mixed, ana a lively war
is looked for when it comes to determining
who is Commissioner.
The Board of Supervisors, acting under
the authority of the amendment passed
by the last Legislature, providing for a one
man commission, reduced the county
board from three to one, and for that one
put in a new man. The old Commis
sioners are to make a fight, as they claim
that the Board of Supervisors has no
right to reduce the number of Commis
sioners.
They have retained an attorney, and
will tight the case to a finish. Their attor
ney said to a Call correspondent:
"T. c board 13 wrong in this move, as
the onÂ»-man commission applies only
to those counties where no commission ex
isted when the amendment became a law;
but there is no provision authorizing the
Supervisors to reduce the number of Com
missioners now existing.
"When a man is elected to any position :
he is expected to serve not only his term '<
of office but until his successor is ready to |
take up the duties of the office. I will
fight the case in any form it comes up."
The 010 members will recognize Mr.
Pease as the successor of Collins, resigned,
but whether Pease will recognize them as
Commissioners or not is a question.

DENIED AT PORT TOWNSEND.
Judge Scott Scouts the Rumored Engage
ment of His Niece to Genera/
Harrison.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Jan. 7.-
There is more than ordinary interest felt
here in the gossip concerning the probable
marriage of (ieneral Benjamin Harrison
and Mrs. Dimmock, because the lady's
uncle, Judge Scott, a brother of the late
Mrs. Harrison, has resided here for the
past six years, and is one of Port Town
send's most popular citizens.
Judt'e Scott has always corresponded
with General Harrison since coming here
and appears to enjoy a certain degree of
confidence of the latter, probably' owing
to the tact that he has quite as good a
reputation for being: discreet with his
thoughts and speech as has the ex-Presi
dent himself. "When" questioned about the
gossip Judge Scott blushed and protested
he knew nothing of it.
"There's just about as much probability
of General Harrison and Mrs. Dimmock
marrying as that you and I will marry
each other," he said to the gentleman who
questioned him when his attention was
called to a United Press dispatch telling
of the general hou3ecleaning going on at
the Harrison home in Indianapolis.
Judge Scott declared that was nothing
unusual, but his manner left a strong im
pression that even if the marriage should
take place and surprise him it would be a
rather pleasant surpri?;-.
FOR EUREKA'S PROGRESS.
Enterprises Fostered by the
Humboldt Self-Help As-
sociation.
Leading Business Men Banded Together
to Work for the Town's Ad-
vancement.
EUREKA, Cal., Jan. 7. â An organiza
tion which is doing much for Eureka and
Humboldt is the Humboldt Self-Help As
sociation, an organization formed in 1895,
and now baring a membership of about
150 of the leading business men of the
county, and rapidly enlaring its member
ship. As the name suggests, the motto of
the organization is "Self Help," the turn
ing to advantage the native wealth in the
county now lying dormant, the fostering
of the industries now in existence, and
aiding the creation of the industries yet
to be.
Already the organization has done much
good by inspiring citizens of this commu
nity with the desire to support local indus
tries. Plans are in contemplation for the
S. I. ALLAKB, Secretary,
starting of a woolen mill and chair fac
tory, and it is believed that the organiza
tion will accomplish immense benefit to
the county.
The officers of the organization are push
ing, energetic men. J. F. Coonan, the
president, is a leading attorney, chairman
of the Democratic County Central Com
mittee and a heavy real estate owner. E.
Cousins, the first vice-president, is a lead
ing lumberman and 'capitalist. W. S.
Clark, the second vice-president, is the
heaviest owner of real estate in Eureka.
B. I. Ailard, the secretary, is a leading in
surance and real estate broker, secretary of
the Board of Trade of Eureka. <md a most
energetic citizen. Of the other directors,
George Cousins is of the firm of Connick ft
Cousins, one of the leading grocers; A.
Crocker of the firm of Crocker Brothers,
one of the leading dry-goods and clothing
establishments; T. J. 'Langford of the firm
of Ltngford Brothers, boiler-makers and
foundrymen : C. <-. Lundbiad of thn firm
of Ruscoe & Lnndblad, the big furniture
dealers; J. S. Murray, cashier of the Ran
dall Banking Company, and W. F. Gib
bard, the owner of a planing and molding
mill.
That the association, with such men at
its head, will prove a worthy coadjutor of
the Manufacurers' Association of San
Francisco goes without saying. The
people here are enthusiastic over the asso
ciation and its work, and all wish it god
speed in its laudihle endeavor.
FRESNO NOT DEFRAUDED
Grand Jury Charges Found Upon
Investigation to Have Been
Groundless.
The Claims for Bookbinding Work in
County Offices Were Not
Excessive.
FRESNO, Cal.. Jan. 7.-The committee
from the Board of Supervisors, consisting
of Supervisors Garrett, Rose and Sayre,
which was appointed to investigate the
bookbinding job done by Armstrong &
Deguerre of San Francisco, in the Re
corder's and Auditor's offices of this
county, rendered a report to-day. It was
to the effect that the bill of $1899 presented
by the firm for the work should be allowed.
after deducting $54 50. This was the dif
ference between the committee's experted
valuation of the work and the claim. The
report was approved.
This was the bookbinding work over
which the Grand Jury made such a sensa
tional report a few weeks ago. The Grand
Jury valued the work at only $600, which,
it seems, was the valuation put upon it by
a rival bookbinder who had failed to get
the contract.

THE WRATH OF BUDD
Editor Raymond Is in High
Disfavor at the
Capitol.
MAY LOSE HIS POSITION.
The Governor Deplores the Thou
sands Spent in Revising
a Grammar.
FURTHER EXPENSE STOPPED.
Mr. Raymond's Assistants Are Put in
Full Charge of the
Work.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 7.â Tbat W.
H. V. Raymond is not in good favor with
the Stale Board of Public Instruction and
the chief executive was made a very evi
dent fact at the board's session to-day.
That he has but a slight tenure on his office
is also very evident, and that the school
book editor's easy chair may become
vacant in the near future seems not im
provable. To quote the exact words of
Governor Budd, the proposition, is simply
this:
"It will be but a short time until there
will be nothing to do, and I do not intend,
if 1 can help it, that the Scate shall pay
Raymond $250 a month for doing nothing.
I have something to say in this matter,
and I intend to say it. If Mr. Raymond
does not do anything he won't get any
pay. As president of the State Board of
Education I am called upon to sign the
warrant for the salary of the editor-in
chief of the school books. As a member
of the State Board of Examiners I pass
upon his claim.
"The fund is about exhausted, and we
will have to look out for every cent ex
pended on school books. At the present
time we have a staff of editors drawing
large salaries and doing absolutely noth
ing. As far as lam concerned, I believe
that as the two women have done the work
on this grammar they should be retained
until tbe work is finished. I would like
to see those ladies. 1 '
Wheu they appeared the Governor ques
tioned Miss Murphy, and she replied that
she and Mrs. George had furnished the
manuscript for the work, but that Mr.
Raymond had assisted them. They wrote
it, a lesson at a time, frequently rewriting
a lesson two or three timeÃ. They all
conferred together and passed upon the
work untif it was satisfactory to all. The
Governor asked her when she thought the
work could be completed, along the line
of Professor Lange's corrections, and she
said In about two months.
"I would be willing to work all summer
on that book for nothing," Miss Murphy
said, "because I take a pride in it."
"lean understand that," the Governor
replied; "and I would suggest that you
be allowed two months in which to com
plete the work."
This was put in the form of a motion
and carried.
The Governor then asked what work
there was for Mr. Raymond to do, and
Professor Pierce Baid that he believed he
could be kept busy in looking after the
grammar when it went to the printer the
second time. Mr. Raymond said that this
was so â that he would have to follow the
grammar through the hands of the State
Printer. The Governor suggested that as
the two women had done all the work on
the book, in his opjr.ion they were the
proper persons to look after it and read
the proof, if it were right ihat the editors
should read proof.
"For my part," he said, "I don't see
why the proofreader in the State Printing
Ofiice would not be th 2 proper person to
do the work, as he is under a salary of
$4 50 per day for doing that kind of work.
And I see no reason why Raymond should
be retained," he added. "There is nothing
to do."
Professor Kellogg moved to stop edi
torial work on the histories and arith
metic, which motion was carried. The
Governor then suggested that Superin
tendent Black be authorized to stop all
salaries of editors as soon as there was
nothing to do. Some one asked him what
his motion meant. "It means," said the
Governor, "that I do not propose, if I can
help it, that the State shall pay an editor
in-chief $250 a month for doing nothing.
Furthermore, I believe that all, or nearly
all, the work done on that grammar was
done by his two assistants. Miss Anna C.
Murphy and Mrs. Mary C. George."
The Governor said that he was sorry
that the history could not be got out,
but that it was evidently impossible. He
referred to the advanced history, tie be
lieved that the appropriation was sufficient
to complete the primary history.
Secretary of State Brown presented a
plan to the board, which he deems to be
nighly advantageous to the school children
of the State, as far as the purchase of text
books is concerned.
He stated that in preparing data he
found that California pupils had paid at

Opinion of a Former Jiesident of the

SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 7.â A. S. Feck
of Seattle wno traveled extensively in re
cent years in South Africa, residing some
months in the Transvaai republic be
lieves Barney Barnafo and Cecil Rhodes
acting m the interest of the British Gov
ernment, incited and backe â : financially
the Dr. Jameson invasion. He says:
"The Transvaal repub'io is undoubtedly
the srreatest goid-producing country in the
world, and the Kntrlish did not know its
weulth when they drove the Dutch Boers
in there from Cape Colony. Learning
their mistake they want to gain posse-sion
of the territory. I think they were in
league with Dr. Jameson, and have been
using him to the end of securing control.
Dr. Jameson I know personally, and he
has the reputation in Johannesburg of
being a schemer and adventurer."
The Katiirs, Mr. Feet says, are more
friendly to the English than to the Boers,
because the latter have had wars with
them and have occupied their lands.

nent. This ig, of course, what English
men as a people think, it is not wnat the
politicians aay. The Venezuelan affair is
entirely a Government matter. The
universal opinion at first was that Presi
dent Cleveland's message waa^ent out for
political purposes. Now we believe that
the British Government was wrong and
drew down President Cleveland's anger
justly. We accept the justice of Mr.
Cleveland's claim.
"Lord Salisbury's action in refusing ar
bitration is regarded as a political blunder,
and I may say crime, by many right-think
ing Englishmen. I believe a great deal of
good wiil come out of thi3 trouble. I think
it will be the cause of the formation of 3
permanent arbitration court that can set
tle all such disputes between nations. Let
England and America keep peace for
thirty years longer and they can dominate
the whole civilized world."
RECOIiDS A t'EXTURY OLD.
Quiana Jioundaries T)efin.d in an
Ancient Volume.
SEATTLE, WASH., Jan. 7.â Charles H.
Lugrin of this city has in his possession
the original manuscript of a report made
to the British Government in 1781 by a
Commissioner appointed to define the
boundaries of Dutch Guiana. The report
makes a book of nearly 400 pages and con
tains a description of every settlement and
plantation in Dutch Guiana, which is now
claimed by the British, and names all the
original grantees from the Dutch Govern
ment. It defines the boundaries of the
territory claimed by the Dutch, French,
Spanish and Portuguese at that time, in
addition to a large amount of other ex
tremely valuable information.
At tbe request of Lord Salisbury, Mr.
Lugrin is about to forward the book to the
English Premier for inspection by the
British Government. The report has been
in his possession for a number of years,
and as far as he is able to learn, was taken
to Canada from New York by one of the
United Empire Loyalists at the close of the
Revolutionary War.
The repcrt does not bear out the full
claim made by the British Government,
but entirely disposes of the full claim made
by the Venezuelan Government.
The book was compiled for the British
Government with a view of showing the
limits of the Dutch possessions, and was
compiled adversely to Dutch interests. It
deals particularly with the Western bound
ary, and also defines the boundary of
French Guiana.

The card at t ho F.ay District yesterday
was with one exception made up of selling
events. The fields were not large or un
wieldy, yet the talent met with poor suc
cess in landing on the winners. Six well
backed favorites were sent to the post and
but two brought bark the money.
Starter Ferguson and his tlag were both
pood and had. He was in a generous mood
along about the fourth race and made a
presentation. The Burns <fc Waterhouse
was again the recipient of his
gift. With an even break Potentate would
ibly have been about third, but he
was favored with a "shade" and won in a
hmd drive from the horse last away.
There was oniy a fair attendance, but all
seemed supplied with the necessary collat
eral to be dubbed racegoers, for the bet
tmg was lively.
Vinctor made a dismal failure of his race
on Monday, but Instailator, his stable
companion, retrieved the fortunes of the
Btable yesterday. He opened an 8 to 5
favorite in the mile handicap with six
Btaners, but a soured public let him alone
and he went back tv "_' to 1. Semper Lex at
3% and Little Cripple at 5 carried the bulk
of the coin. Sloan kept the favorite back
until the half was reached, when he passed
Kosebud and romped home with his mouth
wide open; an easy winner by three

strong, taking the place from Rosebud by
a long neck.
Salisbury was made a 9 to 5 clioice for
the opening fire-furlong, with ten starters,

the stretch faded away and linished un

Murphy opened a 6 tv .". favorite, but
the educated coin began coming in
on Potentate, rutting his oids from twos
to 7 U embers of the ring boosted
- odds to 2 to 1. Then a plunger's
money went in on Ezell's mare and her
odds came down again to 7 to 5, and Po

Cabrillo beat her out a length with ease in
the fast time of 1:43 W. Old Hy Dv was
third.
Thirteen rank selling-platers started in
the last event, a five-furlong spin. The
wise ones backed Joe Hill down from <> to

George Dickinson in the show.

Competent timers on the track caught

The Palo Alto stake, a handicap for
three-ycar-oias over the short six-furlong
course, will be run to-day. Crescendo is
asked to carry top-weight, 121 younds, but

horse both on the Hat and over the

Requital, and the stake winner Volt, a use

Fred Cowan, Henry Harris, Grannan

Ed Purser backed Unity, and thinking

ITEMS FOR CYCLERS.
The San Frnncihco Koad Club "Will
Join the ! â :i.;i:i- of American
"Wheelmen.
A delegation oi officers of the League of
American Wheelmen visited the Ban
Francisco Road Club last evening and
addressed the members of the ciub upon
the desirability of their joining the leupue.
Chief Consul Kerrigan, Vice-Consul
\Yy r.ne and other speakers addressed the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAKL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 8, 1896.
meeting, and so favorably impressed the
Road Ciub members that they have de
cided to join the leairue in a body at once, i
The committee v.ill visit the Olympic !
Cyclers next Friday night with the same j
object in view, and will call on the other j
local clubs on their meeting nights during
this month.
T. A. Griffiths and Emil Languetin, on
singles, paced by A. L. Holling and S. B.
Vincent on a tandem, will ride a century
around the bay next Sunday in the en
deavor to secure the record for the course
for their club, the Bay City Wheelmen.
Griffith's will ride his wheel geared to 120,
and this will be a practical test of its
serviceability on the road for long dis
tances. The ride will, therefore, be
watched with considerable interest, as
since the article in The Call last Satur
day about Grilh'ths' 120 gear a great many
have spoken of their intention of getting
higher gears on their wheels.
Clarence Davis, the fast San Jose racer,
is no longer connected with Varney's, and
will now probably go on the road for a
local house.

, corner of Leavenworth street and Golden
| Gate avenue. The association has had a
I successful year, and nearly all the bicycie
j houses of toe City have joined it.
The San Jose Road Club will hold a
five-mile road race next Sunday over the
I East San Jose course. McFarland will
| ride from scratch, which seems assurance
that the record will be lowered.
It must be understood that the various
changes in the racing rules of the League
of American Wheelmen, which have been
mentioned in the papers of late, are only
suggestions which will be offered at the
meeting of the National Assembly at Bal
timore in February. Similar suggestions
have been sent in from all parts of the
country, and it is impossible to say what
the National body will do. Those offered
by the local representative of the Racing
Board, K. M. Welch, are very well thought
of by the cycling people here and by Mr.
Gideon, the chairman of the board at
Philadelphia, but how the National As
sembly will take to them is doubtful.
THAT CLEVER FORGERY
Bankers Believe It Is the Most
Skillful Ever Done
Here.
Captain Lees Has a Theory as to How
and When Forger Dean Left
the City.
The all-absorbin? topic of conversation
in bankinsr circles yesterday was the clever
forgery of A. H. Dean on the Nevada
Bank, which was characterized as the fin
est piece of work of the kind ever done in
this City.
Captain Lees is not of the same opinion.
He said last night that the same kind of
work done by professionals in Juno, 1893,
was cleaner and better than the work of
Dean, and in his opinion could not be
surpassed. At that time two checks wen
raised from $38 to $3800, and from $6o to
$6500.
â¢'1 have nothing new to give for publica
tion," said the captain. "I have been ;
working on the case all day picking up
odda and ends an>i piecing them together
to see if I could discover the identity of
the forger. Everything that could possi
bly interest the public has been published
and what information I have since re
ceived would bt of no interest to the
public"
The captain made an investigation as to
tbe statement of the office-boy, Wiley Q.
Lytle. that Dean drove to either i;>_'!t or
14L'!t Valencia street, where hn said he !
resided. This is in the neighborhood of
the Southern Pacific depot at Twenty-fifth
and Valencia streets, and the captain is
satisfied that Dean's telling the boy that
he lived on Valencia street was a ruse.
"Dean had, no doubt," said the captain,
"taken the train to San Jose. From there
he would tnlce the narrow-pun^p to Nile?
and from Niles he would ro to Lathrop,
where he would catch the overland train.
"That occurred to me when the boy
mude hia statement, and I wished simply
to satisfy myself on the point yesterday.

STATE GRANGE MEETING
Charges Against Commission
Merchants to Be Inquired
Into.
WILL EDUCATE THE FARMERS.
A Movement on Foot to Start a Free
Market in This City on the
Water Front.
The executive committee of the State
Grange, which is clothed with full author
ity to act in all matters pertaining to the or
der, was in session yesterday at the Iluss
House. One important matter before the
Grange was the request of Highland
Grange that it should take up a charge
made by Mrs. M. G. Norton of Highland
Grange against Trobock & Bergen, com
mission merchants of this City. The alle
gation is that they sold her goods at a
higher price than they returned to her,
and Docketed the difference, stating, when
charted with the act. that it was the usual
and proper custom among the commission
men of San Francisco, in all cases wnere
single packages of fruit are sold.
Highland Grange takes the ground that
the transaction was improper and dis
honest â first, because the shippers have
never agreed to such action; second, that
there is not on any day any established
wholesale price for fresh fruit; and third,
because the law says it is a crime. As to
this iatter point Highland Grange has
taken legal advice and has been advised
that the transaction was in violation of
section 507 of the Penal Code and consti
tuted the crime of embezzlement.
For the purpose- of making a test case j
Highland Grange requests the State j
Grange to cause the arrest and trial of the
members of the firm. The matter was re
ferred to W. W. Greer, master of the State
Grange, and B. F. Walton, with power to !
act.
The committee will probably be guided
in its action by its investigation as to
whether or not, as alleged, it is a common j
practice. If it was only a single act of an I
individual. Highland Grange is understood
not to press the matter of arrest, but if it !
is a general practice, it will urge that a
test be made in this case where evidence i
is available.
The executive committee also had under
consideration the proposal to establish a
free market on the water front, as to which
a committee of Highland Grange is in cor
respondence with the Harbor Commission
ers. Edward F. Adams, representing
Highland Grange, had a conference yester
day with President Colnon of the Harbor
Commissioners, as a result of which a
conference of representative growers is
likely to be called to consider the subject.
\V. W. Greer and 15. F. Walton were ap
pointed a committee to represent the
State G range, should any such conference
be called.
The educational committee was in
structed to provide for a great popular
meeting of Uio farmers of the State to be
he!d under the auspices of the grange, at
.Santa Cruz, during the coming summer.
The educational committee of the .State
Grange laid before the meeting the draft
of a plan for rural study circles, to be con
ducted on i lie Cbatauqua plan, under the
auspices of the siran^e. The plan met
wit h approval, but was referred back to
the educational committee to be perfected
in its financial aspects. This committee
will meet in a few days to further consider
the subject. The grange is preparing for
an earnest campaign on educational lines.
UNION EXECUTIVE BOARD.
Wowu'i Chrl-<tiÂ»ii Tenptiaam Vnion
Will Celcbimt* Kram-liine Day.
The State Executive Board of the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union of
California held its quarterly meeting at
the headquarters, 132 McAllister street,
yesterday. There eras a largo attendance,
in which various parts of the State were
represented.
It was decided to urge nil the unions to
Dush vigorously the work of circulating
petitions asking for legislative divorce
ment of the saloon and grocery.
The birthday of the president, Mrs. B.
Sturtevant Feet, was fixed as franchise
day, which will be celebrated by all the
unions throughout the State, with special
attention to equal suffrage.
Resolutions were passed pledging the
unions to do all in their power to make the
coming lecture tour of John G. Wooley a
success; also, recognizing the increasing
frequency of temperance sermons by the
clergy and the greater readiness ot the
press to publish reports of the same.
Much time was spent in the discussion
of ways and means concerning the an
nual National Convention of the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union, to be Held
here at a date not yet decided.
SPORTSMEN IN SESSION
An Association That Will Es
tablish Branches in the
Country.
Federal Authorities Refuse to Investi
gate Obstructions to Navigation
in Sloughs.
The Sportsmen's Protective Association
held a larire and enthusiastic meeting last
night at K. of R. B. Hall, corner of Mason
and O'Farrell streets.
Thomas Case}' of this City and G. "W.
Dennis of Alumeda, who had been ap
pointed a committee at a recent meeting
of the association to investigate the mat
ter of blockading navigable sloughs by cer
tain clubs that have leased preserves in
Solano and Sonoma counties, reported
that they had conferred with some of the
Federal authorities on the subject of ob
structions to navigation, but received very
little encouragement.
Mr. Casey said that the sloughs now
blockaded in the Suisun marshes are un
questionably navigable, Tind that he had
Batislied himself on that, score last Sunday
by measurements taken in the presence of
witnesses of the depth of the waterways in
question at hich and low water.
A committee of five members, namely,
T. Casey, F. Staples, It. Boyer. G. W.
Dennis and H. Battee, was appointed by
the chair to confer to-day with an attorney
with the view of prosecuting the clubs
through whose intercession those sloughs
or waterways in question were blockaded,
thereby causing an obstruction to legiti
mate navigation.
The association, at the request of some
of the meniners, decided to engage the ser
vices of an attorney to defend tiie sports
men who have been enjoined by the Ibis
Preserve Club from shooting upon its
overflowed lands in the Suisun marshes.
The sportsmen of Holano County have en
gaged legal talent to defend the alleged
poachers from Vallejo, Benicia, Suiiun,
etc., who have been afso enjoined.
A committee of five was appointed to
visit the principal towns of Solano and
Contra Costa counties for the purpose of
organizing annex clubs to the assoe:a;ion,
which requires assistance from the sports
men of the country, who are being yearly
deprived of a pastime they so dearly love
by wealthy shooting clubs.
A committee on printinc, oiatorv, etc.,
and composed of Messrs. Dennis, Butler,
l-'it/.siminons, McKae and Snyder, was
also appointed by the president, which w'il
report progress at a special meeting of the
association which will he held in the same
building on tiie evening of the L'Jd ins>t.
The new tablet to the memory of Mary
Queen of Scots recently raised in Peter

WEDNESDAY JANUARY 8, 1898
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Calling it a "popular loan" will never
make it popular.
The need of the time is an immediate
ultimatum on bond issues.
Between Cleveland and the goldbugs
the bonds of sympathy are many.
Since Democrats must fight among them
selves it is well that they tight Buckley.
The noisy bonding band plays on, and
every note increases the debt of the people.
The Cubans are marching on Washing
ton as well as on Havana, and recognition
is in the air.
If Cleveland does not look out the next
emergency he will have to face will be an
impeachment.
The debate en the bond bill in the Senate
will be long enough to get all around
G rover, as fat as lie is.
When the next Tan-American Congress
assembles Cuba should have a voice in it,
and a free voice at that.
The Academy of Sciences has sworn oS
the old and will try to make the new year
the beginning of a new era.
It ijegins to look as if General Gomez
. take rank among the liberators of
America, and share honors with Bolivar.
lue foreign policy of this country should
B t a iimit to th<t barbarisms of the Turk
as well as to the land-grabbing of the
Tlie Senate bill providing for the issue
of inure silver instead of more bonds will
c and give the goldbugs a
duel: fit.
The administration is willing to issue
any kimi of bunds except such as would
provide for the construction of the Nica
raguan canal.
It appears that in the matter of State
il books there is wanted a good trial,
not only for the books but for the official
in charge of them.
The voice that demands protection for
Armenia speaks in the language of civili
zation and Christianity, but the meaning
is that of a common humanity.
in his various loans, Cleveland has fur
nished the country with a good many
issues for the next campaign, and poor old
Democracy will have to carry them all.
It is again reported that Harrison is a
candidate for matrimony, but perhaps in
this as in tne Presidential race he is only
receptive, and waits the possibilities of the
leap year.
Salisbury continues to be opposed to an
arbitration of the Venezuelan boundary,
but it is believed ho will have sense enough
to consent to what will be called a "diplo
matic equivalent."
It would be a good plan for the Senate
to pass the 3 per cent bond bill at once,
and let the country see if Cleveland would
have the audacity to veto It and stick to
his 4 per cent issue.
There is said to be in the Senate a
majority of ten for free silver, and con
sequently the gold bugs have to work all
their schemes through the Cleveland mill,
and be quick about it.
Kaiser William evidently meant busi
ness in recognizing the complete inde
pendence of the Transvaal, for he will ap
point a German Consul at Pretoria and
try to build up a trade.
There are two things the Senate should
do before it enters upon the discussion of
partisan measures â one is to pass tne tariff
bill for greater revenue, and the other is to
re-enact the reciprocity law.
The San Diego Union issued a large New
Year's number consisting in its special fea
ture of exhaustive descriptive articles de
voted to the resources and attractions of
San Diego, and illustrative and artistic
pictures.
The Marysville Appeal appeared on the
Ist mat. as a carefully prepared special
edition containing historical data of local
interest and a statement of the lines on
which the future prosperity of Marysviile
will jiroceed.
Chamberlain intended to make his co
lonial policy a vigorous one. but he has
found so many of the colonies cavorting
aronnd over the land of other folks that
b.Â» lias had to pu! in all his time trying to
stand the other folks off and has no time
in attend to the < olonies themselves.
President Bartleti ... the Nicaraguan
Canal Company ma :ood point
against the report of the Government
commission by calling attention to the
fact that the commission spent only four
teen days i;i examining the line of the
canal and tiu-u undertook to set aside
the estimates made by men who had
spent years on the work.
The efforts of the Young Men's Institute
to prect in this City a suitaole building of
Us own should be :oi\iially supported Â«md
assisted by all liberal men. Every asso
ciation tluit tends to surround the youth
of tbe City witli good influences confers
benefits that are feU beyond the limits of
its membership, and in thi.> way the Young
Hen's Institute has already rendered a
tent service to all to merit the co
oiÂ»eration of all in ihe enterprise it has
now uudertakin.
AN OPPORTUNITY SEIZED.
The cheerful openness with which the
Southern Pacific Company announces its
intention to take immediate advantage of
an opportunity to raise the rates on east
bound freight not only furnishes a com
plete clew to its conduct in the past, but
throws a strong light upon its future con
duct if it succeeds in securing the passage
of a funding bill and the defeat of the
Nicaragua canal. "It will be, I under
stand," said one of the company's princi
pal officers the other day, "about three
months before the lines operating via
Panama wilt be able to supplement their
present inadequate service, and we pro
pose to take the opportunity of making a
profit on the business we may do in the
meantime." This announcement is ex
plained by another, to the effect that the
raise will be made on articles for which
there is isthmian competition, and by the
declaration that on these articles the com
pany is tired of getting only expenses and
a small prolit out of the traffic.
It has been decided to advance the rate
to Buffalo and Pittsburg on canned goods
25 per cent and on borax 50 per cent, the
rate to New York on canned goods, borax,
wine, beans and grain 50 per cent, and on
brandy in wood 41 per cent, and the rate
to Chicago on canned goods 15 per cent.
The Panama Railway, with its Pacihc Mail
ally, will make still higher advances on
all these commodities.
These advances are to be made simpjy
because the power to make them came
from the creation of a monopoly by an
agreement between the Pacilic Mail and
the Panama Railway. Mr. Huntington
directs both the Pacific Mail and the
Southern Pacific. "Whether the industries
of California can bear this tremendously
increased strain is a matter for the pro
ducers and manufacturers themselves to
determine.
The boldness of this move is its most
significant feature. It is taken at a time
when efforts are being made by Congress
to rlace construction and control of the
Nicaragua canal in the hands of the
United States Government, and it seems
to indicate an assurance on the part of Mr.
Huntington that the effort will fail and
that the Government will not become a
factor in the regulation of overland traffic.
It betrays an equal confidence in the pass
ing of a funding bill, as it seems incredi
ble that Mr. Huntington, unless he is per
fectly sure of his ground, would dare thus
to challenge the opponents of the funding
scheme to do their worst.
California is thus placed in a deplorable
position. It is given distinctly to under
stand that its industries are to be more
severely ridden by a monopoly than ever;
that it^ already meager prolits are to be
reduced, and that it seed not expect any
relief either from the Nicaragua canal or
the defeat of the funding bill. The situa
tion is very serious and urgent and calls
for the greatest effort to avert its evils.
THE NEW ACADEMY.
After many years of injurious wrang
ling the Academy of Sciences has been re
organized. The old regime, which has held
power for so long, has been forced to sur
render to a faction which calls itself more
progressive. The new idea is to expand the
membership by taking in some who are
not professional scientists. That was the
principal issue, though minor ones of a
somewhat personal character cropped up.
The old plan was to limit the membership
to those with whom the pursuit of scien
tific studies is a lifetime matter.
The triumph of the new and more liberal
plan will undoubtedly find general ap
proval. The efforts of the most advanced
scientific researches are largely directed to
the securing of practical results which
shall bring substantial benefit to the race.
Thus the most brilliant achievements and
the greatest personal renown have been
secured by Pasteur in his search for means
to cure and prevent dreadful human ail
ments, by Lombroso in unveiling the
mysterious association between crime and
congenital mental defects, and by Edison
in devisinc ingenious means for facilitat
ing business.
California offers the most alluring field
in the world for scientiGc investigation of
strange conditions, whose proper under
standing would add vastly to the measure
of human happiness. Those most aware
of the need of such study are not to be
sought among the absorbed students who
have no vital contact with the world, but
in the great army of earnest and intelli
gent men and women who are the active
agents for extracting nature's benefits. It
is well that a reasonable number of these
should be admitted into the Academy of
Sciences. They will bring with them a
broad understanding and that order of
hard common-sense which knows how to
organize living forces and suppress petti
ness and personal spites and jealousies.
The election of David Starr Jordan as
president furnishes the key to the new
situation. Besides being a scholar of ex
cellent scientific attainments and broad
comprehension, he is eminently a man of
the world-building type, and is in close
touch with the stern practical side of life.
When we add to these qualifications an
incredible capacity for work, a fine organ
izing and directing ability, an eager fond
ness for knowledge and a kindly and gen
erous disposition, we have a complete
portrait of the man for the place. That
he will brine to bear upon the conduct of
the academy all the qualities which fit him
for its direction, and make it tiie focus ol
all the scattered and dormant energies
which are ready to be applied in utilizing
the institution for the good of the people,
there is every reason to believe.
THE CAUSE OP ARMENIA.
The affairs of Venezuela, Cuba and the
Transvaal Lave to a considerable extent
distracted public attention from the mas
sacres in Armenia. These atrocities, how
ever, have by no means ceased. Nothing
as yet has been done to check them. They
still constitute the most serious outrage
that offends the world at this time, and
are the more offensive inasmuch as they
are not outrages of one nation against
another but of barbarisms and supersti
tions against humanity itself.
For the sake of no international disputes,
however great or exacting, can the Ameri
can people afford to overlook or neglect
tbe despairing cry of the wretched people
in Armenia. Their call appeal to every
generous and noble instinct of the heart.
Nations may hesitate, but individuals
must to every need of humanity respond
with as much of help as each can give.
It lies not in our power unaided to right
the wrongs of that stricken people, nor to
stay the hand of the merciless Turk, but
we can do something. A resolute ex
pression of the moral sentiment of
America will be felt in Europe, and when
a sentiment equally strong is awakened
there, the governments of the nations will
be forced to act, the cruelty will be staved
and another great victory won for the
cause of humanity al! round the world.
It is fortunate that at this time, when
public attention is so largely attracted to
other things, we are to have a mass
meeting nest Monday to recall this great
duty to our people. Nearly all the greater
cities of tbe Union have spoken on the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY S, 1896.
subject and we must speal: also. Our
voice, like that of our sister cities, will
speak with the tone of no class or creed or
race, but of a common humanity. It will
be the voice of man speaking for his fellow
man, and the heart of every citizen should
add feeling to eive it emohasis.
The duties of our Government in refer
ence to matters of this kind are not clearly
defined. We have a Monroe doctrine for
this Hemisphere, but no settled policy for
dealing with the rest of the world. The
Turkish problem is not a problem for us.
We have no National interests in that part
of the globe to be affected one way or an
other whether the flag that flies above the
Golden Horn bear the crescent or the cross.
We have thus far interfered there only to
protect American citizens residing under
Turkish rule. This, however, is not the
full limit either of our right or our duty.
The old saying, "blood is thicker than
water," applies in this base. The influ
ence of our Government should be exerted
to put a stop to such atrocities as those com
mitted in Armenia, whether the victims
are our own people or those of another
race.
The importance of making the coming
mass-meeting truly representative of the
City will be felt by all who take an interest
in the subject. Those who have issued the
call for it have arranged to make it include
all citizens without regard to any differ
ences on other mattera that might exist.
All that is left to be done, therefore, is for
the people generally to make up their
minds to attend the meeting. It should
be large enough, to assure the speakers of
the public indorsement of their words and
make it known to all that San Francisco
stands with the rest of the civilized world
in upholding every cause that makes for
the welfare of humanity.
A QUEER DISCOVERY.
The looseness with which the public af
fairs of the City have been conducted is
illustrated in an interview with Peter T.
Seculovich, published in Tuesday's Call.
Mr. Seculovich, who is a heavy taxpayer,
recalls an act of the Legislature approved
April 2, 1866, and amended in 1868, grant
ing the right to construct and operate a
street railway in San Francisco from the
foot of Post street to Dupont, thence to
Market and out Fifth and Kentucky streets.
He discovers that a condition of the fran
chise was that the City might buy the
road at the end of fifteen years from the
date of its completion, if the municipality
should so elect, and he argues that as the
road was completed in July, IS7O, and that
as the City has not bought the road, the
franchise has expired. This is a conclusion
of law which only a regular adjudication
might be sufficient to establish.
]!'> makes another point, however, and
it is much more tangible. It is that the
act granting the franchise required the
company to pay to the City annually a
license fee of $50 for each car that it oper
ated. He discovers that this has not been
paid, and believes that the present owner
of the road, the Market-street Railway
Company, ia liable for the whole amount,
which Mr. Scculovich estimates at $100,000.
He mnkes the reservation that possibly the
Board of Supervisors at some time relieved
the company of this obligation. If so, it
would be as interesting to know why it
was done as it is to speculate on the rea
sons for a failure to collect the license fee
in rase it was not done.
There likely would bo no more interest
ing pastime for some body of public-spir
ited citizens than to dig into the old rec
ords of the City and ascertain to what ex
tent the enforcement of laws has been neg-
lected and for what reasons. Xow that the
City Hall is being finished at last with a
very handsome and imposing dome it
might even be worth while to ascertain
why and under what circumstances the
City Hall Park, lying betwsen Market
street and the municipal building, was di
vided into lots and sold; whether the
transfer was legal and what ia the mean
ing of the fact that these lots are covered
with worthless shanties.
A digging up of the old records might
result in the discovery of things contain
ing all the fascinating elements of a
romance. Such burrowing might weaken
the foundations of a proud reputation
here and there, but in some cases the
sacredness of the grave intervenes and in
most others there is simply a blank ob
livion. The citizens who have gone into
history as strong and brave patriot.^ in the
office of Supervisor would not make a
formidable list; and yet there never has
been a time when a man of brains and
character could not have made himself the
idol of the people by doini; his whole duty
a3 a member of the Board of Supervisors.
The Market-street Railway Company
will not be worried over any discoveries
that Mr. Seculovich may make. It knows
too much about politics, Boards of Super
visors and bosses for that.
THE MUGWUMP ERA CLOSED.
The sudden change of the mugwumps from
admiration to detestation of Mr. Cleveland is
the conclusion of a curious political episode in
our history.
When the late Mr. Blame was nominated for
President by the Republican party, the mug
vurnps, at that time confined to tho ranks of
the Republicans, resented his selection on the
ground that ho was an unsafe man. Mr. Cleve
land had carried this State by a large and even
unprecedented majority. His opponent in that
canvass was Judge Folger, a man oÂ£ the high
est and purest character and of great and un
questionable abilities, and objectionable only
on the ground of his political principles.
Every Democrat in the State was bound to
vote against him, but solely because lie was a
Republican.
A better man for Governor, personally, was
never nominated in this State. The personal
character and the natural ability of Mr. Cleve
land were not known, or, so far as they were
known, they came far short of mugwump re
quirements. According to the standard of
mugwump judgment, which professes to take
account of intrinsic qualifications rather than
mere political availability, Mr. Cleveland's
career had been unsatisfactory. It had been
an average American career, unless certain in
cidents of it should be set apart. The sou ot a
minister in New Jersey, he had been a teacher
in a deaf and dumb or perhaps a blind asy
lum, but his own education had been hap
hnzard.
The fact that he was elected Sheriff of Buf
falo not very long afl-r he had taken up his
residence in that thriving town indicates that
ho must have boon one of the "boys'" accord
ing to the contemptuous characterization of
the mugwump leader. Afterward Mr. Cleve
land was elected Mayer of Buffalo, and tie
would not have been elected to that office if
the people of tbe town had not had political
attachment to him. They knew him person
ally and they trusted him as a fellow citi2en.
Probably there is no other city of this Union
where the frame of municipal politics is played
more skillfully than in the prosperous town on
Lake Erie.
Ji might seem surprising, therefore, that the
mugwumps should go to Buffalo, of all places,
to find their political hierophant. Apparently
Judge Folger embodied the qualities ior which
the mugwumps were yearning, lie was a man
ot a spotless moral character and his political
principles were purely Republican. Appar
ently Sir. Cleveland was far from satisfying the
supcrsensitlvc mugwump perceptions; but he
had the quality which they lack, and instinc
tively they turned to him because of their de
ficiency in that attribute of manliness. Vitally,
Mr. Cleveland supplied a defect In the mutr
wump constitution.
Tiie mugwump revolt against him seems to
do violent in its hysterical manifestations, but
it amount* to nothing. It is a mere surface
manifestation. Mr. Cleveland baa now back
of him the sentiment of tbe American people,
and it is a safe reliance.
Whatever may happen, we shall at least have
a deliverance from emasculated mugwump
politics.â New York Sun. â 
AROUND THE CORRIBORS.
"Yes, if the Americans in South Africa say
Kruger, the President oi the Transvaal, is
right, then you ran bet it is true." remarked
the Honorable R. m. Dsggett. ex-Minister to
the Sandwich Inlands. aÂ« he took a seat with
some gentlemen who found a little time to
chat during the lunch hour in the Palace

'â¢What's matter, Dag?" inquired a friend.
"Why, this business down in Africaâ this
â  row among the Germans and English. I say
that if the few Americans down there have de- i
eiaed that old Kruger is in the right it must I
be so. You never see Americans taking sides i
with the wrong element. They are careful to !
defend the right man all the "
"How do we know that "
"Wait a minute. Let me tell you about the
American people. You don't seem to be con
versant with our methods. First of all, Ameri
cans are disposed to look carefully into any-

thing of that kind before they announce
themselves, and when they reach, a conclusion
it is generally based upon a careful study of
the conditions. Secondly, there are not a suffi
cient number of them there to take absolute
possession, and they would on that account act
with discretion. Another point is this : There
has been a good deal of talk lately about Eng
land not wanting a fight. Don't fool yourself
on that point. They cun put up one of the
liveliest wars you ever saw, and when English
men begin to fight they fight like a house afire.
"The whole thing rests on the fact that the
Boers have been driven from place to place iv
South Africa, and finally, when they got to the
Transvaal, they declared that they had had
enough, and warned Enpiand to stand back
and keep her hands oft". Every American
down there knew that, and when this last
racket began they saw the condition of things,
and stood in with the Doers.
"When I talk about the habits and general
gait of the people of tiii.s country I am discus
sing something lam familiar with. Why, take
it up in the mining camps of this State. There
used to be a $8 a month mining tnx, and any
body who paid it could work along the placer
streams. Occasionally a Chinaman would be
ousted, and when the matter was sifted down
to the boitom it Invariably turned out that thf
purely American miners had nothing to do
with it. 1 have seeu Americans go twenty-five
miles to see that a Chinaman got justice so
long es he complied v. ith the law and put up
his money to work his claim, and you know
that Americans have no particular love for
Chinamen. Eut it is that innate sense of
justice that always as.-erts itself among then.
That is why I think the Boers in South Africa
arc in the right. The few Americans who arc
there have taken sides with Kroger, and you
can bet his cause is a just one.
'â¢There is no race of people in the whole
world so willing to do the right thing as the
Americans, and they generally succeed in do
ing the correct thing at the proper time. The
Chinese matter I refer to came to my notice
when I was a mere boy, just fresh from the
woods of Ohio and able to receive impressions.
All my life I have found Americans just and
Bquare in controversies that arise among
people of other nations, and on that basis and
that basis alone I will bet that the inhabitants
of the Transvaal have a just grievance ana
kicked at the right time. :>
A USEFUL HOUSE GOWK.
A flannel of black and sage-green siripp?,
with trimraines of black satin ribbon, forms
this charmiug and comfortable house gown,
which is fitted to the figure by one dart on
either side of the front, has tha usual back
forms, â which form godet effects below lhc
waist. The sleeve is of the leg-o'-mutton
fih ape.
A light blue crepon had the Jaee set on to
outline a square yoke, and falling over the
sleeves. An incn border of brown iur finished
the edge of the ruffle. The front of the gown
was hooKed invisibly and a bow of wlaite rib
bon with long ends finished the front. The
neck had a collar of white satin, with tiny
points of the blue edged with fur set on either
Biae of the front.
A plain untrimmed wrapper of pink flannel
is most serviceable, as it may easily be
laundered. A collarette of white nainsook
ivith a narrow val. lace can bo made detach
able with turn up cuffs to match.
Or a pointed lace collar may be made into
elaborate accessory by tewing a ruffle of bright
striped ribbon around it, making it into a
point at each point of the lace collar and tack
ing it there. A white flannel frown, with
white lace collar and blue and white striped
ribbon was vory dainty. A stock collar of the
ribbon finished' the neck.
The model is very useful for wraDpers of
wash fabrics, and is at the same time appro
priate for making up handsome tea gowns of
nny fabric, the trimming changing the char
acter of the garment entirely.

NATIONAL WAR SCHOOLS
Military ami Nuvul Cadet Life De-
tcribed by Lieutenant W. K. H;uu
ilton of the Army.
Lieutenant W. R. Hamilton, U. S. A,,
professor of military science at the Uni
versity of Nevada, lectured last night in ;
the Y. M. C. A. auditorium unpon the
military and naval schools of the United
States. His pleasing descriptions of cadet
life and his narrations of the customs of
the Nation's schools of warfare were illus
trated with many stereopticon views of â 
scenes and incidents of peculiar interest.
He speke of the courses of instruction
together with the daily routine work from
the time the youth enters West Point, "a I
beast," previous to his assignment i
of a uniform, until, having survived the
ignominy of being a "pleb" or first-year
man, lie passes on up through the classes I
and is graduated at the end of four years. !
if he be among the first live he may {
choose any department of the service en- \
gineering, cavalry, infantry, artillery and !
so on. If he be in the next ten or more,
according to the size of the class and the
positions available for new cers, he may
choose any branch but engineering.
Every cadet has to attend dancing
school, the grace and ease r.c- I
<juired from the art being considered j
requisite to the comi'letp training of the |
offteer. The only exception to this rule is
the youth whose parents express con
scientious soruplps against dancing.

THE RACETRACK ROBBERY.
Opening of the Preliminary Ex
amination Before Judge
Low.
DISCUSSION ANENT A MASK.
Several Witnesses Give Interesting
Testimonyâ Defendants Not Yet
in the Toils.
A strange, mixed crowd contributed its
varied quota to the wonted scenes of
: Judge Conlan's courtroom yesterday at
I the trial of the three men charged with
i the Christmas robbery near the Ingleside
track. Strange to say, a large number of
I women were present amid the nondescript
! throng, and one lady of distinguished ap
i pearance sat near the prisoners during the
entire session of the court. No one seemed
to know who she was, and her pale face,
: shrouded in its sombei drapery of widow's
i mourning, attracted no little attention,
: both from its youthful beauty and its look
i of deep absorption.
Judge Low occupied the bench, Judge
â  Conlan having declined to sit in the case.
GARDNER.
THE MEN CHARGED WITH THE INGLESIDE ROBBERY.
It is said that the reason of Judge Conlan's
declining to act on the trial was that com
ments had been made regarding ins prob
able attitude toward the defendants; and
that in order to save himself from any
danger of being misundertood and per
â  haps misinterpreted he had asked his
learned colleague to sit in judgment as
consulting magistrate.
The three young men accused of the
robbery occupied chairs in the center of
, the courtroom. Henry Robert Gardner,
the tallest, and apparently the youngest of
the trio, is a harmless-luokiiig chap, who
reminds one of an overgrown schoolboy.
Patrick "Welch, with his ardent auburn
hair, mustache and week-old beard, ap
pears to regard the whole proceeding as a
somewhat novel even though occasionally
tiresome experience. Joseph Middlemiss,
the remaining figure in the trio, is cer
tainly the brightest of the lot, if looks be
any indication. Rather short in stature,
with a bright and somewhat attractive
face, his bead-like eyes took in all that
was going on.
The defendants were represented by
Henry C. Gesford of Napa, Richard Porter
Ashe and Messrs. Tobin and Gleason.
Throughout the proceedings Mr. Gesford
seemed to be the spokesman, and while
gentlemanly harmony and strict adher
: ence to professional etiquette were the
order of the day, this fact did not prevent
: an occasional barristerial tilt between the
legal luminary from the vineyard belt and
E. P. Mogan, the prosecuting attorney.
W. S. Leake, secretary of the l'acific
Coast Jock .-y Club, was the first witness
placed on the stand. When interrogated
regaiding his residence he said |ie knew
not what answer to make. H*e said be
was Postmaster at Sacramento, though
'. he sent in his resignation some time
i ago. When his resignation shouid be
j accepted he would be better able to speak
! definitively in reference to his legal habi
tat. His testimony tended to prove the
! identity of the leathern hag exhibited in
court as the one stolen from Mr. Clarke on
; the nieht of the robbery.
Arnold Kirehwey, night clerk at the
I Branch lodging-house on Market street,
! when subjected to examination, said that
i Welch, Middlemiss and a man resembling
I Gardner had occasionally taken rooms at
that establishment, and that they seemed
to be on terms of intimacy with a man
named Webster. Thus far the name of
Webster has not appeared in the case, and
it was made the subject matter of several
questions from both sides. It appeared
that Middlemiss seldom slept in the
house, but frequently came in the morn
ing to awaken Webster. The witness
would call him first and then Middlemiss
would come to the house to see whether
Webster was up.
Mr. Gesford then took the witness in
hand. Kerchwey said t c Branch Ho USD
was located on MarKet street, opposite tne
Baldwin. The man Webster had been a
steady lodger at the place since October of
last year. Gardner, or a man resembling
him, had taken a room on three or four
occasions. There was a register of arrivals
at the lodging-house, and in it the namea
of lodgers were entered by the clerk.
Since last year a new book had been
opened, and the witness was unable to say
whether the old one was in existence or
not Wek-n and the slender man usually
rook a room on Saturday nights. Edward
Fintelmann w:im tl.e day clerk and Torked
daily until 8 o'clock in the evening 1 , when
the witness went on duty, remaining at
bis post until morning, lie bad been on
duty riming these hours on Christmas eve
and Christmas night.
"Wi at c irt of a lodging-house do you
keep?" aÂ«ked Mr. Gesford, winninjriy.
"What do you charge for rooms?"
"Twenty, twenty-live and fifty cents per \
night," answered "the witness.
"A first-cluss house, evidently," rejoined ]
the attorney. "I suppose you never re
quire a certificate of good character from
your guests, now, do yon?"
This question appeared to mystify the
Witness, and he seemed quite" relieved
when told he could leare the stand, the
Judge, however, ordering him to bring the
registers of the Branch lodging-house to :
court in'the afternoon.
B il Brrliner, a tick"t-seller at the Ingle- \
side track, was next, placed on the stand, i
He recognized Gardner and Middlemiss.
He had noticed them particularly on
Christmas day., as tney had remained loi
tering near the entrance to the trackabout
4 o'clock in the afternoon. The two men I
were engaged in conversation with two i
others whom lie could not recognize. The I
witne.-js stated he had been engaged at che ;
track smej Thanksgiving day.
William E. Dennis, a colored man of
middle age, said c was assistant janitor j
at the [ngleside track, and had seen toe
defendant Welch in the barroom with a
man who looked like Gardner and another ;
man of vorv high stature whom he did not
know. The time was about 6 o'clock in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY *8, 1896.
the juternoon of Christmas day. He saw
tne same three men the next morning at
8 20 o'clock in a restaurant on Poweil
street.
In answer to a question from Mr. Gesford !
the witness stated that when he had ob- i
served the three men at tne bar he was |
speaking with the head janitor, Worthing
ton by name, and was standing about fif- j
tÂ«en feet away from t!iem. Something in
their manner had aroused his suspicions, I
an Ihe had remarked to Worthington : '"It
looks as though somebody was going to be
stood up"
"btop. stop!" ejaculated Mr. Gesford,
peremptorily. "Your Honor. I want that
answer stricken from the record. The
witness is on the stand to state what he
saw, not what he said. I don't want my
clients to be condemned as criminals be
fore even the preliminary examination is
over."
"Never mind, never mind, 1 ' was Judge
Low's soothing rejoinder. "We'll strike it
out with pleasure," and it was so ordered. |
At the openinc of the afternoon session
Senator Frank McGowan. Judge J. D. H.
Chamberlain and Dr. \V. 11. Wallace testi
fied to tiie former good behavior and repute
of Gardner, Messrs. Chamberlain and Wal
lace givkis testimony to the same effect in j
favor of Middleniiss.
Kirch wey. tne Branch House night
clerk, was again placed on the stand. He
had with him two hooks, which he sub
mitted to the examination of counsel as
registers of the Market-street hostelry.
After much examination no names resem
bling those of the defendants were found,
save one registry of a man named "Welch,
who hail taken a room wit>b one Perry.
When asked whether guests at the estab
lishment, when asked for their names,
were in the habit of telling the clerk to
"put down any name," the witness
responded in tlie negative.
L. C. Worthington, head janitor of the
Wlil.CII.
Ingleside track, was next subjected to ex
amination. When confronted with the
three defendants he said fie could partially
recognize Welch, but neither of the others.
He happened to refer to the hat worn by
the man to whom he had made reference.
"Is this the hat?" asked Mr. Mogan dra
matically, waving aloft a very battered
[men of masculine headgear.
"We object." cried Messrs. Gesford, To
bin, Gleason and Ashe with line quartet
effect.
â¢ "The hat is certainly most objection
able," agreed his Honor, "and for that
, very reason does not merit the distinction
! of being made a bone of contention and an
1 apple of discord. Let the witness describe
the man's hat in his own way."
Mr. Worthington then proceeded amid
; a labyrinth of questions from the attor
i neys to solemnly swear that the man's hat
â¢ seemed to be a stiff derby, though it might
have been a slouch. Itscolor, he thought,
was black, though, perhaps, it was brown,
and anyhow h>> wasn't going to swear to a
tiling he wasn't sure of.
A. W. Turpin, manager of the Market
street lodging-house already referred to,
said that the man Webster had taken up
his abode in that caravansary on the Ist
of October, 1895, and had remained there
eve- since. He could not tell the man's
baptismal name nor give his initials.
When asked by Mr. Gesford whether he
knew anything about, the case on trial, he
answered, "No; I don't know nor I don't
want to know," and left the witness-stand
without delay.
John F. Bronner, clerk of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club, gave some interesting
and important testimony. He stated that
he had b?en with Ken ben Clarke, the
cashier, at the Ingleside track on Christ
mas day, and had gone with him to the
car after the day's work was over, intend
ing to return to town with him. The car
had only gone a short distance when he
heard a voice cry, "Stop the car," after
winch he heard a shot, followed by two
others in rapid succession. He seized the
batr in which Clarke had placed the
bar receipts for the day and en
deavored to hide it. He ' was about
to throw it under the car or away amid
the brush behind the track, at the time
the second shot was fired. Some one used
a vile epithet and cried, "Drop that bag."
The witness clung to the ban ot money,
and then the third shot grazed his hand
and hit Clarke in one ot his feet. He
cropped the bag and bound up Clarke's
wounded foot, after which he accompanied
him to town and placed him in the hospi
tal . at which he is now being treated.
On cross-examination Mr. Bronner stated
that the man who fired the shots was tall
and had the lower half of his face con
cealed by a white handkerchief. He last
saw the man going over the hill toward
tho ocean, the long skirts of his black
mackintosh Mopping in the wind and the
money-bag clutched in his hand.
Mr. Mogan here requested leave to intro
duce the bag in evidence.
Mr. Gesford objected, unless the bag and
its contents could be first examined.
Accordingly the etout leather pouch,
with its steel rings, stout, straps and tight
little padlock, was submitted to the in
spection of the court. From a Ion?,
jagged aperture in one side were taken
nine canvas bags containing money, one
similar bag in an empty condition, a
cbamois-skin purse containing gold coin
and a number of tickets and papers. The
total amount of money in th<' pouch, con
si- ting of gold, silver, nickel and green
backs, was $Wo 15. The pouch and its
contents bed evidently been subjected to
the action of salt water.
On !;eintr cross-examined by Mr. Ges
ford, Mr. Bronner siiid he could not swear
1 that the mask used by the man who car
-1 ried the rifle was a handkerchief. It
! might have been a napkin or any other
i piece of white cloth.
Henry J. McCreedy, the motorman on
the car on which Clarke and Bronner were
I at the time of the robbery, testified that
he had left the termini s near the track at
I 6:48 o'clock on Christmas evening. The
I attack had taken place at a point about
100 yards lrom the terminus. By the
; gleam from the headlight of the car he
| had seen a tall man with a white mask
| and carrying a gun. The man wag be
! tween the rails walking in the direction of
I the advancing car.
"The man called, ' Stop the car,'" con
tinued the witness, "and tnen fired his
lirst snot. I stopped, and the man went
round to the side of the car, and 1 heard
two more shot*. Mr. Clarke cried out, 'I
ambit,' alter the last one. I did not see
who ;took the sack, and only noticed one
man, the masked man with the gun."
"I guess you were a bit excited," re
warkeil Mr. Mogan, commiseratingiv.
"Well, I dian't feel very comfortable,"
answered the witness as lie ieft tbe stand.
A. K. Trenlet, the conductor on the car]
corroborated the motorman's testimony.
He hud heard some one shout. "The sack
is inside, 11 and had heard the three shots
fired. The man with the gun and mask
seemed to give the commands to some
others, but who they were and how many
he could not positively state.
"Now, Mr. Treulct," said Mr. Gesford,
witli a most engaging smile, "you were a
little scared at the time of the hold-np,
were you not?"
"I felt like any man would feel under
the circumstances." responded the witness,
somewhat nettled ; "I'm sure no one likes
to hear bullets flying about his ears."
"Quite right, quite right," was the pol
ished Gesford's suave rejoinder. "Now
tell me, please, what was the mask worn
by the man who seemed to manage this
interesting little affair?"
"It was a white handkerchief," answered
the conductor.
"Now, are you sure it was a handker
chief ?" asked" Mr. Gesford, with a sweet
ness in his tone which seemed even dan
gerously bewitching. "May it not have
Deen a" table napkin, or a dishcloth, or a
piece of asbestos tissue? Asbestos, you
know," he added by way of explanation,
"is fireproof."
"It may have been bullet-proof for all 1
know," was the witness' rejoinder.
"Just one question more," pursued Mr.
Gesford, blandly. "Did this man with the
handkerchief, or napkin, or asbestos tissue
âdid he, I say, act like a real, genuine,
old-time robber?"
"I never saw a robber before," answered
the conductor. "I don't know how tney
act, and I don't want to know."
E. Willis, engineer at the Olympic Salt
Water Pumping \Vorus. on "the ocean
beach, was next Jasked to testify. After
giving a full description of the plant under
his charge lie stated that he had found the
bag of money â which he identifiedâ on
the sands, about 120 feet out from the be
ginning of tne iron pier attached to the
MIDDLEMISS.
works. It was lightly covered with sand,
and he first saw the strap. He pulled it
out, and, taking it to the works, played
the hose upon it in order to remove the
sand and gravel with which it was filled.
The cut had beerf made at some previous
time, and through it the sand had found
an entrance into the inside of the pouch.
Having cleansed his rind he telephoned
for the police. Officers Cody nnd Gibson
responded to his call, and with them he
counted the money and gave the pouch
into the law's safe-keeping.
On cross-examination Mr. Willis said he
found the pouch on the morning after
Christmas about 8 or S:3O o'clock.
â¢'Why did yo-.i notify the police?" asked
Mr. Mogan. "Not many men would have
done that."
"Perhaps he thought Santa Claus didn't
intend the sack for him," answered Judge
Low in the witness' stead, as he adjourned
further proceedings until 1:30 o'clock this
afternoon.

A BURGLAR CAPTURED.
William Tacey, Who Looted a Room
on Third Street, Ig In Jail.
William Lacey, a negro, was arrested
last evening by Policeman T. L. Ryan and
detained at the Southern Police station for
a burglary committed on the morning
after Christmas in a lodging-house at 143
Third street.
On the night preceding the burglary
Lacey's companions rented a room in the i
house and admitted the prisoner, who j
climbed to the roof and through a sky- I
light entered the room of James Conmlly. j
During the process of looting the room
Lacey succeeded in waking its occupant,
v.lio raised a cry which attracted the atten- j
tion of the landlord, A. E. Durries.
During the excitement Lacev succeeded â 
in getting into the hallway, but was met!
by Durries and his plucky wife, who i
grappled with him, but the powerful \
negro finally broke away and made his ;
escape to the street, pursued by Durries to
Fourth and Howard streets, where all track !
of him was lofit.
Lacey was not again seen until last
evening, when lie returned to his old j
haunts. He was immediately placed under I
arrest, and later in the evening was iden- ':
tifieu by Durries as the man who com
mitted the burglary.

TWO IMPORTANT RAILWAYS MAY COMBINE
North Pacific Coast and S.
F. and N. P. May Pool
Issues Soon.
STOCK CHANGES HANDS.
Eighteen Thousand Shares Are
Taken by the North
Pacific.
THE SELIGMANS AEE WILLING.
All the Local Stockholders Anxious
for a Combination and
Better Rates.
One ot the possibilities of the near future
is the combining of the San Francisco and
North Pacific Railway with the North
Pacific Coast (narrow gauge).
Since the present owners of the San
Francisco and North Pacific road gained
possession of the road there has been talk
of a probable combination. The stock
holders were in favor of such a coalition of
interests, and those who had a say in the
control of the narrow gauge were under
stood to be acquiescent in their feeling.
But nothing came of the talk. Many of
the stocKholders saw a great advantage in
such a combination, but the powers that
be had control.
The stockholders of the narrow gauge
were of the same opinion, but everything
depended on tho action of the controlling
interest of the other road.
Now it is possible for the North
Pacific Coast Company to force an issue,
and that issue is likely to be amicable.
The company has gained possession of
18,000 shares of the San Francisco and
North Pacific Railway Company's stock
and that gives a voice in the management
of the road.
The officers of both companies were in
clined to be reticent when questioned yes
terday afternoon. Those of the San
Francisco and North Pacific Company
particularly were destitute of any knowl
edge of the subject.
"Yes, there has been talk, but that is
all," was the first admission. Farther in
quiry, however, elicited the information
tnat something was likely to result in the
way of a pooling of issues.
General Manager Whiting knew noth
ing, so he said, and referred the inquirer
to President Foster. It was the same with
Passenger Agent Ryan. He, like Mr.
WhiUne, looked as though he knew more
than he was at liberty to tell.
"There has been that kind of talk," said
Mr. Foster, "but, for that matter, the com
bination of the two roads has been dis
cussed ever since 1893. Yes, I have heard
the talk recently, but I cannot give you
any definite information. There" is possi
tively no truth in the story that I have
sold "any of my stocx, and as to the Selig
rnan interest I cannot say. Of my own
personal knowledge I could not say
whether they owned 42,000 or 400U shares
of stock. That is something that does not
interest us at all. They may or may not
own that stock.
"As to the effect of a combination of the
two roads I must decline to give an opin
ion. It ruight be advisable or it might
not. I do not care to place myself on
record on that proposition. Yes, I will
admit that something is likely to come of
this talk, though, as I said, I do not kuow
anything about any transfer of stock. I
have not sold any of my stock and I have
no intention of so doing. It is too early
for positive information."
President Stetson of the North Pacific
Coast said : "'There has been talk of a
combine, I know, but as to the result or
outcome 1 know not. This company has
bought 18,000 shares of the San Francisco
and North Pacific Company's stock and
that gives us some considerable say-so in
the company. These 18,000 shares repre
sent several thousand dollars. They are
at present said to be worth $â¢_"> a share. At
that valuation the stock purchased would
amount to about $400,000. The purchasers
of that stock are Alfred Borel <fe Co., De
Guigne, representing the Parrott estate,
Mr. T. Coieman, Scottish-American In
vestment Company, representing Edin
burgh capitalists, and myself."
"It may naturally be inferred," con
tinued Mr. Stetson," that the most
natural outcome of our purchase of the
stock would bea combine. Furthermore I
can say nothing."
Ever since Judge A. P. Overton, An
drew Markham and I. G. Wickersham
bought up a lot of stock of the San Fran
cisco and North Pacific Railway Company
there has been talk of a possible combine.
All of these men are capitalists and have
extensive landed interests in Marin,
Sonoma and Mendocino counties.
Judge A. P. Overtoil is the president of
the Savings Bank of Santa Kosa, and
owns considerable land in the three
counties named. Much of it is along the
line of the San Francisco and North Pa
cific Railroad. He was a close friend of
Peter Donahue, the builder of the road,
and rendered many favors to his son, the
late Coionef Donahue. In fact, Judge
Overton was one of Colonel Donahues
warmest friends and advisers. He had
much to do with the deceased railway
magnate about the extension of the road
to Ukian. The Judge was also instru
mental in getting Audrew Markhain and
Hollis Hitchcock, who died here last Fri
day, in taking up a large block of the
stock.
Mr. Markhain has large lumber claims
and mills lying midway between the broad
and narrow gauge roads in Sonoma
County, and an interest in the road meant
much to him.
Hollis Hitchcock, lately deceased, was
an extensive land-owner in the western
part of Sonoma County, along the line of
the narrow gau?e, and was al-so a stock
holder in the banks with which Overton
and Wickersham are connected. He, too,
was in favor of a combination of the two
roads.
1. G. Wickersham, the other local stock
holder, is at the head of the National Bank
of Petalunia. Though Petaluma has the
advantage of water competition, the San
Francisco and North Pacific does a good
business at that point, but Mr. Wicker
sham is in accord with the views of the
other local stockholdersâ that a combina
tion will result in an increased profit to the
two roai's.
The North Pacific Coast road is an active
competitor for freight transportation with
the San Francisco and North Pacific in the
western part of Sonoma and Mar in coun
ties. Shippers in the first-mentioned
county, between Santa Rosa and the
coast, can take their choice of the two
roads, or haul to Petaluma by team and
ship by water. It is obvious, therefore,
that a combination of the roads would be
advantageous to the stockholders, if not so
to the shipping patrons of the road.
It is also understood that the combining
of the roads, if consummated, will result
in their being joined somewhere between
the terminus of the narrow-gauge at Caza
dero and Heaidsburg or Cloverdale on the
broad-gauge.
"It must be apparent," said President
Stetson, "that the purchase of these 18,000
shares of stock by the North Pacific is not
merely an idle financial fantasy. Of course
there must be something behind it."

William McGreevy was on trial before Judge
BaUrs yesterday ior arson. The charge was

DEATH OF A PIONEER LADY*
Passing Away of t!iÂ« Mother of Mrs.
Winslow Anderson.
Mrs. Julia A. M. Collins, one of the pio
neer ladies of San Francisco, passed away
yesterday at the advanced age of 71 years
and 9 months.
Mrs. Collins, who was a native of New
Bedford, came to this City in the early
fifties in company with her husband,
Savory Wing Collins, who for many years
was the senior member of the pioneer firm
of Collins, Cushman & Co., commission
merchants. Shortly after her arrival she
took an active part in church work and in
assisting many who in tnose days found
themselves in straitened circumstances,
for she was wealthy and was generous and
charitable wiihin tier means. . For a time
Mr. and Mrs. Collins were residents of Ne
vada City in this State. They returned to
San Francisco and Mrs. Collins became a
member of the Third Congregational
Church, was an active worker in the cause
of charity, and there are many benefited
by her liberality who will shed tears when
they learn of Her death. Some time ago
she was taken ill and took to her bed,
from which she never rose, her death oc
curring at the residence of her only daugh
ter, Mrs. Window Andsrson. the wife of
Dr. Winslow Anderson.
Mrs. Collins was a lady of kindly dispo
sition, one who made Iriends of all who
had the pleasure of knowing her, and her
large circle of friends will miss her.
ONLY NINETY DAYS MORE.
The City Hall Dome Must Be
Finished in the Next Three
Months.
A Hecvy Penalty to Be Levied for
Further Delay â Bracing
the Statue.
The Board of City Hall Commissioners
ha 3 given O'Connell & Lewis, who are
building the dome on the hall, Deremptory
notice that that part of the structure must
be finished within ninety days or a pen
alty of $250 for every twenty-four hours
over that time will be exacted.
The contractors have been granted ex
tensions from time to time for several
months past and appeared yesterday with
their customary excuses. Commissioner
Creswell vigorously opposed the ninety
days' extension asked and moved that
; thirty days only be given and that the
contractors be warned that no further
' delay would be allowed on any considera
tion.
Auditor Broderick counseled forbear
ance, however, and said that he would \
! advocate another ninety days' extension, !
but nothing further.
The Mayor stood with the Auditor, but
Creswell would not give in and called
upon Superintendent of Construction
Mellis to say what had been done recently
to push the work along.
Mellis staled that for two or three weeks
past not more than one or two men had
been at work at a time and that the work
was progressing very slowly.
"Well, times are hard," said the Auditor.
"Give them ninety days more, with a
notice that they shall be required to finish
in that time if the dome fall down."
When ttie vote was taken the Mayor and
Auditor voted in favor of the ninety days'
extension, while Creswell recorded his
vote in the negative.
An intimation that a wrangle might
occur between the contractors and the
artist who is furnishing the statue came
when the matter of bracing the figure was
broached.
The contractors claimed that the worlc
should be done at the artist's expense.
Architect Shea said that he thought the
â work devolved on the contractors, and his
opinion was concurred in by Creswell.
AID FOR THE WEAVERS.
Archbishop Rinrdan Refutes a False
Rumor Regarding the Almshouse
Management.
In their efforts to compass his removal
from the management of the Almshouse
the opponents of Superintendent Weaver
have been circulating reports that Mr.
and Mrs. "Weaver have been taking advan
tage of their positions in the City's refuge
for the poor and needy to attempt to in
fluence the religious beliefs of those under
their charge.
In order to refute the accusation, Mrs.
Weaver recently wrote the following letter
to Archbishop Riordan:
To His Grace Archbishop JZiordcinâ Reverend
.Sir: You will have observed the Dreseut effort
to remove Mr. Weaver from the superin
tendeneyof the city and County Almshouse,
and that one of the assigned causes for his re
moval is my supposed partisanship in the re
ligious services held in tne house. As you
kindly took the time to visit the almshouse in
person, and to investigate tho influences
brought to bear upon the inmates, I take the
liberty of submitting this matter to your judg
ment. Hoping that you may be wilhng to ex
press your opinion as to the religious care of
your people here and the opportunities
afforded to the church in ministering to their
spiritual needs. Very sincerely and respect
fully, Ellen A. Weaver.

GRANGERS' BANK AT TACHED
Ex â¢ Congressman Louttit Sues
on a Certificate of
Deposit.
PARIS KILBURN'S STATEMENT.
He Does Not Think Other Creditors
Have Lost Confidence in
the Institution.
In the present complicated condition of
the affairs of the Grangers' Bank, the suing
: an attachment against the institu
tion, which course was taken by ex-
Coneressman Louttit yesterday, may pre
cipitate a crisis which the bank has been
trying to avoid for some time past.
When the bank closed its doors, through
a lack of business to support it, a meeting
of a majority of the depositors was held
and br agreement reached not to push
matters cut to allow the directors time to
settle its affairs and see whether
an arrangement could not be made
to settle with the depositors in full.
Pursuant .1:1 the directors set
about . ting amounts due the bank
and since the day when the doors closed
$20,000 has been brought in, making with
the amount on band a total of $50,000.
Is was confidently expected that by Jan
uary 14, the date for which the next meet
ing of tliL' board of directors was set,
the $100,000 Â»iue depositors would be on
hand and that on the loth the doors would
be thrown open so that depositors might
get their money.
Mr. Louttit. who held a certificate of de
i'parently did not care to
wait, but began suit for the amount named.
Bank Commissioner Paris Kilburn was
very much surprised when told of the ac
tion taken by Mr. Louttit.
"I ?aw Mr. Louttit a few clays ago, when
he first spoke of instituting a suit," he
said, '-and explained the situation, and
that the directors were hopeful of getting
the amount necessary to settle in full with
depositors by the 14th inst. rie seemeii
ne, as were the other creditors whom
I heard speak of the matters, to give the
directors ;i chance to get the affairs of the
bank into sh^re.
- :ne chances in the directory to take
place at th- meeting set for tne 14th ins%.
were spoken of. and it was honed that if
any we re made it would enable the bant
to rai^e money mort- readily. Of course
the riling of the suit will not help matters
any and may cause some of the other
creditors to become uneasy, but I hardly
think that there is great cause for alaim.
"The bank can settle the matter by giv
inc a bond to cover the amount, or it can
v release the attachment by paying
the $650, as it has ample means at its com
mand. I think that if the depositors will
wail patiently until the 14th inst. their de
ls will be mtt in full."
Mr. Kilburn stated positively that as far
as he knew there was nothing in the sus
pension of the bank beyond what appeared
on the surface, aud that as Daniel Meyer
and other interested parties had showed
their confidence in an ultimate adjustment
of its affairs by counseling a stay of pro
ceedings, he did not see why the confidence
of :he creditors should be lost.
TIME-LIMIT INSURANCE.
Important Appeal in the Federal
Courts in the Phinney
Case.
Mutual Life's Contention That Pre-
miums ShouM Have Been Paid
for the Full Period.
A very important point to insurance
men is involved in an appeal just taken to
the United States Circuit Court of Appeals.
The case is the claim of Mrs. >ellie Phin
ney, executrix of the estate of Guy C.
Phinney of Seattle, Wash., against the
Mutual Life Insurance Company of New
York for a sloo,ooo policy.
Guy C. Phinney was one of the best
known and most reliable business men of
the Pueet Sound metropolis, and built the
Butler block on the corner of Second and
James streets there, one of the first fine
building* to go up after the great fire of
June. 1889. He also owned an extensive
tract of suburban property known as
Green Lake and the electric line which
runs to it.
On September 24, 1890, he took out a
$100,000 policy in the insurance company,
for which he was to pay an annual pre
mium of $3770. A condition of the con
tract between him and the company on its
face obligated a payment of the premium
fora period of twenty yean. Howi
for some reason the company instructed
its agents not to receive a second premium
from Mr. Phinney. though his iirst had
been pa;d and accepted.
Three years after taking out the policy
he died, and his demise was reported by
his widow to the company in due form.
The company refused to pay the insurance,
on the ground that the policy was void, by
reason of the first premium having been
forfeited. Then a suit was brought to col
lect the $100,000, and the jury of the
United States Circuit Court gave a verdict
to the plaintiff of $97,012 84.
It is this verdict which the company
now, as plaintiff in error, is endeavoring
to have 6et aside, and its appeal, the
transcript of which was filed yesterday
With Clerk Frank Monckton, is based upon
a series of exceptions to the conrfs rulings
as to the admission and exclusion of evi
dence, and ltd refusal to instruct the jury
that the twenty years' obligation was a
condition of, and the very essence of, the
contract. The court is charged with error
in sustaining the objections of Mrs. Phin
ney's counsel to the testimony of Dr. J.
B. Eagle-son, the medical examiner, and
F. 8. Sterason, the general agent of the
company ; also the evidence of Ag^nt A. B.
Forbes, who had been instructed by the
company to refuse tte proffer of the
second premium.
If the appellate tribunal decides in favor
of the company it will be equivalent to a
declaration that the obligation of the com
pany to pay the $10u,000 was based entirely
upon the condition of the contract re
quiring tne annual premiums to be r>aid
for the fuil period of twenty years. With
tbis, though, is associated the question of
whether or not the company itself, in re
fusing to accept tne second premium, did
of its own act forfeit the tenders of pre
ininms made to it so long as the life of the
policy-holder continued, and abo the one
of whether or not the company is bound
in equity to make some compensation to â 
the executrix' for tbe confidence and good
faith of her husband.
So far as the present phase of the case
goes, though, the equity of it may not be
reached, as the Court of Appeals will
probably be required only to pass upon the
questions of law involved.
MORE ENGINES FAVORED.
The Fire Department Will Transfer a j
Lot to tbe Police Department.
The Fire Committee of the Board of
Supervisors decided yesterday to favor the
petition of tbe Chief of Police asking that j
steps be taken for the transfer of the Fire !
Department lot on the south side of O'Far
rell street, near Devisadero, to the Police
Department, for the purpose of securing a
location for a new police station.
The same cotuse was taken with a com
munication from the Board of F're Com
missioners recommending tho passage of
an order authorizing the organization of
four steam rire engine companies for relief
and emergency purposes, and the appoint
ments for the same at $140 a month each,
and repealing order No. 2881.
UNIFORMED CALL-BOYS.
The Attendants at the Palace Hotel
Now Clad in Blur, Silver and
Gold.
The entire force of colored callboys at
the Palace Hotel, to the number of thirty,
in the rotunda and on the various floors
above, appeared yesterday in brand-new
uniforms.
The clothes which the force has hitherto
worn have been of a very dark almost
black color. It was uniform for all, but
not so handsome as the new ga-b.
The cloth of the latter is dark blue, the
buttons silver and the braid bespangled
with gold. A line of this gold braid runs
down the trousers legs. The braid also
describes several arcs, parabolas and other
movements on the coats.
Altogether the uniforms are quite an
improvement on the old. They were
evolved by a local tailor on an order given
him by the management some time ago.
On one side of the coat just above trie
chest is the word "Palace" and on the
other "Hotel." The dark skullcaps
liiiherto used on which are the initials
"P. H." are retained.
WOMEN TO ELECTIONEER
Suffrage Associations Will Can
vass the State on Their
Own Account.
W. C. T. U. and Ministers May Not Be
Allowed to Participate in the
Campaign.
Women representing the Amendment
Campaign Association and the State Suf
frage Association met yesterday afternoon
at Golden Gate Hall and discussed plans
for the conversion of California's voters to
a belief in the fairness of woman suffrage
and to the support of a legislative amend
ment enfranchising the womeu of this
State.
It was the consensus of opinion that the
Women's Christian Ttmperance Union
must nor be identiried with the work, for
fear that the greatlaboring classes ana the
liquor element would not give their sup
port to the passage of a measure actively
advocated by an organization that many of
them, from lack of appreciation, have lone
looked upon with disfavor.
Suggestions were made and takÂ»n uo'ier
advisement looking to the enlistment of
some prominent man in the work of can
vassing the State in conjunction with the
extensive lecturing campaign soon to be
started by the Rev. Anna Shaw, who will
visit every county in the State to arouse a
geneial interest in and support for the
amendment. It was intimated that
should a man lecturer be engaged it were
better not to have a minister, so that the
masses of the people might not be deterred
from attending through apprehension of
getting a sermon. A native Californian,
some well-known lawyer or business man
that could embellish his facts with humor
ous touches â such would be, in the
opinion of some of the women, the proper
person to precede or to follow the Rev.
Anna Shaw and attract to the lecture-halls
men that might not be drawn there by a
woman speaker.
The live topics of the day may be taken
up for brief discussion at subsequent
meetings of the two associations, so that
the members may by using such informa
tion in their conversation with nun cause
a greater respect for their appreciation of
current facts, and in that way convince the
actual voters of woman's ability to use the
ballot intelligently.
Encouraging reports from Redlands,
Placerville, Ukiah, Ventura and Santa
Barbara were mentioned as an indication
of the interest felt in the suffrage move
ment.
Mrs. Thompson of Stockton told what
bad already been done in San Joaquin
in behalf of the suffrage question. She
said that she has obtained I'JOO subscribers
fora National paper tuat is to devote a
page Of this month's issue to the subject of
the suffrage movement in California. The
people of ncr neighborhood, she explained,
would be willing listeners to the advocacy
of the passage of the suffrage amendment";
they wait only to be organized in suffrage
associations or clubs, as the W. C. T. V.
has 'itemed it expedient to remain in the
background.
Mrs. Chambers of Yallejo declared that
with a five days' notice Vallejo's largest
hall, accommodating lfiOO people, could be
tilled at 50 cents a head to hear Anna
Shaw on the suffrage question. She added
that the three Yallejo papers, while not
advocates of the movement, had given
very generous notices in their columns.
Mrs. Marshall of Oakland presented the
paper of the afternoon, and her ideas
occasioned various expressions of opinion
as to the best way of broaching the subject
of suffrage and woman's rights.
Discretion and great tact were advocated
by some in mentioning the matter to men.
Others tnought it should be talked about
even though men be bored. But Mrs.
Smith, who expressed some very clear cut
views upon the subject generally and upon
the way men should be approached, said
that all women are not intelligent any
more than ail men are, and the unintelli
gent or unthinking women must be edu
cated to an appreciation of the benefits to
be derived, and then women and tne intel
ligent men should exert their efforts upon
the unenlightened members of the present
voting sex. She also thought women
should begin at home to make their con
verts among their husbands and brothers.
Mrs. Marshall's views were slightly pes
simistic regarding the expression to men
of women's suffrage. She feared that in
many cases through injudicious and per
sistent mention of women's rights the
cause was depreciated in the eyes of the
very persons who have it in their power,
through the ballot, to create or defeat the
institution of woman suffrage in Cali
fornia.
She affirmed tuat women want the
ballot not for the hollow privilege of at
tending the polls, but solely to assist the
deserving of mankind and to put the
honest and worthy in office. She thought
that the Native Sons ought to wi^h to see
Ir school-time companions sharing with
11 the privileges that equal taxation
similar education entitled them to.
>lonel Dickinson of Oakland was pres
tnd discussed th D paper. His tnought
that by a display of familiarity with
ortant current questions women could
convince men of their capacity for
contemplated part they desire to take
tate and municipal elections,
le Rev. Mr. Granam, chaplain of San
ntin prison, will be asked to present
*t the next evening meeting of the associa
tion his paper on Venezuela.
Inspecting Oregon Lines.
W. G. Curtis, engineer of the maintenance of
way department of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, and Assistant Manager N. H. Foster left
last niuht for Portland. They will mane an
inspection oÂ£ the Southern "Pacific lines in
Oregon with a view of improving the con
dition of the road in that Slate.
A Newspaper Mortgage.
A. C. Freese, as special administrator of the
estate of John A. Goldsmith, has brought suit
against F. \V. Kelly, administrator of the estate
of James P. Kerr, late proprietor of the
Breeder and Sportsman, to foreclose a mort
gage upon that paper for $0878.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 8, 1896.
IN THE TREASURY VAULTS.
Ninety-Three Millions on Com
mercial and Fifth
Streets.
THE GEEATER PART SILVER.
Money That Might Be Available to
the Government in Case of
Emergency.
The call for bids for $100,000,000 worth of
bonds, information of which has come in
a dispatch from Washington, naturally
directs public attention to the money or its
equivalent which the United States Gov
ernment now has on hand, particularly in
this City.
In the Sub-Treasury on Commercial
street there is now locked ud in tbe vaults
$40,906,132 63, and in the United States
Mint on Fifth street there is on hand a re
serve of gold and silver bullion and coin
amountine to $52,283,318 69.
Of the' kept in convenient
sacks under combination ani time Jocks
in the impenetrable vaults of the Bub-
Treasnry, which is all coin, $12,117. 000 is in
SACKS OF GOLD IN ONE OF THE VAULTS.
[There is $12,000,000 piled up here in fÂ»O,nQO sacks. The b*xes on the shrives contain
currency.)
gold, a little over ?2"v 000, 000 in silver dol
lars, about $3,000,000 in currency and the
balance in fractional and un-current coin.
The reserve in the Mint is known as the
bullion fund, and consists of: Gold coin
$'2,473,895; silver coin. $30,851*742 71; gold
bullion, $1,225,04352, and silver bullion,
$9,732,637 44.
Putting together the available treasure,
coin and bullion of both the Commercial
street and Fifth-street institutions, there
is a total of $93,188,451 22, which the Gov
ernment might possibly utilize in case of
grave emergency. The $12,000,000 in the
Commercial-street vaults, however, is at
present included in the gold reserve.
Of course, no notice has yet been re
ceived by Campbell B. Berry, the Assist
ant United States Treasurer here, regard
ing the $100,000. 'X)0 bond issue, as there
has not been time enough yet, but he ob
served yesterday that he did not doubt the
truth of the Washington telegrams. He
added in explanation:
I should not be surprised to receive an order
at any time authorizing me to accept bids for
the bonas in conformity with the plan adopted
by the Secretary of the Treasury for their sale.
It seems to me that there should be little
trouble of disposing of the new issue at home,
with the high rate of 4 per cent as an induce
ment. Financiers regard Government bonds
as the very lest kind of an investment and
easily negotiable.
We are at some disadvantage in this city be
cause of our remoteness. Clearances are made
in New York for all points east of the Missis
sippi, and in consequence when we do busi
ness with the East money must be transferred
by exchange. The rate of exenange fluctuates
more or less, and the balance of trade is
against us, as money goes from West to East
instead of from East to Went in bn.-iness. At
present, however, I believe exchange is at
par, so that it ought not to cost anything addi
tional to buy bonds here.
Among several bankers the explanation
was given as to the apparent discrimina
tion against San Francisco that it was
purely a business proposition on the part
of the Government. As President Hell
man of the Nevada Bank put it:
It was simply a matter of business, the Gov
| eniment posing tn the light of a private indi
vidual or corporation, requiring all expenses
to be met in addition to the currant rate of
value bid for the bonds. If 104 was bid by
an investor here the cost of sending the money
to Washington, if any, would have to be paid
in addition.
Were the Government to make an allowance
or discount on subscriptions at this end of the
country it would be more economical to dis
pose of the entire holding in the East, where
the higher rate was obtainable. At present
exchange on the East is at Darâ a circumstance
in favor of local bidders.
Since Mr. Campbell succeeded Colonel
John P. Jackson as Assistant Treasurer
$9,000,000 of gofd has been shipped from
this City to the East by the Government,
which is at a rate of about $500,000 for
every month;
ASHWORTH DEMURS.
He Objects to the Sufficiency and the
Legality of the Accusation
Against Him.
A demurrer to the accusation against
Thomas Ashworth was filed in Judge
Slack's court yesterday. The grounds for
demurrer, as set forth, are technical in
character. It is alleged that the accusa
tion does not state sufficient facts; that it
does not charge wilful or corrupt miscon
duct; that it "does not state the facts con
stituting the offense in ordinary or concise
language, nor in such a manner as to en
able a person of common understanding to
know what is intended"; that no direct
charge is made and that the document is
generally insufficient and defective.
RAILWAY AGEKTS COMBINE.
The Local Men Organizing Under Per
emptory Rules to Maintain Kates.
The railway ticket agents of this City,
having disbandoned their old society, are
industriously endeavoring to come to some
mutual understanding that a new associa
tion may be established at the earliest
possible day.
They field a meeting Sunday afternoon
in the Palace Hotel and took up the dis
cussion of a plan of organization. The
agreement and instructions for local pas
senger associations as formulated by the
Transcontinental Association at Chicago
were read, and a committee consisting of
S. H. Perkins of the Santa Fe, M. >1.
Stern of the Canadian Pacific, and W. D.
Sanborn cf the Burlington was appointed
to draft an agreement suited to local con
ditions.
This comnMttee, however, was given to
understand that the document from the
head representatives in Chicago should
not be mutilated, so that all that could be
donÂ« was to add new sections demanded
by the peculiarities of the local situation.
A report will be presented at a meeting to
bo held immediately.
The agreement from Chicago is observed
by the aeents as a secret communication,
and the most they would say about it was
tl.at it ]>eremptorily prohibited dealing
with brokers, and made the penalty for
reduction of passencer rates a very drastic
measure. Under the new rules it will be
almost impossible for the ticket ageuts to
make a reduction in rates.
STUDIES AT ST. MARY'S.
The Christian Brothers Preparing to
Reopen Their New College.
The Christian Brothers have announced
that they will reopen St. Mary's College in
Oakland to-morrow, when studies will be
resumed in the various collegiate depart
ments.
When studies were discontinued by the
Brothers the doors of old St. Mary's Col
lege in this City closed perhaps for the last
time. Now the handsome building across
the bay is ready to receive students, and
so the faculty and pupils will have a
happy and very comfortable home with
all the latest improvements introduced
after the tire.
With the reopening of the burned col
lege structure the Christian Brothers ex
pect to have ronnd them a largely in
creased attendance of boys and youngr
men, as their many stanch friend's have
given flattering assurances of continued
support. Brother Genebern will be su
perior of the college.
THEY FELL FIVE STORIES
Miraculous Escape of Two Elec
tricians in the Parrott
Building.
j The Rope by Which They Slid Down
Had by Some Means Become
Loosened.
Franfe Griffin and J. J. Marshall, em
ployes of the California Electric Supply
Company, had a narrow escape from
death in the Parrott building on Market
I street yesterday afternoon.
They were employed fixing up the
electric-light fittings in the building and
\ were accustomed to slide down a rope
I from floor to floor. The rope ran over a
pulley at the top of the building and was
made fast at the bottom. By some un
explained means the rope had'become un
fastened, and when they seized hold of it
| on the rifth floor to slide down to the
! first floor they were precipitated to the
| basement. Fortunately they fell upon a
j heap of sand, otherwise they would have
j been dashed to pieces.
They were taken to the Receiving Hos
j pital in an unconscious condition, but
i gradually rallied. Dr. Weil found that
; both were suffering from a sprain of the
j back, and Marshall's lips were cut. No
bones were broken, and the men will soon
be able to return to work.
Gntfin lives at Fifth and Mission streets,
I and Marshall at 2309 Mariposa street.
Marshall had sufficiently recovered last
j night to be taken to his home in tneambu
j lance. Griffin is still in the hospital and
I complains of pains in his back. Both are
I boys about 19 years of age.
In speaking of the accident laÃt night
Griffin said: "We were working on the
I fifth story of the building.and at "the noon
j hour we put on our coats to go to dinner.
We had been in the habit of sliding down
on a rope, which ran from the top to tha
basement in the elevator-well in the center
of the building. It ran through a block
and was fastened at the bottom.
"I caught hold of the rope, crossed my
legs over it to slide down, while Marshall
did the same above me. As we swung off,
to our horror the rope went down with
us. We clung to it desperately, but we
went down at a dreadful speed. There
was a scantling across the well at the first
floor where we used to land and we struck
I against that and bounded up. Then I lost
j consciousness and didn't remember any
thing more till I wns here in the hospital""
Two things saved the boys from instant
death. One was the breaking of their fall
by striking against the BCantJine, which
j fortunately bent with their weight, and
i the other was the fact that the basement
, where they landed was rilled with sand.
1 How the rope became unfastened is so far
| a mystery.
TO ANKTJL A DEED.
Joseph Simon Sues for His Grand-
mothsr'i Property.
Joseph Simon, by his mother, Caroline
Simon, is suing to have set aside a deed
conveying a lot on Montgomery street,
near Pacific, from Sarah Simon, his grand
mother, to Annie Kasmelinski.
Sarah Simon died October 16, 1894. She
! had taken a great fancy to Joseph Simon
| and had him constantly with her. She
' purchased him c!othe9 "and treated him
! always as her favorite. When she died it
| was expected that her property would be
left to the boy, but it was found that she
had died intestate and that the Montgom
ery-street lot had been deeded away
i before her death to the defendant in the
â  suit.
The complaint alleges that the deed was
| secured through undue influence, the old
; lady not being mentally strone before her
death. The court is asked to annul the
j deed.

SPROULE`S EFFORT FAILED
Attempts to Oust the Manufac
turers' Association Sec
retaries.
SMITH WANTS THE PLACE.
The First Outbreak in the Home Indus
try Organization Quietly
Suppressed.
The placid air characteristic of the meet
ings of the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association was broken yesterday by an
attempt on the part of James Sproule, the
seedman, to oust the secretaries and clerks
and place one of his friends in the office
as general manager. This matter had been
brewing for a week or two, but only a
few of the directors knew what was in the
wind, and even when it first came up in
yesterday's meeting several dia not re
alize what was coming.
When the directors met yesterday there
was a remarkably large gathering, nine
out of the eleven directors being present.
Those in attendance were H. T. IScoU,
chairman and president of the association,
James Sproule, \V. F. Bowers, L. R. Mead
(the secretary), M. McGlynn, M. J. Keller,
J. P. Currier, Julian Sountag and K. S.
Moore. The meeting had hardly been
called to order when Mr. Sproule made a
motion to go at once into secret ses
sion, which was promptly voted down
until after the rejru;ar business was trans
acted. Mr. Keller and Mr. Sonntag ex
pressed themselves as opposed to secret
sessions in such organizations. They
advocated acting wisely in open session.
After the routine business was transacted
the reporter-. Assistant Secretary Dingle
and Promoter Tacey retired.
Then it was that Mr. Sprou'e sprung
his plan. He made a ppeech, but what he
said was not reported by the directors
when they adjourned fifteen minutes
later. Some idea, however, may be
gathered of what he said from the tenor
of a letter he wrote to Secretary Mead sev
eral weeks ago, which had been perused
by a number of the members previous to
the meeting. In that letter he wrote:
* * * Without any prejudice whatever to
your good self, for whom I have the greatest
respectâ both personally and in a business
wayâ l must sty, with all possible emphasis,
that I am in favor of a radical change in the
detail management of our association's affairs.
We are languishing, and with the limited time
at your disposal to keep hoid of nutters it is
more necessary now than ever before to resolve
our aflairs into a state of permanent efficiency.
Looking around for a man in whose ability,
energy and foresightedness, in whom I, for
one. could have confidence, I have not been
unable to locate any more suitable man Than
Kmery E. bmith, who, I believe, has been to
see you and quite a number of the directors of
tho association. We need a manager 10 take
full charge of matters under the direction of
the board â a man who will be every hour of
the day on deck with the interests of the asso
ciation solely in mind and in hand.
I shall give the gentleman named such earn
est advocacy as I believe the needs of the asso
ciation andhis elegibility warrant.
Mr. Sproule followed his speech by of
fering a resolution to the effect that a
manager be appointed, who should take
charge of the entire management of the
office and be subject to the direction of the
board of managers, at a salary within the
means of the association.
The combination did not work, for a
substitute offered by Mr. Keller was
adopted providing that the chairman
should appoint a committee of three,
whoso dut3' it should be to review the
work of the association in the past and
look into the efficiency of the present
managers and to recommend plans loot
ing 10 a renewal of the work of the asso
ciation and the carrying out ot the aims
and objects for which it was organized.
On this committee were appointed
Keller, Sproule and Bowers.
So far as could be learned, Mr. Sproule
refrained from using the name of the
gentleman he advocated in his letter.
Emery E. Smith is said to be a personal
friend of Mr. Sproule. He was recently
professor of agriculture at the Leiand
Stanford Jr. University, and upon leaving
liis position decided that he would like to
steer the association's ship through the
troubled sea of commercial uncertainty.
Mr. Sproule's efforts so far to put the pro
fessor in command have failed.
Back of all this there is said to be another
motive for discontent which extends far
back of Mr. Sproule. The association was
organized for the purpose of encouraging
home manufactures and home industries.
The very interests of the association are
said to be in conflict with the personal in
terests of some of the members who, it is
broadly hinted, handle Eastern - made
goods. Secretary Mead is not at the asso
ciation office much of the time, and the
duties and responsibilities of the position
fall upon the assistant secretary, F. 11.
Dingle. The latter has hewed to the line
upon the subject of patronizing home in
dustries, and the chips have evidently
dropped upon some one's toes where
they hurt. Letters have been sent to
many public and private institutions in
the name of the secretary demanding that
home products be used, which rumor
states conflicted with the individual inter
ests of members of the association.
In several instances the writer of the
letters has been sharply criticized for
writing too freely and without a proper
understanding of the subjects contained
therein. In nearly every instance his ac
tions were sustained b3* a majority of the
board of directors.
The thought has been expressed that by
removing Mead, Dingle and Tacey and
putting Professor Smith in as general
manager the latter couid steer clear of
some of the rocks that are hidden from
public view below the surface.
Whatever may be the true inwardness of
the whole affair, there is one thing that is
regarded as certain. That is that the ap
pointment of the committee will have the
effect of putting every member on his
mettle to throw more vieor into the asso
ciation. It is believed that a general over
hauling of the work done will suggest new
lines upon which the association can
branch out in the interest of promoting
and fostering home industries.
THREE MILLION DOLLARS
Deed of Trust of the Los Angeles Rail
way Company Properly
Executed.
The deed of trust of the Los Angeles
Railway Company, which represents se
curities to the value of $3,000,000, nas been
executed in due form and recorded. All
the holders of stocks and bonds pooled
their holdings in the Bank of California
and will now receive new securities in ex
change for the old. The Savings and Loan
Society, Borel & Co., the Risdon Iron
Works, the People's Home Savings Bank
and various other institutions are inter
ested.
It is said that the new securities are
more valuable than the old, which means
that the reorganization has been success
fully effected.
POLICE UNIFORMS.
The Hack and Sick Inspectors Must
Couform to the Kules.
Since the new order regarding the wear
ing of uniforms by the members of the
Police Department when on duty went
into effect some months ago, it has been
rigidly enforced except in three instances.
Sergeant T. Bethel (the sick inspector),
Sergeant Cornelius Martin (the hack in
spector) ana Policeman Owen Gorman
(his assistant) have been accorded the
privilege of wearing citizens' clothes when
on duty, but yesterday they were notified
that they must in future wear their
uniforms.
Mounted patrolmen have also been ac
corded the privilege of wearing caps while
on duty, but yesterday they were notified
that in fnture'they must wear helmets the
same as other patrolmen.
TAINTED MEAT SEIZED.
Market Inspector Davis Makes a Big
Haul in Chinatown.
Market Inspector Ben Davis made a big
seizure of tainted meat in Chinatown yes
terday, and as a consequence warrants
will be sworn out for the offending Chinese
butchers to-day.
In his rounds Davis visited the estab
lishment of Duck Hing at 746 Washington
street and was rewarded by finding 300
pounds of veal which had reached a condi
tion that made it entirely unfit for human
consumption.
Davis'saturated the meat with coal oil
so that the Chinese could not possibly use
it again. He was afraid they might follow
the wa-on with the meat and regain pos
session of it.
The Inspector and his deputy then went
to the shop of Lee Sung, 10^ Fish alley,
and 3eized twenty-five pounds of diseased
meat, which they threw into the street
and saturated with coal oil. By this time
an immense crowd, chierly Chinese, had
gathered, and the Chinatown fquad think
ing there was a riot rushed to the scene
and kept the crowd moving.
Inspector Davis will swear out warrants
this morning for the arrest of Tuck Hing
and Lee Hing, and it is likely they will be
severely dealt with, as it is not long since
they were convicted and lined for the same
offense.
AS TO SCALPED TICKETS.
Federal Judge Morrow Holds
That They Are Good on
the Sea.
The Decision Was in the Gleason Case
Against the Steamer Willam*
ette Valley.
A decision that will greatly Interest
transportation companies was handed
down by United States District Judce
Morrow yesterday, in the admiralty case
of Patrick G. Gleason against the Oregon
Pacific Railroad Company's steamer the
Willamette Valley. Its efffrt is to declare
a scalper's ticket good on salt water.
Gleason sued for $5000 damages for being
refused accommodations on the steamer
on a voyage from Yaquina Bay to this
City in August, 1893. He bad bought a
first-class return ticket at Portland, Or.,
good from Albany, Or., to San Francisco,
purchasing it of a scalper. The original
ticket had been issued to one Charles
Meyers at San Francisco. Gleascn paid
$4 5G for the portion of it which he got.
On the steamer he was allowed cabin
accommodations the first day, hut on the
second day he was ejected from his state
room and" then refused either cabin or
steerage accommodations, being com
pelled to sleep out on the forward deck for
the remainder of the voyage and to go
without food.
The lirst-class fare was $12, and the sec
ond-class fare fS. Gleason offered to com
promise with the purser by putting up $8
for steerage accommodations, but this
tender the purser arbitrarily spurned. In
consequence of having to sleep out in the
open air and being deprived of food, the
plaintiff showed that he bad contracted
sickness, and that he was thereby inca
pacitated lor any kind of labor for some
time, besides being disappointed in his
Midwinter Fair calculations on account of
this sickness.
The purs-er had $240 belonging to Glea
son in his possession, and threatened to
withhold the $12 from this, but Gleason
successfully objected. Subsequently the
company'sagents refused to turn over the
$240 to Gleason, and only after a deal of
trouble diet he succeed in getting his
money returned to him.
Judge Morrow, in his opinion, holds
that the ticket entitled the holder to a
first-class passage with all the accommo
dations as to staterooms and meals it called
for; that there wa3 nothing on its face in
the shape of a contract to show that it was
not transferable ; that the comuany had
received the equivalent for the ticket, and
was under obligation to give proper re
turn, and that Gleason, being the posses
sor of it, was entitled to this return with
out question.
The defense made a very poor show
ing before the court, and contenting itself
with merely denying in toto all the plaint
iff's allegations confined its attention
mostly to attacking the court's jurisdic
tion, a familiar method of righting ad
miralty cases involving an act part of
which has been performed on land and
part on sea. The court demonstrates that
it had full and undivided jurisdiction, as
the act complained of by Gleason and
proved against the steamboat officers oc
curred at sea and therefore within mari
time jurisdiction, and that the sale and
purchase of the ticket had no bearing
whatever upon the question of jurisdic
tion or the merits of the controversy.
The amount claimed by Gleason, how
ever, was not awarded to him. In the
court's judgment ?300 was a proper com
pensation, and this sum was decreed in
his favor.

CARROLL COOK'S DANGER
Judge Wallace Will Have Him
Up on Next Friday
Morning.
TOO MANY QUESTIONS ASKED.
His Honor Objected to Too Long an
Examination and Trouble
Followed.
The case of Frank Ray, charged with
robbery, was the cause of a sensation
before Judge Wallace yesterday, and as a
result Carroll Cook is bending low under
the weight of a contempt charge, for which
he will be sentenced Friday.
The case was progressing slowly, with
the defendant on the stand, when the
court warned Cook that he would not
allow the questions Cook was asking. The
case was taking too long, the court said,
and it did not see the object of the line of
evidence Cook was pursuing. Finally one
question was stopped by Judge Wallace.
"I will not allow that," he said. "I
don't see the object of that question ex
cept to waste time."
Cook was on his feet at once.
"I object to the language of the court,"
he paid. "I take exception to such re
marks made in the presence of the jury."
"You are in contempt, sir," said his
Honor. "You are guilty of contempt of
this court and I order you to appear here
at 12 o'clock."
Cook tried to make some explanation,
but. Judge Wallace would listen to none,
and so the case of Ray proceeded quietly
until 12 o'clock, when the jury was let go
and the contempt case came up.
Immediately upon the retirement of the
jury Judge Wallace proceeded to read the
adjudication of Cook's contempt. Once
more Cook tried to explain, but no expla
nation was allowed. He asked that an
order to show cause be issued upon which
he might be cited, but this, too, was de
nied, and only an order to appear for sen
tence Friday "was allowed in the proceed
ings.
Being in contempt it was not supposed
that Cook had the legal capacity to con
duct Ray's defense in the afternoon, but
he rose from his chair at the opening of
court in the afternoon and asked the
court's permission to proceed. This was
granted and the case went on.
Raj* was accused of robbing Nicholas
Orth of $3. Orth owed him that amount,
and as tbe debt was not paid Ray hunted
for Orth and having stood him up with a
revolver, relieved him of the amount due.
He was arrested on a charge of robbery,
and after a day's trial the jury failed to
agree and was'discbarged.

BRANCH HOUSE,
LOS ANGELES.COLLIS P. HUNTINGTON`S LITTLE BOOMERANG
Kis Divorce of Railroads
and Politics Has
Come Home.
SCATHING AFFIDAVITS.
How the Bonded Indebtedness
Was Swelled by a Cor
ruption Fund.
HE IS VICTORIOUS, HOWEVER.
All Evidence Excepting the Rail
road's Earnings and Expendi
tures Ruled Out.
Six years ago C. P. Huntington cast a
boomerang, and after circling in the air it
landed yesterday at his feet. It was at tne
time that he became president of the
Southern Pacific Railroad of Kentucky,
with headquarters at Fourth and Town-
Bend streets.
He had just stepped into the shoes of
the late Senator Stanford and at the meet
ing of the company's directors declared
that "henceforth the railroad and politics
ATTORNEY â¢ GENERAL FITZGERALD ADDRESSING THE COURT.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
must be divorced." Incidentally he also
said upon that memorable occasion, and
at a subsequent one when he was being
banqueted, that the offices at Fourth and
Townsend streets must not be the Mecca
toward which politicians running for
Poundraaster or better turned their steps
and faces.
Railroad Commissioner La Rue has long
cherished Mr. Huntingdon's lapsus hnguie
and yesterday at the injunction suit
brought by the railroad company against
the Railroud Commissioners to prevent
their making a horizontal reduction of 8
per cent on wheat rates he embodied the
gentleman's salutatory in an affidavit, sub
stantiating numerous other affidavits to
the effect that it was a well-known fact
that for years/ane ot the greatest items of
expense incurred by the railroad company
was the purchase of public officials to
legislate in accordance with the corpora
tion's will.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald and Attor
ney Hayne addressed the court in support
of "the affidavits.
To be sure these affidavit?, or rather the
pointed clauses of them, have so far done
Mr. Huntington little harm. The fact
that they were read iv court before a bril
liant galaxy of le^al gentlemen and a few
reporters cuts little figure, excepting that
they are now food for publication. Other
wise Judge McKenna deemed that they
were inadmissible as evidence, sustaining
the objection to them of Mr. llerrin, the
railroad's chief attorney, that they were
based on "information and belief."
The day's session was exceedingly dry,
the Huntington boomerang and the point
made by Judge McKenna that the reoort
of a Congressional committee could be
ignored in his court, being the only two
enlivening features.
The earnings of the Southern Pacific
Company and its ramifications, however,
were brought to light and are herewith
given: also those interesting portions of
the affidavits read, but stricken out Dy the
:. They read as follows:
Affiants say upon information and belief
. i-reat part of the bonded indebtedness
oi the road was not honestly incurred in the
â¢ on and equipment ot the roads, ana
r the principal nor the Interest on
s a legitimate charge upon the In
conuneroe of this State, and that the
amount of such bonded indebtedness does not
tute a Just basis or criterion for transpor
ts >n charges: and that the capital repre
. the Bhareaof stork is almost wholly
Bctit and for sources of affiants' Informs
a these regards and as evidence of
'i.'ints refer to the report of the Pn,
:i:tlroad Commission, consisting of
â¢ rson, I'aterson and Littler, made
great of the United Btatei. in the
year 1887, and to the evidence taken by said
and the message of the President
ted Btatei in regard to the said re
â  â  fling! of snid commission, a.l
of w . itained in the volumes '1 to 6
tire Beatlon Documents, Firtt
i, Fiftieth Congress."
At thii period of the reading Attorney
objected tn tbe clause of tbe af
fidavit that ft was inadmissible, inasmuch
as it stated no facts as to the bonded in
in'ss of the road and the allegations
v.erp barren of proof.
Attorney Hayne argued that the clause
was prim* facie evidence itself, as it wan
taken from a public document printed
upon the authority of Congress, to wtiicii
it had been transmitted by the President
of the United 8t;t;r ; Â«.
Judge McKenna held that the facts of
the expenses of the road and the debts not
incurred honestly should be admitted in
evidence, &a he believed that acts of a com
mission of - did not suspend the
rules of evidence. He, therefore, sus
tained the objection in all the clause ex
cepting that portion wherein occurred fig
ures, so far as the railroad company was
concerned.
Tnited States District Attorney Foote
demanded that the ruling be likewise made
in behalf of the Government. This was
granted.
Attorney Hayne proceeded to read fig
ures, giving his confreres ample time to
meander about the corridors, smoke their
cigars or cisc quietly doze off into a sooth
ing nap.
Judge McKenna. however, who had de
creed that these figures, take:i from the
New York Financial Chronicle, published
directly from a copy furnished by de
fendants, according to their own affidavit,
were admissible listenea with painful
fortitude. Tne figures of earnings and

j Affiants further say that for a long time past
, it has been and is a matter of common knowl
i edge and notoriety that it has been and is the i
; policy of the Southern Pacific Company and
: the combination of roads which it controls to :
! make the local rates for transportation and
distribution of goods in California to and from
such points as can be reached by water co high
as to be prohibitory in character, so that it has j
i been and is unprofitable to import into Califor
. nia many kinds of goods and merchandise use
ful to the people of the State and distribute !
them throughout the State; that for a long
time past the complainant, by means of the
combination of roads set forth in the bill of
complaint, has had and has a virtual monopoly
of the business Ot the transportation of goods
throughout the State, and that it has lixed the
local rates as aforesaid not for the purpose oi I
legitimate competition, but for the purposes of |
! destroying commerce, by water, in making it
unprofitable to distribute throughout the State
goods brought by water to tho ports of the
.State.
And affiants further say that it is a matter of
common and public notoriety, and affiants, on
; information and belief, say that the complain
ant has for many years past had in its em
ploy a large force of political agents and lob- ;
I bylsts for the purpose of controlling the elec- i
' tions and the actions of the various branches '
! of the State government, and iv that way
, spends, and has for many years past spent
iarge sums of money, which it covers up and
conceals in its accounts in various ways, but
all of which it puts forward as a basis for its
i excessive and oppressive rates.
The bulk of the grain raised in the State is
' raised in the Sacramento and San Joaquin val
i leys, anil is transported from there to points
j on the bay of San i-'rancisco; that practically
I no grain was ever transported over that por
' lion of the Central Pacific which is to the east
j ward of a plf.ee called Roseville, twenty milca
cast of Sacramento, and that the grain which
used to be shipped over its Central Pacific by
way of Marysville nnd Roseville from the Up
per Sacramento Valley, has of recent years
been diverted by the complainant to neighbor
ing branch roads controlled by it; and that
now and for some time past practically no
grain is hauled over the Central Pacific road,
except that which is shipped in the vicinity of
Lodi and J.athrop and intermediate points;
that the grain schedules and rates made by
i the defendants will make but a few dollars dif
ference in the amount of the security claimed
, by tbe United Btatei Government.
And affiants further say on information and
! belief that the said reduction of the rates of
I transportation in the State would soon result
! in a revival of business and of the general
I prosperity and in a great increase In the quan-
I tity of goods and merchandise to be trans
ported over the complainant's lines of road,

; and that complainant nnd the lines of roaO
! which it controls would share in the general
prosperity and would not be injured, bat
woald be benefited in the before-mentioned
action of the Board of Kailroad Commissioners.
And affiants further say upon information
and belief that while it is true that many of
i the rates of the roads forming the oombinatioo
j controlled by the complainant, having been
fixed by some of the previous boar<i> of EUtil
; way Commissioners, yet that by reason of the
j interference of the complainant iv the polities
<>f the Slate a.s aforesaid, and in otherways.it
has been able to control a majority of 'such
boards, and to have such rates tixed to suit
itself and not in the interests of the people of
the Btate of California.

GOT ENGLISH MONEY.
Chafley Brothers to Extend Tlieir Vast
Irrigation Kuterprise at the
Antipodes.
Among the arrivals at the Grand yester
day was James Denman, a wealthy resi
dent of Adelaide, South Australia, who
has been on a trip to England.
Mr. Denman says that the Chaffey broth
ers of California, who a few years ago
began irrigating large areas in South Aus
tralia and Victoria, and who were after
ward seriously handicapped by the hard
times, bad succeeded in raising a lot of
English money.
''They went over to England and floated
a lot of debentures," he said, "and they
now have all the money they need. They
have two colonies. One is Meldura, in
Victoria, and tne other is Renniark, in
South Australia. Both are flourishing in
a very satisfactory way.
"The water for irrigating the lands
comes from the Murray, the only great
river in Australia. The country* about
these towns was a vast desert till the Chaf
fey brothers took hold of this irrigation
enterprise. Now the results arc being seen
in the magniticenr semi-tropical fruits
th.it have been grown.
: 'The Cbaffey brothers are very well
thought of. They could have got all the
money they wanted, too, for the people
were with them, but the banks just at that
time decined to aid the project any more
because of the general lull in business.
Things are improving now, and have been
for some time.
"I think we will have federation in Aus
tralia before lonsr, and one country instead
i >f several. Then we will have aGovernor
j General like Canada. At present we have
protection, which aids us greatly.
"As for Adelaide it has now about 70,000
j people, with 40,000 men within ten miles.
Ihe increase of people to South Australia
| is steady and solid."
Mr. Denman will sail for home on Sat
urday.

A Stockholder's Protest.
Warren Heaton is suing LaFavorita Vineyard
Company to have them prevented from en
forcing an assessment levied October 14, 1895,
and also to have a receiver appointed for the
property and to have it sold and an accounting
made. Heaton alleges that the directors have
been very extravagant in their management
of the company's affairs, and that the $40,000
which it was the wish of the directors to raise
and lor which the stock was ut=sessed, was un
necessary and a useless waste oi money.
DUNDON'S ODD TRAMWAY
The Harbor Commissioners Will
Allow It to Remain for
a Time.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD.
Fruit and Cigar Stands and the Bal
last Men Will Be Moved Off
the Water Front.
It took P. F. Dundon over half an hour
to explain to the Harbor Commissioners
yesterday matters in connection with his
tramway on the seawall. At one time it
looked as though the track would be
ordered torn up, but finally permission
was given for it to remain for a time to
see how it would work. This permission
was only given on the understanding that
Mi. Dundon is to place a warning light
near the derrick and give a bond to in
demnify the commission against any loss
and to defend any damage suits that may
happen in consequence of the tracks
being on the City front.
Chief Engineer Howard C. Holmes re
ported that the track is dangerous to all
who have to do business on the seawall.
In this opinion he was supported by Chief
Whariinger Root.
Mr. Ihmdon was called in and cross
questioned. He apologized for his ap
parent, discourtesy to the board and said it
was all through rush of business. He
admitted having failed to ask for permis
sion at the proper time and offered to
make all the reparation in his power.
A prolonged discussion ensued, in which
Mr. Dun don made a plea for his track and
derrick. President Colnon said:
It just amounts to thisâ it's the opening of
the door, li we grant this privilege others will
want a similar one. It wouldn't surprise me
in the least to see P. B. Cornwall here at the
next meeting asking permission to run tracks
from his lumber-yard to the wharf.
Commissioner Coleâ Oh, the cases are not
similar. Where Cornwall is there is a great
deal of traffic and 1 would never agree to his
laying tracks across the seawall. In Dundon's
case, however, there are not more than a
dozen buggies and wagons pass in a day.
Commissioner chadbourne â I am in favor of
allowing the tracks to remain for the time
being to see whether they are a:i obstruction
or not on condition that Mr. Bundon lile a
bond, as has been suggested.
This the ex-Supervisor agreed to do and
went away only half satisfied.
The question of the new ferry depot came
an again, and President Taylor of the
Risdon Iron Works said he wanted to
come to an understanding with the board.
He said:
My attorney has told me that in view of the
conflict between the attorneys for the board
and the Attorney-General it would not be safe
to go on with the contract. The chances are
that the matter will be carried to the Supreme
Court, and while a decision is being reached
freights may go up and we would lose heavily
on tiie contract. I don't want to say that we
will not take the contract, but I cannot control
the future.
President Oolnr.nâ Then you want to be left
free to accept or decline the contract?
Captain Taylor nodded his head and
said, "That's just it."
President colnon -Well, it seems to me that
the best thine that can be done is to let the
matter stand that way.
Commissioner chadbourneâ lf the board has
to advertise we have the right to reject your
bid, and if freights go up you can repudiate
your contract.
With that understanding Captain Taylor
went: away satisfied.
About a week ago an engine on the belt
road ran into one of McNab & Smith's
wagons and damaged it to the extent of
$<i 7 io. The bill was sent to the board but
it was rejected on the testimony of Yard
master Goodrich, who said the "driver was
to blame.
President Colnon moved that all the
buildings on the water front not absolutely
necessary for the convenience of commerce
be removed. This will include all the
cigar booths and fruitsiands, the ballast
and brick men and a number of others.
Commissioner Cole â I am much opposed to
jpuch an order unless the ballast men are al
owed to remain, or e\eÂ°. that everybody, in
cludhig the boatmen, be removed.
Commissioner Chadbournoâ East street is not
yet buiit up, and if I was the owner of prop
erty on the west side I would certainly object
to having an opposition that pays no rent
working against me on state property. If these
people want to do business let them move
across the street.
Commissioner Coleâ lf the boatmen are al
lowed to stay I think the bfillast men should
also stay. Both oi them are connected with
the shipping interests of the port.
Commissioner Chad bourneâ Well. I'll second
the president's motion. 1 think ii's a good
move. It is in the direction of removing ob
structions and advertising devices from the
water front and I am in favor of it.
The motion was carried unanimously,
Mr. Cole reserving the riirht to object to
the moving of the ballast-men when the
matter comes up again.
About a month ago the Union Trans
portation Company's Dauntless ran into
Clay-street wharf and damaged it to the
extent of $100. This was only an estimate,
and a bill on that basis was sent to tbe
company. An itemized account was de
manded, which Secretary Keegan was in
structed to furnish. It transpires that tne
transportation company would have been
better off if it had paid the .SIOO, as it cost
a considerable amount more than that to
repair the wharf.
Bids for the removal of 200 feet from the
outer end of Powell-street wharf and the
repairing of the inner end of Howard No.
2 were opened and read, as follows:
Darby, Leydon <fc Co :..... $4077

ALONG THE FRONT.
The Alaska Packers' Association
Will Have Opposition In the Sal-
mon Trade Next Summer.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Walla Walla was delayed twelve hours in
getting in from Puget Sound by a strong
southeast gale which lasted fifty-four
hours. She brought 15G passengers and a
full cargo. The work of discharging will
be rushed and she will get out on schedule
time.
So much freight is offering for the big
steamer Afridi, which is under charter to
the Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company, that her sailing date has had to
be postponed to Friday next at noon. She
will take 2800 tons of flour, and all in all,
she will have fully 5000 in her hold when
she gets away. This is one of the largest
shipments of flour that has ever gone out
of this port. The Afridi will carry no
passengers, as very few Chinese are travel
ing, owing to the fact that their new year
would he over by the time they reached
Hong-Kong.
The California Navigation and Improve
ment Company's Mary Garratt had such a
big load of flour aboard for the Afridi that
she stuck in the mud on her way down
from Stockton and wa3 several hours late
in getting in.
The Pacific Steam Whaling Company is
preparing to compete with the Alaska
Packers' Association next summer. In
consequence they will build a cannery in
Hunter Bay, Prince Edwards Sound, and
another at Chilcat. They have also pur
chased the steamer Golden Gate and are
now repairing her at Alameaa Point. She
will be sent to Hunter Bay and will be
used as a tender for the canneries.
The steamer Colon of the Pacific Mail
line sails for Panama and way ports to
day. She is crowded with freight, having
over 2000 tons aboard.
The British ship Largiemore, which left
here on August 2a last, has had very hard
luck. On December '24 last she went
ashore at Falmouth, but was got off unin
jured. Yesterday she went ashore at Vil
ioth and is now reported as being high and
dry at low water.
The ship Kenilworth arrived last night,
havinsr sailed from New York August Hi.
IMS. Bhe reports that January f!, thirty
miles west of the Farallones, she spoke
the ships Edward O'Brien and W. I.
Grace from New York, and seven other
deep-water vessels bound for this port.
MADE A NEAT STAKE.
Feter Negro Cleans Up 850,000 in
Cash From the Amarilla, in
Minas Prietag.
Peter Negro, owner of important gold
properties at Minas Prietas, Sonora, who
fifteen years ago worked in the Butte mine,
Sierra County, is at the Baldwin.
Mr. Negro, after leaving here, went to
Colorado and Arizona, where he remained
some years, finally removing to Minus
Prietas, which is forty-three miles from
Hermosillo and seventy-five miles from
Ouaymas. The nearest railroad point is
Torres, fifteen miles away, on the Sonora
Railroad.
The wandering miner has been lucky
since he went away, so he says. He dis
covered the famous Amarilla mine, which
ho and those who became partners with
him afterward sold for $155,000. Mr.
Negro's share was $50,000.
Howell Hind, who often comes to the
City, was the purchaser.
Mr. Negro says the mine has developed
enormous quartz veins lately, and that,
with the adjoining properties which Mr. !
Hind has, it is no trouble at all to get out !
$1,00 ',000 most any time. The Amarilla is i
a steady producer "the gold coming regu
larly to Wells, Fargo & Co. here.
"I discovered the mine and am very
proud of it," he said. "It is an enormous
property and its owner now will make a
very large additional fortune. As for my
self, I have four mines now which I am
working steadily. I have a combination
THE LATE JOHN >V. COLE.MAN.
[From a photograph.]
of seventeen properties lately formed in
one company.
"The vein? in the Minas Prietas district
are very large and in the main rich. A
good deal of San Francisco capital is in
vested there. Most of those who have in
vested are doing well. The climate is
pretty good there and work can go along
through the year without interruption.
"The Amarilla mine produced nearlj
$1,000,000 last year with only a 20-stamp
mill. It will do vastly better this year.
There are a number of other mines there
that are paying handsome dividends."
Mr. Negro will be here a couple of weeks.

Been Unaccounted For.
Attorney George Perry, for Max Shirpser,
the jeweler, began a suit in the Justices'
Court yesterday against Joseph E. Sham,

DEATH OF J. W. COLEMAN.
The Millionaire Succumbed to
a Stroke of Paraly
sis.
ACTIVE CAREER IN CALIFORNIA
He Was Largely Identified With Tele
graph, Mining and Railroad
Enterprises.
John W. Coleman, a millionaire capital
ist and active business man of San Fran
cisco, expired from a stroke of paralysis at
his City residence, 1822 Sacramento street,
yesterday morning at 5 o'clock. He had
complained of not feeling well for several
days, but Monday he thought he was
much better and went out on the sidewalk
for exercise.
Johu W. Coleman was born in Woodford
County, Ky., in 1832. He came West early
in life, stopping at Independence, Mo.,
where he iound employment as a clerk.
He came to California in 1854, arriving in
Placerville in November of that year. Sub-
sequently he went to Sacramento and be
came an employe of the Alta Telegraph
Company. In 1860 he became manager at
Sacramento of the California State Tele
graph Company. In 1865 he and Jesse 8.
Wall took the contract to construct a tele
graph line from San Francisco to Salt
Lake, and each cleared considerable money
in the enterprise. Mr. Coleiuan was an
expert operator and became thoroughly
familiar with the work of constructing
telegraph lines.
In 1872, when the San Francisco Stock
I and Exchange i?oard was established, Mr
I Coleman became a partner with Henry
i Williams in the firm of James R. Keene tt
| Co. The partnership was successful and
i when the firm dissolved each member had
a large balance to his credit.
Retiring from active speculation in min
ing stocks, Mr. Coleman purchased a con-
I trolling interest in the San Francisco and
I North Pacific Coast Railroad â the narrow-
I gauge line known then as the Latham
road. He became president of the com
pany and managed the road with a fair de-
I gree of success until he sold his interests
some six years ago to J. B. Stetson and
others.
Mr. Coleman was recently elected presi
dent of the Oakland Gaslight Company, to
lill the vacancy caused by the death of
Joseph (1. Kastland. He wag also vice
president and director of the San Fran
cisco and San .loaquin Coal Company, a
director of the Sate Deposit Company and
of the People's Home Savings Bank."
A meeting of the board of trustees of the
Safe Deposit Company was neld Tuesday,
and tributes of respect to the memory "of
Mr. Coleman and resolutions extending
condolence to his family were adopted.
Henry Meiram of the Safe Deposit Com
pany, who was very intimately acquainted
with Mr. Coleman, attended "the meeting.
John W. Coleman served two terms as
; president of the San Francisco Stock and
! Kxchange Hoard, ana that institution ad
! journed yesterday in respect to his mem
ory. He was also a well-known member
of the Pacific Union Club.
The house at 18i'2 Sacramento street,
where Mr. Coleman expired, was leased
only for the winter. Tlie Coleman family
residence in Oakland, where the body was
conveyed yesterday morning, is one of the
finest homes in Alameda County.
In 1861 Mr. Coleman was married at Sac
ramento to Miss Julia M. Pearson. Colonel
James (ramble, ex-manager of the West
ern Union Telegraph Company in this
City, married a sister of Miss .Pearson. Mr.
Coleman's family consisted of lii 3 wife, his
daughtar Jessie and his son Harry. The
sudden death was a great shock to the
iamil3 T .
Queen Victoria is in possession of a curi

Scenes from the Queen's life are depicted

TELLS HER STORY ON THE WITNESS-STAND
Mrs. Davidson's Severe Ar
raignment of the Rev.
Dr. Brown.
MISS MATTIES LETTERS.
They Reveal a Strange Story
of Love, Deception and
Perfidy.
MRS. TUNNELL IS LOCATED.
Dr. Brown and Miss Overman Silent
Mrs. Cooper Convinced of the
Pastor's Guilt.
Incited by curiosity and inspired by a
desire to hear all the details of an alleged
crime, a tremendous crowd was present
when Judee Campbell resumed the exam
ination of Mrs. Mary H. Davidson, charged
with extortion, yesterday.
It was nearly 2 o'clock when court con
vened, but long before that time the room
was packed to the doors, hundreds setk
ing entrance in vain. There was a large
number of ladies in attendance, many of
whom were willing to undergo the discom
fort of "standing room only" if they could
but hear the interesting proceedings.
Dr. Brown, for the first time since the
c.t-- opened, was absent. It was given out
that he had not fully recovered from the
trying ordeal of last Saturday. Mrs. Brown
v.;>? present, however, ~nu occupied a seat
just in the rear of her husband's counsel,
Messrs. Lloyd and Louderback.
She looked pale and careworn, the lines
under her eyes showing plainly that she
felt the embarrassing position in which
the defendant's startling accusations had
placed her and those closest to her heart.
Calna, cold anci as motionless as a statue
â .; throughout the entire afternoon,
evincing not the. slightest concern or in
terest in the terrible story related by Mrs.
Davidson. At times when Attorney Lloyd
objected to the introduction of certain
testimony, her eyes flashed a look of in
terest at the Judge â more of a mute ap
peal than an absolute interest in the
charges themselves.
Deacon Haskeii was an interested spec
tator during the hearing, as was also Dr.
Mackenzie. Among others present were
ex-Judge Toohy, Leo Costelio. Mrs. Judge
Campbell. Mrs. Spencer, Tom Graham
and John rioey.
The feature of the day's proceedings
came when the defense introduced in
evidence the daybook of Mrs. Davidson,
showing that a sale of a corset had been
made to Mrs. J. E. Badden prior to No
vember 21.
The prosecution was dumfounded at
this unexpected evidence of this very mys
terious woman. Attorney Lloyd took the
book, gave it long and careful scrutiny,
and then, without a word, passed it in as
part of defendant's exhibit.
This little episode, small in itself, cre
ated a decided sensation. It proved, in a
measure, the existence of Mrs. Baddin,
and ttiat is a point which has not been
conceded heretofore.
Mrs. Davidson, in her statement, told
substantially all that has been published
in Tun Call heretofore. She went more
into details, of course, but on the vrhole
there was practically nothing new. Con
cerning the conversation and alleged con
fession of Dr. Brown she said:
" 'Have you been a guilty man on and
off?' and he said, 'I am obliged to say that
I have.' Then I said: 'And you break
the communion broad and drink the com
munion wine with the people of your
church day after day? Dont you know
that yon have deserved most bitter con
demnation ?'
"The doctor then went on and told me a
long story of his career, and said: 'Miss
Overman is more the sinner than myself,
because she has always had a strong influ
ence over n:e.' 'That does not relieve
you,' I answered, 'of the responsibility of
the crime; again and again you cave
broken the seventh commahdment.'
"We then spoke of Jane Elizabeth Bad
din; of her coming to the meeting when
the $500 was to be paid. To this he Rain,
'Mrs. Davidson, I don't want to see her.' "
There were many lively tilts during the
proceedings between the defendant's coun
sel and Judge Campbell. At one time his
Honor intimated that Mr. Gallagher was
introducing matter, not because he ex
pected to get it in, but simply that it
might go before the public.
Miss Overman's letters to her friend
Mrs. Tunneil an- published this morning.
They shed a new light on the Brown-
Davidson scandal only so far as corrobor
ating the charges of the latter.
Mrs. Tunneil has at last been located.
She left the City last Wednesday, going
direct to Grangeville, Kings County, this
State.
COURT PROCEEDINGS.
Tho Defendant, Mrs. Davidson,
Gives Her Testi
mony.
Although the continuation of the hear
ing of the case of Mrs. A. Davidson,
charged |Witb extorting $500 from Dr.
Brown, was set by Judge Campbell for 1:30
p. m. yesterday, it was 1:50 p. m. before the
ciise was called in the courtroom of Judce
Joachimsen, after the customary helter
skelter procession from the seat of justice
where Judge Campbell holds regular
court.
After the usual admonition by the Judge
to the witnesses present to retire, Mrs.
Davidson was placed on the stand. She
testified that she resided at 225 Geary
street, was born in Banger, Me.; lived
there till she was 8 years oi age, when she
â went with her parents to Buckaport, Me,
and lived there till 1861 ; was married at
the Jatter place to Franklin Pierce in
February, lHsti. Her husband, she con
tinued, was a major during the war and
went to the front. Sue also served the
Union cause by caring for tho sick and
wounded on the field and in the hospitals
during two-thirds of the period of the war.
After the war she returned to F.ucksport.
Her husband died in 1850, and she married
again in 1573. Her second husband's
name was Thomas Roy Davidson.
Then Attorney Gallagher by her testi
mony showed tliat she came to California
two years ago to-morrow, viz. : the 9th of
January, 1894, to attend ttie Midwinter
Fair; that she opened a corset and waist
agency; that she was in the same business
at the time of her arrest and that she has
represented the same manufacturing iirm
for eight years ; that she had at various
times resided at 1029 Ellis street; some
where on California street, the number of
which shevlid not remember; that s!ie had
had her place of bus. ness at 13!) Post street,
over Liebes' furstore, and that she moved
to her last place cf business, 225 Geary
street, the last week in June.
Added interest was at once discovered
on the countenances of all present when
Attorney Gullagher asked :
'"Do you know a Miss Mattie Overman?"
To this came a prompt and firm reply of
"I do, sir."
Her direct examination then continued
as follows:
Gallagherâ When did you first get acquainted
with Mtt tie Overman?
Witnessâ At the meeting at the Mission-street
Church.
Did Mattie Overman at any time occupy the
same rooms with you?
Yes, sir. Subsequent to her return to the

him, knew that she was a bad woman, i want
to show by these statements of hi.; that he per
mitted this woman to teach Sunday-school,
and that he not only failed to object to her so
doing, but offered words of praise for her work.
Objection overruled.
Witnessâ Dr. Brown spoke of the increase of
the class to me, and said that he was very sure

perience and a Christian.

The suddenness of leaving for Tacoma. At
, that seme talkâ |
Objection by the prosecution on the ground
i of immateriality.
Gallagherâ desire to show by the talks
between the defendant and Dr. Brown the

judge whether this conversation relates to the
transactions of the 22dof November. No foun
; dation has been laid for tne question. It is
nl.-o immaterial, v-*' -.<â¢ â  -
Gallagherâ Counsel cannot regulate the way
we intend to introduce our proof. If the other
Bide finds our testimony improper it can have
; it stricken out.
The courtâ But the public should not know
the details that are not. proper to introduce in
the case. To strike it out would not keep it
from the public. I know such question* are
I sometimes asked to bring certain details before
tne public, but I have no suspicion that coun
; sel is endeavoring to do this sort of thing. 1
â  am not trying Dr. Brown, but r waut to en
courage those who have beeri blackmailed to
j come into court and suppress and stamp out
those persons who endeavor to live by black
; mail. This is what I am endeavoring to do.
! Objection Bostaine
Exception taken and noted.
Did you have any conversation with Dr.
Brown on the 21st of November, 1895?
I did.
Where did you have your conversation with
him on that day?
On Thursday night at a qurirter to 8 in my
\ room at 225 Geary street.
What was that conversation?
i 1 said to Dr. Brown: "1 have heard Miss
Mattte Overman make a confession iv which
; she involves you in a scries of tremendous
I sins. Is It true, sir?" He bowed his head and
I said, "It is true." Then I recited to him all
that she told me. She said that on the 24th
I of November, 1894, their last improper mect
| ing took place in a houte on Sixth street,
corner of Bryant. I said, "That involves a
great deal. Dr. Brown." "Too true," he saidl
"But let me tell you, Dr. Brown, as a minister
! of the fjospel, I want you to tell me the truth.
Have you been a guiliy maji on and off?"
' and he said, "I am obligee! to say that I have,"
and I said, "And you Dreak the communion
bread ana drink the communion-wine and are
, you able to come into connection with'the
I people your church day after day? Don't
j you know you have deserved tne most bitter
condemnation?" . He said, "Oh, Mrs. David-
son, will you pray for me?" I said, "God is j
merciful andâ 1 '
Lioydâ No lectures.
\\ itr.essâ The doctor went on and told a very I
long story of his career and said; "As to Miss i
Overman, she is the sinner more than myself, I
because she always had a strong influence on j
me." I said : 'That does not relieve you from ;
the responsibility of this crime. It is murder j
just the rame. Again and again you have !
broken the seventh commandment." We then
spoke of Mrs. Jane Elizabeth Badden and he ;
said: "Do you think Mrs. Badden has told
anybody else?" I said: "She told me she ob- I
tamed the knowledge herself and there was '
one woman besides herself who knew of it." I
Dr. Brown came to me by a previous appoint- i
merit. Mrs. Badden had also been asked to be j
at this meeting and said she would be present ]
if she could come, but she was not present, j
When I told Dr. Brown that she would prob- j
ably be there he said: "Mrs. Davidson, I don't |
want to see Mrs. Badden or any other woman." !
Then he got up to see if any one was listening,
and then said : "I don't want to see Mrs. Bad
den. You have been a mother to me. Mrs. |
Davidson, protect me in this matter if you can |
and I will do my best, as she threatens me." !
I said: "She has threatened you withexposure [
and she may come for money. Shall 1 send j
her to you?" He said: "You do the best to j
protect me and do the best to get me out of it."
That was on Thursday night. On Friday night
about 11 :15 we had a long talk, during which
he constantly recited the story of his crimes.
Objection on the ground of immateriality.
Overruled. I
Witness (continuing)â And he said, "I beg of
you not to bring the woman. The sexton
might see her, Mr. Pike may suspect some
thing. Mrs. Davidson, you have been my
friend all during the past years. Don't desert j
me now, for as true as God is my judge I have i
suffered the very {.angs of hell on account of
the;,*? things." On the next day I started to
Dr. Brown's, and met Mrs. Badden and told
her that Dr. Brown did notâ
Objection on the ground of immateriality.
Gallagherâ Did you tell Dr. Brown you'had
met Mrs. Badden?
Witness â As soon as I came to the office of
Dr. Brown, in the rear of the church, Dr.
Brown said, after looking around, "Now, Mrs.
Davidson, I think that this is a merciful let I
down. I think that my future is precarious. I
I think that thnr woman has it in her power
to wreck my family, myself and my church.
on say thai she is one of three, and that only
one besides know s of this? Do you think she can
haye f told any one else?" I said: "1 think
not. lie said, "You know the woman, and to
prevent exposure 1 leave this matter fully in
your bands, because she is your woman and
works for you. I have decide"d on this: That
1 will make the woman this offer, and J want
you to lay the metier down to her, that if she
does not accept my proposition that the conse
quences will be tearful, as I stated, in the gen
eral wreck of the church, my family and my
pelf. We will nil go down together." lie
wulked his study in distress. He took the pen
and hauled it to me and said, "Will you take
this paper" (taking up tha block of leiter
paper), "r.nd will you write down my proposi
tion? ' He pushed the block toward me. I
took my pen and said, "1 am ready to put
down precisely what you say." 1 wrote, per
haps, two lines, and then said, "This seems
more like dictation. From the way you are
dictating this you will not put your signature
to it. He said, ' The reason that 1 put it this
way is because I mny die atad my heirs would
lmd this paper with my signature and obloquy
wuiud bt> cast on my name. You are my
mother in Christ, and jam certain you will in
mercy write it as I dictate it ti> you." I
said, " Provided you are truly peni
tent. He then said, "Let us pray," and
we prayed, ana when he finished he was
in tears, weeping violently: so I believed he
was repentant. He then said: "Mrs. David
son, you are a messenger of God and you my
mother in 1.-.rael ate going to save me. Take
up your pen." I did not for a moment doubt
his sincfcnty. I wrote precisely what he dic
tated and signed my name. He said: "Now
this a secret between you, Mrs. Badden and
myself. It is a secret between us, and Mrs.
Badden will work for us. If Mrs. Badden
breaks her word I can have her arrested. She
understands tiiat very well, so you are per
fectly >&te so fur as Mrs. Badden is concerned,
and 1 know I am so with you, and the secret
v, huh 1 have entrusted to you of my love lor
Miss Overmnn is snfe and so 1 am as sale as a
baby in its mother's arms. The money will be
ready to pay to Mrs. Badden on Friday." He
took the tmper, placed it in his pocket after
stamping it and said he was going to put it in a
sale down town. He went home with me and
all the way no said : "lam so relieved." He
said he felt so huppy over the termination of
the affair that he was tempted to call a meet
ing of his church and tell them the whole
story and then leave the city to go far away
and seek oblivion. He added: "This is God's
mercy mid I am so thankful that I cannot ex
press my feelings." When I not home he left
me and that was the end of Friday night.
I saw him again .Saturday noon according
to agreement end he gnve me the .fSOO. When
he placed it in my hands he said: "1 have per
fect confidence in you." It was in his own office
that this took place. The first conversation
was in my house. The money I got in his of
fice -Saturday noon, the day after this receipt
was written.
In answer to a question by Judge Campbell
witness said: "Tneconferer.ee when the money
was paid was on Saturday noon at his office. I
wen i there nt liis request and got the money."
Gallagherâ Tell all that occurred on Satur
day.
Witnessâ On Saturday at 7:15 Mrs. Jane
Elizabeth Eadden called at my house and I
handed the money to her.
Did you have any further conversation
after that?
The doctor called at my house about 8
o'clock Saturday evening. He askpd me if I
wouldtakoa little walK with him and I told
him I would.
Where did you walk?
We walked around the square, down Stock
ton, along Post and Powell and in that neigh
borhood. I don't know how many times we
walked around the square and don't know
how long we walked. Djrinpr the walk he
said: "Mrs. Davidson, I feel that I am now a
converter man. I feel that now I begin a new
life. I am weak physically, but I have a
strength spiritually that I never realized lie
fore. I was afraid that you might not feel like
going to church to-morrow, and this is the
principal object of my coming to see you." I
said: "I will go to church to-morrowbecause
I believe In your penitence. Great as your sins
and crimes have been, yet I jud^e you a peni
tent man. I believe the story of your peni
tence." He said: "I want you to pray for me
this night as you have never prayed "before,"
and I prayed for that man as he requested.
Gallagherâ Did you have any conversation on
that Saturday during the walk with Dr. Brown
in referenco to Mrs. Dadden?
No, sir. I don't recall any. Only he said he
! -wrs pleased that this had terminated as it did.
J He also said: "I do nnto t wish to s-ee Mrs. Bad
i den until some time when 1 am able to see her
and talk with her on her soul's salvation."
Did you have any further talk with Dr.
Brown on any occasion subsequently?
Yes, sir.
When was the next?
The next day after Sunday-school he came to
! my class nfter'it was dismissed and I was alone.
He took my hand and said: "Mrs. Davidson, 1
took the liberty of preaching thismorning, and
I have seen several of my people who said to me,
'Dr. Brown, you have preached the most spir
| itual sermon we have ever heard.' Did yon
not notice that I was looking directly at you?"
I said that I had and that 1 was afraid
the people might notice it. He said:
"1 knew you were praying for me, and
words cfti'ne to my lips almost without
effort." After a little while, during which he
expressed himself in a very emphatic way, he
said: ''This evening I shall lecture and trust
that you will appear at the meeting." I said I
would. The subject was "A Pale Horse."
Alter the meeting, Dr. Browu took my hand
I and said: "Mrs. Davidson, this ha* been the
i most precious Sabbath I have ever passed on
earth. I believe I have been forg.ven of God.
My sins I believe are forgiven aud God Las cast
them into my past."
Gallagherâ What part did you take In tha',
meeting?
Objection.
Gallagherâ l want to show that Dr. Brown
thought all she did after that money was ob
tained was proper and right. (To witness)
WhHt did you do?
After the close of the sermon, Dr. Brown
CRlled me below and said it was a very
precious day, and remarked at the meeting:
"We arc always glad to hear from Mrs. David
son."
Did you have any further talks with Dr.
Brown?
Very many.
Where were they. At the church?
At the church and at my house.
Tell us if there were any after the 22d of
November.
I can't give you the date, but it was after
the Ist of December. We had a long talk and
he said that things were brightening. He
said: "Mrs. Davidson, it doe? not make much
difference to me how things go now, because I
shnll be away from San Francisco. I shall co
probably to Brooklyn. N. Y. I have had
two calls, one to a i'ongrecational church in
Brooklyn, with a salary of $4000, and another
to a Presbyterian church in Philadelphia, with
a salary of .S7OOO, and I think I will lake the
latter, for I need to replenish my finances
locause of the drain I have had on them. I
have paid Miss Overman $35 a month on the
same proposition that the $35 is required for
Mrs. Badden. I have had other drains besides,
and then he "
Lloydâ Objection on the ground of immateri
ality. We do not want to hear any of the al
leged intermittent follies of Dr. Brown.
Objection sustained.
Gallagherâ Subsequent to this conversation
at your house.did Dr. Brown call there again?
Yes, sir.
When was that?
He called one noon and gave me $35 for Miss
Overman. The same which he had paid into
my hands before.
Objection on ground of immateriality. Ex
ception noted.
Gallagherâ You say that Dr. Brown came to
your house at noon?
Yes, sir; but I can't tell the exact data. It
wns along about the Ist of December.
Whs anything said by Dr. Brown in relation
to Mrs. Badden or the money to be given to
Mrs. Badden?
He snid Hint in view of his going to leave
San Franciscoâ as he intended to leave, even if
he did not accept either callâ he made that
proposition to pay $35 a month to Mrs. Badden
through me. because lie did not wish to corre
spond with Mrs. Badden or any other strauge
woman, and preferred to send me the money
by checks.
"Gallagherâ Subsequent to that did he call at
your house?
Yes, sir. He came ft number of times.
Do you remember any further discussions of
this subject made at any of these meetings?
I think I got through all that was said about
Mrs. Badden.
Since tliat time have you had many friendly,
pleasant meetings and talks with the doctor?
They were always so. He took my Hand and
always thnnked me.
Have you at any time had any angry talks
with the doctor?
No, sir.
Do you remember the testimony of Dr.
Brown in regard to the time and place when
this contract or receipt was given and the
money paid?
I do.
I understood you to say that this contract
was drawn up on an occasion different from
that on which the money was paid?
The contract was made nnd signed on Fri
day. He put it in an envelope, sealed it, put a
stump on it and said he would deposit it down
town for future reference.
But you had received no money on that oc
casion. You received it the next day. Did
you give that to Mrs. Badden or reserve any
part of it for yourself?
1 only kept S? 15.
Witness then explained that this $15
which she retained was money ahe had
advanced to Mrs. Badden in order to keep
her quiet until an interview could be ar
ranged with Dr. Brown to keep secret the
entire story that Mrs. Badden threatened
to make public. Continuing, witness said:
Mrs. Badden called at my house and wished
to ?ee me. I had callers at' the time and sup
posed she wished to sec me with reference to
her business and asked her to call the next
night. I have not seen her since the 13th of
September. She went into the country and did
not return for a month or two. I had not
seen her from the 13th of September until that
niÃht on the 20th day ot November. On
Wednesday night, when I returned from din
ner, Mrs.:. Badden called at my door. She said:
"You know what I told you in regard to Dr.
Brown, and you know that if that man is ex
posed that K.-rrible results will follow." I then
said to Mrs. Bnriden: "Let us walk out on the
street" ; and she said : "Of course, this is a ter
rible thing" ; and I said: "The best thing to be
done is for you to go with me to Dr. Brown's
office." I thought if she went we would go
together, but thinking it over I thought it
would distress the doctor if she appeared with
me and tried to dissuade her from
going. During our conversation I said:
"Do yon mean what you say?" She said she
did. adding: "I will expose that man or you
will pay me that money." I said: '-Here is
$15. Come to-morrow night and I will en-
deavor to have you meet the doctor at m?
house or in his studio. I don't want this all
over again. It is best for you to meet the
doctor a::d tell him your story." Bhe said she
didn't know whether or not she could come. I
sent word to Dr. Brown, hoping to have
him meet Mrs. Badden at my house. The
doctor came, but I did not "tell him the
woman's story at once. When I did tell him
that he was traced lo that house be acknowl
edged everything and then I told him of the
woman's threat.
Did you menace the doctor in any way ?
Never, never, never.
Did you threaten the doctor In any way In
order to induce him to give up his $500?
Never.
Were you a party in a conspiracy with Mrs.
Badden or any one else to get $500 from Dr.
Brown?
No, sir.
Will youpiease tell what motive you had In
going to Dr. Brown and getting $500 from
him.
It was purely and simply to relieve the poor
man and shield the church. Jeremiah, chap
ter 18, verses 19 and 20, was my guide in the
matter.
You heard the doctor's story here that you
acted as Mrs. Badden's agent. Did you?
I acted as Dr. Brown's agent.
Did you, as a matter of fact, know whether
Dr. .Brown did leave nny money at your house,
$35 a month, for Miss Overman?
Objection on the ground of immateriality
sustained.
When did you say you first met Mrs. Badden?
The first day I met her to know her was on
September 10.
Do you keep a book in which you enter the
business you have with customers?
Yes, sir; I make a record of it In my book
(book handed her, and she picks out a certain
item).
This development was considerable of a sur
prise, apparently, to the prosecution. Attorney
Lloyd studied the entry indicated to him by
Attorney Gallagher long and hard. It referred
to the sale ot a corset mode to Mrs. Badden on
the 10th of September, 1895, and to some prelim
inary transactions with her looking to her act
ing as au agent for Mrs. Davidson iv the eele of
corsets and waists.
Gallagherâ Was that written in by you and
made on the 10th of September, 1595?
Witnessâ Yes, sir.
At your place of business on Geary street?
Gallagher (to cournâ \\> desire to introduce
that in evidence. (To witness)â You say you
met Mrs. Badden first on the 10th and then on
the 13th?
Yes, sir.
Did I understand that on the d.iy Mrs. Bad
den first tn!d you of the knowledge she had
regarding Dr. Brown she bought a corset?
No, sir; she told me about' Dr. Brown on the
13th of September, 1395.
You say that on the 13th of September she
called, and that was the first intimation you
had from her that she knew, anything ab*out
Dr. Brown and Miss Overman, but nothing was
said about a demand for money? Tnat was
when she said bhe was going away to the
country?
Yes sir.
Then you did not see her again till the 20th
of November?
I saw her next on the 20th of November.
Was that the tirst time that she formulated
her demand for money?
She did not at tnat t'iine.
She called again on the 21st?
On the 10th was the first time I saw her
since the 13th of September.
What did she say on the 13th?
She said she had something private to say to
me.
Gallagher (to the prosecution)â Take the
witness.
On the suggestion of Mr. Lloyd of the
| prosecution the cross-examination of the
i witness was postponed until 1 p. m. to
; morrow.
MRS. TUNNELL LOCATED.
The Friend of Mattle Overman In
Hiding: on a Ranch in Kings
County.
Mrs. Tunnell, the missing witness in the
Brown-Davidson blackmailing case, and
the woman who, above all others, except
ing the principals in the affair, knows all
about any clandestine relations that may
have existed between the Rev. Dr. Brown
and Miss Mattie Overman, is said to be in
hiding on a ranch at Grangeville, Kings
County, Cal.
Mrs. Tunnell disappeared from the resi
dence of Dr. Brownat 1703 Geary on the
night of Sunday, December 29. She did
not return to her lodgings at Mrs. Dray's
house, at 1041 Mission street, but went to
Oakland, where she remained for several
days at Mrs. Eaton's at 916 Ninth street.
Mrs. Tunnell, during her stay in Oak
land, wrote to her friend Mrs. Horton, at
216 Eddy street in this City. This was the
last heard of her by any of her San Fran
cisco friends.
In her letter she said she was going to
visit Mrs. Hayes at Grangeville, Kings
County, and that is where she is supposed
to be at present. Mrs. Hayes is a daughter
of Mrs. Horton. Mrs. Tunnell's friends in
this City are, however, still worrying about
her, and for their sake, it is hoped, that she
will soon write to them and thus relieve
their anxiety. They take this means of
saying to her that they can still be found
at the old address.
MRS. THURSTON TALKS.
Denies That She Had a Certain In-
terview With an Examiner
Reporter.
Mrs. Thurston of Oakland i 3 as anxious
to find Mrs. Tunnell as any ambitious de
tective or reporter.
"1 thought at rirst that Mrs. Tunnell
was probably tinding a refuge in the vi
cinity of Dr. Brown's house." she said last
night. "But now I have changed my
mind, although 1 do not think it would be
difficult to find her if those most interested
in the case wanted to produce her. Mrs.
Tunnell is a remarkable woman in many
ways. She is easily influenced, and there
have been times w en 1 have thought that
s e was not particularly strong minded
"I do not think she could be persuaded
to tell her story to everybody, but I am
conhdent that it I should meet her I could
make her tell all she knows. I followed
several clews after the first exposure but
when I became convinced that her ab
sence from the front was the result of a
well-considered scheme to keep out of
sight 1 gave it up, for, although I do not
consider myself dull, I am aware of the
Jact that a woman can hide herself from
me when she has a lot of assistance to
enable her to keep out of sight.
'I noticed this morning that some let
ters were printed, written by Mattie Ove
rman. They bear out in every particular
the story published in Saturday's Call
"There was nothing new about them,
except that they bore Miittin's .signature,
but I think I would rather believe the
word of some of the people to whom sue
told her story than even a letter over ncr
signature. , ..
'â¢I have learned something about tno
manner in which some papers pet their
news. The morning the interview wnn
me appeared in The Call, telling Matue
Overman's story in detail from beginning
to end, the Examiner published two col
umns of stuff purporting to come from me,
and I never told an Examiner reporter a
single word. I saw him and positively de
clined to be interviewed. Next morning
I saw two columns of matter published as
an interview from me, not one wonl ot
which did I otter. Part of the garbled
story was from The Call of the previous
day 'and the rest was imagination so lar
asun interview with me was concerned
"A story was published to-day in which
it was stated I was employing a female
detective to hunt up Mrs. Tunnell. bucli
a statement is absolutely false, as is trie
one that this house has been watched by a
detective for the past week. W hat 1 Uia
say was that the house had been haunted
by reporters, who seemed determined to
make me tell what I did not Know or what
I had given my word not to tell.
"I talked with a man in tne witness
room to-day, who told us that he came
down from Tacoma on the same steamer
with Mrs. Baddin, a widow, and two
children, and, although 1 am a little in
doubt about tne identity of Mrs. Baddin. I
am contident that he was telling tne truth.
He taid he had come forward to tell his
story voluntarily because he thought it
wrong to keep anything quiet. I have for
gotten his name, "but he is a witness in the
cast."
Evangelist Harter, who is conducting
services in a tent on a vacant iot adjoining
the Central Eank, Oakland, lived in Spo
kane.
"I was not personally acquainted with
Miss Overman," said" Mr. Harter last
night, "but I saw her often and heard a
cood deal about her. She kept a dress
making shop in the Temple court, which is
one one of the most respectable parts â  l
town. I heard that i>he was keeping com
pany with what are generally called a
sporty I never saw anything wrong
with "her, and heard nothing definite vi
her behavior, but there was always a lot or
talk. At that time she was not in any
way connected with the church or in the
church work. I think she conducted the
business with her sister. Since I left Bpo
kane I have heard nothing of her till re
cently."
MISS OVERMAN DUMB.
She Declines to Speak of the Dam-
aginc Letters Addressed by
Her to Mrs. Tunnell.
The following letters from Miss Overman
to Mrs. Tunnell contain numerous refer
ences to the relations existing between
the writer and the Rev. Dr. C. O. Brown:
Tacoma, June, '95, 4 r. X.
My Dear Friendâ Your letter arrived this
A. M.. bringing love and hope and spiritual ad
monition, for which I am appreciative, and
trust the worda are not wasted nor yon r pray
tri vain. 1 believe lam in God's hands, but
at present lam in darkness a:. 1 , tossed as a
straw in the wind. 1 Bin, as you imagine,
thinking much and meeting with opp
on every side about going away. I have only
mentioned it to mother, and she calmly re
marked that she thought it would be nice for
me to study kindergarten. I coulu arrange
about studies atter I got there. Now, about
goiiifi: to some other city to pursue my studies.
1 do not agree to tnat, ahd think it would be
best for me to live rigM ther . Do tint fear.
The moth will not finite! atÂ«>,,t the fl
this case. lam prepared to prove my strength
and tee! confident to curry out any plans that
may ue developed.
lam inclined to the kinderrarten Idea. I
should like work among the children and be
lieve it is best to stick to thai plan. Have
not heard from Miss Btoval yet. i suppose
1 :;hall in a short time. I can start at any time
when the way sctins open. Have no fear for
my living. As long as B. lives I shall. I think
he owes me that, and do not feel 1 am doing
wrong in insisting on justice from him. Un
derstand me, dear friend, I consider this my
opportunity for a higher education an J calmly
consider what can be done it I have the will to
do it. I am not angry, but insu.ted and
shamed, and rise above such a spirit, proving
my womanhood in all I do aud say, and 1
hope! Silence and obedience to my wishes
are his only safeguard. I do not fear him at nil.
Now, a change of subject might be pleasinir.
I rejoice exceedingly that your dear son is
again well and more that you are to remain In
California, and 1 hope that they may join you
without much delay. However bad the errors
of your friends may be, may they be brought
some day to realize their terrible coi
ana reform. Last night in a Bible talk with
mother she said that, aftera long and prayer
ful consideration of the subject of future pun
ishment, she had concluded that annihilation
was the reward of each of the wicked. I was
glad she really was so far, and trust that the
future may brine her peccc and rest in God.

oi this a. m. 1 would not go toSiinpson'3 meet
ing this morning, for I thought sure I would
near from you. lam disappointed, of course,
that you could not see B. But 1 believe he
avoids you on purpose, and I will explain why
I think so. The day you left here at sp. M. I
received a letter from Lou tellinsr me of her
interview with B. She said that he seemed al
together changed toward me (I copy her
words), and that he told ber he had a'noble,
pood, dear wife and every one who knew her
knew that to be true. Asked her if I was keep
ing company with any one. She replied: "I
>m surprised that you ask me such a ques
tion." Then she said: "He tried to make me
believe he felt sorry." Then she went on to
say that to be frank with me, she Had good
reasons to believe be regretted everything,
Said she believed there was a great weakness
some pluce.
. Weil, if you can, imagine the blow I received
in the knowledge that my worst fears were
realized. And ><> I have waited report from
you, an.: know by his actions that he wished to
avoid an interview concerning me. Now, you
DO doubt think that I ought with patience to
resign myself to this, siul perhaps be thankful
if he no lon-.. suffers on my account. On the
contiary, my heart is filled with rebellion thai
i should be so played with, theu scorned. And
the end is not yet.
There is a tragedy ahead. My heart is hard,
ened, and he shall pay dearly for the past.
Don tbe alarnud. To put him to the test f im
mediately wrote him for a small sum and he
refused to send it to me. Had I received it 1
should be in Ban Francisco by this time, but I
can arrange otherwise, and will do so. You
have i oken to me about my spiritual change,
which you observed. I will tell you truthfully
that the offense came through him.
Wnen I went to their house I was enjoying
the sweet presence of the Holy Spirit, and as
my memory tties back to the gradual yielding
of myself to his magnetism, I know that 1 lost
thereby that communion which had so filled
my soul. May God forgive him. He has re
pented of the love in Ins heart forme; has
been forgiven In his home, and fancies he is
now pleasiug God and living right before
him: while I, his victim, can take the blow
and keep silent. He only knows one-half of
me. As for that, 1 hardly know myself. I
know that you will grieve at this letter and
pray that I may be softened; but I pray that I
may be used as an instrument to right a
wrong. Oh, think of such men standing be
fore the people, pointing out the right path,
pleading for virtue, equity, righteousness,
posing as models, teaching morals. It makes
me hick, and 1 loathe it with all my heart.
He shall help me constantly in the future
toward an education. That will be the price
oi silence, and J care for no consequences for
myselfâ he has ruined my life; thelast man
has made a toy of me. I expect you will think
me crazy, but I am not; and as [ have no one
to talk to I must open my heart to you. I have
suffered keenly and found no relief. Now I
will tell you what I have considered. I want
very much to study kindergari and I wish
you would go to Mrs. Cooper or Miss Stovul, ou

he will send it; if not, I will try to raise if oth
erwise.
I know that God rules and I fear that lately
I have been in a very rebellious mood, not
a.eain>t him. but against people who are his
'â¢voice." And my heart has hardened toward
mankind, but perhaps I em wrong. There
must always be a war waged in the mud when
the depths are stirred. F. wrote me that she
was greatly annoyed at B. when last she saw
him. That he looked well fine), and he nad

Tacoma, Aug. 1, 1895.
My Dear Friend : I am jii?t now in receipt of
a letter from Lula, which suggests the thought
.of writing to you concerning the future, i Now >
the only reason on earth I am not with you is
lack of funds, as you know. Yesterday I re
ceived a letter from Miss Siovai informing me
that the -position of assistant teacher was still
open for me in the school supported by the
First Congregational Church. Strange that
should have so placed me. She further said
that she spoke to Dr. B. and he highly recom
mended my moral character. Very kind of
him, don't you think? Lula said in her letter
of to-day that when she was there he (B.) was
infatuated with a captain's wife; that she
thought him a cad and had no respect what
ever for him. .
Now I nidge by the papers that things are
warm, for a certain party, aud soon there may
be no fat salary to maintain a figurehead in a
certain society. A few days will determine
the issue, and far as loving some one is con
cerned I would no longer be guilty of such
folly. Can you understand the suffering neces
sary to compel such a speech? I would be
ashamed to weep after I knew it, and gird up
my Joins determined to rise above common
passions and common people who maintain
them. One cannot afford to drift, and we must
K-arn our lessons well before they are learned
at all.
I have thought B. strong and determined to
live true to himself and God first of all. How
I pity him in his weakness, perhaps hereditary
through generations of lustful forefathers,
lone restrained, but by a common law iv the
nature of things betrayed in physical weak
ness. And now I see that lam perhaps one of
ruai>y having a similar experience with him.
And one so constituted will at some period of
lifts betray the weakness which is the test of
strength for them. -â -_?-â¢ *~,-
There is no life in the religious skeleton
called the church. Whoever expects strength
of example from the church militant will rind
their idols clay. It is simply a worldly corpo
ration to teach morals and practice bestiality
as a rulo. The world would be better were
they all laid low. their sins laid bare. Then
money might clothe the needy and feed the
poor, whicn now builds high steeples wherein
to disgrace God and humanity.
Father has just paid me a visit. lam con
fined to my room to-day, not feeling well, and
have much pleasure in thinking I am not ex
pected to do anything but read, write and
sleep. Dollie is at the hospital, I believe I
have told you, and mother went to visit her
there this p. m. I am glad to tell you that
Katie has changed very much in the last two
weeks. She is never cross and is pleasant and
sweet as can be all the time. I cut and
fitted her a pretty cotton dress, and she
made it all, even" to the collar, belt and
putting in and making of sleeves, without so
much as asking me a question. I think her
one of the brightest children in the world.
She got SO per cent average in her examinations
et the close of school. The anticipated vaca
tion difficulties have vanished, you see. Mr. ,
Collins, whom yon have met here, graduated
in the classic course with high honors. He has
the principalship ot the Shelton School in this .
StÃte. Addie and Kose are at American Lake ]
this week with some friends.
--; Now I will return to .my trouble. I don't I
think I can come right awayâ that is, in a few
daysâ to California. I shall await proceedings
there. Just a little while will determine
things. Do not avoid any one on my account
any more, and do not be afraid to speak your
mind in regard to inconstancy, dishonor, etc.
Why need we spare? But I am surprised fit 8.,
kuowing how much he is in my power, that he
would dare to defy me. He certainly must be
out of his mind a little.
Ido not want for money. If you need it go
to him, in my name, and ask for it. Mrs. D.
expects me down to assist her ia the exhibit
this fallâ from the 15th of August to the 15th
of September. I cannot go unless I get my
fare. It should come from 8., but beingabsent ;
I eanrot force matters. At any rate I can
wait; a kindly Providence rules. Right will
in the end reign, and the way will beset be
fore me. â  Â«- . - ... .Mattie. . ...
Miss Mattie Overman v.'hen seen yester
day afternoon at the residence of Rev. 0.
0. Brown appeared very much careworn
and looked like one who had given up all
hope for trie future.
When asked what she desired to say con
cerning; letters which it is claimed were
written by her to Mrs. Tunnell and which
were published yesterday morning her
reply, calm and deliberate, was: "I have
nothing to say about that."
"But do you not see, Miss Overman,"
was suggested, "that these letters place
you before the public in a most unenviable
light?"
"Yes," she replied in the tone of one
forlorn, "but I will not say anything
about the matter. I have not said any
thing:, anyi have nothing whatever to say."
â¢'Then you will neither admit nor
deny?"
'â¢I have nothing whatever to say to the
public on this subject."
"But your silence may be construed into
an admission of the truth of these letters?"
"I repeat," said Miss Overman, "that 1
have nothing to say. T thank The Call
for its courtesy in offering me an oppor
tunity to make a statement, but 1 have
nothing to say, so you will excuse me from
talking furtiier," and with that she re
tired.

Â«. .
BROWN WILL NOT RESIGN.
Mode of Procedure In Case Charges
Are Preferred Against the
Pastor.
D. Gilbert Dexter and Captain W. F.
Cook, deacons of the First Congregational
Church, declined to say anything yester
day about the letters said to have been
written by Miss Mattie 0 verm at), in which
she tells the story of her relations with
Rev. Dr. Brown.
"So far as I know," said Mr. Dexter,
â¢'the Rev. Mr. Brown has not signified his
intention of resigning, and if he had J
think I would know something of it. It is
my belief, from what I know of Mr. Brown,
that he will not resign. So far nothing
has been done in the line of asking Mr.
Brown for his resignation, nor have any
charges been preferred against him.
. "A statement has been published to the
effect that if there should be any inquiry
into this matter or demand for resignation
it would become the duty of the trustees of
the church to attend to that matter. That
i- a niistaKe. The trustees do not have
control of that matter. It belongs to the
standing committee, of which the board of
deacons forms a part.
"The trustees nave only charge of finan
cial matters," said Deacon Cook. "If they
saw tit they might reduce the salary of Mr.
Brown to $1 a year, and he would still be
pastor of the church if he saw fit to accept
that as salary."
"Any member of the congregation," con
tinued Mr. Dexter, "could prefer charges
against the pastor, and these- would be
referred to the standing committee or the
board of deacons, and, if it was determined
that there was any merit In them, the
matter would then be left to the congrega
tion fortriul and determination. The con
gregation could, howerer, have the whole
matter investigated by a special committee.
"The trustees could not dismiss the
pastor, but the standing committee could;
yet, in order to make the action binding,
the trustees would have to concur."
MRS. COOPER IS SAD.
Says That Dr. Brown Should Con
fess and Repent for His
Sin.
Mr.-. Barah B. Cooper, the well-known
philanthropist and Bible teacher, patroness
of the young, and pillar of the First Con
gregational Church, declares that the Rev.
Dr. Brown should confess his sin before
God and resign his pastorate. Mrs. Cooper
said:
Oh, why does be not confess his sin before
God and roan and in repentance begin life
anew? That is the only way ; no other course
is acccDtable in the tight of God.
Dr. Brown has no alternative but to resign.
THE SAS FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 8, 1896,
Why does he not do so and prevent further
probing- into this awful sore? I have
not called upon him, as I felt I should
do, liecuuse I could not offer him words of
encouragement which I have not in mv heart.
Why <ioc-s he not confers his sin before God
and ma <J, and In repentance in some obscuro
place begin life anew?
1 do not know what the church will do in
this matter, for 1 heve not talked with mem
bers concerning it. We will leave it with the
deacons, trusting iv their wisdom and judg
ment to do that which is best for all con
cerned.
This terrible a flair will give the church a set
back from which it will not recover in ten
years. It will be taken up"l>y the enemies of
religion as a cudgel, and while it will not in
jure the cause to a material extent it will nev
ertheless do no good. The First Congregational
church will rise again, and In the years that
are to come will wipe out the stain these
awful events have placed upon it. That eh arch
has lieen my home for years, but last Sunday
it appeared to me asa mausoleum. Words
cannot express the sorrow I have experienced
in tho past few days, filled as they were with
such frightful disclosures.
DR. BROWN IS SILENT.
The Pastor Says Thr.t He Is Acting
Under the Advice of His
Attorney.
The llev. Dr. Brown is silent. He will
not discuss theOverman-Tunnell letters or
any other phase of the great church scan
dal.
Press representatives were denied ad
mittance to the pastor's residence yester
day. Every effort was made to give Dr.
Brown an opportunity to defend himself,
but he refused to make a statement for
publication.
Dr. Brown was called up by telephone
at his residence last night.
"Doctor," said the reporter, "The Call
is willing to publish a statement from you
in this "
"I have nothing to say," interrupted Dr.
Brown.
"Don't you think that you owe it to
your people, that 13 your flock, to make a
public statement of your position?"
"My lawyers will not allow me to speak,"
was the answer.
"It certainly would not injure your po
sition as plaintiff in the case against Mrs.
Davidson to discuss late developments.
Besides, your people were still standing by
you. and" "
"Yes, and they will stand by me, you
can depend on that," replied Dr. Brown
in a hopeful voice.
WILL STAND BY DR. BROWN.
Dr. McLean Will Not Forsake the
Pastor Until He Is Proven
Guilty.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 7.â Rev. J. K.
McLean, D.D., is dean of tlie Congrega
tional ministers of the Pacific Coast, and
for twenty-five years has been pastor of
the First Congregational Church of Oak
land. Some six months ago he resigned
to accept the presidency of the Pa
cific Theological Seminary. His views
regarding what steps may or can be
taken by the church of which Dr. Brown
is pastor will be received with all the
weight that his standing gives it.
"I EmV said he last night, "that I
should stand by Dr. Brown until he is
proven guilty. In our relationship as
Christian men and members of the same
denomination we naturally suppose that
all are what they represent themselves
and are real Christians, equally interested
in seeing the cause advanced. The church,
1 think, should look at it in the same
light. In all my experience as a minister
I have never been where a minister of our
denomination has been tried by the church,
and do not know just what the procedure
would be irom experience.
"However I think that nothing should
be done until the trial now in progress is
completed. If there is evidence brought
out which the members of the. church feel
is inconsistent with the standing of Dr.
Brown as their pastor, any one member
can tile charges and a trial will have to be
held. A court can compel witnesses to
attend and testify. A church inquiry can
not; so it is usually held after the court
trial, and the records of that trial can be
introduced as evidence. In such a case
Dr. Brown would be given due notice of
the trial and a copy of the charge. He
would then be requested to make an an
swer. After a full hearing a verdict would
be rendered for or against him. li it was
against him he would be disfellowshipped.
"In readintr over what has been pub
lished regarding the trouble, I have seen
nothing that is at all criminal charged
against Dr. Brown. At the most it looks
as if he had been guilty of paying marked
attention to women of his congregation.
It is a bad affair at worst, and coming as
it does after the trouble ot that church I
with Rev. Dr. Barrows, is to be greatly
lamented. It is a great blow to Chris
tianity hÂ«re on the coast. Every one who
has a scheme to work comes here, and,
under the cloak of being a Christian
worker, gets a good footing.
"Where the scheme is worked the church
gets all the blame. I do not believe the
church should do anything now until the
present trial ends. As far as I know they
are not arranging for anything at present.
â¢'As far as the CoiiKreKational Club is con
cerned they received his statement a week
ago Monday and indorsed his act to cap
ture the one who was attempting to blacK
mail him. All this other was not known
to us at that time. We shall do nothing
more at present, but await the action of the
courts."

Among the Massachusetts delegation in

bicund nose, a flaring, conspicuous nose, a
real danger signal of a proboscis. Speaker
Crisp, in making up the committees, as
signed MoEttrick to the Committee on Al
coholic Liquor Traffic. There was no design
in it. It just happened so. It was a good
place, whether a man had ji red, showy
nose or a pale, unostentatious one. McEt
trick, at the first favorable opportunity,
hunted up the Speaker.
".Mr. Speaker," said he, "I want to re
quest you to take me off the Committee on
Alcoholic Liquor Traffic."
"Why, Mr. McEttrick?" asked the
Speaker, concentrating his gaze earnestly
upon the nose in front of him.
"Look at my nose, :> said McEttrick, in a
burst of candor; "just look at my nose.'
"Well, I see it," said the Speaker.
â¢'\VÂ»iat's the matter with that nose?"
"What's the matter with that nose?"
asked McEttrick, "what's the matter with
that nose? Did you ever see a nose like
it? If I served on the Committee on Alco
holic Liquor Traffic every street arab in
Boston would guy the life out of me; it
would ruin me with my constituents, and
the reputation of that committee wouldn't
be worth 3 cents on the dollar. No, Mr.
Speaker, a man with a nose like mine has
no business to be sticking it into the Com
mittee on Alcoholic Liquor Trafficâ

PILING IN CHINA BASIN.
San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Road at Work
There.
Large Contracts for More Building
Material Are Let to Californian
Contractors.
The Fan Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railway began building operations
yesterday morning in China Basin. In
stantly there was a stir among Southern
Pacific officials, and as soon as word was
received at the head offices an engineer
was dispatched to the scene with instruc
tions to be careful in his surveys, lest the
competing railway might have encroached
on Southern Pacific territory, which lies
scattered all over the swamp land near
Channel street. He found the Valley,
road workmen driving piles at Fourth and
Kentucky 6treets in the water of China
Basin.
Chief Engineer Storey of tlie Valley
road stated that when the lease of China
Basin was signed a clause stipulating that
work should be started on the basin within
six months was inserted.
"The six months will have expired to
morrow," he continued, "and so we began
work there ahead of time. We are driv
ing piles to support a railroad track out
over the water of the basin."
"How far out?"
"As far as is needed for dumping rock
and earth into the basin for tilling. We
have applied for a franchise along Illinois
street, which comes under conditions sim
ilar to those of the Fresno franchise now
before the Supreme Court for decision.
When that case is decided 1 suppose there
will be no difficulty in the way of a fran
chise on Illinois street. Until then, how
ever, we can't do much in the way of fill
ing China Basin, but once we have the
franchise we can begin to lay tracks and
haul rock from quarries flb build a depot
site."
The directors of the Valley road met yes
terday and awarded some large contracts.
To J.Meyer of San Jose was awarded a
contract for 150,000 redwood ties, and to
O. A. Hooper & Co. of this City 150,000,
both to be delivered as required before No
vember next. These ties are needed for a
short Ptrin of line north of Fresno and the
road to Bakerslield. A contract for fenc
ing the railway from Stockton to the Stan
islaus River with a live-loot fence of lum
ber and barbed wire was given H. L. App
and John A. Hayward of Stockton.
For iron bridgework at Dry Creek to be
used in a 100-foot crossing was contracted
for with the Stockton Agricultural Works,
tne Pacific Rolling Mills and the Pavne
Bolt Works.
The ship Mac Donald arrived a few days
since from New York with 800 tons of
mils for the road and another ship is in
port discharging a cargo of rails on Valley
road barges.
The great bridge acros3 the Stainslaus
River has delayed progress in laying track,
but Mr. Storey stated yesterday that the
piers were finished and ieauy for the
hoisting and placing of the bridge, which
was ready in Stockton. In another
month, he said, the bridpe will have been
completed and then tracklaying will be
poshed south with energy over the graded
roadbed, which is now well on toward the
Tuolumne iliver.
WITHOUT HEING A SHOT.
ludiang Slolted Away J.efore Jforty Men
Whom They EneW to lie Scalp-Takers. I
In the pioneer days to reach Montana
from Cheyenne, in Wyoming, required a
roundabout journey ttiat involved a double
crossing of the Rocky Mountains, with a
ahange of base at Salt Laka City. The
United States Government brought about
a better condition of travel by construct
ing a trail through the Goiiatin Valley
along the course of the Gunpowder River,
reaching ai and the base of the mountains
in a curvilinear form, which avoided the
heights of the Rockies. To protect this
route from marauding Indians three forts
were builtâ Reno. Phil Kearny and C. F.
Smith. These were garrisoned by United
States troops.
In 186G the murderous Sioux from the
Yellowstone Valley pursued a sanguinary
course up through the Gallatin Valley and
into Montana. It was marked by rapine
a:i<i plunder. They besieged Fort Reno
and killed many of its garrison, including
a brother of A. K. McClure. They en
vironed Fort Phil Kearny, and wiped from
the face of the earth every human being
whose walla it failed to protect. Then
they surrounded Fort C. F. Smith, where
200 Union Boldiers found themselves
surrounded by more than 1000 death
seeking Indians. Escape seemed impos
sible. A courier got word of this condition
oi affairs to General Hancock, who was
then stationed at St. Paul, and he sent a
messenger to the Governor of Montana at
Bozemun. calling upon nun to relieve the
besieged garrison. The chief executive of
the Territory of Montana at that time was
Green Clay Smith, who, by the way, re
cently died in Washington, a Baptist cler
gyman. He had been a member of Con
gress from Kentucky, but President
Lincoln made him Territorial Governor of
Montana. He was seated on the porch of
his residence in bozeman when Hancock's
message was handed to him. To a visitor
from the East, who was seated by his side,
and who is authority for this narrative, he
said :
"What in the name of heaven can I do?
Fort C. P. Smith is 250 miles away. The
country between here and there is filled
with bioux Indians. Our militia force
consists of exactly 4*27 men. Not a man of
them could reach Fort C. F. Smith alive.
1 am absolutely powerless. However, I
will send for Colonel Howie. 1 '
At that time Colonel Neil Howie was
United States Marshal for the Territory
of Montana. He was a typical frontiers
man. He commanded the Montana vol
unteers, and it has been said of him that
"General Sherman might have been at
Bo ze in an City with 5000 troops and the
people of Gallatin could not have escaped
the scalping knife of the savage; but Colo
nel Howie, with less than 400 men, pro
tected 100 miles of exposed frontier but a
little distance from the hostile tribes."
It was to this man that Governor Smith
addressed himself, handing him General
Hancock's dispatch, and saying: "Colonel,
we can't do anything for those poor devils
in Fort C. F. Smith. We Jhaven't enough
men, and those we have couldn't get there.
Am I not right?"
"^o," said Colonel Howie;, quietly, with
out any exhibition of excitement and with
the gentle voice of a woman. "There is no
trouble about that, Governor. We can
arrange that matter and still leave the
Montana frontier protected. I will need
some picked men and a good leader for
them. I think Captain McCabe is best
fitted for this undertaking. 1 will go out
and find him."
McCabe was another gentle-voiced man
with blue eyes. He didn't make
much noise. He acted. He said
to the Governor: "Oh, yea; it is
easy enough. But I'll need forty of
the best men I can select. You can keep
the rest of your volunteer force here."
Governor Smith looked at him in amaze
ment. So did the visitor from the fort.
They both thought lie was either insane
or a bruggard. Governor Smith said to
him: ''How do you expect to raise the
siege of Fort C. F. Smith with forty men
when you know that it is sur
rounded with more than 1000 blood
thirsty Indians and that the country
between here and there is covered with
thousands more of murderous Sioux?"
Said McCabe quietly: "Why, Governor,
it is easy enough. The Indians know un,
and know that we know them better than
they know themselves. You folks from
the IÂ£ast have an idea that what you call
Indian atrocities are simply unmeaning
exhibitions of brutality; that scalping, for
instance, is simply a form of torture. In
that you are mistaken. The Indian be
lieves that no man can go to the happy
hunting ground â heaven as we call it â
who has been deprived of his hair. Their
motive in scalping a victim is to carry out
fiendish hatred to its utmost by prevent
ing him from having a happy hereafter.
Therefore, to deprive an Indian of bis
scalp is to rob him of his hope of a happy
hereafter. My men never kill an Indian
without scalping him, and the Indians
know that. The forty men I will select for
this expedition are unerring in their aim
with the rifle. They can shoot sixteen
shots in sixteen seconds, and every ball
means a dead Indian, and every dead In
dian means a scalp, and every scalp means
a warrior deprived eternally of acnance of
ever reaching the nappy hunting ground.
My forty men will walk from here to Fort
0. F. Smith without tiring a shot."
"Incredible," said Governor Smith.
''True." said Captain MoCabe.
What was the result?
Forty men walked the 250 miles from
Bozeman to Fort C. F. Smith. Indians
watched them on every side. By djy
their progress was signaled by cfrcling
columns of smoke and by night by rire
from mountain tops. But not a shot was
fired. When they got within sight of
Fort C. F. Smith the 1000 whooping Sioux
who held the garrison in siege fled, and
the forty frontiersmen from Bozeman
marched in and escorted the 200 Union
soldiers back to the Territorial capital
without the loss of a life. Not a shot had
been iired. Not a scalp had been lifted. â

ELECTRICAL ACCIDENTS.
Instructions Given for the Kescuscita-
tion of Victims.
Means and ways to secure resuscitation
from heavy electric shock have at last
been discovered as a result of investiga
tion by the Academy of Medicine- in this
city. The Academy selected a committee
of electrical experts, and it began its labors
under the presidency of Dr. d'Arsonval,
well known as an authority in all matters
connected with electricity. In his report
Dr. d'Arsonval says that even the victims
of very heavy shocks, as long as the tissues
are not destroyed, may be rescuscitated by
means of artificial respiration. He learned
this fact by numerous experiments, and
the report of a typical accident in which
his method was successfully tried con
firmed all he ever entertained for it.
The doctor continued: My formula for
reviving the victims of electric shock is
â¢Mb; A person so disabled should be
treated like one drowned.
These are the directive rules, which
not only workmen in electrical industries
but every citizen and every friend of
humanity shou.d know by heart :
Above all, break the contact with the con
ductors. If the current can be instantly cut
off, so much the better; if not, lose no time by
telephoning or sending messengers, but apply
yourself directly to the body that must be re
moved.
In doing so touch not the victim on face or
hands or any naked part of his body. You may
try to lift him up by the coattails, or alter
throwing a blanket or coat around him. Mind,
they must be dry. Also remember that dry
wood is a non-conductor. You may use a stick
to uraw the body over tv one side or to hold
back a live wire. To lift the victim on" a cross
bar pass a piece of lumber under his heels and
raise him op. The same should be done if the
body is in contact with the ground. His feet
should be raised from the earth immediately.
Any piece of wood or furniture or elotn will do.
The body should be carried into the open or
a room where air has free access. All not
directly engaged in the work of rescue should
be instantly dismissed from the place. The
body must be placed upon the back after the
shin and collar has been loosened. Raise tne
shoulders and let the head fall back.
Then begin the work of restoring- respira
tion; tnat is, seize both arms and draw tuem
energetically over the head, bringing them
nearly together and holding them in that posi
tion for a couple of seconds. These move
ments having expanded the chest and pressed
air into the lungs, carry the arms down to the
sides and front of the chest, doubling them up
at the elbows, in order to expel the air from
the lungs. Continue in this for at least au
huur, uiiless respiration sets in before.
A seoond Samantau should at the same time
seize the tongue of the victim â it is well to pro
tect one's finger with a piece of cloth or a glove
for this processâ ftctl draw it out while the
arms are extended over the head, allowing it
to recede When the arms are pressed against
the bides of the breast. Both these maneuvers
should be carried on with as little interruption
as possible. Twenty times per minute is not
too much.
If the victim shows a tendency to clinch his
teeth keep them apart by placing a piece' of
wood or anything handy between them.
It is also advised to rub the body with
brushes, brooms and cloth, iv order to promote
the circulation of the blood.
Do not administer stimulants unless a medi
cal person pronounces it safe to do so. When
possible, procure a tank of oxygen gas from the
nearest drugstore, and after improvising a
cone place the tube over the mouth and nosa
while the gas is ishuing. It iÂ» a powerful stiin
uiaut to the heart's action under certain con
dition, and will aid respiration.â Paris letter to
St. Louis Globe- Democrat.
Built by Napoleon.
Among the many things that Napoleno
did for Germany was the construction of a
highway between Hamburg, Bremen and
Heer. Until the beginning of the centuiy
good roads were unknown in that vicinity,
and it was reserved for the French engi
neers to show the Hanoverians and their
neighbors how to improve their highways
by means of the bowlders found on the
plain in which the cities are situated. The
road mentioned is generally straight, and
exists to-day practically as built. It has a
middle-paved way 14^ feet wide, which is
used for heavy teaming. On one side of
this is a broken-stone road 1114 feet wide,
and on the otiier side is a dirt road of equal
width for farm trucking during the sum
mer. Outside the broken-stone road is
a footpath 4 feet wide, and outside the dirt
road is a benching b% feet wide. In repair
ing these and similar roads it became more
and more difficult to secure bowlders, so
slag from blast furnaces was. substituted,
and there are now about 340 miles of slag
roads in the province of Hanover.

NEW YORK, N.Y., Jan. 7.â Speculation at the |
stock exchange was nervous and irregular to-<lay. ]
Business was on a smaller scale, however, the trans
actions amounting to 262.150 shares. There was
an approach to demoia'.ization at the opening,
owing to the lower cables from London. The break
In the active list at this time ranged from y% to
2- : + per cent. Pacific Mall, Big Four, Consolidated
Gas, tne Grangers and the international issues
leading. Kom^ of the specialties which are rarely
dealt in scored even heavier losses on light deal- I
ings.
1 he fie.line in the general market was checked !
in the tirst hour, htrong houses having turned up
us Dnyers of the tndard issues for investment.
London subsequently bought liberally of St. Paul I
iind other international Issnes. The foreign duv- I
ing of S:. Paul was 011 a lar^'e scale, some estimat- \
in^ it at m'.ly 10.IMH) shares. Ibe result was h rise j
of anywhere from i-o to S\/ 2 percent. Tobacco
led the forwanl movement, and sold as high as 80.
The Irangers. Louisville and Nashville, .Sugar, â 
Chicago <ias. Leather preferred. Manhattan and
Western Union all shared in the improvement.
In the afternoon some highly sensational rumors i
retarding the European political situation were !
Circulated. One was that the German Embassador I
hail been tired on in I o-nlon. The rumor origi- |
nated here, was leleurapht d to Boston as a report
current in the hoard, and was later sent from 803
--ion to Niw York as an actual fact. Of course
ther^ was nothing In it. Thf- gold withdrawals had
H little more effect in the last. hour. The with
drawals and engagements of the metal for export
were reported at $3,475,000.
Against this there was deposited $17,000,000 in
pold in exchange for greenbacks by various city !
hanks and bullion dealers. The sensational ru- \
mors and the gold movement resulted in a reaction 1
of V!@l percent In ihe general list and 2' â¢> prr

cent in some of the active slocks and gains of

made to suffer by the action of th" hog market,
which declined this morning as much ns it ad

buyers. May pork closed 15c under yesterday,

It Made Him Talk.
A capital story is told of the way in
which a New England Ssnator was once
aroused to make a stirring speech. At the
outset of his political career he had been
known as a remarkably clever orator ol
the stump, and later on in the iower
House of ihe Legislature he made a bril
liant name for himself. But when he be
came a Senator he ceased talking, mnch to
the regret of hi 9 friends and admirers.
Finally the liquor law came up for discus
sion, and the wife of tne friend of the Sen
ator, who was much interested in its pas
sage, was disappointed to see that the
brilliant man had no apparent intention
of joining in the discussion. She sat down
and wrote a few words on a sheet cf paper
which she inclosed in an envelope and
sent by a messenger to the Senator: ''Do
speak! Even Balaam's ass spoke once!"
This brought the Senator to his feet and
elicited one of the best speeches be ever
made. â Youth's Companion.
The Azhar at Cairo is the preat univer
sity of the Mohammedan faith. It was
founded A. D. 1000, and from 10,000 to
12,000 persons are always in attendance,
gathered from all parts of Africa. There
are 321 sheiks or instructors.

WAS TOLD TO ACT CRAZY.
How De Costa Says Judge Frick
Was Deceived by a
Guardian.
PARTED WITH HIS MONEY.
A C ever Scheme Exposed by Which
It Was Hoped He Would Re
gain Possession of It.
>an Francisco Call,)
- Broaaway, Jan. 7. \
A very remark) . was told Judge
Frick this morning during the proceedings
Be [gnacio at Costa restored to
.ty.
. tew months ago De Costa was pos
v.â iili which he intended to
. â  ; and spend the remainder
of bis day- in : : s Dative land. Before
â¢rever, he met Martin Wences-
I that he persuaded the
'ortaguesa to remain In Oakiand, and
:! he would turn over his money to
Wencealow, the latter would provide him
a comfortable home for the rest of liis
Not many days after De Costa had
1 arted ,\ith his money and Wenceslow had
put him out of his house.
At this stage of the proceedings J. Mar
tin appeared on the scene. He told De
Costa that the only way he could get his
money back would "be by beirs; declared an
incompetent. Martin said that he would
see to the proceedings, a:nl in the cour>oof
tiir.e the application to be declared incom
petent was liled, and -ifter a hearing before
Judge Frick. Martin was appointed guar
dian of the oid man.
To Keep the plan from being discovered
De Costa commenced to lose his memory
and suddenly exhibited evidence of a
failing mind. After a time he became
tired of being treatÂ«J as in imbecile while
his riiind was as strong as ever and he told
the story to two of his friends. His attor
neys had a petition on hand to have De
Costa restored to competency, and were
ready to proceed against Wenceslow in a
civil suit, v ben they beard of the fraud.
' The petition was on the calendar for this
morning and when De Codta's friends,
Gregory^ Zeilick md J. Silva, told the story
as they had heard it from the old man,
Judge Fr:ck ordered' the Sheriff to produce
J. Martin, that he mi^ht explain his ac
tions. In addition to these witnesses, Rose
Andre, a niece, who lives with De
Costa' s family, testified that she had never
seen anything in her uncle's actions that
would iead her to believe that he was in
.sane ur that he was in Â«ny way unable to
take care of his lirs.
The investigation will be continued to
morrow morning and Martin will have an
opportunity to explain his position in the
Complication.
WHAT IS POKER?
Kxpert* DiÂ«Â«u*sthÂ« "Draw" an Distinct
l'roiu Other Kinds of Poker.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 7.â About a
monti: ago four young fellows named B. A.
Turner, George Meader, P. Lestrange and
J. Cahill were arrested charged with
{.'ambling. The arrests were mad< in a
saloon conducted by Pete O'Brien and J.
Cahill, one of the defendants, at Twelfth
and XVcbster streets, by rgeant Hodpkins.
Ti'ej are beeping to v-l;.. c convicti â¢ on
the plea that they piayed only '-draw
poker." The State law enumerates a lot
of cames amu:iÂ» those prohibited, but
makes no mention of poker. On this they
claim that "draw" poker is not, gambling '
according to the law.
George C. Kaufman, city expert and
private secretary to Mayor Davie, was
called as a witness in behalf of the prose
cution. He was asked if he had not gone
ts Serjeant Hodgkins and said Cahill, one
of the defendants, was a friend of his,
that Cahill had told him the party were
playing a certain banking game. Kauf
man denied making such statement,
but said he had told Sodcjkins that Cahill
had said they were playing "draw" poker.
Serpeant HoagKins took the stand and
swore that Kaufman did say that Cahill
tolci him they were playing said game.
The defendant also took the stand and
swore they were playing "draw" poker.
An out^.der, however, swore that they
were playing the other kind of poker. The
defendant's attorney argued that even were ,
it proved the men were playing horse
poker it would have to be shown it was a
!>ercentage or banking game to make it
gambling under the law. Prosecuting At
torney Meivin opposed such an argument,
claiming the law named the game and not
the way it was piayect to be a gambling
game.
Judge Wood accepted the latter view,
but withheld his final decision upon the
men until to-morrow.

ALLEGED BRIBERY.
A Trial of an ImHctmojit Auainst a
Kailroail Detective.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 7.-George H.
KelloÃn, the ex-detective of the Southern
Pacific Railroad, who W33 indicted by a
Grand Jury a year ago on a charge of at
tempting to secure a bribe, is to be tried.
The trial was begun in .Judge Greene's de
partment of the Superior Court to-day.
The whole session was consumed in secur
ing a jury.
Geor-e Savage and PhiJ Brown were ar
rested at the pier by Keiloge on a charge
of bavins picked a woman's pocket of a
purse containing $180. Brown secured a
bond and disappeared, while Savage has
never been tried owing to tue complaining
witness hav:n? none to Honolulu.
Savage's uncle is a bookmaker in San
Francisco. He told the Grand Jury that
KelJogg offi-red to "'square" Savage's case
in the Superior Court, where he was
charged with grand larceny, for $200. A
number of incriminating letters, signed
"Boston," are said to have been written
by Kellogg to Savage. The latter is said
to be a young man of unsavory reputation
in San Francisco police circles.
Lamb May Recoxer.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 7.â Thomas
Lamb, the ex-convict who was shot by
Oihcer Lee Andrews yesterday noon while
attempting to escape, is resting easy to
night. He is a confirmed "liend" and" the
>urgeons who are attending his case
have given him large doses of
"dope" to keep him quiet last night, but
he kept up constant groans and yells of
pain. To-day ha has rested easier and
been more docile.
A consultation by Drs. Dunn, Hamlin
and Johnson was held this afternoon, and
it was decided the ball had not penetrated
the bowels, as at first believed. It was de
cided that no operation was necessary at
present, but it would be better to await de
velopments for several days and see how
matters would turn out. There is danger
of peritonitis as long as the bullet remainÃ
in the vital portion of the body.
OflÃcer Andrews is greatly distressed
over the serious nature of the wound. He
said to-day he regretted extremely the re
sult of his shot, but believed he was doing
nothing more than his full duty in bring
ing Lamb down after the prisoner had been
warned to stop several times and disobeyed
the commands. Lamb apparently believed
Andrews was only running a bluff, or he
would have stopped instead of replying
with an oath and continuing his flight.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 8, 1896.
MORE MIXED THAN EVER.
The Council Passes Measures
That Override the Mayor's
Objections.
CONTRACTORS ARE WARNED.
All the Municipal Departments Come
in Contact With the Dollar
Tax Limit.
Oakland Office San Fraxcisco Call,)
90S Broadway. Jan. 7. j
It is very evident, after last night's
meeting of the City Council, that there is
to be a bitter political warfare between the
Mayor and the city's chief administrative
body so long as they continue in office.
No possible opportunity is ignored by
either side to lire at the other, and the re
sults are now beginning to be seen. The
Mayor, anxious to prove that a dollar tax
is sufficient to run the city economically,
will not sign any requisition that he does
not feel certain is necessary, and an at
tempt to take this power away from him a
few months ago failed for want of votes.
As no requisition can be legally supplied
without the signature of the executive
the city's expenditure was checked for a
time at the pi asure of the Mayor.
To Chief of Police Lloyd belongs the
credit of having discovered a way to cir
cumvent, the situation and arrive at the
desired end by other means. "I felt con
vinced," said Chief Lloyd to-day, "that
there must be a clause in the charter that
provides for just such an emergency. I
read carefully till I came to a section that
distinctly confers upon the Council the
power to make such requisitions. I re
ferred the matter to the City Attorney, and
he told me I was right, so I had to show
the Mayor that his unwarrantable inter
ference with the Police Department would
not be tolerated. George Kaufman, whose
standing I know not, was behind the rail
of the Police Office on Saturday, and 1
ordered him to move out unless he showed
me an authorization that he was sent by
the Mayor in the capacity of an expert."
After the Chief of Police had successfully
enlisted the sympathy and action of the
Council against the Mayor, Superintendent
of Streets Miller tried his band with equal
success. Councilman Bajsett, the tried
friend of the Mayor, gave some figures
that required an" expFanation from Mr.
Miller. When the Perry-street sewer was
ordered to be repaired Miller sent a requi
sition to the Mayor, calling for supplies
amounting to $312 50. When the job was
linishfd the material consumed footed up '
$126 87. This, Bassett said, was a fair
sample of the judgment shown in the
street Department. The Council accepted
Mr. Miller's explanation that what was '
not used on one job would oe used on the
other, and granted new supplies under the
same section of the charter by which the
CLief of Police had been accommodated.
The peculiar part of the requisitions con
sists of the fact that thÂ«Â»y were passed by
the Board of Works, of which the Mayor
is a member, and then tarried in the
Mayor's office.
"if those supplies are granted without
my signature, 1 ' said the Mayor this morn
ing," there will be a lot of trouble, and 1
warn contractors against supplying them.
As a matter of fact, the present condition
of affairs at the City Hall is the veriest
kind of farce. The "Council has under
taken to break me politically by expend
ing all the money they can, aiid by this
means prove that the dollar tax fs not
sufficient for the city's needs. When I
try to check them by "refusing to sign ex
travagant requisitions they try to get
around it another way. One-haff the city
officials do not know their duty and the
other half is run by their friends. The
situation is absolutely funny, if it were not
serious. It is not easy at this stage of the
game to predict the end."
CONTROLLING THE LIGHT
Berkeley Still Wondering Over
the Electric Company
Changes.
Mrs. Carpmkel's Sad ConditionâCres
cent Club Electionâ Campus
Fund.
BERKELEY. Cal., Jan. 7.â The Berke
ley Electric Lighting Company is no
longer an institution controlled by the
citizens of the town for their own self
comfort and accommodation.
It is a mystery to the people of Berkeley
just how the old Block company, of which
J. George Gardner was the primogenitor,
gained such absolute control of the insti
tution which was primarily formed for the
purpose of furnishing lighting service to
the residents of Berkeley at the lowest pos
sible rate, but which has been converted
into a business for the benefit of a few.
The extensive transfer of stock to the Oak
land company has been the cause of much
comment, especially among those who
were interested in the founding of tho
original system, and every one is watch
ing with anxiety to see what move the
capitalists who now have it under control
will make. No changes have yet been re
ported in the management, but there
seems to exist much apprehension alonj,
the line.
President Britton, who was elected last
night, visited Berkeley, and spent part of
the morning in examining the books of
the old company.
Crescents Elect Officers.
BERKELEY. Cat.., Jar.. 7.â The annual !
eiectioiijof othcers of tne Crescent Athletic
Club took place la?t evening. Piior to the
election the reports of officers for the year
iust closed were read. In President Jvlik
klesen's report it was stated that on Janu
ary 1. 1895. the membership of the club
was 35, and that during the year the roll
was increased to 128. The gymnasium ap
paratus was increased materially by the
purchase of bars, dumbbells, Indian clubs,
Doxing gloves and other acc-*sories.
Treasure:- Wilcox stated that lie had re
ceived during the year $1195 S3 and ex
pended $1028*03, leaving a cash balance on
hand of $37 80. Following is the list of the
newly elected officers: President, H. D.
Keisey; vice-president, S. H. Metoalf; re
cording secretary, VV. H. G jinpertz; treas
urer, Frank McClftin ; financial secretary
W. H. Hone; leader, G. L. Wilcox; held

Deserted by Her Husband.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 7.-Mr 3 . E. C.
Carpmael, who was deserted by her hus
band several months ago after an unsuc
cessful attempt to have her sent to the
insane asylum, is i ow in straitened cir
cumstances, and has made en appeal for
assistance, offering several fancy articles
to b<- raffltd. The Carpmael case elicited
much attention last May when the lady
appeared before Judge Ogden on a charge
of insanity preferred by her husband, who j
was at that time a student in Toiand Mcdi- I
cal College. Judge Ogdeu decided that I
there wag no case against Mra. Carpmael,
and it was generally believed that Carp
mael's actions were part of a plan to se
cure a divorce.
Later she was deserted by her husband,
who is believed to have returned to Eng
land, whence he came to California after
graduating from the University of London
in 1892. Since her desertion Mrs. Carp
mael has been seriously ill, and recently
she has been attempting to maintain her
children by canvassing.
Board of Education.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 7.â The Board
of Education met last evening and trans
acted a large amount of routine business.
Bills to the amount of $1507 20 were
ordered paid. The position of truant
officer was declared vacant, after a heated
discussion. Miss C. Germania Potevin
was appointed teacher in charge of the
Rose-street school without increase of
salary.
Principal Waterman reported the enroll
ment and attendance at the four East
Berkeley schools for the present month as
foilows: Number enrolled, 1275; daily
attendance, 11G7. High school, enrolled,
280; daiiy attendance, 274, making a total
enrollment of 1555, anu a daily attendance
of 1441.
Principal Warnick of the West Berkeley
schools reported a total enrollment of 459
and a daily attendance of 412.
Slow but Certain.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 7.â The sub
scriptions to the $1000 fund to be used in
furnishing electric apparatus for lighting
the university grounds, according to the
plan of Regent Reinstein, are coming in
very slowly. Thus far only $(i3O ims been
subscribed, the latest contribution being
that of Professor Soule, who gave $5.
Though newly three weeks have passed
since the list was put into circulation
headed by a subscription from F. M. Wil
son, and though only $130 has been raised
since, yet Regent Reinstein states that he
has implicit faith that the citizens of
Berkeley will subscribe the balance re
quired.
Condition of John R. Perkins.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 7.â John R.
Perkins, the victim of Albert Munzen
meyer's pistol shot at Lorin on Christmas
eve, has been removed from the Oakland
Receiving Ilosnital to the home of his
sister, Mrs. J. C. Rodgers, on Ellsworth
street. Perkins' friends entertain strong
hopes of nis recovery, bat the physicians
state that under the best of circumstances
it will be a considerable length of time
before he can go about his business again.
Death of Mrs. Hennessy.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 7.â Mra. C.
Hennessy died at her residence on Dwight
way last night of consumption. She was
a native of England and came to Berkeley
many year 3 ngo. Tne funeral will take
place from her late residence to-morrow
morning at 11 o'clock under the auspices
of trie Episcopal church.
Installation of Officers.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 7.â Berkeley
Lodge, No. 1941, Knights and Ladies of
Honor, will install their officers for the
coming year next Monday evening. The
grand protector, grand treasurer and
grand lecturer of the State are expected to
be present.
A TEMPORARY BUILDING
Alameda Proposes to Erect One
to Be Used for Its Public
Library.
No More Indiscriminate Shooting to
Be Allowed on Bay Farm
Island.
ALAMEDA, Cai., Jan. 7.â The Board of
Library Trustees met in monthly session
last night. For several months, or ever
since the decision was arrived at not to
put the library in the new City Hall, an
effort has been made to build a splendid
$20,000 building by private subscription
and guarantee, bat the undertaking was
too large a one and is now temporarily
abandoned, and instead it is proposed to
erect on the lot purchased years ago for
the purpose a wooden building about 50x80
in size to serve temporarily until such
time as a permanent and pretentious
building may be erected. The temporary
building will not be unsightly as to architec
ture. It will stand on its lot without an
exposure, and will be fqually safe as to nre
as the present library quarters are. It is
estimated that it 3 cost will about equal
the rent of the present quarters for two
years, or $2000. It is planned so that,
when built, it will not be interfered with
when the large fire-proof building is
finally erected. The latter may be built
over and around it.
During the past month 427 volumes were
added to the library.
Now Athletic Grounds.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 7-â The direc
tors of the Acme Athletic Club of Oak
land, which, however, has a very large
Alameda contingent in its membership,
are negotiating with the directors of the
Southern Pacific Company for the lease of
enough of the marsh land west, of Webster
stret't roadway and near the ship-building
yards on Oakland Creek. The marsh has
here, to a considerable extent, been filled
in by the dumping of sand upon it from
the dredge at work in the cieek channel.
On bunday a sort of test of the grounds
will be made by playing a baseball game
on them. It was decided to close the ne
gotiations if favorable enough and to pro
ceed with the improvement of the grounds.
If a lease is> secured it will be for ten
years and the grounds be put in order.
Among other tilings it is proposed
to put in a bicycle track. This
would .seem to show that the old Schuet
zen Park, which so many supposed wa:<
the objective point of all efforts to estab
lish athletic grounds here, is not the lo
cation desired by the athletes.
Shooting Prohibited.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 7. â It is now a
misdemeanor to shoot game on the
marshes of Bay Farm Island. Amateur
hunters, mostly" from San Francisco, were
in the habit of visiting the island in great
numbers and shooting at dncks and rail in
the most reckless manner. It got so thai
it was daofterooa to travel on the island
roads, especially on Sunday. The hunters
were lawless also in shooting at every tiling
in sight besides the game that abounds.
The globes on the electric lights were
several times shot to pieces. Some of the
inhabitants petitioned for the restraining
ordinance, but when the Municipal Board
got ready to enact it some other inhabi
tants protested. The board overruled the
protest by a vote of 3 to 1 and the ordi
nance i-- now in force. â¢
Mills College Opened.
MILLS COLLEGE P. 0., Alameda
County, Cal.. Jan. 17.â Mills College re
opened yesterday with good numbers. The
corps of teachers remained unchanged. It
was feared for a time that Miss Ege, who
has charge of the mathematics, would be
obliged to leave on account of tlia death of
friends, but it has been arranged that she
is to remain. The r;nnor setting abroad
thai she might possibly leave, thirty-four
applications were madu for the place,
thirty of them coming from the East.
Most of the teachers have remained at
Mills College during vacation, as they are
welcome to do, and have been attending
the Teachers' Association in Oakland.

READY TO BUY THE BONDS
Morgan's Syndicate Yet Intact
and Will Soon Make
a Bid.
AWAITING AN OPPORTUNITY.
Treasury Officials Watch With Inter
est the Renewed Attack on
the Gold Reserve.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 7. -There were
no new developments in regard to the pro
posed $100,000,000 Government popular
loan to-day and the more prominent bank
ers, as usual, were not disposed to talk
freely on the matter.
The Morgan syndicate, according to
good authorities, is still intact and will,
in all probability, make a bid for the bonds
at the proper time. A feature which at
tracted attention this morning was the en
gagement of $2,000,000 for shipment to
Europe by to-morrow's steamers. It was
said that as much more will probably go
on Saturday.
Fears are entertained that the further
withdrawals for foreign account might
start tip a demand from possible bidders
for the new loan. There is no way to pre
vent this.
The Belmont-Morean syndicate, it will
be remembered, expressly stipulated that
the gold for the bonds should not come
from the treasury. There were the usual
rumors of an issue of Clearing-house loan
certificates, but Manager Sherer of the
Clearing-house states that no application
has been received from any of the banks.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 7.-The
treasury officials are watching with keen
interest the renewed attack on the gold
reserve and do not hesitate to express the
opinion that most of the gold now being
withdrawn is taken out by intending pur
chasers of the new bonds. They condemn
such proceedings in strong terms, but with
the present law on the statute-books see
no way to legally stop such withdrawals.
KICK El* OtT THE SOLICITOR.
Mr. Chalmers WaÂ» Subsequently Justified
â in the Act.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 7. â William J.
Chalmers, president of the great ma
chinery firm of Frazer & Chalmers, was a
prisoner before Police Justice Chott this
morning, being charged by Charles H.
Holm, a life insurance solicitor, with as
sault. Holm was engaged in the shops of
the firm yesterday, without permission,
soliciting amont; the workmen when Chal
mers asked him to retire. Holm became
indignant, and was thrown out by the
president.
The Justice in discharging the defendant
advised him, in case he was again pestered
by such agents, to use all the force in his
power, and if that was not enough to call
on the police.
MEIjVIIjTjE A. GOOD CHIEF.
Will Be JReappolnted a* Send of the JBn
gincerittg Jiureau.
NEW YOKK, N. V., Jan. 7.â A Times
special from Washington says: The term
of Engineer-in-Chief G. W. Melville will
expire on the 16th inst. lie has been
Chief of the Bureau of Steam Engineering
for eight years, and has done such good
work that Secretary Herbert has decided
to reaproint Melville for another term of
four years.
The honor thus extended Commodore
Melville is unusual. There have been few
bureau chiefs who have occupied the posi
tion for more than two years. Notable
exceptions are Admiral Walker, who was
the head of the Navigation Bureau for a
long time, and Admiral Ramsay, who is
filling his third term as chiei of the same
bureau.
BACKWARD IX Accovyrs.
Among the Delinquents Is TSint Superin-
tendent I>aggett.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 7.â The
Secretary of the Treasury to-day sent to
the House a list of officers of the Govern
ment coming under his department who
are delinquent in rendering their accounts
or in thepnyment of balunces due from
them for the last fiscal year. The list in
cludes A. R. Spofford, Librarian of Con
gress; Eiihu Olund, Collector of Customs,
Duluth, Minn.; Overton Cade, Superin
tendent of the Mint at New Orleans, and
John Dangett. Superintendent of the Mint
at San Francisco.
WESTERN FREIGHT POOL
Practically Assured by All the
Railroads in the Asso
ciation.
Only One Line Remains Opposed to the
Great Scheme in Its
Entirety.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 7.â The formation
of a Western freight pool by the railroads
which are members of the Western Freight
Association was practically assured after a
meeting to-day in Chairman Midgley's
office of the executive officers of the inter
ested lines. The stumbline block in the
way of the freight officials, when they
were ordered last October to arrange a
percentage divi-ion of the total traffic, was
in regard to the business originating: at or
passing through Kansas City. A disagree
ment on three points in that part of the
Western territory was reported to the ex
ecutive officers, according tr> instructions,
and at to-day's meeting there was a sur
prising agreement on these points. The
officers adjourned the meeting until to
morrow, when the only points unsettled,
Dcs Moines and Ottumwa traffic, will be
considered.
The Kansas City, Fort Scott and Mem
phis road was opposed to the pooling
scheme in its entirety as not being the
best method of restoring and maintaining
rates, and its antagonism prevented the
freight officials agreeine on the merchan
dise and grain percentage to and from
Kansas City, the Fort Scott being an im
portant factor at that gateway. When all
percentages are fixed cy the executive
officers they must remain in effect for a
year, and can only be changed then by a
discontented party giving notice next No
vember.
At the quarterly meeting: of the Western
Passenger Association to-day the agree
ment of local ugeats who had honored
second-class tickets on first-class sleepers
was ordered rescinded. A committee was
also appointed to report to-morrow the re
duced rates which will be made for the
Grand Army National Encampment at St.
Paul and the triennial conclave of the
Knights of Pythias at Minneapolis.
The passenger committee of the Central
Traffi * Association at a meeting held to
day decied to join in the agreement of tne
Western Association to charge for the
transportation of bicycles in baggage cars
at the rate of fifty pounds excess baggage
or a minimum of 25 cents each. Both
agreements go into effect March 1.
DEVOTED ALL TO THE CAUSE.
Death of Mme. Sophie He/r/gef, Who So
Heroically Gave Her Money and Ser
vice in the War.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 9. -A Recorder
special from Cincinnati says: Unmourned
and without a friend o r relative to be with
her in her last hours, Sophie Helrigel, who
has for years been before the Cincinnati
public, died yesterday at the City Infirm
ary, where she lived for months.
Mme. Sophie Helrigel was born in
France, whence, in 1850, she came to Cin
cinnati. She was a brilliant woman, of
excellent education, spoke English, Ger
man, French, Spanish, Flemish and
Dutch, and had no trouble in establishing
a successhil private school for languages.
When the War of the Rebellion broke
out she had amassed a small fortune. She
entered the service, followed the Ninth
Ohio to the battle-fields, attended to the
wounded soldiers and devoted the greater
part of her fortune to the establishment of
field hospitals. Through her three years'
service she carried an ordinary soldiers'
canteen, and this, together with a flag,
which she had also acquired in the service,
was the one treasure of her life.
So great was her veneration for the stars
and stripes that her dying request was that
she be wrapped in this flag before being
consigned to her coffin.
After the war Mme. Helrigel returned to
Cincinnati. Her health was lost during
the Hardships of the war and her mind be
came more or less uffected and prevented
her from pursuing her occupation. Since
then she has practically been an object of
charity. An effort was made to secure
her a pension, but it failed. She left a last
statement in which she exhorted her old
comrades to stick to the flag.
SWEPT BY PRAIRIE FIRES
Thousands of Acres in Kansas
Have Been Burned
Over.
One Town Has Probably Been De
stroyed and Much Farm Prop
erty Laid in Ruins.
WICHITA, Kans., Jan. 7.â Portions of
Kiowa, Stafford, Edward and Pratt coun
ties are being swept by prairie fires which
light up the sky until from the distance
its apppearance is that of a red sunset.
The extent of the destruction has not been
definitely learned, for the reason that the
desolated country is entirely cut off from
telegraphic communication.
The branch of the Missouri Pacific Rail
road from Alcottwest, which runs through
the fire-3wept district, has been abandoned
for several months and all telegraph offices
along the lino discontinued, hence the de
tails obtainable are very meager.
There is no telegraphic communication
with luka, in Pratt County, on the aban
doned branch, but reports from Dodge
City, Kinsley, Stafford, St. Jobn, Lamed
and other surroundins towns lead to the
apprehension that the town lias been
swept away.
Thousands of acre? have been burned
over, and the loss of property will be con
siderable. Ten years ago, while Kansas
was having its wonderful boom, the
country out there was thickly settled and
the land "s'as all plowed up.
The hard times live years ago drove
most of the people out, and since that
time the land has grown up in weeds and
sunflowers. That is the reason the fire
burns with such fury. Out in Finney
County, near the Colorado line, another
big prairie tire is rasing. The latter fire
can be plainly seen from Pueblo, and cov
ers thousands of acres of grass lands.
DEBTS OF THE PACIFIC ROADS.
Chairman Tower* Will Only Permit
JBrief Hearing*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 7.â The Pa
cific railroad debt question was broached
for the first time this session when the
House committee met and organized to
day. There was not much discussion, and
business W3S confined to the organization.
It was decided that the committee shall
meet again next Saturday, when it is ex
pected the various bills will be discussed.
Only brief hearings will be allowed, ac
cording to Chairman Powers. This means
the funding bill will be "railroaded"
through.
Beqator Allen of Nebraska to-day intro
duced a bill which will find favor with the
opponents of the Southern Pacific monop
oly. It provides that the Secretary of the
Treasury shall compute and ascertain the
amount due the Government by the va
rious Pacific (bond-aided) roads. The Sec
retary shall certify the same to the Attor

A Permanent Census Bureau.
If a permanent census oiiice is to be es
t all, the initiative legislation
ng to that result should be taken
without delay, for under such legislation
er m lit be rÂ»laced at the head of
Buch an office would have ample opportu
nity to study the whole question and to
â¢ to < longress full ami comprehensive
plans for future census work. There are
these tliret: reasons, then, for prompt legis
lation: Tli? action looking to the unifica
tion of o-rtain inquiries ni the various cen
'â [ the world for 19<jO; the necessity
oi preparation for the twelfth census; the
desire to establish a- permanent census
In considering these three reasons
ti:t-rf is m> necessity of indulging in any
criticisms, for all criticism must come
back to the fact that there lias been no one
whose particular duty it was to see to it
that proner preparations were made, not
only for legislation, but for the real work
of t: c census.â Colonel Carroll I). Wright

BOWMAN RENEWS A FORMER CHALLENGE
He Denounces Father Yorke
for Avoiding a
Debate.
A CHARGE OF COWARDICE
The A. P. A. Editor Says the
Catholic Champion Shirks
the Issue.
FATHER YORKE AND THE POPE.
Explains the Position, Power and
Limitations of the Head of
the Church.
The following communication has been
received by The Call in relation to the
controversy :
To the. Editor of the Sun Francisco Callâ Dear
Sin: l see that Priest Yorke has acted the part
of a crawfish aivi sought to avoid an argument
with me. This act stamps him as a moral cow
ard. v\ ho dare not lace a man who holds the
proofs of the devilish character of Romanism
in his possession. His attempt to crawl out at
the back door of Buisun will not work. In re
fard to his statement I wish to make the fol
owmg remt.r
Firstâ We only have the word of Priest
Yorke for proof of the $100 awaiting us in
Mnsun. As Priest Yorke has proved himself
5 of the title of champion prevaricator
during the pending controversy it would be
an act of folly to place any reliance upon his
word.
Bee >ndâ l did not say 1 took any quotation
from the Catholic World. I quoted different
Catholic authorities, but did not stale that I
cut them from the papers.
Thirdâ l have never heard what the quota
tion was. How can I verify it until 1 know
â what quotation he refers to? I will give him
all the quotations from the Catholic World
that he wants before I am done with him.
Fourthâ had rather "mount" my 'â¢scissors
and set forth to defend distressed damsels in
Brazil" than to imitate Priest York in mount
ing the papal jackass and trying to run away
from the truth. I will prove, Mr. Editor, with
your permission, that Priest Yorke has misrep
resented the teachings of his church to make
it appear decent in the eyes of the American
people. In fact, I can prove that he misrepre
sented the position of Archbishop Hughes on
the school question; that he told what was
false in regard to rel'glous liberty in Spain;
that he prevaricated in regard to the union of
church and state, and that he garbled the en
cyclical 01 Pope Leo on the "Christian Consti
tution of States." I hold in my possession a
great many Catholic publications, containing
powder enough to explode the whole castle of
falsehood that Priest Yorke has reared in the
columns of your press.
Furthermore, 1 herewith publicly renew my
challenge to Priest Yorke to discuss upon the
platform or in the columns of the press the
following propositions:
Firstâ Romanism is a huge political machine,
run in the interests of the l'ODe. and used to
crush out National independence and bring all
nations under the scepter of the world's great
est despotâ the Pope of Rome.
Secondâ Romanism is a foe of free thought,
an enemy <â : free speech, an opposer of civil
and religious liberty and an unreconcilable
opponent of universal education.
Thirdâ Romanism is a bar to civilization, a
barrier to political progress, a hindrance to !
social development and a check to intellectual
advancement.
Fourthâ Romanism is the feeding-ground of
rasra'.ity, the incubator of lust, the nursery of
vice, he hotbed 01 iniquity and cesspool of sin.
Fifthâ Romanism is a manufactory of pau
pers and a nursery of criminals.
Sixthâ Romanism is un-American and not in
sympathy with our institutions and, in fact, ig
constantly working to weaken and destroy
them.
Seventhâ Romanism is a foreign institution,
â with foreign political principles and a foreign
spirit. The Monroe doctrine applied to Satolli
and the Jesuits would fire them back to Rome
duty free.
ithâ Romanism, as the persistent enemy
of our public school system, is a foe of the
republic and should be treated as such.
Ninthâ Romanism has corrupted American
politics to aid her in capturing the Govern
ment By fair means or foul it has aimed at i
obtaining all the offices possible.
Tenthâ Romanism has systematically plun
dered the American people until patience has
ceased to be a virtue. The Government de
partments in Washington are overrun with
begging nuns, who extort money from the
employes.
Eleveuthâ Romanism has been the ruina
tion of every country, socially, politically,
financially, industrially and religiously,
wherever it has had complete domination.
Twelfthâ Romanism is political anarchism.
It is the foster mother of ignorance, and the
friend of intolerance. It relies upon brute j
force rather than reason and upon the boycott
instead of logic to win in an argument.
But Priest York dare not meet the issue. He
knows tnat his refuge of lies might be swept
away, and Romanism laid bare to the public !
gaze. He has dodged the issue long enough.
As a raember of the A. P. A. and editor of one
of their papers. I claim the right to take him
to task for his misrepresentations, and make
him face the issue instead of dodging it.
Below we submit the challenge to Priest
Yorke that appeared in the American Patriot
November 9, 1895:
A SECOND CHALLENGE.
Peter C. Yorker Courage and Ability to
Be Tested.
h. w. KOWMAS'B proposition.
On the 28th of September last H. W. Bowman
pub'.isned a challenge 10 any representative mem
ber ot" the Y. M. L of this Mate to meet him In a
joint debate at the Metropolitan Temple of this i
t.uy. That challenge was left open for three
weeks, but was not accepted. During the latter
part of October Mr. Bowman addressed th" people
of Suisun from the A. P. A. point of view, and on *
the 31st Of that month Peter ('. Yorke of thÂ«
Monitor publicly replied to Mr. Bowman at Suisun
from shortunnd notes of Mr. Bowman's lecture
which had l>een taken for Mr. Yorke's sDecial use.
This reply of the Monitor man was thoroughly
advertised in the locality and the A. P. A. people
decided to test the metal of Yorke. They, there
fore, sent 10 this city and secured a thoroughly
competent A. P. A. to go upon the platform with
Mr. Yorke and discuss with him at the time the
Bubjeci-matierof his address. This proffer was de
clined by those who had the arrangements of Mr
Yorke's address in their care. In other words,
Mr. Yorke did not dare to face an A. I. A. oppo
nent in a joint public discussion on the points of
Mr. Bowman's lecture in this little Interior town.
Mr. Bowman, who is at present in Los Angeles
with his family, haying ln-ard of this backdown
on the part of Mr. Yorke, determined to put that
Rentleinan's courage to a further tÂ«st here in San
I-'rancisco.
Accordii.Kly he lias sent a final challenge from
Los Angeles, which is as follows:
757 Pasadena Aye., â¢ â )
Kast I.os Asgkiks, < al., Dec. 1. 1895. I
Pru- C. Yorke, lit Eddy ttrtet. San Francisco,
Cal.â Sib: I hereby challenge you to pub
licly debate the following proposition:
Jlesolved, That Komanlam is a huge political ma
chine, a bar to civilization, a foe. to civil and re
litdous liberty, an enemy to the American public
school system of education and a dangerous factor
In our .National politics.
H. W. Bowmak, aflirmatlve.
Peter (". Yorkk, negative
The general conditions of this proposed debate
to be as follows:
SaiJ discussion to be held in San Francisco in a
large public hall within this month. Time and
place of debate to be arranged subsequently to suit
the convenience of the parii-'iiiants.
Admission tothe building to be by ticket, at the
minimum cost of not less than ten VlO) cents and
a maximum or twenty-live >'2b) cents. The ex
pMMes to be sliarpd equally between both parties
and the excess, if any, to be used In printing the
debate for circulation.
The discussion to last three (3) ni(rhts. two (2)
hours ouch night, divided into four (4) speeches of
thirty (SO) minutes each.
You msy address me at the meriean Patriot
oflice. I reoiuin, sir, yours in the best interests of
the republic. H. \V. Bowman.
If, as Mr. Vorke has said in public print, be has
Highest of all in Leavening Power. â Latest U. S. Gov't Report
ABSOLUTELY PURE
no other aim than to put before his fellow-citizens
ot all classes and nerds what he believes is the
truth in this unfortunÂ«te controversy, we surest
that he could not have a better opportunity than
an oral discussion with Mr. Bowman before a mis
celkini-ous audience in tins City. Ami we suDmit
to the readers of The Patriot, and to good Ameri
can cltlsens, Irrespective of political or religious
creeds, chat ne reasonable excuse can lie assigned
for declining Mr. Bowman's challenge, except that
of conscious inability to successfully coniiiat the
opposition to Romanism In American politics ami
its interference in our system of public education.
Now, Mr. Editor, we assert that if Priest
Yorke had been conlident of the strength of
his position he would have been eager to de
bate the question with me. As this is a dis
cussion of principles instead ot persons, we
will present the proofs for our propositions,
and I'riest Yorke can answer or ignore them
as he deems best. H. W. Bowman.
FATHER YORKE EXPLAINS.
He Discusses the Powers and Limitations of
the Pope.
Father Yorke sends the following com
munication to The Call:
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sin: In my
last letter I explained the following points:
1. Christianity is a message from God toman
delivered by Jesus Christ.
2. This message is truth, and therefore is
one, consistent and unchangeable.
3. This message was given by Christ to his
disciples, with authority to teach it to all men
and tnroughout all time.
4. Hence, this authority belongs to the disci
| pies in their corporate capacity; hence this
corporation is infallible.
5. Our Lord constituted St. Peter the ruler of
ih;~ corporation or society.
0. The Pope is the successor of St. Peter as
the head of this society, to which was given
the mission of teaching" revelation.
1 will now consider the powers of the Pope,
and from this consideration show that there is
; nothing in these powers which interferes with
civil allegiance.
Iâ THE POWERS OF THK POPE.
1. The Pope as the successor of St. Peter holds
the supreme authority in that society organized
by < hrist to teach his revelation.
2. In every society the supreme authority
implies supreme legislative, executive and
judicial powers. These powers may be lodged
in different persons or in the one person.
3. The supreme legislative, executive and
judicial powers in the church are centered in
the Pope.
4. Supreme power does not mean absolute or
erbitrary pover. In Amorica neither the
President, Congress, nor the Supreme Court
possesses arbitrary power, though each pos
sesses supreme power. Their powers are
limited by the constitution of the United
States.
5. The Pope possesses in the church supreme
legislative, executive and judicial power, but
this power is limited by the constitution of the
church.
6. Hence the Pope cannot pass a law violating j
or repealing a law ol God or a law of Christ.
He cannot declare that perjury is lawful, or
that stealing is not sinful, or that murder is to
be oommenaed.
7. Hence in his executive action he cannot
interfere with the organization of the church,
or abolish bishops, or dispense with priests, or
add to or take from the sacraments.
8. Hence in his judicial action he cannot !
ada to or take away from divine revelation, j
he cannot make new constitutional provisions j
i or destroy old ones; be cannot invent doc- '
trines neither can he suppress them.
IIâ THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE TOrE.
1. The end for which (hrist established his j
church was to teach his revelation.
2. It is but natural that in the course of time i
disputes should arise about doctrines, some
men saying that Christ revealed them, others ;
J that he did not.
3. These disputes are exactly parallel to ;
| those that arise among our lawyers concern
ing the constitutionality of certain enact- ,
I ments.
| 4. In the state the dispute is whether the pro- |
; visions of the act are in accordance with the i
provisions of the constitution. In the church I
â¢ the dispute is whether the terms of the doc- j
trine are in accordance witn the revelation.
5. In the state the Supreme Court pronounces
I finally on the dispute; in the church the Pope j
I pronounces finally on the dispute.
ti. The Pope's decision declares that the |
terms of such a doctrine are or are not in ac
cordance with revelation. Such decision is
final and must be accepted by all.
7. Since revelation is truth the Pope's de
cision declares that a certain doctrine is true
or false, and this decision binds upon all the
members of the church.
8. A decision concerning truth or falsehood,
which binds men by divine authority, must be '
an iniallible decision, because otherwise God, !
who cannot lie, would be made to stand
sponsor to error.
9. Hence, the final decision of the Pope must
be infallible, because otherwise the rock wonld
have been taken by the gates of hell, and be
cause otherwise the very power which rnrist
established to feed his sheep would have given
them poison.
lIIâ THE LIMITS OF INFALLIBILITY.
1. Infallibility does not mean freedom
from sin. David and f-'olomon were very
wicked men, yet their teachings are infal
lible.
2. Infallibility does not moan that the Pope
can deal with matters outside of revelation.
He has nothing to do with civil affairs, noth
ing to do with scientific truths. The question
before him is the question if fact has tnis doc
trine been revealed by Jesus Christ, or do these
words or facts agree or disagree with revela
; tion.
3. Infallibility does not mean that the Pope
is always at all times and under all circum
stances infallible. A Supreme Justice is not
rendering decisions when writing a lawbook
ior talking with his friends. The Pope is infal
j lible only when he acts as the supreme court
i of Christendom and declares as the teacher of
I all the faithful that a certain doctrine has or
! has not beeu revealed by Jesus Christ.
I 4. It is nardly noeessary to remark that when
acting as supreme judge in individual cases
dealing with questions of law or fact, the de
cision of the Pope is final, but not infallible.
5. It is hardly necessary to remark that, in
making or repealing laws, the Pope's action is
legal and to be obeyed, but is not infallible.
6. It is hardly necessary to remark that
â while his various executive actions are to be
received with respect or obedience, they are
not infallible.
IVâ INFALLIBILITY AND CIVIL ALLEGIANCE.
1. Civil allegiance is the obedience we owe
the constituted authorities of the state.
2. The state is absolutely independent of the
church in civil affairs. The church is abso
lutely independent of tfce state in religious
j affairs.
3. The infallibility of the Pope deals ex-
I clusnely with religious affairs, to wit, the
. question whether such or such truths are re
vealed or not.
4. Therefore, the infallibility of the Pope can
in no way clash with civil allegiance or with
the duties the citizen owes the state.
V â THE POPE AND CONSCIENCE.
1. Conscience is the law of God as it appears
to our mind here and now. It is our judgment
declaring that this present act is good and
should be done, or evil and should be avoided.
2. Hence, a collision between conscience and
the Pope is possible only when he legislates or
gives particular orders, or the like.
3. But the Pope is not infallible in his lawg,
or in his commands, or in his acts of state,
or in his administration, or in hie public
policy.
4. Therefore there can be no collision be
tween conscience and infallibility.
5. Hence tne fact tnat St. Paul withstood
St. Peter to his face proves nothing against
infallibility.
t>. Hence the doctrine of infallibility would
not prevent any Catholic from withstanding
the Pope to-day if he considered his policy
pernicious, .his policy unwise or his command's
unreasonable.
7. Self-will and rebellion and disobedience
are sins against the state as well as against
! the church, and the man who withstands the
Pope for these reasons sins not against the in
fallibility of the Pope but against his author
ity as ruler df the church.
8. But if Catholics believe that the Pope is
using his power to evil purpose they are
bound to resist him. Bellarmine says: ""It is
lawful to resist the Pope if he assaults souls or
troubles the state. (On the Pope, ii:29). Arch
bishop Kenrick says: "The Pope's power is
given for edification not for destruction. If he
uses it from the love of domination scarcely
will he meet with obedient populations/
(Moral Theol., vol. 1, p. 158.)
9. The decision as to whether the Pope is in
each particular case doing right or wrong
rests in the last resort with each one's con
science. Conscience does not mean self-will.
It means that light is sought for. that counsel
is taken, that in the presence of God each one
can say, I believe I am right.
10. If the decision is against the Pope, then
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 8, 1896.
right or wrong, the man damns his soul if he
obeys the Pope.
VIâ THE TOPE AND CIVIL ALLEGIANCE.
1. The Pope cannot come into collision with
civil allegiance by reason of his infallibility.
He may, however, come into collision with the
civil authorities by his legislative or executive
acts.
2. As he is not infallible in his legislative or
executive facts, in such collisions grievous
mistakes may have been made on both sides.
3. The question, however, is n.ji which side
is right, but what is the duty of a Catholic in
the case of such a collision. "
4. No general answer can be given to such a
question because euch must be decided on its
meri's.
."). There are some cafes in which Catholics
would obey tlie Pope and some cases in which
they would disobey him.
ti. Suppose, tor instance, a bill was passed in
Congress bidding Catholics attend Protestant
service every week, and the Popetolci us not to
do so, we should obey the Pope.
7. Suppose the United States were engaged
in a war with England or with Spain, and the
Pope siiould suddenly bid all Catholic soldiers
or sailors to desert we should not obey him.
8. The nearest appronch to a general answer
which can be given in case the Pope came inio
collision with the civil authorities is to say
that there is no duty laid upon us by our nat
ural status as citizens or the positive enact
ments of the United States constitution and
laws from which the Pope could free us.
This then is my answer to Bovard's
problem concerning the boundaries of papal
I supremacy. The Government is just as su
preme to the Catholic citizen as it is to the
non-Catholic citizen. This is true whether the
Government be what Dr. Bovard calls a
"righteous Government" or a pagan Govern
ment. The Catholic recognizes the Pope as
his superior in spiritual things, but in tem
poral things he recognizes no superior but the
commonwealth. In those matters in which
the State may clash with the Pope the Catholic
is in a similar position to the Methodist when
the State clashes with his conscience. In a
similar position I say, but the Catholic is in
an infinitely better position. Both are thrown
back on their individual judgment, both are
compelled to take sides. The Methodist, how
ever, is practically alone. He has neither
light nor experience nor the voice 01 authority
to aid him. The Catholic on the con
trary has behind him tfte experience ot
ages. The Methodist is like a land
lubber suddenly thrown amid the ropes
and spars of a great ship and left to work out
his own salvation. The Catholic is like a law
yer in the midst of a splendid library, who can
take down judgment and reference and know
what great and learned men thought of just
such cases as his. It was to the advantage
which the Catholic possesses in times of doubt
when men are thrown on themselves and are
compelled to take sides that Cardinal Manning
referred in a passage, a mutilated version of
which has appeared in the A. P. A. ash-heap:
'"The political conscience of Catholics is not
left to the individual judgment alone. It is
guarded by the whole Christian morality, by
the greatest system of ethical legislation' the
world has ever seen, the canon law and the
moral theology of the Catholic church. Not
only all capricious and willful resistances of
the civil law, but all unreasonable and con
tentious disobedience is condemned by
its authority. It is a doctrine of faith
that legitimate sovereignty exists, not
only in the unity of the church, but out
side of the same; and not only among
Christian nations, but also among the
nations that are not Christian. Moreover, that
to all such legitimate sovereigns subjects an
bound by the divine law to render obedience
in all law fail things. It is certain, therefore,
that Catholics are bound to civil allegiance by
every bond, natural and supernatural, as abso
lutely as their non-Catholic fellow-country
men, and, 1 most add, more explicitly. And
further, that they can hardly be reduced to the
necessity of using their private judgment as to
the lawfulness oi obeying any law. in all
matters of ordinary civil and political life the
duty of Catholics is already denned by a whole
code, which enforces obedience for conscience
Mike, in the rare can oi doubt, which may
arise in times of religions prosecution, political
revolution, civil wars or wars of succession,
Catholic and non-Catholic subjects arc alike in
thisâ they are both compelled to choose their
siiie. But the non-Catholic subject nas hardly
law or judge to uid his conscience; the Catho
lic baa both. He has the whole traditional
moral law of Christendom, which has formed
and perpetuated the civil and political order
of the modern world, and he has a multitude
of principles, maxims and precedentson which
to form his own judgment."
In a few days I hope to answer Mr. Bovard's
second objection about the alleged supremacy
claimed by the church over the state. Yours
truly, Peter C. Yorke.
APPROVE THE CONTKOVERSY.
Clergymen Express Their Opinion as to the
Merits and Outcome of the Great Conflict.
The following extracts from opinions of
local clergy, reprinted from the Examiner,
are of interest as voicing the sentiment of
various leaders of thought in regard to the
great controversy now being carried on.
Father Lynch of St. James' Catholic
Church:
I think this discussion has unquestionably
done much good. This haranguing against the
Catholic church that has been going on day by
day for .so long a time was calculated to influ
ence evt-n the more unbiased element in the
Protestant chnrch. Continued silence on the
part of the Catholic church was beginning to
i assume the appearance of assent. A dispas
: sionate discussion, such as Father Yorke has
conducted, especially in his later letters, will
go far toward clearing away the misconception
j that may have been formed in the minds <>f the
average Protestant. 1 think the controversy
j has cleared the atmosphere considerably.
Rev. W. W. Bolton, rector of the Church
I of St. Mary the Virein, an Episcopalian:
I can understand the position taken up by
: Father Yorke. Mr. Ross contends that the
proposition that the Pope and priests ought to
\ have dominion over temporal affairs isadoc
' trine enunciated by the Roman Catholic
; Church. The church makes no Mich assertion,
: but what it docs say is this : "The church has
I a perfect rierhi to have some spiritual direction
when temporal affairs have anything to do
; with spiritualities."
Rev. Father H. H. Wyman, superior of
I the Paulist Community in California and
| pastor of the oid St.* Mary's Church on
â¢ California and Dupont streets, educated a
I Protestant:
On the whole, I think that this controversy
I is calculated to stipnilate intellectual activity.
| It will help men to think of these great nue's-
I tions, for, after all, there is no man who can
really take sides on any question unless he un
derstands it in all its bearings. It will help
the public at large to obtain a better under
i standing than they have had on certain re-
I ligious <iuestions, end on this account I do not
! regret, but am glad, that this prolonged con
i troversy has been kept up. I for one am not
i anxious to see it stop.
As long as the people take an interest in
I such questions it is well for those who best un
! demand them to give forth their ideas to the
I public.
Americans as a rule do not take a great inter
i cst In religious questions. The fact that these
articles have attracted attention is a prool of
this. All I say is. let them go ahead as lone as
the newspapers are willing to publish what
I they have to say.
The newspapers understand the public pulse
better than controversialists, simply because it
is their business to do so. When the public
gets tired of these questions the newspapers
I will be the first to find it out.
Rev. Dennis F. Nugent, pastor of St.
Rose's Church :
I think a controversy of some kind was al
most unavoidable. You see, it was pretty hard
to sit and listened to the published utterances
: of these people for the past two years. Why,
j the accusations they were constantly making
| against the church and her priests were biood
curdli::g. Ycr no one resented them or offered
to contradict them.
j Rev. John F. Nugent, pastor of St. Bren
dan's Church:
The Catholics were forced into this fight I
regret that the times and public sentiment are
such that a reply to the avalanche hurled on
us is necessary. If things were allowed to go
on unnoticed these people would become un
governable. It would soon reach a stage where
it would be unsafe for a priest to walk the pub
lic streets.
The Archbishop has sanctioned the stand of
father \ orke and is, from what I can learn, in
perfect sympathy with him. We priests of the
diocese are with the Archbishop.
Rbv. Father Thomas McSweeney, pastor
of St. Francis de Sales, the largest Catho
lic Church in Oakland:
As a matter of fact, it can do onlylgood to the
generation growing up that the plain Catholic
uoctrine be placed before the people in a clear
distiuct light. Father Yorke has done this'
and I think he deserves the thanks of every
â  honest man, Catholic and non-Catholjc.
The Rev. A. M. .Russell, pastor of the
Hamilton-square Baptist Church:
My observations in regard to controversies
| are that they usually result in more good than
harm, for if the question controverted is
worthy of public notice the majority of the
thinking population will be quick to see it, a
new interest will be awakened in the study of
the question or questions involved and the out
come will be n material increase of knowledge

PIONEER PHYSICIAN DEAD.
The Earthly Career of Dr. W. A.
Vigoureux Comes to a
Peaceful End.
AT ONE TIME A DRUGGIST.
A Brief Sketch of His Life in This
State During the Early
Days.
Dr. William A. Vigoureux, one of the
pioneer physicians and a highly respected
member of the medical fraternity, died at
his residence, 1609 Turk street, yesterday,
after an illness of three months. " When he
passed away he was surrounded by the
members of his family and a number of
relatives.
Dr. Vigoureux was a native of Gardner,
Ale., and was born October 5, 1831, of
French parents, both of whom were Pari
sians, who in their native city occupied a
high social position. His grandfather and
one of his uncles were prominent as medi
cal men, the former being surgeon on the
staff of Napoleon 1. His parents first set-

tied in Charleston, S. C, where six sons
were born to tham. Subsequently the
family moved to the Kennebec River,
Maine, where the father established a
French colony.
At the age of 13 the subject of this sketch
served an apprenticeship in a drugstore
at Gardner, and then continued his study
of drugs under competent teachers in
Boston. At the asre of 18 he entered the
New York College nf Physicians and Sur
geons, and there made rapid progress.
When the gold fever moved the world
Dr. vigoureuxset sail in a vessel called
the Annie E. Manic bound for the land of
gold. His brother Joseph was part owner
of the cargo. The vessel reached here on
the 4th of November, 1849, and the doctor
having attended to bis brother's interest
in the vessel and cargo started for the
mines, locating in Placerville. where he
remained until July, 1850. He then re
turned to this City to accept a position in
a drugstore.
In 1858 he opened a drugstore on his
own account at Washington and Dupont
streets, where he remained for about three
years and then moved to Sutter and Mont
gomery streets. He took a course of medi
cine in the Toland Medical College and
after graduation followed the profession of
physician.
In 1856 the doctor was an active mem
ber of the Vigilance Committee. He was
identified with the Sanitary Commission.
He was at one time a member of the Wash
ington Guard and at another time was
surgeon for the San Francisco Hussars.
He was a member of the Masons and the
Odd Fellows.
He was charitable, generous and devoted
to the State and did much to advance its
progress. He leaves a young widow, one
son and many friends to mourn his loss.
TO FIGHT THE NOE HEIRS.
Two Large Clubs at Fairmount
Will Join in the Con
test.
The Suit by the Williams Heirs Will
Be Abandoned To-Day in the
Superior Court.
There is great rejoicing among a large
number oi the property-owners in what is
known as the Fairmount district. About
a year ago an action was begun in the Su
perior Court by the Williams heirs to eject
the property-owners of about ten blocks
upon the ground that they held property
which really belonged to the Williams
heirs.
For a time it looked as though a large
number of people would be driven out of
the homes they had worked so hard to
secure, and all because of a flaw in the
original title deeds. However, they de
termined to contest the suit and for this
purpose formed the Fairmount Defense
Club. The case dragged along for twelve
months, and the oilier day there was a
conference among the attorneys which re
sulted in the representative of the plaintiffs
stating that to-day be would cause the
case to be dismissed.
These facts were made public last even
ing at the meeting of the Fairmount De
fense Club, and. as may be expected, it
caused great rejoicing. * It was further
stated that there were several reasons wliv
the ca^e was abandoned. In the first
place, the attorney said the plaintiffs have
left the State and failed to provide him
with money to carry on the suit. Second,
all the Williams heirs are not represented
in the case, and last, it has been found
that the statute of limitations acts as a bar
in this case. It seems that after the
youngest heir came of age too long a time
was allowed to elapse before setting up a
claim to the property in question.
A committee consisting, of Charles H.
Baker, E. A. Herman, W. R. Robertson
and A. Klahn was appointed to represent
the club when the case is disposed of to
day in the Superior Court.
W. B. Curtis and W. J. Nixon, repre
senting the San Miguel Defense Associa
tion, were present and earnestly urged the
members of the club to join the associa
tion. They explained the nature of the
suit brought by the Noe heirs to recover
4443 acres of the old San Miguel Rancho.
This action is similar in many respects to
the Williams contest and the'land in con
troversy extends from Fifteenth street,
west of Valencia, south to the County line.
In it there are about 6000 holdings.
The delegates explained that the pur
pose was to co-operate and raise sufficient
money to fight the Noes to the bitter end.
After discussing the case at length it was
decided to ur^e all members of the Fair
mount Defense Club to join the San Mi
guel Defense Association. While the
members of the former club have juat got
out of one suit the Noe heirs have thrown
them into another one that also threatens
to deprive them of their homes.
As soon as the meeting adjourned about
half of those present joined the San Mi
guel Defense Association and deposited
the required subscription. Within a fen
days it is expected that the two defense
clubs will be merged into one.
Died From Debility.
A drunken man was arrested on Kearny
street Monday afternoon by Policeman Freel
and taken to the California-street station. He
gave the name of E. Allard, stf years of age,
born in Canada, and a miner by occupation.
When removed to the City Prison that evening
he appeared so weak that Sergeant Bidwell
sent him to the Receiving Hospital. There
he gave his name as A. Darshan. He died la.-t
night, and the cause was registered as debility.

because of some lit-

do nothing at all. He isn't capable of con-
tinuous and vigorous effort. His bodily dis-
comfort affects his mind. Even when he
knows just what is the matter, he neglects
the simplest precautions and the simple
treatment that would cure him. Most of
dyspepsia starts with constipation, and con-
stipation can be cured. Constipation is the
cause of nine -tenths of all human sick-
ness; Some of its symptoms are sick and
bilious headache, dizziness, sour stomach,
loss of appetite, foul breath, windy belch-
ings, heartburn, pain and distress after eat-
ing. All these are indicative of derange-
ments of the liver, stomach and bowels,
and all are caused by constipation. Dr.
Pierce Pleasant Pellets are the quickest,
easiest and most certain cure for this condi-
tion. They are quick, but not violent in
their action. There is nothing about them '
that will give the system any shock. They
pot only relieve immediately, but if taken â¢
according to directions, they will absolutely
cure. You do not become a slave to their
use." They are different and better than
any other pill or preparation offered for the
same purpose. ; Almost all druggists under-
stand this, and are conscientious enough to
tell you so. The druggist who tries to sell
you a substitute is not : a safe man from
whom to buy medicine. If you will send
