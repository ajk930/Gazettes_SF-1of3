4 LINCOLN, Nhbb., May 12.â With a wind
whicd attained a velocity of eighty miles
an hour, continuing for fully five minutes,
Lincoln was this evening given the worst
shaking up experienced for many years.
The force of the gale was terrific, and all
that was needed to make a genuine cyclone
was the rotary motion. As it was, tne
damage in the city was considerable and
there was a number of casualties. Those
most seriously injured are: Mrs. H.
Moore, thrown against a fence, arm broken
and head hurt; J. Jacobson, hackman,
blown from back, bad cut on arm, head
bruised ; A. L. Woodward, struck by de
tached roof, injured internally; Mrs.
Harry Ebbott, blown from buggy, badly
bru:sed. There was also a number of
minor casualties.
In the heart of the business district the
Walton block was unroofed and part of
one wall blown down. The force of the
wind carried heavy pieces of timber
across Ninth street, one crashing through
the west window of the State Journal
counting-room. The Merchants' Hotel
was unroofed, windowlights blown in and
the entire house flooded by the rain that
followed. Roofs on private dwellings
were torn off almost without number,
trees uprooted or broken down and fences
leveled. The electric plant at the hospital
for the insane was blown down and a
Catholic mission church near the city
limits totally demolished. The wires are
down and reports from country districts
are meager.
TEO DISTINGT CYCLONES
Grmt Damage at vmalta and Neighbor
ing ' Towns. '-
OMAHA, Nebk., May 12.â Two sepa
rate and distinct cyclones visited the
towns of Elkhorn and Bennington in this
county late this afternoon, and owine to
the fact that communication is practically
shut off it is impossible to determine to
what extent damage was done, but no loss
of life has so far been reported.
The funnel-shaped clouds appeared be
tween the hours of '6 and 5 o'clock, fol
lowing each other with only a short inter
val. The paths of the cyclones were only
about 600 feet in width, but were swept
clean, the wind cutting through groves of
large trees and tearing them up by the
root?. Farmhouses were demolished and
the loss of stock was heavy.
The summer mansion of Hon. A. S.
Poppleton at Elkhorn had a narrow es
cape, a well-curb close by the house being
wholly demolished, but the building itself
was not touched. E. A. Johnson of Omaha
was driving a team and leading another
team. The wind made kindling-wood of
his carriage and tore the harness off the
horses, and stripped him of most of his
clothing. He escaped with severe bruises.
Dispatches from Crete state that a small
cyclone visited that section of the country
and did great damage to buildings. In
Omaha traffic was at a standstill for over
two honrs and the streets ran great rivers
of water. Lightning struck Cudaby's
packing-house at South Omaha.
AT COUNCIL BLUFFS
.
th* Telegraph HirÂ«7i
COUNCIL BLUFFS, lowa, May 12.â One
of the heaviest rainstorms experienced
here for years occurred this afternoon be
tween 4 and 6 o'clock. High winds ac
companied the downpour and did consid
erable damage. On lower Broadway one
of the 150-foot electric light towers was
blown over. It fell toward the east along
the sidewalk, bat no one was injured. The
rain was coming down in torrents at the
time and the streets were deserted. In its
fall the tower struck the main wires of the
Western Union, completely wrecking them
and cutting off all communication. A
large gang of men was soon at work, but
the lines were not in place at a late hoar
to-night.
The storm to-day was preceded by one of
almost equal violence yesterday afternoon.
On both occasions the streets were flooded
and considerable paving washed out. This
afternoon's storm was accompanied by a
h-avy hailstorm, and considerable damage
was done to growing crops and small fruits.

Several Counties.
WICHITA, Kakb., May 12.â Rice County
was visited by a cyclone late last night,
which resulted in considerable damage to
property, and came n ear causing several
deaths. Upward of a half dozen farm
houses were partly demolished. Several
bams were completely wrecked and miles
of wire fence was destroyed. The course
of the cyclone was from southeast to
no.-thwest, and it swept over a portion of
McPherson County, doing some damage
there. No loss of life has been reported,
but one house was twisted entirely around
and one of its occupants thrown out of a
window, sustaining slight injuries.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., May 12.â A
disastrous wind, rate and hailstorm visited
this section this afternoon, accompanied
by lightning and thnnder. Houses were
unroofed and flooded and in several in
stances struck by lightning. The streets
were turned into rivers, and men, women
and children were badly frightened, some
narrowly escaping with their lives. The
wind was almost a cyclone. The damage
is heavy.

SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, MAY 13, 1896.
lican County Convention ended to-night
what is generally conceded to be the most
disgracefully conducted political conven
tion in the history of the State. It was a
contest between two factions seeking local
supremacy and State party control for the
fall campaign.
The session last night ended at 3 o'clock
in the morning, having made little prog
ress. Ribald songs, speeches by drunken
men urged on by the noisy assembly, and
personal encounters added to the confu
sion of the exciting contest waged upon
every point. The gang element evidently
seemed determined to so disgust the
women voters by their conduct that they
will hereafter remain away from political
meetings.
The convention reassembled at S o'clock
this afternoon to hear reports of the com
mittee named last night to select delegates
to the Congressional and State conven
tions. Against protests formally made
the report was adopted, and contesting
delegations gave notice that they will
appeal to the two conventions. The com
mittee on resolutions were engaged all
day in preparing a report, the convention
adjourning until evening to receive it.
The contest between friends of Senators
Wolcott and Teller has been waged in this
convention and the fight is extremely bit
ter.
The committee on resolutions had a
hard struggle with opposing factions be
fore a final report was adopted and pre
sented to the convention at a late hour.
The resolutions declare for silver and
express full accord with Senator Teller in
his declaration that the monetary ques
tion is paramount. The delegates are in
structed to support no one but those in
full accord with these views. The admin
istration of Governor Mclntyre is in
dorsed and Populism denounced. Senator
Wolcott is ignored.
A resolution was offered by a delegate
as an amendment condemning Senator
Wolcott. Its reading was greeted with
tumultuous cheering. A. rollcall on this
amendment was demanded, resulting in
its defeat by a vote of 377 to 172.
Further amendments were shut off by
the adoption of the previous question.
FILLET IS SUCCESSFUL.
Kerens Men Routed in the Missouri
Convention.
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., May 12.â The Repub
lican State Convention to-day was an in
spiring spectacle. The rivalry between
the Filley and Kerens factions led to in
numerable free fights during the forenoon
and culminated in an attempt, which was
almost successful, by the Kerens men to
keep the Filleyites out of the hall alto
gether.
At 12 :15 o'clock Chauncey L. Filley suc
ceeded in gaining an entrance to the opera
house. He was chagrined to and that he
had been preceded by Hon. R. C. Kerens,
Nathan Frank, J. J. Bittinger, Marshall
McDonald and others of the anti-Filley
ites. who made their entrance through
the alley in the rear.
Shortly afterward the delegates began
filing in, and the numb.er of bloody noses
and black eyes gave evidence of the â¢

SACRAMENTO.
[Sketched yesterday by a " Call" atnff artiit ]
numerous conflicts on tae ontside during
the three hours during which they had
waited for the doors to open. So much
confusion ensued in searching for seats
that it was not until 1 :15 o'clock that
Chairman Filley grasped the gavel and
called the convention to order. He made
a short address for harmony, after which
Rev. Mr. Sherman invoked divine blessing
upon the proceedings. During the prayer
the uproar was so great that it was im
possible to bear the minister's words ten
feet from the stage.
Hon. Richard Bartholdt of St. Louis
was named as temporary chairman and
John Giftin as secretary.
Mr. Bartholdt made a speech in accept
ing the chair, at the conclusion oi which
the St. Louis contesting delegation at
tempted to secure control of the conven
tion by filibustering, but were promptly
sat down on by the chairman, who an
nounced that no motions except that of
selection of the committee on temporary
organization, credentials and resolutions
would be entertained. After a hot fight
by Buchanan, delegates who worked under
the direction of the Kerens faction, the
Filley ites triumphed and bis committees
were chosen. An adjournment was theu
taken until 7 r. h. to give the committees
time to report.
At the night session the committee on
credentials seated the entire Filley dele
gates in the contested districts. The tem
porary organization was made permanent,
and from that time the work was more
pleasant as the Kerens faction laid down
their arms. The platform favors protec
tion and reciprocity and says:
"We are firm and emphatic in our de
mand for honest money. We favor the
use of silver as currency, but to the extent
only and under such regulations that its
parity with the present gold standard can
be maintained, and in consequence we are
opposed to the free, unlimited and inde
pendent coinage of silver at a ratio of 16
tol.
"We recognize the Hon. William Mc-
Kinley as the champion of the doctrine of
protection, a gallant soldier, an able states
man and a true and loyal American, and
the delegates elected by this convention
are directed to cast their votes for William
McKinley for President of the United
States."
It was 1:25 when the first candidate for
delegate to the National Convention was
nominated in the person of Chauncey I.
Filley, who was nominated by acclama
tion amid a perfect tumult.
To add to the honor conferred upon him,
he was also unanimously elected chair
man of the State Central Committee.

Republicans at the recent primaries.
The minority report was laid on the
table and the majority report was adopted.
After the rejection of the minority re
port the anti-Addicks men left the con
vention amid much excitement. The
convention then selected delegates to take
the place of the bolters, and chose dele

PLANKS IN THE PLATFORM.
Considerable Argument Before the
Committee Relating to the
Taiiff Question.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 12^-The
Populists have proved that they are work
ingmen and that their convention is their
workshop by the earnestness which they
have displayed in the proceedings. But
they have made haste slowly. The re
sult of the day's effort from 10 in the
morning until near midnight was a tern*
porary set of officers ana the usual num
ber of committees, only one of which, on
credentials, reported.
The chairman, C. A. Barlow of San Luis
Obispo, has not met with any objection
from either the A. P. A. element or the
other element which is opposed to
mingling religion with politics. Mr.
Barlow acquitted himself very well indeed.
He handled the gavel with the same deft
ness of touch and the same brilliancy of
technique as that displayed by Paderewski
or Ysaye on their favorite instruments.
He is well acquainted with the members
and by the aid of the cards showing the
names of the counties from which they
hailed or thundered, as the case may be,
he managed to introduce them properiy
to the rest of the delegates. Those same
printed cards by the way, are an ortho
graphical curiosity. Solano is spelled
Salano, Madera is converted into Madara,
Tehama is made to read Tahama, and
many of the other counties have been
sadly disfigured in a similar way by a
printer who seems to be greatly in want of
a little red school house as part of his lit*
erary apparatus.
Populists are not dunces, and to-day
many of the cards were taken away for re
pairs and returned with the names of the
counties properly spelled in Spencerian
script. The committee on platform bad a
hard time of it.
They went out shortly after noon and
spent the recess till 4 o'clock in fitting ut>
a platform to lit the local conditions and
at the same time to be in harmony with
the Omaha platform. The session of this
committee developed the fault that there
are a laree number of orators gathered to
gethei and discord and procrastination are
in the midst of them.
The tariff question, brought out by a
plank submitted by Mr. Cator, started the
ball rolling and kept it rolling up to an
extremely unpopulistically late hour. The
Omaha platform has deftly straddled the
tariff proposition and Mr. Cator endeav
ored to have the straddle removed and to
induce the party in California to say
something on the matter.
Murphy of Shasta, the protege of Sheriff
Houston of that county, one of three
Sheriffs in this State elected on the
straight Populist ticket, made a bitter
fight against the Cator resolution and was
assisted by J. V. Webster, ex-Popu!ist
nominee for Governor, and Cator was ably
supported by Burnette G. Haskell of San
Francisco and L. F. Smith of Santa Clara.
But it was so much time wasted, for the
battle may have to be fought over again
to-morrow on the floor of the convention.
The State Central Committee occupied
the recess hours and worried away late in
the evening over the subject of raising the
wherewithal to carry on the campaign and
to help elect the legislative ticket. Several
propositions were made in the executive
session, one of them being for each county
to assess its Populist resident! 50 cents or
$1 apiece.
It was estimated that not less than
$ 10,000 would be required and that $50,000
would come nearer satisfying the require
ments of the campaign. Some dissatisfac
tion was expressed by several members of
the committee as to the manner in which
Secretary Bush had handled the finances.
They thought that more economy should
be practiced.
Not much interest is being taken in the
matter of the nomination of a Lieutecant-
Governor. T. W. H. Shanahan of Shasta
and Douglass T. Foster of Fresno are most
spoken of, but Sheriff Houston of Shasta
said last night that Mr. Shanahan was not
a candidate for any office under the sun.
Fowler has many friends. He has great
force of character and can handle a con
vention with the skill of a veteran.
The Congressional tight in Grove L.
Johnson's district is attracting some at
tention. Some of ex-Attorney-General
A. L. Hart's friends are working quietly
to have him nominated. Hart himself
says nothing, but laughs and shakes his
curled locks when the subject is men
tioned. He is said to be a deadly political
enemy of Grove L. Johnson, and his
friends claim that if nominated he would
roast Johnson in every precinct in the dis
trict on his funding bill record.
The convention wil 1 reassemble at 9
o'clock to-morrow morning. The Second
Congressional District convention will
meet at half-past 7 in the morning, an
hour which only a granger would suggest.
Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. A. A. Sargent,
Ida A. Harper and Mrs. Kobart, of the
Woman Suffrage Association, made ring
ing speeches to the convention and were
warmly received. Mrs. Elizabeth Pur
nell, formerly a schoolteacher in this city
and a woman of varied intellectual attain
ments, made one of the best speeches o l
the day.
BUSINESS IS BEGUN.
Charles A. Barlow of San Luis Obispo
Chosen Chairman of the
Convention.
BACRAMENTO. Cal., May 12,â 1t wai
10:20 a. M. when Chairman E. M. Wardall
of the State Central Committee called the2
Populists' convention to order in the As
sembly chamber. He called on Rev. W.
C. Bowman to invoke a blessing before the
regular proceedings were opened. In the
course of his prayer the minister said:
"We feel that this is a convention of
men and women to promote a cause that
has the approval of God and heaven. We
feel that this movement was born of God
and baptized with the breath of heaven in
its very inception."
In bis opening address the chairman
spoke as follows:
"We are now at a point where we can
see victory in the air. We now invite your
â wise counsel, and I feel sure, from its per
sonnel, that this convention will be long
remembered for the good work it will do.
"A weeK ago there was another State
Convention in this city, and I have no
hesitancy in saving that the Republican
convention, which then met, did more for
us than for itself. [Applause.] It seems
to me that its action was such as not to
meet with the unqualified approval of the
Republicans.
"It placed an anti-funding plank in the
platform and. then placed at the bead of
its electoral ticket Charles F. Crocker, vice
president of the Southern Pacific Com
pany; and then a man, notoriously a rail
road man, the Congressman from this dis
trictâl allude, of course, to Mr. Johnson
was also placed on the electoral ticket of
that party.
"We have also reason to doubt the work
of the Republican party during the last
two years. Two years ago the Repub
lican party, as it did a week ago, adopted
a suffrage plank. They opened the cam
paign in Los Angeles. They came out
without any excuse and repudiated the
action of the State convention, saying they
would not support the woman suffrage
plank.
"We have now 70,000 votes pledged in
the Populist party to that cause because
the campaign has begun. , Then the Pro
hibition party has at least 10,000 more
votes and tney can be relied on to join us
in this matter. If we can drum up 20,000
more out ot the Republican and Demo
cratic parties the woman suffrage amend
ment will be carried by a big majority."
Assistant Secretary Hamilton then read
the call for the convention.
J. A. Johnson of San Francisco, with an
eye cast to the rear of the hall, called
attention to the presence of Miss Susan B.
Anthony, Mrs. Aaron A. Sarcent and Miss
Harper, of the Woman Suffrage Associa
tion, in the rear of the hall, and moved
that those ladies be invited to take seats
in front of the platform. The convention
showed its appreciation of the doctrine of
equal suffrage by rising to its feet and
adopting the motion by acclamation.
George D. Glllespie of Sun Francisco, a
young man nattily dressed and holding a
silk hat in his hand, proposed three cheers
for the ladies, and as they passed through
the middle aisle toward the front of tne
ball, escorted by tbe smiling J. A. Johnson,
the hall rang and rang again with cheer
ing.
Nominations for temporary chairman
were declared in order, and were
opened by J. F. McSwain of Alameda, a
gentleman attired in sober black, illumi
nated with a w&ite tie, who named Dr. C.
H. Castle of Merced.
J. V. Webster, ex-candidate for Governor
on the Populist ticket, placed Charles A. j
Barlow oi San Luis Obispo in nomination,
garlanded with flowers of praise. He said i
that Mr. Barlow had never slunk away
from duty. He had stood before the
mouth of a bursting cannon and had aided
in scattering its fragments to the four
winds of heaven. He had faithfully
served the people on the floor of the
Assembly and had redeemed every pledge
that he had made to the people. More
than that, Mr. Barlow had come to the
convention without any indorsement from
any other party. He cams from the
People's party and none other.
J. D. Thompson of San Francisco and J.
"Way bright of El Dorado seconded the
nomination of Barlow.
E. S. Van Meter of Fresno named D. T.
Fowler of Fresno.
J. M. C. Murphy of Shasta nominated
Joseph E. Bell of Shasta.
Rev. W. C. Bowman of Los Angeles
seconded Mr. Barlow's nomination, and
the vote was called with the following

The motion was carried by a rising vote
and Burdette Cornell, the Populist orator'

desk.
She was received with that cordial wel

tion of thinking men. Every one of the
delegates looked as though he did his o*vn
thinking. Most men do their thinking as
the Yankee family did their washing â
they put it out of the family and had it
done â but the Pouulists did their own
thinking instead of letting somebody else
do it for them.
She spoke of Mrs. Aaron A. Sargent,
widow of the late United States Senator of
tliat name, and Mrs. Sarah Knox Good
rich as being true friends of the cause on
this coast. The friends of suffrage pro
pose to present a petition signed by 50,000
men and women to the Democratic State
Convention on June 16 in favor of woman
suffrage. Statistics were quoted by the
speaker to show that women Daid one
eleventh of all of the money received
from taxes in this KtaÂ»e outside of San
Francisco, there not having been any com
putation made of the tax roll of that City.
She told also of the women of Colorado
and Wyoming and how they always voted
on the side of right and morality.
Mrs. Sargent and Mrs. Goodrich made
brief speeches, which were applauded to
the echo.
Miss Ida A. Harper, chairman of the
woman suffrage press committee, made
her maiden speech to a convention of
men. She called attention to the favor
able attitude of the press of this State on
the subject of equal suffrage. Of the 1300
press clippings sent to her by a bureau
there were only twenty-five opposed to
woman suffrage.
'â¢We propose to keep this matter non
partisan." she went on, "and will not
allow this cause to be dragged into any
religious controversy if it is in our power
to prevent it." ,
This declaration was received with much
enthusiasm.
Mrs. Sarah Pnrnell of Sacramento was
the next speaker, and although a stranger
to the majority of the delegates, was
warmly greeted. She captured the hearts
of her hearers by remarking that there
was in this convention more tweed and
less broadcloth than she observed in the
Republican convention last week, and
pondering upon the contrast she had said
to herself that if she could vote she would
vote for the Populist 3. She mentioned a
painful reminiscence pertaining to her
self
"Two years ago," she said, "I was so un
fortunate at the time of the great railroad
strike in this State as to write some articles
and thereby to tread on somebody's corns.
That party being a power brought his guns
to bear on me and finally succeeded in
brineing me down, so that I am to a cer
tain extent, a political martyr." y
Mrs. Purnell's reference was to the fact
that after she had written those articles in
favor of the strikers she was dismissed
from her position in the Sacramento
school department by the Board of Edu
cation of this city.
Mrs. Hobart followed by congratulating
Miss Anthony as being one of the most
splendid examples of .heroism and endu
rance in advocacy of the principles of
woman suffrage. She spoke of equal wages
for women and men for equal service, and
said that 55 per cent of the women of this
Nation to-day were forced to go out of
their homes to work to assist their hus
bands.
After an hour pleasantly spent in this
way the committee on credentials ap
peared with their report, ana the work of
the convention proceeded.
In the Santa Barbara contest the com
mittee reporied, excluding W. B. Gray of
the regulars and J. Bradley and R. H.
Fulweilerof the contestants. They seated
J. Morgan, A. M. Powell and J. A. Wilcox
of the regulars and J. W. Starkweather of
the contestants. Starkweather was one of
the first, if not the first, delegate to arrive
in Sacramento, and the result of his work
shows that he had well employed his time
among the delegates in pleading his cause.
Randolph of Alameda moved to refer
the list of the Alameda delegates back to
the committee for the reason that one of
the delegates was an office-holder and
under the rules of the People's party could
not sit in a Populist Convention.
The delegate referred to is Burdette Cor
nell, the noted Populist orator, who holds
the position of Deputy Treasurer of Ala
meda County. One of the delegation said
(bat Mr. Cornell had been wording for one
week in the Treasurer's office, and that at
tue end of the month he would receive his

Characteristic View of Some Populist Gripsacks at Sacramento
pay. He had not received his commission,
but he would receive it as soon as he got
back to Alameda, and Mr. Cornell made a
speech, in wiiieh he offered to withdraw if
tliere was any delegate present who ob
jected to his taking a seat.
He was followed by E. S. Van Meter of
Fresno, who contended that as Mr. Cornell
was to be paid out of the private funds of
the Treasurer, and that as he had not yet
received his commission, he was as much
entitled to sit in the convention as any
other delegate on the floor.
A long discussion followed, in which the
speakers contended that Mr. Cornell should
be seated, as he was not in the employ of
the municipal body.
"All in favor of the motion to adopt the
report of the committee and seat Mr. Cor
nel! will please give the voting sign of the
order," said Chairman Barlow.
A roar of laughter greeted this lapse
into the friendly realms of fraternal order,
and the chairman remarked that he
hoped that the convention would excuse
him.
The report of the committee was adopted
and Mr. Cornell was seated.
It was announced that thecommittee on
permanent organization ana order of busi
ness and on platform had not yet com
pleted their labors, and ttiat no further
business could be done until that time.
An adjournment was had until 9 o'clock
to-morrow morning.
BUILDING A PLATFORM
Anti-Funding and Tariff Planks Cause
Much Argument Before the Com
mittee.
SACRAMENTO, Cal,, May 12. â For
four hours and a half the committee on
resolutions and platform labored assidu
ously this afternoon on the task of build
ing up a platform that wouid not only
meet the demands of the adherents of the
party throughout the State and country,
but would also attract the malcontents in
the two great political parties.
The twenty-one members of the commit
tee began their session at 1 :30 p. m. and ad
journed at 6 o'clock to meet again at 7:15,
after adopting but four planks for recom
mendation to the National Convention
and without having dono a single thing
toward formins a plauk or platform of
strictly State intereÃt.
Every proposition brought forward
s*rved as an excuse for the release of a
flow of oratory from most of the mem
bers, even when it was a foregone conclu
sion that the proposition had the approval
of a majority. But when the tariff ques
tion came up a regular Niagara of words
overwhelmed the session and was main
tained so incessantly that, in the very
midst of the discussion, some one, out of
sheer pity for the committee, moved a re
cess for an hour and a quarter.,.
This was the one question on which any
great diversity of opinion was develo ed,
the opposition element strongly favoring
a course entirely ignoring the issue.
The first motion was one to indorse and
reaffirm the Omaha platform. To this an
amendment was made by T. V. Cator, fa
voring d rect legislation.
H. C. Dillon of Los Angeles then sprang
as a substitute one of the planks of a cut
and dried platform which he had been
carefully nursinp, as be confessed, for
some weeks, and which he shielded most
stringently from the knowledge and scru
tiny of every one, evidently in fear of a
blighting frost. As events developed,
however, he might almost as well have ex
posed it to every possible danger, for it was
doomed to such a course of amputation
that only one small paragraph served as a
sort of graft to the platform that was
ultimately adopted.
His amendment provided for swallow
ing in their entirety and with all their in
consistencies the four platform? adopted
at Ocala, St. Louis, Cinciunati and Omaha.
This was killed.
JohnÂ«on followed to amend by adding a
provision for proportional representation.
A suggestion was made to incorporate
the initiative and referendum in the plank
which was accented by Mr. Cator, and as
adopted the first plank reads:
"The People's party of the State of Cal
ifornia reaffirm the principles of the
Omaha platform and demand direct legis
lation by the initiative and referendum
and proportional representation."
Judge Dillon then offered another of his
choice collection of planks, reading:
"We demand that direct legislation and
proportional representation be guaranteed
to the people whenever a petition signed
by 10 per cent of the voters of any State,
county or municipality therein shall ask
for the same."
After this had been amended until it
was unrecognizable as the original reso
lution, Mr. Cator moved that the subject
be laid aside until all declarations on
National matters had been disposed of.
This carried, and Mr. Cator then intro
duced t lie following anti-bond resolution:
"We denounce the policy and practice of
the Democratic an>! Republican parties in
maintaining the gold standard and in is
suing bonds to purchase gold to pay Na
tional obligations which are on their face
and by law payable either in gold or silver
coin, and condemn the hypocrisy of the
Republican party for denouncing Grover
Cleveland for so issuing bonds, while it
has by its representatives in Congress up
held the said policy and has refused to
vole for bills brought in by Populist Sen
ators to restrain the issue of such bonds
without the caosent of Congress."
In tin- discVd&fon that ensued one of the
members wanted the bond-issuine policy
denounced as a conspiracy between the
Democratic administration and money
brokers and bankers of Wall street and
England to enslave the people finan
cially.
Objection was successfully made to this
proposition by the argument that it would
be impossible to legally prove the exist
ence of such a conspiracy and that the
People's party ought not to make declara
tions that it was not in a position to prove.
Then tne irrepressible Dillon threw an
other one ot his planks into the arena, but
no one deigned to take hold of it and it
got irrecoverably lost in the shuffle of
words and amendments that followed.
Mr. Gator's resolution was adopted.
Undismayed by defeat, Mr. Dillon again
tore off another plank from his now some
what dismantled platform and submitted
it to the committee. It was- one that
brought a plad smile to some and a grim
smile to many. This is it:
"We demand that whenever a monopoly
becomes oppressive it shall be taken
possession of and owned and operated in
the interest of the people, just remunera
tion being first made for the property
taken. Among such monopolies we spe
cifically point to the Central and Union
Pacific railroads and, condemning the
funding bill now pending in Congress, we
demand that the Government take imme
diate steps for the ownership and control
of those public highways and that they be
operated in the interests of the whole peo
ple and not in the interests of other con
necting lines."
Despite the strong language in which
this vaÂ« couched, it did not meet with the
apparent deep feeling of hatred enter
tained toward the great monopoly,
more particularly the latter paragraph,
beginning: "Among such monopolies we
specifically point to tne Central and Union
Pacific," etc.
This entire paragraph was finally killed
to clear the deck for a stronger and more
sweeping measure against funding and in
favor of Government ownership and opera
tion of the roads named.
This done. Judge Dillon was gladdened
by the adoption of the first paragraph.
Cator was on the alert, and by the time
the anti-monopoly plank was disposed of
he was ready with and presented the fol
lowing to cover the question of funding
and Government ownership, as during the
earlier discussion it was declared that no
resolution could be too strong:
"We oppose and denounce all bills to
fund or extend the payment of the Pacific
railroad debts, and we oppose any settle
ment by which these roads are to" remain
in the hands of any private person or cor
poration unless these debts are paid in full
and at maturity, and unless so paid we
demand that the Government, by virtue
of the terms of its mortgage, enter into and
take possession of these roads and operate
the same as National enterprises in the
interests of the people; and upon fore
closure, if there is a deficiency, that the
Government pursue every legal or equita
ble remedy to recover any such deficiency
from those responsible therefor."
Little discussion was created by this and
it was soon made a plank of the platform
to be submitted to-morrow to the main
convention.
At this point Cator threw what proved
to be the apple of discord into the assem
blage with this artistic and artful straddle
of the tariff question :
"We favor genuine protection to Ameri
can labor by the restriction of the immigra
tion of foreign labor and by a true Ameri
can system of finance which will render
justice to labor und industry and restrain
the evils of usury, and we demand the
creation of a National non-partisan tariff
tribunal of experts to the end that all
revenues derived from tariff shall be so
adjusted thai, the benefit shall result to
labor and not to the trusts, and we de
nounce the Democra'ic and Republican
parties for refusing to properly restrict
immigration of foreign labor when having
the power to do so in Congress."
Thines were going along swimmingly
and it looked as if the planK would re
ceive the unanimous approval of the com
mittee, when Murphy of Shasta, calling
attention with due modesty and defer
ence to the fact that he was young in
years and inexperienced in polities,
startled bis colleagues by declaring that
the adoption ot the Cator tariff plank
would mean con pie te defeat of the party.
He continued:
"Why, gentlemen, for years my friend
Mr. Ditmar and I nave been telling our
people that the tariff was no longer an
important issue befere the people of this
country, but that the financial Question
was the one of paramount interest. We
pointed out to them that neither Republi
can protection nor Democratic free trade
had enabled them to pay off their mort
gages, bny a new bat or a new suit uf
clothes, and we further assured them that
when the financial system of our country
was reformed on the lines we favor that
they would no longer wear patches on
their pjÂ»nts. Now you would compel us to
go before the people and explain to them
that we were wrong and the tariff is an
issue and an important one. I tell you,
gentlemen, if this plank is adopted I will
KUIUc uv v, uui 1 >iiuu ugiii ib on LUC uuur
of the convention."
This encouraged others to oppose the
resolution, and while the debate was at
its height, the fond father of the only plat
form that was born complete, with every
plank fully grown and developed, offered
up another of its planks for sacrifice, evi
dently mistaking the humor of the com
mittee. It was as follows:
"Recognizing the fact that a tariff is a
tax on what we consume, and is in the
end paid by the consumerâ that it is a
scheme devised by wealth-owners to im
pose on wealth-producers the burden of
supporting the Government--we demand
that an import duty be assessed at so high
a rate on all goods that can be produced in
this country in sufficient quantities to
meet the demands of trade, as to abso
lutely prohibit their importation, and that
all goods that cannot be so produced in
this country be admitted free of duty ; and
that the funds necessary for the support of
the Government be raised by a graduated
income tax, a succession tax, and such
other direct taxation as may be found to
be less oppressive."
It was proposed as a substitute, but
after it had been pretty well splintered its
sponser withdrew its remains.
There was no diminution, however, in
the volume and intensity of the debate,
the question being whether to straddle by
the adoption of the tariff tribunal proposi
tion or to ignore the question altogether.

Those who advocated the latter course
declared that the party had gathered
strength in the past by totally ignoring
the tariff, and prophesied that a similar
policy now would result advantageously.
At this Caior declared that if there was
nothing in the Omaha platform on the
tariff he would be pleased to withdraw hia
resolution. He produced a copy of this
much-referred- to but apparently little
known docum nt, and read section D of
the finance plank, as follows .
"We believe that the money of the coun
try should be kept as much as possible in
the hands of the people, and hence we de
mand that all National and State revenues
shall be limited to the necessary expenses
of the Government, economically and hon
estly administered."
He then continued :
"Here we have a declaration on the sub
ject, and one that has always, so I am in
formed, been interpreted as favoring the
Democratic idea of creating a tariff for
creating a revenue to carry on the Govern
ment, economically and honestly adminis
tered."
He urged the adoption of his resolution,
as, he said, both Democrats and Republic
ans would be attracted to the Populist
party, as his resolution would virtually
take the tariff question out of politics.
Objection was taken to his interpreta
tion of the Omaha plank he had read, the
claim being made that it did not cover the
tariff issue or touch that question at all.
Mr. Cator at this juncture evolved a new
and interesting issue by asking Chairman
D. T. Fowler of Fresno to call the roil, in
order to get an expression from the com
mittee as to whether or not the Omaha
platform dealt with the tariff issue.
It was then 6 p. m., and one member suf
fering from the pangs of hunger begged
i for adjournment pending the discussion
and vote on this question, and a recess
was taken until 7:15 p. m.
After a protracted discussion Mr. Cator
announced that be tooK the ground that
the tariff question was referred to in the
Omaha platform, and the question was
put to the committee by Chairman Fowler
in this form: "Is there any reference to
the tariff question in the Omaha plat
form?"
On the call of the roll there were sixteen
unqualified ayes, two unqualified noes and
five qualified answers of both kinds. The
qualified ayes were, "Yes, but it does not
deal with the tariff."
The question was accordingly decided in
the affirmative and the discussion began
all over again. Mr. Cator's resolution
was airain before the committee and Mr.
Murphy was again on the floor. He ob
jected strenuously to the tariff part of the
resolution.
He called attention to the fact that the
Populists had fought the old parties on
that i^sue for four years on the lines that
the proper adjustment of the tariff ques
tion was an important matter. The Popu
lists had said that it was not so that the
important questions were those of land,
currency and transportation.
''All our speakers throughout the United
States have said that those are the ques
tions that have forced the old parties and
their representative men to say publicly
that the tariff question is not the great
question before the American people
to-day," continued Mr. Murphy, "and now
we propose in this State Convention to say
how and in what manner we will dispose of
tne tariff question, and I say that it is a
dangerous thing. It puts into the hands of
the old party men a club to beat us over
the beads with. We have to contend with
men who have made deception a study,
and who have skillfully practiced for years
and years the art of pulling wool over the
eyes of the people."
Mr. Murphy went on to argue that the
people could not be educated up to the
new idea in six months.
" Whenever we strike the rock of dealing
with the tariff," he added, "our ship will
go to pieces."
Burnette G. Haskell said that the Cator
resolution, if incorporated into the State
platform, would be the means of winning
to Populism the votes of tens of thousands
of workingmen from the Democratic and
Republican parties. The larger proportion
of the workingmen in this State believe in
protection, and some few of the Democrats
believe in a limited protective tariff.
. "I know that the trades unions to-day
are socialistic," he said, "and they con
demn this plank in the Omaha platform.
If you pass this resolution of Mr. Cator
you will go into the shopa with a double
edged weapon; we can say to the laborer,
'We can protect you by keeping out the
competition of cheap labor,' that will suit
the Republican and the Democrat as well."
Vann of Colusa opposed the Cator reso
lution bitterly. The Populists had accused
both Republicans and Democrats of strad
dling issues in their platforms, and the
Cator resolution made the Populists
straddle the tariff question,
"If Mr. Haskell is a straddler, I am
not," continued Mr. Vann.
"I am a straddler on that proposition,"
retorted Haskell.
"We expect," continued Mr. Vann, "to
catch Democratic and Republican votes
with a straddle platform, in face of the
fact that all the victories have been won by
coming out squarely upon issues straddled
by the oid parties. You interject a tariff
plank here and you admit that every ut
terance of the party for the last four years
is false. Every one of the speakers in favor
of this resolution has said tnat it is sim
ply molasses to catch flies. I, as a man
who helped to organize this party and who
has made more than 100 speeches on the
Omaha platform, beg of you not to inter
ject into that platform any proposition of
a straddling nature."
J. Asbury Johnson of San Francisco
said that the Cator resolution was a buzz
â aw with which Populists should not
monkey if they didn't want to have their
fingers cut off. The tariff commission, he
explained, would be created, undoubtedly,
by act of Congress, and the members
would be elected by the votes of the peo
ple of the States represented by them.
"If we want to get business men with us
we must take a stand on this tariff ques
tion and get into line with the business
men who are trying to take the tariff ques
tion out of politics," said Mr. Johnson.
J. V. Webster condemned the proposi
tion. "It had been admitted by all the
speakers in its favor," he said, "that it was
a straddle proposition without any prin
ciple being involved. Any proposition
that the Republicans and the Democrats
can make appear ridiculous is worse than
no proposition at all. Who would enforce
the decision of the tariff commission in a
Congress comprised of hieh-tanfl mer,
low-tariff men and free-traders?"
L. F. Smith. Â«f Santa Clara warmly in
doK>Â«<* the reso'ution. He asserted tha:
the only issue that had led the Republican
party to victory was that of the tariff, and^
so long as Populists continued to dodga
the main Issue, which was the tariff, the
party could never succeed.
J. L. Diyden of San Diego declared thai

\J law and Notary Public, 638 Market at,, oppo-
site Palace Hotel. Telephone 57a Besldeaos luii'J
, lellw. Telephone, "Pine" 2691. j ""tbe tariff issue had been forced upon the
People's party.
"The Populists," he continued, "were
not to decide the question of high or low
tariff; that was the issue between the
Democratic and Republican parties. All
we propose to do is to stand where they
stand; that a tariff is necessary to sustain
the Government; but we shall leave the
question of high or low to them."
The father of the resolution then again
took up the defense of the plank. He as
serted that it was primarily intended as a
device to get the tariff out of the way
without trouble and discussion, so as to
better brin# the great and, as he termed
it, the prime question of finance before
the people.
"The point," he exclaimed, "is how
shall we best put ourselves in a position to
make this financial question the para
mount one and where we shall not be
both.reil with it at all. No one doubts
that the financial question is the 6ole is-
Mie and that the tariff is simply a fraud
and a blind to thwart the efforts of the
PopuKsts."
Mr: Murphy moved that the clause re
ferring to the tariff tribunal be stricken
out. On rollcall the motion was lost by a
vote of 7 ayeÃ to 14 noes.
The resolution was then adopted and
this action was greeted with enthusiastic
applause.
Judge Dillon took the floor and stated
he had a plank to offer, the first on Btate
matters, which he hoped would not be
hoodooed because it was in his hands.
He then read the following on woman
suffrage:
'â¢We demand the enfranchisement of
women upon the same terms now enjoyed
by men, and to that end pledge our votes
and most earnest efforts to procure the
adoption by the people of this State at the
next general election of the eleventh
amendment to the constitution."
This was promptly adopted.
Cator was to the* front again with the
following economic and drastic measure:
"We d-nand that salaries of tmolic offi
cials, which in many instances remain as
high as in times of prosperity, shall be re
duced in the proportion that prices of
products and property have fallen. We
promise to conduct the government of this
State efficiently upon a tax of 50 cents
uji n the ?100, and we condemn both Re
publican and Democratic administrations
in this State for having broken their plat
form pledges in this respect, and for an ex
travagunce whereby almost as much
money is levied to carry on the affairs of
this State as is levied to "conduct the State
government of New York."
Judge Dillon suggested that the resolu
tion include a demand that county offices
be consolidated wherever practicable. The
suggestion was accepted by Mr. Cator, and
the resolution as amended was adopted.
N. J. Manson declared it was time to get
at the Supreme Court of the United States
and then offered the following revolution
ary resolution:
Whereas, Thomas Jefferson held the view
that the whole people alone were the sole de
positors of the ultimate powers of society and
that wah the corruptions of time aud party a
non-eleeiive aud life-tenure judiciary, with

must inevitably result in despotism; therefore,
be it
Resolved, That an amendment, to be known
as amendment 16 (XVI), be added to the con
stitution of the United States, which shall
piainly declare that neither the judiciary of
the United States nor any State shall have the
power to declare any law of Congress to be un
rn:is!itn;ional and void, but such law shall be
subject only to the challenge and veto of the
wh..le people hi accordance with the refer
endum or referring to the people's principle.
Cator seconded the reso ution in an elo
quent address, declaring that the poor
man had to accept the Justice of the
I'eace as his final arbiter, while the pluto
crat in order to knock out the income tax
couid evade the will of the people by ap
peaiing to the few Justices ol the Supreme
Court of the United States.
Dryden compared the Supreme Court to
the Parliament of Loui^ XVI. which made
such laws as the King desired and then
enforced them. It was this, he asserted,
that brought on the reign of terror. In
concluding he said :
"It is time, when 11 is Known that a man
gave $50,000 to the campaign fund with the
understanding that he was to go upon the
tiupwme bench, for us to have a change in
the manner of selecting the Justices of the
Supreme Court of the United States."
Judge Dillon pleaded for respect to the
courts of the country.
Waterhouse of Fresno declared he would
render respect to the courts as they de
served, and not one whit more. He re
ferred to what he denounced as the trial of
Eugene V. Debs by injunction, the annul
ling of the income tax and the action of
the Supreme Court in recently reversing
its own decision, and added:
"I want now to enter our protest against
the court which attempts to do away with
Congre-s and makes that Congress noth
ing more than a delusion, a snare and a
fraud upon tbf> people."
Mr. Welch introduced the following as a
substitute:
"We view with apprehension the en
croachments of the Federal judiciary upon
the liberties of the people as evidenced by
the decisions in the recent contempt and
income-tax cases, and are in favor of an
amendment to the National constitution
prohibiting that tribunal or any other
court from annulling any congressional
ecu"
Further disenssion resulted in the
adoption of the Weich substitute.
B. G. Haskeil introduced the following:
â¢ Resolved, That we condemn the dishonest
action of such Assessors in this State as habitu
ally and corruptly underestimate the values
of the banks, corporations and wealthy classes
01 the commonwealth.
Resolved, That we pledge the People's party
to nominate Assessors who will obey the law,
observe their oaths and assess such properties
in the manner required by the constitution.
We furthermore protest against the collec
tion of the poor man's taxes on personal prop
erty in this State by force," levy and sale with
out process of court; and we pledge ourselves
to repeal the iniquitous statute that permits it,
at tne next meeting of the Legislature.
This was adopted and Mr. Cator then
presented the following:
We invor good roads. The People's party is
pre-eminently the party of public improve
ments, and were its financial demands in
operation ail roads would be made good.
The fcilowing additional resolutions
were adopted :
We favor the support of the free public
school system and oppose public moneys being
uved for any sectarian school.
Kesolved. That we iavor n union of reform
forces at St. Louis on July 22, provided tbat it
can be beneficially effected without tne sacri
fice of the principles of the People's party; we
oppose any proceedings by which the People's
party convention shall sit with or join any
other convention or admit any but the dele
gates elected by the People's Party's National
Convention.
We condemn the legislation of the Govern
ment that permits a vasturmyof its citizens
to beg hopelessly for employment while public
highways and public works are parceled out to
favorite contractors. We demund that all pub
lic work shall be carried on without the inter
vention of contracts, under skilled superin
tendents, and that preference be given in all
buch work to our unemployed citizens.
We favor homes as the true foundation of a
free and happy people, and we further favor an
amendment "to the constitution exempting
property of each head of a family in this State
to the exUnt of $500 from taxation; and we
favor a graduated tax upon land, whereby the
tax ratio of tax shall increase, as the value of
land is greater In a single hand, to the end
that great estates in land may be broken up
and that land monopoly may be destroyed.
On motion of Mr. Welch, Judge Dillon
and Mr. Cator were appointed a committee
to draft a money plank, which is to be pre
sented 10 the main committee at its session
in the morning. Tne sub-committee ap
pointod by the committee on resolutions
to draft a money plank reported as follows :
We are In favor of sound money, and define
the same to consist of gold and silver and the
United Slates notes, full legal tender for a:l
debts, private and public, issued by the Gen
eral Government, without the intervention of
milking corporations, and in volume soffi
lent to transact the business of the country
Â«n a cash basis, and demand the restoration
â¢f silver to the place it occupied before the de
toonetizatiou act of 1873.

following has been prepared by a delegate
of a financial turn of mind and will be in
troduced to-morrow:
Whereas, It is conceded that all party or
ganization is based on methods of intrigue
and indirection; and whereaÃ, that for the
purposes oi developing a higher type of man

Government for and by the people that
they be invited, and that the avenues of
approach to the halls of convention be
cleared of all possible obstruction; and
whereas, platforms are promulgated by the
parties for the purpose of placating the people,
and, in view of the lack of party integrity
their pledges are not kept; and whereas,
wealth and opulence and corporate power tax
themselves and thereby control primaries,
and the octopus, unlawfully and with a view to
bribe, distributes pusses to their delegates, and
whereas, the patronage of the parties is prosti
tuted and subordinate offices of trust are given

SUPPORTS THE SYSTEM
Chairman Barlow Tells of the Advan-
tages Derived From ttie Medium
of Kxchange.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 12.âChair
man Charles A. Barlow of San Luis Obispo
iB one of the most enthusiastic supporters
of the Di Bernardi labor exchange system.
He is employed in the Farmers' Alliance
flouring-mill of San Luis Obispo, and all
the product of the mill is disposed of
through the labor exchange.
"I was one of the strongest opponents to
the idea when it was first broached in our
neighborhood," he said yesterday; "but
its results from the very start were so
satisfactory that all my objections and
j>rpiu(iicpf quickly disappeared.
"Our exchange at Arroyo Grande started
nine monilisago with $04. â  To-day it does
a business of about $7;>u a month and has
a reserve fund or stock of goods worth $75tf.
"But the suecees of the movement at
San Luis Otdspo was much greater. The
labor exchange there was opened two and
a half months ago with about $400. Its
business last month amounted to $160*),
and we shipped two carloads of flour out
of the town.
"We make it a point to encourage all
co-operative enterprises, but decline to
handle any of the product of the flour
milling trust."
"In what way does the producer derive
greater benefit from this system than un
der the more treneral one used by the
world in which money is the medium of
exchange?" was a.sked.
Tnis brought forth a clear and full eluci
dation of tbe scheme in these words:
"In disposing of his produce to the ex
change the rancher is aJlowed the whole
sale price, as shown by the current market
reports; in making his purchases or tak
ine other goods in exchange for those he
has broueht to the exchange he is charged
the retail price. The margin of profit that
results goes to pay the expenses of run
ning the exchange and of adding to the
stocky of the exchange.
Ml" When we have accumulated all the
stock that we deem necessary then the
price of the goorls sold to the members of
the exchange will be reduced so ns to leave
only enough profit to return running ex
penses.
"We can thus never get into debt acd
the producer pets the hiphest possible re
turns for his wheat, beans, chickens, etc.,
as he is brought almost into direct con
tact with the consumer.
"On depositing produce with the ex
change a certificate for the wholesale
market price of the goods so deposited is
issued to the owner, and this certificate of
value (expressed in dollars and cents) is
receivable for anything in the stock of the
exchange.
"Accumulated wealth is represented by
these certificates of value, which are con
vertible into coin at the option of the ex
change, not the holder â just the con
trary rule, you will observe, that prevails
in the present financial policy of the
Government.
"Where an individual is desirous of ob
taining cash for his goods we sell it for
him in the open market, shipping to such
points as promise the best returns, and
charge him a small commission."s sion."
TIRED OF DEMOCRATS.
G. M. Button of Colusa Relates Kxperi-
ences That Caused Him to Be-
come a PopulUt.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 12.â G. M.
Bntton of Colusa, though a Populist for
but four years, is thoroughly wedded to the
cause, having been driven from the Demo
cratic ranks by the adoption of the Na
tional platform of that party at Chicago in
1892.
"At that time," said Mr. Sutton, refer
ring to the date of his political change of
heart, "I had $5000 over and above my cur
rent needs, part in cash ana part in prop
erty, outside of my eighty-acre ranch.
Since that time I have gradually gone be
hind, though I have no bad or expensive
habits, and I now do not spend two bits
unless I find it absolutely necessary.
"I am trying to educate my children as
a %vhite man oueht to and thought that by
th is time I would be able to move with my
family to a good school town. Instead we
all have to stick to the farm in order to
.hold our own. Myself, my wife and our
children all have to put our shoulders to
the wheel again."
Then in a restrospective strain and with
a view toward showing how disastrously
the Cleveland administration had affected
vis interests, he continued:
"I came across the plains to Colusa in
1859 with $7 75 in my pocket and made
steady increase in my affairs till the Cleve
land regime came in. Since ihen matters
have been getting worse for me and for all
my neigubors. Not only lias the value of
land depreciated, but the prices of all
products have fallen. No more Cleveland
ism for me, and I am congratulating my
self that I had the foresipht to see the
evils in that Democratic platform of 1892
and to withdraw from that party at that
time."
The first lively discussion took place and
the first Populist veil was heard during
the discussion which followed after recess
as to the Apportionment of delegates to
the National Convention.
The chairman provoked another yell
and a pattering of hands by his suggestion
that when a question was all one way it
was simply folly to waste time "in blow
ing off so much gas."
J. A. Johnson of San Francisco became
"immensely" popular when he announced
that the San Francisco delegation was in
favor of giving equal rfghts to the interior
counties. It was decided that the basis of
representation in the National Convention
should be five delegates from each Con

MRS. CATOR'S VIEWS.
Believes In Woman Suffrage, Economy
and thÂ« Free Coinage of
Silver.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 12.â Mrs. T.
V. Cator, the winsome wife of the gentle
man who is to be' the Populist Senatorial
candidate, is one of the two women dele
gates to the convention.
She arrived last evening in company
with the woman-suffrage delegation from
San Francisco and is the only woman dele
gate present, the other lady Populist, who
was eie cted from Los Angeles, being pre
vented from attending by illness. Mrs.
Cator thus clearly and concisely states her
position in politics:
"I have taken a great interest in study
ing economic questions, and I have
reached the conclusion that the Omaha
platform is a correct statement of prin
ciples. I did not desire to be a delegate to
the convention, but as I was elected I
have attended. I wished to resign, but so
many have asked me to accept that I
finally concluded to do so, and here I am.
I have done little work for woman suf
frage, but I think it is just.
"I consider free coinage of silver right,
and that it is very unjust to grant the
rights of free coinage to gold and deny it
to silver, because that depreciates prices
and makes money scarce, and thereby im
poverishes the debtor and turns all
property to the money-lending class, bat I
further believe that all money should be
issued by the Government, and be a full
legal tender for all debts."

THE NEWS FROM HAWAII
Mauna Loa in Active Eruption
and Belching Forth Floods
of Fire.
But a Greater Menace to Public Secu
rity Is the Volcanic Japanese
Element.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, May 6.â Several
of the excursionists to the Manua Loa
eruption returned here this morning,
having made a successful ascent to the
scene of action, spending the night of the
29th on the brink of the great caldron. No
outbreak has occurred on the outside of
the mountain. The immense output of
lava is expended toward filling the in
terior of the pit, four square miles in area.
It was estimated that half that space had
been covered 30 feet in depth. An open
fire-lake existed of 900 feet by 1400, as
measured by Dodge. In this lake many
fountains of lava were playing. The
largest fountain was 150 feet in diameter
and 250 feet hi'-h, in constant but some
what varying action, with terrific roar.
The statement sent May 1, that Kilanea
had resumed action, proves to have been
inaccurate. Only dense clouds of vapor
are seen in tbe pit.
Damon's refunding bill sustains repeat
ed defeats in the Senate. It is considered
certain that no such measure will pass
proposing the sale of 4 per cent bonds at
85 per cent. It is learned that Minister
Damon's three colleagues do not favor his
measure.
The bill for a new loan of $750,000 for
public improvemtnts is making d ogress.
Leading men express the confident
opinion that such bonds at 5 per cent will
sell readily at par in Honolulu. No bonds
have hitherto sold at less than 6 per cent,
but heavy sugar dividends are making
money plentiful.
Of late this Government has felt meas
urably relieved from its recent serious
apprehensions of interference from Japan
with a view of establishing authority over
Hawaii with the aid of her 25,000 tubjects
already located here.
Such views appear to have been not long
ago entertained by Japan, but Ita pres
ent severe complications with Russia and
embarrassments with Korea and Formosa
have latterly led that Government to con
fine its attention to affairs nearer home.
Much uneasiness is still felt on account of
this large Japanese population in Hawaii,
comprising a larger number of males than
any other nationality here, the native
Hawaiian* not excepted. Such an ele
ment might prove formidable, if well or
ganized, against the Government, consid
ering the well -proved political and
military ability of the Japanese. No pres
ent apprehensions, however, of any such
trouble appear to be called for.
A very great and important security
against such dangers will have been cre
ated whenever cable communication shall
have been established with the United
States enabling indications of trouble to
be promptly reported to our protecting
power.
In an interview this afternoon with W.
R. Castle, ex-Minister at \Vashington, Mr.
Castle said with emphasis: "I consider
the Japanese question altogether the most
menacing one before this Government.
This large Japanese population is restless',
uncertain in temper, and iiable at any
time to break out in impossible demands
and disorderly action. In case of any
such disturbance, our dealing with them
is liable to be displeasing to their Govern
ment and to lead to demands for redress.
Such demands are liable to result in per
emptory occupation of the islands by
Japan. We certainly need on this account
the earliest possible cable connection with
the United States."
A standing grievance with the Japanese
in Hawaii is that they are without the
voting franchise. This is liable to lead to
trouble, but to give them votes would be
extremely dangerous.

SANTA MONICA?
Senators Leave the Dispute
to a Board of Five
Examiners.
TERMS OF COMPROMISE.
Report of the Majority to the
Secretary of War to Be
Final.
PROVISIONS FOR CONTRACTS,
Not More Than $2,900,000 Shall Be
Expended, Whichever Location
Is Selected.
WASHINGTON. D. C, May 12.â The
California Senators distinguished them
selves to-day. White and Perkins made
vigorous speeches in opposition to the
Santa Monica appropriation. The result
of all this discussion is a "dog-fall."
Frye's compromise amendment, as re
ported in the press dispatches, is satis
factory to the California Senators, who
believe that the stubborn fight against the
power of millions of dollars has ended in
victory for the people. A board is to de
cide.
In the Senate this morning when the
river and harbor bill was taken up, Frye,
chairman of the Committee on Commerce,
continued his argument in support of the
committee amendment favoring Santa
Monica as the location of the deep-sea har
bor in Southern California.
White of California, a member of the
Committee on Commerce, argued against
the amendment. He asked where
the figure $3,098,000, fixed in the amend
ment for tbe improvement of Santa
Monica harbor, had been obtained. Frye
said that it had been obtained from Mr.
Hood, chief engineer of the Southern
Pacific, but that ail the details were on
tile in the office of the engineer corps in
Washington.
Frye begun to quote from Mr. Hunting
ton's testimony before the committee. He
spoke of him as the "individual ' referred
to by White, and as "the man of greed"
referred to by Berry (D.) of Arkansas.
"He is not," said Frye, "bulling the
stock martlets nor bearing them, nor 'cor
nering' wheat or flour, but he is engaged
in enormous enterprises, the results of
which have built up the commerce of this
republic, and in all his enterprises he is
successful. So if he be an 'individual' or
if he be 'greedy,' the reasons which induce
him to change from San Pedro to Santa
Monica are worthy of the consideration of
the name."
Frye quoted from the statements of Mr.
Huntington, ex-Senator Cole and Mr.
Corthell, civil engineer, as to the advan
tages which Santa Monica possesses over
San Pedro. Referring to the wishes of the
people of Los Angeles, he said they did
not enter into the case. The ship-owners
of Spain had far more interest in it than
the people of Los Angeles, who thought
one way one day on the subject and an
other way the next; who one year had a
plank in their Congressional convention
in favor of San Pedro and the next year
one in favor of Santa Monica.
Frye also quoted from the report of Col
onel Mendell of the coipsof engineers,
dated November 1, 1882, in which the bay
of Santa Monica is described, with the
statement tbat if the southwest waves
were cut off, as they could be by a break
water judiciously located, it would make
a harbor that might have any desired ca
pacity. At tbat time Los Angeles had a
population of 8000 or 10,000 (now 100,000)
and had no commerce, and consequently
Colonel Mendell did not recommend an
appropriation for it.
Frye also quoted from a like favorable
statement of Lieutenant Taylor of the
Pacific Coast Survey and read a letter to
himself from General Miles of May 9, 1894,
who bad had his headquarters for two
years at Los Angeles and who spoke of
Santa Monica as a place of National im
portance, which would undoubtedly be
the principal port of the entire Southern
Pacific Coast.
in conclusion Frye said: "We have had
this fight for years. We wish to be divest
ed of it, never to hear of it again, and I
hope for the reasons given the Senate will
vote down the amendment offered by the
Senator from California (White), will
agree to the amendment reported by the
committee, and that this contest shall' be
ended."
Perkins (R.) of California spoke in advo
cacy of the amendment offered by his col
league. He resented the representations
of Senators Vest and Frye against Mr.
Huntington, "the bogy man of Califor
nia," and said they were a vile slander
against the good name and fame of the
people of California. They had no preju
dices against Mr. Huntington and the
other leading officers of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad, and they had eiven proof of
that in the election of Mr. Stanford to the
Governorship of the State and twice to the
United States Senate, and in the choice at
the recent State Republican Convention
there of a vice-president of that com pan v
as a delegate-at-large to the Republican
National Convention, and who would be
elected a Presidential elector of the United
States.
As to the change of location of the
Southern Pacific Company, Perkins gave
this explanation of it: that the company
in landing 20,000 tons of coal a day for its
great railroad system had had to pay a
dollar a ton lighterage at Santa Monica
ana that by using its great wharf there it
saved that large outluy for lighterage, so
that the building of the wharf was a wise
business enterprise, not an experiment.
"The Senator from Maine said, referring
to some remarks which had been made by
my distinguished colleague (Mr. White):
'This savors of the slogan of the sand
lots of the Golden Gate where the nam e of
Huntington is conjured with to frighten
babies and is xmed by demagogues to make
weak-kneed politicians tremble.'
''Mr. President, I dislike exceedingly to
refer on this floor to any gentleman who
is not a member of this body, I dislike
exceedingly to refer to any one who is not
here to speak and answer for himself; but
I say that that charge is a libel upon the
fair name of the good people of
California, and I should be false
to those I represent if I permitted
tbe charge of the Senator to pass un
challenged. The people of California have
no prejudices against Mr. Huntington or
his assistants. I know nothing against
Huntington to his discredit, unless it be
his own testimony before a Congressional
committee and certain letters which it is
alleged he wrote to an assistant on the
board of directors of a company with
which he was connected. I have no feel
ing of personal animosity or jealousy or
envy toward him. I admire him for his
enterprise, for his pluck, for his energy. I
admire him for what he has accomplished
in his life.
" I knew him many years ago in Cali
fornia, when he was an honored and re
spected merchant in that State. He left
us to come East many years ago, and I do
not Know much of him except through
general reports since that time. But I re
pel the charge that tee people of California
seek office by disclaiming against him or
his assistance and by advocating that
which he desires or opposes. The people
of California, .in city and ooootry and
State, gave most liberally toward building
ti>e first transcontinental railroad. They
were in sympathy with the promoters, be
cause the latter wÂ«re with the people at
that time, and if to-day our people ccn T
sure them it is because tboy believe that
they have not been true to their trust, but
have forgotten the common interests and
common bond which unite their interests
witii the interests of California.
"If they are censured it is because they
use their great power sometimes to thwart
the wishes and desires of the people; but
that the name of Mr. Huntington is used
to influence acts of public men in Califor
nia is untrue. I repeat it is a vile slander
against the good name and fame of the
people of California.
"Only last week a great State Conven
tion met in California. There were in that
convention representatives from every
town and county in the State. They as
sembled at the capital, and among the star
resolutions they passed was one denounc
ing what is known as the railroad funding
bill. But to s!Â»ow that they had no preju
dice against individual members of that
company except only as to their action in
a corporate sense, they nominated lor Pres
idential elector the vice-president of that
railroad company, and as sure as the sun
risen and sets on election-day in November
next he will be elected a Presidential
elector of the United States."
White (D.) of California rose to follow
his colleague.
Frye said the bill must be voted on to
day if the Senate expected to have any
river and harbor bill this session.
Aldrich (R,) of Illinoisâ Why not vote
now ? .
"Not yet," White curtly remarked.
Vest said nobody had attacked the peo
ple of California. He had simply re
marked that Mr. Huntington seemed to
be the iÂ«sue and the great political factor
in that State. That was so much the case
that one gentleman who appeared before
the Committee on Commerce (an ex-Judge
of the Superior Court) had decided that
rather than make any compro
mise with Huntington or any con
cession to the Huntincton influence
he would expiate himself and cease to be
a citizen, and any man who would assert
that Huntington was not a burning issue
in that State had a hardihood which he
(Vest) did not envy and could not appre
ciate-
In that connection Frye read at extract
from a leading California newspaper,
abusing the members of the Committee
on Commerce who favored what it called
the Santa Monica "steal," and declaring
that their names had the suggestive sound
of a burglar-alarm.
"That is certainly," said Vest, "a vit
riolic utterance. The only surprise I ex
perience is that my name is not mentioned
in it. It is the first time I have escaped
when a charere of burglary or any other
crime has been made."
"They had not heard," said Frye, "that
you had made a speech declaring that Mr.
Huntington was entitled to the rights of a
civiliz d man. If they had heard it your
name would have been in the list.''
Vest soon drifted away in the San Pedro
and Santa Monica controversy into a dis
cussion as to the Eads jetty system at the
mouths of the Mississippi â this discussion
having for its foundation a newspaper in
terview (unfavorable to that system) with
Major Quinn of the engineering sorps.
White repudiated the insinuations of
Frye that there was anything of the "sand
lots" agitation on his (White's) side of the
controversy. The people of California, he
said, were just as law-abiding and as fully
competent to take care of their affairs as
were the constituents of the Senator from
Maine. He denied they were animated by
any sentiments that were not honorable
and manly. He (White) did not regard
the soil on which Mr. Huntington stood as
sacred, but he had uttered no unbecoming
word against him.
White spoke in playful ridicule of Frye's
pretensions to decide, after a survey of two
mornings, which was the better location for
the deep-sea harbor of California. The
fact was. he said, that Santa Monica was
an absolutely unprotected roadbed, with
hardly anything of the bay about it.
In the course of White's speech, he
referred to the eccentiicities of the late
Republican convention of California,
which l.ad resolutions condemning tne
Pacific Railroad funding bill, and had
then chosen as one of the delegates at large
a vice-president of the Southern Pacific,
and as a delegate the representative from
toe State, who, as a member of the Pacific
Railroad committee, had voted for the
funding bill.
The debate had gone on since Friday
last to the exclusion of almost every other
subject, and when it closed after four
hours' discussion to-day an amendment
was offered by the chairman of the Com
mittee on Commerce â Frye of Maine, an
advocate of Santa Monica â and was ac
cepted by Senators White of California,
Vest of Missouri, Pasco of Florida and
the other minority members of the com
mittee, and agreed to by the Senate with
out division.
As the matter now stands, the Senate
amendment provides for a board, consist
ing of an officer of the navy, to be de
tailed by the Secretary of tbe Navy; an
officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, to
be detailed by the superintendent of the
survey, and three civil engineers skilled in
riparian work, to be appointed by the
President of the United States, to examine
the two harbors, the report of the majority
to be final. And it is provided that when
ever the board shall have settled the loca
tion and made its report to the Secretary
of War, the Secretary of War shall make
contracts for the completion of the harbor
as selected by tbe board, according to the
project reported by it, at a cost not exceed
ing in the agcregate f_\9oo,ooo.
After that question was thus disposed
of, an amendment was offered by Gorman
of Maryland, limiting the annual expendi
ture under this and former river and
harbor bills to $10,000,000. A motion to
lav that amendment on the table, made
by Vest, was defeatedâ ayes 26, noes 31 â
and then the Senate at 6:30 o'clock ad
journed until to-morrow, witn the under
standing that a vote shall be taken on the
bill and amendments at 3 p. m. to-morrow.
The Independent Labor party of Eng
land raised Â£7000 for electioneering pur
poses last year, spending every penny
without gaining a single seat or retaining

CASES OF FILIBUSTERS.
Findings of the Court-Martial Are
Mailed to Spain for
Review.
CONFISCATE THE COMPETITOR
One More Patriot, Convicted of the
Crime of Rebellion, Shot
at Matanzas.
HAVANA. Cuba, May 12.â General
Weyler authorizes the statement that the
roceedings of the court-martial in the
case of Milton and others captured on the
filibuster Competitor were forwarded to
Madrid for the action of the Government,
by the mail steamer leaving Havana May
10. General Weyler also states that all
rumors that he or any of his generals have
threatened to resign if the sentence of the
court-martial in this case should be modi
fied are utterly untrue.
The findings of the conrt-martial before
which was tried the five men who were
captured on the filibustering American
schooner Competitor were published to
day for the first time. As already cabled,
all of tbe accused men were convicted and
sentenced to death. It has been ordered
that proceedings be instituted for the con
fiscation of the Competitor.
Florentine Herrera, convicted of the
crime of rebellion, was shot at Matanzas
this morning.
It is rumored that Maximo Gomez with
a strong force of rebels has re-entered the
province of Matanzas. His vanguard is
said to be near the town of Baro.
MADRID, Spain, May 12.â Spain and
the United States have arrived at an ami
cable understanding, and the Competitor
prisoners will be allowed a fresh trial be
fore the ordinary court under the existing
treaties between Spain and the United
States.
OLNEY WAS ADVISED
It Would been* That His Protest Was Hot
' ' yÂ«cenÂ»ary.
WASHINGTON, d. C, May 12.â 1t is
asserted that when the official correspond
ence relating to the Competitor incident is
made public it will be found that the
action of the Spanish Cabinet in directing
that the proceedings of the court-martial
be forwarded to Madrid for revision, which
was announced yesterday, actually took
place last Friday, and thatMinisterHannis
Taylor promptly communicated the fact
to Secretary Olney.
If this prove true it places the Govern
ment in a curious position, as the protest
sent to Spain must have been received, if
at all, after news had been received that
Spain had voluntarily interfered in behalf
of the condemned men.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 12.â Army
officers become singularly reticent and de
cline to express themselves the instant a
crisis arises between the administration
and any foreign power, but enough was
gathered yestesday to show that those of
the army stationed at New York are not
at all uneasy at the prospect of a war with
Spain. One prominent officer freely dis
cussed the situation on condition that his
name would not be mentioned. He said:
"If we should go to war with Spain the
United States would have possession of
Cuba in a very few days. In fact, in my
judgment, it would not require any longer
time than was necessary for the fleet to
reach Havana with the necessary forces on
board. The Spanish army on the island
would be between two fires at once, and
they are having about all they wish to do
now to keep the Cuban forces out of Ha
vana. As for the Spanish naval force now
in Cuban waters, you, as well as any other
man, can see with half an eye that it
would not count for two hour 3 against the
fleet of Admiral Bunce. now assembling in
New York harbor.
"No, I do not think the war would be
carried on by this country beyond the con
fines of Cuba. However, that might de
pend upon the amount of indemnity we
would think sne was entitled to in case the
provisions of tne protocol were violated.
"If that protocol were stained in any
particular it might cost Spain dearly.
The only source of danger is that Spain
might take into her mind to bombard some
of our minor ports. With tbe forces at
command for offensive operations, every
body is quite as familiar as any army man.
In fact the number of volunteers would
only be limited by the call issued by the
President. We never have depended upon
a standing army, and we would not need
any in the case of Spain. Now, if it were
England, the case would be vastly dif
ferent."
A Herald special from Richmond, Va.,
says: General Fitzhugh will go to Wash
ington on Wednesday to receive his in
structions before departing for Cuba. He
will leave for Tampa, Fla., Friday or
NEW TO-DAY.

Saturday, the date to be determined at
Washington. He expects to be iv Cuba
the first of next week.
The Recorder says this morning: An
other steamer is being titted out in this
country by Cuban patriots to follow the
Laurada, which left this port early Sunday
morning with a filibustering expedition
for Cuba. She will start in the next five
days. The Laurada was the first Cuban
filibuster whose men took uniforms with
them. Detectives have found out the tailor
who made the uniforms, a Spaniard. He
is making seventy-five more, which are to
be ready in the next four days. The fifty
one suits that the tailor made for the Lau
rada men were for Porto Ricans, with three
exceptions, one American and two Cu
bans. All the suits he is making now are
for Porto Ricans.
The steamer which is to take them to
Cuba is now somewhere off the Connecti
cut shore, taking aboard arms and ammu
nition. She will take ten Hotchkiss guns,
which were intended to go on the Laurada,
and which are destined for General Col
lazo's artillery division, and a large num
ber of rifles and ammunition.
Some of the Porto Ricans who will go
with the expedition are compositors em
ployed by a South American newspaper
near Park Row. Only last Sunday they
met in a photographic studio in Third
avenue, where their pictures in groups
were taken. Their plans were to go as
in the Laurada's case, in groups of four
or five, to a Brooklyn pier, take tugs there
waiting them and be transferred to the
stream in the sound, but aa tbe place of
rendezvous in Thrrd avenue has been ex
posed they were instructed to meet some
where in Harlem, but they will receive no
information as to the locality until the
last moment.
Besides this expedition, which will start
in five days, the Cubans will send out the
Magnetic which has been hired for $16,000
for two trips, and continue the prepara
tions for the fleet. The South Portland
and five other freight steamers will be
fitted out at Perth Amboy. N. J., and a
number of euns have been ordered from a
Broadway firm. This firm represents
Connecticut manufacturers, whose fac
tories are kept busy day and night filling
the orders for the Cubans. Large orders
for machetes have also been placed with a
large Water-street concern.
IN THE HOUSE.
Contested Election Case Conaumea Meat
of the Day.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 12.â An
hour and a half was occupied after tbe
opening of to-day's session in disposing of
a motion made by Perkins (R.) of Con
necticut, chairman of the Committee on
Printing, to exclude from the permanent
record certain matters inserted by Wheeler
(D.) of Arizona, for which, it was asserted
by Perkins, he had received no permission.
Wheeler contended that he had a right to
insert the matter complained of, bu* the
House held otherwise, and by a vote of
144 to 75 the matter was ordered to be ex
cluded.
The remainder of the day was spent in
discussing the contested election cases of
Rinaker vs. Downing, from the Sixteenth
District of Illinois. The majority of the
Elections Committee No. 2 recommended
the unseating of Downing (D.).
The principal speech of the day was that
of Moody (R.) of Massachusetts, who
joined the minority in sustaining Down
ing's right to the seat â at least, until a re
count of all the votes, ordered by the
House, shall demonstrate that he is not
entitled to it.
The discussion will be resumed to-mor
row, the special order making private pen
sion bills the business of that session hav
ing been postponed until Thursday.
The House adjourned at 5:15 p. m.

Lady Members of the Natatorial

Privileges.
HOT A SERIOUS DISAGREEMENT
One of the Most Delightful Attractions
of Hanford the Center of
Discussion.
HANFORD, Cal., May 12.â Hanford is
agitated; not turbulently, but interest
edly agitated. Fair woman has caused
the pleasant ripple in Hanford's erstwhile
placid social life. Her right to swim in
the Hanford Natatorial Society's line new
swimming baths is the question of the
hour in this city. No one is losing any
sleep over the matter, no hatreds are en
gendered in the discussion, yet there is
keen interest shown in the question.
Shall there be a ladies' annex to the Nata
torial Society ? Shall there be a day, or
two of them, set apart for the exclusive
entertainment at the baths of tbe sex that
may not yet vote?
Shall there be certain hours each day
devoted to the lady batners? Shall women
be denied the baths entirely? These are
questions of the hour at Hanford, and
they elicit greater public interest in their
discussion than one who is not a dweller
near the shores of Lake Tulare would read
ily believe. Hanford is proud of her
public schools, of her handsome public
and business buildings, of her remarkable
deciduous fruit crop (even in this remark
able year of late frosts), of her citrus fruit
belt, of her thrift and enterprise, of her
climate, her social opportunities and her
commercial progress and successes â last,
but by no means least â of her recently
acquired swimming baths.
This is one of the proudest and most
delightful institutions of Hanford. It cost
a pile of money to build the big tank and
properly roof and wall it; and then the
lockers, equipments and the pure artesian
well water that flows perpetually through
it cost another modest pile of dollars.
Messrs. Robinson & Rollins furnished
most or all of the coin, and then, when all
was in running order, they wisely decided
to still further popularize their enterprise
by turning its management over to the
hands of a club or society that should be
composed of some of the best known and
most popular young people in Hanford.
Thus the Hanford Natatorial Society came
into being. This society leased the swim
ming baths by the year from Robinson <fc
Rollins, and about three weeks ago for
mally opened the baths by some speech
making, much music and enough refresh
ments to more than go around.
Now, at this time the sex problem never
presented itself to either the builders of
the baths or the lessees thereof.so that when
the full list of membership in the Hanford j
Natatorial Society was first made public
the names of not a few ladies were found
on the roll. This fact and the seeming ne
cessity of setting apart a certain day of
the week or certain hours of each day
when the ladies could have the baths to
themselves aroused all this discussion
that is now going on so keenly.
Many arguo that men and women should
be permitted to join the society on terms
of perfect equality. Others desire to es
tablish a ladies' annex to the club. Others
still â but these are not as strong in num
bers as in words â desire to have women
banished entirely from club membership,
and would even go bo far as to prohibit
them from the use of the baths at all
times. At the present time the full mem
bership of the society is as follows :

So much for the male members of tbe
society, their names being given first be
cause tbe list is longer and more imposing
to those who judge from numerical
strength alone. The lady members, how
ever, though by no means so strong in
numbers, are a determined and compact
little body, that has all the more strength
in the society from the fact that every
member of it is held in the highest esteem
by the larger body of members. Their
names are as follows:
Mrs. J. D. Fish
Mrs. A. Yell
Clara Bryant Heywood
M rs. F. Foster
Mrs. J. L. ChaJdock
Miss Kmily L. Docbee
Mrs. W. V. Buckner

Miss Belle Jacobs

Miss Nettie L. Helton
From one of the club members, who
makes no pretentions of knowing it all,
and yet who has a good deal of influence
in the councils of the society and a
thorough knowledge of all its members, it
is learned that the most probable outcome
of the whole matter will be that men and
women shall hereafter be admitted on
equal footing. Tbe dues of both sexes
will be tbe same, their responsibilities and
voting privileges tbe same.
At first the plan will be tried of setting
apart certain hours of the day in which
the ladies shall have exclusive use of the
baths. If this plan does not prove suc
cessful it is quite likely that all restrictions
as to sex will be removed and the baths
thrown open to all members at tbe usual
bathing hours. There is nothing im
modest in a proper bathing suit, it is
argued, and certainly nothing very at
tractive. The human form divine or de
formed never appears at its best in a loose
fitting, coarse woolen robe, and, least of
all, is it sex-attracting when dripping wet
or disporting in cold water. Tins is con
sidered to bo the common-sense view of
the matter, and this will probably be tbe
final outcome of the whole question.
A day each week, or possibly two of
them, will be set apart fonhe accommoda
tion of the general public at a nominal fee
for suits and towels. It is this latter de
termination of the society that has served
srreatjy to popularize the baths and make
all of Hanford interested in its discussions
and its welfare. Naturally, the entire
population cannot become members of the
society, but so long as the entire popula
tion can have the privileges of the baihs on
certain days, if not all the time, the wnole
community feels a sense of piideful pro
prietorship, and it is not the slightest ex
aggeration to say that Hanford is tremen
dously proud of the new swimming baths.
The tank covers an area, inside measure
ment, of 50x100, and has a depth of the
very clearest and most transparent clear
water, that varies from four feet to ten
feet. Of course, there are chutes and
springboards, and all those playful and
healthful appendages. That the new baths
will increase in popularity as the weather
grows more settled goes without saying.
SACRAMENTO SENSATION.
Ex-Mayor Gregory Arrested on a Charge
of Having Defrauded Mrs.
Bruce B. Lee.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. May 12.â Eugene
J. Gregory, ex-Mayor of this city, was ar
rested to-day on three complaints pre
ferred by Mrs. Bruce B. Lee, who accuses
him of obtaining personal property by
false and fraudulent pretenses.
The complaints charge that in January,
1893, he secured $6000; in May, 1894, $2000.
and in August, 1894, $1000. They are sim
ilarly worded, alleging that Gregory repre
sented that the copartnership and firm of
Gregory Bros. Co., then doing business in
Sacramento, was in good financial condi
tion and solvent; and Mary A. Lee, believ
ing his statements, was induced to deliver
to Gregory $6000. $2000 and $1000, in three
deposits. As a matter of fact, the plaint
itt declares, the Gregory Bros. Co. was
not in good financial condition, and was
not solvent.
It seems that the money was loaned to
Gregory Bros. Co. at various times before
their failure, and that Mrs. Lee appeared
in the insolvency proceedings as one of
the firm's heaviest creditors. The firm's
failure was almost total, and Mis. Lee
lost with the other creditors.
THE FORESTERS AT UKIAH
Insubordination Charges Against
Treasurer Henderson Are
Withdrawn.
DalegaUs Tendered a Reception at
the Opera-House by Citizens

UKIAH, Cal., May 12.â The seventh
annual session of the High Court, Ancient
Order of Foresters, opened this morning
in Christian Church, William Cashman,
high chief ranger, presiding. One hun
dred and nineteen courts are represented
at the convention.
A telegram from S. McMullen, past high
chief ranger, stating his inability to be
present at the meeting and expressing his
regrets, was read.
Suspension of the regular order of busi
ness was ordered, and the matter of the
suspension of High Court Treasurer John
Henderson by the executive council for
insubordination was taken up. After con
siderable debate a motion to sustain the
action of the executive council was
adopted. It was then moved that Hender
son be reinstated treasurer of the High
Court, which motion prevailed. At the
evening session the charges against Hen
derson were withdiawn.
High Chief Ranger Cashman ap
pointed the followine committees for the
ensuing term:
Committee on relief and state of orderâ
T, B. McCarthy, S.J. Campbell and Charles F.
FTye.

Shaw. Frank Hogan and Dr. A. B. McGlll.
Mileage and per diemâ Charles D. McClellan,
Dr. R. P. Chandler and M. O'Gara.

W. H. Eastman.
Next place of meetingâ Davis, E. 8.
Johnson and G. 6. Graham.
Distributionâ W.G.Thompson, F. L. Arlow
gast and Niels Anderson.
From the address of High Chief Ranger
Gasbman it appears that during the past
year twenty-two new courts were insti
tuted, and during the same period fifteen
courts were suspended for various reasons.
The delegates were tendered a reception
at the Opera-house this evening. An ad
dress of welcome was delivered by Mayor
T. L. Carothers. and the keys to the city
delivered by him to the visitors.
TRAGEDY HEAR GRIDLEY
Miss Sarah Haugh Ends Her
Life by Swallowing Fly
Poison.
Fights Against the Attempt of a
Physician to Give Her
Relief.
GRIDLEY, Cal., May 12.â Miss Sarah
Haugh, aged about 35 years, the eldest
daughter of John Haugh, a wealthy Sutler
County farmer, took her own life by poison
to-day under sad and mysterious circum
stances. No reason for the act is known
and the community is mystified.
The Hau;:h farm is Eituated four miles
from Gridley. At noon to-day the family
of five were at home. A cup of liquid
cobalt had been prepared for poisoning
flies. Without giving warning of her in
tention Miss Haugh took the cup, walked
a few feet from the porch, where her
brother was seated, and deliberately drank
the liquid. Then turning the cup toward
her brother, who thought she had taken
a drintt of water, she said :
"See, Matt, 1 have taken poison."
A physician was at once summoned from
Gridley and arrived an hour later. He
asked why she had taken the poison and
she replied that she did not know. Even
in her agony Miss Haugh fought against
attempted relief, and bit the tube of a
stomach-pump in two. Ah efforts on the
part of the physician was fruitless and the
unfortunate woman died at 5 o'clock.

WOES OF THE BALLERINOS
Divorce Proceedings After Xearly fifty
%ears of Married Life.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 12.â A novel
and pathetic spectacle was presented in
the Superior Court here this morning,
when aged Mr. and Mrs. Ballerino en
tered the courtroom with their string of
attorneys, witnesses and friends, in oppo
sition to each other, after having been
wedded nearly fifty years. The proceed
ings were behind closed doors. The wife
is plaintiff, and she charges her aged
spouse with infidelity and asks the court
for a large share of his possessions.
The co-respondent is known as Irma, a
woman of the tenderloin district, where
most of Ballerino's possessions are locat
ed. The woman was Ballerino's tenant,
and Mrs. Ballerino claims that the old
man's regard for Irma became so strong
that be forgot bis vows to the mother of
his numerous children. lira a denies the
story of Ballerino's duplicity. Her story
is that the old man of wealth never col
lected his rents personally, except during
one period of fifteen days," and at no other
time did he set foot in her abode.
When the case was called Mrs. Ballerino,
through her lawyers, announced that she
was ready. The old man also expressed his
readiness. The plaintiff called him to the
stand as her own witness, to prove the ex
tent of their belongings. Ballerino was
made to undergo a searching examination
respecting his property, which is com
munity, and estimated to be worth $250,
-000. Ballerino was asked bow much
money be had given his wife within the
last ten years. He had no idea. Sometimes
he gave her $1, $2 or $10. but he had never
kept any account of it. The next line of
inquiry was directed as to his expendi
tures for his children, when the case went
over until to-morrow.
HIS CATCH A. CORPSE.
The Body of a Suicide Recovered by a
Fisherman.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., May 12.â An old
fisherman made a ghastly haul with i a
throwline at West Lake this afternoon, i
He recovered from the water the corpse of
Mr?. May Emerson, wife of Fred Emerson,
who a short time ago conducted the Balti
more restaurant at Seventh and Olive
streets.
The Emersons came from San Francisco.
The unfortunate woman's mother, Mrs.
Mary Merriam, and a sister, Mrs. Bertha
Flagg of 1010 Dcvisadero street, live
in that city. There is no doubt that
Mrs. Emerson committed suicide. It is
known that husband and wife had re
cently quarreled because of Emerson's at
tention to Maggie Love, a waitress. The
wife's protests brought forth many fair
promises, which were soon violated, and
in a lit of desperation she ieft her apart
ments last Saturday evening, going in the
direction of the lake. That was the last
seen or i card of her until her body was
recovered to-day.
The husband has been employed lately
at the Royal bakery on Spring street, but
it seems that he was apprehensive of some
calamity, for he left last evening lor Ban
Francisco. Mrs. Emerson was a comely
woman, about 26 years of age, of the bru
nette type and well dressed. A short time
ago she worked as a servant in a Hill
street residence, where she manifested
good bringing up and a fair education.
RANCHER BARKER'S TRIAL.
Arraigned for the Killing of HilUam
Hmdell in Pasadena.
LOS ANGELEB, Cal., May 12.â John A.
Barker, the Pasadena rancher who shot i
and killed William Hendell on March 5,
is on trial here to-day.
Hendell had been "confined in jail. He
escaped, went to Pasadena and visited the
Barker residence. His attention to Mrs.
Barker had before excited the jealousy of
Barker, who had hunted Hendell with a
shotgun. Not appreciating this warning,
Hendell sought the Barker residence as j
soon as he got away from jail. Barker,
however, was at hand, and the result was
the death of Hendell.
The morning was consumed in getting a
jury and in examining- the officer who
found the body in a canyon back of the
house near Pasadena. The deceased had
been shot in the left side, the load coming
out at the small of his back.
SHASTA'S MI NING ROOM.
Large Smelter to Be Erected in the Igo
District.
REDDING, Cal, May 12.â The mining
industry of Shasta County received another
boom yesterday. The miners of Igo
district, one of the richest sections of min
eral country in California, met and con
sidered a proposition advanced by the #
Clear Creek Mining and Development
Company to erect a large smelter to work
the ores of that district. The sentiment
of the meeting was decidedly in favor of
tne project, and as a result Shasta County
will soon have another largo smelting
plant in full operations. The capacity of
the new plant will be 200 tons daily. It is
expected that operations will be com
menced in about ninety days. The miners
of Western Shasta are jubilant over the
prospects for the future development of
the mineral resources of that portion of
the county.
Booth- Tuckers Leave Seattle.
SEATTLE, Wash., May 12.âAccom
panied by their party and Major Gifford of
the local army. Commander and Consul
Booth-Tucker left to-day for Taconia,
from which city they will depart to-mor
row for the central States, arriving at
Topeka, Kan., on Sunday. Just before
his departure the commander said it
might be found advisable to move the
Salvation Army headquarters of the
United States from New *T Drk City further
West. He would neither indicate when
nor admit that such a course had been
definitely decided upon.
MADERA'S BOY BANDITS
Two Youths Steal Horses and
Start Out to Become
Road Agents.
Ride Up to a Church Door and At
tempt to Shoot One of the
Worshipers.
MADERA, Cal., Mar 12.â Albert Soaper
and Will Hamilton, boys aged respectively
15 and 18 years, are striving to emulate
the example of Laverone and Roberts,
and are meeting with a marked degree of
success. Each of them in his father's ab
sence from home on Sunday procured the
best saddle horse and outfit their respec
tive parents possessed and went down to
the church at Webster. While the pastor
was conducting the service? one of the
boys rode up and called to a young man
named Pitman, asking him to come out
side. He started to come out, but before
he reached the door he saw one of the boys
waiting, revolver in hand, to shoot him
ami discreetly remained inside.
When the intention of the boy 3 was
learned there was confusion and tumult
inside the church. The boys then rode
away and have not been home since. They
both have pistols and are well mounted.
Constable Glass started after the boys
yesterday. He traced them up the San
Joaquin River to Lane's Bridge, which
they crossed and came down again toward
Herndon, where they ate dinner yesterday.
The constable was unable to overtake
them. They have been breaking down
fences and riding through grain fields, but
that is the extent of the damage they have
done. They are still in the vicinity of
Herndon.

ATTACKED BY HIGHRINDERS
Two Mongols Invade a Merchants' Cellar
and Collect Tolls.
MADERA, Cal., May 12.â A disturbance
in the Chinese quarters aroused people
residing in that vicinity at 1 o'clock this
morning. Two highbinders who arrived
in town a few days ago entered the cellar
of a local merchant, pounced upon him
and robbed him of $80. The victim cried
lustily for help and another Chinaman
came to the rescue. One of the robbers set
upon the rescuer and stabbed him in the
neck several times. The wounded Mongol
is in a serious condition.
The whole of Chinatown was aroused by
tbe disturbance anu a great hubbub
resulted. Constable Saxe- was the only
white man in the crowd and he had to
awaken several citizens to assist him in
arresting the highbinders who seemingly
had a large number of friends in the crowd.
The robbers were finally captured and were
taken to Fresno this evening by Under-
Sheriff Merritt, as the Madera Jail needs
repairing just at present.
LOOT A MADERA RANCH.
Outlaws Later one and Roberts Procure a
Supply of Prorisiofis.
MADERA, Cal., May 12.â Outlaws La
rerone and Roberts are still at large and
nothing definite as to their whereabouts
has been ascertained. C. Saxe returned
from the vicinity of Coarse Gold Gulch to
day and reports that a sheep camp be
longing to Jonathan Daulton was looted
yesterday morning near that place, all of
the provisions being taken. Messengers
were sent immediately to the officers and
the bloodhounds have* been taken to tbe
vicinity, in the hopes that it may yet be
possible to t*-ail the outlaws. If this effort
with the hounds fails the officera will cease
active hunting and await the appearance
of the bandits to secure provisions.
OAKESDALE JUSTICE.
Mrs. Griffin l'unishrs Her Husband for
a Brutal Crime.
SPOKANE, Wash., May 12.â Thomas
Griffin, a prominent farmer residing near
Oakesdale, made a vicious attack upon
Bessie, the 14-year-old daughter of J. W.
Gunn, a merchant of that place. Gunn,
armed with a ritie, went to Griffin's house
to kill him. Mrs. Grifiin met him at the
door, and upon learning of her husband's
crime, locked the doors and, procurinc a
club, beat Griffin nearly to death. Griffin
was placed under arrest and a strong guard
put over him, as Gunn says he will kill the
wrÂ«tch.
7'rtntumn't Chronic Insolvent.
PETALUMA, Cal., May 12.â The stock
of the insolvent jeweler, O. M. Campbell,

RIGGS` CIRCUIT
ENDS AT FRESNO
The Members of the Rose
Stillman Company
Stranded.
ALL DATES CANCELED.
Penniless Thespians Claim They
Have Not Been Paid by
the Manager.
WITHOUT MEANS TO MOVE ON.
Their Employer Accused of Treating
Them ShahbilyâHe Says
All Is Well.
FRESNO, Cal., May 12.â Rose Still
man's company, which played at Barton
Opera-house every i:ight last week, is in
trouble in this city. It is generally under
stood that the comt any is stranded, al
though Manager Ct arles Riggs says nay.
The troupe had boarded a hotel bus yes
terday morning to go to a tram for Mer
ced, where they werv booked to show last
night. Just as the bus was about to start
Manager Riggs came out of the hotel and
stated that they would not go to Merced
for the present. He told tho actors and
actresses to meet him at tho theater in a
half hour.
At the theater Riggs announced that the
Rose Stillman company was disbanded.
He bad failed to me .t expenses in Fresno
and had come here without any money.
Riggs now says ihat he disbanded the
company for the purpose of discharging
three of the members who have been in
attentive to business. They are Messrs.
Snow, Felt and Sutherland. He says that
he has reorganized the company and is
awaiting the arrival of men from San
Francisco to fill thei- places.
From the memberf of the company it is
learned that nearly all of them are
stranded, as they have not been re
engaged. They are without means, and
had it not been for friends here they would
have been in a serious predicament. They
say Riggs has treated them shamefully
and has not paid them anything for
several weeks. The company was or
ganized by Riggs in Los Angeles, and is
not of first-class character. Riggs for
merly resided in Fresno and ran an opera
house here.
Friends have arranged to give a benefit
at Barton Opera-house for the stranded
members of the company in a few days.
THE WEAVERVILLE TRIAL
The Taking of Testimony in Defense of
Van Horn and Crow
Begins.
WEAVERVILLE, Cal., May 14â The
last witness for the prosecution in the
trial of Constable Van Horn and his
deputy, John Crow, went upon the stand
to-day, and the taking of testimony for the
defense began. "Yes" Palmer and Gordon
Van Horn, a brother of one of the officers
accused of the lynching of "Jack" Little
neld in Round Valley, testified to minor
details during the morning.
The opening statement for the defense
was made by Attorney Given. At its close
the first witness for the defense, H. C.
Simmons, was called, rie had not con
cluded his testimony when the court ad
journed. His testimony is considered
very important by the defense. He de
scribed the character of the ground at the
scene of the Littlefield lynching. He bad
found a 44-cahber shell at the .manzanita
bush which has become historic in this
case. As the defendants claim to have
carried no weapons of this caliber this is
considered a strong point in their behalf.
Juror James Benton died this evening.
He had been excused from duty on the sth
inst. and another juror was obtained in
his stead.
Equal Suffragists at San i~uis.
SAN" LUIS OBISPO, Cal., May 12.-
Miss Mills delivered a long and able dis
course on woman's suffrage here this after
noon. Miss Shaw spoke this evening.
Her answers to questions were witty and
to the point. The woman's suffrage
campaign is fairly launched in this city,
and Rev- Anna H. Shaw and Misses
Mills and Yates have done a great deal
toward putting the movement in a right
light before the people of San Luis Obispo.
WAS REGULARLY ADOPTED
The Republican Convention Voted
on the Credential Com
mittee's Report.
Chairman Arthur Answers the Cairn
That the Findings Were Not
Accepted.
PASADENA, Cal., May 12.â W. E.
Arthur, in an interview to-day, said :
"In regard to a statement said to appear
in a San Francisco paper of this date, to
the effect that the report of tbe committee
on credentials at the recent Republican
State Convention was never adopted, I
have to state most positively that the re
port of the committee was adopted by a
vote of the convention.
â¢'When the report was presented, Mr.
Taylor of Alameda moved that tbe items
of the report be taken up seriatim. A
vote was had upon this motion and the
chair declared it lost. Mr. Taylor de
manded the roll-call. Tbe point of order
was raised that the roll-call was not de
manded in time; but the chair ruled that
the point of order was not well taken, and
ordered the roll-call, which resulted in a
very decided defeat of the motion.
"A motion was then made that the report
of the committee be adopted and, if I am
not mistaken, it was made by Colonel
Freeman G. Teed of Los Angeles. The
motion was duly seconded, and stated to
the convention by the chair. During the
discussion which followed some delegate
moved the previous question, and I sup
pose that whatever misunderstanding
there may have been about the action of
the convention arose from this. But the
motion was never seconded and was never
entertained by the chair, and a vote on
the demand for the previous question was
never taken. But as the presidinc officer
of the convention I did state to the con
vention that the question was upon the
adoption of the report, and called for the
vote, which resulted in a most decided
majority in favor of the adoption of the
report,|and I declared the motion carried
and the report adopted.
"Afterward Mr .Farnum of the contest
ing Alameda delegation moved that the
deletes who had been declared uuseated
should be excluded from the convention,
or something to that effect, and I ruled
bis motion out of order on the express
ground that, the report of the committee
on credentials having been adopted, the
delegates who were thereby declared un
seated no longer had any rights in the
convention, and that it would be unneces
sary to further invite them to retire. I
think that at that time Mr. Reuf, who had
a proxy in the Alameda delegation, stated
that the report had not been adopted, but
I replied that it had been adopted. If
there had been any doubt as to the adop
tion of the report it seems to me that was
the time to have had the question settled.
As a matter of fact, the call for the pre
vious question was never entertained by
the chair nor voted upon by the conven
tion, and the question before the conven
tion when the vote was taken was upon
the adoption of the report of 4he commit
tee on credentials."
Other Pasadena delegates âM. H.
Weight, John S. Cox, C. M. Simpson and
James Clarke â reported the same remem
brance and understanding of the matter
when seen by a Call correspondent to
day.

the whole exposition will prove as success
ful as of yore;
STILL AT SANTA BARBARA
The Battle-Ship Oregon's Trial
Trip Delayed by a Heavy
Swell
To-Day the Floating Fortress Will
Race Against Time for a
Record.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., May 12.â The
battle-ship Oregon did not go out on its
official trial trip to-day. The wind died
out and the morning was a beautifiul one,
but yesterday's storm had left a very heavy
swell along the coast, and after a consulta
tion it was dedided to postpone the trial
until to-morrow.
Everything was in readiness this morn
ing at 5 o'clock for the attempt. The boil
ers and furnaces had been cleaned yester
day and during the night steam was got
up. The Unadilla was sent out to its sta
tion at the starting point and all was in
readiness. It was then that Irving M.
Scott and Captain C. Miner Goodall held
their consultation. The latter pointed out
that the heavy swell would knock at least
a quarter of a Knot off the Oregon's speed
and Mr. Scott agreed with him. Admiral
Beardslev was then consulted, and the re
sult was that the Unadilla was recalled
and the race against time postponed.
There has hardly been a breath of
wind all day, and should a gale not
spring up during the night the battle-ship
will go at 5 a. m. to-morrow.
During the afternoon Admiral Beards
ley and Irving M. Scott gave an informal
reception to the members of the Country
Don't Give Up.
THERE IS A CURE FOR ALL MEN WHO ARE SICK AND
* weak. Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt, with its recent improve-
ments, its wonderful life-giving electric power, controlled by an
improved self-regulator, is a positive cure for all men who, by
early indiscretions or excesses, have wasted their manly vigor.
It is a positive cure for all forms of nervous or vital weakness,
varicocele (swollen veins), weak back, kidney troubles, sciatica,
rheumatism, lumbago, indigestion, dyspepsia and stomach trou-
bles of all kinds. It is, in fact, a cure for every ailment arising
from weakness of the various organs of the body. Thousands
testify to this. Here are some of the late cures who gladly
testify to the wonderful power of
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.
John Curran, 1419 Folsom street, San Francisco; H. Bauoh. 1109 Treat avenue, San Fran-
Cisco: Captain Henry Beck, 240 Montgomery street, San Francisco; Arthur Yuagens. C Troop,
Presidio, San Francisco: Richard Reiner, cook steamer Barbara Hernster, Ban Francisco;
Thomas Ray, American Exchange Hotel, san Francisco; Gottlieb Bachman, 523 Pine street,
San Francisco; William Dawaon, 1422 Sutter street, San Francisco; William H. Jukes, 1782
Atlantic street, Oakland; F. B. Galloway, Densmore, Cal. ; L. L. Jaccard, San Leandro. Cal.;
E. L. Nash, Picard, Siskiyou County, Cal.; L. C. Minyard, Napa, Cal. ; David â¢M. Frame,
Veterans' Home, Cal.; Theo. Seawall, 12Otterson street, San Jose; E. B. Hore, Alameda, Cal. :
Hundreds of others could be given. These cures have all
been reported within the past month. They mean a great deal
to the poor unfortunate who has been spending his daily earn,
ings on quacks and drugs. They mean that after all else hag
failed Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt will cure. J

BUYS A MONTECITO HOME.
CC V ru* ATcCortnick Jr. of Chicago Take*
Possession of Riven Jtoek.
SANTA BARBARA. Cal., May 12.-
Cyrus McCormick Jr. of Chicago, son and
namesake of McCormick of reaper farm
and wealth, has bought the beautiful
home of 0. A. Stafford at Momecitc
called Riven Rock. This is one of thÂ«
choicest resident spots in that charm ins
valley, lying on an easy slope of the foot
hills at an elevation of some 500 feet, and
commanding a superb view of the sea and
the distant mountainous islands. ThÂ«
place comprises some twenty acres ol
lightly rolling land, with a considerable
orchard of lemons and oranges in full
bearing. Around the large, old-fashioned,
frame house are stately oakes and syca
mores, and close by is a deep ravini
arched with trees and carpeted with vinci
trailing over its stony bed.
A good water right goes with the land,
and it offers every facility for the niosi
elaborate cultivation and development.
It is situated but a short distance from
the handsome residences of R. Radchffe
Wbitehead, Charles E. Eaton, General
Henry Strong, Henry Stoddard, E. H,
lawyer, the Hayne homestead and of I. A.
Waterman, the young Philadelphia mil
lionaire. It is understood that Mr. Mo-
Cormick paid $25,000 for the place and will
make costly and extensive improvements.
The poetical name attached to the pic
turesque estate was suggested by a great
bowlder near the entrance, which has
been literally riven in twain by a sturdy
oat, which spreads its cool shade above it.
Mr. McCormick and his wife spent some
weeks in Montecitq this winter, his young
invalid sister navine her residence bui
half a mile distant, in a cottage facing thÂ«
sea.

STOCKTON, CAL.,'May 12.â The Prohi
bition State Convention will be held in
this city to-morrow afternoon and the
delegates began to assemble in Stockton
this evening. A number came in on the
afternoon trains from various point: and
more reached here by the evening train
from the south and from t tie bay cities.
The greater portion of the delegation will
not arrive uutil shortly before noon to
morrow.
The local Prohibitionists have been
making great preparations for the event
and have secured Masonic Music Hall in
which to hold the convention. This is the
hall in which the famous Stockton conven
tion of the Democratic party was held
years ago, but the Prohibitionists feel that
their work will be harmonious, no matter
where they meet. The hall has been
tastefully decorated.
If tne delegates arrive in time there will
be a meeting of tbe State Central Com
mittee of the party in the hall at 10
o'clock and the convention will be called
to order at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. In
the evening an address will be delivered
by Rev. John A. B. Wilson of Los Angeles
and the local members of the party have
been advertising the fact far and wide, as
they expect to hear a great speech on the
principles of the organization. On Thurs
day evening John G. Wooliey, the famous
Prohibition orator, will deliver an address
and there will probably be no vacant seats
in thtfbig hall.
Secretary C. A. Tupper of San Jose is ex
pected to arrive during the night, and so
are a number of those high in tbe counsels
of the party in this State. Barron of
Soulsbyville, in the mountains, one of the
most active workers in the State, is here
now. He never fails to attend a Pro
hibition convention. His work has been
among the miners of the mountain region
from which he comes, and he has been
campaigning for fourteen years. Several
years ago John P. St. John delivered an
address there, driving over the mountains
from bonora, and found the mining camp
one of the best Prohibition towns on the
coast, ail through the work of Mr. Barron.
The only differences that are liable to
arise in the convention are on the adop
tion of a "narrow-gauge platform," as the
Stockton delegate puts it. The local Pro
hibitionists are heartily in favor of having
the platform say some very strong things
about woman suffrage aud free silver, but
they are not sure that they can carry their
point, as there are many who oppce com
ing out for anything else than prohibition
pure and simple. The Stockton delega
tion includes Attorney L. W. Elliott, R.
F. Wilson, chairman of the recent county
convention; Leroy Atwood, the printer,
and Mrs. W. M. Estes.
The other delegates from this county
are B. P. Baird of Lodi, W. H. Priest of
Lathrop, Joseph Potter of Linden and
Joseph Manchester of Farmington. None
of the men from this county are aspirants
for the position as delegates to the
National convention. They are willing to
let some other good Prohibitionists have
this honor.
In view of the fact that there are not
enough of the delegates here from whom
to gather a conclusion, it is difficult to say
whether the platform to be adopted will be
a "broad gauge" one or not. As there are
no spoils to be worked for by the party
there is little of the wire pulling that is
seen at otber conventions. The local men
are inclined to break away from such
leaders as Samuel Dickie, chairman of the
National committee, and Joshua Levering.
They admire John P. St. John and are
more inclined to his teachings.
Arrangements are being made to-night
by the county committeemen to meet the
delegates who arrive to-morrow morning
and at noon and give them an escort to
their hotels or to the hall. The delegates
are to be provided with white badges. The
alternates will also have seats in the hall.
The galleries have been reserved for the
spectators..
It was announced yesterday at the meet
ing of the Equal Suffrage Club of this city
that Mrs. Susan B. Anthony and other
leaders in the woman suffrage movement
in this State would be here to-morrow to
attend the Prohibition Convention. A
committee was appointed from the club
members to entertain the ladies during
their stay in this city.
L. Ewing of Colfax and a delegation
from that section arrived on a late train
to-night.
WILL PICNIC NEAR LODI
Outing of the San Joaquln County Amer
ican Protective Association.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 12.â There will
be a monster picnic to-morrow at the
grove near Lodi by the members of the
American Protective Association of this
county. Committees have been at work
for the past few weeka in every town in
tbe county arranging for the big affair.
Mayor H. N. Baggs of this city is to be
president of the day, and the services of
Oregon Saunders have been secured as the
orator for the occasion. A train load ol
people will co from here and more will fol
low in bunnies. A barbecue has been ar
ranged, together with the usual picnic
programme of games. The City Council
of Stockton will probably attend in a body
at the invitation of Mayor Baggs. A dele
gation is expected from Sacramento.
NASHES THROUGH A WINDOW
A Jiunaway Ilorte Jlringt Up in the Son
Joaquin Valley lianit]
STOCKTON, Cal., May 12.â Ahorse took
fright on El Dorado street, two blocks from
the principal street of the city, this after
noon, and started west at his best speed.
He turned into Weber avenue and thence
into the plaza. Bam Smi'h, a farm laborer,
had hold of the reins, but he could do
nothing with the animal. After narrowly
missing several vehicles tbe horse ran
headlong toward the San Joaquin Valley
Bank on Main street. He did not "top on
reaching the sidewalk, but dashed into
the plate-glass window of the bank.
Through this he went and into the bank
before he could be checked.
The startled bank officials sprang from
their desks as they saw the horse cominc
through the window, but the animal did
not reach the counters of the institution
before he fell bleeding. He was pulled up
and got out of the Place with some diffi
culty. No one was injured, not even the
man who was driving, as he had slipped
out of the light wagon before it reached
the bank window.

WASHINGTON REPUBLICANS.
Silver Men Will Force an Issue in the
Everett Convention.
SEATTLE, Wash., May 12.â 0f 402
delegates to the Republican State Conven
tion at Everett on Thursday, fully 250 are
in this city to-night. The corridors of
Hotel Butler, where the various county
caucuses are being held, are thronped by
politicians. Slates and combinations are
being made, many no doubt only to be
broken.
John S. McMillan of Roche Harbor ap
pears to be in the lead for chairman of the
convention and his selection will mean a
victory for the "sound" money men, his
financial views, it is reported, being in en
tire accord with that element of the party
in this State. There is a marked disposi
tion on the part of the so-called go'.dbugs
not to touch upon the money question n
the State platform, but unquestionably a
fight will be forced by the silver men.
Nothing relative to the convention seems
so certain as this result, for the white
metal champions are on the aggressive and
claim they will be able to pass a resolu
tion embodying their sentiments.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 13, 1896.
THE SAN JOSE
CONVENTION
County Supervisors Favor
Convict Labor on
Highways.
WIDE TIRES DEMANDED
The Legislature Petitioned to Ac
cept the I,ooo,ooo Acre Arid
Land Grant.
NEED OF SPECIAL DISTRICTS.
Plan by Which Property-Holders
Can Make Necessary Im
provements,
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 12.â The State
Convention of the County Boards of Super
visors this morning discussed the con
struction of county roads and the advan
tage of working convicts in building them.
C. L. Taylor of San Francisco presented
a paper on San Francisco County rouds.
He stated that prison labor was employed
very advantageously on the county roads,
at a great saving to taxpayers and a
benefit morally and physically to the
prisoners. A delegate from Santa Cruz
stated that prisoners could generally not
be worked at distant points from the jail
on account of lacK of facilities. J. S. Selby
of Santa Clara related the experience in
Santa Clara County, which be said was
profitable. He thought that new moun
tain roads could be better worked by the
prisoners than valley roads.
Mr. Mason of the. State Bureau of High
ways said the criminal element was grow
ing to an unnatural proportion in Califor
nia, which was in part due to a hick of j
punishment inflicted, and that the prison
ers are permitted to live in greater luxury
than some taxpayers. They should pay
back the cost of their maintenance, but
they should not be permitted to antagonize
free labor. The State had recently ac
quired property on one of the forks of the I
American River, and a bridge across the
stream is much needed. Steel or iron
would cost too much and be wasteful, but
a magnificent stone bridge should be built
there with prison labor. A quarry nearby I
would give work for a year, and the build
ing of the bridge would take another year.
It would be enduring for centuries. Mr. j
Manson suegested that the Legislature be
petitioned to enact favorable measures.
S. F. Ayer of this county stated that in
his opinion prison labor was not profit
able, as it came too much in conflict with
free labor.
Dimond of San Francisco said it was
not a fair comparison to use San Fran
cisco as a basis, for there they work fifty or
sixty prisoners with three or four guards,
whereas in otner counties there need be as
many jjnards as prisoners.
Woodward of ix>s Angeles favored
prison labor on the highways as a solution
of the tramp problem.
Henderson of Stockton thought prison
ers could be profitably employed if they
could be committed to jail, but the Jus
tices keep turning them loose and the
constables are continually rearresting
them.
A resolution petitioning the Legislature
to enact laws permitting the working of
county prisoners at rock-breaking, road
building, etc., when not antagonistic to
free labor, was almost unanimously passed.
Mr. Buibick and Major Sherman of
Oakland addressed the convention on the
jubilee celebration of the raising of the
American flag at Monterey by Commodore
Sloat July 7, 1846. Tbe event will be a
continuous entertainment from July 4 to
July 7, including naval and land sham
battles, boatraces, etc. The Supervisors
were particularly asked to have every one
of the fifty-eight counties contribute a
stone for the monument being erected at
Monterey in memory of Commodore Sloat,
and to name a young lady as maid of
honor to the California Queen who will
preside over the celebration. Tbe Super
visors from the various counties agreed to
act as requested.
The discussion of the cost of feeding
prisoners showed that it ranged variously
from lOcents per day in Sacramento County
to 50 cents perday in San Mateo County.
An invitation was accepted to visit the
Normal School to-morrow morning, after
which a drive in the country will be taken.
The Nicaragua canal resolutions were
passed with slight amendment
A paper was read by M. B. Ivory advo
cating the building of electric roads on the
sides of highways and not in the center of
the roadways.
Resolutions were adopted in favor of
petitioning the Legislature to accept the
grant of 1,000,000 acres of arid land of tho
public domain made by the last United
States Congress to California; that the
money derived from its sale be used in the
betterment of the State highways; that
the Legislature be requested to enact a
law regulating the width of all tires of
wheeled vehicles, based upon their carry
ing capacities; thanking the Board of
Public Highways for its manifest interest
in the convention, and favoring the con
tinuance of convict labor in preparation of
road material at Folsoin.
A resolution favoring the appointment
of a committee to present the resolutions
passed by the convention to the next Legis
lature was adopted, and Chairman Green
inger named Supervisors Ayer, Field, Hoi
brook, Henderson and Church.
The 'ollowing resolution, introduced by
Woodward of Los Anjreles, was adopted :
Whereas, Under the existing statute there is
no remedy for the property-holders along the
line of any road, or adjacent thereto, to make
necessary improvements to said roads as they
in their judgment may deem requisite for the
advancement of their interests; therefore be it
Resolved, That itjs the sense of this conven
tion of Supervisors of the various counties 'of
tbe State, assembled in the city of San Jose on
May 12, 1896, that the Legislature be peti
tioned to enact a iaw providing that when a
majority of the property-owners by petition in
due form request that they be set aside into
a special district, the Board of Supervisors,
may, in their judgment, form such a district
consisting of all property abutting or contigu
ous thereto along the proposed line of road to
be opened, constructed or improved, and said
district shall include all property as may be
directly benefited by such improvement.
The Board of Supervisors .shall levy a tax
not to exceed $1 on the $100 of assessed valu
ation of all property in said special district, in
addition to all other taxes levied, and said tax
(â¢halt be collected at the same time and in the
same manner as other taxes until said im
provementnt is completed.
R. C. Twine of the State Bureau of High
ways introduced the following resolution,
which was adopted after an animated dis
cussion :
Whereas, Many of the older States are mak
lngTapid advancement in the construction of
roads under tne supervision of State Superin
tendents and State aid; therefore be it
Resolved, That we recommend to the Legisla
ture the passage of such laws as will enable
the various Boards of Supervisors to classify
the roads into three classes, to wit: State high
ways, county thoroughfares and district roads;
State roads to be built and maintained by the
3tate at large; county thorouehf ares to be built
and maintained by a tax on all the property in
each county, and the district roads to be built
ana maintained by tax on property in said dis
tricts.
Los Angeles was chosen as the place for
holding the next annual convention. The
convention will adjourn sine die at noon
to-morrow.

CHRISTIAN INDEAPORERS
Delegates Arriving for the Xlnth Annual
Convention.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 12.â dele
gates to the ninth annual convention of
the State Christian Endeavor Societies
are beginning to arrive, and it is estimated
that the attendance will be larger than at
auy previous session. The society has a
membership of 50,000 in about 1100 so
cieties in the States, and it is believed
that the number of delegates in attend
ance will be nearly 2000. Admission to
the big pavilion where the exercises are to
be held will be free. Music will be fur
nished by the Oakland First Congrega
tional Church orchestra and the San Jose
Chorus Choir, and these features alone
will be sufficient to crowd the building
during the sessions.
The convention will begin with a meet
ing Thursday evening and will continue
until Sunday.
INDE RE N IN A WRECK
Cotvin McÃride Sues the Southern Pacific
for Damages.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 12.â Colvin G.
H. McÃride, a prominent society young
man of this city, to-day began suit against
the Southern Pacific ana the South Pacific
Coast Railroad Companies for $50,000 dam
ages, alleged to have been sustained in
tbe railroad collision between the narrow
gauge and broad-gauge trains at Santa
Clara on January 25.
McÃride alleges that by the collision,
caused by the negligence of defendants,
he sustained a ruptured left groin, a se
verely wrenched ankle and other bruises
and strains, and a severe shock to his
nervous system. He claims he will be a
sufferer frÂ»r life and partially incapacitated
from attending to business.
DELEGATES ARE ARRIVING
Rally of the A. P. A. Men for
the Council Meeting at
Washington.
Friends of Linton Line Up for the
Struggle Against Major Mc-
Kinley.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 12.âNot
withstanding an amount of secrecy un
usual in political assemblages is being ob
served by the members of the A. P. A.,
now about to commence work in this city,
one fact is very much in evidence and that
is that the delegates to the assemblage are
very much in earnest in their respective
opinions as to what course their associa
tion shall determine upon for ita future
welfare.
Delegates have been arriving all day,
and to-night the National Hotel, which is
their headquarters, presents a very ani
mated congregation of men with A. P. A.
buttons on the lapels of their coats, and
all of them indisposed to enter nto con
versation that would throw much light
upon what is about to hnppen in the con
sultations of their order.
It is evident that there are many
aggressively strong McKinley men among
the delegates of his politjfal faith, but it is
also noticeable that Linton buttons shine
on many br<.a3ts with no little emphatic
aggressiveness. The entire proceedings
to-day have been devoid of any very parti
cular interest. The advisory ' board's
movement against Major McKinley is not
likely to be considered until Thursday.

TO CLOSE ARE SESSION
Topic* Before the Jiepublican Steering
' . Committee.
WASHINGTON, 'D. C, May ; 12.-The
Republican Senatorial steering committee
will meet to-morrow to consider the order
of business and arrange for the closing of
the session. There is a difference of opin
ion among the members of that commit
tee as to what should be done with the bill
to repeal the free alcohol clause of the
present tariff act, but the best information
is that the majority of the committee will
recommend to the Republican caucus that
the bill be passed. - â¢
Immigration, bankruptcy, refunding; of
the Pacific;, roads and several other
measures are being championed by various
Senators, but it is nut thought that any of
those will be taken up unless it be for the
purpose of making speeches while appro
priation bills are in conference. Owing to
delay in passing the . river and harbor Dili
the adjournment of the Senate, by mutual
consent, appears to have been advanced a
week, and the -leaders now- say that the
end . will hardly come before ; the Btb of

RECENT EVENTS
IN THE ORIENT
The Russo-Japanese Under
standing With Regard
to Korea.
AN ILLOGICAL COMPACT.
Frightful Fall Over a Precipice
of a Missionary Who Was
Cycling.
BOAT UPSET ON THE YANGTSE.
Forty Persons Drownei â The Coptic
Breaks the Recordâ Nanking to
Have a Mint.
TOKIO, Japan, April 26.â An entente
has been established between Japan and
Russia with reference to Korean affairs.
The details of the arrangement have not
been definitely settled, but its general out
lines are that the two powers will hence
forwurd co-operate to preserve good order
in Korea.
Tne importance of the event in its bear
ings upon the peace of the Orient cannot
be overestimated, but from a historical
point of view it presents some singular
features. An inevitable outcome of the
interference of Russia, German y and
France last year in the matter of
Liaotung, it is at the same time
diametrically opposed to the avowed pur
pose of that interference. The three
powers insisted that Japan must retire
from her newly acquired positions along
the Yalu, on the littoral of the Yellow
Sea and at the entrance of the Gulf of
Pechili, because, thus posted, she would
have K'>rea at her mercy, and tho inde-Â»
pendence of the little kingdom would be
illusory. In a word, Russia, Germany
and France came upon the stage as assert
ers of Korean independence. Their logical
sequence of procedurfl would have been
to practically guarantee that, indepen
denceâto convert Korea into the Belgium
of the East. But they were not logical.
They confined themselvss to a step that
merely crippled Japan's controlling in
fluence in Korea without providing any
efficient substitute for it.
A terrible bicycline accident happened
on the road from Fukui to Tsuruza, on the
west coast of Japan, on the 14th of April.
The Rev. J. B. Porter, a Kioto mission
ary, who was bicycling towaid Tsuruga,
fell over a cliff some 350 feet high. A
Japanese postman saw the accident and
hastened to give the alarm, soon collect
ing two parties of Japanese, one to pro
ceed by boat along the coast, the other to
follow the road over the cliff. The former
found the unfortunate gentleman and
carried him to a hospital. He was seri
ouily injured, but his recovery is not de
spaired of.
Hand-musters of new leaf that have
arrived Yokohama indicate that this
year's crop of Japan tea will probably be
superior to that of last year in luster and
flavor.
The Occidental and Oriental steamer
Coptic, which arrived in Yokohama on
April 22, made the record voyage for her
line from San Francisco, her time being
13 days, 15 hours and 33 minutes.
The great English firm of Jardine,
Miitheson & Co. have secured the first
contract in connection with Chinese rail
way construction â 10,000 casks of Portland
cement and 2200 tons of steel rails and
fastenings.
China's chances of acquiring a good pos
tal service have boen immensely improved
by the appointment of Sir Robert Hart to
bs Postmaster-General of tne empire.
The attention of foreign merchants in
China has been drawn to the fact that
whereas the Japanese in Formosa collect
only $1 12 export duty per picul on tea,
Chinese tea exported from Amoy has to
pay $3 84 per picul. Shippers of Oolong
from Amoy are very closely touched by
this difference, which must eventually tell
materially in favor of the Formosan prod
uct.
The new French Consul and Madame
Haas, on their way up the river to Chung
king, had a vivid experience of the dan
gers of Yangtse navigation. A boat car
rying some sixty people foundered in full
view and only twenty were rescued from
the swift current.
It is noted in Peking that the Emperor of
China has not resumed his English studies,
which were interrupted by the war with
Japan.
A significant and terrible incident is re
ported from Peking. Recently a young
eunucti named Kan, who had graduated
at the Tientsin College, prepared a mem
orial, setting forth in strong terms the
faults of the Emperor and the Empress
Dowager. He presented it to the latter,
and the imperial lady, haying receivedjhis
assurance that the document emanated
from himself, and having seen him in
dorse it, ordered him to be bound and
executed. The youth's only fault was that
he desired to see abuses corrected. He is
not iikely to hnd imitators.
Hopes are not high as to the beneficent
influence of the re-established reform
society in Peking. Its head and founder,
Mr. Wen Jingshih, has been banished
from the capital and permanently dis
qualified for holding office. That he bad
given injudicious license to his tongue
there can be no doubt, but an idea pre
vails that t i.c gravamen of his offense was
anxiety for reform.
The Viceroy of the Liangkiang has con
trncted with the Shanghai firm of Buch
heister & Co. for the erection of a mint at
Nanking, Inside the city, for silver and
copper coinage. According to accounts
published in Shanghai the mint will be
capable of turning out 100,000 silver coins
and 1,000,000 copper cash a day. Tue
silver coins will be dollars exactly equiva
lent to Mexicans.
In Shantung the results of t lie war with
Japan are depicted in roughly sketched

COUNTER TENOR WINS
Defeats Sir Walter and inhry fast Ones,
in the. Handicap.
MORRIS PARK RACE TRACK, N. V.,
May 12. â The Metropolitan handicap was
the attraction on this the opening day,
and the fact that Henry of Navarre did
not start was something of a disappoint
ment. The start hi the big event was not
an exceptionally good one. Hornpipe
took command, closely followed by Sir
Walter, with the rest bunched. They ran
in this order to the hill top, where Sir
Walter showed a bit in front of Hornpipe.
The rest were about two lengths away.
Rounding for home, Hornpipe showed
signs of distress, and Sir Walter turned
for borne with a good lead, soon killing off
Rubicon. He was challenged a sixteenth
from tue grand stand, however, by Counter
Tenor and St. Maxim, and a lighting finish
resulted, Counter Tenor winning by a
head from the fast-coming St. Maxim,
who was only a head in advance of Sir
Walter.

.Veto Target Rules.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 12.â Secretary
Schaefer or the California Inanimate
Target Association to-day issued a circular
letter calling on the delegates to the board
of governors of the association to meet
here next Sunday to consider matters per
tair.ing to the tournament to be held here
on May 30 and 31. One of the most im
portant matters that will come up for con
sideration will be the taking up of an
amendment tr> tbe by-lawsof the organiza
tion. This will be inserted for the purpose
of determining wnat are correct and wtiat
are not proper records in gun club shoots,
and will be a very good addition to the
working rules of tbe associarion. This
amendment will provide for a committee
on records, to consist of three members,
each from a aifferent club, who must pass
on any State record made by a member of
any club that belongs to the association.
It also provides thafa suitable gold medal
shall be given to any one making a new
State record for consecutive breaks in any
match of the association.
Baseball at Portland.
PORTLAND. Ob., May 12.â Admirers of
the National game had an opportunity to
day to contribute their mite to the Harry
Wright monument fund. The grounds
were in better shape than at any time
since the new Pacific League season
opened, but tne attendance was scarcely
3<jO. The Portland Gladiators met a team
of old amateur club players â semi-profes
sionals â who have been waiting for a
month for a game. The amateurs were easy
marks for the professionals. The game
was slow and tame.

WEDNESDAY MAY 13, 1896
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Populism is willing to absorb Democ
racy, but it won't fuse.
The Omaha platform is too big for the
Democratic donkey to pull into camp.
The trouble with the Junta is that it
takes itself by the throat too seriously.
Greater New York seems to have taken
in most everything, but Chicago isn't in it.
"Get thee behind me, Satan," say the
Populists, and Democracy goes to the
rear.
There will be no withdrawals from the
race at St. Louisâ all the favorites are
stayers.
It is about time for the Senate Finance
Committee to begin to turn the cathode
ray on the bond deals.
It may be overwork that fatigues Cleve
land, but it is his apparent lack of vigor
that makes the people tired.
Until the Si. Louis convention has done
its wort there will hardly be anything else
worth talking about in this country.
Colorado will go to St. Louis resolute for
free silver, and she will find California
ready to stand with her in the tight.
This is a good year for political revivals,
as 81l the converts will come into the party
of patriotism, protection and prosperity.
Sacramento may be proud of two of her
political conventions this year, but over
the third one she may have to draw a veil.
If Senator Frye would take a look at the
mart he would see that after ail Mr. Hunt
ington is not so big as the whole of Cali
fornia.
It is high time for some Senator to make
a speech and tell the country what the
Senate has done to earn its salary this
session.
The proposed fiesta is beginning to
assume the shape of a definite promise,
and we may get it in September as a relief
from politics.
From this time on whenever a Chicago
man goes to New York he will speak of it
as a rustication among the truck gardens
and dairy farms.
The fiesta idea in San Francisco should
be realized before this year's flowers fade
even if we have to make it a fiesta of
chrysanthemums.
It is very difficult to find just now in
any part of the country a Democratic news
paper that is giving any of its valuable
space to Democratic politics.
Now that a plan for a park for the Mis
sion district has been brought forward it
should be kept to the front until it has
Been successfully carried out.
It is becoming more and more evident
that if Oinej should make a good strike
before the Chicago convention meets
Cleveland would try tor the third base.
Now tnat the proposed early adjourn
ment of Congress has become uncertain
the defeat of the funding bill is also un
certain, and the thing needs more watch
ing. ____*____
The little flurry with Spain comes just
in time to point out the folly of the Senate
,m trying to cut down the appropriations
for the navy from four new battle-ships to
two.
With Populists as with Republicans,
straight politics is the best policy this
year. It is only demoralised Democracy
that can gain anything by crooked com
bines.
The Queen Regent says Bpain will not
abandon the mission of civilization she
has taken upon herself, but really it would
be better abandoned than turned into a
Cuban butcher-shop.
Wi erever Californians meet in any
assembly in these days the funding
scheme is denounced, and, still there are
people who profess to doubt if that is the
real sentiment of the State.
It was quite appropriate in the Super
visors of the State at their good roads con
vention to denounce the refunding scheme,
as the best way to improve the Central
Pacific road is to foreclose the mortgage
and break down the monopoly.
Over $2,000,000 la gold was withdrawn
from the treasury for export ou Monday
and the surplus in the reserve is rapidly
diminishing. We may have another bond
issue to reckon with before we get through
with the one more year of Grover.
Senator Hili has arranged that the Dem
ocratic State Convention in New York
shall be held after all other State conven
tions are otfer, and it is easy to understand
what he did it for. Nobody is going to
make him leap before he looks this time.
It is reported from Berlin that the
Reichstag has decided to limit the output
of sugar this year to 17,000,000 double cent
ners. This is intended, of course, to keep
the price up, but it won't hurt us. While
they are raising prices we can be raising
eugar.
A METROPOLITAN FETE.
Stirred at last to activity by the bril
liancy and success of the carnivals which
nearly every other city and town in the
State has held, or is preparing to hoid,
San Francisco has begun a movement to
have a great carnival of its own. Very
properly the sentiment ol the initial meet
ing waÂ§ that the event be set for tl.e au
tumn, as all the other cities hold theirs in
the spring, when flowers are in the height
of their glory. The San Francisco affair
must be essentially different from all the
others by reason of the fact tbat a floral
festival would not be as appropriate here
as in the interior cities, which have more
room for the cultivation cf flowers.
The bodies represented at the meeting
held Monday evening at the Baldwin
Hotel were the State Development Society,
the State Board of Trade, the Commercial
Travelers' Association, the Native Sons of
the Golden West, the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association, the California
Hotel Association and the Geographical
Society of the Pacific. That was an excel
lent start. In addition to these, the com
mittee appointed to arrange a plan of per
manent organization and to report at the
meeting to be held at the Baldwin next
Monday evening contains members repre
senting the Merchants' Association, the
Half-million Club, the Chamber of Com
merce, the Liquor-dealers' Association
and the San Francisco Stock Exchange.
Doubtless the central managing commit
tee, which the permanent organization
will appoint, will include still other civic
bodies working for the general good in va
rious directions.
The great problem to be solved is the
kind of festival to hold. Manifestly it
would be neither wise nor appropriate to
have a flower carnival. An industrial fete
would be an incongruous idea, and that
point has been already covered by arrange
ments for the great joint exhibition in
September. As considerations of spectac
ular effects cannot be left out of the ac
count a grand carnival in which games
would be a leading feature would seem to
be appropriate, with such incidents as
splendid fireworks and a night of masquer
ade jollity. .
Or it might be well to make the cele
bration of the National holiday the central
idea of tlie fete. By a fortunate accident
the Fourth of July this year falls on Satur
day, which is the proper day for bringing
such a carnival to a close. The only diffi
culty would be that as carnivals keep their
masquerade feature for the close there
might be objection to winding up the event
with a masquerade on the evening of the.
Fourth after a grand patriotic celebration
in the daytime. Besides all that, San
Francisco is usually more windy and foggy
in July than in any other month. The
pleasantest days of the year fall in the
late autumn.
Whatever may be the decision of the
managers, they will assume a great re
sponsibility, though no fear tbat they will
overlook that fact need be entertained.
A COMMERCIAL PESTILENCE.
The Wilson-Gorman tariff act has
proven itself to be a veritable commercial
pestilenceâ a pestilence that eats into the
vitals of the country's trade, traffic and
industries. Practically every line of busi
ness has been seriously weakened by its
poisonous touch, but none have suffered
more at its devouring hands than the
farmer and the industrial operative. It is
claimed by the friends of the bili that by
putting the one item of wool on the free
list a great saving is made in the cost of
woolen goods to the consumer, which is
true as far a3 it goes, but they fail to point
out how losses are incurred by the opera
tion of the bill in other directions, which
a great deal more than counterbalances
the alleged saving. The fact is, by reason
of the Democratic tariff, or rather because
of the absence of a proper tariff, which
permits British-made woolen soods to
enter our markets, our home mills do uot
get orders for more if as much as 75 per
cent of their capacity.
The consequence of this is that our
woolen-mill operatives are on one-half to
three-quarters time, which in turn reduces
their income exactly in the same ratio,
which in turn again is reflected in the
markets where they purchase their sup
plies. Does it pay a man to lie idle from
three to six months in the year to save
probably $20 in a year's supply of woolen
goods? Does it pay a farmer to let his
surplus produce rot in the field or in the
granary in order to save perhaps $25 on
his woolen goods purchases in a whole
year? But that is exactly the way the
Wilson-Gorman bill works.
And what is true of woolen goods is true
of nearly every other line of manufacture.
Fqreign manufacturers are not only in
vifed by the Wilson-Gorman act to come
in competition with our home industries,
but they are enabled to fix the price at
which our mills shall sell their product.
Now, the inevitable consequence of the
continuation of the Democratic alleged
tariff act will be to either shut up our in
dustries or reduce the wages of their oper
atives to a level with the wage schedules
of the old country. In fact, that would
have been done on the very day that the
present tariff act became a law but for the
faith manufacturers had in the good sense
of the people of America to right the
great wrong done them by the Democratic
party at the very next National election.
That the people will overthrow free trade
and again place the country where Presi
dent Harrison left it there is not the
shadow of a doubt, but what is every
body's business is nobody's business,
hence The Call urges those who are more
anxious about the prosperity of their own
country than about how Europe is getting
on, to begin now to organize for the No
vember battle.
A PROPOSED REFORM
The Merchants' Association of Los An
geles, supported by the Board of Trade
and Chamber of Commerce of that city,
has begun an agitation in favor of a reform
in the method of assessing and collecting
taxes In this State. The object of tiie re
form is to remove evils in the present sys
tem and provide for greater equity in
assessments and greater simplicity, direct
ness and economy in both assessing and
collecting.
The plan favored by the association is
the adoption by California of the tax sys
tem now in use in Ohio. It has been
tested there by the practice of many years,
and is reported to be on the whole more
satisfactory to the taxpayers and more
economical to the government than that
which prevails in most other American
commonwealths. For the purpose of edu
cating the people on the subject, a small
pamphlet by T. W. Brotherton of Los
Angeles has been published, giving a brief
outline of the proposed reform, and is be
ing wideiy circulated.
Under the plan proposed the County and
City Treasurers act as tax collectors for
their respective corporations, and the
County Auditor acts as Assessor. When
the returns of the assessments are made
they are open for inspection at the Audi
tor's office, and any exceptions to valua
tions can De appealed to the Supervisors.
A State board revise* the tax returns of
THE SAN FRAXCISCU CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 13, 1896.
all counties so as to equalize them, and
the valuation thus fixed remains the same
for ten years unless some special cause oc
curs for making a change. If ten years
should be too lone a time for California a
rive years' term could be fixed. Where any
cause for cnange in valuation, such as a
fire, the erection of new buildings, the
opening of new roads, occurs, a board con
sisting of the Couuty Auditor and the
Supervisors acts as a board of equalization
in revising it.
The benefits to be derived from the
change are the decrease in the number of
officials, the simplicity of the work, the
economy it establishes and the relief of the
taxpayer from the labor, confusion and
loss which now results from a search in
various offices located in different places to
ascertain how much he m3y owe to State,
county, city or assessment districts.
The subject is one that can hardly es
cape the consideration of intelligent tax
payers and the Merchants' Association of
Los Angeles has certainly done well in
bringing that consideration to the point of*
regarding the subject as one of practical
politics at this time. We are about to
elect a new Legislature and the lawmakers
of the State will assemble next winter. If
we are to have relief from the existing
evils of tax assessments and collections
this is certainly the time to discuss the
form it is to take.
A CLEAR RESOLUTION.
With but two dissenting votes the State
Convention of Boards of Supervisors of
California has passed & resolution pro
testing against the passage of a railroad
refunding bill by Congress. A significant
feature ot the matter is that this subject
wa3 not embraced in the call for the con
vention, and that although an effort was
made to shut it out on that ground the
convention decided that it had a right to
assume the privilege of expressing its
opinion.
The value of such an opinion from
such a source must not be underval
ued. County Supervisors, more clearly
than any other public officers, represent
the producing classes, the men of brawn
and character who regard politics as a
means to a worthy end and who constitute
the backbone of prosperity and sound
public sentiment. They are directly con
cerned with public affairs bearing on the
fundamental principles of the general
welfare. In California they fully under
stand the railroad question, having no
delusions, cherishing no prejudices and
serving no private or political interest aa
a class. The men whom they elect as
Supervisors are strictly representative of
them and are selected with great care.
These boards arÂ« composed of men repre
senting all parties. In every phase of a
broad question they reflect the opinions
held by the sober^ntelligence and earnest
patriotism of the State.
For such a eathering of public officers to
pass such a resolution as that which was
adopted at San Jose last Monday is the
most significant of all the indications
which have appeared to make known
wishes of the people of California. It was
as follows:
Whereas, a bill is now before Congress to
refund the debts of the defaulting Govern
ment-aided overland railways; and whereas,
the enactment of the bill will" work a hardship
on the State of California and on the territory
tributary to said railways.
Resolved, That the boards of County Super
visors of the State of California in convention
assembled strongly protest against the enact
ment of said refunding bill, and request all
members of the Fifty-fourth Congress friendly
to the Pacific Coast to vote against it. What
ever may oe their opinions as to the policy of
permitting the Government to own and oper
ate railways, there should be no difference of
opinion as to the impartial treatment of cor
porations or citizens in our courts of law. To
recognize by legislation that there is one law
for the poor and another for the rich Is to in
vite anarchy and bloodshed. Tho courts
should be permitted to settle the question in
accordance with the law, and it does not follow
that foreclosure must be followed by Govern
ment operation of the railways thus acquired.
On the contrary, it is evident that they can be
sold or leased to far better advantage than as
now operated, both to the United States Gov
ernment and to the people who are dependent
upon them lor transportation.
Resolved, That attested copies of this resolu
tion be sent to the President of the United
States and to the California delegation in the
Fifty-fourth Congress.
It will be interesting to note how Mr.
Huntington will attempt to explain this
resolution on the ground already taken by
him that only a few "professional agitators
and irresponsible newsoapers" in Califor
nia offer any objection to the scheme
which would give him complete domina
tion over the welfare of California for a
century to come. The farmers of this
State, who are strictly represented by the
Boards of Supervisors, know too well what
that would mean. They can judce future
burdens by those which they have been
comDelied to bear in the past. The digni
fied tone of the resolution and its manly
reasons for declining to raise the issue of
Government ownership deprive funding
advocates of every possible excuse to
charge "professional agitators" with its
inspiration.
"THE WEEKLY CALL."
The most imjiortani telegraphic news
will always be found in a condensed form
in The Weekly Call, in addition to
editorials and local news. In nearly all
other departments the Weekly represents
the result of a week's newsgathering. in a
comprehensive manner.
The agricultural department is prepared
with a view of treating intelligently con
ditions peculiar to California, supple
mented always with the result of agricul
tural experiments in other States. This
department is peculiarly complete, ana. by
reason of its treatment of local features,
of unusual merit. All departments of
farm work are treated, and attention is
Given to the orchard, the farm, the dairy,
the apiary, the garden and the poui try
yard.
The page devoted to mining news is also
comprehensive, and presents more infor
mation concerning California mines and
minerals than may be found in any other
paper on the coast.
The issue for the current week appears
this morning, and a study of it will show
how thoroughly it covers all points of the

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Captain Guy Howard of the United Btates
army, son of General O. O. Howard, arrived at
the Occidental Hotel from the East last night.
Captain Howard, whose father made such a
notable record as an Indian fighter and in the
War of the Rebellion, is a tall, athletic appear
ing man. His hair is brown and his mustache
a demi-Dlonde, while his features are clear cut
and what may be called hnudsome. He wears
a long overcoat, moves with a sweeping stride
and carries a healthy looting walking stick.
He is very tall.
Captain Howard gets around like a man who
has many things to do and was thinking of

many things. With his friend, Mr. Frost, Ir e " ,
night, be walked to and fro and discussed the j
things that were new on the coast since he left.
It is said that he is interested in mining in
Colorado and also in the Sierras and altogether
Is much like Jesse R. Grant in his tastes for
digging for silver and gold. He is credited
with being a skilled mlnin-? engineer
He will be in ban Frano'sco for some time.
Manuel Casin, the bold freebooter who sailed
some months ago with Antonio Ezeta on the
Barclay Golden on a conquest of Salvador, is
keeping out of tne way of the multitudes in
this City and lamenting his losses on the re
cent filibustering trip. Cabin no longer haunts
| the corridors of the leading hotels, as afore-
I time. His exchequer is said to be in a sadly
I depleted state. Casin say- himself he sank
I twenty thousand dollars on the trip. Time
j was when Casin was in it big in
i Salvador. He had all the concessions for
I making aguadiente. and be made a lot of it,
and sold- it at big prices. Aguadiente is the
Spanish liquor which in Salvador is as much
prized as bonrbon is in certain parts of this
fair land. Many was the gooa dollar that
Casin raked in from hi? big distillery monop
oly, bnt Casin could give the people cards and
spades on several other things besides the
aguadient* business. He had the whole con
cessions for furnishing guns and uniforms and
other supplies to the troops of Salvador.
He knew how to make hay when the sun
shone, and according to the gossip afloat he
made a large harvest. Some two years ago
Casin, frebh from the scenes of his triumph* in
Salvador, put up at the Palace Hotel. An en
emy ot the bold Casin was also in this City,
named Andres Amayo, and the two gentlemen
soon had the town notified that they were
looking for each other's blood. Casin's quar
ters were fortified by a couple of gleaming Win
chesters and a brace of blazing pistols. The ter
rible Amayo was quartered In a house on Cali
fornia street. Both breathed forth threaten
ings and slaughter and went into the daily
press to emphasize their contempt for each
other, but they never shot, and those who were
hourly looking on and anticipating a tragedy
were forced to swallow their disappointment.
Now Amayo li on top in Salvador, and Casin,
whose rich red blood boiled within him, is ly
ing low in San Francisco, waitiug for a turn of
tho wheel.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
THE LION IN THE WAY.
President of the Tri-County W. C. T. U.
Criticizes Joaquiu Miller.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sib:
Mr. Miller's lecture on "Tho Lion in the Way,"
given at Pacific Grove under the auspices of
the W. C. T. U., was very severely criticised by
the convention and the audience. Knowing
that Mr. Miller had been giving lectures before
teachers' institutes which were well received,
he was invited in good faith to lecture at the
grove. Mr. Miller promised a "suitable lec
ture," and from hia standpoint it might seem
so, but from the standpoint of the W. C. T. U.
it was a direct blow to their work, the purpose
and spirit of which he most certainly does not
understand or appreciate.
A letter from Mr. Miller in reply to one ask
ing some explanation says: "An easy thing it
has been to cry against wine; my war cry is
against intern iterance. 1 have worked long
and bard, especially in Great Britain, on this
line, and as I have the approval of great and
good men there, as well as my own conscience
entirely, lam content to leave the rest to
Him."
Mr. Miller's war cry against intemperance
was greatly misunderstood by the audience.
It sounded like a plea for the wine industry.
The greatest "lion" in our way is man him
selfânot "barley fields," nor "bankers," nor
"brokers," but men.
Barley fields and wheat fields and vineyard
could give work to the unemployed through
whose industry the Uttlo ones could be fed,
without turning their product* into a home
destroyer. Banks would become distributing
agencies but for the injustice and greed of
men. Mr. Miller was right in saying "we must
reach the hearts of these men as Jesus did,"
iÂ»nd ir ever a band of fearless Christian work
ers were seeking the Christ way it is the W. C.
Man governs himself by legislation became
of his own undeveloped will, therefore we
seek to protect him by legislation. We never
say a man shall not drink, but we seek to pro
hibit nuisances and death-dealing instrument
alities.
We seek to inspire men who in the full
ripe |age of manhood can be ideals for the
young, towers of strength to the State and so
ciety. Men for whom a pure woman will not
need to blush, whose cowardice she will neither
need to scorn nor to pity. We are not politi
cians, but reformers.
Â°"r present strength as a National and
worldwide society has been attained along the
line of principle, not policy. Our constancy
ana faith aave kept pace with growing needs.
We know the strength of the "lions in the
way. We know of a higher power; in this
we trust. We seek to save each new genera
tion and keep it from blasting every hope of a
true and noble life. We aim to establish the
character of the young upon the principles of
self-control, self-preservation, self-respect. To
build up a strong and noble manhood and
womanhood which shall be the country's
pride, instead of its peril. We work to protect,
preserve and maintain the home and all insti
tutions calculated to enn< ble society.
But the temperance cry of Joaquin
Miller Is not the one at which we rally.
Mrs. E. G. Greene,
President Tri-County W. C. T. U.
Santa Cruz, May 11, 180t>.
PROMOTION IN THE ARMY.
Apparent Injustice ot the System as at
Present Practiced.
To the Editor of the San Francitco Callâ Sib:
In looking over the list of officers in the army
in active service one can but be struck forcibly
by the vicissitudes in promotion there shown.
We can sympathize with the artillery subal
terns in their complaint of unfairness to them
of transferring cavalry and infantry officers to
their corps in any scheme proposed for an in
crease of the artillery arm. Through the pres
ent system of promotion there are six first
lieutenants of artillery that graduated from
West Point in 1867, while among the grad
uates ol 1834 there are four captains in staff
departments, and of the class of 1881 there
are six captain.* and one major in the staff.
There are three first lieutenants of artillery
graduates of 1868, two of 18<>9, five of 1870,
one of 1871, two of 1872, six of 1873, nine of
1874 to two in the infantry, six of 1875 to
two in the infantry, seven of 1876 to 6ix in
the infantry mid cavalry, while every other
graduate of those classes in both infantry and
cavalry are captains or have higher rank.
This apparent injustice seems the more
curious from the fact that at their graduation
the highest in class rank next to filling Vacan
cies in the engineers' department are selected
to fill vacancies in the artillery, and some of
the latter are â¢ scholars â that is, the first five.
This ptar-scholarstiip does not seem to bene
fit so very much when a No. 31 of a class thir
teen years later outranks not only two star
scholars entering the engineers nt graduation,
bnt also every member but two of the earlier
class.
In the list below the first column gives the
present relutlve rank, the second the class
rank and year of graduation, tho third the
relative rank in 1890 of a few of the higher
officers of the army on the active list.

PROGRESS OF EQUAL SUFFRAGE.
Santa Barbara Â£1 Barbereno.
It must be with feelings of gratification that
the noble women, fighting so bravely for suf
frage, view their success. True, their rights
have not yet been accorded them, but on every
hand recruits are found; and it has remained
for California to furnish the first great metro
politan daily paper that dares come out and
take a firm stand for equal suffrage rights for
all the people. The San Francisco Call, one
of the most influential journals of the West,
has declared that woman's suffrage is the com
ing issue; and, moreover, it states the follow
ing: "The Republican party should give a
helping hand to the woman's suffrage move
ment."
Woman's suffrags is becoming popular; the
old, worn-out objections that "women do not
want to vote," tbat the better class of women
would not go to the polls, are heard but sel
dom now, and it is generally acceded that
woman is interested in the government of
our country, which includes herself as well as
her brother; that as property-owners and tax
payers they should share political privileges
equally with men.
In recent conventions resolutions indorsing
the movement have been passed by several
California counties. In San Diego recently
the Republicans gave voice to the following
sentiment: "Resolved, Thai this convention
cordially favors the proposed amendment to
the constitution of California, whereby it is
sought 10 extend the elective franchise to all
citizens, otherwise qualified, without' distinc
tion of sex. and we hereby pledge to It our
support at the polls in the November general
election."
Thus it seems that woman's cause is by no
meunsalost cause, but every duy is gaining
ground.
WAIST WITH FICHU COLLAR.
AND lOOtS THAT MAY BE OMITTED.
Two extremely stylish and novel features are
shown in this waist. The sleeves are fitted
with a very short nuff at the top. The collar
is square in the back, with fichu front. It may
be sewn to the waist or finished with a bias
band to be made removable.
A waist of white lawn had a ruffle of em
broidery on the collnr. Green China ribbon
formed a belt and collar.
A waist of brown mohair worn with!a plain
skirt of the same had a collar of embroidered
batiste over a lining of green taffeta. The same
silk formed two narrow knife-pleated frills all
around the collar, and also finished the neck
and belt.
A waist of Dresden silk had collar of black
mousseline de soie with pleated ruffles of the
same. The collar was uecorated with clover
leaves formed of three leaves of white lace
braid as illustrated here.
The waist is gathered both back and front
over a fitted lining. For wash goods the lining
may be omitted entirely, but the result Is more
satisfactory if a yoke lining is put in the back.

California Purple Finchâ M. S. R., City.
The California purple finch which is found
near Santa Cruz has its habitat on the Pacific
Coast from the Straits of Fuca on the north to
the vicinity of Monterey. It lias not been met
below that line. The first quill is usually
shorter than the fourth in the adult male, with
sides and flunks usunlly strongly though not
sharply streaked with dark. The back is very
indistinctly streaked, the feathers being less
dark than the edges. The red of the crown is
darker than that of the rump. The special
characteristic is the head, with broad supin
orbital lateral band of lighter purple. This
finch is a very fine singer. It has a general
resemblance to the Western chipping sparrow,
but the latter is much smaller than the finch.
Polltax Collectionâ Lumberman, Millwood,
Fresno County, Cal. The law pt-rmits one who
is indebted to another to pay the polltax of
the person to whom he is indebted. In your
communication you say that "we are lumber
men, the men are in the woods during the day,
and scatter at sight of the tax collector." In a
case of that kind how is a collector to make
demand on the parties for their tax? It is be
cause of men, who know that they are In
debted to the State for polltax, sneaking away
when the collector approaches, that the col
lectors make a demand on employers for a list
of men in their employ, and give notice when
the men are at meals that he wants the poll
tax. If they do not pay ho makes a demand
on the employer for the amount of the tax. If
this practice was not within the law it would
have been stopped long ago.
Chineseâ F. M., San Pedro, Cal. The first
Chinese exclusion bill, passed March 24,
1882, was vetoed by President Chester A. Ar
thur April 4, and drawn anew to overcome tha
objections of the President. It became law on
the 6th of May, it being signed by the chief
executive on that day. It is impossible to tell
what the Chinese population was in San Fran
cisco at that time, but It was estimated at
from 30.000 to 35,000. Two years later the
Board of Supervisors undertook to fini out tbo
number of Chinese in the City, and this is
what the special committee reported: "No
known method of census- takiu k hus ever yet
sufficed to furnish an approximate idea even
of the number of our Chinese population."
The committee as a result of its investigation
6tated that at that time, two years after tha
exclusion law had been in operation, the low
est possible estimate it could reach was
30,360.
Teaxsvaal TRorÃLESâ Subscriber, Sacramen
to, Cal. The recent troubles in the Transvaal
arose from the desire of Cecil Rhodes to bring
about certain reforms; the suppression of the
existing Dopper-Boer domination as exempli
fied by President Kruger and his Hollander
allies; the installation of a buffer government
with an executive composed of advanced pro
gressive Boers, to be transitory, with the
object of establishing liberal reforms and the
granting of the franchise to all duly qualified
Uitlanders; the advent of a more enlightened
class of legislators composed of Anglo-Saxon
and Anglo-Dutch element, whose mission it
would be to bring the Transvaal within the
orbit of the customs union as now existing
between the Cape Colony, Nafal and tha
Orange Free State, as a first step toward local
federation; and while retaining its local Inde
pendence of form of government the political,
commercial and social union of the Transvaal
within the area from Tanganyika on the north
to Capetown on the south, and from Delagoa.
Bay on the east to Damaraland on the west,
the whole to be under the Eegis of imperial
British suzerainty. It was against this propo
sition that President Kruger took exception.
Fridayâ N. N.. City. Every country has
special unlucky days. In Christian countries
Friday of every week is the pre-eminently un-
lucky one, probably from tho fact that the
crucifixion is understood to have taken place
on that day. That and the consequent fasts
have made it a marked day in the calendar. To
start any undertaking or commence a journey
on a Friday is, in the minds of many, to court
failure and disaster, but why, those who pre
dict disaster cannot tell. Sailors are particu
larly superstitious as to that day. There was
a man who had an idea that he would turn
that superstition, and he had the keel of a ves
sel laid on a Friday, masts stepped in her on
Friday, her cargo shipped on Friday, found a
man named Friday to command her and
started on the voyage on a Friday. The vessel
never returned to port and never was heard of
again. In old rhyme "Friday's child is loving
and giving," "Cut nails on Friday cut them
for woe," "Friday for losses" and many others.
A great many Important events have occurred
on Friday, and many successful undertakings
have been commenced on that day of the week.

VIRTUOUS BUCKLEYITES
Say They Will Help to
Enforce Civil Ser
vice Reform.
Clevand's Now Order Has a
Big Effect on the Old
Junta.
CHECKUG GAYIS MdAB'S AMBITION.
The Active Buckley Executive Com
mittee Bestows Honors on
Dr. Stanton.
The Buckleyites are going to help the
Civil Service Commission purify and
elevate the Federal service in San Fran
cisco.
The Buckley Democrats are free to do
this. Hardly a mother's son of them has
a Federal job, and as their minds and
motives are not warped by the power of
patronage jobs they are in a position to
extend their interest in good government
to the Federal service.
They think that this late order by Presi
dent Cleveland putting the mints, the in
ternal revenue service and some other
departments in the classified list is a
grand thing, and they hail with joy its
purifying effect in politics.
Now the Junta is, as everybody knows,
built on the Mint and revenue office largely,
with Sam Rainey's Fire Department as
another of the cornerstones, and with the
Custom-house, the Board of Supervisors,
the ambition of Gavin McNab and a few
other little things to provide the rest of
the foundation. The City has never seen
a political machine so thoroughly con
structed of patronage jobs.
Every force that has played to hold to
gether and to operate the machine has
been a patronage one. Whenever McNab
and Suliivan have wanted to run the
machine to grind out something, they
have signaled to patronage powers to
"start."
Daggett and his Mint, working in com
bination with Sam Rainey and his Fire
Department, have been the one big single
force at play. Daggett has used the Mint
in his political work with the Junta as no
boss ever used a Street Department. He
haÂ« discharged men for not doing his bid
ding in local politics, and has sold posi
tions by the dozen to district politicians
whom he needed in his local political
work.
It is true that the powerful Daggett-
Rainey combination has lecently been
shut out of the control of the Junta, which
it so nearly gained by other patronage and
McNah combinations, but Daggett and his
Mint political power is yet an exceedingly
strong factor in the strength of the Junta
machine, and it will be a big factor in the
State Convention when the Buckley con
testing delegation arrives.
In the Junta and composing much of its
political power are politicians holding
jobs in the Custom-bouse, the Internal
Revenue Office and some other Federal de
partments. These Federal office-holders
in the Junta general committee number
some dozens, but as each one has his job
and bis position in the general committee
because he can control other votes a full
majority of the committee of 450 may be
reckoned as controlled by patronage
power.
The civil service rules require public
servants to avoid "pernicious activity,"
"offensive partisanship," membership in
political conventions and so on. So the
civil service order putting so many Junta
politicians under the benefits and penal
ties of that law is about to work a great
revolution in Junta affairs. If the law
works as it is supposed to work the fighters
of the Buckleyites will soon be shorn of
much of their power.
A little army of little politicians op
posed to them because tliev had to be
must quit to a large extent. Becoming se
cure in their positions most of them will
be glad to do so.
That is why all the Buckleyites are in
terested in the operation of the beneficent
civil service law. Cleveland's order
strengthens them and weakens the enemy.
They have taken fresh hope and courage.
Now they propose to see that civil service
people obey the righteous law of the land.
If those fellows don't stay well within
the bounds they will see that they are
made to do so. Politicians who become
civil service people will be watched and
reported to the Civil Service Commission
if they keep on intimidating Democrats,
breaking up the party and all that.
The tight against McNab in the Junta
executive committee was not straightened
out yesterday. It may be before the meet
ing to-night and it may not be.
McNab will not be allowed to name fifty
or more delegates and boss things gener
ally. A majority are out for the right to
run tneir own districts pretty ranch.
McNab'a ambition to name a lot of State
Central Committeemen and to control the
next State Central Committee in partner
ship with Daggett and Sam Rainey is
likely to meet a lot of setbacks.
McNab, it is told, has been going about
town meeting nice big Democrats and tell
ing them that he was going to make them
delegates to the State Central Committee.
There are those who don't like that.
The Buckley executive committee held
a big meeting'at the Market-street head
quarters last night. Chairman Donovan,
Secretary Gavigan, Joseph Rothschild,
James H. O'Brien, J. C. Nealon, M. J.
Nealon, M. J. Fallon and many others
made speeches.
It was decided that Dr. James 1. Stanton,
Railroad Commissioner, should be the
delegate-at-large to the State Convention,
which the local apportionment provides
for.
From all the districts came reDorts that
many more were anxious to go as delegates
than the apportionment allows.
It was reported that a lively correspond
ence witll Democrats throughout the State
was going on, and that it was found tnat
a great many who will likely be at the
Stnte Convention were not predisposed in
favor of McNab, Daggett and the rest of
the Junta.
The Junta, it was said, was making false
pretenses to boom itself and that the fn
terior delegates would listen to evidence
and do what was fair and for the interests
of the party.
Nominations for delegates to the State
Convention will be made by the Buckley
district clubs on Saturday, "the 16th inst.,
at the following places:
Twenty-eighth Districtâ Drew's Hall, new
Montgomery and Howard.

JAPAN'S MIND UNSETTLED

Large Enough for
the Present.
The American Ship-Builders
Return Home Greatly
Disappointed.
THE OREGOI'-AKD HDIAIA COMPARED
General Williams of Cramps Makes
Excuses for the Eastern
Ship.
General Georee B. Williams, represent
ing the Cramps in negotiations with the
Jar>anese Government for the building of
naval ships, arrived on the China yester
day and is stopping at the Palace.
"Japan has nÂ« >t made up her mind in the
matter of a navy," said General Williams
last evening. "It was understood that she
contemplated a big equipment in shins of
war, but that does not seem to be true.
The Japanese have either changed or not
fully made up their mind about it. At
any rate they indicated to us that they
were not prepared to enter into any con
tracts in the matter. All we have done,
therefore, was to lepresentto the authori
ties having to do with the matter what we
could do for them in case they do at some
time want to increase their navy. I have
been over there some two mouths. Mr.
Dickey, representing the Union Iron
Works of San Francisco, was there at the
same time on the same mission, and came
back by the same ship, with, I believe, the
same report."
Speaking about hi** observations in
Japan. General Williams said: "The
Japanese people are not at all inflated ove r
their great success in the recent war. A
great many persmis have asked me if the
people were not disposed to be 'cocky' as
a result. It was to have been expected,
but the fact is that it has had the opposite
effect. It has made them thoughtful. All
the notabies I came in contact with
seemed to ieel a new and sobering sense
of responsibility in their relationship to
the world. The intellectual and commer
cial awakening of Japan has been wonder
ful. I visited the country twenty yeurs
ago. There was then scarcely an engine
in the country. Now there are smoke
stacka everywhere and the whirr of ma
chinery, together with qu>te a system of
railways. The people are studying philo
sophy "and science, and are reasonably
abreast in these things. The spread of
their progress has been wondeiful."
"How about the much-ta!ked-of Japanese
invasion of manufactures in this coun
try?"
"Well a good deal of that is rot. Japan
will be manufacturing more and more of
what she needs as time goes. She will
import less, and so Europe will suffer in
the matter of trade with her. She does
not buy much of us as it is, and so we will
not be injured. I do not think we have
anything to fear from her as a competitor
in our markets. Yes, she Duilds ships of
her own, too, of a certain class, and very
good ones."
Then General Williams was asked if he
had heard of the recent performances of
the Oregon. He said he had asked with
considerable interest as to the trial trip
it it had taken j>!a?e to-day as scheduled.
He had heard ol her sixteen knots on the
way to Santa Barbara.
"Put to her be?-t, she will probably do
much better than that," ho said. "Our
ship, thu Indiana? She made something
above ti:teen knots on her trial trip. The
Oregon, however, has just been trimmed
up, had her bottom scraped and is in the
best possible condition. The Indiana was
Very foul at the time of her trial."
"But why was she allowed to make the
test in that condition?"
"Well, there was no drydock anywhere
available at the time."
"The Cramps have none about their
works?"
"No. She was slid off the stays into the
water and never came out of it again before
the test. Besides, the water of the Pacific
is much more fitvorable for speed than is
the Atlantic. I think the Indiana would
have done fully half a knot better if the
conditions had* all been right. Altogether,
the Oregon has several material advantages
over the Indiana in their respective trials."
General Williams is accomrauied by his
wife, and will go East in a day or two.
RODE THE WAVE A QUEEN
Struggle of the Big Four-Master
Achnashie With the
Billows.
Lying Low on Her Beam-Ends for Two
Day 3in a Howling Cape
Horn Gale.
Visitors along the water front cannot
fail to notice a large four-master lying at
Main-street wharf, preparing to discharge
her cargo. The vessel arrived from Liver
pool May 4 and was docked a few days ago.
She is the Achnashie (Gaelic for "held of
peace") of Glasgow, and is the prettiest
thing iv the way of ship architecture that
ever slipped into the sea. Her loni', grace
ful steel hull, painted outside a light blue,
and the steel masts and yards towering on
high have not a line that is not beautiful.
In perfect keeping with the prettiness alow
and aloft is the splendid appearance along
her decks. The inside of the bulwarks,
the bulkheads and houses are painted
white with panels of light green â a blend
ing of colors so delicate that one forgets
that this is not a pleasure yacht instead
of a common carrier of coal and general
merchandise.
The trimmings of the rails are wood,
rich and ornamental. There is as much
brass aboard ias on a man-of-war, and it
gleams with the polish of gold.
How this magnificent craft can be kept
in such a condition almost passes the
understanding, but one of the officers
stated yesterday that at sea and in port
she looks just the same. She ia com
manded by Captain Edwin Passeful, and
her officers are: First Mate John Roach,
Second Mate Alex Maxwell, and Boat
swain McGeorge. From her beautiful
figure-head of a "female form to the grace
ful center she measures 285 linear feet and
has a beam of 46 feet. She registers 2333
tons, but her carrying capacity is 4000
tons. Her rig is a four-master, the after
most or jiggcruiast being bark-rigged.
She carries three coursers, six topsails,
six top-gallant sails, three royals, besides
numberless fore and aft sails, making a
wide spread of canvas, and is manned by
twenty seamen and six apprentice boys.
During a former pnssaee to this port
while off the Horn in a gale the springing
of the vessel on the awful seas shifted the
cargo. The great ship went down on her
beam-ends and hung in that perilous posi
tion with the masts almost level with the
surface of the water. At times when the
great billows passed under her and swept
to leeward tlie royal trucks would be
drenched. With the derk almost perpen
dicular it was impossible to get fore or aft
except by crawlirrg along under the upper
rail.
The lower side was so deeply submerged
in *he sea that the crew could not get to
the lee braces, consequently the yards
could not be swung for the purpuse of
helping the ship around on the other
tack.
In a deplorable case like this, the only
expedient is to cut away the weather rig
ging and let the masts, burdened with the
weight of sail and yard, snap off and fall
to leeWard, but the captain would not sac
rifice his great steel sticks. He sent the
crew into the hold, where the cargo of
coal was lying in the under bilge. Down
in thai dark place, with the hull swaying
and springing, rising and falling on the
wild Cape Horn waves, they made tempo
rary bins with the piamung found in the
hold.
Then these strong-hearted British sailors
began the tremendous labor of shoveling
and carrying hundred? of tons of coal up
into those rude bunk^ri until the weight
brought to bear on that aide of the hull
began to lift her a little toward an even
keel.
When they could get at the "drowned"
braces and get a yard with a little rag of
sail to act to the wind they wore ship,
which brought her around so the wind
would help raise her. This brought the
deck with its incline to the runnine sea
and the waves, having broken in the
hatches, began to fill the hold. Here was
another danger, for a short time of this
would sink the ship.
Fortunately enough coal had been car
ried up into the bins to give the vessel a
slight lift in that direction, and the masts
ana yards being raised a little from the
water, the wind blowing under them was
helping her up as much as it could. A
number of barrels of cargo on the "be
tween decks" had roiled down on the
I lower bilge and by great labor were rolled
up into^lace. This helped matters along
uutl presently a harder gust than usual of
the gale lifted the masts into the air and
j the grand ship, after forty-eight hours'
i lying prostrate, arose triumphant over the
] stormy sea.
Through all those two awful days and
nights, while almost submerged, she never
I lost a spar, a sail, nor even a beiaying-pin
from the rail. She warred for weeks with

BUTCHERS BIG FIESTA.
It. Will Be Celebrated This Tear With
Peculiar Eclat.
There wae a rousing meeting of the
Butchers' Board of Traue Association last
nieht at the Alcazar building.
President Sam C. Hammond was in the
chair, supported by a representation from
all the wholesale and retail firms in this
City and Alameda County. The secretary
reported that out of 630 houses, wholesale
and retail, in the two counties, 600 firms
were represented, leaving only thirty un
affiliated, which had not as yet joined the
association.
The principal business transacted was
the coming picnic which will take place
next Wednesday at Shell Mound Park,
and in conjunction therewith the Oak
land racecourse, which is close by, has
been secured for the outdoor exercises.
Tne chairman on distribution of tickets
reported that 30,000 tickets have been dis
posed of by the various members of the
association.
This number is far in excess of any
heretofore disposed of for a similar object.
This is the third butcher's day anniver
sary held under the auspices of the Board
of Trade and it bids fair to eclipse any
thing yet given.
The services of the king of butchers,
Henry Miller of Miller & Lux, have been
secured for the office of grand marshal on
this occasion. He will be ably assisted by
Henry Moffatt, whom he selected as his
chief of staff, with the following aids:
James Hail, Samuel Soloman, A. H.
Brod, T. F. Judge, George Katz, Mark
Strouse, James Schrader, T. 0. Winters,
H.C. Faglollet, George Taffe, Fred Becker,
John S. Ott, Fred Meyer, A. P. Clayburg,
George Moffat, Chanes Robinson, E. P.
Clayburg, J. Moocky and Sam Meyer.
H. C. Faglollet will act as floor director,
assisted by R. Haas. The managers for the
outdoor sports and other members of
necessary committees will be named by
the executive committee before Wednes
day.
The public are notified that on that day
all the butcher shops in this City and
Alameda will be closed.

PORTER BROTHERS QUIT
The Dried-Fruit Dealers Assign
Everything for Their
Creditors.
Unable to Meet a First Payment on
Liabilities â Twenty Years
in the Business.
Porter Brothers, the well-known dried
fruit dealers, who failed in January and
were if en granted an extension of time by
their creditors, have given up the struggle,
and have put all their property in charge
of Wilson & Biddell, as trustees, to liquid
ate for the benefit of those to whom the
firm was indebted.
When the extension was asked for and
granted on the Ist of January it was ex
pected ti;at from the condition of business
it would be possible to pay all the liabili
ties, amounting to about $120,000, in the
time given, an arrangement having been
made for payments in six, twelve, eighteen
and twenty-four months, but subsequent
depression in Eastern prices affecting Por
ters Brothers alone to the extent of be
tween $25,000 and $30,000 in the value of
their stock made it impossible for them to
meet the first payment. So on May 7 they
notified the original trustees and decided
upon their present course.
They turned over their books and all the
property they possessed, their farms,
orchards, crops and the stock in trade,
consisting of dried fruits, nuts, honey and
beans.
"If the orchard property turns out rs
well as we expect." said D. H. Porter last
night, "everything we owe will be paid
dollar for dollar. It is impossible, by rea
son of the present condition of affairs, to
ascertain just what the liabilities or the
assets now amount to.
"Our failure was not due primarily to
the dried-fruit business, although prices
have been very low for the last two years.
It was caused mainly by our investing
$100,000 in ranch lands."
Porter Bros, have been in the fruit
business for the last twenty years, eight
years in Oakland, and the remainder of the
time in this City, their salesrooms being
313-315 Davis street.

Nuptials of Walter Scott Hobart
and Miss Hannah Wil
liams.
RARE BEAUTY OF THE BEIDE.
A Wedding Breakfast for the Most
Intimate Friendsâ Elegant Wed
ding Presents
Walter Scott Hobart and Miss Hannah
Iseil Williams were married yesterday at
noon at the Neil cottage, San Rafael,
Bishop Nichols, assisted by the Rev. Mr.
Hartmau of St. Paul's Episcopal Church,
fcian Rafael, officiating.
For the past two months society, and in
fact the community at large, has found
the nuptials of this happy young couple a
fruitful and interesting source of conversa
tion.
At firtt Dame Rumor promised a quiet
church wedding at the little church at
Ban Rafael, where for the past six years
the fair young bride has been a constant
worshiper.
Then when it was officially announced
that the wedding was to be quietly cele
brated in the Neil cottage at Sar Rafael
gossip cams to the rescue of the disap-
pointed friends and predicted a large post- 1
nuptial reception at the Hobart mansion
011 Van N'eÂ«s avenue.
Unfortunate! j', tnis was not to be so.
Arrangements for the wedding were all
conducted on the simplest and quietest
p ans in deference to the bride's mother,
who has been an invalid for the past eix
tf-i n years and to whom the slightest ex
citement might mean serious if not fatal
consequences.
There has always been an indescribable
charm about a May wedding, and yester
day's ceremony was no exception. All
nature seemed to smile approvingly. The
sun shone clear and bright. The slight
breeze just served to temper the burning
rays and make the tall pine trees that line
on either side the avenue that leads to the
rose-covered cottage sway Blightly, as
though in courteous welcome to the wed
ding guests.
The large garden that surrounds the
cottage in which roses grow and bloom in
wild and artistic confusion added to the
general picturesqueness of tbe scene and
lent that necessary touch of the ideal that
is essential to a May wedding.
The beauty without hardly prepared the
guests for the beauty within. The Neil
cottage is a home that lends itself readily
to the art of the decorator. The rooms are
large and furnished in that old-fashioned
way that is ever beautiful and artistic.
Bare pieces of antique furniture and valu
able pieces of old china add to the general
beauty of the interior and serve to tell the
story of the ancient and noble lineage of
the Neil and Williams family.
As far as was consistent, pink was made
the predominating tone of the decorations.
In the family sitling-room, where the cere
mony was performed, this color scheme
was carried out with the happiest effects.
The bay-window was the decorator's ob
jective point. The four large wiudows
which formed tbe large embrasure were
hid behind a display of fishnet, studded
with pink locust blossoms. The net was
carried forward to the ceiling, forming
overhead a triangular floral canopy. On
either side of the window were banks of
pink hydrangeas. It was in this floral em
brasure, kneeling on white satin cushions,
that the happy young couple were made
man aiid wife.
For the other apartments, on the same
floor, which were all placed at the disposal
ol the guests, no set form of decoration
was adhered to. There were simply flow
ers everywhere. Here an enormous bunch
of choice roses nodded in a costly vase
and there perhaps long, heavily laden
branches of hawthorn filled a crystal
bowl, or else wild brakes formed a cool
and pretty background for a rare bit of
bric-a-brac.
On the walls hung the family pictures,
giving to the entire scene a feeling of
home security.
To the minute, as the town bell chimed
the noon hour, the bridal party entered
the room where the ceremony was to be
performed.
The strains of Mendelssohn's wedding
march mingled strangely with tbe shouts of
boys, from Tarnalpais Col lege, just across
the road. The ceremony was simple and
impressive. First came the maids of
honor, Miss Ella Hobart and Miss Juliet
Williams. Immediately following the:n
came the bride, pale and beautiful, lean
inp on the arm of her grandfather, Robert
K. Neil. The groom, attended by his best
man, Harry Stetson, stood at tbe Bishop s
elbow waiting his bride.
The bride's mother, reclining on a divan
to the left of the floral bower, witnessed
tbe ceremony.
After the final words were pronounced
the friends of the happy young couple
crowded round them and offered their
conerntulations.
At 12:30 o'clock Mr. and Mrs. Hobart
led the way to the dining-hall, where the
bridal breakfast was served. The guests
were seated at two tables. At the bride's
table the decorations were most beautiful.
Duchesse roses arranged in large baskets
were used with most pleasing results. A
basket occupied the place 0/ honor in the
center and at the lower end. Bows and
streamers of pink ribbons, the s>ame here
as the roses, tilled in the intermediate
space. At the upper end, in front of the
covers laid for tbe bride and groom, orange
blossoms formed a pleasing decoration.
Tbe immense bridecake occupied tbe place
of honor, and had a twig of orange blos
soms stuck proudly in the top.
The menu of the breakfast was as fol
lows:
Grape food
Oyster, patties
itomiD salad
Squabs on toast
Green peas
i Icecream
Cake, -
Strawberries
Coffee, tea and chocolate
Champagne was served with all the
courses. '
Mr. and Mrs. Walter Hobart, of course,
occupied the places at the head of the
table, and Mr. and Mrs. Lester at the foot.
Seated at the right hand of the groom was
Miss Juliet Williams and at the bride's
right sat Dr. Tevis. The other guests at
the bride's' table were Miss Ella Hobart,
Wilberforce Williams, Miss Jessie Hobart.
Dennison Forsyth, Miss Allen, Mr. Me-
Near, Mrs. Lester, Mr. Lester, Miss Mary
Eyre, General Forsyth, Miss. Alice Hoff
man, Mr. Taylor, Miss Bertha Smith, Mr.
Stetson and Miss Juliet Williams. .
At the other table, were seated Robert
E. Neil, Miss Findley, Rev. Mr. Hartman,
Mrs. Neil, Bishop Nichols and Miss Vas
sault.
â  After the wedding breakfast the bride
went upstairs to don her traveling gown,
while the guests listened to the music and
inspected the wedding gifts. They were
displayed in the room to the rear of the
drawing-room -and were elegant and
costly.
In the midst of all the splendor of silver
and jewels, the groom's gifts to his bride
were prominently displayed. They were
! a tiny watch that a 5-cent piece might
i safely cover. It was an open-face time
piece, and the rim as well as the back was
a solid mass of diamonds. It was a chate
laine watch and the pin that it was at
tached to was a diamond crown. His
other gift was a jeweled polo-player that
may be worn as a ban pie or a charm. The
man and animal were of diamonds. The
rider's coat was of emeralds and his eyes

The gowns of the bridal party have here
tofore been described at length. The
bride's gown was a magnificent creation of
white satin, the corsage elaborately trim
med with tulle and duchesse lace.
The maids of honor were attired alike in
pink ailk with overdressess or white swiss
j with insertions of Valenciennes.
The bride's mother and grandmother

â¢ duchesse lace trimming the corsage.

i hat to match.

ELUDED PURSUIT.
The Happy Couple's Romantic Flight
to San Mateo In Special Train,
Tugboat and Buggy.
When young Walter Hobart planned his
wedding journey he made the most care
ful preparations, in order to avoid re
porters and the gaze of an interested
public.
The secret of his intended course was bo
well guarded that he was almost suc
cessful.
As the newly married couple were driven
to the San Rafael station soon after the
ceremony their purpose seemed evident,
but there the first disappointment awaited
the expectant passengers, who learned
after the train had started that the bride
and groom were not aboard.
On a side-irnck there had been another
locomotive with a single coach atttached.
and its destination proved to be the pier
at San Qnentin where the tugboat vigi
lant had been waiting for two hours to
carry the two passengers to San Fran
cisco.
Without baggage or even a cane or nara
sol and unhampered by friends, the happy
pair, oblivious to all else in the tirst
mom ents of their married life, started at
once from their special car tor the boat. A
small plank was laid from the rail to the
pier, and tbe groom ventured upon it. He
slipped and nearly fell overboard, but soon
after was safely on deck with his pretty
wife.
They took their positions on tbe leeward
side of the cabin, where blissfully con
scious that they were alone, they sat very
close together on two small camp stools,
the eroom's arm lovingly about his bride.
And this position they maintained during
the trip to this City.
The captain had instructed the engineers
to observe extreme caution, as the two
passengers aboard represented a little
matter of about $8,000,000. But that only
increased their desire to leave the engine
room one by one to get a glimpse of the
valuable lives in their charge.
At 2:40 o'clock the Vigilant arrived
safely at the Folsom-street pier, where a
horse and buggy stood in waiting, as a
part of the general plan. No one was in
attendance. Hobart himself unhitched
the horse, assisted his bride to the seat,
got in and drove off in the direction of Ban
Mateo, near which place he owns a coun
try residence, surrounded by extensive
grounds.
The bride wan attired very simply in a
becoming serge skirt, shirt-waist and black
straw sailor hat. The groom wore a plain
black sack suit and low-cut patent leather

GRUNT'S PEDESTAL
CUT BY FELONS
Granite Base of the Monu
ment Carved by Con
victs at Folsom.
DENIAL AND ADMISSION
C. O'Connor Avers That the
Granite Was Quarried in
Placer County.
WARDEN AULL'S STATEMENT.
He Asserts That the Stone Was Quar
ried at Folsom and Dressed by
the Convicts of the Prison.
The story whispered low yesterday turns
out to be true, and more's the pity, that
the local managers of the Grant monu
ment have had the granite pedestal for the
bronze to be placed in Golden Gate Park
quarried and aressed by convicts of Fol
som Prison.
The first intimation that such might be
the fact came through the Granite-cutters'
Union of San Francisco, and at once an
investigation was directed by The Call.
The granite-cutters have already taken
steps to notify Colonel Fred Grant of New
York and U. S. Grant Jr. of San Diego
that prison work has been employed 6n
the monument.
Last evening Cornelius O'Connor, one
of the managers of the monument asso
ciation, was asked where the granite ped
estal came from, and he replied, "from
Placer County."
"Did it not come from Folsom?" he was
asked, and in reply ne said: "It came
from a quarry in Placer County and never
was at Folsom."
In reply to the next question, "Was the
stone dressed by convicts?" Mr. O'Connor
said: "It makes no difference who dressed
the stone. Pay no attention to that."
The Call at once established communi
cation with Warden Auli at Folsom Prison.
The Warden was asked:
"Was the granite pedestal for the Grant
monument dressed at Folsom?"
He replied : "Yes, it was."
"Was it dressed by prison convicts?"
"It was," responded the Warden.
"Where did the stone come from?"
"From the Folsom quarry," replied the
Warden.
"Are you sure that it did not come from
Placer County?"
"It came from the Folsom quarry."
"Was the stone quarried by convicts?"
"It was quarried by prison labor," re
sponded the Warden.
"Where is the pedestal now?"
"In Golden Gate Park."
The Granite-cutters' Journal, published
at Baltimore, relates an incident connected
with the finishing of the celebrated Grant
monument in Riverside Park, New York.
Recently a committee calleJ Colonel Fred
Grant's attention to a rumor that the orna
mental work for the interior was to be
performed by non-xmion men and he
promptly replied: "That will not do; my
father was a union man and his tomb
should be finished by union men or left
unornamented."
There should be enough money in the
Grant monument fund of Ban Francisco to
pay for first-class free labor on the monu
ment work.
A vast deal of money was subscribed
and never paid in, yet a considerable sum
was collected and accounted for. The in
terest on the amount which was deposited
in the Anglo-Californian Bank more thaD
ten yean ago should now oc available.
Surely the contributors to the Grant
monument fund never for a moment enter
tained the thought that convict labor
would be used in handling the material for
the monument. There is not a great deal
of money circulating about the Grand
Army posts ;of California or jingling in
the pockets of Union veterans, yet there is
enough to relieve the monument man
agers of the necessity of using convict
labor in this memorial enterprise.
DISINFECTED BY FLAMES.
Residence of Dr. Zeyn Burned by
Health Officers In Alameda.
ALAMEDA, Cai., May 12.â resi
dence of the late Dr. G. C. Zeyn, together
with all his personal effects, was destroyed
by fire this morning at the instance of the
Board of Health.
This was done to prevent any dancer
from contagion from erysipelas, the
malady to which the doctor succumbed.
His surgical instruments and office
furniture were divided among the medical
brethren who attended him, in conformity
â¢with his will.
Fire Exits In Public Halls.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 12.â Mention
was made April 19 in The Call of the
want of proper fire exits to both Armory
Hall and Opera-house. The matter received
attention on May 4 at the City Trustees'
meeting. Last night the fire committee
banded in the following report on the
various hails in the city :
Fraternal Hall, Park street and Webb avenue.
The floor of the lodgeroom iv the front and
the dancing or banquet room in the rear is
very shaky. Wooden posts are set under both
of the above ball floor joists, but apparently
the foundations of the building have settled.
The danceroom door and the main door at the
foot of the stairway should be changed so as
to swing outward.
Armory Haltâ The gallery shakes badly, as
also does the main floor of the auditorium.
The street door at foot of gallery side entrance
is blocked, and door opening frcm the stage to
street stairway swings inward. The steps
leading from auditorium to stage are rotten,
as also are the three flights leading from tho
main hall exits on the Huena Vista avenue
side. The mudsills under the building are
rotten, and the herringbone bracing of the
floor joists beneath the main floor have nearly
all pulled loose in the center course. The
front main street door swings inward. As
nearly as wo could judge, the rods running
down the trusses under the roof to hold up the
gallery need tightening up, and the gallery
should also be supported from below. The
hall generally is in a bad state and in need of
repairs.
Linaerman Opera-houseâ are three
exits from the main floor to the street at front,
rear and side; all the doors opening; on these
exits swing outward. The railing on the Park
avenue stairway is too low. The exits from
the gallery deliver the people from that part
of the house at the head ol the main stairway
opposite the principal entrance to the- hall,
which is liable to cause congestion in case of
ranic. The gallery is carried by six %
and two one inch iron rods depending from
trusses under the roof and is supported from
beneath by two iron columns, two and one
fourth inches, rising from 'he main floor joists,
and wooden brackets under the sides. These
brackets were originally made to carry twice
the weight put upon them.
Although this gallery trembled somewhat
when a man jumped up and down there are no
evidences of weakness either in the trusses
under the roof, the plastering under the gal
lery or on the main walls. At our suggestion
Mr. Linaerman agreed to put in three addi
tional joists under the raise of the gallery floor
to stiffen it. The floor joists of the second
story are 2xlÃ and the studding sills rest on
solid concrete walls.
The defects in the other halls consisted
principally in the doors swinging inward.
It was resolved that the City Attorney be
instructed to araw up au "ordinance to
remedy the defects spoken of and to pre
vent the aisles and passageways being
blocked during performances.

THE BABY BOY BROWNING
Preliminary Examination of John
T. Flynn Resumed
Yesterday.
Mrs. Shaen, Mrs. Brownng's Sister,
tJndergoes a Severe Cross*
Examination.
The preliminary examination of John
T. Flynn, charged with the murder of
baby boy Browning, was resumed before
Judge Low yesterday afternoon.
Mrs. Browning, the mother, was put on
the stand for further cross-examination.
She admitted that Edward T. Dellex, a
hack-driver, lived with her at 1135 Mission
street, but oenied that the/ were known
as man and wife. She was never asked
the question by the landlady. They lived
there last year. Dellex had called upon
her two days before the baby wa9 born.
Mrs. Shaen, Mrs. Browning's sister, was
put through a severe cross-examination by
George A. Knight. She said she was a
married woman, but could not tell the
month or year when she was married to
her present husband, or who performed
tbe ceremony.
She had been previously married to a
saloon-keeper naned Kimball In Santa
Monica, who was shot and killed, but she
refused to say whether it was accidentally
or not. She denied ever living in Los An
geles or that she kept a house of ill
fame there. She was not known there as
Miss May Enright. Subsequently she ad
mitted that after Kimball was shot she
went to Los Angeles and lived with her
sister-in-law for tivs months.
She was introduced to a Mr. Jones by
her sister about two months ago and since
then her sister had told her that the man's
real name was Flynn. She had not seen
him since. Fiynn was made to stand up
and she said she would not swear he was
tbe man introduced to her as Mr. Jones.
I She denied that Flynn went for her the
night the baby was born and said it was
her nephew. She did not look at the baby
after she placed it in the bureau-drawer.
When she and her niece went to her home
to get the hot-water bag Mrs. Browning was
alone, and when they returned the baby was
gone.
Tessie Browning, Mrs. Browning's
daughter, testified that Dellex, the hack
driver, boarded with her mother on Mission
street. She knew Flynn, and was intro
duced to him by her mother. Flynn was
a frequent visitor at the house. Or cross
examination 9he said she knew nothing
about the birth of the baby, and simply
asked her aunt while going' for the hot
water bag if her mother was better. When
they returned, the door was locked, and
she had to open it with her key.
Dr. Barrett, who made the autopsy, said
the baby died from inanition. Detectives
Gibson and Wren gave unimportant tes
timony, and the case for the prosecution
was closed.
Flynn in his testimony flatly contra
dicted Mrs. Browning, Mrs. Shaen and
Tessie Browning in many essential partic
ulars. On the night the baby was born he
was at Mrs. Browning's place three times.
The first time about 8:30 o'clock, when he
found Mrs. Browning in bed. Then at
10:30, when Mrs. Shaen told him to
call back in an hour. He did so, and after
waiting with Tessie in the front room for
about three-quarters of an hour he, at the
request of Mrs. Sbaen, took Tessie out fora
walk. They returned about 1:30 a. m., and
I he went home with Mrs. Shaen for the hot
| water bag, carrying at her request a bundle,
which she said contained soiled clothes.
"When they got to Mrs. Shaen's house she
invited him in and he had a glass of
whisky with her. He returned to Mrs.
Browning's with Mrs. Shaen, and after
waiting for about five minutes went home
to the Winchester House. He admitted
giving Mrs. Browning money, but it was
out 01 pure friendship and to help her and
her two children.
Tbe examination will be resumed to
morrow afternoon.

REBEKAHS' CONVENTION
Grand Lodge's Forty-Fourth An
nual Sessionâ Sixth of
Rebekahs.
MRS. DONOHO FOB v THE CALL"
Gilroy Town Wants the Orphans'
Home, Now Situated in
Thermalito.
Yesterday was Odd Fellows' day.
The ribbon-bedecked member of the
order was in evidence everywhere â on the
streets, in the hotel corridors, in the cable
cars and round the various places of
amusement. His presence was manifestly
felt.
The wearing of badges was in no wise
monopolized by men ; the ladies with
their gay decorations seemed as numerous
as the sands of the sea, and their beatific
Bmiles conclusively demonstrated that,
though their sojourn was for the transac
tion of business, the amount of pleasure
they were deriving from it was not closely
hedged about with limitations.
And the cause of all this excitement and
bustle was the meeting of the State bodies
of both organizations, the O<ld Fellows
and the Daughters of Rebekah. In fra
ternal parlance the State body of the
former is called the Grand Lodge of the
1. 0. O. F. of California, and the latter the
State Assembly of the Daughters of Re
bekah.
This annual session of the Grand Lodge
marks the forty-fourth milestone of its
progress. The Kebekahs are younger â this
being their sixth annual communication â
which would seem eminently proper, as
the sister organization is supposed to De
under the protecting wing of tbe older and
sterner body.
At 9 o'clock the Grand Lodge convened
in assembly hall of Odd Fellows' building,
corner of Market and Seventh streets.
About 600 delegates were to be present,
and most of them were. None of the
officers were absent, and a full quorum was
ready to take up business.
The meeting was formally called to or
der by Grand Master P/F. Gosbey, and
everything was got in ordÂ«r for embarking
upon the sea of technicalities incident to
such a gathering, after which a short re
cess was taken.
During the recess everything waa con
fusion. Congratulations and handshaking
were witnessed in every part of the large
hall. Many of the delegates have acted in
this capacity before and thereby became
acquainted with many of their* brethren
from other lodges, and they all beamed
with friendliness and satisfaction at meet
ing again in the same spot hallowed by
past associations.
Many of tbe delegates from the interior
had aruved Monday, and several of the
officers and prominent lay members were
entertained at dinner the same evening by
ex-Justice of the Supreme Court C. N.
Fox at his home in Oakland.
After recess the committee on creden
tials rendered its report.
The next item was to confer the Grand
Ledge degree on 275 members.
Then the grand master rendered his re
port. The document waa of great length
and dealt with all the subordinate lodges,
new lodges of both the Odd Fellows and
the Rebekahs, dispensations granted and
refused, and handed down many de
cisions. Tne report lead off as follow?:
â¢Through the providential care of our
Supreme Grand Waster we have been per
nmted again to assemble in deliberative
body to learn of the good done, results
accomplished and blessings given and re
ceived by our beloved order during the
year last passed.
"The results of my stewardship will
soon become known to you. L am aware
that everything which has been done and
said by me will not meet with universal
approval, yet I expect from you your
kindest brotherly indulgence and consid
eration."
Ihe body of the report showed that two I
subordinate lodges have been instituted â 
during the past year, Farnsworth Lodge \
No. 95 at San Francisco, with twenrv-tive '
charter members, and Bridgeport Lodge 1
No. 386 at Bridgeport, Mono County, with
twelve charter members. In addition
twelve Rebekah lodges were instituted.
Six lodges were duly consolidated with I
three, this course being desired by the
lodges themselves. The number of dis- j
pensations granted was 215; refused 2.
There followed a long list of decisions,
visitations and recommendations. None
of the decisions make any startling de
parture from the laws laid down by prece- I
dent, and it is believed by members that
they will pass unquestioned.
Followine the rule of rotation in office, a |
long-established custom, the grand master ;
took occasion to refer to the one who will i
in all likelihood be his successor to the im
portant office of the headship of the i
1. O. O. F. in this State. He said:
"My successor. Brother J. W. Warboys,
is well qualified to take up the work where I
it has been left off. 1 ask for him the
same kind consideration and support
which I have received, and our beloved
order will move on in its great work of I
brotherly love and kindness, fulfill its
great mission of fraternizing the world,
ever looking to the supreme grand master
of t..e universe for his guidance and direc
tion in our great work of humanity."
The report was referred to tbe commit- \
tee on distribution.
The reports of the other grand officers j
wtre then given in succession. At 12 m.
an adjournment was taken till 2 v. m.
The grand secretary's report, the first of
the afternoon session, showed that the as
sets of the order had increased during the
year by $52,000, though there was a de
crease of rifty-six in membership. Out of
the relief fund tha sum of $278,0C0 had
been paid.
The grand treasurer's report showed
that the balance on hand is $15,52158;
$42,609 20 has been received during the
year, and $46,648 55 paid out. The balance
at the time the forty-third annual report
was made amounted to $19,500 93. All the
reports were referred to tbe proper com
mittees.
Next in line of business was the reports
of the various committees. The only time
for this during the afternoon was taken up
by the committee on appeals. They were
accepted to the unit.
To-morrow other reports will be handed
i:i and all will be duly considered, as well
as tbe decisions rendered by the grand
Master, which were referred to the com
nittee on legislation.
Among other matters touched upon
Ightly during tie day was tbe home at
1 hermalito, which is in a temporary loca
tion and hÂ»s been in existence for only a
year. It was learned that the results
a hieved by the home during the year
were very encouraging.
The hours of meeting were fixed from 10
to 12 in the forenoon, from 2 to 5 in the
afternoon and in the evenings as ordered.
There was no evening session, owing to
a banquet given the "veterans" in the
order at the St. Nicholas Hotel, which had
been tastefully decorated for the occasion.
Speeches were made by the prominent
members, in which they congratulated one
another and the order generally on its
nourishing condition.
To-day the member* say they intend to
get down to good solid work after yester
day's preliminary skirmishing.
REBEKAHS IN SESSION.
Public Reception to the Visiting
Delegates In the
Evening.
At the same time the Grand Lodge con
vened in the morning the grand president
of the Rebekahs. Miss Fannie Benjamin of
Los Angeles, in Memorial Hall, Odd Fel
lows' building, called the ladies.
The morning session was mostly de
voted to reading grand officers' reports.
In general they showed that the condition
of the order was prosperous and promised j
to ascend to Higher planes of usefulness.
The grand president's report was orna
mented with gems of rhetoric, which glit
tered and sparkled pleasantly amid their
more prosaic setting.
"Met again ! How the life-ripples dance !"
the report began. "How the eye-glances
dart, and how the hand-graspa quiver with
the delirium of joy at this, our glad re
union!
"Met again, old friends and new friends,
yet all united in the golden bond of Friend
ship, Love and Truth."
The reading of tue report was frequently
interrupted by the applause of ite admir
ing members and delegates.
The afternoon session was opened with
addresses by Grand Master Gosbey of San
Jose and Deputy Grand Master G. M. War
boys of Santa Koa.
The assembly degree was conferred by
Past Grand Representative Thompson of
Eureka, wno is an honorary member of
the State Assembly.
The various reports were referred to the
proper committees.
An invitation was sent to the Grand
Lodge to attend their reception in Assem
bly Hall during tne evening.
The last subject of the afternoon, which
attracted v deal of interest, was the read
ing of a letter sent to the grand secretary
of the State Assembly by a Mrs. Hoxett of
Gilroy. The letter was with regard to the
Orphans' Home at Thermalito.
The writer stated that a Mr. Miller of
Gilroy had promised as an inducement to
moving the home to that city that he
would denote five acres of land for a site,
worth $1500.
The letter further made known that the
city itself had given ita word to furnish i
water free, and anything else it could |
legally.
besides this, the citizens bad stated that I
they would contribute the sum of $1050,
and four ladies would eacn Inrnish a room
at a cost not to exceed $50, a doctor's ser
vices for two years, a norse, a cow and
chickens, and 100 choice trees, together
with fifty rose bushes of different vari
eties.
The letter was spread upon the minutes '
and will be considered during the session. 1
At the close Mrs. Donoho, the grand I
secretary, made a short speech, highly 'â 
eulogizing Ths Call.
Said the lady: "The Call is distinc
tively a woman s paper.
"It is not afraid to come out on the side
of right and justice, and extend the help
ing hand to the women in their struggle
for recognition. All honor to it, I say, for
its sturdy nobility of management.
"It is our duty to aid it by patronizing j
it, for it is not meet tnat we should ignobly j
forget tnose that have befriended us. May
Tin: Call's manager have a long and suc
cessful career is my desire."
In the evening Fair Oaks Rebekah Lodge
conferred the Rebekah degree in Assembly
Hall. Afterward there was a public recep- â 
tion for the visiting delegates and their
families. A most pleasant time was had,
and the ladies said they were ready to
attack the work that lay before them with â¢
renewed vigor.
A BEST FOR MISS ASHLEY
She Broke Down on the Stand
Yesterday, so Court
Adjourned.
j Scope of the Testimony as Taken Yes
terday Behind the Closed
Doors.
For all yesterday morning Judge Slack's
' courtroom doore were inhospitably closed
i to intruders ; but it was only for the morn-
I ing, for at noon the case closed for the
day.
Miss Ashley was still upon tbe stand
when the court adjourned, but her direct
i testimony is nearly all in, and her cross
: examination will ttart to-day. Sbe took
! up the thread of her evidence where she
i laid it down yesterday â where she told
j how she started back home with her child.
Previous to its birth, she said, she had
| hunt ed for Baldwin all over, trying to get
i him to care for her and give her aesist
; ance. She finally met him in St. Louis â
at the racetrack thereâ and he gave her
$40, but that sum was all he ever gave her.
I He left St. Louis soon after her arrival,
and she still hunted for him; but finally
I she gave up her search and came back to
| Los Angeles. There her child was born.
The witness was acain questioned as to
| her relations with Baldwin, and as to tne
tune and circumstances under which she
told her brother of what had taken place
between herself and Baldwin. Her letters
and telegrams were read to her â the ones
sne wrote and sent to Baldwin before sbe
started for California, while sue was on the
way here and after she got into trouble.
Her early life was gone into, and all about
her habits and her character was drawn
out by Crittenden's questions.
Toward the close of the morning session
the witness broke down completely ; the
brutal frankness of the questions which
had to be asked overcame her, and sbe
sobbed violently on the stand while the
counsel waited J .o proceed. When the
court adjourned at noon it was decided
not to continue during tbe afternoon out
of deference to the unstrung nerves of the
witness, and a recess until this morning
was taken.
Counsel for the defendant make few ob
jections. They protest now and then that
a question is leading or irrelevant, but
they allow the same lin- of questions as
were put on the examinations for deposi
tions to be put before the court.

from a four-furlong scramble for members
of the two-year-old division to a one and a
sixteenth miles ran for all ages. Outside
of the defeat of four first choices the day's
sport passed off without incident worthy
of more than passing notice.
In the saddle H. Martin had quite a
profitable day of it, landing two of the
winners past the wire and finishing in sec
ond place on the back of oid Jack Riche
lieu in the distance race.
In the last race, a spin at six furlongs,
Si McClain put up a ride on the even
money choice. Babe Murphy, that im
pressed the judges as being a very peculiar
one and he stands indefinitely suspended.
Against the company opposed to her the
mare looked almost a certainty on her last
run, when she finished a close third to
George Miller and Bueno in a six-furlong
sprint, decided on Friday of last week.
On that occasion she came with a fine
showing of speed at the end and looked
tbe best horse in the race at the finish.
However the educated coin was withheld
yesterday. At the start Si was away well
with the favorite, but before a sixteenth
of the distance bad been covered was last.
He then took his mount on the outside
making the overland trip, and as the
stretch was reached it looked as though
the mare still had a chance, but tne effort
had proven too mucn and sbe ran un
placed. The result of the race was a sur
prise. After Kowalsity had outfooted
Morven and looked to be winning easily
Sea Spray came like a meteor from the
heavens and nipped the race at the wire
by the scantiest of heads. Tne winner
was a 10 to 1 shot in the batting.
The opening scramble for two-year-olds
did not augur well for the favorite. The
El Primero stable's Lodestar was consid
ered a "moral," going to the post heavily
played at the short price of 7to 10. In a
iliive he "was beaten out a head by Scar
borough, the "horse of mystery," second
choice in the betting, who covered the four
furlongs in 50 seconds fat, over a track
that was not fast.
The friends of the brown gelding Per
haps made a big plunge on him to pull off
the second event at six furlongs, backing
him steadily at odds of 7to 5. He raised
their expectations high by showing the
way until well into the stretch, when he
began to falter and ran unplaced. Peru,
the 4 to 1 second choice, came on from the
rear and won easily, three lengths in front
of Inna.
W. L. Stanfield's consistent performer,
George Miller, again gained brackets in
the live and a naif forionc sprint that fol
lowed. He waa backed from Bto 5 down
to 6 to 5, and leading almost from the start
beat William Pinkerton out a length and
a half at the wire. Imp. Santa Bella was
third.
The best the 2% to 1 favorite, Perseus,
could do in the mile and a sixteenth run
with nine starters was to finish third. The
second choice, Belle Boyd, took the lead
after passing the stand and was not after
headed, leading the 20 to 1 chance. Jack
Kichelien, out at the finishing post by a
length. Perseus was a poor third.
A seven-furlong tour furnisned another
opportunity for E. Corrigan'B fine mare,
Olive, to annex a purse. Going to the post
a 3 to 2 choice, she had shaken Miss Brum
mel off by the time the stretch was reached,
and ridden out disposed of the poorly rid
den Chartreuse II by half a length.
TBACK AND PADDOCK ITEMS.
Thousands of ladies are expected to
honor Ingleside to-day with their presence.
It is "laities day"' as well as the closing
day of the two weeks' meeting and the man
agement has set forth especial pains in the
preparation of a grand programme. Prim
rose & West's big minstrel company will
attend in a body, and it promises to be a
gala occasion.
Jockey Macklin leaves for New Orleans
this evening. After staying tnere for a
few days at his home he will proceed north
to ride the crack Libertine in nis stake
engagements.
The popular owner and trainer, Mat
Storn, came very near springing a sur
prise in the opening race. Bohemian Lass,
a filly, by Flambeau, in Mai's string, was
allowed to run loose at odds of 150 to 1,
and startled the crowd by leading until a
sixteenth from the wire, where she tired,
but finished a good third. Show odds of
20 to 1 were laid against her.
If Chief Crowley will delegate an officer
he will find that tne poolrooms are again
operating in open defiance of the law,
under the old guise of doing a commission
business. Odds are laid in some instances
reilinulonsly higher tnan laid at the track,
with an object no doubt of keeping players
dpwntown. Results are also given at the
conclusion of each race.
On Hay 8 George Miller won a race at
Ingleside, starting at odds of 6 to 5, while
in one downtown room 2 to 1 was posted
against him. This shows conclusively
that the gamblers are at their old game,
and as it is an open violation of the decis
ion handed down by Judge Wallace there
is no excuse for them being allowed to re
main open. The police have never put
forth very strenuous efforts to effectually
close these dens.
Captain James H. Rees, who has offi
ciated in the judges' stand as presiding
judge since the opening of the inaugural
meeting at Ingleside track, will leave for
Cincinnati to-night, where ne will till the
same position at the Oakley meeting.
On his arrival in California last Novem
ber, Captain Kecs was an enure stranger
to the major portion of the local race-eoing
public, but through his courteous and
kind treatment of all, coupled with rulings
that were as impartial as they were just,
his friends are now legion, and the genial
Southern turfman can rest assured that he
occupies a warm place in the hearts of all
admirers of clean and honest sport in this
State, and a hearty welcome will await
him on his return to California next fall.
SPORTS AND ATHLETICS.
Oakland Bench Show and the
Officers Who Will Be in ,
Charge.
Annual Meeting of the Pacific Ath
letic Association â San Francisco
Turn Verein.
The Alameda County Sportsmen's As
sociation is making extensive prepara
tions for its second annual bench show,
which will be held in the Mills Taber
nacle, Oakland, commencing on the 20th
inst. The members of the club are jubi
lant because of the large number of dogs
that have been entered.
Many of the prize-winners at the Pacific
Kennel Club's show will appear before
Judge J. Otis Fellows, whose opinion of
dogs and their quality is somewhat at
variance with Judge Mortimer's.
The officers of the club are: F. E. Mil
ler, president; Clarence Crowell, vice*

ONE PARK FOR ANOTHER
The Mission Improvement Union
Would Sell Buena Vista
Park.
A Pleasure Place Is Needed in the
Mission â Boulevard of Dolores
Street.
Encouraged by the success of what has
been undertaken by the Mission Improve
ment Club in securing a High School and
the turning into a grand boulevard the
heretofore neglected Folsom street, the
club will, if it be possible, secure a public
parK on the site of the abandoned
cemeteries.
To make this an assured success steps
will be taken when the Legislature con
venes next January to have a bill passed
which will authorize the Supervisors to
sell Buena Vista Park, bounded by Haight,
Henry, Broderick and Lott streets, which
is within a few blocks of the Golden Gate
Park.
The argument advanced by the advo
cates of this measure will be that there is
really no necessity for a public park in
that section and that tbe property should
be sold and the proceeds applied to the
purchase of tbe Mission land.
They claim that at tlie time Buena Vista
Park was laid out on the official map
Golden Gate Park was not dreamed of, but
since that time the condition of things
have changed and now it would be a waste
of public money to place the ground in
proper condition for a public resort, and
even after tbe expenditure of all this
money Buena Vista Park would not be
used or appreciated by tbe people for
whose benefit it was originally intended.
One of the strange features connected
with the early grants of land for parks was
that the official eye looked directly west
from the City Front, and the Mission, the
first location inhabited, had been com
pletely overlooked, and no provisions were
made for parks in this district.
Next in importance comes the question
of making Dolores street, a boulevard and
to this end a petition to the Supervisors
has been widely circulated for signatures
and will be presented at the next meeting
of the board.

TO TAX THE BOYS
AN X A YEAR
Regents of the University
Talk of Imposing Such
Charge.
MORE MONEY IS NEEDED
Governor Budd Says the Tax on
Berkeley Boys Will Raise
a Howl.
AFFILIATED COLLEGES SITE.
Mayor Sutro Extends the Time for
Beginning Work â The Extension
Accepted.
The Board of Regents of the State Uni
versity held an interesting session yester
day afternoon at the Mark Hopkins Insti
tute of Art. A proposition to tax each
student of the university |10 a year to keep
up the high pressure of education met
with determined resistance and was de
ferred. Mayor Sutro's extension of time
on his deed of land for the Affiliated Col
leges was considered and practically ac
cepted.
The regents attending the session were
Governor Budd (presiding), Hallidie, Mil
ler, Denicke, Martin, Houghton, Wallace,
Kellogg, Black, Reinstein, Slack, Chase,
Rodgers, Phelps and Marye. Secretary
Bonte and Attorney Mhoon also attended
the session.
Judge Wallace, in discussing the ap
proval of minutes of a previous session, ex
plained that according to the law of 1868
creating the university, and also in the
constitution of 1879, the regents were not
bound to observe laws of tlie Legislature
relative to the construction of public build
ings.
Governor Budd and Judge Wallace ex
changed views on this subject, and the
regents finally decided to refer the ques
tion to Attorney -General Fitzgerald.
On motion of President Kellogg it was
decided that cadet uniforms should be
procured in the same manner that other
articles for the university are obtained.
Professor Le Conte was granted a leave
of absence without loss of pay from
August 10, ISV6, to January 10, 1897.
Trie regents acknowledged by resolution
the receipt of valuable books for the de
partment of jurisprudence. The books
were donated by the Bancroft- Whitney
Company and several graduates of the
university.
Secretary Bonte read the report of the
finance committee. A recommendation
was contained in the report that an inci
dental tax of $10 per term should be
charged to students. The committee
could not submit the budget until that
proposition was settled.
George T. Marye, from the committee on
internal administration, presented a sup
plemental report. T;;e position is taken
that some provision for increased revenue
must be made.
Governor Budd â How much will this tax
increase the revenue?
Regent Marye â About $16,000 per an
num.
Governor Budd â Is there no way of cur
tailing expenses to save this amount? I
think the putting of a tax on students wiil
have a bad effect on the public at large.
Regent Marye proceeded with the read
ing of his supplemental report setting
forth that the tax was absolutely neces
sary, as an increase of the revenue was de
manded. Lignt was needed for the
grounds and it was necessary to keep the
library open in the evenings. There were
many incidental expenses to be met.
Salaries could not be reduced without
danger of losing the Dest men in the ser
vice of the university.
Governor Budd â It does seem to me
that a university with $300,000 a year to
expend ought to be able to get along with
out putting a $10 tax on students. It
seems a shame to levy a tax of that kind
after the public support which has been
given to the institution for so many years.
In the course of the discussion the Gov
ernor mentioned that the valuation of
State property for 1895 waa $1,133,282,980.
The indications were that the valuation
this year would be less, and that another
high tax levy would follow. It seemed to
him that tbe regents should better appeal
to the Legislature for $16,000 extra than
to levy a tax on tne students. It will
hurt us abroad and drive students to Stan
ford if we make the boys and girls at
Berkeley go down in their pockets to pay
this tax.
Judge Wallace said he would be sorry to
see a tax of any sort placed on a boy going
to the university to get something* wliich
tbe State had provided for.
General Houghton said the tax was not
excessive and did not indicate extrava
eance. Necessity compels tne regents to
raise more money than has beeen pro
vided.
Arthur Rodgers advised postponement
of the subject. He believed that the Gov
ernor's suggestion to ask the Legislature
for more money should be adopted. The
knowledge that students are numerous
would greatly influence tbe Legislature.
Regent Hallidie presented objections to
delay. He said: "Tue budget cannot be
delayed. I can see no other way out of
the difficulty than the incidental charge.
If we have 800 stuients we will get
$16,000."
Governor Buddâ lf you put the tax on
students you will raise the* biggest bowl
ever beard in California.
General Houghtonâ That's what we want
to raise. The needs of the university will
then be understood.
Governor Buddâ You will hear rrom the
San Joaquin Valley if students of the
university are taxed. The diflicuity of
getting future appropriations from the
State will be increased.
Regent Reinstein, who is strong on
special meetings and broad discussions,
wanted the whole subject of finance de
ferred for special consideration in a broad
way.
Other regents, who fancied that the dis
cussion had already acquired sufficient
breadth and length, were willing that the
matter should go to a committee on ways
and means.
Judge Wallace insisted that a commit
tee on ways and means should be ap
pointed, and when the motion prevailed
Governor Buddâ moved, perhaps, by an
impulse to reward Reinstein for modesty
made that young regent chairman of the
important committee. Regents Rodgers
and Black were named as members of the
committee.
At the conclusion of the finance com
mittee report Judge Wallace announced
that a letter from Mayor Sutro was in his
possession The closest attention was paid
to toe reading of the following document:
Ban- Franciso), May 2, 1896
To the Regents of the Stale University: In the
deed for the Affiliated College Bite executed by
me to the regents of the University of Califor
nia dated October 8, 1895, and recorded in the
Keccrder's office of the City aud County of San
Francisco on the same day. was attached the
condition that work on the colleee buildings
mnst be commenced within six months, and to
the extent of the appropriation therefor, com
pleted within five years trom the date of the
deed. That condition has not yet been com
plied with inasmuch as the work on the build
ing has not been commenced although the six
months from the date of my deed to you have
elapsed.
Thia breach in one of the conditions of the
deed results in the reversion to me ol the tiUe
to the site unless I grant an extension of time
within which you were required by the deed
to commence work.
You have requested that the time provided
in the deed for the commencement of the
work be extended six months. This extension
of six months additional to that set out in the
deed I hereby grant you.
Should you fail to' commence work within
the mx months additional, that is on or before
tne Bth^>f October, 1896, then it is understood
that tlie title to the property reverts to me.
All the other terms, conditions and covenants
of the deed heretofore made are continued in
full force as thereto made. Respectfully.
ADOLPH SUTRO.
Regent Rodgers moved that the instru
ment submitted by Mr. Sutro be accepted
and placed on record.
Governor Buddâ lt should have been
made as an acknowledged instrument.
Judge Wallace â It is a waiver in writing.
Mr. Rodgers spoke highly of Mayor
Sutro's generosity.
Regent Albert Miller appreciated Mayor
Sutro's intentions and had no Joubt they
would be carried out if the donor lived,
but in the event of Sutro's death many
complications with his heirs might ensue.
General Houghton commended Mr.
Sutro's generosity.
Governor Budd â I recognize Mayor
Sutro's donation as a very generous gift,
and ordinarily I would not look a gift
horse in the mouth. Now, gentlemen, is
not Mayor Sutro as much benefited as we
are by that gift? I went over that mag
nificent siteâ l acknowledge that it is a
superb site â with Mayor Sutro. fie was
anxious to have this State building, cost
ing $250,000, erected on this site, adjacent
to other land which he owns. It was a
matter of mutual benefit, and l should
have voted for the site independent of his
liberal offer. When the matter was about
to come before this board I was sick and
absent, yet so anxious was he for the adop
tion of the site that a tug was tendered to
bring me to San Francisco.
The" Governor referred to Mayor Sutro's
attacks on himself and other regents, in
which it was charged that the orders of
the octopus influenced the board. The
Governor suggested that all of the offers
made by Mayor Sutro should be carried
out. As Governor of the State he \vould
guarantee that the Legislature would pass
an act maintaining the Sutro library free
of taxes if the Mayor would deed it to the
State as he had promised. If Mayor Sutro
is willing to enter into any agreement
placing the Sutro library in possession of
the State or City let him place that agree
ment in our possession.
Judge Wallace said if the proposition
which the Governor made could be carried
out the last objection of Mr. Sutro would
be removed. In twenty-lour hours he
would deed the library site were he satis
fied on the subject of taxes.
Regent Phelps said he voted to accept
this land because he believed it was the
best site obtainable.
"I shall vote now to accept it. I do not
think any regent." said Mr. Hallidie,
"was influenced in the acceptance by the
offer of the library site. We have pro
ceeded unfortunately with Mr. Sutro. He
seems to have been nettled at our course.
If our attorney and law committee now as
sure us that there can be no question of
title we should accept the gift. It is a mag
nificent donation."
Judge Slack suggested some amend
ments to Mr. Rodgers' resolution accept
ing Mr. Sutro s suggestion.
Other suggestions were made and it
seemed to be the purpose of tbe board to
attach many conditions and letters to the
Sutro letter and put them all on record.
Governor Budd insisted that if the re
gents could accept a site, agreeing to put
up buildings, they could also accept land
on agreement to pay taxes.
Judge Wallace, with some animation
and lucidity, said: "This Sutro letter
does not require any acceptance or any
thing of the sort. It is a plain waiver, and
we have the title now as clear as ever. We
may embarrass ourselves oy putting in
conditions of acceptance. I^et us simply
record the facts in our minutes. That is
sufficient."
The question was then referred to Attor
ney Mhoon, and to-day perhaps the rec
ord for tho minutes will be prepared. The
letter may also be recorded.
Plans for the affiliated colleges buildings
will be sent to Sacramento at once for sub
mission to the Governor, Secretary of
State and Treasurer.
Regent Phelps, President Kellogg and
Governor Budd were authorized to prepare
a list of standing committees for the en
suing year.
Next Tuesday the Wilmerding school
site will be taken up again. The secretary
was directed to invite William Alvord,
Thomas J. Lamb, Herman Schussler and
E. A. Fargo to attend the session next
Tuesday.
FOUR MEN'S BRUTALITY.
Revolting Story of Crime Told
by Three Young
Girls.
A Colored Man Arrested and War.
rants Out for the Arrest of
Three Sailors.
A colored man known as "Black Dia
mond," who lives with a white woman on
Sherwood place, is in the tanks at the City
Prison and warrants have been issued for
the arrest of three sailors belonging to the
United States gunboat Bennington.
The crime for which the four men will
be tried bears a strong resemblance to that
involved in the North Beach scandals that
roused so much public indignation against
Captain Lane and other old men several
months ago.
Annie Doherty, 16 years of age, living at
14 Sherwood place; Katie Langshaw, 15
years of age. 23 Sherwood place, and An
nie Otis, 14 years of age, living at 63 Ship
ley street, are tbe victims of the four men.
According to the story told by the girls
to Policeman Ryan they were playing on
the sidewalk near "Black Diamond's"
bouse Sunday afternoon when he called to
them to come inside. The Langshaw girl
had done housework for him, so they had
no hesitation in going in Jo the house.
They were taken to a room upstairs where
the three sailors were drinking. The girls
were kept there for several hours and
criminally assaulted by the four men.
"Black Diamond" threatened them with
all sorts of punishment if they related
their experience. The girls told their
parents, who notified the police, and
Ryan arrested the colored man.
District Attorney Barnes was consulted
as to the proper course to pursue regard
ing the three sailors, and he communi
cated with the commandant of the navy
yard. No objection will be made to sur
rendering the three men aa soon as tney
can be identified.
The three g.rls were examined yesterday
morning at the Receiving Hospital by Dr.
Stice, and are now in the care of Matron
Giimore at the City Prison.
A few weeks ago the white woman who
lives with "Black Diamond" as his wife
attempted to commit suicide by swallow
ing poison. When discovered she had
one of his photographs clutched in her
right hand and left a letter that it should
be buried with her if she died.
The -Black Diamond's" name is F. H.
Wath. The police give bira the reputation
of being a vicious character.
Died From Ileart Disease.
James Sheeny, a street-sweeper living at 446

His death was due to heart disease. The body

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 13, 1896.
IN THE NOONDAY
OF OUR LIBERTY
Father Yorke Thinks Amer
icans Have Arrived
There.
A POWERFUL LECTURE.
The Speaker Scores Secret So
cieties as a Menace to
the Public.
MUCH ENTHUSIASM IS SHOWN.
Rabbi Levy and James H. Barry Make
Brief Addresses to the Vast
Concourse.
At 7:45 o'clock yesterday evening the
ticket office at the Metropolitan Temple
was closed. The hall was already crowded
to suffocation, and the committee on ar
rangements decided that it would be
wrong to sell tickets to people who could
make no use of them.
The ladies of the American Woman's
Liberal League were in high feather. The
Very Rev. Peter C. Yorke, Chancellor of
the archdiocese, was to deliver the last ot
his course of lectures on civil and religious
liberty, and tbe occasion gave ample ex
cuse, to their way of thinking, for the fts
tal aspect of the temple's interior.
The stage was banked with calla lilies,
which also festooned the pipes of the great
organ and garlanded the speaker's desk.
The National colors floated everywhere
and an air of enthusiastic patriotism per
vaded the vast assemblage. Rabbi M. S.
Levy of Congregation Beth Israel pre
sided.
The programme opened with the sing
ing of Pinsuti's beautiful tenor solo, "But
I Was Dreaming," given with charming
expression by J" F. O'Brien, with piano
accompaniment by M iss Mary F. Giorgiani,
organist of tbe old cathedral.
Miss Alice Condon followed in a humor
ous recitation by way of a presentation
speech to the Rev. Father Yorke, to whom
amid much applause she handed a gayly
decorated broom "to sweep the A. P. A.'s
out of tbe way with."
The next number was a romanza by
Bellenghi, whicb was admirably rendered
by Mme. Angelini Casati.
The Rev. Dr. Levy made a very brief ad
dress, in the course of which he alluded to
the unique spectacle of Rabbi and Cath
olic priest side oy side in a public hall. In
burning words he called upon all patriotic
Americans to do their bust to break down
any barriers which ignorance, bigotry and
prejudice may have raised between Ameri
can citizens.
He said he could see no reason for a
broom being presented to Father Yorke.
since that gentleman bad made so clean a
sweep of his adversaries already without
the aid of a broom.
"I am very sorry to differ with the good
rabbi," said Father Yorke, when he had
been introduced; "but when it comes to a
'clean sweep' I have to take an exception.
Not all the brooms on earth could sweep
some of our adversaries clean.
"But another thing ought to be men
tioned. The first clerical condemnation of
the A. P. A. in this City came from the
Jewish pulpits. How fitting it is, then,
that a rabbi should meet with us here to
night!''
Father Yorke then commenced his lec
ture. After reviewing the ground covered
by the first four lectures of the course he
spoke in part as follows:
"We have seen tue glimmerings of the
dawn, the entrance of the light and the
beginning of tbe day of liberty, and now
we stand in the full, glorious noontide of
freedom. Those of us who are Cat Holies
imagine that we have a right to enjoy this
state of affairs. We further claim the" right
to stand on a level with all our fellow-citi
zens, asking for no favors, and also asking
that no unjust discrimination beexercised
against us. But this is just what certain
self-styled patriots object to. They would
have us thrust down and away, as though
we were something unmentionably vile.
"We hear it said that the American
Catholics are all right, but that there aro
Catholics and Catholics. The Pope, the
Ultramontane, the Jesuit â particularly
the disguised Jesuit â and above all the
dreadful hierarchy, unite to form a bogie
man so horrible as to strike terror to the
stoutest neart.
"What, now, is the attitude of Catholic
theology and philosophy regarding those
who follow other forms of religious be
lief? In the firet place, the Catholic's
religious views are beliefs, not opinions.
And so sure are we that we have the truth
we contend that there can be no question
of error in the church's teaching; or, in
other words, that the Catholic church is
infallible in matters of faith and morals.
Now, since this is the belief of Catholics,
we would be very disingenuous if we said
one church was as good as any other.
"Another point 1 wish to make is that
man has no right to array himself against
the truth, when that truth has once been
made known to him. Above ali things
stands principle. The man who will go
back on his principles and espouse evil
knowingly is, to Americans, a thing ac
cursed.
"This American idea i? only the Catho
lic doctrine that man must be true to him
self and to his God. Adherence to prin
cipleâthat is the cornerstone of Catholic
truth, as it is also of true American citi
zenship.
"Yet how dreadful are the misrepresen
tations of Catholic truths heard on every
side. Particularly in the matter of salva
tion are these misrepresentations most
grewsome.
"Let it be once and for all understood
that the Catholic church teaches that
God'.T judgment* are proportioned to the
lights and graces which each individual
soul may have received. Even St. Thomas
Aquinas, who has been quoted on this
platform as the greatest of all connoisseurs
of fricasseed heretic, sustains this teaching
and proves that any other view would call
in question the justice of God.
"It is a crime In the eyes ot the church,
not sanctioned by any theologian, how
ever bloodthirsty, for a Catholic to believe
that any soul is in eternal torments. The
church keeps to the charitable view ex
pressed in the old saw :
Bel ween tbe saddle and the ground,
Mercy sought and mercy found.
'"The Catholic church believes in the un
covenanted mercies of God, which like the
genial showers of spring fall alike upon
the just and the unju-t.
"Now as to the slavery of the Catholic.
We are_ told that conscience cuts no figure
with him; that all he has to do is to obey
blindly, in order to be a first-class Catholic.
How foolish an assertion ! The Catholic
church does believe in an absolute sov
ereign over the souls of its members, and
that sovereign is conscience. Busenbaum,
an old theologian and a Jesuit to boot, says
that where a non-Catholic's conscience
does not urge him to enter the Catholic
church he cannot be held obliged to do so.
If from childhood he has been taugnt that
the Catholic church falsifies the word of
God and corrupts the souls of men the
same Busenbaum opines that such a one
could hardly address a Catholic on re
ligious matters with a safe conscience.
"As to the doctrine of the church in re
lation to religious toleration, it is laid
down in the constitution of the United
States. One may believe what he pleases,
butffreedom of "religious belief gives no
one ft right to molest others. It does not
give me the right to stand here and abuse
the religions Dractices of my Jewish friend,
nor to ridicule the baptism of the Baptists
or the camp-meetings of the Methodists.
"Yet we have heard ministers call our
ancient church the 'mother of harlots';
we have heard Catholic bodies stigmatized
as being lower than the women of the
town; we have heard God's ministering
angels, the Sisters of Charity, called every
thing unutterable and vile. Yet, if some
Catholic loses patience and tries to defend
the honor of his mother and his sisters,
then the cry of religous intolerance is
raised and the Catholics are called 'enemies
of free speech."
"One more question needs answer, and
that is: What is the relation between the
Catholic Church and politics? The moral
lawâ the law of honor, truth and justice
binds in political life, as it does in the life
of the soul. Beyond this we look for noth
ing. We believe that religion and politics
are both good in their respective places,
but we do not believe in mixing the two,
since the mixture is seldom a happy one.
A priest in politics makes a bad mess of
his religion, as a rule, and a worse mess of
his politics.
"Let the San Francisco clergy be judged
by their record. For half a century we
have had priests and bishops in this
Catholic City of St. Francis and never have
we heard of clerical interference in our
politics. But if we look toward the dis
senting preachers what a whirlpool of po
litical intrigue we are forced to contem
plate! And these ministers have charge
of cultured congregations! Let us pay
our respects to them. Their history dur
ing the past two years teems witli infamy.
â¢'But, "thank God, the Protestant preach
ers do not represent Protestants. Tie
Protestant people have more than on re
risen in their might and thrust forth irom
their churches teachers who were unworthy
to in the pulpit. The Protestants ol
this City are as anxious as the Catholics
for peace and concord. Protestants have
rebuked sowers of discord more than once.
"1 have tried in my own way to give

you an idea of the 'inner teaching' of the
Catholic church as to liberty of conscience.
We are devoted friends of American lib
erty and as faithful defenders of Ameri
can institutions as any. A Catholic who
is a bad citizen, and at the same time
claims to be a Catholic, that maÂ«i is a liar
and the truth is not in him. His grace,
the Archbishop, summed up the Catholic
view very neatly when he said : 'If a man
came to me and asked me to vote for him
because he was a Catholic I would feel it
my duty to vote against him.'
"God will not fail this country and this
flag. America is too great a land to he
dominated by any secret society of aliens
and cowards. "The God of justice and
mercy will save us from falling victims to
this latest and foulest emanation from the
deepest pit of hell."
Rabbi Levy and J. H. Barry of the Star

train of thought suggested by the lecturer,,
both being cordially applauded.
FOOLISH BEATRICE WEISE.
AccnÂ«Â«Â« a Boeni Spanish Nobleman of
Stealing Her Jewelry!
Louis Weiser met Beatrice Weise of 37
O Farrell street at the recent Hungarian
ball. He told her he was a Spanish noble
man and his wealth was almost un
bounded. She was fascinated by the dash
ing nobleman and invited him to call
upon her. He did so, and on Monday,
while with him, she had occasion to do
some business, and gave him the keys of
her room.
She did not see him again, and yester
day morning she discovered that all her
jewelry was missing. It consisted of a
diamond locket, diamond pin, amethyst
ring and turquoise locket.
She hurried to Judge Joachimsen's court
and swore to a complaint charging Weiser
with grand larceny. The police found
that Weiser was employed by Rosenblum
& Abrams, Seventh and Market streets,
and that he had in all probability left tbe
City, as he had not been seen since Mon
day.

WANTS NO FALSE PRICES
Why Secretary Morton Says He
Opposes Protection and
Silver.
CAN'T TELL ABOUT CLEVELAND
The Secretary's Story of His Life as
a Claim-Holder and Editor
Among Indians.
Secretary J. Sterling Morton of the De
partment of Agriculture, Washington, D.
I C, arrived here yesterday and is at the
He is, or was, a Nebraska farmer and
his farm is in Otto County and juts up to
Nebraska City. He settled on a claim
there in 1555, or forty-one years ago, and
has remained there ever since. Then there
was no railroad within 300 miles, and
bands of Indians were constantly in sight.
The Secretary is a man of medium
height, with blue eyes, gray hair and a
pray mustache. His head is big and his
! forehead high, giving the impression that
! he is an independent thinker, and this the
Secretary in his first few sentences seemed
i to verify.
Secretary Morton was one of the original
j founders of Nebraska City, a town now of
i between 11.000 and 12,000 people, and he is
j the only one of the town company now
living. He says that one of the striking
thincs of his frontier experience is the
recollection that Charles Dudley Warner
was the flagman of the first surveying
party that ever came through there.
Mr. Morton has been a newspaper man
as well as a farmer. He was one of the
owners of the Nebraska City News, the
oldest paper in Nebraska, and ran it for
many years. His first devil, as he told
yesterday, was John W. Freeman, now of
Woodland, who owns a large ranch
there and is widely known. Sam Davis of
the Carson Appeal was also for a time a
reporter on the News.
Secretary Morton has many interesting
reminiscences of those days and told stories
regarding all the people to which allusion
has been made.
He also talked of tbe tariff, silver, the
possibility of Cleveland running again,
and gave out his object in coming West,
"I had never been farther west, before
than Salt Lake, 1 ' he said, "nor farther
south than Doming. I had a curiosity to
see California. 1 came as the guest of my
son, Paul Morton, who is third vice-presi
dent and general traffic manager of the
Santa Fe Railroad. Of course, I want to
see what I can of the agricultural and
horticultural interests. I have been greatly
impressed with tbe agricultural resources.
"I think the prospects are good in tbe
United States for the 1896 crop. Winter
wheat may be a little short, but spring
wheat promises well. I suppose that agri
culture will fully maintain its former posi
tion. An average of more than 70 per
cent of the entire exports for the last five
years has come from the farm.
"As to whether Mr. Cleveland will run
fora third term or not I can't tell. I
don't think he has any desire for it. I
think the Democratic National Conven
tion will indorse Mr. Cleveland's financial
policy with the repealing by Congress of
the Sherman act compelling the pur
chase of $3,000,000 to $4,000,000 a month of
silver for free coinage.
"That ought to be indorsed. The Gov
ernment can't create values any more
in that can create souls. As an instance
of that, recall how worthless was the
Confederate paper-money at the close
the war, whereas, when the Confederacy
NEW TO-DAT.
stole the dies from the mint at New
Orleans ond from one in Georgia and
made gold coins, though they were ac
cordine to law counterfeit, they were
good, and are good in the circulation of
the country to this day.
"I oppose the coinage of silver on the
basis of 16 to 1, because it would put an
artificial price on silver. The Democratic
party can't straddle. It must either be for
sound money or silver. For the same rea
son that I oppose silver on an artificial
basis I oppose protection. I oppose pro
tection because it puts an artificial price
on things I want to buy."
Secretary Morton, shortly after arriving
in town made an inspection of the State
Board of Trade's exhibit at 16 Post street.
He spent over an hour examining the va
rious products of the State ana, although
he inspected the California exhibit at At
lanta last year, be expressed great surprise
that the resources of California were so
extensive.
Secretary Morton was particularly at
tracted by the splendid exhibit that has
just arrived from Kern County. This col
lection was made by W. S. Tevis, and by
him presented to Kern County.
It comprises all of the cereals, garden
and orchard products and minerals and
precious ores, all of a superior quality. In
the collection is a section of a castor-bean
shrub over 12 inches in diameter, a desert
cactus 12 feet high, from which a fine
quality of paper is made, and a California
eagle that measures 7 feet 4 inches from
tip to tip.
To-morrow the State Board of Trade
will hold its formal opening. Secretary
Morton and Governor Budd will be pres
ent and address the assembly. At noon
the guests will be invited to partake of a
repast of California products.
Secretary Morton is accompanied on his
trip by a large party, including several
relatives. He will be in the City and
vicinity about a week. At 1 o'clock this
afternoon he and his friends will go
aboard a steamer at the foot of Mission
street and be taken on a cruise of the bay.
A large party of Federal officials will go

FOR WOMEN WHO WORK.
The Kducational and Industrial Union
Asks for Recognition.
The Women's Educational and Indus
trial Union, at its quarterly meeting lasfc
night, appointed the following committee,
which will nominate the members of the
nominating committee: Mme. Louise Fer
rier, Mrs Dr. Bashpt, Miss Harriet Cooper
Mrs. L. C. Fraser and Mrs. B. F. Doyle. '
The employment committee reported
that there were a large number of women
who were much in need of work in the
line of sewing, and the committee sug
gested that the public be made aware of
this fact, for by placing work in the hands
of these women great good might be done.
Besides seamstresses, the union has
many governesses, teachers and women to
do housework, who are desirous of procur
ing situations.
It was stated that no charity could be
worthier than this, since by giving these
deserving women work to do an infinite
deal of good would be done, for which the
labor of the recipients themselves would
abundantly compensate.
POSTOFFICE ROBBED.
Thieves Loot the Puyallup Office but
Secure Leal Than Five
Dollars.
Chief Postal Inspector Munro received %
letter from the Postmaster at PuyalluD,
Washington, yesterday, announcing that
the office was entered on the night of May
7 and $4 50 in stamps and 55 cents in coin
stolen. An effort was made to blow open
the safe, but foiled, presumably because
the robbers were frightened away.
The letters of two mail pouches w<>â¢
rifled, but so far as known nothing of value
was secured. A special inspector was sent
to the scene of the robbery yesterday.
M. Eliseieff, a Russian traveler in the
Soudan, estimates the total strength of the
fighting men under the Khalifa Abdui'ah
at about 300,000. To this total the Baggara
Arabs contribute 40,000, all trained and
disciplined warriors.

HEAVY JUDGMENT
Latest Decision in the Hale
and Norcross
Case.
TWO SUMS IN ONE.
Judge Hebbard's Opinion on the
Charge of Fraudulent
Milling.
EETURNS WEEE PLAINLY FALSE
Together the Two Amounts Aggre
gate Far Over Six Hundred
Thousand.
One more decision in tbe Hale <fc Nor
cross case has been entered in the records,
this time by Judge Hebbard of the Supe
rior Court.
The decision was rendered in that phase
of the case which relates to the fraudulent
milling of the ore. It bad been tried be
fore Judge Hebbard and his judgment was
for $789,618. The Supreme Court reversed
this as being excessive, however, and it
was tried again before Judge Hibbard.
His decision yesterday scales down the
former judgment to $417,683. With this
judgment he rendered an opinion yester
day.
In the first part of his opinion Judge
Habbard quotes from the decisions of the
Supreme Court reversing his former judg
ment. Then he says:
The Supreme Court has directed this court
to find: The value of the ores of the Hale&
.Noreross Mining- Company delivered to the
Nevada and Mexican mills from January 1,
1887, to July 1, 1890; the amount of this
value necessarily lost in working or which
would not under fair . milling be separated
from the baser matter; the amount of money,
if any, received by the mills from the working
or sale of the tailings or residue of said ores;
the amount and value of the bullion that
should have been returned by the mill.
From these premises this court is directed to
find what amount of damage, if any, has been
sustained by the Hale & Xorcross Mining Com
pany.
From the conclusion that the Haie & Nor
cross Mining Company has sustained loss by
reason of the Imperfect and fraudulent mill
ing of its ores there is no possible escape.
Taking the great mass of seemingly conflict
ing evidence in the case, and calculating from
premises strained and enlarged to the utmost
in the defendants' favor, the result is still thai
the Nevada and Mexican mills, controlled by
Hay ward, Hobart and Levy, did not return to
the Hale & Norcross Company the amount of
bullion which In common honesty and fair
business dealing ought to have been returned.
Many witnesses called for defendants testi
fied that 70 or 75 per cent of the battery
sample assays would be a fair return, but this
conclusion is arbitrarily given, without re
gard for car or railroad car sample assays, and
independent of the actual value of the ore be
fore it went through the mill.
The court cannot rely upon this class of evi
dence founded entirely and absolutely upon
battery assays, for it is beyond question that
the battery sample assays of these ores taken
in these mills are incorrect and false, and can
not be properly employed as a basis upon
which to figure such percentages of returns.
From January 1, 1887, to January 1, 16190,
these assay returns of over 80,000 tons of ore
showed in no single month a percentage over
or equal to the car sample assays of the same;
they were invariably much lower. Consider
ing that all assays are somewhat speculative
and never absolutely exact, the fact that in all
this mass of ore there was scarcely a single
battery assay that, even by chance, went
higher than the car assay, is startling in its
evidence of deliberate, habitual design.
The witness D. B. Lyman testified that the
Nevada mill was well adapted for the proper
reduction of ores, yet its percentage of returns
does not compare favorably with those of Other
- ii. ills working Comstock ores, particularly the
Brunswick mill, at which Hale & Norcross
ores have fbeeu worked since this action was
commenced, with results so much more favor
able to the mining company as to absolutely
disprove the theory and the evidence that car
sample assays must necessarily and always be
too high.
The Brunswick mill worked these ores,
made large returns and in some instances the
battery assays were ia excess of the car sam
ple assays.
The following facts and figures are ad
mitted to be correctly shown by the record in
;hecase: Number of tons of ore from Hale &
Norcross mine milled at the Nevada and Mexi
can mills from January 1, 1887, to July 1,
1890, b4.068.1700: value of same as shown by
car sample assay, $3,224,28658; average value
of same per ton, car sample assay, $38 35.
Value of same as shown by battery sample
assay, $2,225,256 54; value of bullion re
turned by mills to mining company, $1,678,
-921 16. of which $718,345 was gold and
Â£960,576 17 silver; percentage of gold in bul
lion, .4268; percentage of silver in bullion,
.5722; average discount on silver during
period with standard at 1.2929, running from
92 to 1.06, .26112.
For the purpose of simplifying calculations
fractions of tons of ore and fractions of the
value thereof will be ignored. The value of
these ores delivered to these mills during the
r>eriod mentioned is $2,551,742, of which
$1,460,107 is silver and $1,091,635 gold.
This value is ascertained by deducting $8
per ton from the car sample assay value.
Example: Car sample value, $3,224,286; 84.
-068 tons at $8, $672,544; balance, $2,551,742.
That this amount of deduction lrom car
sample assay value will give the true value of
the ore delivered to the mills, as nearly as
practicable and as nearly as possible, is proved
by the testimony of witnesses on both sides.
And it Is also proven by the working of ores
and the returns thereof at the Con. Va. & Cal
Overman and Hale & Norcross Mining com
panies.
This deduction of $8 per ton is a most liberal
allowance. Plaintiff contends that a deduc
tion of $5 would be ample, and the evidence
above referred to would perhaps warrant an
average deduction of but $5.
The amount of the value of the ore delivered
to the mills, which was necessarily lost in
working or would not under fair milling be
separated from the baser matter and therefore
which is the amount to be deducted for loss, is
The loss Is made up as follows: Slimes,
$93,358 ; moisture, $32,214 tailings, $251 197 â¢'
total $381,769.
The evidence shows that the loss by slimes
and moisture is occasioned by the presence of
clay in the ore, and that the amount of clay is
about 10 per cent of the ore, and that the
amount of moisture is about 10 per cent of the
clay.
Ten per cent of 84,068 tons of ore is 8406
tons, which is clay consisting of Mimes and
moisture. Of this 840 tous is moisture and
7566 tons are slimes. Total. 8406 ton" of^clay.
The witnesses, Peck and Kinkead, say these
â limes assay sl3 per ton; 7566 tons of slimes
at $13 equals $98,358, which is the total loss
occasioned by slimes.
Giving the 840 tons of moisture the average
value per ton of the ore by car sample, which
is $38 35, then 840 tons of moisture at $38 35
equals $32,214 total loss occasioned by
moisture.
The tailings are that portion of the oro whicn,
after passing through the amalgamating pans,
runs out of the mill and is wasted.
Trie value of these tailings per ton is shown
tv the settler sample assays (plaintiff' exhibit
77).
The average of these settler sample assays, as
claimed by plaintiff, is $3 OS per ton. and as
claimed by defendants $3 38 per ton, the
Utter is adopted for the calculation.
As all the slimes and moisture are above ac
counted for, neither form a part of the tailings
fcr the purpose of the calculations. .. .
The total amount of the slimes and moisture
must be deducted from the amount of ore in
order to ascermin the amount of tailings: . "â â¢'-:.
Exampleâ Slimes 7566 tons, moisture 840
tons; total. 8406 tons.
Deduct 8406 tons, of slime* and moisture
from 84,068 tons of ore equals 75,662 tons of
tailings, without deducting the weight -of the
bullion: 75,662 tons multiplied by $3 32
eq.als $251,197, total loss occasioned by tail
ings, and dip king the total loss occasioned by
Klines, moisture and tailings, as aforesaid, the
amount of $381,769.
From the i value .of the ore delivered to the
miKsâ s2.ssl,742â deduct the total loss occa
sioned by slimes, moisture and tailings, $381,
-769, and the balance, - $2,169,973, is the
amount of bullion, with silver at 1.2929,
which ought to have been returned to the
Hale & Norcross Company. From this amount,
$2,1G9,973, deduct $1,678,921, the amount of
bullion, with silver at 1.2929, which was re
turned, and the balance, $491,053, is the ap
parent deficit; .5722 of this amount, or $ 280,
-980, is silver. Taking out of $280,980 the
average discount on silver, or .26112 thereof,
which is $73,369, and deducting this total dis
count for silver, $73,309 from $491,05. leaves
a balance of $417,683, which is the net deficit
and the amount in money which ought to have
been returned over and above the $1,678,921
which was returned In bullion, and this is the
amount, $417,683, which the court finds to be
the amount of damages sustained by the Hale
& A orcross Company by reason of the imper
fect and fraudulent milling of these ores.
Counsel for plaintiff calculate and claim
this result to be $651,223, and give strong
reasons therefor, but the court, considering the
elements of loss with a view to enter the
lowest judgment possible from the record upon
this issue, places the result at $417,683, or
less by $233,540 than the amount claimed by
plaintiff.
Other calculations may be made, based upon
the evidence in the case, shin-ing results of
$664,000, $668,894? and $680,547 respectively.

of the judgment, $417,638. .<
Koihing is added to the judgment by reason
of anything received by the mills from the
working or sale of the tailings or residues of
the ore. It appears, however, that some $15,
-000 was received by the Nevada mill from the
working of concentrates. .
John \V. Mackay, D. B. Lyman and other
witnesses testified that in the old days of the
Comstock the mining companies required a
return from tae mills of 65 per . cent of the
wagon sample assays in bullion; sometimes
they received a little more and sometimes a
little less, but if less than 65 per cent was re
turned the mills were called upon to make
and did make up the deficiency. In view of
this evidence it may be interesting to kuow
that the amount of bullion which ought to
have been returned to the Hale and Norcross
Company, as above found to be $2,169,973, is
about 67 per cent of the ore, $3,224,286, as
valued by the car sample assay, and it is more
than $12 50 per ton less than the average car
sample assay per ton of $38 35.
As to the defendants, Charles P. Eagan and
the Nevada Mill and Mining Company, the
action is dismissed, as they have not been
brought in by proper service of process.
As to all the other defendant directors, ex
cept H. M. Levy, the action is dismissed, be
cause it appears that they could be held liable
only for negligence, concerning- which no
issue is presented by the pleadings. ,
Let judgment be entered herein against the
defendants Alvinza Hayward and 11. M. Levy
for the sum of $210,197 50, with interest
thereon from the 11th day of June, 1892. at
the rate of 7 per cent per annum, upon the

PESCIA WILL BE CONSUL
The Italian Colony Pleased at
the Doctor's Appoint
ment.
Consul-General Grimaldi Alarmed for
the Safety of His Pretty
Turkish Wife.
For the last few months Cay. Bruni
Grimaldi, the Consul-General of Italy in
this City, has been negotiating witu his
Government for a long leave of absence.
His request was granted and the Consul
was also authorized to appoint the man
who should represent him in his absence
or replace him if he fails to return.
To the great satisfaction of the Italian
colony, the announcements were made
yesterday that the Consul's choice had
fallen on Dr. Pescia and that the doctor
bad consented to be acting Consul in the
absence of Cay. Bruni Grimaldi. Dr. .Pescia
is one of the most influential men in the
colony, and as he is also wellj known
amon k Americans it is believed that he
can fill the position of Italian Consul-
General to the satisfaction of all parties
concerned much better than a stranger to
this City could possibly do.
It is stated, however," that E. Scodeletti,
who for the last fifteen years has tilled the
position of secretary to the Italian Con
sulate, in not satisfied at the changes and
that he has rebiened.
Cay. Bruni Grimalai will shortly leave
this City for Armenia. He is married to a
beautiful young Turkish lady, and ever
since the Consul's arrival here from Den
ver, over a year a>;o, she and the two
Grimaldi children have boen visiting Mrs
Grimaldi's relations in Turkey in Asia.
The recent Armenian troubles have caused
the Consul considerable anxiety, as he
feared that in some of the uprisings his
family might be massacred. It is largely
to look aft-r their safety and bring them
back to America that he has demanded a
leave of absense, though he has no inten
tion of returning here immediately.
Cay. bruni Grimaldi was in the Ital
ian consulai service in this country fifteen
years ago. Later he served ia Japan and
Turkey, and it was in Constantinople that
he met the nandÃome young Turkish lady
who became his wife. When he consented
to her taking their two children from this
country, whither he had been transferred,
to visit relations in Armenia he had no
idea that the conditions in that U'lhappy
land were about to become so strained.
Ever since the troubles began Cay.
Grimaldi has watched the mails with deep
anxiety for the letters saying that all was
well with his wife and children, and he
has earnestly petitioned the Italian Minis
ter for Foreign Affairs to grant him leave
of absence. It is only within the la-t few
days thai bis request has been formally
granted, and he is now Hurrying his prep
arations to depart as soon as possible.
An Old Character Dies
"Buffalo Bill," alias "Pete," a Chinatown

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 13, 1896.
WEAVER TURNS
UN HIS ENEMIES
Board of Health Appointees
Charged With Serious
Crimes.
THE COOK DREW A KNIFE
Secrets of the Almshouse Made
Public by the Superin
tendent.
INMATES WEKE ASSAULTED.
A Serious Scandal Is Now Brewing
in the City and County
Poorhouse.
Weaver of the Alms
house after bearing patiently the assaults
on his character and ability that were
made during his recent trial by tbe Board
of Health, and which eventually resulted
in his dismissal to make room for a man
of the same political complexion as the
majority in the board, has at last turned
on his tormentors and returned a blow
that has fairly staggered the men who
have done Governor Budd's bidding.
During the entire investigation, so
called, which was held in secret and behind
closed doors, Sir. Weaver made no effort
to strike back beyond a quiet intimation
that some of the acts used to support
charges against him had been due to the
friction between himself and political ap
pointees of the present board, who refused
to keep up the discipline of the institution
and put his authority at naught. He
made no specific charges at the time, but
bent his energies to refute the accusations
against himself.
Now that the board has declared his
place vacant and appointed a Democratic
political hanger-on to* succeed him, he has
made public certain icts of some of the
board's employes that make the charces
against himself pale iuto insignificance.
At a meeting of the board held on Mon
day Mr. Weaver Bent in a communication
that places three of the employes ap
pointed by the board, and supposed not
only to be sober, industrious, competent
men, placed there because of their fitness
for the positions they occupy, in a very
peculiar light.
He opeulv charges Chief Cook Kearny,
on of the most recent appointees, and who
was lauded when his name was proposed,
with assaulting an inmate, presumably
decrepit and unable to resist, and pushing
him down stairs, pulling hair out of his
beard, and threatening to carve him with a
knife, which the cook drew during the
melee. Others are charged with like
offenses and with intemperance. The
bulk of the communication is as follows:
As superintendent of the City and County
Almhouse I will acquaint you with the follow
ing facts: On the morning of May 5, P. F.
Kearny, chief cook of the Almshouse, as
saulted an inmate named James Hudson. He
called him vile names, pushed him down
stairs and pulled hair out of bis beard. Kearny
then drew a knife and made threats of greater
bodily hsrru to Hudson. This attack was not
made in self-defense, but a premeditated as
sault in the presence of a number of witnesses,
who can be produced.
R. F. Julian, the farmer, attempted a violent
attack on James Coniff on April 18 last, and
the latter was rescued from injury through
tne assistance of bystanders. Witnesses 10
this assault 1 will produce at the request of
your board.
Dr. Charles J. Grant, who is the night watch
man in Hospital 3, 1 bud is wholly unfit for
his duties by reason of bis feeble health, old
age and intemperance. The sick and dying
are neglected by him and the dead are un
watched and uncared for during the night.
1 have not exercised the power I understand
I legally possess as superintendent to remove
these men, owing to the peculiar relations
that have existed lor some time between the
member.-, of the Board of Health and myself,
but UDon reflection have decided to submit
the facts to the Board and request an imme
diate investigation, offering at the same time
to present the proof for all the allegations I
have made.
The members of the board looked
askance at each other as their friends were
scorched by the superintendent, and when
the reading was finished a motion was
hastily made and carried that tne matter
be referred to the Hospital Committee.
To be sure that the Hospital Committee
should have the document at hand Dr.
Hart, a member of the committee, placed
it in his pocket. The only mention ot the
matter if. the minutes is that a communi
cation had been received from Superin
tendent Weaver and referred as stated.
It is understood that Mr. Weaver is pre
pared to bring other charges against the
board's appointees if these should be ig
nored.
SANTA ROSA ISLAND HEIRS
They Get Down to the Details
of John More's Admin
istration.
The Way in Which He Handled the
Funds Disclosed in Black
and White.
The hearing of the amended exceptions
in the Santa Rosa Island case was con
tinued before Judge Coffey yesterday.
The additional exceptions filed by tbe
heirs represented by Major Mhoon, as well
as those presented by Messrs. Gunnison,
Booth and Bartnett, show up John F.
More's administration of the Island's
affairs in detail.
The heirs of Alexander P. More, who
left his little principality in the hands of
his brother, as administrator, are deter
mined to get the facts and something like
$85,000 or $100,000. The heirs say he re
ceived $14,000 from the Western Meat
Company and failed to render an account
ing thereof; next on tne list is $300 re
ceived from the California Iron and
Wrecking Company, for supplies furnished
from the island, including shoes, tobacco,
meat, etc., and following thin sale of goods
not belonging to him, are others of a sim
ilar character, wherein certain laborers,
occasionally visiting the island, left $750
with Mr. More.
He also, it is alleged, failed to account
for $800 in rents, and did not turn over to
the estate $10,000 due as rent from himself
under the lease entered into with his de
ceased brother. Next on tbe list is an item
of $1056 tor freight on his own wool,
claimed to have been paid out of the funds
of tbe estate.
It is also recounted in the newly filed
papers that John F. More failed to turn
over to tne estate the 40,000 sheep en
trusted to him, and that the number was
15,000 short, and further that he shipped
6000 bead of sheep irom the island at a
time when he knew the total number oi*
the island, including those shipped, did
not exceed 32,000.
The heirs think it is highly improbable
that John F. will be able to account for
the discrepancies enumerated and they
are determined to rid the island and them
selves of his official domination as admin
istrator.
HE SOLD THE STOCK.
E. A. N Hughes, a Curbstone Broker,
Arrested on the Charge of Felony
Km be z/ lenient.
Charles A. Paxton, stockbroker, 314 Pine
street, swore to a complaint yesterday
afternoon before Justice of tbe Peace Groe
zinger, who is presiding in No. 1 Police
Court during the absence of Judge Camp
bell, charging E. A. N\, Huglies. a curb
stone broker, with felony embezzlement.
Paxton alleged that last Thursday
Hughes called at his office and asked to be
accommodated for an hour with 500 shares
of Potosi stock. As this is a usual courtesy
nmonj: brokerÃ Huehes 1 request was
granted. As he failed to keep his promise
to return the stock Paxton made inquiry
and found t at it had baen sola for $750.
The warrant was placed in the hands of
Detectives Seymour and Whittaker. and
they arrested Hughe3 in the Pacific Stock
Exchange on Leidesdorff street and took
him to the City Prison, where ho was de
tained on the charge.
Hughe^ claims that he borrowed the
stock from Paxton to accommodate Harris
& Co., the stockbrokers on Pine ana
Leidesdorff streets, who failed last week,
and that they must have disposed of it
and appropriated the proceeds.

To Be Lighted by Electricity.
Special Agent Powell of the Agricultural De
partment at Washington made a careful in
spection of the Appraisers' building and the
Postoffice yesterday, with a view of putting
electric lights in all the main corridors and
offices. Mr. Powell estimctes that 700 lights
will be required to properly cover the two
buildings. It is thought that the department
will not delay in authorizing the needed im
provements.
The Queen Libel Suit
The hearing of the libel suit of the Bancroft-
Whitney Company vs. the Pacific Coast Steam

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
â¢t station indicate maximum temperature for Hit
days: those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredth;*,
daring the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; Iso
therms. or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accomoanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows'* usually first appear on the Washington
coast. Whin .the pressure is high in the interiot
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south alone the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is Improb
able. With a -t-.u-h" in ihe vicinity of Idaho, anil
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition*
Will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS. â¢
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 12.-International
matters were the controlling influence at the Stock
Exchange to-day. 'â  At the opening speculation was
characterized by strength, the better on tlooic for
an amicable settlement of the difficulties gro.vlng
out of the seizure of the American schooner Com
petitor by the Spanish Government having led to
fairly large purchases for both foreign and home
account. London bought nearly 10,000 shares of
stock, St. Paul and Louisville A Nashville figuring
most prominently in the dealings. - The early rise
was . from V* to.lVi per cent, the Industrials,
(iranpers and internationals leading. The liuyinz,
howwer, was soon exhausted, and it period of dull
ness followed.
. In the- afternoon trading the market was more
active, 'and prices declim-d throughout the .Ist.
The selling was based on reports of Anzlo-KusJian
dispute over territory In the Che Foo and partly to
the failure of the leading (.(-publican candidate for
the Presidential nomination to announce his posi
tion on the currency quest ion. it maybe added
tha: the professional bears are taking full advan
lace of the latter to bring about liquidations. The
decline In prices during the afternoon ranged from
%to 23/ 8 per cent, Manhattan leading. Near the
dose, on buying to cover shorts, prices advanced
fractionally. â  . . . -

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111,, May 12.â Government
report of the winter wheat issued to-day was of a
bearish nature, but it bad been so largely dis
counted by the trade that Its immediate effect this
morning was not as great as might have been had
not the gain In condition been anticipated. Yes
terday's rains through the winter wheat region
were instrumental in weakening the market after
a somewhat firm opening. About three-quarters
of a cent decline from the bes - price at the open
ing took place before the feeling steadied. .Late
this afternoon cables quoted 1 2 d aavance In Liv
erpool, early ones were V2<l lower, wnich Intelli
gence changed the aspect of affairs, a complete re
covery taking place.
Ri-ceipts at Chicago were seventeen cars, and
32.500 bushels were withdrawn from store. The
Northwest had 618 cars against 531 last Tuesday
and 149 a year ago- Export clearances amounted
to 206,000 bushels. Bradstreet's reported a de
crease in the world's available supplies of
3,029,000 bushels, prices exhibiting firmness
when the figures were ascertained. Closing Con
tinental cables were irregular. July wheat opened
from 63yH@63c, sold between 62Vfec and 64@
t34 VÂ«c, closing at the outside, %c higher than yes
terday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow seven
teen cars.
CORNâ The market participated In the various
changes of feeling and sentiment of wheat. It
was dull, nevertheless, and the amount of trading
at the different quotations was light and unimport
ant. Liverpool cables were quiet and unchanged.
Receipts were 205 cars, aud 203,218 bushels were
withdrawn from store. Export clearances
amounted to 258.450 bushels. Bradstreet's re
ported a decrease in stocks of 360.000 bushels.
July corn opened from 30c to SOVgC, sold between
29% c and 30s/ B e, closing at 30Vi@30%c. VsÂ® 1 /! 0
higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts lor 10
-morrow 115 cars.
OaTS â The vagaries of wheat and corn vere re
flected in oats. There was at the same time an
undertone current of firmness. Receipts were 22

Davie's Dream*.
OAKLAND. Cal., May 12.â Mayor DaviÂ«
to-day said: -'The Council is spending
money recklessly, but it will do no good.
Tie Supreme Court has lately decided that
a Council cannot order work one year to
be paid out of the money of the next. The
Council has voted about"$80,000 to be taken
out of next year's funds, which I will stop
when the proper time comes. If the Coun
oilmen wane to make repairs and expendi
tures they talk so much about let them
put it in the tax levy."

"NO PLACE LIKE HOME"
Davis Announces That He Will
Not Hear of a Congressional
Nomination.
Hilborn Seems to Have an Excel'ent
Prospect to Succeed Him
self.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, )
908 Broadway, May 12. j
To-day's developments in the hght for
the Republican Congressional nomina
tion have placed that struggle in a new
light.
Judge Frick has openly declared that
he is not a candidate to succeed himself,
but that he is strictly in the Congressional
race.
Ex-Mayor W. R. Davis has been asked
by hundreds of Republicans to run for the
oll\ce, but he has positively declined. He
said that he was supporting Mr. Hilbcrn ;
that the latter was at his post of duty
and had rendered a pood account of him
self; that in his first term Mr. Hilborn
was hampered by a contest and eventually
unseated, so that he served but a frag
ment of his term; that in bis present
term up to date he has had time only to
get a fair start, and that it would be pol
icy to keep him there. "I will refuse to
consider a proposition to be a candidate
for Congress," said Mr. I>aviÂ°.
At the Third Congressional District Con
vention, conducted by the primary dele
gates, the following resolution was unani
mously passed:
Ruolred. That we heartily commend and ap
7>rove the cour>Â« of our Congressman, Hon. S.
G. Ililborn, as our representative in Congress,
and we recognize and appreciate his fidelity in
the discharge of his important trust.
Although Judge Frick has many friends,
at present it is an open secret that they
are more anxious to see Judge (Jreene
have a clear road to succeed himseif than
to send Frick to Washington. With all
the indorsements he hns received, and
with the positive statement that Mr. Davis
will not enter the race, it will require some
remarkable manipulating to prevent Mr.
Hilborn from being renorninated, although
it is agreed on all sides that whoever does
get the Republican nomination will be the
next Congressman from this district.
W. H. Friend, one of the leaders in the
primary election movement in this county
?aid to-day: "I do not think that there
will be anymore movements of importance
in local politics until after the Fourth of
July. It would manifestly be out of order
to call a Congressional convention until
nfterthe St. Louis convention, which will
meet June 16 and last several days.
Then thÂ«re will be a hurrah period lasting
till the Fourth of July, and after that we
will get down to business again.''
The numerous candidates that are de
claring themselves, or being declared by
their friends, are as numerous as bees, but
it is safe to say that a vast majority of
their booms will have disappeared before
the convention meets.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 13, 1896.
THEY EXPECTED
"A GOOD TIME"
Alameda Supervisors Sur
prised When They
Found Brains.
HAD NOTHING TO SAY.
Johnson Hurried Back to Oak
land to Retrieve Their
Dignity.
HIS EFFORT WAS TOO LATE.
Before Any Showing Could Be Made
the Convention Had Finally
Adjourned.
Oakland Offick Ban Frakcibco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 12. J
The Alameda County Supervisors went
to San Jose expecting that the convention
of Supervisors from all over the State
would result as most such conventions do,
in having a good time. They were awfully
disappointed, somewhat chagrined and
very much surprised at the result. When
the minutes of that convention are pub
lished the rest of the State will conclude
that Alameda County was not represented
at all.
This result was brought about by a mis
conception on the part of the Alameda
board. When the invitation to attend the
convention was received Mr. Church suc
gested that it be accepted and "we all go
down and have a good time." That hnr
ried assumption was a very grave error.
Whatever previous conventions called for
similar purposes may have produced, this
one that clos* d at San Jose to-day was one
conducted on business-like principles.
The various {Supervisors went to it pre
pared to show by charts and figures just
what they were doing and how others
might benefit from (heir experience in
specific directions. It was an interesting
and valuable lot of data that was presented
and all went well until some one unfor
tunately proposed that the gentlemen
from Alameda should be heard from. The
"gentlemen from Alameda" were Super
visors Church, Johnson and finiley, and
they had gone prepared for nothing but "a
good time," never dreaming that the State
convention of Supervisors would develop
anything more interesting than a discus
sion on good roads held in the Oakland
boardroom a few months ago.
Consternation was expressed on the
faces of the Oakland trio and they
asked for time. They had to do some
thing, they knew nut what, but they real
ized that the "good time" was only a
dream, and that their brother Supervis
ors were stupid enougti to expect some
intelligent epitome of how Alameda
County's business was conducted.
Supervisor Johnson was sent back post
ha&te to Oakland with instructions to
"bring something," though what, he
scarcely knew. He rushed into the County
Clerk's office this morning and asked
County Clerk Jordan "for a history of the
county in half an hour."
Mr. Jordan was staggered, but he imrne
mediately set his deputies to work and by
noon whole columns of figures were ready
and Mr..Johnson was packing them in his
valise ready to catch the 2:15 p. m. train for
San Jose.
Soon after Mr. Johnson had lert and long
before he was within a dozen mile 3of the
convention, a dispatch was received at the
County Clerk's office saying *hat the Su
pervisors had adjourned and that the data
would be too late.
Now everybody is wonderinp how Ala
meda will be treated in the published min
utes of the convention.
MRS. COLEMAN'S DEATH.
Widow of the Late W. T. Coleman Diet
Very Unexpectedly- at Her
SUter's Home.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 12.â Mrs. Cassie
M. P. Coleman, widow of tue late W. T.
Coleman, the San Francisco pioneer and
capitalist, died very suddenly and unex
pectedly at the home of her sister, Mrs. H.
D. Bacon, 960 Oak street, this morning.
She had only been in the city a week.
Mrs. Coleman bad been in feeble health
ever since her husband died about three
years ago, but her death was not antici
pated at this time. Her only surviving
child is Robert L. Coleman, who is mar
rieu and resides at Burlingame.
The life of her husband, William T.
Coleman, is closely identified with the
early history of California and he was a
leader in the famous Vigilance Committee
tbat did bo much to clear San Francisco
of the tough characters tbat swarmed into
the City.
The deceased was Miss Carrie M. Page,
a daughter of D. D. Page, a well-known
Bostonian and now a St/ Louis capitalist.
Mr. Coleman had been in California from
1849, and in 1852 returned East and claimed
his school-girl friend as a bride. They
resided in New York City for some|time,
and it was here that C. Carleton Coleman
was born. They later moved to St. Louis,
where Robert L. Coleman was born. In
1870 Mrs. Coleman came to San Francisco
to join her husband, who had been here
for several years.
Both s; ns grew up and married, but C.
Carleton died several years ago, leaving a
son. No arrangements have been made
for the funeral, but it will be private and
the remains sent East, to be placed in the
family vault beside those of her husband.

OAKLAND'S EXPOSITION
This Year Will Be on a Much Larger
Scale, With .Many Attractions
Added.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 12.â The direc
tors of the Oakland exposition held an en
thusiastic meeting last evening, with Vice-
President Keller in the chair. Those pres
ent were: Messrs. Booth, Roeth, Sharp,
Gier, Trowbridge, Becker and Bell. The
unanimous opinion of all present was that
the exposition this year should be held
early in August, although the exact date
was left until the next meeting, May 21.
It was suggested that by fencing in the
whole vacant lot surrounding the main
building and covering it with canvas a
sort of summer garden could be created by
means of plants, flo%vers, evergreens and
shrubbery in boxes, and which lighted up
at night by electricity would produce a
charming resort, which at this time of the
yrar would prove very popular, in view of
the fact that the admission is to be kept at
last year's very popular prices.
These grounds would be fitted out with
refreshment booths, shady nooks and
walks, with music to add to its attractive
ness. It was also shown that by having
ibe exposition in August the display of
fruit could be made a very important feat
ure, and that the active co- operation of
the outside districts of the county would
thus be enlisted in making it a grand suc
cess.
A new feature for this year will be the
special days for the various towns in the I
county, when it is expected the residents J
of the town whose day it is will prepare
and present the programme. In this way
there will be a varied programme and each
section will be given a grand opportunity
to show the features to the best advantage.
It will be a day and evening devoted to the
setting forth of the advantages of that sec
tion.

SUBURBAN BLAZE.
Owing to a Lack of Protection Three
Dwelling* Are Destroyed.
OAKLAND, Cal.. May 12. -The two
story residence of H. J. Schlichtman at
Grace and Los Anpelea streets, in the
suburban district north of the city, took
fire this morning about 3 o'clock, and
owing to a lack of water or apparatus to
fiunt the -flames they and the house ad
joining belonging: to Mr. fc-chlichtraan'a
son, were completely destroyed, with their
contents.
The fire then attacked the Abbott cot
tage, but here it was checked, although
not until the cottage was gutted.
The residents of the vicinity gathered
quickly, bul could do nothing. At 3:25
an alarm was turned in from box 4, at
Twenty-eighth arid Adeline streets, and
the North Oakland chemical engine re
sponded, but only in time to keep the
fire from spreading from the Abbott cot
tage to D. H. Huyes' residence, adjoining.
The los 3is estimated at about $10,000;
partially insured.

The wedding of Miss Lizzie Auld of this
city to Dr. B. F. Simmons of Haywards
was one of the prettiest ever seen at the
First Presbyterian Church. The bride is
a well-known society young lady, and as
popular as sh6 is pretty. Dr. Simmons is
a dentist of Haywards.
There was only one bridesmaid, Mrs.
Lemogr. a sister of the bride. Rev. Dr.
Coyle officiated, and George A. Simmons,
a brother of the groom, acted as best man.
Only intimate friends of the bride and
groom were present, but they were sutli
cient to fill a large portion of the church.
The bride was elegantly attired, and wore
a bridal veil that was fastened with a tiara
of orange blossoms.
After the ceremony Dr. and Mrs. Sim
mons left for a tour of the southern part
of the State, and will spend some time at
Los Angeles. After their return they will
reside permanently in Dr. Simmons' home
at Haywards.

trict Attorney Church, who prepared|the

sity. The graduating exercises will be held
in Harmon Gymnasium, on the campus,
at 2:30 o'clock in the afternoon.
Recorder Button stated to-day that a
class of 145 will be recommended for de
! grees by the Academic Council of the uni
j verrity to the Board of Regents. Should
i the board grant diplomas to the entire

ber twenty more than last year. It is ex

to have spoken, but he has been excused
from so doing at his own request.
In the morning a general reunion of the
alumni will be held. It is the hope of the
association through the plans outlined for
to-morrow to give a new lease of life to
thfl formerly existent custom of setting
aside one day in the year as "Alumni
day." Following will be the order of ex
ercises which they will observe:
9:30 a. m.â Presentation of the graduating
H. H. HIRST.
class to the regents of the university and to
the Alumni Association in Bacon Art Gallery.

BERKELEY. Cal., May 12.â Harry H.
Hirst, a student in the College of Civil
Engineering at the State University, will
be recommended by the Academic Coun
cil to the Board of Regents at their annual
meeting in Berkeley to-morrow morning
as the medalist for the class of '96.
It was net known until late last night
who would be recommended as the most
distineuished etudent in the class, and it
is understood that there was considerable
wrangling among the professors before a
decision could be reached, as several
! others were close upon the trail of Hirst.
j Theodore de Laguna, Miss Eleanor Ben
| nett and Hubert Wyckoff ranked with
j very nigh sections in scholarship and the
! awarding of the medal stood between
j Hirst and one of these three.
Hirst is the first student who has
I ever been recommended for the medal
I from the College of Civil Engineering, and
I the professors in that department are
. much elated over their success and the
I success of the prospective honor man.
Hirst is just 23 years of age and was pre-
I pared for college at Cheney Academy,
' fepokane County, Washington. Last year,
the medalist, Miss Katherine Felton,
I refused the medal when it was tendered to
I her. but Hirst says that he will accept it
; should it be offered to him.
Working for Suffrage.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 12.â The ladies
of the Citizen Suffrage League of Berkeley
are working with unabated vigor in the
cause of amendment 11, and have decided
to interview personally every voter in the

! election-day every voter in Berkeley will
have been asked to vote for woman

Those who do notacquiesce in the move
ment advocated by the ladies will be ap

their efforts to showing him the reasons
why woman's voice in politics should be
as strong as that of man.
The woman suffragists of the Berkeley
society will secure a full list of the voters
of the town, which is divided into thirteen
precincts. A seperate list will be made f"r
each precinct and the lists will be given
to thirteen ladies of the Suffrage League,
who will then interview the voters.
Citizens who Uo not yield readily to the
arguments of the fair politicians will be
reasoned with a second time, for after the
first thirteen ladies have done all they can
the lists will be given to other ladies, who
will in turn see all the men who have re
fused to capitulate at the first interview.
New Liquor Ordinance.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 12.â A new
liquor ordinance has been passed to print
by the Town Trustees. It is substantially
the same as the present law, the principal
difference being in the clause that pro
hibits the storing of liquor without a li
cense. In the new law the amount which
may be kept without a license is placed at
half a gallon.
WATSON'S LAST LECTURE.
The Celebrated Professor Compare!
Greek and Christian Ideals.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 12.â Dr. John
Watson, the eminent Canadian philoso
pher, delivered the last of his series of
public addresses on philosophy to-night
at Harmon Gymnasium to a well-nllea
house. The topic of his address was the
'Greek and Christian Ideals of Life." He
compared the Greek and the Christian
ideals of life, considering first Christianity
as originally taught by its founder and
secondly as afterward modified.
"The essential leature of religion," ho
said, "is the consciousness of the principle
tliat gives meaning to life and enables in
dividuals to look beyond the evils of the
present. If a religion does not idealize
life it has no effect. 'â¢
He defined religion as a principle of
consciousness or unity that is manifest in
the world we know. The early Greek re
lipion conceived the divine as revealed in
nature in an indefinite way, such as in the
trees, the running brooks, the skies, the
sun and the moon.
Christ gave the new starting point. The
true source of immorality is the eternal
violation of the law of love. Ihe ultimate
source of morality it traced to religion be
cause the love of God is identical with the
love of man. There is no absolute inter
vention between the ideal and the real.
The world is not in subjection to the
influences of evil but to the influences of
God. The power of the wicked is yiven to
them for the highest manifestation of
Kood. The power of evil can be overcome
only by the implements of self-sacrifice
and loving impulses.

"KNOWLEDGE IS POW_R."
Therefore consult the treat clairvoyants,
PROFS. EUGENE AND VAN DX VERE,
1728 MARKET ST. ,
Their readings astonish the most skeptical. All
I are satisfied. The professors give advice on all
i matters that are of interest to humanity. Busi-
: ness, speculation, investments, insurance, love,
I courtship, marriage and divorce: settle lovers'
quarrels and cause speedy and happy marriages.
They locate mines and burled treasures, find lost I
' or stolen property, interpret dreams, cure Dad
i habits and destroy evil influence* in half the
j lime required by the best of the other mediums.
I Remember, there are but few mediums in the
i world that can work these wonders, and none out-
! side of the eminent professors in san Francisco.
Remember also that the professors are perma-
nently located in San Francisco: they are here to
stay. Hours 10 a. m. io Bp. _. Sundays 2 to 6p. m.

SHE FOUND HIS
CHARMER'S LETTERS
Why Justice Carroll and
His Wife Have
Separated.
A DIVORCE MAY RESULT.
The Sensational Scene That
Took Place in a Court
room.
HIS HONOR'S CONTUSED EYE.
Fair Company and a Penchant for
Tender Epistles Caused All
the Trouble.
Justice of tbe Peace Carroll and his wife
no longer dwell together in the peace and
harmony that characterized the first few
years of their wedded life, and while an
agreed separation is all that exists at the
present time, a divorce is by no means un
certain.
Tbe strained relations in tbe Carroll
family are the result of a sensational
scene that took place in the Judge's court
room at the City Hall a few days ago.
Mrs. Carroll called at the court to see
her husband during the noon hour, but he
had gone out to his luncheon, and she sat
down at his desk to await his return.
With wifely solicitude she was straight
ening out the papers that encumbered the
desk when her eye fell upon a half wr tten
letter that had been began on a pad of
notepaper.
It began, "Dearest Marie," and went on,
with frequently repealed terms of endear
ment, to ask why the person for whom it
was intended had failed to meet the writer
on the evening previous at a place men
tioned in the letter.
A glance was sufficient to show Mrs.
Carroll that tbe writer was her husband,
and she immediately began a hurried
search for more documentary evidence.
Her efforts were rewarded by the unearth
ing of a number of letters written in fem
inine hands and signed Cora, Melrose and
other names. â¢â 
A ll were replete with terms of endear
ment for tbe judicial light, and were
promptly transferred to Mrs. Carroll's ret
icule, where they were when the Judge re
turned.
Mrs. Carroll did not make much of a
scene at that time, but when the Justice
returned to his fireside that evening the
meeting, as described by Mrs. Carroll to
some of her intimate friends, was the re
verse of pleasant, and the Judge carried a
large and painful lump over his eye for
some days ; in fact the scar is there yet.
When she had time to think the matter
over Mrs. Carroll remembered that during
the last yearâ since his election to the
Justiceship â Judge Carroll had frequently
been absent from home days at a time.
On these occasions he was supposed to
be on hunting expeditions in the interior,
or on some favorite trout stream with an
attorney friend, but Mrs. Carroll now be
lieves that he spent the time in the com
pany of tbe fair ones whose letters were
so tenderly cherished in his desk.
Her suspicions in this line have partially
oeen confirmed by the register of the
Baldwin Hotel, where his name is said to
appear on dates when he should, accord
ing to the stories he told at home, have
been on Tulare Lake slaughtering ducks.
Since the night when Judge Carroll's
head came into contact with something
harder than itself the family residence on
Clay and Fillmore streets has seen him
not, and his present place of residence has
been carefully kept from all but his most
Intimate friends, though it is said that a
downtown hotel shelters him most of the
time.
Up to the time he was elevated to public
honors Judge Carroll was for several years
a clerk in the law office of Colonel Barry,
and was looked upon as a steady and hard
working student of the law.
With increased income and influence,
however, he acquired sporting friends who
wined and dined him until he became a
devote at the shrine of Bacchus and a
frequent visitor at the racetrack. At the
latter place he was often a heavy loser,
and on one occasion was swindled out of
several hundred dollars by having a worth
less check passed on him. Then began tbe
periods of absence from home, ending in
the sensational climax in bis own court
room.
Mr. and Mrs. Carroll have been married
over ten years and have five children, who
are with the mother at the Clay-atreet
residence.
The matter has become public talk in
the portion of the Western Addition where
the Carrolls are well known, and the lady's
friends are urging her to procure a
divorce â an action which she hesitates to
take on account of the scandal that it
would involve. At present she is satisfied
to let the matter rest as it is and live
separate from her husband on a liberal
income furnished by him.

THE TRADES UNIONS.
Organizing the Woodworkers â The
Painters' Picnic.
Several days ago tbe Woodworkers' Union
issued a call for a mass-meeting to be held
for the purpose of organizing all the mill
and bench hands, and in fact all who earn
a livins in these lines. August Mueller
presided over the meeting, which was held
at 1159 Mission street, according to the
programme. The speakers were George
Postler, R. T. Mclvor, one of the agents
for the Building Trades Council, and sev
eral others.
They urged the non-union men to join
the union of their craft, and illustrated in
plain, simple language the advantages of
organization. They showed that men
united for their mutual benefit are able to
accomplish much more than men who
strive to light the battle of life alone and
unsupported by their fellowmen. These
meetings have brought a number of work
men into the unions who never before
understood the principles of unionism.
The Painters' Union is making great
preparations for the picnic that is to be
held next Sunday at Sunset Park. Among
the principal features will be a tug of war,

The Trades and Labor Alliance, San Fran

Tailors' Union of San Francisco, all want
the new union to affiliate with their re
spective bodies. Last evening by chance
thirteen delegates from these three bodies
met in the earment-makers' meeting and
consumed the entire session in presenting
their respective claims for preference.
The situation was a little awkward on
account of the opposite positions of the
Alliance and the Trades Council.

GOV. BUDD IS
FOR PATTISON
Whitney May Be Good, but
the Pennsylvanian
Is Better.
NO LACE OF MATERIAL.
The Governor's Views on the
Money Question Are Not
Expressed.
RESERVED FOR FUTURE TALK.
Free and Unlimited Coinage of Silver,
So Dear to Californians, Is
Amiably Slighted.
Governor Budd of California has ex
pressed his preference for a Democratic
candidate for President of the United
States.
Two weeks aeo The Call interviewed
Regent John E. Budd in regard to the
latter's preference, but the new regent of
the university from Stockton was non
committal, beyond expressing the opinion
that the candidate of the Democratic party
should be a Western man. When pressed
to name a Western man of the right size
nationally and intellectually the Gov
ernor's brother was silent.
Fearine that family diffidence was con
straining the regent to silence the obvious
ly embarrassing inquiry was not pressed.
John E. Budd did not say that California
was a Western State, but his manner in
dicated tbat a California candidate was in
his mind.
Yesterday tne Governor himself was in
terviewed, and he was not as si>y as one
might suppose. When asked if fie had a
Presidential preference among Democrats,
he frankly said:
"Yes. my preference is ex-Governor Pat
tison of Pennsylvania. He is very popu
lar in that State. lie has gained election
to the highest office in a State largely Re
publican. He has shown strength of char
acter and sound judgment. Whitney is
mentioned as a candidate, but it is my
opinion that the choice should rest on
Pattison."
"What is Governor Pattison's attitude
on the silver question?" was asked.
"I have not studied his position in that
respect thoroughly," replied the Gov
ernor.
'What views, Governor, do you enter
tain yourself on the money question?"
"I nave not expressed my views on that
subject."
"Are you in favor of the free coinage of
silver?"
"I have concluded not to express my
views at present on that subject," the
Governor amiably replied.
Then he reverted to the coming National
Convention of the Democratic party, re
marking that there would be plenty of
Presidential material before the conven
tion and ample opportunity for the ex
pression of opinion* on the money ques
tion. â 
NOT QUIRK THE PENMAN
Dean, the Nevada Bank Forger,
Denies That He Was an
Accomplice.
The Imprisoned Man Thinks His Own
Punishment Is Only a Ques
tion of Years.
The one man above all others who ought
to know whether or not there is any truth
in the reported indictment of "Quirk the
penman" in the celebrated Nevada Bank
forgery case declares most emphatically
that there is not a word of truth in it.
That man is A. H. Dean.
Ever Bince bis arrest in Minneapolis
some three months ago by Detectives
Whittaker and Seymour the genteel-ap
pearing "manufacturers' agent," who ex
changed a $12 draft for $20,000 in gold coin,
has been the sole occupant of cell 31 in the
new City Hall Prison, where he patiently
awaits the slow process of law, which is to
mete out his punishment for a crime
already confessed. With Dean the ques
tion of imprisonment is one of years only.
He hopes for nothing but a sentence
tempered with mercy. Confessions or ad
missions beyond those made at the time of
his arrest would avail him nothing. The
case against him was so thoroughly worked
up by Captain Lees and Detectives Whit
taker ana Seymour that there was nothing
left for Dean to do but confess his guilt.
Being a man of intelligence he saw at a
glance that no loophole of escape had been
left by the detectives, so he concluded to
make the best of a bad bargain and con
fess everything, which he did months ago.
In consideration of this and the fact that
he thus saves the Btate what would other
wise be a long and expensive trial, he ex
pects the mercy usually accorded to peni
tent prisoners.
Since his incarceration Dean has had
but few visitors and devotes most of his
time to reading and writing letters. His
daily budget of mail is large, showing that
he has a wide circle of acquaintances. He
exercises by daily walks in the corridor of
the detention department, and although a
ready and entertaining conversationalist
he never speaks of bis case or of criminal
matters generally. Unlike most prisoners,
he is uncomplaining md entertains no
feeling of hatred for those who were in
strumental in his capture. He realizes
that his case was skillfully worked np and
that no unfair advantage was taken of him
in its presentation. Aside from the fact
that he has confessed to the crime, there
is nothing in the appearance of Dean to
indicate that he is a criminal. In manner,
dress and speech he would readily pass for
the prison chaplain.

SWINDLED BY A
BOGUS COUNT
The Successful Operations
of a Dapper Little
Man.
LORD VAN DE LEON.
He Worked the Leading Hotels
in New York, Chicago and
St Paul.
MADE HIMSELF FELT HERE.
The Police Have Been Searching for
Him, bat He Has Given Them
the Slip.
For the past two or three weeks two of
the most astute local detectives have been
endeavoring to discover tbe whereabouts
of a dapper little swindler who poses as a
Count of France and Italy.
In the East, where he was successful in
pullin* the wool over the eyes of numerous
men of wealth and procuring large sums
of money from them, he was known as
Count Van de Leon.
lie is a small man, about five feet tall,
rather dark, patrician face, small dark
mustache, curled at the ends, wears gold
rimmed eyeglasses and dresses in the
height of fashion. He is fond of wearing
a golf cap. He speaks German, French
and Italian with the greatest fluency.
A lew months ago he turned up in the
Hoffman House, New York. He soon
made it known that ha belonged to one of
the most illustrious of French families
and aroused the sympathies of the guests
by telling tnem that he wa3 temporarily
embarrassed. To those who took an in
terest in his tale of woe he showed a
"faKe" cablegram from Paris that a draft
for several thousand francs was on the
way to him. He succeeded in eetting
altogether between $3000 and $4000 and
then he quietly disappeared.
Soon afterward be made his appearance
in the Palmer House, Chicago. He
worked the same game successfully upon
the guests there. He also made him?eif
known to several of tbe leading jewelers
and by various pretext* he contrived to
get possession of several thousand dollars'
worth of diamonds and absconded with
them.
From Chicago he went to St. Paul,
where he registered at the Ryan Hotel.
While there he made the acquaintance of
a leading photographer, named Francis.
He treated Francis to a few bottles of
wine, and then told him that he was a
French Count, a little short of funds, but
expected a remittance from Paris in a few
days. Francis was only too glad to ad
vance him $100. Next day he gave him
another $100, but when he made his third
request. Francis heaituted. The Count
then told him that on his way to St. Paul
be and three men happened to be the only
occupants of the Pullman car. The three
men stole his satchel from him, which
contained several thousand francs, and
jumped off the train with it. He jumped
after them, spraining his ankle, and they
escaped. Francis credited his story and
gave him $300 more.
The Count got introduced to society in
St. Paul and won the affections of a young
lady, the daughter of a wealthy resident.
Tney were engaged to be married and the
Count by some means or other got posses
sion of her diamonds. Her father learned
of it and went gunning for bis prospective
son-in-law, who made bis escape and came
to this City.
He soon made his presence known here
by introducing himself as an Italian Count
and swindling several of the leading citi
zens of that nationality out of various
sums of money.
One of his victims complained to the po
lice, and from the description Captain Lees
came to the conclusion that he was the
same swindler who had been operating so
successfully in the East.
Two detectives were detailed to arrest
him and thn search has been vigorously
kept up, but yesterday they were forced to
the conclusion that he had given them the
slip. It is believed that he has gone to
Mexico, where he will probably soon be
heard of.
PIRACY, SUICIDE,
INSOLVENCY, LIBEL
Interesting Points Involved
in a Los Angeles
Lawsuit.
E. D'ARTOIS' GRIEVANCES
"Union Nouvelle" Says That He
Is the Son of a Mexi
can Pirate.
y
DAYS OF MAXIMILIAN REVIVED
The Father of the Plaintiff Committed
Suicide in This City Ten
Years Ago.
Piracy, suicide and a failure for several
thousand dollars is involved in a suit for
criminal libel recently filed in Los Angeles
by one Emil d'Artois against a French
paper of that city.
The early part of the story really centers
in this City, because it is on the evidence
obtainable here that the claimant hopes to
win his suit.
Some weeks ago Emil d'Artois of Los
Angeles went into insolvency. On April
1. Le Petit Californien published an article
saying that d'Artois was the same man
who had been tried for piracy many years
before.
The Union Nouvelle, a French paper
published in the same city, declared that
the man who had just gone into insolv
ency was not the pirate, but his sonâ the
pirate himself had committed suicide in
San Francisco in the early part of 1886.
Emil d'Artois thereupon began a suit
for criminal Jibel against the French paper
which had declared him to be the son of a
pirate. The proprietors of the journal
immediately employed Attorney Scott of
Los Angeles to look up the facts in the
case and that gentleman has succeeded in
making up a lot of ancient interesting
data.
It appears that on December 6, 1866, one
Ga ston d'Artois was charged before Com
missioner Sullivan with the crime of
Eiracy on the high seas. The evidence
rougbt out at the hearing involved the
good name of Maximilian, the self-pro
claimed Emperor of Mexico, and General
Janrez, who made such a bitter and suc
cesslul fight for a republican form of gov
ernment.
It seems that in the month of October
1866, the brig Basco, flying the flag of
Maximilian, the so-called Emperor of
Mexico, set sail from La Paz for San Fran
cisco on the 18th of tne month named.
She made Cape San Lucas, 150 miles dis
tant, on the 23a, when the captain thought
it prudent to secure a fresh supply of
water. He accordingly stopped his vessel
250 feet off the shore.
Bhortly after anchoring, according to the
findings of Commissioner Sullivan, a boat
containing three armed men came from
the shore to the brig. This boat was com
manded by Gaston d'Artois. Later five
other men came from the shore, and at a
given signal three others put off from the
sloop Jenny, an American vessel lying
near the Basco.
D'Artois, by force or otherwise, secured
the sum of $2800 from the Basco. said to
be the property of one Paul Rothes. In
addition to this a box addressed to Wells,
Fargo <fc Co. was confiscated and taken to
the shore, but later returned as it con
tained only specimens.
The brig was released on a bond of $10,
-000, given by the captain and payable in
San Francisco. The authority on which
the seizure was made was contained in an
instrument given Gaston d'Artois by one
Ramon Carona, a general under the
Juarez or Republican Government of
Mexico, then in command of three States
bordering on the Pacific. D'Artois was
given authority to seize all vessels under
the French flag or the flag of Maximilian.
Commissioner Sullivan held, first, that
D'Artois was an American citizen, ana
further, that he was not a pirate, because
he had refused to take several thousand
dollars on board the Basco belonging to
parties other than Frenchmen. In" addi
tion to this, there were two parties in
power in Mexico at the time â one under
Maximilian and the other headed by
Juarez, whom the Federal Government
recognized. In view of this D'Artois was
set free.
The capture of D'Artois was a thing of
easy moment. After holding up the Basco
at La Paz and securing the booty named,
he boarded a vessel bound for San Fran
cisco, reaching this port a day or two after
the Basco. He was arrested, tried and
released, as above stated.
D'Artois returned to Mexico for a few
months, but later concluded to make his
home in San Francisco. He became a
traveling salesman for an Eastern cloth
ing-house, and for a time prospered. In
1886 he seemed to grow despondent, and on
October 30 of that year committed suicide
at 207 Montgomery avenue. The son, the
same presumably who is now suing for
criminal libel, testified that his father was
temporarily insane.
The net immigration to the Argentine
Republic for 1895 was 46,783 persons; in
1894, 64,720, and in 1893, 52,007. For the
last five years the total has been 220,000 ar
rivals. The great majority of the immi
grants continue to come from Italy. For
the last year Italian immigration was 65
per cent of the whole, and 18,912 were fam
ilies.

POPPIES THEIR EMBLEM
Endeavorers to Send an Esch
scholtzia Delegation to
San Jose.
Will Try to Secure the International
Convention for 1897 for
California.
"Hurrah for San Jose!"
This expression, in an excited and en
thusiastic tone, came from one of the
members, of the executive committee of
Golden Gate Union of Christian En
deavor.
The union met last night in the Young
Men's Christian Association building to
transact the routine business of the En
deavorers, and especially to consider the
State Convention to be held at San Jose
from May 14 to 17, inclusive. The fore
going enthusiastic expression was drawn
forth from an impulsive member during
an animated discussion.
The various committees report that
arrangements have been made to have
all the trains meet at Niles station and go
into San Jose in one train of twenty cars.
Provision has already been made for
boarding and lodging 1000 delegates in the
Garden City, and a couple of hundred of
these, representing fifty-three societies,
will go from San Francisco.
The poppy was formally adopted as the
emblem of Golden Gate Union. All the
San Francisco Endeavorers going to the
convention will wear this flower.
Even the hotel secured for the San Fran
cisco delegation, and the cars that draw
them into San Jose, will^be festooned with
eschscholtzias.
A beautiful silken banner has been pre
pared, on which is an artistic painting of
the Golden State. A wreath of golden
poppies will be hung on this, and it will
be carried in the ranks of this City's dele
gation.
Mrs. M. L. Berry, who is one of the most
enthusiastic members of the union, said :
"We are going to San Jose in a blaze of
glory, prepared to make a hard fight to
secure tbe International Convention of
Endeavorers of 1897 for California, and we
are convinced that we stand a fair show."
