COLD HAS CARRIED THE DAY
Illinois Swings the Middle Western
States Into the Yellow
Metal Line.
ADOPTION OF EASTERN FINANCIAL POLICY
CONCEDED BY THE LEADERS.
Advanced Silver Men Talk of Bolting After Their
Minority Report Is Read in the Convention
by the Committee on Resolutions.
UNITED PRESS HEADQUARTERS, t
SOUTHERN HOTEL, ST. LOUIS, Mo.,
June 15.â Gold has carried the day. This |
assertion, made through the United Press j
by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge at an early
hour this afternoon, put a new phase on
the financial situation and overturned
several of the plans which bad been
formed by those who had expected a j
different result. Mr. Lodge figured that I
twenty-two out of the forty-five States
now forming the Union had each selected
a member of the committee on resolutions j
favorable to the gold standard, and that
two or three Western States were likely to
follow suit, thus insuring a clear majority.
The Ohio men somewhat reluctantly rec- :
ognized that Mr. Lodge was speaking by ;
the card. George A. Robertson, e.litor of I
the Cleveland (O.) Recorder, who has made J
a specialty of fashioning the views of the
Ohio headers on this matter, saw ex-Secre
tary Foster and asked him if he did not
know that the people all through North
ern Ohio were for silver. He replied:
"The people of Ohio are Republicans and
will stand by sound Republican doctrines.
Free silver is a heresy and they do not
want it."
General C. A. Grosvenor, who is re
garded as almost the mouthpiece of Mc-
Kinley. said: "The platform will be all
right. There will be no occasion for the
East to complain on that score. It will be
discussed a good deal more, but it is really
settled just the same that the declaration
will be for gold."
Even Mark Hanna could not 'dispute the
fact that the gold-standard plank was in
tiie ascendant. It is somewhat singular
that Illinois, which turned the scale in
fovor of McKinley by instructing for him
instead of for Cullom, took a leading part
in shaping the course of the Middle West
ern States to-day by adopting a gold plank,
by the decisive vote of 42 to 6.
The action of the Idaho State delegation
may perhaps be significant of an intent to
bolt. It selected all the usual officers ap
pointed by State delegations, except some
one to wait upon the nominee for President
and Vice-President. Beyond this, and the
exceedingly soft money plank adopted by
the lowa delegation, which voted that
gold, silver and paper be kept on a parity
by the enactment of laws to accomplish it,
there were no very significant financial
features in the meetings of the State dele
gations which have occupied so much of
the day.
In the selection of the National Com
mitteemen for next year many men of
National repute were turned dewu. Wil
liam A. Hahn, so long a potent factor in
Ohio politics, disappears from the list, as
does also the equally well-known General
James S. Clarkson of lowa, and ex-Presi
dent Harrison's friend, J. N. Huston of
Indiana. Chauncey I. Filley of Missouri
sustained another defeat at the hands of
his old opponent, Mr. Kerens, and Colonel
William Lamb, chairman of the Republi
can State Committee of Virginia, was com
pelled to retire from the National Com
mittee in favor of a gentleman holding
different views. The case of Joseph H.
Manley of Maine is still held under ad
visement by his delegation, with an inti
mation that they will probably consider
his recent offense in giving up the Reed
ship as one of tt c head rather than of the
heart and will continue in his committee
membership.
To-day's proceedings seem not only to
have settled the financial plank, but also
the tariff plank of the next National Re
publican platform. A sketch of the pro
posed tariff revision, which it is said was
either drawn up by Major McKinley him
self or was submitted to him tor approval,
proposes an increase of duties all along
the line sufficient for the needs of the
treasury and the reim position of protec
tive duties on wool and sugar.
The first four paragraphs of the plat
form are devoted to a denunciation of the
Democratic policy, to which is ascribed
ihe commercial and industrial depression
that has prevailed during the past three
years and a laudation of the Republican
policy of protection, which had prevailed
for thirty years previously. There is a
strong recommendation for the renewal of
reciprocity agreements. There is also a
recommendation lor the imposition of 10
per cent duty on imports in foreign bot
toms, as foreshadowed in Governor For
afcer's statement published this morning.
The language of the platform is de
scribed as forceful, alliterative and full of
catchy phrases, such as are calculated to
brine down the house. All the talk among
the advanced silver men to-night is of
bolting after their minority free-silver re
port from the committee on resolutions is
voted down, as, of course, it will be.
GOLD MEN GAINING.
Their Strength Increasing Among
Northwestern Dele
gates.
ST. LOUIB, Mo., June 15.â The gold
men are steadily increasing their strength
among the Northwestern delegations,
which were supposed to be favorable to a
bimetallic standard.
Proof of this was shown to-night in a
linancial plank which was drafted by
Governor Merriam of Minnesota and sub
mitted to Mr. Platt of New York as em
bodying the views of the Western McKin
iey men.
This plank is identical with the resolu
tion adopted by the New York delegation
to-day, which declares for the main
tenance of the present gold standard and
The San Francisco Call.
condemns the free coinage af silver ex
cept by international agreement.
It contained an additional provision,
however, that the silver now in circula
tion shall be maintained at a parity with
gold. This is understood to have been in
serted with a view to satisfying the friends
of silver that no attempt will be made, in
the event of Republican success next No
vember, to degrade silver.
Mr. Platt sent for Senator Lodge of
Massachusetts and Messrs. Quigg and
Lauterbach of New York, and other gen
tlemen during the course of the evening,
and consulted with them regarding Gov
ernor Merriam's proposition.
There was a unanimity of expression
among those who were consulted that the
parity clause should be eliminated, and
this being done it was returned to Gover
nor Merriam for his approval.
The above picture is reproduced from a sketch made for "The Call" by J. Kahler on Wednesday evening last on the occasion of the dedication of the big hall. There
were 15,000 persons gathered on the occasion. The view will give an excellent idea of the appearance of the hall when the convention is opened to-day. By consulting the
ground plan printed on the second page of ** The Call" this morning the reader will be able to understand the interior arrangements and how the great space is divided.
The Ohio managers of Mr. McKinley
deny all knowledge of Governor Merriam's
plank, and say that it is but one of many
tentative propositions which have been
advanced and which must be referred to
the committee on resolutions.
They themselves have acquainted Gov
ernor Foraker with their wishes ana he
will be prepared to represent them when
the committee meets. It is an open
secret at Ohio headquarters that
they do not wish the word "gold"
to appear so prominently in the platform
as has been suggested in some quarters.
They will agree to a declaration that the
money of the country shall be as sound as
gold, or some similar expression, but they
are ill-disposed to make the statement
broader.
There is a manifest purpose on the part
of the anti-McKinley men to delay the
nominations as long as possible. It is
whispered about the Southern Hotel
at midnight that some of these
gentlemen entertain the hope that
by prolonging the contest a belter oppor
tunity will be afforded of presenting a
stronger front to the McKinley forces.
One of Mr. Plan's lieutenants
at midnight informed a United ' Press
reporter that they would stubborn
ly oppose the formation of the committee
on resolutions until the committee on cre
dentials had made its report and it had
been acted upon by the convention.
Their contention is that until
the convention has ta*en cognizance
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, JUNE 16, 1896.â
of the contests it would be manifestly im
proper to construct the committee on reso
lutions. Their programme is to devote
the first day's session to the temporary or
ganization and the formation of the creden
tials committee.
The second day they desire the conven
tion shall consider the committee's report,
and when this has been done an adjourn
ment is to be taken in order that the third
day may be devoted to the platform, thus
carrying the nominations over until Fri
day.
The McKinley men say in answer to
this that representing a large majority of
the convention they will cut out the work
to suit themselves without submitting to
the dictation of the minority.
SENATOR ALLISON TALKS.
Confident That His Party Will
Adopt a Cold Standard.
CHICAGO, 111., June 15.â Senator Alli
son passed through the city yesterday on
his way from Washington to Dubuque.
He was averse to discussing the political
situation, and especially his own candi
dacy, as well as the probable nominee of
the St. Louis convention, and dismissed
the latter subject by saying the nominee,
whoever he might be, would unquestion
ably be elected.
He talked freely, however, concerning
the probable financial plank of the plat
form, and expressed the opinion that it
would be a clear-cut declaration for the
maintenance of the present gold standard.
He said it was practically assured that the
Democratic party would come out for the
free coinage of silver at 16 to 1, and noth
ing remained for the Republican party to
do but to take a bold, unequivocal stand
in opposition to it and in favor of the
maintenance of the present standard.
The Republican party, he said, was not
an enemy of silver, but had always stood
for as extended use of it as was consistent
with a maintenance of the parity between
the two metals. Under its rule, he said,
silver had attained to an extensive use,
and the Republican party favored tnis use
so long as it did not seem to be a menace
to the existing standard.
" Free coinage at 16 to 1, however, with-
THE CONVENTION AUDITORIUM IN ST. LOUIS.
out an international agreement," he said,
" simply means silver monometallism,
and the Republican party will never con
sent to be a party to such a crime against
the financial and industrial forces of the
country. The great business interests
of the country, to which it has always
been an unswerving friend, looks confi
dently to it now to take its stand un
equivocally for the maintenance of an
honest dollar, and it would be false to its
glorious record if it failed, in however so
slight a degree, to fully meet these ex
pectations-
"There can be no doubt, either, as to
how the masses of the Republican party
feel on this question. They feel that the
party is facing another great crisis in its
history, and tney are eager to see it and
face it with the same fearlessness with
which it has faced the many momentous
problems of the past. I have no fears my
self, therefore, as to what the St. Louis
convention will do, and 1 believe its action
will meet with the indorsement of the
great business interests of the country in
dependent of party affiliations.
"The convention will probably declare
for a tariff which will afford the Govern
ment sufficient revenue to meet its ex
penses as well as afford adequate protec
tion to American industries. It will, also,
undoubtedly declare for reciprocity, which
was productive of such beneficent results
to the commercial and manufacturing in
terests of the country. On these lines, I
think, the Republican party will march
forward to a glorious victory in the com
ing campaign."
Congressman "Bob" CouÃins of lowa,
who attained National fame through his
recent speech on Minister Bayard, passed
through the city yesterday afternoon, on
his way from Washington to St. Louis.
He said lowa was still loyal to Senator
Allison, but admitted with a smile that it
looked very much like McKinley. He
thought there was little doubt that the
convention would declare clearly against
free silver.
Congressman S. M. Stephenson of Mich
igan was here, en route to St. Louis. He
does not fear that a gold platform will
cause the loss of Michigan to the Republi
cans. He is confident that any defections
will be more than made up by Democratic
votes.
TALKED TO MERCHANTS.
Chauncey M. Depew Addressed
Many Business Men.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 15.â Chauncey
M. Depew this afternoon addressed 3500
merchants of St. Louis on the financial
question. Every reference to the main
tenance of the gold standard was received
with hearty applause. To-night Mr. De
pew addressed a meeting held at the
Auditorium under the auspices of the
Grand Army of the Republic for the bene
fit of the Missouri Soldiers' Home. It was
an enthusiastic audience and estimated at
nearly 10,000. His address was mainly in
eulogy of the G. A. R.
HAS SQUARED HIMSELF.
Manley Will Not Be Disciplined by
Maine Delegates.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 15.â The feeling
of resentment against Joseph Manley,
which was intense among the Maine dele
gation when they arrived yesterday, has
perceptibly decreased.
Mr. Manley met the issue with charac-
I teristic frankness. He told his Maine
i friends that he had mace a mistake.
"It was not a crime," he said, "it was a
blunder."
He then explained the spirit in which
his published statement that McKinley
was likely to be nominated was written.
After its publication he saw now easily
it could be misinterpreted, but it waa then
too late to correct the error. The leading
members of the delegation discussed the
matter informally after their conference
with Mr. Manley, and his explanation of
the incident was fully accepted by them.
To-day few if any of the delegation will
admit that Mr. Manlay was influenced by
improper motives, although there are not
wanting those who feel that in some way
Mr. Manley should be "disciplined."
These, however, are in the minorily.
The majority believe that Mr. Manley
has been sufficiently punished, and they
are not disposed to degrade him in the
eyes of his friends by asking his with
drawal from the National Committee, for
which place he was informally agreed
upon a fortnight ago. The indications are
that the incident will be passed over with
out action or further comment.
CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE.
An Impartial Hearing to Be Given
All Contestants.
ST. LOUIS, Mo.. June 15.^The plan to
avoid a hearing of contests in the commit
tee on credentials by adopting as a whole
the temporary roll adopted by the Na
tional Committee is not likely to succeed.
A number of the members of the cre
dentials committee said to-uieht that they
were in favor of giving a limited but im
partial hearing to such of those unseated
by the National Committee as desired to
make a presentation of their cases.
Some of the minor Texas and Missis
sippi contests will not be pushed, but the
Mississippi, New York and Delaware
cases will, it is expected, occupy so much
time that it will be impossible lor the com
mittee to make its report before Wednes
day night at the earliest The effort to
bring about a caucus of all contestants
failed of success, the Delaware and New
York people deciding that nothing waa to
be gained by it.
WILL NOT COMPROMISE.
Higgins and Addlck Forces Will
Not Affiliate.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 15.â Reports of a
compromise between the Higgins and Ad
dick forces in Delaware are aenied em
phatically by the Higgins men, who say
they are either entitled to complete rep
resentation or to nothing, and will accept
no half-way measures.

MAGUIRE COMING HOME.
The Judge Is Highly Pleased With the Posi-
tion of the Railroad Funding
Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 15.â Judge
Maguire left to-night for San Francisco.
Speaking of the funding bill, he said it was
in the best possible position for which the
people of California could have hoped.
"It is tied up in the House, with a very
strong sentiment against it, and in the
Senate it is in a position where a deter
mined filibuster can certainly defeat it
during the short session.
"It was beaten by persistent opposition
upon all possible grounds and by the pow
erful showing made by The Call and
other papers and of the universal senti
ment against it on the Pacific Coast. Our
fight hasbeen from the beginning against
taking any action in Congress on theques
tion, holding that the present law is suf
ficient for foreclosure.
"The Huntington people "have been very
anxious to have us admit that some legis
lation is necessary and upon this admis
sion to go before Congress and try conclu
sions against their powerful and secret
influences. In my opinion the failure of
the funding bill to get consideration in the
first session makes its defeat certain so far
as this Congress is concerned."
SILVER MEN WILL NOT BOLT
Though They Foresee Defeat They
Will Remain in the Conven=
tion to the End.
FREE COINAGE WILL BE INSISTED ON AND
NO COMPROMISE ACCEPTED.
Senator Teller Says McKinley Cannot Carry a
Single Silver State in the West on a Plat
form That Declares for Gold.
UNITED PRESS HEADQUARTERS,
SOUTHERN HOTEL, ST. LOUIS, Mo.,
June 15. â There will be no dramatic exit
from the National Convention nor will
there be held any separate convention by
the free-silver Republicans. The Western
men foresee defeat and will accept it as
philosophically as possible, althoueh not
without vigorous protests, both here and
at home.
No. formal conference of that faction of
the party was held to-day, but Mr. Teller,
wherever he has happened to be, has been
a magnet that attracted every silver man
in St. Louis. The private talks he has had
with those who helieve with him have
convinced him that the silver tlement of
the party is in deadly earnest and will not
accept anything short of a clear-cut and
unequivocal declaration for the free and
unlimited coinage of silver at the ratio of
16 to 1-
"The managers of Major McKinley's
campaign are conducting themselves in a
fashion that, to speak mildly, is foolish,"
said Senator Teller this evening. "Do
they think that the voters of the silver
States are to be misled by any catchpenny
phrase they may insert in the platform?
To believe thus is an insult to the integ
rity of the people of the We?t.
"It matters nothing to us whether the
word 'gold' appears in the platform or
whether the effort is made to slide under
the terms 'existing standard.' Everybody
knows they mean the same thing and our
people would have infinitely more respect
for the Republican party if it came out
plainly for gold instead of foisting upon
them a miseraDle straddle. We have re
spect for those who are opposed to us and
who boldly assume their position. But
with parties, as with men, respect disap
pears and we have nothing but contempt
for those who have not the courage of
their coovictions."
Mr. Teller has called a caucus of the
free silver members of the committee on
resolutions for to-morrow evening. He
recognizes the fact that the silver men are
in a hopeless minority, but they will go
over the ground as carefully as though
they controlled the situation. Knowing
they are to meet defeat, plans for the
future will doubtless be discussed.
When it comes to a meeting of the com
mittee a Diauk ueciarinc for free coinage.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
as interpreted by Mr. Teller, win be sub
mitted by him. This, of course, will be
voted down. A compromise will then be
offered in 'the shape of a proposition to
coin the American product only.
This, too, will meet the fate of the more
advanced proposition. It is not improba
ble that a third proposition promising fu
ture legislation favorable to silver will be
submitted, the silver men not abandoning
hope until every offer has been rejected.
The fight will then be carried into the
convention. Possibly these same proposi
tions may be submitted there; they cer
tainly will be if the chairman of the con
vention will entertain the motion. If the
financial plank becomes a subject for
debate, as it is believed it will, Sena
tor Teller, Senator Dubois, Congressman
Hartman and several other of the silver
leaders will make brief speeches outlining
their position and warning the convention
that any plank, however it may be
worded, other than a free coinage declara
tion will cause the defeat of the ticket in
every silver State in the West.
It is understood that while Mr. Teller's
speech will be earnest to the point of in
tense vehemence, he will not then and
there bolt the convention and leave under
the dramatic circumstances that have
sometimes been pictured.
His speech, however, will represent the
views of every silver delegate to this con
vention, and it is possible, even probable,
that the silver men will refrain from fur
ther participation in the business of the
convention.
The most prominent of the silver leaders
is to-night authority for the statement that
no convention or meeting separate from
the National Convention will be called on
benalf of the disappointed silver Republi
cans. What may be done, however, in the
future, is still undetermined.
The action of the convention in denying
the demands of the silver men will not be
permitted to go without official protest.
A declaration is to be prepared betting
forth the views of the silver men
and warning the country of the sure dis
aster to follow the adoption of the plat
form agreed upon the election of a Presi
dent plegded to either a gold standard or
the present order of things. The rough
draft of this manifesto was the subject of
several conferences to-night.
TRAFFIC IN SEATS.
Scalpers Place Tickets on Sale at
Fancy Prices.
CHICAGO, 111., Jane 15.â A special
from St. Louis, Mo., says: It having been
announced that Sereeant-at-arms Byrnes
would distribute the tickets for the con
vention Monday night his rooms yester
day and to-day were crowded with men
who thought their influence was at least
sufficient to secure an ent-ance to the hall
for themselves and possibly a friend or
two. After about 500 such individuals had
visited Mr. Byrnes he had made a distinct
reputation for "cold-bloodedness."
All the extra tickets have been secured
by the men who are in control of the con
vention and the nomination bids fair to be
made in, the presence of a large gathering
of "'original" McKinley men. There are
11,000 and more seats in the convention
and the McKinley managers discovered
that the local committee was making away
with these in a hurry, so they took tiie
matter out of its haniis. Then it was that
the taking care of the original McKinley
men began.
Sergeant-at-Arms Byrnes figured closely
when he allotted the tickets for the con
vention. He has just enough seats in each
State delegation for the delegates and the
exact number for the alternates in the
sections reserved for tnem. The National
Committee, in deciding the contests, has
given to several contesting delegations
half a vote apiece.
The sergeant-at-arms had a force of
men enter the convention hall to-day to
rearrange the chairs so that the half-vote
men could oe accommodated.
Mr. Byrnes so arranged that the mem
bers of the National Commutes would have
to take the brunt of the importunity of
the ticket-seekers. He made the allot
ment of each State up in a package, and
this was given to the National Committee
men; then they received requests and
made enemies.
There are a good many tickets to the con
vention already being offered for sale
around the city. The scalpers explain to
their applicants that while the ticketa
have not yet been distributed they have
positive assurance that they will be able
to meet all orders. Some of the choicest
seats in the convention hall are being
placed on the market. The Business
Men's League, which built the convention
hall, secured 3000 tickets from the Na
tional committeemen. These have all been
placed on the market at the unilorm price
of $40 apiece. Each of the delegates has â 
been given three tickets and each alternate
two. Some of these have already begun
cutting prices with the Business Men's
League. They are offering admission to
one day of the convention for $20. The
brokers are^ doing a rushing business, al
though the crowds have only begun to
come in earnest.
"We have for sale no regular delegate
seats," said a ticket-broker. "I can give
you alternate coupons for one, two or three
admissions for $20 a day. That is, you
must buy the three sessions. You can have
a seat in the session devoted to alternates
dor $20. If there is only one session on
that day that you want to attend you can
bring the remaining two coupons to us
and we will see what can be done. If we
sell them quick, all right."2
GROUND PLAN OF THE CONVENTION AUDITORIUM.
The accompanying diagram will enable the readers of The Call, when compared with the large picture on the preceding page,
to thoroughly understand the interior arrangements of the Convention Hall. The delegations will be seated in the order follow

.St. Lotus, Mo., June 15. )
The old Mississippi River was simmering
in the pouring rain when the train bearing
the California delegates pulled into the
union depot at half-past 9 this morning.
A large crowd had assembled for the
purpose of seeing the boys from California,
and the Grand Army band of Canton, Ohio,
numbering sixty pieces, was there to re
ceive them, by special request of* Marcus
Aurelius Hanna.
This band is a combination of brass and
reed instruments and is one of the finest
musical organizations in the United States
As the train rolled in the band played
"Annie Laurie" in quick time and the
HENRY CLAY EVANS OF TENNESSEE.
Mr. Evans is one ofVthe Vice-Presidential possibilities. Although
an Illinoisan by birth, in manner, bearing and conversation, he is
quite Southern in appearance. lie is a little above medium height, of
dark complexion, of slender build, and his face is adorned with a mus
tache and a goatee. His carriage is erect and dignified, while he is
affable even to cordiality in manners, and a brilliant and witty con
versationalist. It is said by his friends that if Mr. Evans fails of a
nomination for Vice-President he would be willing to accept the posi
tion of Postmaster-General in President McKinley's Cabinet.
! clarinets squeaked and squawked up and
down the chromatic scale, to tha great
delight of the crowd.
As the delegates disembarked they were
â¢ cheered agaia and again and were bidden
, a right royal welcome to the convention j
city. Then they formed in twos and, shel
tered by umbrellas from the pelting rain,
inarched up Olive street to Broadway and !
down Broadway to the Southern Hotel.
The soul-stirring music of the big band j
i drew a great concourse to the sidewalks on
Broadwa}', and the Caiifornians marching !
, bravely in the mud were cheered at every |
1 step. Flags and streamers fluttered- from
the tall buildings on each side, giving the
street a holiday appearance.
When the parade arrived opposite the
: courthouse, Count Hacquette, who has a
j brother in the liquor business in San Fran
| Cisco, ran into the street, hat in hand, re- I
j garaless of the rain and shouted : "Hurray \
for California."
The cheers were given with a will by the |
crowd.
There was so great a jam in front of the
hotel entrance that it was with difficulty
that the band was able to force Its way
into the building, but when it got inside,
; still continuing to play "How Annie Lau
j rie gave McKinley her promise true,"
there was a burst of cheering.
The grand staircase was cleared by the
j police and the delegation marched into
the California headquarters, where they !
; received the congratulations of friends, i
Among those waiting to welcome them j
were U. S. Grant of San Diego, Congress- |

The delegation had a pleasant trip on
the way out, so pleasant indeed that some
of the members did not sleep more than
sixteen hours out of the ninety-nine con
sumed in the journey
To-day the finishing touches were put
6n the street decorations, and St. Louis
smiles in ribbons and flags.
It is difficult to make one's way along
the sidewalks so thick -are masses of
people coming in from the outer edge
oi town, ten or twelve miles away, in tne
streetcars to watch the clubs march and to
hear the Lands play. There are at least a
dozen fakers on every block along the line
of Broadway offering badges for sale.
Nearly all of these are for McKinley.
Everything seems to be McKinley before
the convention meets. There are McKin
ley walking sticks with the head of the
Ohio man done in American tin on the
handle, and McKinley hats and McKinley
buttons and McKinley newspapers for
sale very cheap.
The hotels are crowded to suffocation,
and the requirements of the pure-air law,
if there be any such law in St. Louis, are
being flagrantly disregarded. Four cots
in one small room will give some idea of
the situation in the first-class hotels, but
notwithstanding the discomfort the
charges are as high as though there were
four rooms to each cot.
Out in the cheap lodging-houses which
were glad to get 25 and 50 cents per night
for a room, with samples from Noah's Ark
thrown in, have placed in each room as
many cots as it will hold and are charging
$2 per night for each person.
The overcrowding has played havoc with
the Southern ard the Planter's Hotel.
Before the mob came they were elegantly
furnished.
The warm air circulating through their
spacious lobbies was at least pure and
breathable. If one does not pay too much
attention to the columns and the heroic
size bronze figures of the savage North
men guarding the grand staircase he
might easily believe himself to be in a
crowded cellar in San Francisco's China
town.
The sight is obscured and the eyes irri
tated with dust and tobacco smoke. Black
dust lies half an inch deep on the can
vassed floor with tobacco expectorations,
stumps of cigars and other foul litter.
In the crowded lobbies the air Is so
thick and poisoned that it fe*els like a re
freshing plunge into the Mississippi to
step out upon the sidewalk into the full
influence of this hammam bath climate.
The effect of this unnatural environ
ment is very trying UDon delegates and
others who have been here for several
days. They have stood in the lobbies
until 2 and 3 o'clock in the morn-
ing wagging their jaws and emit
ting therefrom articulate sounds, the
monotony being varied now and then by
a shout of "hoorah for McKinley!" until a
person really begins to grow very weary of
so much McKinley. It's McKinley for
breakfast, for lunch, for dinner, and Mc-
Kinley for supper at 2 o'clock in the morn
ing.
Even then you are not nd of McKinley,
for he goes to bed with you and wakes you
in the morning before you have had your
beauty sleep, to go out and wag your chin
for him. 1 have heard so much of the gen
tleman, with whom I have not the
honor of being acquainted, that I felt
really refreshed this afternoon when I
strolled into the New York headquarters
after the caucus and saw delegates put
ting on Morton button badges. For
a similar reason I was well pleased
to behold the enthusiasm of the
Maine contingent for Thomas B.
Reed, when they put an immense
oil portrait of him on the balcony of the
Southern, and at night blazed the letters
of his name in incandescent lights. Also,
I am pleased when I catch a glimpse of a
badge bearing the strong intellectual pro
file of Mr. Allison.
Senator Lexow ol New York is
heTe. He is the man whose name j
two years ago rang through every State,
in every village and town and along every
county road in the Jnited States as the
peerless exposer of political corruption in
New York City.
Contrary to the natural expectation he
is not a man of tall stature. We are ac
customed to associate great size wiih
great deeds, and this because of the
hereditary instinct from our savage an
cestors, whose great deads were battles
and contests of physical prowess, and the
winners of which contests were neces
sarily large and powerful men.
So when you-stumble over a small man
who has jJchieved greatness in politics,
and especially a conqueror of the strongly
intrenched hosts of corruption, and
against an organization so mighty as Tam
many Hall, you are likely to pass him by
without further notice, except to curse
him, if you are profane, for being the cause
of your stubbing your toe against his
pigmy personality.
Senator Lexow is about the medium
height or rather a little under it. He can
not weigh more than 125 pounds and his
narrow, stooping shoulders and thin neck
make him appear even lighter. The flat,
straight-brimmed hat so much in vogue
among the delegates does not impart any
dignity to his appearance.
His nose is small and straight, neither
aquiline nor retrousse; his ears are small
and symmetrical, his eyes blue and
his closely trimmed beard and mustache
are dark brown. Back of his ears
the silver lining of his forty-four years
of life has made its appearance and
there is no doubt that the terrible strain
and weight of tie responsibility of politi
cal upheavel, of which he was the head
and front, have darkened the brightness
of his prime.
That which struck me most forcibly was
the coolness and steadiness of nerve of the
man.
His eye is as clear as that of a marksman
on the prairies and his voice is low and
even. Such a man, I think, would stand
in front of a foe and return shot for shot
until he dropped in his tracks.
He answered the first question I asked
him as quietly as though he had been fore
warned of it.
"Speaking generally, what would you
suggest," I began, "to remedy corruption
in politics?"
"A higher degree of citizenship," was
the reply, ''a broader and more liberal
education."
This was putting reform many years in
the future. The Senator meant it, how
ever, for he went on: "The rule is true
that in the best educated districts, where
intelligence is highest and the appreciation
of education is greatest, there will be the
least corruption."
The Senator takes issue with Herbert
Spencer on this point, but he spoke from
his American experience. "Also in those
communities," continued the Senator,
"where wealth is more evenly divided a
higher standard of citizenship is observed.
"It has been said that the laws will be
sufficient, but you are not going to reduce
corruption by legal processes or by enact
ing laws. The only effective way in which
it can be done is by raising the civic pride
of the individual, and this by liberalizing
the education of the citizens."
The speaker went on to say that possi- j
bly the result of stringent legislation, |
which might diminish corruption so far as
one's own State was concerned, and the
safeguard which had been thrown around
the machinery of elections, would mitigate
any attempts to debase or debauch the
franchise very materially. S
"It was well understood," continued j
Senator Lexow, "before the day on which
the investigation was initiated, that cor
ruption ruled in more than one depart
ment of the city police system, but so long
as it remained unproved as a fact, people
doubted that there was a system in the
methods of corruption and abuse that ex
isted.
*'lt was not long before the revelations
which were made before the committee j
demonstrated that a perfect system hail
been established, permeating the police
department from the lowest to the highest, I
and the establishment of that as a fact
produced the political revolution that oc
curred a few years ago.
"Whatever else may have been the re
sult of that investigation, it is quite cer
tain that for a number of years a general
system of corruption will not prevail, and
it is very doubtful whether any perfect
system such as that which we found in
New York will ever again be organized."
In reply to questions as to the seeming
reaction which restored the Tammany
power the Senator explained that it was
largely due to the importation into the
campaign of the liquor issue.
Under the plea of personal liberty, the
cosmopolitan city of New York was stirred
to its depths and responded, but not in
any sense to the extent that bad been ex
pected by Tammany Hall or the Demo
cratic organization.
"It was a close fight at best," continued
the Senator, "for although the normal
Democratic majority was between 45,000

WARNER MILLER'S HOT
ATTACK.
McKinley's Fitness for the Ofice
of President Is Dis
cussed.
JOHN KAINES MAKES A WARM
RETORT.
Thurlow Weed Barnes Siys Miller
Came Into the Delegation With
a Knife.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 15.â There was a
wholesale washing of resolution soiled
linen at the meeting of the New Â¥ork
delegation this afternoon. It began -with
a passage at arms between Chairman Lau
terbach and Anson G. McCook and was
followed by a sensational attack by
Warner Miller on ex-Senator Platt. Still
more sensational were the utterances of
Thurlow Weed Barnes and John Raines,
who unitedly spoke for Mr. Platt and who
pictured Mr. Miller as sneaking into the
delegation with a knife in his sleeve, and
as being, faithful in nothing and faithless
in everything. After this lively discharge
of personalities the delegation settled
down to business and named their repre
sentatives for the several convention com
mittees. Before adjourning a resolution
was unanimously adopted, favoring the
maintenance of the present gold standard
and opposing free silver except by inter
national agreement.
Cbauncey M. Depew rapped the meet
ing to order with a heavy walking-stick in
lieu of the customary gavel. William A.
Sutherland, the New York member of the
National Committee, won the thanks
of the little coterie of newspaper men
present, by offering a resolution that they
be permitted to remain during the session.
It was unanimously adopted.
The striking incidents which followed
were precipitated by Mr. Lauterbach,
who in a brief speech declared that while
the contestants who were seated by the
National Committee on Saturday last
should be permitted to remain in the hall
and vote, it should not be construed as an
indorsement by the delegation of the Na
tional Committee's action, but, on the
contrary, they should be regarded merely
as temporary delegates.
This brought Ansoh G. McCook to his
feet. Mr. Cook was manifestly opposed to
the patronizing tone in which Mr. Lauter
bach referred to the late contesting dele
gates. He said he had fought this battle
in the primaries and finally before the Na
tional Committee. Mr. Sutherland him
self made the motion that be and Mr.
Brookfield were entitled to their seats. If
the delegates wished to shut him out of
the convention, he would bow to their
will. He did not come here as a suppli
cant for his rights, but as a Republican
who had voted for every President from
Lincoln down to the present time. He
did not come in a factional spirit. Turn
ing to Mr. Lauterbach he passionately ex
claimed that he would accept nothing
from that gentleman but courtesy. He
aiked for nothing but what was right.
When Mr. McCook had finished, Mr.
Depew restored good temper by a humor
ous allusion to the proceeding of this
morning, and in this connection made a
personal explanation. He stated that he
was in bis his room preparing a speech,
which he proposed deliverine; to the
merchants of St. Louis, when Mr. Lauter
bach burst in with the announcement that
he (D^pew) had been selected as chair
man of the meeting. He supposed that
there had been a conference of the dele
gates and that the matter bad been settled
by them. When he arrived at the hall he
explained to Mr. Miller that his time was
limited and requested that the business be
expedited as rapidly as possible. He re
viewed the incidents of the morning meet
ing and asserted that he was interesied in
advancing Governor Morton's claims for
the Presidency. This assertion was greeted
with a loud cheer from the Platt men.
Owing to the differences in the delega
tions, however, 'he said he would not be a
candidate for the "post of chairman.
Then came the personalities. The pre
siding officer recognized Warner Miller,
who explained the circumstances under
which he had asked Mr. Depew to permit
the use of his name as a candidate for t!ie
chairmanship. He went on to say that
the question of personality was not in
volved in this matter. It made no differ
ence whether Depew, Platt or any one else
was selected- There were other consider
ations. Mr. Platt, whose name had been
proposed for the chairmanship, had de
scribed one of tha candidates for the
Presidency (McKinley) as unfit for the
office. He inquired dramatically if the
New York delegates indorsed that state
ment. If they did. they could make that
man their chairman. He would not con
sent that the New York delegation should
put any such stigma on Mr. McKinley
and if it were done, let them go home and
explain how they approved this infamous
characterization. He appealed to the
delegates to say whether they indorsed it.
How are these charges to be answered in
the campaign? he queried, turning on his
heel and, with a wave of his hand, in
cluding all those present. No man, he
asserted, could put him in such a position.
Why is it, he again asked, that Mr. Depew
is to be put down and the man who has
uttered these baseScharges, substituted?
Mr. Thurlow Weed Barnes replied for
Mr. Platt. He inquired sarcastically, who
was entitled to the greater honor, the man
who came out squarely and made his right,
or Mr. Miller who sneaked into the dele
gation with his knife in his sleeve. At
this point the Platt men arose and for a
minute or more applauded the speaker,
Mr. Miller meanwhile sitting calmly and
surveying the scene with a contemptuous
smile on his face. Mr. Barnes closed his
remarks with a declaration that he had no
apologies to make for supporting Mr.
Platt and that he personally did not fear
to meet the issue.
Mr. Depew at this point attempted to
soothe the ruffled feelings of the delegates
by announcing that the business before
the meeting was the election of a chair
man of the delegation. Ceneral Anson G.
McCook thereupon nominated Mr. Warner
Miller, while Mr. Platt was put in nomina
tion by Mr. Quigg. But the exchange of per
sonalities was not so easily closed. State
Senator John Raines had something to say
and he said it with a force and vigor and di
rectness of expression that caused the dele
gates to break into cheers of approval
again and again.
Turning to Mr. Miller and shaking his
finger almost in the latter's face Mr.
Raines characterized the ex-Senator as the
representative of the kickers of New York;
as a man who sought the place of delegate
at large to oppose Governor Morton. He
did not approve of Mr. Miller's course.
Mr. Miller might regard it as an exhibi
tion of courage. In his (Raines 1 ) opinion
it was an exhibition of downright fool
hardiness. Advancing a step toward Mr.
Miller, and addressing his remarks to that
gentleman, he inquired when it was that
Mr. Platt bad said that McKinley was
unfit and incomperent for the office of
President. He challenged the correctness
of the statement and asserted, while the
Platt men cheered him to the echo, that
Mr. Miiler nad misrepresented their
leader. What Mr. Platt did say was that
a gentleman who aspired to the Presidency
should announce bis position on the money
question. In one part of the country he
was quoted as holding certain views, and
in another part of the country he was
quoted as holding opposite views. What
Mr. Platt wanted was a correct definition
of Mr. McKinley's financial principles.
He charged Mr. Miller with being faith
less in everything and faithful in nothing,
and was again loudly cheered, when he
declared in conclusion that whoever might
be nominated, whether it were McKinley
or any other gentleman, he would have
the united support of all the loyal Repub
licans of New York, including, he hoped,
even Warner Miller of Herkimer. Mr.
Raines' remarks so cleared the atmosphere
and so satisfied Mr. Platt's friends that
they were willing at this point to vote on
the question of the delegation chairman
ship.
Mr. Miller apparently had nothing fur
ther to'say, and the clerk began to call the
roll. Mr. Depew was loudly cheered when
he arose and . announced his choice to
be Mr. Platt, and the latter's friends ex
pressed further manifestations of approval
when similar votes were cast by Thomas
J. Bradley, who some weeks ago an
nounced that he would support McKinley
for President, and by Dewitt C. Middleton.
Of the 70 votes cast Mr. Platt received 53
and Mr. Miller 17, and again the Platt men

Sacramento, Cal., June 15. )
Judge W. A. Ryan of Los Angeles is the
man of the hour in Sacramento. He is
put forward by his friends as the only
man who can beat Frank Gould for the
chairmanship of the convention. He may
not be able to reach the place, but he has
at least given a bad scare to the adherents
of Gould. When the Los Angeles dele
gates arrived to-day they hoisted a neatly
printed banner on which was emblazoned
the legend:
: Headquarters of the Los Angeles delegation. :
; In room 64. â¢
Hon. \V. A. Kf an for chairman.
Judge Ryan was himself not disposed to
press his candidacy, but his friends would
not listen to his attempts at declination.
Judge Taney of Los Angeles spoke for the
southern part of the State in urging Jud^e
Ryan's candidacy, saying:
"We of the Southland are for any man
who is impartial. We know that there are
certain contests within the party that have
caused much rancor. Mr. Gould may be a
good man, but having become a partisan
i-i these schisms, we do not consider that
he is properly qualified to act with entire
impartiality. On that account we present
our candidate and trust that he may re
ceive the he deserves. He
deserves the support of every good Demo
crat, no matter to what faction he be
longs."
Thus the argument is passed along, and
the friends of Ryan say tliat if they don't
win they will give Gould the worst scare of
his life.
It was apparently only a little unim
portant conversation that was taking
place in the barroom of the Golden Eagle
Hotel this evening between Frank Gould,
the avowed candidate for chairman of the
State convention, and Andrew J. Clunie,
one of the most enthusiastic and active
supporters of the anti-Junta delegation.
But had this little confab terminated
satisfactorily to Clunie the situation that
now exists would have been changed in
most important particulars and would
have left the convention proceedings to
sail along in the smoothest possible man
ner. Jt was a last effort to bring about
harmony without a precedine condition of
war, but it failed absolutely.
The sudden rise of Judge W. A. Ryan's
star to-day put Gould and his adherents
on their mettle, and they lost no oppor
tunity of cementing and increasing the
strength of their leaders. Conciliation
â was the word, and so tactful were their
efforts that they induced that hard-headed
and bold-hearted fighter from Alameda,
Hon. W. W. Foote. to surrender horse
and dragoons. Foote is now out for
Gould without equivocation and without
reserve.
Taking advantage of this conciliatory
spirit that pervaded the Gould camp,
Andy Clunie looked up Gould, found him
holding up the bar in the Golden Eagle,
called him to one side and then put this
proposition squarely before him
"We will withdraw all our opposition to
your candidacy for chairman of the con
vention if you will agree to submit to us
the names of the gentlemen whom you
propoe to name as members of the com
mittee on credentials."
Gould backed and filled a bit, but being
brought back to a direct answer he de
clined to comply with the request of the
anti-Junta people. From this on until
the question of chairmanship is decided
the lines will be drawn and the battle will
be waged with all the fierceness and
energy at the command of all concerned.
Evening brought the first Teal burst of
life and whoop and the first real tug-of
xvar. Ryan's boom, which started early
in the afternoon, ran a gentle and uncer
tain course until near dinner time, when
the first sensation occurred. W. W. Foote

made it when he declared himself for
Gould, and it became known that English
and Fitzgerald had got in with Foote on
the deal making Alameda solid for Gould.
Thit was a hard punch to the Ryan
boomers and Buckleyites, and signs of
alarm disappeared from the faces of the
Daggett-Gould-McNab hustlers. But still
everybody waited for the evening trains
and the re-en lorcements and the connubv-
ating of the night.
The whoop came at 8:30 o'clock, when
the San Francisco train rolled into the
depot, where the blare of a brass band and
a crowd of hundreds of people welcomed
the big crowd from the city.
The Iroquois clubs from San Francisco,
Benicia and Suisun poured out and
formed in iine with yip-yip-yip and much
hurrah. The Iroquois procession quickly
formed and up X street it went, with the
new Sacramento Iroquois Club and a band
for escort, and with tomahawks, Roman
candies and red-fire to help out the excite
ment.
Then the BucKleyites poured forth from
I train, too, in their strength. They came
150 strong, and they formed by twos be
; bind the Iroquois clubs, headed by Chair
| man Joseph Rothschild, Senator Donovan,
j J. C. Nealon, Henry Ach and other lead
ers. Each Buckley delegate wore a badge
;of ribbons and tin imitations of silver
| dollars, and the delegation marched
| proudly to its headquarters, near Seventh
, and X streets.
The Buckleyites found that the strag
gling Junta delegation had not come with
any outward show of force, and that they
liad no headquarters, and the, Buckley
force hurled itself en masse into the politi
cal gathering that overran the Golden
Eagle and the Capitol Hotel, across the
street, ana gave life to the sidewalks.
They made an impression by their num
bers and presence, and they knew it.
Their show of force itself helped to make
them something to be reckoned with.
The same train brought many members
of other delegations, and so all at once, at
about 9 o'clock, the majority of the dele
i gates and of the leaders were on hand and
â  the real anti-convention hustling broke
into full blast
But the anti-Gould people were at sea
\ and the Gould boomers had regained their
j confidence.
The Alameda flop had not helped the <
Ryan boom, and ii was waiting for the |
later night to f> gain its force. Among the
anti-Gould people were heard curses of
Foote, who was a few uours before their
idol. Attorney W. M. Gibson of Stockton,
who was one of the bitter enemies of :
Gould in the San Joaquin delegation for a
time, threw up his hands. Then he waited
for the Ryan boom to get going again.
"Foote says that he is satisfied that
Gould is not a Daggett man," said Gibson,
witn derision rfc his words.
"Foote was in and out, in and out, with
us, and now he is out," said Recorder '
Glynn, and he said more with suppressed ,
indignation.
- The Buckleyites cursed Foote sorely.
They said they regarded him as an in
grate. They had boomed him for months; !
they recalled how they had won friends j
for him and had boomed him for the
chairmanship. Now he had gone into the
camp of the enemy just at the critical mo- |
ment when a possibility of victory seemed j
in sight.
There was much speculation as to what I
transpired between W. W. Foote and
Frank Gould during the hour's private |
conversation which they had upstairs in the \
Golden Eagle late in the afternoon, but it j
was all speculation. People on both sides
assumed that a deal of some sort was con- !
summated whereby Foote and his friends !
are to be benefited and John Daegett is
not to be helped.
It seemed unlikely that it would any
particular relation to Foote's candidacy
for delegate at large, for he was absolutely
certain of victory there. It was thought
that the result might have a favorable in
fluence on the fight of his friend Lay

mance for delegate from the Third Dis
trict.
Others guessed, probably unjustly, that
Foote would have something to say about
the appointment of the State executive
committee, and that possibly the way of
the Senatorial aspirations might have been
slightly smoothed.
There was no hint of anything discred
itable in the slightest degree from any
body except a very few of the Buckleyites,
who spoke hasty words in their wrath.
It was simply assumed that Foote re
ceived assurances in behalf of himself and
his friends which were of course satisfac
tory and, politically considered, in every
way proper. Foote, however, did not
cease his cursing of John Daggett and his
declarations of hostility to him when he
went into Gould's camp.
WOMAN SUFFRAGE.
Few Democratic Delegates Swear
Allegiance to the Cause.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 15.â Susan
B. Anthony, Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper and
her daughter Harriet arrived to-day, com
pleting the equal suffrage delegation in so
far as its work before the Democratic Con
vention is concerned. They to-day ap
pointed the committee that will appear be
fore the platform committee, if their peti
tion is allowed, to plead the cause of
woman. They have received no encour
agement whatever from any source, and
while they continue to hope they do not
expect the same treatment from the State
Democracy that was accorded them by the
Republicans.
The women have established head
quarters in parlor 28, third floor of the
Golden Eagle Hotel. In the oflice and
about the hallways of the hotel are neatly
printed placards announcing that fact
and cards are distributed everywhere an
nouncing that "You are respectfully in
vited to call at woman suffrage head
quarters," etc.
Very, very few have so far accepted the
invitation. No delegation has done so as
a body, although two or three counties
have instructed their delegates to vote for
woman suffrage. Some four or five indi
viduals nave called, among them Gavin
McNab and Max Popper, both assuring
the committee that they were heartily in
sympathy with their cause. J. A. Filcher
of Placer County, manager of the State
Board of Trade, went up the elevator with
the intention of doing something of that
kind, but looking in and seeing a room
full of ladies he backed out under some
subterfuge. He was afterward led back
by a newspaper man and made his little
speech.
The threatened organized opposition of
women of the State has not developed any
showing whatever. A number of prom
inent women have, on the contrary, en
listed with the cause. The wife of Warden
Anil called at the equal suffrage head
quarters to-day and declared her active al
legiance. She said she would do all in her
power to assist the cause. Mrs. S. J.
Hanchell and Mrs. Frank Orcutt of this
city also dropped in and assured the com
mittee of their support.
The ladies are keeping close to their
headquarters and are not attempting any
personal canvass of the delegates. The
headquarters wear a forlorn appearance
as compared to the busy scene it pre
sented during the Republican Convention.
The Republicans manifested their appre
ciation of the ladies in a very marked
decree. â¢
"What we are particularly afraid of,"
said Mrs. Ida Harper, who acts especially
as the press committee, "is that we shall
be ignoredâ that is, that the platform
shall be silent regarding equal suffrage.
If the Democratic party is opposed to
equal suffrage we wish it to so say in its
platform. Then we shall know who our
friends are and who our enemies. We are
neither Democrats nor Republicans, re
member, in this matter of securing en
franchisement. We have personal bear
ings, to be sure, but they are sunk in the
one purpose before us. Very many promi
nent women of the State who have Demo
cratic predilections will feel it deeply if
the Democratic party does less for us than
did the Republican.
"We have petitions to present here with
the signatures of 40,000 residents of the
State over 21 years of ag \ asking for the
suffrage amendment to the constitution.
The signers are about equally divided as to
sex. The signatures have been collected
within the last three months.
"Alameda is the banner county in this
matter. Now, suppose Alameda County's
delegation here should place itself in oppo
sition to us. as it is intimated it will do, I
maintain that it does not represent the
sentiment of its people.
"The Republican convention was rather
taken by surprise by the strength of our
campaign. There was no organized op
position to us. We came down here with
the outspoken and unqualified support of
The Call. That was a great thing for
us. It practically amounts to the differ
ence between then and now. Had we the
support of some paper that is to the Demo
cratic party what The Call is to the Re
publican party you would not see this in
difference of the delegates to-day. Our
cause was adopted by the Republican con
vention with a rush. Since then six
weeks have intervened, and the opponents
of suffrage in the Stateâ l will not say
what composes the opposition, but inter
ests that believe they will be injured by
the adoption of woman suffrageâ have or
ganized and made a hard fight against us.
That explains the situation." â¢
Susan B. Anthony and Anna H. Shaw
will compose the committee that wil
plead the cause of suffrage before the plat
form committee, provided leave is granted,
which is reasonably certain, as the right
of petition is not yet abrogated. The la
dies will be heard and bowed out. There
will be no reference to the question in the
platform it is believed. In the convention
Gavin McNab will, perhaps, offer a resolu
tion of sympathy or something of the
kind, and it will receive a dozen or more
votes, and with that the matter will be
passed. Speaking of the matter to-night
Miss Anthony said:
"The question of suffrage seems newer
to the Democratic party than to the Re
publican. The Republican party has ap
proached the subject often, passing senti
mental resolutions at least. But the
Democratic party, with professions of be
ing the party of the people, cannot ignore
the rights of woman without being un
true to i's own faith. The adoption of a
plank favoring suffrage would not in any
event commit the individual voter, for he
would vote his personal convictions on
the subject anyhow. The value we at
tach to such declaration is the free discus
sion of the subject that it insures. It
would open the columns of the newspa
pers to it and the orators would talk about
it. That is all that suffrage needs to win
âthat people understand it. I am cer
tain we will win this fall anyhow, but I
should think the Democratic party would
be glad of our aid in their contest."
HAMILTON FOR CHAIRMAN.
Placer Delegates Declare for the
Old War-Horse.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 15.â J. A.
Filcher, editor of the Auburn Herald and
manager of the State Board of Trade, and
the old Democratic war-horse, General
Joe Hamilton, headed the Placer delega
tion, which got in during the forenoon.
Filcher will be the representative of Placer
County on the new State Central Com
mittee.
Old Joe Hamilton ia known to every
Democrat in the State who has not jumped
into party activity within three or four
years. Hamilton was Attorney-General
of the State for two terms and has missed
but one convention in thirty years or
more.
On the way down the delegates dis
cussed the fuss about the chairmanship
and made up their minds that if the dele
gates kept on fighting at Sacramento they
would sprine Joe Hamilton for the chair
manship. The Placer delegation came
unpledged and undetermined about the
chairmanship and with a general prejudice
against Buckley, thougii without any par
ticular understanding or care about the
San Francisco contest.
"The delegates care particularly who is
chairman," said Mr. Fiicher. "They are
not against Gould, but they think that
the fight over the chairmanship is simply
a fight for power and plunder in San
Francisco, and they would probably favor
some good man who is not mixed up in
the fuss. They are against anything that
has Buckley attached to it, on general
principles."
It is on such material which comes roll
ing into town from all over the Siate,
made up of stanch, true and unprejudiced
men undecided about the fisiht, that the
anti-Gould people rely to swell their initial
strength to the necessary majority. It is
because there are so many such delegates
that there is any uncertainty about how
the big fight over the chairmanship, Dag
gett and the San Francisco contest will
break to-morrow. The friends of Gould
still contend that there is no uncertainty
in regard to his success, and it really
seems that they have good grounds for
their hopefulness.
It is said the Shasta delegation has also
prepared a sweeping currency plank which
it will ask the convention to make a part
of the platform. The plank reads as fol
lows:
Resolved, That we are in favor of the United
States Government coining every ounce of sil
ver mined within its borders at the ratio of 16
to 1, without any condition whatsoever.
HOSPITABLE CITIZENS.
Careful Preparations for the Care
of Delegates.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 15.â John
Markely, secretary of the State Central
Committee and member of the citizens'
committee on arrangements, was busy as
a nailer all day with important labors
which not many delegates thought or
cared much about. Markely has been the
leading authority in the work of prepara
tion for the convention whicu has been
done so well.
State Committee headquarters were
opened in the parlor of the Golden Eagle
in the morning, and during the day
chairmen of delegations filed belated cre
dentials, received badges and asked ques
tions. About forty proxies were filed dur
ing the day and many more will reach the
roll before the convention opens. Espe
cially careful arrangements for seating the
delegates have been made at the Pavilion,
in the vast interior of which the octagonal
muslin tent for the convention has been
put in order, with a seating capacity of
3000. Each delegation will sit next to an
aisle, and the delegations have been lo
cated so as to group them by Congressional
districts.
The people of Sacramento are display
ing hearty hospitality and careful atten
tion to their guests. Committees on halls,
music, accommodations, press, badges
and attaches have done their work care
fully. Accommodations are ready for the
.biggest crowd that may come. When the
convention is over the three conventions
will have cost the city about $3000. With
all the conventions Sacramento has paid
every dollar of party expense.
Chairman Willis, of the press committee,
is entitled to special consideration for the
attentions paid to visiting press represen
tatives.
Temporary clerical officers have b6en
provided without expense and they will
probably become the permenent conven
tion attaches. Most of tiiem have donated
their services. They include a secretary, a
chief clerk and four assistants, a sergeant
at-arms and five assistants, three porters
and four pages.
A big sounding-board has been placed
behind the platform ; the Pavilion is
prettily decorated, and the citizens of
Sacramento have done well thnir part to
make things pleasant for the big unpleas
antness.
The committee of citizens having in
charge arrangements for receiving and
seating the delegates has attended to its
duties in a manner that meets with the
approval of all visitors. William Beck
man is chairman of the general commit
tee. A. C. H ink son vice-chairman, J. O.

urer. The sub-committees are as follows:

GRATITUDE TO THE 6REAT HUDYAN.
Much Midnight Oil Burned at the Big
Institute by Eminent Physicians
to Benefit Mankind.
A Question not infrequently obtruding
ttselfupon the inquiring mind is this: Is
man degeneratingâ failing in vital force,
losing energy, lacking in that strong,
robust virile power which made the gigan-
tic gladiators of the arena such enviable
types of physical perfection, and. if so,
why? I give.it up. The solution of sucn,
a knotty problem would require a more
facile pen and subtle mind than I possess*,
so I will content myself with the broa<t
assertion that man is failing physically!.
But I also know that this failing may f>e
halted if the proper steps are taken and
taken in time.
I will try and tell how I first became \n-
troduced to the medical marvel of the BÂ«*e
the great Hudyan.
While walking along Montgomery stveet
about two months ago I was accosted byâ
as I supposed at the timeâ a perfect
stranger in so familiar and effusive a man-
ner as to betoken long "acquaintanceship.
I could see by the merry twinkle of his
full clear eye that he was enjoyingi ng my
embarrassment hugely. Concluding at last
he had had about as much fun at my ex-
pense as was consistent with street eti-
quette, I made bold to say, "Well, sir,
may I ask who you are, pray?"
"Wny ," calling me by name,
"don't you recognize your friemd Jack
?"
I seized his hand and stood paralyzed.
Was it possible tnat this was the same
man whom I had seen one short year
before a complete physical wreck, nervous,
irritable, melancholy, hair and eyelashes
gone, round-shouldered and ambitionlesa
â yet there could be no disputing the fact
that it was the same old Jack. But oh,
bow completely and miraculously reju-
venated. Why he looked like a gladiator
of the olden times, tall, erect, robust and
fearless; a sparkling eye and a firm grip.
The very embodiment' of marely strength
and beauty.
"Jack," I said, feeling somewhat dwarfed
in his lofty presence, "let us go and sit
down somewhere and you can tell me how
you discovered the famed rejuvenating
waters of Ponce de Leon ?"
When we were comfortably seated in an
adjacent cafe, he turned to me and admin-
istering a good rousing slap on my shoul-
ders, which nearly drove me through the
floor, said: "01dman.no mysterious or
Ponce de Leonism about it at all. Just
listen. You remember when I last saw
you, about a year ago, I was on the verge
of suicide. All the comforts of life had
been absorbed by my nervous and wasted
condition, and the end was near. One day
a friend advised me to go the Hudson
Medical Institute and try their celebrated
remedio-treatmentâ Hudyan. I went and
the wonderful result you see before your
eyes, and oh, my friend," and there were
tears in his eyes as he spoke, '"I bleas the
day I consulted the good 'doctors of the
Hudson Medical Institute and revere the
name of Hudyan.'' After listening to the
graphic account of his miraculous cure Dy
the great Hudyan I have no hesitancy in
recommending any man who may be suf-
fering from any of the many sapping dis-
eases of which men aie the victims, to call
on, or write to the HUDSON MEDICAL
INSTITUTE for testimonials, corner
StocKton and Market streets.

ENGLISH IS FOR GOULD.
Declares for the Stockton Man
Among: the Delegates.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 15.â Among
the arrivals this afternoon were W. W.
Foote and "Bill" English. They are al
most equally active and outspoken on the
street and among delegates, but English
draws the line at the line beyond his per
sonal and political friends â that is, to-
day he will not talk to newspaper men.
"Don't you see?" he says, "1 am a
Federal office-holder; I can't talk. The
currency question? Great Scott! that is
the very question I can't touch."
Immediately, however, Mr. English goes
forth among the delegates shaking hands
and saying the things that he believes
will be most effective. He declares to
them to-night that he is for Gould for
chairman, just like Foote.
ANDY CLUNIE OF SOLANO.
Anti-Junta Delegates Aro Skir-
mishing for Proxies.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 15.âEvery
thing now points to a condition of war the
moment the convention proceedings open
to-morrow. Thus far the anti-Junta dele
gates have secured somewhere in the
neighborhood of fifty proxies from interior
delegates, and on that occasion Andy
Clunie will hail from Solano and J. H.
O'Brien from Santa Cruz.
These precautions have been taken so as
to make certain that the representatives
of the so-called Buculey delegation will
have a rieht to the floor. Their first move
will be to ask that the Junta delegation,
which is now on the temporary roll, be
stricken from it, and that neither of the
contesting factions from San Francisco be
given a voice in the convention until their
right to sit therein is determined.
This is a move that is widely and
strongly favored by the interior delegates,
who are disinterested and who claim that
any other course is likely to create a split,
net only in the Democracy of San Fran
cisco but in the entire State, and that, on
the otner hand, if such a course were fol
lowed there would be no cause on either
side for discord or dissatisfaction.
William M. Gibson is a delegate from
Stockton, the home of Gould. Speaking
of this phase of the situation this after
noon, Mr. Gibson said :
"I am decidedly in favor of the contest
ing delegations being excluded from any
participation in the temporary organiza
tion of the convention, in the interest of
decency. lam prepared, if no one else
does, to make a motion to that effect in
the convention. In regard to this matter
of contesting delegates, I hold that a man,
although he be elected chairman of a con
vention, should not act in the interest of
his friends and thereby do injustice to
others.
"Now, Mr. Gould has constantly reiter
ated his opposition to the seating of what
is Known as the anti-Junta delegation, and
if he is elected chairman of the conventi on
he has got to be able to overcome his prej

IROQUOIS POW-WOW.
Sacramento Young Braves Admit
ted to the Councils.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jane 15.â As
the train bearing the San Francisco
Iroquois Tribe of the Six Nations rolled
into the depot here to-night, it was greeted
by the warwhoop delivered in great shape
by the ambitious young warriors of Sacra
mento who, burning with eagerness to
enter upon the warpath, made the high
depot ring with the slogan of their tribe.
As soon as the visiting warriors had
gathered together their implements of
warfare the trail toward headquarters,
situated at the Golden Eagle Hotel, was
taken up, and, headed by the tomtoms
and other musical instruments of the
hand, the stalwart braves tramped lustily
toward the campfires of their brethren.
The route of march was brilliantly illu
minated by red fire and roman candles,
and the whoops of the excited warriors,
â¢ who to-morrow light the council tire and
listen to the speeches of the sagamores
preparatory to entering upon the warpath,
drew from the wigwams a dense crowd of
admiring onlookers.
After a brief rest the City braves as
sembled in the council lodge, and the Ho
de-No-San-Nee of the tribes was cele-
brated. Raleigh Barcar, grand sachem
of the State, assumed the headdress
and oaraphernalia of his office and,
supported by Max Popper, grand
medicine man; J. D. RucHock, sagamore;
J. P. McLeroy, chief scout: J. D. Mer
rill, past sachem, and J. C. Gorman, State
organizer, started the council fire and
passed the pipe of peace, Judge W. A.
Henry of the local tribe acting as guardian
of the pipe. After the necessary prelimin-
Aries the aspiring and perspiring young
braves of the Sacramento branch of the
tribe approached the council lodge, and
the vigilant scouts gave notice of their
presence by stating that strangers were
spying around the camp.
When challenged the young braves said
they were members of a great tribe.
"There are but two great tribes," was
sternly retorted; "The Ãepublican and the
Democrats. To which do you belong?"
"We are Democrats," was answered and
then arose the cries of all the denizens
of the forests, from the shrill scream of
the panther to the solemn hoot of the owl,
and the ambitious young braves hied
slowly into the council lodge and submit
ted to the torture test for the purpose of
displaying tneir endurance and bravery,
preparatory to starting out to gather scalps.
. At the close of the ceremonies E. G. Ely
was proclaimed sachem; Charles Hughes,
first warrior; A. Mazzini, second warrior;
J. H. Walker, custodian of the annals of
the tribe; George Randal, financial secre
tary; Frank T. Lyman, treasurer; H. M.
La Rue Sr., A. C. Hinkson, P. Kelly, D. J.
Manning and R. O. Cravans, trustees.
After a feast the warriors dispersed to
their wigwams, but for hours after the
forest re-echoed with the war-whoop of
scattered brav.es who had indulged in the
fire-water of the paleface.
DAN OSTROM'S AMBITION.
Would Co to Chicago as Delegate
at Large.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 15.â Senator
Dan Ostrom of Yuba, who has been men
tioned as a possible delegate at large, is
on the ground and is using ail his indi
vidual influence as well as that of his
friends to secure the honor of being sent
to Chicago. He stated in the course of a
brief conversation that there were only
two things that he desired to go to Chi
cago to see accomplished â one was the
passage of a resolution recommending a
change in the constitution of the United
States that would permit of an income
revenue tax being legally imposed, the
other was the adoption of a free-silver
plank in the Democratic National plat
form.
THE MUSE UNLEASHED.
John Daggett the Hero In a Fugitive
Screed of Doggerel.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 15.â A fugi
tive screed in doggerel was floating around
among the delegates to-night, tor which
no author could be found. Nobody sus
pected W. W. Foote of writing it, though
he would probably concur in the senti
ment so clumsily and inelegantly ex
pressed :
There's a man whose grave we are bound to
sink through,
Dig it,
He's dug it,
Daggett.
His political grave is in old Siskiyou,
Dig it,
He's dug it,
John Daggett.
It is rather early for the campaign poet,
but Democrats are proverbially forehanded
in such matters.
REIS FAVORS RYAN
Belleves Could Is Not Now In' an
Impartial Frame of Mind.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., June 15. -J. 0.
Reis of Contra Costa, one of the seven
delegates from that county, is in favor of
Ryan for chairman as against Gould and
believes that the other members of the
delegation feel the same as he does on this
question. They believe that Gould is not
in that frame of mind that will permit
him to act without prejudice in the mat
ter of naming the committee on creden
tials, who will presumably have the
settlement of the factional fight in San
Francisco.
BUDD WILL NOT ATTEND.
The Governor Yields to the Com
mand of His Physician.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 15.âGover
nor Budd is not expected to attend the
convention, owing to the injury of his
knee at his home in Stockton.
"He is anxious to come to meet the
leading members of the party," said E. L.
Colnon, "but his doctor vetoed the trip.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 16, 1896.
FOOTE YIELDS TO GOULD
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June i^.âl have just had a long
interview with Mr. Gould, and he assured me that he is here
in the interest of no individual or clique, and I accepted his
statement absolutely. He will not be dominated by Mr.
Daggett or any of his friends in the appointments of com
mittees or otherwise. He will make all his appointments in
the interest ot the whole party, including members of the
State Central Committee, if he appoints any members of that
body.
My judgment is that the convention will be in favor of
a strong anti-monopoly plank in its platform, such as that
passed by the Fresno convention, with certain additions con
cerning the funding bill, which was not an issue' when the
action of the Fresno convention was taken. I believe the \
convention will declare for the unlimited coinage of silver at
the ratio of 16 to 1. I don't think the convention will stand
any straddle on the financial issue. If such an attempt is
made and is carried through the convention it will be fatal
to the success of the party.
I don't think the Democrats will take any action on!
the question of woman suffrage ; that is to say, they will
decline to favor it ; and the committee will have nothing to
say on it in the platform that is presented to the convention.
Of course the ladies will be accorded a respectful and
attentive hearing before the committee on platform, if they
desire it, and I presume that will be the case.
I expect the State and National administrations will be
indorsed ; the National possibly in a qualified way, on
account of Mr. Cleveland's attitude on the money question.
I think it was a mistake not to have called the conven
tion two or three days later, so that we could take advantage
of the mistakes which we expect the Republican convention
at St. Louis will make. They are all mixed, up now, and in a
few days more they will not know to which party they
belong. W. W. FOOTE.
He has declared that he would come any
how, but Ido not believe that his doctor
will let him."
Latest advices from Stockton confirm
the report that the Governor will not be
able to leave bis room for several days.
ATTACK ON GOULD.
A Buck'eyite Attempts to Thrash
the State Chairman.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 15.-Chair
man Gould of the State Central Comrnit
te came near receiving a sound thrashing
at the bands of Mike Tannien, an indig
nant and angry member of the Buckley
delegation, to-night on the corner of
Seventh and X streets diagonally opposite
the Golden Eagle Hotel.
There was a caucus of the Buckley dele
gation to-night at their headquarters in
Smith's Hall on the east side of Seventh
street, between X and L. It was held for
the purpose of taking final and determined
steps to secure rights to the floor of the
convention before temporary organization
waÃ effected.
The session began at 10 o'clock and after
considerable discussion it was decided to
appoint a committee to wait on Mr. Gould
and request him to have badges of ad
mission to the convention ball distributed
to the members of the Buckley delegation.
James I. Stanton, E. D Young, Charley
Hagcerty and Walter Gallagher were ap
pointed on this committee. They found
Mr. Gould, accompanied by Mr. McNab,
passing along X street, and just as they
were about to pass over to the Golden
Eagle M,r. Gould was informed that this
committee desired to see him on impor
tant business.
They stepped aside out of the hearing
of passer3-by and the demand of theÃuck
leyites was then presented to Mr.
Gould. He denied their request and ex
plained that the Juntadelegation had been
placed on the roll and that only the mem
bers of that delegation would be given
badges and seats in the convention pend
ing the action of the committee on cre
dentials, and added that the Buckley peo
ple would not be allowed on the floor.
Eye-witnesses of the Buck.ey delegation
who were within earshot state that Mr.
Gould's manner was so -arbitrary and
offensive that one of their number,
Mike Tannien, could not restrain himself
and seized hold of Mr. Gould with the evi
dent intention of beating him. Before,
however, he could carry out hfs design the
members of the committee interfered and
peace for the time being was restored.
DEADLY WORK OF

Himself.

A Stranger Entered His Office
With a Written Demand
for $6000.
UNDER THREATS OF DYNAMITE
The Banker Refused to Comp y and
the Shooting Immediately
Fo lowed.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 15.-About
12:30 o'clock this afternoon a stranger
who gave the name of Charles Clark, and
who was apparently about 30 years of age,
went into the New Amsterdam Bank, at
the corner of Broadway and Thirty-ninth
street. He asked for President George R.
Wyckoff and was admitted to his office.
A short time after he had entered the
office the clerks in the bank we.c startled
by hearing two shots fired in quick suc
cession, followed by cries for help. On en
tering the office both men were found
badly wounded lying on the floor.
An ambulance was summoned and both
men were taken the New York Hospital.
Wyckoff wa found to have been shot in
the side of the abdomen. The wound is
very dangerous, but the doctors say he
may possibly recover.
Clark also was suffering from a bullet
wound in the abdomen. His case is the
more serious of the two and there is little
if any hope for him.
According to the story told by Wyckoff
Clark presented a letter to him when he
entered the office.
It was written on a letterhead of the
Hotel Marlborough. It contained a de
mand for $6000 and threatened Wyckoff
with death unless he furnished the
money. It is also stated that the bearer
had a partner outside who had Wyckoff
"covered." If he made any alarm or re
fusea to give the money a stick of dyna
mite would be thrown into the bank that
would blow up the building.
President Wyckoff, after reading the let
ter, refused Clark the money and ihelatter
then shot him and tried to kill himself.
T c police believe Clark insane.
On the sheet of paper which the man
handed President Wyckoff was written:
"Wewant $6000; five $1000 and twossoo bills.
I will shoot you if you make a false move,
so be careful. My partner is outside and
has you covered. If you make an alarm
within three minutes after I leave here he
will throw a stick of dynamite through the
front entrance. Put the money in the
envelope; don't talk."
The note bore no signature. President
Wykoff, after reading the note, rose from
his chair ana said : "I can't do that at
once. 1 will have to consult the other of
ficials of the bant."
As he said this he walked toward the
door. He had got about twelve or fifteen
feet away from his caller, when Clark drew
a revolver and lired at him.
The ball struck President Wyckoff in
the abdomen. He staggered out through
the rear door of the room into the main
ro' m of the bank and made his way about
half-way to the entrance of the bank,
when he sank exhausted on the floor.
mil Cnucuii Until ltnylight.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., June 16, 1 a. m.-
At this hour many delegates are still in
secret caucus and from the indication the
argument will last until daylight. The
situation nas not changed materially since
midnight and the outlook is substantially
as out'ined in the earlier dispatches.
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
STANTON UTTERS A THREAT
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 15.â We have assurances
from many delegates from the country that we will get fair
and impartial treatment. There are many who are of the
opinion that all local fights should not be brought to this con
vention, but should be settled in the localities in which they
originate. We came up here with the expectation of being
treated fairly, and we have every assurance that we will be
so treated.
We have learned that there will be an attempt made to
exclude this delegation from seats in the convention, and
place the Junta men on the roll, and so allow them to be
judges of their own cases. If such a condition of affairs
should prevail, it will be an act of the grossest injustice. The
gentlemen who came up here to represent the regular De
mocracy, of which delegation I am chairman, are going to
fight this matter and leave the issue entirely in the hands of
the State Convention. We do not expect that they will send
us home without giving us a fair and impartial hearing.
In conversation with delegates to-day I learned that
there is a movement among the country delegates to exclude
both San Francisco factions from the floor of the convention
until their rights to seats are determined, and the determina
tion of the matter will be brought before the convention itself
instead of being left to the decision of the committee on cre
dentials. If such be the course pursued we have no fear of
the result, but if we are to go before a packed committee,
appointed by a man who will not pledge himself to act fairly,
then this fight will not be settled in this convention.
I think the different resolutions adopted by our delega
tion, including the indorsement of free silver coinage, will be
incorporated in the State platform. The country delegates
seem to be almost a unit on the question of free silver. The
convention will also pass a strong anti-funding resolution.
I believe that three of the delegates at large will un
doubtedly be Congressmen James Maguire, Senator Stephen
M. White and W. W. Foote.
The question of woman's suffrage has not to my
knowledge been discussed to any extent among the dele
gates.
The chief question up to now seems to be the fight
between the two San Francisco delegations. There is
considerable talk this evening of there being another
candidate placed in the field for - chairman against Mr.
Gould. I refer to Judge W. A. Ryan. His adherents claim
that they would have at least no votes to start with
from the southern counties. James I. Stanton.
COLNON SCORES THE A.P.A.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June i^.â This State Convention
will adopt a plank declaring in favor of free and unlimited
coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to i. Not only that, but it
will require of the delegates sent to Chicago that they oer
sonally pledge themselves to advocate such a declaration
by the National Convention. There may be delegates chosen
who have personal and private leanings toward a gold plat
form, and who may question the wisdom of the majority.
The personal pledge would be effective in such cases.
There is considerable feeiing apparent .among the coun
try delegates with regard to the assumption of Daggett to
control the convention. There is, on this account* consider
able opposition to Gould for chairman, because of the belief
that he is over-friendly with Daggett. To-night may develop
a man for chairman who can concentrate the strength of
the opposition to Gould and win the chairmanship. W. A.
Ryan of Los Angeles, who aspires to the honor, I under
stand, is a very good and capable man, but he does not seem
to be sufficiently well known. A man known as well as W.
W. Foote, known also to be against Daggett as much as
he is, might win.
The convention will condemn the American Protective
Association in plain terms. It ought to be condemned.
There is no place in politics in this country for a secret re
ligious organization, or anti-religious, if you please.

SEQUEL TO A DIVORCE
Mrs. Morrissey of Tacoma Seeks
Protection From Her Ex-
Husband.
Their Daughter X dnaped by the
Father ani Subsequ ntly R. kid
naped by the Mother.
TACOMA, Wash., June 15.â Mrs. Edith
Morrissey. who in April last secured a di
vorce from her husband, is a badly fright
ened woman. Her ex-husband, David
Morr;ssey, is a very indignant man, and
the Sh -riff's deputies and office force are
on the lookout for trouble. While Mrs.
Morrissey's divorce suit was pending,
David Morrissey, it is alleged, waylaid
Kathleen, their only daughter, on her way
to school, kidnaped her and took her to
British Columbia.
Mrs. Morrissey immediately went into
court and a writ was issued commanding
Morrissey to produce the child. He, how
ever, was safe in British Columbia, out of
the court's jurisdiction, and nothing more
came of the case until this week, when
Private Detective Duffield, w:o had been
employed by Mrs. Morrissey, returned
from British Columbia with the child.
Perhaps he had kidnaped her, and per
haps he had not; anyway he ad her.
Now Mr. Morrissey has arrived on the
scene with blood in his eye. He is quoted
as saying he will s n* Mrs. Morrissey and
the child to the bottom of the bay before
he will allow t em t leave here alive. All
this has been reported to the Sheriff's
office, and protection is promised to Mrs.
Morrissev and her child. They desire to
start for England, and will do so if trouble
can be avoided. Kathleen is a very pretty
girl, 12 years old. Bhe apparently prefers
to remain with her mother, though, she
says, her father was very kind to her.

IXERCISE WITH REAL SWORDS
From All Indications the Carnival
Will Surpass Anything Before
Attempted.
SANTA CKI'Z, Cal., June 15.â A grand
chorus of welcome shouts went out from
the hundreds of people on the beach and
wharves and along the cliff drive this
afternoon as the Philadelphia rounded
Lighthouse Point and poked her nose into
the cairn waters of the bay. The bright
sun was dropping down toward its ocean
bed.
The sky was clear and the atmosphere
was of that delightful temperature that
makes a perfect Santa Cruz June day. A
gentle breeze blew in, just enough to tem
per the sun's heat. A strong counter cur
rent was running close in that tossed the
>mall craft and the fishermen's boats about
ill a friendly, jolly way that gave them the
appearance of extending a series of courte
ous bows to the visitors.
The white cruiser slipped quietly and
swiftly aloiu' the outer edge of the bay,
holding her side toward the city and giv
ing the audience a beautiful view of her.
It was a sight not often seen here, though
appreciated, not more from that fact than
from the fact the Philadelphia is a guest
of the city, come to participate in
the magnificent display of the carnival
and to act as tutor to the Fourth Gun Di-
vision, N. G. C, whose members recognize
the grand opportunity thus offered them
to acquire knowiedge of actual ship prac
tice. The city considers it also a great
honor that just at a time when the whole
State is turning toward Santa Cruz the
Pniladelphia and the Monadnock should
be permitted to add realism to the ro
mance of the Venetian water fetes.
There was some disappointment ex
pressed that the Monadnock did not steam
in with the Philadelphia, as was expected.
But that was dispelled just an hour later
when the Monadnock glided in. passing
the bow of the Philadelphia and casting
tier anchor a little farther up the bay and
just a little nearer the shore.
So the interest was doubled by the order
of the coming in of the two ships, for each
presented a distinctively different appear-
ance in its position in the water as well as
its construction. After the Philadelphia
had cast anchor, off Railroad wharf,
she was boarded by Lieutenant A. A.
Morey and Ensign Lindsay of the Fourth
Gun Division, Naval Battalion, N. G. C.
Within half an hour the naval reserve
launch returned and took on board Mayor
Clark, Lieutenant-Governor Jeter and
other citizens representing the carnival
association and the city, who were formally
presented to Admiral Beardsley and his
staff and Captain Cotton and his officers.
Tne visitors were entertained for an
hour or more and shown about the vessel,
rinding much to interest them in the de
tails of manipulation of the machinery
and the guns. While in the cabin Admiral
Beardslee told a story of Sharkey, the
pugilist, who is misnamed tlje "Marine."
Sharkey was not a marine, he said, but a
bluejacket, and though a man of such
strong physique, he came from a very
sickly family. The listeners wondered.
"It's a fact,'' said tlie Admiral, "Sharkey
obtained more leaves of absences to visit
his sick relatives than any ten other men
aboard the Philadelphia. When he had
visited a sick relative for the last time
during a spell of sickness be would re
turn with honors won in the prize ring.
Of course Sharkey had to give up prize
righting or the ship, and he gave up the
ship.
"But Sharkey was not a 'marine.' He
was a bluecoat and one of the soberest and
most attentive to duty. He quieted many
a disturbance among his mates, and was a
worthy fellow aboard ship and a good
fighter.' 1
After watching the coming in of the Mo
nadnock and viewing the Philadelphia the
visitors returned to the city to prepare for
the formal reception ashore on to-morrow
night, and the participation of the blue
coats in the parade and drill on Wednes-
day. Whatever shall be done by the men
from the war ships for the pleasure of the
rarnival visitors will of course be done
where the public will be invited without
charge.
Admiral Beardslee and his staff-captain
(Cotton) of the Philadelphia and his offi
cers and Captain O. Suraner of the Monad
nock and his officers will be tendered a re-
ception by the Carnival Association and
the city to-morrow night at the Sea Beach
Hotel, and at the conclusion of the recep
tion a ball will be tendered them by the
Sea Beach Hotel.
Harbor Commissioner F. S. Chadbourne
and" bis son William were guests of Ad
miral Beardslee, coming down from tnc
City. They will return by train to-mor
row. Admiral Beardslee said they had a
pleasant though uneventful trip down,
and until noon kept in sight of the Mo
nadnock, who was steaming at about
eight knots, when the Philadelphia parted
company, with her mate and pushed her
speed to twelve knots, arriving just one
hour ahead.
The City Trustees are busy to-n?ght
with matters pertaining to the opening
day, and the streets are crowded with peo
ple who come out to witness a very pretty
sight presented by the Creek Power Com
pany, whose lights are now ready for dis
tribution in this city.
The Odd Fellows' building was illu
minated with several hundred incan
de-cent lamps arranged after the design
of the front elevation of the building. It
makes a fine display of electric lighting,
and Manager Fred Swanton was so proud
of the effect that he engaged the services
of the Santa Cruz city band for an open
air concert that gave the people a good
rleal of pleasure.
M. C. Osborn Ims been engaged in the
delicate task of drilling twenty young
ladies to handle the sword like soldierson

and with the continued practice they will
have for another week their work will be
one of the handsomest and most attractive
events of the carnival. Their uniforms
are blue reefer jackets, short skirts and
leggins trimmed in silver, while their
swords are real ones of the pattern used
by the Knights Templar in their drill
work.
The young ladies are delighted with the
exercise which amply repays them for
their service to the carnival even were
they not so desirous as they are of aiding
the carnival by their pretty exhibitions.
Following are the names of the youne
ladies who will give the sword drill ex
hibition during the carnival.

Whitney, Mabel Smith, Ethel Gillen,
Crystale Osborn, Grace Stretter, Frankie
Collins, Georgie Collins, Alma Osterhus,
Viola Hubbel, Gertie Chappell, Mabel
Beesh, Bella Abrarns, Ethel Bartlett,
Anna Casebeer, Mabel Lask, Jessie Wil
liams, Flora Thesig and Annie Beas.
All things are now ready and the incom
ing trains to-day brought enough visitors
to assure the opening of the carnival a
success. The visitors have been coming
gradually until to-day. They are being
easily and comfortably disposed of as to
hotel accommodations.
GLAD TO SEE THEM

15.000 and 20,000.
"We carried the rural districts by largely
increased majorities, but lost in the larger
cities. Notwithstanding the defeat of our
ticket I do not think it should be regarded
in any light except that of a victory."
During the time of the Lexow investi
gation there was hardly a mail that came
in that did not bring the Senator an anony
mous letter threatening him with dyna
mite and all kinds of violent deaths.
"But," added he, with a quiet smile,
"it is the silent man whom you have to
fear â not the man who threatens you be
forehand. The man who goes around
with a brass band swearing that he is
going to annihilate you is the very last
man who is going to do it."
The Senator was not averse to talking
on the financial question. He is for Mor
ton and gold. For gold because that
metal is the recognized currency of the
commercial world.
If it were tin it would be equally good,
ior every nation that has commercial rela
tions with another nation has the same
currency.
"If we could continue to isolate ourselves
from the rest of the world," continued
the speaker, "and give up all our exports,
we could afford to establish any currency
we pleased. The baser metal is bound to
remain while the other goes abroad."
Among those who called at California
headquarters to-day were Rev. Gilbert A.
Ottman. up to a few months ago rector of
St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Sacra
mento. Mr. Ottman left Sacramento to re
side in St. Louis.
His bad taste in the matter of climate
has brought its own punishment, and I
smiled when 1 saw him perspire. Will H.
Gagan and sister of San Francisco are
stopping here on their way East.
They will take a peep at the conven
tion. Mr. Gagan is a well-known drug
gist. He was formerly a reporter on the
San Francisco dailies.
Another big brass band, headed by a
drum-major topped with a white bearskin,
has just marched into the lobby playing
"The Suwanee River" and "Dixie." The
Missourians are yelline with joy.
Then some one among the newcomers
shouts for Tom Reed and the building
shakes with the roar that goes up.

STATE COMMITTEE DOINGS.
Election of Officers of the Different
Delegations.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 15.â A singular
state of affairs exists in the California
delegation. The four contestants who
were seated by the National Committee,
after having been turned down by the
State Committee in Sacramento, have now
practically bolted. It came about in this
way:
Last Saturday, while en route to St.
Louis, the delegation held a meeting and
resolved to ask the convention to undo
the work of the National Committee so
far as to give all parties to the four con
tests a seat and half a vote each. This
afternoon a delegation caucus was held
and Denison, Spear, Kowalsky and Hock
heimer, the four men seated by the
National Committee, protested against the
other four participating in the proceed
ings and moved to strike them off the roll.
This, after a heated debate, was ruled out
of order and then Denison, Hockheimer,
Spear and Kowalsky walked out. They
say they will hold a caucus themselves,
send in their own list of names for all
committees and reopen the question of
National Committeeman, which has been
settled by naming John D. Spreckels.
The Californians are therefore very thor
oughly split.
When National Committeeman de
Young heard of the bolt he rushed over to
the California headquarters and told the
bolters to go back, that they were making
fools of themselves. Three of the four
then returned to the caucus. A. B. Lem
mon was named for member of the com
mittee on resolutions, O. A. Hale for com
mrttee on permanent organization, F. H.
Short on rules, Frank Miller on committee
to notify Presidential nominee, and U. 8.
Grant for honorary vice-president of the
convention.
The delegates who left the caucus will
probably act with the delegates at the
next meeting.
lowa this afternoon elected the follow
ing: Member of the committee on resolu
tions, J. H. Gear; on credentials, W. P.
Hepburn; on rules, H. W. Macomber;
permanent organization, E. 0. Roach ; to
notify nominee for President, Calvin Man
ning; to notify nominee for Vice-Presi
dent, C. M. Judkin; honorary vice-presi
dent. A. B. CuTnmingg. J. W. Blythe was
named for National Committeeman, but
declined, and A. B. Cummings was sub

sequently chosen, as was L. Banks Wilson
honorary vice-president, vice Cummings,
resigned.
The financial plank adopted by tbe del
egation after a very warm debate and by
a vote of 15 to 9 opposes the free coinage
of silver pending international agreement; j
favors the use of gold, silver and paper I
kept on a parity and the enactment of
laws to accomplish it; favors the use of
silver as money, either through interna
tional agreement to secure a common
ratio, with free coinage at such ratio by
the agreeing nations, or by concurrent leg
islation of the leading nations to accom
plish the purpose.
William Lamb, the present State chair
man of the Republican party in the old
commonwealth of Virginia, was this after
noon completely overthrown as a result of
his effort to stem the McKinley tide in
that state. He was supposed to have
been for Reed, but all events show ne was
for anybody to beat McKinley, and as
chairman ot the State organization earn
estly sought to accomplish this result.
He failed, however, and when the State
convention met was sent as one of the
delegates at large under cast-iron instruc
tions to vote for McKinley. When Mr.
Lamb sought the honor of a re-election as
the Virginia member of the National
Committee he found the State delegation
practically unanimous for George E. Bow
den, who was chosen.
It was not at all necessary, but ex-Gov- I
ernor Foraker coula not resist the terapta- j
tion at tfie Ohio meeting this afternoon to
introduce a resolution instructing the dele
gates to vote for McKinley. The resolu
tion was received with three cheers and a
tiger and went through with a whirl. The
financial plank was not referred to during
the informal discussion of various topics
by the delegates. There appeared to be a
tacit understanding that that subject was
perfectly safe in the hands of the men who
were to be put upon the committee on
resolutions.
The convention comraitteemen selected
were: Chairman of the delegation, Gover
nor Bushnell; resolutions, ex-Governor
Foraker; credentials, Judge A. C. Thomp
son; permanent organization, General
Charles A. Grosvenor; rules, Congress
man George W. Wilson; to notify tbe
nominee for President, M. A. Hanua.
The selection of a representative to
notify the nominee for Vice-Presi
dent was postponed. As has been pre
dicted Charles T. Curtis of Columbus, one
of tne most ardent of the Foraker follow
ers, was elected member of the National
Committee, to succeed William M. Harm.
The Illinois delegation elected officers
as follows: Nationnl Committeeman, T.
N. Jamieson; member of committee on
resolutions, R. W. Patterson ; on creden
tials, W. A. Rodenberg; on permanent or
ganization, J. O. Humphrey; on rules, J.
T. McKnight; to notify nominee for
President, C. H. Deane; to notify nom
inee for Vice-President, I. L. Elwood;
honorary vice-president, J. W. Fifer;
chairman of delegation, R. J. Oglesby;
vice-chairman, J. W. Fifer.
The delegates then entered upon a hot
discussion of the financial plank.
Speeches were made by H. A. Jones, R.
W. Patterson, Judge Hamlin, Duncan
McDougall, General G. T. Henderson and
J. M. Smyth. A resolution favoring the
gojd standard was finally adopted by a
vole of 42 to 6.
Chicago was favored as . the head
quarters of the National Republican Com
mittee.
It may not be significant, but the Idaho
! delegation, one of the strongholds of free
| silver, in making up its committee assign
; ments to-day neglected to fill the place of
I National Committeeman and members of
the committee to notify the president and
vice-president the three places that would
naturally remain unfilled if it were the in

maining places were filled as follows:

; The Pennsylvania delegation met in

Resolutions favoring the largest appro
priations for the improvement of rivers
and harbors consistent with the condition

. representation in the National convention
on the basis of votes cast, were â  referred to j
i the Resolutions committee of the conven
l tion with the approval of the delegation.
General Reeder, Secretary of the Com
monwealth of Pennsylvania, furnished the
only excitement of the meeting. He
â¢ stated that in the conventions at Chicago
and Minneapolis each delegate had been
allotted live extra seats, and while the
seating capacity of the hall here is larger
than any previously used, only two extra
, seats are to be given to delegates. He said
he believed it the right and duty of the
delegation to ask for an inquiry as to what
had been done with all the seats. His
remarks were greeted with applause. He
continued: : .-, \
"I understand that the seating capacity
of the hall is 15,000. Take all of the dele
gates and multiply the number by four
and there are 11,000 seats unaccounted for.
What has become of them?"
"Sold," said a member.
"Yes, sold; and for sale at auction shops
and on the streets of St. Louis," continued
General Reeder. He urged that the Penn
sylvania delegation enter a formal protest.
This was done by unanimous vote, and
Messrs. Elkins, Flood and Reeder were
appointed a committee to present the pro
test.
The delegates from South Dakota got to
gether to-day and elected L. B. French
chairman. A. B. Kittredge was re-elected
to the National Committee. The delega
tion was not agreed on the money plank,
but polled 5 to 3 for gold.
"Mr. Filley is a good Republican and an
energetic worker for his party and the
members of the Missouri delegation did
not like to turn him down, but we
were compelled to put a stop to
the concentration of Republican politics
in this State under the control of one
man," were the words of one of the promi
nent members ot the Missouri delegation,
spoKen shortly after its organization meet
ing had adjourned.
Balloting for member of the National
Committee was somewhat exciting but
resulted in a victory for Mr. Kerens, who
received 19 votes to 12 cast for Mr. Filley
and 3 for Mr. Warner.

AN A. P. A. MEETING.
The Speakers Were Opposed to
McKlnley for President.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 15.â A mass-meet
ing of six councils of the A. P. A. was
held to-night in a hall in North St. Louis.
Among the speakers were Congressman
Linton, State President Stevens and
Mayor Webster Davis of Kansas City.
The object of the meeting was to ex
press dissent at the action of the Republi
can National Committee in supporting
Kerens as against Filley in the contests
for seats in the National Convention.
All the speeches were wildly vehement
against the Republican committee. Tne
probability of McKinley's nomination was
touched upon.
Mayor Davis said the general confer
ence of the A. P. A. at Washington had
been faint-hearted. McKinley was an
enemy of the A. P. A. and if his vote
would elect the Ohio man it would not be
cast.
Congressman Linton spoke more guard
edly. A rising vote on a resolution to
condemn the action of the National Re
publican Committee for seating the
Kerens delegates was declared carried,
and the meeting adjourned.

THE CALL S PEAKS FOR ALL.
Now for the convention.
Things begin to move to-d&y.
They now call him Hanna the Great.
There will be no prolonged agony at Bt
YoU will get all the news from all bides
in The Call.
We might as well be getting McKinley
banners ready for the ratification meet
ings.
Whether it be (iould or not Gould it will
be a very small potato for a party to fight
over.
The Sacramento convention would con
fer a favor on its party if it would name a
favorite.
It is now agreed on all sides that Mark
Hanna is-a man who knows how to attend
to business.
When Republican prosperity comes the
Democrats will get their share of it, so
they needn't kick.
We shall get from St. Louis the harmony
of thought and from Sacramento the
sound of chin music.
Budd may possibly squeeze out an in
dorsement from the convention, but Cleve
land has lost his cinch.
The Buckleyites at Sacramento will stick
to straight liquor, but the Daggett men
will call for mint juleus.
It is hard to tell wLat Daggett thinks he
is doing and still harder to tell what he
thinks he is doins it for.
The only thing in which St. Louis ana
Sacramento will resemble each other wiJl
be the heat of the weather.
The Democrats concede their party is in
a hole, but they seem to think they can
get it out by lighting it out.
Sacramento may call her show a con
vention out of politeness, but she is look
ing forward to a circus time.
Piatt is no quitter. He will quit neither
the fight for Morton nor the right for pro
tection if Morton is defeated.
No matter how few or how many ballots
may be taken at St. Louis the nomination
vill be made by acclamation in the end.
The only thing on which any two Demo
crats can agree at this juncture is some
thing that can be opened with a corkscrew.
There is no longer any talk of a strad
dle at St. Louis, but it is agreed the
money plank shall be "diplomatically e.\
pre.âed."
The Vice-Presidency is the only thing
left to interest tlie betting men and the fel
lows who like to talk about what they
don't know.
The Russians may be pretty good at
coronation festivals, but we would like to
see them try to hold a convention to
nominate a Czar.
The Federal brigade at the Democratic
convention will be recognized by the
newly minted coin they will flash up when
they cross the bar.
Now is the time for Republicans to lay
aside all ttieir differences and dissensions.
It must be made a campaign of harmony
from the beginning.
It looks as if California Democrats
would have so much lighting during the
convention they will not feel like making
any during the campaign.
The sublime and the ridiculous of
A merican part y politics can be seen in the
contrast between the convention at St.
Louis and that at Sacramefito.
It seems the support of the favorites
was intended not so much as an opposi
tion to McKinley as a compliment to the
other fellows and their friends.
As soon as the Republican convention
has named its candidate for the Presi
dency, Grover Cleveland will cease to be
the biggest man in this country.
Patriotism, protection and prosperity
are already household words and with the
return to power of the Republican party
they will soon be household iactÂ«.
If Senator Teller is wise he will stay in
ihecamp. The only way to restore silver
to the position of a money metal is
through the medium of the Republican
party.
The Democrats at Sacramento might as
well give White a boom for the Presidency.
It won't hurt anything and will have the
advantage of enabling all (actions to make
a showing as white men.
Our reporta of the deliberations at St.
Louis and of the fracas at Sacramento
will be full, fair, impartial, accurate and
thoroughly comprehensive of every feature
of the proceedings of both events.
The special correspondents of The Call
at :-t. Louis and Sacramento are trained
journalists who will report the news fairly
and fully and not try to color it into lurid
literature for the sake of tjcusationalism.
OUR CONVENTION REPORTS
The occurrence of the Republican Na
tional Convention at St. Louis and the
Democratic State Convention at Sacra
mento at the same time affords The Call
an opportunity to show the excellence of
its news service and the impartiality with
which it speaks for all in recording the
events of the day.
The Call has a great advantage over
the other morning papers of this City in
the fact that it is the only one which re
ceives United Press dispatches. Of the
comparative merits of the United Press
and its rival, the Associated Press, it is
hardly necessary to speak. Over and over
again, in affairs so recent as to be within
the memory of all, the superiority of the
reports of the United Press, both as to
accuracy and as to fullness, has been de
monstrated beyond all controversy. A
new instance was given on Sunday, when
the Kcaminer published, with great display,
the report of a deluge in Ohio by which
200 lives were destroyed. The story was
without foundation. The United Press
heard the rumor as early as its rival, but
investigated the matter and found there
was no truth in it, while our contempo
rary was imposed on by the fake.
In i-onisequence of this accuracy which
marks its regular news service the reports
published in The Call can be read with
confidence and reliance. Our reports from
the conventions, howevsr, will not be con
lined to United Press dispatches. We
have a strong oorjls of artists and
special writers at both St. Louis and
Scraniento. The men who compose
our staff at either City are trained
journalists, experienced in political af
fairs, keenly observant of men and
events and accomplished writers, capable
of giving graphic, vivid, lifelike presenta
tions of every phase of the proceedings on
the streets, in committee meetings or iv
the conventions.
We can assure our readers as complete,
accurate and comprehensive reports of the
St. Louis convention as will be given by
any other paper in the world, and a better,
a fairer and a more impartial report than
will be found anywhere else of th<- conven
tion at Sacramento. The pressure of re
porting two events of such importance
and such popular interest occurring at the
same time will have no other effect than
that of rousing the energy of The Call to
accomplish a notable triumph in the work
of legitimate journalism, and we offer
what we have already done in this line as
evidence of what we will continue to do so
long as the conventions last.
The reader? of The Call will not have
to skim through columns of lurid line
writing iv order to see if, possibly, Borne
grain of news may be found in what is
played up as a sensation. Nor will they
have to pore over platitudes signed by
noted names in which the writers practice
the art of saying nothing at great length.
What is read in The Call will be the real
vital news of the day narrated by working
journalists who stand among the foremost
of the profession as news-gatherers aril as
news-writers. Our readers, therefore, will
get all the news and get It as accurately
and as tersely as it can be put together.
Thk Call not only speaks for ail, but
speaks it in a way that all can count on.
REPUBLICANS IN CONVENTION.
At 10 o'clock this morning, San Fran
cisco time, the eleventh Republican Na
tional Convention will be called to order,
and after prayer by Rabbi Seles the busi
ness in hand will be taken up and con
tinued until a candidate for President and
a candidate for Vice-President of the
United States are nominated. There is
great difference of opinion as to
how many days the convention will
be ijn session. Not a few believe that
the majority have such complete control
that one event will follow another in rapid
succession, as per a previously arranged
programme, and that delegates will be at
liberty to go home by to-morrow after
noon. There are others, however, who do
not believe the order of naming candidates
will be reached before Friday or Saturday,
but at this distance there does not appear
to be any reason why adjournment should
not be had some time to-morrow, unless
the committee on credentials is instructed
to go down to the merits of contests,
which it is not likely to do, although if it
does not it is likely to be severely censured
by not a few.
Presumably the gentlemen who shall
serve upon the platform committee are
already in possession of several declara
tions of principles, Dut, as we have already
said, the majority is so thoroughly organ
ized that most likely that submitted
will be accepted without much, if any, de
bate. The only danger that can be fore
seen is that the platform may not em
phasize enough the importance of making
the tariff question paramount. The
whole country is in distress because of the
weakness, or rather of the hostility, of the
present tariff law to our people, and
the people are desperately in earnest
in their demand for relief from the
destructive operation of that act. It cer
tainly is true that the monetary system of
the country needs revamping, but that
can wait until the stones that the Demo
cratic party has rolled in the way of all
business enterprises are rolled away. Cali
fornia regards the restoration of the act of
1890, or a law equally as favorable, as of
the greater importance to her industries,
and it is to be hoped that the convention
will not fail to reflect the sincere wish of
the people in its platform. Nothing would
so enthuse the people as to be assured that
the convention realizes the necessity for
putting our industries upon a safe basis at
the earliest day possible.
GIVE US PROTECTION FIRST
The more the money question is talked
about the mere the people are impressed
with the importance of letting it rest until
the present Joseph's coat kind of a tariff
law is repealed and one enacted that will
start up the country's idle industrial en
terprises and commercial agencies. It
would be like putting the cart before tne
horse to undertake to keep mill and fac
tory idle until a monetary system was
agreed upon. What the great working
class want, and want rieht away, is a mar
ket for their skill and brain. They have
been held in the slavery of idleness too
long already, and they are restless for
work. A weak and uncertain monetary
system can be endured until there is a de
mand for labor in all the avenues of em
ployment. There need be no fear that the
people will not take up the money ques
tion and settle ii, and settle it right, as
soon as they have profitable work, but
what does any kind of a monetary system
signify to the man who is living in en
forced idleness?
There are men and women by the tens
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 16, 1596.
of thousands who are praying for work,
and that at the earliest possible time, and,
as the voice of one man, they ask the Re
publican convention now in session at St.
Louis to set all other questions aside for
the moment and devise ways and means
that will insure a demand for their services.
They can have no money until they earn
it, and no kind of money would do them
good if they have no opportunity to earn
it. The present tariff act operates to fur
nish employment for the working people
of other countries at tne expense of our
own people. Only the blind man could
fail to see the importance of a protective
tariff enactment before any other issue is
considered. First give our idle thousands
an opportunity to go to work. Then they
will have the courage and the confidence
to sustain the Republican party upon
all the other economic and monetary
questions. There would be sense in dis
cussing a monetary problem with a man
who i.s earning money, but none whatever
with one who is denied opportunity to
earn money.
AT SACRAMENTO TO-DAY.
The bosses of the Democratic party of 1
California will assemble in Sacramento 10
-day in State Convention, and the proceed
ing will be unusually interesting because
of a lack of issues. Whenever that party
finds nothing to "declare" for, the time is
taken up in faction tights, and there will
be plenty of them on this occasion. The
free-silver men are already charging the
goldbugs with conspiring to disrupt the
party organization, and the Federal office
holders, who are goldites, of course, are
denouncing the silverites with conspiring
to lead the party into the Populist camp.
These two charges are quite enough to fur
nish an immense amount of amusement to
onlookers. It will De the purpose of. some
of the delegates to stir up strife, and since
no provision has been made for water to
quench the raging flames, or oil to pour on
the high-rolling billows of hatred, a Don
nybrook affair is sure to occur.
The Gould faction, which will be in the
majority in the convention, will be arro
gant and dictatorial, but if any one thinks
the Buckley following will take a backseat
until driven there let him go and look in
upon the convention. The party is bank
rupt so far as State issues are concerned,
and having not the remotest hope of car
rying the State, the convention will con
vert itself into a political laundry and de
vote its time to washing faction linen ; but
no matter which faction finally triumphs
there will be no soothing syrups or poul
tices for the bruised defeated. All blisters
will have to be healed according to that I
therapeutic theory that the hair of the
dog is good for the bite. It would be bet
ter every way if there were real live issues
for the convention to accept or reject ; but
there is not one except the money ques
tion, and that is one for the Chicago gath
ering to settle and not the Sacramento
convention. Still, that will be a good
enough red flag to intensify the existing
hatred which the several factions enter
tain for one another.
But in very many respects the proceed
ings of tnis convention will be decidedly
interesting. The fight between the Gould
and Buckley following will be sure to i
cause to be evolved very many things
which it would bs better for the few good
spots.in the party's record to have remain
under cover. An upheaval, however, is
inevitable, and that the public may have
the proceedings down to the smallest de
tail as clear and perfect as gifted pen and
reliable camera can join them The Call
will simply be unrivaled in its reports.
Our staff o[ descriptive writers and artists
.will be right in the center and on the out
skirts of the convention, and if you do not
see it in Thk Cam., why, it did not hap
pen, that's all. No doubt this convention
will go down in the history of the Demo
cratic party for clearness in revealing the
true inwardness of tbe methods and pur
poses of the party as no convention ever
did. .-

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
UNION OF SILVER FORCES.
i It Must Be Made at St. J.oas, .not at
â¢UIOAGO.
To the Kditor of the San Francisco Call- Sir:
Having given in my last letter conclusive rea
sons for holding that it is impossible for the
People's party or the Populists in National
Convention at St. Louis, July 22, to indorse the
candidates of the Democracy to be nominated
at Chicago, though they be well-known silver
men on an unconditional free silver platform,
â  it is now proposed to show how a compact and
solid union of all honest and earnest silver
men may be effected at St. Louis by the joint
action of the Populists and silverites in the
nomination of the same candidates on sepa
rate but not antagonistic platformsâ the silver
ites, as far as they go, to be in harmony with
the Populists on the joint issue of the money
question, and not the silver question alone.
In the first place, let us see just what the sil
verites have set forth as the basis for the or
ganization which they have named the Na
tional Silver party, as adopted at the founding
of the party in Washington, D. C, January 22,
189 G. The first declaration is in these words:
"The paramount issue at this time in the
I'm ted States is indisputably the money ques
tion. It is between the gold standard, gold
bonds and bank currency on the one side, and
the bimetallic standard, no bonds and Govern
ment currency on the other." â¢~"~
Thia declaration is in harmony with the
People's party platform adopted at Omaha,
July 4, 1892. But this new National silver
party further declares: "We hold that the
power to control and regulate a par currency
is inseparable from the power to coin money,
and hence that all currency intended to circu
late us money should be issued and its volume
controlled by the general Government, and
should be legal tender."
The Populist doctrine as to the issue of paper
money requires that such money shall be "Is
sued by the General Government only, and
shall be a full legal tender for all debts, public
and private." As the greater includes the lees,
I joir t candidates acceptable to the Populist
National Convention will necessarily indorse
the new Populist platform, which will not be
less explicit and broadly National than the
Omaha platform.
The other two planks in the platform of the
National Silver party call for the immediate
restoration of silver to free coinage and full
debt-paying power, and demand the payment
of all Coin obligations of the United States in
either gold or silver coin at the option of the
Government, as provided; in existing laws,
and not at the option of the creditor in gold,
allot which harmonizes with the Omaha'plat
form.
All honest and earnest silver men can cer
tainly stand on the platform of the National
Silver party, and he is a sanguine man who an
ticipates the adoption of such a platform by the
National Democracy at Chicago; hence genu
ine slyer men are not going to rush wildly into
their arms, even if they have faith to believe
i that the Democracy can be trusted. Moreover,
men are not familiar with politics in any
age or country, who suppose that Intelligent
and patriotic citizens are going to unite with
a divided and disintegrating party like the
Democracy of to-day which in so many great
States has practically become absorbed by the
People's party.
On the rapid disappearance of the Democracy
and the equally rapid growth of the People's
party it may be well to note a point or two. It
l-.as been aptly said that "the most conspicu
ous fact in the Oregon election is the insignifi
cant vote cast for the Democratic candidates,
ail of whom were for free silver. This ought
to indicate to the Democrats what is likely to
happen in the National election; they will
make a free-silver platform, and then have the
mortification of seeing the bait refused by the
voters, who will go to the Populist candidates."
This certainly gives a pretty strong hint as
to how the silver issue is likely to affect the
Democratic party, and as much so in other
States as in Oregon. Kansas was long a strong
Republican State and it is now almost cer
tainly Populist. Defections from tne Republi
can ranks are bound to increase rapidly in the
present campaign, as international bimetallism
is all that can be ho]>ed for at St. Louis this
week.
But international bimetallism is rather a
moldy chestnut for IS9G, as there arc several
millions of business men, and manufacturers
in particular, who hardly know how to keep
i their doors open without seeing the Sheriff en
j ter while they wait for customers, and these
I men "desire a change," even if it has to come
j with the aid of the "more money" People's
party; and then there are other "millions of
men out of a job. and not likely to find one,
who want something more substantial and sat
isfying after the election in November to take
home to their destitute wives and little ones
than this same old moldy chestnut of bimetal
lism, for which they have been waiting these
twenty years, and they, too, "aesire a change"
right soon, and are likely to vote the People's
party "more-money" ticket and see what will
come of it. None of these men will trust the
distracted, divided and decrepit Democratic
party, now fast disappearing before the Peo
ple's party, and look to a dying party to give
them prosperity instead of starvation.
Independent voters are likely to be numer
ous this year, and since they cannot trust De
mocracy, and Republicans can only offer them
international bimetallism in a close alliance
with, if not the dominance of. the gold men.
they are pretty sure to vote tor a change by
supporting the union ticket of the Populists
and Silverites.
In conclusion, it Is safe to say that only
such partisan free-silver Democrats as would
vote the party ticket with gold men as candi
dates, and the same class of Republican free
silver men, will hesitate to ally themselves
with the union ticket nominated by Populists
and Silverites at St. Louis, and as there can be
no hope whatever of electing the Democratic
candidates, all honest and earnest free-silver
men will vote the union ticket. All this will
be clear after the nominations are made.

HUDELSON SPEAKS.
I Denies Reported Attempt to Sell Out the
American Protective Association.
Ban Francisco, June 15, 189 G.
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sir: With
your permission I desire to spaak a few words
to the pnblic through your columns.
For some time the rumors have been going
the rounds that I have been guilty of selling
the American Protective Association to John
D. Spreckels for a money consideration, or en
tered into a bargain whereby said organiza
tion was to be sold and delivered; that I have
made the sale through C. M. Shortridge of the
San Francisco Call. In justice to myself and
the order I have the honor to preside over, as
State president, as well as C. M. Shortridge
and J. D. Spreckels, I feel called upon
to brand the charges and rumors
above referred to as infamous in their
conception and absolutely and unqualifiedly
false. I have never met Mr. V. M. Shortridge
and do not know him even by sight. I have
never met Mr. J. h. Spretksls to exceed three
times, and then other honorable gentlemen
have been present, and lam willing that every
word spoken by that gentleman or myself at
these times of meeting should be published to
the world. 1 have made no political combina
tion with Mr. Spreckels nor he with me, nor
has there ever been v political combination
talked about between us, nor hns any one had
authority from me to make any political com
bination whatever with Mr. Spreckels or any
other person, nor am I in a position as State
pregidentof the American Protective Associ
ation to make any political combination what
ever.
That I was threatened with ruin if. I did not
lend my influence in securing $55,000 from
Mr. Spreckels for certain parties in the City of
San Francisco on what I believed then, and be
lieve now, to be a "gold brick" proposition is
true. That I indignantly spurned such a propo
sition, branded the party who made it as beini?
connected with an attempt at extortion, and
defied them to lay on and do their Worst, is
also true, and the reason that 1 am now being
branded by these conspirators is because I
spurned their proposition and when the time
comes for me to give to the pnblic the facts;
and lay before them the evidence in my pos
session, there will be a rattling of dry bones
and one of the blackest conspiracies that has
ever been entered into will be unearthed and
the conspirators held up before the public for
the execration they so richly deserve.
I most respectfully ask tlie public to with
hold judgment until both sides have had a
hearing, and the reason that I do not give the
evidence and all the facts at the orefent time
is that an investigation within tbe organiza
tion that I have the honor to preside over is
now being carried on. Respectfully,
B. K. Hvdelson.

COLORED GLASS BOTTLES
Judge Morrow Kenden a Decision a*
to the I > 1 1 1 v on Pints and
Quarters.
Judge Morrow of the United States Dis
trict Court handed down an opinion yes
terday affecting every importer of colored
glass botties in the United States. The
suit in question was an appeal made by
W. R. Grace & Co. from a decision of the
General Board of Appraisers in the matter
of duty on 14.400 pint bottles imported by
tbe appellants.
Collector Wise held that the bottles were
subject to a duty of l] 4 cents per pound as
provided for by paragraph 88 of the Wil
son bill. The case was carried to the Gen
eral Board of Appraisers and the Collec
tor sustained on the ground that they
came under the provision 0/ the act regu
lating the duty on bottles not larger than
one pint and not less than one-quarter of
a pint. In other words they were vials
within the meaning and intent of the law.
Grace & Co. held that the bottles were
not vials and were not: known as such.
They should have been dutiable either un
der the section providing for "other col
ored bottles" with an ad valorem duty of
40 per centum or classed as "other colored
glass bottles not named in this act" and
subject to a duty of % of 1 cent per pound.
Judge Morrow reviewed the section
fully, reaching the conclusion that bottles
of the cnaracter named â¢w^re subject to a
duty of 1% cents per pound.

WORKS TO DEFEND
FRENCH FORESTS
Pierre Boissaye Is Here
on a Government
Mission.
THE EFFECT OF FIRES.
Has Two Thousand Men Under
Him to Protect Timber
in France.
EXACTING KTJLES ENFORCED.
Will Complete a Trip Around the
World and Observe Forest
Growths.
Pierre Boissaye, general guard of the
forests of France, arrived here yesterday
on a special trip around the world to ex
amine different forest conditions for the
French Government. What his position
signifies may be inferred from the fact
that he has under him between 1500 ana
1800 men and 450 officers, who care for the
timber lands and protect them from depre
dations and forest fires.
He says ih&t there are 350,000 square
miles of forest lands in France and 100,000
square miles of beautiful timber lands in
the French possessions in Africa. The
Government owns one-third of all forest
districts and exercises complete control
over all the remainder. No trees or tim
ber can be cut or destroyed, even by the
private owners, without a permit from tbe
Government, and if the Government does
not see fit to grant the permit that settles
the matter. To cause a forest fire is a
crime punishable by life imprisonment.
Consequently, forest fires are very rare.
M. Boissaye arrived in America in
March, but has spent most of his time in
the Canadian forests. He mentioned with
regret the vast areas of fire-swept timber
he saw along the Canadian Pacific .Rail
road.
One of the purposes of the trip is to learn
how long it talces a forest to revive and
practically to reproduce itself after being
burned.
He purposes to visit the different big
tree groups in this State before starting for
Japan. From the empire of the Mikado
he will go to the French possessions in
China and thence to Ceylor, and finally
pay a short visit to Africa before returning
to bis headquarters in Nice, where he
hopes to arrive about October.
M. Boissaye is a man probably not more
than 30 years of age, and wears a full,
round beard and close-cropped hair. He
is staying at the Grand.
LADY'S TEA GOWN.
This model is much Hked because it admits
of charming combinations and is the ideal
way to use such graceful stuffs as liberty silk
or satin chiffon, silk crepe, etc.
The front of the gown itself hangs loose from
the neck, unconfined by darts. The full front
is also simply straight from the neck, and may
be worn loose or confined by a ribbon. The
bishop sleeve and sailor collar are becoming
and stylish features. A gown of black silk
checked with lines of green had a green chif
fon front, with collar of black mousseline de
soie with appliqued lace braid.
A gown of blue and white challie had a white
lawn front with tiny ruffles of Valenciennes
lace set on crosswise about two inches apart. A
collar of white lawn finished this charmingly
cool and dainty gown.
A green crepon with collar and loose front
of pesu de soie was very handsome. White
chiffon ruffles finished the edges of the collar.
IN THE REDWOODS.
A Trip for People Who Enjoy a Quiet,
Kespectable Outing.
Next Sunday the first passenger train to
enter Bohemian Grove on the Russian
River, three miles below Guerneville, vi ill
be a special chartered by J. E. Locke, on
which occasion that gentleman will take
the ladies and gentlemen of this City and
suburbs who enjoy a quiet, respectable
outing into one of the most attractive re
gions within a day's travel of the metropo
lis. It is the grove of big redwoods se
lected by the Bohemian Oiub for its annual
"high jinks." and from this fact its name
is derived. i
A more charming locality for a day's
outing could not be selected. To this is
added the additional feature of reserving
seats on the train for the round trip, in
the same manner as theater seats are re
served, which avoids the rush ana confu
sion which always attend the departure
of the ordinary excursion train. At the
same time the rate for the trip has been
put away down to $125, with a half-rate
for children under 12 years of age.
Mr. Locke arranges his excursions with
the special object of drawing out into the
country the nicest people in the City, and
his success has been remarkable. He ca
ters to ladies and gentlemen who are not
satisfied with the old-style Sunday picnic
and has introduced his modern high-grade
excursion' for their benefit. Tickets are to
be obtained only at his office and resi
dence, . 333 O'Farrell street, from 1 to 9
p. m. daily. In case the limit of the train
is not reached by Saturday ; night, a lim
ited number of unreserved seat tickets will
be sold by him at the ferry Sunday morn
ing, but under no circumstances can tick
ets be obtained except upon personal ap
plication to Mr. Locke. By pursuing this
course the character of the people attend- !
ing is known and the interests of his pa
trons are protected.

The Palaces of Millionaires.
Millionaires are generally supposed to
be very superstitious; but if the fear of
ill-fortune were to deter any of the tribe
from erecting stately houses in. London,
he would certainly be justified by prece
dent. To take a few cases. The downfall
of Hudson, the rail .vay king, followed on
his beginning to build a house for him
self which should eclipse all others.
Baron Albert Grant never got further
than the foundations of tbe palace which
he intended to have named Kensington
Court. Mr. Sanford had hardly rebuilt
the interior of his house in Carlton House
Terrace when "Argentines" went down
and he was obliged to sell it to Mrs.
Mackay. The completion of Lord Revel
stoke's palace in Charles street coincided
with the Baring crisis, and it has been to
let ever since. Lord Kosebery rebuilt his
house just in time to enable him to occupy
it on the collapse of the Government.
Now the disasters which have fallen on
the Chartered Company coincide with the
completion of the external structure of
Mr. Beit's mansion in Park Lane.â -St.
James Gazette.
One of the painful episodes of the Paris Com
mune, the shooting of Monsiguore Darboy,

LUMBER A DRUG
IN THE MARKET
Many Schooners in Mission
Bay Awaiting a Chance
to Discharge.
FREIGHT RATE REDUCED
Owners of Vessels Cannot Make
Any Money So They Will
Tie Them Up.
WERE DROWNED IN MID-OCEAN
Two of the Crew of the Schooner
Vesta Washed From the
Spanker Boom.
Lumbermen are getting very much con
cerned over the dullness of trade. All the
yards are full and there is no demand, as
very few wooden buildings are going up.
At the present time there are at least naif
a dozen laden schooners in Mission Bay
and three or four more which were there
last week have unloaded their cargoes
onto scows and tied up in Oakland Creek.
As soon as the others can get rid of their
loads they also will follow suit, as it does
not pay to carry lumber here from coast
ports any more.
A month ago the ruling rate was $3 50
per thousand feet, and at that figure own
ers of sailing vessels could pay expenses
and make a living. When dull times came
ihe rate was cut to $3, but still the vessels
worked on. A few days ago another cut of
25 cents was made, and before the end of
the month the rate may be $2 50 per thou
sand feet. In consequence all the fleet is
being laid up, and by the Fourth of July
Oakland Creek will probably have fifteen or
twenty schooners on its mudflats. Sailors
who left deep-water ships to go "coasting"
are now only too glad to get back on any
outward bound ship that is short of men.
The lumber fleet in Mission Bay has been
tying there nearly a week waiting an op
portunity to discharge their cargoes.
The barkentine Sharpshooter got away
on her Australian journey yesterday.
Everything is now shipshape and her
owners are confident that she will make a
quick passage. Just before sailing time
Second Mate E. Roberts fell from the poop
to the main deck and broke his arm. He
was sent ashore and the arm set. Another
mate was secured and the vessel put to
sea. The men who deserted from the
barkentine when she put back last week
say they had good cause for leaving the
vessel. Accordine to them they never
had a "watch below" from the time the
Sharpshooter left San Francisco until they
got back again, three days later. They
deny having filled tbe boat with sand and
say she was in good condition when they
left her near tne old Seiby Smelting
Works.
The cruiser Philadelphia and monitor
Monadnoct sailed for Santa Cruz yester
day. They will participate in the water
carnival and after that wilt return to San
Francisco for the glorious Fourth.
Another attempt to raise the Blairmore
will be made this morning. After Sun
day's disastrous failure the men took a
rest, and the only work done yesterday
was in the nature of repairing damages.
The big mooring anchor was raised, and
the Whitelaw was moved so as to be in line
with the sunken ship. New hawsers were
bent and the air-hoÂ«e repaired. The Brit
ish ship Ellisland was moved out of the
way, and a new pump was placed in posi
tion. Captain Burns will see that every
thing is in eood working order, and then
the pumps, wreefcer and tugs will make
one more attempt to raise the vessel.
A new schooner for the lumber trade
was launched at Fairhaven yesterday.
She was christened the Albert Meyer, and
will carry 600,000 feet of lumber.
The schooner Vesta from Hueneme for
Port Blakeley 10-t two of her crew over
board. Second Mate Johnson and a sailor
named Jorgensen were knocked off the
spanker-boom daring the night, and were
lost in tbe darkness. The vessel was
hove to, but the men were never seen
again.
TRINITY IS ACCREDITED.
Unintentionally Omitted From the Pub
lished List of Schools Recognized
by the State University.
Through an error of the printer Trinity
School of this City was omitted from the
published list of schools accredited by the
University of California for the present
year.
Secretary Bonte of the university upon
discovering the error sent to Rev. E. B.
Spnlding, rector of Trinity School, a letter
explaining how the omission came to be
made.
Trinity School has long stood so nigh
among the secondary schools of the State
that the unintentional omission would
doubtless surprise many who do not know
that it was due to a mistake. Over a
hundred graduates have left the school,
half of whom have entered universities
here and in the East.
The school was one of the firsc of pri
| vate schools to be accredited and isrankeJ
very high in scholarship by the academic
council of the University of California.
COUPER LOSES HIS SUIT.
Difficnltie* That Arose From the Prod-
uct of an Oregon Farm.
Judges Hawley, Koss and Gilbert of the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals
1 banded down a decision yesterday affect
ing the right of a court to appoint a re
ceiver on mortgaged property, even though
such a condition was named in the mort
gage at the time it was executed.
On Marcn 26, 1894, William Thompson
brought suit in the Circuit Court of Ore
gon to foreclose a mortgage on farming
lards given by James Q. Shirley, to secure
payment of two promissory notes of $10,000
each. It was stipulated in this particular
contract that tne court might, on motion
of the mortgagee, appoint a rec- iver to col
lect the rents during the pendency of fore
closure. E. J. Couper was named by the
mortgagee as receiver, and proceeded to
fulfill the duties of his office. When he
made his returns, however, the court held
tnat bis appointment, regardless of the
fact that the mortgaee permitted it, was
against the laws of the State, and conse
quently he was not entitled to receive any
compensation for the services performed.
Couper appealed the case, the Court of
Appeals, as previously stated, upholding
the decision of the lower tribunal. Couper
will now have to look to the mortgagee for
his money.

Charged With Battery.
James A. Maloney, a well-dressed man
32 years of age, who says he is a commer

Marset street by Policeman Coleman on
the charge of battery.
The complaining witness against him
was Alice Hendricks, a pretty girl 16 years
of age, employed in a candy-store on
Kearny street. She said she was on her
way home from the store, and on turning
into Market street Maloney accosted her
and asked her to have dinner with him.
She spurned his offer and walked on.
Maloney followed her and bumped ud
against her and again asked her to have
dinner with him.
She felt bo indignant that she hunted
for a policeman and met Coleoian. She
told him what bad occurred and that she
wanted Maloney arrested. Coleman
placed him under arrest and took him to
the prison, accompanied by the girl.
Maloney declined to make any statement.
He said he had been drinking heavily for
the past five days.

WARNED NOT TO
MOVE TOO FAST
The Fourth of July Com
mittee Not to Make too
Many Contracts
TILL COIN IS IN VIEW.
A Discussion on the Subject of
Fireworks and One in Re
gard to a Regatta.
LETTER TO THE GRAND ARMY.
Chi dren and Floats in the Parade.
Native Sons to Take PartâCol
lections to Date.
At the meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Fourth of July committee
last evening it was announced that up to
Friday evening $1600 had been collected,
i and it was decided to dispense with paid
collectors in the future and have volunteer
collectors. Messrs. Lent. Umbsen and
Truman will collect from the real estate
men. S. C. Hammond was appointed to
collect lrom the butchers.
The literary committee will reduce psti
mated expenses $80 by having but sixteen
instead of thirty-two musicians.
The parade committee reported that it
had prepared a letter to be sent to each
post of the Grand Army of the Republic,
and the letter, which was in the following
words, was approved :
The Fourth of July celebration committee is
informed that a statement is being circulated
to the effect that it is the intention of the com
mittee to prohibit any float or feature repre
senting the period of the Civil War entering
the parade.
We not only emphatically deny this rumor
and insist it is without the slightest founda
tion in fact, but take pleasure in extending to
all posts of the Grand Army of the Republic
and kindred organizations a special invitation
to enter floats in the Fourth of July parade
commemorative of the deeds of those noble
heroes who offered up their lives for the
preservation of our country, whose birthday
we are about to celebrate.
The same committee announced that
160 men would turn out in the "Con
tinental Army" and that it would require
i $430 for expenses. The amount was al
lowed.
The Veteran Firemen were allowed $50
toward payine the expenses of their band.
The decoration committee reported that
| to illuminate the City by electricity would
cost from $6000 to $15,000, so the idea
had been abandoned. This committee
also reported that it had called a meeting
of merchants for to-night to discuss the
matter of decoration and fireworks.
The matter of having or not having set
pieces of fireworks or merely bombs and
rockets evoked a long discussion, and the
matter went over till Thursday night.
One member thought the raiiroad com
panies should have a voice in saying where
the fireworks should be displayed, as upon
the choice of location the amount of con
tributions would depend.
"Yes," said another member, "it is a
question of profit for the company. Are
we to consult the railroad companies or
the public in this matter?"
The music committee reported that it
was impossible to give an estimate as to
the cost of music until it is known how
many bands' shall be needed. It was
estimated that twelve bands woild cost
about $1260. The Musicians' Union, it
was stated, had agreed that non-union
men should be permitted to play with
union men.
Ohairman King suggested that the com
mittee should be careful not to enter into
contracts before it knew how much money
it could obtain.
The regatta committee stated it would
require about $250.
Mr. Hallidie of the literary committee
announced that the prize poems are
coming in so fast that the members will
be at a loss to make a choice.
The regatta committee presented a re
port as to the class of boats to take part
and that about $800 should be devoted for
prizes.
Mr. Hal lidie thought that the expendi
ture of money for regattas is money
thrown into the water, as such detracts
from the celebration on shore.
Mr. Elder said that if there is any objec
tion to the regatta the committee can cut
it off as one of the features of the day.
Secretary Smith suggested that a com
mittee should be appointed to see whether
tbe amount necessary can be obtained on
the water front.
Chairman King warned all committees
to go slow in the matter of making de
mands for money, "for," said he, "if you
look In any direction $1000 or $800 stares
you in the face with no money in sight'
The regatta committee was instructed to
ascertain if the water front people will pay
for a regatta.
Mr. Lent suggested the appointment of
a fireworks committee of five, and by a 4 to
3 vote, many of the members not voting,
such a committee was declared necessary.
Mr. Lent then offered the following
named as the committee: W. W. Shan
non, Robert Ash, R. B. Moore, Frank
Shea and W. T. Gallway.
Grand Marshal Umbsen suggested the
schools make an effort to gain the banners
offered in prizes for the best floats in the
procession.
The teacher? will meet the grand mar
shal this afternoon to take some action in
regard to the school display.
This evening the Native Sons will meet
the grand marshal to make arrangements
for the parade.
The committee will meet again Thurs
day night to discuss finance.
It has been suggested that the patriotic
picture of the first American flag, pub
lished in The Call last Sunday, be repro
duced on a float in the Fourth of July
parade.
CARDONA NOT GUILTY.
Verdict of a Jury in Judge Belcher's
Court.
The trial of Leo de Cardona, formerly
assistant bookkeeper in the office of the

felony, committed in raining the amounts
in demand warrants payable to laborers.
was held before a jury in Judge Belcher's
court yesterday.
The case was given to the jury at 4:30

verdict of not guilty on account of vari
ances. On the first ballot the jury stood
7 to 5.

Bow to Be Comfortable
Some Hints From a. Scientific Sourer
.. ;'. About Hot , Weather. . .
Hot weather Invariably causes sickness and
makes even the strongest people feel weak
languid and worn ! out; there is, however, â¢ .
way to keep cool, strong, healthy and well in
even the hottest weather, as thousands of men
and women can testify from practical experi
ence. Every person who values health and
strength will do well to follow their" example
and carefully read the following opinions 03
the subject :
J. F. Clark, M.D., of Reidsville, N. C. says:
"At this season of the year I rind Duffy's pure
malt whisky extremely beneficial as atonic,
stimulant and appetizer. I can recommend it
to the debilitated for its medicinal qualities."
| Mrs. R. G. Schiede, 1231 Parish street, Phila-
i delphia, says: "I have been using Duffy's pure
malt whisky and find that it has not only im-
proved my appetite but greatly increased my
strength."
"Mrs. F. P. Haviland, 7 West One Hundred
and Nineteenth street, New York, says: "I
have used Duffy's pure mait whisky with great
benefit. It has given me strength, good appe-
tite and cured sleeplessness, irom which I suf-
fered."
The above opinions clearly prove that the
best way to keep strong and healthy in hot
weather is by using a pure stimulant' to assist
nature. They also prove b>yohd question that
the purest and safest stimulant to take is Duf-
fy's pure malt whisky, because it never fails to
give new life, tone . and strength to every part
of the body. It is refreshing, strengthening,
health-giving, and there is nothing better for
people who feel weary and languid in summer
weather. In purchasing from your grocer or
druggist, however, be sure you get Duffy's pure
malt and nothing else. Insist on having \rhat
you ask for and accept no inferior imitation.

TWO "JIMS" IN THE
HANDBALL COURT
Corbett Defeats the Pride
of the Occidental
Club.
J. C. NEALON'S WATERLOO
He Falls an Easy Victim to
the Champion Among
Pugilists.
BEST TWO G&MES IN THREE.
Hampton, the Coast's Bast Man, Was
Also Defeated Two Exciting
Games in Four.
James C. Nealon, the "pet" of the Occi
dental Handball Club, and one of the best
players of that exciting game on this
coast, had a few tail feathers plucked out
of him Sunday by James J. Corbett, the
champion pugilist of the world.
To say that Nealon is crestfallen would
be putting it lightly. He is actually,
though unreasonably, humiliated.
Corbett does not profess to be a hand
ball player, and he indulges in that sport
only for exercise preparatory to his com
ing match with Tom Sharkey.
He usually devotes an hour or so each
morning between sparring with his train
ers and punching the bag to chasing the
small and hard handball. Already he has
met nearly every man in the Olympic Club
who Knows anything of the game, and
when he learned that his old friend, James
Nealon, was a master in that line he
eagerly accepted a den' to meet him.
Nealon rode downtown early on a
Hayes-street car and passing the residence
of P. J. Corbett, Champion Jim's father,
he saw the old gentleman on the side
walk.
'Come along with us!" he shouted.
"Come along, Mr. Corbett. Jim and I are
going to have a game of handball."
Mr. Corbett shook his head and Nealon
turned to his friend and fellow-balltosser,
JacK Bonnet, saying:
"The old gentleman don't want to see
me do Jim up."
"I didn't like very much to hear myself
talk," Champicn Jim said yesterday after
noon, "but Nealou did string me out in
great shape. I was afraid to open my |
mouth, he seemed to know he had things
so much his own way. But i stuck to him
and at the end of the first game, although
he beat me by a score of 16 to 21, I saw I
could get away with him in the best two
out of three.
"Oh! but didn't I begin to string him,
though? I felt I had him going and you
bet 1 made him suffer for the hammering
he gave me at the start.
"Jim Nealon is a very fast and good
player, I'll admit, but I managed to out- j
last him all right. ' v i
"In the second game he only scored
twelve and in the tnird he only scored j
fourteen points to my twenty How
is that for my friend Nealon who wanted
the old man to come and see him wipe the
court up with me?"
Of course, something was wrong with
James Neaion, the Occcidental Club's
crackerjack. The ball was a shade too
soft or a trifle too hard. He has not yet
declared himself which as yet, but in the
challenge he intends soon to issue for a
return match his ideas will be made clear.
Yesterday morning Jim Corbett played
a tie match, two to two, against Albert
Hampton, the amateur champion hand
ball player of the State.
The games took place in the Olympic
Club court, Hampton winning the first
two and losing the two last," said Corbett.
"I had Hampton plumb tired out when
we quit, and 1 actually think I could have
beaten him in the filth game, but 1 felt
I'd tire myself too much and would get no
benefit out of ray boxing bouts.
"1 will confess, on the quiet, that I did j
play a little 'dirty ball' against Hampton
in the last game. He's as lively as a cat,
and I told him be could not expect me to
keep out of his way nil the time." As
Corbett related this he laughed heartily.
illustrating how he doubled himself up at
times so as to force Hampton to run
around him.
"Hampton is a dandy player," the cham
pion continued, "and I want to have
some more games with him. I promise
I'll play good ball. But sure with Nealon
I played nice, clean ball, and I beat him
on my merits."
REDROOM CITY INQUEST
Southern Pacific Carelessness the Cause
of a Ueath.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., June 15.â The
entire day has been consumed in the tak
ing of testimony before the Coroner's jury
in the inquest upon the body of Ludwig
Petersen, who was struck by a southbound
train on Saturday noon. The verdict ex
onerates the engineer and trainmen from
all blame, but finds the Southern Pacific
Company guilty of rnlpable carelessness
through its inefficient rules and regula
tions, which do not provide for proper
safeguards at crossings or warning of the
approach of trains. Petersen leave a crip
plea widow and four children.
REDROOD`S AGED CONTENT
William Jones Is Sent to San Quentin
for Fourteen Tears.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., June 15.â
William. Jones was convicted to-day of as
sault upon Henry Koop with intent to
commit robbery. The crime was com
mitted near Woodside. in this county, in
July, 1894. He waived time and was ai
once sentenced to fourteen years at San
Quentin. He is 65 years old, with a record
of one prior term at San Quentin for grand
larceny from Santa Clara County.
Denounced by an Alaska Judge.
SEATTLE, Waph., June 15.â Hon. A.
K. Delaney, United States District Judge
for Alaska, defended Frank Fuller when
on trial for the murder of Bishop Seghers
nine years ago. Upon being told to-day
that Fuller had, with his liberation some
weeks since, made a confession to the ef
fect that a woman was the cause of the
trouble, he remarked;
"It is a lie made out of whole cloth, and
there was not a word of evidence in the
whole trial to support the statement."
Gold for iakima Indians.
SEATTLE, Wash., June 15.â Eighteen
tribes comprising the Yakima nation nave
called upon Federal Judge Hanford to de
cide what disposition shall be made of
$20,000 awarded the Indians some years
ago by the Government for the Wenatch
apan fishery on the forks of the Pisquouse
and Wenatchapan rivers. The majority
of the tribes want the money- expended in
the construction of an irrigation canal,
but the others object.
EQVAX. SVFFHAGISTS IS STOCKTOS
Ladies Tell Some of Their Experiences
While. Canvassing for Xatnes.
STOCKTON, Cal., June 15.â The Equal
Suffrage Club, presided over by Mrs.
Sarah C. Harry, met at 2 o'clock this
afternoon in regular weekly session.
There was a good attendance present and
the usual enthusiasm over the work and
progress which Is daily being made was
shown. In addition to the members of
the club a number of strangers interested
in the work were noticeable in the gath
ering.
An interesting feature of the meeting
was the recital of their experiences by the
ladies who canvassed the city for signa
tures to a petition framed to ascertain the
public sentiment in reference to the elev
enth amendment which it is proposed to
submit to the voters at the next election.
Many interesting and amusing experi
ences were met with. Nearly all the can
vassers told of men who were perfectly
astonished when told of the eleventh
amendment. They had never heard of it.
The manual was then taken up and the
weekly chapter was gone through with.
The prayer at the beginning of each lesson
is omitted, for the reason that the club is
entirely non-religious. The meetings are
public, contrary to what some imagine,
and all, both ladies and gentlemen, are
invited to be present.
ANOTHER FALSE SCENT
Sheriff Plummer of San Jose
Pays an Important Visit
to Stockton.
Ha Thought Some Letters He Received
Were Frcm Murderer Dun
ham's Brother.
STOCKTON, Cal., June 15. â Special
Deputy Sheriff Plummer has been here for
the past two days looking up a clew that
the officers of the Garden City had as to j
the whereabouts ol Dunham. The Sheriff \
of Santa Clara County recently received
three letters from the vicinity of WTooc
bridge, in this county, telling him that the
writer was sure that one of the men in the !
covered rig that passed through here last j
week, and which was thought at the time
by some of the residents of Woodbridge to I
contain Dunham, was none other than the j
much- wanted Santa Clara murderer. It
was not thought by the officers that the
man was Dunham, but it was suspected
by them that the letters were being writ
ten by some friend of the murderer to
throw the officers off the scent.
Plummer came here several days ago, j
and has since thorouchly investigated the
matter. The writer of the letters was
found to be a very estimable lady who
Jives at Woodbridge and who is highJy j
connected. She was so certain that the 1
man in the rig sbe saw was Dunham that i
she wrote the three letters that stirred up
the Sheriff's office at San Jose.
What made the officers there more
certain that some job was being put up on j
them was the resemblance of the writing !
to that of Dunham's brother, who is now
going to school at San Jose. The letters
were shown to a Mr. Williams, for whom
Dunham's brother once worked, and he
was very positive in his belief that they
were written by the brother of the mur
derer and sent to some friend at Wood
bnge for mailing. This theory has been i
exploded by the special officer's visit to !
t.at place.
In converration this morning Mr. Plum
mer said that the day before Dunham
committed the murders on the McGlincey j
place tht.t he drew $1000 from the bank.
It is thought that he was negotiating to
get more money, as he was endeavoring [
to realize on some mortgages that he held, j
but could not do so in time for the crime j
he committed. Dunham, according to j
Mr. Plummer, is one of the best shots with |
a pistol in tl>e country. Frequently he j
would buy $5 or $0 worth of cartridges with !
which to practice with his revolver. When
be left he had at least two pistols that the
officers know of, and the bullets with
which his relatives were slain show that j
guns of different caliber were used for the
killing.
Mr. Plummer's mission has been fruit
less, except for the fact that he can set the
minds of his fellow-workers in the chase
after Durham at rest about the writer of
the letters from this county.
ON TRIAL IN PORTLAND
Highwayman Lee Oliver Makes an At
tempt to Establish an Alibi.
PORTLAND, Or.. June 15.âHighway
man Lee Oliver occupied the witness
stand in his own defense this afternoon in
the trial of the Klamath stage-robbery
case. He tried his best to establish an
alibi, saying he was miles away from the
scene of the hold-up when it was in
progress. Robert Oliver, the prisoner's
brother, testified that on the night of
December 4, when the stare was robbed,
Lee came to his house and that the latter
had no pistol nor was there one aoout the
premises. James George testified that
Oliver was with him on the 3d of Decem
ber, driving cattle at his lanch. The trial
will be concluded to-morrow.
THE MONTERSE CARNIVAL
A Genuine null-Fight May Be Added to
the Programme.
MONTEREY, Cal., June 15. - The
"Adobe City" has during the past few
days assumed a very gala appearance.
Decorators and painters are hard at work
and also large forces of carpenters. There
is talk of having a regular Mexican bull
fight on one of the celebration days. Thi3
feature will greatly add to the attraction
of the carnival. There has been a change
made regarding the appointing of a Queen
and the ballots are now open. A lively
fight is being made among the many fac
tions of Monterey to elect their Queen.
Thus far Miss Fanny Bostrom is in the
lead and Miss Florence Schaufie second.

HE KISSED UNDER
THREATS OF DEATH
Howard Armstrong's Bold
Osculation Before a
Mad Husband.
IT WAS NOT FOR LOVE.
Frederick Saunders Watched
Him Kiss Mrs. Saunders
Twice.
AND THEN GOT A BEVOLVER.
The Insulted Husband Declares It Is
a Plot to Drive Him Out
of His House.
What can be done to a man who kisses
another man's wife in his presence and
against his protests is a question now puz
zling Frederick Saunders, proprietor of
the Sunny Delaware lodging-house, 1151
Market street.
Saunders is an Englishman about 50
years of age. He appeared in Judge Con
lan's court yesterday morning. He was
laboring under suppressed excitement and
asked Warrant Clerk Seaman if he could
get a warrant for the arrest of a man for
kissing his wife. It was suggested that
the only way would be for his wife to
swear to the complaint, but he said she
would never do it. He went away mut
tering threats against the kisser.
Saunders was seen later at the lodging
house. He was talking in an excited
manner to Attorney Schilling, who has
been employed by his wife to bring suit
against him and others to prevent them
from doing away with any of the property
in the lodging-house.
"Who is the man that kissed my wife?"
he queried in answer to a question. "His
name is Howard Armstrong, and he and
his wife have been living in my house
against my protests. He and his wife in
stigated my wife to bring a suit for di
vorco against me in Judge Hunt's court,
which was dismissed about three weeks
ago. .Now they are trying to help my
wife get possession of this place and drive
me out.
"On Friday evening Armstrong deliber
ately kissed my wife at the top of the
stairs in presence of me and my daughter.
It could not have been for love, as he is a
young man and she is over 50, but it was
done as part of the plot to get me out of
the house. lam not a strong man and
would have no chance with him in a per
sonal encounter, so I could do nothing to
resent the insult. 1 told him that if he
ever attempted to kiss her again I would
bore him full of holes, and I will."
Just then Armstrong brushed past, and
Saunder? said, pointing his linger at him,
"There's the man who kissed my wife. If
he ever does it again 1 will fill him full of
lead. Yes I will," he yelled after Arm
strong, who disappeared along the
haliway.
"We leased this house about a year ago,"
continued Saunders, "and I furnished it
at a cost of $4000, but there is a chattel
mortgage on it for $1000. My wife managed
against my will to get the lease in her
name, and ever since, backed by the Arm
strongs, she has been trying to get full
possession of the furniture and other
effects. The divorce was the first step, and
now that that has failed she has got three
different attorneys to do something to at
tain her end.
"Although living in the same house we
might as well be thousands of miles from
each other. Just look at the room she
makes me live in. It hasn't been dusted
or swept out for months, all with the pur
pose of driving me out, but she.can't doit.
This thing has got to be arbitratjd, and I
must have my rights.
"I never before carried a revolver, but
since Armstrong kissed my wife I have
bought one, and if he evsr dares to kiss lier
again I will use it upon him. Here it is,"
and he pulled a revolver out of a drawer
in bis bureau.
"We have five children," he said, "two
sons and three daughters. Our eldest
daughter is married, and she and her hus
band live upon us against my wishes. My
wife has got them all against me, but I am
going to stay right here." *
Adout 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon
Saunders was arrested upon a warrant
sworn out in Judge Con Jan's court by Arm
strong, charging Dim with threats against
life. He said he was glad the matter would
be taken into court, as the truth would
come out. Before being arrested he was
served with a copy of the complaint in the
suit brought by his wife to prevent him
doing away with any of the property in
the lodging-house. The other defendants
in the suit are A. D. Wunder, agent for the
creditors; G. Miller & Son, McVicker &
Broderick, T. A. Barrs, 8. Soloman, B. V.
Dureen, creditors; Frederick Saunders Jr.,
and E. C. Cordell, attorney for Saunders.
SAN JOSE'S WILL CONTEST
Reading of Depositions and
Letters Written by the
Testator.
The Contestant Denounced as a Slan
derer and a Woman of Bad
Moral Character.
SAN JOSE, Cal., June 15.â The hearing
of the Parker will contest was resumed in
Judge Reynolds' court this morning. The
entire day was occupied in reading deposi-
I tions and letters written by George Parker,
the testator, to his sister, Jane Pomeroy.
Throughout all the letters Parker expressed
j a dislike for his son's wife, Emma L.
ParkÂ°r, the contestant of the will. He
mentioned her habit of making lying and
slanderous statements, her extravagance
and bad moral character.
The deposition of Jane Pomeroy was
read. The deponent said that she always
tried to keep Edward Parker's dissipated
habits from his father, but the latter found
out for himself. At the time of his pon's
sickness George Parker sent his son $300,
for him to take a trip to the Bermudas, at
i her request. During his, last visit East in
I 1893 George Parker seemed to be vigorous
in mind and body.
A letter written by Emma L. Parker,
j the contestant, to George H. Parker, in
which !>he told of Edward's serious illness
and asked for financial help, was put in
evidence.
Six letters, written by George H. Parker
to Jane Pomeroy, were read and offered
as evidence. They were written in Decem
ber, 1892. and March, April and May, 1893.
In them Park-r speaks in the worst possible
terms of his son's wife, Emma. He com
plains of the lies that Emma Parker
circulating with regard to his and Jane's
treatment of Edward. Parker said he
would have stood by his son's wife if she
had only told the truth about her past
life. Emma Parker had induced a Mr.
Bill of New York to write George Parker a
[ very strong letter calling for financial as
| sistance on account of Edward Parker s
I sickness. He asked Jane Pomeroy to write
i Mr. Bill of New York, the wholesaler who
I supplied Edward Parker with hats and
caps, the true state of the case. George
Parker suggested that something be done
to inform tiie public that he and Jane
Pomeroy were assisting Edward Parker
financially and that the reports Emma
Parker spread to the contrary were lies.
He sent Edward a remittance of $300 In
December, 1892, for his trip to Bermuda, a
check for $1000 in January, 1893, then $300
more the following April, and in addition
paid the expenses of his son's sickness.
JACOB RICH`S ESTATE.
Gut Lion Elected Assignee of the Insol
vent Mailtvay President.
SAN JOSE, Cal., June 15.â Gus Lion
was elected assignee of the estate of Jacob
Rich, the insolvent manager of the First
street Railway Company, this morning.
A couple of weeks ago Rich's creditors
petitioned to have him declared insolvent,
and the next day Rich filed a voluntary
petition in insolvency. The hearing of
the creditors' petition came up last Friday
and W. C. Andrews was elected assignee,
with bonds fixed at $2500. This morning
Judge Reynolds decided that the election
of the assignee could not be had under
the creditors' petition but must proceed
under the petition of the insolvent, the
matter having so been decided by the
Federal courts. Thereupon Gus Lion was
elected assignee, he having received the
votes of creditors with claims aggregating
$85,000. while W. C. Andrews was sup
ported by creditors with $45,000 worth of
claims. Lion's bond was placed at $5000.
Rich's liabilities amount to over $300,000,
offset with assets of about the same value.
SAN MATEO'S NEW ROAD
Board of Supervisors Petitioned

REDWOOD CITY, Cat,/, June 15.â A

lege and right to cross said highway from
I one side to the other thereof, and of de
i fleeting therefrom and passing over the
! center line of such bridges as may be
i found upon said road or highway to the

ARE WORKING FOR SILVER
Meeting of the Bimetallic
Unions in Los An
geles.
Pepper Wing of the Movement Failed
to Show Up and Harmony
Prevailed.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 15.â Under
a call issued by G. Washington Baker of
Oakland, Cal., members of the American
Bimetallic Union's Executive Committee
and members of the silverites met here
this evening in mass convention for the
purpose of selecting delegates and alter
nates to the National Silver Party Conven
tion at St. Louis on July 22 next.
Colonel John R. Berry opened the meet
ing by announcing that he bad been au
thorized by Mr. Baker to take charge of
these Senatorial mass conventions for
Southern California. Baker had advised
that as three Senatorial districts cornered
in this city, one "mass convention" would
answer for all.
Colonel Berry was elected chairman of
the meeting. The Pepper wing of the
party failed to show up, and as a result
everything passed off with utmost har
mony.
The Thirty-sixth, Thirty-seventh and
Thirty-eighth Senatorial districts were
represented in the meeting and the follow
ing elections made as delegates and alter
nates to St. Louis: Thirty-sixth District
â C. H. Gosh delegate, E. S. Hubbard alter
nate; Thirty-seventh District â John Love
delegate, K. W. Drorugold alternate; Thir
ty-eighth Districtâ Dr. D. W. Hurst dele
gate, Charles L. Eager alternate.
The representation is to be one delegate
for each of the forty Senatorial districts of
the State and live delegates at large.
Hon. Enoch Pepper was seen to-day and,
In view of the Baker call for Senatorial
conventions, was asked by the correspon
dent what would become of the Congres
sional District conventions called by him
self and Aiva Udell. He answered that he
was awaiting instruction from Chairman
Mott of the National Committee on this
very point. Pepper intimated that there
was a large-sized negro in the woodpile
which boded no good to the Silver party in
California, and that after to-day he would
probably have nothing more to do with it.
Everything would depend on Mott's an
swer to some very pointed questions pro
pounded by himself (Pepper). Mr. Pepper
said tnat Messrs. Chilstrom and LMell had
done great work through Central *nd
Northern California.

WANTED ASHE
TO ADOPT HER
Lillian Ashley's Desire to
Secure a California
Papa.
SECRETARY BARNES' SAY
What a Hidden Stenographer
Overheard in a Detective's
Office.
A SOFT-HEARTED HAWKSHAW.
Testimony That Is Unfit for Publica
tion Adduced in the Baldw'n
Suit. .
MoÃt of the testimony in the Ashley-
Baldwin betrayal suit yesterday was unfit
for publication. Private Secretary Barnes
of Detective J. R. Woods' office was on
the stand nearly all day, and ne went over
much the same details as was brought out
when his employer testified.
Mr. Barnes told of the visit of Miss Ash
ley, her brother and a female friend to the
detective's office in April, 1894. She
called to force Woods to retract a number
of statements embodied in a letter sent to
Miss Ashley while she was stopping at the
Westminster Hotel in Los Angeles in
August, 1893. In that letter Woods
charged the plaintiff in the present suit
with being a blackmailer and a thoroughly
disreputable woman. Among other ar
raignments was one as to a physical dis
ability.
Miss Ashley's reception according to the
testimony of Woods and his assistant
was not what she had hoped. Instead of
securing a disavowal or retraction, the
charges were reiterated with such effect
as to cause the retreat of the brother and
the accompanying female friend. After
their going, a meeting was arranged for the
next day, for the purpose of Woods apolo
gyzing to the other woman for language
used in her presence.
In anticipation of this visit, Barnes was
stationed in an adjoining room to make a
stenographic report of the conversation.
He told on the stand yesterday what he
remembered of that interview. The in
troduction of his testimony was accom
panied with much objection on ;the part
of the plaintiff's attorney, but it was
finally gotten on record that Miss Ashley
nad toid Woods, in the presence of her
female friend, that sbe had been intimate
with Colonel Pope and that she loved him.
She wanted money to go to California on
and intimated that she could just as well
as not make it appear that Pope was the
father of her child.
Woods, on behalf of Colonel Pope, re- j
fused to give her any money, but on the
representation that Miss Ashley was des
titute gave her $50 personally. Woods
told her that she could not fasten the pa
ternity of the child on his client because
of the disparity of dates, but Miss Ashley
replied that she could make the dates
agree if necessary.
Early in the afternoon R. Porter Ashe,
the attorney, was called to testify as to a
letter he received in 1887, signed "Lillian
A. Ashley," which letter asked him to
adopt the writer as his daughter. As he
has lost or destroyed the letter his testi
mony was inadmissible, and he was ex
cused.
The case goes on to-morrow at 11 o'clock,
when the cross-examination of Private
Secretary Barnes will be resumed.

HE MADE ONE FATAL MISTAKE
Placed Under Arrest Because He Imi
tated Uncle Sam's Postage
Stamps.
After nearly a quarter of a century spent
in perfecting a gigantic scheme, intended
to ameliorate the condition of mankind in
general end the absent-minded in partlcu
CRAIGIE GORDON, ORIGINATOR OF THE "WAIF" SYSTEM.
lar, Craigie Gordon of Los Angeles and f
Pasadena finds himself in trouble with the J
United States Government. Gordon was j
arrested at Pasadena last week on a charge j
of im Hating* United States postage-stamp?,
and his plant, stamps aiid circulars were j
seized by Marshal Botello. The local of- i
h'ce was formally notified of the capture, j
but the true facts in the case did not come I
to licht until yesterday.
Gordon's scheme was one of magnificent
possibilities, in that it proposed to recover
for an insignificant sum everything that
mortals are liable to lose except, possibly,
their reputation. The thine was to be
done by a system of ''waif offices," estab
lished throughout the United States, the
postmaster being made the waifmaster.
In a general circular to the public Gordon, |
who signs himseif "United States Waif
niaster General," sets forth the "manner
of procedure to find all kinds of lost prop
erty, including children, persons, etc."
The circular reais as follows:
1. When a person loses anything he writes
on a United States postal card with paid reply
or in a letter, full particulars of his lossâ
when, where, name, address, etc., having a
â¢JO-oent waif stamp printed, penned, pasted or
pinned thereon, bearing the name of the wnif
office and the waifmaster's running number of
the lost waif, and deliver* or mails the same
to the appointed local waifmr.ster.
'1. When a person finds anything he writes
on a United States postal card or in a letter
The 20-Cent Waif Stamp, as Printed by
Craigie Gordon.
particulars as above and delivers or mails the
Nime to the appointed local waifmaster.
S. When the waifmaster finds the lost and
found descriptions to correspond he informs
the loser /on the United States reply postal
card o* in a letter the particulars sent to him
by the finder.
4. All lost and found descriptions not corre
sponding in local postofflces will be sent seven
days after date to Los Angeles waif office for
Southern California, and to San Francisco waifi f
office for Northern California, also to the gen
eral waif office at Washington, D. C, to un
dergo a second and third search, for an ailai
tional 20-cent waif stamp lor each search.
~>. First, second and third-class Postmasters,
on receipt of this circular, will appoint the
waifmnster subject to confirmation, but fourth,
class Postmasters will, unless otherwise ap
pointed, be ordinarily the waifmasters as well.
fp.AKiIE GOItDON,
United States Waifmaster-Ueneral.
Los Angeles, j r ,
t-an Francisco, S '
All that a person has to do under Gor
don's I'topian idea is to report the 1033 of
a $20 piece to the waif office and it will be
returned by the lucky finder in the belief
a;id hope that if he should ever be placed
in a similar position equal favor will be
shown him. All this can be done for the
comparatively small sum of 20 cents. If,
however, the first attempt should fail the
loser is given an opportunity to make a ,
second and even a third effort to recover
his property at the rate of 20 cents an at
tempt. Â .
It was a great scheme financially for
Gordon, even if it was only half a success.
j The waif master-general was to receive 50
per cent of all the coin taken in, the post
master, alias waifmaster, to retain the bal
ance. In the course of time Gordon pro
posed to extend the system throughout
the civilized world. *
Twenty years ago Gordon, with the con
fidence born in the faith of his own idea,
placed his scheme before the Postmaster-
General at Washington. He expected the
Government to errasp the proposition with
the same eagerness with which a drown
ing man catches at a straw. But the de
partment did not see it that way. In fact
I they said a good many unkind things, go
i ing so far as to call him a crank. Gordon
' was much chagrined at his treatment, but
not one whit less determined. Year after
year he returned to the attack, and each
time was given the same answer.
Six months ago Gordon decided to take
the initial step himself. He bought print
ing presses, paper and typo and estab
lished temporary headquarters at Pasa
dena. Waifmasters were appointed in
many of the smaller towns in Southern
California and neighboring States. His
first circular to postmasters reads as fol
lows: US
; CIRCULAR TO WAIFMASTERS
â¢ FROM THE
UNITED STATES WAIF OFFICE.
To N. Sleppy, P. M., China, San Bernardino
County, Catâ Dear Sir: We hereby tender you
the office of waifmaster for your postoffice dis
trict, and in case of your being first, second
or third-class Postmaster prevents your ac
| cepting the office, we ask you to appoint a
suitable person to fill the office, subject al
ways, however, to our approval or dismissal.
In order to commence this new project, in
tended to extend not only throughout our
I'nited States, but to all the nations of the
earth in due time, we inclose you herewith
twelve 20-cent waif stamps for immediate use,
by cancellation, writing thereon the name of
vonr office and running number, commencinjt
with' Nos. 1. 2, 3 and so on.
As the United States Postoflice does not yet
permit the affixing of our waif stamps on
postal cards, you can imitate one by four cross
lines, returning to us the canceled stamp with
your report of business on the first day of
every month.
Before the twelve waif stamps are entirely
used up, send to the address below for a new
supply, together with remittance for the orig
inal twelve at the rate of 10 cents per stamp,
thus leaving you 10 cents for each 20-cent waif
used.
When rewards are offered and not claimed
by the finder, one-half goes to the local waif
master and one-half to the waif-office service.
The same from the sale of articles left in waif
offices when not claimed.
C paigie Gordon, Waifmaster-General.
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Cal. â¢
In getting out his stamps Gordon made
one fatal mistake. On the margin he
placed the words, "U. S. mail." As soon
as the local postal authorities heard of the
scheme they investigated the stamp, and
were not lone in discovering that the
waifmaster-general had laid kimself liable
to the United States laws.
Without further ado they arrested Gor
don, seizing his plant and all the stamps
on hand. The success or failure of the
"waif" system will now probably never be
known, for if Gordon escapes punishment
it will probably be under the promise to
"go and sin no more."
WHITE IS UNDER ARREST
The Cattle King Locked Up
Yesterday for Contempt
of Court.
Would Not Pay His Wife's Counsel
Fees and Went to the
County Jail.
George E. White, the Round Valley
"cattle king, whose domestic and finan
cial difficulties have made him well known
through the medium of the courts, took
up his abode at the County Jail last even
ing, where he will remain until this morn
ing and perhaps longer if the Supreme
Court refuses to intervene in his behalf.
When White's wife began an action for
divorce some time ago sne obtained a par
tial victory in an allowance of $500 for
counsel fees.
White neglected to pay the sum, though
admonished by the court that its man
date must be obeyed, and stated that he
would go to jail first. Then a warrant was
issued for his arrest on a charge of con
tempt of court, but for some reason the
Deputy Sheriffs who were charged with
taking him into custody failed to find him.
Recently he tooK up his residence with a
spiritualist colony, and hearing of his
change of address the Sheriff's deputy lay
in wait for him and finally served the
warrant.
He was taken to the County Jail and his
attorney hurried to the Supreme Court,
where he sued out a writ of haheas corpus
returnable this morning at 10 o'clock.
If the writ is not granted White will
stay in jail until the $500 awarded Mrs.
White by Judge Hebbard is forthcoming.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 16, 1896.
THEY ALL WANT

Members of the Four Hun

Craze.
CORBETT â¢ SHARKEY GO.
Olympic Club Lads Will Attend
the Contest in a
Body.
BETTING ifOW ON THE BESULT.
Pools to Be Sold on the Four-Round
Contest and the Dixon-Flaherty
Fight.
Not until to-night, when pool-selling
will begin, will it be known how the public
regard the two men in the Corbett-Shar
key four-round go.
There has already been some betting, in
cited either by like or dislike, friendship
or something else, but not much. Strong
Sharkey men have not run against enthusi
astic Corbett backers, although one can en
ter almost any public place in the City
and hear adherents of either one or the
other offer to wager large sums of money
on their respective favorites. â¢
But this kind of betting does not count.
It is done through sentiment and not
judgment. Ihe immutable law of supply
and demand will regulate affairs, the odds
being given where the money is the most
plentiful.
The chief points on whicn the betting
must be done and on which the pools will
be sold are: Whether Corbett will "stop"
Sharkey within four rounds; whether
Sharkey will "stop" Corbett within that
time, or which of the two will get a favor
able decision at the close of the contest,
both being on their feet ready to continue
the bout.
Of these propositions the one whether
or not Corbett will "stop" Sharkey is cal
culated to call for the heaviest betting.
The others are generally conceded, that
Sbarkey will neither get a decision in his
favor, nor will he be able to "stop" the
champion, hence odds of "crazy" magni
tude would have to be given to bring about
a wager.
Sharkey's friends are sanguine on the
point that he can neither be knocked out
nor stopped in four rounds. They look
back to his prowess ashipboard, wnen for
amusement he exposed his jaw to the
punches of his mates. They also con
sider the bulldog fashion he went at Joe
Choynski and came out unharmed after
eight hard rounds. They consider him in
the light of one who may not prove a vic
tor, but who cannot possibly be van
quisned.
There is where the sentimental part of
the business comes in, and it is possible
that many thousands of dollars may be
lost in that line by the sailors, of the sev
eral war vessels in these waters.
The old-timers who will look back will
remember poor Clarence Whistler. He
was a wrestler of as fine physique as was
ever seen in this State. Built like SharKey.
only on a little larger mold, he knew how
to handle himself at least as well as does
the sailor. He was the man who, in this
City, invited John L. Sullivan to go into a
back room, lock the door and throw away
the key so as to Save no interference in
fighting it out their own way. Sullivan
did not accept.
Whistler, like Sharkey, was muscle
bound, and could make a terrific battle at
rough-and-tumble, but was hardly able to
stand for a clever fighter.
In those days Jack Brady, a big man,
champion of this State, who was only half

scienced as compared with Corbett, me
Whistler at the old Wigwam.
Whistler, in the estimation of every
body, was to annihilate him.
The fieht lasted less than a minute.
Brady landed on the strong man's jaw and
knocked him out most completely. No
body was more astonished than Brady
himself. He did not believe when he en
tered the ring that he could knock ont his
man in a week's punching, but he believed
he could eventually "stop" him. .
Such is the case with Corbett and
Sharkey. Corbett is satisfied he will
eventually get a favorable decision, but he
does not quite see where he is going to
knock Sharkey out. One good blow will
do this, and there are four rounds in
which one of the cleverest boxers in the
world has time to find the proper place to
land it.
There will be heavy odds offered against
Corbett finishing his man in the first,
second or third rounds.
In connection with the betting on the
contest there are to be pools sold on the
feather-weight contest between Georee
Dixon and Martin Flaherty in Boston to
nieht.
Dixon is champion of the world in his
class, but according to Jim Corbett, who
has seen Flaherty at work, the latter has
at least an even chance, in this twenty
round go, for a decision.
The sale of seats for the coming
event at the Pavilion opened yesterday
morning. The Olympic Club members
took a block of 200 tickets and reserved 100
seats more. The Bohemian Club reserved
fifty seats, and forty more were taken up
by the Pacific-Union Club. These tickets
do not include private purchases, but have
been secured by the respective clubs as in
stitutions.
The Pavilion has been blocked off into
boxes surrounding the platform where the
contest is to take place, and further away
ara tne benches. The galleries are also
fixed with bench seats. In all there will
be seating capacity for 3900 people down
stairs and 3000 upstairs, with prices rang
ing from $2 to $5.
"I expect 10.000 people will be in the
Pavilion on the night of the contest, 1 ' said
Corbett yesterday.
Extra precautions have been taken to
see that all people properly entitled to
witness the mill get their due. Incident
ally precautions are being taken that the
principals get all that is coming to them.
P. D. Linville, the special policeman,
who used to manage the old California
Athletic Club contests, has been placed in
charge of this one. He will have fifty spe
cial policemen under him. Twelve will be
stationed on and will patrol the roof of the
Pavilion, while the others will care for the
inside and outside of the building.
Yesterday Corbett went through his
usual exercise punching the bag and spar
ring with George Green, and he also had
some handball practice.
Neither he nor Sharkey diets very much.
Each eats pretty much what his fancy
calls for, and while Sharkey refrains from
drinking intoxicants Corbett does not
hesitate to take a glass of beer, ale or
champagne.
Bluffing a Biahop.
Bishop Tborburn, the great Methodist
Episcopalian, on the tiunday evening after
the steamer Caledonia left JBombay on her
last voyage, preached on sin. In showing
that sin was simply the generic term for
many evils, he pointed out that charcoal
and diamond were composed of the same
elements differently combined, and said
that if you were to place a chunk of char
coal on the deck and leave it there till the
ship reached Suez it would be found to
have depreciated 25 per cent, whereas a
diamond similarly treated would be found
as pure, as bright and as valuable as when
first deposited in its position. The pro
mulgation of this theory had the effect of
raising an excited controversy on board,
and Mr. Archer, described as a great
Yankee authority on "books," offered the
Bishop to place a piece of charcoal on the
deck on condition that his opponent sup
plied the diamond, and he would bet Rs.
3000 that when the boat reached Suez tliere
would be more charcoal and less diamond
visible. The Bishop shirked the ordeal.â

The Cocopah volcanoes, seventy-five
miles southwest of Yuma, Ariz., have
recently been in violent eruption. The
larger ones emitted great volumes of smoke
and some Humes, and the smaller ones
threw out quantities of water, stones and
mud. The roar of the eruptions could be
heard twenty miles or more.

The Southern Pacific is not going to
j have it all its own way with Eastern
freight. A new rival is in the field and
tlie merchants of San Francisco will have
a chance to patronize it.
When Collis P. Huntinston made his
arrangements with the Panama Railroad
he evidently expected that everything
would be plain sailing and that the oppo
sition was dead. His steamers between
New York and Aspinwall were withdrawn
and sent around the Horn to augment his
I fleet running Detween San Francisco and
I Panama, and the Central American Com
! pany retired from this end of the business.
Soon after the change rates went up and
the only relief importers had was from the
sailing vessels. According to stories told
on the iront yesterday Mr. Huntington
will have another and a determined oppo
sition to fight. Fast steamers have been
chartered, and they will mate the run be
tween New York and San Francisco via
the straits of Magellan. One of the ves
sels is now in this port, and it is said that
Frank S. Johnson of the Johnson- Locke
Company has secured two more in New
York.
The steamer here and one of the vessels
now in the East will load simultaneously,
I and it will be a trial of speed between
I them from port to port. It is expected
that the new line will make almost as
good time as the Panama route, and th
j saving in cost will be very great. All the
i steamers will be good freight-carriers.
and there is enough business in sight to
keep them going for at least twelve
months.
The vessel that has been secured on this
I side of the continent is the Washtenaw.
She is a splendid vessel and very fast.
I She arrived here on the 4th inst. with 4200
j tons of coal from Tacoma for the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company, and made the
I round trip in the remarkably smart time
lof seven days. Since her arrival and dis
; charge she has been lying in Oakland
> Creek awaiting a charter.
Her time came yesterday when one of
| the red-stack company's boats went across
I the bay for her. She was taken to the
I Fulton Iron W 7 orks, where she will be
given a thorough overhauling, after which
she will be ready for the fray. When
everything is in readiness she will prob
ably dock at .Lombard-street wharf and
take aboard a cargo of California merchan
dise.
Mr. Johnson, who is said to nave engi
neered the new deal, is expected home
from New York to-night. Until his return
no one in the company will either affirm
or deny the story. It is known to many
prominent men on th* water front that
sucii a scheme is on foot, and they say
that the Washtenaw will be on her way
before July is very old, and that a steamer
from New York may be expected here early
in September.
The old name of "The North American
Navigation Company" may be used, and
the Johnson-LockeCompany will be the
agents.

IN DEFENSE OF
A FREE PRESS
Revival of the Old Asso
ciation Formed in
1890.
OLD MEMBERS AROUSED.
Judicial Despotism in Contempt
Cases Not to Be Tole
rated.
WILL ENFORCE THE BARRY LAW
An Effort to B-3 Made to Htve a
Plank Inserted in the Democratic
Platform.
Active preparations are being made to
reorganize the Free Press Defense Associa
tion, which the now historic Barry con
tempt case called into existence some six
years ago. A great many of the members
of that organization have been seen dur
ing the past few days and all are anxious
to reorganize the association to take action
in reference to Judge Catlin's decision of
the contempt case of Editor McClatcney of
the Sacramento Bee.
At the time of the first organization of
the defense association public sentiment
was aroused to a remarkable degree In
favor of freedom of speech and of the
press. An immense mass-meeting was
held on September 19, 1890, which was
attended by thousands, who crowded the
streets in their efforts to gain admittance
to the hall. Many of the most prominent
men of the City were present. Among
the vice-presidents were: Judge James G.
Magnire, Richard I. Whelan, John J. Me-
Darte, M. M y McGlynn, president of the
Federated Trades; W. J. B. Mackay, edi
tor of the Coast Seamen's Journal; Patrick
Eeddy and others. Stewart Menzies pre
sided over the meeting. With the greatest
entnusiasia ihe following resolutions were
passed :
Whebkas, On the 30th day of September,
1 -->:'. .fames I\. Barry was brought beiore the
Superior Court of the City and County of San
Francisco, State of California, for an alleged
contempt for publishing a criticism of Judge
F. EL Lawler; and said. Barry thereupon de
manded his constitutional right of a trial by
jury, and offered to prove his charges as pub
lished by him, and the Judges presiding re
i tsed such a trial, and announced that Un
truth was not a defense, and thereupon ordered
said Barry to he imprisoned and fined; and
whereas, on the 11th day of September, 1890,
-iLpreme Court confirmed such doctrine
niter keeping the case over eight months by a
decision without citing a single authority:
;i .\v be it
Resolved, By the citizens of San Francisco in
â¢meeting assembled in defense of liberty:
That the doctrine asserted in this case is in de
fiance of the laws and constitution of Cali
fornia and oi the United States and a direct
:sion of the constitution and a deadly as
sault upon the guaranteed liberties of the
â  â¢ of the United States and without a legal
or moral foundation, and on a par with the
despotism Â»>f Russia, where men are in like
manner hurried to prison without trial, and
renders the whole people subject to imprison
ment at any hour withoul trial or opportunity
to prove the truth, for criticism of a Judge,
and
Krsolred. That the act of Congress of March
31, 1831, passed for the purpose of preventing
the Judges of the United States from ever de
ny inp a jury trial formatters spoken or wTit
ten of a Judge out of court, and which lor
sixty years has been found sufficient to protect
all the United States courts and which is so
plain as to leave no room for Judges to destroy
liberty under the color of construing law,
should be immediately substituted in place of
section 1209 of the Code of Civil Procedure of
California, and we demand such action by the
next Legislature.
The following Legislature obeyed the
demand of the people thus expressed and
pas-sped tbe following law, which has since
become famous as the Barry contempt
law:
No speech, statement or publication reflect
ing upon or concerning any court, or any of
ficer thereof, shall be treated or punished as a
contempt of such court unless made in the im
mediate presence of such court while in ses
sion, and in such a manner &s to actually in
terfere with its proceedings.
Having accomplished this the old Free
Press Defense Association went out of ex
istence. The recent effort to declare the
Barry law unconstitutional and to assert
an inherent right of a Judge to punish for
contempt has aroused the spirit of the
members of the old association and they
will again take up the fight. Toward the
end of this week a meeting will probably
be held and an effort will be made to have
Congressman Maguire for president of the
association.
An effort will also be made to have a
plank inserted in the Democratic plat
form voicing the sentiment expressed by
the people of this City six years ajzo. In
1890 there were strong planks calling for
the enactment of the contempt law in
both Republican and Democratic plat
forms, and in compliance with the de
mands made in theÂ«e plank? the Barry
law was passed. Whether or not the de
sired plank shall be inserted in this year's
Democratic platform the association will
be reorganized just the same, and the old
fight against irresponsible judicial power
will be prosecuted with old-time vieor.
NEW BARBERS' UNION.
An Organixnhon for the. Elevation ol
the Tia'e Will Be Formed
To-Night.
The International Journeymen Barbers'
Union wili be temporarily organized this
evening.
For some time past there has been much
dissatisfaction witli the present organiza
tions and several active mem rare started
out to organize a new body. These or
ganizers fire: F. Hodges, J. Heegler, I.
IS. Bergholtz, J. L. Isaacs, C. H.
'-pwicer and F. Barrett.
L n<Jer the present order in the unions
i'ne members not oniy have to pay their
dues, but pay forever)' situation they se
cure from the employment secretary, and
â  otn plaints have been made that those
who paid the most cot the best places.
Th" new union will at once -ipÂ«et the old
order of thinÂ«s and the organisers expect
\u absorb two of the present associations.
After forming a temporary organization
a request will be made lor a charter from
the International Union. The new body
wil lie :i beneliciary organization as well
as a trades union. The dues will be 50
cents a month. An allowance of $5 a
wc.k will be made for sick members and
$50 for funeral excuses in case of death.
In addition an employment secretary will
be kept under salary and work wili be se
cured for unemployed barbers upon the
payment of a registration fee ot 25 cents.
There will be no preference shown; the
first applicant will be the first served, if ne
be competent.
No one will be admitted to membership
unless he has served an apprenticeship
of three years, and no college barber
''graduates'' will be admitted to the union
under any circumstances, nor are master
barbers eligible to membership. The lat
ter, however, are favorable to the new
union.
The objects are to elevate the craft, pro
tect its members, lessen the hours of labor
and secure the closing of shopn on week
days, Saturdays excepted, at 8 p. m., and
on Sundays at noon. So far 113 journey
men barbers have signed the charter roll.
SALVATION WORK
The Volunteers of America Endeavor
to Organize on 1 his Coast.
Staff Captain Gardner, the officer in
charge of the Volunteers of America on
the Pacific Coast, was in the City yester
day on business. He finds the nucleus for
a tine post already, and many are signify
ing their intention of joining the move
ment as soon as the work is opened.
The staff captain is well pleased with
the outlook throughout the State, but is
hampered somewnat by lack of officers.
He refutes the statement that the Volun
teers are seeking to recruit tneir ranks
from the English organization. "But any
officers," says Mr. Gardner, "who sever
their connections honorably with the old
movement and seek admittance to the
new w.ll not be turned away, but will be
given a place immediately, as our need is
very great."
A post was successfully opened in Stock
ton on Thursday last and the prospects
are said to be very encouraging. Many
other posts may be established on the
coast as soon as officers are secured.
SCHOOL DAYS ARE OVER
Interesting Closing Exercises of
the Classes of St. Pat

Those Who Received Meda's and Pre
miumsâThe Graduating Exercises
of St. Vincent's Academy.
The closing exercises of the St. Patrick's

noon, was an event pleasant alike to the
parents and friends of the pupils, to the
pupils themselves and to the Sisters of
Charity, who are their teachers.
The hall, which was tastefully decorated

River"; a concert recitation, "Liberty
Bell," by the elocution class, after which
the third grade told what they knew about
choosing professions.
Eight little boys debated "Should
Women Vote?" and the verdict was that
they should" not. Seventy large boys of
the lower grades gave a very amus
ing lecitation, and Frederick " Gorman
gave a recitation, a humorous account of
the troubles of Mr. Brown who had his
hair cut. "Put Your Shoulder to the
Wheel," sunÂ« by the fourth grade, was
followed by a rendering by Joseph Far

ON LOVE AND DOOM
Pastors Listen to Papers on Widely
Differing Subjects.
Rev. J. B. Knight read a blank-verse
poem before the Baptist Ministers' Confer
ence yesterday, entitfed "An Infidel's Re
flections on the Opening Scenes of the
Judgment Day." The poem depicted a
dialogue between an infidel and a Chris
tian, and finally showed how despair
seized the infidel when he found that the
judgment had really come.
Rev. M. P. Boynton thought the poem
depicted the last day in too dark colors,
but he admired the literary merits of the
poem. Several of the other pastors in dis
cussinc the poem said it was the most re
markable piece of literary work that had
ever been read before the Baptist Preach
ers' conference.
Christian Pastors.
The Christian pastors met yesterday
afternoon in the Y. M. C. A. building, and
appointed Professor Elston of Berkeley
temporary chairman. Officers will be
elected on the last Monday in the month.
Rev. Edwards Davis of Oakland ad
dressed tne meeting on the divine com
mand to love one another. He pointed
out that "Love ye one another" is an ideal
command, difficult of fulfillment as long
as man is mortal, and he gave as bis opin
ion that the way to make the command
easy of fulfillment is for men and women
to strive to become lovable.
In the discussion Rev. H. V. Morgan of
Alanieda said: "I believe when man
reaches the truest state there will be much
of the feminine nature of true lovableness
about him." Dr. Gardener said true
Christian love takes the form of help and
assistance: "If we are actuated by this
principle of love we shall go down into
the slums of the City and help the people
there."
Presbyterian Pastors.
Rev. J. Cummin'g Smith read a paper
before the Presbyterian Ministerial Union
yesterday on Dr. George A. Gordon's book,
''The Christian of To-day." He took ex
ception to a few of the Boston divine's
views, but spoke of him as a tine idealist.
Congregational Clnti.
The Congregational Missionary Club de
voted its time yesterday to listening to
and discussing a paper by Rev. G. T. Mc-
Collum of San Lorenzo on "Some Homo
letic Values of the Visions of Zachariah."
The speaker said all the books of the Bible
were written for some specific purpose in
some special stage of history and to be
understood should be studied in that light.
REVERSED THE DECISION
The Supreme Court Renews the
Injunction in the Paahua
Case.
Nevada Bank Will Not Vote Rudolph
Spreckels' Stock at the Next
Election.
Tbe Supreme Court yesterHay overruled
the action of the Superior Court in the
case oi Rudolph Spreckels against the Ne
vada Bank. The decision does not materi
ally affect the merit* of the i ise, however,
merely preventing the voting of a block of
stock at the coming election of ollicers of
the I'aahua Plantation Company of Ha
waii. The history of the case as submit
ted to the Supreme Court is that the
trouble started with the purchase of $700,
-000 worth of Hawaiian bonds by C. A.
Spreckels from Claus Sprecicels, C. A.
Spreckels pledging collateral securities to
secure payment. Rudolph Spreckels
pledged 5000 shares ot Paahuu Plantation
Company bonds, valued at $1000 per share,
under an agreement with Claus Spreckels
tiiat the stock shouid not be transferred
out of the owner's name on the books of
the company until after the maturity of
the debt.
Claus Spreckels transferred the securi
ties to the Nevada fiank when one-half of
the debt was paid and one-half of the se
curities return cd. it is claimed that the
securities retained are of greater value
than the amount oi the remaining debt.
The bank threatened to return the secur
ities to Hawaii to be transferred from the
owner's name, that the stock nii^ht be
voted at the next election of I'aahua
Company officers, when Rudolph Spreck
els enjoined them from so aoiiiEr. The
Superior Court dissolved the injunction
and the case was appealed to the buprema
Court, which has reversed that decision,
so the injunction is again in force.
FOR THE FOURTH.
The Japanese and School Children to
J'art icipate in the Parade.
The several sub-committees of the
Fourth of July executive committee are
laboring zealously to insure a creditable
celebration of our National independence.
This evening the merchants and busi
ness men will meet the decoration com
mittee :n: n the assembly-room of the Mills
building to consider the feasibility of the
adoption of the plan for a grand electrical
illumination of the public streets.
A novei feature of the parade this year
will be the appearance in line of the iap
anese {Patriotic Club. The members will
wear their national uniform and be armed
with muskets. Two floats will be dis
played by the Ladies of the Grand Army of
the Republic, Gettysburg Circle.
An erroneous impression got abroad
that no floats reminiscent of the late Civil
War would be permitted in the parade.
This idea is entirely without foundation
and the various posts of the Grand Army
of the Republic will be so advised by
Secretary Smith.
At ye.-terday's session of the decoration
committee the secretary was directed to
notify the decorators to be present at the
meeting of the busin- sa men to beheld to
night in the assembly- room and to be pre
pared to submit their respective plans and
estimates of cost. An appropriation of
$2500 will be asked from the executive
committee.
Grand Marshal Umbsen yesterday con
sulted with a number of the teachers con
cerning the display of floats to be made
by the public schools. Historical inci
dents dating from the lauding of Co
lumbus will be designed and submitted by
all schools desiring to compete for the
prizes offered by the committee.
PRESBYTERY MEETS.
Both the French and the Italian Work
Will Be Continued.
At the meeting of tne San Francisco
Presbytery yesteiday afternoon Judj,'e
Thornton offered the formal call to Rev.
S.J.Kennedy to St. John's Presbyterian
Church At the suggestion of Rev. J. C.
Smith the call was accepted. It was
signed by J. S. Thornton, E. W. Newhall
and Rev. F. R. Farrand, moderator of
presbytery. The pastor's salary will be
$1500 per annum, but the young people
will add several hundred dollars a year
more in the shape of rent.
The French and Italian work of the
presbytery was discussed, and it was re
solved to continue both, John Russell
being superintendent of the Italian work
and Rev. Eugene Duprey of the French
work. It was announced that the new
Howard Presbyterian Churcn will be
dedicated on the 2d of August.

ABE IN FAVOR OF
THE DOLLAR LIMIT
Report of the Finance Com
mittee of the Super
visors.
WANT A LOW TAX LEVY
Condition of Trade and the
Wishes of the Public Given
as a Reason.
CITY FATHERS ARE ON RECORD
The Health and Police Committee
i Strongly Condemns the City
Prison Sanitation.
The Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors put itself on record yesterday
at the meeting of the board in favor of a
lower tax levy than that of the year 1895-6,
and while not saying it in so many words
intimated that the public was much better
satisfied under the old dollar limit and
that while the levy mignt not be confined
to the dollar op the hundred it should be
kept close to that figure.
The committee asks oniy that the pub
lic organizations, large and small, lend
them moral support and pledces a levy
that will be satisfactory to the public.
The report of the committee is as follows:
In the matter of the tax levy for the fiscal
year 1896-7 It appears from the present condi
tions ttiat the taxpayers deprecate and dread
the Imposition of an onerous tax rate, believ
ing that it an excessive rate was imposed it
would he a grievous burden and disastrous in
its effects at this juncture, when business and
business prospects are far from alluring.
The decadence in value caused by a decrease
in rentals and the many unoccupied buildings
and portions of buildings in various portions
of our City demand as light burdens in a tax
rate as can be imposed. In addition to the
tax rate street improvements are to be met by
property-owners and all the expenditures
which have to be provided for necessary to the
maintenance of business and the repair and
improvement of premises to keep pÂ«ce with
growing wants in the endeavor to realize some
return on investments.
Your committee cannot shui its eyes to the
signs of the times and the present needs of our
citizens, the most important of which is the
tax rate, and for relief from an excessive rate
they look to the members of this board.
In the imposition of a levy of 1.56% in addi
tion to the State levy of (i^'i cents on each
$100, making a total of $2 "-J5 for the fiscal
year of 1805-96, our citizens were appalled
aid have not yet recovered, but now simply
dread any such tax rate being imposed under
present conditions.
While it is true that the last Legislature
aided greatly to maintain the levy, yet the
Supreme Court in its decisions has substan
tially decided that it is the duty of the Hoard
oi >iir>ervisors to levy a sullic'ient amount to
provide for and pay all liabilities that may
occur and which in'ihe exercise of a wise dis
cretion is simply a matter of impossibility to
provide '.or, yet in order to avoid and hold "the
city harmless from paving pa.>t claims, such is
the dictum ot the court and therefore the law,
because it is the construction placed on the
constitutional provision which inhibits ex
penditures in excess of the revenue.
The dollar-limit pledge of conventions was a
boon to the taxpayers and was such a pledge
as protected all the material interest*: and
Checked to some extent extravagant expendi
tures. All went well and for years this pledge
was recognized and steadily "adhered to, but
by the extravagant expenditures of depart
ments having independent powers and sutisc
(juent decisions of the Supreme Court larger
amounts than were appropriated were paid
out of the treasury and legimate demands
were practically declared illegal, thus causing
an indebtedness which the court decides can
never be paid out of the treasury. In addition
the court decides it to be your duty to provide
sufficient funds to meet all liabilities. The
custom heretofore pursued in making
the levy was for your honorable
board to make reasonable estimates
of what proper expenditures should
be made for the various municipal purposes,
and in making such estimates the dollar-limit
pledge was kept in view, so that the total levy
would not exceed that pledge.
At the close of the fiscal year certain in
debtedness in excess of revenue often oc
curred, but it was never contemplated that
this indebtedness should be repudiated, but
by common consent was paid and the govern
ment went without violating its tax pledge.
It now appears from the position heretofore
assumed by officers of the City and the conse
quent decisions of the Supreme Court that un
un sufficient revenue is provided in any one
year no expenditure of that year in excess of
the revenue can be paid and that the tax levy
must not be increased beyond any reasonable
requirements to meet expenditures that could
not be estimated, or provided for.
Your committee feels that your honorable
board is placed in a false position; in other
words, after using Jour best judgment in
estimating and providing for reasonable ex
penditures the onus and liability is imposed
on the board if for any cause the revenue pro
vided is uot sufficient to meet the expendi
tures, and while such a conclusion is unjust,
yet the Supreme Court holdÃ this to be the
law, and this board, unless indemnified
against liability, must, against the best judg
ment of the members, impose a tax rate
which as individuals they cannot indorse.
Your Finance Committee feels and so ex
presses its views, believing that all the mem
bers of your honorable board will indorse such
action as will insure a low and yet sufficient
tax rate for the ordinary expenses of the gov
ernment; that if representative bodies of our
fellow-citizens will indorse such a proposition
and will pledge their support in case of ex
penditures by ind'pendent departments in
excess of appropriations, that said bodies will
aid in absolving this board from any liability
in case of such expenditures creating a de
ficiency, that there will be no question that
your board will cheerfully respond In making
appropriations that will impose only such a
levy as will be indorsed by our citizens.
Your committee, in order that the feeling of
trepidation and unrest in the minds of our
citizens may De allayed, will on receiving tne
Auditor's estimates this month proceed at
once to revise and make estimates that the
amount of the tax levy may be determined,
and such rate be levied on the third Monday
in September next as is required by law, so
that the different departments may be advised
of the appropriation to be made for the fiscal
year, and govern themselves accordingly. ,
In individual interviews the Supervisors,
with the exception of the Snpervisor from
the Third, expressed themselves as thor
oughly in favor of a lower rate, and agreed
that the Dig appropriations asked by "some
of the departments must be pruned down.
The Health and Police Committee re
ported to the board that it bad made an in
spection of the City Prison and had found
it in a very bad sairnary condition. It
was spoken of as remarkblethat in a build
ing that had cost the taxpayers so much
money such a state of affairs could exUt.
Numerous improvements were advised.
The ordinance placing the power of giv
ing permits for boxing contests in the
hands of the board instead of those of the
Mayor was finally passed.
The matter of selecting an architect for
the new municipal building was put over
for one week, as was the matter of select
ing a site for the Pesthouse.

CAMERON AND THUR MAN.
The Former Told How He Would Save
the General.
Representative Brosius of Pennsylvania
has a good deal of veneration for the great
men who have shed luster on his State,
and he treasures the incidents and anec
dotes which illustrate their character.
Here is one which he tells on Simon Cam
eron.
General Cameron and his friend. Judge
Thurman, were enjoying together the twi
light hour, both in a contemplative mood.
After a period of silence Thurman said:
"General, don't you think both of us had
better be thintirg of St. Peter? You are
older than I, and I know you will die
first. Then you will go up to the gates of
heaven and be forcea to wander around
awhile till I come as your attorney. I
will, simply say to St. Pe"ter that you were
a fast friend, a stanch patriot, and gave
the best of your youth to the Democratic
party; that you became 'fishy,' that is.
Republican in faith, when possibly it
would have been well for a good many
more Democrats to have turned with you
But I will tell St. Peter that, though 'you
are a Republican now, you are a stanch
American and he had better let you in
for, if he don't you will raise Ned outside.'
Then, as an honest advocate, I will tell the
court that when you get in you will insist
upon having the appointment of all the of
ficers of Bt. Michael's army, and every one
there will be a Pennsylvan'ian or the son
of a Pennsylvanian.
This, of course, referred to Cameron's
well-known devotion to his friends and
his success in securing appointments for
them. At the close of this conversation
after another silence, Thurman said:
"Well, general, when we have both passed
the gat- s and are snugly settled in one
particular mansion, what will we sing?"
The General replied, as quick as a flash,
"Old Folks at Home.' --Washington Btar.
Under the German law adulterators are
punished with more severity than pick
pockets.

IRCGUOIS' GRAND WHOOP UP.
Lcs Angeles Delegation Will Spring
the San Pedro and Santa Monica
Fight on the Convention.
Iroquois braves, Buckley lambs and the
followeis of the Daggett-McNab Junta
were massed at the ferry station at the
foot of Market street a few minutes before
4 o'clock yesterday afternoon. These
Democratic politicians were bound for
Sacramento to attend the State Conven
tion of the party. Mixed in the throng
were delegates from Mendoeino, Santa
Clara, Santa Barbara, San Mateo and San
Luis Obispo counties.
Iroquois excursion tickets were in great
furor, but the supply wa3 fully equal to
the demand.
Braves had packages of tickets to dis
pose of at $3 35 for the round trip. Word
was given out that the Iroquois would
have a special car. Tickets enough were
sold to justify the make-up ot a special
train. Many of the party workers who
went to the ferry as spectators raised the
necessary coin to buy a ticket and went
away with their fellows rejoicing.
The sight of the "push" and "pull" of
the party in San Francisco interested the
delegates from the country. The latter
stood in groups apart from the line and
studied their brother Democrats, seeking
to detect by exterior signs the difference
between the Lambs and the Junta
In the send-off harmony prevailed. The
Iroquois crowd represented delegates from
i ten faction of the party, and all promised
!o make things hum in Sacramento.
Among the passengers leaving for Sacra
mento at 4 o'clock were A. S. Cooper and
N. C. Derm of Santa Barbara, Senator
Seawell, Alex. Duncan, John Ruddick,
Samuel Rice and Jack \VeJdon of Mendo
Â»ino; C. Ivins, San Luis Obispo; Senator
Bizgy, Charles Gelden, Jack Man nix, John
Foiey, Dr. Bryan, Senator Fay, James
Nealon, M. J. Donovan, P. M. Wellin,
.'ere Lynch, Con SulJivan and Clitus Bar
hour. Thomas Chandler went along with
John Foley and Jack Mannix to attend to
brewery business in Sacramento.
Jere Lynch, president of the Hale<fc Nor
cross mine, arrived at the depot just in
time to get aboard the boat. He is a dele
gate and will denounce Buckley as he
points to the pyramids of Egypt.
Mr. Rankin of Santa Clara, whose dele
gation is in line /or the free coinage of sil
ver, barely caught the boat. Supplies se
cured in San Jose and deemed absolutely
necessary for a Democratic convention in
Sacramento did not arrive at the ap
pointed time. Just before the doors closed
the goods came, and the Santa Clara dele
gates were happy.
When the delegates of the rival factions
left the City for Sacramento the regular
Democrats, or Buckley men, were as eon-
Mentasever that some one other than
Frank Gould would be brought out for
enairman of the convention. They laid
izreat stress on the fact that the orators of
the regular Democracy â the speakers foT
a delegation pledged to the free coinage of
silver â would be on the floor of the con
vention by proxy of rural delegates, and
thus privileged to speak their sentiments
would make such eloquent appeals that
the convention would do justice to the
ileleeation. It is a sure thing that Orators
Clunie, Rothschild, Nealon, Donovan,
O'Brien and Piatt will meet in the arena
j-uch gifted statesmen as J. V. Coleman,
Jere Lynch, Gavin McNab, John Foley
and Jack Mannix.
Among the Lamb? the greatest indigna
tion was caused by the report that McNab
had issued badges to the Junta delegates
which would admit each holder of a
badge to the privilege of the voting floor.
It is true that the Buckley men have their
credentials as regular Democrats, but
documents of this kind, ever so potent at
the Occidental Club, are sure to be dis
counted by the convention gate-keepers
unless supplemented by a badge.
The Junta delegates were laughing yes
terday at the chagrin of the regulars. The
idea "that the Buckley delegates would be
allowed to participate in the proceedings
of the convention was regarded as ab
surd. As for silver they asserted that ail
the delegates were for free silver. "W T hy,
they have given up the fight," said one of
the Junta. "They are talliing about
Gould's defeat for chairman when there is
no opposing candidate."
Delegates from other counties of the
State are not inclined to take an active
part in the San Francisco quarrel. A. S.
Cooper of Santa Barbara expressed the
opinion that the delegates from his sec
tion of the State did not particularly fancy
Buckley since the boss decamped from
California some years ago.
The Los Angeles delegation is claimed
as supporters of the regulars in San Fran
cisco, as against the Junta. Word comes
from the south that this delegation in
tends to bring the Santa Monica and San
Pedro harbor improvement fight in the
State Convention. The Santa Barbara
and San Luis Obispo delegations fancy
that the fight is purely a local subject,
which should not be introduced in the
convention.
An anti-A. P. A. plank is sure to receive
the strongest indorsement of tne conven
tion, at least so says Mr. Cooper ot Santa
Barbara. He is also against woman suf
frage. "There is only one man for gold in
our delegation, and as I hold his proxy,
we will be solid for silver."
Mr. Rankin of Santa Clara wore as a
campaign button a bright twenty-cent sil
ver coin. The style seemed to catch the
popular fancy.
M'NEIL TO BE HELD
Judge Campbell Will IJecido To- Day
What the Charge Will
Be.
Frank McNeil, painter, charged with
assault to murder, had another inning
before Judge Campbell yesterday.
Mrs. O'Grady, in whose saloon on Mary
and JJatoma streets the assault took
place, and Minnie O'Grady, her daughter,
testified that Frank Rankin, the young
man assaulted, did not have a hatchet, as
testified to by McNeil, while Isabella
O'Grady, a younger daughter, testified
that she saw McNeil strike Rankin the
last blow with a hatchet.
The Judge said he did not believe the
true facts had been brought out, but that
a lot was being kept back. He saw be
tween the lines that love was the motive I
for the attack. They were quarreling
over Minnie O'Grady and Rankin got the
worst oi it.
"I don't think there is much use hold
ing McNeil," continued the Judge, "but
all the same I am going to do it." I had
him up once before for beating and an
noying a respectable woman and the jury
acquitted him. T threw the jury out of
the courtroom and told them I never
wanted to see them again. This man
McNeil is a hard character and I am not
going to take the responsibility of letting
him go. I fix his bail at $5000 and will de
termine the charge to-morrow. 1 '

IN MEMORY OF DR. F. V. HOPKINS
Sketch of the Genius and Kindness of
the Physician.
Dr. Frederick V. Hopkins, the well
known physician, died in this City on the
26th of last month, after a brief illness.
He was a son of the late Bishop Hopkins
of the Protestant Episcopal church in the
diocese of Vermont, and he was the
brother of the late Rev. John Henry Hop
kins, D.D., the well-known writer on
theological subjects.
Dr. Hopkins was the youngest member
in Bishop Hopkins' family of thirteen
chiTdren, and in common with them he
inherited the characteristic lifts and tal
ents of that remarkable family. Engag
ing in the study of medicine in early life,
ne devoted his later days to scientific re
search in the lines of his chosen peofes
sion, and especially in microscopical in
vestigations.
"While his skill as a practitioner was
recognized by the medical faculty gener
ally, it is as a specialist in bacteriology
and the application of the microscope in
pathological investigations that he wi.l
Hereafter be best known; and, indeed, sev
eral of his investigations have already
received the recognition of originality
from other scientists. To a les9 diffident
and retiring man some of his discoveries
would have brought in his lifetime a more
substantial return than the tardy honors
that are too often bestowed on genius in
obituary or epitaph.
About eigiit years ago he passed throngh
a serious illness, which came at the age
w.ien financial reverses and the loss of
strengtli together render the uncertain
game of life a continuous struggle. He
seemed after it no longer able to nold his
own against unfavorable circumstances,
ur to undertake some forms of work that
might offer the opportunity of regaining
the former conditions of affairs when the
days were prosperous and things went
smoothly with him and those depending
on him.
Hut neither ill fortune nor the lack of
physical energy at any time interfered
with his charity toward suffering human
ity and the love for his work. In days of
discouragement, as in the time of success,
he gave his services with cheerfulness,
and the deserving sick and needy did not
ask help of him in vain.
Many will remember his attentions and
kindness in the slck room, and none more
than those whose circumstances offered no
return for time and labors given but pray
ers and tearful thanks.
The erateml remembrance of these are
his best obituary; the love for fallen man
exhibited in such deeds, bis best epitaph.
I >r. Hopkins leaves a widow and five chil
dren ; two children grown, a boy of 15 and
one of eight, and a little girl of 13 years.
HIS LITTLE ALLOWANCE.
Randolph Simpson Will Have to
Worry Along on $70
a Month.
Judge Seawell Says That Men Wbo
Cannot Support a Family Should
Wot Marry.
Judee Seawell yesterday decided that if
Randolph Simpson and wife could not get
along on $70 a month, Randolph would
have to get a move on and earn more than
$45 during that period of time. As the
matter now stands, the young man is in
receipt of $35 a month from his mother
and $45 every thirty days as a reward for
labor performed.
At the death of Dr. James Simpson, an
estate was left in trust in the hands of
James AY. Kerr, for Mrs. Ada Sinii>M-!i,
she, out of the proceeds, to support her
son, Randolph Simpson, and to educate
! him. The latter provision has been
j carried out anii in obedience to tne former
! $35 a month was allowed the young man.
! As Randolph's tastes are expensive he has
! found this amount far too email to meet
his requirements. To make matters worse,
â  i-Candolpn, a short time ago, took unto
himself a wife; this too, without the
I knowledge or consent of his mother.
Even with the added responsibility on
i his shoulders the son was refused a raise
j in his allowance by his remaining parent,
I so he brought suit to compel an increase!
Judge Seawell, however, declined to aid
the young benedick. He took into consid
! eration the terms of the trust, which pro-
I vide for an increase in allowance only in
: case of necessity or sickness, and also the
| fact that the wedding was unauthorized
Iby Mrs. Simpson. Then Randolph's dis
| position toward profligacy was a point
i against him, so his Honor said :
I d" While I believe in encouraging young
I people to enter the married state, yet I do
! not think they should do so unless they
| hart the means of earning a respectable
living for their families, so I will sustain
the action of the trustee in the case."
RAILWAY CIRCLES.
The Southern Pacific Southern Exten
sionâProgress on the Valley Road.
Third V ice-President Stubbs of the
Southern Pacific Railway Company de
parted for Los Angeles in iiis private car
yesterday afternoon. Nothing definite
could be learned concerning the object of
his trip at this time, but it is understood
his visit to the south has to do with the
branch extension in that direction. It
may also be pretty accurately inferred that
arrangements are approaching completion
for transferring the bulk of the freight
shipment northward from the east to the
west side of the bay. When the change is
made the company's ferry saving will ag
gregate thousands of dollars weekly.
The daneerously erratic elevator cage in
the Southern Pacific building at the
corner of Market and Montgomery streets,
which came so near being converted into
a deathtrap Saturday, was undergoing re
pairs yesterday. It was noticed that
many of the company's employes and
nearly all outsiders who had business in
the upper-floor offices preferred the heat
and fatigue of the twisting stairways to
the easier but more doubtful means of
ascension. The elevator machinery is to
be thoroughly overhauled and carefully
tested.
The Valley road won another important
right-of-way suit in Merced County last
week and two more of equal importance
are to come up this week. In the latter
cases between three and four suits of
right of way are involved, but an easy
victory or mutually satisfactory com
promise is anticipated. Construction con
tinues to progress at the rate of about a
mile and a half a day. Encouraging re
ports are received from the right-of-way
agents below Fresno.

THE SAX FKA^CiSCU CALL, TUESDAY, JUJNE 1(5, 1896.
PREDICT SUCCESS
FOR DR. NANSEN.
Report of the Geographical
Society's Commit
tee.
POLAR REGION CURRENT
Examination Into the Genuine
ness of the "Jeannette"
Relics.
VARIOUS EVIDENCE PRESENTED
The "Fram's" Expedition Declared to
Be Warranted and Its Return
Probable.
The printed report of the committee ap
pointed by the Council of tne Geographi
cal Society of the Pacific to investigate
the genuineness of the relics of the ill
fated Jeannette, which sailed from San
Francisco on July 8, 1879, and foundered
in the Arctic Ocean in June of the follow
ing year, has been issued.
In the reDort of the committee, which
consisted of George Davidson and Henry
Lund, many interesting data are given con
cerning Arctic currents.
The investigations just completed were
due to the interest manifested in this City
in regard to the relics, inasmuch as Dr.
Nansen's theory of polar currents was
based principally upon the rinding of the
Jeannette relics in 1884. The further fact
that some of the relics belonged to San
Francisco gives them additional local in
terest.
Doubt has been cast upon the relics
being genuine by Dr. W. H. Dall of the
United States Geological Survey and Dr.
Emil Bessels. The latter declared that he
had evidence "tending to support his
hypothesis that some person or persons
unknown had 'in a spirit of boyish levity'
perpetrated the hoax of placing the
relics on an ice-floe and thereby'produc
ing a sensation in the fleet.' "
Dr. Dall in his conclusions as to the
relics stated that "the proof that the relics
were the result of a hoax is not complete,
and, in the nature of things, unless the j
parties actually concerned shall admit it, j
is never likely to be completed/ 1
General Greely also doubted the genu
ineness of the relics. In the National
Geographic Magazine of March, 1896, he
wrote that "the drift relics found on tne !
west coast of Greenland were relied upon
by Nansen's practical proof that his theory
of a drift voyage was correct." Greely
iurther declares that "Chief Engineer Mel
ville, the man best qualified to speak about
the JÂ«annette, denied at the time their !
genuineness."
General Greely further says that he i
"publicly called Nansen's attention to j
this question, which for the first time |
seems to have created doubts in his mind.
Nansen made efforts to find the relics for
verification, but they had disappeared in
toto."
After mentioning various Arctic drifts, j
the report takes up the evidence concern- ;
ing the Jeannette relics. While the Jean- 1
nette was fixed in the ice in the vicinity of ;
W range 11 Land, stores, clothing instru- j
ments, etc., were placed on an adjoining >
floe. Very little of this was taken along j
when the retreat over the ice was com
menced. Mrs. Emma de Long (vol. 11, I
page 578) says there were 170 pieces left on
the floe after the live or six days spent in
I preparation of the sleds, boats and stores, j
The retreat was commenced over the ice i
June 18, 1881.
In June, 1884, Governor Carl Lytzen ot i
i the Colony of Julianehaab, South Green- J
iarul, wrote to the Danish Consul at New j
York: "I hereby take tne liberty to re- I
cjUPst the Consulate to inform the editors !
ot the New York Herald that on the 18th i
inst. three Greenlanders picked upon an !
ice floe some effects and some partly torn j
papers belonging the American Arctic i
'Jeannette' expedition."
Upon receipt of this information in this j
City various investigations were made, I
the latest being those just completed by â¢:
Messrs. Davidson and Lund. All avail- i
able evidence was considered, although j
the relics themselves had disappeared. â 
Mr. Lund, in a recent letter, said in re- |
gard to the lost relics: "In June, 1894, I i
met Commodore Otto Irminger of the j
Geographical Society of Copenhagen and I
in our conference he informed me that j
much to the regrdt of the society and all |
parties concerned it was impossible to I
find any of the relics. They had been !
given into the charge of a member whom
they considered a perfectly safe custodian, ]
who had placed them in the garret of his j
dwelling. This person died and when
some time afterward other people moved
into the house they had it cleaned up j
and the rubbish removed by scavengers â 
to the dump hills.
"Among this rubbish were the relics, so
unsuggestive that any one unacquainted !
with iheir history would naturally con- I
sider them of no" value. The Society of j
Copenhagen only missed them some time i
after when our society was seeking to pur- j
chase some of them. It was then too late I
to recover them and Commodore Irminger j
said nothing remained but to express pro
found regret."
The report of the committee concludes i
as follows:
"After carefully weighing these state- \
ments and recalling the mental and pnysi- '
cal cnaracteristics of Dr. Xansen and "the j
brave comrades and men who cheerfully j
accompany him, and tt>e special fitness of I
the Fram to encounter ice dangers, the
committee places upon record its convic
tions â that the present expedition was
fully warranted and that it will return suc
cessful.'' _^^___^^_^_
WHERE IT`S COLD
A Country Where a Lighted Candle I
Finds It Hard to Keep Warm.
Cold is merely a relative term. The |
resident of semi-tropical countries shivers j
when the thermometer falls to 50 degrees, i
while the Laplander and Eskimo think it !
is comfortable at zero.
For real cold, and plenty of it, one must
go to the polar regions. Think of living
where the mercury goes down to 35 de
grees below zero in the house, in spite of !
the stove. Of course, in such a case, fur j
garments are piled on until a man looks !
liKe a great bundle of Bkins.
Dr. Moss, of the polar expedition of j
1875-76, among other odd things, tells"of i
the effect of cold on a wax candle which j
he burned there. The temperature was 35 j
degrees below zero; and the doctor must!
have been considerably discouraged when, j
looking at his candle, he discovered that i
the flame had all it could do to keep ;
warm.
It was so cold that the flame could not â¢
melt all the wax of the but was !
forced to cut its way down, leaving a sort i
of skeleton of the candle standing.
There was heat enough, however, to melt j
oddly shaped holes in the thin walls of
wax, and the result was a beautiful lace- I
like cylinder of white, with a tongue of
yellow flame burning inside it, and send
ing out into the darkness many streaks of
light.â Popular Science Newa.

"Lows'' usually first appear on the Washinston

the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V.. June 15.â A more hopeful
feeling prevailed in stock circles to-day and the
market broadened considerably. There was good
buying for both borne and foreign account, and in
the late trading the shorts, who cad been fighting
the rii-e all day long, fell into line. London buying
cut a figure in the dealings and the orders em
braced a wider range than of late. Total sales
footed ud.; 226,500 shares. The underlying cause
for the increased activity ana thÂ« improvement In
prices .right through the list was the impression
afterward confirmed by Senator Lodge that the
st. Coni* 1 Convention would put a gold plank in
the platform. r
The gain in prices was equal to Vi@ /4 .per cent
and was well distributed, A feature of the trading
was the absorp ion of . high-priced stocks' and the
ensÂ« with which, these stocks moved up on light
offerings, Lackawanna rising to 164. Lake Shore
to 153% and Consolidated (Jus to 368. The strength
of Sugar was .the subject of comment. In view of
the reduction of 1-I6c per pound in re
fined ' and - the ' demoralized condition of
the- market â for raws Â«hioal. The stock
opened a: ; 120%@>121% ex dividend ot 3
per c "tit and advance . steadily to 123%, brokers
identified with lower Wall-street interests being
the lar test buyers. . . .
The.report of an extra dividend on the common
was again revived. The Internationals,' Anthra
cite Coalers and the specla ties were all taken on
the way up, and the feeling at the close was more
confident than for a long time. Net changes show
advances of %@% per cent outside of. Rubber
which lost 1% per cent.
Bonds were active and strong. The sales were
81.650.0U0. Government bonds were higher and

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Ilk, June 15.â The wheat crowd
went home long of wheat on Saturday, hoping
that something favorable to prices would develop
over Sunday. The desired encouragement not
being in evidence this morning, all the wheat so
held came on the market to the disadvantage of
values. Heavy world's shipments were estimated,
the authentic amount, with Russia missing, being
4,322.000 bushels. That country was unofflclally
reported to have shipped 4,000.000 bushels. The
visible supply was a disappointment of the great
est kind to holders, showing as it did a decrease of
but 661.0 0 bushels where 2.U00.000 reduction
was expected. The amount on ocean passage in
creased 1.600.000 bushels.
Liverpool cables were %d lower. Receipts in
the Northwest were heavy at 516 cars, against
645 last Monday and 235 a year aÂ«o. Chicago re
ceived fourteen cars and inspected out 62,000
bushels. Closing Continental cables were generally
lower. The English visible supply increased 400,
-000 bushels. Export clearances were light at 194,
-400 bushels. The market recovered during the
latter portion of thÂ« session mpinly on covering by
heavy short-sellers. July wheat opened from 66Vs
@56c, sold between 5534@555/ s c and s~s/ B e, clos
ing at 56% c, ss 8 c under Haturday. Estimated re
ceiptÃfor to-morrow, 35 cars.
CORNâ The inclination of corn was the same as
that of wheat, both through sympathy and by
reason of the statistical news. Receipts were
heavy at 4-0 cars and the output small at 71,800
bushels. Liverpool cables were %d lower. The
visible supply showed but a moderate decrease,
46 1,000 bushels, anil the amount on ocean passage
increased 320.000 bushels. The close was steady,
with September hanged from Sa'.nrday. That
option opened at 28% c, advanced to 29c, closing
at 28% c. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 525
cars.
OATSâ Trading in oats was but moderate, and
the feeling was weak In sympathy with the lead-
Ing grains. Receipts were 288 cars, and 140,900
bnsnels were taken from store. The visible sup
ply increased ' 115,300 bushels. Export clear
ances amounted to b9,6U0 bushels. July oats
closed Vs under Saturday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 350 cars.
FLAXâ Was easy. Cash, 81c: July, 80c, nomi
nal: September, 82c Receipts 19 cars.
PROVISIONSâ A small unimportant and unin
teresting business was transacted In product.
Under big receipts of hogs the market at the yards
was lower, and reflecting the tone at that place
pro.uct opened weak. A fair amount or buying
of a promiscuous sort served to steady the feeling a
little, however, and no serious break occurred.
July pork closed 5c lower, July lard a shade
lower, and July rib* 2%@5c lower.

Fiji Tattooing;.
It is quite common in Fiji and Samoa
for a man to bear npon his arm or body a
I certificate of his birth which is practically
1 indelible. Tattooing is carried on in these
islands to an absurd extent, and it is the
practice to tattoo on the hand of a mother
I the date of her children's birtns. Some
times, also, an enthusiastic father will tat
too the date of the birth on the child itself,
and no matter how long it lives, the certifi
cate will remain easily decipherable. In
some adjoining islands every child is tat
tooed, almost from bead to foot, upon its
completing ita twelfth year. The result is
very remarkable, especially if the child is
growing rapidly, so that the spaces be
tween the tattoo marks increase in size
year by year.â New York Mercury.
HE SAVED THE SUGAR
A Traveling Alan's Experience in a
Kansas Rural District.
The traveling man who always "Sun
days" in Kansas City when in the vicinity,
because his best girl lives there, was in a
cheerful frame of mind and told all the
stories he knew. One of them is, perhaps,
worthy of record :
"Last Wednesday," said he, "I was in a
little town down in Kansas. I took lunch
at the only restaurant in the town. I or
dered a dish of strawberries and the waiter
brought me a heaping plate of them.
Fine berries they were, too. I was sur
prised at tke liberal quantity served and
said so."
" 'Cheapest thing we've got,' said the
waiter. â¢
"When I got ready to eat them, Hooked
around for the powdered sugar. The waiter
came to ma and said: 'Want powdered
sugar?' I said I did. and he went'away
and came back with a little powder gun,
such as they fire insect powder out of, from
which he squirted sugar over and into the
berries.
" 'Powdered sugar's mighty high,' said
he, 'an' berries be mighty cheap. We gen
erally sugar the berries ourselves when
they ask for sugar.'
" 'That's a new one on me,' says I.
it â¢Well, the boss is mighty close,' says
the waiter, 'an' has got to cut corners to
make a livin'. Some hogs used ter come
in here and put two spoonfuls of sugar on
a plate of berries, an' so he thinks up this
scheme.' "
The powdergun nas its advantages when
one powders on the economical Kansan's
device, because it squirts the sugar into
the crevices and puts some sugar on every
berry instead of all the sugar on the top
berries.â Kansas City Times.

BY DESPISED CATS
A Farmer's Happy Experi
ence in the Livermore
Valley.
NO POISON FOR GOPHERS
Colonizing Cats Proves a Perfect
Remedy Against Great
Evils.
NOT A PEST IN SIX YEARS.
Experience That Will Prove of Great
Benefit to Farmers and
Ranchers.
Oaklaxd Office San Feancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 15. f
A new system of protecting potato
ranches and orchards from the ravages of
squirrels and gophers has been tried in
the Livermore Valley and has proved a
great success.
Ths secret of the success is very simple
and consists solely of putting to a prac
tical use the common domestic cat.
Although many of the larger class of
farmers have resorted to poison, few know
or realize the value of a few good cats.
Arthur Small, a well-known farmer in
the eastern part of the county, has experi
mented for six years and is a great ad
mirer of the common cat, and for good
cause.
"Much of the hard-earned profits of the
Jarm go year after year in the expenditure
% for poison, in order to keep squirrels, and
pophers from destroying growing crops.
Not unly in the grainhelds is the work of
these depredators to be found, but also in
the garden, the cotato-patch and the
orchard. In some districts the rancher is
quite unequal to their onslaught, this
species of rodent being so numerically
strong and destructive that the farmer is
deterred from letting his crops ripen into
marketable grain, and is driven to the
necessity of cutting it all for hay in order
to save it.
"I will briefly relate my experience with
cats as an aid in place of poison. Several
years ago, when I first began farming in
my present location, after putting in a
small crop for hay. I planted a half-acre or
so in potatoes, and also a garden. When
the potatoes began to blossom and the
garden was in a nice condition the gophers
and squirrels went to work and cleaned
up everything in the garden-paten and
about half the crop of hay also. The fol
lowing year I planted the same patch in
potatoes and other vegetables, determined
to devise some way to save it from the
squirrels.
"Again the garden and crop grew lux
uriantly, and while I was contemplating
the putting out of poison my observation
became centered on the prompt and effect
ive work of a large cat I had on the ranch.
She had a couple of active kittens in the
barn, and whenever 1 was around I saw
her engaged in catching gophers and
squirrels for the family. As many as ten
squirrels were caught daily. Along with
the feeding of her kittens she was fre
quently waylaid by t!ie dogs, and the
squirrel would be taken from her. But
she was not discouraged and at once re
turned and got a fresh carcass, until both
the dogs and kittens thrived on her in
dustry.
"I did all I could to encourage the cat,
and soon put more to work, and for a long
time they have protected me entirely from
gophers and squirrels. Although there is
unoccupied land around my place, I hava
never used an ounce of poison in as. ex
perience of over six years, and 1 believe I
can show more land cleared up of squirrels
than my neighbors, who have poisoned
for years. I have no trouble with the cau
and no particular system, merely keeping
a box to answer for a home for the kittens,
keeping them out of the house anl only
feeding them in winter. With systematic
management; the despised house cat can
be made of inestimable value to farmers
troubled with these pests."
SECRET POLITICAL CLUBS
Berkeley Now Has Three to
Look After Municipal
Government.
Prospects of Lively Times When
Local Offices Are to Bs
Filled.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 15.â A new se
cret political society, similar to the Civic
F deration of West Berkeley, is said to
have been organized in East Berkeley.
The new society is declared 1o be one
formed for the purpose of taking a hand in
Jocal politics, ana as it is the third club of
the kind in the town, some lively wire
pulling may be txpected when t c time
comes for the election of successors to the
present town officers.
The new club claims fifty-seven mem
bers. Nothing is known of its constitu
tion or officers, other than that its objects
are declared to be to promote good gov
trnment.
â  Berkeley's two other secret political
clubs are the "Civic Federation," which
made its appearance daring the recent
campaign for school bonds, and the Good
Government Club, which has proved a
strong influence in past elections and is
believed to be a great power in the town.
The latter is not wholly secret, its mcm
i ers and officers and its constitution being
known.
â  Accidentally Shot. ,
'. BERKELEY, I'al., June 15.â A mem
ber of a parly of hunters from San Fran
cisco was shot in the neck on Addison

hills to the east of Berkeley, when one of
the guns was accidentally discharged. The
wound inflicted was not serious and the
hunters returned at once to San Francisco.

INCOME CURTAILED.
Ladies' Relief Society Will Have to Be
Assisted Through the Tear
Financially.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 15.â Mrs. F. S.
Stratton in her report as recording secre
tary of the Ladies' Relief Society shows
that the prosperity of the homes main
tained by that organization are threatened
and the time has come when the hearty
support of every friend is nteded to carry
them through the year. The repor: says:
At the present time what is our condition?
There is no dividend whatever from the Contra
Costa stock, the Slate has dropped $225 of its
monthly appropriation and our serious inroads
upon bank deposits at the time of building
have decreased by half our interest account,
which melts away toward the zero point as we
gradually kill the goose that lays the golden
egKs. Our buildings are large, sanitary, con
venient and substantial, but they have sadly
taxed our resources. We used not only the in
surance money but contributions personally
urged from friends, the legacy left oy Mrs. de
Fremery and the greater part of that left by
Dr. Merritt. So we are to face the situation
with a present monthly income of $600 and a
monthly expense account of $1100.

vices about the streets, but there is noth
ing in it regarding devices on wagons,

range in" that method of advertising.
Colonel Lyon will sppear in court to
morrow as chief advocate for the defense
when the boy's case is called in the Police
Court.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 16, 1896.
Down the Steep Grade Flew the Heavy Double-Decked Car, and While Passengers Waited and
Wondered the Man Who Should Have Looked Out for Their Lives at the Brake Was Collecting
Nickels on the Upper Deck.
TRUSTING LIFE
TO MERE CHANCE
Wild Midnight Ride on
the Highland Park
Railroad.
FLEW DOWN A GRADE.
The Motorman Was Collecting
Nickels on the Upper
Deck.
NOT A HAND NEAR THE BRAKES
Women Anxiously Watched the
Heavy Car Approach a Dan
gerous Curve.
Oakland Office. San Francisco Call,[
908 Broadway, June 15. j
Everything is ready for a fearful accident
at Buelah Park, and if it should occur the
loss of life will be great.
Last night about fifty passengers expe
rienced the wildest ride on an electric-car
that they ever bad in their lives, or will
ever willingly take again. For several
minutes they flew through the air entirely
at the mercy of a steep grade and chance.
The cars have been taking such journeys
quite often, but this particular ride will
not soon be forgotten. Sensible people
will hardly credit that such a practice is
tolerated anywhere.
At 11 o'clock at night car No. 6 loaded
up with passengers at the entrance to Beu
lah Park. This car is a monster affair and
both decks were well patronized. The
majority of them were women, and not a
few had young children with them. After
a start was made the motorman-conductor
left his post and went into the body of tne
car to take up the fare 3.
Just after leaving the park there is a
steep grade with a swerve that ends at the
Commerce-street power-house. The car
gained rapid momentum and everybody
looked fearfully at the track, not knowing
how soon a rock or some obstacle might
be encountered.
After taking up the fares in the body of
the car the motorman, to everybody's sur
prise and horror, rushed to the upper d ck.
The car increased its speed as it flew by
the masts, and not a hand was there to
check it.
"Where is the motorman?" yelled one
woman. But he did not hear; he was on
the top of the car collecting nickels.
After rushing through tne air for orer a
mile at a speed that caused people to hold
their breath a curve was sighted.
EMIL NUSBAUMER.
"Oh, mamma." said a young lady to her
parent, "will he stop this car before it
strikes that curve?"
Ju*t as the wheels struck the curve the
motorman rushed down stairs, through
the car and grabbed the brake, to the in
expressible relief of everybody. It is im
possible to estimate the speed at which the
car was traveling, but it was far greater
than any car ever travels when a motor
man is on duty.
This road is one that needs particular
care. It runs through a lonely part of the
county and tramps are frequently in that
neighborhood. A few months ago the
roadbed was obstructed three times in one
nieht, and it was attributed to tramps.
Should anything of the kirid occur when
the motorman is away from his post the
immense car would be ditched to a cer
tainty and a fearful fatality would follow.
Had there been a few more nickels to
collect last night on the top deck the car
would have struck the curve before its wild
flight was arrested, and it is only a few
days since a car in East Oakland struck a
curve and seriously wounded several peo
ple. And this was on an upgrade.
At the present time there is a largely
attended camp-meeting in progress at
Beulah Park and the cars of the Highland
Park road are frequently loaded to dis
comfort. Some of the cars are tne heaviest
of the kind in the country. They have
two decks and an awning over the upper
deck. When the upper deck is loaded the
leverage is great, but it is always consid
ered safe on account of the great weight of
the motors between the wheels.
For a long time there has only been one
man to run these heavy electric cars. The
patrons have often complained Dut with
no result. An ordinance that was recently
considered by the City Council which
made it imperative on street car compan
ies to have two men on each car, but the
measure was not finally passed.

FAILED TO SEE TRIPLETS
After They Had Gone to the Trouble
of Buying Presents and Making
a Call.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. June 15. j
A man was horsewhipped last evening
on the Redwood road, and a deputy con
stable went to the scene in a hurry, but
found that he was too late.
The victim of the encounter was John
Harwood, and it will be a long time before
he again resorts to practical joking when
telling his neighbors about additions to
his family.
About a week ago a little boy made its
appearance at tne Harwood home, which
is a pretty little place on the Redwood
road. Harwood lelt very proud, natur
ally, and when he went downtown he
told his friends. The conversation was
something like this:
"Well, Harwood, shake I What is it?"
"Boy," said Harwood dejectedly.
"That's nothing," said the friend.
"And two girls," said Harwood more de
jectedly. â 
The story that triplets had arrived in tne
neighborhood was generously circulated.
It was construed as a i appy omen for the
district, and a general surprise party was
immediately arranged for. Harwood's
friends and relatives joined hands, and
bought presents for the happy youngsters
and the happier parents. They went to
the house expecting to have considerable
fun and merry-making.
Yesterday afternoon was the time set
for the picnic, and accordingly all went to
the Harwood home under the guidance of
Mrs. Smith, a sister-in-law.
They saw Mrs. Harwood, but to their
great sorrow and surprise there waÃ only
one baby, a brignt little boy. Inquiry was
made for the others, and the mother
quietly, and withal somewhat indignantly,
replied that one was all.
Then the chagrined visitors told of what
they had heard and departed. On their
way to the Fruitvale cars they knew they
would meet Harwood returning from his
work. He always rides a bicycle to and
from town and so the disappointed friends
quickly hit upon a plan to return the
practical joke played on them. Some of
the ladies who were little known to Har
wood armed themselves with switches and
sunshades and laid in wait.
As soon as Harwood approached the
ladies rushed upon him and commenced
to belabor him with their weapons. Ha
was not hurt and after a few moments he
detected the joKe. Some farmers who
were passsing went to his assistance but
found that their services were not needed.
However, they reported the matter and
the Fruitvale constable went post-haste to
the scene. There was nothing to see, but a
little of what newspaper men call "dig
ging" brought out the truth.
A Dead- head Cat.
The most unusual trip that a cat ever
r i ade voluntarily was made by a Dunellen
(N. J.) cat yesterday. When the early
morning train on the Central Railroad was
standing at Dunellen a large white cat,
which was chased by a dog, ran under one
of the cars and jumped upon a truck near
the king-bolt, close under the car floor.
The train was soon started and the cat
still remained there. When the train was
ready to start back irora Jersey City at 5
o'clock in the afternoon, Charles Dodwell,
the conductor who brings it back to Dun
ellin, saw the cat still on the trucks and
thought if she was enjoying the ride he
would not ask for her ticket.
She came home in the same seat. When
the train arrived in Dunellen the cat
jumped from her perch and scampered off*

FIGHTING FOR A
LEAGUE OF UNO
First of the Notorious Noe
Suits on Before Judge
Sanderson.
SPANISH LAW INVOLVED
A Grant From Governor Pio
Pico Declared to Be Com
munity Property.
THEY CHANGED THELE MINDS
Plaintiff's Attorneys Closed Their
Case, but Concluded to Unclose
It and Try Again.
The trial of the long-pending Noe suit
is on at last. When order was called in
Judee Sanderson's courtroom yesterday
morning it looked as though the San
Francisco bar had turned out to give his
Honor a surprise party. Every available
chair within hearing distance of the bench,
not excluding those in the jury-box, was
occupied by a lawyer. The prospect of
such an array of legal lore must have been
lather embarrassing to Judge Sanderson,
and he announced that the first thing to
be done was to ascertain just who each
attorney represented. In order to facili
tate matters he announced that all parties
interested in any of the three Noe suits, of
which the one on trial is the first and from
a standpoint of value the most important,
would be allowed to make an appearance.
To this Attorney Koscialowski objected
and was allowed the consolation of an ex
ception.
In the suit now on trial there are 250 de
fendants. Of these nearly 200 are repre
sented by Lane & Lane. Judge E. W.
McKinstry appears as the champion of
Mayor Sutro's interests, E. S. Pillsbury
represents Homer Kins; of Wells, Fargo &
Co., Morrison and Foerster appear for the
Crocker estate, Michael Mullaney for
Behrend Joost, R. T. Harding for the Cali
fornia Title Insurance Company, A. P.
Van Duser the Mission Defense Club, and
James If. Taylor, E. J. Pringle, W. S.
Goodfellow, Shadburne & Herrin, A. C.
Freeman and T. V. O'Brien represent in
dividual defendants.
Opposed to this phalanx of talent are P.
L. Koscialowski and A. V. Splivalo. The
numerical inequality of the contest was
apparently felt by the plaintiff's attor
ney, for though having the aggressive
side of the case he was most of the time
acting upon the defensive, the small army
of his opponents being constantly on the
alert for an opening.
The present action is founded upon a
claim which has for years caused occa
sional fear aruone the more timid prop
erty-owners of the Mission.
The claim is based upon a grant made
by Pio Pico, the last Mexican Governor of
California, to Jose Jesus Noe. It was j
given in answer to a petition filed by Jose |
in which he set forth that he needed the |
land for the support of his family. In 1848 j
Noe's wife died, and soon thereafter, but '
before the annexation of the State, Noe j
deeded the land to Charles B. Stroude.
Through him it passed through several
owners to those who are now in posses
sion.
So far the parties to the suit are agreed. |
The entire contention in the case is one of |
law, namely : Did Noe have a right to con- j
vey the entire property, as he attempted '
to do? The proposition of the plaintiffs,
who are the heirs of Guadalupe Xoe. Jose
Jesus Noe's wife, is that the grant was of \
community property.
By the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, '
ratified one year after the annexation of j
California, all land grants which were
good under the Mexican regime were to
be held valid at United States' law. Under
the Spanish law in regard to community !
property, which has been adopted by this '
State, all property acquired by the hus- I
band during marriage, except such as is >
acquired "by gift, bequest or descent, 1 ' is
community property.
The question then is whether or not
such a grant as the one to Don Jose Jesus
Noe is within the exception. In this State
it is universally considered that a grant
would not be community property, but
the plaintiffs in this case claim that by its
nature the grant was intended to be for
the community, and was so specified in i
the petition. This tney will argue will j
bring it within the law.
The first witness put on by the plaintiff
was C. C. Hopkins. Mr. Hopkins had pre
pared a translation of the petition of Jose
Noe and the grant of Pio Pico. He was
asked to swear to the correctness of his
translation. In one instance he ventured
to explain that there might be a shade of
doubt about the meaning of one word.
It hapy>ened that this particular doubt
was in regard to the operative way of the
grant, and instantly the venerable scholar
found himself the target of a volley of
queries. To the best of his ability Mr.
Hopkins tried to explain why the Spanish I
of conveyance might mean either grant or i
donate, and how it was that both these
words meant just the same thing. He
conjugated in Spanish and compared it
with the Latin. Then he made some nice
English distinctions, and still the attor
neys refused to be satisfied. At Americen

law grant means just a little more than
donate, and they were anxious to know
just how it is in Spanish. At last Judge
Sanderson's patience became exhausted.
He said the interpretation of that word
was a question of law. He understood it
and would listen to no more argument on
the matter.
Another skirmish occurred when the
next witness was called. Koscialowski
explained that the witness, Mrs. Miguel
j Xoe, could not speak English, and he of
fered to put John Irwin on as interpreter.
Then the defendant's objected vigorously.
They didn't know Irwin, and for a
language that bad such fine distinctions,
as shown by Hopper between "grant" and
"donate," he thought there should be an
interpreter known to be impartial. Judge
Sanderson, who expressed a desire to
facilitate matters, suggested that liwin
be examined. Chadburne consented and
Irwin was sworn. He said he had known
Vincent Noe ever since he was born, and
felt very friendly toward the family. He,
however, denied any interest in the case,
and over an objection by Van Duser he
was allowed to proceed.
" Mrs. Miguel Noe, or Gallerma Viscarra
de Noe as she called herself, testified that
her husband was the son of Jose Jesus and
Guadalupe di Noe. She said he was now
in Mexico. Van Duser asked if he was not
now a fugitive from justice, but the ques
tion was overruled. The witness was then
called upon to identify a record of deaths
in a family Bible which she said had be
longed to her husband. Chadburne de
manded to see the oook, and after consul
tation with Van Duser objected that the
entries referred to as deaths were in reality
entries of births. The interpreter ex
plained that though under the printed
word births they were nevertheless all en
tries of deaths.
Koscialowski stated that the object of
the record was to prove the death of Jose
Jesus Noe, in 18G2. and Guadalup? Noe in
j April 1848. The defendant's attorneys,
Van Duser excepted, offered to concede
this. Van Duser stated he would concede
j nothing. "Let it be entered," ruled his
H onor, "that all consent except Mr. Van
Duser. who is overruled."
The witness then proceeded to explain
j the relationship of the four plaintiffs in
i this case to the deceased Guadalupe Noe,
I through whom they claim Miguel, her
husband, she explained, is the only son.
Catilina Spivoia, Vmcento Noe and Cata
lina Noe are grandchildren. The last
three were each put upon the stand to tes
tify to the same facts. Rev. Father Pren
dergast and Rev. Father Gleason were
j called upon to still further complete the
identification. Certificates of baptism
were introduced to the same end.
Against objections by Judge McKinstry
and G. W. Lane the plaintiff was allowed
to introduce a patent of the United States
confirming the title of Jose Jesus Noe to
i the land in controversy. The objection
j was based on the ground of irrelevancy, as
â  all parties concerned claim under Noe's
title, and hence it is not disputed.
Attorneys Kocialowski and Spivalothen
declared their case closed. Confusion
reigned for a few minutes as each of the
defendants' attorneys struggled to be
heard. They had evidently not expected
such a termination of the plaintiff's case
and they were disconcerted. Attorney
Chadbourne insisted that the plaintiff
should be compelled to prove the actual
title under which they claimed. The deed
of the property made by Noe should, he
declared, have been put in evidence.
Judge Sanderson said he had no knowl
edge of any deed and could not compel
the plaintiff to put on anything of detri
i ment to his case. Van Duser declared there
were material variances between the alle
gations and the proof. Lane said there
had been but one thing proved, and that :
was the patent from the United States I
confirming the grant of Pio Pico to Noe,
which no one denied. Judge McKinstry
was of the opinion that no case had been
made out, and Judge Freeman echoed this
opinion.
Without passing upon the various sug
gestions, for they were hardly more, Judge
Sanderson said the case would go over un
til to-day at 10 a. m Then Koscialowski
explained that there was a string attached
to his closing. If the remainder of his
case was to be considered as a question of
law he was through, if it was a question of
fact he wanted more time. His Honor
said he did not see exactly what the attor
ney meant, but he would suggest that he
get in all his facts and let the law take
care of itself. Koscialowski then said he
would like an hour and a half more. The
case then went over until this morning.
The plaintiff's attorneys expect to disclose
their case in answer to a motion for a non*
suit which they expect. Mr. Kocialowski
says he will then have some surprises. At j
present the attorneys for the defendant
feel that the suit is already won.
CARNIVAL OUTLAY.
The Money Will Mostly Go Into the
Pockets of the Working
People.
In order that the mechanics and trades
! people may derive all the benefit possible
j from the $100,000 which the executive com
| mittee of the Carnival of the Golden Gate
intend to expend a general invitation is to
be extended to them to submit designs of
floats and other paraphernalia requisite in
presenting the various features.
These suggestions were fully considered
at the meeting held at the Mills building
yesterday afternoon. The matter was
brought about by a communication from
W. H. Mills, who suggested that as the
entire occasion was projected for the pur
pose of adding life, elation and pleasure to
the people of the city and to those who
witness or participate in the festivities,
I and as it would also be a costly affair, he
! thought that the work should be confined
entirely to the community in the way of
employing those who should do it.
General Warneld . will appoint a com
mittee to confer with the various labor
organizations, lay out the plan of the car
nival in detail to them, give them an idea
of the class of work that tney will be I
called upon to do , and inform them of i
the approximate amount that will be ex
pended for labor. Mr. Mills and General
Backus will formulate during the coming
week an address to the people of the City, i
giving the outlines of the reasons for the
carnival, which will connect the occasion j
with the best interests of the City, present
and prospective. \
The various features embodied in the '
programme were discussed at length, with â¢
a view to ascertaining how much money
could be expended directly among the
working people by the committee.
Oscar Boldeman, I. L. Rosenthal and
David Rich were appointed as a commit- ,
tee on entertainment to visit the different |
places of amusement and arrange with I
them for benefits for the carnival fund, j
The. offer of the Columbia Theater, made
some time ago, will be at once taken up
and to Friedlander & Gottlob of that place
of amusement will be given the honor, in
view of ; their being the first to suggest a
benefit, of being the first subscribers to the
fund. They have kindly placed the entire
company, theater and appurtenances at
the disposal of the committee, and have
also promised a programme of rare merit.

WED IN THE HEART
OF THE SUMMER
Nuptials of Miss Claire
Tucker and Philip
Williams.
WAS A QUIET AFFAIR.
The Swellness of the Principals
and Their Popularity Made
It Interesting.
AMID ST. JOSEPH LILIES.
Relatives Only Witnessed the Im
pressive Ceremonyâ Bridal Trip
to Honolulu.
Only relatives and a limited number of
intimate friends witnessed the ceremony
which united Miss Claire Tucker, daughter
of the late J. C. Tucker, and Philip Wil-
Mr. and Mrs. Philip Williams (formerly Miss Claire Tncker).
Hams, son of Mr. and Mrs. Harry A. Wil
liams.
The wedding was celebrated last evening
at 8 o'clock at the residence of the bride's
mother, 2114 Vallejo street, the Rev. Dr.
Moreland of St. Luke's orh dating.
At an improvised altar, draped in soft
; folds of white India silk and decked with
St. Joseph lilies, the young couple knelt
during the impressive Episcopal service.
The decorations of the home were artistic
and beautiful, pink and white being the
prevailing tones. In the drawing-room,
where the ceremony was performed, nu
merous wreaths of t)ink and white sweet
peas adorned the walls at regular inter
vals, suspended by long streamers of |
dainty bow-knotsof pink and white taffeta i
ribbon.
In the artistic corner cornucopias filled
to overflowing with white and pink
blossoms were suspended from the ceiling,
and in the long drawing-room there was
an artistic arrangement of choice blossoms
in rare and costly vases.
The charming young bride looked ex
tremely lovely in her handsome bridal
gown of cream-white satin. The jupe was
made perfectly plain, en train, and the
high-necked corsage ornamented with a
fall of duchess lace. A wreath of orange
i blossoms confined the long bridal-veil to
the coiffure. The only ornament worn
was a string of pearls, from which de
pended a handsome pearl cross.
The bride was attended by her sister,
Miss Mase Tucker, and Emanuel Heller
! officiated as best man.
The maid of honor wore a dainty gown
of white silK, trimmed with chiffon.
After the ceremony an elaborate supper
was served.
Mr. and Mrs. Williams leave this morn
ing for a bridal trip to Honolulu.
There were theater-parties galore last
evenine. The only wonder was that with

MARY E. REDMAN
WANTS HIS MONEY
She Sues Capitalist Thomas
Carter for Breach of
Promise.
ASKS $50,000 DAMAGES.
He Says He Paid Her $5000
Once as a Compromise
Sum.
ROMANCE FIFTEEN TEARS LONG
Mr. Carter Says He Has Given the
Young Lady in All Over $15,0*00,
and Will Fight New.
A suit for $50,000 damages for breach of
promise of marriage was begun in the
Superior Court yesterday afternoon against
Thomas Carter, capitalist and carbuilder.
The complainant is Miss Mary E. Red
man, a plump and pretty brunette. She
ought to be a capitalist, too, if Mr. Carter's
story of the amount of money he has
given her in the last twelve years is borne
out by the facts. Miss Kedman's address
is at 502 Mason street and her occupation
is given as a dressmaker.
Accounts differ also as to whether Miss
Redman is pretty. Heroines in breach of
promise cases are, as a rule, handsome,
but Mr. Carter said last evening that she
is a "coarse and common person addicted
to looking on wine too often when it is
red." The landlady at 602 Mason street,
however, said that Miss Redman is a "nice
little girl about 30 years of age, and just
too sweet for anything."
Not desiring to meet reporters, and re
questing her attorney not to give them her
aduress, which request was complied with
with professional strictness, Miss Redman
rushed to her room about 4 o'clock yester
day afternoon, hurriedly packed up a few
things and left word that she was off for
Salinas on a visit to friends. The landlady
professed surprise and ignorance of the
suit for damages, and said she did not
know when Miss Redman would return.
Thomas Carter is a member of the firm
i of Carter Brothers, carbuilders and gen
[ eral railroad contractors, at Newark, Cal.
[ He has resided in this City for years at 6
Turk street. He has been in business in
San Francisco and vicinity for twenty-five
years and is well known here and among
railroad rrfen all over the State. He built
the narrow-gauge railroad loop to Santa
Cruz.
Mr. Carter is about 50 years old and a
single man. He has a long sandy beard
and there are "silver threads among the
gold." If there were more gray hairs in
his beard Mr. Carter would present quite
a patriarchal appearance.
In an interview last evening with a Call
reporter he emphatically denied ever
promising to marry Miss Redman and de
clared flatly that it was simply a black- j
mailing scheme. He said he had once
paid Miss Redman $5000 to shut her pretty
mouth and prevent puohcity of their rela
tions, but.be declared, somewhat in the
language of Patrick Henry, that he had
"millions for defense, but not a cent for
tribute."
"I paid her $5000 once," he said, "and I
have her receipt for the amount in full
settlement of everything. I've got the
money to pÂ«y, but I'll spend $50,000 in de
fending the case rather than give it to
her."
Mr. Carter met Miss Redman about
twelve or fifteen years ago at the well
known waterine place, Byron Springs. She
was spending some time there with her
uncle, J. D. Horan, who keeps the stock
yards at Tenth and Bryant streets. They
spent many hours full of shade and bright
sunshine and seductive moonlight alone
together, and out of those meetings of the
happy summer-time long ago grew the
romance whose closing chapter was filed
yesterday in court.
"We have met often since," said Mr.
Carter. "She has been with me a great
deal, though we never actually lived to
gether. She has visited me in my apart
ments. During recent years she got into
bad company and has been drinking too
much to maintain the proper decorum.
She would come up to my rooms in this
condition and when it was not convenient
for me to meet her, and she became a.n
embarrassment to me. The landlord will
bear me out in this. I have called him to
put her out of my rooms."
"Was she led astray by you in the first
place?"
"Not at all; no, sir. I think I can prove
that if necessary. She was not innocent
when I met her at Byron Springs."
"As to the previous compromise?"
"On account of her conduct I told her,"
Mr. Carter said, "not to come to my room
any more, as I did not want to have any
thing more to do with her. Then she
threatened to bring suit for damages, and
1 compromised with her for $5000, for the
reason I have stated. A man who is now
a Superior Jud.e of this City and County
was one of the lawyers in the settlement.
He knows all about it. She owed me $000
in a real estate deal, for which I held her
note, and between $200 and $300 borrowed
money. I compromised with her for $5000,
less the amount of the note and the bor
rowed money. She received my check for
$4100. This was about two years ago.
"Now, along she comes again with an
other claim," Mr. Carter said , "and at
tempts to bleed me a second time. I tell
you I'll not have it. I won't pay a cent.
I've consulted four lawyers, and 1 do not
think I shall be compelled to. This was
after I received a note from her attorney,
Judge Highton, a few days ago, telling me
that the suit was about to be Drought. I
went up to see Highton and told him the
whole story.
"Since I paid that money, two years
ago," resumed Mr. Carter, "I have had
nothing to do with the young woman. I
have met her on the streets several times
and conversed with her whenever she be
haved properly.
"She has dogged my lootsteps, and
stood across the corner there," he said,
pointing to Turk, Mason and Market
streets, ''in order to catch me and speak to
me. She was right up here on Mason
street, corner of Post. She often said that
she desired to consnlt me about real estate
transactions, and I advised her when I
could. But our relations have not been
more intimate than that for two years."
"How much money have you given Miss
Redman since you have known her?"
"In all 1 should say $15,000 or $16,000,"

She has come to my room in the morning,

A "LOST GIRL" STORY.
How Osmond Day Deceived and
Deserted Two Country
Victims.
One Accepted Her Fate Silently, but
the Other Tried tc Commit
Suicide.
Lillie O'Neal is the name of the latest
victim of the notorious Osmond Day. It
was she who tried to commit suicide in a
room at 21 Turk street Sunday night.
When questioned at the Receiving Hos
pital she was tiaif delirious from the
effects of the chloroform she had drunk
and answered that her name was Bebbie
Griegs, which is the name of Day's Santa
Rosa victim. The O'Neal girl is from
Petaluma. This tenderloin character,
Day, prefers the country.
These two girls fell'into Day's hands
several months ago in the same manner
human lambs fall to the tender mercies of
inhuman wolves, and the story is a tale
too often told for many reasons. Accord
ing to the O'Neal girl's account Day and
his two youthful victims met in this City
and their journey downward was all the
speedier from nis near presence. Once
Bebbie Griggs became ill and LUlie
O'Neal's money, earned in shame, went to
buy medicine for her sister in misfortune.
Both girls are exceedingly pretty. They
are the daughters of estimable parents
who will never cease to mourn their chil
dren's destruction.
Day first cast off the Santa Rosa girl
atid finally the Petaluma victim. One ac
cepted her fate in silence, but LillieO'Neil,
who is infatuated with her betrayer, at
tempted to commit suicide by drinking
chloroform Sunday night. She was taken
to the Receiving Hospital, calling upon
the name ot tne wretch in her delirium.
She knowing that her complete shame
would soon be known pleaded with him
to marry her, but he spurned her and said
he was married already.
This made her desperate, and she took a
room at 21 Turk street to kill herself in.
At the Receiving Hospial yesterday
morning she stated that she still loved
him and was fully determined to die. She
detailed the dreary tale of her fall and of
meeting her partner in ruin. About noon
she left the hospital with a woman com
panion vowinc that she would complete
her work of self destruction.
For the benefit of the relatives of the
girls, Day can be found almost any hour
in the vicinity of Turk and Taylor streets.
Day Driven From Santa Rosa.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., June 15.â Mr.
Griggs received several telegrams , from
San Francisco friends assuring him that
his daughter was alive and well and had
made no suicidal attempt. The yonng
lady who courted death upon being aban
doned by the unsavory masher was a
Petaluma girl.
Osmond Day is well and unfavorably
known here, where he posed for some
time as an English Lord. His career was
short, however, lie being recognized by a
gentleman familiar with his record, and
he was at odco warned to leave town on .
pain of arrest.
