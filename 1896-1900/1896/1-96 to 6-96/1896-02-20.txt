VOLUME LXXIX.-NO. 82.
GOEBEL'S BILL
NEXT IN ORDER
The Discussion on Repeal
May Begin To-day in
Frankfort.
BITTER FIGHT EXPECTED
Huntington's Forces Will Seek to
Delay Action by Making
Long Speeches.
SENATOR HAYS' DECLARATION.
Opposes the Repeal Measure Because
the Magnate Has Long Been
His Friend.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. lfl.-Thcre is
but one bill of importance ahead of the
bill to repeal the Southern P.icitic charter
in the Senate. This is the house of reform
bill, which has been made a special order
for 11 o'clock to-morrow. Respite the
shrewd tactics of Huntington'* managers
in taking an active parts in all debates in
these measures in their fight for time un
der the guise of interest in the bills, the
friends of the repeal bill hope to force the
light and shut off debate in time to dispose
of these matters and have t!ie bill come
Dp before the end of to-morrow's session.
Lengthy debates are expected by Senator
Hays and his Huntington friends against
the bill and Senator Goebel for the meas
ure, and the fight will v/arm up to a high
pitch before the bill is passed in the upper
branch.
Two sessions a day have already begun
to be talked of, and are expected to begin
in the House some time next week. The
news is hailed with delight Dy friends of
the repeal bill, who will lend hearty aid
to the move, as it will greatly facilitate
the measure. Huntington's managers are
Keeping shy, but the strong tight they are
putting up to defeat the bill is every day
more apparent.
â¢â¢I am opposed to Senator Goebel's bill,
cr any other looking to the repeal of the
Southern Pacific Company's charter," said
Senator Hays this morning, as he stood in
the lobby of the Senate cnamber, "because
Mr. Huntington lias been a friend of mine
for many years, and I do not believe it
just that the Legislature of Kentucky
should repeal a charter that it granted
years a^i and unner which great enter
prises have been projected and set on foot.
For tneh large undertakings vast capital
is required, and a great many persons are
interested as stockholders. To repeal
the ciiarter would necessarily cause great
â .A distress among them.
"The people of California should protect
themselves through the courts ana their
Kailroad Commission, 'eend to eend,' and
v e are going to beat it, too, in the Senate,
and beat it badly. It should never have
been introduced."
The major seemed a bit conscious that
an ancient friendship with Mr. Hunting
ton, and the consequent employment of
free passes and other privileges on his
roads, were not such reasons for his action
as would entirely satisfy his constituents
and the public generally, but they were
the best he had, and so he gave them, with
his argumentative conclusions to back
them up. When he said, "Let the people
of California protect themselves through
the courts and the Kailroad Commission,"
he did not mean to be so sarcastic, as that
is not the major's way. He oniy meant
that the interests and the wishes of the
large body of his fellow-countrymen now
groaning under the .burdens put upon
them by Huntington <fc Co. were a second
ary consideration with him so long as he
enjoyed the friendship of the atomic
souled old man.
That intimacy has been a valuable one
to the major. It saves him at least 00
cents a day m railroad fare in and out to
his place on the C. O. & S. W. road.
The major was the subject of a scathing
editorial in the Louisville Evening Post
the other day in which he was charged
with misrepresenting niscity and repudia
ting his party by his course in the Sena
torial contest and with pursuing the same
with a view of making trades of votes for
certain purposes. It winds up by Baying
that "it is another and a final illustration
of Mr. Hayes 1 unfitness for any public
service â an unb'tness that was discovered
years ago. When this district refused to
â end him to Congress, though he did have
the Democratic nomination. Had he the
reeard for his constituents that he pro
fesses, Mr. Hayes would resign at once."
Well, not much! Mr. Huntington wants
the major there and tne major will stay.
Tneir antagonism on the Senatorial race
has developed some unfriendly feeling
between Mr. "Weissinger and Major Hayes,
which it is to be hoped will have its effect
when the repeal bill comes up and keep
"Weissinger rather in the lukewarm state
as far as giving a hearty support to the ef
forts of the major against it is concerned.
Senator C. C. AicChord of Springfield,
Ky., wno is warm in his support of tue re ;
ieal bill, has introduced a bill himself
looking to the protection of the people by
enlarging the powers of the Railroad Com
mission of which he was lately a member.
He ie a fine lawyer and a popular man and
will lend Goebel very material assistance.
He knows something of Huntington's
methods from his former experience and
the influx of an additional force of lobby
ists to fight his bill will only put him more
on his mettle and fix him firmly on Goebel's
tide.
The supporters of Senator Blackburn,
while not surprised at tl^e tenor ol Secre
tary Carlisle's letter declining to assist
lilackburn in the Senatorial fight, are
nngry as hornets orer the cool and delib
erate rebuff they have received. The re
f'llt of it is to widen the breach between
the respective factions on the financial
stion in this State and also to intensify
i lie feeling between the party and the Sec
mary. The gold men are jubilant over
Mr. Carlisle's course and say that had he
lent Blackburn a helping hand it would
have been no use to attempt to send a

Convention.
The joint assembly had trouble at the
start to-day over a supposed pair between
Senators Bowling (R.)and Walker (D.),
as a misunderstanding arose over it, and
when Senator Bowling answered to his
name a dozen Democrats arose and chal
lenged his right to respond. Considerable
excitement prevailed for the time, but in
the meantime Mr. Walker came into the
hali and straightened matters out.
The twenty-sixth ballot resulted: Hun

In an interview to-day Dr. Godfrey
Hunter, Republican nominee for United

time that he was for "sound" money. Mr.
Hunter said :

Secretary Carlisle's Heply to the Appeal
J'rnni Kentucky Democrats*
WASHINGTON, I). C, Feb. 19.â The
text of Secretary Carlisle's letter to the
Kentucky Democracy, reference to which
has been made in Kentucky dispatches to
The Call, is as follows:
Gentlemen: Your telegram, in which you ap

But even if this were not so, I have no right

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 19.â Senator
Allen of Nebraska to-day introduced a
resolution directing the Secretary of the
Interior to promptly issue to all purchas
ers of land granted by the United States
in aid of the construction of bond-aided
railroads or their assigns, patents for such
lands as have been earned and sold to
third parties when the said purchasers
have paid the United States the principal
and interest that may be due upon
their respective contracts, and money
arising therefrom shall be held by the
United States as a "trust fund" until such
time as the amounts due the United States
from said railroads shall be determined
and adjusted by Congress or other legal
authority. The receipts shall be deemed
as conclusive evidence of payment in all
Federal and State courts, as though thev
had been made to the railroad company in
the first instance.
Hereafter no road in arrears to the Gov

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 19.â The Los
Angeles County Council of Labor, repre
senting 6000 voters and twenty-seven dif
ferent trades unions.at a regular meeting to
night, adopted the following resolutions:
Whereas, We, as citizens of the common
wealth, are unalterably opposed to the con
tinuance of a monopoly which has for years
past systematically plundered the people,
bribed Legislatures and corrupted our judi
ciary; and whereas, the time is rapidly ap
proaching, when in the absence of a special
law passed in its interest, the mo
nopoly represented by C. P. Huntington
must cease; and wnereas, the paid lobby
ists of this source of notorious corruption
are at present thronging the halls of Congress,
endeavoring, by bribery and misrepresenta
tion, to induce the people's representatives to
enact a special law in the interest of the said
Huntington that he may continue to rob the
people of this State for another fifty years;
therefore, be it
Betolved, That we are unalterably opposed
to the funding of the Pacific Kailroad debt;
and furthermore, we demand that Mr. Hunt

for dollar.
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be
furnished the San Francisco Call.

Believes an Injustice Una Keen Done to
the Chief Clerk.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 19.-Judge
Maguire believes an injustice is being
done to C. C. Duckworth, chief clerk of
the Assembly of the last Legislature of
California. He said:
"Immediately after the passage of the
Belshaw resolution I received a copy of it
by telegraph signed 'James H. Budd,
Governor.' and presented it to the House
of Representatives. I also examined a
copy of the resolution yesterday on tho
files of the committee and find its purport
to have been telegraphed by the Gov

SETTLEMENT NEAR AT HAND.
The Method to Be Adopted Is All
That Remains to Be De
cided Upon.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 19.â The Daily
Chronicle wili to-morrow announce the
actual situation between Great Britain and
tne United States regarding the Venezue
lan boundary dispute thus:
"Great Britain is resoived to arbitrate the
Venezuelan boundarj' dispute directly
with the United States. The method to
be adouted and details of the settlement
are alone under consideration. The Gov
ernments are being urged by persons of
influence to conclude the settlement a3
speediiy as possible."
The Westminster Gazette publishes an
article urging Lord Salisbury not to further
delay the reply of Great Britain to the
proposal to appoint a joint British and
American Venezuelan commission. For
England, the Gazette says, there is great
advantage in settling the question with
the United States iustead of Venezuela.
.If America claims the dispute as her own,
she must assume the attendant liability of
becoming surety for Venezuela. England,
at least, has nothing to complain of.
The Pall Mall Gazette says that the Right

Admiralty, will announce the naval pro
gramme of the Government Monday. Be
sides the sum of Â£9,500,000, which will be
asked for the construction of four battle
ships, four first-class cruisers, four third
class cruisers and sixty torpedo-destroyers,
the Government will ask for a large vote
for guns and men.
The Times will to-morrow print a dis
patch from Caracas denying that the
authorities are in possession of official
knowledge of a direct settlement with
England of the Venezuelan-British Guiana
boundary dispute.
NATIVES BECOME TRAITORS.
Abyssinians Under Genera/ Baratieri's
Command Will Surrender Important
Positions.
NEW YORK, N. Y., Feb. 10.â A special
cable dispatcn to the Herale from Rome
says: Dispatches from the seat of war in
Abyssinia announce that a number of na
tive troops forming General Baratieri's ad
vance guard have revolted against the
Italians and intend to hand over impor
tant positions to the enemy.
This has rendered the situation much
more serious and proves the Italian com-
mander-in-chief to be absolutely wanting
in foresight. It is feared that this revolt
will have a bad effect on other native
allies.
The news has produced a very bad im
pression here. The Fanfulla expresses a
fear that there will be further defections
among the black troops, and that other
unpleasant surprises may be in store.
King Menelik is operating on a quad
rilateral formed by Asmara, Keren, Mas
sowah and his present camp. The offen
sive operations of the Abyssinians are be
coming more accentuated. A number of
outpost affairs have taken place, in which
the Italians have been successful.
It is evident that the Negus counts on
further defections among the native levies
on the Italian side. General Baratieri has
taken precautionary measures to prevent
this. A number of other generals are un
der orders to leave for the front.
FIRE CAUSES A PANIC.
Merrymakers at a Masked Ball Burned

LISBON, PoRTt-GAL, Feb. 19.â During
the progress of a masked ball given by the
Artists' Club of Santarem, a town fifty
miles from Lisbon, last night, at the close
of the carniral here, â fTt broke oat in the

frightful rapidity.
A terrible panic ensued and many of the
dancers and several outsiders who went to
their rescue were either burned to death
or latally crushed or trampled in the rush
to escape from the burning building.
Forty bodies have been recovered.

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa, Feb.
19.â A large quantity of dynamite exploded
at Viedendorph, a suburb of this city, this
evening, wrecking hundreds of houses in
the vicinity. All the window-Danes in
Johannesburg were broken by the con
cussion. It is feared that great loss of life
was caused by the explosion, and the

LONDON, Exg., Feb. 19.â Baron Oscar

tion, has expressed himself as being en
tirely skeptical regarding the alleged dis
covery of the north pole by the Dr. Nansen
expedition. The Fram, Dr. Nansen's ship.
Baron Dickson says, was probably seen
drifting in the pack ice. and that fact, lie
thinks, gave rise to the conjecture that the
explorer had discovered the pole and was
returning.
ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, Feb. 19.â
The Bussian explorer, Baron Toll, who es
tablished the Nansen provision depots on
the new Siberian islands, said to-dav that
he was convinced that Dr. Nansen was re

pots, and thougnt it probable that he was
lingering on the way in order to recuper

FRENCH MINISTERS
TO FORCE AN ISSUE
Determined to Push the Struggle
With the Senate to a
Conclusion.
STRONG RESISTANCE IS MET.
Moderates in the Chamber Will En
deavor to Pull Down the Gov
ernment's Prop.
NEW YORK, N. Y., Feb. 19.â A special
cable dispatch to the Sun from Paris says:
The past forty-eight hours have sharpened
the lines of the impending political con
flict between the Cabinet and the Senate.
It is now generally believed that the Min
isters have deliberately raised the issue
and intend to force it to a conclusion. It
is even more certain that the Senate will
resist to its last resort the attempt to sub
ordinate its will and authority to those of
the lower house.
The situation is in one sense similar to
that which often exists between the Senate
and House at Washington, or between the
Lords and Commons in England, but it is
unprecedented in France and has a very
different significance under the French
constitution, which makes the Cabinet
responsible to both Houses of the Legis
lature.
The Bourgeois .Cabinet, after making a
statement which virtually gives to a vote
of confidence in the Chamber the signifi
cance it does not legitimately possess, of
censure upon the Senate, has decided to
do nothing further until the Senate shall
take the initiative at its session on Friday.
The Moderates ia the Chamber, however,
are so alarmed by the situation that they
will probably make some effort at to
morrow's session either to outvote the
Government or otnerwise deprive them of
the backing of the lower House in the
fight against the Senate.
The deadlock, at all events, will not last
long, for now, that the radicals have shown
their teeth, they will be fought desperately
both in and out of Parliament. Perhaps
it will be the best thing in the end if the
plans of the plotters be allowed to develop
a little further, in order to expose the
dangers clearly and allow public senti
ment to meet them.
HIRES NON-UNION MEN
One Complaint Against Senator
Stewart's Paper, the Sil
ver Knight.
Carl Browne Supplies the Cartoons,
While the Nevadan Writes
Heavy Editorials.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 19.â The
latest literary combination has been ar
ranged between Senator Stewart of Ne
vada and Carl Browne of California, the
picturesque young artist who played
Sancho Fanza to Coxey's Don Quixote|dur
ing the march of the Commonweal army
upon Washington two years ago, and who
afterward married Coxey's daughter.
Senator Stewart writes the editorials for
the Silver Knight and Browne makes car
toons to illustrate them. The Senator
claims that his paper, which has been
running only a year or so, now has a cir
culation of 65,000 copies, all paid for in
advance, the larger portion at the rate of
$1 a year, the remainder at the rate of fifty
cents in clubs of 100. The editorial otiices
are in Washington, but the mechanical
work is done in Alexandria, for the pur
pose of avoiding the typographical union,
the pressmen's union and other labor
organizations. In Alexandria there is no
typographical union and the Senator may
not only employ non-union men, but may
regulate his own wages. This will furnish
an interesting topic for the next Populist
convention to discuss.
But there is little doubt that the Silver
Knight has a large and growing ex cula
tion, for Editor Stewart has been com
pelled to buy a couple of new and im
proved presses, which are now being set
up in his Alexandria establishment.
Stewart is grand sachem of the Silver
Knights of America and is listing recruits
rapidly. There arc temples in every State,
from Maine to Washington, but they are
most numerous and have the largest mem
bership in the West and South. A Repre
sentative in Congress from Ohio says
there are not 500 voters in his county, Re
publican or Democratic, who do not be
long to the order, while in Kansas, Ne
braska, Colorado ar\d other States further
west there are temples in every village.
WILL NOT BE ABROGATED.
Traffic Contract Between the Pacific Mail
and the Panama Railroad Still in
Effect.
NEW YORK, N. Y., Feb. 19.â 1t n
stated authoritatively that there is no
danger of an abrogation of the traffic con
tract between the Panama Railroad and
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. The
facts as to the failure of the Pacific Mail
Company to deliver business to the
Panama road are that the Central Ameri
can and west coast traihe was so heavy
that there was not room enough on the
Pacific Mail boats for freight via the
Isthmus of Panama, and it was sent by
the Southern Pacific Railroad. Two Pacific
Mail boats, which formerly ran on the
Atlantic, are on the way from New York
to go into service on the Pacific, and thev
will be able to handle the business in
tended for the Panama Railroad.
The contract between the two provides
explicitly that the Pacific Mail shall fur
nish adequate facilities for delivering busi
ness to the Panama road. Accordingly
the Pacific Mail Company will have to pay
an indemnity to the Panama Railroad for
its recent failure to do so. Arbitrators
will determine the amount as stipulated
in the contract.
CAVE Of THE WINDS VISITED.
Extensive Exploration Made Possible by
the Lowitrss of the Xingara.
NIAGARA FALLS, N. Y., F;b. 19.â The
"dry" condition of the falls yesterday was
such that, under the guidance of John
Barlow, the Cave of the Winds guide, a
party of thirty men made an exploration
of the Cave of the Winds in a way never
made before. The cave could be reached
only on the remarkable ice formation, the
bridges of stairways heretofore in use hav
ing been crushed to pieces.
The cave presented a remarkable appear
ance. In tome places the ice formed on
the rocks towered sixty to eighty feet
above the heads of the spectators. Instead
of the immense volume of water ordinarily
coming over there was scarcely more than
a mist.
From this spot, which is within the cir
cle of the Horseshoe Falls, the party
walked on the ice bridge directly before
tne American Falls and within full sweep
of it, and followed almost the line of the
course taken by tho Maid of the Mist
steamer in the navigation season. This is
the first time that the bridge has been
known to extend so far east, and no one
has been known to have traveled over the
route t*ken yesterday.
ANARCHISTS AT WORK.
Four Bombs Exploded in the Royal
Garden at Madrid.
MADRID, Spain, Feb. 19.â A bomb was
exploded at 9 o'clock this morning in the
garden of the royal palace in this city. An
energetic search was at once instituted by
the palace guard, and while this was going
on three more bombs were exploded at
different points in the garden. No one
was injured by the explosions, which are
believed to have been the work of an
anarchist.
DEATH WAS IN THE AIR
A Lawyer's Illustration of an
Assassin's Act Almost
Ends in a Tragedy.
He Wields a Butcher's Cleaver, and
the Blade Is Hurled Into the
Crowd of Spectators.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 19.â At 3 o'clock
to-day a jury found Nic Marzen guilty of
the murder of Fritz Holzhuetter in this
city on January 30, 1895, and condemned
him to death. The murder was for money
which Holzhuetter was known to have for
the purpose of buying cattle.
The closing scene of the trial was in
tense, dramatic and almost tragic. While
making the closing address, Prosecuting
Attorney Pearson picked up the butcher's
cleaver, with which he claimed Marzen
killed Hoizhuetter, and, by way of illus
tration to the jury as to the manner of the
murderous blow, raised the cleaver over
his head with a quick motion, intending
to bring it down heavily. But the glisten
ing blade flew from the handle, went over
the heads of a dozen persons and struck a
pillar in the courtroom, entering the hard
wood to the depth of a half inch. Two
men, one of them Charles Pagle, a wit
ness, sat near the pillar and the keen
edged steel passed between their heads
with scarcely an inch of space on either
side.
This excitement was followed by the
collapse of the prisoner, while Judge
Smith was reading his instructions. He
tried to rise, his arms fell on the table in
front of him and he fell forward on his
face. Wild excitement was caused in the
crowded courtroom, Mrs. Marzen's shrieks
piercing the air. The Judge was com
pelled to adjourn court.

NEW YORK. N. Y.. Feb. 19.â Dispatches

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
FORD APPEARS
FOR THE MINERS.
Gains the Support of the
California Delegation
in Congress.
WILL AID HIS BILLS.
Reduction of the Caminetti Act's
Penalty Clause Is Alone
Opposed.
USE OF RESTRAINING DAMS.
He Declares That the System Has
Proved a Success â An Agree
ment Reached.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 19.-A meet
ing of the California Congressional delega
tion with the visiting delegates from Cali
fornia was held this afternoon. Senator
White presided. The principal object was
to bring about a more amicable under
standing between the representatives of
the mining and of the agricultural dis
tricts.
Tirey L. Ford, on behalf of the miners'
convention, denied the charge that the re
straining dams erected under the Carai
netti act had proved a failure. He admit
ted that an unusually severe winter had
caused ten of those dams to break, but he
said hydrauiic mining was being carried
on behind 104 dams, only four of which
had not withstood the unusual Hoods. He
thought that thi3 was a good snowing for
the bediming of a great and difficult sys
tem of impounding the debris, and that a
little more care on the part of the Debris
Commission in issuing permits would
make the system perfectly s;if<\
Ford stated that he was willing to go as
far as he possibly could to meet the views
of the valley people, but there were two
points upon which he was compelled to
insist. First, the appropriation which he
sought must not be less than $250,000, and
second, it must be made in such a manner
as to unlock the appropriation made by
the California Legislature. With these
two conditions reserved, he was willing to
join forces with the valley delegates and
work in harmony with them. He said,
further, that he was perfectly willing to
support a bill creating a Sacramento River
commission, and would cheerfully do aii
he could for it.
Ford explained the provisions of the bill
introduced by Johnson in the House and
Perkins in tlie Senate, revising the Federal
mining laws. He stated that Senator
Stewart had also introduced a bill in the
Senate for the revision of the Federal
mining laws, but that it differed materi
ally from the Perkins and Johnson bill.
"The point upon which miners most
strongly insist," said Mr. Ford, "is the
provision for the transfer of contests (as
to the mineral or agricultural character of
land), from the land offices to the local
courts in the respective counties where the
land is situated."
He said Senator Stewart had agreed to
permit this provision to be added to his
bill, and that a further conference was to
be had with Senator Stewart with the view
to harmonizing other differences in the
bill.
Ford took occasion to correct an erro
neous impression upon the part of some
of the delegation that hydraulic mining
was or ever had been an unlawful busiÂ«
ness. He quoted from the California Su
preme Court to the effect that the business
was not itself unlawful, and that injunc

The delegation agreed to support the

The Spaniards first attacked Maceo's
fortes, killing rive and wounding three of
the rebels, and then engaged the insurgents
under Gomez, killing six of them and
wounding twenty-seven. The Spanish
cavalry made a brilliant charge, and its
artillery did effective work against the
enemy. The loss of the Government troops
was four killed and one wounded.
Senor Adolfo Porset, Governor of the
Maianzas province, has issued a circular
directing the owners and managers of
sugar estates in his jurisdiction to begin
the work of cane-grinding with the least
possible delay. This circular is the result
of the verbal instructions given Governor
Porset by Captain-General W.eyler at a
recent conference.
The planters are expected to hire guards
for their estates, as the Government troops
are being withdrawn in order to aid in the
carrying on of military operations against
the insurgents. The province of Matanzas
contains several hundred sugar estates, in
cludins; some of the finest on the island.
Governor Porset declares to the planters

CHICAGO. 111., Feb. 19.â At a meeting '
of Lodge 61 of the United Garment
makers of America to-night the cutters
and trimmers of Chicago declared a gen
era! stx-ike, excluding about ten clothiers
only, against whom there is no grievance.
The cutters and trimmers in the city have
been working on a minimum salary of $20 â 
weekly, and now an effort is being made
to have them do piece work, which will in
many cases leduce wages. It is against
this that the men protest.
About 800 men will leave work in the
morning. Tim will affect all the makers
of garments and the families of all con
cerned, and it is estimated that over 25,000
peoY>le will be affected bv the strike. The
cutters assert that they have plenty of
money to sustain a strike and this is an
opportune time for declaring their rijrhts,
as it is nearly the end of a season, and they
would in any event be idle for a short
time.
The cutters are all ordered out at once.
No committees have been appointed to
wait on the manufacturers, but the cutters
themselves wait to be approached fora set
tlement of difficulties.

VULCAN VICTIMS
Four Bodies Are Recovered
From the Sepulchral
Colliery.
LONG LIST OF MISSING.
Fifty-Five Miners Now Known
to Have Been Killed by
the Explosion.
FOUL GAS FILLS THE DRIFT.
Slow Progress Made in Delving for the
Unfortunates â Many Families
Destitute.
NEWCASTLE, Colo., Feb. 19.â The
number of lives lost in the Vulcan mine
explosion, according to the Coroner's list,
is fifty-five. The officers of the company
have- checked up their lamp list, which
shows that iifty-one lamps were issued that
morning to miners, so that it is probable
that rifty-five will about cover the cas
ualties of the exp;osion. Four bodies
were recovered up to 3 o'olock this after
noon, the deadly gas still preventing a
thorough search of the long slope and the
many chambers.
A temporary fan was set up and a vigor
ous effort made to clear the mine of its
deadly fumes, but as all ventilating must
be done through the slope this is a slow
process. Fortunately it was fully proved
this morning that the mine did not become
lircd by the explosion, and after the debris
at the first 300 feet of slope was removed
all further obstructions seem to have been
overcome and nothing but the black damp
now prevents the rescue of the bodies of
theueadmen. However, this is still merely
conjecture. Back of the slope is the main
entry, which runs to a distance of 1400
feet. The effects of the explosion may have
caused great masses of coal to rill the pas
sageways and this obstruction will further
delay the progress of rescue.
Of the four bodies discovered, the first
was that of Ed Welsh, a roperider, who
was caught in the dritt and his body
badly mangled, as he was projected out ot
the slope with such terrific force. The
next body was that of Abel Dore, found at
9:30 o'clock last night. His brother Joe
was found at 12:30 and a French carpen
ter named Frank Cimonsie found at 2:30
A. m. These were found lying along the
slope about 300 feet in and they were
badly mangled, as if they, too, had been
driven outward by the force of the escap
ing gas generated in the explosion. The
remaining bodies are around the bend of
the fclGpe, in the entry which forms the
other side of an inverted U, which is the
shape of the workings, and it is along this
j other arm of the U that the chambers !
' were opened.
Before daylight the fan was in motion
j drawing out the fou! gas and black damp, ]
but though repeated efforts to enter the
slope were made none could get in far
enough to discover any more bodies. At
11:30 to-day work ceased because of the
still evident dani<er of the gas. The fan
j still pumped pure air into the mine, but
! the work of clearing out the damp will be
very slow.
A peculiarity of the Vulcan mine has
been the presence of some substance,
either dust or gas, which strangely affected
the eyes of the miners. After a few days
they had to take a lay off to restore their
eyesight and all had to be treated alter
working a shift in the mine.
The entire town has worted herocially
to assist in recovering the bodies of the
dead and to look after the families of the
men. Nearly all were married and some
had large famlies solely dependent upon
the earnings of those caught in ths death
trap.
Little progress may be hoped for in the
work of rescue to-night.
Laie this afternoon State Coal Mines In
spector Griffith, accompanied by a party
of workmen, ventured into the slope, but
made little headway beyond the place
where the bodies already rescued .had been
found. They discovered that much debris
must be removed before the work of rescue
can be done, and also that the drift and
chambers are rapidly filling with water.
Pumps must be set up at once to combat
this new source of trouble, and furttier
delays will ensue.
Everybody is worn out from the excite
ment and fatigues of the past thirty hours.
DIED OF STARVATION.
Poverty and Pride Combined to Bring a
Son of Lady Corrigan to a
Pitiable Condition.
NEW YORK, N. Y., Feb. 19.â Major
George de Bentley, who for the last ten
years has been a noticeable rieure in
Newark, N. J., died in the city hospital
there Monday. While it was known that
he was in straitened circumstances, his
numerous friends had no idea of his real
struggle with poverty. His pride kept
him from revealing his condition, and he
literally starvea himself to death rat,her
than break through his pride enough to
a?k for assistance or even give a hint to
those who would nave willingly aided him.
From papers among his effects it was
learned that Major de Bentley was the son
of Lady Corrigan and the husband of
Elizabeth de Bentley, the daughter of a
wealthy English family, whose estates in
clud Little Grimsby Hall, Loach, Lincoln
shire. After his marriage he came to this
country. He invested and lost large sums
of money in Texas real estate.
It is not definitely known when he went
to Newark, but he had been there at least
ten years. During the latter part of this
time he did odd jobs. He was taken to
the Newark Hospital January 28. Major
de Bentley's friends have purchased a
plat in Woodland Cemetery, and there the
body wili be buried this afternoon. His
relatives abroad have been notified of his
death. Ho is said to have a son some
where in the West.
XO ME ARSE LARGE EX O UGH.
Vtfficultiet Heart the Burial of a Dime
Museum Jut VToinait.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 19.â Not a hearse
could be found in Chicago ample enough
for the funeral of Nellie Cole, "the fat
woman," who was buried from Gavin's
undertaking establishment on North Clark
street yesterday afternoon.
Nellie Cole weighed over 530 pounds.
For years she exhibited herself as a
"freak" in dime museums, being known
as "The Kentucky Beauty." Her last en
gagernent was with; a South Side show,
where she appeared in a fat woman's bi
cycle race.
Around the coffin yesterday were gath
ered her former friends, many of whom
are "freaks." The snake-charmer touched
elbows with the glass-eater, and thesword
swallower with the bearded woman. They
stood quietly about the casket during the
simple services, and by their tears and
sorrowing faces showed their grief at the
death of one of the most popular of their
number. The Rev. Mr. Can't of the Chi
cago Biblical Institute conducted the ser
vices. Then the casket was carried out by
sixteen pallbearers, who found their bur
den all they could carry.
The casket was the biggest ever made in
Chicago, being 33 inches wide, 27 inches
high and 5 feet 6 inches Jong. As no
hearse could be found large enough it was
taken to the cemetery in a covered under
taking wagon. The interment was at Rose
Hill.

The committee decided to hold the an
nual convention at Milwaukee, August 25
to 27, at which time the political campaign
for the ticket will be officially opened. A
committee was chosen to arrange for dis
tinguished speakers and another commit
tee to obtain reduced railway rates.
i- manciai matters was the principal
business of the committee meeting. New
York led off with a cash subscription of its
share toward the campaign fund, and
when the meeting adjourned the National
organization was placed out of debt, and
enough money was in the treasury to be
gin active operations on a large scale.
The committee congratulated itself on
the receipt of a telegram from the league's
attorneys, Blanchard, Carey & Pheips, of
New York, saying that a Court ol Appeals
of that State had rendered a decision
favorable to the committee in a case in
volving $17,000.

The committee reported that the lowa
plan of leamie organization was being put
into operation in all States. The secre

and flood the country with campaign lit
erature, principally on the tariff i3sue,
without favoring any of the candidates.
A telegram of condolence was sent to
Joseph Manley of Maine, who has just
lost his wife, and a cordial vote of thanks
was extended to General Clarkson of

league recognized fully by the National
Republican Committee. Â«
The headquarters of the league in St.
Louis will be at the Lindell Hote), and
the next meeting of the committee will be
held in that citv on June IH. A general
meeting of the league will be held that
evening in the convention building.
HARDiyG'S SCOTOSCOPE.
Claim* Hint With. It He Can Picture
Hidden Object* iiiroct.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 19.âPro
fessor C. Knox Harding, after experiment
ing with cathode rays, will apply fora
patent on a "scotoscope." He says:
"It will be of interest to experimenters
with X rays to know that it is not neces
sary to have any electric discharge in the
vacuum tube for the same rays are found
in spectrum of magnesium, and, to a great
extent. .at calsium. It is evident that if
the new light can photograph a hidden
object, the tiuoroscope will enable us to
see them direct, and even if we can only
photograph shadows, as at present, it is of
more importance to see them direct.
"I hold that light in a scotoscope can be
reflected an>l refracted and focused by a
lens; that this light so produced is strong
ly actinic and is the only means by which
to reduce a picture to a small size, and
having them fixed by direct vision they
can be studied under the microscope. The
vital difference and value of the discovery
is that we obtain by this means not pic
tures of shadows, but pictures direct from
the objects."

WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. 19.-The
crusaders in tbe cause of temperance re
lorm and of Sunday rest law3 were se
verely criticized in the Senate to-day by
Hi!l of New York in connection with a
sheaf of petitions in printed form, ema
nating from the Womaa's Christian Tem
perance Union, against the sale of beer to
immigrants landing on Ellis Island, in
New York harbor, and to the men sta
tioned on Bedloes Island, and in connec
tion with other petitions for a Sunday rest
law in the District of Columbia.
Hill could not see how a glass of beer
could be of great injury to the temperance
cause or have any serious effect on the
health and lives of the immigrants. He
thought, on the contrary, that it was a
very welcome thing, and referred to the
efforts of the well-meaning but misguided
who flooded Congress with such petitions
as extreme paternalism or extreme Roose
veltism. As to the Sunday rest law for
the District of Columbia, he did not see
wuat interest people in New York could
have in it, unless to regulate the conduct
of their Senators and Representatives.
A resolution for an investigation as to
the issues of bonds in 1894, 1895 and 1896
was offered by Lodge of Massachusetts,
and went over till to-morrow. Notice was
given by Morgan (D.) of Alabama that he
would bring up the Cuban resolution for
consideration at 2 o'clock to-morrow.
The diplomatic and consular appropria
tion bill was passed and the conference re
port on the urgent deficiency bill was
agreed to. The remainder of the day's
session was spent in the passage of private
pension bills and at 5:06 p. m. the Senate
adjourned.
Wolcott (K.) of Colorado, chairman of
the Postofiiee Committee, reported a bill to
prevent the sending through the mails by
any department of the Government of mat
ter weighing more than four pounds, ex
cept written or printed matter. He spoke
of the great abuse of sending through
the mails typewriters ana other machines.
Numerous private pension bills consid
ered and passed were bills increasing
the pension of the widow of Brevet-
Brigadier - General Horace Boughton
to $7f> a month; giving pensions
of $100 a month to the widows of
General O. M. Poe, General Blunt, Gen
eral Gibbon and General Thomas Ewing
and to Generals Nathan Kimball and
Joseph Ã. West; $75 to the widow of Sur
geon-General Sutherland; $25 to Eliza
Saidford, daughter of a Revolutionary
soldier, and of $75 to the widow of General
Morrow.
A bill giving a pension of $75 a month to
the widow of ex-Senator Spencer of Ala
bama, as colonel of an Alabama regiment,
provoked a long discussion, Senators Al
len (Pop.) of Nebraska and Berry (D.) of
Arkansas arguing that distinctions should
not be made in the pensions to officers'
widows (the regular pension law in this
case only allowing $30 a month), nor be
tween the widows of officers and the
widows of soldiers.
The discussion led to a rather angry
altercation between Senators Allen and
Call, who, to the great amusement of the
galleries, denounced each other as
"plutocrats." Finally the bill was re
committed to the Committee on Pensions.
A bill granting a pension of $200
to the widow of the late Secre
tary of State, Waltar Q. Gresham, as
brigadier- general, with an amendment
making it $100, went over without action,
as Voorhees (D.) of Indiana, who had
originally introduced the bill, but who
was absent to-day, desired to oppose the
ameniiment. A bill was also passed for
the payment of a year's salary to the
widow of the late Isaac H. Bassett, the
veteran assistant doorkeeper of the Senate.
IV THE HOUSE.
Settler* on Land Grants Given a Ten
I'ear*' Extension.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 19.â The
house was strictly "on business" to-day,
and in the live hours' session disposed of
two important measures. The first was
the bill under consideration yesterday to
extend for ten years the time in which the
Government may institute suits to annul
land grants illegally or erroneously issued.
Hepburn's amendment to restrict the law
officers to cases of fraud was rejected, as
was also the amendment proposed by the
Committee on Public Lands to reopen
Mexican and Spanish grants. An amend
ment proposed by Loud (R.) of California
was agreed to, restricting the operations
of the law to patents issued under railroad
and wagon-road grants. A substitute was
offered by McÃae (D.) of Arkansas to re
peal all legislation on the subject, and was
vijted downâ l49 to 72â which was a test
vote on the bill.
The army appropriation b ill was passed
without much discussion, but most of the
new legislation proposed by the Committee
on Military Affairs went out on points of
order. Among the propositions thus re
jected was the one to compel the President
to appoint paymasters from the line officers
of the army alone, shutting out civilians.
The unanimous report of the Committee
on Ways and Means against the passage
of the bill to regulate the issue of liquor
licenses was submitted by Evans (R.) of
Kentucky and ordered printed.
The agreement of the conferees on the
urgent deficiency bill was reported and
concurred in.
When the House took up the bill to
extend for ten years from March 3 next
the time within which suits may be
brought to vacate and annul patents il
legally or erroneously issued upon public
lands, the Committee on Public Lands
having recommended that the distinctive
words "railroad, Mexican, Spanish or
other" special grant be inserted, the Cali
fornia representatives objected to the re
opening of the old Mexican and Spanish
grant controversies, and Loud (R.) of
California offered the amendment to sub
stitute "wagon road" for "Mexican, Span
ish or other," as proposed by the com
mittee. Loud's substitute was agreed to.
Then the bill extending for ten years
from March 3 next the time within which
suits may be brought to vacate and annul
patents illegally or erroneously issued
upon public lands was passed, after being
further amended so as to require settlers
on lands affected by the bill who had pur
chased from the grantee for less than the
minimum Government price for public
lands to pay to the Government the differ
ence.
When the House went into committee
of the whole to consider the army appro
priation bill Hull (R.) of lowa explained
that the bill carried $23,275,902, being
$23,290 64 more than appropriated for the
current fiscal year and $817,373 less than
the estimates. Pickler (R.) of South
Dakota unsuccessfully endeavored to
secure an amendment which would pre
vent the practice of detailing army officers
to act as Indian agents. It was rejected
on a point of order. The provision in the
bill reducing the number of hospital
stewards from 112 to 100 was struck out on
a point of order. No further changes
were made.
The committee recommended the pas
sage of the bill and the House agreed to
the recommendation.
Cannon (R.) of Illinois reported the
agreement of conferees upon the urgent
deficiency bill and it was agreed to. As
finally adopted the bill carries a total of
$6,305; 436, an increase of $1,584,033 over the
total as it passed the House.
GOLD FOR TILE TMCASURT.
Searly Tu>o- Thirds of the Bond Sale Pro-
ceeda Already I'.tia In.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 19.â 0f the
1111,000,000 for which the new issue of
$100,000,000 4 per cent bonds sold the treas
ury haÃ received directly and indirectly
nearly two-thirds of the amount. So far
$56,000,000 in gold has been taken up in
the treasurer's cash and $19,000,000 is on
deposit in sub-treasuries and National
bank depositories. As fast as possible this
latter sum of gold will be transferred to
the treasury gold reserve, ana probably by
the end of the week the whole $19,000,000
will be taken up on the treasurer's books.
Messrs. J. P. Morgan & Co. and asso
ciates, under their bid for $100,000,000 of
the bonds, are entitled to receive bonds of
the face value on about $4,700,000 in addi
tion to those which they have already
been notified. This will give Mr. Morgan
about $38,000,000 of the new bond issue.
MXGLEi'S BILTj FAVORED.
It Amends the Act to Prevent Extermina
tion of the Seal.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 10.-The
Committee on Ways and Means to-day or
dered a favorable report on the bill of
Dingley of Maine amending the act to pre
vent the extermination of fur-bearing ani
mals in Alaska. An adverse report was
ordered on the bill of Mr. Denny of
Mississippi, making it unlawful for any
United States commissioner of internal
revenue to grant or issue to any person or
persons or corporation license for the Rale
of whisky or other intoxicants in any
State, county or parish where the law of
such places prohibits the sale of liquor.

to the United States, was formally pre
sented to President Cleveland in the Blue
Room of the White House oy Secretary
Oiney at 11 o'clock this morning. The

Another Chance for Arizona.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 10.â The

to report the Arizona Statehood bill was
defeated by a vote of six to tive. This
leaves the bill without prejudice in the
same position as it occupied before the
vote last Wednesday.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 10.â The
House Committee on Rivers and Harbors
to-day beard Captain Corcoran of Stock
ton, Cal., in support of a proposition to
appropriate $57,000 for the improvement
of the San Joaquin River, so that the cur
rent of the river will keep it clear of sand
and sediment. He also urged an appro
priation of $4000 for the improvement of
the Napa River.
Ex-State Senator Johnston of Sacramento
spoke in favor of the bill creating the Sac
ramento River Commission and urged the
necessity of such a comprehensive scheme
of river improvement, stating that at a
comparatively small expense that great
waterway from San Francisco to a point
thirty-two miles above Red Bluff could be
made navigable for steamers of considera
ble tonnage.
Mr. Cleaves of Shasta County made a
j statement concerning the advantages
! which would result in the improvement of
| the upper Sacramento from Sacramento to

there were immense advantages in this
region undeveloped which water trans
portation would cause to be developed.
Mr. Coulter spoke in favor of masing
an appropriation for the improvement of
' Alviso Slough. The report of the survey
\on this project is unfavorable, and the
chairman of the committee informed him
' that no appropriation for its improvement
'â  could be made.
After discussion on the subject by Sena-
I tors White and Perkins and Representa
! tive Maguire, the committee promised to
| order a new examination and to consider
I the proposition of ordering a resurvey.
Dr. McLean closed the bearing by pre
senting the claims of Oakland harbor. He
discussed the commercial situation, claim
ing that a reasonable appropriation at this
time would immensely improve the har
bor and increase its already growing im
' portance as a port.

Manifestoes.
EL PASO, Tex., Feb. 19.â This hasfceen
a day of watching and waiting, with the re
sult thatevery one knows at sunset as much
as at sunrise, and little, if anything, more.
There was somewhat of a more buoyant
lone in the sporting market than yester
dav and as the afternoon wore on every
body was on the qui vive for tips concern
ing the location of the battleground or
new movements on the part of the State
or the Mexican authorities. All sorts of
stories were afloat concerning the point
wnore the rin^ has been pitched. A good
authority located it across the Arizona
boundary; an equally reliable one said
confidentially that it would be a matter of
an ail-night ride, and a third insisted that
he would be able to reach the spot on a
wheel.
Stuart and his colleagues preserved the
same sphynx-like silence and would not
deign to notice even the telegraphed roor
back from Galveston that the mill would
be brought off on a barge on the Gulf
of Mexico.
In response to a request for an authori- â ,
tative statement concerning Maher's con- j
fiition this candid reply was received from !
Maher's backers at Las Cruces tins even- j
ing:
To the United Prat: Maiier will be in fair

X-RAYS USED ON STEEL
Roentgen's Discovery Will Be
Utilized to Detect Flaws
in the Metal.
Fair Shadows Developed in Experi
mental Photographs of the
Dense Substance.
CHICACO, 111., Feb. 19.â Tne Illinois
Steel Company is making plans to use the
Roentgen photography for the detection
of Haws in steel. If experiments along
this line are successful, one of the greatest
benefits of the new photography will ac
crue to manufacturing and metallurgy.
Albert Sauveur, chemist and engineer oi
the Illinois Steel Company, is conducting
these experiments. If his hypothesis is
correct, the penetrating nature of the rays
and its photographic effects will be the
means of detecting flaws in steel and deter
mining the purity of metals.
Thi9 fact is appreciated by the directors !
of the Illinois Steel Company, and a com
plete and searching investigation will be
; made at once in the laboratory of the com
i pany at the mills in South Chicago.
Owing to the difficulty of getting the I
needed apparatus the experiments have j
been handicapped and delayed. Mr. i
Sauveur expects to get results this week.
He was fortunate in being able to obtain a
Crookes tube from one of the electrical j
, supply houses in Chicago. Besides this, j
he Uad several tubes blown at the Illinois j
Steel Works. He has been disappointed !
in not securing an induction coil that will j
! give the current necessary to produce the
light.
The chemist has been photographing i
various metals and has produced fair
: shadows. But steel is so dense that some i
i have regarded it as doubtful if rays can be
, produced strong enough to pass through
it ana record on the sensitive plate the ,
1 delicate variations in the shadows which i
, indicate flaws.
Ttie experiments do not differ from '<
j the numerous tests of the Roentgen dis- i
covery which are being carried on all over i
; the country. An ordinary sensitive plate I
; in a holder is placed beneath the Crookes !
. tube. The objects to be photographed are j
â  placed upon the plate and the current â 
i sent through the tube to develop the un- <
i known rays, wiiich have a photocraphic ;
effect upon the plate.
It has become a matter of ease now for ;
: any one to produce shadows by metals
varying in depth of tone, according to
' their density. It is only necessary to have
a correct Crookes tube having a practically j
perfect vacuum. But to discover flaws in j
i tnese metals by the shadinp in tne nega
i tive will be much more difficult, especially
when the metal is steel and almost opaque
to these rays, even on lone exposure. The
outcome of the experiments cannot be
foretold.
EFFECT OF TALHERT'S SPEECH.
Several South Carolinans lAkely to Lose
T/irir Seats in Contjreax.
NEW YORK, N. Y., Feb. 19.â A Sun
special from Washington says: A rumor
circulated among the members of the
Houth Carolina delegation yesterday was
to the effect that the recent speech of Jas
per Talbert, which was denounced as
treasonable by Representative Barrett of
Massachusetts, probably would cost sev
eral South Carolina Congressmen their
seats.
Four contested election cases pending
before the House are about to be decided.
On the very day when Representative Tal
bert created the scene in the House, the
Committee on Elections having the Sjuth
Carolina cases in hand were about to re
port.
It was understood generally that at least
three, if not all, of the sitting members
from South Carolina would get. clear tities
to their seats. Then came tne Talbert
episode. Almost instantly there appeared
to be a change of sentiment among certain
members of the committee regarding the
South Carolina cases. Tne reports said to
be ready for promulgation were held back,
and discouraging tints were thrown out
to the interested gentlemen from South
Carolina. All inquiries were met with
the statement that the committee was
having great trouble in reaching a decision
in those cases. It was said also that the
Republican National Committee wae urg
ing the Republicans of the elections com
mittee not to lose sight of the political pos
sibilities involved in' the South Carolina

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1896.
RICH ORE FOUND
IN MILL VALLEY
John F. Tobin Discovers a
Fine Gold and Silver
Ledge.
NEARLY $300 TO THE TON
A Result of Searching the
Hills and Valleys for
Six Months.
LOCATION OF THE BONANZA.
Obstacles Under a Spanish Grant
That May Prevent It
Being Worked.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., Feb. 19.â John
F. Tobin of this place claims to have dis
covered a ledge in Mill Valley that is full
of gold and silver, particularly the latter.
He has made a rough assay of the rock,
and makes the startling announcement
that the sjoid and silver in it will run as
high as ?2!tÃ a ton.
Mr. Tobin refuses to divulge the location
of the Jedge, but he says it is in Mill Val
ley and not over two miles from Eastland
station, at the terminus of the Mill Valley
branch of the North Pacific Coast Railroad.
Mr. Tobin is well known in Mill Valley,
where he is the agent for Wells, Fargo &
Co. He is trustworthy, and his story is
believed by the people here.
He was seen this evening at his home
near Millwood by a Call correspondent,
and said that it was true that he had found
a ledge rich in gold and silver.
"I have been searching the hills and
valleys in and about Mill Valley for the
last six months," said he, "and at last
have succeeded in locating a rich deposit.
"I made a quick assay of a small piece
of rock weighing about half an ounce
yesterday, and was surprised to find that
it contained a. great amount of silver. My
rough estimates placed the value of the
rock at $298 a ton, and as I had no, means
of ascertaining the quantity of gold in the
rock 1 believe its value will run still
higher."
Mr. Tobin said that his stepfather had
years ago discovered gold near Mill Val
ley, but was unable to work it as it was sit
uated on the great Throckmorton ranch,
which was a Spanish grant, and the laws
of California did not allow a prospector to
claim land that was under a Spanish grant.
It was for that reason that the region was
never worked.
Mr. Tobin thinks that he will have the
' same difficulty in working his ledge. He
says that it is situated on the lands of the
, Tamalpais Land and Water Company, and
j he fears that they will have some Lesi
j tancy in selling any property that he
I might wish to purchase.
"I have shown samples of the rock to
some persons having a knowledge of
I mines," said Mr. Tobin, "and they have
: expressed the opinion that it is very rich
! in silver, which substantiates my assay,
i I will send a sample to the City to-morrow
: and hope to have it assayed there, and by
to-morrow night I will know whether there
is any gold in the rock or not.
"I expect there will be a large number
of men searching the hills for the ledge
as soon as the papers publish my discov
ery, but I have no fear of their finding: the
place. It took me many months of weary
tramping before I came across it, and I do
not think they will discover it in a day.
'â¢The ledge is quite large, and the sam
ples of rock I have assayed have been
taken from the surface."

AX VXL.VVKT BURGLAR.
shot in the Arm and Subsequently Cap
tured at I'ortland.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 19.â A notorious
young crook, whose real name the police
have not yet learned, fell into the hands of
the police in a peculiar manner here to
day. At an early hour this morning B. L.
Houston, a Southern Pacific Railroad con
ductor, living in East Portland, was
awakened by a burglar breakine into his
residence through the bathroom window.
Mr. and Mrs. Houston, each armed with a
revolver, made a search for the burglar.
Mr. Houston located the intruder on the
porch with a big bundle of clothes and
valuables he had picked up in a quiet
search over the entire house, and opened
tire on him. The burglar decamped in
i hot haste, yclliug with pain. By drops of
blood scattered on the walk, he was tracked
for several blocks.
About noon Dr. Harry McKay, in the
Marquam building, was called upon by a
stranger who had a bad wound in his arm
he wanted dressed. The stranger said he
had shot himself accidentally while exam
ining a gun. Dr. McKay suspected his
patient of some crooiced work and tele
phoned the poiice about it. Tne stranger
was arrested, and gave his name as Joseph
Harrison, an Englishman. He claimed to
have come here from Seattle. Later tne
man confessed thac he had burglarized
Houston's house.
THE JOHXSOS BO\B.
Still Eluding the Officer*â Their Horses
Are Captured.
VISALIA, Cal., Feb. lU.â This morning
a Call reporter left Visalia very early to
make a tour of investigation of the neigh
borhood where the Johnson boys lived,
near Traver. The neighbors of the boys
talked freely, and it was ascertained that
the twins were very close to the officers
last Sunday. In an interview with Mrs.
Hill, who lives one and a half miles from
the Johnson place, where it was reported
the boys were in hiding while the officers
were at the house, she said :
"Mr. Hafley came along, and my boy,
Eddie, went out to talk to him. Hafley
wanted Eddie to go with him, but the bov
replied that he had not lost the Johnson
boys. Hatley then rode on toward Mon
son. My daughter was at home, and after
Eddie told her what Hafley wanted she
exclaimed: 'Why. Ido wish I could see
the Johnsons. I have heard so much
about them.' "
"Hardly had she finished speaking when
we heard the sound of horses as if m a fast
Jope. On looking out, sure enough, it was
the Johnson boys and my daughter was
granted her wish. At that time Mr. Hattey
was a full mile and a quarter away from
our bouse and I was wishing the boys were
further than that away. I asked them if
they knew that was Hafley and they an
swered yes. They said the officers were
not looking for them. True enough, thev
had got into a little trouble, but that it
didn t amount to much, but still the otli
cers were not looking fortnem very much.
I felt very much relieved when they left."
Last Monday several of the posse "trailed
them to the Hard in crossing on the east
side road. About two hours after the
twins had doubled on their track and were
seen going toward Orosi. This wouid be
Monday afternoon between o and 4 o'clock.
All of the posses have returned. They
captured the Johnsons' horses in a lield
near Farniersville, six miles east of Vi
salia.

PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 19. -Isaac W.
MUI9 brought the news to Prineville on
Monday that he had shot and killed James
R. Wagner. Mills' version of the affair,
the only one heard thus far, is that last
Saturday he rode to a fence beyond which
Wagner was plowing, and asked Wagner
to come out to where he was, as he
wanted to have an understanding in refer
ence to a division of fence over which they
had quarreled and which they Had decided
to divide, each buiiding his own fence.
Wagner replied that if Mills desired to
talk with him he would have to come
where he was, so Mills rode in to where
Wagner was, when he found that Wagner
had tied his team to a post and in his
hands held a double-barreled shotgun.
MiJis got down from his horse and then
commenced a war of words. Pretty hard
names were given and returned, until
finally Wagner, who was standing near
Mills, suddenly raided his shotgun and
struck Mills in the face, making a wound
near the right eye. At the same time,
stepping back a little, he fired at Mills,
who at the same instant struck the gun
with his right hand, receiving the contents
in the back of his right hand, near the
knuckle joints and ranging upward toward
the wrist, tearing away the tendons.
This shot dazed Mills for a moment, but
on recovering he reached for his pistol
with nis left I and and immediately fired,
and at tne same time Wagner shot the
second time, and again Mills received the
contents in the hand, but this time in the
left, the one in which lie had his pistol.
Mills dropped his pistol and Wagner im
mediately fell over backward, and Mills,
after some difficulty, succeeded in picking
up his pistol and walked off, leading his
horse. After going a short distance he
met a. boy, who helped him to his home
and gave the alarm.
Both men were prominent stockmen of
Harain, in the southeastern part of Crook
County, where the shooting took Dlace.
Mills was brought to Prineville and his
wounds treated. He at once sent for
Sheriff Combs ana surrendered himself.
Mills is not absolutely sure that Wagner
was killed, but is of the opinion that he
died almost at once. Mills will lose his
right hand and possibly his left. Both
men have families and are old residents of
the county. Wagner was about 60 years
of age, while Mills is a comparatively
young man.
BIGHTS OF WAY IN FRESNO
The San Joaquin Valley Railway
Company Making Good
Progress.
Many Obstacles Encountered, but They
Will Eventually Be Over
come.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 19.â The right-of
way committee of the San Joaquin Valley
Railroad Company is making commend
able progress in securing rights of way
through the county. Several knotty prob
lems have been disposed of, and the way
now seems open for the committee to com
plete its labors at no distant day.
Among the purchases just consummatad
are four Jots at the corner of Mono and Q
streets, the property of Mrs. Lizzie
Manuel, who resides in Los Angeles.
A basis of settlement has been agreed
upon between the committee and W. B.
Baker of San Jose, who owns ihe south
west quarter of section 21, township 13,
range 20. The agreement calls for seven
acres running diagonally through the
property, which adjoins the Montpelier
Tract. The dosing of this deal was the
source of much annoyance to the commit
tee. After considerable correspondence
with the owner of the property it was
agreed to submit the matter to arbitration.
A committee composed of Alex Gordon.
J. P. Strother and J. M. Braly was chosen,
and the value of the land involved to
gether with the damages was fixed at $400.
An agreement between the company
and Jules Gottleib of Denver has been
reached. Four lota on (I street are in
volved in this deal.
The committee is encountering no small
decree of difficulty in securing deeds to
some of the property not yet purchased.
However, the committee is making ex
cellent progress, everything considered,
and will no doubt be prepared for the con
struction crews when once they cross the
line into Fresno County.

FORTY PERSONS
AS DEFENDANTS.
Suit to Foreclose a Ken
wood Land Company
Mortgage.
COLONISTS IN BAD LUCK.
Some of Them Will Probably
Lose Their Homes and
Little Farms.
NO TITLE TO THE PROPERTY.
How the Beautiful Los Guillicos
Valley Was Settled by De
luded People.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. 19.â Forty
persons are named as defendants in a suit
to foreclose a mortgage given by the Ken
wood Land Company to Giacondo Gianella
;n 18OL, and some of the forty are liable to
lose their homes as the result.
The property involved is in the beauti
ful and fertile Los Guillicos Valley, and
was formerly known as theGianella ranch.
Tne traot was purchased by D. M. Carman
and one or two associates under the cor
poration name of the "Kenwood Land
Company.''
A comparatively small payment was
made at the time of the purchase and
mortgages given for about $<J5,000, the bal
ance due on the purchase price.
I>. M. Carman, who is an energetic pro
moter and a pleasing and persuasive
talker, was sent by the Kenwood Land
Company to Chicago, where it seems he
had no trouble in inducing colonists to
buy small tracts of the land. A small
payment down was all that was required,
the balance due to be paid on long time
and in easy installments.
Many of the intending settlers bought
without seeing the property and had no
conception of the difficulties to be over
come in getting their vineyards and
orchards into profitable bearing. Some
arrived at the land of the "Olive and the
Fig, "where nature's table is ever set, with
out the means of subsistence during the
time that must elapse between the plant
-1112 and the harvest.
Many returned to their homes in
Illinois and a few removed to Santa
Rosa.
Those who were able tb keep up their
payments and remain to tend their trees
and vines until they should become profit
able stayed on their little farms and
beautified their new homes. As the
company was unable to give title to the
land a receipt for the money paid and a
bond for a deed was all the colonists could
show for their time, trouble and money.
The money received by the company was
used in improving the tract and paying
up the outstanding notes given in Gia
nella, of which there were three.
As long as new colonists could be in
duced to purchase and settle upon the
tract things went swimmingly, and the in
terest and first notes becoming due were
promptly paid.
But for the past year or more payments
of interest and principal were few and far
between, and the Gianellas were at length
compelled to take steps to secure them
selves, and the result will likely prove
disastrous to the colonists. This will work
a hardship on some of our foremost
citizens, and will be o! great injury to one
of the fairest and most productive valleys
in the State.
ALTMURIAXS TO DISBAXD.
Short of Money and Disappointed in
Various Expectations.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. 10.â The
members of the Altrurian colony, near
Mark West Springs, in this county, have
decided to disband. In the resolutions
adopted by them they Bay that they were
disappointed in thetr financial expecta
tions ana that their resources were not
sufficient to carry out the plans of the
colony.
The location of the colony was ill chosen
and the land comparatively unproductive,
and the final breaking up of the project
has been freely predicted for some time.
It is claimed that some of the leaders of
the society were visionary and impracti
cable, bringing financial distress to their
followers. The association will 'be main
tained, however, for such other work as it
finds feasible under its articles of incor
poration.
TTORKIXG FOR GOOD ROADS.
Members of the State Commission to Sleet
Fresno's Supervisors.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 19.â R. C. Irvine of
Sacramento and J. L. Maude of Riverside,
members of the State Board of Good
Roads Commission, were in Fresno to-day.
Tney are making a preliminary tour of
the State collecting data as to the condition
of pnblic highways, with the view of
matting a report to Governor Budd.
This report will form the basis of much
needed legislation on the subject of im
proved roads in California, fo say these
Commissioners. An inspection "of the
roads in this and Madera counties wili
complete their tour.
They have found the highways in most
of the counties in deplorable condition in
comparison with leading Eastern States.
It is the opinion of the Commissioners
that iarge sums of money are being con
stantly squandered under the present plan
of improvement.
They will therefore recommend some
very radical changes from the present
plans, in behalf of more economical and
beneficial methods of public-roads ex
penditures.
Next Friday these Commissioners will
meet the Board of Supervisors of this
county and prominent taxpayers at the
courthouse here for a conference on the
subjeot.

SANTA CLARA'S STUDENTS.
They Give a Brilliant Entertainment in
Honor of Washington's
Birthday,
â  SANTA CLARA. Cal., Feb. 19.â The in
troductory address delivered by James F.
Emery that welcomed the large audience
at Exhibition Hall last evening inaugu
rated the attractive programme of the en
tertainment given in honor of Washing
ton's birthday by the Santa Clara College
students.
The oration was succeeded by the recita
tion of John A. Selby, and at interval?
during the evening the college brass band
rendered a series of appropriate instru
mental selections, pleasingly varied by the
performances of the string orchestra,
under the leadership of Professor F. Schu
bert.
The feature of the occasion was the pre
sentation of the Shakespearean dranm of
"Richard III," the cast of characters being
entirely composed of the students of the
institution. Those who sustained the
leading characters in the play acquit
ted themselves of their different
roles in a manner highly creditable
to the young amateurs, while the able
support of others who delineated the less
prominent parts materially assisted in the
success that characterized the production
throughout all its details.
The accessories of scenery and costumes,
historically exact, brought out the stir
ring incidents of the play in excellent
prominence, and the general effect re
flected great credit on those under whose
management the play was so attractively
placed upon the stage.
SANTA BARBARA NEWS
Dissatisfaction Over the Effort to
Push the Claim of San Pedro
Harbor.
The City's Splendid Natural Resources
Ignored to Benefit More Favored
Rivals.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Feb. 19.â
Santa Barbarans are feeling sore over the
effort to rush the claim of San Pedro
harbor against that of Santa Barbara at
the very time when it looks as -though
this place liad fair prospect of receiving
the aid she had long deserved from Con
gress.
The earliest voyagers to thig coast agreed
that the three most important harbors in
the State and the safest refuge in stormy
weather were the bays of San Francisco,
San Diego and the Santa Barbara harbor.
Before the discovery of gold Santa Bar
bara was a very important trading port,
and in those days there existed no ques
tion but that the State should become set
tled and its resources be developed, and
Santa Barbara would rank as a port of the
first importance.
In a communication to a local paper to
day Dr. Shaw, one of our oldest and most
intelligent citizens, relates the history of
Santa Barbara's lost appropriation of
$100,000, voted by Congress in ISC6, which
was afterward revoked pending a survey
asked by members of the Peralta family,
who conceived tho absurd idea of estab
lishing the port in the vicinity of Point
Sal, and thereby benefiting their own
property.
The survey was made, but never ap
proved, and the appropriation never re
pealed by Congress.
Recently a concerted effort has been
made by public-spirited citizens, headed
by the Board of Trade, to have Santa Bar
bara declared merely a port of entry, with
some modest hope that if this recognition
of her advantages were made some small
appropriation might be secured for the
purpose of improving vÂ»harf facilities.
Senators Perkins and White have both
expressed themselves as favorable to tne
project, but the strong effort now made to
secure further appropriations for San
Pedro will probably result in setting aside
for another term of years the superior
claims of this port, which sixty years ago
was reckoned as a supero harbor, and San
Pedro was only sought when the necessi
ties of commerce demanded that vessels
should put in there.
Santa Barbara has a hard experience.
For nearly half a century her splendid
natural advantages have been ignored and
she has been forced io witness less favored
rivals outstripping her in all directions by
sheer force of superior numbers and politi
cal influence.
HARMEN HELD TO ANSWER.
The Prosecution Submits the Case With
out Argumentâ Bail Fixed
at $3000.
SACRAMENTO, Cat.., Feb. 19.â There
was little of material interest in the Har
mon examination to-day.
Brady was recalled and subjected to se
vere cross-examination by ex-Senator
Sprague in regard to what inducements
had been offered him by agents of Wells,
Fargo & Co. to induce him to make a con
fession.
Sheriff Johnson took the stand and tes
tified as to his connection in the arrest of
Harmen and recovery of certain portions
of the stolen money he had found.
The prosecution submitted the case with
out argument, and defendant's counsel
made a short address to the effect that his
client was not a criminal and that no jury
would by its verdict so brand him.
If what they say is true, this man simply
went out in the brush and found some
money hidden there, which he did not
give up until it was demanded.
Concluding, Attorney Sprague said that
Detective Thacker, as shown by the evi
dence, had conspired with Bandit Brady,
the man who was implicated in the mur
der of brave Sheriff Bogard, and that he
had promised the bandit immunity from
prosecution for his crime of train-robbery.
At the conclusion of his argument Judge
Henry held Harmen to answer to the Su
perior Court, fixing the bail at $3000.
FIERCE MOVXTAIX FIRE.
Anxiety for the Safety of a Sp anish
American Family.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Feb. 19.â A
fierce mountain fire is raging in San Roqui
Canyon, close to the city. There is no
wind, but the flames have covered consid
erable territory, entirely burning out Gar
cia Canyon, a" branch of the San Koqui,
and running far up the mountain side.
Many visitors have taken horse and car
riage and cone out to the elevated ground
overlooking the place to better enjoy the
brilliant spectacle.
Some anxiety is entertained concerning
the safety of a young Spanish American
rancher, Aledoni Garcia, who, with his
wife and two little children, are residing
in a cabin up the canyon, the place being
a veritable hretrap should the flames have
broken out below them without warning.

ARIZONA HOLDS
HIGH CARNIVAL
Banners of Orange, White
and Crimson Wave at
Phoenix.
THE MIDWINTER FIESTA
Many Visitors From Southern
California Participate in
the Jollification.
THE EXERCISES AND PARADE.
Music Floats, Indians and Regular
Troops Add Brilliancy to
the Event.
PHCENIX, Ariz., Feb. 19. -Under the
streaming banners of orange, white and
crimson, waving so gladly at the bidding
of each vagrant zephyr in the sunbeam
laden air, all Arizona entertained many
visitors and held high carnival in this city
to-day, the occasion being the second an
nual midwinter fiesta.
For many weeks arrangements have
been in progress. The citizens one and nil
have taken an absorbing interest in it, and
to-day was the culmination of all these
combined and unified efforts.
The exercises of the day opened with a
concert by the Eleventh Regiment band,
rendered under the green trees in the
courthouse plaza. Then came the formal
opening, H. C. Gooding, ex-Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court, delivering the ad
dress of welcome.
At 3 r. m. occurred the grand parade.
This was really fine, a distinguishing and
notable feature being the presence of a
delegation of 150 of the most prominent
business men in Los Angeles. They
brought with them the famous Bruin float.
This was borne in the parade by four
Pima Indians.
Miss Lena Purdy, one of the most popu
lar and beautiful young ladies of Phoenix,
received the most votes and hence was
chasen in the procession as the Carnival
Queen.
The Indians from the Pima, Sacaton
and White Mountain reservations were a
feature.
There was also a very large delegation
from the Indian school near this city. It
was a sight incongruous enough â the
Apache, his sworn enemy the Pima, and
the Papago marching side by side in front
of their children, who as pupils of lhe
school mad up a brass band whose music
was not at all bad.
There were about forty-five floats, two
regiments of the United States regulars
and others, making in all about 2500 peo
ple, occupying about one hour in passing
a given point.
As a whole the occasion passed off
siroothly, and on all sides to-night
Director-General Francis C. Hatch and
Major Ed Schwartz, marshal of the day,
are receiving high encomiums of praise.
The season occupies the remainder of this
week.
The Los Angeles delegation, headed by
Mr. Montgomery and John J. Converse of
that city, serenaded Governor Hughes,
Chief Justice Baker and Whitelaw Reid
last night. Mr. Converse acted as spokes
man for the crowd at each place.
Governor Hughes made a neat reply, in
which he said the interests of Arizona and
Southern California were identical, and
that in a case of emergency the latter
would be called upon to help Arizona in
any measure had before Congress. Much
applause greeted this statement.
Chief Justice Baker also replied to an in
vitation issued by Mr. Francis. He
thanked the gentlemen and excused his
own uselessness by the fact that sickness
prevented his replying fittingly.
Whitelaw Reid also responded. He
spoke of the unity of interests of Southern
California and Oregon and recommended
the cultivation of closer commercial rela
tionship.
The party was accompanied by the
steam caliope quartet, the most renowned
musical organization in Arizona. Among
those present were Messrs. Francis of the
Herald, Converse of the Express, Mont
gomery, Smith and Newton.
JUST TO SCARE THE SOT,
Why a Stockton Man Took a Shot at a
Mischievous Urchin.
STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. 19.-Jiiumie
Newbury, a 14-year-old boy, was shot last
evening near the pavilion by a man on a
streetcar, who resented the boy's act iri
throwing flour on him as the car passed.
The conductor saw the man fire the shot,
but did not think it had any serious end
ing and did not report the matter to the
police. The boy received a severe flesh
wound and is in danger of blood-poisoning.
To-day Harry Masters, a groceryman]
surrendered himself to the police and said
that he fired the shot merely to frighten
the boy. He was charged with assault with
a deadly weapon and was placed under
bonds pending the result of the boy's inju
ries.
Masters' friends profess great surprise
at his foolhardy act and are doing all they
can to assist him in his trouble, but are
severe in their criticism of his conduct.
A STOCKTOX HOT'S fTIXDFALZ.
Recover* $'Â£800 Itamagea for Having
Been Put in Irons.
STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. 19. - Charles
Trabing, a 16-year-old boy, to-day ob
tained judgment against the California
Navigation and Improvement Company
for $2000 damages.
Trabing is the boy who was put in irons
by Captain Benson on March 31 of last
year for alleged non-payment or fare. At
the next landing place he was put ashore,
and, according to his story, had to walk
thirty miles to a friend's.
The company professes to believe that
Captain Beuson acted within the limits of
the law and that the boy gave offense by
abusive language to the passengers and
did not pay his fare.
The company's attorneys will move for
a new trial, and in case of failure will ap
peal the case to the Supreme Court.
PORT TOWA'SJSAn WILL CASE.
Two Women. Claim the Estate of the Late
I/arht Spoor.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. 19.-
There ia a contest in prospect here over
property valued at $15,000, left by ex-Coun
cilman David Spoor, a pioneer, who died
on February 11. His will, dated February
5, 1895, in which all his property is left to
his sister, Mrs. M. J. Cluni of St. Paul,
Minn., was filed yesterday, and to-day it
i is claimed by his wife that the deceased
signed a later will leaving all the property
to herself. It is said the last will was made
in San Francisco, where Spoor went to con
sult a specialist, who told him four weeks
ago that he could not live more than a
month, and if a later will does not turn up
the one on file will be contested.
WAR IN A CITY COUNCIL
The Mayor ot Port Town send Has a Coun-
oilman Ejected From His
Seat
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. 19.â A
complaint was issued this evening charg
ing Mayor Rogers and Chief of Police
Stamer with assault and battery on the
person of Councilman Jacobs, who was, at
last night's meeting of the City Council,
forcibly ejected from his seat in the Conn
cil by the Chief of Police on the order of
the Mayor.
There has been trouble between the
Mayor and Council for the past six months
over city appointments. The majority of
the Council has steadily refused to con
firm the Mayor's appointees by a vote of
four to three, but last night the Mayor at
tempted to remove Councilman Jacobs,
one of the majority against him, who has
recently moved out of the ward from
which he was elected.
On the advice of the City Attorney,
Jacobs refused to vacate, and was removed
as stated. The result will be the arrest of
the Mayor and Chief of Police as soon as
papers are signed by Jacobs.
The real light is over the City Treasurer's
office.
The present Treasurer deposits city
money in a bank of which Collector Saun
ders is president, and Mayor Rogers, al
though a Democrat, is at the head of the
anti-Saunders Democratic faction, and at
least a dozen leading politicians of both
parties are involved in this trouble. As a
result of this light the Democratic party
of this county is now hopelessly rent
asunder.
TWO SUICIDES AT ST. HELENA.
One Shoots Himself and the Other Takes
Carbolic Acid.
ST. HELENA, Cal., Feb. 19.â One sui
cide is enough to startle this usually quiet
town, but it had two this afternoon.
About 2 o'clock an Italian named Gal
natti was brought from Beringer's ranch
with his face all shot to pieces.
Fellow-workmen heard two shots ten min
utes apart. Upon investigation they found
Galnatti lying in a pool of blood, but
alive. He said he was tired of life and
wanted to die, so he took a shotgun loaded
witn sniall shot and rired into his face.
Finding that tt did not kill him he fired
the other barrel, which also failed to kill
him. The doctor says the man may live,
but he will be blind and have little face
left.
The first suicide had hardly been cared
for before a report came that'John Nielsen
had killed himself. His little girl, return
ing home from school, went to the wood
shed for wood to get supper and found her
father sitting in a chair dead.
He had taken carbolic acid and had
been dead two or three hours when found.
Deceased was a well-knotvn hotel man of
this city and leaves a wife and three chil
dren. Despondency and family troubles
are supposed to have been the cause. He
had been out of business several weeks
and recently had trouble with his wife.
THE WILLOWS TRAGEDY.
Frank Putman and John Crothers
on the Witness Stand for
the Prosecution.
The Court Takes a Recess and Puts
the Jury in the Hands of
the Sheriff.
"WILLOWS, Cal., Feb. 19.â Frank Put
nam, the witness who left the stand last
night, was recalled this morning and
: testified that Mrs. Sehorn, wife of the de
; fendant, came upon the scene and remon
; strated with the defendant, who told her
to let him alone and gave her a push away.
The next witness was John Crotncrs, a
young man who was employed in the store
of the deceased at the time and was pres
ent at the killing of Putnam. He testified:
"I came from supper, and saw Sehorn
and Putnam talking; saw Mrs. Sehorn
and her little ?on near by, and one Frank
McNorton also. Putnam was standing in
front of the store, leaning acainst the awn
ing-pole. Sehorn was shaking his finger
! in his face, anil called him 'a liar' twice.
"Hulet came between them and then
Putnam struck defendant in the face with
his fist, staggering him against Hulet, but
not knocking him down. Then Sehorn
shot Putnam four times. Sehorn shot
Putnam when his back was to him. I
went into the back part of the store, and
the next I saw they brought Putnam into
the store and laid him on the floor."
Attorney Albery worried the boy wit
ness until 4 o'clock, when Attorney Swin-
I ford elicited as follows:
"At the time I was examined before the
Justice it was my first experience as a wit
ness and 1 was excited. lam not excited
now and have thought the matter care
fuliy over since that time."
J. 1?. William?, who was a Constable at
the time of the homicide, was the next
witness. He testified:
"Between (j and 7 o'clock in front of
Putnam's drugstore on the evening of Oc
tober 7 my attention was attracted to the
parties in front of the drugstore, but
didn't know them until I was six or eight
feet of them.
"I heard some talk and saw three or
four men together and thought somethine
was going to happen. I Lurried there
aud had got within six or eight feet when
a shot was tired, before I had got closer
than ten or twelve feet of them I saw that
Sehorn was In a bent position and was
straightening up. 1 saw Sehorn h're the
shot. Ido not know how Sehorn got into
the bent position.
"Frank Putman had hold of the deceased
and was trying to get him away, pushing
or pulling him to get him off the sidewalk.
Did not see Putman make an attempt to
strike Sehorn. Putman kept backing off
and fell in the street."
The court took a recess and put the jury
into the hands of the Sheriff until 9
o'clock to-morrow morning.
Closing a tiap in the Coast Road.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Feb. 19.â
Beginning with Sunday, the 22d of
February, the Southern Pacific will com
mence to run through trains from here to
Elwood, connectine with stages running
to Casmalia, and thus closing the gap in
the coast road.
This news is hailed with delight, for
while it is not probable that Santa Bar
bara will find an appreciable gain in time
as regards transportation between here and
San Francisco, the movement seems to
indicate a serious purpose on the part of
the railroad company to complete build
ing the road at an early date so that the
stage line will be shortened by constantly
advancing railroad stations.

Frank Black for Mayor. The A. P. A.

nominations, and while failing as regards
the mayoralty, it named a number of"can

OFFICER ON TRIAL
AT SACRAMENTO
Serious Charges Preferred
Against Police Cap
tain Green.
SCENE IN THE JURY-ROOM
The President of the Board of
City Trustees Accused of
Prejudice.
A STORM OF ANGRY PROTESTS.
The Accused Seen to Enter Faro
Games and Drink Whisky While
on Duty.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 19.â The
trial of Captain Anthony Green before
the Board of City Trustees to-nijjht drew
an immense crowd. The charges, which
have heretofore been published in full in
The Call, were preferred by Mayor C. H.
Hubbard.
Chief M. M. Drew was sworn and stated
the duties of the captain. Under cross
examination he stated that as far as he
knew no charges had ever been filed with
him against Captain Green and Green had
attended to his duty. He had no method
of ascertaining positively whether Green
attended to his duties or not, as Green's
duties always commenced after his ended.
At this point Captain Green filed a re
monstrance against the President of the
Board of Trustees acting as a member of
the jury, on the grounds that he had time
and time again expressed a decided preju
dice against him, and had repeatedly ap
proached members of this board and re
quested them to join him in having him
discharged. He did not consider that the
president was capable.
This aroused a storm of angry protest
from several members of the board, who
not only repudiated these charges, but
claimed that the president of the board
was no't on trial.
The chairman of the police committee
then rose and stated that the president
was not concerned in the matter, and Cap
tain Green acknowledged that his informa
tion onihe subject was largely hearsay.
W. L. Leonard, an agent who had been
engaged by the police committee of the
board of trustees to investigate into the
method in which the members of the po
lice force have been performing their
duties, was the next witness. He stated
that he had followed the accused for the
past three weeks. He had repeatedly seen
him enter various places where faro and
otner games were conducted.
He had entered these places, but had
not played at the games to his knowledge.
He had seen him enter a saloon and tako
a drink of whisky when on duty. He had
seen him enter the residence 1013 Q street
at five minutes after 12, and, although he
had watched two hours, he had not come
out.
Mayor Hubbard stated positively that
Captain Green had acknowledged to him
that he was at the residence 1013 Q street
at 12 o'clock at night, but that he went
there to pluck the wing-feathers of the
gamecocks, who were flying over the
fence, and then Captain Green established
an apparently clear alibi by numerous
witnesses wno positively swore that at the
time he was accused of being in the afore
said residence he was attending to his
duties.
Every other allegation was disproved by
Green's witnesses and the matter was ad
journed until Saturday night, when it is
rumored considerable rebuttal testimony
of a startling nature may be introduced.
YOLO AND COLUSA CANAL.
Scheme to Place a Large Area of
Very Rich Land Under
Cultivation.
A Meeting to Be Held at Knights
Landing to Consider the
Question.
WOODLAND, Cal., Feb. 19.â An impor
tant and highly interesting meeting to
land-owners in Reclamation District 103
will be held at Knights Landing in this
county Saturday, February 29.
The purpose of the meeting is to devise
some system of drainage by which a large
body of the best farming land in Yolo and
Colusa counties can be reclaimed.
The land is already protected from the
overflow water of the river, but there are
several creeks that run down from the
hills and empty into the basin from which
there is at present no outlet into the river.
It is the disposition of this hill water
that furnishes the vexing problem to the
farmers, as there is not a drop of the
river water in all the basin. All schemes
to reclaim the Jand from the devastation
of the hill water have so far proved un
availing.
This body of land comprises about 74 ,000
acres of very productive soil. The latest
scheme is to construct what will be called
the West Side Canal. It is proposed to
begin at a point north of Colusa and run
southeasterly along the border of the basin
and along the north side of the ridge at
Knights Landing.
It is said that such a canal can be con
structed so that the water can be emptied
into the Sacramento River above high
water mark, and without in the least en
dangering the town of Knights Landing,
or increasing the danger of flooding the
farming districts below the town.
Tn e cost of the canal is estimated at
$/00,000, and the money is easily obtain
able.
SMUGGZEIt I>T4 HOyrtH HELV.
lUch Gem* Taken in Charge by a United
States' Detective.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Feb. 19.-The
United States authorities believe smuggled
diamonds have been disposed of in this
city, ana that they came through a Cin
cinnati house, one of the largest importers
of gems in the country. About a week
ago a captain of a steamship on the Red
Star line arrested at Philadelphia, and
a box containing valuable gems was found
in his possession. The package was ad
dressed to the Cincinnati firm. and did not
appear on the steamer's manifest.
Yesterday Charles Rogers went to an
express ' office ?' and called for a package.
He paid the charges and was about to
walk out when a man stepped up and said ; i
"I will take charge of those diamonds."
The stranger threw back his coat, display
ing the badge of a United States officer.
The diamonds are being held at the
express office until the officials are able to
identify them as smuggled gems. Ttity
are said to be worth $33,000.
TRAMPS IX A. HOLD-UP.
Vagrants Traveling in a Boxcar forced
to Gire Vp Their Savings,
NEW YORK, N. Y., Feb. 10.â A Morris
town (N. J.), special says: Something new
in the line of a hold-up took place about a
mile from Dover, on the Delaware, Lacka
wanna and Western Railway, at an early
hour yesterday morning. A freight train
had come in from Scran ton, Pa., and about
iiftecn men, some of them tramps, and
others who had been at work and saving
their money and I: beating" their way home
were in a boxcar.
As the train stopped there was a rap fir
admission, and those inside supposing
some one wanted shelter, opened the door.
Outside were three masked men armed
with revolvers and dark lanterns.
Two of the men entered the car and com
manded the occupants to throw up their
hands. They then ordered them to stand
line, and while one of them held the gun
his companion went through the crowd.
The robbers secured about $200 and three
gold watches.
WHAT SUNNYSIDE WANTS
Extension of Its Avenue Desired
Through Mr. Sutro's
Property.
Ashbury Heights Property-Owners to
Discuss the Question of
Franchises.
The Sunnyside Improvement Club, when
it meets in Vice-President Eugene Dasse's
hall on Circular avenue Friday night
proposes to take up vigorously the ques
tion of having Sunnyside avenue ex
tended through Mayor Sutro's property,
so as to connect with the Ocean boulevard.
"Three years ago," said E. Avery Mc-
Carthy, "Mr. Sutro promised us that he
would have Sunnyside avenue so extended,
but he has not yet done anything toward
it. Our people have had Sunnyside ave
nue opened and put in shape fora distance
of about one mile, at a cost of $75,000,
making a fine roadway 100 feet in width.
We are getting tired of waiting for the ex
tension."
Another question to come up is the con
dition of the Southern Pacific Company's
property on Circular avenue. The em
bankment there needs attention, it is said,
and the fences are senerally dilapidated.
The organization of south of the park
property-owners known as the "South
Side " Club is preparing to celebrate the
completion of the Ocean boulevard as soon
as Contractor Buckman finishes his job.
The time for the completion of the con
tract is April 1. President Charles W.
Pope has already consulted with Editor
Hayman, who owns the Ocean House,
with a view to a big banquet. The boule
vard has been macadamized to within
three blocks of the Ocean House.
Mr. Pope said yesterday it was the in
tention of the Market-street Railway Com
pany to change the H-street steam-dummy
line into an electric line and run it out
Forty-eighth avenue to the Ocean House.
The company owns about 2000 feet front
age now on the bouievardâ three blocks
adjoining the Ocean House property â
which, according to Mr. Pope, the com
pany proposes to convert into a resort.
The Ashbury Heights and Stanyan
street Improvement Club is considerably
agitated over the franchise recently ap
plied for by Secretary W'iJlrutt on behalf
of the Market-street Railway Company.
As usual, a condition of the franchise, in
tended to bar out every other bidder, re
quires that the pieces of road applied for
must be "an extension of and adjunct to
and in connection with the street railroads
now owned by tne Market-street Railwav
Company."
President George A. Rankin could not
say yesterday afternoon just what action
would be taken in the matter. A meeting
of the club is to be held at F. W. M.
Lango's house, 127 Carl street, on the first
Monday of the month. Mr. Rankin's
opinion of the Market-street Railway
Company's move was that it constituted
an indication that it anticipated losing the
suit brought by the club to compel a for
feiture of the old Metropolitan franchise
and that it was preparing to quietly aban
don the old franchise.
Tbe franchise applied for proposes to
cover several pieces of road as 'follows:
Along Page street, from Masonic avenue
to Stanyan street; along Mason street,
from Market to Eddv, and along the block
on Hyde street from Ellis to O'Farrell,
and thence out O'Farrell to Scott.
There was no doubt in Mr. Rankin's
mind that the Board of Supervisors would
grant the franchise, but from Mr. Rankin's
point of view this franchise would not
legally be worth the paper written upon,
and in the same category Mr. Rankin
placed sweepingly all the franchises now
owned by the street railway system.

â¢â¢â¢â¢
of people at 8000. Before the first race
was started the grand stand was literally
packed, and the management fearing the
transportation facilities would be inade
quate to handle the big mass, ordered a
special train. It was "ladies' day" as well
as the closing day of the two-weeks' meet
ing and the fair sex predominated.
The day's sport was not marred by a
single unpleasant feature. Six events
were down on the card, of which the fa
vorites captured three.
The great three-cornered contest be
tween Basso, Oakland and Cadmus at two
miles for a $2000 stake was the event of the
day and awakened genuine enthusiasm.
Contrary to the outside public's expecta
tions, who thought Oakland had the best
chance. Basso opened a 4 to . r > favorite,
which price was speedily cut to 3 to 5.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1896.
Cadmus, who opened at twos, went back '
to 3 to 1, with Oakland closing third in
demand at 4>^. The result was a hollow
victory for the favorite. The pace at the
opening was slow, Bergen on Cadmus j
rating along in front. The brown horse ;
sporting the Spreckels red, white and blue, j
made the running for the three for over a |
mile and a half, where the other two
closed up, and tna trio swung into the j
stretch for the last time on nearly equul I
terms, Basso being slightly in front, appar- |
ently cantering.
Cadmus soon cried quits and the favor
ite bpgan drawing away from Oakland.
H. Martin on the latterurged his mount
with whip and steel, but he was entirely
outclassed, tiie favorite beating him out a
length almost pulled to a walk. Cadmus
finished aoout six lengths further away.
The time for the distance was 3:34}^, the
California record standing at 3:30.
The Burns & Waterhouse stable cut an
other watermelon in tiie two-year-old j
event with Colonel Wheeler at sixes in the i
betting. The youngster assumed a com
manding lead in the stretch and won gal
loping in 49Vi seconds for the four fur- I
longs. Scarborough and Lady Laurel- j
wood, who vied In the betting for second- !
choice honors, foueht it out for the place, !
which was captured by the former. The J
3 to 1 favorite Torpedo ran poorly.
The unlucky Walter J was backed down
from 2' 2 ' to Bto sto win the second event,
a six-furlong dash with eleven starters, but
was slow in breaking away when the bar
rier to the starting machine was hoisted
â nd ran unplaced. The second choice,
Hermanita, won handily bv a couple of
lengths, with the 30 to 1 aho't Artist in the
place.
The handicap-hurdle event, one and a
quarter miles over five jumps, resulted in
a big upset. Burmah went to the post
with first call in the betting backed from |
twos down to 3 to 2, and after heading |
Cicero in the stretch looked to have the
race won, but in the final few yards was
beaten out a short neck by the 20 to 1 shot i
Argenta, ridden by George Cochran. Con
tentment, the second choice, ran unplaced.
Pittsburg Phil's horse Ed Kearney had
performed so inconsistently in his races
that the general public fought shy of him j
in the seven-furlong run that was fifth on j
the-card, and even money or 9 to 10 was J
always obtainable about him. A hc-avv j
play was made on Tom Griffin's Vassar, |
who was backed from 4to 2}-, to 1. The I
noted plunger's horse had one of his run- :
ning streaks on, for taking the lead almost |
as the Hag fell, was always in front, win
ning with little to spare by a neck from j
Thelma. Nephew was a bang-up third. |
Vassar was cut off soon after the tiag fell, I
or he would undoubtedly have won.
The fast brown filly Aiobalosca from the
Corrigan stable was hammered down from
6t05t03 to sin the betting on the last
race, a six-furlong spin, ami she won as
she liked from Pat Murphy, after making
all the running. Unity was third.
Track and Paddock Items.
The Bay District track reopens to-day
with a good card. The Australian start
ing machine has been placed at most of
the starting posts.
Jockey Cairns was indefinitely sus
pended by the stewards for his ride on
Tom Clarke.
Morven was left at the post in the last
race.
Edward Corrigan will leave for Chicago
this evening. He will remain in the
Windy City only a few days and will then
pay a visit to his breeding farm at Lexing
ton, Ky. Mr. Corrijjan expects to return
to California in a couple of weeks.
The Pacific Coast Jockey Club closed a
contract yesterday with P. de B. Lopez,
and at the coming Ingleside meeting a
starting machine will be seen at all of the
starting posts. One will also be erected
on the inner track for schooling horses in
quiet breaking.
The string of Al Orth arrived at the Bay
District track yesterday from New Orleans.
By actual count "5674 ladies passed
through the gate at Ingleside yesterday.
The trotting-horse men again met at the
rooms of the Breeder and Sportsman, on
Bush street, and adopted various resolu
tions for the advancement of the harness
horse the coming season.
READY TO FIGHT.
Tod Sloan Back* an Unknown Against
Dal Hawkins, tho Well-Known
Local Prize-l'ighter.
Dal Hawkins and Billy McGoidrich are
to meet in the next three or four weeks
and fight for a purse of $1000. The fight
has been under discussion for some time.
It was not till last night that the arrange
ments were completed. The articles have
not been signed, but a forfeit of $100 was
put up last night by each of the two men.
Tod Sloan, the jockey, is backing Mc-
Goidrich. J-fe says nis man is a game
fighter, with a great capacity for punish
ment and a right that is a "terror. Sloan
is to give McGoidrich the $500 Hawkins
puts up if lie wins. His interest in the
right centers on a side bet of $5000 he has
laid on the result of the contest.
McGoidrich is from Los Angeles. He is
known among local pugilists as Mickey
Dooley. He has done no righting here,
but has quite a reputation farther south.
Hawkins is quite a celebrity in San Fran
cisco. He has been in many battles, and
is known as a game if somewhat vicious
tighter.
The time and place for the fight have
not been fixed upon. This is deemed ben
because it is feared that there might be
some police interference. The fight wil[
occupy six, eight or ten rounds. It
promises to be a splendid exposition of
the manly art.

HAVE BROKEN FAITH
Bad Feeling Engendered Between
the Two Rival Racing
Associations.
The Pacific Coast Tockey Club Claims
the Old Club Is Not Living Up
to an Agreement.
The Pacific Coast Jockey Club claims
that the California Jockey Club has broken
faith with tne new racing association, and
that to-day every crime-breedina; gambling
den in the City known by the name of
"commission-houses." as well as those re
sorts in the interior towns of the State, that
are kept alive by the dollars cf petty
employes, opium fiends, messenger boys,
criminals and women of uncertain char
acter, who find an outlet for their
surplus cash by gambling on races, will
be in receipt of the odds, jockeys and
results of the races run at the Bay .District
track.
Edward Corngan, one of the directors of
Ineiesiae tracu, was seen at his hotel last
evening, and stated that by appointment,
he had a meeting with M. A. Gunst and
Henry Ach, two of the moving spirits in
the affairs of the California Jockey Club,
previous to the opening of the meeting
just closed at Ingleside, and that it was
agreed by these two gentlemen that what
ever action was taken by tne management
of the new track in preventing the pool
rooms from obtaining information would
be followed by the California Jockey Club
during its meeting that opens to-day.
Durine tne meeting at Ingleside the
management cut off the interior rooms
who had previously had wires upon learn
ing that the results thus obtained were
being wived back to the City poolrooms.
Balked in this move the proprietors of the
rooms then had the odds, results, etc.,
wired back from Eastern cities where pool
rooms were in operation. The Ingieside
people then cut off from communication
with the track every poolroom in the
United States, and every precaution was
used to i>revent information in regard to
the races from being smuggled from tne
track.
The result was tnat the poolrooms were
in a very bad state, bordering on utter
collapse. " Incorrect odds were given,
wrong jockeys were posted on their boards,
no scratches were obtained, and their busi
was was very light Of course, by this ac
tion a heavy loss was entailed upon the
new jockey club, but they were earnest in
their endeavor to rid the turf ol these para
sites pnd raise it to the hieh standard it
has attained in the far East.
The directors of the California Jockey
Club at a meeting held yesterday after
noen, decided to shut off the other city
and interior rooms from getting wires,
hut the eastern cities will be supplied with
bettint: and odds. This of course means
that the City rooms will be open in
full blast ag;un. It remains to be seen
whether the California Jockey Club will
put forth the same strenuous efforts to
close these illegal "joints" as did the new
association.
SPORTS OF ALL KINDS
What the Advisory Committee
Accomplished at the Olym
pic Club.
Where the Lovers of Outdoor Sports
Can Enjoy Themselves on
Saturday.
The advisory committee of the Pacific
Amateur Athietic Association met last
evening at the Olympic Club and raised
the suspension that has been hanging over
some of the amateurs for several weeks.
The boxers and wrestlers are not yet free
from possible punishment and their cases
will be heard at the next meeting of the
committee.
A large gathering of club members who
are interested in handball will be held on
Tuesday evening next, when it is thought
an annex will be formed. The plans for
the proposed new annex are very elaborace,
and as the directors are strongly in favor
of the construction of a magnificently
equipped ball alley an enthusiastic gather
ing of lovers of this grand indoor pastime
is expected at the meeting.
Superintendent Kennedy has ordered
two dozen balls from old Ireland, which is
the home of tuis now very popular
pastime. James C. Nealon, the ex-As
sessor, who is at present on a snipe-shoot
ing expedition near Sacramento, has of
fered $100 to the Olympic Club as an in
ducement to further the growing interest
in the pa me.
John Butler and Dr. von Hoffman have
returned from Duncans Mills, and report â 
that steelhead fishing in Ru3sian River is j
tolerably pood now. Mr. Butler says that
the Supervisors of Sonoma County have j
been severely criticized by residents along
Russian River because of their recent ac
tion in repealing the ordinance which pro- 'â 
hibited the catching of steelheads at the
mouth of the river by means of set-nets.
The State law, however, reads that this
style of fishing is unlawful and, conse
quently, the Fish Commissioners propose
to continue the crusade against a class of
men who persist in catching the so called
salmon.
Deputy Fish Commissioners have been
patroling the Paper-mill, Lagunitas and
Sonoma creeks for the past week, but up
to the present there have be en no arrests
for illegal fishing reported.
Henry J. J. Plaeke, who styles himself
champion long-distance swimmer ot the
world, is domiciled at the Cosmopolitan
Hotel, and states his willingness to meet
any man in a swimming match. He has
recently arrived in this City from Aus
tralia.
On Saturday a grand potpourri of sport
will be presented. A regatta wilJ be held
on Lake Merntt, in which aJI of the row
ing clubs of any note will be represented
by well-trained crews, the particulars of
winch appeared in last Saturday's Call;
the Interstate Coursing Club will bold a
grand meeting at Newark Park; the wheel
men will concentrate at San Leandro to
see the finish of the 125-mile roadrace; the
Lincoln Gun Club will meet at Alameda
Point, where a blue-rock tournament will
be held, the finish of which will be de
cided on Sunday; a football game is slated
for Central Park. There will also be seve
ral interesting handball games in the
courts on Howard street, and the marks
men who take a delight in pumping lead
at targets will be well represented at the
Shell Mound and San Rafael ranges. The
number of sporting events announced for
Saturday proves beyond question that con
siderable interest is taken in sporting
affairs by the people of tnis City.
TO RESOLVE AND FEAST
The State Conference of Iro-
quois Clubs Will Set the
Pace for the Party.
Braves Will Hold on Saturday the
First State Democratic Gather-
ing of the Year.
The first State Democratic gathering of
the campaign will be the State conference
of Iroquois clubs, which will convene at
Iroquois headquarters in Pythian Castle
next Saturday morning at 11 o'clock.
As the Iroquois organization here and
elsewhere is largely composed of strong
and leading Democrats, it is a thing of
party influence and a party power that is
respected. The coming conference will
serve pretty well as an indication of Demo
cratic sentiment throughout the State on
various things. The conference will be
devoted partly to electing officers and
mainly to the good of the party. Demo
cratic sentiment as gathered there will be
crystallized in a lot of resolutions, which
will probably include in their subjects
the funding bill, the Monroe doctrine,
silver, the administration's indorsement,
Governor Budd's indorsement, the pop
ular election of Senators and various
otiier things about which it will be proper
for representative Democrats from all over
the State to dtclare themselves. The reso
lutions adopted will likely be a foundation
for the State platform, as they have been
on forme: ana similar occasions.
It is likely, too, that the pulling and
hauling for the place for the assembly of
the Democratic State Convention will be
gin at the meeting. The Stockton Demo
crats have already begun putting in their
bids and a number of Stocktonians will do
something in this line for the "Cliicago of
the West" next Saturday. Sacramento
and Santa Cruz areabo spu'ien of as prob
able aspirants for the convention and
these three towns are the only ones
spoken about so far.
Raleigh Barker of Vacaville is the grand
sachem of the State organization and Law
rence .1. Welch of t:iis City is the secretary.
No noticeable campaign for officers has
been opened.
There are about thirty Iroquois clubs
located in leading towns and cities of the
State, north and south, as a result of the
organizing efforts of Max Popper in recent
years. Each club is entitled to repre
sentation at the conference on the basis
of one delegate to each twenty members.
A hundred or so delegates are "expected to
assemble.
The delegates will be guests of the local
Iroquois L'lub at a royai banquet which
will be enjoyed in the evening at Del
nionico's restaurant. Set toasts will be
responded to by John P. Irish, 0. M. Wel
burn, J. C. Ruddick, Kaleigh Barker and
James V. Coleruan, and others will en
deavor to say entertaining thinps. The
board of trustees of the local club have
charge of all arrangements.
1 1 . 1 1 1 â¢1 1 > : 1â  ! Matches.
At F. Ryan's San Francisco ball court yester
day a very interesting game of iiandball was
played between the following four well-known
players: I'. Donnelly, the amateur champion,
ana T. K. Bonnett against J. C. Nealon and M.
J. Killgallon. the Denver champion. They
played the best 3 out of 5 21 aces. Each side
won two games, and the final game was won
by J. C. Nealon and M. J. Kiligalion after a
hnrd strucule by the following score: Nealon
and KillKalion, 7â21â21â17â21; Donnelly
and Bonnett, 21â1(1â10â21â10.

Our carnival ball was not big, but it was
Roasted pelican is not good diet, but

It begins to look a>- if the monopoly cen
tipede would soon be without a siugle leg
to stand on.
Once more the French republic is said to
be in danger of failing, and ouce more it
doesn't even totter.
It is now said it was not the cathode ray
but what scientists call the X ray that
made the ten strike.
The next thing we know Huntington
won't remember that he owes the Govern
ment anything at all.
What Huntington doesn't know about
railroading fills all the bjoks of the
Southern Pacific Company.
Senator Morgan's cross-examination is
getting, in its work (. n Huntingtou with
all the effect of a cathode ray.
The Junta may be right in thinking
P.ainey is 'away oft," but he has a long
reach and may capture them yet.
It is worth Doting that every State in
the Union that has a large gold mining in
dustry is in favor ot free silver coinage.
Whenever the Huntington burr is
opened up we rind the two old chestnuts,
"1 doni know"' and "I don't remember."
It will be a long time yet before the
fistic carnival pets its quietus, for Jim
Corbett has begun to take a tongue in it.
The Senate made a good record for itself
in passing tne pension bill in eight min
utes, but it doesn't promise to keep up the
lick. '
In her rapid acquirement of all the
features of civilization Japan has just de
v eloped a railroad combination and a
Cabinet crisis.
The report from Berlin that the Kaiser
is worse in society than he is in politics
may be put down among the tales that
fatigue creduiity.
The boulevard movement is good, but it
mustn't get too far ahead of the move
ment for the improvement of streets where
business travels.
About the time Huntington gets off the
stand the bond deal investigating commit
tee will put Carlisle on it and then there
will be more fun.
"With the cold shoulder on one side and
bastea ribs on the other monopoly doesn't
know yet whether it lias struck a cold
snap or a hot time.
The goldbug papers may be right in
calling Tillman the "Senate stable-boy,"
but all the same he does his work well in
currying down the donkeys.
It was perhaps well enough for both
houses of Congress to turn their lire on
Secretary Morton, but why hunt a rabbit
when there is a bear in sight?
Although Senator Morgan has been
forced to play a lone hand in the Pacific
Roads Committee, he holds the winning
cards and can euchre the crowd.
It would be a good idea to give the
Balfe-Moore concert a series of encores to
raise money to erect a memorial to Balfe
and Moore as an ornament to the park.
Senator Hill objects to the investigation
of the Cleveland bond deal and it seems
these New York fellows have found out
that it is time for them to stand together.
The carnival in New Orleans may be
larger than any single one of ours, but we
will have enough to surround it with such
a ring of rose festivals as would lose it in
the whirl.
Huntington persists in asserting that
the Ciiff House is a saloon and a gambling
den, but fortunately the fame of that
beautiful resort is too well known for the
lie to obscure, it.
Now that the Cleveland Chamber of
Commerce has rejected Carnegie because
"he is an oppressor of the poor," they
should not allow their philanthropy to
stop there. The poor are still with them.
In the great international game for the
Korean stakes Russia holds the King, but
it remains to be seen whether he belongs
to the trump suit. There is a chance yet
for Japan to turn up a card of another
color.
In publishing interviews of prominent
Californians favorable to the funding bill,
Huntington not only counts his chickens
before they are hatched, but what is more
no sooner are they hatched than they rise
up and deny the allegation.
Ex-Senator Ingalls has appealed to the
Republicans of every county in Kansas to
give instructions on the senatorship to
their representatives in the Legislature,
and if his scheme works he won't be a
statesman out of a job much longer.
The report of the State Liquor Commis
sioner of South Carolina states that from
February 1 to December 31, 1805, the total
sales amounted to $1,076,963, from which
counties and towns derived a net profit of
$106,131 and the State $133,467. It will be
seen therefore that whatever the system
may be-, in other respects it has proven a
fairly profitable one as a matter of busi
ness. f '. " ' "
THE TACTICS OF POOLS.
In the whole course of the contest against
the funding bill no feature of the contro
versy has been more surprising than the
part played by the literary bureau of the
railroad, if in other departments of the
monopoly camp there have been cunning
and skill, in the literary work there has
been nothing but awkwardness and blun
ders. The men appointed to obtain inter
views with prominent Californians favor
able to the funding scheme have gone
about their work with the recklessness of
a journalistic faker who believes that any
thing will do for the day so long as it tills
space and is published a long way from
home.
Column after column of the "Washington
Pott has been ii! Jed with what purports to
be interviews with men of more or less
prominence in California, and these inter
views invariably are made to represent
some form of sentiment favorable to the
funding scheme. A wide variety of ex
pression is given to the different state
ments, but all are so fashioned as to tend
to the same end. In some the funding
scheme is directly commended. Others
oppose the policy of Government opera
tion of the roads, and the false inference
is put forth that such men support the
funding scheme. Still others are made to
denounce the great majority of their fel
low-citizens as "sand-lotters" and "wild
eyed anarchists" because as is alleged they
are opposed to doing justice to capital.
In the concoction of these reported inter
views there is a seen;ing cunning, but the
blundering awkwardness of them is dis
played by the vigor with which they are
denied by the men who are reported to
have given them. Man after man has
arisen to repudiate in language more or
less emphatic the statements attributed to
him. Some of them assert they were
never interviewed at all. Others found
their words garbled or distorted, and in
not a few instances the reported interviews
contained statements the direct opposite
of what the persons interviewed had said.
We have here therefore coming forth
from the literary bureau of the monopoly
a daily iteration of statements conta ining
every form of misrepresentation, from a
sly innuendo to a downright falsehood.
Such methods of conducting a controversy
are so dangerous to the employer of them
it is difficult to understand how men of
even ordinary sagacity, much less honor,
could be tempted to use them under any
circumstances. Their employment by the
railroad therefore is one of the encouraging
signs of victory for the people. The monop
oly must be in a corner, indeed, when it
resorts to such weapons, or perhaps It is
only another illustration of the old truth.
'â¢ Whom the gods would destroy they lirst
make mad.' :
THE TSTJTH ESCAPING.
Mr. Huntington is having an experience
entirelv new to him â he is being cross-ex
amined by men in Congress who have
neitner fear of his power nor respect for
his money and character. Under the ex
asperating pertinacity and contempt of
Senator Morgan he is driven occasionally
into outbursts of anger that alternate with
his abortive attempts at facetiousness, and
under the torture of a cold and merciless
band of iron that holds him to the issue he
is giving forth some truths that all his
powers of evasion are not able to withhold.
He has divulged the fact, for instance,
that it wa3 he Â»vho suggested the destruc
tion of the Contract and Finance Com
pany's books. His assigned reason was
that the concerns of the company had
been closed and that the books were no
longer of any use. Yet he admits that the
books of the Western Development Com
pany were not destroyed, so far as he
knows. The significance of this is appar
ent when it is reflected that the crooked
work which it would be useful at this
juncture to discover was done by the Con
tract and Finance Company. Moreover,
it is not the custom among business men
to destroy the books of enterprises that
have expired unless there is something in
the recoids that would be dangerous to
have discovered. It is commonly believed
in California tnat the books of the Contract
and Finance Company were not destroyed
until Mrs. Colton filed her famous suit for
an accounting, and that the destruction
was intended solely to prevent their con
tents from being made public.
Mr. Huntington has been compelled to
disgorge other useful information. He
testified that the Southern Pacific Com
pany paid the Central Pacific $1,360,000 a
year as rental until the earnings of the
Central fell below that fignre, and then
made a new contract to pay only what the
Central Pacific earned. A close inquiry
would possibly develop the fact that the
new contract was made after the passage
of the Thurman act requiring the crea
tion of a sinking fund. It might not be
difficult to show, further, that about this
time and for the further purpose of im
poverishing the sinking fund the sys
tematic plan of diverting traffic from the
Central to the Southern line was begun.
On top of all that is the consideration
that tne question of foreclosure was gradu
ally approaching, and that a destruction
of the value of the Central Pacific would
make foreclosure and a full recovery of the
Government debt a more difficult process
than if the Central Pacific had been kept
up to its full earning capacity. Mr. Hunt
ington indeed is unwittingly and unwill
ingly giving some very useful information.
IMPROVING THE RIVERS.
While the committee appointed to advo
cate before Coneress various appropria
tions for the improvement of the rivers
and harbors of California is presenting its
case to the Senate and House committees
having in charge the bills governing such
appropriations it is well to turn to an
eminently practical contribution which
has been made to the Woodland Democrat
by J. R. Price, Chief Engineer of the Cali
fornia Commission of Public Works. For
the basis of his argument Mr. Price takes
the majority report of the Mississippi
River Commission, dated February I*7,
ISBO, which report went to the value of
levees and other means for restraining the
flow of inland streams as a safeguard
against inundation of contiguous territory
and the occurrence of shallows and bars to
obstruct navigation.
Mr. Price's argument is reducible to a
simple formula: The restriction of streams
to definite channels may be accomplished
by the construction of devices required by
the circumstances, as levees, wing dams,
jetties and the like; such restriction not
only prevents the overflow of contiguous
low regions but by confining the now re
duces the flood level by bottom-scouring,
prevents the deposition of suspended
solid matter and increases the facilities for
navigation. All these principles are fa
miliar to intelligent persons and need not
be stated, either in Mr. Price's terms or
those of James B. Eads, that brilliant
genius who not only was a member of the
Mississippi River Commission, but who
was the author of the jetties which in
creased the depth of the Mississippi chan
nel from nine feet to thirty-one, and thus
made New Orleans a port of the Gulf of
Mexico.
Mr. Price makes a suggestion of great
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1896.
value. It is that the whole subject of
river improvement in California should be
in the hands of the Federal Government,
and that under its direction there should
be conducted a series of improvements, the
expense of which should be borne in rea
sonable proportion among the Federal
Government, the State government and
the owners of the riparian property
affected;
As the present inadequate carrying
cauacity of our rivera has been ascribed
wholly to the filling process of hydraulic
mining, it may be proper to call attention
to other current and increasing factors
contributing to that end.
Wherever the soil of watersheds is ex
posed or stirred there is bound to ensue a
flow of silt down the draining streams.
The only rivers which are never roiled are
those which issue with an oasy flow from
dense forest regions. Such is the case with
the wonderfully hmpid and sluggish rivers
of Florida. When there comes about a
barbarous burning of the undergrowth "to
preserve the forests," or a clearing and
cultivation of the ground for agricultural
use, or hydraulic mining, or anything else
that gives the erosive power of rains an
opportunity to work, there will be a wash
ing down of the soil into the rivers and a
consequent falling up of the beds of slug
eish streams, with all the ensuing evils.
Hence the spread of agriculture presents
ultimately as grave a menace to our rivers
as does the mining industry which our
agriculturists are fighting sostrenuously.
These are matters to be ponderea in all
fairness and wisdom, and the more they
are considered the wiser will appear Mr.
Price's suggestion that the Federal Gov
ernment should be the center of all move
ments to improve our rivers.
MOORE AND BALPE.
The popular interest shown in the en
tertainment of the Balfe-Moore club was
sufficient to afford reason for the members
to venture upon further efforts and to in
spire them with an ambition for greater
undertakings. It would be well, there
fore, for the club in the flush of this suc
cess to consider whether it could provide
for doing honor to Irish genius and adorn
ing the City at the same time by erecting
a memorial to Moore and Baife In the
Park.
As in the making of San Francisco there
have been employed the energies of all the
best races of earth, so it is fitting that her
great ornamental garden and public pleas
ure ground should be marked with memo
rials of those great men who have been at
once the glory of their own race and an in
spiration and a joy to the whole civilized
world. The souls of genius and of worth
to whom has been given the power to cre
ate and make known to men immortal
ideals of beauty and truth deserve com
mendation everywhere, and particularly
so in San Francisco, where men of all na
tions have been united by destiny in the
common task of building up a city that
ought to reflect the iinest genius of all.
Tom Moore and Michael Balfe have
made the poetry and the music of Ireland
a precious heritage unto all who delight
in those things which are both noble and
beautiful. In the Irish melodies of Moore
there is music in every line, and in the
strains of Balfe's "Bohemian Girl" there
is poetry in every chord. Thousands of
hearts in this City respond to their music
and their poetry as ardently as they are
responded to in Ireland itseif. All these
would willingly unite with the club in
erecting in the park a memorial to serve
as a companion to that erected to Goethe
and Schiller. The undertaking certainly
deserves the best efforts the club can
make, and there can be little doubt that
if made, success will be achieved aiid we
shall have the memorial.
PICTITIOUS MEKIT.
That sort of journalistic "enterprise"
which seeks to better its financial condi
tion by resort to lotteries, coupons and
similar devices is evidently distasteful to
the Argonaut, which, in its last issue, pub
lishes the following:
"The San Jose Mercury copies a recent
editorial in the Argonaut entitled 'Peter
Funk Journalism. 1 and says: 'The Argo
naut speaks with truth and force, but had
it desired to be perfectly fair and candid,
it would not have traveled nearly two
thousand miles from home to select an ex
ample of honest, straightforward journal-
ism, when so conspicuous an example
flourishes beneath its very nose as The
Call.'
"The Argonaut has already frequently
commented approvingly on the course of
The Call in this regard, as that journal
will doubtless admit. We repeat it, how
everâit is the only daily journal in San
Francisco which is apparently able to
stand alone, and does not depend on lot
tery fakes and premium snaps to keep it
going. The article to which the Mercury
refers was necessarily restricted to Chi-
cago, as it discussed the return of journals
to journalism, and Chicago is the only city
where that practice has as yet become gen
eral. In San Francisco, as we said, there
is but one daily journal which is not
edited on the Peter Funk plan and which
is not engaged in junk journalism."

DR. JORDAN TALKS ABOUT NANSEN
President Jordan of the Stanford University
talked with a Call reporter yesterdÃy concern
ing the Arctic explorer, Dr. Nansen. Dr. Jor
dan said:
"Dr. Fridtjof Xansen is a man of tremendous
physical strength and endurance, voung, am
bitious aud withal a highly educated gentle
man, thoroughly trained in the methods of
scientific work.
"When I first knew Xansen, in 188G, he had
but lately taken his degree in science at the
University of Christianta and was then director
of the Natural History Museum of the city of
Bergen. He was a brilliant your.g fellow, with
the solidity ot mind common among Norwe
gians. He stood over six feet in height, well
proportioned, tremendously fcirong, delighting
DR. NANSEN AND HIS PARTY.
in physical exercise. He had on a summer
vacation to the far Xorth killed and mounted
fifteen Polar bears, which he sent to the differ^
ent museums of the world. He had published
several papers on the anatomy of the hagfish
and on the anatomy and morphology of cer
tain groups of worms.
"In 1887 it was my fortune to be able to offer
him a professorship in zoology in the Univer
sity of Indiana, which position he came very
near accepting. But he gave it up to accept
the offer of the Norwegian Government of
means to carry out his scheme of walking
across the glacial plateau ot Greenland. He
wrote me that his friends in C'hristiania all re
garded him as foolish to give u;> the certainties
of a professorship for a scheme such as he was
going into. But his admirable good sense and
his wise choice of men, combined with his un
tiring physical strength, made this dreary ex
pedition a success, adding considerable infor
mation, largely negative, to our knowledge of
the glacial plateaus of the far north.
"Since then he come to feel that the north
pole must be known, and he, if any one, has
the strength and the ability to rind it.
"Not long ago I had the pleasure of naming
for Nansen a new genus of Arctic fishes, the
species being Xansenia groenlandica."
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
"One of the most delightful recollections I
have among all the events of a rather busy
career is that of a week spent in Honolulu some
four or five years ago," said Kalie Putnam at
the Columbia Theater last night. "We had
been to Australia for a season of twenty-six
weeks and were on our journey home. We
stopped at Honolulu, and at the solicitation of
the King, who was then alive, we gave a series
of performances under royal patronage. The
whole community received us with open arms,
and the kindnesses shown us were such as one
never can forget.
"But, aside from that, the beauty of the isl
ands, the strange, almost weird customs of the
natives, the ease and langour which seemed to
permeate and envelop all life made the week
seem like a quickly passing visit to another ex
istence. Puch profusion of flowers and plants,
such perfume-ladened atmosphere, such rare
and pleasing hospitality made one think he
had fallen heir to a quarter-section in an
earthly paradise.
"Major IMacfarlnne. who, I am told, is at
present in San Francisco, was unremitting in
his attentions and his purpose to make our
visit one to be forever remembered. Our per
formances secmod to delight everybody, and
though anxious to set foot again on our own
ground, we all felt a keen regret when the
time came to leave. It is the dream of my life
to go again to those islands of a thousand de
lights."

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
TREATMENT OF SAILORS.
A Plan Suggested for Improving the Lot of
American Seamen.
To the Editor of the Han Francisco Callâ Sir:
One can scarcely take up a newspaper pub
lished in a maritime city that does not contain
an account of 111 usage by ships' officers of
sailors, and that chiefly on American mer
chant ships, and the question arises, Why is it
so? The writer having followed sea life for
many years of his early manhood, feels to
some extent able to answer the question,
trusting that the publication of this commu
nication in so widely circulated a journal as
The Call may be the means of causing a re
form in such matters and benefit those whose
lives are spent on the briny deep.
Tne main cause of ill treatment on board
American vessels is the system of shipping
crews through the means of boarding-house
keepers and their runners, whose words
are taken as to the capabilities of the
men they Introduce to ships' oflicers. A sailing
vessel carries a crew according to the amount
of her tonnage, and among the number re
quires so many able seamen in each watch, the
remainder of the crew being made up of what
is termed ordinary stame:i. When the ship
gets to sea, however, and the officers find half
the men to be land-lubber?', it is no wonder
that trouble occurs, and especially so as that
class of men are, sis a rule, insubordinate and
what is termed "cheeky."
Every ship master aiid officer in these days
of fast passages on clipper ships is anxious to
make good voyages, and nothing is more ag
gravating than for a mate to find when too
late to remedy the difficulty that one-half of
his watcn do not know a bowline from a
wagon wheel or the main brace from a mule's
halter. Hence the knock-down and stringiug
up-to-the-slirouds business.
In the British mercantile service seldom
does anything of this kind take place, and the
reason is obvious, for the following arrange
ment: When a crew signs articles with a
British ship for a foreign voyage each man
who siups as an able seaman procures a'cer
tiricate from the Board of Trade of his compe
tence, which he deposits with the ship's
officers, and if found incompetent may be
landed at any port and can claim no wages;
and those who ship as ordinary seamen have
to do likewise; and seldom is punishment or
hard usage reported in consequence of such
arraugement, for an officer knows he can de
pend ou the men that comprise his watch in
any emergency.
Chief and second mates have to undergo ex
aminations before the Board of Trade as to
their etlk-iency in navigation and seamanship,
and cannot ship on a foreign-bound vessel
without producing a certificate of competency.
It would be well if the same rule were ear
ned out at every American seaport, and if a
law were enacted to severely punish every ras
cally person found guilty of loistiug dock
loafers and other vagabonds on shifts oflicers
as able seamen a seaman's life would be much
improved. Old-Timer.

THE POINT OF VIEW.
This worid is hs we make it,
I often hear them say.
li wcare sad and tearful,
The world will seem that way;
And if we seek the dark side.
Where everything Roes wrong.
And see molehills as mountains,
Our lives will seem 100 long.
But if we geek life's sunshine,
Sweet joy to other's give.
And sayly climb life's mountains,
As though we're elad to live;
To overcame disaster,
And round us sunshine shower-
To make our dear friends happy-
Then joy will be our dower.
The world is but a mirror.
UefiectiuK each one's mind.
If we look at it crossly
To us 'twill not look'kind;
But if we siii. le upon it,
It will bÂ«? joyous, too â
No matter bow we see it,
'Twill give us our own view.
â¢ So, when the world seems dreary,
And life seems bitter, too,
Jusr ask your disposition
If It can oetter
And, if it turns to sunshine, .
. The world will look so bright
Thut you will be forgetting
How (lurk has been the nl^ht.

LADY'S WAIST WITH BOX-PLEATED
BLOUSE FRONT.
Here is a charming model for exira waists
of silk, batiste or other cotton, as well as lor
entire costumes of silk, wool or cotton.
The pattern has a fitted lining, the material
being seamless both back and front. The box
pleat is cut separate and sewn on, which is less
troublesome for the maker than to have it cut
in one piece with the front.
a handsome crepon gown of old green was
made with a waist after this pattern, and a
perfectly plain tkirt. The trimming consisted
of embroidered bands of creamy batiste laid
over black satin ribbons. Wide black satin
ribbon made the stock collar with a bow at the
back. A bow like that shown iu the illustra
tion was set on either side of the box-pleat at
the waist.
A serge dress of black had the shoulder
straps of bright rose-colore/l ribbon, overlaid
with white embroidery. The box-pleats were
of white lawn, with a rutlle of narrow Valen
ciennes lace on the edge of each fold. The
sleeves on this gown reached to the waist ex
actly like the pattern, which is longer than
shown in the illustration.
A printed organdy made after this model was
trimmed with brettelles of ribbon, with a bow
on the shoulder. Over the stock collar, which
was of the same violet ribbon, were tiny points
of white nainsook, edged with lace," six of
these points just meeting extended all around
the coliar, being sewed in at the top and over
lapping the collar, points downward.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.-
Payne Ciarke has come very near losing his
life since his arrival in San Francisco. When
he opened here in "Aida" with the Tavary
company tho tenor was suffering from a slight
lameness caused by the friction of a new shoe.
He paid no attention to the scratch, however,
and continued to go about as usual, till blood
poisoning from the wound set in. Even then
the tenor refused to consider himself on the
sick-list, and it was not till he was very ill that
he gave up his work and sent for a doctor.
The physician, who found him delirious,
arrived just in time to avert an attack of
lockjaw, and for some days Payne Clarke
hovered between life and death. He is on the
highway to recovery now, and it is hoped will
soon be able to resume his work in those roles
where he especially shines. Great commisera
tion is felt for him among his many friends,
particularly as his illness occurred when he
was suffering considerable mental anguish on
account of adverse criticism for his Radames
In "Aida." It is said that Payne Clarke has
not denied that he deserved "roasting," but he
felt that he was entitled to a few shreds- of the
mantle of charity on that memorable occasion
when he sang the part of the Egyptian hero.
Mr. (jiiille, the real Kadames of tho company,
had been sent on ahead to rest for the opening
performance, but rumor says that Mr. Guille
found on taking up the Monday papers that he
had not teen given the prominence due to his
merits in the way of interviews, and, therefore,
declined to sing. Whatever his reason, he cer
tainly refused to appear, and Payne Clarke,
who had never sung Kadames without the
score and who had just arrived from a 'long
journey, was good-natured enough to save the
performance by appearing at a dtcide<l dis
advantage. There are few artists who would
have been so self-sacrificing.
Musical celebrities are beginning to shower
upon us. The latest announcement is that
Martin P. Marsiek is on his way here to give a
series of concerts. He is one of the leading
violinists in Paris, and is the great proiessorof
die violin at the Paris Conservatory. Marsick
is a native of Liege, Belgium, and at 12 years
of age was organist of Liege Cathedral and
soprano soloist of the great religious festivals.
Later he went to perfect his studies at the
MARSICK, THE BELGIAN VIOLINIST OF PARISIAN REPUTATION.
Brussels Conservatory under Leonard, but,
having more than his usual share of the artis
tic tendency to resent rivalry, he shook the
dust of the conservatory from his feet at the
age of 15 because he had been debarred on ac
count of his youth from receiving a prize.
Marsick went to Paris and graduated at the
conservatory, after which the seal of success
was set upon him by Vieuxtemps, who pub
licly unbraced the young violinist for playing
his fourth concerto. Marsick is well known at
the Colonne and Lamoureux concerts, and has
also toured with success through Holland,
Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Russia
and England. This is his first visit to Amer
ica, and partly owing to differences of opinion
with his manager he did not at first create the
enthusiasm in the East that was expected.
Lately, however, he has aroused considerably
more public interest. The critics have always
spoken in the highest terms of his scholarly
work, which is said to show to the best ad
vantage in chamber concerts.
Siegfried Wagner, the son of the Bayreutn
master, has just created a great sensation in
Vienna, where he was invited by Hans Eichter
to make his first appearance before the Vien
nese public by directing an orchestral concert
at the Imperial Opera. The young man con
ducted with great sentiment the idylle of
"Siegfried," the delightful excerpt which the
happy father dedicated to his son when he was
only an infant in arms. Afterward Siegfried
Wagner attacked Beethoven's symphony in P,
and is said to have shown real talent as a con
ductor. The Viennese were very anxious to
hear his own cantata, "Homesickness" (Sehn
sucht), which Siegfried Wagner haa written on
Schiller's celebrated verses and which has
been already performed in Munich, but he ex
cused himself from appearing as a composer
during his visit to Vienna. It is a quarter of a
century since Richard Wagner conducted in
the Austrian capital for the last time. Tnat
was in May, 1872, and lie gave his concert to
raise funds for the Bayreuth enterprise. More
than 50,000 francs were cleared. It is true
that Wagner offered the first fruits of the
"Xibelungen." and among other fragments
the famous fire incantation from the "Valky
rie," whose first execution has become legend
ary, for the elements mixed real lightning and
thunder with the music. The- resemblance of
Siegfried to his father has been greatly com
mented on in Vienna; his eves, however, are
said to reflect a vague souvenir of his grand
father, Fratiz LUzt. Siegfried has been so much
sneered at as "the son 01 his father" that it 13
quite retreshiug to find him receiving a little
consideration on his own account.
"Jennie Deans," theopera founded by Joseph
Bennett on Sir Walter Scott's novel, "The
Heart of Midlothian;" and composed by Ham
ish MacCunu, has just been given for the first
time in London. Scotland, of whom it was
contemptuously said not many years since
that she had not produced a single composer
of genius, seems now coming to the front in
this department of art, and among the most
talented writers must certainly be placed Mac-
Cunn. His overture, "Land of the Mountain
and the Flood," and svmphonic poem, "The
Ship o' the Fiend," have proved him a tone
poet of uo mean order, and if his first essay in
grand opera cannot be called a masterpiece it
at any rate is said to aftbrd evidence that with
due experience he may give something to the
world in the department of lyric drama which
the world will not willingly let die. Joseph
Bennett has taken just as much of the original
story as was convenient for bis libretto.
Cardinal Perraud, Bishop of Autun and a
member of tl'e French Academy, has just
written a book on music according to Plato.
Its title is "Eurythmie et Harmonie." The
author expounds the Platonic doctrine of the
assimilation of music ar.d morals, and devel
opes this thought by quotations from the Scrip
tures. "The wise man is a musician, and virtue
is harmony."
A dispatch from Odessa says: "The Russian
composer, Alexander Fedoroff, has just pro
duced a lyric drama, "The Fountain of Tears,"
which has been received with enormous en
thusiasm at Ekaterinsolaf. All the papers
speak in the highest terms of the music, the
libretto for which was based on a fable by
Pouschkine. A French translation of "The
Fountain of Tears" is already being made.
The Regio Theater at Turin has given the
first representation of Maestro Conti's new
opera, "Savitri." The reception accorded the
work was favorable, but not enthusiastic.
Nine calls were given the composer, but that
was very little for Italy.
PARAGRAPHS ABOUT PEOPLE.
Leo XIII and the Due d'Aumale have been
made honorary members of the St. Petersburg
Imperial Academy of Sciences.
President Cleveland still remains silent as to
his desire to experience the "ex" rays.
General Horace Porter at a recent eiub din
ner in New York said that the first half of. a

A MISPLACED MONARCH.
"Kmperor William," said a well-informed
and discerning Frenchmau last summer to an
American traveler, '-is precisely the kind of
monarch that the great majority of the French
people would delight to have as their ruler."
Unquestionably, if Emperor William, instead
of being the head of the ilohenzoliern family,
had been the head of the Bourbon, the Orleans
or the Bonaparte family, and had in this way
come to the throne of France, as, with his fa
voring personal qualities, it is not unlikely he
would have come, in spite of the republic, he
would without doubt have been fcr the
French the idol of the people in a way
that he never can be with his Ger
man subjects. Their devotion is for "Unser
Fritz," or the old Emperor, the good but
somewhat commonplace, ruler and fighter,
who will stand at his palace window each
morning at a certain hour to see his troops go
by; who will lead what the French would call
a bourgeoise species of domestic life â that is,
quietly and after the rather tame middle-class
method â but a man who will never startle
them by doing anything thtft in unexpected,
nor make too frequent demands upon them for
displays of personal enthusiasm.
The French, on the other hand, have in the
past delighted in having over them a man who
kept himself constantly in evidence. General
Boulanger almost succeeded in securing a dic
tatorship by his pleasing personal bearing and
the art which he showed in attracting notice
at military reviews and on other public occa
sions.
The Frenchman who looks back over his
national history finds in such sovereigns as
Henry IV and iu Louis. XIV, particularly the
former, the type of man who has appealed
most powerfully to the popular mind. There
has been iu them that exaggerated egotism
that monarehs who win the adoration of peo
ple like the French must possess. They have
entire confidence in themselves and in their
judgment ana demand and expect to receive
thÂ» unquestioning confidence and respect of
their people. This quality of supreme egotism
is one which the present Emperor William of
I Germany possesses in a markr-d degree, while
! he has that uncomfortable readiness to make
i rash, though btirring, remarks which, while
! they give to many of his German subjects an
| uneasy feeling of alarm and make some of
them question whether his mind is jentirely
sound, would, if he were the ruler of France,
arouse the delighted admiration of his people
from one end o? the country to the other.
It is probably fortunate for the world at
large that this logical union of a people and a
sovereign has not occurred; that, in place of
it, the man who would be a fitting ruler of the
French is their greatest hereditary enemy,
j wnile the people who would be the devoted
I and loyal subjects of such a ruler are now
; struggling with the attemptâ to them by no
â  means easy oneâ of giving to principles that
; ascendency which, in the past they have given
to men. The French are undergoing a hard,
but necessary, disciplinary course, which in a
generation or two may make of them a
stronger and more self-reliant, if less impul
sive, Deople. On the other hand, if the some
times erratic Emperor of the Germans was the
ruler over such impassioned and devoted a
people as ihe French could be made to be, it is
questionable whether the peace of Europe
could long be maintained.â Boston Herald.

IVAN KOVALEV
WHO IS TO HANG
He Faced Almost Certain
Death at Sea in His Si
berian Escape.
HIS LOCAL RECEPTION.
Arrested by the Immigration
Commissioner, but Quickly
Released.
A WARNING WAS NOT HEEDED.
Captain Lees Told the Ten Russian
Convicts That They Must Obey
American Laws.
Ivan Kovalev, the Russian convict who
is to be hanged at Foisom Prison to-mor
row for killing aged Mr. and Mrs. Weber,
is one of the ten convicts who escaped
from the Island of Saghalien in 1893. It is
probable that he and his associates were
murderers before they pot away from the
prison island. Two of them had been sen
tenced by the Russian Government for
outrages which merit life imprisonment
in this country, but the others claimed
when here to have been arrested only for
political conspiracy, and there was no
contrary evidence. They were all re
garded as dangerous criminals when they
Ivan Kovalev, the Russian Murderer
Who Is to He Hanged To- Morrow.
[Draicn from a photograph.]
were under arrest here, and upon releasing
the prisoners Captain Loes considered it
his duty to deliver, by the aid of an in
terpreter, a wartime lectilre on the advisa
bility of obeying the laws of this country.
How much that lecture was needed and
how little attention was paid to it are
shown by this record of three of the men:
One shot dead in San Jose while at
tempting to rob a store, another sentenced
to San Quentin for burglary in San Fran
cisco and Kovalev to be hanged to-morrow.
Kovalev was regarded by the local
officials as the least vicious and dangerous
of the lot.
The ten prisoners of the Czar were serv
ing indefinite sentences, according to
their testimony, when the}' found the op
portunity to escape from Saghalien. Their \
story, as told to Walter P. Stradley, the i
Commissioner of Immigration, was that a j
Hebrew peddier. rowed to the island in
August, 1893, and that, being willing to sell
anything that he possessed, he sold his
boat to them.
There is an idea, however, that the ped
dler was murdered by the convicts in or
der to obtain the boat and to prevent the
owner from giving information to the au
thorities. |
At any rate the boat was obtained, and
with but little food or water the convicts
started for Japan. They were picked up
by an American whaler ten days later and
were brought to this City. Commissioner
Stradley arrested them, out after an in
vestigation the authorities at "Washington
ordered that the prisoners be released.
The affidavit of Kovalev, signed on No
vember 13, 18f>3. is as follows:
lam 25 years of age. 1 was born in Russia,
In the city of Haroov. I am a shoemaker. I
know nobody In America. I have no money.
la the year 1888 the Russian Government ar
rested about fifteen nihilist workingmen in
my native city. I attempted to lake their part
and help them ana was arrested as a nihilist.
I was tried and sent- to the island of Sag
halien to serve an indefinite sentence. I
escaped the same time and in the same man
ner as my nine companions. I was tranferred
from the whaler Charles W. Morgan to the
â whaler Cape Horn Pigeon and arrived here on
the night of November 9, 1893.
Ivan Kovalev.
The story of the rescue of the ten men
is related in the affidavit of Captain J. A.
M. Earle of the American whaling bark
Charles W. Morgan, as follows:
On September 3, 1893, while in the Okhotsk
Sen, about forty miles from the land, and while
the boats were down whaling, an open boat
came alongside of the bark containing ten
Russian subjects, who reported being out ten
days in their boat, during threo of which they
had been without food or water.
They said that they had escaped from a
Siberian prison and asked to be taken on
board. As an act of humanity I complied with
their request, for to have left them in that con
dition would have meant death, especially as a
gale came up the next day which would have
destroyed their boat.
1 retained them all on board until September
25, then transferred five of them to the Ameri
can whaling bark Cape Horn Pigeon, for lack
of accommodations on my own vessel. The re
maining live I gave passage to this port and
provided clothing, as they were in a destitute
condition when they came on board my ship.
The Morgan arrived here on November
7, 1893, and the Cape Horn Pigeon reached
port two days later. Kovalev came on the
latter vessel. On the arrival of the con
victs Commissioner Stradley was notified.
Being in doubt whether the immigration
laws applied to the case, the latter official
telegranhed to Washington for instruc
tions and he was ordered to arrest and
detain the ten men pending an examina
tion. On November 9 the convicts were
arrested, the five who arrived on the Mor
gan being then on exhibition at a low
grade saloon theater on Market street.
After the testimony had been submitted
by Commissioner Stradlev the authorities
at Washington decided to release the pris
oners. Xo notification of the reason for
the decision accompanied the order of re
lease, but the Commissioner believes that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THUSRDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1596.
t lie prisoners were not regarded as immi
grant?, having been picked dp in distress
on the open sea and brought here against
their will by American vessels.
No interest En the case was ever officially
manifested by the Russian Government.
At the release of the prisoners Captain
Lees addressed the ten men. He told them
that they had come to a free country,
where they could enjoy all the advantages
afforded to any others. They would have
a good deal of liberty here, he said, but the
people in this country would not tolerate
tne manifestation of any nihilistic or an
archistic tendencies. If any of them should
become lawless ttiey would have to accept
the punishment.
That ended the wirning. To-morrow
the threatened punishment will be meted
out to a third member of the gang.
A BRUTAL WIFE-BEATER
Judge Campbell Severely lectures
Thomas ltrennan, a Burly
Longshoreman.
Thomas Brennan, a longshoreman, was
convicted in Judge Campbell's court yes
terday of beating his wife. She appeared
in court with a big black lump on her left
cheek under the eye, and begged the Judge
to be lenient with her husband for the sake
of her children. During their married life
she had borne to him ten children, and five
were alive. He was a good husband, ex
cept when he was drunk. She admitted
he was very often in that condition, spend
ing all his wages in drink.
'â¢The whipuing-post is the best thing for
such men as you," said the Judge, "and if
E had the power I would order you to get
thirty lashes on your bare back with a
rawhide. I had made up my mind to give
you six months in the County Jail, but as
your poor children would be the actual
sufferers and not you I will for their sake
withhold sentence for thirty days.
"Meantime you will have to give your
wife $3 per week for the support of the
children, and if, at any time, a complaint
be made to me that you are not paying
that amount, or that you are beating your
wife, I will at. once issue a bench warrant
for your arrest and send you to jail."
Brennan declared that he would pay t he
amount regularly and would not touch an
other drop of drink.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The City of Puebla Leaves for
Victoria With Many
Passengers.
Conference of the Harbor Commission
ers and Architects on the
New Ferry Depot.
Amonsr the passengers who sailed on the
City of Puebla yesterday for Victoria, B.
C, were A. E. Pryor and Harry W. Good
all of the firm of Piper, Aden, Goodall &
Co. It is rumored along the front that
they are going to Seattle to purchase one
of the sound steamers for use in the bay.
If she comes here the chances are that she
would be used in connection with tne line
of railroad to be built from San Jose to the
waters of the bay. When spoken to about
the matter both Pryor and Goodall denied
that they were going to the sound on busi
ness, but said they were merely on pleas
ure bent. They will be gone about two
weeks, nnd expect to enjoy themselves.
As Pryor is anything but a good sailor the
chances are that all his fun will come
when he reaches terra firma. Goodall
conies of a family of sailors, and he will
revel in "a life on the ocean wave."
There was an important conference in
the ollice of tho Harbor Commissioners
yesterday. Bes'de President Colnon and
Commissioners Cole and Chad bourne there
were present Harold Wheeler, represent
ing the A. Page Brown estate; E. R.
Bwayne, the newly appointed architect,
and Walter Coffman, who appeared for E.
S. Stratton, who is sick. The discussion
was all over the detailed drawings for the
new ferry depot. Swayne admitted that
the ones made in tho otlice of the deceased
architect were probably all right, but still
he would not take the responsibility of
constructing the depot from them. He
wanted to make his own detailed draw
ings, and then he would know where he
stood.
Wheeler, as representative of the Brown
estate, argued, that the drawings ought to
be accepted and paid for. They had been
completed in good faith, mainly under the
supervision of Mr. Brown, anil therefore
the board was liable for the money. This
was the rock on which the Brown estate
and E. R. Swayne split, and the confer
ence was called in order to have the Com
missioners solve the problem.
President Colnon said that Mr. Swayne
was the newly appointed architect, but
that he would have to look for his re
muneration from the Brown estate. If the
two could not reach an agreement then
working plans would have to be made by
some one. The whole matter finally re
solved itself into a question of dollars and
cents, and the discussion finally went over
for a few days in order to allow the inter
ested parties to arrive at an amicable set
tlement. Should Mr. Swayne agree to
erect the building from the late Page
Brown's working plans, then there will be
plain sailing; but if he docs not, then new
ones will have to be made and the trustees
of the estate of the dead architect will sue
for the work done on the plans now ready
for use.
Governor Budd made an extended tour
of the water front yesterday. He was in
the City to attend the meeting of the Board
of Regents of the State University, and
seized the opportunity to inspect the work
being done by the Harbor Commissioners.
He was driven around by Chief Wharfinger
Root, and spoke very highly of the man
ner in which tilings were being conducted.
He particularly admired the new Pacific
street wharf, now in course of construction,
and thought it would prove to be the
longest lived of all the piers along the
front.
Changes in the revenue fleet still
go on. Captain Roath left yesterday
for the north to take charge of the cutter
Corwin. On his arrival the vessel will sail
for Sitka, where she will relieve the Wol
cott, the latter going to Seattle for repairs.
Captain Manger of the Corwin takes charge
of the buildiinr of the new Custom-house
launch, the Golden Shore, now being con
structed for San Francisco.
The tug Ethel and Marion will run ex
cursions to the Italian, man-of-war Cristo
foro Colombo next Saturday and Sunday.
The California Navigation and Improve
ment Company's steamer J. D. Peters has
been laid up for a thorough overhauling.
It will be some time before the work is
completed and in the meantime the Mary
Garrett will run in her place.
There is trouble brewing over the cargo
of the steamer Willamette. As stated pre
viously in The Call it was transferred
from tne George W. Elder to the Columbia
and from the latter to the Willamette.
All three broke down, and it has been said
that there will be three general averages
on the consignments. Captain Cushman
Jaughs at the story, however, and says
that there was only a few cases of salrnou
damaged durinc the various transfers.
A Chicken Thief.
James Coakley, an ex-convict, was arrested
in the Mission at an early hour yesterday
morning Dy Policemen Blackman and Harris.
He had in a sack thirty-lour chickens, which
the police nave good reason to believe were
stolen from some henroost. He is being de
tained pending inquiries as to tne owner of
the hens.

BANKER KLEINSCHMITS.
One of the Famous Pioneers of
Montana on a Visit
Here.
BOUGHT MILLIONS IN DUST.
Mr. Kleinschmits* Story of the Ac
tivity in the Gold Camps and on
the Cattle Ranges.
T. H. Kleinschmits, the millionaire
banker of Montana, three times Mayor of
Helena and interested in many great
enterprises throughout the West, is at the
Occidental.
Mr. Kleinschmits is one of the pioneers
of Montana. He settled at Virginia City,
in that then Territory, in 1864. Two years
Jater he went to Helena and engaged in
banking. During his experience in the
latter business he has bought more than
$28,000,000 in gold nuggets and dust. He
handled a large amount of the product of
Aider Gulch and of other famous camps in
Montana.
He is recognized as one of the ablest
MILLIONAIRE T. C. KLEINSCIIMITS OF MONTANA.
[Sketched by a "Call artist."]
business men in the country. Mr. Klein
schmits says that Montana has improved
greatly in a business way lately.
"There is a general renewal of confi
dence not only there but elsewhere where
I have been," he said. "In Montana men
are now casting around for investments.
It is very different from what it was a
short time ago.
"We have been in Montana aJmostwith
out any winter. I have never seen one so
mild. The cattle are in excellent shape.
We haveu't lost one. and we won't now.
for it always happens that when cattle are
slick and fat at this time of the year the
cold spring weather does not affect them.
"Sheep are also in fine fettle. There are
many of them, as there are of cattle, for
these two industries are very extensive in
Montana. We shall have a great deal of
wool, mutton ana beef this year.
"As for the mines, we are digging deeper
tnan formerly and finding bigtrer and
richer veins. We are not trying to dis
cover more silver, because it is too cheap.
However, we are working the big silver
mines at Butte, Anaconda and Elsenboro.
But the main idea in Montana lately, as
in Colorado, haÂ«Â» been to develop more
gold mines. We have had great success
in this. Eighty miles from Helena lately
a good gold mine has been opened which
returns $200 to the tun â about four times
what the best mines tiiere ordinarily re
turned. This is something immense,
especially when it is remembered that it it
only went $9 to the ton it would pay well.
"They are aevelopinc a new district in a
part of the Kocky Mountains next to
Idaho ; known as the BlacKfeet Range. It
is an area about eighteen by seventy miles
in extent, which has recently been ceded
to Montana by the Blackfeet Indians. It
appears to be rich in gold. Many other
districts are being opened.
"I think the mineral product will in
crease from year to year. The product of
Montana last year was about $48,000,000.
It will be more than that this vear."
Mr. Kleinschmits is executor of the
estate of a Montana man who lately died
in Oakland, and he is here to attend to it
and also to visit a lemon ranch which he
owns near San Diego. He has several in
terests in California aside from the latter.
He has lately withdrawn from the First
National Hank of Helena, of which he was
bo long executive officer, and retired from
active business. Mr. Kleinschmits' fortune
has been acquired solely by his own efforts
as he had no money when he drifted into
Virginia City.
He has bought more dust and nuggets
than any other man in the West.
THE POTTER INQUEST.
A Verdict of Accidental Death Re
turned by tho Coroner's
Jury.
The Coroner's inquest yesterday re
turned a verdict to the effect that the
death of H. Cranston Potter was acci
dental.
Dr. A. G. Hicks came down from racoma
to give his testimony at the inquest. He
was the last person to see Potter aJive at
the Cliff House on the evening of Febru
ary 7. They dined together, and while
they drank a whisky cocktail before din
ner and a quart of champagne during the
meal he did not consider Potter intoxi
cated.
The witness and Potter left the Cliff
House at 7:45 o'clock. The former wanted
co take the Sutro electric cars back to town
and his companion wanted to take the
steam dummy.
Hicks said he walked down the hill for
about 100 paces with Potter trying to per
suade him to take the Sutro cars but
deceased was obstinate and refused .' Wit
ness said Potter was an independent man,
and when he made up his mind to do a
thing no one could induce him to do other
wise. Witness took the 7:45 butro car for
the City. He was positive deceased was
not intoxicated when he left him. It was
a very dark night. â¢
Hicks stated that Potter acted contrary
to everything thai he (Hicks) would say,
as if he desired to get rid of him. "Witness
had an appointment with deceased at the
Occidental Hotel on Saturday evening;
but, as Potter did not put in an appearance,
he concluded that he had gone off with
other friends. Hicks had a ticket for
Tacorna on the Walla Walla, which sailed
the following day, and, as he expected
Potter to leave for Tacoma by train on
Tuesday, Hicks made the trip on the Walla
Walla. '
BURIED AT TACOMA.
James Brown Potter Attended the Funeral of
the Unfortunate Young Man.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 19.â The funeral
of H. Cranston Potter took place at 3
o'clock this afternoon from his late home,
312 North Cliff avenue. None but rela
tives and intimate friends of the deceased
were present. Rev. Preston Barr, rector
of St. Luke's Episcopal Church, officiated.
Many beautiful rlowers, the tributes of
friends, were piled about the casket. The
remains, which were embalmed and rest
ing in a handsome casket, were sealed in
a metallic shell this afternoon and shipped
to New York City by express.
James Brown Potter, brother of the de
ceased, who arrived in the city yesterday,
will not return to New York with the re
mains, but will stay here to settle up the
affairs of the dead man.
Another Noe Suit.
Once more the Noe case has come into court,
this time with lour solid pages of defendants,
numbering altogether several thousand. The
.suit is brought in place of a former suit with a
much less imposing list of defendants, because
the former list was so incomplete. As in the
former action, the plaintiffs in the suit just
filed are Miguel Noe, Vincent Xoe, Cataliiia
Splivalo and Catalina Noe.
CAPTAIN LANE'S TRIAL
It Has Opened With Objections
From Defendant's
Counsel.
The Shattuck Case and Judge Belcher's
Remarks Mixed Up in the
Proceedings.
The Lane case opened with an objection.
When the case was called Carroll Cook
submitted a demurrer, some challenges an
objection and an exception to the remarks
of Judge Belcher about the Shattuck jury,
made last Friday. He declared that Â«o
discharge the jurors from the panel was an
illegally proceeding, and one which inter
fered with the rights of the defendant,
Lane.
The dismissal of the jurors, counsel
said, was equivalent to a refusal by the
Sheriff to summon jurors regularly drawn
to serve upon a panel in a court, which ac
tion on the part of the Sheriff, counsel
maintained, is ground for a challenge to
the entire panel. In closing his affidavit
on the subject, the defendant Lane made
this statement:
That in preparing for his trial affiant learned
from the records of the court who the jurors
in attendance thereon were, made investiga
tions as to their characters, reputations and
opinions in general, and now romes to this
court prepared to proceed with the trial of
this cause, anticipating that the said jurors
hereinbefore named, would all of them
form a part of the panel of jurors in attend
ance upon this court and from which a jury in
this cause would be drawn. Finding that
such names have been, without legal cause
ordered taken from the jury-box of trial jurors
in attendance upon this court and said de
partment thereof, affiant objects to proceed
ing with said trial or to proceeding to draw a
jury until said jurors shall again have been
notified to be in attendance upon said court
and until their nnmes, or at least the names of
all except KittreJpe, Ash and Walker, shall
have been replaced in said jury-box, or that
the entire panel of jurors in attendance upon
this court shall be dismissed and a new venire
of jurors drawn to serve on the trial of this
cause.
R. B. Kittredge, W. L. Ashe and W. D.
Walker of the Shattuck jury had served
their terms anyway, and so were not in
cluded in Cook's objection. R. A. Muller
the man who had stood out for "guilty. 1 *
had been ordered restored to the panel
after two weeks.
Judge Belcher overruled all the objec
tions and exceptions, and then the Lane
trial proceeded.
Five jurors were secured during the fore
noon, and then the case went over until
this morning, when it is hoped Mr. Knight
now engaged in the Turner case, can be
present. Cook's questions indicated that
he is anxious to secure jurors who have
no children. He seemed particularly
anxious to be rid of any juror in whose
family there are little girl?.
This is the first charge against Lane to
come before the Superior Court.
In fighting a duel the principals are gen
erally placed twelve paces distant from
each other.

HOME FOR NEWSBOYS
The Charitable Enterprise of
Mr. and Mrs. A. C.
Stevens.
A ROOF GARDEN MADE.
A Non-Sectarian Institution Which
All Churches and the Public Are
Asked to Aid.
The Newsboys' Home, at 113 Powell
street, will be opened this evening.
There are ten large, sunny rooms in
course of furnishiner, and at the front a
roof garden is about to be made, where
boys may eat icecream and exchange the
jokes and stories of the craft.
The lirst floor will be devoted to a res
taurant, excepting one room for an office
or sitting-room. On the second floor will
be gamerooms, reading-rooms, workrooms
and bathrooms.
It is designed that in connection with
the home will be established a stamp sav
ings society, an employment bureau, a
weekly paper, an industrial department, in
charge of competent teachers; a laundry
agency, a package delivery system, a news
paper exchange, a library, restaurant and
barber-shop.
The amusements include musical enter
tainments, socials at which refreshments
will be served, writing, drawing, stamp
albums and scrapbooks, and it is intended
that new features will be added as soon as
practicable.
Mr. and Mrs. A. Chesley Stevens of 112
Liberty street are the promoters of the
plan. The story of their interest in the
work is an interesting one. Last summer
the young couple started on a tour around
the world. They stopped at Duluth,
Minn., and there became interested in the
work known as the Bethel Home of that
city. So much were they absorbed in this
work that they resolved to abandon their
plan of a tour around the globe and re
turned to San Francisco resolved to under
take a similar work. They looked over the
Held thoroushly, and the result has been
their conclusion that helping working
boys to an education, to save a little
money for a start, in business and to pro
vide them with the surroundings of a re
lined club life is the worthiest work in
which they could engage.
They hope to make the institution in
every sense a public one. A board of man
agers will soon be formed, and an appeal
to the churches for aid in furnishing the
rooms has been made. Mr. Stevens has
become responsible for the rent.
His purpose is to make the home self
supporting as soon as possible. To this end
a restaurant will be opened which the pub
lic is asked to patronize.
It is not yet decided, and will not be
until the board of managers meets, whether
a nominal charge will be made to the
boys.
Provisions vill be made for a temporary
home for such boys as are without an
abiding place.
There will De an employment bureau
and, in time, connection with a training
school for boys.
The great need now is for substantial
furniture in all the rooms.
The institution is to be non-sectarian,
and the help of all churches is desired.
This evening the Methodist deaconesses
will have charge of the entertainment, to
which all working boys are invited.
The hospitality of the home will not be
restricted to newsboys.
An Abandoned Baby.
A baby girl, about a week old, was found in
a basKet on the Bteps of 409 Vallejo street, at
an early hour yesterday morninsr, by the
policeman on the beat. It was sent to the Re
ceiving Hospital and yesterday afternoon was
taken to Mount St. Joseph Orphan Asylum.
It was poorly clad.
The halcyon alluded to by the poets is
the bird called the kingfisher. It is believed
by the ancients that while the female
brooded over the cues the spa and weather
remained calm and unruffled; hence arose
the expression of halcyon days.

MRS. COOPER READS
HER STATEMENT
Repeats the Charges Al
ready Existing Against
Dr. Brown.
THE SITUATION STATED.
Fears Expressed That Mrs. Stock
ton Has Been Induced Not
to Appear.
NEW EVIDENCE IS SUBMITTED.
The Pastor on Cross â¢ Examination
Scores One or Two Very
Strong Points.
Mrs. Cooper, as had been predicted, pre
ferred serious charges against Dr. Brown
yesterday. She declared, with much
earnestness, that the Overman-Tunnell let
ters are genuine, supporting this state
ment with evidence, which the pastor will
probably lind some difficulty in overcom
i:ip.
She claimed among other things that Dr.
Brown, in his acquaintance with Mrs. Al
bertine Stockton, was not ministerial, his
conduct at various times proving him to be
unfitted to continue in pastoral work, and
Mrs. Cooper also sets forth as a fact that
Mrs. Blanchard had been intimidated into
j-igninz a statement which Dr. Brown knew
to be false.
Mi>s Hattie Cooper supported her
mother in a .supplementary charge, alleg
ing that Miss Overman conspired with
Mrs. Tunnell, and that the two occupied
a room for one week prior to the arrest of
Mrs. Davidson. Tiie nature of the con
spiracy was not named in the charge
handed the committee. Miss Cooper also
alleged that Mrs. Tunnell was spirited
away from the home of Dr. Brown, inti
mating that if she wa3 present the pastor
would ii:id himself amid a sea of breakers
from which he could not be extricated.
Fne committee on charges spent a busy
three hours yesterday morning. First
tame Mr. Mason of "the Christian En
deavor Society. lie had prepared a
charge to the effect that Dr. Brown, had
tiud to intimidate a young lady member
of his church who "nad expressed an
opinion as to the pastor's gui;t.
The force used was embodied in an ex
pressed determination to assail the young
â woman's character unless she should un
dergo a change of heart. Mr. Mason's
charge was backed up with an affidavit
Prominent Figures at the Congregational Church Council â E. C. Williams Read
ing the Charges Formulated From the Newspaper Articles.
[Sketched from life yesterday by a "Call" artist.]
in which all the facts of the alleged act
were recited. There was a hitch, however,
in presenting this charge to the council,
and it was found in the desire to withhold
the name of the young lady. The matter
was finally passed, to be taken up at the
evening session should there be a demand
for it.
Mrs. Cooper and her daughter were the
next to appear before the committee, the
substance of tneir charges being given
above.
When the doors leading to the lecture
room were opened for the afternoon ses
sion there was a momentary crush, which
subsided when it was found that there was
room for all. The ticket of admission
â scheme seemed to have fallen through, for
the general public found no difficulty in
gaining admittance.
Itn. Brown and >iit-s Overman came
early, securing seats in the front row.
Just across the aisie Bat Mrs. Cooper and
her daughter, Miss H attic, and on 'the left
of the former was Mrs. Lena Blanchard,
who figured in ihe affidavits charging Mrs.
Cooper with Ituffing the church ballot.
At 2 o'clock Dr. Brown came by a side
ilour, carrying a handbag. Ten minutes
inter the council liied into the room, and
was immediately called to order bv Mod
erator McLean requesting Dr. Pond to
i<-:id in prayer- liev. J. M. 'fenny of San
Jose was the only member absent, he hav
ing been called Home to attend a funeral.
Attorney Woodhams on motion of. Mr.
Hoyt was made, not without objection
from Dr. Brown, judge advocate of the
council with privilege of a seat on the
platform. Mr. Yvoodhams' special duties
arc to look after the interest of both prose
i ution and defense in a perfectly impartial
way. The report of the committee on
changes was ti>en presented by Ctiairmnu
Hoyt. He said there was a difference of
opinion among the committee concerning
the matter of revising the newspaper
statements of the charges against Dr.
Brown, and he would read the shorter re
port, which is as follows:
l'our committee of three has received the
following charges in writ ins. a 'id properly
signed, copies of which have been put in the
hands of Dr. Brown:
Firstâ That the Overman letters are gen
uine.
Secondâ That Pr. Brown in his acquaintance
with Mrs. Albertine Stockton was not ministe
rial in his conduct.
Thirdâ That Pr. Brown has been guilty of
Intimidation to Mrs. Lena BlanchÃrd.
Fourthâ That Pr. Brown was concerned in a
conspiracy with Miss Overman lo spirit Mrs.
Tunnell away *roru this City secretly.
At the evening session Mrs. Cooner gave
to the council a lengthy and well-worded
statement of her knowledge of the charges
pgainst Dr. Brown. With the exception
of one or two new points the document
presented nothing that has not already
been published. She sprang a surprise oh
the accused pastor and his friends when
she declared that her first positive knowl
edge of wrongdoing came wh.n Rev. Mr.
Coplin informed her by letter that lie
knew a Christian lady who was familiar
with the alleged misconduct of Dr. Brown
and Miss Overman.
Mrs. Cooper said that the pastor's rela
tions with Mrs. Stockton were true in de
tail and fact, that lady having admitted as
much to her. Mie had learned, however,
that an effort had been made to prevent
the widow's appearance before the coun
cil, but that she (Mrs Cooper) had
faith in her ultimately coming. Concern
ing the disappearmg'of Mrs. Tunnell she
said that she had been informed by a re
porter that the lady in question left the
home of Dr. Brown about 11 :30 o'clock on
the Sunday night following the arrest of
Mrs. Davidson. She made her exit by
means of a side or rear door.
On cross-examination by Dr. Brown,
Mrs. Cooper was asked to repeat the state
ment about Mrs. Tunnell, and the pastor
then said that he had asked this for a
purpose as there was neither side nor rear
entrance to his home.
The full statement of Mrs. Cooper, to
gether with the days proceedings, will be
found below.
Considerable matter has been printed
recently concerning some supposed
trouble Dr. Brown had with a student at
Oberlin. The following telegram is self
explanatory:
SPRINGFIELD, Ohio, Feb. 19.â An Elyria
(Ohio) special here to-day say* l>r. C. O. Brown,
the Congregational preacher of San Francisco,
who has gained especial notoriety on account
of charges brought by Mr?. Davidson, a mem
ber of his church, was at one time a student at
Oberlin College. Young Brown and the entire
Brown family were of good character, being
considered honest, religious and upright. At
IS years of age the young man married Miss
Mary Wheat of Oberlin, but as it was against
the rules for a student to marry, he was com
pelled to leave the college. He' pursued his
studies elsewhere.
The council will meet again to-day at 2
o'clock, when the examination of Mrs.
Cooper will be resumed.
CHARGES FORMULATED.
One Sat of Accusations Based on
Letters Submitted to the Coun
cil by Mrs. Cooper.
Dr. W. C. Pond opened the session of
the council in the afternoon with prayer.
He returned thanks for tne harmonious
character of the proceedings of Tuesday
ami asked that the same conditions might
bless the proceedings of yesterday.
The moderator â Among the last items of
business last night was the appointment
of a committee of three to receive and
formulate charges against Dr. Brown, to
be investigated by the council.
At this point there was a demand for a
rollcall, and this was ordered by the mod
erator. It showed all present, except Rev.
J. M. Tenney of San Jose, who had been
called home on some urgent business.
In response to the request of the mod
erator for the report of the committee on
charges, its chairman, Dr. H. N. Hoyt of
Sacramento, announced that the commit
tee had prepared two reports. One was
formulated fiom letters makimr certain
charges, which had been submitted by
two ladies, and the other outlining the
method of procedure before the council.
He was asked to read the latter first, and
did so, as follows:
It is the recommendation of your joint com
mittee of five that the case of Dr. Brown, before
this council, be conducted by an officer or eom
mitteemnn, with duties similar to those of
judge advocate; that is to say, said officer or
committecman to have charge of the presenta
tion of all evidence to come belore the council
and to question all witnesses in examination,
both direct and cross, excepting the right al
ready accorded Dr. Brown to appear in his own
defense as counsel representing himself; and
also excepting the right of any member of the
council to propose questions to any witness
I under examination.
Dr. Hoyt nominated Mr. Woodhams to
take charge of the presentation of evidence
to the council. This brought Dr. Brown
to his feet in an objective mood. He said:
1 do not rise positively to oppose this, but to
suggest merelv. I would be very glad to ac
cept Mr. Woodhams as the prosecuting officer
in this case. But it seems to me anomalous to
me that he who has alwnys been a friend and
who has voted for me on every question that
has arisen of late should be now asked to take
a position directly opposed to me. It would be
unfair to him and unpleasant, and he would
be placed in an embarrassing position as my
prosecutor.
Hoytâ The thought expressed by Dr. Brown
was not in the mind of the committee. We
were not selecting a man to prosecute Dr.
Brown, but one who is simply to be the busi
ness agent of the council to present the proper
matters to it for its action.
Dr. Brown's attention was called to the

use of the words in the report of the com
mittee which defined the duties of such a
person as being similar to those of a judge
advocate â one who is to act in a strictly
impartial mannerâ and then withdrew all
opposition to the appointment of Mr.
Woodhams, who was duly elected and in
vited to take a seat on the platform *ith
the council members.
Moderator McLean called for the other
report of the committee. Before present
ing it Chairman Hoyt spoke as follows:
There was a difference of opinion among the
ti;einhprsof the committee as to whether you
had given us any other power than that of" re
ceiving and formulating charges that might he
brought to us. Some of The 'committee held
that we should formulate ana summarize
charges made up from newspapers and other
reports. V. o nave done both. I would pre
sent the briefe- report and leave to you the
disposition of the other.
Mr. Woodhams then read the following;
Your committee of. three has received the
following charges in writing, and properly
signed copies of which have beea put in, the
hands of Dr. Brown:
1. That the Overman letters are genuine.
2. That Dr. Brown, in his acquaintance with
Mrs. Albertine Stockton, was not ministerial
in his conduct.
:â (. That Dr. P.rown has been guilty of Intimi
dation in respect to Mrs. Leo a Bianchard.
4. That Dr. Brown was concerned in a con
spiracy with Miss t'v<rman to spirit Mrs. Tun
nell away from the City.
The proceedings then continued as fol
lows:
Pondâ T move that the committee be In
structed to present the second report.
Brownâ l have not received a copy of the
document read before this body. 1 was not
furnished a copy of the document just read.
Mcl*anâ Yoa said you were familiar with
those newspaper reports. We agreed to fur
nish you with copies of all documents simply
that you might not be surprised.
Brownâ l asR to have a copy of all documents
that are in the nature of charges against me
I thiuk that I am entitled to them.
It was decided to provide Dr. Brown
with copies of aJI papers, after which
Chairman Hoyt spoke as follows:
We have not selected or procured witnesses
to prove these charges. They have simply been
summarized. Two persons came before the
committee and submitted written evidence
and we have Mimmarized it, as shown in our
report. In addition to this we have prepared
another paper which summarizes the charges
in the newspaper articles.
Mooarâ l wish to know if the committee has
the evidence on which the charges in the
newspapers a*e made.
Hoy tâ We hive not had time to secure it, hut
have made inquiries as to who will testify and
where they can be found. But we are in doubt
as to what the procedure is to be, and we have
asked Mr. Woodhams to help us in this matter
I think that the report we have already made,
and the letters I hold in my hands, will make
clear as to what we should do. There are
ladies here who are ready to make statements
to substantiate these charges
K. C. Williamsâ if the newspaper charges
are brought up and the people who caused
them to be printed ao not come forward then
Dr. Brown goes clear. If these people do not
come forward we must believe that they are
afraid of the irutli, or tnat ihe matters caused
to be published by them are not true.
Dr. Pond s motion was adopted, and
Chairman Hoyt spoke as follows:
Is it the desreof the council to hear the sec
ond report previous to hearing the letters we
hold in our hands, or do you desire to leave
entirely in our possession the matters pertain
ing to the first charges?
McLeanâ TTe council has assumed the un
usual duty of ascertaining what charges there
are in the community, and I do not see how
they can go forward without formulating
charges. It is unusual for a council to show
such a deference to a church and to an accused
pastor r.s has been shown up to now in this
case. We will, therefore, hear thesa second
charges.
Chairman Hoyt read them as follows;
Charges and specifications preferred against
the Kev. C. O. Brown, pastor of First Congre
gational Church:
CHARGE 1â CONnVCT PREJUDICIAL TO THE WELFARE
OF THE CHURCH.
Specification firstâ ln this, that knowing
Mrs. Davidson to be concerned in a conspiracy
to extort a large sura of money from himself,
lie publicly recognized and treated her as a
Christian woman and spoke of her to others in
terms of approval, thereby misleading them as
to her irue character and bringing reproach
upon the Christian ministry and scandal upon
the church.
Specification secondâ ln this, that knowing
in his personal experience that Mrs. Stockton
was guilty of permitting immodest and im
proper liberty by the opposite sex. he made no
effort, as her pastor, to recall her to the right
path and warn her of the impropriety and dan
ger of her conduct.
Specification thirdâ ln this, that possessed as
he was of a knowledge oi tne tacts recited in
specification "J, he, the said CO. Brown, con
tinued his alleged intimacy with the said Mrs.
Stockton, taking her on extended trips over
the street railroads and dining with her at
public restaurants without the company or
knowledge of his wife.
Specification lourthâ ln this, that knowing
the alleged facts mentioned in the last two
yp.-eiiieations, he took no steps to bring them
to the attention of the church of which he was
the pastor and the said Mrs. Stockton a mem
ber, but by his silence and conduct toward the
said Mrs. Stockton gave ground for the belief
on the part of her fellow-members of the church
that she was living an exemplary Christina
life and was worthy of their Christian confi
dence and sympathy.
CHARGE 2â CONDUCT VNRIXOMING A CHRISTIAN
JIIMFTKK.
Specificationâ ln this, that the said C. O.
Brown, while pastor of a Christian church,
paid a large sum of money, namely $500, to
Mrs. Davidson, to be used by her in inducing
Mrs. Baddin lo withhold from the public cer
tain alleged information possessed by her relat
ing to certain scandalous or criminal conduct
on the part of said (.'. O. Brown; which money
was paid to Mrs. Davidson covertly and in
secret, without telling any one of any intent
In such payment, other than to secure the
silence of the said Mrs. Baddin and with no
provision for any concealed witness ol the
transaction and conversation connected there
with, through whose testimony the innocent
and proper Intention prompting the payment
could be understood and made ay>parent.
CHARGE 3â IMMORAL CONDUCT.
Specification firstâ ln this, that on theâ day
of â , IS9-, the said (.'. O. Brown is alleged, in
or near his study, to have pat his arms around
Mrs. Stockton and kissed her, under what she
took to be strong (animal) passion.
Specification secondâ ln tni=, that he, the said
C. O. Brown, is alleged to havp been guilty of
criminal intercourse witli Miss Overman, and
retain her in his house, knowing that his re
lations with her were in contravention of the
law, both divine and civil.
In an evident state of indignation Dr.
Brown arose at the conclusion of the report
and remarked :
Is any action to be taken upon a document
with such important blanks in itâ blank day
of li.mii!:. I was once forced to defend myself
against a woman whose mind was blank, and I
do not think 1 should be called upon to de
fend myself against such a charge unless dates
be given.
Iloyt â I wish to say a few words in explana
tion at this point. We don't feel ourselves to
be prosecutors, and don't like to be called
prosecutors. All that the committee wanted
to do was to make everything clear, and if Dr.
Brown were my brother or my fatherâ he is
my dear, personal friend â I should have to do
everything that I shall do throughout this
council. My idea is to make the matter as
clear as the noonday sun. And this I consider
the best act of friendship to Dr. Brown that
could be done by any one. Ami so I wish that
the word prosecutor and prosecution would
not be used more than necessary.
McLeanâ The extraordinary deference pakl
to the wishes of the church and its
pastor has placed this council in the
apparent attitude of a prosecutor. Our
attention has bten called to certain un
formulnted charges, and if this investiga
tion is to amount to anything the moderator
sees no way except that these charges must be
formulated, ami that we hnve assumed to
formulate them must not be construed into Â«in
unfriendly attitude. I have no doubt but that
Dr. Hoyt expresses the feeling of every mem
ber of this council. The greatest friendship
can be shown to Dr. Brown only by a thorough
investigation.
Brownâ Dr. Hoyt has been very kind in the
expression of his opinion ami in defense of his
position. I would uot iiave the slightest
nntagonism aroused by what I may say; hut I
must use certain terms tosave circumlocution,
and 1 hope the council will keep this in mind.
It is not with any feeling against any one that
I used these terms.
The report was duly adopted, and when
Moderator McLean announced that the
report was not the property of the council
Dr. Brown again spoke. lie said:
One thing ought to be amended. Facts are
spoken. 1 would like it better if they were
referred to as alleged facts.
The snijjcested change was made.
Dr. Mooar suggested that in order to
avoid the use of the word "prosecutor"
the term "investigating committee" be
hereafter used. The moderator said it
would be ao understood.
At this point the two letters on which
the first series of charges were based were
placed in the hands of Mr. Woodhams,
who read them. They follow:
For the Clerk of Congregational Councilâ My
Dear Sir: I charge that the Overman letters
incrimiuating Dr. Brown are genuine. I have
proof to substantiate tbia fact. I charge that
Dr. Brown iu his acquaintance with Mrs.
Albertine Stockton was not ministerial in his
conduct and showed himself unfitted to be a
minister of the Igospel in good standing. I
charge that Dr. Brown intimidated Mrs. Lena
Blanehard, threatening her with arrest end
Imprisonment if she did not sign a statement
which ehe told him was false. Very truly
yours, Sarah B. Cooper.
Gentlemen of the Council, Through the Commit
tee on Charge*â Dear Sirs: I charge that Miss
Overman (one of the principals in the so-called
Brown scanda') was in conspiracy with Mrs.
Tunnell, the recipient of the famous Overman
letters, and that they roomed together at the
Cosmopolitan Hotel, corner Fifth and Mission
streets, in the City of San Francisco, one week
prior to the arrest of Mrs. Davidson, now await
ing trial. From good authority I learnetl Mrs.
Tunnell was concealed in Dr. Brown's resi
dence, 1703 Cieary street, Han Francisco, aud
that she (Mrs. Tunnell) was spirited away from
the City secretly by Dr. Brown. Respectfully
and sincerely jours, Harriet Cooper.
Mr. Woodhams explained that these
to ladies had promised to appear and sub
stantiate the charges contained in the let
ters they had presented to the committee
on charges.
Brownâ lf this letter sent by Miss Har
riet Cooper is to become a matter of record
I would ask the council to suike out all
between the words "from" and "now
awaiting trial." Miss Overman is not on
trial.
Mr. Woodhams informed Dr. Brown that
he was out of order; that the council had
no power to amend any documents sub
mitted to it; that it could amend only its
own records.
Brownâ Does this letter become ft matter of
record in this form? It seeir.s to be a matter
of grave injustice to Miss Overman.
Pnrkinsonâ Those letters are not the report
of this committee. They were simply author
ized to receive letters or charges, a'nd from
.nem formulate charges or specifications
against Dr. Brown. They do not say Miss
Overman, or any one else, was engaged in a
conspiracy.
This closed the controversy on this
point. Mr. Woodhams announced that be
Was not prepared to present evidence, and
that he thought he would be prepared to
do so in the evenine. It was decidei to
defer the taking of evidence till then. Mr.
Woodhams then addressed the council as
follows:
The members of the council will realize that
it will be impossible for me to go out and get
evidence to substantiate these charges. I think
it would only be just to myself, the council
and Dr. Brown to have it understood that per
sons who have evidence should present it to
me as your representative so that I can place
it in a proper way before the council.
Mr. McLean â I may state properly now that
testimony betore a council exempts any per
son from liability for libel or slander the same
as in testifying in a civil court.
On his own suggestion Mr. Woodhams
was authorized to issue subpenaes for wit
nesses.
Dr. Brown asked to have each charge
separately specified, but Mr. Woodhams
thought they could best be considered in
the form presented.
Dr. Mooar suggested that all persons
who came to testify be placed under oath,
the sari:e to be administered by the mod
erator. The motion was divided, the first
part being passed and that authorizing the
moderator to administer t lie oath being
laid over for the evening session.
Just before the adjournment of the
afternoon meeting E. C. Williams moved
that the representatives of the press be re
quested to make a prominent notice in
their reports of the council that any one
who knows anything about these charges
should report tiie same to Mr. Woodhams.
The motion was adopted.
Dr. Rader opened the evening session
with the customary prayer. The minutes
of the afternoon session were read and
approved. On the motion of Mr. Wood
hams the moderator was instructed to
administer the oath to witnesses.
Mr. Woodhams then again defined his
position in the investigation disclaiming
all intention of partiality or bias and ask
ing for a suspension of judgment by any
who might think he at any time acted
otherwise than impartially.
Dr. Brown raised the question of classi
fying the charges so as to have all those
relating to different individuals treated
separately, but he was overruled by Mr.
Woodhams, who stated that all witnesses
would be asked to testify to everything
they new in connection with any of the
charges or persons mentioned in them.
This matter being settled Mr. Wood
hams announced he was ready to go on by
producing as a witness Mrs. Sarah B.
Cooper.
'â¢She has prepared," he said, "a state
ment on the matter which she wishes to
read without interruption, after which
she is willing to be examined by whoever
wishes to do so."
Mrs. Cooper ascended the platform and
prepared to read her statement, when Dr.
Brown asked that she be sworn. She then
took the following oath :
You solemnly promise in the presence of the
omniscient and heart-searching God that you
will declare the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, according to the best of
your knowledge, in the matter in which you
are colled as a witness and respecting 'the
guilt or innocence of the Rev. Charles o.
Brown, D.D., upon the charges before this
council as you shall answer it to the great
judge of the quick and the dead.
Dr. Brown then asked : "Am I to under
stand that I am to be debarred, if the mat
ter prove irrelevant, from my privilege as
a defendant? Am I to sit here and be
compelled to listen, possibly for an hour,
to matters irrelevant?"
Moderator McLean informed Dr. Brown
that Mrs. Cooper would be allowed to
read her paper without interruption and
that other witnesses should be allowed to
do the same. Mrs. Cooper read as follows :
Gentlemen of the Council: As preliminary to
the main statement which I have to make, I
desire to say, that whatever I have said or
done and whatever 1 may say or do, in regard
to this unhappy affair has "been inspired by
one single motive, aud that is, to get at the
essential truth oi the matter in question,
namely, the guilt or innocence of Rev. Dr.
C. O. Brown, as respects the grave rumors (I
will not say charges) that have been and are
current against him.
That my earnestness in this matter to get at
the truth was inspired Dy no previous prejudice
or aversion to Dr. Brown, I solemnly affirm.
In support of this affirmation I challenge any
one to truthfully testify to a single disloyal
word or act on my own part, from the earliest
date of his ministry up to the time of the pub
lication of the Overman letters in the Ex
aminer of January 2of the present year. On
the contrary, I call to rerrembrance my many
public utterances, at the meetings of the Bay
Association and at the social festivals of the
church, such as Forefathers' day and the like,
where I have, in response to toasts and other
wise, uttered the strongest words in commen
dation of Dr. Brown's zeal and labors in behalf
of the church.
I desire, also, to refer to my weekly reports
of Dr. brown's sermons in the Bulletin, in all
of which I have shown myself, by the printed
and published records, from the earliest date
of his pastorate, August 14, 1892, up to the
date of the publication of the Overman let
ters, to have been his loyal friend and sun
porter. Many who did not like Dr. Brown's
pulpit ministrations will bear me witness that
they have asked me not to report his sermons
on the ground that it tended to strengthen his
ministry, and they desired him to resign I
invariably replied that I believed it to be the
duty of every church member to work to build
up the church. I always argued with them
that when we united with the church we
pledged our vows to seek the highest good of
the church; that pastors were local and transi
tory, but that the church of God was univer
sal and permanent. I have been the stanch
friend and defender of Dr. Brown in his min
istry and work to scores who have not liked
him personally or in the pulpit. This is well
known to many who are here present and to
scores of others who would bear witness to the
truth of what I here affirm.
In support of this statement I would say that
on Sunday evening, July 21st, of last year, in
response 19 an invitation from Dr. Brown, I
spoke in his pulpit on "The Religious Train
ing of Children." The church was filled,
many strangers being present. In introducing
me Dr. Brown characterized me as "Assistant
Pastor," to which kind allusion I craclously
demurred, at the same time admitting that 1
desired to do all in my power to aid him in
church work. This shows the true state of
feeling as it existed up to January of the pres
ent year. I do not remember to have ever
been refused a favor by Dr. Brown, except
when 1 endeavored to secure the church for
the opening meeting for one of the congresses,
the Religious Congress, when Dr. Brown ob
jected to having a Jewish rabbi in his pulpit.
I remarked pleasantly that our Master used to
go into the synagogue to teach on the Sabbatli
day. The trustees and deacons were all de
sirous for the congress to have the church.
That was but a passing matter, ana I never
gave it another thought.
I deem it necessary to say this at the start
in order to show clearly that what I have said
or done, or what I may hereafter fay or do, is
entirely free from personal prejudice, or pre
conceived notions or opinions in regard to Dr.
Brown; and that it is done only in the inter
est of purity, truth and righteousness. Any
one who knows, or thinks he knows, of dire
contagion, whether physical or moral, in the
community, or in the church, and does not
do his utmost to prevent its propagation, is, in
truth, responsible for the result that may
ensue. To conceal anything bearing upon a
case like this where the best intcrsts of society
are involved is to lie an abettor and coadjutor;
or, to use a legal phrase, is to be accessory be
fore the fact.
What it has cost me of anguish and suffering
to take the steps I have taken, God alone knows.
I saw Gethsemane before me, but 1 dared not
shrink from it. With deep humility aiul great j
pain I quote the words of the Master whom I i
seek to serve: "The cup which my Father hath
given me, shall I not drink it?"
And now, trusting to the eternal strength
and in the ultimate triumph of truth and
righteousness, 1 take up trie plain, simple
statement of facts and incidents as they have
been unfolded to me since the beginning of
this sad affair.
On the morning of Sunday, December 29, I i
was startled and astonished by the publication j
of a terrible scandal concerning our pastor,
Dr. Brown. Loving the church as I do, next j
to my home, I felt as if my own home had
been assailed.
At the close of the morning service, just be
fore I opened my Bible, class, I extended my
hand to Dr. Brown and assured him of my
earnest sympathy, mv perfect confidence in
his integrity, and of my unqualified support in
this fearful attack upou his character, which I j
felt sure was born of malignity and evil. Hoi
thanked me heartily and ssid : "Sister Cooper, i
the blush of shame shall never be brought to I
your cheek by anything which I have !
done." The utterance seemed to me to be i
heartfelt and sincere. I have often been called j
a born advocate. I certainly nm a true and j
loyal defender of my friends, and of those
whom I believe to be misjudged and abused.
Not satisfied with my verbal expression of !
sympathy and proffer of help in the afternoon, I
after having completed my report of Dr. '
Brown's sermon for publication, I wrote him a i
letter lull ol encouragement, bidding him be
brave and hopeful, reminding him of the
worus of the poet-philosopher:
For right is right, since God is God,
And right the day will win,
To doubt, would be disloyalty,
To falter would be siu.
This letter I directed to his 1 home address,
1703 Geary street, my daughter consulting the
telephone directory to make sure of the num- !
ber. My diary confirms these facts. I mention
this fact in connection with this matter be
cause Dr. Brown reproached me publicly on
the platform on the evening I made my pro
test for never having written him on the sub
ject. This protest was made aguinst the adop
tion of the resolution of confidence in his
integrity, after asking for a suspension of
judgment, which I then characterized as a
logical absurdity, and which position I still I
maintain.
But to return to the chronological order of
incidents. Bear in mind that this letter oi
mine to Dr. Brown, wherein I expressed confi
dence in his innocence, was written on Decem
ber 29, the last i-unday of the year. I proffered
my sympathy and any service I could render
Four days later, on Thursday morning Jan
uary 2, the Examiner published the first in
stallment of the Overman letters. And it was
just at this point that my confidence in the
integrity of Dr. Brown began to falter. And
why? Because a fac-simile letter of Miss Over
man's, published in that paper, was in the
exact chirography of letters which Miss Over
man had written to our Normal Kindergarten
trainer and to me in regard to en'eriug the
normal training class for kindergartners
Striking peculiarities in orthographv and
syntax, in the use and non-use of capitals, and
many other distinctive characteristics con
vinced me that the letters came from the same
hand. My faith in Dr. Brown's integrity was
somewhat shaken, but I still hoped tlia't the
darkness might give place to dawn.
On Sunday, January 5, Dr. Brown did not
preach. Protessor Lloyd occupied the pulpit.
I reported the sermon, as usual, and after com
pleting it I again wrote to Dr. Brown. I could
not speak as cheerily as in my former lettor,
but I wrote as strongly as I could. I said it
was right to apprehend a blackmailer, but I
asked him why he did not take the precaution
to have an officer of the law secreted in his
study and then draw out Mrs. Davidson's state
ment from her, pay her the money, give her a
receipt, and at that point have the officer take
her into custody? "In that way," I added,
"you would have protected the church, your
self and saved great pain to all your friends."

YESTERDAY I CONVERSED WITH
â *- Mr. J. M. Clifford, of 265 S. Main street,
Los Angeles, California. He is one of the
leading merchants of Los Angeles, and is a
gentleman of strict integrity and high
aims. He told me much about the city of
Los Angeles," its boom, its collapse, its
steady growth and its now thriving import-
ance. Then he spoke of Joy'a Vegetable
Sarsaparilla. Said he:
"I have no hesitation in indorsing Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla. I believe it is a
very fine spring medicine. The early spring
has caught many men and women unpre-
pared, and there is much lassitude and dull
feeling. One can't always be just well, so
one needs a spring medicine to tone up and
cleanse the system. I have used Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla to my great advan-
tage. Before using the remedy I felt out
of sorts, blue. I was not a sick man, yet I
did not feel as rugged as I desired. Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla has its advantage
over other spring medicines in that it con-
tains only herbs. There being no minerals
in this remedy, one does not have to show
its effect in facial blemishes, blood spots
and Sarsaparilla trademarks. If you take
the remedy you will soon begin to realize
its importance. â¢ Again its action on the
bowels is simply remarkable. There are
nogriping pains, no nauseating feelings to
go through. Yes, I recommend Joy's Veg-
etable Sarsaparilla." â â  V
The experience of this Los Angeles mer-
chant is the experience of hundreds of men
and women who have use 1 Joy's Vegeta-
ble Sarsaparilla. Many people are at first
averse to using Joy's Vegetable Sarsapa-
rf ila, but wnen they once try the grand
herb remedy, they invariably recommend
it to their friends and even chance ac-
quaintances.
The people of the Pacific Coast are now
alive to the substitution business. There
are still a few druggists trying to palm off
something "just as good," but ] you don't
have to take the "just as good," you can get
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla, if you insist.

Yet behind the dread unknown
Standeth God within the shadow
Keeping watch above his- own.
My confidence has been shaken, but not de
stroyed. From this letter, to which my diary
of that date besrs record. I received no reply.
Next came the publication of further letters
from Miss Overman to Mrs. Tunnell. These
i letters were dated from early in June, 1895, to
August Iâ covering two months. And it was
these letters that still farther shook my confi
dence in Dr. Brown. In every one of these let
ters, save that of July 24, -Miss Overman writes
! of the kindergarten, of her desire to hear from
our normal trainer. Miss Storall, and lroni me,
and of her having been accepted for training.
She says In her letter of August 1 : "Yesterday
I received a letter from Miss Stovall informing
me that the position of assistant teacher was
still open for me in the school supported by
the First Congregational Church. Strange,"
adds Miss Overman, "that she should have so
placed me."' Miss Overman further wrote that
Miss Stovall spoke of Dr. 8., and that ''he very
highly recommended my moral character.
Very kind of him, don t you think?" she sar
castically adds.
On making inquiry of Miss Stovall, our nor
mal trainer, she informed me that she had
asked Dr. Brown for credentials, according to
Miss Overman's suggestion, and that he had
refilled to her question in a somewhat curt and
hasty manner, as if annoyed, in the words,
"Above reproachâ above reproach," leaving
the impression upon Miss Stovall's mind that
he did not care to have Miss Overman take the
kindergarten course of training. Thus you
will see that every fact and circumstance in
the Overman letters regarding the kinder
garten, as published in the Kxaminer, corre
sponds exactly with the facts and circum
stances as they occurred in our experience
with Miss Overman. It is, therefore, neither
unjust nor illogical to infer that other facts
ano circumstances contained in the Overman
letters might have a basic foundation in fact.
At all events, by the laws of evidence, such a
conclusion cannot be called un-Christian or
unkind. lam certain those letters are gen
uine, and, being genuine, I cannot see how Dr.
Brown can be a man of integrity.
The publication of the Overman letters, with
so much in them relating to the plan for her
kindergarten training, naturally turned the
tnought of the daily press toward me for in
formation, and from that time to the present I
have not been forgotten by my friends of the
press. And I will say just here that in all the
numerous interviews in the search after news
1 do not know of a single instance in which I
have been {incorrectly reported. It has been
my experieuce that a polite and sincere treat
ment of the representatives of the press has
been met with a corresponding polite and sin
cere treatment on the part of the press.
There was one expression which I made in
gfeat earnestness. "Oh, why does he not con
fess?" which leaped to my lips unbidden at a
fresh revelation of details and of incidents tnat
fairly overwhelmed me with their corrobora
tive strength and confirmation. I felt that a
full and honest confession was the only road
to peace. David sinned deeply, but lie con
fessed and was forgiven, and some of his
noblest work was done after his great sin and
confession. Peter denied his Lord, but he was
forgiven because of his penitence. And, feel
ing as I did, that Dr. Brown might have gone
wrong, I longed to have him confess and
repent, knowing that "he that covereth his sins
shall not prosper; but whoso confesseth and
forsaketh them shall have mercy." "If we
confess our sins he is faithful and just to for
give us our sins, and to cleanse us from all un
righteousness." This was why I cried out,
"Why does he not confess?" f felt that it was
the only road to peace.
Then came a deluge of letters of all sorts and
kinds. From December 29 to the present time
I have received over 450 letters. Some of
them were strongly confirmatory in character.
As for example, one was from a clergyman
who said ihat he had been in the ministry for
nearly forty years. From his lengthy letter oÂ£
about six pages I quote the following: "I am
acquainted with a Christian lady who knew of
their (Dr. Brown's and Miss Overman's) rela
tions in 1894. and warned Miss Overman and
Mrs. Tunnell of the storm that would inevita
bly break, upon them in the future. One of the
strongest links in the chain of evidence," con
tinues the writer, "is the hasty flight of Mrs.
Tunnell, who knew more of Miss Overman's
secrets and life than any one else. She had no
reason of her own for going. She must have
disappeared in the interest of one or more who
desire to get her out of reach of both tne civil
and ecclesiastical courts." The name of the

protest against the "resolution of confidence
in the integrity of Dr. Brown" which was to be
offered at the meeting that (Wednesday) even
ing. "hen the resolution was offered'l signi
nea to the chairman my desire to speak on the
resolution. 1 spoke as follows :
During the past weeksâ sacl woeks, indeedâ l
Have been asked many times whnt I thought in re
uam to Dr. Browji occupying the pulpit, pending
the investigation of the grave charges that huve
tit-.n madfe against him. My invariable reply has
been tha'. I should not think "he would desire to do
bo, knowing as he must know, the divided stut:
meut of the church in regard to the matter.
i have also l>eeu overwhelmed with questions
along other lines of this sad affair, when have
rained me beyond expression. Scores ot letters
ironi all over the country have reached me laden
w-ith Inquiries, showing how fast and far sad tid
lnps can travel.
It is easy to make answer at long ranse by
say:ncr. ".Let us wait and see wliu: is the essential
truth:"
And just here I must be permitted to state why
my mind and hean have been rent with con
fucting emotions durins all this sad interval.
Wbenthe sad disc osures first appeared, on the
morning of December 29, 1 lelt tl:ut malignity and
crime had clasped hands in a nefarious effort to
ruin the fair name the pastor of tl>is church.
1 entervd my protest to members of the press,
with which I have been long connected, character
izing the charges made aeiinst Dr. Rrown as in
tar.io.is and (rue!. I was told, in r>-.spons", that
evidence of the most convincing nature was In the
hands of the editors. Even this did not shake my
laith, nntU I saw the published letters of JMlss
Overman in the ! umlner of January 2.
These, I must confess, staggered my faith, and
cus: a deep shadow over my heart. " Whv? . Be
cause the entire recital tu inose published letters
concerning the application of Miss Overman to
v nter the Golden Gate Klndergarteu Normal Train
ing Stbool corresponded exactly in respect to dates
ami of facts to the written letters received from
Miss Overman by me mid by our normal trainer,
Jliss Anna Stovall, in regard to the matter la ques
tion.
Heferences to my diary, where I keep the
ri-cords concerning our work, are confirmatory of
the same dates and facts-
Then, again, when a fac simile of Miss Over
nian's letters appeared in the Kxaminerof Janu
ary . sii.l January 7 the chirography was found to
be identical. Striking peculiarities and id osyn
crasies .u the matter of orthography and of syntax
were unmistakable and convincing. There was no
escaping the conviction that the letters were from
t:.e sarue personâ written by the same hand.
With such iticoutroverubie evidence of the
cennineness of the Overman letters in my own
hands, together with much corroborative * test i
mony oi which I will not now speak, Is it to be
wondered at that I have felt an irrepressible de
sire to have a satisfactory explanation regarding
the Overman letters, which 1 am frank to confess
nave caused me unspeakable pain and havese ved
to unsettle my hitherto implici: confidence in a
pastor 10 whom I have always given my loyal al
!^g:ance and unfaltering support? -"Â» -.=-
â¢In view of all these puzzling' ; circumstances I
should be personally glad If our pastor could feel
it to be wise and best to refrain from preaching
until such time as he may be legally permitted to
explain all these perplexing problems, and thus
make the dark places radiant with "the light of
truth and righteousness, for this X fervently hope
a tid pray.
These remarks have been characterized by
some of the friends of Dr. Brown as un
womanly, unchristian, and by many other
ephithets not used in polite society. I really
do not see that-they deserve such severe cen
fcure. It seems to me that they are temperate,
calm and logical. However they must speak
for themselves. During their presentation Dr.
Brown, who was on the platform, interrupted
me with the question: "Are you aware that
you are laying yourself open to church disci
pline?" 1 replied that I was aware of it and
continued to read the protest. Then followed
hisses from different parts of the audience, the
Bon of Dr. Brown, who sat on the piano-stool
near me, joining in the hissing. There was no
word of rvbuke from Dr. Brown, who sat close
by me. The chairman. Deacon- Dexter, pro
tested from the platform. I paid little atten
tion to the insult, simply remarking that there
was oi.e creature besides man that could hiss.
I should have said there were two. Later ex
periences in this sad affair have brought to
mind the second.
It is hard for me to account fnr the venom
that has been manifested in this affair; tnalig
nity is not argument; it cannot change a
Eingle fact. Just after I had finished my pro
test Dr. Brown said: "Mrs. Cooper would have
received the explanation she demands if she
had come to my home. There, at any time, I
will give her an absoluteexplanation of all she
afks. I will convince her of my innocence,
and ask only her word to keep silent until I
am allowed to speak." .
J immediately arose and said: "Then I will
be at your home at 10 o'clock to-morrow
morning."
'Make it 11 o'clock," returned Dr. Brown.
I said: "Any hour." "But 11 o'clock will suit
mo better." "I shall be there," lat once re
plied.
The next morning, just as I was about to
Etart for Dr. Brown's residence, I received a
telephone message from him informing me
that he could not see me, as Judge Louderback
was very angry with him lor even proposing
btich a thing.
Of course I did not go, and I had no feeling
in the matter, as the otter had come volun
tarily from Dr. Brown himself, at the meeting
the night previous.
At a subsequent meeting, held one week
from that time, my daughter was character
ized by one of Dr. Brown's ardent followers
as "a smallpox speckled-face creature," and
was told she had better ieave the room. Ij
mention this to show the deep-seated malignity
which manifested itself in some of the adher
ents of I>r. Brown. Nomine in ail this bitter
experience has been so hard for me to bear
as this public insult to my daughter, for rea
sons which I stated to the press the following
day. They are as follows:
Mrs. Doriey Szanik. who, by the way. Is a mem
hor of the First Church, insulted others as well as
i.-s ' oojitr. Tljjs insult hurt Mrs. Cooper deeply.
â¢ It maae It all the harrier lo bear." she said,
"when I remembered what hroiiKl t this sorrow to
oar home. It whs during the lust year of the war,
In 18t>5, when the.Un.on refugees were flockins
Into Memphis. 1 was president of h society in
that city lor the protection of refugees, nd snp
j>Hes of clothing, food and money were aeot to me
for distribution. A poor woman liud come over
from Arkaiuas In an oxcart, with seven little
children. Her husband, a Union man, was
l.ldiug out to cet away from the bushwhackers, as
they were called. Bbe was utterly destitute, and
< .iti'i â¢ to me lor help, fllint; me all her seven chil
dren were (Jown wi:h the measles. It proved to bÂ«
imallpox, and although my darling rhildreu lmd
tÂ«en vaccinated the year before, they were both at
tacked with the dire disease, our baauUfu] little
Mary diedâ there is her picture now â and precli us
â¢Jattie was spared to us, the last of four children.
T;i^ is the first time that u cru< 1 taunt has ever
rr bÂ«Â£ her, and It was in my <rwn church and by a
church lÂ»eaÂ»ber. It Is the hardest of all the hard
things 1 have Sad to bear in this sad, dreadful case.
This is Â»H I -an Â«ay. I know Of DOthius more
cruel. It shows tlib >-irit of some of theadheriiiis
of Vr. Brown."
But, after all, I bellev? that a good Provi
dence was in it all, as the climax of this state
ment ill show. On the enduing- morning,
Thursday, February (i, about c o'clock, the
telephone rang, anil in response KÂ« the call
came the following question irom the other
en i of the line:
"iMrs. Cooper, will you let me come and see
>â "â .â .â¢ It is Mrs. Stockton who is speaking."
J told her I should' be glad to t.ee her, and in
the ooam of an hour Mrs. Stockton was seated
In lily library v.ith my daughter and myself.
As soon as she was seated, with much evi
dent OtlOO â  .â â¢ said: 'Mrs. Cooper, I can
Ktand it no longer to see you abused and vili
fied by one wiiom 1 know is the det-pest-dyeU
hypocrite in San FroncJsco. I wrote you a
'fetter last week and then tore it up ; but, after
thu abuse of last night, I can stand it no
longer. He is a vile hypocrite."
1 interposed the question, "Do you know Dr.
wcnvn to be r bad inuti?" placing strong ein
pliasis on the word ''know." |
"Indeed J d<>," replied Mrs. Stockton, "and
he knows that I know all about him."
'Do ; on. wish to tell me what you know?" I
asked. " i
v. es> " ? he re P lied . l<l came to tell you. I
WlaototeU you because he is so cruel to you
"iia you have always tried to be a friend to
me.
"Dr. Brown," continued Mrs. Stockton, "fol
lowed me persistently while I was in the Sur
veyor s olhce; I found him waiting for me dav
after day in the corridors. The first thing 'l
knew, there would be Dr. Brown. He would
ask me to take a ride with him on the cars or
to go with him somewhere, until his constant
attention was observed by a friend one day
who asked me who he was, I baid ,'lt is Dr.
Brown.'"
Mrs. Stockton entered into full details, which
l will not embody in this statement. They
were of such a character as to convince me
that Dr. Brown should not occupy the pulpit
until a thorough investigation had been insti
tuted and his innocence established beyoud a
douot.
This interview with Mrs. .Stockton lasted
nearly two hours, my daughter being present
all ot the time. During the interview Mrs.
Stockton told me that when she joined ihe
church it was with asinceredesire to be helped
to live a Christian life. With real pathos she
referred to her 1 ittle daughter and said: "I
want to raise my little girl to do right. I love
my little girl and I want her to be good."
Here Mrs. Stockton burst into tears and trem
blod with emotion.
I then said: "I cannot ask you to go with me
before the council and testify. It would be
asking too much..'
Mrs. Stockton replied: "I think I ought to go,
and if you will let me go with you and your
daughter 1 will go and tell them what 1 know
of Dr. Brown."
I pointed out all of the difliculties that she
would have to encounter, but they did not
seem to shake her purpose. She left me with
the avowed wish of going with me to the
council.
1 do not hesitate to say that I believe that
Mrs. Stockton was moved by the Spirit of God
to come to me on that morning, fehe was, I
believe, moved by that same Spirit of ood the
wt-ek betore to write me a letter, which she
did, and, resisting the Spirit, she afterward de
m royed it. But again tne might;, Spirit of (jod
moved her to come and tell me the truth.
Toward the close of the interview Mrs. Stock
ton said: "1 was never so happy as when 1 was
teaching in the kindergarten under your direc
tion. I loved the wore. I loved the little
cnildren and I was happy."
And right here I desire to say that the judg
ment of the world in regard to women is in
sharp and bitter contrast with the judgments
in regard to men. It is all wrons;. And I
further wish to say that 1 stand ready to help
all women who desire to iive a pure and good
life. 1 would forever help them and never
hinder them.
\Vhen I told Dr. Brown, as my minister, in
the sacred confidence mat pertains to that
holy calling, or that should pertain to it, of
the Port Angeles letters which referred to Mrs.
Stockton's unpaid bills in that place, and
when I further suggested that she might be
somewhat gay in demeanor. Dr. Brown ac once
Hiked, "Do you think I have compromised my-
Bell?" I replied, "Oh, no; you are her liiini's
ter, and your motives could not be called into
question." Dr. Brown responded, "But 1 have
been to see her when she was ill and have re
mained for some time, hearing her troubles
and trying to comfort her." I again assured
him that no one could question his motives.
I further stated to him that I had seen both
Mrs. Brown and himself getting on the street
car with Mrs,. Stockton, and mentioned some
nymg rumors, concerning the truth of which
I knew nothing. All that I said was in the
spirit of Christian kindness to all concerned.
i Hore the matter ended, i have never spoken
oi Mrs. Stockton to Dr. or Mrs. Brown from
that time to this, except in response to Mrs.
Brown's paper on the evening of Wednesday,
Jreoruary 5, when she charged me with break
ing up her home by introducing Mrs. Stockton
to Dr. Brown, with all the consequences thai
followed.
It seems to me that such a charge as this is
very unjust. Certainly a minister of the Gos
pel should be one to whom the members of his
church can confidently introduce any and nil
who seek direction anil guidance. A minister's
primal mission is to seek to lead the weak and
wandering ones Dack into the paths of pleas
antr.Â»ss and peace. A minister s highest vo
cation is. or should be. to seek tne prodigals
and tne wanderers and to Dring them back to
the Father's home. That is what Jesus did,
and no scandal ever attached itself to his de>ir
name in doing this. A minister's character
should be so granitelike in quality, and yet so
kind, as to enable him to minister, as Christ
did, to any and to all who need his ministra
tions. Sinners need it most of all.
Not the righteous, not the righteous,
dinners Jesus came to call.
All ministers and all Christians should be
able to say (to some extent, at least), as did
Jesus, the master, â¢'The Prince of this world
cometh and hatn nothing in me." iience. it,
seems to me that any minister who censures
another for introducing the weak and wander
ing ones confesses thereby that he is not fitted
for the sacred restorative and puri/y ing work
of those who are called of Ciod to go forth to
seek and to save that which was lost; to be min
isters of Christ to any and all who need them.
lience, I say again, a minister's chief con
cern should be to reach out after the wanderers,
no matter how far they have wandered, and
he should be morally and spiritually strong
enough to donhe work.
Paul tells the story of what a preacher should
be iÂ« his letter to Timotny. He says: "He
must have a good report of them which are
without." This we have a right to desire and
to demand.
The foregoing part of this statement was
flnisoed ar.d placed in the hands, of a type
writer on Saturday morning. February 15. Ou
the evening of Monday, February 17 Mrs.
Stockton spent the evening in my home, tell
ing me, in the presence of my legal adviser, of
the terrible pressure that had been brought to
bear upon her to prevent her from appearing
before this council and testifying against Dr.
Brown. She was told that he' (Dr. Brown)
would put her behind prison bars if she testi
fied. She said: "I would end my life t>efore I
wbuid go to prison." My attorney assured her
that this was only the same style of intimida
tion that had been pract ; ced upon those who
were to testify against Dr. Brown. She said:
"1 long to go before that council and to tell all
I know of that dreadful man."
Just as she left my door, she said: "Mrs.
Cooper. I am determined to do what is right,
I will go to the council and testify in spite of
all the threats of imprisonment that have
been made."
I wish to recall the fact to the minds of the
council that Mrs. Stoctton came to me from
the first of her own free will. She soueht the
interview because she felt she ought to do It.
And now I close this statement. 1 have
spoken plainly. I could not do otherwise. 1
have set down naught in malice. I have done
only that which 1 was compelled to do by my
conscience and my sense of duty. God's voice
was mandatory within me. Idared not dis
obey, no matter what I might be called upon
to suffer. To have faltered would have been
sin. There are two places in this great whirl
ing world that shouli be held sacred. No pro
fane liana should ever be laid upon themâ the
home and the church. The chureh wnere we
take our little ones to dedicate them to God;
the church where our fair, pure young
brides pledge their sacred vows;* the
church from which we carry forth our
beloved dead to their last restiiig-place: the
church where we group to hear of Him who is
the way, the truth and the life; the church
where we pledge ourselves to seek Its peace
and prosperity. In doing what I have done I
have endeavored to seek its peace and pros
perity by seeking its purity. First pure, then
peaceableâ this is the divine order. I have
done my duty. I have no further responsibil
ity in the matter.
Gentlemen of the council and reverend sirs,
the responsibility now rests with you. May
the God whom we seek- to serve direct us all
with that wisdom which is from above.
Having finished her statement. Mrs.
Cooper was asked to be seated in the wit
ness-chair, in order that she might be ex
amined and cross-examined on her state
ment.
Woodhamsâ l now introduce as evidence the
letter referred to in the statement of Mrs.
Cooper. Mrs. Cooper, who was that letter
from?
Mrs. Cooperâ From Rev. Mr. Coplin.
Did that letter come to jou under cover of
the United States mail?
It did.
The letter was shown to the witness and
she identified it, and Dr. Brown was also
allowed to examine it.
Woodhamsâ lf Dr. Brown has any motion to
make to strike out any portion of this state
ment that he thinks ought not to go in he can
make it now.
iirownâ l would take pleasure in being sworn
right now and in dc-ny ing rII the allegations in
that paper. I would like that portion that re
fers to the personal insult to Miss Cooper
stricken out. It has not the slightest
bearing on the case. Mtss Cooper, ou that
same night, called my wife a liar, trie first time
hhe had ever had such a term applied to her,
and that oueht to go in if such matters aTe to
be considered, but I don't think they ought to
be. I say again, that I would be pleased at
this time to deny every allegation in that
paper.
Woodhamsâ lt had been mentioned to me
that certain matters that appear irrelevant
would be in the paper, but I was told that they
were used to show the motive for certain ac
tions, such as what induced Mrs. Stockton to
cali C^^Mrs. Cooper. 1 think the whole paper
should .TT made a part of the record, as it can
be considered later.
Mr. Woodharas 1 suggestion was adopted.
Woodhams (to witness)â Did you ever receive
any communication from Miss Overmnn?
Mrs. Cooperâ l received the letters referred
to in my statement.
Woodhams (showing witness a letter)â ls this
a letter you rect- ived from Miss Overman?
Mrs. Cooperâ My trainer received it from her
and it was given to me.
Woodhamsâ l file this letter, Mr. Moderator;
that it may be used for tiie purpose of com
paring handwriting at some future time.
Hie letter was submitted to Dr. Brown,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1896.
who passed it to Miss Overman. The lat
ter inspected it and returned it to Dr.
Brown, who informed Mr. Woodhams and
the council that Miss Overman admitted
that the letter had been written by her.
Pondâ Mrs. Cooper, will Mrs. Stockton ap
pear before the council and give her testi
mony?
Mrs. Cooperâ l hope that she will, and I have
reason to believe that she will.
Parkinsonâ Who was it that told you, or did
any one tell you, that he saw Mrs. Tunnell
escape out of the back door of Dr. Brown's
residence?
Mrs. Cooperâ They did not say that they saw
it. A reporter told me so. Ido net know* who
saw it.
l'ftrkinsonâ Was it Dr. Brown who applied
that epithet to your daughter?
Mrs. Cooperâ lt was Mrs. Szanik.
Parkinsonâ Did Mrs. Stockton say she went
on these excursions, to which she says she was
invited by Dr. Brown?
Mrs. Cooperâ Yes, sir.
Parkinsonâ Did Mrs. Stockton, Dr. Brown
and Mrs. Brown all pet on the streetcar to
gether at the time referred to in your state
ment?
Mrs. Cooperâ All three got on toeether.
Parkinsonâ Who tried to intimidate Mrs.
Stockton? Dr. Brown?
Mrs. Cooperâ l decline to answer.
Tenncyâ Did you read the original letters to
Mrs. Junnell, and were you able to compare
them with the letters you had from Miss Over
man?
Mrs. Cooperâ I have never seen her letters,
except those I received and hold from Miss
Overman.
Tvnneyâ Could not a fac-sirnile of her writ
ing have been made by using original letters?
I mean could not these letters have been fab
ricated?
Mrs. Cooperâ The facts mentioned in those
letters, their chirography and their style con
\inoeil me of iheir genuineness. I do not
think they could have been manufactured.
Si nk â A reporter told you about Mrs. Tun
nell bei"ng let out of the side door of Dr
Brown's house. Is it possible for the council
to secure the reporter as a witness.
Brownâ The defense would also like to call
mm, principally because I have no side or
back door to my house. [Laughter in the
audience.]
Mrs. Coonerâ l believe I said entrance.
lirownâ There is no side or back entrance.
On the request of one of the members of
the council Mrs. Cooper agreed to make
excerpts from her diary to substantiate
certain statements in her paper.
Sinkâ Will you give the name of this reporter
to Mr. Woodhams?
Mrs. Cooper agreed to do this and wrote
it on a slip of paper for Mr. Woodhams.
Sinkâ Were the matters contained in Miss
Overman's letters to you and Mrs. Tunuell
known generally?
Mrs. Cooperâ They were known only to mv
self, the trainer of the kindergarten teachers
and my daughter.
Parkinsonâ Will Mrs. Cooper give us the
name of the person who tried to intimidate
Mrs. .Stockton?
Mrs. Cooperâ l would prefer to have Mrs.
Stockton tell that name.
Woodhamsâ lf Mrs. Stockton should not tes
tify before this council would you be willing to
give that name?
Mrs. Cooperâ l would like to consult my at
torney, who was present during all the time
Mrs. Stockton told her story.
Tcnneyâ lf Mrs. Stockton is not willing to
testily are you willing to testify to what she
told you?
McLeanâ The council may not wish to hear
it. That is a question that should be settled
by the councilâ as to whether such testimony
is wanted.
Tenueyâ We want facts. We haven't many
yet. *
Mrs. Cooperâ lam perfectly willing to give
those facts to the council, but not to an audi
ence.
Woodhamsâ Can you turn to vour diary in
which the excerpts are which" confirm vour
statement?
Brownâ l may save some time by admitting
as true all that the diary explains. I never
denied having received the first letter. The
secona letter I knew nothing of until I re
turned to my home on the evening of February
5. when my wife informed me that she had
read it and considered it insulting and de
stroyed it. I understand that witnesses are to
be brought to prove the allegations in this
statement. I do not understand that we have
any proof before us.
Dr. Brown then asked Mrs. Cooper if
she had not seen the report of the council
which had investigated the Rochester
matter, and she replied that she had, but
did not think that councils could always
be depended upon to find against minis
ters from a desire not to deprive them of
their means of livelihood. But she quali
fied her statement by saying she had com
plete confidence in the existing council.
In response to questions by the accused
pastor she stated she was a3 positive his
son, when he hissed at her, sat near the
piano as she was of anything she averred.
Brownâ Have you any objection to stating
what those flying rumors are you referred to
about Mrs. Stockton?
Mrs. Cooper â I think that those things
should be held sacred.
Brownâ Do you think it proper for me to
hold sacred what Is used against me by your
self?
Mrs. Cooperâ l do not see now it has anything
to do with this matter. I decline to give the
name.
It was some little time before Mrs.
Cooper could be made to understand the
question of Dr. Brown, but she finallv
comprehended it and answered that a
ministerial confidence ought never to be
violated.
Replying to a question by Mr. Wood
hams Mrs. Coocer said that the menace to
Mrs. Stockton came through Dr. Brown
and that she would give the name to the
council, but not to the public. This offer
was accepted. She also promised to give
to the council the name of the person who
told her that Dr. Brown hung around the
corridors of the Surveyor-General's build
ing.
Chairman Hoyt of the committee on
charges announced that it would hold a
meeting for the presentation of further
charges or information concerning Dr.
Brown in the pastor's office to-day at 130
P. M.
The council then adjourned to a secret
session, at which it was determined to
limit future statements to a mere matter
of questions and answers. A possible
exception will be made in the case of Miss
Overman, whom the council think is en
titled to the same courtesy extended to
Mrs. Cooper.
Adjournment was taken until 2 p m to
day.
WALKING THE CARPET.
Two Policemen Fined by the Board of
Police Commissionors Last
Evening.
Policeman W. D. Scott was fined f 100 by
the Board of Police Commissioners last
night for having made a false charge
against Henry Meyer, a groceryman at the
corner of Polk and Grove streets. Meyer
applied for a liquor license, and upon
Scott's representation it was refused. Upon
examination before the board the police
man's charges were not proven.
Policeman Henry A. Madden v was fined
$25 for being absent from his beat, near the
foot of Townsend street. He stated that
he was investigating a call for the police,
but the Commissioners concluded that his
investigations, lasting one hour and twenty
minutes, were too long, and his next
month's salary was clipped.
The McLaughlm case went over till next
Wednesday.
Wliat Makes Conduct Right?
Professor William Henry Hudson of the Ene-
lish department of Stanford University spoke
last night In the hall of the Academy of
Sciences upon the '"Social Aspects of Conduct."
It was the second'of a series of popular lectures
given by the Stanford University Extension
Club. The discussion was mainly upon what
constitutes rightaction and what innkes certain
conduct wrong, and the conclusion was that
moral conduct is that which makes more hap
piness or lesg misery in the world. The speaker
said that at present people do not make a clear
distinction between what is right because it is
morally so, and what is considered right be
cause of some religious command, some social
custom or some legal declaration. The theo
logical, the social and the legal standard of
right is not based upon the idea that certain
conduct is right because it is moral, but simply
because the standard prescribes it. So it was
originally with the theological sanction for
conduct. The code arose from the personal
mandates of some ancestor or chief that in
lime came to be regarded as supernatural pre
cepts. What was commanded to be done whs
considered right; what was forbidden was
wrong.

A LABOR AMALGAMATION.
Local Unions May Adopt the Plan
of the Western Labor
Council.
NOW FOR THE SWEATSHOPS.
A Crusade to Be Begun Soon Against
Those Who Make Use of
1 Child Labor.
At the meeting of the Labor Union con
vention last Tuesday. R. T. Mclvor of the
Painters' and Decorators' Union Intro
duced a long resolution from the commit
tee on resolutions and asked that it be
adopted as the platform or declaration of
principles of the convention. It provoked
much discussion and it was finally referred
to a committee, consisting of one delegate
from each union, which was directed to
arrange a platform and resolution and to
formulate a plan for the permanent organ
ization of the new federation.
This committee has not been idle. Its
members have Deen hard at work discuss
ing various forms of organization, and
particularly how all interests can be har
monized so that all will work for a com
mon purpose.
This matter was brought up last night
at the meeting of the American Railway
Union. For the first time since the late
strike the members of this organization
have kept out of sight and rarely has the
attendance been over fifteen, although the
names of over 700 members in good stand
ing appear on the union's roll. Those who
have stayed away from the meetings have
done so for fear ttiut if it became known
that they were affiliating with the A. E. U.
people they would soon be among those
blacklisted. Last night, however, the
meeting hall was Tilled and the movement
was received with the greatest enthusiasm.
As stated, the niunner of how the new
federation shall be placed upon a solid
foundation was discussed, although it was
recognized that the matter is in tiie hands
of the convention's special committee.
The proposition that received the most
favorable consideration and which is be
ing seriously considered by many of the
members of tbe committee is that on
Which the Western Labor Council is based.
Delegate L. K. Stinson in explanation
stated that the Western Labor Council is
an organization of all the trades in Wash
ington, Idaho and Montana. Each State
and Territory has its own central body
which sends its delegates to the general
central body, which meets in Butte, Mont.,
every year. This body passes upon the
qualifications of every candidate for Con
gressional honors, and the candidates
selected are voted for to a man by every
voter in the entire amalgamation. '
The success of this plan is a matter of
record. Candidates for legislative posi
tions are passed upon by the central body
of the State and tiie same course is pur
sued with reference to county and munici
pal selections. The fundamental point is
that whatever the selection be the labor
union men stand by the edict.
Mr. Stinson holds that the same course
can be successfully followed by an amal
gamation of all the unions in Oregon,
California, Nevada and Arizona, and the
proposition is being seriously considered
by the committeemen. He said:
The City organization is the first step. We
will go into politics and stand by the men of
our selection. The A. K. U. men,"TOJ strong,
can control all the way from iive to 100 voters
outside of our union. Thia power of itself will
elect or defeet any candidate in the field, no
matter what party he may belong to. This
movement will be a success, notwithstanding
that there may be a few who are opposed to
radical measures. They will see, however,
that iheir only hope lies in the formation of a
Pacific Coast amalgamation, and that partisan
differences must be buried. 1 feel confident in
saying that the radical and progressive ele
ment in the labor unions in this City will con
trol enough votes to put the workingmen's
candidate to the front, and that is what we are
going to do. /
In Mclyor's resolution was the clause
''Prohibition of the employment of
children of school age and of the employ
ment of female labor in occupations
detrimental to health and nioralitv.
* * * Equalization of women's wages
with those of men where equal service is
performed." A strong movement toward
enforcing the observance of these prin
ciples has already been started by the
leaders of the progressive element. H.
M. Saunders of the Carpenters' has started
the ball in motion. He and T. F. Burns
of the Cigar-maker3\ in comparing notes,
summed up half a dozen "sweatshops"
in this City where children under 14 years
of age are worked hard when they should
be at school. In these same places
women are overworked and poorly paid
until many are breaking down in health.
The places enumerated are principally
factories where cheap clothing is made for
men and boys. Mr. Saunders said:
I believe that there Is a law against child
labor, but it Is full of flaws. What will be done
is to call the attention of the Labor Commis
sioner to these sweatshops, and make the sys
tem so unpopular here as to drive the proprie
tors out of business pr make them reform.
I wili bring this matter before the Building
Trodes Council to-morrow night and have it
taken up by the painters and decorators and
the district council of carpenters at their next
meetings. The delegates to these bodies will
make reports to their unions, and the latter
bodies will give their delegates to the conven
tions instructions upon the matter. We will
break up the system if we have no solid law to
work upon.
The District Council last evening voted
?100 to District Organizer E. O. Malsbury
to go to Sacramento next week and organ
ize the carpenters of that city. It was de
cided to cease patronizing cigar-dealers
who handle cigars made by firms in De
troit employing little children. It also
de< ided to recommend that the carpenters'
unions raise the initiation fee to $10 on
May 1. This is for the purpose of prevent
ing members from leaving the unions dur
ing dull times. On March 7 a social
smoker and reunion cf carpenters will be
held at 115 Turk street, under the auspices
of the council. The committee in charge
thereof are R. B. Ingle, J. Krajewski,
Thomas Done, P. McDonough and J. E.
McVicker.
All of the barbers' organizations in this
City have joined their forces and will make
common cause against any and all vio
lators of the Sunday closing law who shall
keep their places of business open after 12
o'clock on Washington's birthday. Bar"
bers finding any violations will report the
same to an executive committee which
will be in session all of Saturday afternoon

It was decided to print 10,000 tickets at
50 cents each and 3000 tickets at 25 cents
the latter for children.
Woodward's Pavilion was chosen as the
place for holding the celebration, and there
will be two entertainments, one in the

THE GOVERNOR'S TOUR.
He Will Go South and Thoroughly In-
ventigate the Whittler Institution.
Governor Budd will leave the City this
evening, to attend a meeting of the State
Board of Examiners at Sacramento to
morrow. He lids very nearly completed
his tour of inspection of State institutions.
He said yesterday that his next important
work in this Jine would be in the southern
part of the State.
He was asked if the investigation and
inspection of the management of affairs at
Whittier would be unusually diligent, em
bracing an inquiry in detail* regarding the
manner of conducting: that institution.
To this question he replied that he intended
to make a thorough examination there,
and get all the information possible re
garding that institution.
Governor Budd's health is fully restored
and he feels confident of his ability to de
fend the surplus in the State treasury. By
the time the Legislature convenes the sur
plus will amount to $750,000. Several
State institutions are already figuring on
getting a good lift from the funds so abun
dantly provided by the tax levies author
ized by the Legislature at its last session.

VERDICT FOR THE PASTOR.
Claims of Ellen Gallagher's
Heirs Not Accepted by
a Jury.
FATHER NUGENT EXONERATED.
The Rector of St. Rose's Parish Justi
fied in His Transactions With
the Widow.
The trial of the case of P. J. White,
special administrator of the estate of
Ellen Gallagher, against the Rev. Denis
Nugent, pastor of St. Rose's Church, came
to a close yesterday in Judge Hunt's court.
After mature deliberation the jury re
turned a verdict for Father Nugent.
The suit was brought at the instance of
the heirs of Thomas and Ellen Gallagher.
They are Peter and James Collins, Mar
garet Collins, Hannah Kelly and James
McCullom. They sought to recover
$140,000, which they alleged that Father
Nugent, by the exercise of undue influence,
secured from decadent's estate for his own
benefit and of that of the church. Arch
bishop Riordan was made a party to the
suit, as the church property within the
diocese stands in his name.
In his opening statement of tbe case for
the plaintiffs Barclay Herriey said that
Thomas Gallagher died- in January, 1892,
leaving an estate worth $190,000 in stocks]
cash and realty. He lived near Sr. Mary's
Hospital and was on intimate terms with
Father Nugent, whom he nominated as
executor of his will without bonds. His
wife and Kingston were aiso executors,
but Nugent was the active one among
them â ho did all the work practically
alone. Thomas Gallagher left property to
his wife worth $147,000.
In all, the attorney said, Mrs. Gallagher
gave the pastor sums of money aggregat
ing between $130,000 and $150,000. No
written acknowledgments of any Kind
were made concerning these transfers.
These transfers were not known by Galla
gher's heirs until after Ellen Gallagher's
death, and then Father Nugent made it
known.' To be suie, he had some receipts,
but they are not witnessed, and are in his
own handwriting. One of these was writ
ten by him two or three days before the
death of Ellen Gallagher and while she
was on her deathbed. This receipt repre
sents the transfer of no less than $30,000.
She made a will leaving her relatives
several bequests. She had received from
the court since her husband's death $500
or $600 a month, in all amounting to about
$10,000. This was put out to interest, but
what it h;is netted is not known. Mr.
Henley said the plaintiffs would show the
jury that the priest's influence had led
Mrs. Gallagher to forget her own people,
ani that if she had been left to herself she
would have remernhered her kindred.
The defense showed a different state of
affairs, however â that Mrs. Gallagher was
an intensely religious woman, "but pos
sessed of sound mind. She gave the pas
tor about $140,000 to build a church and
rectory in St. Rose's parish. At the same
time she gave $30,000 to relatives. It was
shown that she was simply carrying out
the proposition long before understood
between her husband and herself.* Her
husband used to say that the property
was not his but was really held in trust,
and he wanted it to go back to God, from
whom it came, and to charity.
It was proved that Mrs. Gallagher was
imbued with the same spirit and that she
had an ambition to build the parish
church, while her name was to have been
withheld until the dedicatory ceremony.
The fight fo r the money came from rela
tives of Mrs. Gallagher living In Philadel
phia. Members of her family in this City
were on the other sideâ the defenseâ as
witnesses and testified favorably for the
pastor. Their evidence was corroborative
of his statements, and, besides, Mrs. Gal
lagher's attorneys, Jones & O'Donnell,
testified that the disposing of the property
was legal and regular.
BLOOMER GIRLS SUBSIDE.
Closing Up of the Dunce Hall Where
Trousers Were Worn.
"Bloomer Hall" is a thing of the past.
That is the place on Grant avenue wnere
girls danced, served drinks ana tended to
wants of patrons who cared to try their
skill at the shooting gallery or in the bowl
ing alley.
The place created a furor when it opened,
the bloomer girls being the main attrac
tion. This soon died out and "Minnesota

GOVERNOR BUDD
AND THE REGENTS
Plain Talk About the De
signs for Affiliated
Colleges.
COST OF THE BUILDINGS.
Report of Expert Architects
Sharply Criticized by
the Governor.
THE PLANS RECOMMENDED.
Designs Presented by Krafft and Cur
lett Received Favorable
Report.
There was a breezy session of the Board \
of Regents of the University of California I
at the Mark Hopkins Institute yesterday
afternoon. The business on hand which
engrossed so much attention was the re
port of consulting architects on various ;
plans presented far the arliliated colleges. !
Governor Budd presided and took an
active interest in the proceedings through- j
out the sessions. When Secretary Bonte
called the roll the following named regents |
responded : The Governor, Speaker Lynch, j
State Superintendent of Schools Black. C. |
F. Crocker. A. S. Hallidie, T. G. Puelps, \
George T. Marye, Columbus Bartlett, Gen- j
era! Houghton, .1. Went Martin, Albert ;
Miller, President Kellogg, J. B. lteinstein, \
Judge Slack, Regent Chase, Arthur Rodgers j
and J. A. Wayruire.
As soon as the assembled regents squared
themselves at the table for business the
secretary was requested to produce the re
port submitted by Architects Clinton Day,
Albert Pissis and Walter Mathews. The
report discusses the plans in their alpha
betical order and presents the following
conclusions:
In conclusion : We consider that the best ele
vationÃ are those presented by William Curlett,
and they would form a very imposing and
monumental group of buildings.
We are further of the opinion that the group
which, if carried out, would best serve the pur
poses intended and would make the best and
most commodious buildines is, without doubt,
the one furnished by Messrs. KratVt, Martens &
Coffey, which we place at the head of the list.
As to cost, we will state that in ordinary
practice the cost of buildings is governed
tolely by the price of labor ana material, and
the quantity of each required in any building.
We can, therefore, take It for granted that to
corer the same surface -of ground with build
ings of the same character, built of tiie same
material, the cost will be the same. Judging
from that standpoint, we find that the designs
<.i Messrs. KrafTc, Martens 4t Coffey and oi Mr.
Sutton are. in our opinion, the most econom
ical of those presented, being about equal as to
cost. Next ingner would be the design or Mr.
Curlett. Messrs. Pelton & McDougail's design
Veing highest, the greater surface covered by
the buildings of Messrs. McDougall being off
set by the more costly architectural feature of
Mr. l'elton's production.
We also rind that the buildings of Messrs.
Krail't. Martens it Coffey and oi Mr. Sutton do
not contain more than is required by the
printed circulars, and that the space in'both
those designs has been thoroughly utilized;
that is to say, we do not think, that the re
quirements could have been fulfilled in
â mailer buildings.
Haying computed the probable cost of the
erection of the buildings shown by these two
designs, we lind that the construction of either
group would far exceed the full amount of the
appropriation. Respectfully submitted,
Ai.Kci'.T i'ispis,
Clinton DAT,
Walter J. Mathbws.
The subject of cost was immediately in
troduced, which led to a discussion be
tween Attorney Mhoon of the board and
tiovernor Budd as to whether the architect
was not bound by the law to give a suili
cient bond to guarantee the construction
ol tbe buildings within the limit of cost
specified.
The Governor embraced the opportunity
to cite the construction of the Stockton
Free Library as an example of a fine
building completed according to cost esti
mates submitted by Architect Pelton, al
though other architects had proclaimed to
the Stockton authorities that the work
could not be done for anything like the
Bum mentioned by Mr. Pelton. The figure
which "cut some ice" in this case was
?T>o,ooo.
In a communication to the Regents Mr.
Curlett announced that two responsible
contractors had figured on his plans. One
was willing to give a bond to construct the
buildings for $1'20,000. The other esti
mated that the cost would be $242,000.
.1. West Martin mentioned that Albert
Pissis was present and would cast some
light on the problem of cost. The Regent
thought if the session was executive Mr.
Pissis might explain in detail to the board
the method adopted to estimate the cost.
The Governor remarked that Mr. Me-
Dougall had made an estimate ot cost in
detail.
Regent Crocker said tliat it was the in
tention that all the architects should make
careful estimates of cost.
Regent Timothy Guy Phelps was anxious
to go into executive session.
The Governor inquired in a manner
which seemed frank and ingenuous, al
though the language was somewhat sig
nificant, "Is it the custom of the board to
go into executive session?"
Colonel Crocker indicated that he pre
ferred an open session if Mr. Pissis did not
object.
(â overnor Budd â I should prefer when
discussing the question of spending public
money to have the session public.
For an instant there was a perceptible
change in the light of the room, caus&d by
a simultaneous blush.
Inaudible talk, obviouslv in the cause of
executive session, followed.
The motion was made by Mr. Hallidie
or Mr. Martin to go into executive ses
sion, and. being seconded by Timothy Guy
Phelps, the Governor put it. A decided
majority voted in the atlirruative. Mr,
Crocker voted against the motion.
A- the reporters, ieeling that their
departure would afford relief were about
to vanislj-, the Governor signified thatthev
could remain if Mr Pissis, the architect,
did not object, and they remained.
Architect Albert Pissis did not seem to
be embarrassed by the presence of news
paper people and replied distinctly to
many questions addressed to him by the
Governor and other regents. According
to his explanation ttie committee of archi
tects did not go into a detailed examina
tion of cost, but calculated from the
ground space covered that decent build
ings could not be constructed for the sum
estimated â J2SOIMJ.
Governor Budd referred with evident
local pride to tbe Stockton Free Library
building a* a monument of grace anil
beauty, and ne renewed the assertion that
skilled architects had said that it could not
be built for $50,000, yet the designing
architect completed it for $30,008. Frmn
this example iresh in his mind and ob
viously impressed by a mental image of
the beautiful edifice the Governor reasoned
that general opinions of architects were of
no value unless sustained by detailed esti
mates of cost for wood, brick and building
material of all kinds.
Regent Albert Miller believed in exact
ing from the architect whose plans should
be accepted a sufficient bond to construct
the building at a cost not to exceed the
appropriation of $250,000.
tieueral Houghtou asked Mr. Pissis
how much the buildincs would cost
according to the estimates of the consulting
architects.
Speaking for himself. Mr. Pissis said he
placed the cost at $310,000.
To the Governor the architect said,
"We knew that cheaper material than
common brick would be used."
Then arose the vexed question whether
Roman brick would not show stains and
discolorations. The Governor asked if the
regents could show any building in San
Francisco constructed of brick of this de
scription which was not disligured by
stains.
Colonel Crocker remarked that the
Roman brick in the Towne residence was
not marred by stains.
Governor Budd expressed his displeas
ure at the insufficiency of the report from
the consulting architects. He wanted the
cost specified in detail. He said: "I will
not surrender my judgment to such a re
port aa this. 1 tell the regents now that if
the Dlans do not meet my judgment I will
nut approve them when they come before
meat Sacramento."
Regent Reinstein â We should have some
one here to point out defects in all the
plans.
(â overnor Budd â That is what* l propose
to have. There is no information to my
mind in this report of expert architects.
Why are they not here? 1 understood
everything was cooked and prepared for
us to eat, but I see that even the hare has
not been caught.
Regent Miuer explained that no notice
was given to the architects requesting
them to be present. He moved, as a solu
tion of the question, that the secretary be
requested to ask the architects if they
could give bonds to complete the buildings
for $250,000.
General Houghton said if the consulting
architects were called before the board
that it would be found that they had gone
far enough by cubic feet measurement,
which architects employed, to rind that
the work could not be done for $250,000.
Governor Budd â I think this board has
a right to ask all about the detects. This
committee of expert architects has thrown
out two plans simply on account of cost.
Mr. McDougr.ll presented an idea in his
design which escaped all notice of the
committee.
It was resolved, after further talk, in
which Architects Krafft and Sutton partici
pated in replying to questions, that the
meeting should adjourn until 10:30 a. m.
to-day.
Architects Albert Pisais, Clinton Day and
W'aJter Blatuews will be informed of this
meeting with a request to attend.
The Governor remained at the institute
until evening examining the plans, par
ticularly the space for admitting light.
He measured the plan3 with a rule and
generally fortified himself with informa
tion for to-day's session.
MAY CAUSE A BATE WAR
The Southern Pacific Company's
Breach of Contract
Resented.
Troops Transported at Cut Rates Over
the Sunset Route to Cheat
Western Lines.
The Western Passenger Association,
which has its headquarters at Chicago and
in which all the railways engaged in trans
continental business west of the Mississippi
are supposed to be united, is in a ferment
over what some members claim to be a
breach of the compact.
The association was organized and nas
been maintained for the purpose of keep
ing up passenger rates across the contin
ent, and one of its most active members
was i he Southern Pacific ComnaDy of
Kentucky. Its aim was to have all the
railways in the combine work for mutual
interests that profits might be secured on
every possible occasion by thus working in
harmony.
A dispatch in The Call of yesterday
contains the information that this har
mony was a tiling of the past, or in other
words that certain railway companies in
Colorado have risen in their anger with a
protest against the Southern Paciiic of
Kentucky.
These Chicago-Colorado lines have been
lett out in the cold by Huntington and his
managers exactly as the Central Pacific
has been shunned of late in the interest of
the Sunset route.
The trouble all came about over the
trainload of sailors and soldiers which re
cently passed over the Sunset route be
tween New York and San Francisco. The
Southern Paciiic made an arrangement
with an Eastern seaboard line at very
moderate terms to carry the special mili
tary trains from New York to New Or
leans via Portsmouth, ami the company
did the rest by taking the sailors and
marines over its southern line at greatly
reduced rates. Through the combination
it was possible to convey the men at prices
much below the Transcontinental Associa
tion standard, and at those figures a con
tract was made with the Government for
the transportation of the troops.
General Passenger Agent Goodman of
the Southern Paciiic explained yesterday
that no rule of the transcontinental com
pact had been violated. Before the con
tract to transport the military was entered
into, tlie president of the association was
notified, and at the same time he was
asked to Rive an opinion on the subject.
The president replied by telegraph that
the Southern Pacific Company could make
the contract, and so it was understood that
the association had given its permission
for this special case.
The Chicago-Colorado lines viewed the
matter in quite another light when they
learned that business, which should have
come to them. were the association's agree
ment lived up to, had been diverted over
the Southern route. A vigorous protest
followed, and a meeting of the association
was held in Chicago Tuesday to consider it.
Representatives of the Chicago-Colorado
lines demanded that notice be served on
the Southern Pacific to discontinue such
practices. Those roads insisted that pas
sengers should not be taken half way
round America simply to evade the asso
ciation's rules and thereby escape from
the agreement on rates, they also held
that it was a clear case of violation of their
rights under the compact. Business was
taken from them by a 'subterfuge, they say,
and as the midland lines have accordingly
lost money in consequence, it is claitaed
by railroad men that trouble is sure to
ensue. Should the tactics be repeated by
the Southern Pacific, the midland roads
have announced they will break up the as
sociation and institute a war on passenger
rates into California if necessary.
"This is nothing more nor less than an
other instance of the Southern Pacific of
Kentucky diverting business from the
Central Pacific," said a railroad ticket
agent of one of the Western roads j-es
terday on the street. "The special rate
could not be made on -the central route
without giving some of the money to the
Western lines, so the Kentucky corpora
tion went to work and connived with the
East Coast air line to carry troops from
New York to New Orleans to connect with
its own road there on a cheap basis. It
was only a Southern Pacific trick to beat
the association.
"The other roads ought to have known
better than to enter into an agreement
with the Southern I'acltic on any proposi
tion. The Southern Pacific could not keep
a contract, anyhow. It will do the worK
and make explanations and excuses after
ward; and what are you going to do
about it?"
Very Awkward Indeed.
This is precisely the kind of mistake a man
makes if he "turns out" on the wrong side of the
road when a vehicle comes toward him. No less
atisurd is the error of the individual who takes
drastic medicines to relieve his liver. That organ
is on the right side, and the road to its relief is
Hostetter's stomach Bitters, a medicine also
adapted to the relief of dyspepsia, constipation,
kidney and rheumatic uilmems and malaria.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1896.
WILL ERECT A STATUE.
Noble Project of the Balfe-Moore
Club in Honor of Irish
Genius.
DISCUSSED BY ITS PRESIDENT.
The New Literary Organization Would
Like to Place a Monument in
the Park.
The Balfe-Moore Club, it now transpires,
has a noble object in vie Â«fâ distant, how
ever, that prospect may beâ and one which
has not yet appeared in the preamble of the
society. It is still as an unwritten project,
although not a single member has been
found whose opinions are not in entire
harmony with the idea. Many of the more
intensely patriotic Irishmen, who form the
leading ranks of this club, look upon the
subject with longing for its realization.
For they are desirous of seeing a monu
ment in enduring bronze, a marble to per
petuate the name of the Balfe-Moore Club,
as well as do honor to two of their illus
trious countrymen.
The project, briefly stated, is to erect a
monument in Golden Gate Park to Moore
and Balfe or to Goldsmith, Grat:an or
some other great Irishman. And further
this statue must be a work of art that
would adorn the park and be an object of
interest to visitors of all nations.
Among tiiose members of the club who
are specially interested in the monument
is James 1). Pbelan. Mr. Phelan's name
is so associated with every movement in
San Francisco looking toward the ad
vancement of art or adding to the beauti
fying of the City that nis support and
sympathy are regarded by other members
of the club with feelings oi much encour
agement.
J. J. O'Brien is another leading member
of the club who will do all he can to pro
mote the idea of a grand monument, for he
would like to see it a reality in the people's
pleasure-ground as a mark of honor to his
illustrious countrymen. Rev. D. 0. Crow
ley, Thomas R. Bannerman, Jeremiah
Mahoney, Dr. O'Toole and others, all
leading spirits of the Balfe-Moore Club,
are right in line with the rest for the same
object.
The idea has not been formally discussed
as yet, but then the Balfe-Moore Club is a
mere infant, with an auspicious beginning
in the world and a brilliant literary and
musical career before it. And so, like the
development of ths club itself, this monu
ment project can grow only with time. It
has been mentioned more than once, how
ever, when members of the club met, and
consequently, for all practical purposes, it
has already assumed pretty definite form.
It was discussed last evening by Thomas
R. Bannerman, president of the club. He
said :
"There is a settled conviction among
many of the members that one of the ob
jects of the Balfe-Moore Club in the near
future is to undertake the raising of a
monument to Moore and Balfe, or Gold
smith, or some other illustrious Irishman.
The individual, of course, is a matter to
be decided by the club. We feel that the
park authorities and the people would be
pleased to see a statue to one, or, perhaps,
two, of these men of genius in Golden Gate
Park, since it would be a noble ornament
of itself and a fitting tribute from the
Celtic people of this City to Celtic emi
nence 111 art and letters.
"Just the same we would like to see
monuments to Longfellow, Washington Ir
ving, Bryant or oilier great Americans, as
these statues tend to cultivate an interest
in the graces and lead men into a closer
knowledge of the accomplishments of
American gen mis.
"For my own part I have no doubt but
that if the matter of a monument to Moore
and Balfe was undertaken by the respon
sible men of our young society it would
soon be realized. From the immense au
dience last night and from the gratifying
reception to the initial meeting of the
club we tind more encouragement almost
than I can express, and this is enough en
couragement lor us to go ahead with the
ultimate idea of a noDle statue to our
country "s genius. I do not speak for the
club in this matter, but my opinions upon
it are those of many of my associates.
"For a plan of action I would suggest a
series of concerts similar to what' we had
last night, and then by depositing the
money received in a fund, even though it
took some years, we would in the end have
our desires accomplished. We would not
aim to draw upon the generosity of the
masses of our people. The club itself is
not intended to be a popular organization.
Its membership is limited to men of taste
and the ability of accomplisning the ob
ject of the clun. We propose to give balls
and reunions periodically, and by keeping
such a fund as many of ray associates
favor for a monument, the project, once
undertaken, we feel sure, would inspire
our people with enthusiasm in the move
ment and stimulate them to support the
cause."
David Costello, an active worker in the
Balfe-Moore Club management, said: "I
am heartily in accord with everything Mr.
Bannerman says, and I would give my
personal services with the greatest pleas
ure to carry out the grand idea. Every
Irishman should be proud to have an op
portunity of lending a hand in this pro
ject. Our Cerrnan fellow-citizens have set
a good example. They will have a splen
did monument to Goethe and Schiller, and
I believe the cost will not exceed $10,000.
Now, surely we can do as well as that, for
if we set about it once in the right way
$10,000 or so would not be long forth
coming.
IRISH SONGS AND POEMS.
Brilliant Pirst Night of the Balfe-Moore
Club.
The Balfe-Moore Club held a most enjoy
able open session Tuesday night at Metro
politan Temple. A pleasant feature of the
affair was a well-selected programme of
Irish airs rendered by various well-known
vocalists, Dr. A. E. Regensberger's fantasia
of Irish airs on the violoncello being spe
cially deserving of mention.
Midway in the concert programme Will
iam Greer Harrison delivered a most inter
esting lecture on "Balfe and Moore."
"Poetry," said Mr. Harrison, "is just
one heart talking to another, and music is
the same thing in another way.
"Speaking generally," he proceeded,
"poetry and music, specially considered,
may be taken as the evidences of a na
tion's literary progress. The civilization
of a nation is measured by it's literature.
The poetry and music of any nation will
correspond to its literature. Indeed,
poetry is the favorite child of literature,
and music seems to be an evolution of the
poetical faculty. In speaking, therefore,
of Celtic poetry and music we must tirst
look to Celtic literature and take its
measure.
"Owing to the desire of the Celtic race to
discover and present to the world absolute
proofs of its past greatness, various
scholars gave to the literary universe a
wealth of material, which has caused
numbers of distinguished scholars to de
vote their lives to a complete and ex
haustive study of Celtic literature. But
let us glance hastily at what that litera
ture comprises. We take, first, the 'An
nals of the Four Masters, 1 ' contained
in seven large quarto volumes of 4215
paees; then we have ttie great vellum
manuscript books belonging to Trinity
College, Dublin, and to the Royal Acad
emy, such as the book of Leinster, the
book of Le Cain and others, having suf
ficient material to fill nearly 12,000 pages.
Other niauuscriptÃ in Trinity College and
the Royal Academy have matter enough
to fill auout 40,000 pages.
"This mass of literature naturally falls
into several divisions. There are tales,
historic and imaginative, which refer to
love, to Battles, voyages, sieges, expeai
tions, banquets, elopements, etc. Then
would follow the annals, giving us the
dates of the foundations of churches and
castles, the obituaries of notable person
ages, the coronations of kings, the battles
of chiefs, the conquests of clans, and the
ages of bards, abbots and bishops.
"Following this, came the pedigrees,
genealogies and martyrologies, which con
tain traditions committed to writing at a
period when the ancient customs of the
Celtic people were unbroken. In these
ancient works was a mass of poetry which
Thomas Moore translated and adapted
into English verse. Michael William Balfe,
delighted with these ancient songs,
collected them and used them in his
operatic works, notably in 'The Bohemian
Girl.' Singly and together, thfesetwo men
have done "much for Celtic poetv and
music, eriving each art a place in the world
of song and letters."

NO CLEW TO THE ROBBERS
The Man With the Sack Sup
posed to Have Jumped on
a Passing Car.
Cashier Hopkins and Accountant Hay.
hurst Completely Unnerved by
Their Experience.
The police so far are absolutely without a
clew to the identity of the three robbers
who held up Cashier Hopkins and Ac
countant Hayhurst of the Market-street
Bank on Tuesday morning and stole $3600.
Detectives made all possible inquiry
yesterday with a view lo ascertaining if |
any one had seen the robbers leave the |
bank with their booty, but without success. !
It is the general belief that the man '
with the sack jumped on a passing cable- :
car, a? a car passes the bank about every
thirty seconds either to or from the ferry. I
A large number of people impelled by |
curiosity visited the bank yesterday and
took a morbid interest in examining the !
mark made by the bullet on the top rail of
the counter.
President Lillis is not in the least wor
ried about the loss of the money, but tie is
exceedingly anxions to Ret his eyes upon
â the three robbers. This is not the only
kink in which he has a controlling inter
est, lie practically owns the Ban* of
llanford, the Bank, of Lenioore and the
Bank of Oroville.
"You can say for me," said Captain Lees
last night, "that the bank robbery was a
trenuine one, and had been carefully
planned. I have known President Lillis
for many years and have had business
with him before. He is the great cattle
king and one of the wealthiest men in the
State. I do not know the cashier or ac
countant, but Mr. Lillis told me that he
had such confidence in them that he would
trust them with every cent he was pos
sessed of, and that was saying a great
deal."
The captain said he had no new infor
mation to give, but he was picking up all
the points he could get. He had Account
ant Hay hurst with him last night for some
time, but the accountant had verj' little to
add to what has already been published.
Both cashier and accountant were some
what unnerved yesterday after they began
to realize the narrow escape they had from
being shot by the robbers.
"If it had not been that the bars of the
vault were thrown out," said Hayhurst,
"we would have been locked up in the
vault and the probability is we would have
been suffocated before "help reached us.
They tried three times after driving us
into the vault to close the doors, but the
bars prevented it. Then it was that we
heard one of the robbers say, 'We had bet
ter kill them.' We thought our time had
come sure enough, and it was a great re
lief when we heard them going away."
EMMET'S BIRTHDAY.
It Will Be Celebrated by the Knight's
of the Keil Branch on nn Ex
tensive Scale.
The committee of arrangements of the
Robert Emmet birthday celebration met
at K. R. 11. hall last night. There was a
general meeting of the Knights, and it was
followed by a committee meetine. There
was a large turnout of the members of the
society and great enthusiasm prevailed.
A large number of seats have already
been taken for the exercises at Metropoli
tan Hall on Wednesday evening, March 4.
John P. Finerty of Chicago will be the ora
tor of the occasion and there will be Irish
music and Irish songs.
The committee decided last night to en
tertain the visiting lecturer by a banquet
at which many of the leading Irishmen of
the City will be invited to be present.
There is every reason to believe that the
celebration will be the most successful ever
held on Emmet's birthday in San Fran
cisco.
WILL EMPLOY FIVE CLERKS.
Registrar Hlnton Preparing for the
Coining Primary Election.
The Board of Election Commissioners
yesterday authorized Registrar Hinton to
emplov five clerks to begin the work of
preparing for the primary elections that
take place on March 31 next. Though
the decision of the Supreme Court regard
ing the constitutionality of the primary
election law has not yet been handed down
the Commissioners decided that to delay
further would be to run the risk of being
behind hand with the preparations. Mr.
Hinton was instructed to make all haste in
preparing the lists of electors from which
will be chosen the names of those who
will serve ns election officers.
He was also instructed to get the ballot
boxes ready and secure polling places.
A resolution was passed requesting all
political parties desiring to hold a conven
tion under the law to send in their peti
tion to the boaTd as required by section
2of the primary election law before the
Ist of March.
Died From Natural Causes.
Mamie Pease, the young woman who was
taken from her home, at 42 Turk street, to the
City and County Hospital on the 18ih inst.,
supposedly suffering from the effects of a crimi
nal operation, died yesterday afternoon. The
body was taken to the Morgue and an autopsy
held by Dr. J. B. Barrett. The ajtopsy re
vealed the fact that the girl had died from
natural causes.
BODD ON COL. HARRINGTON
The Governor Is Not Conscience-
Keeper to His Judge Advo
cate General.
THE COLONEL IN KENTUCKY.
Harrington of Colusa Vigorously Pleads
the Railroad Cause in Ken
tucky's Capital.
Lawyer and "Colonel" John T. Har
lington of Colusa is in Frankfort, Ken
tucky, opportunely so for Collis Persistent
Huntington, and appears to be improving
his visiting time by constituting himself a
formidable champion of the Southern
Pacific Company in the pending fight in
the Kentucky Legislature over the bill
providing lor the repeal of the franchise
of the Southern Pacific Company.
Mr. Harrington seems to see his duty to
Colusa County and to the State, whose
government he represents to the extent of
being judge advocate general on Governor
Budd's staff, in a defense of the benign
railroad company and the charter which it
managed to get from an Eastern State in
which it could have no other interest, so
that it might in some measure be treed
from the jurisdiction of the State courts to
which it was properly beholden.
Harrington first saw the light and the
little red schoolhouse in the neighborhood
of Frankfort, Kentucky, and since the
Kentucky Legislature has convened he
has appeared there for the first time in
over thirty years to r.-visit the scenes of
his boyhood. He looms up In the Ken
tucky capital as Colonel John T. Harring
ton of California, judge advocate general
on Governor Budd's staff. That adds
weight to his eloquent and ringing words
to the members of the Kentucky Legisla
ture.
The appearance in Kentucky's capital of
the judge advocate general on Governor
Budd's staft, while he acts as an attorney
for the railroad company and declares that
he voices the sentiments of the people of
California, is a matter concerning which
Governor Budd's ideas of the propriety of
it are of pertinent interest. Governor
Budd was asked about Colonel Harring
ton's railroad operations yesterday. In
his reply the Governor spoke with his
usual frankness and vigor, saying in effect
three things: That he was not before ac
quainted with Colonel Harrington's atti
tude on the Southern Pacific question,
that he did not know that he was respon
sible for Harrington's private views on the
matter, and that he wa.s unwilling to say
what he might or might not think, or do if
circumstances should bring the matter
more definitely to his attention in the
future.
"Alt I know about the matter is what I
have read in the papers," said the Gov
ernor. "I see that Mr. Harrington states
ihat he is there simply to visit his old
home and friends, and 1 knew some time
ago that he intended making such a visit.
It appears that while there in that way he
baa expressed inuividual views in a news
paper interview.
"1 appointed Harrington as judge advo
cate-general because I thought him quali
fied for the position, a good Democrat and
a friend of mine. I never inquired and
never learned his views on the railroad
question. Ido not understand that it is
my duty to inquire into a man's religion
or his views on economic and other ques
tions when I appoint him to a position,
especially to an honorary one. I consid
ered only his qualifications for the place
to which he was appointed. Now I am
not the keeper of his conscience or his
mind, and I do not know that I am called
upon to muzzle a man boldinqsuch a posi
tion as his, in the expression of his per
sonal opinions.
"It is not necessary for me to discuss at
all my own views on the railroad question,
for everybody knows them. lam in favor
of the Government owning a railroad line
from one s-uie of the continent to the other,
and as to Mr. Harrington and his expres
sions I cannot, and in fact would not, in
timate what stand I might take if the mat
ter were presented to me definitely in the
future."
So Colonel Harrington may or may not
be called down by ttie Governor in his ad
vocacy of the interests of the Southern Pa
cific monopoly, while displaying in Ken
tucky his high-sounding title as a warrant
for his assuming to talk to the Kentucky
Legislature in behalf of the people of Cali
fornia.
It is the Capitol, a Frankfort daily news
paper, devoted to the monopoly interests,
which publishes a long interview with
Colonel Harrington. Says the article:
"In speaking of the bill now pending be
fore the Legislature for the repeal of the
cnarter of the Southern Pacific Company,
he says that the proposition does not meet
with the approval of the people of Cali
fornia.'
In his interview Colonel Harrington
gives the information that "outside of a
lew sensational newspapers and Mayor
Sutro ot San Francisco the proposition
has few adherents," and he says that the
opponents of the company out here are its
enemies through personal reasons. This
is especially the case, he asserts, with
Mayor Sutro, who is ufter the railroad be
cause it would not establish a rate of 5
cents to a place he had built for his
"privategain,"and who built that gigantic
swindle, the Sutro tunnel. California does
not suffer, Mr. Harrington testifies, and
he says that it would be a stupendous
piece of folly and wrong for Kentucky to
repeal the Southern Pacific charier.
All in all Colonel Harrington is about
the ablest advocate the Southern Pacific
Company has in Kentucky's capital at this
critical time, and if Collis doesn't see that
Colonel Harrington is a railroad attorney
for a long time in the future there will be
another case of base ingratitude to record.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
Mme. Tavary Sings Lucia at the
Baldwinâ Keene's Riche
lieu.
Performance of " Wife for Wife â  at
the Grand â "Freischutz" at
the Tivoli.
An excellent impersonation of the title
role in "Richelieu" was given last night
by Keene at the California Theater. This
actor excels more in roles requiring finesse
than he does in robust, heroic parts,
and his impersonation of the diplomatic
cardinal is one of the best in his repertoire.
The supporting company was, as usual,
far from being up to the standard of the
star, but, notwithstanding this lack of all
round balance, a most interesting: perform
ance of "Richelieu" was given.
"Lucia di Lamiuermoor" was sung at
the Baldwin Theater last night, with Mme.
Tavary in the title role. Guille, Abram
hoff and Max Eugene were all in the cast, aud
a satisfactory performance of Donizetti's
melodious work was given.
Katie Putnam aud her company are proving
a drawing attraction at the Columbia Theater.
The bright little actress is the chief attruciion
of the play, but lovers of the sensational find
the excitement they seek In the scene ol the
- m
old limekiln, from whictj. the drama takes it
name. ; There, on the brink of a pit, from which
- flames ascend, occurs a struggle for life, in
which the hero is all but thrown down to be
burned alive. This melodramatic situation is
one of the most applauded hits of the plav.
The now additions to the cast of the Grand
Opera company are repeating their success of
Monday night. Darrell Vinton and Miss Essie
Tittel have thoroughly captured the sympathy
of their audiences. The all-round performance
of -'Wife for Wife" is an excellent one.
The Alcazar production of "Faust" con
tinues to prove successful. Percy Hunting is
thoroughly at home in the role of Mephis
topheles, and Miss Mina Gleason makes an
engenuous Marguerite.
Preparations are being made to present some
patriotic tableaux and National vocal ami in
strumental music on the occasion of Washing
ton's birthday. . On February 24 the Carleton
Opera Company commences its seasou.
The Tivoli production of the "Freischutz" Is
proving one of the most successful'perform
ances that have been given at that house for
sometime. In Agatha Ida Valerga has a con
genial role, and Kate Marchi is also well
adapted to the part of Annie. Rattael has
made a decided hit tua Casper, and Martin
I'ache is evidently more in hjs element as Max
than he js in opera bo u tie roles.
The clever and diversified programme at the
Orpheuni this week Is being received with
outward and visible manifestations of satis
faction by the usual large audiences. The
I'antzers' head-balancing is considered to be
one of the most popular acts on the bill, and
the new monologues of Billy Carter and Car
roll Johnson generally win several recalls.
THE FRANKLIN BURGLARY.
No Identification of the Dead
Burglar, Who Will Be
Buried To-Day.
Captain Lees Denies the Report That
He Is Working On a New
Theory.
C. P. Maze of the firm of C. P. Maze &
Son, contractors at OS Jessie street, called
at the Morgue yesterday and Identified the
dead burglar as William Wade, a tramp
who had come from Chicago a short time
ago and who worked one day for the con
tractor. This identification is only one of
many of like uncertainty made during the
last few days. Mr. Maze's son called later
at the Morgue and said his father was
mistaken.
The dead burglar will be buried to-day,
and t:ib only hope the police have of his
identification is that if lie belonged to the
East, as believed, some one may be able to
recognize the marks on his arm and hands
when they read about it in the San Fran
cisco papers.
Captain Lees still clings to the belief
that the burglar was was a siraneer here,
and came from the Eastern States.
The captain last night denied the reports
that the detectives were working on a new
theory in regard to the burglary at the
Franklin residence.
A perfectly proportioned man weighs
twenty-eight pounds for every foot ol his
height.

Cold and Cough Cures
Promptly Effectual in Curing Grip.
Colds and Coughs and a Sure Pre-

Diseases.
Colds lead to coughs, cotigbs to Pneu-
monia and Consumption; therefore, it is
all important to check a cold before it
readies the lungs. Munyon's Cold Cure
will positively break a cold inside of tnren-
ty-four hours if taken as soon as the cola
manifests itself. When the cold reaches
the lungs or bronchial tubes the Cougl
Cure should be used alternately every half
hour with the Cold Cure. The Cold Cure
isguaranteed to prevent pneumonia if used
in tne beginning of a cold. Pneumonia,
or inflammation of the lungs, can be con-
trolled by t he use of these two cures.
The Cough Cure positively cures bron-
chitis, ticklintr in the throat, hoarseness,
loss of voice, soreness of the chest, diffi-
culty in breathing, hacking cough and all
pulmonary diseases where the lungs are
not too far consumed or covered with
tubercles.
If you are ailing, step into the nearest
drugstore and get a 25-cent vial of one of
Munyon's Remedies. No matter what your
disease, or how many doctors have failed
to cure, it will eive you relief.

ON HUDELSON
The Chancellor Says the
State A. P. A. President
Dodges.
"ONLY TRUTH IS NEEDED"
Brings Evidence to Substantiate
the " Los Angeles Case "
in Dispute.
CALUMNIES ARE DENOUNCED.
Rev. Mr. Hudelson Repeals Some of
the Questions Propounded and
Demands Answers.
The following communication has been
received by The Call:
ToUte Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: The Rev.
Benjamin Hudelson, State president of the
iT ' s verv carexul to dodge discussion on
the doings of his order. He produces his
â wonderful questions before the public for the
seventh time, ties them nicelv up in bundles
smiles complacently, "What a pretty
Ul this A. P. A." Surely the Kev. Benja
min Hudelson must retain much of the sylvan
â â¢!> of s-.>iiiyou to Imagine that the pub
â  be fooled with platitude*.
Americans know enough to refuse to give
credence to the professions of a frau.i, and
that the A.. P. a. is a fraud its deeds demon
strate without doubt. Hence in this rfbeus
|iÂ°" I can safely leave the Rev. Benjamin
iiiMelson to amase himself arranging his
pretty little questions as a baby does its Duild
'â ks. My object is to sho\v the public by
proven facts and authentic dooumeuts tnc true
inwardness of the A. 1". a.
NOTHING NEEDED BUT TBTJTH.
Let me repeat that I have no desire to do in
justice even to the A. P. A. In this discussion
anything bin the truth will injure ray cause.
1 have .offered to correct any misstatements I
may fall into and to apologize for any errors !
Into which I may be led. That offer I stand by
and when the Rev. Benjamin Hudeison can I
accuse me with truth of not living up to it |
then I am willing to withdraw from the con
trove r.-y.
Out of the many facts with which my last
jetter was filled the Rev. Benjamin Hudeison
found conrapo to question only one. He re
" explain how he could v^late the oath
I â¢ look with his hand on his heart, "I will !
not enter into any controversy with a Koman i
Catholic upon the subject of this order." He;
aid not deny that the A. P. A. used the forged â¢
encyclical, the spurious instructions and the
slanders about concealed arms to stir up ;
eotry. He jumped, however, at one unim
â  â¢riant circumstance in one of my facts, and !
he jumped at it bo readily that even the blind
an see that he did nut deny the other facts
: t-cause he dareÂ«l
To 6 how that the report about artns con- â '
â ealed in churches was not unknown in Cali
fornia I quoted an A. P. A. speech made in .
s Angeles. That speech 1 attributed to ex- !
'â overnor Sheidon. I was wrong. It was I
utterly immaterial to my argument whether
it was made by one or the other. The mistake
arose from the number of shelved politicians
and retired preachers connected with the
A. P. A.
In the galaxy of ex-Governors, ex-minister?,
ex-liverymen, ex-lawyers, ex-gamblers -which
shines in ihe A. P. A. firnianent it is difficult to
distinguish between star and star; hence I
pleaa guilty to the crime of confounding
t-heldon with Goeper, and I apologize to the
one who considers nimself aggrieved.
The mistake was entirely unintentional, and,
as the reader can tee, had no effect whatsoever
on my argument, no matter what effect it may
have on ex-Governor Sheldon's political as
j iranon?. I think it showed a lack of sagacity
:n the Kev Benjamin Hudelson to dwell so
much on the ambitions of his protege. There
b:e few booms which can 6urvive the indorse
ment of the A . P. A.
THE LOS ANGELES CASE.
The Rev. Benjamin Hudelson couches his
denial of the unimportant circumstance of the
rsoulity of the lecturer in Los Angeles in
? uch a mariner as to throw doubt on the au
thenticity of tne whole incident. In order to
I'rove my facts I quote from the Associated
i Teas dispatch dated September 29, 1594:
â¢i-:.\-Governor John Gos]>er. of Arizona, is the
supposed head of the A. P. A. here, and last, night
si'idressfd the Unity Club on the order and its
teiuurf* Ue made a passionate partisan argument,
k i>i at last miule this hcnsationul statement: 'They
siy they have a cathedral on -Main street. It
is nothing or the s -rt. It is an armory â an
arsenal wbera arms are stored. To-nieht there
are 5000 rifles stacked there, and they are in con
slant iM>e, too. by Catholics who are drilling in
order to tx-come familiar with them.'
"'Vou are a liar, iiDd you know it." ran? in clear,
RiroaÂ« tones through the church, and the aston
ished ectarer, loolcinc into the auditorium saw
the tall figure of D. P. Doneinn. a wealthy con
tractor, nis eyes blazing with anger aud waviuga
piece of paper over bis head. 'I challenge vou to
prove your assertion.' iKiiiL'ifan continued.
'â¢ Â»Uet the Chief of i'oUce and a squad of officers,
and if a single cun is found I will five th:s certi
fied check ior $1000 to i?o to the Associated Chari
ties. 1
"The s<^en<Â» which followed was exciting to a de
cree. >^>n-.e men wanted to put Donegan out. A
woman inmped on her chair and pointing her fin
ger at Go-pt-r reiterated JJonegau's words: 'You
are a liar.'
"CJosper looked as if he wished himself safe back
In Arizona, and chaos ruled for a time, Captain
tressy, the chairman Of the meeting; at last got a
semblance of order. He said he wooW not tole
rate, as chairman, any such language as th;f used
r>y Gosper and complimented Donovan by the way
in which he brought the errant Arizotiian to time.
Gosper jrot up and said the story ' had heen told
liim, Ml was promptly told auain that was a
liar, and he did Dot annie the point any further.
'â¢A iady stood up aadtold him she belonged to the
Kelief lorps of John a. Logan Post G. A. R., to
li:ch be belonged, and ihat he was well aware
that iis many Kii!lani and hard-.li;titmg Catholic
patriots were in the late war as I'rwestants. Mr.
GospeY ' was much disturbed and made an un
ostentatious departure."
i ts the story to which I referred and
men my authority for it. It is absolutely true.
â  r, as a represeniatiTe of the a. P. A.,
made these statements and he made them be
cause he was an A. P. A. They are part of the
:;sof that malodorous society. Sheldon
and Hudelsou an ible for them as
well as Qosper. I owe no apology to any leader
r>i fhe A. P. A. for accusing him of particl
pancy in the -pread of that slander. Ido owe
an apoiogy for confounding one A. P. A. lec
turer with another.
'Jo which of the two the apology should be
â¢ iI do not know. When Mr. Hudelson
certifies which is the less disreputable I will ,
send him a generous amende.
While I am on thU qoestioa I may as well
explain the part played by this calumny m the
popular teaching oi'tho a'. I'. A.
we w:ll then understand better my state
'liat Sheldon and Hudelson are as re

But according to the A. P. A. papers the

following delectable morsel:
A SPECIMEN CASK. -'-â¢â¢-'.

obedience the great mass of Koniantsts suppose
that as a matter of course they owe to their su
periorsâthe priests:
[ "A relative of mine told me that one of her

it was the duty of all belonging to the church to"
obey the <'lergy without questioning, no matter
what the order miÃht be. My cousin snid to her,
'Then, if your priest were to tell von to kill me,
your own cousin, you would do 60?' The reply

choice in the matter. 1 " \
The following is from page 5 of the issue of
September 6, 1894, and inculcates tho same
idea, but in more detail: ggQM
ROMISH IXOTIATITCPE AND HATE.
Rlilor of the Citizen; I gave the follow ine just
as it was told to me by a lady and her father, for
whose imegritv I can vouch. I use the lady's own
words. \Viixiam Chask, Uxbridge, Mass.
In a well-known village in Massachusetts sev
eral years ago my father and I lived (a little in the
suburbs of the town). Beside us lived a gentle
man (a Protestant) of a generous, Christian char
acterâone who was always striving to benefit his
fellow-men. He told my father that he previously
lived on a farm which adjoined that of a Koinan
Catholic, and for many years, by acts of generr
osity and kindness, he had iri<d to help lsls neigh
borâsending him aid in every wayâ helping him
with work on his farm when he was not well,
giving him assistance finauc ally and otherwise
trying to fulfill the command, ".Love thy neighbor
as" thyself."
"Thus things went on for "yearsâ my neighbor
always glad of assistance, but underneath his
stolid demeanor showinar an ungrateful spirit. But
' 1 kept on in ti'.y duly to my fellow-man until he
ni taken sick. Then I went over and helped
I about the work and watched with him until he
i died, which was several weeks after he had- taken
! sick. One nightâ the r.iÂ»?ht before he diedâ ne
, called me to him (liis voice was weak then) and
| said: 'Neighbor, you have done a great deal for
I me, but at the time you were doing your best for
â  .me I cjuld have cut your throat from ear to ear.
. No maiter what your kindness has been to rue,
' 1 could kill you every time with a good heart. I
hated you because you were a heretic, and when I
have been working with you, 1 have been tempted
I to slay you, and 1 could kill you now!'
"ihis was my rewurd tor years of faithfulness
: toward my neighbor. This proves 10 yon the in
: born hatred of Bomaniata toward Protestant
Christians, no matter bow kind they are to them
i in daily life.
'â¢Here is an ingratitude peculiar to Roman
Catholics which suould be made known to the
world."
Moreover Mr. Hurtelson's disciples are care
fully instructed that this inborn blood thirst i
aess breaks out into deeds. From page Â« of
the number dated October 11, ISS94, "1 extract
the following sapient remarks:
To thr Editor of the American Patriotâ Dear Sir:
Asa subscriber of your panor I wNh to be informed
whether or not "indulgences" c;tn be bought, for
the Roman Catholics in San Fraucisco? 1 heard
years ago that such was the case, aud having
watched their coarse it appears to me to be cor
rect, inasmuch as I find a majority of the above
rlass to have committed the foolest crimes on the
calendar. Notwithstanding 'this they escape pun-
Isbment In nearly every case, hut if a Protestant
or Jew commits a crime he seldom escaues. It
also appears to me that many Protestant families
have been poisoned, of those who have been so un
fortunate as to have employed Roman Catholic
servant eirls.
In reply to the above wo may say that we have

office of the ")
State Council, of California, !
Kooni 40. Academy of Science Bidg., f
Sl'J Market street.
San JfÃANCisco, Cal., Feb. 19, 189G.
To the Editor of The Callâ Dkar Sir: In my
last letter I demonstrated three logical propo
sitions which. I believe should be kept promi
nently before the people of this City and State.
For that reason I propose to incorporate them
in;o all my letters. These propositions are as
follows:
F1 rstâ The objects of the American Protective
Association are pood, whether viewed from the
standpoint oi its friends or from that of its
enemies. .
Secondâ That inasmuch as the objections of
tim Rev. Peter C. Yorke to the A. P. A. refer
not to the objects of the order, but have to do
wholly with Us piatform and political princi
ples therefore Father Yorke's hostility to the
A. P. A. is billed upon political differences and
is not caused by religious consideration.
Thirdâ That inasmuch as Father Yorke has
refused to define his position upon twelve full
principles of the A. P. A., his object in the
present controversy is to pain some petty per
sonal advantage rather than to enlighten the
people upon the truths involved.
In my last communication I demanded that
Father Yorke prove the following assertions
contained in his letter published on the 13th
iust.:
Statement 1 â "I know, however, that a secret
political society can never brins about puie
politics."
Statement 2â "l know that they (the Methodist
Bishops and preachers who are n^itat.ns the repeal
of the tax on church property) pay more taxea
th:m the whole a. I'. A. put together."
Siiiiemeut 3â -'A ton -iÂ«m-i who is not American
ized in five years will never be Americanized."
Statement 4â â¢â There are no universal proposi
tions in politics."
These are very high-sounding phrases. They
are fair samples of the "rounded period," anil
they "would be epigrammatic" sentences, for
which Father Yorke has such an apparent weak
ness. That I have the right to demand the
proof oi their correctness is evident from
Father Yorke's own words, written in this letter
of the 13th inbt.:
I have made no statement which I am not rearly
to proveâ not with mere assertions, hut with au
thentic documents, with affidavits and with facts.
Now. I want the "authentic documents, the
affidavits and the facts" in support of these as
sertions.
Two days ago, Mr. Editor, I charged Peter C.
Yorke with uttering concerning ex-Governor
Sheldon what was and is "absolutely and un-
QualLfiedljr, and, I believe, purposely false."
And I e,av*e adequate reasons for my belief that
tiie faUehood was willfully uttered.
Since the appearance ot that charge Father
Yorke has, up to the presentwriting, permitted
thirtv-six hours to pass without even disclaim
ing the wilfullness of the falsehood, to say
nothing of proving his words or apologizing
for uttering them.
There are several question?, Mr. Editor,
which I have repeatedly propounded to Father
Yorke and which he has guilelessly professed
to answer. In every instance, however, he
dodged the issue; and the questions are as
follows :
. ON THE A. P. A. PLATFORM.
Question 9â '-Is Mr. Yorke hostile to loyalty to
true Americanism, which knows neither birth
place, race, creed' nor party as a first requisite for
membership in any organiza ion?"
Question 11 <part)â "ls Mr. Yorke' hostile to the
toleration of all creeds?"
Question 13â "Is .Mr. Yorke hostile to the up
holding of the constitution of the United States
and its Kuarantee of religious liberty to the in
dividual ?"
: Question 16â "Does not ilr. Yorke believe that
exemption from taxation is equivalent to a grant
of public funds? And is he houile to th.Â« taxation
of all property, the title to wliich is not vested in
the National or State Government, or their sub
divisions?" . .
Question 17â "Does Mr. Yorke favor the enlist
ment in tue military arm of the Government of
any one not actually a citizen of the .United
Btates?" '
' Question 19â "Would Mr. Yorxe object to the re-"
peal of the act anthorizi-iK the : naturalization of
minors without a previous dpciaration of Intention,
and is he hostile to a provisiou of law that persons
IO be naturalized must spt-ak the language of the
land and must prove seven years' continuous resi
dence in this country from the date of the declara
tion of intention?" â¢ ,
Question "JOâ "Does Mr. Yorke object to a protest
against the laxity with which our present natural
ization laws are administered?" .-:â ., ,
Qnestion 21â "Is Mr. Yorke hostile to the public
inspection of. all hospitals, asylums, reformatories
or other Institutions, in which people are under re
straint?" .â .:â¢' .
Question "Does Mr. Yorlce favor National or
State legislation la favor of any one section of the
country, orcf any class?" ">.."'
ON A. P. A. POLITICAL PRINCIPLES.
â¢<â¢ Question 28-r-"Is Mr. Yorlte opposed to such re
striction of iinnilcration us will prevent paupers,
criminals and anarchists from landing on our
shore?" ' ' â  . . '
Question 25 part)â ''Does Mr. Yorke wish the
voters of the country to be ignorant of the duties
and |irnil-i;i's of citizenship, and. the pliant loo'.s
of politicians?" . .â  .
Question 2t>â -'Does Mr. Yorke oppose support
ing from the public iiin.i.s , one general | non-secta
rian tree public school system, snflicient for the
primary education of all children v\
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THUS SPAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1896.
Question 28â '-Does Mr. Yorice oppose the taxa
tion of non-Governmental property?"
Question 29â '-Does Mr. Yorke 'support for oflice
any person who recognizes allegiaucu to any
foreign or ecclesiastical potentate as superior to
our Government ?"
To you. Mr. Editor, I feel like apologizing for
repeating these questions here, but Father
Yorke's unwillingness to commit himself on
questions of principle renders it necessary.
For two weeks from the time I propounded the
first of my questions I was forced to prod him
before he would even pretend to reply, and 1
am determined, with your permission, to con
tinue the proceeding" until the questions are
answered. Very respectfully,
B. F. HI'DKLSON, .
President of the A. P. A. of California.
A STATEMENT DENIED.
Lionel A. Sheldon Repudiates an
Expression Attributed to Him
by Father Yorke.
The followiug letter is self-explanatory:
Los Angeles, Feb. 17, 180(5.
F.i I nor San Franetico Call: In his paper pub
lished in your issue of the lUth inst. Father
Yorke says that in a speech in Los Angeles I
stated there were arms concealed In the base
ment of the cathedral, and that Mr. Donnegan
produced a certified check for SIOOO and of
fered to pay it if arms were found there.
Bo far as I am concerned the statement is
absolutely false. 1 saw it stated in the papers
that Governor J. J. Gasper did make the state
ment that Father Yorke ascribed to me. I
have never made such a statement anywhere,
and I do not deal in that kind of stuff, nor do
I assail any religious creed or form of worship.
Our principle is that every man may worship
God according: to the dictates of his own con
science. I believe with the great Thomas Jef
ferson, that "error of opinion may be safely
tolerated when reason is left free to combat it."
Please give this a place in your column*. Very
respectfully, Lionel A. Sheldon.
D, Nichols' Denial.
D. Nichols has sent a letter to The Call
in which he denies the truth of certain
statements made with reference to him by
Father Yorke. The statement was that
Mr. Nichols had asserted that large quan
tities of firearms, etc., were beimr stored in
the basement of the Catholic church on
the corner of Eighteenth and Suotwell
streets. Mr. Nichols emphatically denies
that he had ever made such a statement.
THE PUPIL OF YSAYE
Arrival of Richard Ferrer, the
Young California Vio
linist.
Story of His Experiences Abroad.
Will. Give Concerts Here and
Return to Brussels.
Richard Ferrer, the noted young violin
ist of this City who five years ago went
abroad to study, has returned here. His
coming was sudden, not even his friends
expecting him, and was the result of a
sudden determination to see his native
land once more.
During his absence he has been in Ber
lin, Dresden and Brussels. In the former
city he studied under Wirth of the iaruous
Joachim quartet, who is regarded as one
of the finest of foundation teachers.
In Dresden Mr. Ferrer had for his
teacher the renowned Lauterbaen. He re
mained for a long time there.
The last instructor of the young man,
Richard Terror, the Young Violinist Who lias Returned After Five Years in
Europe
and the centleman who yet has the direc
tion of his musical tastes, is the famous
Eugene Ysaye, who charmed the people of
this country with his melodies about a
year ago.
Mr. Ferrer has been living in Brussels
for nearly a year past and going regularly
to Ysaye. He regards him as his perma
nent teacher and on hi9 return to Belgium
will renew work under him.
"My trip abroad has been very pleasant,"
said Mr. Ferrer. "I have, however, had
to work very hard, but this I have in the
main enjoyed. My trip home was owing
to a sudden impulse. 1 had not heen here
for five years and I got anxious 10 see ruy
friends once more.
"1 shall only remain here about three
weeks. Meantime I shall give a few con
certs, one in this City soon and others in
the larger towns near here."
Mr. terrer has been busy during the few
days since his arrival in meeting his many
musical friends, besides the old-time asso
ciates of his youth.
Mardi Gras Aftermath.
In consequence of many requests, the
directors of the Mark Hopkins Institute
of Art have decided to keep the magnifi
cent decorations used at the great Mardi
Gras festival Tuesday night in place to
day and to-night, so that every one may
have an opportunity of inspecting them.
In the evening a choice programme of or
chestral music will be rendered, while the
Nob Hill home of art will be brilliantly
illuminated.

Collis P. Huntingdon.
When Senator Morgan of the Pacific
Railway Committee was grilling Hunting
ton in the investigation that went on in
the Senate Tuesday, and which continues
to-day, it became necessary to ask Collis
how much money he was worth when he
began to amuse himself with the pastime
of building and operating railroads.
Mr. Huntington's answer was amusing,
inasmuch as California is full of people
who have known him since he ran his
hardware-store in Sacrairento before the
war began. His wealth at that time was
not enormous, and oid residents scoff at
the statement that he even enjoyed a com
fortable income. The dispatches that have
appeared in The Caix relative to the mat
ter of the Pacilic railway inspection have
contained a great many of Collis P. Hunt
ington's misrepresentations, but none so
palpably ridiculous and misleading as the
one quoted above.
A well-known San Franciscan, who was
one of the original incorporators of the
Southern Pacific road, was approached on
the matter last night.
"When I read in this morning's Call,"
said he, "that Collis P. Huntingdon had a
million dollars when he began to build
railroads, I readily recalled the time he
refers to, but I do not recall the existence
of anything like a million dollars in the
exchequer of Mr. Huntington. As a mat
ter of fact, Mr. Huntington, Mr. Crocuer,
Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Stanford all together
did not possess $14,000 in cash and prop
erty in Sacramento or anywhere else.
They were associated in hardware and
other business ventures and were not very
well off at the time the railroad scheme
was hatched. They got a good lift from
the Government and the State and then
most all the counties came to their assist
ance. Vast tracts of land were deeded to
then; by the VTOvernruent and they began
building the road through construction
companies which they themselves abso
lutely controlled.
"It was their custom to spread the in
formation broadcast that certain engineer
ing feats cost several times more than they
did. This was doubtless done for the pur
pose of misleading the Government as to
the uifticulties and dangers incident to,
building a road in the West. Their figures
were greatly in excess of the real cost and
were in every possible way misleading.
"I am very familiar with the workings
of the early railroad builders, as I fur
nished the money for a railroad repre
sentative to go to Washington and lobbv
tho Jand grant through. I also supplied
the capital with which to purchase the
stationery for the first meeting of the
board of stockholders of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad. Of course, as a great many
others will testify, I was swamped
later on and compelled to sell out my
stock and retire to leave the road In the
hands of its present owners. It is all bosh
for Huntington to claim that he had a
million dollars or anything like it when he
went into the railroad business, and there
are thousands of men in California who
will recognize the fact that Huntington
lies if he says so."
FREE LABOR BUREAU.
It IV ill Be Removed to Sutter Street
Within Two Weeks.
On March 1 the State Labor Bureau will
be removed from 215 Sansome street to 325
Sutter, between Grant avenue and Stock
ton. Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald has
been contemplating making this change
for some time, but his finances would not
permit, he having exhausted the small
amount of the State's appropriation in the
establishment of the free employment de
partment.
Last fall the banking-houses in the
neighborhood of the present quarters were
apprehensive that in the large crowds of
unemployed men who daily assembled at
the Free Employment Bureau would be
desperate characters who might make a
raid upon the clearing-house next door.
They did not like these crowds assembling
in the money center of the City, and they
were anxious to have the employment bu
reau mo"ed uptown. 4
At that time they were willing to sub
scribe liberally to have the change effected,
but at that time the Labor Commissioner
refused to accept the offers of money, be
lieving that the State Board of Examiners
would make special provision for the
maintenance of his office.
However, the winter passed without a
single overt act being committed and the
bankers' apprehension proved to be with
out foundation. Since then they have
showed little interest in the matter and
very few have assisted in subscribing to
the fund that is necessary to effect the
move. Prominent men, however, have
come to the front ar.d subscribed about
$800. It will cost about $1400 to fit up the
new quarters.
The front rooms will be used as the
women's department. The male depart
ment will be in the rear and reached by a
small alley leading off Stockton place. By
this arrangement the annoyance of crowds
of men on the Sutter-street sidewalk will
be avoided. There will be a larce shed in
the rear of the building where the men
may stay while waiting for work. The
offices and rooms where the statistical
work will be attended to will be in the
second story.
Governor Budd, in a conversation with
the Labor Commissioner recently, stated
that when the next Legislature meets he
will endeavor to secure the enactment of a
law providing for the establishment of
three froe employment offices in the south
ern, middle and northern portions of the
State.
PROTEST FROM BAY VIEW
Residents Object to Mr. Sutro's
Choice of a Pesthouse
Site.
They Say His Object Is to Have It
Located Far Away From His
Own Property.
Residents of the Bay View District are
circulating a protest against the location
of the Pesthouse there. They object to
Mayor Sutro bonding a piece of property
in that section for the purpose of donating
it to the City for Pesthouse purposes, and
they intend to present the protest to the
Board of Supervisors on Monday. Fol
lowing is a portion of the document:
To the Honorable Board of Supervisorsâ-Gex
tlemen": Monday morning, February 17, 1896,
Mayor Sutro took a drive, in company with the
representative of local real estate agents, out
beyond South San Francisco and down into
the pretty little Bay View Valley. The object
of Mr. Sutro's visit was to inspect the site
which these real estate agent-!, as we are in
formed, have bonded for Mr. Sutro, who pro
poses to purchase the property and donate it
to the City for the location of a pesthouse.
â Whether Mr. Sutro drove out Railroad avenue
ur out Sun Bruno avenue does not make much
difference. He had to go over one or the other
routes, and for miles on either road he passed
the humble cottages of hundreds of poor work
ing people, and not one of the residents along ; he
route would have given him a cordial greeting
had they known that he was tryinz to drag
behind him a trail of lepers and smallpox pa
tients and people with loathsome and con
tagious diseases.
After leaving Railroad avenue at Thirty
second avenue south, and goine- thence down
the latter avenue to the bay, he passed scores
of homesâ homes of poor people who had
toiled early and late that they might own the
roofs over their own heads, and yet among
these people and in the midst of a well popu
lated valley, he wishes to locate a pesthouse.
Had he taken the trouble to get out of tte car
riage in which he reclined and stepped onto
the land that he proposes to purchase, he could,
feeble as he is, have almost tossed a stone
through the open door of the nearest residence
to the bloek of land which he wishes to poison
bv planting thereon the germs of virulent and
contagious diseases. .
In his endeavors to prevent the Supervisors
from locating the pesthouse on the AlmshouÃe
Tract, where it would have been near some of
his vacant and inaccessible property, Mayor
Sutro promised to donate to tae City a. suitable
location.
He is accredited with beine the owner of
over 4000 aerosol land in this City and County,
most of it vacant, and a great deal of it being
hills and mountains too steep to ever be util
ized for residence or other purposes, yet in all
his 4000 ucres'of land, covering ninny hun
dreds of blocks and extending over miles of
uninhabited waste, he cannot lind a location
suitable for a pesthousc, hut must needs at
tempt to foist it upon a locality that has been
settled for more than twenty years, aud where
scores of -poor and hardworking people owrft
and live in their own homes.
The location chosen by Mr. Sutro is a gently
sloping bill at the mouth of the valley and
near to the present beach. It commands a
view of the entire valley from Hunter's Point
to Bay View Point and "from Holly Park to the
bay. There are no trees or shrubbery to ob
scure the sight of so foul a plague, and for
miles along the ban Bruno road and along
Railroad avenue, the two great thoroughfares
leading out of the City, this institution would
be visible; and not alone would It retard the
advancement and progress of an already well
populated residence district, but would utterly
destroy the value of such improvements as
have already been made.
Mr. Sutro's motive in offering to donate a
site to the City for a pesthouse apoears to bean
entirely selfish one. The objection that he
urges to the location of a pesthouse on the
Almshouse Tract is that it is me "geographical
center of the City." How much more true it
would be if he would only state that it is the
"geographical center of Mr. Adolrjh Sutro's
landed, estate." Were he actuated by a desire
to honestly provide the City with a suitable
location for a pesthouse it would be a small
matter for him to choose from his many hun
dreds of blocks one block of land hidden in a
ravine or behind a hiil off from the tide of
travel and shut out from sight by sloping hills
too steep to ever be used for residence pur
poses. __________^__

HEART STENOGRAPHYT
A Remarkable Instrument Which
Records in Detail the Move-
ments of the Heart.
STRANGE ACTION OF STIMULANTS.
The Sphygmograph, a Delicate Piece
of Mechanism, Which Writes
What the Heart Dictates.
One of the most intricate and wonderful
little instruments applied in the science
of medicine is the sphygmograph. The
mechanism of this tiny machine is so
minute that it is somewhat difficult to
convey a comprehensive idea of it by
means of a written description. The ac-
companying illustration, however, will
assist the reader in building an ideal
sphygmograph in the mind's eye, and the
study of it will afford a little exercise and
consequent development of the faculty
through which we gain most of our knowl-
edge â perception.
The sphygmograph is an instrument
used to measure and record the action of
the heart, using the pulse as its key. In
other and plainer language, it sketches on
paper, by mean* of a very line point, in
irregular up and down zigzag strokes,
every beat and movement of that great
little blood pump â the heart.
The utility and importance of such an
instrument is readily understood wnen we
remember that the heart's action mani-
fests itself through the pulse. The heart
acts and the pulse exhibits the action, or,
rather, the manner of the action. Tbia
action is perceptible to the touch when we
"leei the pulse," manifesting itself by dif-
ferent degrees of intensity in the pulse-
beat. Thus a strong heart produces a

strong, firm swell or wave in the pulse,
and vice versa.
Tne office of the sphygmograph is to in-
dicate the degree of intensity and regu-
larity of the heartbeat, which performance
is accomplished as follows: The instru-
ment is attached to the wrist by means of
a silk band, thus holding a sensitive disk,
fastened to the band, in juxtaposition with
the. pulse-artery. The pulsations, acting
on this disk, move a pointed marker held
by an armature. up, down and across the
surface of a slip of paper, which is kept
moving by means of a delicate mechanism
within the instrument. In this manner
the irregular tracings, as shown in the cuts
below, are produced and make an accur-
ate stenographic record, as it were, of the
heart movements in health and disease,
excitement and depression. This written

language of the heart is, therefore, a mes-
sage containing a detailed description of
the status of our physique in general, and
heart in particular.
Dr. -F. Woodbury, professor of clinical
medicine at the Medical Chirurgical Col-
lege of Philadelphia, in a recent lecture to
medical students, called attention to a
most important series of these sphygmo-
graphic tracings made by Dr. A. H. P.
Leuf, late director of physical education
at the University of Pennsylvania, which
illustrated in a striking manner the effects
of alcohol and other stimulants upon" the
heart. The illustrations here shown are
adopted from those of Dr. Leuf. Cut No. 1
represents the condition of the pulse in its
normal state.

ratic pulse produced by an ounce of alcohol

or physical â which . follows the use of

reduced to one-third its normal strength.

- pression attendant upon the administra-
t tion of alcohol. When the force of the
drug is spent the pulse gradually decreases
in strength, until its natural strength is
attained. . Tracings taken every fifteen
! minutes for five hours showed that at no
' time was the subject's pulse lower than
â¢ before takine, or lower than normal,
i whereas with alcohol the reaction was so
pronounced, the pulsation so feeble, that
the sphygmographic record of them is a
weak, wavy line, Bhowing scarcely any
movement of the marker.
Dr. Leuf's tracings serve to demonstrate
that alcohol, opium, cocaine, morphine,
etc., are stimulants which merely lend
strength and exact a twofold payment
from nature's reserve forces for the loan.
Therein lies the great drawback in the use
of ulcohol as a stimulant and excitant, ab-
sorbing as it does its stimulant power from
the vital reserve of nature, whereas in the
case of Vino Kolafra the extra amount of
energy is furnished Dy the remedy itself,
molded and eenerated by nature's own
methods. It is merely an addition of fuel
to the ever-burning fire of nature, and
when that addition is consumed the flame
of nature subsides to its normal state, leav-
ing no trace whatever of the transpiring of
any unusual event. This fact is of the
utmost importance, and its value cannot
be overestimated, as it will undoubtedly
have a considerable bearing in the admin-
istration of a stimulant and tonic. Pro-
fessor Woodbury specifically drew the at-
tention of the medical students to it. He
also recommended the value of Vino Ko-
lafra in restoring the nervous system to its
normal condition after an alcoholic de-
bauch, as also for weakness, melancholia,
gastric catarrh and drunkard's dyspepsia,
predicting that "on account of its sustain-
ing and strengthening effects upon the
heart it will be found useful in preventing
heart failure." "It is," he further says,
"the remedy for the muscular pains and
debility following la grippe."
Professor Woodbury notes that his atten-
tion was first called to the products of the
African nut by Dr. A. L. Gihon, Medical
Director of the United States Navy, who,
in treating several cases of sick headache
and others of nervous debility and im-
paired digestion, found the remedy of
decidedly beneficial value; and Dr. Gihon'a
observations were subsequently confirmed
by Dr. A. Hudson, United States Navy, in
a paper published in the Philadelphia
"Medical Times."
Referring to the extensive use of Vino
Kolafra by the athletes of Yale and other
colleges during the past season, Professor
Woodbury saya: "As athletes find it sus-
tains them during their severe muscular
and nervous exercises, it is a fair inference
that in wasting diseases it will similarly
conserve muscular and nervous force."
These remarkable characteristics ex-
hibited in the action of Vino Kolafra
would seem to lend it a distinction in
value far beyond that possessed by any
other stimulant and tonic the merits of
which are known to us. Its application in
sickness and disease will certainly prove a
valuable innovation in the scieuce of medi-
cine.
Much has been said about Vino Kolafra,
and the scientific and indisputable evi-
dence of the sphygmographic tracings as
detailed by Dr. Leuf add only to the cumu-
lative proof of its merits.

CHICAGO, li.u, Feb. 19.â A fair amount of
"long" wheat came on the market this morning.
l"he sales of one house were supposed to be for the
iccourit of a prominent holder, but it was not be
jeved tiiat he parted with more than a moderate
proportion of his holdings. There was selling for
scattered owners and the aggregate made a very
;ood amount. Tbe cold weather lighter North
.vestern rÂ«'Ceipts, 332 cars against 439 last Wednes
lay aud 420 a year ago. were " instrumental in
irming prices at the opening, but it was soon itp-
Mureai that there was more wheat seeking a mar

â¢esuit being a break of about lc. Liverpool cables

,vere 164 cars an d 87,704 bushels were withdrawn
rora store. Export clearances were light at 102,

erally lower. About noon prices recovered the
Drevious loss, early short sellers turning buyers.
Large sales of cash wheat at New York and
'hiCHgo inspired the strength. It was said that ]
iOO.OOO bushels were taken at the former place
and 200.000 bushels at the latter. May wheat
jpened from 67i>i to 65V8C sold between 65."V8

opening of the corn market, the motive for which

to break in sympathy with the liiiiiini; market, a
moderate loss taking place. Receipts were 354

Dr. Harmon of San Leandro
a Sadder but Wiser
Husband.
CAUGHT WITH HIS COIN.
Thirty Thousand Dollars Was
Packed in His Va
lise.
OBJECTED TO PAYING ALIMONY.
Cleverly Arrested on the Eve of
Making His Escape to
Victoria.
Oaklaxp Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway. Feb. 19. i
Dr. L. C. Harmon, of San Leandro dis
tributed about $-21,000 about his person last
evening, and intended that by to-night he
would be well on his waj T to Victoria, B.
C, beyond the punishment of American
civil law. Instead, however, he is still in
Ban Francisco and $L'o,ooo of his money is
in the possession of the Superior Court of
Alameda County. The failure of the doc
tor's plans constitute a sensational chapter
in the proceedings ol a divorce suit, insti
tuted some time ago.
The Harmons lived at San Leandro,
where they have a beautiful home. But
all the beauty is outside. Within the do
mestic life was a travesty on the word
home. Mrs. Harmon declared that she
was very frequently the victim of extreme
MRS. HARMOX, THE DOCTOR'S WIFE, WHO IS SEEKING A DIVORCE.
[From a photograph.]
cruelty, and when she could stand it no
longer she wanted to be free. Incidentally
she asked the court for attorneys' fees, a
division of property and permanent ali
mony. At the first hearing in the case Dr.
Harmon was ordered to pay his wife $100
a month. For the last month he has dis
obeyed the court and so he was served
with an order yesterday to appear in court
this morning and show cause why he
should not be punished for his contempt.
Dr. Harmon and his wife present a
strange contrast. He is a physical de
formity ti. rough acute spinal ataxia. His
hearing and speech are so far impaired
tnat he can communicate only by signs
and in writing. He also stoops considera
bly, and is about 40 years of age.
Mrs. Harmon is several years yonneer
than her husband and is a very attractive
woman. She is of medium stature and is
extremely ladylike in her demeanor. She
married the doctor nine years ago, and
they have one child.
Far several d;iys Mrs. Harmon has been
BUSDicioofl that her husband was not anx
ious to live up to the order of the court,
and that he intended, if possible, to leave
the State. She communicated her fears to
her attorney, \V. W. Foote, and a detec
tive was set to watch the ban Leandro
doctor. He has been livincr at the St.
Nicholas Hotel in San i- rancisco. He
lias not been practicing for some years, as
he is wealthy and is known to possess
The Sfcamcr City of Puebla, on Which Dr. Harmon Was to Sail for Victoria, B. C, the Tug Millie,
Which Was to Put Him Aboard, and the Whitehall Boat That Was to Intercept the Tug.
more than $30,000, and probably twice j
that amount.
( Detective Hierlihy joon discovered that j
t.ie doctor had a handy man as a valet. J
His name is E. Ellsworth, ana he was con- !
Btantly with his master.
While watching the doctor the detective I
excited the suspicion of Officer Bode and
was taken to the station.
In explanation of his presence outside i
the house he said that Dr. Harmon was '
inside and the doctor was trying to evade
service of a suhpena to appear in Judge |
Frick's court in the morning in a divorce i
suit instituted by his wife. He and the j
other detective were watching for him to ,
serve him with the subpena as he intended |
leaving the city.
Captain Gillin telephoned to Captain \
Swain of the Oakland police and was in- |
formed that the private detective's story
was true, so he was at once released and
Sergeant Martin and party were notified to
quit the espionage of the house.
How the two came togetheris not known
at present, as neither of them is inclined
to give his secrets away. Last night the i
detective noticed that Ellsworth left the j
hotel and made a circuitous route to the j
water front. He went into the saloon of ;
Al White, where he met a man, evidently |
by appointment. The conversation was all i
about a tug and the speed of the steamer j
City of Puebla, which was to leave for i
Victoria at 9 o'clock this morning. Ells
worth asked about the tug Millie, which
brings The Call to Oakland, and told his
companion that he had a friend who had
any amount of money, and who was mixed
up in a divorce suit ana wanted to get out
of the State.
The conversation was heard by the de
tective and communicated to Mrs. Har
mon's attorney. Then a plan was laid to
outwit the doctor. Sam Kuddell of the
revenue sen-ice was brought into the mat
ter and requested to hold the Government
tug in readiness in case Dr. Harmon should
get off shore. Then a warrant was aworn
out for the arrest of the doctor.
Some days ago Dr. Harmon wrote to his
wife. He used some language that might
be construed as vulgar. Mrs. Harmon
might not have paid any attention to it,
but when something had to be done to
hold her husband from fleeing with his
fortune a warrant was sworn out.
At 2:30 o'clock this morning Captain
Wittman of the Central police station at
San Francisco was notiiied from this city
to arrest Dr. Harmon, who had left the
water front in a buggy. The captain got a
description of the doctor and the rig and
was informed that the doctor had $30,000
wit!, him, which the captain was to hold
as evidence ncainst the doctor.
Captain Wittman ordered Policeman
Sullivan tj change bin coat and accompany
him and they both hurried from the sta
tion. At Market and Sixth streets the
captain met the buggy, and, told Ells-
, worth, the valet, who was driving, to stop.
Ellsworth drove on, and, the captain,
drawing his revolver, commanded Ells
. worth again to pull up, otherwise he would
have to take the consequences, and it had
the desired effect.
Behind the buggy occupied by Dr. Har
mon and Â£Ilsworth there was another
buggy in which a private detective was
seated, who had followed close after the
other all the wa^ r from the ferry.
The captain led the horse to the Central
station, and there, in the bottom of the
buggy, were found two revolvers loaded in
every chamber. The doctor and Ellsworth
were taken to the captain's room and Oak
land was notified of the arrest. He re
ceived instructions to hold the doctor and
a detective would cross over for him by
the first boat.
The doctor admitted that he was trj-ing
to escape to Victoria. He said lie had
lived happily witb his wife till he was
seized with a deadly spinal disease and
now she wanted to get rid of him. He had
only a few years to live and he wanted to
get away somewhere to end his last years
in peace and quietness.
The case Mas called in Judge Frick's
court this morning and Attorney Foote
called all the detectives.who told the story
of last night's escapade. He asked that a
receiver be appeinted and Judge Frick ap
pointed Emif Nusbaumer as receiver.
Dr. Harmon went outside the courtroom
with Detective Holland, and then de

livered up a roll of notes that he had
secreted about his underclothing. It was
worth $16,000. This, with $4595 found in
the doctor's valise, was considered by the
court a sufficient sum to cover any possible
judgment that the wife might obtain, and
Harmon was released. He was again
arrested and taken to the City Prison on
the misdemeanor warrant, but after put
tine up $100 cash bail he was again at
liberty, and returned with Ellsworth to

THE SYNDICATE SCHEME
Project for the Alameda Library
Building Progress
ing.
Inquest Over the Body of Lena Nel
son, the Youthful Girl '
Suicide.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 19.â F. W. Van
Sicklen of the Citizens' Committee reports
great progress with the scheme of forming
the syndicate to build a library building
for the city. He has had numerous offers
from interested citizens, who desire to
contribute sums of money and become
stockholders in the syndicate, but he says
that at present it is bis desire to secure
only subscribers who will advance $1000,
and he wants ten of them. He has so far
secured six of the ten. After getting the
other four he intends to call upon those
who will give the smaller amounts until
the necessary f 1:0,000 is raised.
The proposition of the syndicate is a
simple one. It wili lease from the city the
library lot at the southwest corner of Oak
Street and Santa Clara avenue, erect a suit
able building costing $20,000 thereon, and
in turn lease the building to the library
trustees. The terms of the lease of the
building to the library trustees will be for
a rental equal to 5 per centum on the sum
invested, with the condition that the city
may at any time purchase the building
during the life of the lease for the actual
cost of construction.
There lias been some question as to the I
legality of this proceeding, but the ques- !
tion was submitted to City Attorney !
Taylor and George H. Mastick on behalf j
of the library trustees, and they have both '
declared that the plan can be legally and
successfully carried out without loss.
Board of Education.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 19.â The Board
of Education met last night and the prin
cipal matter brought before it for discus- I
sion_ was the appointment of a census
marshal. Superintendent Sullivan called
attention to the fact that the school census
marshal must oe chosen before the Ist of
April, and that the law only allows the
appointment of the marshal, making no
j provision for assistants. The census
marshal himself must appoint his depu
; ties. Tha board has reason to remember
| the experience with Edward McFadden,
[ who was brought before the Grand Jury
I and indicted ior falsifying the census re
turns of last year, but subsequently ac
quitted because not appointed by the
proper authority. It will consider the !
appointment this year deeply and en- !
deavor to avoid a repetition of the past
scandal. J. L. Ballentine has already put
In an application for the position.

ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. I!).â An inquest

son, who committed suicide on Tuesday |
night at the residence of her employers I
Mr. aud Mrs. R. 8. Clark of Alameda
avenue. Her sister and brother made dep
ositions, but threw no light on the motive
for the act. According to the sister she
had admitted having made an attempt at
suicide about three months ago, and had
gone so far as to place the strychnine to

she dropped the glass. The verdict was

MERCHANTS SURPRISED
Result of Treasury Agent Har
ris' Recent Visit to
Oakland.
CONFEDERATE NOTE "ADS."
Standing in Line for Hours to Secure
Scats to Hear Paderewski
Play.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 19. \
Treasury Agent Harris created a sur
prise in this city yesterday by notifying
several merchants that their method of
advertising was contrary to law. tor sev
eral weeks the sidewalks have been freely
covered with folded sreenbacks. "When
the finder would pick them up he would,
on unfolding it, be speedily made aware of
the fact that the supposed greenback wa3
an advertisement.
The greenback was a fac-simile of a
Confederate note, promising, two years
after the signing of a treaty of peace be
tween the Confederacy and the United
States, to pay the sum for which the note
was drawn. The note was invariably
folded so that the eye could see what it
was, and very few were left on the side
walk more than a few minutes. The ruse
proved a good one and several firms were
soon using it.
Agent ilarris came to Oakland yester
day, found out the people who were using
them and then warned them to desist, as
j the practice was against the law. This
i occasioned great surprise, because the
I notes were not representations of United
: States money and were merely Confederate
I "shin-plasters." The agent, however,
! quoted the law which he said forbade the
using of notes as an advertising medium.
He alfao referred to a case in whicn a
! doctor up north had been fined $100 for
1 persisting in using the notes after being
warned to desist.
"We intend to respect the -warning of
the agent," said J. W. Layraance, one of
the enjoined advertisers, "but I have been
told that if we were to persist we could
continue to use them. We have no time
or inclination to make a fight, and will call
all our currency in."
THE NAIL WORKS.
i Preparations to Keg time Work With
I>ay ami >"ig;ht Shifts.
OAKLAND, Cat,., Feb. 19.â The old nail
1 works at the foot of Filbert street, which
, have been leased by the Biddle Purchas-
I ing Company ol Philadelphia, made the
I first nail to-day under the new manage
ment. J. C. Maloney came out here about
j two weeks ago and Monday put a force of
; men at work cleaning the place up and
; putting it into condition for operation.
â  Harry Veirs, who was with the old corn
â  pany for many years, has been appointed
; foreman, and William Wilson and William
! Uassner, twe skilled mechanics of Cleve
; land, Ohio, arrived to-day. They will rush
j the work of putting the machines in work-
I ing order.
The intention is to draw the wire on the
i premises and manufacture nails from
j those used in cigar-boxes and shoes to the
I sixty-penny naii. There will be two shifts
and the plant kept running day and night.
The day force will work from 7 a. m. to
â¢6 r. m. The night force will be on the
| other thirteen hours. No stops will be
: made for meals, as the men can lunch
j while the automatic machines are at work.
| It is expected that 100 men will be em-
I ployed, but it will be a week or ten days
i before things will be in such shape that
I the twenty machines can be put to work.
The company running the plant lias
j factories at Cleveland, Ohio; Joliet, 111.;
I Charleston, W. Va. Some thirty or more
: men, old and young, were hanging about
the place to-day in hopes of securing work.
None of the machines will be put to work
until all are ready. There arc about a
dozen employed getting things into shape.
FIXING WATER RATES.
Water Companies Seemingly Take but
Kiltie Interest This Year.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 19.â President
Manuel of the City Council selected Coun
cilmen Towle, Mott and Buckland a
special committee upon water rates. They
are at work on an ordinance which is to
be presented to the Council at the meeting
next Monday. The framing and passing
| of a water-rate ordinance is the chief event
in the Council each year, and the pull
which is called into exercise is tremend
ous, but there was little sign of it last
I year, and, to judge from appearances,
neither water company is troubling itself
this year about the rates which the Coun
cil may establish, though both will make
the usual motions of a fight by sendinc
! attorneys to arcue before the Council"
! The reason for the indifference is that
both companies are selling water below
the legally established rates, and they ex
pect to continue doing so. It is generally
I believed that the committee will recom
mend an ordinance substantially the same
as that now in force.
WAITED FOR HOURS.
Paderewski's Concert Will Be a Marked
Success.
OAKLAND, Cat-., Feb. 19.â For three
ho urs before daylight this morning there
Was a line of people reaching from the
Macdonougii entrance around o:i Broad
way, patiently waiting for the box-office
to open so that they could purchase Feats
for Paderewski'a concert on Saturday
night. There was some struggling to get
to the front of the line and it was neces
sary to ser.d for an officer to keep the
peace. Promptly at 0 o'clock the box
oiiice window was thrown up and the sale
commenced.
From the general character of those who
purchased tickets it is very evident that
| the theater will present a very swell ap
pearance. Coachmen ware in line to pur
chase for their masters; many people
prominent in society nwule their own se
lections, and Fome bright boys who had
got there early were able to sell their po
sitions at a paying rate. By 2 o'clock
$3000 had been passed through the win
dows ivid over one-half of the house had
been sold. There are still some choice
seats left, but the rate continues brisk.
Garrity in Court.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 19. âAttorney
Thomas F. Garrity appeared before Judge
Wood of the Police Court this morning for
the first time since his commitment by
that official for contempt of court. He de
sired to have a Chinese opium-selling case
go over so as to have a San Francisco at
torney appear in the case with him Jud"e
Wood denied the request, as the case has
been repeatedly postponed at the request
of the attorney, but he set it for to-morrow
at 10:30 instead of 9:30 o'clock, so that At
torney Garrity could be present at the ha
beas 'corpns proceedings in his behalf in
the Superior Court. The attorney will be
represented in these by Attorneys Chap
man, Bradley and Walsh. The people
will be represented by Assistant District
Attorney Church and Attorneys Reed and
Nusbaumer. The latter are confident that
there is nothing in the point raised by
Garrity's representatives.
He Surprised Them.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Feb. 10.â Officer Lay
tou of the North. Oakland beat rides a
bicycle when on duty and this fact nearly
led to the capture of three burglars yester
day morning. Heretofore the officer of
that beat has ridden a large white horse,
which could be heard and seen a long way
off. This was always a caution to evil
doers to lay low. This time the officer
was nearly on his men before the lookout
saw him and gave the signal to make off.
He saw them and called on them to stop,
but they slipped away from him. He
emptied his revolver at the fleeing forms
without effect. It was found they had en
tered a bakery and removed a small
square of glass from the showcase and
were helping themselves So tobacco, cigars,
etc., when scared away. There is not the
least clew as to who the guilty ones were.

PIETRO GOBI'S TALK.
A Female Socialist Presides at the
Anarchist's Lecture.
Mrs. A. Gaffe, an ardent lady socialist,
presided last night at Pietro Gori'a lecture
in Apollo Hall, which was addressed espe
cially to women.
In introducing the anarchist, Mrs. Gaffe
spoke strongly aeainst modern conditions,
saying:
'â¢Our children demand from us another
neritage than that of slavery, Let us, the
mothers of families, try to-day to crush
the head of this serpent of selfish capital
ism."
IMetro Oori commenced his address by
his usual spirited denunciation of the ex
isting state of society, in which he said,
â¢'The mother must think of the black to
morrow when bread is not assured to her
children," but he cheered his hearers by
alluding to the time when the workmen
shall have conquered their places at tne
banquet of life.
Pietro Gori denied repeatedly and
emphatically that anarchism desires to
abolish tne family, but he scoffed at the
present marriage laws as being too ridicu
lous to be worth considering. "Ah! they
sav that we want to destroy the family.
Does a family exist for a man who toils
twelve or fourteen hours a day, as they
often do in Europe? The family of such
a toiler is a heavier burden than he can
bear."
The speaker dwelt at length and in
scathing terms on the modern system of
marriage, wb'ich he said had come to be
looked upon merely as a loveless commer
cial contract. There was a large audience.
Gori's views, which at times were very
revolutionary, received warm applause.

A NATURAL "UNCLE SAM."
He Will Figure in the Oakland
Parade on Washington's
Birthday.
TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN.
Regatta in the Afternoon and Pa
triotic Exercises at
Night.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 19. j
One of the features of the Washington's
birthday parade win be Oakland's natural
'"lincle Sam." The man who so closely
resembles the being used in common by
caricaturists to represent the Nation is
C. W. Cornor, for many years a resident of
this city. Isext Saturday he will be seated
on a float and take the place in the pro
cession for which nature has so well fitted
him.
"Uncle Sam" Cornor, as the gentleman
is known all over Oakland, possesses other
claims than his features for figuring on
this particular Washington's birthday. He
was born in the State of Maine on the 22d
of February, 1826. Consequently he has
just reached the limit of three score and
ten years.
The many floats that will figure in the
parade and the various fraternal -societies
that will be in line have been already pub
lished. It is now estimated that the en
tire parade will be over an hour passing a
given point.
The committee in charge of the exer
cises at the Congregational church have
decided upon the following programme:

UNIVERSITY POLITICS.
Sophomores Preparing for the Klection
of Their iilne and Gold. Officergâ Se
ries of Services at St. Mark'ti,
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 19.â College
politics is again interesting the students at
Berkeley. President Dorn of the sopho
more class has called a meeting of the '98
men for next Friday afternoon, at â¢which it
expected that the "Blue and Gold" officers
for the next year will be nominated. The j
question as to how the election will be car
ried on will also come up. Some hot dis
cussion is expected on this point. Presi
dent Dorn favors the assembly system, to i
expedite matters and to prevent jobbery, !
while a large proportion of the class wishes
the ballot system.
Those who have announced themselves
as candidates for the editorship are Steele,
Chickering, Hector and i)ickie. The can
didates for business manager are Baker
and Meade. All of the aspirants, with the
exception of Rector, who is a "non-frat"
man, are members of different Greek let
ter societies, and, as a consequence, the
election will bring forth a more or less
animated fraternity light.
Subject for the Intercollegiate.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 19.â The com
mittee, consisting of seven professors and
students, appointed by the forensics class,
to prepare a question for the coming
annual debate between the University of
California and Stanford, reached a deci
sion to-day.
At the recent meeting of the intercolle
giate executive committee the University
of California won the choice of subject and
Stanford the choice of sides. Now that
Berkeley has decided upon the subject all
that remains is for Stanford to choose their
side, after which the preliminaries in both
I colleges will be held. The following will
I be the subject:
I "Resolved, That article I, section 3,
: clause 1, of the constitution of the I'nited
I States be amended so as to read, 'The
i Senate of the United States shall be com
'â  posed of five Senators from each State,
! chosen by the people thereof, and the
j electors of each State shall have qualifica
i tions requisite for electors of the House of
; Representatives.' Each Senator to be
I chesen for six years and to have one vote.
"And that part of article I, section 3,
clause 2, which refers to the filling of va
i cancies in the Senate, should be amended
| so as to read, 'And if vacancies happen, by
! resignation or otherwise, tliey shall be
tilled in the same manner as vacancies in
the House of Representatives.' "
The students' congress debated the sub
ject extemporaneously at their meeting to
night.
The intercollegiate will be held on the
| evening of April IS, in San Francisco.

A ROBBER ARRESTED.
One of the Men Who Held Up Mrs.
Blnrble Identified.
William McDonald, a Bernal Heights
"tough," 26 years of age, was arrested last
night by Corporal Sheehan and Policemen
McKenna and Thompson and booked at
the Seventeenth-street station on the
charge of robbery.
Mrs. C. J. Marble, who has a milk ranch
on the San Bruno road, was driving home
from the City on the ni^ht of February 12,
when she was held up by two footpads,
who compelled her at the point 01 a re
volver to Hand over to them $25, all the
money she had In her possession.
She notified the police at the Seven
teenth-street station, giving a good de
scription of the two men. Suspicion fell
upon McDonald, and after he was arrested
Mrs. Marble was notified. She drove to
the station and at once identified Mc-
Donald.
NEW TO-DAY.
Gladness Comes
With a better understanding of the
Â» * transient nature of the many phys-
ical ills, which vanish before proper ef-
forts â efforts â pleasant efforts â
rightly directed. There is comfort in
the knowledge, that so many forms of
sickness are not due to any actual dis-
ease, but simply to a const ipa ted condi-
tion of the system, which the pleasant
family laxative, Syrup of Figs, prompt-
ly removes. That is why it is the only
remedy with millions of families, and is
everywhere esteemed bo highly by all
who value good health. Its beneficial;
effects are due to the fact, that it is the
one remedy which, promotes internal
cleanliness without debilitating the
organs on which it acts. It is therefore
all important, in order to get its bene-
ficial effects, to note when you pur-
chase, that you have the genuine arti-
cle, which is manufactured by the Cali-
fornia Fig Syrup Co. only and sold by
all reputable druggists.
If in the enjoyment of good health,
and the system is regular, laxatives or
other remedies are then not needed. If
afflicted with any actual disease, one
may be commended to the most skillful
physicians, but if in need of a laxative,
one should have the best, and with the
well-informed everywhere, Syrup of
Figs stands highest and is most largely
used and gives most general satisfaction.

SAID TO BE HEALTHFUL
Expert Analyst's Report on San
Francisco's Water
Supply.
LONGFELLOW SCHOOL CLOSED.
Condemned by the Board of Health.
Filthy Marin County Milk
Ranches.
The Board of Health considered the re
ports of the experts employed to analyze
and examine the waters of the various
lakes from which the Spring Valley Com
pany supplies this Citv yesterday.
As stated exclusively in The Cu.r. the
reports were very favorable to the water
and Professor Wenzell, the analytical
chemist, stated that in his opinion the
vrator was entirely fit for drinkinc pur
poses and that the quality of the water,
has greatly improved pince the reports of
tlie company were submitted in 18f>4.
An interesting phase of the matter was
the portion of the report referring to the
aeration of water It was inferred from
the results attained that this process
vastly improves the fluid, destroying cer
tain objectionable matter and .adding
others that improve the water.
The difference in the foreign water in
the waters of the various lakes between
In4 and the present was shown hy the fol
lowing table submitted by Professor Wen
zell:

The report of Professor Wenzell was
borne out by that of Professor Rising, the
State analyst, and others who investigated
the m;ttUT.
Dr. J. C. Spencer, the bacteriologist of
the board, reported that he had given the |
samples submitted to him a careful micro- j
Ecopical examination, and had not found
anything that would menace tlie public '
health. He had found colonies of bacteria,
but they were of the kind found in all
water as a result of decaying vegetable
matter.
In the samples from Lake Merced and ;
the Clarendon Heights and University !
Mound reservoirs an unusual number of j
colonies were found, though not of a dan- ;
gerous kind. Dr. bpencergave his opinion
that with the exception oi that contained :
in the reservoirs mentioned the water sup
plied to San Francisco is of excellent
quality.
" It was recommended by Professor Wen-
Bell that the coverings of the reservoirs be
removed to give the air more chance to
purify the water.
At the close of the reading of there
port?. Dr. Morse moved that the reports
be adopted and the suggestions contained ;
be carried out. Mayor Sutro objected to
such action on the "ground that he had
not had time to examine the reports and
that he desired to see that oi Professor j
Price, who was employed by him, before
coming to any conclusion.
He asked that the matter be deferred ]
until next Wednesday and that a special
meeting be i-alled to pass on the subject.
Dr. Morse consented to this arrangement.
The sanitary condition of the Longfellow
School then came up. Dr. Hart declared
that as the matter now stands the lives of
thousands of school children are endan-
gered and tbat the board should do sonie
thmK to prevent an epidemic of scarlet
fever or diphtheria from gaining a foot
hcld in the City.
He said tbat the Supervisors had given
the committee that called on them little
satisfaction and that there was little like
lihood of relief from that Quarter.
He moved that the Longfellow School
be condemned and closed until such time
as the Board ot Supervisors or Board of
Education should place it in pood sani
tary condition. The motion was carried,
and the Board of Education will be noti
fied to close the school at once. The Rin
con School, which adjoins the Longfellow,
will also probably be closed.
It is believed that the suspension will be
of short duration, as the School Directors
are already laying plans for the immediate
changing of the system.
Milk Inspector 'Dockery reported that be
bad visited the dairies of Marin County
and found them in a most indescribably
filthy condition. Though ne has no juris
diction over them, he expressed it as his
opinion that he could prevent t:.eir milk
from- coming into this City unless they
kept their dairies as the local law requires
of San Francisco dairymen.
Dockery on the Front.
Milk Inspector Dockery was hard at
work yesterday and created a sensation bv
gathering in a large quantity of milk be
low standard. People stood around in
amazement, as can after can of the con
demned commodity was dumped into the
bay. Dockery says tbat be is determined
to follow up his duty of suppressing the
adulteration of miik wherever he tinusit.
WITHDREW ONE CHARGE
Beginning of the Investigation
of Principal Joseph
O'Connor.
It May Be That the Matter Will
Never Come Before the Board
of Education.
The Committee on Rules of the Board of
Education decided last evening to hear the
testimony of witnesses before deciding
whether Principal James O'Connor is to
be tried before the open board on the
charges recently preferred by School Di
rector Henderson, or whether the matter
is to be dropped. This conclusion was ar
rived at after considerable feeling had been
displayed on both sides and sharp words
spoken on both sides.
Director Comte opened proceedings by
stating that the committee had not met to
hold a trial, but simply to learn from
Principal O'Connor's accuser whether it
â¢was worth while to take up the time of the
board with a trial. Tu this end Mr. Hen
derson was asked how he gained his in
formation, and whether it was through
hearsay.
"I decline to answer," he said. "It is
nobody's business but my own."
The committee looked astonished and
Superintendent Babcock asked: "Is it not
a fact that you went among the homes of
the pupils and tried to rind those who were
opposed to the principal?"
Again Mr. Henaerson refused to answer,
and Mr. Comte said that if he had done
such a thing the committee had a right to
know it. Then the charges were taken up.
Mr. Hendenon was asked whether he was
certain of the language used. Ke answered
that he could not be quite sure that Mr.
O'Connor had used the words, "Get yez to
your rooms," but was certain that the
principal had compared the children to
Digger Indian?.
Then the second and more serious charge
was taken up and Mr. Henderson was
asked wno gave him the informa ion on
which he based his accusation that Mr.
O'Connor was an untit person to conduct
the school.
"I decline to answer," was all that Mr.
Henderson would say.
"'ihen what are you here for?" asked
Director Comte with ?ome warmth. "You
make serious accusations against an em
ploye of this department and then refuse
to aid us in finding out the truth of the
matter. This committee is not iroing to
be bulldozed, though Mr. Henderson
seems to be trying that operation. If this
is to go on I am ready to report that there
is nothing in the charges, and that it is
useless to bother the board with them."
"As a matter of fact." put in Mr. Bab
cock, "you have been draanetting the
neighborhood of the school and trying to
tind pupils who have been disciplined by
Mr. O'Connor to testify against him, have
you not?"
Mr. Hen -arson denied tlie charge and
after talking in a disjointed way about the
principals character in the past suddenly
announced that he would withdraw the
hist charge and only insist on tho charge
that the principal hr.d used improper
language.
When Mr. O'Connor was sworn he denied
everything contained in the charges ex
oopt that he had compared the pupils to
Digger Indians.
"They were noisy and unruly," said Mr.
O'Connor, "and I told them that their con
duct was a discredit to their parents, the
school and themselves. I also said that
their manners were worse than those of
Digger Indians, not rellecting upon their
parents or bringing up, but merely on
their actions at that moment."
It was decided to hear testimony as to
other words attributed to the principal by
Mr. Henderson and both were instructed
to be on hand with their witnesses at 8
o'clock next Monday evening.
BROKE UP THE BAND.
â  Desperate San Luis Obispo Cattle
8 Thieves Brought to
Book.
Sheriff Ballou's Story of a Formidable
Gang of Robbers Who Posed
as Farmers.
Sheriff S. D. Ballou of San Luis Obispo
County arrived here last night, having in
charge Hjalmer Petersen, one of a notori-
I ous band of cattle thieves infesting San
; Luis Obispo County for a longtime. Peter
sen has been sentenced to State prison for
seven years.
"The band has made its headquarters
mainly in the northwest corner of San
Luis Obispo," said Sheriff Ballou, who is
at the Grand. "It is a large band and has
been operating there for ten or twelve
years. They have become very formidable,
and the cattle-owners there and others had
become afraid of them. The thieves would
steal the cattle in numbers all the way up
from one to twenty. They drove them to |
Templeton, San Luis Obispo and other j
places and sold them to butchers. They
would also steal wheat by the wagon-load,
haul it to a mill and exchange it for flour,
and then divide up. as they did with the
proceeds of the cattle-stealing.
"The thieves have been living at vaiious
places in the mountains. Some of them
are married and have nice families. They
usually have a little patch of cleared ground
arouiut their houses, so they can raise
\ a little hay, but it is all a blind," for the real I
| business is stealing. The organization has j
| been very complete, with many ramifica
! tions, and they all stood in together.
â¢â¢When I went into office different cat
â  tle-owners complained to me that they
I had lost cattle, and that they knew who
i stole them. I told them I "wanted the
proof, and I reported the names of the
' complainants to the Grand Jury. They
1 were called and testified to the alleged j
I facts and indictments were found.
I arrested nine of them altogether;
and the evidence is so straight that several
of them have pleaded guilty in order to
get as light sentences as possible. The
others will surely be found guilty. Two
young fellows, members of the band, have
fled the State.
"The band is now broken up. It was
one of the most desperate organizations
ever known in the State, but fright has
overcome its members now. I think the
j farmers and others who have suffered from
I their long-continued depredations will suf
! fer no more."
THEY WANT GOOD STREETS,
Knthusiaatic Meeting of tho Point Lobos
Improvement Club.
People in Richmond seem resolved upon
having passable streets, though they are
apparently having a deal of trouble in
bringing their resolutions to the desired
culmination. Last night the Point Lobos
Improvement Club held a meeting in
Mohrman's Hall, on Fifth avenue, near
Clement street, and decided to refer a
number of their grievances to the Mayor,
the Board of Supervisors and the Superin
tendent of Streets.
George R. Fletcher occupied the chair,
and after calling the meeting to order
asked for the views of those present in re
lation to tbe proposed improvement of the
roadways. Luke liattie?, chairman of the
committee on the First-avenue boulevard,
reported that his committee had arrived
at an understanding with the Presidio
Heights Improvement Club, and tliat
henceforth both organizations would work
in harmony.
Some discussion ensued as to the re
numbering of certain of the streets, tile
present system bein â¢ considered rather
! confusing, but no action was taken.
A resolution wai adoptei calling the at
tention of the authorities to the crossings
at the intersection of California street with
Second, Third and Fourth avenues. It
was sai-1 that these crossings are prac
tically impassable even for light vehicles.
A committee was also appointed to confer
with his Honor the Mayor in reference to
the state of Point Lobos avenue between
Thirty-third and Thirty-seventh avenues.
Since the Sutro road w'as laid this part of
the avenue has been much cut up, and the
residents are desirous of seeing it put in
proper condition. An effort will also bo
made for the running of cars on the road
at more frequent intervals, particularly in
the early morning and evening, as work
ingmen are now delayed sometimes as long
as twenty minutes waiting for a car.
The matter of sidewalks in Central
avenue will also be referred to the Super
intendent of Streets, as well as the condi
tion of Sixth avenue. On the latter thor
oughfare there is said to be a great lack of
paving between the tracks, some blocks be
ing rendered well-nigh uninhabitable by
reason of the sand blowing about almost
constantly.
Alter the regular meeting of the club,
the executive committee held a brief ses
sion. I. S. Green was elected a member in
piace of T. G. Parker, who has removed
from the district, aud Luke Battles was
elected cnairman. The committee decided
to accompany Mr. Fletcher to tbe cham
bers of the Board of Supervisors to-day in
order to aid him in presenting a statement
of tlie needs of the district to the proper
authorities.
The Story of King Arthur.
The special committee on a course of free
lectur.es appointed by the Board of Education

teachers of the department will be given by

streets, to-morrow evening at 8 o'clock. The
subject of the lecture will be "The Ktorv of

GRAND ARMY MEN
ARE UP IN ARMS
Old Soldiers Aroused Over
the Yountville Man
agement.
A CALL TO THE STATE.
Governor Budd Asked to Inves
tigate Charges Against
the Directors.
SOME SERIOUS ACCUSATIONS.
Lyon Post of Oakland Leads in a
Movement That Will Arouse the
Entire Coast.
Oakland Office Pan Frakcbco CaxxJ
908 liroadway, Feb. 1!Â». >
â Whereas, It is alleged and believed by many
Grand Army men and others:
Firstâ Tnat the board of directors of the Vet
eran!-' Home at Yountville have for along
time pai'i n salary oi .-<<>(Kt a year to one of
Uieir number as treasurer of the Veteran's
Home Association when the by-lawa of the as
>in state that no director or member
shall receive any compensation for services
rendered the home.
secondâ That the treasurer hns now under
his control over Â£ - _!<>,tMH) of pension money be
longing to veteran! at the home, and receives
rly ior the use of the home more ihnn
$11,000 from the State and about $14,000
from the I'nited Statt-s, while his bond, the
cost of which is paid to the Surety Company,
is only $10,000.
Thirdâ That the directors maintain an office
in San Francisco at an annual expense of about
jj4(K>o, whirh is supported from funds fur
nished by the Stale and National governments
6olely for tiie maintenance of indigent anil do
ubled soldiers, and where no business is trans
uded that could not be done at the home with
out extra charge, as customary in State insti
tutions.
Fourthâ That the directors have lately reno
vated and furnished live of the best rooms at
the home for their private use, at a cost of
about and paid the bills for these im
provement* with money appropriated for the
old soldiers, many of whom are uncomfortably
domiciled and in want of conveniences.
Fifthâ That the directors maintain ami sanc
tion a saloon at the home, where whisky,
brandy, gin and other intoxicating drink* are
Â»-old to members and civilians, when the by
laws of the association say that 'No alcoholic
or distilled liquors shall be sold upon the
prounds controlled by rhe association or in any
building upon the grounds."
.-isthâ That the directors carry wines and
liquors upon the home premises at will, keep
the same in their private rooms, visit the
hospital dispensary early and often for free
drinks, and allow themselves to be seen on the
grounds in a state of intoxication, when their
own rules forbid members of the home to visit
Fftloons or other drinking places within two
miles of the home grounds, to buy or accept
intoxicating: drinks within said two miles, to
bring such drinks upon the grounds or into
the buildings thereon, or in any way become
intoxicated, under penalty of discharge from
the home.
Seventhâ That the directors have constructed
6C-wers which lend from more than twenty
buildings and carry daily about 10,000 gallons
of filth into a branch of Napa Cruet a short
distance above the domestic water supply of
the City of Napa. scattering seeds of disease
and deam among hundreds of families.
Kiphthâ That the directors habitually favor
personal friends in business matters concern
ing the home, to the great detriment of the
home interests, as in the painting of the build
ings last summer, vrhen a certain comrade of
George H. Thomas Post was appointed super
intendent ami paid $4 50 per day, with board;
â while the hard-working contractor and his
men received but $150 a day and boardâ the
superintendent's wages amounting to more
than 60 per cent of the contract price of (870,
and his duties being fo light that several mem
bers of the home better qualified than him-
Fe'f would gladly have performed them
at the rate of $10 a month; and also, in
the matter of supplies, when a director who
buys largely for the home was able to sell his
prune crop of 18.94 direct to the home at the
highest market price, and to get his last year's
< rop into the home through the firm having
the contract to furnish that article â the former
transaction being a criminal offense; and this
partiality is further shown in the erection of
the two large buildings approaching comple
tion on the home grounds to .be paid for chiefly
with funds appropriated only for the mainten
ance of the veteransâ the plans originally pre
pared by the oflicers and experienced carpenters
of the home, for buildings to cost about $17,
--â¢M10, being replaced by others more ornamental,
Though no more commodious or serviceable,
and designed at an increased expense of fully
$ 10,000 by the architect and superintendent
appointed by friendly directors.
Ninthâ That the directors used some of the
funds appropriated by the State and "Congress
for the maintenance of veterans in lobbying
at the legislative sessions of 1893 and 1895 to
obtain a continuance of the home annual al
lowance of $45,000, and also to defeat the acts
of 1895. calling for bids and contracts for the
home supplies and for the abolishing of the
superfluous office in San Francisco.
Tenthâ That the directors have disposed of
the special State appropriation of $ 50.000 made
in March, 1895, as follows: About $23,000 for
n poorly adapted general dining hall and two
private residences for the commandant and
medical director, respectively ; about $17,000
hocus-pocused Into the home treasury to re
place the stealing of Treasurer Royce and his
partners; and about $10,000 used to liquidate
old debts of the board; whereas, the whole of
this appropriation was intended for perma
nent improvements oh the home grounds for
the use of the old soldiers.
Eleventhâ That George 11. Thomas Tost No. 2,
G. A. EL, has usurped the control of the Veter
ans'Home, having secured all the command
ants but the last, all the treasurers, all the sec
retaries coming from the Grand Army, and
many other officials, while posts that have
labored faithfully for the veterans have practi

cally no voice in the management of the home;
therefore,
Retolved, That his excellency James H.Budd,
Governor of California, be and is hereby re
quested to investigate these matters and cause
suit to be brought against |ne treasurer of the
Veterans' Home Association to recover all
moneys paid h'im by the association for services
rendered the home while a member of said
association; also against the directors for all
moneys appropriated by State or Congress for
the maintenance of members of the Veterans"
Home, which moneys have been used for ex
penses of office in San Francisco or for other
purposes not contemplated in such appropria
tions; and, further, for the misappropriation
of 927,000 out of the (50,000 donated by the
Legislature in March, 1893, to the Veterans'
Home Association, to make permanent im
provement on the home grounds at Yountville
for the use of the soldiers; and, finally, to re
move from office any director who has violated
any by-laws of the Veteran*' Home Association,
or any law of this State or the United States
relating to the association or the management
of the home; or who lias received directly or
otherwise any profit through his ottieial con
nection with said association.
Resolved, That J.yon Tost Xo. 8, G. A. R.,
recommend that the Grand Army at the State
encampment at Puma Cruz in April next, con
sider and act upon the proposition to transfer
the Veterans' Homo property at Yountville to
the State of California, to be kept as a home
for veterans as long as needed and then used
for other State purposes, thereby relieving the
u -and Army from the odium ot the scandals
that seem inseparable irom a directorate man
agement of the home.
Raolvtd, Tlint copies of the?e charges and
resolutions be forwarded to all the (Jrand Army
posts of this department, to the Governor,
Attorney-General, Controller and Treasurer
of this State and to the California members of
Congress.
These resolutions have been adopted by
Lyon Post No. 8, G. A. R., of Oakland,
and copies of them will be forwarded to the
Governor, the Attorney-General, the Con
troller and the State Treasurer and to
every Grand Army post in the Department
of California and Nevada.
Thus, the long-threatened war between
many (J. A. EL posts and the directorate
of the Yountville Home has broken out,
and within a lew days every veteran in the
California and Nevad^a Department will be
involved.
A hint of what was coming was con
tained in The Call story regarding the
autopsies held on the bodies of soldiers
who die in the home, published two weeks
ago. It brought forth some correspond
ence from both sides, and many other
issues were brought up. The opposition
to the management of the home reached a
climax last night when Lyons Post of this
city adopted resolutions denouncing the
home, charging fraud and calling on the
Governor for an investigation.
Before passing the resolutions, Lyons
Post was assured of the hearty co-opera
tion of many posts in the department, and
their action will precipitate one of the
liveliest campaigns ever inaugurated in
the G. A. R. The subject is bound to come
up at the next encampment, which as
sembles at Santa Cruz on April 21.
THAT BLUE ENVELOPE
A Fair Officer Served a Sum
mons on Mrs. Emma
Gregory.
WOMAN OUTWITS WOMAN.
The Weil-Known Lady Suffragist in
the Power of a Defrauded
Landlord.
FemiDine finesse served a novel purpose
at a meeting of the Woman's Republican
State Central Club last evening.
The proceedings had progressed to the
point of extending a vote oi thanks to the
speakers, that is, Mrs. Emma Gregory was
about to move such a vote wlien a pretty
young woman, modishly dressed and
wearing dainty short-bowed glasses, left
her place near the door from which she
had witnessed the proceedings.
"I beg your pardon. Is this Mrs. Greg
ory'."' she asked sweetly.
Mrs. Gregory smilingly answered in the
affirmative.
'â¢I promised to deliver this note," said
the young lady. Mrs. Gregory thanked
the bearer, who smilingly made her exit.
Mrs. Gregory did not break the seal of
the robin's egg-blue envelope until she
bad finished her speech extolling the tal
ents of the speakers of the evening, Judge
Cooney and Edgar Briggs.
When she settled back into her chair
after the five minutes' address, she drew
from the square blue envelope a big legal
document that had been doubled and care
fully placed therein. She had been served
with an order of examination and she will
appear before Justice Groezinger on the
28th inst. or be lined for contempt of court.
Mrs. Emma Gregory is a well-known
advocate of woman suffrage. She is a
member of the constitutional amend
ment campaign committee of Cali
fornia and has always raised her
voice in protest against political ine
quality. She is also one of the faction
that has come to be known as the "dis
senting Portias." Her intelligence and
education have never been questioned,
but of late there has been some expression
of doubt as to her honesty.
Last March Mrs. Emma Gregory, her
husband and her son-in-law and daughter,
Dr. and Mrs. Gregory Flesher, left a flat,
at 819 Lombard street, at the request of
their landlord, Mr. McCluskey, as they
were in arrears to the amount of $120 for
rent.
Dr. Flesher was sued for the amount, but
pleaded his inability to pay it. Mrs.
Gregory was taken to account for the same,
but said she and her husband merely
boarded with them and were not responsi
ble for the debts of Dr. and Mrs. Fiesher.
Judgment was secured for the amount
of the delinquency.
But a rumor that an expected legacy had
been received by the family became rife
and Mr. McCluskey accordingly arranged
for the issuance of an order of examina
tion. It was issued in December, but so
vigilant was the dissenting Portia and her
family that it had not been served up to
last evening. The door was barricaded at
just the proper legal height and the mes
senirers of the law always returned bear
ing the order and a dejected expression.
The pretty yoting lady was equal to the
occasion, however, and last evening she
rose to it with admirable acumen. Mrs. J.
Cooper, who served the summons, is fa
miliar with the duties of an attorney's
clerk. She also knows the habits and idio-
Byncrasies of her sex. When she learned
that Mrs. Gregory would be in attendance
at the club she inclosed the much-worn
summons, addressed to Dr. Flesher and
family in an envelope of the stereotyped
sort used by ladies who "receive" and" car
ried the coup d'etat to its successful issue
of last evening.
Dr. <.rtgory Flesher, who dropped his
own Christian name and assumed his
bride s surname instead upon their mar
riage, is in charge of the pharmacy at
Haight and Pierce streets. \
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2U, 1896.
JAKE RUDOLPH
WITH HIS GUN
He Has Again Started Out
to Annihilate Billy
Harrison.
RENEWS AN OLD FEUD.
Chris Buckley's Nephew Is
Afraid His Life Is in
Danger.
HE ASKS FOR PROTECTION.
The Judges and the Chief of Police
Know of No Way to Stop His
Nemesis.
Jflko Rudolph, who for years was the
guide of Christopher Buckley, the blind
politician, is out gunning once again.
It will be remembered that he took a
shot at the Chronicle's business manager
two years ago, and likewise tried to kill
Austin Fitzgerald, a politician who is
on his blacklist.
A week ago Rudolph cast his glove at
the feet of Billy Harrison, Buckley's
nephew, and challenged him verbally to
a ' ; gun light." There were people enough
around at the time to prevent bloodshed,
and Rudolph, his wrath and his gun
were packed away by Officer Harry Rey
nolds. He was not jailed, however, but
allowed to roam at. his own sweet will, to
the great discomfort of those individuals
who know that lie is in such a frame of
mind that he is iikely at any moment to
begin shooting.
Tuesday night Rudolph went again in
search of Harrison. He found him at the
corner of Market and Ellis streets chatting
with some friends. Harrison had his back
turned at the time, and Rudolph advanced
upon him rapidly with his right hand in
his pocket. He had all the appearance of
a man who was about to draw a weapon.
Harrison was notified by one of his friends
that his enemy v. - as advancing and he
turned suddenly, and the two stood face
to face. They glared at each other, and
Harrison, who had run his own hand into
his pocket, realized the danger he was in,
as he had not brought hia revolver from
his home. AVeapqnless, he felt that his
only chance for life was to stick closely to
Rudolph and attack him should he make
an attempt to draw.
Rudolph, looking straight at Harrison,
spoke as though addressing some one else,
although his allusion was plainly to the
man he was looking for. Harrison bad a
piece of gum in his mouth and Rudolph
asked: "Is there any other
around here who's got" some tutti frutti?"
Harrison was cool enough to refrain
from speaking to Rudolph, and this fact
probably prevented the opening of hos
tilities.
By that time one of Rudolph's followers
succeeded in getting him away.
In speaking of the affair yesterday Har
rison said: "Everybody tells me "to do
nothing, because Jake is crazy. That is
all well enough to talk about. If he's
crazy he should be put back in the asylum,
where he came from. Bat I don't think
he's crazy; I believe he knows just what
he is doing.
"I have been to Chief Crowley and have
told him of Rudolph's attitude toward me,
and have asked for protection, as I do not
want to be murderer!. The Chief does not
see exactly h6w he can help me out,
neither does a Judge of the Superior Court
to whom I have appealed, so I feel it in
cumbent upon myself to see that I am not
abused or molested."
Harrison was advised to have Jake Ru
dolph placed under bonds to keep the
peace.
"Why should I do that?" he asked.
"Sam llainey and pave Xeagle will go on
his bond, as they did on a former occasion,
and he will be liberated in a more aggres
sive condition than ever."
Marion Wilson, the ex-deputy sheriff,
who is as brave a man as there is in the
county, and who is a staunch friend of
Harrison, accompanied the latter in his
promenade yesterday. He spoke as if he
did not propose to allow Jake Rudolph to
run amuck or even bluff around the peo
ple with whom he associated.
Alex Greggains, the past master in physi
cal culture, is likewise a close friend of
Harrison's, and he says he does not iutend
to see his friend have anything less than
an even chance, if the conflict with Ru
dolph assumes only the proportions of a
fist fight.
GREGGAINS AND SHARKEY.
The Fireman Shows the White
Feather by Refusing to Box
the Sailor.
The managers of the National Athletic
Club, who were figuring on having an ex
cellent fistic programme for their next en
tertainment, were given a very unpleasant
surprise last evening when word came
from "Professor" Alexander Greggains,
the protector of Billy Harrison, the politi
cian, that owing to pressure of business, it
would be utterly impossible for him to sign
articles to box Tom Sharkey on the even
ing of March 6.
Gr eggains was up to yesterday "boiling"
for an opportunity to meet Sharkey in a
twenty-four-foot ring, but a change for the
worse ha3 come over the scientific and po
litical body-guard of ex-Manager Harrison,
and as a consequence Tom Sharkey will
have to look to other and better lields to
conquer.
The friends of Greggains do not think
that the ex-fireman is in the least bit
afraid of the famous pugilist of the navy,
but it is quietly rumored that Greggains,
who is a particular friend of Harrison,
will remain "on guard' r until such time as
the relative of "Boss" Buckley is satisfied
that the coast is clear of big Jakey In
dians who are on the warpath for "some
political scalps.
Palacke, the all-round athlete and swim
mer, of Australia, visited the Olympic
Club last night and was given %n oppor
tunity to try his muscle on Van Buskirk,
the heavy-weight champion boxer of the
club.
Sufficient to say that the Olympian boxed
all over the invader and would have cut
him to sleep were it not lor the timely in
terference of Manager Kennedy, who called
a halt in time to save Palacke from a funny
experience on the floor. The Australian
then tried swimming and was very easily
disposed of by Pape and Tavlor. who beat
him in a short spurt. Palack* now wants
to meet any man on the coast in a swim
ing race from Butchertown to the Faral
lone Islands. Manager Kennedy says that
if the champion of Australia will extend
the race to Santa Cruz he will meet him
for marbles or money, and that the latter
talks.
Court of Appeals.
The Court of Appeals yesterday affirmed the
decision of the lower court in the matter of
the Humboldt Lumber Manufacturers' Asso-
ciation against Olivia Christopherson. The
latter sued the association for $25,000 for the
death of her husband, who was drowned by
the capsizing of a tug belonging to the Huru

ASH WEDNESDAY SERVICES.
The Day of Penitence Wag Obserred
by Episcopalians.
Special Ash Wednesday services were
held yesterday in the Episcopalian
churches in this City. Three services were
held at St. John the Evangelist's, the Holy
Innocents', the Church of the Advent, St.
Luke's and St. Stephen's. St. Mary the
Virgin's Church held four services, the
Good Samaritan Mission two and Trinity,
Grace Church and St. Peters each held
the service of morning prayer.
There were no evensong services in the
various churches, as the Episcopalians hold
united services every Wednesday during
Lent.
The first of the present Lenten series
was held last night in Grace Church, at
the corner of California and Stockton
streets. The special preacher was Kev.
M. D. Wilson, who took as his text "The
Marriage of the King's Son."
At the cathedral a solemn mass was cele
brated in the forenoon, the ashes being
blessed by his Grace the Archbishop. At
St. lenatius Church the ceremony of bless
ing the ashes took place at the early hour
of 6:30 in the morning, followed by the
celebration of low masses until 9 o'clock.
The Kquitable L.ife'9 Statement.
Assets over $201,000,000, surplus over
$40,000,000. These, according to the annual
statement of the Equitable Life Assurance
Society, show the financial standing of the
society to-day. The exact amount" of the
surplus is $40,024,011 73, which is the
largest surplus of any life assurance com
pany in the worid. The wisdom of the
society, or rather of the officers who direct
it, in building up this colossal surplus is
shown In the fact of the constantly de
creasing rate of interest on high class
securities such as a life assurance company
would, or at all events should, invest in.
One of the strictest liabilities of an old
line company is the "legal reserve," which
is held by the company according to law,
to guarantee the payment of all its policies.
Hitherto this reserve has been based on
the assumption that a company can make
4 per cent per annum on its investments.
There is no doubt, however, in the opinion
of good authorities that this reserve will
have soon to be placed on a 3j^ per cent
or even a 3 per cent basis. The wisdom of
the Equitable's course is here shown by
the fact that even on the most rigid 3 per
cent basis the society would still have a
surplus of many millions of dollars over
all liabilities.
THREE OLD SUITS.
They Bested Quietly for Twenty Years
Before Being Dismissed.
Three old cases, so old that the ink in
the complaints and answers has faded to a
dull yellow, were dismissed by order of
Judge Slack yesterday.
The three old suits involved the title to
the lot on the southwest corner of Jackson
and Mason streets and the two lots adjoin
ing on Mason. One was broueht by Asa
White against John A. : Zoller, on April 16,
1868. R. P. and Jabish Clement were the
complainant's attorneys. Another was
brought by William Moore against William
D. Leavenworth, Frank Knowles and
others, through James McCabe, attorney
in June, 1857, and the third was brought
by John West against A. Meyer, in April,
1868, through S. T. and L. Reynolds, at
torneys.
The suits were dismissed' on motion of
the defendants or their representatives in
each case, the grounds being that no action
had been taken in them for twenty years.
Judge Slack accordingly ; dismissed them
all." â  ; . â -.'â â .' :.:-; " 'â '.'â ' - . '

DOUBT JOHNSON'S COURSE
Miners' Association Will Make
Investigation as to His
Attitude.
The Sacramento Chamber of Commerce
Promise Heartily to Support
the Bill.
The executive committee of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association met last even
ing In the Union League Club rooms for
the purpose of considering the advisa
bility of lending the support of their body
to the Johnson mineral lands bill now
pending in Congress.
Chairman J. H. Neff. opening the meet
ing, stated that the committee had re
ceived advices from Washington to the
effect that a bill, formulated in connection
with Mr. Herrin of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company and wi th Mr. Ralston
and Mr. Ford, has been passed by Con
gress.
.Before, however, th e matter of the John
son bill was discussed resolutions were
read by Secretary Sonntag, recently passed
by the Sa cramento Chamber of Commerce,
promising hearty support to any bill be
fore Congress which would work bene
ficially to the miners and not interfere
with the interests of the farmers of the
Sacram-ento Valley.
A resolution submitted by Professor
Christy instructing the secretary of the
Miners' Association to acknowledge a. re
ceipt of the resolutions and to assure
the Sacramento Chamber of Commerce
that they would be ready to join in any
movement of development of the water
ways of the Sfate provided the rights of
the miners were reported, was unani
mously adopted. The resolutions asked
of the Chamber of Commerce copies of
the Johnson bill to be sent to the members
to study before further action was taken.
A resolution offered by J. M. Wright
was adopted authorizing the president of
the association to appoint a committee of
live of which the president would form
one to canvass the qualifications of appli
cants for commissionership under the
mineral land3 classification act.
T. J. Parsons stated that there had been
a great deal of discussion as to Grove L.
Johnson's standing toward the miners
he might support the provisions of the
bill and still be aggressively opposed to
hydraulic mining.
Air. Parsons read a clipping from a
Marysville paper stating that Mr. Johnson
was actively and aggressively opposed to
the miners. On the strength of this Mr.
Parsons submitted i resolution, which was
adopted, stating that a thorough investi
gation be made of the attitude of the Hon
Grove L. Johnson toward the interests of
the miners.
It was the opinion of Secretary Sonntaa
that Mr. Johnson was wholly on the side
of the miners and that he would neglect
no effort of advancing their interests in
Congress.
