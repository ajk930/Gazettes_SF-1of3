HAVANA, Cuba, March 16.â The Espana
battalion met 1000 insurgents under La
cret, near El Palme, east of Havana, and
an engagement took place that lasted two
hours.
It is reported that the rebels left seven
dead on the field and carried other dead
and wounded off with them. The troops
bad three wounded.
Insurgents have entered the town of
Guara, province of Havana, and sacked
and burned a number of stores. Their
presence caused a panic.
There were no losses in the rebel attack
on the town of Batabano Saturday.
The insurgents burned the police head
quarters, the town hall, a church, a num
ber of stores, two coffee houses, five resi
dences and fifty-three frame buildings.
They practically reduced the town to
ashes. A gunboat in the harbor shelled
the rebels during the attack.
A rebel band has burned the buildings
en La Brimo estate and a residence on
La Vega estate, near Colon.
Antonio Maceo, the insurgent leader,
with his forces has crossed the province of
Havana and entered the province of Pinar
del Rio. J. Frank Clare.
"SPAZS HAH AO MERCY."
Senator Morgan Makes an Appeal for
the Cuban*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 16.â 1n
tbe Senate to-day El kins (R.) of West Vir
ginia offered a resolution instructing the
Conuaiuee on Foreign Relations to report
to the Senate before avote is taken set
ting fdrth whether or not there exists a
state of war in Cuba; if so, how long it has
existed; the number of men and officers
engaged on each side; whether or not the
insurgents have a constitution and organ
ized government; what cities and towns,
inland and on the seacoast, they occupy;
and what effect the passage of the resolu
tions would have on the insurgents, the
Spanish Government and the United
States.
The resolution went over until to-mor
row.
The conference report on the Cuban
belligerency resolutions was taken up and
Morgan (D.) of Alabama, a member of tbe
Committee on Foreign Relations, ad
dressed the Senate in favor of the adoption
of the report.
Morgan went through and gave a brief
resume from a pile of petitions and me
morials from all parts of the country in
favor of the independence of Cuba. They
came, he said, from almost every county
in the United States and represented a
wide-reaching range of petitioners.
Hale (R.) of Maine remarked that all
Senators were familiar with the methods
of which most of the petitions presented
to Congress were prepared. He did not
know whether it was so in this case, but
he presumed that all these petitions were
under a printed heading, sent out from a
tingle source. The spontaneity of the
petitions came, not from the country, but
from New York and Washington.
Morgan made some deprecatory remarks
about the business, conservative and prop
erty-owning men who -wanted to prevent
any legislation that might cost them a
little money or cause a little disturb
ance of business relations. He went
oh to say that the Committee on
Foreign Relations had not supposed that
it was dealing improperly with that great
mass of petitions. His object was, he
said, to show the amount of pressure that
had been brought to bear on tne Commit
tee on Foreign Relations to show how con
servative and careful that committee had
been.
Hale made an inquiry about the paper
from the Spanish Minister to which Sher
man had "unwarily" referred to the other
day, and he asked why the Committee on
Foreign Relations had not reported the fact
of that paper to the Senate.
Morgan explained that the paper had
been communicated by the Spanish Minis
ter to Mr. Olney, and that Mr. Olney
had concluded it to be his duty to send it
to the Committee on Foreign Relations.
It had not been sent in any form. It was
the original paper that had been sent, and
It was returned to the Secretary of State.
Morgan said that he had written to the
Secretary for a copy of the paper, and had
been informed that Mr. Olnev would con
pult the Minister about it. The Minister
had given his consent, and a copy of the
paper had been sent to him (Morgan), and
ht would now read it, with comments, to
the Senate.
Hale remarked that he would be glad
even at this late date to have it brought be
fore the Senate. Morgan then began to
read the paper from the Spanish Minister
by sentences and to comment upon it as he
went along. When he came to the end of
it he said that that was all of that "miracu
lous and mysterious paper." It was a
men petition for delay and the Senate had
granted that delay. The paper, he said,
was dated the 11th of January, 1896. It
contained a dispatch from General Campos
stating that the so-called Cuban Govern
ment had no fixed residence, and that it
hardly knew where it wandered about.
Morgan commented upon that.
"That is all 'true," he said, "no doubt.
The San Francisco Call.
How many places of habitation did the
Government of the United States and the
Continental Congress have during the
revolutionary war? They had no less than
nine capitals, and the British Government
could not chase them down to cover.
Where was the United States Government
when this Capitol was burned to the
ground? A fugitive in Virginia; and so
the complaint of Campos is only that the
insurgent Government has no fixed resi
dence."
In conclusion Morgan referred to the
"alleged dispatch from the Premier of the
Spanish Government," which Hale read to
the Senate last week. "He read it at
length," said Morgan, "with attentive,
respectful, almost religious presentation,
and after he had got it on the record and
passed his judgment upon it in order to
show the magnanimity of the Spanish
Government and the grounds of its action
in Cuba and to show its relation to the
Government of the United States it now
comes out from the declaration of Mr.
Canovas that he sent no such dispatch and
that he is not responsible for it. The
Senator from Maine was overreached. He
mistook the Spaniard. The Spaniard had
neither mercy nor consideration in his
heart for the poor people of Cubaâ for
those poor mulattoes, negroes and vaga
bonds described by Minister de Lome.
They have no recognition at the court of
Spain. They never had and never will
have."
"Without finishing his speech Morgan
yielded to a motion to adjourn, and at 5:30
the Senate adjourned until to-morrow.
SEEKIXQ THE FILIBUSTERS.
Spanish War Teasel* in Search of Three
.Expeditions.
NEW YORK, X. V., March 16. â A
Journal special from Key West, Fla.,says:
Before the steamships Bermuda, Three
Friends and Commodore, each supposed
to be carrying a filibustering expedition
to Cuba, reach the island they will have to
run the gauntlet of a number of Spanish
warships now cruising off the coast of
Florida- Three days ago the Spanish war
vessel appeared off the South Beach of
the island of Key West. For days the ves
sels hovered around, ten or twelve miles
out, apparently watching for filibusters.
Saturday afternoon the Spanish Vice-
Consul went out to one of the vessels in a
steam launch, and it is supposed gave the
commander some information relative to
the movements of the expected steamers.
Immediately the Vice-Consul left the ves
sels they sailed toward the north. It is
supposed they are now off the east coast
of Florida, watching for the Bermuda,
Three Friends and Commodore.
There is supposed to be a large num
ber of men on one of the Florida keys
who expect to be picked up by one of the
three steamers. The Key is in the United
States waters, however, and it is not be
lieved that the Spanish would dare inter
fere with the men camped there.
It is currently reported here that the
United States authorities will not be as
3trict about seizing suspected vessels
hereafter as they have been. The mere
carrying of arms to Cuba, it is said, will
not .be again interfered with, nor will
revenue cutters seize any vessel on the
high seas. So far as known the United
States officials here have received no
orders to watch out for the suspeued
cruisers. It is generally supposed that
X T ncle Sam has decided to make the
Spaniards do their own patrolling.

authoritatively stated that Captain John

does not represent this Government in any

to Cuba is said to be the result of an error
in granting him permission to go beyond

mined, but it is probable that he will be al
lowed to rent am in Havana with the under
standing that he will not visit other places

STATE COUBTS UPHELD.
Chief Justice Fuller Reads an
Opinion by the Highest
Tribunal of the Land.
MEANING OF THE DECISION.
Railroad* Companies Declared to Be
State and Not Federal
Corporations.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 16. -The
Supremo Court today, in an opinion read
by Chief Justice Fuller, affirmed the deci
sion of the Supreme Court of California to
the effect that the franchises, the capital
stock, etc., of the Central Pacific and
Southern Pacific Railway companies are
taxable under the laws of tnat State.
The opinion declared that the railroad
companies are btate and not Federal cor
porations, although having received fran
chises from the Federal Government. In
this respect the/ stand upon the same
ground as the Union Pacific Company, a
corporation of Kansas.
Justice Field dissented from the judg
ment of the cor rt. Harlan also announced
his dissent from the judgment of thecourt.
The majority opinion was read by Chief
Justice Ful'er, who quoted the constitu
tion of California concerning revenue. The
complar.t contained nineteen counts, he
said, on nineteen alleged causes of action,
each claiming tbat the defendant was not
all times therein mentioned as a California
corporation. The California Equalization
Board for the year ending June 30, 1886,
assessed the State and county taxes at
|0.608 on each $100.
This amounted to $109,440, and none of
it was paid. The State Com ptroller added
$5472 interest. This State tax became de
linquent in December, 1887. There were
eight counts for county taxes, and among
the defenses made by the defendant was
one that they were by act of Congress
made one of the instrumentalities of the
Federal Government, and tnerefore not
subject to State taxation.
A record was read showinsr that the
State Board of Equalization had in March,
1887, assessed the railway at $16,000,000.
It waa admitted that the apportionment
was made as the Political Code required it
to be made and that mileage for each
county was correctly stated. It ap
peared from the testimony of the
Board of Equalization that the Attorney-
General recommended to the board that
the franchises of the Central and Southern
Pacific railways be assessed and that the
valuation be stated separately in the rec
ord of assessments; that the board assess
the moles, bridges and culverts of each
road separately, and the board ordered
that the franchise of the Central Pacific
Railroad derived from California be as
sessed at $1,250,000, the franchise of the
Southern Pacific at $1,000,000. the moles,
tracks and bridges at $1,000,000 and the
wharves at $400,000.
Justice Fuller said : "The real question is
whether the companies' franchises are one
and inseparable, constituting an indivisi
ble unit which cannot be subjected to tax
ation by the State of California, because
that would be necessarily to subject a Fed
eral franchise to taxation. The company
is a corporation of California made, up of
two California corporations consolidated by
articles of association entered into under
the laws of California and recognized as a
California corporation by acts of Congress.
"California authorized the company to
construct, maintain and operate a railroad
and telegraph line in territory lying in the
State with the usual, incidental rights,
privileges and powers: also vesting in the
company rights, franchises and powers
granted by Congress with the exprtss res
ervation that the company should be sub
ject to all the law* â - ilrn 8tÂ»tÂ« concerning
the raiiroad a/; a telegraph lines, except
tnat messapes and property of the United
State? and this State and of the said com
pany shall have priority of transportation
and transmission over said lines of rail
road and telegraph.
"But it is not contended that the com
pany ever became a corporation of the
United States or that it is other Than a
State corporation. Even in respect to rail
way corporations created by act of Con
gress the claim of an exemption of prop
erty from State taxation has been repeat
edly denied.
"Whether plaintiff in error now operates
its road under franchise derived from the
United States or from the State of Califor
nia is immaterial.,
"The right to operate a railroad is valua
ble, whether it be exercised or not, and the
question, we repeat, relates to the exist
ence of a franchise, and not the extent of
its value. When we consider that the
plaintiff in error returned its franchise
after the assessment and declined to resort
to the remedy afforded by the State's laws
for correction of assessment as made, if
dissatisfied therewith, or to pay its
tax and bring suit to recover back a whole
or any part of the tax which it claimed to
be illegal, we think its position is not one
entitled to favorable consideration of the !
court, but without regard to what we hold,
for reasons given the State courts rightly
decided that the company had not a valid
defense to the causes of action proceeded
on. The judement is affirmed."
A similar case brought against the
Southern Papific was affirmed by Justice
Fuller. This was a writ of error to the
judgment of the Supreme Court of Cali
fornia affirming the judgment of the Su
perior Court of the City and County
of Ban Francisco. The Superior
Court denied a new trial in the suit
brought in the name of the people
of California against the Southern

NO VOTES CAST FOR SENATOR.
Plenty of Pistols in Evidence, but the
Day's Session Closes Without
Shooting.
FRANKFORT, Kt., March 16.â With
more than 400 militiamen of Kentucky in
possession of the Capitol square, keeping
from entrance all who had not a constitu
tional right or business relations to be in
the State House, the balloting for United
States Senator proceeded to-day without
disorder and without result.
Only one vote was cast, that of Speed for
Boyle. Democrats and Republicans re
fused to vote and the understanding is
there will be another ballot before final ad
journment to-morrow.
But the day of martial law was full of
sensational incidents in the city and in the
Senate chamber. There was a wrathful
denunciation of the Republican Governor
by the Democratic Senate for ordering the
militia to the Capitol. Senators Bronston
and Fulton introduced resolutions accus
ing the Governor of flaerant usurpation of
power and the Senate adopted that of Mr.
Fulton, appointing him and five others a
committee to investigate â¢ "such contempt
and breach of privilege" and report for
final action.
In the House resolutions indorsing and
condemning the Governor's act were pre
sented and withdrawn. Sergeant- at-Arms
Sommers of the Senate was allowed to pass
the line of fixed bayonets, but Colonel Jack
Chirm and his other deputies were turned
back.
An indignation meeting of citizens was
held in the Courthouse, which was jammed
with men and women, who cheered the
Mayor and other speakers.
At 10 o'clock this morning every entrance
to the State buildings was patrolled by a
militiaman with a bayoneted gun. The
Governor was in his office nearly all night
and was around early this morning. The
streets were jammed as early as 8 o'clock,
and every incoming train wss loaded down
with Blackburn sympathizers and curious
people who came to see a row. Every
man's pocket looked heavy and pistols
were very much in evidence when a man
took a seat. Rev. Mr. Cooper, the chap
lain of the penitentiary, whose turn it was
this morning to opm the House with
prayer, was stopped at the entrance by a
sentry. He finally got through, but "re
fused to dishonor God while Kentucky was
being dishonored. The House can go
without prayer as far us I am concerned."
The McCreary Gaards of Frankfort were
placed at the stairway leading to the
Legislature's balls and no one was allowed
to go up but State officials, members of
the Legislature, newspaper men and
telegraph operators. Colonel J. B. Castle
man of Louisville was made active com
mander of the troops. Most of the mem
bers of the Legislature arrived early at the
State House and they joked about the
situation. There seemed to be a feeling of
relief after the strain of weeks. Among
the first to arrive were Drs. Walton and
James, the unseated Republican Senators.
They took the same seats they occupied in
the House since their expulsion from the
Senate.
Senator Blackburn and ex-Congressman
Phil Thompson arrived at the House stair
way at 30:30 o'clock. The Senator was
allowed to co up, but Mr. Thompson was
turned back. A minute later Sergeant-at-
Arras Sommers of the Senate, accom
panied by Colonel Jack Chirm, Eph
Lillard and his other newly sworn in
deputies was halted. Mr. Sommers
showed his papers and those of his depu
ties. He was told to go himself, but his
deputies were ordered to remain behind.
Both houses met at 11 o'clock. The first
scene was in the House. Bailey (R.)
sent up resolutions indorsing tie Gov
ernor's action, and Force (D.) a sub
stitute condemning the executive. After
great disorder it was agreed to withdraw
both resolutions.
The first thing in the Senate was a reso
lution by Senator Bronston reciting that
the Governor had, in violation of the con
stitution, taken possession of the Capitol
with troops, and declaring that the Senate
refuses, so long as the State militia re
mains in control of the Capitol, to con
sider any matter of legislation or to receive
or consider any communication from the
Governor.
Bronston demanded their adoption in
a bitter speech, calling on every man who
was not willing to crawl on his belly to
vote for them. The chair ruled that
Bronston's resolutions were out of order,
and an appeal was taken. A few women
managed to get by the soldiers and took
seats in the lobby. The chair and other
speakers Killed all the time up to 12
o'clock, speaking. The rollcali began and
the Democrats refused to answer to their
names. Even Poor did not vote. Only
sixty-six answered to their namesâ all Re
publicans.
The chair ruled that a vote would be
necessary to show that seventy were "pres
ent and voting" and ordered the ballot.
Both Democrats and Republicans refused
to vote. The only indication of any mem
bers being present was the general laugh
that went round. Each side thought the
other was afraid. Speed of Louisville voted
for Boyle and that was the only vote cast.
When the motion to adjourn was made,
Bronston wanted to know the ruling of
the chair as to whether a ballot should be
taken to-morrow. The adjournment was
with the understanding that the ballot
would be taken at 12 it both houses were
in session at the hour. There was no sign
of disorder.
The Senate took up the Bronston reso
lution and others when it returned from
the joint session. Senator Fulton (D.) in
troduced one, which was adopted, declar
ing all of Governor Bradley's acts illegal,
closing as follows:
"Be it resolved by the Senate, that a spe
cial committee be appointed to inquire
into such contempt and breach of privi
lege in the manner and under authority of
law and to report to the House at the
earliest practicable moment."
There was not standing room in the
Courthouse when the indignation meeting
to protest against the action of Governor
Bradley in calling out the troops was called
to order by Mayor Julian. His Honor
made a speech, telling of his conference
with Governor Bradley, in which he had
assured the executive that he would give
the Legislature ample protection, and
characterized his action in ordering out
the troops as highly partisan and unbe
coming a Governor.
Resolutions were adopted denouncing
the Governor's action as a usurpation of
the law and a prostitution of his office for
partisan purposes, and stating that the
civil authorities had been adequate to pre
serve the peace. The bitterest feeling ex
isted, and on all sides could be heard out
spoken words characterizing the action as
an insult to the people of Frankfort and of
the commonwealth.
The startling feature of the day was the
result of the investigation committee.
The Democrats expected to establish that
Governor Bradley and the Republican
leaders had conspired to call out the
militia in order to compel the Senate to
allow Senators Walton and James to vote.
The testimony of Colonel Gaither
showed that the Democrats had been in
communication with John and Phil
Thompson and others of their faith for
the purpose of tilling the Capitol with
armed men and intimidating the General
Assembly. Colonel Gaither's* testimony
created a sensation.
In answer to a question from Goebel the
colonel replied that he believed the Sena
tor to have been cognizant of the plans of
Phil Thompson's resort to arras. He said
Phil Thompson told him if he came to the
Capitol he would be killed.
Governor Bradley was also on the stand.
His testimony was substantially to the
same effect as the statement given out by
him last night. Phil Thompson corrob
orated the statements made by Colonel
Gaitber.

ADVANCE UP THE NILE.
An Explanation for the Reason
ot Rushing Forces Into
the Soudan.
DEBATED BY THE LEADERS.
Labouchere Contends That the Expe
dition Against the Dervishes
Is Worse Than Useless.
LONDON, Exg., March riÃ.â George N.
Ourzon, Parliamentary Secretary of the
Foreign Office and the representative of
that department of the British Govern
ment inthe House of Commons, made a
statement in the House to-day which seta
at rest all doubts, if any there were, as to
the attitude of Great Britain toward the
Dreibund, the Government coming out
squarely in favor of and in sympathy with
Italy in the latter's campaign in Abyssinia
and justifying the course adopted by Lord
Salisbury in sending an expedition against
Dongola.
Mr. Curzon said that for some time past
the Government had heard rumors that a
large and formicable advance of the der
vish forces was contemplated, which
threatened three widely separated points â
Murch Wells, between Korosko and Abu-
Hamed, next to Kar, between Berber and
Suakin, and also Kassala. Then came the
disaster to the Italian army at Adowa,
which had been heard throughout the
United Kingdom with much sympathy
and regret. [Cries from the Irish benches
of "No, no," and a remark by T. H. Healy,
"It served them right.")
Mr. Curzon, resuming his remarks after
the interruption, said: "Yes; sympathy
which was not broken, by but a few dis
senting voices." [Cheers.]
The Government has been in constant
communication with the Government of
Egypt, and the opinion of the military of
ficials, both here and in Cairo, is that an
advance up the Nile is necessary. Conse
quently an advance of British troops has
been ordered to a town one-third of the
distence between Wady Haifa and Don
gola.'
Mr. Curzon further said that after the
Soudan expedition had reached Akasheh,
between Wady Haifa and DongaJa, it
possibly would advance to Doneola,
Mr. Labouchere moved to adjourn in
order to consider the serious condition
which had been revealed by the statement
in regard to Egypt and the Soudan made
by Mr. Curzon. Mr. Labouchere cou
tended that the expedition into the Sou
dan was worse than needless.
The motion was rejected.
Sir Charles Dilke said that he did not
believe that the real object of the expedi
tion was the safety of Egypt, nor a diver
sion in favor of the Italians, which was
impossible.
Sir William Vernon Harcourt, the Lib
eral leader in the House, followed Sir
Charles Dilke. He said that if this was
the first step of a forward policy in Egypt
it was of a roost perilous character and de
served strenuous opposition.
There was a great party in England, he
said, which learned nothing from experi
ence and which was always eager for the
extension of the empire, which was al
ready large enough to please the most in
ordinate ambition. He would not in the
meantime assume that there was any in
tention on the part of the Government to
give the movement up the Nile a signifi
cance beyond Mr. Curzon's statement.
He aslted the House to note that the
Government repudiated any intention to
pccupy the Soudan. The House was
bound to assume that this was a small
movement for military purposes to meet a
temporary occasion. He hoped there
would be an early opportunity to discuss
the matter in the larger bearings when
the whole policy of the occupation of
Egypt was considered. [Cries of "Hear!
hear!"]
The Higlit Hon. A. J. Balfour, Govern
ment leader in the House, said that all the
Government could state at present was
that the advance must be made. It would
be premature to discuss the further move
ments intended. Mr. Labouchere, he
added, seemed to rejoice at the defeat of
Italy.
Mr. Labouchereâ Hear! hear!
That, Mr. Balfour continued, was cer
tainly not the view of a single man on the
Government side of the House; nor was it
the view of a majority of the opposite
side [Cries of "Hear! hear!"] nor of the
English people. [Cheers.] Even the na
tions of Europe whose policy is most di
vergent from that ot Italy expressed sym
pathy for the Italians in their reverses.
Mr. Labouchere also rejoiced because of
the resurgence of Mahdiism. Had the
world ever seen a more cruel orwors3 rule?
He could not conceive a change more for
the benefit of the Soudan than that that
country should be transferred to a Govern
ment acting under English influence.
Nothing certainly would more conduce to
the welfare and prosperity of the Soudan
ese than replacing brutal anarchy by regu
lar laws.
The Government had no reason to be
lieve that any great power would object to
the expedition. Certainly those powers
favorable to Italy would not object, and
any other power that was desirous that
Egypt should remain prosperous and se
cure would not regret the step the Govern
ment had taken.
The Government did not dream of ex
tending the conquest to Darfur. That was
a nightmareâ a creation of Sir Charles
Dilke's imagination. The rumor of a
British advance would spread with light
ninglike rapidity to the Mad hist regions.
There could be no better diversion in favor
of the Italians, even if the expedition went2
no further than Akasheh, or one-third of
the way to Dongola.
John Redmond, member for Waterford
City and one of the Parnelite leaders, said
that if the expedition met with a misfor
tune similar to that which had befallen
the Italians, the news would be received
with satisfaction by the greater number of
the Irish members of the House.
Robert A. Yerburgh, Conservative mem
ber for Chester, asked if in view of
the increasing dependence of the United
Kingdom upon foreign wheat, the Govern
ment would take measures to secure the
acceptance of the principle of International
law, contention for which was originally
advanced by the United States, that pro
visions shall only be treated as contraband
of war when they are destined to a place
which is invested or blockaded.
Mr. Balfour said he would not venture
to express an opinion in regard to the ex

Akasheh, the town referred to by Mr.
Curson and Mr. Baifour, is the point south
of Wady Haifa which it is the present in
tention of the Government to make the
terminus of a railway from Wady Haifa.
Part of a line is still in existence, but it
has not been used since the evacuation of
Dongela in 1885. Engineers report that
the rapid completion of the line could be
easily effected.
All the Egyptian troops at Cairo will go
to the frontier. Beyond the details of the
preparations and the means of transit that
vill be employed there is no news of mo
ment concerning the expedition. There is
an almost complete absence of enthusiasm
on the subject in the London press. The
Times, which of all the papers most
strongly favors the venture, advocates
Egypt being allowed to eventually recon
quer tne Soudan. Elsewhere the feeling is
expressed that the brief statement made in
the House of Commons by Mr. Curzbn does
not supply sufficient data to enable a
definite judgment to be made.
HOSOREI* BY THE CZAR.
Russia's Ruler Clearly Shows His Sytn-
pathy for Menelek.
VIENNA, Austria. March 16.â A dis
patch to the Neve Freie Press
from St. Petersburg says that the
Czar has conferred upou King Mene
lek of Abyssinia the grand cordon
of St. George, the highest mili
tary decoration in the gift of the Russian
Emperor, and that Baron de Leyondorff,
councilor of the Russian embassy at
Rome, has been intrusted to transmit the
decoration to Abyssinia.
It is expected, the St. Petersburg dis
patch says, 'that King Menelek will ask
Russia to incervene between Abyssinia and
Italy for the conclusion of peace on the
basis of the independence of Abyssinia
and the restoration of the old frontiers of
Erythrea.
ROME, Italt, March 16.â A dispatch

ments which are expected to reach Kassala
to-day.
STRIKERS ARE CONFIDENT
Imported Clothing-Cutters In
duced to Quit Work
and Depart.
Leaders Declare That if New York
Manufacturers Interfere There
Will Be a Tie-Up There.
CHICAGO, 111., March 16. â Fourteen
clothing-cutters who were induced to come
here from New York to take the places of
the strikers were yesterday prevailed upon
to return, and the strikers were jubilant
to-day over their success because others
would be discouraged from coming. The
strike leaders among the cutters said they
will be able to hold out until July 1, and in
the meantime the manufacturers would
lose their trade, and the victory of the
latter would be a barren one. It is claimed
that $7000 came into the strikers' treasury
yesterday from sympathetic trade unions.
Officials of the Cutters' Union declare that
if they discover New York manufacturers
are in any way aiding those here by mak
ing clothing or sending non-union cutter?,
there will be another general tie-up of the
clothing business in New York by order of
the Garment-workers' Union.
SWINDLED BUSINESS FIRMS.
Clever Scheme of a Real Estate Broker and
a Saloon- Keeper by Which They
Secured a Big Sum.
CHICAGO, 111., March 16. â Patrick
Larkins, a saloon-keeper, and F. P. Vin
cent, a real estate broker, are under arrest
here, charged with swindling a number of
Chicaeo business firms out of an aggregate
of $40,000. It is alleged that for the past
three months Larkins, Vincent and an
other man, not yet under arrest, have
been going around the city buying any
thing and everything they .could get on
credit. In all cases notes were offered in
payment indorsed by a man named Rein
hardt. The notes were accepted in numer
ous cases, as the indorser is rated as own
ing some property. It is alleged, however,
that the notes indorsed by Reinhardt
amount to many times the value of the
property he owned, and that now he has
disposed of his holdings and left the city.
Larkins and Vincent own practically noth
ing and are not good for the debts con
tracted.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 16.-Rep
resentative Patterson of Tennessee made
public to-day the following, which he re
ceived this morning from Secretary Car
lisle :
Treasury Department, >
Office of the Secretary, >
Washington, D. C, March 16, 1896.)
Hon. Jo&iah Patterson, House of Representa
tivesâMy Dear Sir: Your favor of February
17 was duly received, and ought to have
been answered at once, but the pressure of
official business has compelled me to delay a
response until now.
You state that in a speech delivered by Hon.
Charles F. Crisp in the House of Representa
tives on the 14th day of February that gentle
man said: "He (meaning the Secretary of the
Treasury) refused to give silver for gold be
cause he must hold the silver to pay the silver
certificates aud Sherman notes, issued under
the act of 1890, and, when a Sherman note is
sued under the act of 1890 is presented, he re
deems it in gold and not in silver. What
mockery Is this? What sort of friendly treat
ment is accorded silver by this law and the
practice that obtains at the Treasury of the
United States?" and you ask me to state fully
how you (i) have dealt with the silver cur
rency since your (my) incumbency of the office
of Secretary of the Treasury, and whether you
(I) have in dealing; with the subject discredited
silver?
In answer to your question I can only say
that in all the operations of the Treasury De
partment during my administration of its
affairs the legal tender gold and silver coins
of the United States have been treated pre-
cisely alike, except that great efforts have
been made to keep silver coins in circulation
rather than have been made to keep gold coins
in circulation. The amount paid out by the
department in silver coins and silver certifi
cates greatiy exceeds the amount paid out in
gold coins and gold certificates, and in no in
stance lias the least discrimination been made
against silver or its paper representative. In
no instance has silver or silver certificates
been refused in payment of a debt or demand
on the Government, and in no instance has
the Government refused to pay silver coins or
silver certificates in the discharge of its obli
gations when the holders of the obligations
demanded or rÂ«quested such payment.
When United States notes or treasury notes
are presented for redemption, gold is paid if it
is demanded, and if silver is demanded the
silver is paid. Thus the coins of the two
metals are treated exactly alike in making
payments by the Government as well as in the
discharge of.de bts due to the Government. It
has always been the policy of the Treasury De
partment to encourage the use of silver to the
largest possible extent, and in order to accom
plish this standard silver dollars will be sent
by express at tue expense of the Government
to any one who -will deposit an equivalent
amount of sliver certificates or treasury notes
of 1890 with the United States Treasurer or
with a National bank depository, and subsi
diary silver coins will be sent by express at the
expense of the Government to any one who
will deposit with such officers or banks any
kind of United States currency or National
banknotes! but gold is not sent to anybody
free of etiarge.
In August, 1893, there was a great and un
usual demand iv nearly every part of thecoun-
try for currency of Email denominations, and
in ita attempts to supply the demand the
Treasury Department paid out in defraying
the expenses of the- Government and in ex
change for other forms of currency all the silÂ»
ver that could be lawfully used for these pur
poses, so that for a short period it was com
pelled to suspend payment in standard silver
dollars, except in the redemption of silver cer
tificates and treasury notes of 1890. The law
authorizing the issue of silver certificates upon
deposits of silver provides that "the coin de
posited for or representing the certificates
shall be retained in the treasury for the pay.
rcent of the same on demand."
It is therefore plain that whenever the
amount of silver dollars in the treasury does
not exceed the amount of silver certificates
outstanding the Secretary of the Treasury can
not, without a violation of law, pay out such
silver, except for the redemption of certifi
cates. At such times he has no more right to
exchange silver dollars for gold than he has to
pay them out in any other manner.
But there is also another fund in the treas
ury which is required by law to be held for a
different purpose. It consists of the bullion
and the standard silver dollars coined from the
bullion Durchased under the act of 1873. The
act provides for the purchase of silver bullion
at the market price and the issuance of treas
ury notes in payment for it, and it also de
clares that no greater or less amount of such
notes shall be outstanding at any one time
than the cost of the silver dollars coined there
for. Under this provision the Secretary is re
quired to keep in the treasury at all times an
amount of silver bullion at its cost price and
in standard silver dollars coined from the pur
chased bullion, exactly equal to the amount of
the treasury notes outstanding, and he can
not, therefore, use such standard silver dollars
except for tbe redemption and cancellation of
treasury notes.
My letter to the United States Senate, upon
which Mr. Crisp's statement seems to have been
based, was written on the 17th day of August,
1893, and at that time there was no free silver
in the treasury; that is, there were no silver
dollars in the treasury, except as the law re
quired to be held for the redemption of silver
certificates and notes. During the month of
August, 1893, treasury notes to the amount of
$1,173,267 were redeemed in silver and can
celed, and since the first day of August, 1593,
the total amount of such notes redeemed in
silver and canceled is $19,533,722.
Prior to my administration of the affairs of
the department none of these notes had been
redeemed in silver or canceled. Since the be-
ginning of this administration nearly $110,
--000,000 of gold has been procured in exchange
for other forms of currency. Of this amount,
$8,915,812 has been secured in exchange for
silver coin and $10,329,330 in exchange for
silver certificates. The department has never
refused to exchange silver for gold when it hes
silver that could be lawfully used for that pur
pose, and If it had so refused, I am wholly un
able to gee how it could be considered a dis
crimination against silver. Is a refusal to pay
out gold in exchange for sliver a discrimina
tion against gold? If not, It of course follows
that a refusal to pay out silver for gold is not a
discrimination against silver.
In response to your verbal inquiry concern
ing the coinage of standard silver dollars dur
ing the present administration, you are ad
vised that it amounts to the sum of .1*6,662.000
up to the 15th day of this month,' while the
whole amount of such dollars coined in this
country from the establishment of the Mint in
1793 up to February, 1878, a period oi eighty

UJ&GJEO AS yA.CAM>IDATE,
Mary Lmae May Mnter the Race for
Attorney- General of Kansa*.
"WICHITA, Kans., March 16.â Mrs.
Mary E. Lease is being strongly urged as a
candidate for the Populist nomination for
Attorney -General of Kansas. When shown
the dispatch to-night stating that the
Agitator, a Populist paper of Garnett,
Kans., had declared for her, she said:
"The suggestion of my candidacy origi
nated, uo doubt, with my friends and
friends of reform who do not believe that
the so-called Populists who traded the
principles of the Populist party for the
services of a corporation attorney wno
holds office by the grace of the Republican
party should be the only aspirants for the
confidence of the people. Wendell
Phillips says the advocates of reform
must be independent of the office or
the demands of bread and butter. This
has been reversed by the reformers of to
day who have sold their party for the
loaves and fishes. I would not trade my
fearless independence for any office in the
gift of the people, but as a resident of this
State and a taxpayer I shall contribute my
little mite toward keeping the people in
formed as to the true inwardness of those
who aspire to office. I believe it is neces
sary to assure my friends in this State that
I shall always be with the people against
party-fixers and boodler reformers."
The friends of Mrs. Lease here are
anxious that she shall make tne race. She
is a member of the local bar and enjoyed a
good practice before she entered the lec
ture field.
WARNED BY THE LEAGUE.
Republican Cluba Cautioned Against
CHICAGO, 111., March 16. -A circular
letter signed by President McAlpin and
Secretary Dowling of the National Repub
lican League was sent to-day to league
officers throughout the country, drawing
their attention to that article of the league
constitution which forbids it in any way
influencing the action of any party con
vention or indicating ita preference for
any candidate before a convention. It is
stated that the circular ia sent "owing to
several complaints* based on information
said to be re.iable, that have been made to
officers of the National League."
The circular adds that any club or
organization affiliating with the National
League is prohibited from indorsing any
candidate for office.
SHOT BY THE ABDUCTORS.
Pursuit of Half- Breeds Who
Were Stealing an In-
dian's Wife.
Now There Is a Prospect of a Revival
of the Feud Between Sioux
and Shoshones.
OMAHA, Nebr., March 16.â The facts
in the case of the shooting of an Indian
neir Fort Washakie bave been received at
army headquarters from the commandant
at that post. He says that Jim Washakie,
grandson of Chief Washakie, was shot
three times by Will Laraeraux, accom
panied by Clem O'Neal, both, half-breeds.
They were abducting Washakie's wife
when he with a half-breed named Dodge
met them. They were fired upon, Wash
akie being wounded in the leg, side and
back, probably fatally.
Lamaraux and O'Neal continued on with
the woman, bound for the British posses
sions, followed by a detachment of Indian
police, who hope to apprehend the fugi
tives at Crow Agency, Mont., where it is
believed they will stop to rest. Should
young Washakie die the Indians will
avenge him by making war on a number
of Sioux half-breeds who are on the reserv
ation.
The Sioux and the Shosbones had many
battles from 1867 to 1873. Tradition says
that the Shoshones consider themselves to
have been badly treated by the Sioux war
riors and they have never' had an oppor
tunity to get their revenge. Captain
Wilson, acting Indian agent, fears that
the old feud beiween the two tribes will be
renewed should young Washakie die.
DARING RAID BY BURGLARS.
Over Seven Thousand Dollars' Worth of Fun
Taken Fn..n a New York
Establishment
NEW YORK, N. V., March 16.-One of
the most daring burglaries which have ever
taken place in this city was reported late
last night to the police of the West One
Hundred and Twenty-fifth street station.
Charles Johnessen, a furrier, occupies the
third and fourth floors of a building on
One Hundred and Twenty-fourth street,
and in addition to bis own stock has kept
a valuable collection of furs in store owned
by private individuals. The entire con
tents of the store were estimated at $10,000.
About 10:15 last night a carriage stopped
at the entrance to the building and three
men alighted. One remained beside the
carriage door, while the others ascended
the stairs. A few minutes later the two
men returned and placing three bundles
in the carriage jumped in, drove away and
disappeared.
On the top floor of the house lives Charles
A. Strasburg, who, with his wife, returned
home late in the evening. MrÂ«. Strasburg,
while passing Johnessen's warerooms,
tripped and fell against the door, which
gave way. It was then ascertained that
the door had been pried open with a jimmy,
which was found near by. Johnessen was
at once notified and found that the rooms
had been thoroughly ransacked and more
than $7000 worth of furs had been taken
away. At the time of the robbery the
front of the building was briebtly illumi
nated by electric lights and the streets
were filled with pedestrians.
SPEED Or THE OLYMPIA.
Remarkable Record Made by the Cruiser
in a Storm.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 16.â A re
cent speed run of the cruiser Olympia be
tween two Chinese ports was made the
subject of an officipl report which has just
reached the Navy Department.
Notwithstanding very rough weather the
Olympia averaged twenty knots an hour,
and would have made twenty-three knots
according to her officers, in smoother
water, thus becoming the fastest cruiser in
the world.
The Minneapolis of our navy, which
holds the record, made her remarkable
speed of twenty-three knots and a fraction
in har official trial, where every condition
was favorable to speed and where forced
draught was used.
The Olympia ran under natural draught.
Her headway was so great that the deck
was swept by the waves and it was neces
sary to slow down to avoid damage oc
curring. The Olympia was built under
private contract at the Union Iron Works,
San Francibco.
FORECLOSURE ON
PACIFIC ROADS.
Representative Hubbard of
Missouri Has Prepared
a Plan.
BONDS MUST BE PAID.
Failing in This the Lines Are to
Be Sold by the Treasury
Department.
TERMS TO THE PURCHASERS.
All Public Lands Not Patented to Be
Restored to the General
Domain.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 16.-Rep
resentative Hubbard of Missouri, a mem
ber of the Committee on Pacific Raiiroads,
has prepared a bill looking to the settle
ment of the indebtedness of the Pacific
roads. The measure directs the Secretary
of the Treasury to ascertain the actual
amount due the Government by the roads
up to and including July 1, 1896.
When this has been ascertained, he is to
demand of all roads to whicn subsidy
bonds haVe been issued that the bonds be
paid on July 1 next. In case they do not
pay on the day named, he is to take all
their property, real and personal, for the
benefit of the Government. On that day,
at 1 o'clock, he is to offer the property for
sale at the Treasury Department. In case
no one bids the amount of the Govern
ment debt the Attorney-General is to bid
it in for the Government.
In case a purchaser is found, one-third
of the purchase money is to be paid
within thirty days, and the balance in ten
years, an equal amount each year.
In case the property is sold the Presi
dent is to appoint three Government
trustees, after which the employes of the
road are to form an association and elect
three trustees to represent them. These
trustees are to manage the roads. A por
tion of the earnings are to be set aside for
the benefit of the employes and the net
profits are to go toward the liquidation of
the debts of the corporations. All public
lands not patented or subject to patent
granted the roads are to be restored to the
public domain.
TOM BVIL.DIMi A Mi ASCII.
Peculiar Proposition Argued Before the
Mouse Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 16.â The
House Committee on Pacific Railroads to
day heard Kepresentatives Meiklejohn of
Nevada, Perkins of lowa and Fletcher of
Minnesota in support of the proposition
looking to the construction of a road from
Sioux City to North Platte to connect with
the Pacific roads.
Meiklejohn said that the orginal plans
providing for building the Pacific rail
road contemplated the construction of
this branch. The branch, however, had
never been built, the claim being made,
but for which there was no foundation,
that the condition of the country would
not allow it. His proposition was that in
settling the affairs of the roads to allow
14,000,000 of the trust fund, accrued under
the Tburman act, to be invested in bonds
to aid in the construction of this road.
He was asked if the Pacific roads would
not object to this. He replied that the
Government had the right to invest this
fund in railroad bonds. The construction
of this connection, he said, was one of
great importance to this section of the
country.
In reply to a question by Powers of Ver
mont he said in case of foreclosure the
plan could hardly be carried out, but if
there was an extension or reorganization
he wanted the committee to carefully con
sider the interests he had presented.
Johnson of California thought the propo
sition could be made the part of any
organization scheme. Perkins indorsed
what MeiKlejohn had said. In settling
matters pertaining to the Pacific railroads
he wanted Congress to improve its oppor
tunity and to right the great wrone which
had been, done to the section referred to.
Fletcher asked the committee to care
fully consider the claims presented in
forming a plan for settlement. He did
not think any member of Congress would
live to see the day that the Government
would go into the railroad business. The
committee adjourned until tA-morrow.

The President this afternoon issued a

Washington, d. c, March 16.â a
telegram to the Navy Department from
Beaufort, S. C, reports that there was not
enough water at Port Royal this morning
to allow the battleship Indiana to pass

NEARING A SETTLEMENT.
Olney's Latest Suggestion to
Salisbury on the Venezue
lan Dispute.
It Is Believed That Sir Julian Paunce
fote Has Been Instructed to
Negotiate.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 16.â While
State Department officials decline to di
vulge the nature of Secretary Olney's lat
est suggestion to Lord Salisbury in regard
to a method of settling the Venezuela dis
pute it is understood that a way has been
opened for negotiations which are expected
to result in some plan of adjusting the
boundary claims satisfactory to all con
cerned. The reply of GreÂ»t Britain to Mr.
Olney's note has not yet actually reached
the State Department, but it is on the way,
and there are good reasons lor believing
that Sir Julian Paunceforte. the British
Embassador, has within the past twenty
four hours received full instructions to cu
ter into negotiations here on the subject.
The arrival in Washington just at this
juncture of Sir Henry Stafford Northcote,
member of Parliament for Exeter and a
diplomat and treaty negotiator of wide ex
perience, has been associated with the Ven
ezuelan affayr* Sir Stafford Northcote,
however, asserts that his visit is purely
personal. He took luncheon with Sir
Julian Paunceforte to-day.
Sir Stafford Northcote accompanied the
Marquis of Ripon to Wasnington to ar
range the Alabama claims treaty of 1871,
serving as secretary of the British Claims
Commission, and he was Lord Salisbury's
private secretary at Constantinople in 1876,
during the important negotiations then in
progress. He has always been considered
an extremely valuable man in just such
negotiations as are now about to take place
in Washington.
Diplomatic relations between Venezuela
and Great Britain have been suspended for
some years, and Minister Andrade and Sir
Julian Pauncefote, the representatives of
those respective nations in Washingt on
have heretofore held no official communi
cation. On Wednesday next a formal state
dinner to Secretary Olney will be given by
the British Embassador. The Venezuelan
Minister has accepted an invitation to the
reception which is to follow. It is possible
this occasion may be made the means of
bringing about a resumption of diplomatic
as well as social amenities between the
diplomats concerned.
LONDON, Eng., March 16. â In the
House of Commons to-day Sir Albert Kaye
Rollit, Independent Conservative, mem
ber for the south division of Islington,
astced what truth there was in the reports
that the United States Government had
expressed willingness that the Venezuelan
dispute be referred to a joint commission
for consideration and settlement.
Hon. George Curzon, Parliamenlary Sec
retary to the Foreign Office, replied that
the Government had received official pro
posals from the United States Govern
ment upon the subject of the Venezuelan
difficulty and that these proposals were
now in course of negotiation and, there
fore, he could not communicate them to
the House.
Mr. Curson, however, stated that the
pioposals made by the United States were
not accurately described by the language

Senator Cannon Attacks the

Smith.
HAS IGNORED THE LAW.
Lodge Argues in Favor of the
Further Restriction of
Immigration.
PUGH TALKS ABOUT FINANCES.
The Restoration of Silver to the Same
Rights of Gold Coinage Is
Advocated.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 16.â
Cannon (R.) of Utah called up in the
Senate to-day a bill in reference to the
TJintah and Uncompahgre Indian reserva
tions in Utah and attacked the policy of
the Secretary of the Interior in relation to
those landsâ declaring that the Secretary
had no right to set up his individual
opinion against the plain provisions of the
"law. He protested in the name of the
people of the West against the course of
the Secretary. The bill went over for the
present.
Palmer (D.) of Illinois offered a resolu
tion, which went over for a future day, de
claring that the unlimited coinage of sil
ver by the United States with forced legal
tender quality would subvert the existing
legal and commercial established values.
Lodge (R.) of Massachusetts then took
the rloor and addressed the Senate on the
immigration bill. He made a strong ar
gument in favor of the further restriction
of immigration so far as illiterate and ig
norant immigrants are concerned.
At the close of Lodge's remarks the
measure was returned to the calendar, and
the House tariff bill, with the Finance
Committee's free coinage amendment, was
taken up.
Pugh (D.) of Alabama addressed the
Senate on the financial question. He
argued as a remedy for the present finan
cial situation the restoration of silver to
the same rights of coinage that gold has
by the re-enactment of the coinage act of
1837, which President Jackson approved,
and the re-establishment thereby of the
only true bimetallic system.

SEVENTH ROUND
"Bright Eyes" No Match
for the Rushing Joe
Walcott.
WAS BADLY PUNISHED
There Was a Material Shorten
ing of the Proposed Length
of the Battle.
FREQUENTLY SENT TO EARTH.
Scott Collins Was Clearly Out of His
Class When He Tackled the
Favorite.
LONG ISLAND CITY, L. 1., March 16.â
The Eureka Athletic Club, formerly well
known as the Puritan Athletic Club, was
opened to-night with a 20-round bout be
tween Joe Walcott, the colored wonder,
and Scott Collins, better known in pugilis
tic circles as "Bright Eyes," for the pre
mier attraction. The clubhouse has been
entirely renovated. Notwithstanding the
bad weather there was a fair crowd pres
ent. Among the well-known lights in the
fistic world who were present at the open
ing was Dan Stuart.
The Walcott-Bright Eyes battle was to
have been decided at Stuart's memorable
El Paso carnival. After an argument be
tween Tommy West of California and
William Quinn of Hatfielt', Pa., in which
the latter was given the decision, the stars
of the evening were announced. Walcott
was a favorite at 100 to 40 on. The bout
was announced as a twenty-round en
counter, which was five rounds shorter
than was advertised for. Time was called
at 10:40 p.m.
Round Iâ After a lot of sparring Walcott
landed a right hand swing on the body.
"Bright Eyes" uppercut Joe with the left, and
â Walcott landed a left swing on the shoulder.
They mixed it up, and Joe swung his left
*wice on the nose, drawing blood. They were
Clinched when the bell rang.
Round 2 â Light sparring. Walcott swung
his right and caught "Bright Eyes" on the
lace. "Bright Eyes" swung and Joe ducked,
the Texan overbalanced and slipped anA Joe
rushed and sent In his left hard on the jaw,
forcing "Bright Eyes" head down. ,-AValcott
fell short and "Bright Eyes" landed a corking
right ou the neck. Joe landed twice lightly on
the chest and followed his man with a "water
melon grin," when the bell rang.
Round 4 â Walcott pasted his man right and
left on the face. "Bright Eyes" put his right
twice on Joe's jaw, but Walcott retaliated with
both hand? on Collins' face, nearly pushing
him through the ropes. "Bright Eyes" jabbed
his man with the left and uppercut him with
the right. Joe shot both lianas on "Bright
Eyes' " face and the southerner went down. A
hot rally followed.
Round 4â Walcott jabbed his man three times
with the left on the face and sent a hard right
on the bod}-. He kept after him and landed
right and left, but '"Bright Eyes" evened up
with \ corking right on the jaw. Just before
the gong sounded Joe pounded his man twice
with the left on the jaw. The Dell was sound
ing as Joe landed again and there were cries
of foul.
Round sâ Walcott forced his man to his
knees. "Bright Eyes" swung a hard right on
Joe's head. Hard fighting followed. They
clinciied and the referee stepped between
them. While the referee was between them
Joe swung his left hard on the neck, and the
house rose to a foul, but it was not allowed.
Round 6â Joe rushed at his man and floored
him six times in succession with right and
Wt swings on the jaw. The bell sounded and
paved "Bright Eyes" from a count out. He
was on the floor when the bell rang.
Round 7â "Bright Eyes" was groggy but
game. Joe landed a right on the jaw, and
the Texan we/it to his Knees. "Bright
Eyes" got up with a last despairing effort
and planted his right on Joe's neck. It
was only a flash in the pan. Walcott came back
at him like a wildcat. Five times Joe swung
fearful rights and lefts on "Bright Eyes'"
neck, sending him down, and each time
he got up groggier than before.
At last Watcott measured the dis
tance carefully, and with a fearful left-hand
swing on the jaw floored the Texan. "Bright
Eyes" fell on his back and turned completely
over. He put his face on his hands and lay
there with his limbs twitching. Before the
referee could count him out his backers threw
tip the sponge. The last round lasted two min
utes and fifty-five seconds.

thousand persons to-day attended
a meeting of the Salvation Army,

returned a few days ago from India, and
bidding God-speed to Mr. and Mrs. Booth-
Tucker, who will sail shortly for New

vation Army in the United States.
The principal feature of the meeting was
an address delivered by General Booth,
after which Mr. and Mrs. Booth-Tucker
were called to the front of the platform.
Two officers then lifted a large American
and Salvation Army flag over their heads,
which was followed by a remarkable,
unanimous outburst of cheering and clap
ping of hands.
General Booth then grasped the hands
of his son-in-law and daughter and in a
few thrilling words dedicated them to
their' new work.

workerâ simply as an auxiliary member,
as lots of other Christian people have
aone. I simply paid a certain amount
which made such a member. I thor
oughly believe in the work, as the army
reaches a class of people which no other
organization can."

Continued from First Page
Pacific road tinder section 3670 of the Po

of moneys alleeed to be due the State ior
taxes and thirteen counties of the State
in which the Southern Pacific road is ope
rated under the assessment made by the
State Board of Equalization for the pur
pose of State and county taxation for the
year 1887.
In deciding this case the Chief Justice
said :
"This court affirmed the decision of the

Pacific case, and this case is practically the
same."
Justices Field and Harlan dissented
from the decision.
WHAT THE DECISION MEASB.
Attorney-General Fitzgernld Bay the
2/trea Must lie Paid.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald, when seen
last evening, was busy preparing his argu
ment to be presented in the railroad case
in the United States court to-day, but he
delayed his work long enough to say:
"The dispatch from Washington an
nouncing the decision in relation to the
tax case is too meager to enable me to
make any extended statement as to the
merits of the decision, but it means this:
The railroads will have to pay their taxes
to the State. It means that they will have
to pay about $1,000,000 into the State
treasury, and it means that this is an end
to all quibbles about Federal franchises
and the like. This decision also means
that in the future the railroads will have
to pay their taxes."

Governor Drake's Daughter Will Christen
the Battleship.
DES MOINES, lowa, March 16.-Gov
ernor F. M. Drake to-night received from
Secretary of the Navy Herbert a formal in
vitation to attend the launching of the
battleship lowa, March 28, from the Cramp
shipyards, Philadelphia. An invitation is
also extended to the Governor's daughter,
Miss Mary Lord Drake, to christen the
vessel. The invitations will be accepted
and an lowa party will attend the ceremo
nies. The plan is to have the party, in
cluding the Governor, private secretary,
military staff of about thirty members in
uniform, leading State officials, and a
number of invited guests with ladies, go
iv a special train.
The launching will take place on Satur
day, and the train will leave here on
the Thursday previous, arriving in Phila
delphia on the morning of the day for the
ceremonies. After the launching and
christening the train will go to Washing
ton, and the party will make a call at the
Navy Department and, if possible, on the
President. It is also hoped to spend a day
in New York, if time will permit.
THAT BLUBJAT DEAL.
Many Complications Between Brokers
and Clients Will Ensue.
DENVER, Colo., March 16.â Broker
Randall successfully cleared at the Colo
rado Mining-stock Exchange to-day, and
as no other broker failed to meet bis obli
gations at the Clearing-house further trou
ble over the attempted Blue jay corner has
apparently been averted. Many complica
tions, however, remain unsettled between
various brokers and their clients. A num
ber of customers had left stock with bro
kers to be sold at stated prices. Owing to
the failure of three brokers to clear Satur
day the other brokers trading in Bluejay
were forcea to liquidate as best they could,
and they are now attempting to settle with
their respective customers accordingly.
The board of directors have decided to
hold an investigation upon the Bluejay
deal. It is stated that a conspiracy to de
fraud, and not a corner, was attempted,
and that interesting developments affect
ing not only Brokers Randall and Royer,
but the Lincoln Boy and the Bluejay Com
pany will be disclosed. However, the gen
eral opinion prevails -that Randall and
Royer schemed to make & corner on Blue
jay, and when in the excitement of Friday
Rover lost his head Randall protected him
self to the disaster of his associate.
The Mining Exchange has decided to
make a new list of stocks to be called, and
throw out all companies that cannot pass
a rigid inquiry.
Opposed for His Criticism.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 15. -The
opposition to the bill creating the office of
Lieutenant-General for Miles to fill is said
by the friends of the general to be out of
revenge for the way in which he criticized
the administration at the time of the
Chicago riots. His friends warmly support
the bill and say that he fuliy merits the
honor.

BA* JOAQUIIf LABOR EXCRaXGE.
Prominent Men Fledge Fund* in Sup
port of the Project.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 16.â The sec
ond meeting of those interested in the for
mation of a central labor exchange for the
San Joaquin Valley took place in this city
Saturday afternoon. About 150 persons
from almost every walk of life stand
pledged to become members of the organi
zation. The exchange will be chartered
under the Central Labor Exchange of the
State of Missouri and will be conducted on
the same lines as those of Loa Aiigeles,
San Jose and San Francisco.
Briefly stated the plan of these ex
changes is to handle the products of the
country through the medium of its diverse
membership and use labor exchange checks
instead of coin of the realm.
A committee was appointed at this meet
ing to secure the pledges of funds to start
the exchange and select a place where the
business shall be carried on. The by-laws
and form of organization were adopted.
The officers and directors will be elected at
a special meeting for that purpose to be
held on March 23. A large number of
ranchers and fruit-raisers of the county
have agreed to advance money to form an
exchange fund.

GREAT NORTHERN IN TROUBLE.
General Strike Threatened Because of the

SEATTLE, Wash., March 16.â Another
st-ike, growing out of the recent cut in
wages, is threatened on the Great North-'
crn road. The reduction appears to have
been more far reaching than at first sup
posed, and in some instances small bodies
of car-repairers (notably at Butte), have
walked out, while many agents have sev
ered their connection with the road by
resignation. Many old men along the
Western division are predicting that the

within two months.
SOUTH RIVERSIDE'S GAIN
Baron Harden-Hickey Gomes Into
Possession of the Cerreto
Estate.
Intends to Make His Country Home
One of the Most Beautiful in
California.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 16.â The
Daily Journal says Baron Harden-Hickey,
otherwise known as James I, reigning
monarch of the island of Trinidad, has
possessed himself of another principality,
the title to which Great Britain or other
foreign nations cannot dispute. The
baron has, through L. L. Bowen of this
ciiy, purchased of R. B. Taylor the beauti
ful Cerreto ranch at South Riverside.
The property consists of 130 acres under
the excellent irrigation system of the
South Riverside Colony. The land is
smooth and lies on a gentle sloping mesa,
being nearly level except for a butte that
rises to a commanding height near the
center of the property. On this eminence
are a large house, barn and reservoir.
There are 11,000 vigorous lemon trees, be
sides 7000 of other varieties and many
ornamental trees and shrubs. The place
is bordered by eucalyptus trees. Experts
estimate that the product of the ranch
will pay the purchase price in four years.
Baron Harden-Hickey is reported to be
very enthusiastic over the purchase. He
has announced that he will improve the
property to a high degree, and he expects
to have a country home ihat will not only
rival but eclipse the famous Srailev
Heights at Rtfdlands in natural beauties
and artificial embellishments. If the
Baron carries out his intentions he will
create a show place that people will go
miles to see. The price paid was $77,000.
By the terms of the deal R. B. Taylor
â¦akes in exchange a piece of property ad
ioining Senator Jones' residence at banta
Monica and the Baron's residence on Mag
nolia avenue in this city.
Tne people of South Riverside are pleased
over the purchase by the Baron, especially
as it is hoped that the father of the
Baroness, Henry M. Flagler, the Standard
Oil magnate, may invest some of his
millions in Southern California as he has
in Florida,
AMERICANS TO

Canada Will Protect the

Trade.
PROMPT ACTION LIKELY.
San Francisco Whalers Said to
Be Infringing in Hudson
Bay Territory.
CUTTERS MAT BE SENT NORTH.
Collector Milne Charges That the Amer
ican Schooner Fleet Is Abusing
Its Privileges.
VICTORIA, B. C, March 16.â Throueh
representations made to the Dominion
Government by Collector Milne steps are
shortly to be taken for the better protec
tion of Canadian interests at Herschell
Island, where, according to the latest re
ports, they are being infringed upon. As
a result of Milne's report the Government
will at once begin a systematic campaign
against the American fleet in Arctic
waters, and it is not unlikely that revenue
cutters will soon be dispatched to the
northern, island to lie in wait for any rea
sonable excuse upon which to make ar
rests.
Herschell Island is situated in Macken
zie Bay, at the mouth of Mackenzie River,
and affords the best winter quarters for
shipping in the whole of the Artie region.
It is, in fact, the only safe sheltering place
known east of Point Barrow. In the snug
little harbor, in the southern portion of
the island, whalers have long been known
to rendezvous in winter, but, it is claimed,
Americans have abused their privileges,
and the Dominion Government proposes
to cause them trouble. What method will
be employed has not yet been definitely
decided on, but it will be done effectually.
Seventeen whaling vessels â all American
and nearly every one hailing from San
Franciscoâ have this season wintered at
Herschell Island with damaging results to
the Hudson Bay Company's trade at Fort
Ferguson and the demorolization of the
Indians. This latter subject has been
brought to the attention of the officials by
letters received from the Right Rev.
Bishop Reeves and Rev. J. 0. String er
both missionaries in Northern Alaska. It
is claimed that the effect of the bad in
fluences of unscrupulous whites is tending
rapidly to the extinction of the natives.
The Hudson Bay Company's trade, car
ried on overland from Edmonton, has
been seriously injured by the competition
of whalers, which, instead of fitting out
annually, as was their custom until quite
recently, are now in the habit of equipping
for expeditions of three or even more
years, their supplies being replenished by
two steamers from the south, which go
north every year. Whisky and other
goods, particularly fancy articles, and
principally of worthless description, are
bartered off among the Indians, who in
return pay handsomely in furs.
It is estimated that 700 people passed
this winter at Herschell Island,
THE NEWS OF SAN JOSE
Edward Andrew Barron's Claim
to Be Passed Upon by
a Jury.
Ellen Sheehan's Mother Compelled to
Distribute the Sullivan
Estate.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 16. â Judge
Reynolds to-day set the trial of the suit
of Edward Andrew Baicon, the mulatto
claimant to the "Edward Barron estate, for
May 5. By consent the case is transferred
to the court of Judge Lorigan, who tried
the Barron will contest. The trial will be
before a jury, and the question at issue
will be, * : Has the plaintiff any heirs hip in
the estate at all?"
In reviewing the case Judge Reynolds
says there can be no distribution of the
estate until the will contest inaugurated
by George E. Barron is settled, but that
the matter can be expedited by submitting
the question at issue to trial at the time
named. The other questions involved in
the case will be tried by the court at a date
yet to be Hxed.
J. C. McKinstry, counsel for the San
Francisco Protestant Asylum, to-day filed
a notice that on March 23 he would ask
the court to quash and set aside the
original citation issued on April 10, 1894,
in the contest of Edward Barron's will, in
augurated by George E. Barron, in which
the persons interested were required to
show cause why the probate of the will
should not be revoked. The ground on
which the motion will be made is that the
citation was never served on the officers of
the San Francisco Protestant Orphan Asy
lum and that it was returned without
being served.
J. F. Devlin, attorney for Mary F. Bar
ron and her minor children, to-day filed
an answer to the mulatto boy's complaint,
in which it is denied that Edward Barron,
deceased, ever recognized the mulatto as
his child and contributed to his support.

Secure* a Distribution of the Eitate Left
by Her Father,
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 16.â Judge Bey
nolds to-day decided the suit of Ellen
Sheehan against Margaret Sullivan and
others, an action involving about $80,000
worth of property, in favor of the plaintiff.
The suit was brought by Ellen Sheehan,
who is a daughter of Margaret Sullivan, to
have a deed executed by her father, Michael
Sullivan, in September, 1887, whereby be
transferred a large tract of land and $45,000
worth of personal property to his wife, de
clared a trust deed and for a distribution of
her share.
Judge Reynolds held that the evidence
showed that the deed was a trust deed, and
that it was only intended that Mrs. Sulli
van should hold tne property during her
life, and that upon the death of Mrs. Sulli
van the property would revert to the es
tate of Michael Sullivan, deceased, and
then be distributed to his heirs.

HEALDSBURG, Cal., March 16.â The
cream tartar factory closed down to-day
after a continuous run of five months,
during which time 5000 tons of pomace

Before the next season opens the plant is
to be materially improved and enlarged,
so that all the pomace in Napa and So

MILLWOOD LAND CONTEST
Boyles, Lyfords and Defenbachs
Fail to Oust Casper
Gardner.
The "Squatter" Completes His Fence
Around the Seven-Acre Tract
in Dispute.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 16.âCas
per Gardner has completed his fence round
the disputed seven-acre tract near Mill
wood, on which he "squatted," and which
is claimed by the Defenbach heirs. Mean
time the airests of prominent men and
women â owners of land abutting on this
peculiarly located property â continue, but
Gardner still holds the fort.
The Defenbach htirs, claimants to the
disputed land, will bring suit through their
guardian, Dr. Lyford, in the Superior Court
of Marin County, for possession of the
seven acres, and will also sue the bonds
men of the constable who arrested ihe
women and men who tore down the fence
that Casper Gardner was erecting. The
constable made the arrests without a war
rant, and the women claim .that he acted
without authority. They intend to sue for
damages.
The constable, Eugene E. Gray, says
that it was not necessary to have a war
rant, as the fence-destroyers constituted
an unlawful assembly.
The property in dispute is under water
half the time because of its ' proximity to
the marsh. The cabin built by Casper
Gardner rests upon stilts, and the salt
water flows underneath. From a stand
point of value, the land is worth very lit
tle, but the Boyles, the Lyfords and the
Defenbachs are indignant that Casper
Gardner should bave "squatted" upon the
tract, and they intend to fight the matter
to the bitter end. Justice Fotbell is kept
busy issuing warrants of arrest which have
no effect. When the arrests are made bail
is immediately put up and the women go
back to pull up the fence again.
MRS. CLARA H. PERCY.
Yes, as I touched the bell of 45 Everett street, this City, a lady appeared at the
door with a warm, genial smile on her face that indicated home as I came within.
I had hardly conversed five minutes with Mrs. Clara H. Percy before I became
acquainted with the native humor and grace of this good woman. Woman is the
wordâ a motherly woman conveys the idea better. She told me much that was inter-
esting and true. She told me of her travels through the East and West Indies, of her
journey through Japan and of her delight with San Francisco. She told me at one
time she was in feeble health. She told me how much she searched for good health,
how difficult it seemed for her to obtain it. Then she told me the glad truth concern ,
ing the native remedy, Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
She said to me that she could never take mineral drugs Because mineral drugs
seemed to irritate her stomach. She told me that she could detect iodide of potassium
almost as soon as it reached her palate, no matter in what disguise or in what form or
shape it was in. She told me how glad she was that Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla con
tamed no mineral drugs, no iodide of potassium or stomach irritants. She said "that-
it did seem strange that while Edison could look through a block of wood six inches in
thickness, some people could not see the nose on their face," and she marveled how
people could take a remedy containing iodide of potassium, that produces pimples and
irritates the stomach, when they can just as well use Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla
which is as pure as the noonday sun. ,
These kind expressions were thrice welcomed, for not only were the words
glorious, the language eloquent, but the manner of conveying them was so kind and
motherly that even her most extraordinary expressions sounded sweet and refreshing.
Mrs. Clara H. Percy assured me that she did not improve in health until she returned
to San Francisco and until she began taking Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. She
mended from the first. Her stomach became a better digester, no pimples appeared on
her face, no uneasiness was experienced, and, said she, u tbe medicine is so nice to
take."
You can hardly call Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla a medicine because it is not
nasty. Try some of the other Sarsaparillasâ taste themâ they make you sick at the
stomach, and are quite likely to make you more sick if you continue taking them
Taste Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparillaâ you experience a gratifying sense immediately*
The palate is pleased and the effects of the remedy, especially on the bowels, is
remarkable. Taken in moderate quantities not the slightest bit of uneasiness can be
felt. Why, there is nothing in the remedy to gripe you. Before leaving Mrs. Percy
the good lady told me that she was happy to be able to recommend Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla, and, said she as a parting salutation, that she hoped the druggists aboug
San Francisco would stop endeavoring to substitute a nasty nostrum for the native
remedy, Joy's Vegetable Sarwparilia. HENRY TILLMAN.
SONOMA LOSES
A VALUED MAN
Isaac de Turk Passes Away
at His Santa Rosa
Home.
HAD LONG BEEN AILING.
His Death a Blow to the Viti
cultural Interests of the
State.
OWNER OF VAST VINEYARDS.
He Built the Largest Winery in the
World on His Guillicose
Valley Ranch.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 16,â Isaao
de Turk, one of the leading vineyardists of
the State, died in this city at 8 o'clock to
night, at the age of 62 yesrs. He had been
in ill health for some time, and his death
was not entirely unexpected.
Mr. de Turk was a native of Pennsylva
nia and came to California about twenty
five years ago. Since taking up his resi
dence here lie has been at the head of
many viticultural and agricultural enter
prises. His famous winery in the Los
Guiilicose Valley was long known as the
largest in the world, until the late Senator
Stanford caused to be built one of even
more mammoth proportions. His vine
yards covered thousands of acres, and his
Los Guillicose Valley home, fifteen miles
east of Santa Rosa, was a popular retreat.
Mr. de Turk was for years at the head of
the State Viticultural Association and a
member of the State Viticultural Commis
sion; was a prime mover in the organiza
tion of the San Francisco Board of Trade
and of the similar body in Santa Rosa ;
was connected with the Sonoma County
Horsebreeders' Association and the Agri
cultural Fair Association, the former or
ganization being the original owner of the
celebrated stallion Anteeo. He loved a
good horse, and many animals bred at bis
ranch have established enviable records on
trotting courses. One of his racers, Silas
Skinner, 2:19, is known to all American
turfmen.
In Santa Rosa the deceased took an ac
tive interest in every movement for the
town's advancement, and the Improve
ment Club had no more earnest member
than Isaac de Turk. In addition to his
Guillicose Valley interests, M. de Turk
was part owner in several vineyards in
other portions of Sonoma County.
Mr. de Turk never married! Though
possessed of an abundance of this world's
goods, he was content to journey through
life without a companion; but his home
was ever open and his hospitality was un
bounded. The only relative he is known to
have in the State is William de Turk, a
drug clerk at Petalurna.

Fate of Two Newspaper
Men No Longer in
Doubt.
DEATH FROM HUNGER.
Deserted by Indian Mail Car
riers With Their Larder
Almost Empty.
MINERS FLOCKING NORTHWARD
Steamers and Sailing Craft for the
Yukon Are Crowded With
Fortune-Hunters.
SEATTLE, Wash., March 16.â Alaska
advices received to-day by the steamer
Willapa report that L. S. Hodge and Wil
liam McNeelev, two white men who left
Juneau last December in company with
Jimmie Jackson, an Indian, and his as
sistants, who carry the Alaska Commercial
Company's mail from Juneau to Forty
Mile on* the Yukon, have undoubtedly
perished. Hodge was formerly employed
on the Juneau News, Lis companion, Mc-
Neeley, being a Silver Queen miner.
They were urged not to make the trip,
especially with the Indians, who are re
markably fast travelers. The party had
provisions for forty days, and Hodge had
600 pounds of newspapers and magazines
he was taking in to sell.
Jackson and his two half breed assistants
were met about a month ago by the
Cooper party at the foot of Lake Le Barge.
They had deserted their white companions
and were themselves in desperate circum
stances. Their faces were badly frozen.
When overtaken by the Cooper party
Jackson and his fellow-travelers had killed
ana eaten all their dogs, beginning on the
remaining quarter of the last hound, and
for several days had had only a spoonful
of flour to the man.
Hodge snd McNeeley nine days prior to
this had been left behind at Lake L.eslin
with only a half-sack of flour and some
beans. Their only possible chance of res
cue was at the hands of unfriendly Stick
Indians who may have happened along.
A party of Yukon miners, among them
L. Golden, arrived at Juneau on March 11,
having made the trip from Cicle City to
Juneau in the unusual time of thirty-eight
days, including a five days' stop at Har
pers. Golden congratulated his compan
ions upon the very favorable condition of
the weather this season, tne thermometer
registering only 60 degrees below zero.
George Moore, formerly of Seattle, who
came down on the Willapa to-day, says
laborers should give Alaska the go-by, but
that it is a good country for experienced
miners, provided they have some money
after reaching the gold fields. In Juneau
basin, Moore says, the snow is from fifty to
seventy-live feet deep, and mines cannot be
got into operation before May or June. He
believes it foolhardy for miners to go to
Alaska now, for the reason that they can
not cross the summit before May.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
steamer Mexico sailed from this port to
day with about 200 passengers, including a
part}' of thirty-three from Michigan and
Pennsylvania towns. During the next ten
days the schooners Ella Johnson, Helena
Winowah, Lizzie B. Prescott, Eutopia,
Rainier and L. J. Perry, and the *Lakme
and steamer Willapa, with passenger lists
of from twenty to tifty each, will sail from
Seattle to Alaska. The Mexico carried a
big cannery plant, to be established in
Alaska on the American side, near Buceda
Quadra village, about twenty miles from
Mary Island. On her trip down she
brought eighty boxes of fresh halibut,
taken by a fishing fleet which wintered in
Alaska.
Among the Alaskan vessels now in this
port is the steam schooner Excelsior,
which came in yesterday, having a party
of San Francisco and Oakland business
and professional men, who will seek wealth
in the gold fields of the north. They are
interested with an Eastern syndicate,
headed by Edward Guyebault. Among
the San Francisco and Oakland men are
Dr. C. H. Walker. R. K. Dunn, Alfred
Dutton and Dr. Rodgers. The Excelsior
will probably sail to-morrow.
ARGUMENTS AT CARSON.
Counsel in the Jones Case Review the
Testimony for the Jury's
Benefit.
CARSON, Nev., March 16.â The Govern
ment to-day decided to ask for a verdict in
the case of John T. Jones, the alleged bul
lion thief, on one countâ that of larceny.
United States District Attorney Jones be
gan the closing argument for the Govern
ment. He stated that in all his experi
ence he had never tried a case where iie
would have been more pleased to have dis
covered some proof of the defendant's in
nocence than in thi3 case. He had watched
anxiously for some ray of light to come
and prove the defendant blameless. He
would have welcomed such a showing, but
it had not come. The promised explana
tion of how suspect Jones came by his
wealth had never been forthcoming arid he
was compelled to believe in the guilt of
the accused as beyond question.
John Dennis followed the United States
attorney. He held that the Government
had failed to make out a case. The Gov
ernment's efforts, by its speculative, un
certain testimony, had left a wavering
doubt in the minds of the jury, a doubt
â¢which shonld clear the defendant. The
evidence of Mason and Noteware was all
speculationâ merely the opinions of these
men and nothing direct.
Attorney Woodburn will speak for the
defense to-morrow morning and General
Clarke will close for the Government. The
defense offered to waive argument and let
the case go to the iury, but the Govern
ment declined. The courtroom was packed
â¢11 day, even standing room being at a
premium.

Heckles* Land Sales Under a Concffsinn
frotn Jilexico.
LOB ANGELES, Cal., March 16.â The
International Company of Mexico ob
tained in 1885 a concession from the Mexi
can Government for the unoccupied Gov
ernment lands in the upper half of the pe
ninsula of Lower California under certain
conditions of survey and settlement.
These lands were sold recklessly to specu
lators, with little regard to conditions. F.
E. Bates of San Diego purchased Â» large
tract in and around Eusenadu, but after
ward, believing the title not vested in the
company, brought suit in the United
States (j'ircniit Court for the recovery of the
money paid. On November 29, 1892, a
judgment ar.l execution was obtained
against the company for $120,600, with costs
and interest.
Meanwhile the company, which had op
erated under a charter from the State of
Connecticut, disincorporated in the United
States and reorganized in London under
the name of the Mexican Land and Colo
nization Company, Jimited. The execu
tion under the Bates judgment was re
turned unsatisfied, the officers being un
able to tind any assets in the United States.
Therefore the Circuit Court to-day ap
pointed Clarence L. Barber of San Diego
attorney for Bates, with power to sue.
Suit 9 will be brought against the company
in London.
WATER FOR SAN DIEGO.
Voters of the Southern Town to Ballot Upon
the Proposed Purchase of a Complete
System.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 16.â The city
government, . after struggling with the
water question for many months, reached
a I unanimous conclusion to-night and
adopted a resolution approving of the
proposition of the Southern California
Mountain Water Company for the con
struction of the Morena dam, impounding
1000 inches, the conduit to the city and a
distribuiting system, all for $1,500,000.
The attorneys for the city were instructed
to draw up a contract forthwith for tho ac
quisition of the system, conditional upon
the voting of bonds in that sum r>y the
people. It is now believed the matter is
settled and that the people will soon have
a chance to vote upon the question of mu
nicipal ownership.
One reason for the unanimous vote to
night was the action of the San Diego
Water Company in bringing suit to set
aside the water rate ordinance lately
adopted by the Council, which was cal
culated to yield the company a reasonable
revenue (about $90,000), and praying the
court to make an order requiring the
Council to frame an ordinance yielding the
company $265,000 per year. This demand,
corning when the people were eager for
municipal ownership, completely swept
away opposition to the plans for an inde
pendent supply of water.
FREED AT SANTA ROSA
Bandit Gorton Walks From Jail
After Serving a Long
Term.
Judge Dougherty Dismisses the Last
Case Against the Clipper' Gap
Outlaw.
SANTA ROSA, Cal.. March 16.â H. L.
Gorton, the daring train-robber, was set at
liberty to-day. Gorton was tried and con
victed for the celebrated Clipper Gap train
robbery and sentenced to eight years in
San Quentin. The flight of time, the
Goodwin act and the good behavior of the
robber finally opened the doors of the
penitentiary and Gorton walked out a free
man, only to run into the arms of Sheriff
Allen of this county, who held a warrant
for him on. a charge of robbery.
On this charge, which was based upon
an old indictment, Gorton was brought to
this city and placed in the County Jail. It
is reported that he had about $8000 â the
proceeds of several robberiesâ cached in a
safe place, and as a second conviction
would undoubtedly result in another long
term in San Quentin, it was thought that
the robber would make a hard fight for
liberty. At any rate, Judge Eobert Fer
rall of San Francisco was retained by the
prisoner, and raised the somewhat novel
point that the District Attorney's office of
this county was cognizant of Gorton's
whereabouts within ninety days from tne
finding of the indictment, and should have
acted within that time.
Judge Dougherty of the Superior Court of
this county held that the point was well
taken and an order of dismissal was en
tered. Sheriff Allen refused to release his
charge without a certified copy of the
order of dismissal, which was furnished
after an hour or so of delay, and Gorton
at last left the Courthouse a "free man.

subjected them to a long examination.
Messrs. Clark & Gaddi9, attorneys for
Shephard & Collum, were present and
would not permit their clients to answer
any questions except such as they con
sidered pertinent and bearing upon the
matter of making proof of their claims.
Both Shephard and Collum swore that
the itemized statement of losses already
submitted was correct to the best of their
knowledge. It was rumored that they
would refuse to answer any questions on
the ground that they had been threatened
with arrest, on the charge of havinz them
selves fired the property, but no such point
was raised.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 17, 1896.
PORTLAND'S DEAD
MISER ACCUSED
Sensational Expose by the
Attorney for Two
Murderers.
AIDED SAYRES' SLAYER
W. 0. Allen Spent Thousands to
Free "Bunko" Kelly and
Lawyer Steeves.
DIED IN FEAR OF EXPOSURE.
The Counsel for the Pair Discloses
That Which the Prosecution
Failed to Prove.
PORTLAND, Or., March 16.â Lawyer
John Ditchburn, senior counsel for the
defense in the trials of "BunKo" Kelly and
X. N. Steeves for the murder of G. W.
Sayers in 1894, has begun suit for hia fees.
That has brought out the fact that the late
W. O. Allen, the man most interested in
Sayres' disappearance, spent $20,000 in the
defense of the accused.
When William O. Ailen was alive he had
property at one time estimated to be worth
nearly $150,000. This dwindled away in
recent years, partly by reason of a decline
in the value of real estate and by reason of
a more liberal manner of living enjoyed by
Allen. A part of his estate had to be con
verted into cash for use before and during
the murder trial. This was known to but
a few people at the time. When the time
came lor settling up the Allen estate and
his will, written by himself, was admitted
to probate there was some surprise over
the fact that the appraisers found only
$90,000 worth of property. In the last few
years of his lonely miserly existence it
appears Allen required a great deal more
money than in previous years. He died
on November 19, 1895.
During the two murder trials it was
daily expected that William â¢O. Allen
would be drawn into the case. His name
figured conspicuously in the evidence, and
incessantly did the State's counsel ham
mer away at the point, endeavoring to get
before the jury the motive for the killing
George W. Sayres. Indirectly it was at
tempted to show that Allen had formerly
been in business with Sayrea; that they
had a number of differences, followed by
lawsaits, and that behind all the mystery
Allen desired to have the community rid
of his old friend Sayres for a period at
least, so that he would have nothing to
fear from the lawsuits which were pend
ing. The evidence introduced on this point
âthe differences between Sayres and
Allen â was somewhat indefinite and only
a small part of the transactions was got
in evidence before the jury.
It Is now known that the Sayres murder
worried Allen incessantly until he was on
the verge of self-destruction several times.
He found it necessary to resort to drugs
for the sake of his nerves, and it was dur
ing a period of deep despondency over ill
luck and losses that Allen confided to a
confidential friend and adviser that during
his relations with George W. Rayres he
had got |10,000 the best of him, which
he feared he might have to pay back, and
the one fear of the man's life Up to the
time of his death was that he should be
cheated out of his hard-earned fort ane.
It is expected that Ditchburn will make
some startling disclosures.
FATE OF A BOGUS COUNT.
Dr. Hoenoch, Who Bunkoed Many Pacific
Coast Capitalists, Gets a Ten-
Year Term.
PORTLAND, Ob., March 16.â Gustav
Lagny, or "Dr." L. M. Hoenoch, bogus
count, trans-Siberian railway schemer,
brewer and inventor of Swedish punch
and a fakir of varied ability, whose
meteoric career in the Northwest is well
known, will give no more champagne
banquets to the gullible folk of the City of
Destiny or Seattle either. Dr. Hoenoch
was arraigned for sentence upon two in
dictments for larceny this morning and
was given rive years on each bill â ten years
in all. The only explanation offered by
Judge Stephens for the heavy sentence
was that the doctor, being a brainy man.
ought to have known better than to be
caught in such work. The doctor was
greatly humiliated. Hoenoch's commit
ment will be made Wednesday.
There is some glory in the Portland de
tective force in the capture of Hoenoch.
He came here from the Sound, where he
had been hobnobbing with capitalists,
railway men and politicians and having a
high old time. The fakir was penniless
when he landed in Portland. He chanced
his name, and in order to live for a few
days he turned "second-story worker" and
began stealing goods and articles from
business offices around town during the
absence of the occupants. He was prompt
ly captured and it was not long before his
identity w r as discovered. He had been in
Denver, Salt Lake, Spokane, Tacoma and
Seattle, and each of these places he had
left under peculiar circumstances.
About seven indictments for grand lar
ceny were returned against Hoenoch. He
pleaded guilty to two of them, and de
cided to avoid the trials. The remaining
indictments will be dismissed.

Mount Tamitlpnis Scenic Railway Cotn-
pany Hulked by I,and- Owners,
MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 16.â The
Mill Valley and Monnt Tamalpais Scenic
Railroad Company is having considerable
difficulty in securing a route from Blytbe
dale Canyon into Mill Valley proper. The
Mill Valley Property-owners' Protective
Association will fight the railroad in the
courts if any attempt is made to run upon
a public street without securing the neces
sary rights and privileges. The people
contend that the railroad will make the
avenue unsafe for people to travel upon.
It is now stated that a right of way
through the property of J. H. Mclnnes
has been purchased, but the members of
the Protective Association assert that they
do not intend to allow that, as the railroad
would still cross Corte Madera avenue,
and the objection would still remain. The
latest rumor is to the effect that the ter
minus of the mountain road will be Mill
wood station, about three-quarters of a
mile below Mill Valley, on the branch of
the North Pacific Coast Railroad. Those
that know say that eucn an arrangement
is not probable, as the expense of running
the line to that place and the erection of a
deDot and freightshcd3 would be too great.
The engine which was imported sometime
ago is still at Mill Valley on an improvised
track, and has not been in use on account
of the- trouble between the company and
the people along Corte Madera avenue.
SANTA CRUZ'S RUNAWAY.
Relatives of Myrtle Castella Unnble to
Locate the Girl or Her Actress
Friend.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March 16.â 1. L.
Thurber of this city denies any connection
with tbÂ« runaway of Myrtle Castella, who
left here on March 6 in company with
Lulu Hampton, a variety actress. He
Knew the girl, but says he did not go to
San Francisco with the two nor pay their
fares.
It was learned to-day that Myrtle and
the Hampton woman planned a scheme to
deceive her father by writing a bogus dis
patch signed John Blythe asking her to
come to San Francisco. She showed the
dispatch to her father and asked for
money for fare, but Castella discovered
the fraud and declined to give her the
money or his consent to goto San Fran
cisco. The men with whom the Hampton
woman came to Santa Cruz and the Cas
tella girl were in the habit of visiting
saloons here, and the girl's wayward char
acter has been talked of since she ran
away.
It was reported that the party would be
on the steamer Eureka, arriving here this
afternoon, eoing south, so Myrtle's
brother and her mother (now Mrs. Ander
son) delayed their intended trip to San
Francisco and met the steamer, but were
disappointed. Mrs. Anderson says she
tried to persuade the girl to go to school,
but she could not, and she attributes
Myrtle's waywardness to the fact that her
father works at night and is thus unable to
watch over her. She desires to see that
the girl is cared for if she can get her
back.
PUTNAM IS AT PORTLAND
The " Healer " Who Disappeared
From Victoria Now Living
in Seclusion.
Preparing to Open His Doors to the
Ailing Hordes Who Seek to
Be Made Well.
PORTLAND, Or., March 16.â Walter
Putnam, the "healer," who lately disap
peared from Victoria. B. C, and who off
and on for the past year was high priest at
the Home of Truth in San Francisco, and
who also established a faith-cure haven at
Santa Rosa, has been here for the past
week. His presence in this city was dis
covered to-night and a Call correspondent
visited hvn. Putnam was found snugly
domiciled in a private residence at 375
Alder street. He was averse to being ad
dressed as "doctor," saying:
"I prefer to be called Putnam."
When asKed as to his intentions and
plans in the north he said:
"I never make plans, but am guided
solely by the spirit and my Master. I live
for the day only and look not to thp mor
row. I may remain in Portland always,
and then 1 may be called hence to-mor
row. My temporal abiding place is the
earth and whenever the Lord directs me I
go."
"Do you effect your cures in the man
ner of Schlatter, the Colorado healer?"
was asked of Putnam
"My cures are effected through the
medium of Jesus Christ. I claim no per
sonal credit for anything I do," he re
plied.
Putnam said that his motive for keeping
in seclusion since coming here was for the
purpose of obtaining much needed rest.
So far his callers had been very few,
owing to the ignorance of the sicK, halt
and blind of his presence here. But after
the daily papers announce his arrival here
to-morrow nis rooms will no doubt be
thronped so long as be remains. He
remarked that he would exact no price for
curing the sick, as in that event it might
keep the poor and needy from seeking his
aid. He would keep a small wicker basket
on his table, into which patients could
place whatever sum of money they felt
disposed to contribute.
A QUEEN DOCTOR.
The Only Phyaiciau of Royal Blood In
the World.
Portugal ia the only country and this is
the only court in the world that can lay
claim to a doctor of medicine who is a real
princess by birth and a queen by rank.
She is not a "new woman," but a lady
bountiful born again into the nineteenth
century.
In New York society girls attend lectures
on "First Aid to the Injured." Some even
Btay through the parts where they are
shown how to tie up arteries and witness
real operations. But Queen Amelia,
daughter of the late Comte de Paris, has
gone further than this. For several years
she has earnestly and systematically de
voted herself to the study of medicine, and
now she has just received a degree from
the Eschola Polytechnica, the college of
the highest reputation here, which entitles
her to practice as a physician within the
limits of Portugal. "Yesterday she saw and
prescribed for her first patient.
At 10 o'clock yesterday morning the
people who live in the narrow, dirty, little '
Rua de Poco Novo were surprised to see a
brougham, with the royal arms on the
panel and drawn by two black stallions,
turn into their street and stop before No.
90, which is one of the most squalid tene
ments. The Queen got out, accompanied
only by her equerry, the Due de Louie, en
tered the low, dark hallway a3 unhesi
tatingly as if she had been there before,
and climbed three flights of creaking,
gloomy stairs to the apartment of Manoel
Valdes, which she found without apparent
difficulty. Where the passage was suffi
ciently wide the DuKe offered her Majesty
his arm. A groom stumbled up the
crooked stair behind them.
Manoel Valdes is a paralytic, an old
soldier, who has seen service in the colo
nies, and who lives on a small Government
pension. His wife died a long time ago,
and since then his little daughter, Castora,
now 13 years old, has taken care of him.
Lately the little girl has been ill of a fever
and expected to die. There was no one to
take care of old Manoel, and no money to
pay for a doctor for little Castora. As
soon as the Queen heard of their distress
she came to visit them, and the neighbors
say she has saved Castora's life. â Lisbon

MUST STILL. PAY TOLLS
Tourists to Yosemite Will Be
Asked for Tribute Outside
the Lines.
THE WEAK POINT IN A BILL.
Another View of the Plan to Sell
Tollroads in the National Park
to Uncle Sam.
There is now in the two houses of Con
gress a bill providing for the purchase of
all stage or wagon roads in the Yose mite
National Park, and although in its every
feature there is apparent sincerity of pur
pose, the statement has been made by
State officials that beneath tbe surface is
a scheme to get a large sum of money,
from the United States Government and
to continue leyying tribute on travelers
over parts of these same tollroads.
This was never suggested to the men
who worked conscientiously for the pur
chase of the Yosemite tollroads, and yet
the authority upon which it is claimed
that a plan to make a beneficial business
turn and still charge tolls over parts of
the roads can hardly be doubted.
J. L. Maude, U. E., a Commissioner of
the State Bureau of Highways, Baid that
the whole thing was simply purchasing
pieces of tollroads and leaving the other
portions still in the possession of the origi
nal owners. With such a condition tourists
to Yosemite could travel free through
the National Park, but to get in or out of it
would cost them probably as much as
before, since they would have to pay tolls
over the roads outside the park.
The principal road. is that used by the
Southern Pacific stage lines into the
Yosemite Valley, and, indeed, it is practi
cally the only one generally selected by
passengers who buy their tickets through
the Southern Pacilic offices. Tnese tickets
cost just so much now, and it is believed
that if the Government bought the
Yosemite roads and thus made a large
part of the route free to tourists, rates of
fare would not be reduced. Besides, the
road from Wawona, on the south line of
the park and outside the reservation,
would still be owned by private parties
with the result thÂ«t tolls would be charged
as of old. One bit of the road would be
free and another piece a tollroad.
In his report on the Yosemife Park John
W. Noble, Secretary of the Interior, ex
pressed himself in the following terms
upon the roads :
The Southern Pacific Railroad Company, in
conjunction with tue Yosemite Stage and Trans
portation Company '^headquarters at Wawona),
is doing everything in its power to discourage
travel into the Yosemite Valley, except by its
route via Raymond. Although they advertise
four different routea, they all lead over Ray
mond, and anyone desiring to take routes 3 or
4 will be talked out of it by being told that
the roads are very rough and dangerous.
The report describes the toll-roads in the
Yosemite National Park as follows: The
more northerly is the Big Oak Flat road,
thirty-three miles long, twenty of which lie
in the National Park. The toil on this road
is about Z% cents per person per mile, ana
the estimated cost $*G,650. The Coulter
ville road, thirty-seven miles long, enters
by the way of Merced Riyer valley.
Twenty-three miles of this road are in the
National Park. The toll ia about 3 cents a
mile, and the estimated cost $85,000. The
Wawona road, sixty-five miles long, with
twenty-live miles in the park, enters from
the southwest, and the tolls are about 2
cents a mile for each person. The esti
mated cost is $75,000. The portion of these
roads in the Yosemite Valley (the 36,111
acres within the National Park that are
under State control) is now owned by the
State of Calif onia.
A fourth road, Me Tioga, fifty-six miles
in length, runs clear across the park, north
of the f alley, for a distance of forty-eight
miles. The estimated cost is $62,000, and
the tolls about 2>% cents a person for each
mile.
The bill providing for the purchase of
these roads was introduced in. the House
of Representatives by Grove Johnson of
California, and is entitled "A bill author
izing the purchase by the United States
and the making free of the tollroads pass
ing over the Yosemite National Park." It
recites that four tollroads were built in
thfi park before its establishment, and that
ex-Secretary of the Interior John W.
Noble, in 1892, directed that an official ex
amination be made with reference to the
origin, right of franchise, condition, cost,
public convenience, etc., and that the re
sult of this examination was a report to
the United States Senate giving details
and recommending that the" Government
acquire title to the roads at their cost of
construction and make them free.
The bill continues:
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States of Amer
ica, in Congress assembled, that there is here
by appropriated, out of any money in the treas
ury not appropriated, the sum oi $268,050 for
tne purchase and making free of the. four toll
roads in the Yosemite National Park, as fol
lows : For the road of the Great Sierra VVagon
road Company, the sum of $62,000; lor the
road of the Big Oak Flat Turnpike Company,
the sum of $46,650; for the road of the Coul
terville and Yosemite Turnpike Company, the
sum of $85,000; for the road of the Yosemite
Stage and Turnpike Company, the sum of
$75,000. The purchase of said roads to be
made under the direction of the Secretary of
the Interior.
Sec. Is. That this act shall take effect from
and after its passage.
The bill has so far received favorable
consideration in both houses of Congress
and bids fair to pass at this session. It
was drawn up by Messrs. Wilson & Wil
son, the attorneys of this City, and is re
garded as a wise measure in the interests
of tourists to Yosemite. There are many
people, however, who believe that the bill
is but a half-way affair that will benentthe
tollroad companies by taking the roads iv
the mountains where winter storms do
great damage and are a constant cause of
expense. At the same time the portions
of roads more easily kept in repair will be
left in the company's hands outside the
park, and, as stated in ex-Secretary Noble's
report, the Southern Pacific controls the
situation, winch fact taken in conjunction
with the rest is considered particularly
significant. With the roads in the parK
free and under Government control the
tourist would still have to pay tolls to get
into the National Park, and on his re
turn from Yosemite would have to pay
tribute to get out.

SITE FOR A NEW CHURCH
Rev. P. J. Cummins Purchases
a Large Lot in the
Mission.
IT FRONTS ON THREE STREETS.
St. Charles Borromeo Parish Will Have
a Handsome Church on Sev
enteenth Street.
||Rev. P. J. Cummins, pastor of St.
Charles Borromeo at Eighteenth and Shot
well streets, has decided to have a hand
some new church edifice, schoolhouse and
dwelling in his parish. With this end in
view he has purchased a large piece of real
estate in the Mission and close to the pres
ent parish church as a preliminary step in
his project for an establishment that will
be worthy of the important and growing
pastorate of St. Charles.
The transaction through which Father
Cummins acquired the real estate was
conducted very quietly through O'Farrell
<fc Co. On March 2 an order confirming
the sale was issued from the Probate Court
to John J. O'Farrell.
The land belonged to the estate of John
L. Porter and was sold through George L.
Center, executor. It comprises part of the
block bounded by Folsom, Seventeenth,'
Shotwell and Sixteenth streets. Its front
age on Seventeenth is 245 feet, stretching
trom Folsorn to ShotweU, on which streets
the frontage is 140 feet â so there are three
large fronts, a very desirable feature for
the uses to which the site will be put.
The price is $23,400, subject to a mortgage.
Last Saturday Mr. O'Farrell transferred
the property to Father Cummins, subject
to a mortgage. At present there is a large
trunk factory upon the lot, and as the
works are in operation an income can be
secured from the investment until Father-;
Cummins is ready to remove the buildings
to make way for his parish edifice.
The parish church now standing onÂ»
block away at the northwest corner oi
Shotwell and Eighteenth streets is a com
bination of church and schoolhouse, hav
ing been designed as a temporary structure
that would meet all requirements. A por
tion of it is used also as a residence by the
pastor and Rev. W. G. O'Mahony, the as
sistant rector. This building was larga
enough to accommodate parishioners when
it was opened, but the parish has grown to*
such proportions in numbers the churcH,
and school are wholly inadequate to.
present demands and great inconvenience
is suffered by the people of St. Charles
parish for that reason.
The parish was established about nine
years ago, and for many months services
were held in the hall at Seventeenth and
HoTwird streets until the pastor was en
ablecKo build a suitable place of worship.
The seating capacity of St. Charles
Church is not much over 600. and now the
parish register has a list of 1200 families.
With masses at 6:30, 7:30, 9 and 10:30 a.m.
Sundays the church is overcrowded, and
at the later services the aisles and vesti
bules are filled. .The school for boys and
girls conducted by the Sisters of the Holy
Cross is similarly overcrowded, with about
280 pupils in all, and some classes have to
be provided for outside. The land occu
pied by the combined buildings is not
more than half the size of the lot just pur
chased.
Father Cummins announced recently to
his congregation that it was a matter of
urgent and imperative necessity to build a
large church, and he expected assistance
in the undertaking. The present building
will be converted into a schoolhonse) and
a magnificent house of worship erected on
the large lot on Seventeenth street.

THE FUR WILL
How the Stolen Document
Was Made and
Filed.
TWO DEMURRERS STAND
Bequest to the Teachers' Retire
ment F.und Declared
Invalid.
IT SAVORED OF A PERPETUITY
Dr. Marc Levingston's Contest to the
First Will Dismissed by Judge
Slack.
Another step has been taken in the Fair
Will litigation and arguments have given
place to testimony. Nearly all the attor
neys in the case were present in Judge
Black's court yesterday morning, as it was
rumored that he would decide the two de
murrers which have been pending. They
vere entered against the contests of Dr.
Marc Levingston, as an executor of the
pencil will, and the Board of Teachers'
Hetirpment Fund Com missioners, to the
probate of the stolen will.
Judge Slack announced from the bench
that he had understood that the attorneys
in the case expected a decision yesterday,
and while he had not had time to write an
opinion, he would decide the case from
the bench and give his reasons. He then
proceeded to review the points raised by
the demnrrers, and ended by sustaining
them both.
Regarding the demurrer to the contest
of Dr. Marc Levingston, he said the con
test was entered mid er the rule which
gives to those having the right to pro
pound a will for probate the right to con
test any will in oppositio n to the one they
offer. The right of any person interested
in an estate to contest, tinder the general
provisions of the codes, the court held to
be any person interested in the estate
itself and not one interested only in the
fees. An executor who may propound a
â¢will for contest has not the right of one
interested in an estate, and the power of
an executor to probate the will nominat
ing him seemed to the court to be Ins
measure of right to enter a contest of any
other.
So far as the points raised by the second
demurrer, the court said there was no
doubt that the bequest to the Teach
ers' Retirement Funcl was void, for it vio
lated the law forbidding perpetuities, and
that bequest was in the nature of a per
petuity. The gift was of personal property,
but nevertheless the court held that it
came under the rule ana therefore was
void. As to the point regarding the trus
tees, the court passed that point by, as
Judge Slack said the decision upon the
former point was sufficient to cover the
case. It was therefore, ordered that both
df raurrers,be. sustained and the contests de
murred t<> dismissed.
Judge Slack continued to the effect that
he was much impressed with Mr. Delmas'
argument against the demurrers, and as a
I'Hisequence he would like to have the two
matters heard together â that is, the pro
bate of the pencil will and the stolen will.
The sustaining of the demurrers, he said,
did not prevent the contestant Levingston
from submitting the pencil will for probate,
and then it would be possible to try both
cases and accept one will while reject
ing the other.
The proponents of the stolen will then
demanded that it goto probate, and Judge
Slack announced tnat he would allow that
course to be taken if there were no objec
tions. Mr. Delmas was sick and was not
present, so no objection came from him.
George Knight, the only otber probable
contestant, announced that he would not
object in the name of his client, Charles
Fair, and he would withdraw his contest
to the will, reserving, however, the right
to renew it at any time within the statu
tory year. He was allowed by the court to
â withdraw his contest without prejudice.
iir. Pierson then took a fat roll of type
written pages from the desk and called
Thomas J. Crothers to the stand. Mr.
Crothers told how he had been appointed
an executor, and how he went to the
County Clerk's office the morning after
Senator Fair died, and with Angus and
Bresse, filed the will lor probate. He told
of taking a certified copy of the document,
and swore that the one handed to him for
identification was an exact copy of the
original will. He said that Senator Fair's
estate consisted of real estate of the ap
proximate value of $6,000,000. yielding an
income of about $325,000 a year, and per
sonal property to the value of $6,000,000
more. The total value, he said, was ap
proximately $12,000,000.
James S. Angus, another of the execu
tors, followed Mr. Crothers to the stand.
He told of the signing of the will. It was
about 11 o'clock in the morning on Sep
tember 21, 1894, that L. C. Bresse, L. W.
McLaughlin. George Whittell, William M.
Pierson and himself gathered in the office
of Senator Fair, and the Senator asked
Whittell and McLaughlin to witness his
â will. They did so, and then giving the
will, which he had sealed and marked, to
Bresse, the Senator told him to put it in
his own private safe, and he told the wit
ness to go with Bresse and see that he did
so.
Angus saw the will again on November
2<>, 1894. He was called into Fair's office,
and was handed a slip with a memoran
dum of section 1307 of the Civil Code upon
it. Fair asked Angus to read the section,
and then asked him if there had been any
provision made in the will regarding a pos
sible widow or child of James Fair, the
Senator's deceased son. Fair asked, also,
if there had been any provision made re
garding possible illegitimate children of
Lis own. Angus was not certain, and it
was deemed advisable to call in Mr. Pier
son. He advised that the question be set
tled by opening the will again, and in the
presence of Bresse, Pierson and Angus
Fair onened the will and handed it to
Pierson to read. It was found to be all
"At the same time Pierson produced an
agreement or declaration of trust which
Fair had ordered him to draw up, and
which set aside $50,000 to be held in trust
by the executors to probate and uphold
the wiil There had been a similar decla
ration of trust made in regard to a will
made by Fair in 1892, but this was revoked
and a new one drawn up to refer to the
will of September 21, 1894. This declara
tion set aside iilty $1000 bonds of the
Northern California Railroad, the pro
ceeds of which was to be used as directed.
Fair signed this declaration of trust, and
at J'iersons suggestion the will, the decla
ration and the bonds were put together in
an envelope, and with his own hand Fair
wrote on the sealed covers, "Last will of
James (i. Fair." .
Continuing, Angus said he frequently
conversed with Fair on the subject of the
will of September 21. Fair said that in
case of his death Angus was to hie nis will
for probate at once. If he died after 4
o'clock in the afternoon Angus was to be
at the County Clerk's office the next morn
ing. Angus remonstrated, but Fair said
he had never cared for sentiment in his
life and he did not see why lie should
after death, and if Angus did not file the
will at once he would find some one who
would.
Fair said he wanted his estate to go to his
children and he did not want the Public
Administrator to get his hands on it;
therefore he wanted the will riled at once.
On .December 24, 1894, Angus saw the Sen
ator again. "I'm dying," he had said to
Angus, "and I wain you to remember
your promise about tiling that will.'
L. C. Bresse. Edward Oliver, George
Whittell, C. W. McGlauflin and William
M. Pierson were all called, and each cave
the same Ftory over. Pierson was the last
Witness. He "drew the will himself, he
said, and he knew of ihe tiling of it.
"Do you know where it is?" asked Gar
ret McEnerney, who was questioning him.
"Well, it has been proved that it is not
in the clerk's office."
â¢â¢Do you know the copy?"
"I do."
The testimo ny was all in, but before de
ciding the case Judge Slack will hear argu
ments on the position of the proponents
of the pencil willâ that is, how far they
can go in cross-examining the witnesses
heard yesterday, and how far they can go
in their opposition.

TWENTY TONSORIAL TYROS
All Learning to Strop and Shave
at the Wilson Barber
â¢ College.
The Latest Addition to the Numerous
Educational Institutions of
the City.
No one can now plead poverty as an ex
cuse for appearing abroad without a nice,
clean shave. Like Wisdom in the script
ures, the genial young proprietor of.the
Wilson Barber College invites all earth's i
unshaven ones to come to him for relief
"without money and without price." The
college is situated in the lower floor of the
building comprising 1511, 1513 and 1515
Howard street, occupyingan area intended
for three stores. Here men who need and
want a shave are attended to free of charge
by the pupils of the college. The custom
ers are naturally in reduced circumstances j
or, as the college circular euphoniously
phrases it, "Our subjects, to practice upon,
come from the army of the unemployed."
Entering the college at No. 1511 the vis-
I itor finds himself in a sort of pen, com
i passed about by a wire fance perhaps a
I yard high. The adornments of this apart
i ment are limited to a number of placards
bearing such legends as "All Work Done
Free of Charge," Shaving and Hair Cut
ting Free," "Blind Men and Cripples Need
Not Await Their Turn," and other an
nouncements of similar import. In the
pen yesterday when The Call man, un
happily already shaven, visited the col
lege were a number of men waiting to be
attended to. As might be supposed, their
I appearance denoted that the world was
\ not using them as well as it could, but no
i vicious or criminal-looking faces could be
seen. The men were ranged on the benches
in the order of their entrance and were as
quiet as though in a church.
A gate in the pen opens into what may,
perhaps, without offense, be styled the
operating-room. Here are twenty-five
j barber-chairs, ranged on either side" of a
i table extending the entire length of the
apartment. Most of the chairs were occu
pied, there being twenty students at work.
The patients, so to speak, were enveloped
in cloths of bright blue, covered with large
w T hite fiowers, strongly resembling in de
| s-ign the parrions or breech clouts of the
Tahitian islanders. The faces of the cus
tomers wore an expression of resignation
which was truly touching. After endur
ing for years the hard knocks of a cruel
I world it is, perhaps, a comparatively easy
i thing to submit even to the caresses of an
amateur barber. An occasional groan,
they say, is heard, and rumors are rife
! that at times wild oaths rend the rose-oil
j scented air, when perchance some razor is
j found to have more than its proper share
i of "nicks": but these demonstrations are
of rare occurrence.
Beyond the workroom is the dormitory,
where some of the students sleep on com
fortable-looking cots, and in the section
corresponding to No. 1515 is the office of
[ the proprietor, C. W. Wilson. Mr. Wil
son was out yesterday afternoon, but the
head master, W. S. Budlong, an agreeable
; young gentleman with a Paderewski ban g,
was glad to speak about the work of the
! college.
'â¢You would be surprised," he said
among other things, "to learn how
quickly our students maÃter the tonsorial
art. 1 suppose the poor subjects wince a
little when they fall into the hands of a
beginner, but after a week or so most of
the students are able to shave a man with
out causing him any pain. It then be
comes a question of speed, and we find
that eight weeks is enough time for any
one of ordinary intelligence to attain a de
gree of proficiency enabling them to shave
a customer quickly, painlessly and well.
"We are prepared to admit lady stu
dents," continued Mr. Budlong, "though
we have nona at present. Several, how
ever, are expected, and I have noticed that
women make first-class barbers with very
little instruction. Practice seems to be
what they most need, and the theory of
the business seems to come natural to
them."
At this juncture a lad appeared . at the
office door and asked the head master to
give him some directions for the dispatch
ing of an unusually stubby "subject."
The tonsorial pedagogue prepared "to: go
with his promising disciple, but as he
wished his visitor a cordial ;au revoir re
marked:;, ..:-,â ; -,^- â -- â  ; â¢ :
"I forgot one thing. We present all our
graduates with a complete outfit, consist
ing of two Sheffield razors, strops, comba,
brushes, shears, razor-hone and case as a
souvenir of the college."
Dislocated Her Jaw.
Mrs. Davis, an old lady, living at 582 O'Far
rell street, sat down to read the Chronicle
yesterday morning and soon fell asleep. The
paper slipped from her hand and the noise
awakened her with a start. Sne yawned so
vigorously that she dislocated her jaw, and it
required the combined efforts of Drs. Bunnell
and Rinne and a liberal use of chloroform at
the Receiving Hospital to reduce the dis
location.
The production of olive oil in Cephalonia
is very considerable, a good crop yielding
25,000 to 30,000 barrels, or 480,000 English
galions; but more than three-fourths goes
in to local consumption and only one-fourth
is exportedâ almost exclusively to Russia.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 17, 1896.
THE THIRTEENTH JUROR
Startling Instance of a Judge's
Power in the Muhlner
Case, Oakland.
MAT FREE A HOMICIDE.
Verdict of Manslaughter Set Aside,
Because the Evidence Pointed
at Murder.
The case of Louis A. Muhlner, now
about to come before the Supreme Court,
presents a rather interesting instance of
the effect of that rule which the higher
court itself has laid down concerning the
right of a Judge to set asid e the verdict of
a jury.
Louis A. Muhlner was tried in the crim
inal court of Oakland for murder and was
found guilty of manslaughter. Judge
Frick granted a motion for a new trial on
the ground that there was no evidence for
the verdict of manslaughter, while there
was sufficient evidence for a verdict of
murder.
The prosecution has appealed to the
Supreme Court from this ruling. It alleges
errors on'the part of the court, and is con
fronted with the alternative of winning its
point on appeal in face of a ruling of the
Supreme Court or trying for a second con
viction of manslaughter, also in face of a
ruling of the Supreme Court. So the
prosecution is working to hard lines any
way one looks at it, while a man convicted
of unlawful killing seems to stand in a fair
wav to go scot free.
T*he situation is this: Muhlner was
charged with the murder of his sweetheart.
The jury brought in a verdict of man
slaughter. That released him of the graver
charge. The court set aside the verdict on
the ground that "there was evidence suffi
cient to warrant a verdict of murder, but
not evidence sufficient to warrant a verdict
of manslaughter."
If the Supreme Court sustains the lower
court it will result in setting a convicted
murderer free. If the Supreme Court
shall say, as has the lower court, that
there is "not sufficient evidence to warrant
a conviction on the charge of man
slaughter, the prosecution will have no
recourse but to set Muhlner free, despite
the fact that in the opinion of Judge Frick
he is guilty of murder.
Lawyers" are citing this case as a most
startling exposition of the effect of con
ferring upon the Judge of a trial the power
to set aside the judgment of a jury.
Assistant District Attorney Church, who
conducted the prosecution and prepared
the proposed bill of exceptions, while agree
ing with the court that there was sufficient
evidence to warrant a verdict of murder,
holds that there was also sufficient evi
dence to warrant a verdict of manslaughter
if the jury had a doubt as to the premedi
tation of the crime. The bill of exceptions
therefore claims that the court erred in
setting aside the verdict. All the cvi
i dence is set forth in the bill, together with
j numerous citations of law to sustain the
position. The evidence is all circumstan
tial, but forms a complete chain, sufficient,
! as 9tated, to convince Judge Frick of the
guilt of the defendant of the higher crime
of murder, and the jury that hetiad done
the killing.
The murder was committed last August.
Louis A. Muhlner was engaged to marry
Jennie Lewis, the murdered girl. She was
employed as a domestic with the family of
Dr. George Moore, Edwards street, Oak
land. Muhlner had met Miss Lewis at a
country place two years before and fallen
deeply in love. She came to Oakland
shortly after, as did he, and they became
engaged. In August he invited ncr to ac
company him to a ball at Point Olema,
Mann County. She consented and he sent
her some money for a new dress for the oc
casion. He was to meet her there. He
went, but did Dot rind her. She sent him
word the next day that she had been un
able to get her dress in time.
She had told him some weeks before
that she was keeping company with a
young man named Charley Miller, and
gave him the impression that she thought
well of him.
When his sweetheart did not come
Muhlner remembered this, and the bn'l
had no further interest for him. He
started to walk to town that night over a
lonely rode and arrived next morning at
San Rafael, where he visited the young
woman's parents, found she was nottbere,
and left, saying he would ''fix her" so that
she wouldn't keep company with Miller or
acybody else. He learned that his sweet
heart was to attend a ball at Germania
Hall, Oakland, that evening, with Miller.
He went to the ball and saw them to
gether. He talked to the young woman,
told her she must not go with Miller â that
he was a hoodlum â and, taking her by the
arm, insisted that she go with him. She
broke away from him.
Next day the young woman received
word that. Charley Miller was lying sick in
a certain room in a certain hotel, and
wanted her to come to him. She hastened
to the place, but found Muhlner there in
stead, not sick, but eager to plead with her
to forsake Miller. He did not threaten
her. She left him.
The next night she was seen standing
on tho porch at the rear of Dr. Mooar's
residence in company with a young man
who was at the trial described as closely
resembling Muhlner. At 4 o'clock the
next morning her body pierced by two
bullets was found at the foot of the stairs
in the yard.
Search was immediately instituted for
Muhlner, and he gave himself up to the
San Francisco police, saying he under
stood they were looking for him. He de
nied knowing anything about the murder.
A package of hn own letters written to
Miss Lewis was found upon him, but he
said he had visited and secured these let
ters from her some hours previous to the
time of the shooting, and was not in Oak
land that night. He was, however, seen
at the Newland House combing his hair a
half hour after the time of the shooting,
which was about sufficient to allow him to
get there from the scene of the killing.
Tnis is a resume of the evidence upon
which the jury found a verdict of man
slaughter, which verdict Judge Fnck has
set aside. The appeal will come before the
Supreme Court in a few days.

erature and everything pertaining to human
speech, without love is only so much noise,
compared to brass instruments and cymbals.
So with prophecy, knowledge, faithâ all, with
love eliminated, are worthies!!. â Rev. D. C.
Garrett, Episcopalian, Seattle, Wash.
GRF.AT MEN.
There are four great characters the world can
not forget. Oliver Cromwell; William, Prince
of Orange; George Washington and Abraham
Lincolnâ all manly men, religious men, patri
otic men. Each brought somethine to pass and
erected his cwn monument.â Rev. T. G. Dick
inson, Methodist, Columbus, Ohio.
BROTHERHOOD.
We seek as much as possible to minify de
nominationalism and magnify Christianity.
Our name, United Brethren in Christ, stands
for fellowship, brotherhood and union, the
trinity of power, which will win back the surg
ing masses that have gone astray. â Rev. J. S.
Kendall, United Brethern, Cleveland, Ohio.
PRAYER.
The highest earthly attainment is prayer,
Mr. Moody says he would rather pray like
Daniel than preach like Gabriel. Christ taught
his disciples how to pray, but never how to
preach. True prayer must be fervent. This
implies a hopefulness that expects an answer.
âRev. W. J. Mosler, Baptist. Brooklyn, N. Y.
THE LIQUOR QUESTION.
The saloon cannot be mended: it must be
ended. The evils of the saloon exist. The al
ternate is not necessarily prohibition. Some
means can be provided, perhaps along the
lines of the South Carolina movement, to sup
ply the reasonable demand for liquor.â Rev.
F. W. Hamilton, Universallst, Boston, Mass.
THE HOME.
The Christian in his home is the inaex to
his character of the man in every other rela
tion in life. His whole character is there re
vealed. There is no place in which one's
character is more potential and more im
portant than in the home.â Rev. Henry H.
Waters, New Orleans, La.
BALOOX-KEEPERS.
We shall not avert the evils of intemperance
by making saloon-keepers respectable. The
business stiould be outlawed everywhere. In
Kansas the liquor-seller is a criminal, and we
must see to it that our laws never put any
higher touch of respectability on him than
that.â Rev. H. W. Chaflee, Me"thodist, Girard,
Kans.
FEAR.
The fear of being hurt doesn't count with
God. The Christian must expect to be hurt.
His Master was hurt, and every true disciple
has been hurt from his time to the present.
We need never hops to wear the crown if we
are unwilling to bear the cross.â Rev. John
Evans, Baptist, Westerly, R. 1.
DANGERS OF WEALTH.
Those with wealth and power oppress the
poor and weak to an extent almost beyond be
lief. The French Revolution was * huge bon
fire, in which everything was tumbled to make
a blaze to illuminate the darkness of the times.
The world had better look out or there will be
other bonfires.â Bishop Keene, Catholic, Wash
ington, D. C.
PATRIOTISM.
True patriotism will lead men to purify the*!r
own lives. Every criminal, every aebaucher,
is a blemish upon his country. Every pure
man, every scholar, every true man adds to
her greatness. The country called lor soldiers
once. True patriots responded. To-day she
calls for pure, earnest, honest men. Truest
patriots will again respond to her call.â Rev.
Johnston Myers, Congregationalist, Chicago.

WASHINGTON.
Washington's religious life was humble but
deep, and throughout his life he was a devoted
communicant of the Protestant church. On
all proper occasions he acknowledged the su
preme power of the Lord, and it was the arm
of his God that supported him through his
eight years of political life.â Rev. J. D. PicKles,
Methodist, Boston, Mass.
IMMIGRATION.
One of the most awful dangers menacing
this land to-day is that, while Congress is
building up our tariff walls so high that no
foreign goods can come into the domestic
market, yet at the same time it leaves some of
the lower boards of the fences down, through
which are crawling from European sewers all
the ignorant, stenchful, filthy, immoral, an
archistic and criminal rascals. Before for
eigners are allowed to vote they ought to pass
through a twenty-one years' apprenticeship.
We ought to dam back that scum as we would
a plague.â Rev. F. DeWitt Talmage, Presby
terian.
REVERENCE.
Reverence Is the key that unlocks the mys
teries of the world. Only in reverence can we
work with any sincerity and earnestness.
There is a tendency to lay aside reverence as a
thing not to be cultivated. Our Government,
our hopes of free institutions, are based on
reverence for man. If we would save this
Government and hand it down with all the
liberties connected with it, we must learn first
cf all to reverence our fellow-men, and we get
our first lesson at home by learning to rever
ence ourself.â Rev. Calvin Stebbitis, Unitarian,
Worcester, Mass.
CATHOLICS AND METHODISTS,
The Roman Catholic, in common with
Christian churches generally, is built upon the
foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus
Christ himself being the chief cornerstone.
VYhcn we Protestants go below what we con
sider their human additions to the doctrine of
Christ and the apostles, we find we are at one
with them upon such fundamental truths as
that of sin, atonement, regeneration, judg
ment, heaven and hell. As Methodists, we far
more nearly agree with Roman Catholic
teaching upon some points than we do with
the Calvinfsts. We, therefore, recognize them
as fellow-citizens with the saints and of the
household of God. â Rev. J. C. Jackson, Metho
dist, Columbus, Ohio.
WAR AND ARBITRATION.
A Christian nation should exemplify Chris
tian qualities iust as much as the Christian
individual. The time has come to insist on
national or international morality. A na
tion has no right to make war, except it be
in defense of honor, any more than a private
individual has to make war on his neighbor.
These are principles of national morality
that need to be insisted upon in these days,
and we of this country are in a position to
plead for them because we have made our
acquisition of territory thus far, not by vio
lently stealing, but by purchase. We have
cone to war only when our independence,
our honor, or our very existence was at
stake. Now the way to bring about some
such cessation of national wrong and na
tional war would seem to be by arbitration.
To settle questions by war is to resort to brute
force. To get them before an impartial tribu
nal is to call in reason and justice.â Rev. Reese
F. Alsop, Episcopalian, Brooklyn, N. V,
THE NEW CITY CHARTER.
John M. Reynolds Declares the
Document Is Not Broad
Enough.
AS TO SCHOOL TEACHERS.
An Answer to Ernest McCullough on
the Question of Public
Utilities.
John If. Reynolds contributes the fol
lowing letter on the subject of the new
charter, answering particularly an Exam
iner editorial on the question of the school
teachers, and Mr. McCullough's letter a 9
to public utilities:
To the Editor of the Callâ Beak Sir: Re
lying upon your disposition to deal fairly with
the friends and opponents of the new charter,
I offer a response to an editorial of the 14th
inst. published by the Examiner. It reads
thus: "It would appear that the greater part
of the work in advocacy of the new charter
would be found in correcting errors of state
ment in regard to its provisions." Then lam
taken to task for stating that all th* teachers
of our public schools must bs graduates from
the public school system of this State. In
using the words "all" a mistake was undoubt
edly made. The statement should have been
that 'yearly all" the teachers must be gradu
ates of California!! schools. Since of all the
teachers' positions in our primary and pram
mar classes (numbering 904) only 54 positions
are left open to citizens (from other States),
according to the new charter my statement
does not seem to be very erroneous. It was a
slight error, I admit, but hardly worthy of the
comment it received. The Examiner seems to
consider such provisions to be proper. Its
tastes have been perverted lately if it is in
clined to depart irom the Democratic idea in
such an important matter as free opportunities
to the best teachers to be obtained for our
children. I maintain such a policy as the new
charter's boycott is not wise, patriotic or j ust.
No person or newspaper can consistently lay
claim to patriotism while advocating such sen
timents. Washington's warning against sec
tionalism seems iorgotten, in practice, when
such provisions as that under consideration
are approved. Newspaper- could no longer be
considered honorable if they advertised our
"climate, fertile soil and unbounded re
sources" in a New Year's edition to allure im
migrants (capaDle of teaching:), and at the same
time be striving to curtail their opportunities
to live honestly after they are here. Is It pos
sible that "the struggle for existence" has so
sensitized the preÂ«s that it yields to a false
principle of short-sighted selfishness? Where
is this industrial strife (expressed, by the pro
vision against teachers from other States in
the new charter) to end? At one time the cry
is against the people of the East, as in this
case. Next they will be enticed to come into
the State by the same persons and papers that
are loudest in endeavoring to enact stringent
measures against their welfare should they
come. Such is the spirit of that section of the
new charter which forbids the employment of
any one in the primary or grammar classes
who is not a graduate of our State schools.
I appeal to my fellow-citizens for mag
nanimity, for more love of country, and
for justice. The approval of such provisions
as that, of which we now write, means disin
teeration of society. It would be a fearful im
peachment of California's noted generosity
and hospitality and of our social conditions,
if a charter should be approved with such un
patriotic restrictions within it.
Reason, also, should dictate otherwise. The
boycott of good Eastern schoolteachers means
that Eastern people will make reprisals and
boycott us nnd our friends. Certainly W. R.
Hearst could not justly expect patronage for
his New York paper among New York people
if he uses the means which may be gained by
their patronage there to the disadvantage of
all New Yorkers here. "We must take broader
views," says an Eastern paper, in an article re
ferring to California's present attitude. The
boycotting of good Eastern teachers is a two
edged sword that it is not best to fool with.
The new charter loses dignity and strength by
such a small piece of business.
Again the Examiner states that "Mr. J. M.
Reynolds, who is at present the only active
and open opponent of the instrument" (the
new charter), etc. This is hardly true, since
the Trades Union Convention of February 16
declared itself opposed to it, and that action
has been ratified by many of the unions rep
resented. This means that there are thou
sands arrayed against the new charter. Its
champions represent more dollars, but are not
very strong numerically. Does the ring of the
merchants' dollars make so much more im
pression that the voices of thousands are un
heard and unnoticed? Is the voice of the 337
merchants of more significance than the fol
lowing resolutions, adopted by the Trades
Council Alliance, which represented thou
sands of voters? I quote the resolutions
passed February 16:
"Resolved, That we denounce the proposed
new charter as perpetuating the infamous and
wasteful contract system and making it com
pulsory on future civic authorities; also for
its provisions directly against the rights and
interests of labor, in that it does not provide
for the initiative, referendum, proportional
representation or any means whatever for
insuring government of the people instead of
by bosses.' 1
That is my answer to the statement that my
position is a solitary one. It emphasizes the
claim that the fight over the new charter will
be one of "flesh Versus property"â the peeple
against the monopolies. Since I have candidly
acknowledged the correction in regard to a
small fraction of the school teachers, will the
Examiner not be equally candid and frankly
admit that the new charter does contain many
grave and serious obstacles to municipal own
ership which are not foniDd in the existing
statutes? If so the public can safely be left to
judge as to the advisability of adopting an in
strument so dangerous to the future develop
ment of this City. The public should not be
misled by claims that the new charter ad
vances the possibilities of acquiring public
water and light works when the facts are to
the contrary.
In this connection let me briefly answer
Ernest McCullough's letter, published on the
15th lnst. The gentleman will excuse me for
using his own words against him. It is done
to snow that such words are not appropriate.
He might be called (uo disrespect intended)
another "ill-advised agitator" who "has gone
into print" and informs the public that he is
"neither a lawyer nor a jurist, so cannot say,"
but he "believes" there are many difficulties to
public ownership existing now which the new
charter would brush aside. He believes in
agitating for the new charter and other things
favored by the Merchants' Association, but
seems to think other men should not exercise
the "American right of thinking for them
selves" and agitate against it or for other
things.
He admits that the new charter imposes
limitations upon the Board of Supervisors and
he calls them "safeguards." "Safeguard No.
1" is the provision that the Supervisors must
tÃke into consideration the existing plants if
they can be acquired at the same price that
new works could be built. The corporations
would like to have the new charter read that
their plants should be bought at their price,
but as that would be audacious a clause was
slipped in to the effect that they must be con
sidered if they can be acquired on the same
terms as new works could be constructed. So
their minds would be easy if the new charter
passed. They could go on with their extortion
with the satisfaction that if it ever came to "a
show-down" they will ra'-e in their stake any
way. That is "safeguard No. 1" (for them).
The '"Safeguard No. 2" (according to the
same authority) is that three-fourths of the
Supervisors must affirmatively vote in favor of
submitting a proposition for public ownership
to their employers, the people, before it can be
done. The "associated villainies" do not want
to lose their monopolies, and would have pre
ferred that it were made necessary that all
twelve of the Supervisors must vote affirma
tively before the people could acquire works
of their own. This, however, would have been
too barefaced. So they will be satisfied with
the provisions of the new charter, which will
enable them to obstruct the people's wish by
controlling four of the Supervisors. The above
men tioned gentleman has the simplicity to
assert that is another "safeguard" for the peo
ple and calls it "Safeguard No. 2." These lim
itations seem tome to be nil in the interest of
the existing monopolists. The restric
tions are greater than our present laws
prescribe, and yet the advocates of
the new charter say it will assist
the movement toward public ownership. If
the present constitutional provisions which
require that "two-thirds" of the voters must
approve of a bond issue were changed so as to
read that "three-fourths" of the voters must
approve, such a restriction would make it
easier to issue bonds according to their line of
reasoning. However, having secured an ad
mission of these facts, that it requires nine
Supervisors to be (with the people) against the
monopolists and that even then the monopo
lists must be given consideration under the
new charter, let us pass to the other damaging
feature. It has been claimed by myself that,
since all propositions and estimates regarding
the purchase or construction of public works
must be made by the Board of Public Works
and approved by them before they can be sub
mitted to the people, and since the new charter
provides that every member of the Board of
Public WorJta most approve oi every order or
estimate recommended by them, that this is a
very serious obstacle In the way of public
ownership.
My opponent claims that this assertion is "ft
misstatement, unwarranted and mischievous."
Let the words of the new charter speak to the
public. Since he does not quote a line of the
instrument to prove his charge, I will quote,
verbatim, and will await the gentleman's
apology.
Article 11, chapter 2, section 64, reads thus:
The Board of Supervisors may enter into nego
tiations for acquiring public utilities, "Pro
vided, further, that all estimates of the cost
and value of such works snail be first made
and recommended to be reasonable by the
Board of Public Works before submission to
the citizens."
Turning to the restrictions put upon the
Board of Public Works we find the new charter
provides (article 6, chapter 1, section 3): "Xo
order or resolution shall be passed or business
transacted involving the approval of bonds,
awarding of contracts, appointment of em
ployes, or resolutions of intention recommend
ing work or improvement, except by the con
current vote of all said Commissioners" (the
Board of Public Works).
The case is plain and it is true, as we have
contended, that one member of the Board of
Public Works who would be controlled by or
favorable to the monopolists could insist upon
such estimates as would please them, and thus
defeat any movement for public ownership.
This is clearly illustrated if we will suppose
that all the Board of Railroad Commissioners
were required to approve every measure or ac
tion before it would'be of legal effect. Could
not the Southern Pacific then block a reduc
tion of rates if they controlled one member?
We are told that the new charter says the
Board of Public WorKs must regularly make
tne estimates. That is true; but it nicely ad
justs matters so that the estimates will hi fav
orable to the "associated villainies' 1 if they
can control or influence one member of the
board.
The advocate says that he is "a firm believer
in municipal ownersnip." His belief is better
than nis perception and knowledge ot the
wiles of monopolists. Quoting his own words
and applying them to the new charter I con
clude that so involved is the new charter and
the limitations placed upon liberal construc
tions will be so many and awkward that it
will be an open question among jurists
whether or no San Francisco could ever secure
public ownership of anything.
John M. Reynolds.
NO PSALM-TUNES THEN.
David's Songs Wedded to the Ballad
Airs of the French Conrt.
It is a curious circumstance that both In
France and in England the necessityâ or,
let us say the expediency â of making the
psalmist "run in rhyme" was first recog
nized by men connected with the court. It
occasioned no little surprise when Clement
Marot, "valet of the bedchamber" to Fran
cis I, put forward his musical psalms as
substitutes for the love songs of the French
grandees. And yet, the surprise notwith
standing, these "sanctes chansonnettes"
of Marot leaped into fashion, and a first
edition of 10,000 was disposed of before the
poet had well realized that he had become
famous.
There were no psalm tunfcs in those
days, and so the Princes, the King's mis
tresses, tne lords and ladies of the court
adapted whatever lay ready to hand, and
unhesitatingly wedded the "sweet singer
of Israel" to the ballad tunes of the times.
More than that, the fashionables had each
a favorite psalm of his or her own. Thus
the Dauphin, as became a lover of the
chase, selected "As the hart panteth after
the water brooks": while the Queen, with
equal appropriateness, chose "Kebuke me
not in thine indignation." Diana of Poic
tiers would one day be heard singing,
"From the depths of my heart"; the next
day King Anthony of Navarre would be
chanting. "Stand up, O Lord, to revenge
my quarrel !"
A strange picture this, of a dissolute
court singing the Psalms of David, from
exquisite little duodecimos in morocco
gilt, to the jig tunes of the day. A strange
but not a unique picture, for even the staid
Scottish PresWterians of early Reforma
tion times had done something of the
same kind, and had anticipated the Salva
tion Army of to-day by transforming tne
tunes of "John Anderson, My Jo, and
other "godless aires" to suit the psalms
with which their thoughtful leaders had
provided them. The "Psalms of Dundee,"
produced while Knox was preparing to
thunder out his anathemas against the
priests, were incongruous enough in all
conscience in their strange medley of cant
ing absurdity and nonsense. It is not easy
for us in these days to understand how
such "gude godlie ballates, changed out of
profane songs," could be supposed to serve
as corrections of "sinne and harlotrie. " In
reading them, "to laugh were want of
godliness and grace," and yet to be grave
"exceeds all power of face." Generally
speaking the "godlie" part is as limited
as we find it in the following specimen
taken at random :
With huntis up, with huntis up,
It is now pertlte day;
Jesus of king is gone a-huntin?,
Qutaa likes to speed they may.

MARRIED IN GREAT HASTE
A San Francisco Couple Go to
Oakland to Have the
Knot Tied.
THEY CAUGHT THE LAST TRAIN
The Judge Was at Dinner, but He
Went Down and Slipped On
the Ring.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 16.â Peter
Eisenmann and Lena Edelmann came
from San Francisco to-night for the pur-
Dose of getting married. They arrived
after the County Clerk's office had closed,
but a friendly janitor began working tele
phones, and in the course of a few minutes
a license was procured.
Judge Clift was told there was a chance
to make two people happy. He was at his
dinner at the Metropole, but a trifle like
an unfinished dinner does not bother him
ia times when votes are as hard to get as
at present, so he hurriedly went to hia
office.
Mr. Eisenmann and his sister and the
bride-elect were waiting for him and they
told the Judge they were in a hurry and
wanted to go back on the next train. Up
the stairs flew the bridal party and into
the dark office which was dimly lighted
by an electric light on Broadway. The
bridegroom wanted the ceremony per
formed forthwith; the dim light would
suffice to hide his blushes. But Judge
Clift could not read the statute in the
dark, so he ruled in favor of lighting the
gas. In the meantime the train could be
heard approaching from Oak street with,
the bell ringing loudly. The groom got
nervous and asked the Judge to be
speedy, remarking that the lady was sick.
He complied and read with all his might.
The clanging bell came nearer and the un
rest of the bridal party increased.
"The ring, the ring," said the Judge.
The groom iumbled in his pocket and the
young lady reminded him that he had
already placed it on her finger before the
ceremony began. The Judge continued
reading and beat the train. Just after
repeating the "I promise" paragraph the
train stopped at Broadway, and tne hissing
air that was released from the brakes of
the train was hardly sufficient to drown
the sound of the kiss that was imprinted
on the young wife's cheek by her husband.
"Pretty good time," said Judge Clift as
he wiped his brow. "Only seven minutes
and a half since I left my soup." By this
time the newly wedded couple were at the
train, which was just starting.
The bride got on the platform first, and
the horrid gateman was just slamming the
gate when a little shriek behind caused
him to pause. He had nearly taken the
wife to the City and left the husband of
two minutes in Oakland.
Who Are Gentlemen?
Discussing abroad the features of re
spective armies with a foreign officer, who
owed in some measure his confidential
hilarity to the effects of champagne, I in
quired: "Are those who hold the grade
of regarded as 'gentlemen' in your
service?" "Sir," he answered loftily,
"every officer holding his Majesty's com
missionâ" "Yes. yea," I interrupted, "in
theory of course; but tell me, confiden
tially, is this the case in practice?" His
high mightiness thereupon indulged
in such an amount of what Cap
tain Marryat's Peter Simple calls grandil
oquent flapdoodle â and which O'Brien
[ defines as the Btuff on which they feed
I fools â that I hastily ate up my words in
dread of the local "Court of Honor" to
which my observation might be referred.
After all, foreigners have no equivalent for
our term "gentleman," which need not be
merged in that of "officer," inasmuch as,
coeteris paribus, the higher the gentleman
the better the officer. "I wish, sir," said
an ex-sergeant-major to me, "that officers
more fully realized the influence by daily
life example which they exercise over their
men. Their dispositiou, their habits,
their conversation are constant topics im
ported into the barrack-room by sergeants,
servants and mess waiters. Their most
secret transactions, creditable or other
wise, leak out with an accuracy of detail
which you little suspect." â Biackwood's

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
The shamrock blooms to-day.
Here's good lack to all who celebrate.
St. Patrick's day in the morning, and
everybody says, "God bless old Ireland."
Unpledged delegates is one point in poli
tics on which the whole of the greater
West agtees.
The Fair will seems to have been con
structed on the principle of a progressive
surprise party.
It is now evident the Junta was not
strutting in borrowed plumage. The bird
is a real peacock.
England's latest game in Egypt is kept
too dark to be well understood, but it
smells like brimstone.
The latest wood-sawing done by the
Italians in Abyssinia Was to saw off the
campaign, and it was a good job.
The Cubans will never believe we are
willing to lend them a hand unless we ro
the whole way and offer them arms.
If European diplomacy is doing any
thing more in these days than raising cain
the world wouid like to know what it is.
it is getting about time now for Cleve
land to break loose in another place and a
message of some sort may be expected any
day.
By this time the Armenians must have
reached the conclusion that they are the
only Christians on earth and haven't long
to stay.
Now that the Junta has Buckley in a
sling let us hope it will succeed in throw
ing him so far out of politics he can never
crawl back.
It is clear that King Menelek has an eye
on the British expedition up the Nile, and
he may yet join hands with the dervishes
and help them take it in.
Owing to the complications of his ally,
King Humbert, the Kaiser ha 3 decided
that his elaborately constructed bluff
against England shall be caved down the
bank.
Although the British expedition up the
Nile is reported to be undertaken at the
expense of Egypt it may turn out to be at
the cost of the English in Egypt before it
is over.
It is now time for Hud yard Kipling to
indite a ballad to Gavin McNab. He is a
pretty good Fuzzy Wuzzy and a first-class
righting man, for he broke a Buckley
square.
If Allison has working for him many
such men as Clarkson, he will not be
second choice at St. Louis for more than
one balloi nor second with the people on
any ballot.
McNab did not get far from the meeting
place of the Democratic State Committee
before he learned tbat the Buckley crowd

WESTERN INTERESTS.
In an interview published in The Call
yesterday. General J. S. Clarkson gave ad
i vice to the Republicans of California
which will go far to confirm them in the
already generally approved policy of send
ing unpledged delegates to the National
Convention at St. Louis. This plan has
been heretofore advised by The Call and
by other papers in the State, but none the
less do the words of so experienced a party
leader as General Clarkson deserve at
tentive consideration.
The General's argument on the subject is
based upon the proposition tbat a National
Convention is a National conference. "The
Republicans from the certain States," said
he, "and the Republicans from the hope
less Democratic States should confer with
Republicans from the doubtful but neces
sary States before deciding who will be the
strongest candidate and command the
votes necessary to win." Passing from the
general view of the subject to a considera
tion of Pacific Coast interests particularly
he said: "California, a great and splendid
State, the empire State of the coast, can
group about it the smaller States and Ter
ritories and go into the St. Louis conven
tion with a power as great as that wielded
by any other great section of the country
if it shall act for its own interests and for
the interests of the whole party. Califor
nia has been too generous with its power
heretofore. It has generally committed
itself to some one and gone down with
him, or made no terms if it succeeded."
That the Western States and Territories
have great interests peculiar to themselves
that should be carefully looked after by
their statesmen is beyond question. As
General Clarkson said: "The General
Government is more necessary to the new
or Western States than to the Eastern.
The older States are largely finished com
munities and the General Government has
little to do with them. In all the Western
States, with their resources undeveloped
and their public works uncompleted, with
their destiny as yet merely hinted at, the
General Government is more necessary."
The facts thus stated are beyond gain
saying, and the more they are considered
the more weighty will they appear to all
who are earnestly interested in the ad
vancement of this section of the Union.
From the sentiment which at this time
prevails in the Republican party it is
not likely that any serious attempt will be
made by the State Convention to send a
pledged and bound delegation to St. Louis.
Nevertheless when people are not resolved
upon a definite course it is sometimes pos
sible to stampede them into another. For
that reason it is just as well to have the
subject of pledges settled before the State
Convention meets. Let it be determined,
therefore, in every county and every dis
trict that the California delegation goes
East this time pledged only to the Repub
lican party, the interests of the West and
the welfare of the Union.
A NOVEL PROPOSITION.
Henry E. Highton, assisting the Dis
trict Attorney in an action brought by
the State to oust the Street Superin
tendent from office on account of his
alleged untitness for the position, has
embodied a radical proposition in his
brief. It is tbat a public officer has
definitive duties to discharge under the
law, and that he and his bondsmen are
pledged for his competency and fidelity in
their discharge; if he proves incompetent
or unfaithful be has broken his agreement
with the public and forfeited his right to
remain in office. It will be curious to ob
serve how this proposition will be regarded
by the courts.
It is sufficiently novel to invite analysis.
The theory of civil service is that in those
branches of the public service which re
quire special aptitudes of a clerical sort the
consideration of business adaptability is
paramount to that of reward for party
service. In France this is carried to its
extreme logical conclusion. Ministries
may be overthrown aad yet the vast army
of serious and busy workers who conduct
the routine affairs of the Government re
main secure in their positions, being
largely independent of the. influence and
power which even the strongest members
of the Ministry might wish to exercise.
To that extent the business of the Govern
ment is conducted much like that of a
great private corporation, which, what iver
the mutations in its board of directors, is
likely to retain its best servants and sure
to employ none but those competent for
the positions given them.
This naturally reduces the working
strength of political parties. It brings its
evils as well as its benefits. While the
civil service advocates of this country have
hanging over them a vague threat of dis
missal if they resort to "offensive parti
sanship," yet n othing is more notorious
than the ''Federal ring" here and there,
working secretly and ably. Its working
has given to the Cleveland administration
a fictitious strength utterly out of propor
tion to the popular estimate of the party's
worth or the soundness oj its principles.
It has been largely by the exercise of this
power that the evils of a bad financial pol
icy and a ruinous tariff have become
fastened upon the country.
It would be extremely difficult to apply
the civil service idea to an office like that
of Street Superintendent in a large city.
Technical knowledge is not nearly so im
portant in such a case as directing ability
and personal integrity. The great ques
tion arises as to whether the voters or the
courts are the better tribunal for determin
ing the worth of its public servants. To
place such a power in the hands of the
courts would be to take it away from the
people and abolish tne full privilege of the
franchise. This might lead to worse abuses
than those arising from an unintelligent
or heedless exercise of the voting power.
All these considerations invest Mr. High
ton's proposition with a lively interest, and
it will be instructive to watch the manner
of its reception.
THE SUNDAY EXCURSION.
It seems early for the opening of the
picnic season, and yet the report comes
from Mill Valley that an excursion of San
Francisco roughs overran the place on Sun
day, that there was a great deal of drunk
enness, fighting and vandalism, and that
the policeman sent with the party from
Francisco, aided by an extra force of the
local constabulary, had work to maintain
a semblance of the peace. A few years
ago there was so strenuous an. outcry
against these Sunday excursions that steps
were taken to curtail their evils, but they
still remain an annually recurring dis
grace. The pleasure of a summer resi
dence in many of the delightful spots in
the country contiguous to San Francisco
is robbed of some of its delights.
Reference is made here to those unor
ganized excursions which spring from the
offer of the railroads of exceptionally low
Sunday rates to all who wish to take the
outing. Excursions made by organized
bodies commonly have special trains, and
they are carefully guarded against the in
trusion of the rowdy element. An addi
tional precaution is taken in -the shape of
a committee charged with maintaining
order. There is no general objection to
Sunday excursions made under such cir
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH IT, 1896.
cumstances, particularly as they give a
pleasant and wholesome outing to large
numbers of persons who cannot spare the
time on other days.
The unorganized excursions are quite
another matter. There is no responsibility
in their management. Their evil lies- not
alone in the fact that they offer special in
ducements to roughs ; a worse feature of
them is their demoralizing effect on the
ordinarily well-behaved young men and
women who, through ignorance or heed
lessness, take advantage of the opportunity
to have a day's outing at a small cost.
The effect upon these is demoralizing in a
double sense â both by reason of the asso
ciation and the knowledge that they are
unrestrained by the presence of those who
know them. Such Sunday excursions as
these are far more injurious than the good
people of this City imagine.
The sole responsibility for them rests
upon the railroad companies. For the
preservation of the peace the Police De
partment of San Francisco has to send on
such excursions a strong body of police
men, who are maintained at the expense
of the City and who are compelled onjuEtly
to perform exceedingly onerous and dan
gerous duties outside their jurisdiction.
By sending these officers the City govern
ment condones the evil which the necessity
for their presence represents. A consider
able part of the duties of these officers is
the protection of the railroad companies'
property from injury. All tbis is absurdly
wrong and the practice positively imraorai.
If the railroad companies cannot be made
amenable to considerations of common
decency it might be well to try the efficacy
of laws aimed to hold them within decor
ous bounds.
A PALPABLE IRAUD.
London must have a number of delicious
ly confiding residents if such a fraud as
that reported from Santa Ana, in this
State, can prosper. The story is that a
young Englishman named If. S. Meggitt,
reading in a London paper an announce
ment that the advertiser would secure sit
uations on fruit farms in Southern Cali
fornia for applicants, procured $50 from
his mother and paid it to the fellow, the
understanding being that Mr. Meggitt
should work in the orchard of T. P.
Thompson at Alhambra for a year for his
board and meanwhile learn the business of
growing fruit. After paying the $50 and
his expenses in reaching California Mr.
Megeitt learned that there was no such
grower as Thompson and that he had been
swindled.
So long as people can be found thus
ready to be swindled there is no prevent
ing such frauds as this. There are thou
sands of Englishmen in California and an
English Consul in San Francisco, and a
note of inquiry would have informed Mr.
Meggitt that the proposition was a fraud.
Even that precaution was unnecessary, as
ordinary common-sense should have in
formed him that in a new country a man
who wants to learn the business special to
it can generally secure employment at a
salary and without having to pay for the
privilege.
This calls up an unfortunate phase in
the development of California. Several
years ago a large number of young Eng
lishmen came to the State on representa
tions made by agents of interested parties
and settled on lands which they had never
taken intelligent pains to study. Many
lost what money they brought and re
turned to England with a poor opinion of
the State. On the other hand, organized
bodies of English immigrants have estab
lished in various parts of the State some
of the most thriving colonies that we have
and they are contented. The spirit of ad
venture is exceedingly strong in the Eng
lish race and its young men particularly
are to be found in large numbers in all
new countries. With this admirable de
sire to improve their condition and a
manly cheerfulness in accepting all its
possible hardships there is too likely to be
a disposition to ignore the necessity for
ordinary caution. Perhaps it is all a mani
festation of the English instinct of over
weening self-confidence. By reason of this
fact young Englishmen have suffered more
than any other foreigners in California.
The Teutonic races proceed very differ
ently. They first make absolutely sure of
their ground, and in that pnrsuit bring the
hardest kind of common-sense into play.
As a result they are the most prosperous
of all the people in California. It would
be advisable for the English in California
to have some kind of association for keep
ing their confiding kindred at home out of
danger and be ready to furnish all informa
tion required. If this business were prop
erly handled and received the generous co
operation of Americans, California might
have a very desirable and numerous immi
gration from England.
COAST EXCHANGES.
Placerville is stirred by the awakened
spirit of energy that is in evidence in many
parts of California, and is roused to an
understanding of the fact that its superb
resources can be made known only through
the intelligent work and co-operation of its
citizens. The Placerville Nugget publishes
an inspiring account of the League of Prog
ress, which has been formed there re
cently by the public- spin ted residents for
the advancement of Placerville's interests.
The movement should serve as an example
to every other community in the State.
That the Nugget fully partakes of the
spirit which is abroad in Placerville is
shown by the urgency with which it is
supporting the League of. Progress and ad
vocating the setting apart of a day for the
planting of shade trees.
Away op at Fort Jones the progressive
movement is already well under way. The
County Reporter notes the fact that not long
ago a committee of citizens was appointed
to establish water works and an electric
light plant. "The outcome/ 1 says our
contemporary, "is that water rights have
been secured, together with other valuable
property and building lots in center of
town. A company has been organized,
which in aue time will be incorporated,
and is to be known as the Etna Develop
ment Company." The company will fur
nish water snd deliver lights at a reason
able cost. The Reporter adds that the
company proposes to encourage any enter
prise that may offer itself, and adds:
"Taking into consideration the fact that
Etna is one of the best centers north of
Redding, what may we not expect of a
town in the heart of a fine farming coun
try on the one hand and the home of pro
gressive and [enterprising citizens on the
other, backed up from behind by inex
haustible gold fields and great manufac
turing possibilities."
The San Jose Mercury, after compla
cently acknowledging the compliments
that have been received from all parts of
the State on the excellent roads which
center in the city, makes this generous
acknowledgment: "We must disclaim the
credit given us for the roads which have
made Santa Clara County famous through
out the length and breadth of the State."
In one respect, at least, remarks the Los
Angeles Times, the San Jose people have
set a good example, which Los Angeles
might with advantage imitate. There is
no city in the State with better roads than
i those leading from San Jose. They are
carefully watered on a systematic plan,
and driving along these boulevards is a
pleasure at any time of the year. In short,
while Lob Angeles has been talking about
boulevards, San Jose has been using them
for many years. These splendid public
thoroughfares exist, but they are the re
sult exclusively of the good judgment,
business foresight and public spirit of the
successive Boards of Supervisors of this
county, and not due to San Jose enterprise.
This means to say every Board of Super
visors in California might emulate the ex
ample of the Santa Clara board.
The Mercury gives a further insight into
the good roads question in the following
paragraph: "If the project of the Super
visors to procure water for the purpose of
sprinkling the county road from Gilroy
south to the Pajaro River is carried out
one may then travel through the entire
length of the county, from San Francis
quito Greek to the southern line, a distance
of nearly sixty miles, over a sprinkled road.
The main lateral roads are also sprinkled
throughout the summer, and this magnifi
cent system has been perfected at a small
expense to the taxpayers, when the im
mense saving to the roads and to the haul
ers of produce is considered. No county
in the State has anything like it."
Los Gatos has its Women's Club, which
has not only effected the cleaning of the
streets, but has begun a scheme of tree
planting that will add greatly to the charm
of the town, and now comes this announce
men by the News: "F. G. Hume, contrac
tor for lighting the streets with electricity,
is pushing preparations to have the plant
in at an early date. The move of the Board
of Trustees has met with hearty approval,
and there is every indication that the new
system of lighting will be all tbat is ex
pected of it."
The following from the San Dieeo Union
gives an idea of the hopes and aims of the
southern end of the State: "Escondido
people are talking of starting a creamery.
They also propose to bore for oil, and min
ing men are looking over the field there
with a view to putting up a tifty-stamp
mill. It would be a great gain for the
town if any one of these undertakings
should be carried out successfully. The
faster creameries are established in South
ern California the quicker a great drain of
money to the north and east will be
stopped. To bore for oil is always rather a
speculative proposition, but petroleum is a
bonanza that is worth hunting for wher
ever there are indications of it. The pro
posed Rtampmili would wonderfully pro
mote the mining industry, and ought to
prove profitable to its owners."
The Oakdale Leader exhibits a com
mandable spirit cf exultation in making
the announcement that the Stanislaus
Milling and Power Company has received
so much encouragement from the progres
sive residents of Oakdale as to have de
cided to install an electric-light plant
there, with power for motors. This im
provement will serve a useful end in
attracting the outside attention which the
splendid resources of Oakdale so emi
nently deserve.
A curious illustration of the diversity of
California's climate is shown in the fol
lowing accidental arrangement of two
paragraphs which recently appeared in
one of our interior exchanges:
"Twenty-six inches of snow fell at Te
bachapi during the late storm."
â¢'Green peas are being shipped from
Orange County to Denver and Chicago."
The Coast Advocate, published at Half
moon Bay. gives this interesting news:
"Mr. McGlew, who is interested in the
California Oil Company, believes the pros
pect for a strike on the Bank ranch is a
good one. Judged by the order of the
strata passed through the company is on
the right track. The presence of oil is cer
tain: the only question is quantity. An
other delay in the work has occurred.
The well will be lined and the men were
laid off Saturday until the casing could be
obtained from the City and put into
place."

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Among the arrivals at the Grand, after an
absence from California of over a year, is D.
Bernard, well known as a railroad builder and
interested in other projects. Mr. Bernard has
been way down in Jamaica.
He had a contract there on a railroad run
ning fifty miles in the interior from Kingston,
the capital of Jamaica. The work is well on
toward completion now and Mr. Bernard has
left the finishing of it in the hands of his
partner and came on to California. Mr. Ber
nard's last contract here was on the Southern
Pacific in San Luis Obispo County.
"Of course an American doesn't care to live
in a country like Jamaica," he said, "unless he
is making money. As I was practically through
with my work I had nothing more to remain
for.
"Jamaica is reasonably prosperous, but she
has gone out of the sugar and tobacco business
considerably and gone to raising fruit. There

is a big Boston company that has become
largely interested in the fruit industry there
and ships very extensively to Boston, New York
and other American cities. Steamers run
down there regularly from Baltimore and
other places on the Atlantic Coast and pretty
quick connection is made, so that a man there
is not really so far out of the world as might be
supposed. I got a paper about once a week
which kept me reasonably well informed.
"So far as railroads are concerned in Jamaica,
I don't suppose there are over 300 miles of
road in the whole country. It is not very well
supplied in this way. Yes, it is pretty hot
there. Altogether I was glad to get to this
country again."
Mr. Bernard, though an old Californian, has
lived for a part of the time in recent years at
Denver.
Mr. Bernard, in finishing the connecting
link of fifty miles in the chain of railroads
encircling the Island of Jamaica, has per
formed a great feat. The road runs entirely
throughÂ»mouutains and morass. It has 27
tunnels, 193 girder bridges, 13 viaducts and
11 tower bridges. It is said that no such
tremendous obstacles were ever met by engi
neers in a fifty-mile stretch. The cost will
average more than $100,000 a mile.
Dr. Heinrich Kanner, the editor of the Ger
man weekly, Der Heit, mnl correspondent of
the powerful German daily, the Frankfurter
Zeitung, has gone to Los Angeles for a short
visit, and will then proceed to New York and
other Eastern cities.
During the past six months he has been in
Japan and China, being occupied with a special
study of the Eastern question. Mr. Kanner
hat a high opinion of the diplomatic ability of
Russia, and thinks that country leads the
world in diplomacy.
"As illustrative of this," he said, just before
leaving, "you have only to note what she has
lately accomplished, and that without lifting
a hand. She got the Liao Tung Peninsula and
control of Korea, the latter the very thing
Japan was fighting for.
'â¢Japan's people are good fighters, but they
are not diplomats. That was shown in the
recent war, but they never thought that after
fighting and winning a victory they would
lose the fruits of it in this way. Russia, with
out doing anything but look on, continued to
get the benefits of the struggle, and that iv
such a way that Japan was perplexed to know
how it was done. It was a singular victory
and shows the power of a country which is so
adept in diplomacy as Russia.
"In regard to the Frankfurter Zeitung,
though its circulation is no more than 40,000.
the secret of its influence is that it circulates
among the higher classes, and is so careful in
whaUt says that it is believed like the Bible.
The paper is influential and the people it
reaches are also influential. It pays great at
tention to accurate political and commercial
news, and, while it is found all over Germany,
its power is especially felt along the Maine.
"But to reach both classes the proprietors of
the Zeitung have another paper for the poorer
people which is sold very cheap and furnishes
the kind of matter they like. The paper has a
name which would mean bulletin here. The
Frankfurter Zeitung is published three times
a day, with a fourth edition at 2 a. m. for cer
tain early trains and boats."
Dr. Kanner is a young looking man of ap
parently 35 years. He wears a full brown

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Arrival of the United States
Gunboat Bennington From
Honolulu.
POET ENGINE BROKE DOWN.
Two Sealing Schooners Lost in Alaskan
Waters, One With All
Hands.
The United States gunboat Bennington
arrived from Honolulu yesterday, after a
very lengthy passage of eleven days. Her
officers are as follows: Commander,
George W. Digman; lieutenantsâ A. B.
Speyers, W. P. Elliott, H. T. Mayo, A. G.
Winterhalter, C. P. Eaton, Ensign Victor
Blue and C. D. Steams; surgeon, C. T.
Hibbett; chief engineer, H. K. Barton;
passed assistant engineer, W. H. Allder
dice; passed assistant paymaster, J. S.
Phillips; pay clerk. D. M. Addison.
The Bennington sailed from Honolulu
at 10 a. m. on the sth inst. and the Ocean c
The United States Gunboat Bennington as She Appeared When Off Sau?alito Yesterday. Her Run
From Honolulu Was a Long One Owing to a Breakdown in the Port Engine.
[Sketched by a "Call * artist.}
Steamship Company's Alamoda left five
hours later. The Bennington has twenty
three of the crew of the wrecked sealing
schooner Mattie T. Dyer aboard, and the
men thought they would at least reach
San Francisco as quickly as the mailboat.
They were disappointed, however. Five
days out the port engine broke down, and
during the right the air pump struck
work. For three . hours the nian-oi-war
was at the mercy of the wind and waves,
but the engineers were equal to the occa
sion, and it was not long before she was
again plowing her way toward San Pran
c isco.
The long stay in southern waters ha? not
improved the Bennington's null, and in
consequence she will have to go on the dry
dock at Mare Island. She will steam up
there this morning and will be put out of
commission during the day. Tiie officers
say that her long trip was due more to tier
foul bottom than to any accident to the
inachmery. A heavy head sea was en
countered during the run, but the gunboat
rode through it without trouble, and proved
herself to be a thorough seaboat.
The Bennington has been unfortunate
almost ever since she wa3 launched. Time
and again her machinery has broken down,
and when she was on the Asiatic station
she was the laughing stock of the navies of
the world. The chances are that it will be
many a month before she goes into com :
mission again.
Two more sealing schooners are added
to the list of lost and missing. The Wan
derer, owned by tbe Victoria Sealing and
Trading Company, went ashore in St.
Josephs Bay and all hands were saved by
the revenue cutter Corwin. She became a
total wreck. The May Belle left Victoria,
B. C, early in January for Ucluelete in
Alaska to pick up an Indian crew. There
were seven white men aboard and neither
vessel nor crew has been heard from since.
The May Belle was in the heavy gales of
January 26 and 27 and a private letter
received in this City yesterday it stated
that her owners have given her up as lost.
Ross & Hewlett have the sealing schoon
ers Lilly L and Emma and Louisa lying at
anchor in Sausalito Bay. They do not
know whether to sell them or fit them out
for another cruise. The temptation to sell
is very great, as at least a dozen men are
after the vessels to fit them out fora voyage
to Cooks Inlet. Both schooners have
accommodations for over ihirty men, and
it would be no trouble to lit up bunks for
twenty more. Now that the Alaskan min
ing crate is on the would-be purchasers
think they would have no trouble in get
ting enough miners who are anxious to
reach the new El Dorado to rill the passen
ger list. The owners are not at all anxious
to sell, however, and the chances are that
Captain Charley Mqckler may yet go out
on a sealing cruise in the Lilly L. ,
The Harbor Commissioners are getting
worried over the delay in starting work on
the new ferry depot. The Supreme Court
is taking its own time in rendering a de
cision in the Batemnn Brothers' case, and
in the mean time the State is paying $24,000
a year interest on its bonds, and the con
tractors are out and injured. All of them
have bonds up to do the work within a
specified time, and they are making the
lives of Messrs. Colnon, Cole and Chad
bourne miserable by their importuning.
Some action in the matter will be taken at
the meeting of the board to be held to-day.
SEIZED FOUR COWS.
Milk Inspector Dockery Makes a Haul
of Boviues on thÂ« San Bruno
Marshes.
Between Milk Inspector Dockery and the
Poundmaster the milk ranchers who per
mit their cows to roam and feed in the
slime and mud of the San Bruno marshes
are having a hard time of it. They have
been warned repeatedly to keep their cows
off the marsh, and now the officials have
begun to make seizures of any uncleanly
animals they find.
Inspector Dockery had a lively chase for
a few hours yesterday, that resulted in
four cows, belonging to P. McDermott,
being landed inthe Pound.
The health officials saw the bovines
wandering about the marsh and set all .sail
in pursuit. After much trouble he herded
them into a corral and went to the nearest
telephone to notify the Poundinaster that
his services were needed. While his
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 17, 1896.
watchful eye was not on the cows the
owner released them from the pen where
they had been placed and drove them to
his ranch. Here they were found by the
two officials and confiscated.
McDcrmott will be arrested to-day under
the section of the new milk ordinance that
makes it a misdemeanor to sell milk taken
from uncleanly cows.
Inspector Dockery announced yesterday
that he would soon begin making arrests
of those who have not procured permits to
sell milk as provided by the ordinance.
Though many milkmen, restaurant and
hotel-keepers have complied with the law
there are yet several liundred who have
not, and these will be given but a very
short time to appear at the office of the
Board of Health and iiJe their applications
for permits.
SCARED THE CHILDREN.
How a Youth of the T.at in Quarter Pro-
cured for Himself a Sound
Beating.
The manner in which one small boy
threw the Latin quarter into a ferment and
gave rise to a rumor that masked robbers
were operating in that section of the City
was told in Justice Groezinger's court yes
terday, in the case of G. Garcii against Fe
lice Feregoni. Paul Gardi, a son of the
plaintiff, put on a mask and girls' clothing
on February 4, in anticipation of the com
ing Mardi Gras, and called on a number
of families. At the house of the defendant
the children screamed at the masked boy,
who earned a section of that re
sembled a knife in his hand.
The defendant, according to his story
on the stand, rushed out ani saw what he
thought was a knife in the masker's hand,
and after exclaiming "There I am dead,"
proceeded to belabor the boy until he had
caused injuries that cost $17 in plasters
and'tloctor's care to repair.
The boy's father wanted him to pay the

BIG IRRIGATING SCHEME
Frank Adams to Construct a
Canal in Shasta and
Tehama.
It Will Be Forty Miles Long and
Water a Vast and Rich
Area.
Frank Adams of 1911 McAllister street
is at the head of a scheme looking to the
irrigation of thousands of acres of land in
Shasta and Tehama counties, adjacent to
the great waterway of the central and
northern part of the State, the Sacramento
River.
The proposition is to take water from the
river at some point near Cottonwood,
Shasta County, and, by means of a
canal thirty-five or forty miles in length,
distribute it over an area of several thou
sand square acres.
Mr. Adams is not a capitalist himself
and owns but a few hundred acres in the
district intended to be incorporated with
in the irrigating limits.
C. 8. Capp of C. S. Capp & Co., real
estate brokers. 415 Montgomery street'
who owns several hundred acres near the
land of Mr. Adams, but over the line in
Tehama County, said yesterday: "The
construction of such a canal as that pre-
Eosed by Mr. Adams would prove a great
oon to'that part of the State. As every
ene who has any knowledge of the
topography and climatic conditions of
that part of the State knows full well
thousands of dollars are lost every year
for lack of water. As in the San Joaquin
there is only about one good crop out of
every four.
'I am not speaking from the view point
of an interested person as my land is out
sind the boundaries of tne area to be bene
fited by the proposed irrigating c:mal.
To be sure I would be benefited indirectly
by the ennancing of the land values natur
ally to follow on the heels cf an enterprise
of the kind. Therefore I can speak with
out prejudice or predisposition of the prac
ticability of the jcheme. Mr. Adams'
plan is good. He does not expect to get
rich from the enterprise. There is not
enough land in his possession to warant
such an inference.
"He proposes that during the dull sea
son of the year the landowners of the dis
trict to be'benefited by the canal furnish
bo many men and teams to excavate a
given number of miles of the cannl, and to
receive in remuneration scrip, which shall
be taken in payment for water furnished
when the ca/ial is built. The surveys have
been made and engineers' estimates bear
out ray assertion that the scheme is practi
cable and will be worth hundreds of thou
sands of dollars to that part of Shasta and
Tehama counties.
"Tire carrying out of the project has a
very important bearing on the question
of relieving the overflow of the rivÂ«r dur
ing freshets, and that has led many to con
found it with the .scheme promulgated by
Will S. Green of the Colusa Sun, now
United States Surveyor-General/ of con
structing a canal from Redding to Suisun
Bay. to carry off the surplus water in the
spring and ?ave the levees. It also was
proposed to construct the canal in such a
way as to make it navigable and save
much time to Hat-bottomed river craft.
But more of that anon. The present canal
scheme is paramount in landowners' in
terest and means much to that part of the
State."
ALL ABOUT THE NEW MAN
The Rev. Anna Shaw Tells How
the New Woman's Mate
Should Be.
HIS PRESENT SAD LACKINGS.
Native Sons' Hall Crowded With Ad
mirers of the Famous Woman
Suffragists.
H Nearly every seat in the Native Sons'
Hall was filled last night with the crowd
that came to hear Miss Anna Shaw on her
return to California. Her audience was
composed almost entirely of her own sex,
there being only a sprinkling of gentlemen
present, and these came more from the
necessity of acting as escorts to the newer
woman, perhaps, than from desire to
listen to the reverend lady's lecture on
"The New Man."
Besides Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, who in
troduced the speaker, there were seated on
the platform Mrs. Ellen C. Sargent, widow
of Senator A. A. Sargent; Mrs. John F.
Swift, president of the Century Club, and
Miss Susan B. Anthony. Mrs. Cooper in
troduced the lecturer, who spoke, substan
tially, as follows:
I need say nothing about the new woman .
We know all about her. The paragrapher has
told us all about Her. She has been thoroughly
dissected ever since she first came. We did
not know that we wanted her and now we
know that we could not live without her. We
are glad she is here and we hope she will settle
down and leave us in peace. She resembles
the old woman in one thing. She never in
tends to go it alone. But she needs a new man.
We only rind her to be an old woman with a
few modern improvements. We have come to
the conclusion thet the new woman will be
among other things a new mother-in-law, but
to be a mother-in-law there must be a soii-in
law. and she is looking for him.
We are no longer disturbed to know whether
â¦he new woman will dress like her father or
her mother, or whether she will dress partly
like both. Miss Anthony says shs has had
more letters regarding the dress of women,
and particularly with reference to bloomers,
than with reference to any other subject. The
fear seems to be that the new woman will re
sort entirely to bloomers. Hut they need have
no fear of that. A woman will always try to
look her very best, and no human being can
look well in men's clothes. Consequently we
will leave you your clothes.
The bloomer woman came; she remained a
short time and then she disappeared, because
bloomers are contrary to nature. In fact, any
kind of garment is contrary. to nature; 'but if
there is anything under, the light of the Run
that nature ever approached it Is a dress
coat.
How will the new man look? - How will he
walk and how will he dress? Will he dress like
his father or like his mother? Will his ulster
trail on the ground? Will his hair be parted
in the middle ? How will he manage himself
anyhow? 'We don't know, but â ; this we do
know: : He will have an easier time than the
new woman has bad, because he will not be
made as ridiculous by the new woman as she
was by the old man. ' . ' .;â  ; _ : .
And in the meantime there will no doubt be
a great many sissy men, and if there is any
thing worse than a masculine woman it is a
sissy man.
The new woman has the same right to criti
cize the new man that the present man exer-'
cises in criticizing the new woman. She has
got to tell the ! new man what : kind of a man
she is going to marry, because she has always
been ' toid what kind of a woman he is going
to marry.: â  â¢ ...
The one thought that first impresses us is the
large size of the men V and . the: handsome
woznen which you have. Your men have, ob
tained to the stature of gladiators. In the
East they are smaller and are growing smaller.'
During the <last twenty-rive years the : stature
of women has been increasing and that of men
has been de creasing. :- So i that unless some
thing transpires to chance this the new woman
will find it impossible to do what it has always
been told them it was their: duty to doâ look
up to the new man. - : â Â» . .:â¢ "â â ./-, â . .-.
, i When we make !an - investigation as to the
cause of this we find that so far as the women
are concerned itis due to the conditions that
make it essential for women to take exercise.
The day has gone by when a woman can say that
she is vulgarly healthy. .When I was in college
it was said that women could not bear the
physical.; strain necessary â . in college. ,> Now. I
have known something of women in college,

study herself to death. â It was real ly , v nder

man would not consider woman as a
competitor, but would seek always to co
operate with her and thus accomplish
the most good for the race. "Men and
women will then be friends and it will not
be necessary for them to marry because

AT THE CITY THEATERS
"Captain Impudence" Makes Quite
a Hit at the Cali
fornia.
"A Texas Steer" Comes to the Colum
biaâContinuous Show at
the Alcazar.
It is some time since San Francisco has
seen as good a production of its kind as
Milton Royle's "Captain Impudence,"
which opened at the California Theater
last night.
The drama, which has been playing all
along the road by its other name of
"Mexico," depicts scenes supposed to have
happened during the Mexican war.
A number of United States officers,
resplendent in full - dress uniforms,
as well as many Mexican veterans , con
spicuous by their badges, had turned out
to welcome "Captain Impudence." The
latter grew quite enthusiastic over the
picturesque scenes, particularly the inter
ior view of the fortress at Chapultepec,
but they were heard to murmur that in
their experiences they had lighted upon
more fig hiing and less love-making.
'â¢Captain Impudence" does not pretend,
however, to be a war drama. It is a pretty
and effective story of what n-ight have
happened when the United States troops
were in Mexico if the sisters and
cousins and aunts of the officers) had
been part of the impedimenta of
the army, and if a dashing and
ingenious young captain, in love with his
major's daughter, had had the somewhat ]
questionable happiness of winning the
uncaught affections of a beautiful se
norita, who loved him as tenderly and
humbly as the major's daughter loved
him pertly and imperiously.
Of course in critical moments Miss Lu
cretia Bugg, the major's daughter, as
sumed the command â daughters of officers
always do in war dramasâ but Miss Lu
cretia defied her parent before the
privates in a manner that must have
been very humiliating to the ma
jor. On one occasion, when the j
downtrodden man had comtranded
Captain Impudence's arrest for permitting
the senorita to escape, Lucretia struck an
attitude, and â with the whole regiment
looking on â commanded the major to
refrain. Needless to .say, that officer at
once recognized the superior wisdom of
his daughter's judgment.
It was this audacious young lady that
Captain Impudence tried* to subdue by a
high-handed method of love-making,
which so incensed her that she solemnly
vowed not to marry till her parent, who
was a widower,should marry also. The cap
tain,a part which Milton Royle played with
plenty of fire, tempered with discretion,
rinding himself cutoff by this bond from
all hopes of earthly happiness, entered
into a conspiracy with Mrs. General Trigg,
a widow, to ensnare the major's affections.
From the fascinating way in which Selina
Letter Royle playe I the part every one saw
I from the outset that it was a foregone con
clusion that the major would ultimately
be led into the bonds of holy matrimony.
The sympathetic interest 01 the play cen
tered round Jovita Talamanca, the' poor
senorita, whose father had been killed in
battle by Captain Shields, otherwise Cap
tain Impudence. The young man tried to
atone to the girl, who was held as a
hostage, for * the injury he had un
wittingly done her, and in so doing
he won her passionate adoration,
which resulted in a jealous revenge and
repentance, on which the plot of the
drama is largely based. Madeline Merli
as the senorita" was a complete success.
Her voice is low and sweet and she played
her part caressingly, sadly, and yet with
a due admixture of passion and revenge.
In spite of her unrequited love the senor
ita never loses her dignity.
Gretchen Lyons was becomingly pert
and pretty and shallow as the triumphant
I Lucretia, and Lucius Henderson made a
I villainously wicked part of Mendoza, the
Mexican spy, whose fate is left in obscur
ity at the end of the drama. Ben Johnson
was excellent as the colored servant of the
captain.
Taken altogether ''Mexico" is an inter
esting and effective play. The action
never lags, and a happy medium is struck
between comedy and pathos. The staging
is good, and excellent taste is shown in
| dressing the women in the costumes of
| the period, instead of committing the
i anachronism of wearing end of the century
gowns.
At the Columbia,
"A Texas Steer," that is, Charles Hoyt's
sparkling comedy of that name, makes the
Columbia quite as lively as would the animal
himself. The piece, while thoroughly amus
ing, is none the less quite a deep study in
I certain phases of human nature. The foibles
of the nouyeau riche are laid bare with a rutn
less, merciless scalpel, while the underlying
goodness in the average man or woman is
made to come to light in spite of whims and
idiosyncrasies. One of the most effective
scenes, and certainly the noisiest, is in the
second act, where three Texan rangers spread
dismay amid the guests at a very select dinner
party, becoming so enthused ou hearing
their State well spoken of that they indulge in
the demonstrations of applause and
end by firing their revolvcis into the air, to
everybody's consternation.
The piece is called one of Hoyt's best, which
is no faint praise, and requires a well-balanced,
intelligent cast. A play like "A Texas Steer"
may be delightfully amusing or tiresomely
coarse, according to the manner in which it is
acted. The people now at the Columbia cer
tainly understand their business and sustain
their roles most ably. Tim Murphy as Maver
ick Brander, a Texas cattle king, is excellent,
of course. People would be surprised if he
were not. Messrs. Marlow, Adams and Manley
as Major Yell, Colonel BrÃggand General Blow,
Texan members of the Farmers' Alliance, are
perhaps just a trifle overdrawn, but charm
ingly unconventional. Lizzie au RoiasÃrand
er's wife and Dorothy Sherrod as Bossy, Brand
er's pet,, are very good.
Next week the extravaganza, "Sinbad," will
be given. It is understood that several new
features have been added to this piece since its
first presentation here.
Grand Opeia-House.
The Grand has been giving its patrons thrill
ing melodrama lately, sandwiched with mirth
provoking humor of Gilbert and Goldie, and
both extremes of the dramatic bill of fare have
been applauded to the echo.
Last night, for instance, when that affecting
melodrama, "Hoop of Gold," was produced,
the sandwich style of entertainment caused
the gallery especially to howl and whistle with
delight. No s >oner had the woes of the hero
ine extracted the tributary tear, than Gilbert
nnd Goldie's humor made people laugh till they
cried. The heroine had a terrible scene with
her brutal, drunken husband, and, goaded to
despair, she seized her infant in her arms and
rushed out into the cold, cruel world. As she
did so Gilbert and Goldie came on and did a
number of "turns," including a comic hyp
notic semice, all of which were frantically ap
plauded.
The scene changed to a street, where the
heroine and her babe were almost perishing
of cold and hunger. Fred Butier, as the vil
lain, appeared and offered gold as the price of
iai&my. The heroine spurned him ami the

listeners trembled for her fate, when Gilbert,
disguised as a comic policeman, shuffled on
the scene and the audience applauded fran
tically, for they knew that all would now be
well. All through the play the sandwich pro
cess was continued and it gave unqualified de
lieht.
"Hoop of Gold" was well acted by the stock
company, and the scenery included a splen
didly realistic representation of Westminster
bridge, from the Surrey side, with the clock
tower, the houses of Parliament and the
Thames embankment seen by night across the
water.
Baldwin Theater.
There was a great attendance at the second
week of Hoyi's "A Milk White Flag," which
began at the Baldwin last night. As usual the
sprightly satire and the clever specialties were
warmly applauded.
At the Alcazar.
An innovation has been introduced at the
Alcazar which has thus far proven very suc
cessful as an attraction, though, to be sure, it
is only two days old. On Sunday afternoon the
first performance of the "continuous show"
was given, and has since run day and night to
large and appreciative houses. The prices for
admission range irom 10 to 25 cents, and
matinees are given daily.
This week's bill is a high-class vaudeville
performance, and many of the numbers are
well worth seeing. Miss Josephine Gassman
in her serio-comic song specialties is as deserv
edly a favorite as ever. In the farcica.' sketch,
"My Wife's Husbands," she divided the ap
plause with Leonard Grover, both being ap
plauded to the echo.
Messrs. Star Key and Rathbun , on the triple
horizontal bars, performed some acrobatic
feats which called forth many expressions of
wonder and delight, particularly from the
younger portion ot the house. The other num
bers on the programme were well chosen and
effective, while the orchestral interludes em
braced several classic com positions which were
admirably rendered.
At the Tivoli.
Wallace's tuneful opera "Maritana," though
heard so oft, was warmly welcomed at the
Tivoli last night. The gems of the composition
are sung in nearly every household, but per
haps that very fact made them the more fully
appreciated by the large aucience. The cos
tumes, scenery and stage effects are effective
and in good taste, while the cast is exception
ally wel! selected. W. H. West makes Charles
II look every inch a king, while Ferris Hart
man gets what fun can be extracted from the
role ot the Marquis de MonieÃore. Kate Mar
chi as Lazarillo is charmingly piquante, while
Carrie Roma makes a beautiful Maritana.
"Said Pasha" will be the next attraction,
and "Blue Beard" is promised for Easter week.
1 At the Orphenm.
There is nothing like a first-class variety
show to draw a crowd, and the Orpheum
people know it. This week they have a num
ber of new attractions. The Dc Filippis in
their original dance, "On the Boulevard," are
a marvel of fantastic grace, while Al and
Mamie Anderson in their plantation sketch,
"On the Old Virginia Shores," were very good.
Rachel Walker's bell-like tones cnarm all who
hear them, and it looks as though her engage
ment would be a long one. Several good artists
add tneir quota to the interesting programme.

THEY SAW TWO MEN RUN
Fresno Boys Who Were Near the
McWhirter Murder
Scene.
THE STORY TOLD BY A STUDENT
Edward Perkins Talks of What He
and Pearl Stellberg Knew
About the Murder.
Edward Perkins of Fresno is a student at
the Dental College of the California State
"University, which department has its head
quarters in the Donohoe building on
Market street.
He is one of the two young men who are
said to have seen the McWhirter murder
ers running from the scene of the tragedy,
and sensational assertions of what they
might prove in court nave been circulated
during the past few days.
It has been said that they would swear
to the identity of tne men that they saw
running, but according to a statement
made for The Call by Perkins there is no
foundation for that rumor.
District Attorney Snow of Fresno has
been in this City, and according to a dis
patch sent from this City to a Fresno paper
he wa3 engaged in lookinc up this new
evidence. It was stated that on the night
of the murder two boys and two girls, who
â¢were well known in Fresno, were in an
alley near the McWhirter residence when
the crime was committed and by whom the
assassins ran so closely in their flight that
they were recognized.
This information, it -was suggested, had
been withheld at the time of the trial on
account of the desire to avoid publicity.
Edward Perkins, one of the young men
referred to, is studying dentistry in the lo
cal college.
"Oh, I ain't going to tell about that," he
said yesterday in response to a Call repre
sentative's inquiry. "I do not want to get
into trouble about the case."
He was askÂ«Kl whether it was true that
he could identify the men that he had
seen running from the place of the mur
der, and then he said :
"Oh, no! I have never said any such
thing aa that. Pearl Steliing, a young
man who is now living at Santa Ana, was
with me the night of the murder and we
were near the McWhirter house. We
heard the sound of a pistol and Pearl said
to me, 'There'sbeen some shooting.' Then
somebody came running toward us and I
thought at first it was some horses, they
made so much noise, but in a few seconds
â we saw two men.
"There were two men and only two who
ran near to where we were, but of course I
could not say that there were nototners
concerned in the shooting. It was impos-
Bible to see who the men wers and we
could only tell that there were two men
there. We could not see enough of the
men to enable us to recognize them and I
haven't the slightest idea as to how the men
looked.
"Anything; that we could have told
â¢would have been of no advantage in a
murder trial, so we did not say anything
about what we saw. I mentioned it to
somebody awhile ago though and now it
has become public. All that I can tell
about the case is that there is no doubt in
my mind that McWhirter was murdered.
He did not commit suicide."
A dispatch sent out from Fresno yester
day says :
District Attorney Snow, when Interviewed in
the matter, denied most emphatically that the
object of his visit to San Francisco had any
connection with the McWhirter case whatever.
He further stated that no new evidence of an
important nature had come into his posses
sion. Mr. Snow was at a loss to know how the
rumor started, and he believes that it was a
political canard.
The gentlemen alleged to have been accesso
ries to the crime with Heath, who was tried
twice on the charge of the murder of McWhlr
ter, are quite prominent in this section of the
State. Both are lawyers, one having occupied
the Superior bench in this county a few years
Bince. The other gentleman is practicing law
in San Francisco.
While little credit is placed in this latest re
port concerning the crime, it is generally be :
lieved that 6ome important developments will
arise at no distant date. The suicide theory,
which was at one time accepted by many peo
ple, finds little or no indorsement at the pres
ent time, the general belief now being that
McWhirter's death was a cold-blooded murder.
While tbe testimony of Perkins and
Stellberg may nave no direct bearing on
the murder case it may figure in the suit
for insurance if that should be brought up
again. McWhirter's life was insured for
$50,000, and the claim was defeated on the
ground that the man had committed sui
cide.
PUTTING UP HIGH FENCES
The Effect of Declaring Invalid
an Ordinance of the Su
pervisors.
There Is No Limit to the Altitude at
Which Mural Advertisements
May Loom.
"Yes," said Assistant Chief Dougherty
of the Fire Department, "the bill-posters
are putting up twenty-foot fences all over
and we cannot do anything to stop them,
for Judge Seawell has knocked out the or
dinance under which we were taking down
the fences that exceeded ten feet in height."
Several months ago Chief Sullivan noti
fied the owners of land on which fences
higher than ten feet had been erected for
advertising purposes that tbeir fences
were there in violation of an ordinance of
the City and that they must come down
to the height mentioned in the ordinance.
In some instances the ordinance was com
plied with, but where it was not the Chief
caused the fences to be taken down, and
continued m this work until stopped by
an order of court, an injunction having
been prayed for by Mrs. J. Dunphy, who
is in tbe bill-posting business, and whose
interests were affected.
Recently Judge Seawell made the in
junction permanent, and in his decision
held that a person had a right to erect on
his premises such structure as he deems
proper as long as he does not injure an
other. He held, further, that there is no
question of the power of the municipality
to establish in thickly settled portions of a
city certain limits within which it may
prohibit the erection of wooden buildings,
but that it has no right to make the same
regulations in reference to rural or unset
tled portions of the city where the spread
ing of a conflagration to other property
could not possibly be affected by the erec
tion of such structures as fences.
The offense under tuo ordinance, he
Raid, is not in the erecting of fences more
than ten feet in height, but solely in
placing an advertisement thereou; that if
tiie signs are effaced, there ceases to be the ]
cause for a penalty. Ordinances of a mu
nicipal corporation, he said, if not reason
able are invalid.
""They have got an army of men build
ing fences all over the City outside the fire
limits," said the Assistant Chief, and as
they are building them between buildings
they will carry a conflagration as readily
as if within the fire limits.
ROSS JACKSON ILL.
The Popular Journalist Slowly Re
covering: at His Hotel From a
Severe Sickness.
The many friends of J. Ross Jackson,
the genial bohemian and all-round good
fellow, will be glad to hear that he is re
covering from a severe attack of illness.
Mr. Jackson dropped out of siÂ»ht a little
over three weeks ago aud since that time
he has been constantly missed about town.
His colleagues in the journalistic profes
sion marveled that he should have held
himself aloof from the Press Club, until
they learned of his sickness.
When he began to feel unwell Mr. Jack
son went down to Gilroy Springs, thinking
that the water would improve his condi
tion. Instead of mending under the in
fluence of the mineral waters he rapidly
became worse, and at last alarming symp
toms showed themselves. At this juncture
he telegraphed for his wife and daughter,
who were in San Francisco, to come at
once to him. They found him very low
from a bilious disorder and kidney troubles,
but with careful nursing they got him
upon his feet, and he so far improved as to
be able to return home about s week ago.
The San Francisco physicians found that
the whole trouble came through the nerves
from a disease of the eyes, and a specialist
performed a delicate operation on Mr.
Jackson's right eye. The patient did not
respond to ether, and consequently was
semi-conscious while the oculist removed
the eye and made a complete examination,
all of which occupied just an hour. It was
found that the eye could be saved and so
it wa!} put back," but the strain upon the
nervous system was prostrating. Since
the operation, however, Mr. Jackson has
been steadily improving, and he hopes to
be quite recovered after a short while.
For the present he is compelled to sit in
a darkened room at the St. Nicholas Hotel,
and as the doctors deny him to friends, he
takes things philosophically and moralizes
with himself on the follies of life.
A SCHOOL OF THEOLOGY
Methodist Pastors Desire Such
an Institution for Cali
fornia.
Rev. Robert Whittaker Gives Bap
tist Ministers Some Hints on
Conferences.
Methoaist Episcopal circles ,are deeply
interested just at present over tbe ques
tion of founding a school of theology for
California. Rev. Robert Bentley, who
lectured on the subject at the Methodist
preachers' meeting yesterday, suggested
that the school ought to be opened not
later than August and that Berkeley
would be an excellent location for it, as
students would there have university
facilities for studying the dead languages.
Rev. jL>r. Case said in discussing the
paper: "We need such a school and need
it at once." Rev. Dr. Carroll thought
that there should be a prospect of solid
financial support before steps were taken
for inaugurating the school, but Rev. Dr.
Kerby assured the meeting that the
school would Eoon be a reality, as forces
had for some time been at work which
would result in tbe means being fortu
co.ning at the proper time.
During the course of the- meeting a
resolution was unanimously adopted ex
pressing hearty indorsement of the work
of the deaconesses.
Congregational Meeting.
Professor J. H. Goodell addressed the
Congregational Club yesterday on "The
Times â Is There a Remedy?" On the one
hand, the speaker summarized the unsat
isfactory social, commercial and political
conditions oi the present day and on the
other hand he described the fever for re
form and. reorganization. The professor
urged unselfishness as being the only
medium which could make the fever for
reform produce practical results in chang
ing prevailing conditions.
Rev. F. Flawith said it was all very well
to talk of selfishness outside the churches,
but selfishness of the deepest dye was to
be found inside the churches. He added
that many churches were little more than
money-getting corporations.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper said: "I think
selfishness is the root of all sin. When
people in the churches tamper with their*
own consciences they are injuring the
cause."
Rev. Mr. Hood thought the picture was
drawn in too dark colors and Chaplain
Rowell said he found great unselfishness
in church circles.
Baptist Ministers.
Rev. Robert Whittaker yesterday morn
ing offered the Baptist Ministers' Confer
ence suggestions on "How to make our
denominational meetings more spiritually
effective." Lengthy and uninteresting
reports were stated to be one reason for
the decline of spirituality at these meet
ings. Mr. Whittaker not only suggested
abbreviating the reports, but added that
the conventions should be more spiritual
in character. His suggestions were
heartily indorsed by the pastors present
and the hope was freely expressed that
they would be carried into effect at the
Baptist Conference which will occur in
Oakland next October.
Presbyterian Pastors.
Expository preaching was the subject of
a paper read before the Presbyterian
Ministerial Association yesterday morn
ing by Rev. T. F. Day, D.D. The doctor
regretted the decline of expository preach
ing and urged preachers to saw their own
wood by studying the Scriptures pro
foundly in the original instead of taking
ideas from ready-made textbooks.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 17, 1896.
A PARK FOR THE MISSION
A Proposition to Purchase the
Old Jewish Cemetery for a
Public Park.
ONLY $200,000 NECESSARY.
â¢
Opinions of Leading Citizens as to
the Wants and Necessities of
Their Section.
The people residing on the southern por
tion of this peninsula have commenced to
make their presence known in the com
munity. This by demanding that their
portion of the City, known as "the Mis
sion," shall be recognized in the distribu
tion of the loaves and fishes, so to speak.
A thorough canvass of the entire Mission
district among the residents and property
owners would meet with but one expres
sion of opinion as regards their claim, and
in fact clamor for improvements.
They want a High School for their chil
dren in their own section of the City.
They consider it unjust to be compelled to
send their daughters from the extreme
southern limits of the county to Scott
and Geary streets to the Girls' High
School, or to Powell street between Clay
and Sacramento to the Normal School, or
to Bush and Stockton streets to the Com
mercial High School.
In the case of the boys, they have to
go to Sutter and Octavia streets to attend
the Lowell Boys' High School. And in
any and ail cases two carfares have to be
paid to reach the majority of any of the
higher schools since the economical and
thrifty Southern Pacific discontinued giv
ing transfers to the Sutter-street line at
Mission and Ninth streets.
Having started the high school agita
tion, and with a fair prospect of getting
what they have asked for, the Mission
people have now gone a step farther and
want a public park. There is some logic
in their claim that for years they have
been subscribing to the fund for beautify
ing and improving the northern and
western portions of the City by giving the
people of those sections parks and schools.
The scheme on foot now by the Mission
people is to have the Supervisors make
provisions in this year's tax levy for the
purchase of the old Jewish cemeteries,
bounded by Dolores street on the east,
Church street on the west, Eighteenth
on the north and Twentieth on the south.
The area of this is sufficiently large to
make a suitable park. The opinions of
some of the many residents in favor of
this plan is here given:
John D. Daley of 900 Guerrero street,
well known as an active citizen, said:
"Why should we not have both a high
school and a park? We have been paying
taxes all our lives for the benefit of other
people and we of the Mission have got
comparatively nothing in return. The
taxes this year will be the same as those
of last year. Well, all right, what of it?
Suppose the taxes are a little high, the
people get the benefit of it in the end. We
do not want to live in adobe houses all
our lives. We want good modern houÂ«ps,
good plumbing, good sewers, good streets,
the best of schools for onr children and
suitable parks for breathing-places and
recreation. What do we live for if not to
enjoy health and happiness for ourselves
and secure the same blessings for our
families and neighbors. Let us have the
park by all means."
These sentiments were fully indorsed by
J. 11. Roy, who resides on the San Bruno
road. J. L. Vermeil of 2651 Howard
street, F. H. Johnson of Fifteenth avenue,
on San Bruno road, and H. A. Clifford of
Bacon and Harvard streets.
Judge Van Reynegom, who was the
first to propose tbe removal of the ceme
tsries from the Mission ?ome ten years
a<?o, is heartily in sympathy with the
present movement. He said :
"I know of no place in the City any
better adapted for a park than that now
mentioned. Its contour could not be sur
passed. It is centrally located and well
protected from the westerly winds and
fogs. The sun shines in that little valley
when the other portions of the City are
enshrouded with fog. As regards the ex
pense, that is nothine when compared
with the benefits to be derived from it as a
park. And again, this park will not be for
a day or a yearâ it will be for all time to
come.
"As it is now the Mission people have
no public parks. There is a little patch of
land measuring 520 feet by 245 feet down
on Harrison and Treat | avenue designated
a â  public park â ' that sis :"â  not !: improved or
beautified, and to find it would require a
guide or a map of the City/";.:; ; ; f v '
"At the time that I started the removal
of the bodies from the cemeteries out there
I was opposed on all sides, but by reason
ing and arguments I convinced -those; op
posed to me, and now I am thanked on all
sides for the stand I tbeh'took.v I am now
in favor of the City buying the ground and
making an elegant park out of it." 'l
; . John H. Grady, a real estate agent who
resides at 330 Twenty : third street, and who
is president of the /association now advo
cating the high school question, ; 6aid
when spoken to on the park question: ~ v;
. - "Why, of course * I aru -;: in f avor 'j of r it.
W r e have a right to claim it. i Let us : see
whether the Mission people are entitled to
a park and a high school or not. : , ,; .. .;,
V '"The v assessed ;i valuation fof : property
between Market and Twenty-sixth - streets
is *, $96,000,000. On ?. that a there is paid in!
taxes r $2,000,000; â¢ expended 'â ; in 'â - improve
ments on the same section $45,000 yearly.
Eh ! ;. Ho y is f that s for , air ; Jay ?;' ; Now
don;t = you think that we i have done our
share in beautifying ; and =< improving the
City for our neighbors. It would be no
more than rieht that our neighbors should
let us have some of our own money back
for improving our section. ' ' :V ,
v "Looking at it from a conservative point
of view I think the two blocks mentioned
can be bought for $100,000 each or $200,000
or both. The land is considerably. under
grade, and inasmuch as it has ; been used
as a cemetery^ might -not be as; desirable ,
for residence as it is for a public park.
Hence it should be acquired at onceâ or
rather as soon as the money can be raised
by taxation for the purpose. "
YOUNG PATRIOTS.
Enthusiasm of Valentine Holt Society,
Children of the American Revo
lution.
A meeting of the Valentine Holt Society,
Children of the American Revolution, was
held yesterday afternoon at the residence
of Mrs. Dr. H. W. Yeamans, 711 Taylor
street.
The meeting, which was large and en
thusiastic, was opened by the singing of
the "Star-spangled Banner" and a salute
to the flag in these words, "I pledge my
allegiance to the flag ana the Republic, for
which it stands, one and indivisible with
liberty and justice for all."
The president, Mrs. S. L Hubbard,
announced that since the previous meet
ing a new member had oeeu enrolled,
Helen Matlaline Keeney, the four-month
old daughter of Dr. and Mrs. J. W.
Keeney and great-great-great-grand
daughter of Brigadier-General Laughlin
Mclntosh.
On motion of the vice-president, Sara C.
Bancroft, the following resolution in recog
nition of the gift of a nag presented to the
society by Mrs. Leland Stanford was
adopted by a rising vote:
Resnived, That we, the members of Valentine
Holt Society of the Children of the Revolution,
recognize in this gift another instance of the
kindness of heart that has ever prompted the
donor in promoting the happiness and interest
of children, and we wish to convey to her the
hope tnat her life may be prolonged many
years, and that she may bring to fruition the
plans and purposes of the noblest undertaking
of her own and her husband's lifeâ the found
ing of an institution for the education of the
children of the land.
On motion of Mrs. Phoebe W. Painter,
the society, by a unanimous vote, adopted
resolutions recognizing the courtesy of
Major William B. Hooper of the Occi
dental and the kindness shown by him on
Washington's birthday to the members in
allowing them the use of the large parlor
for a meeting place and for delicacies with
which he treated t>e children.
The president requested each member to
present at the next meeting some senti
ment respecting the American flag. The
meeting was brougbt to a close by the
singing of "America" and a salute to the
fiasr.
TO BUILD A BREWERY.
That Is What the Opponents
of the Beer Syndicate
Propose.
It Will Be Erected in San Francisco
and Will Cost, Fitted Up Com
plete, $100,000.
The movement against the beer syndi
cate of this City, which has for its purpose
the furnishing to retail dealers of the
amber liquid at lower rates than are
charged by the syndicate, which was
started about two months ago, is still a
tl ing of the present.
Frank Marty, who is the recognized head
of the movement, said yesterday that
those interested are still active, "but,"
said he, "we have to work very quietly,
because every move we make is watched
by the members of the syndicate, who do
all they can to prevent us if possible from
carrying out our project. Still we do not
care, for we are going ahead, slowly of
course, but surely, and there is no doubt
but we shall succeed.
"We have secured a piece of land on
which we will erect a brewery that will be
oi sufficient capacity to supply the greater
portion of the City. This will cost â to
build and fit up with .all that is necessary
in the way of machinery, vats, barrels,
kegs and everything else â something like
$100,000, and what is most pleasant is that
the money for the purpose will be forth
coming when it is needed.
"Whore are|we going to build? That, for
the reason I nave already stated, 1 cannot
disclose; but it is to be in tlie City, for
those who are to be our patrons and
whom we proposed to suppiy with beer
from an outside source are of the opinion
that in a matter of this kind the money
they will pay for the liquid suould not be
sent outside of San Francisco.
"At the time the combination of brew
ers occurred all joined but one, and when
the syndicate learned that we were nego
tiating with him he was induced to join
the combination, so we were shut out
from doing business with him.
"I think it will not be lonar before every
thing will be in working condition."
"ONE THAT I LOVE."
Sbe la the Occasion of Ferris Hart-
man's Appearance in a Tragic
Kole at Ingleside.
It seems the Tivoli's funny man can be
serious on occasions. The public, gener
ally speaking, look upon Ferris Hartman
as a sparkling professional wit, lie voted
mainly, if not exclusively, to the light
some taste of singing side-splitting ditties
for the amusement of his numerous cli
entele.
One Green, a horse-trainer at the Ingle
side track, has, however, had a chance to
know Mr. Hartman in another capacity.
It seems that the singing punster, when
he can steal an cour between rehearsal
and performance, likes to take a turn on
horseback, a recreation which brings out
his personal attractions to great advan
tage. He rides a three-year-old filly, ro
mantically called "Una Que Amo," or,
for those who prefer our rugged English
idiom to the silvery language of Cervan
tes, "One That I Love." For some reason
which he did not state, since no one could
oblige him to state it, Mr. Hartman took
a notion to transfer his favorite from the
Ingleside Btables to those at the Bay Dis
trict track. This met with strenuous op
position from the trainer, Green, occasion
ing frequent exchanges of rather highly
seasoned compliments between him and
the laughter-making nightingale of the
TivoJi.
At length, tired of bootless skirmishes,
Mr. Hartman went to the stables and de
manded his iilly. He was met with evasive
answers. Green, it would appear, had
formed a tender attachment for the win
some equine belle, and was loth to give
her up. Mr. Hartman is not lacking in
mettle, and straightway sought a search
warrant empowering him to look for "Una
quA Amo," and, finding her, to lead her
off in triumph.
When he returned to Ingleside last
Thursday he. was armed with a formidable
legal document and accompanied by two
brawny policemen. Grimly exhibiting
the paper, much as the High Sheriff in
"Mary Stuart" unfolds the death warrant
in the presence of the hapless Queen of
Scots, the funny man, transformed into a
tragedian of the first water, sulked
through the stables till he found his filly,
and made off with her.
"One that I love" is staying for the
present at the Bay District track, and
Ferris Hartman was last seen, apparently
much at ease, on the front steps of the
Tivoli. Green now and then looks wist
fully at a vacant stall, but is doing as well
as oould be expected.
"There won't be any trouble," remarked
Mr. Hartman, when spokan to yesterday
about the affair. "I don't see how there
can be. If the filly is mine I ought to
have possession of . her. Don't you
think so?"

HOW THE FARMERS ANGLE
A Deputy Fish Commissioner's
Novel Experience on Deer
Creek.
Pitchforks in Winter and Fishing-
Poles in Summerâ Trap-Shoot.
ing Tournaments.
Deputy Fish Commissioner Cross re
turned yesterday from Skaggs Springs and
states that the people who reside near Dry,
Warm Sprinpr, Picnic, Ranchera and Pena
creeks, are strongly of the opinion that
killing trout with spears is perfectly law
ful and affords far greater pleasure than
angling with a rod. The deputy endeav
ored to explain to them that spearing fish
was contrary to law, and that he would ar
rest all persons he found killing fish by
means of spear or gaff.
"Well, my dear fellow, you can do all
the arresting you please, but you can't
convict one of us in this county*" retorted
an old farmer who had been angling with
pitchforks for many years. "We are sat
isfied to allow those rod fellows to tramp
over our lands and slash our streams to
their hearts' content after the Ist of April,
but dol gam it, those fancy boys from the
City and elsewhere must remember that
the winter is our season for fishing and we
are perfectly satisfied to give the summer
to the City boys who are content with a
basket of fish about the size of your little
finger; let us alone and we won't bother
you people; we kill only what we want to
eat and leave no waste.''
The deputy argued with the country fel
lows and told them that every large fish
they killed meant the loss of 500 small fish
to the stream it was taken from, but when
he iound that argument was useless he de
parted, wondering how many years would
pass away before those good-natured coun
try fellows will leara that by protecting

the breeding fishes they will have streams
teeming with trout and anglers from this
City and elsewhere who will visit their
neighborhood and teave many dollars be
hind during the summer months.
Mr. Cross stated that large steelheads
were very plentiful in Dry Creek and that
good fishing will certainly result in April.
"I was surprised to see trout from a
quarter of a pound to a pound in weight,"
continued the deputy, "jumping at small
colored flies that were dropping from the
trees on the water. Those lies were evi
dently March browns.
"Notwithstanding the inclemency of the
weather, there were eight or ten anglers
from this City at Point Reyes on Sunday.
Three large fish were caugtit, and by very
poor handling of the rod G. McGVeggor
lost a fish that would scale ten pounds.
Paper-mill Creek rose three feet, since Sun
day evening and is now running very
muddy."
The' Empire Gun Club will meet on Sun
day next at Alameda Point, where an arti
ficial-bird shoot will be held.
On the same day the sportsmen of
Davisville will enjoy a live-bird shooting
contest. The great event of the month in
trap-shooting sports will take place on the
'29th inst. at Sacramento. The Blue-
Rock Club will give one of its well-patron
ized inanimate target tournaments.
Tom Clark, Jack Lang, Tom Riley and
J. Westwater returned from an eel hunt in
Halfmoon Bay yesterday morning wetter
but wiser men for having ventured such a
distance in stormy weather for the sake of
sport and fish.
A few large sea eels were captured by the 1
fishermen, but generally speaking they
caught more water than fish. The fisher
men's provisions for the trip consisted of
fonr bottles of hot stuff and half a dozen
sea biscuits, generously donated by l^rank
Anzonetti.

NEW FUBLICAJTIONS^^
PROMISES ARE NOT CASH.
An Important Point for Bidders
on Franchises and
Privileges.
Gross Receipts Are Too Unstable to
Be the Basis of a Good
Bid.
The Supreme Court has decided that tba
tender of a percentage of the gross receipts
of a franchise is not cash in the sense of
making the highest "cash" bidder.
Arthur D. Thompson sued to have the
Supervisor of Alameda County compelled
to recognize him as the highest bidder on a
franchise, but they refused, and on appeal
the Supreme Court has sustained the rul
ing.
A road might be built for the purpose of
stopping competition, says the Supreme
Court, and the bidders might care nothing
at all if the gross receipts were merely
nominal, so long as the franchise was
theirs and competition was stopped. The
statutes contemplate cash, the court says,
and a promise to pay a percentage is not
by any means cash.
A vision of the phantom car on Bush
street must have passed through the minds
of the judges as they wrote : "A franchise
might be secured to prevent competition."
One hundred per cent of the gross receipts
of the Bush-street line might be given the
City and still, as the Supreme Court says,
it would not by any means be cash."

Celebrations in Honor of the
Motherland and St.
Patrick.
MUSIC, SONG AND ORATORY.
Father Ferguson's Eloquent Address
on the Glory snd Achievement
of the Celtic Race.
San Francisco will wake up United
States this morning, but it is likely to
go to bed Irish to-nightâ for it is St. Pat
rick's day and every liishman will extend
the glad hand to his neighbor. The cele
bration of the apostolic anniversary, which
is observed generally by the Celtic race as
a national holiday, really began last night
â with entertainments of a musical and lit
erary character.
The entertainment held in MetrODolitan
Temple last night under the auspices of
the Christian Doctrine Society, was an un
alloyed success.
Rev. J. P. Ferguson's oration was the
feature of the evening, but the large au
dience found nothing to criticize other
than favorably in the exercises which pre
ceded and followed his address.
The programme was carried out as fol
lovrs:
Organ selections. Professor R. J. Harrison;
recitation, "Prayer to St. Patrick," Miss Emma
Himmelstoss; chorus, "Up for the Green,"
Erin Choral Circle; dance fantasie, Miss Gertie
Uogan aud Miss Annie McDonnell, accom

fetrel Boy," Harry Dlnan; song and march,

Â«ell; violin solo, "Spanische Tanze," Frank
Hess, accompanist Miss Julia Hefiernan;
tenor solo, "Astnore," R. D. Vallerga; "Co
lumbia and Lrin," a poem written for this oc
casion by Miss Harriet M. Skidmore (Marie);
Columbia, Miss Rosella la Faille; Erin, Miss
Cornelia Stanley; chorus and march, memters
of Erin Choral Circle; nag dance, Misses Ethel
and Viola Winters; accompanist, Miss Alicia

leen Mavourncen," Mrs^McKee Wilz, Mrs. J. B.
Bruce, Miss M. F. Code, James Lane, Joseph
Fogarty; cornet solo, "Last Rose of Summer,"
John E. Kennedy ; recitation (selected), Frank
Mcdlynn; chorus, "St. Patrick's Day," Erin
Choral Circle.
The Rev. Mr. Ferguson spoke in sub- j
stance as follows:
It has been said that no pen has ever done |
justice to Ireland's patron saint.
When St. Patrick landed on the shores of
Ireland he found a people at once ignorant
and honest. He converted them to Christianity
in sixty years without the loss of one drop of I
blood. The day which is devoted to his !
memory brings a feelincr <^f loyalty to every j
Irish heart. He taught them not only Chris-"!
tianity. but the principles of patriotism and
democracy. He taught them the principles of
Christian "faith and national aspiration.
Inonehand he had the gospel and in the
other the constitution of human rights and
liberty. He instilled in the hearts of all
Irishmen the love of equality and liberty.
There is a certain fitness in celebrating St. |
Patrick's day in this country. It bears a direct '
connection with the historical incidents of j
this country. Washington, the great, won a |
grand victory on the 17th of March, and in
recognition of the valor of the Celts who were \
in his grand army he ordered that the pass
word and countersign on that day ot the
month should be "St. Patrick."
Ireland has al'.vays been tne loyal friend of
America. Every irishman in tbe United States
Is a lover of liberty, and most of them have
borne arms in defense of their adopted coun
try's lioerty.
A tior referring to the great work of Ire
land's apostle in converting the people to
Christianity, etc., then relations of Ireland
with this Republic were dwelt on.
Never in this Republic's history have the men
of Irish birth restricted themselves in America's
hour of peril to expressions of good will. When
our Continental Congress was powerless, and
our troops were starving at Valley Forge, the
most unstinted contributions for the support
of the Continental army came from the friendly
sons of St. Patrick in Philadelphia; and ac
cording to the testimony taken on tfie conduct
of the revolutionary war before a committee
of ttie House of Commons, half of the Conti
nental army serving on the side of the revolt
ing colonies were men wno had been born in
Ireland.
It is impossible to overrate the magnitude of
our National indebtedness to the Irish. When
â¢â ye were weak they were strong, and in our
struggle ior independence they threw the
â whole moral weight of Ireland on our side.
The sympathy of Irishmen with Americans
had by 1782 become universal and outspoken,
aad It was their insubordinate and mutin
ous attitude which, more than the sur
render of Cornwallis, and more eten
than the tbjeatened combination of
European powers, wrung from George 111 a
reluctant acquiescence in the loss of colonies
which he rightly considered the jewels of his
crown. The enemies of Irishmen are now, as
they have always been, the enemies of Amer
ica." The only friends America has in England
to-day are those who are determined to deal
justly by Ireland and the Irish. The British
aristocrats, wno are inflexibly opposed to
granting Ireland self-government, are the
same men who to-aay view with malignant
hate the interference of this country in behalf
of Venezuela.
They are the children of the men who desired
the recognition of the Confederacy, not from
any particular love of the South, but more
from hatred of the North and eagerness to dis
rupt the Union. They are the descendants of
the men who in the early days of this century
kidnapped our sailors and destroyed out com
merce; and who in the resultant war commit
ted acts of vandalism at Washington, such as
they would have been aehained to have perpe
trated in any European capital.
The afternoon exercises attending the
celebration of St. Patrick's day at Wood
ward's Pavilion will begin promptly at 2
o'clock. There will be a second celebra
tion in the evening commencing at 8
o'clock. Irish music will be rendered con
tinuously during the afternoon and even
ing. The celebrations promise to exceed
all previous efforts of the kind.
Among the other celebrations announced
to take place this evening are the follow
ing:
The twenty-seventh annual ball of the
Knights of the Red Branch will be given
in Odd Fellows' Hall.
The Young Ladies' Sodality of St. James'
parish will give an entertainment in Mis
sion Parlor Hall on Seventeenth street.
A rally and entertainment will be given
by Company M, League of the Cross
cadets, in St. Francis Hall.
Tne Knights of St. Patrick will banquet
at Delmonico'e.
STUDENTS CELEBRATE.
Entertainment at Sacred Heart
College In Honor of the
Festival.
The class of 1896 of Sacred Heart College
celebrated the festival of St. Patrick last
night in the large ball of the college at
Eddy and Larkin streets. The hall was
densely crowded with friends of the boys,
and it was quite evident that everybody
present enjoyed the programme im
mensely. In honor of the day green bunt
ing was elaborately displayed, with Irish
flags forming bannerets round the walls
and upon the stage, and with the green
was lioerally woven America's emblem,
which was draped from the stage wings as
a background.
The entertainment began with an over
ture of Irish national airs by the Sacred
Heart College orchestra under the direc
tion of Brother Hosea. after which the fol
lowing programme was presented in a

REPUBLICANS ARE ACTIVE
Eclipse Cast by John L. Sullivan
on an Acrobatic
Show.
Important Meeting of the Fifth Con
gressional District Committee
This Morning.
The stairs leading to the Republican
headquarters creaked all day yesterday
beneath the feet of hundreds of active,
enthusiastic Republicans on their way to
meet political friends and discuss with
them the coming victorj of protection for
California. Among the throng was a
raisin-grower from the San Joaquin Valley.
He said that he had always been a Demo
crat while working for others, but that he
found Democracy a heavy burden to bear
as soon as he became the possessor of
twenty acres of raisin vine 3.
"My party has refused to give me the
advantage of a cent or two a pound in the
way of protection from the fierce competi
tion of my Spanish rival, who can hire
labor for 10 cents a day. My rival the
other day trampled upon the stars and
stripes, while I am ready to die in defense
of that flag. But the Democratic party
buys its raisins from the Spaniard and
tells me that I oogbt to starve myself and
mv family for principle. That's why lam
a Republican to-day. I have found, after
bitter experience with the Democracy, that
the Republican party is the friend of the
poor man."
The proposition that California is going
Republican this year from the top to the
bottom of the ticket has gone beyond the
pale of surmise or argument. It is a po
litical axiom. The great activity locally
in the Republican ranks is a Btriking evi
dence of this fact.
Around the Baldwin Hotel last night
Ssnator Mahoney represented the two
votes, the two forged, proxies and the one
genuine proxy that represent the Ma
honey-Kelly acrobatic troupe of the
Fourth Congressional District. But when
John L. Sullivan sallied forth on his way
to the theater the Senator and the ghosts
of his proxies retired behind a very large
sized eclipse.
Two rather queer political combinations
were noted in the billiard-room. At one
table Blinker Murphy and Speaker Lynch
of the Assembly were engaged in a friendly
game of billiards. Mr. Lynch wore a
shamrock on his left lapel out of compli
ment to St. Patrick's day this morning,
wiiile Blinker relied upon bis open conn
tenance for recognition as a true son of
Erin.
At another table were ex-Judge Tread
well and Police Judge Campbell, knocking
spots out of the balls and stabbing great
gashes in the creen cloth at every masse
shot. They displayed no Bhamrocks. Judge
Treadwoll wore a new plug hat and Judge
Campbell wore his â¢whiskers.
The meeting of the Fifth Congressional
Committee, which will take place at 11
o'clock this morning in the Crocker build
ing, is expected to prove of more than or
dinary interest. Nothing was given out
last night as to what was to be donp for
the reason that no plan- of action will be
decided upon until the committee meet.
For Kicking a Woman.
Charles Newland, keeper of a sailors' lodging
house, 106 Steuart street, was arrested last
night on the charge of battery. Maggie Ander
son, a well-known character on the water
front, alleged that Newland kicked her on ihe
abdomen and seriously injured her. She was
taken to the Receiving Hospital. Newland de
nied the chtirge. Maggie had been rooming in
his place for three or four days, but how she
was injured be did not know.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MABCH 17, 3896.
THE STRIKE IS STILL ON
No Great Change in the Situa
tion With the Union
Painters.
ARE CONFIDENT OF SUCCESS.
The Master Painters Slow in Making
an Answerâ Other Labor
Organizations.
The painters' strike is still on and will
be until the Master Painters' Association
give in to the terms of the strikers. It
was expected that the bosses would meet
last night and decide upon some course,
but from all that can be learned the meet
ing was postponed until to-night. The
master painters are very secretive as to
what they are contemplating or what ac
tion they will take.
At any rate, the strikers are confident of
winning the tight. The majority of the
union painters are at work for the bosses
who have agreed to all terms. Thus the
pressure of the strike has been greatly re
lieved and the men are not as restless as
they usually are under such circumstances.
COMMITTEE REPORTS.
Many Men and Shops Discussed at
the Afternoon Meeting.
The regular open meeting of the striking
painters was held yesterday at 115 Turk
street, President Rose presiding. Most of
the session passed in listening to reports.
One of the relief committee stated that he
had received word that the next steamer
from Portland, Or., will bring down a
number of painters to take the places of
the strikers. Many of this class came from
the country in the belief that they will se
cure a living from the relief committee of
the strikers upon the threat of going to
work on the struck jobs. It will hardly be
safe for them to be caught by the strikers.
A report was made that five of St. Denis'
painters working at Menlo Park had de
clined to return to work yesterday morn
ing. The report was verified by one of
those who quit, who said that it- will tie
up the Menlo job.
F. M. Ambrose of 1624 Powell street sent
a letter stating that be will recognize the
card system and employ only union men.
Frank of 1002 Pacilic street.sent a similar
letter.
A letter from the San Francisco Trades
Council stated:
1 must say that the orderly and businesslike
way in which you have conducted this strike
meets with our hearty approval and is cer
tainly deserving of the commendation of all
fair-minded persons. If, in any possible way,
we can render you assistance we are ready and
willing to do "so. Trusting that victory may
attend your efforts, we are, gentlemen and
brothers, fraternally yours.
San Francisco Labor Council.
Per E. P. Bcbman. *
The resolutions passed by the same body
on Friday night were read.
Daniel^onof the North Beach committee
found that there were eight non-union
painters at work on Kuss' job at the Pre
sidio. Got two men out. Several of the
men came from Oakland and Alameda.
On the way back we picked up four other
non-union"meu. J..C. Sellers has given in.
A. H. Herringer of Larkin street declines
to give in to the demand and says he will
not pay over $2.
Hopps <fe Son of Pine street is regarded
as a union shop because the people in the
shop have all sent for applications .for'
membership.
The polishers' committee reported that
the two non-union polishers, William
Henry and the man Known as Russian
Sam, "are still at work in the Parrott build
ing. The committee recommended that
the two men be blacklisted and black
ballejj should they ever apply for admis
sion to membership. The men are at
work for Kuss of Sutter street. There is a
polisher from Oakland at work for Kuss in
the Parrott building.
A motion wa9 made that the union put
up a blacklist of all journeymen who have
persisted and still decline to unite with
the union. Mclvor opposed giving such
men any prominence at the present stage
of the game. It was decided not to make
a public blacklist as it would only give
those men a value, as their services would
be sought by the bosses who are enemies
of the union.
Several matters of minor importance
were discussed before the meeting ad
journed.
PAINTSHOP RULES.
The Union Discusses Apprentices,
Foremen, Laborers and Other
Matters,
The hall at 115 Turk street was crowded
last evening at the regular meeting of the
Painters' and Decorators' Union. Nearly
200 new members were initiated, and this
leaves less than 200 non-union painters in
the City. As the Master Painters' Associ
ation had sent no reply to the strikers the
matter of the present difficulty wss not
discussed at length.
Considerable time was given, however,
to the formation of the new shop rules. It
was decided to allow one apprentice to ten
men in each shop, each apprentice to serve
at least three yearÃ and receive journey
man's wages upon attaining his majority.
One non-union foreman will be allowed to
each shop if desired. Laborers may be
employed in the shops at laborers' wages,
but no laborer shall perform journeyman's
work.
Another open meeting will be held at 3
o'clock to-day.
THE NEW WORKING-CARD.
Union Carpenters Decide to Stand
to Their Colors or
Perish.
The Building Trades' Council's working
card system will go into effect on April 1,
and on that day small slips of cardboard
will be issued to nearly 40,000 workmen in
this City. Under thia system no union
workman will be permitted to work on a
job with a non-union man. Should a
building contractor attempt to force a
non-union man upon a job the union mÂ«n
will be compelled to quit and tie up the
job at once.
That this may be productive of serious
consequences and possibly result in
another strike coes without saying. This
subject and its possibilities was seriously
discussed last evening at the meeting of
Carpenters' and Joiners' unions 483 and
304. The debates lasted until a late hour,
but all the carpenters decided to a man to
stand by the working-card system, come i
what may, even though every piece of
work in the City is tied up in a strike.
OAKLAND MEN WAITING.
If the San Francisco Painters Win
They Too Will Strike.
The union painters and decorators of
Oakland, and in fact Alameda County, are
watching the painters' strike in San Fran
cisco with the keenest interest. One of
the union members stated yesterday that
if the San Francisco painters win their
fight the Alameda County painters will
make similar demands upon the master
painters across the bay. They will de
mand $3 for eight hours' work and a rec
ognition of the union and the working
card system. The painter said:
j We would bave been into tins fight before, j
but we were not in a position to give the
bosses a battle, and will not be until the San
Francisco painters' fight is won. The reasons
are these: Our Alameda County unions are
all small organizations compared to those in
San Francisco. If we get into a strike with
our bosses and by any chance the San Fran
cisco painters should lose we would not have
the ghost of a show to win, because our bosses
would fill our places from the ranks of the de
feated. If, however, the big union wins, then
we can go out on a strike because we know
that no one will fill our places until we get
ready to go back to work.
Like the San Francisco painters, we have the
bu ilding trades unions at our back, and they
will go in with us for better treatment. We
will have to do a little preliminary organizing
in Alameda and Berkeley, and either form
painters' unions in those two cities or get the
painters to form branch unions to the Oakland
painters. Then we wilt be ready for business.
We are confident that the San Francisco boys
will go in, and we have done all in our power
to keep the Oakland painters from taking jobs
under San Francisco bosses. When their vic
tory is won we too will line up and compel
our bosses to give us better pay, shorter hours
and treat us fairly as union men.
COOKS AND WAITERS
Form a Union, Taking In All Hotel
and Restaurant Employes.
The Fraternity of Hotel and Restaurant
Employes organized last evening at 1159
Mission street. In reality this is the new
Cooks' and Waiters' Union, but it was de
cided not to draw the lines in the new fra
ternity, but to receive upon an equal foot
ing the dishwashers, pantrymen, porters,
bellboys, clerks, stewards and all. It was
argued that one of the reasons for the
other Cooks' and Waiters' unions failing
was because none but actual coo ks and
waiters were admitted. Under such cir
cumstances it frequently happened that in
the case of trouble with the employers the
strikers' places were hlled from the pantry
force, the elevator boys, and even the
dishwashers' department.
At the meeting last night thirty-six men
were in attendance. Thomas Beresford
was selected as chairman and Leon Brown
secretary. The chairman called attention
to the fact that individual unions cannot
succeed by themselves. The experiment has
been tried too often and proved to be a fail
ure. Now is the time, he said, for an
other effort, based upon different prin
ciples. Thero is now a general labor
movement alive in the land, and xhose
who earn their living in hotels and res
taurants should be in it. By affiliating
with the central body of labor unions
their rights can be preserved, for they will
have the support of all branches of trade.
J. H. Lukschwitz of Sydney, Australia,
told of the strength of the union in that
city, and said that the fraternity there is
not only a strong organization, but it has
its own employment bureau and club
house.
It was decided to meet again in the same
hall on the 24th inst.
A NEW TRADES UNION.
Italian, French and Spanish Car-
penters to Organize Thurs
day Nltfht.
On Thursday evening one of the strongest
Jabor unions in the City will be organized
in Apollo Hall, on Pacific street, and its
strength and support will be immediately
lent to the Building and Trades Council.
The new union will be the Italian, French
and Spanish branch of the Brotherhood of
Carpenters and Joiners of America, and it
is expected that the union will start off 200
strong. In the four carpenters' unions of
this City there are a number of members
of foreign birth. The proposition to form
them and their brothers in the trade into a
union was made several months ago and
its advocates have been increasing steadily
ever since.
One of the principal leaders in the move
ment is E. Picasso, a contractor. The work
of organization will be done by C. F.
Schadt, the business agent of the car
penters' unions, District Organizer Mals
bary being absent in the country this
week. After organizing the new union
will immediately send its delegates to the
Boiiding Trades Council. The majority
of those who will be members have never
been connected with any labor union be
fore.
The Plasterers' Union.
At the regular meeting of the Plaster
ers' Union last evening the strike of the
painters was indorsed and all the support
jhat the union was able to give was prom
ised. Messrs. Bailey and Handley were
appointed as delegates to the Building
Trades' Council vice Messrs. Finger ana
Miirray, who are eoing to the country.
Several physicians and druggists offered
their services and medicines to the
members of the union at greatly reduced
rates. The offers were accepted. Several
similar propositions are still under consid
eration.
The Lathers' Cases.
To-day the cases of the three striking
lathers who were arrested for assaulitng
young Trade and his companions on Post
street and old man Mohr on Fourth street
will come up in Police Judge Low's court.
The following card has been issued to all
members of tue Lathers' Union:
All union lathers who have nothing else to
do are requested to lend their presence at
Judge Low's court to-morrow mornine, a.s
three lathers will be examined on charges of
assault to murder. C. J. Gkeenwalt,
Secretary Lathers' Union.
J. D. EEDDING IN TOWN.
The Man Who Did Not Break the Bank
at Monte Carlo.
Joseph D. Redding of New York was an
unexpected but welcome guest at the Bo
hemian Club last evening. He came on
the train arriving at 9 p.m., and was cor
dially greeted by many oldtime friends.
Mr. Redding formerly resided in Califor
nia and practiced law in San Francisco.
In fact he is a Native Son of the Golden
West, as he waa born in Sacramento before
tile flood.
Mr. Redding recently returned to Amer
ica after a prolonged journey throughout
Europe. He visited Colonel Alex G.
Hawes in London, George Hall in Paris
and Neally Sullivan in Italy. The story
that Mr. Redding compared his own sys
tem of play at Monte Carlo with the bank
system, and acknowledged that the system
of the bank was the better, is discredited
by the traveler himself.
He says he visited the famous gambling
resort, bot that tha players stood ten deep
at the tables, so that it was almost impos
sible for one to get an opportunity to play.
Many of the visitors were Americans, who
seemed to have plenty of money to spend.
As for himself he did manage, by reaching
over the heads of others, to place a louis,
which won, and George Hall recovered the
winning.
In London Mr. Redding and Colonel
Hawes dined at the Savage Club and sev
eral bohemian resorts. George Hall, the
Turkish Consul in San Francisco, was last
seen in the south of France, where wines
of rare vintage were engaging his atten
tion.
Mr. Redding will remain in San Fran
cisco for three weeks, and perhaps partici
pate in the inaugural ceremonies of the
next president of the Bohemian Club land
the nextpresident of the San Francisco Art
Association.
Incidentally Mr. Redding has filled both
positions, and ought to knoiir a good suc
cessor when he sees one in action.
â¢â¢The Call's" Auction List.
The Call's advertising column devoted to
announcements of sales by auction is becom
ing a notable feature among all classes. IÂ« it
to-day will be found several. important cards
heralding sales of realty and other property.
The desirable features of the property to be
put up are attractively displayed and cannot
fail to' strike the eye and appeal favorably to
the judgment of would-be purchasers.
Fire in Chinatown.
An alarm was sounded through box 17 last
evening at 7:45 o'clock for a fire In a three
story frame buildinc at 1010 Dupont street.
The building is occupied by Chinese families
as a tenement-house. An overturned lamp
was the cause of the fire. The loss will amount
to about $1000.
HOG RANCHES MAY GO

COMMITTEE REPORT REJECTED.
Bay View Property-Owners Making
Progress Against the Foul
Pigpens.
The Board of Health and those Supervi
sors who are opposed to allowing the hoÂ»
ranches in the Bay View district remain
ins in their present location scored a
victory at the meeting of the board yester
day when the report of the Health and
Police Committee, recommending that
action in the matter be suspended for six
months, was rejected.
The residents of Bay View began agitat
ing the removal of the offensive nogpena
and inclosures several weeks ago, and en
listed the aid of the Board of Health
when health inspectors had visited the
section and reported that the ranches were
a menace to the public health from their
lack of cleanliness and the overpowering
odors that arose from them.
Then a petition, indorsed by the Board
of Health, was sent to the Board of Super
visors, asking that the ranchers be com
pelled to remove to other localities where
their animals would not be in such
proximity to human habitations, and the
petition was referred to the Health and
Police Committee.
Both sides were heard by the committee,
the ranchers being represented by two at
torneys, who argued that experience had
shown that the ranches were not detri
mental to the health of those living in the
neighborhood where they are located, and
that it would be a great hardship to com
pel them to move to remote districts
where they would be compelled to send
their hogs long distances to the market.
Supervisors King, Dur^ker and Morgan
stern of the committee were in favor of
postponing action on the matter for at
least six months, while Supervisors Di
mond and Benjamin thought that the
matter was of grave import and that the
wishes of the property-owners, hundreds
of whom signed the petition, should be re
spected and the ranches ordered removed
to other localities. The majority pre
vailed, and ihe recommendation of the
committee was for a postponement of ac
tion.
When the matter came up yesterday Su
pervisor Taylor moved that the report be
rejected on the ground that the reports of
the Health Department had clearly shown
the ranches to be a nuisance and that the
board should not put itself on record as
hindering the progress of such a promising
section as Bay View. The motion was
adopted after it had been amended to pro
vide that the Mayor shall appoint a com
mittee of three Supervisors to visit Bay
Vie /r and personally inspect the ranches,
with a view to guiding the board in its
future deliberations on the subject.
The report of the joint Street and Judi
ciary Committee, recommending that the
City Surveyor be authorized to survey and
establish grades in the section south of
Golden Gate Park, was approved by the
board by a vote of eleven, Supervisor Tay
lor asking to be excused.

ON THE VERGE
OF A DECISION
Labors of the Council Ex
pected to Conclude
To-Day.
BROWN'S JUDGES SILENT
Not Improbable That the Ac
cused Man Will Be Fully
Exonerated.
THE PASTOR SEEMS ANXIOUS.
Dr. Williams Visits Him at a Late
Hour, Evidently With Cheering
News.
The Brown council was in almost con
tinuous session from 2 o'clock yesterday
afternoon until 11 last night, without
reaching a verdict which they were willing
should go to the world as an expression of
their three days' deliberations.
If they reached a conclusion at all the
individual members were loth to give it
out, presumably preferring to sleep over
the decision before relieving the suspense
of those most directly interested.
When the ecclesiastical judges made
their exit on the Mason-street side last
night every man was in a great rush to
catch a car or anything that would take
him out of the reach of reporters.
Dr. Pond, Rev. Mr. Rader and Layman
Ruthraff were the only members who took
things leisurely. The}' sauntered down
the street apparently oblivious of news
paper men or anything else, except the
consciousness of the secret hugged so
closely to their breasts.
"Is it true that the council reached" a
verdict of unministerial conduct?" was
asked of Dr. Pond.
"I decline to answer," was the laconic
reply.
â¢Will you say, then, if the council has
ended its deliberations?" was then ven
tured.
"I decline to answer that also," the rev
erend gentleman replied.
Dr. Pond volunteered the information
that, as the "boss whitewasher" of the
Pacific Coast, certainly no very severe ver
dict could be expected from him.
Piev. Mr. Rader and Layman Rnthraff
were equally as uncommunicative as their
brother judge. They refused to indicate
in any way the final findings if such a
hin g had occurred in the council.
During the evening, and in fact until the
council adjourned, .Pastor Brown walked
np and down Geary street from Mason to
Powell. Every ten or fifteen minutes his
friend and adviser, Deacon Morse, came
hurriedly up to the church, and with
much eagerness a?ked if there was any
thing new or if a verdict had been ren
dered.
One thing, at least, is sure, if the council
did not reach a decision last night they
came very near the point. A committee
was appointed, with Dr. Williams as chair
man, to suitably draft the verdict of the
council and present it to the church.
Dr. McLean when asked last night if a
verdict had been rendered said: "We have
not yet concluded our labors although we
have almost arrived at a derision. When
we parted to-night we pledged ourselves
not to divulge anything that had taken
place, so I am not at liberty to say one
word. I think we shall finish to-morrow
afternoon."
From another source later in the evening
it was learned that the verdict will be
'pruiltyof non-ministerial conduct/ quali
lied in such a way as to admit of Dr.
Brown's continuing in the ministry.
During the afternoon Dr. Pond made a
long argument favoring a mild judgment
and incidentally arraigning the women
who had appeared against Dr. Brown.
His speech was not very favorably re
ceived, though listened to with respectful
attention. Mr. Dodge made a spirited re
ply, in which he said that this was not an
occasion where leniency could be exercised.
The sudden departure of Miss Overman
occupied some little time of the council,
though it was finally determined not to al
low this even to prejudice their verdict,
provided Dr. Brown made a proper and
plausible explanation.
The moderator. Dr. McLean, consumed
a big portion of the evening in giving a
blackboard demonstration of the different
handwritings submitted to the council.
This was confined largely to comparisons
of Miss Overman's writing with that of the
anonymous letters received by Mrs. Cooper
and others.
Dr. McLean has expressed the opinion
that the letters offered in evidence by Dr.
Brown as samples of those written to Miss
Overman while that young lady was in Ta
coma were written to order. On January
7 Dr. Brown only had one of these letters.
The moderator is correspondingly skepti
cal and cannot see why a man at home
would call a woman Mattie and then in a
letter address her as "Miss Martha."
The council will meet this morning at 10
o'clock.
The committee on findings will meet
this morning at 10 o'clock, for the purpose
of putting in shape the opinion of the coun
cil. That body proper will meet at 1
o'clock to receive the report and make such
additions as the members might suggest.
This verdict will not be given out until
Wednesday night.
The committee is made up of Dr, Wil
liams (chairmar.), Mr. Curtis, Dr. Hoyt,
Rev. Mr. Rader and Dr. McLean.
Immediately after ttie adjournment of
the committee last night Dr. Williams vis
ited Dr. Brown at his home, 1703 Geary
street. As Dr. Williams is a substantial
friend of the accused pastor, this midnight
visit is significant if nothing more.
IN OLD MEXICO.
A Charming Spot Where Skies and
Soa Are Calm All the
Summer.
Mrs. Tunnel! and her dear young frie nd
Mattie Overman displayed rare jiuigment
when they chose the seaside town of Ense
nada in the Mexican province of Baja Cal
ifornia as a quiet place where they might
rest until the close of the Davidson trial.
Tbe bay of Todos Santos is almost a
perfect crescent, edged with gray sands and
white foam, about a mile long. On each
horn of the crescent is a high point of
land â that on the south being known as
the Punta Banda. Under the lee ot the
point on the north and the bare hills that
back it stand the Hotel Iturbide and the
simple little Mexican custom-house and
town. In the town is a barracks where
about fifty dark-skinned Mexican soldiers
are housed-. They are uniformed in the
summer-time in white and straw hats, and
tire more reminiscent of picnics than of
war.
An American hotel, second class, keeps
open doors for modest tourists at $25 per
month, while the "high-toned" English
visitors, of whom there are many, sit on
the piazzas of the Iturbide and dreamily
contemplate the drowsy sea, for the ocean
in that vicinity is as quiet as a sleeping
babe.
Tliere is a restaurant in the place where
one may dine on the fattest of chickens,
with Spanish olives, French pates, French
wines, real Havana and Mexican cigars.
An excellent Mexican band gives open-air
concerts and also plays at banquets in the
restaurant, the most favorite Spanish aira
being 'Los Kisos Cabellos," "Sobre Las
Olas," "Dime Mujer," "Un Beso," "La
I'aloma" and others that make the feet
tingle for the dance.
There is no doubt that when that band
gets to playing some of its lively music
lister Overman and Mother Tunnell will
be sorely tempted to v.'altz to the seduc
tive music.
In this quaint town, away from the
clatter of Christian gossip and solaced by
the daily reading of the Scriptures, it is
expected that the roses will bloom again
in the now sallow cheeks of the strawberry
haired Mattie, and that that pious matron,
Mrs. Tunnell, the mother confessor of the
fair Mattie, will await in j>eace the second
coming, in which doctrine she is so ardent
a believer.
Some surprise has been manifested that
Matiie and her aged friend did not hie to
Tacoma, where is Matties home, and
to lives her sister, who, according to
Matties evidence, supplied her with
money. It would not cost her so much to live
up there, and besides that she would be in
the bosom of her family. The story that she
went to Ensenada foir the purpose of in-

ducing Mrs. Tunnell to make an affidavit
exonerating Dr. Brown is not generally
believed. Such an affidavit would be prac
tically worthless, because Mrs. Tunnell
could depose to whatever points she
pleased and there would be no opportunity
of cross-examining her.
Her statement would have but little
effect upon public opinion, because she
has already denied that she received
money from Dr. Brown since she has been
away from San Francisco and afterward
aknowledged that she received money,
but was not aware of the source whence it
came.
A strong impression prevails in certain
quarters that Mrs, Tunnell knew all about
the plot entered into by Mattie to black
mail Dr. Brown, but that she piously
looked upon the matter as a plan to bring
Dr. Brown to his duty as a minister and as
MattLe's most admired friend. Others be
lieve that Mrs. Jane Elizabeth Baddin,the
landlady spoken of as having had ocular
keyhole demonstration of the doctor's al
leged indiscretion with Mattie, is simply a
lay figure for Mrs. Tunnell.
There is no doubt that the old lady is the
keystone of the case. Her sudden flight
from this City after having had a confer
ence with Dr. Brown and Miss Overman,
and the fact that these two supplied her
with money after she left, have given rise
to the most damaging suspicions against
the Rev. Charles Oliver Brown.
The Grand Jury has as yet made no in
quiry into Miss Overman's culpability in
the blackmail scheme as revealed by her
setf before the church council under the
most solemn of oaths. Nothing will be
done until after the church council shall
have rendered its decision in the Brown
case. When that shall have been done the
Grand Jury will take a hand.
District Attorney Barnes said yesterday
afternoon that after the conclusion of the
Brown eccksias-tic trial Mattie Overznan's
case will be properly presented before the
Grand JuryÂ« He expects that the ecclesi
astical council will prepare findings, and
this will expedite the work of the Grand
Jury very materially, the evidence before
the council being of the most voluminous
character and lumbered up with much ir
relevant matter.
Miss Overman, he said, was under sub
pena in the Davidson case for the defense,
and if she does not appear when called she
will be guilty of contempt of court. If
she should be indicted for felony by the
Grand Jury extradition papers will be ap
plied for and she and Mrs. Tunnell will be
Drought back from Mexico or wherever
else they may be.
Misa Overman's absence is favorable for
Mrs. Davidson's case. She is the most im
portant witness for the prosecution and
should she and Mrs. Tunnell remain away
it will only be a matter of Dr. Brown's
word against that of Mrs. Davidson.
Should Miss Overman be indicted she will
have to stick to the story she told the ec
clesiastical council, otherwise her testi
mony will be rejected by the jury as false.
Taking all these fact* into consideration
it is believed that the pious pair will re
main in hiding somewhere in Mexico until
the Davidson matter is settled at least.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 17, 1896.
WRECK OF THE
MATTIE T. DYER.
Terrible Sufferings Endured
by the Captain and
Crew.
NO WATER TOR 8 DAYS.
All the Provisions Consisted of
Twenty-four Cans of
Fruit.
JUST A CAN FOR EACH MAN.
The Last Boat Was Picked Up by a
Steamer Sent Out to Search
for Them.
The United States gunboat Bennington
arrived from Honolulu yesterday with tne
entire crew of the wrecked sealing
schooner Mattie T. Dyer aboard. The
story of the disaster reads like a romance.
The night was clear and bright although
there was no moon. The vessel was un
der full sail and an observation having
been taken the day before the captain and
crew thought everything was plain sail
ing. Captain Mockier had sailed the same
course for years when on his way to the
Japanese coast in search of seals. â¢
The watch was about to go below and
the master was on deck to see how things
were going. Seven bells had just been
Bounded and the reverberation had hardly
died away when the Dyer struck. The
sails were thrown aback and for a few
minutes all was confusion. The schooner
lifted with the next swell and then settled
on a blind rock. Order was soon restored
and the men began launching the boats.
The first one put over the side was all
provisioned but unfortunately was dashed
to pieces on the schooner's quarter. Two
other boats met the same fate, and then"
all attempt to save anything was given up
and the crew embarked in the lour re
maining boats. A few minutes later the
Mattie T. Dyer turned over and went
down bodily.
One of the boats was short of sail, and
Alonzo Perkins, the carpenter, went back
to secure a jibsheet. While he was aboard
the schooner heeled over, and ho had to
jump overboard in order to save his life.
When daylight broke Captain Mockier
made an inspection ot the boats, and
found that all hands had been saved.
Two compasses had been secured, the sec
ond one having been torn from the bin
nacle and thrown into the boat a few min
utes before the schooner went down. There
was no water and only a case of canned
fruit which one of the sailors had rescued
at the last moment. The first thing Cap
tain Mockier did was to distribute the men
evenly in the boats. He took command of
one, and had with him Second Mate W.
Spear, P. Pederson, hunter, and Chris
Olson, F. Peterson and V. Madison, sailors.
The second boat was commanded by
First Mate Hugh Walker, and be had with
him N. S. Waldell, the steward, and Mor
ris Madelin, C. Sinclair, J. Jensen and
John Nelson.
The third boat was placed in command
of J. F. Jackson, one of the hunters, and
he had with him Alonzo Perkins and W.
Lindquist, hunters, and C. J. Berry, B.
Donnelly and James Mitchell, sailors.
The fourth boat had only five in it, and
Ed Larsen, hunter, was placed in com
mand. He had with him Frank Moore, J.
Watson and J. Huyden, sailors, and M. A.
Lundgren, cabin bay.
When the distribution had been com
pleted Captain Mockier opened the case of
canned fruit and gave each boat six cans.
Two of the boats were out four days and
four hours beiore reaching livid; the third
was out seven days and six nights, and the
fourth was out eight days and seven nights
before land was reached or help came.
One canâ and a two-pound can at thatâ
was the daily allowance for all six men.
If it were peaches, each sailor was given
half of one in the morning and a small
quantity of the liquid. Midday and even
ing his allowance was the same, so it can
be imagined how the men who were out
eight days suffered. It was the same
when it came to apricots, but when the
gooseberries and grapes were opened only
three of each were served out with the
small modicum of liquid allowed.
This was the law laid down by Captain
Mockier, and it was rigidly followed, ex
cept in one instance. This was on the first
evening, when the Bkipper opened a can of
apricots and explained to the men that
land was 500 miles away, and that starva
tion diet must rule. Each man was given
his allowance and then the can was stowed
away. Next morning it was gone, and no
one knew anything about its disappear
ance.
After leaving the schooner all the boats
made for the nearest point of land. This
was a rock almost covered and encircled
by land. After landing they dug every
where for water, but like the ancient mar
iner they found "Water, water everywhere,
but not a drop to drink." A number of
goonies (a member of the albatross family)
were captured and distributed among the
boats, but only the ones that were longest
in making land made any use of their liv
ing cargo. Even in these instances the
flesh was not used, and a meal was made
of the blood.
Some trouble was experienced in getting
away from the rock and one of the boats
was almost swamped. Once clear it was
plain sailing. The men suffered horribly,
however. Some of them were only half
dressed and all of them had been drenched
by the waveÃ. The sun beat down furiously
and the sea reflected it back again. Dur
ing the day they were baked almost to a
cinder, and at night the wind and sea
would get up together and the men would
get soaked through and through. Their
hands and feet swelled to frightful propor
tions and many of the men attempted to
jump overboard in order to end their suf
ferings.
Three of the boats landed at the island of
Niibsn, but a steamer had to be sent after
the fourth, which wasin command in J. F.
Jackson. The Keau Hou was placed at
the disposal of Captain Mockler, and he
found tue men when they had given up
all hope and were almost dead from
hunger and tnirt. They were all delirious
and begged and prayed for water. Their
mouths were washed out and only a lew
drops at a time were given them. When
satisfied a little broth was made and fed to
them, and in this manner they were gradu
ally brought back to life and reason.
The men who were in charge of the four
boats were seen yesterday, and all had
thrilling stories to "tell. "When I took my
last observation on February 21," said
Captain Mockler, "we were in latitude 36
deg. 10 mm. north, longitude 166
deg. 20 mm. west. 1 thought that
we were clear of all danger, but the
current carried us down during the night
and we went on the French Frigate shoals.
During the four days and four nights we
were out the men suffered a great deal,
but we all took our medicine, and when
we landed on the beach at Niihau we still
had two cans of apricots left. Our boats
went to pieces almost before we got ashore,
and Mate Walker, who brought his boat in
at the same time as mine, narrowly es
caped with his life.
11 After getting ashore we began pros
pecting for provisions. "We found a native i
who was on a fishing expedition, and he
agreed to take me back to his camp. He
had a horse, and both of us got on it and
rode ten miles into the interior. When we
reached the Kanaka camp they advised
me to go five miles further and see the
manager oi the station.
"I got a fresh horse, and I'll tell you in
confidence that that extra five-mile ride
was worse than starving in an open boat.
I was simply flayed alive.
"When I reached headquarters there
were eggs, butter and milk in abundadcc,
but all I got was a look at them. Manager
Moore kindly gave me a sheep, and after
waiting a few minutes I said: 'Couldn't
you please let me have a little coffee?'
'Certainly, certainly,' he answered, and
handed out two small packages. I waited
a minute or so longer and said sugar would
go well with the coffee. 'Oh, certainly,
certainly,' he answered again, and handed
me out some sugar. Then feeling thor
oughly ashamed of myself, I said, 'A little
salt would go well with the mutton.' 'Oh,
certainly, certainly,' said Moore, and
handed out the salt. Then I rode back to
the Hawaiian camp.
"What a difference there was in the re
ception. The natives had all gathered and
made a collection. There, were clothing,
shoes, food and everything they thought
we might need. They had horses ready
and they came down in a body to the
beach and did everything possible lor my
crew. When the third boat came in they
took hold of the almost famished crew and
fed them on poi diluted with milk, which
they rode ten miles to get. 1 can never
forget the natives of Niihau.
"From that point we went to Waimea in
a whaleboat, and when we explained that
two of our boats were still missing Captain
Thompson of the Ke Au Hou at once
stopped taking cargo and started out to
look for them. Larsen's boat, we found,
had reached Niihau, but there was no sign
of Jackson's craft. We cruised around all
that night and next day sighted them.
They were lying in the bottom of the boat,
but when we came alongside managed to
get up, and Alonzo Perkins made the boat
fast. When we arrived at Honolulu the
American Consul took charge of us and we
were sent home on the Bennington."
Chief Officer Hugh Walker's story is
similar to that of Captain Mockler's. The'
two boats were in company troughout the
four days and tbe twelve men in them
were not reduced to such straits as the
others.
J. F. Jackson and Alonzo Perkins, who
were in the boat that was out eight days,
say they never had such a fearful experi
ence. Ihe men were only half clothed and
when picked up by the steamer nearly all
of^ them were v mass of blisters and sores.
"In tretting away from the barren rock,"
said Jnckson, "our boat was almost
wrecked. We followed in the wake of the
captain's boat, but she sailed faster than
wedid, and when eighty miles from land
we lust sight of her. Then a gale came
up and we were driven out of our course.
We beat our way back, but another storm
drove us off and we were in despair. Our
last can of peaches had gone two days
previously and we were not only without
food, but perishing for a drink. A rain
storm helped us out, or else I don't think
one of us would evtr have reached Caii
fornia alive. Tne Mattie T. Dyer went
down almost in a moment and Perkins al
most went down with her. When we
reached tbe boat he only had a pair of
underpants on. so you can imagine bow he
must nave suffered in that tropical sun."
Ed Larsen, who wan in command of the
boat that was out seven days and six nights,
only repeats the story of the horrors en
dured while vainly seeking to make land.
The 1 men lost everything, and some of
them landed in San Francisco yesterday
dressed in fclothes giren thenu by the
native Hawaiians.
The Mattie T. Dyer was one of the best
known "ealers sailing out of San. Francisco
ana her entire crew hails from this port.
She was fitted out at an expense of $10,000,
and all the insurance on her was $3000,
placed on the vessel by Mrs. Mockler after
the captain saiied. She was one of the
fastest schooners afloat, and during her
run for Japan hung to the steamer Rio de
Janeiro for four days. When she went on
the reef she was only twenty days out
from San Francisco.
TWO BOONS FOR EUREKA
Beneficial Results of the Freight
Traffic War to That
City.
lOWEE BATES TO PREVAIL.
Shingles Can Now Be Shipped From
Humboldt Bay to Compete With
the Sound.
Within the past few weeks there have
been developments in the transportation
situation on the coast that are bound to
result in giving a decided impetus to the
commercial growth of Eureka and the en
tire section tributary to this metropolis of
Humboldt Bay.
As a side issue of the great traffic war
passenger and freight â between the South
ern Pacific Company and the Oregon Rail
way and Navigation Company for business
between this City and Portland, Or., the
North Pacific Steamship Company, a
third competitor for the freight tariff be
tween the points mentioned, not only cut
its tariff down to $1 a ton, but also invaded
Coos and Humboldt bays with its vessels
â the Alice Blanchard and the Empire.
In retaliation the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company put on tho South
Coast, which took freight at the same rate
to Portland and cut the rate from P?rt
land to Eureka, Cal., to $1, it having been
$3 to that port from San Francisco pre
viously. This resulted in injuring the
trade of the local merchants with Hum
boldt Bay, and the matter having been
called to the attention of the San Fran
cisco Board of Trade, that body called a
special meeting of the local commercial or
ganizations to consider the matter.
A special committee was appointed, con
sisting of A. L. Scott, W. R. Wheeler, T.
J. Parsons and W. B. Curtis, to confer
with Goodall, Perkins & Co., the local gen
eral agents of the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company, in order to arrive at
what would be considered a fair settlement
of the matter. This committee met yes
terday and as the first steps in the adjust
ment of the matter agreed to send the fol
lowing communication to the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company repre
sentatives:
Messrs. Goodall, Perkins & Co. General Agent* Q
R.&N.Co.. Cityâ Gentlemen: At the coher
ence recently held in the rooms of the Board
of Trade by representatives from the following
organizations of this city, the Chamber of
Commerce, Board of Trade. Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association, the Traffic Association,
Merchants' Association and tan Francisco Fruit
Kxchange, at widen you were represented, a
committee was appointed to confer with you
in reference to the discrimination in rates
which your line is maintaining between Porf
land, Or., and north coast ports south of there,
notably Eureka, as against Sin Francisco.
The committee after due deliberation begs
permission to make to you the following re
quest. We contend that San Francisco being
but 216 miles from Eureka as against fr_'O
miles from Portland to Eureka is entitled to
the lower rates. We request, therefore, that
rates from San Francisco to Eureka shall be
adjusted on a mileage basis, San Francisco re
ceivingthe benefit of bergeograpbical position.
In refutation of press reports in both Port
land and Eureka papers we wish to here state
that we have no demand to make, nor was any
demand ever made, that the service between
Portland and Eureka be discontinued. We
would be pleased to hear from you on the
proposition as outlined above at as early a date
as practicable.
It is believed that there will be a prompt
compliance with the request of the com
mittee and that not only will justice be
done tbe merchants of this City, but
Eureka and Humboldt Bay M-ill be given
the benefit of lower rates than heretofore
from San Francisco.
But the most important development so
far as Eureka is concerned has been ac
complished through the Traffic Association
of this City and largely through the per
sonal efforts of Traffic Manager W. B.
Curtis.
Heretofore Eureka has always been
placed at a great disadvantage as against
the Puget Sound country in the business
of supplying shingles to tbe East, because
it was not located on a transcontinental
line, and did not enjoy the privilege of a
terminal rate. The matter was taken up by
the Traffic Association and the result is
best told in the following telegram sent on
trie 13th inst. to Secretary IX K. B. Sel
lers of thp Eureka Chamber of Commerce
by Traffic Manager Curtis:
The Traffic Axxociation of California to the Cham
ber of Commerce of Eurekaâ Greeting: The Cen
tral and Union Pacific railroads have agreed
with us to make from Eureka to the Missouri
River and Chicago the same rates per 100
pounds on shingles, carloads, as is made from
i'uget Sound to the same destination, and
those railroads will piy the charges from
Eureka to San Francisco, provided that the
charge is not more than f 1 50 per ton weight
on board cars at San Francisco. The steamers
North Fork, Alice Blanchard or Empire will
take at that rate, or you can ship by any vessel
that will carry for that figure and deliver at
Mission Bay or Oakland wharf on board cars-
The importance of this may be gathered
from the fact that last year there was
shipped East from Puget Sound 8000 ear
loaUs of shingles as against 80 carloads
from Eureka. Thia concession will not in
any way interfere with the business of
those Who ship shingles East from San
Francisco, as nearly all such firms are the
owners of mills in Humboldt county.
Later it is hoped to obtain a similar con
cession on lumber.
KICKED A WOMAN.
John Itrignoli, a Plumber, May Have
to Answer a Charge of Man-
slaughter*
John Brignoli, a plumber, living at 322
Chestnut street, finds himself in a serious
predicament. He was at a Foresters' ball
in Union-square Hall on Saturday night,
and about 1 o'clock Sunday morning he
got into a fight. One of the objects of his
wrath was Mrs. J. Thompson of 12 Tehama
street, and it is now charged that he
kicked her in the abdomen.
Brignoli was arrested for disturbing the
peace, and on Sunday he was released on
baii. Yesterday morning, when his case
was called in Judge Joachirasen's court
he failed to appear and a bench warrant
was issued for his arrest.
Lady friends of Mrs.. Thompson were in
court and they told the Judge that she
was in a precarious condition as the result
of her injury, as she was in a delicate state
of health.
The Judge at once raised Brignoli's bail
to $5000. He was arrested and will be held
pending the lesult of Mra. Thompsou's in
jury.
The Southern Pacific Case.
Counsel for the State will open the argument
in the caae of the Southern Pacific Company
against the Railroad Commissioners in Judge
McKeana's court this morning.
NEED NOT BREAKDOWN.
Many Men and Women Do When It Is
Entirely Needless.
"It is almost impossible to find persons in
the ordinary walks of active life who are not
suffering, more or less, from want of vital
force."
It was a learned professor connected with a
New York medical college who recently made
this remark: "Men break down under the
strains of high-pressure living," he continued,
"they overwork the brain and neglect the
body. They exercise no part of the body ex
cept the head, and consequently suffer from
indigestion, palpitation of the heart, weak
nerves and other ills that make life a burden."
That the above words are absolutely true is
repeatedly proved by the experience of many
men who break down through overwork and
too closÂ« attenton to business. They overtax
the nervous system, they strain their physical
powers to the point of exhaustion and then
have to sjive up the light. This was exactly
what happened in the case of Selden Fish, the
well-known Chicago lawyer, as will be seen by
the following statement that he recently
made: "I was not diseased," said Mr. Fish, "Dut
simply prostrated at my nerve centers by too
close application to business. By the use of
Duffy's pure malt whisky, however, I was com
pletely restored to health. I think that this
whisky is nature's great remedy for almost
any weakening or wasting disease."
Thousands of people have passed through the
same exprience. When broken down and" worn
out in health they have discovered that the
only way to regain their lost vigor is by the
use of a pure stimulant. They have found out
that the best thing for this purpose is Duffy's
pure malt whisky, which is unexcelled for its
great restorative powers. No other prepara
tion can be relied on to work its wonderful
curative effects. Do not let your druggist or
grocer attempt to sell you anything that is
claimed to be "cheaper" or "just as good."

The Buckleyites Are Sending
Out Doves Amid the Roar
of Battle.
RAINEY AND BUCKLEY FOR IT
Both Sides Talk War and Purity and
Begin Whisperings of Com
promise.
The Democratic local situation as it pre
sented itself yesterday was one of bitter
and uncompromising war between the
Buckley and the Junta factions, with talk
of compromise already reaching the inde
pendent observers' ears above the roar of
battle.
The Democratic State Central Commit
tee, after a comparatively brief session last
Sahirday afternoon and evening, at which
Gavin McNab and his friends held nearly
all of the thirty-seven proxies, at
which the chairman ruled and foueht
uniformly for the Junta and at which a
majority of the members present were
controlled, through Mint, gubernatorial
or internal revenue office patronage, in
favor of the McNab element, adopted a
resolution directing the chairman and
secretary of the State Central Committee
to issue the call for the State convention
to the Junta Democratic organization in
San Francisco.
This official recognition is expected by
the Junta to give it prestige in the local
campaign preceding the State conven
tion, ana also to give it prestige before the
State convention when rival delegations
knock for admission. The Junta expects
besides that, by virtue of this action, its
delegation will be put on the temporary
roll, and have a vote in the selection of a
temporary chairman and the committee
on credentials.
If the Junta delegation is thus recog
nized at the opening of the convention the
Buctley contesting delegation will have
the worst of it a? far as the action of. the
chairman and the committee on creden
tials are concerned. That is a big advan
tage, but beyond that the two delegations
would have an even show, if. indeed, the
Buckley delegation did not have the best
of it, through the showing of superior
numbers â a party consideration which a
State convention is not apt to ignore.
But the State convention is quite a dis
tance in tbe future, and i veTy great num
ber of things may h ppen in San Francisco
Democratic politics Letween now and June
16, when the conveutioa will meet at Sac
ramento.
As things now stand the local Demo
cratic party is divided into three elements
â those who support the Buckiey side and
its claims to bring the "regular" organiza
tion; those who stand by the Junta, and
those who have no use for either side be
cause they know that Buckley controls one
organization and that Rainey controls the
other, and that a vote or a word for either
eide is equally a vote, or a word in support
of bossism.
The light as it has developed so far is a
fight of Buckley against Kainey. The
only occasion for such a strange fight is
that Rainey has not yet secured what he
considers his just terms on a division of
spoils.
That Sam Rainey controls the Junta in
conjunction with John Dagpett, Superin
tendent of the Mint, is not denied in pri
vate conversation by any of the leading
members of the Junta, and it is de
nied onJy for publication by Gavin 3dc-
JÂ» T ab and Chairman W. P. Sullivan
â¢when tney are being interviewed. The
only doubt held by those conversant with
the political affairs of tne Junta concern
ing the policy aud the future of the organ
ization has concerned Ed Lanigan, who
controls between forty and fifty votes in
the Junta's new generalcomniitt.ee. 'With
Laniean on Rainev's side, the control of
the Junta's general committee is conceded
to be settled.
The next few days will develop some
thing definite concerning the possibility of
a compromise between the factions on a
general open primary or other proposition.
Tne Buckleyites are now as anxious as
they have been for some time to reach an
agreement regarding a primary election at
vrnich they will get at least half the
election officers. As far as definite indica
tions go the Buckleyites will proceed to
hold a primary election at which they will
muster the biggest voting strength they
are capable of, while the Junta managers
seem inclined to avoid a primary and to
appoint delegates to the State convention.
The Bnckleyites propose to hold a meet
ing of their general committee next
Thursday, at which resolutions will be
adopted expressing their indignation at
the rulings and course of Chairman Gould
at the Saturday meeting of the (State Cen
tral Committee, their opinion of the State
Central Committee in general and their
determination to go ahead as the regular
local party organization.
In the meantime, amid the talk of. war,
compromise propositions are being heard.
THE PASTOR AND THE LADY.
Mrs. Prescott Says Rev. Mr. El
lis' Charges Against Her Are
. Ridiculous.
She Denies Coaching Little Girls
Tell Infamous Stories About
an Old Man.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cat.l, )
90S Broad way, March 16. f
Mrs. Prescott, secretary of the Humane
Society, is very angry with Rev. John
W. Ellis, pastor of the Centennial Presby
terian Church, who has appeared as the
champion of William Clark, the old East
Oakland man who is charged with im
proper conduct toward three little girls.
The pastor went to the District Attorney
and asked for the testimony, and- while
reading it suggested to Deputy District
Attorney Melvin that the little ones had
been coached by Mrs. Prescott or they
never could have toJd such stories. Said
Mrs. Prescott yesterday:
llHis charges are ridiculously false, for as a
matter of fact I never talked with the children
alone in my life. I saw them once, and then
In the presence of Chief Lloyd and District
Attorney Melvin. Thai was on the morning
after Clark's arrest. The offlc ers thbught that
perhaps the children would more freely tell
their stories if their parents were not in the
room, so they sent for me to be present. The
children were brought in one at a time, and
they told the same story then that they told
afterward on the witness-stand.
The only thing that I ever said to them in
regard to their testimony was to try to im
press upon their minds the necessity of the
truth and nothing more. 1 told them that
what they said might send the man to prison
and I adfised them to be very careful. That is
the extent of the "coaching" x did, if coach
ing it is. I would not dare to attempt to tell a
child what to 6ay (should I so desire, which I
do not), for I appreciate that under cross-ex
amination they would impeach their testi
mony within five minutes.
Mr". Ellis came to my office about a week ago
and seemed to be trying to honestly get at the
facts, so I helped him all I could. He asked
ms if I did not think it a case of persecution
and I told him I did not, as I consider the
stories of the three children overwhelming.
That was the only time I ever spoke with the
man and I know nothing about him.
Rev. J. W. Ellis is the minister who was
the center of many charges of misconduct
and unministerial conduct in San Fran
cisco about four years ago.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. MARCH 17, 181)6.
FAVORITES LEO THE WAY
Five Out of Six Favorites at
Ingleside Won Very
Easily.
REV DEL TIESRA IN FRONT.
The Handicap Proved a Gift for Tom
Griffin's Good Colt Sir
Vassar.
Them were no extraordinary features
about the racing at Ingleside yesterday.
Five out of six favorites sauntered past
the wire in the easiest possible fashion,
and a feeling of distrust prevailed in the
neighborhood of the combination book.
The card was only a fair one, yet the at
tendance was quite up to the average.
The downpour of rain left the track
heavy, but not sloppy. IS ever did the ex
cellent drainage system show to better ad
vantage than on this occasion.
The two-year-old division opened the
racing. Eight youngsters started in a
four-furlong scramble with Rey del Tierra
ruling a9to 10 favorite. The brother to
Rey Alfonso ran into the lead when
straightened away in the stretch and won
easily with Ingleside at 40 to 1 finishing
in the place.

The redoubtable William Pinkerton
struck easy company indeed in the race
following.a five-furlong dash. He was in
with some cheap selling-platers and the
ring held him at Ito 5. He ran over the
top of his field, passing the wire first under
a pull, two lengths before Last Chance.
But four started in the seven-furlong
handicap, which terminated in the proces
sional order. Tom Griffin's good colt Sir
Vassar, in at ninety-eight pounds, was a
13 to 10 choice, and, leading from start to
finish, won in a gallop from Wyoming, the
second choice. Kowaisky finished in the
show.
The mile and a quarter selling event
proved a windfall for McXaugnton &
Muir's uncertain quality, the hooded
Basso. The Falsetto horse was a 3to 5
favorite with Garner up, and sent to the
front after passing the stand, won as he
pleased from Oakland in the slow time of
2:14)4, with Foremost in the show.
The only upset of tbe day occurred in
the race that foJlowed, the mile-selling
affair. Pittsburg Phil's "left over" racer,
Ed Kearney, commanded first call in the
betting, and at no time daring the running
looked like the money. Service, the 13 to
5 second choice, with Shields up, made a
runaway race of it, winning in a common
canter from Collins with the favorite third.
Dan Honig's fast mare, Charm, fell heir
to a very easy purse in the last event of
the day, a six-furlong spin. Starting a 3
to 5 chance in the betting, she led her field
from the jump, winning under restraint a
length before Boreas. There was quite a
play on Rico, forcing his odds down from
100 to 40 to 1, and be finished third.
Traok and Paddook Items.
Riley Grannan was missed from the bet
ting ring yesterday. The young plunger
is now aboard the cars speeding away to
his old Kentucky home, deeply absorbed
in a bound copy of "Winter Racing, Its
Causes and Effects."
Alex Shields, owner of the old racehorse
Logan, has returned to California from
the East. He brought no horses with him.
Dissatisfied with the way his hor-es
were performing in their races, Mr. Hobart
discharged a number of his stable em
ployes and ordered all of his horses shipped
to his ranch.
Jockey Cash Sloane bid Basso, winner of
the fourth race, up $100 over his entered
selling price of $200.
The gentlemen's race to-day promises io
be quite a society event. The arrange
ments have been in fcbe hands of Thomas
Francis Meagher Jr., and a very pretty
contest is looked forward to. All of the
best gentlemen riders on the coast will be
seen up in the saddle on the diminutive
jumpers. The entries, with their mounts,
are as follows : Conejo, Lieutenant Smed
burg; Galloping Dick, Mr. Bagot; Brandy,
Mr. Hobart; Li Hung Chang, Mr. Hen
shaw; Tripe, Captain Wainriirht; Bar
bara, Mr. McCreery; Alladin, Mr. Simp
kins, ahd Jumping" Jack, Mr. Bennett.
St. Patrick's day at Ingleside track will
be celebrated by the muchly talked of
Shamrock handicap. It will result in a
grand reunion of the Murphy family. The
starters in the handicap are Tim, Pat and
Babe Murphy. Presiding in the stand will
be Mr. Tim Murphy of the "Texas Steer"
company, with Judge Joe Murphy as asso
ciate. "Tom" Murphy will do the starting
and petite Lucille Murphy will present
the green silken sack containing the
purse to the fortunate jockey. The pro
gramme for this special occasion
will be printed on green cardboard,
and that nothing may be lacking genial
Secretary Sam Leake stated that the purse
would be paid in greenbacks. The hills
surrounding the track are now covered by
a velvety mantle of living green, and no
doubt the legal turf advisers will be on the
lookout for green 'uns. It is stated, how
ever, that greengoods men will be barred
from the track. The race is one of the
most catching novelties the management
of the new course has yet given.
FOR OLYMPIC HANDBALL
Members Who Have Subscribed
Liberally to the
Fund.
Eight Hundred of the One Thousand
Dollars Required Has Been
Collected.
At a recent meeting of the directors of
the Olympic Club it was decided that if
the patrons of handball would manifest a
desire to support the directors in a finan
cial way a magnificent handball court, su
perior in every particular to anything of
its kind in America, would coon loom up
on the vacant lot that lies west of the
club's building proper.
Director Short, through whose untiring
efforts this grandest of all indoor pastimes
â handball â has made such wonderful
strides in popularity, said that the patrons
of the game would gladly lend their aid,
provided the directors would not exact too
much from them.
It was then moved and seconded that the
club give $2000 toward the erection of a
court, provided the patrons of the game
raise $1000 cf the $3000 that will be re
quired to complete the structure.
It can be imagined the interest that is
manifested in the pastime when yesterday
Director Short iniormed a representative
of The Call that $800 of the $1000 was
already subscribed.
"1 wish, to inform you," said Mr. Short,
"that the gentlemen who subscribed with
such marked liberality are not generally
members who 'hold down' the courts from
daylight until dark. The largest sums I
received were from new members, who
only occasionally play ball, but who have
become thoroughly infatuated with the
eport.
"You would be surprised if I should give
you the names of some men who refused to
contribute to the fund. I can assure you,
however, that the $1000 necessary will be
forthcoming and that the Olympic Club
will soon be in possession of the handsomest
handball court in the world. Hanoball is
unquestionably the erandest of all athletic
exercises and I predict that within a year
the club will have among its large mem
bership 500 handball enthusiasts."
SOMEBODY TOLD TALES
E. F. Wheeler, a Grocer, Sues
C. S. Capp, the Real
Estate Agent.
He Alleges That His Tenants Were
Induced to Leave by Mali
cious Gossip.
A damage suit for $10,000, based on alle
gations of rather a peculiar nature, will be
tiled in the County Clerk's office this
morning. The plaintiff is E. a". Wheeler,
a grocer who owns considerable real es
tate in the western portion of the city, and
the defendent C. S. Capp, the well-known
Montgomery-street real-estate man.
Wheeler alleges that Capp was his agent
for the collection of the rents of his prop
erty, and that while acting in that, capac
ity he made statements to the tenants,
Mrs. John Kafferty, Mrs. Levy and Mrs.
C. McCarthy, that tne houses were leaking
and not fit for human habitation, which
induced them to leave the buildings, and
that for a long time he was unable to tind
new occupants for the property. He
claims that the statements he attributes
to Capp were without foundation and ma
licious, and that he has been damaged in
the sum named. His attorneys are Barry
& Bianchi.
Mr. Capp was amnsed when informed
last evening that suit was to be brought
against him.
"It will amount to nothing," he said,
"for I never made the statements he cred
its to me, nor gave him any other cause
for action. About a year ago I loaned
Wheeler some money out of kindness, and
to secure the notes he gave me at that
time he assigned me the rents of his prop
erty.
''When the notes became due he owed
me $20 more than their face called for, and
after waiting for some time I sued him and
got a judgment. Previous to the suit and
while I held his assignment of his rents he
went to the tenants and attempted to col
lect the money from them. I had warned
them not to pay him and when he
found that he could get nothing he
gave them notice not to recognize
me as the owner of the rents, as if
they did not pay them he would sue.
Of course, this put them in an annoying
position and they left rather than be an
noyed by him. He. and not I, caused the
people to look for other accommodations.
"The Sheriff sold one piece of Wheeler's
property to satisfy my judgment, and 1
bought it in, but he redeemed it within the
time required. I think the man's mind
must be a little bit clouded or he would
not begin such a suit. He sued me in the
Justice's Court a short time aeo for $200,
alleging that he was damaged in that sum
because I had failed to collect his rents,
but the case was thrown out of court."
ANOTHER GREAT RAFT.
W. K. Baines to Build One of Over
6,000,000 Feet and Bring It to
San Francisco by Sea.
W. E. Baines, the lumberman of Oregon,
who some months since brought the enor
mous Joggins raft to this City, and who
has been here for some time past, will go
north on the next steamer to construct an
other raft. It will then be brought down
the coast by a tug.
Mr. Baines ho^es to fight shy of storms,
and if he does, will make a handsome sum, i
as he did on the last occasion. Just be-]
fore that, however, be lost a raft, and this
set him back to the extent of about $25,
--000. Mr. Baines is convinced now, how
ever, that lie knows how to manage these
ffreat rafts so as to cause the losses to be
light. He has picked up mum valuable
information from former experiences.
"The new raft," he said last night at the
Lick House, "will contain between 6,000,
--000 and 7,000.000 feet of timber, being about
the size of the laet one. It will be built on
the Columbia Kivtr, above Astoria, and
directly and indirectly a great many men
will be employed.
"I am satisfied that this is now the way
to bring timber to San Francisco. It is
practically impossible to bring it here by
rail from Oregon or Washington, and, as a
general thing, it is too costly to bring it
in the old way by ship. The solution of
the matter is found in the rafting of it.
"By this method from $2 50 to $3 on
each thousand feet may be saved over the
old means of bringing it here by water.
1 expect .to have this big raft completed
and landed in San Francisco by June, or
at the latest by July."

.explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top flgnrat
at station indicate maximum temperature for thÂ«
days; those underneath it, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in lnches'and hundredths,
during the past twHve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high' 1 means nigh barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather; "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded and
accompanied by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows"
usually first appear on the Washington coast.
\\ hen the pressure Is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north and
â¢outh along the coast, rain Is probable; but when
the -low" is inclosed with Isobars of marked curva
ture rain south of Oregon is improbable. With >:
"high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and the pressure
falling to the California coast, warmer weather may
be expected in summer and colder weather in win
ter. The reverse of these condition! will produc*
aii opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS,
Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V., March 16.â Speculation
at the Stock Exchange continues j narrow and pro
fessional. Total transactions were 179,700 shares.
There was little news afloat to affect speculation
'outside of the publication of the Northern Pacific
plan of reorganization. Even the effect of this
important announcement was only passing in its
character. This probably can be explained by the
fact that the provisions of the plan are bo far
reaching that the street, quick as it is 10 discount
f utun- events, has been unable to fully grasp the
subject matter. The assessments on the stock,
however, were considered heavy, and some of the
holders of third mortgages were of the opinion that
their interests had been sacrificed for the consols.
The first effect of the publication of the plan was
a decline in the common to I% C and in the pre
ferred to<ll%c. The consols 5s on the other hand
rose from 45y 2 to 49y 2 c. - Northern Pacific issues
were not particularly active in the stock market,
only 13,000 shares - being traded in, but in the
total bond department the dealings In the issues of
the company footed vp 1 517, 000. The general
railway, list presented little of interest. At the
opening the tendency was downward, but after a
moderate reaction the market improved. Tobacco,
whicli has been sold right and left of late, took on
.considerable strength and gradually worked up to
48c. the highest for novae time past.
Sucar opened at 1 14 Vi ex-dividend of 3 per cent,
ro<e to 115y 8 and closed at 114%. General Elec
tric rose to 37^8 and later receded to 36 on realiza
tions.' Leather preferred jumped from 61*4 and
'later yielded to 62. In the last hour of tne busi
ness the marke.t was firm in tone, the strength of
Tobacco and the steadiness of Northern Pacific
preferred having had a good effect. Speculation
left off firm. Asa rule, however, the railways
showed losses of Ws^/i er cent. The gain in the
.industrials ranged from s-Jj to % per cent. Pacific
Muil lost lVs on the day.
- Railway and miscellaneous bonds were irregu
lar. Northern Pacific bonds, except for the thirds
and Montana division sixes, were flrm. These
issues were inclined :to weakness, the reorganiza
tion plan havins been unfavorably construed tn
their cases. Sales were $3,088,000. Northern Pa

CHICAGO 3IARKETS.
CHICAGO, Ili., March 16.â Wheat was still
on the down grade to-day. All through the morn
ing the tone was weak and receipts heavy. The
action of holders in disposing of their property at
every decline showed the growing lack of confi
dence which existed. There was nothing tangible
on which to base hopes of Improvement. Liver
pool cables were weak and lower. Receipts in the
Northwest were large at 54 6 cars against 416 last
Monday and 459 a year ago. Black sea shipments
were large at 3.000,000 bushels. The indications
for anything bin a very moderate decrease in the
visible supply were absent. The statement
stiowed a falling off in stocks of 473,000 bushels
when completed. @
Receipts at Chicazo were 27 cars, and 72,950
bushels were taken from store. Export clearances
amounted to 108,8:25 bushels. The amount of
wheat on ocean passage increased 560.000 bushels
and the Knglish visible supply 34,000 bushels.
The world's shipments for the week, estimating
Ruesia -at 3,000,000 bushels, â¢ amounted to
6,521,000 bushels. Closing continental cables
were irregular; Paris was lower: : Berlin partly
higbei a:;d partly lower, and Antwerp unchanged.
Covering of shorts rallied prices from their weak
est point, but a material loss for the day was noted
at the close. May wheat opened from 62S s@62%c
to 62y->c, declined to 613/i@6l'J/BC. closing at
6-'i/ic bid, %c under : Saturday. Estimated re
ceipt s for to- morrow, 50 cars. '
CORNâ Opened steady: ll jrhter receipts than
exDectedâ 4B4 carsâ and an advance of Vijd at Liv
erpool having a favorable effect on prices, but the
slumpy condition of wheat quickly asserted su
premacy in defining the tone. Withdrawals from
store were 177,028 bushels, and 103,144 bushels
cleared at the seaboard. The visible supply in
creased 836,000 bushels. The amount on ocean
passage decreased 1,680,000 busnels. May corn
opened at 2934.C. declined to MVSsi'i closing at
29V2@295-BC. i. B@i4c8 @i4c unaer Saturday. Estimated
receipts for to-uiorrow, 700 car 3.
OATSâ Were fairly steady at the beginning of
the session and for some little time thereafter, but
they were finally obliged to yield to the heavy feel
ing exuding from wheat. - Receipts were 306 cars
and -^900 bushels were taken from store. The
visible supply increased 182,000 bushels. May
oats closed i/gc under Saturday. Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow 415 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash, 90c; May, 90VÂ£c
Receipts were 43 cars.
PROVISIONSâ A weak hog market was report
ed at the yards this morning and that gave prod
uct an unpromising start. The weakness of wheat
later extended sufficient depression to curb any in
clination to buy that might possibly have been
present. May pork closed 71/2 C lower, May lard 6c
lower, May ribs 6c lower. ;

cattle market opened steady to-day, but later, the
supply exceeding first estimates, became weak and
declined Â«@loc. The arrivals of hogs were larger
than expected and prices were 2i^@sc lower.
There was an active demand.but offerings were too

THE BTOCK MARKET.
The Bodies were the strong stocks yesterday, Bo
die advancing to 38c, Bulwer to 40c and Mono to
16c. There was an active business in Bodie on the
afternoon call. The Comstocks were also stronger
on this call under quiet trading,
The close was still higher, with Bulwer at 44c
and Yellow Jacket at 45c, most of the other stocks
also being firmer.
The advance in Bulwer is attributed to a demand
for stock for the annual election in April. As to

The Court Smiled.
Some years ago, in a suit which turned
on the state of mind of a lady who had
been a member of a sisterhood, the late
Chief Justice, then Mr. Coleridge, was
cross-examining a witness, who gave evi
dence as to the plaintiff's behavior while
an inmate of the sisters' home. Among
other things, it had been deposed that
plaintiff had been guilty of a breach of dis
cipline in eating a certain plate of straw
berries.
Mr. Coleridge â Eating strawberries,
really ?
Witness â Yes, sir; she was eating straw
berries.
Mr. Coleridge â How shocking!
Witness â It was forbidden, sir.
Mr. Coleridge â And did you, madam,
really consider there was any harm in that?
Witness â No, sir, not in itself, any wore
than there was in eating an apple, but you
know, sir, the mischief that came from that.
The court smiled and Mr. Coleridge
seemed to lose the thread of his ideas for
the moment. â Household Words.
â¢â â¦ â â¢
The Japanese are extravagantly fond of
children, and treat them so kindly that
Japan has been called the Children's Para

IN HONOR OF
ERIN'S SAINT
Celebration of the Class of
'96 of St. Mary's
College.
â¢'VINCIT AMOR PATRIiE."
The Gold and Green of Ireland
Wreathed With the Stars
and Stripes.
FESTIVAL AT ST. PATEICK'S.
The Patron Saint Honored With
Oratory, Poetry and
Song.
Oaklakd Officx San Fbanctsco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 16. f
The large exhibition hall of St. Mary's
College never presented a more animated
picture than to-nignt. The ciacs of '96
celebrated the anniversary of St. Patrick
with marked enthusiasm before a large au
dience, which was generous in its appre
ciation of the varied efforts of the students
and of the spirit of the occasion. Over the
platform was the class motto, "Vincit
Amor Patriffi."
The platform was decorated with the
VTA Kill* Orator PetefJ SÂ«r aw. Present '1 " M J K".ely, PÂ» t,
preen and gold flag of Ireland, wreathed
in graceful folds with the Btars and atripes.
On the blackboards around the room were
colored drawings of the students, some of
them grotesque, some picturesque and all
artistic. Every seat was filled when the
president, Rev. Brother Agnon, took his
seat.
P. J. Soracco of Sutter Creek, in his ca
pacity as president of the day, made a
speech of welcome, touching briefly on the
motives for their assembling.
M. St. John Kiely of Grass Valley was
the poet of the day. and his effort was
prettily attuned to the theme, which was
the example of Ireland's patron saint as a
patriot. The whole poem was good, but a
verse here and there was particularly note
worthy, and Mr. Kiely 's effort was loudly
applauded.
Aloysius P. Mallon recited an extract
from Graitan's of Rights" in
clear, convincing tones, that were plainly
audible all over the large hall. John F.
Sullivan chose for the subject of his essay,
"O'Connell." and his brief sketch of the
great Irishman was complete and interest
ing. William J. Rattigan sang a comic
#ong, entitled, ''Why Paddy's Always
Poor," the inference being that he was
always too honest to be rich.
A short drama, in costume, '"The Sara
cen Brothers," was very dramatically ren
dered. J. Edward Taylor was Saladin,
Joseph M. O'Donnell Melek Ahdol, and
J. Henry Long Omar. The parts were
well sustained and the costumes were ex
ceedingly appropriate. Hugh Mclsaac
closed the first part of the programme with
an essay on "The Liberty BeM."
William Albert Kelly, .the orator of the
day, delivered a stirring oration. Mr.
Kelly had evidently given much thought
and study to his woric, and the result
showed much talent. The recitations of
H. J. Swords and J. L. Taaffe were very
clearly rendered. During the second part
a scene from "Julius Caesar" was presented
in costume by George M. Casar as Brutus
and John L. A. Jaunet as Cassius. This
piece was the gem of the evening, and the
declamation of both would have done
credit to professionals. The quartets were
rendered by W. J. Rattigan, "R. G. Drady,
J. L. Taaffe. H. J. Swords, J. L. Jaunet,
G. E. Havward, J. W. Solen, P. A. Dun
worth, J. F. Sullivan, J. H. Long, and
most of them received an encore.
The members of the class of '96 are:
John L. Jaunet, William A. Kelly, Maurice
J. Kiely, Hugh J. Mclsaac, Joseph M.
O'Donnell, James G. Sweeney, Louis V.
Brignole, Aloysius P. Mallon, Henry J.

GARRITY PAYS.
The Attorney Accepts the Dictum of
the Supreme Court and Tarns
Over His Bail.
Oaklasd Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 16. )
The contempt case of Attorney Garrity
is finished and the attorney has paid his
fine. About a month ago Judge Wood de
clared Attorney Garrity guilty of contempt
in the Police Court and fined him $25, with
the alternative of one day in jail. Garrity
appealed the case and it went before the
Supreme Court, on the ground that the
"Whitney act, under which the Police
Court was created, was unconstitutional,
and that therefore no such court exists.
The Supreme Court decided otherwise
and ordered that the defendant be re
manded.
To-day Judge Ellsworth in the Superior
Court entered a final order upon the writ
of habeas corpus in the case of the attor
ney, remanding the prisoner into custody.
Later in the day Attorney Garrity's bail of
$25, which was deposited with the police
office, was raid into the court as his fine.
This ends the case.
CORRAL HOLLOW STAGE.
One May Soon Be Inaugurated Between
r.ivermore and the Coal Mines.
LIVERMORE, Cal.. March 16.â J. L.
Miller, the Southern Pacific Company's
local agent, believes that a stage line from
Livermore over the "hill" to the mines
will pay. As soon as the Corral Hollow
road is finished, which will be in a few
weeks, all the coal mine traffic heretofore
enjoyed by Livermore will be diverted
unless tbestage line expedient is resorted
to. A great deal of the San Francisco pas
senger travel would naturally prefer the
route via Livermore and stage to the
eighty miles of railroading frorcfthis point
around by Stockton. On Thursday E. H.
Prentice, district freight agent of the
Southern Pacific, was in Livermqre and
discussed the stage line matter with Mr.
Mitchell and other citizens and evinced
much interest in it. He promises to send
a man to Livermore to' investigate the
matter.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 17, 1896.
SAYS SHE IS A BIGAMIST
A Sensational Affidavit Read
at the Hearing of the
Adams Petition.
WAS THE WIFE OF DR. DAY.
The Wife's Prayer for Alimony and
Counsel Fees Is Argued and
Submitted.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, March 16. f
Fred Adams' attorney presented a strong
affidavit to-day in support of his suit to
have his marriage annulled. It affirmed
that at the time the clandestine marriage
took place the woman he was wedding as
Miss Anita Day was known as the wife of
Dr. Day of San Francisco, and had so de
clared herself.
The proceedings to-day consisted of the
hearing of Mrs. Adams' petition for ali
mony and counsel fees. She sets forth
that she is in St. Louis without funds,
whereas her husband (Adams) is rich and
can easily afford to contribute to her sup
port. A second affidavit sets forth that
she is Adams' truly wedded wife, and as
such is entitled to the assistance sought.
Attorney Fox claimed the affidavits only
replied to one allegation of the plaintiff.
The defendant asserted she is the wife of
young Adams. This he denied, and as
serted that the marriage which had been
performed between his client and the de
fendant is void, because at the time she
was the wife of a man named Day, who
was alive at the time and who is yet alive.
Mr. Fox read an affidavit signed by
W. J. Harris setting forth that the affiant
knows the defendant, and that at the time
she was married to Adams, she was resid
ing in San Francisco and was known as
the wife of a Dr. Day and had so acknowl
edged herself.
"On these grounds," said Mr. Fox, "T
am opposed to granting the motion, and
I am also opposed to considering the mat
ter. The case is not one of divorce, but an
action to set aside a marriage that was
both null and void. The woman had and
has another husband still living, and she
is not now and never has been Adams'
wife. The motion is further opposed on
the ground that alimony can be granted
only as between husband and wife, and as
that relation never existed between plain
tiff and defendant the request should
be denied."
Judge Frick took took the matter under
advisement.

Charter Day.
BERKELEY, Cal., March IG.â With a
bullet wound at the inner corner of his
left eye, the remains of a man supposed to
be Michael Wickham. of . 716 Larkin street,
San Francisco, were found this morning
on the university grounds by John Irwin,
a gardener on the campus. i ;? .
The body when found was warm in
places, showing that the man had not been
dead long.
Inquiry at the drygoods store in San
Francisco by Sergeant Moffett elicited the
information that a man answering the
description had been rooming in the house
of Mrs. Butler, 716 Larkin street. Mrs.
Butler was seen and she said the old man's
name was Michael "Wickham, a miner from
Montana. He came here about a year ago
to get a cork leg, as he had his right foot
crushed in the mines, and his leg had to
be amputated above the ankle.
The old man had been, despondent for
some time and on Friday he i told the bar
tender in a saloon at 800 Larkin street that
he was tired of life. : Shortly before noon
Saturday he asked the owner of the saloon
as'to the time the left this sitle'of
tire bay for Oakland, and that was the last
seen of him here. ! y ' . â  - .
Wickham was about 60 years of age. He
has a brother, C. B. Wickham, Commer
cial House, South Dakota, who has been
notified of the suioide.
An inquest will be held to-morrow.
.Those IMysterious Markings.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 16.-=-The mys
terious juarkings on residences in Berkeley
that have been, reported during the past
few days continues to arouse a good deal
of discussion, especially in A. P. A. circles.
.â â 'â¢ It is asserted that the marks appear only
on the houses of Protestanty and members
of the American 'â¢â¢ Protective Association,
and -that two signs have been used
one for the residences of A. P. A's and the
other for the dwelling places of other
Protestants. As a consequence there is
m.uch gossip among local members, of the
! Protective Association; some of whom de
cJare the mysterious marking to have been
done for some purpose of discrimination
by agents of Catholic societies. ' /'.'
On the other hand, '"- it is said that the
marking is all a practical joke and that it
is the | work of tramps, who are known to
have methods of indicating to one another
by marks the = houses at which calls for aid
will prove profitable. The marking iis so
general, however, extending over a large
part of Berkeley,: that it would seem to
have been done for a purpose. .
How i the marks were made in so many
ca^es without' the pencil or chalk user be
ing observed is something of a - mystery.
The marks are in most cases easily effaced,
and this has b?en quite generally done. ; ; r
A local member of the A. P. A. stated
to-day that he 'bad rubbed, out the mark
! that was placed on his door,Â»and that any
! one attempting to replace the strange sign
would meet with a warm reception.

LIVED OVER A
HUNDRED YEARS.
Giovanni Agius, Oakland's
Oldest Citizen, Dies
of Dropsy.
FOUND IN POVERTY.
Taken Care of During His Last
Months by Catholic
Ladies.
EVER TRUE TO HIS ROSARY.
The Deceased Was a Soldier During
the Troublous Times When the
Century Opened.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, March 16. f
Giovanni Agius, who was known in Oak
land for many years as John Rogers, is
dead, and in^ his death Alameda County
Giovanni Agius, Known in Oakland for Years as John Rogers, Who Died Yester
day at the Age of 104.
[Drawn from life.]
loses her oldest citizen. Giovanni was 10-1
years old, and as his mother died when he
was 4 years of age, he has lived just an
even century since that event.
Agius was in possession of his faculties
till a few weeks ago and gave no sign of
dying of old age, but several days aÂ»*o he
was attacked with dropsy and soon the old
man passed away. He died at the resi
dence of Mrs. Hannegan, 604 Filbert street.
Giovanni was born at Malta in 1792, and
came to this country when he was 7 years
of age. In the war of 1812 he was a soldier
and remembered till a few months ago all
the details of those eventful times. Years
ago, in the early fifties, Aeius came to Cali
fornia in the ship Thompson, of which he
was second mate. He deserted, like thou
sands of others, and rushed to the gold
mines, and although then a comparatively
old man he took quite a fortune out of the
earth. "While in Seattle, twenty years ago,
Agius was robbed of what little money he
had hoarded and since then he has been a
broken-down peddler.
While in the possession of his health up
to about a year ago, he made a living by
selling fruit, and his face was familiar to
thousands of people, especially in the
West Oakland neighborhood. Sometime
ago the aged man was found by a Calt,
man in a shanty near tne water front. His
old horse shared tho barn, and a more
miserable place could not be pictured. A
sack of rags had been his bed for years,
and the neighbors said that even what food
he received was first used to feed the old
quadruped.
Throughout all his loner life Giovanni
never forgot the lessons of piety that he
learned in early life, .b'or over half a cen
tury before his death he wore a rosary
around his neck and never failed to make
' daily use of it. The beads have been so
lon^ around his neck, that there is a groove
in the old man's flesh which was made by
the beads having been so closely buttoned
around his neck. Au;ius used to say that
the Archbishop of Malta gave him the
rosary more than a lifetime ago.
After the publication of his story and
his abject destitution Giovanni was taken
in charge by the Catholic Ladies' Aid
Sociotv, and from that time till he
breathed his last was probably the most
comfortable and devoid of anxiety in all
his long life.
After Ihe ladies took the old man's wel
fare in nanu, papers in his possession
showed that his real name was not John
Rogers, but Giovanni Aeius.
Although everything possible was done
for him, his vitality was almost gone, and
when dropsy appeared it could not be re
sisted.
Agius' appearance, even in death, is that
of a well-preserved man of about 70 years
old. He Is a little under six feet in height
and he had a good crop of hair to the last.
His teeth were perfectly sound, and the
man must have Jived a very careful and
abstemious life to reach such a long score
of years. The funeral will be held to
morrow, and the Ciitholic Ladies' Aid
Bocietr, who took charge of nitn in life
will also see to the old man's burial. *
MRS. INGRAM'S DIVORCE
She Charges Ingram With a Great
airtny Cruelties and Wants
Alimony.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 16.â Alice L.
Itlgnxn has begun suit to obtain from
Robert H. Ingram a divorce. Defendant
is a switchman in the employ of the South

in and breeder of Shetland ponies, as well
as a dairyman. His family home was at
2220 Alameda avenue.
Mrs. Ingram's complaint is a uniotie
document. For the past two years de
fendant has treated plaintiff cruelly. He
was possessed of several ponies, and com
pelled her to clean and harness them
when he desired to drive them. If she was
not quick enough about it he would curse
her and apply to her most opprobrious
epithets, in November, 1894, defendant
threatened to do her preat bodily injury,
and terrified her by his attempts. He in
sisted on Keeping dogs and chickens in the
family dwelling-house, and by his violent
actions compelled her to flee several times,
only to be pursued, grabbed by the arm
and brought back again with curses. In
January, as she alleges, he ordered her out
of the house, telling her she should have
gone long ago. Ingram gets $60 a month,
and his wife wants him to provide for her
wants and furnish the means of carrying
on the suit.
Object of the League.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 16.â 1t is now
explained why some citizens of Alameda
organized a municipal ownership league.
Ostensibly it is to agitate and make popu
lar the owning by municipalities of elec
tric licht and water works. It was not
seen at lirst why such a move should origi
nate in Aiameda, for this City already
owns its light plant; but an attempt has
been made to go into the business 01 sell
ing incandescent lights to private con
sumers. This has been enjoin^! and it is
believed the suit to perpetually restrain
will succeed under the present law. The
league is formed as the first of a series
having for its object the changing of the
law so that cities will be permitted to sell
light.
A Young Man's Death.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 16.â Charles
B. liyder, residing at 315 Railroad avenue,
died to-day at St. Mary's Hospital, San
Francisco. He was 30 years of age and
unmarried, and was well known in the
mining regions as a contractor. He wa9
ill two weeks, and only, the day before his
death was removed to the hospital.
Cabalistic Marks.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 16.â The mys
tic inscriptions on door posts of residences
that puzzlea the people of Oakland
for some time have begun to make their
appearance in this city. The markings
have been noticed on houses in the vicinity
of Bay station. They are apparently
made with graphite and are generally in
the form of a double cross, over which is
the letter L, with a flourish in its final
3troke. The people of Alameda are as
much at sea over the cabalistic characters
as were those of Oakland.
An Architect's Fee.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 16.â Architect
Henderlons; caused to be attached the
large building just completed at Bay sta
tion. Henderlong prepared plans for the
building, as he claims under contract, but
they were not used. He brought suit in
the Justice's court to recover $299 99, and
pot a judgment. It was to realize on the
judgment that he caused the attachment
to be levied.
In the Parisian cemeteries'it is now cns
tomary to place metal boxes on the tomb
stones. Each box has a slit in the top,
and in it visitors drop tneir cards. The
relatives can thus see the names of persona

COLLECTING THE FUNDS
The Money for the Relief of the
Lepers Is Almost in
Hand.
Supervisor Benjamin Will Canvass
To-Morrowâ Contributions Sent
"The Call.'*
Supervisor Benjamin expects to have the
fund he has been collecting to buy the
Goto remedy for leprosy for the unfortu
nates at the Pesthouse completed by to
morrow night and will send it to Japan to
purchase the medicines by the next
steamer sailing for the Orient.
Up to last evening he had $130 of the
necessary $200 in sight. The last contri
bution that reached his hands was $10,
which came with the following letter:
San Rafael, March 14, 1896.
Dear Mr. Benjamin: 1 received The Call you
pent to me and being interested in the poor
lepers and in anything that will make life
bearable for them. I inclose a Wells-Fareo
order for $10, which is to go to the medicine
fund. Sincerely yours,
LorisE W. Wilkins.
"This lady, whom I only know through
her letters regarding the lepers," said Su
pervisor Benjamin yesterday, "has already
done much for the poor fellows at the hos
pital in addition to this* contribution of
money. About Christmas time she sent
them presents and clothing that were very
acceptable and were highly appreciated by
the lepers. I wish we had many more
friends like her.
"I want to see the fund completed.as
Foon as possible, and will put in all of
Wednesday calling on those who have
promised to contribute and getting the
money together. I think one full day will
finish the matter up."
In addition to the funds collected by
Mr. Benjamin and the money received by
The Call and turned over to the custo
dian of the fund the following amounts
have been left at The Call business office
within the past two days:
"Sympathizer" |2. ""J. L. F." $1 50,
"cash" $1, James Chisholm $1, "cash" 50
cents and "P. C." 50 cents.

SENATOR QUAY
FOR PRESIDENT.
He Favors Coast Defense, a
Great Navy and the
Nicaragua Canal.
GENIUS OF LEADERSHIP
Embodied in the Pennsylvania
Statesman and Man of
Letters.
VIEWS OF HON. W. H. ANDREWS
He is Quay's Able Lieutenant and
Describes the Qualities of the
Keystone Candidate.
Hon. William H. Andrews of Pennsyl
vania, ex-chairman of the Republican
Committee of that great State, a mem
ber, of the present Senate and chairman of
the investigating committee appointed by
the last Legislature to investigate the city
affairs of Philadelphia and Pittsburs, and
who is known as Senator Quay's nearest
friend and strongest lieutenant and who
made the great fight for Quay in the contest
over the State chairmanship there last
year, is in California with Mr. C'arkson
and his party at the Palace Hotel. He is
tne unique figure in Pennsylvania politics,
and Eastern politicians rate him as the
strongest fighter and the most successful
campaigner among the rising men in the
Republican party.
The Quay and Allison people seem to be
good friends, for Clarkson and Andrews
are traveling together in this tour of the.
West. Clarkson is known to have it as
the cherished ambition of his life to make
Allison President. He says lowa blood is
thicker than water, and that Allison is the
strongest man for the party as a candi
date and for the Republic as President. It
is also well known that he has an intense
admiration and unabating friendship and
devotion to Senator Quay. Clartson was
Quay's chief lieutenant in the great fight
of the National Committee to elect Harri
son in 1888, and since that time the two
men have been the closest and best of
friends.
Mr. Clarkson in talking yesterday said
that no one was so thoroughly misunder
stood by the mass of American people as
Senator Quay. The very greatness of the
power and the victory of genius in politi
cal generalship that he showed in over
whelming the Democrats in the ereat cam
paign of 1888 turned all the Democratic
papers of the country against him. They
saw that a man had arrived who knew the
Democratic party in its weaknesses and
â who could marshal the forces to defeat
that party even when it was intrenched in
National power. All their papers were
turned in to beat him into the earth.
Mugwump Republican papers joined in it,
and for a while the Republican party
seemed to have the cannibal spirit to
devour its own leaders. Since then, how
ever, the demonstration of Quay's power
in the Senate, his great ability in states
manship and legislation and the diffusion
of knowledge concerning him personally
throughout the country have contradicted
all these impressions, and he is now known
very generally to the country as a ripened
scholar, an accomplished legislator, a man
of letters, of high-minded motives, the
popular leader of his State, trusted by
every leader of the party in every State,
and is generally considered as the strong
man at the helm of Republican affairs.
These were the views Mr. Clarkson gave of
him yesterday.
Senator Andrews, who is a fighter rather
than a talker, and who has been educated
under the Quay axiom of never to talk,
but always to light, said that he felt like
breaking over the rule for once in his life
to talk to the Republicans of the West.
He recognizes in them tightinsr men like
himself, and so he consented to have an
interview on the subject of general politics
and Quay in particular. He said :
"I am in the West on business and to
see how broad the country is. We people
in the East forget that this is a country
3000 miles wide. Senator Quay, who has
never been a sectional man, and who is an
intense American, has long comprehended
the greatness of this country, and has
always stood ready to defend the interests
ol every State, and he is one of the great
statesmen of this time who realize that the
Pacific Coast must be admitted into the
Government and into party councils
ior a larger share in public affairs and in
the distribution of public power. I gained
my ideas of the breadth and strength and
generous spirit of the West from him. I
have come West to have it confirmed.
Pennsylvania has made itself rich by thrift
and industry and by the help of the Re
publican party through the tariff.
"As I have traveled through the West
and seen your mountains loaded with min
erals in New Mexico, Arizona and Califor
nia, lean see how several, of your States
are simply other Pennsylvanias, only
needing the development of your mineral
and natural resources to become as rich as
we ire. You have a splendid climate,
you have a thrifty people; you have many
things in your favor even over our East
ern States, and I must express my delight
and find renewed pride in Americanism
over the things you have accomplished in
your youth and the greater things that

SENATOR MATT QUAY OF PENNSYLVANIA.
[From his latest pliotograph.]
are certainly coming to you as you grow
older. lam amazed that so strong a peo
ple in- the various States on the coast and
of the mountains have not combined their
power and gone into National conventions
and asserted themselves in National ad
ministration more for their own protection
and benefit."
"Who are your people talking of, Sena
tor, as to the right man to nominate for
President by the Republicans this year?"
"In Pennsylvania and the East we look
upon protection as the main issue, but we
realize that the financial question must be
settled, as well as that of the tariff, to
bring back good times. We all admire Me-
Kinley, but in Pennsylvania we smile over
the stories circulated everywhere to the
effect that protection depends on him.
We have thought that we were a pretty
good protection State, and we have always
cherished the thought that Senator Quay
was equally as strong a protectionist as
Governor McKinley. Certainly no man
surpasses Quay in power in defense of
protection. He stood in the United States
Senate and demonstrated this, and com
pelled the Wilson bill to yield a great deal
of protection for Pennsylvania and also for
the whole West. Quay believes in the pro
tection of wool. He thinks, indeed, it is
largely the keystone of protection. We all
believe thisâ l mean the masses of Repub
licans in Pennsylvania and the East. We
admire Governor McKinley, but we know
that Senator Quay and many other of the
strong leaders of the party are just as
sound on protection and just as powerful
to help it. We look upon the Republican
party itself as the anchor of protection.
Pennsylvania is a great and generous
State. It has given many people of its
best blood to this and every other Western
State. It is a generous godmother, and
California can have no ambition for its
people that is not reciprocated by Pennsyl
vania and that Pennsylvania will not help
to carry out."
"How are good times going to be brought
back?"
"In many -ways. First, by the re-enact
ment of a wholesome and sensible tariff
bill; the inauguration of a great National
policy of internal improvements, coast de
fenses, improved waterways, the exten
sion of trade with South America, the
building of the Nicaragua canal and the
other great things that this Nation needs
and ought immediately to undertake. War
is in the air the world over. Our rich
Nation is a tempting prey, if we should
come into collision with foreign nations,
to all the Governments having powerful
navies. We have an immense seacoast,
little defense for it in forts and very in
efficient defense in the extent of our navy.
What we have is geod. in floating forts
and battle-ships and cruisers, but we have
not nearly enough to cope with the ene
mies that would be sent to override us.
Two hundred million dollars could be
gained at 3 per cent on a popular loan for
the money that is now boarded by all
classes â working people, farm boys, work
ing girls, clerks, small business men and
large business men, tooâ would gladly
come out of hiding to be invested in as
good security as Government bonds.
What would six million dollars a year be
for defense of all our seacoast, figured out
to what it would cost the average in
habitant?"
"Who is the candidate to win Republi
can success, to lead in tariff return, bring
back good times and inaugurate this policy
of great public improvement?"
"We have the man in Pennsylvania, the
man that we in our State know to be the
strongest, ablest, most resourceful and
most successful man in public life to-day.
His name is Quay â a conquering, tri
umphant name. His ambition heretofore
has been in his devotion to the State in
terests of Pennsylvania. In 1888 when the
Nation was in the bands of the Democ
racy the Republican party dispirited and
entering upon a doubtful campaign, he ap
peared as the leader, and laid such plans
of victory and so completely rallied the
support and confidence of the country and
by his power and genius of leadership so
demoralized the Democracy that he won
out the greatest victory ever won against
heavy odds by a political general in this
country. He had the Democratic party
intrenched in National power in New York,
the great and necessary State, it was in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 17, 1896.
trenched in State and city power, it
also had the help of the money of
the importers. He saw the way to
victory, took his party along it, and by his
great ability gave the country a Republi
can President. In that he gave to the
people of the Nation a touch of the
power that is in the man as we have long
known him in our State. While Quay has
been the tower of strength to the indus
tries of Pennsylvania, while even in a time
when every other State failed he held the
free-trade Senate of the United States to
protection for Pensylvania, and while he
has ever been the leader of the strong
public and industrial force of the State, he
is even stronger with the common people
and is intrenched in the affections of all
classes in our State. No man in the State
has ever been bo much loved by the com
mon people nor so completely trusted.
He is as strong with all the better and
higher elements, independent of party, as
he is with the masses of his own party.
He is not an ambitions man. Honors
have come to him as duty seemed to call.
He has held many public places, led in
many fights and never been defeated. He
is a Republican through and through, and
is the very sort of man if he were elected
President who would strengthen its party
and make it invincible."
"This is interesting. Of course Senator
Quay is not so well known outside of Penn
sylvania as in it. Is he sincere in his can
didacy for President?"
"As sincere as any man ever was, and
the people of Pennsylvania areas sincerely
for him as the people, of Ohio are for Mc-
Kinley, or lowa for Allison, or Maine for
Reed. They know he has the ability to
be President. They know he has the de
votion to the people's interests to mate a
great President. Commercial classes and
manufacturers, farmers, workingmen
and bankers and business men know
that the public interests would be safe in
his hands, while the people know that he
would be true to their interests. As to
protection, no McKinley and no other
man surpasses him in devotion to its prin
ciples or power to defend its interests.
Beyond that he has broader ideas than
any man in the field. When asked a few
days ago as to his platform by some re
porters as he was leaving the Capitol, he
replied offhand : 'More tariff, more money,
more employment for labor, more in
ternal improvements, more American
shipping on the seas, more mar-,
kets for the surplus of American
farms and factories, more trade with South
America and Mexico, more seacoast de
fenses and a stronger navy.' This is a
winning platform, which would brina
good times. Quay could inaugurate and
carry it all out. Any idea that he is not
as trained in scholarship as he is experi
enced in statesmanship is wrong. He is
liberally educated, has the best library in
Pennsylvania, is the best read man iri"his
tory and literature that I know. And as
to practical reform he has inaugurated in
Pennsylvania a movement for municipal
reform, which is more needed than any
other reform in the Government, and thus
has proposed an actual reform which is,
needed most and can best be carried out.
Ac was a gallant Union soldier, was voted
a medal by Congress for bravery in battle,
is a lover of books, is popular in all
the homes of Pennsylvania, and last
year in the great fight . that was
made against him so unexpectedly the
churches and the church people were the
first to rally to his support and the strong
est in staying with him till the victory
was won. This is the kind of man that
Pennsylvania knows Quay to be, and they
know that he would make as great and
true and able and popular and faithful a
President as the Republic has had. Penn
sylvania will co to St. Louis in dead
earnest for him and he is developing
strength all over the country. He is broad
enough to be believed in in the South. He
is National enough to understand the
vVest, while every interest in the East
knows that all its legitimate rights would
be protected by him. He could be elected
triumphantly. He would rally the party
as it never has been rallied since Grant.
He would sweep the enemy before him,
and he would go into the White House
With a sweep of power and more than ful
fill to the people of the Nation everything
that Pennsylvania says of him now."
SENATOR W. H. ANDREWS of Pennsylvania, the Champion of Quay for President
[Drawn from a photograph.]
*'It would look as though Quay was a
pretty good Western man because of his
breadth and National patriotism."
"Yes, Quay is a thorough American.
He has among your Republican leaders in
California and all the other Western States
as devoted friends as he has in the East.
As a political general he sees the necessity
to the party of strengthening our lines
everywhere in the West, and he believes
that every Western State should have a
seat at the table of power in the Govern
ment and exert its influence in the Na
tional councils and conventions of the
party the same as an Eastern State. In
deed, he is as broad as the continent. He
is very popular in tne South, and has al
ways stood for appropriations for Southern
States for public improvements as strongly
as for Northern. The same is true as to
all improvements in the Western States.
Quay would make a good Californian. If
he should come out here yon would think
he was one of your own people. Men like
Mr. de Young, who was his asso
ciate on the National Committee in 1888,
and who I happen to know he ad
mires very much and believes in as a
Republican leader, always working for
the party interests, know how broad Quay
is, how anxious he is to make the party
strong in every State and to give to every
State its just rights in the Government.
The more Eastern men like Quay domi
nating affairs at Washington the better it
will be for the West. Western ideas control
him as much as any others. I could talk
all day about the Republicanism of Quay
and the fight at St. JLouis. My judgment
is that the conference at St. Louis is going
to be one that is very serious, and that in
the end all the men who attend there are
going to sit down and hunt for the very
strongest candidate the party can nomi
nateânot only one wno can certainly and
most easily -win for the party next Novem
ber, but who will go into the White House
and so strengthen our party with new issues
and with new evidences of its worthiness
to serve the Republic that it will give us
not merely four but twelve or sixteen years
of power. This is what Pennsylvania wants,
and in this I am certain Western Republi
cans agree with it. Come to St. Louis un
pledged, uninstructed and let us find .the
best manâ the best man for the East, who
will also be the best man for the West and
South."

BAND OF NORTH
BEACH BURGLARS.
They Have Terrorized the
Neighborhood for Sev
eral Weeks.
POLICE ARE POWERLESS.
Three Homes and a Store De
spoiled Within the Past
Week.
DETECTIVES AEE AT WORK.
A Thousand Dollars' Worth of Jewelry
and Plate Stolen From the
Rnss Residence.
The Police Department is greatly per
turbed over the recent North Beacn burg
laries, but their perturbation is mild com
pared to the disquiet and unrest which at
present prevails in the immediate region
of Powell and Broadway.
House-breaters have terrorized at least
the women inhabitants of that neighbor
hood, and within the past week four burg
laries have been reported to the police, but
none of the offenders have been caught.
Special orders have been given to the
patrolmen and detectives concerning these
house-breakings, but there the matter
seems to "have ended, so far as the useful
ness of the department is concerned.
Two of the burglarized families have
been frightened out of the neighborhood
and still others intend to move at once.
The police have given strict orders to keep
knowledge of the burglaries from the
press, and for nearly a week now they have
been entirely successful in this direction.
Meantime the depredations have con
tinued.
The most recent of these robberies oc
curred Sunday evening at the residence of
Maurice Ratio, the real estate man, 829
Broadway. While the family was away
thieves entered by the front win-iow, ran-
sacked the entire premises and departed
with everything of any value that was
portable.
Luckily there was no money in the
house, Mr. Ratto having made a deposit at
the bank Saturday morning, and retained
only a small amount of ready cash, which
he carried with him. When he and Mrs.
Ratto returned, about 10 o'clock Sunday
evening, they found the front window
wide open. This alarmed Mrs. Ratto, who
knew of the many depredations .in the
neighborhood, and she insisted upon not
entering the premises until a policeman
could be found to accompany them.
While Mr. Ratto watched at the open
window Mrs. Ratto went in search of the
patrolman. Finally the three entered the
house, but of course the birds had flown
and left only disorder behind them. They
had pried open the front window, climbed
from the front steps, tnrned everything
topsy-turvy in the house, stolen some
articles of jewelry, some silverware and
some of the more expensive pieces of wear
ine apparel and had then made their exit
âonto a busy thoroughfare, which is sup
posed to be patrolled frequently by a
policeman in the early eveningâ by that
same open window.
And this is the second time recently that
the Ratto residence has been entered by
burglars.
About a week prior to the Sunday-night
burglary the handsomely furnished resi
dence of Henry S. Russ at 1214 Mason
street was entered and despoiled of about
$1000 worth of jewelry and plate and bric
a-brac. Mr. and Mrs. Russ had only been
about a week in the house. They lived in
the lower flat, and as it was their initial
venture in housekeeping the furniture
and appointments were not only new, but
costly.
The burglars entered through the tran
som over the kitchen door in the rear.
Once inside they did fiendish work, de
stroying everything they could and ran
sacking the entire flat thoroughly. The
bureau drawers were emptied on the floors
and all the jewelry taken from them.
Their other contents were found torn,
broken and scattered all over the
house. A gTeat deal of silverware
was taken and whatever of
worth " was too cumbrous to be
carried off was broken. Several costly
vases and other pieces of bric-a-brac were
thus rendered worthless. Some good pic
tures were hacked up with a knife. Mrs.
Kuss' sealskin coat was stolen. The ruin
was about as complete as two men could
make in an hour's time. It appears that
these burglaries are committed by profes
sional workers, for they are carefully
planned and the whereabouts of the occu
pants are ascertained before the houses
are entered.
Mr. and Mrs. Russ returned home early
that evening, about 10 o'clock. Mrs. Russ
was so dismayed and frightened by the
scene of ruin which met their eyes when
they entered that she could not stay in the
house another night. They went down
town. af*er going through the house with
a policeman, and stayed at a hotel that
night. Since then they have been board
ing. What remains of their furniture and
household goods will be sold at auction
within a day or two. Mr. and Mts. Russ
are rather disheartened at their first ven
ture in housekeeping.
It was last Friday night that the burg
lars pried open the front door of Christian
J. Bruse's grocery-store at the northwest
corner of Pacific and Leavenworth street*
Luckily the miscreants could not locate
the secret cash-drawer, and in the regular
till there was but little coin. They stole
a few cigars, some cans of sardine? and as
much liquor and wine as they could com
fortably carry off. The police have not
been able to find the thieves yet.
Sunday night a residence on Bernard
street, near Jones, was entered, and though
the house was ransacked there was but
little stolen.
Exactly a week before this the residence
of William E. Donnellan, at 1406 Mason
street, was entered between half-past 6 and
10 o'clock at night. This is only a block
from the Russ residence, and' on the same
side of the street. The burglars entered
by the front window. There is a large
bay-window here, square m shape, with
small sashes on the side. The small sash
nearest the front steps was opened.
The loot was considerable. A $400 seal
skin coat was taken, together with a large
amount of jewelry that was less valuable
intrinsically than because the articles were
mostly heirlooms and keepsakes of the
family. Everything in the house was
ransacked, and much that was not stolen
was wantonly destroyed. Luckily there
was but $48 in cash in the house at the
time. Unluckily that was gone with all
the rest when Mr. and Mrs. Donnellan and
their dauehter returned home about 10
o'clock that night.
Mr. Donnellan rushed out and blew a
police whistle. It was answered by De
tectives Wren and Gibson, who had been
in the immediate neighborhood for some
time. They came in and examined
the premises for some clew that mieht
lead to the arrest of the burglars. All they
found in their search was a bunch of mis
cellaneous keys that had been dropped on
on the parlor floor by the burglars.
Yesterday afternoon, when a Call man
visited the house, Mr. and Mrs. Donnellan
were busy packing their furniture, prepara
tory to moving out of the neighborhood.
"I can't stay here any longer," ex
plained Mrs. Donnellan. "I am not
naturally nervous, but. since these bur
glaries in the neighborhood and our own
loss I have been unable to sleep at night.
It seems as if this neighborhood was in
fested by a regularly organized band of
housebreakers. One or two burglaries oc
cur every week. We are going to move to
another quarter of the City."
Several other families are also on the
point of moving and some have already
moved away. No one knows whose resi
dence will be next and at least the women
of the neighborhood are in constant alarm
every night.
Recently the burglars, apparently the
same band, made an attempt on the resi
dence of H. Darrus, who lives at 827
Broadway. They opened his front win
dow and "tied the lace curtains in a knot on
each side. Mr. Darrus nwoke at about this
time, and, finding the window open, went
to close it. This scared the burglars and
they broke and ran.
' Since Sunday night there have been no
burglaries in this neighborhood reported
to the police.

Annual E'ection of the Woman's
State Federation for Public
Good.
Tbe annual election of the "Woman's
State Federation did not pass off without
a ripple. Indeed, there was an eddy of
startling dimensions at certain stages of
the proceedings.
Mrs. M. F. Greenlaw caused the first
ripple by an inference that the tellers were
not as zealous and conscientious in the
count as they should be. A second count
settled the difficulty to all intents and
purposes except that the fair tellers looked
somewhat ruffled.
Mrs. B. Patterson, in the course of a
defense of an amendment she had pro
posed and Mrs. French had opposed at a
previous meeting, censured the retiring
president for her action, and claimed tnat
such an action was contrary to all prece
dent. Mrs. Florence Percy Matheson re
sented what she styled an insult to Mrs.
French, and, after some debate, Mrs. Pat
terson was contented to withdraw her
strictures. Mrs. French kept her temper
throughout the ordeal, and at the close
referred the objector to Roberts' rules 01
order in support of her position.
There was some contention over the
propriety of nominating another lady for
stcond vice-president after Mme. L. A.
Sorbier had signified her acceptance of tho
nomination. The result of the election
was that Mrs. M. J. Griffiths received
twenty-three of the twenty-seven votes
and was declarea elected. The following
officers were chosen: Mrs. E. E. Bates,
president; Mrs. Rose M. French, fir-t vice
president; Mrs. M. J. Griffiths, second
vice-president.; Mrs. Florence Percy Math
eson, recording secretary ; Mrs. D. k. Farr,
financial secretary; Mrs. L. A. Kimball,
corresponding secretary; Mrs. Nellie Bless
ing Eyster treasurer; Mrs. M. J. Payne
and Mme. L. A. Sorbier, additional mem
bers of the executive committee. The
election of auditor and a third additional
memberot the executive committee was
postponed till Monday, awaiting a reply
irom the nominees.
Mrs. Matheson's report as chairman of a
committee appointed to investigate the
practicability of opening an undertaking
establishment under the direction of tbe
Woman's Federation for Public Good was
not encouraging to such an enterprise.
She said their investigations had devel
oped the fact that there are six Chinese
undertakers who receive much patronage
from others than their countrymen in San
Francisco.
Mrs. French called attention to the fact
that the petition for the appointment of a
woman inspector of homes would come up
again after the next tax levy.
Mrs Bates recommended thkt a petition
be drawn up asking that designs for the
new municipal building be on exhibition
to the public for a week in order that
women may make suggestions as to ac
commodations for female prisoners.
Mrs. French supplemented this with the
suggestion that the condition of bodies,
when taken from the Morgue, should be
the subject of investigation by members of
the federation.

A new temperance restaurant has just
been opened in connection with the News
boys' Home at 113 Powell street. It is not
intended to cater to the boys themselves,
but rather to secure fashionable patronage
in order that the proceeds of the restaurant
may aid in supporting: the home.
The new lunch place will be managed
very much on the lines of the Woman s
Exchange. A separate dining-room has
been arranged for the boys, so that they
will not feel themselves forced to "put on
style" by the presence of fashionable vis
itors.
