Representative ' Maguire Says f the
Magnate Practically, Admitted
' Unfair Methods.
WASHINGTON, D."c, Feb. 14.â The
Senate Committee on Pacific Railroads to
day resumed its hearings on the various
bills before it for, the settlement of the
debts of the Pacific railroads to the Gov
ernment.
Winslow S. Pierce, general counsel for
the reorganization committee of the Union
j Pacific, presented for consideration a bill
. embodying the reorganization committee's
plan for the settlement of the Union Pa
cific debt. It provides for the appoint
ment by the President, the Senate confirm
ing, , of three members to investigate,
determine and report a fair cash value of
the claim of the United States, the au
thority of the commissioners to be conclu
sive as to the sum which, together with the
amounts appropriated for commissioners'
expenses, etc.. may be paid for the claim
and lien of the Government; the Secretary
of the Treasury, upon such payment, to
execute an instrument of assignment of
the lien and claim, reserving the sinking
fund, and giving authority to the pur
chasers to organize a new company, em
powered to acquire and operate the lines
and property of the Union Pacific."
The bill further repeals the provisions of
prior acts, which would be inapplicable to
the reorganized company under the new
conditions. ... It gives authority and direc
tion to the Attorney General in default of
payment of the amount fixed by. the Com
mission to foreclose the lien of the i Gov
ernment, and upon the sale to bid the
amount of the indebtedness to the Gov
ernment. AyA.:_ .;;;y_ __ il __ â¢'
â ^ Replying to questions, Pierce said ' there
was no reason, why the provisions of the
bill coulanot apply to the Central Pacific
as well, if the necessary rchauges. were
made in its wording. A separate - bill for
the other road, however, would be / more
practicable. *. *.fyr -v; "i.A A^AjAl
To an objection raised by Morgan that it
contained no provision binding the reor
ganization committee to pay the amount
found due by the commission,; Pierce said
such a provision could r be inserted, or, if
the reorganization committee did not ac
cept these findings, they could retire and
the Government could go ahead and exer
cise its rights in the property.
Mr. Coombs, representing the Credits
Commutation Company, an association
composed of 300 or 400 savings banks, scat
tered all over the country, having interest
in the Sioux City and Pacific Railroad, ad
dressed the committee in reference to the
affairs of that company. His proposition
was, in short, that the Government should
invest $5,000,000" of securities in building
250 miles of road from North Platte to
Sioux City, which he guaranteed would,
by completing connections with other
lines, give effectual competition. .'y .
Mr. Littler, in reply to Mr. Coombs, said
, the proposition of. the latter, stripped of
all sophistry, meant that Congress should
assist a lot of Boston bankers who had
.made an unsuccessful speculation. He
declared that Mr. Coombs asked $5000
more per mile than it would cost to build
the road for which he desired assistance. .
1 C. P. Huntington was then placed upon
thejstand after having been put under oath
in accordance with the Senate resolution of
yesterday. He said if the f Pacific roads
had been built as military necessities- he
knew nothing of it. He began by. reciting
the difficulties under which the Central
Pacific was constructed, and the difference
in cost of materials then and now. Rails
cost $140 a ton as compared with $30 for
sted- rails now; locomotives now costing
$5000 to $8000 cost then $20,000 and $30,000,
with 1 excessive freight cost ana high in
surance in bringing them around by Cape
Horn. Labor was high and everything
was paid for in gold. Mr. Huntington
sain he had at times been compelled pay
$2 20 in currency for $1 in gold. â¢ ( * â¢
When the Central Pacific was completed
the value .of all its . assests was not suffi
cient, to pay the debt by several millions
of dollars. It finally paid its construction
debt in full, although that 'construction,
by reason of the nature qf the country and
engineering difficulties, was greatly en
hanced. As an instance of this Mr. Hun
tington showed that since 1872 his com
pany had been compelled to expend $2,641,
--.000 for snowsheds alone. The road' had
never had any trouble with either the
white man or the Indian's. .Its line of road
had formed a barrier between the two and
prevented conflict and policed the country.
The Central Pacific was to-day, fie said,
the best equipped and could do twice the
business of all the transcontinental lines.
With a reasonable extension of time he
said the road could pay dollar for dollar of
its debt and all * accrued' interest. The
charge that the , Central: Pacific had not
done its duty toward the other lines, es
pecially Union Pacific, he said had no
basis; it was, as any one acquainted with
the facts knew, unjust. The orisinal idea
when these roads were built was that they
could do excellent' police duty. Little at
tention was then given to the question of
traffic.* ' He produced a map to show that
all the transcontinental roads had outlets
independent of the Central Pacific.
No one could, he said, show that the
Southern Pacific had been. responsible for
the diversion of business from the Central
Pacific. The statistics ' showed that of tbe
total freights on the Central Pacific and
The San Francisco Call.
Southern Pacific for. the ten years ending
in 1892 a the Central Pacific had carried 54
per cent against all competing lines, while
it "had during the same period dove 58 ; per
cent of the passenger business. The rec
ords showed that the Southern Pacific and
its ocean connections to New York had se
cured the greater part of their increased
business by driving off the" ships that bad
been carrying freight around the Cape, but
had taken J very little business that would
have gone by the Union Pacific. This busi
ness was taken at a small profit,^ which the
company was able to do because of the use
of its water line. All , the \ overland roads
were parties to the agreement to purchase
the tonnage of 'the steamship lines." The
object of this was to keep prices steady so
as to keep out of bankruptcy. * v ;-y.
* He denied ,in -response to a question by
Morgan, that this was done in order to
force the Pacific Coast to use the overland
railroad lines. There was; he said, no at
tempt to monopolize the freight of the Pa
cific Coast. ' "'"--' ' "' ?â **'%'Â£
â¢ Morgan urged that Huntington state to
the committee the differences between the
rates charged -by the steamship lines be
fore and after they made the agreement
with the overland roads.' \ ' â¢'-'
Huntington could not give these figures,
but stated that a copy of the contract had
been deposited with the Interstate Com
merce Commission. ' i:, 1 ! *â ' '. '~ ! *'.'A
After some' "discussion Huntington was
notified to appear before the committee
with a copy of the' contract and be ex
amined thereon. - '-*';* ' "â¢*""'
Huntington, continuing his statement
on the roads in general, said the Union
Pacific had itself initiated the competition
of. the 'Oregon- Short Line, which was
owned by the Union Pacific, and by charg
ing excessive rates on business done for
the Central' Pacific, while the Central Pa
cific had stood by the Union Pacific on all
through business when it could -do so
without detriment to the public.
Senator Thurston's bill; which contem
plated a consolidation of the Union Pa
cific ana Central Pacific, would, Mr.
Huntington believed, be .injurious, to the
interests of the owners of both lines. Such
a combination would force the extension*
of other lines west of .Ogden. No possible
advantage could accrue to the Union Pa
cific through the proposition of Senator
Thurston. The Central Pacific would con
tinue to pay all its debts and maintain
harmony among the lines centering at
Ogden. The question before the commit
tee was whether this road over the desert
should be used as a bridge for all the roads
entering Ogden or only one. of, them. So
.far as the rates were concerned they were,
he emphasized, low as any other ; road in
the world. under the "same circumstances
and surrounded by the same conditions.
Looking back upon the situation at the
time the acts of 1862 and, 1864 were passed,
Huntington said he would unhesitatingly
say that he never contemplated that the
Union Pacific and Central Pacific should
form, one continuous connecting line, to
be operated without being permitted to
make connections or arrangements for in
terchange "of traffic* with any other /com
pany which should compete for' a common
traffic. Proceeding to practical ques
tion before the committee, the j great, debt
I which is coming due, Huntington said he
had been in business sixty years and bad
always paid 100 j cents |on j the dollar. He
wanted to do so now. 1
He had nothing, to apologize for in the
construction of the Central Pacific and he
did not appear before the committee ask
ing equities or eulogies. ' He only asked,
in behalf of the Central 'Pacific, tnat Con
gress should treat the question of a set
tlement with the Government on business
principles. He recommended * that the
company pay as much interest currently
as the road could earn over its fixed and
'operating expenses other than the Gov
ernment,,claim, as all others than the
Government claim were, he contended,
perfectly good, there being little or ho
floating debt, and pay into the treasury of
the United States every six months a fixed
sum until the whole indebtedness.* both
principal and accrued interest, has been
paid. As these payments were made the
amount due the Government would be
steadily diminished, /while the property
would naturally '. continue to increase in
value. The company was willing to do all
it could; no corporation could do more.
Continuing on ( this J line, "Huntington
said he had hoped the Government would
take 14 percent interest on the' Central
Pacific debt and require a certain fixed
sum to be paid annually or semi-annually
until the whole' amount, comprising the
original principal and all '; back interest,"
had been fully â  satisfied. In doing this he
should consider that the company, had
done well by the Government, in view of
the fact , especially that . the road , had
received so little from \ the Government
business sent over it, compared with what
was expected. .' Mr. Huntington referred
to the early completion of the. Central Pa
cificseven years before the time allowed.
*â¢ The Government gave freely to the
Northern Pacific and the Atlantic and Pa
cific land which was of 'greater value than
the bonds and land granted to the pioneer
roads. v-'*- ; -*r'/ :
The Government, he continued, must
have ' realized * that in doing this it was
deliberately destroying or weakening 'the
security it had on the Central line, for the
reason that it was I taking away much of
its earning power from which alone the
Government could expect a return of the
money loaned. ./ . " " ' i .' . '
In - conclusion Mr. Huntington said . he
had faith in the committee to believe that
in the proposition *it_ : would lay before
Congress it would : not put / upon tbe Cen
tral Pacific a burden greater/than it could
bear. No man or set of men, Huntington
believed, could do as much for the Central
Pacific in clearing, off; its obligations as
could its builders. The record of the road
was clean, despite the cries of . the noisy
few who, like jackals, . howled âº' along its
tracks; 'and the great; mass of people oi
â¢California knew and appreciated the great
ness and value of -the work the Central
Pacific had accomplished. The â¢ company
had never .failed to fulfill all its contracts
with the Government, with States and
with individuals.'^ 'â '"-%â¢ '" "â  -*':
In response to a question Huntington
said it would be the worst thing the Gov
ernment could, do to sell out the Central
Pacific. 'â  ."â  y' : ' -'/â¢" * â â¢ ; --A
"1 would rather," /he : said, "have it
arranged for ub to pay a fixed sum every
year with the agreement, that if, at the
end of six months, we failed, the Govern
ment could come in without the interven
tion of either ; court or Congress and take
possession of the property.'" -j-.-, -*-'â -â '' V
Gear called Huntington's -attention to
the statement that the -Southern Pacific
had been \* built out \ of the profits of the
Central Pacific. < This was denied' by Hunt

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 15, 1896.
Co. lis P.â Somebody stole your anti-funding resolution hey ? That's funny.
-Was built now, for it has all been paid for.
,We built it by issuing bonds, every one of
which has been redeemed. We', issued*
$33,000,000 of bonds on 1000 miles of road.
It was an expensive piece of road.. We
succeeded in keeping the bonds from"going'
into the general market until the road was
able to pay its /interest and something jl
mow. Prior to that^^ an effort 'was' made to |
sell some of; the bonds at very low prices,
but the sale was defeated. /,- hen the road
began paying more than its interest I sold
some of the bonds at 90, and later on at
better figures. By keeping the bonds out
of the market until the roa/i thus made a
good showing I succeeded in saving $16,
--000,000 to the company. None of the earn
ings o the Central Pacific ever went into
it."
Frye asked: "Say you had $2,000,000 a
year to start with, could you not, after a
lapse of ten or twenty years, increase the
annual payments of the principal?" y ; v >
"Of course," replied Huntington, "we
will carefully consider such a scheme, but
it would be impossible to pay $2,000,000
annually to begin with. It would be reas
onable to increase the principal as the
interest decreased."

WASHINGTON, D.C., Feb. 14.-Repre
sentative said to The Call corre
spondent to-ni^ht:; "Other business pre
vented * my attendance at the Senate Com
mittee on Pacific Railroads to-day, so I
have seen only a" synopsis of Mr. Hunting
ton's statement. I have read it carefully,
but have found nothing new in it except
his answer to the charge that the Southern
Pacific Company has diverted traffic from
the Central Pacific, and therefore from the
Union Pacific also, to the Southern Pacific
road. " His answer contains admissions
that completely establish; the charge we
have . made in that . behalf. jÂ§ He says that
the 'Southern Pacific Company obtained
its business (for the Southern Pacific road)
by going into a competitive field i for it.' ,-;-..
"Now, what does that/ mean? Why,
simply "that the Southern Pacific Com
pany enters into competition for freight
traffic for the Southern ;, Pacific road as
against the Central Pacific Railroad, while
controlling both roads. Theybwri the South
ern Pacific Railroad and ". have no interest
in the Central "Pacific, except "to - receive
salaries and expenses for operating it, ac :
according to Mr. Tweed's statement in the
House committee in answer, to 'my ques
tions. The 'Southern Pacific Company/
therefore, controlling both roads and com
peting for traffic on behalf ,of one of them,
in which it is interested, against the other,
in which it has only that nominal interest,
is sure to build up the one and destroy the
other as a mere matter of business. .. Now,
the Government is interested: only in the
Union arid Central Pacific I roads, and the
competion, ; of ; which 'A Mr. Huntington
speaks, is calculated to destoy .'orieof these
roads, thus 'destroying the 'â¢ Government's
only source of payment,' if the debt be re
fused. ; - .""*"_/
"Again, Mr. Huntington admits that
the Southern Pacific Railroad is underbid
ding the Central "Pacific' in the matter of
freights. He says: 'This , business (over
land freight) / has -been , taken at a Very;
small profit, which the company was able
to do, because of trie use of the water line.'
By the water line he means the Morgan
line of steamers from New Orleans to New
:- York. Now, it does not matter why the
Southern Pacific Company is thus cutting
under the Central Pacific for the benefit of
the Southern Pacific Railroad. *No matter
what the reason may be, . the . important
thine is that it is doing so ; and if the Cen
tral Pacific Railroad is left 1 under its con
trol, as the funding bill would leave it, the
people will ,; be ; deprived of â¢ the benefit of
real competition/ that would/ exist if the
Central Pacific Railroad were either owned 1
by the Government or by a t competing
company, arid 1 the United States' Govern

FRANKFORT, Ky,, Feb. , 14.â Collis P.
Huntington is continuing his tight against
the passage of the bill to repeal the South
ern Pacific i charter -in his characteristic
manner. He has on the ground actively
at . work against the | bill several of the
ablest and most renowned lawyers of the
State. These lawyers will not admit the
purpose of their stay here, . but their per
sonal influence is 1 , being used against the
bill. Hon. St.,Â« John Boyle of Louisville,
who was elected Judge of the Appellate
Court and contested the seat of Judge B.
Toney, who was given * the seat by a vote
of 3 to 2 by a Democratic contest board, is
here in the interest of other measures, and
his 'â¢ relations /with corporations leads to
the -belief that he is lending valuable aid
to Huntington's men. : ; .. -- â  -Ay,
\ i Senator ) Goebel,, who \is fathering the
measure in the Senate, said to The Call
correspondent : this evening:. ; "I ; cannot
say the exact day the biU will, be called up
in the Seriate, but ; it .will be j within the
next; day or two. I have no fears of ; the
passage of the bill, as the friends of the
measure have unmistakable assurances
from Senators that guarantee - its sue-'
cess." '. - - ,-â â .'â , Â.. .. ,, â  ,
':.- No action has been, taken by, the House
Committee on Corporations having before
it for j consideration the duplicate; of ; the
Goebel bill, arid there will probably not be
any until after , the measure has passed the
Senate in order , that s the measure; may
come regularly before the House. It is be-"
fore the House committee that the Hunt
ington people hope to kill, the measure.
Friends of? the bill are aware of these tac
tics' and will see that the bill does not get
cold before it has traveled this gauntlet. .;
; Senator Goebel has his eye on that t bas
tard brother to his bill .which/ was intro
duced in the House /yesterday; by Repre
sentative W. H. Stiglitz of .. Louisville arid
so quietly referred to the ;' Committee on'
Corporations, of which Mr. Stiglitz' fellow
townsman is trie chairman. ./ There is cer
tainly good reason to. think that there is
some ulterior motive behind ; this unusual 1
act, which in the face of the fact that the
Goebel bill had already been acted upon
by the Senate committee and ; was already '
before that body admits of -no!: other con
struction than a desire ?to affront '.Goebel'
or a purpose to betray the â¢' interests of the
repeating party ultimately defeat Goe
bel's bill if possible. J 'A All ..."/ . '-.': "* - â : yAyi"'
v /Stiglitz avows that he did not act on his
j own motion, but ; at '* the instigation of
another, whom he refuses to name. This
is certainly rather a peculiar way,: for Mr.
Stiglitz to act. j His experience in ward
politics in Louisville should teach him not
to allow himself to be made a catspaw by
any one | who is -riot" willing to have his
name j known ;* in connection ; witn tbe
measure. The "murder will out," how
ever, the course of j a few days, and in,
the meantime those interested . will have ;
to content themselves with studying: what
is already known to Mr. Stiglitz . and his
colleague,; Mr. J. C. Freeman, ! and sur
mise a-i to the motives actuating the intro
duction of this bill. y . . .v.- ;'â '
Mr. Freeman was engaged in business as
a printer and publisher in one of the
interior, towns of. Kentucky until ; the
spring of 1895, when he moved to Louis
ville. He was not regularly established in
business on his own account, but worked
principally with the Courier- Journal Job
Printing Company and the Baptist Book
Concern. .Together with most of j the em
ployes of the latter house, he is said to
have taken an active part in the organiza
tion of the A. P. A. movement in the city,
and to have been in close consultation with
Dr. Hunter after jhe moved to Louisville
and, began the work of organizing the Re
publican State campaign, and is said to
have had a useful hand in making the Re
publican organization in the city of Louis-.
ville. - . ; - ,*y a' a.a:. ."â â 'â ';/.' a ' Ay-'y. '
- He was for Dr. Hunter in the : caucus.
Besides the chairmanship of the Commit
tee on Corporate Institutions,' he held' a
place on the committees on r Military Af
fairs and Printing,' and is a member of the
committee having* the Kaufman-Dunlap
contest case in charge.
- Mr. Stiglitz has, ; since his apprentice
ship, been engaeed in the foundry busi
ness ;in the city of Louisville with * his
father and three brothers. They have al
ways been - good Republicans and, espe
cially has W.H., the present member, been
active in the politics of their * ward. \V.
H. is said to have been one of the early
members of the A. P. A. organization, and
to have been one of i the founders! of the
lodge near his voting ; precinct. His ex
perience in legislation was, until he came
to Frankfort, confined to occasional visits
to '," the Louisville ,= City: Council chamber.
He has a great deal to learn yet, but he is
not likely to be ; made. a tool of ' very long.
He said that he would % tell who 'risked
him to introduce that bastard bill in a few
days, and Billy is pretty sure to /keep his
word. A His ;â¢ disingenuity ; is evidenced by
his defending his silence as to the author ,
of . the bill f before : he was attacked. â¢'â â¢. The
Courier-Journal ' may possibly be wrong
in saying i that - the offering * of â¢ that bill
has the "look of being either | for useless
party or personal advantage." -While: it
certainly, has ;_ something 'of that look .it
may be that Mr. Stiglitz: is being imposed"
upon. That he should be the one selected '
for the work is i not so very, surprising to
those ; who know him. . If -Frankfort is
consumed by fire during this.; session it
will not ; be ; solely due to * the fact that
Stiglitz is there. He has not v had much
practice in setting worlds afire,' but he
really does know how ?â¢ to keep his month
shut.'and so; makes a good member of a
secret society. â¢â¢*â¢â 
; .â¢-.* It maybe said en passant that*rumor has
it that two-thirds of the employes, big and
little, of the' L. arid R. N. N. and M. V. R.
R. in Kentucky were members of â the A. r
P. A. organization. y One of j them â¢ might
have asked Stiglitz to introduce â â . that bill.
One of \ ; the 'big ones : probably. '. Stiglitz
has been highly ; honored _ by 'Speaker
Blandford - in making up his House com
mittees. Besides ' being -associated*^ with
Mr. Freeman on Corporate Institutions he 1
is on the committees on Enrollment arid â 
Agriculture and Manufatures.
\ * When Stiglitz asked to have his bill re
ferred to the Corporate Institutions Com
mittee he probably ; acted ' under instruc
tions of the man who pulls the string and
with the expectation that he Freeman
could control things: l there.-- They will be"
.'disappointed,' however. ; On the : commit
tee with : them are: ' J . W. Catron, a lawyer,
of Albany, Clinton County (R.); J. M.
Chambers, physician, Independence, Ken
ton County (R.); J. C. Gillespie, farmer.

banker, Lexington (D.); 'â .'. C. M. White, â¢
traveling salesman, Elizabeth town, Har
din County (D.). r( â¢ . " v 'â¢"â ..
| At least two of these will be in favor of
acting in concert with' .the party having
the Senate bill lint charge and will .fight
any'attembt to use Stiglitz's bill as a

.V Goebel does not have a great deal to say
about his plans in regard to the bill, but
expresses entire confidence that it will
pass* both houses, though he recognizes
the fact that the main light is to be in the
House. - : ' 'â¢ " : v.:VV""
If he is advised 'as to the plans the Hunt
ingtnn party have in view he J is averse to
saying any thing, about it. but from what :
is known of the man . they are not going
to spring many surprises upon him. They
will find his line, as formidable when, in
the House as it is in the Senate, and some
thing more than the usual parliamentary
tactics will be required to beat the bill, if
it is beaten. "./,. . â¢ '
The editorial in the Capital is still caus

, The , Capital is a weekly, during the best
part of the year, and .a . daily when the
Legislature is in session. Nearly ever
since the f war it has enjoyed the fat con
tract for the public printing, and so makes
up a daily from the type set for the jour
nal at small expense. Mr. E. Polk John
son, a Democrat, is the editor. He was
formerly city. editor of the Courier-Jour
nal. That he did not write"The South
ern Pacific" article can be seen at a glance
by any one who knows his style. Nor is
the style that of General Duke. It is not
a bit like him. It rather looks as if it had
been written by Colonel Thomas M. "iJul
litt of Louisville, whose name is intro
duced in the article in the following con
nection: Â.' ";'/â â  .. ~ .
To carry out such a project and consolidate
the various railroad companies and - their
roads which it must necessarily include, and
which, of course, were chartered by different
States, it was important, indeed essential to its
success, that"' there should be' one comprehen-
Rive organization by. means of which all the
subordinate corporations might be united into
one well compacted system. This was as nec
essary indeed >to the ; construction as to the
â¢ ultimate operation of the lino. Mr. Hunting
ton therefore obtained from the Legislature of
Kentucky a charter 1 ; for the â  Southern Pacific
Company. This charter granted, etc. *â ;â â¢'â 
â¢ This charter was obtained for Mr. Hunting
ton by the efforts and representations o/ Gen-;
eral John Eckols -and Messrs. Henry D. Mc-
Henry and Thomas W-. Bullitt. These gentle- 1 ,
men were principally interested because Mr.
Iluntington, in pursuance of his general plan,
was then projecting the extension of j the
Chesapeake and Ohio road into Kentucky and
the completion of the C. 1 O. and S. W., enter 1
prise* which have been of vast benefit to Ken
tucky. Those roads were associated into the
.general system under the â¢ Newport News "and ,
Mississippi-Valley Company, a' charter similar:
in purpose to that of the Southern Pacific Com-
( pany. r: -\';\'4^J^- .l:"'t^^ : , Vl- '-'J â {â *''.-' '
Â§ Now, the foregoing is Tom'^BullitUover
again. ( It is his ; style . from v beginning to
end, and he certainly enjoyed fuil facili
ties for knowing Mr. Huntington's plans ;
â¢when he got the charter, for he has been
his confidential lawyer at Louisville from
the very first. ' Rathe- strange that Hunt
ington himself in his letter to the Courier
should have overlooked colonel Bullitt's
valuable services in securing the charter.
He mentions Echols and McHenry, but
leaves out the Colonel, who now, inno
cently, of course, gives it away.
A bill was presented to the j House on
last bill day which is very interesting in
connection with the question of the power
of the ; State of â¢ Kentucky to repeal the
charter of the Southern Pacific Company.
This bill was presented by Representa
tive Lyons of Newport, Ky., and provides
for repealing _ the charter of the Twelve
mile Turnpike Company. This turnpike
is not quite as long as the Southern Pa
cific system, but like it the company own
ing it has a monopoly, and: has ground
and oppressed the ' people till they have
called on the Legislature for help. The
majority of the stock of the road Is owned
by ex-Senator Thomas S. Jones, who is as
rich in proportion to the length of his
road as Huntington is to the Southern
Pacific's unbroken line of iron from New
port News to San Francisco, and is always
ready :to contend ' for ! his rights. > The
Twelve-mile Turnpike runs from Newport,
which is in the extreme northwestern cor
ner of the county, to Alexandria, near the
center. . . '.
â ; It is the only road r leading to that
quarter from :â¢ Newport. The picnic
grounds and all three ;of the Newport
cemeteries are situated on it, and nearly
all the market gardens. Seven-eighths of
all : the vehicles entering the s city Dass
through its , tall . gates, and the company
has reaped rich returns from their small
investment, and consequently â is loath to
give it up, but Colonel Jones is' too good a
lawyer to dispute the power of the State to
take away what she gave. ' The charter of
his * road antedates that of ' the Southern
Pacific Company many years, and prob
ably has ten times as many vested rights
in proportion to its length as any railroad
in. the country. V. â¢ ' / .

Non Concurrence in the

Senate.
OVERWHELMING VOTE,
After Two Weeks of Argument
It Is Decided to Stick to
the Bond Bill. '
GEORGIA DEMOCRATS DISAGREE
Ex-Speaker Crisp Advocates FreÂ»
Coinage, While Turner Loudly
Protests Against It.
WASHINGTON, D. ,C, Feb. 14.-By 'a
vote of 215 to 90 the House to-day, after
debating for almost two weeks, decided
that it would not concur in the Senate's
free silver coinage substitute for the bill of
the House authorizing bond sales to main
tain the gold reserve, sales of treasury cer
tificates to meet temporary deficiencies, in
revenue and providing additional revenue
for the treasury. Nothing . else was pre
sented in the course of the five hours' ses
sion. The closing debate was notable prin
cipally because of the fact \ that the main
speeches for and against free coinage of
silver were made by two Democrats, both
members of the Committee on Ways and
Means and both from Georgiaâ Crisp and
Turner, respectively. The closing speech
against the Senate's substitute was mad*
by Dalzell (R.) of. Pennsylvania. The
speeches were of unusual length, and
throughout the. speakers were heard
with attention and apparent inter
est, the* novel spectacle of Crisp
and Turner arrayed against each other be
ing a stroug factor in the case. While
Crisp was \ speaking Senators Pritchard,
Lodge, Burrows, Palmer. Tillman, Bacon,
George, Cockrell and Mantle Â£nd Secretary
Herbert were observed on the floor. When
.the debate had been concluded the previous
.question was ordered, pro forma, and at
.the k suggestion of Dingley, (R.) of Maine,
in order that there might be no misunder
standing,. it was put in this form:
Â "Shall the House concur in the Senate
.substitute?" A **â¢-'< :^- ;
'} The ; roll was called amid extraordinary
quiet, arid at its conclusion the cause of
absence of those not present was stated by
their colleagues, so great was the anxiety
to have the record show the attitude of
every member toward the proposition. A
study of the vote shows that 25 Republi
cans. 58 Democrats, 1 silverite and all the
Populists present voted in favor of free
coinage, and that 184 Republicans and 31
Democrats voted against it. The Democratic
vote against free coinage was six greater
than the Republican vote for it.
This matter being disposed of the House
took a recess until 8 p. m. to consider pri
vate pension bills.
"Commencement day" of the debate on
the silver bill in the House attracted no
more spectators in, the galleries than any
day of the past few weeks, during which it
has been the pending business. There
was, however, a larger number of Repre
sentatives in their seats than usual.
Those who had , been \ off to j Lincoln day
banquets. in .various cities had returned
and .were on hand to vote, and many who
had not hitherto felt â¢ it . necessary or de
sirable to listen to the discussion as it pro
ceeded came in to have their votes re-,
corded on the. question. As soon as the
journal had been read the last stage of the
debate' upon the financial question as
involved from the Senate free-coinage sub
stitute for . the j public bond revenue bill
was entered on.
Crisp (D.) of Georgia, the Democratic
leader, began the closing speech in favor
of the free coinage of. silver. By. unani
mous consent he was given as much time
as he desired in which to complete his re
marks. In the outset Crisp said he would
endeavor to conduct his part in the disÂ«
cussion so as to offend no member of the
House. This was an economic question,,
and he would assume that every member
would vote upon it in accordance with his
convictions. >. In 1873, he asserted, the
United .States, demonetized silver. This
had been questioned in the, course of the
debate. \ From 1782 to 1873, the United.
States had had bimetallism. This propo
sition also, he said, had been controverted
by advocates of the single gold standard,
who now maintained that notwithstand
ing the existence of the statutes upon thisy
subject there had really not been bimetal
lism in this country. . The confusion, in
his opinion, grew out of the failure to dis
tinguish â ' between a ; standard â¢ and a â  cur
rency. This distinction existed, and he
quoted from a I message from President
Cleveland, "who ought to be satisfactory
authority to the gold standard advocates,"
to show that it was appreciated. The law
of 1792 establishing the . Mint . contained
the basis of the bimetallism for which the
Democratic party had always . stood, and
which it now insisted should be restored;
that bimetallism which - provided for the
equal coinage of coins of two metals, both
of which are of the same debt-paying and
purchasing power. A, The standard of value
m prised both â â  metals.' .'â¢
In his argument on this point Crisp as
serted that the standard: of value was
based upon the use of all the money in the
world and not upon that of any single or
particular. nation. As long as any com
mercial nation opened its mints to silver
the standard of value was based on both
gold and silver. . That was the conditions
up to 1873, when the United States de
monetized silver. â  Discussing the effect of
the law of 1873, Crisp said it was "sticking
in the bark" for any gentleman to say that
law could not affect values. The law could
and did affect values by regulating the de
mand for the article jto: be valued. That
,was the way, j in which the act of 1873 re- .
duced the value of silver, by reducing the
demand for it as money. . If law could not
affect values, he asked, how could an in
ternational agreement affect values!
** . -2
What did the platform of both great po
litical parties mean when they said that
they favored the resumption of silver coin
age under international agreement or sur
rounded by necessary legislative restric
tions? If law could not affect values what
did we mean, Crisp asked, by saying that
we would trust in the maintenance of the
parity of the two metals by "legislative re
strictions?'
Crisp asserted that the results of the de
monetization of silver in 1873 had been
most disastrous. . They were first seen in
the struggle for gold by all the nations.
In this connection he quoted from a speech
made by Senator Sherman in 1876, in which
he (Sherman) averred that the partial de
struction of silver as a money metal "was
felt by every man, woman and child who
had anything to sell." He (Sherman) re
ferred in that speech to the "appreciating"
purchasing power of gold, an assertion
which was now vigorously denied in the
House.
Another result, Crisp said, was seen in f
the constantly falling scale of prices which
had existed since 1873. While this was
the condition under which business was
conducted no man could tell where he
stood, and doubt, distrust and distress
necessarily ensued. The unfortunate con
dition of manufacturers and agriculturists
was not confined to the United States,
but was to be found in the gold
standard countries everywhere. In
support of this he read from
an interview on the 9th of the
month with A. J. Balfour, First Lord of
the Treasury in Salisbury's Cabinet, and
from the Queen's speech delivered on the
lliii. There was no probability, Crisp
said, in view of Balfour's declarations, that
England would assent to any international
agreement for free coinage, and he was of
the opinion that nothing substantial could
be looked for from any other Government.
The treatment of silver in the United
States, he was satisfied, had been part of
the general conspiracy or movement to
strike down silver. He reviewed the
financial legislation in this country since
Â 1873 and the policy of the Treasury De
partment from the time of the resumption
of specie payments, and charged that by
whomsoever administered the Treasury
Department had piayed the part of "wet
nurse" to silver, "seeking to endeavor to
maintain it in the markets of the world,
and thereby discrediting it."
Referring to Secretary Carlisle's refusal
to change silver for cold, "because he must
retain the silver to support the treasury
notes issued under the act of 1890, and yet
when one of those notes is presented he
redeems it in gold." Crisp exclaimed:
"What kind of juggling- is that with the
American people? What kind of friend
ship for silver is that?" [Applause.]
"It is not the coinage of every - ounce of
silver which gives it it's value," said the
speaker, "but the right of every ounce of
silver in the world to be coined." [Ap
plause.]
Wore that right restored, he claimed,
the old parity of the two metals would be
speedily restored. Crisp said the country
was not likely to receive any substantial
relief because this Republican Congress
was a "do .lOthing Congress." [Laughter.]
That was the platform on which it was
proceeding. The present preferment of
the* specially preferred creditors of the
treasury, by which they received gold for
their claims, he said, was the deliberate
surrender by Republican secretaries of the
treasury of the optional rights of the Gov
ernment which had been followed, he re
gretted to say, by Democratic officials.
The maintenance of the parity of the two
metals was the declaration of the Sher
man act of 1800. The Bland-Allison act
' contained no provision on the subject.
Referring to the "endless chain," Crisp
said the Government was engaged in the
most expensive financial experiment ever
undertaken in the history of nations, and
he asserted that one probable result would
be the locking up of all the greenbacks,
thus bringing about a reduction of the
volume of the currency, which the Repub
licans would not vote to do. The final
question. Crisp said, was: Could the United
'States single and alone undertake, with
the expectation of maintaining it success
fully, the free coinage of silver? He be
lieved it could. If it be conceded that an
international agreement could restore the
old ratio between gold and silver, he said,
then it was conceded that the law could
affect values and the practical question
was not whether all power was behind the
movement, but how much power. [Ap
plause.] Crisp quoted from the late Secre
tary Manning to prove that it was possible
for the United States to restore and main
tain silver coinage "that was in the days
before it bad been discovered that law has
no power to affect values." ' [Applause.]
Quotations were made from Sherman's
speeches and letters by Crisp to show, he
said, "the reasonableness and propriety of
our contention."
"He did not believe," commented Crisp,
"in the modern theory that law cannot
affect values, and thatotherone: that this
country cannot alone undertake the free,
coinage of silver." [Applause.] "
The United States needed more
money, said Crisp, than any other two
or three nations, relatively and in bulk.
What the friends of silver asked was that
the. old conditions be restored; that the
United States undertakes for itself and
mankind what France, greatly inferior to
this country, maintained for a period of
seventy years; that the law be observed in
the exercise of an option in favor of the
people in the transactions of the Treasury
Department, and, finally, that the owner
of 371Ji grains of silver may take it to any
mint in the country and receive for it a
dollar of American money.
"If we return," he concluded, "to the
conditions of our fathers, and return to the
financial independence of the Nation, we
may not only hope that prosperity will
again beam upon us as a people, but that
it will continue to be our portion." [Ap
plause.]
Turner, Crisps political colleague on the
committee and a Representative from the
same State, followed the ex-Speaker in
opposition to the Senate substitute. He
was opposed to the free coinage of silver
for tbe reason that all human experience
showed that the introduction of a cheaper
or inferior money was always followed by
the departure of the better money.
Coming then to the. main question,
"Can the United States, singly and alone,
maintain the parity of gold and silver
under free and unlimited coinage of
both?" which Turner said his colleague
asked several times, but at; no time tried
to answer, the speaker said he could
prove the negative to any fair-minded man
by any process of proof or argument with
which mankind was familiar. From the
experience of the United States Turner
proceeded to show that it could not main
tain free coinage, reviewing^ the several
efforts in the Bland-Allison act of 1878, the
Sherman act of 1890, to coin more or less
silver, but under both of these the price of
silver had steadily decreased. The
United States had not alone been thus en
gaged in an effort to maintain silver. The
report of the Director of ,' the Mint showed
that there had been coined in the world in
the period beginning in 1878 about ; $2,700.
000,000 of silver, and that the entire ' stock
of .silver money amounted to about $4,000,
---000,000. In conclusion Turner made an
elaborate argument . to show .-. that the
United States could not maintain silver
coinage and that an attempt to do so
would cause a financial convulsion in the
country. ':..'â¢â  vAy. .
Dalzell (R.) .-. of Pennsylvania, -also a
member of the Ways arid Means Commit
tee, made the closing speech of the day.
He asserted that ' the main proposition
involved in this discussion .had;: not been
considered.. That proposition was whether
this House was ready to abandon its own
legislation and accept the legislation of
the Senate, which was in no way germane
thereto. He warned the silver ,' men that
their cause would not gain by an attempt
ed humiliation of the House or its subjec
tion fo the demands of the Senate. The
free coinage of silver" as a ; separate propo
sition was one thing arid as presented by
the revolutionary methods of the Senate it
was another thing. He denied that silver
was demonetized by the act of 1873. The
history of the demonetization had to do,
he said, with natural causes, the law of
supply and demand. * It was not ' of the
slightest- consequence, he said, if it was
demonetized by that act.
"What bearing," he said,""has that upon
the expediency of the United States de
claring now that 50 cents is equal to 100?
The practical question is not one of morals
or historyâ what was right or wrong in
1873, but what is right in this year of our
Lord 1896." '
He went on to show that before 1873 gold
and silver circulated concurrently as money
at 16 to 1, and that every commercial na
tion in Europe, except England, threw
open its mints to the free coinage of silver.
Before 1873 the annual product of silver
had held one unvarying place. Since then
the silver product had been increased by
150 per cent.
Dalzell said there was in the world be
tween $3,500,000,000 and $4,000,000,000 worth
of silver. Every ounce of that was worth
in the market 50 cents. The assertion of
the free silver advocates is that by the pas
sage of a law in the United States there
would be added $4,000,000,000 to the value
of that silver.
"I ask you in cold blood if a more
preposterous proposition than that ever
was made?"
In conclusion Dalzell said that what this
country needed was not more free coinage
of silver, but more revenue through its
custom-houses. [Applause.]
This concluded the debate, which had
occupied nearly two weeks of the time of
the House, and the previous question was
ordered. By unanimous consent, in order
that there might be no misunderstanding,
and at the request of Dingley, the vote
was taken on the question : â¢
"Shall the House concur in the Senate
amendment?" .

The hour of 5 o'clock having arrived the
House, under the rule, took a recess until.
8 o'clock, the evening session to be for
the consideration of private pension bills
only.
The attendance of the evening session
was unusually large, a division upon a dis
puted point showing the presence of 116
members. Matters moved along smoothly
for an hour or so when there were signs of a
personal controversy between Talbert (D.)
of ' South Carolina and - Hardy (R.) of â  In
diana.
* The former objected to a bill restoring a
pension to a widow which she -. had for
feited by remarryingâ case similar., to
scores of others which " come before i Con

ently opposed bills to restore ; pensions > in

feet, despite the efforts ,of several gentle
men to induce him to let ' the incident

tones, "has . made ; trouble .;. in the ;. United

r This outbreak failed to disturb Talbert's
good nature and his only response was, "I
do not intend to notice what has just been
said, but rise merely to suggest that Can
ada (Hardy's native country) having been
heard from, we have a vote." [Applause.]
: In the very next case considered by the
committee Talbert won hearty applause
from the Republicans by remarking in } a
speech in support of the bill: "It â is * not
always or often you find the old veterans
who met each other in the red blaze of
war fighting it over again thirty years
after the conflict is over. Those who in
dulge themselves in this way are gener
ally those who, while invincible in peace
are invisible in war."
The committee acted favorably on ten
bills which at 10:10 were reported to the
House by Chairman Hepburn, and five
bills previously reported ' were passed.
When the bill to pension-Hannah Wright
was reported General Curtis (R.) of New
York asked unaninlous consent to with
draw it, briefly stating that the rooming
after favorable action had been taken by
the committee of the whole he ' had re
ceived word that the old lady had died.
At 10:25 o'clock the House finding itself
without a quorum adjourned until to
morrow. â  . * â¢f. '' A;

However complete : the two. cases may be
found, it is still likely, that experts sent
abroad by the commission may be able to
develop important documents which will
at least throw valuable side lights on the
controversy, and the idea that it will be
necessary for the Secretary -and perhaps
some of the members to visit Europe has
not been abandoned.

MORE TALKING
THAN FIGHTING.
Maher's Eyes Grow Better
and the Big Mill May
Be Held.
MONDAY THE TIME SET.
Pugilists of the Lesser Fry Are
Yet Left on the Anxious
Seat.
DEMANDS FOR MONEY BEFTTSED.
Those Who Have Tickets Will Have
... to Hold Them Regardless of
Postponements.
EL PASO, Tex., Feb. 14.â Maher's eyes
are improving rapidly, and the prospects
for a fight Monday are good. At 8 o'clock
to-night Dr. Albers held a conversation
over the telephone with Quinn, who is
Maher's backer, and who is now with the
pugilist at Las; Cruces. On Quinn's
assurance that Maher's eyes were greatly
im Droved, and if the favorable conditions
continued he would agree to the fight next
Monday, bulletins to the effect,'; that
Maher would be ready to go into the ring
on Monday next were posted, and for the
first time in a week, Dan Stuart's face has
been illuminated with a smile. The pros
pects now are that the Fitzsimmons "fight
will take place Monday. .
Referee Silver stated to-night that Wol
cott will weigh in to-morrow, and j this is
believed to be a precautionary measure to
save the forfeit-money. Collins is ex
pected to weigh in some time during the
day. There was a considerable thinning
out of ugly tempered and disgusted sports
to-day. More are going on the morning
and evening trains of Saturday, and the
prospects are that the crowd at the ring
side on Monday, provided Maher is in
condition to get within the ropes, will be
composed in the main of the local frater
nity. y.yv'..; 0 'AA
The promoters continue to insist that
the size of the crowd is a secondary con
sideration, and that the "chief point is to
get the men together, but they wax indig
nant when it is suggested that this means r
more of an exhibition for the benefit of
the kinetoscope than a straight out con
test for the world's championship. -
On the question of the minor contests
that were to round out the carnival the
managers continue to manifest a reticence
| that is galling to George Dixon,' Marshall,
Wolcott, Leeds, Everhard and the re
mainder of the secondary fry that have
been dropping into the office at frequent
! intervals with the view to finding out just
where they stood.
A number of the visiting sports would
willingly have remained g)ver a few days'
bad the promoters been witling: to put on
some of the middle or light-weights, and it
has been put bluntly to them ' by scores of
individuals here from distant [ points and
who are as much out of pocket as they are
out of temper ttoat if the proposed battle
ground is as inaccessible to the Mexican
troops and without violating international
comity, as they have all along claimed, it
would be an easy matter to pull off the
Dixon-Marshall or Leeds-Everhard con
test to-morrow, so as to show that they
mean business and are acting in good faith
toward the small fry. To these represen
tations there has been up to dusk but one
| reply: â 
"We intend to pull off the big fight first
i and then we will see what we can do with
1 ii 3 other fellows." This evening, how
ever, the pressure both from townspeople
and visitors became so strong that it was
given out officially that if Maher was still
unable to tight on Monday or Tuesday the
Dixon-Marshall and Everhard-Leeds fights
would be put on for those days, but that
the battle ground or grounds would not be
the same as selected for the principal
contest.
Word came this evening by telephone
from Las Cruces to Buck Connelly that
under the treatment prescribed [by : Dr.
.White Maher's eyes had considerably im
proved during the day and that the local
doctor was confident of having him in
shape Monday or Tuesday. Before going
to Las Cruces on the train Connelly said:
"We shall ask another; postponement if
Maher cannot see well enough on Monday,
and. if it is refused then the other people
can take the forfeit. 1 believe that â¢ they
will be willing to wait a while longer, if it
is necessary. They came down here for a
purse and not for a forfeit i that trill be
barely sufficient to see them home, and if
they are so sure of winning, a matter of a
few days is not ; worth - considering. V; If
they won't consent then Iwe will take up
the proposition from the National | Sport
ing Club of London, but we are not willing
to go back on Stuart so long as there is an
earthly chance .of bringing the men
together under his auspices."
Fitzsimmons and Julian spent the greater
part of the day in town and took particu
lar pains to show themselves about the
streets and resorts, for the purpose of giv
ing the lie to the story that the Australian
had been notified to consider himself under
arrest whenever :he crossed â¢ tbe ;â  river to
Texas oilA:-^^^^^^^0jBSBK^^^M
There were no Rangers dogging his foot
steps, nor were there any indications that
Adjutant-General Mabry or the f local
authorities were concerned 'in either his
comings or his goings. ; Fitzsimmons is
considerably broke up ; over the postpone
ment of the fight. He has worked hard to
get himself in the condition he is now in
and says he does hot; know what effect a
wait ? might ; have -; on 1 his constitution.
Then, again, the strain to which his mind
has been wrought up through all the
rumors .that has been* set afloat may have
a disastrous effect on his nerves. He says
he Tis willing to wait â¢ until Monday, but
after that date he does not know what he
will do. , - " -
y, Parson :; Da vies, .; John L. 7 Sullivan and
Paddy Ryan and the remainder of his out
fit have decided â¢ to .leave ; to-night^ Sulli
van is responsible for the change of plans.
He is 3 sore and' ugly * over * the { postpone
ment, and says 'â :. that" he I does hot believe
that; another . championship - fight ; can [ be
brought off on â¢ '_ this side of 'â¢ the Atlantic
within the century yy A number of visitors
from Chicago, j New York, St. Louis and
other points who had purchased\ tickets
for the big fight before coming here called
"at headquarters to-day : with ; the view of
getting : a refunding ;,. before j leaving ,;'-â  for
home.; None of l them : received any satis
j faction. Secretary Wheelock explained
| that the affair had not been canceled, but
merely â¢ postponed ; that " the s tickets were
still good, and that he had no authority to
return any portion of the cash that had
been received. , ; . v ..,- A{y a r
â V. Later in the day Wheelock stated to The
United Press that if the fight was officially
declared off all money received for tickets
would be paid back, but that if there were
repeated postponements the tickets al
ready sold would hold good until the two
men were got together, whether it ibe in a
week or six months hence.
Passengers from Las Cruces report that
several others there are suffering from
sore eyes and â  that Peter Burns is in a
worse shape than Maber.

something like old times to the minds of
the? big crowd of * horsemen who fairly
crowded* the garden. Forty-lour bead
brought s39,B4o, or' an average of $885 a
head, before the sale was adjourned for
the; evening. After three or four horses,
the ; property -of various owners, had
been disposed of, the consignment from
the estate of the late John A. Goldsmith
was put up for sale. Venetia WilKes, 2:13,

Efforts , to t Ãring the Girl, Back to
Consciousness Were Made
in Vain.
CENTERVILLE, lowa, Feb. 14.â Mrs.
W. J. Martin and her daughter, Lea Mar
tin, aged 23, were killed at their home in
the suburbs of this town at 8 o'clock this
evening by George Jones, who afterward
killed himself. There is mystery sur
rounding the affair. Jones has been for a
long time a lover of the girl. Both are of
good families, and there was no reason
for the belief that there had been trouble.
This evening Jones wentout to the home
of the Martins andcwas last seen as he left
the streetcar. Half an hour later the
tragedy occurred. There was nobody in
the house when Jones went there but the
girl and her mother. The five shots that
were fired called in the neighbors, who
found Mrs. Martin and her daughter on
the floor of the parlor.
Mrs. Martin was dead and Lea dying.
The girl had a bullet-hole in her neck and
was bleeding profusely. The mother was
shot in the forehead and also in the
breast, and bad' been killed instantly by
the shot in the head.
Jones appears to have gone to the house
and after shooting tbe two women went
outside, crossed the street and shot him
self before the neighbors came. He has a
bullet from his 38-caliber revolver in his
brain and had died instantly. When he
was found his heart had hardly ceased
beating.
Lea is still alive, but losing strength fast
and cannot possibly live. Every effort
has been made to bring her back to con
sciousness, so that she might tell some
thing of the tragedy, but it will avail
nothing.
W. J. Martin, the husband and father,
is a doctor and Coroner of Ap
pannooz County. He had no family
except the daughter and wife, and was
away from home, whÂ»-n the tragedy oc
curred. He is prostrated by the shock and
very sick, although not in danger.

Lesser Statesmen Back Up the State
ments Made by Prime Minister
Salisbury.
LONDON, Esq., Feb. 14.â 1n the Honse
of Commons this evening Sir William
Harcourt, leader of the opposition, re
ferred to the conflicting statements made
by Baron Marschal yon Beiberstein, Ger
man Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Lord
Salisbury, Prime Minister and Secretary
for Foreign Affairs of Great Britain, in
regard to the troubles in South Africa.
Lord Salisbury, 'he said, had alleged that
the Government of the South African re
public had made application to European
powers for their support, and the powers
had denied that they had received any
such appeal: This question, Sir William
asserted/affected the whole of the rela
tions of England in South Africa with
Germany. Any one, he said, "who would
contribute to the cultivation of ill feeling
between Great Britain and Germany was
no friend to the peace of the world. The
fact still remained undisclosed, he said,
by whose authority Dr. Jameson had
acted.
In regard io the hitch in the negotia
tions with the South African republic he
understood that the people of the Trans
vaal wanted to settle their own affairs. In
. the circumstances he thought the inter
vention of Mr. Chamberlain, conducted in
the most delicate manner, would not im
prove matters. The best way out of the
difficulty would be to have President
Krueger come to London and settle every
thing at once.
A. J. Balfour, First Lord of the Treas
ury, said Lord Salisbury's statement was
based upon positive assurances received
from Sir J. A. Dewet which was put in
language the only possible interpretation
of which was that an appeal had been
made by the Transvaal Government for
the support of Germany.
Mr. Balfour defended the course taken
by Mr. Chamberlain in introducing an im
reriai factor into the affair, and main
tained that his action had been alike ap
proved by the English and Dutch popula
tion of the Transvaal; that plan or I
something like it, 'he declared, ' must be
adopted if the Boer Government was to be j
carried on for any length of time. If the 1
English population in the Transvaal in- '
creased in the time to come, Boers could \
not maintain an uncontrolled Govern- i
ment. He was convinced that if President
Krueger should come to England a method
would be found for the solution of the
difficulty. BBS
Henry Labouchere, the radical leader,
withdrew the amendment to the address
in reply to the Queen's speech offered by
him yesterday, to the effect that, the in
quiry into Dr. Jameson's raid in the
Transvaal ought to include an investiga
tion into the financial and political actions
of the British South Africa Company.
Mr. Timothy Harrington (Parnellite),
member for the Harbor Division of Dub
lin, moved an amendment to the address
in favor ol the release of the Irish political
prisoners.
Mr. Michael Davitt (anti - Parnellite),
member for South Mayo, declared that
the punishment inflicted on these prison
ers was brutally excessive, and that their
treatment was without parallel in modern
history. â¢
Sir Matthew White Ridley, the Home
Secretary, denied that the Irish political
prisoners were treated differently than
other prisoners. There was no special
reason why more indulgence should be
granted. to these men than to non-political
prisoners. These cases would, however,
be considered shortly, and he would gladly
avail himself of any considerations tend
ing to show that there should be a mitiga
tion of their sentence.

"His Imperial Majesty, my sovereign,
has been pleased to signify his high ap

Majesty values greatly the manifestation
of those sentiments of good will to which
your husband, in his high office of Secre

expression whenever suitable opportunity
offered, and has been graciously pleased
also to signify his appreciation of the amia
ble and . helpful intercourse which the

the representative of Japan.
" "As a token of this feeling of apprecia

manded, through his excellency, the Min

roll of Gobelin tapestry and a pair of
enamel vases should be presented to you.
These articles are from among the valued
possessions of his Majesty the Emperor,

[Reproduced from a photograplj]*
will be an outspoken report, in which
spades and other things will be called by
their right 'names, but there will be no
! mention in it of the death of little Mary
Harris at the fountain Grove community.
| .The sensational, features of that tragedy
; have all been exhausted, and no well-mi
i formed person believes that there is any
i ground upon which to base a criminal
| accusation against any member of the
colony.
Those in j this city who are : personally
acquainted with Thomas Lake Harris, the
j community's founder and its primate,
speak in the highest terms of him. Judge
j Temple is his friend, arid was one of the
I signers of a document which declared as
| vicious and false the accusations brought
against Harris by Miss Chevalier about
; three years ago. But since then Harris
has resided in New York,. living in quiet
with his wife and a few congenial friends
in a handsome house on Upper Broadway,
; and enjoying the society and confidence of
! intellectual and thoughtful men. among
j them William Dean Howells, and during
his absence Fountain Grove has been un
l der the "management of- the Japanese
Kanai Nagasawa.
. Perhaps in former days Nagasawa had
â  dreams and visions of higher things than
j commercial prosperity, but to all appear-
I ances those . dreams and visions have
j passed now and the primate is a busi
! ness manâ a -good one, perhaps, but only
! that. Certainly Fountain Grove has pros
! pered in a financial way under his man-'
i agement and its wines and fruits are fa
! mous, but to all external appearances the
; Grove is now spiritually and esthetically
; dead. -It looks commonplace. The
! grounds are not picturesque and â¢ the un
productive parts are not cared for. Foun
tain Grove ' is a business proposition to
day, and doubtless its little,' shrewd-faced,
black-eyed manager does not regret the
free advertising it has been getting. . It
was, however, a sorry home for a bright,
sensitive, sympathetic girl of 16 summers,
with neither parent, sister nor friend in
which -to confide her hopes, her fears, her
joys. Indeed, of ! joys she had none, and
eventually hope left her, so secure was her
imprisonment, so harsh and restrictive ap
pears to have been her treatment.
! : However, it is ;no crime to â  break a girl's .
; heart; "and then, again, there may be even
| another side to this story, for most stories
I are two-sided.
: " "We investigated the matter very care
fully, I think," said B. M. Spencer, fore
man of the Grand Jury, . to-day, "and we
are satisfied^ that , we have not warrant
sufficient to even ; censure the Fountain
Grove people in the matter of "the death of
Mary Harris. My A- own /opinion is i that
they were .too' strict ; and rigid in their
treatment of the } girl; but even that is
merely an opinion, and I could not; state
it as a fact. The Grand Jury will make no
report in the matter whatever. -A Its mem
bers do not "entertain any A suspicions
against the inmates."
': One thing' that will surely tend to in
crease the hostility of the outer world, or
as much of it as pays any attention to the
matter, against the Grove management is
the fact that all the white 'employes at the
community are being, replaced by Japan
ese. ; Still, this is not â¢ a very : sensational
thing in itself, seeing that the manager is
himself a native born > Japanese. It may
be, as some claim, that - Nagasawa's chief
object in employing only Japanese : labor
is to preserve a greater secrecy concerning
the affairs at the Grove. -'" Indeed ; Nagaa
wa's own attitude corrbnarates this view
to some extent. * .V.i .-.*,. "â ]
_. : . To-day Va ? Call y correspondent went out
! to the Grove and sought an interview with
| the vice-primate. This he^irmly declined : ,
saying that "silence ; is .: power." * One of
the newspapers had . misrepresented and
misquoted him, he said, and : in *' future he
would ' make no â¢ statement \ whatever ~ for
publication. -.â¢'â '. The 'â ':". people y of A Sonoma
County who knew him did not believe '* all
the wild \- rumors in circulation; he de
clared, and for the ; opinion of those who
did not know him he did not care.
.; Nagasawa is short, stout and phlegmatic.
He has a face that is neither good nor bad ;
but;' it is certainly not the face' of -an
ascetic rather one of the man who counts
his money carefully. He is reputed to be
worth over $1,000,000. : - '

ANGELS CAMP, Cal., Feb. 14.â The
Central Hill, located at Douglas Flat, the

county, has been closed down by order of
Captain Gillette,; the Government engi
neer. It is thought â  that some technical

that the owners will be able to arrange for
the immediate resumption of hydraulick
ing. y Meantime they are sluicing.
The mine is sixty miles from navigation,
and | there is no testimony^ to \ show that
any injury has been done. Although com
paratively poor, men, the three owners
have expended years of labor in running a
tunnel and building flumes and dams, and
this was the first time they were , equipped
for a full season's work. The stoppage of
the mine even temporarily entails a large
loss, as the water season is short, and it is
considered a great injustice by our people.

New Arrivals Which Are Distracting
Attention From \ the Schools
of Salmon.
;- SANTA CRUZ, Cal.. Feb. 14.â A whale
was killed in Monterey Bay to-day, and
500 salmon were taken. The excitement
of killing a whale and capturing the fish
was enhanced by the appearance at the
outer edge, of .the bay of a number
of seals that bad followed the whales
that have y been here - for several
days in numbers y ranging from a
dozen to twenty. One of the boats re
turning from the scene of the whaling in
cident was followed # by a thrasher shark.
The wha-le had become entangled in some
sea-bass nets set . about half < way. between
here and Capitola last night. .It is be
lieved by the fishermen that thrasher
sharks had attacked. the whale, and in its
efforts to escape it. had become fast in the
nets, The nets belonged to W. D. Gore of
Capitola, and, claiming, the whale as his
property, he . proceeded with his men to
take the big fellow out.
A long piece of gasoipe, with a sharp,
pointed end, was loaded in the point with
dynamite." The hide of the whale was
opened with a knife and the pipe driven
into its body. Then the explosive was
touched off, and the big fish sank to the
bottom of the bay. ; It will . rise within a
few days, when the , captors will tow â¢ the
carcass in and secure the oil. The whale
was forty-seven feet long, and - will yield
about twenty barrels of oil. This will not
pay for the nets destroyed, they being
worth about $100. y- y
There has 1 been .; much excitement here
over the incident, and that, with the fact
that the seals were seen, has drawn the at
tention of some of the local fishermen from
the salmon, * but the visitors coming in
from San Francisco and other cities and
towns will, keep alive that sport. The
beach was crowded to-day with visitors,
who had been attracted by the story of, the
seal and the whale, but the latter were too
far away to be seen from any point on
shore.
Salmon. can now. be taken easily with a
trolling line, and that is a favorite method.
There will.be a great many boats out to- '
morrow with trailers. There is no doubt '
of .the presence along the coast, between
here arid New Year's Island, of large num
bers of seal, as shown by the. big catch
made by the Eppinger, which left this
harbor on Tuesday afternoon to return to
the seal grounds. That boat had on board
over 400 skins, and reported sealing in that
region as being very good. â  ";
A WARSIJVG FROM REDLAXDS.
Republicans Urged to Keep Clear of San
Francisco Bosses/
â  ; REDLANDS. Cal., Feb. 14.â Under the
heading of ''Republicans, be Careful," the
Citrograph will to-morrow publish the
following editorial: '
To-Cay, in Sao Francisco, the executive com
mittee of the Republican State Central Com
mittee meets to prepare a call - for the State
convention which will select delegates to the
National Convention. From the dispatches it
would seem that there is' likely- to be a row
over the basis 'Â« of apportionment. One '6is
patch says:.
"It is understood the country members
of the State Central Committee will make a
dead set against the City, and that San Fran
cisco will be shorn of a Rood deal of its power
in the convention. :. If the Estee vote is taken
as a basis of the apportionment, the representa
tion to be -one delegate for each 150 votes, San
Francisco- will have but 138 delegates, while
on the Harrison vote she will have 164."-' : .
At the last election the basis of representa
tion was the vote cast for Bard for Presidential
elector, and* not the : vote cast for : Markham
four years previously. â¢ San Francisco politi
cians do not like the idea of placing the repre
sentation, on the basis of; the Fstee vote, as,
after 'â  having : forced his nomination =' on the
people,' that City failed to cast as many Repub
lican votes Dy 3801 as she did in the Harrison
campaign. .-.'â¢- ;
Let the interior fight shy of any alliance
with the Republican bosses of San Francisco
who led tbe party to defeat in the last cam
paign.' Stand for right and stand together and
the Republican party will be victorious. Stand
in with the corrupt bosses and the people will
see to it that certain defeat is your portion. <^

i When this road is extended, as it will be,
"to Trinidad", Klamath and finally; to Cres
cent City, it will bring an immense r traffic
to Eureka. The shipping,' : however, will
have to be done from the Samoa side of the
bay on account of the great depth of water
in that "channel/. When completed, 'A' the

along the Little, Klamath and Smith
rivers to Humboldt Bay for shipment. Â
* This is the only harbor ; along T the ; coast
where vessels can \ safely i load - lumber .â  in
rough weather, and since this road will
tap the pine timber belt north of here, as

PROPERTY LOST
TO THE STATE.
Belongings of the Bureau
of Silk Culture Have
Disappeared.
CANNOT BE LOCATED.
Secretary Brown's Search for the
Missing Articles Ends in
Failure.
CASE OF DELIBERATE THEFT.
Examiners Are Urged to Make Every
Possible Effort to Fix the
Responsibility.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 14.âSecre
tary of Stare Lewis H. Brown,. in the
course of the systematic investigation of
State affairs, institutions and commissions
in which he has been engaged, for some
time, has uncovered a steal of large pro
portions. In a report which he to-day
submitted to the Board of Examiners he
declares that of all the property supplied
to the State Board of Silk .Culture, or of
the purchase by that board, not a single
article can be discovered. Moreover, not
one clew to the location of any of the
property can be secured, and Secretary
Brown urges that the State take drastic
measures to recover its loss or to punish
those whose duty it was to care for the
board'? appurtenances and paraphernalia.
Says the report:
"Pursuant to -your instructions, I pro
ceeded to ascertain the whereabouts of the
property purchased during the existence
of the State Board of Silk Culture. -Here
with will be found the correspondence and
a list of furniture, machinery, etc.,
purchased by said board.
"After much research, in different direc
tions, I was unable to locate anything be
longing to said board, nor could informa
tion be obtained from the proper source
with the exception of a few pieces of
machinery stored in different parts of the
Flood building where it had been rusting
for several years. Storage had .been de
manded of parties who were sent to look
at the machinery, but we have been prom
ised that no charge would be made. No
clew whatever could be obtained as to
what became of the carpets, rugs, chairs,
mirrors, stoves, desks, lounges, fancy
chairs, scales, etc. In fact all the furni
ture and movables have disappeared
and where no one knows.
'.'This. is the first investigation in look
ing up State property that has ever been
made by the board, and the result is ap
parent to the dullest mind that the prop
erty has simply been appropriated. It is
as great a loss to the people to have State
property, which is necessary and must be
replaced, stolen or destroyed, as it is to
take the actual coin from ..the State treas
ury. I candidly believe that many thous
ands of dollars' worth of movable property
purchased by the State has disappeared
and never will be recovered. That knowl
edge may be had of what property the
State has lost I respectfully suggest that
a comparison of the purchases for the past
ten years be made with the inventory
which was recently taken, and if any dis
crepancy ; be discovered that an effort be
made by this board to fix the responsibility
upon the proper parties.
"Responsibility should rest upon some
one, and if officials have been careless in
protecting property placed in their keep
ing, they should be liable for the loss of
the same. The property ofÂ» the State
should be as safely and zealously guarded
as that of an individual."

LOS ANGELES ROMANCE
Jesse Hunter Sues His Ex- Wife
to Annul Deeds to His
Property.
She Had Lived in Bigamy for Years,
Unknown to Her Second
Husband. ,.... .
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. Jesse
Hunter to-day commenced a suit against
the woman who was once his wife, to set
aside a deed to about $50,000 worth of prop
erty. Hunter, after he had lived with the
woman a number of years, found that her
first husband was still living and that she
had. never been divorced from him. He
thereupon cast her off, and she brought
suit for divorce, which 1 was determined in
her favor. : â¢> /
In : the complaint to-day Hunter gives
the history of the romantic separation of
his wife and himself. It is s,hown that
they were married ; on July 3, 1862, al
though the venerable plaintiff calls the
ceremony a pretended marriage. - He avers
that he believed Joseph Milam, her first
husband, was dead, but that Mrs. Milam
knew that he was alive when she married
the complainant. He alleges that in 1878
he was so sick that his physician advised
him that he was going to die, and under
that condition of affairs his wife persuaded
him to deed to her his valuable, property.
But instead of dying he got well. l. â¢' ,
Hunter 'states. that bis wife confessed to
him in 1883- that her former husband was
still living, although she claimed she had
not known it to a certainty until about
that time. Their separation followed.
After the divorce was procured there
was a consultation about the property. In
order to make some provision for his ex
wife Hunter proposed to give her a second
deed, under the name of Milam, if she
would agree not to try to claim it under
the first deed. He alleges that Mrs. Milam |
agreed to this arrangement, and in pur- j
suance of the understanding he gave her a
second deed. Mrs. Milam, he now as
serts, in violation of that agreement, is
trying to assert her claim to the property
in question by the . first deed. For these
reasons he wants the deeds annulled.

The Loss of a Favorite Daughter Led
to Despondency and Consequent
111 Health.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Feb. 14.-I. Alexander,
who has been associated with: his son in a
cigar-store at 146 South First street, com* 1
mitted suicide during last night by hang
ing himself in a shed in the rear of the
store. Â« -:' . _A-\ " "
Since the death of a favorite daughter in
Oakland a few years ago Alexander- has
been failing in health and despondent,
and during the past few weeks has . made
numerous threats to end his life. Three
weeks ago he made an attempt to commit
suicide by the inhalation of gas, but failed,
and a week ago when his store was opened
he was found sitting in a chair suffering
from a dose of morphine. He was given a
stimulant and recovered.
Alexander had been closely watched by
his relatives. However, he eluded them,
and as soon -as he closed the cigar-store
about 11 o'clock last night he deliberately
prepared to end his life. Standing on a
chair he fastened the rope to a beam over
his head and then kicked the chair away.
He had removed his coat, vest and hat,
and they were found on a card table in a
rear room.
When R. McFarland, a clerk, opened the
store this morning he discovered the body
of Alexander hanging from the rafter, and
at once notified Coroner Secord, who had
the body removed to the Morgue. An in
quest was held this afternoon and the jury
returned a verdict of suicide while suffjr
ing from aberration of the mind.
Mr. Alexander was well known in Oak
land, and for a number of years conducted
a shoestore at the corner of Seventh and
â Washington streets. For the past year he
had been very morose and several months
ago his relatives encouraged him to come
to Bah Jose, where three of his children,
George W. Alexander, Mrs. E. M. Rosen
thal .and Csesar Alexander, resided. Ha
purchased the cigar-store on South First
street; for his son, Caesar Alexander, and
had been helping the latter conduct the
business. = Alexander owned [ considerable
property in Oakland, r where | his widow,
now resides. V â¢â  -"". ,A'.y'i :-;,â'
The suicide was a native of Prussia and
70 years of age. He had been a resident of
California for about fsriyyears. His body
was shipped to Oakland this afternoon.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 14.â 1. Alexan
der, was a well-known merchant of this
city. He came to California in 1858 from
New York and opened a shoestore in Oak
land. He retired from business about ten
years ago. For - some years he has been
regarded as an eccentric man and one of
his peculiarities was that of incessant
reading. He Would lock himself in his
room for hours and not permit any one to
disturb him. 'When he came down to
meals he would maintain silence, and it is
said that he had not spoken to some mem
bers of his family for some years, although
residing in the same house.
Mr. Alexander was a member of the In
dependent Order of B'nai B'rith, and the
widow will receive $2000 from that order.

ticular care to point out the bill's j defects
and pronounces it a fraud! ~ ' V. ' .
The Gazette (Dem.), the leading paper of
Arizona, pronounces it a bald-faced job
and to-morrow morning will : : say editori
ally: "The Murphy school land bill and
the Peralta grant are twin sisters in in

Territorial prison at Santa Fe, N. Mex.,
and the other is fixing himself for a long
period of poltical exile, taking with him in
his forced retirement the well-earned con
tempt of the citizens of Arizona."
Other citizens, fully as prominent, are of
the same mind, and local politicians to-,

GOVERNOR BUDD NOT IDLE.

j "My recollection of \ the matter is that
Belshaw came into the office with a copy
of the resolution and statedlthat if it was
not immediately telegraphed to' Washin
gton it would be of no possible utility, as he
understood that Congress intended to take
immediate action on the Reilly funding bill.
I think the reason this made :so strong an
impression upon my mind was that I have
always been an ardent advocate of the
ownership by the Government of a trans
continental railroad between ' California

SCARED BY THE NOISE
They Hurriedly Departed After
the Money Was Within

EXPRESS PACKAGES STOLEN;
Two Suits of Clothing All That Was
Secured by the Frightened -
Robbers.
BELMONT, Cal. , Feb. Burglars
entered the Southern '; Pacific depot here
early yesterday morning and blew open
Wells, Fargo &â  Col's safe ; with giant
powder. Holes were drilled in : the back
of the ; safe and the â  cartridges inserted.
The explosion blew out the back of the safe,
leaving" the inner steel lining y torn to
shreds. The robbers seemingly became
alarmed by the noise of the explosion, as
they left $60 in the safe within easy reach.
Two new suits of clothing were 'stolen
from the Wells-Fargo express packages.
People residing , near the depot were
awakened at 2 o'clock in the morning by a
loud report and the ; breaking ,of glass. A
half dozen men ; arose : and went out onto
the streets to investigate, but, hearing or
seeing.nothing further, again retired. . The
robbery was not discovered until 7 o'clock,
when Wells, Fargo & Co.'s agent, J. J.
Maione, opened the office. He found the
back of the safe blown out, the windows of
the depot shattered and the walls badly
damaged. The burglars '. had entered by
â¢ the door in the waiting-room of the depot,
having broken a glass in; the door and
opened the night lock from the inside.
The V express office, which is in the South
ern Pacific Railroad ticket "office and I the
Western Union telegraph office combined,
was entered by the use of burglars' keys.
.: The robbers had brought ! blankets with
them to wrap around the safe to deaden
the sound of the explosion. v They left one
blanket, some fuse and the paper covering
to the sticks of j giant â  powder. It is be
lieved that the lighting of lamps in neigh
boring houses after, the giant powder was
touched off frightened the robbers away.
": This is the fourth time this" office has
been entered by burglars within less than
a ; year. Nine months ago Agent Maione
lost a revolver. Seven months ago the
office was entered through the ticket-office
window and a- hole bored into the back of
the safe, but nothing was taken. Five
months ago the office was entered through
a rear door and a Densmore typewriter
stolen. , . v :-/;,- â¢ .-' â¢ ys~ T \; " A. ..*;.:â -.'_'. . ' '

BOLD ROBBERY AT WATERFORD.
Two Masked Men and a Shotgun Relieve
a Stableman of $60. .
MODESTO, ; Cal., Feb., 14. "â A deci
dedly cool robbery took place at a livery
stable at Waterford, \ twelve miles east
of Modesto, this morning. The pro
prietor of the stage line between Modesto
and Coulterville, Thomas Smith, who stops
in the stable, was aroused, to find himself
looking into the barrels of a shotgun, held
by a man with a white handkerchief cov
ering his face. _ He was ordered to face the
wall, and robber No. 1 and another simi
larly masked ransacked the place, taking $60
from Smith's trousers. They left a watch
worth $200, saying they did not want it.
One of the men looked at it and said : "It's
1 o'clock, old man; good-by." There is

CHINESE FACTIONS.
There Is Promise of Renewed Trouble
in Chinatown. yy y',-
. The Sam Yup and See Yup companies
are again at outs. It was thought that the
opening of the Chinese New Year would
put at end to the difficulty, but last even
ing a row started between members of the
two companies in the Sam Yup theater at
525 Jackson street.
, , A number of See Yups were visiting the
theater, and the crowd became so large
that the passage-ways and entrances to
the theater became blockaded.-
Police Sergeant Wollweber in charge
of a posse attempted to clear the passage
ways, and in doing so it became necessary
to throw a number of . the See Yups down- '
stairs.
As soon as the See Yups reached the
sidewalks they were seized by members of
their own company and taken to the com
pany's headquarters, and were fined $1
each for visiting the theater kept by . the
opposition company.
. After this row had quieted down the See
Yups stationed , spies around Chinatown
and all of the members' of that company
caught purchasing goods in a store belong
ing to a Sam Yup man was seized, taken
to headquarters and fined $1 each.
It is feared that this : difficulty, coming
with the opening of the new year, will*re
sult in serious trouble.' , : >
READY TO MAKE THE TALK
Democratic Leaders Will --Be on
Hand at the Meeting
r , March 14. -.;...
Some Pertinent Rumors Regarding
the Several Locations of the
Various Factions.
The talkers of the local Democracy are
beginning to train their vocal chords for a
long stiff talk to the Central Committee,
which is to meet* at the California Hotel
March 14, Saturday afternoon, with Frank
Gould in the chair, and a dozen or more
leaders clamoring for attention. -;*>.;
. The ever j pure and alabaster Junta,
which does business under th<= white flag
of peace ana holds its head high above the
debris of the ruined and depraved Buck
leyites, will stand up and give forth
mighty blows .to the impure opposition.
There will be a loud clamoring for recogni
tion and the chairman will. have a hard
time keeping some of the devoteu from
sacrificing themselves on the altar of party
principle. The Junta, so it is claimed, will
be there with its star talkers waeihg relent
less war against, the bolters and slaves of
the political bandits, who have sold out the
party three times, and are now negotiating
for a holiday clearance sale with knock
.down prices in every department. . '" {
The Junta will plead with reason and
eloquence for recognition, and point with
quivering finger at the stained escutcheons
of Rainey and Buckley. There will in all
probability be a howl for those amputated
wings that were bo serreptitiously removed
â¢ from the angel on the City Hall so that
they may be nailed on the Flood building
as a symbol of the attitude of the Junta
toward the Democratic party. r ' .
On the other hand toe ; Buckley and
Rainey forces will sweep down. from the
Occidental Club and the Fire Department
and put their fists under the nose of the
chairman and demand a hearing before the
minutes of the previous meeting are read.
The laws of parliamentary procedure will
in all probability be disregarded, and Jim
O'Brien is said j to be preparing a speech
calculated to pull back the curtain of next
week and â¢ permit the State Central Com
mittee to gaze â on the perfidious faces of
the Junta household. It is said that he
will give ; the Buckley whoop on opening
and closing his remarks just to show that
he still belongs to the tribe and' can throw
a verbal tomahawk as far as' he. can see
Gavin McNab. \ It is evidently thought by
some' that Chairman .Gould will recognize
the man with the best lungs and longest
wind. . . ; lAyAyyy'A i â¢
There is yet another story, that Buckley
is sick with bronchitis at the farm and
that : he is quite contented to \ stay away
and - let , the . lambs gambol on the green
sward of the State Committee until they
break their: necks. â¢ One ,* Democrat says
Chris is pretty well satisfied that the day
of his reign is past and that he is willing
to see the cracked crown fall on the head
of â¢' some one [ else who will be contented
with the' shelf-worn and worthless bauble.
J All of these rumors have a certain
political value, but when the Central Com
mittee gets ready to hear : the ;! arguments
pro and con there will be a scene seldom
if ever witnessed !in the California Hotel.
The Buckley people are just as sure of their
strength as the Junta people, . and it is
whispered \. that Chris will suddenly get
well a few days before ; the row begins and

Climax of the Quarrel Arising
-..*"' From the Charges Against
Inspectors.
WILLIAMS CASE CONTINUED.
Location of the Slave Mart in China
town Where Young Girls Are
. Bought and Sold.
Wars and rumors of wars still permeate
the Custom-house. As a result of the con
flict now on between Special Agent of the
Treasury Moore and Collector of the Port
Wise blows were said to have been struck
The Slave Mart at 812 Jackson Street, Where Chinese Girls Are Held Until Sold j
/ to the Highest Bidders.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
yesterday. Moore is said to have got the
best of it, but as the affair took place in
the Collector's private sanctum there are
only two witnesses to the incident. Mr.
Wise tells one story and the special agent
.another. Both deny that there was any
difficulty, but nevertheless they admit the
meeting broke up in a hurry.
Collector Wise has a habit of emphasiz
ing his statements by tapping the listener
over the heart. Each word means a tap.
Moore objected to these taps and the dis
cussion suddenly ceased, leaving the ques
tion of landing Chinese and the guilt or
innocence ot 11. Williams in abeyance. It
is said there was a "biff, bang," after
-which followed an adjournment.
Just who got the better of the contest
â¢will never be known, as both sides refuse
to talk. One thing is certain, the investi
gation into the charges against Inspector
Williams was postponed indefinately, and
it may be weeks before the Collector and the
special agent of the treasury will be able
to adjust their differences and arrange a
'suitable date.
"There was a difference between Special
Agent Moore and I," said Collector Wise,
"but if you want the particulars go to Mr.
.Moore."
"As a result of the difference there was a
â¢postponement of the investigation, was
.there not?"
â¢ "Weil, yes; there was," answered the
Collector, "but I don't know whether that
is anybody's business or not. You go and
see Special Agent Moore; he can give you
all the information you want, but really I
know nothing."
, "The investigation has not really be
gun," said the Collector, "but the rule that
â was followed in the case of Mr. Noyes will
be followed in that of Mr. Williams. If
you want any information in the matter,
however, go to Mr. Moore."
This advice was accepted.
' "Collector Wise and 1 had a meeting this
afternoon," said Special -Agent Moore, "to
discuss the manner in which the investi
gation should be carried on. We had dif
ferent opinions and : a little argument fol
lowed, and the result is that the investiga
tion was postponed. Collector. Wise and I
are the best of friends ' and ;we are both
Working in the interest of the Federal
Government. ' The investigation, however,
will eventually talce place' and the guilty
parties, if there be any, will be brought to
justice."
: Asked the cause of the sudden adjourn
ment of the investigation of the case
against Williams, the special agent said:
"See Collector Wise."
As a result of the quarrel between Col
lector Wise and Special Agent' Moore ana
the several rapid moves that followed on
the Custom-house chessboard, the hearing
of the case against Interpreter Williams
was continued. Williams is accused of
aiding in the unlawful landing of Chinese
slave girls at the port of San Francisco.
Special Agent Moore makes the charges
against ; him. They _ are/ ; based upon the
sayings of certain "Chinese, who are more
or less engaged in bringing : Chinese girls
to the United States and holding them as
slaves for immoral purposes.
The fact that young and innocent girls
from the far-away Celestial Empire have
been landed unlawfully here through "the
instrumentality of tbe Custom-house. ring
has been pretty thoroughly established -by
the secret agents of the Government.
These girls are induced to leave their na
tive land under - misrepresentation. They
am* their parents are . given to understand
that peace, happiness and plenty await |
them here. .They find themselves auc
tioned off as slaves to the dive-keepers in
Chinatown.
And this is the crime which certain
servants of the United States Government
at the * port of ] San Francisco are accused
of sanctioning â¢ for coin. They will be
given, every opportunity to explain their
connection with' the landing of a number
of girls within the last three months.
There was much bustle about the third i
floor of the big gray building on Battery
street yesterday: It was all occasioned by
the expected examination of Dick Wil
liams. The accused was there in all his
glory. '
He was attended by a retinue of Chinese
of high and low degree, all ready to bear
: witness in his favor and against the other
j fellow. They, were arrayed in the gay.
| colors peculiar to the Chinese holiday sea
i son, and even Lyman I. Mowry, who ha^
j been retained to defend William 3in all
the splendor and pink of judicial fashion,
. was less gorgeous than one of these.
Collector Wise came out of his' private
office looking every inch the grand old
man his friends declare him to be, and dis
missed the horde of Celestials with a wave
of the hand, saying that they would not
be needed until Monday. Then turning
to Williams he said :
"Hello, Dick! Don't go away; I want
to see you." And a few minutes later the
Collector, Williams and Mowry put their
heads together in the private office of the
bead of the department. This was after |
the interview with Major Moore; the inter
view that terminated so unceremoniously.
Moore kept closely to his private apart
| ments on the first floor of the Federal
; building during the afternoon. He even
kept the outside door locked and would not j
. see those friendly to i him. It was said by I
a wise follower that he was nursing his
wound.
Meanwhile the Special Agents of the
Government are continuing to hunt up
evidence against the accused inspectors.
Even the slave mart at 812 Jackson
street, where the Chinese girls are bought
and sold, has been located. It is there
that the women are taken when they are
landed from the Chinese steamers, and
there they are held until sold as mistresses
or as slaves to the proprietors of dens.
The girls who were recently landed on
fraudulent certificates and flimsy evidence
were held at the mart until disposed of.
They were young and pretty, however,
and found ready purchasers.
PITTED TOE CHINESE USES,
A History of the Late War as Told by
thÂ»' Man darn is.
History is specially written for the Chin
ese people by the Chinese authorities.
The following, which is the latest gem; re
lates to the affairs consequent upon the
cession of Formosa to Japan. It comes on
the authority of the Fenchau-fu' (Shansi)
correspondent of the North China Daily
News, who says that the document is be
ing industriously circulated in the cities of
the province at 10 cents per set, illustrated :
"The armies of China and Japan fought
until the third month (of the present year).
After peace had been declared, China
banded Formosa over to Japan. Unex
pectedly, the Formosanc did not want to
be handed, over. The Japanese went
here , and their soldiers attacked them
rom the fourth month till the last of the
first month. Formosa's commander-in
chief, Liu,' fought more than thirty bat
tles. ','......
"In a word, the Japanese did not win a
single battle, but, first and lan, by a strat
egy, General Liv killed 30,000 Japanese
soldiers and destroyed : some thirty odd
iron battle-ships and captured some twenty
odd. Afterward Japan sought help from
Western nationsâ English, French, Amer
ican and Russian. Each country re
sponded favorably the sixth day of the
second fifth month. Each country and
Japan had thirty, iron battle-ships and
thirty or forty wooden ones. They were
all filled with bravesâ Bo,ooo or 90,000 and
more. They went to Taipehfu and An
ningkou and fought a battle. General
Liv, by the use of strategy,' began to con
test sixty h outside of Anpingkou, in the
sea, on the 6th of the month, m the even

"Suddenly. fire started upon the surface
of the water. The foreigners made up
their minds that they, wanted to; set sail
and depart. But General Liu's marine un
der,the water bound fast all the ships with
iron chains, so that they oou'd not stir-
On the 7th of the month the fire ceased,
for the foreign ships and the soldiers. were
all burned* up. This battle was like the
ancient 'red wall off fire" battle. Imme
diately every foreign nation feared Gen-'
eral Liv as one does a tiger. On the Bth
and 9th of the month General Liu's braves
took ten iron battle-ships; 30,000 or 40,000
aborigines, ; 10,000 odd Black; Fla-s and
attacked Japan.' They, immediately cap- j
tured'Changchikon.-.Taipefu, Makuantao '

THE SAN FRANCISCO - CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1896.
LABOR TO WAR
WITH BALLOTS
Great Mass-Meeting of the
Prominent Wagework
ers' Unions.
ORGANIZE FOR ACTION.
Their Object Said to Be the
Election of Men Who Will j
Represent Them.
TWENTY-ONE BODIES IN LINE.
After a Four-Hour Session They Ad
journ Until To-Morrow to Per
fect Their Plans.
There was a most generous response last
night to the call of the Labor Council
issued about a month ago for a mass
meeting of all the labor organizations of
San Francisco. The call was as follows:
â¢ There is a noticeable and regretable lack of
public interest being manifested by the organ
ized workers of San Francisco in matters per- j
taining to the labor and reform movement.
Now, this apathy is unworthy of us. We are
numerous enough; we have 'cause and griev
ance enough, and we should have brains
enough to remedy this stagnation. Perhaps
we lack a knowledge of each other's wants,
hopes and plans. The plan of our unions j
teacnes us the benefit of concerted action and j
consultation.
In order that we may arrive at some unified
programme of action you are hereby invited i
and requested to be represented at a conven- i
tion of trade and labor organizations called to
meet at 1159 Mission street, Friday evening,
February 14, 1896, at 7:30 o'clock. We will
then have a full and free discussion of any and
all matters pertaining to the labor movement.
The representation will be based upon one
delegate for jour charter and one for each 100
members or a fraction thereof. â¢'
We sincerely trust that you will be with us,
Â«s the occasion and times certainly call for in
telligent and concerted action.
There were about 200 present when M.
-McGlynn, president of the Labor Council,
called the meeting to order.
T.F. Burns of the Cigar-makers' Union,
was elected temporary chairman and J. W.
Rose of the Painters' Union was chosen to

was then appointed: R. T. Mclver, Paint

tion was appointed by the chair as follows:
Myers, Ames, Stry beck, Stenson and But
ler. The committee report was adopted !
as follows: Election of officers, reading of

order to govern. - -"Vu
W. H. Hutchinson was elected perma
nent chairman of the convention, T. F.
Burns vice-president, J. W. Rose secretary
and J. McGowan, sergeant-at-arms, by
acclamation.
On motion the chairman appointed the
following committee of nine on resolutions
and declarations of principle: Myers, Mc-
Ivor, Bloom, Butler/Rosenberg, Rice.
Stenson, Schadt, J. J. Ryan.
The following resolution, presented by
the'Cigarrnakers' Union, was then read:
Whereas, The competitive system of industry
based primarily upon the individual owner
ship ol nature's unimodified resources, and
subsequently upon the individual ownership
of the tools of production, has, with the march
of Invention and the evolution of society to
ward higher and . more complex forms of hu
man relationship, become an insufferable
burden, and an undeniable oppression to the
wageworking classes; and whereas, the afore
said competitive system (otherwise known as
the capitalistic plan of private exploitation of
those deprived of tools and land) has, through
its phenomenal accumulation of wealth into
the hands of the few, become a stumbling
block in \ the Â path of progress, a prolific cor-'
r uptor of Â public ' freedom â ;: and - a .? menace
to individual liberty, : using its unjust ad
vantages over the masses of the people to coerce
and again cajole them into the support of po
litical measures which would be an Insult to
the conscience of freemen, and to I which- their
pressing physical needs alone give sanction;
and whereas, the mentallyjcapable among the
wageworkiug classes, knowing . the unjust
foundation of the competitive system and the
unequal advantages accruing to those who
control and profit by it, are by â¢ far too clever
not |to know that all that this iniquitous sys
tem can, of its own motion, possibly yield to
the waeeworker is merely that amount of his
product necessary to the renewal of his. labor
power, withholding from him, by the terms of
the system, his well-earned leisure, luxury and
recreation; therefore, be it -,-"â¢;-*
Resolved, That we, the accredited representa
tive!*, of the trades and labor organizations of
San Francisco, In convention assembled, after
due deliberation, do hereby proclaim it to be
our sincere conviction that the present anar
chial system of private; individual land and
tool owning," which places ; the many | at; the
mercy of the few, is tne fundamental cause of
the industrial distress and economic slavery of
the masses of the workers; and that in accord
ance with the foregoing conviction we pro
ceed to organize our federated fores on such
lines as are best calculated to supplant com
petition and its fraudulent ; fundamentals, by
substituting therefor a system of j universal co
! operation founded ; upon the socialization of
the means ef productionâ land, tools and cap
ital; and belt further _â ;< â â¢ â â :. >:â â :â  ., y ; y rv >. *â â¢â¢'
â¢ Resolved, That to this end we not only organ
ize industrially but \in addition thereto use
our political rights and privileges in a manner
consistent ; with our economic belief, -â  taking
such distinct political action as will forever
throw off the yoke of our capitalist masters.
1 : The Painters' Union presented a similar
declaration of principles. *'-â¢
j T. ". M. Butler presented the following
resolution : y, . . ,y - 'â¢ '_; - y. : \ .''..'â . '"* 'â '.":
That we recommend that the labor societies
of San Francisco, through the Labor Council,
issue an official newspaper, to be delivered
free to all members of all its constituent unions.
M. McGlynn offered the following:
Whereas, It is stated on good authority that
the presence in the City of William Pinkerton,
the Chicago detective, is due to an attempt on
his part to secure a footing for his armed force
in this State; and whereas, we have witnessed
how In every State in which this, pander
and his minions have been tolerated riot and
bloodshed inevitably followed in their wake;
therefore, be it ,
Resolved, That the trades unions of San Fran
cis-co, in meeting; assembled, do hereby pledge
themselves ato use ; every /-honorable means
within their power to have the following law
enacted at the next session of the California
Legislature:
.â .No armed police force" or representatives of
a detective agency shall ever be brought into
this State for the suppression of domestic vio
lence, nor shail any other armed or unarmed
body of men be brought In for that purpose ex
cept upon the application of the Legislature or
of the executive of ; this State when the Legis
lature Is not in session, as provided in the con
stitution of the United States.'* y
A delegate, who a3ked that his name be
not made public as he feared its publica
tion might cost him his job, asked to have
the following read:
Whereas, The eight-hour law enacted by the
National Government is being continually
violated by unscrupulous contractors, be it
Resolved. That this labor convention do most
earnestly protest against | the continued viola
tion of the eight-hour law, and that our Repre
sentatives in Congress be requested to aid us
in the enforcement of the law by calling the
attention of the proper officials to our de
mands.
From the Bakers' Union came the sub
joined:
Whereas, the wage-working bakers of this
City, besides being worked tor .. the greatest
number of hours for the least proportionate
pay, are obliged to pass their working-hours
surrounded by sanitary conditions unfit for
human beings; therefore be it
Resolved, That it is the sense of this conven
tion that sanitation of bakery-shops should be
made the subject of : rigid. examination by the
| health authorities, in the interest both of the
public health and that of the wageworking
bakers. y
It was decided to meet again on Sunday
at 10 a. m. at the place of last night's meet
j ing to continue the work of the convention.
Mr. West, one of the representatives of
the A. 11. U., stated that his organization
| had in future decided to go into politics
! and intended to keep a blacklist of those
I arrayed against labor in the same way in
which the Southern Pacific Company
keeps a blacklist of .the members of the
A. 11. U.
T. F. Burns also stated that the Cigar
makers' Union had decided to go into
politics in the sole interests of labor and
the working people. * Other speakers also
addressed the meeting along the same
lines, and it was nearly 12 p. m. before ad
journment was taken.
AN INSANE MAN'S MONEY
The Estate ot John McDonough,
Who Was Prominent in Min
ing Stock Times.
Appearance of Two Claimants Who
Live in County Tyrone, Ireland,
Who Want $10,000.
For many years prior to the early part
of 1887 those who had business with Dr.
Fox,' the well-known capitalist, stock
broker and mining man. were waited upon
by a stout, able-bodied clerk who was
within two inches of reaching the six-foot
mark. His name was John McDonough,'
and he was noted for the affable manner
in which he received * all who called at the
office. ~ fl : -.Ay'..'~y'il'~' : i"A v
He disappeared from the office, and there
were but few who were aware -.of the fact
that a malady had * affected his brain to
such a degree that he had to be committed
to the asylum for the insane at Napa.
He was sent there on the 21st of March
of the year named, and in the desolate
home from which he was taken â  there re-
I mained his wife and son Frank. These
! were without relatives in this City or State.
McDonough remained in the asylum until
the 18th of June of last year, when he
died.
During the time he was an inmate of
the home for the unfortunate he met losses
which lie never understood. His wife- and
his son died, but the announcement of their
deaths did not produce any effect upon
him, for his mind could not appreciate the
import of the news imparted 10 him.
When the news of his death became
known in this City A. C. Freese, the Pub
lic Administrator, applied for letters of
i administration, which were issued to him
I on July 2 following the death, it appear-
I ing at that time that McDonough had died
I intestate, and that it was necessary to look
i after his estate, consisting of $10,000 in
I bank. 'â .*
;â On the 4th inst. there was discovered
among effects that belonged to McDon- 1
ough a will which he had signed before he
lost his : mind, and that fact was made
known to Attorney M. C. Hassett of this
City, who, on examining the document,
discovered that it was of no more value,
from a legal standpoint, than if it had been
so much blank paper. Mrs. McDonough
and her son were made the. sole legatees,
but as both were dead and died before the
testator \ passed away, those who would
have been their heirs at law could not set
up a claim to the property. Mr. Hassett
has instituted a search in this City for rel
atives of McDonough, but has not been
able to discover any. Some time before
the finding of the will he was engaged to
appear for and represent in the Probate
Department of the Superior Court one
Michael McDonough, who lives at Lion
Mills, in County Tyrone. Ireland. ".-â " a
member of the Royal Irish Constabulary,
who claims to be a nephew of .the de
ceased. '".-'â  "â¢â . â 
Alexander Vogelsang, another attorney,
has entered an appearance for Susan Coy
of Toberlane, County Tyrone, who claims
to be a sisterof the deceased, but, singular
it is, that these two claimants are not re
lated. McDonough, in a; communication
recently received, asserts that the -â â¢ rival
claimant was never named McDonough,
but : that : she is ' the daughter âof . Peter
Donaghey. Some â¢" time since â : a commis
sion was issued to take depositions in this
matter, and this will arrive here in |aj few
days, when i the " testimony of t Susan ' Coy
will be produced, and this may shed some
light upon the alleged relationship. yy^ 7 ?,;
Michael Trainor of 1 this City, , who - was
well acquainted with McDonough before
he became insane, said; that he met Mc-
Donough in Sierra' County in 1856, where
he was engaged in mining and where he
remained | until the ' Reese y River excite
ment in 18G2,; when he went there, was a
miner and later ; was connected : with an
assay office until 1871, when * ; he" came to
this city aud entered the employment of
Dr. Fox. In :1882^McDonough, became
prominently connected with ; t he estate of
Michael Lynch, a well-known capitalist of
Virginia City, ; Nev., who, ' dying, : left an
estate valued at ; v $1,000,000. * McDonough
was appointed guardian- of 'Lynch's chil
dren and their estate by Judge Finn.
; Mrs.'McDonough x was : Roseina Scanlan
before marriage, sister of Willie Scanlan,"

GORI PREACHES
HIS DOCTRINES.
Many Italians Listen to
an ; Address by the
Anarchist.
TALKS OF HUMAN BEASTS
Distribution of Property He
Thinks Nothing but a Half
Measure.
SAYS WAGES ARE BUT SLAVERY
He Urges His Hearers to Help Toward
the Dawn of Anarchy's --
Reign.
There were about twice as many people
in Apollo Hall last night as there were
seats, for Pietro Gori was to expound the
ways of anarchism to his compatriots, and
before the time for beginning his address
several hundred ; people were waiting to
hear him. ..,...â .
The young anarchist spoke for over two
and a half hours without any ' apparent
fatigue. He showed himself to be a bril
liant orator, possessed of a perfect Niagara
of words, and he dashed into similes,
metaphors and Mights of rhetoric, which
were effective enough in an address, but
which could not be compressed into the
space of a newspaper report.
"We anarchists do not want to beproph-

ets,'.' he said. "Ours is a new world, but
it exists ; the only difficulty is to reach it.
"Like Christopher Columbus, we must
go forth and : conquer. We want â  to see
society reduced to â a < band ;of â¢ organized
laborers. Do not say that, this social
equality is a" dream ; it exists; as the world
of Christopher Columbus existed."
Having defined his hopes the anarchist
turned his attention to modern conditions.
"Present society is a system of complicated
crime," he remarked cheerfully. "Employ
ers give you the choice of work at starvation
rates, with the alternative of starving if
you refuse to accept them. In fact, you
can be fried or roasted, and you are free to
choose the sauce. The employer says:
'I won't force you to be roasted; you are
free to refuse the $1 50 or the $3 that I offer
you, and if you refuse . you have liberty
to starve.' This is the ferocious liberty of
the present state of society.
"They do not realize, these capitalists,
that man is not a machine. ; He does not
Ilive1 live for himself he must think of his wife,
his children.' Their mouths want bread
as well as his.
"I see here in America your fine build
ings, your stores filled with i costly stuffs ;
they are for rich ladies your wives must
go poorly clad. You are better paid than
our Italian peasants, < who are always
. haunted by the â¢ livid specter of Hunger,
but for America, also, I foresee the tragic
end. : ;â -.- :'â 
'â¢. "They tell you that you have worked too
much, produced too much. There is a
glut in the market and mills and factories
, must close down. Why, because we . have
over fatigued ourselves, must we now die
of hunger? " The society in which we live
is ; crazy : the more we produce the less
we have. ,^_fi3^ * ' ' " '
, ; "We anarchists do not study history as .
they study it in schools Garibaldi won
such a . battle,';' Victor Emmanuel v con
quered such a town.' We remember the
obscure heroes who faU on the : battlefield,
the rabble who are slain and whose,; bones
are piled up in a great ' heap and are for
gotten. ,We remember, : too, . the heroes
who A die of work , in , the -battle 'â¢' of . life.
What were the middle . classes a few cen
turies ago? " Nothing.. hat are they to
day? Everything. "'<-. What r are we, the
rabble, to-day? a^ Nothing. ? But to-morrow
we shall hold the powerâ the movement is
already in motion." 'A.
A. The speaker expressed his belief, that
machines â  are the â¢- great revolutionists,
which will be the â â  means ; of reorganizing
society. He ; described *: the competition
which men' have to maintain against these
automatic laborers. "The machines which'
could spare our labors are our curse," he
said.; . "It is * because i they are not in the i
hands \of ; the laborerâ in the handsâ yes,* |
but not in the power.':'; Aristotle said slav- I
cry would end when a race of steel laborers I
arose which were not of flesh; and blood.
This steel laborer has come, and the end df I
slavery has become a dream that can be
realized, â¢ Â« * ' * - '
AA "To-day they call it wages/* It is slavery ; â  i
worse than the slavery of antiquity, for it
was to the interest of the master to con
sider the well-being of his slaves. To-day
it is to' his interest to work them to death.
When they send' human hearts to tight in
Africa what does it matter how fast they
fall? A hundred horses die and the Gov
ernment regrets them, for horses repre
sent money. But a hundred men are
killed Oh, it costs nothing to replace
them. .This poor human race is so pro
lific there: is nothing in a hundred men
more or Jess." \
â¢ Coming to what he called the difficult
point of the questionâ the coming social
movementâ Pietro Gori 'said his bearers
must not expect an infallible remedy or an
instant chance. â  "
"Life is always "a march toward an
ideal," said he*, and he instanced Goethe's
story of Faust, who, cloyed with|pleasure,
I demanded "more! morel" " '
"We of the socialistic school say that the
well-being of the world will come through
the restitution "of stolen wealth to society
and the abolition of private property. We j
don't want distribution, but community of
property." ' V 'â '-'â '-. *..*V ; - .*
The lecture concluded with a glowing
picture of life under anarchistic condi
tions, when all men would participate in
the joys of existence, and when art and
pleasure would no longer be the monopoly
of the minority. "The moral atmosphere I
will be . quite different from the miasma
that you are breathing to-day, but in order
to achieve this result you must destroy
.the monopoly, or you yourselves will be
destroyed. I urge you to aid the cause of
anarchy." ________________ "y_.*v-y-
LOS ANGELES` BIG CRUSH.
It Causes an Enormous Increase
in the Business of the
Courts.
Police Judge Morrison's Phenomenal
Record as a Case-Trier
Court Building.
* Police Judge D. C. Morrison of Los An
geles is at the Grand. The Judge says
that there has been such an increase of
population at Los Angeles lately that an
other Police Judge is a necessity.
At present Judge Morrison and another
Judge do all the work. Police Judge J. C.
Ross of Pasadena is officiating in Judge
Morrison's place during his absence.
From: what is told he will have enough to
do to keep him busy.
The population of Los Angeles and the
immediate surroundings is now given at
about 100,000. On Sundays the Temescal
road and also the Southern Pacific's
branch, which runs from the city to the
beach at San Pedro, are thronged with
people. The scene is much like that pre
sented between here and the Cliff House.
"The increase of people at Los Angeles,"
said Judge Morrison, â¢ "has made it a
necessity that we have ' another Police
Judge. We will have to go before the next
Legislature and ask for relief. It will he
impossible to get along as we are. The
Judges cannot try the cases.
"During the past year I have tried over
2000 misdemeanor cases, about 150 cases of
felony and between 600 and : 700 civil suits.
This is an enormous amount of work for
one court. Police Judge Jones I suppose
has tried about as many cases. ;C'
"It will be impossible for two Judges to
do the work soon. As it is, we are doing
the best we can.
â â â â  "We are erecting a new police head
quarters building. The site will be very
convenient, and the building, wheu com
pleted, will be handsome. It will have
three large courtrooms for Police Judges."
The Judge is here for a stay of several
days. He is on a professional visit. Judge
Morrison is a native of Pittsburg, and went
to Los Angeles â  about eight years ago at
the time of the great rush there.

LIKE A MAN
Are the People In the State â  of Wash-
ington Remarkable? \-
There Is One Who Will Telf the
Truth Every Time.
JS THE WORLD FULL OF LIARS? TIIAT
-*- seems a curons query, but by "a liar" is not
meant here exclusively or even particularly a falsi-
fier. A lie has been very properly defined as an
attempt to deceive, and. those "who damn with
faint praise" when the whole truth would serve the
case are very evidentlyâ if this definition be cor-
rectâliars. , The term is a harsh one to use, doubt
less, but there are cases in. which' it "is justifiable
I Let us take a_ an instance that of a man who has
I been ill, and on meeting a friend he is asked what
accounts for his improved appearance. lie (rill
say, perhaps, that he -'never was very ill," but
that Dr. Ho-nnd-So hud "visited him once, or
twice." Now, if he Is recovering from a danger-
ous illness that man might in all justice be termed
a liar. But speaking of this class of prevari-
cators is reminiscent of the fact that they do not
seem to be plentiful in the State of Washington.
j Take the instance of George H. Rice, who some
j few months ago was on the verge of a most serious
j and vital nervous trouble. He lives at Fort
l Canby, Wash., and when he was fully aware as to
how sad a state he was in he applied to that grand
medical institute, the Hudson, and being told that,
bad as bis case was it was curable, he placed him-
self unreservedly in the hands of the specialists
there. Here is what he has to say when asked as
to the result of the treatment:
Fort Canby, Wash., Ang. 5, 1895.

Gentlemen : Your favor of July 30 is at hand, and
1 thought I had written you long ago, but as 1 have
not done so perhaps this will do.
The treatment from the Hudson Medical Insti-
tute is all that could be expected or desired by any
one, as your medicine has, I think, established a
perfect cure In my case, and I hope and think It

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Peter Maher has sand, but it is all in his

orders for The Sunday Call.
Plucking the pelican is a hard job even
for Uncle Samâ he is a tough bird.

Arizona has now a right to enter the
Unionâ she has stopped a prize-fight.
Fitzsimmons has another chance to get

Congress seems to be hopelessly stuck, \

Between the Senate and the House there !
seems to be a great pit, and many is the j
bill that falls therein.
Only a short time ago it was thought i
impossible to put another twist in the
lion's tail, but the Irish are doing it.
It is not necessary to turn tbe cathode !
ray on the Custom-house, for the skeleton j
in that establishment is already visible.
Now that it is reported that Nansen has
discovered the north pole, it is about time !
to fit out an expedition to discover him.
As Pan Stuart has failed in his fistic
carnival, he might go to Kentucky and
see if he cannot pull off the Senatorial
fight. .
Some politicians are so much afraid of
monkeying with a buzz-saw they won't
even serve the wood when the saw is run
ning. ____________
Huntington will, no doubt, be perfectly â¢
willing to give testimony under oath, as
he was never more inclined to swear than
rieht now.
In the absence of more reliable reports
concerning the discovery of the north pole,
we may as well continue to talk about
politics and the cathode ray. ,
Although the third-term idea is no
longer putting up anything like a fight, it
is still in the Democratic ring and no one
has had the nerve to haul it out.
If Nansen, or any other explorer, finds
the north pole by drifting along the Jean
nette current, then the Jeannette must
have been there first and the pole is ours.
According to Judge Campbell the ordi

as they cannot throw in an electoral vote
with him the offer will probably be de
clined with thanks.
Under her new electric movement, Sac

velop a civic life in which the Capitol will
be only a sideshow.
Although the anti-funaing resolution of
the last Legislature does not appear in the
published records, it was not wholly lost.
It was sent to Washington all right and is
on the records there.
The attention of the British Parliament
has been suddenly distracted from the
contemplation of foreign affairs by tbe dis
covery that home rule has the floor and
demands a hearing.
Many Democrats have been mentioned
for the Presidential nomination, nut in no
case has the mention been more than a
faint suggestion or the response to it any
thing louder than a muffled sound.
Republicans fitly celebrated the anni
versary of the birthday of Lincoln and the
Democrats gave due observance to Jack
son's day, so now let. Us' all join in and
make a grand celebration of the birthday
of George Washington.
If Fitzsimmons and Peter Maher would
quit calling themselves champions they
could go to Boston and have a boxing
match to a finish at any time, but then
they would not get so much advertising, r
and that gives them pause.
The Senate silver bill has been defeated
in the House, and it is fairly certain the
House . tariff bill win be defeated in the
Senate, so there is apparently no way to
bead off Mr. Cleveland's deficit and bond
issuing game at this session.
The vigor with which the bull-fighting
Mexicans protest against the desecration
of their soil by a prize-fight is but another
evidence of the tendency of men to atone

those they have no mind to.
Cecil Rhodes, we are assured by Mr.'
Chamberlain, has given his promise, to
confine his energies hereafter to the devel

made no promise as to what limits he

The. promised cross - examination of
Huntington by Senator Morgan ought to
make as good sport as any, we have had in
a long time, for the California man is a
tough customer and the Alabama fellow is
said to have a brain full of buzzsaws.
The deadlock between the Senate and

A BIASED ARGUMENT.
In the San Francisco Post Colonel John
P. Irish makes an elaborate argument
against the foreclosure of the Government
mortgage on the aided roads. The burden
of it is that if the mortgage should be fore
closed, and if * the Gould and Vanderbilt
'interests should [secure the road at the
sale, and that if the amount which they
pay shall be $84,000,000 less than the total
debt on the . two roads, the Government
will be' making them a present of
$34,000,000, and they will move the
distributing center of the roads from San
Francisco to the Atlantic coast. Hence
the Central Pacific can no longer charge
the business men of Ogden for freight
shipped from Boston a rate equal to the
charge from Boston to "; San Francisco and
from San Francisco to Ogden, and hence
San Francisco would lose the benefit of
the extra charge.
Those are not the words in which
Colonel Irish states his argument, < but
they are the ones in which it Jis fairly ex
pressible. But the colonel does gravely
assume that the roads will be sold at 40
per cent of their debt to the Government,
or very nearly that amount; that the
Gould and Vanderbilt interests will buy
them ; that these interests will transfer
the distributing point from the Pacific to
the Atlantic, and that the Southern Pa
cific will no longer have a distributing
system in California.
Not a single one of these premises is
a certainty, and some are clearly in
correct. Even if they all * should prove
true (which would be next to a miracle),
in exchange for the supposed evils which
their occurrence would produce we should
witness an absolute destruction of the
Southern Pacific Company's monopoly, a
breaking of the power which the Pacific
Mail and the Southern Pacific have created
by reason of the Pacific Mail's compact
with the Panama Railway, an equitable
rate for points between San Francisco and
the Missouri River (and this would tend
to populate that region and increase the
market for California products), a policy
of low rates between the supposed Atlan
tic distributing center and California in
order to advance the interests of that im
aginary center, and in the natural course
of events a competing line of steamers be
tween California and the Orient as an
adjunct to the new trunk line.
This is merely applying Colonel Irish's
own argument to the case. It is evident
that if the Vanderbilt and Gould interests
have. the smallest chance of receiving a
present of $34,000,000 from the Govern
ment and of enjoying the trunk-line bene
fits indicated by Colonel Irish, they will
have active competition in the bidding;
that this bidding will destroy the prospect
of such a gift, and that therefore the argu
ment reduces itself to an absurdity. The
Gould and Vanderbilt interests are not the
only ones in the country.
San Francisco does not receive the
benefit arising from adding the local rate
to the overland rate in distributing arti
cles of Eastern manufacture to the country
tributary to it. That benefit goes to the
Southern Pacific Company alone. The
policy manifestly retards the development
of the tributary country, and that injures
San Francisco. This City can be nothing
but a reflex of the conditions which sup
port it. The future greatness of Sau Fran
cisco depends on the development of its
tributary country, and the one thing that
prohibits that development to-day is the
high charges of the Southern Pacific in the
exercise of its power as a monopoly. The
passing of the Union and Central Pacific
roads into competing hands would destroy
that power and encourage interior develop
ment. That would mean the progress of
San Francisco. _j '. *, "
' It was unfortunate. for Colonel Irish's
argument that it should include the asser
tion that the funding bill would secure
the Government the whole debt, dollar
for dollar. That is so clearly a plea for
perpetuation of a monopoly which fore
closure would crush that it need not be
seriously considered.
CLEARING THE BOULEVARDS.
The order passed by the Board of Super
visors declaring Golden Gate avenue a
boulevard and clearing it of all freight
hauling vehicles except those 'serving the
residents along the thoroughfare only
emphasizes the value, of the street for
freighting and the hardships which will
be imposed by the closing of that street to
such traffic and its being turned upon
streets having bad pavements.. The next
boulevard to be declared will be Van Ness
avenue, and the order will be made to
cover Lombard street as soon as that thor
oughfare has been put in order by the
narrowing of the sidewalks. As every
other street properly paved, well suited to
pleasure travel and declared a boulevard
will be likewise . closed against freight
traffic the drays will be driven into lines
growing more and more restricted and
kept always upon the poorest pavements.
: It is a curious inconsistency which gives
greater attention to pleasure travel than to
freight, but as the precedent is so well
established it would *be useless to argue
against it. One argument in :" its favor is
that there would be no pleasure travel if
the streets were bad, whereas freight traffic
is a necessity and will be conducted under
any circumstances. At the same time it
would be folly to overlook the fact that
\ the solid welfare of a city is dependent far
more on. good freighting highways than
on smooth pavements for any other use. -
The terrible â  streets . over which freight
has to bo carried in drays from Fourth and
Townsend streets to the business parts of
town represent a heavy charee upon the
consumers of the City.* The : draymen
must charge a price sufficient to cover the
enormous wear and tear on their ' horses
and wagons and to compensate them for â 
the great loss of time required in making
tedious headway. The merchants in turn
are compelled to add this charge to the
selling price of ' ; their wares, and thus the
cost of living is increased.
The men who do the hard work of dray
ing in -this City will likely not take a
cheerful view of ; their â¢ being ;. ordered 'off
streets â¢ they need more than ; any other
citizen. The draying^ interest- here is
very large, and if properly organized for
securing good - pavements would ~j , be a
power. Hackmen, liverymen and bicyclers
have been benefited by . the order clearing
Golden Gate; boulevard, draymen A alone
being â¢ injuriously - affected. ';-,- Yet I all these
four . interests ; should .combine -: and - work
unceasingly for good streets. If they did
the draymen would : soon be without cause
for complaint.
AIDING POOR STUDENTS.
" The student who has no means and who
is so ''desirous;, of an education: as to â¢be
anxious to i work for a living while he is
securing it has the stuff 'â¢ in him oat of
which the very ; best citizens '.? are made.
The ; picture j presented fby .; such a case is
exceedingly i pathetic, '< but ; it is noble and
inspiring as well. These facts are called
to mind by, the report which has* just been
made by the Students'; Aid . Society,' main
tained by appreciative citizens for the pur
pose /of securing employment ~, for I- those
who wish to _ attend ; the State University
and â . who have not â¢ the V means otherwise to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1896.
support themselves during the time. ; This
society, though new, last year found em
ployment for thirty-four ambitious young
men and women, and thus enabled them
to go to school, but there were eighteen
more who had to be turned away by reason
of the society's inability to find positions
for them. '\\ 'â  â¢ "â * ."â¢
"The work most sought for," the society
reports, "is naturally coaching, tutoring,
translating, clerical work and reading to
the blind, but many students are glad to
do ' housework, milking; ' gardening % and
chores of all kinds in return for board and
lodging. ; ' Others would ; take : charge of
vacant houses during vacations or at other
times, and not merely in Berkeley but in
any of the neighboring cities and towns."
It seems incredible that the value of such
a disposition is not appreciated by a larger
number of citizens than "those contained
in the aid society. It is a reproach to all'
the communities contiguous to Berkeley
that a single young man or woman who is
so anxious for an education as to be will
ing to work in order to secure it should be
denied that poor privilege.
There is a large number of young Japan
ese in San Francisco who are getting an
education in â¢ our public schools in that
wayâ probably hundreds of them. Likely
no Japanese who wants the benefit fails in
his efforts to secure the desired position.
Many of them are said to belong to proud
families at home, whose members would
look upon menial service in Japan as de
grading,. but the arrangement is regarded
as being particularly advantageous, as it
gives these foreigners a better opportunity
to learn our language and broaden their
views.
The white boys or girls who are willing
thus to sacrifice their pride should be re
garded as belonging to a superior race of
mortals, as most certainly they do. If the
aid society cannot find employment for
all who apply it should be provided with
funds from the private fortunes of those
who are able to contribute. It is a shame
that any American boy or girl who wants
to accomplish something in life should be
denied an education by the grinding mas
tery of poverty. ', -A. â  _' â  .
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
The Sunday Call differs from the week
day issues not only in the fact that it is
double the ordinary size, but also because
it contains a wide range of special articles
and illustrations resting on a plane wholly
apart from the tedium of an every-day
chronicle. The finding of matter which is
both elevating and interesting is not an
easy task, and hence the pains exercised in
the compilation of The Sunday Call are
great. That the desired end is achieved is
proved by the large extra demand for the
Sunday issue, and the fact that large num
bers of that edition are sent East every
week by Californians.
A symposium will appear in to-morrow's
issue on that very ( vexing clause of the cus
tomary marriage service requiring the wife
, to promise obedience to her husband. The
contributors to it are ten or a dozen repre
sentative ministers of San Francisco,* who
will probably state the position of their
respective churches on the subject.
A highly dramatic and instructive ar
ticle will tell the true story of how an en
terprising Yankee boy became a financial
lord in Siberia. As he is known to a num
ber of San Franciscans and maintains a
palace in Moscow the account will have a
living interest. .
Another chapter from real life gives the
exploits of a boy who traveled extensively
as a deaf mute, to his own profit and the
discomfiture of many with whom he came

THE DECLINE OF ENGLAND'S QUEEN
It is Impossible longer to conceal the fixed
anxiety which oppresses the court circles' of
Great Britain concerning the condition of the
Queen. . From time to time, for several years,*
the public mind, agitated by disquieting
rumors, has been calmed by reassuring.state-,
ments from the royal physicians;. but there is
little doubt that the latter are themselves the
victims of considerable disquietude to-day. 'â¢

naming of Mare Island :.-â â **
- 1 : send : you the origin of the; naming of Mare
Island ws given - by Dr. Vallejo, a relative of the
late general, I suppose, in the - Historical I Atlas of
Solano County, published in 1878. Jln early days
tne only ferry-boat on the waters near Vallejo and
Benicia was a rude one made chiefly of oil barrels
obtained- 1 from whaling ships, , and propelled, by
sails. Those ; barrels "> were ; secured ' together _by
beams and planking, and it was divided into com-.
partments * for I the .. accommodation of cattle, to
which it was chiefly devoted.' One day while this
boat was coming trom Martinez to Benicia a sud
den squall overtook it and the craft pitched fear
fully. | The animals, chiefly horses, became restive
and soijie of them broke through it. The boat was
upset and the living i cargo | thrown | Into the | bay.
Home of ;* the - livestock were drowned; and some
managed to reach either shore by swimming. *- One
of the animals, an old white mare, much prized by
General Vallejo, succeeded | In effecting ; a landing
on the island, and was i rescued | there | a few I days
after *â¢ oy the general, who ; thereupon called the
place *'Isla de la Yegua'' (Mure Island). :

A BOX-PLEATED SKIRT.
The new skirts are cut with two gores in the
back, which form box-pleats. The one shown
here has in all seven gores, the two side gores
flowing wide at the foot, and close fitted over
the hips. The great advantage gained by two
side gores is the permanent good shape, for
these gores do not stretch out of shape as a
wider and necessarily more bias gore would.
All fabrics are cut in this way, and the . side
gores are usually cut straight at . the front
edge, but if striped goods is use;!, they may be
cut straight through the center, thus lining
the edges both bias, and making the stripes
meet at the seams. The back gores are cut
with the straight thread through the center in
any case. * ; .
Black satin is still as much used as any other
fabric for skirts to be worn with fancy blouse
waists or coat basques for full-dress occasions.
The latest thing is the lining of white silk,
finished with a plain binding of velveteen or
braid, the balayuese ruffle being' quite out of
date. -s The only stiffening now used is a band
of haircloth about six inches wide, at the foot,
and even; this is omitted in many skirts, the
place depending on the proper cut, and on the
body of the silk used for lining.
Dresden silks are > much used for separate
skirts, and rl recommend . themselves : because
two or , three different ;- colors will generally
harmonize with them, and ' so a great variety
in waist is possible. Â« One of .'brown with black
satin threads, the flowers being indefinite
tones of violet, had a brown velvet coat basque
a - black satin â¢ waist ana a waist of violet
chiffon trimmed with sable for evening wear.
Crepons in black or : colors , are made up for
dressy wear with extra waist, and also waists
to match.* The round waist with basque por
tion added is more used for coat waists of such
fabrics than the models; in which the basque
portion is cut in one with the top. ' .
â a Dresses ! of i wools, such as cheviot, tweed
serges /taA cloth have skirts cut after this
model, with neat fitted waists untrimmed for
general wear, or trimmed with velvet, Dresden
silk, ribbons, lace or spangled bands for after
noon or evening wear. â  --f

ished last Thursday night. Had it been I
impossible to do the work. the 'docking .of I
the Pacific Mail Company's City of Peking, !
cquld not have been accomplished and the j
repairs necessary on her would have to be i
done in Hongkong. The overhauling of !
the big steamer will probably cost $5000,
and that sum would have been â¢ lost to San ,
Francisco had the entrance to the dock
not been cleared.
When the matter first came up Captain
James H. Bruce, superintendent of the
California Drydock Company, applied to
the Harbor* Commissioners for assistance.
He explained that all the available
dredges were on the Sacramento. River,
and that if - one .of the State's could be
spared it would be an : aid to commerce, j
The board finally came to the conclusion !
that the work would be an infringement of j
the law, which .prohibits the State from
entering into competition with private in
dividuals, and which also says that no |
work shall be done by State -dredges or i
tow boats outside the jurisdiction of the
board,; - :
Captain Bruce bowed to the Jaw, but he |
was determined that the way , should be i
made clear for the docking of the City of
Peking. He hired the tug Sea King and
determined to get rid of , the silted mud by !
means of her wheel. At low water last
Thursday the gate was removed from the l
drydock r and the tug was driven into the j
entrance. ' She was made fast; and then |
the engines were started. As the wheel i
revolved it stirred up the mud and soon!
made a clear passage the length of the. big
tug. She was then backed and the opera- i
tion repeated until a regular passage was j
cut from the dock to the end of the wharf.
The sides were then , treated in a similar
manner, and when the tide began to make
there was a free channel. for. the City of
Peking as soon as she arrives in San Fran
cisco. ':. â : '. : '.Â»'.':â ' ' .".' â¢â¢ '\. 'â '-
Captain Bruce, who engineered the job,
is one of the oldest and most- experienced
masters on the Pacific Coast. .Besides
being superintendent of the California
Drydock Company, he is marine surveyor
for the Fireman's Fund ; Insurance Com
pany, superintendent of; the Crescent City
Transportation i Company and : managing
owner of nearly a dozen coasters.- He was
naturally a little sore over the refusal of
the Harbor Commissioners to send ; a
dredger, but he *is _ now â¢ correspondingly
jubilant over A the success of his experi
ment. The tug did the work in four
hours that would have taken the. dredger

struck Robinson on ; the ' jaw and knocked
him into the gutter. A rough and tumble
fight ensued in which: pistols were drawn,
and had it not been for the interference of
Captain " Humphreys ;of _ the ",? Jeanie and
half a dozen others there might have been ;
a death. There was blood shed in plenty,
as McGregor's first blow broke the skin of
Robinson's face and the second, which
was - square on the nose, started a flood
which was not stopped for twenty minutes.
Captain ' Robinson has "-been. a kind of '

taken him on several cruises; and helped
him out in a great many instances. Lat
terly Robinson i married Mrs. Ida Green,

who was drowned in the steamer Elbe, and
since that time he has lived in Alameda.
He was a neighbor of his old-time friend,

WARNING OF SMALLPOX
Suspects Said to Be on Their
Way Here From Ellis [.
Island.
BOARD OF HEALTH IS ALERT.
Six New Milk Inspectors Will Be
Appointed at Salaries of
$75 Each.
â  The startling information was conveyed
to the Board of Health at its special meet
ing yesterday that San Francisco is in dan-'
ger .of, a visitation :of smallpox from
abroad. The communication â [ was J from
the . Immigration Commissioner, at : Ellis
Island, N. V., where emigrants from Euro
pean countries are examined - before being
permitted to land in this country. '..
It is stated that a steamer which recently
arrived from Naples, * Italy,- had â - been in
fected with the dread disease, and that two
Italians had succeeded in eluding the vigi
lance of the authorities ; and ; had gone oh
board the cars bound for San Francisco.
The local authorities were warned to look
out for the two men, as they might spread
contagion. â¢ ;
The meager details given left the board
in a quandary as to the course to be pur
sued to apprehend the suspects, but it was
decided to send for more particulars post
haste and iin the mean time ' notify the
State Board of Health of the matter and
take all possible precautions until more
advices are obtained. It is j not believed
that any.serious oanger exists, as the dis
ease, if it attacks' the men, would prob
ably do so en route, but . the board will
take no chances of permitting the scourge
to obtain a foothold in this City.
The Milk Committee, consisting of Drs.
Hart and Morse, rendered a report on the
new ordinance which was full of interest
ing suggestions.
- After debating at length on the import
ance of pure milk as an article of diet, and
stating that the great mortality, among
young children is j largely attributable to
unwholesome milk, the report goes on to
say: â¢ < - â¢
The experiences of the last few months in
milk inspection have brought home to every
citizen a. thorough realization of the general
and almost universal adulteration of the milk
supply of this City, and while the City has
been most fortunate in having recently the
services of an efficient, - brave and untiring
milk inspector, tne tact â¢ that : milk comes into
this _ City from many quarters, and . during
every hour of the day and night, and is being
distributed over an area of over 20,000 acres,
by over 500 wagons, proves conclusively that
no one man can be expected to safeguard the
consumers of milk against adulterations,
which result , so largely to the pecuniary ad
vantage of unscrupulous dealers in milk.
Such an inspection at best can. never be any
thing but a temporary and utterly inadequate
alfair and almost valueless.' . Moreover, when
we consider the temptations to dishonesty in
the milk business, the ease with;which'adul
terations of milk can be made, the number of
persons engaged in the business of producing
and selling and using milk, and the difficulties
of such inspection over so large, an area and
the utter impracticability of having sufficient
inspectors to insure' purity of- milk, it will be
seen that some system or simple method for
accomplishing - thjs desired result must be
adopted. ..-â¢-, â¢â  . *'.'-.-"
The committee contended that the new
milk order will greatly improve the . state
of affairs. In relation .to inspection sta
tions the committee reported as follows:
The order further provides for public food
inspection stations, at which . milk must be,
and meat and fish, poultry, vegetables, and in 1
fact all other toads will be publicly inspected.
* * Pursuant to this order, we have | established
four public food inspection stations, situated
as follow:-: . â â¢â  !. â â 'â 'â '.-:.:'.â â â . '.-â  â *â ,-, -.- â¢:â -,-â ,:.
Food Inspection Station 1 is situated on . the
seawall at the Clay-street wharf. This . station
â¢has been granted- to the City ' gratuitously
through the courtesy ;of the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners, and is due largely. to
the good offices in that behalf of E. L, Colnon,
president of the board.;; . ;- - _ -
Food Inspection . Station 2 is situated * on
Fourth street, near King, and is as near to the
Fourth I and Townsend streets depot "of - the
Southern Pacific Railroad as could be obtained.
Food Inspection Station 3 : is situated on
Army street, near the corner of Alabama, this
being a central: point of ingress. to the City
from the San Bruno road and the County road,
which are the only two highways of entry by
land into the City from San Mateo County. â _â â¢â '
Food Inspection Station 4. is situated on
Geary street, near Central avenue,' being a
point of entry lor all dairies in the Richmond
District and along Point Lobos road. :..'
. These stations will all be open night and day
and thoroughly illuminated, and the total ex
pense to the City for rent and incidental ex
penses of all four stations will not exceed $10
per month. ' , '**:.'. -
We have thoughtfully and carefully consid
ered the necessities of the situation, 'the im
portance of having pure milk and other I foods
for over 300,000 inhabitants of ; this City, the
methods by which it can be accomplished and
the necessary expense which will be entailed
on the City for the realization of this vital ob
ject. We believe that the citizens of this City
will be glad to incur the small additional ex
pese necessary to secure so vital and so impor
tant a result as pure food for over a quarter of
million people; but however it may be regarded
by others we feel constrained in the fulfillment
of our official duties, with the view of attaining
that object, to recommend to this board the ap
pointment of six additional inspectors for the
four food-Inspection stations at a salary of $75
per month each. This will * necessitate an an
nual cost *of $5400. which will = insure < a
thorough inspection of all foods which come
into this City. : y â¢.* >v.---
When we consider that the annual expense'
of the City government in 1805 was $5,568,
--827 21, and that* the enormous advantage to
the public health of such dally inspection of
foods can be almost insured for the absolutely
insignificant sum of $5400, we cannot believe
that the foregoing recommendations will meet
the opposition of any person who really means
well by the people. Respectfully submitted, ;
â¢ ' J. F. Morse, ;
/ H. H. Hart.
.v The report : was . adopted . unanimously/
and the . board decided to ; defer < the .: ap
pointing of ;': the .* inspectors until legal ad
vice on the matter is obtained, the Board
of Supervisors having annonnced that the
salaries of the officials will not be paid.

The fact developed at yesterday's meet
ing of the Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors that a number of the funds
under the control of , the board â  nave been
overdrawn and that contractors who have
furnished the City with, goods and mate-;
rials may i have to : wait j for their money
until matters adjust themselves.
A. Greenbaum, representing the Pacific
Marine Supply Company, appeared before
the board to ask that his firm be given re
lief regarding an account against the City
for furnishing food - for ; - prisoners. He
stated that Auditor Broderick had refused
to sign his warrants on the ; ground that
the fund against which it was drawn was
in such a condition that to pay out the
amount dne would .violate the law known
as the .one-twelfth act. He asked that the
matter be adjusted, as the firm would be
compelled to stop supplies if it could not
get its money. '
Auditor Broderick stated that he must
keep within the law, but that if the board
would bunch; the prison funds, some of
which have a surplus, the money could be
paid and the funds allowed to adjust them
selves as the money for ? the next month
became available.
. Incidentally he stated that the water
fund was overdrawn about $2000 and other
funds .; to a greater or less ; extent. The
clerk was instructed to draw s up a resolu
tion permitting the Auditor to sign war
rants on any funds for the use of the pris
ons in order to relieve the pressure on the

take the Solano-street cars, thence transfer
to Bryant and from Bryant transfer to the
bobtaileu cars on Sixth street. * This takes
them ; to ( Sixth . and Market streets. The
trip occupies too much time to be practi
cal, and as a result the residents are com
pelled to pay two fares to get to Market
street.
(' N. Thompson, who was â¢ present as a
representative of the Potrero . Improve
ment Club, said they, were equally inter
ested with the Southern Club in .having
some improvement in the transfer system.
He expressed J indignation at the way they
had been treated, and he said the Potrero
residents wished to co-operate in demand
ing concessions. (. Numerous others spoke
in the ' same strain and Messrs. Pengelly,
Strand, â â¢ Felt, Raymond , and â¢ Davidson
were appointed to wait .upon tbe officials
of the; -Market-street Railway Company
and request that transfers be issued at the
juncture of Solano and Kentucky streets.'

RELIGION AND THE STATE
A Strong Though Invisible Link.
Said to Exist Between
Them.
Interesting and . Profound Discourse
Read by the Rev. Dr. Voor-
Sanger.
"Church and religion," said the Rev.
Dr. Voorsanger during last night's lecture
at the Temple Emanu-El, "do not mean
the same thing. A church is a system of
beliefs and observances governed by vary
ing laws, but religion is invariable and
universal. Religion pure and simple is
the practical application of the moral law
to human life and conduct. The constitu
tion of these United States recognizes no
church, but it ddes recognize religion. . It'
regards the churches as mere agents and
instruments of religion, and lets them
stand or fall on their own merits.
"At the same time," continued the elo
quent rabbi, "there is a strong though in
visible linK between religion and the civil
power. Religion is held in regard and
veneration by the Government as being a
powerful agency fpr the elevation of man- â¢
kind, for the formation of ; good citizens
and for the betterment of . the Republic.
Hence, while the Government disregards
sects and creeds it certainly renders every
due honor to religion. 'In the appoint
ment of days of thanksgiving or of fasting
the state attests the dependence of the
human race upon its Creator. By appoint
ing chaplains for legislative bodies and
for the army and navy the Government
evinces a desire not to smother the reli
gious instinct in the citizen's heart, but
rather to foster and develop â¢ it. In legis
lative assemblies, at least in a good many
of them, this public and formal homage to
the Deity is regarded as of so much im
portance that in the absence of a chaplain
some member of .the body reads a prayer
or a selection from the Scriptures.
"Another way in which the state honors
religion is by exempting the house of God
from taxation. This, unhappily, is not
the case in California; but it is right that
institutions which are non-productive in a
financial sense and which exist only for the
purpose" of aiding the civil power in the
preservation of Order and the betterment
of citizens should be excused from paying
tribute to the state.
--' "In the oaths which witnesses- are
obliged by law to take in certain judicial i
proceedings we find the State recognizing
religion and religion's author. The man !
taking an oath is ; required to say 'So help
me God.' This brief formula indicates
that the civil power recognizes the exist
ence of God, the fact of man's responsi
bility to God and the efficacy of the moral
law as an aid to the Government. " _ *
â¢â  â . "The state takes the citizen,' so to speak,
into the presence of his Maker in order that
his religious instinct, thus appealed to, may
I impel him to speak the truth. Again, re
ligion aids the state *in the very prisons,
where chaplains are appointed and main
tained in order that they may do their best
to bring out what good there may be in the i
souls of those undergoing punishment for j
crime. " -'.;â¢ -...â â¢.-.â  -â¢
"The law . revealed on Mount Sinai,"
said the reverend A speaker in conclusion,
"was not given to the Hebrews only. It'
was the voice of God speaking to the
world. This is the religion which under
lies the constitution of these United States.'
This is the religion which must, ever assist
the secular power in the grand work of I
bettering and ennobling mankind."

"THE CHURCH AND
THE SCRIPTURES"
Archbishop Riordan Ex
plains How They
Harmonize.
HIS GREAT LECTURE.
The Prelate Declares the Church
Lives Independent of the
Bible.
TRANSLATIONS OF SCRIPTURES.
The Bible in Religious Society Com- J
pared to the Constitution in Civil
Government.
The Most Rev. Archbishop Riordan de
livered a lecture on "The Church and the
Scriptures" before 'a large and cultured
audience at Metropolitan Hall last night. ;
His Grace held the undivided attention of
(be immense gathering for nearly two
hours. The discourse covered a wide field !
of history, showing extensive research and
profound learning.
Many prominent clergymen occupied |
seats on the platform, which was decorated
with palms and overhung with the National ,
colors. This was the last- lecture of the '
series under the auspices of the San Fran- '
cisco Educational Union.
When the eminent prelate walked out on j
the platform the people rose to their feet
oat of respect for him. The Archbishop ]
wasted no time in preliminaries, and was
soon lost in his subject. He spoke as fol
lows:
Mr. Chairman, Ladles and Gentlemen: The
object of this lecture is to indicate, as briefly
as the importance of the subject will permit
me. the part the Holy Scriptures hold in the .
Catholic system of theology, the grounds on
which the discipline of the church, respecting '
the reading of them in the vernacular tongue,
restsâ arid point out the solicitude of the Cath
olic church in preserving in all its purity and
integrity the written word of God. The theme
is too ample to be compressed within the limits
of a single lecture, and 1 can only call your at- I
tention to the prominent parts of thesubject.
We will first examine how Christ our Lord
intended his teachings to be transmitted to the .
world, what system did he devise that men
living in ages far removed from the one in
which he lived might be enabled to arrive
with a positive certainty at a knowledge of the
truths whose acceptance he made obligatory
on all.
OCX LORD CAME AS GOD AND MAN
To redeem fallen man. But his sole mission !
was not to satisfy the justice of God for sins
committed, but also to* form a vast community
of a spiritual nature, a community which
would not be conterminous with any country
or nation; dependent on himself alone for its
power and authority; whose dominion would j
commence In time and continue throughout I
eternity. He wished to breakdown the odious j
distinctions which existed in ages preceding i *
his coming, between man and man, between ; â 
nation and nation, that there might be "one j
fold and one shepherd." He came to dispel
the darkness which clouded the Intellect of '
man, to Infuse into his mind a correct idea';' of !
the relations which existed between him and
his creator. To that end he bequeathed to
mankind a religion, which all men were
obliged to receive, making their intellects, as
SL Paul says, "captive to the faith," if they
wished to have "any share in the inheritance of â 
God's chosen ones, for "he that believeth not
shall be condemned." i It is, therefore, evident
that the faith or "body of doctrine" given by i
our Lord to. the world was to be preserved- in
tact until the end of time.
ALL CHRISTIANS ADMIT IHIS. . AA/i._;
No matter what political revolutions might
sweep over the earth, no matter what new
theories might be broached in. civil govern- â 
ments, no matter what developments the arts :
or sciences might assume, the fundamental I
principles on which Christ built his church, I
the eternal truths which were to be its life, I
were always, and under every changed condi
tion of things, to remain the same. They were
to be like himself, who, in the words of St i
Paul, is "yesterday, to-day and the same for- i
ever." They might be better known, more
fully drawn-out into the conclusions which i
they contain, but they were to be in all times
substantially the same. And on this point all 1
Christians agree. For what is a Christian but j
a follower of Christ? : And who can be called a i
follower of Christ but he who receives with j
unquestioning faith and with childlike sim- |
plicity the teachings of Christ? All Christians !
anneal continually to the words of our Savior j
in their behalf; and the reason alleged by ,
those who are not of the fold of tho i
Catholic church for not receiving many !
of its doctrines is precisely that the
Catholic church no longer teaches what Christ
revealed; that in ages "long passed,' when
science was only in its cradle and the human
mind was in the infancy -of its developmentâ ]
In aires known to many under the name of the
"dark ages." because many are in the dark re- '
specting themâ the Catholic church proposed I
new doctrines, a new system of rellzlous belief, I .
the more effectually to retain In her grasp the ]
intellectual supremacy of the world; to be not
only mistress of the political world, but also of
the consciences of the human race.
It does not concern us at present what ex
planation may bo, given for their refusal to
submit to Catholic doctrine it is sufficient for !
our present, purpose that they admit with us I
that the doctrine revealed by Christ was to be
received, and believed not only by those who
were contemporaries with the apostles, the I
first teachers of Christian truth, but of all men j
in every age of the world. But to have pro- i
posed tnis doctrine and commanded submis- I
sion of man's intellect to its teaching was not '
sufficient to insure its perpetuity. It would j
not be the part of a wise legislator to have !
provided a constitution on which a society was '
to be founded, unless at the same time he had
provided most efficacious means by which all
men might come to a knowledge of its princi- i
ples, and ny which it might be transmitted I
unimpaired to the remotest generation.
XT CHRIST OCR LORD HAD NOT PROVIDED
Some such means, how are â¢ weâ living in the
nineteenth centuryâ to he absolutely certain of
tvhat he taught in the first?
We might, indeed, glean from the writings of
contemporary historians a few scanty outlines
of bis doctrine; a few traits of his character: a
few items of his private and public life. * They
might tell us, for instance,' that in the reign of I
the first Augustus, an extraordinary man ap- j
peared in the East, who preached doctrines j
whose beauty and sublimity told of a heavenly
origin; how great multitudes followed him as I
he evangelized Judea and Samaria: who
walked on the storm-tossed sea as if it were
dry land; who made the blind see, the deaf j
hear, the dumb speak; at whose potent word
the grave gave up its dead. They would tell
us of his death, resurrection and how at the I
close of his earthly life he triumphantly as
cended into heaven.
But all these details would hot suffice for tne
establishment and peroetulty of the Christian
religion. . .â<-,
We would not find in the. scattered frag
ments of historical documents that convinc- .
ing authority of Christ's -word or the obliga
tion of. receiving with unhesitating faith his
doctrines.
; Some means, therefore, were . to be provided
by Christ whereby men in every age could as
certain with an â  infallible certainty the doc
trines which our Lord intended should be em- '
bodied in the system of religion â . which he
gave the world. "â *; *-yy
On this point all Christians agree..' But what
means were provided? Here two different sys
tems claim our attention. The Protestant tells
us that we are to find the doctrines of Christ
by reading the Scriptures. Â»
According to his i belief, it is God's unerr
ing word and . contains all .'. the truths which
Christ taught. .' Consequently we are to consult
the Bible. -. It is to.be to. us. the only rule of
faith. In it and in it alone can. we* learn the
conditions of eternal life; and we are permit
ted to interpret it without the aid of an exter
nal authority, either by the ; supernatural aid
of the Holy Ghost or by the, natural light of
our own finite and erring reason. -
This is the. principle which, in theory at
least, is admitted to be the vital principle of
the Protestant system. And if in practice
Protestants court the alliance of an 'external
authority it Is done in direct contradiction to
their own system, using lor their own purposes
a power which tney declare despotic in
others. _______XÂ§B_ltÃÃÃMQfiiÂ£-' "
THE EARLY REFORMERS IN. THE FIRST PHASE OF
THE REFORMATION,, â¢ ,
Though they ; rejected the external authority
of the church as the interpreter of | Scripture,
were convinced, however, of the necessity of
some infallible medium through which ** man
might attain to the knowledge of the Christian
6vstem: - They had no more intention of leav
ing the decision of doctrinal points to the un
aided light of man's intellect than the Catholic
church had. '.*,.-
They did not admit as large or as free a field
for the exercise of the powers of the mind as is
enjoyed under the so much aoused but so im
perfectly understood doctrine of the church's
infallibility. -
This is their doctrine: As in the work of
man's salvation all human co-operation is to
be rejected, so also in the interpretation of the
Scriptures the whole work of interpretation is
to be attributed to God. - ; '
Luther discarded all human alloy from his
religious system. According to him the Holy
Spirit reveals to each man the true meaning
and import of the words which he reads. "The
Holy Spirit readeth the Scriptures, not thou."
And in another place, "The believer comes to
the knowledge of the truth instructed, by God
alone. The sense of the sacred . Scriptures was
engendered In the mind," without the aid, as
Zuinglius said, "of human reflection or mental
activity." â ^S^Â«gp|_SÃ^afÃgiiw|llMi^iW > _lM.* iJiiMtfit
This is the first phase of their doctrine re
specting the place the Scriptures hold its Chris
tian theology. : -But, before many years had ]
elapsed the principle of immediate inspiration |
was rejected and the interpretation of the
holy Scriptures made to depend onthe.private !
judgment of the reader unaided by any super-
I natural light. â :â â â¢-'""'â â¢'."..
This is the real state of the controversy,, if !
we except a few sects who still, hold that their
adherents are favored with the immediate in
spiration of the Holy Ghost.
IN CATHOLIC SYSTEM
, We come to the knowledge of our Lord's teach
ing not directly through the Bible, but directly
through the church which interprets the
Bible.
The Catholic church holds the Bible to be
the word of God and that It contains the reve- j
lavions made by Christ to bis apostles; that in
it are to be found those eternal truths, those j
never falling principles of virtue and true
! morality which underlie the Christian sys- I
i tern ; that through it God communes with the :
j sons of men, the majesty of whose inspired j
! language Is only equaled by the sublimity of
i the thought which it conveys. The Catholic
i church holds that the Bible is the "Magna
.Charta"of true liberty and civilization; that
j when its principles cease to be the basis of the
code of laws of any people, that people must
sink into a barbarism as deplorable as that
which existed in the world belore our Lord
came into it. *
But the principles of the Bible are not to be
! admired only, they are to be applied to the re
quirements of man in the various necessities of
'. his nature. They are to be brought home to
! the heart of each individual to shape his
' course of life, to govern and control all his i
i .actions.
In the Catholic system the power which in
| terprets those principles ahd supplies them is
â  the authority of the church, residing in her
I appointed ministers, and not each individual
of the Christian society.
We will study the question more in detail.
j Christ during his life on earth formed a visible
i community of twelve apostles, whom he him
\ self instructed in the truths ,of the religion
which he established.
After his ascension the Holy Spirit de
scended on them, as we read In the Acts of the
: Apostles, filling tnem with the spirit of truth,
alter which they commenced the work of con
verting the nations according to their Master's
injunction, "Go forth into the whole world,
teach all nations, teaching them to observe all i
things whatsoever I have commanded you:
and behold, I am with you all days, even to the
consummation of the world.". They com- j
, menced their mission In Jerusalem. 1
At St. Peter's first sermon three thousand ;
' of his hearers are moved by grace and receive ;
the faith.
ON HIM HAS CHRIST BOLT HIS CHURCH %'.'-.,
And calls him a rock around which the storms '
of persecution might rise. It was never to be â 
snaken. Crowds press around him through
Palestine, listening in breathless silence as ne
explains the doctrines of Christ's new king-:
dom. A potent spell goes over the land, minds

THE VOICE OF ST. PAUL."
Amid the conflicting opinions oi pagan Rome
his voice is heard and in spite ot imperial
edicts ne gathers around nim a band of chosen '
believers. Before half of tne first. century the
faith of Christ is carried to all tne people of the
civilized world. ', .* ".".
This work was accomplished without the aid
of Scriptures. The first book of the New Testa
ment was not written until about ten years
after the Savior's. death, and the last not un
til about the sixty-fifth year of : the first cen- ;
tury. All the churches did not receive all the I
books at the same tfme, nor were many of them
written for the universal church. '
St. Matthew wrote for' the Jews converted to !
Christianity, St. Mark at the request of the
faithful at Rome, St. Luke for the gentiles, St.
John to comply with , the wishes of his friends.
St. Paul's letters were addressed to' particular
Churches. We have his Epistles to the Ro
mans, to the Corinthians, to the Gala and
even to individuals for instance, to Titus, to
Timothy and to Philemon. They were written
to decide local questions, to advise in particu
lar . circumstances, -sometimes .very briefly,
withhelding more ample instruction' till he
would visit them in person.' From the charac- '
ter of the growth of the primitive church It is j
beyond doubt that though I the Scriptures were '
held to be divinely inspired they were not in- |
tended by the inspired writers to bear the
character of a universal law, cor were they in- ;
tended ,to be the only source from which the
world was to derive its knowledge of the re- j
ligion of Christ. Â â  .
What conclusion is to: be drawn from these
facts, which give the history of the spread of
Christianity? The conclusion illustrates and
confirms the doctrine of the Catholic church.
It is this: y : . .;â  ' '?./*.'
A LARGE VISIBLE COMMUNITY EXISTS, :'
Its hierarchy is : complete; its discipline is
every day being more fully developed and per
fected; the voice of its minister is heard every
where; rich and poor -belong to it: men* the j
most learned and men the most illiterate; bar
barous nations that never heard of human
science were won over to its faith.* And as St. :
Irenaius tells us, the work of their conversion
was accomplished "sine charta . et < sine atra
ment" (without paper and without ink)," that ;
is, without learned controversy,' without j the i
reading or profound study of the Scriptures.
. Every part of this vast organism ' Is â¢ working I
in most admirable harmony. The : same faith |
is preached everywhere, it is announced in
Rome ; the same is heard in Athens and Alex- I
andria; St. Paul teaches it in strong and burn- I
ing language; St. John teaches the same doc
trine in words of gentleness and j charity. If
difficulties and disputes respecting doctrinal i
matters arise in any of the churches, the . de- I
cision is referred to those whom Christ has ap
pointed to act in such matters. _Â
. ' -. . SUCH IS THE PICTL'RE . ..
Which history gives us of the primitive church
before the Scriptures were written. Then St.
Matthew wrote his gospel. .-. Years after the
other gospels ; followed. The art of j printing
was unknown.; One or,: two ,. copies; of theoi
were to be found in - the principal . cities.
Passages from them were read on Sundays and I
explained to the faithful. They were edifying
and instructive. Obscure and difficult passages
were interpreted by means of the doctrines al
ready existing and taught in the church. .
The Scriptures themselves were subject to a
rule of faith existing priorjto them, viz. : to the j
authority of the church, to the voice of the i
great Christian I community which has a com- ,
plete organization and over whose doctrinal
decisions the Spirit' of Truth was watching.
Did error arise? Did misunderstanding occur? .
What course â¢ was to be adopted ? r What seems
as most ; likely to I have taken place? | The gen
eral sense decided against the particular; the
sense already received 'against the one newly
broached; the community; against , the indi
vidualâin other words the church interpreted
the Scriptures. . . : " â¢_â -..-... ..
Tbe church is the mythical' body of the
Savior, the â  spouse of Christ, the pillar and
ground .of â  truth. In her Christ lives, i. She is
to preserve pure and unchanged the fairh
committed - to . her care. â¢â¢â â  It was given to her
" long before she received the Scrictures. She
acknowledges them to be Inspired communlca-*

she ; had taught before they were written.
They of 'â¢ necessity must agree -on all points
with her teachings. Â.â¢â¢-
-..'.':â. SHE IS JUDGE IN, MATTERS. OF FAITH.
The authority of the church is the supreme
rule of faith and to It the interpretation of the
Scriptures la submitted. "I would not believe
the gospel," * says r St. Augustine, "unless the
authority of the Catholic church - moved me to
it." * The infallible authority of the church is
therefore the fundamental principle Of Cath
olic theology. ; The Bible <* is infallible in the
sense that ft contains no ; error. But the Bible â¢
is a dead word.-; It cannot. explain the mean
ing that it contains. It cannot interpret itself.
And for this reason, that our faith may be firm
and unchangeable, we acknowledge the neces
sity "of ?an authority superior.; to -- that of any
individual vested with power.not human, but
coming from God, to I teach | man? the truth in
all its purity, to teach the same? truth in all
ages and to all classes.": And this . power is the
church. This doctrine based -on a â  most
rational ground. It is deduced *- from the Very
nature of the church of Christ* '-*- â¢ ' y -/.
â â * Unity of faith is a note of â  the true church,*
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1896.
Our Lord came to bear testimony to the truth.
He embodied that truth in a \ society; which X is
nis church. ' And as thai " truth is * one, , : the
church must also be one. And as that truth
was to be brought to the knowledge of all men,
the church, which is its guardian, must have
its character of c oneness â and 'â ; universality.
From this it follows: This oneness | and iden
tity of proof is preserved for; the human race
only in the Catholic system by the principle of
authority. 'Without this principle the church
would have ceased to exist before the close of
the first century; without it scarcely a vestige
of divine truth would exist at the present day.
The church acted on . this principle from ! the
very beginning of her history. \
v "'*â .-*- y '".A::' THE FIRST HERETICS.' â¢' â  < .<-*
. The first heretics who opposed the Christian
society | quoted Scripture |in . defense , of their
doctrine, doctrines which all Christians of the

repugnant to Christianity, but destructive to
civil society. Yet tnev supported their system
by Scripture texts. . VV hat seems to us In oppo
sition to the Scripture was, according to them,
founded on Scripture. '-'.'â¢ ... - .
Hid the fathers of the church bring a certain
passage to confute them, they proposed an
other. Was a-* learned .*- explanation given
against them, they. had one in reply. -Man
stood against man, the Scripture on both sides.
' What was to be done in the caseâ rather
what was done? Hid the church of the second
century place the Scriptures in the hands of
the faithful that they might discover the
truth? Did she proclaim the principle of
i private judgment? By no means. She told
I them that above the letter of* the Scripture
! there was a higher rule of faithâ the living
j word, the common faith of the church handed
down from -the beginning, with which Scrip
ture must agree and be interpreted in con
| formity with it; that It washers to decide
I when disputes arose, and at her decision all
doubts were to cease. . .- :
THE CHURCH DECIDES. : : . .
After tne Gnostic sects had disappeared new
sects arose. Their adherents marshaled texts
of Scriptures with the same ease and dexterity
as the Gnostics had done in the preceding
j century. 'In due time the church comes forth
j trom her silence and decides. And as centuries
! go by the same manner of proceeding is re-
I peated. Every form of doctrine is propounded.
j Every article of Christian faith is in turn
j rejected. If some maintain that as there is
but one nature in the Trinity so there can be
I but one person, others are found who maintain
; that as there are three persons so there must
i be three natures, if some assert that eternal
life can be gained without supernatural grace,
others are found who assert that grace alone
is sufficient and that man's free will has, no
part in the work of salvation. If some main
tain the eternity of the pains of hell, others de
clare that they are but temporary. Now all sects,
from the Gnostics to those whose origin is of
yesterday, hold the Bible to be the sole rule of
faith, not, Indeed, as it is interpreted by the
competent tribunal of the Christian church,
but by the private judgment of the individual.
That there is a radical defect in a system
which has produced such results, that such a
system is not calculated to preserve the unity
lof Christian faith, but rather, to produce dis
sensions among Christian people, no one can
deny. Such* a system necessarily tends to
create in the intellect uncertainty respecting
the most important truths of the Christian
order, and .is incapable < of uniting in one
Christian society all the members of the human
family who were to be the one fold, and of
which Christ was to be the chief shepherd.
CHRIST, IHE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD,
Never laid an injunction on his followers that
his teachings should be committed to writing.
During the years of -his public ministry he al
ways taught orally. When he commissioned
his apostles to make his teachings known to
all men it was in these words: "Go and teach
all nations whatsoever I have commanded
l you." By the preaching of the word was : di
| vine faith to be produced. . "Faith cometh by
hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ."â
j Rom. x:l7. â  . â¢-...-:
Of the apostles five only are known to have
| writtenâ St. Matthew, St. John, St. Peter, St.
: James and St. Jude. The greater portion of
, the New Testament was written by those who
! did not belong to the apostolic college. Even
l of the five apostles who wrote, three, St. Peter,
| St. James and St. Jude, have left us but a few
short letters written to partlculer churches,
not in obedience to any divine command, but
urged thereto by special and local reasons. If
our Lord had left such a command, would it
not have been very proper, yea, most neces
sary, that his followers should have given the
world a complete exposition of all the doc
trines which Christians should believe?
Wouid it not seem proper - that they should
have come to some understanding among
themselves, and in one gospel, or in one epis
tle addressed to the whole church have enu
merated all the articles oi faith upon which
the Christian system is founded â â â¢*
i : .'--_f Â_. . NOT PREMEDITATED. â¢ A'
But such a course seems to have been far
from their thoughts. If we examine care
fully the four gospels. we find no mention, or
even intimation, . of any premeditated -. plan.
I They seem to be anxious to give the faithful
churches and at the request of the faithful of
I them a few general outlines of our Lord's life
| and actions. St. John, called the* beloved
: apostle, who had rested on the bosom of his
Master, and who, from his close companion
ship ' with him, might seem to have imbibed
more fully than the other apostles the secrets
of his sacred- heart, mentions comparatively
| but few details of our Lord's life and closes
his gospel with the avowal that he had not
; given a complete narrative of it. "But there
are also many other things which Jesus did;
which, if they were written every one, the
world itself, I think, would not be able to con
tain the books that should be written." St.
Luke, in the Acts of the Apostles, relates that
during the forty days which intervened be
tween our Lord's resurrection and ascension,
"He appeared to his apostles and spoke c! the
kingdom of God."
Of how much interest, yea, of how much im
portance to mankind, that they should know
what our Lord had deigned to communicate to
his apostles respecting the kingdom of God.
But, with the bare mention of the fact, the
subject is dismissed by the inspired writer.
What is true of the four gospels is equally true
of the other writings of the New Testament.
They all suppose a Christian society, with a de
fined form of government, with a teaching
power and with an authority to impose belief
In the truths committed to its keeping. St.
Luke, in his Acts of the Apostles, is mainly oc
cupied in chronicling the labors of St. Paul,
and: mentions, but rarely those of St. Peter',
who was recognized by all as the head of the
church. The epistles of St. Paul do not bear
the character of a complete exposition of divine
faith. â  â  ..
NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION.
They were not intended to be published. In
some of them he admits their incompleteness
and expresses his intention of supplementing
them on some future occasion by oral teach
ing. '.':.-â¢.
I If the Holy Scriptures form the sole rule of
faith they would have been complete and
would have been written so clearly > that even
the dullest might, without any difficulty, ap
prehend their, weaning. But such 'is not the
case. The Scriptures are , difficult to under
stand. Without the authority of the church
which explains them no passage of them but
can be made to bear several interpretations.
Do not the many sects into which Protestant-
Ism Is divided bear testimony of the fact? Do
not all of them quote Scripture in their behalf?
Do not all found their teachings * on i one or
other text? A learned German writer says that
the Bible is more "difficult to understand than
the works of Homer, Thucydldes or Polybius,
| and requires a knowledge of Hebrew, Svriao,
i Greek and Latin, as well as a knowledge of
history, geography and even ;of natural sci
ences." â '. â â .-â â â â â¢, 'Â.-â  AA\- y â :â ,:â --. - -..:_â -â

A FALSEHOOD EXPOSED. .-_â â '
You have all heard how during 1500 years
the Catholic Church, kept the Scriptures from
the knowledge of her children; until providen
tially Luther discovered _a i copy of the Bible
chained to the wall of his monastery in Erfurt,
how he broke the chains which bound it, and
read for the first time the pure, unadulterated
word of God. VD'Aubigne' History of the
Reformation," a work widely circulated and
accepted by the. majority of non-Catholic read
ers as an authority on all matters pertaining
to the Protestant Reformation, puts it as an
historical fact that Luther, having had the ad
vantage of a, university education,* did not
know there was such a thing as a Bible until
he * made this astounding j- discovery. * Dr.*
Maitland, in hia work, "The Dark Ages," ex
posed the falsehood, yet it lives on as one
of the stock objections against the Catholic
church. â  â  ... j a .-.-. --;.. ,Â«-;,.:.-.,:..,...,,:'':-â.

Germany before Luther was born. "* These had
issued from Augsburg, Strasburg, Cologne,
Ment? (2), Basle (4), | Nuremberg (10), and were
dispersed throughout Germany before, Luther
was born. -And I may add ' that before that
event there was a printing ; press; at : work in
the very town of Erfurt years after he is said to
have made his 'discovery.' - We > find a young

But there never was and there never will be "
an entire people converted to Christianity by
the sole reading of the Scriptures.^lndividuals
may indeed form from them an exalted notion
of | the Christian system, may entertain a high
respect for its teachings, and' then search j for
that church of which the Scriptures speak,
whose characteristics': they ! give, and J ask of
God. the " grace â¢ to know and follow the truth.
But in an ent re people, with "respect to deter
mining their religious belief and with respect
to i inducing ". them to practice j from motives
of conscience the morality it inculcates, it can
have but little or no effect*. The : letter^ of â  the
gospel Is by Itself â  dead; and â  cau give no life
unless made to live in the great society/called
the church. The Bible is no doubt the word of
God, the book by excellence guarded tby I the
Catholic church, without whose care it would
have been lost long before Luther's time. It Is
the -,'MagualCharta'*,' of our moral greatness
and religious liberties. In it are contained all
the principles whose spirit must be embodied
in the character of every man who lays claim
to high moral character, and in the constitu
tion of every country which makes any preten
sion to progress and civilization. ;. :.y .

to the end of time. It may be said, in a certain
sense, to hold the same place in a religious
society that a constitution does in a civil so
ciety. In the civil order the Government and
constitution ' mutually support each other.
The one gives life, the other applies it ' to : the
various requirements of those who live beneath
its protection. Of what avail, would our con

guarantees, without some form of Government,

::y; : THE CHURCH AND THE BIBLE.
; The church always looked on the Scriptures,
the mind of God revealed in human language,
â  for the spiritual guidance and comfort of his
children, and was anxious in every- age that
they should find in them Instruction and con
solation, ever mindful of the words of St. Paul :
"What things were written, were written for
our learning; that through patience : and the
comfort of the Scriptures we might- have
hope.".:;-;-.-; â -. ::*- .. \
', In one form or another she speaks to her
children In every age, as St. Gregory the Great
wrote in his day: "Be very careful, I beseech
you, my dear brethren, "** to meditate on the
word of God. . Do not neglect the divine writ
ings which are as letters sent to us from our
Creator. ' . l y
â¢ "I beseech you, ; therefore, to apply yourself
to them hereafter with particular affection,
and meditate every day 'on the words of your
Creator." - â - â 
The great Pontiff Pius VI In 1778 writes to
Marteni, Archbishop of Florence, congratula
ting him on his new Italian translation of the
Bible and recommends to the i universal
church the reading of the inspired volume. -A 'â¢-â 
â : "At a time," he writes, "that a vast number of
bad books, which most grossly attack the
Catholic religion, are circulated among the un
learned, to the great destruction of souls, you
judge exceedingly well that the faithful should
be excited to ; the reading' of the Holy Scrip
tures. For these are the most abundant
sources which ought Jo be left open to every
one to draw from them purity of morals and of
doctrine." y â â¢.;; â â  ; y,/ ; â¢ -;. .
CHERISHED THE SCRIPTURES.
The Third Council of Baltimore, in its pas
toral letter to the Catholics of the United
States, repeats the admonition. .
7 "It can hardly be necessary for us to remind
you, beloved brethren, that the mom highly
valued treasure of every - ; family library and
the most frequently and lbvlngly made use of
should be the Holy Scriptures. We hope that
no family can be found among us without a
I correct version of the Holy Scriptures." -
; Thus the church that carries down the ages
the doctrines and graces of her Divine Founder
has always cherished the sacred writings of
the old and the new dispensation, and under
the guidance of the Holy Spirit draws out of
them those sacred truths of which they are the
depositary and applies them : to the needs of
souls. â¢ â¢â¢::.- Â:
Her history, from Peter to Gregory, from
Gregory to Pius VI, from Pius to Leo XIII, is a
record of unfailing loyalty to the revealed
Word of God, and of constant effort to bring its
inestimable treasures to the knowledge of her
children. Â , -- - - â 
ABUSE OF THE BICYCLE
Dr." Abrams Says Women Have
an Esthetic Right to
Wear Pants.
Doctors Who Ride the Bike Advocate
the Practice; Those Who Do
. Not, Oppose It.
"The Use and Abuse of the Bicycle" was
the topic and Dr. Albert Abrams the
speaker at the popular lecture at the Cooper
Medical College last evening.
Dr. Abrams Said : **').:.' A' â¢ - .<<
I Â« It is apposite on St. Valentine's eve to talk of
the object of one's love, therefore I think it ap
propriate to talk to lovers of the bicycle.* Tom
Reed has said- that the chief question of the
day is, "How -to dodge . the bicycle." I have
been asked to pronounce the name of the popu
lar means of locomotion, and I replied that it
was harmless. That is my attitude toward the
use ot the bicycle. I mean to cure 1 you of the i
abuse of the wheel, for only the good Lord can
cure of the use of it. Indeed, it is fully appre
ciated that the greatest danger from the bi
cycle is to the pedestrian rather than the rider. |
| Here ';. the lecturer 'explained I that the
proper pronunciation of the mooted word
is with- the long "y." Continuing, :he
said that a generation ago a divine would
have been excommunicated if he had
mounted the wheel. '' .' ', y
; .Wheeling/ is too, healthful and too time
saving an exercise to be made light of, so
long as a bicyclist keeps his feet wnere.they
belong â on | the pedals. Coasting is the perni- j
clous phase of riding. The policemen in |
Golden Gate Park should not permit the prac- i
tice. The symposium on "Spinal Meningitis !
the Result of Cycling" recently published
proved that the- physicians who ride advocate
the practice, and those who walk oppose
it. It is a fact, however, that the vibration
generated by the exercise is beneficial..
We hear a good, deal about the "bicycle
face." - Don't trouble about that. It is said of
Anglo-Saxons that -they take their pleasures I
sadly.? If a bicyclist's l'ece does j not wear the
smiling vacuity that passes in society for
amiability, he looks himself ' at any rate. The
serious expression he wears Is the reflection of
his thoughts about i his neighbor who knows
not the bicycle. It is well he wears something
in these days of dress reform. . ...
Dr. Abrams. thought the "bicycle foot"
was an imaginary ill. :He continued : :._>
i Cycling will make the thin fat and the fat
thin. c It ; promotes â¢; outdoor exercise, which,
physicians concede, cures half the ills to which
flesh I and â  especially , nervous I flesh , is heir to.
It ,is a tonic most; constitutions need. The
popular rest cure is, in most: cases, a misappli
cation of a law of nature. Nervous prostrates
need moderate exercise Instead of rest. : â â 
A good rule is to dismount and walk up hill
when riding is likely to be irksome. ;
' Care in the selection of a saddle in the choice
of the right posture will remove the danger of
injury to the frame. . -..ââ - ;_*-:,., â¢
The bicycle hump is by no means a necessary
result of the exercise. As well criticise horse
back riding because of the unnatural posture
of the jockey in riding. â *.-; Â».-.;!. r - .
â¢" Cycling may, even -be of .benefit In i certain
cases of heart trouble, as for instance fatty de
generation. - :;',-'â ' 'â 'â "; ' :-: "â¢â .-.â -â  :,:,"' .... '
} And now we come to the absorbing topic of
woman and the bicycle. -If the new woman
comes t with a tendency to physical perfection
let us accord her a royal; welcome. i Dr. Roose
velt has disposed of the vexed question in the
following sententious I manner: "Bicycling is
good for some women all times and all women
sometimes, but not for : all women all the
time." -.^ v ..'-..'.V:.' â ":'. --.. ".-.V - â '.-' - ; -' ;. ii
{Dr.; Abrams .claimed that women have
not only a historic and hygienic, but
esthetic right to wear pants.
j Referring to the I strong remedial effect
of exercise in the open air the professor
said : ,-â¢ , , ;.;.â¢ . .
'"In" Chicago, that city of busy men and rest
less women, there are 35,000 persons addicted
to hypodermic Injections : of , opium or | other
sedatives affected by many who lead a nervons,
overwrought life. Yet j the .testimony of phy
sicians is that the number is being very much
reduced ' through the. prevalence of cycling.
"Fiends" find that - cycling is.a better cure for
insomnia than opium.

-The Southern Pacific Company of Ken
tucky * has a ' roundabout , way of doing
things to reach a result . that ,is satisfac
tory to it. In some cases it will go clear
around several blocks to accomplish its
ends.
A sample of its methods is visible in tbe
case of the Oak-street cable line, most of
which' is at the present time lying idle
and quiet in full possession of the street.
J' ? When the franchise for the Oak-street
line was granted the road was to run from
Howard and Tenth to Market, across Mar
ket to Fell, on Fell to Franklin, then
on Franklin â¢to Oak street and out
Oak to Stanyan. At the present time, ;
however, the service has been cut off from
Tenth and Howard streets to Fillmore,
and the unused line . confronts the
residents of Oak street with the
fact that their property is diminishing in
value, owing to the removal of the ser
vice. '. ..â .'. - yj':=:
Frank J. Sullivan, one of the largest
property-owners in the district, has been
interesting himself in the matter for some
time, but has been unable to get anything
like satisfaction from the company, y-'y.
"When the cars were taken off, some
three months ago," said Mr. Sullivan
yesterday, "I took it upon myself to see
what could be done toward re-establishing
some: sort of service for residents and
property-holders who had interests along
the line. Three other gentlemen, Judge
Goewy, M. P. Jones and "Michael Maegher,
and' myself, all having property in that
section, went before Mr. Vining, the pen
eral manager of the Market-street Railway
Company, and put the matter before him,
urging that the stopping of the line on
even* a -portion of the street was working
considerable injury to the property-owners
and residents. yWe argued that the com
pany could not abandon a portion of its
franchise without abandoning all of it. It
seems,- though," that such conditions can
prevail without any particular discomfort
to the company.
"He showed us the statement of earnings
of the Oak-street line, which was some
thing like $190 a day, while the Market
and Mission lines earned over $900. Mr.
Vining said the small: returns were what
occasioned the change, but .promised' to
give the matter immediate attention upon
( the return of Mr. Crocker from 5 , the ; East.
From the conversation held at that: time
I, in company with |my associates, left
under the impression that it would be
agreeable to the company to run an electric
line out Oak and back to Market via Page
street. This would have been satisfactory
to the people out that way, and when Mr.
Crocker returned I wrote him a letter as
follows:
â  *-â  *;>.-:>- :%ââ¢ y: June 17, 1895.
Charles F. Crocker Esq.. Cityâ Dearth*: a few
weeks ago several owners of Oak-street prop
erty, including myself, called on Mr. Vining to
ascertain definitely what your company pro
pose to do with the Oak-street caole road. We
referred to Its abandonment of the line between
Fillmore and Franklin streets. We pointed
| out to Mr. Vining the great Injury that would
I result to all. property values, , and estimated
the same to be at least 60 per cent. , We stated
that one line on Oak street and another on
) Page street, tapping the Market and Mission
! street roads, would be satisfactory to all own-
I ers and residents of the district. He promised
to give us a final decision when you returned.
: On behalf of all parties interested, I trust
] that you will decide tbe proposition as soon
j as possible. As it is, every one is at sea and
i property values suffer. Yours very truly, â¢
Frank Sullivan.
"Mr. Crocker replied to this letter imme-
I diately and said that, the matter would
! have to be placed before the directors.
j Nothing has been done since then and we
| are waiting to Bee what the next move
will be.". ;â¢â  'â -'â -;-' ' ' ' '"'â - ; \-" - *
"The way things stand now the : fran
chise should be revoked, as they do not
live up to its letter. â  The street is in such
i a condition-that no one else would care to
! put a road on it, as the residents ; desire,
j owing to the fact that but a portion of it
j has been J abandoned. *It is in no shape to
receive another road ! managed by another
I company and it simply stands to-day in
| the clutches of the corporation. ,
â¢ "When property-buyers invested money
j in the, neighborhood of Oak street it was
j pretty well understood* that the streetcar
service was ,to prevail, but because S the
company; does not coin a small fortune
' there it has been taken away and -the peo
ple are suffering considerable loss and in
convenience from it.":
Henry Mayer, the Sutter-street tailor,
discussed the matter in the same way and
said that an injunction should be put on
the electric road running from Fillmore
out to the park and that the entire fran
chise should : be canceled immediately; 'A
meeting is soon to be called - for the pur
pose of getting at the bottom of the deal,
and; property-holders will be called upon
to sign a protest against the high-handed

The class of mendicants known as "dis

trar, presided, and among those - present
were the Rev. W. G. Elliott, Mrs. If. E.
Kincaid, Miss A Vireinia ** Fitch, : Captain
Eldridge, Osgood Putnam and S. M. Levy.
â¢It was remarked that for a ' long time
past t: persons . have been - receiving - free
medical treatment at the Cooper Medical
College and the San Francisco Polyclinic,
.who were â¢! in no proper ; sense ;â  objects of
charity. '; One of the ladies present said she
had heard of people having property to the
extent of $50,000 and over, who "ecru pled
not to play thÂ« "pauper when unwell in
order to get free treatment. '-.The surgeons
at- length /complained' of the extra work,
and bdjh institutions have arranged with
the Associated Charities to investigate the
financial standing of applicants for relief.
Mr. Flint reported that the visits of
tramps to the t-ociety's rooms had fallen
off to a notable degree. The society, it
appears, has opened jan extensive | wood
yard, wherein healthy, male applicants for
aid are sure of . .unlimited; ax and hatchet

This mode of. 'relief, seems by no* means

said the woodyard was in a languishing

Governments, Physicians, Sci-

African Nut.
THE ESSENCE - " OF ENERGY.
A Food Medicine Used by Troops in
' Marching, by Athletes and by
y .Invalids..
â¢ In American army circles much interest
has been exhibited recently in the qua I-
ties of an African nut, : known botamcally
ns sterculia, products of which are known
in this country as Ko afra. This nut .*?!;!
attracted wide attention in the scientific
world on account of its remarkable tome
and sustaining powers, which enable
those who use it to perform physical tasks
otherwise impossible; Already the armies
of France and Germany have used the
product and. have found that its extra-
ordinary qualities have made it an indis-
pensable adjunct to their equipment. -
The reports concerning this nut and .its
I health-giving Qualities by the most famous
i of German arid French physicians and
I scientists, together with the success scored
in the use by the athletes of Yale and other
colleges, are' forerunners which herald its
introduction* as immediate and general.
Certainly if these recent reports are trust-
worthy the success of the article is already
[ assured, ;.'â '.' ._.Â«.â¢__ ..
Its value to soldiers and athletes results
I from the fact that it.prevents fatigue and
increases muscular power, enabling the
; user to perform hard and painful tasks
with ease. ... T .*.
Superintendent Morgan of the Letter
Carriers' Division of the New York Post-
office has recommended a thorough test of
the extract by the army of letter carriers
of the New York Postoffice. .In accord-
ance with SuDerintendent Morgan's sug-
gestion John M. Parsons, president of the
Letter Carriers' Association, has con-
ducted ' tests which have been attended
with the most satisfactory results. "I
have tried Vino-Kolafra," said Mr. Mor-
gan,, "and have found it to be undoubtedly
a good thing. We have letter carriers in
the New York Postoffice engaged in collec-
tion work who have to make eight â¢ trips a
day of sixty blocks per trip, or twenty-four
miles daily. These carriers ' have more
arduous work to do at the present time
; than soldiers.and, therefore,' Vino-Kolafra
is just the thing for them. It is especially
valuable for letter carriers with long
routes, on account of its sustaining prop-
erties, but of course it is of value to all
who do any hard work."
Kolafra appears to be a non-intoxicating
stimulant,* which differs from other stimu-
lants in that it adds at once to the sum
total of nervous force available for use, in-
stead of merely enabling. the immediate
(and perhaps wasteful) expenditure of
energy drawn in advance from what will
be needful for the requirements of to-
morrow. In other words, no reaction at-
tends its use. It is a cash deposit, not a
discounted draft. . .
In the form of Vino-Kolafra it conserves,
not merely shifts energy; it becomes a fly-
wheel to the human engine, restraining
the excessive action of the superexcited and
bringing the sluggish up to a normal speed.
. For this reason the medical journals are
recommending its use to the weak, ex-
hausted and convalescent. In addition, it
acts as a prompt antidote to the effects of
| alcohol and satisfies the craving for, liquor
I and for morphine, etc, without causing
I any injurious effects.
The same qualities render it useful to the
j invalid. The uses of Vino-Kolafra, the
i most convenient form of preparing the nut
in order to preserve its full stimulant and
tonic value, are indicated by the following :
The New England Medical Monthly
states editorially: "The medical pro-
fession in these sections has lone recog-
nized in it a great aid in performing feats
of labor, tests of strength, or sustaining
life in disease. Aside from its value to the
brain and muscle worker it is invaluable in
the sick room ; it helps tide over the crises
in disease and sustain the strength, of. a
disease-exhausted system. . In shocKS due
to accidents, traumatism, operations, syn-
cope or fright, it is of great value, and will
prove the surgeon's friend, as well as the
physician's. In nervous prostration and
nervous irritation it is of inestimable
value. It is efficacious in ' cardiac affec-
tions, especially smoker's heart."
; The Quarterly Therapeutic Review says
of the sterculia (botanical name) nut: "It
is said , to remove directly the stupidity
and unsteadiness of drunkenness. It is an
excellent. nerve tonic and will enable a
man to go without food and support great
fatigue for twenty-four hours or more. It
is a wonderful tonic and stimulant. When
used regularly sleep is sound and restful,
while a feeling of brightness and activity
i 3 prevalent during the waking hours. It
is.* a . cardiac and cerebral stimulant. In
migraine : and nervous headaches it has
been repeatedly proved to be beneficial.
Its results in the treatment of neuras-
thenia, diarrhea and seasickness have been
good. In torpidity of the liver it excites
that organ and accelerates the flow of bile.
In indigestion it promotes alimentation
by dissolving the mucous clots and remov-
ing debris from the intestines. In short,
it is the safety valve of bodily mechanism,'
preserving and restoring energy and utiliz-
ing tissue waste. In this respect it differs
vastly from all other beverages and stimu-
lants in that it preserves latent energy, ob-
taining its powers by -utilizing the waste
of solid tissue matter."
Dr. E. B. Smith,' president of the Wayne
County Medical Society, says: "It aug-
ments the secretion of the digestive fluids.
It helps in overcoming the indigestion
common to drunkards, and is of excep-
tional value in delirium tremens." --
Professor Edouard Heckel of the Paris
Medical Faculty says: "This seed is an
intestinal tonic without parallel. It is the
greatest gastro-intestinal tonic that the
therapeutic arsenal can place in the hands
of its practitioners." He recommends its
use in tubercular diarrhea," where there is
intestinal ulceration. ". / â¢"
General Alexander Stephen, British
Consul at Bahia, Brazil, in comparing the
physical merits of ; the West African negro
and the : Brazilian negro, says that the
great powers of endurance and strength of
the African, exhibited in lifting and trans-
porting heavy loads, passes all efforts on
the part? of the Brazilian. For instance,
where it takes eight Brazilian ' negroes to
carry a load , with . difficulty four African
porters carry it .cheerfully, singing as they
ascend a hill and chanting the whole time
as they trudge along. As the discharging
of vessels is paid for by . weight, the Afri-
can '*. gang, which â  has less hands, earns
twice as much, and while they hoard and
save the Brazilian porter lives ' from hand
to mouth, spending his money for rum, in
the vain _ belief ', that it fits "him i for his
laborious task, while the African invests
bis t spending allowance in seeds of the
sterculia, which are not intoxicating, act
as ..a -nutritive; quench thirst and pro-
duce vigor and freshness. !
Dr. Cyrus Edson, formerly president of
the New York Health Board, in the New
York Tribune of October 26, says of this
remedy : j"I have used it in my practice
for over a year and a half to bridge over
that frequent gap in treatment which is
met with in cases of prolonged illness. .Of
all the stimulants known it is the most
powerful, and is at the same time abso-
lutely harmless. yln * cases of acute ; dys-
pepsia, in convalescence, etc., it has beeu
worth its weight in gold."
; In the same article Dr. J. G. Johnson, a
prominent Brooklyn Heights -physician,
says: "I have been familiar with the vir-
tues of this nut for some time, but it is
only recently that I have been able to pro-
I cure a", reliable â¢ preparation ! of it. It is
[ known as Vino-Kolafra, .and is manufac-
tured. with great care by the firm of .John-
son & Johnson of No. 92 William street,
New York. It gives prompt and perma-
nent strength: to the body, is -i an aid to

an emphatic "no," would have answered them
more satisfactorily to your readers, and would ;
have cost him the expenditure of a correspond
ingly less amount of time and labor.
Those, however, who have troubled them
selves to wade through the superabundant
supply of words which the learned gentleman
has seen fit to inflict upon you during the last
few months have realized that he has to a large '
degree the gift of talking for a long time with
out saying anything. They have, too, dis- '
cerned the purpose of his .useless multiplica- â 
lion of wordsâ the production upon his readers
of a frame of mind in which, after perusing one
of his articles, they will be compelled to asK.
"Where is be at. anyway?" To answer that
question requires a study of bis effusions and I
an analysis of his statements which few of
your readers have time to mate, the only lncid
ideas to be acquired without such study being
that he is "roasting" somebody and that he is
"forninst" the A. P. A.
A RUBBISH HEAP.
In his controversy with Dr. Wendte, Rev.
Yorke established what ha was pleased to term
his "rubbish heap." Following his example, :
with your permission, I .-hall establish a rub
bish heap. And to this I shall relegate all
matters which, though found in Rev. Yorke's
letters, are not relevant to the issues. Such .
matters must, perforce, include all personali
ties, all Impertinent assumptions as to the '
principles or practice of the American Protec- i
live Association, and all unofficial interpreta
tions oi the order's position or objects, even
including the interpretations of the Very
Learned and Very Reverend the Chancellor of
the Archdiocese of San Francisco. That I am
right in so rejecting his interpretations is
manifest from the words of the Chancellor
himself, spoken on the occasion of his lecture
at Metropolitan Temple on the evening of Feb
ruary 3, 1596:
No one has a right to judge of the teachings of
the Catholic church by the Interpretation of Its '
enemies.
Paraphrasing his remarks, we say "No one
has a right to judge of the teachings of the
American Protective Association by the inter- i
pretations of its enemies."
"TIRADES AGAINST THE A. P. A. â¢ .
In glancing over Mr. Yorke's article I find ;
that he has added to his alleged answers to my |
thirty-one questions twenty-nine separate and '
distinct tirades of unexampled - bitterness â 
against the A. P. A., which occupy 200 lines of j
type or nearly a column of solid matter. These !
tirades are made up of impertinent assumption j
and unsupported, statements concerning the
A. P. A., and as such 1 shall relegate them to
the rubbish heap, for they contain the thing
which is not. Also, inasmuch as I know the
value of newspaper space, I shall, when quot
ing Mr. Yorke's replies, omit these vitupera
tive attacks, merely indicating them by a
phrase in parenthesis "Tirade Against the '
A. P. A." But to our mutton.
The first half column of Father Yorke's letter
contains little, if anything, of value. j I may
have '-paraded with a chip on my shoulder."'
If so, the chip is there no longer, since the
Irish-American chancellor has not been able to !
resist the temptation peculiar to his blood, but
has knocked it off. Father Yorke may not have
sympathized- with my "impatience for a re
ply. Dr. WÂ«ndte may or may not have given
the chancellor the "marble heart" and the
"stony stare," and the priest's reply that I en
gage in controversy with him "is equally
irrelevant, and all these I mast "relegate to
the rubbish heap.".
Coming, then, to the more serious portion of
his communication, Father Yorke says:
The Rev. Sir. Hudeison opens his communica
tion with a statement that "the principles of any
Individual largely, If not wholly, determine his
character." This statement Is very true, if we are
dealing with an honest and consistent Individual.
Very true. Mr. Yorke continues:
It is very false if we are dealing with a hypocrite
or a fraud.
This statement is a sophism, and is not true.
The principles of an honest man are honest.
Those of a fraud, whatever may be his preten
sions, are fraudulent. Therefore the state
ment "The principles of any individual largely,
if not wholly, determine his character" is true,
whether one is dealing with an honest man or
with a fraud.
The sophistry which I have just made clear
is of a subtle, plausible kind, which has always
characterized the polemlsts and and the apolo
gists of the Roman church, and it. is not sur
prising to find it thus early in that organiza
tion's latest champion. And because the
sophistry is of so plausible a character it is the
more dangerous. â  â  .
Mr. Yorke continues:
The advertised principles of Uriah Heap were
fa* different, from the principles on which he acted.
So the advertised principles of the A. P. A. may be
far different from those which animate its mem
bers. â  '* -yy
A saving "may" which keeps the statement
within the bounds of truth! Yes, Mr. Yorke,
the principles of the A. P. A. as an organiza
tion may be far different from those which
animate its individual members. So, also, the
principles of the Roman church may be very
different from those which animate its indivi
dual priests or which caused them to enter the
priesthood in the first place. A man may join
the A. P. A. for political reasons. He may join
the Catholic church thinking to increase his
business. One may join the A. P. A. from
motives of the purest patriotism and another
enter its fold for the sole reason that the
Roman ehuTCh opposes it. Thomas Aquinas,
whom Father Yorke is so fond of quoting, may
have entered the priesthood for reasons far
different irom those which may have actuated
the present chancellor of San Francisco. ' Â»
Father Yorke continues:
When a man comes . before us with a. set of
maxims and with the claim that he lives up to
them, we test his claim by his deeds. -
We do in the A. P. A., at least. Father Yorke
continues:
When a society apDears before the public and
asks for support because it professes certain prin- .
ciples It is the first duty of the public to consider
how far these principles are put In practice by the
society. â¢ y
This _ false. Father Yorke has, as usual,
put the cart before the horse. ,It is the first '
duty of the public not to "consider how far
these principles are put in practice,*' but to
consider first the principles whether they be
good or bad. And A do not think that "Mr.
Yorke's misplacement of his wagon is other
than purposed, for the one thing of all others
â  which he does not wish to discnss'is "whether
the principles of the A. P. A. arc good or had."
This, too, because he knows those principles
are unimpeachable, and he does not wish to be
forced to admit that "any good thing can come
out of Nazareth." â¢ ,C v " '
Father Yorke continues:
Hence it is that the A. P. A. platform cuts but
little figure In such it discussion as" this. The as
sertions, In the declarations, of principle, are so.
loosely constructed chat they may mean anything or
nothing. As they lie, there is very little to distin
guish them from the platforms of the I two parties
to which the great hulk of -the citizens of this
country, Protestants and . Catholics, give ; their ad
hesion. WKSs3%^B-9BMWSBSs--9ffW!SSBSSi
If the principles "are so loosely' constructed
that they may mean anything or nothing." Is â¢
it not a little odd that Father Yorke is enabled
to state that "there is very little to distinguish
them from the platforms to which the â  great
bulk of the citizens of this country, Protestants
and Catholics, give 'their adhesion?"- And if
there is so little to distinguish them from the
platforms of political parties*, it would seem to
an unprejudiced observer that that fact ,is
prima facie evidence that the organization's
purposes have to do with politics, and not with
religion, as Father: Yorke asserts. If there
r _ all >' he such little difference, it seems strange
that Father Yorke considers it worth his while
to so bitterly attack the A. P. A. when he ap
parently has no quarrel with either Republi
canism or Democracy.
Father Yorke continues:
Hence, there is no need of answering the multi
i tudinous questions which the Rev. Mr. Hudeison
i taiks on tin- A. P. A. platform.
Hence ! Why, Father Yorke, your logic Is be
coming as obscure as you assert A. P. A. prin
cles to be.
Father Yorke continues:
To many of them I will give assent, and to none
of them am I compelled by any principle of my
religion to answer no. y ; y. :.*-. * . Â-.-.:
. Note this, please, Mr. Editor, for I shall quote
it frequently. Referring to my questions Mr.
lorke says: "To many of them 1 will give as
sent, and to none of them am I compelled by
any principle of my religion to answer no."
Mr. Yorke continues:
However, though the operation Is perfectly need
less. It may be just as well to take up the questions
one by one and say my say about them. _ â¢>-â¢<;-â¢
"So glad, deah boy !" So kind of you to put
yourself to such needless trouble. And now,
inasmuch as you have taken up my "questions
one by one and said your say about them," let
us analyze your remarks and see what you
really have said after all.
question 1.
"Does Mj*. Yorke deny that politics need purify
ing, or does he object to their purification
Yorke's answerâ l have not, the slightest objec
tion to the purification of politics, and I believe
I that pure politics should be the ideal of even- good
citizen. The. extent of the need Is a matter on .
which lam not competent to judge. I know, how
ever, that a secret political society can never
bring about pure politics. (Tirade against the
A. P. A.) Aj. i
To the first question Father Yorke. answers
"No." He is no: opposed to purity in politics.
Therefore, so far as that" principle is con
] cerned, the father approves of the A. P. A. -
And Father Yorke is "forninst" secrecy.
! Please note that, too, Mr. Editor, for 1 shall
i have something ito say about secrecy before I
i am through, : :.
QUESTION 2.
"Does Mr. Yorke object to our attacking any re
, ligious organization attempting to become a factor
i in politics?" â 'â¢ -.
Father Yorke's answerâ l object to no on* at
: tacking any religious organization which attempts
to become a factor in politics. lam firmly of
. ! the opinion that no religious organization should
meddle in politics. I believe i that such meddling
will pioduce bad politics and worse religion. (Tirade
against the A. P. A.). '
Fatner Yorke has no objection to the second
principle of the A. P. A. In fact, he approves
. it, though he is even more radical than that
organization. . For he talks about "bad poli
tics and worse religion," while tho A. P. A. re
; fuses to say anything about the effect on re
ligion. Bravo! Father. We are doing fa
mously. We have found two points of agree
ment, though you are - still "forninst" the
i A. P. A. â¢
By the way, Father Yorke, you stated that
.to many of my questions you would "assent
and to none of tnem are you compelled by any
' principle of your religion to answer no.'"' To
which of my many questions are you going to
assent? You have answered ' 'no ' so far.
. question 3. . * â¢
"Is Mr. Yorke hostile to our aim to preserve and
maintain the Government against all foreign in
; fluences?"
Father Yorke's answer: Mr. Yorke believes in
the .Mom oh doctrine for the United States as well
as for Venezuela. I believe, howeverâ . (Tirade
against the A. P. AO Â,,..
How nice! Mr. Yorke does not disapprove;
therefore, he . approves. Therefore, in his
opinion, the A. P. A. is all right on this point.
; Three points for approval and he hasn't as
sented to a question yet, though "no principle
of his religion compeils him to answer no."
question 4. â¢ â¢
"Does Mr. Yorke - regard religio-political organi
zations as friends to civil and religious liberty?"
Father Yorke's answerâ He does not. I believe
' that religio-political organizations are as hostile to
the American spirit as they are to the plain pro
visions of the constitution, and (Tirade against the
A. I*. A.)
And still Father Yorke and I agree. Dear,
dear! I thought this was going to be a contro
versy, and here it is degenerating into a reg
ular love feast mutual admiration society,
as it were. By the way, Father Yorke, are you
sure this is not one of the many questions to i
' which you are going to assent? â¢
question 5.
"Is It not. In Mr. Yorke's opinion, unsafe and !
: unwise to put in otlice men who owe allegiance to
a foreign power?"
Father l'orke's answerâ l think this country Is I
! strong enough to hold that such a policy might j
i not be unsafe, but I am decidedly of opinion that :
;it is unwise and unnecessary. (Tirade.) â¢ . - ;
The father does not quite agree with the iA. |
I P. A. on this point. He thinks the country is i
: strong enough to do some very unwise things, j
' just as a healthy, robust man may sit around
j in his wet clothes after a rain. But he consid
, ers it "very unwise and unnecessary," so I
I think on the -whole we. agree, and I must
"tally one" for harmony.
'- QUESTION 6.
"Is Mr. Yorke an enemy of the free public school
system, and does he favor supplanting it with a
sectarian institution?''
Father Yorke's answer âHe Is not and he
"does not. I believe in a free public school system, !
I and lam not in favor 'of supplanting It with a j
sectarian system. I believe that the schools to !
which the members of all sects contribute should
be entirely non-sectarian. (Tirade against A. P. A.)
Better and better I Who would have thought
Father Yorke was such a friend to the public
schools And I suppose he could prove it,
j since he asserts he can prove every assertion
he has made. I wonder how he would do it?.
: AA ~'CA:.'A: - - ' QUESTION 7. ; ' -._,,..
"Does Mr. Yorke oppose protecting our citizen
laborers from European pauper and criminal
labor, and Is he hostile to honest and educated
Immigrants who ' propose becoming American citi
zens, and* who will. forswear allegiance to every
foreign power?" â¢
Father . Yorke's I answerâ l strongly favor pro
tecting our citizen laborers, not only from Eu
ropean * pauper and : criminal labor, but also from
-Canadian' paupers and New Brunswick. (Tirade
against the A. F. A.) ."
Again Father Yorke approves of a principle
: of the A. F. A. : And yet. he still answers no to
my . question. His "assent to eeveral ques
tions" seems dwindling. y'A,y
'...â â ' question 8.
"Does Mr. Yorke oppose putting into office hon
est and true men, patriots who are qualified and
who owe allegiance solely to the stars and
stripes?" -
Father Yorke's answerâ l believe that there is
no. man too honest, no man too true, no man too
patriotic for even the smallest position of .trust
under the American Government. 1 oppose' put
ting into office political preachers. character!
sbyst-rs, physicians without practice, business
men without credit, politicians without principle,
demagogues without education ana bigots without
sense. (Tirade.)
How nicely the father phrases the A. P. A.
principle. "No man too honest, no man too
true, no man too patriotic." I'm sure that he
must approve the organization which from the
beginning of its existence bad this plank in its
platform, and I am surprised that he has not
ere this applied for membership.
question 9. .
"Is Mr. Yorke hostile to loyalty to true Ameri
canism, which knows neither birthplace, race,
creed nor party, as a first requisite for membership
in our organization?" â¢â â â¢â * '. |
" Father Yorke's < answerâ depends. .The
Native Sons' organization takes note of birthplace.
The Scotch-Irish organizations take note of race.
The Methodist ; organizations take note of creed.
The Republican organization takes note of party.
If an organization Is supposed to | cultivate Ameri
canism without regard to these points there is no
reason why 1 should be hostile to it. (Tirade.)
How deftly Father Yorke dodges the issue!
I ask him if he is "hostile to loyalty to true
Americanism, Vwhich knows neither birth
place, race, creed nor party, as a first requisite
lor membership In ; any organization?" He
replies that he is not hostile to several organi- i
zations which take note of one or more of these
points. ) He | adds I that -if an I organization *is
supposed to; cultivate Americanism without j
regard to these points, there is no reason why I
he should be hostile to it. Of course there is no '
reason why he should be hostile to It. But j
you will notice that | ho did not state whether
or not he is hostile. ' Furthermore, you. will
notice that I distinctly asked him whether or
not he was hostile to juch Americanism "as a'
qualification for membership in any society."
And he has just as distinctly dodged the issue.

ways a "but" In the way."- "But" if our favorite
were the man of his choice I suppose it would

claims equal if not greater . sovereignly than the

Father Yorke's replyâ l go further. I believe
that . subjection to any ecclesiastical power which
claims a jot or tittle of sovereignty within the ter
ritory of these United states is irreconcilable with
citizenship, andâ (Tirade against the A. P. A.) ;

âthe spirit of which the British officer on Bos

breathe it." , 5 ..
question 13. yAAyyAA
"Is Mr. Yorke hostile to the upholding of the
constitution of the United States, and its guaran
tee of religious liberty In tt.e individual?"
Father Yorke's replyâ have sworn .to . uphold
the . constitution .of the United States, and to no
principle of American. polity do I render more
ready allegiance than to that of religious liberty.
Butâ (Tirade against the A. P. A.) v
Mr. Yorke again dodges the question. I ask
him if he is "hostile to the upholding of the
constitution,", and he asserts that ,he has
"sworn to uphold It." That is not an answer
to my question. He may have sworn to up
hold It, and yet be hostile to certain of its pro
visions. It miÃht.be pertinent to inquire how
much religious liberty he thinks is enjoyed by
children who â . are cooped up in parochial .
schools and taught only wnat seems advisable .
to a Romanish priest. ...',_
question 14.
"Is Mr. Yorke hostile to our position that the
non-sectarian free public i schools is the bulwark of
American Institutions, and does he claim that it is
not the best place for the education of American
children?"
Father Yorke's replyâ l believe that our free
public school system Is a necessity to the con
tinuation and prosperity of our people. That it is
the bulwark of our institutions I am not prepared
to say, for _ remember that our .institutions
were established and , flourished fifty years
before j there was -, ai . free public ! school â¢ sys
tem. I believe, too, that if by any con
tingency (wnich God forbid) our public school
system ceased to exist, American freemen would
still be found able to defend American institutions.
The best place for the education of American
children is where patriotic and conscientious par
ents chose to send them. The private schools of
the past gave to America the greatest, patriots and
the greatest statesmen in her. history, and I de
cline to admit that the private schools of the pres
ent are in any degree inferior. Freedom of teach
ing and a healthy rivalry between State. institu
tions and private enterprise are the true American
ideas in the matter of education. - (Tirade against -
the A. P. A.)
Here Father Yorke and I disagree. He will
not admit that the public schools are the bul
wark 'of 'American 'institutions nor does he
consider them the best place for the education
of American children. He says the "best place
for the education of American children is
where conscientious and patriotic American
parents chose to send them." v That means, of
course, parochial schools for Catholic children*
But Mr. Yorke, in order not to appear as an
antagonist of the public non-sectarian schools,
starts his answer with : the statement that he
'â¢believes that our free public-school system is
a necessity to the continuation and prosperity
of our people." How much of this campaign
matter is to be taken seriously may be judged
from the statement a little further, on that he
believes that if our "public school system
ceased to exist American freemen would still
be found able to defend American institu
tions." '
Will Mr. Yorke answer a question? Is not
the non-sectarian free public school an Ameri
can institution? And. will he explain how
"American freemen" could "still defend" this
one of America's institutions if it had ceased
to exist? â "..â ' . â¢' â  ' .
question 15.
Is Mr. Yorke hostile to the principle which con
dems the support from the public treasury of any
sectarian school, reformatory or other institution
. not under the public control ?
j Father Yorke's replyâ l object to the appropria- I
! tion of public, money for . sectarian teaching. j
' (Tirade.)
[ Ido not see, however, why tne State should not .
| support, feed, clothe and maintain Its dependent ]
I classes' in Institutions under sectarian control if
| such support costs less and is more humanizing
than any which can be otherwise provided. The
! experience of California is not such as to Induce a
taxpayer to experiment with any more State In
stitutions.
Moreover, the dependent children of the |State
have as much right to a religious education as the
children of the rich. If the. State refuses to the
orphan what the citizen gives his child, the State
is making an invidious distinction between the
fortunate and , the unfortunate. I do not think
that Americans have yet come to that point when
, they will deny to the boy or the girl who has been
bereft of parents that .religious teaching which
they give their own little ones. . (Tirade against the

IN THE JEANNETTE DRIFT.

Pole. : 'fv"\y-^
THE RELICS FOUND IN THE ICE.
- .* * â  * f ". - â  +
How the Mementoes of De Long, After
Three Years' Drifting in a Berg,
Were Lost.
Yesterday a Call' representative inter
viewed Henry ' Lund, Consul of Sweden
and Norway in this City* relative to "the
Jeannette relics which were found the lat
ter part of June, 1884, on a drifting Icefloe
near Jullanahope , on the west coast of
Greenland. Mr. '" juund, as a member of the
Geographical Society of the Pacific, Visited
Copenhagan some time ago and consulted
with the Danish Geographical Society re
garding the relics. But they had disap
peared.- r : '-..A
It appears ! that the articles, which con
sisted of pieces of clothing and papers,
were placed in the possession of one of the ,
DR. NANSEN'S PROPOSED ROUTE, FOLLOWING ; THE JEANNETTE'S DRIFT.
j members of the society. He soon after
| died and all his effects passed into the
hands of distant relatives who found the
musty old things saved from : the icefloe."
So the precious relics of one of the most
pathetic stories in the annals of the sea
were sweft out for the ragman and wasted
forever. Even the manner of their disap
pearance was no less pathetic than the
death of the brave men in the snow of the
! Lena delta. *â¢-:â¢
"The members of the Geographical So
ciety at Copenhagen," said Mr.' Lund,
"were chagrined and distressed when they
learned that the Jeannette articles were
lost. They -considered it a. misfortune,
almost a calamity, and made every effort
to trace them. You see I was commis
sioned by our uociety to bring the relics
home, but was obliged to return empty-'
handed. It's ia ; pity to think that those
articles, after surviving a long drift through
the Arctic for three years, should be "care
lessly arid needlessly lost."
As is well known Dr. Nansen, the Nor
| wegian explorer who has just been re
ported as having reached the north pole,
aid his proposed route along the line of
these drifting relics. The Jeannette after
passing through Bering Straits proceeded
almost north till caught in the ice near
Wrangell Island, and for almost two years
she drifted northerly with the floe. â¢ On
June 13, 1881, she was crushed in longi
tude 150 degrees 59 minutes east, from
Greenwich and latitude 77 degrees 16
: minutes north. The floe with the relics
i evidently continued ito drift northward,
i crossing over the region of the pole, thence
i south, thoueh still in almost a straight
; line, to the eastern coast of Greenland.
\ It followed the coast around the southern
j point of Greenland, and was discovered
j near Julianahope. Nansen intended to
| strike this current and drift with the ice
j across the pole to Greenland. <
"I don't believe my exploring country
] man found the pole," said Consul Lund,
; "because if he drifted with the ice to the
i pole there is no probability that he would
I find a * counter > current , that would drift
, him back to the Siberian shore. If he did
find such a current then the theory of : the
straight drift of the relics over the polar
apex of the globe and down the Greenland
coast is shaken. I; think we will learn
later, . however, that the rumor is un
founded and that Dr. Nansen is still hunt-,
ing for the current that will take him
across the p01e.".. .'..,â 
General Greely doubted the existence of
| the Jeannette relics and stated that ho be
i lieved that they had never come from that
! vessel, and consequently he had no faith
! in the theory that; Nansen: was following
i out. Mr. Lund during his vieit..to Copen
hagen verified . beyond all . contradiction
that the articles came from the Jeannette
people after they had abandoned the
crushed steamer. From the substance of a
lecture delivered by* Carl Lytzen, director
of Julianahope,* before the .- Geographical
Society of Copenhagen in 1885, he obtained
a description of ; the relics and the story of
their discovery. ,"y.. '
â  Director Lytzen says that exactly three
years to a day after the Jeannette's destruc
tion three Greenlanders, fishing in the bay
of Julianahope, noticed a raven constantly
hovering over an icefloe, and upon in-
I vestigating tbey found a number of articles
! frozen fast 'in;. the ice. A few days after
another find was reported in the vicinity.
There > were* fifty-eight pieces -of clothing
and other â  articles, of which Mr.' Lytzen
succeeded in securing the following -y

Jeannette, lost June 13, 1881, north ef the
Siberian coast. : ,â¢'-. â¢ : '
9 Director Lytzen continued in his lecture
before the Danish scientists, of which the
following is a translation :
It has long been known that the currents of
the â  Arctic : go - from the i- northern â  shore .'â¢ of
Siberia over against the east coast of Green
land/along this and from Cape Farewell up in
the opposite direction along the southern end
of the west coast of k Greenland. I shall here
oaly put you In mind of >. the floating timber
picked up on the Greenland shore. 1 The Sibe
rian ] origin of .this' driftwood . is well known.
It grows jin the great forests along the Lena
and other rivers bordering on the Arctic. . The
currents bring it around Spitzbergen to our
coast; -â ; '.".'.--â¢>-.,â â¢!â < -'â '-.- â -:â¢ :*.,-â  -..--. . - â 
. ;.- We now know how long it will take for ian
object to drift with the current from near tne
mouth of the River Lena, in Siberia, to .Green
laud. ilt took three ; years for the Jeannette's
Icefloe to make the journey, which is 1650
Danish miles. V--
The Distance : traveled has in reality been
much longer, for we know from the ships that
have made long .drifts fast in the Arctic ice
that Ihe currents take the floes in many curves.
But it has been-proved, that a berg can travel
over that route and will consume about three
years in the trip. It is also known that the
bergs coming from the Siberian coast over the
middle of the Arctic and around the eastern
shore of Greenland Into Baffins - Bay . will not
crumble until they reach the southern end of
Greenland. â¢ .
- Now, ;it will . be seen that whoever tries to
reach the pole from the Siberian Sea will most
likely be locked up in the ice and carried
across the Arctic and around Greenland, tak
ing . several years on the passage; providing
the vessel is strong enough to stand the squeeze
of the floes. .* . . ; :
"This is the reason I discredit Dr. Nan
sen's alleged discovery,"; said Mr. Lund.
"If he passed over the pole in his drift he
will probably turn up on the east Green
land coast, like the other drifting things
cast into the great Siberian current. If he
has not succeeded in proving the Jean-
nette drift theory he may return home by
way of Bering Sea and the - Japanese
coast." â â .-" - "â 'â 
EVERYBODY ASKED TO WATOH.
Some Reasons Why News of Nansen's Dis
r'y, V covery Might Precede Him.
Some of the leading Russians here hold
that, in their judgment/ there is a strong
probability that -Nan sen', has found the
north pole, and is coming back. They can
see no inconsistency in word coming in ad
vance of him also to this effect.
"If the people only understood the
conditions that surround him," said Agent
Grrunwaldt of the Russian Fur Company
yesterday, "they would see nothing strange
in this. From the time that Nansen set
out from the vicinity of the mouth of the
Lena River every native and ; every
wandering Russian was notified to be on
the lookout for him. â  4
; "Word of such an event would be passed
along as rapidly as possible, and thus it
might be that neither "Mrs. Nansen in
Norway nor his agent .in London might
first hear of , bis discovery and return to
ward- home. The Swedish Government
has long since sent out word for everybody
to be on the lookout for Nansen, his ship
and party; and any news concerning them.
"All along the north coast of Siberia,
down to the Sea of Kara, this is known
among the natives. Therefore word might
precede him. â .^o*__^^!^Sr^i â  -.
"Another thing should be observed, arid
that is that the man Kauchnareff. repre
sented as a trader and agent of Nansen,
received his information of Nansen's com
ing off Kolympek. Now*, Kolympsk is an
important "place t between 1000; and : 1500
miles from Irkutsk. It would be a long
time, therefore, before Kauchnareff could
reach Irkutsk. * : ; ,: :' v C â â¢
"One thing that looks singular to me is
the statement, as voiced in one of the dis
patches from London, that â  the news was
sent by letter from Irkutsk ?to Yakutsk
and on to Kirensk, where it was put on the
wires . and , sent by * telegraph. * The ' tele
graph line reaches from St. Peter burg di
rect ,to : Irkutsk, so what would :be the
reason for the carrying over' two towns be-,
yond? 'â â  : )-}i .-.:â -.: : --AjA a- ;- ._.:::
, "Another reason why I have ! had faith
in the Nansen dispatch isthe reliability of
the St. Petersburg journal; publishing it.
I have lived in St. Petersburg a long while,
and know it to be one of the most careful
newspapers in the world.' It has the con
fidence of the peoplo everywhere." â .
â a. Mr. Grunwaldt arrived from Siberia,
where his company has had large conces
sions "â : for , : , several years, ',' a . little ': over a
month ago. He has -visited Irkutsk, and
is familiar with that part of Siberia.

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
What the Anglers, Athletes and
Cyclists Are Doing.
The long spell of fine weather has
vastly improved the roads of the country
for cycling, and several runs will be held
to-morrow to different points of interest.
The abolishing of class B will materially
aid the officers of amateur clubs in keep
ing the amateur flock from straying -away
to golden roads, where professional riders
will henceforth have full sway. It was a
good move in the right direction to seg
eregate the amateur from the quasi-pro
fessional.
The season for the killing of small game
closed yesterday, and sportsmen will now
turn their attention .to trap-shooting,
which sport will be extensively indulged
in this summer.
Oarsmen are training hard for the re
gatta to be held on Lake Merritt next Sat
urday. It promises to be a very successful
affair. i
Angling for steelheads in tide-water is
now a very popular pastime with lovers of
the rod. *
The Olympic Club, anticipating a bright
season for athletic sports, has decidtd to
make vast improvements in its outdoor
grounds.
Coursing, handball, rifle-shooting, foot
ball, etc., are being well patronized.
the WHEELMEN.
Annual 25-Mile Road Race of the
Associated Clubs Next Saturday.
The one event upon which the interest
of all wheelmen is now centered is the
fourth annual 25-mile handicap road race
of the California Associated Cycling Club,
which will be held next Saturday, Wash
ington's birthday, starting at 10 a. m.
The San Leandro triangular course will
be the scene of the race. From a specta
tor's point of view this is the best located
course for road racing in the State. It is
necessary for the riders to encircle the tri
angle three times to complete twenty-five
miles, and it is thus possible to witness the
start, see the riders pass a given point
twice, and then be at the finish. For this
reason the annual 25-mile race has always
attracted large crowds of spectators.
If the present lair weather continues,
the roads will be in splendid condition on
the day of the race. The riders are train
ing over it now every day. and say that
the triangle was never better. Last year
the race had to be postponed two weeks on
account of rain, but the men kept up their
training indoors so that the race was just
as last and interesting as if it had been
run off on the day it is usually held, Feb
ruary 22.
George H. Stratton, chairman of the
road racing and reoords committee of the
associated clubs, says that there will be
more entries and a better prize list for the
race this year than ever before. The first
prize will be a high grade bicycle, and
there is also a club cup to be contested for.
The entries ior the event will close Mon
day, February 17, and must be in the
hands of Mr. Stratton on that day or they
will not be accepted. . The handicapping
will be done by 11. A. Smyth, the most
crticient and conscientious handicapper on
the coast.
Lieutenant Caldwell, in the absence of
Captain Plummer, who is in Oregon, has
called a run of the Bay City Wneelmen
for to-morrow to Haywards. It is the first
run of the club this year, and a large
crowd is expected. Even such slow but
sure riders as Wetmore, Marshal, How
ard, Judj^e Dunne, Waiters, Ready, Rhys,
, Bent and Toepke have agreed to go along,
as the ride will be easy and they can get
back without taking the train. The run
will leave on the ft o'clock creek-route
boat.
JJJAn exchange says that the rational gar
ment to-be adopted largely \>y. wheel
women the coming season will consist of a
skirt to the knees, bloomers and
leggings. Inasmuch as there is a
strong disinclination on the part of
women to wear a garment that is
so conspicuous as the bloomer, they have
settled on the short skirt as the proper
wheel costume.
Captain Luce has called a run of the Jr.
O. L. A. M. Cyclers for to-morrow to
lr.gleside. The members will assemble at
the Baker-street entrance to the park at
10 a. m., and a large turnout is expected.
A bill is now before the Legislature of
New York State, which provides for a law
compelling railroad corporations to carry
bicycles free as a part of a traveler's bag
gage. It is a step in the right direction,
as the railroads should not impose an
item of expense on a wheelman with a 25
--pound bicycle, when other travelers are
privileged to carry 100 pounds, the form
not being specified.
John S. Egan and J. P. Jaegling form one
of the fastest tandem teams in the Impe
rial Cycling Club, and that is saying con
siderable, for there are now eleven tandems
owned in the club. They are often seen
on the road or in the park on a red wheel,
and dressed in gray suits with red sweaters.
For ordinary riding the handle-bars of
your machine should be kept as nearly as
possible on a level with the saddle. This
insures an easy, comfortable seat and an
appropriate position, but, of course, is not
meant to meet the requirements of
racing men. When the pedal is at the
lowest point, no matter whether the rider !
may be stooping over or sitting up straight, I
the" ball of the foot should rest on it easily. \
This insures the proper ankle motion, !
saves unnecessary exertion and fatigue.
The members of the San Francisco Road
Clud will ride to San Leandro to-morrow
and speed round the triangle. After lunch
they will ride to Lake Chabot. Members
will assemble at the clubhouse at 8:30 a. m.
M. A. Farnsworth, a crack rider from
Denver, has joined this club, as he expects
to permanently reside here.
The action of the National Assembly of
the League of American Wheelmen at
Baltimore this past week in abolishing
class B entirely, and declaring two classes
only, pure amateurs and professionals, is
such a startling and radical change that
the racing men here are all at seaâ they
don't know which way to turn. The rules
will now be the same as they were two j
years ago, but the amateur line will be !
drawn tighter. than ever and the league j
hopes by supporting and keeping a careful
eye on professional racing to make it
popular with the public. It remains to be j
.seen what the result will be. The record
breaking teams at Santa Monica and
Coronado will have to disband probably,
as they are all class B men, and though I
they are given the privilege of going back
into pure amateurism, or what was known ''
as class A, they cannot then accept em- j
ployment from, bicycle companies or ex
pense money or remuneration of any !
kind. J j
The record table is also sadly affected. !
All those beautiful class B records, made
in competition against time, flying and !
standing start, paced and unpaced, on all j
sizes of tracks and under various condi- I
tions, will be dropped.
If the League of- American Wheelmen
can satisfactorily control professional
racing, and it will probably find the way
to do so, it is more than likely that most |
of the 537 class B men in the United States '
will go into the professional ranks and
race for cash prizes. Those who have
made a living out of the sport under the !
old class B rules will have to do so or seek j
some other employment, as nothing of the I
kind will be permitted in new amateurism.
The Liberty Cycling Club will ride to j
Centerville to-morrow, taking the ft a. m.
broad-gauge boat. Frank Kelly, William |
Rohrer, J. Holle, H. Goertzhain, George j
Thackeray and R. P. Waite have been i
sleeted to membership recently. The club
will hold its fourth social hop in April.
N. A. Robinson has charge of the arrange
ments for the club's relay team, and seve
! ral of the club's road riders are now train-
I ing for this event and the twenty-five-mile
race next Saturday.
The Olympic Cyclers to the number of
about thirty left for Fresno yesterday
| afternoon in a special car and will produce
a minstrel entertainment to-night at the
Barton Opera-house there for the benefit
:of the Fresno Athletic Club: The show is
about the same as was recently produced
here at the Columbia Theater on the occa
sion of the thirty-sixth anniversary of the
Olympic Club. The cyclers will wear their
white caps and bicycle uniforms and take
along their wheels. To-morrow they will
have a run with the Fresno Athletic Club
Wheelmen. Among those who will take

The writer just returned from Fresno
last night. The members of the athletic
club there are making great preparations
to receive the minstrels,. and will meet
them at the station with a brass band and
S J. S. Egan and J. P. Jaegling. the Fast Tandem Team of the Imperial Cycling Clnb.
form into a procession, which will include
the fire companies and infantry. The
visitors will be driven about the in car
riages city to see the sights. . President
Harry Sherwood and Director R. M.
Thompson of the Fresno club deserve a
great deal of credit for the energy they
have displayed in getting up this entertain
ment and bringing the players down
there. AH the seats in tbe opera-nouse
have been sold, and with the proceeds of
the entertainment it is intended to further
fit up the clubhouse and possibly spend
some of the money on outdoor grounds.
Tne cycling annex of the club contains
about thirty-five members. They are all
strong, active riders and enjoy many spins
into the surrounding country. A favorite
trip is to Mendota, not far away, and there
are many other places to visit. The roads
in midsummer are thick with dust, but
this does not deter them from riding.
They say the good roads bureau ought to
come down there once and they would see
roads so bad they could hardly believe
their eyes. R. M. Thompson, local consul
of the league in Fresno, a very courteous
gentleman, is trying to get all the mem
bers to join that organization and thus
help the good roads work considerably in
that section.'
The Alameda. Cyclers, a flourishing
club, owe a great deal of their success
to the activity and energy of President J.
F. Ives and Captain V. A. Dodd. The
club now numbers ninety-three members.
The clubrooms have recently been en
larged, repainted and newly* furnished,
and with the addition of pool and billiard
tables are as finely appointed as those
of any bicycle club in the State. The visit
of the League of American Wheelmen's
recruiting committee a week ago did con
siderable eood, as over half the member
ship will join the organization. As league
clubs receive sanctions for race meets free,
while others must pay $25 lor the same
privilege, it is likely that three-fourths of
the club will join so as to make it a league
club, as the Alameda Cyclers have half
control of the proposed new Alameda race
track, but could give no , race meets on it
without a sanction of the L. A. W. These
remarks also apply to the Olympic Club
Wheelmen, whose representatives are in
terested in the other half of the proposi
tion.
Captain A. G. Maass has called a run of
the Golden Gate Cycling Club to Center
ville for ' to-morrow, leaving on the 5
o'clock broad-gauge boat. This club is
enjoying quite a boom in membership at
present, and will be a strong factor among
the organized clubs this season. The
members will adopt a new uniform
shortly. Several of the club's fast road
riders will enter the 25-mile roadrace next
Saturday, and it would be no surprise to
see the club's emblem up in front at the
finish.
That the Alameda track will be a big
success is beyond question. The manage
ment is in good hands, and if it now re
ceives proper support financially from the
dealers of this City, who by good rights
should pay for it entirely, it will soon be
a reality and a joy forever. The Bay City
Wheelmen and the North California Divi
sion, L. A. W., through the influence of
Judge Kerrigan, will .subscribe to the
stock generously,* and such support means
a good deal.
A copy of the Barnes catalogue is just to
hand. It is a work of art of thirty-two in
teresting . pages, and is well worth the
sending for and perusai.
A meeting of the San Francisco Bicycle
Track Association will be held this even
ing at the rooms of the Bay City Wheel
men. The session will *be "short, as it is
proposed to disorganize after * turning over
all the assets of the association to the pro
moters of the Alameda track and grounds.
. Harry F. Terrill, the well-known racer
of this City, will return home from his
protracted Eastern trip - to-day or to
morrow. He wrote from Chicago on
February 8 that he was being royally
entertained there by Julian Pye Bliss,
George K. Barrett and the Chicago
Cycling Club. â¢- '
Entries for the indoor tournament were
to have closed on February 24, but owing
to the change in the racing rules doing
away with classes A and B the programme
will all. have to be changed- which will be
done at once. Amateur and professional
races will be provided for and the riders
can take their choice. | Most of the local
men will, no doubt, remain in the amateur
class. .' , AJA'y.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen are a very
lively body of cyclists just at present. The
change in officers seems to have had a
beneficial and stimulating effect. Seventy
eight members and -twelve, visitors at
tended the last regular meeting. '. Captain
Fawcett is arranging a series of runs for
the spring and summer months, which
will be very enjoyable. . ; Spalding.

The following interesting article concern
ing tiger-shooting in India appeared in the-
Field of London and will give sportsmen
; who are looking for big game an idea of
; what they may expect should a trip to In
dia be in contemplation :
Since our introduction to the native hunters
of India, says the correspondent, our plan of
hunting is to go into a district where tigers
are reported to be and tie up baits in the
; neighborhood of the ravine where the beast is
supposed to lie up in the daytime.- On getting
a kill the hunters drive out the ravine, work- i
ing up hill, and bolt the tiger if he is in a hold
ing place which has a back exit. In many
cases, however, he is in a blind alley, and then,
while they face him with torches and spenrs,
we kill him with ihe Express rifle, and gener
ally at a distance of some ten yards.
The tiger in most instances retreats before
- â - *Â*,-'e
the torches used; and fire, coupled with tha
presence of half a dozen determined men, seem
to cow him utterly; but not always so, and on
one or two occasions the risk has been consid
erable in consequence of a charge kndcking
out the lights. While working with us our
men have been unarmed, and no tiger has
touched them, but one can fancy the terrible
damage that would be done did the beast get
among them, which he certainly would do aid
they lose their nerve or presence of mind.
They are, however, fully alive to this fact, and
acknowledge that their only safety is in boldly
facing him. â  Ââ  â ;y~.. t â. v y:,y-yy
An accident happened a few days ago to the
head man, who is now laid up in the hospital.
Unfortunately We were not present on this
occasion; but had we been, we could scarcely
have done more than kill the beast as he was
escaping. It appears that having tracked a
tiger to a ravine, the men determined to block
him in pending our arrival. They lit their
torches, and were at the entrance of the rocks
when he charged out among them, and bit one
unfortunate through the leg, besides inflicting
numerous claw wounds. How the others
escaped is a mystery; but he simply seemed to'
give this one man a reminder in passing, and
then continued his course over the country.
We believe that had the men been only a lew
feet within the line of rocks, they would have
beaten or frightened him back.
One of our party had a narrow escape some
time ago, as, in following up a tigress, he first
became aware of her presence by seeing her
crouched on a ledge of rock some ten yards off
on his left, a projecting bowlder preventing
her being seen until his eye*; met hers. He no
sooner attempted to bring his Express to bear
than with a roar she sprang for his bead, and
would infallibly have fetched it had he not
jumped back quickly, while, as she came at
right angles, she had to turn, which allowed
two Express bullets to be fired into her by the
explorer and a friend who was behind him.- In
her rush she knocked out the torches,
which were held as usual on long bamboos;
and came with full weight against
the hunters' spears, who manfully opposed
her. She made one or two more determined
rushes, and it was only the seventh bullet, in
the eye, which killed her. On skinning she
was full of wounds, as may be imagined; one
shot being in the typically exact position be
hind the shoulder. This beast was doubtless
one of those of uncommon vitality and fierce
ness, and the experience shows that at a pinch
a shot from a .577 Express is by no means the
absolutely certain stopper one could wish.
It will no doubt surprise many an Indian
sportsman who.may read this to know that in
the places where he almost infallibly loses a
tiger we should almost as surely bag him. Our
men, however, will not face covert, but de
pend on the animal homing in a rocky ravine,
where they deal with him satisfactorily.
A good . many natives have been killed by
tigers in this country during the past two
years. Several fatalities are attributed to one
particular beast who rejoices in a deformed
foot, and whom we have been after many a
time without success. ...
At dusk the doors of the village houses are
all closed, and few natives appear before day
break, as the tigers in these parts seem to de
pend upon domestic animals for food, and
haunt the villages at night to secure such. We
have been some distance in the country, but
can find no game in sufficient quantities, to
feed the many tigers that are about. Foxes,
badgers and a few wild pigs there are, but the
cultivation and dearborization are carried on to
such an extent as to preclude their increasing.
These tigers, therefore, live almost entirely on
goats, pigs, dogs and cattle, with an occasional
human being. In one part of the country we
lately visited there was hardly a dog left, "they
having all iallen victims. Missing the yelping
of the curs in going through the villages was a
pleasing oddity.

TROUTING. â¢'.
Most any sort of a day will do
For ordinary outing,
So long as the skies above are olue;
So long as there is sport in view;
But who can tell 'forehandâ you?
The proper day for trouting?
The wind may blow just as you wish,
The day be most propitious, -
But still you fall, and Tom cries '.'Pish Iâ
I told you soâ an empty dish."
And yon may take an angler's course
In trouting and in piking, :-.â¢"' . f
And trace the science to its source Â»
And talk until your throat is hoarse,
But never yet was man could force
A fish against his liking.
Yet, of en to our great surprise,
in most unlikely weather, ;
When we have tried bait and files
iOf every make and every size,
His troutship condescends to rise '
And feast on fur and feather. ... y
For hours we've paddled round about
To find our prey capricious,
Until we're almost tired out; '.A-A'AA':-
When lo: we hook a monster trout!
And land him with exultant shout â â 
Oh ! ibis Is joy delicious.
Such moments force us to forget
When heart and brain grow mated
With life's monotony and fret;
And though we spin our â  yarnsâ you bet â 
I never knew an angler yet
That was not to be trusted. â¢ '"a, :. :â ' i A AA ';

Recent intelligence from Duncans Mills
states that the Russian Rive* is tolerably
low and : very clear,- and tnat , angling for
steelheads is now in order. John Butler
and Dr. yon Hoffman will leave this City
to-day for a few days' angling on the river,
and as both gentlemen â¢ are veterans in
winter fishing their many friends in this
City will expect to see them return on
Monday evening with a number of beauti
ful fish. â ;â  'â¢'..; ' Â_â¢ _
The steelhead caught in the tidewater of
Russian River is as- game ; a fish as any
angler ever stuck hook i; in to,' and experi
ence has proven to many an old warrior at
the game that to successfully handle a fresh
run female from old ocean, strong tackle
is decidedly necessary in the first place,
and in the second place ; : the mar. at the
butt of a rod must understand his busi
ness thoroughly or otherwise Ihe will rind

that his quarry has left him- sadly j in the
lurch: by a sudden dash for a log around
which it twines the leader. '"' â¢*.
The secret of success in preventing a
large fish from snagging your line is to
keep as close to it as you can. If angling
from the bank of a river or stream, follow
your fish as quickly as possible and put a
tight strain on it should a dash for any
obstruction be its object in view. Never
stand and allow your line to escape from
the reel when a" fish is heading for any
sunken matter. Hold tight, and if your
tackle is sound the fish will change his
course and dash down stream. Of course,
many little pointers, so called, can be
given to new beginners, but to thoroughly
understand how to handle a fish, ex
perience is the only educator.
The sporting editor of The Call was
among* the many favored ones who re
ceived one of the many beautiful salmon
that were shipped by Mr. Chase of Santa
Cruz to Henfy Skinner of E. T. Allen &
Co. a few days ago. The Santa Cruz
salmon is highly prized by epicures be
cause of its rich flavor.
The residents of Point Rey es were sur
prised last Sunday at seeing such a large
number of anglers" leave the train on its
arrival from this City; but their, surprise
was ail the more great when they saw the
army return from the fishing-grounds
minus a scale. Possibly the -sport may be
better to-morrow; it can't certainly be
worse than it was a week ago. Some fish
of small size were caught during the past
week. * ' *
The following letter to The Call is self
explanatory :
To the Sporting Editor of the San Francisco
Callâ Dear Sir: If a Fish Commissioner or a
deputy would stroll around in the neighbor
hood of the Fish ranch, San Pablo Creek, any
Sunday be would find the creek lined with
fishermen. Yours respectfully, Sportsman.
It is reported that the Fish Commission
ers, at a recent meeting, acting upon the
suggestion of The Call, appointed a dep
uty to patrol the coast streams until April
1. If this report iis true the local anglers
will appreciate, the good intention of the
commission in their behalf. 'â â â¢' , -
Mr. Bertrand of Tocaloma sends the fol
lowing letter for publication in the sport
ing department of The Call, in answer to
a statement which recently appeared re
garding the killing of steelheads in Paper
mill Creek by. people who do not respect
the law. The letter speaks for itself :
Sporting Editor of the Call: In The Call
of February 8 is published an article in which
the asseitiou is made of the wholesale slaugh
ter of steelheads by nefarious fishermen with
spears and gaffs on Paper-mill Creek, between
Tocaloma and Camp Taylor. This oft-repeated
tale goes the rounds of the daily press year
alter year just before the fishing season opens.
Whether this is the spite work of some unscru
pulous persons or that there is the real want
for the proper vigilance on the part of the Fish
Commissioners, it reflects but little credit
upon those sportsmen who were, as claimed,
witnesses to this system of fishing "without
making any advances to have the offenders
â  punished by due process of law, as would have
been the course of every true fisherman who
upholds the dignities and rights of sportsmen,
instead of spreading the intelligence after the
acts were committed.
As a resident of Tocaloma and one who is in
a position to. throw some light as to what is
going on in this vicinity by reason of my daily
trips, to and from Camp Taylor I can state for
the interests of sportsmen generally that I
have not as yet seen any of this wholesale
slaughter going on, and even if it were so
where could the eleven or twelve fihermen
have come from when there are but four resi
dents between the points designated? That
such outrages could have' been tolerated in
this vicinity after 1 have gone to the trouble of
planting over 100,000 trout in the Paper-mill
Creek at Camp Taylor can only be vindicated
by the parties producing the evidence for the
prosecution of the law-breakers. As a further
guarantee to justify the falsity of the forego
ing assertion any Fish Commissioner is at
liberty to stay at the Bertrand Hotel for two
weeks any time between npw and the Ist of
April in order to assure the Commissioners as
well as sportsmen whether the residents of this
community require a deputy tagging after
their heels to enforce the fish law.
â¢>:.. Joseph F. Bertrand.
Tocaloma, Cal., Feb. 10, 1896. .
It is to be presumed that the proprietors
of summer resorts near a stream which is
extensively whipped by anglers during
the open season for trout fishing will take
sufficient interest in the protection of
breeding fishes to cause the arrest of per
sons seen in the act of killing large fish
above* tidewater. Statistics show that by
the killing of a large female steelhead on
a spawning bed, the .loss of.fry to the
stream from which the fish "is . taken
amounts to something like 400. It can
therefore be very easily seen that a grand
creek for trout-fishing purposes may be
quickly destroyed of all interest, to anglers
by depopulating it of the breeding fishes
during the months of the year when ang
ling is prohibited by law. There have
been steelheads killed" in the Paper-mill
Creek above tide water this year, and on
Sunday last five large fishes were speared
in the Lagunitas Creek which is one of the
feeders of the Paper-mill.
It is by no means to be supposed that
Mr. Bertrand can see all that may be going
on in the stream in question, yet there is
no doubt but that he has an eye out for
poachers, and would report to the Fish
Commissioners any infringement of the
law that may come under his observation.
Regardless, however, of the close watch
that Mr. Bertrand may keep on the Stream,
the anglers of this "City, and they are
many, would be pleased to learn that the
Fish Commissioners had detailed one of
their deputies to patrol Paper-mill and
Lagunitas creeks in Marin County and the
Sonoma Creek in Sonoma County, as those'
are the principal streams which arc visited
by the local fraternity during the early
months of the angling season. ~ .Â».
The managers of the San Francisco and
North Pacific Coast Railroad, having an
eye to business, refuse to ship any fish
taken from the streams near which their i
trains pass during the closed season for
angling. -The anglers will appreciate this
action on the part of the railroad officials
by patronizing their line when thOan'glihjz
season opens. If the fishermen who"ship j
steelheads from Duncans Mills over the I
North Pacific Coast Railway were treated I
in a' like manner there would be little
need for a fish patroi on that part of the
river. Since Deputy Wilson made a cap
ture or two nets at the mouth of the Rus- I
sian River two weeks ago some boxes of
steelheads were shipped by Wells, Fargo
& Co. from Duncans Mills. This proves
that there are yet a few nets remaining
near the mouth of the river which need
overhauling.

Crews That Will Contest In the Re
gatta of Next Saturday.
The regatta which will be held on . the
22d inst. on Lake Merritt is the all-absorb
ing topic of conversation at the present
time in aquatic circles. 'â '.'
The ; clubs that have announced their
willingness to participate in the contests
are the Dolphins, Ariels, South Ends, Uni
versity, Columbia, Alameda and Pioneer
boat clubs. â Â,-.â . ...
The programme of the race*?, it is thought,
will have to be changed. The celebration
committee has reduced the regatta funds,
and tins' will necessitate eliminating the
junior baree races. S. J. Pembroke, who
has the affair in hand, intends to over
come this difficulty by making a collection
from the railroad companies whose lines
are in the immediate vicinity of the lake. ;
' .The races will start promptly at :2i
o clock. Charles G. Yale of Oakland will j
act as referee, and the judges will be Eu
gene Flanders of the Ariel Boat Club, John
T. Sullivan of the Pioneer Club, and Dr.
Cecil Dennis of the Alameda Club.
The course of the races has been care
fully laid out, and is satisfactory in every
way excepting at the stakeboat, where the
water is shallow, which will not admit of
pivot-turning. __ \., \
* To: insure the oarsmen keeping in deep
water stakes will be driven on both sides
of the course the entire length.
The management wishes to state that,
owing to the ' low tide in the estuary, the
boat clubs should get their boats over early
in the morning of the regatta, or -provision
will be made to house boats over night at
the Alameda or University boathouses.
It also states that the -clinging costume
usually worn by the oarsmen will not be
tolerated in this regatta:- â 
The Alameda Boat Club intends to enter
a barge crew and the following outrigger
skiff oarsmen in the races: I Captain Jack
Ââ 'â .â -'.â  .*â '.'-â ' â '''*-' â  -â  â 
Lancaster of the yacht Edna, James Pem
broke and Fred Ayers.
Captain W. O. Patch of the Dolphin
Club will not enter any crews, but J.
Coughlin will represent the club in the
outrigger events. '
Frank Duplissea and William McCaus
land of the South End Club, and probably
Samuel J. Pembroke of the Alameda Club
and Henry Whitkopf of the Ariel Club,
will row in the senior single-scull event.
This race should be worth going to see, as
each holds a championship.
Speculation is rife as to the probable
â¢winner of the University-Columbia four
oared race. Both crews- are training as
siduously and a close contest is assured.
It was confidently expected that the
Pioneer senior crew would match oars
with the South End's crew in this regatta,
but their intentions of entering it have not
as yet materialized.
The Ariel Club held an impromptu con
cert at the boathouse . last Sunday and an
enjoyable afternoon was spent in dancing,
singing and listening to musical selections.
Henry Bode of the South End senior
crew tried out the new Olympic Club crew
last Sunday. They were H. Grimm, Harry
Morse, Jules Morton and A. Aliisson.
The Olympic Club is having a racing
shell built by Al Rodgers, the raceboat
builder. It will be 43 feet long, 22 inches
beam, 8 inches deep, and will have a seat
for a coxswain. - v - -,
At a meeting of the Dolphin Club, held
last evening, the treasurer announced that
the club did not owe a dollar, but had a
deficit in the treasury. Thomas Hopkins
was elected to membership, and Charlie
Mitchell, W. Fouyer ' and Sam Murray
were proposed.
W. 0. Patch, the club's captain, has a
junior crew organized. They are: Joe
jaib, afterwaist; Fred Woerner, forward
waist; Ed Sullivan, stroke, and W. O.
Patch, bow and captain.
The club will hold its annual picnic

AFTER THE RESTAURANTS
Inspector Ben Davis Commences
a Crusade Against
Filth.
TOUR OF CLAY STREET MADE.
The Cheapest Places Were Discovered
to Be in Need of a General
Cleaning Up.
Ben Davis, the man to whom, as chief
market inspector and special policeman,
the City's Health Department has given
the work of finding out the sellers of unfit
meats, and one of whose duties is to visit
the culinary ends of restaurants and in
vestigate as to cleanliness and sanitation,
made a tour of a number of eating places
yesterday and shook things up a little.
As Mr. Davis explained, it is the begin
ning of a crusade against such places of re
freshment as do not observe the natural
laws of health.
The first day's work in this direction was
not bad. He visited about a score of places
and waded through kitchens and groped
around in cellars. Whenever he ran up
against a bad smell he usually traced it to
its source and ordered the proprietor to
have the cause either removed or reme
died forthwith. He gave the' proprietor
the choice of either doing so or having his
place then and there condemned and
Closed up. As a general rule the sugges
tions made by Mr. Davis were complied
with. . .â  'y'-y*
Mr. Davis thought he would begin by
taking a look at the cheap eating-houses
on Clay street in the 600 block. These are
all either 5-cent or 10-cent places where
the poor of the City's floating population
can be found at any hour of the dajt until
late at night dividing their choice between
either coffee and doughnuts or a big plate
of stew with its incidental accompani
ments of soup, bread, potatoes and tea,
coffee, milk or doubtful wine.
* These cheap restaurants were not such
as Mr. Davis might 'have desired, but as
one man remarked he had been in the
business -for ten years and such a thing as
an official inspection of places where peo
ple get their food was a novelty to him.
Usually the "cheap joints," as the vul
var call them, were not clean. The cus- i
tom is to have them swept up once or twice
a day and occasionally scrubbed, but it is
no easy matter to keep them scrupulously
clean. A proprietor of one place said he
fed 1300 people every day. From 800 to
1000 is the usual percentage for a day of
any of tnem. ; yy! y, -
A Call representative made a tour of
some of the restaurants later in the day
and found that where the inspector had
ordered a general cleaning up it nad been j
done. The same was done with the swill bar
rels. These receptacles for the inevitable I
slops had either been removed to more
suitable locations or changed as desired.
; Mr. Davis insists upon such receptacles be
ing of galvanized iron, covered and out of
the way. a y. y r
In one place he found a dishwasher with
a sore hand, and on the advice of Mr.
Davis the man was made to take his
apron and give place to a stalwart fellow
who did not manifest any taint of blood.
The better class of restaurants on Mont
gomery street and in the 500 block on
Ciay street, where a meal can be had- for
25 cents, were found satisfactory in condi
tion and their sanity equipments were pro
nounced good by Mr. Davis. He had noth
ing but praise for the lunchrooms which
he went through on Pine Btreet, between
Sansome and Battery.
Henry Sass was loud in his praise of
the new move by the health authorities,
and said he for one would co-operate with
them every time and all tne time.
In most parts of Europe It is considered
unlucky for a hare to cross the road in
front of a traveler. Among the Romans
this omen was so unfortunate that ii a
man starting upon a journey espied a hare
on the road before him he would return
and wait until the following day to com
mence his journey. V

Gladness Comes
\X7ith a better understanding of the
8 v v transient nature of the many phys-
ical ills which vanish before proper ef-
fortsâgentle effortsâ pleasant effortsâ
rightly directed. There is comfort in
the knowledge that so many forms of
sickness are not due to any actual dis-
ease, but simply to a constipated condi-
tion of the system, which the pleasant
family laxative, Syrup of Figs, prompt-
ly removes. That is why it is the only
remedy with millions of families, and is
everywhere esteemed' so highly by all
who value good health. Its beneficial
effects are due to the fact, that it is the
one remedy which promotes internal
cleanliness, without debilitating the
organs on which it acts. *It is therefore
all important, in order to get its bene-
ficial effects, |to note when you pur-
chase, that you have the genuine article,
which is manufactured by the California
Fig Syrup Co. only, and sold by all rep-'
utable druggists.
: If in the enjoyment of good health,
and the system is regular, then laxa-
tives or other remedies are not needed.
If afflicted with any actual disease; one
may be commended to the most skillful
physicians, but if in need, of a laxative,
then one should have the best, and with
, the well-informed everywhere, Syrup of '
Figs stands highest and is most largely
used and gives most general satisfaction.

San Francisco, room 74, Nevada block,
says: l 'l obtained a bottle of Munyon's
Rheumatism Cure, intending to ascertain
its effects upon a sort of. rheumatic gout* in
j my left foot, from which I had suffered a
I great deal. After taking several doses of
j the pellets the pain left my foot and
j located in the joint of mv ri_ht wrist. The
j pain was intense, but in the meantime the
j swelling in my foot' had almost entirely
I disappeared. "Three days later my wrist
! commenced to improve to such an extent
| ttat I was able to handle a pen, and at
E resent lam entirely free from pain. My
t oot, which I had cut in order to afford
i me relief, I have laid aside for an ordinary
â¢gaiter, and inasmuch as I took no other
i medicine I must attribute the cure to your

The Australian Gate Sent Three
of the Fields Away in
Fine Order.
THREE FAVORITES IN FRONT.
Uncertainty Surprised the Crowd by
Romping Away From His Field
at Odds of 40 to i.
The Australian starting machine has
come to stay. It was tried again yester
day with marked success on tnree diffei
. ent occasions, the fields being dispatched
in fine order without noticeable delay. Its
speedy adoption by the California Jockey
Club, whose officers have seen it in opera
tion at the new course, is an evidence of
its growing popularity.
The attendance at the track far exceeded
that of the other days of the week with
the exception of ladies' day. This can be
accounted for in the noticeable falling off
in the crowds that formerly filled the
downtown gambling dens, many of whom
have become tired of being "buncoed"
out of their money by false information
and now visit the track. The card was a
good one and the racing all that could be
desired.
The day's sport was enlivened by the
win of Uncertainty, who startled the
crowd by galloping away with the third
event on the card at the very long odds of
40 to 1. I-avontes headed their fields to
the wire on three different occasions.
Senator Bland, Little Jimmie and Mir
amoo were the ones principally backed to
win the opening seven-furlong run, the
: n '-named horse going to the post a 7 to
. 5 favorite. Little Jimmie, who opened a
b to 5 choice, was second choice when the
horsw were called. The three horses
named had the race to themselves, finish
ing half lengths apart on the wire, just as
they were played in the betting, Senator 1

TIERNEY'S DEATH.
Ho Escaped From a Hospital Ward
Because No Guard Was
Provided.
Thomas Tierney, formerly a City Hail
politician, died at the City and County
Hospital Monday last under circumstances
that will probably -lead to a demand for an
increased appropriation for that institu
tion.
Tierney was sent to the County Jail for
several months, after having been con
victed of a misdemeanor, and remained
there until the second inst., when he de
veloped symptoms of pulmonary trouble,
and was transferred to the hospital. As
Tierney became delirious, the superin
tendent, having no one to act as guard,
ordered him strapped to his cot.
He succeeded in breaking away and
escaping. Five days later he was found
wandering about the grounds in a filthy
condition, and stated that he had been
under the hospital in a place reserved for
a colony of rabbits. The exposure had
placed his case beyond hope of recovery
and he died on Monday.
Superintendent Stahle says that* it was
Sheriff Whelan's place to guard the man,
as he was really a prisoner, and that the
Sheriff is to blame. Dr. Stahle will prob
ably ask for guards to care for such cases.
A VALENTINE LUNCHEON
Mrs. Darling Entertains Twelve
Ladies in Honor of Mrs.
Niebaum.
The Friday Night Dancing Class
Finishes the Season in a Blaze
â â - of Glory.
Mrs. Darling, who enjoys the reputation '
of being quite the most gracious and tact
ful of the San Francisco hostesses, gave a
luncheon yesterday afternoon at her town
residence, corner of Sutter and Gough
streets, adding thereby another success to
her already long list of social triumphs.
Mrs. Niebaum, wife of the ex-Consul to
Russia, was the guest of honor.
The table decorations were all in red, the
artillery color, and all the table accesso
ries, as far as .good taste would permit,
were of a corresponding shade.
In the center of the table was a graceful
basket filled to overflowing with scarlet
carnations and edged with delicate maiden
hair. From the center to the four ends of
the long table were stretched ropes of car
nations and srailax, the ends falling in
graceful loops almost to the floor. There
were red bonbons in the silver bonbon
nieres, natural fruit juices stained the ice
cream a deep red, and red-shaded candles
shed a soft light over the handsome table.
Yesterday being St. Valentine's day the
pretty time-honored sentiment was appro
priately observed in a most delightful way.
At the plate of each guest in lieu of tho
usual name card was a dainty valentine â
a valentine with appropriate sentiments,
surrounded for the most part by the em
blems of the day â Cupids, hearts, arrows
and wreaths of roses delicately exe
cuted in water colors by Miss Catherwood,
each bearing the stamp mark of the place
most dear to the heart of the one it was
addressed to.
Mrs. Tubbs' valentine was stamped Bos
ton; Mrs. H. L. Dodge's token came from
the green hills of Vermont; .for Mrs. Blair
there was a message from New York the
Baroness yon Schroeder's came from Ham
burg; Washington sent a tender ureeting
to Mrs. Holt; Mrs. J. D. Fry's valentine
was posted in New York; Mrs. Charles
Slack's valentine was posted in San Fran
cisco; Mrs. Niebaum's came from far off
Russia; Mrs. Lloyd Tevis' was stamped
Louisville, Ky.; from her beloved Paris
came a message to Mrs. Coit; Mrs. Wil
liam Alvord's valentine came from New
York; from Philadelphia came a message
for Mrs. W. Dean; Mrs. Jewett received
her tender token from Sonoma County,
and Napa County sent Mrs. Darling the
compliments of the day. Luncheon was
served at 1 o'clock, covers being laid for
fourteen.
The Friday Night Dancing Class met for
the last time this season last evening at
Lunt's Hall. Early in the winter Mesdames
Blanding, Salisbury and Pierce organized
this club, the object being to provide
amusement for those not yet "out."
The hours were early. Dancing began
at S o'clock sharp, and' at eleven the last
guest had departed. The success of the
Friday Night Class was immediate. After
the second dance the list was closed. For
its final dance the club waived its usual
simplicity. The hours were prolonged
until after 1 a. m., and an elaborate supper
was substituted for the lemonade and weak
claret punch, known as the "light refresh
ments." There were calcium lights, the
Hungarian Band and favors. Previous
training made the guests punctual, and at
3:30 nearly all the guests had arrived.
Dancing was immediately inaugurated and
continued until 11:30, when supper was
served.
After suppor the cotillon was danced.
It being leap year a ladyâ Miss Hobartâ
led, assisted by Dr. Harry Tevis. Five
figures were danced and the favors for the
gentlemen were sticks of chewing gum
and toy balloons; for the ladies exquisite
paper flowers which came from New York
and stuffed brownies.
In the first set were: Miss Hobart, Miss
Salisbury, Miss Pierce, Miss . Blanding,
Miss Hannah Williams, Miss Borell, Miss
Maraquita Collier, Miss Jessie Hobart,
Miss Mary McNutt, Robert Eyre, Dr.
Tevis, Ray Sherman. Mr. Rathbohe, Mack
Robbins, Max McNutt,- Walter Hobart.
A fashionable tea for this afternoon will
be one given by the Mercantile Library
Auxiliary, from 3 to 5 o'clock in the rooms
of their elegant building. As so many
prominent society ladies are interested in
the library and its auxiliary the rooms
will evidently be crowded during the aft
ernoon.
Upon the reception committee are: Mrs.
Lovell White, Mrs. W. F. Herrin, Mrs.
Henry Gibbons, Mrs. Fanny Lent, Mrs.
Demas C. Babin. Mrs. Isidore Burns, Miss

SPECIAL CONTRACT BURDENS.
Jurors Called Into Court Concerning
the Indictment of Peter F.
Lane.
The Grind Jury yesterday, responded to
a subpena to appear before Judge Belcher,
Department 11, Superior Court, and an
swer questions concerning the indictment
of Peter F. Lane. * _--â¢â -_.:
Carroll Cook, counsel for Lane, pro
pounded to each juror the following ques
tions: ; - r i',"'.'l _ '.:V ''* '.-â  â  ' \ â 
"Did you take part in finding the indict
ments against Peter F. Lane?"
"Had you before that matter was brought
before the Grand Jury formed any opinion
on the subject?"
"Had you read about the case or heard
anything relative to the defendant?"
Grand Juror John F. Cline acknowledged
that he had read about the case and formed
a partial opinion that Lane was guilty.
Replying to questions addressed to him
by District Attorney. Barnes, Mr. . Cline
said: "The opinion was formed generally,
and not on this particular case. I did not
discuss the case outside of the jury-room."
Carroll Cook asked the witness this ques
tion :
"Can you declare under oath that your
opinion as a grand juror was not influ
enced by the newspaper reports which you
read?"
The witness replied affirmatively.
Other jurors testified that they had
formed no opinion whatever before the
matter was brought to the Grand Jury.
C. F. Curry, County Clerk, was the only
witness called by the Grand Jury. at the
regular session, yesterday afternoon, al
though frequent conferences were held
with District Attorney Barnes. yy;
Mr. Curry was in the jury-room fully a
half-hour. He was asked all sorts of que s
tions concerning his management of the
County Clerk's office, and particular ques
tions relating to Morris' collection of fees
for notarial certificates.
Mr. Curry could not state the amount of
money which Morris collected, or whether
all that was collected had been turned in.
The opinion was expressed by members of
the Grand Jury that Morns' collections in
the aggregate did not constitute a large
sum. . . . i'; .-,;. â >â 
Among the witnesses in waiting yester
day were Dr. Pescia and John Fey. Some
weeks ago the latter was assaulted by
King McManus and two of the King's
kinsfolk and received bruises and wounds
which required medical attention. Late
in the afternoon the witnesses were ex
cused, but the information was received
that the case had not been ignored. Next
Friday the subject may be taken up again.
The Grand Jury is in possession of im
portant documentary evidence concerning
the charges for water supplied to ships at
the wharves of San Francisco. The dis
crimination is said to be startling. In
some cases the water is supplied at a fixed
and reasonable price per 1000 gallons,
which will enable a vessel to get a suffi
cient supply for $25 or $30, while in other
cases the cost runs up to $120 for a ship.
Learning that the Board of Supervisors
would proceed next week with the duty of
fixing water rates for the ensuing year the
Grand Jury sent an important communi
cation to the : board, recommending a re
duction of rates to consumers. . A;
Particular attention was directed to the
onerous tax placed on the shipping in the
harbor of San Francisco, and reference was
made to the special privileges en joyed by
the firm of Goodall, Perkins & Co. "in sup
plying vessels with water. Under this
contract or special privilege vessels are
taxed as high as $1 25 per 1000 gallons. In
some cases a monthly rate of $40 is charged
to steamers that make two trios a month
and do not use more than 14,000 gallons of
water on trip.
The purpose of the Grand Jury is to im
press upon the Supervisors the necessity
of relieving the commerce of San Fran
cisco from unjust and oppressive burdens.
It is contended that it costs but little more
to supply ships at the wharves than it
does to supply manufacturing establish
ments on the water front. On shore the
water is furnished at from 30 to 40 cents
per 1000 gallons. A simple hose attach
ment constitutes _ about the only extra
item of expense in supplying vessels.
CARPENTERS OBJECT.
They Ask That Policemen Be Kept on
Patrol Duty and Not at Build
ing Stations.
, The Carpenters' District Council for San
Francisco sent a petition to the Board of
Supervisors yesterday asking that the
custom of using policemen to do carpenter
work about police stations be abolished.
The document read as follows:
Gentlemen: Your attention is most respect
fully called to a grivanco felt by the carpen
ters of this City in regard to police officers
working as carpenters and doing carpenter
work, repairing and fitting up police stations
of this City and County to the detriment of
our interests as City carpenters. We respect
fully petition your honorable body to make
the appropriation of a sufficient amount to pay
for the labor, as well as the material used in
such work.
The Police Commissioners informed us that
they did not have any appropriations of
money for such work. They told us to appeal
to your honorable body.
We claim this to be an injustice on the
community in the fact that the Chief of Police
being short of the required number of men to
do patrol duty to protect the lives and prop
erty of the citizens and taxpayers, and still
more exposing to danger the lives and prop
erty of the people by withholding those men
from the performance of those duties for which
they were appointed and paid.
The Carpenters' District Council for San
Francisco.
The petition was indorsed by the Build
ing Trades Council of San Francisco.
Against Patrick Donnelan.
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children will prefer charges against Patrick
Donnelan and his wife, living at 4 Merritt
street, to-day. Donnelan is said to be a con
tractor for plastering and by no means indi
gent. Nevertheless his family lives in an ap
palling condition of squalor. The chief cause
of parental neglect is intemperance in this in
stance. There will be a side charge against
Mrs. Donnelan for disturbing the peace in tlie
neighborhood. This is not the first time the
Donnelnns have had an intimate acquaintance
with the society. A. few years ago it placed
their two daughters with the Boys' and Girls'
Aid Society, and to-day an effort will be made
to put the remaining child, a boy nine years
old, In the same refuge.

' Morrow.
The members of the League of the Cross
will renew their pledges at St. Mary's
Cathedral at 2 o'clock to-morrow afternoon.
The affair will be attended with interesting
ceremonies, and the Archbishop will de
liver an address.'
1 The different divisions of the league will

PADEREWSKI PLAYS AGAIN.
Splendid Programme Rendered
Before an Overflowing
Audience.
The San Francisco Women Show No
Signs of Frantic Paderewski
Mania.
. The first. Paderewski recital, given last
Monday, left the population of this burg
in doubt whether its feminine element was
eoing to bow the neck to the great pianist's
yoke. Wednesday's recital showed almost
conclusively that while it admired Pade
rewski as an artist it would not rave over
him as an individual, and yesterday after
noon's recital settled it. San Francisco is
not to endure an epidemic of Paderewski
mania. ....
The applause yesterday, just as it had
been on Wednesday, was warm, enthusi
astic even, but not a woman in the house
split her gloves, and most of the fair ap
plauders* tapped their hands gently to
gether in a way that looked, effective, but
did hot produce a full-blown crescendo of
sound. The men in the audience were
about one to ten women, but, in spite of
being in the minority, they counted as the
noisiest factor in the reception given to
Paderewski's magnificent playing.
The. programme opened, as on.the previ
ous occasion, with a Beethoven sonata.
Yesterday it was the E flat sonata, No. 3,
and again Paderewski delighted all Beetho
ven lovers by his superb rendering of this
master's work. The rest of the programme
was as follows:
Two Songs Without Words, No. 25, No. 34
(spinning song). Mendelssohn
Carnaviil Schumann
Etude, C sharp minor, So. 7, :. "1
Valse, D flat, - , ( ... .
Nocturne, F sharp, No. 2, " A,:... S-cnopin
Sonata, B flat minor, with funeral march. I â¢ 'â - -â  '.:*.'
Nocturne, No. 4. 8.f1at...... . Paderewski
Rhapsodic Ilongroise, No. 12 Liszt
', , The great pianist showed his usual good
nature in the matter of . encores by repeat
ing i the' Mendelssohn . "Spinning Song"
and the Chopin. I .waltz, and playing in ad
dition an etude in Q flat by Chopin and
the Paganini Liszt "Campanella."
At the close of the concert a few dozen
enthusiastic ladies went round to the stage
door to meet the pianist, but tney made
no extravagant demonstrations of admira
tion, and in the California Theater itself
the temperature of the enthusiasm never
rose above mild summer heat.
W. P. Foster's Arrest.
The friends of William P. Foster, the pro.
priotor of the Oriel Hotel, who was arrested on
Thursday night on a charge ef grand larceny,
have an explanation to advance for' the affair.
Dr. F. M. Sponogle stated yesterday that Mr.
Foster was under treatment by him at the
time and had been for some time previously.
According to Dr. Sponogle Mr. Foster is suffer
ing from a nervous disorder which renders
him irresponsible when excited by stimulants
of any kind. The police had been notified of
his condition and instructions had been issued
to the -patrolmen to bring Mr. Foster home
whenever encountered away from home. The
case will be celled to-day, but it is not thought
that Mr. Foster will be well enough to attend.
Guille Will Sing.
Mr. Guille of the Marie Tavary Opera Com
pany will sing at the 11 o'clock' mass Sunday
at the French Church on Bush street.
A MOTORMAN`S LIFE
FULL OF HARDSHIPS, EXPOSURE AND
CONSTANT DANGER.
The Great Strain on a Man's Nerves
Sufficient in Itself to Wreck Him In
a Short Time â The Experience
of a Well-Known Motorman.
From the Cincinnati (Ohio) Enquirer.
The life of a motorman is not a bed of roses.
He is subjected to many hardships, especially
in the winter, when he is exposed to the cold
and snow. Even in the summer he must bear
the intense heat which beats down upon him.
Considerable nerve and self-possession .is
necessary in a good motorman, for the lives
and limbs of his passengers are at stake. One
of the best known, electric motormen in
this city is William Frazer, who is at present
running a car on the Cumminsville electric
line. He Ik not only well known to his fellow
employes, but to the people who : travel
on his car. Mr. Frazer is a' young man about
28 years of age, and resides with his wife and
child at 144 Betts street, Cincinnati,
Ohio. About a year ago Mr. Frazer was taken
with serious stomach troubles. He bought
several kinds of medicine which were recom
mended to him, but none of them seemed to
give him even temporary benefit. An enthusi
astic admirer of that famous remedy known as
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale r-eoi.le told
him to try them. Frazer was almost discour
aged, but took the advice. To a reporter of the
Enquirer he said:
"I can most heartily recommend Dr. Wil
liams' Pink Pills. They are all that is claimed
for them, in fact they advertise themselves
better than any medicine I ever saw. I was
seized some time ago with a bad attack of in
digestion. My stomach hurt me nearly all the
time and I could not digest my food. The
pain was almost unbearable and I found noth
ing that would give me relief. I confess that
when 1 bought the first box of Pink Pills I
hadn't much confidence in their efficacy,
becauso I had tried so many things with
out success that I was almost discour
aged. Before 1 .had. taken, one box I
was decidedly . better. Two boxes cured me
entirely. While I have been under the weather
from other causes my indigestion has never
returned. If it ever should I know just what
to do. I have so much confidence in the ef
ficacy of Pink Pills that if I ever get real sick
again with â¢ any disorder .1; shall use some of
them, it is a pleasure for me, 1 assure you, to
testify to the excellent qualities of these Pink
Pills. They not only tone the stomach, but
regulate- the bowels and act as a mild
cathartic."
â¢ Mr. ; Frazer's testimonial means something.
He speaks from personal experience and any
one who doubts that he. received the benefits
stated can easily verify the assertion by calling
on Mr. Frazer or seeing * him some time while
he is on his car. â¢â¢. .
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills contain all the ele
ments necessary to give new life and richness
to the blood and restore shattered nerves.
They . are sold ;in boxes (never in loose form,
by the dozen or 100) at 50 cents a box. or six
boxes for $2 50, and may be had of all drug
gists directly, or by mail from Dr. Williams'
. Mfedkloe Company Sclu-a-M tedjr t a . li.
COL JOSEPITL FOLLETT,
One of Sheridan's Commanders Saved
by Paine's Celery Compound.
Col. Joseph L. Follett of New York has a
national reputation.
At the age of 21, Col. Follett enlisted in
Battery G, First Missouri Light Artillery,
and soon rose to its command. At Look-
out Mountain his was the only Battery
that reach the summit.
Since the war he has devoted himself to
mechanical engineering, and has invented
several important improvements on ths
sewing machine, and a bicycle that prom-
ises to be one of the surprises of next
season.
The tension on the nervous system of an
inventor, kept up for months and months,
seriously weakened the health of a busy
brain worker like Col. Follett, and his con-
stitution, which even the tardships of war
did not weaken, threatened to succumb to
nervous exhaustion.
What Col. Follett has to say in regard to
his restoration to health cannot fail to
carry great weight. In a letter to Wells &
Richardson Co. of Burlington, Vt., he
writes:
"When suffering from mental exhaus-
tion and a generally disorganized system
and overwork, I used Paine's celery com-
pound.
"The compound acted like a charm on
my bowels and kept them in line condi-
tion, and I experienced great relief from
my brain troubles. j

"I have hot used Paine's celery com-
pound for six months, but I shall when -in
need of a tonic and general regulator of the
system. 1 have recommended it to a great
many, and every one who tried it got
relief.
"It is the best general remedy I ever
used or knew anything about."
When the nervous system has become
weakened from any cause, Paine's celery
compound builds it up as nothing else can.
It makes people well.
People in every walk of life have reason
to be grateful to Prof. Phelps of Dart-
mouth, the eminent scientist who discov-
ered Paine's celery compound.- Be under-
stood the peculiar needs of the nervous
system; he knew that the backache, head-
ache, sleeplessness, loss of appetite and
disordered blood all mean that the nerves
are weakened and inadequate to the de-
mands upon them. The experience of
thousands has proven all over this broad
country that only Paine's celery compound
will give health to the nerves, and through
them to the entire body.
Colleges conferred upon Dr. Phelps their
highest honors for his invaluable investi-
gations in medicine, but all this seems in-
significant in comparison with the chorus
of gratitude that has gone up all over the
world from men, women and children who
have outgrown weakness and the lack of
health by the use of Paine's celery com-
pound, the most wonderful nerve and
blood restorative.

NEW YORK MARKETS.

NEW YORK. N. V., Feb. 14.âLondon selling,'
due to the reopening of the Transvaal question, had
an unfavorable effect on the stock speculation this
morning. The early loss was equal to '4to % per
cent, and nearly'every prominent railway stock
on ii. list participated in the downward move
ment. The decline j was checked soon after the
opening by heavy buying of Sugar and Chicago
<.:s. Sugar moved up from 112% to 115 and
Chicago Gas from 68 to 6914. The rise in the first
named was credited to purchases for lower Wall
street interests, while Chicago Gas was bought by
operators who believe that the Illinois Supreme
Court will decide in favor of the reorganization
committee. Â..'*:*: ...
The strength of the stocks named had a good
effect on the general list and the grangers, Louisville
and Nashville, Leather preferred, Delaware and
Hudson and Lead preferred, all scoring higher
figures. In the afternoon the feeling was less con
fident, the steady withdrawals of gold from the
Bub-Treasury to pay for the new bonds, the failure
of outsiders.to respond to the decisive defeat of the
radical silverites in Congress yesterday and the de
cline in Government bonds having led to sales for

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 1i.i... Feb. 14.â Wheat: Manifested
considerable firmness this morning, the motive
underlying which was difficult to ascertain. It did
not come from abroad, lor Liverpool quoted a
farthing decline at the opening, thereby rejecting
the Influence of yesterday's advance on this side
of the water. The receipts did not show any par
ticular falling off, 182 cars arriving at Chicago and
426 In the Northwest, and' the anticipated frost
did not materialize. The only plausible excuse for
the stre ngth lay in the fact that the market was
oversold and advanced on covering. The bulls
maintained that legitimate conditions favored
strength, while the bears argued to the contrary.
Local inspections from store were 87,075
bushels, and 415.370 bushels cleared at the sea
board. Closing Continental cables were higher for
Antwerp and for flour at Paris. Other quotations
were unchanged to lower. Afternoon prices de
clined rapidly, early buyers finding no bull helps
at hand, turning sellers, and on the slump the low
est quotations of the session were established. May
wheat opened from 66y 2 c to 66S sold between
i' 0,67' 2 1 -' and 661, closing at the inside, s/ 8 c
under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor
row 140 cars.
CORN â Received encouragement from the
strength of wheat aud made a slight gain on that
influence. The receipts were 321 cars, and 8147
I bushels were taken from store. Liverpool cables
were quiet and unchanged. Export clearances
amounted to 160,833 bushels. All the improve
ment was lost when wheal broke. May corn
opened at 30y B e, sold between 30s/ B @3oc. closing
at the Inside, i/iiC under yesterday. Estimated re- I
ceipts for to-morrow 285 cars.
OATSâ Were quiet, but particpated in the
strength of the other grains. The business of the
session i resented nothing notable or worthy of
mention. Receipts were 297 ear s. and 1048 bush
els were taken from store. May oats closed a shade
under yesterday. Estimated" receipts for to-mor
row 230 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash, 9iy_@9l3 / i.c; May,
941 _<-. Receipts were 23 cars.
PROVISIONSâ T.*e heg market very early to
day was firm, but by the time the provision
market opened all the improvement had disap
peared, and product adopted the weaker tone,
Packers were moderate sellers, while commission
men reported good country baying orders. May
pork and May ribs each closed a shade under yes
terday, and May lard unchanged.

DUX'S REVIEW OP TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 14.â R. G. Dun & Co.
will say to-morrow in their weekly review or trade:
failures tor the first week of February $4,079,680,
against $2,909,890 last year. Manufacturing were
$2,372,252, against $729,348 last year and $1,594,
--072 1894, and trading were 91,624.427. against
$1,934. 894 last year and 92.485.585 in 1894.
Failures for the week have been 321 in the United
States, against 270 last year, and 67 in Canada,
against 51 last year. - v* \
The weather still hinders business, also continued
closeness of money and prolonged inaction of Con
gress; hut confidence increases. There is a Utile
more demand for some manufactured products.
Exports Improve with yielding prices of staples,
and for the week from New York exceed last year's
30 per cent, while Imports have Increased 15 per
cent. Piglron at the East and at Chicago has not
advanced. Southern competition continued a;
prices so low that several Alabama furnaces have
stopped, but Bessemer Is a shade lower at Pitts
burg. The demand for plates, sheets and wire
nails continues fairly good, and there are more
orders for railroad cars and bar Iron at Chicago,
but no further sales of rails appeared and the de
mand for finished products keeps but about 70 per
cent of the capacity employed. The coke output
is again much reduced.
: Copper is a shade firmer, while tin and lead are
not active and unchanged. The demand for boots
and shoes is still disappointing, Some makers get
, good orders for women's light shoes, but others
scarcely any, and Boston shipments thus far are
21 per cent less than last year.
Textile work shows little change, though the cut
in print cloths and general concessions in brown
and bleached staples averaging for the whole list
6 per cent since January 1, Induced more buying
which the known accumulation of goods ahead of
demand has hindered.
i Many mills are reporting great profits last year
from the rise of cotton, but the prospect of a
larger crop this year does not promise repetition of
such gains. Though goods still average 12.7 per
cent above their lowest point a year ago, cotton is
now 44 per cent higher than it was then. Sales of
wool have been small for two weeks of February,
but hls-her prices abroad, sustained by heavy ship.
ments of goods to this country, incline holders of
wool here to make no concessions, so that manu
facturers have more difficulty in meeting com
petition.
â produce markets have tended downward, mainly
because supplies exceeded expectations. Wheat
has declined %c. Corn is 11 shade lower, and both
pork and lard a little lower. Cotton receipts at
this season, never large, still indicate a supply for
the current crop year, including stocks brought
over, much In excess of the world's needs, so that,
the prospect of increased acreage has the more
oower to depress prices, and spot co ton has de
clined an eighth for the week. F'xpor s In Jan
uary were $8,653,565 less than last year, though
prices were 45 per cent higher.
Slocks were first a little depressed by heavy
realizing since the sale of bonds, and the money
market has not yet fully settled. The business of
railroads is large enough to justify better results.
Earnings for the first week of February were 9.6
per cent larger than last year, and January reports
are in*- best since September, showing 10.8 per
cent over last year. A3fr_ttSf*B__9a__~fk_
Clearings for the week, 1.4 per cent larger than
last year, are 27.7 per cent less that 1893.

COALâ Harrison's circular says: "During the
week there have been 10 arriva's from the Const
collieries with 20,846 tons: no cargoes from any
foreign port. There is no new feature in this
branch; business generally is dull. The retail
trade has fallen oft since the storms ceased, as It
usually does, but prices are firmly sustained. The
demand for seam uses is fair and quotations are
fairly well maintained, as the arrivals of late have
not been excessive and stocks on hand are not un
usually large, except Anthracite, of which an ex
tremely bountiful supply has been piled up. As
the number of vessels now loading at Swansea is
very light, and freight rates being advanced, what
is now in yard may prove to be profitable property
later on. The sales of Swansea this year will not
hr- as large as in 1895, as the prices of Australian
shipments will be so much lower that the trade
will be deviated in that direction." Wellington $8:

Oakland Office San FranciscolCall, _
90S Broadway, Feb. 14, 1806. j
When Mrs. Lydia Prescott, the secretary
of the California Children's Society, went
to her office this morning she found a
pretty little baby boy in a basket on her
desk. The little follow is just four months
old and seemed to be perfectly contented
in his new quarters.
The lady who left the baby refused to
give tier name, but told a man in. the office
that she had come from Alameda. She
said the baby was left on her doorsteps
several months ago and that she had taken
care of it as long as she could.
Mrs. Prescott took the little boy to the
"West Oakland Home, but she does not ex
pect it to be there long, as it is a handsome
child and she feels certain that some one
will soon adopt it.
BRICK FIRM'S TROUBLE.
The Fortin Brick Company Forced to
Ask Time or Creditors.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 14.â Fortin
Brick Company, one of the leading cor
porations of this city, has been in finan
cial straits for some time, and called a
meeting of its creditors in San Francisco a
few days ago. Mr. Fortin made a show
ing of the business, and, according to his
figures, the assets amount to 5120,000 and
the liabilities to $66,000. . He stated that
if sufficient time were given the debts
could all be paid in full.
The finance committee appointed by the
creditors will report to-morrow to the
creditors. The assets consist principally
of real estate and machinery.
Mr. Fortin Jr. said this afternoon:
"Many of the debts are secured. The
laborers at the brickyards and on the bay
schooners have preferred claims, so they
are safe. Seven-eighths of ail the people
we owe could get all their money what
ever might happen.
. "But land and machinery cannot be sold
for much now, and it would be a great
sacriiice if a settlement should be forced,
but everything will be arranged on a
friendly basis. Dull times are the cause
of the embarrassment."
The principal creditors are: H. Blair,
promi-sory notes, about $10,000; Central
Bank, $30,000. fully -cured; Puget Sound
Lumber Company, $700; H. Cowell & Co.,
$6500; Holmes Lime Company, $4000; J.

airs. Alb; edit Resents a Statement
Made by Her Husband.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 14.â Mrs. Belle
Albrecht, who is suing her husband, Pro
fessor Gustav Albrecht, a church organist,
for a divorce on serious allegations, is
very much distressed over her husband's
statements that she was given to bicycle
riding with Adolph Grueb, a San Fran
cisco optician. the says she went wheel
ing with nitn. but that a lady friend al
ways accompanied them. She says that
she never rode with him, however, until
after her return from Los Angeles some
months ago, where she went, according to
the professor, on an understood agree
ment.
Mrs. Aibrecht has written to her attor
ney, Harry Melvin, that her husband's
statements cast a shadow over her and the
optician that is entirely unwarranted.
Bridge-Builders Laid Off.
OAKLAND, Cat.., Feb. 14.â The district
foreman of carpenters for the Southern
Pacific has called in all the bridge and
depot ganes and boarding-car outfits and
suspended operations for the present. The
result is that about a hundred men are laid
oft. How long this will last is not known,
but it is not expected that any extensive
work will be done before next fall, as all
necessary small repairs can be done by the
section gangs during the spring and sum
mer. Ii is usually about this time of the
year that the bridge department is the
busiest, as the swollen streams make it
necessary to have outfits scattered all over,
to be ready at a moment's notice. So far
this year no great overflows have occurred.
Refused to Show His Wounds.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 14.â Notice has
been given by the railroad attorneys of in
tention to move that the complaint of W.
H. Hntton for $10,000 damages be stricken
from the calendar. The reason for this is
that the plaintiff refused to comply with a
request of counsel to allow his injuries to
be exposed while a deposition was being
taken. A similar point was raised in the
Wettstein suit, and Judge Ogden held that
the defendants could not compel a client
to submit to an examination.
Gift of Thirteen Acres.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 14. â Henry
Curtner of \Varm Springs has donated Ii
tract of thirteen acres, with the building
known as Washington College, situated at
Irvington, to the ladies of the Christian
churches of the Pacific Coast, to be used as
a seminary of learning for girls and young

interest of which shall be used for the
education of deserving orphan &:aj half
orphan girls.

OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 14.â The suit of

that ihe case would be settled out of court.
Judge Ogden granted a continuance till

BERKELEYANS TO VOTE.
Elections for New Schools and a
Wharf to Be Held
To-Day.
Circulars and Replies Theretoâ A
Boom in Track Athletics at the
State University.
_
BERKELEY", Cal., Feb. 14.â The spe
cial election to secure bonds for $120,000
for a new high school and two new gram
mar schools, and $80,000 for. a wharf at
West Berkeley, will be held to-morrow.
The two propositions will be voted upon
separately, and friends of both measures
are confident that the necessary two-thirds
vote will bt cast in favor of the bonds.
The campaign committee of the Good
Government Club to-day issued a reply to
the circular distributed by the "Civic Fed
eration." The Good Government Club's
circular makes answer to the arguments of
the anonymous circular and denies many
of its statements. It is set forth that the
Kellogg School is at present badly over
crowded, and that it cannot be relieved by
any other way than the building of new
schools.
Tbe letter of the Good Government Club
concludes as follows:
ft is not true that the Kellogg School if re
lieved of all other scholars could accommo
date the High School for ten years to come.
On the contrary, the present attendance is
more than sufficient to lill the entire building,
and then in no sense of the word would they
be properly accommodated. It is not true that
ou r last issue of bonds was frittered away. It
Is a ii- Known fact that the schools were let
to th 6 lowest Didder and built at very low cost.
As to the sites, not one of them could be had
to-day for the price paid, while the .Dwight
way lot is worth 50 per cent advance over its
cost.
It is not true that the B6ard of Trustees
hired men to circulate petitions asking them
to call this election.
It is not true that a wharf would last not to
exceed ten years. The private wharf now
there has stood for twenty-five years.
It is equally false that our present Board of
Trustees is wasteful in their methods. Such a
statement can only be made through ignorance
or directly in the interest of bad government.
Voters of Berkeley, will yon listen to the
sophistries of tnose who, ashamed to be known
by their true name, will publish such false
hoods under a norn de plume ? if they are
working for the true interests of Berkeley why
not sign their true names to the circular '.'
Were theyafraid their names might, damage
the cause for which they were pleading ?
If you have the good name of Berkeley at
heart, if you wish steadier employment or
larger trade, if you wish your property to In
crease in value, go to the polls to-morrow and
vote for the bonds. James L. Barker,
John M. Fot,
11. I>. Irwin,
Committee Good Government Club.
Ex-Trustee N. T. Whiting has denied
that ne was in any way connected with the
authorship or publication of the anony
mous circular of which 10,000 copies were
printed yesterday. Mr. Whiting says he
was approached and asked to contribute
$50 to tbe expense of publishing such a
circular, but refused to do so. He submits
the following letter:
Editor Call: In Berkeley items it is stated by
your correspondent, "It is rumored that
George Schmidt and ex-Trustee N. T. Whiting
are the' authors of circular disapproving of the
bond issue." I wish here to state I did not
have anything directly or indirectly to do with
said circular, but so far as my judgment goes I
thihk it the only sensible presentation of the
subject as yet published. N. T. Whiting.
Athletics Booming.
BERKELEY, Gal., Feb. 14.â The pleas
ant spring weather has brought out a
large number of college men who will try
for records on the track and field. .Most
of tbem have had previous experience in
the different events and as a result are more
or less competent to teach the new comers.
The prospect of sending another team
across tbe continent during the present
year has been the means of inciting no
little .interest in athletics. Though the
track and the field and the baseball dia
i mond are attracting many men, yet boat
ing has not been wholly neglected. Class
teams are being formed with the view to
having a series of regattas early in April.
To-morrow afternoon those who are try
ing for the '94 class crew will meet at the
university boathouse in Sessions basin for
the purpose of making preliminary ar
rangements.
Those who have charge of the various
class crews are: Peck, 'GO; English, '97;
Hutchinson, '98; Cole, '99.
The following men are coming out regu
larly for work on the track, most of whom
are observing careful training rules, with
the hope of smashing some university and

Calls the Regular Club

The Rival Presidents Each Express
a Determination to Maintain
Their Prestige.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,) ,
' 908 Broadway, Feb. 14. f
Politics have broken out in the Second
Ward and there is a prospect of some keen
fighting. The climax was reached to-day
when John Mitchell, the Republican Coun
ty Committeeman for the Second Ward,
issued a call for a meeting of the regular
Republican club to-morrow night. Every
body thought the Second Ward Republi
can Club had been started on its active way
a week ago, and that it held a rousing
meeting last night.
Now it appears that the club of which F.
R. Porter is the president is a usurper,
and President P. M. Fisher of the regular
club does not propose to have any of the
glory of presiding over Second Ward Re
publicans wrested from him. He has
Committeeman Mitchell on his side and
proposes to say some very pertinent things
at to-morrow's meeting. J?^'
"There is- only one regular club," said
Committeeman Mitchell to-day, "and that
is the one that I recognize. It is the same
club that has always existed in the ward,
and P. M. Fisher, ex-County Superintend
ent of Schools, is president. There are
over 150 names on the roll, and we are
very strong and do not propose to be put
down by Mr. Porter or any one else. The
club to which Mr. Porter succeeded in
having himself elected as president con
sists of about twenty members. At his
last meeting there were just eight voter-,
and if he has fifty names on his roll
nearly all of them must be boys. Eleven
of our members attended the meeting and,
after seeing the nature of the piece club,
they left in a body, and I am informed
that the hall was nearly empty. Ido not
recognize Mr. Porter, but 1 have called a
meeting of the regular club and have no
doubt it will be well attended. I object
to having voters made to believe that the
Porter club is the regular one. If he has
something to work out and a little club
may help him. of course I have no right
to interfere. The field i? open, but there
is only one regular Republican club in the
Second Ward.
F. R. Porter, president of the other ciub,
holds that any body of Republicans have
a right to form a club, ana he denies the
jurisdiction of Mr. Mitchell to dictate to
any one.
"We have over 100 members on our roll,"
said President Porter to-day, "and we en
roll at every meeting. We have organized
as a McKinley Club, and for the purpose
of trying to get the Republican State con
vention held in Oakland. We passed a
resolution last night to that effect, and
sent a copy of it to the State Central Com
mittee. We are working for the best in
terests of . Republicanism in Alameda*
County, and no one is doing anymore.
We are not organized for any special pur
pose as regards local candidates. Those
matters will be considered later. We or
ganized several days beforo the so-called
regular club held its initial meeting, and
we intend to go on in the way originally i
mapped out." ::.y: :
Both clubs meet. in Milton Hall and the
respective presidents are very energetic.
For nearly a year the county committee
has been divided, and several attempts
have been made to reorganize it and to ap
point a . chairman to succeed Mantalen.
This has proved to be impossible as a
quorum could not be obtained, but as long
as the authority of the ward county. com
mitteeman is disregarded by many Repub
licans, F. R. Porter says ho has as much
right to form a club as has Mitchell.
MRS. CARPENTER'S CLAIM
The Grand Army and a Com

It Up.
Curiosity as to What the New Owners
of the Alameda -Baths Will
Do With Them.
ALAMEDA-,. Cal., .Feb. 14.â Andras
Jorgenson, an old resident, died at his
home, 2015 Clement avenue, last night of
cancer of the stomach. He had long been
ill. but at the last the disease was compli
cated with pieuro-pneumonia. He leavss
a widow and two grown sons.
William Wilson died last night at his
home, 1150 Park avenue, of .consumption.
Deceased was a native of Glasgow and re
sided in Alameda for three years. A
widow and nine children survive him.
Mrs. Carpenter's Claim.
ALAMEDA, Cal., . Feb. 14.â old
trouble that distracted Alameda a little
more than a year ago is likely to come up
again and cause further tribulation. Two
years ago Mrs. Susan Carpenter was in
charge of the Woman's Exchange. The
institution was housed in a building of its
own. Mrs. Carpenter .claimed to own the
buildingâ at least in part. She refused to
vacate and the law was invoked to put her
out* Before it became completely oper
ative she employed house-movers to trans
fer the structure to another lot. They
went to Work at night. The local courts
were invoked by the other side and issued
warrants of arrest for the house-movers,
but without effect. There was a riot
when the house was got into the middle
of the street and blood was shed more
than one person. Finally, after the house
was got half around the. block' the otner
side gained control of it and put Mrs.
Carpenter's things out. They employed
the same gang of movers to continue on
with the building around the block and
back upon the foundation which it had
just left. A new superintendent was elect
ed, but Mrs. Carpenter always claimed
that she had something coming from the
institution. She said she ought , to have
$109. Being the adopted daughter of the
Commodore Porter, she had a claim
on the Grand Array people, and has of
late succeeded in getting them to take the
matter up. Some of the ladies of Alameda
have also interested themselves, and the
trouble which has estranged so many who
were once friends bids fair to rise once
more. â -â ->-
The Long Branch of Alameda.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 14.â The* old
Long Branch Saloon and Garden, at Web
ster street and Railroad avenue, years ago
the most famous resort in Alameda, but
for the past four years closed, having been
sold at Sheriff's sale, is about to be altered
and reconstructed to fit it for general busi
ness purposes. The proprietor of Long
Branch was E. Mayrisch, who twenty -five
years ago owned the Anon, then | located
at Clay/ and ' Kearny streets, San -Fran
cisco, and the great : resort of actors and
men about town. The Arion was .â¢ very
profitable,, and Mayrisch accumulated a
| nice competence which he came to Ala
meda to enjoy. He invested it in a fine
home at the West End and built the Long
Branch in what was then the new partof
town. .He kept a place much more expen
sive than the patronage warranted. His
friends would visit his place of Sundays,
especially after the baths were established,
but he lacked a steady trade and gradually
lost all his capital, and then bis property
Went and he was finally sold out by fore
closure, a poor man.
Alameda Baths.
â¢ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 14.â Some inter
est is manifest as to what will become of
the Terrace Baths. They are now the
property of W. B. Carr", who acquired
them through foreclosure of a mortgage
less than a year ago. In the last two years
they have been nermitted to run down
greatly. The history of the property is
one of misfortune. Six years ago Robert
Haley, the founder and one of the owners,
was instantly killed by the explosion of a
; boiler used to furnish steam to pump
water. Nearly two years ago C. A. Edson,
the remaining partner, was murdered by
an employe. The bad luck has steadily
followed the place until a creditor has
closed down upon it.
GARRITY WENT TO JAIL.
Refused to Pay a Fine for Con
tempt in Judge Woods'
V Court.
Released on Habeas Corpus After an
. Imprisonment of Two
. Hours.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 14. )
Attorney Tom Garrity, who was the
Democratic candidate for District Attor
ney at the last election, spent a few hours
in jail this afternoon while his friends
drew up a writ of habeas corpus. At his
own request he was placed in a cell, where
he received his friends and ate his dinner.
Judge Wood and Attorney Garrity gave
a matinee to-day for the benefit of the
lobby. The attorney was late and the
court reprimanded him. Then Mr. Gar
rity said he did not think the case that had
been commenced was set for that day.
Then the following conversation took
place :
"You continually keep this court wait-,
ing, Mr. Garrity," eaid Judge Wood.
"lam always on time. If you say that
I am not you say. what is untrue," Garrity
replied.- ', aA-'a "-';'
"Mr. Garrity, you are not. We nearly
always have to wait for you."
''If you say that you say what is not
true."
"If you are not careful of your remarks,
Mr. Garrity, 1 will adjudge you guilty of
contempt."
Mr. Garrity then got up and seizing a
I big dictionary threw it down on the table
! with vigor, at the same time remarking,
"I insist on what I said."
"For your remarks, Mr. Garrity, I now
adjudge you guilty of contempt of court
order you to appear at the conclusion
I of this case for sentence." ' â¢
After a few minutes, during which some
| jurymen had been examined, the trouble
I broke out again.
Judge Wood requested the attorney to
prooeed with the case in an orderly man
ner.
"I always proceed orderly," replied
Garrity. -'*â¢=;.â  ->.'
"You must have got out of bed the
.wrong way this morning," said Judge
"Wood. Ââ¢;,>.: A:,
"I think you must have. I don't think
that you got out at all," was Canity's
reply.
"I have already adjudged you. guilty of
contempt of court, Mr. Garrity, and I want
you to be orderly now."
"I am orderly"." -'*'.-"
"I want you to proceed with the case."
"I want to find out why this case. has
' been set for trial before a jury."
"You can find that out afterward. If
I you do not conduct yourself in an orderly
| manner I will have you excluded from the
I courtroom." : ; %
"I have rights in this courtroom. I have
said nothing that is discourteous."
"The records show that you asked for a
jury trial in this case on December 28,"
added the clerk. " .â¢ *:
At the conclusion of the case Judge
! Wood sentenced Attorney Garrity to pay
a fine of $25 or spend twenty-four hours in
jail. Garrity went to jail, and as soon. as
possible a writ of habeas corpus was pre
sented to Judge Ogden.
It was made returnable for next Mon
day, and Attorney Garritvwas released on
$25 bail.

Origin of the Word "Canard."
What is the origin pf the expression "a
canard ' when a wonderful story that has
no foundation in fact is meant? Even
Frenchmen cannot say. It is no w claimed
that the honor of the invention belongs to
M. Cornelissen, a member of the Academy !
of Brussels. He had noticed sonic wonder- '
ful "yarns" in the daily paper to which he
subscribed, and in order to satirize the
writers, he sent in one himself, as a joke.
It was about a pretended experiment with
twenty-five ducks, and tended to show that j
ducks are cannibals. He had, he said
killed the ducks one by one and fed the
survivors exclusively on the body, and in
course of time thore remained but one
ducK of the whole twenty-five. This last
of the ducks was said to have had. a post
mortem examination made of its body
when it was found to be suffering from cer
tain internal injuries as the supposed con
sequence of its strange diet.
The paragraph, which the writer never
expected to see in print, was published and
sent the rounds. It got to America, whence
it was constantly coming back, and the
phrase "It is another canard," or duck, be- I
came common in newspaper offices. Lon

AN OPIUM COOKING PLANT
Officers Are Searching for It in
' . the Hills Back of
Niles.
CERTAIN OF ITS EXISTENCE.
The Raw Material Brought From
Across the Bay and Returned
After Treatment.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
y * .908 Broadway, Feb. 14. ,
For over a month several deputy con
stables and ambitious amateur detectives
have been seeking a fortune in the hills
near Niles. The fortune they want is the
substantial reward that the Government
offers to those who discover stills and
opium-cooking plants. . -A'.A'j
For several months the. authorities have
been convinced that there is an opium
cooking plant located in the hilly part of
this county. It has been known that large
quantities of the crude material smuggled
into San Francisco were brought over here
to be cooked and then returned across toe
bay. The business exists on such an ex
tensive scale and there is supposed to be
such a vast amount of the raw stuff over
here that the lucky man who finds it will
have no need to work for a year or two
after his success. , But up to date John
Chinaman has been smarter than the
officials, and the drug passes to and fro
unmolested. ;"_ .- â¢:"_
About three weeks ago Constable Quel
len caught a Chinaman at Fruitvale re- !
turning to San Francisco with. a basketful
of cooked opium. The Chinese was taken
into custody and given over to the United
States authorities. Although a strict
watch has been kept no one else has been
caught. Several Chinese who come over
from San Francisco regularly with fish and
go as. far as Niles and Pleasanton have
been watched, but although the same ped
dlers have been seen to go to Niies several
times, none of them have ever been seen to
return.
It is supposea that the opium-dealers
make their way to the bay and return to
San Francisco on fishing smacks which
they board along tne bay. Very careful
measures must be taken to avoid arrest as
every avenue is being watched and still the
illicit trade goes on.
The Sheriff's office has been told that
such a place exists, and special deputies
have been sent out to try to locate the
place, but without success. The business
is such a lucrative one that it is more than
likely that some white rancher is in part
nership with the Chinese, and if this be
the case detection is almost impossible.
The hills between Niles and Haywards,
where the plant exists, are particularly
rugged, and it is a practical impossibility
to make a thorough search, or, indeed,
anything but a superficial Ount for the'
cooking plant.
There are several Chinese camps in this
county, and large quantities of opium are
consumed, but,' although numerous
searches have been made,' the stuff has :
pever en found in sufficient quantity to ,
pay for the trouble of locating it. The
search will be kept up until the nlace is
found. -.Ay.

SUPERSTITIONS OP TO-DAY.
Sixpences Bitten by Lucky Cecil Rhodes
and Other Charms.
Cecil Rhodes has the powerful jaw and
the strong teeth that belong to men of his
type. So great has been the luck of this
man that South Africans sometimes ask
him to bite sixpences for luck. A young
Englishman during a recent evening
in bohemia produced the traditional
crooked sixpence from his pocket and
told how Cecil Rhodes: had bitten it.' The
possessor would not part with it for many
times in value. Everybody laughed at the
superstition, but as it turned out nearly
every man present ; had â  some â  such fetich.
Neither he of the : crooked sixpence nor
any of his companions quite believed in
the efficacy of his charm, but each liked to
daily with the superstition.' One of the
company carried an old George 111 penny
to jingle with the loose change in his
pocket. . Another, * opening a little â  ciga
rette-case, . showed a bit of rattlesnake
skin, supposed to exercise a subtle in
fluence upon poker hands.
It was a cosmopolitan, little company of
decidedly modern- v quality, sufficiently
skeptical about many things that ' most
good persons believe, but a majority of its
, members carried charms to bring good
luck. If every such company could be in
duced to make a show of pocket-pieces
and a frank avowal of superstitions lightly
held, but not quite disregarded, the show
ing would rather astonish folks that be
lieve this a skeptical age. The late Eng
lish hangman, Marwood, made a pretty
Eenny by selling bits of rope with uncanny
istories. .
The coral beads brought home from Eur
ope as presents to children are really de
signed ,to keep off evil, spirits. The
branches of the coral are supposed, like
the horns of a horseshoe, to ward off ill
luck. Amber beads are worn by many
excellent persons to keep off erysipelas.
There must be a good many New orkers
carrying the rabbit's foot. A young woman
was seen not : very long ago to stoop
down on a wet and muddy day, pick up a
horseshoe from the pavement of . Fifth
avenue and tuck it away under her water
proof. None of the great ocean liners
sail from this port on Friday. The cres
cents of gold and ivory worn on the watch
chain by many persons are amulets to
keep off evil spirits. Here again is the
horn or prong, as in the horseshoe. -This
crescent is one of the commonest forms
for the so-called watch charms.
The old superstition that a band about
the arm gives strength is still prevalent
among some New Yorkers. Rings made
of several metals, and designed to keep off
rheumatism, are sold by many New York
jewelers. In spito of the fact that the
Thirteen Club has flourished for
many years, few hostesses in any part
of the town would care to head a table
of thirteen persons, for while the hostess
might be indifferent to the superstition, she
could be by no means sure that every one
of her guests would be as free from its
tyranny. Tenement-houses in all parts of
the city where tenement-houses are found
have horseshoes over their doors, and there
is an east side house where the door
knocker is made of two horseshoes, one
fixed to the door, the other hinged to the
first. Don't step over a negro child lying
on the street unless you wish to brave the
rage of its mother. â New York Sun.

SHKEWDNESS IN CANINE HEADS.
An Interesting Tent of the Man-Tracking
Qualities of Bloodhounds.
An interesting test of the skill of blood
hounds in man-tracking through the
streets of a populous city, over ice and
snow, was given in Indianapolis in con
nection with the pet stock show. Four
dogs were entered in the test â Brandy and
Countess, belonging to S. M. -Miller of
'Darlington; Prince, owned by Bowers &
Harris of Noblesville, and Bright, who is
owned by W. S. Fields of Wheaton.
Early in the morning Dr. Bell of Ko
komo left Tomlinson Hall and passed out,
and after walking through alleys and
streets he put on a pair of arctic overshoes
and continued bis walk through the parks
and on the streets frequented by pedes
trians. On the line of march the doctor
saw a runaway team and in Connection
with the crowd assisted in catching the
horses.
He then returned to the ball where the
show was in progress. An hour later the
docs were put on the trail and followed it
with comparative ease, except at the point
where the runaway was halted "and at one
or two other places over which there had
had been considerable travel and around
which the crow.! following the dogs surged
until it was almost impossible to break
through. With unerring instinct, how
ever, the dogs again found the trail, fol
lowed it steadily over the entire line which
Dr. Bell had walked and back to Tomlin
son Hall, where they picked him of a
crowd of several hundred people, going up
to him and indicating his identity by
barking. â Cincinnati Enquirer.

HE IS OWNER OF PUCK
A. Schwarzmann, the Old-Time
Associate of Keppler, in
Town.
HE TELLS OF HIS STRUGGLES.
The Taste for Wit and Humor, He
Says, Is Growing in America
and England.
A. Schwarzmann of New York, proprie
tor of Puck, is at the Occidental, accom
panied by his family. He has been for
three or four weeks in Southern California.
H. C. Bunner. the editor of Puck, is at Los
Angeles now. He has been in a shaky
condition of health for some time and Mr.
Schwarzmann got him to come out with
him for a trip. Mr. Bunner will probably
be ere later. >\ : .y ; .
Mr. Schwarzmann told the interesting
incidents of his and the journal's career
last night. He is a German, as his name
implies, and landed in America a small boy.
He was for fifteen years with Frank Leslie,
and then he and Joseph Keppler started
Puck. That was just a little short of
twenty years ago. The San Francisco
Wasp, the first colored cartoon paper in
America, was started three or four months
before that. ?yi""
-Schwarzmann and Keppler made money
from the start, though they had to do
some close calculating for a little while.
Keppler did the art work, and Mr.
Schwarzmann put on his .thinking cap to
help him out on the ideas. He also kept a
weather eye on the business end of things.
I It was a success from the start.
When Keppler died, as Mr. Schwarz
i mann Paid, other artists came to the
j front. In 1885 Judge ArkeK and Mr. Gil-
I liam, the noted artist recently deceased,
I bought Judge, the other New York col
j ored cartoon paper. It had then lost
i $250,000. The new purchasers put it on a
paying basis. Keppler's son is an artist
and does considerable work for Puck
somewhat after the style affected by his
father.
"The strangest thing is," said Mr.
Schwarzman, "that both journals have
gone right along making a success. Our
circulation has steadily increased. It
shows that the taste for humor is growing.
"One of our brightest men is H. L. Wil
son, who used to live in San Francisco and
Los Angeles. He is associate editor now,
and is managing editor in the absence of
Mr. Bunner. He began contributing for
us, and his articles had so much merit that
five years ago we sent for him to come on
and go on the paper. He never had any
; newspaper experience till be began in the
j desultory way. I believe he bad been a
! typewriter here.
"Probably not 5 per cent of the matter
I sent us is used. We get copy in immense
i quantities from all over the country. Cer
j tain-portions of Puck, as well as of Judge
I and Life, are reproduced in England simul
! taneously with the publication of the same
matter here. The English people like the
matter. Their.taste is growing for it.
"I counted up once the number of funny
papers that had been started and died prior
to Puck in this country. My recollection
is there were over 150. The trouble wa3
I they were not funny enough."
j* Mr. Schwarzmann will be here a week or
two. He will visit San Jose, Monterey
and other points hereabout. He has never
â  been in California before. He is a stout,
I stockily built man of middle age, and
with a slightly German accent.
Joy's and the acid condition disappeared.
I have every rea.sop to believe Joy's Vege-
table Sarsaparilla is a good remedy. lam
informed that this remedy contains no
mineral poisons."
It is made of vegetable. It has no
iodide of potassium, and, of course, acts on
the blood., It produces no pimples.

SCARLET FEVER EPIDEMIC.
Result of the Bad Sanitary
Condition of School Build
ings.
SEVERAL WILL BE CLOSED.
The Board of Health Practically Gives
an Ultimatum to the Super*
visors.
As the result of the bad sanitary condi
tion of the Longfellow School on Silver
street an epidemic of scarlet fever has de- I
veloped in the institution, and unless the |
Board of Education or Board of Super- j
visors take immediate steps to improve I
matters the Board <jf Health will close not
only this but a dozen or more of institu- |
tions of learning, where > the sanitation is j
far from satisfactory.
Among the schools that have fallen j
under the ban of the health authorities |
through the adverse reports of Health
Officer Lovelace are the followine:
Mission Grammar, Webster Primary,
Lincoln Grammar, Everett Grammar, Mar
shall Grammar, Buena Vista Primary,
Columbia Grammar, Fairmount Primary,
Bernal Heights Primary, Horace Mann
Grammar, Irving Primary, Cooper Pri
mary and Longfellow Primary.
The Board of "Education insists that the
Board of Supervisors should provide for
putting the schools in sanitary condition
out of the urgent necessity fund in view
of the fact that its own funds have all been
figured on for other purposes. The Super
visors on the other hand disclaim all re
sponsibility and say that the School
Directors must look after their own affairs.
The Board of Health is not particularly
concerned as to which public fund is drawn
on for the repairs, but the work must he
dona and immediately. The matter came
to a head yesterday at the meeting of the
Finance Committee of the Board of Super
visors when School Directors McElroyartd
Henderson and Drs. Hart, Kosenstirn and
Lovelace of the Board of Health were pres
ent to urge that the necessary money be
appropriated at once.
The}- figured that the work would cost '
about $45,000, and that all schools where
old and out-of-date sanitary appliances
are in use must be at once fitted with i
modern plumbing.
Dr. Kosenstirn explained the reason of
the visit and stated that the Board of \
Health had decided after a careful investi- !
gation that the schools must be repaired at
once or closed.
"These schools are a menace not only ;
to the health of the pupils but to that of !
the community at large," he said, "and
our duties as guardians of the health of
the people compel us to take measures to j
prevent contagion. Already scarlet fever
lias appeared in the Longfellow Schoolâ
three cases having been reported within a
weekâ and ib likely, as well as other dis
eases, to spread throughout the City from
the bad sanitary arrangements. We
understand that it is the duty of the Board i
of Health to do this wort, and we come :
here to urge you to take some steps in the
matter."
Chairman Taylor of the committee stated,
that the Board of Supervisors had no !
power to appropriate any money for such I
a purpose. He said that the committee '
had just been informed by Auditor Brod- i
crick that the urgent necessity fund was I
nearly exhausted and that future drafts
for the present fiscal year must be small.
"The Supervisors cannot Lelp the Board
of Education in this matter,'' concluded
Mr. Taylor.
"Well," said Dr. Rosenstirn decidedly,
when Mr. Taylor had ceased speaking,
"we expect this work to be done. Wooden
appliances must be replaced by modern !
plumbing."
School Director McElroy spoke at some
length on the needs of the department,
claiming that the appropriation for
school purposes is not sufficient to war- I
rant such an outlay, and that the Board
of Supervisors must help out with an ap
propriation. â¢
He was again assured that while the'
committee would like to favor an appro- j
priation, such a measure was ciearlv out j
of its province, and that it must refuse.
Dr. Rosenstirn said, after the meeting I
had adjourned, that the Board of Healtu
would take tlfe matter up at its regular !
meeting on Wednesday next, and that !
something would probably be done to i
convince the Board of 'Supervisors that the
schools must be attended to, and at once. '
"It would be a shame to close these
schools now in the middle of a term," he
said, "for it would prevent several thou
band pupils from attending to their '
studies, and throw hundreds of teachers |
out of their employment: but this matter
must be attended to, and the Board of
Health will not stand 'idly by while the i
public safety is at stake. We will take j
stringent measures to remedy the evil if :
necessary."

ODDS TO ANOTHER WORLD
The Poolrooms in Telephonic
Connection With an Under
taking Parlor.
Downtown Sports Backed Horses That
Were Scratched and Jockeys
That Did Not Ride.
When the InKleK'.le track closes on
Wednesday next, the last day of its two
weeks' spell of racing, a sigh of relief will
escape the lips of the gamblers running
the downtown poolrooms. The deter
mined warfare waged upon them by the
management of the Pacific Coast Jockey
Club has not been without its effect.
Wrong results, odas quoted that were
ridiculously lower than at the track and a
bad mixture of jockeys have seen the
crowds in the dens dwindle away day
after day since the meeting began, until
they are at present in a very tottering con
dition.
If the meeting at Ingleside was to con
tinue two weeks longer- the pool-sellers
would have to close their doors; but they
live in hopes, for the Bay District track
will soon cpen again and they look for
ward to uninterrupted facilities for ob- '
taining odds and results.
As though the shadow of deatn was i
hovering over them the meaner and
grossly incorrect news they obtain from
Ineleside is telephoned to an undertakine
establishment at 777 Mission street, doing
business under the name of Pacific Under
takers. An employe of one of the rooms
was heard to remark that they had a
'â¢dead cinch" on getting the returns, and
this statement was evidently; not without
some truth attached to it.
Yesterday a boy was interrupted at the
track who, it was thought, was trying to
smuggle out the result of a race, and the
following message was found on him:
1 have got two bunches roses ready, also ten
bOqUCtS. .\_ ':;*..>;"'
Possibly the Jockey Club can utilize
them in the shape of a floral offering at
the funeral of these "joints" in the near
future. The message, which was a cipher, i
the boy said he intended to telephone to '
the undertaking establishment mentioned.
The commission houses received Peck-;
sniff as the winner of the third race, which
was won by y Uncertainty. The latter
horse was as good as 60 to 1 at the track,,
while the rooms very obligingly laid their
customers 4 to 1 against the outsider.
Seven wrong jockeys were posted in the
opening event, and odds and jockeys' were
marked up on two scratched horses.
Throuehout the other races wrong riders
were posted and the most absurd odds
laid. AyryA
Invariably horses scratched early in the
morning at the track had odds offered
against them with a far-fetched guess as
to who would ride them. Betting was
opened on most of the races before tbe
book-makers at Ingleside had chalked up
their odds, the "joints" having their
prices up on the third race nineteen
minutes in advance of the track pencilers.
Of the forty jockeys that piloted horses
in the live different events the uoolrooms
were misinformed as to twenty-five of that
number.
FLOWERS AND GOPHERS.
{ State Floral Society Chose Marble Hall
as Permanent Meeting Place.
The State Floral Society has found Mar-
J ble Hall at the Palace Hotel so satisfactory
j that it has chosen it as a permanent place
i of meeting. That decision was reached at
the monthly meeting held yesterday.
There was a small exhibit of hyacinths,
Mrs. T. C. Walker winning the premium
I for the finest specimen of potted hyacinths,
! the award going to a handsome single
j white La Grandesse, and Mrs. W. H.
I Smythe carrying off tbe honors for the cut
j flowers, spikes of Baron Thuyll, Queen of
Holland, Czar Peter and other choice va
rieties.
"Winter Blooming Roses" was the chief
topic of informal discussion.
A favorable report from the Santa Cruz
Mountains Floral Society, the youngest
offspring of the parent society, was read
and discussed.
A letter from Mrs. Theodosia B. Shep
herd of Ventura describing a new variety,
of cosmos received attention. *"/,'''-*â¢ '.';';:;*
Mrs. W. S. Chandler, Mrs. O. D. Bald-
I win, Mrs. B. E. Hendrickson, Mrs. Grbth
! well and Emory E. Smith were appointed
| additional members of the committee on
| monthly exhibitions.
One of the ladies asked for an antidote
;to the destructive gopher, and various
members recommended bisulphide of
carbon, broken glass, a trap baited with a
1 carrot and a "black cat.'*'
The floral exhibit, although, strictly
, speaking, a hyacinth show, included some,
' exquisite Swanley white and Russian
violets, sent by Miss Lottie Emerson of
Decoto, a rare specimen of epiphullum, or
â¢ lobster cactus, and of amaryllis amanti

Abandoned Their Child.
Mrs. St. John San Jose gave a six-months
old infant, Jharles Grant Gordon, into the cus- |
tody of the Society for the Prevention of Cru- '
elty to Children yesterday and the babe was '
sent to St. Joseph's Infant Asylum. The child, .
who is remarkably bright and pretty, is the
son of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Hunt Gordon, who, !
prior to their departure from the city, lived at
144 Sixth street. They gave him into Mrs. St.
John's care when he was a mouth old and lor i
a short time paid a stipulated sum for his sup
port. Lately tney lett off the payment, and
finally left the city without leaving any direc- !
tions as to the disposition of 1 lie infant. Mrs. I
St. John was unable to bear the burden of his !
support, but parted with him with reluctance. [
THE STOCK MAKKET.
There was no material change yesterday. If any
thing values were a little lower.
The liexter Cold Mining Company of Colorado
has been listed on the San Francisco Stock Board.
The Bulwer weekly letter says:'
Bi'tWKH Con-.â Have extracted 10% tons of ore
:of an estimated value of S'2H per ton f ro"m the stopes
; on" Bulwer tunnel and 200 levels during the past
; week. In the stope above the north drift from
crosscut 2, 200 level, the country rock con
tinues very hard, and the or- seam, being small.
makes extraction slow and diillciilt. Kiope in drift
south trom crosscut 4, 200 level, continues to
yield some low-grade milling ore. Drift from raise
above north drift, 100 level, was extended 10
ft c. along the foot wall: face in vein matter of no
value.
A letter from the Gray Eagle states that in the
face of the tunnel they have 3*2 feet of fine-look
ing blue gravel, showing a prospect by pan wash
ing of $6 to a carload. The gold is getting coarser,
showing more of the channel or lead gold. Have
rnn 12 carloads to the mill and are running rle
track grqde in bedrock. They are now 5 ) feet from
the face of it. As soon as they reach the face they
will commence crosscutting; and hreasting the
gravel for the mill.
The superintendent Is now satisfied that he has
reached the lowest place in th- channel, and that
the rock will not pitch from them again.

A BURGLAR SHOT TO DEATH BY A BUTLER.
Battling for Their Lives
in a Darkened
Basement.
THE ROBBER SUCCUMBED
Young Frank J. Miller, the
Slayer, Dangerously-
Wounded.
THE DEED OF A HERO.
Fighting Against Overwhelming Odds ,
to Save the Life and Property
of His Employer.
The apotheosis of vigilance and crime
could hardly be better illustrated than it |
was yesterday morning in the residence of ;
J. L. Franklin, at 2930 California street.
The dumb and the dead, wrapped in
each other's embrace, lay on the hard
flooring of the basement as mute evidence
of a battle for life. The struggle was only
partially successful, and the criminal lies
dead at the Morgue and a faithful servant i
lies at death's door in his master's com
fortable home.
The story t# a magnificent one of hero
ism on one side and desperate want on the j
other.
It occurred at 4:45 o'clock in the morn- [
ing. Frank J. Miller, who is a well-built
lad of about 20 years of age, and who has j
been a butler in the service of J. L. ,
Franklin for the past two years, was get- i

ting ready to rise, according to his custom,
to collect the newspapers and other things
placed by milkmen and bakers on the
front stoop. His room, in the basement
of the three-story mansion, was provided
with an electric push button and a bell by
which his employer could be notified if
there was anything wrong downstairs, or
he could be called to the upper stories if
his services were needed.
Regardless of the push button which he
could have used to call for assistance,
Miller bravely jumped outof his bed when
he heard strange footsteps in tne base
ment. He pocketed his revolver and went
out into the dark to investigate.
Opening the door of his room, and step
fin*: out into a square hallway between an
assem My or banquet room and the kitchen,
he found himself confronted by three
masked men, with pistols raised in a
threatening manner.
You , hold up your hands!" one
fellow said. "If you open your head I'll
blow it off." .â -. -Ay .
The salutation was thoroughly in keep
ing with the surroundings. The burglars
carried a lighted candle, and their general
make-up was in accord with the most ap
proved melodramatic style of a hold-up.
Miller complied with the order and held
his hands un high, showing the burglars
his intentions to be non-aggressive.
The heavy-set man cf the trio, who
seemed to be the leader, pushed Miller uo
against the kitchen partition and ordered
him to remain there.
"Matt," he spoke in an undertone,
"keep him covered till we get back."
"Matt," who is now at the Morgue, did
as he was instructed. He held his 38-

caliber five-shooter to Miller's head while
' the other two burglars disappeared up the
winding stairs to the parlor floor of the
house.
The men carried a bundle with them
which afterward proved to be the tools
with which they intended to work their
way into the different rooms.
' At the heart of the first flight of stairs
they encountered the electric wires fur
nishing lights and telephone service; also
the tap to the gas meter. The latter they
turned off, depriving the house of gas.
and with their nippers they severed the
electric wires, placing the entire house so
that no light might be sprung on them.
In their hands, however, they carried
lighted candles and they worked their
way to the upper story, where they began
their work on the room centrally located
and which happened to be the music or
sitting room of the family.
It was at this juncture that the tragedy
of the night occurred. Miller, who was
! being held up with a revolver against the
kitchen partition, was working his brain
; to see how he could get out of his unpleas-
I ant predicament. His arms had become
J so weary held high in the air that they
gradually worked downward.
"Keep them up!" the burglar shouted
l under his breath. "Keep them up or I
; shoot!" he threatened.
â¢ Miller heard the men at the top of the
stairs cut all the wires, and in the stillness
of the basement he could detect their foot
fall on the heavily padded stair carpets
leading to the upper story.
It was a terrible ordeal. The man who
was covering him with a gun threatened
to shoot if he did not bold his hands up,
and it was a physical impossibility to
j longer remain in that attitude. Then
I again, his master, his mistress, their
! daughters and sons whom he loved were
! likely at any moment to be molested, per
haps killed.
The entire situation resolved itself in
his brain in; less time than it takes to
i write it.
He remembered how, some years ago,
the 15th of last January, three burglars
had broken into his master's house. They
beat and gagged him .when he fought
them. He drove them away, however,
and. saved his employer's goods. One
newspaper, in commenting on the at
tempted burglary, hinted that it was pos
sibly a creation of the butler's excited
brain. This cut the lad to the quick and
he stated then that if it ever occurred
a_ain to him to face ; burglars he would
sacrifice his life sooner than permit them
to be masters.
He remembered, too, that the three mis
creants who had his employer's house at
their mercy had failed to search him and
that his revolver was still in his pocket.
If he could only get it out for use he might
make away with the fellow -"Matt," who
was guarding him.
"Matt" took his eyes away from Miller
only a second, turning his head as if to
listen to what was ; going on upstairs.
That was the time for action, and the
butler's right hand was slapped on the
burglar's pistol in an instant.
Then the struggle began. The burglar
was of a much slighter build than the
butler, but he had the pistol and both
tussled for the weapon, Miller all the time
reaching around with his left hand to
draw his own weapon in his trousers
pocket.. He succeeded in getting it par
tially out when his handkerchief caught
in it and down it fell to the floor.
Miller's efforts after that were to disarm
his adversary and also to get his own
pistol. Reaching down for the latter he
left an opening. The burglar struck him
square in the face with his left fist, felling
him. But he still held ' his grip on the
threatening pistol, and in his fall he
dragged the burglar along with him.
. As they rolled over the floor Miller
managed finally to reach the revolver with
his left hand. In doing so, however, he
lost his grip on' his adversary, and then
the shooting began. It was terribly wild.
Shot after, shot rang out, each man parry
ing or thrusting aside the aim of the
other. In the scuffle the butt of the bur
glar's pistol smashed the thumb of Miller's
left hand,' splitting the. nail and causing
the upper part of the: thumb to be torn
away. He nearly lost his weapon then.
The burglar fired his fourth shot, and
Miller was struck in the "neck. The bur
glar was on top of him and he had little
faith in saving his life. In one last des
perate giip he encircled the fellow's neck
with his right arm and, placing his pistol
at the man's head, he fired- twice, in rapid
succession.
There was no more shooting after that.
Miller Â«*wooned from the pain of the
bullet in his neck and his crushed thumb,
and on top of him in what 'â  appeared a
brotherly embrace, the robber lay dead. ;
The battle in the dark between the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1896.-
burglar and the butler was all over, -and
the most terrific known to the police of
this City.
While the shooting iand the struggle was
going on downstairs the people in the
upper apartments were in a terrified con
dition. Twice before they have been
treated to visitations of the kind, and they
immediately realized what was going on.
From all sides they threw open windows
and began blowing police whistles. Within
a minute, Oflicer F. J. Green, who is on
that beat, responded. He found Mr.
Franklin in his nightshirt.
"The house Is full of burglars !" ex
claimed the frightened man.
Green ran around the back way and
found the kitchen door open. He rushed
in and lighting a taper saw the ghastly
scene. The men lay partly in the kitchen
and partly in the hallway, across the
threshhold, as it were.
By this time Officers J. Alvares, John
O'Connor and Herlihy came along and
Green ordered the latter two to attend to
the front of the house. Â ? ;1 ; y;
"Watch the front door!" he exclaimed.
"Hers are two of the burglars. They're
dead, but the others must be upstairs; I'll
go up and chase them."
About that time Samuel Solomon, the
son-in-law of Mr. Franklin, came down the
service steps and recognized the under of
the prostrate men. as Miller, the family's
butler. He was relieved of the other man's
weight and it was seen he was still breath
ing. The burglar, too, gave a gasp, opened
his eyes and the butler was all over, and

Physicians from the neighborhood were
called in and caused a bed to be made on
the floor where Miller was lying, and he
still reposes there, as moving him might
cause a hemorrhage which might cause
immediate death.
While these preliminaries were going on
and the Morgue and police patrol wagons
were on their way out, the house was
being searched from cellar to dome.
The first thing observed was tbe candle
grease all over the kitchen floor; next the
telephone and etectric wires dangling in
their uselessness. The front door was
wide open, being left so probably as the
two other burglars made their escape while
the shooting was going on downstairs,
On the top floor, in front of the music
room door, the lockpicks, skeleton keys,
candle, blow tubes and a knife were found,
The men had not had time to either use
them or carry them away.
Two masks made of a yellowish material,
such as might be used for the lining of a
woman's dress, were found in the house.
One was alongside the dead man and the
other upstairs. On the sidewalk outside
the bouse was a woman's dark veil, which
was also fashioned so as to do for a mask.
In the blood of the two men in the base
ment were a couple of revolvers, each with
four chambers fired and one loaded,
From the wounds inflicted the burglar
must bave used the 38-caliber "Universal
double-action" weapon, and the butler the
32-caliber "Hopkins & Allen."
Miller remained unconscious for Aye
hours, after which he was able to tell the
story here related to Samuel Solomon, who
gave it to the police.
The physicians decided not .to allow him
to speak any more until he is stronger.
He was found to not only have been shot
in the neck, but also in the foot, as well as
to have to the police. his left thumb.
The physicians decided not to allow him

c was found to not only have been shot
the neck, but also in the foot, as well as
have an injury to his left thumb.
At the Morgue the, dead man was sub
jected to close scrutiny. He was clad in
the tattered garments of a tramp and he
was fairly reeking with vermin. He quite
evidently has not fed on the fat of the
land, for his body is emaciated to a pain
ful degree. He is of blond complexion,
with short red hair and stubby mustache.
On his right arm were found the tattooed
initials M. O. D. and a large star. On his
left arm is a smaller tattooed star. The
man, who. from all appearance, must
have been a seafarer at some time, is as
yet unidentified. Miss Jennie, a girl in
Mr. Franklin's employ, declares she re
members the dead man as one who ped
dled Los Angeles oranges last week and
â who rang the doorbell and offered his
wares for sale.

Captain Lees is in hopes that the dead

month or so ago. In his pockets the

robbery.
At 1 o'clock this morning Dr. Washing

San Francisco, FeD. 14, IB9G.
Captain I. W. Leesâ Dear Sip. : Acting under
your instructions, and in company with De
tective Ed Gibson and Ed Wren, I went up to
the Franklin residence, 2930 California street,
to obtain an interview with Frank Miller, Mr.
Franklin's butler; and obtained the following
statement from him at 9:30 i*. m., above date:
I woke up at the usual time, about 5 o'clock,
and left my room in the basement to turn on the
electric lights. I found that I could not light them,
and then I attempted to light the gas. I got some
matches and tried to light the' gas, and found that
the gas would not light either. This was still In
the basement of the house. Then all of a sudden
I saw three men in the middle of the hallway, in
the middle of the entrance near the stairs. All
three of the men wore masks and all three of tbem
had pistols. The three of the men leveled the
pistols at my head and told me to keep still and
not to move. 1 had nothing in my hands then
save a few matches. 1 had a pistol, though, in my
pocket. I was accustomed to get np at this time
and go to the front door to get the morning papers
and then come aown again to wash. One of the
men grabbed hold of me and bad his pistol leveled
to my head, and he walked in front and the other
two were at either Bide of me, and led the way to
the kitchen.
They had just one lantern and a small candle.
The fellow with the lantern led the way and the
others followed. They were a little undecided as
to who should stay with me. The biggest fellow
hart the lantern, and he wanted to go upstairs, but
they finally decided .to leave the biggest man
downstairs, and he kept his pistol leveled at my
head and the other two fellows went away. At
the time 1 did not know, just where they went, as
it was so dark. There was just a piece of the
candle they had burning. This candle was either
on the kitchen chair or table. We were at this
time in the kitchen. When the two men left I \
afterward heard a door close above me, and then I
knew that they had gone upstairs.
. All this time the man had his _un pointed at me.
1 was terribly excited and for a moment did not
know what to do. I knew that I had a gun in my
pocket, but did not know how to Ret at it. Ii o
ticed that while he bad the gun in my face he was
very nervous and his hand was trembling very
much. I waited I should judge about three min
utes and gazed steadily at him and watched his
hand a3 it trembled. Then I suddenly grabbed
him ny the wrist and he wrestled with me, and
then he tired the first shot. I got my hand around
his neck and grabbed his wrist and held the pistol
away from me. Then I grabbed for my pistol and
I suppose I was so nervous that I dropped it after
Retting; it out of my pocket. We were still wrest
ling and he was trying to get me down, and I had
just stooped down to grab my pistol from the floor
when we both fell together.
As we fell he discharged his pistol again and the
trigger of his pistol caught me rieht on the thumb.
Then we were on the floor and -1 1 grabbed my
pistol: he had fallen on top of me and his head
was right on me, so I put my pistol to his head
and I shot the first shot at his head and he just
fell back and moaned. I fired three or four shots
successively." The first shot he fired I believe
struck me in the neck. While we were wrestling
on the floor he hollered for his friends, but none of
them came down to his assistance: also while he
and I were wrestling he said something to me I
did not quite understand, but I' suppose he was
cursing me. '' - -
After I fired my gun I do not know what hap
pened as I became unconscious. It would be im
possible for me to describe these men as it was so
dark and they all had masks, the only light there
being the lantern and the small candle, but they
were all pretty good-sized men: the biggest man
was the one I was wrestling with. None of the
men wore overcoats. All three of them had pis
tols. 1 did not have time to look around or any
thing, it happened so quick, He, the man I was
grappling with, had a very harsh voice, and when
he fell one hand fell under him and the other hand
I held by the wrist. That is all I know about the
case.
Miss Rena Moore, in the employ of the Frank
lin family, made the iollowing statement:
It was about a quarter to 5, 1 believe, when I
heard the first shots fired. First I heard one shot,
then three or four more In succession. I went
downstairs right awayâ about three or four- minutes
after the shootingâ and found the side middle door
and the front door wide open. When I got down
stairs, I saw the body of the burglar and the but
ler lying on the floor in the kitchen, the butler was
unconscious, and Frank still had his hand on the
burglar's head.
Very respectfully, O. H. Heykeman.
BULLETS MISS THE MARK
Deputy. Sheriff Brownlee Fires
at Deputy Sheriff By
ington.
Arrested and Locked Up on a Charge
of Assault to Murder â Row
Over a Loan.
Deputy Sheriff Brownlee shot twice at
Deputy Sheriff Byington last night, missed
his mark and was arrested and locked up
on a charge of assault to murder.
The affair took place late at night in
front of the City Hall restaurant. Larkin
street, almost opposite police headquarters.
The two deputies had been together dur
ing the early part of the evening and were
standing on the sidewalk in company with
several friends.
Brownlee asked Byington for the loan of
a couple of dollars. Byington refused,
saying that Brownlee had "not done the
square thing" with him on some previous
occasion.
The lie was passed and Byington struck
Bromlee, knocking him down.
Brownlee drew his revolver and fired.
Byington started to run and Brownlee get
ting on his feet fired again. He was
about to fire a third time when his arm
was caught and held by a bystander.
Officer McCottery was just across the
street at the time. He arrested Brownlee.
Both parties to the affair refuse to make
any statement as to their differences, or
the real cause of the trouble, though it is
understood that there has been some bit
ter feeling between them for some time.
Byington has been a deputy in the Sher
iff's office for some years. He was not ar
rested, but went to his home after the
shooting.
Brownlee emptied his revolver about a
week ago in a saloon ceiling on Ellis
street. He reloaded the weapon and going
out on the street began firing it again,
when a bullet struck a hackman in the
foot. Brownlee was arrested for discharg
ing firearms in the City limits, which case
is pending In Police Judge Campbell's
court.
LOUDERBACK AND
GALLAGHER CLINCH.
Opposing Attorneys Had a
Fist Fight Over the
Brown Case.
SEPARATED BY FRIENDS.
Duties of Lawyer Woodhams in
the Council Clearly
Defined.
MRS. COOPER MAKES A REQUEST.
The Case of Mrs. Mary A. Davidson
Will Come Up Before Judge
Bahrs To-Day.
There seems to be considerable doubt as
to what figure Attorney M. S. Woodhams
will cut in the council called to pass on
the charges affecting the moral status and
good name of Dr. C. O.Brown. It will be
recalled that on Wednesday night last he
was delegated to represent thÂ« First
Church during these interesting proceed
ings, but as to the latitude of his pcwers
nothing was said.
A gentleman who is thoroughly familiar
with Congregational usage thus defines
the attorney's privileges: Mr. Woodhams
will represent the church only to the ex
tent of presenting to the council in proper
form the records leading up and including
the call for an investigation.
No power has been delegated to him to
make suggestions as to the policy to be
pursued by the council. The church as a
body is supposed not to have an opinion
except the one of law, which supposes a
party innocent until proven guilty. Con
sequently any instructions from the church
as to what evidence is to be admitted is en
tirely out of place. The council and not
Mr. Woodhams, as representative of the
church, must pass on the acceptance or re
jection of evidence its relevancy to the
matter in hand.
Mrs. Cooper has written a letter to Mr.
Woodhams, in which the request is made
that things be so arranged a3 to admit of
her being heard by the council. This
letter, with such others of similar import
as might be received, will, when the body '
is formally organized, be turned over to j
the moderator, whose duty it will be to lay I
it Before the council. She will be asked to
briefly outline her charges, after which
the council will pass on their merits.
Mrs. Cooper has not yet completed the I
general statement of the case as she un
derstands it, which is to precede the intro
duction of proof. Just what this evidence |
will be is, of course, a matter of conjecture, '
though there is a current belief, and Mrs.
Cooper does not deny it, that Mrs. Tunnell
will be her principal witness. It is now not
thought probable that Mrs. Stockton will
appear in any capacity , whatever before
the council. Mrs. Cooper has practically
admitted that she did not intend to call
her. This determination is said to be due
in a measure to the many episodes in
which Mrs. Stockton is alleged to have
been a prominent figure.
In this connection it is proper to say
that the statements published some time
ago, in which Dr. Brown is said to have
admitted paying Mrs. Stockton $600, was a
mistake. The lady herself admitted this
during the early stages of the case. Dr.
Brown has called attention to this, hence
the Correction.
A rumor was current yesterday that
Miss Overman had on Wednesday night
left Dr. Brown's house and gone across
the bay with a view of taking up her
temporary abode at the home of a .friend.
Miss Overman has at no time left Dr.
Brown's house since she first went there
in December last, unless accompanied by
the pastor's wife. It is her purpose to re
main there until after the council has
heard her statement. After this it is her
purpose to return to her home in Tacoma.
Letters by the score are still being re
ceived by both Mrs. Brown and Mrs.
Cooper indorsing the course of each. Dr.
and Mrs. Brown have received over 500
letters and Mrs. Cooper nearly as many.
A few days ago there was an exciting
encounter in one of the main corridors of
the new City Hall between Attorneys
Gallagher and Louderback, in which both
gentlemen claim a victory. Just how
many blows, if any, were struck seems to !
be a matter of dispute, but a perfect volley
of words not carefully chosen are admit
ted to have been hurled by the angry at
torneys at each other. The story goes
that the two gentlemen met by accident in
the corridor on the Larkin-.treet side of
the building, and after exchanging formal
greetings began a discussion of the Brown-
Davidson case.
The argument waxed warmer and
warmer, until finally somebody said some
thing about "unprofessional conduct, 'and
then they clinched. How far this pro
ceeded is not a part of the story, for
friends separated the thoroughly angered
attorneys before either had come to any
bodily harm. The interested parties de
cline to discuss the affair.
The case of Mrs. Davidson, charged with
extortion, will be set for trial by Judge
Bahrs to-day. Attorney Gallagher will
enter the usual demurrer, and he has
strong hopes of securing a dismissal of the
charge. He will argue that it is admitted
by the prosecution that Elizabeth Jane
Baddin exists, and that Mrs. Davidson
acted as her agent. The information
plainly states this. Mr.' Gallagher will
further say that Mrs. Davidson is being
tried as principal, when she is only charged
as being an agent of some one else. This,
he argues, is against the Criminal Code.
The last issue of the Pacific, a Congre
gational organ, contains the following:
The rather recent transference of minis
terial standing from the Bay Association to the
Bay Conference may . have confused some
brethren's mind. We print the following
from article VII, section 2 of the constitution
of the latter body: ".When the standing of a
minister or of a church of the conference is
called in question, it shall be the duty of this
committee (i. c., the committee on credentials)
to entertain specific charges from responsible
persons to inquire into the case and to report
to the conference, which shall then proceed
according to the Scriptural method and ex
tent." ;
With the well-known and long-tried method
of investigation by the local church through a
council, and, in addition, the possible pro
cedure through the conference, it need not be
said that our polity cannot protect itself and
its membership and its ministers. If they do
not receive protection it will not be the fault
of tl\e polity, but of those who misrepresent it,
and we must protest again that neither Con
gregationalism nor Christianity is on trial, but
only those who" are charged with unfaithful
ness to the principles of both.
Mrs. Barton is indignant that any one
should have said that she was the mys
terious Mrs. Baddin. She disclaims all
knowledge of this person except that she
holds a certificate in the World's Co-oper
ative Society. Mrs. Barton says, however,
that she Knows a great many . things, but
will tell them only to the council or on the
witness-stand. .
THE TEACHERS' FUND.
ItÂ« Right* in the Fair Litigation Under

There is opposition on the part of the

the first Fair will. The "fund" is inter

ested to the extent of $50,000 in the pencil
will, and is therefore in opposition to any
proceedings under the first will. William
Pierson and Garret McEnerney represented
the claims of the original document and
D.M. Delmas represented the pension fund.
Mr. Pierson argued that the pension
fund had no rights in the matter what
ever, as the gift to it in the pencil will was
invalid. He contended that the $50,000
was left in trust to a fund which was not
at the time in existence, nor was there any
definite prospect of it materializing. By
leaving the money thus indefinitely, coun
sel claimed it violated the law prohibiting
perpetuities, and so was invalid. Mr.
Delmas will answer Mr. Pierson's argu
ment some time next week.
DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND.
John A. McCormick, a Chemist, Charged
â¢ With Grand Larceny for Trying
to Kecover His Own.
John A. McCormick of 777 Folsom street
was booked at the City Prison last evening
on a charge of grand larceny, preferred by
Simon Greenbaum Jr. McCormick is a
chemist by profession. He claims to be
more sinned against than sinning that he
is the victim of a sharp practice.
He says that he saw an advertisement in
a newspaper offering to pay big interest for
a small loan with ample security in the
shape of diamonds.
He wrote to the address given, received
a note from Greenbaum, met him and
agreed upon terms. He loaned Greenbaum
$363 50 and received as security two pairs
of earrings, two studs, two rings, two scarf
pins, one star pin and seven other pieces,
cuff-buttons and rings, all with diamond
settings.
Greenbaum gave him a note for the sum
loaned, and in the agreement attached it
was stipulated that McCormick should bo
permitted to sell the jewels in case tho
note was not paid.
The note was not paid and McCormick
put the diamonds in the hands of an auc
tioneer to sell, giving Greenbaum notice to
that effect. Greenbaum was at the sale)
and bought in the diamonds for $240.
This left McCormick $152 17 short on the
deal, counting the interest. In order to
get even he negotiated the purchase of
certain of the diamonds from Greenbaum
to the value of $160. He secured the dia
monds, placed them in his pocket, put
$7 85 in money on the counter and handed
over Greebaum's note to square the ac
count.
Greenbaum, seeing his intention, made
a grab for the diamonds in McCormick's!
pocket and secured one of them from its
setting. McCormick struck at him; there
was a scuffle, and Greenbaum ' called
'Police."
An officer responded, and McCormick
was taken to the lock-UD, where he spent
the night.

mittee of the Thirty-fourth Assembly Dis
