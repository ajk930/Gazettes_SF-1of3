DEEDS THAT CHILL THE BLOOD
An American Citizen Writes of His
Experiences â Dwelling in
Fear of Death.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 22.â The
following letter was received in this city
yesterday by a prominent gentleman of
this city from an American in Cuba:
"I 'wrote to you a few days ago and yes
terday I received your letter of the 3d, the
first I have had from you since I left. 1
see no possibility of leaving the island, as
things are getting worse and worse every
day. Owing to the last news from your
side the feeling against, us here is very
titter and I am fearing from one day to
another some public manifestation against
us and some one will perish.
"As to my going to the country, it is
almost suicide, as they are killing people
right and left and letting them lie in the
fields to be eaten by the vultures. I have
seen ten of those unfortunates after ten or
twelve days killed, among them a poor
friend of ours, and another friend has
disappeared and I fear that he met with
the same fate. I have been told that
there are here scattered about thirty or
forty Dodies, but I did not care to see
more than the ten I saw, as it made me
sick â the siphtand the smell.
"I have been tired at twice. Fortun
ately for me, the first day I happened to
be away from the piazza where I had the
habit of sitting after breakfast. They
seemed to know it. As a force of Spanish
troops passed the place from the highroad,
they firea at the house and most of the
shots struck the piazza. The second time
I was going from the place to another
plantation, and on the road that separates
that place from ours again they tired at
Â»}Â«. *witfor*Â«-nÂ»<ety in both cases no barm
was done. Our friend, the doctor, is also
on the missing 'lists. I hope he has been
able to get away ; otherwise he will meet
the same fate that so many others have
met.
"I do not care to mention names, other
wise I could relate to you a great many
atrocities that have been committed in
this neighborhood. I could not believe it
at first, until I made up my mind to go
and see for myself. There have been
cases of a Cuban, a poor man, being killed
be-fore the eyes of his own wife and chil
dren for no reason whatever.
"If 1 should ever see you again I will tell
you things that will make your blood run
cold. I have often heard of the cruelty of
these people, but I must confess I did not
believe half of it until I saw with my own
eyes and now I am ready to believe any
thing that is told me of their horrible
deeds."

THE INDIANAPOLIS RIOT.
Intense Excitement Follows the Bloody
Conflict of Saturday Evening,
Eight Arrests.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., March 22.â The
riot last evening at Chandler <fc Taylor's
foundry has been followed by intense ex
citement among the laboring classes of
this city, and during the day large crowds
assembled around the works and discussed
the yituation.
As there are several non-union men in
the foundry who were recently brought
here by the proprietors, it was feared that
another outbreak niisjht occur, and a
heavy guard of police was kept around the
foundry all day. Though the union
molders and their sympathizers were in a
bad humor, no attempt was made to inter
fere with the men inside the works.
The strikers say they have kept up the
fight against the "scabs" for more than a
year, and they propose to continue it until
the foundry becomes unionized; that the
men who are employed in their places are
mostly foreigners, and if they are made to
feel that organized labor is against them
and will accept no compromise they will
eventually be driven out of the city.
Eight arrests of persons engaged in the
riot have been made.

SHE LOVES A BURGLAR
Frank L. Tupper Sues for Legal
Separation From His
Wife.
Daughter of a San Francisco Contractor
' Involved in a Scandal in
Boston.
BOSTON, Mass.. March 22.â Literary
Boston was astounded last week to learn
that Charles S. St. Zelcki, a bright young
litterateur of Polish extraction, was the
notorious burglar who plundered Back Bay
flats of jewelry valued in the thousands.
He said he did it to avoid starving. The
police say he did it to satisfy the cravings
for money and jewels of his landlady. Mrs.
Frank L. Tupper, who, within a fortnight
separated from her husband on his ac
count. Now the wife is suing for a divorce
on the ground of cruelty, while the hus
band will retaliate in kind, naming St.
Zelcki as co-respondent. Mrs. Tupper is
an exceedingly handsome young woman,
refined and well educated. To a reporter
she said to-day :
"My husband's charge is false. That I
received jewels from Charley is true, but
the police have taken them away. I loved
him; I do yet. lam sure my husband
cannot prove his statements. Were he in
San Francisco he would never live to re
peat them. Yes; lam a Californian. My
father is a contractor in San Francisco and
lives on Nob Hill. I cannot tell his name;
it's bad enough for me to be mixed up
with a burglar."
Frank L. Tupper says: "I felt that
sooner or later my wife's acquaintance
with this man would become known. Her
conduct grew bo unbearable thai a week
before Christmas I turned her out of my
house. She was constantly in the com
pany of this young burclar. Before this
man's arrest she visited my mother's
house and induced our little girl to accom
pany her to her flat. The child has told
me of many things she saw. No, I can't
tell you her maiden name. I married her
in San Francisco, where her father is doing
business as a contractor. It would not be
right to show him up. He always used
me right."
PROTEST OF yEBRAÂ»KA.\S.
A Bill Before t^/e House in the Interest
of L'ind-Orabber*.
LINCOLN, Nebr., March 22.â Settlers in
Western Nebraska counties have united
in a protest against the bill introduced in
the House by Congressman Andrews pro
viding for the cession to the State of large
bodies of Government land on condition
that the State provides systems of irriga
tion. The main objection of the settlers is
that the land, in case she Government sur
renders it, will immediately be seized by
.syndicates to hold for speculation, and the
settlers will thus be deprived of its use for*
grazing and hay cnttinir, which is about
i heir only means of livelihood. Persons
familiar with the land claim it is non
irrigable, and that while Congressman An
drews is doubtless honest in his inten
tions the bill is merely a land-grabbing
scheme. Protests will be sent to Washing
, ton this week.

Rear Admiral Makaroff of the Russian Navy
Highly Pleased With the
Battleship.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 22.â Rear
Admiral Makaroff of the Russian navy,
who was aboard the battleship Massachu
setts during her builders' trial trip, in
speaking of the vessel's performance, said:
"1 was greatly impressed by the care
shown by the Cramps in studyine the
workings of the machinery with a view to
improvements, if any might be made. I
was also greatly pleased with the ship.
Ten years ago we were accustomed to sen
very old-fashioned ships in your navy and
we are now glad to see that our friends
have such line ships everywhere."
As a battleship, he considers the Massa
chusetts superior to many others, and es
pecially in the range of fire, and he
thought she had an astonishingly good

thinks she has sacrificed slighily her free
board, but as she is for coast defense he
thought this defect was perhaps not im
portant. As compared to the great Rus
sian battleships in the Black Sea, which
he considers the best in Europe for con
centration of fire, Admiral Makaroff ad
mitted that he considered the Massachu
setts superior for concentration in firing.

Lori Salisbury Announces a Change
From His time-Honored
Policy.
â 
LONDON, E*a, March 22.â Lord Salis
bury has written a letter to Sir James
I Stausfeld, who was chairman of the recent
demonstration in Queen's Hall in favor of
the principle of arbitration In all disputes
between Great Britain and the United
States, acknowledging the receipt of the
memorial adopted at the meeting. In his
letter Lord Salisbury says:
I am glad to be able to inform you that this
question is receiving the consideration of her
Majesty's Government, and that proposals in
the direction indicated by the memorial are
now before the Government of the United
States. â¢ Salisbury.
The memorial referred to contained the
following :
"Without expressing any opinion upon
pending controversies, we would earnestly
press the advisability of promptly conclud
ing some treaty arrangement by which all
disputes between Great Britain and the
United States could be referred for adjudi
cation to some permanent tribunal repre
senting both nations and uniting them in
the common interest of justice ana peace "
In moving the adoption of the memorial
Mr. Shaw-Lefevre, formerly president of
the Local Government Board, submitted
the following resolution, which was
adopted:
That the chairman be instructed to forward
the memorial, wheu signed, to the President
of the United States, to the Prime Minister and
to the leader of the House of Commons, with
an earnest desire of this meeting, that no time
may be lost in taking action thereupon.
He said that almost twenty-eight years
ago he enlisted the almost unanimous
vote of the House of Commons in favor of
arbitration on the Alabama claims. At
that time the first cable had just been
laid and Cyrus Field telegraphed the
whole of his speech across the Atlantic.
The speech was apparently so heavy that
it broke the cable. Since that time about
forty arbitrations had taken place, in ten
of which the United States was concerned
and in eight Great Britain was a party.
In 1884 Great Britain negotiated a treaty of
commerce with Venezuela, in which, for the
first time, there was an arbitration clause;
but the treaty was not ratified, as Mr.
Gladstone's Government went out and the
Foreign Office permanent officials, he be
lieved, thwarted his well-meant efforts.
In its issue to-morrow the Daily News,
under the caption of "A Breaic in the
Clouds," will deal with Lord Salisbury's
reply to Sir James Stansfeld, which it de
scribes as the most hopeful word that has
been had for s long time from the Prime
Minister. The paper says it hopes that no
efforts will be spared to press the consider
ation by the Government of the memorial
into action. The Daily News elsewhere
traces the arbitration movement from the
resolutions adopted by the American Con
gress in 1890 and tne House of Commons
in 1893, and from President Cleveland's
message in the latter year. It proceeds :
"When Lord Rosebery became Prime
Minister he took the matter up with the
unanimous approval of the Cabinet. He
intimated to Sir Julian Pauncefote, the
British Embassador to the United States,
that should President Cleveland act upon
the resolution of Congress, which requested
him to invite negotiations with this Gov
ernment with a view to establish a system
of arbitration, the British Government
would welcome such an invitation. Since
then nothing has been done. We hope
Lord Salisbury's letter means that substan
tial proposals have been made."

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
THE REVOLUTION
IN NICARAGUA.
More Serious Than Indi
cated in the Press
Dispatches.
HONDURAS MAY STEP IN.
Insurgents Daily Gaining Ground
and Confident of Ultimate
Victory.
A REVIEW OF THE SITUATION
All Five of the Central Americaa
Republics May Yet Become
Embroiled.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 22.-Tha
revolution in Nicaragua, according to In
telligence received through private chan
nels to-day, is more serious than the dis
patches from that country would indicate.
The strict press censorship established by
President Zelaya renders it impossible for
news of any character, except what is
favorable to the Government, from being
made public. Two facts, however, in the
opinion of those thoroughly familiar with
existing conditions, seem to be well estab
lished. First, that Zelaya is not suppres
sing the rebellion, and second, that the
Honduran troops which arrived in Nica
ragua on Friday last as the supposed allies
of Zelaya are quite as likely to aid the
rebels as to act with the. Government
troops.
The first of these facts is based upon tho
almost certain knowledge that the revolu
tionists have not lost ground ; that they
are confident of success, since in every en
gagement they have been the aggressors;
that they have the moral and material sup
port of the great majority of the Liberal
party which placed Zelava in power, and
that the Government forces have main
tained from the beginning a puTely defen
sive attitude.
The Honduran troops are now in Nica
ragua at a point midway between Leon
and Corinto, in the territory occupied by
the rebels. Their present attitude is one
of strict neutrality, but it is regarded as
not improbable that their aid may in the
end be given to Baca, the provisional
President of the insurgent government.
Color is given to this belief by the inti
mate relations that have long existed be
tween General Ortiz, the commander of
the insurgents, and President Bonilla of
Honduras, who, in point of fact, owes his
present elevation to the services rendered
in his behalf several years ago by Ortiz.
If Honduras espouses Baca's cause, the
latter will, it is believed, become victori
ous, since his troops are armed with mod
ern guns and animated by sentiments of
the loftiest patriotism, inasmuch as they
are fighting for constitutional liberty and
to prevent the alleged dictatorship of Ze
laya. Without Hoduras' aid the result is
likely to be in doubt for several months at
least.
Another element of uncertainty is the
influence which the Salvadoran Peace
Commission may exert upon the contend
ing factions. That their efforts will result
in failure is believed to be probable. Baca
and those associated with him are deter
mined upon the overthrow of Zelaya,
while Zelaya, on the other hand, is equally
determined upon the suppression of the
rebellion, neither side being willing to
concede any advantage to the other.
In these circumstances a review of the
events which led up to the present sitna
tioa are of interest. Several yÂ«ars ago
Zelaya headed a movement which had for
its purpose the overthrow of President
Zavala, who was elected through conserva
tive influences. The movement succeeded
for a few months and Zelaya served as

provisional President until a new consti
tution had been formed, making the Presi
dent ineligible to re-election, when he was
formally elected Chief Magistrate for the
ensuing four years.
In January last it became evident that
Zelaya purposed setting himself up as dic
tator. During t!ie latter part of February
the Vice-President of the republic, Baca,
who was also Minister of Finance, resigned
his office and, crossing the lake to Leon,
erected tLe standard of revolt against Ze
laya. His example was followed a few
days later by Madriz, the Minister of For
eign Affairs, and General Alonzo, the Min
ister of War.
A large number of the members of the
Assembly, who were Liberals in politics,
also identified themselves with the new
jnovement, and have established a govern-
Tnent at Leon, which it is claimed is the
only legal government now in force in the
republic. The military head of the revo
lution is General Ortiz, who was promi
nently identified with the overthrow of
Zavala in 1892, which resulted in Zelaya's
succession.
Zavala, who is still conspicuous as one
of the Conservative leaders, has now joined
icrces with his former enemy. Zelaya, in
the Jatter's endeavor to quell the rebellion,
and their association, therefore, furnishes
fresh proof of the truisfti that "politics
make strange bedfellows."
The rebels, as previously stated, have
been defeated in several engagements, but
this, it is asserted, is because of their rash
attempts, to capture strongly fortified
towns. That they have done this is re
garded as an indication of their confidence
in themselves, while the failure of the
'iovernment troops to follow up their ad
vantage is considered a proof of their
inability to act other than on the defensive.
Shrewd observers of political events in
Central America believe that before the
present troubles end all five of the re
publics may become embroiled, unless a
peaceable solution is reached within a few
weeks. _____^__^____
IRK BEFORE CONGRESS
The Cuban Resolutions Will
Again Come Up in the
Senate This Week.
Morgan Will Make an Effort to at
Least Pat the Upper House
on Record.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 22.â The
failure of the Senate thus far to act upon
the questions involved in the Dupont case
and on the conference report on the Cuban
resolutions retains them in line as un
finished business for the coming week.
The Senate's attitude toward the Cuban
resolutions has been materially affected by
the joint resolution offered at the close of
Friday night's session by Morgan. It is
understood that he will press bis joint
resolution to a vote for no other purpose
than to put the Senate on record.
The legislative and judicial appropria
tion bill, which is in charge of Cullom,
will bs called up at the first opportunity.
The provision changing the compensation
of United States Marshals and District
Attorneys from fees to salaries will doubt
less cause debate, but otherwise there is
little in the bill that should precipitate
discussion. The bill to approve the com
promise made between the United States
and the State of Arkansas holds its place
as the unfinished business, but Berry has
not pressed it.
Beyond to-morrow, which under the
rules is to be devoted to the consideration
of business reported by the Committee on
Affairs of the District of Columbia, there
is no programme of business arranged for
the House of Representatives this week.
Chairman Babcock says he will not have
enough business to engage the attention
of the House for an entire session, unless
some wholly unexpected opposition to
some one of the measures on the calendar
from his committee should develop.
The naval appropriation bill, owing to
differences in the committee having it in
charge, mainly over the appropriations for
battle-ships and for drydocks, has not been
fully completed, and it is not expected to
be reported before the latter end of the
week. That had been depended on by the
managers to occupy most of the time be
ginning Tuesday, and they have nothing
of large importance to take its place.
Two minor pension bills of a general na
ture are on the calendar and an opportu
nity will doubtless be afforded to press
them to passage.
The Committee on Ways and Means has
before it for discussion and action at its
meeting Tuesday the "filled-cheese" bill,
reported from the sub-committee last
week. Those particularly interested in its
progress believe that the full committee
can agree upon a report that day. Should
that be done the bill will doubtless be
taken up a day or two later. It will be
vigorously fought in the House and a long
debate is certain to ensue whenever it
does come up.
CEXSUti OFFICE FIRE.
Inside of the Building Damaged to the
Extent of $20,000.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 22.â At 2
o'clock this morning fire was discovered
burning furiously in a building on E street,
near Ninth, occupied by the Census Office.
The inside of the building was badly dama
ged, involving a loss of about $20,000,
fully insured. Probably the most serious
loss will be to the records of the Census
Office contained in the building, some of
which were destroyed and all more or less
injured by smoke or water. The building
was known as Marinis Hail and was the
place where the Knights of Pythias organ
ization was born.
THE PACIFIC ROADS.
Xetc Bill to Be Reported by the House
Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 22.â The
sub-committee of toe House Pacific Roads
Committee had arranged for a meeting to
day, but did not assemble. It is now gen
erally conceded that, as wired to The Call
heretofore, the bill reported will be drawn
on the lines of the Frye-Smith bill and
will follow it closely if It does not employ
the identical language of the measure.
Representative Barham of. California will
appear before the House Committee on
Tuesday in answer to some criticisms of
his former argument before the committee.
Purse for Corbett and Mitchell.
LONDON, Exg., March 22.â George Ste
vens of the Bolingbroke Club offers a purse
of $12,000 for a fight between Corbett and
Mitchell in London. He also offers $500 to
eacn man for training expenses.

GERMANY JOINS
WITH ENGLAND
The British May Draw on
the Egyptian Reserve
Fund.
FRANCE IS IRRITATED.
The Kaiser Assents to the Ex
pedition Up the Valley of
the Nile.
FRIENDLY TONE OF THE PRESS.
Sympathy With Italy Causes This
Sudden Display of Goodwill
Toward England.
BERLIN, Germany, March 22.â The of
ficial announcement that Germany had
given her assent to England's drawing on
the Egyptian reserve fund to defra}' the
cost of the British expedition up the Nile
Valley, which was published in the North
German Gazette, was worded in such a
manner as to convey the impression that
Germany's assent was not given to con
serve English interests, but rather for the
sake of upholding the interests of the allies
of Germany included in the Dreibund, es
pecially those of Italy. Two articles on
the subject which were suosequently pub
lished in the Gazette were a trreat deal
more cordial toward England, and the in
tention seems to have been to dispel all
traces of the German irritation toward
England, to defend the Dongola expedition
as an inevitable and indispensable move
ment and to predict the ultimate recogni
tion by Europe of the value of the opera
tions of the expedition In controlling the
destructive power of the dervishes.
Other inspired journals are now taking
the same view. The National Zeitung
denies the contention that France may
possibly create international trouble
because of the fact that Egyptian troops
are seeking to reoccupy Egyptian terri
tory.
As late as 1894, during the dispute over
the Congo agreement, the Zeitung says,
the French Government maintained that
the Soudan provinces were legally Egyp
tian territory, although they were in the
hands of the barbarians.
The Tageblatt holds that the evacuation
of Egypt by the British is England's affair,
and the Kreuz Zeitung says that France
cannot oppose a punitive expedition
against Soudanese malefactors.
The Cologne Gazette, in an article
obviously inspired by the Foreign Office,
contends that the Dongola expedition is
absolutely imperative. "The union of
dervish forces, which are now divided by
the Egyptian advance." it says, "might
have the effect to drive the Italians out of
Kassala ana so strengthen Abyssinia
against Italy and ultimately enable France
and Russia, who are now lurking in the
background, to determine the fate of
Khartoum and the whole region of the
upper Nile."
Tue key to all this sudden display of
goodwill toward England is unquestion
ably German sympathy with Italy. If the
battle of Adowa, fought on March 1, in
which the Italians were disastrously de
feated, had not occurred, Germany would
not have countenanced the expedition up
the valley of the Nile, and probably would
have sided with France and Russia to
prevent it.
A curious incident connected with the
situation has arisen from the overtures
which were made by France with the ob
ject of ascertaining Germany's intentions
in regard to the expedition. The com
munications'from the French Foreign Of
fice which passed through the hands of M.
Herbette, French Embassador to Germany,
were couched in language which indi
cated expectations that Germany would
join the French protest against England's
action. It consequently must have been a
very unpleasant surprise to M. Berthelot,
the French Foreign Minister, to learn that
the assent of Germany had already been
sent to London and to Cairo, and the fact
must certainly have caused the French
Government to surmise that the Emperor
knew more, and at an earlier date, of the
designs of Great Britain than could have
Deen obtained through the ordinary diplo
matic channels.
It is now conceded on all sides that M.
Herbette must be recalled by his Govern
ment, and very speedily too. The posi
tion described in these dispatches on Feb
ruary 26 has become intolerable. M. Her
bette has made himself so obnoxious to
the Emperor that his Majesty is reported
to have on more than one occasion ab
sented himself from Berlin in order to
avoid the duty of receiving him. M. Her
bette's rank as dean of the diplomatic
corps would naturally bring him oftener
into personal contact with the Emperor
than if some other diplomat held the rank,
and there is reason to believe that a per
sonal meeting with the Emperor is as dis
tasteful to the French Embassador cs it is
offensive to the Emperor.
The feud between them is of long stand
injf. Besides this difficulty M. Herbette
has made himself disagreeable to many of
the German officials with whom he has
come in contact because of his exceedingly
brusque and altogether bad manners, and
to Prince Hohenlohe, the imperial Chan
cellor, he haÃ become almost intolerable.
The consequence has been that Prince
Hohenlohe has formally asked M. Berthe
lot to appoint M. Herbette's successor, and
the German Embassador to Paris has ad
vised the Chancellor that the difficulty
experienced by M. Berthelot in sending to
Berlin an Embassador who would be per
sona grata to the Berlin court is likely to
be overcome by the acceptance of the posi
tion by M. Decrais, formerly French Em
bassador to London.
An interesting debate arose in the Unter
haus on Wednesday during the discussion
of an interpellation asking the intentions
of the Government in regard to dealing
with the question of American meats.
Professor yon Mendel launched a pro
longed tirade of invective against Ameri
can corned beef and all canned meats, and
in the course of his remarks gave an in
stance of the wife of a Berlin journalist
having been poisoned by the use of such
goods.
Other similar cases, he said, were not
uncommon, and amid the cheers oi the
Agrarian members of the Chamber he
urged that it was not sufficient that Amer
ican meats should be certified as h ealthy
by American inspectors, but that the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 23, 1896.
whole carcass must be inspected by Ger
man inspectors before it could be admitted
into the country. In regard to American
oleomargarine he declared that control of
the inspection of that product by Ameri
cans was inadequate, Americans not
exercising proper sanitary precautions, as
their interests are solely commercial,
Fraiherr yon Hammerstein-Loxten,
Minister of Agriculture, replied that it was
impossible to inclose Prussia within a Chi
nese wall. He said that the existing pre
cautions were sufficient, and thought that
the Agrarians could make capital enough
out of the alleged cases of Texas fever in
German cattle said to be traceable to the
importation of American cattle.
The Freisinnige Zeitung says that the
intention of the member whose interpella
tion precipitated the debate was merely to
ask the Minister or Agriculture for an of
ficial report upon American meats. The
debate closed before the question became
opportune and the matter will be brought
up again, as there is reason to believe that
the allegations made against the American
products are mere fiction.
The Kaiser was present last week at a
conference of art experts. Ministers and
court officials, who had been summoned to
inspect a site and plans for monuments of
the rulers of Prussia which are intended to
be erected in the Sieges Allee of the Tbier
garten. The Kaiser critisised the designs
freely, and urged the artists intrusted with
the modeling of the statues to exercise a
rigorous avoidance of everything which
could possibly invite ridicule. He said:
"I know my dear people of Berlin. Do not
give them a chance to joke over your
work." The artists who were present are
of the opinion that the Kaiser is very dif
ficult to satisify.
Emm Pasha's daughter. Farida, has won
her case against the claims to the explor
er's estate made by his Constantinople
wife and by the decision of the court will
receive an estate valued at 26,000 marks.
There has been much quarreling over the
property left by Emm Pasha, the some
time Governor of the equatorial province
of the Soudan, to rescue whom from the
Mahdists, Henry M. Stanley made his last
trip to Africa.
After Emm arrived at the coast with
Stanley, be entered the service of Ger
many. Later he left this service and went
into the great forest with a few of his re
tainers. Many rumors of his death were
circulated, but they proved to be untrue
until about two years ago, when it was de
finitely learned that he had been mur
dered by an Arab chief named Kibonge.
No will of Emm's was found and this fact
ied to much litigation. Emm, who had
become a Mohammedan, had married a
native woman, by whom he had a daugh
ter, Farida, who is now about 12 years of
age and who is being educated in Ger
many.
Mr. Mounteney-Jephson, who was with
Emm throughout the rebellion in the
equatorial province, Jheard of the trouble
over Emm's property and then remem
bered that he had a will made by Emm in
his possession. A copy of this was made
and sent to the German Foreign Office and
the document put an end to the fight for
Emm's property.
In October, 1888, Mounteney-Jephson
and Emm were prisoners in the hands of
rebellious soldiers at the station ot Dufile,
on the White Nile. Both had been sen
tenced to be hanged. Thinking his end
was near Emm made his will, leaving
everything he had to Farida, who was his
only child. This will was given to Mount
eney-Jephson on the understanding that,
should he be able to escape he should take
the child with him to Mr. Stanley's camp.
They all, as it turned out, reached the
coast in safety, and Mr. Mounteney-
Jephson, naturally supposing that Emm
before returning to the interior had exe
cuted another will, regarded the will in
his possession, which was made in Dufile,
merely as an interesting document with
out any legal value.
The annual banquet of the Reichstag
which took place in the Cupola Hall of
the Reichstag last evening is ignored by
a large number of the Berlin and provin
cial newspapers because their editors did
not receive invitations. The Neuste
Nachrichten says that the character of the
celebration was indicated by the fact that
Prince Hohenlohe felt obliged to stamp
out the toast to Prince Bismarck on the
ground that the ex-Chancellor was not an
official.
The National Zeitung says: "The pres
ent Reichstag has been a great disappoint
ment to Germany and has proved itself
impotent. It has held seventy sessions
and not ten of them have had a quorum
present. The body ha 3 lost all respect in
the eyes of the Nation.' 1
The surviving officers and men who
formed in 1870 the Emperor's Grosse
Hauptquartier held a banquet to-day.
Herren Zetche, Hiller and lschemert
have been convicted of stealing and fur
nishing to the socialist organ, the Vor
waerts, a copy of the Emperor's edict
granting amnesty to certain political pris
oners on the occasion of the celebration of
the twenty-fifth anniversary of the foun
dation of the empire on January 8. Zetche
and Hiller were sentenced to three months'
imprisonment and Tschemert to one
month.
The Emperor in consequence of his an
noyance at the disclosure of his intention
to visit Rome incognito at Easter has
abandoned the idea.
The German competitors in the Olym
pian games at Athens will leave for that
city on March 26. They comprise the
champion eleven gymnasts of Berlin, two
skiff-sculling champions, four runners and
six bicycle riders.
Mrs. Evans, wife of Captain R. K. Evans,
military attache to the United States em
bassy, will receive the mejnbers of the
American colony in Berlin on Tuesday.
BRITAXXIA IX FROXT.
Wins in an Uninteresting Race in a
Faint Breeze.
MONACO, March 22.â Most of the yacht
racing on the Riviera thus far this season
has been characterized by strong mistrals
or almost flat calms. The racing here to
day was perfectly uninteresting, owing to
the fact that there was not enough wind
to permit the yachts to finish before sun
down. The regatta opened with the sun
shining brightly and a faint breeze
stirring. Boon after the start was made
the wind died away and there was scarcely
a riDple on the face of the sea.
The Britannia, which was the first to
cross the line, held the lead throughout
the day and won the race as dusk was
closing in. The Ailsa was second. The
rase for twenty-raters was won by Mr.
Ogden Goelet's Samphire. The prize won
by the Aiisa yesterday in the race from
Cannes to Nice was Â£600. The prize won
by the Samphire in the twenty-rater class
was Â£400.
Injured Xear Redwood City.
REDWOOD CITiT, March 22.â William
Lovie, a well-known wheelman, was
thrown from a horse to-day and sustained
a compound fracture of the right leg be
low the knee. Lovie is a resident of this
city and a member of the California Bi
cycle Club of Ban Francisco. In the
annual relay race Lovie is usually de
pended upon to do a fast ten-mile turn,
and.this injury will result in a serious loss
to the Calitornias.
THE NEW YORK
REPUBLICANS.
State Convention Delegates
Are Flocking Into
the City.
HOTEL LOBBY ACTIVITY.
Ex-Senator Platt Is Confined to
His Bed Through an
Accident.
ENTHUSIASTIC MORTON MEN.
Platt, Depew, Lauterbach and Miller
for Delegates-at-Large to
St. Louis.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 22.-The
majority of the delegates to the Repub
lican State Convention which will con
vene next Tuesday to elect delegates at
large to the National convention at St.
Louis have reached this city. They were
very much in evidence at the different
hotels to-day.
During the early morning hours and late
in the evening the Fifth-avenue Hotel was
the Mecca of the delegates and the lobby
was alive with politicians eagerly discuss
ing affairp political. Neither Chairman
Hackett nor Thomas C. Platt was to be
found about the hotel lobby during the
day, and this fact caused considerable
comment. It was learned that Chairman
Hackett was confined to his room with a
slight illness. Late in the afternoon the
fact leaked out that ex-Senator Platt was
confined to his bed owing to a somewhat
severe accident which happened to him
last Friday evening. It seems that Mrs.
Platt, who is a heavy woman, suffered an
attack of vertigo while standing in her
room.
Mr. Piatt was near her at the moment
and endeavored to prevent her from fall
ing. Mrs. Platt fell into her husband's
arms so suddenly that it took the ex-
Senator off bis feet and his side struck
against a projecting piece of furniture.
Some say the blow was so severe that Mr.
Platt received a fracture of one of his ribs,
but others say he was only severely bruised
and shaken up. At any rate he has been
unable to leave his room for two days.
During the day the principal topic of dis
cussion indulged in was the National Presi
dency. Morton men, of course, predomi
nated, and the chances of New York's
Governor for the nomination were glow
ingly set forth. A number of guberna
torial booms were brought to town by
leading Republicans, but discussion upon
the question did not assume any definite
shape.
All arrangements for Tuesday's, conven
tion are completed and the programme
has been practically decided upon. Grand
Central Palace, where the delegates will
assemble, has been elaborately decorated,
and has a seating capacity of 4000. The
convention will organize at noon Tuesday
with Senator Cornelius R. Parsons of
Rochester as temporary chairman. After
transacting minor routine business, such
as the presentation of contests and the ap
pointment of the usual committees, an.
adjournment will be taken until 7:30 p. m.
When the convention reassembles Con
gressman Southwick of Albany will be
the permanent chairman. Unless the
slate is suddenly changed Thomas C. Platt,
Chauncey M. Depew, Edward Lauterbach
and Warner Miller will be chosen as
delegates-at-large to the St. Louis conven
tion. The naming of the thirty-four Presi
dential electors representing the Congres
sional districts and the two electors
representing the United States Senators of
New York State will very liKely be deferred
until the Republican State convention
m the fall.
Although the platform of the conven
tion has not been decisively passed upon
by the F artv leaders, the main features
have been drawn up and sanctioned. The
leading feature will be the financial plank
which will be a strong declaration in favor
of "honest" money. In addition to ex
pressing unalterable opposition to free
silver coinage at the ratio of 16 to 1, or any
other ratio, except in the event of an in
ternational agreement, ie will insist on the
maintenance of the public faith with cred
itors of tne Nation by maintaining gold
payment of all public debts. In this re
spect it will be a far more pronounced ex
pression than any other financial plank
adopted at a State convention thus far dur
ing the Presidential canvass.
The tariff plank will be a strong declara
tion in favor of the policy of protection to
American industry and for reciprocity.
This plank will be very short.
Another plank will indorse Governor
Morton's candidacy for the Presidency,
setting forth his qualities as a business
man representing business interests.
The name of Major McKinley is not
likely to be brought forward in the con
vention, but if it does come up the leaders
say it will be in a very feeble way.
OHIO'S ZIBRARIAX OVSTKt).
Be Bitterly Antagonized the JForaker-
Buthnell Interests.
CHICAGO, 111., March 22.â A special
from Columbus, Ohio, says: Senator For
aker, through Governor Bushnell, has
overthrown State Librarian Joseph P.
Smith. The latter's enforced resignation
is announced. The stab was no less at
McKinley, who in tne last days of his ad
ministration insisted upon Smith's con
firmation.
Mr. Smith has been one of the most
faithful and astute of the ex-Governor's
friends and managers. There was never a
McKinley move that was not first decided
upon by Mr. Smith, or upon the advisabil
ity of which his opinion was not consulted.
The bitter opposition of Smith to the
Foraker-Bushnell interests could not be
overlooked. Moreover, it had been claimed
that Smith had been largely instrumental
in the Grand Jury investigation instituted
for the purpose of bringing an indictment
against George B. Cox, the efficient first
lieutenant of Foraker, and that the State
Librarian had even said that Foraker
would be in the penitentiary before he be
came a member of the United States Sen
ate. It was therefore arranged that Smith
should be permitted to resign. After pre
senting his resignation Mir. Smith proudly
withdrew and took the train for Cleveland,
where he had an engagement with Mark
Hanna. .
Fismo Highwaymen Caught.
SAN LUIB OBISPO, Cal., March 22.â
Marshal J. W. Cook landed in the County
Jail late last evening two men, charged
with attempted highway robbery. They
had held up a Chinaman giving bis name
as Linn Han, near Pismo yesterday after
noon. News of the hold-up and a descrip
tion of the men was telephoned to this
city, and the officers left for the scene of
robbery, met the men on their way to San
Luis and took them in. The men gave
their names as John and George Riley
from San Diego.
COULTEKVILLE MINES ACTIVE.
Groundless Humor that the Merced Com-
pany Had Closed Down.
MARIPOSA, Cal., March 22.â The ex
citing topic in this county at present is the
reported closing down of the Merced Gold
Mining Company's extensive works at
Coulterville. The rumor has been scat
tered broadcast all over the State. There
is not a word of truth in it. The Merced
Gazette Bays :
The Merced Gold Mining Company in the
course of thetr operations have found it neces
sary to lay off some of their men at the Mary
Harrison and Louisa mines. Sonje of the
calamity howlers immediately started out
to circulate rumors that the bottom
had fallen out of the camp. Such alarmist
croaking is childish and the man who takes
stock in it is a fool.
The men were not "paid off," they were "laid
off," though if any man wanted his money, of
course he could go to the company's office
and get it at any time. The mill at the Potosi
is running steadily i>nd wonting beautifully.
The Merced Gold Mining Company's operations
are no guesswork combination. Step by step it
has gone on for a long time past. Before the
expensive machinery now on the ground was
put in position the management satisfied itself
that it aad the right stuff to work on.
Any sensible person who thinks for a minute
will realize that a great concern conducted on
the best known principles of modern science
is not going to collapse after running Its ma
chinery for a few days only. The Merced com
pany may be entirely trusted from past ex
perience to run its business to the best ad

EVA BOOTH IN CHICAGO
Makes Three Addresses at the
Headquarters of the
Salvationists.
The Large Building Filled to Over
flowing â Pleased to Find but
Few Deserters.
1 CHICAGO, 111., March 22.âCommis
sioner Eva Booth, temporaryjcommander
of the Salvation Army, delivered three
speeches of an hour's duration each at
army headquarters to-day. In her after
noon address only was any mention made
to the discord in the army ranks. This
afternoon she said she had been asked to
make a statement, but had nothing to add
to what had already been said by her
father, General Booth. Over twenty com
manding officers, she said, were trans
ferred at the time that of Ballington Booth
was ordered. Of this number five were of
the Booth family and she was one of the
five. The transfers were |made only in ac
cordance with the policy of the array that
no commander remain in any one terri
tory over five years at a time.
The Chicago headquarters of the army
seats about 2200 people and it was filled to
overflowing at each of to-day's meetings.
About half of those present were "sol
diers," and of the army workers perhaps
200 wore white ribbons, showing their pro
test against the removal of Ballington
Booth. At all three meetings Eva Booth
hanuled her audience so skillfully that
none of the many questions which had
been arranged for her by prospective
seceders were propounded. There was no
open display of hostility whatever.
One leader of tbe white-ribbon crowd
to-night stated that Ballington Bootn
would be in Chicago within a week and
sneak in some very large hall, that no de
finite action would be taken by his sympa
thizers until his arrival, but when he came
nearly half of the 2000 soldiers in Chicago
would be ready to fight under the new
colors.
Eva Booth declares that the number of
people who will leave the regular army is
exceedingly small. She said to-night:
'â¢There is much less trouble in Chicago
than I expected to find. As this is a place
where Ballington Booth is especially in
fluential, I expected to find many deser
tions; but lam pleased to find there are
but few. The trouble will amount to lit
tle. A few of. the weak ones will leave,
but the number will not be large enough
to affect us materially. There are always
disturbers looking for just such an oppor
tunity, and there are some in the Chicago
barracks; but, as I paid, I am glad to find
the number is small."
At to-night's meeting the commissioner
dwelt long on man's love of power, follow
ing it with the fact that no one has cower
over death. It was thought by many that
the speaker was making indirect thrusts at
the ex-commander, but nothing was said
that could be so considered.
COLOAML EADIE'S RECALL.
A Step That May Lend to a Reconcilia
tion of the Booth:
NEW YORK, N. V., March 22. -The first
step in a plan to effect a reconciliation be
tween Ballington Booth and the leaders of
the Salvation Army has been taken by
General William Booth, who has ordered
Colonel Eadie to "farewell" and return to
London.
In obedience to the general's orders
Colonel Eadie to-day began his "farewell"
services. He spoke in the afternoon in
the Bowery barracks and in the evening in
Memorial Ball at the National headquar
ters, but at neither meeting did he refer to
his recall. He seemed surprised when
questioned about the general's message,
but while he would not confirm the re
porter's information that he had received
it neither would he deny it.
Colonel Eadie is blamed for the troubles
in the army, because it is said it was his
machinations against Commander Balling
ton Booth that stirred up opposition to
his sou in the general's mind. ,
TAKEN FROM JAIL
AT MIDNIGHT
A Tennessee Murderer Is
Dragged to His
Doom.
THE MOB WOKE MASKS
They Worked So Noiselessly
That the Villagers Were
Not Aroused.
VANISHED LIKE PHANTOMS.
Not a Word Spoken and the Man
Given No Opportunity
to Confess.
CHATTANOOGA, Term., March 22.â A
mob of thirty determined men took
William Muipby from the Scott County
jail at Huntsville, Term., at midnight last
night by a stratagem and hanged him,
pleading and praying, to a locust tree in
the public square not 100 feet from the
jail.
i'be victim was in prison awaiting trial
for shooting Bill Bowlin, a miner at
Pioneer, three weeks ago. The Circuit
Court was in progress at the time, but
Murphy's case had not been reached. The
lynches, with the exception of the leader,
who was unknown to the officers, wore
handKerchiefs about the lower part of their
faces. The "unknown" rapped the jailer
out of bed with the declaration that he
was a certain Deputy Sheriff with a
prisoner.
A gun was thrust in Jailer Ellis' face as
he opened the doors and his keys were de
manded. He refused to produce them,
but his daughter, who appeared in the
office, was frightened into producing them
by seeing a dozen guns leveled at her.
The mob did their work so noiselessly
that the villagers were not apprised of the
bloody deed until this morning, when
they beheld a ghastly sight at their very
doors. The helpless wretch was dragged
out of his cell, praying continually and
pleading with his grim executioners for
his life. He asked them not to choke him
to death. Not a word was spoken, and
the murderer was given no opportunity to
make a confession of the crime he com
mitted, as it was seen by several personal
witnesses. The lynchers, who are un
known, disappeared like shadows after the
lynching.

choice, with a score of 22; Vaughn third,
score 21.

and the liveliest interest was manifested
in the preparations for the start. The as
sociation is trying to pick a crew to contest
for the coast championship. f
Shortly before 2:30 o'clock the crews
were in position and John E. Budd gave
the word to go. The giants and middle
weights shot a little ahead of the midgets
at the first dip of the oars, and they main
tained tlie advantage even after the turn
at the west point on the course below the
warehouses.
The crews in the lead had to strike hard
and often, however, to keep their positions,
as the midget oars dashed spray over the
sterns of both. On the down dash the
giant crew's craft kept its bow less th in
half a length in the lead of the midgets,
whose oars moved like clockwork, ana
with long and steady pulls.
The return was very exciting, as it was
evident that the midgets were trying to
make a good spurt for first place. Neither
crew had changed its position materially
when the finish was made. It was a nomi
nal victory for the giants; the midgets'
bow was almost to the line at the end, and
the middle-weights were not far behind.
No official time was Kept, but the time-
Keepers had it that the crews covered the
mile course in 5 :50.
ENDED HIS LIFE.
Tragic End of Jay Gordon in a Kearny-
Street Hotel.
A man known by the name of Jay Gor
don committed suicide in the washroom
of the New Western Hotel, Kearny and
Washington streets, by shooting himself
in the head at an early hour this morning.
He had evidently stood in front of the
looking-glass when firing the fatal shot.
At 1:15 o'clock a hackdriver entered the
washroom and found Gordon lying in a
big pool of blood with his revolver by his
side. This was the first known of the
affair. No one heard the shot, as the room
is in the basement of the building.
Frank Sieere, the night cleric, stated
that Gordon arrived at the hotel without
any baegage on March 12, and seemed to
have sufficient money for his imraeUiate
wants. He manifested some reticence
about giving his name, and never signed
the register.
Mr. Steere said that Gordon seemed to
be unable to sleep and frequently spent
the entire night sitting in the office"
He did so on Saturday night and re
marked that he wanted to keep up lone
enough to get thoroughly tired so he could
sleep!
The unfortunate fellow died fifteen min
utes after he was found on the floor. He
was about 42 years of age, tall and slim.
He dressed neatly, but not extravagantly.
THREE MEN IN THE TANK.
Pinkerton's Mysterious Prisoners
Held in Secret Durance
in This City.
The Trio Were Involved in a Bond
Deal in the Eastâ A Trunk
Capture.
The vast net manipulated by Pinker
ton's Detective Agency has been cast
abroad and as a result three men have been
arrested in this City and hidden away in
the "tanks" at the Central station.
Much mystery was maintained as to the
identity of the captives, but finally it leaked
out that their names were B. B. Lee, Wil
liam Rogers and J. Holmes.
Captain Lees was in profound consulta
tion with Pinkerton officials during the
day, but declined to state the exact char
acter of the crime for which the men were
held.
It was understood that Lee's wife for
merly stopped at a lodging-house at 824
Kearny street and that Holmes was
formerly a saloon-Keeper on Stockton
street. He was arrested Saturday.
It seems that Lee, who resided at 518
Geary street, was formerly a physician.
The story is that tne three men were
involved in a fraudulent bond transaction
in the East. When' the bonds were sent
here to be collected it was discovered that
the bonds were fraudulent. Evidences of
fraud were reported to have been found in
a trunk, which has been secured.
Stockbroker W. E. Jones is said to have
furnished some valuable information lead
ing to the capture of the men.

GREATER LOS F.T.F.S.
Voters Decide in Favor of the Annexation
of Suburban Districts.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., March 22.â 8y
the verdict rendered at the polls yesterday
Greater Los Angeles becomes assured; ten
square miles of territory are added to the
city and the population is increased about
12,000 souls at one "fell swoop." The ter
ritory annexed embraces the flourishing
suburbs ot Vernon, Rosedale and Pico j
Heights, bordering on the southern and
western boundaries of the city, as at pres
ent constituted.
The rich Harper tract, the most aris
tocratic residence section adjacent to the
city, comes in with Rosedale. At least
$3,000,000 will be added to the city assess- '
ment roll by the annexation.
; Highland Park and Garyanza, northern
'suburbs, were annexed several months
ago. adding about 3000 to the population of
the city. ThÂ» southern and western
suburbs were voted upon at the same time, :
but the proposition was defeated, v >"
The annexationists were not satisfied I
with this result, and succeeded in getting ;
sufficient petitioners to bring about a new |
'election, which took place yesterday, with
the result that toe proposition carried, and j
the whole territory voted upon will be an- i
nexed" some time in /April. In the city j
proper little interest was taken in the elec- I
tion, few voters taking the trouble to go to
the. dolls. ...
' ' Sentiment was overwhelmingly in favor
ot "annexation. The total vote in the nine :
city wards was 633 for to 192 against.
â¢ ( fn the suburbs to be annexed the fight
was hot and . close, many property-holders
opposing annexation on account of in- j
creased taxation. The saloon men tooK a
hand in the light also, and' opposed an
nexation on account of being compelled to
pay city as well as county license if an- !
nexed. There were lively scenes around I
the polls and a few lights, but no serious |
disorder occurred. â¢;
Pico Hei?hts, which a few months ago j
voted against annexation, gave a decisive
majority for it this time, the vote being
149 for to 117 against. Rosedale

night as Harry Burt, who, last September,

Bart became foreman of the Hershy
warehouse during that month, in place of
Frank Gastigif, and a few days after be
ginning work went to his predecessor and
asked him to sign a blank receipt, as he
wished to give it to Mrs. Langenour, as
she was not satisfied with the one she held
for her grain. The former foreman signed
his name, and Burt filled it out to a ficti
tious person and a few days later sold it
to Netherscott. He made good hia escape,
and was heard of in similar transactions
all over the coast. He came up from San
Francisco on Saturday, and, as he was
well known here, the officers promptly ar
rested him. He will be taken to Wood

SULLIVAN AT ASTORIA.
Caused a Stampede En Route to the North
by Throwing Ryan's Hat Over
the Steamer's Rail.
ASTORIA, Ob., March 22.â The steamer
Queen arrived this morning from San
Francisco with John L. Sullivan on board.
As soon as the vessel made fast a rumor
was circulated that Sullivan had been on
one of his sprees during the trip and had
attempted to take possession of the Queen.
This proved untrue, although at one time
the report was spread through the vessel
that Sullivan was drunk and was doing
those things which it is customary to see
in print about him. Women ran to their
staterooms and locked the doors, while
men fled to keep out of sight.
The trouble was, Sullivan threw Paddy
Ryan's silk hat overboard in a spirit of
levity, and no row was ever intended or
anticipated.
Shortly before the steamer left San Fran
cisco Sullivan thought that the silk hat
Ryan wore did not have that exquisite
gloss on it that it should have, so he
bought Paddy a new one. The first day
out Ryan appeared on deck with his old
silk Hat. Sullivan walked up to him, took
it off and threw it overboard, saying:
"The only way to get that new hat on
your head is to throw this overboard."
The passengers thought that it was in
tended ao an insult and the great nsticnff
champions were about to battle to the
death. An outcry was raised and was fol
lowed by a stampede.
CURING PORTLAND'S SICK
Putnam, the "Healer," Besieged
by Invalids Who Would
Be Made Well.
He Claims That the Method He Pur
sues Is One of the Lost Arts
of the Ancients.
PORTLAND, Or., March 22.â "Divine
Healer" Putnam is being overrun at his
rooms at 335 Alder street with all manner
of patients from this city and from the
country. Yesterday alone he had more
than 100 callers, and this forenoon he
scarcely had n breathing spell. In answer
to an inouiry as to whether he had effected
any cures since coming here, he remarked
that he had.
"I never speak of what I have accom
plished," said he, "but I prefer to have
those whom I have benefited speak for
me. There is not an honest man or woman
having called on me who will not indorse
the methods of the House of Truth in
curing the ills of body and soul."
To another question he replied that the
method of the House of Truth was in
vrgue 300 years after the resurrection, but
that the science was lost when the
churches looked more to temporal power
than to the spiritual good.
"I aui overwhelmed with correspondence
irom the interior since coming here,"
added Mr. Putnam, "asking me whether I
would advise the writers to visit me. I
have invariably replied that they should
come only when inspired by fait i to do so,
and not otherwise. Still a considerable
number have come and they may tell if
they wish whether or not their trip has
been in vain."
David S. Thompson, another disciple of
the House of Truth, came up from San
Francisco this morning to assist Putnam.
Thompson is an intelligent man and an
agreeable talker. It is his purpose to de
liver a few free lectures upon mind-train
ing and the correct way of thinking,
which is the underlying principle of the
method pursued by the House of Truth
healers. Putnam was asked as to whether
he had always been a good Christian, ac
cording to his interpretation of i.'ie term.
"No, sir," replied he. "I was a gilt
edged sinner at one time, till I reached the
end of the rope. I was almost a physical
and mental wreck, when I was inspired to
go to the House of Truth for pln'sical and
spiritual treatment. Upon my" recovery
I resolved to direct the rest of my life in
doing something for God and man, and in
this career lam happy. I look not to the
morrow for anything. I wish for no
riches in a worldly sense, for the good I
am able to accomplish by my faith is suf
ficient for me."
HERO OF LONG BEACH
Lindsley Stone's Bravery to Be
Brought to Mr. Cleveland's
Attention.
Daring Work at a Wreck After
His Discharge From a Life-
Saving Crew.
PORTLAND, Ob., March 22.â The case
of Lindsley Stone, the y\>ung man of Il
waco, Wash., who distinguished himself
by his brave and daring work at life-sav
ing in the storm off the Washington Coast
on February 28, when the steamer Point
Loma went down near Long Beach Coast
resort, will probably be called to the at
tention of President Cleveland. This will
not be done because of his bravery alone,
but because he stands suspended from the
life-saving service and was in disgrace at
the time of the Point Loma wreck.
Stone has been a respected citizen of ll
waco for a number of years and has held
a position at the Cape Disappointment
Life-saving Station for three years.
Some time ago, when he had been mar
ried but a few weeks', Stone left his post of
duty at the station one night to visit his
young wife across the bay. He was re
ported and the superintendent of the life
saving service discharged him in disgrace.
In the wreck of the Point Lonia, Stone
volunteered his services and undertook
the most dangerous work. He was com
mended for "doing most magnificent ser
vice in rescuing the crew," and the towns
of Long Beach and Ilwaco are still talking
of the wort of Stone on that eventful day.
Captain Conroy of the lost steamer has
sent a special petition to the superintend
ent of the life-saving service for the young
man's reinstatement, and should it be
come necessary a Congressman will carry
the case to the President.
Interred at. Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 22.â The
funeral of ex-Senator Thomas McDonald,
who has been for many years foreman of
the pressroom in the State printing office,
took place to-day. McDonald had the
respect and esteem of all who knew him,
and the printing office employes attended
the services in a body. The funeral
oration at the grave was an able one,
delivered by President H. W. Ogg of the
local Typographical Union.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 23, 1896,
VISALIA'S JAIL
UNDER GUARD
Fears of an Attempt to
Lynch Dan McCall's
Accomplices.
OFFICIALS ARE ALERT.
Lovren and Ardell Beg That
They Be Protected From
a Mob.
SHERIFF HERRITT'S CUNNING.
Arranged to Outwit the Intended
Robbers, Though Watched by
Their Tools.
VISALIA, Cal., March 22.â Although
the excitement following the attempted
robbery of a Southern Pacific tram near
LOVREN'S SALOON IN VISALIA.
[In this place the attempted train robbery, which ended in the killing of Outlaw Dan McCall and the wounding of two officers, iÂ» alleged to
have been planned. The man in shirtsleeves standing on a line with the corner of the building is Si Lovren.]
Tuiare, the shooting of Dan McCall and
the subsequent jailing of the outlaw's al
leged accomplices has died down some
what, local authorities are not relaxing in
their precaution to guard ihe jail against
any possibility of mob attacks. Deputies
are constantly on the watch, and more be
cause of their watchfulness than for any
other reason it is not believed any attempt
will be made to wreak summary justice
upon Lovren and Ardeli. The prisoners
are still alarmed and hare begged the
officials to save them from the people's
vengeance.
Sheriff Merritt set an example that
many other officers could profit by when
making arrangements to stop the men
who had planned to rob the Southern
Pacific overland near Tuiare. When he re
ceived the tip from Obi Britt that the
hold-up would take place last Wednesday
night be quietly informed his deputies to
be on hand at that time. On the da}' of
the attempted robbery Sheriff Merritt
drove a bunch of hogs to Tulare from his
ranch near that city.
He went about it just as quietly and with
as much unconcern as if it were an every
day affair. He had the hogs weighed and
corraled, and then went to tne railroad
office, presumably to waybill them, there
by throwing off any suspicion that Lovren
and Ardell's tools may have had. Every
man connected with the Sheriff's office
was watched that day by men who were in
the employ of the bandits, and their move
ments were reported promptly to Lovren
and his partner. It was necessary to notify
the Southern Pacific so that assistance
might be rendered by that corporation in
foiling the robbers.
Sheriff Merritt did another wise thing in
sending a trusted employe to Bakersfield
to have a personal interview with Super
intendent Burkhalter, instead of using the
wires. The company's special officer, O. J.
Meade, was notified to be in readiness for
train No. 20. When that officer arrived in
Tuiare he soon learned the mission he was
on.
The funeral of Dan McCall yesterday
and the fact that the Visalia jail holds
Lovren, Ardeli and their tools are the best
evidence of the success of Sheriff Merritt's
plans.
Charles Ardeli, the partner of Lovren in
the saloon and general law-breaking busi
ness, bas an interesting history. He is a
native of Georgia, about 29 years of age,
and is a brick mason by trade. He is 6
feet 2 inches in height, lightcomplexioned,
witn blue eyes and dark hair. About nine
years ago he accepted a position with a
circus company to make a tour of old Mex
ico, and his occupation was to sell lemon
ade, peanuts and reserved seats. After
leaving the show he landed in San Ber
nardino and went to work at his trade.
Subseouently he hired out to Walter Ma
ben, the trotting-horse man, who had
charge of L. J. Rose's Sunnyside ranch
near Los Angeles.
Ardeli worked there almost a year and
gained a local reputation ior being a "good
man around horses." He then traveled
through the circuit with Charles Durfee,
and Visalia was one of the towns which
he visited.
One year later Ardeli came back to Vi
salia. 8i Lovren took a liking to him and
offÂ«red him a position as barkeeper. Lov
ren, thinking there would be money in a
dancebouse, leased a piece of property a
short distance from the Sequoia mills in
Fresno County and induced Ardeli to in
vest in the businee-s. The land was owned
by a resident of Visalia and when Moore
& Smith (owners of the mill), heard of the
proposed dancehouse they tried to buy the
lease, but could not. The place did not
pay and Lovren and Ardeli "went broke."
The only time Ardeli was arrested here
was when Marshal Gilliam locked him up
for frequenting disorderly houses. He
was allowed to leave town the next day
and remained away for several months.
From the time of his arrest last Thursday
morning he has had nothing to say.
S. Josiah Lovren, or better known in
Visalia and the logging camps on the Pa
cific Slope as Si Lovren, was born in lowa
45 years ago. He is 5 feet 9 inches tall,
has a dark reddish complexion, brown
hair and hazel eyes. He came to the coast
when quite young. Lovren has the repu
tation of being the best logger that ever
worked around a coast logging camp. He
is a good teamster and drove a stage into
Boise and Carson when they were lively
places. He was working at the Truckee
mills when on the sth of July, 1886, his
brother, Westley, was shot by William
Banks, a waiter in the Visalia House. He
came to Visalia and worked awhile in the
mills, and afterward went into the saloon
business.
Lovren has been arrested several times for
"scrapping." In January, 1870, while in
a jealous fit, Si took a shot at a young man
for "stealing" his girl. He missed his
rival, but the bullet struck the girl in the
thigh. He was fined $200 for that the
next day, and the day following paid $50
more for carrying concealed weapons.
Lovren is nervous now, and wants the
Sheriff to keep a strong guard around the
jail, as he fears an attempt will be made
to hang him.
There is no question but there are oth
ers ihiplicated in the attempted robbery
who are not yet under arrest. The section
men from Goshen and Tulare were on the
scene shortly after daylight, and they
went over the ground carefully looking for
the six-shooter with which McCall shot
Under Sheriff Daegett. At 3:05 o'clock that
morning a rancher heard a team pass his
house going rapidly toward Visalia. Evi
dence continues to pile up against Lovren.
There is a man here whom Lovren asked
to buy the red cheesecloth used on Mc-
Call's lantern and portions of which was
found in McCall's cabin and in Lovren's
saloon.
There is no truth in the sensational
rumor that Obi Britt, who assisted In ex
posing and capturing the train-robbing
gang is a son of Detective Brighton of
Evans and Sontag fame. Britt says he
never heard of Brighton until he heard
the name talked about in the office of the
jail during the past few days.
Obie Britt requested that he be allowed
to see a representative of The Call this
afternoon to correct statements made in
other San Francisco dailies. Said he:
"1 came to Visalia from Texas on Octo
ber 8, and went to work the same day on
John A. Patterson's farm. I was there
until the latter part of January. There I
got acquainted with McCall. For some
time I never received a hint from him that
he was anything but an upright, honest
man. About two weeks ago he told me
that even-thing was arranged; that Ldvren
and Ardell had everything completed and
the prospect for a rich job was in sight.
McCall, Haines and myself never con
versed on the subject at the same time.
Sometimes McCall and Haines would talk
over the scheme. Haines and myself often
talked about it, but not as much as Dan
and me. I never spoke to Lovren and
Ardell and to no other person but Haines
and McCall. I understood that the men
in town would watch ibe movement of the
Sheriff's men.
Oq last Tuesday afternoonâ the day be
fore the robbery â Dan drove over to
Humes' place to talk with Haines and see
if he was still in the nioodto stand in on
the proposed robbery. On his return he
seemed to be put out, and said they did
not have an opportunity to talk. It was
not long before Haines drove up to our
cabin with giant powder. McCall and
he had a long talk. After Haines' de
parture Dau told me that Haines would
be on hand.
"That night Dan went to town and
brought out the shotgun with him.
Wednesday noon the two six-shooters
were brought out. Between 7 and 8 on
the evening of the attempted holdup, some
one brought out the rifle. Dan met them
in the field near the gate. Dan was over
joyed at the news he had heard â just
laughed and danced around. Then he be
came impatient and concluded that
Haines would never come.
"About ten minutes after 9 o'clock
McCall and I started to Goshen on foot.
We reached Goshen soon after 11 o'clock.
McCall hid behind a car till the Visalia
tram pulled in. I was standing at the
northeast corner coalyard..
"McCall saw some one cross the street
and he climbed over the coalyard fence to
be ready to shoot the person. He tlien
was only a few yards from me, and as he
was getting ready to shoot the man I raised
my gun and shot at him. The contents of
the gun passed near his head. McCall fell
to the ground, and tben exclaimed, 'My
God, man, what did you Jet your gun go
off accidentally for?' He jumped up and
we both ran down the Visalia track for a
short distance. Then he explained to me
that the flash bad burnt bis face.
"When the train arrived I told him there
was bis train. He climbed onto the blind
baggage, just back of the engine, expecting
me to follow. I did follow close behind
until he got aboard, but I never touched
the train. It pulled out at that moment
and I went back to the station and tele
graphed Sheriff Merritt at Tulare."
JUNIOR DAY
AT PALO ALTO
Class of '97 Preparing a
Number of Original
Features.
COMEDY BY AMATEURS.
"A Stanford Deal" the Farce to
Be Enacted in Encina
Gymnasium.
FRESHMEN LOOKING FORWARD
Already Receiving Bids for a Supply
of Sophomore Canesâ A Senior
Class Book.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY,CAL.,March
22.â The junior day has been set for April
17, and the various committees appointed
| by the class are working hard to introduce
I original features and to make the day a
complete success. The committee ap
pointed to receive the farces and to choose
one to be presented has, after careful de
liberation, selected out of the four sub
mitted that of J. M. Ross '97, entitled "A
Stanford Deal." Mr, Ross' farce deals
with college life in its humorous phases,
contains many local hits and is divided
into four acts. The plot is entirely original,
the farces of the previous classes having
hinged upon complications and incidents
of the junior "prom." This has been worn
somewhat threadbare, and new scenes and
new hits will be received with interest.
The whole day will be given to the
juniors, and they will make the most of it.
In the morning a game of baseball will be
played between a team of juniors and
freshmen and a team chosen from the
seniors and sophomores. The baseball
talent of the combined classes is nearly
equal, and an interesting game is ex
pected. The afternoon will be devoted to
the production of the farce in Encina,
which will be provided with a stage and
decorated for the occasion. In the even
ing the junior promenade will occupy the
attention of the Stanford world. Encina
Gymnasium will be decorated as tastefully
as art and money can accomplish. The
music will be an especially enjoyable fea
ture.
The Sequoia edition for junior day has
been turned over to the class of '97 by
Business Manager Switzer and Editor
Neidig. The editorship was accepted, but
Mr. Switzer will manage the financial
business. J. |H. Timmons '07, editor of
the Daily Palo Alto for last semester, has
been appointed editor-in-cnief, with power
to choose his associates and assistants.
The whole edition will be the work of
juniors. A special cover will be designed
and all the stoiies, poems and verses will
display the great literary ability which
abounds in the junior class. The art work
will be made an important part of the
iss"e.
The class of '99 is at present interested
in the selection of its sophomore canes. Al
though it is over two months before the
present sophomores will permit them to
carry them, a cane committee has been
appointed, composed of R. E. Filcher, F.
F. Rogers, T. T. C. Gregory, John Brun
ton and 0. C. Leiter (chairman), â whose
dut vitis to make the selection. Designs
and bids are being received from all the
leading firms of the country.
The ' 96 class, with its usual enterprise,
has decided to issue a senior-class book
which will occupy a distinctive field of its
own in the class publications. It will con
tain about fifty views of the campus, some
of which were taicen during the celebra
tion over Mrs. Stanford's victory. The
book will be printed in the class colors of
cardinal and straw gold. It will also con
tain individual pictures of the faculty
and of the senior class. The only literary
matter will be the class history and several
appropriate poems by members of the
class. It will be a work of art containing
no advertisements of any kind, which fact
accounts for its somewhat high price, as it
will cost $5 apiece.
The faculty of the law department has
decided to conduct a summer school in law
for six weeks at the university. J. N.
Hutchinsonof San Francisco will give a
course in pleading and evidence, and Pro
fessor Abbott of the university will lecture
on the special performance of contracts.
FRESSO CAXAL COMPAXT BVED.
liamaae* Aggregating Over $280,000
Demanded by a Flour Company.
FRESNO, Cal., Match 22.â The Sperry
Flour Company of this city has brought
suit against the Fresno Canal and Irriga
tion Company for damages aggregating
more than $250,000. This mill was former
ly operated by water power which was
furnished by tne canal company under
contract. In 1891 the city of Fresno de
stroyed the canal through the city, claim
ing it was a nuisance, and thus cut off
water from the mill. Since then steam
has been used in the mill at an additional
expense of $90 per day.
The complaint alleges that the canal
company induced the city to fill the
canal and leaves the inference that it
was done to get rid of a bad contract to
furnish water to the mill. The steam in
creased the cost of making Hour 21 cents a
barrel and thus rendered it impossible to
hold a large trade in Arizona and New
Mexico. For the loss of this trade $50,000
damages is asked. Damages other than
that are alleged to have aggregated
$200,000.
This canal formerly flowed down Fresno
street through the heart of tfce city.

Carlson of San Diego Says the Road Will
Jit Jtedeemed.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., March 22.â
The Nevada Southern Railroad was sold
for $306,208 by the Sheriff and unless the
sum is paid by April 10 the time for re
demption will have expired. Mayor Carl
son of San Diego is in the city on business
connected with the road. In a conversa
tion with a Call correspondent he said :
"The road will be redeemed. There is no
want of money, as the men associated
with me havÂ«s plenty and the road will be
pushed through to Utah."
Attorneys who have been looking up the
case say tnat Mayor Carlson has no right
to redeem; that the deed executed to
Mayor Carlson by J. E. Blake, the presi
dent of the Nevada Southern, was faulty,
as it was signed by the president only.
The company's seal and the secretary's
signature were not attached, nor is there
any evidence that the board of directors
authorized or ratified the sale.
NEWS OF MARE ISLAND.
Men at the Navy- Yard Pleased
at the Success of the
Monadnock.
Destination of the Bennington Still in
Doubtâ Reducing the Work
ing Force.
VALLEJO, Cal., March 22.â The gun
boat Bennington is back in these waters
after an absence of several months in trop
ical climes. After considerable repairing
and changes among officers and crew it
will be off again, whence no one can deter
mine. Even at Washington the Benning
ton's destination has not been decided
upon.
The stores for the Oregon are being laid
out. This indicates that the big warship
will come to the yard before many months.
The performance of the monitor Monad
nock on its trip to San Diego was excel
lent. Letters received show the monitor
to be a good sea boat and her engines are
all right. Chief Engineer Kutz made no
mistake in his declaration, after the trial
trip, that the Monodnock was a "bird."
Kutz gave the men in the engine and fire
rooms a $10 gold piece with which 10 buy
an oyster supper after they had tied the
Monadnock up at the wharf.
Cannon balls may be considered danger
ous, even if no great charge of nowder is
back of them. A lot of conderaed shot re
cently disposed of was lying on the wharf
a day or two ago awaiting shipment to San
Francisco to be melted over. One of the
steel or iron XI shot was rolled against
one of the workmen, breaking his ankle,
and he is now engaged in nursing the
broken bones.
The number of men at the yard has been
reduced to 600. If funds were available
there is plenty to do and many willing to
do the work. Repairs have been com
menced on the Mohican, but it will be
months before it flies a pennant. A few
machinists are overhauling the sea and out
board valves of the Baltimore. This work
is required every few months and does not
come within the estimate of repairs proper.
Workmen hero do not admire the report
of a high naval official at Washington
that the Secretary was not likely to give a
battle-ship to any more navy-yards to
build, as the experiment made in the East
failed to turn out as well as expected.
This cannot be said to be owing to any
fault of the men employed, who are mads
to suffer thereby, but it is the fault of the
designers. In the case of the battle-ship
Texas no fault has been found with the
workmanship.

TTCTORIA, B. C, March 20.â T0 any
one who reads the newspapers the name at
least of the capital city of British Columbia
has a familiar sound. Victoria gives to
the American public in many instances
the first particulars that are received of
whatever of importance is happening, not
alone within the great and constantly
growing province of British Columbia,
among the sealers or. in British North
Pacific naval circles, but also in China,
Japan, Australia, Hawaii and Alaska.
This being the case, it is only natural to
suppose that the American public is
interested in the city and, to a certain ex
tent, curious, no doubt, a3 to bow it has
won its commanding position as a news
and trade center, second to none but San

Victoria owes not only its birth, but
its growth in population, wealth and com
mercial importance. It has had no arti
ficial advantages; no railway crossing a
continent to give it life and commerce j no
brilliant picturing of the beauty of its loca
tion or the salubrity of its climate; no
world-wide advertising of the untold values
of the virgin mines aud forests in the tribu
tary country, or tbe wealth of its adjacent
waters are to be thanked by Victorians for
the importance that their city has thus far
attained in commerce or the attractions it
offers to people of wealth and refinement
in search of a delightful place of residence
or resort.
Fifty years ago, before immigration to
the shores of the Pacific was attracted by
the discovery of gold in California, Fort
Victoria had an existence. The gold
seekers were preceded by the fur-dealers,
and the first house in what is now the
queenly capital of British Columbia was
that of one of the adventurous traders of
the Hudson Bay Company. As years
rolled on the Importance of the post on
tbe southern extremity of Vancouver Is

royal navy which paid frequent visits to
the shores of Vancouver Island, more
gradually became a noticeable feature of
its society.
Then came the news of gold discoveries
in various parts of the country tributary
to the struggling settlement, and then the
influx of the army of the argonauts. From
California, where they had tasted the
bitter and the sweet of the gold fever, the
treasure-seekers with pick and shovel
poured into Victoria, equipped themselves
and passed on in hundreds and thousands
to the Frazer or to Cariboo. The history
of Victoria's life during the sixties is the
history of many places in the West which
gold finds have made famous in a day.
The mad search for riches made the
village a city, and one while tbe excite
ment was at its height of considerable popu
lation and constantly changing character.
After the fever came the reaction which
even more tried the young anc! struggling
city. Many of its citizens, however, knew
its worth, and Victoiia passed the crisis
safely, and commenced the steady, sub
stantial growth which has led to its recog
nition to-day as the wealthiest city, for its
size, upon the continent.
Located at the southern extremity of
Vancouver Island, the situation of Victo
ria is remarkable for its beauty and its
adaptability to the purposes of commerce.
The city rises gradually from the Straits
of San Juan de Fuea, and from the land
locked harbor in which its extensive ship
ping lies in safety. The grades from the
waterside through the business section to
the suburbs are all gentle, and no high
bluffs, alike dangerous and inconvenient,
mar any of the wide and well-kept streets.
The harbor ana shipping facilities cannot
be surpassed.
By the expenditure of hundreds of
thousands of dollars private enterprise has
constructed at the entrance to the harbor
proper docks, capable of accommodating;
and sheltering, in the roughest gale that
blows, the largest steamships and sailing
vessels to be found upon the waters of the
Pacific. Their course from the ocean is a
clear one, there being no dangerous and
tortuous channels and no shoala or rocks.
At this outer dock â for which R. P.
Rithet deserves the gratitude of Victo
rians â abundant water and excellent
wharfage is, afforded for shipping of any
draught. The shore line of Victoria har
bor, which is entirely protected by the nat
ural conformation of the land, is about
seven miles in length, good anchorage be
ing found in many places, while well-ap
pointed wharves extend for nearly a mile
or more in almost unbroken succession.
Here it is that dozens of steamers and sail
ing craft of all sizes are to be found at all
seasons of the year, receiving or discharg
ing freight.
Besides being a prosperous business cen
ter, Victoria is the health and pleasure
resort of the Pacific Coast north of Califor

ual glory and delight. It is on the line of
travel for all visitors to this part of the
â world. Splendid daily mail steamers bring
the Canadian transcontinental travelers
from the city of Vancouver, ttoe mainland
railway terminus, eighty miles tnrough
the picturesque scenery of the lsland
studded Gulf and Straits of Georgia.
At Victoria all the ocean lines focus.
From here to San Francisco one has the
choice of two routes â via steamer to Seat
tle or Tacoma on Puget Sound and thence
by rail, and by direct ocean-going vessel
from Victoria direct to the California
iretropolis. The Australian liners spend
several hours at the wharf here on both
inward and outward trips, and it is at
Victoria that they take on the numerous
passengers who come by the great rail
ways of the Northwestern United States
on "their way to enjoy the tropical delights
of Honolulu or the more extended trip to
the Australian colonies. The magnificent
vessels plying to China and Japan â the
one line run by the Canadian Pacific Rail
way Company, starting at Vancover, and
ottoers by the Northern Pacific and Great
Northern, lmm Tacoma and Portlandâ
likewise make Victoria their first port of
call inward and last of departure for the
Orient.

A railway line connects with Nanaimo
and Wellington, the center of the coal
industry, and another penetrates the
fertile Sanichjdistrict, having its terminus
also in this city. While all routes thus
lead to Victoria, no traveler ' past this
western gateway of the Dominion should
fail to arrange for a stay here.

by year more numerous id this city at the
gate of the straits, but were the charms of
this North Pacific resort fully understood
these visitors would be numbered by thou
sands instead of by hundreds as at present.
No Atlantic watering place presents equal
advantages with respect to the climate,
which in Victoria in the midsummer sea
son is absolutely unsurpassable, and if the
distance from the Eastern centers of popu
lation is great, compensation is found in
the interest and fascination of the journey
across the continant, and especially of the
trip through the mountains.
There need be no dull day in a stay of
several weeks in Victoria. Sea-batning
may be indulged in with perfect comfort
and safety from |the splendid beaches ad
joining the luxurious summer hotels.
Yachting in the straits or canoeing or row
ing in the ideally beautiful arm of the sea,
stretching three or four miles inland from
the inner harbor and known locally, as
"the gorge," are favorite pastimes. The
aquatic sports at Victoria on the 24th of
Mayâ Queen's Birthdayâ and other special
occasions are famed throughout the West
and attract annually thousands of visitors
from the adjoining States. The fishing en
thusiast not only may but commonly doeÃ
catch kingly salmon within a stone's
throw of the wharves at the entrance to the
harbor, and in the rivers and fresh- water
lakes adjoining the city a great variety of
sport is afforded.
Within easy distance, too, at the proper
season, the hunter can indulge at will in
the pleasures of the chase, tin ding besides
smaller game the panther, the bear and
the deer, the last named being astonish
ingly plentiful aud lordly in proportions.
Close to the city limits game-birds abound,
these including beautiful English pheas
ants, the golden and the silver ducks,
geese, grouse and quail, and others that
fall easy victims. The term "a sports
man's paradise" has a literal meaning
when applied to this island of Vancouver.
Casual visitors who come to spend only
a few days of course cannot indulge in the
variety of pastimes above indicated, but
for them a very enticing short programme
can be mapped out, and some of the most
notable sights may here be mentioned.
There is Esqnimalt, the harbor adjoin
ing that of Victoria, separated by a penin
sula and distant overland about four miles,
which distance a swift electric-tram service
reduces to a minimum. That harbor is the
headquarters of the Pacific fleet of the
British navy, and as her Majesty's officers
show great courtesy and afford every pos
sible opportunity for sightseeing to visit
ors, it is a most enjoyable as well as an in
structive experience to go aboard one of
the great men-of-war. The armament re
cently placed for the protection of this sta
tion at heavy expense, borne jointly by
the Imperial and Dominion Governments,
also lends additional interest to the local
ity. Every visitor to Esquimau inspects
the immense graving-dock maintained by
these two Governments and capable of
taking in the largest vessel plying on the
Pacific.
The Provincial Government buildings
and grounds occupying a delightful situa
tion overlooking victoria harbor are ob
jects of great general interest. There are
now nearing completion three massive
stone blocks of the most modern descrip
tion, to replace the modest brick struc
tures erected in the early days of the
colony and made to serve the purpose up
to the present. For the stranger particu
larly the most interesting of the provincial
institutions is the Geological and Natural
History Museum, where can be seen at a
glance the splendid types of wild animals
peculiar to the province and the variety of
birds and specimens of ferns and other
plant life. The mineral section, showing
samples of gold and silver ore from the
famous mines of British Columbia, is well
worth examination. A department of
special interest is that devoted to Indian
curiosities, which is well stocked with
quaintly-carved totem poles, images of
birds, beasts and men held sacred by the
mythology of Pacific Coast tribes; their
implements of warfare, of domestic use
and of ornamentation, and the strange
stories associated with these relics and il
lustrating the Indian beliefs would fill
many interesting volumes.
Beacon Hill Park is for land pastimes
andjjrecreation what the Gorge is for
aquatic pleasures, and for its natural
beauty is admired by everybody. In the
park proper Jart has been employed suc
cessfully in adding to the charm and pro
viding for the comfort of the frequenters,
who seemingly never tire of this lovely re
sort. In the miniature lakes stately swan
sail, and taught by experience that no
harm wiU happen them they come fear
lessly out to feed from the hand of the
visitors. Deer roaming in a snug inclo
sure; bears, coons and other fur-bearing
animals in pits or behind bars, and pea
cocks, ducks, pheasants, grouse, magpies,
owJs and other birds in cages, give an idea
of the animal and bird life of the province
and add greatly to the general interest.
Adjoining the park proper and overlook
ing the outer harbor is Beacon Hill, from
the summit of which a comprehensive
view of the beautifully varied surrounding
scenery is obtained, and on whose gently
sloping sides lacrosse, football, cricket,
baseball and other games are often carried
on simultaneously.each with its own assem
blage of spectators, without the least intei
ference one with the other, so well adapted
and spacious are the grounds.
On a Saturday afternoon especially the
scene is one of remarkable activity. Ex
cellent driveways have been constructed
winding about the hill up to the summit
and skirting the shore above the Straits of
Fuca. Another park splendidly situated
is at Cedar Hill, from which there is ob
tained a line birdaeye view of the city and
surrounding country â a veritable scene
from fairyland. From thia eminence and
from Beacon Hill one can look out at all
seasons upon the snow-capped peaks of
the Canadian arid United States mainland,
with Mount Baker, nearly 11,000 feet high,
majestically standing sentinel. This sight
on a bright midsummer day is a most re
freshing one.
The sunset effects and the constantly
changing panorama visible through the
long twilights of the summer months are
remarkably brilliant and worthy the skill
of the cleverest artist to attempt to re
produce. But no brusn could make a
faithful copy of the entrancing picture
which "Light, the first of painters,"
spreads each fine evening over Victoria
harbor.

The most important and interesting
event at the semi-monthly shoot of the
Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club yesterday
was a 100-shot match between Smitli Carr
and C. M. Daiss for a small trophy. The
shooting was on the new Colunioia target,
with the one center. These men are the
best pistol shots on the coast, and the fol
lowing scores of 10-shot strings show that
they bunched their shots within the 4)4
--inch circle:
C. M. Daissâ 49, 60, 51, 61, 41, 56, 37, 38, 52,

A. H. Pape, one of the best all-round
shots in the club, devoted all of his time to
shooting for prizes with the German
sharpshooters. He is the youngest of the
champion class shots in the State. He
won the all-round Siebe medal in 1894.
He has been shooting only a little over
two years, and went East with the Califor
nia team in 1895. His latest performance
with a rifle was to make scores of forty
four and forty-seven in a match on the Co
lumbia tar set.
A large number of marksmen attended
the prize bullseye shoot of the 3an Fran
cisco Schuetzen Verein. In this the cen
ter of interest lay in the contest for the
beautiful medal presented by Huber Bros,
of 620 Bush street. It was won by A.
Mocker, who on November 24 made the
best shot of the year, his bullet having
been within 103-1000 of an inch from the

SOUTH END BOAT RACE.
Three Four-Oared Barges Bow O?Â«f
a Three-Mile Course Yes
terday.
Three barge crews of the Sontli BnÂ£
Rowing Club pulled a friendly race
through the mist yesterday morning over
a three-mile course from the boathouse
and around the buoy off the sugar refinery.
They were the Seniors, the Invincibles and
the Defenders.
The Senior crew in the barge Charles N.
Felton was composed of Henry Bode, bow;
Bob McArthur, forward-waist and captain ;
Gus Carson, afterwaist; Frank Dnplissea,
stroke, and George McGrill, coxswain. The
Invincibles, in the barge "Fly Blister." were
Tim Barry, bow ; H. Smith, forward-waist ;
Dave Campbell, after-waist; George Bates,
stroke, and Thoma9 Guiifeather, coxswain.
The Defender crew, pulling in the South
Ends new racing barge, were Charles Cut
ler, stroke; James Faulus, after-waist;
Edward Scully, forward-waist; Edward
Tobin, bow, and Doc Flynu, coxswain.
The Seniors being the crack racing crew
tooK the barge Felton, that being the
slowest boat, to even up the content. The
Fly Blister is a paper-weight craft, so litht
that she was once blown off the wharf by
a South San Francisco zephyr. When she
was first turned over to the club she was
covered with paint-blisters and a waggish
rower christened her the "Fly Blister.' 7
At the start-away the Seniors plunged
ahead, taking the lead by a boat length,
the other boats pulling well together.
They all kept inshore to avoid the ebb
tide and turned the stake, the Felton lead
ing by almost two lengths, the new barge
las>t.
The stretch home was a strong tug of
war, the Blister trying her best to pu?h
her black nose past the head craft. But
the old boat beat her about a length and a
half, with the new barge several lengths
behind.
Tne Fly Blister's crew think that with a
little more practice they can overlap the
crack crew and a race between the two will
take place shortly.
The referee was Albert J. Fritz and the
judges William T. Humphrey, William
Thomas and Young Mitchell.
The South End professional crew, which
had itself taken out of tne amateur class a
year ago, is now seeking to return, as they
cannot find any racing competitors amoug
tt:e "profesh."

preparations for their entertainment and

Cut Off Baby's Fingers.
Mabel Ayecough, a child 18 months old, liv
ing with her parents at 371 Jessie street, had
two of her fingers of the left hand accidentally
amputated last evening. While playing near
her mother who was chopping kindling she
fell and put her hand on the choppinsr-bloelc
just as her mother brought the hatchet down
on a stick. The little one's fingers were sev
ered from the hand. The child was taken to

Don't Know Just What They'll
Do in the Matter of the
Fair Will.
VAN E. PATERSON TO FIGHT.
His Clients' Interests Demand It, But !
They Have No Honey.
Hopes for Aid.
Ex-Judge Paterson, attorney for the
m;nor heirs under the earliest of the Fair
wills, in an interview yesterday annouaced
his determination to maintain his opposi- i
tion to the probate of the pencil will, no
matter what attitude the attorneys for
Charley Fair and the sisters might take.
This may not appear to be news, but it
is. For when Mr. Paterson made his pro
test before Judge Slack on Friday it was
not the irretrievable crossing of the Rubi
con that it may have seemed.
Mr. Paterson; is in a peculiar position, \
and George A. Knight says ''his eyes are i
even now turned invitingly to me."
The whole situation concerning the Fair i
estate is in a most interestingly compli- j
cated condition and offers an inviting op- I
portunity to some newspaper having the i
coupon habit to open a guessing contest. |
Delmas & Shortridge, who have precipi- j
tated the trouble in the interest of the
legatees of the pencil will, are said to have
things locked up in their safe in the
Crocker building that "puzzles the wise" j
of all the army that represents the other j
interests.
Charles Heggerty says so â says he has
heard so, and helieves it is true.
He does not say what the things are or
whether they were alive or not. He says, !
however, that the army of lawyers for the
Fair children are going to caucus to-day
or to-morrow and will determine whether
they are "for or agin" the pencil will.
The indications are that the lawyers
who were lately opposing each other over
the probate of the trust will have been
brought toeether by what they look upon
as a common danger and will unite in
their opposition 10 the probate of the Lev
ingston or pencil will. They do not admit |
this, to be sure, and interviews had with a
number of them yesterday brought out a
variety of rather divergent views.
"It is very unfortunate that Mr. Delmas
has made this move at this time," said
Mr. Heggerty, called away from his Sun
day dinner at the interesting juncture just
preceding the introduction of the Jast
course. "He has forced upon us the
necessity of declaring ourselves for or
against "the pencil will. I think it is un
fortunate for him. I must confess that we
are in a ticklish position. I cannot just
say what we will do. We will determine I
that to-morrow or next day. There are
features of the situation that cannot be
discussed in publ:c, but which are calcu- j
lated to influence our action. The other
side know what they are.
"There are documents locked up in tne
safe of Delmas & Shortridge that they
threaten to spring upon us. We want to
eet tne thing settledâ secured some way
against the crop of alleged widows and
orphan children that keeps growing and j
multiplying through every changing sea- !
son."
"I never liked that pencil will, you
know that," said George Knight. "I am
afraid this move of Mr. Delmas will force
us to line up with ex-Judge Paterson and !
figrt.t the probate of tiiat will. I can't say. j
â¢'l'll know more about it in a few days.
I may say, however, that my client really
fares better under the pencil will than
the other. But I wanted to get this matter
settled up and out of litipation. That is
why I dismissed the contest in the other.
What is new in politics?"
Another of the counsel for Charley Fair
and the sisiers said: 'This- is the situa- j
tion â you want to know it from the posi
tion of a man up a tree, don't you? Well,
the court has declared that the trust
clause in the trust will, the one the chil
dren were contesting, will not noldâ has
knocked that clause out. That clause is i
all the children objected to.
"With that clause knocked out there is I
really no material difference between the
two wills. The first will leaves $500,000 to
charities, and the income of the estate, '
which is held in trnstfor the children, and j
after their death the estate proper is to be
divided among their childrenâ the grand- i
children. With the trust knocked out, the j
charity bequests are the same, and the j
children get the estate at once. Under
the pencil will there are some few thousand !
dollars' difference in the charity and other j
bequests â scarcely wortn mentioning â ard i
the body of the estate goes to the children I
at once.
"So I see nothing for us, who represent \
the children, #to do but wait and watch, j
Under the earlier will the trustees were
Angus, Crothers, Goodfellow and Bresse. â 
Under the second the executors are An- {
gus, Crothers and Marc Levingston. If
you were an heir would it matter to you i
which of these got the fees. In the one i
Levingston is substituted for Goodfellow
and Bresse, but that would not worry you
much, would it? Well, as much may be
paid for us. No. we are in a rocking chair,
equally comfortable whichever way it
rides.
"As for Mr. Paterson, who represents i
minor children of the brothers and other
relatives of Mr. Fair, his interest amounts
to a few thousand dollars more under the
trust will than under the pencil will. But
his interest is wholly dependent on the
trust clause which the Superior Court has !
knocked out. He will, of course, look care- i
fully after the interests of his clients. Judge j
Paterson's name stands for that. To my j
view, however, Herman Oelrichs Jr. has
no standing in court in any case. As I have i
said, I cannot say that it is any of our !
affair to interfere."
Ex- Judge Paterson said this: "I am a
little puzzled what to do. My childrenâ
my clients have no money. I have no no
tion of what assistance I will get from the
three heirs, if any. I wish I did. Mr.
Delmas, in admitting my right to approve !
the probate, secures his jury. That is i
what he wanted. My objectfon to a jury :
is the great expense that attaches. As I j
have said, my children have no money. If j
Marc Levingston secures the probate of j
the pencil will, then he has the funds of ' ,
the estate to draw from to right any other j
opposition, and the sinews of war are {
everything in a matter of this kind. |
â¢That must be prevented. You may j
pay that I will light. The interests of my i
clients demand that of me and it will be a
long and bitterly contested fight. I fully
appreciate the great interests at stake on :
the other side. But our interests are even
grrater, for under the pencil will we get j
nothing. Under the trust will the whole ]
estate ultimately comes to us." â¢
Mr. Deimas for the Levingston or pencil '
will said: "We have undertaken to secure I
ihe recognition an.l probate of the pencil I
will, which we believe to be the last will
and testament of Mr. Fair. The matter is i
before the court. It will come ud next
Friday ard will then be set for trial, prob- |
ably to a day certain. I cannot see that j
there is anything more to be said."

ALAMEDA GIVES SUPPORT
No Financial Aid Askedâ Are
Prepared to Maintain
the Needy.
CAUSE OF GENERAL STRIKE-
Concession by Association, by United
Shops, or Demand by Paint-
Dealers.
Nearly 1500 journeymen painters in this
City are Dot at work, and their rapidly
perfected strike shows a stronger front
daily.
To-day about forty more painters will
be initiated into the union. The number j
of non-union painters at work in the City !
is so insignificant that the strikers declare
and are confident that they control the
situation.
M. A. Roberts, spcretary of the Alameda
County Federated Trades, called at head
quarters in the Temple last night and
pledged his vote and the moral and finan
cial support of the organization he repre
sented to stand by the striking painters of
', San Francisco. He declared that the sen
; timent in Alameda is that the painters are
j in the right, and are not asking any unjust
demands.
The great majority of other labor trades
in this City have, with a very few excep
tions, sent messages of sympathy to the
â  union men on strike and have guaranteed
financial aid if it become necessary. The
bricklayers, the plumbers, the cornice
makers are all union men and are sympa-
I tbetic although they are not in the Build
ing Trades Council.
So far tne strikers have asked no finan
cial aid either or other unions or of the
public. On the contrary they are inde
pendent. "If necessary,'"' explained one of
the men last night, "we are prepared to
rent a house, furnish it, and lodge and
board the needy on strike, and we have
funds to do it."
To-night tbe painters will hold a meet
ing and attempt to arrive at a final line of
action to bring tbe strike to an end. But
there is no talk o? a compromise.
Their fear is that if the strike continues
much longer it will spread to neighboring
towns beyond the power of anything to
prevent it. And i it holds until the first
week in April the painters think tbat
fully 15,000 men will be out of employ
ment through the extension of the inter
linked trades unions acting in sympathy
with the original movers.
"The striKe could be settled," said Al
bert Falen, "in one of three ways: First â
by the Master Painters' Association acced
ing to our demands; second â by the shops
outside of the Association and represent
ing a much larger nuiuberof master paint
ers forming an organization and acceding
to our demand: third â by the wholesale
paint dealers inviting anddomanding that
the master painters accede to the journey
man painters' demands."
There are two propositions mooted for
to-night's meeting: Shall tue journeymen
painters form a co-operative union ami go
into active competition with the so-called i
master painters? Or shall they go back to I
those master painters who, having ac- j
ceded to their demands, will agree not to i
sublet contracts to nor take them from the '
objectionable master painters?
"The real reason why we called the gen
eral strike," explained K. T. Mclvor, the
business .igent of the strikers, "was be- i
cause we found that some employers who
bad acceded to our demands were actually !
helping out other employers who were
opposed to us. The only way was to clean I
up the whole market.
"My private opinion is that the best â 
way out of the strike is for the painters to j
go bacK to the employers that are willing ;
to do the right thing and t:icn to continue
tbe war against the unfavorable em
ployers."
The strike is virtually in the hands of
the Labor Council, althougn the l'ainters'
Union has the right to settle its own
affairs. But the principle is one mat af
fects all the buildins: trades; it is the card i
system. Each unioD man carries his ere- !
dentials on a card an<i he refuses to work !
on a job on which a non-union man is em- i
ployed. By the extension of the principle I
union carpenters, for instance, would dis- !
continue work on a building if a non- !
union painter were employeu tiiere and i
refused to accept an application to join the ;
Painters' Union.
The great fiprhi is against what is known j
as the Master Painters' Association of the i
Pacific Coast, the only organization of em- \
plovers of journeymen pninters. But the '
strikers assert that the oestand most re- i
sponsible firms of the city do not belong to !
the association. Furthermore they say j
they will admit that thf> association com- !
prises forty linns in the City, but they de- j
clare that there are 150 shops not in the I
association and among them the best pay
ing and largest concerns in town.

the highest wages, and without any com
pulsion.
It is believed by some of the strikers that
favorable arrangements can be made with
the great majority of the master painters,
and then a freeze-out game can be begun
against the Master Painters' Association.
As there has been a call for work in out
side towns the strikers have supplied the
demand from their number. Because of
the small amount of painting done in neigh
boring towns Jast year the prospects are
good for this season. '

The remodeling of the Langham Hotel,
| at the corner of Mason and Ellis streets,
i which has been in progress for eight
I months past, is completed, and it is now
, the best arranged hotel in the State. One
' feature of the reconstructed house is the
I office. The woodwork is of oak, highly
! polished; the floor is of marble, and the
j walls and ceilings are beautifully designed
| and are frescoed in buff and gold. Over
| the handsome plate-glass bay-windows in
' the front of the office is a pretty conserva
j tory. The private entrance to the left of
the office is finished in the same style as
the latter. From a large lobby in the rear
of the office rive flights of broad stairs
and a new Crane electric elevator give
j access to the upper floors. The house has
! been refurnished throughout and all the
1 appointments are first-class in every par
'â¢ ticular. There are some twelve beautiful
1 suites with baths attached, and there are
| numerous other suites and single rooms as
, well. On the first floor is a lavatory and
; baths with porcelain tuba, finished in
marUe and hardwood. On each of the
other floors are separate lavatories for la
| dies and gentlemen, each containing two
: porcelain bathtubs. The exterior of the

MOURNING THEIR DEAD
Kind Words From Theosophists
About William Q.
Judge.
HE WAS AN ABLE LEADER.
His Host Likely Successor Is Said to
Be Dr. J. D. Buck of
Cincinnati.
Theosopbists from nearly erery part of
this State joined their brothers and sisters
of the local organization last nLht at a
meeting field in Red Men's Hall on Post
street. They had assembled to comfort
one another in their sadness over the
death of their president, leader and friend,
William Q. Judge.
Dr. Jerome A. Anderson, president of
the local society and a member of the
National executive board, stated the ob
ject of the assemblage. Subsequently he
called upon a number of brothers and sis
ters, residents of distant cities, to make
brief addresses. Those who responded
were:
Mrs. Russell of Santa Cruz, who related
an incident of the persistency of William
Q. Judge in advocating theosophy. She
told how for weeks tne great man held
meetings in a hall he hired for that pur
pose, it made no difference to him
whether or not he had an audience.
Finally one day a newspaper reporter
heard of this peculiar man, who talked to
a house full of empty chairs, and he went
there to report the ecture. After that Mr.
Judge nevr r lacked a large audience.
Thomas Slattr spoke at length on the
subject of Mr. Judge's writings.
Dr. Campbell of Santa Cruz told of inci
dents in Mr. Judges life, showing his
great goodness of heart.
Mrs. Dr. Patterson of San Diego and
Mrs. Morc'ie If. Thirds also spoke briefly.
The on* point which came out in all the
addresses was, "Who is to 'succeed the
dead leader?"
This, some of the speakers averred, was
the inquiry when Mme. Blavatsky died.
The answer was not long in coming, for
William Q. Judge was on hand to grasp
the reins.
Dr. J. 1). Buck of Cincinnati will, it is
thought, undoubtedly become the presi
dent. Both he and Mr. Judge were in this
City at the time of the Midwinter Fair in
attendance upon the congress of religions,
before which both spoke.
J. D. Buck M.D., is about 55 years old.
For many years ne was dean of the Pulte
Medical "College of Cincinnati. He has
been connected with tne Theosophical So
ciety since its earliest days.
He is a large and broad man. physically
as well as mentally. He is a genial, wnole
souled, erudite and able leader. He is
the author of "A Study of Man," "Chris
tos" anil a number of psimnhlets. Unani
mously elected vice-president of the So
ciety of Theosophists in America he had
full knowledge of the probability that he
would some day have to assume the
leadership at the death of William Q.
Judge. He was trusted by Mme. H. Â±\
Blavatsky and the entire society. At one
time he represented the society at the
world's parliament at Chicago and at the
Congress held in this City.
In speaking of William Q. Judge last
evening Dr. Jerome A. Anderson said:
"William Q. Judge was born in Dublin,
Ireland, April 13, ISSI, and was the son of
Frederick ii. Judge and Alice Mary Quan.
"His childhood was spent in his native
city, but when he was 13 years of age, his
mother having died, the family moved to
the United Stat n s, arriving in" New YorK
in 1864 on the City of Limerick.
"At the age of seven he suffered a terri
ble illness, which caused a remarkable
change in his whole being, and his parents
found it necessary to stnay theciiildanew.
During convalescence he manifested a
peculiar aptitude lor learn inc. and as early
as his eighth year began to show deep in
terest in religion, magic, Rosicrucianism
and the book of reve.ations.
"Subsequenily he became a great reader
of books on mesmerism, on phrenology
and on character reading.
"Shortly after arriving in America ne be
gan his first employment as a clerk. Then
he entered the law office of George P.
Andrews, afterward Judge of the Supreme
Court of N<;w York.
"On coming of age, in 1872, he was natur
alized and wuhin a month thereafter was
admitted to the bar. He attained success
in his profession-, particularly in commer
cial law, which was his specialty.
"In 1874 Elia M. Smith of Brooklyn be
came his wife, and she now survives him.
"When, in 1875, the whole world was at
tracted to the subject of "spirif'-rappings
he met Mine. H. P. Blavatsky, and to
gether with her and Colonel Olcott founded
the Thcosophic Society. After the depart
ure of his co-founders for India he assumed
the leadership of the society in America,
and later, when it was organized into a
section, he became its general secretary.
"For many years he was the mainstay of
the society, intellectually and financially,
and devoted all the proceeds of a very
large legal practice to the woric, the result
being that be died a poor man.
"Four years ago, wnen the society had
by a phenomenal growth attained such
size that Mr. Judge found it necessary to
devote all his time to it, he abandoned his
profession in order to do so.
"A year ago there was a division in the
original society, and the entire American
section and parts oi other sections formed
an independent body, united by the prin
ciple long championed by Judge, who was
elected president first of the American
branch and afterward of the Theosophic
Society in England and in Australia.
"A quiet, unassuming man, his chief
power lay in his ethical teachings. He
was a tireless worker, devoting in later
years his days and large parts of his nights
to his profession and to his writing and
study. His death resulted Ironi consump
tion, aggravated by overwork.
â¢'His first writings, published anony
mously with the title, 'Letters That
Have Helped Me,' were considered by
almost every one in the society, whether
tnenuly to him or not, as the work of an
adept. Other published works of his are,
'F.cnoes From the Orient' and 'The
Ocean of Theosophy.'
"During the lust ten years he wrote
almost innumerable magazine articles,
published principally in the Magazine oi
Theosophy. which at times was nearly
rilled with his contributions under differ
ent pseudonyms."
Tui-re are between 4000 and 5000 Theoso
phists in this country. The avowed ob
jects of the society are first to form the
nucleus of a brotherhood of mankind.
This in the oiiiy object to which students

THE YOUTHFUL ROBBERS
Chicken Pacheco, Aged n, Tells
How They Broke Into
the Grocery.
LIKE HABDENED CRIMINALS.
They Stole $io and Were Arrested
by Sergeant Hodgkins at
the Theater.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 22. - i
The three little burglars arrested last
night are still in the City Prison, and there
does not appear to be any hope of their
I being released on bail, as their parents are
I in poor circumstances and quite unable to
secure an adequate bond.
They were visited by their parents this
I morning, but the little fellows expressed
i no sorrow over their escapade, and are evi
dently not of the kind that are made the
heroes of Sunday-school stories.
As the babies, for they appeared as such,
sat on a bench to-day and told Detective
I Holland again the story of their midnight
I raid on the grocery-store, it seemed almost
impossible to believe that they were telling
the truth. Robert Ash is barely fourteen
years old, Chicken Pacheco is just eleven
and Frank de Rocca is but ten, and yet
they possess more nerve than was shown
by Majors and Wilmorp, the two pioneers
iri the boy-burglary business in Oakland.
"We should never have thought of it if
we hadn't read in the papers about those
boys who did twenty burglaries," said
I Chicken Pacheco, who is certainly the
I most garrulous of the trio. >l When we saw
I Mitchell's store at 803 Castro street., we
! thought that we ought to be able to gpt
some money if we could only pet to his
till. We just wanted to get some good
things, and that's why we broke into the
I store. We were all so frightened that we
only took the money, some cigarettes, to
bacco and twine. We knew we were doing
wrrng all the time. I wanted to go to
'Frisco and see the big City, because me
and Bob have never been there. We just
I threw stones at the window, and it broke.
Nobody came, so we went in."
The lads only secured about $10 and
then they packed their pockets with cigar
ettes and went out for a good time. After
i purchasing some trousers and hats and
| <aking a ride on hired safeties they went
j to the matinee at the Oakland Theater.
| Here two of them were arrested, but De
i Rocca ran off and was caught at Fifth and
Clay streets.
Chief Lloyd talked to the lads and does
not quite know what t'.> think about them.
I "The little fellows are ordinary street boys
: and have evidently been allowed to roam
the streets at all hours of the day and
night, but it is impossible that they
J can be schooled in crime," said
] Chief Lloyd. "They are a study. They
i say that they got the idea of breaking into
ihat store from reading about Majors and
Wilmore. It seems strange that they
should not have paid some attention to
the fact that these two boys are now serv
ing ten years apiece in San Quentin for
their crimes. The whole thing seems to
have been spontaneous on their part.
They only made up their minds to rob the
store in the afternoon, and at night it waa
1 done. 1 suppose they will be*sent to lone,
but even there does not seem to be the
proper place for such lads."
The lads followed the tactics of the
former boy burglars very closely. When
Majors and Wilmore blew open Girard's
sate they went into a shed and waited
over an hour to see if all was safe. Then
they went back and completed the job.
! The three little fellows now in prison
threw stones through the store win-
I dow, and after waiting over half an hour
they crept through the holes and robbed
the till. The lads all admit that they
knew they were doing wrong, but they
s&ow no inclination to cry over their ar
rest.

HIS WONDERFUL VITALITY
Din Murphy Lives With a
Knife Thrust in the Apex of
His Heart.
STABBED BT A CANDY PEDDLER
Dr. Bunnell Says It Is the Most Re
markable Case He Has Ever
Met With.
Daniel Murphy, 19 years of age, was
stabbed in the breast last night bs'Solo
mon Grodner, a candy peddler. The re
markable feature of the affair was that
the wound did not prove immediately
fatal.
The story of the trouble a* learned from
the interested parties and eyewitnesses
indicates that both were to blame. Mur
phy lives with his parents at 5 Eddy
place, between Powell and Mason streets.
He ia employed in the plumbing business.
Grodner has for a long time peddled candy
in iront of the Tivoli and has always been
regarded as a good natured, harmless.fel
low. Last evening he got into a quarrel
with young Murphy and the latter dealt
him a blow in the face which knocked the
candy peddler down and raised a large
lump on his cheek.
He retreated into a cigar stand to repair
damages and he states that he took out his
pocketknife to scrape the mud off his hat.
Grodner returned to the sidewalk and
again met Murphy, who was in com pany
with half a dozen or more young men of
his own age.
Whether he repeated the assault or
Grodner was the aggressor was not learned,
for the interested parties tell different
stories.
Murphy's friends state that the candy
peddler deliberately stabbed the young
man, but Grodner says that he was scrap
ing the mud off his hat with his k nite,
when Murphy renewed the assault, and in
the struggle the w-und was inflicted. He
denied tnat he stabbed Murphy.
The wounded man staggered into the
arms of his companions and was Jed to a
drugstore near by, and Officer Royce tele
phoned for the patrol wagon. Grodner
was arrested and charged with an assault
to commit murder.
Murphy bled freely, and it was feared
that he would not reach the Receiving
Hospital alive. Dr. Bunnell made a care
ful examination of the wound and found
that the knife had entered the body
between the fifth and sixth ribs, and had
penetrated the apex of the heart. The
internal hemorrhage was alarming, par
ticularly as the pulse could not be detected.
Dr. Bunnell stated that it was the
most remarkable case he had ever met
with, and that if the young man lives it
will be still more remarkable, as the
muscles at the apex of the htart have been
punctured.
Bis Legbones Shattered.
Louis Maimer, a bootblack, whose Stand is on
Geary street and Grant avenue, met with an
accident yesterday afternoon that may cost
him the loss of his left leg. While on Green
wich and Powell streets he attempted to stop
a runaway horse attached to a light vehicle.
As the bootblack made a dtÂ«h for the horse he
was thrown violently to tne ground. His left
leg was broken in two places. Maimer was
sent to the Receiving Hospital, where the phy
cians stated that it may be necessary to ampu
tate the leg. The injured man lives at 5 Mont
gomery place.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
In the eyes of the average politician the
only platform worth fighting for is the pie
counter.
The Southern Pacific managers will not
trust their records to the sea any more. It
is safer to burn them.
As the time draws nearer to bounce
Cleveland the spirit of sweet content in
creases among the people.
Before England gets through with this
thing she may find that the Nile bears a
close resemblance to Salt River.
Making a home market for home goods
was strictly business last year, but this
year it is both business and politics.
By some strange oversight the Illinois
Democrats go right along neglecting to put
Mr. Altgeld to the front as a favorite son.
We will stand a better chance to get bet
ter coast defenses and a better navy when
we have a"better tariff to yield a better
revenue. ~
Â»
Up to date no Democrat has had a Presi
dential boom that is worth half as much to
a politician as a small clerkship in a rev- ;
enue office. _
If the worst comes to the worst at the
Chicago convention the " Democrats can
make a ticket of Bayard and Morton and
run them for vindication.
The trouble with the Democratic tariff
is that it is has put a deadly cinch on
American industry for the sake of giving
free trade.to European imports.
Charging $1586 for a service which it
would be grossly exorbitant to charge
$500 for was certainly a good illustration
of putting on all the traffic would bear. -
The Democratic panic has passed away,
but the Democratic tariff is still with us,
and as a consequence Europe supplies us
with goods while our own mills are idle. "â 
Many of our great men went through
hard times in their early days, but the ex
perience of Matt Quay seems to have been
the hardest of all. He was once a school
teacher in Texas.
Judge Grosscup of Illinois is quoted as
saying "expert testimony in Chicago is
largely on the market" and as a result
there has grown up a newspaper demand
that the kind on the market shall be kept
off the witness-stand.
Texas wool-growers who voted the Dem
ocratic ticket are now trying to reason out
the logic of excluding Chinese labor from
competing with American labor and at the
same time allowing Chinese wool to be im
ported free of duty to compete with Amer
ican wool. 'â â .''. ;..
After much discussion and long delay
the postoffices of New York and Brooklyn
are about to be connected by pneumatic
tubes and perhaps with as much discus
sion and after as long delay we might get
a similar communication between â  San
Francisco and Oakland.
According to an estimate made by . the
American Economist the live stock on our
farms was worth in January, 1896, under
the Gorman tariff $733,829,594 less than it
was worth in 1892 under the Republican
tariff. This is one of the reasons farmers
will vote for protection this year.
In expressing surprise that the disasters
resulting from the free trade experiment
have not caused a single Democrat of any
note to come over to the I ranks of protec- i
tion the boston Journal overlooks the fact
that all of them have been too much para
lyzed to crawl out from under the debris.
While some people assert that Cleveland
is supporting Olneyfor the Presidency and
others declare he is backing Carlisle, Sen
ator Gorman is reported to have said to a
friend that " Cleveland would help nobody j
as he desired the place for himself and if
he could not get it he would not care who
did. /
People who believe that horseless car
riages will soon be in general use in this
country argue that if our roads are not so
good as those of Europe our mechanics are :
better, and can succeed in making a moto
cycle suited to. our roads as well as those
now in ' use suit the roads of European
countries. .
=â  Even : in the East Cleveland's aspersions
on the West in his speech ; before the Pres
byterian Board of Home Missions have not
been well receive.). The New York Mail
and Express says: "Mr. Cleveland is
more familiar with city slums than with
Western prairies and should have confined
his remarks to matters within his personal
â¢knowledge."

Three engineers of high repute have re
ported favorably upon the project' of con
structing a ship canal from the Ohio River
at Pittsburc to Lake Erie, and if we are
not vigilant in looking after our own in
terests we may see this scheme undertaken
by the Government before we pet fa suita
ble appropriation for clearing out the chan
nel of the Sacramento. I
A report comes by way of London that
the Government of , New, Zealand contem
plates the enactment of ? a law forbidding
the landing in that country of any person
afflicted with consumption just as persons
afflicted with cholera Â« are excluded from
other countries. The proposed law is in
striking contrast to the course pursued in
: California and it is a good ': subject â  for a
debating society as to which course is the
wiser. .' ' J . . I
A HOME CONTRACT.
That the rolling-mills of San Francisco
have not yet supplied themselves with fa
cilities for turning out the very largest
I pieces of work required in modern engi
j neering and architecture is explainable on
I the sole ground that the local demand has
not justified the heavy outlay required for
that purpose. San Francisco is still a
young City and has but just begun to fall
into the procession headed by the great
Eastern cities in the erection of splendid
structures of steel and masonry. As a
rule the builders of such houses here
within recent years, taking it for granted
that the local rolling-mills could not turn
out the great girders and beams called for
by modern plans, have been content to
draw their supply from the East. The
idea of developing an architectural skill
by which the smaller products of the local
mills could be employed" with perfect
safety and a great industry thus developed
is of very recent birth.
The difficulty was encountered in the
plans of the nineteen-story building which
Claus Spreckels is constructing at the
corner of Market and Third streets, and
which is to be the home of The Call.
This is to be a steel frame 310 feet high,
resting on a narrow base and inclosed with
marble and terra cotta. In handling a
building of less height and with a broader
foundation the structural exactions would
not have been so great. Mr. Spreckels, de
termined that the money for the steel
frame should remain in California, made
a severe draft upon the skill of his archi
tects when he asked them to design the
frame so as to make it possible for our
rolliiig-mills to do the work. This task
was accomplished, the stability of the
structure is assured and one of our own
mills has secured the contract. Hundreds
of thousands of dollars will be thus kept
at home and be turned into the pockets of
our own people.
By such a course as thi3, pursued by all
our builders, may we develop our home
facilities for meeting every need that can
be presented. We are able to compete
with the great shipyards of the Atlantic
and turn out both warships and merchant
vessels of the highest class, simply because
the work has been offered and the faciliti? s
for doing it have baen procured. By en
couraging these industries we make it
possible for them to compete with Eastern
manufacturers and builders; and where
necessarj', as in the case of The Call's
building, it is proper to make such con
cessions in our plans as will enable local
manufacturers to establish themselves on
a full competing basis with the East.
AN UNJUST CHARGE.
Senor Valles y Ribot, leader of the Fed
eral party in Spain, ia reported to have
made the following extraordinary declara
tion: "Although it is absolutely undeni
able that the colonial policy of Spain in
Cuba has been disastrous and despotic to
the extent of fully justifying the insurrec -
tions which have arisen against various
Spanish Governments, still the United
States is the very last nation justified in
raising its voice, as the Spanish policy can
in no way be compared to the sanguinary
methods employed in American territories
which they have forcibly annexed."
These remarks are made by an intelli
gent man. whose natural sympathies
should be with the principles upon wnich
our country was founded. The bitterness
and faisehood of his utterances show either
that he is grossly ignorant of American
history or that he is unfit to lead the politi
cal movement at whose head he stands.
The subjugation of the roving and scat
tered bands of savages originally occu
pying the territory of the United States
was largely a defensive one. It was only
when the incredible atrocities practic?d by
the savages upon white settlers became
unbearable that regular campaigns of con
quest were organized. What few wars we
had with civilized nations for disputed ter
ritory were conducted decorously, and a
great deal of territory was secured by pur
chase both from the savages and civilized
nations. When the natives were finally
conquered they were placed on ample and
exceedingly fertile reservations, encour
aged in the arts of peace and agriculture
and regularly supplied with food and
clothing. In that pursuit many millions
of treasure have been employed. The
whole history of conquest shows nothing
equal to the humane, paternal treatment
which the white conquerors of this country
have shown to the aboriginal occupants.
How has it been in the countries subju
gated by Spain? Surely Senor Valles y Ri
bot cannot have forgotten Cortez and his
relentless destruction of the finest and
purest civilization that the Western Conti
nent contained. Americans never made
peons of their conquered savages. We
never humbled and degraded them and
used them as beasts of burden. To this
day those of them who wish to be peaceful
and retrain from committing theft, arson
and murder (and it is rarely now that such
as these place themselves in evidence) re
ceive more consideration than any Amer
ican citizen. Our own people may starve,
but the savages whose country we occupy
are provided with the richest lands, are fed
and clothed at the public expense and are
protected in their rights and privileges by
the army of the United States. Where
they have shown an inclination to rise
above savagery and adopt peaceful methods
of livelihood they are given the right to
make their own laws and maintain a gov
ernment after their own ideas. Spanish
history shows nothing analogous to the
Cherokee Nation in the United States.
Whenever our savages revolted it was to
secure liberty to plunder and kill. The
Cuban revolution is one, not of savages,
but of a people who generations ago adopted
civilization and who are now fighting for
the right to enjoy its benefits. It might
profit Senor Valles y Ribot to inquire more
closely into American history before deny
ing that we have the right to protest
against the unjust oppression of any civil
ized race. ____^^______
BAYARD IMPREGNABLE.
The news comes all the way from Lon
don that as Minister Bayard cannot be
officially informed that the House of Rep
resentatives has censured him there is no
official reason for his resignation, and that,
following his own and President Cleve
land's inclination, he proposes to hang on
till his successor is appointed by the next
President. This sounds incredible. His
present attitude is even more supercilious
than that which he assumed when he
made a miblic speech in England denounc
| ing the American policy of a protective
I tariff.
Mr. Cleveland's opportunity to convince
the world that he was a genuine American
came with the delivery of Mr. Bayard's
speech. He should have recalled this
voluble gentleman at once. We may
leave aside the question of the right
or wroag of the protective idea. It
was not the Republican party that Mr.
Bayard offendeu when he assailed its
doctrine of protection in furtherance of the
Democratic idea of free trade. His offense
was national in its effect. As the personal
representative of the head of an American
political party, and as the accredited rep
resentative of this Nation in Great Britain,
I he denationalized himself, and truckled to ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 23, 1896.
the English sentiment, which favors the
policy of the American party to which he
belongs. His attitude proclaimed that he
was more of a Democrat than an American,
and that he was in England as the repre
sentative of the Democratic party and
President Cleveland, rather than of the
American people.
His superciliousness then and his lofty
bearing now, especially in view of the fact
that the President did not remove him for
his offense, can be taken only as Mr. Cleve
land's personal bearing. This may iiean
less to the Democrats than to the country
at large. It is something new in American
politics for a President to stock our foreign
ministries with political agents devoted to
the advancement of the politics which he
advocates. The importance of this case is
evident when we reflect that the English
policy of free trade and monometallism
dominates the course of our present ad
ministration.
SUPPKESSINC EVIDENCE.
The English House of Lords has heard
read for the second time the bill intro
duced at the instance of Lord Salisbury
empowering judges to prohibit the publi
cation of such evidence adduced in trials
as might tend to injure public morals. As
might have been expected, the measure is
attracting a great deal of attention. The
dispatches venture no opinion as to
whether it will probably become a law, but
the likelihood is that it will not. Already
there are laws both in England and the
United States permitting the parties to a
divorce suit to demand that the evidence
shall not be published, but the reason for
them is altogether different from that lying
behind, the measure which Lord Salisbury
is urging.
Lord Glenesk, proprietor of the Morning
Post, properly asserts that some novels
contain many things that are far moce
offensive and injurious than can be found
in the newspapers. When these books can
be bought without restriction for a price
only slightly larger than that of a news
paper the inconsistency of the proposed
gag law is evident. Lord Glenesk says
further, that the tendency of the press is
quite against the publication of unsavory
details. That unmistakably is true in
England. The departures from the rule
in this country have been made only by
those newspapers which prefer a transient
business success to the exercise of an in
fluence that can come only from an appre
ciation of moral responsibility. That which
tends to degrade cannot command the re
spect of the controlling forces of civiliz
ation.
At the same time, publicity within de
corous bounds is the most efficient of all
agencies for the prevention of evil. That
is one of the important functions of a
newspaper. The highest morality, liberty
and enlightenment are found in those
countries where the freedom of the press
is the least restricted. Corruption, politi
cal or otherwise, is most rampant where
its exposure is most rigidly prohibited.
There is an undying quality in light and
truth that inevitably punishes the agenc.es
which oppress it.
COAST EXCHANGES.
The Mountain View Register, in noting
the circulation of a petition for the forma
tion of a protection district including the
land between the railroad and the bay,
along Stevens Creek, calls timely attention
to the law authorizing such a step. It was
framed for the purpose of enabling land
owners to protect their property against
overflows. The property-owners within the
limits of the district are assessed for three
fourths of the expense, each in proportion
to his number of acres, and the county
pays the other fourth. By organizing rec
lamation districts thousands of acres of
marsh lands bordering the lower end of
San .Francisco Bay could be reclaimed and
made exceedingly valuable.
The Riverside Enterprise publishes the
following in a letter from Perris: "The
unnecessary, almost criminal, delay of the
United States Supreme Court in deferring
decision in the Wright irrigation cases and
the closing down of the Good Hope and
Santa Rosa mines have cast a gloom of de
pression over the Perris Valley country,
but with the vast resources which this sec
tion contains the blackness can only be
temporary, and we hope before many
weeks to be able to chronicle a revival of
interest in every line of business."
West Berkeley, according to the Gazette,
has organized the West Berkeley Progres
sive Club for the purpose of making the
place more inviting by securing more street
railroads and a better water supply. For
these and other improvements the residents
must lend a vigorous hand and an open
pocket-book. Charles A. Bailey, a large
property-owner and progressive citizen, is
trying to work up a feeling of enterprise
among the people, and has offered $1000 as
a subscription toward a fund for building
a power-house and making some railroad
company a present of it. If there were
many' more such residents as he West
Berkeley would soon become a favorite
place of residence and even more prosper
ous than at present.
The Ventura Press announces that Ven
tura is on the eve of a healthy boom. The
oil refinery is to be built at once, the new
railroad to Nordhoff is practically assured,
and agents looking for a *ite on which to
establish a sugar refinery have been
busy. '"The soil," says our contemporary,
"is well adapted to the culture of the sugar
beet, and if a sufficient number of land
owners can be induced to plant the sugar
beets, so that there will be at least 1000
acres to draw on, the sugar works will be
erected. We understand that nearly the
required amount of acreage has been se
cured." When to all this is added the fact
that Ventura is to be on the southern over
land line, there is every good reason for
our contemporary* prediction.
The Fresno Expositor says that every
thing is- encouraging with regard to the
recently developed oil region in the foot
hills near Huron. Captain Barrett's wells
are more than 300 feet down and the indi
cations are excellent. Other companies
are actively preparing to bore. The indi
cations are that the fuel problem of the
San Joaquin ValJey is soon to be solved.
The charms of Hayward are familiar to
those who have enjoyed them, among
whom are many wealthy persons. The
Evening Mail has this to say: "Hayward
being a suburb of San Francisco and Oak
land we number among our residents many
merchants who travel daily between our
city and those business centers in the
transaction of their affairs. We offer
special inducements to these, who. after
finishing their day's labor in the hum and
bustle of the larger cities, desire to lay
down the cares of life and enjoy a home
life peace in a neighborhood of genteel
respectability."
The Santa Cruz Penny Press announces
the important discovery in tnat county of
a large bed of clay suitable for all kiuJs of
pottery except china and terra cotta. -The
discoverer, Alfred Bowman, says therfe is
about twenty-five acres of clay beds or; the
tract, and he knows it is twenty feet deep.
He says the land is easy of access and con
venient for fuel and shipping purposes.
This should be welcome news to capital
ists who want to find an excellent invest
ment.
The Santa Cruz Sentinel sÂ»ys: "Next
Monday F. R. Cummings will begin to
drive piles for a bulkhead for an artificial
lake on the Spreckels Aptos Hotel prop
erty. In all 250 piles are to be driven.
Orders have been given to demolish the
hotel and cottages to make room for Claus
Spreckela' country residence. The club
house is to be raised and a brick founda
tion built. Mr. Soreckels intends to erect
a schoolhonse on his Aptos ranch and pre
sent it to the county. He intends to ex
pend $250,000 in improvements on his Ap
tos property. Recently be purchased a
large tract of land in the Salinas Valley,
which he will subdivide and erect cottages
thereon. There is also talk of his building
a sugar factory. The sum total of his in
vestments in the SalinasValley will amount
to $1,000,000."
It is pleasing to read in the Stockton
Independent that Henderson & Son of that
city have just finished two handsome
stage wagons for an Idaho line. Our con
temporary adus that Stockton already has
ths best of the Idaho stage-building busi
ness. The two new creations must be su
perb. They are to carry fourteen passen
gers and have all the most approved ap
pliances for the handling of express mat
ter, mails and baggage. For Idaho, which
is so much more convenient to Minneapo
lis, to come to Stockton for its stage
coaches is a thing to be proud of. This is
not to be wondered at when it is reflected
that Stockton turns out the finest agricul
tural machinery in the world and that the
Northwestern cities have found them
selves unable to compete with it in that
particular.
The Stockton Mail announces that the
San Joaquin Water Company's south
branch canal is within three miles of Lath
rop and that water can be turned on as
soon as the flumes are constructed. The
effect of this great improvement is thus fore
shadowed by our contemporary: "Rich
ard Threlfall, who owns land near Liitle
john Creek, has ditched 1500 acres and
made it ready for irrigation, and 500 acres
in the Orange Blossom Colony on the
Stanislaus River will be cut up for orchards.
Very little land has been pledged for irri
gation since the report in the "Mail a few
months ago .when the amount under con
tract, as shown by the booKs in the County
Recorder's office, was about 20,000 acres."
This, from the Oakdale Leader, shows
how that prosperous community is work

The Brentwood Enterprise thus indicates
the benefits which a community may
enjoy by exercising a little enterprise:

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Colonel William Fonythe, the well-known
Fresno vineyardist, is in the City on business.
He had â ome very caustic remarks to make
yesterday in regard to the California Â«ystem of
marketing its fruit product. He has 160 acres
of the best raisin vines in Fresno. "Clusters,"
he remarked, "and London layers are not sell
ing for any more in the sweat box than loose
raisins. One and one-eighth cents is the high
est price offered per pound, but the average is
1 cent, which only pays for the picking and
does not begin to defray other expenses.
Dried peaches, worth 8 cents a pound, are
bringing 2 cents; prunea and other dried fruits
in like proportion."
With all this the Colonel thinks that Fresno
has the best of it as compared with other coun

SOME DAY OR OTHER.
Time enouith yet for the current to turnâ
'â Hope while there's life," as philosophers say;
People now poor may have mone\- to tear,
Provided they don't quit thp job in despair.
Plod right ahead and you'll bring 'em your way-
Some day or other.
Facts grow on bushes for some, so It seems,
Others obliged, if they want 'em. to climb
Early and lateâ but what if you do ?
No use to worry and fret yourself blue.
Plod right along and you'll bring 'em to time-
Some day or oiher.
Love-making's easy for some, it appears,
But what if it isn't for you ?
Going to sit back like a bump on a board ?
No, you'll propose, and If you should pet floored
Speak your piece over and she'll help you
through-
Some day or other.
Knew a man once who for twenty straight years
Courted a girl; but he hadn't the sand
To ask her . o marry till finally she
Lps and she asks what his moaning might be,
Which shows that a woman, by watching her
hand,
Can fetch the most bashful admirer to land-
Some day or other.
Nothing you want you can't pet if you plodâ
Mor.ey or learning or even the fair.
Tackle the task with grim death in your eye,
Buckle right to It and never say die;
Bound to win out if you really care-
Some day or other.

PARAGRAPHS ABOUT PEOPLE.
A memorial has been placed over the door of
the villa in Johu street, London, where John
Keats, the poet, lived and worked. It consists
of a tablet bearing the inscription, "John
Keats, poet, lived in this house. B. 1795; d.
1821."
The German Empress is said to have worn a
robe with a train six yards long on the occa
sion of the Emperor's birthday. It was of the
finest Lyons silk, the material alone being
worth $1500, while the embroidery in the
working occupied twelve persons for at least
two months.
The Reed campaign button, which has ap
peared in Washington, has on it the picture of
a male cat standing on a wall bracket, beneath
which is a representation of a marsh reed.
The picture is. of course, a rebus which is ex
pected to luggest Thomas Bracket Reed to the
beholder.
W. M. Greene, the new general manager of
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, is a native
of Athens, Ohio. On his graduation from
Wooster University he became clerk in a rail
road office. In 1887 he became assistant to
President Ingalls on the Big Four, and in 1889
was made general manager of that company.
The attempt to raise a fund for the erection
of a statue of Darwin at Shrewsbury, England,
has so far been a failure. Up to the present
time only about Â£380 has been subscribed, and
a circular has just been issued pointing out
that the sura received is wholly inadequate ior
carrying out the object in view in a manner
worthy of so eminent a man.
A SAN FRANCISCAN IN EGYPT.
Cairo Sphinx.
Colonel George Â£. Raum of San Francisco,
who has twice previously visitea Egypt, has
now on his third visit embarked on a most
interesting work of excavation at the sphinx
and pyramids of Ghizeh, having first obtained
the permission of the Government. The colonel
commenced operations a few days ago and has
nearly 100 men and boys at work under his
skilled guidance, for he has had much experi
ence of mining and excavation both as a
colonel ol engineers in the Confederate Army
and as a mine-owner in the gold diggings of
Colorado. It may, therefore, be taken as
granted that the works in progress will be ful
filled with judarment and in accordance with
technical knowledge. Colonel Raum has
cleared away the sand from the base of the
sphinx to a considerable depth. He has also
cleared out the hole in the top of the head to a
depth cf seven feet, the cross measurements of
the hole beine about 3% feet long by 214 feet
broad. The hole passes tiirough the cap of the
sphinx for about six feet, and the remaining
one foot is drilled through the solid rock out
of which the rest of the head is cut. At the
back of the sphinx a shaft has been found,
and the sand which filled it hat been cleared
away to a depth of twenty-five feet. At the
bottom of the shaft two passages have been
found running in a northwest and southwest
direction respectively. This was as far as the
works had been carried on the day we visited
them, and we look forward to some interesting
discoveries through the disinterested labors of
Colonel Raum, who is bearing the whole of
the expenses.

California for Tobacco.
San Diego Union.
There are indications that the time is not

mended by experts.
No Charitable Institutions There.
Ilanford Democrat-
Provisions are very scarce in the interior of
Alaska and prices for necessaries rule very
high. There are no charitable organizations
in that Territory, and the man who goes broke
there is liable to fare badly. Thinit twice or

A THIEF-PROOF CHICKEN-HOUSE.
James Maloney, who lives near Twenty-fifth
street on that prairie in Oakland known as
Temescal, is the inventor of what he calls a
"thief-proof chicken-house." It is all he claims
for it, as has been shown by a practical test of
several months. Maloney is a strong admirer
of fancy fowl, but has heretofore been ham
pered in his inclination to breed them by the
fact that his neighbors also admired them and
preferred those that he raised to raising them
themselves. No matter how many locks he
put on his chicken-house, or how many dogs he
kept about the premises, his fowls always dis
appeared until he perfected his invention.
Maloney's chicken-house did not cost him
anything'but his labor. He found a large bar
rel in the backyard of what had once been a sa
loon, and a telegraph pole he picked up on the
street one night. It was a little hard to get
them home, but after they Were there the rest
was easy. He cut a hole In the top and bottom
of the barrel for the pole to go through and
also one for a door. Several smaller ones for
air holes were bored in the sides and the
chicken-house was ready to be placed in posi
tion.
This was quite a job, but after fastening the
barrel securely to the pole Maloney got a man
to help him raise it and fix it in the ground.
After putting a few braces at the bottom of the
pole and making a ladder to lead up to the
door all was in readiness for tenants.
A little trouble was experienced in getting
the chickens to go into the odd and lofty dwell
ing, but by putting their feed up there every
night they soon learned the way. Maloney
has nbout twenty-five chickens that he keeps
in the barrel, but they all seem to find plenty
of room and keep in good health. As soon as
i
James Maloney's Invention to Foil
Chicken-Thieves.
[From a sketch.]
the chickens have gone to roost Maloney closes
the door and takes the ladder into his own
house, feeling sure that they will all De there
in the morning. The old chicken houses are
used for laying, and whenever a hen wants to
sit he gives her a place behind the kitchen
stove. This is satisfactory to all concerned,
and the ticcx is oonntnntly increasing.
LADY'S COLLARETTE OR SHORT
CAPE.
The collarette or small cape shown here is a
most useful as well as stylish garment. It may
be made of material matching a dress, or of
cloth, or silk to be worn with any costume. A3
here shown it is made of blue cloth, over
which is black perforated satin, making the
garment at once warm and dressy. An im
mense bow of black satin finishes the back of
thÂ« standing collar. Narrow black lace edges
the points, and the front is finished with
black cniffon, a bunch of blue flowers set at
the throat and at the edges. A few green
leaves set among the nicks at the top, and a
green chiffon finish for the front makes a
charming finish.
The pattern of the cape proper is in one
piece. A standing and a turn-over collar are
included in the pattern. The cape has six
points, two of which fall just back of the
sleeves, two over them and the remaining two
are in front.
Black lawn over silk, changeable green and
black, with black chiffon and violets, is a
beautiful combination.
Spangled net over pale old green satin, fin
ished at the edges with spangles, is another
elegant combination of color and materials.
Black velvet with white satin lining aud
white chiffon is extremely-stylish.
For evening a white Dresden silk with pink
bouqneta and green leaves is dainty with
tiny pink crush roses for a throat ruff, and one
row of the same set round the edges.

WILL GO TO THE ARCTIC
The Old Brig Hidalgo Will Try
Another Cruise to the
Frozen North.
BEST KNOWN WHALER AFLOAT.
Her Captain Says She Has Been in
More Scrapes Than a Dozen
Other Ships.
The old whaling brig Hidalgo is again
going to tempt fate in the frozen north.
In years past she has made fortunes for
half a dozen owners, and Captain "Lew"
Williams is of the opinion that the vessel
is now as good as ever she was, and that
on her return to San Francisco next No
vember she will have the result of a suc
cessful season abroad.
On her last cruise the brig met with hard
luck, and all she had in her hold was trade
in the ?hape of fox skins and ivory. The
profits on these, however, paid the ex
penses of the vessel, so there was no loss
to her owner. Captain Williams will not
go to the Arctic this season, and Captain
C. F. Gifford will take the vessel out. Last
year he made a most successful voyage in
the Cape Horn Pigeon, and expects to re
neat it in the brig.
The Hidalgo is one of the best-known
vessels under the United States flag. In
her young days she was a privateer, and
many a time she ran the blockade in
Southern waters. After the war she was
turned into a passenger ship, and later
carried freight between Eastern points
and Europe. When steam superseded sail
she was sold and turned into a whaler.
Year after year she has gone to the Arctic,
and year after year has she returned laden
with oil ana Done. Captain Williams has
not made a fortune out of her, but, never
theless, he nas enough to live ashore and
keep the wolf from the door.
The old Hidalgo could tell many a tale
of the sea if only her timbers could speak.
On one occasion she was lifted up onto a
cake ot ice and was carried along for twen
ty-four hours in the direction of the north
pole. "If that ice had only held together,"
said Captain Williams yesterday, "I would
have discovered that north pole sure, and
saved Nansen all this trouble."
On another occasion when the brig was
carrying lumber from Eureka to San Fran
cisco she went on Humboldt bar. Her
crew deserted her, but with the next tide
the Hidalgo floated off and went to sea
on her own account. Her crew chased after
her in a tug and once more taking posses
sion navigated her to San Francisco. She
was docked, but not $5 worth of re
pairs had to be made. She has been ashore
dozens of times in the Arctic, and "Joe"
Spencer says she hae had more narrow es
capes than any half dozen ships afloat.
Still to-day she is as sound as a dollar and
can make better time under sail than any
vessel in the fleet.
The Hidalgo is at present in Oakland
Creek, but this week she will be brought to
San Francisco and after overhauling will
start on her eight-months' cruise.
AT THE PLAY.
The Shows That Are to Be Presented
at the Theaters in This City
This Evening.
At the California Theater this evening
the management will continue "Captain
Impudence." the piece having proved
such an attraction that it is considered a
drawing card for another week. "Friends,"
which had been announced for this even
ing, will be put on next Monday.
Tbe Baldwin people have discovered
that there is nothing that succeeds like
success, and as "The Milk White Flag"
has proved such a success, they have con
cluded to run it one week longer, conse
quently that will be the play for this even
ing.
David Henderson's Extravaganza Com
pany will open to-night at the Columbia
in "Sinbad," that gorgeous spectacular
production that pleases the adults and
amuses the little ones. Some new and
striking features have been introduced
since it was last produced in this city.
Novelty follows novelty at the Grand
Opera-house. To-night there will be pre
sented Carroll Johnson's great comedy
drama. "The Irish Statesman," a combina
tion of Irish and American life. A feature
will be the introduction of a number of
solo and part sonzs.
This evening that mirth-provoking pro
duction entitled "Confusion" will be pre
sented to the patrons of the Alcazar. This
will be given in connection with the con
tinuous show that is offered every even
ing ana which has caught the popular
taste and approval.
The management of the Tivoli Opera
house will this evening present "Said
Pasha," the popular opera by Richard
Stahl. It is said that it will be carefully
staged and that the costumes will be mag
nificent. Francis Powers win make his
debut in this opera.
The funniest of funny individuals, Se
gommer, will make his appearance at the
Orpheum Music Hall to-night. From what
the Eastern papers say he is an attraction
that alone will fill any house. In addition
there will be a number of specialty artists
to entertain the patrons.
At Macdonough's Theater, in Oakland,
Nellie McHenry will this evening present
"The Bicycle Girl," which had such a suc
cessful run in this City. She will be sup
ported ny the company that appeared here
with her, and her engagement is but for
two nights.
BRANDISHED A CLUB.
A Crazy Man Creates a Sensation at
North Beach and Struggles Like
a Demon.
A stalwart young man crazed from drink
created a sensation at North Beach yester
day afternoon by running wildly through
the streets brandish ing a baseball bat.
He started upon the rampage at the cor
ner of Stockton and Bay streets, soon af
ter knocked down a man named Harring
ton and then headed for the seawall, a
score of stevedores joining in the pursuit.
As he ran he continued to bellow,
"Buckley, save me." He was finally over
hauled at seawall 2 by Tom Maxwell and
given in charge of Officer Kainsbury,
who summoned the patrol wagon.
When the wagon arrived it took the
combined efforts of three officers and oth
er!* to get the maniac into it, his clothes
being torn from his body in the struggle.
At the station he gave the name of An- J
drew Jackson McKinley.
I.eague of the Cross.
There was a rally of St. Teresa's branch of
the League of the Cross yesterday. It was
largely attended and an excellent programme
was rendered. Regimental drills are being
held weekly by the cadets in preparation for
the coming competitive contest at the Me
chanics' Pavilion. The trophy last year was
won by the St. Patrick's branch. The boys are
taking the keenest interest in their practice
and a bard-fought battle may be expected.
Father Yorke to Lecture.
Rev. P. C Yorke will lecture at St. Francis
de Sales Church, Oakland, on the evening: of
Palm Sunday. A musical programme has also
beeo arranged for the occasion.

HOW ABOUT HYPNOTISM?
What Some Local Medicos Think
of It as a Therapeutic
Agent.
DR. LORD CALLS IT A FRAUD.
Other Physicians Believe That It May
Be Employed Advantageously
in Hysteria.
The employment of hypnotism as a
therapeutic agent seems to be achieving
new triumphs day by day. Among local
physicians there is not, however, mani
fested so great an interest in the subject as
might be imagined. A large number of
the local practitioners belong to the old
high-and-dry school which clings to the
well-tried drugs and powders and pills of
the past, and look askance at other than
material remedies.
Others, again, while admitting the pos
sible utility and efficiency of the hypnotic
treatment, are of the opinion that its pub
lication to the world at the present stage
is premature and ill-advised, since it has
not yet demonstrated its reliability and
safety. Still others appear to scout the
theory of hypnotism's therapeutic virtue
as a wild freak of fancy.
Dr. G. E. Caglieri was one of those who
profess having no practical acquaintance
with the new curative agent, and yet dis
play no small conversance with it, theo
retically, at least.
â¢'I remember going to one or two of Dr.
Stahl's clinics in New York," remarked the
doctoryesterday, "and though I had never
made a study of occult therapeutics and
understand little or nothing about them
now, I could not help being interested in
them. lam satisfied no fraud was prac
ticed. Dr. Stahl himself is a man of un
questioned integrity and professional
honor, bo I was sure of him. As for t lie
patients, or subjects, their symptoms could
not have been counterfeited. As I said
before, I iiave never looked deeply into
the matter, so perhaps the wisest thing for
me to do would be to say nothing. StiÂ»i
nowadays everybody talks of everything,
whether he understands what he talks
about or not.
"I think, however, that much can be
said in favor of hypnotism as a sedative
in cases of hysteria. I recollect one case
which came under my care some weeks
ago. The patient was suffering from or
ganic troubles. His disease was under
treatment and the sufferer, a young man
of about 2.5 years, well on the road toward
recovery. His case had reached this stage
when I was hastily called by a member of
the patient's family, who assured me that
the poor fellow had gone insane. I found
him apparently a maniac, raving,
Kicking and throwing himself about in
the most violent manner. Some of the
prominent symptoms of dementia, how
ever, were absent, so I got Borne men to
help me hold the young fellow while I*
applied a few sedatives of the simplest
character. In ten minutes he came to
himself, and, though weakened by his late
contortions, had suffered no injury. Per
haps hypnotism might have helped him.
I regarded the case as one of hysteria in
duced by physical pain, and all I did was
to endeavor to calm both abnormal con
ditions.
"It is common to disregard hysteria, and
yet hysteria is frequently the index to se
rious internal troubles. I recollect the case
of a lady who imagined herself the victim
of innumerable disorders. I examined her
carefully from time to time, and finding
other portions of her body in a perfectly
sound condition, was at length able to nar
row down her imaginary ailments until
she complained of illness in only one spot.
Then I made the most searching examina
tion of the seat of trouble and found its
cause in the shape of an enlarged internal
organ. Now this lady was undoubtedly a
great sufferer from hysteria, and the hys-
teria might have been cured by hypnotic
treatment. But would any amount of 'sug
gestion' bo able to reduce the size of the
organ whose enlargement was the real
cause of the trouble, of which the hysteria
was only a symptom?"
Dr. Robert A. McLean believed the mat
ter of new treatments one deserving of
careful consideration.
"I do not believe," he remarked, "that
any good can come from the premature
publication of new therapeutic methods.
These are subjects which require the ear
nest and most profound study of master
minds. In the meantime we have certain
remedies which we know by experience
are effective. We have watched their re
sults in our practice from year to year.
Doubtless as our methods surpass those of
former ages so will the remedies of the fu
ture far surpass our own, but new discov
eries in medicine are not to be used until
after they have been well tried. For in
stance, we hear so much nowadays about
cancer cures, yet the fact remains that
thus far no remedy has been found but the
knife.
"The case is the same with consump
tion after the disease has reached a certain
stage. Yet I hope remedies for both these
terrible agents of death may in time be
discovered. But to the medical world
alone should the investigation and prov
ing of new medical discoveries be rele
gated. Their premature publication is a
pregnant occasion of evil, since it affords
an opportunity to charlatans for practi
cing upon the public, and, what iB worse,
leads to the sacrifice of many lives."
Dr. F. F. Lord was fierce in his denun
ciation of the new curative agent.
"The thing is a humbug," he declared.
"All my life I have had a sneaking relish
for the mysteries of medicine, and have
studied much that has been written in
relation to them. We know that certain
minds influence others; but to imagine
that one mind can so influence the mind
of a man as to effect a change for the
better in his physical structure seems be
yond belief. What amount of mind cure,
of 'passes,' or of incantations can drive
the germs of disease from any orgsn in
which they may have found lodgment?
The idea is utterly preposterous.
"As for hypnotizing," continued the
doctor, "there may be something in it,
but thus far I have been unable to con
vince myself that any healthy mind can
be put to sleep by another and deprived of
its sense and volition at that other's will.
As for myself I am ready to pay $1000 to
the man or woman who will hypnotize me
for two minutes."
NEW TELEPHONE SYSTEM
Extensive Use to Be Made of
Long-Distance Instru
ments.
City Conduits to Contain Tubes for
Rapid Transmission of
Packages.
In the way of gaining popular support
for a new enterprise in telephoning some
active and effectual work has been done
j by the People's Mutual Telephone Com-
I pany. The new institution has enrolled
I 1800 subscribers, who agree to use the ser
vice for three or five years as their con
tracts may specify.
The purpose of the company is to begin
active business operation with an enroll
ment of 3000 subscribers. So positive is
i the assurance that the desired patronage
i will be obtained that the managers have
applied for a franchise in San Francisco.
I In due course of time applications for
franchise will be made in other counties of
tbe State.
Speaking of the enterprise last evening,
James L. Crittenden, president of the com
pany, indicated that, the work of construc
tion under the franchise would be of a
most substantial and enduring character.
The conduits will be placed in the ground
to last and afford the best form of service.
In addition to the space required for the
wires there will be ample room for a tube,
by means of which letters and packages
may be rapidly* transmitted.
Mr. Crittenden has made thorough ex
amination of modern telephonic appliances
and given special attention to long distance
methods and instruments. He says the
new company will not put in short distance
instruments, but will provide generally for
service extending to the distance of 1000
miles on direct wire. He produces figures
to show that the cost of transmittin g mes
sages may be cheapened much below the
present minimum cost of telegraphic ser
vice to the press.
The citizens of San Francisco are prom
ised, under the new enterprise, a tele
phone service equal in point of cheapness
and extension to that enjoyed by the most
favored of Eastern cities. Figures are ad
duced showing that the people of Saa
Francisco have been paying enormous
tolls for the use of telephones, hence the
new company invites popular support on
the ground of affording public relief.
The capital stock of the company is
$5,000,000, and the subscribers receive in
stock an amount equal to the payments
they make for telephone service.
The Crossing Inspection.
The following communication from Mr.
Baiily regarding the sewerage and crossing
at Twelfth avenue and California street is self
explanatory :
San Francisco, March 21, 1896.
To the Editor of The. Callâ Dear Sib: Last
Wednesday I made a statement to one of your re
porters that the Board of Health did i.ot send an
inspector to examine the sewerage and crossing on
Twelfth avenue and California street, wnich are In
a bad condition.
Since then I investigated the matter and found
that the inspector was there.
I also attended a meeting of the Street Commit
tee of the Board of .Supervisors and heard the in
spector's report read, which convinced me that the
matter was properly attended to.
As a matter of justice to the Board of Health I
most respectfully ask you to publish this state
ment. Very respectfully, j. j, Baili-y,
Twelfth avenue and California street, Richmond
District.
Sanborn, Vail & Co. have new goods all over
their store. Don't think of old styles or old
prices. What $1 used to buy 50 cents will
likely buy now. They have stacks of new and
beautiful things in pictures, frames, artists'
Materials, leather goods, stationery, lamps
and shades, artificial flowers and toilet articles.*
MONUMENT TO GRANT
A Site in Golden Gate Park Is
Selected by the Memorial
Committee.
FOR THE OCEAN BOULEVARD.
Chief Engineer Sullivan Thinks There
Ought to Be an Engine Com
pany at Sutro Heights.
Yesterday forenoon General W. H. L.
Barnes, Edgar de Pue, Commodore Con
O'Connor, .Rupert Schmid, the sculptor,
and Park Commissioner Irving M. Scott,
accompanied by Superintendent McLaren,
went over the central portion of Golden
Gate Park in search for a site upon which
to place the bust of General 11. 8. Grant,
procured by the Grant memorial com
mittee.
The visitors came to the conclusion that
the proper place for the bust would be at
a point north and west of the cider press,
near where at this time there is a chimp of
eucalyptus trees. If placed tnere it can be
seen by every one who drives around the
grand court and by all who visit the
museum.
" There are a great many curiosities in
plants and flowers," said Gardener Hol
brook, a graduate of the Kew Gardens of
England, who has charge of the conserva
tory, as he pointed to a number of plants
on a bench in one of the hothouses, and
which looked like young acacias. "We
call them Mimosa pudieia, or the sensitive
plant. It comes from Mexico, and is so
sensitive that a slight touch causes the
leaves to close as tight as a clam." In
proof of this he touched several leaves
wit ii i one of his fingers and they closed,
remaining in that condition for about live
minutes, when they returned to their
former appearance. He then blew across
them, and the leaves closed and drooped
as if they had been sun-withered. These
will be placed on exhibition in about two
weeks.
"We have also," he added, "a fine as
sortment of most delicately shaded and
transparent specimens of the caladium,
commonly called the bleeding heart, which
will also be exhibited. One of these is a
wonder. It is called the caricature plant,
from the fact that each of the many spots
on the leaves bears a resemblance in cari
cature to men, women, animals and birds.
No two spots are alike."
Some of the spots shown bore a strong
resemblance to Jimmy Swinnerton'g bears.
Another is a good grotesque picture of
Mayor Sutro.
A magnificent flower will be placed in
the main conservatory this week. It is also
from Mexico and is called La Flor de San
Sebastian, because it flowers in that coun
try on San Sebastian's day. It varies from
litht purple to lilac, and is extensively
used for church decoration. Another rare
plant that will be placed on exhibition is
the bee orchid of Java.
On account of the painters' strike] work
on the interior of the new lodge in the
park is delayed. "We are paying full
union rates, and have conceded the de
mand as to the card system," said Super
intendent McLaren, "still the men are
taken away."
Not being able to spare the teams at this
time the work of placing the top dressing
on the new bicycle track will be delayeu
for two weeks.
The tunnel under the main drive was
finished on Saturday night and now the
Commissioners are to determine whether
the bridge to be built over it shall be of
concrete, granite or blue stone, such
as was used in the building of the
lodge.
To-day the contractors who have been
working the ocean boulevard, and have
completed it for a distance of one mile,
will place the fine rock on it and then roil
it. The Park Commissioners will to-day
commence to plant bunch grass on the
west side of tne boulevard,- its entire
length, to prevent the ocean sand from
drifting. The planting will be fifty feet in
width.
The tree-planting in the grand court is
nearly finished, and within two weeks this
part "of the park will be decidedly at
tractive.
Chief Engineer Sullivan was a visitor to
Sutro Heights yesterday afternoon, and as
he viewed the many buildings that have
been erected there ol late, he said: "It is
really too bad that there is no protection
against fire here. It is true that there are
hydrants, connected with an 8-inch main
of the Spring Valley Company, but while
they have a 60-pound pressure, they are
practically useless as it is next to impossi
ble to get engines out here. There is so
much property at stake here that there
ought to be a second-class engine, out here.
This is a matter that should be considered
before it is too late."
It is probable that the chief will recom
mend the locating of an engine company
in tr.at district.
At the Haight-street ground there was
not a very large crowd, but Professor
Markeberg went up in his balloon at 15 :15
o'clock and made a successful ascent, car
rying up with him a basket containing two
homing pigeons belonging to Mrs. Otto
Brewitt of Alameda. The birds were freed
at an elevation of 1000 feet, and after cir
cling around for a few moments they took
their flight eastward. On one occasion
these birds were set free from the top of
the electric tower, and they reached their
cote in Alameda in eleven minutes.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Brig Salvador Arrives
From Clipperton Island
in Ballast.
VISITORS TO THE COMANCHE.
Rough Voyage of the Barkentine
Eurekaâ Vallejo Passenger
Fare Reduced.
Notwithstanding the cloudy and rainy
weather on the bay quite a large number
of visitors went aboard the Monitor Oo
manche. Lieutenants Douglas and Gunn
and Ensigns Elliott and Burke were
aboard with a detail of the battalion, and
the old vessel took on a cruiser-like ap
pearance.
The brig Salvador arrived yesterday
from Clipperton Island in ballast. The
captain reports that the weather was so
stormy. and the sea so high that he couhl
not ship his cargo of guano and had to sail
without the load.
The barkentiue Eureka came in also yes
terday, eighty days from San Jose de
Guatemala. She is on her way to Port
Townsend and puts in here for repairs.
The mate, Frank Berlie, fell from the rig
ging February '24 and struck the rail,
breaking his shoulder. He was taken
ashore at Champerico. John Mawnner
berg, a seaman, aged 46, died from natural
causes and was buried at sea. On March
3, in latitude 30 deg. 50 mm. north and
longitude 133 deg. 20 mm. west, she en
countered ft furious gale, whioh carried
away the mizzen-topmast and otherwise
badly damaged the vessel.
To-day the opposition steamer Monte
cello wilJ sell round-trip tickets at Vallejo
good for a passage to this City and return
lor 50 cents. This cut is made to meet that
of the Southern Pacific Railroad, which
began yesterday to sell round-trip tickets
between those* places for $1. These re
duced tickets are only sold in Vallejo.
Captain Hatch of the Montecello says he
will stay in the fight with Mr. Hunting
ton, and will meet that gentleman's cut in
rates just as long as the traveling public is
with the steamer.
He says in his notice of the new fare :
"Unlike* the president of the Southern
Paciric we must rely upon our receipts to
pay our expenses. If the people who are get
ting the benefit of our competition do not
give us their patronage we have but one
recourse left, and that is to drop them
where we found them â in the hands of the
Southern Pacific. We trust all those in
terested will see the point and give us the
support we ask. In return we promise to
stay with our patrons and improve our
service as fast as our means will permit."

FATHER COTTLE
AND ST. BRIDGET'S
How the Parish Has Grown
Under His Guiding
Hand.
NOTED AS A WORKER.
The Late Father Arden Planned
and Built the Present
Edifice.
PROGRESS OF THE NEW CHURCH
Fourteen Hundred Barrels of Cement
Will Be Needed for the Foun
dation Alone.
Father Cottle is a very progressive
man. He is a worker and builder as well
as a preacher. Six years ago the Archbishop
made him pestor of St. Bridget's Church,
corner of Van Ness avenue and Broadway.
It was then burdened with debt, and the
manner in wh ich he swept it away during
his brief pastorate is a matter of history.
That is why the parishioners look upon
Father Cottle as a great worker, and he
always works to a good end ; he plans, he
builds, he accomplishes sometning at
every step.
St. Bridget's parish was established in
1562 by the late Archbishop Alemany.
Father Arden, who died a few days ago at
Benicia , was the first pastor. He was a
Dominican, and for many years guided
the destiny of the parish. Like Father
Cottle he, too, was a builder. The old
church which has been moved to one side
of the lot to make room for the new and
handsome edifice that *ill soon occupy
the site was planned and built by him. It
was constructed in sections.
As the demands of the parish increased
the little church was enlarged. Father
Arden built the altar and confessionals
with his own hands. He also designed the
sanctuary. Being a carpenter himself, he
had no difficulty in executing his plans.
And thus the church was enlarged from
time to time as the parish grew. Strange
to relate, on the very day that Father
Arden passed away at the monastry at
Benicia the old church which he had built
was moved away and began the his
tory of its end.
Father Callaehau, now at San Mateo,
succeeded Father Arden as pastor at St.
Bridget's, and he in turn was succeeded by
Father Birmingham, deceased, who built
the school which adjoins the church and
which is known as St. Bridget's Academy.
It is presided over by the Sisters of Charity
of the Blessed Virgin Mary, an excellent
teaching community from Dubuque, lowa.
There are eleven Sisters on the teaching
staff. They also teach the boys until they
pass into the grammar grade. There are
500 children attending the academy in all.
Father Cottle took charge of the parish
in 1890. He had been educated for this
archdiocese. Father Cottle was born in
New York, but came to California with his
parents in 1862. He received his collegiate
training at St. Mary's College, Oakland,
and took his theological course in the
Grand Seminary, conducted by the Sul
pician fathers at Montreal. He was or
dained in the old Canadian city by the late
Archbishop Fabre in 1879, and came direct
to the California mission.
Father Cottle takes a great pride in his
new church, which, when completed, will
certainly be one of the handsomest
churches in the City. It will be a perfect
gem.
Shea <fe Shea prepared the plans. Father
Cottle said yesterday that he had no hes
itancy in undertaking the work of build
ing the church. Thus far he has superin
tended all the work himself. The excava
tion is now finished and the concrete foun
dation will be laid at once. It will take
1400 barrels of concrete to lay the founda
tion. The concrete foundation for the
tower will be 26 feet square and wiil be 6
feet deep and girded with iron. The tower
will be 120 feet in height. It will have an ob
servatory so that the entire country for
miles around can be seen. The first story, or
basement, will be solid granite and will be
eighteen feet in height. Father Cottle has
already secured the altars which are of
marble and onyx, and the five handsome
Munich windows. The two side sanctua
ries will be miniatures of the main.
The material to be used will be brick
and granite throughout. One of the many
beautiful features of the new church will
be the entrance, which will be through
three grand arches having a span of fif
teen feet. The approach will be by stone
steps rising gradually from the sidewalk
and protected by balustrades. From the
first story to the roof over the center aisle
the height will be forty-five feet and the
eide aisles twenty-five feet from the main
floor of the church. The finish of the in
terior will be after the Italian renaissance.
The nave will be fifty feet wide, and the
walls on either side will be supported by
columns and arches handsomely carved
and ornamented.
The sanctuary will be circular in lorm
and have a depth of thirty feet and a width
of thirty-five feet. The wall over the sanct
uary will have circular windows behind
Romanesque arched colonnades. The whole
arrangement of the interior will be such as
to give an unobstructed view of the altar
from all parts of the church.
SWEET, WHOLESOME WOMEN.
MUs Ktohison Says They Won't Wear
Lone Skirts.
The Socialist Labor party held an enthu
siastic meeting at 909 Market street last
evening.
Mr. Hecht read an extract from a social
ist organ, denying the claim that the So
cialist Labor party is opposed to trades
unionism.
Miss Georgia Etchison read a paper on
"Social Health." "Industry and temper
ance are essentials alike of civic and in
dividual health," said the young lady. "So
insidious have been the advances of civil
and moral disease that we have scarce be
come aware of them. Our newspapers are
a daily epitome of vice and crime."
Commenting upon unhygienic living,
she said : "Our clothing is a caricature of
grace. If you doubt this watch the move
ments of the human animal, encased in his
instrument of torture. Contrast them witn
the wild, free grace of the lower grade of
life.
"In social science we are as yet mere
babes. But there is a hopeful sign in the
rebellion against present conditions. There
has been too fatuous a belief in the great
physicians, God and nature, too little con
tidence in self.
"In my opinion there will be no im
proved condition until our activities are
all in harmony with an awakened social
conscience.
"Cleanliness is no longer to be ranked
as next to godliness, but is cominc to be
recognized as the savior of men. But it is
cleanliness not only of the food we eat and
the water we drink, but the soil we live
on."
Following the line of improvements in
this regard she said: "The time will come
when a woman will not be considered
sweet and wholesome if her skirts reach
the ground. Salutary would be the intro
duction of the cleanly Hollandese fashion
of weekly spring housecleaning."
MARRY EARLY IN LIFE.
Rev. W. H. Moreland AcWlnea Young
Men to Found Homes in
Their Prime,
The Rev. William H. Moreland, rector
of St. Luke's "Church, strongly advises all
young men to get married just as soon as
they can and establish families of their
own.
He spoke to a large audience of young
men yesterday afternoon in the Y. M. C. A.
Hall, his subject being "The Young Man
in Family Life."
Speaking of the sacredness of the home
and the social vaiue of harmonious family
life he declared that divorces and the
proneness of many to resort to them occa
sioned the breaking up of the home and
the shivering asunder of the family, and
he appealed to his auditors to avert* wher
ever it might lie in their power the neces-
sity for a permanent rupture in marital
relations.
There is an artificial standard of society,
he remarked, up to which young men
think they must lire, and in attempting to
do so they let some of the best years of
their life slip by. It is a pity, he con
tinued, that when a man does decide to
wed after leading a gay life the bride comes
in for the last leavings of the bridegroom's
heart, and becomes a mere convenience of
housekeeping.
Next Sunday afternoon's address will be
by the Rev. Dr. John Hemphill of Calvary
Church, and he will talk of "Strong Men."
KNOWN TO ALL TRAMPS
A Man Whose Charitable
Impulses Ruined
Him.
The Old Cigar-Dealer Who Never
Turned a Beggar Away
Empty-Handed.
Instances of charity ruining the donor
are not common in these end-of-the-cen
tury days. Yet such an instance is the
sequel of years of persistent and mistaken |
almsgiving by a man whose name is better ,
known to the itinerant population of this |
country than is that of Collis P. Hunting
ton or even Governor Budd.
F. W. Buxtorff was the proprietor of a
cigar-stand at 423 Sansome street for
twenty-four years. In its palmy days, it is
said, the daily receipts of the little place
were away up in the three figures, and
even, street traditions say, came to the
fourth figure once or twice. But a sad day
came for the old man. That was when
the tramps put him in their blue book.
He had a kind heart and he was credu
lous. Therefore he was an easy prey. As
the visits of the tramps became more fre
quent the simple old cipar-dcaler thought
the fact an indication of the growing
stringency of the times. He\waxed more
liberal than before, and the visits multi
plied in the same ratio. He did not pre
tend to understand this, except that he
began to believe that poverty had inaug
urated a reign of terror. As his custom
began to fall off he ascribed it to this reign
of terror, Wiien his still faithful custom
ers remonstrated against his permitting
tramps to lounge about the place he would
answer in his <weer slow fashion: "Don't
say that. That is not right." When some
one told him he had seen a tramp leave
his place, go rround the corner, change his
coat and hat and go back for a further
levy, he expressed indignation toward the
informant, but not toward the tramp.
No tramp ever went away empty
h anded. The old man came to be known
to the vagrant fraternity from California
to Maine, and when those members of it
who had strayed to the Atlantic slope
wandered back they were sure to pay
Buxtorff a visit â yes. many of them.
The stout figure, the round, good
natured old face, the little wisp of white
hair that stood up straight in the middle
of a shining pate, were all familiar to tiie
fraternity. Tney owed many a drink to
the liberality of the owner.
It was a pfeat blow when they found a
new face at the standâ a face that did not
greet them benignantly, as the rubicund !
old one had done. The news soon went
the rounds that the old man had failed.
He had given his last nickel, and the
Sheriff had closed him out.
The new man had an empty sleeve and
wore a Grand Army button. When the
members of the fraternity put in an ap
pearance he acted with more worldly wis
dom and it was surprising how soon the
visits were discontinued. Now the tramps
who pass look askance at the place.
The lone old man went wearily back to
his lodging at 348 Third street that night
in January when he was surprised by the
summary proceedings of the law. His
courage was gone. He was poorer than
his troop of beneficiaries.
But friends came lorward. Consul Borel,
who had been his landlord, provided the
money to send his countryman back to the
vales of Switzerland. He left a few days
ago, hi* destination the home of a wealthy
sister at Basle.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 23, 1896.
ARMY AND NAVY NOTES
Plan to Place the Pesthouse
on Angel Island Op
posed.
THE PRESIDIO BARRACKS.
Active Work on jGunboat Construc
tionâThe Oregon May Attain
Great Speed.
The suggestion that the Government
should set apart a tract of land on Angel
Island for a pesthouse of San Francisco
has excited opposition in army circles.
It is assumed that Congress following
precedents long established would not
permit such occupation of the island with
out the recommendation of the War De
partment, hence Mayor Sutro has sought
to get a favorble expression from General
Forsyth, commanding the Department of
California. In this he was not successful.
The general contends that the island was
reserved by the Government for military
uses. It is admitted that there is much

land on the island not used now for mili
tary purpose?, but Gen eral Forsyth holds
that military requirements within the
next fifty or even twenty-five years, may
be materially changed, so that the en
tire island may be needed.
Mayor Sutro suggested that the island
was large and that the tract for the use oi
the City could be spared without incon
venience. General Forsyth replied that
the State of California was large and that
j an available site might readily be found
'on the mainland. Again the department
j commander contended that a nesthouse
j should be immediately accessible to and
i placed where it would be under the con
â  stant inspection and supervision of the
health officers of the municipality. If
placed on an island it would be neglected
j and become a nuisa-nce rather than a bene-
I fit. Again, patients de3tined for the hos-
I pital should not be taken from hotels and
j lodging-houses and exposed to a sea voy
i age in order to reach a hospital.
General Forsyth is firmly against the
j proposition, as in his judgment it is
neither a military nor municipal necessity
and therefore will not recommend to the
department at Washington that the res
| ervation shall be used for the purpose in
-1 dicated.
The Quartermaster-General of the Army,
I R. N. Batchelder, recently issued an order
j prohibiting the keeping of domestic ani
! mais or fowls in or near national ceme
j teries for the benefit of the superintendents
i or employes.
To offset the action of the Quarter
j master-General a bill was introduce.! in
J the House of Representatives authorizing
i each superintendent to keep a horse and
! cow for his own use. The House Military
j Committee has favorably reported it, and
I the committee's elaborate report is quite
i animated and sarcastic.
j?irst Lieutenant William W. Galbraith,
Regimental Adjutant, Fifth Artillery, has
returned to duty at the Presidio after pro
; longed leave of absence to recruit his
health.
Lieutenant C. G. Lyman, Second Cav
alry, who is well known in San Franci'.co,
is reported to the board at the Presidio to
be examined for promotion. /
Lieutenant Harry A. Smith, First In
fantry, Benicia Barracks, has been de
tailed by the War Department to instruct
the National Guard of Kansas. Mr. Smith
went to the Military Academy from "Bleed
ing Kansas," and hence his tour of duty,
with headquarters at Topeka, will bring
him into fellowship witli old friends.
Upon the recommendation of the chief
surgeon of the department First Lieuten
ant Paul F. Straub, assistant surgeon, has
been ordered to report to General Graham
at the Presidio for duty at that post until
the arrival of Major Robert H. White,
surgeon.
The following paragraph from Special
Order No. 29, headquarters Department of
California, is interesting :
.3. Under provisions of Circular No. 16.
dated War Department, Adjutant General's Of
fice, December 8, 1892, Private Bamuel Smith,
Company E, First Infantry, Angel Island, Cal
ifornia, will be sent to Hot Springs, Arkansas
to enable him to enter the Army and Navy
General Hospital at that point, reporting, upon
his arrival, to the commanding officer. The
Commanding Officer, Angel Island, will for
ward the descriptive list and account of pay
and clothing of the patient, by mail, prior to
his departure fÂ«wn the post. In event of the
patient betnur unable to walk, he will be gap
plied with an official telegram prepared to be
sent from St. Louis, notifying the commanding
officer of the hospital of the time the train
leaves that station, in order that transporta
tion may be sent to meet him at railroad depot
at Hot Springs.
The Qnartermaster's Department will furnish
the necessary transportation, and the Subsist
ence Department commutation of rations, in
advance, at the prescribed rale, lor the neces
sary number of days, it being impracticable
for him to carry rations of any kind.
The journey is necessary for the public
service.
The third double brick barracfc building
at the Presidio has been completed and
will be occupied this week by Light Bat
teries D and Fof the Fifth Artillery. The
six batteries of the regiment stationed at
the Presidio are now supplied with com
fortable and spacious quarters, containing
man\ r modern conveniences. In the next
three weeks Colonel A. S. Kirn ball, Chief
Quartermaster of the department, will in
vite proposals for contracts for construct
ing the new stables at the .Presidio. An
expenditure of $14,000 has been authorized
for this purpose.
During the past month a vast quantity
of material from the East has been re
ceived by the "Union Iron Works to be
used in trie construction of the two new
gunboats. Work on the boats is actively
progressing and will be pushed ahead un
til the launching.
Activity is the order aboard the battle
ship Oregon. Workmen are busy with in
terior equipments, adjusting electric con
nections, extending tubes and doing a
thousand little things that must be done
before the trial trip is made. The system
provided for lighting the great ship is said
to be excellent. The dynamos have been
tested, but the battleship has not yet been
illuminated.
Irving M. Scott is confident that the
Oregon will display on the trial trip speed
in excess of the contract requirement.
THE FRENCH HOSPITAL
Annual Meeting to Discuss Pro
posed Amendments to the
By-Laws.
Out of the Sixteen Submitted All Were
Voted Down With the Excep
tion of Two.
The annual meeting of the French Be
nevolent Society was held in Union-square
Hall, fost street, yesterday afternoon to
discuss the amendments to the by-laws
submitted at the preparatory meeting held
two weeks ago.
The ball was crowded, and great interest
war manifested in the proceedings. Syl
vain Weill, president, occupied the chair
and called the meeting to order.
There were sixteen proposed amend
ments to the by-laws and all were voted
down, with the exception of two. Among
the fourteen rejected was the amendment
to amalgamate the offices of resident physi
cian and superintendent at the French
Hospital, which was not even discussed.
The first amendment to the by-laws
adopted was in regard to the board of direc
tors. The board at present consists of fif
teen, elected annually. The amendment
adopted was to the effect that at the com
ing election in two weeks fifteen should be
elected, but next year and every year
thereafter ten of the number shall only re
tire, leaving five of the old bourd in office,
and only ten new directors to be elected.
This was considered an important change,
as the live leftin office would be conversant
with the business done the previous year.
The other amendment adopted related
to doctors eligible for election. According
to the by-laws doctors allowed to bold
office were only those who had already
Herved the society and those who â  had
graduated from some medical college re
quiring not less than a four years' course
of study. Having found that* this restric
tion was an injustice to a number of prac
titioners.wtio, previous to 1892, had gradu
ated from colleges requiring only a three
years' course of study, but whicn since
then had increased the course to four
years, the amendment now permits tnem
to run for office.
The election of officers will be held on
Sunday, April 5, and nominations will be
received up to sp. m. next Saturday. Yes

PURPOSE OF THE A.P. A.
Rev. Dr. Ray Palmer Replies to
Some Criticisms on the
Organization.
ITS PLANS CLEARLY DEFINED.
I
Incidentally the Speaker Declared His
Hearty Belief in the Innocence
of Dr. Brown.
At the Good Citizenship meeting yester
day afternoon at Metropolitan Hall Rev.
Dr. Ray Palmer made the address of the
day. There was a full auditorium pres
ent. Before Dr. Palmer took the rostrum
Chairman Quitzow, after asserting that he
wished to prove to the audience that the
Roman Catholic Church was in poli
tics, stated that at the German Catholic
Church on Golden Gate avenue, between
Jones and Leavenworth streets, there were
circulated notices referring to the "damna
ble American Protective Association" as
being subversive of liberty, and instruct
ing them to vote for the list of men sub
mitted in the notice, who were declared to
be the best men selected from the tickets
of the various partiesâ men who were in
favor of liberty.
Dr. Palmer spoke on the subject of
"Criticism of the A. P. A.'s" He said :
"I believe that the American Protective
Association has a right to live. I believe
that if our flag has a rieht to live, if the
American Government has a right to live,
if the public school has a right to live, if
free speech and free thought have a right
to live, then we claim that the American
Protective Association has the right to
Jive."
He stated that wrong reports were again
about concerning the American Protective
Association to the effect that it was en
gaged in a religious war. This he denied,
and added that every member of the
American Protective Association was
reaiiy to-day to take up arms in defense
of the rights of the weakest anu smallest
sect to worship as it pleases. He declared
that the Roman Catholic churrh was not
being fought on account of its religion,
but on account of its interference in
politics.
Among other things he disclaimed that
the movement was one of preachers.
"Preachers, " he continued, "are no good
these days, anyway. They are getting into
all sorts of trouble. They have to protect
themselves in every way nowadays, even
to locking their doors so that the ladies
cannot come to see them.
"Now, I don't want my words construed
to be directed against Dr. Brown. So far
as I am concerned I believe from the bot
tom of my heart that Dr. Brown is an in
nocent man. He is the victim of a con
spiracy organized for the destruction of
his life and soul. I do not know Dr.
Brown. I met him but once, and am not
a member of his church. The troop of
liars who have appeared against nim is
something I have never before seen, but
he wiil live to see his enemies dead. He
will yet live to be a great man and a
preacher, just the same as Beecher was."
Partisanship, he declared, was no part of
the plan of the American Protective Asso
ciation. All that it wanted, he said, was
to see the men in office who were for pure
and true Americanism. He also refuted |
the statements that the members of the j
American Protective Association were i
made up of foreigners â Orangemen, Irish, i
Dutch and others. "Half of those who j
criticize us in this particular," he said, j
"can't speak the English language to save
their necks."
He thanked the City press for their re
ports of the meetings in San Francisco and
added that the country press were bitterly
opposed to the movement. Then he con
tinued:
But we find a great deal of difficultyj in pe.t
ting the business man into our ranks. They
say they believe in cur principles, but they will
not join our organization. And we find this
particularly so among the Jews. They think
only of their business and of the dollars and
cents view of it. Their only thought is to
make money.
The Irish claim that they are peculiarly fit
ted for politics, and that that is the reason
they occupy so many or our public oflices. But
it is now time for them to look for some other
occupation, for the American people are about
to take steps to prove that they, too, are pecu
liarly fitted for politics.
We do not propose to resort to force to con
vert the. Roman Catnolics to our way of think
ing, unless they force us to do so, but we pro
pose to keep this country Protestant now and
forever.
The speaker then spoke in eulogy of the
public schools and of the gieat need of
constantly inculcating into the rising gen
eration the principles of liberty and love
of country.
Spain was denounced for her action in
opposing the efforts of Cuba to secure her
independence and the liberty of her people.
He referred to a prophecy of a Catholic
publication, which declared that fifty years
from now the children of the members of
the American Protective Association would
all be good Catholics. He added that he
would also like to make a prophecy, and
continued :
I want to prophesy that fifty years from now
there will be no Pope at Rome. Fifty years
hence the hierarchy will be numbered among}
the relics of the past. In fifty years from to- !
day models of monasteries and" nuneries will !
be on exhibition to show what awful things j
have been. There will not be a single oid j
bachelor priest on this continent or on any
other continent. The priests will all be mar
ried men. There will not be a nun living as
nuns live to-day. I have not one word to say
against thes<>. women, for many of them lead
the highest kind of life and do much in the
way of good, but fifty years hence they will all
be married to the best men they can find.
Fifty years from now every child will be taught
to properly honor the stars and stripes, and
in our public buildings will be hung banners
inscribed, "In honor of the immortal deeds of
the A. P. A."
DR. YORK'S LECTURE.
An Exposition of the Pedigrees of
Freethought and of tho Free
thinkers.
Dr. J. L. York, the liberal orator, enter
tained a Jarge audience at Scottish Hall
last evening on the subject of "The Evo
lution of Modern Freethought and Free
thinker?," upon which he spoke substan
tially as follows:
As liberals, "Whence did we come? And
whiher are we tending as a fore* in the worid
of mind?" While it is important to know onr
origin and relations in this world as physical
beiugs it is quite as important to know where
we came from, where we are tending, and
our relations as mental and moral beings.
The evolution of free thought and mental
liberty in the world is simply the growth and
unfoldrneut of the human intellect in the light
of experience, reason and natural science.
All nature is made of one stuff and governed
by the same law of inherent conditions, and
the human mind, like all things else, grows by
what it feeds upon. If it feed upon mystery,
fiction and fable it will grow up sickly and
full of superstition; but if it be nourished by
the sunshine of fact, history and natural
science, it will unfold on a higher plane of
truth, true spirituality and moral life.
The modern era of liberalism was opened up
in 1600 by the new astronomy of Copernicus,
Galileo and Kepler; the new philosophy of
Descartes, Spinoza and Bacon, and the new
literature of Luther, Montigne and Shakes
peare.
These were the fathers of modern freet hough t
and the freethinkers of to-day are the children
of this illustrious parentage.
We trace the riso of modern freethought to
Lord Herbert, one of the most accomplished
men of England, who wrote a book entitled
"The Truth," in or about 1600. The book was
soon condemned, and only a few copies of It
have survived tha religious prejudice of the
times. It was in England alone, and to her
glory be it said, that the light of the new truth
could be kep*. burning at all. And in that
land of the rommon law, jury trial, changing
faiths, and rising printing press, the line of
the martyrs and confessors of modern free
thought began, and from that central line of
thicken and reformers has radiated, as from
a central sun, the streams of mental liberty, all
over Europe and America.
We need not recall to your minds the names
of HoDbs, Shaftsbary, Toland, Collin?, Tyndfl.ll
and Wooiston (poor man dying in prison for
truth), on down, to Lord Boungbroke, the
worthy successor of Lord Herbert, the author
of the little work mentioned as the starting
point of English liberalism. â¢ .
From this same liberal school of thought
came the French Voltaire and the Englisn
Pope, whence followed that of D'Holbach,
Volney, the Encyclopedia, Rousseau, Damon
and the great French Revolution with its im
mense social and political changes. ....
From ttis fountainhead all of the liberal
streams of thought have descended into Scot
land through Hume, and into Germany b>
Emanuel Kant, and through Adam Smith into
the commercial world at large, and tnus re
lish liberalism has found Us way into ail
America is full of promise for the future.
When we began to lecture Iwenty-eight years
ago an audience couid not be obtained except
iv a few. places on this coast. Now at this time
almost every town, city and rountry school
district will afford a good audience to listen
to the gospel of reason and common sense.
Man and woman to the front, and the church
and priest to the rear, is the American watch
word of free thought. But while it is true
that Protestant Christianity in its oogmatic
aspect is dying out, Romanism aud her pa
rochial schools are a menace to our American
free institutions and our great cities are rap
idly falling under the iniiuence of ccclesiaÃti
cism. And the time has come when every lib
eral minded man should set his face against
the domination of the State aud schools by
any religious sectarian influence whatever.
But as we have said, the religion of our
country has advanced and is growing more
humane, thanks to the noble workers on
American soil, such as Henry C. Wright, Parker
Pilsbury, Theodore Parker, Stephen Foster,
Lucretia Mott.Eliezer Wright, Lloyd Garrison,
Wendell Phillips, Gerrh Smith, I). M. Bennette,
K. G. lngersoll aud a host of others who have
lived and died iv the cause of mental ireedom.
And the trend of modern freethought shows
most clearly the decay of superstition. Ihe
great majority of thinking men no longer even
affect a religious faith in the old meaning of
these terms, and the new woman will have
very little religion of the old stamp. What
influence has the clergy to-day, compared witn
the past? The average thinker in the pews to
day pushes the pulpit.
What power has the church to-day compared
with 100 years ago? The thinking world are
sliding away from religious faith, dogmas and
technical theology and have opened the ques
tion of creeds and priestly rule, showing the
decadence of religion in Jhe exact ratio as the
spread of education and growth of natural sci
ence in the world.
Religious faith and dogma are no longer the
mighty moral force they once were in both
Europe and America. The spread of education
anri knowledge among the people has Daral
yzed religion as a controlling moral force.
Thus the shackles of creed are breaking and a
new faith will inspire mankind with the
simple and practical religion of Honesty, Be
nevolence and Morality.

LET EZETA`S GUIS PASS
The President of Salvador Calls
It a Ridiculous Ex
pedition.
A Conquest and a General Suspense
at Panamaâ Salvador Im
proving.
The President of the Republic of Salva
dor seems to thinK that General Ezeta'a
cruise of conquest, that started originally
from San Francisco, is nothing more than
a joke with the lau<jh pretty much on the
belligerent general who, he declares, has
been abandoned by the Barclay Golden
and left to strike out for parts unknown.
In a letter received by Friday's steamer,
President Gutierrez thus expresses him
self:
Sr. Dr. Eustorqio Calderon, Cnnnul del Salvador
en San Francisco, Cat.â Esteemed Sir: I re
ceived your last letter of the 27th of January.
General Antonio Ezeta is still at Panama,
whence it is probable he will take passage in
another steamer for parts unknown, foi I un
derstand that the captain of the Barclay
Golden has resolved to have nothing more to
do with him or with Casin, and will leave
them on land.
The authorities of Acapulco allowed three
boxes of rifles and fifteen boxes of cartridges
that were on board the Barclay Golden to con
tinue in transit because Casin offered proof
j that they were freighted direct to Panama,
j and so I did not insist that these things be con
fiscated by the authorities on account of the
little importance, or, more properly speaking
| the ridiculous nature of the expedition.
I remain, as ever, your attentive servant,
R. A. GitierreZ.
By the same mail came a copy of the
President's recent message to the Salva
dorean Congress.
In it he congratulates the people upon
the economic and commercial improve
ments throughout the republic during the
past year, upon the existing peace, the
final union 01 long: separated parties, the
increased efficiency of the press published
by the Government and delivered free to
the people, and upon the equipment and
extension of asylums.

The Pastor Talks of the
Sufferings of the
Earthy.
THANKS LADY FRIENDS.
A Big Crowd Turns Out to
Hear the Minister De
fend Himself.
HIS OPPONENTS AT WORK.
â¢
Meeting to Be Held To-Night to De
termine a Line of Procedure.
Fifty Names Added.
Rev. Dr. C. O. Brown preached yester
day morning on Job, the much-afflicted of
Biblical days, incidentally drawing a paral
lel that was more or less obvious to the
large congregation of curiosity mongers,
including some church members.
When Sexton Pike, grim and ugly look
ing as in council days, but withal pleasant
if rubbed the right way,- threw open the
big folding doors of the First Congrega
tional Church yesterday he found a score
or more of Pastor Brown's feminine
friends impatiently awaiting a mode of
entrance. Without formality they rushed
for the front seats, and when the general
sightseers came in later they found the
first three or four rows thickly occupied.
From then on until 11 o'clock there was
a constant stream of visitors, which more
than filled the upper and lower floors of
the auditorium, when the great organ
thundered forth its initiatory notice that
the service had begun.
Deacons Morse and Dewing came early.
One stood on the right and the other on
the left of the main entrance, and as fast
as the sightseers came, the doors were
opened and they were given seats regard
less of the rights of church members or
pew-holders, and ordinarily such confusion
might have been disastrous, but with such
a motley crowd it made very little or no
difference. As a matter of fact they might
well have thought themselves among the
chosen.
Mr. Woodhams, he of judge-advocate
fame, resumed his old-time position of
usher. Deacon Barnard was escorted to
his old seat by the ex-judge-advocate, and
ater Trustee Merrill was shown the same
ourtesy. Deacon Hatch walked down the
aisle unaccompanied, but experienced no
difficulty in locating his rightful pew.
Neither Mrs. Cooper nor her friends were
present at the morning service. "While
there were probably 1000 people in attend
ance it was said that not exceeding one
tenth of this number were members of the
church.
It was a varied gathering, theoretical in
appearance and cynical by virtue of its
cosmopolitan aspect.
Many people came to see and hear Dr.
Charles Oliver Brown, not because they
hr.ieved in him, but that they were most
anxious to behold a man who dared to
<i-.IV his fellow-churches.
1 Here were old men and women, young
dames and misses, little children and
babies in the vast throng. Mrs. fezanik
and her adopted foundling were not pres
ent.
Just as the organ prelude sounded Dr.
Brown and Profesaor Lloyd marched into
the pulpit. The former was a trifle pale,
though his eye had lost none of that
wonted brilliancy or his step that familiar
firmness. He came proudly, boldly, and
it might be said, a little defiantly.
There was nothing about him to indicate
a, man crouched or bowed with sorrow.
He seemed impressed then and later with
his temporary power, and never at any
time during the exercises did he loosen
his grasp on the situation.
Professor Lloyd read a brief lesson from
the Old Testament, during which Pastor
Brown busied himself toying with the sev
eral notes pinned to the floral offer
ings which surrounded him, and una
ble finally to get tbem off, he contented
himself with playing a tattoo on the arms
of the chair and incidentally casting wist
ful glances on tne little billet doux.
Dr. Brown then followed in a lengthy
prayer in which he figuratively traveled
around the earth, ending up with asking
for a blessing on friends and foes alike.
He made a special appeal for the press
representatives, indicating that, whatever
the failures of the past may have been, he
hoped the future would see them rightly
guided.
Following this came the usual announce
ments for the succeeding week. At the
Wednesday night prayer-meeting several
withdrawals from the church are to be
acted on, and ope or two possible expul
sions indulged in. The case of Mrs. Stock
ton will be disposed of at that time, and it
is also hinted that an attempt will be made
Some of the Ladies of Dr. Brown's Congregation Admiring the Sweet Blossoms and Tender Green
Plants With Which They Had Decorated His Pulpit for the Services Yesterday.
[Sketched by a "Call * artist.]
to bring Mrs. Cooper under church disci
pline as interpreted by Dr. Brown, Attor
ney Nagle ana Deacon Morse.
Dr. Brown then led off with his remarks
on Job and himself, prefacing the whole
with the following:
"I should have something less than the
heart of a man if I did not notice these
tokens which surround me" (speaking
of the floral offerings of Mrs. .Rogers
and others). "Before beginning my ser
mon I wish to express my heartfelt thanks
to those whose hands have wrought these
things. Ido not take it especially to my
self, but as a tribute to God.
"I want also to thank the 100, nay 1000
or more friends who by letter or otherwise
have expressed their faith in me."
Dr. Brown then proceeded with his ser
mon, telling how it came about that Job
made use of the expression, "I know that
my redeemer liveth." Throughout the en
tire discourse he carefully avoided any di
rect reference to his own troubles, but by
inuendo and otherwise he let his hearers
into the secret that Job was a much less
afflicted person than himself.
When these comparisons were made the
pastor invariably introduced a beautiful
tearless tremor with telling effect.
Dr. Brown and his friends have not
endeared themselves to the majority of
the congregation by inaugurating a kind
of praise service immediately after the
sermon, thereby forcing Mrs. Cooper to
seek other quarters for her Bible class.
This oiove had been anticipated, how
ever, by Mrs. Cooper, and a rich friend of
hers secured Stanford Parlor, Native Sons'
building, where the Bible class to the num
ber of over 100 went through the regular
lesson.
Deacon Morse and Pastor Brown vied
with each other for such honors as came
from the "praise service," which ended
about the time the Bible class usually
closes.
Dr. Brown was in excellent humor with
himself yesterday. He was highly pleased
with the morning service, and professes to
believe that the opposition to him received
a death blow.
Every seat in the church was occupied
last nisht before the prelude of the organ.
Dr. Brown spoke on the theme, "The
Spirit of Friendship."
He took for the appropriate Scripture
the Old Testament classic, the story of the
friendship of David and Jonathan.
Throughout his sermon he drew illustra
tions from this tale of true friendship.
"Friendship, 1 ' said he, "is indispensable
to the human creature. The proudest and
most arrogant man, who is seemingly in
dependent of the entire world, is really
Helplessly dependent on his lowest me
nial."
As an example he drew the picture of
one in a strange city where he sees no
friendly face, and he quoted Bacon's say
ings, "This world is a wilderness to him
who has no friend," and also "Friendship
maketh a fair day."
"Real friendship," continued the
speaker, "is not so plentiful that any one
of us can afford to scorn the smallest
showing of it. The basis of all true friend
ship must lie in some similarity in tastes,
and I grant also some contrasts. There
i must be something magnanimous; some-
J thing truly large and broad; something
I that can appreciate and see the great
! stream of life.
"Men can see spots on the sun and yet
forget that they are dependent on the sun
for light. It is easy to clasp hands in pros
perity and when each may benefit the
other, and say 'Let us be friends.'
"The tests of friendship never come
through the noon-time of prosperity, the
| tests come in the midnight of adversity.
! While the purse lasts, while the latch
j string is out and while the banquet groans
I with the hospitable feast, it -is easy to be a
friend. But when the sun is darkened a
little, when the purse is empty and the
table bare then it is not easy to be a friend.
"True friendship proceeds upon the sup
position of human frailty. It does not
look for perfection in the object of its love,
for it knows it has no perfection to proffer
in return.
"Friendship will overlook the shafts of
petty criticism when the object of its love
is sore beset. Friendship proceeds upon
j confidence â confidence, that plant of such
slow growth and whose stem is so easily
broken.
"True friendship proceeds upon charity.
Charity is life â charity of act, charity of
judgment â and yet it is a hard thingun
less you possess true charity, to put your
self in your friend's place before you pass
judgment upon him."
At the close of the sermon Dr. Brown
said:
"I desire to say a few words to my
friends â friends that have stood by me in.
my days of trial. And I desire to thank
them for their friendship which my own
trials have been unable to break.
'I shall never forget the testimonial of
one of the Hebrew race whom I had not
known before. It strengthened me more
than I can express. And also I wish to
speak of a Roman Catholic who has been
to me more than a brother.
"I recognize I have given occasion in the
past to provoke their prejudice because of
my words uttered against that great
church. It has been a wonderful revela
tion to me that they have stayed by me,
even when deserted by almost all the
world. I have undergone an entire revo
lution in thinking in these days of suffer
ing."
Home fifty additional names were secured
yesterday to the petition asking the board
of trustees to secure another minister.
This makes 150 signatures all told.
Those having the matter in charge will
meet at the office of Dr. McDonald, Colum
bian building, to-night.
Colonists for California.
Twenty-nine colonists, including three mar
ried couples and eighteen children, arrived yes
terday from lowa and Montana and took apart
ments at the Russ. They will leave in a day
or two for Eden Valley Colony, where they will
make their homes. One of the couples, J. Jenk
lich and wife, bring nine children with them,
with several precincts more to hear from.

an immense affair. The members are practic
ing daily for the performance. There will be
new songs and gags, most of them prepared for
the occasion.
In the first part the end men will be Peter
Stone. Robert Mitchell, Jameg Swinnerton and
Alex Rosborough. William Hallett will be in
the center, and will also sing. The other
singers will include the Cathcart brothers,
David McLaughlin, the Plymouth Quartet,
Frank Coffin (leader) and Finney and Morel.
In the olio Swinnerton will draw his sketches
on the stage, McLaughlin will give a German
act, Alfred yon Bandeladen of San Jose will
in female impersonation, Cathcart and Mitchell
in specialties, and there will be gymnastic acts
by members of the Olympic Club.
There will also be a grand chorus by the
Olympic Club members and a number of other
acts which are now being arranged. The audi
torium will be specially decorated, and as the
object is a most meritorious one and the en
tertainment promises to be an excellent one,
the house will undoubtedly be crowded.
Society in the Mission is deeply interested
in the coming National Peasants' Fete to be
given at Mission Opera Hall on April 9, 10 and
11 for the benefit of Trinity Presbyterian
Church. About one hundred young ladies will
take part in characters. The ladies of Trinity
Presbyterian Church, assisted by ladies from
other churches have the affair in charge, and
it promises to be one of the events of the
season.

LITTLE TIME LEFT.
The Best Opportunity to Obtain a Dic
tionary Will Soon BÂ« L,ost.
The Pacific Coast Newspaper Syndicate
has opened headquarters at 36 Montgom
ery street for the distribution of a great
work. The Encyclopaedic Dictionary is
there to be seen, and can be obtained on
the marvelously small terms of $1 cash
and $1 25 per month for one year. At the j
end of that period the lucky purchaser
will be in possession of an unequaled work
in four superb volumesâ the cheapest and
best in the market.
But the intending buyers must be
prompt, for only the first 500 full sets are
being distributed. These undoubtedly
will soon be bought up, and then there
will be repentance on the part of the
tardy, but no more dictionaries except at
$42, which is the original subscription
price at which the volumes were made to
sell.
Inquiries by mail are pouring in day by
day, and those eager to ascertain the par
ticulars of this greatest die ionary offer
will understand that it is only press of
overwork that prevents their queries being
answered. Little time is now left and the
opportunity to obtain the Encyclopaedic
Dictionary, the finest OHI3 kind, will soon
be a thing of the past.
MERCHANTS DETERMINED
Pen a Letter of Quiet Sarcasm
to the City Hall Com
missioners.
They Express a Willingness to Stand
the Expense of the City Hall
Directory.
The action on the part of the Board of
City Hall Commissioners in questioning
the validity of the Supervisors' authority
to grant the merchants the fitting up of a
directory in the new City Hall has aroused
a deal of sarcasm in the Merchants' Asso
ciation, which was yesterday precipitated
in the following letter:
San Francisco, March 21, 1896.
To the Honorable, the Boo,rd of New City Hall
Commissioners â Gentlemen: The necessity of a
concise yet complete directory and index to
the offices ana departments of the new City
Hall is fully recognized by every person hav
ing occasion to go to the City Hall. The diffi
culty in finding the various offices in that,
large structure has been experienced not only*
by visitors to the building, but also by its oc
cupants. It is a daily occurrence to see parties
hunting along its dark corridors and question
ing on all sides, in vain search for certain
courts or olliciais.
Believing that this long-felt want in the
City Hall should be supplied without further
delay, the board of directors of the Merchants'
Association has given this matter most careful â¢
consideration. Six mopths ago the engineer
of this association was Instructed to prepare
plans and specifications for the work. After
much deliberation <atfsfactorv plans were
finally prepared, and, together with full speci
fications and estimates, presented to your hon
orable board last January. Although this as
sociation offered, if necessary, to bear the en
tire expense of the work, a majority of your
board would not consent to any plan being
placed in the new City Hall until the final
completion of that building.
Over twenty years have already been con
sumed in the construction of the new City
Hall; and, according to your last report, as
published in the Municipal Keports of 1894
--95, the "total expenditure and cost of the new
City Hall to July 1, 1895," reached the almost
incredible sum of $5,221,243 17. Turning to
the official report of the architect of your board
dated February 12, 1895, upon the
cost of the completion of the bunding," a
specified list is submitted of all the necessary
work, amounting to $316,000 additional,
to complete the new City Hali. Yet, among
all the items enumerated, no reference is even
made to any directory or index for that build
ing.
Assuming that the new City Hall may be
completed and turned over to the Board of
Supervisors within a year, we still firmly be
lieve that the positive benefit derived from a
simple directory in the building would more
than warrant the insignificant expenditure of
$121 and the occasional outlay of a few dol
lars in altering the plans to meet any possible
changes in the offices. Moreover, we respect
fully contend that after spending nearly
$6,000,000 upon their new City Hall, the
weary and patient taxpayers of San Fran
cisco would willing endure the extra $121 to
be safely guided through its many labyrinths.
No private office building of any magnitude
anywhere is without the plans of a directory
at its entrance and along its corridors. Xo de
sirable tenant would care to have an office in a
building without such a necessary directory.
Ana yet the new City Hall, supposed to repre
sent the public offices of over 300,000 people,
has been for years without auy means of as
sistance to guide the citizens of the City in
their constant visits to their great municipal
temple.
Under sach circumstances the Merchants '
Association decided to submit the question
directly to the City Fathers. The Committee
on Public Buildings at once most cheerfully
recommended the work, and the Board of
Supervisors on the 16th inst. unanimously ac
cepted the plans, specifications and estimate
of this association for introducing this neces
sary directory into the new City Hall. The
authorization of the Board of Supervisors has
been received, empowering the Merchants'
Association to execute the work at a cost of
not over $125. At the regular meeting of the
board of directors of the association, held yes
terday morning, a report was received from
the chairman on Public Buildings of the
Board of Supervisors that one of your mem
bers, as City Attornsy, intended to raise the
question of the validity of The authorization,
and the other as Auditor would probably re
iuse to audit the demand.
As to the possibility of the latter event, it
will not prevent or delay the work, for this
association is willing, if necessary, to defray
the entire expense. As to the validity of the
action of the Board of Supervisors, it appeared
to us that the proposed directory being in no
way a part of the City Hall building itself, but
rather a movable fixture, just like, for in
stance, the pictures now hanging in the
Mayor's office of the previous illustrious
Mayors of this City, we made a mistake in the
beginning by going before your honorable
board regarding this directory. We believe
that we only corrected our error in addressing
ourselves subsequently to the Board of Super
visors upon this subject. Nevertheless, if our
efforts in this direction result in nothing more
than a certain determination as to who is
resDonsible for the long delay in providing
such a directory, something useful will have
been accomplished and our efforts will not
have been in vain.
We cannot seriously believe, however, that
your honorable board really intends to inter
fere to the extent of excluding this directory
system from the new City Hall at the present
time. But as there seems to be a question
about the authority to do so and your inten
tions in the matter, we respectfully ask tor
your views and wishes before going to an ex
pense, which would be wasted if the use of the
proposed directory should be successfully pre
vented. Very respectfully yours.
Merchants' Association.
F. W. Dohbhann, President.
J. Richard Freud, Secretary.
Pawned Her Bracelet.
Mrs. Nellie Hendrickson, 338 Eddy street,
swore out a warrant on Saturday for the arrest
of John Ellis, a friend of hers, on the charge of
obtaining goods by false pretenses. She alleges
that Ellis told her that his brother Charles had
been arrested and needed money to get him
out of prison. She gave him a gold bracelet
with nine diamonds in it which he pawned.
She afterward learned that Charles had not
been arrested and that John had appropriated
the money on the bracelet to his own purposes.
She also secured a search warrant
REALTY MARKET REVIEW
Considerable Activity Promised
in the Building
Line.
STRUCTURES HOW UNDER WAY
Some Choice Properties to Be Sold
at Auctionâ Record of
the Week.
Building operations for the present year
promise to exceed those of 1895 to a con
siderable extent. While the totals of the
recorded contracts do not indicate any
NOE VALLEY LOOKING EAST FROM ELIZABETH AND VIEW AVENUES.
great degree of activity in building, an
enumeration of a few of the principal
structures to be erected this year will be
conclusive evidence that 1896 will be a
particularly lively year with builders and
in the building trades.
The new ferry depot building will be
well along toward completion before the
close of the present year, and it is quite
probable that the contracts will be let and
a good deal of work accomplished this year on
the Affiliated Colleges building, as well as the
new Criminal Court building, to be erected on
Kearny street, on the old City Hall site.
In addition to the ioregolng a number of
business blocks will be built this year/work on
which in nearly all instances has already been
commenced. Among the principal ones are
the following:- The building being erected by
the Hobart estate on Post street, near Stock
ton, which is to cost $70,000; the six-story
structure that is to be put upon the site occu
pied by the old American ' Exchange Hotel,
which will.' cost In the neighborhood of
$75,000; a 6ix-story building on Darts street,
near Sacramento, is to be erected by J. H. Fol
ger, the cost of which will be $50,000 ; an ad
diiion to the Royal House on Ellis street is to
be built this year by Jacob Frowenfeldt ana
will cost $35,000; while the Union Iron Works
is going to erect a new office building that will
cost about $30,000.
The work on the superstructure of The
Call building will be concluded this year, and
considerable progress will be made in the fin
ishing before the Ist of January next. In ad
dition to this the coming season promises a
number of email business buildings, as well
as a great many residences, flats, etc.
The resumption of building operations to
such aB extent cannot but act favorably on
the real estate market, and the good effects
are even now being felt. It is found that new
houses and flats rent readily, and for this rea
son many owners of vacant lots are taking ad
vantage oi the present low cost of building
materials to erect houses and other structures,
with the assurance, practically in advance,
of having tenants to occupy them upon com
pletion.

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES.
Will E. Fisher has purchased the interest of
his partner, Henry A. Smith, and will conduct
the business alone, without any change, how-
ever, in the firm name. Mr. Smith, who has
not been in good health for some time, con
templates an extended trip abroad.
A. H. Quatman of this City has just closed a
large deal in Los Angeles, having purchased
for a San Francisco syndicate 100 acres of
land in that city from the Briswalter Land
and Water Company. The tract will be sub
divided into 500 lots and placed upon the mar
ket as soon as it is improved.
The well-known Hale ranch at Mountain
View, Santa Clara County, consisting of 1700
acres is being offered for sale by McGlynn &
Menton. It has a large vineyard, three prune
orchards and fruit trees of all kinds, while the
improvements consist of a neat house, large
barns and other buildings.
Stenberg & Co. last week succeeded in effect
ing a sale of the famous Maison Doree restau
rant on Kearny street. The consideration was
$6000 and the purchaser is H. May, formerly
proprietor of the Winchester House.
A gratifying Indication of the progress and
development of San Francisco is the rapid
growth of the City's suburbs. No better illus
tration of the work being done in this direc
tion can be found than in what is known as
Noe Valley. Four years ago there was not an
improvement in that locality, while now the
place is dotted with substantial residences as
can be seen from the accompanying illustra
tion. At the present rate of building a few
more years will find nearly every lot covered
with improvements.
A. M. Speck & Co. have effected a three
years' lease for G. O. Davis of the premises 322
Ellis street at $325 per month. The lessee is
Mrs. Julia Calhoun, who will open the place

"THE NEW MAN."
Key. William Rader or the Third Con
gregational Church Preaches
on Him.
At the Third Congregational Church
Rev. William Rader preached last even
ing on "The New Man," taking his text
from Ephesians iv :24. He' said :
â¢'There has always been a new man. He
has been the best man of his times, who
has lived in advance of accepted standards.
He has been the pioneer of history, the
leader of thought and the inspiration of
great action. Man is finding himself, and
in finding himself is discovering God, im
mortality and the race consciousness.
Milton exclaimed, 'Myself am Hell! '
' 'The new man may or may not believe in
the new woman. She has not a monopoly
of him. He may or may not accept' the
doctrines of the new womanhood. He
will be a gentleman, the most misunder
stood man in American society. Conven
tionalism without conscience "has robbed
this gracious word of its meaning. He will
be useful rather than ornamental. Greece
believed in beauty, America in the useful.
The new man will not be the incarnation
of well-dressed lazinesÃ.
"In the pew man character will be cul
ture and common- sense the social certifi
cate. The most dangerous sham is the
man who has learning without wisdom
and culture without character. The no
ble man is always the good man.
"He will not be an improvement, but a
creation. God does not improve people,
but creates them anew. The molds of
the immortal characters are broken. The
new man is to be broken in righteousness
and true holiness. Christianity is a crea
tive force and the new man is to be Chris
tian. With his advent will appear the
new politics and the new Jerusalem.
"Before we see the golden age we shall
see the golden man. He shall anticipate
the new America. The dnty of every man
is to get out of his old self into the new
mannood created in righteousness. Every
man may be a new man if he will."

ANOTHER PIONEER GONE
John Wilmot Farren Died Yes
terday After an Illness
of Two Weeks.
One of the Oldest Merchants and
Public Msn in the City.
An Ex-Supervisor.
John Wilmot Farren, one of San Fran
cisco's oldest and most respected citizens,
died at his residence, 500 Harrison street,
last evening after an illness of two weeks.
J . W. Farren came from Boston in the ship
Reindeer, arriving here on April 2, 1850.
Upon his arrival he started for the mines,
and after a short experience at mining he
returned to San Francisco and entered the
wagon-making business, with which he
was more familiar. The firm name in 1850
was Farren & Clapp, and their store wa3
located on the corner of Market and First
streets, then known as Happy Valley.
Here he continued for a number of
years, until he removed to his present
place of business, 121 Beale street. He
wa9 one of the organizers of the Mechan
icr' Institute, and, being a mechanic him
self, took great interest in that institution.
He was one of the organizers of thft
American Bank and Trust Company, and
at the time of his death was one of its di
rectors.
In 1878 he was the choice of the citizens
of the Second Ward, and was elected by a
large vote as Supervisor of that district,
serving faithfully and honorably from 1878
to 1880", and giving entire satisfaction. Al
though he took a great interest in public
affairs, he refused a renomination. No
man ever came to his workshop to ask for
assistance that he did not receive it. He
was very generous, but never so in an os
tentatious way. Those who knew him
will remember him as the kind, genial
John, who was always ready to assist a
friend.

Delegates.
RESULTS QUICKLY SEEN

DELAYED ONCE TOO OFTEN.
The Harbors and Rivers Convention
Delegates Remembered Their
Lesson in Washington.
Oakland Office Saw Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 22. j
The somewhat sudden determination of
the War Department to attend to the
rickety obstructions across the estuary had
its origin in one of the most trivial of cir
cumstancesâyet one of the most common
In this city. Of course the necessity for
the work has been placed before the de
partment on several occasions find it
would have eventually been undertaken.
But the suddenness of Colonel Butter's
summons that the old bridges were "un
reasonable obstructions" is said to have
originated in a very simple incident.
When the delegates to the Harbors and
Rivers Convention, which met in San
Francisco a few months ago, made a tour
of inspection of Oakland harbor the bridge
man was a little too attentive to his mas
ters. He heard the tug, on which were the
delegates, whistling for the bridge to open
and he also knew that in a few minutes a
rain wou Id come along, it was nothing
to keep a steamer waiting an hour or bo,
but the Southern Pacific train must
not be stopped at any cost. So thÂ«
tug captain whistled and the autocratic
delegates, consisting of United States
Senators and Congressmen and men of
wealth and influence, fretted and fumed at
the delay, and some are credited with
swearing a little while they waited the
pleasure of the bridge-tender. There were
some aboard the boat who had experienced
the same thing, only in a worse form,
hundreds of times. Senator Perkins, who
is interested in tugboats, was one of the
company; Mayor Davie was another dele
gate, and when the mad company were
told that what they were experiencing
was only a taste of what the nautical men
on both sides of the bay bad been treated
to for a quarter of a century they made
some secret resolutions. These were not
forgotten when Washington was reached,
and as a result there is more than ground
for a hope that one large steel bridge,
placed where it will least inconvenience
navigation, will soon take the place of the
two old rickety structures, whose exist
ence is likely to be soon terminated by the
teredos. There is do doubt that an at
tempt will be made to foist as large a
share of the expense as possible upon the
county. Three years ago, however, that
would have been a much easier matter
than it is to-day.
In his epsech at the Taberu-de last
Thursday night Hon. W. R. Davis made
a few remarks that have a significance
other than political. He spoke of the
many advantages that have been lost to
Alameda County in the past, because of
the chronic warfare that has existed polit
ically, socially, philanthropically and
commercially. This reference has a direct
bearing on the great social event that will
be held on May Day for the benefit of
Fabiola Hospital. Last year this great
charitable festival was inaugurated, and
was a pronounced success. Its success was
solely due to the fact that all parties,
factions and cliques combined for the oc
casion and forgot for a few brief hours that
they were not born to bicker. This year,
the same spirit is being manifested, only
in a more marked degree. Fabiola is Oak
land's only large hospital, and it is in
charge of ladies who manage it as a labor
of love and thus minimize its expenses.
Without it hundreds of sufferers would
annually be forced to suffer ten-fold more
than their ailments demand. Fabiola is
open to all. Patients who are able to pay
are not permitted to be a burden on the
funds that are intended for the needy, and
the latter are not turned away because
they are destitute. Tne institution is the
crowning piece of Oakland's philanthropy,
and it is comforting to know that
whenever the needs of Fabiola have been
made known they have invariably been
supplied. This year's floral fete will be
no exception.
Gavin Dhu High, the newspaper man,
has annouuced his intention of starting a
penny evening paper next week. This is
a novelty, and the public mind of Oakland
is wondering how they can be purchased.
Not a quarter of the people of Oakland
have ever seen a penny and would disdain
it if they saw it. As an evening paper
must naturally depend upon street salet=,
opinion is divided as to whether readers
will be required to buy rive copies or
whether the medium of exchange will be
one-cent postage stamps. Mr. High set
the thinkers at rest to-day. "I have or
dered 25,000 pennies from Washington,"
he said "and I shall get them this week
through the sub-treasury of San Francisco.
This will be the beginning of the use of
pennies and I think it will not be long be
fore they are in common exchange." The
introduction of pennies has been fre
quently discussed, and the coming exper
iment will be watched with interest.
Very few people are aware that the whole
of the "executive department of the city's
government is dependent upon the whim
of one man. Under the present constitu
tion of the Board of Works one man is
like a third wheel to a bicycle, and either
of the other two can do as he pleases.
Just now Messrs. Wilson and Peirsol are
pitted against Mayor Davie. At their next
meeting they could if they like, change
the entire personnel of the police, fire and
street departments. The duo have placed
their friends in portions just as they
pleased, and the Mayor is relieved of the
responsibilities attaching to patronage,
because he has none. For some time there
has been a rumor that Wilson and Peirsol
were not as united outside the board ro^m
as their votes would indicate. A rupture
would upset the whole government, as an
alliance with Davie would immediately be

NOVEL RIGHT TO VOTE.
County Clerk Jordan Meets With Some
Strange People.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 22.â The affi
davits of registration that are coming in
to the County Clerk by thousands need
very careful scanning. A notable instance
of irregularity was found yesterday. It
was that of James Lyons, a native of Ire
land, 67 years of age, who resides at 660
Adeline street. Lyons' affidavit reached
the office complete with one exception. In
the blank in which is to be explained the
manner in which the applicant for regis
tration became naturalized appeared the
words, "By transfer from Ynba County."
On the great register of two years ago is
found the same expression, "By transfer
from Yuba County."
Speaking on the subject, Mr. Jordan
said to a reporter: "I know of no pro
vision of the law by means of which a man
may be naturalized by 'transfer from Yuba
County' or from any other county, and no
person's name will go on this register who
has not at least some legal means of natu
ralization to snow. That Lyons was on
the last great register is no proof that
Lyons was entitled to vote. I have been
compelled to write to Yuba County to as
certain whether the register up there
shows whether or not Lyons was ever natu
ralized, and if there is no proof of that fact
there, then he must tell here how he was
naturalized before his name can go on this
register."
POLICE RIFLE MATCH.
Oakland Against San Francisco at Shell
Mound Next Saturday.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 22.â Captain
Fletcher has selected his team of sharp
shooters from the Police Department
which is to try conclusions with a similar
team from the San Francisco Police De
partment Saturday afternoon, March 28,
at Shell Mound Park. The preliminary
practice was completed yesterday and the
average counted. The team will comprise
the following: Nick Williams, D. \V,
Swain, J. F. Sill, J. M. Cockerton, Frank
Schroder, C. E. Clarke, W. Kingsbury, L.
E. Andrews. J. J. McCarthy, H. C. Arnest;
alternates, J. F. Stahl and W. J. Peterson.
Colonel Robert McKillican, ex-Sheriff of
Alameda County, will act as referee for the
Oakland team. A dinner for twenty will
be paid for by the losing team.
From Steam to Lightning.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 22.â The
Laundry Farm Railway Company is con
templating the conversion of its steam
road to an electric line.
Manager Rank and his colleagues think
the property-owners should give the com
pany a bonus for making the change.
Many of them have consented to subscribe
to a fund for an electric line, and only a
few are holding out. Just as soon as they
come into line the steam system to Laun
dry Farm will be abandoned, and electric
cars will skirt the hills to the quarry on
the mountain.
The change in the motive power on the
California road will affect a large district.
The ateam line now connects with the
Southern Pacific's line at Fruitvaie, and
goes through the valley past Mills College
and then up into the hills to Laundry
Farm. An eiectric-car can easily ascend
the grades. It is proposed to continue the
Laundry Farm line along the tidal canal
until it taps the main electric line of the
| Oakland and Alameda Electric Railway
I Company on Pane street.
Death of Mrs. IHvinelle.
OAKLAND, Cal.. March 22.-Mrs. I. E.
Dwindle, widow of the late I. E. Dwinelle,
professor of the Pacific Theological Semi
nary, died this morning at the home of
her*son-in-law, Dr. J. J. Wilcox. The de
ceased lady was seventy-two years of age
and was the mother of Mrs. H. E. Jewett,
Mrs. Wilcox and H. Dwinelle.
ALAMEDA'S INJUNCTION.
A League Formed for the Municipal
Ownership of Public Utilities.
A Feud.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 22.-A good
deal of work has been done on tha exten
sion to the electric plant for which the
Board of Municipal Trustees have let con
tracts approximating $20,000. The work
has now been enjoined and there will have
to be a hearing in court before it is settled
whether operations will be resumed. The
point of contention is that the additions
proposed to the electric plant are to en
large it so that the city may sell incan
descent lights to private consumers. It is
contended that there is no law permitting
municipalities to engage in the business of
supplying commercial light to general
consumers.
State League.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 22.â 1t is pro
posed to get up a State association of mu
nicipal ownership leagues. The league
formed in Alameda is the starting point.
Letters soliciting other cities to join in the
movement have been sent out and About a
dozen answers have been received favor

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 23, 1896.
FORGETS THAT MINUTE
Everything Is Clear to Him
But the Firing of
the Shot.
VISITED BY FEW FRIENDS.
His Attorney Will Argue That a
Letter Ruled Out Influenced
the Verdict.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call.)
908 Broadway, March 22. |
Benjamin T. Hill has been visited by but
few friends since his conviction for the
murder of his wife, but he still feels confi
dent that he will be ultimately acquitted.
The condemned man's hope is based
upon the fact that his memory is a com
plete blank for the minute during which
he killed his wife. He has no recollection
of actually firing the fatal shot although
he remembers all that led up to it, and the
circumstances that followed it. Next
Wednesday morning he will appear before
Judge Ogden for sentence and his attorney
will argue in favor of a new trial. One of
the points on which the plea will be based
is the ruling out of evidence of a letter
from Hill to his wife in which he asked
her not to go bicycle-riding in bloomers.
Since the verdict was reached Hill has
been not onÂ« whit less self-composed than
before the trial. In some respects he is a
remarkable man. He looks upon the
murder of his wife as an act of justifica
tion and says that her statements to him
just previous to the murder rendered him
insane.
The only tender spot in his nature that
is shown to visitors is touched when refer
ence is made to his little four-year-old boy.
Hill is evidently very fond of his boy. He
has said that he would just as soon be dead
as alive if it were not for the child. If the
penalty for his crime shall be dealt out to
the father the lad will be placed some
where where he will never learn of the
fate of his father and mother.
"I have tried hundreds of times to fix
my mind on the minute during which I
fired the shot," said Hill to a friend yes
terday, "but I cannot do it. I can remem
ber very well that each moment as my
wife Bpoke I could feel that I^was losing
control of myself, but after she slapped me
on the face I remember nothing. Al
though 1 knew something of what was go
ing on, I was not prepared for what she
told me. I could not believe it and it
drove me mad. 1 remember meeting the
carmen and giving myself up, but not un
til I saw my wife on the sidewalk did my
senses return.

that a new trial will be granted. The death

OAKLAND, Cal., March 22.â The body

TOBACCO FARM
IS A SUCCESS
It Can Be Grown Profit
ably in Alameda
County.
LARGE CROP READY.
Result of Experiments With the
Soil of Livermore
Valley.
EVERYTHING WILL GROW.
C. E. Hahn Proves the Correctness
of His Judgment of Fonr
Years Ago.
Oakland Office Saw Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 22. f
E. C. Habn, who manages the big Alt
schul ranch, which is situated about four
miles north of Livermore, has proved be
yond a doubt that tobacco can be grown in
this county of excellent quality and in
any quantity.
For some time past Mr. Hahn has been
making experiments in tobacco culture.
He has long since become convinced that
a soil that will grow French prunes, al
monds, lemons, oranges, wainuts and
olives can produce tobacco. Last year
enough success was attained to justify the
planting of a large crop and ft is now in
excellent condition. It is located in a
warm belt and was not affected by the re
cent cold spell. It has thrived beyond the
planter's expectation and a healthy sec
ond crop is now growing. This success,
early in the spring, is seldom attained.
The future of the tobacco industry must
depend in a great measure on the pecul
iar delicate flavor of the leaves, and ex
periments are now being carried out with
the soil that it is claimed will make Cali
fornia tobacco equal to the finest brands.
For some time the tobacco plant has
thrived in the southern part of the State,
but a crop of any size has not yet been
produced in Alaineda County.
Mr. Hahn is an enthusiast in his worlc,
and when he commenced operations in Liv
ermore Valley about four, year ago he made
a critical examination of the loam and ex
pressed an opinion that anything could be
grown upon it. He has since proved that
nis opinion was correct.
"My experience with tobacco is highly
satisfactory," said Mr. Hahn, "and I am
now convinced that in the near future that
industry will make great strides. The
growing is only one branch of the busi
ness, however, and when that is under
taken on a large scale it naturally follows
that California will manufacture her own
cigars, and that will be almost another in
dustry. California tobacco and cigars
have been very favorably spoken ot lately,
and there is no doubt that the business
will prove profitable."
Superintendent McCoy of some of the
Vanderbilt roads was in Oakland a week
ago. He was the guest of Mayor Davie,
and the host provided a dinner that was
Californian throughout. There was noth
ing edible that had not been produced in
California. The cigars were the subject ot
special discussion. After sampling a few
Mr. McCoy stated there was no need to go
to the Southern States when such material
could be supplied right at home.
AVILL COMK WITH TIME.
The Oakland Custom-Hoiine Is Not
Doing a Rushing Business.
OAKLAND, Cal, March 22.âCommis
sioner English of the Oakland Custom
house has not yet received much of his
official literature and seal. It is a matter
of time before a large business can be built
up, as merchants who import roust have
their goods shipped to Oakland, and the
voyage takes time. They could not have
them shipped here till the office was open,
but there will soon be enough to keep Mr.
English busy.
"I have not had the flag raised
even," said Mr. English, "because I do not
feel that we are ready for much work at
present.
"Ships are being rezistered from this
port continually, and two inspectors are
employed at the wharves. The fact that a
heavily loaded ship cannot enter the port
here will of course interfere with business
until the channel improvements are made.
"The coal steamers will enter this port
and will, of course, bring considerable
trade. The effect of the establishment of
a local Custom-house will not be felt in
business for some months. The great ad
vantage to the merchants will be in being
able to have imported goods sent directly
to this port. The office is not paying ex
penses at present, but as soon as our
facilities are better adapted to trade, the
Custom-house wilt more than pay all ex
penses and bring in a handsome revenue."

anticipated that an unusually large crowd

gents is expected to be present.
Athletic News From the East.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 22.â Acting
Manager William Nat Friend and Captain
Merwin of the '96 Eastern track team re
ceived an important and highly encourag
ing teiesram last night from the University
of Pennsylvania in response to a dispatch
sent asking if a meet between the Califor
nia team and their athleto3 could be ar
ranged for the coming summer. Follow
ing is what Captain George W. Orton of
the Pennsylvania team had to say:
Philadelphia, Pa., March 21.
L. T. Merwin, Track Captain, Berkeley: May
dates are all rail. Happy to meet you any day
after intercollegiate championship. Guaran
teed hearty welcome and a good gate.
George Â»V. Orton.
All the athletes are greatly enthused
over the receipt of such a favorable and
highly encouraging reply from one of the
Big Four, and are already planning how
I they will work off the tie which was made
against the U. P. men in the dual meet
Jast May. Of the three telegrams from
Yale, Princeton and Pennsylvania received
by the management within the Jast week
the one received last night was the most
favorable. Now, since it. is possible to
have a match with Pennsylvania, with the
assurance of good support, it is thought
that the other colleges of the East with
whom Berkeley desires to arrange meets
will fall into line and thus make a second
transcontinental tour of California muscle
a possibility.
Up to the present time the Berkeley
men had thought of going only as far as
{ the Middle West colleges, but the favora
; ble news from the big institutions on the
I Atlantic has put a different aspect on
matters.
A meeting of the athletic executive com
mittee will be held next Tuesday after
noon at which preliminary measures con
nected with the proposed second trip will
be discussed. It is generally conceded
that W. M. Friend, who has been assisting
Captain Merwin with the preliminary
business details of the trip thus far, will
be elected manager.
FOOTBALL AT HAYWARDS
The Tallejo Team Come Down to
Get Licked and a Ban
quet.
HAY WARDS, Cal., March 22.â About
2000 people assembled at the ground? of
the Haywards Athletic Club this after
noon to witness the football match be
tween the Farraguts of Vallejo and a team
from Haywards. The local team was re
enforced by Pete Smith of the Olympic
Club of San Francisco and Frick, Racine,
Hanlon and McHugh of the Reliance Club
of Oakland.
It was apparent at the start that the
visitors stood no chance with such a
strong aggregation. In the first half the
local team made two touchdowns and one
goal. The visitors made a touchdown on
a fumble and kicfced a goal. Score, first
half â Haywards 10, Yallejos 6.
In the second half Haywards made four
touchdowns and the same number of:
goals; Vallejo did not score in the second
half. Scoreâ Haywards 31, Vallejos6.
McGuire, Lee and Kavanaugh played
excellent ball for the Farraguts, and
special mention was made of the playing
of Smith, Frick, Racine, McHugh, Wells,
Lacunha and Carter of the local team.
Corcoran of the Vallejos had his nosa
broken in a scrimmage.
After the game the visitors were ten
dered a banquet, and arrangements have
been made for a return game in three
weeks at Vallejo.

at the nod of "Jimmy" McCormick for
$2000. The good performer Veragua went
to N. S. Hall for $360.
St. Dunstan, the promising two-year-old,
was knocked down to L. A. Legg for $800,
and the same bnyer paid $1300 for Zamar,
the winning son of St. Carlo and Royal
Bess. The others went at prices ranging
from $100 down to $20.
Six head of horses owned by the Mon
tana millionaire, Marcus Daly, that have
been racing at the local tracks, were also
catalogued" to pass under the hammer, but
after Skalkaho had gone for $180 and Trap

THE HANDBALL COURTS.
Champions J. Harlow and P. T. Don
nelly Both Sustain Defeat in
Team Matches.
The handball courts were crowded yes
terday, more particularly the San Fran
cisco Court, where every seat in the gal
lery was occupied. Two matches that had
been looked forward to with great interest
attracted the crowd.
The first one was between T. F. Bonnet
and N. Williams and P. T. Donnelly, the
amateur champion, and G. Hutchinson.
Bonnet and Donnelly are, as a rale, part
ners, hence the interest evinced in seeing
which would come out ahead. Donnelly
and Hutchinson won the first two games
with apparent ease and the spectators
came to the conclusion that it would be a
one-sided affair, but they were agreeably
disappointed. Bonnet and Williams
played all round them ana won the next
three games in rattling style.
The other match was between J. Harlow,
the coast champion, and P.Kelly and R.
Linehan, the overhand swiper, and J.
Ffeney. Harlow did not appear to be in
his usual form and Linehan and Feeney
won as they liked.
The principal attraction at the Union
Court was a match between J. J. Feeney
and Terry McManus and R. Linehan and
Professor Lynch. It was closely contested
from start to finish, the final being won
by Feeney and McManus by only one ace.
Next Sunday J. C. Xeaion and T. F. Bon
net will play Linehan and Feeney, the
"cracker-jacks" of the court.
Following were the games played yester
day:

THAT CIRCUS TWENTY.
Positive Proof That the Road
Has Lost Some
Money.
FILIMORE GROWS PATHETIC.
He Does Not Remember the Exciting
Chase After the Circus Which
Defaulted in Rent Money.
It was too much for even the traffic of
the sea to bear and that is why the pack
age of letters and telegrams was cast up on
the Lime Point beach a few days ago.
These letters were from high officials of
the greatest corporation in the State and
dealt with all the diplomatic finesse of
which the $5000, $10,000 and $20,000 a year
salaried officials were capabie. They were
trying to recover the small sum of $20 gold
coin of the United States from a traveling
circus which had paid the railroad com
pany a clear profit of $1086 for transporta
tion, the profit being more than 66 per
cent.
C. P. Hnntington's chase after that
acrobatic twenty cost the railroad com
pany a good round sum. There were
neither telephones nor typewriters in those
days and letter postage cost 3 cents a half
ounce. Writing-paper and ink were also
dearer. Add to this the fact that Assistant
Superintendent Wilder and Secretary J.
08. Gunn were obliged to spend several
minutes of their valuable time and con
eideraljle of the office stationery in writing
to and fro to head off that $20 and it will
be seen that the company must have been
out at least 15 cents in postage stamps and
stationery and at least $2 for the time of
Messrs. Wilder and Gunn.
But this is not all. J. A. Fillmore, then
the division superintendent at Sacramen
to, was written to concerning the flying
double eagle, and it is of tradition that he
expended an hour of bis time, worth at
least $1, in trying to convince the skepti
cal circus man that his spangled traffic
could bear $20 in addition to the $1536 al
ready paid by the circus people. This dol
lar was added to the other items of ex
pense and placed in the profit and loss ac
count, and the item was no doubt tear
fully consulted by Mr. Huntington before
he swore that his road was losing money.
The bill of expenses runs something like
this:

The letters are worthy of republication
in this issue, for they prove that Mr.
Stubbs had his eye on the past as well as
the future when he told the legislative
committee a few years afterward that the
policy and method of the company had
been and was to charge all that the traffic
would bear.
There is a pathetic wail in the first let
ter because the circus slipped through Mr.
"Wilder's hands:

Office of Assistant Superintendent J

J. 08. Gunn Esq., Secretary, .San
Franciscoâ Dear Sir: Queen's c-ircu*
used our lot at Woodland for showing.
I didn't know of it until too late to ask
Mr. Towne about charge and get reply
before they left the road. Since then I
have endeavored to have J. A. F. , Sac,
collect Â»3O for me, but they refuse to
pay, saying lot was included in con
tract. This Mr. Towne doesn't so un
derstand. Will you have measures
taken from general office to collect 920
on our account before they leave C. P.
K. R.? Tours truly,
A. D. WILDER, Asst. Supt.
On the back of this letter Mr. Gunn, with
an effort at economy which should entitle
him to the first vice-presMency of the
Southern Pacific Company, wrote:
A. D. W.: We received 51586 for the
transportation of this circus. Our ex
pense in doing so, at the most extrava
gant estimate, could not amount to more
than SSOO, leaving a very heavy margin
in our favor, and 1 think it excessive
illiberality to push them for this matter
of 820 when they were such a benefit
to us and to our intimate connection,
the S. P. R. R. J# G#
It will be observed that Mr. Gnnn was
thinking of Collis P. when he wrote the
foregoing letter, for, with rare presence of
mind, he makes a considerable saving of
ink by using the initials "A. D. W." and
"J. G." instead of the full names. He even
sacrifices his pride sufficiently to drop the
"O." in his name and also the "B."afterit,
which might stand for plain "O'Brien.''
The letter, however, shows that Mr.
Gunn was not a railroad financier. His
even intimating that, the great corporation
had been guilty of iilibeiality and should
sacrifice its dearest principle by being
liberal to its patrons was a confession that
there was something out of kilter with his
moral and mental make-up, and that he
had actually committed high treason
against that shiboleth of the corporation

Gunn is no longer on the roll of the cor
poration's employes, and is in the service
of a corporation which has competitors
and which does not charge all that the
traffic will bear. â¢
It is reported that when Mr. Wilder re
ceived Mr. Guiin's reply a cabinet meeting
of the law department was promptly
called, and on a session of the court being
held en bane, an opinion was handed
down unanimously (at a cost of several
hundred dollars in audition to the $3 15
already expended), to the effect th..t the
whole power and machinery of the great
corporation should be set in motion at
once and the $20 should be collected even
though it might be necessary to beard the
lion in his cage.
But to the dismay of the grief-stricken
officials it was discovered that the circus
had slipped out of the State and was off
somewhere on another road. So, the loss
was written in red ink on the wrong side
of the ledger for future reference when it
should be necessary to swear that the cor
poration as well as its traffic was losing
money.
Mr. Fiilmore was shown copies of the
letters yesterday and read them with much
interest. After scrutinizing the hand
writing he did not deny their authenticity,
but he seemed to be chiefly interested in
explaining how it happened that the cor
poration, being a transportation company,
was also engaged in the business of leasing
circus rings, Punch and Judy shows and
merry-go-rounds. He explained that out
side parties sometimes asked exorbitant
and prohibitive rents for circus grounds,
and in such cases, to protect its patrons,
the corporation allowed the circus and
sideshows the use of a portion of its reser
vation where such use would not tend to
j endanger its property. He did not know
whether or not rent was charged.
"In this particular case," added Man
ager Fiilmore, "the circus was not on my
division. It was at Woodland. The time
was so long ago that I have no recollection
of it W r e are not in the business of leas
ing real estate, and we do it only for the
purpose of protecting our patrons from
extortion. We only rent for uses of trans
portation, such as lumber-yards, can
neries, fruit-drying establishments and the
like."
Mr. Fillmore expressed the opinion that
the statement that the letters were found
on the beach was a fake, and that they
had been obtained in some less remark
able way.
There was a pathetic inflection in Man
ager Fiilmore's voice when he spoke of the
people who were trying to rob the circuses
by charging them exorbitant ground rent.
The tender solicitude of the railroad com
pany for its patrons and its fear that some
one other than itself might rob them is
enough to make one shod tear?.
Going from the presence of Manager Fill
more into that of J. 08. Gunn was like
jumping from Central America into the
YuKon mines.
Mr. Gunn was so cold when the subject
was broached that the suspicion arose
that he was loaded with compressed air.
"I don't wish to make any statement,"
he said. "The matter is too trivial to remem
ber. It's a piece of foolishness. Even if
it was true, The Call is wrong, for if the
railroad wanted all that the traffic would
bear it would have got that $20 from the
circus. It's too far back, anyhow, to talk
about. All the jnen who owned the road
then are dead, except one."
By this time Mr. Gunn was on the front
porch and his visitor was balancing on the
balustrade.
"Why go back to ancient history ? It is
not any issue to-day," proceeded Mr.
Gunn in icy tones.
The visitor pulled up the collar of Mb
overcoat and fled shivering down the
street.
SENTENCE POSTPONED.

Charles A. Bailey, druggist at Grant ave

by a jury in Judge Campbell's court on
j Friday of selling morphine without a
: doctor's prescription, was to have been
sentenced Saturday morning, but he failed
to appear.
When the case was called Attorney Len
j non handed the Judge a certificate from
Dr. Garwood, to the effect that Bailey was
confined to his bed from nervoxis prostra
tion and he asked for a continuance till
j Wednesday next.
The Judge studied the certificate for a
â  minute or two, and then remarked that if
i it had not been from a reputable physician
| he would have issued a bench warrant for
j Bailey's arrest. He wanted no unneces
; sary delay and refused to grant a continu
ance till Wednesday.
Attorney Lennon said he proposed to
ask for a new trial.
The case of Otto Jackson, clerk in Car
roll's drugstore, on Stockton and Market
street?, enarged with a similar offense by
Mrs. Sarah McConnell, was transferred to
Judge Conlan's court.
Mrs. McConnell said yesterday that she
would endeavor to have Bailey imiicted
for perjury by the Grand Jury in swearing
that she presented to him a prescription
for the morphine signed "Morrison, M.D."
As soon as the court stenographer has

Huntington Shows His Hand in
the Game Against the Pana
ma Railroad.
IT WILL BE FOHCED INTO LINE.
Should Freights Be Advanced Too Far
the Traffic Association Will
Take a Hand.
Collis P. Huntington has at last shown
his hand in the contest he has been
waging against the Panama Railroad
Map of the District Formerly Called San Miguel Ranchn, Showing the Section of
the City in Which Titles Are Clouded by the Noe Suit, i
through the medium of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company, and from appear
ances it is one that is destined to win to
the injury of every merchant in the coun
try who has any occasion to snip a pound
of freight. In fact the victory of the Cali
fornia railroad magnate will be a cinch on
the whole country.
Ever since the contract between the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company and the
Panama Railroad Company was signed
last December, which provided for a traffic
arrangement between the two carriers on
through freight between this City and
New York. C. P. Huntineton has been cut
ting rates on the Southern Pacific Railroad
and using that line in such a way as to
prevent the contract between the compa
nies mentioned from being of any benefit
to the Panama Company. In other -words,
he first placed the Panama road where it
could be held by his Pacific Mail Company
in a helpless position while he proceeded
to give it a metaphorical drubbing with
his Sunset road, until it was ready to
forego its much-vaunted independence
and become a party to any deal that might
be determined upon by the transconti
nental lines for the purpose cf increasing
their revenues by a general advance in
rates.
From dispatches that have just come
from New York it appears that the Pan
ama Company has now become amenable
to the discipline of Mr. Huntington, and
is to enter into an arrangement whereby
it is to receive a subsidy that will make its
dependence on the wnims of Huntington,
and the other railroad magnates bearable
and prove somewhat of a compensation
for the loss of public confidence that is
certain to result from this proposed com
bination.
According to one of the dispatches the
old Transcontinental Traffic Association is
about to be reorganized in New York and
is to become a factor in the readjustment
of freight rates on the Ist of April.
Among other things it is proposed to re
store the old allowance of $72.-500 a month
by the railroads to the Panama route car
riers. For this sum the steamers of the
Panama route are to reserve space for 600
tons of through freight on each voyage.
Under its contract with the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company the Panama
Railroad Company will receive 55 per cent
of this proposed subsidy.
At the time when the agreement between
the Panama Railroad Company and the
Pacific Mail was first made public here E.
H. Hinton, representing the Panama peo
ple in this City, in the course of an inter
view in Thk Call, speaking in behalf of his
company, said :
I am aware that there is a very general con
viction among the merchants that the Panama
railroad has surrendered "horse, foot and
dragoons" to the transcontinental rail in
terests, and that henceforward it will retire
from the carrying of any traffic in competition
with said lines. In view of the fact that
this conviction has absolutely nothing in
the actual conditions to sustain it, it seems
quite remarkable that it should be so univer
sal. The Panama Railroad Company has no
intention of abandoning the coastwise traffic j
between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the
United States, and there is nothing in the new
contract which can or will be permitted to in
terfere with its maintaining a close and active
identity with that traffic.
"The Panama Railroad has not sold out nor
surrendered, and its interest in transconti- I
nental traffic is not one whit less keen than it I
has been during the past three years. To quote
the language of our president, J. Edward
Simmons, the Panama officials, in formulating
the contract, 'made it an inditpensa- I
ble condition, that the Panama Railroad
should be kept open as an independent
and active competitor of the transcontinental
lines.' One of the most marked features of the
new agreement is the strong guarantee it af
fords of the perfect independence of the 'Pan
ama route,' and the line Is entitled to just as
cordial support now from the merchants of
San Francisco as though the Panama Railroad
Company were operating Its own steamers in
the Pacific."
As the result of these strong assertions
made in the interest of the Panama Rail
road, the announcement that it was about
to become a party to a deal by which the
merchants of this City, as well Â»s those of
the entire country, were again to be placed
completely at the mercy of the Transcon
tinental Traffic Association, came with
surprise as well as consternation.
But the feeling of consternation soon
gave way to one of indignation and
determination, as shown in an interview
with W. R. Wheeler, a member of the firm
of Holbrook, MerriJl & Stetson, and a
member of the executive committee of the
Traffic Association of San Francisco. He
said:
"This move will only result in the mer
chants using the Horn route as soon as this
combination is effected. They will use the
sailing vessels, and this action will also
stimulate the establishment of an inde
pendent steamship line by way of the
Isthmus of Tehuantepec as described in a
recent issue of The Call.
"We will rssist any attempt to increase
rates beyond a reasonable point. If the
Panama Railroad Company becomes a
party to this deal, it will result in the mer
chants of this coast never again putting
any faith in the protestations of the Pan
ama Railroad that in any arrangement
with the Southern Pacific Company they
they would not lose there independence.but
would always remain a genuine competi
tor of the transcontinental lines. It is be
cause the Panama people have made such
strenuous declarations of their independ-
ence that I am inclined to doubt that such
an agreement as telegraphed from New
York will be marie
"The matter will certainly be brought
before the Traffic Association for action as
the merchants of the community are not
in any temper to submit to the past meth
ods and exactions of the railroad people.
"Personally, I feel no anxiety over the
matter, such as I would have felt before
the experience of the past three years and
the present condition of the temper of our
merchants and shippers. We demonstrated
our ability to break up the Transconti
nental Traffic Association once, and I have
no doubt we will be able to disrupt it
again, should its members go too far in
advancing rates. There are plenty of good i
steamers to bo had at snort notice, and fair j
time could be made by them around
the Horn, if we were not satisfied
to depend upon the slower sailing
vessels. And then it would not take
very lonjc to get the Tehuantepec
Railroad into shape and put on competing
steamers between here and New York, and
these same steamers will also engage in
the coastwise traffic that is now monop
olized by the Pacific Mail on this side of
the continent."
E. H. Hinton, the general agent of the
Panama Railroad, said yesterday thtthe
had not heard regarding such an arrange
ment, as outlined in the press dispatches,
was being made. He was aware that there
was a meeting of the representatives of the
various transcontinental carriers, but be
lieved it was simply for the purpose of
agreeing on an advance in rates.
WOMAN SUFFRAGE KALLY.
First Gun of the Campaign at Native
Sons' Hall To-night.
There will be a rousing woman suffrage
rally at Native Sons' Hall this evening.
The speakers will be Miss Busan B. An
thony, Rev. Anna H. Shaw, Miss Harriet
May Mills, Mis? Elizabeth U. Yates and
Miss Mary G. Hay. The programme will
be interspersed with lively campaign
songs. A special invitation is extended to
the present voters.
While the need of equal suffrage will re
ceive attention, the monetary question
will also be handled by some of the speak
ers. '
This meeting will be the opening gun of
the campaign, which promises to be a
hard fought one. The ladies who have es
poused the cause are thoroughly in earn
est. They expect to gain a fresh fund of
enthusiasm themselves as well as win
numerous converts this evening. Miss
Yates, Miss Mills and Miss Hay are said
to be valuable acquisitions to the force of
workers.
THEOWN FROM A BUGGY.
Accident to Two Shoemakers on the
Mission Koad.
Two shoemakers, John Attridge, living
at 1305 Broadway, and Julius Williams,
living at 1722 Leavenworth street, went
out for a drive yesterday morning. While
driving along the Mission road the horse
took fright at a passing electric-car and
j bolted. They lost complete control of the
animal and after running a considerable
distance the wheels of the buggy collided
with a stone wall on the side of the road
and both men were thrown out.
Attridge was badly cut ana bruised about
the head and Williams was bruised all
over his body. The patrol wagon was
| summoned from the Seventeenth-street
station and the two men were taken to the
City and County Hospital, where their
injuries were attended to. They appeared
to be suffering more from the shock; to
their systems than anything else.

ORGANIZED FOR
SELF-DEFENSE.
Five Thousand Homes in
Noe Valley Are
Threatened.
MISSION DEFENSE UNION
Formed for the Purpose of Fight
â¢ ing the Heirs of Jesus
A VALUABLE TRACT OF LAND.
Present Owners Base Their Right on
a Decision of the Twelfth Dis
trict Court.
The executive committee of the Mission
Defense Union are making strenuous
efforts to increase the membership of the
organization and are meeting with gratify
ing success. -The three hundred and sixty
ninth member was enrolled yesterday and
it is expected that ( inside of another ten
days a majority, of the property-holders in
the San Miguel Rancho will, have; joined
the union.
This movement was born from necessity
out of self-preservation, when P. L. : Kosci
alowski, in behalf of the four heirs of Jesus
Noe, recently brought suit to recover one
half of the rancho ; from the present hold
ers^ ; - Â â¢ . â 
The property in litigation covers about
4500 acres of the garden spot of this City
and County, which is : held at present by
about 5000 owners, the , greater .? number of
whom have built beautiful homes and live
there. The land is embraced by the fol
lowing lines: Sixteenth :. and Valencia
streets westerly to Stanyan, thence in a
southeasterly direction to a point one
quarter of a mile, west of Lake i Honda,
taking in the Almshouse Tract, thence to
the County line at the crossing of the San
Jose railroad track, following the latter to
Valencia street and back to Sixteenth.
Ali this property was granted to Jesus
Noe by the Governor of California in 1846,
but under the Spanish law it went to him
and his wife ; jointly. The latter, .it is al
leged by her ' heirs, died in ; 1847. These
heirs also claim that, under; the treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo, on September 1847,
at the "close of ,' the Mexican War, the
United â  States . guaranteed to them all
their property rights, and notwithstand
ing that Jesus Noe, i'foj whom I the grant
was made, ; had . conveyed it by deed'
made and recorded on January 10, 1854,
to J. Y. Homer arid W. B. Strode; they
claim now, after forty-two years of waiting,
that they are entitled to their mother's
share of the land.
;. The claim is regarded as : preposterous
by the residents of Noe Valley and by the
leading f lawyers of â  the City, many 'of
whom live in the disputed territory. :.
.It is regarded by them , as aD effort to
cloud the titles of the property and then
sell quitclaim deeds.
This is clear enough. If a person. does
not appear in court within ten days after
service in the suit the Noe heirs will be en
titled to have a default entered, and, in
order to get it off the record, it will be
necessary. for the delinquent to employ an
attorney, give notice to the heirs and pro
cure an order of court setting aside the
default and allowing an answer to be tiled.
; :.. It is to avoid all this trouble that the
Mission Defense Union was ; instituted,
with John H. ; Grady, president; John
Bolger, vice-president;. S. W. ' Fuller,
treasurer; 'A. P.' Van Duzer, secretary, arid,
Iger, vice-president; S. W. Fuller,
isurer; A. P. Van Duzer, secretary and
The \ executive . committee . consists ; of
Messrs. H. N. Nolt, chairman ; J. K. C.
Hobbs, Thomas . Kerby, Peter McArdle,
Edward Maher,' D. Hulse and George W.
Boyd.
These gentlemen are acting for the bene
fit of all the residents of ,' Noe Valley, but
they are particularly : anxious ;to - have the
great mass of residents join them, as in
the union they will find greater strength.
The admission fee is but $1, and it â is the
purpose of the union, through Attorney
Van Duzer, to gather all the separate cases
into one ;' bunch, ' every defendant being
represented atone time, arid none having
the suit go against him by default.
The law upon which the defendants are
strong in their ownership of their prop
erty is the . decision rendered , October
20, 1860, in the Twelfth v District Court in
the case of Adolph a Boric against . Richard
Roman, Maria Dolores, Jose Jesus Noe and
Miguel Noe.
The deoision : was ; never appealed from
and it is claimed that the judgment is still

CAUGHT RED HANDED.
An Ex-Convict Attempts to Steal a
Nickel-m-the-Slot Machine.
Henry Lewis, alias Levy, thought he had
conceived an effective way of beating a
nickel-in-the-slot machine. Levy ia an ex
convict, and is not at all particular about
the means he employs to obtain a desired
end. About 3 o'clock yesterday morning
he peered through the cracks of the mov
able board front to Schoenfeldt & Co.'s
cigar-store at 107J4 Fifth street and ob
served a dice machine, operated by nickels,
standing on the counter. He pushed
against the board front of the store and
succeeded in forcing an opening. Stand
ing back for a few minutes to allow the
crowd to pass te approached cautiously
and took possession of the inanimate
gambler.
From a shady nook across the street Of
ficer T. J. Burke had witnessed the entire
proceeding, and he arrived on the scene
just as Levy was emerging with his prize.
On the way to the station Levy, in an
undertone, requested a by-stander to in
form John Daly, at 189>Â£ Fifth street, that
his friend Levy was arrested. Burke gave
the bystander to understand that it would
not be well for him to do anything of the
kind, and, after having Levy locked up, he
went to the .address indicated. He was
admitted by Daly, and two regulation
jimmies and a number of suspicious-Jook
mg articles were found in the room. Daly
was arrested on a charge of having burg
lar's tools in his possession. He is known
to the police as a disreputable character.
