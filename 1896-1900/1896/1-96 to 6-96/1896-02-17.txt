STUART ADMITS
HIS FAILURE
All Fights but the Big
One Are Officially-
Declared Off.
SPORTS ARE DISGUSTED.
Have Given Up Hope of Seeing
a Contest Between Maher
and Fitzsimmons.
JULIAN AGAIN QUIBBLING.
Refuses to Enter Into a Conference to
Arrange for a Meeting on
Friday.
EL PASO, Texas, Feb. 16.â Dan Stuart
announced to the crowd of correspondents
and sports in his office at 8 o'clock to-night
that the Everhardt-Leeds, Walcott-Bright
Eyes, MarshaJl-Dixon and Barry-Murphy
contests were officially declared off, and
that he would pay the forfeit of $500 on
each contest to-morrow. The announce
ment was not coupled with any reasons
for this step, but later it was stated in
Stuart's behalf by one of his associates
that as one of the fights was already past
due and another was scheduled to-morrow
he regarded it useless to carry out the
lesser features of the carnival so long as
the big fight was undecided, and more
over, as the little fellows were beginning
to "kick," the conclusion had been reached
to sponge off the slate, beginning with the
second line.
It is now. more likely than ever that the
first line also will be wiped off to-morrow.
Some complications between the fight
ers are likely to arise as a result of the
abandonment. Leeds and Everhardt, who
were to have fought on Tuesday, should
weigh in to-morrow under forfeit of $1000.
Everhardt, however, recognizing several
days ago that the game was up, has been
taking things easy and gaining flesh, with
the result that he tips the beam to-night
at 140, or eight pounds over weight. Cap
tain G!ori, Leeds' backer, insists, however,
that the weighing-in shall take place, and
says he will claim the forfeit if Everhardt
fails to appear or if he is over weight.
The consensus of opinion among the ex
pert sports remaining here is that the
rights, having been declared off in advance
of the weighing-in, Glori's position is un
tenable.
The question of fight or no fight, so .far
as the big 'uns are concerned, has been
put off for one more day. After having
dragged Maher's representatives down
from Las Cruees to-day Martin Julian re
fused to go into conference, contenting
himself with the oft-Â»epeated statement of
"We will make known our position to
morrow," as for two weeks before the
Ozark fiasco he chirruped. "We will be in
Hot Springs on October 31."
Fitzsimmons privately expressed him
self this morning to the effect that he re
garded the "jig" as "up," and this is
taken as forecasting his attitude for to
morrow. Both Dan Stuart and Maher,
the latter having been telegraphed for to
night, will have something to say on the
question of forfeit, and the chances are that
the Irishman will not find himself able to
carry things his own way.
Julian and Fitzsimmons came across
from Juarez this morning for the purpose
of meeting the Maher people. The con
ference had been set for noon, but
the train . from . Las Cruees was three
hours late, and after hanging about
for a while the pair went back to
their quarters. When "Buck" Connelly,
who was accompanied by Joe Wolcott,
also of Pittsburg, arrived at 3 o'clock the :
crowd was on the way to the bullfight and
headquarters were deserted. They at once
started for Juarez in a fast rig, and en
countered Julian just as he was entering
the amphitheater. In reply to Connelly's
request for a conference in the evening at
headquarters, with the promoters and cor
respondents as auditors, the brother-in-law
manager reported that Fitzsimmons had a
dinner party for 6 o'clock, and that it
would not be possible for either of them
to come to town until to-morrow morning.
Connelly asked if â¢ Fitzsimmons would
consent to another postponement until
Friday next, with the proviso that if Ma
her's eyes were still affected on that date
no objection would be raised to Fitzsim
mons receiving the forfeiture. To this
Julian replied :
"We will give you an answer to-morrow
morning."
"Why not now," persisted Connelly.
"I have made a journey of several hun
dred miles at your request and some little
consideration is due me as much as to
your dinner party."
"We will answer to-morrow," cuckooed
Julian.
"Give me a straightforward answer here
and now," ejaculated the now thoroughly
aroused Connelly. "I know your mind is
made up and it is as well to answer now
as it would have been three hours ago if
my train had been on time."
"To-morrow." lisped Julian.
Connelly turned on bis heel and bought
a ticket for that section of the amphithea
ter farthest from the seats occupied by the
Fitzsimmons crowd. Oncoming back to
town he went at once to headquarters and
wrote a dispatch to Maher, telling him to
come down on the morning train, even if
he had to envelope his head in a Mexican
blanket. This done, -he said: "We will
see whether or not Fitzsimmons takes the
forfeit in the morning. Friday next Peter
will be in shape to fight for certain, but
we will not put him in the ring a day ear
lier unless we are compelled to. Rather
than concede the" forfeit we will have
Maher in the ropes so that his condition
may be apparent. By doing this we will
save our purse, and the decision will' be
upon the referee. It must not be forgotten,
however, that under the articles the pro
moters must give us twenty-four hours,
notice to get into the ring, and must also
advise us privately where that ring is lo
cated and how we canireach it. We have
The San Francisco Call.
not heard a word from them yet. How
ever, I would like to see the man who
would nay over our forfeit money under
such conditions."
Dan Stuart ana his colleagues listened
to this talk, but said never a word. The
proposed conference of the welter and
feather weights and bantams also failed to
materialize. Marshall, who was to have
met George Dixon, came down from Las
Cruces to-night for the purpose of weigh
ing in to-morrow. He was told by
O'Ronrke, however, that the formality
would bs waived.
Governor Ahnamada sent his secretary
over from Juarez this morning to procure
a supply of the latest American papers
published East of Kansas City. To a rep
resentative of The United Press the Gov
ernor said this evening that he was still
on the alert and proposed to remain at
the post of duty until the lighters had for
a certainty abandoned their plans and
Mexican soil was free from their invasion.
Dan Stuart was pressed acaln to-day by
a number of Eastern men, who are wail
ing over and whistling to keep up their
courage, to give them a candid opinion
upon which they might determine whether
to go home at once or wait a while longer.
One of these, Wells Weidman of Balti
more, spoke his mind freely to the big
promoter. Said he:
"Here I have come nearly 2500 miles on
your say-so, because it was given out that
Dan Stuart had this time a sure-thing con
cession for a fighting carnival and a bull
carnival. Your bull carnival was stopped
and your lights have not materialized.
What sort of a game is it, anyhow? Does
Dan Stuart's word go, or doesn't it?"
But the Baltimorean and those in the
same boat with him are still without satis
faction to-night.
Maher's eyes have improved wonder
fully during the past twenty-four hours.
The catarrhal discharge has been ar
rested, the spots within the lids have van
ished and very little blood remains about
the eyeballs. The face above and below
the eyes, however, is seared from the blis
tering lotions applied by the physicians,
while around the left eye there are several
incrustations. . On the whole, however, the
improvement has been more rapid than
the physician expected.
New articles of agreement are being
drawn up to-night for a fight between
Fitzsimmons and Maher on next Friday.
Buck Connelly says he will deposit $5000
to be forfeited if Maher does not enter the
ring or. Friday. The new agreement will
be submitted to Julian and Fitzsimmons
in the morning. Stuart will use his influ
ence in getting Fitzsimmons' consent to
the new agreement.
Dixon and Marshall have already been
matched to meet before the Long Island
Club March 8 and Bright Eyes and Wal
cott before a Boston club March 15. The
Olympic Club of New Orleans has wired
for the Leeds-Everhart contest, and date
and other details will be settled to-mor
row.
TAME HVTjT.-FIGBTIXG.
! Governor Ahuamada a Spectator at a
Sickening Exhibition,
EL PASO, Tex., Feb. 16.â The bull-tights
at Juarez this afternoon attracted a crowd
of 4000, two-thirds men and women from
the American side. It was a brutal and
disgusting exhibition. The first two bulls
looked more like milch cows and were as
harmless as septuagenarian cats. The
prodding of the bauderilleros, instead of
working them into a frenzy only resulted
in their getting down on their haunches
and bellowing piteously, as though they
could not understand what was required
of them or why they should thus be tor
tured.
The matadors also were mere novices,
and one of them broke three sDears in one
of the helpless animals before giving it its
coup. The remaining two bulls put up a
lively fight, with the result that two pica
dors were severely injured and one horse
killed.
Governor Ahuamada with his staff, Col
lector Bauche and the entire force of Chi
huahua State officials, was present. Lieu
tenant-Governor Cortes presided over the
fight. The sight of a horse whose abdomen
had been ripped open by a bull's horn was
so sickening as to cause numbers of the
American spectators to leave the amphi
theater.
At the' close of the fights Fitzsimmons,
who had occupied a box, asked Governor
Ahuamada if he did not consider bull-fight
ing more disgusting than prize-fighting.
The Governor smilingly remarked that it
was the custom of the country, but that
he deprecated the use of horses in bull
fights.

A Kentvckian Confeamett That He Killed
Hit Wife and Xiecc.
Z AUGUSTA, Ky., Feb. 16.â Robert Henry
Laughlin to-day confessed that he brutally
murdered his wife and his niece, Mary
Janes, yesterday morning at his home on
the Rock Spring turnpike.
Laugh lin seemed easy when the visitors
arrived, but as the Marshal asked him
about some blood on his clothing this
manner left him and his hands shook as
he grasped the arms of the. chair. After
persistent questioning by the Marshal
Laughlin half rose from his chair and
burst out weeping as he groaned: "I did
it. I killed 'em both, God help me, and
then tried to kill myself." , v-
After further questioning he acknowl
enged that he had attacked his niece, and
after killing both her and his wife set fire
to the house.
MRS. LEASE IX A FULPIT.
Thousands Assemble to Hear the Re-
formed Reformer Preach.
WICHITA, Kans., Feb. 16.â Mary
E. Lease began her ministerial career in
this city to-night, and it is safe to say that
no minister ever entered upon his labors
with more flattering prospects than did
the noted Kansas woman. The Central
Chinch of Christ, one of the largest in the
city, was crowded to the . limit of its
capacity, and many thousands were turned
away.
It had been expected that Mrs. Lease
would deal largely in sensationalism, but
her theme and its exposition were far re
moved from anything of that nature.
Many noted divines have spoken to
Wichita audiences, but none of them were
accorded such an enthusiastic reception as
was Mrs.' Lease. It is predicted that her
fame as a pulpit orator will far exceed that
which she achieved us a reformer.

An American Correspondent Claims
He Was Denied Protection by

HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 16.â The air is
full of rumors. One is that twenty-four
political prisoners in the Cabanas were
shot Wednesday night. General Weyler
says he knows nothing of it. It is also said
Gomez has notified Weyler that if Cubans
in the cities are shot he will retaliate by
shooting Spaniards in the interior of the
island. . vj.vi' ;^, V; "- : ;
Gomez and Maceo are both in Havana
province. The latter moved eastward
after the Candelaria and San Cristobal en
gagements, crossed the military line south
of Guanajay, passed' around Guira de
Melena and is near San Felipe. Gomez
has been a few miles east of San Felipe for
several days. A detached column of rebels
moved north and engaged Managua,
fifteen miles from Havana, where the
volunteers surrendered, joining the in
vaders with arms and ammunition. Other
parties moved even to the outskirts of
Havana, taking the horses of milkmen in
the suburban town of Juburbana, and ex
changed shots with the garrison in the
house at Jesus Monte.
With Castillo's party of 2000 men in the
east and Maceo's force from the west,
Gomez has 6000 men under arms operating
in Havana province. Skirmishes between
the outposts are of daily occurrence. The
Spanish officers of minor grades generally
magnify these into battles, but since the
arrival of Weyler the official reports are
much nearer the truth than formerly.
Volunteers are being sent from Havana
to the field. â  â ' <
The order forbidding correspondents to
accompany the columns of troops is
strictly enforced, making it difficult to ob
tain reliable news. Very little is given
out officially.
The American correspondent, Mannix,
ordered to leave, owing to having pub
lished obnoxious news, sailed on the Oli
vett for the United States yesterday.
Mannix hied a formal protest with Ameri
can Consnl Williams. Mannix claims the
latter aided the Spanish Government more
than the American citizen. Williams en
deavored to induce Mannix to leave volun
tarily. Mannix refused until served with
an official order. Williams then cabled a
protest to the Washington State Depart
ment, which replied that it saw no cause
for interference. Mannix shows the fol
lowing copy of an official cablegram said
to have been sent to* the Foreign 'Minister
at Madrid on February 8:
El Duan, Madrid: There is no American cor
respondent in jail in Havana, nor - has this
Government threatened any such representa
tives with imprisonment. There is a party,
however, against whom we have received in
dications that his presence here was prejudi- :
cial; he having, it is claimed, written ob- I
noxious news. The matter being laid before
the American Consul, he suggested and under
took to inform tne party that his departure
from the - island was advisable. INo j threats
were made. The Government has^wortred hi
full accord with Mr. Williams, and as a result,
the obnoxious party will- embark to-morrow,
voluntarily, and without 1 compulsion on the
part of this Government, direct or indirect.
By his excellency, El Secundo Cabo Suarez
Valdea.
Consul Williams declined to talk, under
the rules of the office prohibiting the
giving of information to the press.

HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 16. â Captain-
General Weyler to-night issued a series of
proclamations, in which he still further
defines his proposed policy toward the in
surgents and their sympathizers. The first
proclamation reads as follows:
Article 1. All inhabitants of the district of
Sancti Spiritus and the provinces of Puerto
Principe and Santiago de Cuba will have to
concentrate In places which are the headquar
ters of a division, a brigade, a column or a

Ex-Queen Liliuokalani of Hawaii, Whom President Dole Has Granted a Fa 1 I ar Jon
Â [From a. recent. photograph.] ..
LILIUOKALANI
IS FREE AGAIN
Granted a Full Pardon by
the President of
Hawaii.
BUT ONE RESTRICTION.
Must Ask the Consent of Dole
Should She Wish to Leave
Oahu Island.
THE EX-QUEEN IS PLEASED.
Now at Liberty to Roam Over a Por
tion of the Domain of Her
Ancestors.
HONOLULU, â¢ Hawaii. Feb. 7.â Ex-
Queen Liliuokalani has been granted a
full pardon by President Dole. The decree
was signed last night. Tbe only restric
tions it 'placed upon Mrs. Dominis are
that she shall not leave Oahu island with
out the consent of the President or his Cab
inet officers.
The document which restores the ex-
Queen to full freedom would have been
I signed on the 17th of January, but it was
| thought that it would have been distaste
ful to her ex-Majesty to receive it on such
an unpleasant (for her) anniversary. It
was then decided to postpone the matter
until after President Dole's return from
Hawaii. He came back on Tuesday after
noon and the pardon was signed yester
day afternoon. It was written on two
sheets of paper of the kind usually em
ployed in diplomatic correspondence and
sent from the Foreign Office to the ex-
Queen's residence at Washington place by
a special messenger. It reads as follows:
Executive Building,*
Honolulu, Feb. 7. 1806. )
Mrs. LiliuoJcalani Domini*. Washington Place:
With the advice of the Cabinet I take pleasure
in modifying the restriction placed upon your
freedom at the time of your release from your
confinement.
Until further notice only the observance on
your part of the following conditions will be
required by the Government:
Not to leave the island of Oahu without the
consent of the President or a member of the
Cabinet. . ,'
â  I desire to express my appreciation of the
good faith with which you have observed the
requirements of a former letter.
Sanford B. Dole.
The former letter referred to in the fore
going was as follows:
Executive Chamber,
Honolulu, Sept. 6, 1895. j
Madamâ By the advice of the Cabinet and
Council of State, I have this day signed an
order releasing you from confinement in the
Executive Building, which order provides that
you may be remanded to confinement at any
time upon the order of the President, and also
that your enlargement is subject to such con
ditions as the President may from time to time
require. BfiP
Until further notice, as conditions of your
enlargement, you will be required to occupy
Washington place in Honolulu as your resi
dence .and will not be allowed to absent your
self therefrom over night without the written
consent of the President or a member of the
Cabinet.
During the term of your sentence, or until
the same is modified as to time, you are re
quired to live In a quiet, unostentatious man
ner and to abstain from having political meet
ings or other gatherings at your residence, or
attending such meetings elsewhere.
You will not be allowed to have a retinue or
guards, and your attendants will be limited to
necessary domestics, the number of which is
hereby fixed at thirteen meu and eight women,
besides children. Mr. Wilson an 1 family will
be allowed to reside at Washington place, if
you desire.
In regard to receiving calls, I would call your
attention to the impropriety of receiving
others under, the circumstances than personal
acquaintances and those coming on business.
Trusting to your own judgment and good
faith to carry out the spirit of these instruc
tions, I would intimate that your conduct will
nave influence upon any future consideration
of the further modification of your sentenc?.
Sanford B. Dole.
To Mrs. Liliuokalani Dominis.
It .is understood that the ex-Queen is
very much pleased with the removal of all
restrictions on her personal liberty. As
she never had any desire to leave the
islands the proviso that she cannot leave
without permission cuts little figure. It
is generally understood that the present
state of affairs has been brought about by
the persistent efforts of Charles B. Wilson,
her late marshal and present Â»qen4v under
whose advice she has been acting since her
arrest last year. . â¢;â¢. V<r

Hawaii Overrun by Merchants and
Tradesmen Fr om the Orient.
HONOLULU,- Hawaii. Feb. 7.â The
new Japanese. Consul and Diplomatic
Agent, Mr. Shimamura, left for the island
of Hawaii to-day to personally examine
into the condition of the Japanese laborers
on the sugar plantations of that island.
Mr. Shimamura has been working hard
since his arrival to familiarize himself
with the needs of the Japanese colony in
tnese islands, and there is little doubt but
that the Government will soon hear from
him on several matters pertaining to the
welfare of his countrymen.
Leaders of the different Japanese socie
ties are already discussing and drafting
petitions to the coming Legislature for the
passage of bills enhancing their business
opportunities here. The principal aim of
these discussions and petitions is the plac
ing of Japan on a parity with the United
States in regard to the importation of ex?
clusively . manufactured Japanese goods
which do not enter into competition with
those of the United States. Local Japan
ese merechants want all these goods ad
mitted duty free into the Hawaiian repub
lic.
Another matter which will have to be
considered by the Legislature is the re
quest of numerous Japanese for the is
suance to them of letters of denization.
Thus far the Hawaiian Government has
denied these letters to Japanese, or rather
has dallied with the matter without giv
ing ' a decisive answer. This is probably
the entering wedge in a further demand
for suffrage, which the Japanese have
always claimed under the "favored
nations" clause of existing treaties.
Honolulu's white merchants are begin
ning to feel the encroachments of the
Japanese in various lines, of business to
an alarming extent, but they seem to be
powerless to prevent the constantly in
creasing number of stores and consequent
competition. Three years ago the Jap
anese stores in the city could be counted
on the fingers of one hand. To-day there
are over a hundred of them. Japanese
stores of all Kinds are to be found in every
block; there are over 150 barbershops and
bathhouses run by Japanese. They have
even started blacksmith and harness
stores. Japanese . carpenters, painters
and paperhangers underbid white con
tractors 33 per cent, and the Japanese
quarter of Honolulu is daily becoming
more and more Orientalized.
SHOCKED AY A TEMBLOR.
Subterranean JHaturbance* Give Renewed
'â  Activity to a Volcano. '-
HONOLULU, Hawaii, Feb. 7.â There
were several slight shocks of - earthquake
on the island of Hawaii a few nights since.
One peculiar effect from the shaking was to
to cause lava in the pit of Kilauea volcan
to drop suddenly about eighty feet, caus
ing a crust to form over the surface. Fire
broke through the next morning, however,
and the volcano is now more active than
before.
The earthquake evidently opened up
some subterranean fissure into which the
molten lava dropped. When it was filled
the flow of lava went on as usual. Tourists
to the volcano express themselves as
highly pleased with the wonderful sight
afforded them.
Cruise of the Jtoaton.
HONOLULU. Hawaii, Feb. The
cruiser Boston left yesterday morning for
Yokohama. She took on board 650 tons
of coal here, of which. 150: was carried in
sacks on deck. It is expected she will
make Yokohama without difficulty unless
she experiences bad . weather. If so her
i coal supply will run short.

MRS. NANSEN
IS IN DOUBT.
She Has Received No News
From the Fram or
Its Crew.
REPORTS ARE VAGUE.
Scientists Not Yet Prepared to
Believe That the Pole Has
. Been Reached.
THE OPINION IN WASHINGTON.
Rumor of Nansen's Success Believed to
Have Been Started Through
Some Misunderstanding.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 17.â sDecial
dispatch to the Journal from Christiania
says in regard to Dr. Nansen's reported
discovery of the north pole:
"The news, though exceedingly vague,
is believed by some authorities to have
some foundation; others are in doubt, be
cause of the source from which it origi
nates. I have not the least conception of
where the Fram is now, or when it may be
expected. Eva Nans ex."
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 16.âIn
credulity still reigns supreme among the
scientists in Washington best qualified to
form an opinion on the subject as to the
reported return of Nansen, the Norwegian
Arctic explorer, and the still more re
markable story, without details, of his
having drifted to the north pole and
drifted back again. Dr. William 11. Dall,
one of the most experienced paleontologists
of the United States Geographical Survey,
who has made Arctic matters his particu
lar study, to-day said :
"An examination of the telegrams re
ceived shows that the only facts in our
possession are that a rumor has been
received from Yakutsk to the effect that
Nansen is on his way from the polar sea.
The telegram from Archangel is probably
the result of the receipt there of the same
rumor from Russian sources. Since no
message from Nansen himself is received
and no statement of bi3 whereabouts it
seems probable that the rumor is due to a
misunderstanding of some expression of
his anticipated _. arrival by, persons, In
"Northern Siberia, who had been notified
â  to be on the lookout for Nansen's party.
"It is quite generally understood among
Arctic experts that the alleged discovery
of Jeannette relics on the coast of Green
land was due to a foolish prank of some
persons connected with the naval vessel
which visited Greenland the season of
their discovery and that the guilty parties,
after finding their hoax taken seriously
were afraid to confess the truth. Conse
quently the basis of Nansen's theories, so
far as it was formed by these fictitious
relics, is of little weight.
"That drift from the Bering Strait re
gion might, in the course of years, find
its way out of the passage been Iceland
and Greenland is entirely possible, as
the incident of the Alaskan throwing
a stick proves; but the particular instance
is due to the special circumstances of the
case â temporary winds, currents, etc. â in
all probability, and there is as yet no evi
dence of any permament system of drift.
"If such a system existed it would be
incomprehensible why nothing has ever
been found of the multitude of wrecks
which have been known to drift into the
polar basin from the Bering Strait region,
and of which nothing has ever turned up."

Perish Under the
Sword.
ONE DAY OF HORROR.

Massacre of the Native Christians
Described by an Ameri

FOREIGNERS ARE PROTECTED.
Forced to Remain as Idle Spectators of
the Slaughterâ The Plunder
Complete.
LONDON', Eks., Feb. 16.â United
Press correspondent at Constantinople
sends the following information : The fol
lowing is a letter from Miss Corinna Shat
tuck, dated Ourfa, January 7:
"We had often heard that the Moslems
were dissatisfied with the attempt of Oc
tober 2?, which resulted in the destruction
of only forty lives and about Â£150,000
worth of goods, the plunder of 600 shops
and 239 houses. After this the Christians
were all completely disarmed by the Gov
ernment. Some eighty men had been im
prisoned, and it was feared that there
would be another scene of terror. It came
at last with great suddenness.
"On Saturday. December 23, the firing of
a few guns in the Moslem quarter proved
the signal. Immediately an immense mul
titude gathered on the hill on the side of
the city. â¢ The guards in the streets went
to meet the.people, fired a few shots over
their heads and then . allowed the mass of
wild humanity, thirsty for blood, to pass
into the city and begin their work. The
horrid work continued until dark. Three
soldiers kept the mob back from a street
which they wished to guard, constantly
proclaiming: 'It is the house of a for
eigner whom it is forbidden to touch.'
"I saw one man beaten and then shot
down on the roof just opposite to me on
the other side of the- street. The Syrians
and Roman Catholics were also spared.
All oilier Christians suffered complete loss
of ail home furnishings and some houses
were burned.
"The number of killed cannot he less
than 3500 and may reach 4000. Of tnese
it is estimated that 151)0 perished in the
great Gregorian church. On Saturday
that portion of the city was hardly touched
and great numbers of Armenians flocked
to the church for safety that night. Sun
day morning it begun again at daybreak,
and when the mob reached the church
the soldiers broke open the doors. Then,
entering, they begin the butchery, which
became a great holocaust. ' It was partici
pated in by many classes of Moslems.
"For two days the air of the city was
unendurable. Then began the clearing
up. During two days we saw constantly
men lugging sacks filled with bones and
ashes. The dragging off of 1500 bodies for
burial in trenches wag more quickly com
pleted, some being taken on animals. The
last work of all has been the clearing of
the wells. From one very large well
it is said that sixty bodies were taken.
It is well authenticated that twenty
bodies were taken from another well.
"About 300 persons escaped from the
church by way of the roof, which was
reached by a narrow staircase on the in
side.
"Shortly after noon on Sunday some
fifteen or more of the prominent citizens
and Government officials (not including
the mutessariff or the military com
mander), preceded by a military band and
mounted guard made a grand parade cf
the city. They entered th* inclosure of
foreigners, and assured them of perfect
safety and begged them not to be alarmed,
as 'it was nothing that pertained to them.
"The work did not cease until dark on
Sunday, the 20th. On Monday the Kurds
and Arabs were prevented from entering
the city, the firing â  beginning about dawn.
All day Sunday a strong guard was about
the American premises. A captain Of the
army sat upon his horse for hours at the
northwast corner, just outside of the
church. Repeatedly the foreigners re
ceived salutations and assurances of per
fect safety from Government officials
during that longest of days. It was evi
dent that the utmost was done to protect
them.
"The work of plunder is complete. Lit
erally, naught remains. Our wounded are
many. I have eighteen under my im
mediate care. There is only one doctor
for the whole city. He has 350 and can
not care for more. The Government pro
vides about 200 loaves of bread daily for
the poor. But all this kindness will soon
come to an end and utter poverty will be
the lot of most.
"The Protestant pastor, Rev. H. Abou
hayatian. and several efficient members of
the church are among the dead. An effort
was made to secure the body of the pastor
for separate funeral, but failed.
"The custom in these affairs, so general
in Turkey, seem to be for one party to rush
ahead and kill. This is followed by an
other party, which hurries off the women
and children to some mosque, khan or
some Moslem house temporarily open for
their reception. Lastly, this operation is
followed by the - stripping of the houses.
"Markets are closed and it is very diffi
cult to get some things much needed. We
have had but forty-five beds given back to
us of those plundered, and a few pieces of
copper. As yet I failed to secure more or
instructions as to method of procedure for
individuals to secure stolen goods. The
Government has large numbers of beds,
aim much copper was stored for return to
the owners, but all fear to stir lest the end
has not yet come.
"To-day the long expected soldiers have
arrivedâ Boo or 1000. Our city has been
hitherto guarded by resident soldiers. We
must have your prayers and your pecun
iary aid. How. are the people to live
through this winter?

APPEAL TO. WOMEN.
American Wives and Daughters Asked to
Aid Armenians.
â â â¢ NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 16.â The fol
lowing appeal has been issued to the |
Women of the United States by the Ar
; menian Relief Association :
1 "In the midst of the black ruins of hun
-1 dreds of Armenian villages and once
peaceful homes, appalled by the horrible
murder of 50,000 men, women and chil
dren, shelterless, hungry and in fear of
death, 300,000 Christian people, mostly
women and children, are ready to perish
in the terrible cold of a highland winter.
A strong hand must reach out to bring
some measure of adequate and instant re
lief.
"The Duke of Westminster, president of
the London Relief Committee, has in
formed the Armenian Relief Association
that committees for the distribution of
help have been established in thirteen
principal cities under the supervision of
British consular officers and American
missionaries. One dollar suffices to sup
ply one person with food for two months,
so that at least $250,000 more are required
to keep the people from starvation until
next April.
"Is it not natural that the woman heart
of the West should be touched by the un
paralleled affliction and peril of the women
of Armenia?
"We appeal to 10-30 women of America
to send $100 each, to save at least 100,000
women and children in the depth of the
winter that is upon them. The money
will be sent direct by cable through Con
stantinople to the committees for imme
diate distribution. Checks should be sent
to Charles H. Stent, treasurer Armenian
Relief Association, National Bank of the
Republic, 2 Wall street, New York.
"Will woman's societies and individuals
willing to aid in this work kindly address

SENATOR QUAY'S CHANCES
His Managers Are Confident
That He Will Go Upon
the Ticket.
Chairman Leach Disclaims the Rumor
That He Is but Engineering
a Political Move.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Fob. 16.âChair
man Frank Willing Leach of the Republi
can State Executive Committee returned
yesterday from Washington, where he had
been since Thursday, visiting many politi
cians, including Quay. Being asked to
throw further light on the announcement
of the Senator's candidacy for the Presi
dency, Mr. Leach remarked that his busi
ness in Washington was to get that in
formation.
"I have returned home," he said, "with
a full understanding of the programme of
Senator Quay's friends throughout the
country. For three months a score of the
Republican leaders of the several States
have been urging him to permit the use of
his name, but it was not until a few days
ago that he gave his assent."
To the question whether there would be
an aggressive contest in support of Sena
tor Quay. Chairman Leach replied:
"Yes, the battle is on, and it is a right to
a finish, so far as Quay is concerned.
What I learned in Washington was in the
nature of a revelation to me. I came in
contact with a good many of the leading
members of both houses, as well as with a
number of national committeemen and
other Republican leaders outside of Con
gress, and I am satisfied that Colonel
Quay is the first choice of many of them
and the second choice of nearly all."
Mr. Leach emphatically denied that the
Senator's candidacy was merely for the
purpose of holding the Pennsylvania dele
gation together.
"He is earnestly and aggressively a can
didate and will remain so until the end,"
said he.
ELK IX A CANDIDATE.

Stephen B. Elkins of West Virginia had
announced himself as a candidate for
the Presidential nomination at the St.

State and New Mexico, together with some
from the Southern States.
The person giving the information said
that he had had a conversation with Mr.
Elkins in Washington on Saturday, and ,
he admitted that he would allow his name

MARTINS FERRY, 0., Feb. 17.â The
Buckeye Glass Works, owned by A. D.
Seamon of Wheeling of W. Va., one of
the largest plants of the kind in the
country, caught fire at midnight. It
represents an original investment of
$150,000. There are no hopes of sav
ing it and the firemen have turned
their attention -to saving surrounding
buildings. The new $30,000 city light plant
is in danger.
The glass house, which employs non
union men and was the cause of much
rioting some time ago, was to resume work
March 1. The insurance is light. The
plant will be a total loss. The origin of
the fire is unknown.

FEUD AT THE
BERLIN COURT
Emperor William Snubs M.
Herbette, the French
Embassador.
IS PERSONA NON GRATA.
The Kaiser Refuses to Mingle
With Diplomats When His
Enemy Is Present.
SENSATION AT A RECEPTION.
Why the Traditions of the Father
land's Rulers Were Ignored at
the Subscription Ball.
BERLIN, Germany, Feb. 16.â The Ber
lin season reached its climax on "Wednes
day, upon the "occasion of the annual
subscription ball, which took place in the
Berlin Opera-house. The present season
has been in all respects the dullest of any
social season since the accession of Em
peror William to the imperial throne.
This may be readily accounted for by the
fact that the court is in mourning owing
to the recent death of Prince Alexander of
Prussia and the Grand Duchess of Olden
burg, and another reason may he found in
the withdrawal from Berlin of such emi
nent social leaders as Prince Frederick of
Hohenzollern, Prince Albert of Saxe-
Altenburg, the Duke and Duchess of Eati
bor, the Prince and Princess of Stolberg-
Wernigerode and the Prince and Princess
of Pleas, all of whom have been moved to
quit the capital through differences with
the Emperor, whose arbitrary manners
have become intolerable to those who were
accustomed to the social courtesy which
prevailed during the reign of the old Em
peror, William I.
These causes have combined greatly to
reduce the number of aristocrats in Ber
lin and the tradesmen have consequently
suffered severely and the desertion of the
capital by the most prominent of the old
time social leaders during the period in
which hitherto the Berlin shopkeepers
and other tradesmen formerly gathered in
the real profits of their year's business,
has left nothing for these unfortunate
merchants to hope for in the way of re
couping themselves for the'r outlay in the
accumulation of stock, though the bril
liancy of the assembly at the opera-house
Wednesday evening would seem to refute
the stories of extreme embarrassment of
the tradesmen.
The annual subscription ball is one of
the functions of the year at which those
who are in no way attached to the court
circles and are not recognized as being
eligible to association with the higher
court circles are permitted to mix with the
court personages. At this function, in the
old days, it was a custom for the King of
Prussia to select a burgher's daughter for,
a partner and dance with her, but nowa
days the court merely deigns to join in a
stately walk-around, the Emperor, the
Empress and the officials of the imperial
household marching in procession to the
music of a Strauss Polonaise.
At Wednesday evening's ball the crush
exceeded that of any that has been known
in the experience of the oldest habitue of
this function. A crowd numbering thou
sands, among whom were many ladies re
splendent with diamonds, bankers, manu
facturers and other representatives of the
wealthiest class of the community waited
to view the imperial procession, but they
waited in vain. The court party made its
appearance in the imperial box, attended
by the members of the court. When the
royalties had taken their places the or
chestra struck up the music of the pro
gramme for dancing and kept going from
number to number, and it was some time
before any one realized that there was to
be no procession.
Everybody was asking what had hap
pened to cause the Emperor, who is a
stickler for traditional customs, to aban
don the precedent which has endured for
years. Though the public did not know
the court knew and the diplomatic circle
also knew.
The Emperor has a feud with M. Her
bette, the French Embassador, who was
present in his double function of foreign
Embassador and dean of the diplomatic
corps. It has been the unvarying rule at
this function that at the conclusion of
the court procession the imperial party
has paid a visit to the diplomatic group
and was received by the dean of the corps.
The Emperor decided to avoid a reception
by M. Herbette, and therefore ordered
that the procession be abandoned. This
slight seems to be a person 1 one, but it
may possibly have important political
results.
A report is in circulation which is gener
ally credited in the diplomatic circle that
the Emperor is going to Hubertustock to
remain over the carnival, so" as to avoid
the duty of receiving M. Herbette at the
court ball. If M. Herbette should be re
called in the meantime, the Emperor will
return in time to be present at the ball.
M. Herbette has made his continuance
at his post impossible through a suces
sion of acts which have been . offensive 4 to
the Emperor's ideas of gentlemanly de
portment. Members of the diplomatic
corps are free to say that, while M. Her
bette is a diplomat of undoubted ability,
he is by no means a courtier. : His man-
ners are conspicuonsly bad, and his share
in influencing the recall of : Lieutenant
Baron de Grancy, the naval attache to the
French Embassy here, representing that
tie was not a persona grata with the Ger
man court, brought things to a crisis. : The
Cologne Gazette prints a vicious article on
the subject, declaring that the relations
between Germany and France have been
rendered a great deal worse than they
have been, or otherwise could have' been,
through the presence of M. Herbette in
Berlin as the chief representative of
France. The article has created a great
sensation. ' . â â¢â .. ,
The group which clustered about the
Empress at the subscription ' ball included
the Em press ; Frederick, Princess Freder
ick Leopold of Prussia and ;i Princess Fe
dore of Schleswig-Holstein, sister of the
Empress, the Princess of Reuss, Duchess
Wilhelm of Mecklenburg and Princess
Margaret of Hesse. The "Empress wore a
gown of white taffeta silk embroidered
with large flowers. Her corsage was cut
low and â¢" ornamented diamonds
Upon her head was a diadem of diamonds
and about her neck a necklace of rubies
and brilliants. ; '
X.RAYS IX SURGERY.
Leaden Fell eta Located and Removed
From a Young Man's Hand. .
BERLIN, Germany, Feb. 16. â Baron
yon Beuol-Berenberg, President of the
Reichstag, issued invitations last week to
the Ministers, members, of the Reichstag,
the Bundesrath and the German press to
be present at a special exhibition of the
Roentgen jays, which was given by Pro
fessor Spiess in the session hall of the
Reichstag on Thursday. The great hall
was crowded and most of the Ministers
were present.
Professor Spiess, after making a number
of experiments, delivered an explanatory
address in which he suggested that sci
ence would soon be so developed that one
would be able to photograph the contents
of secret documents through the letter
boxes. The only means of safety the Min
isters had, he said, was to use letter-boxes
made of lead.
Professor Bergmann, the eminent Ger
man surgeon, performed the first surgical
operation in the hospitals here through
the use of the Roentgen rays. The pro
fessor extracted a number of pellets which
had been for a long time imbedded in the
hand of a young man. The position of the
pellets, which had previously been probed
for without success, was made known
through the medium of the rays. Professor
Bergmann told the medical students who
witnessed the operation that while the
discovery of the rays was a welcome addi
tion to surgical diagnosis it could not be
compared in respect of usefulness to the
recent achievements attained by the use
of .the antiseptic discoveries of Professor
Esmarck. Foreign objects in the human
body which were not a source of trouble,
he says, ought to be left there, especially
in cases where an operation would be
dangerous.
STRIKES IX GERMAXY.
Tailors Rebel Against Starvation Wages
in the "Sweatshops."
BERLIN, German, Feb. 16.â The male
tailors have struck against starvation
wages and bad treatment generally, and
the Government has taken the side of the
strikers, male and female, the female tail
ors and seamstresses having gone out sev
eral days ago. The employers of these
workers are mostly "sweaters."
The Vorwaerts, in an article on the
strikes, cautions the strikers against com
mitting excesses, which, it warns them,
will weaken the public sympathy which
they now have almost unanimously.
Eight incendiary fires have occurred
within a short period in the populous
Moabit district of Berlin, and the in
habitants of the city are greatly alarmed
thereat. Several arrests of supposed in
cendiaries have been made, but as yet
there is no direct evidence against them.
In each case combustible material satu
rated with petroleum has been found in
the buildings set on fire. The fires are at
tributed to anarchists, and the police be
lieve that the incendiaries are working
conjointly with a number of their asso
ciates who act as claimants of the 300
marks' reward which is given for the dis
covery of a fire.

QUIET SABBATH
AT FRANKFORT.
Many Weary Solons Have

Homes.
PAIRED BEFORE LEAVING
Their Possible Indefinite Absence
Alarms the Steering
Committees. .
THE HUNTER FORCES ANXIOUS.
They Hold a Conference to Try to
Bring Back Bolters to the
; Fold.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 16.âFrank
fort enjoyed a more quiet Sunday to-day
than any Sabbath has been during this
session of the Legislature. But four of
the members have remained in town.
Some of those who left early yesterday
arc making their first visit home since
they came, and once there the temptation
to remain over a while may cause a com
motion among the members of the steer
ing committees to-morrow. Most of those
I leaving for home, however, provided for
| any such contingencies by arranging pairs
before they left. The men likely to be
caught "tardy are the fellows from the
mountain counties, who have long fides
from and to the nearest railroad stations,
and this is rather unfortunate for Dr.
Hunter, as most of them are of his party.
Their departure at '"is crisis with a
chance of not being on hand at Monday's
joint session is a strong indication that the
enthusiasm in his behalf is growing a little
cold, and the disposition to try to end the
long and unsatisfactory contest by sub
stituting another name for his is spread
ing.
As indicated in these dispatches a couple
of days ago, the likelihood is that alter
Monday's ballot there will be an effort
made to show what strength the name of a
new man will develop.
That man is pretty sure to be ex-Chief
Justice Holt. It is very certain that he
will get the vote of Representative Carroll
from Louisville, who is his son-in-law, and
possibly that of Mr. Poor, the Populist.
With these two additions and any short
age on the Democratic side he is elected.
But it is safe to predict that Mr. Carroll's
vote will hardly be cast for him if it is the
one to elect him. So it is a difficult matter
to make any forecast of the result as far as
Holt is concerned. Judge Burnett might
secure the votes of both the Populists, Ed
rington and Poor. His attitude on the
Goebel bill makes his candidacy dangerous
to the bill, as it points to some trading in
which the fate of the bill in the House is
involved. '.â 'â¢â â '.â¢/â¢
That some plan is being laid to-day in
Louisville to end the Senatorial contest is
well assured, but it will not be developed
till Tuesday or Wednesday unless the sit
uation to-morrow offers the opportunity
of electing Hunter or Blackburn. Gen
eral Echols and his able lieutenants are
not idle to-day, you may be sure. And
the matter of whether Kentucky shall
have a Republican Senator for the first
time in the history of the party or Joe
Blackburn be sent back to his old seat, is
of small importance to them, in compari
son with the question of the repeal of the
Southern Pacific charter.
In spite of the opposition of the Louis
ville Democratic dailies Blackburn is
stronger to-day by reason of the dissatis
faction in the Republican ranks with the
Hunter prospect than he was the first day
of toe balloting. With Hunter's weaken
ing additional efforts are being made to
bring the sound-money men into line for
Blackburn.
The influence of Secretary Carlisle has
been invoked to induce them to stand to
the caucus nominee. If Carlisle consents
to act in the matter he may influence
some, but hardly change Weissinger or
Carroll. The former is too obstinate and
the latter too much under the influence of
the Courier-Journal, which never gives up
a fight till it is beatenâ when it first up
braids the treachery of its opponents and
then blacklists them. x
With a full attendance and Weissinger
and Carroll still refusing to dress up to
the Democratic line, Blackburn can't well
win, but Bronston, Goebel and his other
leaders are very full of resources and there
is no telling what will happen.
Weissinger's persistent obstinacy is good
for the Goebel bill, as he is antagonizing
the Blackburn men more and more, and
his opposition to it will only serve to make
them support it.
To-morrow will probably show some
thing of the plans of both sides.
THE HUNTER MEN' UNEASY.
An Effort to Re Made to Bring Back the
Bolters. \
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 16.â A con
ference was held by the Hunter forces to
night for the purpose of trying to bring
back the bolters to the Hunter fold. It is
reported that a proposition was made to
them that if they would come back and
try to secure Hunter's election for another
week, at the end of that time Hunter
would be withdrawn and his strength
thrown to Judge Holt. Senator Rum

ning Hunter off the track, but it is not be
lieved that he will attempt such a proposi

Judge Holt, it is claimed, can secure one

EXPLOSION IX A SATCHEL.
An Officer Injured While Testing a Safe-.
; : . Cracker's Nitro- Glycerine.
OMAHA, Neb., Feb." 16.â At Papillion,
just south of .Omaha, last night, the City
Marshal saw two men /acting suspiciously
and tried with four assistants to arrest
them. I. They : , fled I with a satchel, \ which
they at length dropped. An exchange of
shots occurred, but the robbers escaped. ;S;
The satchel was found to contain a fine
kit of . burglar tools and a filled water
bottle. The bottle was cautiously placed
near a creek and a shot fired into it. The
earth was ; shaken for several hundred
yards, all the windows in the neighbor
hood were broken and the man who shot
the revolver was so badly injured that he
cannot recover for some weeks, The fluid
was pronounced to be nitroglycerine, and
the escape from a calamity is regarded as
miraculous.
A search is being made for the burglars,
who intended, it is believed, to rob the
Bank of Papillion.
FJ.URE IS REASSURED.
France's President. Xotified That the
Cabinet Will Xot Resign.
PARIS, France, Feb. IG.â Prime Minis
ter Bourgeois this afternoon visited the
Palace of the Elysee and informed Presi
dent Faure that the Cabinet had decided
unanimously not to resign in consequence
of the two votes in the Senate blaming the
Government for the appointment of Judge
Poitevin to conduct the inquiry into the
Southern Railway scandal. The Ministers
held that the vote of confidence adopted
by the Chamber of Deputies on the same
interpellation that led to the adverse vote
in the Senate was sufficient justification
for them to remain in office. The Cabinet
will hold another meeting on Tuesday.
Suspends the Diet's Sitting.
TOKIO, Japan, Feb. 16.â The Emperor
has sent a message to the Diet suspending
its sitting for ten days. When the mes
sage was received the Diet was discussing
the situation growing out of the recent
revolution in Korea, which resulted in the
murder of the Prime Minister and other
officials and the King's taking refuge in
the Russian legation.
JACKSON LEADS THE WAY.
Officers Shown to the Spot
Where Pearl Bryan Met
Death.
The Negro Driver's Strange Story
Discredited in His former
Home.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Feb. 16.â George
Jackson, the negro driver'who claims to
have driven Jackson, Walling and Pearl
Bryan to the scene of the Fort Thomas
murder, was put into a conveyance this
morning and told to drive over the same
route he followed on that fatal night.
With him went a large party of detectives
and newspaper men.
Jackson drove the vehicle over a deso
late route, through mud and brush, and
finally stopped a short distance from
where the headless body was found; then,
taking a by-path, he led the party directly
to the spot. His wonderful accuracy in
picking his way through the woods in the
dark, coupled with his identifying the
prisoners last night in a crowd of forty
men, lends color to his story, which is
only discredited by his continued silence
for nearly two weeks while the country
was talking of the crime.
Mullen, the livery stable man from
whom the negro Johnson claims the sur
rey he drove Jackson and Walling with
their victim to the scene of the murder,
finds by reference to his books that the
vehicle was rented out on the night of the
murder. An examination of the surrey
to-night disclosed what is believed to be
blood stains in the bottom on the seat. A
small bead, exactly like the ones on Pearl
Bryan's hat, was also found in the bottom
of the surrey.,- , -.-:,
Sentiment is divided as to faith in Jack
son's statements, but nobody accepts it !
without hesitation. . v . Â ; . ;
SPRINGFIELD, Ohio, Feb. 16.â George
H. Jackson, the negro who claims to have
driven the cab that carried Pearl Bryan to
death, lived here until about the middle of j
October. He was, up to about that date,
hostler for Dr. A. H. Vance. Chief of Po
lice Van Tassel, together with the family
of Dr. Vance, regard Jackson's story as a |
"fake," knowing as they do his reputation
M a seeker after notoriety.
Jackson, only a few days before he left !
here for Cincinnati, showed up at police
headquarters and told a wild tale about j
being held-up shortly after midnight by j
William Melvin, while on his way home
from a lodge meeting.
The evidence secured showed that at the
time Melvin wa3 in "Washington Court
house, and that a watch Jackson claimed
had been stolen was here in one of the
pawnshops.
Police Court Bailiff Johnson stated to
night that there is a charge hanging over
Jackson here now for embezzlement, pre
ferred by a lodge he belongs to, the United
Brethren of Protection.
Major Hoover, a well-known citizen, said
to-night in commenting on Jackson's
story: "Jackson's story is simply absurd.
Why should Doc Jackson and Walling in
crease their danger by dragging a third
and unknown party into the plot, and es
pecially when he was not needed?"

AWFUL DANGER.
A Voracious Donkey's Diet
Upon Dynamite Causes
a Furor.
FEAR A CATASTROPHE.
The Beast Is Swathed in Cotton
to Prevent a Threatened
Explosion.
OBLIVIOUS OF HIS DANGER.
Crowds Flee in Terror When the Liv
ing Bomb Attempts to Rollâ
End Is Not Yet.
MILL VALLEY, Cat.., Feb. 17.â 1t is not
often that a common long-eared donkey
manages to create excitement, but one be
longing to Charles Dowd ate three sticks
of dynamite on Friday and Mill Valley has
been in a state of terror'ever since. Con
trary to expectation, however, the animal
by his good behavior has prevented an ex
plosion, but the end may not be yet.
Mr. Dowd wished to get rid of an un
sightly stump in the rear of his home, as it i
encumbered tbe recreation grounds of his
donkeys and interfered with their playful
gambols. He bored holes in the stump
and left three sticks of dynamite on it
while he went to procure the necessary
fust. |
Benjamin Harrison, a donkey of rare in
telligence and of a not inquiring turn of
mind, carefully noted the preliminary op
erations. Although it was known that he
had just masticated the remains of a dis
carded boot and chewed up three tomato
cans, his voracity was not appeased, and
he swallowed the dynamite. Mr. Dowd
appeared in time to see the last stick dis
appear down Benjamin's throat.
Consternation seized upon Mr. Dowd.
In a few minutes a crowd assembled, and
it was feared the donkey might blow up.
Never was an animal treated with such
care and attention. The donkey seemed
to enjoy the deference and awe with which
he was viewed, until copious volumes of cold
water were poured down his throat to "put
his inside out," as a late importation from
the old country remarked. Another man
caused dismay and confusion by stating
that nitro-glycerine was exploded by con
cussion and not by fire.
Mr. Dowd, who was about to admonish
Benjamin with the butt end of a cluo for
his indiscretion, was disarmed for a blow
upon the carcass of the animal meant the
dismemberment of the donkey and the !
destruction of the surrounding precinct.
Careful hands moved Ben around and he J
was wrapped in huge wads of the softest
cotten until his ears alone were visible j
about the pile. At one time he showed a j
disposition to roll and the crowd sought ]
safety in flight, expecting every moment i
to see the animal explode and tear up the
earth.
Heavy doses of Epsom salts alternated
with castor oil have been given the animal,
and it is hoped Mill Valley has been
spared a destructive explosion.
Nearly two days have passed since Ben- :
jamin Harrison partook of the unnutri- j
cious but elevating diet, and the looked j
for explosion has not come. Fear has j
not subsided, however, and the donkey is I
threatened with asphyxiation because of
the wagon-load of material with which his
stall has been lined to prevent the disas
trous consequences that would follow if he
decided to rub himself against a rafter.
To-morrow, if he still lives, he will be led
to a distant pasture, where he can mcdi- j
tate in solitude until the danger is past.
MILL VALLEY'S NEW CHURCH.
Work to Be Commenced on the Building
in a Short lime.
MILL VALLEY, Cal.. Feb. 16.â At a
meeting of the building committee of the
Congregational Church at this place it was
decided to commence work on the new
church building in a short time, and bids
will be asked for labor and material. The
committee is composed of Rev. John Rea,
Alonzo Coffin and G. D. Avery. The
money necessary to build the church has
been subscribed by Mill Valley people, and
the Tamalpais Land and Water Company
has donated an excellent lot in a fine loca
tion. Rev. Mr. Rea, the pastor of the
church, says it is the intention to build a
most artistic edifice.
PEACE MEASURES URGED
The London Times Advocates the
Creation of a British
Commission.
Its Prospective Duties Similar to Those
of the Body Appointed by
Mr. Cleveland.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 16.â Times in
its issue of to-morrow will deprecate the
intention of the opposition to raise a de
bite in the House of Commons on the re
lations between Great Britain and the
United States. In the course of its article
it will plead for a moderate delay and that
no attempt be made to hurry a settlement,
and instances the advantages that will
accrue from following its advice.
President Cleveland, it will add, first
called upon Congress to appoint a com
mittee to determine the true divisional
line between British Guiana and Vene
zuela. Embassador Bayard now says the
commission's only function is to collect
facts or the information of the President.
The former pretensions received unani
mous rejection in this country. It was in
response to the latter view of the duties of
the commission that Lori Salisbury prom
ised to furnish the British documents to
the commission.
The Times believes it would be an ad
vantage if the British case were examined
by a strong independent commission, to
be appointed by the British Government,
the report of which would be available for
the instruction of Parliament and public
opinion as early as the report of the Amer
ican commission. In the mean lime, if
Venezuela should be willing to negotiate
direct, Great Britain would welcome her
advances.
Clements R. Markham, president of the
Royal Geographical Society, sends another
letter to the Times, which will be pub
lished to-morrow, amplifying his previous
communication to that paper. He says
that when he mentioned the map of the
French geographer. Danville, published
in 1748. giving the whole basin of the Esse
quibo River to Holland, he was not aware
of an important fact. He quoies from
Lugrin's manuscript history of Guiana
and from tt.e New York Herald of January
20, saying that the map was based on
authentic documents furnished to him by
the court of Spain. Mr. Markham regards
this as decisive. '
CAPTURED IX MEXICO.
Long Search for a German Criminal Enda
in Ilia Arrest.
ST. LOUIS. Mo., Feb. 16. -A special
from Coatzacoalcos, Mex., says: Her
man Bielmann, a German, has been ar-
rested on a plantation ninety miles south
of here on the charge of robbing a busi
ness louse of Hamburg, Germany, of the
sum of $50,000. Application has been
made for his extradition and he will be
taken to Germany as soon as it is granted.
Bielman came to Mexico five years ago
and claimed to be an Austrian. He was
possessed of much wealth and purchased
a tract of land upon which he has planted
coffee trees. He was traced to this coun
try by an English detective.

had been dead several hours.
Rohlfing was shot below the heart by
the woman while in the office and had

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1896.
JESSE POTTER
MUST RESIGN.
The Executor of the Charles
Lux Estate in an Awk
ward Fix.
THAT PERJURY CHARGE.
The German Heirs Object to His
Appointing His Own
Successor.
WEIGHTY POINTS TO CONSIDER.
Messrs. Campbell and Delmas Sup
posed to Be Masteis of the
Situation.
REDWOOD CITY, Cap., Feb. 16.â Jesse
Sheldon Potter's condition at the present
time, so far as his executorship of the
Charles Lux estate is concerned, is a very
peculiar one. It is almost certain that his
resignation as executor has been tendered
to Judge Buck, but that no official action
has been taken for the reason that the re
signation must first be accepted by the
German heirs of the Charles Lux estate,
through J. 11. Campbell, their counsel,
with whom D. M. Delmas is associated in
the suit against Potter. ,
The probable resignation of Jesse Potter
was outlined several weeks ago in an arti
cle published in The Call, when it became
known in a quiet way that Potter had
committed perjury in testifying to the
John Brown $800 draft and it is reported ;
that several days ago Attorney E. S. Pills
bury sent in Potter's conditional resigna
tion to Judge Buck, the condition being
that Potter's attorneys should name his
successor.
It is said that upon receipt of this sug
gestion Judge Buck made a break for the
telegraph office and notified Mr. Pillsbury
and afterward his local representative, Mr.
George C. Ross of Redwood City, that he
was not running a brokerage office and
that the matter as represented would not
be considered.
On Thursday last, when Messrs. Camp
bell and Delmas appeared in court to
make a motion to open the depositions re
lating to the Sadie Young incident, out of
which the perjury charge against Jesse
Poiter grew. Attorney E. S. Pillsbury was
conspicuous on account of his absence. In
his place Attorney Garret W. McEnerney
conducted Potter's case, and claimed that
the perjury charge was not an issue in the
Potter removal suit, and that even the
truth of that allegation could not affect
his client.
D. M. Delmas, on behalf of the German
heirs, contended otherwise, and insisted
upon opening the depositions, but Judge
Buck refused to grant the request of coun
sel for the time being, and took the mat
ter under advisement, but said that in his
final decision he should hold that Jesse
Potter had committed perjury.
On the following dayâ Fridayâ Messrs.
Delmas and Campbell made a new play by
filing notice of a motion to reopen the Pot
ter trial on February 20. All the dam
aging depositions relating to the Sadie
Young incident were riled at the same
time, and thus made a part of the record.
On Friday, also, there was a great com
motion in Redwood City. A couple of the
Lux heirs were in town, and an effort was
being made to reach their attorney, J. 11.
Campbell, by telephone, in which, how
ever, they wer.3 not successful. James D.
Byrnes of San Mateo, who is said to be
looked upon with favor by the German
heirs as Jesse Potter's successor, was also
in town all day in consultation with his
own attorney. It was reported that Pot
ter's unconditional resignation as executor
had just been received, and that it only
needed Attorney Campbell's acceptance,
when Mr. Byrnes would be appointed in
Jesse Potter's place and immediately
qualify on his bond.
But just here a hitch occurred. There is
i such a thing as parceling out the plums of
a big fat estate in too much of a hurry. It
is necessary to know where you stand, so
that the conditions upon which a new ex
ecutor will serve must be satisfactory to
the people who appoint him. He must be
hedged around with certain restrictions.
Therefore it would not do to accept Potter's
resignation until all these matters were
nicely . arranged. And there the whole
proposition rests.
; If the reopening of the Potter removal
suit next Thursday should be insisted upon
by Messrs. Delmas and Campbell, one
theory is that the testimony introduced
might be placed in better shape upon
the records and have a bearing
on the various Miller & Lux suits now
being waged, including the accounting suit
against Henry Miller, the settlement of
the Charles Lux estate and the complicated
condition of the Miranda W. Lux litiga
tion.
Messrs. Campbell and Delmas are just
now supposed to be absolute masters of
the situation. It is possible that Potter's
resignation may be accepted and officially
announced on Monday, and. again it may
be held in abeyance. The watchword
is, when Potter's resignation does come,
look out for the appointment of James D.
Byrnes. â 
THRASHED BY A JUDGE.
His Honor Triea the Case in Which He
: . Is Defendant.
PULLMAN, Wash., Feb. 16.â A peculiar
case has been on the docket in Justice G.
P. Gammon's court. Last Thursday morn
ing Irvin Griffith swore out a warrant for
the arrest of S. A. Robinson and George
Milam, charged with assault with intent to
commit robbery. The case came up for
trial the same day. For three days the
trial continued and was closed last even
ing by Prosecuting Attorney Matthews
moving that Gammon was unfit to sit on
the case, for his connection therewith was
so immediate that it would be impossible
for â  him to give the prisoners a fair hear
ing, the evidence having pointed to his
association with the defendants in the
crime.
Tuesday morning Griffith came into town
and got drunk. After supper he went into
the billiard hall and amused the boys by
calling out "Gammon, Gammon)" which
irritated his Honor so that he slapped
Griffith's face. Griffith and Gammon had
trouble a few weeks previous. Not satisfied
with slapping the drunken man, Gammon
persuaded Robinson and Milam to take
Griffith out behind the McConnell-Cham
bers building and hold him while he chas
tised him. When , Griffith reappeared his
face and head were all bloody and bruised.
He at once recognized Robinson and Milam
as two of his assailants.
Justice Gammon confessed before Attor-'
ney Matthews that he "was guilty of assault
upon Griffith, and at once tried to com
promise the matter.
THE KILBRAXXAX.
Six Powerful Tugs Fail to Move Her More
Than Eight Feet.
PORT TOWNSEND. Wash., Feb. 16.â
With six powerful tugs pulling, all her
extra weight in spars and Ballast removed
and exceptionally favorable weather, the
British ship .Kilbrannan, which went
ashore in a squall ten days ago at Point
Wilson lighthouse is only eight feet nearer
deep water. The attempt to float her was
made at daybreak this morning, but had
to be stopped when the big tug Tyee
grounded and had to be pulled into deep
water by the others.
It is understood that another attempt
will be made to-morrow morning, and as
that is the highest tide of the month, if
the Kilbrannan is not floated she will re
main on the shingle beach until the big
tides of April and May. Beyond the
strain on the vessel and a' few small holes
which had been punctured in her bottom
the vessel is still uninjured and will re
main so unless severe weather comes.
SAXTA CRUZ'S SHORT ROBBER.
He Relieved Chester Ware of $10 at So-
quel Saturday Night.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Feb. 16.â The road
agent, who is known around here as the
"short robber," again made his appear
ance last night, this time at Soquel. He
presented his white-masked face again to
Chester Ware on a roadway and demanded
his money. Ware emptied his pockets,
and the robber, though disappointed that
the silver did not amount to $10, seemed
satisfied and decamped. Either this or
some other man has been hounding the
neighborhood of Soquel and Capitola, with
an occasional visit to Santa Cruz for two
weeks. The officers think they are on the
track of him.

FISHING AT SANTA CRUZ
No Diminution of the Salmon
Catch in the Smooth Waters
of the Bay.
Commissioners Emeric and Murdoch
He ok Sixteen Beauties â Many
Visitors in Town.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Feb. 16.â H. A.
Kmeric and W. C. Murdoch, Fish Com
missioners, who came down from San
Francisco last evening to tempt the salmon
of these waters, spent to-day on the bay,
and came in at 5 o'clock with sixteen as
fine salmon as were ever hooked. The fish
averaged smaller in size to-day than yes
terday. The Commissioners took the big
gest one that was taken to-day. It weighed
nineteen pounds. Their catch of eixteen
aggregated about 150 pounds. The day's
fishing aggregated for the twenty boats
about 250 fish. The largest catch, number
ing twenty-two, was taken by the boat of
Perez, a local fisherman.
The day was beautiful, and the bay was
as smooth as a floor. Nearly every boat
contained vistors from other cities and
towns, who are agreed that there is an
enormous run of salmon and that the re
ports have not been exaggerated. But the
local fishermen say the immense size of
the fish taken yesterday plainly indicated
that to-day's catch would diminish.
The fact is that these big fish have driven
the sardines off the feeding-grounds and
the smaller salmon have followed them.
The presence of those California whales
during the week also made inroads on the
sardines and there maybe a diminution in
the run for a day or two, yet they may
come in again to-morrow.
But everybody who was out to-day
called it good fishing. Two hundred and
fifty fish for twenty boats they thought a
very lively day's sport.
It is the general opinion that there is
going to be finer fishing at Santa Cruz in
May or June than there is now. Many of
the fish have been examined very critically
and the indications are plain enough that
they will not leave before October.
Both the Commissioners said they had
enjoyed the sport greatly to-day and were
satisfied that Santa Cruz had all the fish
that had been claimed, though the stories
seemed large on paper. They have shipped
their fish to the Fish Commissioners", 79

The Junkmen Surprised Mi

VALLEJO, Cal., Feb. 16.â Nearly a
hundred mechanics of all classes employed
for some time past on the monitor Monad
nock have been discharged within the
last two days from the department of con
struction and repair, and the coming week
many more will meet a similar fate. It is
even stated that the entire number by
February 28 will reach nearly 500 men.
The outlook is not cheering for them to
again resume work until after the fiscal
year, beginning July next, the bnlk of
the money having become exhausted and
the completion of the Monadnock being
given out as the cause. To enable the
monitor to be completed by Saturday
night, the men have been working both
day and night. Her crew being here, she
will go into commission the 20th instant,
and will be ready for actual service shortly
after.
The homeward bound men from the
Baltimore left for New York on the 13th
by the Sunset route. This route was
selected by the chief of the bureau of
navigation, Admiral Ramsay, on account
of the climatic conditions.
No matter which route was selected the
Government would be obliged to pay for
their transportation, as in the transporta
tion of men over the Southern Pacific and
Union Pacific roads the act of Congress
does not specify that the naval branch of
the service shall be so carried and their
transportation credited against the ac
count of the roads. It only refers to
"troops," meaning the army. Before the
order was issued to send the men by the
Sunset route Admiral Ramsay procured a
ruling on this pomt â or at least so it is
given out Here by competent authority.
At 1 o'clock Monday the flag of the Bal
timore will be lowered and the white
cruiser will go out of commission. All of
her stores have been taken ashore and the
crew, such as desire to remain on the
coast, have been paid off. A number of
her officers will leave immediately for the
East on leave of absence for three months,
which means a season of rest, recreation
and home enjoyments, which to a sea
faring man after a two or three years'
cruise in foreign waters is always looked
forward to with a sense of delight.
Even those who are stationed at Mare
Island, with all its pleasant features, look
forward to the time for their return to
Washington and Eastern points to again in
dulge in a season of gaycty. To them this
station is looked upon as being what is
termed a "foreign station," as it is so far
located from the seat of Government.
Those, however, who have been on the
"slope" for years desire to remain, as they
find many charms not to be found else
where. â¢ ,
The hills where much hay and grain at
times are raised now look green and re
freshing to the eye after the rains, and the
outlook is good for a bountiful yield. This
helps to weather the stock-horses owned
by the Government and helps to pay for
the cultivation of the farming lands, em
bracing many hundreds of acres.
On the 15th and 16th sealed bids for con
demned property were opened at the pay
master's office in the presence of scores of
men of almost all nationalities who
gathered to see what they won among the
hundred or more bidders from all sections
of the Union. The prices varied as much
if not more than the nationalities. An
article that one thought by his bid to be
not worth- more than two bits ranged to
$20 or $30. The prices exceeded by far that
of two years ago, the cash deposits being
more than $20,000. It will be a month be
fore the old junk is removed from the
yard and the accounts closed.
The old stores turned in and to be con
demned from the Baltimore will of them
selves form the nucleus for another sale
next year.
The Swatara has been hauled under the
crane to have her boilers and engines
hoisted out to get her in readiness for dis
posal in the same fashion under sealed
bids. -
The machine-shop of the yards and
docks is gradually becoming more com
plete by the addition of machinery from
the department of equipment. This is as it
should be, as work is continually under
way in the department, and it has never
been provided with the necessary amount
of machinery owing to lack of funds at the
bureau's disposal for purchase of the
same.
Considerable strife is manifested for the
purchase of the ferry franchise from Val
lejo to Mare Island, Over $10,000 will
likely be given the city lor the privilege of
operating the system for the next twenty
years.
It looks as though an appropriation will
be made for improvement of the water
front and to build a seawall from the old
Monadnock wharf to South Vallejo on
what is known as the "Phelps line." -If
this work is accomplished it will be a sav
ing to - the Government in the matter of
dredging expenses, which is no small sum,
and keep the channel clear at all times.
Much astonishment was expressed,
though it was in everybody's mouth, that
the matter of the rejection of a lot of pork
barrels, while the contents were found to
be good, should reach the public
ear through the medium of the press.
Still, in a nice, quiet little nook under the
shade of a great big hill, the work of re
packing goes : steadily on and a better lot
of barrels are being used.
The inspection board has considerable
work to do in seeing that the Government
is not imposed upon by unscrupulous deal
ers, though, to their credit and ; honor, the
great majority of California dealers furnish
their goods up to the standard. ,. .2; .]. ,

ISS AND OUTS AT WAR.
First Baptist Church Members at Day-
ton. Wash., in Conflict.
DAYTON, Wash., Feb. 16.â The trouble
which has been brewing between the two
factions of the First Baptist Charch here
culminated this morning when five of the
"outs" forced the door and ejected four of
the "ins" who were holding possession for
the time being. Bodwell, one of the eject
ors, received a scalp wound, and Madison
Booth, jne. of the fortified party, was
kicked while being dragged out.
One arrest has been made and more
trouble is imminent. The ejectors are the
members who held possession until Tues
day last, when the old faction who built
the church secured peaceable possession
and have held it since. The new faction
to-day removed the seats and the courts
will settle the matter. The trouble arose
from the minor matter of the appropria
tion of the proceeds of a dime social.

Leslie Drew Breaks Through the
Ice While Skating and
Perishes.
The First Misfortune to Mar the
Pleasures of the Winter
Carnival.
TRTJCKEE, Cal., Feb. 16.â One carload
of tourists visited the carnival to-day.
The majority went to Tahoe in sleighs
while the others occupied their time skat
ing and tobogganing.
Dormer Lake was entirely frozen over
this morning and it was soon known that
the lake afforded good skating. Skating
on Marzens pond was also reported good.
Accordingly devotees of this sport slung
their skates over their shoulders and were
soon wending their way toward the pond
and lake.
About 2 o'clock a messenger came to
town with the news that several skaters
had broken through the ice and were
drowned. The town went wild with ex- I
citement and wagons loaded with men
were soon hurrying toward the lake. A
short time later a man came in and from ;
him it was learned that Fred Cook, Orrin j
Barton, Fred Drew. Leslie Drew and two
others had fallen through the ice.
After some difficulty all had succeeded
in reaching a place of safety with the ex
ception of Leslie Drew, who was still j
in the water struggling with the ;
ice. Men attempted to rescue him, but |
! owing to the thinness of the ice could not i
i reach the unfortunate lad. Poles were |
j thrown to him, but he was too weak to \
grasp them and soon sank out of sight. A I
boat was procured and dragged over the j
I ice to the broken spot, but nothing could i
j be seen of young Drew. The lake was j
! dragged with hooks until dark without j
! success and will be resumed to-morrow.
Leslie Drew was a boy of 15 years and i
attended public school here. His mother, j
who is visiting relatives in Carson City, is
heartbroken over the unfortunate affair.
Still Xo Trace of Mrs. Cody.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 16.â A. B. Cody j
and a party of searchers to-day explored
about thirty miles of the â¢ beach in the vi
cinity of Tacoma in a steam launch with- I
out finding any sign of his missing wife or !
her garments. The search was simply j
made to satisfy relatives, for few believe
Mrs. Cody has committed, suicide or is
drowned.
Another one of the almost innumerable
telegrams locating the missing/woman was
received to-day. This time she was sick at
the Columbia Hotel. Shoshone, Idaho.
After telegraphing back and forth some
time she was proven to be another woman.

The Blnerock Contest Was a Feature
of the Dayâ List of Entries
and Scores.
STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. There was a
large gathering of gun-club men at Good
water Grove to-day. The shooting began
at 10 o'clock and continued until 4, and in
every shoot the entries were full.
Fifty dozen pigeons had been provided
for the occasion, and records did not stand
in the way of participation in the sport, as
the contests were so many one could
always find an opening.
In the live-bird shoot it was free to all,
and no team : shooting was done. The
bluerock shoot was the principal feature of
the competitive portion of tbe programme,
and some good records were made. The
Olympic Club of San Francisco sent up a
good delegation, and the club's team car
ried off the trophy, which was a handsome
cup. The score was shot on a possible
twenty rocks.
The team entries and scores were as fol
lows:
Olympicâ Kuedner, 16; N'auman, 18; Webb,
20. Team score, 54. Webb was the only man
in the contest to make a full score.
Stockton Athletic' Association Clubâ Haas,

score, 50.
Antioch Ren free, 10; Raso, 18; Proc

There was an informal shoot on ties
after the close of the team score, but no
records were made. The Stockton men
think they could have held the Olympic
people down had it not been for Webb,
and in spite of beine handicapped by a di
vision into several clubs. The contest was
under the rules of the Inanimate Asso

Fire-Mile Cycle Handicap.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Feb. There was a
large crowd at the East San Jose course
this morning to witness the five-mile
handicap road races of the San Jose Road
Club and the Columbus Cycling Club,
there being half an hour's wait between
the races. The handicapping was good,
and both races proved interesting.
The San Jose Road Club race attracted
considerable interest on account of the fact
that it is one of a series of races being held
for the purpose of developing a fast team
for the great relay race in April.
The race was a fast one, and the finish
between Floyd McFarland and Ted Belloli
was close. MoFarland won the race in
13:25 3-5, Belloli second in 13:26. The
other starters and the handicaps
and the order in which they fin
ished were: J. J. Carroll (:40) 14:10 2-5;
M. J. O'Brien (0:50), 14:27; H. S. Beach
(1:00), 14:42; R. Hammonds (scratch).
13:52; George Bell (0:30). 14:53; Walter
Harris (1:00), 15:04. John Wing started
from scratch but did not finish.
The five-mile handicap race of the Co
lumbus Cycling Club also proved an inter
esting event. The race is the fourth of a
series for a gold medal. J. Hourtieg, with
a handicap of 1:45, won the race in 16:3-1;
J. Ferro (0:30), second. F. Cianciarulo
(scratch) was third and won the time prize
in 15:52. Z. Kunhardt was fourth in
16:33. Schiele and Spinetti failed to finish.

THE CITY OF SALEM, OREGON.
BY THE SECRETARY OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.
SALEM, Ok.. Feb. 15.â Salem is the
Queen of the Willamette Valley, the land
of beauty, prosperity and destiny.
No true friend of Salem wishes to dis
parage any other region of our own land.
We have a great and prosperous country,
and the prosperity of every part is the de
sire of every true American. The happi
ness of one section is the happiness of
l BE CITY HALL AT SALEM.
every other. But men are restless. In this
age and country they are especially so.
There are few who think they have found
the best location possible, or that they
have moved for the last time. The few
who are convinced in their own minds
that they have finally discovered the best
country on earth may well be expected to
preach the gospel of their convictions.
They naturally wish to see the undevel
oped resources of the land of their choice,
its advantages of soil and natural attrac
tiveness advertised to the world.
Of course this desire is not entirely tin-'
selfish. What desire is entirely unselfish?
Everyone expects to reap some benefit
from the growth of his own town and the
development of the region in which he
lives. Yet in all this he may not be purely
selfish. He may have a real desire to see
his fellows in distant regions better their
condition, and to see the region in which
he dwells prepared as nearly as possible
in his own time to confer its fullest bene
fits on coming generations.
To induce immigration by misstatements
or overstatements is fraud. And no spe
cies cf fraud should be more severely con
demned than that which would lure un
suspecting and honest people into an un
fruitful and worthless region by misstate
ments and delusive promises.
This is not a wild, unsettled region. As
a town Salem is now (1696) fifty-three
years old. Thirty-seven years she has
been the capital of a State. Some of the
lands tributary to the city have endured,
without showing any sign of failure, a half
century of steady cultivation. The coun
try is not untried. Our climate, soil and
general resources are well understood. We
guess at nothing. We wish to overstate
nothing. Salem is not a "bocm town,"
staked out on the prairie or . in the woods,
with no past and no future. Neither does
she depend lor her future on the will of
railroad companies or other greedy combi
nations of capital. We rely upon our lo
cation and natural resources and the
spirit and enterprise of our people.
Our advantages are natural, not artifi
cial. A goodly number of people, still
living, have known our climate through a
constant residence of from thirty to fifty
years. In all that time they have seen
nothing of dangerous or destructive
storms, nothing of withering cold. They
have seen no failure of crops in that half
century, or blighting Windsor grasshopper
plagues. They have seen a slow but
steady improvement in the development
of the country.with nothing to shake their
confidence in the brightness of its future.
Placing Salem in the center of a region
with a radius of twenty-live miles we have
an area of 2900 square 'miles. Not one
square mile of this entire area can be
properly designated as waste, arid or un
productive. There are sixty-six post
offices within its bounds, and outside of
Salem sixteen towns and villages ranging
in population from 200 to 2000. Salem
has a population of 15,000. The pop
ulation of the entire region is not
far from 45,000. Deducting the popular
tion of the towns and villages, we have an
agricultural population of not more than
25.000, or about ten persons to the square
mile; including the population of the
towns and villages, about twenty to the
square mile. Yet no one acquainted with
the agricultural, horticultural and manu
facturing capabilities of this magnificent
region will doubt for a moment its capa
city to sustain in comfort and prosperity,
and without crowding, a round half mil
lion of people. Multiply its present popu
lation by ten, and you will then* only
place it in position to begin that course of
industrial and social development to
which it is most certainly destined. For
every man, woman and "child, then, now
living within the limits named, we have
room, work and welcome for nine more.
Salem does not aspire to become a great
commercial center, although her situation
on" a transcontinental railway and on the
banks of a navigable river gives her easy
access to the markets of the world, and
makes it entirely possible for her to be
come a distributing center for agricultural
products and a center for arts ana manu
factures.
Paramount among our manufacturing
establishments are the Salem Woolen
mills (recently burned, but being rebuilt
with enlarged capacity), converting Ore
gon wool into textile "fabrics, aggregating
about $150,000 annually. The Salem Flour
ing-mills, with a capacity of 500 barrels
per day, and the Wallace Cannery, with
an annual output of 25,000 cases. ; ). '>.*â â ':.
a soap factory, two sash ana door fac
tories and two iron foundries, besides sev
eral smaller enterprises. Other enter
prises are on foot, and there is room for
still mor<\ A tine electric-power plant is
now in full operation, designed to furnish
power in any part of the city to any
amount, from one-sixth of a horse
power upward. This will enable small
manufacturers of all classes to locate on
cheap grounds and obtain safe and reli
able power at reasonable rates. Surround
ed as she is by a region capable of produc
ing every variety of grain, fruit or vege
table known to tbe temperate zone; hav
ing at her door every kind of raw material
in unlimited abundance; commanding
cheap and easy means of export for such
surplus as her own people do not consume,
it is difficult to see anything to prevent
Salem becoming a manufacturing and dis
tributing center of considerable im
portance. .

Salem is the county seat of Marion
County, and of course has all the county
buildings. The constitution of Oregon
requires all State institutions to be located
at the capital of the State. This reauire-
I nient secures to Salem permanently .the
State prison, insane asylum, reform school,
and the institutions for the deaf and blind.
All these institutions are now reasonably
well equipped, and are making frequent
additions and improvements .to their
buildings.
In educational advantages Salem is be
| hind no other city on the coast. There
are live public school buildings, four of
these of recent construction and exception-
I ally creditable in equipment and appear
ance. Willamette University, the oldest
institution of its class in the Northwest,
attracts students from a wide extent of
country. The Roman Catholics have a
; school for girls, the Academy of the Sacred
Heart. The Society of Friends have
! recently established a Polytechnic Insti
i tute in which it is designed to combine in
| dustrial and literary training. Kinder
( garten work is fairly started under the
! guidance of an association organized for
that purpose. There is also a well managed
business college.
Streets are wide and lined with beauti
ful shadetrees; residence lots are large, and
j there are two large public squares. Water
| and gas mains are laid throughout the
I city, and the streets are well lighted with
I electricity. In May, 1890, streetcars were
first operated by electricity. The system
was started with two cars on two miles of
road. There are twelve miles of this road
j well built and equipped, and the lines are
i being constantly improved and extended.
i They even now reach out into the garden
ing and fruit-raising districts, and com-
I fortable rural homes â¢ can be obtained
i within cheap, quick and easy reach of the
I business center of the city. Few people
i realize how largely these modern inven
| tions improve the possibilities of a place
j situated as Salem. Under the stimulus of
; these pleasant, safe and rapid means of
I transit there is practically no limit to its
! growth.
In a few years it will be hard to tell
i where the town ends and the country be-
I gins. Families can so locate as to enjoy
| all the freedom of a country home, and
j yet be within easy reach of the social life
! and business advantages of the city.
Though a half century old, Salem has
l just begun to be. The place will grow.
I It is growing. It has increased in popula
-1 tion at the rate of 25 cent a year the
j past four years. Our position is in a land
i of plenty and wonderful productiveness.
I Our merchants do not fail. Our banks, of
which we have four, are sound financial
J institutions. Not only suburban and rural
j homes can be obtained at moderate prices,

DEALS IT HARD BLOWS
Colonel ; Isaac Trumbo Denounces
the Huntington Fund*
..â¢â . in Bill.
WHY IT SHOULD BE DEFEATED.
It Would Arrest Development and
Subject the People to Any Toll the
â  ; Monopoly Might Impose. â¢.-â¢
Colonel Isaac Trumbo writes as follows
to the Salt Lake Herald concerning the
Southern Pacific and the funding bill:
The development of the entire West is
inseparably linked with the increase of its
railroad facilities. Even the free and un
limited coinage of silver will prove almost
useless to the commercial development
and industrial freedom of the great and
wealthy region lying west of the Rocky
Mountains unless freedom from railroad
domination comes with the other desired
condition. I am not of .those
who believe that all the evils .of
our industrial and commercial life are to
be banished by internal competition;
neither do I believe it always follows that
the more railroads we have the better we
are off. There is mischief always to the
public in the investment of capital in
directions where the plants already in
existence are equal to the performance of
all the demands of trade. All the compe
tition in the world will not reduce the cost
of production. It may cheapen ; prices,
but it does not reduce the cost of produc
tion. Hence, over-investment is largely
the same in effect as tinder-investment,
and the public is punished in both cases.
'\ It cannot therefore be said that in the
criticism now made by me on the railroad
situation in California and in all the States
west of and including Utah, the demand
is for competition independently of all ac
tual needs. '. , vr^wV?
The statement that corporations are not
interested in legislation in a Government
like ours, which in degree undertakes to
measurably insure a profit to the investor,
must be based upon . the presumption that
most people have little knowledge or give
little heed to what the Government is doing in
behalf of corporations. .
The Central Pacific is a case in point. It is
all the while asserted that the Central Pacific
Railroad has little or no interest in politics or
governmental affairs. -Yet that it has con
trolled the politics of California and of Nevada
for the last twenty years is as patent to those
willing to know as anything can be. Every
influence that can be brought to bear is ex
erted to protract its domination of the two
States named. > It holds California in a grip
that the people have been unable to loosen, do
what they could. It has corrupted the State
of California, for by means of its political
power, end by the power of the money unlaw-
fully taken by it from the producers and the
merchants of the State, it has been enabled to
coerce or purchase the assent of a majority of
the people to work its ends and to maintain its
victorious influence over one of the fairest
States in the Union. No merchant depending
on the railroad for goods can afford to join in
any movement against it, for the reason that
the road would discriminate against him and
ruin him root and branch. No public officer,
or no man ambitious for office, would think of
opposing it for the reason that it would spend
its money and use its influence to destroy him.
And now, while to the people of this great
State the relief prayed for for years is possible,
we find the inhabitants of adjoining States in
different to the needs of a silver State, or else,
aiding and abetting this corporation in the
perpetuation of its power over California.
In a general way the people of Utah. Idaho
and Arizona are interested in this great ques
tion quite as much as the people ot California,
for the reason that the growth of. all this
region depends on ability to get to' the
waters of the Pacific by some other line than
either the Union Pacific or the Central Pacific.
If this is doubted, let an v Western man explain
what hope for the West there is in the East
except to borrow back the money that has been
dug out of the mountains and washed from the
sands of the West, and which we have pre
sented to the East as a tribute for being al
lowed to be called part of this land of ours. .
Jf the present funding bill is passed in a
form acceptable to the railroads, then the
people of the West will have fastened on them
a domination that will destroy them and pre
vent the development of the country, and sub
ject its resources to the toll that the railroad
masters may feel disposed to impose. . If we
judge to what extent this toll will bo imposed,
we have but to recall what has been done in
the near as well as in the remote past. The
disposition ever has been to extort. While
there may be a change in the method of ex
tortion, in no wise will there be a change in
the disposition to extort. The fruit-growers
of the great State of California have seen the
employes of the railroad walk through their
thriving orchards as the fruit approached
maturity and value it and estimate what it
would bring in the Eastern markets.
Then the close cost of gathering it and plac
ing it on the cars has been figured. Then the
difference between the cost of harvesting and
the price the crop would bring in the market
where it could be sold would be fixed ; on the
cost of transportation. And the orchardlst is
compelled to submit to the extortion or see his
fruit rot in the baskets or fall - from the trees.
The whole of the State of California. is sub
jected to exactly this method of having the
fruits of its toil estimated. Whatever profit
there might be between the cost of production
and the selling value of the product the rail
road . with ready and relentless hand ever
takes.
An excuse is offered for much the railroads
in the West doâ mean that which is done by
the Pacific railroads, At the time of tneir con
struction all conditions were unfavorable to
the work. The country. was undeveloped, the
cost of materials was very high and the under
taking of crossing the great Rocky and Sierra
mountain ranges was considered will nign im
possible by the railroads. Capital at that time
in the hands of private individuals would not
.undertake the speculation, and those who had
the necessary confidence in the great work
lacked the money to begin 1 it, much less to
complete it. Government aid was - solicited,
and that the country might be united, by rail
Government credit was loaned to the scheme,
*?<* .colossal grants of land that have already
yielded untold wealth to the corporations, and
which are still unexhausted, were voted to en
courage the interest of private, capital in the
undertaking. Thousands of men who had
nothing but keen intellects when the construc
tion of the Union | Pacific and Central Pacific
railroads were commenced, have become great
financial powers in the Nation.
Out of the earnings of these people thousands
of miles of other roads have been constructed
and are the private property of the men for
merly poor. Investments in other directions
almost without limit have contributed to swell
infinitely the fortunes of these men. The cities
of San Francisco and Oakland are little less
than so much of their private property. They
own the street railway system there. The coal
that goes through California is from the mines
of these men. Never has a cent been returned
to the Government for the money advanced by
It for the construction of these roadsâ neither
in principal nor in interest. The lands aDd
their revenues have been diverted to the bene
fit of those who built the road on the Govern
ment credit. And every effort to have the
roads surrender to the Government has been
met with the determined opposition of those
who have become multi-millionaires through
the robbery of the people subject to the exac
tions of the road. It is said that Mr. Hunting
ton is prepared to spend $3,000,000 in order to
secure the passage of a bill that will leave the
railroad in his control. â¢
Now, the building of this road has cost a
good deal more than the plant is worth to-day.
And the excuse for the extortionate rates in
vogue in the management of the road is that
it cannot pay its bonds because the value of
the plant has gone down and it cannot meet
the competition of less expensive roads, nor
can it afi'ord to give the benefit of cheaper rates
to those compelled to trade with it because its
great cost makes high rates necessary. On this
plea and the further plea that, incidental and
other interests have crown up about the road
which are innocent of any offenses against the
Government, it is held that the road should be
permitted to remain in the hands of those that
began the work by a system of robbery and
who have never been able to escape the itch
then created and gratified to a point where no
limit can be fixed. The Credit Mobilier scan
dal has passed largely from the public mind,
but there was such a scandal connected with
the construction of the roadsâ a scandal which
only touched the very edge of the iniquity,
since there was hardly a contractor or an em
ploye of the road, in any capacity, that in one
form or another was not a partaker of some of
the benefits of 'he wholesale robbery that has
marked the full existence of the road, and
which also largely corrupted the people of the
whole country through which it has been ope
rated by its open purchase of men, by its domi
nation in politics, and by the example of great
respect and power and place bestowed upon
the most notorious of public corruptionists.
Great powers were placed in the hands of these
men which they have prostituted until a whole
State is under their feet. They punish all that
will not serve them, and bestow the rewards
upon those that do serve and protect them in
their infamies. Time and again men have
been sentenced to death as traitors to their
country lor offenses less than half as great as
these.
' If it were simply the question of permitting
these men to enjoy their profits without per
petuating a wrong on Calilornia it would mat
ter little what was done with the road. But
California is to be "kept under a domination
that has already made her pay for the road
time and again in the unlawful rates charged
for the handling of her natural products and
by the exorbitant charges for articles that had
to be imported by v rail.' But that she has a
great stretch of seaboard which has compelled
concessions the State would yet be almost as
backward as parts of Alaska and her citizens
would be all but the absolute slaves of the
railroad-owners and their property as much
subject to their tolls as the fruit-raisers now in
that State and as the property of serfs was
under. the old feudal barons.
This is a question that involves the liberty
and tbe property of the people of the most
blessed State in -the Union, so far as natural
resources are concerned, f It involves the de
velopment of all the wide region west of the
Colorado line. All those to be effected by the
result- of the passage of such a bill as Mr.
Huntington wants, '.should make common
cause with California and Nevada, that the
people may be freed from, the infamous con
trol of the unscrupulous men no determined
to maintain their. power by the purchase of the
, passage of such a bill as will suit them. Every
' Congressman or Senator who votes for any
measure receiving the support of Hunt
ington .may. be. - recognized as wearing
the collar.. of that road and of having
had financial- assistance from the corrupters
who by past robberies can now purchase a con
tinuation of the power to continue a system of
railroad extortion in the future and of the es
toppel and development in the railroad direc
tions for a long future. There shiuld be no
excuse. Every Western representative of the
people should be made to understand that his
political life and the respect of the community
are the prices he will pay for failing to vote so
as to secure to California and Nevada that lib
erty which is impossible while the present
high-handed corporation, domination shall
continue.
The only hope for the opening of a commer
cial highway to the Pacific Ocean from Utah is
through the defeat of the measure so earnestly
desired by the Central Pacific magnates. ..That
money will be spent lavishly and, that the peo
ple will be made to pay it back as a price of
their temerity in trying to secure both politi
cal and commercial liberty, may be assured.
The people of the whole Nation should be in
terested in this grave issue. No Nation is free
where part of its citizens are in slavery,
whether in factor in name. And the wrong
that has so long been practiced upon Califor
nia is a wrong that may come to the citizens
of any other State at any time by corporation
combinations. A blow at the bare-faced de
mands for the power of continued robbery
made by the Central Pacific is a blow struck in
behalf of the rights of people everywhere. It
is a step in defense of the right of "the fathers
and mothers of the Nation to have the ex
ample that only thieves are successful no
longer temptingly spread before their children.
The young life of the Nation is being corrupted
by wealth and political preferment, and all
these questions are directly. involved in the
issue now between the people of the West and
the Pacific railroads. Is it possible that the
citizens of other parts of the Nation are bo lost
to oil principle that they see no wrong and will
defend no right thing that does not directly
concern themselves? It is not so, and no lover
of his country can believe it. Yours.
Isaac Trumeo.
A SOUTH SEA HURRICANE
The Greatest Blow in Forty
Years Sweeps Over the
Friendly Islands.
Three Vessels Wrecked During the
Fury of the Destructive
Gales.
J. A. Magee of innepec arrived from
Samoa yesterday and is stopping at the
The Tonga or Friendly Islands, Which
Have Recently Been the Scene of a
Terrific Hurricane.
Bom House. He .is accompanied by his
wife and child. Mr. Magee brings quite a
budget of news from those far-away islands.
_ "The most frightful hurricane that ', has
visited any of the islands in the South Seas
for forty years is reported to have centered
about the Tonga group of â  the Friendly
Islands about January 2,"- said Mr. Magee
yesterday. "At Samoa we had very
meager; details up.to the time I left, but
it was known that three vessels had been
totally wrecked , together with a great
many, small fishing sloops. . â '.- 'â :'â  -â¢ .-;.â¢â¢
â¢ I "The Aeele, a schooner belonging at Apia;
and barks Woo Sung and West Australian
were destroyed! All of them were driven
over the coral reefs and left high and dry,
totally wrecked. The Aeele was in the ;
harbor of Haafeva and the others were at ;
Lifuka. The Woo Sung was a Danish vessel j
of about 600 tons, and the West Australian, j
about 900 tons, belonged at the' Colonies. !
They, were loading T with copra arid the j
West Australian had a cargo of 600 tons I
aboard, worth $24,000.
"The Tongan islands lie about 700 miles
south of the moan islands. They are
an independent group, with a population
of about 30,000. They have a very en
lightened and progressive native ruler,
King George. He has at- his capital a col
lege where the natives are taught the rudi
ments of learning. He requires his people
to be clad from neck to knees. Altogether
they are a very tractable and interesting
people. ..'.â â 
"At Samoa we felt no signs of the terrific
blow that took place there. But since
December the islands have been frequently
shaken by terrific earthquakes. There are
no buildings there that could be shaken
down, but the low one-story houses could
be seen to sway and the tremors per
ceptibly felt, while the crockery and
chinaware rattled together and fell from
their ; shelves. The most distinct Bhock
was felt on Christmas day.
"It is very . likely that this demonstra
tion was related to the blow and tidal
wave at the Friendly Islands."
~Mr. Magee tells, a pretty story about
Robert Louis Stevenson with whom he ;
was acquainted and which has only been
mentioned incidentally heretofore. '.
Chief Justice H. C. Ide of the island has i
a very pretty daughter of 18. She was j
born ift a leap year on February 29, and
consequently could only enjoy the luxury i
of a birthday every fourth year. While â¢
she was away visiting friends in .Vermont
she wrote to her father expressing regret j
about this.
The Judge mentioned the matter jok
ingly to Stevenson, who thereupon
straightway sat down and made a will, be
queathing his own birthday to the discon
solate young lady. f./v
The will was lengthy and elaborate,
using all the legal phraseology, as Steven
son said, "that he could think of," and
giving as his reason for the bequest that
he was growing old and had little use of a
birthday now, anyhow, and he would be
pleased if it would be made to do his
young friend any good.
She wrote to him thanking him cor
dially, and has since religiously celebrated
the poet's birthday, which, by the way,
was one of the conditions of the bequest
that she should do.

force yesterday and the courts were
crowded. The principal attraction was at
the San Francisco court, where J. Harlow,
the coast' champion, and T. I< . Bonnet
played against J. Riordan and M.. J. Kil-
Millon the Denver champion. Every seat
in the gallery was occupied, and many who
were unable to get a seat climbed to the
roof The game was one of the best seen
on the coast. Harlow ana Bonnet started
off in great style and won the first two
games with ease, Harlow tossing twenty
eight consecutive aces. They seemed to
take things easy in the third game, which
was won by Kilgallon and Riordan, and
the latter astonished everybody by winning
the next two games, although the final was
won by only two ace.?. In the two last
games there was as fine an exhibition of
science on both sides as could be seen any
where.

SEVERAL GOOD SCORES MADE.!
Schuetzen and Shell Mound Shooting I
Ranges Were Well
Patronized.
i
a<* th Â« sharpshooters the choosing of i
their day, so far as its being favorable for |
shooting goes, they could not have selected '
a more favorable one than was yesterday
for shooting at the target.
And yesterday, being one of the very
finest of California winter days, many
marksmen shouldered their rifles and hied
themselves in divisions to Schuetzen arid
Shell Mound parks, there to spend the day,
accompanied by their wives and children, !
to enjoy themselves in their accustomed ;
way, without interfering with their neigh- '
bors' joys or comforts.
The more pronounced marksmen of the
several vereins, headed by trie renowned
target-piercer Philo Jacoby, patronized
Schuetzen Park, there to compete for hon- >
ore and medals. -v.t- - -
The competition between the mem
bers of the California Schuetzen Club
who belong to the National Guard and
who will report in Sacramento on Wash- I
ington's birthday, there to compete with I
the gold- bar winners from the entire State !
for possession of the State's medal, re- I
sulted in the selection of: A. Enrenpfort, |
P. Kelly. H. R. Brown, T. J. Carroll, F.
C. Muller, F. Riehl and Charles Novak. :
Yesterday's shooting at Schuetzen Park j
was opened by the Grutli Verein section |
forthe monthly medal. The contest was
sharp and animated, and after all the '
scores had been carefully totaled up it re- j
suited in the following numerical order: j
W. D\ethelm, J. Boehman. H. Hinter- i
mann, F. Baumgarten, Charles Ott, M. A. j
Tschurr and John Frei.
The Turner Schuetzens proceeded next j
to earn honors at what is Known as plain i
bullseye shooting. The scores made in j
this contest were very fine, and resulted in I
the following order: O. Burmiester, F. j
Brunotte, C. Sageborn, H. Enger, Charles â¢ !
Neilson, Charles Rudolph, Joseph Straub,
W. F. Attinger. H. Steiber, L. Bruni, F.
Kommer and W. Glinderraann.
The members of this club, immediately
on the finish of the above score, com
peted for the medal of the championship
class. W. Glimiermann was more for- !
tunate in this score, as he came out with
flying banners, carrying with him T the
championship medal. J. Straub came
next on the role of honorable mention,
and obtained the first-class medal. L.
Bruni won the second-class medal. R.
Finking came next with the first best shot
outside of the medal ring, and F. Attinger
followed close in his tracks and was cred
ited with the last best shot.
The final bout of the day was the most
exciting, as it was for the yearly diamond
medal, which, when won, will become the
property of the lucky man who makes the
best 7 shots out of 12 at the end of the j
year. -
The shooting for this valuable prize yes
terday was far above the average of other !
competitions, as the figures will show.
The shooting for this prize is at a six-inch
pasteboard target, 200 feet distant, and the
exact measurement being so precise as to
measure one inch by the thousandth part, j

of to cause the marksmen to shift their
wmdgauges, but the light was treacherous.
none better than riflemen realize the tricks
tne light on an ordinary bright day can play,
it frequently happens that within the space
Â°\. second the atmospheric : conditions
will chance so as to completely upset a
mans . calculations. -~ For example, the
black disk in the white target on a 200-yard
range will appear riot over 100 yards away
and the next minute it will be so dim as
to appear 250 or 300 yards away.
. Such illusions are bad enough, but the
refleman is completely at sea . hen the
bullseye - "stretches" down to meet the
front sight on his rifle. That, is the round
black . disk appears to become elongated
like an egc on end. When this illusion
takes place the marksman had better wait
for the atmosphere to clear or he will be
.taking great chances of making, a wild
shot. â  v
' Another atmospheric caprice is when
the heat and light give the lower part of
the round disk a flattened appearance like
the bottom of a pear. To fully explain the
causes of these eccentricities would take
too much space, but briefly stated they are
heat, light and wind.
Such conditions existed yesterday, and
it kept the marksmen thinking rapidly to
keep pace with the changes. For all . that
a number of very good scores were made.
The shooting section of the Red Men
held its regular contest for class medals.
The scores and winners were as follows:
Champion medal, won by John Zimmermann,
! 369 rings; first class medal, won by H. Bach.
| 332; second class medal, won by P. H. Hulffs,
I 296; third class medal, won by W. Dressier,
' 260; fourth class medal, won by G. Wagner,
j 200; first best-shot medal, won by G. Huer,
24 ; last best-shot medal, won by H. Bockmanu,
25. . - , Â»
Several of tbe military sharpshooters
held their monthly medal shoots/ Since
the reorganization of the National Guard
many new nun have entered the volun
teer service and nearly all are young men.
All of the latter have entered rifle shoot
ing with enthusiasm, and, while their
scores are not very high, they are deter
mined to succeed. Many of the new mem
bers were on the range practicing yester
day. , Following are the companies, marks

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1896.
MARDI GRAS PREPARATION
Artists Produce ' Wonderful
Changes at the Hopkins .
Mansion.
STANTON IS CHIEF MAGICIAN.
Artistic and Bizarre Decorative Ef
fects to Astonish and Delight : J.
â¢ the Maskers. V
Had Artist John Stanton lived the
time of Aladdin that lucKy young magician
would not have needed his lamp to secure
beautiful interior deooratioris for his pal
ace. :He might have turned Stanton loose
in a room with a miscellaneous assortment
of tacks, wire mesh fencing material, old
clothes and a tub of water thickened with
plaster of pans, and, 10, bare walls would,
be transfigured into immense, elaborately
carved panels. Some soft colored paint
and a lot of gilt powder, and , gorgeous
trappings would result.
That is what was being done at the Hop
kins Art â  Institute all day yesterday. A
piece of wire netting was bent and tacked
on the wall. A piece of cloth wet in plas-
ter of paris is fastened over it. There is a
smearing of gold paint, -andâ prestoâ a
massive gilt vase of classic form, daintily
poised, stands out from the wall in strong
relief. â¢ ' â¢ . . -W/ : ' : &
The scene at the institute was a stirring
one. Stanton and a half dozen art stu
donts dressed in dirty loose blouses and
old clothes. were transforming the recep
tion hall into a room of wonderful artistic
beauty and novelty. Queer effects in
lighting and original and bizarre decora
tive ideas have been given full sway, so
that the rooms for the Mardi Gras will
present an artistic appearance.
. There were rive young men with tangled
locks and bronze bedaubed faces assisting
Mr. Stanton. They were William Huba
cek, Ralph Robinson, Charley Burnett,
Mr. Aitken and It. Urunuela. All are art
students. â¢ ' \
One of the most striking features of the
decoration are the hangings of glorious
oriental rugs. This work was being super
intended â¢ personally by Hadji- Ephraim
Bcnguiat, who also furnished the rugs,
most of which are of rare historical inter
est. Mr. Bemiuiat is well known among
the artists for his striking work, and five
years ago did the decorating of the rooms
for the great artists' ball in Boston.
There, are to. he many distinguished
guests at the ball. His Higness the Duke
of Abruzzi, A. Bertolini, commander of
the Christoforo Colombo, and. officers, and
General Forsyth and his staff are to be
present in full uniform, Paderewski will
also attend. Besides this there have been
answers to the invitations from over two
hundred and fifty of society's 400. -
. Sir Henry Heyman, who is to lead the
orchestra, promises that the maskers will
have music such as they never danced to
before. Mr. Martin merely beams and
says: ''It will be beyond every one's ex
pectations." " '-,"'â¢;*-/
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Boatman Henry Peterson and
His Faithful Little Ger-
man Band.
Trial Trip of the Steamer AdamsâAr
... rival of Three Deep- Water
Ships.
The bright, sunny day and warm, pleas
ant weather drew many people down on
the ; water . front yesterday,, and conse
quently the wharves were crowded with
visitors.
.The sociable and courteous; officers- of
the Italian cruiser Cristoforo Colombo
again invited the public to inspect their
vessel, and several tugs gayly flying the
tri-coior of Italy carried passengers be
tween the ship and the shore. Henry Pe
terson, with his launch Amy, by a bright
stroke of policy, provided music for the
patron's of his craft, and caught the greater
part of the passengers who went out to
the Colombo. His landing-place was
alongside of the German ship H. Hack
feld, and noticine an accordion lying on
the vessel's topgallant forecastle he made
inquiries and learned that the whole ship's'
crew were masters of melody. ,
So he employed: the entire outfit to sit
on the Hackfeld's ; rail :' several hours for a
keg of beer. ;l The band consisted of the
acordion ; as ' leader, * a violin, two Â»' very
home-made drums vividly # hand-painted,
â  a triangle, tambourine and pair of cimbals.
The music was ; not quite Paderewskian,
but the artists stuck faithfully to Peterson
and filled the 'little Amy. till her gunwales
were level with. the water.;. A" rival >. boat
man, whose passenger business to the
cruiser was *in j'jred *: thereby, is ' going to'
bring, the matter before ; the ' Musicians'
Union and have the Amy boycotted for
running to the time of "scab" music. ; ; ;"
,: ' The ' United ; States - steamer Adams re
turned from her trial trip of /Â»' short run
down the Coast yesterday. It was her
first work outside since being extensively
repaired and refitted; at Mare Island.: She
attained a speed of- 10.9 knots in a mod-;
crate sea with her engines working splen
didly, and .the inspecting officers, are
highly pleased with. the vessel's j behavior.
She will leave for Honolulu to-morrow or
next day. '." ''â¢
The revenue cutter 'Perry, which is un
dergoing extensive repairs at Main-street
dock, will, when ready for sea, have had
$10,000 spent on her. She will be provided
with a fine new battery of six-pounder

which are to secure for the people popular,
control of the ' Government and of public
industries, public ownership of all lands
and of all railroads. ; The circular in one
clause sets forth:' -â¢ .â â --
The all-including and incomparably dynamic
idea of society, as it closes this century, is co
operation under general or public ownership, in
which the people replace the capitalists and the
political state is advanced into an industrial
organization. Co-operation we must- have;
but we cannot have it without: public owner
ship. The one sound and abiding foundation
union is theiefore, this principle of public
ownership, glt is : the one potent and pre-'
hensive combining thought. > â¢
Membership in the order proposed for bind
ing all progressives into a conscious working
organism consists simply in a pledge to pro
mote public ownership in every possible way.
Whenever a member can do so, 'he will explain
the bearings of nationalizing this or that in
dustry, the; railroads, the trust, the land; he
will vote for the same, making it his ever pres
ent political motive; he vill plan how to com-,
pel political bodies, to, adopt it, and how to re
place the present order of barren politicians
by men sworn to the reorganization of 'society
by making industries public property; he will
pledge his neighbors and friends to muster and
combine their energies for this, urgent social
reformation. ; ; '";.~. '' .'--â¢â â¢ '-'â¢?"â  --â >-. .- ,;â r.

ARMY AND NAVY NOTES.
Forest Area of the Presidio
Reservation Con
sidered.
LIEUT. SCHOFIELD'S HEARING.
Freaks of an Old Napoleon Gunâ The
Commander of the Monad
nock.
Captain Reid, a retired officer of the U.
S. Navy, in ; accordance with custom, is
permitted to use a gun belonging to the
Government to make experiments in ord
nance. The captain as a representative of
a private company is now endeavoring to
give to a projectile fired from a smooth-bore
gun the rotary motion which rifled grooves
impart. This is accomplished some way
by indenting the projectiles.
It appears that Captain Reid's experi
ments are not only, interesting to himself
and the company which he represents, but
they afford also a variety of entertainment
to soldiers and spectators. It has been his
privilege to use a 12-pound Napoleon
which has long occupied an ornamental
position near the* Presidio flagstaff. .On
the first occasion that Captain Reid used
the gun. the projectile which was.calcu
late d, according to the army regulations
and the logic of the ordnunce officers, to
lo.dro in a sand bank, after it had passed
through two wire nettings erected to test
velocity, did ricochet from the soft sand
bank/made a graceful flight over a brush
crowned hill, descend. into the National
Cemetery and knock over a headstone.
Thereupon General .Graham directed
that future experiments should be made
on the water front of the Presidio, and
knowing the gun, cautioned the gunners
against shooting while any. floating craft
in the bay was in the line of fire or any
way near it.
' Everything being arranged the old Na
poleon was taken down to the beach and
the muzzle pointed toward Marin County.
At the first lire the projectile went all
right, but the. Napoleonic exhibition was I
made in the rear. The gun kicked, broke
the troul, dismounted in the sand. Inquiry
disclosed. the fact that the ordinary charge
of two pounds and a ball of powder was
used, but that Captain field's new-fangled
projectile weighed forty pounds, whereas j
the ordinary prejectile weighs only twelve !
pounds. The company which. Captain ',
Reid . represents must repair the damage
before further experiments can be made. j
The board of army officers, which was
recently appointed by General Forsyth to 1
examine the forest area of the Presidio '
reservation,' with a view of ascertaining ;
whether there should be extension, of the
forests, has forwarded a report to Washing
ton. The chairman of the board is Colo
nel S. B. M. Young, Fourth Cavalry. It
is believed that "the recommendation of
the board is to the effect that the forest
area is already i large enough. The Pre
sidio reservation embraces 1300 acres of
land, and much of ; that, space is already
covered with young trees. In some places
the growth is so dense that one can hardy
walk through the woods. Space" must be
kept open : on the V reservation for field
maneuvering of the troops and if the War
Department policy of concentration is
fully developed the force of soldiers at
the Presidio will be largely increased.
The nomination of ; Colonel: J.* J. Cop
pinger to be; brigadier-general, which was
suspended for so long a time in the Sen
ate, was finally confirmed a few days since.
Senators Burrows, Gear, -Perkins,' Teller,
Pot'tigrew, . Squire : and - Wilson made
speeches in opposition to the nomination,
urging principally the delay.of the general
in becoming a citizen of the United States
and; criticising : the - President .- in * passing
over so many, senior 'officers ,in selecting
him. ; The vote of confirmation was . de
cisive, as 44; Senators voted affirmatively
and only 17 in the negative-
Lieutenant r R.'McA;\ Schofield of the
Fourth Cavalry recently appeared "before
the examining board at the 'Presidio for
promotion. The board found in. the course
of the physical examination of the candi
date that'll is hearing was defective. Then
.came the question ; whether the deafness
was sufficient ; to unfit him for duty ; ; also
as to when and how it occurred; ! Lieuten
ant Schofield was j duly examined j and
found qualified ; by a \ board ?of army \ stir-'
geons in 1889."; It appears, however, that
certain V officers who knew Mr. Schofield
before â¢he" en red \ the : army -j are -of j the
opinion that â he -was ? then deaf. ] A ques
tion arises here which the board will have
to settle. If Lieutenant field's, dis
ability originated â¢in the ; line of duty he
would under the law be entitled to be re
tired.with the rank of first lieutenant. If,
however, it is decided j that he was deaf at
the time he was passed by the first board
a complication will arise which may not
only affect the military status of Lieuten- :
ant Schofield, but the officers on his first
board. The question of fact will have to
be determined by the present examining
board. ' .- .'... ~'\ 'â¢'.;â .".:>:'}-â â â

on a Crozier-Buffington disappearing

a defect of the counterpoise in the well.

Two Riders Meet With Serious
Accidents Near the
Ingleside.
The Victims Are Dr. J. T. Rowand,
Dentist, and Mrs. Sarah Bowman,
> Dressmaker.
_______
The Ingleside was the scene of two bi
cycle accidents yesterday, one of the in
jured being a lady and the other a mem
ber of the sterner sex.
Dr. J. T. Rowand, dentist, was riding
with a friend, and when opposite the dairy
farm near the House of Correction, his bi
cycle struck against an obstruction in the
road and he fell heavily to the ground.
He struck on his face and right side, and
when his friend jumped off his machine
and ran to him he was unconscious.
Blood was pouring from a wound over the
right eye and another on his nose.
â¢ Help was procured, and the unconscious
dentist was carried into the residence on
the dairy farm and the ambulance was
summoned. Dr. Rinne accompanied the
ambulance and dressed the wounds. He
was under the impression that the skull
might have been fractured. There was a
large lump on .the forehead just over the
right eye. j Dr. Breyfogle; the family phy
sician, was also summoned and he : took
charge of the case. it was thought ad
visable to keep the patient at the dairy i
farm until he recovered from the shoe* to '
his system. â¢
While the ambulance was \ there Dr.
Rinne was notified that a lady had fallen
from her bicycle a little further east, and
it was driven there. The lady was Mrs.
Sarah Bowman, a dressmaker, living at
324 Brannan street. ' She and a party of
friends started out to ride through the
Ingleside to the ocean beach. Her bicycle
got stuck suddenly in some wet sand and
she was thrown off. She fell on her left
siae, and the shock made her unconscious
for a few moments.
She was taken in the ambulance to the I
Receiving Hospital, where Drs. Weil, Fitz
gibbon and Bunnell attended to her. She
was unable to lift her left leg, and the
doctors were ; afraid that one of the bones
bad been . misplaced. Her left shoulder
and elbow were also badly contused. She
was detained in the hospital until another
examination can be made after the swelling
was reduced. She declared that she would
never ride a bicycle again. r
-V' ' The Old Quincy Mansion.
The Adams family has decided to pre
' sent to the Quincy Historical Society the
house in Quincy, Mass., in which; Presi
dent John Quincy Adams was born, to be
. occupied by it as a museum. "The house,"
j says the Boston Transcript, "is situated at
the corner r of â¢ Independence avenue and
Franklin street, and is in a good state of
preservation; ' With a little alteration it
can be converted into a fine example of a
mansion of the Colonial style. This will
be done, and the ; ; furnishings \ , made to
correspond with those of the dwellings of
the Revolutionary â¢ period. The Quincy
family is, by inheritance, the possessor of
much that is of great . historic value, con
necting that family by the closest of ties
and associations with the history of the
Nation from its inception, to the present
time,* and there is ;a - hope that a part, at
least, of 'this rare â¢ collection, ; important
from a National as well as a local point of
view, may in time find \ a permanent rest
ing-place in what was at r one time the
home of two of the early Presidents of the
United States and the birthplace of one of
them." .: ' " .

TN THE SAN BENITO VALLEY THERE 18
â¢*- a most picturesque little place which is cel-
ebrated for the excellence of its crops and the
sturdy, character of its native sons. One of
the good lamilies of the place is that of the
Ashursts, the boys being well known for their
straightforwardness and manly bearing. In-
deed, in that region there is no one more re-
spected. Some little while atro, however, one
of them (Robert) began to appreciate that all
was not well with him. He did not pay muca
attention to the growing weakness that he felt,
thinking that it was only a passing ailment.
But here was where he made a serious blunder.
As his disease progressed he began to realise
that he. was indeed ill. He tried all that he
could do to shake off the. attack, using all the
remedies that he knew of for that purpose,
but still it kept getting more and more firmly
implanted In his system. Almost on the verge
of giving up, he wrote to the Hudson Medical'
instituteâ great institution for the cure
of the sickâ he at once got a letter telling
him that he need not despair. And now, aftei
having been under the skill of the specialists
.here for a couple of weeksâ just fancy it, only
a fortnightâ he has been done so much good
that he frankly says that he would not be .
where he was just those few days ago for five
hundred dollars. Here is a letter that he has
seen tit to write -to the management of the
great institute:
Panoche, Cal., August 13, 1893.
Hudson Medical Institute, San Francisco,
Cal.â Gentlemen : I reply fn pursuance to your
requests. I have been taking your medicines
.or about two weeks and am greatly pleased
with the results. . Am no longer trouoled with
headache, backache or. deep, pains. My eye-
sight is very much better, blood docs not rush
to my head as it used to, and as a consequence
ay intellect is brighter and brain clearer.
Have gaiued six pounds' since commencing
treatment. My bowels do not yet move as reg-
ularly as they should, but I take a tablet every
night, ami that may be all. right- in time. I
realize that it takes time to effect a cure. Hon-
estly, gentlemen, I would not take $500 to re-
lapse into the state I was in before I applied to
you. I remain yours respectfully,
.:;. , Robeut ashurst Ja.
Now, that is. the letter of a highly respected
and intelligent young man, and it shows most
â¢conclusively how remarkably efficient and
rapid In its work the treatment of the special-
ists of the "greatest of all curative establish-
ments on this continent" is. But Mr. Ashurst
is by no means alone in his high opinion of
what -is being regularly done for suffering hu-
manity there.
Mr. E. W. Fowler of Kamela. Or., writes: "I
am feeling so good now that if I felt any better
I could jump out of my skin." â¢
S.J. Bailey of Weavervllle, Cal. : "After tw*
months' treatment with you. I feel fully re-
stored to health."
George H. Rice of Fort Canby, Wash., says:
"The treatment of the Hudson Medical Insti-
tute is all that could be expected or desired by
any one."
Hundreds of letters of this sort come to the
management, cheering them on to further ef-
fort to make the statement more than ever
true that "AS LONG AS THERE IS LIFE
THERE IS HOPE IF THE SPECIALISTS OF
THE GRAND OLD HUDSON MEDICAL INSTI-

A WRONG IMPRESSION.
j The Argonaut, ordinarily so shrewd and
1 careful, has evidently fallen into a mis
conception of The Call's position on the
! railroad | funding proposition. It says:
j " The Call says that the Vanderbilt and
I Gould interests intend to buy the Pacific
' railways at foreclosure sale; that the Van
| derbilt "and Gould set will oppose refund-
I ing; that if the transcontinental railroads
pass into their hands it would insure
genuine competition with the .Southern
Pacific; that therefore The Callâ we
understand itâ is opposed to Government
ownership, in order, to bring about this
sale to the Gould and Vanderbilt interests."
The Call had tried so earnestly to make
its position unmistakable that it confesses
to surprise over this misconception. It
trusts that the following statement cannot
be misunderstood :
The Call has never discussed the ques
tion of Government ownership on its
' merits, nor the question of. Government
operation, because neither of those ques
tions has yet properly arisen. It has
deemed such discussions irrelevant, or at
most merely incidental, to the question of
collecting the Government debt owing by
the aided roads, its belief being that such
collection would inevitably break the
Southern Pacific's monopoly by one means
or another. Several contingencies will
ensue upon the foreclosure of the Govern
ment's mortgage, among them possibly
Government ownership and remotely Gov
ernment operationâ two quite distinct
propositions. It believes that to spring, at
this time, the question of Government
ownership, much less that of Government
operation, would be ill-advised, as likely
to rouse in the East, which is ruled by a
spirit more conservative than ours, an an
tagonism which will defeat foreclosure,
pass the funding bill and fasten the pres
ent monopoly irrevocably upon our prog
ress.
In Congressman. Maguire's published
information that the Gould and Vander
bilt interests would likely be glad to buy
the Union and Central Pacific roads at
foreclosure sale The Call saw a probable
purchaser who not only would secure the
interests of the Government with regard
to its lien, but who would be clearly and
necessarily a genuine competitor of the
Southern Pacific. Besides accomplishing j
both those desired ends such a purchase at
foreclosure sale, would hold the questions
of Government ownership and operation
in abeyance, thus withdrawing a challenge
to Eastern conservatism and making
possible the defeat of a funding-scheme.
Hence it is evident that the Argonaut errs
in assuming that The Call "is opposed to
Government ownership in order to bring
about this sale to the Gould and Vander
bilt interests." The Call, on its own ac
count, knows nothing about the desires or
intentions of the Gould and Vanderbilt in- j
terests. It is merely, taking Congressman ;
Maguire's word for that, and it considers j
the Gould and Vanderbilt interests merely j
as the only solution of all the difficulties
that has been presented. The Gould and ;
Vanderbilt interests 'are no more to The
Call than any other Interests that might
fit the situation as well. If this statement
of The Call's position is not perfectly
clear it will cheerfully use every endeavor
to make it so. Tne Argonaut's evident ]
admiration of The Call makes it a pleas
ure to state the matter thus fully, in order
that its position may not be misunder-. !
stood, at least by its friends.
A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
The San Francisco .Bulletin has recently |
published a series of instructive articles
concerning the terrible fate of some Amer
ican and English seamen and seal-fishers
caught poaching on Robben Island, a Rus
sian possession, and sentenced to serve
the full penalty of the Russian law, seven
teen years in a . Siberian prison. Our con
temporary asserts that the news of the
matter was brought hither by the British
schooner pan, that the high State au
thorities of California declined to appeal to
the National Government for an investiga
tion, and that in the absence of that assist
ance a petition for an inquiry has been
forwarded to Washington by several sea
captains of this port, and the friends and
relatives of Edward Howe, a native Cali
fornian, who is named as one of the vic
tims of Russia's terrible discipline. .
Assuming these facts to be- true, and .
basing that assumption on the Bulletin's.
reputation for care, we are confronted
with a case of uncommon gravity. Ap
parently Russia has acted strictly within
its laws. It found men unlawfully taking
seals within its waters, and without con
cerning itself with international questions
or the policy pursued by the United States
and England in similar cases, it applied
its law and imposed upon the offenders
the fullest penalty. This punishment is
infinitely severer than that which the
United States and England would impose.
It is equivalent to death. :-*::'
It is well for cases like this to arise, for
they serve to measure degrees of civiliza
tion and to modify the savagery of nations
which have only begun to lift their heads
above the horizon of barbarity. The
United States and England cannot afford
to permit any country under, the sun to
inflict upon the people who claim their
protection a severer penalty for the infrac
tion of ordinary rights than they them
selves impose. To do otherwise would be
to encourage barbarism and reduce the
potency of a civilized protection. ; ! >:
The case will appear clearer upon taking
into account the fact that three nations
the United States, England and Russia
have interests in the seal fisheries, and
that England and the United States each
turn over to the other by agreement, under
theguaid of just laws in common and a
mutual system of surveillance, their re
spective subjects or citizens who have vio
lated the law. Under that system poach
ing is treated fairly as an act of common
theft, and the offender is punished in ac
cordance with his deserts. But neither of
these countries 'imposes a sentence of any
thing like imprisonment in a Siberian
prison for seventeen years, in comparison
with which hanging would be merciful;
If the combined power of the United
States and England is not sufficient to
bring Russia, by peaceful means, under
the operation of civilized laws in the mat
ter of common theft, where the lives and
liberty of I Americans and Englishmen are
imperiled, it would be better to abandon
Bering Sea to the great White Czar and
permit him to cut the throat of every fish
erman or navigator who â¢ comes i within
sight of ; the Aleutian Islands. The peti
tion which has been * forwarded to Wash
ington from California may be humble, but
it cries aloud .: for common ' justice and the
progress of the world. . T â¢"''â¢'. ;
' A SECTIONAL SPIRIT.
An analysis of the vote â¢ by j which 'the
electors of Berkeley defeated the proposi
tion to issue bonds for a wharf and school
houses develops a curious condition of af
fairsâ that, operating in a wider scope
in California, has done so much to retard
the progress of the . State. ' I The i people in
the vicinity of the proposed- wharf toted
generously for '. the 4 wharf \ bonds and took
little interest in the sch.oolhouses, as they
were needed in a : different part of town.
Conversely, the people in the districts
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1896.
needing â  the schoolhouses voted "for I the
school * bonds and ; neglected â ',' the wharf.
As a result the total vote was very light
and the necessary two-thirds were not se
cured. That is, Berkeley cannot enjoy the
increase in business, population and prop
erty values which the construction of a
wharf would _ have secured, and - the
authorities are unable to accommodate all
the children who want to attend the pub
lic schools. The parents of these must
move away in order to find schools. : ; â¢ ;
It seems not to have occurred to the
great body of the people that the entire
community would have received a benefit
from either of tne two proposed improve
ments. Identical in character with this
attitude is that strong : sectional spirit
which has existed in different major parts
of California. ;It is true that this is break
ing down and that a broader wisdom . and
a genuine State pride are steadily growing,
due largely to the efforts of the State Im
provement Committee; but now and then
it has a sporadic outbreak, principally in
newspapers, and it takes the old deplor
able form of making disparaging compari
sons between different parts of the State.
Until this is wholly abandoned we cannot
hope for all" the good things to which our
wealth of natural resources entitles us.
The whole truth is this: No two of the
larger sections of the State are alike, but
all that are habitable are good in their sev
eral ways. One has excellences and draw
backs - which are foreign to another. ' No
comparison of any two in any one particu
lar is fair, but on the contrary is damag
ing, for the reason that it excludes the
vital broad issues involved. A section
that. might seem superior to one person
might not to another. An industry that
might flourish better in one section than
another would not concern a person who
desires to engage in some other industry.
It is this wonderful variety of California
that constitutes its greatest charm and
value. It is a "house of many mansions,"
in which every pursuit can be followed and
every member of civilized humanity find a
congenial home and occupation. Until
we ourselves show by an abolition of the
sectional spirit that we appreciate the
marvelous breadth and variety of our re
sources it is folly to expect tnat we shall
be able to convince strangers of the fact. .
Sectional pride is another matter. It is
right that a resident of one part of the
State should proclaim the attractions
which have contributed to his health,
wealth and happiness; but if in doing so
he decries other sections he is proclaimine
himself an enemy of the State and a
worker of barm to bis immediate neigh
bors. S\j
The Berkeley incident betrays another
unfortunate condition lack of a unified
and earnest spirit of progress. That is the
case in other places as well, and it dis
closes a lack of homogeneity. This is an
obstacle to be studied and overcome.
COAST EXCHANGES.
Santa Clara County is having an ex
traordinary boom in railroad-building.
Mention has been made in these columns
i of the steam road which is to connect San
I Jose with the Bay of San Francisco and of
1 the electric road between San Jose and
Saratoga. The San Jose News now comes
! out with the information that John Center,
'â â  a San Francisco capitalist, backer of R. H.
: Quincy, who owned a controlling interest
: in the road connecting San Jose and Alum
j Rock, has been compelled to take the
property and is determined to put it on a
first-class footing. The road has barely
J paid interest, but if properly developed
| ought to be made a valuable enterprise.
Our contemporary, quoting a well-in
: formed citizen, say 3 this of Mr. Center's
! intentions: "I understand he will. build it
i upâ put on new rolling-stock, equip it
' completely, furnish electricity as a motive
! power, if necessary, and operate it by the
overhead system." The News adds that as
'< Mr. Center is not a railroad man he will
j put the property on the market as soon as
j he has completely equipped and estab
i lished it. This is an important line, as it
: connects San Jose with its beautiful park ,
and hot springs in the; mountains seven
! miles to the eastward, and passes through
a charming section of the valley. 'â !* '"â¢;.
While all- these things are going forward
the Newman (Stanislaus County) Tribune
is urging that the residents of that county
extend the Mount Hamilton wagon road
I over the mountains into the San Joaquin
j Valley. This is an old project, but it has
| been almost forgotten for years. "Santa
Clara County," says the Tribune, "has
already built to the county line, and on
our side the road runs several miles up the
; Orestimba creek, leaving a gap of only
! about twenty miles to build. Little trouble
would be experienced in the matter of
right-of-way, for when the matter was
talked of a couple of years ago some of the
I settlers offered to not only give the right,
| of- way, but would build the road through
i their own land, so anxious were they to
| get communication with the towns."" As
1 stated by the Tribune, the two great points
j of interest in the State are the Yosemite
j Valley and , the Lick Observatory, and as
I the Santa Clara end of the road now runs
I by the Lick Observatory, but a short time
j would elapse before stages would be run
ning from San Jose to the Yosemite Valley
j via the observatory. The Mount Hamil
! ton road, twenty-six miles â  long, was built
! by Santa Clara County at a cost of $83,000.
j It is admittedly the finest mountain road
jin this part of California. Its extension
j over the range into the San Joaquin would
make it one of the grandest and most use
j ful scenic roads in the country. -
The petroleum industry of the State is
staggering ahead op untried legs. The
price at the Los Angeles wells has. been
advanced to 50 cents a barrel, and the Los
Angeles Journal makes this important an
nouncement: â¢ "It is . believed that the
Standard Oil Company will be in the field
within a few days as a purchaser of the en
tire surplus at as good figures as 50 cents
per barrel in well tanks. That company
is expending between $25,000 and $30,000
for tanks and other equipments."
It adds: "Putting fragments of infor
mation into intelligible form, it seems not
improbable that oil may advance to 60 or
70 cents per: barrel within a few weeks.
The Standard Oil Company ' bases prices
upon units of heat, and it is well known
that oil of far superior gravity is obtained
from the lower sands, but it takes money
to drill down ano/the business is rapidly
getting into 'â¢ the hands of conservative
business . . men. During the last $ three
months eighty-six wells have fallen -off
one-third ,in product; there is an abun
dance of oil in the lower strata, but prices
must - materially advance before more
money will be expended in development."
.The Whittier oil industry is advancing
satisfactorily. Of :it . the Journal: says:
"The new refinery at Chinois only twelve
or fifteen miles distant; and the Whittier
product being ; of /very lieht ' gravity < the
refinery will ' make 'an important market
for all the petroleum that can be produced.
It is reDorted that sevnral drilling rigs
may be taken from the * Los Angeles field
for development work 'â  in that promising
territory. The highest gravity reached is
above 30 per cent ; ' the Los Angeles â  field
runs from 12 "to 18 per cent in first sand.
There is a strong market for â¢ lubricating
oils, and the product of the Southern Cali
fornia fields is sard to be a very superior
article." 'â¢ ."':";â¢ ''.".' '..". 'â  "â  "â â ''.'â '
On the subject of petroleum for fuel the-
Stockton Record furnishes the following
interesting particulars: "The question of
burning petroleum on the river boats has
been referred to the Government authori
ties. Some time ago the United States offi
cials compelled the Southern Pacific to
stop burning crude oil both on their ferry
boats between San Francisco and Oakland
and also on the big Solano plying between
Port Costa and Benicia. V No accidents had
occurred and the railroad company be
lieved their apparatus was perfectly safe,
but the Government would not issue them
a license to carry passengers on the boats
so long as crude oil was burned, the under
stood objection being the storing of the in
flammable fluid on board the boats and
consequently danger of explosions. Engi
neers deny that with the modern appli
ances any danger is attached to the carry
ing or burning of crude oil on passenger
boats, ' and it is believed that the law is
now such as will allow the river boats to
use it. If such is the case, and the test at
the Union mills prove successful, it is
likely the boats will be transformed into
oil burners at once." 'Â'-â¢'-'â - 'â -...

says: "The prospects are good, and Mr.
Weilheimer is . of the opinion that a good
vein will soon be developed, and conse
quently has men employed doing the
necessary work preparatory to substantial
prospecting and development. The vein
is . located where access is easy, where
water in plentiful and natural facilities
good. The indications are that a bounti
ful supply of coal will be found, which
will prove a valuable accession to the re
sources of Santa Clara County.!' It is
proper to add that the Santa Cruz Moun
tains, abound in lignite and that the geo
graphical character of the range does not
encourage the hope that true coal will be
encountered. However, as California is a
State of surprises and wonders, and as Mr.
Weilheimer is an intelligent and success

A HORSE WITH A MUSTACHE.
f ; There is a horse with & mustache in town,
says the New York Journal. This oddity's
name is "Duke" and he is the star boarder at
the livery stable of L. F. Lockridge, an under
taker of 310 East Twenty-sixth street.
"Duke's" mustache is a bona-fide affair of
the most approved Human type. It Is long and
curly, like Mayor Patrick Gleason's of Long
Island City, and anybody would be proud of It.
"Duke" is heavy, thick-set, black, 15 hands
high, and his ancestors came' from Normandy.
Nobody seems to know where "Dune" came

"Duke" and His Mustache.
from, except that he was bought in a horse
market in i West Twenty-fifth street and that
his pedigree .Is problematical. According to
experts who have carefully examined his teeth
he is 8 years old and remarkably well devel
oped for his age.
"Duke's" chief business is to take part in
funerals. Occasionally he attends a wedding.
At funerals (the mustache has been known to
occasion much embarrassment to the mourn- '
ers. Recently a widow was shocked at the hi- '
larity ot a group which she thought was di
rected at herself, instead of at the animal
which was helping to draw her carriage. That
evening Duke had his upper lip shaved, but
the mustache would not down. It burst forth
the next morning and began to mature quicker
and more profusely â  than any - human mus
tache. It grew until Jim McMahon, stable
man and driver for Undertaker Lockridge, re
ceived orders to use the- shears.
To .his other accomplishments McMahon
now adds that of equine barber. Every
morning he combs and cuts "Duke's" glossy
black mane, but his real genius he reserves for
"Duke's" mustache, which he trims regularly
and often, giving each end a jaunty upward
turn for weddings and a melancholy downward
droop for . funerals. As a matter ; of fact,
"Duke" is made to wear his mustache in . vari
ous styles. The other day when he appeared
with it waxed at the ends, a la Colonel War
ing, he created quite a furor on the East Side,
street-cleaners standing to attention and giv
ing the military salute. '.

White Hat McCarty, believes in caricature.
He considers it the highest form of portraiture
and' occasionally takes a hand In it himself.
â¢ One afternoon while talking with some gen
tlemen at the Palace Hotel his eyes fell upon
three of his countrymen who had j just arrived
from the other side.
â¢ "By jove," he exclaimed; "give me a pencil
and paper somebody, while I caricature those
fellows." . '"â¢;:' â¢
The material called ' for was supplied him

The Rev. Mardon D. "Wilson is an inter
esting man. He is gentle and affable and
is most zealous in his work of winning
souls over to God. He speaks with force
and eloquence from the pulpit. During
the few months he has been rector of St. Pe
ter's he has met with gratifying success.
He was appointed to this charge on Octo
ber ,1, 1895. Previous to that time he was
rector of St. Andrew's Church, Oakland. .
On coming to this coast from . college in
New Haven some. ten years ago he located
at Astoria, Or., where he remained four
years. He. next went to Vancouver, where
he presided over an 1 Episcopalian church
for six years. I Then he came to California.
The rector's sermon at the morning
service yesterday was in relation to the
approaching season of Lent. He dwelt
with great clearness and. force upon the
efficacy of prayer and the glories of the
pure and sinless life. His text was from
St. John, xvi:l2: "I have many things to
say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
now." He developed the idea that God
only reveals truth by degrees or stages, as
men . are able to receive it. This was
clearly taught in the New Testament and
agrees in every way with the experiences
of life. "> v V ;;r " ; '-_:
He declared that revelation was tem
pered to the capacity of the recipient, as
in the text, .''Ye cannot bear them now."
There was much in nature that was not
revealed. As the good works of men
brought them into better accord with the
spirit of their Master they would be able
to assimilate more of God's truth, and then
the truth would be more fully revealed to
them. . ;;;?;;/:-â¢
''So with us," he continued. "As we by
prayer, by suffering, by experience, enter
more fully into the appreciation of the
ever-present spirit of God, we also will be
led by the same spirit into fully under
standing the truth as it is in Jesus.
"Lent is especially the time for us to re
move such hindrances to the free course of
the Holy Spirit as lie within our own con
trol, ami therefore we are especially bidden
during the coming Lent by ministration,
by the struggle after personal purity, by
the giving of ourselves" and our substance
to bring ourselves â¢ into harmony with
God's Holy. Spirit, in order that. the same
Holy Spirit might illuminate us with the
brightness . and the fullness of the , Easter
revelation." â ' . ..'
, The Parish Report, just published, gives
an account of \ the, Easter services- as fol
lows: Wednesday, 10:30 a. m.; Thursday,

Where They Might Have Car

CAPTAIN WILLIAMS' IDEA.
Cruised in the Arctic Thirty Years and
Never Knew Natives to Send
. Information.
â¢ Captain : Louis Williams, who has been
making trips to the Arctic for â¢ the last
thirty years and who has during his nauti
cal experience acquired considerable
knowledge . of the northern seas and cur
rents, is much interested in the story of
the recent discovery of the pole by
Nansen. . > ', >â  â ; . . â 'if.
Twenty-five years ago, lone before the
first and only Western Arctic expedition
went out from San Francisco under the
command of De Long, he bad been as far
north as 74}Â£ deg. Since then, summer
after summer, he has cruised about the
Arctic on whaling voyages, far to the east
of Point Barrow, the most northern point
of Alaska, and as far to the westward of
Bering Strait as Cape Sievernoi, on the
Siberian Coast.
It was only last October that Captain
Williams was in the Arctic in command of
the Hidalgo. ;. â¢â¢;â¢..
Discussing yesterday the possibilities of
the recently reported discovery of the pole
by Nansen and the means by which the
news could have come from his ship, the
Fram, the captain said: .
"The telegraphic dispatches saying that
Nansen had 'â  been up to and was on his
way back from the . north pole did not
state where the Fram was at the time the
information was obtained, nor were any
dates given. If we were told anything
definite as to the original source of the
report we might form some opinion as to
the probability of the discovery.
"It is a very peculiar time of year to re
ceive information from that region, for in
the winter everything is blocked. The
only : possible way for news to come from
the Fram would be for some one to leave
the Fram and reach a permanent settle
ment.
S "When Nansen started out on his expe
dition he entered the Arctic near Norway,
traveling round the pole upon a general
course opposite . to the direction of. the
hands of a clock. His purpose was, as I
understand it, to reach a point some dis
tance beyond the mouth of the Lena River
and there be taken up by the current in
.which the Jeannette was drifting when she
was crushed in the ice in June, 1838. ; ;
..'.'That Current the Jeanette was in was
carrying her along, about three miles
an hour just : before she ; was abandoned.
It was a branch of the Japan current
which bends up into the North Pacific and
there divides, one \ part coming down this
coast and the- other going on up through
Bering Strait. Just after entering the
Arctic , that . current branches again. A
main and well-known constant flow strikes
eastward past Point Barrow, at one or two
miles ;an hour, along the north . coast of
British America through the great archi
pelago and into Baffin's Bay ; \ there it turns
southward, carrying . the Greenland ice
bergs down into the Atlantic Ocean. But
the other branch bends to the northwest
and starts round the other side of the pole.
In that current the Jeannette was carried
along until she was almost on the opposite
side of .the pole from us. ; Nansen's plans
seem" ,to have been i based upon ' the ; hy
pothesis that the current must eventually
bend in a upon the -; pole, : and ; crossing it,
come out on the coast of Greenland. But
I never , believed that story about some of
the Jeannette's material being found on the
coast of Greenland, /.and I don't believe
it yet. / â¢â¢;â  .--',:; . 'â¢
1 "Now; if this information came by way
of the coast, near the mouth of the Lena
River it passed through the hands of Rus
sian Government officials, â *â  for wherever
there is a permanent .settlement near that
coast -there are -.t Russian '|| officials. But
there is no living about the mouth 1 of j the
Lena, for its big delta is covered l with
drift ice in i the spring and â no habitation:
could -exist. The , river is over 2000. miles
long, and when ~ the snows at its source
melt ; the whole country is flooded about
the delta and is covered with sheet ice.
"The t first permanent i settlement that
Melville \ found when he was picked up in
October, 1888, was. about- 250" miles back
from the mouth of the Lena.; Why should
Nansen after reaching the pole go back, to
land nearly three times as far away as the
already explored coast of Greenland? If
he reached the .pole on : that current he
would naturally have staved with it and
come out on it. - Why. would he go back
1200 miles when' by keeping on about 400
he could reach known waters?
"The Fram had Only arrived in the
neighborhood of the Kara Sea for her first
winter. She must have done some.very
quick work compared with her sailing up
to that time to have gone to the pole and
started back since then,
â¢ "As for the natives communicating with
one another by some mysterious means and
at long distances, I have never, seen it.
The news could hardly have come In ad
vance by such means. There is no com
munication between the natives by signals.
When two natives from different villages
meet, they sit down and smoke a- pipe and
exchange the. gossip of their localities.
In that country the family lives upon
what the men and boys can hunt and fish
for and consequently there isn't any wan
dering from home. In the winter season
particularly the native stays at home
pretty faithfully. ... â  . . â¢
."Natives living sixty or seventy miles
apart know simply nothing about each
other, even where in many cases it would
be to their advantage to communicate with
each 0ther. .."... - ;-. t ;-:c â¢;-. >U;V
s"You can get a native to carry a message
lor you but must always have the pay
issued at the other end or he will fall from
grace and disappoint you. They do all
such traveling on land by dog teams and
cover from twenty-live to forty miles a
day. - " â  . . ,
"It is only the shore natives that have
and use canoes. When they sight a ship
they come off to her with their whole fam
ilies with them. It is like going â¢to the
opera. And they'll stay with you as long
as you'll let them..
"Occasionally we have received informa
tion from natives near Bering Strait
that would be accurate, but never any
from the Siberian coast natives in the Arc
tic. They are visited by Russian authori
ties only once or twice a year. All east of
the Lena on the Siberian coast the natives
understand that if a vessel is wrecked they
should care for the survivors..
"It freezes pretty solid in that north
ern region during the winter months.
Then there is not much movement to the
ice, although there are open spaces in it.
"Nothing hollow has ever yet been built
that could stand the pressure of two great
ice fields coming together. The Fram
was designed to avoid "the crush of the ice
by allowing herself to be forced up out of
water by the pressure upon her sides. The
ice in the northern seas is not high above
water, for it is not made up of icebergs.
Icebergs are made only on high shores
and break off of glaciers. They are not
found so far north. /,..
"When He Long started out on his ex
pedition an old skipper at the Palace Ho
tel told him that if he got in that north
west current it would either carry him to
the pole or to the devil. If Nansen got in
that current he was subject to either out
come." : T- /.>â â ! -..' .
ON IRELAND'S NATAL DAY
The Convention Will Hold the
Exercises at Woodward's
Pavilion. >
K. R. B. Members Preparing to Cele
brate the Anniversary of
Emmet's Birthday.
The St. Patrick's day convention, which
met at K. R. B. Hall, corner of O'Farrell
and Mason streets, yesterday afternoon,
decided to hold the exercises attending the
celebration of . the anniversary of the
apostle of . Ireland in the. new pavilion at
Woodwards Gardens. The exercises will
be of a musical and literary nature.
There was a large attendance at yester
day's meeting, and the proceedings were
full of life and interest. Thomas R. Ban
nerman occupied the chair, and Robert
O'Reilly recorded the minutes of the meet
ing- . ';â  ,:-V/ :
Several enthusiastic speeches were made
during the afternoon. To judge from the
interest already aroused over the.approach
ing celebration the belief is general among
the patriotic members that a large sum
"will be realized for the hall fund.
Active preparations are also going on
for the reception to John F. Finerty, who
will lecture at Metropolitan Hall on the
evening of March 4, Emmet's birthday. He
will arrive here on March 2. The commit
tee on arrangements will meet at K. R. B.
Hall on Wednesday, evening.
Already a large number of tickets have
been sold for the lecture. Colonel Finerty's
subject will be "The Life of Robert Em
met." During" his stay in San Francisco
the lecturer will be the guest of the K. R.
B. The society will also entertain him at
a banquet. ; - ;' - 1 "
SOCIALIST MEETING.
Co-operation in the Production, but Not
in the Distribution of Wealth.
"How and to what extent do we now
co-operate?" was the main subject of dis
cussion at the Socialist meeting last night
in Pythian Temple at 909 Market street.
T. E. Zant was the speaker of j the even
ing. He called attention to the natural co
operation existing in plant and lower ani
mal life, and :in the general economy of
the forces of nature. But he" declared
that there is no ' large social co-operation.
Such co-operation as exists in civilized
communities is confined to small groups
of people engaged in some co-operative
production.. Although they co-operate in
making the product they do not in dis
tributing it; that is the individualistic act
of the employer. '' â 
Then "followed a general expression of
ideas by different speakers, particularly
noticeable among whom was Mrs. "8 res
of Oregon, who declared that the Socialists
of her State were more thoughtful in re
gard to the topics of the day than her im
mediate auditors in this City. E. T. Kings
ley concluded what had become. almost a
spirited debate. He said that greenbacks
are not money because they are merely a
printed promise to pay money;. that bor
rowed money is the property of the bor
rower because he has traded' security for
it,' which he may or may not at some fu
ture time . buy back with the original
amount plus the interest; that his hearers
had no right to the ballot, the Government
being founded on property rights, and
none of his auditors owned any property.
Too Much China New Year,
T. Makinoto and VK. Mochita, two Japanese
young men, celebrated the Chinese New Year
yesterday by quarreling after they refreshed
themselves too freely. Makinoto, who is 18
years old, chased Mochita out of their house at
1 Chatham place ana pursued him down Bush
street to Dupont with an open knife in his
hand. Officers stopped the race Defore blood
was shed and Mochita was arrested for exhibit
ing a deadly weapon in a threatening manner,
while the object of > his wrath, whom \ he de
scribed as his "very dear friend," was booked
as drunk. - .

WHAT MAKES A
GOOD CITIZEN
Several Speeches on This
Topic at Metropolitan
Hall.
KUDSLSON'S ILL HEALTH
He Refrains in Consequence From
Giving Further Proper
Definitions.
SCHOOLS AND FRATERNITIES.
They Are Made the Subject of a Dis
course by One A. P. A.
Speaker.
Despite the manifold allurements to out
door amusement afforded by the beautiful
weather of yesterday, there was, if any
thing, an added attendance at the Good :
Citizenship meeting at Metropolitan Hall,
drawn thither by the announcement that
the speaker of the day was to be B. F.
Hudelson, the State president of the Amer
ican Protective Association. There were
the usual opening remarks by Chairman
Quitzow, instrumental and vocal musical
selections, and a prayer by Rev. Dr. C. A.
Rabinc. Then C.G.Dodge spoke briefly
as follows :
"You have assembled here to-day for the
purpose of again listening to him whom
you have chosen as your honored and re
spected leader in California. It certainly
cannot be an ordinary condition of affairs
which week after week fills this vast audi
torium with such an assemblage of intelli
gent and patriotic Americans. It shows that
you are alive to the dangers that threaten
American institutions and are determined
to protect your rights. This is no battle
of religion. It is a battle for freedom and
religious liberty in its nearest sense. If
there is one lesson by which the Ameri
can people are quick to profit by it is ex
perience. We know the history of our
country; wo know her imperial position
among the nations of to-day; we know
that most of her greatness has been the
work of her public schools. With loyal
Americans their position is to be the
proper educators, and their patriotic tend
encies demand no argument. It is sim- i
ply a question of their eternal preserva
tion.
"From the associations of childhood and
from the lessons of experience we have
come to look upon the public school'
almost with reverence. And there are
other institutions that have become dear
to the hearts of Americans. I refer to the
fraternal organizations, all of which have
come under the ban oi the Pope.
"Will some Catholic champion tell me
what these organizations have done that
they have become the object of insult by
the" Pope?"
The speaker then paid a glowing tribute
to the virtues of these organizations and
went on as follows:
"These will live, together with our pub
lic schools, when Papal insult and the
Papacy shall no longer exist. We honor
and respect everything that bears the sem
blance of loyalty and liberty.
"I believe in protecting the industries of
our country, but I think that is absurd
while immigration is unrestricted. In
many of the Eastern States American
citizens have been driven from the fac- ,
tories by foreign laborers. Such a spec
tacle, my friend, is a sad commentary on ,
the constitution of America. We are a
patient and lorbearing people, and for :
my individual self I do not believe in pro- I
tecting a poisonous reptile. . I believe, as
Wendell Phillips did, that it should be
crushed in infancy. Already we have had
an example of the terrors of unrestricted
immigration, and if public men will not
pass the proper laws for the restriction of
immigration, then you, who have the
remedy in your hands, should relegate him
to the oblivion where he belong.
"In conclusion let me say that you have
some cause for congratulation. Already
this agitation has brought a great change
in thesentimentof our people. It was not
long ago that foreign flags were floating
over many of our public buildings; but
now we have a law in New York prohibit- â¢
ing the display of any other flag than the
stars and stripes on a -public building.
Let that agitation go on till we have the
same law in every State in the Union. Let
us impress upon our children the import
ance of our public schools and the fur
ther importance of unsectarian institu
tions." :.^ : ;.
Chairman Quitzow at this point an
nounced that there was a mistake in the
printed programme regarding the dates on
which the Yorke-Ross controversy was to
be held in Metropolitan -Temple. He
stated that the correct dates were Feb
ruary 24, 25. 26 and 27. "-erf ..:
Rev. W. R. Goodwin of the California
street Methodist Episcopal . Church was
the next speaker. He explained that be
had been asked to come to the . meeting to
speak, as it were between times, and added :
"Where our friend Father YorKe now isâ
that is, between times he is between Rev.
Mr. Wendte and Mr. Hudelson; but I am
not here to talk to. you about Father
Yorke; he will get enough from others. I
want to say that I have words of warning.
We have got to look after the citizenship
of this City. I am going to give a little
talk about its moral . condition. I have
never believed in bringing politics into
municipal affairs. I- don't care who is
Mayor so long as he is - the best man for
that position in the â¢ city: When we come
to municipal affairs give us ' the very best
man in the city irrespective of politics.
"How are you going to get the best men
for your offices? You must first select
them and then vote for them. What are
we doing toward this end? That is the'
question. These meetings won't count
anything at all on the day of election.
When election day comes the judges won't
count speeches nor songs,- but will count
ballots first, last and all the time. We
have got to get down to balloting.
"I was inclined to blame the "Mayor. for
some things, but the Mayor says his hands
are tied. He says the Board of Supervisors
is'responsiole for the condition of things.
We go to the Supervisors, say 'we are hon
est and virtuous and 'we are loyal and we
would love to make this City what it ought
to be, but we have no power.' Then we go
to the judges, who say that the laws are
against them. And- so here we are. No
Mayor, Supervisors or Judges who can
help us, but we have one thine left us and
that is the newspapers. But now they
must first settle the scandal over on Post
street, then they will have some time to
give us their help.'
"What are we going to do about this
state of affairs? . I say that all good citi
zens of whatever sect or religion who have
a ballot would see that that ballot goes in
for good government. I get tired of hear
ing the men of Nob Hill complain of
things, and that they will not see that
things start right at the foundation, such
as the primary. If these Nob Hill preach
ers would only get down to ; earth â  long
enough to do something they might ac
complish something. A man ought to
quit praying who quits voting. .'.
"Occasionally we find a man who is too
religions to come to the ballot-box to vote.
When I come across such a man I tell him
that the sooner he goes to heaven the bet
ter. 'â¢"'â  ,' .
"What San Francisco needs to-day is
awakening of consciences, an awakening
of the leading citizens of this City. We
turn over the government to the ignorant.
I am only a boy, but I hope to see the day
when no man shall be allowed to put his
ballot into the ballot-box till he can read
that ballot in the English language. [Ap
plause.] I hope to see the day when not
only the men but the women shall be able
to do that.*ggg3BQÃ|
"What concerns us to-day is good citi
zenship and that will come only out of the
right kind of ballot, and the right kind of
! ballots should be cast at the primary. We
must have men in every office in tne City
and have respect for our rights, but more
respect for the rights of the community.
"I am simply here to say that it is our
duty to see that when the next election
comes that we turn the rascals out; don't
turn the rascals in.
"I would like to have every man who
holds an office in America to be an Ameri
can. Not a man necessarily born in this
country, but if when-' be ''came to this
country he did not become an American I
say that he should be born again.
"We ought to clean out our poolrooms,
our gambling places and our streets ought
to be cleaned even if we have to pour
along them streams of fire.
"I hope some minister who is not under
the influence of some one who owns a
good deal of pronerty â 1 every now and
then think I am in Cnicago; l" forget that
I am in a community where nobody owns
a preacher but want to say that 1 know
some preachers whose lips cannot be pad
locked.
"Just as soon as the preachers and
schoolteachers and lawyers and. rich men'
all agree on one point, the newspapers will
agree on that point, too. That is to say. I
think they will and hope they will, and I
believe they will; that just as soon as they
see which way the cat is going to jump,
they will jump ahead of the cat.
hen "we get outside of this hall, what
ever our principles may be, each one of us
should become an individual committee
; for the reform of this City. We can ac
complish it, and we ought to do it, and by
the grace of God we will do it."
In announcing President Hudelson the
chairman stated that he had just got up
from a bed of sickness and was therefore
not prepared to do as good service to the
cause as would have otherwise been the
case. The appearance of the speaker
| called forth hearty and prolonged ap-
p lause from the audience. He spoke as
follows:
"ladies. Gentlemen and Fellow-Citizens
of San Francisco: It seems to me that it
would be well to dismiss this meeting this,
afternoon with what has been so well and
forcibly stated in your hearing. lam sure
that there is not a lady or gentleman with
in these four wails who does not appreciate
more fully their responsibility at the bar
of their country after listening to the well
chosen .words of the previous speaker.
"There are several questions being dis
cussed at the present time and among
them is that question of the necessity of
' the organization known as the A. P. A.
[Applause.] '
"When I see four million and a half or
five million men coming together in an
organization like this within the short
space of nine years; when I see half a
million of American women banding
themselves into an. organization as an
auxiliary of the A. P. A. within the last .
very few years; when I see the boys
and girls of America between the
years of 10 and 18 banding them
selves together into another organiza
tion auxiliary to the- A. P. A. 1 come
to the conclusion at once that certainly
there must be a reason and a very good
reason for such an uprising in a country
hke ours. And so to you, my fellow citi
zens, the existence of these organizations
must argue most conclusively the neces
sity for their existence. They have al- j
ready accomplished a very great work.
"It is true there was a dearth -of
patriotism in the land. I am very glad
that our Catholic friends are becoming so
patriotic. . There is to be a Catholic
patriotic turnout on Washington's birth
day and they are putting the American
flag on their schools and are shouting their
patriotism louder than anybody else."
President Hudelson then related the
j story of the preacher who had exhausted
i his list of sermons and who, on his congre
gation insisting that he should preach
once more, utilized a discourse on hell.
i "It was a most eloquent sermon," said the
speaker,, "and those present declared that
they could almost smell the fumes of the
burning sulphur and brimstone. At its
conclusion ah old gentleman in the front j
row started to sing the hymn, 'We will j
soon be at home over there.-'
. "These patriotic Catholics ought to be j
singing this sons. In fact they ought to
have begun singing it a long time'ago.
"While I love to see the celebration of
Washington's birthday, I don't like to see
that occasion celebrated as Y. M. I. day,
nor as A. P. A. day. I would rather see it
celebrated as Washington's birthday, as of
old.
"If you will bear with me for just a mo
ment I will call your attention to the con
stitution of the State of California regard
ing a certain matter. I refer to Article 43,
Section 22." 'Â.-'
He. then read this section and also Sec
tion 30 of the same article as follows :
No money shall be drawn from the treasury
but in consequence of appropriations made by
law and upon warrants duly drawn thereon
by the Controller; and no money shall ever be
appropriated or drawn from the State treasury
for the use or benefit of any corporation, asso
ciation, asylum, hospital or any other institu
tion not under the exclusive management and
control of the State as a State Institution, nor
shall any grant or donation of property ever be
made thereto by. the State; provided that, not
withstanding anything contained in this or
any other section of this constitution, the Leg
islature shall have the power to grant aid to
institutions conducted â¢ for the support and
maintenance of minor orphans.or half-orphans,
or abandoned children; or aged persons in indi
gent circumstances â aid to be granted by
a uniform rule, and proportioned to the num
ber of inmates of such respective institutions:
provided further that the State shall have at
any time the right to inquire into the manage
ment of such institution; provided further,
that whenever any county, or city or county,
or city, or town/shall provide for the support
of minor orphans, or half-orphans, or aban
doned children, or aged persons in indigent
circumstances, such county, city or county,
city or town, shall be entitled to receive the
same pro rata appropriations as may be
granted to such institutions under church or
other control. An accurate statement of the
receipts and expenditures of public moneys
shall be attached to and published with the
laws at every regular session of the Legis
lature. . - , ' . . ~ â¢
Neither the Legislature nor any county, '
city and county, -township, school district
or other 'â  municipal corporation shall ever

public 'fund- whatever, or â _â  grant any

sect, church, creed or sectarian purpose, or
j help to support or sustain any school, college,
j university, hospital or. other institution con
trolled by any religious creed, church or sec
tarian denomination whatever; nor shall any
! grant or donation of personal property or real
I estate ever be made by the State or any city,
city and county, town or other municipal cor
poration for any â¢ religious creed, church or
sectarian purpose whatever, provided that
nothing in this sections hall prevent the Legis
lature granting aid. pursuant? to section 22 of
this article. â¢
Continuing, he said': "I would like to
! ask why in the face of the constitution of
j the State of California there has been paid
j $15 per month out of the treasury of this
City for the keeping of girls in an institu-
I tion -that is under the direct control of a
j religious body? These girls are placed
I there as criminals. You may state that
; the city has passed an ordinance authoriz
| ing this thing. I say that it is in violation
jof the constitution. It shows a disregard
! for our constitution.: It is unbecoming
| that these people who shout patriotism
| and loyalty and obedience to the law
should be violating American institutions.

Tory when it has been finally won. * This
fight has been before the people for some
time. Up -to 1892 there were other than
the Roman Catholic churches drawing
money from the National Treasury for In
dian missions, but : in- 1892 the other
churches withdrew." . ;
The speaker then read . the various reso
lutions passed by the great Protestant de
nominational bodies of the country declar
ing against and refusing to further accept
Government aid for Indian schools and
missions. "That," said the speaker, "is
American." He next related the hearing
before the Indian Commissioners on this
subject in December,; 1893, at. which all
the different religious and sectarian or
ganizations were represented. He added
that J. A. Stevens, representing the Catho
lic church, charged that those who asked
for the withdrawal of Government aid
from Indian schools and missions did so
with a design of driving the Catholic
church out of this particular field and
that their efforts savored strongly of
hypocrisy. Following this line of thought
he said:
"I say this is not so. I hope that all the
different religious organizations will goon
with their work in the Indian missionary
field. Let them work among the Indians
as long as they please. Let them plan
their schools and carry on their religious
teachings if they want to, and if it is in
the power of any one of them to run all
the others out let them do so, but not with
Government aid. This is un-American;
this is Jesuitical.
"They are opposed to withdrawing pub
lic appropriations for the .support of sec
tarian schools and opposed to the unsecu
larization of those schools. The A. P. A.
says attain that this is going to stop. [Ap
plause.] It is. only a question of time.
The American people are determined. We
believe In the fundamental principle of
our Government. We believe in uphold
ing our own institutions.
"Some one might say that I have made
a very harsh statement, but when I see
and the American people behold Pope Leo
XIII on the Tiber saying to the American
citizens, 'You must withdraw from the
Masons, from the Odd Fellows; yon must
withdraw from the Knights of Pythias,
the Sons of Temperance, because I, Pope
Leo XIII, in Rome, Italy, place those in
stitutions in America under the ban,' I
believe that it is about time that the
American people should stand up for the
fundamental principles of the American
Government, and I believe it is time the
"American, people should place every Jes
uitical organization under the ban to that
extent that wo invite them to say good-by
to America. If this were done there would
be a cry go up of persecution. The Pope
would say that the American has taken
action against the Catholic societies. But
what has he said about the Pope taking
action against our American societies?
Not a word. And we now properly ask
the question, Who commenced the putting
under a ban, anyway?
"Fellow-citizens. I had proposed to
speak to you to-day upon the continuation
of the proper definitions of the planks of
the platform of the A. P. A., but I have
not taken up that subject at all; nor shall
I take it up at this time. Were it not that
I had been advertised for this platform to
day I would not have been with youâ l
would have been in my bed.
"I believe that the time is not far dis
tant that the sentiment that is being
molded through the width and breadth of
our land by the A. P. A, will result in bet
ter government, in the perfection of our
plans that America is to be America in the
true sense of Americanism â that all are to
be equal; that the church is to be recog
nized by the State. ' â¢
"When next November will have come
and gone I believe that the A. P. A. will
have led one of the most glorious victories
and that that victory will have perched on
our banner and that the old patriots will
look upon our flag and feel that America
has been rescued from her enemies.
"This organization is not ah organiza
tion to go against that man or that woman
or girl and prosecute them because they
are Cotholics, and I ara ashamed of the
man or woman who when confronted with
great questions as these, standing on great
principles, will so far lose sight of the issue
as to commence a personal fight against
'some individual because of his religion.
We are not engaged in any such fight, but
we are going to stand for the true princi
ples of Americanism, and on these princi
ples we are going to march into victory
next November."
FOUNDATIONS OF FAITH.
Dr. York In Reply to Father
Wyman's and Archbishop
Riordan 's Lectures.
Following is the lecture of Dr. J. L.
I York, delivered last evening at Scottish
i Hall,, in reply to the lectures of Father
' Wyman and Archbishop Riordan at Met
ropolitan Temple on last Monday and
Friday evenings respectively:
Ladies and Gentlemen: Our subject this
evening is a reply to the lectures at the temple
! on the "Foundation of Catholic Faith." We
, deny the truth of the Catholic faith as pre
j sented, by Archbishop Riordan and Father
l Wyman at the Metropolitan Temple the past
j week on the following grounds:
Firstâ That the entire system of Christianity
| is based upon faith, and that human reason
I and the facts of nature are made subservient
j to faith, and belief in that, which is not sus
ceptible of demonstration, and, to say the
least, is doubtful of truth.
Secondâ That they fail to prove the divine
origin of Christianity, the fall of man, the
divinity of Jesus, the plenary inspiration of
the Bible or any of the essential features upon
which Christianity rests, and is all based upon
assumption. We denyâ â 
Thirdâ That the Hebrew . Bible contains a
| simile passage or prophecy which, taken in its
true sense, points to the birth, life or death of
| Jesus of Nazareth, or any proof- that commends
\ itself to reason, or is in harmony with the facts
| of nature, going to show that the miracles re
cited in the New Testament ever took place, j
and have no real foundation, save that credence |
which takes root in. ignorance and supersti- I
tion. And that the traditions, fictions and
wonderful stories written up by the ear'y i
monks, under the title of Matthew, Mark, Luke
and John (whoever they were), are tor the most
part exaggerated statements, if not pure fabri
cations, which have been canonized by hu
man authority and passed down to this age at
the hands of the Roman > Catholic Church,
THE NEW POLICE HALL PLANS.

claiming to be the only true salvation for man
kind. And, to say the : least, the arrogance of
her claims must be shocking to all who are ac
quainted with the j facts in the history of her
bloody career in ihe world.
v\e do not say that the Roman Church . has
accomplished no good in the world, but we do
say. that she has been the fruitful source of far
more evil than good In the world, and that her
efforts for supremacy have marked her path
way with strife, persecution, cruelty* tears and
biood ; and her , attitude, to-day toward free
thought, free speech, free schools and mental
liberty show her to be the same relentless foe
of free religion and true democracy.
we do not say that her men are all disloyal
to our Government, but we do say that their
opposition to our free-school system, and the
statements of those high in Catholic authority
against our system of free schools during forty
years past . was, as every true American must
admit, an attack : upon the very citadel of
American liberty and the popular theory that
the perpetuity of our free Institutions depends
upon the protection of our school system ; and
the Catholic war and extreme statements, Be
ginning with Bishop Hughes of New York
until now, could have no other tendency than
to create a strong suspicion of disloyalty to the
principles of free government on the part of
the leaders of the Roman church, and no
amount of denial, sophistry and slippery con
fusion of words can wipe out the significance
and effect of the Catholic attitude toward our
schools.
We do not say that Catholic women are not
quite as chaste and as faithful wives, mothers
and daughters as others of Protestant faith, or
those of no religious faith. Human nature is
about the same in the church as outside of it.
Morality, goodness, benevolence and chastity
do not belong alone to the church, nor are
they due to any religious belief, but to tbe in
stincts oi a common humanity. And the fact
that sisters and nuns are found on the battle
field, in the hospital soothing the sufferings of
the dying and ministering to the wants of the
poor and distressed no sane person will deny,
But we cannot believe that the ministries of
these good angels are due to the Catholic
religion, or what these sisters of mercy happen
to believe about God, heaven or purgatory,
but rather, to their humanity, and . that
Protestant women are quite as benevo
lent and. chaste as others. And Rev.
Father Wyman's statement in his lecture at
the Metropolitan Temple "That the idea of the
sanctity of marriage is lost among the majority
of those who are not of our faith," was an in
sult to every woman outside of the Catholic
church. "He said farther that marriage out
side of their church was for the most part for
pleasure and their children are not consid
ered a blessing from God, and if God should
say I will destioy San Francisco unless I find
ten just persons, where should we first look for
them? All our people would instinctively
turn to our convents and religious houses."
Great heavens, what arrogance and what
cruel impertinence is this? Well.it is nothing
new. â¢ It is an open statement of Romanism,
that the "marriage of Protestants is the mar
riage bed of adultery, and their children the
bastards of a cursed union."
This is the language of the highest Catholic
authority, the so-called church of God. We are,
then, to look for virtue in convents and Cath
olic prisons, where men and women are shut
away from the sunlight and green fields, deny
ing themselves of the natural an.d kindly asso
ciations of human life under the pretense of
serving God. What a lean, pinched-up virtue
this must be. What is this but the mental dis
ease called religion? Heaven save me and
mine from such a horrid and unnatural re
ligion as this.
But how do we know that virtue exists in
such large degree in the convents and nun
neries? How can we tell what is concealed un
der the garb of self-abnegation when the out-
side world is not permited to see and talk with
the prisoners? And am Ito take Father Wy
man's word for all this virtue shut up in these
.unwholesome places called religious? -
Would it not be well to open out these vir
tuous retreats at least once a year for ventila
tion and prove to the world the superiority of
Catholic virtue? /
We think it a good service to the unregener
ate world to have the curtain drawn aside and
the cover lifted from the church now and
again so that, sinners may know how them
selves compare in point of morality and virtue
with saints of God. And no doubt the outside
world were greatly surprised and pleased to
find so much morality and virtue in Brother
Brown's church when the cover was lifted off.
And I do think that those who have religion
are almost as good as those who have no re
ligion. And we suggest to Father Wyman to
have the cover removed from those holy places
of which he speaks before he delivers another
such an unjust tirade in favor of catholic vir
tue. ;V
Now then, as the truth or falsity of the Cath
olic faith turns on the question of the divinity
of Jesus of Nazareth, permit us to .propound a
few questions, partly in the language of a
noted author, to Father Wyman, Bishop
Kiordan and other clergy in this city, touching
the most vital points in the foundation of the
Catholic faith, the chief of which . is the
divinity of Jesus. What is truth? Truth Is
the right relation of things. What is tbe truth
about Jesus? And is Jesus a correct standard
for truth? ; Nothing but perfection can be a
standard for complete truth. And does the
life of Jesus, from the scanty record in- the
New Testament, show him to be a perfect char
acter? And from our reading we must con
clude that the man Jesus was far from perfec
tion, and in no sense a perfect standard for
truth. - -
If Jesus was divine, how could he teach that
moral' merit depends upon religious belief,
when no one can control his belief more
than one can control the color of â¢ his eyes or
the length of his stature or color of his hair?
How could he say "Let him who is without
sin cast the first stone?" This carried out in
practical life would exempt every criminal on
earth and defeat the ends of justice.
If he was a perfect character, how could he
say to the poor woman, "It is not meet to take
the children's bread and east it to the dogs";
and why, if a God, could he term any of his
children Gentiles and dogs ?"
If perfect, or even a wise man, why should
he curse the fig tree because it was barren at
the wrong time of the year'; And why did he
not destroy the devils.instead of destroying his
neighbor's property and food for the hungry?
Why, if a wise man, did he promise the dis
ciples that, If they would believe in him, they
should sit on twelve thrones, judging the
twelve tribes of Israel? Did they do so? No
such thing ever occurred. And" why did he
denounce whole cities, both innocent and
guilty, because they refused his disciples as
their teacher, as stated in Matthew's gospel ?
How could he say, if a good man, "Bring
hither my enemies and slay them before me,
those who will not have me rule over, them"?
In this he proposes to render evil for evil
not much like an infinite God. Had Jesus
been a berfect or a wise man, how could he
have laid the foundation of Roman popery and
created the first Pope, as recorded in Matt.
xvi:18?
Why should he, If he knew what frail, falli
ble and wicked men would do, say unto Peter,
a coward and a liar, "Thou art Peter, and upon
this rock I will build my church," if he did not
mean to establish Popery in the world? And
why did he, if a divine character and with the
foreknowledge of a God, have said to Peter,
"Whatsoever thou .shall bind on earth shall be
bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt
loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven," and
thus establish Popery with its confession-box
and a long and cruel legacy of despotism, war,
priestcraft, persecution and bloodshed. to es
tablish the abomination of mental ' and spirit
ual slavery and the . very throne of Popery in
the world? And if Jesus did not intend to' do
this evil recorded In Matthew he was not a
, God; and if only a man, he was not perfect or
wise, take either horn that seems best.
How can Jesus be a perfect standard of truth
when he ; predicted the end of the world to be
near at hand? and fanatics have been doing
the same ever since.' How could he, if I divine,
have said, "Blessed are. the poor, but woe to
the rich," -when poverty, claimed-as a Catholic
virtue, is no doubt the greatest cause of misery,
vice, prostitution, intemperance and crime in
the world ?
Why should Jesus, if a sensible man, have
uttered such foolish sentiments about endless
punishment, everlasting fire against those who
did not believe in him, and that he would re-'
turn in the clouds" after death. And why did
he utter such nonsense about marriage arid di
vorce when he should have known, if a God,
that there, are other just causes for divorce
than he gives, and in his example he has set
the pattern for the unwholesome practice of
celibacy among priests and nuns of the Roman
Catholic church ?
And for Protestant' Christians to deny the
foundation 'of the Catholic faith Is like the man
who sawed off the limb of the tree upon which
he stood. â¢ How could Jesus, if a perfect char
acter, have chosen a thief for his associate?
And that he did not know his true character
Jesus admits when he quotes and applies to
himself the words of David. "Mine own famil
iar friend which did eat of my bread, and in
whom I trusted, Jiath lifted up his heel against
me." Showing clearly that Jesus did not know
the character of Jesus, and if not how could he
have been what is claimed for him?. â¢
A perfect standard of tjuth and justice
would have rebuked the sin of slavery and
condemned in unmistakable terms this cruel
crime against God and man when it was the
widespread evil of his time? He found the
world in slavery and left it in slavery. And
only the heaven-born inspiration of Thomas
Paine ana the white-souled Lincoln, in his
proclamation, could say man has no right of
property in man and thus lay the ax at the
. ; root of slavery. -;:â - â¢:
Had Jesus the attributes of God, why did he
j not point out the great sin of despotic govern
; ment and tyranny and teach the people that
j all true government should come from the
I consent of the g'overened?
Why did he not teach the importance of edu
! cation and science, which alone has made this
world- a suitable place to live in. instead of
\ laying the foundation of a religious despotism
i in the world? Why did he, If he knew all
' things, make wine for a. party of people when
they were already, drunken and set such an
â  example of intemperance, the greatest evil in
| the world? If Jesus was a standard for justice
I and equal rights why did he leave woman to
; suffer under the old Jewish law of divorce in
; stead of teaching our true relations in this
| life? And so far as may be known -he gave to
I the world no important, original doctrine,
! knowledge, art, science, discovery or inven
i tion and furnished little new light to the un
j derstanding upon any of the second-hand doc
trines which he taught, and yet we are re
quired to believe that he was a god In order to
I be saved. \ â¢
An infinite being could not have been born
!of woman, as other men are born nor could
I an infinite being die as Jesus died. John Huss,
Vanlni, Socrates and Bruno died more like
I gods than did the man of Nazareth. And from
j the half historical and half legendary accounts
i of Jesus we cannot regard him as divine in the
j Christian sense, and yet we admire him for his
bravery in attacking the superstitions of the
i church in his day. and we love him as an ideal
j of benevolence, honesty and goodness, and one
ofthe saviors of mankind; but as to his di
vinity, we are compelled to be unitarian, and
yet we have the highest regard for those who
sincerely differ with us in religious belief; but
hypocrisy and sham we utterly detest.
In religion we are a liberal. We know only
a few things, are agnostic in many things and
our realm of . belief is very small, but are
doing our level beÂ«t to hold our grip on com
mon-sense and in 1 our humble way to repre
sent and voice the sentiments of the un
churched, who believe that a clean, honest
) moral life is a sufficient passport to another
and higher life. And the -above questions,
j touching the cornerstone in the foundation
j of the Christian church, we most respectfully
j refer to Bishop Riordan, Father Wyman and
other clergy of the City, and when they will
i answer these questions in such a manner as
! to remove my doubts -as to the divinity of
! Jesus we will join the Roman Catholic church ;
I without delay. : >'" j
FOE THE SYNAGOGUE.
A Successful Ball at Union-Square Hall
Last Evening.
Union-square Hall, on Post street, was
thronged until early this morning by a
gay crowd of dancers that had gathered
to enjoy, a programme on which there
were seventeen numbers and indirectly to
aid the Stockton-street Synagogue, for the
benefit of which the affair had heen ar
ranged. ' ' _.--* â¢
. The idea originated with I. Friedman,
president of the congregation, of which
D. Gilaberg is vice-president and S. Pol
lock secretary.
Over 750 tickets were sold and conse
quently many of the contributors to the
church fund were unable to take active
part in the entertainment.-
To the young men composing the several
committees the credit for the preparations
and successful management of the affair is
due. On' the committee of arrangements
; were: M. Silberst in, J. Kiarnet, G. Sil

Does Not Consider the Blanchard
Charge Worthy a Sec

THREATS AGAINST THE PASTOR,
The Whereabouts : of Mrs. Tunnell
. Causes Alarm in the Ranks of ,
Dr. Brown's Friends.
" ~
The partisans of Mrs. Brown and Mrs.
Cooper were kept busy yesterday discuss
ing the sensational charges preferred by
the former against the latter. One faction
claimed that the affidavits practically
killed the pastor, while the other side con
tended that they meant the utter annihi
lation of Mrs. Cooper.
Before and after church the friends of
each gathered in little groups, apparently
to congratulate one another that the
charge of ballot stuffing had been made.
Mrs. Brown's friends said that Mrs. Cooper
did not dare deny the accusations, while
the followers of the latter argued that the
very characters of the people making the
charges, stamped it as unworthy of a
moment's consideration. ;,-;â 
Mrs. Cooper, while deeply regretting
that any one, even her enemies, should
believe her capable of committing the acts
charged, declines to even consider the
matter seriously. She says that her sim
pl3 denial is proof positive that the affi
davits are without foundation in fact.
Further than this she will not even dis
cuss the matter.
"It is not true that Dr. Brown stood one
minute either on Mrs. Blanchard's door
step or in her house," said the pastor's
wife yesterday, "except in company with
Notary W. B. Benchley. Now as to Mrs..
Blanchard's statement. She made it Fri
day evening about 6 o'clock, and it was
taken down by the shorthand writer. In
that condition it was, of course, not ready
for signature, so the notary arranged that
he and Dr. Brown should call the next
morning for that one purpose.
"The statement was made under oath
and was wholly voluntary. There was not
a hint of menace, as the' notary
will testify. When they called
the next morning, however, Mrs.
Blanchard refused to sign what she had
voluntarily sworn to the evening before.
Dr. Brown then set before her the serious
nature of her offense, and said that if she
did not choose to sign her own voluntary
statement, made under oath, he would con
sult the authorities. He told her that he
would not pass lightly by her intrusion j
into our church affairs, and her vote in a j
matter when she Had not 'the slightest !
right, and when such consequences to his
family and himself were involved. She I
then sighed the document.
"As to any contrary stories she may tell, ]
let it be remembered that on the authority ;
of her own sworn statement she is not a
truthful person. .She voted twice, not- j
withstanding her denial. The evidence is
overwhelming. Four or live more affi- !
davits from perfectly responsible persons
can be easily obtained. That second vote i
was procured by Mrs. Cooper after she had
been told by Mrs. Blanchard herself that !
she was not a member. Nothing could be
more astonishing than the lightness with
which Mrs. Cooper affects to regard her !
conduct in this matter. Congregational
churches do not lightly regard the corrup
tion of their suffrage. The facts of the
case were voluntarily laid before Dr.
Brown and the deacons last Wednesday j
evening by Mrs. Simpson.
"There is one clause in Mrs. Blanch- '
ard's affidavit which should be corrected.
The affidavit as published causes Mrs.
Blanchard to say: 'I told her I was not a j
member of the church and had no right
to vote, but still she urged me to do so.'
"The last eight word's should have been i
eliminated. The original document does
not contain these, words, and the notary
in making the copies failed to eliminate
them."
The attendance at Mrs. Coopers Bible
class was fully equal to that of the last
two Sundays. After the lesson many of
her friends and fifteen or twenty strangers
came forward and- assured her of their ;
confidence and esteem. They told her
that. she; was making a noble fight for
truth and principle, and regardless of what
might be said about her she must triumph
in the end. â¢
It was stated yesterday bya close friend
of Mrs. Cooper that she "had been ap
proacned by a number of gentlemen since
the publication of the Blanchard affidavit
who offered ' to ' protect her ; against any |
further attack. The story goes that these
men, if she but said the word, would or- j
ganize a committee of seventy,- with the
one object in view of expelling Dr. 1 Brown
from San Francisco.' It was proposed to !
give the reverend gentleman | forty-eight I
hours' notice to leave the City; then, if he !
did not accept the invitation, similar
measures to those used in earlier days
would be adopted. Mrs. Cooper declined j
to discuss the matter, except to say that
never, under any . circumstances, would
she consent to such a proposition.
It is said that the present whereabouts
of Mrs. Tunnell is causing the friends of
Dr. Brown considerable uneasiness. Just
what she will testify to in the event of her
appearance before the council is, of course,
unknown, hut it is generally supposed that
she would say things damaging to the
pastor. A fresh : story was started yester
day to the effect that Mrs. Tunnell was
without doubt in the city, but intended to
remain in hiding until called by Mrs. I
Cooper. '. .
Inquiry at the home of Mrs. Horton, 216
Eddy street, with whose mother at Vi- j
salia she is known to have spent some
days, elicited the information tnat sh^
had not heard of or from Mrs. Tunnell for
over a month. The same story was told
at 1041 Mission street, where the missing
witness lodged for some weeks prior to her
disappearance.
' - Attorney Gallagher is working on a new !
theory, in which Mrs.Tunnoll is involved.
He has certain evidence in his possession
now, but refuses to tell what it is until he
completes his investigation.:
Professor Lloyd occupied the First . Con
gregational . pulpit at both f morning and
evening services yesterday. Dr. Brown
and ; his, wife attended the forenoon ser
vice, but took.no part in the exercises. At
6:20 o'clock the pastor attended the regu
lar meeting of the Endeavorers.
,: The convening of the council- to-morrow
makes the fifty-second day since the scan
dal became public by reason of the arrest
of Mrs. Davidson. The council will proba
bly not consume more than half an hour
in ; organizing, after which they will -be I
ready to receive charges affecting the char
acter of ? the j pastor, s ; Mrs. Cooper will -. be
represented by Walter J. Barnett of - Gun
nison, Booth, <fe Barnett, and, Mrs. Stock
ton by J. H. Collins of Fresno.
Ingenious Jack. .
May I give another instance of the
p ower which dogs: teem to possess of un
' derstanding what is said in their presence?
I We have a black-and-tan terrier called
! Jack who has a rooted objection to spend
ing a night alone, arid is therefore allowed
to sleep with one of my brothers. A short
time ago they were all from home, and an
order was given early in the evening.(Jack
being present) that he was to sleep with
the groom, away from the house. Jack,
who always remains in the room until the
rest of the household retire, disappeared
this particular evening very soon after the
order was given and was not seen again.
.When we went upstairs, however, there he
was curled np in. an J armchair in .my
youngest sister's bedroom, evidently set
tle for the night, and as we entered he.
looked up and waeged his tail, as if he was
begging to be allowed to stay. ; As he had
never been known to go to bed early by
himself, or in that particular room, we all
felt sure he had understood the order and
hoped by this means to escape.â London

day preceding a concert and the concert
day itself in practicing. Yesterday was no
exception. From the time that he arose,
shortly after noon, until 9 o'clock in the
evening he played, preparing for the con
cert of. this afternoon.
During this time he had a slight lunch
eon, a bite that he was forced to take. His
first meal for the day, though, his break
fast, was not served until nearly 1Q o'clock
last night.
. This is merely an indication of the
great pianist's capacity for concentration.
San Francisco has been to him a source of
interesting study, He knew that yester
day would reveal to him more of the out
door life of the people than he could have
seen before. He wished to see the park
ana the cliff crowded with sightseers.
Yet he spent the entire day in his room
at the hotel. Many cards" were sent to
him. He was not at home to any one â he
never is when he practices. . .
"Whether this intense application is
necessary or not, I do not know," said Mr.
Goerlitz last night. . ''I know Paderewski
seems to think so, though, and he usually
does what, he thinks 19 necessary to pro
duce the best results with his art."
ENTERTAINED THE TARS.
Seamen From the Cristoforo
Colombo Feasted by the
Italian Colony.
Pretty Girls Lavish Smiles on the
â¢ Bronzed Sailor Men at Rersag-
lieri Hal!.
Feasting and dancing occupied tbe Ital
ian colony from early morning till after
midnight yesterday. The merry-making
was in honor of the sailors of the Cristo
foro Colombo. Heretofore the entertain
ing has heen principally of the officers.
Yesterday the men before the mast were
the heroes.
The fun began early in the morning. A
delegation of local Italians consisting of
A. Fodera, G. Gondona, G. Carapodonico,
G. F. Campodonico and G. Flamini went
to the Folsom-street wharf at 11:30 a.m.,
where they met fifty sailors and eight
officers from the Cristoforo Colombo. The
party, after indulging in some slight
liquid refreshments, proceeded to Marti
nelli's, where a banquet and a large party
of Italian gentlemen awaited them.
There was an Elaborate 'menu, to which
the sailor-boys did full justice. ' Then Dr.
Caglieri, who presided, made them a brief
speech of welcome. In his usual felicitous
manner. Chevalier J. Calegaris proposed a
toast to the visitors which was responded
to by Chief Engineer Guidi for the officers
of the Colombo and Compiano P. Ualco
for the men. There were many more
short speeches, but shortly after 2 o'clock
the entire party repaired" to Bersaglieri
Hall, to which they marched preceded by
a band. ':*'â ;.
â¢ More gentlemen and a. bevy of pretty
girls were in attendance there. Dancing
began at once and was kept up till 6
o'clock. Then there was an intermission,
when the guests were feasted, and later
the dancing was resumed with even more
pretty girls present than in the afternoon.
The ball continued till midnight.-
The affair was given by the Italians of
Oakland and this City jointly. The prepa
rations were most elaborately made and
the evening passed most auspiciously.
Those who had the affair in charge were:
. Floor directorâ G. P. Grondona; assist
ant, A. Fodera.
Reception committeeâ D. G. Caglieri
honorary president; G. B. Carapodonico'
president; G. Flamini. vice-president- G
Tacconi, G. Valvo, O. Menesiri, E. Dellara.
Door committeeâ G. Grondona, L. "Para
vagna, L. Simi, A. L. Bacigalupi, A. Fod
era, A. Allegrini.
Prince Luigi of Savoy attended the
Bush-street last night to witness the per
formance of "Stenterello," an old-time
Italian comedy.
It was presented by a company of ama
teurs under the direction of A. Barli, and
from the manner in which it was received
by the large audience the actors and act
resses acted their parts well.
The Prince occupied one of the stage
boxes in company with Commander Ales
satidro Bertolini and Lieutenant Figerio of
the warship Cristoforo Colombo and Dr. J.
Calegaris. Over the box in ; which the
guest of the evening sat hung the stars
and stripes, while over the opposite box
hung the Italian flag. In another of the
boxes sat Dr. W. Vanazo, Dr. Barsotti P
Michi'.etti and 0. S. Poizzini of San Jose,
proprietor of the Messagero. The auditor
ium was filled with representatives of the
Italian colony, while the gallery was filled
with lesser light.
When the Prince entered the theater
and appeared in the box to which he was
conducted he was greeted with vivas, and
this compliment he acknowledged with a
smile and bow.
Cut a Barkeeper.
John Kelly cut James Clark, a barkeeper em
ployed at 606 Howard, street, across the face
with a knife yesterday morning about 3 o'clock.
The wound was a nasty one, but not sellout
It resulted from Kelly's resenting ; the fact
that Clark evidently did not want him in the
saloon. â¢ Kelly was promptly arrested by Offi
cer Tuite and charged with an assault to
murder.

General Gathering of the League
of the Cross at St. Mary's
Cathedral.
SERMON BY. THE ARCHBISHOP.
** - -
Evils of Intemperance Graphically De
picted and the Work of the
League Extolled.
and fZZ re , hundreds of proud parents
end friends of the young members of the
League of the Cross unable to gain en
trance to St. Mary's Cathedral yesterday
afternoon. The occasion was 'the first
general renewal of the pledge by the mem
bers of the league. This organization has
a total membership of about 7000 in the
City, and the entire body of the church
was reserved yesterday for the members.
he galleries sufficed to hold only a small
quota of the vast number who desired ad
mittance.
The seats in the central portion of the
church were reserved for the cadets, who
made a fine showing as, 400 strong, with
natty uniforms and clanking swords they
marched down the aisles to their places.
Colonel \\ am C. Maloney had charge of
?n?Â« U ; n l lÂ°. Im division Â» which was divided
into eight companies.
I-SIS?, 1 ; 9'? y . a Â°- spiritual director of the
league, led in th - prayer for the church
and cml authorities, and the prayer of
consecration. After a hymn by the con
gregation Archbishop Riordan ascended
the pulpit. He said in part:
"My dear members of the League of the
urossi My far st words this afternoon are
words of thanks to your spiritual director
and to the executive . council for their
heroic labors which have brought about
this magnificent meeting this afternoon,
it is a great consolation to me to feel that
we have been able to gather together so
many thousands of our young men to save
them from the temptations of this great
city. So much of our work to do good
seems to go for nothing that it is encour
aging to see such great accomplishments
on the part of your officials.
"Now what is the object of your organi
sation? It is to taKe you when you are
young and train you in the habits of tem
perance and sobriety, so that when you
are grown you will be so in the habit of
abstaining from those things which are
evil that there will be but little danger of
your being led astray.
"If you read the four Gospels you will
see that our dear Savior was particularly
fond of children. On one occasion, when
the apostles would have driven them away,
he said: 'Suffer little children to come unto
me, for of such as these is the Kingdom of
Heaven.' You who have come by bap
tism into the family of Christ, how much
dearer are you to him than those who lived
under the old religious dispensation. You
are the favored ones of the church and he
takes you in your tender childhood, work
ing upon you in the Lope that its effect
will remain when you Lave attained man
hood.
"The influences which will be brought to
bear upon yon, unfortunately, are not all
for good. Boys are brought day after day
into contact with victims'of intemperance.
The saloon stands always with an open
door and the boys, unless they are careful,
will become victims of the baneful habit.
If we are only careful when we are young
to contract good habits, there will be no
room for evil ones. Drunkenness does not
come all at once. It comes sometimes
very slowly, hut when it does come it is*
very hard to get rid of. Drunkards rind at
j^st that the evil one has wound around
them a chain as strong as iron. Unless
we are careful the light of virtue little by
little goes out from the soul and darkness
is within.
"You do not realize as well as we do the
importance of this work. You are not
brought in contact day by day with in
temperance as we are, but if you remain
true to your pledge you will thank God
that you have been sober and temperate
men and boy?. ~8!P"
"I have never known a man yet when he
came to die regret that he had taken a
pledge and kept it. How many men when
they reach that solemn point where they
look back over their past life bitterly re
pent the years wasted in drunkenness. It
is a great sin against God's law. It de
prives us of our reason. It leads to other
sins too numerous to mention. In tem
perate homes there is peace and joy.
"Many people ask why all this" parade
in order to make people temperate? We
answer, let us do our work in our own
way. If we have saved to temperance a
dozen boys who otherwise would have
filled drunkards' graves we have done a
noble work and our efforts have been rich
ly rewarded.
"If we are good at all we owe it to God's
grace. So, my boys, each day when you
say your prayers, ask God for grace to
keep your, pledge. Ask it every day, for
you need grace every day."
At the conclusion of the sermon the
Archbishop pronounced the pledge of the
League of the Cross, and tne members,
holding up their right hands, repeated it
after him. The service closed "with a
solemn benediction.
Fathers Yorke and Mulligan acted as
chaplains to the Archbishop, and Fathers
McGinty, O'Mahoney, P. Scanlan and
Clark, C. S. P., also occupied seats on the
altar. The choir, which consisted of
voting men, was under the direction of;
Rev. Jerome B. Hannigan.
MARINE JOLLIFICATION.
The Boys of Division 2 of the Naval
Battalion Entertain Their
Friends.
In the days between drills and target
shoots division 2 of the Naval Battalion
planned a jinks, and Saturday night the
event came oft. It was as great a success
as the efforts of the boys deserved, and
certainly far beyond the expectations of
those who were invited. .
The carpet was taken from the parlor
floor and that and the floor of the assem
bly-room were well sanded. At one end
of the assembly-room a stage bad been
erected with electric footlights and other
necessary accessories, and the officers' and
petty officers' rooms were set aside for the
"talent," professional and otherwise.
Of "talent" there was a plenty. There
were ladies who sang and danced; there
were men who cracked jokes and "made
up" and sang songs in which the audience
could join. Frank Cereni, the champion
feather-weight of the Reliance. Club,
boxed with his friend. Dr. McCarthy, the
dentist De Lasaux, Emanuel and Mills,
three of toe men from the division, ex
posed interesting bits of Naval Battalion
history and sang verses, the theme of
which was the wees of the boys at the Oak
land camp. John McCullough recited,
Frank (rum told stories, and others did
various turns until nearly 12 o'clock;
Refreshments in the way of beer, sand
wiches, frankfurters and pipes were gener
ously handed round, and under tbeir joy
ous influence the boys started dancing as
soon as the programme had ended. The
affair was under the management of an en
tertainment committee, â¢ composed of
Harry de Lasaux, Joe Emanuel, W. A.
Peterson, Russell Reed and J. S. Mills.
The music was furnishea by boys from the
division.

THE POWER OF YOUTH.
The Dille Lectures to ' Young Men at
the Y. -M. C. A. Building.
The Rev. Dr. Dille delivered a lecture
yesterday afternoon to the young men at
the Y. M. C. A. building.
He spoke from the text St. Mark x:l7â
those verses which Jesus speaks to the
affluent young man who had lived a stain
less life and who desired to come into the
life eternal.
"Jesus looked upon the young man and
loved 'him because be was young. There
is a charm about youth, its grace, its
purity, and its unspent energies.
"Jesus called his disciples when they
wore young men. All were under thirty.
There was a profound reason in this. It
was the work of Christ to entirely reform
and renovate society. This could only be
done by the fresh and strong young heart
and minds. .
- "A man who has not fixed his career by
the time he is 25 stands little chance of
making something of himself, and a man
who is not converted before he is 30 will
spend the remainder of his days. in dark
ness."-
"Happy is the man who can make a re
cording angel of bis mother. We must
have tiie best type of man before we can
have the best type of Christian. There is
a knowledge that s comes from God and
that shows, the way to ; perfect manhood
and Christianity; but how many.there are
who care nothing lor this knowledge and
say unto the ; Lord, 'Depart from me; I
care not to learn of thy ways.' -Turn to
the Lord and you will receive a life that is
abundant and eternal."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17. 1896.
GREAT LIBRETTIST'S WIFE
Mrs. Harry B. Smith Talks of
Her Husband's Methods
and Workshop.
MIGHT LIVE DOWN ROBIN HOOD.
Author of " Rob Roy," "The Fencing-
Master" and "Wizard of the
Nile"â A Bibliomaniac.
Mrs. Harry B. Smith, the charming
young wife of the prince of American
librettists, is in the City, and may soon be j
joined by her gifted husband.
Mrs. Smith arrived yesterday, accom- j
panied by their three-year-old sou, Master !
Sidney Reed Smith, and will be the guest j
of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. William Reed,
at 1002 Bush street, for four weeks. She I
is a dark-eyed blonde, with vivacious man- !
ncr, tempered with a.dignity that sits well !
upon her, a fine conversationalist and a j
critic of no little merit. Mr. Smith met j
her in Chicago, and there they spent the i
HARRY B. SMITH, PRINCE OF AMERICAN LIBRETTISTS.
earlier years of their married life. Later
they removed to New York, and are es
teemed members of a coterie of the nobility
of Gotham's Bohemia.
; The wife of the author of "Robin Hood"
makes no secret of her pride in her hus
band's deserved success. She has a most
intelligent comprehension of the aims and
scope of his work, yet modestly disclaims
any credit for aid in the way of sugges
tions or inspiration. â \?-X;
"My husband wrote the libretto of
â¢Robin Hood' in less than four weeks,"
she said. "Indeed, that is quite charac
teristic of him. He 'dashes off' every
thing. He never breaks an engagement
with a publisher. If he promised to finish
a libretto by to-morrow nigh:, he would
do so.
"He is much given to underestimating
the literary value of his productions. He
was very despondent when he witnessed
the first dress rehearsal of "Robin Hood."
I think it was at the Columbia Theater,
Chicago. I remember it was badly put on,
and that Mr. Smith's artistic sense was
offended by" the fact that chorus girls
wore satin corsets instead of bodices. The
costumer assured him that the strings and
other objectionable paraphernalia would
be covered by flowers, but he was not sat
isfied. As we rode home he sighed and
said. 'Well, perhaps I can live it down.*
To this day he says he cannot understand
why audiences enjoy "Robin Hood."
"His favorite opera? Tne one he is
working on, always. When he finishes it
his interest in it practically end 3, I have
known him to leave before the close of the
first performance of his new opera.
"He is under contract with Mr. de
Koven for five years and their productions
will be put on at the Herald-square The
ater, New York, before being sent out.
That playhouse is to be known in the fu
ture as the Smith and De Koven Theater.
Mr. Smith's lyric and dramatic work will
be confined to the contract with Mr. de
Koven except as to adaptations and prior
contracts.
"He is engaged just now on an adaotation
from the French for Francis Wilson, the
j comedian, so popular in the East. It
| was he who made 'Erminie' famous. The
music is by Lubig Englander, a composer
who, I think, can scarcely be excelled.
Indeed, Mr. , Smith is at work on two
operas for Mr. Wilson. One is 'The Caliph. '
" 'Robin Hood' is very popular here, I
understand. Its successor, 'Rob Roy,' ran
for eight months in New York. It is of
the romantic class of opera. 'The Wizard
ofthe Nile,' which is more of a comedy,
has just closed a successful season at the
| Herald square Theater. It had been run
j ning since the second week of October.
Dorothy Morton made a captivating Cleo
patra."
Mrs. Smith describes her husband's
workshop with charming naivete.
"The whole house might be called his
workshop," she said laughingly. "His
library occupies the front portion of the
house, his 'den' the rear and the walls of
the intermediate rooms are practically
lined with books. Think of a dining-room
with books along two sides. Such a one is
ours. The walls of. the den are red. The
pictures, I tell him, are more interesting
than picturesque. There are queer old
prints, for instance, of the Drury Lane
Theater and autograph photographs
galore. There are books, of course, almost
innumerable, and a piano, a fireplace and
the desK which is hi 3 work table."
"His recreation? In books. â¢
"I fear his pleasures and; his toil lie in
too nearly parallel lines. He is a veritable
bibliomaniac. He ; is still fond of news
paper work, a fact which is gratifying to
me, for it tends ' to draw him away from
the books to which he is too. devoted for
his physical well-being.
"He thinks of the time when he will no
longer write operas, but plays, and then
when he will not write plays but books,
finally he will no longer write, but read. I
told you he was a bibliomaniac." :
; The popular librettist commenced his
literary career as a newspaper man. He
has been â¢ connected with' the Tribune-
Herald and other Chicago papers, chiefly
as musical and diamatic critic, although
he was a notable interviewer. He has
supported himself and others by his pen
since he was 17.' The Chicago fire de
stroyed tho wealth of his family and; he
became its mainstay. '
/:..'. He numbered among his closest friends
the late Eugene Field. The tie between
the two was of much the I same - nature : as
that that bound Damon and Pythias.
The latest of Mr. Smith's , productions,
except those dramatized, is the collection
of poems entitled "Lyrics and Sonnets,"
which is 'â¢ dedicated to j the memory of bis
sister, Gertrude Sidney Smith. He i
preparing a volume of society; verse that
will be published next winter.
The following stanza in ''A Book-lover's
Vision," one of the lyrics, Mrs. Smith
pronounces characteristic of her husband's
ruling passion for books:
But I've a sort of heaven In mind
That's of a very different kind ,
The which I hope some day to find

BRIGHAM YOUNG'S DAUGHTERS.
Mormon Prophet's Offspring Among the
Singers to Visit the Coast.
All arrangements have been completed
for three concerts by the Mormon Taber
nacle choir in this City early in April.
The representation it will send to the
coast consists of fifty trebles, forty altos,
forty tenors and forty-five bassos. There
will be ten vocal soloists, one organist and
the director, Professor Evan. Stephens,
making a grand total of 192. There will
be four stringed instruments for accom
paniment. There are 175 other singers in
the famous choir, but these remain at
home to furnish music for the tabernacle.
Several of Brigham Younc's daughters
will be among the singers. The Mormon
prophet was a great musical organizer, and
many of the members of his family are
the possessors of decidedly musical talent.
The choir competed with the choirs of
the world at Chicago in 1893, and was
awarded a cash prize of $1000 by the
World's Fair judges of music. The Mor
mon singers won the cash prize of $500 at
the greatest Eisteddfod ever held in Amer
ica, that of October last in Salt LaKe, and
they expect to enter the lists at the Eis
teddfod to be held in Denver next Septem

THE PENITENTIAL SEASON
Father Wyman Preaches an Ap
propriate Sermon at St.
Mary's Church.
Says the Spiritual Life Withers and
Dies Unless Renewed From
Time to Time.
Rev. Father Wyman preached a special
sermon relative to the approaching season
of Lent at St. Mary's Church on California
street yesterday morning. The text was:
"Love not the world, nor the things that
are in the world. If any man love the
world, the love of the Father is not in
him"â First St. John ii:s. Father Wy
man said
"Great as have been the evils which
Christians have suffered from persecution,
those which have been inflicted upon them
by what St. John calls the world are
greater. The torch, the sword, the teeth
of wild beasts could not overcome many
who have been conquered by pride, avarice
and pleasure. The former are sharp,
quick and decisive; the latter like the cor
roding rust, the decaying wood, the evap
orating mists, are slow, but are not less
effective on this account. We are so mixed
up with the world and so affected by its
influences that it is only by great effort
and watchfulness that **c can es
cape its blighting tendencies. Knowing
this the church, following the example"
of her founder and guided by the Holy
Spirit, has appointed forty days out of
every 365 or 366 in the year" to repair the
ravages made by sin upon our souls. Just
as every material work of man, if left to
itself, decays and crumbles to pieces so
the spiritual life,; unless renewed from
time to time, becomes dead.
"The history of tbe people cf God from
the beginning of the world, it seems to
me, reveals tbe fact that inconstancy hag
always been the great obstacle to spiritual
advancement. Divine impressions are like
the prints just taken from the photogra
pher's negative. If exposed for only a
short time to the sunlight they become
dim and gradually are effaced. God woo
is the giver of light to our understand
ings, has also provided moans by which
with faithful co-operation on our part'
these impressions may be retained. - -â¢'. '
"Besides constantly thinking on these
truths, and thereby keeping them vividly
before our minds, we ; must also - take
measures to prevent outside influences
from marring them. We keep pride away
by voluntarily humbling ourselves- we
destroy the passion of. avarice by generous
almsgiving; we restrain our inordinate
love of pleasure by bodily mortification
This is the object of the "holy and peni
tential season in which we are soon to
enter."

REALTY MARKET REVIEW.
Comments Upon the Torrens Land
Title System by J. J.
Dwyer.
REVIEW OF THE RECORDS.
Architectural Tastes as Expressed by
. Public and Private Build
ings.
i
Architectural aspect is beginning to as
sume a most important place in determin
ing real estate values. Owners are taking
vast interest in the cleverness and ability
I of architects. - The merit of a plan and the
I dignity and simplicity of the composition
I of an elevation receives distinguished con
sideration in this day and generation.
Apropos of the new municipal building
to be erected upon the site of the old City
Hall, attention is directed to that quarter
Of the City once more. Time was when it
was the City and Market street was a se
ries of sandhills. During the period of its
original prosperity there were erected
within its precincts many buildings of
good architectural design. Some few, the
old Globe Hotel for example, have not
been surpassed as far as correct principles
of architectural composition are con
cerned, by even our newest and latest
buildings uptown.
It is a curious and an amazing study to
trace the development of popular taste, as
expressed by public and private buildings
erected at different periods in the progress
of the improvement of the State.
The earliest efforts were, of course, the
Old Missions. Their charm rests entirely
in the fact that their builders recognized
the value of simplicity and were influenced,
as far as detail was concerned, by the Mex
ican and Spanish classic renaissance.
Next came the buildings of the pioneer
daysâ mostly well designed and undoubt
edly owing their origin to the influence of
French renaissance. Then came the bo
nanza days, when pure and simple lines
fell into disrepute and vulgarity reigned
supreme. . - ;/ ; v - Â£
This phase was quickly followed by the
bay-window. Queen Anne, Eastlake, old
colonial, up-to-date nonsense. All this ill
considered, hastily constructed and itrno
rantly designed work has had its effect
upon real estate values. Thoughtless peo
ple who have blindly copied, and imitated
the grotesque mistakes of others are suf
fering the consequences. It is unparalleled
in the history of the world that a fad
should influence building to the detriment
of architecture to the extent that it' has in
this country. Within the last twenty
years a succession of fads nave swept over
the country, leaving grotesque ruin and
absurd desolation in their wake. The Cen
tennial Exhibition of 1876 began the craze
and it remained for the World's Fair of
1893 to break its back.
At last, however, it is becoming the
fashion to consider 'architecture- as some
thing more than a fad. However, for sev
eral years to come we must expect to see
occasional survivals of the "ignorant age."
It will die hard, because it brought into
existence >an army of imitative- builders
ana speculative owners. Many of them
take their ignorance seriously, so it is nat
ural to expect them to give way stubbornly.
As for converting them, that, is a matter of
education, and it is hard to teach an old
dog new tricks. '
THE TORRENS LAND-TRANSFER SYSTEM.
.7. J. Dwyer, an attorney of this City who
has Riven the subject of land titles a great
deal of study, in the following communi
cation on the Torrens land-title system,
takes issue somewhat with Warren Greg
ory, whose able article upon that system
as adopted in Cook County, 111., appeared
a week ago in The Call in the real estate
review:
The principles of the Torrens system may he
Eummed up as follows:
In the first place, a judicial examination and
determination of the present status of a title.
Secondly, the registration of that title in the
suitable books in a public hail of records.
Thirdly, the transfer from hand to hand of
such registered titles under the supervision of
an officer whose duty It would be at the time of
each transfer to determine conclusively UDon
the validity of all questions involved.
This system is some forty years old In the
place where it was devised, South Australia.
its working features are very little known in
America, except by a few specialists who have
investigated the matter; and I see by compe
tent authority that even in Australia the sys
tem has not yet come into general use.
1 have seen the statement made by compe
tent authority in a report that was "made by
the House of Commons in England by a com
mittee that was appointed to investigate the
particular workings of this system in Aus
tralia "that the anticipations which were
formed when the act was passed of benefit
that would likely accrue from its general
adoption have In no sense been realized; and
running through a period of thirteen months
out of ten or fifteen hundred transfers only
seven, or a little more than one in two months,
were made under the act, and the act might
therefore be considered a dead letter."
The system has never been tried yet in any
American State so far as I am aware, although
jit has been introduced in several of the Legis
atures of different States. The system was
d opted in Cook County, 111., last year and of
r 1 ourse any one interested in the workings of
he same will watch its operation with great
Attention.
I do not mean to say that there is no virtue
in the system, as adopted in that county, but I
do consider that there are various restrictions
imposed by. the National and State constitu
tions.. If any statutory legislation in the
United States should adopt' the Australian
statute as Torrens devised it, it would bo de
clared unconstitutional by our courts, and in
order to make it a working system here it
would therefore be necessary to alter some of
the fundamental principles of our constitu
tional law. ...'â¢â¢â .<.
Under the Torrens system, when a title is
once registered it passes to a purchaser by en
try on the proper register, and the act of
the Registrar is regarded as conclusive
against the claims of all third parties; I
but such ~a system would not he ope
rated here for the reason that the proceedings
would be had without our jurisdiction, which
provides that a man should not be deprived of
his property without due process of law; and it
is mv opinion that if you want to avoid that
constitutional violation, it must oe done,
either by changing fundamentally the consti
tutional system of the United States, or else
there must be virtually a lawsuit over any
transfer of property under this system, which
would make it so expensive that it would
break down of its own weight.
The statute proposed, based upon the Tor
rens system, for enactment by the last session
of the California Legislature would practically
bring about exactly that state of affairs, viz., a
lawsuit in any transfer of property under the
Torrens system, which, of course, would reduce
the thing to an absurdity.
There is one feature of "the Torrens act which
commends itself to everybody instantly, and
that is that, it . presents certain methods of
giving a title what you might call a start, be
hind which :it -would otherwise be neces
sary to go in examining the validity of the
title. - - 'â¢.
In this City, for example, for almost every
piece of a property, searchers must run the title
back to the beginning- of the American occupa
tion. That, of course, seems a very long time,
but when compared to what searchers must do
in other States where titles are very much
older, it is- quite- a short â  periodâ only about
forty-five years â but in this City it is a very
great expense, especially with small lots, to
run the. title back to 1849. â¢ .
- Very frequently abstracts of a-twenty-five
foot lot worth about $1000 or $1500 will cost
from $30 to $30. Add to this a lawyer's fee for i
passing upon the title and it brings the ex- :
pense up to from $50 to $70, which of course
is a very.great burden upon the small prop
erty-owner, and if some means could be de
vised to do away with a very elaborate abstract
of title, and save the necessity of going back to
the beginning of the title. it would be a very '
good thing, for in that event It would cheapen
and facilitate the searching of titles, and the
Torrens â¢ system does this. It provides for a '
judicial- investigation into the state of anr
title. : It provides for . a judicial investigation j
upon the application of body .who desires
to .bring his property under the act, in which <
notice is given to everybody who claims an in
terest in the property, and the judgment of the
court is then regarded as final and conclusive
on all the world, and from that time on every- !
body investigating the title need not go fur
ther back than the judgment itself. ,"
This is an admirable thing, but it is not an i
Australian invention. It has been an Ameri
can law for 100 years. It is a well-known
principle of the American law that in an
action of partition on real property, all claim
ants to the property, known or unknown, can
be joined as parties to the suit, and the judg
ment of the Court is conclusive as to title in
all respects, both as to known claimants and
unknown claimants, and it is just as valid a
judgment, and just as good a start for a title as
anything proposed by any of the American
lawyers based upon the Torrens system. This
seems to have occupied the attention of most
of the advocates of the Torrens system, who
seem to regard the Australian idea of giving a
judicial start as a novel invention.
If a law were passed by our Legislature con
taining that language in terras that would
make it plain to the people that the object of
the law was to determine how the title of any
particular property stands at the present mo
ment, and that from that time on the title be
considered as judicially final and conclu
sively determined, all the benefits of the Tor
rens system that I think are applicable to our
system would be operated. It can be done now
in partition proceedings, but as that is not
looked upon generally as a means of giving
validity to titles, it would tend to make the
system intelligible. Possibly a law could be
passed in terms making it plain to the people
that an action in the matter of partition pro
cedure should be a means of establishing the
title of any piece of property so that it would
not be necessary from that time on to go be
hind the judgment in searching records. Then
this could be done in an ordinary judicial pro
ceeding. *
The title of a lot on the corner of Market and
Montgomery streets could be determined to
day, and the judgment would be conclusive
on all the world, and it would not be necessary
to go behind that judgment in order to find
out what adverse claims there might be if one
snould want to buy this property; and further
more, Instead of calling it partition proceed
ings, if we had a law that would provide for
"establishing proceedings for title," or some
such thing as that, it would do away with four
filths of the labor and cost of searching titles.
If tbatoneprincipleof establishing judicially
how the title stands at any particular time
found embodiment in our laws we would have
more than half the virtues of tne Torrens sy s- I
tern as practiced in Australia, and all the vir
tue that I think can be derived from it.
The fault with the Torrens system in America
is that we have written constitutions that pre
vent its workings. The Federal character of
our Government offers this obstacle to the full
operation of the system. If the constitution of
the State were amended so as to permit it to be
put into operation here, nevertheless the title
could not be held conclusively valid as against
any lien that might be imposed by the Federal
system of taxation. To illustrate: Under the
Torrens system if a piece ol property is regis
tered in the name of Mr. Smith and a judgment |
is obtained against him, and the Sheriff should
sell out the property of another Mr. .Smith,
making a mistake as to the identity of the
judgment debtor, the title of the purchaser
under the Torrens system would be good, even
though the Sheriff levied upon the property of
the wrong Mr. Smith. That is the state of "the
law in Australia, and in order to compensate
all possible errors of that kind an insurance or
indemnity fund is provided by the act, and if
a man, unfortunately, should have his prop.
erty sold over his head by the mistake of min
isterial officers in that way, his only recourse
would be out of this indemnity fund. Of
course, such a procedure as that is absolutely-
Impossible in the United States. It is against
all constitutions, State and Federal, to take a
man's property away without due process of
law, and how they are going to get around this
objection 1 do not see.
If the law were compulsory, it would at
least have the benefit of bringing about
a' uniform system of land transfer; but even
its most ardent advocates are ' agreed
that it is absolutely useless to
try to make the law compulsory.
They have not done it yet in Australia, and as
I understand it, neither have they done it un
der the Cook County lav/. Certainly, if any
system was to be such as to make the records
all uniform, its advantages ought to be so per
ceptible and so demonstrative that we could
afford to adopt it as a compulsory law. In
other words.it is my opinion that we do not
know enough about this system to try it, and
it is purely wisdom of law to let some other
community try it. I
There is a greater need of a change of
the law of laud transfer in the older
settled communities than we have in
the West, where our titles only run
back about forty or fifty years. Of course, in
older communities, where they run back for
100 years, it is very necessary, but here, where
the title runs hack to United States patents, it
is only from fifteen to twenty years, and so the
abstracts are very brief and very cheap. It is
true, in larger cities, where there : has been
much registration of large property, the book
of abstracts is correspondingly increased, be
cause it is necessary to set forth all the pro-'
ceedings and litigation in insolvency and other
court proceedings, and it makes a very bulky
book and a very expensive cne, but under the
Torrens system it is my opinion that the ab
stract would be quite as expensive as it is un
der the present system. . --â - --.-.
I have examined several of the statutes based
upon the Torrens system and I do not think
that its adoption would tend to lessen the ex
pense or the simplification of abstracts because
1 do not see how it is ever possible under the
method to save the necessity of setting up
probate proceedings, insolvency proceedings,
and in short all court proceedings affecting
the title. It is a very simple matter, in the
opinion of people who have had no experience'
in transferring property, because they
only hear of it as a mere matter of deeds.
The expense and the difficulty of passing on
titles arise from the fact that there 13 so much
litigation necessaryâ in the transfer
of titles, both because of judicial sales and
because of probate and insolvency proceed
ings and such things; and no system that
human wit can devise, so far as I can see, will
do away with the necessity of a lawyer at some
stage of the proceedings. There is a notion
prevalent in some quarters that the Torrens
system if established in this State would so
make abstracts that a buyer and a seller could
go to the record office and transfer the property
without lawyers.
Well, If it should be adopted we would get into
trouble that would be found more expensive to
get out of than the present cost of passing on
titles. Perhaps no community affords a better
illustration of the possibility of giving a fair
start to titles than our own, because particu
larly now, for outside land titles in San Fran
cisco, people are satisfied to rest upon the City
deed. Very few searches now are made back
of the City deed, and if a judicial procedure
could be relied on as a record, that would give
a start to a title now, or any time in the future.
In other words, there is plenty of force and
virtue in our system as it stands to-day, with a
little remodeling to do away with most of the
costly and tedious and laborious work of
making abstracts.

MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS. s
Mayor Sutro has given orders to 0. F.
yon Rhein & Co. to put two blocks in the
vicinity of the Cliff House up for auction.
A large force of men will be put to work in
a few days to prepare the property for the
sale. The terms to be offered will be easy
and the sale peremptory. The date of the
auction has been fixed for Thursday,
March 5.
Headquarters were opened a few days
ago in the Mills Building for Dingley's
Addition adjoining the townsite of
Lemoore, Kings County. The plan of sale
adopted is one of the most novel yet pro
posed in connection with the offer of any
subdivision property in California. It is
proposed by the promoters to distribute
over a $1000 in prizes. The town of
Lemoore is reported to be very prosperous
and it is predicted that some day it will be
one of the leading cities of the San Joaquin
Valley. Its prospects are undoubtedly as
good as those of Fresno were a few years
ago and with the aid of a few enterprising
men may possibly > grow equally as fast,
When one remembers that Chicago was
offered for a pair of mules less than three
score years ago, he may reasonably look
for surprising developments in many cj
our coast cities now comparatively small
and unknown.
Baldwin & Hammond report the sale ol
a f 1500 cottage, the past week, to Henry J,
Collim#in the Castro-street addition. In
this tract a number of neat residences we re:
recently completed, and the prospects are
good for considerable activity this season.
Bovee, Toy & Sontag have fitted up a
splendid auction-room in the rear of their

the Consolation.
The largest crowd that ever assembled
at Ocean View Coursing Park witnessed
the running yesterday and saw races that
brought forth the utmost enthusiasm.
Eight pairs of dogs ran undecided courses
before the Hag went up, and the excellence
of the sport tended to make the betting
heavier than ever before in the history o!
the resort.
The run between Flashlight and Snow
bird was pronounced by all to be a clinker,
the points being equal in a race twice
across the field, until the kill gave Flash
light the advantage ami the Bag.
Both the regular and consolation stakes
were divided, the grueling courses pre
vious to the finish making the owners of
the dogs unwilling to put them to further
exertions. Following is the result of the
rundown in the regular stake:

JOE GLICKSMAX.
PORTLAND, Oregon, Feb. 11.
I called upon the head, of "the Gleudova
Wine Co. to learn the state of the wine
trade and incidentally I beard the praise
of California, and the great" Californian
remedy, Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. Mr.
Glicksman deals in Californian wines and,
takes an interest in Californian products.
He has just recovered from a bilious fever.
The attack lasted more than a week. Dur-
ing his sickness he used nothing but Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla and now he is
sounding the praise of this great remedy.
He told me that Joy's Vegetable Sarsapa-
rilla was recommended to him by a lady
who had t suffered from constipation and
kidney trouble.
Certainly it is pleasant to bear a good
word of one's native State and to come in
contact with so many people who praise
the products of California. It would be no
difficult matter to collect here one thou-
sand testimonials for Joy's Vegetable Sar-
saparilla. No one tries to substitute Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla. I have tried every
druggist and each one was only too glad
to wrap up a bottle for me. How different
it is in some parts of San Francisco. You
need an ax and the price to get Joy's Veg-
etable Sarsaparilla.

at station indlca.e maximum temperature for the
J.fln'fiii Â£** underneath It. if any. the amount of
ralmall, of mclt *' snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure- iso
therms or dotted linos, equal temperature. The
word -high" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers 10 low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains
eJfX'Z Â«-L S" a ',5[ flr,,t Â»PPÂ«* on the Washington
Snn iÂ«J hru U L P refÂ»'re is high in the interior
and low along J he coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "'"' Is inclosed with Isobars of
Sml Â«M Ui vatu. IJ*\., a,n south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in ihe vicinitvof Idaho, and
the pressure failing to the California coast, warmer
weather may he expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
rill produce an opposite result.

AWFUL DEATH
AT BERKELEY.
_
Young Girl Crushed Under
the Wheels of a
Local Train.
WAS KILLED INSTANTLY.
The Wheels Passed Over Her
Neck and Severed the Head )
From the Body.
THERE WAS BUT ONE WITNESS.
Little May Quill the Victimâ The
Train Went on to the Next Sta
tionâWho Is to Blame ?
BERKFLEY, Cal., Feb. 16.â May Quill,
a girl of 13 years, who lives with Mrs.
Michael J. Powell at the corner of Matee
avenue and Allsfcon way, Berkeley, was
instantly killed by the 7 o'clock" south
bound local train this evening while at
tempting to alight from it near Dwight
way station. The wheels passed over her
head, completely severing it from her
body and crushing it beyond all descrip
tion. No other injuries to her body were
sustained save a few bruises. Her cloth
ing was not even tattered.
There were no eye-witnesses to the tragic
death, so far as can be ascertained save
Sadie Miller, a young girl who also lives
with Mrs. Powell, and who was in company
with the unfortunate girl when the acci
dent took place.
Some friends of Mrs. Powell had come
over from San Francisco to spend the day
in Berkeley, and when they were about to
leave May Quill and Sadie Miller asked if
they could accompany the callers to the
locaL Leave was granted, and as they de
parted for the train Mrs. Powell admon
ished them to take care and return home
before it got too dark. With a fond em
brace she bid farewell to the children as
they went tripping merrily up the street
toward Berkeley station. This was the
last she heard of them, until the news of
May's death came to her. Instead of re
turning at once, the two girls boarded the
train and rede to Dwight way. It was
when they were attempting to alight that
the accident took place.
Sadie states that she saw May when she
was killed. On account of her extreme
excitement Miss Miller seemed unable to
givea clear statement as to how it occurred.
She says that she and May had ridden to
Dwicht way and that she herself got off all
right. So great was her confusion that
she could not state whether May had
made any attempt to alight before the
train started or whether she herself got off
while the train was at a standstill or was
moving. About ail she could say was "I '
pot off all right, but-poor May didn't." |
Conductor Chris Luttrell, who wastlin
harge of the train at the time of the acci
dent, said: -
"I knew nothing of the accident until
we had nearly reached Ashby. avenue, the
next station beyond Dwight way, when a
boy came running through the car and
told me that some one was injured. I
stopped the train and told the engineer to
back up until we were within seventy-five
or eighty feet of where the body lay. 1
left the brakeman there in charge of the
remains and then went on to the mole.
The boy who told me of the accident said
that the girl who was killed was standing
on the lower .step of the car when the
train started, and remained there until
well under way. The boy said that he
asked her why she did not get off, to which
she responded, 'I don have to.' I saw :
the girl standing in the train talking to j
her friends during our run from Berkeley
station to DwightTway, but had no knowl- i
edge of whether she got off until after the ;
occurrence of the accident.
"As to the report that the train was late
and That we did not stop at Dwight way
the usual length of time, I will state that
that there is no truth in it. I can swear
that at least seventy-five or eighty people
got on at that station, and every one had
ample time to get on or off. The crowd
wp.s unusually large, and special precau
tion was taken on that account. I was
standing on one side of the train and the
brakeman on the other when the engineer
was signaled togo ahead. That every one
bad ample time 1 am positively certain."
Brakeman Aldrich, who was left in
charge of the body after the train had
backed up, stated that he had no knowl
edge of how the accident took place, and
that so far as he was able to learn from
what people said, it was purely accidental
and due to carelessness, on the part of the
girl.
One statement is to the effect that the
dead girl had left a package on tbe train
and was returning to get it when the train
s'artcd and in her effort to jump off was
thrown beneath the wheels.
â¢ This report is not credited, however, as
the package alluded to has not been found.
There are several conflicting statements
with regard to the case. ' Some say that
the train did not stop long enough to ad
mit of every one setting off, while others
state that ample time was given. It is the
general supposition that the girl was at
tempting to see how long she could stay
on the moving train and yet get off sately.
The point where the accident occurred
was about half-way between Blake and
Parker streets, or about 500 feet from
Dwightway Station. The roadbed is per
fectly smooth at this point, showing that
the girl must have slipped off the steps or
between the steps of the two cars. A lit
tle farther down the track there is an.era
bankment on either side, which would
have had a tendency to throw her beneath
the wheels had the accident occurred in
that vicinity. The body lay apparently in
the very same position in which it had
fallen, as the clothing was only slightly
disheveled and no limbs were fractured.
There was no scattering of crushed parts
of the head farther than two or three feet,
and her life-blood lay in '-'a pool between
the heavy rails. ' -â¢
The dead girl's father, who Keeps a gro
cery at the corner of Twenty-sixth and
Alabama streets, San Francisco, was at
once notified of the accident, but up till a
late hour to-night had not arrived. Her
mother is not living and she was the only
daughter. She was- living with Mrs. Pow
ell and attending St. Joseph's Convent in
West Berkeley.
She had been living in Berkeley only
since July, and pass' her .thirteenth
birthday last September. - An inquest will
be held over the remains to-morrow morn
ing.

H. Coulter Brinker and Maud Edna
Hall closed long engagements at Moros
co's Grand Opera-house last night. Miss
Hall has played the part of the lovely
heroine, and Mr. Brkiker has been the
manly and magnanimous hero so success
fully that they have won warm aces in
the â¢ hearts of Mr. Morosco's clientele.
Knowing that it was Brinker's last ap
pearance, the audience would not let him
slay dead last night after he was killed in
the second act. . . ' â ; 'â¢;Â£"Â£:. â -"â " : i: .' â¢
. From all over the house came cries for a
speech. The cries became a roar, and the
curtain had to go up. Mr. Brinker made
an effective little farewell talk, though his
usually clear voice could hardly be heard
at first. He was greeted with cheers and
cries of "good-by" and "good luck" as the
curtain fell.|g__aÃ
A similar ovation was tendered Miss
Hall in her last scene. She could respond
only by pretty bows and kisses thrown
from from her finger tips.
STILL DIGGING FOR GOLD
Four Men Have Obtained Per
mission to Prospect
Certain Lands.
The Last Place Worked. Over Is
Near the Jute Mills in
East Oakland.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 16. (
Under an old oak tree near the jute
mills in East Oakland four men have been
digging for more than a- week. They
sank a shaft about four feet square and
twenty feet deep. An old well-digging
derrick was used, to hoist out the earth
after hand labor failed, and the scene
looked like business, as severaljpeople were
attracted to the neighborhood and began
to sink holes for themselves.
For some time there has been a quartet
of men going about the city digging on
unfrequented spots for hidden treasure.
A few weeks ago they were at work in
West Oakland in the yard of a house
where a young Italian was found dead last
Wednesday. A little later they appeared
at the cotton mill at Twenty-third avenue,
but failed to discover anything. Their
last place was at' the base of an old oak
tree near the jute mills. The three elder
men claim that they are from New York,
where they received information leading |
them to believe they would find hidden
fortunes in Oakland. They came out and
secured the assistance of a man in Ala
meda, who pilots them around.
J. H. Macdonald knows something about
the treasure-seeking operations, although
he smiles when asked about the treasure.
The land which the seekers work on is
owned by San Francisco parties and Mr.
Macdonald is agent for the property. For I
a year or more the men have been digging
surreptitiously and at night. In the morn
ing big holes would be found in the earth,
but no diggers could be seen. Twice their
operations were so extensive that large oak
trees were uprooted. A short time ago
one of the men, named Cunningham, came
to Mr. Macdonald and secured permission
to dig, since which time the work has been
prosecuted io the daytime.
The story behind the search for buried
treasure is the old one which has so often
started credulous people forth with their
picks and shovels to make excavations in
ail kinds of places. It is said that the
treasure was the booty of a couple of
pirates, or at least of robbery, and that it
was buried. Afterwards one" of the two
was killed and the other imprisoned, and
while in prison he confided to a cellmate
the story of the gold. It seems probable
that the old pirate story will stimulate
occasional treasure-digging in Oakland for
a score of years to come. ; ,~?

PADEREWSKI AS A TEST.
....
A Chance to Prove If Oakland Is
Is Really a Musical
City.
EDITOR HIGH'S CONUNDRUM.
Politicians Are Now Engaged Playing
Both Ends Against the
Middle.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 16. â  }
This city's musical taste is about to be
tested. Next Saturday night" the great
Pole will give one concert at the Macdon
ough Theater, and, as usual, the admis
sion fee is placed at a figure that will ex
clude all those whose preference for a new
bonnet is greater than that of high-class
.music, and who cannot afford both. Oak
land is proud of passing as a musical town.
She is full of musicians, and ' debuts and
complimentary concerts are more numei
ous than they are across the bay. There
is more professional rivalry, more com
mercial competition and, withal, more
musical organizations than the ordinary
person is aware of. Signor Minetti caused
a great commotion about two years ago by
refusing to play with the Oakland orches
tra. He said some uncomplimentary
thincs and they rankled in the minds of
some, while they were upheld by others.
As in politics, so in music, Oakland is di
vided, and jealousy holds a generous sway.
Musical criticism has degenerated into a
system of complimentary advertising for
the pupils and patrons of the writers, and
has long since been so regarded. A pro
fessor from Chicago came here a few
months ago, gave the school children and
local singers a few lessons in chorus sing
ing, and wound up with one of the grand
est concerts ever heard in Oakland.
He did not meet with much favor by the
professionals and was looked upon by
some of them in the light of a shyster.
But the concert left no doubt as to his
merit, and after he had gone from whence
he came there was a good deal published
about "superficiality" and "unsafe sys
tems." Whether he was a genius or an
ape is still doubtful to some people, while
plenty pronounced him to (be the one, and
as many declared him .to be tne other.
The discrepancy .in judgment represents
the range of musical culture in Oakland.
Now there is a chance to determine
whether music is a fad , here or whether
love for it is deeply grounded. There is
considerable speculation as to the result of
the Paderewski concert. Many predict

failure, others success. - The number of
those who profess to be lovers of music
would fill the Macdonough many times.
Should there be anything less than a
crowded house Oakland will hereafter be
considered a very second-rate town, mu
sically. ,ffV -: V . -
The decision of the Supreme Court pub
lished in this paper a few days ago, which
it is held definitely decides in favor of two
year terms for county officers, has caused
a big flutter in this ultra- political commu
nity. - Office-holders are in a dilemma and
they are on both horns of it. If they ac
knowledge that their four-year aspirations
cannot hold and commence to make a
campaign to succeed themselves it will
greatly add to the vigor with which those
who wish to do the succeeding are making
their fights. On the other hand, if the
office-holders fold their hands in assumed
security and do nothing they may realize
too late that the opportunity for "another
term has gone . by. As no move can.be
made to get the matter before the Su
preme Court on a specific issue before the
time for making nominations the situation
is rendered very complex, and whatever is
done will have to-be done with a rush on
the eve of the election. This being the
case the air is full of the names of candi
dates, and everybody who is accustomed
to make a dollar out of politics is laying
plans. The ten-to-one chance that the
Supreme Court may decide in ; favor of
four-year terms gives a beautiful chance to
the political gamblers to perform the trick
known as "playing both . ends against the
middle," and they are taking hold of it
with an energy would be commend
able and surprising in any other cause.,
Gavin D. High, who took proprietary
right of the historic old battlefield known
as the Oakland Times to-day, was trying
to propound a conundrum last night. ;He
wants to know why a newspaper man
should never be supposed to have a dollar.
"I'm here," said Mr. High to a few
friends who had gathered to welcome him
into the local field of journalism,' "and I've
bought - this paper and : paid for it. Al
ready I've been asked several ; times where
I got the money from to make pur
chase. ; I have said that ." I j have been in
active newspaper work for fifteen years
and that it was . possible j I ; might have
raised a few cents. This seemed to be too
incredible to believe, and only produced a
laugh. ; Then some one asked me if 1 hud
got the necessary coin from my wife, and
others suggested that I had not paid for it.
Now, what business is it of anybody's? I
own this paper, and I paid for it, and I
can't understand why it is that a news
paper man should be supposed to be sys
tematically bankrupt." . â  "
Mr. High is new to Oakland journalism.
When he: has been: here six months he
will be able to answer Shis' own question
and will also be able to explain- the cause
of people's inquisitiveness. . '..-, .: ' ; ' ;
The opposition to Judge Wood > of the
Police Court is the kind that strengthens
him whom it would hurt. 'Since his elec
tion Judge Wood has shown a marked an
tipathy toward dalliance with justice. "He.
is firm almost to obstinacy. â¢ Scores of
cases that should be settled imaffew mm
utes are drawn out by unnecessary.con
tinuances and useless ; demurrers, and
juries are demanded. in cases where the
law leaves it discretionary with the court,
and many other tactics are resorted to
that tend to operate against the dignity of
the court and all concerned. In his deal
ings with Chinese lottery men and liquor
license violators and white gamblers he
has shown a firmness that has surprised
those accustomed to a more plastic bench.
In doing this he has aroused a strong op
position. Being young, he has probably
shown some haste at times, and he has
made some mistakes. The Superior Court
has rectified them, and no "one has suf
fered. When a man is held up- to appro
brium by a few because of his firmness
toward elements antagonistic to the well
being of society be deserves the moral
support of the community. Judge Wood
has it, and if he were to go before the elec
tors to-morrow he would be returned.

SPUR TRACK TAKEN UP.
It Has at Last Been Removed
From the Limits of Golden
Gate Park.
The Work of Grading the Ocean Boule.
yard Is Progressingâ An Ereo
naut's Narrow Escape.
The spur track in Golden Gate Park is a.
thing of the past, and before the close of
the month the rails will be off the great
ocean highway.
During the week a gang of men, acting
under instructions from the Southern Pa
cific, commenced the work of tearing up
the rails and ties in the park, and at the
close of working hours on Saturday had
removed them and a portion of those that
were on the boulevard. -
"The removal of the spur track," said
President Austin of the Park. Commis
sioners yesterday, "has put a stop to the
delivery of street sweepings for the park.
We need all we can get, but we can't get it
now. There is a likelihood that the steam
line of cars on H street will be converted
into an electric line, and if that is done an
I effort will be made to have the sweepings
! hauled over that line after the passenger
traffic is ended for the day.
I "Up to this time no arrangements have
been or are likely to be made for the con
veying iof [ that necessary article to the
park. , I am of the Opinion that in future
contracts for street-sweeping a clause will
be introduced making it obligatory upon
the contractor to deliver the sweepings in
the park."
Last Tuesday' Contractor Buckman
started a gang of men and teams to grade
the ocean boulevard. The work was
started at the northern end near where
the track of the Park and Ocean Railroad
turns north. The grading will be : con
tinued in a southerly direction until the
county line is reached, and before the end
of April there will be ready for the use of
thepnblicone of the finest roads in the
State The railroad company will, it is
expected, move its track to the east a short
distance in order that the boulevard may
be extended in a straight line toward the
north. .
The cars of the three lines having each
a terminus at the beach were crowded to
excess all day long, but during the fore
noon they carried an immease number of
Chinese, men, women and children,- all
in holiday attire. They visited Sutro
Heights, the baths, the beach and many of
â them went to ; the park in the afternoon.
Quito a number of the richer class went
out in carriages and attracted a great deal
of attention.
Adoiph Sutro was the purchaser of the
electric tower in Golden Gate . Park that
was recently pulled down by order of the
Commissioners. -He is having the iron
structure taken to pieces and transported
to the Heights. It is his intention to erect
it at some point not yet decided upon, but
it will probably be put on the Midway
â¢ Plaisance in the vicinity of the tirth
wheel. '.'--.;'â 
During the afternoon the grass on the
hillside northeast ofthe Sutro nursery was
set on fire by some careless individual and
it burned over several acres of ground be
fore it was extinguished by a number of
men in the employ ol the Mayor. The
hothouses were barely saved.
--: In Golden Gate Park there was a very
large number of people and the drives
,were crowded with vehicles and cyclers. ;
The work of cutting the trench for the
tunnel that will be under the main drive
is progressing rapidly. A great deal of
work has also been done recently in the
grand court where the band stand is to be
located. . .. .".'..-; , â _- , .

HAS ACCEPTED THE CALL

At the close of his sermon to-night at
the First Free Baptist Church, Rev. Philip
Rev. Philip Graif, M.A., Who Has Accepted the Pastorate of the First Free Baptist
Church of Oakland.
[Drawn by a '"Call" artist from a photograph.]
Graif, M.A., - announced his ' acceptance
of the recently tendered unanimous call
to the pastorate. ;?-j \V
Rev. Philip Graif has had a long and
practical experience in church work and
is known on both Bides of the continent.
He has also been a renouned promoter of
Christian Endeavor work. Since his con
nection with the First Free Baptist Church
the work has prospered remarkably and
the people showed their attachment for
him some weeks ago by tendering him a
unanimous call.
Several years ago Rev. Philip Graif
founded a young people's society at Lock
port, N. V., shortly after Father Clarke
devised the basis of Christian Endeavor
work. According to the data it is highly
probable that Clarke was among the
first ten ministers to expound the
endeavor movement. In the East he is
well spoken of as a platform and pulpit
speaker, and bis lectures on his travels
abroad have attracted wide attention.
Those who heard his discourse before the
Stanford University or his paper before
the Midwinter Fair Religious Congress on
"Modern Pessimism and Christianity"
pronounced them masterpieces, both in
thought and style. Recently he was presi
dent of the California synod and for the
past five years he has been closely identi
fied with the moral interests of this . city.
During the Mills meetings here he was
secretary of the ministerial association
and prepared an elaborate notice of r the
proceedings that is highly prized. ;*-â';"
In his pulpit Rev. P. Graif never uses a
scrap of paper nor does he employ the
memorieta method. He simply pours out
a stream. of thought and language, and
possesses remarkable magnetism. In col
lege he figured as a class poet, and gradu
ated from Gettysburg University. In his
new pastorate he follows closely such emi
nent divines as Drs. Penny and" Rowell.
Steps are about to be taken to secure an
eligible corner lot on which to erect a new
church edifice. Under this new alliance
the church is looking forward to a period
of renewed activity.
. The new pastor "has been for five years
the president and leader of the large Chau
tauqua Circle. He is also a post-graduate
as Ph.D. of the University of California,
and is now preparing a work on education
that has already attracted much attention.

â¢ On v seven of* the other starters in this

likely considered a more tempting bait at

rance or not the rooms held him at 8 to 1.
lAt 3-:55 p. m. the poolrooms gave Ferris
Hartman as the winner: of the second
event, which mistake was not rectified
until nearly an hour later. ; At the same
time Unity was given as the second horse.
Against Wyoming, the actual winner of
the race, 10 to 1 was laid, while at the
track he was 15. There were eight starters,
and wrong riders were given in five in

In tne third event seven started, and on
five of the horses the poolrooms had

him. The fifth race was also prolific of
odds and jockeys that, must have keen
brought down with the north pole from
the furthermost Arctic regions by Dr.

from Messenger & Co. of San Jose. Bor

the track, was at the short price of 2 to 1

Jones.. McClaine was uo on Fortuna,.
while in the race he was ridden by Cdady.
The last race clapped the climax. There
were' five starters and the rooms were
misinformed as to four of the jockeys.
At least that is supposed. The errors
have been intentional, if they would re
sult in gain. Ed Nearney and E. H.
Shirley were scratched at the track at
10:30 a. m., the race was run at 5:17 p. m.,
and thirteen minutes later neither horse
had yet been scratched. Still with service
as. rotten as this Messenger & Co. are still
retained to transact their business. A
total of forty-three jockeys sat astride
horses in the six different events, out of
which number the poolroom had twenty
eight wrongly placed, in addition to having
odds and jockeys posted on three scratched
horses. V^ ; :/V;^r : ;"~t;
An unfortunate mortal who made a

CHINESE INSPECTOR SHOT
A Highbinder Attempts to Kill a
Member of the See Yup
Company.
A Sacramento Streetcar Plunges Over
the Cobbles and Into the Big
Crowd.
A highbinder war with its customary
lawlessness and bloodshed has again
broken out in Chinatown.
As a result of the ill feeling existing be
tween the various factions, Ah Ling, a
member of the Sam Yup Company, was
nearly stabbed to death Saturday night,
presumably ;by a member of the See Yup
Company, and last evening Jue Tong, a
Chinese merchant association inspector,
was shot by Wong Tom, alias Wong Sing,
a well-known highbinder and a : member
of the Sam Yup Company.
' The shooting occured in a narrow stair
way leading up into a tenement-house at
805 Sacramento street. The wounded man
had just turned into the building and I had
started upstairs to his room when the as
sassin followed him to the doorway. With
out : a moment's warning he drew a
large revolver and fired.
Jue Tong fell on the stairs," and the
would-be murderer, still holding the ' re
volver in front of him ready for imme
diate use, ran rapidly down L Sacramento
street to Dupont, where he was captured
by Policeman of the Chinatown
squad. The Chinaman endeavored to turn
his pistol on his captor, but ; his actions
were quickly seen and the pistol wrenched
from his : grasp. ?/,â  The ; Chinaman was
placed in irons and taken back to where
the wounded man - :i lay. bleeding >on the
stairs. ; The patrol wagon was \ called and
the 'highbinder, with ; '-, his . victim, was
placed in the wagon, the former to be taken
to the California-street station and booked
on a charge of assault to murder, and the
latter was taken ,to the Receiving Hos
pital. On the trip to the hospital the man
who was shot bled profusely and had to be
supported by Policeman Lean. ' V â¢".'..'
To add, to the excitement when the
shooting occurred thousands of jabbering
Chinese surrounded the building in which
the s assault had been > made." ; A Sacra
mento-street car came over the hill just at
this" time, and in an endeavor to bring the
car to a standstill the gripmanputon the
track brakes with sufficient force to lift it

Rev. W. D. Williams' sermon to the
association was on the text, "Who could
find a virtuous woman, for her price is far
above rubies?" He said, in part:
An eminent minister, addressing a fashion
able audience In London, said: '"But even you.
my sisters, though only women, may yet find
some duty to perform." That was one estimate
of women and a common one. Here is an
other. On the marriage of Queen Victoria a
famous, poet wrote Prince Albert these words:
Esteem that wedded hand less for the scepter than
the ring,
And hold her uncrowned womanhood to be the
royal thing.
That Is the nobler estimate; uncrowned
womanhood is regal.
The Bible, the reservoir of the rights of man,
is the storehouse of the rights of woman. She
is presented on a plane of equality. The Bible
from "Paradise Lost" in Eye to "Paradise Re
gained" in Dorcas is the friend of woman.
Between those points we have honorable
mention of Sarah the beautiful, Ruth the lov
ing, Hannah the devout, Deborah the patriotic
and Abigail the wise. These represent the best
and highest qualities of humanity without
reference to sex. The rights of woman 1 What
are they in the light of this chapter? The
right to labor and to pray, the right to comfort
in distress, the right to bless when others
blame. The Institution represented here
to-night is not an ambulance at the foot of the
precipice, but a home and prevention above
the precipice. It is prevention, not cure, and
as such ranks with the foremost institutions of
our City. . -

of the library building.
Fragrant "blossoms and delicate ferns,

BROOKS IN THE PULPIT.
The California Poet Delivers an
Impromptu Sermon on .
Sermons.
Likens the Rev. Dr. Case of the How
ard-Street Church to Chauncey
M. Depew.
Fred Emerson Brooks, the California i
poet, last evening donned the robe sancti
raoriial and ascended with slow, thought
ful steps the pulpit of the Howard-street
Methodist Church.
Dr. Case had just finished an eloquent
and earnest sermon from the text,. "How
is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto
us aiid not unto the world?"
At the close of his sermon Dr. Case, al
luding to the poet, said: "Had Imy way
I should crown Mr. Brooks the laureate of
the United States." .
The pulpit was then placed in the back
ground and Mr. Brooks stood in front of
it and delivered a little sermon on ser
mons.
"There is but one way to deliver a ser
mon," said he; "that is to read a text and
then tell stories aDout it. People flock
from distant cities to listen to the silvered
utterances of Chauncey Depew, yet all that j
he does is to tell stories one after another.
This is what Dr. Case does," said the poet
with his most winning smile, "and 1 may
add that Dr. Case reminds me much of
Chauncey Depew. '.
"The only sermon I can remember is one
I listened to when I was a boy, and this
sermon was only a chain of stories."
it By way of illustration Mr. Brooks re
lated two of those stories. One was about
the saying in the Bible "Come unto me
and .1 will gather you under my wings
even as a hen gathereth her little
chickens." ' ;'.| . '.'
He described the hen clucking for her
progeny and pictured the hawk poised
overhead. Then after he had gotten the
chickens all under their mother's wing he
drew a moral by comparing the comfort
and safety of the sheltered ones to those
poor rascals out in the bushes where the
hawk could get at them. ..
. The poet closed his sermon reciting his
poem "Palestine," during the rendition
of which J. William Macy san-? "Jesus
Lover of My Soul." The effect was ex
ceedingly beautiful and dramatic.

That Vacant Look.
Joseph H. Choate seldom meets a suc
cessful antagonist in repartee, but he met
his match while trying a case in the Sur
rogate's court not long ago. Ati old woman
was being questioned about how a certain
testator had looked when a certain incident
had occurred. "Now, how I remember?
He's been dead two years," she. replied
testily. "Is your memory so poor that you
can't remember two years back?" con
tinued Choate. The old woman was silent,
and Choate asked: "Did he look any
thing like me?" "Seems to me he did
have the same sort of a vacant look!"
snapped the: witness. The questioning
was suspended. â New York Mail and Ex

tions in San Francisco, which held its
first session Friday night, met yesterday
morning and afternoon at 1159 Mission
street. There was a larce attendance of
delegates, nearly every one of whom en
tered into the spirit of the occasion with
enthusiasm, with the result that a plat
form was adopted as the sentiment of the
labor organizations.
The committee on resolutions submitted
its report, the secretary first reading the
cigarmakers' resolutions denouncing pri
vate ownership of lands and tools and
containing socialistic recommendations.
A discussion arose when the convention
was asked to pass upon this document.
R. T. Mclvor of the Painters' and Deco
rators' Union held that the report of the
'committee on resolutions be read, and
made a motion to that effect, as N. Blum
of the cigarmakers wanted his resolution
considered forthwith by the convention.
Mc lvor's motion was carried.
The declaration of principles from the
Painters' Union on equalization of capital
and labor was then read, but no sooner
was the reading finished than another dis
cussion as to what constituted the com
mittee's report took place. The conven
tion was not quite clear on this point,
some delegates maintaining that each res
olution should be acted on separately
while others thought that a definite report
should be offered. BES
"As a member of the committee on reso
lutions," said J. J. Ryan of the Boiler
makers' Union, "l recommend that the
report of the.committee be adopted."
"The manner of proceeding has been
already settled by a motion," Mclvor
added.
All the resolutions presented at Friday
night's session were read as follows: From
M. McGlynn, for a law to be enacted by
the next Legislature -making it illegal to
bring private detectives the Pinkertons â
into California; from Bakers' Union No.
94, to improve the sanitary condition of
bakeshops; from R. T. Mclvor, on the
hours of labor and method of production;
from the Typographical Union, that labor
unions publish papers for free distribu
tion; from the Carpenters' Union of Oak
land, protesting against the violation of
the eight-hour law and to invoke the aid
of Congress to enforce the law. When all
were read they were taken up singly for
discussion.
First came the resolutions of the Cigar
makers' Union. T. F. Burns (Cigarmak
ers') moved that the resolutions be accepted
as the sense of the convention and the pre
amble be adopted as the foundation upon
which the proposed labor organization is
to be built. N. Blum spoke at some length
in support of his resolution. He urged the
necessity of workingmen taking up poli
tics in their own behalf: The working
men, he declared, bad had enough experi
ence voting for tbe capitalist, for now they
are beginning to see the results of their
political work in that direction. The em
ployer, the capitalist, had at last a gun
capable of firing 400 times a minute on a
mi ib from a police wagon.
J. J. Ryan (Boilermakers') said prac
tically the same thing by way of corrobora
tion. He staled his conviction that work
ingmen should no longer vote for the cor
ner politician or the capitalist, but should
legislate for themselves. As an illustra
tion he said that workingmen who had
done this in Montana had raised the
minimum rate of wages in Butte City to
$', a day and in Anaconda to $2 50 per day.
T. F. Burns (Cigar-makers') said that
the preamble and resolutions should be
considered as a scientific proposition, and
hoped that the motion would prevail for
then San Francisco would stand before' the

labor world as a leader: in the social ques
tions involved, yyy^y l^'*
P. H. McCarthy (Carpenters') aroused
enthusiasm when he stated that it was
idle for delegates to teach the convention
matters with which they were thoroughly
familiar. This brought out a motion that
delegates be allowed to speak ; but once
j and at most? for five minutes,' which was
I carried.
The resolutions and preamble as follows
j were adopted unanimously:
Wheueas, The competitive system of in-
I dustrv based primarily upon the. individual
t ownership of nature's unmodified resources, '
and subsequently uponjthe individual owner
ship of the tools of production, has with the
march of invention and the evolution of so
ciety toward higher and more complex forms
of human relationship become an insuffera
ble burden and undeniable oppression to the
wage working classes; and whereas, the afore
said competitive system (otherwise known as
the capitalistic plan of private exploitation of
those deprived of tools and land) has, through
I its phenomenal accumulation of wealth into
the hands of the few, become a stumbling
block in the path of progress, a prolific cor
rupter of public freedom and a menace
to individual liberty, using its unjust ad
vantages over the masses of the people to
coerce and again cajole them into the support
of political measures which would be an insult
to the conscience of freemen and to which
their pressing physical needs alone give sanc
tion; and whereas, the mentally capable
among the wageworking classes, knowing the
unjust foundation of the competitive system
and the unequal advantages accruing to those
who control and profit oy it, are by far too
clever not to know that all this iniquitous.sys
tem can of its own motion possibly yield" to
the wageworker is merely that amount of his
product necessary to the renewal of his labor
power, withholding from him by the terms of
the system his well-earned leisure, luxury and
recreation; therefore be it
Resolved, That we, the accredited representa
tives of the trades and labor organizations of
San Francisco, in convention assembled, after
due deliberation, do hereby proclaim it to hi
our sincere conviction that the present anar
chical system of private individual|land and
tool owning, which places the many at the
mercy of the few, is the fundamental cause of
the industrial distress and economic slavery of
the masses of the workers; and that in accord
ance with the foregoing conviction we pro
ceed to organize our federated forces on such
lines as are best calculated to supplant com
petition and its fraudulent fundamentals, by
substituting therefor a system of universal co
operation founded upon the socialization of the
means of production â land, tools and capital:
and be it further
Retolved, That to this end we not only organ
ize industrially, but in addition thereto use
our political rights and privileges in a manner
consistent witn our economic belief, taking
such distinct political action as will forever
throw off the yoke of our capitalist masters.
The following platform, presented by R.
T. fllclvor, was adopted by a unanimous
vote :
1. Reduction of the hours of labor in propor
tion to the progress of production.
2. The United States shall obtain possession
of the railroads, canals, telegraphs, telephones,

When the convention was called to j
order after the noon recess , Thomas Cant- |
well was seated as a proxy delegate from
the American Railway Union. _.*.."..â¢_ Â
The set of principles submitted by the
Painters' Union and the resolutions of M.
McGlynn protesting against introducing
detectives into the State were adopted.
The Bakers' Union resolutions were also
adopted unanimously.
The resolution from T. Butler of Typo
graphical Union No. 21 was adopted, as
follows: . . â¢ . â¢ ; *â¢
. Resolved, That we recommend the following
to the convention: That meetings of the cen

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17. 1896.
I ous efforts be made to organize all trades and
I branches of j labor and convince them of the
j advisability of acting with the central body.
! That an industrial bureau be created, which
I shall appoint and supervise deputies in union
i workshops or other places, to the end that
| goods produced by union labor shall be pur-
I chased in preference to any other. That an
I official newspaper be published at least semi
: monthly and furnished free of cost to each
j member of the unions connected , with the
I labor council. That for the expenses of the
council and the official newspaper each union
j shall pay a per capita tax of not to exceed 1%
! cents per month.
The resolution from the Carpenters'
. Union of Oakland brought out a heated
l discussion and a now of oratory upon the
i eight-hour question. This resolution pro
i tested against abuses of the eight-hour law
' and was intended for presentation to Con
gress for aid.
A delegate from Oakland stated that he
I bad worked in various places in San Fran
cisco and Oakland where men were worked
ten hours. The Union Iron "Works, where
he worked, violated the law in this respect,
and in one instance an employe told the
delegate that men had to be worked over
time or else manufacturers could not suc
ceed in competition. . Mclvor added that
the law was violated as a matter of course
even by the United States Government,
] and Congress was aware of that fact to a
' man. The remedy lay in voting those
! men out of ollice.
J. J. Ryan remarked that Contractor
Day, who built the Columbia River locks,
'. compelled the men to work overtime so
that few men could bear the hardÂ»work.
! If the long hours did not suit them the
'â  workingmen were told to "get off the res
! ervation." And that was a Government
I contract. The resolution was adopted
j without a dissenting voice.
The question of a permanent central
! labor organization and the embodiment of
j the various resolutions and the platform
: were' taken under consideration. A great
â  diversity of opinion was manifested by
i delegates, and correspondingly different
suggestions were made. One proposition
; was the appointment of a committee
; which should have full power to consider
i the preamble, platform, etc., looking to
ward political action. Another one was to
: adjourn subject to the call of the chair
I and meanwhile inform the different labor
| unions represented by circular letter of
what was done at the convention. Then
j the delegates could meet again with in
structions as to how they should act in re
-1 gard to organizing a permanent federation
; of trades.
The advisability of pursuing a political
j rule for the amelioration of labor was dis
cussed. Some delegates declared that
: politics should not be allowed to enter into
' the debates. H. Meyer, president of Car
; penters' Union No. 22, touched an appar
i ently tender spot in the thoughts of the
labor representatives when he said:
"There was a time when the boycott
was considered a pretty good weapon of
defense: there was a time when strikes
were regarded as a power. But these times
; have gone; they are a thing of the past,
and now we are convinced that the only
hope for labor is in the ballot."
j A motion made by E. L. Maulsbary of
i Carpenters' Union No. '22 solved the prob-
I lem. It was with an amendment that a
committee consisting of one delegate from
each union be appointed to arrange the
j platform and resolutions and to organize a
, plan of permanent organization for the
; new federation. . The following-named
delegates were appointed on the com
i mittee:
Carpenters, 483â C. F. Schaat.
Woodworkersâ A. Miller.

T. F. Burns (Cigar-makers) offered the
following resolution, which was unani
mously adopted : .
That we denounce the proposed new charter
as perpetuating the infamous and wasteful
j system of contracts for public works, making
I it compulsory oi future civic authorities; also
| for its ; other provision directly against the
j rights and interests of labor; also in that it
does not provide for the initiative and refer
endum, proportional representation, or any
j means whatever of Insuring government by
! the people instead of by bosses.
The convention adjourned until four
weeks from yesterday.

promptly, but the combustible contents of the
barn mede it impossible for the flames to be
extinguished until the building had been en
tirely destroyed. â  It is presumed that the fire
started from a lighted cigar being carelessly
thrown in the refuse which covered the barn
floor. The damage will amount to about $1000,

ZIMMERMAN "HAS CAME"
Will Loiter Round Among the
Cyclers Here for Some
Days.
HE MAY QUIT THE TRACK.
Interesting Story of His Experiences
Round the Worldâ Has an En
ticing Offer From Paris.
.
A. A. Zimmerman, champion cyclist of
the world, arrived on the Monowai from
Australia yesterday and is stopping at the
Palace. He is accompanied by his wife. I
He is in excellent condition and good j
spirits, and is apparently well pleased with j
his experiences round the world. He I
parts his hair in the middle, wears a noisy- I
figured silk vest, a brown suit and an im- j
mense diamond on his finger.
He will remain here for some days and j
be entertained by local cycling clubs. His j
plans for the future are somewhat in abey- j
ance. He says he is not certain that he
will do any riding for some time, as, be
sides a desire to rest up after his journey- '
ings, he is inclined to turn his attention
"to business," the manufacture and sale
of the "Zimmy" wheel.
With legard to his Australian experi
ences he shows no disposition to make
excuses. He says he suffered from the ex
treme heat, the" hot winds and blinding I
sand blasts, and, for a time after arriving i
there, a slight attack of malaria. He is
not enthusiastic about Australia in any
way. The climate is disagreeable, he
says. The day they left the mercury
registered . 116 "in the shade. The towns
are at long distances apart, the railroads
in bad shape, the traces are all slow j '
grass tracks, except the St. Kilda track at I
Melbourne. However, he says, snorts
have a large following, and crowds ol from !
12.000 to 27,000 people attended the races.
Liberal prizes are offered, as may be with
this plethoric "gate."
He began his Australian racing at Ade
laide, where he won two races. At Sydney
he won two. at Brisbane he won five, at
Newcastle four, at Melbourne six. The â¢
races were all handicaps heat races, and
the scratch men had little chance. Some :
of the races required six and seven heats.
The Australians, he says, are not so fast as
in America and France. They have not 1
had the experience, and the conditions are <
not favorable. The best time he made on
the grass tracks was 2:22. â¢â¢f â¢ y
"Yes, I have kept reasonably well in
formed as to cycling affairs in this coun- I
try," said the champion. "I am rather ''
surprised at the outcome of the last sea- ;
son racing. I expected to see some one j
rise up distinctly superior to the general
crowd. While some few have distin- ;
guished themselves above others, still l
I there is no one who has signalized himself ;
I over the others. Yes, I have noted the
change in the rules drawing simple lines
between amateurs and professionals, and i
I I think it is a good one."
Speaking of the result of his tour round
the the world, he said: "Well it has kept
me hustling. There is a. great deal of
difference between racing in this country
where one knows the speed of every one
and a great deal about his methods, when
to spurt and when to keep in reserve. In
England and in France the men were all
to new to me, kept me guessing and riding
all the time for all I was worth. It was
very hard work, ln France great interest
is taken in cycling and immense crowds
go to the races. The races in Paris, Bor
deaux, Lyons, Milan and Florence are

managed by a single firmâ two men. The
average attendance at Paris is from 15,000
to 22,000 people. The races, are run twice
a week, on Thursdays and Sundays.
"1 have an offer to go to Paris for the
entire season at $500 per week, riding out
one day of the week, but I have not deter
mined to accept. I was paid $5000 for my
original visit there to ride three races.
That was in 1894."
Zimmerman is 26 years of age. He be
gan racine; in 1887 at Queens. L. I. Since
that time he has . won $30,000 worth of
prizes, other than cash prizes. Among
these were 10 pianos, 27 gold watches, 38
diamond studs said to be. worth $5000, on
which he could â :..-" not realize half that
amount he fears. He has won 4 horses, 7
carriages, 145 medals, worth from $30 to
$100 each, which he thinks could not be
sold for more than an average of $7 50.
The most valuable prizes he has won
were aslooo team, of horses and a $1000
gold cup at Indianapolis. The sum of the
money prizes he has won as a professional
he refuses to disclose.
The medals, cups, rings, studs and the
300 or 400 silver pieces, ; mugs, cups,
pitchers, sugar-bowls and all such things,
he says, he has kept and intends to keep.
The horses, pianos and other non-portable
aud bulky articles he has Isold. and traded
away.
His best record in any season was that
of 1893, when he made 101 firsts, and failed
of first but three times.

IS KNOWN AND NOT KNOWN
Many Names Given the Burglar
Killed in the Franklin
Residence.
Police Searching Eagerly for Friends
or Acquaintances of the Man '
at the Morgue.
"The man is not yet identified," said
Captain Lees last night, speaking of the
burglar killed at the Franklin residence on
Friday morning. "I have had half a dozen
men state positively that they know the
man's name, but investigation has failed
to substantiate their statements, and I
have seen too many instances of mistaken
identity to believe a man identified till
corroborative circumstances can be found."
The man at the Morgue is a very familiar
type. He is apparently of Irish extraction.
He is not a bad-looKing man, has a fairly
well shaped head and features that indi
cate a certain refinement of nature foreign
to the brutal characteristics of the pro
fessional criminal. His face is neither very
good nor very bad. In fact, it is of such a
common type that, it impresses almost
every observer with the feeling that he has
seen it somewhere before.
All day crowds of people thronged
into the Morgue. Many went hoping to
identify the man: More were drawn by
idle curiosity. Among the latter were
many women. :.-/y : y;.
Among those who came to identify the
man was Peter Vidovich. He was brought
by Officer Rourke, and at once recognized
the man as one with whom he had had
trouble in the gallery of the Grand Opera
house on last Monday night.
Vidovich and the policeman haunted the
cheap amusement resorts and cheap lodg
ing-houses last night in an attempt to find
the dead man's companions. They did
not find them, however.
George Delmas and H. F. Stone, two
special officers employed at the Grand
Opera-house, substantiated Vidovich's
story, and also agreed in his description of
the companions of the dead burglar, al
though neither of them had paid any at
tention to the - man â¢ killed by Miller or
could remember to have seen him. ' Vido-
vich is sure that the dead man is a fellow
who took his seat at the theater Monday
night. He demanded his seat, and a quar
rel ensued, and Vidovich retired. The in
terloper looked" him up later and wanted
to thrash him, when a man. with a large,
fat, red face and shabby clothes also of
fered to thrash . Vidovich. Special Stone
at this juncture came up, and he remem
bered Vidovich and the fat-faced man, and
thinks he could identify the latter.:
There was a tall man, with a heavy
black mustache, who also offered to thrash
Vidovitch. He joined the burglar during
the last act, going up from the lower gal
lery. The man' was recognized and de
scribed by George Delmar, another special
officer. The names of none of the men
are known.
A man from Oakland, who refused to
give his name, said a painter friend of his
had recognized the dead man as Michael
Dennett, or Denny, a painter whom he
had known in Victoria, B.C. The man
refused to give the name of; the Oakland
painter, saying his friend had just got a
job and did not want the risk of losing it
by being called as a witness. *
Captain ' Lees has also received . several
,new identifications, â  none of which are
verified. -.
A Morning Brawl.
Harry Madson, a laborer, quarreled- with
Charles Erickson while he was drunk yester
day morning about 7 o'clock. They came to
blows' and Madson tried to kill Erickson with
a pistol. .He was arrested by Officer Williams

deadly weapon. ;.,..-. .

OPPOSED TO REFUNDING
Views of Railroad Commissioner
Stanton on the Central
Pacific Debt.
Explains "Why a Long Extension
Means Certain Loss to the
Government.
Railroad Commissioner James Stanton
is strongly opposed to any measure that
will give the Central Pacific Company con
cessions and advantages in the settlement
of its debts with the Government that
would not be given by a creditor to an or
dinary debtor in the general run of com- j
mercial transactions. And he is also op- |
posed to any legislation on the subject
that would saddle the indebtedness of the
company on the producers and manufac
turers of the State of California.
"An extension of the debt for a period
of fifty or a hundred years as is proposed,"
he said, "would be most unbusinesslike
and devoid of sound commercial sense." |
Continuing, he said:
Why, in fifty years methods of transporta- |
tion may be entirely changed. By that time !
we may be traveling through the air. And we j
will, at least, have electric railroads. Now
with cheaper, faster and more agreeable meth- j
ods ot transportation for both goods and pas
sengers, what would be the value of such a
line as the Central Pacific Railroad?
The most that should be done is to extend
the payment, If it' is extended at all, for a
short period, say ten years, at the utmost, and
then only if security is given that is sure to I
realize the full amount of the indebtedness if '
foreclosure proceedings should have to be |
taken. Instead of accepting the Central Pa
cific Railroad only as security let the owners of
the Central Pacific, who are also the stock
holders in the Southern Pacific Company,
mortgage such of their other properties as
the Government may require justly in order
to amply protect it. Then, if the Central Pa
cific at the end ot the ten years has paid off a
part of the debt and has shown its Intentions
to deal fairly with the United States, let an
other extension be made if Congress finds it
advisable to grant it.
I do not believe it would be wise for the Gov
ernment to obtain the ownership and assume
control of the property.' Experiments in vari
ous States of the Union have shown that it is
not feasible for the Government to operate
small lines or sections. If there is to be Gov
ernment ownership it should extend to a line
from ocean to ocean, and embrace a .complete
system, with ample feeders in all ' sections.
But for such a project conditions are not now
at all favorable.
' The simple inability of a debtor to pay his
debts should not be any excuse for granting
him time. He must show sufficient' resources
or security to warrant the creditor in permit
ting him to remain in business, and the Cen
tral Pacific should be treated in this spirit.
They have had a long time in which to prepare
for their obligations, but while the chief stock
holders have laid up vast fortunes, the road is
virtually bankrupt. Yet its directors have the
effrontery to ask concessions that are abso
lutely out of reason,
: lam afraid, however, that foreclosure would
result in giving the same people the road.
They could afford to pay at least $1,000,000
more than any other company or syndicate,
simply as a means of preventing competition.
But I believe the Government could recover
the debt by going after the private fortunes of
the different individuals who promoted and
carried on the enterprise. :
Appetite Without Taste.
A good dinner is. a complex harmony;
and men with uneducated palates may
just as well sit down to an ox whole
roasted and a hogshead of metheglin as
attend a civilized and artistic table. They
have grand appetites, these fellows, and I
hope are thankful for the blessing; but a
man with an appetite and no taste is like
a person who hammers away at a piano
without knowing a tune. Boston Journal
