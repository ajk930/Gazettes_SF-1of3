LONDON, -E.g., Feb. Parliament
assembled to-day. after a recess of IGOdays,
for what promises to be one of the most
important sessions of recent years. There
were the usual crowds about Westminster,
and the best' known of the members as
they made their appearance on foot or in
vehicles were heartily cheered." Especially
'demonstrative were' the receptions given
to the Marquis of Salisbury, Henry Broad
hurst, the workingmen's representative,
Anthony Mundella, Sir William Vernon
Harcourt, Herbert Gladstone, Thomas
Burt, the miner, John Burns and Explorer
Stanley. 1 /*/. ;- i Z tX'-y'- : y l 'y^'i
Both houses filled up unusually early,
and with few exceptions every member of
the Commons was in his place when the
gentleman usher of the Black Rod, Ad
miral Sir "Edmund Commerill, made his
appearance and with the usual formalities
summoned them to appear in the House
of Lords for the' purpose of hearing the
Queen's speech, which was as follows:
My Lords and Gentlemen: I continue to re
ceive irom other powers assurances of friendly
sentiments. An agreement has been con
cluded between my Government and France,
the principal object of which is to secure the
establishment of the independence of Slam. 4 !
The Commissioners of the delimitation of
the frontier, which separates my. Indian em
pire and Afghanistan trom Russia have agreed
upon a line which has been accepted by my
self and the Emperor of Russia. â¢ .
The Government of the United States of
America has expressed a wish to co-operate in
the termination of. the differences which, have
existed /or many years between my Govern
lent and the republic of .Venezuela upon the*
nrstloir <rf the" between that coun
try and the colony of British Guiana. 'â¢'â¢"'
1 have expressed my sympathy with the de
sire to cOme to an equitable arrangement, and
trust that further negotiations, will lead to a
factory result. The Sultan of ; Turkey his
sanctioned the principal reforms in the gov
ernment of Armenian provinces, for which,
jointly with the Emperor, of Russia and the
President of the French Republic, I have felt
it my duty to pres^. I deeply regret the fanat
ical outbreak on the part of a- section of the
Turkish population which has resulted in a
series of massacres which have caused the
deepest indignation in this country. . v .: j-' '
A sudden incursion into the South African
Republic by an armed force from the territory
under control of .the British South Africa Com
pany resulted in. a deplorable collision with
the burgher forces. .-â¢â¢â "â¢!;" .
" My Ministers at the earliest possible moment
. intervened to prohibit, through the Govern
ment, this hostile action and to warn all my
subjects in. South Africa against taking part in
it. â¢ The origin and circumstances of these pro
ceedings will be made the subject of a search
ing investigation. 'â ,'..
The President of the South African Republic,
acting In this matter with moderation and wis
dom, has agreed to place the- prisoners in the
hands of my Government. I have undertaken
to bring to trial the leaders of the expedition.
The conduct of the President of the South
African Republic, upon' this occasion and the
assurances which he has voluntarily given
lead me to believe â  that he recognizes the im
portance of redressing the legitimate griev
ances of which complaint has been made by a
majority of the persons inhabiting the Trans
vaal. - â¢'â  "*** 'â â ''*. -â  â¢ ! -
The condition of .affairs in Ashantee and the
violation by the King, at Kumusi, ol the pro
visions of the. treaty of 1874, as. regarded the
suppression of the practice of offering human
sacrifices,' the freedom of trade ana the main
tenace of communications, have for some years
engaged the serious' attention of my Govern
ment. All endeavors to induce the King to
observe his engagements proved fruitless, and
it became necessary.to: send an armed expedi
tion to Kumasi to enforce the conditions of the
treaty. While I rejoice to announce . that the .
objects of the expedition have been achieved
without bloodshed, I have to deplore the loss
from the severities of : the climate of some
valuable Uv6a, including that of my beloved
son-Fn-law, v Prince ; ; Henry of ; Batten berg, who
volunteered | his services. *.' and my dear
daughter- are greatly touched and comforted
bythe widespread sympathy which has been
shown by my subjects throughout the Empire,
at home and. abroad. Â'â .5 ,, Â r _'7J?s
Geetlemenj of the' House of Commons: : I
have directed the estimates for service for the
year to '.be .laid before you. ".They have been
prepared with the utmost regard to economy,
but the exigencies of the times require an in
creased expenditure. . 7
My lords and gentlemen : The extension and
improvement of the naval defenses of the em
pire is the [ most important subject to which
your efforts can be directed and will doubtless
occupy your most earnest attention. I regret
to say that the condition of agriculture is dis
astrous beyond recent experience.
Measures will be laid before you with the ob
ject of mitigating the distress of the classes en
gaged in that industry.*-/ Measures will also be
submitted to you for, the creation of voluntary
schools for the regulations of alien pauper im
migration . and : for the construction of light
railways of the â  rural districts. You will also
be asked: to consider the'; employers' limited
liability bill, an Irish land bill and 'a measure
for the formation of an Irish board of s agricul

The House of Commons ; after listening
to "the" Queen's speech in ' the .House of
Lords resumed its sitting at 4. o'clock, the:
usual Hour of assembling, y except on
. Wednesdays, when *'-, the ; House 7 meet? at
noon. The Right Hon. Joseph Chamber
lain, Secretary of , State 7 for ; Colonies,
entered - the House) shortly-, after it had
been called to order, and was vociferously
cheered. Right y Hon. George' J. Goschen; ,
First Lord 7of the Admiralty, announced;
that on . February) 13 . the Government
would introduce a bill providing f for the
The San Francisco Call.
construction of works for naval purposes.
The- announcement was 7 received Â with
cheers from all sections of the House. Mr.
George Goschen Jr., son of the Right Hon.
George 'â¢ J. Goschen, Member for the East
Grinstead ' Division 7of Sussex, 1 moved the
address in reply- to the .speech from. the
throne, and the motion ;- was 7 seconded by
Sir Hernert E. Maxwell, member for Wig
townshire. ; : â  ,S- ; .. .
Sir William Harcourt, Chancellor of the
Exchequer in the late Ministry and leader
of the . opposition 7in the 7 House, said he
had never in all his experience met such
critical circumstances as those with which
they were confronted. -It was in the
highest degree desirable, he said, that the
misunderstanding between Great Britain
and ; the United States over "the Monroe
doctrine should be -removed in both coun
tries at the earliest pqssible moment. - The
Government of the United States had ex
pressed a desire to co-operate in a friendly
solution of the dispute between Great
Britain arid , Venezuela, and he was ' re
joiced to see in the speech from the throne
that the prospect was welcomed. The only
practical question remaining was whether, ;
in the Venezuelan difficulty, there had
been any invasion of the rights, of the
United States, as upon that point no pro
nouncement had been made by tho United
States Government. â¢ 'â .'â XXXX'-X..]-
It was, in his judgment, a doubtful
question whether the United States could
justly co-operate in the settlement of . the
Venezuelan , difference in default of ' that
Government having, in its possession 'all
of the information bearing thereon which
was at England's . disposal. He therefore
regretted the delay in the publication of
â  the case of Great Britain ' and demanded
that a prompt and honorable conclusion of
the affair be arrived at. . '.; ; . _ i
The Right Hon. Arthur J. Balfour, First
Lord of the Treasury and Government
leader in tne House, followed Sir William
Harcourt. yy' _â ;
"Sir William," he . said, "has attacked
some opinions that were never held. by, the
ministerial side. We never suggested for
a moment that the United States intended
to insult Great Britain in 'inquiring into
the Venezuelan boundary matter. The
Government does not see any reasons for
offering any criticism of the _ Monroe doc
trine. So far from looking at the appoint
ment of the American , commission as
an insult, the United -' States Gov
ernment "having appealed -to . us in
ordinary diplomatic intercourse to aid
them with all the information at our dis
posal, at the earliest moment we shall give
it, but when Sir William - Harcourt says
that the Venezuelan boundary is in ob
scurity and no clear view can be taken, let
me remind him ; that since 1844 England
has made serious and honest attempts to
get it settled, for reasons not connected
with English politics, ambition or greed.
Each attempt failed. Wo will not be pre
vented by diplomatic ', punctillios or false
pride from trying toy finally settle it
[Cheers.]'" ' ' - - - -â¢ -
'It is impossible to foresee , what gene
ral conclusions the American commission
or those who are inquiring into the British'
case here may arrive at, but I am certain
that every onÂ«, American or British, who
rs impartially considering the subject, will'
be convinced that there ' never has .been'
and is not now: the slightest intention on
the part , of. England to _ violently attack
the substance of the Monroe doctrine. No
illegitimate ambition nor unworthy greed
for territory or desire to step beyond the
due limits or frontiers of the empire has
ever animated the British-policy through
out this long controversy. XxX~XX'I
â â â¢ "I can only add that I shall rejoice that
the country and the public opinion of the
world will rejoice, if , out of this toil shall
spring the good fruit of a general system
of arbitration.; If that shall . be the result
of these controversies, I shall feel that all
the evil done will have been more than
compensated for, and that a permanent
guarantee of the. good will of the English
speaking peoples en * both sides of the
Atlantic : will have ' been obtained for all
time." [Cheers.] .
â¢ In tne House of Lords the address in
reply to the Queen's speech was moved by
Lord Stanmore and seconded by the Earl
of Rosslyn. . : â 
! Lord Rosebery . said, he was glad to see
that the negotiations for the settlement of
the difficulties in the Transvaal were pro
gressing. : He expressed his approval of
the conduct of Mr. Chamberlain, Secre
tary of State for the Colonies, who had
exhibited statesmanlike courage and
promptitude of decision, i. ...--.. '. -,
He greatly deplored ; the recent 1 utter
ances of Lord Salisbury which, on the part
of the Boers, had tended to a feeling of
distrust of England's good faith, and
would lead to belief that the sympathy of '
the Government was with the invaders of
the territory of the South African republic.
He . demanded Xto 7 know what ; form the
Government's inquiry would take in regard
to the relations of : the chartered British
South Africa Company to the transactions
* which had J recently taken -place in the
Transvaal, and also ( ! desired to know why
the Government had been ignorant; of
what had been going on at Mafeking prior
to Dr. Jameson's raid. 7 It was obvious, he
said; that the charter of the British South
Africa Company must be revised. â¢_.â¢.â¢_
Turning his attention to the situation in
Armenia Lord = Rose beryy' said Lord Salis
bury's recent statements in regard to the
obligations of England under the terms of
the treaty of Berlin were absolutely' incor- !
rect. 'The whole point to be taken into
consideration was that the powers signa
tory to the treaty should see â¢ to it that the
reforms required by that s instrument were
carried into effect. The 'Cyprus conven
tion laid special obligations upon England
and such an expression impotency as
that conveyed by the statement which had
been made by the Premier ' had never be
fore been made by a British Minister. Was
there, he asked, peace with honor?
-.Continuing,.- Lord i Rosebery said the
action of the Government regarding Ar
menia y was X most - mysterious. He v felt
forced to believe, he said, that the Govern
ment had decided to abandon the cause - of .
the Armenians and that Lord Salisbury
was i prepared to repudiate the utterances
made in his speeches at Brighton and in
the Guildhall. ;â  J r y.'-"X 'X XX.X .

The preliminaries to the affair were ar

lynched. /':â¢.-" â V .-â ",â ' '
" The mob acted quickly and marched
directly from the school-house to the jail,
which was only protected "'by the sheriff
and one lone deputy. ' Here the demand
for Atterbury .was refused and then ; the
door was knocked down arid in with sledge
hammers. ( The sheriff feigned resistance,
apparently, and fired his pistol in the air.
In the meantime crowds "of '.people be
gan gathering about the jail, but no at
tempt was made to help the sheriff. After
the 7 sheriff fired his revolver the mob
opened fire. Amid shots and': yells they
marched upstairs, leaving a few to keep
back the crowd.
But two minutes were consumed in
breaking down the iron door. ... Atterbury
was dragged from his cell amid the' howls
of the other prisoners in the jail, who
where badly frightened.
'. The prisoner /. resisted , with all f. his
strength and much trouble was experienced

like a demon, but when he was finally got

P. Huntington is a great philanthropist,
who engages in railroad building tor the
sole purpose of . benefiting his fellow-men.
He says that Huntington has never been a
railroad-wrecker for ' personal- gain ;/ for
what time was he a wrecker? That be has
been one the Senator knows from the his
tory of the old Elizabethtown and Paducah
Railroad, which now forms a part of ' the
Chesapeake, 7 Ohio 7 and Southwestern.
Three or four of the men who* were alluded
to in Mr. Huntington's letter /to/ the
Courier-Journal as assisting him in getting
the Southern Pacific charter < were the
incorporators of that road,' and it was not
long before it fell into Mr. Huntington's
hands. It was well understood in Ken
tucky at the time that these incorporators
were dummies. ,/ ... X
'-, The Senator is under many obligations
to.< Huntington and Echols, and. his
presence in the ; Senate at this time is a
pretty, good proof of the fact. ' The Sena
tor was one { of l the : incorporators [ of the
: road from Elizabethtown to Hodginville.
j which he and. a couple of associates
| turned over to Huntington as soon as fin
ished for a consideration. .
His frank admission that' the opposition
in the Senate is not strong enough to pre
vent the passage of.'. the bill .bond not for
a moment be, allowed to deceive any one.
They will delay the bill in the Senate till
they are ready for it in the House.' '
The "strong case" will be presented
there when they think they have enough
votes pledged to defeat .:/â 
Senator Hays has endeavored to get the
influence of some of the old | bosses in
Louisville by introducing a bill to pension
the firemen of â  that city aftar : a certain
term of j service, . and this would have
been a good trick for . him V but for the fact
that j the Democratic - Mayor, Mr. Tyler,
died a short time ago and a Republican
Mayor was elected in his place, and hav
ing the City Council, almost solidLy with
him ': has set about ' making ' wholesale
changes in the ranks of city officers and
employes, especially the firemen and po
lice, and the .major's* plans have miscar
ried. He and the others are, however,
trying to arrange matters on a new basis,
but it will De hard for them to control ; the
Louisville delegation in the House as they
are men who have never ';. been in politics
before and don't owe their election to any
of the city bosses. , , . . ,7* " y
The attendance of 'the members was
much more prompt and a little fuller than
yesterday, as the vote shows. The joint
session met promptly at noon, with Sena
tor Goebel in the chair.
The chamber of the House was packed
to suffocation. The same crowd that was
present last week to see an election or a
fight was down again to-day, Louisville,
Lexington, Harrodsburg, Covington and
other places contributing their quota of
politicians, big and little, and sensation
seekers. The session ended, â¢ however,
without any sign of a "scrap," nothing
more hurtful than words being set in mo
tion, which don't kill directly, 7 but some
times lead ' to | killing in cases like these.
Nothing* of the sort, however, has' hap
pened in the' Kentucky Legislature

devoutly to be wished f that the sky will

j There was something very much like a

most of the people present when the House
went into the joint ; session without ' any
move toward calling up the contest cases.
'The crisis is only postponed, however,

If the Republicans drop Hunter and
take Willson, they stand a chance of
electing him nt once. If they take ex-
Chief Justice Holt they have the same
chance. "Tony" Carroll, the only Demo
cratic representative from Louisville, y and
who has been voting for "scattering" from
the first, married Judge' Holt's daughter,
arid, of course, he/would vote for his father
in-law, but Dr. Hunter persists in staying
on the track, though he sees that he can
not be elected unless Kaufman from Lex
ington and Tompkins from Owensboro are
unseated and replaced with, their Repub
lican contestants, v
This the Republicans say they have a
legal right to do, as they have had formal
investigations and * reports." There . were

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 11.â During
the session of the State Legislature in Jan

! Belsbaw introduced two resolutions in the
House, known as No. 2 and 3, which ,were
adopted and sent to j the Senate. The u^ '

of any sort. When this bill was intro
duced the feeling of ;' the majority of 'the
people of the State was against funding,
and many j members ; of > both House and
Senate went to the Legislature pledged by
their constituents to take steps toward any
measure which might be introduced in

In spite ;of the â  fact that they were so
pledged there were many who were ex

of the. Southern Pacific Company, and
almost insurmountable obstacles * were
thrown into the pathway of these resolu

TO PHOTOGRAPH THE /BBAIX.

Midnight. ...'.. , -
ORANGE, N. J., Feb. Illâ Thomas/A.
Edison said to-day that he is not yet ready
for his attempt to photograph the human
brain. He has, decided that when every
thing is in readiness the experiment will
be made after midnight, when no one will
.be around but bis workmen, as the pres
ence of others would 'tend to make the
subject nervous, . ; â¢ , ..y \ â  . â  - ; .
To-day Mr. Edison tested the theory of

rays are really sound rays or waves. He
took a ;' steel funnel a few, inches long and
placed it in front of a powerful vacuum
tube, the small end. opposite the. plate,
and the test was partially successful. .He
got a clearly defined spot with a . penum
bra above it and another below it, which
showed that ; the rays had * not been
deflected. -He says that he is ( . puzzled to
explain this. . . .
Mr. Edison has made interesting experi
ments on thirty different substances . and
the results show perfect penetration ol
hard and soft rubber, celluloid, gelatine,
shellac, boric acid, amber, camphor and
blood vulcanized fiber and gutta
percha: the penetration of slate, iron

that antimony, iron ; brass, tin, lead, plati- .

INTERESTING REPORTS MADE.
Chairman Gideon of the Racing Eoard
i Makes Some Important Rec
ommendations.
BALTIMORE, Md., Feb. 11. â The
League of American Wheelmen to-day
elected officers and decided to bold the
next National meet at Louisville. The
ticket chosen is as follows: President,
Sterling Elliott, Massachusetts; first vice
president, M. F. Cossum, New York; sec
ond vice-president, A. C. Morrison Wis
consin; treasurer, S. S. Hartwell, Colo
rado.
There was but one ticket ; for auditing
committee and J. Fred Adams of New
York, J. J. Van Nort of Pennsylvania and
C. A. McArty of Colorado were chosen.
The second day's morning session of the
convention was called to order by Presi
dent Wiilison at 11 o'clock. The report of
the credentials committee showed that 110
members and 67 proxies were present.
President Willison's annual report re
viewed the work 7of the league and
strongly recommended that the executive
committee be authorized to take steps for
the incorporation of the league. George
'A. Perkins, secretary of the executive com
mittee, Treasurer Mergenthaler and Secre
tary Bassett also delivered their annual
reports. The balance in the league treas
ury is $4235. In closing bis annual report
Treasurer Mergenthaler stated' that he
must decline _to ;be a candidate for re
election. r .. . â yXyjyX
â  Secretary Bassett's report showed an in
crease in membership during the year of
13,183, of which New York made the great
est gain, almost half of the total increase
-being accredited to that State. The total
membership list embraces 1470 lady mem
bers, a gain of 780 since the preceding
report.
Isaac B. Potter of New York reported
for the highway improvement com
mittee.
W. M. Brewster, chairman of the com
mittee on transportation, reported the
' progress which had been made during the
year in the line of compelling railroad
companies to carry free the bicycles of
wheelmen, when accompanied by their
riders. X''J y-XxXX-
Chairman Gideon's report says among
other things: f-^,
--< "Over 900 suspensions have been made
during the year, one-half of them being
permanent. It is suggested that further
rules be made for the government of pro
fessionals by fines for minor offenses, to be
inflicted, perhaps, by the official referee,
rather than suspensions." X
In speaking of class B men ; being called
amateurs, Mr. Gideon said: "The need in
the first place for what must be admitted
to be a misnomer lay in the fact that
when the class was first formed profession
alism was not considered strictly, honor
able. Experience of the past year has
shaken this opinion and there is no longer
a good reason for miscalling these men.
Call them 'class B riders' if you will, or
â¢trade professionals,' or â  'league profes
sionals,' or anything, not amateurs."
In discussing the question as to the ulti
mate disposition of -class B, the report
says the problem is difficult from the fact
that any change is an experiment. No
one really knows what is best. A conser
vative step is recommended. . "Let us
bave," Mr. Gideon said, "a class of B riders
since there is a demand for them, but let
us also refuse to call them 'amateurs.'
"They should be eligible to league mem
bership and should be required to join the
league. It is recommended- that our
system of records be changed so that many
less records be allowed. It would seem
that the quarter, one-third, one-half and
one mile flying start, paced and the same
distances unpacea', in each class should be
sufficient, outside of the regular competi
tion records. ~isl9H_HfeE__BÃ
"It is proposed that in another year it
would be belter to have a series of circuits,
starting one in the West, one in the South
and another in the East, all converging to
a central point, which should be the na
tional meet of the league; fiom there a,
combined circuit should be continued to
say October 1, after which time the per
centage of failures is too heavy to warrant
continuance.
"The proposed abandonment of the con
trol of racing just at this time when it is
most thoroughly within the control of the
league your board considers extremely
ill advised and unnecessary. The argu
ment that it keeps members out of
the league is best answered by } the fact
that it has been necessary to keep -on the
desk; of the chairman a batch" of blank ap
plications for membership which are con
tinually called for, sometimes even from
Brooklyn. It is believed, therefore, that
'cycle racing of the league, for the league,
should not perish.' " (With apologies to
A. Lincoln.)
The report was well received and
adopted.
The convention at 1:30 o'clock took a
recess for an hour. After considerable
time had been consumed in wrangling
over the admission of the report of the
special committee appointed to confer with
the Board of Trade in : relation to certain
printing to be inserted in the catalogues of
various manufacturing concerns the elec
. tion of officers was proceeded with, y .
The â¢ different men - were nominated 'in
brief speeches and the ticket was chosen in
short order. The ballot for president ?re
sulted 104 for Elliott and 73 for Wiilison.
The Louisville and Toledo forces then"
put on their X armor and; prepared for the
.final struggle for the honor of entertaining
the wheelmen during the National meet in
the summer of 1896.
The representatives of each were given
twenty-five minutes in which to sing the
praises of their cities. Messrs. Watt; and
Bowden dilated. '.upon""' the attractions _ of '
Louisville, while W. D. Judson of Oswego,
N. V., and J. M. Brown of Toledo spoke'
for the Ohio city. 7 v "â â â .
The appearance of a New York man' in
the interest of Toledo was * a part of the
deal, ;it being 7 understood -that Elliott's
supporters would favor the Ohio city. That
they did not keep faith soon became; pa-" i
tent to those who were watching the vote.
When the result was announced as 97 for
Louisville to 81 for Toledo a mighty shout
went up from the throats of the delegates
and visitors.
"Immediately after the announcement
the convention adjourned until to-mor

BURGLARS WITH AN APPETITE.
After Looting the Home of Governor Mat
thews the Thieves Calmly Dine on
Cold Victuals.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Feb. 11.â The
home of Governor Matthews, on North
Illinois street, was entered by burglars last
night and the executive's gold watch and
$12 in money were stolen. The burglars
were in the house some time, as they set
the table in the dining-room, placed Mrs.
Matthews' "company" china set on it and
then brought cold victuals from the pan
try and placed them on the table.
The meal appears to have been leisurely
eaten, and it is supposed the thieves must
have been in the house an hour or more.
The family were not disturbed, and not
till morning did they know that they had
such enterprising guests during the night.
The police j believe the burglars were per
sons who arc familiar with the premises.

CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 11.â Appellate
Court to-day. decided tha. famous elevator

Red Star steamer Rhynland. Twenty
thousand dollars' worth of gems was
secreted, and Captain Loeswitz, master of
the steamship, is charged with illegally
attempting to bring the diamonds into the
country, and a warrant for his arrest will
be issued to-morrow. . 7 7."')'
For , some time the "United States
treasury authorities have been convinced
that diamonds were being smuggled into
this country.- The Government - agents
abroad were instructed to investigate '-'tho
subject, and suspicion fell upon J Captain
Loeswitz.' When . the Rhynland lÂ«ft Ant
werp this trip the Government agents
abroad notified the Treasury Department
that they believed Captain. Loeswitz had
gems aboard his vessel which he intended
to illegally bring into this country.
Special Agent Cummings of New York
and Special Agent Gallen of Philadelphia
were detailed to await the Rhynland's ar
rival. When the steamship docked to-day
Agent Gallen went aboard, and going di
rectly to Captain Loeswitz's room informed
him that he wished him to deliver the box
that he had containing diamonds. Cap
tain Loeswitz at first demurred and ques
tioned the agent's right to demand them.
When threatened with immediate arrest
he delivered to Mr. Gallen a box contain
ing $20,000 worth of as fine diamonds as
have ever been brought to this country.; ':
The box was addressed to Herman, K^ck
__ Co., Cincinnati, one of the 7 largest im
porting jewelers in the country, and did
not appear upon the manifest of the steam
er's cargo.
The cems were taken possession of by
the treasury agents and. the steamer was
put under. guard. Captain Loeswitz will
be arrested to-morrbw. - Captain Loeswitz
has been in the service of the Red Star
line for many years and formerly com
manded the steamship Pennland.

Louisiana While Discussing
the Monroe Doctrine.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 11.â In the
Senate to day on motion of â¢ Hoar (R. ) of
Massachusetts it was ordered that on the
22d of February (Washington's birthday),
immediately after the reading of the jour
nal, Washington's farewell address be

Quay consented that his resolution for
the recommittal' of the i House tariff bill
should go over without action, so as not to

his purpose to ask the Senate to act upon
it then.
The bill as to distribution of seeds was
then taken up and Vest's substitute for it
was agreed to and the bill, as amended,
was passed without a division. It author
izes and directs the Secretary of Agricul
ture to purchase and > distribute valuable
seeds for the year 1896, as has been done
in preceding years. He is to procure the
seed by open , purchase or contract, and
shall not pay more for them than a rea
sonable and fair price. - "" .'-'" "~Xy >
, ! Blanchard (D.) of Louisiana addressed
the Senate on the subject of the Monroe
doctrine. He commended the President's
stand on the .Venezuelan, boundary, dis
pute and strongly urged that the doctrine
of Monroe be advanced to the dignity of a
rule of Governmental authority by affix
ing to an enlareed scope of , it the sanction
of legislative approval. Heretofore his
American policy had remained a mere
dictum of the executive. He insisted "that
the time ' had come when it should be
given a legal status by Congressional
declarationâ bold, comprehensive,
not made in temper nor menacing, but de
cisive. While his speech occupied ad
vanced ground- on this theme it was con
ceived in good temper and breathed a
spirit of peace and good will toward our
English cousins. He said, among other
things, that while the declarations of the
Monroe message i sprang . into being ,by
reason of the imminence of a peculiar
danger then A confronting this country,
which it was intended to meet and avoid,
it had still another purpose -to serve.
They were to furnish 'foundation of an
active policy in consonance with them, to
last for all \ time. 7. The message was not
merely a notice served at the time upon
the allied , powers of certain resistance to
be offered to the extension of their opera
tions to- this continent. It went .farther.
It posted a notice to endure as long as this
Government endured and to be taken ac
count of by all nations, that American
territory was- not to be the subject of
further conquest 'or " colonization by the
powers of the Old World.
"We endeavored to have these troubles
adjusted 'by arbitration," said Blanchard.
"That failing, we have appointed a com
mission to cetermine. the true boundary
line. This commission will complete its
work and will ascertain what is the true
eastern boundary line of Venezuela and
will definitely report to Congress and the
President. The line thus established will
be adopted by this Government as the true
boundary between Venezuela and British
Guiana, and Venezuela will acquiesce in
the same, withdrawing ; all pretension to
any territory east of the line. Thereafter
any crossing of this line by an armed force
for the purpose of holding or seizing terri
tory thus determined to be Venezuelan
would be held by us to be tantamount to a
declaration of war against both the United
States and Venezuela and would be re
sisted accordingly. . This 'is the inevitable
'logic of the position we have assumed. It
is the doctrine of America for Americans;
it is the 'balance of ' power' idea applied to
America; it is the assertion of the princi
ple that American questions are for Ameri
can decisions; the two English-speaking
races should be frank and sincere in their
dealings, their intercourse, their conten
tions, ore with . the ; other. Archdeacon
Farrar, in his address on General Grant at
Westminster Abbey, said : 'Whatever there
is between two nations to forget and for
give 'is ' forgotten . and forgiven.' In like
manner I say, wherever there is dispute
or contention between the two nations let
it be settled along lines of kindred, friend
ship and peace. >

message from the Presiden t on the subject
of the imprisonment in France of ex-Con
sul Waller of Madagascar was ' laid ' before
thÂ« Senate. '"_ â *' '-

marks in reply to criticisms of the ; Secre

Secretary was discharging his duties faith

Wolcott(R.) of Colorado broke in with
a "question; whether the Senator could

Allen contented himself with an explan
ation of the circumstances under which
the State ot Nebraska : had received more
than its quota of seeds in 1895. ;'7 7
Vest x took up X the question again and
proceeded to : ridicule ; the pretensions ,of
the Secretary of Agriculture and to show
up his inconsistency.
.Hale (R.) of , Maine, who desired to * pro
ceed with the urgent deficiency bill,' t said
that the Senate had to-day disposed of the
seed bill and that ; the discussion was now
over a caput mortuum. -
.7,' 'Does i; the ' .â  Senator â  mean," . Wolcott
asked, "to call the Secretary of Agriculture
a ' deadhead?" [Laughter.] "is should
like the Senator, from | Maine to give a - few
moments longer for a further investigation
of the subject." y X - 7.
Hale declined to' yield further, and the
urgent deficiency bill was taken np. : r
Alien (Pop.) 7 of; Nebraska f criticized
sharply the Senator from Maine and the
Committee on .Appropriations^ generally
for attempting' to control the proceedings
of the Senate. " ' ' r-
; Hale, : in - replying 'â  to Allen, said he was
anxious to get on with ; the bill. The Ap
propriations Committee .had not taken up.
the " time of j the Senate in an aggressive
manner, and' had not even asserted itself
during this whole session. 7 â ..Â«
The consideration of the bill was then
proceeded with. Attention was : called to
the fact that the amount included" in the
bill had been increased from about $4,250,
--000 to about $6,000,000, and considerable
discussion was had upon the habit of i the
House of Representatives -to . omit neces
sary appropriations and to leave them to
be put in by the Senate. 7 7 ;'
The discussion was interrupted in â¢". order
to allow Sherman (R.) of Ohio to offer a
resolution choosing Alonzo H. Stewart, of
lowa, one of -the Senate employes/as
assistant doorkeeper of the Senate, caused
by the death of Captain Isaac Bassett. An
amendment was offered by .7 Gorman (D.)
of Maryland, choosing Bernard 7W. Lay
ton of Ohio, also a Senate employe, as
acting assistant doorkeeper. The consid
eration of the resolution was objected to
by George (D.) of Mississippi, and it went
over till to-morrow. â ',:-
The consideration of the . urgent defi
ciency, bill was resumed, the ; discussion
going on as to the right and duties' of the
Senate on the subject of adding new items
to the appropriation bills.
An amendment authorizing the appoint
ment of twenty-five expert money, counters
in the Treasury outside of the civil service
rules led to a discussion *of tbe merits of
civil service examination " in y which Hale
explained that such examination could
not possibly touch the question of * the ex
pertness of money counters and suggested
satirically V. that since a member of the
commissionâ meaning Mr. Roosevelt â had
left that position, it was' found out that a
man or woman was able to do duty in the
departments without going ' before that
board. \ \
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska expressed his
gratification that the civil service law was
being .violated in its letter and 'spirit; oth
erwise he feared that in twenty years the.
public service of j the country would be in
the hands of a lot of "cigarette -smoking
dudes." Nevertheless he did ; not believe
the Secretary of the Treasury should be
given the power which the amendment
gave him. If the 'law were obnoxious it
should be made more so by being lived up
to. Two of the most gigantically, useless
institutions in'the country were the Civil
Service Commission and the Interstate
Commerce Commission. The latter was
as powerless as an infant to carry., out its
judgments and findings, and as to the
Civil Service 7V Commission; whenever a
member of it developed' the slightest
amount of backbone or independence he
heard a voice from the White House tell
ing him" that there was a vacancy in the
Civil Service Commission. . '
Wolcott (R.) . of Colorado broke into the
discussion with his usual vehemence and
, impetuosity. "The danger to this coun
try," he said, "is not through the Civil
Service Commission. It is through the
exercise by the executive and his Cabinet
of the power of removal and the power of
appointment which have been mercilessly
exercised in his , last administration. : as
never before in the history of the country.
In 1893 there never was a chance to prevent
the passage* of, a free ' silver measure
through the House of Representatives,
had it not been for the power of the patron
age of the administration and especially
the power of patronage; as exercised by
the Secretary of tbe Treasury.. Colorado is
to-day flooded with appointments, many
of them unlit ones, made by the Secretary
of . the Treasury for Congressmen who
'rated' on the silver question; men whose
constituents sent them here to vote for
silver and who; have gone back on their
pledges and promises to their constituents
because the ; administration has offered
them , patronage which '] has debauched
them and with which they," in turn, have
sought to debauch their constituents.
I tell you that whenever we reach
a - fair ' administration 7 of ; affairs ; in
this country it will be after we have de
prived the President of the United States
and unscrupulous Cabinet officials of the
power of degrading and dishonoring
manhood. I , look forward with great
pleasure to the time when civil service
rules shall be so extended that fitness and
fitness alone shall govern the appoint
ments to office and when public servants,
such as we, shall not be compelled to bang
about the doors of Cabinet offices, or 7to
attend the White House like servants, to
beg for our morsel of public patronage.
Gray (D.) of Delaware clapped bis hands
in approval of this speech, and Dodge (R.)
of Massachusetts followed with remarks in
the same line, - declaring 7 that 7 patronage
and favoritism were un-American and
were adverse to every American idea.
The system was utterlydegrading. :
The bill went over without any action
on the pending amendment. â l" - -
A conference report on the bill as to the
chaplaincy of 7 the West Point Military
Academy was presented and agreed to,
and the Senate, after an executive session,
at 5:25 adjourned until to-morrow.
CHARLES PHARES` CRIMES
Shot His Wife's Parents Before
Sending a Bullet Into
His Own Brain. -
Despondency the Cause of a Tragedy
That May Result in Four
Deaths. *
7 NEWTON, lowa, y" Feb. 11.-Charles
Phares shot and killed his mother-in-law,
Mrs. R. T. Smith, fatally 'shot his father
in-law and then put a* bullet into his own
brain, dying ' instantly,; at noon to-day.
Phares was a"] barber : who had lived for
several years at Atlantic, 7; borne months;
ago on account of \ failure to y get work he
and his wife came here 7to '. live ; with the
parents of Mrs. Phares, the Smith family.
For . several weeks he has been despond
ent and even threatened a few days ago
to kill himself. To-day he went down
town, returning at noon. He entered .' the
room where Mr. and Mrs. Smith were 'and
shot Mr. 4 Smith. Then, it is supposed, he
turned to Mrs. Smith and shot her in the
mouth. 7 The bullet entered her , brain and
she dropped dead. He then went : out in
front of the house and shot himself in tho
left temple, death resulting instantly. ":
Mr. Smith was not dead when neighbors
came to the scene, and for a time revived,
but he will die.
v When the news of the horrible deed was
conveyed to Mrs. Phares,, who was visit
ing in another part -of town, she fainted
and lias since been in a dangerous condi
tion. > Her recovery is t doubtful, 1 and it \is
probable it will be ; a tragedy with four
victims before the" end' is i reached. 7 Mr.
and Mrs. Phares had one child, a son four
years y old. They â  had \ lived comfortably i
together till his reverses caused) him to
become despondent.

AN I EVENING SESSION HELD.
De Armond of Missouri. Hurls Some
| Sarcasm -at Hall, His
Colleague.
' WASHINGTON, D. C Feb. 11.-Under
the arrangement made yesterday the Com
mittee on the Affairs of the District of
Columbia . had an 7 opportunity to-day to
clear the calendar of measures reported by
it. Under 7 the ; leaders hip of Chairman
Babcock (R.) of Wisconsin the House
passed the following bills: ;
? ; To incorporate the National University
(an old institution); to extend the time
within which the Maryland and Washing
ton railroad, (the new electric line joining
Baltimore and Washington) may be com
pleted; to regulate the issue of licenses to
billiard and poolrooms; to regulate ; the
trials before the 7 Metropolitan Fire and
Police boards to , authorize the reassess
ment of water-main taxes after being de
clared illegal by the District courts; to in
corporate ! and regulate, medical colleges
to regulate the practice of medicine and
surgery.
' The, remainder of the session was de
voted to the further discussion of the bond
silver-coinage bill.
De Armond (D.) of Missouri and Ogden
(D.) of Louisiana advocated unlimited
free coinage, 1 and Hill (R.) of Connecticut,
Lacey (R.) of 7 lowa, ana Burton (R.) of
Missouri .opposed it. The latter, however,
advocated the coinage of the silver bullion
in the treasury. r
7 A conference report on the bill to ap
point a chaplain at West Point Academy
was presented .by Hull (R.) of lowa, and
agreed to. *
A report was presented from the Commit
tee on Rivers and Harbors by Hooker ( R. )
of New York, and agreed to, calling : upon
the Secretary of War 7 for information in
his possession as to the cost and best plan
for constructing works at the outlet of
Niagara River, which will tend to raise
the level of water in 7 the great lakes, the
subsidence of which is now about five feet
below the normal, level.
Under the agreement made yesterday
the House proceeded to consider business
reported from the Committee on District
of Columbia,"- following which 'Hull (R.) of
lowa reported the conference agreement
on the bill to provide tor the appointment
of a chaplain <at West Point and it was
adopted. The 7 billy provides for the "- ap
pointment by the President of a chaplain
from either civil life or the list of army
chaplains for that station who shall re
ceive the salary of a mounted captain.
Consideration of the bond silver coinage
bill was then resumed in- committee of the
whole. - Hill (R.) of Connecticut opposed
the Senate free-coinage substitute. He
said the matter of free coinage of silver
was for the Democracy, to settle. Free
coinage would not be an issue" this year ex
cept in the Democratic National Conven
tion and there it would be crushed to
death 7in one more dying struggle for
spoils and place.
De Armond (D.)' of Missouri, rising to
support, the Senate substitute, paid s his
compliments at Some length, and with
scarcely veiled sarcasm . to his colleague
(Hall) for bis change of position on his
question, as announced in the latter's
speech on Saturday. He said if the gen
tleman had before making that speech, in
which he said that the trouble with the
people was aue to the cowardice of the
politicians, gone to the people of the Sec
ond District of Missouri and surrendered
his commission because he could no longer
represent them -on the platform upon
which they 'had sent him to Congress he
would have given an exhibition of courage
that all men could have admired. But he
would hardly have been his own successor.
Discussing the matter of consistency,
De Armond suggested that men ought not,
when one of their fellows -announces: a
change of opinion and consequent course
of â  conduct, at once jump to the conclu
sion, therefore, that he has soared to a
position above: the heads of the mass of
his fellow-beings, when a little investiga
tion might prove that he had fallen below
the level which the average mass of ' man
kind ' y occupies. ** Other , speakers were
Lacey. (R.) of lowa and Burton . (R.) of
Missouri in opposition to the Senate sub
stitute, and Ogden (D.) of Louisiana in
favor of it.
. At 5:30 the committee rose, y. and ' the
House, on' motion "of Dingley (R.) "of
Maine, took a recess until 8 o'clock.
7 The debate upon . the bond - free 7 coinage
bill'at the evening â¢ session was ' devoid of
usual interest. Harris (R.) of Ohio, Brown
(R.). of X- Tennessee, Ho wey (R.)" of *â ; New.
York and Fowler : (R.) of New ' Jersey ,"
spoke .in opposition :to ; free coinage of
silver, and Otey (D.) of , Virginia 7 ana
baker (P.) of Kansas," in its favor.* '
C. W. Slope (R.) of Pennsylvania, with a
prefatory "statement that advocates of free
coinage were prone to quote the condition
of Japan as evidence of the prosperity that
attended the use of silver as standard
money, : sent to the desk and had read a
paragraph in a recent letter from Tokio to
the New, York Herald written by John A.
Cockerill, to the effect that so far from be
: ing prosperous,' Japan was on the verge of
: a season of ; depression and bard times. .
v.; At 10 o'clocK a further recess was 7 taken
by the House until 10:30 to-morrow morn

CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 11.â The pros
pects for holding the National Grand
Army encampment in St. Paul were con
siderably brightened to-day by the action
of the Wisconsin Central Railroad, which
has taken position with the Chicago Great
Western in favor of giving the ; thirty-day
limit asked by the Grand Army com
mander-in-chief ana the citizens of St-
Paul. General Passenger Agent Pond of
the Wisconsin Central, at the special
meeting of the Chicago-St. Paul lines held
to-day in Chairman Caldwell's office, gave
the " other officials to understand, after
they had failed to take any action modify
ing their agreement of several weeks ago,
that his road would take advantage of its
rights under the association agreement to
ask relief from the chairman. This is the
prescribed course which was taken by the
Great Western previous to giving the ten
days' notice that it would take inde
pendent action. 7;Hryy
When Mr. Pond made this announce
ment at tbe meeting the other agents de
cided to take no further action pending
another conference. As the meeting was
called at the request of the Northwestern
and the Minneapolis and St. Louis | roads
the sentiment is general in railroad cir
cles that those roads will be the ; next to
join the minority. Commander Walker
said when here â¢ that if two roads would
agree to the thirty days he would keep
the encampment in St. Paul, and tbe Wis
consin Central is believed to have supplied
the wedge which will drive the competing
roads into line. Representatives of St.
Paul and the Grand Army waited outside
the meeting room and were highly pleased
at the news. All that is lacking is a road
that touches Omaha.

-
TOKIO, Japan, Jan. 3aâ opposition
House of"Representatives have marshaled
themselves oh a new J platform. Knowing
the country's strong desire for a large in
crement of national armament they stand
forth as champions of a measure far more
comprehensive even than that contem
plated by I the Government. j The latter
proposes to devote the sum of 81,000,000
yen to the building of new men-of-war
during the first term of the naval increase,
and a further sum, the amount of which
is not yet stated, to the same purpose dur
ing the second period, so that, by the end
of 1906. the additions made. to the navy
would consist of four-line-of- battle ships,
four first-class cruisers, three second-class
cruisers, , two third-class cruisers and a
large number of torpedo-boats and torpedo
destroyers.
..This programme the opposition pro
poses to practically double and further de
vote the whole of . the necessary money at
once, so as to greatly hasten the comple
tion of ships. The ; subject will come up
for discussion by the Diet in a few days,
when an animated debate may be ex
pected. ._>,. \<iX..\ â¢';
The Korean Government seems to be
about to pay its current expenses by in
creasing its debts. It proposes to raise tbe
foreign loan of 3,000,000 yen at 4 per cent
interest, hypothecating the customs. duties
as security, the loan to be repaid in twenty
annual installments, commencing, from
1896. The Government further contem
plates the building of a railway from
Seoul to Ninsen at a cost of 2,000,000 yen,
which also is to be borrowed on the . se
curity of the railway.
The transfer of the Kiangnan arsenal,
near Shanghai, from the control of the
Viceroy of Nanking, the great Chang, to
that of the Peking Minister of War has
furnished an illustration of the power
wielded by Chinese provincial officials.
Chang, resenting the change as an indirect
reflection on his own administrative facul
ties, at once telegraphed the Minister of
War that since he was thenceforth to* man
age the arsenal he proposed using for o titer
purposes the sum. of 1,000,000 . taels, hit.
erto paid annually, out of the local ex
chequer for the support of the arsenel.
The Ministry had no reply except to re
store the arsenal to its former control.
The thieves that have for some time
been stealing quantities of valuable porce
lains, antique and modern, from the por
celain storehouse of : the imperial house
bold department in Peking, have been ar
rested, as have also been the receivers of
the stolen goods. Upon all these culprits,
as well as upon the officials who had
charge of the storehouse, the imperial
wrath has fallen. Meanwhile it is proba
ble that the incident has enriched some of
the fine American collections.
Although Viscount Miura, the Japanese
ex-Minister to Seoul, has 7 been released by
preliminary tribunal at Hiroshima on the
ground of insufficient evidence, the finding
of the court shows clearly that he not only
contemplated, but also instigated the mur
der of the Queen of Korea.

VARIOUS SCHEMES SUGGESTED.
It Is Evident, However, That the Con

ert or in Mexico.
EL PASO, Tex., Feb. 11.â The situation I
two days before the time set for the open- !
ing of the long heralded carnival of sport
shows need of the application of Professor
Rontgen's cathode rays in order that the
public may be enlightened. Governor
Culberson says "No fight in Texas"; At
torney-General Harmon puts it, "Hands
off New Mexico." Governor Hughes has
his army ready to prevent an invasion of
Arizona, while Governor Ahumada of Chi
huahua remains non-committal, although
President Diaz has pronounced against
the fight.
A delegation from the Ministers' Union
of El Paso had an audience with the Mexi
can Governor this afternoon, and although
they talked a full hour they failed to gain
from Senor Ahumada the promise that the
Federal authorities would try to prevent
the fight.
This was a decided setback for the oppo
sition and filled the fighters' camp with
joy. Dan Stuart smiled significantly and
proceeded to sell tickets as fast as he could
deal them out. His stereotyped words,
"The fights will take place on schedule
time," was all the information given out
by the sphinx-like*; Dallas capitalist, and
an analysis of the situation would indi
cate that he will keep his word. The fight
or art least the big oneâ will, it is confi
dently believed, take place on Mexican
soil about twenty miles from Juarez Fri
day morning.
Fitzsimmons, his training finished, came
to town this afternoon and placed himself
in the hands of his trainer. Maher will be
here to-morrow. Both men are in perfect
form, although Maher is four or five'
pounds heavier than his opponent. Fitz
simmons says he will win beyond a doubt,
and expects to do the trick in five rounds.
Maher is equally confident, but does not
venture anything on the length of the
contest. At midnight bets of 10 to 1 were
offered that the fight would take place on
Mexican soil.
There was a secret conference to-night
between the Governor, United States Mar
shal Hall of New Mexico and Adjutant-
General _f abry ~of - the Texas . Rangers.
*_.'his conference was in the nature of a
council of war, and it is - certain that the
details of the campaign were outlined.
It was , reported to-night tnat Fitz
simmons sparred his training-master, Mc-
Coy, in a private room in Juarez late this
evening, and that among those present
was Governor Miguel Ahumada of Chihua
hua, who is on the border to stop the
fi.ht. ['-y Xy
Consul Buford, the American represen
tative at Juarez, thinks the Fitzsimmons-
Maher fight will take place. He so de
clared- in an interview to-day. What ac
tion he will take he declined to say, but
admitted that he had received instructions
as to what he was to do in the event that
the pugilists attempted to meet in the ring.
"I believe that the big fight will take
place," the Consul said with an air of
confidence, "but I shall not see it. I
might were the conditions concerning me
here different. I have received instruc
tions from Washington. They are, of
course, secret and I am not at liberty to
talk. lam convinced, however, that the
fight will take place."
NOT IN ARIZONA, SAYS HUGHES.
Militia of the Territory Held in Readi
ness to Act.
PHOENIX, Aeiz., Feb. 11.â Ed Schwartz,
adjutant-general of Arizona, by command
of Governor Hughes, issued a special order
that the six militia companies at Phoenix,
Tempe, Mesa, Tucson and two at Yuma
: hold themselves in readiness to move at a
moment's notice. Twenty rounds of am
munition was issued to "each company,
and commanders were ordered to report
immediately their probable â¢ strength.
This order was issued to prevent the pos
sibility of the knuckle carnival coming off
on Arizona soil. :
A rumor is current that the rolling stock
of the Santa Fe at El Paso will be held to
carry all to the east edge of Arizona, leav
ing El Paso at 1 o'clock Friday, the fight
to begin at 6 o'clock Friday morning.
; Governor Hughes to-day communicated
to the authorities at Washington, and
says that regular troops will be on the
Arizona line to prevent the fight, backed
by the Arizona militia.
A number of Deputy Sheriffs will leave
in the morning for No-rales in order to
prevent any raid upon that place. Cer
tainly if Dan Stuart attempts to pull off
the fight in this Territory he will have his
hands full. ."â '.' 7 . .
! The only possible chance to do this is to
run the train out of El Paso in the" night
and after crossing the Arizona line stop
somewhere in the desert and .light it out
before the troops or authorities can reach
them. This will probably be done, as the
local sports 'are all wearing a careless
smile. Gus Hirschfeld, Dan Stuart's
Phoenix lieutenant, received a telegram
from the latter to-day. He will 7 not di
vulge its contents, but when asked if .all j
arrangements .were completed and if the
fi.ht .was a dead sure thing, replied
affirmatively, and offered to back , Stuart's
$30,000 bet with $10,000. more. Wherever
it occurs, however, two Pullmans have
been chartered to carry a Phoenix crowd
to the scene. '.^__E_3B&f_^ :â '"'.
FOR LACK OF EQUITY.
Dismissal of the Case, of Mr. and Mrs.
â -. Stiles. â  ' /'"[/' - â ':
CHICAGO, 111.. Feb. ILâ An opinion
was handed down to-day. by the Appellate
Court affirming the decision 7of i Judge
Ewing in the famous Stiles-Crane divorce

Carter case;' The bills filed by Mr. and
Mrs." Stiles against each other are dismissed
for lack of equity. The original bill tiled 1

by Mr. Stiles, and interprets them as the
creation of an innocent, platonic love.
PRIVATES AS /P/Riz E-FIGHTERS.
Officers of. the Army Probably Had , a
Hand in. the Omaha Mill. //'â¢.,
OMAHA, Nebr., Feb. 11. â Privates
Cavanaugh and Murphy were arrested at
Omaha yesterday for prize-fighting, and
100 others who witnessed the fight expect
to be ordered to the guardhouse. -
It has been stated and -generally cred
ited that the two ; men fought for a purse
furnished by the officers at the fort. 7 This
is most emphatically denied by Colonel
Bates. While he has no doubt that there
was a purse in sight, he says he is sure it
was not made up by the officers. That is
another point to be cleared up and light
will be obtained, if possible, from the two
prisoners when the court-martial con
venes. ;/ XX-XX-X. -â¢-
It is stated by the officers that there
need be no surprise if the guardhouse is
stored full of prisoners in a short time. A
very determined effort is being made to
learn who were present at the mill, and if
the discovery be made all the soldier
spectators will be arrested. The United

BISHOP BONACUM BEATEN.
Ordered to Cease the. Prosecution of Two
Popular Priests.
OMAHA, Nebk., Feb. 11.â long war
between Bishop Bonacum of the Roman
Catholic diocese of Lincoln and Fathers
Murphy and Fitzgerald of Tecumseh and
Auburn has ended in the complete defeat
of the Bishop. He some time ago removed
these priests from their parishes and later
expelled and excommunicated them and
all those who dared to worship with them.
They fought him in the civil courts and
were allowed to retain possession of the
churches.
Now Bishop Bonacum has announced to
their attorneys that he has withdrawn all
suits and proceedings against them, as he
had been overruled by "a higher ecclesias
tical court." As the matter was appealed
to Archbishop Hennessy and Cardinal
Satolli, it is supposed that the decision
came from Satolli. This victory of the
priests will be a very popular one, as nine
tenths of their parishioners clung to them
throughout.
QUEEN VICTORIA'S
SPEECH READ,
Continued from First Page.
much as it introduced into the question
the important element of a solid substan
tial government offering to guarantee the
permanence of any settlement that might
be arrived at. He welcomed with infinite
joy the indications in the speech from the
throne that.there have been communica
tions between Great Britain and the
United States in the direction .of an
equitable arrangement. Two things might
be heartily welcomed as the outcome of
the difficulty with the United States. The
first was the unbounded expression of
loyalty, by Canada [cheers], and the.
second the serious movement on both
sides in favor of permanent machinery, by
which questions referrable to arbitration
could be dealt with without loss of dignity!
or impairment of the sovereign rights of
either. [Cheers.] '77f.--777
Prime Minister Salisbury followed Lord
Rosebery. He said -he concurred with
Lord Rosebery that the mingling of the
United States in the Venezuelan question
might, from some points of view, conduce
to desirable results. He did not think the
invoking of the Monroe doctrine was con
troversially quite unnecessary. Considering
the position of Venezuela in the Carib
bean Sea it was no more unnatural that
the United States should take an interest
in the matter than Great Britain should
take an interest in Holland and Belgium,
and from that point of view he trusted that
the negotiations would continue. It was
obviously undesirable to state at present
the conditions of the negotiations, but he
had had an increasing belief during the
last few weeks that, although perhaps after
long negotiations, a satisfactory settlement
would be found, and that all danger of a
rupture of the relations between the two
nations would be entirely " removed.
[Cheers.] " .
He did not wish the House to think
that an agreement had yet been arrived
at. He thought it rightly relied upon the
question of arbitration. The United States
attached a more unrestricted value upon
this method of adjusting differences than
had heretofore been done in England.; He
concurred with Lord ' Rosebery - that the
proposal which, at the will of an arbitrator,
might hand over 40,000 British subjects to
Venezuela could not be accepted, but he
believed that means might be found, by
combining negotiations and arbitration,
to effect a settlement. The great obstacle
to a settlement had been the extravagant
claims of Venez when she treated the
whole country as far as the Essequibo as
undeniably hers and then broke off diplo
matic relations with Great : Britain. But
for that he believed the difficulty would
have been solved Jong ago.
He agreed that the mutual development
of the desire for arbitration was satisfac
tory. He thoifght it impossible to adopt
arbitration unless restricted to subject
matter and conditions, but between the
extremes of handing everything to arbi
tration and the former practice of using
too little, he fully believed there was a ;
middle term which would effectually di
minish the chances of a conflict anent dif
ferences of opinion. [Cheers.]
Lord Salisbury rebutted Lord Rosebery's
criticisms of tbe Government's Armenian
policy. He said he defied anybody to dis
cover in the treaties or in his own speeches
a promise or threat that Great Britain
would war against the Sultan unless he
governed better. . He lengthily defended
the Government's policy on the lines of
the speech delivered by him January 31, at
the meeting of Nonconformist' Unionists,
in which lie ascribed the atrocities in Ar
( menia to the passions of race and creed. c
He ' believed that the Sultan's Govern
ment was wretched, and impotent, but
there was no ground for imagining that
the Sultan had instigated the massacres'.
England lacked the power to do the only
thing necessary y" to -'. end the troubles,
namely to militarily occupy the -Turkish
provinces. 'â 'â¢ Patience must be exercised,
and the Sultan given time to enforce the
; reforms he had promised. - f
. The Duke of 'Argyll gave* notice that he
would at an '.'early date call the attention
of 7 the House to Great Britain's obliga
!tions in" regard to Turkey, and would sub
mit recommendations as to the course she
ought to pursue.
.... The address in . reply to the : Queen's
speech was agreed toby- the House of
Lords.

PASADENA, Cal., Feb. 11. â Judge
Cody, father-in-law of the lost Mrs. Grace
Goodrich Cody of ; Chicago, who disap
peared from Tacoma on Friday, December
31, was seen by a Call correspondent at
his residence on Palmetto drive this morn
ing, and could throw no further "light
upon the mystery. The story as gener
ally published is correct, so far as he has
heard, and every clew made known to the
family has thus far proved illusive.
During the interview the little daugh
ters of the unfortunate woman were taken
Mrs. Grace Goodrich Cody, for Whom , a Futile Search Has Been Conducted for
Weeks.
[From a recent photograph.]
from the room, the eldest being a charm
ing little blonde of about 7 years, who has
as yet been kept in ignorance of her
mother's disappearance. Judge Cody said
that the only possible explanation to the
family is that Mrs. Cody suddenly became
insane. She had everything to live for
and was a happy wife and mother, with a
naturally bright disposition.
The members of. the family are com
pletely prostrated with anxiety, and their
only hope is that Mrs. Cody, attracted by
the thought of her children in Pasadena,
may have made some effort to reach this
place. Detectives are employed in watch
ing* all boats* from the north reaching
ports in connection with Los Angeles.
Judge Cody expressed considerable doubt
that his ' daughter-in-law had any consid
erable sum of money with her and, while
attempting to keep up hope, he fears she
will never be found living.
CONTINUING THE SEARCH.
Tacoma Officials Are Now Confident That
Mrs. Cody la Alive.
TACOMA,. Wash., Feb. 11.â The search
for news of the missing Mrs. Arthur B.
! Cody continues under much the same con-
I ditions as during the past few days, and an
i inquiry this evening elicited the response
| that nothing of importance' had yet been
' learned/ The theory of suicide, which was
| at first supposed to be the correct one, is
now generally admitted to have been
wrong, and that Mrs. Cody is alive and
in hiding from her relatives, while suffer
ing from mental weakness, is believed to
be the true condition of affairs. The Chief
of Police expresses his views as follows:
"I first made up my mind that there was
a strong probability of suicide and a bare
possibility of her having left the city, but
since our search I am convinced that just
the ; reverse is 7 true. There is now a faint
( possibility of suicide and a strong proba
j bility that she has gone away and is still
alive."
This seems to be also the opinion of the
J husband of Mrs. Cody, and it is upon this
I theory that the search i 3 at present being
i pushed in alp directions outside the city.
j There is not a town or way station on the
i j coast that Mrs.' Cody could have passed or
stopped at but that ber description and a
' notice of reward / has been â¢ sent, - and, if
she is still alive, the chances are strongly
favorable 'to 7 locating Per within a few
days. Her relatives and the. officers are
strong in the belief that the search in the
city and surrounding 'country, has been
such as to prove positively! that 7 her body
is not in ground -gone over, if Mrs. Cody
did kill herself. .It is this fruitless search
that brings about the opinion '.tnat she is

charge of obstructing the sidewalk. A
large crowd followed the seven officers who
arrested her to the police station, hooting
and howling. She was placed in the re

In the meantime the crowd at the police
station continued to grow and increase.
It was a quiet and peaceable mob. Some
fifteen or twenty officers were among them
in r* citizens' clothing. No attempt was
made to do violence. Finally $25 bail was
deposited for Mrs. Rice: and she was re

Mrs. Rice held a : , meeting : early in the
evening that drew a large audience. She
spoke in the very heart of the business

POINT WILSON'S WRECK
It Is Believed the Kilbrannan Can
Be Floated When 'the Tide
Is High.
The Stranded Vessel Is Badly Dam
aged and Its Hold Is Filled.
With Water.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. 11.â
The British ship Kilbrannan, which went
ashore in a squall at Point Wilson on the
morning of January 6, is still there, its
condition being unchanged since it swung
around broadside onto the shingle beach.
The vessel will not sustain further injury
unless an unusually heavy storm* comes on.
Since the recent unsuccessful attempt
by seven tugs to float it the time has been
taken up removing ballast, tanks and mov
able rigging. There are several holes in
view in the vessel's bottom, but as she lies
on her port bilge the full extent of the
damage cannot be ascertained. There is
five feet of water in the hold - but the
pumps aboard are sufficient to keep this
down.
On the 14th inst. another, attempt will
be made to float the Kilbrannan. An im
mense wrecking pump 1 is here ready to
work as soon as the vessel is floated again.
There is five feet of sand to seaward, but
; with the removal of all the extra weight
this will not interfere with the work of
floating the ship. If this effort fails it is
possible that a dredger will be used to
make a channel. ' All competent authori
ties agree that the vessel can 7 be floated, if
not now, easily with , the big tides of May
and June. If the next attempt to float it
succeeds the vessel will be taken to Esqui- i
malt and docked for repairs.

CHANGE IN THE LAW ADVISED.
He Will Recommend That the Legis
â  lature Pass a Bill ' Embodying
His Views.
STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. 11.â Governor
Budd to-day denied very emphatically
that he had made a statement .that the
Bank - Commissioners would shortly re
scind their order directing that no publio
money should be placed in banks except
on special deposits. ;He says, however,
that he will recommend to the next Legis
lature that it change the existing law so as
to permit the county boards of Supervis
ors to let the county funds out to banks
which bid the highest for the privilege of
using them. The bonds which , the Gov
ernor says he would have the banks fur
nish to secure the county against loss
would be gilt-edged county, city, State 1 or
National bonds. The bankers could be
drawing the interest on these bonds and
at the same time be loaning out the county
money. They could, . therefore, afford to
pay the county for its use, and in hia
opinion there would be no danger of loss
to the county. â¢ â¢
7 "I hold," said Governor Budd, "that the
banks should be given the privilege of
using the money if they pay for it. They
could give ample bonds to secure the
county against loss. They could put up
Government bonds, for that matter. That
would put the money in circulation, and
the county. would be perfectly safe." ' , '.r.
Referring to his widely reported conver
sation with County Treasurer Kerrick of
this county, the Governor said :
"KerricK wanted to know what he would
have to do in the meantime. He said it
had been suggested that a $6000 vault be
built to hold the county funds, and I told
him it would not be right to tax the people
of this county any such sum to build a
vault.
"It would be cheaper to hire two reliable
guards until such time as the law was
changed rather than to go to any such ex
pense. If all I said had been reported there

MASONS CONDUCT THE SERVICE.
Three Veterans of the Mexican War
View the Interment of
Their Comrade.
BANTA CRUZ, Cal., Feb. 11. â The
funeral of John Daubenbiss this afternoon
at Soquel attracted the largest assemblage
.of people that has ever gathered at such
a solemn event in Santa Cruz County.
The people who attended were personally
acquainted with the deceased and came
from Watsonville, Santa Cruz, Capitola,
Aptos, Boulder Creek, Feltonâ in fact,
from all over the countyâ and numbered
about 500.
The introductory services, conducted
by Rev. Mr. Snyder of the Soquel Congre
gational Church, were under the auspices
of the Masons, the Pioneers and the Na
tive Sons, accompanied by the Naval Re
serve of this city, the veterans of the
Mexican War and school children of
Soquel. At the grave the Masonic service
was delivered as well as that of the Pio
neers.
The Mexican veterans, who served with
Daubenbiss under General Fremont, were
only three in number â Trout,
James Tait and Charles Steinmetz. They
are very old men and represent the rem
nant of this county of those pioneer sol
diers. The pall-bearers were chosen from
the Pioneers, the Native Sons and the
Masons.
Some of the old men who followed the
body to the grave had crossed the plains
with Mr. Daubenbiss.
DROWNED â  BEFORE ITS OTHER.
A Child Carried Out to Sea Before
Reached by Aid.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Feb. 11.â Marietta
Reed, 10 years old, daughter of I. B. Reed
of Fresno, was washed off the beach at
Lighthouse Point this afternoon and car
ried to sea.
The mother was at the same time car
' ried out by the waves, but being stronger
and comprehending the situation better
managed to save herself. ; She shouted to
the child, endeaving to encourage her and
advise her, but the breakers made such a
roar that the girl evidently did not hear
her mother's voice. â¢ .
Mrs. Reed clung to a projecting rock
and escaped death by that mere chance,
while the waves broke over her. She was
so shocked by the sight of her child being
carried out to death that she did not real
ize her own danger until she had been
aided by some men near by and dragged
out to a safe place on tbe beach.
Mr. Reed had left his wife and child
only a few minutes before to return* to a
new camping place on the opposite side of
the town, on the bank of the San Lorenzo
! River. They had spent the day getting
clams, as hundreds of people do, and Mr.
Reed believed his wife and child were safe
enough and knew the dangers of the
; waves. The little girl was the eldest of
three children. The family came here
: direct from Fresno, whence they had come
from Millerville, Cloud County, Kans.
The little girl who was drowned had been
occupied recently selling candies on the
street here. Her body has not yet been
recovered.

SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Feb. 11.â The

dozen or more fishermen. Yesterday the
number of boats increased and 200 fish

WARRING SAN JOSE HEIRS.
Louis Chynoweth's Children
Carry Their Quarrel Into
the Courts.
Mrs. Aurelia Robertson Sues to Com
pel a- Division of the Dece
dent's Estate.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. Feb. 11.â The suit of
James E. and Aurelia Robertson against
Ellen C Lyon, Emily Chynoweth and J.
V. Lawrence to have 100 acres of land near
Edenvale partitioned, commenced â¢in
Judge Lorigan's court this morning. The
land is planted to fruit and worth about
$60,000. .-â  â¢ . â¢â  . Â' â¢â -;
. The property adjoins the ' Hayes-Chyno
weth mansion at Edenvale, and | that
numerous family were in full attendance
in court. The whole matter is somewhat
complicated. Louis Chynoweth died in
1892, and deeded the property to his three
children â Aurelia Robertson, Ellen C.
Lyon and -Emily Chynoweth. Aurelia
Robertson claims one-third of the prop
erty. She avers that since her father s
death in 1892 she has received only $45
from the land ana has had no voice in the
management of it, and for this reason she
wants the property divided. , ~'X-'X:Xx'X.fX
The defendants in answering assert that
the deed was not intended to be of any
effect except as a means of security for
debts between the parties, and at the
death of Chynoweth. was to have been
void. Under this contention the defend
ants claim that the property involved be
longs to the estate of Chynoweth and
should go through the process of probate
with the other effects of Chynoweth and
be distributed among the heirs.
J. V. Lawrence is made a party to the
suit by reason of $16,000 mortgage he has
on the property.
Several witnesses were examined to-day,
and the case went over until to-morrow.

Recorder.
BONDSMEN IN TROUBLE.
Gil P. Hall's Sureties Are Given
Five Days in Which to
Settle.
DECLARES HE IS INNOCENT.
The Accused Man : - Confident That He
Can Prove His CaseâOther
Officials Under Fire.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. 11.â Professor
C. H. Neilson, the expert hired by the
Grand Jury of Sonoma County to investi
gate the books of some of the, county
officials, made a report to that body. yes
terday. The , report has not ' been ' made
public as yet, but rumors are flying thick
and fast, and sensational developments
are looked for every hour.
It has just leased out that the Board of
Supervisors on last Saturday adopted a
resolution in which it was set forth that
Gilbert P. Hall, ex- Auditor and Recorder
of this county, was $5000 short in his ac
counts, and directing the District Attor
ney to make a formal demand -upon Mr.
Hall for the return of the money. The
resolution and order further provided that
if the sum was not paid over to the Treas
urer of Sonoma County within , five days
suit would be commenced against the
bondsmen of the ex-Recorder.
An examination of the Treasurer's books
from May, 1890, to December, 1895, show
ing the amounts turned in monthly by
the several Recorders during that period
shows that the fees of the office during the
time of Hall's administration were not
regularly paid over to the Treasurer as
provided by law. It ,is but fair to state,
however, that other county officials were
often, likewise delinquent.. On two occa
sion s|the fees were retained by the Recorder
for six consecutive months.
Expert Neilson has been working on the
Recorder's books for sixty days, being
greatly handicapped by the mysterious
disappearance of fee book No. 13. This
was opened for entries on January 1, 1892,
and closed November 1, -: 1894, covering
nearly two years of the time in which the
alleged crookedness was going on. As the
missing book was a large volume of about
16x24 inches, five inches thick and weigh
ing twenty-five or thirty pounds, it seems
impossible for anyone to have carried it
away without the knowledge of those in
charge. Owing to; the absence of this
book Professor Neilson was obliged to ex
amine the record of each instrument sepa
rately to ascertain if the proper fees for re
cording had been paid. â  It is stated here
by competent : authority that the errors
and mischarges abound throughout the
records during the years 1893 and 1894,
, The expert's report is also said to deal
: with the accusation made against. the ex-
Recorder of overcharging the county for
recopying old records. The records of
the county show th at Mr. Hall was paid
$3800 for such work during, his two terms
of office. -7 â¢â¢
The accused official was elected to the
combined office of Auditor and Recorder
of Sonoma County on the Democratic
ticket at the fall election in 1890, taking
charge of the office in January, 1891. He
gave a bond for $30,000 at the beginning of
his second term with the following sureties :
W. A. Lewis, $15,000; Dan Brown, $15,000;
M. McNamara, $10,000; A. J. Shaw, $5000;
J. M. Bowles, $5000; Philip Cowen, $5000;
,0. Pothlmann, $5000.
Gil P. Hall is well known throughout
this county, having been raised in Peta
luma, and has hosts of friends, some of
the most intimate .of whom declare that
Mr. Hall will prove his innocence of any
wrongdoing. .. In an interview to-day, Mr.
Hall said: "':..-,
y, '.'As' board has seen fit to bring suit
'against my * bondsmen for $5000, it is
hardly proper for me to make any state
ment at present, but in justice to myself
and friends I will say that had I been
guilty of the misappropriation of the funds
of the county I could have refunded the
money, as the opportunity was presented
to me to do so, and I think I will be able
to vindicate myself when the proper time
comes." XX". X 1
As Mr. Hall .is the son-in-law .of Dan
Brown of Petaluma, one of Sonoma Coun
ty's wealthiest men, and has many other
wealthy friends and relatives, this state
ment finds ready, belief with many.
PIERCE WILL CONTEST.
Heirs of Sarah 'C. Pierce Fighting for
Her Estate.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. 11.â case
of 'John E. Jewell 7et al. vs. Mary Jane
Pierce et al. came up for trial in the Supe
rior Court to-day. . The suit was ostensibly
brought ' to', obtain possession of certain
lots in Petaluma, the property in dispute
being part of the estate of Will S. Pierce,
the Petaluma' capitalist who was killed by
a live wire last spring. But the real inter
est involved, and the. point upon which an
adjudication is desired, is a construction
of the will of Sarah :C. Pierce. This gave
to Will' 1 8. Pierce almost 'â¢ all of an estate
valued ;at $100,000. The will provided,
however, that in the event of the death of
Will S. Pierce -Â without . issue the estate
should be distributed to the old; lady's
heirs according to statute.
V When Will S. Pierce died he left a will,
leaving . his property to his mother, Mary
Jane Pierce. Vi Now the heirs of "Grandma"
Pierce are trying; ;to get possession of the
property as provided: by .. the first will. H.

/ CINCINNATI, Ohio, Feb. 11.â Nothing

brought in by , two â  colored girlsâ tend"

Walling although he .failed to 7 place
Jackson. â¢""
Wilson said one of the men had a valise.
After standing some time together, talk
ing, the girl apparently disagreeing with
the two men, all three went to the Lamar
House.7 Minnie Johnson and Annie Lee,
two colored girls having rooms at 418 East
Front street, saw * three -men 7 under | thÂ«
Newport bridge at Broadway. % One carried
a valise';.-.' One of the ' men accosted them
and asked where j they I were going. 7, They
said they were going home and invited
the men to go with them.
-' "I want to wash up," said one. "Let's
go." , . -7 :
Two then went with the girls, but the
man with the valise remained. While the
men were washing up the women observed
blood on the arms and sleeves of one and
that a shirt sleeve of one, was missing. In
the jail the women were sure that Walling
and Jackson are the two men who made
the call. ;
WALLER TO IBE RELEASED.
But the United States Will Not Demand
â¢ Damages. /
WASHINGTON, D. C, . Feb. 11.â
President sent to Congress to-day a long
report from Secretary Olney, together
with all the correspondence, in the case
of Waller,: ex- United; States Consul to
Tamatave, who is ' now confined in a'
French prison under conviction for trea
son.
Secretary Olney says . that Waller - was
unquestionably guilty and that the pen
alty inflicted was exceedingly moderate.
The French Government ' had made *an
offer to release Waller from further im
prisonment / and pardon his offense on
condition that the affair thereby termin
ated as between the two Governments and
that the United States should make no
claim for damages in behalf of the ex-
Consul based on his arrest, conviction and
imprisonment.
Embassador Eustis, it appears from the
correspondence, was instructed to give
notice to the French Government of the
acceptance of the conditions, and to ex
change the notes necessary to carry out
the arrangement. Waller, however, acting
under the advice of his wife and brother
in-law, had not consented to this arrange
ment, and insists that he shall receive
compensation. 'y
He charged ill treatment while being
taken from Madagascar to France. Olney
says that if ne desired to resort to action
in the French courts Embassador Eustis
could furnish security, and there would be
nothing to stand in the way of tbe offer of
the French Government for his immediate
release. Eustis was instructed to 7 furnish
Waller with the means yto 7 reach the
United States should he desire to come.

and Southern Pacific railroad companies.
' When Congress appointed its Committee
on Pacific and Aided Roads in 1886 its in
tention was to look up just such lax
methods of business which threatened the
interests of the United States Government
in the claims it held against the roads.
.Commissioner Pattison, who was chair
man of the committee, after a careful in
vestigation made a report of the doings of
the railroad magnates at the head of the
Central and Southern roads which should
preclude any extension of an indebted
ness. 'â¢ "â  ' â¢ '"-"*'.â¢:'"
It is commonly understood on the
Pacific Coast that the SO.OOO Copies of the
Pattison report printed at the expense of
the Government have disappeared from
the shelves of the public and private
libraries of the United States. That they
have been bought; up by the Huntington
factions is no loneer a question. Still a
few volumes are left in the hands of the
State < Library and Mayor Sutro, from
which T_e Call has been able to get ex
tracts from time to time.
These '* excerpts have already pointed
out many of the misdeeds of the Southern
Pacific and the Central Pacific in respect
to their violation of confidence with the
State of California and the United States,'
but as yet the pithy portion of the Patti
son report has not been given. It is as a
conclusion of the voluminous report to
President Cleveland to be transmitted to
Congress that it says: :â¢;' 777 y ;
What should the Government do? A mere
money recovery is the least of benefits it should
consider in deciding upon its course di action.
To redeem these roads from the perverted uses
to which they have been applied in order that
the beneficent public purpose Congress had in
view in. their (Creation may be realized is a ;
consideration of infinitely greater importance
to the people than a repayment of a number of:
dollars and cents into the. treasury. The Gov
ernment can well afford to lose a portion of
this indebtedness if this object can be accom
plished. Every.consideration of public policy,
the enforcement, of law, the supremacy and
dignity of the Government, demand a treat
ment of this subject far above and beyond auy
mere attempt to collect a public debt.' :i'.'* ' â¢â¢â¢ â¢
The Government occupies a dual relation 1 7 to
the bond-aided railroadsâ as sovereign and as
creditor. In this aspect the question of settle- 1
ment unfolds complications that would not
present themselves in the ordinary relation of
creditor and debtor. A mere creditor might
assent to compromise, which, in a sovereign,
dealing with a dishonest creditor who has vio
lated all laws and covenants, would be repug
nant to puDlic policy. It cannot afford to "con
done fraud, to validate the iniquitous work of
the Credit Mobiher, the Contract and Finance
Company and similar organizations, or to ig
nore the unlawful and outrageous discrimina
tions and extortionate charges and the crimi
nal conspiracies for controlling trade which
have characterized the administration of these
railroads since the date of their completion.
There is only one course open to Congress
and that la the immediate winding up of the
affairs of all the comnanies, enabling the Gov
ernment to withdraw at once from au connec
tion with the running of railroads," or sharing
in the profits of. their management. There
ought be an, end tothe partnership between
the Government and the Pacific railroads: a
speedy and absolute divorce.- ' . â â â -.
â¢ The only method by which this result can
be reached is that which was suggested by
Justice Hunt in the Credit Mobilier cases. It is
the alternative pointed out by the Wilson com
mittee of Congress in the event of the failure
of the equity proceedings in the United States
courts. Tit is the course that Congress directed
the Attorney-General by resolution of April 10,
18(59, to take against the Union Pacific, that is
the forfeiture of the charter.
CHINESE NEW YEAR'S DAY
The One Great Holiday Observed
by the Race Is at
Hand.
It Was Ushered In With an Ear-
Splitting Fusillade of Bombs and.
Firecrackers. '
- Chinese New Year is upon us with all the
ear-splitting < din of tirecrakers and tom
toms anal tne smell' of : sandalwood and
punk. It is the one great holiday of the
Chinese year. For a week every shop will
be closed, all business suspended, and
350,000,000 of "the black-haired race" will
give themselves up to worship, feasting
and jollity unrestrained. Many Ameri
cans are puzzled with the apparent irregu
larity of Chinese New Year's aay. One
year it is .in January ; : the . next year it
may be February. ' ~
; It is really a more scientifically fixed
date than our own New Year. The Chi
nese month follows ' the moon, and there
are ; twelve lunar months. in every year,
with an intercalary month "; occasionally
thrown in like our leap year to make the
time even with the solar year. '.'-.'
Chinese New Year therefore happens at
the time of a new moon and the particular
new moon singled out for this honor is
the first after the sun enters that part of
the zodiac called Aquarius. It can only
occur some time between January 21 and
February 19. â¢" Â«,- .
ÂF or the past few days Chinatown hat
presented a scene â¢of * unusual animation
increasing . as X the ' last 7 day ; approaches',
V esterday. the' streets of Chinatown were
crowded from morning till midnight with
excited Mongolians^ Merchants and clerks
were rushing to and fro, digging up some
wretched debtor andy dunning [him till he
paid his Â£ bill, for all 7 debts 7 must be paid
and old scores wiped * off . by midnight so
that the new year : ; will see a clean ledger.
If he is without means he must find some
kinsman to indorselhis note of hand. The
creditors ;â <' are y, inexorable. J Some ; â¢ settle
ment must be made. iy In China *an unfor
tunate creditor has been known to carry
off a man's door ; and - leave the home ex
posed to the entrance- of {* cvil 7 spirits - and
! all those bad influences which at this time
roam 1 about' and which, above ', all, ho, de
sires to .avoid if he would have a happy
New Year. ... :â¢'â ;â¢. '.-; '-;.,'- ; .
1 7 All day ; yesterday : the retail houses over
flowed with customers. Every Chinese
shopkeeper has a "great clearance sale" on
the last day of the year and great bargains
are to be picked up. Â£ The only, things that
fetch high prices are the new year meats
and drinks which nobody can do without.
Every street in; Chinatown was lined with
stalls, some containing oranges . from San
Wei and big pumeloes from Amoy. There
were: long boxes full of sugarcane from
Hawaii, others were â â  heaped up with can
dies and | melon- seeds and all sorts of
horrid looking indigestible pies and cakes
which only a Chinese could digest. Other
stalls were laden with the Shuey Seen Faâ
the water fairy lily, that sacred" flower sup
posed to bring new year's blessings to the
home where it blooms and distils its fra-
ranee on that morning. There were also
boughs of .peach, and apricot whose blos
soms are as sacred to Chinese new year as
are our holly and mistletoe to Christmas.
X The Swiss scavengers made a pile of
money "cleaning away the heaps of rub
bish accumulations of a whole year thrown
into the street, from every house. Never
during the year is Chinatown so clean as
in its new year, paint and whitewash:
The restaurants are gorgeous, the Hang
Fer Low and the Woey Leen Low on Du
pont street and the Yoot Cheong Low on
Clay street being resplendent in all the
colors of the rainbow. 'â¢--'_ f ,"â¢-..
The . Chinese were busy last evening
hanging up lanterns, decorations and floral
devices with red streamers over their
doors. The shopkeeper pastes a strip of
red paper spangled with gilt, bearing the
prayer, "May the , rich costumer always
come." The family house pastes over the
lintel the prayer, "May the five < blessings
(long life, riches, honors, health and de
scendants) come to me." .
' Paper prayers are also posted on door
posts and walls. ; Good luck inscriptions
also meet the eye at every turn, the object
of which is to attract and gather all the
good spirits and genii that float in the air
at this time around the family hearth.
j All day yesterday last night the de
vout idolater was seen at the temples pay
ing vows and supplicating for mercy.
Early last evening the candles and incense
were lighted, and gilt paper burned to the
household gods and ancestral shrines, for
it-is of the utmost importance that peace
should be made with the spirits of their
ancestors and with the gods who are sup
posed to preside over their domestic affairs.
Last night the little god Tso Kwan, the
kitchen god, was believed to return to his
shrine, and is regaled with the candies he
loves so well. .
It is obligatory on every son of Han to
sit up all night, and last night was no ex
ception, judging from the rumpus in
every house. The Christian Chinese gath
ered together at the Mission rooms -and
spent the evening holding a watch-night
service away from the rites of their old'
worship. â¢ '..
When the hour of midnight struck the
fusillade began. Bundles of firecrackers
were exploded. in every room of China
town. The din as we go to press is terrific.
The meaning of this is a feu de joie to
salute the New Year. It has also the effect
of driving forth all the evil spirits and bad
influences of the year just gone, so that the
young -year may- be uncontaminated by
their > presence. The early hours of the
morning will be spent in offering worship
to heaven and earth, to the ancestral
shrines and to parents and uncles where
present. .
The Consul-General and the Six Com
panies' officials are expected to visit the
council chamber and .bow down to the
tablet of the Emperor, which is equivalent
to homage paid to the dragon throne in
Peking. â â â  7
A CURE FOR LEPROSY
Marvelous -.' Discovery Made y by
a Noted Physician of
Japan.
Patients Inoculated With ; the, Serum j
Xx'X . Claimed to Have Been Made
-; .â > â 'â¢'â¢". Well. *
X VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. .11.â Mail
advices from Japan, which arrived to-day,
say that there is great excitement in
sanitary and medical circles in Japan
over the announcement by the famous
physician, Dr. Ketaslo, that he is able to
produce a serum capable of arresting
leprosy within a few hours after it had
been injected into the sufferer. An in
jection of the same kind will cure cholera
and diphtheria. Further, Dr. Ketaslo
said to a correspondent :
"After years of patient research I am in
a position to state emphatically that I
have at last succeeded in .obtaining a
serum that will , cure leprosy. In . fact, I
have tried it with positive and certain suc
cess. My injection completely neutralizes
the veins of the lepra-bacilli. In due time
sanitariums will be starter ."
, On ; . the scientist being further inter
viewed, he expressed little surprise at the
most astounding statements of recent dis
coveries coming from America. He be
lieved that soon there would be no ail
ments that could not be cured, and science
would advance with such strides that the
world would be peopled with beings supe
rior to the present. For years he had been
convinced that all contagious diseases, ex
cept consumption, could be cured by inoc
ulation. _iiÂ£S&BSBBHB
Because of Dr. Ketaslo. standing and
reputation, his startling announcements
are believed in Japan. Should he prove
his assertion, the Government will en
noble him and load him with decorations.
WILL PENETRATE BORNEO.
Adventurous Americans Embark Upon I
a Perilous Undertaking.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. 11.â
Japan Gazette says two adventurous
Americans, who recently arrived in Yoko
hama,. Dr. W. H. Furness and Dr. H. If.
Miller, who hail from Philadelphia and
are now staying at the Grand Hotel, have
.purchased from Captain Snow the schooner
Retriever, and are now fitting her out with
a view of embarking on an expedition to
Borneo. Their intention is to land on the
western coast of the island, to travel up
one of the rivers as far as the waters will
let them into the interior, and thence to
make their way as best they can to the
eastern side of the island, where, If they
reach there alive; they will be taken home
by the Retriever in waiting. The ambi
tion of the foolhardy- medicos is to pene
trate-further into the interior than any
Englishman or American who has at
tempted it. It is said they followed the
example of the lamented "Prince , Henry,
and heavily insured their lives.

AN EPIDEMIC OF MEASLES.
Strict Measures to Check the Spread of
the Disease at West Point.
WEST POINT, *N. V., Feb. 11.â The
worst epidemic of measles that ever visited
the post has been raging here for several
weeks. The post schools are closed and
everything is being done to keep the dis
ease from spreading. Not only were the
soldiers' quarters in* which measles had
appeared quarantined, but officers also
were in some cases separated from their
families. Married men whose services
could not be spared are quartered in the
post reading-room. If measles had ap
peared in their families their clothing was
thoroughly fumigated.
The hop that was to be held at the open
ing of the new army service barracks haa
been postponed until Easter, week on ac
count of the epidemic. It has not gained
a foothold in the academy, and the author
ites are using every precaution to keep the
disease away.
Judge Davis Is Dying.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Feb. 11.-Judge Alex
ander Davis is dying at the Baptist Sani
tarium in this city. One of the most - en
tertaining chapters of } Mark Twain's
"Roughing It'! is that describing the
lynching at Virginia City, Mont., of Slade,
the Doted outlaw. Judge Davis was one
of the principal actors in tbat memorable
occurrence.
At the time of the lynching of Slade by
the vigilantes Judge Davis was Judge of
the People's Court, a tribunal established
by the people of the camps as the nearest
approach to social order that circum
stances would permit. In the People's
Court trial was granted by Judge, and
i'ury and all the rulings made by Judge
)avis while he sat on that bench were
afterward confirmed by the Federal au
thorities. , y-

Health is life. People who are not healthy

weakness and particularly the weakness

children, comes from some derangement or

street last night. It was one of the most
BALLROOM SCENE AT THE NATIVE SONS' HALL DEDICATION LAST NIGHT.
[Sketched by '" Call " artist.] : V."
typical gatherings of California's sons ever
held in i this City, and the array of ladies
and gentlemen was of such a character that
any State could well afford to be proud of
them.
The magnificent dance hall, which is one
of the largest and best appointed in San
Francisco, was decorated from pillar to
post with orange, green and pink festoons
of bunting, while the stage set off the hall
with well-arranged exotic plants scattered
in profusion from the footlights to the base
of the painting by Thaddeus Walsh of the
City of San Francisco, looking from Goat
Island.
The whole effect was charming, and the
scene on the bay gave depth and color to
the distance and freshened up the whole
picture. The glistening maple floor was im
maculate with its smooth surface and was
in prime condition to receive the dancers,
who filed in from the main hallway at 9:30
with President' James D. Phelan and
Henry Lunstedt leading the grand march.
These gentlemen are too well known to
the native born to need introduction. Im
mediately following came the rest of the
manly young fellows who have had the
pood fortune to see the light here, and on
each good right arm rested a native daugh
ter resplendent with beauty and California
vigor. .
Every native mother's son of 7 them
danced as though the West was the only
.place. from which to come, and in a very j
short time the merriment was at its height.
The remarkable ventilation of the hall j
made it exceedingly comfortable for those
who participated in the pleasure, and after! !
the first number general congratulations
were indulged in and the officers came in
for a goodly share of compliments. Grand
President Dunne and President Phelan,
together with the directors, were com
pelled to. acknowledge that their hopes
were realized, and that the work of erect
ing a grand testimonial to the order was
happily concluded.
Xo more congenial people exist on earth
than our Xative Sons and Xative Daugh
ters, and when they assemble as , they did
last night, the god of mirth and ; content
ment holds supreme sway. ; ...
There were a great many costly and
magnificent dresses to. be: seen and the
boys in their evening dress made an ex
cellent accompaniment to the wealth of
color worn by the ladies.
The programmes were unique Â«_ara pies
of the printers' art, consisting of a ; folder
in the form of the new building," front
view, which when opened, contained a list
of the officers and the various committees,
together.with- the dances, nineteen in all.
The little bear so well known *to . Califor
nians illustrated the various - stages of the
terpsichorean amusement, and 5a v great
many were taken away as souvenirs of the
occasion.

POTTER'S DEATH
STILL A MYSTERY.
Nothing Known of His
Movements After Last
Friday Night.
DETECTIVES AT WORK.
They Are Baffled in Their First
Day's Investigation of the
Case.
WAS LAST SEEN AT THE CLIFF.
Captain Lees Believes He Fell Asleep
on the Beach and Was Caught
by the Tide.
Mystery still surrounds the manner in
which H. Cranston Potter, t the .Tacoma
millionaire, whose body was found on the
ocean beach on Sunday, came to his death.
All idea of suicide, however, 'â  has been
dissipated, and the question now remain
ing to be solved is whether death was due
to an accident or a murderous blow. The
stronger leaning is toward the accident
theory, based on the facts as published in
The Call yesterday. : X-.y:'X-
An investigation of the matter is being,
made by two independent agencies. D.G.
McNaughton. a private detective 7 who
formerly resided in Tacoma,' and who knew
the deceased well, is following up the case
as a friend of the family, and he is some
what imbued with the theory of murder.
, On the other hand, the local detective
force connected with the Police Depart
ment took hold of the matter yesterday on
i the request of Thomas Watson, the San
Francisco .correspondent of the Tacoma
grain firm with which young Potter was
connected. . .'â .. V
7* There were a few new developments yes
terday, but these rather tended to obscure
than 'make clear the situation.
. Dr.' J.-' S. Barrett made an autopsy on
the remains at the undertaking parlors of
H. C. Porter & Co., and came to the con
clusion that death was due to drowning.
The fact that the lungs were found full of
water was considered absolute proof that
Potter was alive when he fell, was washed
or was thrown into the water.
S. Christensen, the 7 barkeeper at the
Cliff House, is the " man who last saw Pot
ter alive, so far as is known. He stated
that Potter, accompanied by a young man,
arrived at the beach between 3 and 4
o'clock Friday, afternoon. They took din
ner together and about 9:45 p. m. appeared
fora final drink at the public bar. They
remained about the bar till after 10 o'clock,
when Potter asked at what time he coula
catch a car for the City. He was told that
the Sutro car left at 10:30, and he and his
companion left to catch that car. Shortly
afterward they returned and .aid they had
missed the car. i
They did not remain 'long, but after
taking another drink started down the
road leading to ; the .beach south of the
Cliff House. "It is from this time that all
definite trace of the deceased is lost. The
next seen of him was about 11 a. m. Sun
day, when a gentleman named Williams
reparted to Captain Morton of the Life-sav
ing Station, situated about half a mile south
of the Cliff .House, that a body was being
tossed about in the surf. It was promptly
recovered and the Coroner notified, : but.it
was not 7 removed .' to the Morgue until
about 5 p.m. - v
-_â¢-: From the description i published '. in the
papers Detective D. J.; McXaughton was
induced to visit the Morgue, and , was the
man who identified the remains as those
of the Tacoma capitalist.
â â >-â  Since that i time McXaughton i has been
investigating 7 the matter, and inclines
strongly to '; the opinion that Potter met
with foul play. , This is based largely on
the condition of the body when recovered
from the water. It showed few bruises or
abrasions and only such as would be made
by.its being roiled back and I forth by the
surf.-with the?' exception of 1 a cut on the
head just back of and to the right of the
center of the skull. â¢, : . y;. ; ...
This McXaughton says was a fracture of
the skull about one and a half inches long
and about one-eighth of an inch wide at
the most open portion of the wound. 7 He
argues from this- that Potter was struck
,wit ' some \ heavy instrument, such as a
club or cane, and knocked or .thrown into'
the water from the -beach. He says that
there 7 is' no I place in tbe vicinity ' from
which ' Pottet could : have fallen into * the
water without 7 receiving 7 more cuts than
this one. Another suspicious circumstance
in McXaughton's mind 'Â» is the failure, of
the man who was with Potter at the 7 Cliff
House to make himself known to the au
thorities or the friends of the deceased. .
As soon as the attention of Captain Lees
was j called to the matter by Thomas Wat
son,'he detailed Detectives Ed ward Gibson
and: Edward, Wren, on the case.*! The result
of the joint investigation of the two offi
cers appears Jin the following report made
last night to Captain Lees: X.:X>XX'Â
>7 ; '.-,; '--U'/'X San Francisco, Feb. 11, 1896. :
X Captain I. W. Leesâ Dear Sir: v Acting â -, upon
your instruction Officer Ed Wren and myself
went to the Cliff House this afternoon with
Thomas Watson and saw 8. Christensen, a bar
keeper, and tie says â¢ that ' Mr. rotter and Dr."
Hicks came out to -7 the Cliff House one
day last week, and had a drink and then left. v
; He saw Mr. Potter again on last Friday after
noon, as he came into the barroom with a
stranger. They had a. drink. and then went
into the â  dining-room and had supper, and
after supper they drank a quart bottle of cham
pagne. After supper they came into the bar
room again and took another drink, Pot
ter put down a dollar and, the barkeeper placed
aSO-cent piece in change on the counter. The
stranger picked up the change and said to Mr.
Potter, "Here is your change." They seemed
to be very friendly, as though they had known
each other for a long time. _../,
The waiter who served p them said that Potter
kicked over the table after he got through
drinking his wine and acted anything but a
gentleman. * Mr. Pearson,* one of the proprie
tors, said he noticed Potter and the stranger at
the bar, and that Potter was drunk, but he
could walk all right. Every cent that the two
men spent was spent by Potter, the other man
paying lor nothing. v.-.
-When the barkeeper of the Cliff j House said
to Mr. Potter, "Here is your change," Potter
took it, walked to the door and , then came
back and said to him, "That fellow is no good:
don't you trust him." Potter asked what time
he could get a car to town, and I told him
10:30. : 7, â  : â :,â¢:â¢â¢
When he came to the Cliff first it was between
3 and 4 o'clock; and he left about 10:30 p. M.
While he was at the bar the first time he asked'
me if I would lend him $5, and I said, "Yes,
if you want it," but he did not ask for it.
While Potter and the stranger were at the bar
they acted as friends. Potter took the stranger's
watch once and put it on the bar and said : "Is
this good for a drink?" and then gave it back
to his friend. -i -,
â¢' The following is a description of the man
with Potter : About 5 feet Bor 9 ; age about 33
slender build, light complexion, light hair and
small mustache; black suit, with nice-fitting
cutaway coat, clean white j shirt, collar and
cuffs, gold link cuff-buttons, dark red tie witn
gold pin, black derby hat. - He carried a pair of
new tan gloves and acted and looked like a
gentleman.
â â _â : After leaving the Cliff House we went to the
other road house, but could find no one who
had seen any one answering their description,
either on Friday or on Saturday. Respectfully,
Edward Gibson,
M. Ween.
Detective Officers.
They will continue the investigation to
day. In a conversation with Detective
Gibson he said they were unable to get
any trace whatever of either Potter or his
Cliff House companion after they left that
hostelry. He bad heard that a Mr. Hood
had seen Potter talking to some one on
Market street at about noon on Saturday,
but it had been impossible to find. Hood.
It 1 is- the belief of Detective Gibson that
Potter never returned to town after he left
the Cliff House.
"Potter," he said, "evidently started to
catch the steam car which leaves the beach
south of the Cliff House after he had
missed the Sutro car. He was not too
drunk to walk, but was getting sufficiently,
muddled to have missed his way and in
some way to have fallen into the water. "7;
While Gibson is strongly of the opinion
that Potter came to his death accidentally
he concedes there is a probability of foul
play having taken place.
Captain Lees is more outspoken. He
says he believes that Potter was so stupid
from drink that he lay down on the beach
near the water and went to sleep; that the
incoming tide caught him and that before
he could extricate himself in his drunken
condition he was drowned.
According to the statements made at the
undertakers and at the Coroner's office
Detective McXaughton is mistaken as to
the character of the wound on the head of
the deceased. At both places the wound
is described as being merely one of. the
scalp and which left the skull absolutely
intact. '.â â '
The remains were shipped to Tacoma
last night by express and without being
accompanied by any one. Relatives .will
take charge of them at Portland, however.
At least 100 people viewed them at the un
dertaker's, mostly friends.
The inquest will take place to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock. . y *,
A strong circumstance tending to prove
the theory of accidental, drowning is that
there had been no attempt to despoil the
unfortunate man, as his watch and chain
and other valuable jewelry and trinkets
were found upon him by the Coroner.
;It was stated on Monday by the cham
bermaid of the Occidental Hotel that Pot
ter had slept in his room at the hotel Fri
day â  night. ; She modified this statement
yesterday by saying that the bed had the
appearance Saturday- morning of having
been lain i, upon, probably some time dur
ing Friday, but evidently no one had slept
in it, as the blankets were not turned back.
It was learned yesterday that Potter car-*
ried a $5000 accident policy, and that the
local agent of the company in which he is
insured made an inspection of the remains
yesterday and left satisfied that death had
resulted , from an accidental cause, viz.:
from drowning, and he will so report to
his company. - ' -
FOUL PLAY SUSPECTED..

credit the Reports of His Hav
ing Committed Suicide.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 11.â credence \
is placed here in the report that Potter j
committed suicide. , He had no worry, was
of a jovial disposition, ; had no large debts,
and at the time ne left here he had in the
neighborhood of $200 on him. 'XXX'^XXX,
| He was no more unfortunate in his busi
ness ventures than others with the same
amount of money, and the report that he
has squandered a fortune is unfounded.
- : He was an expert j swimmer and thor
oughly at home in the water. He was very
punctual in making returns of investments
to his father and was only allowed the
profits. y-- 7 ,:
His life with his family has been a most
happy one, and he had no business difficul

; i The menu was excellent and the wines
merited 7. special y praise , from his y Ãoyal
Highness,' who remarked that he noticed
in them a body and bouquet which â¢ re
minded him forcibly of the; famous vin
tages of his native land, y At , ; intervals
during the meal choice selections by clas
sical composers were rendered by the Palace
Hotel orchestra, under the able and exper
ienced direction of Harry T. Hock. 7 The
rendering of Czibalka's gavotte "La Prin-;
cesse'' was encored, as was ; also Lysberg's
exquisite fantasia. "The Luteplayer."
The musicians, however, made one faux
pas. â In one of the portfolios a; copy of
Garibaldi's battle ; hymn i was found. To
Harry's mind it seemed singularly appro
priate to the occasion i and the ; orchestra
forthwith proceeded to render it with all
the spirit and fire which -the martial air
requires in order to sound as it should. On
hearing tne familiar strain' a half-amused,
half-horrified glance passed round the
board, and [ one of the guests, speeding
.toward : the ! bower where â <>-, the ; musicians
'were placed, caused them to desist. 7 7
* After dessert Mr. Calegaris, who acted as
toastmaster,' made a ' brief address '; of wel
come to the royal guest of the' evening, to
the Governor and to all present. He dwelt
at some length upon the peace and pros
perity which have attended the fortune of
Italy s sons in the United States, and par
ticularly :in '. California, and expressed a
hope that his countrymen and the Ameri
can people might live as brothers, bound
together by ties of mutual interest and re
gard. He also referred to the duties . in
cumbent upon all who reside on American
soil, and ended by raising his glass to the
health of the President of the United
States. The toast was honored amid much
applause.
The Italian Consul, Chevalier Bruno
Grimaldi,,then proposed the health of the
Italian royal 7. family." The Prince re
sponded to the 'â ' toast. As he rose ]he
seemed 7 almost like a boy, but â¢ when he
spoke it was evident that beneath a youth
ful exterior he keeps stowed away a fund
of graceful | and persuasive eloquence. It
gave him pleasure, he said, to accept the
hospitality of his countrymen at so great
a distance from their native land, and he
could not resist a certain feeling of pride
as he observed the standing of his com
patriots in the Golden State. . He proposed
a toast to the State of California and its
chief executive officer. -
Governor Budd, who before the dinner
had vowed he wouldn't say a word, find
ing himself thus called upon, responded
in a singularly ; graceful , speech, which
smacked just a little of, preparation. He
assured the Prince that the welcome which
California had extended "him was warm
and real. America, he said, owed much to
Italy. In .a certain sense she owed her
very existence as a civilized quarter of the
globe to Italy, since an Italian was the
first to open her portals to- the ingress of
civilization..; ,
"Captain Bertolini responded to the toast,
"The Italian Colony,'' in a brief but elo
quent expression of the appreciation with l
which he and his colleagues would ever
hold in grateful remembrance the cordial
hospitality, which they had experienced at
the. hands of their compatriots in San
Francisco. >
General Forsyth rose to the toast, "The
American Army." The white-haired vet
eran " showed 7 himself as much at home
amid after-dinner ; joys fas on the battle
field, and his eloquent and patriotic reply
was frequently interrupted by bursts of
cheering. ' ' y ' " â *â â¢ ;â - -- â â¢; â - "777'-
The ' last toast of \ the evening was
"The Friendship - between- the - United
States and Italy. A. Sbarboro responded
in an address so replete with patriotic elo
quence as to call forth many expressions
of approval. He said the Italian citizen
loved Italy as his mother, while cherish
ing his new country; as the wife of his
bosom. He hoped the time might never
come when the United States would Â« have
to go to war with ' any other nation but
should that dread event come to pass
Italian blood would be poured 7 forth gen
erously in defense of the land . which had
been discovered by an Italian and in which
an Italian was free to enjoy all the rights
and privileges of ; American citizenship.
He hoped peace; and friendship might
never cease to bind the two great nations
to each other for all time.
After a half-hour of â  informal conversa
tion, the Prince arose and thanking his
hosts for their genial hospitality left the
dining hall amid a volley of cheers.

ABSAHAM LINCOLN.
The birthday of Abraham Lincoln has
its anniversary to-day and the event should
not pass unnoted or unheeded by any por
tion of the American 'â  people. ; The anni
versary has not been: set apart as a Na
tional holiday,' and perhaps .it is just ''as'
well that it has' not. X Such holidays are
; apt, like that of Washington, to become
merely perfunctory â¢ observances 7on the
part of officials and to be neglected by the
people. It is better that the birthday of
Lincoln should be left for commemoratiou
to the loyalty of the popular heart without
other prompting than that J which comes
from the press devoted to the mainte
nance undiminished of all the best influ
ences of American life. .7
At this particular juncture in our poli
tics it is more important to revive the in
fluence of Lincoln than that of Washing
ton himself. The illustrious man whose
happy fortune it was to establish the in
dependence of the colonies, found the Na
tion and earn the proud title of the "Father
of the Republic" * stands as a { representa
tive of American liberty airainst European
aggression, of republicanism against any
form of monarchy and the broadest Na
tional patriotism against any lesser or sec
tional ' patriotism : whatever. ' At the pres
ent time, however, . none of these things
are "assailed or doubted. All of them are
secure. Independence, Republicanism and
the Union are established beyond contro
versy and from the ' influence of Washing
ton therefore there comes at this time no
inspiration affecting anything that can be
called a vital problem of the day.
The influence of Lincoln is felt in mat
ters which still . constitute perplexing
problems of our National life. True it is
that the Union is perpetuated and slavery
destroyed beyond all possibility of change,
but Lincoln stood for much more than
Union and emancipation and he repre
sents much more in the popular concep
tion of him. He is the supreme example
in our history, and in all history, of that
principle expressed by him in the im
mortal address at Gettysburg: . "A gov
ernment of the people, by the people, for
the people." He represents the fuilest re
liance upon the common-sense of the peo
ple for the establishment of the best gov
ernment and it is for that reason bis influ
ence and his memory are of such value to
us now. **"'_ . 7 f;y â¢
There are abundant evidences that not a
few citizens have begun to despair of pop
ular government. In books, in lectures,
in magazines and not infrequently, in
newspapers, we are confronted by com
plaints of those who attribute every < evil
of municipal misgo*. eminent, State cor
ruption and Congressional wrong-doing to
that universal suffrage which elects the
authorities of cities and States and the
Nation. Amid the waitings of these
pessimists, . mugwumps, or non-partisans,
it is well for us to recall the memory of
him who was the truest representative of
the American ' people of ' his time, and
whose character stands as the type of
American manhood to this day. 7 Under
the spell of his influence none can doubt
the wisdom of the people nor deny their
willingness to follow right leaders when
great emergencies arise and when to
choose wrongly would result in disaster to
the Republic.
A thousand difficult problems confront
us. The strife incessantly breaking out
between labor and capital,' the grasping
greed of great corporatious, the violence of
strikes carried to excess, the outbreaks of
lynch law, the folly and not infrequently
the apparent corruption of legislators and
even of courts, where justice should be in
violate all these offenses, ' complicated
with one another and intricately involved,
constitute a thousand-fold problem suffi
cient to perplex the wisest statesman, and
! yet in our form of government it is upon
the common-sense of common men we
must rely for the solution of them all.
Surely, then, it must be a satisfaction to
every patriot to' remember that he who
was in our greatest emergency the wisest
of our leaders never faltered in his faith
in the people any more than the people
faltered in their faith in him, and for the
sake of that satisfaction it is worth .while
to recall with honor this morning the
memory and influence of Abraham Lin
coln. 'â  7 .
TSAIN-WEECKING STOPPED.
It would be impossible ' to find a more
common-sense decision than the one ren
dered by the Supreme . Court in the case
of one Thompson, convicted and sentenced
to death in the lower court for wrecking
and robbing a train. , It is true that in
sustaining the rulings and verdict and
thus insuring the infliction of a richly
deserved death penalty the Supreme Court
severely censured the looseness with which
the act prohibitirf- the offense was drawn,
but it is most gratifying to observe that
the court sought and easily found the
evident intent of the act in spite of its
verbal blunders, and pursued the same
course with reference to the complaint. ââ¢
The court did wisely in. calling the at
tention of the Code Commissioners to the
inadequacy of the act. In view of the sus
tention of the law by the Supreme Court
this might be deemed unnecessary, but
there is always. danger that opportunities
may arise for the intervention of the .fed
eral courts, and hence the needed revision
should be given. While the Code Com
missioners are redrafting - the act they
might well take into account the fact that
the provision prohibiting the burning or
setting on fire of a railroad trestle for the
purpose of wrecking a train does not in
clude other and - even simpler and more
dangerous ways of destroying the strength
of a trestle. An engine-driver might hap
pen to discover the fact that a trestle'^ had
been burned, but lit would be impossible
for him to see that its timbers had been
either partly withdrawn or so nearly sawn
through that the structure could ; not sup
port the weight of a train. '. â¢'. ' 7
A CUEIOUS SITUATION.
While both the United States and Mex
ican. authorities are loudly 7 announcing
that 7 the Fitzsiramons-Malier prize-fight
will not. be permitted in either country,
Dan This, Bill That and Jim The Other,
"managers" and "promoters" of the
"event," are as loudly asserting : that " the
"mill" will assuredly be "pulled off," and
are not only urgently insisting that lovers
of the "manly sport" from all parts of the
country should 7 come and r witness the
affair, but are, offering heavy odds in bets
that it will take place. ' Meanwhile - the
Governor of Texas has ordered the for
midable "Rangers'! to sleep on their arms
and 'be ready for instant - fighting in the
field, and the militia of New Mexico and
the mounted.: border ; guard of Mexico are
under arms and scouring the banks of the
Rio Grande with cocked rifles and a thirst
for battle. â¢" ' â  "â  .

not seem -possible even :to the newspaper
correspondents who are on the ground. : â¢

more than they give out, likely being
pledged to. silence for the present, seem to
believe that the fight will really take place.

this could happen : but that would reflect
either, on the, efficiency or the honesty of

That Mexico, the ancient promoter of bull
fights, should " have become suddenly ; so
bitterly antagonistic to prize-fights is one
of the mysteries of the century. If the
fight does take place the fact will be a-: re

FERTILIZING THE PAH.
. Superintendent McLaren of Golden Gate
Park has made a . straightforward state
ment to â  the Merchants'. Association con
cerning the transportation of street-sweep
ings to the park. A,s the Southern Pacific
has refused to carry them any longer, and
as they are , very useful at the park, he
urges that the association interest itself in
the y matter. He asserts that the - Park
Commissioners cannot pay more than 25
cents a cubic yard, and that the contract
street-sweepers are ready to allow 50 cents,
the cost to them for getting the sweepings
out of the way. According to Mr. Mc-
Laren's figures it will cost $1 a cubic yard
to deliver the sweepings by team ; hence
25 cents more is needed. He suggests that
the ; association , appropriate 10 cents a
yard toward the expense, and that 'an
effort be made to get the work done for 85
cents.
Mr. McLaren further says that with the
construction of the proposed electric line
to parallel the park arrangements ; can
probably be made for transporting the
sweepings by that means at a small cost.
He probably means to say that the places
in the park where the sweepings are
needed are so far from the termini of the
present cable lines that nothing could be
saved by fan arrangement with them. A
question concerning the ability of a cable
road to carry such freight might also be
raised. X â  : XX/.yy-
The problem is evidently a difficult one.
It is no more incumbent on the Merchants'
Association to assist with the expense than
on any other organized body or any pri
vate citizen. In perfect fairness all such
improvements should be made by general
taxation. If the Merchants' Association
does come to the rescue it will be perform
ing a public service of conspicuous value. I
It has done such things in the past, bear
ing an expense which the whole people
should have shared. For this it deserves
the generous praise which it constantly
receives. But no worthy citizen should be
willing to see its public spirit and good
nature imposed on.
Why would it not be possible for the
Park Commissioners with the sanction of
the Board of Supervisors to arrange for
some public entertainment of a spectacu
lar character at the park by means of
which funds can be raised for this and
perhaps other needed improvements? If
the park could be used for a Midwinter
Fair it certainly could for some other
kind of exhibition. The best time for do
ing this might be upon the completion of
the new music concert place' but as there
is need of hurry the Commissioners need
not wait for that. ", A series of fine and
wholesome, sports in the present bicycle
circle with a moderate entrance fee would
doubtless : yield a considerable revenue.
This is merely a general suggestion, but it
seems to offer a solution of the present
difficulty. â y : â --.'-. '.'.â¢- . '.-'.. 7
SAN JOSE'S NEW BO AD.
The Board of Supervisors of Santa Clara
County has granted a franchise for ah
electric road from San Jose to Saratoga
ana Congress Springs, in the foothills of
the Santa Cruz Mountains on the eastern
verge of the Santa Clara Valley. The road
is 'to carry both passengers and freight,
the latter nt, night only, and freightcars
are not to be hauled through the city. It
is not yet announced where the power
house is to-be placed nor what kind of
fuel is to be used. It would be possible to
secure' water power in the mountains for
the purpose. These are details which are
now to be worked out.
If the new road, as likely it will, adopts
a standard gauge it could easily run its
cars upon the track of the steam road pro
jected to connect San Jose with the deep
water of San Francisco : Bay :at Alviso.
Thus a stretch . of country about sixteen
miles in length and including San Jose,
Santa Clara* and . a very rich and densely
settled "ore hard and vineyard section/will
pass entirely from under the monopoly of
the Southern Pacific so far as local traffic
is concerned. y This should be made to add
enormously to the prosperity and wealth
of those parts 7of Santa Clara County 'i
which will enjoy that advantage. '
The new road to Saratoga will at once
induce the planting of a large area in
vines, oranges and deciduous fruits. Sara
toga is a hamlet nestling; in the foothills
and overlooking the broad expanse of one
of the most enchanting valleys in the
world. A fine wagon road, following the
hills from - Los Gatos 'to Mountain View,
passes ? through the village, and Â«it'| will
serve as a -valuable feeder to the electric
road. As the hew road will run out Sara
toga avenue, a broad : highway connecting
San I Jose and Saratoga, and as the great
advantage of an electric road is that its
cars stop everywhere, every farm will
become a station and every acre of ground
will come under cultivation. .
; Tbe exigencies of the . Southern Pacific
Company's ' business demand ' that it, too,
shall contribute to the welfare of the valley.
Besides having an early prospect of com
petition for the traffic of that section it is
steadily pushing X its'-, coast ? line toward
Santa Barbara, and as this when com
pleted will te made a part of the southern
overland . line for ; passenger '[ business, all
the traffic ; will pass through the Santa
Clara Valley and ; have an opportunity to
see the wonderful development 'to which
its fruit-growing industry has been carried.
The programme for home legislation
outlined in the Queen _ ; speech includes
such measures as making employers
liable for accidents to employes, the crea
tion of a board for f the relief of agricul
tural ; distress^ the" regulation of pauper
immigration ; and the '-, construction by . the
Government of 'electric railways through*

AMERICANS FOR THE NAVY.
The bill introduced .by Mr. Low in the House
of Representatives providing for the establish
ment of recruiting depots for the navy along
the New England coast and on \ the Hudson
and the Great Lakes is directly in line with the
recommendations made to Secretary Tracy by
Admiral Erben in 1889. In a letter to the Sec
retary of the Navy he then said that, with the
exception of | those enlisted under honorable
discharge and continuous-service certificates,
our man-of-war's men- should be taken from
among , our landsmen or watermen serving
along the coast. * He.^l not believe that the
best men were reach* by the receiving sta
tions at Boston, New York, Philadelphia and
San Francisco, but that the finest recruiting
field" was along the coast from the capes of the
Delaware to Eastport, Long Island Sound and
the Delaware and Hudson rivers. He pro
posed judicious advertising in these regions,
the sending of small vessels at proper seasons
of the year along the coast and up the rivers to
gather in those willing to enlist, the keeping
of them apart from other- men-of-war's men
and the selection, so far as possible, of petty
officers from among their own number and the
holding together of men from one locality. . -
: All the * important features of Admiral Er
ben's plan have been adopted by the framer of
the present bill and some other valuable pro
visions have been- added. Besides the ad
miral's proposed depots at â  Portsmouth and
Newport recruits are to be gathered at Bangor
and Eastport, Me.; Newburg, N. V.; Erie, Pa.,
and Cleveland, Ohio. This system of enlist
ment,.gathering up on training-ships and dis
position for service in bodies is to apply only
to Americans. This will be a special â¢ induce
ment for this , class of men to join the navy,
and the Government can afford to grant some
special privileges to lessen the proportion of
foreigners on our men-of-war. Many young
men along the coast' work harder on fishing
and trading boats part of the year and save up
no more than they would in the navy. But
the Government service has not been attrac
tive because it separated men from friends and
threw them among. the foreign sailors who are
nicked up in the great cities. With reasonable
concessions to their superior intelligence and
feelings a large body of i American , sailors
might be gathered, similar . to * that which
existed when we had a great merchant marine
and were able to pick the best of our native
born. sailors for I our warships. ,We have no
such - body of merchant sailors now, but we
still have sturdy young landsmen and fisher
men, who, with proper incentives, can be
drawn into their country's service.â New York

VICTORY FOR THE ROAD

j
STATE LAW UNCONSTITUTIONAL
Supreme Court Issues a Writ Com
pelling Fresno Trustees to Grant
a Franchise.
The San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railway Company won a victory
yesterday which gives.- a precedent lor
steam railways securing rights of way,
through city streets without having to
observe the statutory rule of advertising
and bidding for the privilege. The suit
grew out of a difference of opinion between
the Trustees of Fresno and the Valley road
regarding a - franchise along Q street in
Fresno.
The Fresno Trustees elected to give a
franchise to the Valley Railway in ac
cordance with the statute of 1893, which
required that the franchise be advertised
for in the public press and sold to the
highest bidder. The railway directors,
acting on the advice of E. F. Preston,
counsel for the board, declined to accept
the franchise under those conditions for
various reasons. ; It' was held by Mr. Pres
ton that the act of 1893 was not constitu
tional in regard to steam railways, and
that, therefore, the proposition of the
Fresno Trustees was not legal. Again it
was contended that a franchise accepted
under the statute of 1893 would not have
a clear title, and this fact would prove a
serious obstacle in the event of bonding
the railway at any* future time.
The Valley road's attorney consequently
filed a petition in the Supreme Court for a
writ of mandamus to compel the Fresno
Trustees to grant the franchise in conform
ity with his contention.
The first petition, submitted with the
belief that oral argument before the court
would be allowed, was not successful, as
the writ asked for was denied January 10
by the court. This order, however, was
made with the understanding that an
amended petition be filed.
In the second document the -petitioner
stated that mandamus was the proper
remedy, holding that a steam railway was
a public use, and the power of the Hoard
of Trustees of Fresno City with respect to
the granting or denying the application
was a quasi-judicial function.
Several authorities are quoted. The
Board of Trustees was empowered to act
for public purposes, viz.: to control or
direct a public use. He said : " 7â¢ ' 'â¢'"
A steam railroad asks permission to use cer
tain public streets. The board advertises for
bids, and John Doe, who has never made any
application, is the. highest bidder and the
board. grants him a franchise. Where in the
law outside of this statute of 1893 is there any
authority given for such a procedure ? Where
does the application of this railroad receive
â  any consideration whatever?: What becomes
of the rights flowing to the company by virtue
of its franchise obtained. by its organization
under and its compliance "with the general
laws of the State relating to railroad corpora
tions?
Again, what other remedy has this petitioner
but mandamus? How can it obtain that dis
cretionary action if the board refuses to con
sider at all? It may be said that the applica
tion can be denied, but is it a presumption to
be tolerated that the consideration will be
other than one that is just and fair to the ap
plicant and to tne public, with due regard. to
the rights of both? Petitioner only desires to
obtain such a consideration. '
Upon the question of remedy we very respect
j fully submit that unless the statute of 1893 is
! valid and operative the Board of Trustees
of the city of Fresno should be compelled to
pass upon the application of petitioner.
In the second part of the petition it was
shown that under settled rules of statutory
interpretation the statute of 1893 did not
apply to steam railroads, and cases and au
thorities were cited to support the conten
tion. Regarding the act of 1893 it was
held that that statute was unconstitu
tional, since it provided for "the sale of
railroad and other franchises in munici
palities, and relative! to the granting of
franchises," while the constitution of Cali
fornia stated that "every act shall em
brace but one subject, which subject shall
be embraced in its title."
The Supreme Court decided in favor of
the petitioner as follows:
The foregoing order is set aside and ordered
that an alternative writ of mandate issue as
prayed, returnable . before the Supreme Court
in bank at San Francisco, on Monday, the 2d of
March, 1896, at 10 a. m. Beatty, C. J.,
Temple, J.

â¢ That portion of the metropolis known as
the Potrero and South San Francisco was
until quite recently as remote from ; the
real city of San Francisco as though it was
an adjacent ; and ; separate township gov
erned by a corporate body of its own. This
condition of affairs has, however, changed
since the old time. "Long Bridge" has
disappeared and in its stead extends a
continuous well-paved street running from
the southern end of Fourth street to the
far end of South San Francisco, and upon
which line of electric cars run 1 regularly
from North Beach to the end of Kentucky
street and Sixteenth avenue. This with a
cross-line on Sixteenth street tapping the
Western Addition to Kentucky street at
the Union Iron Works has brought the
heretofore isolated section into direct
travel line with all the principal sections
of the City proper.
Asa consequence of this facility of direct
and speedy means of- travel the southern
section has started in to improve its con
dition by commencing to 7 build handsome
residences* and . stores on^the; principal
streets.
' The old rookery on Kentucky and Yuba
streets known as the "King's Castle.: is
being torn down for firewood, and the
owner of the -; premises,- Dr. Wilkins, .is
about to erect a substantial three-story
nrick building in its stead. Other less pre
tentious buildings will also, soon be built
on that portions of Kentucky street adja
cent' to the rolling-mills and Spreckels'
sugar-mills. Such buildings have become
a necessity in consequence of the number
of workmen employed in that portion of
the city. The â¢ JJnion â¢ Iron Works â¢ alone
has over 1700 men on its payroll. ,7 Spreck
els' Sugar Works employs about' 6oo men
the year round. 1 ' These, with the rolling
mills, where there are between 200 and 300,
and . the rope works i? and pother,* smaller
places, including Butcbertown, contain

THE PROTESTANT ORPHANS
Reports of the Work for a Year
: of the Orphanage on Haight
Street.
Decrease in the Number of Inmates
â¢ and the Explanation
Given.
The forty-fifth annual meeting of the
Protestant Orphan Asylum was held yes
terday at St. John's Presbyterian Church.
Reports were read to show that there were
20. children in the asylum at the begin
ning of the year February, 1, 1895. Since
that time forty have been admitted, fifty
nine have been removed by friends, eleven
have been indentured to homes, two have
been sent to the home for feeble-minded
children and two have been adopted.
. One report read at the meeting sets forth
that the decrease in the number of chil
dren cared for is not from any lack on the
part of the management to receive and
care for the homeless little ones, but that
the explanation may be found in the re
cent establishment of other Protestant or
phanages which draw from the class which
but a few years ago could find shelter only
within the walls of the Protestant Orphan
Asylum or those of the Home of the La
dies' Protective and Relief Society.
The year was a prosperous one, and
there were but two changes in the corps of
employes and two in the corps of teachers.
Mrs. E. AX McNear, the matron, is still in
charge, and Mrs. yon Tillow still holds the
Erincipalship of the. school. Extensive
ut necessary repairs were made to replace
what decay had weakened.
During the year R. E. Raimond, one of
the trustees,- passed' away, and W." B.
Hooper was chosen to fill the vacancy, and
C. R. Bishop was chosen to rill the vacancy
caused by the continued absence from the
State of .William Babcock.
The report concludes with expressions
of gratitude for legacies and contributions
received during the year.
Not a death nas occurred at the asylum
for five years. 9 There are now 170 children
in the asylum.7 This is a smaller number
than 7 the society lias had to care for in
many years. It is felt that the decrease in
applications for assistance is an encourag
ing sign. X

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Coal Vessels That Cannot Get
Rid of Their Cargo Owing
; to the Glut.
SOME HELD THIRTY -FIVE DAYS.
A Protest From Passengers on the
Sausalito Ferry About Blowing
the Whistle. â¢
.The enormous quantities ,of coal that
have arrived lately from Newcastle, Eng.,
Swansea, and Newcastle, Australia, have
almost glutted the market and in conse
quence the merchants have found consid
erable difficulty in handling the- ship
ments. Vessels have .been compelled to
stay out their full lay days and the masters
are protesting in consequence. The Re
liance was thirty-three days at anchor be
fore an ounce of her cargo was taken out,
and the Monkbarns of the same line will
not dock before next Thursday and j she
will then have been thirty-rive days await
ing a chance to discharge. Even with his
cargo out Captain Atkinson's position will
not be very much improved as charters are
going begging at .0 shillings, and as his
owners refused 32 shillings when the ves
sel was .loading in Swansea, the chances
are that the Monkbarns wiil be laid up at
Sausalito. 1 7 â :- -.'*_ ,;-...;.
After being shifted from post to pillar
the Reliance was finally docked at the
Rosenfeldbunkers yesterday to discharge
the last of her cargo. In spite of the fact
that she has discharged over. 3000 tons of
coal she looked more like a yacht than a
coal ship. -Captain Robinson takes great
care of his vessel and .in â . consequence
everything was shipshape and as clean as
a new Din. As she was towed up to the
wharf a great crowd gathered and when
the docking was successfully accomplished
there was a rush to get aboard and inspect
the ship. "/..-.' y.X-_
The Reliance is one of the best built and
finest vessels in port. , Captain Robinson
has been in ber seven years and he knows
whereof he speaks when he says "a faster
vessel is not afloat." . She is certainly an
ideal vessel in which to travel. Her cabins
are large and commodious and the crew's
quarters are perfect. y " y y yy*7' ; .
The only objection the men have to the
vessel is the height of her masts. The
main is 180 feet from, deck to truck, and
one old salt voiced the : sentiments of ' the
other men yesterday when he said: "If
the old man would only have the sky
sail pole taken off, we would ' travel '< all
around the earth with him. As it is, there
is too much climbing, and we sailors don't
want to get to heaven before our time." -
Belonging to the same line as the Re
liance is the Pegasus, which sailed a few
days ago; the Sir Robert Fernie, now on
her way from Newcastle, Australia; the
Glencaird and Kearny Hill, which .will be
here next spring, and the Monkbarns," now
in port. The Reliance brought the ; mail
from Pitcairn, and Captain Robinson has
now a number of souvenirs of the landers
on board. Among them is a piece of wood
which is painted "For Auld Lang Syne";
another has on it "I Love Thee,", and two
polished cocoanuts have on them "Wel
come Home.", All have painted in the
corner "Pitcairn." Â. , .
The Reliance will load wheat at 7 Port
Costa, and from here will go to Cork for
orders. â¢â¢' y ; . ;7 ,-â  "yy .'.-.. y'7-
The following protest 'about the whist
ling of the Sausalito 'â¢ ferry-boats before
sailing time comes from a tourist: â 
Editor Callâ morning the whistle for
the 10:05 boat was sounded fully. ten minutes
before the hour at which the boat is timed to
leaveâ live minutes being j the . usual s time.
Passengers began ; crowding the waiting-room
expecting every minute to go aboard, but the
boat did not leave the wharf until 10:30 or ex
actly forty minute.' after the blowing t of ; the
whistle. 7 ,:':.â¢ â â ,'.'.-.: : .//-:.:. :
This is not an t isolated', case, as . passengers
by this boat are often greatly inconvenienced
by the irregularity and delay in leaving. land
other patrons of the road J think that there is
no need of blowing the whistle three-quarters
of an hour before it is possible for the boat to
leave, the usual five minutes being more con
venient. . â -..-. â¢>. â¢ .â¢â >â¢â¢â¢
If it is found impossible to start this boat on
her schedule time why not change the time?
The crew of the 'American ship Wachu
sett are having a hard . time .of ; it to keep
the ship clear j. of 7 water. ' She was j badly
strained on the 7 run down \ from Puget
Sound and the men were constantly at the
pumps. Since her arrival there has been
no chance to dock her and every day: the
different watches have to take their r trick
at the pumps in order to keep her afloat.
-As soon as her cargo- is discharged ; she
will be docked for repairs.
PEDDLEES MUST MOVE.
Fruit and Poultry > Dealers': Association
:'" Will Petition for "Relief.7 7
; The Fruit and Poultry, Dealers' Associa
tion devoted' the greater part of the', time
of their meeting "last night to organizing.
The most important work of the evening,
however, was the drafting of a petition to
be presented to Chief {ot X Police j Crowley
-asking that peddlers of fruit be prohibited
from standing in one place; on the street
while selling their wares, be compelled
to move ; about 'the City. This : petition,
will be presented to the Chief of the
Police in* a few days. yy. , y '.-..â¢ ixX\". /-y
,7; The dealers advance as a reason for this
request that peddlers will come to a stand
in a location very near to a fruit store' and
thus y injure y that . dealer's 7; trade. They
further,: claim 7 that these itinerant 5 fruit
dealers [pay- a very ; much smaller license
than regular ' dealers and in'- some in-*
stances sell with no license whatever.
Thus there is an unjust discrimination.:.* ;>
.The association recognizes that there are
certain laws which fully 7 cover ; this point
and therefore they will have their petition
carefully prepared before presenting it.
FRED EMERSON BROOKS.
The Poet Arrives -Here. Hale and Pros
perous, After an Absence of
"-. Six Tears.
Fred Emerson Brooks, the California
poet and author, who has been absent in
New _ ork for the past six â¢ years, is at the
Palace. He is accompanied by J. Williams
Macy, the humorist and buffo-basso.
They have : been giving entertainments
over the country, > something after the
order of Nye and Riley., ..V â 
In one way or another, sometimes as a
lecturer and " again as a poet and play
wright, Mr. Brooks has been before the pub
lic nearly all the time during his absence.
i He says he has done, very well, having
made money, and he , now owns a fine
place in New York. y
â â :â â â¢ He says that when he went away from
here many of his friends counseled him
against it. | They said the East was full of
everything he could furnish. Under all
the circumstances he is gratified at the
kindly reception shown him and with the
success he has had.
* The gentlemen are traveling under the
! auspices of Major Pond. They will appear
to-night in Santa Rosa, to-morrow night
here, and then will go south and east.
Mr. Brooks has grown somewhat stout.
His face is bronzed, and he is looking ex
ceedingly well. They will not be in Cali
fornia altogether over two weeks.
MORE CHATTEL-DEALING
Wholesale Landing of Chinese
Women in This City
Yesterday.
The Notorious Lee Gee of Forged,
Opium Stamp Fame in Business
Again.
. i â  â  â â  .
-Collector of the Port John H. Wise is
evidently, being hoodwinked by some one.
During the past three months no less than
sixteen Chinese women have been_landed
by the Chinese bureau, and of . that num
ber fourteen ' are now in Chinese dens.
Almost all of them were 7 passed by
the Collector as "native , daughters," but
the evidence that supports, their claim is
all that of their own countrymen.
The whole scheme to beat the Govern- \
ment and so get slaves into Chinatown
will be revealed in a few days and the Col
lector will then wonder that he ; was ever
so credulous. Little Pete and Lee Gee,
who came into prominence when Internal
Revenue Agent B. M. Thomas' name was
forged oh the revenue stamps, are rivals
for the control of the slave trade and each
is telling tales- on the other. -When" the
Gaelic arrived from Hongkong a few days
ago she had ; seven women aboard, all of
wHora were said to be wives of -merchants
or native daughters. When the Rio de
Janeiro got in some weeks ago she had
â three'"' women aboard, all consigned "to
Little Pete.' The , â  Coptic ' brought I five
. women, all of whom were landed, and the
three previous steamers brought two each.
Pete's three women who came on the
Rio de Janeiro were landed yesterday and
two of those on the Gaelic were also given
their liberty. The other five, who are still
detained, will be brought before the Col
lector to-day, and if the Chinese succeed
in carrying out their programme they will
be landed. One thing is 'certain; as long
as the ''native daughter" mill can 7be
worked there .will be no lack of slaves in
Chinatown' -' ' â¢ ' ' (
:'/ Connected with Lee Gee in the business
of landing women is Lee Hoy. These two
and ' Little ' Pete control ' the business, but
latterly there has been a split and now each
side is ready to sacrifice the other. In the
meantime very few women will be landed
in San Francisco, and by the â  time the im- j
portations begin again Collector Wise will
probably ? have '. learned ; something of the
inside y workings of ; the gang. yy Of 7 the
women now on the Gaelic Lee Gee and Lee
Hoy have an interest in every one, and
should they- succeed in landing them the
market price of c > the girls would be $1250.
The chances are that the Gaelic will take
them back to China: - - 7 ....

BREEDING A PESTILENCE
Sanitary Conditions Along and
Around Islais Creek
Are Bad.
BOARD OF HEALTH SHOULD ACT.
Sewers Find Outlets Along the Prin
cipal Streets and Run Entirely
at Large.
â¢ The filthy sanitary condition of that
section of San Francisco known :as San
Bruno road and its tributary settlements
is such that the Board of â  Health should
look into the matter at once, before the
hot weather comes on and hatches the
germs of " disease that are â¢ now reposing
dormant in the garbage and butcher-shop
refuse i scattered _ in profusion along the
shore line of the bay. .' â¢ XX/%
7The Southern Pacific Company has
built up an embankment across the bay
on Kentucky street and the ebb and' flow
tide is permitted only to come and go
through a culvert not ;â  more than twenty
five feet wide. 77
This embankment more properly a
' roadbed for the electric cars going over *io
South San Francisco serves the double
purpose of shutting off navigation up
Islais Creek and at the same time makes a
dumping ground for the butchers and tan
ners. When the wind blows from the
south and southwest a sickening odor of
decayed meat comes across the low swamp
and heads for San Francisco's more popu
lated districts, where it certainly spreads
disease and pestilence, to spy nothing of
the alarming possibilities right on the
ground.
Army street, running due west from Ken
tucky, is lined on either side by strips of
water that threaten to become stagnant in
warm weather, and which at the present
time is discolored : with refuse from the |
slaughter-houses.
At the end of Army street, where it
comes into San Bruno road, a sewer finds
its outlet and the ordor is something ter
rific, particularly on a still day when the
stench curls up into the atmosphere like
heat waves, "and compels a passer-by to
grab his nose ana make haste toward a
fresh-air belt.
The |Cortland-avenne sewer breaks out
right at the edge of San Bruno road, and
half of the sewage finds exit in a small box
running under the horsecar track. The
balance becomes an overflow and runs
along the side of the street in front of the
homes of people living in that section.
Residents of that part of . the City have
long complained of the sanitary condi
tions which appear :to reign there and
which are not in the least bit improved by
the placing of the roadway across Ken
tucky street. It confines a great deal of
water that should be freshened by con
tact with the main bay, and is also" a bar
to navigation. 7
There has been something said of this
stream by The Call, but it was never
known before that its practical confine
ment to such narrow outlets and inlets
was so distressing to | the people from a
standpoint of health.
All of the scenes referred to in the fore
going were witnessed by a Call reporter
yesterday, who made the round of that
part of the City in the company of Peter
T. Seculovich, president of the Pennsyl
vania Avenue and Islais Creek Property
owners' Association.
Mr. : Seculovich claims that the creek
should be opened up to navigation so that
the now worthless and pestilential smamp
could be used to the advantage of the
property-owners along its course and made
healthy by freedom of flowing and im
provements. He also maintains that the
sewage from Cortlandt avenue could bo
easily disposed of by conveying it through
a big pipe running along the verge of
Islais Creek directly into the bay. The
makeshift method proposed by means of
a wooden "box" he considers an outrage,
the more so as it is proposed to have the
"box" empty into the creek, which is
private property.

FATHER NUGENT`S
CASE IN COURT.
The Priest Alleged to Have
Exercised Undue In
fluence
AND PROFITED THEREBY.
Mrs. Ellen Gallagher Transferred
$140,000 to Him Without
Receipt.
HEIRS SEEK TO RECOVER.
Defense Claims That the Deceased De
sired to Erect a Church in
St. Rose's Parish.
The trial of the case of P. J. White, spe
cial administrator of the estate of Ellen
Gallagher, deceased, against Rev. Father
Denis Nugent was begun yesterday morn
ing before Judge rut. The suit is
brought at the instance of the heirs of
Thomas and Ellen Gallagher. They are
Peter and James Collins, Margaret Col
lins, Hannah Kelly and James McCullom.
They seek to recover $140,000, which they
allege that Father Nugent, by the exercise
of undue influence, secured from decedent's
estate for his own benefit and of that of
the church. Archbishop Riordan is made
a party to the suit, as the church property
within the diocese stands in his name as
its head. Much interest is manifested in
the case because of its peculiar charac
ter. Both sides exhausted all their chal
lenges before the jury was secured, the
effort on the one side being to secure as
many members of the Catholic church on
th* panel as they might, while the other
Bide sought to exclude these. Henley it
Costello represented the plaintiffs and
Garber, Boalt & Bishoo and William T.
Baggett represented the plaintiff and
John F. Harlan certain of the individual
heirs; Reddy. Campbell & Metson, Stan
ley, Hayes & Bradley and Jones & O'Don
nell the defendants.
The jury was secured by neon. Those
called were questioned by th. prosecution
as to whether they were interested in any
society, the object of which was antagonis
tic to the Roman Catholic church. On the
other side Mr. Henley wanted to know if
they had any delicacy as to sitting in the
trial of a case where a priest was a party
defendant.
Among the talesmen who were chal
lenged was B. Noble, who admitted that
he was a member of the American Protec
tive Association, but declared that that
fact would have no effect upon his judg
ment of the evidence. He was not accepted
however. A. L. Strauss said he had read
about the case in the California World.
He belongs to no church, he said, but his
folks are Catholic. He was accepted.
Following is the jury empaneled: J. R.
McGuffick, G. A.Davis, Thomas A. Nunan,
W. E. Lovejov, M. H. Morris, R.Lee, B.
F. White, F. G. Fraser, M. J. Welch Jr.,
M. J. Siderman, J. H. Seller, A. L.
Strauss.
Of these there are two professing mem
bers of the Catholic Church, Thomas Nu
nan and M. J. Welch.
Barclay Henley opened the case for the
plaintiffs, ln ma address he said that
Thomas Gallagher died in January, 181 _,
leaving an estate worth $190,000 in stocks,
cash and realty. He lived near St. Mary's
Hospital, and was on intimate terms with
Denis Nugent, a Catholic priest. He nomi
nated Nugent as executor of his will with
out bonds. His wife and Kingston were
also executors, but Nugent was tha active
one among themâ he did all the work"
practically alone. Denis had a brother
John, pastor of the church near where
Gallagher lived. - Thomas Gallagher left
property to his wife worth $147,000.
Alter Mr. Gallagher's death he said that
the friendship between his wife and Nu
gent increased. He and his brother John
and a sister Margaret were almost her
only friends. Soon after her hus
band's death Ellen decided to sell tho
property, Nos. 313 and 315 Kearnv street.
The sals realized $.1,500. Denis Nugent,
he said, managed the sale and the money
was turned over to him. Then $21,000 was
realized from the sale of certain stock, and
this was turned over to him for the pur
pose of building a church. In ail he said
that Mrs. Gallagher gave the priest "sums
of money aggregating between $130,000
and $150,000. No written acknowledg
ments of any kind were made concerning
these transfers. These transfers were not
known by Gallagher's heirs until after
Ellen Gallagher's death, and then Nugent
made it known. . To be sure, he had some
receipts, but they are not witnessed and
are in his own-handwriting. One of these
was written by him two or three days be
fore the death of Ellen Gallagher and
while she was on her deathbed. This re
ceipt represents the transfer of no less
than $30,000. These two priests and their
sister, said counsel, were the only ; persons
who knew about this, and when Father
Nugent gave them the information he.did
so as a secret.
Mrs. Gallacher was intensely religious.
According to Mr. Henley her house was
fitted with all manner of religious decora
tion, and in her bedroom she had an altar.
Every morning she spent something like
an hour in the chapel, and then she would
spend several hours on her knees before
the altar in her room, and in the evening
she would go again to the chapel. She
saw her relations only at rare intervals.
She was penurious. "Her monthly ex
penses did not amount to over $40. She
was taken sick about a week before she
died, and Margaret Nugent was her nurse
and attendant during all her last illness.
She died in April. During the preceding
December she had conveyed a piece of
property to Miss Nugent. 7 Just before her
death she had parted with all her estate
except $50,000, half of which was in cash
and half in real estate. All the remainder
she had turned over to the priest. She
deeded some property to the Archbishop.
She made a will leaving her relatives sev
eral bequests. She had received from the
court since her husband's death $500 or
$600 a month, in all amounting to about
$10,000. This was put out to interest, but
what it has netted is not known. Mr.
Henley said the plaintiffs would show the
jury that the priest's influence, interpos
ing the claims of the church, had led Mrs.
Gallagher to forget her own people, and
that if she had been left to herself she
would have remembered her Kindred. -
Daniel Black was the first witness called.
It was he that purchased the Kearny-street
property referred to. He said he effected
the trade with Father Nugent. Mrs. Gal
lagher turned the entire matter over to the
priest. - . -
Joseph Toner,* a relative, testified to the
pious and devout ; character .of Mrs. Gal
lagher, that her house was fitted up with
many religious emblems, an altar, etc.
Mrs. * Margaret Dugan, a nurse, who had
been called in on the Friday preceding the
Monday on which Mrs. Gallagher died,
testified that Father Denis Nugent, his
brother John and his sister were * there,
also .'Sister Mary B. Russell, mother su
perior of St. Mary's Hospital.
Here the trial ended for the day. The
defense, it is stated,' will undertake to
show that Mrs. Gallagher in all she did
was simply carrying out the wishes of her
husband and that there was no undue in
fluence exerted in the matter, that it was
a part of her ambition to build a church in
St. Rose's parish, the name of the donor
being withheld until the dedicatory ser
vice. - ' TX '-."â '-; -'
Father Nugent sat .behind his counsel
(.during the day, smilingly interested in all
that took place. Sister Mary Russell, lady
superior of the Sisters of "Mercy at St.
Mary's Hospital, was also present. She is
the sister of Lord Russell of Killowen,
Lord Chief Justice of England.
The trial will be resumed this morning.
CRABS AND CLAMS.
An Exchange of Shell Fish for Northern
and Southern Waters.
-Within the next few weeks the Fish
Commissioners will undertake the propa
gation of two food shell fish in waters that
for some reason they have never thrived
in heretofore. The fishermen in San
Pedro Bay, who furnish fish for Los Ange
les and neighboring towns, have never
been able to net large crabs such as are
found in the waters of San Francisco and
Monterey bays and along the northern
coast. They are very anxious to secure
this shellfish and have asked the Com
missioners to send a lot to them for breed
ing purposes. Their wish will be granted
and the Commissioners will soon send
from 600 to 1000 large crabs to be planted
in the waters of San Pedro Bay. The fish
ermen of Los Angeles have had a county
ordinance passed prohibiting the taking
of crabs for two years.
In exchange the southern county fish
ermen will send to the Commissioners
large consignments of the "razor back"
clam that is so abundant along tbe south
ern bays, but is unknown in the northern
waters. These clams are delicious and
are eaten on the half shell like oysters.
The Commissioners will plant the razor j
backs in the waters of San Francisco, I
Monterey and Tamales bays. SeVeral
years ago Commissioner Emeric planted a
number of these clams in a slough in
Contra Costa County and they have done
well. There is no reason, so far as can be
seen, why they will not thrive all along
this section of the coast. . The- strange
feature is that the two varieties of shell
fish have never worked their way along
the entire coast.
MORE WILMERDING SITES
Other Offers for the School
Expected by University
Regents,
Professor Schaeberle to Conduct the
- Astronomical Expedition
to Japan.
The board of regents of the University
of California met yesterday afternoon at
the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art on
Nob Hill and settled what was a quantity
of minor business compared with the two
important matters they concluded to take
more time to decide.
The first choice of a site for the Wil
merding Industrial School wa s deferred at
the req,u__t of the committee, which asked
for further time, as it expects more sites to
be offered. It was intimated that an ex
tension might be asked on M ayor Sutro's
offer limited to thirty days of nearly a
block of land, but the necessity for prompt
action was emphasized, particularly as one
offer, a block in 'Berkeley, had been with
drawn because of the long delay.
As to the five plans for the group of
three buildings for the Affiliated Colleges
the committee in charge of their examina
tion announced that it would be necessary
to make a more detailed and careful study â¢
of them, and that a choice would be made
not later than February 19, and perhaps
earlier. Then it will be in order for the
board to ratify the choice. Next the State
Board, consisting of the Governor and the
Attorney-General, must concur before bids
may be advertised for. And here again,
as in the site for the. Wilmerding School,
there is necessity for prompt action in or
der to come within the time limit, after
which the State appropriation if not ex
pended lapses. . , , * ...-;â ' /;.- -
J. B. Mhoon, attorney for the board,
reported that he had examined the title of
the land given by Mayor Sutro as a site for
the Affiliated Colleges, and -that in his
judgment as soon as one remaining small
lien on the property shall have Been can
celed the title will be perfect. ' He found
there were three liens. But one of $6000,
incorrectly quoted as $20,000, Mayor Sutro
has personally agreed to assume. Another
has been abandoned through the instiga
tion of Mr. Sutro's lawyer, and the third
will very soon be settled for good. .'.../

ENCOURAGING LETTER READ.
7 ,
The Members Urged to; Devote Them
selves to the Constitutional
Amendment. ;'
The meeting of the State Woman's
Suffrage Association, held in the parlors
of Golden Gate Hall yesterday afternoon,
was honored by the presence of Miss Lucy
Anthony, niece of Miss Susan B. Anthony
and private secretary to Rev. Anna Shaw,
and also by the presence of Rev. Kate
Hughes of Illinois. It was one of the most
enthusiastic meetings ever held by the as
sociation. y .Xy:yXy XyyyXv y
Mrs. Ellen Sargent, the president, pre
sided, and after the secretary had disposed
of some routine business she read the fol
lowing from the Woman's Tribune of the
25th of last month, which called forth loud
and prolonged applause :
Mrs. Jennie L. Munroe, in her able address
on trades unions before the January meeting
of the District of Columbia Woman Suffrage.
Association, recounted the action of the
Knights of Labor upon a resolution sent to
them from the suffrage society. Mrs. Munroe
said:
"This society, at a special meeting called for
the purpose, appointed a committee of three
members to draft a resolution and present the
same to the said convention and request its
adoption. I will give resolution here:
"Inasmuch as your organization makes 110 dis
tinction between men and women in the rights,
duties and privileges pertaining thereto, and since
your platform demands equal pay for equal work,
without regard to sex, and at various times you
have adopted resolutions favoring women's po
litical enfranchisement;
â¢â¢Therefore, the District Woman's Suffrage Asso
ciation respectfully urge you. In Instructing your
assemblies to direct their Congressmen to secure
legislation restoring suffrage to the district, to re
quest that the demand be made for all citizen,
without distinction of sex."
Mrs. Dr. Brackett, Miss Glllctt and the writer
of this paper composed that committee. Those
ladies could tell you how wo were received,
how the resolution-was passed, in our pres
ence, without debate and by a rising vote, but
it remains tor me to tell you that was the first
time in the history of the order such a thing
was done by a general assembly.
It Is a very deliberate body, and it carefully
looks into all questions it votes upon, but this
matter of the right of women to the franchise
has been acknowledged by the majority of the
order so long it needed no explanation.
A letter from A. B. McGaffey, Secretary
of State, was also read and received with
much enthusiasm. In this the writer says:
There has been nothing to regretâ there is
nothing to regretâ Colorado's experience
with women in politics. On the contrary
there have been many gratifying results.
There have been no startling or revolution
ary changes, but as we study the situation
"before" and "after" taking we see that there
has . been a change, and that it nas been in
every way for the better.
Women generally take quite as deep an in
terest and active a part in politics here as do
the men, and I think I am safe in saying that
fully as large a percentage of theiu'go to the
polls and vote.
I trust that the women of California will be
successful In their efforts to secure that unde
niable right of citizenship, "equality before
the law," and I know that if they do your State
will be the better for it.
Since Colorado has had universal suffrage
there has undoubtedly been a distinct im
provement in the moral tone of politics.
Woman's influence has been felt as it conld
not be felt. Primaries, conventions, public
meetings, elections, all have quietly and al
i most unconsciously, though none the less effec
j tively, been molded by her presence â
more orderly and less liable to take chances in
the nomination of candidates unworthy of the
fullest confidence of the people.
The Rev. : Mrs. Hughes spoke at some
length in the cause of suffrage for women
and among other things declared that it
was cruel that 12,000,000 women should be
deprived of those rights which belong to
them, and deprived through the power of
a class that is not conversant with the
government of this country and its laws.
She urged the women of California to
work for the proposed amendment to the
constitution of this State, which, if car
ried, will give women the right which be
longs to them. .7,. '
Mrs. Krebs addressed the. meeting on
the subject of the laws of this State, hold
ing that they are in many ways more lib
eral to women than are those of other
States, but notwithstanding their liberality
they will stand considerable amendment.
She urged the women not to turn from the
object that should occupy their attention
at this time, the proposed amendment,
and devote themselves exclusively to that.
"Do not talk now about what you would
do when you get the ballot, -wait- till you
get it, then you may talk about what you
will do."
She said it was no argument for those
opposed to universal . suffrage to say
"women will not vote," because it is a
well-known fact that many men, good
men, do not trouble themselves to vote.
Women, she said, want to vote, and when
tbey are entitled to the franchise tneir
vote will, in proportion, be equal to that
of the men. She also urged that women
should educate themselves as to what the
ballot means.
Mrs. Louise Sorbier entered into a long
explanation of the law of' this State so far
as they affect the rights of women in prop
erty, and then told of her efforts at Sacra
mento in behalf -of woman suffrage and
now the legislators asked what grievance
they had, and little by little; amended the
law to the advantage of women. The laws
of this Stale, while not perfect, she said,
are not so bad as they are in some States,
She said that at Sacramento she saw in
the legislative halls men of â¢ a character
that she did not care to name as represen
tatives from this City and was told that
these individuals: in representing : their
wi-es represented the interests of women,
and she asked, "Can such men be good
fathers?" She said that if women are al
lowed to vote they wili. give the people a
good government. .
Mrs. Emma Gregory . showed that the
courts of this State nav*e declared that be
cause the husband does not take his wife's
earnings by ; so; doing he is supporting
her, because what she earns is commun
ity property, and she cited a case in which
that doctrine was held.
Colonel P. : , T. Dickinson of Alameda,
Mrs. Johnson and several others addressed
the meeting and the tone of their remarks
evinced their interest in the cause.
â  Miss Lucy Anthony, who had been a si
lent listener, -was called to ; the platform
and expressed her regret that she was un
able to address an assemblage, but she ex-
I plained that a lady in Washington had of
fered $5 to have Nellie Bly pointed out to
her, and that this contribution was subse
quently appropriated as a contribution to
the California campaign fund. .
XX After the meeting - Miss Anthony said
that she will remain oil this coast for some
.time,, perhaps ; three a. months, ' perhaps
more, to arrange ;â  dates _ for f Rev. 7 Anna
Shaw.- Her aunt, she thought, would not
talk much this year. She expressed her
self as very much delighted with the feel
ing manifested at the meeting.

Will Retire on Saturday.
/ Ambrose Watson, as popular 7 and : effi

position, will submit to the decision of
Judge Troutt by retiring from office on
Saturday next. >
"I will appeal to the Supreme Court,"
he said yesterday, ''as I still believe that
my contention is right. I don't see the
use, however, of working here : any longer

prised at the decision, but I believe it will

Watson was the recipient yesterday of
numerous expressions of regret from
friends at the decision being against him,
and the hope was general that his fight for
principle would yet be crowned with suc
cess.
A. L. Morgenstern, son of Supervisor
Morgenstern, will assume the duties of
Police Court clerk of Judge Conlan's court
on Monday. He has been drawing the sal
ary of $200 a month regularly since his ap

ANGLING AND SHOOTING
Result of Last Sunday's Charge
on the Fishes of Paper-
Mill Creek. _ ,
An Ordinance That Will Stop Fishing
With Nets in Mendocino County
Streams.
One hundred anglers who wore sorrow
and disappointment in their features re
turned on Sunday evening from Point
Reyes, to which place they had > journeyed
in the hope of catching some of the many
steelheads that were supposed to have been
loafing in the deep pools of the stream be
low tide-water mark.
All kinds of lures were used, but the
"educated" trout of the Paper-mill would
not acknowledge the presence of the mo3t
tempting bits of beautiful red roe or
shrimp impaled on decorated hooks, which
wore the appearance of the setting sun.
John Benn, the famous dresser of trout
flies, was among the distinguished disciples
of Walton who fished in vain for silvered
denizens of the creek.
"I cannot understand," said Benn, "why
those fish positively refused to sample
some of the good things that were proffered
them. I can account for this strange con
duct on the part of the fishes in one or two
'ways. In the first place, they may have
had a big feast on Tomales Bay clams be
fore they entered the streams and nad no
appetite for nick-nacks, and, in the second
place, they may have received some infor
mation concerning the army of anglers
that was expected at the point on Sunday
and held an indignation meeting ending
with an unanimous promise not to sample
a thing on Sunday, and they proved loyal
to their pledge." ' .'..-/:
Experience has demonstrated beyond
argument that steelhead fishing in the
tide waters of the Paper-mill Creek is
â¢growing annually worse, and old anglers of
long experience contend that unless the
breeding fishes are protected there will not
be any remaining to speak of in a few
years hence.
â¢The fact that 150 rods which were
handled by anglers on the ' Paper-mill last
Sunday scored nothing at the end of the
day's trials proves conclusively that the
anglers have not proven very destructive
to the fishing interests of the stream. It
is the netting that is done in j Tomales Bay
and the spearing that is quietly accom
plished above tide water that is destroying
the sport of anglers, and unless the Fisn
Commissioners, as* previously stated, will
detail a deputy to look after the coast
; streams during the months of February
and March the anglers may whistle for
sport when the trout-fishing season opens.
A letter was received at this office yester
day from Glen Ellen which states that
spearing salmon 7- trout in the Sonoma
Creek near the town of Glen Ellen is a
: daily pastime and that the constables are
afraid to make arrests 5 because such a
thing as arresting- a man for spearing
steelheads would injure - their standing
politically. .
The Fish Commissioners say that their
funds are exhausted and that they cannot
afford to detail a deputy permanently to
watch the streams that are fished by local
anglers in the angling season. ; â¢ â 
The Sonoma and Panermill creeks
should be closely protected, as they are the
principal waters.whipped by anglers dur
ing the fishing season. â¢ It is expected that
the commissioners will not neglect to stock
them occasionally with some of ihe many
millions of young fishes that are now in
the State hatcheries. 7
Deputy Al Wilson and his friend Mr.
Cross returned from j Duncans Mills Sun
day evening, after having made another
successful raid on ; Pennies nets, two of
which they captured last Thursday morn
ing near the mouth of the Russian River.
"I .nnie may be under the impression
that Wilson is not attending to his busi
ness," * said Mr. Cross, "but -r have good
reason to believe that he has changed his
mind on j that point, as Wilson has made
four successful raids on his nets, which are
now : housed in Santa Rosa. Since net
fishing has been stopped at the mouth of
the Russian River : thousands of steel
heads are now spawning 'in the streams of
Mendocino and Sonoma counties, which
were barren of fish during the years that
the fishermen : were 7 allowed to net the
breeding fishes at the mouth of the river."
Deputy Davis *". returned y from X. Point
Arena last Saturday and reports that owing
to a verbal war that has been pending for
some time between the sportsmen and the
net fishermen a local ordinance has ' been
passed, which has put a stop to -fishing
witn nets in or above the tide waters of the
Garcia, Navarro, Gualala and Little rivers.
It is to be hoped that the ordinance will re
main in force, permanently, as the rivers
mentioned are among the grandest in this
State for trout fishing if v protected, and
would be visited ;by hundreds of anglers
from this City during the summer months
if the sport was known to be good. ' It is
to the interest of ; the residents of I Point
Arena and vicinity to cater to the sports
men and anglers of this City, who spen<_Â»
thousands of dollars during their summer
vacations where they find good fishing
and shooting. v7.y-

S. Stratton, the acting attorney, told the
board that the Chief Wharfinger had full
power to move a vessel whenever and
wherever he pleased, so long as she was
within the jurisdiction of the commission.
When Superintendent Grey began to argue
the point President Colnon told him that
while he had the interests of the port at
heart he wanted the towboat owners to
understand that they were only docking
ships on sufferance, and that the Harbor
Commissioners could stop their operations
at any time. yy
The discussion was started by the read
ing of a letter from Williams, Dimond &
Co., in which the attention of the board
was called to the fact that the Seafarer was
moved by the tug Rescue just about the
time the Roanoke was nearing the dock.
The Chief Wharfinger said he had notified
the captain of the tugboat not to move
the Seafarer, and Captain Grey said his
men could receive orders from no one but
himself. The captains were not allowed
to take any risks and were only sent to
work when the tides and other circum
stances suited. *
; "But you were not asked to take any
risk in this case," said Commissioner Cole.
"All you were asked to do was to keep
still." "
Then the cross-fire began. Grey said it
was the first time in his experience of twenty
years that he had ever known the Chief-
Wharfinger to undertake the docking of a
ship. Chadbourne said it was the first
time necessity had ever arisen. Cap
tain Harvey of the Rescue said he had re
ceived orders to move the Seafarer at. a
given time and that the order had never
been rescinded. He followed his instruc
tions, and knew nothing about any trouble
with the Roanoke. Chief Wharfinger
Root said he was afraid of an accident,
and had sent word by his chief deputy
not to move the ship. Chief Assistant Short
said he had yelled at Captain Harvey, and
the latter turned his back on him. He
t_,en notified the captain of the Seafarer,
and the latter told him that he was master
of the ship and- not of the tug.
At this point matters began to get inter
esting and President Colnon had to pre
serve order. Captain Harvey denied ever
having heard or seen Short, and Short re
torted that it was easy not to see or hear
when one didn't want to. "ft was lucky
for you," said he, "that the Seafarer was a
couple of feet away from the wharf and
flying light or else I would have got
aboard and placed you under arrest."
It was then that President Colnon
stopped the discussion and after Superin
tendent Grey had explained that his com
pany had no intention; of breaking the
rules or antagonizing the commission the
matter went over to next Thursday for
further consideration. In the meantime
all of Williams, Dimond & Co.'s ships will
be handled by the Pacific Mail Company's
tug Millen Griffiths.
On her arrival from the Orient the Mail
company's steamer City or Peking is to
be docked for an overhauling at Hunter's
Point. The mud about the entrance has
silted up and the California Drydock Com
pany want the Harbor Commissioners to
dredge it out. Captain Bruce urged that
it would be facilitating the commerce of
the port to do the work \ and said that if
the dredging was not done the company
would have to dock and repair the Peking
at Hong Kong. Captain Hackett also asked
tbat the privilege be granted, but Presi
dent Colnon drew his attention to the fact
that when dredging work around the bat
tle-ship Oregon had to be done the State's
dredgers did it and the bills had not yet
been paid. v
Commissioner Cole was ;in favor of the
board doing the work,- but Attorney Strat
ton said the State dredgers could" not be
employed outside of the jurisdiction of
the board, nor could they be used to assist
a private enterprise. "Then I move that
we follow the law,'.' .aid : Commissioner
Chad bourne, and it was carried, Cole vot
ing "No." .
The question of charging â  the Mare
Island tug Unadilla $5 a month dockage
then came up, and Chadbourne made a
plea on behalf of the officers, who use the
vessel to get to and from "San Francisco.
"We'll follow the law." said Cole, and the
matter was laid over for further considera
tion, but in the meantime the Unadilla
will have to pay $5 a month dockage.
The; supplying of piles for use- on the
front came up. and Roberts & | Matison
offered to ; furnish all the lumber required
at 10 cents a foot. 7 S. E. Slade & Co. offered
to supply twelve-inch piles at 11 cents,
fourteen-inch at 123. cents and fifteen-inch
at 13J4 cents, and rough Oregon pine lum
ber at $11 a thousand feet. . The lumber
offer was 7 accepted, but the pile Question
went over to next meeting. .
The * bill for dredging the mud from
around - the battle-ship Oregon was ' cut
from $900 to $G25, at the request of Captain
Hackett. He showed that while the State
charged him | $100 a day for the use of the
dredger, he only got $650 for the entire job.
.The appointment of E. R. Swain to suc
ceed A. Page Brown, as architect for the
â¢new ferry building, was confirmed.

The bunko man who has recently been
working financially on the fraternal feel

Waterloo Monday night. He met with a
genuine surprise after he had â¢ rung " the*;
bell at the residence of George Cumming
Jr. of the Pacific Improvement Company,
and he sought the sidewalk when he had
ended a brief interview with Mr. Cum
ming. , His downward flight was after the
manner of ran I elderly lady shooting the
chutes. *
â  Several of those employed at :' the _ im
provement company's â¢ offices are Berkeley

arid before he left for home Monday even
ing he listened to one or two stories tola by?
his confreres of j; their losses through sym
pathy for this mythical nephew, cousin or
intimate friend. yy- ; : ':
> Mr. Cumming went home in a thought
ful mood,- cogitating, it is supposed, on the
gullibility of the educated brain, and soon
after he had finished nis dinner the door
| bsll rang. A gentleman stood outside and j
courteously presented a letter. Mr. Cum-
ming, X. who â  took \ it, thinking it to be a
letter of recommendation, politely asked
the stranger to step inside.
The stranger did so. y He was a young
man of good appearance and while Mr.
Cumming broke the envelope he felt a
friendly feeling, growing manifest in him;
The letter was written in a hand that he
could not recollect, but it was written in a
businesslike way. ' ' X .
Mr. Cumming perused, the letter in
silence, the stranger looking on, blandly,
the while.
i Suddenly Mr. Cumming started so vio
lently that the stranger jumped toward
the door in alarm. .
"You' arc* a nephew of ray mend that
graduated with me in. '81, are you?" yelled
Mr. Cumming in , a voice that startled a
patrolman on the next beat. . "You are a
relation of mv dear friend, hey?" he con
tinued in a gradually increasing volume of
tone. f . *.'-."' X,'- 'â '''"-'-â  \.
The stranger nodded his head energetic
ally at each question and stuttered, "Yes,

At this Doint Mr. Cumming 's language
became incoherent and his words were in
distinct and untranslatable. -; y-_ - y
"You infernal, blankety, blahk, blank,
blank, get out 7of this blankety, blank
quick!" he howled. _, _
A few moments later silence settled
down over the neighborhood of Mr. Cum
ming's house. A solitary pedestrian on
the opposite side of the street observed a
black heap lying at the foot of Mr. Cum- j
ming's front steps. After a time this heap j
arose and a crouching figure stole away in i
the darkness.
That same evening soon after Mr. Cum
ming had calmed down somewhat his
sister-in-law, Miss Bragg, who is a gradu
ate of Berkeley, came to him with a letter
from a stranger in this City which she had \
received that morning.
. , 'George,'' said she, "only think, a dear
friend of Miss â â -, who graduated with us

A BENEFIT TO THE STATE.
What J. A. Filcher Accomplished
at the Recent Atlanta
Fair.
His Report to the State Board of
Trade Heartily Indorsed.
The Finances.
There was a well-attended and interest
ing meeting of the California State Board
of Trade yesterday, at- which the following
members were present:
J. S. Emery, Mrs. M. E. Shields, C. M.
Wooster. W. H. Mills, Colonel J. P. Irish,
N. W. Spaulding, B. M. Lelong, R. X.
Ryan, L. C. McAfee, J. A. Morrissey, E.
W. Maslin and I. H. Thomas. 7
This was the first meeting held since
the return of J. A. Filcher, who so success
fully carried on the California exhibit at
the late Atlanta Exposition. Much of the
time was consumed in discussing the
features of the big fair and the medals and
honors won by exhibitors of the Golden
West. -..,/,: ....
Mr. Filcher presented along, interesting
report or all that had been accomplished
since the exhibition proposition came up
nearly a year ago. His account of the cost
to the board of sending the exhibit to At
lanta was received with keen attention.
In it Mr. Filcher says :
I referred to the fact that only $5400 was
available for the Atlanta Exposition. lam
pleased to soy that with the concessions pre
viously named" (from the railroad) and by
practicing the closest economy, where it could
be done without impairing the efficiency of the
work, the expenditures will not exceed that
amount. When I left California I carried with
me $1500; I subsequently drew $1500 more.
In addition to this I received for work done
for others and from sales and salvage $211 59,
and from returned freight charges $97 40,
making the total that has come into my hands
since leaving for Atlanta $3308 99. In return
for this amount I have vouchers for $2538 80.
I have a record of petty expenditures on ac- I
count of exposition work of $445 57 and I i
have cash in hand to the amount of $38 85, I
leaving a balance of $288 77 unaccounted for. j
Tnis balance represents the cost of living- of â¢'
Mr. Johnson, the assistant, and myself during i
our stay at the exposition, and incidental ex- ;
penses on the way there and return, which I !
ask the board to allow.
The total cost of replenishing, packing and ;
loading the exhibit at this end of the line and
after starting was $97 14. This added to
$3273 14, the cost of the work at Atlanta, makes
a total expenditure to date chargeable to the
Atlanta exhibit fund of $4243 2S and leaves a
balance in said fund of $115Â« 72.
This estimate will be ample to reinstall
the exhibit at the new quarters at 16 Post
street, and when that work is done, as I hope
to be able to do it, the State Board of Trade
will be in better shape every way than it was
previous to going to' Atlanta, and it will for its
extra pains and efforts in connection with the
Atlanta Exposition have placed to Its credits
as an aditional and powerful reason for its ex
istence and support, one of the greatest works
ever performed for California, either at home
. or abrood, for a like amount of money.
The report was received with applause
and the board extended to Mr. Filcher a
vote of thanks for the successful manner
in which he managed the entire undertak
ing. Great surprise was . expressed that
the expenses were below the amount esti
mated. Mr. Mills and Colonel Irish stated
more good had been accomplished for this
State by the recent exposition than at the
World's Fair at Chicago, which cost Cali
fornia over $300,000. It was decided to
print and distribute many thousands of
Mr. Filcher _ report. Hundreds of these
reports will be sent to inquirers in the
East, as it contains a vast amount of infor
mation about California.

MORTON STREET
Terror Caused by Several
Attacks on Young .'â¢.'â :
Women.
AS MAY SMITH DIED.
Attempts to Choke and Rob Other
Hibitues of the Region
Reported.
NOT A CLEW YET DISCOVERED.
A Condition of Affairs That Suggests
the Presence of a Morbid
Maniac.
The police are inclined to think that
there is a strangler in this City whose am
bition, or mania, is to equal, or possibly
eclipse, the record of London's notorious
JEWELRY AND PURSE OF THE MURDERED GIRL.
Jack the Ripper, who in the course of a
year or two murdered many fallen women
and terrorized the entire Whitechapel dis
trict of that great metropolis.
It seems as though such were the case,
for within the last few days a young girl
on Morton street has been strangled to
death by an unknown assassin and several
other women in the same region have been
beaten, stabbed and strangled, in each of
the latter cases the assailant escaping
without leaving a trace by which he could
be detected. â¢â¢
/ The night prior to the murder of "little
y.ay Smith," a man bearing the appear
ance of a thug entered the room of a young
girl who had assumed the name of Lulu
Taber on Morton street. After inquiring
as to the amount of money the girl had on
her person and receiving a raply favorable
to him, he became exceedingly rough, tear
ing the girl's clothes from her person in
an endeavor, it is presumed, to rob her.
The girl ordered him out into the street,
but he refused to go, and again assailed
her, but her cries and her threats to call
the police attracted the attention of the
girls in rooms adjoining her, which evi
dently frightened him, as he made a hasty
exit and joined a man waiting on the side
walk, who is supposed to have been his ac
complice.
Both rapidly disappeared down the
street before the officers arrived. A few
hours after this occurrence loud cries were
heard coming from the rooms at 16>_ Berry
street, occupied by a girl who is known as
Carrie Thomas. Upon their arrival the
police found the girl lying on the floor in
an almost insensible condition, badly
bruised and with deep red finger marks on
her neck snowing that she had been stran
gled. A roan, who proved to be John
Kelly, alias Williams, was. endeavoring to
escape through the back door, but through
the interference of a man who happened
to hear the cries, ran into the room and
intercepted him, he whs handed over
to the police.
Standing on the curb outside of the
room was the accomplice, who fled upon
hearing the cries of the girl, but was seen,
and his description answers that given by
Lulu Taber as the man who had a short
while before assailed her. Night before
last another girl was nearly strangled to
death on Berry street, her assailant being
unknown, but it is thought to be the con
federate of the man now in custody. Al
though the police searched high and low,
they were afterward unable to again lo
cate the girl who had been choked. The
girls across tho street from the house
heard the screaming, and after learning
that another attempt had been made upon
the life of one of their associates, they im
mediately left their places for their other
rooms. A number of them have de
termined not to return to their old haunts
until this unknown and dangerous thug
6hall have been taken into custody.
The agents of the houses occupied by
these girls are very reticent about the
matter, it being evident that they are in
danger of losing their tenants if they be
come aware of the attempts made on the
lives of other girls. -
Although a number of girls living on
that street heard the disturbance, but few
of them know tbe truth concerning the
matter. â â¢;.:- â  â¢..-,
MAY SMITH'S BURIAL.
There Was Only a Heart-Broken
Mother to Weep for the Girl. ;
Forsaken by every one but her row
ing mother, Mamie McDermott was buried
yesterday in Cypress Lawn Cemetery.
The unfortunate young woman who was
killed by a strangler on Monday morning
was given as decent and conventional an
interment as money could purchase, but
there lacked all those, tender and senti
mental adjuncts seemingly so natural,
although so sad, in like ceremonies under
different circumstances.
The woman was only .a, trifle ; over 20
years of age when death overtook her.
Yet around her casket there were no chil
dren nor young people in the moral j ac
ceptance of the term. There were women
there, to be sure, whose lives were ; still
young, but whose painted faces and hard
lines told the story of the paths they, like
the dead one/ have followed. V;;; "
The funeral ceremonies, in a religious
9____l__________________________a_i'.
sense, were not observed, and the cortege
was formed in a matter-of-fact way, such
as the carting away of some incumbrance
from one's household. ''â '.'â â â¢- â¢
Jack Smith, the man who has been re
garded for a couple of years as the hus
band of the woman, dropped j in 'to view
her remains and then went his t^ay. In
the evening he was again about his haunts,
where, in the lifetime of the girl, he earned
by gambling enough to lighten her burden
of his keeping.
Curiosity,' as much as anything else, ex
citing the taste of the women of the half
world, attracted many of : them to the
Morgue during the early hours of the day.
They were â¢ disappointed not to find the
body there. They pursued their quest as
far as the undertaker's, to the latter's very
great dissatisfaction.
Now that the poor murdered girl is
buried there is nothine left behind â¢ but
the remembrance of how she was killed.
The public will soon forget that, and it is
likely, too, that the police will have to
inscribe the assassination on their archives
as one of the mysterious cases presented
to them.
A Coroner's jury has been impaneled,
after having viewed the corpse, and its
verdict, if it is ever deemed necessary to
ask it for one, must be that May Smith
came to her death ac the hands of some
person unknown. .: '?.-
The police, however, are not resting be
cause they are in the dark as to the prob
able murderer. Captain Lees has been
working twenty hours out of twenty-four
catechizing every person who might have
a possible connection with the case. '
He has found the cook from San Diego
whose letters to May Smith were signed :
"Billy." The fellow is W. R. Neuman.
He accounts for his movements ever since
Ihe arrived in this City last Friday. He
| acknowledges the interest he felt in May
i Smith at one time, but that was some
months ago, and since then, since he
I visited San Jose, he has transferred his
j ephemeral love to another.
He has been allowed to depart in peace,
j and so has Charles Lemarrer, the loqua
j cious barber whose drunken volubility got
! him into trouble. Lemarrer declared that
! he had had trouble with a denizen of the
tenderloin and had choked her late Mon
day morning. It was over a 50-"cent
piece she had abstracted from his pocket.
This turned out to be true, but Captain
Lees has learned that the woman in ques
tion was not the murdered one.
The latest development in the case is the
discovery of some long black hairs caught
in the vestment UDon the woman after she
was taken to the morgue. This slight clue
is accepted in the sense that her murderer
was not one of the blonde* men who was
last seen with her at 10:55 o'clock Sunday
night. 7 V"'. 7 X'X.y-XyX-.y
The girl was known to always have a
little money about her or her room, as
well as considerable jewelry, and it is be
lieved that the murderer was well ac
quainted with these facts, which prompted
him to do the killing.,
TENOR GTTILLE.
Something About the Great Tenor With
the Tavary Company.
Among the distinguished members of
the Tavary Opera - Company is Albert L.
Guille, the celebrated tenor of the Patti
concerts of America.
Guille was born in Avignon, France, in
1854 and studied with the great tenor,
Audran, father of the famous' composer
of "The Mascot", and "Olivette."- He has
had a most remarkable- and interesting
career, one that would read like a romance
more than a history of real life. M. Guille
has sung in all the leading theaters of
Europe, including those of the Russian
empire, with all the greatest artists of the
age.
For six seasons he was with Patti, and
for three years he was court sineer for the
King of Portugal, Dom Luis I, by 7 whom
he was created "Chevalier of the Legion of
Christ," _ a Portuguese. military order, a
favor conferred only upon , the most dis
tinguished personages, and which Mons.
Guille received under the most flattering
and complimentary circumstances. r t'-,.v7i._;
From his profits on the stage Guille has
built a castle near Geneva. Switzerland,
with all the latest American improvements'
and at a cost of $30,000. He has a; family
of three children, and' four years ago he
engaged an American governess and sent
her to Europe to educate them . in the
language and ways of "Uncle Sam." Guille
is a great admirer of America, â¢ where he
made many friends, and "- he says frankly
that of all the audiences he has ever sung
for, the Americans are the most intelligent
and appreciative.
His greatest operas are "The Huguenots,"
"Faust,',' "Aida," . "Pagliacci,". "L'Afri
caine," and the great production, "The
Jewess,';", in which as the old Jew he en
trances every body.7 7 Even his associates on
the stage tremble at. the dramatic inten
sity of his interpretation. " "
Science, in Kissing.
The reason. kissing is 60 pleasant, says
an osculatory expert -of scientific tenden
cies, is .because*, the , teeth, jawbones and
lips are full of nerves, tnd when the lips
of persons meet an electric current is
generated, and, to put 7 it; facetiously, you
don't have to have a dynamo "machine "nor
a battery in the house, nor a call-box nor a
button to touch to ring up the central
oflice, and there is no patent on it, and the
poorest person in the world can enjoy the
electric current better than the millionaire,
and it never gets out of order. â :. If j Edison
had invented kissing it would cost $100 a
year, like the telephone, and then extra
kissing would be charged up extra, and if
you did 7 not -pay/ for. it they would come
and disconnect you from the central office.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1896.
CATHOLIC LITERATURE.
Rev. James McDonald Lectures
Before the Reading
Circles.
HIS PLEA FOR GOOD BOOKS.
In the Course of an Able Essay the
Lecturer Points Out a Way
in Reading.
Metropolitan Hall was crowded last
night when the Rev. James McDonald of
St. Peter's Church delivered a lecture be
fore the Catholic reading circles on
"Catholic English Literature."
I Father McDonald read his lecture, which
was distinguished for its smooth, agreeable
style and an undercurrent of humor. He
quoted extensively to illustrate' his dis
course.
He said that there never was a time
â¢ when so much writing was done, so much
indifferent if not indeed bad writing was
inflicted upon the people. None of this
writing was great. The present century
opened in a blaze of literary, glory. The
French revolution had an influence upon
the thought of the period. Religion, mor
ality, reverence, virtue were cast aside and
large promises were made in the name of
liberty and equality.
All Europe caught the fever of the
thought. â¢ â¢
The movement crossed the English
Channel. The English literature of the
time is crowned with many great names,
begining it might be said with Burns.
The last half of the century has only one
name to boast â Tennyson whom
there has appeared no great poet. Writers
of perfect style may to-day be counted by
the thousands, and yet few who are the
equal of Hall. Came for instance can be
found. He continued: y
Modern literature is decidedly unhealthy,
breaking- out here h nd there into fits of
nastlness and indecency. The modern story
teller delights in such, and the reader has to
accept it in the name of art.
What wonder is it that people who believe
in justice, truth and old-fashioned virtue
should be satisfied with nothing higher, ana
should not cry out against such a rising tide of
filth.
What can be done about it?- Some people
say read Catholic literature. What is this
literature? It was Cardinal Newman's. The
phrase does not mean religious literature
treating exclusively of Catholic matters or
Catholic doctrine, but consists of literature as
a Catholic would treat it. < The Catholic
church is full of its own literature. The most
startling disclosure of modern times is the ig
norance of Catholic doctrinal works on the
partof Protestant men of pretended literary
reputation. When Catholic literature is men
tioned it should be understood that it is not
necessarily a pious literature. People who
think so arc a little bigoted and want a Catho
lic hallmark on everything.
The speaker said he wished to refrain
from hurting the feelings of any person or
any aggregation of persons, and he hoped
that no offense would be taken where none
was intended. He held that the sodality
COMPOSITE GUNBOAT FOR THE NAVY BEING BUILT AT THE UNION IRON WORKS.
tyrannized over Catholics in regard to
Catholic literature; it was the chief ob
struction to a Catholic literary movement.
And yet sodalities were good in .them
selvesâwhen they kept out of Catholic
literature. Father McDonald cited one
instance of an English writer whose book,
"The: New Antigone,", was not kindly re
ceived rby Catholic critics, one of whom
wrote that it "was not a book fit for the
shelves of ayoung ladies' sodality library."
One is ; inclined nowadays, while hear
ing 'so much ot ; education, to â  look back
with longing to olden times. There are
untold blessings in; the ; ignorance of the
alpbablet. Persons ' weary of civilization
of the schoolmaster and .the tons of mod
ern literature, magazine : and otherwise ;
and then they well may long for "a lodge
in some vast wilderness," with only one
weaponâ the jawbone of 'an ass to kill the
first schoolmaster that comes along. * ' .
Still the speaker said he did not wish his
audience to think that he was opposed to
education. On the -contrary, he believed
in it. But if education -be wanted, a large
latitude must be given the reader and the
writer. .7 The Catholic church has always
fostered education; and whatever civiliza
tion men now possess is due to the church.
She has never obstructed ':'. the light of
learning or scholarship. At the same time
there have been and are some few members
of the church who have a distrust and sus
picion of profane learning. ; The history of it
began in ; the ; early days of inonasticlsm,
when", monk gave up everything the world
held dear to save his own soul. 7;
; The monk did not teach:butdid penance
and wept for -his; sins. But' in time the
monks became priests, and at first r taught
sacred literature. Very soon, history tells,
"heathenish books" were smuggled into
monasteries, . 7-
The smugglers, if found out, were pun
ished; but withal the ; love of profane lit
erature I spread. in these monasteries. A
story oto exemplify the state of literature
in ' monasteries " of 7 these ' early - days was
told by the speaker. ' /- It was about a monk
named Altsmann who disobeyed his su
periors ;to gain .-'. profane ;-, learning , which
men are now told ,was unknown in. mon
astic institutions.
.; Returning - to ; the sodality; the lecturer
said it had very good reasons \ for classify
ing books; although the now command
mentâthou shalt not read novels pre
posterous. Teach ' people X the , beauty -of
virtue and the ugliness and 7 deformity "l of
viee i and every decent; person can distin
guish between a good and a bad book.
-Catholic literature is badly wanted, but
how is it to be obtained? The classic Eng
lish literature is Protestant, for, with only
three ior four exceptions, the great Eng
lish writers I ate - not Catholics. And yet
Catholics f should have ?, no? reason to :be
ashamed of this fact, for the English penal
laws I absolutely debarred _ Catholics % from
prominence in English literature. It was,
though, no fault of theirs.
1 Catholics should study English literature
from the Protestant masters.^ Protestants
are not ashamed to study the paintings of
Catholic masters in Europe' The lecturer,
speaking of how the work might be doneâ
the work of building up a Catholic English
literatureâ saidjhe would have a school of
Catholic writers, and in it once in a while
a Catholic genius would surely be found. 7 ;
7 Thomas Moore, an' Irishman and a Cath
olic,' never had nor -never will i havel an
equal in lyric poetry. He will remain the
sweetest singer in English literature. Next
in order of merit in the Irish school comes
James Clarence Mangan. , * Had Mangan
first seen the light of day in England his
name would be familiar everywhere now.
All his songs are sad as 7 the sigh of the
the winter's windsâ like his life, that saw
but few gleams of the sun of summer. .:-,*â¢
Morgan's beautiful though Sorrowful
poem ''Twenty Golden Years Ago," was
recited as an example of his genius. The
following verse conveys an idea of its feel
ing:.? "X; Xy .X /;â 
Oh ! how plaintive you would ween I was;
Yet I won'tâ albeit I have a deal
More to wall about than Werner has.
* Did I paint a fifth of what I feel.
Werner's tears were wept for withered flowers;
Mine for withered hopes my scroll of woe
Dates alas! from youth's deserted bowers, -
', y Twenty golden years ago. ,
And . the , poem "Soggarth Aroon" was
given by the speaker, who then turned to
English writers. 7 \X ' ' : - : "' : XX"yx.
There are two poets who, were they not
Catholic, would have been laureatesNew
man ; and Faher. Newman's prose, â / for
beauty, elegance and power, is surpassed
by few writers. r.
7 Alfred Austin, the present poet laureate,
is a Catholic who was educated in Catholic
schools exclusively. yy r
In America there are no penal laws to
enslave * Catholics, no critics to damn
Catholic literary efforts with faint praise.
There are many Catholic writers of emi
nence in America, and among them
Futher Ryan and John Boyle O'Reilly
will be remembered through the ages 7by
men of culture. Father Ryan's poem,
"The Warrior Banner," was recited as a
specimen of the poet priest's poetry.
John Boyle 0 Reilly, an Irishman, a
political felon driven from his native land ,
came among strangers and through his '
genius commanded respect. :
Among writers ofj America the speaker
said he could without cavil give a very
high place to Charles Warren Stoddard.
If any man in America has written imper
ishable English that man is Stoddard.
Few boons in American literature excel
hia "South Se* Idyls." Another writer
worth knowing is James Jefferies Roache,
editor of the Boston Pilot, the author of
two books, which Father McDonald re
commended to the Catholic reading cir
cles. I One of Mr. Roaches poems read by
the speaker gave a good idea of the edi
tor's humor and ability.
The outlook of Catholic literature is
bright and there is very good .reason to
look for great improvement. Catholics
may hope for literary victories in years to
come years which tbe generation of to
day may not hope to see. That glory
Catholics of now* cannot participate in,
but the seeds of it they may sow.

tickets for the Archbishop's lecture would

CHARGES AGAINST LANE.
Carroll Cook Moves to Dismiss the In
dictment. v - y-S'-
Carroll Cook, counsel for Peter F. Lane,
who is now under indictment for felonious
assault,' has filed with Judge Belcher a
motion to dismiss the indictment against
his client. ."
In his motion Cook alleges that- the in
dictment was not found by the concurring
voices of twelve of the members of the
Grand- Jury; that the names of all the
witnesses against Lane were not indorsed
in the indictment. He also contended
that the evidence taken before the Grand
Jury was incompetent, irrelevant, insuffi
cient and illegal. 7 Further, Mr. Cook
claims that the Grand Jury itoelf was im
properly and illegally drawn ; some of its
members are aliens, he says, and preju
diced. He therefore ; asked that - the - in
dictment be dismissed. The motion will
come up for a hearing later.- . > f
The trial â of the information against
Lane,, for a similar offense, will come
before Judge Bahrs on February 14.

The approaching marriage* of ex-Presi
dent Benjamin' Harrison recalls to mind
the extreme deference with which the gen
eral has always regarded the gentler sex.
No more striking illustration of this char
acteristic could be desired than the manner
in which lie conducted himself toward the
defendant in the case of Nancy E. Clem,
charged with murder, in which he was one
of the attorneys for the prosecution. 1
y The time intervening between her arrest
and final discharge was a little over eight
years. 7 ' She was charged 7 with . having
killed JacobYonng and wife at Indianapolis
September 12, 1868, and was tried four times.
Twice ; the ' jury hung r and twice . she was
convicted and sentenced to life imprison
ment, but each time the Supreme Court
came to her rescue and reversed the case.
7 ; After the second trial the case came here
on a change- of venue. : Marion 7 County

ferred :to 7 Mrs. i Clem, "the unfortunate
defendant." 'After 7he closed y Senator
Voorhees, who ' was .associated 7 with the
defense, 5 asked him why ;he 7 had been so
easy in his remarks against the defendant.
"Dan," he replied, "no matter what she
may have done, she is still Ja' woman; and
I won't abuse her." When the jury had
retired he 7 went over ito Mrs. Clem, who
was crying, and asked her forgiveness for
anything he said which might have 5 in
jured her feelings. As he turned away he
said to Judge Palmer, who was "trying the
case: "Judge, I'll never prosecute another

GUNBOATS FOR THE NAVY
Union Iron Works Begin Con
struction of â  Two Com
posites.-
LIGHT DRAUGHT FIGHTERS.
Speed, Sail Area, Armament and Gen
eral Description of the
Craft.;
The Union Iron Works of this City was
the successful bidder for the construction
of light draught composite gunboats Nos.
14 and 15 of the United States navy.- The
contract cost is $223,000 and $219,000, re
spectively. They are to be completed
within fifteen months. ;-'â '
A few days ago Senior Lieutenant Capps, ,
U. S. N., arrived from Washington, and is
now on duty at the Union Iron Works.
He will superintend the hull construction
of the new craft. .
Active work in the building of the boats
will begin soon, and it is expected that the
construction of the vessels will enable the
contractors to enlarge the - force -of work
men. .X. : 7 '.â¢â¢-.'"â â â¢*â 
The new gunboats are of a type wholly
different from the Bennington and Con
cord. The exterior design of gunboat 15 â
and .14 is " exactly . the same is shown in
the illustration accompanying. The naval
architecture 'of the . craft is greatly ad
mired, and surely service aboard 7 one of
these light-draught ; steamers will be de
sired by reason of the comforts offered.
Tho gunboats are j not designed for de
stroyers of commerce, but they are
equipped nevertheless to fight, and will
attain a speed of twelve knots an hour.
For navigation 7of rivers, bays and;
estuaries where the water is shallow they
will render the best service, as they will be
able to ascend streams where cruisers and
battle-ships would not dare venture., Boats
of this description will prove exceptionally
useful in Asiatic waters. By the terms of
the XX recent treaty between Japan and
China many of the Chinese rivers will be
open to the commerce of the world. Boats
drawing only twelve " feet of waterâ the
draught of Nos. 14r and 15â can navigate
these rivers a long distance from the sea.
Therefore,- in the event of insurrection or
tumult inland, requiring the presence of
United States forces to protect American
citizens, the gunboats ; could land troops
near the scene of disturbance, while the
cruisers would be compelled to remain at
a distance of ( 100 miles or more from tne
danger point. ; .
Each of the new gunboats is to carry six
four-inch rapid-fire guns. There is one
gun forward and one aft on the main deck
and two on either broadside of the gun
deck. There are also four six-pounders
and four one-pounders. With the rat>id
fire four-inch guns some effective work in
open fighting against other craft could be
done, while the six-pounders might make
things lively for bodies of troops on the
shore. For their size, Nos. 14 and 15 of the
United: States navy should be splendid
fighters. In point of maintenance they
should not be expensive. The consump
tion of coal ought not to be great, as each
boat has sail area of 4000 feet. A Frank
lin life preserver is part of the equipment.
The principal dimensions and general
features are . # .
' Length on load water line, 174 feet; beam
extreme at load water line, 34 feet; draught
normal to bottom ot wooden keel, 12 feet; dis
â¢ placement, 1000 tons ; indicated horsepower,
800: speed estimated, 12 knots; coal supply
bunker capacity, 250 tons; complement of offi
cers, seamen and marines, 146.
- : The rapid accumulation of marine vege
tation and barnacles on the bottoms of
steel-plated warships, the reduction of
speed, increased consumption of coal, the
great? expense of fi semi-annual y docking
have troubled the Navy Department ever
since the ; new, navy, began. In the com
posite vesselâ a mixed structure of % wood
and metal, with its bottom of planking
coppered without, or, where the greater
strength required it, plated first with steel
as above water, then sheathed with wood,
also coppered; and the '. whole so fastened
to the metal frames- and plating by com
position bolts that galvanic action should
be averted, , a system long urged by Chief
Constructor Hichborn, is j found a means
of - avoiding y these V' evils, while 7 adding
greatly to the efficiency of the craft at all
times. : - ...... . 'â :â¢:.â  ' ' r 'â '-. ...-..â

there are people in the county, the price
being 3 cents each, 2 cents additional being
asked in the form of a subscription for the
general work of the committee, including
the mailing of the maps. He said that the
committee occupied a unique position in
that it is the first effort of the kind for the
advancement of the interests of the entire
State. Heretofore some 7of the sections
have worked together, but usually to the
detriment of -others. - Now all sections are
co-operating. Chairman Bunker said: y 7
Wehave the largest and most representative
committee that has ever been formed in the
State, probably in any State, for that, purpose.
There is no political bias, no one has an ax to
grind, and no member of : the committee re
ceives any compensation, - directly or indi
rectly. San Francisco is more directly inter
ested in the work of the general committee
than any other section, in that it has more
money invested all over the State and
more money loaned on / country prop
erty than any . other county. . Oakland,
representing Alameda County, is in the
vanguard of this - movement. The Mer
chants' Exchange has taken up the matter en
thusiastically. They called a meeting two

tion of A. P. A. Objects as
Officially Set Forth.
MEMBERSHIP OF THE ORDER.
A Series of Questions Are Again Pre
sented to Father Yorke and His
Answer Asked For.
The following is an answer by Rev.
f Father P. C. Yorke to the synopsis of a
'lecture recently delivered by Dr. J. L.
_orK:
February 11,1896.
' To the Editor of The. Callâ Dear Sib: I see
'. in your issue of Monday the synopsis of a lee
! ture by Dr. .1. L. York In reply to my argument
'â¢ on "Infallibility'" delivered before the J_duca
. tional Union. That argument presupposed
' the existence of a God and the existence of a
< revelation from God. to man. Naturally Dr.
: York objects to these suppositions and devotes
I his lecture to a description of the divine and
of revelation.
In his survey of the universe the learned j
lecturer discovers certain things which be con
eiders divine. These are matter, force and
I natural law. To these he applies the incom- i
municable attributes eternal and infinite. Let !
us consider how far he is justified in this pro
ceeding, and first let us take the question of
" 1. Matter.
The doctor evidently considers that matter
is something different from force, something
in which force inheres, as, for instance, heat in
iron, or, more roughly, water in a sponge.
But what evidence has he that there Is such a
thing as matter apart irom force? He has
never seen matter, never touched matter,
never came in direct contact witn matter in
any shape or form, and yet we find him,
agnostic though he be, making a public act of
faith in something which his eyes have
not seen nor his ears heard nor his hands
, handled.
' Let us see how this accusation is justified.
i We "come into relations with things outside of
ourselves through the senses. These senses
â¢ are all modifications of touch. From all por
j tions of our body are minute threads running
jto the brain. These threads are telegraph
i wires and the brain is the central office.
; When an excitement is set up by any of these
' threads a message is hashed along the nerves
. to the brain, where its significance is inter
preted by our consciousness.
Special kinds of messages are received by
. specially developed organs. The eye receives
the messages which we- commonly call light,
â  the ear receives sound; the palate taste, the
nostrils odor. These specialized organs we call
sense and their office is to receive messages
â¢ from the world which is outside our conscious
ness.
Â» Now we see at once that there Is no sense
which brings us in direct contact with what
we call matter, or that in which force resides.
All the messages which come. to us are the re
sults of forces. When I put my hand on a
table the only message which my conscious
ness receives is that there is some "for. which
resists the force exerted by my hand. That
force I find occupies a definite area and acts in
certain definite ways. It the element of light
is introduced I discover that certain other mes
sages are telegraphed throueh the optic nerve,
hut these messages, .too, are the" results of
forces. ._ with the remaining senses, their
activity is stimulated only by forces and only
by force are we brought into relations with ]
things which are outside of ourselves.
We speak, it is true, of chairs, tables, houses, â 
mountains, streams, meadows, but all these
names are only labels put upon certain deter
minate sets of forces which produce certain
determinate messages on the telegraph wires
which lead to the central office, where con
sciousness receives and interpret- them.
A peculiar character of this consciousness of
ours is that it is always asking questions. It
is not satisfied with receiving messages; it
marks each of them with a big interrogation
nif.rk. Indeed our intellect is only an
animated why, as the poet knew who put hap
piness in its answer.
Felix gui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.
Hence it is continually asking what is the
cause of these impressions/ sensations or mes
sages which come tb us from the outside. - The
first thing it settles is that there is something
outside of us. There exists something which
is not I. It is the thin?- (whatever we may call
it) which starts â â â¢ these messages along the
nerves to the brain. â - â¢-â 
But what is this something? Let us call it
force. Now, force means. nothing more than
the. exciting agent of these sensations. It is
power or act in its most tenuous form. We
find, however, that this force or power is mani
fested in certain well-defined ways. Thus for
instance it can be localized. A certain set of
forces can-be stationed, so to speak, in a dis
tinct area. When we *peak of a stone -or a
lump of coal or. a piece of gold we merely mean
that certain bundles of things which cause
sensations or messages to our brain have been
imprisoned in certain forms, in certain shapes,
in certain locations. We can deal with the
forces thus imprisoned; we can transport them
from place to place; we can generally dissipate
them.
Hence the mind asks the question, How is It
that force may be so localized, may be so im
prisoned? A common answer supposes what
is called matter, or another something in
â which force rests and' which gives it, so to
speak, a local habitation and a name. The
essential idea of this something called matter
is its localization, its limitation. It puts
limits to the wanderings of force. It is the
vessel which contains water; it is the cord
which ties the bundle of sticks.
Hence it will be readily seen how unscien
| tific it is for Dr. York to say that matter is di
: vine because it is everlasting and universal.
Matter is only an hypothesis to explain the be
havior of certain forces. Some people do away
â¢with the idea altogether a* unnecessary, But,
supposing the hypothesis is necessary, and that
there is a something different from force in
which force resides, it is puerile to say that it
.is universal or infinite. The very idea of mat
ter is the antithesis of universality. It is
something which, can be cut in chunks and
.some of it put here and some of it put there. Its
I essential attribute is limitation, and anything
which is limited cannot be universal. A thing
; is necessarily universal when by its very nature
it must be diffused everywhere; but matter,
which is only a synonym for limits, Is not ne
cessarily, universal. On the contrary, it is ne
cessarily definedâ circumscribedâ for the only
.possible use of it is to limit, define or c_cum
ecribe force.
Again, the idea of matter is opposed to the
idea of everlasting. It Is only a function of
force, and we cannot deal with it as ever
lasting apart irom force. When Dr. York says
that matter cannot be destroyed he. is con
foundlnt matter with energy or force. Indeed,
there is nothing so easily destructible as
matter. , In .reality.it is but a more or less
etabie balance of forces, and that balance is
upsetting every minute and hour of the day
and night. The matter which we call a lump
of coal can be destroyed in a few seconds.* The
forces inherent in the matter are not de
stroyed, but are released to form other com
binations, but the matter itself is done for.
finished, and anything which can be done for
or finished is not everlasting nor yet divine
2. Natural Law.
One peculiarity we remark about these forces,
which set up sensations in us, is that their ac
tion is constant and uniform. If a man sits
down on a red-hot stove, the nerves always
carry a remarkably well-defined series of mes
sages to the central office. So in the relations of
forces one to another, we find that they are
combined or resolved in certain definite ways
A description of these combinations or these
resolutions we call natural law. We -'say that
natural, law is ; constant, and â¢ unchangeable
meaning thereby that forces always act in the
same manner under, the same conditions and
that the only way to alter â¢ their action is to al
ter the relations of the forces.
Now, as the doctor: well remarks, natural
. law, in this sense, is not the cause why the
forces so behave. i It is merely a description of
their behavior. .To say,* therefore, that natural
law is divine or - eternal is as reasonable as to
predicate divinity of the description of a doe
fight. ' ... â  .â â *.'..,-â¢ -*-
If -natural law meant - the cause or . reason
why .forces so acted; there might ,be some
reason for deoking it 'with complimentary ad
jectives. ..But science is superstitiously care
ful to excise the idea of causation. When it is
laid down as a law that a stone when unsup
ported falls to tbe earth; no cause is assigned
*
for the phenomenon. If it be said as it is some
times said that the stone falls because of the
law; of, gravitation, this when "interpreted
means that it falls because it falls.
Hence when the doctor was looking abroad
for the divine and pitched upon the natural
law, he made a poor choice. â¢ He might as well
have taken the . rules of syntax o r the multi
plication tables and set them up as divinities.
3. Force. .* 7- Â7 y --â  . , 7
There remains then only force to which the
doctor may apply the term divine. ... Now when
we consider the" forces with which we come in
contact we learn that each is the resultant of
other forces. The main business of natural
science is to resolve the composite forces which
we denominate phenomena into other forces.
Each force. which sends its message to our
brain is the result of a long series of forces
which stretches away beyond our ken. One
force succeeds to another like the links of a
chain;
The intellect, therefore, comes to this series
of forces with its eternal why? The question
is put, Whence came the first of those forces,
the original impulse? It does not do to say
that the chain is. eternal or infinite. Even
though the primal energy be one and the same
under all forms, still these forms sweep over it
in a succession of waves. Succession implies
numeration and- numeration contradicts
infinity.
Each force is caused by a combination of
other forces. We can number these combina
tions one, two, three. We may go back as far
as we please, passing the million point, the
billion point, the trillion ; point, but we can
never pass a point where numbers cease to be
available, and wherever numbers are available
is within the region of the limited, the finite.
If a chain should hang down out of the sky
and men should climb up a thou
sand links or two thousand or three
they would not have answered the question
from what does the chain hang by saying that
beyond the last link they reached there were
still links unnumbered. We must, if we do
justice to our reason, assume the existence of
some point of support, just as, if we do justice
to our reason, we must suppose the existence of
some > force, which is uncaused by any other
force and from which all other forces proceed.
4. GOD.
This first force must be at least the dynamic
equivalent of aU existing, sensible forces, be
cause the greater cannot proceed from the less.
Every pound of force expended by the wheels'
of the clock must be contained in the main
spring. *
.' Now, this sensible force cannot be infinite or
divine, as Dr. York would have it. Because, if
it is infinite, then it is equaled by the first
force and we have two infinites, which is as
absurd as the claim made by your contempo- :
raries that each has the largest circulation.;
There cannot be two infinities, and therefore
sensible or physical 'force must be finite. f_
â¢ Is. the first or uncaused force finite? Has
that force which is not caused by any other
force, but exists of itself, any limits? - In the
very beginning, as this force is unproduced. it
cannot be limited by a producing force. The
force exerted by a steam engine is limited by
the power Â«>f the engine,, the fuel, in a word
the productive agencies. But the first force
being unproduced by anything cannot be lim
ited by anything. Again", as it is a force which
exists by its own nature there is nothing in
that nature which, would imply limitation.
Only force can limit force, and that force
which is first, supreme and alone, cannot be
limited by any other. Hence the very idea of
an uncaused, self-existing force implicates the
idea that such force is infinite, and therefore
God.
It is evident at once that this self-existent
force is not to be confounded with the forces
which he created, which he set in motion.
Being infinite force he must be infinite' will,
infinite knowledge, infinite .power. In a word,
he is God as the reason of man has discovered
him from the beginning through the works of
his hands and the heavens which show forth
his glory. Yours truly, P. C. Yorke.
A. P. A. PRINCIPLES.
Another Communication From the
State President.,
The following is a copy of a letter ad
dressed by B. F. Hudelson, State presi
dent of the A. P. A., to Rev. Father
Yorke :
Office of the State Council of California,
Room 40, Academy of Science Building, I
819 Market street. f
San Francisco, Cal., February 11, 189(>.J
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sir: Having
.onchided my statement of the principles of
the American Ptotective Association by the
presentation of its objects mid its platform
and its political principles, 1 herewith pass to
the consideration of the "A. P. A. Interpreta
tion of A. 1". A. Principles." This letter deals
with the interpretation of the "Objects of the
A. P. A." as officially set forth by the supreme
authority of. the order. These objects will be
found below in quoted paragraphs, the inter
pretation of each section following immedi-
I ately the paragraph to which it refers:
INTERPRETATION OF A. P. A. OBJECTS. I
1. "The American Protective Association is
1 organized for the purpose of purifying politics; Is
. a non-sectarian and a non-partisan organization
i composed only of true American citizens, without
regard to nationality."
"Purifying politics" means the elimination from
the councils of the Nation, Suite and municipality
of every element of corruption and incompetency,
and the securing to the majority of American citi
zens, without manipulation, a" free and honest
recognition of their wish in respect to the adminis
tration of the several departments of tiovernment.
It does not mean turning out one set of rascals to
install another.
2. "While we unite to protect our country and
its institutions, we attack no man's religion so long
as he does not attempt to make it an element In
political power."
We hold that "any religion attempts to become a
factor in political power" when Its church by or
ganized representatives attempts to control or
sway the vote of Its communicants, or to dictate
legislation, or to name appointees for public oflice.
3. "Our aim is to preserve and maintain the
Government of the United States and the princi
ples of the Declaration of Independence as set
forth by the founders against the encroachments
of all foreign Influence. "
f We hold that the "preserviiion and maintenance
of the C'overument of Hie United States and the
principles of the Declaration of Independence asset
forth by the founders" involves the permanence
of a representative government, as now constitu
ted, and the upholding of the spirit and the letter
of the "palladium of a merican liberty." i The "en
croachment of all foreign Influence" means what it
saysâ foreign Influence, whether found under polit
ical, military or ecclesiastical garb. â¢
4. "We regard all rellgio-polltical organizations
as the enemies of civil and religious liberties." .
We â¢ hold that "rellgio-polltical organizations"
are organizations formed wholly or- in part for po
litical purposes, yet which require that a man to
be eligible to membership therein must be a com
municant of some particular church.
_Â». "It is, in our opinion, unsafe and unwise to
appoint or elect to civil or military offices in this
countrymen who owe supreme allegiance to any
foreign king, potentate 'or ecclesiastical power, or
who are sworn to obey such power."
We hold that "men owe supreme allegiance to
any foreign king., potentate or ecclesiasttcal
power" who, in case of conflict on whatsoever
point between the United States Government and
said king, potentate or ecclesiastical power, would
I be constrained to uphold such power ln preference
to our National (lovernment. ,
6. "We are in favor of maintaining one general,
unsectarian public school system, and will oppose
all attempts to supplant it by any sectarian insti
tution. We are opposed to the use of public funds
for any sectarian purpose."
The "maintenance of the unsectarian free pnbl'c
school system" Includes the non-diversion- of its
revenue for any purpose whatever. "All attempts
to supplant it by any .sectarian Institution" in
cludes any organized purpose on the part of mem
bers of any : sect, to withdraw or withhold their
children from the public schools. "- The ."use of
public funds for any sectarian, purpose". Includes
the payment of public moneys to institutions con
trolled -by any sect or | church upon any â  pretext
whatever. " i fiHWMiillllm ii ly ._â Â»â  ......
7. "We are in favor of changing our Immigration
laws in such a manner that they â¢ will protect our
citizen laborers from the influences of pauper and
criminal labor, which, through the Instrumentality
of Kuropean propagandist societies, are rapidly
supplanting our free and educated American citi
zens in every line of Industry; but we do not | op
pose honest and educated immigrants who come
for the purpose of becoming American citizens and
who will forswear allegiance to all foreign poten
tates ana powers."
.-â â  This section means simply the close restriction
of immigration, admitting only those who come
with the intelligent purpose of becoming American
citizens, and who will forswear allegiance to every
foreign power, whether military, civil or ecclesias
tical. >
8. "We are in favor of putting into office honest
and true . patriots, who are qualified and who owe
allegiance only to the Stars and Stripes."
We hold that men "who are qualified" for office
are men who by character, education and ability
are fitted to fill the particular offices to which they
may have aspired. We hold that "allegiance to
the Stars, and Stripes" is exclusive, and forbids al
legiance to any foreign potentate or power what
soever. .
Mr. Editor: This concludes mv interpreta
tion of the "Objects of the A. P. A." in proper
course I shall hand you my official Interpreta
tion of our platform and . our political prin
ciples. In the meantime permit me, Mr.
Editor,? to repeat for - the : last time in you.

The Engraving Took Two Years.
Representative White of Illinois wears
on his little finger of the left hand a seal
ring whose historic interest far surpasses
the intrinsic value of the jewel, although
it is probably the finest intaglio in Wash
ington, it is a plain, unostentatious hya
cinth, bearing the classic head of Antonius
Pius, ruler of Rome from 138 to 161" and
was cut and worn by the great Roman
philosopher and emperor 1700 years ago.
Mr. White secured it during his sojourn in
Italy, paying 1 3000 francs for it, or about
$000 in American money. It had a Roman
setting of great antiquity. Mr. . White
took the ring to Tiffany's, in Paris, and
ordered the stone to be set in a plain cold
band. The great jewelery firm specified
that it would do so only at the owner's
risk, on account of the incalculable value
of the stone. The head is engraved in a
pure hyacinth, which, whon held to the
light, is perfectly translucent and gives
out a remarkable play of colors. The en
graving is perfect, and leading lapidaries
have assured Mr. White that it required
two years to complete the head in- its per
fected details.â Washington Post.

SENT AWAY NOSES APART
The Australian Starting Machine
Proved a Revelation to
Race-Goers.
WAS CHEERED TO THE ECHO.
Favorites Took but Two Races at In
gleside â Sir Vassar Won at â  Xy-
Lengthy Odds.
The Gray Australian starting â â  machine
was given a trial at Ingleside track yester
day; Many tales have been ; wafted; over
the seas from the land of the Southern
Cross of j* gigantic fields of Antipodean
racers being sent away in ' big stake races
heads on the starting post in incredibly
short periods of time, but new innovations
in racing are hard to introduce, and after
its earnest advocate, F. de B. Lopez, the
Australian turfman, had almost despaired
of ever being given an opportunity to
demonstrate its efficacy, it remained 'for
the Pacific Coast Jockey Club to give the
invention a trial that is destined to revolu
tionize starting in this country.
That the public might be.the judge, the
machine was set up in front of the grand
stand. In . construction it is simplicity
personified. ' L>?" : . ,"â '*"'/ X- *â¢_>... ; <.' . â /.'.
. Two strong bands of webbing stretching
across the . track are attached to a frame
that by means of strong elastic bands
slides upward and away on 7 iron rods,
placed at an angle of 'â¢ 45 degrees, at the
touch of a lever.
The experimental trial occurred in the
mile hurdle race with ten starters, and all
sorts of predictions were made as to what
that notoriously bad actor, Bellringer,
would do with, the strands of webbing.
The race was a good betting affair, Three
Forks going to the post a 2% to 1 choice:
St. Brandon, who opened at G to 5, reced
ing to sixes. When the horses were called
out Mr. Lopez took his place on a tempo
rarily constructed stand opposite the grand
stand. ...
It was a trying ordeal, for the trial
meant success" or relegation to the junk
store forever. , From the outset the horses
took kindly to it, and before one minute
had elapsed the operator pulled down the
lever. The webbing instantly shot up
ward and the horses went away to one of
the prettiest starts ever seen on a' race
course. "Neglectful of the field of "lep
pers," the grand-stand arose en masse and
cheered. Not detracting from Mr. Cald
well's starting, which has been uniformly
excellent throughout the meeting, it must
be said that this mechanical contrivance is
a revelation and that the time is near
when human patience and skill- must give
way to the inventor's art. So it has been
in other trades and professions and why
not on the turf? . . .'â â /
The race developed a surprise, for after
leading up to the last jump, Three Forks
made a mistake and threw Allmark heav
ily. 7 St. Brandon then won easily from
Barman.
The day's sport was most enjoyable.
The weather was summery and the at
tendance large. Favorites" captured two
events, the others going to outsiders.
For the opening six-furlong race, Kam
sin and Gratify went to the post equal
choices, 2 to 1 being obtained against
either. After Levena C had made all the
running, Kamsin passed her in the stretch
and in a mild drive beat the mare out a
neck. Olive was an ordinary third. Gratify
was away from the post poorly.
The four-furlong race for two-year-olds,
j with seven starters, . was a mere cake-walk
\ for the 2 to 5 ; favorite Zamar, who won
bands down from Ingleside. Lord Ches
terfield finished in tbe show. The winner
covered the distance in :50>_.
The third event, over seven furlongs, re
sulted in a hollow victory for Tom Grif
fin's colt Sir Vassar, on which Lamley
beat the flag, and, never headed, won
easily from Scimitar, the 11 to 5 favorite.
The "start-was a: bad one, imp. Fulierton
Lass, Daylight and Ida Saver being left at
the post. - â¢ X < : 'â 'Â;';,' , -
The last race was also a seven-furlong
affair. Our Maggie was made an 8 to 5
favorite, with Tenacity a strong second
choice. Barney Schreiber's gelding Ferris
Hartman, a 10 to 1 shot, led from the jump
and won Handily, with Fortuna second in
a drive with Tenacity.
Track and Paddock Items.
The well-known bookmaker and owner
of racegoers, Charles Durkee, passed away
in the city Los Angeles on Monday of
the present week. '7 -'."j^
Leonville pulled up slightly lame after
his race,
Tom Griffin had Sir Vassar in to be sold
for $500. When put up to be auctioned,
Leo Mayer, the Chicago bookmaker, bid
him up to $1200, his owner retaining him
with the usual $5 bid. It is said the origin
of Uie "boost" dates back to a couple" , of
years "i ago, when . a brother .of 7 Griffin's
claimed a horse owned by Mayer out of 'a
selling iy race ; that was sporting in Pat
Dunne's colors. : â â '.â 'â .â - " -\l
51 Macklin pulled Hazard up as the flag
fell on the field in the last race and was left
at the post: 7 ' /./;/ â '/"â â  . "./ f-Xr : X'-'/X '
'-. account of the peculiar in and out
form shown by. Levena C in her races the
stewards decided ; yesterday to refuse her
entry in future at Ingleside track. :
Starter Ferguson claimed that Tod Sloan,
astride of Fulierton Lass in the 7 third
race, pulled up, which caused him as well
as Daylight and Ida Saver being left at the
post. -Sloan was suspended for the meet
ing. .-;'.â ';
Bellringer was worked on at the conclu
sion- of the hurdle event, and owner Frank
Taylor was fined $25 for not first obtaining
permission from the judges.
_ A. 7 B. Spreckels,: president of the new
Jockey Club, stated last evening to some
friends that he was more than sorry that
important business kept him from visiting
the /track yesterday and witnessing the
trial of the starting machine. The wealthy
turfman has always been an advocate of
the machine and has been in correspond-;
ence 7 with different Australian racing
officials in regard to the merits of the in
vention. It was through, the instrumen
tality of the president that the machine
was first setup on the backstretch and he
was delighted to learn of its success.
The general opinion of horsemen was
favorable to the mechanical starter. "Jim"
Ferguson',' starter " at the "Bay," said
"there's no doubt about it being a success,",
but wondered how the two-year-olds would
take to it. Mr. Caldwell also admitted its
efficacy, but wanted to see it tried on * the
younger division. In his dry way Marty
Bergen remarKed: "If that thing had
come out ten years ago I'd been a million
aire now." It is claimed for Marty that
he has paid more fines than any boy on
the . turf. Sam Doggett said it was the
best thing he ever saw in the starting line,
and predicted a great success for the
machine. "Stony" Clarke wanted to see
it tried; first. . Previous to the race he
said he" could just imagine old Bell
ringer chasing around the track encircled
by about forty yards of webbing.
LADIES' DAT AT INGLESIDE.
An Unusually Fine Programme Prepared for
the Edification of Fair Race-Goers.
Following the usual custom at the Ingle-,
side track the gate will be free to the fair
sex to-day. An unusually fine programme
of six events has been prepared* Among
the many starters will be game old Logan;
the seasoned campaigner, who would
rather be out on the track racing than
standing in his stall. â  "X- .;/,
'Two of the events on the card are over
a mile, and both starts will be made with
the Australian startine-machine. ' -
Extra cars will be run for the accommo
dation of ladies and the management pre
dict the largest crowd of the meeting.
Pools will be sold on all the fights at El
Paso by George Rose at 25 Ellis street.
AMONG THE WHEELMEN.
Good Roads Meeting To-Morrow Even
ing- Acme Wheelmen's '*
. Election.
The good roads meeting to be held to
morrow evening, at the rooms of the Bay
City Wheelmen, 441 Golden Gate avenue,
promises to be well attended. . Delegates
will be present from all ftie bicycle clubs,
draymen and teamsters' unions, the dairy
men's association, the carriage companies,
and every organization which could possi
bly have an interest in the securing of good
streets and roads in San Francisco County.
Arrangements will be made for a .big
public demonstration upon the occasion
of the visit of the State Bureau of High
ways to this county next month. A great
deal of enthusiasm i<" being manifested in
the " good , roads work by the ,'. League of
American Wheelmen, to whom it 7 has
seemingly been left by general consent,
and it is surely in good hands.
The racing men are training actively
now. Those" who have aspirations for
track honors are not doing as hard work
as the road-racers, for the next track meet
does not occur until the indoor tourna
ment in March. A week from next Satur
day, however, is the Associated Clubs'
twenty-five mile ro'adrace, and it is for
some of the valuable prizes in this event
that the men are exerting themselves now
so as to be in proper shape. Twenty-five
miles is a long distance to ride at top
speed and it requires a great deal of pre
paratory work to enable a rider to main
tain the pace required for such a long
distance. â¢ V
â¢ The wheelmen watch the arrival of the
NEW TO-DAT.
WHATIT COSTS~~~
to get health
To a Sufferer From Nervous Debility.
If you go through a course of medicine with a prominent
physician or specialist, you will spend from $50 to $250, taking
nasty medicines every day for a year, and then, ask those, who
have tried it, and they will tell you the cure is not certain.
If you saturate your nervous system every night with Elec-
tricity from Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt the cost is from $5 to $30,
depending on your condition, and ask those who have tried it if
the cure is not certain. Thousands have testified to it. â  , â  . X
Your cure by this method never takes more than two or
three months. \
Then no poisonous drugs are swallowed. No ruined stom-
ach. No time wasted. No inconvenience. â¢

KEENE PLAYS LOUIS XI
Warm Reception Given the
Favorite Actor at the
California.
"â¢;-VW* : y; ; .7 -'â :' ~y -
An Artistic Impersonation of the
French Kingâ Miss Belgarde's
Marie.
Thomas Keene was welcomed back to
San Francisco last night by a large and
appreciative audience, which almost filled
the California Theater. , Hearty applause
was given the actor on his first appearance
and at the end of the third act a deter
mined effort was made to induce him to .
break forth into a speech, but, Mr. Keene
modestly refused to comply . . '- â â ' ' "Xx 7.1
The play was Louis XI." It was
played by the supporting company in a
way that seldom rose above mediocrity,
but Keene, himself, in the title role more
than atoned for the somewhat monotonous
character of his support.
" I am France," says Louis XI, and
the actor who played the title-role last
night might have paraphrased these lines
and said: " lam the play.''
There are few living actors who- can
play the crafty, hypocritical French King
as Keene can. Two of the greatest are
Irving and Novell. The former is only
known slightly in San Francisco, the
latter not at all, and were these ac
tors' interpretations* familiar * here the
Louis XI tliat Keene presented last night
could well challenge comparison with
them. _ Â.'.;
Keene's was a senile Louis 'Xl,' even
from the first act, but he always conveyed
skillfully to ", his hearers i through the
senility the cunning of the crafty, un
scrupulous old diplomat. There was a
touch of ermines., in the laughter that
Louis' apish religious unties aroused. In
the scene in the kings- bedchamber, the
magnificent intensity of Keene's acting,
which was free from all tinge ofstaginess,
sent a genuine thrill of horror through his
hearers. All" through the play his char
acterization of . the king was even consist
ent and artistic to the minutest detail. 7
*' The same praise cannot be lavished upon
the supporting company. For the most
part they were neither strikingly good nor
remarkably bad. â â * Mr. Eagleson was sin
cere 3nd j dignified as Jaques_Coitier, and
the same ; may be said in an "even higher
degree of Mr. Carleton as the Bieur de
Com mines. Mr. Lowell .was a passable
Dauphin, and Mr. Hennig as the Due de
isemours showed better intentions than
execution in his acting.
Miss Adele Belgarde is well known to
San Francisco audiences, but her imper
sonation of Marie of Commines showed
an advance on her previous work, thougn
she still has too much tendency to be
spasmodic. The peasants were well rep
resented and the minor characters in the
cast were not unsatisfactorily sustained,
but beside the splendidly artistic work of
the star effulgence of his satilites appeared
pale. - . , ,

A Successor to the Historic Pile
to Occupy the Ancient
Site.
ROMANESQUE SEEMS POPULAR.
Mr. Mooser Seems Not to Like - the
Idea of his Plans Being Pawed :
Over by Rivals.
.Some. fine specimens of pen and ink
drawing, elegantly framed, ; made the
committee* toom of the Board of Super
visors look like an architectural artroom
yesterday. The Municipal Building Com
mittee of the board held a special session
In the forenoon for the purpose of viewing
plans and elevations for the edifice which
is to occupy the site of the old City Hall.
The sixteen competitors all made a very
creditable showing, some of i the designs

submitted being elegant examples of archi- |
ifectural skill, while ,the draughting was
particularly deserving of notice.
A stately edifice in the perpendicular
Romanesque style, with a massive square
tower in the center of the facade and tur
rets similar in design at the corners, is one
of the ideals evolved by Messrs. Kraft,
Martens & Coffey, who also exhibited a
perspective r in pen and ink of a second
building of the Roman order with five
domes, which was much admired. -
W. O. Banks also submitted two de
signs, one of which was somewhat severe
in outline, and the other a majestic speci
men of the Norman Gothic type.
The combined Roman and lonic found an
able advocate in William Mooser, who dis
played a design which, though plain, is
classical and imposing.
Another handsome perspective was
handed in by Shea & Shea. Their idea is
a building whose lines are purely Roman,
though the treatment of the upper portion
and the roof, with its tall central tower
and four large domes, suggests the Byzan
tine. Frank Shea was present at the
meeting and entertained the board for up
ward of an hoÂ»r with a detailed descrip
tion of the firm's projected structure. In
the matter of internal arrangement Mr.
Shea submitted two plans, warmly, advo
cating the first as against the second. In
the first plan the City: Prison, instead of
occupying the basement, as recommended
by the board, would be placed on the fifth
floor, entirely isolated from every other
department of the building, but having
the advantage of air and sunlight. Ac
cording to this plan the prisoners would
have a dining-room and no food would be
permitted to enter the cells. An elevator,
closely barred, would transfer the prison
ers to and from the various courtrooms.
Mr. Shea strongly opposed the Police
Department using the upper floor for a
drillroom. He contended that the vibra
tion caused by a large body of men march
ing in time with each other would eventu
ally work serious injury to the building.
Hence he recommended that the drilling
room and officers' quarters be located in
the basement. In the second plan the
prison was located in the basement accord
ing to the requirement of the board, and

in both plans arrangement was made for
the complete separation of the various
grades of prisoners. .
An exceedingly graceful and elegant
design was presented by W. M. Curie tt.
It represents a lofty structure in the
quaint Flemish style, with high-pitched
roofs and fancifully adorned gables/ Mr.
Curlett in a few words called the board's
attention to some special features in his
plan, one of which was a driveway into

side, by means of which patients could be
conveyed to the Receiving Hospital' with
out even a momentary exposure "to the
weather. '.77:j*^i*)*$l__W*"' ' â  ,7^^SB|
This covered driveway, Mr. Curlett said,
THE : SAN ; FRANCISCO â  CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1896.
had another advantage, since it permitted
the occupation of . the present open pas
sage-way to the Morgue and would allow
communication â¢ between â both buildings
without rendering it necessary to go out
of doors.
In the Receiving Hospital Mr. Curlett's
plan calls for plenty of sun and air. He
would have the patients enter through the
arched driveway to the reception-rooms in
the basement, where they would receive
the immediate treatment which : their
cases might require, after which they
would be conveyed to the floor above in
an. elevator of sufficient size to admit, a
couch with its bearers. , y *
On this floor, the first, strictly speaking,
would be the hospital proper, having a
separate ward for women, with accommo
dation v for a matron . and female attend
ants, a dining-room for convalescents, and
a spacious kitchen, besides three com
modious wards for male patients.
Light would be supplied to the interior
of the building through a central court
yard of sufficient area to admit the sun
light into each side during some portion
of the day. Each floor of. tbe building
would have, toward the Kearny-street
front, a spacious square hall upon which
the entrances to the various departments
would open. Besides the elevator for the
exclusive use of the Receiving . Hospital
Mr. Curlett would have three others two
for public use and one in a retired 7 part
of the building for the transportation of
prisoners and their custodians to and from
the courts and prison.
" Charles M. Rousseau stood sponsor to
another plan representing a Romanesque
construction with a high tower. He ex
plained some advantages which he claimed
for his proposal, notably the floors. : He
objected to Mr. Shea's statement that
drilling on the upper floors would cau?e a
vibration injurious to the building.
. "I would make floors that no amount of
marching would shake," he said. "First
I would lay a substratum of stout iron
girders not too far apart. Then from
girder to girder I would extend longitudi
nal vaults of concrete. The upper surface
of these vault'! would be tilled in with the
concrete, ' leveled ; smooth, â and
above this could be laid a \ paving of flags
or tiles; or else the floors could be finished
in Portland cement, or covered with wood,
for that matter. I should like to know,"
he concluded,, "what vibration there could
ba with a floor like . that. Xlt would be im
pervious to sound, and just as firm as the
solid bedrock. .1, may not' know every
thing,' but _ an* not afraid to say I know
bow to make a floor."
A fine specimen also in Romanesque
with an occasional Tudor effect 7 was 7 sub
mitted by :; : Havens & Toepko. 'i. A.
singularly beautiful effect is given this de
sign by a central tower,.' of y open stone
work, in which lightness and strength are
charmingly combined. 7

Mrs. Cooper declined to discuss Mrs.
Harland's statement yesterday, except to
refer to the resolution unanimously passed
by ; the amendment committee. Mrs.
Elizabeth Sargent, State president of the
association, replying to the . inquiry, "Did
Mrs., Cooper persecute ; Mrs. Harland?"
said:' ';"â â ' ; , ;"â ', ;' TtTA 'â ' X'"X/:X
'.'Mrs. Cooper is a woman* of high char
acter and integrity." "There; is no truth in
the. statement that. she persecuted; Mrs.
Harland. For business reasons, which do
not concern the public, Mrs. Harland re
signed " from her position as manager for
the association.
"I regret very much," continued Mrs.
Sargent, "that the association should be
brought into any connection with , the
Brown scandal."
Mrs. Brown is opposed to giving anony
mous correspondence or even signed let
ters bearing on the case to the public,* but
under the circumstances feels that she is
forced to. "I regret very much," she said
yesterday, ' "to publish such' correspond
ence, but Mrs. Cooper is making such an
effort to show that, public, sentiment is on
her side I feel it my duty to prove the con
trary. The letters here given are samples
of hundreds that have come to us, and are
given merely to show that my efforts to
defend my home are recognized as ray in
herent right." y The letters following, were
all signed, but the* names are withheld for
obvious reasons. The I first is from this
City, the writer assuring Mrs. Brown that
her course is ."fitting,, justifiable and

.Mrs. Dr. Brown: Kindly allow me to record
my approval, of. your stand. In regard to Mr.
Brown's troubles. It is fitting, justifiable and
courageous and in all rescecta proper thai you
should confront Mrs. Cooper in her course. Of
all ladles in - this State, outside even of the
Christian standpoint, she should be the last
to stir into the affairs of j a Christian family.

7 In' the next, letter addressed to Dr.
Brown the writer refers to Mrs. Cooper as
"a type of many in your church, who do
religion a deal of harm.";- It runs: ;
- Fresno, Cal., Feb. 9,1896."
Rev. Dr. C. 0. Brownâ Sir: Permit me, a
stranger to you, to say. a few words, which, if
they do no good, will do no harm. I believe in
your integrity. I believe you are a' true Chris
tian gentleman. I have carefully followed up
your case, and I candidly admit I 1 was very
much. prejudiced against you. * * * That
feeling has passed away, and I now say un
hesitatingly that Ido not . think you could do
a" wicked ; or disgraceful action. Regarding
that shining light of Christianity, Mrs. Cooper,,
let me here remark that she is a type of many
in your churches who do religion a deal of
harm. Give her rope enough and the tradi
tional event will occur. She pride*, herself
that she is at all times logical.
One glance at her logical thrufhfulness Is
enough. She hopes you are innocent, but can
prove your guilt. Without a doubt she has no
ill will or ill feeling against you or yours,
which she shows by both words and actions '
she Is hounding you to death In tho papers.
She says you can tell a tree by its fruits. I !
think the fruit in this tree's case is over-ripeâ
pluck such trees, root and branch, out of your
orchard, as their influence Is bad, contamin
ating. . *v * "-*_ I hope your friends will be true
to you in every way, and keep the Christian
friends of the Cooper type from killing you, for
the love of Christ. Hoping > for a speedy
triumph, An Old Soldier and Friend. 7
7 A gentleman writing from Oakland says
that Mrs. Cooper declared she ; would
"rather be in : bell with her cousin, Bob
Ingersoll, than in heaven with a certain
deacon of your church." The letter is as

There was consternation in - the down
town poolroom joints yesterday. Tbey
sprung a surprise on the Ingleside people,
and it proved a most; expensive one for
them. Making a round-up or the- bums,,
dissolute characters, "dope" "fiends | and
that ilk that patronize their dens, the pro
prietors picked out a crew and, each was
given a number. If the horse down on the
programme as No. 1 finished in front, why
bum No. 1 was to } parade^ in front jof the
grand stand, and confederates on a neigh
boring housetop would spot him by. means
of a telescopic tieldglass. .It so happened
that Kamsin, No. 10 on the programme,
captured the opening event, but bum No.
10 "ex-con" No. 6, who had probably
been getting rid of their daiiy allowance '
by imbibing at the bar, got their numbers
mixed up, and the man representing No.
6, which was Olive, sauntered out in front
of the stand, and very? speedily; Olive was
telephoned in the rooms as a winner.
The "commission joints" had laid 3 and
4 to 1 against the â¢ mare, and hundreds of
dollars* worth' of tickets are said to have
been cashed. One room alone, it is said,
paid out $800. As Kamsin won the race
they will also have to pay tickets with his
name on, or else resort to the old trick and
inform their poor dupes that the commis

BISHOP OF SACRAMENTO
Word Arrives From Rome by
Cable That He Has Been
- Appointed.
DOUBT AS TO THE CHOSEN MAN.
The "Primus Candidatus" Was Con
firmed, but Two Sets of Names
Were Forwarded.
It is reported that a Roman Catholic
bishop for Sacramento has been chosen.
This was made known yesterday by a
cablegram received by Rev. J. M. Conway
from Monsignor Pick, the domestic prelate'
at Rome representing * the German Bish
ops. Who the favored ecclesiastic is was
not definitely stated. The cable reads :
â¢ *. 7/; February 11, 1896.
â  Rev. Conway, San Francisco: Primus candi
datus heri electus.. Hodie confirmat. Pick. 7
: Tins-translated is: "The first candidate
was chosen yesterday. He was confirmed
to-day." *
The obscurity lies in the decision as to
who the "first 7 candidate" is. Father
Conway thinks that it is Father Grace of
Sacramento. He admits, however, that it
might mean Father McSweeney of the
Church of St. Francis de Sales in Oakland.
! X "Father Grace was , the first choice of
Bishop Manogue and also of the chapter
of the northern diocese," said Father Con
way yesterday. "Only a week before he
died the Bishop sent Father Grace's name
to the Holy Father with the request that
he be made his coadjutor. And upon the
Bishop's death there was ; not a dissenting
voice to the suggestion that Father Grace
be recommended to the vacant bishopric.
â j "As is usual three names were forwarded
to the College of the Propaganda. These
were Father Coleman of Marysville,
,'dignus.' or worthy; Father Lynch of
Grass Valley, 'dignior,' or more worthy,
and Father Grace, 'dignissimus,' or most'
worthy. Father Grace was looked upon
as the logical successor to the late Bishop
Manogue. He had been Bishop Man
ogue's right-hand man, and before his
death the Bishop had . expressed a wish
that Father Grace should succeed him.
You see, Father Grace has been pastor at
Sacramento for the past thirteen years,
and for eight years before that was in
Grass Valley. In this way he has become
thoroughly acquainted with the needs of
the diocese.
"The College of the Propaganda consider
the names forwarded. From these one is
chosen and sent to the Holy Father. If
he confirms the choice it stands. Other
wise a second choice is made. 7 If it were
deemed advisable a man not named by
the chapter or the Archbishop might be
chosen."
Father Conway's belief that his cable
told of the . appointment of Father Grace
arose from the fact that Monsignor Pick
knew of his interest in the Sacramento
priest. He therefore argues that ? the
"primus candidatus" would be the one he
was most anxious to see receive the honor.
SACRAMENTO CO DENT.
Citizens There Feel No Doubt That
â¢ the Appointment Has Fallen
. ..to Father. Grace.
â¢ SACRAMENTO, ? Cal., Feb. 11. â The
rumored appointment of the Rev. Thomas
Grace to the bishopric of this diocese has
created a wave of â , heartfelt joy among
the members \of the - Catholic church in
i this city and vicinity, and although as yet
no authentic report that he in reality has'
received the appointment has been received
in this city his adherents, who are legion,
express no doubt but what the rumor will
be eventually confirmed.
.Father Grace, as every one, Catholics
and Protestants alike, who knows him, ad- !
dressed him, was born in County Wexford,
Ireland, in 1842. He .was educated in the

studied under Bishop Furlong, and passed
through the courses of All Hallows College,
Dublin, being ordained to the priesthood
in 1867. In - September of that - year he
came to California and assumed charge of
the parish at Red Bluff. He was subse
quently transferred to Grass Valley, and
came to Sacramento in July, 1881. He is a
man who is universally beloved by all who
know him, and has a host of friends in all

Inquiry at the pastoral residence to
night elicited tyie . fact that intelligence
had been received that the appointment of
a Bishop had been made, but as yet they
had not heard who had received the ap

Father Grace has never solicited this de
served honor and if he receives the ap
pointment it will be forced upon him by
his host of friends who have been repre

A Chinese Thief.
Hung Toy, the Chinese servant of Joseph
Harvey, the well-known sporting man, was
booked at the City Prison yesterday on the
charge of grand larceny. Hung Toy was ar
rested last Friday on suspicion of having
stolen $-100 from a tin box which was kept in
a bureau drawer in Harvey's house, on Eddy
street, near Taylor. The money belonged to
Leopold de Meir, who is the complaining wit-
IB" THE OLDEN TIME.
A Country Where Private Feud Over
lapped Public Law. . '
The oddities of Scotch history are almost
inexhaustible. In a country where private
feud so long overlapped public law, and
where about half the land was populated
by an alien race with alien and primitive
institutions, "anything < might happen."
Romance was at home. The citizens lived
in a perpetual novel, after the manner of
Louis Stevenson. As late as 1716 we have
the case of the solicitor's pretty wife, who
shot the captain and disappeared into a
secret chamber in a country house till
matters blew over. The things that usu
ally happened were slaying?, revenges,
abductions of girls, concealment of dis
agreeable wives, fire raising, witchcraft,
diabolical possession, torture, forgery, bat
tle, murder and sudden death. Mr. Carlyle
somewhere writes as if John Knox brought
order among an anarchic people. In fact,
the killings, the long strings of revenges
and of murders, perpetrated to conceal the
evidences of a previous murder (as in the
Auchendrane tragedy), went, merrily on,
long after the Reformation. A well-known
assassin could buy off the kindred of his
victim (which was perfectly legal), or he
could skulk till he , escaped to France, or
he could come to court attended by a little
army, or he could bribe his Judge's, or he
could hold out in his own castle, or, finally,
he could always escape dressed as a lady
who had been visiting him in prison. This
simple trick never failed; thus did James
Mobr Macgregor escape from Edinburgh
Castle, about 1752, and "they all did it."
There must usually have been connivance
on the part of the jailers. Thus encour
aged by tho sympathy of a romantic and
high-souled race, the Scotch lived in a
perpetual state of drink and private war,
very serviceable to Scott Fittis in his in
teresting "Curious Episodes in Scottish
History." London News.

refers to low pressure, and ' is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When' the pressure is high in the interior

weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
kill produce an opposite result.

NEW, YORK, N. V., Feb. 11.- While business at
the Stock Exchange was ou a smaller scale than
yesterday the tendency of prices for the promi
nent railway issues was downward. â¢ The change,
in sentiment was not entirely unexpected/as some
of the plungers on the board have been rather reck
less in their purchases. The 'first disappointment
encountered by the bulls was the failure of Ameri
can securities in London to respond . to the pacific
utterances of. the Queen to Parliament in the mat
ter of the Venezuelan dispute.' "
Foreign bouses reversed their positions and sold
. and sterling exchange developed a little more
strength. Again there was selling. by traders who
invariably even up their contracts on the eve of a
holiday. â¢ The-. amount of stock offerings .was not
Urge in the aggregate, but still It was enough to
make considerable Impression on prices. ; Sugar
was. the most active stock and closed at about 2
points lower, at 1113/,, on fears of hostile legisla
tion at Washington. Manhattan scored the wild
est fluctuations. â¢ '1 he stock opened slightly higher
at 112, rose to 118V4 and finally broke to 108% on
efforts to realize. The best bid at the close w as 108.
Denials of the recent report about leasing the
property to the traction people had cons dorable to
do with the slump at the close. Tobacco was fever
ish and ranged between 78 and 80. with the final
transaction at.79V_. Leather Preferred jumped
two points to 673 4 c, and later fell to 66. | General
Electric made. a new high record, selling; up to

had secured important new contracts.' The. Anthra

HIDES AND SKINSâ The circular of W. B.
Sumner & Co. says: "The prospects in Hides and
Leather seem to be a trifle more encouraging, and
the trade looks for a more active business and per
haps a trifle better values. There Is no special
change in the Hide and Leather market, and prices
remain about the same as those which have ruled
during the past month. The usual volume of busi
ness in Hides and Leather has. been done since
January. 1, both in this market and In the East,
but the general improvement | expected has not oc
curred. .Wet salted Hides remain about the same,
but as there are small quantities on band in this
market prices have been well sustained and values
are perhaps a trifle firmer..' The dry Hide market

MR. DODGE SAW IT FIRST
Discovery That the Anti-Reilly
Resolution Was Not in
the Statutes.
IT CAN BE FOUND ELSEWHERE.
Some Influence Evidently at Work
That Reaches From Sacramento
to Washington.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, Feb. 11. \
The dispatch this morning from Wash
. ington stating that the action taken by the
last California Legislature * regarding the
refunding bill was missing from the
statutes for 1895 refers to the discovery
made by Assemblyman Clinton G. Dodge
last July.
When the members of the Legislature
â¢ received their official copies of the statutes
of 1895 from the State Printer, Mr. Dodge
at once looked for "concurrent resolution
No. 7," but it was not there.
Concurrent resolution No. 7 is the anti-
Reilly resolution that was passed and
wired to Congress during the last session.
The missing resolution was passed on
January 30, and in the indices of the pro
ceedings of both Houses it is duly re
corded, but in the index to the statutes
it is missing. Although everything else is
carefully preserved, the resolution which
caused the most noted struggle on the floor
.of. the Legislature of 1595 is not in the
book.
In an interview published in The Call
last July Assemblyman Dodge said:
I have looked through every resolution on
the statutes but I fail to see concurrent resolu
tion 7. Mention that there was such a resolu
tion is found in this paper-backed pamphlet,
but . not the text, and this is not official any
way.
In this book of statutes that is the his
torical archives of . the proceedings of the last
Legislature the anti-Reilly resolution is not
found either in the index or in the body of the
book. Neither is it in any other part of the
statutes by accident.
I have looked through the book twice, and
each time with the same result. Senator Earl,
C. G. DODGE*.
[Reproduced from a photograph.]
Assemblyman Belshaw and myself formulated I
the resolution and worked it through. There
was danger at one time of its not passing on
account of SlcGowan in the Senate and Bledsoe
in the Assembly, but after a hard struggle it
went through. _MW.Uj*W^Â»*il"('WWl_haii
congressman Maguire _aid that the passage
of the resolution by the California Legislature
contributed materially to the defeat of the
measure in Congress. 'â¢ I suppose it is one of
tale Printer Johnson's mistakes, although it
is a lasting shame that the resolution should
not be preset ved along with the rest of the
doings of the last Legislature.
Assemblyman Dodge saw the dispatch
from Washington to-day and, of course,
was not surprised.
"It almost appears now as if there was
something more , than mere accident that
the anti-Reilly resolution was not printed,"
said Mr. Dodge to-day. I "The Huntington
lobby is, of course, making the most of the
fact that it is not there, but there is a rec
ord of it in the House, as it was wired
to Congress immediately on its passage.
According to the dispatch the resolution
does not appear on the Congressional Rec
ord or any document to be found at the
Capitol, with the exception of the follow
ing brief paragraph in the Record: 'By
Mr. Maguire â memorial by the Legisla
ture of California protesting against the
passage of the Reilly funding bill. To the
Committee on the Pacific Railroads.'
"This does not appear to be chance work,
but it looks as though something far more
systematic than chance had been at work
and that it extends from Sacramento to
Washington. However,' there is plenty of
evidence that the resolution exists," even if
it has no official place on the statutes.
"It is to be found in the Assembly Jour
nal and also in the record of the final his
tory of Senate and Assembly bills. Con
gressman Maguire says he believed he read
the teiegaphed report on the floor of the
House.' If he did it should be in full in the
Congressional Record.
"The discovery that the statutes are in
complete was made by me, and I knew at
the time I missed the anti-Reilly resolu
tion that more .would be heard ;of it. I
hope that action will be taken in time to
inform every Congressman that although
not; in the record, the resolution is an ex
pression of the spirit of California on re
funding." _________________
DATE FOR STUDENT LABOR
Work by the Collegians on the
Berkeley Campus on Feb
ruary 28 and 29.
Miller Is Baseball Manager â Ordi
nance Amendmentâ License Re- -?
portsâ News Notes.
a BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 11.â It ; has been
definitely decided that the period to be set
aside for the work of the student . labor
brigade will be the 28th and 29th of * this
â  tein d r i d?y^ an d Saturday.' Regent
soonei bnt Vh ed that U** commenced
Booner, but the preliminary work to 'be
done by the university workmen will delay
it until that time. X The {devoting . of only,
two days to the work is contrary to 7 the
expectations of the majority of . the { stu
dents, as the impression was spread abroad
at the outset that the time required would
be at' least a week. : The shortening of the
period is due to the fact that the work will
be less extensive than at first 7 outlined.
Instead of constructing a forty-foot drive
way from Center street through , Dr. Hil
gard's botanical ; gardens â to the football
grounds, a sixteen-foot walk will be made
in its place. 7 As far as is now known, the
greater part of the work to be done by the
students will be the construction of* this
walk. 77
Regent Reinstein, the prime mover in
the affair, states that the students must
not think that they are compelled to work
because they shouted We will" so lustily.
If, on mature 7 deliberation, they have
changed their opinion there is no desire to
shove the work upon them and compel
them to engage in it against their will.
They are urged, however, to weigh the
matter 7 carefully, to consider what 'it
means to the university in later years and
with what approval the taxpayers will re
ceive the news that the collegians are at
work on the grounds.
In addition to the building of the path
there is another improvement contem
plated. It is the -removing of the tool
house on Strawberry Creek, south of South
Hall, to a position { near the Mechanics'
building, so that it will have motive power
close at hand. This chance would allow a
path to be constructed -along the edge of
Strawberry Creek and take in some of
the prettiest spots in the park.
The carpenters will immediately com
mence the erection of , another bridge
across Strawberry Creek. It will be built
from the timber of the large trees cut down
to make way for the path. It will be rustic
in its effect and will be strong enough to
admit of vehicles passing over it. The
grading will be done immediately after
the completion of the bridge.
Though the majority of the co-eds have
decided not to serve lunch to the laborin-r
collegians, yet there are. some who still
favor the idea, among whom are -, Miss
Millicent Shinn '79, a graduate student.
Miss Shinn presided at the meeting of the
young women when they voted down the
proposition, and was most enthusiastic in
her support of the scheme. There is some
talk of calling still another meeting to
reconsider the matter.
The authorities have expressed their
willingness to delay the illuminating of
the grounds until the evening of the last
day of the student work, so that the first
turning on of the electric fluid might add
to the celebration which is being planned
for that time.

The Laundry Farm Railroad
Negotiating With Property-
Owners.
MOVES TO SAVE CHINAMEN.
Officer Greenwald Found in Bed
Unconscious From Gas Escaping 7.
From a Leak.
â¢ Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
.903 Broadway, Feb. 11, 1896. J"
. The conversion of the California Rail
way, or as it is more generally known, the
Laundry Farm road, from a steam line
into an electric road is the source of some
interesting correspondence which may re
sult in the change being made. The first
letter is from Benham * & Thomas under
date of January 8 and is as follows: .
California Railroad Companyâ Gentlemen:
It was generally understood a year or two ago
that you were considering the change of the
Laundry Farm road to an electric system. That
the plan was abandoned is evident. What can
be done that will induce you to make the im
provement? We have recently purchased a
tract in the vicinity of Laundry Farm and con
sider the change would enhance its value, and
think other property-holders who would be
benefited will be willing to assist the enter
prise. Please communicate with us on the
subject and oblige. r '".â  77
In reply to this General - Manager W. M.
Rand replies under date of January 9 as
follows :
Benham _ Thomas, 1,65 Ninth Street, Oakland,
Cal.â Gentlemen: About a year ago we did
seriously consider equipping the California
Railroad with electricity : but upon conferring
with the various property-owners along the
line as to what amount they would contribute
toward the cost of the improvement, we were
given little or no encouragement.
Inasmuch as we felt they would derive a
much greater and more immediate benefit
than ourselves through the rise in value of
their property, we decided to let the. matter
drop until such time as the aforesaid property
owners *vere willing to contribute a small por
tion of the benefits they would derive toward
the cost of the change. ,
At the present time the road is entirely free
from debt and. has cost us something over
$150,000. To change the motive power to
electricity and equip it with the necessary
cars will cost over $70,000. . . '"
Now, if .the property-owners along the road
will contribute $20,000 to be paid within
ninety (90) days after the change has been
made we will at once commence the work and
have the road in full operation early in the
spring and run a train every hour from 6 a. m.
to 12 midnight, connecting with the Southern
Pacific Company's trains for; San Francisco
and Alameda electric road for ail points in
Oakland and Alameda v
A subscription paper was circulated to
day by the gentlemen named among prop
erty-owners who have an interest in the
proposed change, ' and nearly $2000 se
cured. From this they are encouraged to
believe- that the ' $20,000 will . be forth
coming. ' . â "''.-â â¢'â â /y,
THE POLICE COURT.
Its Existence Attacked by Ex-Mayor
â  Chapman in a Chinese Case.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 11.â The trial of
Ah Quay, the Chinese lottery -dealer at 473
Eighth street, has given ex-Mayor M. C.
Chapman an opportunity to get before the
Supreme Court a question which has been
passed on ly that body several times, in
cluding an occasion when, as Mayor, one
of his appointees was ousted from office, j
The ex-Mayor had associated with him
his partner, Tom Bradley, while at his
side sat ''Big Jim," king of the lottery
dealers. Ah Sing of 417 Tenth street, who
is awaiting trial on the charge of offering
to bribe the police officials, 7 was flitting
about. â¢ The proceedings were reported by
Stenographer I*. M. Walsh for the defense
and by Court Reporter Miller for the peo
ple. Prosecuting Attorney H. A. Melvin
was assisted by Deputy District Attorney
Len S. Church. y . 77
Attorney Chapman filed the following
type-written demurrer at the proper time,
which was speedily overruled:
That said complaint does not state facts suf
ficient to constitute a crime or public offense.
Tnat said court has no jurisdiction over the
person of the defendant.
That said court has no jurisdiction over the
subject of the action.
The demurrer was promptly overruled
by Judge Wood and Attorney Chanman
then made a motion to dismiss the case on
the following grounds:
That the. said pretended Police Court of Oak
land has no legal existence under the constitu
tion and laws of this State. -.-...,â¢
That Fred V. Wood falsely and illegally pre
tends to be a city justice of the peace and as
such holds said police court.
That _aid Fred V. Wood is not and never was
a city justice or . police judge and has no
power or authority to examine, hear or try
this ,: defendant in respect to the matter
charged in this complaint.
The 7 trial 7 then proceeded in the usual
manner, the defense offering no testimony.
The defendant was found guilty and fined
$100, with the alternative of fifty days in
jail. A notice of appeal was filed at once.

MESZENMEYEK RETURNS.
Did Not Believe the Officers Would Make
... an Effort to Secure Him. â¢â¢-'.''
OAKLAND, Cal., ? Feb. 7.;. 11.â Deputy
Sheriff :' Al -? White - arrived from Victoria,
B. C, at 10:40 o'clock this morning with
Albert Menzeumeyer, who was wanted for
the?? shooting of Perkins at - Lorin .on
Christmas eve. He v refused to talk about
the shooting and denied all -knowledge of
the affair. .
-.En route to Oakland Menzenmeyer told
White that" he went to Stockton after the
trouble with Perkins and thence to Sacra
mento, where he ; stayed ? a . few days," and
returned to San ? Francisco by y steamer.
He says he ; worked his way ; north over
land instead of going lun ! l by water, as > re
ported. He made no objection to coming
back, and. even waived all formalities -of
extradition ; f: but ? it was necessary to â¢ take
him before the ? i Supreme Court of 7 the
Province before he could be taken from
the country. XX/XX 'XX
: From the Deputy Sheriff's story it seems
; the Victoria X police "â â¢â â . watch all strangers
; closely who come j into their city, and ]it
was I soon Â« discovered . that Menzenmeyer
read with deep interest all i the .' California
papers he could get hold of, and 7 often: it
was found 7 that 7be would y clip -certain
articles out. By securing duplicate copies
the officers soon discovered? the {{clippings
â¢ taken j referred .to ? the Perkins shooting, '
â¢and at once came to the 7 conclusion that
he was in someway closely connected with
the case. 7He was arrested on a charge of
drunkenness in order ;to hold " him until
the officers ; here could be communicated
with. 7 â â 'â :â â  / : ,/'XXiv' :; X-.> : X'X:X.X//y:'' : X
He admitted he < was ; the - man. wanted,
but did not believe the authorities would
go to the expense of sending for him, but
when they did he readily consented to re
turn home. W. P.* and Chesley Perkin3,
relatives I of the 7 man Menzenmeyer shot,
accompanied Mr. White to give such testi
mony as 'might have been required :to
secure the surrender of. the prisoner,- but
their services were not needed.

lI'DONOUGH RELEASED.
Dr. Green Pails to Prosecute the Case,
. Fearing the Publicity. .â Â
OAKLAND. Cal., Feb. 11.â The prelim
inary examination of John McDonough,
the young West Oaklander charged with
garroting "Dr. I.E. Green," now known
as E, G. Douglass, was taken up in the Po
lice Court this afternoon, but the com
plaining witness failed to appear. After a
long. wait and no one showed up to prose
cute the case it was dismissed.", 7.
Christmas morning the officers found a
man out near the- Sixteenth-street station
in an insane condition. He was confined
in - the County Jail : several â  weeks and
finally sent to the Agnews Asylum. At
the examination he told a wandering
story of his life, claiming to be : Dr. ; I. E.
Green. The treatment at the asylum was
such that he recovered his mind, and sev
eral weeks ago he returned to Oakland. /â : XX
Going into a saloon one day he â¢ saw
John McDonough. :He caused his arrest
on the charge of garroting him and caus
ing the insanity. . In an interview Green
admitted that was not his proper name,'
but refused to give it, saying it would in
i'ure his practice. He related how Mc
)onough had appealed for help and when
given money followed" him until the op
portunity offered â¢ and - then held him up,
leaving him in the condition found. >;
Recently he swore to a complaint against
McDonough under the name of E. 'C.-
Douglas, but has not been seen since.

7 908 Broadway, Feb. 11. [ '
- . Some information from the Transvaal
just received in private letters to Dr. O. L.
Jones of this .; city, throws . considerable
light on the hurried return of Cecil Rhodes
to South Africa from London.
"My letters are now a month old," said
Dr. Jones to-day, "and yet the return of
Rhodes is foreshadowed in : them. . A few
weeks ago there was an attempt made to
create the belief that the Americans and
Englishmen under arrest were in danger
of being shot. Having been in thecountry
so long, and so, recently as I have, I felt
that I could speak with some authority,
and when the excitement was highest I
said in an interview that the' Boers would
do ?no killing, and that 7 the life of a
prisoner in the Transvaal was not at all a
terrible existence. "/ What I said was true,
and my most recent letters bear "out the
statement. Most of 7 the Uitlanders are
out on bonds and no one has been killed
nor is likely to \ be. I am told that the
prisoners were ' not y even deprived abso
lutely of their liberty. â  They were allowed
to walk outside the prison and frequent
the places of amusement, and in some in
stances they even staved away from the
jail all night.. The Boers always move
slowly and in "i this case they seem to have
moved slower than ever. -
, - "The ; people in the Transvaal believe
that the policy of the Uitlanders is to en
tirely . surround y the Boer country, and
! when ready descend upon it. It was for

this purpose that Matabeleland was se
cured. Now it is believed that Cecil Rhodes
will " approach ' the \ Transvaal from Rho
desia, and will find or make som excuse for
demanding an indemnity. It would never
do for an expedition | to leave Cape Colony
or Natal,' as the affair would be . altogether
too open, but raids such as Jameson's
from the north cannot openly be charged
to the English, and if Rhodes disguises his
hand, as he is so well | able to do, the man
ner in which the- Boers will be deprived of
their territory will be such as to leave lit
tle field for interference from other powers.
' "Everybody seems to recognize the fact
that English have made up their
minds to possess the wealth of I the Trans
vaal if they can't get the = territory.* 7 Cecil
Rhodes is as popular in the Enerlish colo
nies now as he 7 ever was, and since his
resignation I am told that he has taken
a very active part in the secret society
that exists for the union of all the colo
nies. That country is now of supreme
interest to gold i miners and the trouble
there will I riot cease ;; for some time. Re
cent discoveries have made it certain that
the country is richer even than was 7 pre
viously supposed, but the fact is not being
exploited, as the Uitlanders are not anx
ious for y a large immigration until they
have taken the cream of the gold from the
mines"y..XyXX-./X:,/
7" Dr. Jones has just received a little medi
cine-case from Johannesburg that 7he lost
in that country over a year ago. It was
recovered by a witch-doctor in a most re
markable manner. XX&S&SEkW&'X-'-
XX "The witch-doctor is one :of ; the . most
remarkable sights in the Boer- country,"
said Dr. Jones. 77 "He is a doctor, a witch,
a detective and everything I that will turn
in money. 7 , He professes cto ; trail by scent
and whenever a white man loses anything
he always employs a witch-doctor to find
it. I lost my little case and had to leave
the country before 7it was found, but my
partner has since recovered it through one
of these medicine men and has sent it to
me." " â  ": ,-y-*.. : -. \X':X *â

The Fallmer Girl's Father Indignant

. ALAMEDA. Cal., Feb. 11.â The people
of Alameda? thronged through 7 their new
City? Hall all day to-day. It was the first

PAINE'S CELERY COMPOUND
The Best Remedy in the World-It
Makes People Well.
There is one true specific for diseases arising from impure blood and a debilitated
nervous system, and that is Paine's celery compound, so generally prescribed by phy-
sicians. It is probably the most remarkable remedy that the scientific research of this
country has produced. Prof. Edward E. Phelps, M.D., LL.D., of Dartmouth College,
first prescribed what is now known the world over as Paine's celery compound, a posi-
tive cure for dyspepsia, biliousness, liver complaint, neuralgia, rheumatism, all nerv-
ous diseases and kidney troubles. For the latter, Paine's celery compound has suc-
ceeded again and again where everything else has failed.
benefit of the public. Men, women and
children wandered through the corridors
and rooms all day. There was very general
surprise expressed at the massiveness and
superior arrangement of the interior and i
the great abundance of room. Every de- i
partment of the city has more room almost
than it knows what to do with, and yet
there is |an immense room, 80 feet by 30,
that is not used at all. Very many as
cended to the tower, from which coign of
vantage the town and its surroundings are
viewed to better advantage than from any
other eminence. Superintendent Frodden
was on hand to show visitors around and
explain the construction, and was as proud
of the achievement- as though it were his
own particular house. When the people
see what a fine City Hall -. they have ob
tained . at .uch a very '. reasonable outlay
they universally approve the ' move that
built- it. Nothing that was ever done in ;
Alameda by the municipal government has
proved to be so popular. * : : !

dynamos aud electrical * appliances for the
enlarged electric-light plant, opened at the
regular meeting 7 Monday night and 7 con
sidered by the Committee on Lights, were
thought by a majority of tha members to
be too high. 7No conclusion was ; arrived

the proposals went over for one week.

SAN RAFAEL HAS A PRODIGY
It Can Boast of a Girl Burglar
Only Eleven Years of
Age.
MANY HOUSES ENTERED BY HER
Her Name Is Mary Maurico and She
Is Now in Mount St. Joseph ?
Orphan Asylum.
Mary* Maurico, the girl burglar of San
Rafael, is now an inmate of Mount St.
Joseph Orphan Asylum*, and every effort
will be made to reform her.
For the past two months numerous burg
laries and petty thefts occurred in San
Kafael, and it was not till about ten days
ago that suspicion fell upon Mary. A visit
to the residence of her parents confirmed
the suspicion, as most of the articles
stolen Irom the houses broken into were
found there. Mary was arrested and con
fessed that she was the much-sought-for
burglar.
Mary is a bright girl, 11 years of age, and
when she was taken before Judge Ange
lotti Frank Smith, a rancher, took an in
terest in her and asked the court to ap
point him her guardian instead of sending
her to a reform school, which would for
ever leave a stigma upon her name.
The court consented, and Mary was sent
to Mount St. Joseph Asylum. Mary's
parents upon learning where she had been
sent, applied for a writ of habeas corpus to
produce her in court. It was made re
turnable a week past Monday,' but at
Smith's request the argument was con
tinued till yesterday.
In the meantime Smith called upon Sec
retay Kane of tne Pacific Coast Society for
the Suppression of Vice, and yesterday he
went to San Rafael and applied to Judge
Angelottl for letters of guardianship,
which were granted. Secretary Kane
brought Mary to the City with him and
took ncr to Mount St. Joseph Asylum.
â 'The girl is intelligent and tractable,"
said Secretary Kane yesterday, "and I be
lieve she will become a good woman. Mv
opinion is that she is suffering from klep
tomania. If she went into a house and
fancied a thing she would not rest till she
stole it. She would walk into a house and
make her way to the piano, and the first
thing the occupants knew of her being
there was hearing some one playing on the
instrument. Her parents must have
known what she was doing, as she took all
the stolen articles to them.
"She did not have the least idea that she
was doing wrong by breaking into other
people's houses and stealing their goods.
Now that she has been convinced to the
contrary she seems penitent and promises
to be good in the future."

Half of the Warships Are to Be Built

Mrs. M. Ishida, the American wife of
Mr. Ishida, ex-Commissioner from Japan
to the Columbian Exposition, has arrived

here from Yokohama, and is at the Palace.
. She says Japan has decided to build six
or seven new warship?, and to rush the
work as fast as possible on her fortifica
tions. She is in fear of Russia. .//'/
Mrs. Ishida was at a dinner attended by
Marquis Ito, General Idomolito and other
tamous men just before leaving for. San
â¢ Francisco* Their great plans of /check
mating Russia she sets forth fully. 7
Mrs. Ishida was formerly Miss Tous
saint of Chicago. She was married to the
distinguished Japanese about â  two years
ago, and has most of the time since then
been living in Japan. ... - i/y.-
Marriages of American' girls 7 thus are
rare. â  It has been' said that in all Japan
there could not be found over half a dozen
European and American girls . who had
married Japanese. X'-yXX^/y-.
Mrs. Ishida, however, thinks -there are
rather more than that. She says she has
been very happy in Japan. ' Her husband
is engaged in important business enter
prises since his retirement as Commis
sioner at the World's Fair. - His brother
is a member of the Japanese ' Parliament.
Mrs. Ishida says things are "in rather a
serious state politically in Japan,- though
in a business way the country, since the
war.is more prosperous probably than it has
ever been. A year ago wages were 45 cents
. and 50 cents a day. Now they are 80 cents
to $1. Articles of merchandise also â  have
gone up 50 per cent. ,'",_
What concerns the people, though, is
the possibility of more war when they are
not ready for it.
"There is great fear at the present time
of Russia," said the lady. "Nobody knows
*what that country intends, but its attitude
is regarded as anything but friendly.
What Russia wants is to get down to
Korea. fjEÃÂ£Bm_\%\_a
"When it will strike remains to be seen.'
If Japan can keep it off, however, she
-won't have any war for seven or eight
years more. Then she will be in a good deal
better shape. Another generation ! will
have come on which can take the field.
"Of course ; Japan is very thickly popu
lated, but she would be in better condition
then than now. Meantime, Japan . is go
ing to have a lot more warships arid forti
fications built. They are building fortifi- ;
cations now as fast ns they can, and it is
wonderful the progress they are making. '
"I was at a dinner, in company with my
hnsband, at Tokio just before I came away.
At that dinner were gathered ' some of the
most famous men of Japan. There was
among them the Marquis Ito,' formerly
} Count Ito, who was so conspicuous in the
recent war.
"Besides him there was General Idomo
, lito, who commanded" all the fleets at the
time of/the war, and three other noted
generals. 7 There was also present -an old
Damio. a favorite of the Emperor. They
were all much concerned about the present
condition of Japan and the attitude of
Russia.

upon America as their ' great friend.' and
be thought that if other countries asked
things!, that were ; unjust ;â â  from : Japan,
America might come in and help. â ; * ..
.. ; "He said Japan /â  would go on making
fortifications as fast as possible, and that
she would have some more '^warship built.
About half of these, he said? would be built
in America and the other half in England.
' "I think they intend to build about six
or seven more ships. They are building a
new fort at Yokohama now, arid . rushing
work as fast as they can..: I noticed that
as I came away. They are piling up stone
after stone, till one who had been there a
year ago would hardly know the harbor.
"GeneralTdomolito is a Satsurna man,'
and over 6 - feet high." '(All the generals
are great big men. The trouble is that no
body in Japan knows just what Russia's
next move will be. She wants Japan evi
dently, arid is figuring out how she is go
ing to strike. ' 'â¢ : ..V?
"At the dinner I have mentioned there
were a number â â 'â  of â¢ speeches. They all
spoke, in fact, and the subject of the war
with Russia was generally discussed. "â '-â 
- "It is believed to be Russia's intention
to sweep the seas, take all trie islands of
Japan? : if possible, and go down 7 to Korea,
and thus command the whole country." \
One reason Russia wants to acquire more
territory undoubtedly, as long conceded,
is that she wants to get an open harbor on
the Pacific. The - harbor of Vladivostock
has for a month, past been frozen up sol
idly, so that the Russian Government has
to run immense ice-breaking ships every
hour day arid night to keep the harbor
open: ' It is so every winter and will be
so till the end of time. './'-
Russia, therefore, in addition to the am
bition of acquiring more territory, wants
to get south, where it is warm, and thus
secure harbors that will be open all the
year. With the acquisition of Japan and
Korea she would control the Pacific. '7
"All the generals looked at the matter
very seriously,'' said Mrs. Ishida. "But
they will do their best to forestall . Russia.
More ships and fortifications will be built
as fast as possible, and the empire will try
in every way to be ready for the attack." \
Mrs. Ishida will be here for a â  few days
only and then will go on to Chicago to
visit friends. The important news which
she brings will be of widespread interest.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1896.
WILL SUE FOR
MALICIOUS ARREST.

Papers in the Case Missing
; From the Justice Clerk's

BOND AND 7 COMPLAINT GONE.
Pittsburg Phil's y Friend Says He
? Liquidated Under Duress and
Will Ask Damages. * 'â '-
If J. P. Maloney, Pittsburg Phil's con
fidential man, carries out 'the intentions
that are - indicated in an answer filed in
the Justices' Court "X yesterday Colonel
Theodore C. Marceau,- the photographer,
will soon have a $25,000 suit for malicious
arrest on his hands. '. ...* . *' .'â 
Incidental to the threat of a heavy legal I
battle between the turfman and the pic
ture-man there is consternation in y the
Justice Clerk's office regarding the papers
in a Justice Court suit between the two.
The most important documents in the
caseâ that may have a material bearing on
the final issueâ are missing ' and no one
seems to know .- where they are at the
present time. 7 A search of all the papers
in the possession: of the 'clerk has been
made without result and Clerk Williams is
now trying to ascertain who carried them'
away. â¢â  â . . : - 'X'"V "
'In March last Maloney visited the
Marceau studio and sat for his portrait.
The turfman , was not â  satisfied , with
common 7 panels, but ordered the } most
expensive kind, agreeing, as he admits, to
pay $40 for the lot. When : they were
finished he alleges that he was disgusted
with the job. that the pictures bore very
little resemblance to him, were very poorly
executed ' and that he refused â¢ to accept
them. _ â â "â¢''-â '": X â "'.' XX; fX it
He also says that while taking the sitting
he was asked by.the photographer to allow
a life-size portrait to be made, and that he
consented,- though warning the operator
that he wouid not buy the same and that
the likeness must be made at the expense
and risk of the house. ' â¢
When his, refusal, to accept the pictures
reached the ears of Colonel Marceau, that
personage at once instituted suit for $225
for "material and labor furnished," alleg
ing that' the turfman had ordered that
amount of portrait. , . ; â â¢ â¢ â¢
While the suit was pending Maloney was
called East on; urgent business and pre
pared' to depart. ' Just as he was leaving
the Palace Hotel where he resided, 'a
stalwart blue-coated guardian of the public
peace appeared with an order for his arrest
on a charge of attempting .to defraud his
creditors. a With . the policeman came ' a
representative of Colonel Marceau, who
said that if the bill was paid in full at once
Mr. Maloney would be permitted to go on
his way rejoicing. Not having time to
stop and put up a bond for such a trifle as
$225, Maloney paid the money and left on
the next train.
7 Recently, the turfman returned, full of
wrath and; a determination to make the
photographer pay dearly for the trouble
he had caused. > v - Â ; -
In the answer filed yesterday he pot only
demands the return of the $225 paid under
"duress and force of circumstances," but
expressly states that he has been injured
by the enforced payment to the extent of
$25,000, and that he proposes to sue for the
same. The answer concludes as follows:
And fora further and separate defense and
counterclaim delendant alleges that this suit
was brought and an order of arrest issued
without any authority of law and in violation
of the statute, and without any sufficient ex
cuse therefor, and on March 30, 1895, this de
fendant was Illegally and at the behest of
plaintiff arrested while he was about departing
trom San Francisco on business and just as he
was leaving his hotel, to wit, the Palace Hotel,
for the train departing eastward ; that he had
not time to consult his attorney, obtain legal
advice or prepare to give any bonds or protect
himself at all, and being entirely at the mercy
of the plaintiff < and the officer of the law he

Charles 'Â£;:â  Hanlon - has charge of 'the

amine the complaint filed by Marceau's
attorneys and the bond given by the pho

to cover- damages he was unable to see
them. They were missing from the pigeon
hole where the clerk had placed them and

CRUSHED IN THE ENGINE

â ''â ;.'-XX. '?'-... ; and Eccentric.
'â 'â  The steamer Zealandia, .which'? arrived
from -Panama -* and way ports yesterday
evening, had [ several misfortunes â¢ aboard
during the round - trip. After being tied
up 7 for a 'long, time at j Martinez she was
chartered by .the j Pacific Mail | Steamship
Company ; and made a fair start .on - her
initial voyage. : .7yâ. ,-,. XyX y?77?;;?y ?
Among the passengers was a* Mrs.
Nicholson, who was on her way to Guate
mala to join her husband, who was super
intendent of one of the coffee plantations.
She was well known in society circles in
the Mission, and a great number of people
were down to see her 0ff.. ..0n the voyage
she was taken sick, and- when landed at
San Jose de Guatemala fears were enter
tained for her recovery. On. the return
trip it was learned 5 that she had died at
Retahalehu; after joining her husband,
and had been buried. The news came on
the top of a sad accident that had hap
pened at Panama .and helped . to deepen
the gloom that pervaded the ship. : ;
On January 23 last the Zealandia sailed
from Panama en route for San | Francisco.
First Assistants Engineer Dave j Zimmer
man was in charge of the engine-room and
a few moments after leaving the dock he
informed the captain | that one of the
journals was hot and that he would have
to stop the engine. He was instructed to
keep on for a few. minutes longer ana then
he â¢ could stop. 7. When the harbor was
cleared Zimmerman was told that all was
clear and that he could take bis own time
about getting the machinery into working
order. He began work at once and jas be
was fixing the . journal ; his * head ; got . be
tween the airpump and the , eccentric.
There ws a crunch of human bones and all
was over. . The steamer at once put back to
Panama and the engineer was buried there.
Dave Zimmerman was well known in San
Francisco. He was 38 years old and 7 was
formerly chief assistant on the Acapulco.
About four months ago be was married to
one of the belles of the Mission and she
was down at the Zealandia to meet him
last night. When the sad news was given
her she was heartbroken and had to be car
ried to a hack and taken home.
The passage outside of these sad incidents
was an uneventful; one and the steamer
made good time. Off Point Concepcion she
passed the San Juan, so that vessel can be
expected early -this morning. The cabin
passengers were as follows :\
Mr. and Mrs. D. L. Whitney, Rev. and Mrs. A. -

WAGNER UNDER ARREST
Developments \in the Case; of the
Boy ? Burglars at \ Oak
land. â¢

H^LD AT SAN LUIS OBISPO.
Archie? Majors, â¢ Brother of: One of the
Boys, Was With Him âAn ;
; ? Appeal for Mrs. Wagner.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,) : '
y 908 Broadway, Feb. 11. jy
'XX A new feature in ; the * case . of the boy
burglars developed by the arrest of /J. A.
Wagner j at San,- Luis .* Obispo. For some
days it has been known that Wagner was
wanted in Oakland, and it was known that
the failure to pay alimony. was not the sole
reason that he was in demand. 7
â â â '-: Chief Lloyd sent an officer to San Mateo.
There 'it was learned that "Wagner had
shipped his } furniture y from San Luis
Obispo under the name of A. C. Majors.
This is the name of Archie Majors, brother
to Abe Majors, now unSer arrest. ' Further
inquiry? proved that Wagner and the elder
Majors boy were together. . ;."..;.
-y Wagner is the man that married the
widow of Lloyd Majors, the father of r the
boys. Mrs. Majors- Wagner was awarded
a divorce ;on the ground of 'â  cruelty and
.Wagner was ordered to â  pay alimony. ? : He
was put in prison and made promises to
Judge "Woods to do r certain things, but
instead of doing so he skipped out. , When
he' attempted ;to get the ; custody ?of j his
children from Judge Seawell a few weÂ«ks
ago in San Francisco ; he was accompanied
to the courtroom by : Mrs. "Willmore, the
mother of Burt'Willmore, who : is' now in
jail; and by Archie Majors. 7 , ..
Â Since . the. ' arrest of the : youthful : safe
crackers ' Mrs. Willmore has been under
police surveillance, and Chief Lloyd
thought it would be well :; to know where
Wagner was. so he sent two warrants for
his arrest to San Luis Obispo. ;--â -;
X To-night the Chief received a telegram
asking if he wanted Archie Majors, but he
said that he did * not,- as he only wanted
Wagner.; He will send an .-'officer for the
latter.' The warrants against Wagner are
for refusing to support his seven children
and for contempt proceedings. It is' also
well understood that he may know some
thing about the career of the boys now in
jail.
--Chief Lloyd said to-night that some new
evidence had come to light, and it is not
improbable tbat i proceedings . may ' be ; be
gun looking to the future welfare of Ina
Willmore_ to whom Abe -Majors, was en
gaged 7to - be: married with the mother's
consent, although she is but 13" years old.
"vVe have full knowledge of where Mrs.
.Willmore is," said the Chief, "and believe
that she is a very interesting part of these
proceedings. I have not had any Occasion
to change .my J opinion [ expressed ' some
days ago. but have " learned much to con
firm it." - *
"When ' Majors â¢ and "Willmore, the . boy
burglars, were brought up in- the Police
Court again this afternoon for examination
on the charge of 'cracking Gimrd's safe
Mrs. Wagner* and a lady friend were by
the side of Majors, but Mrs. Willmore was
not ,: present. . y Attorney Ayer said Mrs.
Willmore had come to him and wanted to
attend the examination, B but he - had g ad
vised, her not to do so in her present men
tal condition. 7 â  -
, Since. the arrast of the boys it has been
learned that they had the tin tubes "in
.which they placed their dynamite charges
made at Montanya's tin store. These
tubes arc about three inches long and
made just large enough so that they could
ba luserted in a half-inch drill hole. After
getting the tubes the boys charged them
with dynamite .themselves;, from the big
sticks which * they stole ' from the quarry'
out -Broadway. : This 7 must have been a
verj' dangerous undertaking, and it is a
wonder that they did not" blow their own
heads off in doing this work.
-'â  Majors was at one time employed at the
narrow-gauge mole selling papers for the
agent there, Charles Hayward. About
this time he had quite a local reputation
as a boxer, having, a boxing-room in the
basement of his mother's, home., Hebe
came so skillful that his employer offered
to .match him against any other boy of his
weight. .' "/".-:' '-'...
7 While . employed down there Majors al
ways bore a good reputation. - -During â¢ his
idle 'moments at the mole the boy bad a
chance to read considerable and it may be
that at this time he got hold of some books
which did not have a good effect upon his
character. - Xy 'â â 'â '.' 7 7 7.."
yF. R. Girard was . called as the first wit
ness at the examination to-day. He again
detailed the facts concerning the /cracking
of his safe. He said the store was locked
up at [81 o'clock ; the / evening before the
burglary. He explained '-what' was â¢ con
tained in the safe; as detailed . yesterday.
At 3:30 the case was concluded, and. the
boys held for trial in the Superior Court,
in- the sum of $3000 each. ' /
Mrs. S.C. Sanford, secretary of the Ala
meda County .Humane: Society, has writ
ten the following letter: / â¢/
- Editor Call : * I would like to call the atten
tion of the public through , your paper to the
case of Mrs. Wagner, the mother of Abe Majors. -

WITHOUT THE WINGS.
The City Hall Dome Statue Will Bo
Finished as, a Plain
-./^; Figure. ,;
-Â* At their meeting yesterday the Board of
City Hall Commissioners decided to have
the figure of an angel that is to surmount
the dome of the tower , finished without
wings.
Mayor Sutro was not present, but Audi
tor Brodericl. and City and County Attor
ney Creswell, the. other Commissioners,
listened to Architect Shea, who told them
that as the figure is now modeled it is not
strong enough to withstand the immense
pressure which the force of the wind blow
ing against the wings would create. The fig
ure, he said, was too narrow to admit of
the necessary braces. Mr. Creswell - said .
he was oppoued to removing the wings on
account of the looks, but that he was still
more opposed to delay." A motion to have
the statue finished without the pinions was
adopted. " ;
