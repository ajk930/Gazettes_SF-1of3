SILVER'S FRIENDS
GAIN A VICTORY,
Michigan Republicans in
the White Metal
Column.
HARD STRUGGLE WON.
Financial Plank in the Minne
apolis Platform Given an
Indorsement
DEPEW'S WARNING IN VAIN.
vÂ»i's the Convention the Party Must
Deciare for "Sound" Money
or Fall.
DETROIT, Mich., May 7.â The Michi
gan Republican State Convention to-day
elected four delegates at large and alter
nates to the Republican National Conven
tion, two Presidential electors at large,
Presidential electors representing the
twelve Congressional districts of the State
and a new chairman of the State Central
Committee, Hon. D. M. Ferry of Detroit.
The convention instructed its delegates at
large to vote for McKinley so long as his
name should remain before the St. Louis
convention.
The features of the convention were the
address of Hon. Chauncey M. Depew, who
dropped in on the delegates unexpectedly
a.nd made a ringing speech, and the vic
tory of the silver men in forcing the adop
tion of tue financial plank of the Minne
apolis convention of 1892. Tne "nara
money" men had control of the commit
tee on resolutions, there being but two ad
vocates of the white metal in it. The mi
nority, however, brought the fleht which
they had been unable to settle in commit
tee into the convention. They declared
that the convention should at least reaf
firm the plank of the last National Repub
lican Convention, and on this basis they
won their light after battling for an hour.
When Chairman A. W. Smith of the
State Central Committee called the con
vention to order at 12:30 o'clock this after
noon, he announced that he had a sui
pnse in store for the delegates, and pro
ceeded to introduce Hon. Ghauncey M.
.Depew of New York, who had been in
duced to stop off while passing through
tlie city with his party and make an art
dress, to the convention.
Mr. Depew was received with wild en- I
thusiasm by the delegates and spectators, !
and made a speech which kept the aud
ience laughing and cheering alternately
for half an hour. He said that he had
traveled through the so-called silver
States and talked with many persons on
the issues of the d*y, and everywhere tho
statement was made that they must have
free coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1,
hut with it th<iy niu^t have protection or
they could not live.
He declared that if the Republican Na
tional Convention did not declare for
sound money unequivocally, the great
States of New York, Connecticut, New
Jersey and Massachusetts, which are all
now as soundly .Republican as Michigan,
will be put by that act in the doubtful
column.
He referred to the statesmen whose
names are now before the public. As he
mentioned Allison, Morton and Reed in
turn there was moderate applause. As
McKinley's name fell from the speaker's
lips there was a spontaneous rising of the
delegates in a burst of wild applause
which lasted a couple of minutes.
As the tumult died away one of the dele
pates shouted, "How do you like that, Mr.
Depew?"
"When it comes to the vote, Michigan
will have but thirty- two," was the ready
response.
At the close of Depew's address he was
given three rousing cheers.
The platform adopted tc-day favors the
re : enuctment of the McKinloy bill and the
restoration of reciprocity. The McKinley
and money planks read as follows:
We are united in favor of the nomination of
William McKinley of Onio by the Republican
party for the office of the President of the
United States, and hereby instruct the dele
* gates selected at this convention to u^e all
honorable means to tecure his nomination so
long as his name is before the National Con
vention.
We are unyielding and uncompromising In
our demand for sound money. We are in
favor of the use of gold, silver and paper dol
lars in our currency, all maintained at a parity
a<= to purchasing and debt paying power. We
are opposed to any proposition that involves
the depreciation of any portion of our cur
rency, and therefore are opposed to the free
and unlimited coinage of silver by this coun
try alone under present conditions, believing
that 6uch coinage would destroy the parity
and depreciate and contract the currency.
S. W. Hopkins, on behalf of the minor
ity of the committee on resolutions, said
that the Republican National Convention
â¢in 1892 had stood for bimetallism and de
clared that trie financial plank in the
rnajoritv report just presented put the
party hack to Clevelandism and bond ism.
He said this country must not bow to the
powers across the ocean, and if this con
yen tion favored the policy of gold and
bonds we have no place in the Republican
party. Referring to that part of the ad
dress of Hon. Chauncpy M. Depew in
which that distinguished gentleman said
that if the Republican party did not de
clare for gold New York, Massachusetts,
New Jersey and Connecticut would be
found in the doubtful column, the speaker
asked :
"Shall we bow to threats likt* that?"
There were cries of ' # No, no," from all
over the ball.
Continuing, Mr. Hopkins said if the
delegates would stand by the rights of the
people the Republican party need not fear
the !uss of these States, and moved the
substitution of the following financial
Â» plank for that in the majority report:
The American people, from tradition and in
terest, favor bimetallism, and the Republican
party demands the use of both gold and silver
as standard money, demands that all dollars,
. bcthcr of gold, silver or paper, shall be of full
f iimi j *f,/f gJlgb^LS^^^^^ te **=^'^j^-**^^A.rf Â¥V
legal tender, providing full and equal purchas
ing and debt-paying power, thereby having a
parity of value, and to that end we demand c
purely American system of money based upon
gold and silver without advantage to either at
the mints of this Government.
We demand that all paper money issued by
the Government shall be redeemable in gold or
silver at the option of the Government.
We are opposed to the retiring of the green
backs, the money of the people, the savior of
the Union, the money favored by Lincoln.
A hot debate followed, which lasted for
an hour arM which was only ended by
Delegate Crissey of Midland moving that
the financial plank of the Minneapolis
platform of 1892 be substituted for both
the majority and minority reports on the
subject. This was received with favor and
the substitute was adopted and then the
resolutions as amended went through with
a rush, and the silver men raised a mighty
cheer over their victory.
HARRISON STATS AWAY.
The Ex- President Modestly Declines to
Influence Jndiana's Convention.
INDIANAPOLIS. Ind., May 7.â William
McKinley of Ohio had everything his own
way in Indiana to-day. The hope of his
opponents lay in the expectation that ex-
President Harrison would address the
convention this morning and create such
a whirl of enthusiasm for himself that the
intention to instruct, so plainly shown in
the district meetings the night before,
would not prevail. Harrison, however,
when a committee from the convention
waited upon him this morning, politely
declined the invitation without vouch
safing his reason. One of his friends ex
plains- it by declaring that he stayed away
lest his action in attending should be con
strued into an effort to influence the action
of the convention.
The instructions were contained in the
platform. They were passed by a viva
voce vote with probably about two-thirds
of the convention voting for them and
the other third giving voice to their op
position with lusty lungs. This done, the
convention proceeded to elect the dele
gates at large by ballot. Ex-Secretary of
the Navy H. W. Thompson, General Lew
Wailace, C. W. Fairbanks and F. M. Milli
ken were elected, the lirst two by accla
mation and the others by ballot.
The preliminary work thus finished the
convention proceeded to the nomination
of a State ticket, as follows:
For Governor, James A. Mount of Mont
gomery; Lieutenant-Governor, W. S. Hag
gard ; Secretary of State, W. D. Owen ;
Auditor, A. C. Daily; Treasurer, F. J.
Scholz; Attorney-General, W. A. Ketch
nni; Supreme Court Reporter, Charles F.
Remy; Superintendent of Instruction, D.
M. Geeting; Statistician, C. J. Thompson.
On the currency question the platform
says :
We are unalterably opposed to every scheme
that threatens to debase or depreciate our cur
repcy. We favor the use of silver as currency,
but to tht extent only and under such regula
tions that its parity with gold can be main
tained, and in consequence are opposed to the
free, unlimited and independent coinage of
sliver at a ratio of of 1U to 1.
BRYAN CHALLENGES CARLISLE.
The Secrrtnry Accused. of Tf* fending ' a
Policy He Once Denounced. , ' â -.- .
OMAHA, Nemr., May 7.â Hon. W. J.
Bryan to-day sent a challenge to Hon.
John G. Carlisle, Secretary of the Treasury
at Washington. In brief, Mr. Bryan says:
"Yon have changed your position upon the
paramount public issue, and are now de
fending a financial policy which you once
denounced. The advocate? of free and un
limited coinage at 16 to 1 admit your
opinion, but contend that you owe it to
the public to answer the arguments which
you yourself made in 1878 before attempt
ing to answer the arguments of others.
"Your record challenges you to join the
debate. Will you accept? Are you will
ing to take up your speech of 1878 and an
swer it, one proposition at a time? If you
are, you will silence those who doubt your
sincerity and question your motives. If
you are not willing to face your own argu
ments and overcome them you cannot
complain if your opponents adopt the
philosophy of Shakespeare and attribute
your cowardice to a guilty conscience."
THAT CO NFENTION FUND.
Chicago It Coin inn Vp Very Slowly With

CHICAGO, 111., May 7.â The gnaran
tors of the $40,000 subscription to the
Democratic National Convention fund held
a secret meeting this morning in the office
of Chairman Donnersberger of tbe local
committee to decide on a course of action
looking to the collection of the money sub
scribed, only $10,000 havine been paid.
Ben T. Cable, the National Committeeman
from Illinois, was present as the represen
tative of Levi Z. Leiter. An encouraging
view of the financial situation was taken,
and one of the committee said the second
$10,000 demanded by Chairman Harrity
would be in hand to-morrow, when a meet
ing of the subscribers would be held. The
men who signed the guarantee are respon
sible to the National Committee, and
prominent Democrats laugh at the idea of
the convention not being held here.

views. As a sop to the silver wing of the
party Senator Teller will be named as one
of the delegates, if he chooses to accept,
but the sentiment of the leaders who ai>
pear to have control of the party machine
in Colorade will be to discountenance a

event that silver is not recognized. There

SENATOR A LDRICH'S FIGURES.
JUcKinley Seeds a Hundred Store Vote*
to Gain a Majority.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 7.â The
House showed more interest in the Indiana
convention to-day than it did in the busi
ness that came before it Congressman
AJdrich of Illinois, who is an ardent cham
pian of Speaker Reed, does not agree with
the McKinley men that the indorsement
of the Ohio candidate at Indianapolis to
day definitely settles the matter.
"Of course," said Mr. Aldrich, "it would
be folly to say that it is not discouraging
to have a number of States all in one week
indorse McKinley. But by what author
ity can any one say that McKinley will
have a majority of the votes? According
to Manley's estimate, made public last
Monday morning, McKinley was then
credited with 275 votes. Since then we
concede that he has captured 14 in Cali
fornia, 4 in Indiana, 6 in Michigan, 2 in
Illinois and 10 in Missouri. That makes
36, does it not? Those added to the 275
we gave him increase his strength to 311.
Now let us suppose, for the sake of argu
ment, that he secures 14 more votes in
Indiana in addition to the 12 which we
have allowed h im. That makes 325.
"It is not unlikely that Colorado, Idaho,
Montana, Nevada and Wyoming, all silver
States, will throw their strength to Mc-
Kinley. They have thirty-two votes,
which will swell McKinloy's figures to 357.
That leaves him 100 short of a majority.
Now, where is he goiog to get the re
mainder?
"The contest is not settled by any
means. It is still anybody's light."
"Yon don't think, then, that the situ
ation at the present time takes any of the
candidates out of the race?"
â¢â¢No, unless it be ex- President Harrison,
and he, as is well known, is not a candi
date. All the others, so far as I know, will
continue to be in evidence."

HANGED FOR
MANY CRIMES,
Murderer Holmes' Career
Comes to an End on
the Gallows.
STUBBORN TO THE LAST
He Died as if Entirely In
different to His Awiul
Fate.
DECLARING HIS INNOCENCE.
The Execution Passed Off Without
Any Incidents of a Sensa
tional Nature.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., May 7.âHer
man W. Mudgett, alias H. H. Holmes,
was hanged this" mornine in the County
Prison for tne killing of Benjamin F.
Pietzel.
The drop fellatlO:l2o'cloctc, and twenty
minutes later he was pronounced dead by
the prison officials, Dr. Sharp and Dr.
Batcher.
The execntion was in every way entirely
devoid of any sensational features.
To the last Holmes was self-possessed
and cool, even to the extent of giving a
word of advice to Assistant Superintend
ent Richardson as the latter -was arrang
ing the final details. He died as ne had
lived, unconcerned and thoughtless, ap
parently, of the future, even with the rec
ollection still vividly before him of the
H. H. Holmes, alias Mudgett, the Arch Criminal of Modern History. Who Was
Hanged Yesterday.
recent confession in which he admitted
the killing of a score of persons of both
sexes in different parts of the country.
Almost his last words were a point-blank
denial of any crimes committed except the
deaths of two women at his hands by mal
practice.
Of the murder of several members of tbe
Pietzel family he denied all complicity,
particularly of the father, for whose death
he stated he was unjustly suffering the
penalty. With the prayer of the spiritual
attendants still sounding in his ears and
with a few low-spoken words to those
about him tbe trap was sprang.
There were comparatively few persons
gathered on the outside of the prison dur
ing the eariy part of the morning and the
morbid throng which the prison officials
expected would be drawn there by the
execution was lacking. Access to the
prison prior to the entrance of those per
mitted to witness the execution was not
allowed.
All the arrangements for the burial of
Holmes were entrusted by the murderer
to Mr. Rotan. The place of interment has,
it is understood, been selected, but those
who are most likely to know where the
grave is to be will not divulge the iov-a
tion.
Holmes retired about midnight and
slept soundly during the entire time until
called at 6 o'clock this morning. So sound
were his slumbers, in fact, that twice was
he called before awauening. When the
arrival of the Rev. Fathers Dailey and Me-
Pake to administer the sacrament was an
nounced he greeted them warmly, but
witii no show of emotion. For nearly two
hours they remained in the cell and then
were succeeded by Lawyer Rotan, the le
gal adviser of Holmes, who was also
greeted pleasantly. There were several
matters pertaining to Holmes' worldly af
fairs that will yet have to be settled and
this time was taken in giving the final de
tails and explanations. While discussing
his affairs breakfast was served, consisting
of eggs, toast and coffee.
When the raeal was ended, shortly be
fore 9 o'clock, Holmes dressed himself in
trousers, vest and cutaway coat of some
dark mixed goods of a pepper and salt ef
fect he aad worn frequently.
At 10 o'clocK the doors leading to the
long corridor in which was placed the
gallows were opened and, two by two, led
by the Sheriff's jury, the spectators
passea down. The last man had just
passed through the doors and the latter
closed when from behind was heard the
slow and measured tread of the death
party.
The suspense was almost painful, brief
though it was, when, preceded by Sheriff
Clements and Superintendent Perkins,
Holmes appeared and stepped on the trap.
On the right was Father Dailey, to the
left Fat; er McPake, and behind them
Lawyer Rotan and Assistant Superin
tendent Richardson. The little party
stood a moment looking down, and then,
in response to a signal from one of those
beside him, Holmes stepped forward. He
spoke slowly and with measured attention
to every wordâ a trifle low at first, but
louder as he proceeded, until every woid
was distinctly audible.
"Gentlemen," he said, "I have very few
words to say, in fact, I would make no
statemeut at this time, except that by not
speaking I may be made to acquiesce in
my execution. I only want to say that
the extent of my wrongdoings in the
taking of human life consisted in the
death of two women, they having died at
my hands as the result of criminal opera
tions. I wish to state also, however, so that
there will be no misunderstanding here
after, tnat I am not guilty of taking the
lives of any of the Pietzel family, the three
children or the father, Benjamin F. Piet
zel, of whose death I am now convicted,
and for which I am to-day to be hanged.
That is all."
As he ceased speaking he stepped back,
and kneeling between Fathers Dailey and
McPake, he joined with them in silent
prayer for a minute or two. Again stand
ing he sbook hands with all about him
and then signified his readiness for the
end. Holmes was the coolest of the wuole
yiarty. He even went to the extreme of
suggesting to Assistant Superintendent
Richardson that the latter should not
hurry himself.
"Take your time; don't bungle it,"
Holmes remarked as the official exhibited
some little haste, the outcome of nervous
ness. These were almost his last words.
The cap was adjusted, a low-toned query,
"Are you ready?" and an equally low
toned response, "Yes, good-by," and the
trap was sprung.
Holmes' neck was not broken, and there
were a few convulsive twitches of the
limbs that continued for about ten min
utes. "But he suffered none after the
drop," said Dr. Scott, the prison physi
cian.
The trap was sprung precisely at ]0:12)Â£,
and fifteen minutes later Holmes was pro
nounced dead, though the body was not
cut down until 10:45. When ii was laid
out on the stretcher occurred the only in
cident approaching the revolting in con
nection with the affair.
The knot bad become jammed and the
efforts of the doctors failed to loosen it as
they attempted to remove the noose from
about the neck. The head was twisted
about from side to side in the attempt, and
finally it was decided to cut the rope.
Superintendent Perkins objected, however,
and the knot was undone after several
minutes of trying work.
After the body had been viewed by the
physicians and the manner of death dt
termined the stretcher on whicn it lay was
wheeled out of the corridor into the jail
yard. Hero it was placed in an ordinary
cheap pine coffin, wide enough and deep
enough to have held two men of Holmes'
size. The coffin was put aboard an under
taker's wagon and conveyed to the Roman
Catholic Cemetery of the Holy Cross.
The only persons at the cemetery were
the undertaker and his assistant, two
grave-diggers, two watchmen and a couple
of newspaper men. The little company
acted as pallbearers, and carried the coffin
to the receiving vault. The last act in tne
receiving vault was performed at Holmes'
express command.
The lid of the coffin was taken off and
the body was lifted out and laid on the
ground. Then the bottom of tbe coffin
was filled with cement. The body was
then replaced in the coffin and covered
with cement. It was Holmes' idea that
this cement would harden around his
body and prevent any attempt at grave
robbery. The coffin was left in the receiv
ing vault under the guard of two watch
men, who will remain on duty all night.
To-morrow afternoon the body will be in
terred in a grave in the cemetery, and it is
probable that at the time religious serv
ices will be conducted by Father Dailey.
Holmes made no will and left no con
fession. This is according to Mr. Rotan.
He says he knows Holmes made no will,
and, while the murderer gave him this
mornine a big bundle of papers, the law
yer says that he is confident that these
papers relate only to private business
matters. A3 yet Mr. Rotan has had no
opportunity to examine them.
Mrs, Pietzel was seen after Holmes was
hanged. All she could say, between her
sobs, was that she was glad that he had
received her just deserts, but that his
death would not return to her her hus
band or her children. Mrs. Pietzel will
return to her home, at Galva, 111., next
week.
The two women referred to by Holmes
in nis confession from the scaffold were
Julia Connor of Chicago and Emily
Cigrand of Anderson, Ind.
HOLMES' MANY CRIMES.
He Had a Ready "Confession" to Clear
Himself of Ench.
Herman W. Mudgett, better known as
H. H. Holmes, was one of the most con
spicuous criminals of modern times, and
If the "murder confessions" which he has
written can only partially be believed, he
was without a peer as a bloodthirsty
demon. His recent ingenious "confes
sion," wherein he claimed to have killed
twenty-seven persons, was disproved,
partly, at least, by the appearance of sev
eral of the so-called victims: but Holmes'
object in making the "confession" was re
alized â the obtaining of a sum said to be
$7500 and which amount is said to have
been settled upon the criminal's 18-year
old son. While the "confessions" have
served to increase the sensationalism of
the case, the only capital crime for which
Holmes had to answer was the killing in
this city on September 2, 1884, of Benja
min F. Pietzel, bis fellow-conspirator.
The murder was committed in the dwell
ing, 1316 Callowhill street. Holmes' con
viction of murder in the first degree, the
affirmation by the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court of the verdict and the recent re
fusal of Governor Hastings to grant a re
spite, are so well known that a narration
oJ these facts is unnecessary.
Holmes was captured in Boston, Mass.,
in the latter part of 1894 by Owen Hans

STRUGGLE IN THE DARK
Jailer Wells Shoots Himself in

Pair.
ONE OF THE BANDITS WOUNDED
Accomplices Have a Horse ani Car*
riage Wa ting for the
Fugitives.
MADERA. Cal., May 7.â William LaT
erone and "Jack" Roberts, who were cap
tured last week at a cave near Bates, after
a stubborn fight had Been made on their
part, and surrendered only after miners
had drilled boles in the ground and were
putting in giant powder with which to
bring down upon them tons of earth and.
bowlders, have escaped from the county
jail.
Ever since these two outlaws have been
confined in the jail the officers have en
deavored to use the utmost precaution to
prevent their escape, as they were re
garded as the most reckless ana daring
criminals the jail has ever sheltered. The
flimsiness of the prison bad been proven
by the escaping of "Mormon Jimmy"
Lawson, who at last succeeded in "getting
permanent lodgings in the penitentiary
after he had made three successful breaka
for liberty.
Howard Wells, the jailer of the county,
has been locking the prisoners in one cell,
while at nights he slept in the corridor.
Richard Magoon, who is under arrest on a
charge of muriiering "Jack' McGurk, oc
cupied one of the cells, but the door from
his cell into the corridor of the jail waa
left open, as he is an old man and some
what feeble. During the day the pris
oners had dug almost entirely through tne
partition-wall which separated them from
Magoon, ana in the night, as soon as
Wells was asleep, they finished cutting
the hole in the wall and crawled through,
into Magoon's cell, where they warned the
old man to keep quiet or they would kill
him. Roberts then took one of the loose
bricks and went in to where Wells waa
sleeping and struck him over the head
wit a the brick. The jailer, though
stunned, grappled with Roberts in the
dark and attempted to overpower him.
He bent the outlaw over the bed and,
drawing his revolver, attempted to shoot
him : but it was so dark that he shot him
self through the hand and Roberts in the
arm. The pistol was knocked out of
Weils' hand, and, to prevent Roberts from
getting it, he kicKed it under the bed,
where it was found this morning.
Laverone then came to the assistance of
Roberts and the combined efforts of the
two succeeded in overpowering the jailer,
who was gradually growing weak and
faint from the loss of blood, the wound
in the hand bleeding profusely. When
the prisoners succeeded in getting the
keys from Wells they got his shotgun and
SlO in money and then unlocked the outer
door. Roberts held Wells uuder the cover
of the shotaun, and in a few moments
Laverone urove up in a buggy. Roberts
got in and the two drove off in the dark
ness.
Mike McCluskey, who lives some dis
tance from the jail, had heard the call 3
of "Wells, but he did not get to the jail
until after the prisoners had escaped. He
found Wells lying on the floor, where he
had fainted from loss of Mood. McCius
key gave tne alarm, and Welis was taken
to a hotel and placed in the cafe of a
doctor. He will be confined to his bed for
some time.
A posse was soon organized by Sheriff
Westfall, and it has been out all night and
to-day. The posse traced the buggy tracks
north from town, across the Fresno River
on to the plains, where the track was lost.
The officers say that the escapes mu3t
have had accomplices, for they are positive
that they were not in possession of any
tools with which they could have dug
through the walls of their cells. Thisyiew
is strengthened by the fact of Laverone
procuring a horse and buegy so quickly
after he eot out of the jail. The prelim
inary examination of the bandits on the
charge of robbing M. Ashley of $250 and a
gold watch had been set for to-day.
The officers believe that the prisoners
headed for the foothills, as they know the
ground well in the vicinity of Raymond.
Dispatches have been sent in all direc
tions, out so far this has resulted in noth
ing.

FRESNO. Cal,, May 7.â Deputy Sheriff
L. P. Timmins left this evening forMadera
with his three bloodhounds to take up the
chase of Outlaws Laverone and Roberts.
The Deputy Sheriff has raised the dogs
from pups, and this is the first time that
he has taken them into active service. He
has trained the hounds diligently for some
time, and expects considerable of them in
the present chase. The dogs have been
tried a number of times, and have been
very successful in following trails. They

Announces That a Settlement
Will Be Reached With

END OF THE MATABELE WAR,
Natives Give Up the Struggle Against
the Conquerors of their
Country.
LONDON. Exc, May 7.â The Telegraph
will to-morrow print a dispatch from Pre
toria, capital of the Transvaal, saying that
the wife ot John Hays Hammond, the
American member oi the Johannesburg
Reform Committee, who was sentenced to
death, has bed a long and touching inter
view with President Kruger, with whom
she pleaded the cause of her husband and
the other convicted prisoners. President
Kruger promised that he would consider
all the arguments that Mrs. Hammond
had submitted, and said he hoped the mat
ter would be settled by the end of the
week.
The outlook now seems to be most hope
ful. The prisoners, with a few exceptions,
have signed detailed statements relative to
the agitation.
The dispatch adds that JonkherrFcbaek,
chairman of the First Volksraad, has re
ceived a communication from Sir Hercules
Robinson, British High Commissioner in
South Africa, to the effect that Earl Grey,
administrator of the British^outh Africa
Company, believes the Matabele rebellion
to be broken, and had, therefore, requested
him (Sir Hercules) not to send imperial
troops to Buluwayo, and so increase the
difficulty of placing supplies there. Bir
Hercules added that the British troops,
numbering 700, would, therefore, remain
at Mafeking, on the Transvaal frontier,
pending receipt of further orders.
In the House of Commons to-day Sir
Ellis Asbmead Bartlett (Conservative)
asked if it were true, as alleged, that Cecil
Rhodes had placed himself in the hands of
the Government and offered to return to
England and meet the charges which had
been made against him of having insti
gated the raid of Dr. Jameson into the
Transvaal.
Mr. Chamberlain. Colonial Secretary, re
plied: "I have not addressed nor have 1
received from Mr. Rhodes any communi
cation whatever since he left this coun
try."
The Daily News will to-morrow say that
the solicitor of the South African Com
pany and Cecil Rhodes in London tele
graphed on Monday last to Mr. Rhodes,
who is now in Gwelo en route to Buluwayo,
informing him of the excitement caused
by tbe publication of the cipher telegrams
captured by the Boers at the time of Dr.
Jameson's raid into the Transvaal, in which
it is claimed that Mr. Rhodes and other
officials of the company were concerned in
the conspiracy to overthrow the Transvaal
Government. The solicitor added:
"In view of the altered situation in
Rhodesia the directors of the company
hesitate to accept your resignation. What
is your view?"
On Wednesday Mr. Rhodes replied:
"Let the resignation wait; we fight the
Matabeles to-morrow."
According to the Daily News the direc
tors met on Thursday and decided to de
fer their acceptance of Mr. Rhodes' resig
nation. Previous to arriving at this deci
sion the directors conferred with Mr.
Chamberlain, the Colonial Secretary, who
declined to advise them as to the course
they should pursue, but who, in view of
the debate on South African affairs that
will take place in the House of Common*
on Friday, desires to be furnished with a
definite statement by the directors of the
decision they finally arrived at.
The resignations of Messrs. Rhodes, Beit
and Harris as officers of the company were
tendered to the directors on Monday night.
HANGED FOR
MANY CRIMES,
Continued from First Page
horse-stealing and for other charges of
larceny. At that time officials of the
Fidelity Mutual Life Association of Phila
delphia were hot on Holmes' trail for de
frauding the concern out of $10,000 in con
nection with Pietzel's death, TEe latter be
ing insured for that amount, and as the
accused believed horse-stealing to be a
high crime in Texas be voluntarily con
fessed to Deputy Superintendent Hanscom
to the insurance fraud. He did not for a
moment dream that ne was then suspected
of the murder of Pietzel and he came to
Philadelphia without requisition papers.
He expressed a willingness to be tried here
on the conspiracy charge in preference to
that of horse-stealing at Fort Worth. Be
fore leaving Boston Holmes made this
"confession" to Mr. Hanscom:
"When I concluded it was time to carry
out our scheme to defraud tbe insurance
company, I secured a 'stiff' in New York
and shipped it in a trunk to Philadelphia.
I turned the check for the trunk over to
Pietzel on the Sunday nearest the Ist of
September. 1 instructed him bow.to pre
pare the body and in three hours we were
en our way to New York. Ten days after
the payment of the money I saw Pietzel
in Cincinnati. I took the three children
to that city, where the father Baw them.
Pietzel agreed to go South and he took
one child, Howard. I took tbe two eirls
to Chicago because I had business there.
We all met again in Detroit. Pietzel took
the children and went to South America.
During all this time Mrs.Â«Pietzel knew her
husband was alive, but she did not know
he had the children. If she was aware of
that she would insist that the crooked
business be wound up right away. In
order to keep Mrs. Pietzel away from her
husband I had to tell her he was here and
there, traveling from one city to another."
This was the first of a number of alleged
admissions that Holmes subsequently
made. In fact he acquired a penchant for
making "confessions" that surprised the
authorities.
The insurance officials had good ground
for believing Holmes had murdered Piet
zel and the three children, so when the
prisoner arrived in Philadelphia he was
urged to make another "confession." And
he did so without any hesitation, but it
varied somewhat from the one made in
Boston. It graphically narrated how the
body was substituted for Pietzel iti the
Callowhill-street house and its identifica
tion by Alice Pi?tzel as that of her father
a week afterward. Holmes also related
how the money was received from the in
surance company and its subsequent di
vision between Mrs. Peitzel, Jephtha D.
Howe, the St. Louis lawyer, and himself.
It was in this "confession" that Holmes
accused Howe of receiving $2500 for his
share in the transaction.
Howe was indicted for conspiracy, but
recently the case against him was dropped.
Soon after Holmes was brought to Phil
adelphia Detective Geyer visited him in
the County Prison in relation to the find
ing of the body at 1316 Callowhill streetlon
September 4, 1894. After an hour's con
versation with the wily Holmes the de
tective emerged from the prison with a
"confession," in which the accused said
the body was not that of Pietzel. but was
one substituted to defraud the insurance
company.
A week later Holmes honored Geyer
with another "confession." "Mr. Geyer,"
he said, "that story I told you about the
substituted body is not true. It is the
body of Benjamin F. Pietzel, but I did not
murder him or his children. On Sunday
morning, September 2, I found Pietzel
dead in the third story of the Callowhill
street house. 1 found a note in a bottle,
telling me that he was tired of life and
had finally decided to commit suicide. He
requested me to look after tbe insurance
money and take care of his wife and
family. I then fixed up the body in the
position it was found. These children
you speak of are all right. They are with
Minnie Williams in London. I gave
Howard to Minnie Williams in Detroit
and I sent Alice and Nellie to her from
Toronto. They met Miss Williams in
Niagara Falls, and sailed for Europe from
New York."
Between this time and his trial for con
spiracy to defraud the insurance com
pany, to which he pleaded guilty, Holmes
made many other "confessions," but they
differed very little from those already
given. Each time he pretended to tell the
truth, but he suddenly avoided doing so.
Nobody believed what Holmes said about
Pietzel, and he would not say anything
about ths children, except that they were
ail right.
In his many interviews with District At
torney Graham, Holmes persisted that the
three missing Pietzel children were with
Minnie Williams in London. He even per
suaded Mr. Graham to have an advertise
ment in the shape of a cipher puzzle in
serted in a New York paper for the pur
pose of bringing Minnie Williams and the
three little Pietzels back from Europe.
The District Attorney placed little faith in
what Holmes had told him, but the "ad"
was published as a eort of last and hope
less effort. When the bodies of Nellie and
Alice Pietzel were unearthed in Toronto,
Holmes denied having killed them. When
Howard's charred remains were located in
a superannuated stove in Irvington, Ind.,
Holmes calmly denied any knowledge of
the lad's death. When the murders of
Minnie Williams and her sister were dis
covered, Holmes said Minnie killed Nanny
in a jealous frenzy and he buried the body
in Lake Michigan. He vigorously denied
having put Minnie to death so as to secure
her property. The disappearance of Emily
Cygrand was traced to Holmes, but the
criminal said he knew nothing of the
girl's fate. The partially consumed bones
that were found in the Chicago "castle"
are known to be those of some of Holmes'
victims. About the last time that Holmes
was taken to the District Attorney's office
to "confess," Mr. Graham lost patience
with him. Holmes gave a repetition of
his picturesque falsehoods. He actually
gave the District Attorney a veritable
"jolly" about the Peitzel family and Min
nie Williams being still alive. The scene
that ensued was extremely dramatic. Mr.
Graham said:
"Holmes, you are an infernal, lying mur
derer. I will hang you in Philadelphia for
the murder of Benjamin Pietzel."
Holmes' nerve was still with him and he
said: "I defy you. You have no evidence
to prove me guilty."
Mr. Graham looked with disgust and de
termination at Holmes and said: '"You
will surely hang in Philadelphia for mur-
I dering Benjamin Pietze!."
The trial and conviction followed. The
District Attorney endeavored to prove
during the trial through Detective Geyer,
that Holmes also killed tbe Pietzel chil
dren, but Judge Arnold, before whom the
case was tried, declared this to be irrele
vant. Geyer had unearthed the murder ot
the children after a prolonged investiga
tion, and the commonwealth was prepared
to prove that Holmes also committed
these crimes.
Holmes embraced the Catholic faith
when it became evident to him that he
must bans, and Rev. Fasher Dailey min
istered to his spiritual wants. Through
out his trial and subsequent imprison
ment Holmes maintained a nonchalauce
that was remarkable.
INDIAN POLIGAMISTS.
Oklahoma Courts J-.rperience Difficulty
in Enforcing the Law.
OKLAHOMA CITY, 0. T., May 7.â The
Oklahoma courts have struck a puzzler in
the Indian custom relating to plural mar
riaees. The law of Oklahoma is very severe
on polygamists, and Indians on reserva
tions are not exempt from its operation.
The Kickapoos t aye an average of five
Bquaws each. The Cheyennes and Arapa
hoes are nearly all polygamists. as are the
Kiowas and Apaches, Comanches and
Wichitas.
It is stated that the courts have decided
to take action in the matter at once unless
polygamous practices cease. Captain
Woodson of Anadarnaka agency has issued
orders commanding Indians of his agency
having several wives to at once decide on
the wife wanted and give up the others,
and no little uneasiness has resulted in all
the polygamous tribes, as it is claimed by
the Indians that one squaw cannot raise
corn to snpport an ex-warrior in becoming
dignity. 6

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 8, 1836.
KILLED BY
HIGHWAYMEN,
Awful Tragedy on the
Lighted Streets of
Chicago.
A MERCHANT MURDERED
The Armed Robbers Attempt to
Plunder His Dry-Goods
Store.
CASHIER PAINFULLY WOUNDED
A Panic Ensues and the H'ghwaymen
Use Their Weapons Freely Before
Making Their Escape.
CHICAGO, 111., May 7.â At 9 o'clock
to-night, while the streets were crowded,
George J. Marshall, proprietor of a large
dry-goods store at 376 to 382 West Madi
son street, was shot and instantly killed
in front of his place of business while pur
suing three highwaymen who had just at
tempted to rob the store. His cashier had
Hist been shot through the hand while
behind her desk. A large number of shots
were fired on the streets and two persons
passing were seriously injured. It was
the most daring attempt at holding up a
cashier yet attempted in Chicago.
The wounded were: Miss Mattie Gar
retson, shot in the hand; Miss Kittie
Hynes, shot through both legs while pass
ing the scene on a cable-car; A. 8. Bagg,
shot in right leg while trying to head off
one of the robbers.
Shortly before 9 o'clock a man appar
ently about 50 years old entered the store
of George J. Marshall and asked what
time the store would close. On being in
formed that 9 o'clock was the closing hour
he departed. Promptly at 9 o'clock the
man returned with two companions. Two'
of the men came inside of the store, while
the third stood guard at the door. Each
man was armed with two revolvers. The
two men who went into the store immedi
ately approached Miss Garretson at the
cashier's desk and leveling their revolvers
at her, ordered her to open the cash
drawer. The young lady refused and clos
ing the drawer, turned the combination.
One of the robbers shot her in the hand,
but not quick enough to prevent the
drawer from beine locked. Mr. Marshall
being in the store at the time hurried to
the cashier's desk and the robbers ran out,
pursued by him. When on the sidewalk
the three desperadoes fired two shots each
at the proprietor, and then firing to scat
ter the crowd, started away on the run.
Marshall was hit by two balls â one in the
temple and the other in the left breast.
He died instantly.
Just at the time the tragedy occured a
West Madison cable train passed, and two
bullets went through one of the open cars.
One of them passed through both legs of
Miss Kiltie Hynes, a passenger. A gene
ral panic followed, and in the effort of the
passengers to get off and away from
danger many were badly bruised and
scratched.
Two of the highwaymen ran east on
Madison street and the other went west.
The two running east had gone about a
block when they were ordered to halt by
A. S. Bagg, who happened to be passing at
the time. Bagg was immediately shot and
fell, while the fleeing men went on their
way unmolested. Thirty minutes after
the shooting occurred the Chief of Police
personally appeared at the place of the
murder with a large force of detectives.
He has descriptions of the men from over
a dozen witnesses, who can positively
identify them. He believes he knows who
the robbers are and that he can capture
them.
No customers were in the Marshall store
to-night at the time of the tragedy, but a
number of girls were behind the counters.
All were badly frightened.
AMERICAN CITIZEN KILLED
By the Spanish Soldiers Under
Command of General
Luque.
The Intelligence Has Come to This
Country in a Letter to Thomas
Estrada Palma.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 7. -The fol
lowing letter from the Cuban insurgents
encampment of Maguayaras, dated April
16, has been received by Thomas Estrada
Pal ma:
"I have been operating within this seo
tion during the last two months, and I am
satisfied of the success I have attained,
although the Spaniards have given me few
opportunities to meet them.
"They boast, however, that they are
always after us, but that we avoid fight
ing, but I assure you that such is not the
case. They hardly venture out, and when
they do they are very careful to remain
within a short distance of a fortified
place.
"But if they are unwilling to meet our
soldiers, they are very active in commit
ting all sorts of outrages against the coun
try people they come across. Scarcely
any one is left alive, for they proceed on
the theory that every Cuban is a rebel, no
matter what bis attitude may have been.
"Among the atrocities lately committed
by the Spaniards I will describe the follow
ing. They are a fair sample of the worn
they are doing: The column commanded
by General Luque on April 11, while pass
ing Maguarayas, fired a bouse where Nar
ciso Lopez, an American citizen, was
breekfasting. They made him prisoner,
took him to tbe roadway, shot him and
left the corpse unburied.
"The small column commanded by Lazo,
April 14, while passing Santo Domingo,
seized eighteen peaceable citizens and shot
them aIL The official report says that
they had an encounter with Cuban forcee,
which they routed, killing them.
"A day hardly passes without atrocities
of the kind stated, and were I to attempt
to give you an account of those which
have come to my knowledge within the
last three weeks I would have to fill many
pages. But how mistaken are the Span
ish if they suppose that such misdeeds
will break the spirit of our people, for the
reverse is the invariable result. lam your
obedient servant,
"Mariano Torres, Brigadier-General."

SLAIN BY SFAX FANATICS.
Missionary Leach, His Wife and Son Are
Brutally Murdered by Natives
in Tunis.
NEW YORK, N. V.. May 7.â A special
cable dispatch to the Herald from Tunis
says: Information with regard to a hor
rible murder at Sfax has just been received
here.
It was a triple murder, Dr. Leach, an
Anglican Protestant missionary, bis wife
and his infant son being the victims. The
crime was discovered Wednesday. Dr.
Leach's little son, who was only eighteen
months old, was found in his cradle with
his throat cut.
The motive of this horrible crime ap
pears to have been vengeance, for the gold
and silver jewels of the victims have been
found.
Great consternation prevails at Sfax.
The judicial authorities have informed
the procurator of the republic, and juge
d 'instruction at Sousse, who arrived at
Sfax yesterday. Three natives have been
arrested.

WOMEN PARTIALLY WIN,
Take Their Seats in the M. E.
Conference Under Certain
Conditions.
Compromise Report of the Committee
on Eligibility Is Unanimously
Adopted.
CLEVELAND. Ohio, May B.â Bishop
Foss presided at to-day's session of the
Methodist General Conference. Dr. A. J.
Kynett presented the report of the com
mittee on eligibility, which provided for a
i compromise of the woman question. The
proposition was in substance to allow the
women delegates to keep their seats, on
the understanding that it should not es
tablish a precedent, and then to re-submit
to the annual conference during the next
four years the same constitutions! amend
ment or one similar to that, which lately
barely failed of adoption by the three
quarters vote.
The report further provides that the
action of this general conference should
without any prejudice to the rights of any
w omen delegates to any future general
conference under the constitution, as such
g eneral conference may construe or in
terpret it.
Rev. Mr. Warren of New England pre
sented a substitute for the report of the
committee on elieibtliry. Itprovided that
women duly qualified may be chosen as
lay del egates by an electoral conference,
the male members of which, without de
bate, by a majority report, declare that
women are eligible, provided that in no
case mo re than half of the delegation or
reserve delegation shall be women. The
substitute further d eclared that the con
ference deemed it "unwise under the cir
cumstances to interfere in any way with
the status of the women who have been
elected in good faith by their constltu- '
ents."
The full report was adopted by an
almost unanimous vote. The announce
ment of the vote was greeted with pro
longed applause.
READY TO BE VOTED ON,
Santa Monica Appropriation Will
Be Reported in the Senate
To-Day.
California Statesmen Will Do Their
Best to Defeat Huntington's
Forces.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 7.â The
Santa Monica appropriation will be re
ported in the Senate to-morrow. W. C.
Patterson, president of the Chamber of
Commerce of Los Angeles, referring to the
bitter fight in the Senate said to-day:
"C. P. Huntincrton has succeeded in pro
ouring from the Committee on Rivers and
Harbors in the House and the Committee
on Commerce in the Senate recommenda
tions for an appropriation for a harbor at
Santa Monica, although the people in the
vicinity, the Congressmen from that dis
trict, both Senators from California, and
eight of the most distinguished United
States engineers have recommended and
preferred San Pedro. This is a remark
able instance of the power of one wealthy
and unscrupulous man over the American
Congress.
"The people of California and of the
whole country should carefully scan each
vote when the measure is put upon its
passage. Fot the sake of the goou name
of our people, it is sincerely hoped that a
smaller number will bo found to wear
Huntington's yoke than he is disposed to
claim. T ere has in the history of this
country been no such outrageous effort than
this to subvert the will of the people, to
override justice and to plunder the United
States treasury for the benefit of a private
corporation. The people of the Pacific
Slope, irrespective of party, are thoroughly
aroused over this attempt to destroy their
commercial interests, aud to hand them
over, bound hand and foot, to the tender
mercies of a grasping monopoly. The in
dignation is acute and widespread. Our
people leel that they are about to be
greatly wronged, and there is no uncertain
sound about the earnestness and meaning
of their protest."
The adoption of the resolution by the
California Republican State Convention
condemning the Pacific railroad funding
bill is gratifying to the California Congres
sional delegation, except, perhaps, John
son. They regard this action of the State
Convention as a suitable answer to the
statement of Mr. Huntington that the
delegation in Congress did not represent
the public sentiment of their State when
they opposed the plan of the Pacific rail
road people. Senator Perkins of California
said that he thought the declaration of the
Republican State Convention against the
funding bill was a fair impression of the
sentiment of the people of California on
that subject.

LIVELY IN THE SENATE.
The Silver Question Is Dis
cussed at Some
Length.
Hill Says the Senate Has No Right to
Attack the Secretary's
Integrity.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 7.â The
resolution for investigation into the bond
sales of 1894-95-96 was taken up in the
Senate to-day, and Palmer (D.) of Illinois
addressed the members. He felt that the
animus of the resolution was to affect the
public mind with reference to the silver
question. He did not suppose that any
Senator, except perhaps the Senator from
South Dakota (Pettigrew), questioned the
integrity of the Secretary of the Treasnry.
He (Palmer) had opposed the resolution
because he believed that its purpose was
to procure material to affect unfavorably
the public mind.on the silver question.
Much of Palmer's argument was ad
dressed to the question how much the
commercial value of the silver dollar
would be affected under free and unlimited
coinage. The answer given by Cockrell
(D.) of Missouri was that the commercial
value of the gold dollar and of the silver
dollar would be equal; that the silver dol
lar would appreciate some and the gold
dollar depreciate some."
Vest asked Palmer what be meant by
an allusion in his speech to "snap "con
ventions" and was informed that it re
ferred to conventions last year in Missouri
and Illinois.
Hill (D.) of New York suggested good
humoredly that on the qnestion of snap
conventions, he might be allowed to speak
upon it as an expert. [Laughter.] In
order to avoid any snap convention in the
State of New York this year, the Democ
racy of that State proposed to have the
latest convention of all the States. Bill
then went on to discuss the bond resolu
tion, and he questioned Pettigrew as to
the authenticity of a telegram which that
Sena tor had read in his speech last Tues
day, remarking that the Treasnry Depart
ment knew nothing about it. Pettigrew's
response was that was one of the questions
to be investigated.
Hill contended that Carlisle should be
treated as courteously as Sherman and
Boutwell, while Secretaries of the Treas
ury, had been treated in like circumstances.
Addressing the Senators of his own
party, Hill said: "Democrats, be not dc
cc ived. This is a useless and unnecessary
proceeding; it is an attack on your Secre
tary of the Treasury; it is putting him to
annoyance and trouble. You are playing
into the bands of your opponents â Repub
licans and Populists. Ido not thinkÂ«it is
< a wise proceeding; Ido not think it is a
politic proceeding. It is now in the hands
I of the Senate, and I shall vote against it if
I am the only man to do so."
FIRE AT LONG BEACH,
Bucket Brigades Save the Town
From Destruction by Hard
Fighting.
Two Large Business Houses Burned
Before the Flames Are Got
Under Control.
LO3 ANGELES, Cal., May 7.âTne
beautiful suburban town of Long Beach
narrowly escaped destruction by fire this
afternoon. Pine street, the principal bnsi.
ness thorou . hfare of the town, was the
scene of wildest excitement, the whole
population joining in a tumult in its
frantic effort to Btay the progress of the
flames.
By the explosion of an oil stove m th*
second story of the Lowe building on Pine
street, containing the postoffice, a fire was
started. This was a two-and-a- halt-story
structure, made memorable as the scene of
the killing of Eliifcan, in November, 1894.
This buil ing was occupied by the grocery
firm of Amesberjr & Harmonson. A strong
wind was blowing and great masses of
sparks and burning wood were hurled
tnrou h the air to the roofs of the build
ings beyond.
It was soon apparent to the people that
it was impossible to save the building, and
that the Wllsbire block, a two-story struc
tn Â£ c ad iÂ°| nin g. was also doomed.
The citizens then organized bucket com
panies and stationed themselves along the
street north of the Lowe bulldin . and en
deavored to prevent the communication of
thenre by the sparks by throwine flour
and salt on near-by roofs and wetting the
mixture down.
At the most critical period assistance
from this city was asked for and a special
train was sent down, carrying fire engine
No. 1 and three hose carts from the east
side. Before this fire extinguisher reached
the town the conflagration was well under
control. The Wilshire is occupied by a
drugstore on the first floor and the second
Btory is occupied by Dr. Covert. The
drugstore is owned by J. L. Baton. This
block was totally destroyed. It was val
ued at |2500. The Lowe block was also
burned to the ground. It was valued at
f 250. A sudaen change of the wind en
abled the people to save the Lowe resi
dence from total destruction and that
building is only damaged to the extent of
11000.

MANHOOD!
The Most Precious Ele-
ment of Our Physical
Being-. You vdo Not
Know How to Appre-
ciate It Until You Have
Lost It. How It Can be
Regained,â
There are three stages of
lost manhood: First, the ab-
sence of manly power. Sec-
ond, loss of ambition, energy,
business and social ability.
Third, loss of memory, dull-
ness of vision, dullness of
intellect, and in the end but
one result â debility.
Lack of manhood is the
lack of the one thing that
makes life worth living. The
possessor of a vigorous man-
hood does not appreciate its
worth. When he loses it by
excesses or indiscretions he
then begins to realize what
a grand element it is; how
much his happiness â yes,
his very existence -depends
upon it.
When a man is broken
down in his vital powers as
a rule he is not the only one
who suffers Others, family,
friends; those who enjoy his
company and protection, no-
tice the depression in his
spirits, the lack of ambition,
dogged disposition, nagging,
irritable temperament. It
makes all who come in con-
tact with him unhappy.
Let the reader understand
that all this misery comes
from the loss of nerve foree â
that element which is the
well spring of all joy, of all
mental and physical pleas-
ure. It is the loss of this
nerve force that leaves the
mind and body weak, and
causes the sufferer to feel
that the best of his life has
been spent.
To replace the force and
strength of the nerves we
must use Electricityâ not
drugsâ as Electricity forms
the basis of all animal life <
It is the nerve force, the life
of the nerves, and the life of
all nervous and vital organs
increases when Electricity is
applied in mild, soothing '
currents, as it is from Dr.
Sanden's Electric Belt.
It is hard to convince some
people of the value of this i
great Electric Belt, for every "
sufferer knows too well the
great amount of fraud and
deception which is practiced
by makers of a cheap grade
of belts, and how these char-
latans impose them on the
public with the announce-
ment that they are "as good'
as Dr. Sanden's.
" *â¢ "I have read abont other electric belts," says
a correspondent, "which claim to be as good as
yours, but they don't show as many cures as
yours does." * * "~
>* "I have tried many different remedies* and
several other makes of electric belts, but re-
ceived no benefit until I used yours. It has
caused a â¢ permanent cure," says James H.
Burden, 417 Clementina st., Stockton, Cal. -
â  Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt
will positively cure all weak-
ness arising from early
habits or later excesses. If
you are weak you owe it to
yourself, to your family and
friends and those who will
look to you for a heritage of
health, to cure yourself now.

SAN JOSE, Cal., May 7.â The reign of
the Carnival Queen continued to-day in
regal splendor, with the people of her
domain- doing homage. Butterflies in the
sunshine were not a whit happier than
they, and evidently the brightness and
warmth of summer had much inspiration
for the merrymakers. All clouds had
faded from the welkin, and the hot air
was a carnival of itself. The sun was even
brighter than on the wonderful day of
Queen Lillian's triumphal entry into the
city, and with this new brightness there
â¢ was more of the dazzle and glitter of car
rival in the decorations, the streets, the
ensemble of flowery vehicles and
crowds of holiday visitors. The ladies
appeared in summery costumes, every
body displayed flowers and everybody was
out of doors. As on the flower day, busi
ness was a mere incidental matter, so the
carnival abated little.
Queen Lillian drove out in a flower-cov
ered barouche drawn by white horses that
were harnessed in white and spread over
with white netting. She wore an exquisite
gown of light silk, as did her maid? of
honor, and all reclined on skins of Polar
bears beneath white parasols. Her Ma
jesty's maids in waiting, some of the fair
est of San Jose's daughters, followed in a
four-in-hand carriage drawn by black
steeds decorated with yellow ribbons.
Their carriage was beautiful with yellow
satin and evergreens, which contrasted
effectively with the pale costumes of the
occupants. Wherever they went they re
ceived flattering recognition and fre
quently cheers for Queen Lillian.
Early in the afternoon her Majesty went
to Agricultural Park on the Alameda.
The street was even then a mass of gay peo
ple all moving out of town in the same direc
tion as the regal party. Street cars in a pro
cession rolled out cautiously and wheelmen
jostled with aristocratic fours-in-hand that
fcad to wear subdued manners in presence
of long lines of buses, family carriages
and country traps. A great crowd was fol
lowing the Queen, though it was hard to
say whether she was in the lead or in the
middle.
A nd by way of variety the United States
cavajry dropped into line and rode to tbe
polo jianie in the park.
When the game began there were fully
3000 persons in the grand stand, large
numbers of visitors from Burlingame and
San Francisco in the clubhouse and a
whole field full of people. In all about
lo.rmo or 12,000 were there. The game was
one that excited much interest, for Bur
lingame was pitted against Riverside. The
Burlingame players wore pink shirts and
blue sashes, and their competitors werp
easily distinguished by white shirts and
red and black sashes. W. McCreery, C. A.
Baldwin, W. S. Hobart and Richard M.
Tobin represented the club, while River
side had H. Maud, R. L. Bettner, G. L.
Waring and C. E. Maud to defend its col
nors. Captain A. F. Wainwright was ur

pireand J. Lawson scorer and timekeeper.
Barlingame led from the start and in a
few minntes had the ball between the
goal-posts. In the second period it was
plain that the southerners were not in the
fight, although they battled bravely and
took the ball many a time near their goal,
only to be whipped away, however, by a
skillful Burlingame player, whose superior
pony led the rest. Dick Tobin and Walter
Hobart distinguished themselves in .the
sallies and more daring work ana appeared
line a whirlwind in the eyes of the River
side men.
The play lasted nearly two hours and
ended with a score of 5 to 0 in favor of
Hurlingame. It was stated that the win
ners had the best ponies, in addition to
which advantage they were hard players.
The display of fireworks at the bicycle
park in the evening drew together several
thousand people, who witnessed as pretty
a pyrotechnic display as was ever seen in
this city.
The exhibition opened with six pots of
red light, which brilliantly illuminated
the previously dark grounds. This was
quickly followed by red, white and blue
bombs, exploded simultaneously, which
gave the heavens a decidedly patriotic
complexion. A set piece, containing the
words, "Our Garden City" in red, white
and blue, followed, after which a large
number of rockets and bombs were set off
together.
A set piece displaying a fire engine at
work and lettered "S. F. D." brought
forth much applause. Red, white and
blue fountains were then set off and Ron
covieri's band played "America" while
the pieces were burning. Another lot of
skyrockets and bombs were here ex
hibited. The American flag was displayed
as a large set piece, followed by a fountain
of red, white and blue fire.
Eighteen stands of Roman candles, each
containing seven pieces, were next shown,
after which a stand piece of a kicking
mule'was presevted. The stand pieces of
the "Carnival Queen" and "Our King"
were loudly applauded.
The carnival ball held at the pavilion
to-night was a grand success. The vast
hall was filled with the elite of the city.
The costumes of the ladies were the hand
somest ever displayed in this city on any !
occasion. Carnival Queen Lilian Rea, ac
companied by her maids of honors and
attendants, opened the ball about 10
o'clock and viewed the grand march from
her throne. The march was led by ex-
Mayor Austin and Mrs. J. H. Henry, the
wife of the director-general of the carni
val. Among the dancers were many visi
tors from various parts of the State.
KING COLE'S INVASION.
He Will Come at the Head of a
Fantastic Army.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 7.â ln sharp and
grotesque contrast to the orderly floral
parade of Wednesday will be the out
landish and lawless procession and ball of
Saturday evening. On Wednesday we
reveled in sentiment ana beauty and gave
expressions to ideals. On Saturday night,
under cover of such darkness as human
ingenuity cannot dispel, we shall drop
from the clouds and let the wholesome
animal in us run riot. That is to say, we
shall don masks and surrender to those
worthy disreputables, ifomus and King
Cole; and it hardly requires a student of
Mother Goose to know what that means.
This is passing regretfully over the great
polo came of to-day, the grand ball at the
pavilion this evening and the prospect of
achievements worth remembering as the
result of Stanford's efforts to-morrow.
And these events are just as important as
any other in the festival which Santa Clara
County is holding. They will be con
sidered more at length in other parts of
this account. The purpose of this writing
ia to bring attention to bear on the par
ticular feature of Saturday night and sug
gest an acceptance of the opportunity
which it offers.
It may be said at the beginning that the
authorities have decided to abandon their

The Dashing Triple Tandem of Mrs. Frank Ross That Carried Off the Prize in the Floral Parade
at San Jose.

control that evening to King Cole and his
incorrigibles. As is becoming in such a,
potentate this worthy, if rumor is credit
able, has every physical and spiritual en
dowment with which tradition accredits
his iaeal. With a girth naturally prodig
ious and a jolly soul to keep it shaking he
lacks nothing to secure perfection. As for
the rubicund nose that is merely a matter
of paint or industry.
The parade will be in four or more divi
sions, this uncertainty having been caused
by the jealous care with which uhe partic
ipants are guarding their secrets. Even
the central management has no idea of the
freakish things that will present them
selves. There is only one rule: everything
goes that is masked, grotesque and pictur
esque.
The first division will have a marshal
leading a company of tumblers and other
acrobats, a float carrying the band royal
atad then the wonderful Chinese dragon
with luminous insides, 600 legs, fiery eyes
of a diameter twice the height of a man
and mouth and nostrils belching forth fire,
smoke and lava. But the grandest feature
will be King Cole. His pipe, his bowl and
his fiddlers three will support his dignity,
and his chief mentor and moral support
will be the most uncanny and solemn of
little Africans, a brownie in the flesh, who
will turn thumerthets, thtand on his hade
and roll the whites of his eyes dreadfully.
Then will burst upon the view the Ara
bian Degree Klan, Lodge No. 4-11-44, 400
strong, and acknowledging no responsi
bility except to death. This grewsome
order is composed of the substantial busi
ness men of San Jose and the outlying
towns and they are organized for such en-
tertainments as this with a wise under
standing of the universal fondness for
burlesque and fun. Wnat grotesque ideas
will be developed as the result of their in
vidual ingenuity it is not given to all men
at present to know, but we may be sure
that their parade will be a succession of
screams and convulsions. Of course these
worthies will have a queen, and of course
their queen will be as ridiculous a bur
lesque of the beautiful girl and her empiri
cism who received so much honor on
Wednesday as it is possible for depraved
ingenuity to conceive. Whether or not
the queen will be * sure enough meat
queen or only a horrible man has not been
divulged. Certainly, however, her attend
ants will be ten creatures in white robes
and fearfully beautiful.
In this division will be three floats illus
trating the dreadful ordeal of administer
ing the first, second and third degrees.
And most wonderful of all will be the only
razor-back hog in this part of the world,
imported from Florida. What Dart it is to
take in the ceremonials has not been di
vulged.
Aa the troopers of the Presidio who pa
raded in Wednesday's procession made a
particularly handsome display they have
invited a cruel burlesque, for a part of the
second division will be the burro brigade,
a particular account of whose purpose and
appearance were better left to the imagina
tion.
The ttiird division will present an en
tirely different order of fun. As Friday is
Stanford day, and as the university lies
within the county, the students will re
main over Saturday and take part in the
burlesque. They have their own ideas
and are keepine them dark, and that only
whets expectation. Besides them the Na
tive Sons, the San Jose Hussars and 1500
or 2000 wheelmen will appear with all
their ingenuity exhausted to produce
bizarre effects. At least 1000 cyclers are
expected from San Francisco, and there
will likely be double that number. As all
will be in mask, and as each will be free to
design his own effects, we may expect a
marvelous result.
The procession, it may be inferred, will
be long. It will form early in the evening
at the Hotel Vendome, and will pursue
tne following course: First street to Santa
Clara, to Second, to San Antonio, to First,
to Santa Clara, and disband at the .Mer
cury office. All the leading business
houses will be closed, and the line of
march will be illuminated. Likeiy some
thing extraordinarily spectacular in the
way of illumination will be seen in the
case of King Cole's float, for it will have a
trolley to tap the wire of the electric road?.
In addition to this will be numerous
torch-bearers following alongside the pro
cession and wagons at intervals throwing
calcium-lights upon the procession. As
though all this were not sufficient, there
will be a float devoted to fireworks, and it
will be constantly in service.
After disbanding the members of the
procession and all others will proceed^to
the carnival pavilion, where the Mayor
will formally turn over the city to King
Cole, and where the king wi!l be crowned
with becoming pomp. It is likely that in
his proclamation he will issue sentence of
banishment against a number of citizens
who deem themselves worthy. After
some other business of this kind the mask
ball will be in order. Taken as a whole, it
will be the most amusinc and spectacular
burlesque ever seen this side of the Missis
sippi. W. C. Morrow.
TWO MORE DAYS OF FUN.
Athletic Contests, Bicycle Meets and
All Fools' Revel.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 7.â To-morrow is
set apart for the students of Stanford Uni
versity at the Rose Carnival, and San Jose
will be flooded by a multitude of students
such as she has never seen before. As
Stanford University is particularly noted
for its enthusiasm much of it wili be made
manifest on this occasion, and thecardinal
will be proudly carried from one end of
town to the other.
The students have been provided with a
special train, which will arrive at San Jose
at 10:10 a.m. The train will be appropri
ately decorated for the occasion. It will
be met at the depot by Roncovieri's Ameri
can Concert Band. The approach of the
students will be foretold by the playing of
college music, among which will be the
"Stanford University March." There will
not be a lack of yelling, and
Bah! Rah! Rah!
Bah! Itnh! Uah!
Kah! Rah!
Stanford!
will make itself manifest often during the
day.
In the morning an intercollegiate base
ball game between the University of Cali
fornia and Stanford will take place. This
wili be called at 10:30 o'clock at the carni
val grounds. This is the third game of the
series and the deciding game of this year's
championship, as botn universities have
already won one game each. Both teams
are in good condition, and an exciting
contest is expected. The manager of the
baseball team this year is James Waton,
and W. McLiaine '96 is captain and pitcher;
Jeffs '93 catcher; Young '97 rirst base;
Harris ' 99 second base; Taylor '98 short
stop; Sharp '99 third base; Thorn nson '97
right tield ; Freeman '99 center field ; Stans

PORTLAND'S JACK
THE STRANGLED
Detectives Capture a Man
Who Kills Women as
a Pastime.
HE IS OLD IN CRIME.
Believed to Be the Fiend Who
Murdered Outcasts in San
Francisco.
CONFESSES TO ONE CRIME-
Says He Merely Wanted to See How
His Victim Appeared When
â¢ Dead.
PORTLAND, Ob., May 7.â Detectives
Welsh and Cody last evening took into
custody John R. Cosgrove, whose arrest
may possibly establish the identity of the
thug who recently strangled several out
cast women in San Francisco.
On the night of April 28, Marie le Livie,
a woman of the town, living one door
north of Fourth and Ash streets, reported
at police headquarters that a stranger had
attempted to strangle her. Her story was
to the effect that the man entered her
apartments, inducing her to walk with him
to a room in the rear. There, without
saying a word, he threw her upon a bed,
and encircling her neck with both hands,
proceeded to choke her. The woman suc
ceeded in making sufficient noise to attract
her sister, occupying an adjoining room.
When the sister entered Marie's room,
Cosgrove relinquished the grasp on his
victim's throat and walked out of the
Dlace most unconcernedly. The woman
left a minute description of Cosgrove at
the police station, and, prior to his arrest,
the women in the Whitechapei district
have been living in terror since the attempt
upon Marie's life.
Detectives Welsh and Cody have been
working assiduously on the case until they
ran their man down. He proves co be a
most vicious and dangerous character.
He is 31 years of age and evidences an
extraordinarily depraved nature. To De
tective Cody Cosgrove last night confessed
being the man who attempted to strangle
Marie le Livie, who has already identified
him beyond a question of doubt. When
Detective Cody asked the prisoner what
his motive was for the commission of so
horrible a crime, he is alleged to have
said that he merely wanted to see how she
appeared after death.
Coserove has been a resident heie. off
and on, for some time, and was a boon
companion of the notorious Fred Love
who a few months ago broke jail in
Astoria, and who now is supposed to be
serving time in one of the Pacific Coast
penitentiaries. About three years ago
Cosgrove was arrested in Victoria, B. C,
under the name of John Thair for high-
way robbery. His mother, a resident of
San Francisco, furnished a large sum of
cash bail for his appearance, but it seemed
to be understood that Cosgrove should
forfeit his bonds, for it is claimed that the
charge against him was a convicting one.
He fled from Victoria and never revisited
that place. Since then he has been in San
Francisco the greater part oi the time.
When arrested Cosgrove had on his per
son a ticket to San Francisco. The prison
er's statement that only a morbid desire
prompted him to make an attempt upon
Marie le Livie's life impresses the detec
tives with the belief that be will prove to
be the stringier of San Francisco, and his
photograph will to-night be Bent to Chief
of Police Crowley of that City. Cosgrove's
stepfather, Charles Wilcox, is serving a
life sentence in the Folsom penitentiary
for murdering a man in San Jose.
Cosgrove waived examination in the
Municipal Court this afternoon, and in
default of bonds was committed to the
Connty Jail to await the action of the
Grand Jury.

PERJURY HIS MANIA.
Series of Strange Frauds Which Keep a
Fresno Man in Continual
Trouble.
FRESNO, Cal., May 7.â J. E. Woodward
was to-day lodged in the County Jail by
Constable Irvine of Sanger on a charge of
perjury. Woodward was apprehended in
Bakersfield. He is a strange character,
and is by many considered to be insane.
Several months ago Woodward sent a
false telegram from Fresno to his aunt,
Mrs. Downing, in Oakland, stating that
her husbar.u, who was teaching school at
Huron in tbis county, had died suddenly.
Mrs. Downing and children came to Fresno
on the first train, after having made
arrangements in Oakland for the funeral.
Mr. Downing was peacefully teaching
school and was unaware of the' sending of
the telegram.
Woodward was arrested for this offense,
and Justice Austin sent him to jail for six
months. He was released a few weeks
ago, and immediately went to two grocery
stores and ordered large supplies of gro
ceries for a boarding-nouse which he pre
tended he had started. At both places he
secured pieces of tobacco, of which he
said he was in immediate need. The gro
ceries, he said, would be paid for upon
QUEEN ALICE OF HEALDSBURG ON THE ROYAL FLOAT.
delivery. He was arrested and given a
half-hour to leave town.
Woodward next went to Selma. While
in jail here he was confined in a cell with
Professor W. A. Sanders, who is connected
with the celebrated Wootton mystery.
Sanders' home is about six miles east of
Selma.
When he entered Selma, Woodward
rushed up to Constable Martin and told
the officer he had just come in from San
ders' ranch and that Mrs. Sanders had
committed suicide. T;ie report reached
this city, and there was considerable ex
citement for several hours until it was
learned tnat there was nothing in the re
port.
Woodward next went to Sanger, where
he swore to a complaint before Justice
Cummings charging John Doe with rob
bing him of a gold watch, diamond pin
and $125 in Redding on the 12th of Janu
ary. He immediately disappeared. A
constable of Justice Cummings' court
afterward learned that on January 12
Woodward was in the County Jail serving
a sentence for sending the talse telegram.
A warrant for perjury was accordingly
issued, leading to the man's arrest in
BakerÃfield yesterday.
Many Dwelling*. Looted*
SAN JOSE, Cal.. May 7.â During the
carnival parade yesterday thieves entered
the rooms of Mr. and Mrs. E. A. Hale of
Sacramento and stole two satchels contain
ing $700 worth of jewelry. Among the
articles taken were a gold breastpin set
with emeralds and diamonds and a dia
mond scarfpiti.
Thieves had their own way in Santa
Clara yesterday during the great parade,
and by the time the populace of that sec
tion had got home about a score of resi
dences bad been ransacked and about $2000
worth of booty secured.
At the residence of K. C. Phelps, on
the corner of Market and Lafayette
streets, every trunk, bureau and chest
had been broken open. About $1000 worth
of jewelry and silverware was taken. J. M.
Clark lost a fine gold watch and jewelry
aggregating the value of $200, and Mrs.
Bonne a quantity of silverware. The
houses of J. K. Davis, C. Sturces, F. M.
Smead. S. K. Sanders, H. M. Sheldon, A.
L. Kellogg and J. M. Kimbcrlin were
looted. The robberies are supposed to
have been the work of an organized gang.
GROWTH OF SAN JOSE,
One Hundred and Sixty Cottages
Built During the Past
Year.
An Average Expenditure of $2000 a
Day for Labor and Ma*
terial.
BAN JOSE, Cal., May 7.â The Mercury
this morning published a detailed state
ment of the building operations in this
city during the year ending April 30, 1896.
It shows a healthy, normal growth, the
most noticeable feature of which is the
building up of the residence portion, where
160 neat little cottages were erected in that
time.
The total number of buildings erected
is 184, with an expenditure of $617,000.
This shows that a new building was erected
every two days in the year at an expen
diture of nearly $2000 during every work
ing day of that period. There were also
alterations, necessitating the spending of
many thousands of dollars, which are not
included in the statement. All of the cot
tages were erected for homes, and this
alone shows a rapid growth of the city.
Herrtnann'g Sons to Picnic.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 7.â The annual
session of the Grand Lodge of the Herr
mann's Sons will meet in this city next
Monday morning. About seventy-five
delegates will be in attendance. On Sun
day the Herrmann's Sons societies of San
Francisco will picnic at Agricultural Park,
and the local lodge is making extensive
arrangements for their entertainment.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 8, 1896.
HEALDSBURG'S
BANNER DAY,
Maiden Beauty Vies With
Floral Sweetness in a
Gay Parade.
FIREMEN IN THE LEAD.
Red-Shirted Exempts From San
Francisco Given the Place
of Honor.
HORRIBLES ON A SECOND RAID.
Wondrous Characters Personated by
the Jolly Maskers of King
Ccok.
HEALDSBURG. Cal., May 7.âThurs
day morning broke clear and bright, with
not a cloud in Sonoma's azure sky. Warm
and beautiful, the wind at rest, no
pleasanter day could have been chosen for
the climax of Healdsburg's Floral Carni
val.
The crowds were early astir. Red
shirted firemen from San Francisco and
other cities, many of them with beards
grizzled in long service, pointed out to
wives and daughters the beauties of the
Gem City of Old Sonoma. The town was
full of beautiful women. Where they all
came from is a question. It seemed as
though the gates of Paradise must have
opened and let out a band of seraph*. The
bright faces, beautiful toilets and spark
ling eyes, together with the flowers, greens
and gaily-colored bunting so lavishly dis
played, give one the impression that the
Garden of Eden was located in Sotoyome
Valley and has not yet been abolished.
The plaza is brilliant in blue and gold, fes
toons Deing hung across, around and
about it. Every store front is resplendent
in colors and the very atmosphere breathes
the carnival Â«pirit.
The early train from Ukiah brought the
Ukiah band and a large contingent of fair
visitors with their husbands, brothers and
sweethearts. The band marched down
the streets, rendering excellent music.
The early freight train from San Fran
cisco brought the Exempt fire engine; the
tire laddies had already come up the pre
vious nieht. Room was made in the en
gine-shed at the City Hall for the visiting
machine, and the boys proceeded to re
polish and decorate their pet.
All through the sunny morning hours
the bands occupied the grand bandstand,
and melodious strains floated over the
town. During the hours preceding the
floral parade, townspeople and vi-itors
promenaded through the streets, gayly
chatting, exchanging greetings, the
strangers pronouncing Healdsburg the
most attractive town they had ever
visited.
The window " decorations are superb.
Merchants have been vying with each
other as to who should make the most
attractive display. Banks of flowers,
I blooming roses, little ponds, fountains,
lilies and ferns make the prettiest of
them, although many are decorated with
colored bunting, and some with stuffed or
living birds.
Looking down the vista of the broad,
tree-lined avenues the first view reminds
one of a kaleidoscope, the gorgeous hues
of dresses and flowers mingling in a be
wildering manner. Above and beyond are
the green trees, flowering shrubs, backed
by cozy cottages, and in the further dis
tance are seen the stately hills which bor
der the lovely valley in which the town is
situated.
The time set for the floral parade was 11
o'clock, just after the arrival of the regu
lar train from San Francisco. A special
train from Petaluma arrived just previ
ously crowded with enthusiastic Petalu
mans, who brought with them a fine band.
Both trains were met at the depot and
their crowds escorted in triumph over
well-sprinkled streets to the town proper.
At ft very few minutes past the ap
pointed time the procession formed. It
was the most extensive and the finest dis
play ever Been in northern Bonoma County
and the crowds which packed the side
walks along the line of march and filled
the plaza testified its approval by frequent
and long-continued applause.
First came the marshal, Lon Morton,
with his aids, Frank Murphy of Santa
Rosa and Colonel H. F. Burns of the San
Francisco Exempt Fire Department. Then
came the red-shirted Exempts of San Fran
cisco, beaded by their own band. The
long lines drew by ropes the old Exempt
fire engine, rendered gorgeous by floral
decoration?. Next was the Healdsburg
Exempt fire company with its engine,
beautiful in the wealth of roses which the
"boys" had artistically placed so thickly
as to almost hide the "old machine."
The second division was headed by the
Park band of Petaluma, which preceded
Company E, N. G. C, of Santa Rosa. The
boys marched well, like old veterans, and
presented an imposing sight. The steam
boat which followed, propelled by two
horses which were Hidden inside of it, was
a beautiful float and justified the applause
which greeted it from all the onlookers.
Charley Holmes of Santa Rosa was cap
tain. The rest of the parade features were
as follow?:
Petaluma firemen, 123 strong, with en
gine, fine uniforms and everything deco
rated in a finished manner.
Petaluma Hook and Ladder Company,
their track, which was built in 1850, show
ing no evidence of its age under the beau
ful flowers with which it was decked. The
Healdsburg Hose Company formed a Dart
of this division, the members clad in natty
uniforms.
The Sotoyome band of Healdsburg was
followed by the Tournament Knights, in
brilliant accouterments. Then came
Queen Alice on her royal float. Miss
riaigh looked very beautiful in her dais,
under a silk and floral canopy, surrounded
by her maids of honor. The chariot was
bedecked with lilies, roses and other
flowers. It was drawn by four white
horses with satin harness, led by knights,
and was accompanied by knights in armor
as outriders and guards. The costumes on
this float were magnificent and were a fine
setting for the lovely faces of the owners.
A. W. Foster's big gray horses drew a
carriage in which sat a pretty girl in pink.
Harry Cumminâ¢* rode in a rig, decorated
with yellow satin a d poppies, with a fair
Sotoyome by his side.
Rev. Mr. Meiler entered a carriage which
contained Willie Cochran of San Fran
cisco and Lena Luce of Heaidsburg. It
was covered with wild flowers and moss,
and a pink silk canopy shaded the occu
pants from the sun.
The Healdsburg Lodge, Knights of
Pythias, had a striking float, representing
a tern: lt\ in w ich k sat the sages of the
order, while armored knights guarded the
rear of the room. Six horses in white
harness, driven by .Phil Stoffel, drew the
handsome vehicle.
Mrs. li. Poweil and Miss Pearl Pierce
rode under a canopy of flowers, while the
carriage resembled a bank of floral beauty.
A tandem team of handsome horses
drew Mrs. L. A. Norton and Miss Rose
Austin. The eye dwelt in admiration on
the wealth of yellow silk and satin and
the wondrous California poppies which
covered body and wheels of the carriage.
Mrs. Anita de Fitch Grant and her
handsome daughter, Miss Fitch, appeared
in a rig covered with gray moss and wild
flowers.
Mesdames Hotchkiss, Miller, Wight
man and Grove were drawn by a large sor
rel hor*e, covered like the carriage with
floral beauty.
Mrs. and Miss Rowland were seated in a
bank of mots and roses and drawn by a
handsome sorrel horse.
The Ukiah band, generous with its
mubic, preceded the Mill Creek school dis
play, which represented a camping-out
scene, with trees, flowers, tent, kettle and
cookinc rig, not forgetting the pretty
campers, of which there were a half dozen.
The Sebastopol stage, decorated finely
and loaded down with handsome toilets
and smiling faces, followed.
The "Old Oaken Bucket," composed of
flowers, with its old well and sweep, with
young ladies to operate it. was entered by
Mill Creek school district. It was a
unique design, well planned-and executed.
A magnificent float representing a gigan
tic white swan, under a canopy of green
and roses, was furnished by Mrs. Austin.
On the corners were miniature sloops,
manned by pretty boys.
The Cloverdale band headed the next
division, and was followed by the "cutest"
turnouts in the whole procession. Two
poodle dogs, owned by Mrs. Capell, drew
a little wation bearing a pretty boy, and
were followed by a neat goat cart owned
by Mrs. Favour.
A procession of horsemen and ladie3
followed, in handsome costumes, beine
from Santa Rosa, Alexander Valley,
Cloverdale and Healdsbure. The last
horses in this line were decorated with
gray niossos and flowers.
Mrs. Newlands furnished a turnout
wl.ich carried four girls â pretty ones tooâ
in white dresses, while the vehicle was
hidden with white rose 9.
The Cloverdale band sent a float which
was a wreath of calls lilies and white
roses. In the center oi an immense white
lily sat a representative of the beauty of
Cloverdale.
"Rebekah at the Well" was a float fur
nished by the Rebecca Lodge of Healds
burg. It wan excellent in design and
execution and the costumes were appro
priate. Rebekah was impersonated by
Miss Ollie Soules.
Guilford school district turned out the
whole schoolroom and teacher, all in
holiday attire and very well behaved.
Both teacher and scholars seemed Tree
from care and very happy.
Alexander Valley school vied with the
others in the beauty of its decorations.
Geyserville was represented by a hand
some float, with a double line of well
drilled boys on one side and a similar line
of little girls on the other, who went
through with their dumbbell exercises to
the music of a cabinet organ. Six deco
rated horses drew them along.
Healdsburg public school entered a float
which was a marvel of beauty.
Windsor Band headed the bicycle turn
out. Petalume Bicycle Club came up fifty
strong, while the neighboring town* and
local wheelmen made up quite a lengthy
and imposing parade. Not the least'
noticeable feature of this were the small
girls with ornamented wheels, who came
first in the line.
The parade was voted a grand affair, and
visitors unite in pronouncing it the best
ever seen in this section of the State.
The prizes of the floral parade were award
ed by Jndges E. B. Vreeland of San Fran
cisco, John Buckingham of Ukiah, George
B. Baer of the Cloverdale Reveille, R.
Powell of Healdsburg, J. W. Oates of SanU
Rosa, W. B. Haskell of Petaluma and
George H. Baxter of Sebastopol. They
were as follows:
Best decorated floatâ First prize, Mrs. R.
Austin ; second, "The Old Oaken Bucket" float,
Windsor; third, Cloverdale lily float.
For best show made by a wheelmen's club,
the Petaluma boys took the prize.
Best decorated windows and frontsâ The
Farmers' and Merchants' Bank first, H. M.
Keyes second, and H. H. Meyer third.
Interior decorationsâ Mrs. Paxton first, Gunn
& Ferguson second.
During the afternoon the Horribles
again put in their appearance, led by a
band of appalling dimensions, which
strung hideous music over its course. The
royal chariot was a construction never to
be forgotten, in which burlap sacks strug
gled for supremacy over old shingles and
baline rope. The "city dads" were well
represented by tine specimens of sheep
that looked out appealing from their
traveling prison. The city prison held
some poor unfortunates, who were
kept in bounds only by the lively club of
the guardian, who rode on the front seat.
To fill out the procession was a collection
of shapes from trampdom; and "Dante's
Inferno" in the parade excited as much at
tention, if not admiration, as the floral
pageant of the morning.
Following this very gracefully was an
other tUting tournament by the Dry Creek
and Healdsburg teams. This was excit
ing sport, and the sidewalks and streets
were so packed that the crowd had to be
continually repressed by the good-natured
marshals. The Dry Creek team, with its
scores, follow : Ed Thompson, 4; Al Dun
can, 6; Charley Cox, 7; Joe Cox, 3; Tom
Harrow, 4. The Healdsburg team and
scores: George Merchant, 5; Charles Keyes,
3; Arthur Haigh, 8; Bert Halgh, 8. Three
tilts apiece at three rings suspended from
poles, horses at full speed, were allowed
each contestant.
The concert at Truitts Theater was well
attended; in fact, every available inch of
room was taken and many strove in vain
to enter. It was by both local and San
Francisco talent, who rendered new and
excellent music to an appreciative audi
ence.
To-morrow bids fair to be another great
day. The wind is soft and balmy, only a
gentle breeze from the south, and while
some have been compelled to go away,
large numbers remain to fee the bicycle
races and attend the ball in the evening.
Bridging the San Joaquin.
FRESNO, Cal., May 7.â A force of men
have begun the work of constructing the
Valley Railroad bridge across the San
Joaquin River at a point ten miles north
of this city and two miles above Herndon.
A carload of bridge material was unloaded
at Herndon to-day. The men bepan work
on the bridge site three days ago, and so
quietly have they been about it that the
news was not received here until this
evening. It is now expected that the road
will reach Fresno some time in August, as
promised, so this" year's crops can be
shipped on a competing road.

Wrecked Manhood and Wrecked Womanhood.
There are thousands and tens of thousands unhappy homes in our land to-day where the
cause can be directly traced to the loss or partial loss of sexual power in either the man or
â¢wife. Many of those so afflicted believe their condition to be a process of nature which has to
be endured, when in fact it is a disease and CAN BE CURED. But it is a lamentable fact that
the majority of those who are in this deplorable condition, through false pride and sham
modesty, neglect and allow the disease to run on until the result is total impotency a blighted

I have a treatment for such diseases which has never in one instance failed to restore the weak

Years Old.

Turns Outlaw.
HIS CRIME IN SOUTH AFKICA.
Boldly Enters a Bank in Daylight
and Carries Away the
Gold in Sight.
PORTLAND, Or.. May 7.â Private dis
patches received here to-day from Cape
Town, South Africa, announce the impris
onment there recently of Stephen Wuer
mer, a Portland-reared young man, for
twenty-five years for attempted bank rob
bery.
Young Wuermer developed a criminal
tendency very early in his career, and at
the age of 20 years he eloped from home
with Mrs. Margaret Brandon, the wife of
a blacksmith, then living on Water street,
near Harrison. The woman was eight or
ten years his senior.
Brandon followed the eloping couple to
Silver City, Idaho, and meeting Wuermer
on the street shot him. The bullet pene
trated one of Wuermer's lungs, but the
worthless fellow recovered. Mrs. Brandon
came back to Portland with her avenging
husband, but soon they left for San Fran
cisco, since which time nothing has been
heard of them.
After Wuermer recovered he joined a
cang of Idaho outlaws, and once was ar
rested near Boise City for alleged partici
pation in a s;age robbery in which "Jack"
.Reynolds, the driver, was shot through
the arm and leg.
Although there was no doubt of the fel
low's guilt, he proved so strong an alibi
by means of perjured testimony that he
was acquitted. A year later he and one
Thomas Reynolds were arrested in Pres
cott. Ariz., for robbing an express-rider of
$600, for which they were convicted, each
being sentenced to ten years' imprison
ment.
At the expiration of two years of his
term, Wuermer was pardoned, but through
what influence has always remained a
secret. Since then he seems to have kept
under cover, and nothing further was
heard of him here until the dispatches ar
rived from Cape Town.
In the latter part of February Wuermer
alone walked into a private bank in that
city, covering half a dozen men with a
sawed-off shotgun, and helped himself to
about Â£1000 in gold.
Ho backed out of the bank still .keeping
the clerks covered in his retreat. Reach
ing the street he mounted a horse, gallop
inp from the scene as fast as the animal
could travel.
The bank clerks were so dutnfounded
by the audacity of the robber that several
minutes elapsed before they gained suffi
cient presence of mind or courage to give
an alarm. ' 'Â4 ., '..'
By that time Wuermer was out of sight,
but an hour later the robber was captured
by a body of mounted policemen. Within
a week he was tried, convicted- and sen
tenced, without the shadow of a prospect
of liberation before his term expires.

the fact that San Francisco has captured
nearly all of the Grand Court officers, thus
leaving the interior practically without a

chief ranger was empowered to appoint
district deputies in snch localities.
The time of ejections in subordinate
courts was changf-d'from the Jast to the
Jirst meeting nights in J tine and Decem

hibited at such elections.
This evening there was quite an exten

offered to the visitors. The Watsonville
City band gave a fine concert in the park,
the Fire Department gave an exhibition of
the speedy manner in which they can get
out and extinguish an imaginary confla

! Duncan, Miss I. M. Clayton, Miss J. B.
I Clayton, Miss J. B. Hopps and Miss
I Walker.
The proceedings commenced with a
committee conference, followed by reports
of the various committees belonging to the
union.
A short recess was taken, when a basket
lunch and a general social chat was held
by the members, after which the business
of the evening was resumed before a
crowded church, with praise service led
j by Robert Evans, followed by an orchestra
number led by William Fieischner and
the Knickerbocker quartet. .".....
The Rev. J. B. Orr of the Park Congre
gational Church conducted the consecra
tion service. r . . '
The routine ; business consisted of re
ports from the standing committees of the
union. That of the recording secretary,
Minnie C. Sanquist, giving the work done
during the past three months*, was as fol
lows:
The three months that have intervened
since our last convention have been busy ones.
Three regular meetings have been held. New
chairmen and new committees have been fa
miliarizing themselves with their various du
ties.
We have an enrollment of fifty-three socie
ties. Six denominations are represented in
our membership â the Baptists -with five socie
ties, Congregationelists with thirteen socie
ties, Christians with four societies, Episcopali
ans with one society, Methodists with six
societies, Presbyterians with twenty-one socie
ties and three undenominational.
Our committee work along all lines is pro
gressing. The lookout committee hope to
organize a society at Angel Island in the near
future. The Sunday morning prayer-meeting
committee reports good, healthful meetings.
The floating work is most encouraging.
During the months of February and March
seventeen seamen signed the Christian En
deavor, pledge. What individual society can
boast of a larger two months' increase in mem
bership? May God richly bless this our work
among the sailors. â¢ â -, .â¢
An appeal comes from our superintendent of
junior work for more workers. While three
societies have been organized â  within the last
three months, hosts of children. are without
leaders. Who will aid in this glorious work
and help build the church of the future?
We wish also to come into closer touch with
each other as societies, and to accomplish this
end the Golden ' Gate Union press committee
have formulated plans, whereby we may real
ize the closest fellowship. Your corresponding
secretary Is a member of this press committee,
but this does not relieve you from personal
responsibility in the matter of furnishing your
secretary with news. . ,
Our press committee want social news,
spiritual news, all kinds of news both of
cnurch and society.- â¢-â¢- - .
The good literature committee suggests that
similar committees in the - societies of the
Union send a report the latter part of each
month statintr what literature has been ;dis
tributed, to the various hospitals, jails and
other places, that the union may carry on a
systematic work in this line. If you have no
piace to send you/ papers to, send' them to
Miss Faught, 637 Market street, and she will
distribute them where most needed.
The report of the treasurer showed a
healthy financial account to the credit of
the union. Miss Hopps, on behalf of the
press committee, explained' the work of
that committee to be spreading broadcast
live Christian Endeavor and church news
throughout the City, which is divided into
six districts, each of which is in charge of
one member of the committee. .;â¢ . :
An amendment to the constitution was
adopted. - . : , - , , , â â  ,
'â¢Pastors in active service, connected
with the union, shall be considered ex
officio . members of the executive com
mittee of the Golden Gate Union."
This is one of the most important amend
ments which has been made to the consti
tution, as it admits the pastors to the
executive committee on the same standing
as the regular delegates. It is the desire
of the members by this amendment to
brine the. pastors into closer touch with
the Christian Endeavor work. â¢ â¢
An address by the Rev. R. Farrand of
the Howard Presbyterian Church on per
sonal work in winning souls to God, with
Mizpah benediction, brought the meeting
to a close. . . i

THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 8, 1896.
THE SUFFRAGISTS
MEET AT MADERA.
Big Assemblage at the
Athletic Hall Last
Night.
A FREE SILVER CAKE.
The Tribune and the Mercury
Open Their Columns to Aid
the Movement.
OPENING OF THE CAMPAIGN.
Stirring Speeches by Some of the Lead
ing Men of Madera on Woman's
Right to Vote.
MADERA, Cal., May 7.â The women
suffragists and their friends and sympa
thizers turned out in full force this even
ing and packed Athletic Hall. It was an
enthusiastic meeting from start to finish
and a success that its promoters, the mem
bers of the Equal Suffrage Club, have
every reason to be proud of. Judging
from the interest now manifested in the
movement and its exceeding popularity
with the voters of all shades of political
faith in Madera County the amendment
will carry by a large majority in this
county.
Both the Madera newspapers, the Mer
cury and the Tribune, have thrown open
their columns to the discussion and ad
vocacy of the suffrage movement and the
Equal Suffrage Club has selected two press
committees whose duty it will be to see
that none of this kindly offered space goes
a-begcing. Mrs. W. B. McElwee and Dr.
Mary Ryerson Butin will have charge of
the department in the Tribune and Mrs.
E. E. Vincent and Mrs. W. H. Finley will
supply and edit the woman's suffrage
matter for the Mercury.
At the big m.eeting in Athletic Hall this
evening the speakers and their subjects
were as follows:
Judge O. T. Redfield, "The Horoscope of
the Future Parties."
Judge W. T. Searles, "Proportionate
Representation."
Judge W. F. Fowler, "Why I am a
Suffragist."
"W. H. Larew, "The Eleventh Amend
ment."
R. L. Hargrove, "The Populists."
W. E. Wolf, "The Democrats."
W. H. Williams, "The Republicans."
F. W. Taft, "Free Silver."
Thomas Cosgrove, "The Press."
B. A. Hawkins, "The Schools."
G. W. Mordecai, "The Tariff."
Dr. F. R. Brown, "Why Am I a Suf
fragist?"
All of the speakers strongly indorsed the
suffrage movement and declared not only
their intention of voting for it, but also of
advocating the amendment with all their
powers of persuasiveness. There was
much enthusiasm, and all of the speakers
were*warmly applauded.
Mrs. Ella McConnell, the president of
the Eaual Suffrage Clnb, presided at the
meeting and made a brief speech in open
ing. She spoke of The Call's advocacy of
the cause and predicted for that paper the
gratitude and support of all thinking men
and women in California. Her remarks
were roundly applauded.
During the evening refreshments were
served by the ladies. There was a bis
toothsome equality cake that was pro
nounced of delicious flavor by those for
tunate enough to get a taste â for the size
of the cake had its limits and the crowd
was almost unlimited as to numbers.
There was also a free silver and a People's
party cake, besides other de'icacies parad
ing under political names too numerous
to enumerate. The committees in charge
of the meeting were as follows:
On hallâ Mrs. E. A. Hill, Mrs. Larew,
Mrs. Dunn.
On speakersâ Mrs. McElwee, Mrs. Boon
Dr. If. R. Butin.
On refreshmentsâ Mrs. D. B. McFaul,
Mrs. Hutchinson, Mrs. McConnell, Mrs!
Tambaugh.
Aside from these and the officers of the
Equal Suffrage Clnb the following mem
bers and th sir friends and sympathisers
were very active and did much good work
in various different directions toward
making the event the Bplendid success it
was:
Mrs. George Wren Mrs. M. >fedill
Mrs. f . M. Bryant Mrs. rr O ra Perkins
"Grandma" Buker Mrs. Mnce
Mrs. Ed Marshal Miss Mnmie Daken
Mr.=. Ciark Mrs. Elizaoeth Miller

Mrs. Joel Osborne Mrs. X. McYViUiams
Mrs. Reid Miss Hattie Grar
Mrs. Eva Hutchinson Miss Fuscia Cruz
Mrs. hayre Miss Lucy Preclado
Mrs. Julia Bearies Mrs. W. ft. Finley
This is but the opening of the woman
BUgraffe fight in Madera County. The
Equal Suffrage Club will mako a vigorous
campaign. The programme is not entire
ly mapped out yet, but a thorough and ex
haustive canvass of the entire county will
be made. Mrs. McConnell and Mrs. Fin
ley, both of whom are able and earnest,
speakers in the cause, with possibly one or
more assistants, will visit every one of the
thirty-nine schoolbouses in the county
during the coming months. They will be
accompanied by Miss Ettie Hensley, the
vocal soloist, and Miss Cora Perkins, the
elocutionist.
Other campaign speakers of the sterner
sex, of whom there are many interested in
the movement in this county, will be
pressed into the service, and big results
are confidently expected.
THE AUDITOR EXPLAINS
Brodeiick Did Not Intend to Offend the
Members of the Merchants'
Association.
The regular meeting of the board of di
rectors of the Merchants' Association was
held yesterday in the City Hall. This
was on account of an arrangement having
been made to meet with the Street Com
mittee of the Hoard of Supervisors relative
to street sweeping and sprinkling. The
following directors and members of the
association at 2 p. m. went to the
City Hall: F. W. Dohrmann, J. W. Car
many, W. C. Doane, A. Fusenot, H. D.
Keil, M. S. Kohlberg, R. F. Osborn, Joseph
Simonson, Frank A. Swain, Vanderlynn
Stow. Charles Keil us, Marshall Hale and
J. Fredericks.
Owing to a lack of quorum on the part
of the Street Committee the conference on
the new specifications was postponed un
til next Thursday, the 14th inst.
There was another reason for the meet
ing being held in the hall. The associa
tion had a bone to pick with the City Hall
Commissioners or one of them for having
asserted that the Merchants' Association's
proposed City Hall directory was an ad
vertising scheme.
President Dohrmann called attention to
the fact that City and County Attorney
Creswell had pleaded not guilty to the
charge and that Auditor Broderick was
the one who had used the objectionable
phrase.
The members of the board decided to call
upon the Auditor as a body and request an
explanation of the charge. Mr. Brod
erick acknowledged that he had made
the assertion that the plan proposed by
the Merchants' Association was an adver
tising seueme. His explanation was that
he did not claim that there was any profit
in it to, any member of the Merchants' As
sociation, "but that it advertised the effici
ency of the draftsman who made it.
President Dohrmann explained to him
that the plan originated with the board
of directors of the Merchants' Association
and that the draftsman of the associa
tion was simply the party who drew up
the plans in accordance with the wishes of
the board.
The board upon reassembling, elected
the following as regular members, which
brings the total membership up to 383
firms:
Fred R. Cook, 203 Mission street; William
Cronan, 1213 Market; A. B. Forbes & Son,
Mutual Life building; W. T. Garratt & Co. (by
11. D. Morton, president), Fremont and N'atoma;
General Electric Company (by Thomas Addi
son, District Manager), 15 First; Hinz & Landt,

Pncfcing Company (by C. H. Chase, manager),
509 Market; overman Wheel Company (by P.
H. Beraays, manager), 309 Larkin; A. J.

BUILDING TRADES CARD,
Slowly but Surely the Men Are
Getting the Upper
Hand.
An Important Fight Won Through
the Stand Taken by the Metal-
Roofers' Union.
The Building Trades Council's efforts to
unionize the City by sending out commit
tees to every job in the City is beginning
to bear fruit, and the outlook now is better
than at any time since the movement* was
started. Every day adds more union jobs
to the list and more non-union men to the
unions. The first efforts to enforce the
working-card did not meet with the most
encouraging results, the fault lying prin
cipally with the workmen's apathy and
indifference as to who they worked with.
However, the presence of large commit
tees from the council at all the unfair and
mixed jobs is having the desired effect.
Considerable annoyance has been caused
by the presence of union workmen from
the cities across the bay not being pro
vided with working-cards.
Another feature that has caused consid
erable bother to the committees even on
strictly union jobs is that the workmen
seemed to be afraid to demand the union
rate of wages and not a few were forced to
demand the standard rate by the business
agents and the committees.
Great credit is due to the Metal-roofers'
Union for the spirited stand the members
have taken. So well are they organized
that tenday there is not a non-union metal
roofer in town. The powerful argument
of money was recently brought to bear
upon several members at work in the Mis
sion. On a job on Twenty-fourth and Fol
som streets all the men were ordered out
because the contractors, Franz & Wein
hold, were not paying union wages.
The contractors were desirous of finish
ing the work, and from what can be
learned they intended to get the roof work
done and finish the rest with non-union
carpenters, lathers and plasterers. Every
iuducement was made to pet the nietaf
roofers to return, ana it is reported that an
offer was made to raise their wages from
$3 50 to$!0 a clay, but the men stood true to
their colors and refused to go back until
the job was unionized. Wednesday morn
ing the contractors were forced to yield
and it is now a fair job.
Among other reports made to the meet
ing was that there is a nine-hour non
union job on California and Polk streets,
Chandler, contractor, Charles Bradbury
owner. On Baker and Fulton a non-union
man was discharged* and a union car
penter put to work in his place. At 713
Cole street the committee was not per
mitted to enter the premises. There may
be trouble on a job on Haight street owing
to the presence of Oakland and Berkeley
workmen without working cards. Non
union painters are at work at 218 Devisadero
street at $2 50 a day. Union carpenters
are at work on the construction of a
church on Oak and Baker streets for less
than union wages.
A BENEFICIARY FUND.
The Committee Recommends the
Unions to Establish a Fund for
Those In Distress.
At a meeting of the Building Trade?
Council last evening the organizing com
mittee reported that the tile-setters will
form a union within a week and send del
egates to the council. The committee on
resolutions presented the following self
explanatory resolutions:
Whereas, The time has come when It is next
to impossible to hold unions together on prin
ciple alone during dull times we must add
some beneficiary features to our organizations
if we expect to hold them toeether strong
enough to get any benefit therefrom. We
must give a small part of what we gain to the
cause that gives us so many benefi's. There
fore, be it
Resolved, That we, the committee, recommend
the following amendments to the constitution:
Section I. Article Iâ All members of unions con
nected with Building TrÂ«fles Council must \>av
2Vi cents each lor each and every day they work,
thp men to pay to the secretary of their labor
unions weekly the amount specified, which Is to
bo held In trust by the local union as a special
fund to relieve the distress of members callea off
on strike and those who for a long lime have been
unable to find work.
Article 11â Married me a shall be paid In the
sum of $5 per week. Single men to be paid In the
sum Of sf3 1.0 pfÂ»r wek.
Article lllâ This fund shall be subject to the
call of the Building Trade* council as It may re
quire for the purpose str.ted in sections 1 and 4
Article I Vâ No out-of-wor < fund shall be drawn
until six months' after this law has b<-en ratified
unless the to:al fund shall have reached thf> sum
ot Â¥2500. The strike fund is to be paid as soon ns
a member Is callfM off a joh on strike. No out-of
work benefit shall be paid until two weeks after a
mtmber Is out of employment.
The resolution and amendments were
indorsed by the council and referred to
the atfiliated unions for further indorse'
menc.

TO WIN GOLD AND FAME.
On the Bay Yesterday the Oregon
Logged Over Sixteen
Knots.
A BONUS FOR HER BUILDERS.
To-Morrow Morning the Battle-Ship
Will Start for Santa Barbara
Channel.
The big new battle-ship Oregon had her
second day's outing on the bay yesterday
and a few more pounds of steam were reg
istered in the gauge. The twin propellers
went a little faster and the wave curled un
der the bows a little higher. Then the log
was hove and it showed a speed of fourteen
knots.
A few more turns of the propellers and
she was making fifteen knots, and finally
snew as permitted to swing down the bay
at the rate of over sixteen knots.
This brings the Oregon up to and above
the fifteen knots.and the sixteen and a quar
ter knots earns for her builders $250,000 or
$50,000 for each quarter knot in excess of
contract speed. They are quite confident
that she will go faster in clear sea water.
There was no attempt at forced draft and
the fires were only kept at a good working
heat. Even at a speed of four knots faster
than the previous day there was no jar nor
quiver felt in her huge mass. She simply
glided along, pushing the big wave ahead
of her 69 feet 5% inches of beam. The Ore
gon is a wide ship and when in motion
banks up the water in front of her, but her
terrible engine power drives her resist
lassly through all obstacles in the shape of
waves. She is a noble fabric and the most
perfect big machine ever put together.
To-day the Oregon will be given another
short bay run and to-morrow morning she
will introduce herself to the sea. She will
be accompanied by the United States
steamer Albatross and the navy-yard tug
Unadilla, these vessels to act as stake
boats during the official runs in Santa
Barbara channel.
THE OR EGON AS A. FLAGSHIP.
Will Probably Be at the Head of the
Pacific Squadron. i â 
NEW YORK, N. V., May 7.â A Herald
special from Washington says: There is a
strong probability that the battle-ship
Oregon when -put .in ' commission will be
made the flagship of the Pacific station.
The Navy - Department has been advised
that, the cruiser Baltimore, which . was
brought home from China .to relieve the
Philadelphia of this' duty, needs repairs
which cannot be completed in much less
than a year. The. Philadelphia is now be
ing docked at Mare Island, but she also
needs considerable repairs.
â¢ Rear Admiral Beardslee, it is expected,
will transfer his flag to the Oreeon, al
though his quarters are cramped. Neither
the battle-ship Massachusetts nor the bat
tie-ship Oregon is supplied with flag offi
cers' quarters. Â. > . â Â ;â  -,;
SHORT IN HIS ACCOUNTS.
Herman Hlmrh, Bookkeeper for Jacob
I'nna, Placed Under Arrest.
Herman Hirsch, bookkeeper for Jacob
Unna, 217 Front street, was booked at the
City Prison last evening on the charge of
felony embezzlement, the complaining
witness being bis employer.
Hirsch had been bookkeper for Mr.
Unna for the past two years. Hia ein
pioyer had the utmost confidence in him,
and when he was recently taken sick he
went at his employer's suggestion to St.
Luke's Hospital for treatment for nervous
prostration.
It was his illness that led to the discov
ery of his defalcations. While he was in
the hospital Mr. TJnna sent out a number
of bills for collection and was surprised to
find that some of them had already been
paid. There was no record in the books
of the amounts having been received,
which roused Mr. Unna's suspicions. He
employed an expert to examine Hirsch's
books and the fact was soon developed
that Hirsch had not only been collecting
bills and appropriating the money, but
had also been Belling goods, and after re
ceiving the money had reported them on
the sales book as returned by thÂ« pur
chasers.
According to Mr. Unna the total amount
of Hirsch's defalcations will reach $3000.
He kept the knowledge of his bookkeep
er's dishonesty to himself : and yesterday
morning when Hirsch left the hospital
and called at the office for a small advance
to tide him over until he could return to
work to-day, he was induced to wait for a
few minutes.
Mr. Unna notified Morse's Agency by
telephone, and a detective placed Hirsch
under arrest.

FRIDAY ..:...... MAY 8, 1896
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
All Republicans are satisfied.
The unit rule will prevail this time.
The next big step takes us to St. Louis.
After this there will be no question that
straight politics is best.
It was not only a deliberative conven
tion, but it deliberated well.
California at St. Louis will stand in the
front rank of free silver units.
â¢
Now then, whenever the Democrats are
ready the campaign will bogin.
It would be appropriate Just now for
San Jose to throw Sacramento a bouquet.
The music in the air at Sacramento has
filled the State with Republican harmony.
The more the Sacramento platform is
Btudled the more it will please the people.
Take your place in the Republican pro
cession at once and don't be left behind at
the start.
All the planks of the Sacramento plat
form dovetail together like a fine piece of
cabinet work.
Spreckels, Grant, Sheldon and Knight
not only made a delegation at large but a
large delegation.
The only free-trade agitation this year
will consist in sharing the stuffing out of
the free-traders.
Those who wisn a frolic for the rest of
the week will find it at San Jose with
tiorai trimmings.
"Consistency, where is thy jewelry?"
cried the orator, and the convention poiuts
with pride to its nominee?.
We are to have such a strong delegation
at St. Louis there will be many regrets
that its hands are partially tied.
The prophets of the Democratic predic
tion bureaus do not even make an attempt
to get honor in their own country.
California Republicanism has not only
declared for good measures, but has put
forward good men to support tnem.
Â« â¢
The Sacramento convention spoke the
voice of all California on the Pacific roads'
debts when it demanded foreclosure.
Now that the songs of the people are
heard for McKinley we may expect the
Democratic lyre to begin strumming any
day.
Hill's striking opposition to the investi
gation of the bond deals may be a grand
stand play for the Democratic nomina
tion.
If Aubrey Beardsley cannot draw his
breath any better than he could draw a
poster his pneumonia must be, very bad in
deed.
State conventions are more interesting
just now than Congress itself, for they
seem to be more alive though they do less
kicking.
The Republican State Convention may
be spoken of as monumental in compari
son with the bust the Democrats are going
to show up.
Now that it is all over the contesting
delegations that failed to get seats can
have the satisfaction of standing up with
the rest of the party.
Â»
Cleveland seems to have got the third
term and Cuban independence so mixed
in bis mind that he cannot recognize
either and passes both in silence.
The House is ready to adjourn May 18,
but it will take the Senators until that
time to talk the thing over before they
ever think of making a motion for it.
The American workineman must be pro
tected not only from the products of
foreign pauper labor, but from the compe
tition of imported foreign laborers them
selves.
As long as President Kruger has enough
diplomacy to keep out of the diplomatic
business and stick to common-sense he
will have the British on the tenterhooks
and maintain the independence of his
country.
One of the happy selections of the Sacra
mento convention was the nomination of
ex-Speaker Lynch for the office of Lien
tenant-Governor. He Is an ideal man for
the position and may be counted on to
have the support of many independents
as well as the full party vote.
In case neither Russell nor Olney suits
the Chicago convention Massachusetts
Democrats will offer William C. Endicott,
a member of Cleveland's first Cabinet,
who it seems is willing to take any kind of
medicine in order to be restored to polit
ical life again for a little while.
So many improvements are to be made
in the methods of maiketing California
fruits this year there is reason to believe
that whatever loss may have been occa
sioned by the frost will be more than coun
terbalanced by the increased profits from
ealea under the improved systems.
POLITICAL LEADERS.
The thoroughness with which the Sacra
mento convention was organized, the
promptness with which it settled all ques
tions of contested delegations, the sagac
ity with which it arranged a satisfactory
solution of all differences of opinion, the
rapidity with which it brought order out
of confusion and harmony out of discord
and the excellence with which it performed
every part of the work before it, were all
due to one controlling cause. There were
brains in the midst of thing?.
At the Sacramento convention there was
a leader. That is to say there was a ruan
present in whom all factions and all classes
of loyal Republicans had confidence.
Delegates no matter from what part of the
State they came knew they could safely
trust in him to guard the weifare of the
party because along with his untiring en
ergy, his political pagaclty and his ability
as an organizer there was no desire for
personal gain and no seeking after selfish
interest.
The element of personal leadership i 3
one of the great factors in every problem
of organized efforts among men. It is
manifest in business, in society, in
the church and in government. Po
tent everywhere, it is perbaps more
potent in politics than anywhere
else because the absence of all arti
ficial or legal restraints upon party mem
bership renders the discipline and effec
tiveness of the organization almost wholly
dependent upon the personal influence of
the leader. Our political history furnishes
a thousand illustrations of this. It is a
well-known truth that whenever the leader
is strong the party is strong, but when the
leader is weak or there is no leader, the
party is confused, weak, purposeless and
incapable of exerting its strength.
We have only to consider the examples
of Pennsylvania, held in the foremost Re
publican ranks for two generations by the
Camerons and latterly by Quay, of New
York carried for Republicanism against
the huge Democratic majority of New
York City by the leadership of Platt, of
Ohio kept on the right side of National
politics by that brilliant coterie ot leaders
which includes Sherman, Garfield and Mc-
Kinley, of lowa made the banner Repub
lican State of the Mississippi Valley by
the commanding statesmanship of Allison,
of Maine raised to power in the Union de
spite its small population by the force of
Biaine and Reed, to see the value to par
ties and to states of great leaders.
From a consideration of these examples
we can easily estimate tne benefits to ac
crue to the Republican party from the ap
pearance in the politics of the State of a
man who has all the qualities of a true
leader. Being no seeker for selfish inter
ests his influence will be antagonistic to
what is known as "boss" politics and dis
tinctly inspiring to those loyal men who
serve the party for the principles it repre
sents and the work it can do for the wel
fare of the Republic. In this way he will
draw around him first the better element
of his own party and then the better ele
ment of the whole people. There will be
confidence in him and out of that confi
dence will come the strength that assures
victory.
One of the benefits sure to result from
the new leadership will be the removal of
California from the iist of doubtful States.
It will become solidly Republican and its
politics will cease to be shifting and vacil
lating. In place of those ceaseless discords
which have destroyed the political influ
ence of the State in National affairs, we
shall have harmony, unity and power.
Strong men will be sent to Congress, not
for one or two ineffective terms, but for
periods lone enough to establish them
selves like the leaders of the Eastern
States and make the voice of California as
potent in the great council of the Nation
as is that of any State in the Union, and in
the Senate of the United States we may
have some eloquent and forceful orator to
illustrate the genius of California and ad
vocate her cause.
These are a few of the fair auguries to be
drawn from the leadership displayed at
Sacramento. The victory achieved there
is but the precursor of greater victories to
come. The people of California, irrespec
tive of party, can look to John D. Spreckels
as one destined to be in politics as great a
leader as his father has been in business.
As Claus Spreckels has been a mighty fac
tor in promoting the industries of the
State and the successful promoter of a
competing road that will break down the
monopoly of transportation, so we may ex
pect from his gifted son equal services in
another field for the advancement of Cali
fornia and the prosperity of her people.
A GOOD NOMINATION.
The nomination of ex-Speaker John C.
Lynch of San Bernardino for the vacancy
in the office of Lieutenant-Governor was
one of the best selections made
by the Sacramento convention. It will
undoubtedly receive the full approval of
the party, and prove popular in all sec
tions of the State.
The office is one wbich Mr. Lynch is
exceptionally well fitted to fill by natural
talents and qualities, by bis training and
by his experience as presiding officer of a
parliamentary body. He was not elected
Speaker of the Assembly by any fortuitous
combination of circumstances. He won
that position by the record of good work
done in political life, and the high reputa
tion he carried into the office was in
creased and strengthened by the able, im
partial and honorable manner in which
he fulfilled all its duties and responsibili
ties. He has, therefore, deserved the
party promotion now offered him, and
will undoubtedly be elected by a majority
that his friends can be proud of.
A BUSINESS PROPOSITION.
In declaring against the proposed fnnd
ing scheme of the Pacific railway com
panies the Sacramento convention not
only voiced the sentiments of the Repub
lican party, but of business men of all
parties. The question of these railways
paying their honest debts to the Govern
ment is one of business and not at all a polit
ical one. yet it is just as well to call atten
tion to the fact that the Republican party,
in its official capacity, has put itself on
record as being opposed to any lurther
dillydallying. with these companies, and
that if they pnrsist in denying to the Gov
ernment a fair and equitable settlement,
the Government should foreclose its mort
gages as it would do with any other
creditor.
It has been apparent so long that the
Pacific companies had no other idea than
to evade compliance with the letter or the
spirit of the claim of the Government upon
them that the people now want a prompt
settlement, and one that Bhall be accom
plished on business principles. There is
no disposition anywhere to deal harshly
or arbitrarily with them, but they owe a
just debt, and in a very provoking way
evince no disposition to either pay it or se
cure it upon any terms except those of
their own making. That is not the way
business men do business.
It is very true that the Pacific railways
have done great things for California and
the coast generally, but the Government
haÂ» done very much greater things for
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 8, lÂ»yt>.
them, hence the railways cannot plead
that they are objects of charity. They are
abundantly able to pay the Government's
claim?, bat it is evident that they do not
intend to pay them if they can by hook or
crook pet out of it. So, the whole question
is, Shall they be made to pay ? The Repub
lican party of California says they should
pay, and the trade, commerce and indus
tries of not only California but of the Pa
cific Coast States demand that they pay or
the Government foreclose its liens. It is
all a very simple business proposition, and
the Government has the advantage.
A STRONG DELEGATION.
The Republican party of California de
serves congratulations lor the superior
timber composing the delegation to the
National Convention. It is made up of
men of whom any State would be proud,
and it is safe to say that no delegation at
St. Louis will be stronger or more earneÃt
in advancing the interests of their own
section of the Union, while npholding the
general welfare of the Nation and the
great principles of the Republican party.
The party will expect of these delegates
that they will work in perfect harmony.
While it may be too much to hope that
California's influence at St. Louis may not
be sufficient to cause the National party to
adopt all the views which the Californians
have expressed in their platform, it is evi
dent that if no earnest and united demand
is made we may expect nothing.
It is equally clear that an earnest fieht
now will go to the credit of future en
deavor, and that victory against odds
comes only from persistent effort. One of
the greatest misfortunes under which
California suffers is the lack of Eastern
understanding concerning both our needs
and our National importance. Had the
education of the East been as thorough as
that of California we should never have
heard of Republican support of the rail
road funding bill.
The California delegates going to St.
Louis are not only thoroughly advised,
but most of them are men of influence,
able and persuasive talkers, and they will
doubtless say some things on the floor of
the convention to delegates privately that
will be long remembered.
One thing is clear. These gentlemen
are charged with a heavier and more com
plex responsibility than has ever been
taken from California to a National Con
vention. Never before has a California
party platform so fully expressed the needs
of the State, and never was a State Con
vention more in earnest in its determina
tion that its views should be weighed and
treated with respectful consideration by a
National Convention. Our delegates are
fully aware of this fact. They realize that
men of weieht, integrity and determina
tion in proportion to the gravity of their
trust were selected to represent the State,
and they may be depended on to discharge
their responsibility accordingly.
THE MERCHANTS WRONGED.
The function of a newspaper is so disf
tinct from that of a merchant that any at
tempt made by a newspaper to cover both
fields must necessarily work varions kinds
of injury. This statement is made because
of the length to which some newspapers,
in their eagerness to secure a subscription
list based on something besides merit are
going in usurping the field and injuring
the business of merchants. The singular
inconsistency of sucn a course is manifest
when it is reflected that, other things be
ing equal, the advertising space of a patter
is valuable in proportion to the extent of
the circulation, and that when a news
paper undertakes to sell articles for the
advertising of which it might receive a
generous income it is destroying the value
of its advertising columns.
But such newspapers are shrewd enough
to confine their sales of merchandise to a
limited range of articles, thus concentrat
ing the injury on the merchants dealing
in such articles and still retaining the
value of their advertising space for dealers
in other articles. It is evident that the
merchants who advertise under such cir
cumstances are thoughtlessly aiding the
publisher in injuring merchants in other
lines of business. A thorough organiza
tion by merchants would render effective
a demand that this incursion of newspa
pers into the field of the merchants will
not be permitted. However different may
be the lines of business which merchants
pursue they have a common interest, and
as a measure of self-protection they should
guard it. While a "coupon" newspaper
may be to-day selling a sewing-machine,
to-morrow it may be launching pianos,
clothing or anything else.
This is the aspect of the case from the
merchants' point of view. Taking the side
of the publisher it is evident that any
resort to "coupons" and lotteries in order
to inflate the circulation is not only a con
fession that the desired circulation cannot
be secured by legitimate means, but is a
direct violation of the faith upon which
â  space is offered to advertisers. More than
that advertisers abould (aa the more in
telligent of them do) reflect that advertis
ing space in a paper with an inflated and
artificial circulation has a wholly indeter
minate value. People who subscribe to a
paper, not for what it publishes, but for
the "coupons" which it contains or in the
hope of winning a prize in a lottery which
it runs, cannot be expected to have that
respect and affection for it that they would
have for a paper which they have selected
for its intrinsic merits, and cannot be
expected to give it close reading; nor,
for that matter, can it be assumed that a
majority of the readers lured by these
cheap Laits are tne most valuable addi
tions to the subscription list from the ad
vertiser's point of view. An advertiser in
such a paper as The Call, which resorts
to no such cheap devices, knows that the
paper is taken solely on its merits, and
that its subscription list is strong ana
healthy, not only on that account, but for
the further presumable reason that the
class of readers who take papers for the
sake of their coupons and lotteries do not
appear in its list.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
George W. Dunn, the oldest and perhaps the
most famous naturalist on the Pacific Coast,
some days ago received a letter from Baron de
Rothschild asking him to make certain unique
collections of insects from this State and the
peninsula of Lower California. Bince then
Mr. Dunn has received another letter from the
great European banker asking him to devote
his time exclusively to the collection of butter
flies.
He wants all kinds of butterflies, he says, his
idea being to make a collection ol the most
brilliant and beautiful Insects of this sort to be
found in the world. The Baron has a four
story building at Her?, which he intends to fill
with these beautiful vari-colored Insects. He
has specified the localities In California and
Lower California from which he desires the
butterflies. The Baron has learned, what is
George \V. Dunn, Who Will Catch All Kinds of Butterflies for Baron de
Rothschild.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
pretty well known in this State, that the foot
hills of the Sierras fairly swarm with all kinds
and sizes of butterflies at certain seasons of the
year. The County of Mariposa, for instance,
takes its name from the Spanish word mean
ing butterfly, on account of the enormous
numbers of these moving insects to be seen
there.
The Baron de Rothschild has written that he
especially wants all the varied kinds of butter
flies from Mariposa and from other localities
along the Sierra Range. Hes\alro desires that
Mr. Dunn collect for him In the vicinity of La
Pay the many specimens he may find there
which are valuable from a scientific stand
point. Mr. Dunn, who has been collecting
specimens in California and elsewhere on the
coast for forty-seven years, will leave for La
Paz in a day or two. He will be gone several
weeks, and when he returns will move upon
the myriads of butterflies in Mariposa.
Governor W. J. McConneli of Idaho, the new
State, known as "the gem of the mountains,"
is a familiar figure these days at the Grand
Hotel. He is an ardent silver advocate and
won't have it any othÂ»*r way than that silver is
bound to be on top.
"What I want the Government to <lo," said
Governor McConneli yesterday, "is to carry
out the laws in regard to silver money. lam
not asking for any new laws, nor for anything
unusual in any way. I want just so much sil
ver coined as was provided for in the laws
years ago, which laws yet stand unrepealed.
I have written a long address in regard to this
and have sent copies of it to McKinley, Matt
Quay, Tom Platt, Senator Allison and all over.
I do not believe I have missed a single promi
nent Congressman.
"So far as my influence goes in Idaho and
out of it, this is what I want: I want the Gov
ernment to enforce the lawâ that is all the sil
ver men need want."
Governor McConneli was for many rears a
resident of Oregon. lie was in the Legislature
there and held other prominent political posi
tions. He was a candidate for the Senate not
long ago in Idaho, and no doubt will be again.

A NEW SHIRT WAIST.
The feature of this waist is the sleeve, which
Is somewhat different from the ordinary shirt
waist sleeve, as the cuff and sleeve are seamed
and do not fasten as usual with buttons. The
sleeves are full in the bishop shape.
Any washable fabric may be employed in
making these waists, with cuffs and collar of
the same or of white.
Some of the new fabrics that are gayly flow
ered have cuffs and collars of a plain color to
match a leading color In the goods. One in
which blue predominated had cuffs and collar
of blue.
Paid or flgurpd batistes of flax color have
sometimes cuffs and collar of plain batiste.
Plain batiste waists in national linen tints
have cuffs and collar of white. Others have
the cuffs and collars of the same, with tiny
lace insertions and frills of the same lace, this
being worn unstarched.

A GOOD MOVE.
Berkeley Gazette.
The San Francisco Call, which is a most ex
cellent newspaper, is not slow to observe the
signs of the times and the Justice of any cause,
consequently on Saturday last it did what the
Gazette did one month agoâ came out flat
footed in favor of women's suffrage. From a
financial point of view this is a good move for
Thb Call, but from our acquaintance with
Editor Shortridge we are convinced that he
has made his announcemeut from purely con
sciantlous motives.
He knows that an injustice has been done to
the women of this land in not giving them the
right of ballot, and he has determined to use
his influence in righting the wrong that has
so long been done the women of our land. We
hope that his example will be followed by
every paper in the State right away.

MINERAL PRODUCT OF CALIFORNIA
IN 1895.
Bulletin 8 of the California State Mining Bu
reau, J. J.Crawford, State Mineralogist, show
ing by counties the mineral productions of
California for the year 1893, has just been is
sued. It was compiled by Charles G. Yale, sta
tistician, from direct returns by producers.
The total valuation of the mineral substances
produced last year was $22,844,664 29, as com
pared with $'20,203,294 44 In 1894, an in
crease of $2,641,369 85 for the year. Of this
increase $1,411,035 80 was In gold and $302,
-458 15 in silver. The precious metals, there
fore, are accountable for $1,713,493 95 of the
total increase named.
According to Mr. Yale's figures the value of
the mineral products of the two years was di
vided as follows:

The bulletin is on the form of a large table,
so arranged that the total amount and valuo
of each substance is shown,' as well as the
amount and value produced in each county in
the State. The lower footings show how
much of each eubet&nce was mined and its
value. The side footings show the value of
the entire mineral product of each county â
gold, silver and everything else. In this way
a record is kept of the progress of the mineral
industry of the respective counties, as well as
that of the whole. The figures are made up
from direct returns from producers, except
those of gold and silver, for which the United
States Mint flgnres are accepted. In no case is
the identity of any mine or company revealed,
fo that while no private business is made
public, the table shows our entire mineral
product with a decree of accuracy far beyond
what could he attained by mere estimates.
The total value of the mineral products of
the different counties of the State during tne
years 1894 and 1895 is given on the bulletin

A NEW BROWN CHURCH,
It Is Reported That Dr. Brown
May Form an Independent
Organization.
A METHODIST OBJECTION.
Some of Dr. Goodwin's Flock Do Not
Like the Id: a of Dr. Brown
Preaching to Them.
It was said yesterday that the friends of
Dr. Brown who are still loyal to their old
pastor are looking for the right sort of a
hall and that Dr. Brown may start a new
church of his own, or rather a new congre
tion of his own.
Dr. Brown would be following some
bright examples, it may be remarked, in
setting up an independent place of preach
ing, fencing in a lone field of pastoral
labor and starting on a new career of
churchly activity unhampered L>y confes
sions of faith or books of discipline. Dr.
David Swingof Chicago and other heretics
and offenders have done that thing with
varying success.
The late pastor of the First Congrega
tional Church has not announced this pur
pose, but it is reported to be in the shap
ing process.
The invitation extended by Dr. Good
win to the unfrocked Dr. Brown to preacn
at the California-street Methodist cnurcri
next Sunday is not appreciated by ail the
members of that congregation. Not a few
are bitterly opposed to the "courtesy,"
and that opposition will probably take
shape to-day in a formal protest against
such action.
It is contended by those who differ with
Dr. Goodwin as to the propriety of such a
course that Brown has been adjudged by
a council of his peers as a stieep with very
black wool, and lurther that the Bay Con
ference, the highest body in Congregation
alism, ratined such action by stripping
him of all the functions belonging to a
pastor and a minister.
For this reason, argue those who oppose
Dr. Goodwin's invitation, Brown has no
right to preach in any Christian pulpit
until he has beÂ£n duly recognized by the
official head, which means in tbe case of
the Methodist Church the General Con
ference.
The full force of the request of Di. Brown
and family that the First Church grant
letters of withdrawal and "recommenda
tion," which was favorably passed on at
the Wednesday nigdt meeting, has juat
dawned on the opposition.
Brown, with the assistance of his able
lieutenants, Deacons Morse and Vascon
celioÃ, has secured what he could not have
obtained from the Bay Conier nee or his
former floek â an unqualified indorsement
to any Christian organization, and further
the tacit recommendation that he be taken
into the fold.
It now develops, however, that Brown
had nothing to do with the wording or
even writing of the request for letters
of dismissal. He simply told Deacon
Morse what he wanted, and that gentle
man assumed the responsibility of phras
ing the request, which reads as follows:
San Francisco, May 6, 1896.
To the First Congregational Church oj San
Francisco: We, the undersigned members of
this church desire letters of dismissal and rec
ommendation to any evangelical church to
which in the providence oi Uod we may be di
rected. Yours in the bonds of Christian fel
lowship, Charles O. Brown, Mary N. VV. Brown,
Valentine C. Brown, Vincent W. Brown.
"I would prefer that this request be not
published," said Deacon Morse Wednes
day night, "because Dr. Brown may not
quite like it. My reason for making such
a statement is justthis: Brown telephoned
me to-day that he wanted his Utter from
the church, and so I wrote the request
and signed his name, Mrs. Brown's and
their two children."
It is not thought likely that Brown will
protest against the form of request pre
sented by Mr. Morse.
The action of the trustees in determining
to sell tbe First Church is bitterly opposed
py some of "the members, thuugn ihe ma
jority seem to favor the proposition. There
are those who look with horror at the
possibility of the sacred edifice, which has
been presided over by some of the most
eminent divines in" the country â the
church which witnessed the meteoric flight
of Dr. Barrows and the peculiar rise and
fall of Dr. Brownâ becoming a place of
ribbons and laces and perchance a corner
rookery.
FISHING FOR THE SPARS.
Divers Getting the Blairmore's
Iron Yards Out of the
Bay.
Measuring the Hatchways â A Yard
stick That Would Not Stay
Down Be^ow.
The wreckers have succeeded in getting
much of tbe sunken Blairmore's gear free
from the hull, ana they are now fishing up
the spars. Three of tbe iron yards have
been recovered after a great expenditure of
labor. Often the heavy mass of metal can
not be hoisted to the surface even after
being cast clear of the wreck down in tbe
muddy deeps below. Then the diver must
again descend and feel in the darkness
among the jumble of rope and spars for
the cause.
After a patient search he may find a
chain which must be unshackled or a
portion of tne wire rigging which must be
cut.
Yesterday three divers were down on
the bottom of the bay at one time groping
around the sunken hulk like moles. One
was working in the rigging of the niizzen
mast, another was clearing away the upper
maintopsail yard for hoisting up into the
air, and the third man was measuring the
hatchways. He came up for a weight to
fasten to bis yardstick, as the little Duoy
ant piece of wood was inclined to getaway
from him and float to the surface. With
a five-pound bit of iron lashed to it he
dropped back into the bay. and the air
bubbles over him showed where he was at
work.
After the wreck is stripped the hatches,
ventilators, skylights, airports and the
many openings in the bull must be made
air and water tight. Hatch covers must
be fashioned to fit tbe coamings and sent
down and fastened iv their places. The
difficulties of such a labor are almost in
describable, but the patient and indus
trious men now at work there will succeed
and tbe luckless craft be lifted from her
muddy grave.
Jerusha Tea Tnst.
The Aunt Jerusha "tea-test," under the di
rection of the ladies of the Frances Willard
Christian Temperance Union, which will take
place at the residence of Mr?. M. A. Athern,
1011 Treat avenue, this afternoon, from 2 to 5
o'clock, bids fair to be a very unique affair. A
literary and musical programme, with Rome
very attractive feature*, has been arranged. A
cordial invitation is extended to all friends.

WINNERS OF RIBBONS.
Dogs That Captured Prizes at
the Ken Del Club's
Show.
A FOX - TERRIER BURPRIBE.
Judge Mortimer Will Leave for Seattle
aud Return to See the Oakland
Show.
Judge Mortimer completed his task of
judging the does on exhibition at the Pa
vilion yesterday, and now the winners are
happy ana the losers naturally sad.
The dogs, of course, show no signs of re
gret or happiness; thier only cry is for
home, sweet home.
During yesterday's proceedings two of
the bull terriers got into an altercation
while in the ring â a most appropriate
place to decide a dispute â and one of the
belligerents suffered the loss of an ear,
which was chewed off in the twinkling of
an eye.
The owner of the dog that suffered was
chagrined because the handler of the white
"pugilist"' that drew first blood should not
have used better judgment and kept his
charge under control.
The little fox terriers growled savagely
at each other, but there were no fights and
consequently no trouble.
The victory that J. B. Martin achieved
over Dr. W. D. Evelyn in receiving a blue
ribbon for exhibiting the best fox terrier
in the "open" dog class caused no end of
talk amone the fanciers. It will be re
membered by sportsmen that Dr. D. Eve
lyn imported some time ago Dudley
Stroller, a dog with a great pedicree and
a winner of many prizes in the East and
West. Tne fancy expected to see
Stroller retire from the ring with the
laurels of victory, but their surprise was
great when Judge Mortimer handed the
blue ribbon to the handler of Golden
Flash, a home dog. Flash was whelped
on March 15, 1895; sire, Blemton Reefer,
dam Blemton Spinaway. The judge said
after the dogs had ieft the ring that
Golden Flash was as fine a specimen of the
fox terrier as lie had ever seen, and that
he would be delighted to own him.
Among the St. Bernard men the topic of
conversation was relative to Grand
Master, whose pictures and winnings ap
peared in Saturday's Call. This grand
specimen of the St. Bernard won tirst
prize over a large field of competitors,
much to the surprise of some people who
rre supposed to know something about St.
Bernards. Judge Mortimer said there
should be no difficulty in deciding the
question of which of the dogs on exhibi
tien was entitled to the blue ribbon.
Grand Master he unhesitatingly pro
nounced a high-class dog, whose owner
need not feel the least abashed in pitting
him against the best stock in America.
The Griffons bad no competitors. Very
few people knew what class of dog they
represented. Some thought that they
were a new breed of Highland terriers,
while others pronounced them crosses be
tween the wolf hound and the French
poodle. The judge, however, said that
they were real Griffons, andjeverybody let
it go at that. They are used by French
sportsmen for all-round hunting. They
are owned by Billy Kittle of the Country
Club, who intends to shoot snipe over
them next winter.
The ladies' pets are not very numerous
this year, .bni those on exhibition are of
good quality and highly commended by
ihe judge. The judging was continued

Found Another Baby.
An abandoned baby girl a week old and in
good health und spirits reached the Receiving
Hospital after midnight this morning. It had
been left on the steps of the kindergarten at
512 Minna street, which was formerly the In
fants' Shelter. It was found by a baker who
was making hss rounds in his wagon, and who
notified Officer P. P. Riordan. The policeman
got a blanket, and, turning the patrol-wagon
into a baby carriage, sent the pretty waif to
the City Hall.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Harbor Commissioners Worried
Over Steel Beams for
the Depot.
NO MEArS OF TESTING THEM.
British Captains Will Celebrate
the Queen's Birthday With a
Regatta.
The Harbor Commissioners are a little
anxious about the steel beams that are to
be used in the new ferry depot. It appears
that no provision has been made for test
ing them, and President Colnon wants to
know what is to be done in the matter. L.
R. Mead of the Risdon Iron Works was
sent for, and yesterday he appeared before
the board. He explained that the beams
were being made by the Carnegies, and
thai they were depending upon their test.
He never expected that the Commissioners
would demand a test, and did not know
what to do in the matttr. President Col
non said that a test would most assuredly
be made before the beams would be ac
cepted, and with that the matter was
allowed to drop.
Chief Engineer Holmes presented the
plans and specifications for the new Fol
som-street wharf, and they were approved
and ordered advertised. While the new
wharf is being built the Oceanic Steam
ship Company's steamers will dock at the
new Paciric-street wharf.
Architect Swain reported that the plans
, for the ventilating of the waiting-room
and the skylights in the new ferry depot
were defective. He suggested some changes
which would interfere somewhat with the
plans of the Risdou Iron Works. Mr.
Mead said his company had no objection
to the making of the changes, and the
board accepted Mr. Swain's proposition.
The Manufacturers' Association in
dorse the stand taken by the commission
in the matter of using California stone in
the erection of the new ferry depot.
All the British ships in port are going to
celebrate me Queen's birthday on Satur
day, the 23d inst. by a big regatta at
Sausalito. Every ship in* port has one or
more crews in training and the apprentice
boys expect to have a great time of it.
Prizes have been donated by Harry Chalo
ner, John Sloan, Charles liexter, A. Law
rence, Frank Tyler, Jacob Stutz & Co., A.
McÃoyle <fc Co., Stewart Menzies, Sennett
Â«fc Co., Henry Bingham & Co., and a host
of others.
On the 16th inst. St. Andrew's Society
will celebrate at El Carupo. On that oc
casion there will also be a regatta, and five
prizes have been procured for the occasion.
The apprentice boys on the various ships
have ail entered and there are sure to be
some close finishes.
The British ship Ecclefechau arrived
from Calcutta yesterday in the smart time
of ninety-seven days. She averaged 150
miles a day throughout the entire run.
She brings almost an entire cargo of grain
sacks, whicu will enter into competition
with the article made at San Quentin.
The United States Fish Commissioners'
steamer Albatross is preparing for an
other cruise in Bering Sea. She will be
gone some time, and beds that were not
fully examined last year will be thoroughly
explored this season. The Albatross made
a pretty picture yesterday as she lay in
the stream. As she was sKetched yester
day a scow-schooner was approaching her
wub a load of coal, as was also one of the
steamer's boats. In the distance was the
monitor Comanche. and away in the dis
tance a small schooner.
T. B. O'Brien, Judge Campbell's fight
ing clerk, had a rough time of it on the
steamer Solano Inst Tuesday night. He
was crossing from Benicia to Port Costa,
and from politics drifted to the A. P. A.
He abused the organization in no
measured terms and eot a terrible mauling
in consequence. His eye was blacked, his
nose cut, his coat torn and his new silk
hat was turned into a football. O'Brien
after he got on his feet watched the flying
hat for a while and then called out, "I
don't want that hat any more. When
you're through with it cut it up into Me-
Kinley badges." He was very weary when
he reached Oakland, so he staved there all
night and came to the City about noon
yesterday.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
Zealandia is receiving a thorough over
hauling at Howard-street wharf. It is
rumored that she will be sent to Honolulu
after sui;nr, but Captain Howard says she
will be tied up. A new foremast and new
hawse holes have been put in and the
vessel has been repainted throughout.
A little steam launch used by one of the
laundries broke down in the bay yesterday
and her cargo of clean clothes got a wet
ting. Henry Peterson went to her assist
ance in the Amy and towed her to Fol
som-street wharf. An examination showed
that the steam^iaunch had lost her pro
peller.
Business has increased tasuch an ex
tent on the Mail dock that the company is
compelled to considerably widen the
structure. As things are at present all the
New York freight has to be discharged at
Lombard-street wharf for want of room at
the foot of Brannan street. The wharf
will be widened on the basin or westerly
side and by this means the company's
working sDace will be largely increased.
The Harbor Commissioners have no ob
jection to the change so long as the east
erly side of the wharf is not touched.
The well-known ship Elwell was spoken
off Point Reyes at 4 o'clock yesterday
afternoon, havinc, made that much of the
round trip to Nanaimo in fifteen days.
Should she get in this morning she will
heat the Wilna's run of sixteen days and
six hours, which is a prize ruu.
Woman's Auxiliary.
The sixteenth annual meeting of the
Woman's Auxiliary to the Board of Missions
of the Episcopal Church will open to-day in
St. Luke's Church at 11 o'clock. Bishop Nich
ols will celebrate holy communion, and Bishop
Johnaun of Los Angeles will preach.
FRANCIS WON THE SPRINT
Two Well-Known Business Men
in a Foot Race at
Sausalito.
THE PRIZE WAS A DINNER.
H. W. Riley Acknowledged Defeat at
the Haads of Wells-Fargo's
Secretary.
The friends of T. B. Francis, the athletic
secretary of Wells, Fargo & Co., are smack
ine their lips over the prospect of a swell
dinner which they expect to enjoy with
him shortly.
Mr. Francis and Henry W. Riley, the
Davis-street commission man, are very
good friends, but they differ materially as
to their respective abilities as sprinters,
and the bantering between the two led a
day or so ago to a match race at 100 yards,
the loser to dine a dozen of the victor*
friends and the spread to cost not less
than $25.
No suitable place could bo found on this
side of the bay where the race could be
run without the matter becoming a mat
ter of public comment, so the entire party
took the boat to Sausalito, and the con
test came off in the presence of an admir
ing crowd. A level stretch of road north
of the town was measured and a fine place,
currently reported to be 100 yards long,
selected. Stripped a? far as modesty would
permit the two men faced the starter, who
was a well-known business man.
John F. English acted as timer and
Charles M. Carroll of Carroll <fe Carroll as
stakeholder. It is not definitely known
whether Mr. English held a stop watch on
the race or not, but the general impression
is that if he did it must have been out of
oider as he announced llj^ seconds as the
time when the jovial secretary broke the
tape a couple of yards ahead of his oppo
nent. As both are staid business men and
not in training for such a severe strain as a
100-yards run in 11>^ seconds, it is believed
that 15 seconds must have been nearer the
correct time.
After having recovered his breath suf
ficiently to speak Mr. Kiley announced
that while he had been beaten fairly he
was not at all convinced that Francis was
the better man and asked for a return race,
which was accorded without a minute's
hesitation.
It is said that both gentlemen are train
ing covertly as much as business will per
mit and a warm race is expected the next
time they mept on the cinder path.
A CUT-RATE SPOTTER.
L,. F. Melsing Charged With Embezzle*
nient and With Not Perform
ing His Duty.
W. W. Smith, secretary of the San Fran
cisco and Oakland Passenger Association,
in the Mills building, swore to a complaint
in Judge Low's court yesterday for the ar
rest of L. F. Melsing on the charge of fel
ony embezzlement.
Smith said that on May 5 C. H. Duffey
went to V. P. White and through him Mel
sing was introduced to Smith. White rep
resented Melsing as a very smart fellow â
just the man to send to the cut-rate offices
to discover if cut-rate tickets were being
sold.
Smith gave Melsing $200 on the under
standing that Melsiug would make a thor
6ugh investigation and furnish a written
report on the result, but he did not do so.
Melsing was arrested by Detective Whit
taker and booked at the City Prison. He
is a clerk for Jake Raver. He says he
made a verbal report to Smith on the re
sult of his investigations ad considers he
is fairly entitled to the $200 for his ser
vices.

FIGHTING FOR
DAVIS' MILLIONS
Miss Calhoun's Plucky
Contest for a For
tune.
ALVA SNOW'S CONTRACT
He Is Given the Sole Power
to Compromise the
Action.
MRS. SNELL-DAVIS' ROMANCE.
She Was Married When Fourteen
Years of Age. and Was Twice
a Widow.
When Miss Eleanor Calhoun returned
:o this City a lew days ago, fresh from the
scenes of histrionic triumphs on European
stages, gossip declared that she had come
to compromise her claim to the millions
left by Andrew J. Davis, the Montana
millionaire. This view was given color by
the fact that Aiva E. Snow, the enterpris
ing young attorney of Fresno, who lias been
active In prosecuting her suit, was seen in
the City at the same time. There were
other signs that pointed to the truth of
gossip's guess.
But Miss Calhoun declared such was not
the case, that she had nothing to com
promise, and if the story of one who claims
to be conversant with the various moves
in the contest is true thÂ«Â»re is more in her
assertion than appears on the surface.
It is over two years now since Mrs.
Snell-Davis, the self-declared widow of
Andrew J. Davis, and her two daughters,
Mrs. Alary Isabelle Morrow of Fresno and
Mrs. Laura A. Caih oun, commenced active
measures to secure recognition as heirs of
. the deceased millionaire.
Just how much such recognition would
have brought them it is difficult to say.
At the date of Davis' death his property
was generally estimated at near $7,000,000,
but that was seven years ago, and the
mining property, of which it largely con
sisted, has depreciated sadly, so the pres
ent popular estimate of about $4,000,000 is
probably about right.
The three women in question naturally
were at sea as to the proper preliminary
steps necessary to inaugurate the contest.
Jessie Morrow, the husband of one of the
contestants, was accordingly called upon
to look after the matter.
Morrow at once set out on a search for
lawyers. Not only was legal skill requisite,
but an extensive financial backing was ab
solutely necessary to successfully urge the
claim.
After a weary search Harry I. Thornton
of San Francisco agreed to take the case.
Before doing so, however, he wanted a
fair cbance of getting something out of it.
Accordingly he drew up a contract. By
the terms ol this contract Thornton was
to receive a half of 'any sum procured
from the estate, and was to have the sole
power of compromise. This Mrs. Snell-
Davis and her two daughters signed.
Thornton, with the assistance it is said of
General W. H. H. Hart, worked on the
matter for a while, but, becoming inter
ested collaterally in the Davis estate, he
voluntarily abandoned the contract.
Morrow was again in a quandary. At
this juncture his attention was attracted
to Alva E. Snow of Fresno. Mr. Snow is
a young man and was just then looming
up on the legal horizon of the raisin cen
ter. Morrow waited on Snow and the lat
ter agreed to take up the contract which
Thornton has abandoned. It was accord
ingly made out to him and henceforth
Snow had the sole power of compromise
and a one-half contingent interest in the
claims of the heirs.
The first thing, of course, was to take
the affidavits of resident witnesses. The
main witness was the contesting widow.
Her deposition is said, by those who claim
to have seen it, to read like a romance.
Mrs. Snell-Davis' maiden name was
Queen, and her Christian name is U!ma.
Her parents were prosperous farming folks
of Texas, and up to the tender age of 12
her life was the uneventful round of mud
pies and broken dolls which most children
enjoy.
At the precocious age of 12 Uima's life
romance commenced. It was at that
period that she first met Davis.
Davis was then a lad who had just
resched the downy mustache age. He
came along the country road leading by the
Queen farm ostensibly looking for employ
ment, though the old lady now asserts she
has information to the effect that his main
purpose was to get where telegraph lines
were few.
A putative son of the then youth wan
ders around the country to-aay to give
color to the assertion, but that mars the
romance.
At any rate, Ulmahad no knowledge of
Andrew's antecedents. In fact, he always j
showed a decided disinclination to speak j
of his past, and she does not even know
where he was born. Andrew being a like
ly-looking young man secured work on the
Queen farm, and he at once commenced to
lay siege to the unsophisticated heart of
the youthful Uima.
For two years the fair Ulma withstood
the buu. of the romantic Andrew, but at
the end of that time she consented. Pater
familias Queen was undoubtedly pleased
at the match, for he presented the happy
couple with a tract of land all fully
equipped for farming purposes. For
seven years they lived happily together,
and two children â Mary Isabel and
Lauraâ came to gladden their home. Then
Andrew's wandering propensities again
took possession of him and he began to
fret for pastures new.
The gold fever was then at its height,
and Davis decided he must go West. It
was in the historic year of 1849 that he de
serted his hearthstone, promising his wife
that Ehe would soon hear from him. An
drew evidently forgot to write.
Weeks grew into months, and the faith
ful wife waited and fretted. Her husband
she knew was eccentric; but when months
â¢ grew into years.an'J yet no word from An
drew, she was forced to believe he had de
serted her or was ainon b the departed. At
toe end of the secoijd year she received
word that confirmed the latter view.
As the playbills say, an interval of six
yeais elapses before the next act. The
erstwhile bride of Davis is now known as
Mrs. Williams, by virtue of a subsequent
marriage, and is installed as mistress of a
happy home at Fort Tejon, Cal.
Ihe two children, L^ura and Mary, are
still with her. One day while busy about
her household duties she looks up and ob
serves Davis coming through the gate.
"Girls," she cried to her little ones, "here
comes your father."
If the meeting was affectionate there is
nothing in the deposition to show it.
Davis expressed some polite sorrow at
lier baying filled his place so rapidly and
piie mildly renroved him for not writing
Fortunately Williams was not at home as
his part in the interview might have been
painfully embarrassing. Davis' stay was
brief. There really 3eemed little reason
why he should linger. He told his oner
wife that he was rich, and gave each of the
children a gold pugget wherewith to make
a breastpin.
This was the last time Mrs. Davis ever
saw her truant liege lord. Williams after
ward died and Mrs. Davis married a man
named Snell.
Having secured this deposition and a
few of minor importance, Snow was poe
tically at the end" of his tether. In vain
did he flourish the entrancing bait before
local capitalists.
They would have none of it. Morrow,
perceiving the inactivity of the young ad
vocate, wrote a complaining letter to Mrs.
Calhoun, who at once communicated with
Miss Eleanor, then playing in Europe.
When she received the letter she deter
mined to take the matter in her own
hands.
The London season was over and Miss
Eleanor was on her way home. The con
tests of the Davis devisees under the will
was then on in full blast, and Colonel Rob
ert Ingersoll represented an ascendent,
branch of the controversialists. When
Miss Eleanor reached New York she went
at once to the famous infidel's office and
explained her claim. The young lady was
invited to inspect all the papers he had
pertaining to the case, and he had hosts of
them. For two days Miss Calhoun rum
raaged through tha papers and found much
information of value.
In the meantime Snow had ppain got
in action. It had been suggested to him
that Detective Stilwell of San Francisco
was the man to help him out. Stilwell
was called into the case, and succeeded in
getting Sullivan cfc Sullivan to furnish the
necessary backing. With their funds
Stilwell made a trip through Texas. Mon
tana, Arizona and other places, where
Davis was said to have pone in his wander
ings. The information which he amassed
was considered of great value to the claim.
When Miss Calhoun reached Fresno she
did not come alone. In her company was
Charles F. Hanlon of this City, whom she
had procured to watch her interests. Snow
was not pleased with the entry of an inde
pendent lawyer ir the case, and at once
put his contract on file. That made things
a little gloomy for Hanlon Â«s it i 3 a little
awkward nchtine a man who has the sole
power of compromise.
Haulon also made things embarrassing
for Snow, for Sullivan & Sullivan being
startled by the vast outlay of capital re
quired to prosecute the claim had drawn
out aiid-no one cared to take up the task
of furnishing financial backing" to a house
divided against itseif. It being apparent
that no one would be a gainer by that
status of affairs an agreement was iinally
arrived at.
Then Haven & Haven found a client
who would furnisn the necessary backing.
Miss Calhoun now says she has attorneys
in all parts of the country. But as long
as a young man named Snow of Fresno
retains a certain castiron contract attor
neys may come and attorneys may go, but
he'll probably retain what is known to the
vulgar as a "lead-pipe cinch" on the legal
managership of the Calhoun claim against
the Davis estate.
DUTY ON BONES.
Farrott Company's Case Taken to the
Court of Appeals.
Gardner and Thornley, representing
Parrott <fc Co., importers of crushed bone,
filed a petition for appeal in the Court of
Appeals yesterday. The case is important
mainly for the fact that it effects Eastern
importers and involves several hundred
thousand dollars in the way of back
duties.
Some months ago Parrott & Co. im
ported a lot of crushed bor.es under the
name of crushed metal. Collector Wise
held that it was subject to duty and ac
cordingly charged the 30 per cent ad va
lorem fixed by law for manufactured bone.
An appeal was taken to the Board of
General Appraisers, the decision of Wise
being upheld. The case was then carried
to the Circuit Court and the action of the
Appraisers sustained.
Tiie claimants now apply to the Court
of Appeals.
FIVE FIREMEN FINED,
Failure to Observe a New and
Important Rule of the
Department.
Petitions Against the Whistle Nui
sanceâResignations, Promotions
and Appointments.
The Fire Commissioners, at their meet
ing yesterday afternoon, fined an engineer
and three drivers for failing and neglect
ing to take proper positions at the fire on
May 1 at Folsom and Ueale streets, it
being their duty to double with other en
gine companies at the double hydrants
placed in the mercantile districts for that
particular purpose. This is a new rule of
the department and it is considered of the
utmost importance that it should be ad
hered to.
Those fined were Tnomas Coogan, en
gineer of engine 5, three days' pay; U.
McQuade, driver of engine 5, five days'
pay; John Little, driver of engine 12,
three days' pay, and A. J. Himinelman,
driver of engine 28, three days' pay. Wil
liam Blackmore, driver of engine 24, was
also fined three days' pay for absenting
himself from his house without leave.
The resignations of Stephen SpellmarTof
engine 28, Richard Foearty of engine 10.
and William Kennedy, engineer of engine
9, were accepted. Hugh Quinn of truck 1,
who has been twenty-Lhree years in the
service, was promoted to be watchman of
Corporation "Yard No. 2. R. 8. Chapman
was appointed to truck 5, W. P. Delaney
as engineer of engine 9, V. Pa.enetti and
John Caully bosemen of engine 33, An
thony Phelan hoseman engine 28, and J.
Quinn fcoseman engine 25.
A petition was read from a number of
merchants and others asking that the fire
whistle on the electric light works, Steven
son street, should be abated during busi
ness hours, as it was a nuisance.
The Commissioners instructed the secre
tary to notify the petitioners that all the
bell-towers had been taken down owing to
t heir unsafe condition, and there were no
funds to put them back again. The
whistles bad been put up temporarily, as
the department must have some means of
notifying the extramen, more particularly
during the daytime. Should the new
charter be adopted there will be no need
for the whiotles, as it provides for a fully
paid department.
An attorney, who omitted to give his
name, asked the board to take some action
in regard to high sign boards around
vacant lots. He said while passing the
corner of Jones street and Golden Gate
avenue during the strong wind a day or
two ago the signboards were so shaken
that he expected them to fall on top of
him and he had to take to the middle of
the street. He was told that the Fire
Wardens had made a test case in the mat
ter, and Judge Seawell had decided that
they could not interfere with the existing
ordinance.
SUICIDE OF AN ENGINEER.
While Despondent Alexander Andrews
Shoots Himself in the Heart.
Despondent, almost destitute and un
able to secure employment, Alexander An
drews, an engineer, 54 years of age, com
mitted suicide by shooting himself in the
heart Wednesday at his residence at 13
Johnson avenue.
Andrews had been without a position
for several months, and through that fact
became despondent. He never threatened
suicide, however, and his rash act of last
evening was naturally a surprise to his
friends and relations. He leaves a family
of eight children.
Didn't Owe Joost.
Joseph Sheerer, who recently had a fistic en
counter with Behrend Joost in a Montgomery
street restaurant, denies the truth of the pub
lished report that he owed Joost money Mr
Sheerer also declares that Joost was the
ugitrchsor in the fight.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 8, 1896.
IS A GERMAN COUNTESS,
The Noble Lady of Schlutter
bach on a Visit to
This City.
WILL LIVE AT HOME NO MORE.
Her Interesting Story of What She
Has Seen and Intendsâ Of a
Very Old Family.
The Countess Ton Schlutterbach of
Northern Germany is among the arrivals
at the Palace. The Countess is a niece of
The Countess yon Schlutterbach of Germany, Who Is Among the Arrivals at the
Occidental.
[Sketched by a "CW artist.]
Colonel Benzoni of the United States army.
Los Angeles, and she has been in that city
for several months past.
The noble lady is tall and distinguished
ir> appearance. She came to America just
two years ago and has since been in New
I'ork, Boston, Philadelphia, Ctiicago and
other Eastern cities. She declares that
she likes America so well that she will
never again return to Germany, except to
visit her friends. Her home, she says,
shall henceforth be in this country.
The distinguished lady is a widow, she
having lost her husband some time ago.
Her grandmother was Italian, so her hair
is not of the blonde type of which one is
accustomed to think when adverting to
the ladies of Northern Germany, but is, in
fact, rather dark, while she is fair of face
and one of whom people would say was
handsome as well as engaging.
She is full of admiration for many things
she has seen.
"In everything pertaining to progress,
in inventions and taking hold ol big
things," said she, "there is no country
that is like this. Men spend millions of
dollars here in going into different enter
prises, and pursue their way as a matter
of course, when all is conservatism abroad.
Th is has been the striking thing to me.
In everything but music and painting
America transcends all the countries of
Europe. I love this country better than
my own land."
The Countess has been visiting the park,
cliff and various places of interest. She
may stay here some time. The lady comes
of a very old and renowned family.
THE UTAH BATE BATTLE,
Local Merchants Talk of Boy
cotting Some of the Mis
souri Lines.
The Traffic Association to Meet Next
Week to Do Something About
the Situation.
The Traffic Association is going to take
vigorous hold of those Utah rates that are,
and for so long have been, giving San
Francisco the worst of it and the Eastern
business world ana the Missouri lines the
best of it.
On next Wednesday the Traffic Associa
tion will hold a meeting to consider this
particular suDject. What will be done is
not definitely foreshadowed, but discus
sion will undoubtedly be followed by an
expression of some kind which will be
expected to cut a figure at the forthcoming
meeting of the Trans-Missouri Association
at Denver.
The threat is made that unless the
Trans-Missouri lines make some arrange
ment that will reopen to San Francisco the
Utah field that rightfully belongs to its
wholesale merchants, the local merchants
will institute a boycott on the Union
Pacific, the Rio Grande Wfestern and their
allies.
A club of this sort will likely be shaped
and put info the hands of the Southern
Pacific for it to use at the coming meeting,
at which it will be represented and cut a
big iignre in the deliberations, though it is
not a member of the Trans-Missouri
Association.
The Southern Pacific and the local mer
chants interested are working together on
this particular thing of common interest.
Perhaps the merchants are backing the
Traffic Association and perhaps the
Traffic Association is backing the South
ern PaÂ»ific, but at any rate they will make
a strong and concerted effort to regain the
opportunity of landing goods at Utah
bus ness points at rates which do not shut
out the San Francisco merchants and dis
criminate in favor of the East.
City Hall Directory.
City Attorney Creswell fau written to Presi
dent Uohruiann of the Merchants' Association
that he had neither stated nor intimated to
any one "that the plan proposed by the Mer
chants' Association was an advertising
scheme." He declares that the report in a
morning newspaper to that effect was incor
rect and that his only objection to the direc
tory of the Merchants' Association was that he
believed it was too complicated. The Mer
chants' Association is delighted with the pros
pect that there will soot be a directory in the
City Hall. The directors of the Merchants'
Association had no special preference for any
particular plan.
PROTECT THE SAILORS.
Decision Restricting Rights of Bomrd
ing-House Keepers.
E. T. Chamberlain, Commissioner of
Navigation, has just notified the Federal
authorities here of a decision rendered by
the United States District Court for
Southern Georgia, which affects every
sailor coming to this port.
In February of 1895 Congressman Ma
guire caused to be passed a bill regulating
Ihe rights of boarding-house Keepers, mak
ing it a misdemeanor to retain a sailor's
clothine for board. In the succeeding
montli the Southern District Court of
Georgia indicted a person for withholding
a seaman's clothing when demanded. He
was tried, convicted and fined $10. This
is the .first conviction under the Magnire
act, and means much ior tho3e who
follow the sea.
WAS DUE TO NEGLIGENCE
The Railroad Is Held Respon
sible for the Death of
Mrs. Johnson.
A Coroner's Jury Says the Fatal
Accident Was Due to Lack of
Proper Fenders.
As the resnlt of the inquest held by
Coroner Hawkins on the body of Mrs.
Georgia McVeigh Johnson, who died at
her residence, 612 Van Ness avenue, April
29, from injuries received in being run
down by a Turk-street electric car, the
Market-street Railroad Company will have
another big damage suit on its hands. The
jury impaneled returned the following
rider to its verdict:
And we farther find that it was an accident,
and we find the Railroad Company negligent
in not having proper fenders and guards on
its cars.
In all twelve witnesses were examined,
the evidence relating to the speed of the
car differing materially. One stated that
the modern juggernaut was going at least
fifteen miles an hour and another that
the speed did not exceed one-third that
rate. Motorman Finch was positive the
car was not running any faster than eight
miles an hour, and in spite of the fact that
this speed was maintained on a heavy
grade declared he had perfect control over
the vehicle.
The jury, however, did not seem to care
so much for the speed of the car as for the
lack of a proper life-saving fender. There
was not the slightest evidence to show the
presence of any such device, and the jury
returned the verdict as printed above.
Some months ago the Market-street Com
pany made a great pretense of complying
with the ordinance passed by the Super
visors, requiring that all cars be fitted with
proper fenders. "Mr. Vimng graciously
allowed one or two people to attach devices
to his cars, at their own expense, and then
invited the Supervisors to witness the tri
als. This thing was kept up for a few
weeks, and then, when Mr. Vining had
made the Supervisors believe that he really
intended to comply with the law, he im
mediately turned his attention to some
thing else. Car-fenders are expensive, and
the Market-street Company owns several
thousand cars. Mr. Vining is endeavoring
to be economical, and in that lies the cause
of many accidents and deaths.
AGREEABLE CIVIL SERVICE.
Local Federal Employes Are Pleased
at the Prospect of a Life Situation.
The Federal employes in this City are
generally pleased over the order issued by
President Cleveland on Tuesday placing
all Government officials below the rank of
Presidential nomination and Senatorial
confirmation and above the grades of
laborers and workmen under the protec
tion of the civil service Jaw. There are a
few exceptions to this sweeping order, in
cluding a few cashiers.
The revision of the rules divides the civil
service into five branchesâ Custom-house,
postoffice, departmental. Governmental,
printing and revenue service. Through
out the United States this adds 29,399 posi
tions to the classified list, increasing the
total number of positions from 55, 730 to
The positions affected here by the new
order run over 300. In the Collector's of
fice Mr. Jerome is the only man, with the
exception of the cashier, who will now be
placed on the civil service list. The other
employes are already in the civil-service
class. In the other departments of the
Federal building, including the postofflce,
the positions affected number from two to
fifteen, the Internal Revenue office fur
nishing the larger number. Nearly every
position in the Mint is now subject to the
revised civil-service law.
GREETING TO THE BISHOP,
Right Rev. Dr. Johnson Wel
comed by the Episcopal
Convention.
A RECEPTION TO DELEGATES.
The Session Adjourned After Conclud
ing the Election of the
Committees.
The Episcopal Convention, which opened
on Tuesday morning in Grace Church,
came to an end yesterday afternoon, after
satisfactorily concluding the business of
the diocese, which it had met to consider.
After morning prayer yesterday, Rev.
George Edward Walk reported for the
committee on the state of the church.
He said: "The new demarkation of the
diocese and the opportunities it affords for
active propagation of the history and
doctrine of the church in communities
where it has not yet gone, makes the
suggestion of the early appointment of
an archdeacon to assist the Bishop in such
diocesan missionary work of peculiar
force."
The report alluded enthusiastically to the
cathedral suggestion which had been con
tained in the Bishop's annual speech, and
added : "In the contemplation of all these
beginnings of larger things, the committee
feels that there is ground for profound
thankfulness."
An encouraging report of the Brother
hood of St. A.idfew was made by L. C.
McAfee, and the convention proceeded to
nominations for those standing commit
tees that are elected by vote. Rev. Dr.
Lewis and W. C. Ambroise were appointed
tellers, and Rev. R. C. Foute begged the
privilege of interrupting the voting to
make the announcement that Right Rev.
Dr. Johnson, Bishop of Los Angeles, who
had been expected in the afternoon, had
already arrived. The chair appointed Rev.
Mr. Foute and Major W. B. Hooper a com
mittee to welcome the new Bishop, and
before the conclusion of the voting these
gentlemen appeared accompanied by Dr.
Johnson. He was warmly welcomed by
Bishop Nichols, who said: "My brethren
of the clergy and laity of the convention.
It is a great pleasure and one we have all
been looking forward to that we realize at
this moment. We had been hoping to
meet the Bishop of Los Angeles at the
ferry this afternoon, but it shows what a
progressive man be is that he has trot about
six hours the start of us and for any one
to get ahead of the diocese of California is
a great feat."
Bishop Nichols concluded, by bidding
the new Bishop welcome, in the name of
the convention.
In responding to this greeting the Right
Rev. Dr. Johnson said: "I do not feel at
all a stranger. I expected this warm wel
come, for I know that you have been
trained in the same school as our brethren
in Los Angtles. 1 ' The Bishop went on to
speak of tiie warmth of heart of the mem
bers of his new see and of their.earnest
church feeling. "I come," he said, "bear
ing the warmest feeling from the brethren
who have been cut off from this diocese.
1 hope the time is not far distant when
the two dioceses will meet together in a
synod."
Rev. John Gray, who accompanied
Bishop Johnson, added a few word? testi
fying to the good feeling which prevails in
the diocese of Los Angeles toward the old
diocese of California.
Considerable time, both of the morning
and the afternoon session, was spent in
casting ballots, as many of the nominees
elected on the clerical vote did not secure
enough lay votes to be elected, and vice
versa. The following committees were
finally declared duly elected :
Board of directors of the incorporation
of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the
diocese of Californiaâ Right Rev. W. F.
Nichols, Rev. D. 0. Kelly, E. E. Wall, A.
H. Phelps, A. W. Droun, W. E. Dean, J.
A. Wright. Board of missionsâ Rev. J.
A. Emery, Rev. W. H. Moieland, Rev. E.
J. Mynafd, Rev. De Wolfe Cowie, Colonel
J. B. D. Middleton. Standing committee
â Rev. Hobart Chetwood, Rev. R. C.
Foute, Rev. Dr. Spalding, Colonel H. C.
Mendel, Major W. B. Hooper, A. W.
Droun, C. D. Haven. Rev. Dr. Ackerly
was reappointed registrar of the diocese
by the president, Right. Rev. W r . f.
Nichols.
In closing the convention the Bishop
made a Drief address, expressing satisfac
tion at the progress made and the amount
of business transacted.
A PLEASANT RECEPTION.
Bishop and Mrs. Nichols Enter-
tain at the Occidental
Hotel.
A thoroughly pleasant and informal re
ception was given by Bishop and Mrs.
Nichols yesterday evening at the Occi
dental Hotel. The visiting clergy and lay
delegates, as well as the church people
generally, had been invited to be present,
and so many responded to the invitation
tbot the large reception parlor and the ad
joining parlor only just escaped being
crowded.
The rooms had been prettily decorated
with yellow and blue bunting, as well as
with ferns and flowers. Bishop and Mrs.
Nichols received ail comers with pleasant
informality, being assisted by Mrs.
Moreland, Mrs. E. J. Lion, Mrs. D. O.
Kelly, Mrs. Emery, Mrs. Walk and Mrs.
Spalding, all wives of prominent Episco
palian clergymen in this City. The new
Bishop of Los Anpeles, Right Rev. Dr.
Johnson, was also present and most of the
visitors were presented to him.
In addition to the clerical and lay dele
gates, with their wives, most of the Episco
palian clergy from this City and round the
bay were present, and their churches were
well represented by lay visitors. The re
ception lasted from 8 till 10, and the time
was pleasantly passed in introductions and
conversation. An orchestra situated in
the corridor played a number of selec
tions, and light refreshments were handed
round from a buffet prettily arranged on
a dais under a canopy of yellow and blue
bunting.
Among the clergymen present were:
Rev. George Edward Walk, Rev. Dr.
Spalding. Rev. W. M. Reilly, Rev. Hobart

CAN PAY NO FEES.
Miss Lillian Ashley Wants Jury Money
Waived in Her Case.
Lillian Ashley, who is suing E. J. Bald
win for $75,000 damages for seduction, ap
peared in court when Judge Slack called
the case yesterday morning and asked that
the court remit the fees in the case.
She filed a long affidavit, in which she
pleaded that she was dependent upon her
own exertions for her own support, and
that she also had to support the child
which she wishes Baldwin to father. She
says she works from 9 o'clock in the morn
ing until 6 in the evening at hair-dressing
and manicuring in Pasadena. She owns a
little cottage, which is mortgaged for all it
is worth, and lives in it without paying
rent, but she declares that she cannot pos
sibly raise sufficient money to pay the trial
fees.
Judge Slack announced that he had no
right to compel jurors to waive their fees.
It the plaintiff wanted a jury trial she
woula have to pay the fees, and if she did
not ne would not hear the case. He would
rather under any circumstances that it be
transferred to some other court.
Baldwin's attorney objected to any con
tinuance or transfer. He wanted the case
to go to trial as soon as possible and if the
jurors' fees were not paid he insisted that
the case be heard and determined by the
court.
Miss Ashley's attorneys thought that by
Monday they might rind some philan
thropic individual who would advance the
fees. The case was then continued till
Monday and the Judge announced that at
that time she must either pay the fees or
waive a Jury.
TAINTED WITH CRIME.
Boys Confined in the County
Jail With Hardened Old
Offenders.
iheriff Whelan Is Working to Have
Them Protected From the
Dan-er.
Sheriff Whelan and Under Sheriff Clack
are making a determined effort to change
the present custom of disposing of the
youthful offenders who are arrested for
petty offenses and remanded by the Po
lice Judges, before whom they are brought,
to the Superior Court for trial.
Formerly the Police Judges had the
power of sending the juveniles to the
Whittier or lone State schools, and
usually did so within a day or two after
their arrest.
The last Legislature, however, passed an
act putting the committing power in the
hands of Superior Judges only. In the
present crowded condition of the Superior
Court calendars it is often weeks and
sometimes months before the cases can
be given a place. In the meantime the
lads are kept at the County Jail, where
hundreds of the most degraded criminals
are confined. No matter how much care
is taken in isolating them as far as the
limited facilities will permit, they are
certain to bear more or less of the vile talk
of the more hardened offenders, and to be
tainted by the subjects they hear dis
cussed.
"A month spent in a place like that,"
said Under Sheriff Clack yesterday, "will
do a young and impressionable boy more
injury than years of training at the State
schools can efface."
Mr. Clack called on District Attorney
Barnes yesterday and asked him to use
his influence to induce the Superior
Judges to eive preference to cases of this
kind and have them placed on the calen
dars for trial as soon as they are remanded,
so that if deemed necessary they can be
placed beyond the influence of the crim
inal influence as early as possible.
There are now sixteen young boys in the
County Jail, some of whom have been
there for six or seven weeks awaiting trial.
Among them are: J. Sullivan, William
Dunbar, John Bush, Alfred Jones, John
O'Brien, F. Montague, C. Hobbs, H.
Davis, William Latimore, Charles- Bona,
Daniel McAvoy, Fred Marshall and
Edward Murphy.

The Death of Young Fred
Bell Expected at Any
Moment.
HIS MYSTERIOUS HURTS.
His Regard for a Young Lady
Who Resides in the Ferry-
House.
A PARISIAN SCANDAL REVIVED
Private Detectives Who Believe That
Bell Did Not Meet With an
Accident,
Cerberus-like, a stalwart negro guards
the portals of the "House of Silence."
Callers at the lugubrious mansion on
Bush and Octavia streets are all treated
alike. It is not, "Madam is away from
home" or "call again," it is plain: "Now,
yo' look heah, young man, yo' move right
'long; no pusson heah wants talk to yo'
kind folks."
And still it is to this house that Dr. P.
The "Uouse of Silence" Where Banker Thomas Bell Met With a Tragic and
Mysterious Death Fonr Years Ago. It Is in This Mansion That the Widow
and "Mammy" Pleasant Live, and They Refuse to Give Details of the Recent
Accident Which Befell Fred Bell, Who Is Now Dying as His Father Died.
A. Kearney directs every one desiring in
formation touching upon the fate of younÂ»
Frederick Bell.
Bell's life is fast ebbing if it has .not al
ready passed away after an accident or
worse, which occurred more than a week
ago. The people of his immediate sur
rounding have studiously refused to make
known the details of the strange affair,
and as the days go by the mystery grows
deeper.
â¢Thomas Bell, the young: man's father,
died as a result of an occurrence similar
to the present one. He, a millionaire, i
with attendants to watch his every move
ments, was said to have strayed away from
his bedroom toward midnight four years
ago, falling down a circular stairway and
meeting with death on the basement ce
ment flooring two floors below. No one
saw the happening until the sickening
thud of his body as it struck called atten
tion to the fact that something dreadful
had occurred. The details of that tragedy
were withheld for days until the tongue of
gossip was silenced at the Coroner's in
quest.
Even then dreadful suspicion of foul
play was rife, to be revived at this late day,
when the wealthy man's son is lying on
his deathbed under circumstances so sim
ilar that they are positively startling.
The latest traeedy occurred at the house
1107 Bush street, kept by Mrs. Clinton D.
Ferry, a lady whose prominence as the
wife of "The Duke of Tacoma" once
brought her into contact with the news
paper world. Under the circumstances she
has an aversion for all news-seekers, and
she, following the example of Dr. P. A.
Kearney, stands like a signpost on a de
served road, pointing toward the "House
of Silence."
Mrs. Ferry, it will be remembered, vis
ited Paris, France, some years ago with
her wealthy husband. While there she
met a most seductive young ribbon-aeller,
who was a clerk in the Bon Marctie. The
gallant young Frenchman became a con
stant visitor at the Ferry hotel, where it
subsequently turned out in the divorce
case he had installed himself as an instruc
tor of the "Duke's" wife in the French
language.
The scandal was first published in the
newspapers the world over when "The
Duke of Tacoma" became so jealous that
he called upon the gendarmes to enforce
the laws of the country and arrest Mrs.
Ferry. To do this it was necessary to find
the suspected couple together. Mr. Ferry
furnished the opportunity. He had the
clerk watched, and having located him he
burst open the door leading to his wife's
apartment and gave her in charge of tiie
officers.
But that is all ancient history. Mrs.
Ferry, the divorcee, is now a boarding
house keeper at 1107 Bush street, a piece
of property belonging to the Bell estate.
When it was leased to her a room was re
served for young Frederick Bell, who has
occupied it off and on ever since he and his
mother had a falling out over a division of
the estate.
In the Ferry house are other boarders
ami lodgers, the greater number of whom
bave no place in this story. But there is
one young lady among several others to
whom Fred Bell paid assiduous attentions.
To her is due the fact that the young man
had greatly mended his ways. His erst
while frequent breaks from a sober path
occurred more seldom. It was Bell's
habit to go to her for consolation during
those periods following his debauches, and
while nursing a sore head he learned to
think more and more of his gentle nurse.
But there was another Richmond in the
field. He. too, thought a great deal of
the young lady boarder. He was not so
fortunate as young Bell, insomuch that
â be lived in another neichborhood. He
was a frequent caller on her, however, and
at times the two young men burned Mrs.
Ferry's i:as very late, each trying to out- j
stay the other.
Bell conceived a visible dislike for his
rival, who returned it with interest. He
showed it especially when he was in bin
cups, for he, too, sometimes looked upon
the wine when it was red.
The other people in the Ferry house
have been in momentary expectancy that
some day there woula be an inebrious
clash, and the friends of Bell on the out
side are prone to believe that it came on
the night he was found unconscious,
broken-limbed and bleeding on the floor
to which be had fallen.
At all events a private detective agency
in looking tue matter up, and even if Fred
erick Bell never does recover conscious
ness enough to tell bow the- midnight
tragedy occurred, surrounding circum
stances and the testimony of the fair
charmer may tell the tale.
In the meantime the mystery keeps
growing darker.
Mrs. Bell, widow of Thomas Bell and the
mother of the young man Fred Bell, re
mains closely confined in her man
sion at Octavia and Bush streets.
There, protected by Mammy Pleas
ance, who became so prominent as
fearah Althea Hill's champion in the cele
brated Sharon divorce suit, no one can
apDroach her. She is the one most inter
ested in young Bell's life or death, as his
" lt . e , rest ln the property left by Thomas
Hell means a half million dollars more or
less to her share of the estate.
In speaking or Mammy Pleasance, who
advises Mrs. Bell in her mode of pro
cedure, it may be recalled that only a few
days ago Judge Belcher and a jury of twelve
prominent taxpayers, left the City Hall
courtroom to dance attendance upon the
old colored lady and get her testimony in
the case of a man named Saville, who was
charged with forgery.
Mammy Pleasance was too ill, so it was
said, to leave her bed to attend court and
testify to the guilt of the man she was
prosecuting. The court and jury, there
tore, sought her in her bed in the "House
of Silence."
The very next day Mammy Pleasance
was up and around with the vigor of a
20-year-old girl, and she has been up and
around ever since, just as she was only a
few hours before she held the levee for
Judge Slack and the jury.
Saville, the defendant in the case, was
convicted and ia now serving a term of
years in the penitentiary.
In this Saville case, as in the dual acci
dents of Thomas Bell and his son, the
tongue of gossip has been busy, growing
more busy as the interested parties make
the Fred Bell case more mysterious.
A LITTLE CHURCH.
The Rev. Oliver C. Miller Has Started
the Second Evangelical Lutheran
Church Here.
The Rev. Oliver C. Miller, who some
years ago started the first English Evan
gelical Lutheran Church in this City, and
which now has a prosperous congregation
and a fine edifice on Geary street, near
Gough, has returned from his Southern
home in Virginia and started his second
English Lutheran Evancelical Church of
the Holy Spirit in what is known as the
"Little Brown Church," at 2127 Jackson
street.
Previous to locating on the present site
the Rev. Mr. Miller conducted services in
Franklin Hall, on Fillmore street, where
he assembled about him quite a numerous
congregation, sufficient to give him en
couragement to purchase a building and
transform it into a little church. The rev
erend gentleman expects before many
years to build a more pretentious and com
modious temple, as he is a most earnest
missionary in the Evangelical Lutheran
fold.
There are quite a number of Evangelical
Lutheran churches in this City, but these
mentioned are the only two where the Eng
lish language is spoken.
WAS NOT HIS WIDOW,
: The Long Suit of Henrietta Hey
denfeldt Ended Last
Eve Ding.
She Was Hedenfeldt's Half-Sister and
Entitled to No Part of His
Estate.
The Heydenfelt case, or that phase of it
which has for so long occupied the atten
tion of Judge Coffey, came to an end last
evening; by the verdict of the jury in favor
of the defendant.
The verdict of the jury was rendered on
twenty-one points. The principal one was
that there had been no marriage between
Henrietta Heydenfeldt, the plaintiff, and
Solomon Heydenfeldt. The jury also de
cided that she was his half-sister.
The action just decided was an applica
tion by Henrietta Heydenfeldt to have
distributed to her a widow's share of the
estate of Solomon Heydenfeldt, deceased.
She alleged that she had been married
to him at Sacramento in secret, and that
he had ordered her to keep the fact from
every one. She was answered by the alle
gation that she never had been married
to him, and, besides, she was his half
sister. The case has taken several weeks
to try.
The jury retired at 5 o'clock last evening
and returned with a verdict at 8:40 on the
first issueâ that there was no marriage
between the contestant, Henrietta Her
bert, and the deceased Solomon Heyden
feldt. As there were no findings on the
other twenty-one issues, the Judge asked
the jury to retire and return with findings
on all the issues. In five minutes they
| returned with a verdict for the defendants
on all the issues.
This, in effect, decided that Heydenfeldt
was married to Catherine Collins in 1864
who bore him four children, and that in
1887 lie was married to Elizabeth Angeline
i Howard, who survived him, and who bore
| him five children. Also that Henrietta
Herbert was Heydenfeldt's half-sister and
not his stepsister, and that she did not
bear him any children.
CHARGES OF FRAUD.
The Receiver of the S. S. Construction
Company Makes Serious Ac
cusations.
John L. Haskell, receiver of the insolv
ent 8. S. Construction Company, is suing
to have C. C. Butler cancel some notes be
I holds against the corporation, and to de-
I liver np some bonds of the San Francisco
and San Mateo Company, by which they
we're supposed to be secured.
He is also suing the California Safe De
posit and Trust Company to pay over to
him the dividends due on'the bonds from
the sale of the road a few days ago.
The notes Butler holds represent $200,
-000. This sum, the complaint states, was
paid into the treasury by Butler as presi
dent of the concern, not individually. It
is alleged that this was aone to defraud
and injure the creditors of the copora
tion.
The Donds were held originally by the S.
S. Construction Company, and the" charge
is made that Bntler fraudulently assigned
them to himself to secure his supposed
debt.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 8, 1896.
AFTER THE CONVENTION.
The Victory of John D. Spreckels
Is Discussed as a Local
Party Triumph.
BOSS DOMINATION IS KILLED.
Republicans Review the Convention
With Satisfaction and Go
to Bed Early.
Republican politicians took up little
room and made little noise downtown
yesterday and last evening. The political
calm contrasted strikingly with the hurly
burly and the intense interest in pending
affairs of the preceding few days.
The Republican leaders and the active
workers generally had been to Sacra
mento. They were very tired. They
rested. More than several, even of those
who got back to the city Wednesday, went
to bed with the chickens last night. The
Union League Club was nearly deserted
last evening.
The hotel corridors echoed little politi
cal talk. At the various political head
quarters there was just a little quiet and
satisfied conversation, reviewing conven
tion events and exchanging stories.
This quietude naturally followed the
settlement of all the pending party affairs â
the matters of policy, of contention, of
doing and beingâ that had been the sub
jects of the hard labors, the exciting con
tentions, the rivalries, the ambitions, the
hopes, fears and prophecies of the pieced
ing weeks.
The State Convention is over. Now
other pending affairs move into view.
They werq still somewhat distant and
vagufi yesterday. They will take on shape
ana interest as the near-by days and weeks
go by.
One thing that loomed up strongly yes
terday was the certainty that the grand
victory, or rather the series of victories,
achieved by Jonn D. Spreckels at Sacra
mento insures to San Francisco a year of
clean and honorable municipal Republi
can politics. BR9I
Everywhere yesterday Republicans dis
cussed . quietly the State Convention, re
viewing its chief events and results, and
everywhere this glorious prospect of the
party was clearly recognized. All who
could tell the meaning of anything politi
cal knew that John D. Spreckels came
back from Sacramento stronger than ever
and that his leadership of the local party
was made absolutely sure.
It was recognized that he had come
back with even more loyal friends than he
had a week ago; that his clean record
would give him a still wider public confi
dence; that the ability, executive force,
talent for organizing, clearness of brain,
cleanliness of motive and character, dis
position to let the people rule and the
loyalty to the people and to the highest
interests of the party which he has dis
played in the section of the campaign just
ended would win for him added apprecia
tion, admiration ana respect in the local
party, which has so far followed his ad
vice and policy with nearly perfect
unanimity.
It was clearly seen that the victory of
Mr. SDreckejs at Sacramento means that
the party will not, in this campaign, at
least, be dominated, manipulated and ;
traded by an unscrupulous and corrupt
political "boss or by a combination of
bosses.
This is one of the results of ths State
Convention. It could be seen, too, now
slight and weak had been the selfish oppo
sition to the regular party organization.
It could be perceived yesterday, as it was
thus early seen, how completely this oppo
sition had gone to pieces.
Even thÂ«* recent kickers were, as a rule,
taking their defeat with surprising good
grace and cheerfulness, and showing a
disposition to get in and make a united
party in the interest of Republicanism.
Such was the tenor of post-convention
talk generally yesterday and last night.
To say that most of the local Republicans
who were interested in convention were
quietly elated is to state the fact weakly.
'1 he exultation that immediately followed
the convention had not subsided.
Of course all the chief features of the con
vention were generally discussed. Every
where was satisfaction. The unexpected
harmony of the convention was com
mented on. The smallness of the number
and size of the sore spots was a source of
both surprise and gratification. There
was generally exhibited a feeling that its
energy, spirit and confidence would
steadily increase until the plainly certain
victory is won.

DON'T ASK FOR BITUMEN,
Cycle Board of Trade Says the
Teamsters Misunderstand
Them.
To Go Into Politics "Up to the Handle-
Bars of Their Wheels" for
Park Lights.
The Cycle Board of Trade held a spirited
meeting at Biclorama Hall last evening.
The most important themes discussed
were the lighting of the park and the re
paying of Market street.
\Y. K. Wheeler repeated his report made
to the Board of Supervisors at their last
meeting, in which Irving M. Scott had
stated that the Park Commissioners were
in favor of lighting the park and would do
so in case an appropriation could be ob
tained. The report gave rise to much dis
cussion, but after the wordy chaff had
been winnowed away the sense of the
meeting seemed to be that expressed by
C. D. Salfield. Said Salfield :
"These promises will amount to nothing j
unless we get the proper appropriation.
Lit us get into politics up to the handle- \
bars of our machines by July and elect i
men that wili make the appropriation, i
Then no excuse lor failing to light the i
park can be given."
On the subject of repaying Market street
speeches were made to show that the
teamsters were opposed to the movement,
because they erroneously supposed fiat i
the cyclists wished bitumin to be used, i
wnich would prevent their hauling as :
heavy loads as at present. Said Thomas
H. B. Vatney:
"1 think the /teamsters misunderstand
the proposition. Wliai we want is some- â ,
thine that will give cummon satisfaction.
We don't want something for cyclists
alone; we want something thai will im- I
prove tne street for the common good."
The committee on a mass-meeting re
ported that they wished more time, and
would probably arrange for such a gather- j
ing in June, when the Camera Club and i
the engineer of the Merchants' Asso
elation would have prepared stereopticon
views of the pavements In different cities, j
in order to add interest.
Judge Kerrigan of the League of Ameri- \
can Wheelmen, said they were ready to
render any assistance that lay in their j
power, but were tired of theorizing and j
wanted something tangible.
Mr. Miller of the Highway Improvement
Club explained a plan for paving between
the cartracks with a material for cyclists
and other parts with something better
puited to heav}' vehicles. Then, he
said, a law could be passed preventing
teams from driving on the cycliats' road,
except at necessary crossings. His speech j
was applauded, but many members
thought the scheme impracticable.
A communication from the Point Lobos
Improvement Club, inviting other clubs I
to send live delegates to meet May 0 ana !
form a federation for the pnrpote of re- !
ducing carfares, was rqad by the secre- '
tary. A resolution was adopted empower- I
ing the president to name live delegates to j
represent the club.
The board then went into executfve Â»es- j
sion.

THE BOMB HAS BURST,
The Defection in the Salvation
Army Has Gone as Far
as It WilL
SO SATS THE COMMANDER.
Interesting Talk of the Consul With
the Auxiliaries â Officers
Leave To-Day.
The Commander and Consul Booth-
Tucker bad a busy day yesterday. Wi th
the commander goes the headquarters of
the Salvation Army in the United States
and that means an immense quantity of
business. The early morning was de
voted to correspondence. A little before
noon the commander started on a tour of
the Salvation Army institutions on this
side of the bay â Captain Woods' Lifeboat,
the Children's Home and the Women's
Shelter.
At 3 o'clock they met with the Auxil
iaries at Metropolitan Temple. The con
sul, being a very sick woman, remained
in bed until just before this meeting.
There she made the address of all the ad
dresses of her visit.
Her audience was not as large as those
of the evening meetings, but it was won
completely. She spoke of the desertion of
Ballington Booth from the army. First as a
family matter that was the greatest sor
row the family had suffered; that it was
telling upon her father greatly in the mat
ter of his health despite his efforts to over
come it by hard work. But the more
serious effect of the defection of the former
commander of the army was the blow it
struck at the army itself.
It would not be strange if the American
troops should look with suspicion and dis
trust upon the new commanders, or that
many of them should have followed the
former commander in his new movement
as they had followed him in the old. The
wonder was that the army had proved so
true; that they had shown their devotion
and ioyalty to the army itself and its prin
ciples; had waited patiently in darkness
until some explanation could be given or
word came from the general.
Tne last words her father said to her as
he kissed her through the carriage window
as the train was moving out of the station
in London were, "Turn the eyes of the
army from the controversy and toward
the throne of God." She had found the
great mass of the army steadfastly looking
to tee throne and gaining strength there.
She bad received a letter from the gen
eral, she said, that very morning, in which
he said that the defection m America
must certainly work for good ultimately.
''It is not given to every nation to be
put to such a test of its fealty to the work.
America had been having a very easy time
of it compared with those countries where
the soldiers were persecuted, put in jail,
their confiscated. The Lord seemed
to have been at the trouble to set the army
in America, by this great trial, as a city
on a hill that could not be hid. The
world would look now to see what stuff
the Salvation Army of this country was
made of. We are going to give them
something to look at," she said. "Let
them look now; we invite it; it will do
them good. We are to have greater victories
than ever. The work has really only
bemin here. If you would only see the
letters thrust upon us from eager workers,
saying, 'If tbÂ«re be room, if any "are fall
iDg out, *,ive me a place; I want to be an
oflicerin the Army,' you would be sure
that a time of rapid progress is here. For
this work, to take part in it, I will gladly
leave home and country for the rescuing
of the sinful, the weak, the need}."
Commander Booth-Tucker in an address
said that the army had really lost but very
few officers and soldiers by the defection,
and that the bomb had burst and practi
cally all the damage that it could do had
been done.
A big meeting was held at Metropolitan
Temple last evening, and a number of
converts went forward to the penitent's
bench.
This morning the consul and com

WOMEN IN CONGRESS.
Splendid Address by Miss Eliza

Maine.
HISTOEIC VIEW OF WOMAN.
Charles A. Murdock Reads a Paper
od Our " Fore-Mothers" at the
Evening Session.
Stainless callas, graceful annunciation
lilies, white roses, snowballs and margue
rites made the stage at Native Sons' Hal!
look like a bridal bower yesterday. Inter
est in the great Woman's Congress seems
to increase day by day- Yesterday sev
eral ladies expressed the keenest dis
appointment when they found it impossi
ble to get within hearing distance of the
speakers. The entrance w-ay was thronsed
with eager, enthusiastic women, whose
lively interest in the proceedings gave
them endurance sufficient to stand the or
deal ol" passing hour after hour on foot in
one cramped position.
The first paper, on "Prinritive Woman,"
was by Mrs. Sara Gamble, i^he ;-aid :
In the primitive form of marriage men fought
for their mates, ana in all probability the primitive
woman looked on in aeligh: at the combat fur her
ownership. The difficulties of presenting ary
thing beyond mere specutution ot our primitive
foremothers are very great, as sne no lonsjer exists
anywhere.
l oo not believe, however, that she is worth con
sidering except as an am nra until long after she
has a well aeveloped Â«rea. toe to her loot instead
of a hypothetical thumb: until long after the
period when her mate built her a temporary home
of twigs in a tree and remained with ber only a
season Instead of for life. She must have been a
wife with something binding about tbe marriage
tie before she is ready to pose as a human being.
lii calling up primitive woman from her long re^
tirement I have availed myself of four sources
history, deductions from mythology, considera
tions of woman's qualities now and what sne would
do stripped of civilization and placed in primitive
circumstances.
It has been tritely said that the difference be
tween barbarism and civilization is simply the dif
ference between, Â« wigwam and a lady's boudoir.
Earlier testimony describes the women of Gaul as
beinÂ« fiercer in battle- than their husbands, coming
up to the charge with blezing eves, streaming hair
and loud, hoarse criesâ Hinging their huge fists,
â¢â¢upalileof beating In the sUul! of an adversary.
They were ready to die for their chastity when
taken prisoners nnd killed their children to pre
serve them from slavery. TnlÂ« primitive woman
took care of the tint, kept the fire aoing, gave birth
au<l training to the young warriors, tougbt at her
husband's side, and wnen he was ont of temper
arid cave ber a beatinp: she was able to return It
with interest.
No one could conceive that the model which
stood for the pictures presented by these myths
were weak, dependent creatures who wanted to
be ivy leaves and twine or to repose on a sofa or
bank all day. Brunhildn's lovers must fight and
win ihree combats with her to gain her hand, and
Rhe was so strong that sue was only overcome by
a stratagem at laol. Early Scandinavian litera
ture is full of such instances, and it is refreshing to
turn from the namby-pamby heroines of the civi
lized descendants of these same people.
There is something eqxially suggestive in the
story of our first mother. Eve. Her curiosity, her
daring and her disobedience were magnificent.
Hhe cuts a better figure than Adam, who appar
ently would never have taken even a nibble at the
fruit of the tree of knowledgeâ Â» full meal of which
would have made them as wise as the gods. Pan
dora must not be ignoredâ her curiosity led her to
lift the lin.und so all theevils were let ont. Suffer
ing and shame result from both exploits. But if
we had always remain-d naked and innocent
w>: ere were the arts and all the interesting com
plications of civilized life? If evjl and suffering
are tbe natural preludes to knowledge and virtue
â¢we are proud 10 know thai the primitive woman
raised the curtain and gave the signal for the
tragedy to begin.
W.-stermarck describes four forms of marriage.
First, when men fought with each other for the
possession of women : second, she was an object
of barter, and hr suitor must pay a good price for
ber to her father: third, she made a choice of a
husband from combatants who fought for her
lavor: fourth, the peasant form, except In happy
America, where the laiher must pay a certain suiii
to the man coosentinc to marry ihe woman. This
laKt form would seem to insinuate that the woman
of to-day is not as useiul and desirable as her
primitive mother, and it is hard to say which form
leaves. woman with the most dignity.
At first glance we look at the earliest primitive
marriages, when men fought like animals for their
mates, with a shudder, but probably the primitive
woman looked on with pleasure and gladly gave
herself to the victor. Physical strength was tne
chief considerationâ wan what made a klngamonj;
men. Titles, money-bags, social position, leading
the cotillon with grace were In the dim future as
reasons for feminine | reference.
hollowing tbis primitive courtship came the
practice of the father demanding a price for his
daughter, which varied with her beauty, family
standing and drudirins? capacity. The higher the
price paid in shells or hard service the prouder the
primitive maiden, who would have felt disgraced
to iibss from her father to her husband as some
thing worthless.
'Ihe point which I wish to accent in all this is
that the primitive man paid or served for and
painfully adorned himself to sue for the primitive
woman, and that her industry, patience and con
trivance gave her a value quite equal, if not
greater than she has possessed in subsequent
stales of society.
Tbe conclusion of Westermarck in the end is:
"There is no doubt that under more primitive con
ditions woman was more free to choose than
â he is now among the lower races." Havelock
Kilis gives woman a higher place in physical evo
lution than man. Her arms are shorter, ber jaw
less protr.iding and her face smaller in comparison
to her head, these things suggesting greater differ
ence between her and the ape than between man
and the aj>e.
Miss Severance, the woman of ready thought In
all rhe discussions, had something to offer. She
said :
"The primitive woman by tradition is credited
with the invention of the needle, the basket and
the spindle. The [needle may have been only a
thorn, the basket a leaf, and the spindle a smooth
stick. Hut withal she was the Mr*i adapter of
means to ends. It may have been that man ma<!e
the first, bread, but we can hardly think that
the bri'ad was of angelic origin. 1 have no doubt
that the primitive woman made the first bread by
grinding acorns and baking them. She may also
have been the first planter, dlgir'ng holes with her
lint-rs and dropping in the seeds tbat were to
prove i lit- foundation of the harvest, the orchards
and the wheat fields of later times."
'â¢I nave seen the primitive woman exhibit her
eood points on other lines," remarked Mrs Bid
well. â¢â¢Â«nd wi'.s much to-iclied by It. A little In
aie.n t>oy was dying of consumption. He coughed
once when I was visiting him. and needed to ex
pectorate. Two old Indian women passed him a
cuspidor, an old woman holding a handkerchief
between the vessel and myself. These Indians
wore diggers. Yet this Is only one of countless in
stances of delicacy and refinement among t hem."
Mrs. Marshall had a little personal observation
to relate.
"While way up in the Sierras last summer," she
said, "I saw an Indian riding a horse and beside
him wulked the woman carry him a | appuose and
a large supply of household stuff, but he had
nothing to carry."
Sirs. Nellie messing Eysier, a w .man known as
a writer and a suflratrlst leader, discussed woman.
"In .Savagery." a subject tjat she uÂ°eated In the
following wa\ :
â¢â¢1 do not wonder that the ship carpenter carves
tbe head of a womon on tbe prow of bis vessel nor
that railroad appliances and locomotives are ad
dressed as she, for woman in savagery was the
first beast of burden of the earth. From her back
to the stately ship and the flying steamcar lies the
evolution of all that is involved in tne word 'trans
portation,'or "the carrying industry,' an act that
has sent our race exploring and possessing tbe
whole earth. Nor do i wonder that % tual great
pal Â»Wter ol the plastic tendencies of clay, 'ihe pot
ter's wheel, was described by the poet us 'Twirling
on her axis, and ever as she turns new forms of
beau.y doth create.' Kor women in savagery were
inn first ceramic artisans and developed all the
technique, the forms and tbe uses ot the pottery of
to-day.
"Between the Eskimo woman at Point Barrow
and the Temple of Vesta at Rome, b"tween the
arid plains of Arizona nnd New Mexico and the
I'ryUineum at Athens, lie leagues of distance, but
between the rude soaps:one lamp of the former
and the exquisite vases wiiich adorn tbe altars of
the latter are the links of the ceramic art as in
vented by in savagery.
' Women In s vaÂ«Â«ry were the first weavers. I
Centuries ..> io.v, the classical Penelope wove the
famous wet) by which sne saved ber wifely honor.
tne Carib women of South Africa, the aborigines
of America, Polynesia of Australia, the squaws of j
Navajo, tbe luipas ot California, in brief, tbe '
women in savagery everywhere, had invented the i
tex: Be Industry known an basketry and weaving,
and evt-ii before : hem had come the mothers of the
r '. ' -. -i"n . ng tim-ads, drawing them out and
outting them off.
-*'luM climax of modern womanhood, the fine
lady, who by her personal grooming and Intel
lectual re tinemeut is an ideal of supreme art in
looks and behavior, had her beginning in sav
agery. In savagery women are tbe hair-cutters,
the>havers anil tattoers, and this characteristic
struggle for beauty In every direction, by every
woman, had a most refining effect upon society in
its infancy. In the conservation of ihe history of
language woman has played an important part
tnron^h ber knowledge of folk lore. In all nur
-â¢â ry rliymcMiwl riddles and Jingles bits of ancient
philology and traditional wisdom have oeen traus
ir.itred lor centuries. As a patron of religion wo
men in savagery have enriched iribal and national
mythologies with elements peculiar :o our own
modern ideas of heaven. As a proof of the strong
and strange survival of this ancient fancy the
statue of Crawford's armed Liberty On the dome of
the Capitol in Washington to-day ts called by the
American people th" Uoddes* of Libert}-.
At this era of American women's political ine
quality U is a cold satire. The lowliest of the
lowly to-day are the Andaman Islanders, yet our
boasted civilization may learn a lesson from them;
for says the highest English authority, "So far as
the contract of marriage being regarded as a tem
porary arrangement, to be set aside at the will of
either party, no incompatibility of temper or
other cause is alioweu to dissolve the union, and,
while bigamy, polygamy, polyandry and divorce
are unknown, conjugal infidelity is not the excep
tion, bnt ihe rule, and matrimonial differences are
soon settled without the Intervention of friends."
Among the Wyaudottes, the Mohawks and Iro
qnois the social organizations form groups, all of
which are recognized, viz.,: the family, the gens,
the phraty and the tribe. The head of* the family
is the woman. When a woman is installed as
councilor a feast is prepared by the gens to which
she belongs. She is oainted and dressed id her
best attire, and the gentll cbaplet of feathers is
placed upon her bead by the sachem of the tribe,
who announces in a solemn manner that this
woman has b<-en chosen a councilor. The councils
are between tbe sexes, no distinct. on being made.
The tribal council is held regularly on tbe night
of the full moon aud conducted with great cere
mony. Such are the organic functions of iribal
government In savagery, the object being to pre
serve rights and enforce the performance of duties.
Ferocious, wild, uncultivated, untamed, un
taught, uncivilized, unpolished, rude, heathenish,
cruel, inhuman, fierce, pitiless, unmerciful, atro
ciousâall these are synonyms for savagery, and
yet the phrase "woman in savagery " seems a
paradox in that connection.
The road from tbe woman in savagery to the fin
de siecle queen of society is long Indeed. Who can
estimate its countless miles of toilsome travel,
its pitiless, patient plodding and its journey ings to
and fro across the swelling Jordans of prejudice
and igaorance? Ihe maternal instinct, the strong
hack, tne deft hand, the instinctive aversion to
aggressive employment, the conservative spirit
were there in flower.
The phrase the survival of the fittest refers gen
erally to plants and animals; but there is a higher
law as well as a lower one of the survival of the
fittest, and the emancipation and exaltation of
women is alwnys the synonym of progress. All
the social fabrics of the world are built round her.
Both web ami woof are as yet sadly imperfect, but
the thought of ivi perfection lies behind them.
Thoughts are things, cod help her to preserve
her holy Ideas.
"Savaee woman," remarked Miss Sever
ance, "waÃ-innately honest before she be
came contaminated by traders of tbe
plains. A trader <vss asked by a squaw to
lend her a shirt pattern, as she wished to
gamble, for among those Indians shirt
patterns were standard currency â no silver
question bothered them. Well, that
squaw returned later in the night with
two shirt patterns as a result of her gam
bling. That might have been considered
gambling with a purpose."
Mrs. Swett told another story.
"During one of my summer vacations,"
she said, "I noticed the squaws gathering
berries for the white traders. One of the
newly married Indians tried to get his
wife's wages. But Bhe knew a thing or
two, and slipped her band in above that
of her husband, clutched the money and

sped off with the reward of her labor.
That squaw had a good idea of woman's
riphti.' 7
Mrs. E. G. Greene of Santa Cruz, a
suffragist prominent in kindergarten
work, took up the dfaenssion of "Woman
in Barbarism." In part she said:
In the Colum blan exhibition the place of honor
was occupied by the colossal statue of a young
woman represented in burnished <rold. In one
hand she held the world, in the other tbe cap of
emancipation or liberty. Upon her right hand
stood the oulldlng devoted to tbe manufactures
and liberal arts, upon her left the temple of agri
i-ultuie. In the distance the dairy, the leather and
: horticulture building*. At the extreme south of
the grounds was an exhibit from the cemetery of
A neon in Peru.
One figure was of special interest in this conn*c
| tlonâ the skeleton of an ancient Peruvian woman.
I It was In a crouching attitude, wrapped in the cus
tomary grave-clotnea, and auout it wer* spindles,
cmdle-frttme, pottery and di-hes of veettublea
with which she was familiar in her life and from
i which her spirit was not to be separated in her
j death.
The statneof liberty represents the high lit hts
or civilization. The skeleton of the and nt woman
the shadows of savagery: back in the perspective,
creeping out from the shadows, the veiled woman
of barbarism might b<* seen, enthroned in the
gilded apartments of the harem, dressed in elegant
attire, bedecked with jewels, lounging upon luxu
rious cushions, surrounded by a retinue of serv
ant, forbidden tfr entrr tlie streets unveiled or un
attended; or she migh* op seen oppressed as a
slnre In service, In the abject humility of asceti
cism, or In the obedience of caste. Again as a
queen at court and the leader or follower in battle.
As tbe mother and toller In the home and in the
| field. As an Industrial fnctor In th<- family and In
' lne . trtbe - A Â» the social ruler aud the ethical
I guide. As a builder of civilization the power be
hind the throne.
Herodotus tells us before t he time of Mohammed
women were acquired by inheritance, asllv.' stuck.
lhe custom of buying wives not only prevailed in
the early days of barbarism, bot In a Ligh state of
barbaric civilization.
Mohammed paid for certain of his wives two
drams of silver, a hand mill, a water Jar, a pillow.
Mr. Layard relates that a >oung girl rushed Into
his tent one day in great despair: her mother had
sold her for iwo sheep, two donkeys and two rueas
: ores ot wheat. She did not wish to m*rry the
young man. and finally he was persuaded to take
I bnck the price un<l give up the maiden. Mohamnie
| dens have numerous proverbs expressive of tbe
I very low estimate they put upon woman. Dr. H.
U. Jessup, in his valuable book entitled the
Â» omen of Arabia," quotes as follows:
| "Obedience to women will have to be repented
â¢â¢The hear; of woman Is given to folly."
"Women are ihe whips of Satan."
"Alas for the poor people ruled by woman."
"Trust neither a king, a horse or a woman, for
I the king is laslidious. the horse liable to run away
, and the woman is perfidious."
j Arab women have distinguished thamielves by
bravtry hardly less than the men. Kecords of
armed heroine* frequently occur iv the myths ot
pre-Islamic times and In authentic history tJS6
A. D. Ayesbah. wife of Mohammed, led an army
I and tbis is only the first of a number of instan â â â s
j in which Arabamazone bay taken sword in hand.
It is now customary for an Arab force to be ac
, companiea by some courageous maiden, who
I mounted on a black camel, slugs verses of encoar
, agement of her own and of insult to the opposing
| tribe.
In the tinseled splendor of an ancient Persian
court we find Queen Vashtl who discloses to us the
social position of a few women in one of the early
Aryan races. She had the courage to maintain the
dignity of her womanhood and refuse tc present
herself amid the drunken revels of her husband's
"THE CALL'S " HEROIC AND SPELNDID ATTITUDE.
We get a further glimpse of the social customs i
and the position of women by the treatment of '
Vashti and the Introduction of Esther into the
court. A number of fair young maidens were
brought to the King, from whom he might select a
wife. These women wer<- in the custody of Hege,
the King's chamberlain and "keeperof the women.' 1
Esther pleased the King, and be made her his j
Queen. Her influence at court secured the liberty I
of her people.
The Bedouin woman has more freedom than her
Arab Bister. She does no; wear a veil, although
she sometimes throws the folds of lier dress over
her face when meeting a strante man upon the
highway, she walks the street inn in arm with
her chief, much to the disgust of the Arabian,
while the Bedouin looks down with contempt upon
the poor fellahs who dwell In houses and till tbe
soil. With a careless freedom they wander on tbe
mountains where Moses and the Hebrews viewed
the landscape o'er, and camp in places sacred to
the memory of great nations.
Some of the Tartar women follow the Turkish
women in matters of dress, others are dressed in
garments of skins. Women are largely the manu
facturers and wearers of these garments. Women
set up and take down the tents, pack them then
with their children and valuab es, join the caravan
either for war, plunder, or change of home. The
yell or tbe women In battle is the Inspiration of
the army. The women also care for the sick and
wounded.
Tbe only direct relation of woman to the system
of polity or body of principles by which the auto
cratic affairs of barbarism are administered is her
obedience to Its requirements and her mainte
nance of its institutions. She is a prodncerof wealth,
but has no voice in its distribution. In exceptional
cases she stands at tbe head of government, and
lias a decisive voice in its affairs. Tbe Influence of
woman in barbarism is more industrial, social and
ethical than political. Exercised under tbe law
of force, it is not always at its best.
To women it is said we owe the existence of the
family. The mother and child arc the unit of the
first step in civilization. When woman became
tired of Dealing children to be swept Into the com
mon mass she gathered them about her and gave
them her name; here became the nucleus of the
family; and when the father could stand by
her side an i call the children by his name tbe
family was established and parentage an acknowl
edges relation This then is woman's first stale
in eovernment; through woman the line of descent
wts first reckoned. She organized family life and
is everywhere its central power. Out from the
family grew the stale. Out irom family govern
ment the government of the state and of the larger
family, the nation.
It was the horde of women through all ages who
learned self-control under the oppression and sub
jection which barbaric life- imposed who be
queathed to their sons and their daughters that
amount of self-control and loyalty upon which a
free republic can safely build.
Then woman in barbarism will pass out from the
shadow into light and her stake In government
will be recoijnizeC aud redeemed, for she will
bring to government her rich inheritance from tbe
pastâ the crown and Klory of the future.
"Woman in the Ancient Civilization"
is the title of a most interesting paper by
Mrs. George Oulton of Bouldin Island,
which was read by Mrs. Edna Snell Poul
son. The following synopsis will give a
fair idea of the fascinating essay.
l-'aricy the feelings of Sir James Mackintosh
when Mme. de Stael called upon him to "tell her
the British Constitution in ten words." and you
will understand how one might feel upon being
asked to tiptoe from tbe first cataract to the delta
of the Nile, across to the basin of the Tigris and
Euphrates, thence down ilic Hellespont into the
.Â£gean Sea and around to the E.ernal lity â grate
ful at not being required to pirouette over (iaul or
stand i 'olosaus-like, one foot on the Iberian Penin
sula, tne oilier on tbe British Isles imitating
Canuteâ all in twenty minutes.
Were 1 to bÂ» asked what woman's relation to
government Is or has been in any period of human
culture, I should answer that she maintains and
always has maintained tbe most Intimate of pos
sible relationsâ that she Is i he government â that
nocne ever spoke to, or of, or from ber without
ustnf th* feminine - personal pronoun. M for In- |
stance: Weil, If England wants the earth, why >
lei her take It If she can. Especially is tnle true
â *Â»*â¢ thÂ« era of civilization.
That government in its feminine capacity has
always used men to administer her behests la only
the indication that she needed muscle. She even
added to this muscle a keen-edged weapon to cut
her way to what abe deemed right, and after the
opening of our era welded thereto the cross a han
dle. In considering the relation of woman as to gov
; ernment under the early civilisations let us cast
about for an initial pointâ a peÂ« In the cabinet of
memory, to which to attach a line for the display
of those adornments of fetnenlne character that
have lent themselves to the problems of govern
ment and at the same time accentuated the charms
that have claimed the attention of mankind.
I In ail earlier civilizations, as to-day, there have
; been periods waen women occupied the throne.
Nob!e pedigrees were almost invariably traced
through the female line, and this may make a base
' line .from which to proceedâ furnish the initial
point we seek.
Just here la the progress of culture is struck the
first chord In all the later harmonies. Now life is
secured and catered 10 and thought is winging it- ;
self in bright colored plumage so as to attract at- I
tention that its story may be heard.
> o estimate of woman's worth as a ruler can be
formed without linking the very point, It In I
savagery, barbarism or civilization when the royal
succession of tribe, clan, country or empire passed I
from the female line to the maleâ for from that :
moment indiscriminate paternity was atidoned .
and the woman was held sacred. She could now
transmit with the blood of the royal line the qual
ities of ruler or leader, the courage of chief, and
more often than not the vir;u>s of a king. Then
was the circle of the sacred lire drawn around her
within which she still standsâ possibly by man'?
selfishness, but he "bullded better than he knew."
The earliest legends relate that Belus, the great
est god of Kgyptlan worship, cut the darkness in
twain and so severed the body of the woman who
ruled over chaos. This is the first mention of a ;
feminine ruler, ana she was a failure, for she hu
never been able to reduce her realm to order.
-After cutting the woman In two be cut his own
head off and the trickling drops mingling with the
; earth to form man. Here man is the afterthought.
He still thinks that he In the result of some second
and better thought.
The suu god Ra was so solicitous for the royal
succession as to give it his personal attention when
he feared that carelessness or < aprice might taint
the blood â therefore daughters as well as sons ]
were held capable of transmitting the royal degree
and name. If it be true that, a nation's civilization
may be estimated by the more or less lofty posi
tion It accords its women the Egyptians surpassed
all other ancient peoples. Witli the second dyn
asty we learn that there was a law passed that
women could hold the sovereign power.
Queen Nlcrotis was the builder of me third pyra
midâthe first of double design (.might have known
It, cries the misogynist). Her historical character
ha* been loÂ« in a succession of legends. This
double designer is said by some to be the most an
cient form of the story of Cinderella.
In Moses' command to read and explain the law
to all people woman was Included byname. In
the exclamation of i)eboruti. the prophetess and
judge, we see where she gets her authority. â¢â¢The
Lord made me have dominion over the mighty."
She calls herself a "Mother in Israel," and by a
wlÂ«e administration of her power of prophetic
command gives the laud rest for forty years.
But for the stop-watch one would like to dwell
on some of the attributes of Sarah. Miriam, Debo
rah, Abigail, Huid.Â»h and Esther, not forgetting
Jezebel, that vigorous wife of a purling imbecile,
whose characterization we should like to translate
by some other term than termagant, as we are
quite convinced that the need produced the instru
ment. From Sarah to Esther the difference is as
wide as from earth to a star. sarah was a prin
cess over peoples, Esther was a radiant beauty to
a Persian Kingâ star to her people, but a single
star, not a constellationâ neither a "Cross" to her
husb.ind nor a â¢â¢Great Bear" to any one else. Sa
rah ruled In and of herself. Esther in and by means
of her Influence.
The Assyrian Rmplre was founded by Ninus and
â Semiramis. One skips, for the nonce, the part of
the history relating to Minus and the son Ninyas I
to center the attention on semiramis. We see ;
that she cannot be all a myth, as earth works j
bear the stamp of her fine hand. Writing was well
advanced and architecture had a permanent place
as an expression of the degree of culture of these
people.
Woman was always subordinate to the general
polity and without public or political power, but
the Mfc of separation Ip duties *nd pleasures was
â  neither flavorless to man nor colorless to woman,
i for ihWr occupations were so variedâ the climate
I demanded so much repose and there seemeu so
much that was supplemental in their anitude to
ward each other.
While the woman of Roman did exert a valiant,
patriotic and heroic influence, she had less politu-al
power than the woman of the north, but more
legal consideration than the Helene. Her Influence
In affairs was direct and Important, sometimes ele
vating and refining. She belonged to the family
more than to the community, and the State took
care of her Interests and provided for her welfare.
In the household she was as much mistress as tbe
mau was master, yet It was ai if a man should
confer the title, dignity and resi>onsibility of mis
tress of his household upon his child (as It is with
us to-day).
Mrs. oilphant says. In her late book on Rome,
speaking of the Empress Agnes, that "there Is
nothing that women have done so well as In the
great art of government."
Tbe wit might add thereto the comment tbÂ»t the
rpason Is that she accepts responsibility In her
very best moodâ toe imperative.
Without wishing to trench -upon tbe province of
the pr acher, which Is mainly to dilute a dogma,
we must In conclusion exhort woman to let her
mlook be honest and her expression a reflection of
that, so that in government, be It of self, or
nursery, or home, or country, she may refute the
cynic who says that when women rule well It Is
due to sound masculine advice, and when man has
ruled badly It is frequently due to baneful female
Influence.

The morning session tnen adjourned.
AFTERNOON SESSION.
Woman Viewed as She Is In China,
Japan and India, and From
Other Standpoints.
Miss Elizabeth N. Ymes of Maine
opened tbe afternoon session with an ad
mirable paper on "Woman in China and
Japan." Among other tilings, she said:
We find In J&pan. one of the most picturesque
Isles of the sea, a very picturesque class of women.
The women of that natio i have had belter advan
tages than the women of other oriental nations,
and as a result they have been tbe mothers of a
noble type of men. For centuries they have had
the advantages of education.
Wuy buck in history, a;most a mythical tradi
tion, there was a Joan of Arc in Japan, the wife
ofanKmperor. The si orv goes that it was con
ceded the J-mpiror was not considered good
enough for her.
She fitted out a military expedition, tradition
goes, and discovered Korea, and while there made
such au impression upon that people that they
pieailod with her to remain there as their queen.
It wm her son that afterward became a great mili
tary leader in Japan.
The present Empress of Japan has encouraged !
the fouuda. ion of training schools, orphanages and :
asyiuins; she is a great good woman. .Latterly tue j
Kmpresse* of Japan has appeared In the royal pro
cesrions side by side wttu the Kmperors, and not
following behind them as in former times.
1 In- J:i;;.iiie.se h.tv an excellent school system. I
The wile of oue of the pr.-a: military leaders In the I
recent war against China was a graduate of Vassar
' oiUt-e, and she was a great aid In counseling her !
husband.
With all the advances made by Japan in civili
sation in the lam century the general progress has
not been so great as the progress in the develop
ment of her women.
The ignorance of the average Chinaman con
[ cerning America la only equaled by the ignorance
â  of the averace American reesrdlnc China. Her*
| we see only th* hewers at wood and the drawers of
! water. As for the Chinese women whom we find
j In this country, they are generally-speaking, men
tal blank*.
Bnt In history we find n*ted several Illustrious
Chinese women of letters.
The first book ever written on th* higher ednca
â  tion of woman was by Pan Oow, a Chinese woman,
' who also completed the annals ot the empire,
; which had been commenced by ber brother. The
Empress Ann, In recent times, la a luminous ex
' ample of the kich-iulnded Chinese woman. Coun
{ cilors of State deferred to her jwig-npnt, and It la
j related that the i-.mperor once made nine proatra
[ tlons before her, which is considered the highest
honor which can be given to a human being.
An Impression prevails that female infanta born
In China have tbelr necks wrung aa soon as they
! come into the world. This la a great error. There
Is in the south of Cfeina a very poor district in
which the killing of children Is said to be more or
lewi frequent. Yet I doubt whether there Is not
more infanticide in China than in this country.
The mothers choose the wives for their sons and
they complain in their old age that tney nave dis
tasieful aaugbters-in-iaw. The Chinaman has no
right to take his wife away from the home of his
mothers
In C hina they have a society called the "Society
of Heavenly Feet." and they have often asked the
missionaries why the K..glish do not have a â¢â !Â»>
ciety of Heavenly Waists."
The women of Japan and China have their liter
ary societies.
1 nhail close with the message to-day of the
Bos. on Sorosis to the women of Japan and China:
"Toll them the world wnÂ« made lor women, too. "
Aa the world opens up for us 1 am glad to say it la
broadening up for them, too.
"The Chinese woman," said Miss Yates,
in answer to a question by Miss Sever
ance, "like the American woman, has no
legal claim upon the community prop
erty. Like her yister here she gives hor
all to her husband, and in return be
dresses her, clothes ncr and physic her as
he thinks fit."
"In what capacity did yon visit China
and Japan? ' askeu a woman in the audi
ence.
"i was twice in Japan and China as a
tourist, and lived hve years in China as a
missionary," answered Miss Yates, simply,
amid much applause.
In answer to another question, Alias
Yates said:
"Among the peasant class in Japan the
woman works side by side with her hus
band and eats at the same table with him
on a basis of equality, but as the social
scale is ascended, the man becomes a
figure of greater relative importance than
the woman."
The discussion then became general,
and much interest was shown in tbe sub
ject.
Miss Sarah D. Hamiin of this City, and
ior several years a resident in India and a
student of the social conditions of that
most conservative Oriental country, spoke
ot "Women in India." She said in part:
India, like other Oriental countries. Is sadly lack-
Ing in historic recorda. In their place is a con
fused mass of legends, traditions, customs and re
ligious laws, which must be read between tbe
lines for the story of historic development. To
the outside world India was known In a vague,
half-fabiiloiiN manner In the time of Homer, but it
was Alexander the (ireat who Introduced India to
the western world through bis invasion In 327
B. < '. Tbe accounts of ttiat date agree remarkably
with the conditions of life In India at the present
time, in spite of foreign conquests, tbe Infusion of
alien blood and the wearing effects of tweuty-two
â¢ enturies. Home and her provinces were familinr
with the brocades, fine muslins, silks, gems, apices
and many more of the natural productions aud
manufactures of India, but they added nothing to
historic lore. Thore is no donbt that early Chris
tianity pianted her standard in India by means of
Syrian missionaries, though tradition assigns the
honor to St. Thomas, the doubting Apostle. A
flourishing commerce arose between Venice and
other Italian republics with India through the so
called I>ark Ages of Knropean history.
The difficulty in considering this subject is (treat
because of the multiplicity of castes, religions,
languages, social customs and laces; because of
differences rine to thÂ«, climate and geography of
this vast region and because India is a land of con
tradictious and inconsistencies. What is true of
on* district may not be true of any other, and the
laws of one community may be the opposite of
those of another within sight. India is the camp
ing-ground of differences of belief, the home of
com rnrities. the nursery of hair-spiitt ing casuistry,
the place of the strongest accentuation of minute
differences In uabi:s of lift- and thought. Beneath
all this, however, Is a system to which all seek to
adapt themselves, and that is the religious and so
ciul system Imposed by the Brahmin priesthood,
without a knowledge of which no one can form a
conception ot Indian life and history.
In the sixth century, B. C, Buddhism and kin
dred reformed religious, entered like a wedge' Into
the great social and religious structure built up by
Brahmimsm. The life of Buddha was a typical
one, based on the Indian Ideal of the noble life.
He found, however, that the path of salvation did
not lie In the old asceticism, but in the nobler type
of the preacher, striving to bring deliverance to
others. To his banner flocked all classes of people,
even women, for In his religion women were per
mitted to become nuns, though no woman could
ever attain to Boddhahood without deing born
again as a. man.
It wab not, without a struggle that Gautama per
mitted tne order of nuns, such was the stigma at
tached to unmarried women in India. It is related
that women were indebted to the intercession of a
monk, Gautama's cousin Aiiaiaia, for permission
to found an order and that Buddha's nurse became
the first nun. Yet when Ananda asked, "How are
we monies lo behave when we see women?" Uau
tama replied, "Don't see them." "But ir we should
see them, what are we u> do?" -Don't speak to
them." "But If they should speak to us, what
then?" "Let your tbouKhts be fixed lv deep nseui
aation and niak* no reply."
Among other women of India are the Parsees
and Ben Israeli. Although they enjoy a greater
degree of freedom than ihe nigh-caste women, yet
it has always l>een true that the proud Jew or Par
see could thank God that he did not make him a
woman, and she would moot humbly thank uod
that he did not make her anything Â»orse, while
the proverbs of both inndoos and MohÂ»mmed.in ;
are full of the most abominable gibea about wom
an's inferiority to man, regarding her as an un
niiiigatcd evil, but the greatest evil of all being
that sne is necessary.
i here is, however, a dark side, and every reform
In India begins with some reference to the abuses
which woman suffers in connection with lntant
marriage, enforced widowhood, and her illiteracy,
lv splieof the restrictions of caste and custom.
Of law and religion. I wish to say that 1 have fouud
women nowhere* a "greater power behind the
throne" than in India. Itut, as I have already
said, India Is a !>u; of contradictions, and side ny
side wiih all that is most pure and lofty and holy
in life are the most cruel and degrading super
stitious.
Tne wonren of India are. however, their greatest
conservators, tue strongest ana bitterest opponent,
|ot reforms, although these rerorms se^k the
I amelioration of the evils from which they
I especially .suffer. There is In the Oriental woman
: a subrniSHiveuess, a self-depreciation, a conserva
' tisra which seems to be the crystallization of habits
of thought produced by the social system under
| which she lives, by the code of ilanu and by tbe
vicissitudes of her national history.
I Added to this, and perhaps mo*i important of
j all. is that doctrine of Brahminism, whereby
â  woman can secure eternal blessedness only so tar
â¢ as she contorms to all tbe minute regulations of
. her religion, whereby In thP whirling cycle of
j births and deaths she may some time Oe born a
man, live and die a man. aud tuns attain In this
blessed condition, to the heaven of heavens,
complete absorption In the Deity, or Nirvana.
In reply to a question from Miss Yates,
Miss Elizabeth Upham Tates, Who, Because She Is a Ready, Entertaining
Speaker, Was Brought Ont From Maine to Aid the Campaign for Equa 1 Suf
frage in California- She Spoke Yesterday Afternoon Abont Women in China
and Japan. Having Been Twice a Tourist and an Observer in Those Countries
and Later a Missionary in China for Five Years.
Miss Hamiin explained that everywhere
the Government in India is organizing
schools, but Tery few of the women take
advantage of them. Only about 6 per cent
of them can read and write even their
own vernacular.
Colonel Dickinson asked if the native
women of India are adopting the English
style of dress. The reply was that per
haps not more than one in a hundred of
the women converted to Christianity wear
the European dress; it is not encouraged
by the missionaries.
Miss Yates remarked that she had never
attempted to have the Chinese women
adopt the European costume, for she be
lieves theirs is vastly superior to ours, nor
could she advise them to adopt such as
her own, because the next fashion papers
from America might wholly change it.
Miss Agnes Manning of this City began
her paper, "Women in Northern Races,"
with a proud boast that she had converted
Sarah B. Cooper, the president of the
Woman's CongresÃ, to the suffrage move
ment. Continuing, she said in part:
"Our Herman women are too low in the social
scale," says a German writer, Jenny Hirsch, "to
dream of the franchise." our object is to lift them
out of their insignificance, frivolity, poverty, mis
ery and shame and train them for work which
will make themselves and others happy.
Here Is the law of Prussia: Children may not
marry without Ihe consent of their father. The
mother Is not even mentioned. By marriage the
husband obtains control of the wife's fortune.
Whatever the wife earns during her marriage be
longs to the husband. The wife may not spend a
cent of the fortune she brought to the husband.
He may squander It as be pleases.
The Bavarian statute-book says: The law al
lows the husband to chastise the wife moderately.
Women, with the exception of tbe motuer and
grandmother, are unfit to be cuardians.
The Germanic man has been greatly shocked
that his poor slavish Gretchen should aspire to tbe
higher education. He could complacently look on
at an overburdened wife and mo; her toiling up
four stones in his cities with a load of brick and
mortar on her shoulders, but for a young lady to
seek to enter a college was a most unwomanly
outrage on her whole sex that he was bound* to
prevent, slowly, inde-d. is he learning that Ood's
justice on tills earth Is neither for man nor woman
alone, but for both. If history teaches us one le-t
-son more forctnly than another it is this Inevitable
facâ that no bnman being can be trusted with
irresponsible power over another.
Before the dawn of Christianity the nations of
the north were little better than hordes of savages-
In their deep forests beyond the Rhine they lived
their wild lives, knowing nothing of the civiliza
tion that veneered the surface condition of their
southern neighbors. Or by the loneiv shores of
the Baltic, under cold, gray skies, th y pursued
their barbarous tasks with little to brighten the
present and only a gloomy mythology to speak to
them of a future. It does not require much imag
ination to picture tiit position of their women.
she knew nothing of the unrest of her little sis
ters in the to ber unknown lands of the south.
She had never eveu heard of the sunny Isles, I
where women, as soon as learning had been given j
them, had blossomed Into poetry and song, headed
by that great poet that all her contemporaries
united in putting her beside the greatest that
Greece has known. â ->he knew nothing of the dig- I
content that stirred other women by the banks of
the Tiber. She never knew how they combined !
together and even clamored at the gates of the I
senate against the unjust laws forced upon them
by tbeir tyrants. The dark-eyed women of Rome
were not quietly held In subjugation. Because
they were barred out of the world of letters they
have been unable to defend themselves from the
base slanders of the corrupt writers of their time.
The Germanic woman gave no cause for com
plaint, she knew nothing of combination, and if
It occurred to her to blame anything it was the
fate t nat made her a woman. All liberty for her
slept in the night of time. The semi-savage at
her side had no conception of liberty himself. No
man ever has that denies It to another. If he was '
rich be tyrannized over his people: if he was poor j
he bowed his head to the yoke. Whether rich or |
poor, the wife of his youth, the mother of his chil
dren, was a piece of goods, a household chattel, to
do by her as he saw fie.
Alas, for the history of the human race, woman j
was the first to be enslaved, and she will be the
last to be wholly free. Rough and rnde as we see
the condition of the Germanic woman, it yet never
sank to the degradation that her sisters touched in
the lands where the Mussulman's cruel edicts held
sway. The religions invented by some man to
gratify his baser animal nature from MohMmmedism
to Mormonism, and every shade of polygamy, have
always sacrificed women by the most unjust
usages-
A man in the gallery devoted some
minutes to a rather caustic review of the
addresses of Dr. Voorsanger and Miss
Shaw on the preceding evening.
"If that learned speaker," he said,
"wished to lay down the proposition that
tbe great ideal of womanhood was a very
PROUD OF "THE CALL"
intellectual being of fine physique hi*
standard is too low."
xMrs. Harland also spoke on the same
lines, complimenting Miss Manning on
her able paper.
A German lady said the miserable con
dition of German working women was dua
in great measure to the fact of men being
obliged to serve in the army.
Miss Bhaw's attention being called to
the gallery man's comment on her address,
she stood up for herself as follows:
"There are always reasons for things,
and the German woman has had to bear a
great many burdens that tbe German men
would have borne under different military
regulations. I should rather climb a lad
der with a great stone on my head, be
hitched with a dog in drawing loads than
be a worker in the sweat-boxes of a great
city like New York.
"I said that the coming woman would
be physically better. Most people think
women simply want the ballot. That is
not it. All we want is tools to caive our
way with. No woman will be perfectly
developed until she is physically and in
! tellectually developed, until she is free.
Of course we must have something else
besides tools; but women have been mak
ing bricks without straw since civilization
began. Laws do not make us free; they
keep us from getting, so, however.
"We have got to-day not only where we
believe we ougut to be free, but where we
insist on getting free.
"There has been nothing that has made
me leel how little we are removed from
barbarism as that debate a few days ago in
the great Methodist conference, that
women had no right in that body. One
thing that will be conceded to her is that
she will have the right to help pay the
bills.
"If woman had the proper spirit and
strength of character auch a condition
would not be possible and man be per
mitted to live in ease ana comfort in a
community. I shall reiterate what I aaid
last night. The woman to be will be
physically developed, intellectually de
veloped and averse to linKing her "life to
man amenable to a more lenient law of
morality than that that governs her."
The lady president read a cordial invita
tion addressed to the congress by ' the
Woman's International Congress at Ber
lin inviting its memb rs to a great assem
blage there in the fall. After that Mrs.
Mary Field of San Jose, writer, poetess
and founder of the California Chautauqua
Society, gave a fine paper on "Woman irÂ«
Feudalism." Her essay was a masterpiece
of quaint and beautiful word-painting,
borrowed from the buried treasure-houses
ol mediaeval times, and the gifted au
thoress was frequently interrupted during
its delivery by prolonged salvos of ap
plause.
EVENING SESSION.
The Rev. Anna Shaw Is Besieged
With Questions, but Holds Her
Own Right Bravely.
"Sardines in a box" is a very trite com
parison; yet that simile suggested itself
to erery one at last night's session of the
congress.
Miss Anthony was present in a throne
like chair draped with snowy fur. and
looked every inch the queen that she is.
She took occasion to say some very nice
things about The Call, while Miss Shaw
was kept busy answering the strange
queries found in the question -box. There
was only one essay read, but in the opinion
of an enthusiastic admirer it was "worth
twenty."
"Mrs. President and ladies," began
Charles A. Murdock of this City, "and I
think I address this audience so ad
visedly. Heretofore we have been told
that woman embraces man [laughter],
and I have no doubt that a great many of
you since the action of the Republican-Mrs. Henry Krebs Jr., Who Read a Paper Before the Congress Yesterday After
noon on the "Ueroines of History." and Who Is Prominent in This City Both
as a Suffragist and as a Whist-Player.
Convention yesterday feel like embracing
the men."
Then he continued with his subject,
"Onr Foremothers," and spoke in part as
follows:
I feel that In fulfilling your assignment to speak
Of our foremotbers distinctively 1 am invested
with the importance of an epbch-maKer, for I
doubl if in this public manner they have ever been
differentiated from their grim partners. We h;ivt-,
of course, known that we had foremothers, and
from oar knowledge of the permanency of human
nature have felt sure that their virtues were not
less than those that distinguished the fore lat here.
I think it was Beerher who wittingly said that he
felt a great sympathy for the wives of the pilgrim
fathers, since they not only hud to bear all the
privations and sufferings 'hat their husbands did,
but were also oDlieed to bear them.
This must have been no small matter if we read
history aright, for however much we may respect
the adamantine and heroic uprightness of our pro
genitors, we know that unalloyed virote is often
ft trying article to live with, and there are some
historical incidents that throw a powerful search
light on contemporaneous character as revealed
by manners mid customs and confirm this conclu
sion. Think of the public opinion that would en
act and enforce a law by which a man returning j
from a sea voyage who kissed his wife on his own
doorsteps was put in the stocks ior "lewd and un
seemly conduct on the babbatti. ' Here was a
sailor, who, after his kind, had a heart. Fortune |
brought him home on Sunday, but his straight- i
laced neighbors inflicted an Ignominious punish
ment for an act that ought to be uncontrollable.
< 'ne gains entrance into good society of the early
part of the seventeenth century when he is intro
duced to John Winthrop and' his household. A.
fine sample of a Puritan gentleman, pious after the
manner of his time and class, his piety was not
the conventional veneering of a hard mid sour na
ture, but a vital part of a genuine man. Marriage
was not deferred in those clays to the period of
bald heads, when the attractions of the club began
to pal. The future Governor na> but 17 years
and 3 months old when he led to the altar a bride
of 21. 1 would not be understood as commending
quite so early a launch on the matrimonial sea. or
even to hold up for emulation the bravery of a boy
who would dare to marry a woman. We have no
doubt deteriorated in s nic respects, but I am glad
. to think that in this important relation the woman
of to-day has attained a sense of the fitness of
things that precludes such matches.
Their married life was happy, however, which
la, after all. the main thing. John wrote of her as
'â¢a riirhi jrodly woman," and her four children rose
up and called her blessed.
Of his second wile, Thomasine, who. lived but a
year and a day atter her marriage, John Winthrop
wrote: "She wÂ«.s a woman wise, modest, loving
and patient of injuries. StM was truly religious
and industrious therein; plain-hearted and free
from guile, and very humb:e-minded; never so
addicted to any outward things (in my judgment)
but that she could bring her affections to sloop to
God's will in them."
Of Margaret Winthrop, the thirl wife, we (tain a
good knowledge And a high opinion through her
letters and those of others who knew her. The
sturdy Puritan found in her a veritable helpmeet,
and the love that each bore the other, so Quaintly
expressed in their letters, mad" thtir conjugal re
â¦ation ideal. Allowance must be made for form of
expression, but happy is the man of any age who
can inspire such affection and respect as breathes
through her somewhat formal epistles, and per
haps happier stiil the woman who feels them as
the central joy of her life.
Margaret reveals her deep religious nature when
nhe places the love of Uod In her husband before
the loving Of her. I ft-ar that both our forefathers
and our forerr.o'.hers far surpassed us in this stead
fast allegiance to God, with its consequent self
surrender.
Lucy Hutchison, another Puritan woman, ex
presses high ideas Of this supreme love of God in
describing her own husband's love. "He loved
LÂ«*r better than his life, with inexpressible tender
ness and kindness, had a most obliging esteem of
her. yet coDÃtdered honor, religion and duty above
her." There is no cant in this. It is the genuine
outflow of the religious nature. There is a rare
mobility In these consecrated women. They were
more than content tha: honor, duty and religion
should be first. When one feels how deep and
true was their piety one can see ilia severity and
narrowness were merely a fashion of the. hour and
the result of prevailing methods of thought, ihey
were borne on the current and did not retard it.
Were there no special records of the doings of
our foremothers, had none of their letters come
rtown to us. we might safely have concluded that
their lives bore about the same relation to those of
our forefathers that the wives Of to-day do to
their husbands'. Of this we have also direct testi
mony, a traveler in America wrote in 1746 to
the London Magazine: "The women are very
handsome in general, and most notable house
wives; everything wears the marks of cleanliness
and industry in their houses, and their behavior
to their husbands and families is very edifying."
If this Is not equally true in 1896 so much the
worse for ' 96. Ihe traveler goes on to say: '-Girls
under such good mothers generally have twice the
sense and discretion of the boys."
Women in the earlier days were less to the fore.
Some of them were slaves ana some of them were
dolls, but not a few were strong and masterful,
and then, as now, capable of taking care of them
selves, and also of giving good advice and valuable
assistance to their husbands. I think we are in
clined to#give too little cronlt to the business
ability of the women of the olden times and to
picture all our foremothers as simply domestic.
A CREDIT TO THE CITY.
Many of them were, no doubt, hard-working
drudges, snubbed by unappreci.iiive husbands:
but there were many forerunners of the great
army of workers who now occupy soimnortant a
place in the world of affairs.
In 1701 one Elizabeth Haddon, an English girl
of 19, whose father had become possessed of a
tract of land in New Jersey, came alone to the
colony and managed her land with fine judgment
and discretion, founding a town that took her
name. She married a Quaker later, but evidently
because she wanted to and not because she was
obliged to. Iv Pennsylvania, ilary Tewer. the
widow of a Huguenot, took up 2500 acres of laud
and cultivated it successfully.
The thriving town of Taunton, Mass., was
founded by an ancient maiden of 48 years. The
number of women successful as printer* and pub
lishers o# papers is quite remarkable. Mrs. Sarah
(â¢oi'ilanl conducted the only paper in Providence,
H. 1., before 1775, and her daughter was the prin
cipal manager of the Maryland Journal, as well as
Postmistress of Baltimore. \N idows had a way of
carrying on the business left by the husband.
From 1767 to 1775 Ann Katherine Green published
the Maryland Gazette and did the printing for the
colony.
Women were often prominent in public affairs.
The letters of Key. John Pavenport of New Haven
show that his capable wife not only managed his
household, but almost wholly conducted the busi
ness affairs of Governor John Wlni hrop Jr. Now
And then a woman made herself felt and heard in
a way that reminds us afresh that there is "noth
ing new nnder the sun."
we certainly err if we picture our foremothers
as wholly absorbed in their manifold household
duties. Not only did thoy take n not nnimnortant i
ran in the matter* of business, hat they felt and
expressed a strong interest in p.ibllc affairs. In
the later colonial days they weru as spirited as t lie
men in resenting the tÂ« ranny and injustice of the
mother country. When a woman wears home
span from principle, refusing the more becoming
imported goods, she gives strong proof of her ear
nestness. Not content with this individual pro
test the women formed patriotic bands â the first
women societies in America â and pledged them
selves vo diinlc no more taxed British tea. These
'â â¢laughters of liberty" were numerous in New
England; 300 mistresses of families in Boston
signed the compact. When they met they some
times spun ail day for the public benefit; at one
meeting seventy linen wheels were employed.
The same buzzing may be heard when women
meet to-day, yet they "toll not, neither do they
spin." If they have wheels, they leave them out
side, though calumniators aver that there are those
â¢who carry them in their heads. Women did more
than meet and spin. There were instances of very
effective public speaking. Speech was not to say
free in those days, for the frequent use of the cleft
stick and tlied uclt lng-stool were rather strong hints
that it was no: judicious to scold in public. It is
recorded that in Long Island a woman had a clefl
stick placed on her tongue for saying that her hus
band "had brought her to a place where there was
neither gospel uor magistracy, " and in Salem a
woman suffered the same ignominy "for reproach
ing the elders." Let not this severity be charged
exclusively to men. The last woman hanged by
law in Massachusetts was condemned by a Jury of
twelve discreet matrons, and it was found after
her execntion thut the judgment was wrong.
Woman's spirit then as now was not quenched
nor quieted by law or public opinion. Ann
Uutcbinson held weekly meetings In Boston
where sixty or more women listened to her ex
pounding of scripture and the heretical anti

nomian doctrines, and such was her power to stir
up controversy that the whole community was set
by the ears, resulting in a change of government
for the colony. Hne was finally bauUhed, but she
demonstrated the power of the human spirit,
whether it be clothed In a bo ly male or temale.
There were other preachers and reformers who
stirred the people greatly. .Now and then there
was a fraud, the forerunner of our too plentiful
crop of forione-telltTÃ and miscellaneous healers.
Our foremothers we re home-stayers. Travel was
practically unknown. A woman wbo made the
journey from Boston to New Yor.c was the talk of
the colony. Life was generally simple, with few
of the distinctions that now divide us.
In Heber'a "Life of Jeremy Taylor" he remarks:
"In the time of our ancestors the Interval between
the domestic and the other members of the family
was by no means bo gTeat or fenced with so harsh
or impenetrable a barrier as in the present days of
luxury and excessive refinement. The servants
of the manor-house were usually the humble
friends oi the master and mistress, whose play
mates they had been during childhood and under
whose protection they hoped to grow old." In
l'epys' diery we are told mat house servants
joined their mistresses In music; and card-play In*.
In New Kngland there was much tho same inti
macy an<t f quality. Young men and women found
no disgrace in working out. They wtre treat od
kindly and kept the respect of others and their
self-respect.
I am persuaded that wo are generally dispose d
to think of our foremothere as a body of hard
working and austere matrons with few pleasures
and many cares. This probably characterized a
majority, but I am sure if we knew all the facts
we would rind that generalization Is danxerous and
that there were about as many different kinds of
people per huudred then as now.
Une rinds in the historical and biographical frag
ments that are access. ble miiiy accounts ot quite
hilarious merry-makings. The Puritans were no
less demonstrative than the cnvailensli southern
ers, but lam sure that human nature burst out
now and then, if only in the mild dissipation of a
corn-husk i use. and that on the sly the singers in
the church Choir indulged in the gentle filiations
that still stigmatize them. The rashion of the
time modifies expression, but the feelings of the
heart are permanent forces. Not all our Puritan
ancestors were severe of aspect nor stiff in de
meanor. We catch glimpses of roguish fun among
the eirls and rather rough humor among the Doys.
We may take courage In thinking that some of our
ancestors sat in the stocks.
There Is one regard in which our foremothers
were wiser in their day and generation Lhan many
of their descendants. They seem to have kept
very close to their children. There is great peril
In the neglect that often comes with wealth and
luxury. The woman who must take care of her
children does bo. Many tnere are whose love is
strong, wbo are wise enough to care for their chil
dren personally when they are not obliged to. But
tnere are others, and I fear many, who are fond of
ease, or who are slaves SO society, who leave to
ignorant, coarse-natured uursecirl* ihe intimate
companionship and care of their children.
In judging of our foremothers we can hardly
give too Hiuoh importance to the changed condi
tions of life brougnt about by the inventions now
in daily use. The housekeeper of to-day is a
changed person necessarily. The Puritan mother
must have had full days. An interesting hour
might be spent In recouutiug her duties, i hink of
the daily food as related to its source of supply,
now and then. Recall the brick oven with its
bread and beans and myriads of pies. The barrels
of carefully corned beef or pork, the patiently
smoked bacon, the humble sausage, the firkins of
hard-churned butter, the odorous cheese, the few
vegetables coaxed from tne stony heart of the
garden, the jams and preserves.the dried apples.the
tearful onlona, the pkKlis.the sauce, the b.ackberry
wive, the cider, the beerâ all of which her hand
had prepared or her care had directed. Think of
the horrors of tryinz lard, running candles and
making soap! Consider the monthly wash-day
and the home-made starch !
Turn then to clothing, trace the burred and un
clean wool from the back of a sheep to the back oi
a boy; or worse yet, the obdurate nax with Its rot
tings and rinsings and scrapings, its heckling and
spinning and untold bleaching until it became the
ancestral table-cioth, now go prized and priceless.
Think of a house without a sewing machine, with
out a bathtub, or gas, or electricity, or even coal
oil, with no dumb-waiters or speaking-tubes, nor
furnaces, nor telephones. Think of a foremotner
sleeping on a bed filled with fesihers picked from
the reluctant breast of a home-raised goose, cov
ered by a marvelous quilt of her own device and
construction, in a room carpeted by a fabric made
from her own rags by her own hand, rising at the
crowing of a cock she hnd nursed from egghood, to
undertake the never-ending duties of her house
hold, rewarded sometimes with a grumbling of an
unreasonable man. but sometimes, thank God, sus
tained by the love of a husband of equal virtue and
courage.
And these women and these men met their life
tincompla ningly and bore well their part. They
lived ana loved and attended to their own affairs.
ALWAYS THE FAMILY PAPER.
They worked hard, played little, were true to their \
consciences. They thought more of their duties
than they did of their rights. They were not
uabamefl to raise large families, and they raised
them well. I honor a grandfather who spent his
forty years of married life In the house he built oc
his father's lana and supported his tamily on a
farm of twenty acres, supplemented by his labor
M a trade, transmitting an Inheritance of honor to
the six children who grew to maturity and bearing
with patient resignation the iosi of Â«ix who were
taken from them. Not less do I honor my grand
mother, who In all things was his equalâ whose
Kernleness and gooiness, whose faithful devotion
to duty, whose trust In God made his life blessed
and stretches down through the generations in
benediction on me and mine.
When we reflect that the energy and activity
necessary to sustain life In the time of our fore
mothers has been set free through the changed
conditions of to-day, and being imperishable must
rind Dew modes of expression, we do not wonder
that there has been a movement of woman look
ing to fuller economic and political participation
in the common life. There Is no question but a
woman who has a home owe.i it her lirst and beÃt
powers. If a woman neglects her home or her
children for any othur pursuit or occupation she
wioDgs herself, giving up that which Is highest for
that which is lower. It la an exercise of that privi
lege of choice given for our moral education and
must bring the inevitable penalty that iollows any
transgression of law.
If the emancipation of woman is carried so far
that it takes her from her natural life, it paaÂ«es
from gain to degradation. The bars set by uo<l for
the welfare of his creatures may not be tran
scended. They are merciful, not cruel. The lion
may not fly, the lark may not swim, but each has
ncope for fullest possible life within its limitations.
The woman who tries to be more than a woman
only succeeds in oeing less than a woman.
On the other hand there has been unending
twaddle about the sphere of woman, and an
assumption that because woman is theque B nof
the home and the mother of children that she has
no right to do anything else but stay at home, and
that if she does anything else than bear children
she is nnsexed. Now, it must be borne In mind
that there are women, not a few, who have no
homes and have no children. It may not be their
fault: some of them are widows, some of them
would be widows or wives if the husbands they
might have won had not been killed in the war
and consequently never met them.
In some instances it may be the fault of the
croaking bachelors who know so much about
woman theoreticallyâ either that they never gave
them a chance to be wives, or that they were not
worth the taking when they gave them the chance.
Many of the noblest and most womanly women In
the world are unmarried. .Shall they be told that
they have no other vocation than homemakers
and mothers? Again there are many married
women who are quite equal to discharge faithfully
every duty of wife and mother, who have Urge
margins of time and ability.
The surplus energy must be used in some way,
and if turned into proper channels it may do much
to help the State. The last generation chrocheted
and turned out much fancy work that, like some
men, was fearfully and wonderfully made, but of
no manner of use or ornament.
If the women of to-<lay prefer to study sociology
and political economy and b.- organization can in
duce Supervisors to give us good sewers, or school
directors to ventilate the rooms where onr chil
dren are beiug poisoned, who Is to say they are
exceeding their priv'leges? And going a step far
ther, is there an/ just reason why a woman who
wants to vote should not have the privilege? I
feel that the practical value of the franchise will
be small compared with the expectations of those
who ask for It, but that is no argument against
their right to rind out for themselves.
I have a hope that this step will, either in its
success or its failure, tend to settle this eternal
woman question. I confess to being somewhat
weary of It. A woman once praised Starr King for
what he had done to break down the barriers be
tween the sexes. Hue meant the sects. I think
the reformer the world now waits for is the one
that this Partlnglonian accidentally hit. There Is
too much sex distinction, too much agitation of
the difference, too much trumped-up antagonism,
too much ridicule of the one and railing at the
other. Let us have peace. Let us realize that
both are human beings, with possible souls, and
that this likeness far exceeds any difference.
Han, the inclusive man, is a moral being, whose
highest life springs from and ends in love. God
loves his children, and lie has made it possible for
them to rise to love of him through love of one
another. In the breast of man he planted love of
woman. In the breast of woman he planted love
of man. There Is no natural division on the line
of sex. There is natural union.
What God bas Joined together, let neither man
nor woman dare to put asunder. [Great applause. ]
Miss Agnes Manning differed from the
ALWAYS IN ADVANCE.
speaker in one sentiment he had ex
pressed. She said:
"While admiring the paper very much I
was thinking that for 150 years there was
not a school in all New England where a
woman could learn to write, and conse
quently we have no diaries of those times.
The records of the courts in old New Eng
land show that nine-tenths of the women
made their marks."
But Mr. Murdock interposed and ex
plained that tho women of that time were
not illiterate, but, contrary to reputation,
could spell as well as the men of that
time, whatever that may stand lor.
Mrs. Andrews of Los Angeles said she
bad heard of a man in Hatfield, Mass.,
whose boys were all deformed â "that is,
they were girls." He tried to get them
into the grammar school, but the School
Trustees refused them admission. The
girls, however, secured an education by
hook or crook, and one of them lived to
found a famous female academy in the
very town where the fountains of learning
had been closed to her.
Judge E. V. Spencer of Las sen County,
who has been so gallant a lieutenant in
the woman's fight at Sacramento, was said
to be in the audience. He was called to
the platform and said :
"Upon my honor I did not expect to be
called upon to-night. I just thought I
would steal in here to-night and hear all
the good things said on behalf of the
cause of gaining for women her God-given
right.
"I have seen the young man start out in
life led on from step to step up the ladder,
and he was climbing all the time nearer to
greatness and nearer to honor, and at the
same time 1 have seen obstacles put in the
way of his sister.
"I have heard it said that patriotism
was becoming weaker in the mansions of
the rich and losing its force in the cottage
of the poor. There will be a change when
the mothers are given their recognition of
equality with men.
"That victory of yesterday at Sacra
mento was not a matter of a few or a fac
tion, it was a great, unanimous victory for
woman suffrage.
"There was just one man who voted the
other way. Ido not know what I thought
about that man, but he seemed to me the
smallest thing on earth as he stood alone
before that groat congress and puled out
his pitiful 'No.' "
The question box was then opened and
Miss Shaw took the center of the stage aa
the oracle to be consulted.
"THE CALL" WAS FIRST.
1527 Polk Street, San Francisco.
To the Editor of The Call:
You have done nobly in so grandly espousing the cause of
woman's enfranchisement. The day will come, and in the not far
distant future, when you will say with pride, "The Call was the
first daily of San Francisco to champion the cause of woman."
The men and women of the coming generation will rise up and
call you blessed. My congratulations may be a-little late, but my
exultation was early and earnest and should have found expres
sion before, but the labors of the week at Sacramento as a Re
publican and suffragist is my excuse, and now that the victory
won was so complete 1 more than rejoice and know that the glor
ious stand The Call has taken in behalf of woman's freedom
had the effect of bringing the other dailies into line, and with
such a trio entering the homes of all California, educating the
masses â for that is the province of our papers â what cannot they
accomplish ? All honor to The Call.
Nellie Holbrook Blinn,
Vice-President State Suffrage Association.
Thursday, May 7, 1896.
"The questions are generally along tho
same lines," began Miss Shaw. "Proba
bly because you women are all of the same
mind. If we eouhl get the sinners here !
"I was in the car the other evening
wben one woman remarked to another,
'There's Miss Shaw,' 'Where?' asked her
companion. 'Over there in the corner. I
guess she's been at the Woman's Con
gress.'
" 'Have you been there?' whispered the
other.
" 'Naw,'
"'Going?'
" 'Naw.'
" 'Well, I'd like to go.' concluded the
questioner, 'but I'd be ashamed of my
life to be seen in that company.' "
"What should a woman do, what would
a woman feel, locked up with eleven men
| in a police station?" was .one of the ques
i tions.
"That is not a new question in this
State," answered Miss Shaw: "it seems to
| be worrying all you men. The question
! is never asked what would one man do if
locked in a cell with eleven women."
"Now, Senator Ingalls is an admirable
man; he paits his hair directly in the
middle, but he pafts his figures on the
side and will not equalize them."
A question in a lady's handwriting asked
for a reply to a man who objected to
woman suffrage since it would unduly in
crease the number ol voters.
"It is a mistake to have too many
voter?," Miss Shaw answered. "But we
cannot have too many good voters. Op
ponents of this movement say there are
over 3,000,U00 illiterate women who would
vote if allowed. Let them vote say I.
Whether they vote right or wrong there
are 12,000,000 intelligent women who will
neutralize any ill effects which the in
considerate voting of tUe ignorant women
may cause.
"Would women not be too extravagant
in the affairs of Government? I think we
would be. The only reason we have not
pressed our claims before is on account of
the economic administrations. Every mar
ried man knows that his wife can run their
house on about half as much money as be
could run the kitchen. Men are used to
buying by wholesale. You couldn't send
out a man to buy two chops, one artichoke
and a few vegetables.
"No, women will not lay themselves lia
ble to insult in campaigns any more than
they do now in going down the street.
And why? Simply because under both
circumstances they will meet the very
same men. In all my experience in cam
paigning I was never treated with more
courtesy by men than I was with my fel
low-workers yesterday at the Sacramento
convention.
"Why was the referendum a failure in
Boston"? They never had any referendum
in Boston ; it was a sham. It was simply
to make women a laughing stocK. Of the
ballots that were cast 95 per cent were in
favor of woman suffrage. And ttien men
said, 'Look at the overwhelming number
of women in Massachusetts that don't
want the ballot.' "
Miss Shaw read amid much laughter an
ill-spelled and worse composed challenge
to herself from ft Los Angeles man to a
public debate on the question of "wimen
sufferag." She omitted to state whether
she intended taking up the "gage," but she
intimated that she was just a trine afraid
of so formidable an adversary.
"How are the expenses of the campaign
to be met? Will Miss Anthony answer that
question?"
"My dear friends," began Miss Anthony,
"the expenses of this campaign are to be
met just as the expenses of campaigns
have been met elsewhere â by friends of
the movement contributing. Now, I ap
peal to you, every one of you here to
night, tocontribute your mite, be it little
or great. It is your duty.
"I used to be told: 'Miss Anthony, you
should not attempt this until you get the
funds.' If I had never done anything until
I had the money in hand I should never
have accomplished anything. I might
say that the greatest deeds I have ever at
tempted were begun without money in
hand.
"Tf the history of my experience were
recorded it would be a story of going in
debt to uudertake different things. Even
after all the parties have put suffrage
planks in their platforms I still want all
you people to contribute funds for the
campaign, for the fight will even then
be only just begun. I want to say to you
a word of encouragement in regard to the
stand of the press of your State.
"Last Sunday, as all of you know, your
grand daily. The Call, came out boldly on
the side of woman suffrage. [Great
applause]. All that I could say would
fall far short of what I ought Â»to say in
grateful recognition of the gracious, noble
position taken by a great journal on a great
issue. Heaven prosper and bless a paper
which stands up for justice and right!
"I want to say to you that it is the first
time in the past twenty-eight years that
either of the great parties has come out
at the tirst of the campaign in indorsing
the woman suffrage movement; the first
time that the dominant party has ever
taken the stand in advance.
"When is your Democratic convention,
June 16? Is that it? Are there nc Demo
crats in this great audience? I want to i
sp? ak of other papers besides The Call. [
The Examiner, while it did not come out i
at first boldly as did The Call, has j
since followed its example; and the
Chronicle, not to be outdone, has, at Mr.
De Young's personal order, offered its
columns henceforth for the cause of
woman suffrage. Now, cheer the morn
ing papers. And I have no doubt the
evening papers have done likewise, but
have not had a chance to see them.
"Now, my dear friends, with the press
on our side. The Call at its head, with
the political parties on our side, with so
many kind soula in sympathy with us,
we must succeed, if we will only work
together and with a will."
Then Miss Shaw resumed her answers:
"In the Utopian era of women-free who
will pay for their bonnets? The women,
as to-day, who earn their bonnets a hun
dred times over for what they do.
"Men say women have been discussing
woman suffrage for the last fifty years and
they are tired of it. Why, men Lave been
discussing themselves from time imme
morial and we women are not tired of
them yet.
"The greatest evil that men suffer in not
permitting women to vote is in being un
just to himself. No human being can be
unjust to another and be just to himself.
I have traveled over Kansas for ten con
secutive years and visited every town
where there were 1200 people, and I can
Bay that as carefully as I have watched
and studied the woman-suffrage move
ment there in all that time I have not been
a place where it was not a success and an
advantage to women."
"How about women's efficiency as
jurors?" ran another question.
"In Washington, when it was a Terri
tory," replied Miss Shaw, "when it was a
Territory, women served on juries. The
Manitoba papers complained that all the
sharks, tramps and sharpers of Washing
ton had been driven over into Manitoba.
That looks as though woman could hold
her own on a jury."
"If woman bad the ballot, would she not
sell her vote for a new bonnet?'
"Perhaps she might. Who knows? A
new bonnet is a fine thing, and most
women hanker after it. But a good bonnet
costs more money than a glass of whisky,
and that, they say, is the market price of
male votes uowadays."
"Here's another question," continued
Miss Shaw, "and I'll answer it, though it's
rather personal: 'You said a home was
offered you in California if you would
stay. Was that all?' [great laughter.] I
answer, it was not all. I was offered as
much good oak wood as I could burn in
my stoves during the remainder of my life.
" 'Some one has said in heaven there will
be no marriages. And how is that?' Well,
it has been said that there could not be, as
there would be no men there.
" 'Will women, if they get the ballot,
stuff the ballot-box?' No; the opportunity
is not given now for stuffing ballot-boxes
as it was. What we mean by the ballot is
not that the ballot will make us absolutely
free; it is simply an implement for onr
use in securing just and equitable laws and
the enforcement of them.
"It is time men were made fun of a lit
tle. For half a century Susan B. Anthony
and great and good men have been held
up to ridicule, sarcasm and cutting satire.
I remember once a Bishop turned the
keen shafts of his ill-timed wit upon the
woman suffrage movement, keeping his
audience in roars of laughter.
"The next night," continued Miss Shaw,
"I held him up before my audience, and
they laughed until they nearly keeled
over. The Bishop reprimanded me se
verely for thus holding him up to ridicuie.
I only answered:
â¢"Bishop, if you are a just man, you
must concede that wit is oftentimes a two
edged sword, and wielded without judg
ment cuts both ways.' "

PRESS CLUB DELEGATES.
C. M. Coe and F. C. Roberts to
Attend the League at
Buffalo.
The Financial Report Shows Only a
Vestige of the Former Debt.
The Big Jinks.
The Press Club held its third quarterly
meeting of the year last night, the object
being to hear the reports of the various
committees and elect delegates to the Na
tional League of Press Clubs, which meets
at Buffalo, June 3. Some time since the
club renewed its membership with the
League of Press Clubs, from which it with
drew a few years ago, just after the meet
ing of the league here.
The various reports submitted showed
that the club was in a very prosperous
condition. 0. M. Coe, the president of the
club, in some brief opening remarks told
that nine months ago, when the present
administration took hold, the indebted
ness was about $3000. where it was now
only about $1000. He added that now the
club was like a well-oiled machine. Eighty
new members had been admitted and the
club was making plenty of money. The
statement was received with applause.
The club is on June .6 to give a jinks,
probably the greatest ever given by it.
F. S. Myrtle of the entertainment commit
tee told that Superior Judge Hunt would
"sire" the jinks and that excellent club
talent had already been secured. He pre
dicted that the entertainment would sur
pass anything ever before given. Hugh
Hume gave notice that at the next quar
tet ly meeting he would move an amend
ment to the constitution for the admis
sion of members of the business office
other than the heads of departments.
C. M. Coe and F. C. Roberts were then
unanimously elected as delegates to at
tend the annual meeting of the National
League of PresÃ Clubs. The meeting of
club members was large and in all respects
enthusiastic.
HONORS ON THE STAND,
Three Superior Judges Called lo
Testily About Frank
Schilling.
ARE QUESTIONING HIS SANITY.
Judge Coffey Makes Some Caustic Re
marks to the Erratic
Attorney.
Frank Schilling, who has been prepar
ing contempt proceedings for himself by
writing contemptuous letters to and about
Judge Coffey, was before Judge Slack yes
terday on an order to show cause why he
should not be removed from the guard
ianship of Peter Owen Matthews, over
which position the whole fight has been
going on.
Francis Pope, who asked for the cita
tion and who was appointed attorney to
assist the guardian, was present, and he
asked that Judge Coffey and Judge Heb
bard be called. Mr. Schilling, not to be
outdone, asked that Judge Hunt be asked
to attend. Messengers were sent for their
honors, and pretty soon the Judges ar
rived.
Judge Coffey was first examined. He
told how he had appointed Mr. Schilling
as guardian of the estate of Peter Owen
Matthews, an incompetent, on the request
of Matthews himself. Judge Coffey was
then asked what he thought of Schilling
as a guardian, and he said be thought
him eccentric â very eccentric. Schilling's
presence in the courtroom was disgusting
to him, but he had always tried to treat
him properly.
"What'do you think of his knowledge of
the law?" asked Pope.
"I do not like to impugn the judgment
of the Supreme Court," answered the
Judsre. "He was passed there. But I will
say he often, before me, greatly Â«mbar
rassed the actions of tbe court."
After more questions as to Schilling's
method of conducting a case, Judge Coney
was asked what ho thought of the attor
ney's sanity. He said he did not know.
He had not examined an insane person for
years, and so was hardly able to judge.
He thought Schilling eccentric, however,
and would not reappoint him as guardian
of any estate.
Mr. Schilling then took a hand and com
menced to cross-examine.
"Do you base your opinion of me on
that letter?" he began.
"Partly," replied the Judge. "That let
ter was a reprehensible effusion, grossly
personal and elaborately faise."
"Did you not break your promise to me
as your brother attorney in not being in
Judge Hebbard's court, where you said
you would meet me?"
â¢'You are not my brother attorney in the
first place," said hi.-i Honor quietly. "I
was in Judge Hebbard's court waiting
fully ten minutes, and then I had to go
back to attend to my own business."
"Could you tell what ten minutes it was
â ten minutes to 2â2 o'clock?"2 â 2o'clock?"
"I have made my statement, Mr. Schil
ling. "
"But are you sure it was ten minutes?"
"I have made my statement, Mr. Schil
ling," repeated the Judge with some em
phasis, "and if you say anything else it is
false- If you are sworn and then make
any different statement you wili be com
mitting perjury."
Schilling; made a short apology for
writing the letter which caused all the
trouble, and Judge Coffey gave place to
Judge Hebbard.
' Judge Hebbard was called as an expert
on insanity, for every second month the
insanity commission meets before him.
Judge Hebbard described Schilling's ac
tions while trying a case before him. He
said Schilling was excited. Judge Hunt
was also called in for an opinion by Schill
ing and then followed a number of the
attorney's friends.
The case was taken under advisement.

HOW IT WORKS IN NEW YORK.
- Henry Clews' New York circular says: "In do
mestic conditions there are some distinct improve
ments. The distributing trade shows more activity,
and the tendency of prices in many kinds of mer
chandise is toward higher figures. Crop reports
show more recovery from Che unfavorable condi
tions with which the spring opened than has been
hoped for. The earnings of the railroads continue
comparatively good and freight rates are well
. maintained. The feeling among manufacturers is
somewhat more hopeful. The process of forming
combinations for the regulation of com netilion is ex
tending from one industry to another and promises
to place the current of , overproduction under
wholesome restraint. The excitement connected
with preparations for the political conventions can
hardly be said to have taken any deep hold on
Wall street."

CHICAGO MAKKKTS.
CHICAGO, . 111, May 7.â Chinch-bug stories
from Kansas gave the wheat market an upward
tendency to-day. Dispatches reporting the appear
ing of the pest were numerous and the trade was
in a mood to accept the reports as veracious. St.
Louis was the center from which the stories were
circulated and that town sent in a. lot of buying
orders. Showers in the Rea River Valley were
likewise alluded to in a casual way, the informa
tion from that quarter being a trifle contradictory
as to the importance of the rainfall,' however.
Initial transactions in the pit were at easy prices.
Fine-growing weather, a rather encouraging sum
mary by the Cincinnati Price Current and barely
steady Liverpool cables, were .the Items on which
the early-selling movement was founded. '
||The ,bng stories reversed the tone, however, and
shorts covered with a moderate amount of free
dom. Receipts to-day were five cars at Chicago
and 271 in the Northwest. Last Thursday Minne
apolis and Duluth had 290 cars and a year ago
160. Local inspections from store amounted to
67,426 bushels. Export clearances amounted to
125, "00 bushels. Closing Continental cables were
generally lower. Hot winds In - Kansas were add
ed to the bull arguments before the close and
prices advanced further on that news. July wheat
openHi at 62% c, sold at 6214 c. advanced to and
closed at 64c, l^c higher than yesterday. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow ten cars.
CORN- The chinch bugs did not make a direct
attack on corn, but the. price of the cereal was
nevertheless affected by the expected ravages.
Wheat having advanced, corn, in the spirit of
good fellowship, could not do otherwise than sym
pathize. Nothing of interest transpired and trud
ng was light. Receipts were 156 cars and 185.000
bushels were withdrawn from store. Liverpool
cables were quiet and steady. The Cincinnati
Price Current reported the corn crop as making
good progress.' Export clearances were good at
331,142 bushels. July corn opened at 295/& C, ad
vanced to and closed at 30i4fÂ»30Â»/gc, %@3/ic
higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts lor
to-morrow, 150 cars.
OATSâ dlspa ches relative to bugs from
Kansas stated they were also eating the oats. This
news, in conjunction with the strength of wheat,
served to strengthen the tone of this market. The
Cincinnati Price Current mentioned that growing
oats were getting along well. Receipts were 128
cars : and ' 218,218 bushels were taken from store.

strength of the grain markets sufficed to sustain
prices and no very serious depreciation took place.

elegant home of Hon. and Mrs. E. L.
Briegs, on Eleventh street, to meet Mrs.
Rose Hartwick Thorpe and her husband.
Mrs. Thorpe is known the world over as
the author of "The Curfew Must Not Ring
To-night."
In response to many requests Mrs.
Thorpe told the guests how the well-known
poem came to be published. "I was nnly
16 years old when I wrote it," she said,
"and at that time I had no thought of
publishins: it. I put it away and did not
think anything more about it for three
years. It was in the autumn of 1870 that I
came across the forgotten 'Curfew' and I
cent it to a Detroit editor with an apology.
Some days later he sent me a letter stat
ing that tne little piece was destined to
make my fame as a writer. For a long
time it was printed and reprinted, but
without my name. It was attributed by
some to Tennyson, by others to Longfel
low, and finally I took steps to credit the
poem to the one who wrote it. I never
got anything for it except the $10 which 1
received for the manuscript."
Among other numbers Mrs. Thorpe re
cited her now famous poem. She said
that there is another verse that has never
been printed, but as it is copyrighted she
is not at liberty to give it for publication.
Mrs. Thorpe is a very enthusiastic
worker for women's suffrage. "1 believe
heartily in it." she said. "In the first
place it is right, and in the end right will
prevail. I, and thousands of other women
in this State, and, I may say, men, whom
I have met recently, are all united in con
gratulating The Call on the stand it has
taken in the matter. The time has come
when the women are bound to be granted
the riulit to represent themselves, and a
great daily paper that prasps the situation,
as one has already done, is simply show
ing a foresight that cannot be too highly
commended.
"It requires a great display of courage
to adopt a policy such as The Call has
adopted. The Republican party of this
State made no mistake when they inserted
the woman's suffrage plank in their plat
form."
In the large reception hall was displayed
the magnificent jeweled banner given to
Mrs. Thorpe at the World's Fair. It was
presented in the Michigan building by the
women of that State and contains thirty
jewels, while gold and silver are lavishly
used. There is an oil portrait of the au
thor and a scene suggested by the poem
on the banner. The whole is a beautiful
work of art.
CLASS DAY EXERCISES,
Secrets of To-Day's Programme
at the University Kept
Inviolate.
Dr. John Watson's Lecture on Idealism.
Preparing for the San Jose
Game.
BERKELEY. Cal., May 7.â President
Wyckoff of the senior class at the uni
versity announced this afternoon the pro
gramme of exercises for class day, which
will fall on next Saturday.
The committee in charge refuses to
divulge the nature of the performances
which are to take place in the amphi
theater in the afternoon and around
which the interest of the day is custom
arily centralized. They merely state that
the performance will not be of such a de- I
eidedly spectacular nature as that of '95,
but that it will be more like the class-day
programmes rendered eight or ten years
ago. "We are going to bring to life some
of the old college customs if we can," said
one of the committee to-day, "but we will
not say what these customs are to be."
In the morning at 10 o'clock addresses
will be given from Founders' Rock, back
of the new Mechanics' building, by Galen
M. Fisher '96 and Dr. S. H. Willey of San
Francisco.
It is remarkable to say that Dr. Willey
is the only surviving "founder" of the
university who stood on the rock the day
it was declared to be the "Founders'
Rock," April 16. IWK). An address from
the rock will also be given by President
Kellogg. Immediately after the closing
of these exercises the class pilgrimage will j
he commenced, when the processional line j
of students will make a tour of all the
buildings on the campus, stopping at In
tervals on their itinerary to listen to short
sneeches from the seniors. At the Chem
istry building Raymond Russ will deliver
an address; at the library Benjamin
Ramsdell will speak, and at ' North Hall
A. V\ . North will make a few remarks.
On their pilgrimage they will be led by the
university brass band. "At the close of the
address of North, the guests will retire to
the Greek-letter fraternity houses and
elsewhere for luncheon.
From 2 until 3 the band will render
an open-air concert under the historic
oakg. At 3 o'clock the performances In
Ben Weed's amphitheater, back of the
Chemistry building, will commence. Presi
dent \v yckoff will open the exercises with
a speech, in which he will tell what his
class has done for the university, what it
has not done and what it propose? to do.
The class history will be read by Witten
meyer, the big football player. Some hu
morous jests and joshes are expected in
this part of the programme if precedent is
carried out. The class prophecy will be
read by Frank Argall, Miss Farnum and
W. D. Thompson. Then tne surprise of
the day will be sprung upon the arrival of
"Farmer Simpkins," evidently the leading
character in a comic show. The entire
senior class will be in uniform costume.
The young ladies will wear white dresses
and the young men white ducks and plugs.
For the Championship.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 7.â The Berke
ley baseball players held their last prac
tice game this afternoon in preparation for
their final meet with Stanford to-morrow
morning at San Jose to determine the
intercollegiate baseball championship for
the season of '96. Flushed witn the signal
victory over the cardinals in last Satur
day's came on the Palo Alto diamond,
they are confident of running up a high
score in to-ruorrow's contest. The players
and a big crowd of "rooters" will leave for
San Jose on the 8:15 narrow-gauge train
from Oakland to-morrow morning.
The final examinations at the univer
sity were practically completed to-day, and
as to-morrow will be free for most of the
students a large number will accompany
their nine to the battle-ground. It was
hoped by Manager Miller that a party of
300 could be secured, as a result of which
a special train would be run and an excur
sion rate of $1 25 be charged. As it is the
students will be privileged to tak<> advan
tage of the carnival rate of $1 60 lor the
round trip. The game wiil be called at
10:30. Following will be the Berkeley
players: Wheeler, catcher; Morden,pitch
er; McLaren, shortstop; Batchelder, right
field ; Elston, captain pro tern. and second
base; Krujj, third base; Proctor, center
field; Hoag, left tmld; Kaarsburg, Bub

Watson on Idealism.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 7.â Dr. John
Watson, the eminent philosopher, gave
the last of his series of four special lectures
before the Philosophical Union of the
State University this evening. The lec
ture was a practical continuation of the
discourse rendered last evening, the sub
ject of which was "A Defense of Intel
lectual Idealism." Considerably more at
tention than last evening was dsvoted,
however, to Â£he matter of discussine the
problems contained in Wauon's book on
"Compte, Mill and Spencer." The dis
cussion was chiefly between Professor
Howjson and Dr. Watson, although other
members of the union participated.
The next public address which Dr. Wat
son will give in Berkeley will be at Har
mon on Tuesday evening, the 12th inst.
The subject for this discourse will be "A
Comparison of the Greek and Christian
Ideas of Life." In speaking of the topic
Dr. Watson said: "First, I will deal with
the philosophy of Aristotle and Plato;
secondly, with Christianity as set forth by
its founder, Christ, as distinguished from
subsequent doctrinal development; and,
thirdly, mediaeval Christianity, as con
trasted with the point of view of modern
thought."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 8, 1896.
WAS MISSING
A DOZEN YEARS,
Samuel McÃrown Returns
a Rich Colombian
Miner.
GIVEN TIP TOR DEAD.
Found by a Solicitor Who
Worked for the Midwinter
Fair Paper.
WAS A WELL-KNOWN LAWYER.
Did Not Notify His Family of His
Going and Cou'.d Not
Write.
Oakland Office Sak Frascisoo Call,)
908 Broadway, May 7. )
Samuel McÃrown, who has been lost to
his friends and family for twelve years, has
returned from Panama, and his coming
back was much of a surprise as his going
away.
A number of years ago Mr. McÃrown
heard of a very rich mining region in the
United States of Colombia, South America.
Without giving any warning he off
to the mines, and nothing more was heard
of him till three months ago.
Letters on both sides failed to reach their
destination, and years went by with anx
iety and unsatisfactory tidings, until the
family believed Mr. McÃrown had been the
victim of some of the dreadful fevers tnat
are so fatal to foreigners in that part of the
country. A little tinge of romance enters
into the story that causes the once happy
family to be reunited.
Mr. McÃrown 's only son established him
self in the publishing business in San
Francisco, and during the Midwinter Fair
published the oflirial organ of the fair.
It required a number of men as solicitors
for advertisements, and among them was
a very intelligent man who bad traveled
the world over and was contemplating a
trip to South America when the fair
closed.
He was told of Mr. McÃrown's family's
anxiety to know if be was in tne land of
the living, and he promised to investigate
the matter thoroughly.
Though they had but little hope the
family was surprised to receive three
months later a letter from Mr. McÃrown,
who had been put into communication
through the American Consul at Panama
with his wife and children.
At the time of writing he was supposed
to be on his dying-bed, dangerously ill
with enlargement of the liver, and, thoutch
thousands of dollars Had been spent for
medical treatment, no relief came. He
wrote that the doctors could not promise
any hope of recovery, and when he sug
gested the trip home predicted, even were
he to recover sufficiently to leave his bed,
the tax of the journey homeward would
kill him and he would be buried in the
Pacific Ocean. Notwithstanding this ad
vice, the thought of once more being home
with his family gave him a strength that
carried him to Panama, and from the
very moment he left there he began to
feel better and to gain strength, which
permitted him to reach home, where the
best physicians that can be procured will
take the case, with a hope of Mr. Mc-
Brown's ultimate recovery.
Mr. McÃrown is closely identified with
the early nistory of California, coming
here in the days of '49 and settling in
Nevada County, where he once owned gold
mines and considerable other property.
He was also one of the pioneer lawyers of
this State, and practiced at Reese River,
in the State of Nevada, where he was as
sociated in business relations with John
Garber of Berkeley.
Of the lew remaining pioneer friends
who are in this city the oldest is Jesse
Wall, ex-Superintendent of Streets, who
was a very intimate acquaintance of Mr.
McÃrown.
For some years his wife and children,
who are all well-known residents of this
city and San Francisco, thought him to be
dead.
The wife who waited so long for new 9of
her absent husband is a well-known Oak
land girl.
Mr. McÃrown while yet a young and
rising lawyer married Miss Louise Hart
man, second daughter of Dr. Hartman, a
prominent physician later of Oakland ami
San Francisco, who at the time of their
marriage was the pioneer fruit-raiser of
Nevada County.
While in Colombia Mr. McÃrown's ven
tures have bean very successful, and he is
row the owner of much valuable property
in that country. A mail very rarely
reaches the place, and to thia the family
attribute their failure to hear from their
father during his long absence.
Mr. McÃrown isÂ«a relative of ex* Go
vernor Eli H. Murray of San Dieeo and
John McÃrown, a Sacramento Supervisor.

OAKLAND, Cal., May 7.â The enumer
ation of children in this city has been

Company 6.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. May 7.â The sequel
to the absence of the major portion of
Company G, which oupht to have paraded
for battalion drill on Monday night, was

BATTLE OF THE BRIDGE,
Eighth Street Closed to Citi
zens but Open to a
Railroad.
INSOLVENCY AN ADVANTAGE.
To Close Up the Tracks Would Place
the City in Contempt of
Conrt
Oakland Office Sas Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 7. )
Eighth-street bridge was clo.^ed this
afternoon, and the public was bereft of
one of the only two highways connecting
East Oakland with Broadway.
The tracks of the electric road are open,
and that corporation has, therefore, a
privilege that is denied citizens. The road
is in tbe hands of a receiver, and to touch
its property would be contempt of court
and would immediately cause an injunc
tion to issue.
The whole matter is the result of the
deadlock between Mayor Davie and Street
Superintendent Miller. The latter claims
that he can get no requisitions for ma
terials needed to repair the bridge from
the Mayor's office and that it is in such a
dangerous condition that the city will be
caught in a big damage suit if it is not
closed. The Council took this view of the
situation, and ordered the Street Super-
intendent to fence the street up to the car
track and request the receiver to close the
balance.
Mayor Davie declares the whole thing is
a political job. He declares that he has
never refused to allow lumber for thÂ«Â»
brdge--thai in fact no such requisition
had ever been presented to him. The
Mayor threatened that if the Superiuten-
I dent attempted to carry out the orders of
the Council he would go down himself and
tear tbe obstruction .town and would even
arrest the Superintendent for violating the
law by blocking a public street.
Superintendent Miller, however, took a
force of men this afternoon and closed the
street, except that portion occupied by the
electric road.
Mayor Davie to-night said :
"I shall take a force of men in the morn
ing, go down to the bridge and repair it
j and then remove the obstructions placed
j there to-day by Miller. The whole thing
is a political job. The bridge only needs
! a few boards on the flooring and it will do
until the contractors begin to rebuild it
next month. There have been thousands
of dollars allowed for the corporation yard,
but where does it go. No requisition has
been made for lumber to repair the bridge.
If he wants lumber for any specific pur
j pose I will sign the requisition, but I will
never sign one for lumber to go into the
corporation yard, so that it can be carried
home to be made into chicken coops and
fences for private indiviuuals."
ALAMEDA'S BIG VICTORY.
Judge Greene Decides for the
City After* Fifteen Years'
Delay.
Municipal League Meeting â Delanoy
Not Arrested Yetâ Floral Fete.
Company G.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 7.â After more
than fifteen years of weary litigation and
endless de lays the city has come by its
own. Railroad avenue ends at Park
street, and its continuation after the in
tersection is known as Lincoln avenue.
To open this street eastward to High
street through the famous Cohen property
has been the desire of successive Boards of
Trustees. To-day it has been made possi
ble, as Judge Greene dissolved the primary
injunction with costs against Mrs. Emily
G. Cohen, and the city authorities are now
able to proceed without fear of any re
straining order.
The Folea Not Up Yet.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 7.â A1l day long
Old Glory spread itself to the breeze
over the Central block. All day long at j
the foot of Chestnut street and Clement ,
avenue a posthole remained open. They
were both the act of the much-talked- j
about F. N. Delanoy. The import of the I
latter's action was distihet and unmistak
able. His visor was closed and tuegage!
thrown down. The city authorities
ascribed the unfurling of the flag to the
enunciation of a local Monroe doctrine.
Mr. Delanoy said the flag might be said to !
represent jewelry, the consistency being
wanting. He had dug the hole, informed
the Street Superintendent of his action,
waited for two hours at the hole to be ar
rested and at last begged to be arrested, as
the city authorities had notified him would
be done. But they would not arrest. The
city is going to content itself with pulling
up the poles as soon as they are inserted.
This afternoon neither the City Attorney
nor Counsel Bruner had decided on th<-ir
future action. One is simply waiting for
the other. So far no poles have been set
up. They are reposing in the mud of the
estuary.
Point* of Interest.
ALAMEDA. Cal., May 7.â The argu
ments on the law of the gambling cases in

A Notary Public.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 7. â William
Holtz, notary public at the West End, has
had suit brought against him in the Su
perior Court. The plaintiff is John Gooby,
and he seeks to recover the sum of $5750 as
damages. The whole question turns on
the abandonment of a homestead and the
signature thereto. Gooby says the certifi
cate of acknowledgment is false, fraudu
lent and a forgery. He transferred his
equity in the homestead to his wife, from
whom he was estranged. Mrs. Gooby bor
rowed $5000 on the property on the
strength of the certificate of abandonment.
Her husband says he has spent $750 to
clear his title and asks for $5000 additional
as damages.

Bella and La Mascota. Opening in the
betting at 15 to 1, he was grad ually played
down until sixes was about the best ob
tainable as the horses went to the post.
Summertime opened a 6 to 5 choice, reced
ing to 8 to 5, equal odds wi th Yankee
Doodle, who was backed down, from 3 to 1.
When the barrier flew up J ohnson bent
Peixotto out in front, opening up a gap of
four lengths. Summertime s rider was
taking it easy, waiting for Yankee Doodle,
who was supposed to be the contending
horse, but he died away under a wrap.
When too late Summertime set sail for the
outsider, but could not quite get up, and
wiis beaten out half a length in 1:14^.
La Ma3cota came fast at the end, being
lapped on the place horse as the wire was
passed.
J. Robbins' old horse Oregon Eclipse
captured the opening six-furlong run,
starting an 8 to 5 favorite. Shields took
matters easy until the stretch was reached,
when he made his run and passed the
judges a very handy winner with the 30 to
1 s>hot O'Fleeta finishing in the place.
Irma was> a good third.
The Lone stable's Dunooy carried the
bulk of the coin bet on the starters in the
four-furiong scramble for two-year-olds.
From 212 to 1 he was backed down to 11 to
5, with Lovelight next in demand at 3.
The favorite made all of the running and,
ridden out, passed the stand three-parts of
a length before Scarborough in 4& seconds,
an excellent run.
Twelve ordinary selling-platers lined up
at the post in the fourth race, over six fur
longs, with Belle Boyd ruling a 2 to 1
choice at the close. She never cut much
figure and finished unplaced. Heartsease,
with 8 to 1 about her in the ring, headed
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 8, 1896.
the fie'd after turning into the stretch and
won very easily by two lengths, with Sea
Spray in the place, three lengths in front
of Gold Bug.
There was considerable more class to
the eisht starters that faced the barrier in
the race following at seven furlongs.
After reaching 13 to 5 the Corrigan entry,
Olive, was backed down to a 2 to 1 favor- \
ite. Rev del Bandidos was a well backed |
second choice, but ran like a cow. The 30
to 1 outsider Afflatus, was leading as the
stretch was reached and it looked for a
while as though the Montana mare was
auain going to tumble in overlooked.
Olive headed her, however, in the final
spurt and beat the despised one out a
length in 1:28k. Major Cook, the third
choice, finished in the show.
Millionaire Walter Hobart's big chest
nut held sway in the bettine on the staEes
in the final race, also over seven furlongs,
going to the post 8 to 5. Overhauling
Midas below the furlong pole from home, !
he scampered in an easy winner, with j
Midas in the place, a length and a bait
before the second choice, Joan.
TRACK AND PADDOCK ITEMS.
Zeke Abrahams yesterday disposed of
imp. The Judge to A. B. Spreckels for
$2000. The Judge is a bay horse, 5 years
oid, by the English stallion Loyalist, and
will be retired for stud duty at Mr.
Spreckels' breeding establishment at Xapa.
During his racing career the dam of the
big bay has been siven as British Queen,
which is said to be an error.
The preat three-cornered match race on
Wednesday next between Fleur de Lis,
Orestes and George Palmer has evoked
great interest among racegoers, and
already Fleur de LiÃ is touted as a "lead
pipe." Good things, however, sometimes
crawl, and an old farmer at a country fair
was once heard to remark, as he mopped
his sweated brow after viewing a finish in
which the horse he bet on won by a
whisker. " 'twain no cinch."

A BLOW AIMED
AT SUTRO'S LINE
Market-Street Company Is
After the Sutter-Street
System.
MORROW WOULD SELL.
Buckley and Schmitt Also Said
to Be Willing to
Get Out.
TRANSFER CONTRACT HOLDS.
The Mayor Says It Will Stand If a
Dozen Changes Take
Place.
The fight is still on between Mayor Sutro
and the "octopus," and in the next round,
pugilistically expressing it, the "octopus"
will be on the agressive.
Though known to a few it is not quite
an open secret that the Market-street Rail
way Company has long had its eye on the
Sutter-street line. In years past the com
pany would have drawn a large draft on
its treasurer to possess itself of the sys
tem, but since the construction of the
Sutro line and the incidental combine
entered into between the Mayor and the
Sutter-street company, tne covetousness
of the "octopus" in that direction has
been greatly stimulated.
Thereby hangs the tale. If the Market
street company could gain control of the
Sutter-street system and shut off Mayor
Sutro's feeder a severe blow would be dealt
the arch enemy of the "octopus."
Until a few weeks ago, so the story runs,
these aspirings on the part of the "octo
pus' were vain, shapeless and without
promise. But there came a brightening
on the horizon of Southern Pacific hopes.
A climax was approaching in the deal be
tween Robert Morrow, the heaviest stock
holder in the Sutter-street company, and
D. O. Mills. Mr. Morrow was pushed for
ready capital to carry on his mining op
erations in Nevada. He. applied to D. O.
Mills, the well-known millionaire. Mr.
Mills was willing. He knew the Sutter
street railway was good property, and he
so told his friend, Mr. Morrow. The latter
saw the point, and no time was lose in
negotiating the loan so much needed.
Mr. Morrow transferred his interest in
the Sutter-street company to Mr. Mills in
exchange for a few hundred thousand,
and the money and Mr. Morrow hurried
off to the mines.
In such transactions it is next to impos
sible to get at the actual facts, but as near
as can be learned the conditions on which
the loan was made were that in rÂ°nt the
loan was not repaid the Morrow interest
in the Sutter-street Company should pass
into the hands of Mr. Mills at the expira
tion of a specified time. The knowing
ones say that the time elapsed several
weeks ago and now Mr. Mills is in a posi
tion to dispose of his interest in the Sutro
line's feeder to the "octopus.*' 1
Additional color and probability are given
to the sensational story which is being
quietly whispered about among those iden
tified with railroad affairs by the knowl
edge that Chris Buckley and Maurice
Schmitt, two large stockholders in the
Sutter-street company, are not at all un
willing to talk business with Market-street
people. It is also fresh in the memory of
the people that tnrough the delicate
manipulation of the Market-street com
pany Mayor Sutro was shut out on his bid
for the Hush-street line and it meant war
to the knife when tne first rail of the Sutro
line was laid.
The key to the situation is the contract
entered into by the Sutter-street company
and Mayor Sutro. If the controlling in
terest in the Sutter-street line passes into
the hands of the MarKet-street company
the latter will make an effort to break this
contract in tlie courts.
On that head Mayor Sutro said yester
aay : "The octopus can't do it. This story
bus been in the air for several days, and I
have no doubt the 'octopus' will invoke
the a,id of its 'law hatchery.' I don't
think tney can do anything in that direc
tion. The contract I have with the Sutter
street company runs as long as the road is
iv operation. If it passed through a dozen
hands it would not affect the existing
agreement. No; their 'law hatchery' is
powerless to do me any harm there. They
will, no doubt, try to have the contract
declared illegal. Yes; I nave known
about the scheme of the company to buy
the Morrow, Schmitt and Buckley stock,
but it may be that they will back out
when tney find that my contract is a part
of the road itself and cannot be affected by
any change of ownership. In any event,
they will have all the fight on their hands
they want and I will follow them through
all the courts in the land."
Mr. Mills could not be seen yesterday,
but his presence here at this time is re
garded as significant by those who are on
the inside in street-railway affairs.
Within the iast few days there has been
considerable quiet discussion in street
railway circles concerning the perpetuity
of Mayor Sutro's contract with the Sutter
etreet company.
It is contended by some that when the
road changes hands the present compact
will be void. Others agree with the Mayor

that it will be in force as long as the road

Mayor Sutro apprehends a fight on the
part of the Market-street company in the
event of the transfer, and he says he is
prepared to meet hot snot with grape
and canister.
WAS THE BEER DRUGGED?
Henry Nettleman Regains HU Sense* at
the City Kecelvlng Hospital
The young man whose case aroused such
interest among the physicians at the Re
ceiving Hospital regained his senses yes
terday morning.
Dr. Ilir.ne spoke to him yesterday morn
ing and he replied intelligently. He said
his name was Henry Nettleman and that
he was a native of Germany. He could
not account for his lapse of memory.
"I came to the City from the Santa Cruz
Mountains on Tuesday afternoon." said
Nettleman, later. "I left my baggage at
the ferry till I could look around and get a
place to stop in. I had $25 in my pocket,
and at night I went to some of the dives
and had a few drinks.
"The last one I remember being in was
on Bush street, near Dupont. 1 went to a
rear room and ordered a glass of beer. I
drank the beer and pulled all my money
out of my pocket as I paid for it. Some
one hit me a terrific blow on the jaw,
knocking me down, and grabbed Â«ny money
and my baggage check, which was also in
my hand.
"I remember feeling a queer sensation
in my head, when I rushed out of the sa
loon and when the policeman arrested me
I knew what he was asking me, but some
how I couldn't answer him. I have only
a hazy recollection of what happened rue
after till I found myself in the padded
cell this morning. I don't know if the
beer was drugged, but it might have been."
Dr. Weil, after having a talk with Net
tleman, allowed him to leave the hospital
yesterday alternoon. He immediately
went to police headquarters and reported
being roobatl of his money and baggage
check.

LATHAM IS REINSTATED.
Treasury Department Holds Hi* Dli
lnUftftl Against Civil Service Rules.
Collector Wise was yesterday instructed
by the Treasury Department to reinstate
ex-Night Inspector William C. Latham,
who was removed ie December, 1894,
ostensibly for neglect of duty and inuoin
petency.
At the time Latham gave it out that his
downfall was due to political causes and
announced his intention of fighting the
case in Washington. Through the efforts
of influential friends the action ot the
Collector has been reversed, the depart
ment assuming the ground that the re
moval was in violation of the civil service
rules.
Latham's dismissal occurred about the
time of the Foss opium ring scandal, his
name being indirectly connected with
that disgraceful affair.
Knocked Down and Robbed.
W. G. Seidlitz. who lives on Twelfth and
Market xtreeu, was taken to the Receiving
Hospital early yesterday morning with bis face
badly swollen and bruised. He said he had
been drinking around the "tenderloin dis
trict," and while on his way home two men
knocked him down at Stockton and O'FarreU
streets and robbed him of his watch and $2 50.
The police are investigating the case.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 8, 1896.
AN ELOPEMENT,
NOW A DIVORCE,
The Young Bride Said to
Be a Victim of Hyp
notic Power.
GOLDSON ASKS RELIEF.
His Wife Refused to Live With
Him and Went to Los
Angeles.
THREE DAYS OF COURTSHIP.
The Mothers-in-Law Take a Hand
and Make Things Inter
esting.
W. H. Goldson Jr. hypnotized a young
lady about two j ears ago and a little trip
to Alameda and an impromptu marriage
were the result. To-day he brought suit
for a divorce on the ground of desertion.
Goldson is a young attorney, living with
Mrs. Musette Chick Goldson, Who Eloped While Under a Hypnotic Spell. Her
HnsbanJ Is Now Sning for a Divorce-
bis mother, Dr. Goldson, at a sanitarium
on Oak street, Oakland. Miss Musette Chick
was sent to the health resort by her parents
with the instiuctions that she be well
looked alter and tTeated as a daughter.
Young Goldson, who had been married
and divorced before, although but a boy
in appearance, concluded that the best
wav to look after a young lady was to
make her his wife. He used his mesmeric
power and an elopement ensued.
The story that followed is one of those
little romances that come to light rather
more often in Alameda County than else
where.
Miss Musette Chick is the daughter of a
well-known mining man. She was a stu
dent at MiUs College and was being treated
by Mrs. Dr. Goldson. The doctor thought
the young lady could be better treated at
the sanitarium, and Miss Chick took her
advice. She had been there jnst three days
when the elopement was planned and car
ried out The marriage was kept secret,
but within two weeks Dr. Goldson was
surprised to read in the papers that her
fair patient was her daughter-in-law.
Tne next surprise was the publication of
the following little notice in the local
papers:
Notice Is hereby given that as my wife, Mrs.
W. H. Goldson Jr., has left my bed and board
without just cause or provocation, I will not
be responsible for any debta of her contracting.
W. A. Goldson Ja.
Oakland, December 3, 1895.
"After their hurried marriage," said
Mrs. Chick, mother of the young wife,
"they lived together just one year, when
Musette came back to us. She showed
that she had been very roughly treated
He threatenea her life on various occa
sions and once he was so insanely jealous
that he picked her up and carried her up
stairs because she was talking to a man
wbo runs the baths at the sanitarium. At
another time he threatened to throw him
self downstairs and in this way made her
life a torment and kept her prostrated
with nervous fear. Then he made a regu
lar drudge of her at the sanitarium and
worked the poor child almost to death.
She had never been used to such work, and
while there was compelled to do every
thing from kitchen-work up and down."
About six months ago Goldson's wife was
traveling with her mother, and was on her
way from Colfax to San Francisco. At
.Sixteenth-street depot she was taken so ill
that the young lady had to be sent into
Oakland. Goldson heard that his wife
was here, and made several efforts to see
her. He was denied admission to her
apartments, and Mrs. Chick went to the
District Attorney to see if he could be ar
rested, but Goldson did nothing to warrant
such a proceeding.
After this step, the fight resolved itself
into one of too much mother-in-law. Mrs.
Chick expressed some very definite opin
ions about Mrs. Dr. Goldson, and young
Goldson retaliated for himself and mother.
Finally Mrs. Chick and her daughter went
to Los Angeles so as to be away from what
they called the persecutions of Goldson.
Before leaving Mrs. Chick said: "It is
a well-known fact that Mrs. Goldson runs
the family and has entire control of the
actions of my daughter's husband. How
is it possible then to consider the actions
of this young scapegrace as being inde
pendent of his mother's influence? If she
directed him in other affairs, is it not rea
sonable to infer that she directed and con
trolled his matrimonial life? To prove
this I take the liberty of recounting a con
fidential conversation I had with Mrs. Dr.
Goldson some months after Musette's mar
riage.
"Once while she was sick young Goldson
brought her a large powder which he said
the doctor had prescribed for her. The
doctor had only left the room a few min
utes and on inquiring I fouud that no such
thing had been ordered.
"On another occasion he threatened her
with a revolver. In view of this condition
of affairs Mrs. Goldson advised me to take
my daughter away, stating that her son
was incapable of providing for a wife. In
answer to my inquiry as to what her son
would do in the event, she told me that
she would take care of him, as she had
always done, and that he was so constituted
that he ought never to be away from his
mother's apron strings. A most impor
tant fact was omittedâ she never sug
gested how tue expenses of her son's wife
were to be met after her removal, and I
can here truthfully say that be has not
contributed one penny toward her support
since she left the sanitarium. I must say
that no one expects him to do anything
for her, for it is impossible to get blood out
of a turnip."
"I have filed my complaint for divorce,"
said Attorney Goldson to-day, "because I
was informed that my wife intended to do
so in Los Angeles and I wanted to nave
the case settled here. I have merely
alleged desertion and shall have no diffi
culty in making out my case. This is not
my first experience with divorces, I was
married very young and was divorced
when I was 22. Miss Chick knew that."
GARBER CLOSES TO-DAY.
The Railroad Attorney Quotes Authorl
tlon to Support Hi- Position.
Ex-Judge Garber will probably close his
argument in the railroad intervention suit
to-day. Yesterday he confined himself to
a general review of the case, quoting many
authorities in support of his position.
Mr. Garber begau by saying that the
system of leases was not an illegal com
bination because the law authorized such
acts. When the constitution did not pro
hibit lease combination tbe speaker con
tended that the Commissioners had no
right to interfere.
In answer to ex-Judge Hayne's argument
that if the system was wrong here it
applied to every section of the country
through which the Southern Pacific had a
line, Mr. Garber argued that the
system ended at the Texas border, because
the laws of that State prohibited the form
ine of combinations. The able railroad
exponent cited several authorities in sup
port of his position.
DID NOT REPORT A BIRTH
Dr. Gerrigues Arrested at the
Instance of the Board of
Health.
Many Other Physicians May Be Taken
Into Custody on Similar
Charges.
The first doctor to be brought to time
under the law regulating the registration
of births surrendered himself yesterday,
after being notified that a warrant was out
for his arrest. The Health Department
has had a number of physicians under the
watchful eyes of inspectors for some time
past, and evidence has been gathered
suilicient to convict a score or more under
the present existing regulations.
Among those who failed to properly and
promptly register births was Dr. L. F.
Gerrigues, and in order to impress it on
the minds of all the City practitioners that
they must comply with the law, it was
decided to arrest him on a case that re
cently came under the observation of the
Health Office.
When notified that he was to be arrested
Dr. Gerrigues immediately appeared at
the. Health ( mice and stated that he had
no intention of evading the law and that
it was merely an oversight that the birth
hod not been registered.
He was told, however, that the depart
ment must begin somewhere, aud that
unless he desired to plead guilty he must
stand trial. It was decided, however, not
to insist upon a heavy penalty, but to
allow him to get off with a light fine and
to use his case as a warning to other phy
sicians who have persisted in their neglect
to register births.
A number of doctors have signified their
intention of fighting the law, but this will
not deter the health officials from causing
the arrest of all those who violate the regu
lations. These are as follows:
SECTION 3024, POLmCAI, CODE OF CALIFORNIA.
Sec. 30*24. Physicians and midwives must,
on or beiore the fourth day of each month,
make a return to the Health Officer of all

attendants, the parent must make such report
within thirty days after the birth of the child,
buch returns must be made in accordance with
rules adopted and upon blanks turnished by
the Board of Health
ORDER 2341, BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.

CHINESE CHEAP
LABOR OUTDONE,
White Girls Have Sup
planted Coolies in a
Factory.
AND GET LOWER WAGES
Mongolians Who Struck for Be>
ter Pay Were at Once
Replaced.
VERY PECULIAR COMBINATION.
The Establishment Is Now Running
Full Time Under Chinese
Control.
For once the Chinese are beaten at their
own game. Over thirty white girls are
working in a blouse-waist factory for
wages that the coolies refused to accept.
The latter got independent and demanded
more money for their labor. The demand
was refused and the men walked out. It
was a regular old-fashioned strike, but,
unlike the white men, the Chinese did not
stand around the factory, but at once dis
appeared in the depths of Chinatown.
Later they returned and removed their
machines, thus leaving the bosses without
the necessary implements.
It was at this stage of the game that the
Chinese owners pf the factory rose superior
to the occasion. They purchased a small
stationary engine and about thirty ma
chines, and soon had the whole outfit
running by steampower. While the
changes were being made they adver
tised for girls to work the sewing
machines, and on opening day they had
over 150 applicants. The desired number
were picked out and inside of an hour
thereafter blouse waists were being counted
up on the shelves by the dozen.
The trouble occurred in the Chinese
house of Hue Kai & Co. It Is one of the
wealthiest firms in Chinese circles. Its
place of business is on the southeast cor
ner of Clay and Davis streets. At one
time it was in the boot and shoe business,
but latterly there has been no pjpfit in
the manufacture of those goods, so it
turned its attention to blouse waists. A
white designer was engaged, and, as he is
also a special policeman, he was all the
more desirable. An enormous quantity of
material was bought at a low rate, and
soon Hue Kai & Co. were in active compe
tition with the big New York firms.
It waswhen work was being rushed and
there were many orders on hand that the
Chinese struck. Wong Yung, the superin
tendent of the concern, did not hesitate
long. He told his fellow-countrymen to
pack up and go. They did not believe him
at first, but when he told them in plain
terms that he was going to get white girls,
who would do better work for less money,
they were at last convinced. Thus it was
that the change came about.
The factory on the corner of Clay and
Davis streets presents an odd appearance
every day. In the little office sits the
Chinese bookkeeper. At a table near by is
the white designer, while next to him are
two Chinese cutters. The designer makes
the pattern and the Chinese cut out the
goods, while the white girls do the sewing
on the machines. Walking up and down
between the machines are Chinese who
keep tally of the work done by each girl
and who also carry the completed blouses
to the packers. By working hard for
eleven hours a day the girls can make all
the way from 50 to 75 cents, and some of
them have been known to make $1 for
three consecutive days, but the next day
they had to "lay off " and rest.
In the rear of the bJoase factory Hue
Kai & Co. also run their shoe factory on a
small scale. None but Chinese are em
ployed in it, so the entire floor shows a
strance mingling of Mongolian men and
Caucasian women.
The Chinese blousemakers have not
taken their defeat kindly, and whenever
the girls are leaving the factory at the
noon hour or fitting time they congre
gate on the sidewalk and make faces at
their Biipplanters. They also make re
marks to each other, but as it is in their
own tongue nobody cares. "When the
special policeman comes down the stairs
they generally disperse. The factory is
now in full swing, and half the stylish
waists on sale in the various stores are
turned out by the Caucasian-Mongolian
combination employed by Hue Kai & Co.
STOCKHOLDERS MUST FAT.
The Debt of the North American Navi
gation Company.
General Manager Curtis of tne Traffic
Association has issued a call for a meet
ing of the stockholders of the defunct
North American Navigation Company, to
be held in the Board of Trade rooms next
Wednesday, to take some action regarding
the $35,672 64 which the stockholders
jointly owe to the Panama Railroad Com
pany. This" debt represents the balance
due the railroad company under the agree
ment by which the navigation company
operated a line of steamers between San
Francisco and the isthmus for fourteen
months beginning in 1892.
It will be remembered that the mer
chants raised $300,000 as a subsidy to the
line while the rate war was on, and an im
mense saving in freight charges was made.
The debt has been hanging unpaid ever
since the operations of the company ceased,
and now the Panama Kailroad Company is
pressing for payment, having, however,
offered to accept 78 per cent of the amount
due if paid before June 1. Alfred E. Drake
is en route here as a special agent of the
company, and will be present at the meet
ing on Wednesday.
Father Torke's Next Lecture.
On next Friday evening, May 8, Rev. Father
Yorke will deliver a lecture in Metropolitan
Temple. This will be the fourth of the series
being delivered under the auspices of the
American Women's Liberal League. The sub
ject of the lecture will be "The DaySprlng From

organ and Mrs. Thomas H. Griffiu will ren
der a choice vocal solo. Tickets tor admission
may be purchased at the headquarters of the
