LONDON, Esq., April 11.â Paris has a
:nown trick of not doing what every
(">> iv agrees in expecting her to d<
this needs to be kept in mind now, be
cause everybody iÂ« hearing some whis
pered phase of general suspicion that
grave things are on the point of happening
in France. These dispatches were sent out
fifteen months ago, when the Chamber
overruled a decree of the council of state.
Really this was a thousand times more
important than the incidental overthrow
cf the Dupuy Cabinet and the resignation
of President Ca.-imir-Perier. These Jatter
thing* excited public interest much more,
no doubt, but it was the other thing which
altered history. From that moment a
new French revolution began, and though
-':e<supto last October was barely
perceptible it has moved forward Â«ince then
wi:h ever-increasinjr velocity, until now it
s-enis un tne very brink of violent descent
into the rapids of popular commotion. No
one darts to formulate a prediction as to
is to occur, hut it is the prevalent
feeling that the closing ten days* of April
will be momentous of Bourgeois' Jacobin
like determination to throttle the Senate.
For the mument it is interesting to
wonder what part President Faure will
play in the drama now set soon to be un
:. He was elected, it will be remem
bered, by a combination of ail the Reac
tionary. Anti-Radical element in the Ver
sailles Congress. Practically every Sena
tor who is now nerving himself fora battle
tti the dee* 'a with Bourgeois voted on the
final ballot for Faure. Afterward it was
disclosed that they did this because word
had passed among them that Faure'a
wife's father had been a convicted embez
zler, and knowledge of this secret would
give them a terrible power over him. To
their amazement, once in oilice, he began
taking his own line, which was not theirs.
They vainly threatened him, and finally
exploded their scandalous sensation. He
faced it like an honest man, with a pro
tecting arm around his wife, and France
like.l him all the better for it. Since then
he has been frankly on the side of the
Radicals in the south. He went out of his
way to shuw hi- sympathy with Bourgeois'
aggressive policy.
This has made the monarchical, banking,
speculating, snob classes generally furious
with ra^e. When he went to the Am'euil
rares last Sunday with his wife and
daughter, they organized a swell mob
demonstration -of hostility to the Presi
dential party, news of which, traveling
back to Paris, created a preat stir in the
Faubourgs. The police reports of this
nt made the President decide not to
\uteuil again, but yesterday it was
! advisable that he should go, and
as taken that there should be popu
lar cheers fur him. The occupants of the
prand stand and boxes decided not to

too, i> being talked about in Paris.
ay s reports say that Bourgeois and
binet are leaning now to the idea of
immediate dissolution. This cannot be
done constitutionally without the assent
of the Senate, which it is well known will
be refuse.!, hut the resolution to dispense
with the Senate's consent would be only a
trifle better than the other things that
Bourgeois has done already in his crusade
against the upper house.
If he and Kaure risfeed this and went to
the country on tfce issue of the income tax
there is no earthly doubt that there would
bÂ« a tremendous popuiar rally at the polls
in their favor. This is well understood by
the Senate and by the classes which it rep
resents, and the notion that they will go to
extremes to resist it is perhaps* the most
definite idea in the whole general supposi
tion that trouble is impending.
The lethargy of the Easter holidays still
forma a convenient pretext for giving out
no diplomatic dews, but it is plain enough
that the foreign oih'ces have all been work
ing full time during the time of recess. I
have reason to believe that England and
I Luve come to close quarter on the
f of the far East and tnat within a
lew days or weeks we shall hear either
that an arrangement has been reached by
which England takes a big territorial cotu
pensation for the events in Korea and
Manchuria or thatar:ipture is threatened.
To-day's meeting at Venice of Emperor
William and King Humbert is purposely
invested with political importance by the
presenooof alot of the principal German
and Italian diplomats, rind by the osten
tatious bringing from Ilon.e of a chest full
of foreign oiiice documents. This is meant
of course for public evidence that the
triple alliance is as solid as ever. England
is waiting with more interest, however
for some indication that Germany has
withdrawn from its embarrassing com-
Unaiion with Russia and France in Chi
nese matt â¢Â«. When that comes, as there
ik apparently email doubt that it will
come, then Ensrii.vlnnen will draw a iong
breath of relief; and will be willing to let
Salisbury and Chamberiaia put on full
steam ahead. In expectation of this they
have already ceased grumbling about the
Soudan adventure. They neither under
stand nor like it, it is true, and they are
biiii personally repelled by the notion of

German partnership, but there has been
such a wearing strain on the national
nerves during the pant six weeks ol uncer
tainty and menace that they will be only
too glad to find themselves landed in any
combination at any price which promises
safety.
There have been so many Irish land
bills in the last fifteen years that it is not
easy to get up much eagerness at West
minster as to the provisions of the new
one, which will be brought in Monday.
The chief interest in it, from a political
point of view, is to see how the Govern
ment has managed to strike a compromise
between the ultra landlord views of its
aristDoratic Irish supporters and the de
mands of the Protestant farmers of Ulster,
whose oilicial representative is T. W. Rus
sell. A year ago there seemed a fair pros
pect that this latter class would be driven
to join hands with the Nationalists, and at
the summer elections they did help the
Nationalists to recapture three seats. Since
then, however, Russell has received a sala
ried ollice and a promise that some of his
views at least would be adopted in the new
land bill; and, on the other hand, the Na
tionalist movement has lapsed into such
profound moral and intellectual disrepute
that all danger of its making converts in.
Ulster or elsewhere has entirely vanished.
It is understood that the bill will go over
further in the tenants' direction than Mor
ley's, and that the Nationalists probably
will have little to complain of except de
tuils of valuation.
The daily Chronicle has scored a unique
journalistic feat by getting a letter from
the Pope, through Cardinal Rampolla, ad
dressed to its editor and warmly bestowing
the papal benediction on the paper's
earnest efforts to promote international
arbitration. This following the manifest
of the three English-speaking cardinals
gives to Rome a pre-eminence in this
pacific movement which puts the English
established church rather in a corner. I
hear that the Archbishop of Canterbury ia

being besieged by letters from bishops and
leading churchmen, clerical and lay, urg
ing that some chance be given to them
formally to indorse the principle and iden
tify the church with the movement.
The papers having printed seven or
eiÂ«ht different versions of the ceremonial
which is to mark the wedding of Princess
Maud of Wales in July, now briefly state
that nothing whatever has been settled
yet. This experience is by no means un
familiar, for of late the Queen, who has
always strenuously guarded her supreme
authority in such matters, has taken great
delight in making programmes and then
altering them day by day in one detail
after another till the court officials are at,
their wits' end to follow what has been or
dained, but this coming function is by far
the most marked example yet seen of the
royal idiosyncrasies, and hi private con
versation one may near many curious
tales about the domestic scenes that it has
already involved. Publicly, however, the
most decorous silence is preserved.
Speaking still of the London press, it is
hard not to sympathize a little with the
fiasco of the Olympian games from the
point of view of tlie editors here. They
sent out special correspondents to make a
big feature of the affair and were to have
voluminous telegraphic reports. I can
only speak from knowledge in one case,
but assume it is true in others, that tele
grams came all right and at length, but
consisted of such a monotonous, melan
choly record of American triumphs that
they were cut down to the barest skeleton.
It is suggested now in a vague way that
England was hardly represented at all
among the athletes, but I do not think
that this is true. The Greeks themselves
centered their attention on the twenty-six
mile run from Marathon, which had the
attraction of reproducing a historic feat
that every Hellenic child knows, as we
know Paul Reverr's ride, jiud they were
in a frenzy of delight when three Greeks
came in ahead, and. the Hungarian comp
etitor who followed at a respectable dis
tance brought the news that all the others
had broken down half way.
Among accumulating signs that the
minor German States are banding together
in hostility to Prussia, the controversy
which is proceeding about the Hessian
railroad deserves attention. This is one
of a few lines remaining in the Empire
which are privately owned, and Prussia
has coerced the Hessian Government into
combining with it to force the sharehold
ers to sell out to the State. This line,
which is partly in Prussia and partly in
Hesse, ought by the superiority of its route,
enjoy the bulk of traffic from Cologne to
Frankfort, but it has been systematically
boycotted by the Prussian Ministry for
years. Despite this, it 3 stock was quoted
at 122 when the announcement was made
this week that the two governments had
offered to buy it up at 115. This off it,
coupled with the blunt hint that if re
fused Prussia would wreck the road al
together, will probably be accepted, but it
has created the deepest resentment all
through South Germany, and will be heard
of again.
Quite as little calculated to increase af
fection for Prussia among its neighbors is
the grotesquely brutal incident of Kotze's
duel with Schrader, to which he was liter
ally compelled by the Prussian aristocracy.
Kotze suffered arrest and imprisonment
for charges of infamy, which he declares
to be false and which could not be proved,
and which he traced primarily to Schrader,
who is one of the court chamberlains. To
vindicate himself he sued Schrader for
libel, instead of accepting his challenge,
whereupon the officers of the corps of
which he is a member expelled him as un
worthy as an associate of Prussian officers.
The Emperor intervened and modified the
expulsion to a warning that he must not
offend again in that way, the result of
which was, of course, that he had to meet
Schrader in the field. For this ordeal he
practiced day and ni^ht, until his aim had
deadly accuracy, and confessedly he went
out to kill. The savagery of the thing is
made complete Dy the fact that he will now
have to undergo a nominal confinement
in a fortress for offense against the civil
law, although he was practically ordered
by the Emperor in the name of martial
etiquette to break it. Thia gross illustration
of what Prussian militaryism means will
sink deep into the minds of thousands of
civilians all over the empire and germinate
as a social democratic seed.
If our Congress at Washington enjoyed
universal esteem hers for wisdom, sobriety
and sincere good faith, it would stiil prob
ably do poor Mrs. Maybrick more harm
than good by interfering in her case, but
the present body has come to mean to the
European imagination almost everything
that is silly, vulgar and dishonest. In
deed, Europeans have managed to pre
serve respect for the American people as a
whole only by believing that they are
wickedly misrepresented by this extraor
dinary Congress: Englishmen in particu
lar hold this view, and use it as an argu
ment in counseling the Spaniards to have
patience, and they consequently feel like
saying that the meddling of such a body
in sucb a case is simply intolerable. I
said at the time of the trial that the
unfortunate woman was wrongfully con
victed on the evidence, and, putting the
abstract question of moral guilt aside, I
believe that has come to be the feeling of
a great majority of people here. The
present Home Secretary, I understand,
distinctly leaned to this view, but was
overborne by Salisbury, Herscheil. Glamor
gan and Asquith, all of whom had official
knowledge or prejudice about the case,
but there were still chances of making
public opinion operative in the matter,
and it is these which Congress' imperti
nent bungling will diminish, if not destroy.
Elizabeth L. Banks has achieved more
fame by a single letter in the Times than
by all her arduous, valuable labor on the
. servant question. There is a bill before
Parliament to abate street noises, and all
sorts of soreheaas have been ventilating
tiieir grievances in the Times about
piano?, organs, street bands, muffin bells,
newsboys' cries and every other conceiv
able item in London's roar. Miss Banks
wrote briskiy and brightly in favor of
noise, and adroitly brought in the muz
zling of dogs as another achievement of
these same kill- joys. The Times editorially
sniffed at her, but to-day correspondents
are beginning to express their joy at her
remarks, and I hear people talking every
where of her letter.
The rumor has been heard often enough

AN INDIFFERENT ARCHITECT.
California Congressmen Propose to
Compel Treasury Department Men
to Act at Once.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 11.-NinÂ«
years ago, or to speak accurately, on March
3, 1887, Congress authorized the construc
tion of a new Postoffice buildfng in San
Francisco, yet not one step has been taken
toward its construction. The cost of the
site and building has been increased from
time to time, but for nine years California
Congressmen and San Francisco press rep
resentatives have tramped up and down
the Treasury Department stairs, have worn
a path in the stone steps and consumed
an infinite amount of shoe leather in an
endeavor to find out how the work was pro
gressing. For years this subject has been
foremost in the California colony here,
and on dull days correspondents have
always tramped up the marble steps to
inquire "How is the San Francisco Post
office building coming on?" True, they
never received much satisfaction, but could
usually write a half column of "reasons'*
why the work was delayed.
The report of the expert engineering
commission concerning the foundation
has been before the supervising architect
for about one year, and with a balance left
after the purchase of the site and the
$50.0C0 additional appropriated to com
mence building, the amount now on hand
and available is $216,736, according to a
statement made to The Call corre
spondent by the acting supervising archi
tect of the Treasury to-day.
For many months the architect has
given one excuse after another for not
commencing the work of construction. It
was surmised, however, that the real rea
son was on account of the low state of
finances of the Nation. Secretary Carlisle
was indisposed to commence the erection
of any public buildings which involved the
expenditure of so large an amount of
money. Finally, however, sketch plans
were prepared and together with a de
scription of the interior arrangements of
the building, were printed in The Call.
It was then given out by the Treasury DeÂ«
partment that a further reason for delay
was that the Federal officers of California
had failed to respond to the department's
request that they send on suggestions &a
to arrangement of rooms.
Three or four months ago the depart
ment sent to Judges Morrow and McKenna
and other Federal officials the plan of in
terior arrangements with a request that
they examine them and suggest to the
supervising architect what chance, if any,
they might wish to make. All of these
officers responded several weeks ago. But
it was found that their ideas did not agree.
The arrangement of rooms as suggested
by the Judges was found to|be inconsistent
and incompatible with the plans as oat
lined-by the Postmaster.

tect wrote to Postmaster McCoppin asking
him to send on his own idea as to how the
rooms to be devoted to the postoffice
should be arranged.
The acting supervising architect said to
TnE Call correspondent to-day:
"We are now waiting to hear from Post
mast-r McCoppin. You understand that
these buildings are tr.ken up in their regu
lar order, and San Francisco has now been
reached, but we cannot go on with our
pian? until the Federal officers have
agreed as to arrangement of their several
and respective rooms."
Another official of the supervising
architects office, who, however, does not
Wish to be quoted, said to The Call cor
respondent that unless tlie Federal of
ficers speedily agreed on the interior ar
rangement of the building the aichitect
would take the matter in his own hands
and go ahead with the plans. He said
that one of the United States Judges had
been very much dissatisfied with the de
signs of the buildinz, and had intimated
to the department that unless the plans,
were changed he would object to moving
into it. He did not say who this official
was. but it is surmised that it was either
Judge MeKenna or Judge Morrow. It
was further ascertained that the supervis
ing architect would modify the plans and
general design of the building. The de
sign, as prepared by tlio former architect
of the treasury, O'Rourke, was the style of
Italian renaissance. The modified plans
will be after the style of Spanish renais
sance, and the appeurance of tho building
will be greatly changed and improved.
Indeed, the change will be so radical that
the appearance of the building will be
altogether different.
An officer of the supervising architect's
office said to a Call correspondent to-day :
*'Of course we cannot decide on ihe design
until we know how much space each one
of the Federal offices will need, and until
Postmaster McCoppin sends on his own
ideas we cannot go ahead with the plans.
But in general, it will be enough to say
that the general apDearance of the build
ing will be greatly improved and beauti
fied."
The Call correspondent asked the reason
for changing the design of the building,
and was told that the former plans had
been prepared by Supervising Architect
O'Kourke, hut that the present architect,
Aikin, was not altogether satisfied with
them, and had directed draughtsmen of the
office to prepare other designs. The cor
respondent inquired when the people of
San Francisco might reasonably expect
the work of construction to begin, and was
told that it all depended on the Federal
officers, but a? soon as Postmaster McCop
pin responded to the request of the
architect's office, and it was found that
the ideas of the several Federal officers
might be amalgamated, the draughtsmen
of the ofhee would immediately begin to
draw new sketch plans.
"Then, when in your opinion will real
construction of the building commence?"
asked the correspondent.
The acting supervising architect replied:
"That would be impossible to say. It
might be only a month or so, and it might
be a year, but you may say to your people
that the San Francisco building has been
reached in regular order and work will be
rushed as rapidly as possible. These
buildings are taken up in the order in
which appropriations were made by Con
gress, and heretofore it has been impossi
ble for us to do anything with the San
Francisco building for the reason that
there were other buildings ahead of it, and
for the further reason that there has been
a delay in hearing from Federal officers in
California."
This was all the satisfaction that could
be obtained from the architect.
Senator Perkins said to The Call corre
spondent to-night:
"The way the supervising architect has
acted in this matter has been very aggra
vating. Several months ago Judge Mc-
Kenna wrote me. giving his ideas as to ar
rangements of courtrooms, judges' cham
ber*, clerks' and marshals' rooms, etc.
"He was anxious to have the courtrooms
located at the several corners of the build
ing, so as to secure as much light as possi
ble, and also suggested that for the sake of
convenience the clerks' and marshals'
offices and other rooms connected with the
court all be situated on the game floor. I
went to gee the supervising architect and
had a short interview with him. He ex
pressed regret that the work on the build
in*; had been delayed, but said that the
office was swamped with work and he was
doing nis best with the force he had and
that there would be many buildings to
claim his attention. Time went on, and
finally I wrote him, suggesting that if he
would send me an estimate of the amount
required for additional draftsmen I would
introduce a bill in the Senate to appropri
ate money for that purpose, as was donÂ« in
the cabt- of Chicago's postoffice, when
Congress made a special appropriation to
secure draftsmen for that building. I was
somewhat surprised at receiving no an
swer to my letter, for I had naturally sup
posed that the supervising architect would
be willing and anxious to have assistance
furnished him.
"I wrote him again, but received no
satisfaction. Then I sent a special mes
senger conveying an intimation that I
could not understand his reason for not
replying to my communications. I in
structed my messenger to secure some
kind of answer. The architect promised
to furnish me the data I had requested,
but I never received them.
"It was very discourteous treatment, to
say the least, and I gave him to under
stand that unless I received some informa
tion from him I would introduce a reso
lution in the Senate demanding to know
from the Secretary of the Treasury the
reason for delay in commencing work on
the building, and directing him to proceed
with the construction. The supervising
architect then sent his secretary to see me.
I was not in my hotel, but he left his card.
I afterward received notice from the de
partment that if the Public fJuildings and
Grounds Committee would request infor
mation on the subject it would be fur
nished to Congress. The resolution was
then passed, and in response the Secretary
of the Treasury sent a letter which merely
recited the fact that an appropriation for
the building had been made, the site pur
chased and the limit of cost of the build
in? fixed at $2,500,000, but that a proviso
had been made that no work was to be
done until the commission of Government
engineers haa examined the foundation
and reported it to be firm; that sketch
plans had been drawn, and the working
plans were being prepared and would be
completed as soor as possible.
"This was the la-t I heard of the mat
ter, and altogether it has been very un
satisfactory. There is some reason for
this delay which I cannot understand.
The supervising architect may be swamped
with business, but I offered to make an
earnest endeavor to provide assistance for
him. The truth is the supervising archi
tect is not a bis enough man for his place.
He devotes too much attention to details
of his office instead of entrusting it to
assistants. lam very much vexed on ac
count of tbe delay and leel that I have
been treated very discourteously by the
architect. lam considering the advisabil
ity of JiuroduciDg my resolution on Moa
day, demanding explicit information from
the Treasury Department why work is de
layed and directing the Secretary to pro
ceed with the construction immediately."
Representative Mazuire said: "I have
no knowledge of the status of the postoffice
building plans, but will say that I think
the delay iB unwarranted. Fonr weeks
ago I was told at the department that
plans would be proceeded with when cer
tain information had been received from
Federal officers at San Francisco as to the
interior arrangements, but since then I
have heard nothing."
Representative Loud said: "The depart
ment may make excuse after excuse. My
own opinion is that they are delaying
work on this building and others because
they have not the money to spare out of
Uncle Sams cashbox, but don't want to
admit the fact."
YAMAGATA IN THE EAST.
Many Leading Chicagoans Pay Their Re-
spects â New Yorkers Will Give Him a
Housing Military Reception.
CHICAGO, 11t... April 11.â Field Mar
shal Yamagata of Japan and party ar
rived from San Francisco on time yester
day morning and, accompanied by O. W.
Ruggles, general passenger agent of the
Michigan Central, were driven to the Audi
torium. Their arrival created a nutter in
the city, and a large number of officials
and leading citizens culled at the hotel to
pap their respects to the hero of the great
Oriental war.
At Omaha the Yamagata party was re
ceived with military honors yesterday,
and General Merritt, U. S. A., command
ing the Department of the Platte, called
in person and tendered military honors.
The tender was very graciously accepted
by the Marquis, but owing to the heavy
rain the function was called off.
The party will leave for Detroit on the
Vanderbilt line to-morrow, and on Sunday
will proceed to Niaeara Falls. General
Manager Toucey and General Passenger
Agent Daniels of the New York Central
Railroad will take Governor Morton and
staff and a committee of the legation to
meet the Japanese party at Niagara Falls,
and a special train will then convey all to
Albany, where Governor Morton will re
ceive Yamapata and pay to that distin
guished cnieftain the highest honors of the
State. Later the Marquis will go to New
York, where a large military escort will
receive him at the Grand Central station
of the New York Central and escort him to
the hotel.
The fame of the Marquis has preceded
him. The people of the East have learned
to appreciate his modesty, and it is safe to
say that he will receive from New York
State tne proudest honors he has known
since leaving his native country.

$30,000 and $40,000 on the contents, which
consisted entirely of household goods
which had been stored in the buiiding.
Shortly after the fire started Assistant
Chief Kendall, with eight or nine men,
started to carry a line of hose up the
stairway. They were met on the third
lloor by a denss volume of smoke, which
nearly suffocated them. Kendall and one
other of his men managed to tret back
down the stairway and told of the predic
ament of their comrades, and all were car
ried out in an unconscious condition and
taken to hospitals. While they are suffer
ing severely from the effects of inhaling
smoke the physicians believe they will re
cover.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 12, 1896.
CONSUL WALLER
RETURNS HOME
Tells in Detail a Story of
Inhuman Treatment at
Tamatave.
ABUSED BY THE FRENCH
Dragged to Prison on Trumped-
Up Charges and Hurriedly
Convicted.
NO AID FROM HIS SUCCESSOR.
Spat Upon and Reviled as He Lay in
Chains in the Hold of a
Steamer.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 11.â In the
second cabin of the New York, which ar
i rived from Southampton this morning,
i was John L. Waller, late "United States
j Consul at Tamatave, Madagascar, who
was convicted of treason by the French
and sentenced to twenty years' solitary
confinement. He wa9 transported to
I France, where he was imprisoned until
i February 20, when he was released through
: the intervention of the State Department
!at Washington. As to the merits of the
! case Waller, when questioned, said that
! he preferred not. to speak until he had
! conferred with his friends here.
Mr. Waller, when seen in the afternoon
at 127 West Seventeenth street, told in de
tail the story of his experiences. He said :
"When I went to Tamatave m 1891 I
was impressed by stories in the French
papers to the effect that I should get my
exequatur through the French residency,
because the French Government claimed a
protectorate over Madagascar. My prede
cessor. John P. Campbell, had obtained
his through the Malagassy Government, so
I followed his example. Then the French
press raved and advised that I should not
be recognized as Consul. Then the French
officials began to slight me, and in Febru
ary, 1891, one of my wife's servants was
assaulted on the streets of Tamatave.
That was the beginning. After three years
of bad treatment from the French offle-ials
I was succeeded by Edward T. Wetter, a
Southerner. I was in the hospital at this
time.
"On March 15, 1894, 1 received from the
Malagassy Government a valuable con
cession, consisting of 225 square miles or
144.00 C acres of land on the southwest
coast of Madagascar. I was not the
United States Consul then. I then sent
my stepson, Paul Bray, to the island of
Mauritius to get settlers for the land, and
while he was away sent him a cablegram
saying, 'Do not bind settlers to trade at
our stores.' Then France again began to
abuse me through the press, and declared
that I was trying to build up a new Hayti.
"Now," added Mr. Waller, "I did no
favors for the Malagassy Government for
the concession. That concession was given
mo under provisions of the treaty between
the Madagascar Government and the
United States, and the latter at that time
recognized only the Queen as the sovereign
of the island.
"That treaty provides that citizens of the
United States may enter into negotiations
with the Malacassy Government to secure
land grants and that they shall be pro
tected in the same by and under the
Malacassy treaty. The value of the grant
was between $3,000,000 and $4,000,000.
Under the provisions I will have to pay
$500 at the end of five years and after that
pay to the Malagassy Government 10 per
cent on the total income derived. The life
of t'.ie concession is sixty years.
"Now, as to my imprisonment. I was
arrested on March 5, 1894. Five French
soldiers came to my house and demanded
my papers. Luckily, my concession papers
had been sent away. They took every
thing else. They got papers of registry
of my lands, some of which I had sublet.
I was taken before Captain Lovesot, whose
interpreter called me a liar because I
would not admit to treason and various
other crimes. Then I was thrown into
prison, with three soldiers on guard over
me.
"My preliminary trial lasted four hours
and I was not allowed any witnesses.
After reading the testimony, which was
inaccurate, I was forced to sign it. The
prosecuting attorney then told me to get a
lawyer and that he could see my friends,
with tbe exception of Paul Bray, my step
son. I sent to acting United States Consul
Wetter, who did not come to see me, but
sent a lawyer named Gemvrdeu. The
latter took the case and worked on it until
twenty-four hours before the trial came
up, and then informed me that be must
have $300 at once. "It means twenty
years or $500,' said the amiable lawyer.
"Acting Consul Wetter then informed
me that he had expended $36 to prosecute
an American citizen named John T. Lyans
on a charge that I think was inhumanely
unjust to him. Then through a friend he
erot Mr. Le Grace to take the case. He
studied it for twenty hours and at the
trial, which lasted an hour and a half, he
cross-examined no one. The live judges
were out twenty minutes and rendered a
verdict of guilty. I wag to get twenty
years in solitary confinement. Next day
Mr. Le Grace said he would get mo a new
trial, and pending it I was again thrust
into prison,
"E. C. Woodward came to me and told
me that Consul Wetter had a knife ready
for me, and advised me to write and ask
his pardon for certain allusions I had
made to him in a letter to my wife. I did
so. 1 got this reply: 'You are charged
with being guilty of a violation of the law,
and although tbe /United States would
probably interfere to prevent oppression
you cannot expect clemency or relief.'
That letter of course was opened, and a
guard came to me with it and said : 'See,
your own Consul says you are guilty. How
can you blame the French?'
"An hour afterward my counsel came,
and in that time Wetter also arrived. Mr.
Le Grace said: 'It is most unfortunate
that such a letter should be written pend
ing trial.' Wetter replied: 'It is a viola
tion of international law for an officer of a
friendly power to break the United States
consular seal, yet it is a matter of indiffer.
ence to me whether a Government seal
that I place on a letter to you is broken or
not.'
"Regarding my letters to Minister Eus"
tis, he said that if necessary be would send
them, but that he did not want to burden
his mail with rqy mail.
"Tueu X was put on board the steamship
Jemnah, in the hold and under the hatch
way. Hoodlums from above spat upon
me as I lay, chained to an iron bar, on my
back. The rain came down on me and I
got the fever. The run from Tamatave to
Zanzibar took seven days. Two days of
this time I went without a bite to eat or a
drop of water. Tne Frenchmen laughed
at my misery. One fellow put a saber to
my lips and said, 'Eat that. 1
"A French corporal became my friend,
but it nearly cost me my life. He antaeo
nized ihe guard, who tiied to kill me.
While in Zanzibar an Englishman cameto
me and said : 'Cheer up and take an Eng
lishman's greeting. God and the great
American Republic will see you through.'
"I got to Marseilles on April 2, where I
was again put in prison. I got no medical
attendance, although I was so weak 1
could not walk.
"It was the same at Clairvaux, and at
each place I felt so sick that I thought I
should die. Then I was sent toNimesand
on May 5 I got my pardon.
"On November 5 I got a letter from Min
ister Eustis saying that I could get the
pardon, but that it involved the admission
on my rjart of the validity of my trial,
'which would bar me from any claim on
the French Government. 1 My answer was
that I did not want the pardon on those
conditions, and I added that I maintained
my claim for indemnity against the French
Government. I did not hear again from
Minister Eustis until he wired me that the
pardon had arrived and that if I needed
money to wire him."
Mr. Waller will go to Baltimore on Tues
day and to Washington on Wednesday.
He declined to say what he would do re
garding his concessions or to say who he
blamed for his troubles.
BILLS ON IMMIGRATION
Action by the Republican Caucus
Prevented by the Absence
of a Quorum.
Indications That the Pending Measures
Will Not Be Finally Considered
This S.'ssion.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 11.â The
absence of a quorum prevented definite
action at the Republican caucus which
was held at the Capitol to-night to con
sider what the party's action should be on
the McCall and Stone immigration bills.
The Stone bill provides for a consular
inspection of all persons desiring to emi
grate to the United States. The McCall
bill proposes an educational test.
Grosvenor of Ohio presided and the roll
call disclosed the presence of ninety-seven
members, twenty-six less than a quorum.
Bartholdt of Missouri, chairman of the
House Immigration Committee, strongly
opposed the Stone bill. He asserted that
it would discriminate against young Ger
mans between the ages of IS and 35, in
asmuch as the German Government would
stop them during the military period of
their age from securing the consular cer
tificate which is a prerequisite to the ad
mission to this country as citizens.
W. A. Stone of Pennsylvania, the author
of tne bill, favored Bnrtholdt with an
elaborate explanation of its provisions and
explained that he purposed amending it
in the particulars complained of when it
came before the House.
McCall of Massachusetts consumed some
time in making clear the provisions of his
own measure, which, it was apparent from
the discussion that followed, were satis
factory to all the members present. The
Stone bill, on the other hand, provoked
considerable criticism, although its merits
were generally recognized.
Dingley of Maine, the Republican leader
of the House, closed the discussion with
a brief statement that the shortness of the
session precluded the possibility of action
by the House on the measures, more par
ticularly as the Senate was not likely to
pass on them before adjournment.
TO TAX FILLED CHEESE.
Lite Souse Passed the Bill Chiefly on
Political Ground*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 11.â After
two days' debate the House this afternoon,
by a vote of 160 to 58, passed the "filled
cheese" bill, taxing the manufacture of the
product 1 cent a pound, and requiring the
manufacturers and dealers to pay a license.
The Committee on Ways and Means sug
gested a reduction of the retail dealers'
license from $40 to $12 a year, and that was
agreed to.
The vote on the bill was chiefly along
political lines, Republicans and Populists
favoring its passage and Democrats oppos
ing it. The following Republicans voted
a-ainst the bill: Aldnch, Belknap, Can
non, Connolly, Lorimer of Illinois, Brumm
of Pennsylvania, Evans of Kentucky. Long
of Kansas, McCall of Tennessee, Traoewell
of Indiana and Walker of Virginia.
The Senate joint resolution directing
the Secretary of War to transmit to Con
gress the survey and estimate of cost of
construction of a waterway connecting
Puget Sound and Salmon Bay with lakes
Union and Washington, Washington State,
was presented by Hermann (R.) of Oregon
and agreed to.
On motion of Pendleton (D.) of Texas
the session of Saturday, April 25, begin
ning at 2:30 o'clock, was set aside for
eulogies upon the late Representative W.
H. Cram of the Sixteenth Texas District.
At 4:45 p. m., on motion of Dingley, the
House adjourned until Monday.

GEORGE TAYLOR'S
DARING ESCAPE
One of the Meeks Murderers
Succeeds in Getting
Away.
THREE ARE IN THE PLOT
Two of the Condemned Men
Caught While Sliding Down
a Rope.
MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE ROOF
There Is Considerab'e Exciteiceat and
Posses Are in Pursuit of the
Fugitive.
CARROLLTON, Mo., April 11.â Bill and
George Taylor, murderers of the Meets
family, sentenced to be hanged April 30,
and Lee Cunningham, the latter also in
jail for murder, made an attempt to break
jail to-night. George succeeded in getting
away, but Bill Taylor and Cunningham
were captured. Night Watchman Rhelton
was in the jail at 8:20 o'clock and every
thing was all right He went out in the
back yard, and was talking to a friend
when he heard a noise at the opposite cor
ner of the jail. He rushed round to that
side, reaching there just in time to catch
Cunningham as he slid down a rope to the
ground.
Bill Taylor was half way down, and
when he saw Cunningham was caught he
cried to the night watchman that he
would give up and for him not to shoot.
He then slid on down to the ground into
Bhelton's arms. He told Shelton that
George was still on the roof. Bhelton be
lieved him and stood guard to catch him
as he came down. The alarm was given
and Sheriff Stanley came out, handcuffed
the two prisoners together and locked
them in their cells.
A search in a few minutes revealed that
George was gone. An examination of the
jail revealed the fact that a bolt had been
cut in the back of one of the cells and a
bar knocked off. This gave the prisoners
access to the corridor. Next they went up
on top of the cage up into the garret and
out ti! rough the scuttle on to the roof.
They took a fifty-foot rope with them,
fastened it on top of the roof and George
Taylor must have been the first to go
down, as no chance was given him to get
down after the night watchman discovered
the attempt to escape.
As soon as it was found that Georaje was
gone a pair of hounds were secured, and
they were put on the trail. They followed
it to the back gate, bat made no progress
beyond. Young Leonard of Norburn, a
brother-in-law of one of the Taylors, has
been here to-day. Since supper he took a
team at a livery stable and drove out of
town. He may have stopped at the jail
gate and taken George with him.
A telephone message from Norburn says
a team arrived there at 10 o'clock, "that
had been driven very hard, but we cannot
learn that the driver was Leonard."
Parties are out looking for George, and
telegrams have been sent in every direc
tion. A telegram just received from
Browning says a special train from there
will reach here before daylight with a large
posse. Excitement is intense. The streets
are lined with people, and all are anxious
to see Taylor recaptured.
TILLMAN ON WATTERSON
The South Carolina Senator's
Contempt for the Kentucky
Journalist.
Says He Would Rather Cut His Throat
Than Follow Carlisle and
Cleveland.
LEXINGTON, Ky., April 11.â Senator
Tillman of South Carolina made his first
sneech in Kentucky at 2 o'clock this after
noon in the Lexington Auditorium. The
audience filled the house, a great many
ladles being present. He was introduced
by Rev. W. T. howling, a distinguished
Methodist minister.
When Senator Tillman arose to speak
he was cheered to the echo. He said little
about silver, devoting nearly all his time
to Secretary Carlisle, President Cleveland,
Henry Watterson and the press of the
country.
In referring to Mr. Watterson he said he
pitied him ; that for years ho bad taught
true Democracy to the Kentuckians, but
"when his master told him to undo the
good work he had done he did his bidding. "
He asserted that he would rather cut bis
throat than remain in such employ longer.
He said he had always been a Democrat
and tois ancestors before him, "but if Car
lisle and Cleveland are to set tne pace for
Democrats I will declare myself to be no
Democrat. I:
He praised Senator Blackburn for re
maining in the silver ranks and abused
that wine of the party which caused his
defeat. He told his hearers that they were
cowards to allow the sound-money Demo
crats to remain in power and that they
would be forever ruined if they permitted
the rings of the various counties to send
delegates to the State convention who
would pass resolutions indorsing Carlisle
for President.

An Interesting Controversy
Grows Out of a
Contract.
CLAIMS OF COLLUSION.
The Secretary of Agriculture
Not at All Disturbed by
the Allegations.
COUKTS AN INVESTIGATION.
Declares That Articles of Impeach
ment Should Bi Drawn Up and
the Matter TesteJ.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 11.â The
Northrup-Braslan-Goodwin Company of
Chicago, bidders to supply tb.e Agricul
tural Department with vegetable seed, has
preferred charges against Secretary Mor
ton in connection with the award. The
firm named bid $64,000 for the contract
and offered to make a reduction for tho
privilege of placing its name upon the seed
packages. The contract was awarded to
Landreth & Sons of Philadelphia for
$70,000. Tie charges were filed at the De
partment of Agriculture on Tuesday last
against the Secretary and the officers in his
department, alleging "collusion, fraud
and false statements."
To these charges Secretary Morton haa
not made specific answer. The Chicago
firm say they take exception to the state
ments alleged to have been made by the
Secretary in connection with the awarding
of the contract, but they have no com
plaint to make that the contract was given
to another firm if the terms were better or
more advantageous to the Government.
They say they will endeavor to have the
matter investigated by Congress, if neces
sary, and that they have retained counsel
to proceed against Secretary Morton for
making statements they deem libelous.
In referring to the charges Secretary
Morton said:
"We shall be only too glad to have the
fullest investigation possible of this mat
ter. If it is desired, it may be investigated
here or in Congress or anywhere else. If
necessary articles of impeachment should
be drawn up against me and the matter
tested to the end.
'â¢The facts in the matter briefly stated
are that the department last year bought
more seed of tbi3 firm than of any other.
Of the grand total of seed bought by the
department last year to the value of Â£ltf,
--830 we bought of the Northrup-Braslan-
Goodwin Compaay seed to the value of
Â£.'9,683.
"If we bad bought the seed this spring
of the Northrup-Braslan-Goodwin Com
pany under precisely the same contract
that we bought of Landreth, and their seed
under the contract proved no better than
that they sold us last year, their contract
price for it would be $48,000 instead of
$64,000, the amount which they bid."

BERLIN, Gebmahy, April 11.â The an
nual congress of the German Adelstag
(the nobility) was convened to-day.
Among the questions discussed of spe
cial interest to the aristocracy of Germany
was that of the duelio apropos of the inci
dents which are now exciting society ana
the general public alike. This question
was discussed exhaustively, and it was
finally resolved as the result of the debate j
that it is not a brand of dishonor fora j
nobleman to refuse to tight a duel if the j
grounds of bis refusal are honorable. It!
was also agreed to appoint a court of honor !
\ :i \v to the regulation of such dif
ferences as have hitherto been referred to
the duel conn, which had as its fixed prin- i
ciple the settlement of disputes by pistol :
or rapier. This pronouncement, together
with the growing force of current opinion
in regard to the code duello, may have the
to modify the existing custom, but
it is doubtful whether it will be efficacious ]
in < radicating it, us it is generally felt that '
the custom is too tirnily fixed.
The Emperor's prohibitory order against
ng has utterly failed to lessen the
tics; indeed, dueling has been more
frequent since the issuance of the Kaiser's
decree than evr before.
The duel which was fought between
Lieberecht yon Kotze and Baron yon
Schrader near Potsdam yesterday fur
nishes an instance of the difficulty of get
ting a quarrel settled by means of a court
of honor. The friends of both of these
princi] â  were unceasing in their efforts
to prevent a tight, but courts of honor com
posed of officers of two regiments, instead
of making an attempt to reach a pacific
settlement of the affair, decided that Yon
Kotze ought to accept a challenge from
Yon Schrader. Yon Kotze used this
method of settling his charges against Yon
Bchrader, whereupon these courts decided
tbat in the event of his refusal to accept
the challenge he must at once cease to be
an officer.
The Emperor at this juncture inter
. urfrinir Baron yon Schrader to re- â 
â¢ pt the decision of the courts of j
honor, whi.e near relatives of both the !
disputants entreated them not to engage |
in a duel for fear oi the sociitl odium that
would attach to the encounter. The
le i,:<- that the leading section of so
ciety would cut them, however, finally
compelled them to tight.
Baron yon Schrader died from his wound
_-iiT.
Yon Kotze confidently expects to be im
prisoned in a fortress for his part in the
duel. His second in the duel, Captain yon
Kotze. and yon trchrader's second, General
yon Bissing, will also be sent to a fortress
without doubt. The publicare now asking
tin- question whether the Emperor will
take other measures to show his displeas
ure and his discountenance of future
dueling.
The Yossische Zeitung, in an article on
the subject, says:
"When high Court sets an example of
law-breaking it is mockery to asicl the
people to unite in a struggle to defend
>â¡ and morality. Yon Kotze has
more affairs cf the same kind on hand.
there be more victims and nothing
dune to prevent these sacrifices? Can the
rters of dueling believe that the
of such an encounter proves that one
r. 'in batant is right and the other wrong?
It is a liurbarous reference to the ordeal
and <lis-j_ r r:tceful to modern ideas, making
the aristocracy contemptible in the eyes of
the social democracy. 7 '
celebrated Professor Langerhaus,
al director of the Moabite Hospital,
who startled Berlin by causing the follow
ing announcement to be published in the
ra on Wednesday, "Our darling
Ernest, aged 21 months, died suddenly in
perfect health in consequence of an injec
tion of Dr. Behring's diphtheria serum,"
fol loved up bin statement by a repetition
of the publication together with an an
nouncement giving the date and place of
the funeral, all of which was printed in
lnr^e type.
Ttip publications created a degree of ex
citement which has reached beyond med
icaJ circles, and a lively discussion of the
raauer is now going on in the press. The
body of the child is still in possession of
the authorities, who at once seized it after
the father's announcement. Immediately
after the death of his son Professor Lan
gerhaus sealed a phial containing the
Btrum used in giving the alleged fatal in- i
jection. The professor states that his son j
was in strong health and was inoculated i
with serum merely as a precaution, a j
maid in the family having dipth- '
theria, and he having lost two children in
95 from the same disease. The adherents i
of Dr. Beiiringa^k fora suspension of pro- j
tnal judgment and a calming of the !
public mind until the cause of the death
of the child is proved.
It is learned from an inner course that
the Emperor's desire that the Prince of
Fuerhtenberg shall accept the office of
Chiei Marshal of the imperial court is
associated with his intention to appoint
trim in succession to Prince Hohenlohe,
the Imperial Chancellor. This is taken
us a sign that the hitter's influence Is wan
ing.
The Hamburg Correspondenz alleges
that a difference exists between Chancellor
yon ilohenlohe and Dr. Miquel, the Prus
-Bion Minister of Finance, over the conver
sion of the Prussian fours. The truth la
that the Prussian Cabinet agreed to the
conversion as he proposed. Dr. Miquel is
aware that the attacks which are being
made upon him emanate from underlings
la the Foreign Office, and he treats tLem
as harmless.
Hon. p:dwin F. TJhl, the newly appointed

KANSAS EDITORS FIGHT
At the Fifth Shot an Innocent
Bystander Falls Mortally
Wounded.
Fatal Culmination of a Bitter Rivalry
Over Country Print
ing.
WELLINGTON, Kaxb., April 11.â A
dreadful tragedy was enacted at South
Haven, in this county, yesterday. It was
the culmination of a bitter war between
rival newspaper editors, and Charles
Branscomb, editor of the South Haven
New Era, was the innocent victim.
Robert Simmons, editor of the Cald well
News, and A. A. Richards, editor of the
Wellington Daily Mail, became involved
in a newspaper fight over the county
printing about a year ai;o, and recently
both have indulged in bitter personalities.
A recent article in the Mail especially
severe on the editor of the News pro
voked the encounter.
Simmons and his sick wife were on the
northbound 'Frisco accommodation yes
terday, en route home, and when the train
stopped at Souih Haven for passengers,
Simmons stepped to the depot platform.
A. A. Richards and Charles Branscomb
met him there by chance. Richards and
Simmons quarreled, and both became
wildly excited, drawing revolvers and tir
ing at each other. At the fifth shot lirans
comb fell forward, exclaiming: "My God,
I'm shot ."
Bystanders rushed in and disarmed the
rivals, and an examination showed that
Branscomb was fatally wounded. He lin
gered until to-night.
No arrests have yet been made. It is
not known which man fired the fatal shot.
Bran-comb was a warm personal friend of
Colonel Richards. The affair has created
a profound sensation.

Before the Middle of

LONDON, Exg., April 11.-As far aa it
has gone, the Soudan expedition is disap
pointing to the War Office and the Gov
ernment. Dispatches are Eent daily from
Cairo praising the rapidity of the move
ments at the front and the completeness
of the preparations. The truth, as known
at the War Office, which is sustained by
private advices, is that the advance be
yond Assouan is excessively alow, being
hampered by deficient river service and
want of forage. The worst feature for the
Government is the enormous and unex
pected expenditures that have been and
are yet to be made.
Lord Cromer, the British diplomatic
agent at Cairo, advises that it will be early
necessary to draw upon the Egyptian
treasury for Â£1,000,000 in addition to the
Â£500,000 already drawn, and this fact ren
ders it probable that the entire reserve of
the Egyptian debt commission will be ul
timately absorbed in preparations before
there is an actual contract with the Der
vishes. No authority ventures to specu
late as to what will happen when the re
serve is exhausted.
Until September the only forward move
ment from Akasheh that is likely to be
made will be to Firket, ten miles up the
river. This will be merely due to the dis
covery that Akasheh is a bad strategic
point. The place is surrounded by low
hills commanding the camp, and for this
reason it has already been found advisable
to form a chain of forts in the hills. The
sanitation of the camp is bad. The mer
cury reaches an average of 106 de;;. in the
shade and this extreme heat impedes the
work of even the Fellaheen laborers. At
Wady-Halfa a large number of men be
longing to the North Staffordshire Regi
ment have been invalided by the heat.
That no operations of importance are in
tended daring the summer is evident from
the fact that General Sir Redvers Buller is
reported to have been nominated for the
chief command of the expedition. He
will not leave England until July, when
the campaign will be fairly entered upon.
The Nile will be the sole line of advance.

Kruffer and Chamberlain.
LONDON, Exg., April 11.â The com
munications that are passing between
Chamberlain and President Kruger, will,
when published, be found to be models of
franK and direct statement on the part of
the former and of diplomatic finesse, veiled
with an air of simplicity, on the part of the
latter.
The representative of The United Press
is able to predict, on thoroughly reliable
information, that Mr. Chamberlain will
come out of the negotiations with a high
reputation. Throughout the communica
tions he has not budged from his public
declarations to adhere to the Anglo-Boer
convention of 1884, while respecting the
internal independence of the republic.
Whether the country will ultimately
confirm Chamberlain's policy is doubtful,
but it is impossible that the developments
will show him to have been duped by
President Kruger. The present clause era
powers the Transvaal to conclude treaties
with foreign powers, subject to the veto of
Great Britain. This clause Chamberlain
has sought to have altered by making
Great Britain a party to the treaties on
lines similar to those existing in
the case of Great Britain and her
colonies. With regard to the protec
tion of foreinn residents of the republic,
Chamberlain continues to recommend that
franchise be given to them after rive years,
and also recommends autonomy for the
Rand, the measures there adopted to be
subject to the veto power of the President.
To none of these proposals has President
Kru^er definitely assented. The position
just misses a deadlock through the 'shifti
ness of the Pretoria Government. A re
port is credited that Chamberlain has asked
the assent of his colleagues to a proposal
not to wait for the decision of the Volks
road regarding the visit of Kruger to
London, but to send a plenipotentiary to
Pretoria as a last effort to arrange the
terms of settlement.

Great Secrecy Was Maintained by the

LONDON, Exo., April 11.â Sun
publishes a Constantinople dispatch to a
news agency here stating that the Turkish
officials at Bitlis received orders from per
sons in high authority to expel the Rev.
G. P. Knapp, the American missionary,
from that place. The . dispatch further
states that but for Mr. Ilampson, the
British Consul at Bitlis. the expulsion of
Knapp would not have been known until
he had reached Alexandretta. As it was
the matter had been conducted so secretly
that Missionary Knapp had been ex

HAVANA, Cuba, April 11 (via Key
We3t, Fla., April 11). â The insurgent
forces operating in many parts of the
island have been aggressive the past week.
Half a dozen towns in Havana province
alone have been attacked. The troops in
variably remain safely cooped up in forts,
allowing the rebels full swing. All avail
able Spanish troops are stationed on the
Trocha between Mariel and Majana to pre
yent the return of Maceo to Havana.
A score of small parties of insurgents
united with Lacrete'B column and others
from the east have gathered on the Havana
side of the line with the apparent inten-.
tion of aiding Maceo to cross. The
Spaniards are satisfied that Maceo is
dooniod. The Cubans say he can cross
when he pleases. The Spaniards have
25,000 men along the line. Maceo has
10,000 in his column; 5000 others are west
and about 5000 east of the line.
Aside from these operations 3000 insur
erents have appeared fifteen miles east of
Havana. Their purpose is not clear.
Gomez is reported in the vicinity of the
Puerto Principe line. One object of his
march east is to receive arms and ammu
nition landed on the recent trip of the
Commodore on the north coast of Cama-
guey.
Reports received from reliable sources
state that General Melguizo, Colonels Mo
tina and Tort and others continue killing
peaceable Cubans. Melguizo is said to have
killed nine employes on estates in the
vicinity of Campo Florido. Afterward,
boasting of the deed, he said: "The pa
cificos are the worst kind of rebels. All
should be swept off."
General Prats' column operating against
Lacrete had a skirmish with the rear
guard of the rebels on April 2 on Nievez
estate near Limonar, Matanza*. The
estate belongs to a French citizen, M. de
Freville. The rebels reiired without losses.
Colonel Prats, son of the general, was
wounded on the Spanish side. The troops
took four men, colonists on the estate,
from the houses and shot them through
the bodies. The cane fields were fired.

What Colonial Leaders Think of Cham

LONDON, Eng.;' April 11.â The Statist

leaders asking their opinion of the recent
I speech of Mr. Chamberlain, Colonial Sec
-1 retary, advocating a commercial union of
I the colonies. In reply to this letter J.
â  Hofmeier, leader of the* Afrikander party,
I has cabled from Cape Town expressing his
i opinion that tne proposal embodies an ex

will render it impossible at present in
South Africa and many other colonies.
C. C. Kingston, Crown Advocate of
I South Australia, cabled merely that the
j subject ought to be courteously and care

The Australian press is generally hos

Spread of Glanders at Liverpool.
LONDON", Eire., April 11.â A committee
of the Health Board of Liverpool which

horses in that city is due to the importa
tion of Canadian horses. The committee
is about to urge the Government to take
restrictive action upon the importntion of
such animals. The allegation of the Liv
erpool committee is emphatically denied
by Canadian officials.

OF PALO ALTO.
Two Successful Renditions
of the Opera "Said
Pasha."
STUDENTS WIN PRAISE.
Efforts of Professionals Rivaled
by the Amateur Talent
of Stanford.
FERRIS HARTMAN'S DOUBLE.
Clever Performance of the Personator
of Hadadâ "Co-Eds" in Harem
Costume.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
11. â The opera "Said Pasha" by Stanford
students, as presented last night and re
peated this evening, was a decided success
and a surprise to most of those who heard
it. There has never been a theatrical
attempt here on a more extensive scale
than this, and none ihat has met with
euch satisfactory results. Last year the
opera "Pinafore" was well rendered by
students, but the chorus was smaller,
the Feenory and costumes less elaborate.
The individual work, too, of the principal
characters was hardly as good and cer
tainly no better than in "Said Pasha."
The scenery w-as the sama as that used
in the Tivoii at San Francisco, a:id con
sidering the fact that there are no arrange
ments for hanging and shifting it in the
Encina gymnasium the work was done in
a surprisingly short space of time. The
longest wait wÂ»s between the first and
second acts, wi.. c the scene changes from
one on shipboard to one in the Rajah's
palace. A specially noteworthy feature of
the performance was the electrical effects.
All the work of wiring the gymnasium for
brilliant lighting dt-volved on E. C. Hay
ward, a student in electrical engineering.
He was assisted by G. R. Greenleaf and
H. T. Copetand,
The participants in this opera have been
rehearsing for the past three months, and
had drilled themselves into their parts by
persistent hard work. Almost the entire
burden of directing the rehearsals and
bringing off the opera was borne by H. D.
Comtek, '97. The fact that there was not
a halt or a break in uny role is the result
of the vigilant work of this director.
The gymnasium was packed to its full
seating capacity both last night and this
evening, and, t ouch the expense 3 were
heavy, Treasurer Hinshell believes the
student body will make something from
the venture. Nearly ail the professors,
with their wives anil families, were on
hand the opening night. Before the cur
tain roiled uji and letween acts the stu
dents amused themselves by whistling fa
vorite airs and "joshing" various indi
viduals in the audience. All "grinds"
and "hits" made by the comedians of the
eveningâ Baldwin '96 and Dillon '99â
were applauded to the echo and encore after
encore was demanded. The fact that the
final downfall of the curtain didnot take
place until midnight is partly explained
by these numerous encores. Bouquets
were plentiful, and the leading ladies were
well remembered.
In their adaptation of "Said Pasha" the
students introduced many laughable local
hits. One especially appreciated was got
off by NocKey, who is awakened from
a horrible dream by Had aI. Regaining
conciousness under Hadad's violent treat
ment he shivers with horror a:ul ejacu
lates: "I had an awful dream! I thought
we gave a third concert at Fresno!" The
fact that the Glee Club gave two concerts
at Fresno to empty benches on its recent
trip explains the hit, which convulsed the
house.
There were fully seventy students in the
cast, which made the chorus remarkably
fctronc- The effects of Pasraore's voice
training could be heard to pood advantage
la?t evening.
Baldwin and Diilon undoubtedly carried
off the honors of the evening among the
male characters. Baldwin, as Hadad, ren
dered his role with the skill of a Ferris
Hartman, whose interpretation at the
Tivoli Baldwin has been studying for
some time. DUIoI. is a natural comedian,
and though a new student here has already
NEW TO-DAY.
RUIN
MISERY
WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE VOUNQ
MEN OF THE DAY?
Cigarette smoking is one of the evils
which is fast increasing among the young
men of the period. It is an age of nervous-
ness; nervous excitement, nervous weak-
ness and debility is the growing malady of
the day. Minds are over - burdened in
school, the pleasures of social life follow
business worry ; intemperance, sexual ex-
cesses or abuses over excite the already
enfeebled nerves and result in exhausting
diseases or drains upon the nervous system.
It's a drag and a handicap to every
young man to be a sufferer from nervous
debility or weakness, low spirits, irritable
temper, impaired memory, loss of will-
power, and the thousand and one derange-
ments of mind and body that result from
pernicious habits often contracted through
ignorance of nature's laws. The wreck of
constitution, weakened vitality and manly
power, following such habits would be a
sorry ending to life in this splendid age of
learning and labor. It will fast become an
age of unsettled brains and shattered nerves
unless our young men knoza themselves.
To reach, re-claim and restore such
unfortunates to health and happiness is
the aim of the publishers of a book of
136 pages, written in plain but chaste
language, on the nature, symptoms and
curability, by horne -treatment, of ?ueh
diseases. This book will be sent sealed,
in plain envelope, on receipt of tbis nol
tice with ten cents in stamps, for postage.
Address, World's Dispensary Medical As-
sociation, Buffalo, N. Y.
For more than a quarter of a century
physicians connected with this widely
celebrated Institution have made the treat-
ment of the diseases hinted at above their
specialty. Thousands have consulted them
by letter and received advice and medi-
cines which have resulted in permanent
cures.
Sufferers from premature old age. or IOS9
3f power, will find much of interest in the
book above mentioned.
made hiniselt known as a clever amateur
on the stage. He received his training in
Portland theaters.
George Bush '98, as Said Pasha, made a
satisfactory king, and sang in better form
than ordinarily. F. P. Abbott, from an
artistic standpoint, was the best singer of
the evening. His Hassen Bey, the devoted
lover, was a good bit of work; but his
voice lacked fire. Terano was assigned to
W. A. Sutherland, who has a very sweet
voice, but is not certain on i ho upper notes.
Unlike most dashing Mexicans, Suther
land made Terano appear as if suffering
fram a fatal attack of sleepiness and
ennui, while the nervousness of the ideal
hunting Terano was quite perceptible.
Xothing but praise could be given the
female churacters. True, the unaccus
tomed garments bothered the women
somewhatâ the traditional vestments of
harem beauties are enough to worry the
nineteenth century maidensâ but for all
that tho girls were accorded but merited
praise for their work.
Miss Farrel as Belah Sojah, made the
most of her serio-comic role. She entered
with zest into the delineation of the sus
ceptible female on the wrong side of thirty,
and appeared at ease in her part. Miss
McMillan sang Serena's part in excellent
voice. Miss Mann's interpretation of
Alti was very favorably commented upon.
She has a voice of utmost clearness and
wide range. Her ''make-up M as the
Rajah's daughter was above anticipation.
Taken all in all tbe opera will long be
remembered as another victory for Stan
ford enterprise. The second performance,
given this evening, was better in finish
than that of last evening.

YOLO JURY DISAGREES
Fails to Reach a Verdict in a
Case Important to Hop-
Growers.
Litigation Affecting Contracts Entered
Into by a San Francisco
Firm.
WOODLAND, Cal.. April 11.â The ca?e
of I'hlrnan & Co., Ban Francisco hop
deaiers.vs. Wylie <fc Casselman, hop-growers
of Yolo County, which has been stubbornly
contested before a jury in the Superior
Court the past three weeks, was concluded
to-day, the jury disagreeing after a ions
wrangle.
Not only were Feveral thousand doliars
involved in the result of the suit, but a3 a
test case it would have affneted hundreds
of hop-growers along the Sacramento
River in this county, under similar con
tracts. In May of la<a year Uhlman <fc
Co. entered into a contract with Wylie &
Casselman to buy their hop* for five years
at 9 ceuts per pound and later advanced
$1700 to be expended for picking. When
the hops were baled Ãblman & Co. pent
their a^ent to the ranch. He examined
the hops and declined to take them, on
the ground that they did not come up to
certain conditions named In the contract.
Bait was commenced last August against
Wylie & Casselman to recover the amount
of money advanced on promissory notes,
and an attachment was placed on the hops.
The crop was sold upon un order of the
Superior Court at public auction for 3
cents per pound.
The defendants filed a cross-ccmplaint,
alleging that the notes were given as re
ceipts for the money advanced to them,
and asked for damages in $4UOu, the dif
ference between the sum they had already
received and the amount called for in the
contract.
One of ihe main contentions in the case
was as to the quality and soundness of the
hops, and on this point more than forty
witnesses were examined and niueri con
tradictory testimony adduced. The jury
stood eifjhc for the plaintiffs to three for
the defendants.
PHOENIX DEFALCATION.
County Supervisors Likely to Be Prose
cuted Because of the Peculations
of a Clerk.
PHCEXIX, Ariz., April U.â The Grand
Jury, which met several months a>:o, made
an exhaustive examination of the books of
the various county olticers and charged
the Supervisors with gross carelessness in
spending the county's money, especially
on road work and jaii contracts. The
books of the board were in such bad shape
that the jury could not check them up in
the limited time it had to work, but it rec
ommended the dismissal of Clerk E. B.
KirKland and the appointment of a more
competent person. This was done. The
jury brought in no indictment against
the Supervisors and, consequently, some
of the heaviest taxpayers of the* county
formed a Citizen's Leacue to make further
inveotitrations and take such steps as
seemed necessary for redress.
It was soon discovered that Clerk Kirk
land was a defaulter to tue amount of $750,
but nis friends returned this sum to the
county and he was not prosecuted. Since
that time other shortages have been dis
covered from time to time, which will in
crease the total defalcation to about $1000.
Kirkland has left the county.
The league has been working secretly
and holding weekly meeting* and on Mon
day the result of the investigations is to
be made public. It is learned on goou
authority that it had been decided to be
gin a criminal action agaiuat the Super
visors.

Gathering of Farmer* of ban Joaquin
County at /Stockton.
STOCKTON, Cai... April 11.â There was
a gathering of farmers from a!l parts of
tue county at Fraternal Hall this morn
ing, the occasion being a special meeting
of Pomona Grange, which is made up of
all the subordinate granges in this section.
C. W. Norton, the master of the grange,
was the first speaker, and he was followed
by Waiter Greer, worthy master of the
Plate (trangp. who spoke briefly, and then
intioduced Past Muster Daniel Flint of
Sacramento, the speaker of the day.
Flint's suhjec*, was, "The Declaration of
Purposes of the Grange." From the
declaration oi r>rinciples the speaker went
to the benefits that had accrued to all
those joining the grange, and shoved that
much more intelligent farming had re
sulted from the work of the organization.
The farmers had been brought closer to
gether, Jie said, and had learned much
from the frequent meetings of the progress
in Otfa t places, of new machinery for cul
tivating ihe soil, and in this way had re
ceived practical benefit, as well as enjoyed
ihe social features connected with the
grange meetings.
In the afternoon Professor Wickson of
the State University addressed the meet
ing.

SASTA ROSA CONTEST.
Street CommiÂ»Â»ioner Com ad Mefusea to
Vacate Mis Office.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., April. Politi
cal circles were profoundly stirred this
afternoon when it was definitely known
that D. W. Cozad bad filed a complaint
contesting the election of John McMinn
to the office of Street Commissioner.
The complaint Is short and to the point,
alleging that McMinn, the Democratic
nominee, and Carleton, the Republican
nominee, were members of the American
Protective Association, and that just be
fore the election the two candidates agreed
to pool their issues to defeat Cozad, who
was then the holder of the office and in the
field again, independent of party ties. The
complaint fanner declares that to procure
the indorsement of the American Protec
tive Association McMinn paid to Carleton
a sum of money and airreed to give him a
place on the street work; that Carleton ac
cepted the money and offer of work and in
return induced his irieuds to vote for Mc-
I Minn. Cozad charges that McMinn's
statement of expenses did not include the
amount paid to Carleton.
Cozad has refused to .give up the tools
and supplies of his office and says he has
proof lor all of his allegations. Judge
Crawford fixed on April 29 as a special day
on which to hear the case.

WOODLAND, Cal., April 11. â The
American Protective Association in Wood
land is jubilant to-night over the primary
election held to-day in this city. Of the
twenty-six delegates to the county con
vention, all but two are members of the
local association, and these two were in
dorsed by the order.
Through some mistake the chairman of
the Republican County Central Committee
failed to call a public caucus prior to the
election, and the customary slate was not
in evidence. This morniner they consid
ered it too late to caucus. But it" was dif
ferent with the American Protective Asso
ciation. Three hundred of its Republican
members secretly caucused on the evening
previous to the election, systematically
arranged their plans and appointed their
ward committees with the result that they
carried the day without opposition.

SAVED TO SANTA CRUZ
The Cooper Courthouse Site Still
Remains in Possession of
the City.
Court Held in a Quaint Shanty That
Smacks cf the Early
Fifties.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April 11.â When
Judge Logan instructed Sheriff Besse to
announce the convoking of the Superior
Court fur Santa Cruz County this morn
ing he looked about the narrow room of
his temporary courthouse and .-miled. The
humor of the situation seemed to have
caught the audience, among which were
the members of the Board of Supervisors.
The neat little shanty hastily put together
for the preservation of the title to the land
gift from the Cooper estate stands in the
shadow of the new brick and stone struc
ture in course of construction and looks
more like a contractor's toolhouse than a
place for holding court. There was prac
tically no work to be done by the court to
day.
One small order was made and Clerk Ed
Martin was instructed to enter an order
declaring the removal of the court from
the Hotaling building on Front btreet to
the present abode of justice. When court
adjourned it was until Monday next, and
on that day the regular business will pro
ceed as usual.
The half hunched spectators who looked
upon the proceedings this morning seemed
divided in sentiment between the serious
and jocular aspect of a situation that ne
cessitates the holding of court in this
small wooden building.
It reminded many of them of the days
of the uioneer courts, though the carpeted
floor and papered walls reflected a chancre.
The more serious passed upon the causes
that have made this wooden building a
necessity, and regretted that Santa Cruz
County had suffered the indignity of un
necessary delay. Another cause for delay
in the construction of the new building
came up to-day in the refusal of the terra
cotta workers to proceed with extra work
in the lining of the vaults until Superin
tendent Beck shall guarantee their pay
ment. This difference will probably be
adjusted by Monday and the work proceed.

SHERIFF BUEE'S DISCOVEEY.
Finds Clothing Corresponding to That
Worn by the Postoffice
Robbers.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 11.â The
murderers of Postmaster John Hayes Jr.
of Puente have been captured ; at least,
two brothers are in the County Jail
charged with the offense. They are B. W.
and Georg* D. Ming, residents of Puente.
Sheriff Burr brought the prisoners with
him yesterday evening upon his return
from the scene of the tnuredy. He kept
tneir names and the fact of their arrest
for the murder secret until to-day, as he
was not altogether satisfied that he had
the right men. To-day, however, he filed
complaints against them and had them
formally arraigned for the murder before
Justice Young, who held them for exami
nation without bail.
The Ming brot era are laborers and have
lived at Puente for many years. Their ac
quaintance and former association with
the Cummings desperadoes of El Monte
directed suspicion toward them. An oil
coat, a linen duster and a white hat, cor
responding to those worn by the robbers,
were found at their house, and were the
primary cause of their arrest. Other cir
cumstantial evidence has been unearthed,
but they steadily protest their innocence.
The murdered man's body was shipped
to San Francisco to-day.

ROSA'S QUEEN
Mrs. L. W. Burris Chosen
to Rule Over the
Carnival.
A POPULAR SELECTION.
Beauty and Amiability Win a
Victory ior the Wheelmen's
Candidate.
GIVEN A HEAVY PLURALITY.
Over Eleven Thousand Votes Cast for
the Belle Who S.cured the
Crown.
SANTA ROSA, Cat.., April 11.â Mrs. L.
Vi'. Burris will reign over the Carnival of
Roses. To-night, when the votes wore
counted for the last time, she was declared
MRS. L. W. BVRRIS. QUEER OF THE SANTA ROSA CARNIVAL.
[From her. latent jthotngraph.]
queen by an overwhelming majority. The
queen-elect is a handsome demi-brunette,
â with large, expressive eyes, from whose
dark depths beam kindness and eood will.
She is of high social standing and has all
of the attributes of one born to rule, but
the unfailing kindness of manner and
sweet disposition of this lady counted far
more than wealth or beauty in the race,
and fully explain the immense vote re
ceived by the popular queen of the Rdse
Carnival of 18'J6.
Between the hours of 7 and 9 o'clock
the excitement was intense, and nearly
$~Â«Q went into the box. Great crowds
red at the polling-place early to
watch the voting, and as each envelope
was deposited in the box shrewd guesses
were made as to whom their contents
werÂ»' for. J'.y 8 o'clock the balloting had
commenced in earnest, and it became ap
rarent to all that an immense vote would
be cast. Friends of both Santa Rosa can
didates surrounded the box, vainly trying
to figure out the tactics of their contest
ants. The supporters of Miss Sara Hall
were numerous, but were unprepared for
MISS ANGIE PRIXCEVALLE, A SAN MATEO COUNTY BELLE.
[From a photograph.}
the thousands of votes that were being
rained into the box for Mrs. Burris.
A few minutes before the box closed
three well-known gentlemen entered and
quite ostentatiously prepared their ballots,
lettinc people see their golden offerings
before sealing the envelopes. As these
three gentlemen were all known to be in
the Burris camp the news quickly reached
the opposition and double the amount
suppo.-ed to have just been voted was
quiv'kly deposited for Miss Hall. But it
now appears that a joker was concealed in
each of the three envelopes in the shape of
a snugly concealed check segregating
more lhan 5000 vote*. It was known that
the Panta Rosa Wheelmen, of whom there
are about 100, had decided ro support Mrs.
Burris and when Captain Ramuge depos
ited a modest-looking envelope in the box
every one knew for whom it would be
counted. But the fact that this little offer
of the wheelmen wÂ«s a block of 2500 votes
became soon known to all in the room and
caused moÂ«t of the spectators to guess the
winner with great accuracy.
The total number of votes oast for Mrs.
Burris was 11,109, Miss Hall, the next on
the list, having about 2000. The redwoods
belle, Miss Jessica Kloppenburg, gained
about 500 during the day, raakinc a total
of about 1000 for her, and the scattering
vote was fully 3000. The extremely large
vote cast for Mrs. Burris is a small token
of the regard in which she is held in Santa
Rosa. That the choice was a popular one
was evinced by the loud cheer of approval
and the gleeful accents in which the event
was heralded by people of all degrees.

to the street parade.

REDWOOD CITY. Cat,., April 11.â The
contest for queen of the rose carnival
grows more interesting from day to day,
and at least four places â Menlo Park, ban
Mateo, South San Francisco and â Wood
side â claim they will send the young lady
who will wear the crown.
Miss Henrietta Lawler of Menlo Park is
now in the lead and her friends claim that
she is good for ever so many votes, but
Miss Annie Goggin of South San Fran
cisco has votes in *iocks of hundreds and
the whole district is said to be pooled to
elect her. There is a great deal of interest
to learn more about Miss Goggin, who up
to Thursday led the whole county in the
voting. She is said to be a handsome
blonde, just merging from her teens, and
of a most charitable disposition. Miss
Lawler of Menlo Park is also a young lady
of pronounced beauty. These are the
principal contestants at present.
â \Voo<lside has a worthy candidate in the
fair and queenly Miss Lillian Neuman.
Her name iias only just been mentioned
for honors, but she is sure of a handsome
vote from the enterprising people of the
Portola Valley.
San Mateo is tue unknown quantity. It
is conceded that San Mateo can eiect the
queen if the word is giyen, and it is whis
pered that at the last moment San Mateo
will win. Redwood City has several can
didates, witli Miss Ollie Christ now lead
ing and Miss Nellie Hammerson of Menlo
Park a close second. Miss Hainmerson
has numerous friends in Belruont, Red
wood City and Menlo Park, ana this popu
lar young lady may yet reign at the carni
val ball. Miss Angle Princevalle, who
presides over one of the voting booths at
Rciwood City, is also in nomination, and
her friends insist upon giving her a place
among the leaders.

he could draw the money, but instead
of turning it over to Materri he spent it for
liquor. Owens -was taken to Saratoga by

CADMUS WAS A SURPRISE
Captured the Rich Ormonde
Stake From the Prohibitive
Choice Pepper.
A RARE DAY OF SPORT.
Sir Vassar Took the Handicap Im
pressively â Adolph Sprecke'.s
First in an Exciting Drive.
In the way of divertisements a greater
card was never offered than the one fur
nished the race-going public at Ingleside
yesterday. Undoubtedly the big surprise
of the present racing season occurred.
With but two starters in the rich Ormonde
p'.ake over a distance of three miles the 1
to 6 favorite Pepper had to acknowledge
defeat. His conqueror was the stout
hearted Cadmus, carrying the red, whita
a:ul blue colors ol A. B. Spreckels, whose
game race in the great Spreckels handicap,
won by Lissak, endeared him to the hearts
of all local race-gcers.
The big race was the third event of the
day. Of all the original entries Cadmus
and Pepper were the only ones left in to
try for the $2300 prize. Under the condi
tions ot the race Pepper carried 106 pounds
and the books held him at Ito 6. Open
ing at 10 to 1, an inkling of returning
form on ti.e part of Cadmus was con
veyed. whe:i his odds were gradually cut
to 4 >Â«' to 1. at which price he went to the
post."
Cochran had the mount on Pepper,
while Macklin piloted the son of F.ood.
Neither rider seemed anxious to cut out a
very liot pace, and Cadnui3 showed the
way around to the bend for home of the
last niiie. flore Cochran imagined that
all he had to do â¢ras to shake up the brown
horse with the green hood and take the
silken bag down from the wire.
Cadn refused to be shaken, however,
and both boys were seen to beurcing their
mounts. There was more or less bumping
about â  furlong from the finish, in which
Cadmus came out first best, nnd he passed
the wire amid great cheering, an easy win
ner by four lengths in 0:4." : .
CoeÂ«;ran. the rider of Pepper, insti
tuted a claim of foul, bnt according to the
report of Patrol Judge Carson, he nimself
w.ts tie first argn>-Â«or and the foul was
r.ot allowed. This decision was the signal
for another outburst of cheering from the
biir crowd that had collected around the
judges' stand, for the victory was a most
} opular one.
The programme was a very lengthy one,
it being after 6 o'clock before the last race
was decided. The attendance was larsre,
end the revival of heat racing was a de
cidedly popular innovation. The favorites '
were worsted, but two of them reaching
rst.

parently had a very easy ride, a close sec

On the strength of his good showing Dun

second heat, and in a hard drive beat
Tonino out a nose. In the run-off the
black horse, who was now a 1 to 3 favorite,
â¢ easily disposed of Tonino at the end, and
; tooK the purse and race by two open
lengths.
â¢'Tom" Griffin's Kentucky Derby candi
date, Sir Vassar, disposed of his lie:d in
I the mile and a sixteenth handicap most
impressively. Starting an S to 5 favorite
;he made all of the running, splendidly
i rated by Piggott, passed the judges two
! lengths in advance of St. Lee, who came
j with a fine showing of sneed at the end,
taking the place from Service by half a
length.
For the mile and three-furlong handi
cap, Sir Reel held sway in the betting,
backed down from twos to 8 to 5, but the
I nandicapper was altogether too liberal in
I allo. ting weight on the old sulker and he
I ran unplaced. Templemore took the five
hurdles in front, but tired when pressed
by Silverado ana gave up the lead. The
Corrigan "lepper" seemed to hold the race
safe, but in the last tew yards was passed
and beaten out handily by April, a 3 to 1
chance in the betting* ridden by W.
i Clancy.
The' last race at seven furlongs, decided
! under selling conditions, furnished one of
! the prettiest contests of the day. Five
: started in the race and all of the starters
1 were accorded good support. When the
i horses were called, Unity, at 11 to 5, had a
slight call, with Adolph Spreckels a heav-
I ily-backed second choice. Goodwin 11,
j who opened at twos, receded to 3tol.
i Goodwin II took the lead turning into
1 the back stretch, and swinging into the
: straight for the wire was half a length in
i front of Service, followed by Mosier and
! Adolph Spreckels. The latter colt soon
passed Mosier, and joining the two leaders
the trio had a ding-dong battle '.o the
wire. Slaughter, on Adolph Spreckels,
i rode a grand race and got his horse past
the wire half a length in front of Service.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 12, 1896.
G. W. WILDERMAN'S DEAL
The World's Christian Co-opera
tive President at Nevada
City.
SOME RICH MINES IN BOND.
A Peculiar Social Transaction â Re
pudiating One Society for
Ano'her.
A meeting of the World's Christian Co
operative Society took place at Golden
Rule Hall on Mission street, near Sixth,
last evening, and President Q. W. Wilder
man of the concern was discussed in terms
not complimentary.
It appears that the society recently pur
chased the Cleveland mine, situated on
the Yuba River, eight and a half miles
from Nevada City, from John and J. R.
Tilton. The two parties entered into a
contract whereby the corporation was to
pay the Tiltons $25,000, the former to work
the mine, setting aside 40 per cent of its
earnings as payment for the property.
The society then sent Wilderman as an
expert to examine the purchase. He was
also to pay the taxes on the property,
which were due. He reported that the
Tiltons had no title to the mine nor to two
others which they claimed, and as they
were common property he located all
three in the name of thtt corporation. He
then proposed to extend the World's
Christian Co-operative Society to Nevada
City and said he would appoint five resi
dent directors there if the same number of
the original eleven in this City would re
sign. He also proposed that the society
would buy his claim of 31,000 acres of land
in Lower California, paying in stock which
would be assigned to him. By this means,
it is alleged, lie would be able to control
the corporation and its property.
Tne directors here refused to do so in
very strong terms. Wilderman then cut
loose from the World's Christian, etc., etc.,
and started a new society in Nevada City
called the People's Co-operative Invest
ment Association, with a capital of four
mines representing untold millions out
side of his Lower California acres.
There are many dctailsof this Napoleonic
co-operative campaign, but this is the
history of the affair in a nutshell.
Now the Tiltons want their property
back, and the society wrestled with thÂ°
intricate problem last evening. John Til
den was present and told his plaintive
story of Wilderman's ways, ana the di
rectors present concurred with him in his
unfavorable estimation of their president's
character. They still consider Wilderman
their agent, and all the mines which he
has become possessed of as the property
of the World's Christian Co-operative So
ciety, and that the Nevada City institu
tion has no entity.
Attorney Collier, who was called in for
legal advice, informed them that the
Cleveland mine was their property by vir
tue of the contract; also that Tilton could
only recover the other mines by a suit of
ejection against Wilderman. These gloomy
tiding* affected the luckless Tilton,
and his estimation of "World's Christian
Co-operative concerns sank still lower.
The society itself is not disposed to sur
render any nf the mines, but claims them
all, a^i Wilderman is their president and
accredited agent. Wilderman, however,
repudiates them and their pretensions,
and claims the mines. Tilton is indeed
between the devil and the deep sea.
An effort will be made by the society to
prosecute Wildt-rman.on a criminal chares
it being alleged that he sold stock certifi
cates of the corporation, appropriating
the proceeds to his own use. Attorney-
Collier will be sent to Nevada City to col
lect evidence of Wilderman's " peculiar
business methods and to examine the
property. The members of the society
stated last evening that they will return
the Cleveland mine to Tiltonâ when they
get it from Wilderman and his new asso
ciation, but they will keep the other two
mines. This does not suit Tilton, who
cannot see why Wilderman should jump
his claims.
He says the mines are worth $3,000,000.
YOUTHFUL ATHLETES.
The Boyi of the Lowell High School
Hold a Field Day for Record-
Makers.
The promising athletes of the San Fran
cisco Boys' High School, that may a few
years hence become some of the university
record-makers of the coast, held a field
day yesterday afternoon in the Olympic
Club's grounds, that have recently been
restored to usefulness after being long ob
structed by a landslide.
The weather was cold and raw, and the
performances were not of the record
smashing kind, but the events were well
contested, in spite of the climatic handi-
smashing kind, but the events were well
contested, in spite of the climatic handi
cap.
It was a contest to determine the indi
viduals best fitted to represent tne school
in the coming fieldday of the Academic
Amateur Association, composed of all the
preparatory schools near San Francisco
Hay, and it also decided the ciass cham
pionship of the Lowell High School. The
senior, middle and junior classes entered
men for points, first place in an event
counting five, second three, and third one.
The class of 96 won sixty-eight points;
the class of ' 97 wa3a close second with fifty
points; and the lowest class, naturally
made up of younger boys, had twenty-two
points credited to" '98.
The rival partisans were well represented
in the grand stand, where a large number
of their sympathisers sat, and with
them, shivered, but still looked eagerly on
at the exhibitions of speed and agility.

in which the participants came out, and

STREET LIFE IN ENGLAND
Monsignor Nugent Draws Pic
tures of the Waifs of
English Cities.
DEFENDS THE UNFORTUNATES.
A Large Audience in Metropolitan
Hall Entertained by the Emi
nent Priest,
Monsignor Nugent, the eminent English
prest, told a wonderful story last night in
Metropolitan Hall, and those who heard
the venerable and picturesque visitor were
profoundly impressed by his eloquence,
touched by his pathos and entertained be
yond expression by his humor.
It was a wonderful storyâ "The Waifs
and Strays; Pictures of Street Life in Eng
land" â and one that formed aa entertain
ment long to be remembered.
Metropolitan Hall could not hare con
tained a dozen more people. Admittance
was free and the fame of the Monsignor
attracted an immense throng, so that after
the last seat was occupied fully a thousand
persons packed the aisles, leaving no place
in the whole interior vacant. Nor was the
platform reserved, for anxious men. and
women pressed against it on both sides
and found standing-room there.
H. S. Foqte, United States District At
torney, presided. In a happy speech he
introduced Monsignor Nugent, who was
overwhelmed with applause. The entire
audience applauded, then stood and
cheered for the grand old clergyman.
It was some time before tiit; Monsignor
found an opportunity to speak, and then
he told the audience that its greeting wab
a noble recognition of his efforts in the
cause of humanity. He said mere was no
better place to study mankind than within
the walls of a prison. As chaplain of the
Liverpool prison that fact was impressed
on him. Once he met a young man â a
youth of 21â with a face that did not be
speak a bad heart. Here was a likely sub
ject for reform.
"Try your hand on the kids, sir," ex
c!a:med this prisoner. "Talk to them and
they wiil never see the inside of a stone
jug-"
"Prevention is better than cure,"
thoncht the chaplain, and he acted upon
I the thought.
He said there were 100,000 boys and girls
in London and 25,000 in Liverpoolâ "dirty,
naked, shoeless children; nobody's chil
dren, desolate and homeless wanderers
without a heart to love or a hand to guide
them. ' In them talent and genius was
! running to waste in the gutter, and with
I care and education they would equal tbe
j talent and genins of the upper ten tuou
i sand. Pictures of street Jife were given to
j prove this assertion. The monsignor
I spoke to two urchins on the streets, tiny
\ shoeblacks.
"E oaaal shine your boots, sir," one lad
piped. "Is father is a chimbley sweep,
sir; knows nothing about shining, sir.
I '/Put your toot on my block, sir, and I'll
shine your blooroin' boot for nothin', sir."
The shoe was shined.
"Now, sir," added the boy, "I'll shine
the other boot for a penny, sir.' 1
The bagger boys with their plaintive
tales were describedâ father dead, mother
sick, etc.â and the Monsiprnor said more
likely the father was at tea and the mother
HUSTLING AND BUSTLING
.aXjILj the ti:m::e.
That's the way it is with us. People say things are dull
in San Francisco and merchants go around with gloomy
faces. Why is it ? What's the reason ? The harder the
times and the scarcer the money the more the effort should be.
We don't sit down on top of a case, bemoan the times and
wait for a stray customer. That's the old-time way of doing
things. We're up and "hustling," give bargains, show the
new fashionable things at prices that people can pay and
keep our departments "bustling" day in and day out. It
keeps everybody in good humor, both the customers and the
clerks, and that's what makes trading at our establishment
doubly pleasant. Price is the main incentive, though, and
we name them pretty low. Come and see what "THE NEW
MAZE" is. __^

drunk. "Don't be angry at him if he lies
to yon," pleaded the speaker. "He's no
body's child; what does he know; what
can he know?"
Thi9 led to a description of the young
girls, the ballad-singers of English citiei,
of whom a most pathetic picture was
drawn and the words burst from the
speaker:
Oh, !t is pitiful.
In a groat cityful,
Friend she had none.
Here the picture was realistic to a pain
ful degree, and the sadness of it all, as told
by the Monsignor, brought tears to many
an eye in the large audience.
In concluding, Mgr. Nugent pleaded
with his hearers to work for the waits
and outcasts of society, regardless of creed,
and in the interest of Humanity.
AN ANGEL ISLAND EPISODE.
The Sinnck Martie Wrecked on the
Shoalsâ Rescued by Soldiers.
An incident of interest almost amount
ing to a mild excitement varied the usual
uneventful quiet of the military post at
Angel Island yesterday afternoon.
A fishing smack hovered near the wharf
as though trying to make a landing. As
boats are not allowed to land without
permission, a corporal of the gaard went
down to warn it off. But though com
mands are potent on the shore tticy were
idle when directed to the wind, which was
blowing strong in shoie. While attempt
ing to jibe, the boat stranded upon the
beach, where the rapidly ebbing tide bade
fair to leave it.
The vessel was the Martie, manned by
one boy of about 15 years, and was bring
ing another boy to join some friends pic
nicking on the"island. The orlicer of the
day was notified, and after viewing the
wreck he sent for thirty or forty soldiers
and some ropes. Two old ropes were rim ;
brought, tied together and made fast to ';
the stern and then carried out en the I
wharf. Twenty brawny soldier boys ;
Leaved, the little rope gave way and ten !
brawny bluecoats measured their lengths. \
The b:g rope was then tried alone. Once'
more they heaved. "All ready ; together; |
heave!" C-c-crack. Another" break, buc !
this found the soldiers guarded. Then a j
brand new rope was made fast, this time ]
to the bow.
The water had now pone down so as
barely to lap the smack, and the keel was
well imbedded in the sana. But once
more, ail being ready, the Bignal was
given. The new rope held, and presently
the smacfc was in deep water. Once afloat
the momentum of the swell carried the
boat into the wharf, and everybody looked
to see the mainmast broken as the craft
shot under the landing. But willing
hands outstretched broke the shock, and,
with much advice, the sailor lad was sent
on his way rejoicing.

AS TO PROPERTY IN LAND
Verdict Against Private Owner
ship at the Y. M. C. A.
Debate.
LIVELY ECONOMIC DISCUSSION.
J. F. Leicester and A. H. Santorn
Take Opposite Sides on the
Question.
The Single Taxers, or at least the single
tax idea, gained a victory in the debate
last evening at the Young Men's Christian
Association, The subject was. "Is Prop
erty in Land Any More Justifiable Than
Property in Human Beings?" and the de
bate was held by and under the auspices
of the Y. M. C. A. Literary and Debating
Society.
There was a large and interested audi
ence present, the debate was spirited and
the verdict rendered by vote at the close
of the evening was against private prop
erty in land, at least in so far as the system
can be maintained in logic
The affirmative was maintained by J. F.
Leicester, the president of the society,
while the negative was championed by A.
H. San born. The contestants came pre
pared with all the weapons of polemical
warfareâ books, manuscripts and pencils â
and they were all brought into play.
Leicester said that after man's liberty
the right of possessing property is num
bered among his dearest prerogatives, and
that, while it was impossible for savages
ami is still impracticable for nomadic
tribes to enjoy this right, as soon as tribes
came together into communities they
found that their happiness depended
largely upon the degree of security which
they possessed of reaping the rewards of
their cultivation of the soil.
"Of course, it may be argued," said he
"that the right of holding lands keeps
others from enjoying the produce ;f that
land, but the same argument would al so
apply to personal property of all kinds.
If land-holding were as wrong as s'ave
holdin? its results would be is disastrous
Who will say they are?'
Sanborn, in reply, stated that the most
peculiar thing m connection with the
question at issue was that the proponents
of landholding never cared to araue the
question. 6
Taking up the arguments of Leicester he
said that in primitive times a man worked
by himselt and for himself, and that there
was no such thing as society or commu
'The very statement made by my op
ponent, said he, "that a man has a
nght to what he bus produced by his own
labor is a refutation of his own argument.
\N hat man can say 'I have produced a
single square foot of land by mv in
dustry? Every speck of land tha"t ex
ists to-day existed lons before my opDo
nent made his entry into this vale of
tear?.
"The argument that a man who culti
vates a rosebush and produces a beautiful
rose has a rigtu to the piece of land on
which it was produced for generations to
come is an argument that has tilled the
coders of the Rothschilds, the Goulds and
the Huntingtons. It is an argument that
has caused men to commit suicide for lack
of bread with which to soothe cue pangs ol

"We want freedom, but we don't want
the kind of freedom that was given the
man w bo was taken to the center of the
Atlantic ocean, dropped in and told he
had liberty to swim ashore. We are not
hunting for that kind of liberty." [Laugh
"And, now," said the speaker in conclu
sion, "let me state that there is no greater
crime a man can commit to-day than to
question the condition of the social fabric.
It was so in the case of Christ, of Luther
and of John Brown. Reformers to-day
need expect no other treatment. Truly, for
the 'New Man' there ia no God in Israel."
The affirmative then reviewed the an
swers of the negative, and said that as the
audience seemed to aeree with the nega
tive as regards slavery they might go to
Africa and sell themselves into bondage
for the fun of it.
A vote was then taken with the result
that a large majority supported the nega
tive. The question was then thrown open
to the house.
SIGHTED A WATERSPOUT.
Unusual Phenomenon Witnessed
by the Crew of the Chilean
Ship Republic
Passed in Close Proximity to a Whirl.
ing Cloud Extending From Sky
to Sea.
PORT TOWN SEND, Wash., April 11.-
Captain Lerish of the Chiiean ship Re
public, arriving this morning from Iquique,
brought into the branch Hydrographic
Office the first report ever made here of an
experience with a waterspout on the Pe.
cific Ocean. A waterspout was sighted by
the vessel at 11 :50 o'clock on the morning
of March 25 in latitude 35 dee. 30 mm. and
longitude 131 deg. 43 mm. The first indi
cation of the storm was a squall, which
struck the vessel suddenly and increased
in fury every moment. Soon afterward a
strange-looking cloud was noticed some
miles distant.
The men aboard the vessel kept a sharp
watch on the cloud, and they describe its
development as both grand and wonder
ful. First it was merely a tiny black
speck, which rapidly developed" into a
cone-shaped affair, with the vortex point
ing downward. The cloud seemed to
lower until it met the water and ther, as
suming the appearance of an hour-glass,
it whirled the water high into to* air, the
phenomenon being necompanied by a dull
rumbling sound similar to that of a pass
ing train.
When it dawned upon the captain and
crew that they were uncomfortably near a
waterspout, with the wind blowing in fitful
gOSts, they lost no time in crowding on all
sail and getting away from the dangerous
vicinity. Just how long the waterspo-it
lasted no one on board is prepared to aav
although th&t evenins, when the sun went
down, it was still plainly visible.
Shipmasters here say that waterspouts
in the vicinity mentioned are of very rare
occurrence.

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Last of the Oldtime United
States Revenue Cutter John
F. Hartley.
13 TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OLD.
Almost a Fatality Owing to a Donkey
En; in: Topp ing Off Lombard-
Street Wi.arf.
The revenue cutter Hartley will proba
biy never again do service in the bay for
trie Custom-house oinciab. She is now
laid up for repairs and the gasoline launch
Amy i* carrying the inspectors to the vari
ous foreign Incoming ships. The cylinder
heads of t c Hartley's engines are in such
condition that it is dangerous to run her.
The plans for these were burned up in the
Ris lon Iron Works fire, about live year 3
ago, and the only way of securing dupli
cates is by sending to Washington.
To do this would entail a long delay and
the subsequent work of repairing would
run into months. In the meantime the
new cutter, tne Golden Gate (a picture and
description of which have been published
The Old Revenue Cutter John F. Hartley That Has Seen Her Last Year of Sir vieÂ©. Ber Engines Can
not Be Repaired for a Long Time, and in a Couple of Months the New Golden Gate Will Be Ready.

in The Call), will be completed and ready
for service and then the Government will
have a launch for sale. The little cutter,
that has lived through seven administra
tions and earned the officers of as many
different Collectors of the Port, is now to
be placed in rotten row. She will be the
tirst revenue cutter on the Pacific Coast to
be placed on the retired list, and as such
she will go down in history.
The John F. Hartley was built in San
Francisco over twenty-live years ago and
has been in continuous service ever since.
During her life she has been almost re
built half a dozen times and this is the
last stiie. Had the drawing for the cylin
der heads not been burned up she might
have struggled along for a few motnhs,
but now her time has come, and if she is
seen on the bay again it will not be under
the revenue Mac.
The race between two crews of the South
End Itowing Club, stated to be postponed

The ferry steamer Oakland broke down
on her S:3O A. m. trip ye.-terday. One of
the shafts Droke. but the vessel managed
to reach her destination with only one
paddle-wheel. One trip from Oakland
was missed and the Piedmont brought
over adouble list of Dassengers on the 9:45
a. m. trip. Later the Newark took the
place of the Oakland and will continue run
ning until repairs have been made. The
supposition i.s that a pile pot into the
wlieelfand caused the breakdown.
The Pacific Maii Company's steamer
Acapulco arrived from Panama and way
ports yesterday with a full cargo and quite
a number of passengers. There was a rush
to land the cargo, and in the hurry the
men who had charge of the donkey-engine
forgot to Hcrew it down to the wharf. The
company's stevedore hn<l given official in
structions to pee that this work was at
tended to, and because of the failure to do
bo there was almost 8 disaster. Wnen the
pull came on the slinfr the donkey-engine
cave, and when the tide swung the steam
er's stern out over went the eneine, and
took Engineer Gus Franks and Longshore
man John Yietheer with it. The latter
was descending the gangplank when the
smokestack of the donkey struck him ana
cut i.is sCaln in three places. Franks
went to the bottom of the bay with the
engine, but on reaching the surface caught
hold of a rope nnd reached the deck. He
never .said a word to any one, but at once
went to Mission-street wharf to secure
another encine. In consequence the
rumor was prevalent for half an hour that
he was buried nnder the engine.
Among the passengers on the Acapulco
was A. F. Kye, late purser of the Mail
Company's steamer Aztep. All the Panama
Meamers have been short of coffee as
called for by tha manifest of late, and the
pursers and freight clerks are being called
upon to explain. There was a shortage
on the City of Sydney, and both the purser
and freight clerk were suspended. Both
have been exdneTated. The Aztec was six
sacks short on her last trip, and now Mr.
Nye has to explain.

REPORTS THAT DIFFERED
The Grand Jury Found One
Thing and a Market In
spector Another.
Ben Davis' Statements Contradicted
by C:mmi tecmea â Yay Bj
Invest : gated.
The recently rendered report of the hos-
I pital committee of the Grand Jury has not
I as yet been officially submitted to the
I Board of Health, and therefore no action
has been determined on by that body, but
some of the findings of the committee
\ have set the board to thinking, and it is
i not unlikely that an investigation may
i follow in the near future.
One of the thingi that strike the mem-
I bers of the board as peculiar is that the
I Grand Jury members reported that they
I had found the meat at the City and
\ County Hospital to be unlit for the use of
j the patients, while Chief Market In
i epector lien Davis, in his recently ren
; dered monthly statement, repoited that
| he had found all of the supplies of the hos
j pital to be in good condition.
While declining to express any judg
i ment on the matter p nding the official
I notice from the Grand Jury, it is evi
j dent that the members of the board are
somewhat worried at the discrepancy in
I the two reports, and that the subject will
! be given close scrutiny before it is allowed
| to drop.
Davis is supposed, in the course of his
, duty, to visit regularly all of the public
I institutions under the control of the Board
I of Health and to report on the condition
lof the food supplied to the inmates.
j Whether de failed to make his rounds as
| required by the department regulations or
j failed to report matters as We found tlieni,
or whether the three gentlemen who con
stitute the hospital committee of the Grand
i Jury were entirely mistaken in their esti
mate of the condition of the City and
Couny Hospital meat, must be decided by
! the board on the evidence it can get.
It is not long since Davis was under in
vestigation on charges of a serious nature
and came near losing his position, it was
alleged that he bad falsified his records in
order to cover an error or even worse
offense, and that he had been derelict in
his duty as Chief Inspector.
After the evidence was all in, Dr. Morse,
| one of the most conservative members of
I the board, declared himself to be decid
j edly of the belief that Davis was guilty
j and against retaining him longer in the
employ of the board. The other members
were inclined to take a more lenient view
j of the matter, however, and voted to re
l tain Davis. He was censured after being
warned to be more careful in the future,
and the matter dropped there.
Branching Out.
Will T. Valentine, the well-known all
round athlete, who for years has con
ducted a tailor-shop at 9 Powell street, has
removed to larger quarters at 510 Geary
street, near Taylor. Here he has branched
out with a complete merchant tailoring
establishment by putting in a full stock oi
the latest spring novelties. Mr. Valentine
is one of the young business men of this
City who may be contzratulated upon his
success, having begun in a small way a
few years ago an>J gradually built up a
lucrative patronage. The secret of his
success has been good workmanship and
strict attention to business. Mr. Valentine
is a popular member ot several organiza
tions, among them The Call Bicycle Club.

JORDAN ON THE CHARTER
The Stanford President Lectures
in Favor of Its Adop
tion.
CORRUPTION WELL SCORED.
He Recommends Some Changes in the
Present Form of Municipal
Government.
Professor David Storr Jordan, president
of the Stanford University, delivered a
very interesting and comprehensive lec
ture on the proposed new city charter last
night at Golden Gate Hall, under the
auspices of the Civic Federation.
"I am not much of a politician," said
Professor Jordan, "and I certainly am not
before you as a reformer. Nor is it my in
tent to stir up your consciences. Rather
would I do something to stir up the public
brain, f^ that it may understand the mat
ters of public interest which most nearly
affect us. We must in the first place real
ize that, while the National system of
government is based upon the successful
building up of a great people, the govern
ment of cities looks rather to tbe well
being of individual sections and members
of the body politic.
"The government of California is well
said to bo beneath the level of its people.
Particularly is this the case in the realm
of municipal government. Perhaps it
would be well for Americana to study the
manner in which nn English city is ruled.
I am an old Californian in the general
sense, having been here fully tive years;
but in England there is an element of
permanency which we lack in this country.
There we find successive Generations liv
ing in one city; here we move from city to
city. Henc â¢," in this country, a certain
apathy regarding governmental matters is
more or less noticeable.
"Th< right for liberty made by our fore
fathers involved a great principle, which
was that the governing power resided of
right in the people.
"The result of this principle v as that we
tried to weaken tyranny by weakening
government, to make officials harmless by
making them powerless. We succeeded
in displacing individual tyranny by or
ganized tyranny, official tyranny by non
tjfliciitl tyranny. The season is that our
dependence upon these large co-ordinating
functions inheres in the situation, not in
our constitutions. The relations are
there with all the subordination and all
the domination which they naturally in
volve. In failing to adequately recognize
them we have not suppressed them but
merely failed to provide for their legiti
mate exercise.
"The political evolution of the century
has taken a different direction in England
from that noted in tne United States.
Little effort has been made to weaken or
scatter administrative authority. The
idea! has been not limited authority, but
conditional authority. Immense power
lias been recognized as a condition of ef
ficiency. Complete and immediate re
sponsibility has been sought as a condi
tion of us safe exercise. An English
Prime Minister can do anything, always
with this reservation â that if he doesn't
do the right thing he may cease to be
Prime Minister, and that without notice.
There can be no possible doubt as to the
relative satiafactoriness of these two prin
ciples.
"The authority conferred must be com
mensurate with the service required.
There must be strict accountability lor its
proper exercise. To this end, the author
ity lor specific acts mn.it be attributable to
specific individuals. It follows that one
individual should be responsible for ;he
whole of one transaction. If liie responsi
bility for integral operations is divided be
tween several persons they may prevent
efficient action on the one hand, or, if they
agree on wrong action, they may avoid
personal responsibility.
"Modern municipalities are closely an
alogous to large business corporations.
Their functions are essentially industrial.
Their different Industrial interests are
separate on their technological side and
require specialist superintendents, hut
on their financial side they are pans of an
organic whole. It is as impossible to
separate them as it would be to entrust
different lines of expenditure in a family
to the Independent control of different
members. The management of the budgetâ
i. c., the co-ordination of different lines of
receipt and expend it ore â is essentially an
Indivisible function and should be trusted
loan undivided functionary. The manage
ment of great corporations is instructive
on th's point. The survival of the littest
has put beyond question that the financial
(not the technological) management of a
railroad company shall be a responsible
autocracy as the only possible provision
for efficiency and safety.
"The collective interests of the City
oujiht to be treated in the same manner as
tho<-e of a large corporation. Our law
makers are now looked upon more as
attorneys or agents t!ian as rulers. It
seems to me that this involves a tremen
dous responsibility on the part of there
lawmakers. They are supposed to be the
faithful exponents and executors of the
popular will, and are tound by a solemn.
implicit agreement to iullill this sacred
trust reposed in them by the confidence of
the people. But the American people are
sometimes a little superficial in" their
understanding oi popular questions. Tliev
often confuse things. But the mass of the
people have level heads and sound hearts.
As Lincoln said, you may fool Fome of
people all the time and all of the people
for a uart of the time, but you can t iool
all the people all the time.
"The army and navy may be called In &
certain sense un-American. In both these
important branches bf government abso
lute authority is the rule. Soldiers and
sailors cannot, form opposing parties, con
tending for the balance of power. Their
only duty is to obey. Hence the American
army a:id navy are a credit to the Repub
lic, though not so l?rge as those of some
o:h'T nations. A similar system of govern
ment oiurhl to rule in cities. Villages can
be ruled by the people, but large cities re
quire a governmental regime which will
force and oblige public servants to do their
duty. If we are to have a Mayor, let him
be something more than a tigure-head at
meetings and banquets.
"Let us hold him responsible for the
right exercise of tho ruling power which
the people confide in him. This man,
thus kept before the public eve, would be
better than the mysterious political bo*s.
Bosses are well enough, save when their
schemes are in danger. There may be
honor among thieves, but there is none
among rats striving to escape from a sink
ing ship, nor among politicians In danger
of losing their coveted spoils.
"In one word, the government of our
cities should be un-American. The Nation
may be governed by popular representation
but in tiie cities the ruling principle should
be submission to authority."
THIEVING NURSEGIRL.
Emma Ducoi Has Â£een Here Two
Months and Rubbed Two of Her
Employers.
Emma Ducos, 21 years of age, was booked
at the City Prison last night by Detectives
Egan and Siivey on a charge of grand lar
ceny.
Emma came here about two months ago
from Gftlveaton, TeXas, ana soon after
ward was engaged by Mrs. St. (jermaiti,
2006 Dcviyadero street, as nursegirl. She
was there a week and left takiug with her
a valuable silk waist and other articles l>e
lon^ing to Mr*. St. Germain and a hat
and underclothing belonging to the house
maid.
She procured a situation with Godfrey
Fisher, 821 O'Farrell street, and in ten
days disappeared, taking with her a dia
mond Fittg valued at $125, a lot of silk
handkerchiefs and other articles.
Her next and last aupearanc* was at
the residence of Mrs. M. Sullivan, 2701
California street, hut she had |not time to
make her usual haul.
The police had been notified of the thefts
and Egan and Silvey traced her to Mrs.
Sullivan's residence. They went there on
Friday afternoon and found in her room
most of the stolen articles and a pawn
ticket for the diamond ring, which she had
disposed of for $11. They at once placed
her under arrest.
FOR WOUNDED SOLDIERS.
A Benefit Being Planned in the Italian
Colony.
A dramatic performance is being planned
under the direction of Cay. Calegaris and
Mrs. Ghibandi for the benefit of the
wounded Italian soldiers in Africa
As soon as the news of the disaster in
Abyssinia was telegraphed I' ltalia opened
a subscription Hat for the benefit of the
wounded and the assistance of the widows
and families in Italy left suddenly des-i
--lute hv the massacres. La Voce del Popolo
and the Italian Consul also opened sub
scription lists.
It is to aid l'ltalia's fund that the dra
matic benefit is beinp planned. That
newspaper has already raised the sum oi
$1400 dollar by dollar and cent by cent.
Over a thousand dollars of the amount has
come from small country places in this
State and from workmen ana ranch Hands
in Oregon. Wa-hington, Nevada and Idaho.
Many of the letters which have accompa
nied the amounts have been from people
who could scarcely write, and some of the
bellicose remarks on tne subject of the
Abyssinians contained in the letters have
been quaint and totWMtfng.

Attorney Van Duzer Says the Claim Is
Hopeless and Advise? Against
Quitc'aim Deeds.
The Mission Defense Union, organized
primarily for the purpose of resisting the
claims of the Noe heirs, had a well-attend
ed meeting last evening at their hall, cor
ner of Twentieth and Guerrero streets.
John H. Grady presided, and A. P. Van
Duzer, attorney for the club, acted as sec
retary. It was announced that the club
now had a membership of 551.
Attorney Van Duzer reported that dur
ing the week he had tiled answers for
sixty-three defendants, making 203 mem
bers of the club who are now in court. Ho
stated that there were now about thirty
attorneys interested in the case, and some
of these put in dilatory motions which
were materially delaying tne suit. It hav
ing been reported that some of the de
fendants had purchased quitclaim deeds,
Mr. Van Duzer said: "If there is any
thing absolutely certain on the face of the
earth it is that this iraudulent claim will
be defeated." He strongly urged mem
bers of the club not to purchase these
deeds, as they were absolutely worthless
and could not possibly improve their
titles.
It was stated that some individual had
been fraudulently sellinu quitclaim deeds.
A motion was carried to have the execu
tive committee wait upon District Attor
ney Barnes and see if tnis p arty could be
prosecuted.
Upon motion of Charles Spader a com
mittee consisting of Judge Van Reynegom,
Captain Young, D. Kelly, H. ISolte and
Charles Spader was appointed by the
chair to confer with the club's attorney in
drawing up a bill to be presented to Con
gress, calculated to discourage such suits
as that which is now troubling the resi
dents of the Mission.
President Grady reported for the Mis
sion High School Club that they had
passed a resolution indorsing the prop
osition the club advocated, but this, he de
clared, was only a preliminary step. He
urged the necessity of the members agitat
ing the question of a Musion High School
at every opportunity.
The matter of securing the property
formerly known a3 the Home of Peace
Cemetery for a park was informally dis
cussed. Communications were read from
Hebrew congregation! interested in the
property, in which they promised to give
their earliest attention to the club's propo
sition to purchase the land. Judge Van
fieynegom suegesteri that perhaps some
of the wealthy Hebrews whose families
had for years used those grounds as a
cemetery would be interested in having
their memories perpetuated by naming the
proposed pork for them. Mr. Walton said
he had come in contact, with a number of
the Jewish people and they seemed in
clined to do all they could to help the park
project.
George Walton spoke enthusiastically in
favor of having Dolores street declared a
boulevard. He expressed the opinion that
a boulevard could be made of Dolores
street that would put Van Kess avenue to
shame.
At the conclusion of the meeting all
present signed a petition for a Mission
High School.

JUTE AT SAN QUENTIN
Warden Hale Has More Than
Four Million Grain Bags
on Hand.
FITZGERALD MADE PRESIDENT.
J. H. Wilkins, a San Rafael Lawyer
and Newspaper Man, Seated as a
Member of the Beard.
The Board of State Prison Directors met
in regular monthly session at San Quentin
yesterday. J. H. Wilkins of San Rafael,
the newly appointed member of the board,
took his seat after being introduced , by
Jacob Neff.
Director Fitzgerald was unanimously
chosen president of the board for the ensu-
ing year.
Professor Robinson of the Hamilton
Grammar School of this City presented a
petition in behalf of John McAdoo, who
was sent up in ISB9 for ten years for assault
to murder. Five years ago McAdoo "wan
dered away" from the prison and thereby
forfeited two years' credits. The petition
ers asked that these be restored, that Mc-
Adoo may bo soon released. Upon Profes
sor Robinson's promise to look after the
old tnan and be responsible for him the
petition was cranted.
Applications for pardons fnr Jose and
Francisco Alvigy were received and taken
under advisement. The two brothers were
sentenced to life imprisonment in 1879 for
tiie murder of Dutch John in Chular Can
yon, Monterey County.
The petition sets forth the fact that
Euladio Martinez, one of the chief wit
nesses ajrainst the brothers, died in prison
in 1887, and that on his death bed he con
fessed to Rev. William Hills of Berkeley,
then prison chaplain, that nis testimony
aeainst the brothers was perjured. At the
trial he had sworn that be rode by and
saw the brothers burning Dutch John's
body, and his testimony aided materially
in their conviction. H. V. Morehouse,
who was District Attorney of Monterey
County at the time, has written a letter
asKin:! that they be pardoned, as he be
lieves they have been punished enough by
sixteen years' imprisonment.
Ex-Prison Director J. J. Scrivener laid
before, the board a proposition to buy the
Gilrnan patents for bottle coverings made
of tviles.' He stated that, owing to the
reduction of the tariff, there was no proht
now in tiie manufacture. If the patents
were purchased it would give work for 200
prisoners, yet the product of their labor
would not come into competition with free
labor. The matter was referred to a com
mittee composed of Directors Wilkins, De
Pue and Htzseralci.
Warden Hale reported 337,000 grain bacs
sold and orders coming in rapidly. He
has 4,250,000 bags on hand .nn.l i 9 manufac
turing 15,000 a day. The Warden has re
ceived an Offer from Williams, Dimonti &
Co. for 25,000 sugar bags at J5 00 a hun
dred; also an offer of $5 a hundred for
10.000 ore bag-.
The board will meet at Folsom next
Saturday.

The members of the Mizpah Club and their
friends, to the number of probably 150, met

ASSESSOR SIEBE
TELLS HIS STORY.
Denies That the Taxroll Is
Several Millions
Short.
WORK NOT COMPLETE.
Defines the Law Governing the
Assessment of Foreign and
Home Bonds.
THINKS BURKE MEDDLESOME.
The Old Supplementary Taxroll of
Badlands Time Was Killed in
the Courts.
Assessor John D. Siebe is inclined to
treat lightly the statement that the tax
roll for the current year is several millions
Bhort of that of 1895. He claims that no
one, not excepting himself, can tell at this
time the status of the taxroll as compared
with that of other years, for the reason
that the work is not complete, nor will it
be for nearly sixty days yet.
The entire list must be gone carefully
over and such additions made as the re
forts of his experts seem to warrant. The
apparent depreciation in the valuation of
the gas and water company franchises is
explained by Mr. Siebe in his own pleas
ing way and on its face is thoroughly
plausible. The same is true of bants assess
ments. The Assessor tells why these in
stitutions are asked to pay taxes on
only $6,000, 000 worth of property,
vrhen the claim is made that the proper
valuation would be much nearer the $100, -
--000,000 mark. In thiÂ« connection John H.
Burke, prominent in Badlam's time, some
sixteen years ago, and who has recently
again interested himself in the affairs of
the Assessor's office, comes in for a rap.
"lam glad to see you; yes, very glad,"
said Assessor Siebe to a Cam, representa
tive yesterday. "I suppose you want to
know* something about the Tax Assessor's
om'ce, and how it is that the taxroll is so
many millions short. Well, it is just this
â way: There is not one word of truth in it.
Asa matter of fact the valuation is higher
this year than ever before.
"I notice that this man John H. Burke
has figuratively cast himself into the
breach and announces his purpose to see
to it that the banks and other corporations
are assessed for what they really have.
Reference is made to the supplementary
assessment of $!Â»0,0<i0,000, which this man
caused to be levied during Badlam's ad
ministration. At t .is time the valuation
of the gas company's franchise was in
creased from $1,u00,000 to $5,000,000. The
water company was subjected to the same
inflation.
'It may be interesting to know that the
tax on this $!)0, 000,000 supplementary as
sessment was never paid. The case was
carried to the Supreme Court, and then it

was defeated. The next year the assess
ment on the fianchises of the gas and
water companies dropped back to the old
figure. The valuation on the gas com
pany franchise is the same as it was six
teen years ago. The franchise is not any
more valuable to-day than it was then, and
my reason for saying this is capable of
easy understanding. There are two elec
tric light companies to-day, a fact which
of necessity has decreased the business of
the gas companies. The franchises of
these new institutions are assessed at
$300,000. Then ajrain there are many
hotels which formerly bought the gas con
sumed, but now resort to electric lights or
gas of their own production. It is safe to
assume, therefore, that the assessments on
the lighting franchises of San Francisco
have increased over half a million dollars
in the last ten years, though the gas com
pany is not valued at one cent more.
"Now, as regards bank assessments.
This office made the valuation on March 3,
and embraces only such property as the
Jaw declares is subject to taxation. I no
tice since this assessment was made that
the Bank Commissioners have called for a
statement from January Ito March 28. I
have my expert now examining these
statements, and the Assessor's valuation
will be based on thetii. It is absurd to
talk of the banks holding $108,000,000 tax
able property. They may hold securities
representing that amount, but it does not
follow by any means that it is all subject
to assessment as bank property. If this
were true, then the State and County
would collect a double tax. In commer
cial banks only bonds of corporations dom
iciled outside of California are subject to
assessments. Bonds of water, gas, rail
roads or other companies, with the parent
office in this State, are not subject to assess
ment.
"The reason for this is simple. Suppose
the Bank of California held bonds of a Los
Angeles corporation. I have no right to
assess them because the supposition is that
they have already undergone a similar
process in Los Angeles.
"I am not inclined to believe that the
Grand Jury has any fault to find with this
office. The investigating committee has,
of course, called here, but instead of con
demuing have praised the system em
ployed. There is always a remedy, how
ever, for the dissatisfied. If any one
thinks the assessment on any particular
piece of property or franchise is too low or
high the remeay is found in the County
Board of Equalization. They have the
power to undo all my work if it so pleases
them. Burke is a meddlesome fellow who
is probably endeavoring to secure the same
cheap notoriety he did during Badlam's
term of office. Further than this I have
nothing to say about him."
ASSESSMENT ROLL.
Property Hitherto Undervalued
May Be Assessed for Its
Actual Value.
Members of the Grand Jury are exceed
ingly reticent concerning the proposed in
vestigation of the Assessor's office. It is
acknowledged that Mr. Siebe, the Assessor,
has in the service of his department many
capable and experienced men, and it is
also hinted that "there are others." A con
sensus of interviews with jurors is to the
effect that the Assessor is performing his
duty and has invited the assistance of the
Grand Jury to point out methods by which
a fair valuatior ot all taxable property may
be reached.
The Grand Jury regrets that any news
paper comment about affairs of the As
sessor's ofhce should have been made.
One of the jurors said: "It is true that
we are in possession of certain data or in
formation regarding assessments, but the
fact still remains that a capitalist can, the
day before the Assessor comes to assess
his money on hand, put that money into
a draft on New York and thus escape taxa
tion. This is done right along, and there
seems to be no law to prevent it."
Another member of the Grand Jury ex
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 12, 1896.
pressed the opinion that the Assessor
would reach this year much property that
had hitherto escaped assessment, and
would place a fair valuation on much that
had been undervalued. This juror said:
"We have not ordered a special investiga
tion of the Assessor's methods of fixing
valuations, nor have we directed a special
investigation of his office. Assurances
have been received from Mr. Siebe that he
is desirous of conforming with the law in
every particular."
BURKE AFTER SIEBE.
The Claim Is Boldly Made That the
Tax Roll Is Millions
Short.
According to John H. Burke of Minne
apolis, but temporarily residing in this
City, there is a screw loose somewhere in
the Assessor's office.
On Friday last Mr. Bnrke appeared be
fore the Grand Jury and in fifteen minutes
told them enough to warrant a request
that tne gentleman from across the Rock
ies call some other day and linish his
story. Mr. Burke alleged in a general way
that the great corporations of San Fran
cisco were allowed to make just such re
turns to the Assessor as decency would ad
mit.
In those instances where Mr. Siebe was
called upon to place an assessment value
on franchises or property he did so with a
leniency most remarkable.
"I am glad to see the people waking up
to tho seriousness of the situation, " said
Mr. Burke last night. "The fact that I
am not now a citizen or taxpayer of San
Francisco should not weigh in the minds
of those who want to see fraud exposed.
It took me just two days to iind out that
there were millions of dollars' worth of
property not on the tax- roll, and yet other
millions assessed at practically nothing.
"For instance the Pacific Koliing-mills
made a sworn statement last year and
were assessed on $298,000 worth of prop
erty. The California Kailroad is not on
the books at ail. The same i 3 true of the
Northern Kailwav, though they have sev
eral hundred thousand dollars' worth of
! assessable property.
"Then there is the Pacific Improvement
I Company, builders and contractors of the
various lines of Paciiic roads and owning
many millions' worth of property, down
i for $12,000. Exclusive of steamers the
I Pacific Mail Steamship Company is as
â  sessed at $IM,S2<J. The South Paciiic
! Coast road makes a sworn statement of
! $100, while the Southern Development
Company, another 'octopus' concern, is
down for $30u.
"The Southern Pacific with many mill
ions of personal property labors under an
assessment of $45,300. The San Francisco
Gas Company is assessed on franchise
$1,000,000, and on other assessments $454,
--000. This, too, on a capital stock of
I $8,500,000 and heavy bonded indebtedness.
| In 18KL the franchise of this company was
| assessed by Badlam at $5000. 1 went to
i the Board of Supervisors and had it raised
i to $6,075,008.
"Since that time it has been gradually
j reduced until it now stands at the figure
j named. The franchise of the Spring
Valley Water Company is assessed at
I $1,500,000. other property $974,000. Yet
j this institution has a bonded indebtedness
I of $9,000,000 and was stated some time aco
Ito be worth $15,000,000. Badlam had this
j company assessed at $5000, which on com
j plaint, was raised to $5,000,000.
"in both these cases a content was made
I and finally carried to the Supreme Court,
j and the tax upheld. The Crocker Estate
j Company refused to make a sworn state
! ment, and was arbitrarily assessed at $150.
â¢ The California Sugar Refinery Company
I is down for $81,500, and the Union Iron
; Works for $107,000.
'â¢The assessments on the banks in this
I City are sway below all reason. I have
! all the figures, and when they are told to
j the Grand Jury I rather imagine some
i body will be greatly surprised."
STANFORD MEN'S VICTORY
Tennis Championship Wrested
From Berkeley After
Two Years.
A LONG CONTEST AND CLOSE.
Freeman and Picher Win From
R'agee and Gage in Singles
ani Doubles.
Stanford University won the Pacific-
Coast intercollegiate tennis championship
yesterday from the University of Cali
fornia, which had held it for the last two
years.
The match was played on the California
Tennis Club's court, corner of Bush and
Scott streets, in this City.
Each university was represented by only
two men, who were to play both the first
and the second class singles and the dou
bles.
California's representatives were Maeee
and Gage, the two men who successfully
defended the championship last year.
Stanford, for the first time, relied upon
two men to play both matches and entered
Freeman and Picher, Pasadena boys, who
have long played the game together, and
who are at present doubles champions of
Southern California, having won the title
at the Santa Monica tournament last sum
mer.
Freeman, Stanford's best player, was
pitted against Magee, the Berkeley cham
pion, and the contest that resulted, com
bining two very different styles of play,
was unusually 'close. Freeman winning
three sets to Magee's two, the scores of the
games composing the sets standing 3â6,
4-G, 6-4. 6-1, 7-5.
In the second-class singles Picher and
Gage were matched. Picher won three
sets to his opponent's one, tne score result
ing 7â5, 6â4, 4â6, 6â4.
At the conclusion of the singles in Stan
ford's favor the Berkeley team decided to
concede a victory in the'doubles, and that
match went to Stanford by default.
It was then 1 o'clock. The men had
been playing constantly for two and a half
hours, and Magee felt indisposed, although
the other players were comparatively fresh
alter their long exertions. Freeman and
Magee had played forty-six games; eigh
teen were long deuce contests and but four
were love, Freeman tuKing three of tnem.
Picher and Gage had played lorty-two
games, twelve deuce and nine love, Picher
having five of the nine to his credit.
Both single matches were played at the
same tiim* on adjoining court*.
The tirst few games between Freeman
and Magee seemed to go to the Berkeley
man, partly through the Stanford fresh
in 'Hi's apparent easy indifference in his re
turn strokes, but closer observation showed
that to be his way of playing, for Free
man, though only 17 years of a ire, is a big
muscular six-footer who easily covers a
large territory and lurches out over a good
deal more. Magee is the more brilliant
player and resorts to smashing strokes.
At the net hp seemed quicker. But Free
man took everything the sanie with a
silent coolness that seemed at times to ex
asperate his opponent and cause him to
smash wildly.
Picher and Gage play about the same
style of game. Both keep far back from
the net and neither does much smashing.
Gage was said to be not quite in his usual
form yesterday, but he played a cool,
steady game, Ins long, low drives at the
net beinc a feature as noticeable as Pich
er s fine backhand stroke.
The weather was warm and well suited
to tennis, but a high breeze that swept
over the fence bothered the players a little,
particularly those of the second team.
It was not generally known when and
where the match was to be played, and in
consequence very few spectators were pres
ent.
This makes the first intercollegiate
tennis match that Stanford has won since

W. Ahrens, Who Has Arrived From Samoa, and Says Germany Will Annex the

Will Be to Annex the
Islands.

No American Warship Kept at Apia
for Three Yearsâ The Berlin
Treaty Violated.
Among the arrivals at the Occidental
from Samoa is W. Ahrens, whose firm in
Apia are agents of the Oceanic Steamship
Company. He brings interesting and im
portant news from that part of the world.
"Chief Justice Ide." said Mr. Ahrens
last night, "has gone from Apia to meet
his daughter at Sydney. He will return
with them, and then bend all his energies
to completing his work on the land claims.
He hopes to have the work all done by
early in December, and will then sail for
his home in America to remain perma
nently. The Chief Justice has worked
very hard ever since he went over there.
"Another important piece of news is
that President Ernst Schmidt of Samoa,
who is also adviser to King Malietoa, has
forwarded his resignation to th 6 German
Foreign Otfice. He was appointed for
three years, and his term does not expire
till January 1, but he hopes to have the
resignation accepted so he can go back in
November. Of course England and Amer
ica will be requested to concur in the resig
nation. He has been criticized very
harshly, but 1 don't think he deserved it.
"The Samoans are very quiet, although
Tamassese, the opponent of King Mal
ietoa, collects the taxes in the districts of
Aana ana Atua. The President and ad
viser of Malietoa has not been able to pre
vent this.
"By the terms of the Berlin treaty
America, England and Germany agreed to
keep warships there ail the time, but
America has not had a warship there for
three years.
"No interest has been shown by America
in the islands during that time. The im
pression there is that America no longer
cares, as she did prior to three years ago.
This being the case, it is hard for President
Smith to niase Tamasse-se quit collecting
taxes. He can't do it. He does the best
he can.
"Yes, America has had the coaling sta
tion of Pango Pango, but I don't think she
will get it the way things now are. When
Germany annexes the islands, as I am sure
she will, she will take the whole thing.
"America has not compiled with the
terms of the treaty, and csn T say any
thing. What about England? Well, I
don't think she will have anything to Bay
about it either. The fact is the interests
there are pretty near all German, and Ger
many by right ought to have Samoa. I
think she will soon take the whole thing.
"The way England has acted recently in
the Jameson raid matter in South Africa,
and in its general opposition to President
Kruger, has widened the breach between
Germany and England. I don't think the
Germans would care what England might
say. She would take Samoa anyway.
"By the way, ' Dr. Rose, the new German
Consul-General for Samoa, has arrived at
Apia. He was previously Governor of
German New Guinea. He is the successor
of Dr. Schmidt-Leda, who has returned to
Yokohama as Consul-General, to look out
for the German interests there. He was
very much liked among all the people of
Samoa."
Mr. Ahrens expects to remain for two
years in this country. Before he went to
Samoa he was for several years in different
parts of New Guinea.

AND HIS SALARY RUNS BEHIND
The Annual Mectng at the Chuich
cf the Advent Produces Some
Mill Se:;sat.ons.
Oaklaxs OrriCE Bah Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, April 11. j
The members of the Episcopal Church
of the Advent were surprised by their
pastor, Key. Marshal Lane, at the annual
meeting this week, and they are still taJk
ing about it.
Only one part of the chnrch has "fully
measured" up to the expectations of the
pastor, and that is thp choir. He said that
the o!d parish sewing society, as an in
stitution of usefulness, bad outlived
its day. Sewing for charity or for
the love of providing for the church's
needs is all right, he said, but to
make things for sale is poor policy. It
ruins tne eyes, encourages idle talk, and is
always poorly and grudgingly paid. The
came time expended in visiting about the
parish and breaking down the charge of
a frigid unsociableness would do far more
for the church treasury, and leave a better
feeling all around.
Then came the great surprise. Rector
Lane said that there was altogether too
much indifference among the various so
cieties in tne church. He said the building
was the dirt iest church he was ever in. He
complained of his salary, and said that in-
Btead of receiving $2500, as he should, he
only got (1200, and frequently had to wait
so long for his month's pay that he envied
the man who passed his door with a tin
dinner-pail in his hand knowing that
when his wages were due he would walk
up to the cashier and tret his money. The
carpet on the church floor was also de
nounced, the rector saying that it was lit
for but one purpose â it'should be sent to Ja
pan to wipe out the black plagae with.
Rev. Mr. Lane urged the various socie
ties to choose their officers solely on the
ground of merit and sympathy for their
work. With good, clean accommodations
for the young people and some interest
among the parents for the welfare of their i
own children there is a good future for the j
parish, but old ideas and Silurian methods
must be wiped out rirst.
A. J. Rpad, the treasurer, reported
that special efforts had always been made
to pay th'- rector promptly and he thought j
the church had done very well, yotwith-
Etanding the hard times, the receipts
of the parish bad been about one
fourth greater than for many
years. A year ago the floating in
debtedness was about $700, and ail that
had been cleared off and the running ex
penses paid. There are now 240 commu
nicants as against 114 reported by the last
rector about eighteen months ago.
BOOTH WANTS DAMAGES.
Sues the Klectric Kuad Company for
Killing Hia Children.
OAKLAND, Cat,., April 11.â Suit was
filed in the Superior Court to-day by Attor
ney Sam Bell McX c on behalf of Frank
E. Booth against the Oakland Consolidated
Ftreet Railroad for $50,22U SO aamaees.
Mr. Booth is the father of little Kate
Anna Booth and Idah Emilie Booth, the
two children crushed to death by an elec
tric-car of that line one evening wliile
playin? in the street.
The complaint alleges that at the time
the cars of the defendant were so carelessly
and negligently run a:. I managed that tne
children, who were pmdentiy and care
fully travel :ng on a crossing, could not see
or hear a car of defendant approaching
from the east and i:oing westerly, and also
that the .-aid car had at mat time a
wheeiguar.l negligently and carelessly
constructed, which was who ly insufficient
to protect from injury Â«if struck by said
car.
It is farther avprred that the oar was
run at a great, careless and negligent rate
of speed of ten miles per hour, and with
out ringing a bell or giving any warning
of Ita approach, and the death of the
plaintiff's children was due to the neg
ligence and carelessness of the defendant,
ore stated. The plaintiff alleges
that by the death of the said children he
- iffered darna-res in the sum of
150,000 and was put to an expense of $220 SO
in the burial of the little ones.
The railroad company will in all prob
ability contest tne case on the ground oi
contributary negligence in allowing the
children, aged 9 and 5 years, to co upon
the street unattended. It was shown at
t he inquest that they had been playing
tat: and the older one whs running away
from the younger when, in passing behind
one car they fell in front of the other,
which resulted in their death.

A new feature to attract attention to the

A PRACTICAL. JOKER.
Charles Merrill Held for Trial on tlie
Charge of Robbery.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 11. âCharles
Merrill was held toanswerin the Superior
Court with bonds nxed at $20(J0 to-day as |
the result of a practical joke played I
nearly two years ago. In all proba
bility he would have been discharged had
he faced the music at the time and told his
story, but instead he fled and was not ap
prehended by the police until this week.
The evidence shows that on the evening
of June 19, 1894, Merrill and two compan
ions were returning from the theater,
walking down Eighth street, when they
saw a Chinaman. Merrill suggested that
they frighten him and one of his compan
ions, Guy Chapman, consented.
They walked up and asked the Mongo
lian for 10 cents, which he denied having
and to prove it allowed his purse. Merrill j
grabbed the purse and ran.
The Chinaman believed he was in the
hands of real highwaymen and called for
help. Chapman, however, did not run,
and when i;n oftie-r arrived he was ar
rested, but wss dismissed on his prelimi
nary examination. Merrill was not caught,
bat the next morning when be learned of
his companion's arrest became alarmed
and left town. The court thought his leav
ing was against bin, alt ough both com
panions tfstiiied it was only a prank played
in fun.

Supervisors Force Them to Accept a
Saloon in Spite of Their Unani

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, April 11. j
The wives and mothers of San Lorenzo
have organized a woman's suffrage club
and intend to work with great vigor for
the privilege of voting. They are highly
indignant because the Supervisors have
forced them to have a saloon and beer
garden in their midst against tiieir deli
nitely expre-sed wishes.
For many months the residents of San
Lorenzo have endeavored to prevent the
selling of liquor in the grove, but now
that tney have been defeated they will
change their tactics. The ladies realize
that they have no rights that the Super
visors are bound to respect, and declare
that they will be treated differently when
they have the right to vote.
fcan Lorenzo Grove is a resort owned by
the Haywards Electric Railroad Company.
It is used by picnic parties, especially on
Sundays, and^ast year it was, on several
occasions, the scene of small riots which
were a nuisance to the residents of the
town and which made necessary the serv
ices of extra police.
Three times the application fora license
was defeated by Rev. J. C. McCollum and
the Christian Kndeavorers, but at this last
meeting the Supervisors granted the license
to Fred Borman, who has leased the place.
The petition which was presented to the
Supervisors stated that "we, the women of
San Lorenzo, the wives, mothers, teachers
and orders â those most notably anddeepK
concerned in the moral and spiritual
welfare of the children and yomie people
of the community, appeal to you and most
earnestly entreat that you do not grant
such license." The signatures of nearly
all the wives and mothers of San Lorenzo
were attached, but the petition was un
heeded.
Fred Borman Bays he has been mis
understood. "The battle has been a hard
one, but I em not particularly rejoioed
over my victory, except in so far as it wili
enable me to do business, in preparation
for which I have already spent consider
able money. I feel, however, that I have
been quite generally misunderstood in the
matter. The grove was, last year, con
ducted by a man of my name, who ap
peared to be unable to maintain order,
being overawed by disreputable characters,
allowing the place to become an intoler
able nuisance to those residing in that
vicinity. This has reflected upon me, as
many persons believe that I am the same
man. It is my purpose to conduct the
place within the limits of the strictest
order and decency, and my past experience
in conducting public gardens proves that
it can be done."
The opposition to the establishment of a
large athletic park at ILiywaras is based
on the idea that a liquor license would be
granted and the r/iace be another Sunday
resort.

BANKEK LITTLE'S CHANCE.
Judge "Wood May Be Compelled to
Release the Swindler.
OAKLAND, CaiÂ«, April 11. â Judge
Wood of the Police Court refused to an
nounce his decision in the matter of hold
ing Root, alias Kayniond, -alias Miller,
alias Morton, alias Wood, alias Nes bit,
charged with complicity in the gold-brick,
swindle, to-day, so that if possible Banker
Little of Dixoo could be prevailed upon to
swear to a warrant. It now all depends
on the banker's action whether a man
already proven an exceedingly dangerous
character to be at large shall go free.
When the case came up to-day Judge
Wood said he had no doubt at all that
Root was guilty, but he did not think that
under the law he could hold him on the
charge, but would refuse to pass on the
subject until Monday.
CHOP PROSPECTS.
Grain Is Very Cleau and Fruit Is in
First-Class Condition.
HAYWARDS, Cal., April 11. _ The
favorable spring weather and the recent
warm showers have been of much benefit
to growing grain, and there is every indi
cation that farmers will harvest one of the
largest yields to the acre they have had
for years past and of excellent quality.
The grain as it now stands is very ciean.
The rains have not been heavy enough to
start the fine grass.
The fruit outlook at this time indicates
a fair yield of cherries and apricots, and in
many instances a light crop throughout
the valley; a fair crop means a better
quality and prices are usually in favor of
the seller. Other fruits seem to show about
an average yield, but none of the orchard
ists report anything above a fair crop of
any variety.

OFFICERS BADLY BUNKOED
A Chinaman Tricks a Pound
master, Who in Turn Fools
a Deputy.
AH SAM MAKES A TEN STRIKE.
He Escapes in the Darkness and Pilot
Crowley Is Still Looking for His
Day's Fees.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 11. f
All the towns between here and Hay
wards are enjoying the story of a dilemma
that befell Poundmaster Crowley of Hay
wards a couple of days ago.
One of the smartest of San Francisco
Chinamen came over to Alameda County
this week to do business. Being a mer
chant representing several large houses he
cast his eye around looking for a suitable
official to introduce him to the leading
business men of the county and to prompt
him generally in his rounds.
The Chinese merchant, whose name was
given as Ah Sam, finally came across
Poundmaster Crowley. As the ordinance
regarding stray dogs and horses has been
strictly enforced for some months the
Poundmaster was only too glad to do any
thing that would add to his income, and
he accepted the Chinaman's offer to show
him around. They engaged a buggy and
whenever the poundtuan pointed out a
merchant of standing Ah cSam would go
in and Crowley sat outside. The China
man seemed highly please) with his suc
cess and iÂ±id a big business at Mount n,den,
and then a visit was made to San Lorenzo,
where several more orders for goods were
secured.
Meantime Captain Hansen, a deputy
Constable, heard that the lottery ticket
business was being boomed in this'county
and he started out to make a capture if
possible. He soon located the merchant
with whom Haywartis' dignified pound
rr.aster was riding. Captain Hansen ques
tioned them, and as Crowley gave
a full explanation of their business
they were permitted to go. Hansen
continued his search and soon again
ran across the same couple. He waited
till Ah Sam left a store and then went
In and made inquiries which proved thai
the Chinaman was selling and taking or
ders for lottery tickets.
Captain Hanson arrester! Ah Sam and
also Crowley as an accomplice. The
Poundmaster showed his badge of oftice
and made known his position to the Con
stable, but it all availed nothing and Cap
tain Hansen started for Haywards with
his prisoners.
As the b-jggy was only built for two the
Constable led the horse and the prisoners
occupied seats. Before reaching the cala
boose darkness came on, and as It cam^
the Chinaman went, and he has not since
been seen. Tne deputy proceeded with
the Poundmaster under arrest, but after a
parley he was convinced that he had no
evidence asrainst his prisoner and was
forced to release him.
There is much speculation now as to
who was most badly duped. Captain Han
sen certainly caught a tartar in Crowloy.
Crowley is not yet paid for acting pilot
and the use of his rig, and the Chinaman
is doubtless in Sun Francisco, and has
struck San Lorenzo from his visiting list.

EFFECTS OF THE STRIKE
Prominent Contractors Indorse
the Building Trades Work
ing Card.
ARE SIGNING AN AGREEMENT.
The Present Situation Results From a
Conference Held a Year
Ago.
From all that can be learned the unions
connected with the building trades are
entering upon an era of prosperity never
before equaled in the history of trades
on onism In this City. This prediction is
based upon important information re
ceived at the headquarters on Turk street
early last evening, which kept the men in
earnest discussion until a late hour. The
news was nothing else than that a large
number of the reputable and prominent
contractors, members of tbe Builders' Ex
change, are banding themselves together
to help the unions of the building trades
in enforcing the working-card.
The history of this action dates back to
a year ago this month, wi.en the trades
unions were not as prosperous as they are
now. The carpenters sent representatives
to the members of the Builders' Exchange
and asked them to enter into a compact
similar to the one in vogue in Chicago,
commonly known as the "Chicago agree
ment." This arrangement has been very
successfully carried out between the Chi
cago contractors and the building trades
unions for several years.
Under its provisions the contractors
acree to assist the members of the
unions to observe the union rules relative
to the hours of work, rate of wages and
the employment of only union men. The
latter in return protect the contractors by
driving out of business all "coyote" con
tractors who work as journeymen part of
the time and do contracting at other times
at rates below what any reputable con
tractor can fitrure.
Such an agreement the local carpenters
wanted to make with the contractors, but
the latter said that the unions v>ere not
properly organized at the time. "Go and
perfect your organizations; get all your
craftsmen into your unions and then you
will be in a position to demand better
wages, better hours and a recognition of
the working card," was the substance of
the answer in reply to the request.
The workmen at once took the hint be
lieving that when they could make a
showing their request would be favorably
received by the better class of contractors.
In furtherance of the idea the Building
NEW TO-DAY.
DR. EDISON'S PILLS AND SALT
Have Been Triumphantly Tested by the Ameri-
can Medical Agre.
Mrs. Catharine Hammond Hitrney, San Francisco, Keduced 36 Founds.
From tbe American Medical Age.
"A system of co r respondence which has !
been carried on between the editors of this j
publication and a few of the people who j
have been benefited by Dr. Edison's !
Obesity Pills and Salt has developed the j
faci that oat of 30D consecutive cases the
average reduction in 150 cast 3 was 28 pounds
per month, and in 156 cases was 19J.Â£
pounds per month. In one of three un-
successful cases, so called, the total re-
duction was 26 pounds, in the second 23
and in the third 15. The use of these
remedies was followed by no disagreeable
results, and was in every wav beneficial."
The iat man's tenure of life is very uncer-
tain in dos' days. So is the fat woman's.
Take Dr. Edison's Obesity Pills and Salt
and wear his Obesity Band. If you are
not so very fat a month's treatment ought
to reduce you satisfactorily. If you weigh
a good many more pounds than you ought,
two months' treatment ought to do it.
Hundreds of others all around you are
getting in shape to bid defiance to hot
weather. Why don't you do it, too, when
it is so easy?
Writing from her home on Argentine
avenue, Mrs. Catherine Hammond Har-
ney, whose portrait is above, says: "I
grew fleshy until I advanced from 129 to
196. I was afflicted abo with heart and
liver trouble. I took three bottles of Dr.
Edison's Obesity Pills and two of his Fruit
Salt, and they reduced me thirty-six
pounds and ouite cured me of my heart
and liver disease. I t:;en took these reme-
dies more sparingly another month and
was permanently reduced to my old
weight."
Mrs. Lena Langdon Haven, Ninth ave-
nue, writes: "I was so fat last summer
that I suffered awfully. I was not only
fat, but sick. Early in February I began
taking Dr. Edison's Obesity Pills iand Salt,
and in six weeks tney reduced me to my
old weight (125), relieving me of thirty-
five pounds of surplus fat, restoring my
oid graceful form and curing me of indi-
gestion and palpitation of the heart. Ido
not dread hot weath r now."
Mrs. Susette Hampton Pixley, Dolores
street, writes: "For too plump shoulders,
arms, Dust and neck I took Dr. Edison's
Obesity Pilis ana Salts, and in six weeks
was brought to symmetry and comeliness.
These reme-Jies restored all of my old charm
of figure and improved my health."
Take these remedies in spring to fortify
your system acainst the dangers of the
summer. Dr. Edison's Pills aii'd Salt re-
duce fat and cure chronic diseases. Write

DEPARTMENT for iree advice about,

Trades Council was organized ard as it i 3
well known the working card was put out
on the Ist inst. . "
The strike tbat followed did not have
an injurious effect upon the arrangement
because those affected by the strike are not
in the list of those who" advised the jour
neymen to organize a year ago and it
served one good purpose. It showed the
strength of tne building trades unions. This
was what the local contractors mentioned'
wanted to see. and having seen it is evi
dent that they are satisfied.
Yesterday a prominent contractor In
conversation with one of his workmen gave
the startling but pleasing information that
a number of the most reputable and best
known contractors in the Builders' Ex
change were signing an agreement to
stand by and support the card system. He
atided: "I signed the agreement to-day,
and there is a long list ahead of ray name.
If the unions stand by the card we will
stand by the unions." The contractor made
good his words by informing the men that
they must all show up for worK on Mon
day morning with their working cards in
hand.
When comparing notes at headquarters
last evening it was found that several con
tractors had notified their men to be pro
vided with working cards on Monday
morning, and two of the contractors gave
similar information regarding the agree*
ment among the contractors to uphold the
unions' workin.r card system and employ
only union men. This agreement so far
as can be learned exists only among mem
bers of the exchange and completely cuts
off outside contractors.
SUICIDE WITH A BIFLE.
C. 11. Warden hnU the Fatal Trigger
With Hh Toe.
C. H. Warden committed suicide last
night at his home, 621 Twenty -first street.
He loaded his Winchester riCe, removed
the shoe from his right foot, placed the
muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and
pulled the trigger with his toe. There
was a loud report, and when members of
Warden's family rushed into the room
they found him with the top of his bead
blown off. He died instantly.
Warden was 28 yean of age. He leaves
his mother and tur^e sisters. The mother
said he bad been out of work for a long
time, and was expecting money that did
not come. Though of a jolly disposition
he grew despondent.

do it you will ever afterward wonder why
you di<> not do it sooner. You remember

fer in hot weather. You were in danger of
sudden death almost every day from June
to September. You knew it then and
you know it now. Why don't you get
over on the safe side? Dr. Edison's Pills
and salt are the greatest spring medi-
cines. They go farther and cost less and
do more good than any others.

AN HONEST OOAL-DEALEB.
He Surprise* His Heavy Driver by Eas-
ing His Own Conscience.
Mr. Black, the eminent and wealthy
coal-dealer, called one of his oldest drivers
into the office the other morning and ten-
dered him quite a large sum of money,
according to London Tid-Bits.
"What is this for?" asked the astonished
driver.
"Merely a token of appreciation for
services rendered," replied Mr. Black
kindly.
"But you've always paid me well for my
services, and that was appreciation
enough."
"There is really more than that in it,"
John," continued Mr. Black. "I really
owe you the money."
"I don't understand."
"Let me tell you," and he dropped his
voice to a whisper. "You have been with
me for twenty years, working 300 days
every year, and averaging three loads a
day; that makes 18.000 loaits. You wei^h
150 pounds, John, and we have never failed
to weijrh you with every load; that makes
2,7oo,ooo pounds, or 1200 tons. This at an
average of Â£1 per ton, John, represents
Â£1200. The package you hold in your
hand contains Â£120, or 10 per cent, which
we think is yours by right. We are honest
men, John, and don't desire to defraud
anybody of what is justly his."
John bowed in humble submission and
is now waiting for the next dividend.

FEUNER WON A TROPHY
The Eeautiful Fay Diamond
Medal Passes Into An
other's Hands.
Second Day's Shoot of the California
Â£tate Sportsmen's Annual
Tournament.
The second day's trap-shooting of the
California State's Sportsmen's Associa
tion's fourteenth annual tournament was
heM yesterday at the Oakland Trotting
Park. The attendance was not as large as
on xhe preceding day, but the sport was
e;ood. A strong west wind blew across the
traps, and whenever the birds rose in
earnest they lost no time in taking the
wind and flying for safety like rockets.
However, very few made their escape,
and many pretty stops were effected when
the pigeons were near the limits. Not a
few dropped dead after crossing the line
owing to the force of the wind. Those
that got away from the trap-shooter& flew
into a perfect battery of guns outside of
the fence. Much interest was centered
upon the beautiful diamond medal pre
sented years ago by Ned Fay. Only seven
events marked the day's sport.
The first was a six-bird match, $2 50 en
try. The purse was divided into three
prizes of $12 50, $7 50 and $5. The score
stood :
Robinson 6, Feudner 5, Courtney 6. Funning
6, Slade 6, Steiling 6, MoMurcliy (j, Sedam 5,
Haight 4, \Vehb4.
As seen six of the shooters killed all of
their birds, so the tie was uhot off in the
second event, which resulted in another
tie among Robinson, blade and Stelling,
who divided tne entire purse of the first
event.
The second event was a ton-bird match
for a purse of $40. Robinson, Feudner and
Steiling divided the purse. The scores
made stood: , :
Robinson 10; Femlner 10; StelHng 10;
Webb U, w; Fupning 1, w; McMurcby 9;
Haight 2, w; Courtney 6, w; Sedam 9.
Event No. 3 was another 10-bird match,
$5 entry. The entries and scores stood as
follows: ': .',
McMurchylO; Sedam G; Fanning 10; Feud
ner Robinson ti, w; tHuihuglO; Haight7;
Courmey 1, w; Web.b 10. . ;
As seen there were four ties on 10 birds,
and the money was divided among those
who made clean scores.
The next was the contest for the Fay
diamond medal and the entrance money
that went with the match. The medal
has been the property, temporarily, of
nearly all the best shots on the coast. Last
year it was held by Crittenden Robinson,
who came within the line of possibility of
wearing it for another year. He waa
pressed too close by Otto Feudner, who
made 25 straight kills to Roblnson'a 24.
Robinson's score, however, cave him the
purse, according to therterms of the pre
sentation. Tha conditions were $5 en
trance, 20 birds and the use of both bar
rels. Following shows the entries, scores
and when the second barrel was used.

birds. Sedam killed eeven and McMurchy

Five of tne sportsmen withdrew before the
event was over, leaving to finish the score
McMurchy 10, Sedam 9, Webb 9, Haijrht

purse.
The seventh was similar to the other
matches, with $30 in the pool, which was
divided by Robinson and Webb, each male
ing ten straight kills. Seaam and Mc-
Murchy made nine each and the others
withdrew.

HUNTINGTON TO

AWAITING FORECLOSURE
All His Arrangements Said to
Be Made for Purchasing the
Insolvent Road.

C. P. Huntington is said to have his

31ap Showing Some of the Links of the Additional Through Line Said to Be in Contemplation by
C P. Huntington.
nus with the Atlantic and Pacific and a
branch of the >~t. Louis and San Francisco
roads as link?.
When C. W. Smith was appointed re
reiver of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad
he was credited with having secured that
desirable position through the influence of
C P. Huntingdon, who is credited with
holding a majority of the bonds of the At
lantic and Pacific. Since his appointment
Receiver Smith, who had always been
known as a strong Santa Fe man, has vir
tually severed the close relations that had
previously existed letween the Atlantic
and Pacific and the Santa Fe in his en
deavor to secure a more advantageous
traffic arrangement for the road he repre
sents. The significance of this to railroad
men is that he is evidently strongly an
tagonistic to the r<">al of which he was
formerly first vice-president.
His present attitude is attributed to his
not being elected president under there
cent reorganization scheme, an c ffice which
he nad confidently hoped to attain. It was
given instead to Julius Kheinhart, who
was formerly auditor, but who has since
been superseded owing to alleged misman
agement. As a result of this course of the
new Santa Fe directorate Mr. Smith is now
reported to be bending all his influence to
further the interest* of the presidem of the
Southern Pacitic Company.
The Atlantic and Pacific is to be sold
under foreclosure in a few months and
Huntington, it is reported, is fully pre
pared to attend the sale and buy in the
property. His purpose is to then extend
the road to a junction with Sapulpa, Indian
Territory, the western terminus of the St.
Lous and San Francisco road, which had
originally been projected to run to Cali
fornia.
It is claimed by those who are familiar
with the situation that Huntington is in
the best position to secure control of the
Atlaaitic and Pacific. The Atlantic and
Pacific proper extends from The Needles to
Albuquerque, a distance of 578 miles,
â while the section from Mojave to The
Needles, a distance of 241 miles, though
popularly supposed to be the property of
the Atlantic and Pacific, is in reality
owned by the Southern Pacitic and leased
to the Atlantic and facitic with the privi
lege to purchase under certaia conditions.
This would therefore leave only 578 miles
to be purchased. Huntington would
have to purchase in addition the 241 miles
between The Needles and Mojave. An
other point in Huntington's favor is the
possession of the majority of the bonds of
the Atlantic and Pacific.
It was tde original intention of the
Bt. Louis and San Francisco people to
build to a connection with the Atlantic p.nd
Pacific, and the line was extended west
ward from St. Louis to Sapulpa, in Indian
Territory. This idea was abandoned,
however, when the Santa Fe entered into
a combination with the Bt. Louis and
San Francisco whereby both roads jointly
constructed the Atlantic and Pacific. The
Bt. Louis and San Francisco is now said to
be heartily tired of the regime of the Santa
Fe so far as the Atlantic and Pacific is
concerned and to be willing to make a
satisfactory arrangement for the use of its
line from Sapulpa to St. Louis by an inde
pendent line that would build from Albu
querque to a connection with Sapulpa.
The gap to be thus closed is about 600
miles and is through New Mexico, Texas,
Oklahoma and Indian Territory, a section
that is said by railroad men to be most
promising for railroad exploitation.

the amateur champion, and R. Linehan to
play T. F. Bonnet ar.d J. Feeney.
The long-deferred match between T. J.
Bonnet and J. C. Nealon and R. Lenihan
and J. J. Feeney, the crackerjacks of the
Union court, will take place in that court
this afternoon, weather permitting. It
will be one of the tinest games ever seen
in this City, as they are all expert players.
Lenihan and Feeney will have the ad
vantage of being familiar with the court,
and their friends are sanguine that they
will win.
The greatest interest is being taken in
the coming match between Bonnet and J.
Harlow, the coast champion, to be played
in the San Francisco court Sunday week.
The match will be for a $50 trophy, to be
presented to the winner by Phil Ryan, the
proprietor of the court. Agooddeal of
money has already been wagered on the
result, each having numerous backers.
STREET PAVEMENTS.
A Kew Kind That Is Meeting With
Marked Approval.
The problem of street paving is one that
every city, both great and small, through
out the civilized world has wrestled with
at one time or another. It is a question
that concerns San Francisco deeply at this
time, for this City has some of the worst
paved streets in the country and none that
are entirely satisfactory. This important
subject has recently received much atten
tion from the State Board of Harbor
Commissioners and with apparently satis
factory results.
About two years since they allowed the
Williams Asphaltum Block Paving Com
pany to lay a sample of their work on the
seawall in front of pier No. 6, Howard
street, which proved so satisfactory that
the board lias since ordered eeveral pieces
laid at other points on the seawall, and
recently at the entrance to the ferry land
ing at the foot of Market street, as a sub
stitute for the bituminous rock, which had
failed to give satisfaction. The AYilliarns
Company in that instance furnished a
satisfactory guarantee that their work
should be kept in good condition for a
term of five' years, despite the immense
amount of heavy teaming destined io pass
over it.
The new Pacific-street wharf, 50x000 feet,
which is vastly superior to any other
wharf structure ever erected on the water
front, has just been paved by the Williams
Block Company under a guarantee to be
kept in repair for the term of live years
free of charge to the State. Such evidences
of merit have induced several of the City
officials to thoroughly examine this style
of pavement.
The great claim advanced by the Wil
liams Block Company is that they possess
skill in the manipulation of their aspnal
tura, which enables them to produce re
suits as much superior to the old style of
work as steel is better than the iron* from
which it is produced. The surface-cover
ing for their pavement is almost like sheet
lead. It dints Elightly, but does not
abrase, and in that consists ita superiority
and great wearing qualities.
Young Men's Christian Anaociation.
Next Tuesday evening there will be a bicycle
exhibit in the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion buildinsr, Mason and Ellis streets.
Twenty-five or thirty different bicycle agen
cies will display their wheels, the exhibit to
continue for three days. Exhibition free to
the public, and it will probably be one of the
most attractive exhibits in San Francisco. It
will comprise ladies' and centlenien's wheels
end tandems. The attendants will appear in
riding costume.
The directors and trustees of the association
will hold their regular meeting to-morrow
(Monday) evening at H o'clock in the directors'
room, association building. The total amount
of the subscriptions has now reached $90,500,
and it is very probable the entire sum of
$100,000 will be reached before the end of this
week. The meeting to-night will be large and
enthusiastic, as the splendid success attend
ing the efforts of the boards of management is
exceedingly encouraging.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 12. 1896.
GUTIERREZ HEMMED
IN AT HIS HOME
Four Sentinels on Guard
at His Door to Pro
tect Him.
PEOPLE IN SEMI-REVOLT
Dr. Pena and Dr. Keith Say
Either Ezeta or Alfaro Will
Be President.
THE YELLOW FEVER IS RAGING
The Deaths So Far, They Say, Are
About 90 Per Cent of Those Who
Are Attacked.
Dr. J. M. Pena and Dr. B. Keith of Sal
vador, who arrived here yesterday on the
Acapulco, report that that country is on
the eve of a revolution. It is like a vol-
cano that is liable to break out at any mo
ment.
The whole country is armed. There are
so many sentries on duty that a man is
not safe to venture forth at night.
Dr. Per.a, who lives at Sonsonate, did it
one evening before he left. The wind was
blowing and he did not hear the shout of
the guards. The next moment a ritie bail
whizzed past him.
The country is so perturbed, so the two
medical gentlemen say, that no doctor will
venture out after 7 o'clock at night. This,
too, at a time when yellow fever is raging,
and when 90 per cent of those attacked are
dying.
The people want a new President, so the
two physicians assert.
"They are very tired of Gutierrez," said
Dr. Pena. "He has not fulfilled his prom
ises. Gutierrez is in such danger tiiat lie
does not dare venture out of his house day
or night.
"Four sentries are standing Â»nd keeping
guard at his door. His own army is ready
to desert and to take up arms against him.
"If General Ezeta, who is lying by at
Panama, was only in the country he would
be President in fifteen minutes. The only
difficulty is that he can't get up there. If
he was he would have the army and every
thing at bis disposal.
"Editor Ezeta or Alfaro will be the next
President. Gutierrez will have to go.
Alfaro is now V ice-President. He has
gone over into Nicara.ua to adjust the
boundary difficulty between the two coun
tries. Alfaro would like to be President.
"Otto Muchmuier, the United States
Consul, who rame there some time since
from Pennsylvania, has lost his wife,
sister-in-law and all hi 3 children. He got
changed from the coast and now the fever
rages where he is, and the revolution is
under full away. He hated to see us leave
there and, like others who desired all the
physicians possible to stay, offered almost
any money to remain.
"We couldn't do it. We preferred to
get out. It is a wonder I did not get
Killed when shot at in Sonsonate. I was
walking along briskly, but owing to the
rustle of the wind I did not hear the chal
lenge of the sentry. He never waited a
second, but raised his gun and fired.
Luckily he just missed me.
"It is this way pretty much in all the
towns of Salvador. Everybody is armed.
The grievance acainst Gutierrez is that he
has done nothing that he promised to do.
He knows his peril, too, or he would not
have four sentries on guard constantly out
side his door. He never ventures out either
day or night.
"General Jeffers told me," said Dr.
Keith, "that in his opinion the Govern
ment couldn't lastover twoor three weeks.
And he is in the service of the Govern
ment, too. He is an American and has
been down there for many years and has
been through many of the wars of Central
America. He was in the war in Honduras,
and in many other wars there. He is a
shrewd military man, the best there is
there, and told me this the last thing he
said before we left.
"It is Ezeta's country ,*or Alfaro's just
whichever gets there first and asserts him
self. In any event Gutierrez can't hold on.
He has got to quit. Yes, the belief is that
he has been putting money 'down' since be
got into oflice till now he probably has all
the money he wants."
Dr. Pena and Dr. Keith are at the Occi
dental. They intend to stay here for some
time. They believe that Manuel Casin,
who furnished the sinews of war for Ezeta
till his exchequer was exhausted, ia now
in Mexico.
Casin was the bold mariner who has
made a bjplay of righting duels on several
occasions. The theater of his heroic
achievements has been in this theater for
a part of the time. He was at the Palace
Hotel a f?w years ago when he challenged
Senor Andrea to mortal combat. The
senor was his old enemy in Salvador and
was on a visit here. The two succeeded in
much horse play, but never fought. Casin
next blossomed out as the manager for
General Ezeta and sailed with him in the
Barclay Golden.
WANTED TO VISIT HIM.
11. C. Cliamblin'a Deposition In the
Ashley-Baldwin Case.
The deposition of H. C. Cbaroblin of
Whitby farm, near Richmond, Va., has
been received and added to the papers in
the Ashley-Baldwin case.
Chamblin says in his deposition that he
one day received a letter irom Miss Ash
ley asking leave to come and visit him.
lie declined the offer, and soon after, as
he was riding along the road, he met a
young lady who was looking for Whitby
farm and who proved to be Miss Ashley
herself. He took her back to Richmond
and sent her home, but on the way she
asked him to buy her a ticket to where she
said she wanted to go and meet "Lucky"
Baldwin. The ticket was refused. This is
the substance of Chumblin's deposition.
Miss Ashley is suing Baldwin for "fT.^OGO
for betray in k her and Chamblin's deposi
tion will be a material feature of the case.
Increase in the Revenue.
The increase in United States revenue
â tamps for this district for the nine months of
the fiscal year has amounted to $600,000 over
the same period last year. It is thought that
f $i n 000 800B 00 for the year will reach upwaris

HAD A NARROW ESCAPE.
Stanley Lytton, an Electrician, Whirled
Around a Revolving Shaft.
Stanley Lytton, an employe of Paul Sei
ber, electrician, 406 Market street, bad a
narrow escape from death yesterday.
About 5 o'clock he was engaged in the
California Wire Works, Bay and Mason
streets, fixing up electric lights. He was
working on a ladder, close to a revolving
shaft, which was about, two ieet from the
ceiling and twenty feet from the floor,
when his clothes got caught in the snaft
and he was whirled round and round, his
body striking against the ceiliug at each
revolution.
His clothes were torn almost in shreds
and in desperation, to save himself from
being dashed to the ground, he clung to
the shaft with his left arm, which had
been broken. The friction on his hand
from the revolving shaft was causing him
great pain, and he had just made up his
mind to let go when the engine was
stopped. His yells for help had attracted
the attention of the employes in the works
and they had run and notified the en
gineer.
Lytton was released from his perilous
position and was hurried to the Receiving
Hospital in the patrol wagon. Drs. Weil
and Rinne found that both bones of his
if ft . arm wer e broken, and his right arm,
both shoulders and neck were badly
bruised.
OPPOSED TO HUNTINGTON
Mrs. Stanford's Representatives
Vote for General Hubbard
for President.
The Senator's Widow Not in Accord
With the Policy of the Present
Regime.
In the election for officers of the South
ern Pacific Company, which took place on
Thursday, Mrs. Stanford, the widow of
Senator Stanford, took special pains to be
placed on record ag being opposed to the
regime of C. P. Huntington.
It was given out at the railroad offices on
Marketand Montgomery streets, where the
election was held, that all the proceedings
had been of a most harmonious character
and that no opposition of any kind had
developed. But it has since been learned
that just the contrary was true.
Shortly after the* arrival of General
Thomas H. Hubbard from the East he
had a conference with Mrs. Stanford and
that lady asked him to become a candi
date for the presidency of tue Southern
Pacific Company, but despite the tempta
tion thus held out the general declined to
stand.
But not discouraged by her failure to
secure an ally in the representative of the
Searles interests, Mrs. Stanford instructed
her representatives, Russell J. Wilson and
Charles Lathrop, to vote for General Hub
bard. Influence had also, apparently,
been u*ed on the Crocker interests, hut as
events showed, only with partial success.
Charles F. Crocker voted with the Hunt
ingtons, but Lis brother, Will H. Croceer,
refrained from voting. Had the Crocker,
Searles and Stanford interests stood to
gether the regime of Huntington would
have come to an end.
This was the first time since he was
elected to the presidency, six years atro,
that there has been open opposition to the
re-election of C. P. Huntington.
BETTER STKEET PAVEMENTS.
Letter of the Merchants' Association
to the Cycle Hoard of Trade.
The Merchants' Association has ad
dressed the following cordial letter to the
lately organized Cycle Board of Trade :
San Francisco, April 11, 1896.
Gentlemen: The Merchants' Association bids
your newly organized board greeting to the
public-spirited work of securing improved
pavements, bettor roads and attractive boule
vards for the City and County of >San Fran
cisco. Assurances of the encouragement and
co-operation of the Merchants' Association in
your worthy efforts have been given already
to the committees of your board, who person
ally called upon the ollieers of this association.
The board of directors desires, furthermore, to
extend a cordial invitation to the members of
your board to avail yourselves of all the privi
leges of this association, including the use of
its offices and library in the Mills building.
One of the cardinal principles of the Mer
chants' Association is the improvement ot the
highways of San Francisco. Correct drainage,
clean streets, noiseless pavements, adequate
illumination and beautiful boulevards are
among the most potent factors of municipal
progress. No city on earth has ever attained a
high degree of permanent prosperity without
these fundamental requisites.
It is most gratifying to witness the recent
awakening of the citizens of San Francisco to
the vital significance ot these questions in the
present and future welfare of our City. It re
quires only the concerted action of trie people
to bring about these beneficent results and
place our metropolis in the vanguard of the
progressive and prosperous cities of the world.

Flaherty, University of California, will take
the negative. The judges will be Judge Joseph
McKenna, Judge \V. \V. Morrow and A. C. Free
man. Governor Budd will probably preside.

THE KINGDOM IS LEANING
Attorney-General Fitzgerald on
the Police Commis
sioners.
SAYS THEIR TERM IS UP.
When He Gets Through His Pressing
Piesent Affairs He Will Look
After It.
Attorney Wirt still keeps busy in his ef
fort to secure tho ousting of Police Com
missioners Alvord and Tobin, who claim
to have a life claim on their jobs.
Speaking of the matter yesterday Mr.
Wirt said: "We shall have a walkover in
this matter when ie is brought to a test."
He said he had just called on Attorney-
General Fitzgerald and informed him of
his having secured important records re
lating to the appointment of the officers
named. The Attorney-General, he said,
declared himself as opposed to the life
tenure and heartily in sympathy with the
movement to terminate the long term.
"But," said Mr. Wirt, "everybody knows
that the Attorney-General has been en
gaged in a very important legal contest for
several weeks, in the United States Court,
in which the people of the State are greatly
concerned and interested. He suggested
for me to call on him as soon as he got
through with the case there, and bring the
facts and the records for consideration. I
shall do so.
"William Alvord and Robert J. Tobin
took the oath of office and were sworn in
by E. Burke, a Justice of the Peace, on the
sth day of May, 1885, as Police Commis
sioners of this city and county," said Mr.
Wirt. "It will not do for them to say that
they made and filed the oaths of office in
April. 1878. or at any time in that year.
The Justice who took the oath of office is
now dead, the old City Hall is torn down
and the Governor who appointed them in
1890 is dead, too, but many people know
and the records will show that the Justice
of the Peace was not elected and did not
file his oath of office until December 2,
1884, after he got notice and a certificate of
his election. This clearly settles all this
proposition which is involved. They filed
the oath on the same day of the year. On
the 11th day of July 1890, they abandoned
the oid fortification" sought a new one and
then procured ex-Governor Waterman to
appoint them and grant each of them a
commission, and they filed their oath of
office on July 14, 1890, in this city and
county, as the book of original entries of
official oaths fully shows, although the
oaths cannot be found in the County
Clerk's office.
"I have two certified copies of their
official oaths, which were filed in the office
of tne Secretary of State on the 14th day of
July, 1590," said Mr. Wirt. "These rec
ords, with the big gold seals of the State
on them, are conclusive presumptions that
each of them by their act and declaration
accepted the appointment and commis
sion, and have acted under and by virtue
of the same. The record which I have
here, and certified to by the secretary of
Governor Budd, shows by the entry of
record of July 14, 1890, entered in the offi
cial term of ex-Governor Waterman, that
he appointed each of them for a term of
four years, and not for their natural life.
"This makes it clear that their appoint
ment and term of office and commission
wholly ceased and expired in July, 1594.
That "since that time they have been
merely locum tenentes holding over and
waiting till some one should be appointed
to fill the vacancies, for the Constitution
provides that the term of such municipal
officers shall not be extended beyond the
period for which they are elected or ap
pointed. The late decisions of the Su
preme Court will sustain the propositions
here presented. These facts being true,
it seems that they filed their oaths of office
in Sacramento so as to make the matter
appear easy and seem a little quiet. The
legal counsel who advised them saw the
dancer and advised them to abandon the
old fortification. The records make it the
plainest case. It appears that the perpe
tuity of the kingdom is leaning over and
about to fall."

has been a wide field thrown open
for the ingenuity of all mankind.
The most wonderful ideas have taken shape
and most preposterous notions have been
spread around as to wnat some of these
wonderful inventions will do, or what they
will not do. Still, though the majority of
them have been failures under the test of
a< tual service conditions, enough have
been developed so efficiently as to well
lead us to believe that the time of the mil
lennium canuot be very far distent, since
the destructive powers of new inventions
are so terrible that men cannot survive
under their action. It is possible now to
fight not only on iand but in the air above
the land and in the water beneath it. I
propose to give here descriptions of a few
of the more wonderful weapons â not
puns- ami it may be stated that while in
one or two cases the development has not
been perfect yet it has gone far enough to
insure absolute perfection at no very dis
tant day.
Among the types of craft to fight under
water, the Nordenfeldt boat seems to have ;
achieved the greatest success. There are j
two types in this country, the Peacemaker, |
and another invented by a Chicago man, |
tiuit have seemed to be excellent till j
vlaced under water in working conditions, j
vhenit was found t hoy could not reach \
that point their inventors bad claimed for j
them. The Nordenfeldt boat is about 125 j
feet long by 12 feet beam and displaces j
â¢when submerged about 230 tons, but when \
light lt.s displacement is reckoned at 165
tons, it is driven by 1000-fiorsepower j
engines at a speed of 15 knots on the sur- !
face of the water, and al-out 5 knots when 'â 
y. submerged. lt.s boilers contain about 27 j
tons of hot water, while tanks on board!
contain li.~> tons of cold water.
When the tanks are full, the boat is sub- j
merged, and Ly the action of sinking pro- '
pellers cau be kept in a horizontal position I
fat any depth. The usual position in driv- ,
ing forward would be at a depth just sufli- I
cient to keep the conning tower alone !
above water, so that the captain can see i
where to direct the boat. In the conning
tower are instruments to show the depth,
the level and the course. The lighting is
done by electricity. In the bow are tor
pedo tubes, and when near a vessel the
boat is entirely submerged and approaches
to a distance sufficient to insure accuracy i
and discharges her torpedoes with deadly I
effect. J
Another successful form of submarine '
torpedo-boat is called the Waddington i
from its inventor. It is a boat of small
dimensions, only 36 to 40 feet in length !
and 6 in width, and is divided into three
compartments by two bulkheads. The end '
chambers are filled with compressed air !
winch may be needed for either respiration !
or for furnishing motive power, but the '
principal motive power is electricity which !
U stored up in accumulators of 600ampere
boon each, there bein X forty-five boxes
arranged in the central chamber, as seen |
in the illustration. The torpedo propelled
by this boat is also novel. It is of the usual
shape, but the motive power is derived
from the combustion of three rows of four
100-pound rocket-tubes filled with rocket
powder. The gas generated by the com
bustion escapes through a nozzle and acts
on a small turbine which revolves the tor
pedo s screw. A speed of twenty-four
miles, and good to run one mile at that
rate, has been secured and demonstrated.
Like the >ordenfeldt, this boat may be
entirely submerged or only partially
Another form called the Nautilus, which
13 submerged, runs forward and discharges
its torpedoes entirely by accumulated elec
tricity.
An'interesting design shown is that for
an aerial ship, which the inventor pro
poses not only to propel and direct against
the wind or wherever he pleases, but he
also expects to carry up into the air with
him a large squad of men, who shall be
employed in throwing down on the heads
of an enemy's army or fortress or town
high explosives. This is one of the proD
abilities of the future that has not yet
proved an entire success, but which un
doubtedly will ere long. Thus, for in

i Count Zeppelin's steerabJe balloon, which
can rise 1200 yards, travel eleven miles an
hour, carry two tons, slay up fully a week
and then descend without throwing out
either ballast or gas. When such success is
attained as seems in this case undeniable,
then the day is not far distant wnen pro
tection from overhead fire will be as neces
sary to men in fortresses as on board ships
of war.
The experience of the English in the
Egyptian war proved that railroad cars
might be maue into portable batteries, and
they constructed several armor-clad cars,
which were pushed by a locomotive, and
on board of which cars were placed field
guns and Maxims. The Fiench have car
ried the idea still further, proposing to
apply the system of carrying guns to sea
coast fortifications. All tiiat seems neces
sary is to throw up a long line of earth
worksâand since earth is cheap and sand
plenty on the seacoast this costs but the
labor â and behind these walls lay several
ttackfl on which shall ply cars with the
heaviest guns mounted on board. The
guns may concentrate quickly at any point
desired, and then as quickly be moved to
another. Being on the move would make
them difficult oojects to hit by shot tired
from warships, and it is but necessary for
them to stop an instant to fire ere going
forward again. But as it is a poor rule
that does not work m more than one way
the French also have constructed railways
for the purpose of transferring torpedo
boats and small vessels from one place to
another.
The bicycle has come to stay in modern
war and plays an important part, and not
only is it to be used in carrying scouts and
intelligence-seekers, but also for the trans
port of ammunition a,nd the wounded. A
wheel is shown fitted with a litter for
carrying the wounded, ana surely no am
bulance can be more comfortable or ad
justable than this "bike," nor move as
rapidly.
The providing of bread and other rations
for the modern armies is a difficult
problem. A number of devices to over
come these difficulties have been devised.
A field oven is represented and shows the
means by which it can be carried on two
pack mules. This oven will provide bread
for an entire battalion ; but while it is
per table a/id effective and ca>a be taken
anywhere, yet it has to be unpacked and
set up when wanted for use. This is a
drawback in an army advancing, and to
overcome this the traveling field oven is
designed and used by all foreign armies.
It contains an oven, a hot-water boiler, a
hot-air oven and boilers for coffee and
souj). It is intended for a company of 200
nie.i, and while the army is marching this
wagon, drawn by four mules and followed
by a fuel-cart. Is in full operation. The
apparatus requires four men, one to drive
the wagon, one to drive the fuel-cart and
two to cook. The bake oven for bread,
the roasting oven for meats and
thÂ« boilers for soup and coffee
may all be put in full blast
with the result tliat on making the halts
for night or noon the meal is ready for the
men, and the bread for the next day is
baked. And all at a cost of time 'and
labor far les- th:in the old method of every
man looking out for himself, and with in
finitttlv more comfort. If you can feed
your soldiers well, you can do anything
with them, provided they are the risrht
INSTINCT IN THE LOWER ANIMALS.
Not Infallible by Any Means.
IN the course of my rambles this morn
ing I came upon a despoiled nest
lyine beside the pathway.
i knew whose home it had been,
for I had watched the labors of the
pair of goldfinches building it and had
longed at the time to tell them they were
i not building wisely. To all appearances
i they had chosen well, but I knew what
! they, as recent settlers, oonld not be ex
j pected to knowâ that the scruboak in
'whose sheltering branches they had lo
j cated stood on the bank of a little gully,
up which at rare intervals the north wind
tore madly, shaking and twisting the
growing tnings in its track until one
might fancy them shrieking for mercy.
But alas! I am not versed in the lan
guage of birds, and I was forced to leave
them to nature's not always tencer teach
| ing. They completed their nest just in
j time for the visit of our last norther and
the inevitable result confronted me this
morning as I strolled that way.
The owners of the little house had fled,
so I brought it with me and it lies upon
my desk now, a pathetic reminder of the
instinct that failed. Or, no, instinct never
fails its possessor. If the birds had been
| governed by instinct in their choice of a
j location for their nest they would have
made no mistake, but their blunder alone
is sufficient proof, were one needed, that
they are guided by reason. For reason
implies the possibility of error. Perhaps
it is not too much to say that the more
highly developed the reasoning faculty the
greater the possibility of its going astray.
It is to those orders that have no real con
sciousness, that are governed wholly by
instinct, that we must look for perfect
adaptation of life. We do not find the
tap-root of a tree making mistakes. It ex
ercises an ingenuity so subtle that Darwin
has likened it to the brain of animals.
But it does bettor for the plant than, a
kind of men ; butit makes no difference
what kind of men they are or however
much patriotism or enthusiasm for their
cause they may be imbued with, if they
cannot have proper sustenance either in
quantity or food.
Many other wonderful and curious in
ventions might be enumerated, including
the new men-of-war and new guns, but
they are now so .veil understood that no
description is needed. New powder?, guns
for throwing dynamite in large masses,
torpedoes themselves, guns that throw out
their projectiles a thousand a minute,
powders and explosives so terrible that
the old black gunpowder is mild in com
parison, armor to resist terrific blows, find
projectiles weighing over a ton, all the
wonders that steam and electricity and
Chemistry can call into play as agents in
the awful game of destruction of that most
precious of possessions â human life â all
these are fairly well understood, ami yet

been perfected as they ultimately will be.
brain coulii possibly do. It feels its way

ing every obstruction, creeping under and
about every barrier, sending out branches
at every available coign of vantage, until
the tree or plant is securely anchored,
deep down where the roots can not only
hold it firmly, but can hnd moisture and
food for the growing stem above ground.
The root of a tree has been known to twist
upon itself and push its way toward a
well dug years afiÂ»r it started upon its un
derground journey.
Some months ago, during one of the
congresses which Hie women of this State
are so fond of holding, a speaker made ibe
stalement that of all the human children
born half die before they reach the age of
rive years, and of these halt die before
they are one year old. it is probable that
this statement could not be successfully
denied. The infant mortality of the hu
man race is deplorably large, despite the
rapid progress science has made in the
last quarter-century. But the further
statement of the clever speaker, in this
connection, is, beyond a peradventure,
open to question. No other order of
creatures, she added, makes so shameful a
showing.
It is rather a popular sort of thing,
nowadays, to decry the human race. We
are wont to speak of poor human nature
with a shake of the head, and an air of
deprecating the outlook for its future. We
have got our government into hopeless
confusion. Our men are deteriorating
morally, our women are too ignorant and
too willful to bring up their children prop
erly, and the death rate among the young
of the race is in shameful contrast to the
showing among other creatures. So, too,
we are constantly hearing of the physical
ills to which human beings, above all
races, are subject.
Tnis would be a terrible arraignment,
were it true. As it is, the showing is not
flattering to the most highly endowed race
in the scaleof being. But if human parents
do not know how to care for their little
ones, aud to make the beat provision for
their welfare,Â»neither, on the whole, can it
be said that the lower animals excel them
in this regard, fl'he maternal reason would
seem to be no greater among them than
among us, while the maternal instinct,
probably because acting in a certain degree
in concert with the reason, is much less
infallible than in the vegetable kingdom.
As a showing for the king of beasts,
Henry M, Star ley is authority for the
statement that three out of every five
lion cubs die daring the procoss of cutting
their teeth. Other famous hunters testify
to an almost equal mortality among tiger
cubs, and of the grown creatures them
selves it is said that a perfect skin is al
most impossible to secure, so apt are these
tierce carnivora to be alHicted with mange.
Among sheep and cattle, even in the
semi-wildr.ess of great herds on the plains,
maternal instinct is frequently so feeble
as to endanger the lives of the young. Let
a mother-ewe lose sight of her lambkin for
even a brief period, and she does not recog
nize it again. Not even human mother
hood can show stupidity exceeding that of
the cows of India. These creatures are so
excessively maternal in their feeling that
one of them will not let down her mile
unless her calf is beside her. So the In
dian calf is not weaned, as is the custom in
other countries, but if it dies, or is slain, a
frequent occurrence, the skin is pre
served, and, wrapped about a bundle of
rags or straw, is exhibited to the mother
cow nt milking time. Smelling it, she is
quite satisfied, and will not hold back her
milk. Bach is the marvelous efficacy of
maternal reason and feeling in the brute
creation.
Herbert Spencer cites as a ridiculously
unmaternal act the fact that he once saw a
mother shake her baby because it would
not nurse. Unreasonable the act certainly
seems, but I bare often seen a mare kick
her foal or a cat box her kitten's ears for
the same offense.
Many curious instances of failure of both
instinct and reason along these lines occur
among the birds, really the most intelli
gent, next to humankind, of all the crea
tures. The reasonableness manifested by
birds in, the building of their nests and
the rearing of their young broods is one of
the most interesting things in nature. The
oriole will tie strings together, attach the
ends to the projecting twigs of a suitable
branch and swing its nest therefrom in a
fashion that has an almost uncanny sug
gestion of human wisdom. But the bird
will sometimes miscalculate >in tne selec
tion of a branch and cliooseone that is not
strong enough to hold the nest securely
and the wee birdlings will be spilled pre
maturely to the ground.
1 have seen the nest of a small bird, be
side whose eggs the unmaternal cowbunt
ing had deposited one of her own. This is
a favorite trick of the cowbunting, who
builds no nest and broods no young. But,
detecting the intruder, the - owners had
gone to work and built a new bottom to
the structure, cutting off not only the
alien egg,, but the rightful eggs of the
little hen - whoso nest it was. A
clever device, certainly, but how about the
wisdom and maternal feeling that deliber- I
ately destroys its ~ own offspring ' rather '
than aid in rearing that of a stranger? In
other instances; the mother bird has not
even been so clever, but has sat upon and
hatched the intending egg, at the expense
of her own, which, being smaller, were
kept from the feathered warmth of the
brooding breast until they were addled
and came to naught. .Nay, more, I
have known of ft ease wkere all thÂ« eggs
hatched, but the fledgling of the cow-
I bunting being larger and more vigorous
than those of its foster-mother, it seized,
I upon all the food the parent birds brought,
j and crowded and overrode its nest mates
until they suffocated or starved. But the
devoted mother went right on feeding the
selfish creature, who, so soon as it was
able, flew off without bo much as thank
you.
A careful watching of birds and their
ways bas not afforded me any evidence
I that the parent birds are able to discrimi
nate in feeding their young between the
gaping mouth that caught the last worm
or seed brought and the one beside it that
has had none. The morsel, so far as I
have been able to judge, is popped into the
[ beak that is thrust the highest, and there
is always a scramble for first place among
the birdlings, who, most distinctly and
despite the good Dr. Watts' assertion, do
not "in their little nests agree."
Thpre is no occasion here to speak at
length of those animals that are known
not intrequently to kill and devour their
own young. I am not endeavoring to
make any point of failure of maternal care
through viciousness, but only through,
blunder and stupidity, the two offenses
most frequently brought against hu
manity.
Nor am I contending that there is any
real parallelism in this regard between
the human race and the lower animals.
They only presuppose such parallelism
who criticize and" judge humanity by the
lower standard. The possibility of exer
cising reason presupposes the possibility
of error in its exercise. The human being
possesses reason, intelligence, in a far
higher degree than does the brute. Ha
possesses, moreover, the power of learning
from experience and of handing on the
wisdom thus gained. And out of the ac
cumulated knowledge of the ages has
grown the sense of moral obligation|which,
among other things, prompts such super
ficial criticism of the race as I have quoted.
But it prompts other things as weli, and
through obedience to those other prompt
ings the human race, the wretched,
groveling, feeble human race, makes the
best showing of any order on eartn, in the
intelligent rearing'and care of its young.
It most certainly should do so. lam
not offering this statement as a source of
pride. There is little enough occasion for
pride in the progress we have yet made,
but the statement can be made in contra
diction to sweeping comparisons between
man and the brutes.
But my wee eoldtinches were not dis
heartened by the failure of their first
building enterprise. I am fairly certain
that it was the same pair I saw, as I con
tinued my stroll, hard at work making a
new nest, this time, as nearly as I could
judge, in a thicket of wild briar-rose, wild
blackberry and megarrhiza, and there
should fate be propitious; should no soar
ing hawk swoop down upon the parent
birds; should no stealthy snake or prying
squirrel discover and dine off the eegs
should no wanton schoolboy find and bear
off the nest, or, should no chance passer
frighten away the little hen. they will rear
their brood and send them forth to glad
den the streamside willows with their
sunny color and cheery song.

TO write in detail the life-story of
\ Don Carlos M'Arti would require
j many months' work and it would
JL make a book of thousands of
pages. At present his home in
this City is at 1713 Broadway. He is pass
ing his days quietly enough now, but
during his life he has, perhaps, seen more
actual naval warfare than any man now
living.
This sketch can only briefly outline the
principal events in a most exciting career
that extended over nearly a quarter of a
century. In that time Don Carlos fought
against five different nations and aided in
â even] expeditions against pirates. He
also did his share toward putting down a
numb.T of insurrections, rebellions and
mutinies. During his years of service
very few weeks passed without giving him
a chance to smell powder. Cannon-balls
and bullets by the thousands have passed
within a few inches of his head and he
has seen so many men killed by his side
that he has lost count of them.
Although haring a Spanish title Don
Carlos M'Arti was not horn in Spain, but
in Ireland. That was fifty-four years ago,
cud the priest who baptized him gave him
the name of Charles. His memories of
his home are raiher dim, as it was

broken up by his going to sea and his
parents coming to America.
At the age of 14 Charles, as lie
â was then called, enlisted for ten years
as an apprentice in the Briti-h
frigate Royal George ana his vessel
at once started for the war then being
waged in China. He got plenty of excite
ment on this trip serving in the capacity
of ''powder monkey." The Royal George
wa9 in several engagements with land
forts and junks. There was a great deal of
hot fighting and a large number of men
killed. Charles was one of the landing
party at the taking of Hongkong. Be
fore the Chinese war was over he was
transferred to the Nyrnphe ana did several
months' service in the Crimea.
When the War of the Rebellion broke
out in this country Charle3 waÂ« most anx
ious to leave the British service and take
up arms for the Union. His parents had
sent him money and he had received word
that hia father was in the held. This
caused him to desert his ship, but as he
had become an exuert gunner diligent
search was made which resulted in his be
ing captured and put in irons for a time.
Soon afterward his father was killed at the
battle of fchiloh and he determined to re
main in the British service until his time
was up and make a careful study of gun
nery.
It did not take him long to get into
service again after he was honorably dis
charged in 1806. He was offered induce
ments by his officers to re-enlist, but pre
ferred to try his hand in another part of
the world, and joined tne Peruvian frigate
Independence, then being lilted out in
Liverpool for the war against Spain. At
the same time the ironclad Huascar was
beinc constructed at Birkenbead, and
when it was finished both vessels started
on a cruise together. They arrived at ltio
Janeiro at the same time, and wbilfl there
Battle Between the British Man-of-War Shah and the Peruvian Rebel Ironclad
liuascar.
[From a sketch by an officer present.)
A SEA-FIGHTER
FOR TWENTY-THREE YEARS
the young Irish gunner was transferred
to the Huascar. When his abilities became
known he was given the first position in
the turret and the title of Dan Carlos
M'Arti. From that day his history and
the history of the Hua'scar are woven to
gether.
The Huascar wÂ»s scarcely a montn old
when the first man was killed on her
decks. It was a cold-blooded murder on
the part of Commodore Salsado, who split
the head of a young .English lieutenant for
being absent in llio Janeiro without leave.
Charges were preferred against him, but
the commodore made up his mind to tret
out without paying any attention to them.
He attempted to pass the forts with both
vessels, but they were fired at and struck
several times. The Independence turned
back. The Huascar, however, did succeed
in getting away, but came back. Commo
dore Salsado knowing the Independence
would be held. He was acquitted on the
trial, as it was shown that the murdered
man was a hard character, who had served
in the Confederate navy.
Both the Huascar and the Indepen
dence left llio Janeiro on a Wednesday in
May, 1866, and on the following Sunday
Don Carlos M'Arti fired the first gun from
the ironclad's turret. It was not much of
a right, but the Peruvians came out of it
with two Spanish ships to show for tlvMr
trouble. One was sent around the Horn
to Callao and the other was sunk because
there was no crew to put on board of her.
This was the beginning of the Huascar's
j fighting, and before she had passed
I through the Straits of Magellan Don
! Carloa had trained her guns on over a
| dozen vessels. Everything hostile was
j either sunk or captured. There had been
a number of hand-to-hand fights, and the
decks of the Huascar at times literally
i ran with blood.
When tne latitude of the Horn was
reached the ironclad struck her first cale,
and for a time it looked as if she would go
to the bottom. The Huascar was the first
vessel of her class to enter the Pacific,
and the long, heavy seas swept over her,
so that she was liandlei with great diffi
culty.
The war with Spain lasted many months
and there was fighting nearly every week,
so that Don Carlos was almost constantly
in the turret working his guns. By the
time Callao was reached the Spanish fleet
in those waters was wiped out of exist
ence. The crew were paid off and given
their first shore liberty in over a year.
They were the lions of the hour and the
Peruvians could not do enough for them.
By 18G8 the war with Spain was prac-
I tically over, although there was consider
able trouble for a while on account of in
ternational complications.
In 1371 Don Carlos had a rest. The
Huascar was laid up in Callao with noth
ing to do. In 1872 a revolution started
because of the election of General Balto to
ttie Presidency. That made things very
j lively for a lime. The rebels were con
i tinually making attempts to capture the
Huascar and a number of bloody lights re
sulte 1, but the crew were well paid by the
Government and never gave up the ship.
In 1877 the Huascar met her first defeat
in battle. It seems that another revolu
tion started that year and on some pretext
the Huascar was sent to Lima, where she
met a grand reception. It turned out to
be a revolutionary plot. The first night
l in port the officers' attended a dinner given
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 12, 1896.
in their honor and while the y were absent
the Huascar was captured by the rebels
and sailed out of the h:Â»rbor. At a point
down the coast the rebel leader, Don
Pierola, came aboard and took command.
Don Carlos M'Arti, who was aboard at the
time of the capture, was made a prisoner
and told that he would either have to work
the guns or be put in irons. He was put
in irous ana the Huascar began a career
little short of piracy. Merchant vessels of
neutral nations were robbed of coal and
provisions. The Independence was sent
after the Huascar, but of course would not
right the ironclad, and the rebels had
things all their own way until the English
men-of-war, Khah and Amethyst, got after
them to demand an account for depreda
tions against British commerce.
The Huascar had been in the harbor of
Ylo for several days when on the morn
ing of May 22, LK77, the lookout saw the
smoke of two vessels out at sea. Thinking
it was the Peruvian fleet, the rebel com
mander gave orders to prepare for action.
When the three ships met the British cap
tain asked Pierola to surrender, but he,
emboldened by his successes, refused by
saying that he would right as long as he
had a grain of powder left. He did not
fight very long, iiowever, as the first shot
from the Shah carried away the flag, and
in another moment an electric broadside
cleared the spar deck of everything mov
able. After firing a number of ineffectual
shots the Huascar made an attempt to
ram the Shah, but that vessel was handled
so nicely that she got out of the way, and,
turning around, delivered another electric
broadside tnat almost Dlew the ironclad
out of the water. All of her plates were
started, and she ran close in shore to get
out of the right. The Shah was injured
but slightly. During the night a fog came
up, and Huascar made her escape to Iqni
que, where Pierola surrendered to the Pe
ruvians, exDlaining the condition of the
Huascar by saying that he had battled
with and sunk the Shah. But when tuu
Shah steamed into port a few hours later
her captain was thanked for crippling the
Huascar, and by so doing practically end
ing the revolution. A number of men
were killed on the Huascar, but the Shah
had only one injured. The Amethyst took
little part in the tight. She fired a few
shots at first and then withdrew with
smoke coming from her hatches. It was
said that a hot-shot from the Huascar had
set her on fire, but this was denied by the
officers of the British vessel.
While the Huascar was being repaired,
Don Carlos had a chance to rest a few
months, and was then called to duty in
the war over the nitrate beds, with Chile
on one side and Peru and Bolivia on the
other. There was hard lighting from the
start, as the fleets of both sides were con
stantly on the lookout for each other and
spent their time in cruising from port to
port.
The first naval battle of that war was be
tween the Huascar and the Chilean cor
vette Esmeralda.near Iquique. Don Carlos
had his old place in the turret, and accord
ing to his story, the battle was fierce and
bloody. At this time the Hua-car was in
command of Captain Grau. Before open
ing fire, he asked the Esmeralda to surren
der, and for answer got a broadside, which,
however, did little damage. After several
shots that missed, Don Carloa put one
through the Esmeralda's boilers, render
ing her helpless, so that she drifted on a
reef, where she was rammed by the Huas
car and sank in a few minutes.
BefqVe the Huascar could back out,
Captain Prat and eight men of the
Esmeralda jumped aboard and a bloody
fight took place on the ironclad's decks.
The sentinel was shot the first thing
and the men put their backs to the
turret, making a bard fight. Captain
Prat was in the act of jumping for
Greu's tower, when his head wascut off by
an Indian seaman. The eight men were
finally killed, and the work of picking up
the survivors of the Esmeralda com
menced. Some of the Chileans refused to
be saved by the Peruvians, many of them
shooting at their rescuers while struggling
in the water.
While this conflict was goinp on the In
dependence had attacked the Chilean gun
boat Covadongo, but that vessel did not
stop to fight. She escaped by steaming
over a shoal, and when the Independence
attempted to follow Bhe struck a reef and
sunk. The Peruvians certainly had the
worst of the tight, as they had lost one of
their best ships and had only destroyed a
tl.ird-rate one of the enemy's.
The Huascar, in company with the
Union and Pilcomayo, went back to Callao
and shipped good crews. Then another
cruise along the coast began. When Iqui
qus was again reached the Chilean trans
port steamer Martise Quesino was cap
tured by firing one shot from a forty-pound
gun. She was taken in tow, but in a few
minutes had to be abandoned, as the
whole Chilean fleet was been entering the
harbor.
The Huascar managed to dodge them,
and then began a chase that lasted all the
next day, when the Chileans gave up.
W hen the Huascar reached Arica she was
almost out of coal.
Don Carlos fought in the battle of Anto
fogasta on August 24, 1879. Two Chilean
corvettesâ the Magellan and the Abtowâ
were hidden in the harbor when the Huas
car entered and came from behind some
English merchant-ships and gave her a
broadside. The shore batteries also
o P er }ed fire, but did little damage. A
shell from Don Carlos' turret struck the
mainmast of the Abtow, killing the engi
neer and eighteen sailors. Firing was
kept up all day, but toward night the
Chileans went back behind the English
merchant-ships and the Huascar withdrew
with the loss of two men.
On the Bth of October the Huascar went
to the port of Anatages. Captain Grau in
tending to destroy the Chilean troopships
there. But it happened that the enemy's
Meet was just around the point, aiid word
was sent there iv time to permit plans to
be made.
At 2:30 o'clock the next morning, when
the Huascar was attempting to leave the
harbor, intending to ateara to Arica, she
was surrounded by the Chilean fleet, the
commander of which had so distributed
his vessels as to make escape impossible.
The battle commenced at ten minutes
past 9 in the morning, and the first shot
was fired by Don Carlos from the turret of
the Huascar at the Chilean ironclad Alrai
rante Cochrane. It was only a common
shell and did little damage, but the Coch
rane returned it at close range and put a
ahot through the bows of the Huascar.
Both the Blanco Encalada and the Coch
rane poured snot and shell on top of the
Huascar. The little ironclad returned the
fire until her machinery was disabled, and
Don Carlos was the only man left alive in
the turret, the rest being killed by the ex
plosion of a shell that came in through the
porthole. The three vessels had by this
time come to cl>se quarters, and when Don
Carlos found his gun worthless he went on
deck and took part in the hand-to-hand
conflict raging there, never ceasing until
the last officer had given up the ship nnd
declared the Huascar beaten. Toward the
end of the struggle there was a great deal
of bravado on the part of some of the men,
but when it came to the pinch they showed
cowardice. One man told everybody to
jump overboard, as he was going to fire his
pistol into the magazine and blow the
vessel up. Many men believed him, but
when the enemy searched the vessel after
wards he was concealed in a safe place. It
was discovered later that he had not taken
any active part in the battle. There were
numerous other cases of the same kind,
and in fact, Don Carlos says, the only men
who really did their duty were the Ameri
cans and Englishmen who were in 'the
crew.
All the officers of the Huascar except
one were killed in the engaeement, the
first being Captain Gran, who was cut in
two by a shell in the conning tower. As
fast as an officer took the place he was
killed until the small space was piled deep
with mangled bodies. At this time pan
demonium reigned and the two Chilean
vessels continued to pour shot and shell
into the Huascar until her colors were
shot away. In all hfty-four men were
killed. This number would have been
much less had not a big shell exploded in
the cabin where the surgeon was at work,
killing him and twenty wounded men.
When the Chilean flag had been run up
on the Huascar she was towed to Valpa
raiso, where she was repaired and in two
months was ready to fight a^ain.
Don Carlos M'Arti lost everything he
had in the world when the Huascar was
captured by the Chileans. He did not
have a cent of money and there was no
prospect of getting any work. After
great hardships he managed to reach Pan
ama, where a frtendiy captain gave him
passage to San Francisco. He has made a
few voyages since coming here, one being
to the Arctic in the Rush, but never did
any fighting since that awful day on the
Huascar.
In spite of the many baltles he has been
through Don Carlos has never received a
wound except a slight burn on the back of
his hands. He has not a single scar to
show for all his fighting, but it has told on
him by making him look about fifteen
years older than he is.

WHY SOME MEN WILL NOT BE INTERVIEWED
BY "W. O. MORROW.
The newspaper interview, by the grace
of a perfectly natural desire on the part
of most people to be interviewed and the
wish of all to read interviews, has become
a marked feature of the daily news. On
this account there is much interest in the
phase of the subject presented by Cor
nelius Vanderbilt in his persistent refusal
to be interviewed. No question of etiquette
is involved in his case. No reporter would
think of seeking an interview with the
President of the United States or a crowned
personage of Europe. Even the Prince of
Wales may not be interviewed, although
he is one of the most democratic and genial
of gentlemen and could grant an interview
without any fear of disagreeable conse
queuces on the score of misrepresentation.
But etiquette forbids his being interviewed.
Mr. Vauderbilt's assigned reason for
refusing to be interviewed is that his
father was once incorrectly made to damn
the public in that hearty way that became
him so well. It is bitterly and persistently
denied that he ever gave vent to that ob
jurgation. These denials do little credit
totneold gentleman s independence of
character. He may never have said it, but
everybody will think he did, for every
intelligent person of any character and
force feels like saying it at times. Not to
say it, is merely to have some tact. It
behooves millionaires in business to be
tactful. Moreover, those who think that
the elder Vanderbilt's remark was so
dreadful a thing to say overlook the fact
that it never could have done the old
gentleman the least harm, and that, on the
contrary, it raised him in the estimation
of the thousands of brainy world-builders
who want to say it and are afraid, and who
acquire an added respect for the man who,
in a moment of petulance, blurts it out.
Vicarious swearing is more satisfying than
vicarious praying.
Cornelius Vanderbilt avoids interviewers
professedly ior the reason that they may
misrepresent him as they did his father,
and that hence his ability for making
money out of the masses may be curtailed
by the operation of a resentful feeling.
No other reason has been given, and we
must take that as all. It would be far
more agreeable to assume that as a man
"worth" $100,000,000 (note the significant
meaning which this decent word has come
to acquire in recent times) is a Hundred
million times as worthy as a man "worth"
$1, it would not be becoming to his supe
rior position to place himself on a level
with men of smaller worth who are will
ing to be interviewed. That need not be
regarded as superciliousness; we may call
it a self-appreciation. This in its proper
aspects is an admirable thing, for if it is
not vanity it is pride, and that is one of
the best things in the world. It is differ
ent from self-consciousness, which belongs
to girls of the adolescent age and to peo
ple who remain adolescent all their lives,
never maturing.
We are not even permitted to believe
that Mr. Vanderbilt has a lack of confi
dence in his own intelligence and tact
which, makes him avoid the dread inquisi
tor of the press. For ability to meet an
interviewer with perfect self-command, a
fine wit and a shrewd tongue is possessed
only by persons of uncommon intelligence.
The man who can lie glibly in a burst of
confidence is an artist. The impressive
person with a large and imposing manner
who overwhelms a reporter with his mag
nificent weight is a genius. The ability
to be interviewed is a fortune to its pos
sessor. It comprises brains, tact, a wise
assumption of becoming modesty and a
certain kindness of heart. It is as easy to
refuse an interview as it is to insult a
beggar or strike a woman. We are not
permitted to believe even that Mr. Van
derbiU's refusal to be interviewed is a
modest and gentlemanly confession of
inability to talk intelligently without in
juring his money-earning power.
On the contrary, we are forced to accept
the bald and naked explanation that, as
his father had once been misrepresented,
he also might be, and that his large inter
ests do not permit him to take risks with
misrepresentations which may affect his
revenues. That is the explanation given
by Chauncey M. Depew, who in giving it
seems to furnish evidence of a spirit
strangely out of harmony with his usual
aspect of kindliness. It means simply to
say that Mr. Vanderbilt, being of necessity
sordid, prefers a fearful to a tactful sordid
ness. In other words, as men of brains,
culture and kindliness regard the inter
viewer as an exceedingly useful imple
ment for advancing their worldly inter
ests, Mr. Vanderbilt must forego that ad
vantage by reason apparently of a fear
that in spite of the fact that the benefits
of an interview immeasurably offset its
dangers, Mr. Vanderbilt cannot turn that
circumstance to account in his pursuit of
money. If I were his nearest friend I
should be ashamed to make that confes
sion concerning him.
Many persons coming into conspicuous
positions blunder under the interview out
of sheer ignorance of the world and its
ways. They are unable at first to realize
that eminence, whether temporary and
adventitious or worthy and lasting, is de
structive of perfect privacy, and that the
newspaper is the commonly accepted
bureau of publicity and promotion. It
helps infinitely more than it hurts, and he
who is not aware of that fact has his first
useful lesson of the world to learn. The
tyro in the experience of being inter
viewed may resent newspaper inquiry as
an impertinent intrusion upon an exdu
siveness which no one has a right to pene
trate, or a ruinous interference with pri
vate matters with which the world can
have no concern. Resentment of the in
terview under such circumstances is
merely a confession of vanity without
wisdom in the one case and a lack of
adroitness in the other.
It is impossible for such persons to un
derstand that the newspaper above all
things else is the one perfect expression of
all the complex qualities of our civiliza
tion. If interviews seemingly of a cruelly
inquisitive nature, without a worthy mo
tive for their seeking, were not eagerly
read and thus demanded even by those
who denounce the practice of "prying into
private matters," they would never be pub
lished. The demand of the age is that
each person shall know what his neighbor
is doing. He who would run counter to
this spirit places himseif at a grievous dis
advantage, because the world is hard and
jeering and will not place a charitable con
struction on any endeavor to conceal what
it desires to know. The position of re
fusal is so out of joint with the rule which
moves the <race as to make the one who
occupies it signally conspicuous by reason
of his nonconformity. He is more than
conspicuous â he is grotesque.
Tnis suggests the shrewdness with which
some distinguished persons have appar
ently sought to make themselves oddly
conspicuous by avoiding interviewers. It
would be cruel* and perhaps unjust, to ex
plain the persistent silence of Edwin
Booth and Ellen Terry on that ground.
Booth was a sensitive, moody, morbid, ab
normal man, between whom and the roar
ing world that bellowed praises at his
feet was raised a wall that no human feet
could scale. Unhappiness was written on
every line of his seamed face and sat deep
and imperishable in his wonderful eves.
Following the assassination of President
Lincoln by Wilkes Booth, Edwin traveled
for many a dark day in abject wretched
ness and complete isolation. Even that
sorrow aside, the man was so stranee, so
shy, so unamenable to rules governing the
conduct of ordinary men, tnat sufficient
reason is found for his exclusiveness. He
who can be easily interviewed is wrestling
in a migbty struggle with the world. That
was impossible to Booth.
Even in Miss Terry's case a generous
reason might possibly be found. She
entered upon greatness in the height of
the time when actresses exercised the
special function now so generously em
ployed by prize-fightersâ that of talking
volubly through the press. Perhaps Miss
Terry, instead of employing absolute re
serve as a unique method of securing
valuable advertising by reason of assum
ing a startlingly distinctive attitude, laid
her course as a protest against the vulgar
ity of her sister artists. It would be very
much pleasanter, however, to contemplate
her in the role of a woman sufficiently
gifted to understand the art of adminis
tering a kinder rebuke. With a wise exer
cise of the eraciousness and sweetness that
distinguished Modjeska, the most widely
loved woman on the stage, Miss Terry, like
her, might have set an example to all
women of what a woman might do when
approached by an interviewer.
Perhaos, after all, Mr. Vanderbilt is not
so timid and sordid as his friends would
have us believe. The published portraits
of him reveal a fine upward curl of the lip
that distinguishes trie true American aris
tocrat from the proletarian fellow-country
men and from the aristocrats of Europe.
Perhaps he has the genuine courage, in
spite of the rueful explanation made by
his friends, to announce by his silence that
the time has come for a proclamation of
class distinction in the iJnited States. It
is clear that to be accessible to the press is
destructive of exclusiveness, which is the
essence of class.
Aa a matter of fact, class distinction is
as pregnant and overshadowing in the
United States as anywhere else in the
world. That must be so on a oasis of dif
ferences in taste and occupation alone,
without reference to differences on the
score of wealth. Even a rich American
cannot be an aristocrat unlesa he observes
a large set of rules governing conduct and
accepted as proper in aristocrats. It is
just as much to be expected that wealthy
persons of refinement should flock to
gether and constitute a class by reason of
a community of interests and opportuni
ties as that artists and writers should form
themselves into clubs and artisans into
trades unions. The question of the great
power which wealthy persons might exer
cise under this natural operation of com
munity interests does not concern this dis
cussion. The fact that classes must exist
and that a considerable proportion of rich
people must be expected to constitute a
class by themselves is sufficient here.
That being assumed, and it being a mat
ter of common knowlege and evident
necessity that wealth is a conspicuous and
directing force, in social as well as finan
cial matters, w>at would be more natural
than that an able and courageous pioneer
Mr. Vanderbilt. for instanceâ should step
forth and say with his silence what bis
father said with his tongue? The daily
newspaper is the bu3y engine of democ
racy, the typical proletariat, the great Jev
eler of the age. It records the adventures
of Swipes, the pickpocket, with the same
minuteness and fidelity that it gives to an
account of Mr. Vanderbilt's most gorgeous
"social function." Can we expect it to be
altogether pleasant to a man "worth"
$100,000,000 to see his interview published
alongside that of Blinker Murphy? That
Is not exclusiveness, messieurs and mes
dames. The Hne must be drawn some
where. Mr. Vanderbilt. if this is the ex
planation of his position, is a pioneer only
in the sense of his advanced position. A
beautiful and accomplished woman who
writes for one of our newspapers published
an incident some time ago which goes to
show that the spirit which may be urging
Mr. Vunderbilt to lofty soaring has been
already working insidiously on lower
levels. This woman, whom any man
would be honored to know, consented to
be introduced at a fashionable country ho
tel to a young man eminent in fashionable
circles, but wnen he was approached by
the well-meaning intermediary he declined
the introduction, remarking that he did
not care to know newspaper people ! If a
newspaper is the body and essence of a
proletarian spirit why should not those
who produce it be of a class corresponding
and therefore inferior, or at least apart?
Perhaps, if Mr. Vanderbilt has not been
misrepresented by bis friends in their
efforts to prevent his being misrepre
sented by the newspapers, he is aware that
a powerful though silent sympathy is
working with him all over this republican
land.
And yet there are some satirical weekly
papers in New York ridiculing the "swell
set" for being so eager to see accounts of
their "functions" (another decent word
gone astray) published in the daily press.
This appears incongruous if the satirical
papers are right. Shall we say that be
cause the newspaper is the spirit of the
commonalty it may not De used as the
mouthpiece of the exclusiyes, and yet that
it shall serve as the bulletin of their social
festivities? Here is the headaching prob
lem. Possibly the solution lies in the
assumption that the policy of exclusive
ness has not yet been highly developed.
It would seem that even Mr. Vanderbilt
might with wisdom regard the newspaper
as being useful in the sense of a caterer.
If we accept the proposition that pub
lished accounts of the artistic and very
beautiful festivities of the rich cannot
have an unwholesome effect, but on the
contrary serve as an incentive to the poor
to acquire wealth and with it to enjoy the
good and elevating things of life, what
are we to do with the proposition that as
excluni/es we may not talk through the
press?
Well, life js hard enough without per
mitting the heart to be cracked over
matters like that. Out of the present
seeming chaos segregation may come in
time. No one thing in this mad world
stands alone, and no one thing springs
spontaneously into existence, but is the
product of innumerable other things ob
served and overlooked. It is easier to
criticize Mr. Vanderbilt than it would be
to suffer the hardship which he has placed
on himself. In these garrulous times a
gag is more irksome than a prison ; it is as
painful as that sort of bond which the
necessity for concealment lays upon the
tongue.
It is very much pleasanter to reflect that
whatever may be* Mr. Vanderbilt's per
sonal foibles he is a man of great wealth,
which he might be induced to employ in,
part in doing good for California and its
people. That a trivial incident of his life
has been here employed for ulterior pur
poses might safely "be regarded as that
tribute to his eminence which notice of any
peculiarity in hid conduct may be taken to
indicate.
CALIFORNIA'S RESOURCES
General Chipman's Sixth An
nual Report to the Board
of Trade.
Remarkable Increase in Exports of
Nuts, Fruits, Vegetables, Wine
and Brandy.
Some very interesting statements are to
be found in the sixth annual report of
General N. P. Chipman to the Board of
Trade. The report deals principally with
the exportation of California nuta, vegeta
bles, fruits, wines and brandies. General
Chipman, who is chairman of the commit
tee on the industrial resources of the
State, gives much statistical data of value
to the producer and exporter. During tho
year 1895, he says, 48.871.1 ten-ton carloads
of the products named were shipped out
of the State, bein^ a gain over the pre
ceding year of 5346.4 carloads. Continu
ing, General Chipman says:
In 1890 I undertook to show that the value
of our fruit exports was greater than the value
of our wheat exports. The figures were a
surprise to every one who*hadjsnot carefully
studied the situation. Fruit then brought
prices nearly double the prices of 1895. Wheat
was figured at 70 cents a bushel. Our fruit
then exceeded in value our wheat by half a
million dollars. Since then the wheat has
fallen off in valne and also in yield. Fruit hai
fallen in value, but has more than doubled in
yield.
I fully believe thtt the limits of profitable
fruit-growing in California have not by any
means been reached, nor do I think they are
likely to be. The reasons for this beiiel I have
many times stated in these reports and else
where, and I need not repeat them.
The reasons are as sound to-day as they were
five years or three years ago. They rest upon
unchangeable laws of nature; upon conditions
surrounding ns and surrounding the regions
where our markets are that cannot change.
California, in my judgment, must remain
the orchard of America. Periods of depression
may diminish profits; accidental pood fruit
crops in the Eastern States may occasionally
shorten our market and lessen prices, but. as a
permanent and generally profitable industry,
fruit-growing in California will continue to be
the great attraction and the chief industry re
lating to the soil. But the conditions existing
here that make this true will also make this
the great field for a perfectly diversified agri
culture and for intensive farming.

âChildren of the Ghetto.
In Israel Zangwill's "Children of the
Ghetto," this describes the Hebrew
poet Melchitsedek Pinchas. It is one of
the most interesting and picturesque
characters in the book. He is the dreamer
and the agitator of the great movement
for the return of the chosen people to the
holy city ; with his own hands he is to re
light the fires upon the hills oi Zion. In
the arrogant conceit of his great learning
he moves in poverty among the people
boasting of occult powers of his own and
with a sneer ever on his lips for those
about himâ English, Gentile and Jew.
In the London Hebrew colony it is
agreed that the character is drawn from
the life.'and that in the life Melchitsedek
Pinchas is Professor Naphtaly Herz Imber,
Hebrew poet, mystic, expounder of the
Cabbala, who the other day arrived in this
City and gives it out that he intends to
remain.
Certainly the description of his personal
appearance rits to him as do the comings
and goings of Melchitsedek Pint-has
through the now famous book. Looking
confidently in his glass Professor Imber
will deny the likeness.
"How can it be?" he will say. "Did I not
sit before the Boston School of Art for
them to paint a picture of Voltaire? They
paid me ?50 for the sitting. They called
me the Jewish Voltaire. The 'English
Jews call me the Jewish Carlyle, and so it
goes. It is impossible that" I should be
the clown Pinchas, for am I not referred
to by name in the iirst volume of the
'Children of the Ghetto,' referred to by
this same Melchitsedek as the national
poet of Israel ? One of mv songs 13 there
called the Hebrew 'Wacht Am Rhein.' "
This Professor Imber thinks is conclu
sive that Pinchas is not Imber.
Professor Imber has come into the West
to found a new cult. After 2000 years of
silence and mystery concerning" it, the
Cabbala is to be expounded. It is the year
6et by the Patriarch Abraham in which
the people shall receive the light. The
thirty-six Cabbaiistsâ there are but thirty-
Fix, and have ever been in the world hut
thirty-sixâ have chosen him to go forth
and preach the real truth. This is his
word for it. Last Tuesday, in the Temple
Emanu-El, he made his initial announce
ment of the truthâ and netted $60. Had
the price been but 25 instead of 60 cents
he would have made $100. But the money
is to be spent not on himself but in further
spreading a knowledge of the truth.
He is to continue here the publication of
his magazine Uriel, the ririt number of
which has been published in Boston. He
has already begun the formation of a class
for the teaching of his doctrines. His
nand is against the theosophists and every
other theorist, as it is against orthodoxy,
Jewish or Christian theology and all
other ologies; for his teaching's are those
of absolute truth â the only teachings that
may not be controverted and thrown
d..wn. That is why all those at which he
sneers still follow him; that is why the
Rabbi Voorsanger permits him to lecture
in the Temple Emanu-El; that is why the
theosophists themselves publish his "writ
ings, and why Rabbi Voorsanger's own
paper, the Jewish Messenger, prints
in its last issue something from his pen,
although the writing brands the rabbis
and preachers and professors of religion as
hypocrites. This, mind you, is the pro
fessor's own word for it.
The professor comes to San Francisco as
a poor man. His trousers are somewhat
stained with weather aDd wear and hang
high upon his coarse boots. The pro
fessor does not care. He places his
finger upon his forehead, and you un
derstandâfor it is the seat of the mind.
It is a rather remarkable face, with its
halo of black hair. It is swarthy, and
runs from tip of chin to top of crown out
ward to a central point at the nose. The
eyes are black and keen, and smiJine and
mellow, and convincing. The mouth is
most self-satisfied. It is wide and straight,
and when smiling, which is after each
annunciation iÂ« closed, the corners rising
and falling, sslf-convinced and self-satis
fied with its own wisdom while awaiting
the listener's expected assent. His mouth
looks best when it is closed, for his teeth
are discolored and some of them are miss
ing.
The profe^or is short and slight of figure
and makes his best appearance in his best
garment, which is an all-enveloping over
coat. He is occupying modest lodgings in
8 private house on upper Bush street.
Should you call upon him, which you are
quite welcome to do, you will catch a first
and somewhat startling glimpse of himâ
earthy face and bright black eyes
and spreading shaggy mane of hairâ as'he
croucbes down behind the railing on the
upper landing to catch sight of j t ou as you
enter, lor he has heard the door-bell and
realizes that tne people w,ho ling the bell
at this house must be coming to see him.
If he has other guests in the little back
room he has excused himself from them
that he might not lose what is going on at
the door. He will receive you with effusive
courtesy. If there be not chairs enough
he will himself sit upon the edge of the
bed.
<Â»n a stand there is a row of books and
another in the corner. There are con
fused heaps of newspapers, with marked
articles either referring to or written by
the professor. The books are all in the
Hebrew except a few pamphlets and a
.couple of little English dictionaries.

"Ah, yes, it is because I have the truth.
Ido not care for money. I am happy in
having the truth. I work with my hands,
and my pen and my tongue for my living.
"Ah* 1 can snow you many wonderful
things," he says, taking a sip of black
coffee from a glass. "See, here is the
Jewish Messenger. I have written a criti
cism of Dr. Graetz's history. When t^ey
learned I was going to do so they cried:
â¢Don't. We have invested ?1500 in this

Professor Imber is walking the floor as

"Something of my life? Ah! I have
had a wonderful career. Read this here,
it is the story of my literary life in the
Jewish Exponent of Philadelphia. I en
tered the literary arena at the age of 11 by
writing footnotes apon the 'Schulchan
Aruch.' A few years later I wrote a Cab
balistic explanation of the beautiful song
of King Solomon, known by the name of
the 'Industrious Woman.' At the age of IS
mv first poem appeared, it was dedicated
to the good Kaiser Franz Joseph, Emperor
of Austria, and my humble dedication
was acknowledged by a gracious gift from
the monarch in the form of a 25-florin
piece. My first little book of poems was
published by the aid of the great Jewish
philosopher, Abraham Krocbmal. This
little book was also accepted by the noble
Kaiser and was honored with another sign
of his grace in the shape of 50 florins. My
Pegasus was in his element when I be
came acquainted with the late Laurence
Oliphant, and gazing on the sacred mount
ains of Judan was fed by national food, and
my muse, inspired by these feelings, took
Zion's harp, which was hung upon the
desolate bushes, and the old melody of
the Levites began to echo through
the whole Holy Land. I saw how
my persecuted brethren docked to Mount
Moriah. gathering themselves unuer a na
tional Hebrew standard to restore their
old beloved country by building colonies
and settlements. I began also to lay my
hand to the work of restoration. Week
after week my national poems appeared
in tne two Jerusalem papers, Habazaleth
and Hazwi, to encourage my atilicted
brothers to go onward in the work of res
toration.
"In Rishon le Zion I wrote, by request
of the colonists, a Jewish national Mar
seillaise, under the name 'MishmorHa
jardon' (The Watch on the Jordan). The
poem has been translated into many mod
ern languagesâ into English by " Israel
Zangwill. It is given a place in Zangwill'a
book, 'The Children of the Ghetto '
where it is supposed to be sung by the poet
Pinchas and to excite his envy. This song
is still heard on the lips of the lovers of
Zion in Palestine. How often have I
stood at sunset, leaning on an old venera
ble hush. Rishon le Zion, when the colonists
left their field work marching home with
their plows upon their shoulders sing
ing the words of my 'Misumor Haiardon.'
I felt myself transported to that remote
age of the past when such songs were
heard from the happy tents of Shem, and
my eyes overflowed with tears of joy."
The professor pauses ajrain in his walk
to look at his reflection, still inhaling and
expelling through mouth and nose the
smoke of his ci arette.
"Before I left Palestine." be says, "1
published in Jerusalem my 'Barkai, 1 a
book of which a critic said, 'Barkai is a
national temple wherein each Jewish col

U hose were happy days," and the pro fes
sor, smiling in satisfied remembrance,
stopped to light another cigarette.
"Ah, Mrs. Olinhant was an angel. She
was a naive woman. She called me Her
zel; it is a pet name," and he took a long
draught of the cigarette, inhaled the
smoke and, as it slowly, slowly curled, ex
haled through his nostrils. "She wrote
to me while in Italy, and I was still in
Egypt, asking me tc come to her again,
saying, 'This is a call to my son to come
out of Egypt.' Ah, she was m)' inspira

prophesied one da} 1 that I should come to
California, be familiar with the many
places where she had been â for she had
lived several years in San Franciscoâ and
find great happiness there. She said I
would find my sepneuma â you know, my
soul affinity â in America, and so I did,
"I had no thought of coming here at the
time. Even after I came to this country
ray intention was to remain in Washing
ton. But circumstances have impelled me
to come here. I had completely forgotten
the prophecy, but at the moment that the
train stopped on the summit of the Rocky
Mountains it returned to me like a flash.
And I know that it is to be fulfilled. lam
to find happiness here. Everything tella
me so â after my ten years of trial I am to
find happiness.
"My trial? Ah, that was a lofe affair â
W-h-e-w!"
The professor stood in the middle of the
room, his feet wide apart, his left hand
with cigarette in air, the thumb of his
other hand caught in his suspenders, ac
cessible because of the open vest and coat.
His hair, from the excited handling during
his long monologue, was at odds with hin
head. "Whew!" he said, and then watched
with smilinc interest for signs of the inter
est which he felt sure the mention of a love
affair would excite. He pronounced "love"
as if it were written with an "f."
"Ah, it was terrible," he went on. "I
was in delirium. I was taken to a hospital
in Chicago. See, I have dedicated my lit
tle booklet, 'The Keynote to Mystic Sci
ence,' to her: I To my supreme and dearly
beloved Le.Ua G. Thayer of Boston, dedicated
in love and in truth by your llerzel.'
"Xo, she is not a Jewess. Her father
opposed our marriage and persecuted me
until I was ruined and had to leave Boston.
He is engaged in the shoe business there.
Ah, it was terrible. She came to me as a
pupil when I first went there to start a
class. She said, 'What shall Ido for you?'
I said, 'Use me, but do not abuse me.' 'Oh,
I shall never abuse you,' she said. But I
prophesied, saying, 'Listen, within two
years you will do so.' She burst into tears
and said it was impossible. But it has come
true. : mean that she has renounced me.
Is it not wonderful? I will show you in a
moment. I went to Chicago and from
there Rabbi Levy, finding that I was al
most insane and that she was coming to
me, telegraphed to her father to guard her
from me. And yet Levy professed to be
my friend. They asked me why I did not
marry a Hebrew girl, and I told them that
I could find none so spiritual as my
sepneuma and that made Mrs. Levy
angry. I wrote a novel while I was
there, but I do not know how far.
I could not remember from one chapter to
another, for my head was delirious with
thoughts of her. Her father forced her to
renounce me. She swore to him she
would never write to me again, and then
the next day she wrote me the wonderful
letter which I will show you. I taught
her to obey her parents, saying that I was
a spiritual man and must live out my pro
fessions, but her father could not appre
ciate me.
"I went to Cincinnati then, and Rabbi
Wise, head master in the Hebrew college
where they manufacture rabbis, slandered
me, saying I was doing missionary work
for the Baptists. I brought suit against
him for $5000 for slander. I have all
the documents were. It was a great case
Dr. Wis-i went to Chicago to find the Bap
tists who baptized me and made affidavits
about it. But the Baptists went on the
stand and swore they had never seen me
I was about to win the $5000 suit when I
fell sick and l dropped it.
"Then I went back: to Boston and started
my magazine Uriel, but I had little money
at that time. My girl's father persecuted
me, sayiiig I had hypnotized his daughter,
and I lost all my money. But the first
number of the magazine is out and I will
continue to publish it here. Now I will
show you something wonderful."
From among the mass of other papers
the professor unfolded with great care a
half uozen sheets of yellow, worn and
creased letter paper, ciosely written over.
"It is tne last letter from my sepneuma.
Read it. Such expressions oi love you
never heard."
And while the reading is going on the
professor walks the floor and talks, ana
stops before the glass to smile. "Is it not
wonderful?" he says. "She swore to her
father that she would never write to nie.and
the next day wrote that. Gas, to be sure.
I think it ought to be printed, don't you?"
Here is something of the letter. It is
dated at Clifton, Mass., June 20, 1893:
My darling Herzel, thou dear one whom I
have once or twice called "my husband." in
anticipation of the time when our lives should
be as one. Oh, darling, listen with patience to
what I am going to say. .Last night papa called
me to have a private talk with him. I felt
what was coming and my knees trembled, but
I sent UB a prayer to the dear God to sustain
me. It seems that yesterday morning papa re
ceived a telegram from some unknown person
in Chicago sayine, "Uimrd Lila, from Imber."
Well, darling, it came to the point that papa
said I must choose batween my duty to my
parents and my love for you. Oh, cruel words
that they may seem, after all my vows of love
to thee, my precious. Yet I was forced to it.
I felt, dear, that it would be less terrible
for me to die than for two or three.
And papa said that if I should marry you
it would kill him and my mamma. And if
such should be the case, very likely I should
die of a broken heart. For who of any princi
ple could bear tlie thought of killing his par
ents, to whom he owes so much? I could not
be happy, darling, in your arms if I thoug ht I
was killing my parents. And so, dear, O thou
whom my heart truly loves, it is probable that
I shall be prevented from continuing our
sweet correspondence.
Then the professor turned to himself
again.
"The Cabbalaâ the truth which I have,"
he said, "gives me universal knowledge.
Knowledge comes to nic at desire. Igo to
a Btrange land, and with no previous
knowlrdgo I at once speak the language
with the perfection of the most learned
native. 1 never studied music, but lam a
regular correspondent of the leading musi
cal journals and author of a booklet oil the
music of the psalms and the ancient anno
tation. I have not studied medicine, but
I exposed the fallacy of the Keen lymph
and destroyed faith in it. I have shown
the theory of evolution to be false. I
could cure the sick, but I will not descend
to charlatanism. It is my mission simply
to spread a knowledge of truth."
The visitor remarks that all the world is
wondering just now of what the newly
discovered X-ray is composed â which the
professor himself had mentioned as being
the most wonderful of discoveries and a
demonstration of the truth of Cabbalistic
prophecy.
Putting his finger to his nose he replies
smiling, and without hesitation: "I will
tell you. I will write it. I will give you
a new theory of the light of the sun. See,
you may note bow readily I write. I
write better than I talk."
Taking a seat at a table, interrupting him
self at every paragraph to talK, he rapidly
wrote out the following:
The Cabbala and the X Ray.
There is a legend in the Talmud that when
the prophet Enoe-h pleaded to the generation
of the ilood that they should return to the Lord,
otherwise he would take away his luminous
candles â the sun, moon and stars â they
proudly replied: "Let him take them, we do
not need them, as we have stones which will
illuminate our world just as good as God's
candles." We know that the generations of the
ilood were at the highest pitch of civilization,
and the flood has destroyed a culture which
was cultivated many millions of years. From
the above legend, which is like most
of the legends, which are the coffins wherein
truth lies muininitiedâ from the above legend
we can learn that they, the generations of the
flood, were so civilized that they knew how to
prenerve and concentrate the scattered prisms
of life in crystals to free themselves from the
caprice of nature.
A PROI'HECY.
The Sohar, the Bible of the Cabbala, says
that in the year 5550 in Jewish oalendation,
which is in the Christian era 1896, the light
will be revealed to the world. Another version
says in the year 5566, which is 1906. Perhaps
it "means the perfection of the revelation, for it
takes a decade from the discovery up to the
perfect knowledge of the discovered matter.
"Is it not wonderful?" said the pro
fessor, when he had read it all.. "Now I
have told you I can cure the sick. I will
show you that I can cure myself. You
see I am suffering with a severe cold?"
It was very evident.
"When you have gone I will concentrate
my mind for a few moments and the cold
will be gone. I will prove it to you. I
will come to see you this evening to prove
it."
And he did. That evening he traveled
two miles to stand under an electric light,
and pointing to his nose and wearing that
convincing smile exclaimed: ''See! I have
done as I said."
This is the picture of Naphtaly Herz
Imber, mystic, who has been like-ned to
"one of those weird gargoyles in the
towers of Notre Dame, 1 ' and who is said to
be the material out of which Israel Zang
will has made his Melchitsedek Pinchasof
the "Children of the Ghetto."
Zangwi il portrays the character in de
tail in the tenth chapter of the book. Now
look upon this picture .
THE NEO-HEBREW POET.
He came through the open door, knocked
perfunctorily at the door of the room,
opened it and then kissed the Mezuzah
outside the door. Then he advanced,
snatched the Kebbitzin's hand away from
the handle of the coffee-pot and kissed it
with equal devotion. He then seized upon
Hannah's hand and pressed his grimy
lips to that, murmuring in German :
''You look so charming this morning,
like the roses of Carrnel." Next he bent
down and pressed his lips to the Reb's
coat-tail, finally he said: "Good morning,
sir," to Levi, who replied very affably,
"Good morning. Mr. Pinchas." "Peace be
unto you, Pinchas." said the Reb. "I did
not see you in Shool this morning, though
it was the new moon."
"No; I went to the great Shool," said
Pinchas in German. "If you do not see
me at your place you may be sure I am
somewhere else. Any one who has lived
so long as i in the Land of Israel cannot
bear to pray without a quorum. In the
Holy Land I used to learn for an hour in
the Shool every morning before the service
began. But lam not here to talk about
myself. I come to ask you to do me the
honor to accept a copy of my new volume
of poemsâ 'Metatoron's Flames.' Is it not
a beautiful title? When Enoch was taken
up to heaven when yet alive he was con
verted to flames of hre and became
Metatoron, the great spirit of the Cabbaiah.
So am I wrapped up into the heaven of
lyrical poetry, and I become ail fire and
flame and light."
The poet was a slim, dark, little man
with long, matted hair. His lace was
hatchet-shaped and not unlike an Aztec's.
The eyes were informed by an eager bril
liance. He had a heap of little paper
covered books in one hand and an extinct
cisrar in the other. He placed the books
upon the breakfast-table.
"At last," he said. "See, I have got it
printed â the great work which this ignor
ant English Judaism has left to molder
while it pays its stupid reverends thousands
a year for wearing white ties."
"And who paid for it, now, Mr. Fin
chas?" said tne Rebbitzin.
"Who? Wh-o-o?" stammered Melchi
sedek. "Who but myself?"
"But you say you are blood-poor."
"True" as the law of Moses! But I have
written articles for the jargon papers.
They jump at me â there is not a man on
the staff of them all who has the pen of a
ready writer. I can't get any money out
of them, my dear Rebbitzin, else I
shouldn't be without breakfast this morn
ing, but the proprietor of the largest of
them is also a printer, and he has printed
my little book in return. But I don't think
I shall fill my stomach with the sales.
Oh! the Holy One, blessed be he! Bless
you, Rebbitzin, of course I'll ta^e a cup of
coffee; I don't know any one else who
mates coffee with such a sweet savor; it
would do for a spice offering when the
Almighty restores us our temple. You
are a nappy mortal, Rabbi. You will per
mit that I seat myself at the table."
Without awaiting permission he pushed
a chair between Levi and Hannah and sat
down: then he got up again and washed
his hands and helped himself to a spare
egg
"Here is your copy, Reb Shemuel," he
went on after an interval. "You see it is
dedicated generally:
" 'To the pillars of English Judaism.'
The remark touched the rabbi in a ten
der place. It was the one worry of his life,
the consciousness that persons in high
quarters disapproved of nim as a force im
peding the Anglicization of the Ghetto.
He knew his shortcomings, but could
never quite comprehend the importance of
becoming English. He had a latent feel
ing thatj Judaism had flourished before
England was invented, and so the poet's
remark was secretly pleasing to him.
"They are a set of donkey-heads, but
one mu3t give them a chance of rising to
higher things. It is true that not one of
them understands Hebrew, not even the
chief rabbi, to whom courtesy made me
send a copy. Perhaps he will be able to
read my poems with a dictionary; he cer
tainly can't write Hebrew without two
grammatical blunders to every word. Js'o,
no, don't defend him, Reb Shemuel, be
cause you're under him. He ought to be
under youâ only he expresses his ignor
rance in good English, and the tools
think to talk nonsense in good English is
to be qualified for the rabbinate."
"You know very well," went on Pin
cha.~, "that I and you are the only two
persona in London who can write correct
holy language."
"S"o, no." said the rabbi, deprecatingly.
"Yes, yes," said Pinchas, emphatically.
"You can write quite as well as I. But
just cast your eve now on the special dedi
cation which I have written to you in my
own autograph. 'To the light of his gen
eration, the great. Gaon, whose excellency
reaches to the ends of the earth, from
whose lips all the people of the i^ord seek
knowledge, the never failing well, the
mighty eagle who soars to heaven on the
wings of understanding, to Ray Shemuel,
may whose light never be dimmed and in
whose day may the redeemer come unto
Zion.' There, take it, honor me by taking
it. It is the homage of the man or genius
to the man of learning, the humbie offer
ing of the one Hebrew scholar in England
to the other."
"Thank you," said the old rabbi, much
moved. "It is too handsome of you, and I
shall read it at once and treasure it among
my dearest books, for you know weil that
I consider that you have the truest ooetic
gift of any son of Israel since Jehuda
Halevi."
A
"I have! I know it! I feel it! It burns
me. The sorrow of our race keeps me
awake at nightâ the national hopes tingle
like electricity through me â I bedew my
couch with tearsin the darkness. 1 ' Pinchas
paused to take another slice of bread and
butter. "It is then that my poems are
born. The words burst into music in my
head, and I sing like Isaiah the restora
tion of our land, and become the poet
patriot of my people. But these English!
They care only to make money and to
stuff it down the throats of gorging rever
ends. My scholarship, my poetry, my
divine dreams â what are these to a
besotted, brutal congregation of men
of the earth? I sent Bucledorf,
the rich banker, a copy of my little book,
with a special dedication written in my
own autograph in German, so that he
might understand it. And what did he
send me? A beggarly five shillings! Five
shillings to the one poet in whom the
heavenly tire lives! How can the heavenly
fire live on five shillings? I had almost a
mind to send it back. And then there
was Gideon, the member of Parliament.
I made one of the poems an acrostic on
his name, so that he might be banded
down to posterity. There, that's the one.
No, the one on the page you were juat
looking at. Yes, that f s it, beginning:
Great leader of our Israel's host;
I sing thy high heroic deeds,
Divinely gifted learned man.
"I wrote his dedication in English, for
he understand neither Hebrew nor Ger
man, the miserable, purse-proud, vanity
eaten rnan-of-the-earth."
"Why, didn't he give you anything at
all?' ; said the Reb. "
"Worse 1 He sent me back the booK.
But I'll be revenged on him. I'll take the
acrostic out of the next edition and let
him rot in oblivion. 1 have been all over
the worid, to every great city where Jews
congregate. In Russia, in Turkey, in
Germany, in Roumania, in Greece, in
Morocco, in Palestine. Everywhere tha
greatest rabbis have leaped like harts on
the mountain with joy at my coming.
They have fed and clothed me like a
prince. I have preached at ihe syna

SOCIETY
THE past week, socially speaking.
was neither as quiet nor as uninter
esting as we were led to snppose.
Not a dr.y went by without some
social divertisement, which is as
it should be on Easter week.
Of course, every uiie naturally looks for
ward to the private theatricals to be given
by Mrs. Hager to-morrow evening at the
Native Sous' Hall.
This will be the event of the Eas-ter sea
son, and an unqualified success is assured.
Mrs. Ilager is the leader of local society.
and her entertainments have always been
qualified by rare tact and otiginality.
Leo Cooper, who is rehearsing the ama
teurs, ret-orts more than satisfactory re
suhb. The lady participant! will wear
Borne exquisite gowns, and the stage set
tings are to be dainty, appropriate and
handsome. There will be no elaborate
decorations of the hall; in fact, such an
arrangement would be absurd In the ex
treme. Bunting and potted palms, how
ever, will be used to take away the bare
effect of a public hall.
Preceding the performance there is to be
a series of three living pictures â "La
TobCa," after Harburg's celebrated pic
ture; "Summer iioon," by Leighton, aud
'"Reveries."
It would be well for those who â¢will at
tend to bear in mind that it is imperative
that cards of admission be presented at
the door; also, that it is a full-dress affair,
and that bonnets will not be allowed on
the floor. The performance will begin at
9 sharp, and the audience, it is hoped, will
be seated before the play begins.
There is to be dancing, provided the
young folks so desire it, after the perform
ance.

THE PADEREWSKI HAND~~
A Professor of Palmistry Secures a Very Good Impression
in Lampblack. /â ;
"This is the wizard hand that works
miracles, the dextrous sweep of which
over the ivory keys sets women into
ecstatic hysterics and drives men to drink
through jealousy."
J. B. Hargett, professor of palmistry
sat before a table in his oirke. upon which
lay a sheet of blackened paper, bearing
the imprint of a hand. Every line of the
hand was shown, even to the very finest
markings of the cuticle. It was a large
hand, with fingers rather short in propor
tion and wide apart.
''It is the truly artistic hand," said the
professor contemplatively. "It is the hand
of Paderewski. The impression? Oh,
nothing more than a sheet of lampblack.
I secured the impression at Los Angeles."
"I met the processor with some friends
at his car. They were about to pull out
when the thought occurred to me. Pade
rewski was perfectly willing, but when I
made the preparation of lampblack his
private secretary was very much alarmed
with the evident" doubt as to the effect on
that wonderful hand. I reassured him
with the explanation that it was nothing
more dangerous than plain lampblack.
Paderewski placed liis hand on the paper,
but did not press heavily enough and the
impression was poor. This is the second
attempt, which is much better.
"What do its lines indicate? Here is the
reading which I made at the time," and
the professor read from a manuscript as
follows:
"The first impression that I got from
this hand was that it was the product of a
cold country. Its grasp and texture were
those of a baseball-player. Its finer pow
ers were, however, apparent in ttie touch.
It shows the hereditary power of cold re
gions and nothing in "the development in
cident to blue skies and balmy breezes.
The skin and formation indicate hardi
hood. It is made for hard work and bears
the evidence of having done hard work.
It is capable of remarkable skill. It is truly
tde artistic hand. The emotional and im
aginary qualities are strongly marked â J

the qualities essential to success in hia
calling. There are four native ele*
menta necessary to the success
of an artist, and this hand
indicates their possession. The first
is feeling, which gives desire, enthusiasm,
force. The next is imagination, which
gives expression. The third is not a small
element in itself, ambition, persistence,
patience; the last the quality of execution.
This hand possesses these fundamental
qualities. Nothing snort of perfection
will satisfy the ambition of thisunequaled
artist. Nativa strength, physical, intel
lectual, moral and skillful â all these are
indicated by the form and construction of
the hand, ideality is strongly indicated.
"There is nothing comely, dainty or
charming about this hand. It has the
ouality of a high order of mentality,
friendship, honesty, good character and
hard labor.
"The marks of the hard labor are upon
it. I had not had hold of a hand which
impressed me more with sterling worth
and honest application than this. It doeg
not need the deceptive arts of the medium
or clairvoyant to indicate its quality. It
plays upon two sets of chords at the same
time; tue one in the piano and the other
in the breast of the auditor. He strikes
both with like force and facility and both
respond with their own music. There are
signs in this hand to show that there had
ben souls struck with deep and lasting
music. The owner has had quite a num
ber of love experiences from the age of 16
to the age of 84. Thesp experiences are
dotted here quite thickly at the rate of
three or four stalks to a hill. It appears at
about the age of 21 there was a marriage.
The marriage record is placed at about
that day. After mature manhood the
record of flirtation almost disappeared.
"There is a strong headline bisecting in
tellectuality with real and strong affection.
The affection like the skiil is strong and
ideal, hard to catch. There is indicated
just enough of the mathematical and
philosophical in his nature to balance the
emotional and imaginative qualities.
There is a great tendency to travel, lar^e
sensitiveness, a long life line and good
intuition."FROM THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH
IF the capital that is being used to
enable science to pierce to the outly
ing precincts of the universe through
trie illimitable heavens were turned to
the purpose Â°* exploring, in a meas
ure, t lie interior of the earth, does it not
seem likely that the result would be vastly
more protitable in a practical and mate
rially helpful way?
We gaze with unfeigned awe at the ob
servatory on Mount Hamilton, and we
consider with wonderment the vast amount
of speculation annually raised through the
glimpses obtained uy the eve of a scholar
Into the regions of the stars, which, to a
majority ol the inhabitants of the globe,
appear but little more than dim candles of
the night.
Verily, the study of the heavens is sub
lime; but a far mure important study to
the bulk of humanity is the unbeautiful
one of bread and butter. Every now and
then some millionaire immortalizes him-
Belf by giving a few hundred thousands of
his hoard to aid the investigations into
other worlds. It is a grand thing for him
to do, of course; but would it not be a
novelty, with in immortalizing tendency
as well, to have somebody with great
riches provide a eoodly sum, not with the
object of discovering the color of the hair
of the people in Mars, but of boring down
toward the center of the earth in cider to
rind what wealth is latent thereâ in order
to encourage all manufacturing industries
by bringing up fiom the hidden depths
the natural gas and the oil that may solve
forever the problem or light and fuel, and
benefit mankind to a degree unexcelled in
history?
Well-boring may be a rather prosaic oc
cupation; but the well-borer is, perhaps,
destined to enrich the general run of
mortals more substantially than any other
artisan. He may not push through to
< 'hma and permit of a pneumatic tube line
between here and the stronghold of the
heathenâ he may not do the Christian
missionaries that amount of service; and
he may not even go far enough to decide
whether or not hell is located near the
earth's center; but he may bore sufficiently
far to set at the wells from which gold in
various forms may be pumped up to an
eager wurid.
K. If. Hoagland, one of the leading well
borers of the West, winie engaged in drill
ing in the Puente oil district in Los An
peles County, eight years ago, learned some
things which he esteemed of great value
judcing from his experience in the oi
regions of Pennsylvania. The Puente dis
trict is thirteen miles southeast ot Los An
ge!eÂ«. Careiui observation convinced Mr
Hoagland that PuenU- was part of a grea
oil belt which extended through the Cit>
of the Angels. This idea he communi
cated to some capitalists, who were mucl
impressed with it. All the land in the
"oil belt" could have been taken up on lon
leases, if not purchased outright, ami a
comparatively small figures when tbe
present day is considered.
At tha: early stage of the proceeding
an expert, or professional expert. appeare<
on the srene. He knew all about the Penn
sylvania oil lands and was able to scent oil
indications from afar off. He was em
ployed by the capitalists to look over the
Los A.ngelea field. He did. His report
condemned the scheme, and he declared
that, as far as oil indications were con
cerned, they were merely seepages from
the mountains or surface showincs brought
down by the waters. The expert's de
cision waÂ« that the oil story had '-nothing
in it." To-day these capitalists are be
moaning their failure to act eight years
ago, when they might have secured con
trol of ail the oil in the city of perfumed
zephyrs and orange blo^sums. Two years
ago the predictions of Mr. Hoagland were
Where the Leakage From the Seas Is Converted Into Steam at the Root of the Volcano.
fulfilled. Oil wells were struck in Los An
pele:-: the oil belt became an astonishing
reality ; out these well? do not yield riches
a? tIK-y would have done under one cor
poration. Tiify are in small holdings.
Every man with a lot has ?unk a well and
the market has been flooded, until oil that
used to bring $2 25 a barrel is retailed for
50 cents the barrel.
"And now let us bring this subject right
home to San Francisco," observed Mr.
HoagluxL "The oil that is within easy
reach of this City should be developed.
Tli iÂ« would determine for us tne question
of cheap fuei for manufacturing purposes.
There ia oil in San MatÂ«*o County, ana
there iÂ» no telling but what it extends in a
belt rieht thmujch B*n Francisco and up
the coast. There are oil indications on
the other side o' us in Mann and Hum
boldt counties. Over in Contra Costa
County, at Minor's ranch, near San Pablo,
oil and gas come up naturally out of the
ground. If capital will undertake the
work the benefits to be derived from it
will be inestimable to the bay region."
Through some land a well-borer might
drill for a year and get no satisfaction in
any flow of oil or water or gas. An ex
perience like this came to Mr. Hoagiand.
A Southern California ranch-owner en
gaged him to bore a well near the
rancher'a house. Water was scarce in the
vicinity. A 'peculiar notion struck the
man. "He owned a big tract, and he had
$15,000 in cash. If he could strike water
in heavy flow his fortune would be made
by his own irrigation scheme. If he could
strike gas or oil, why so much the better.
"I've cot $15,000, "said the rancher, "and
I'm going to keep you boring till you
strike something I want or till I'm broke."
Mr. Hoagland suggested that the lo
cation of the well was unpromising, but
the man knew where he wanted it, and his
say went. The well was bored to a depth
of 2S.'>o feet ; the rancher went broke in it
almost, and he got neither oil, gas nor
water, i^omo speculations turn out just
that way.
"In San Mateo County," said Mr. Hoag
land, "I drilled a well* over 1000 feet in
depth, and struck salt water. Now this
was 700 feet above sea-level and about
eight or ten miles from the coast, on Tar
Creek, a tributary to the Pescadero. We
were aiming for oil at the time. The most
curious part of the outcome was that the
salt water flowed every seventh day.
Somebody styled it the Holy Well, as
there was no accounting for the phe
nomenon."
Mr. Hoagland has been in the well-bor
ing business since he was 15 years old. He
was born and brought up in Bradford
County, Pa., but for twenty years past
he has been engaged in his occupation on
this coast. It was he who drilled the
Moody Gulch oil wells, near Los Gates, in
Santa Ciara County, and from them several
thousand gallons of petroleum of a supe
rior quality have been pumped. A gas
company in San Jose holds a contract for
all the oil that can be produced at Moody
Gulch. The San Mateo oil wells yield both
gas and oil; the oil product being of a
high grade, but running only about live
barrels a day. This brings $4 a barrel in
San Francisco.
The old-fashioned well-borer worked
down from 10U to 150 feet a day in ordi
narily good ground. He might run into
clay, quicksand, hardpan or cobble. There
are instances where men have drilled for
! twelve hours to get throuch twelve inches
i of rock; for some of the rock is so hard
! that it would cut glass.
Hoagland has invented a new method of
hoisting and lowering the boring rods by
j which the speed of boring is accelerated,
! and on easy soil he can make from 200 to
j 250 feet per day. while from seventy-five to
eighty feet of rock drilling can be done in
â  the same period.
At 250 feet per day the center of the
â  earth would be reached in about 280 years,
I so that there is nu probability of any of
â  the present generation learning how hot it
! is down there unless somebody springs a
. scheme for drilling with much greater
' rapidity. But capital may well ponder
over tie idea of boring for oil or of boring
down to see what can be pot. The earth
is chockfull of precious things, and gold is
only a small fraction of the value of the
; contents of the interior of this mundane
â  sphere. This advice to the rich is quite
' similar to the advice which has oftentimes
i be?n given to the poor to "get in and dig."
But there is something more to this sub
â¢ ject of well-boring;- One of the great mo
tive powers of the world of industry is
1 steam, which "scorns the strength of our
puny hands as the tempest scorns a
chain." Now, the cost of the production
of steam, the fuel, machinery, etc., is a
; most important item. If mankind could
â  obtain all the steam-power necessary in all
the fields to which it is applicable at barely
nominal expense the benpfits would be be
yond all calculation. Why may not some
well-boring genius of the future convert to
industrial use the steam that is imprisoned
in the bowels of the earth and that is now
and then- finding vent through the craters
of volcanoes? Old Mount Diablo, at our
very door, is an extinct volcano, and it is
not*impossible that the upward expansion
of vapors from below may some time blow
the cover of his chimney off again. The
Pacific Ocean is girdled with volcanoes.
Some geologists connect volcanic phe
nomena with internal lakes of liquid mat
ter or a central ocean of molten rock. The
floor of the sea, the beds of rivers and
lakes, are all leaky, and tbe subterranean
water percolates down cracks and joints in
vast quantities. Many believe that it is to
the enormous expansive force of perhaps

white-hot water finding access to and im
prisoned in some of the empty spaces at
the roots of volcanoes that the explosion
of the crater and the subsequent rise of the
lava column are due. It has been sup
posed that, somewhat like the reservoirs
in which the hot water and steam accumu
late under the Icelandic geysers, these vol
canic spaces receive a constant influx of
water from the surface which cannot
escape by other channels, but is in great
part converted into vapor or retained in
the fluid state at an enormously high tem
perature and unaer vast pressure. In
course of time the materials tilling up the
chimney are unable to withstand the up
ward expansion of this imprisoned vapor
and water, so that, after some premonitory
rumblings, the whole opposing mass is
blown out, and the vapor rushes u\> in the
well-known masses of cloud. Meanwhile,
the removal of the overlying column re
lieves some of the pressure from the water
charged lava, which therefore begins to
rise in the funnel until it forces its way
through some weali part of the cone or
pours over the top of the crater. After a
time the vapor is extended, the energy of
the volcano ceases and there comes a vari
able period of repose, until a renewal of
the same phenomena brings on another
eruption.
Now if the well-boring genius shall
sink a pipe down to a point that will tap
the internal steam forces, why should he
not perform the magnificent 'dual service

WRECK OF THE BLAIRMORE
A Court of Inquiry to Meet
Thursday at the British
Consulate.
Bids for the Raising of the Sunken
Ship Will Be Opened To-Morrow
at Noon.
The capsizing of the British ship Blair
more was the one absorbing topic of con
versation on the water front yesterday.
Men speculated as to the why and the
wherefore, and the women pitied the
wives and children and relatives of the
dead sailors. All expressed their opinion
about the catastrophe, and while some
blamed Captain Caw others thought he was
blameless, inasmuch as he was only fol
lowing the rules laid down by his owners.
The only manner in which the facts can
be arrived at is by a board of inquiry.
This the British Consul has ordered,
and it -will sit next Thursday at 10 ,\. m.
It will be composed of Wellesley Moore,
British Consul ; Captain Harvey, a retired
British master, and Captain England of
the British ship Thistle, now in port. All
the survivors of the disaster will be called
as witnesses, and the olJioers and crew on
the British Yeoman will also be heard
from, and their evidence will determine
the verdict.
The question of raising the sunken ship
is now under discussion. Bids have been
called for and will be opened to-morrow.
It is a question of no success no pay, and
if the Blairmore is not raised the contrac
tor will be out and injured on the proposi
tion. The chances are that Whitelaw, the
wrecker, will secure the job, and if lie does
the manner in which he will go to work
will be very simple. The hole cut in the
side of the sunken vessel, l>y the work
men of the Union Iron Works will be
patched up and then divers will cut away
the masts and batten down the hatches.
The hull will then be pumped out and
afterward rilled with air. Then if expecta
tions are realized the vessel will come to
the surface of her own volition. This was
the course pursued in the case of the Earl
ot Dalhousie, and as it proved a success
thn chances are that it will be followed
again. The bids will be opened to-mor
row and it remains to be seen who will do
the work.
In spite of the fact that very little of the
unfortunate ship can be seen except at
dead low water quite a number of excur
sion steamers will run out to her to-day.
The Caroline will make hourly trips from
Mission -street wharf and the Ethel and
Marion and the Millie will run from Clay
street. All three are sure to carry crowds,
as the chance of seem? the tomb of the six
imprisoned sailors will be a drawing cam.
As soon as the bodies are recovered the
British shipmasters will take charge of
them and the funeral will bo under tneir
auspices.

San Francisco's first electric railroad,
built by Behrend Joost about six years
ago, and known as the San Francisco and
Ban Mateo Railroad, changed hands yes
terday at noon.
It was sold at the instance of a judg
ment creditor, and was purchased by John
A. Buck and Nicholas Ohlandt for $300,-
The sale took place at the Larkin-street
entrance of the City Hail b.v Receiver
Sanford Bennett, in virtue of a judgment
rendered by Superior Judge Seawell, Feb
ruary tt last, on a foreclosure of mortgage
for the unpaid interest of borrowed capital
amounting to $1,100,000, the bonds of
which were held in trust by the California
Title Insurance and Trust Company.
At precisely 11* o'clock, Receiver Bennett
proceeded to read his authority for offer
ing the road, plant aud rolling stock for
sale, after whicti he called for bids.
The lirst off<T came from A. F. Morri
son, representing Buck & Ohlandt, and
the sum named was $'200,000.
"Two hundred and five," said C. C. But
ler, and the bids ran up $. % .000 at a time till
Morrison bid $2i 10,000.
Mr. Butler raised it $1000 and it went
$100 at a bid till $:2rÂ«;,000 was reached.
Butler then raised it $500 and it vent up
at that rate till Morrison bid $;500.000.
"Take Mr. Morrison's check," said But
ler.
Bennett tried in vain to pet another bid,
but it was finally knocked down to Mr.
Morrison for s3oo,ooo. He announced that
Buck it Qniandt were the purchasers.
This road, notwithstanding the difficul
ties it had to contend with in the shape
of bad management, h:ts been a paying
line. It cleared 6ft an average ?4OUO a
month after paying all the running ex
penses. Its total indebtedness up to the
present time i* about $1,500,000. This is
tho amount which would be necessary to
redeem the bonds upon their face value,
but from the manner in which the bonds
were issued to the S. S. Construction Com
pany at the time that C. C. Butler came to
the rescue of Joost with coin for the com
plesion of the road after the construction
had progressed to a certain point from
where Joost could not extricate himself
the amount of ready cash was about one
half of the face value ef the, bonds.
Hence it is thought that the losses to the
bondholders will not be quite so great as
if the bonds had been purchased at their
face value, which was $1, 306,0*9 3.

NEW ATHLETIC GROUNDS.
Work on the Presidio Recreation Park
to Be Commenced Monday.
Work on the new athletic park, com
prising what was formerly two squares
fronting on Baker street, between Fran
cisco and North Point, is to be commenced
to-morrow. The grounds have been leased
for live years from the Fair estate by the
Presidio and Ferries Company, and ar
rangements have been made for an ideal
place for all outdoor sports. In further
ance of this design William E. Rockwell,
late manager of the Haight-street recrea
tion grounds, bas been appointed manager.
The park will contain a first-class bicycle
track, a cinder path, an immense grand
stand with special provision for training
quarters and all similar requisitas. As
soon as the grounds are in condition,
which will be about the first of June, it is
understood the Olympic Club will use it
as its regular training grounds in lieu of
its present grounds at the old Haight
street park. The football teams are also
taking an interest in the grounds, and
they will be constructed with a view to
their needs. William Kennedy of the
Olympic Club has been lending valuable
assistance in helping the directors of the
road to plan a park that will meet the
favor of athletes.
Big Attractions at Halght Street.
If the weather is propitious this afternoon
and evening, the log-rolling contest and exhi
bitions announced for last, Sunday will be
given at the chutes. The entertainments
offered are a distinct novelty to San Francisco
and the lumbermen, Morris Hern-j and Daniel
Kirby, who will manipulate the piles, are ex
perts in their business.
Just after tae band gets through playing in
the park, patrons of that big breathing-place
rany drop in at the chutes and see the big
balloon inflated, if the wind is not too high,
and the nscension and parachute drop by Emil
Markeberg.
The Supreme Court of New York has

HE CAN HANDLE THE BOW.
Frederick Helms Claims He Is
the Oldest Fiddler in the
Country.
He Is 86 Years of Age, and Has Been
Compelled to Seek Shelter in
the Almshouse.
Frederick Helms, who claims he is the
oldest violin player in the United States,
is in the City Prison waiting bis transpor
tation to the Almsbouse to-morrow.
He and his wife had been Jiving in a
lodging-house on Washington and Drumm
streets, but as they were in arrears for the
rent of their room the landlord made them
leave yesterday afternoon. They got an
expressman and with their little belong
ings they drove out to the City Hall to
take the van to the Almshouse. but it had
gone, so ttiey went to the City Prison.
While the old man was in trie prison
his wife made an excuse that she wanted
to see the expressman, and when she got
outside she ran westward on McAllister
street ana that was the last seen of her.
Helms says he is 86 years of age next
September. He wa9 born in Hanover,
Germany, and came to this country 68
years ago. He went into the show busi
ness and traveled throughout the country
with the 'Topper's Ghost," "Missing
Link" and other illusions. He made
money but lost it all and blames his two
surviving daughters by his first wife for
all his troubles. Both are married and
one of them is living in Bakersfield and
the other somewhere in Oregon.
On being asked if 1113 daughters would
not support him in his old ace he shoo*
his head and said, "they are no good; I
needn't expect any help from them."
For some years the old man has sup
ported himself and wife by playing the
violin in saloons and dives oil the Barbary
Coast. Business became so dull that he
could not make enough to pay his rent
and procure food for himself and wife, and
the Almshouse was their only hope.
One of his precious possessions is his
violin, and he was never tired last night of
showing how cleverly he could handle the
bow, although close on 90 years of age.
He does not think his wife "has deserted
him, but believes she will turn up at the
prison all right. She was his second wife
and they were married sixteen years ago.
She is 60 years of age.

CALIFORNIA INTERESTS.
While under ordinary conditions " a
Presidential campaign does not really
begin until after the nominations have
been made by the two great parties, it is
evident that the contest of this year will
be an exception to the rule. The struggle
will be virtually settled by the convention
at St. Louis. Whoever is nominated
there will be almost certainly the next
I'resident of the United States. The
real camDaign of the year therefore
is that which is now being waged for suc
cess in the Republican convention. A
clear understanding of all that is involved
in this condition of affairs is of vital im
portance to the people of California, for
the State has great interests at stake in
the campaign, and if they are to be pro
vided for at all the work must be done at
St. Louis.
How we can best obtain all that the in
terests of California and the Pacific Coast
require cannot be answered in general
terms. The policy to be pursued will ne
cessarily depend tipon developments at the
St. Louis convention. Senator l'orkins, who
surveys the field from the vantage ground
of his high position at Washington,
paid in an interview published in The Call
yesterday that with a proper unpledged
delegation at the convention he was con
fident it would be possible for California
to "dictate the selection of a Cabinet offi
cer." This would give us a representative
and champion of the IStata and the Coast
in the highest branch of the Government
and would jro far to advance and promote
every interest wÂ« may have that requires
the fosterin.' care of the Nation.
Certainly it is time for Californians to
begin to look out for California. The poli
cies of the Republican party are always
National in their scope, but very naturally
the leaders of the party at Washington
cannot know what is required by the vari
ous sections of the Union unless the men
of each section mace their wishes known.
This is what we must do now. Un
less Californians stand for California,
who will? It is useless for us to
expect of others that which we will not do
for ourselves. The duty of California Re
publicans at this juncture is, therefore,
plain. They must send to St. Louis a
delegation not merely to nominate a can
didate for President, but to see that the
interests of California have a rightful re
cocnition anion? all those other interests
whose combination makes up the welfare
of the great Republic.
A OAKNIVAL PREPARATION.
San Jose has put in'o successful opera
tion a novel and ingenious plan to assure
a bountiful supply of flowers for its great
rose carnival in May. It has been the
general custom heretofore to depend on
private gardens, which in all the cities of
California except San Francisco are able to
yield all the flowers required for carnival
uses. It is evident, however, that the
glow of the gardens is thus reduced at the
very time when it should b3 greatest. On
these occasions thousands of strangers
make their appearance, and it is advisable
that the beauty of the private grounds
should remain unimpaired.
San Jose adopted the plan of making
special provision for the enormous quan
tities of flowers needed for the approach
ing festival. This it did by selecting land
outside the city and planting it to flowers.
The work was placed under the charge of
a competent and public-spirited citizen,
who was supplied with funds. He planted
just the varieties of flowers most needed,
such as sweet peas, marigolds and roses,
and in the case of the annuals made plant
ings of a few days apart so as to secure a
constant supply of fresh flowers through
out the carnival.
Doubtless the selection of roses and
herbaceous plants made was made with a
view to the time and period of bloom of
different varieties. Of course all this costs
money, but it is evident that the results
must be far more satisfactory than those
depending on contributions from private
gardens. Under this arrangement we may
expect the San Jose carnival to make a
display of flowers richer, more abundant
and more gorgeous than has ever been
seen.
Good effects of the carnival spirit are a
pearingat San .lose. As it would be i
advised for visitors to find any streets in a
neglected condition the thoroughfares are
being put in perfect order. Such improve
ments, of course, have a permanent value.
The activity of the people is manifesting
itself in many other way?. Private gar
dens are being placed in the best order,
houses are receiving new paint and the
"Garden City" is generally receiving a
complete renovation. This is likewise the
result in the other cities in which carni
vals are to be held. Every citizen be
comes inspired with a desire to make his
city as atiractive as possible, and realizes
that concentration of effort on a public
spectacle to the neglect of the details
which make a city attractive in the ab
sence of such a show would negative the
benefits to be expected from a largo incur
sion of sightseers.
LOVEBS OP PLEASURE.
One cannot visit the improvements
which Mr. Sutro is rapidly completing in
the vicinity of the Cliff House without
marveling that an investment of millions
of dollars in one spot merely for the en
joyment of pleasure-lovers can be expected
to prove profitable in a comparatively
small city. Among these improvements
are a splendid structure taking the place
of the old Cliff House, the largest and
costliest baths in the world, a sumptuous
garden of generous extent and a curious
"Midway Plaisance," with its fantastic
shows. Mr. Sutro. not satisfied with all
this, has built a fine electric road for better
convenience in reaching them, maintains
at the baths a band and museum and
expert swimmers and divers for the edifica
tion of visitors, and now proposes to erect
on the rocks overhanging the surf one of
the finest hotels in the West. >*o other
city in the country except New York, with
its Coney Island adjunct, has anything
like such a pleasure resort. There is a
vital difference of tone between the two
places, and it is altogether in favor of San
Francisco.
But the resorts for wholesome pleasure
by no means cease at the Cliff House.
Golden Gate Park probably has ten times as
many visitors. The free concerts attract
many thousands and are listened to with
a perfectly subdued, orderly and intelli
gent appreciation. Drivers, riders, bicy
clists and pedestrians throng the many
miles of roads and waiks threading the
reservation and enjoy the wonderful
flowers, the zoological collections and the
aviary. The park is the essence of re
finement ond wholesome pleasure.
Everywhere about the City are pleasure
resorts. The military reservations, the
shooting ranges and picnic gardens at Har
bor View, the salt water swimming baths
in the heart of the City, the two admirably
conducted trotting parks, the numerouj
handsome theaters whose constant pros
perity has given San Francisco the reputa
tion of being a "great show town,' 1 the
cable and electric roads penetrating pic
turesque sections of the City, the numer
ous suburban iesidence and pleasure re
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, BTTNDAY, APRIL 12, 1896.
sorts â all these have their crowds, and the
wonder is when the people find time for
conducting the serious affairs of life.
The interesting part of it all is that these
pleasures are all clean and helpful. In no
sense are they the expression of an idle
and frivolous disposition or an inclination
to indulge in demoralizing dissipations.
Nor can they be explained on the sole
ground that a pleasant climate lurea the
people on occasion from their homes. The
most rational view of the matter is that
complex agenfiies produce a result so un
common in humdrum American life. In
the first place we have a large foreign
population gathered from all the corners
of the earth, bringing with them as an
example and inspiration the customs in
bred in their lives. Again, a people must
be measurably light-hearted in order to
enjoy healthy pleasure, and this it can
not be if it is bound close to the earth by
harsh necessities in the earning of a liveli
hood ; from this we may infer that our
people are prosperous. Further, the
climate is so invigorating and so perfectly
conserves instead of draining those vital
forces without which healthy existence is
impossible, that it seems necessary we
should expend ihe surplus energy in the
pursuit of rational pleasures. It is a happy
circumstance that climatic conditions
which create such a desire present perfect
conditions for its gratification.
It is not surprising that with so fortunate
a co-operation of agencies producing a
desire for pleasure there should come vast
expenditures of capital and enercy in the
creation of pleasure resorts. In this re
spect as in many others, San Francisco is
unique, enjoying on that account a dis
tinction which is becoming a special fame,
and which under a judicious direction of
public spirit can be made one of the surest
foundations upon which to rest the coming
greatness of the City.
UNFAIR SUBSTITUTION.
Considerable complaint is being made at
the present time that with the growth in
public favor of an article of more than
usual merit has come a practice which, if
not actually dishonest, is certainly dis
honorable and unfair.
We rofer to the practice of substituting
â not the outright act of replacing the
original article by an inferior or cheaper
product under the cover or wrapper or in
the bottle of the more esteemed com
modity, but to a substitution not less
culpable, when the matter is fairly viewed.
In expending time, intelligence and
money in bringing his poods into demand
and giving them a prestige, the concocter
of a patent medicine, the man who pro
duces a certain brand of flour or the man
who puts on the market a soap of peculiar
qualities is not furthering his own interests
alone by achieving distinction lor this
product, but is directly benefiting every
person who handles his goods, by having
created a ready market tor them. A great
injustice iÂ«, therefore, imposed on the
originator and manufacturer of such goods
when the retail merchant induces a cus
tomer to purchase something "just as
good" as the article which, by reason of
the prestige it has gained by virtue of its
actual merit, the customer has a<ked for.
The manufacturer of the remedy, flour
or soap called for is just as much entitle i
to all the benefits of the market he has
created by his energy and ability as he is
to the money for which he sells his goods,
and the retailer who inducss a customer
to purchase something else than the stan
dard article requestci is clearly depriving :
the manufacturer of justly due profit fiom
the sale. The storekeeper is also in nine
cases out of ten foisting upnn the pur
chaser something inferior in order that he
may make a few cents additional profit.
Both dealer and purchaser owe it to the
manufacturer to see that the latter is
treated fairly, and the purchaser also owes
it to himself that this is done. The dealer
should strictly eschew the practice of sub
stituting described, and the consumer
should invariably insist on having what
he originally intended to buy.
DANGEROUS GROUND.
Psychical research has become very
much of a fashionable cult since London
and Boston formed societies for the str.dy
of the philosophy of psychology, which is
all well enough no doubt as to object and
purpose, but the way some amateurs play
with occult forces is enough to make one
shudder. Investigators should know that
psychic phenomena are as dangerous as
they are fascinating, and that one should
not blindly try to fathom their secrets any
more than he would plunge alone and un
armed into the depths of a forest where
wild beasts and poisonous snakes make
their home.
It is no secret that the psychic realm
begins in the borderland between spirit
and matter; where these two great mani
festations of cause overlap and mingle,
and that the line which actually separates
them is ob.'cure and uncertain. Upon this
side lie things which we sen^eand analyze
by touch, taste, sight, smell and hearing.
Upon the other side lies the boundless
world of spirit entities â a world in whose
astral light and darkness are occult forces
mighty for good and evil, and with which
we can have to do only upon a plan of ex
istence wi ere our five physical senses are
entirely foreign and of no more avail than
if they were not at all.
It is a fact that the product of the em
ployment of occult forces in conjunction
with the soul of man, wlien his soul is en
vironed by a physical body, is either white
or black magic, and that the influence
they exert upon the soul as well as upon
the body fÂ»r weal or for woe is almost be
yond estimate. These forces work alto
gether in currents that are in harmony
with their own purpose. They are cur
rents of love, of hatred or of indifference,
and the agencies they employ are thought
transference, clairvoyance, mesmerism,
hypnotism and mental agitation.
The difference between white and black
magic is in consequence only ; and since con
sequence may not follow until after a long
time has elapsed, the importance of know
ing which current of this mighty force is
being stirred is apparent. There ia a vast
deal more danger to the soul in penetrat
ing the astral world withort a c! art of its
paths than there would be to the physical
body in wandering through the slums of
San Francisco at midnight with no pro
tection. The hypnotic power of a spirit
out of the body is infinitely greater than
that of one in the body; besides, there is
the added advantage of being ur.sten,
which the disembodied spirit possesses.
When au unseen intelligence gets con
trol of a person the subject is said to be
in a "trance." When the same result is
secured by one in the body we say the sub
ject is hypnotized, but the process is pre
cisely the same, as is also the mental con
dition of the subject. Thought transfer
ence between two minds in physical bodies
is by exactly the same law of mental ac
tion that would enable two disembodied
spirits to converse one with the other, or
permit an embodied spirit and one freed
from physical environment to hold con
versation. It follows, therefore, that the
individual who fully surrenders his mind
to occult forces and influences, whether
they emanate wholly from the astral world,
wholly from the physical world or from
au intermingling of the two, is the servant
of those forces, and that his conduct and
thoughts while under such control will be
in harmony with the purpose, the wish,
the will and the desire of those forces,
whether they be for good or evil. Herein
lies the danger, in part at least, of the
"seance," '-sitting for development," "ex
perimenting for fun" and kindred spiritual
phenomena that are obtained haphazard.
The true philosophy of psychology is,
however, a healthy study and highly in
structive phenomena may be had in con
nection with it, but not with entire safety
except upon cold and exacting lines of in
vestigation where the rules of analysis are
severely correct and where the student is
more or less skeptical. Unless phenomena
can withstand the severest tests a danger
ous mistake is made in accepting them as
of good report. But when a psychical
phenomenon is run down to as near its last
analysis as possible the acquaintance one
then has with it deprives it of practically
all danger.
The young student of occult science
should not be long in discovering that his
imagination goes flying around three men
tal centers, viz.: the inventive, the ideal
istic and the sympathetic, all of which are
dangerous ground unless he allows the
full play of his better judgment, when he
will be strong and comparatively sure of
his footing. Then he may cut loose from
his moorings and go deep into the cause
and effect of psychical mysteries. Perhaps
the greatest danger that confronts the stu
dent is in inclination to spend too many
continuous hours in exploration, because
unless he withdraws from the field before
he is entirely overcome by the fascination
of "things revealed " he is almost certain
to degenerate in physical strength, in
moral tone and in mental discernment.
The trouble with many students of occult
phenomena is that they persist in trying
to accomplish in a few months or a year
as much as they should hope to secure in
a quarter of a century of cautious and
painstaking investigation. And, again,
the student makes a grave if not a fatal
mistake if he thinks the physical man can
not be torn and wrenched while his mind
is reaching out into (to him) the unknown.

OBSERVATIONS AND REFLECTIONS.
What havoc historical research is
making of our childhood's idols ! The dis
covery that there is not any "truly" Santa
Claus is only the beginning of an image
breaking that strews the pathways of life
with incessant wreckage. "William Tell
and the apple, Pocahontas and the saving
of Captain John Smith have been laid
away in their oblivious graves, to the deso
lation of millions of hearts; but child
hood's latest and most poignant grief is
because of Mr. William M. Sloane's fatal
demolition of Empress Josephine. To
think that this lovely woman, deserted
and left all forlorn while yet beautiful, and
whose sweet mission it was to soften the
rigors of the marble-hearted man of des
tiny, was no better tnan she ought to have
been! In fact, not nearly bo good. It is
crushing. What a paragon of virtue, love
liness and constancy the old historians
pictured her. That she was beautiful and
intellectually bright is still true, but, alas!
she was as bad as beautiful and altogether
unworthy the admiration of any child.
Those little, red-covered biographies of
the great and good ! "What child has not
reveled in them and blessed the name of
Abbott as he read? And yet all the he
roes of all the Abbotts were heroic with
the same dead level of mugwunipish im
partiality, and made equally worthy of
youthml emulation, though at the cost of
entire disregard of historic verity. It were
better so. Children can safely be initiated
into a knowledge of the good and the
beautiful, but not the true. Only those
can bear that who have come to the years
of discretion, have suffered ihe smashing
of their idols and have survived. The Ab
botts, in falsifying history for childhood's
sake, did nobiy, and it is encouraging to
know that they made a great deal of
money by their righteous sinning. If
t-ood did not so often result from evil,
would there be so very much good in the
world?
My boyâ for I like to talk to the boys
once in a whileâ read every scrap of relia
ble history or anecdote about Lincoln that
conies in your Avay. Once interested in
the story of his life you will never weary
of it. He was not a demi-god like Ulysses
or Hector, Achilles or Agamemnon, but he
was better than these, for he was a flesh
and blcod American, the perfected product
of the best that is in American n.anhood.
Homely, wise, kind, patient, brave, not
too good for a frolic, he was of all men just
the man to be a boy's hero. It seems al
most that God, in his providence, had kept
the Lincoln family imDoverished of manly
qualities for more than a hundred years in
order to save up those elements of great
ness which belonged by right to three suc
cessive generations and make them avail
able at a time of supreme national need.
Read all you can about Lincoln, for if you
do there will come to be within that Par
thenon of ideals which every man carries
in his heart a rugged model of American
manliness, a living image and daily helper
in your work of character building which
will tend to make you an Abraham Lin
coln kind of a man.
Speaking of broken images reminds me
of another hoax â the slepping beauty.
Beauty is beauty no longer when she
sleeps. Artists have painted and sculptors
have carved sleeping beauties that were
beautiful, but they were not sleeping, but
only posing. In sleep the chin drops, the
eyelids thut like cellar-doors and all licht
and life goes out of the face, leaving it as
if cast in the ugly mold of death. Why,
the greatest beauty that ever was would
set the dogs to howling if th^y came upon
her while asleep. Only babies are pretty
when they sleep, and most babies are
pretty only when they sleep.
I have amused myself by making some
private statistical observations in relation
to the attendance of men and women at
houses of worship and places of recreation,
and I find at houses of worship the ratio of
attendance of women to men is about five
to one; and that at places of amusement
of the better sort the ratio of men to
women is about one and a half to one, the
half of a man having the best seat for pur
poses of observation and applauding most
immoderately whenever remarkable agility
is manifested on the stage.
Humanity is easily amused and the
simplest things are the most amusing. The
best impersonations are sometimes but
tamely applauded, while a whistler is ap
plauded again and again. I have seen a
good quartet retire behind the scenes with
out an encore, and ten minutos later a
human jumping-jack turn himself into a
daddy-longlegs and straddle off the stage
amid deafening applause. While the
Keenest witticisms are provoking smiles, a
man at the other end of the stage who pos
sesses no element of attractiveness except
a mouth like a catfish, and who does noth
ing at all but make faces, has his unnatural
contortions rewarded with roars of laugh
ter. This is true, as every theater-goer
knows, but it does not prove degeneracy
of the human race, anthropoidal ancesiry
or anything of that sort. It is just only
true and that is all there is of it.
There was a visitor in the City a little
while ago whose coming and going were
worthy of note, but were not noted. Bhe
is over 80 years old, reared sons to 'lie for
a country she had seen little of and daugh
ters to pick lint for thosa who had gone to
war; but they were ail dead â her husband
was dead â and now she is going about to say
good morning and good evening to a coun
try she has a thousand reasons for hold
ing dear. A stout young neighbor accom
panies her wherever she goes, and she has
been going most of the time for a year or
twoâ traveling by easy stages, spending a
week here and there and a month else
where, that she may rest up before con
tinuing on her patriotic pilgrimages. Last
winter she spent in Southern California,
the winter before in the South, the sum
mers where it is cool, and a few months
now and again in her Ohio home for addi
tional resting. She is a tireless observer,
net at all afraid of strangers or timid in
astdng about the things she wants to know
about, and she enjoys every new scene or
object of interest with all the zest of a
bride upon her weuding tour. "It has
been tke desire of ruy life," she said, "to
know my own country, and if theie i 3
time I mean to know it before I go to that
other country where my friends have
gone." While her loved ones lived there
was always some one to do for and her
longed-for sight-seeing had to wait â wait
until she was SO; but as "all things come
to those who wait," the opportunity to see
her country came at last to her.
Somehow when I read of the death of
the Booth-Tucker baby away in its Eng
lish home I was possessed of "mingled
feelings," as gentlemen say when they rise
to make acknowledgments. It was not
six weeks old when its mother lett it to
cross the Atlantic and assume command
of American forces embattled against sin.
It was ailing and died. Mrs. Booth-Tucker
must be a Spartan mother, or a very philo
sophical one, or so profoundly in earnest
io the Salvation cause as to be willing to
make all sacrifices for it; or else she must
be wanting in that quality of motherhood
which gave to the world its first glimmer
ing sense of the passion of love. I shall
bestow neither praise nor blame, but the
incident assures us that Mrs. Booth-
Tucker is quite a remarkable woman.
I once had for a friend a brave Scotch
man who hailed from some secluded
Drumfoehty and he so regaled me with
etories of his home and youth that I loved
Scotland for his sake as well as for the
sakes of Scott and Burns, and in remem
brance of him I have eaten some sort of
"porritch" ever since. He walked twelve
miJes from his work and home again to
fetch me a dozen oranses when I was con
valescing; but with all his kindliness and
general buoyancy of spirit he had occa
sional relapses into melancholy. In one
of these he concluded to Jeave the world,
and, what was worse, to take a much-loved
companion with him. He made a muss of
it blowing her brains over most every
thing else. His digestion had become im
paired.
If the reader will observe as he jogs
through life he will discover that no man
with a full stomach ever commits suicide,
and that no man who has a good appetite
and anything hk^ a reasonable certitude
of having that appetite gratiried departs
this life voluntarily. It is the man who
cannot eat with satisfaction or digest his
food with comfort who finds in the world
nothing but blackmailing schemes, dis
honesty, monopoly, disaster, destitution,
disease and death by his own insane de
vices. Those old fogies who thought the
spleen the seat of melancholy were mis
taken. It is the stomach. To live to eat
may be ignoble, but to so live that one
may eat is the sum of worldly wisdom.
Why will a man, otherwise sane, carry
a large amount of life insurance all his
ctays with the view of providing money for
his wife after he has gone and yet scarcely
give her a cent she can call her own all
the time he persists to live?

A WAIST FOR TWO FABRICS.
The lady's waist shown here is one of the
newest moaels. To be made of two fabrics the
skirt worn should be one of the fabrics. It is
cut with a fitted lining, over which the ma
terial is placed. Over this again is the plas
tron piece, both back and front, of a contrast
ing color or a different fabric.
An imported gown after this model was of
brown cloth. The sleeves and underwaist w*rÂ«
of green silk with stripes of brown and dull
blue, forming a plaid. The cloth was used ;in
tiie wnist only for the plastron portion.
A handsome crepon of blue and green mix

to match the skirt. The uriderwalst was of a

fabrics in waists, and even in skirts. Most
brilliant combinations result, and almost any
color scheme is allowable.

S BARING-GOULD'S new novel,
"The Broom-Squire," is a sad,
realistic story of peasant life in
O the southern part of England.
It holds Interest to the end, and
it is not one of the stories of which the out
come is readily predicted from a perusal
of a few opening chapters. Jonas Kink,
the Broom-Squire, is a bachelor who pos
sesses a small e.-tatc- in the broom region
between London and Portsmouth, and of
whom the only good word people ever
said was that he was thrifty. The heroine
of the story, afterward known as Mehita
bel. was a waif, found as an infant near the
body of her murdered lather by Joras
Kirk and Iver Virstage, son of "a village
iniKeeper. All that was known of the
was th;u her lather had carried her

THE WRONG MAN.
In Dorothea Gerard's new book, just
issuci in the Town and Country Library,
iwn bow it is the fate of some men
never to be in the right place. "The
Wrong Man" opens with a duel between
.Ster<an Milnovies and Alfred Kadford,
both officers in the Austrian army.
Through misconception Milnovies re
sponds to a challenge from Radford.
ttepan is wounded in the encounter, and
he then discovers that Radford, far from
seeking the duel on the score that was
imagined, had demanded satisfaction
really on account of some slurring re
mark?, the use of whirh Milnovics now
hastened ,to deny. Radford traces them
to their source and rinds that Stejan had
been misrepresented by a revengeful
woman. The wounded man leaves" the
army. He falls in love anJ is on the
point of marryinp. At t lds juncture Rad
ford comes in and ieeks to help Stepan
in his suit by bestowal of praise, when the
girl falls in love with Radforri, and again
fate deals Miinovic? a blow. To his double
sorrow he was the wrong man in two
cases. But Radford is a noble fellow and
his actions win Btepan'a respect as well
as the love of Stepan's old girl. [New

THK SNOW". Of YKSTER YEAR.
This story, by Wilbertine Teters, is built
upon ideas that border on the thÂ»o<?ophi
cal. It is a peculiar story and life goes
through it with the hue of death on liis
cheeks. The scene is at a Colorado health
resort, where a brilliant woman who had
once charmed the crowned heads of
Esrope with the magic of her voice is
flov.lv wasting away with consumption.
Her fame had been in her voice and her
voice had been all she cared for. When
that was taken away, she thought she
wanted to die, and yet the long r she
lived the more she clung to life. She had
n<-ver intended to marry ; yet she had mar
ried and her husband had taken her de
spite the apparent disadvantages of such
a union. 'Ihis woman, known as ''The
M I ...:ne,'' whobelieves that God is nature,
exercises a power over the iife of a beauti
ful and intellectual girl, "Norwista" â a
power that wrars away the girl's religious
belief- like the imperceptible washing of
constant waters against a not too firm bar
rier. Norwista is led to look at tilings
from the inadame's stand) oint. A love
story of a rather :-piritual kind runs through
the volume. The madame asserts that,
in comparison with her Ego, her body
is as nothing to hÂ«Â»r, and the launches
forth this view of marriage: "A man and
a woman whose temperaments are in per
fect accord meet and love each other, but
because there happens to be some disease
back in one of the families they go differ
ent ways, perhaps to live lives "of terrible
diÂ«cord with others. And for what? The
physical per.ection of fatare generations.
Thus did the decadence of the Greeks be
gin. We do not think of the mental liar
mony to be transmitted. Psychical con- !
ditions of more power than we realize, i
spiritual al'itndes attained only through
suffering and des^iir, unknown to the ,
healthy animal, do we barter for the ma- .
terial." Mr. Halcourt is a guest in the
same household with the madar.ie, and he j
is dying with consumption also. He is ;
young and single, and a man of talent and j
refinement, but he knows that his battle of !
life is nearly dor.c and that oblivion will !
shortly swallow him. He laughs away
all hope and is happy because there
is nothins to bind his love to life, j
Now, Norwista longs to love and be
lovedâ to have an ideal husband. She
is brought into ilalcourt's sphere, and i
they are attracted to each other >
from the moment their eyes meet. On !
the brink of the grave Halcourt yields, |
even against his own reason, to the lovo ,
that tor the first time rushes into his soul,
and Nbrwista's soul responds to his. At
this .supreme moment he breathes his last.
Then, in her loneliness, Norwista has no
belief to console her, and she is bewailing I
the emptiness of life, when the dying
madame confesses her errors and begs
Norwista to return and cling to her relig
ious ideals. [Boston, Ma-s.; Arena Pub

THK HISTOKY OF THE DECLINE AND
FALL OF THK ROMAN EMPIISE.
A new edition of Gibbon's celebrated j
work has just been published in thiscoun
try by Messrs. Macmiilan & Co. of New
York. It is to be completed in seven
volumes, under the editorship of J. B.
Bury, M.A., professor of modern history
in the University of Dublin.
Under date of February 1, 1T76, Edward
Gibbon wrote diffidently of his labors:
"1 have ventured, perhaps too hastily, to
commit to the press a work which, in every
sense of the word, lieserves the epithet of
imperfect." And again: "I dare not pre
sume to give any assurances (regarding its
final completion).
"The execution of the extensive plan
which I have described would connect the
ancient and modern history of the world;
but it would require many years of health,
of leisure and or perseverance."
That Gibbon was spared to complete his
self-apportionedtask is a matter for which
ali students of history are deeply grateful.
Piofessor Bury, the editor of the present
edition, contributes alensthy introduction.
He comments on the fact that Gibbon is
equally well regarded both in the history
oi literature and as a great historian ; and
that Gibbon's work has not gone the way
of Hume and Robertson, "whom we laud
as 'classics' and leave on the cold shelves."
This, the editor opines, ''is due to the
singularly happy union of the historian
and the man of letters."
From careful observation Professor
Bury submits many illustrations of the al
most painful care and attention given by
Gibbon to styie. Particularly is this no
ticeable in parts of the first and second
editions. There are also cases where some
thing is added, in the second edition,
which, without changing tne general
sense, renders a statement fuller, more
picturesque or more vivid.
The editor of the present work ventures
the opinion that if Gibbon were alive and
writing at the present <iay his history
would be very different. This may or may
not be so, but it is certainly quite reason
able to suppose that if he were writing at
the present day t.is attitude toward the '
Christian church would be greeted with
nuich less of opposition than it encoun
tered at the bands of Dean Miiman. [New

IN THE BME PIKE.
This, the latest work of that master
of fiction, Georee Ebers, is well worth read
ing. It is called a romance dealing witn
German civilization of the sixteenth cen
tury, ana the scene is laid in Nuremberg,
that quaint old town tr.at has furnished ]
picturesque material to Ouida, as well as '
to other English writers.
"The Blue Pike" is an old inn in the
German city, at which, in the opening
chapters of the book, sundry savants and
scholars are assembled. Among these is
one Licnhard Groland. This man be
friends a poor ropewalicer or acrobat dar
ing his tenure of a magisterial position. ]
The circumstances under which Groland i
acts the part of a friend to Kuni, the j
acrobat, are peculiar. She is in a crowd of !
people who are watching a wedding Dro- |
cession, and is impressed with the noble j
bearing of the bridegroom, Groland. She |
picks up a jeweled rosary dropped by one I
of the crowd, is arrested and brought be
fore the benedict of yesterday and his
colleagues.
Groland intercedes in her behalf, secures
her release, and obtains for her the posi
tion of domestic in the louse of a good
natured German woman. Disliking the
life she goes back to her former occupa
tion, that of a strolling p layer.
But Groland's kindness to her has won i
the heart of Kuni. His image is con- j
stantly before herâ sometimes alone, some
times with that of his bride, whom she !
envies. For his wife she conceives a feel- !
ing akin to hatred, and some time after
ward the strolling troupe of which Kuni |
is a member is engaged to perform before
the Emperor Maximilian.
While preparing to go upon the tight!
â¢wire Kuni observes Groland in the audi- I
ence. She is immediately fired with an
ambition to perform feats deemed almost
impostibie of performance. She is greeted |
with the wildest applause from tiie vast
audience assembled below. Suddenly she
looks down and sees that her hero is not
regarding her with that attention she !
thinks is her cue. A feeling oi jealousy I
seizes her. She feels stimulated to per" i
form still more difficult feats, in the midst
of one of which she falls to the ground
maimed for life.
The story is cleverly and powerfnlly I
told. The love of tho poor acrobat, for her '
magisterial benefactor, hopeless as it is, is J
prettily described, and the romance will !
doubtless add fame to it? author and
credit to its translator, Mary J. Safford.

GREENLAND ICEFIELDS.
"Greenland Icefields and Life in the
North Atlantic" is the title of a new
volume by G. Frederick Wright, D.D.,
LL.D., author of the "Ice Age in North j
America." and Warren Upharn, A.M., late
of the United States Geological Survey.
In the summer of 1804, Rev. Mr. Wright
made a trip to Greenland along with an
excursion party, on board the steamer
Miranda, and in connection with that
voyage arose the immediate imrmlse to
the preparation of this book. The Miranda
met a series of misfortunes, colliding with
a glacier at one time, and then running on
rocks and suffering damage that forced
crew and passengers to abandon heratsea.
Dr. Wright declares that the varied and '
exciting fortunes of the Miranda, while not <
sufficient to form the framework of the
volume, were still of no small value in i
giving vividness to one's conceptions i
of the unique condition of Greenland,

them "into a more satisfactory general

LL.D. The book is elegantly printed and
attractively bound, and contains maps and
numerous "illustrations. Eight years a^o
the first edition was published, and a sec
ond edition followed, without any change
' in the body of the wont, nine months
later. The "present edition is thoroughly
| revised, and all facts relating to the south
| em part oi the State are brought down tc
, the latest date. In a new preface Dr.
| Lindley refers to the Los Angeles real
. estate boom of 18S6-87, in this manner:
"We did not see it then, but we can see
I it clearly now, that the fall of 1887 marked
j the beginning of the end of that wild era
of speculation, which did much good as
well as evil in pushing forward Los Ange
les and the surrounding country within
three or four years to an extent which
they could not have otherwise reached in
three times that period.
"It was prophesied by many that after
the subsidence of the real estate excite
ment this section would relapse into a
moribund condition. It might have been
] so in any other section of the United
i States, but the marvelous resources of
j Southern California were sufficient not
j only to tide this section over the natural
j reaction from a period of crazy inflation
but to establish it on a path of "still more
remarkable and permanent progre3?."
The census of I*oo gave L,os Angeles a
population of 50,000. Dr. Lindley claims
{ 80,000 to-day. Among the improvements
J of that city noted arÂ« three systems of
electric street railroads, an ocean outfall
and internal sewer system, 100 miles of
| streets graded and paved, buildings to the
value of $20,000,000 erected and a good
commencement made in establishing a
manufacturing industry, to which the dis
\ covery of petroleum within the city limits
j has lent much assistance.
In the country the progress has been
no less remarkable. On every hand
orchards of citrus and deciduous trees
have been planted by thousands upon
thousands of acres. A beet - sugar
{ factory which utilizes the product of
| 5000 acres of land is in successful opera
tion. Boom-cities, which were laid out
merely on a real estate basis â such as Mon
rovia, Whittier, Fullerton and others
have grown to be flourishing, productive
centers of population. Towns which had
scarcely an existence when the rirst edi
tion of" the book was publishedâ such as
Pasadena and Redlands â are now cities
with brick blocks, banks and other appur
tenances of modern business jife. Dr.
Lindley says that it is evident that the
progress of the past ten years in Southern
j California is but an index of that which is
in store for his section. In fact, he might,
with equal truth, have declared the same
thing of California without regard to sec
tion. The volume will be a fine advertise
ment for the southern counties. [New

THJE VOICE AND (SPIRITUAL EDU
CATION,
This is the title of a little book by Hiram
Corson, LLD., professor of English litera
ture in Cornell University. The author de
clares that while it is the purpose of the
work to emphasize the importance of voice
culture in its relations to literary and gen
eral culture it is not its purpose, except
incidentally, to impart elocutionary in
struction. He lays special stress upon the
importance of spiritual education as the
end toward which all education should be
directed and as an indispensable condition
of interpretative reading. "Such educa
tion," saya Mr. Corson, "is demanded for
responding to and assimilating the in
forming life on any product of literary
genius; without it, mere vocal training in
volves little or nothing. By the spiritual
I mean man's essential, absolute being,
and I include in the term the emotional^
the susceptible or impressible, the sympa
thetic, the instinctive, the intuitiveâ in
short the whole domain of the non-intel
lectual, the non-discursive." The volume is

L.AVKNGRO.
The new edition of George Barrow's
''Bible in Spain," published a short time
since, met with a demand that induced the
republication of Barrow's other important
! work, '-Lavengro: the Scholar, the Gypsy
j and the Priest." The latter volume was
i written when the author was in the prime
'of his mental vigor. It bears the charac
: teristics of all his works â "carelessly writ
ten, impatient, petulant, and in parts repel-
I lain, but instinct with character and mood
' and wayward fancy." "Lavengro" did not
meet the success forty years ago that it is
I expected to attain to-dayâ it pleased
I neither the religious nor tbe polite world,
i and yet it is said to have had many pas
sionate admirers. Barrow led a sort of
vagabond existence for years and his ex

SIEGFRIED THK MYSTIC.
There is something weird and uncanny
about this book. Its author, Ida Worden

its relation to wealth, responsible and ir
responsible. The book, like many others

liero, George Martin, is a gentleman who,

even in babyhood, "showed germinal
symptoms of his life's dominating pas
sion," to the joy of his father and diasust
of his mother. When George becomes of
an ago to go to school he rebels, but is
quieted by the assurance that if he does
not devote himself to study he will very
iikely be cheated out of his property.
On arriving at years of discretion the
hero secures a position in a mercantile
concern, at the same time making the
acquaintance of the son of the principal.
This son, Herbert Lord by name, pos
sesses out-of-the-way socialistic ideas
touching the equal division of wealth and
kindred matter?. His theories are not
favorably accepted by his father, who,
after curbing him, dies of apoplexy. Then
appears on the scene Siegfried the Mystic,
who. it appears, is the personage who is
responsible for Herbert's views. Siegfried
is a fanatic with supernatural powers, and
his influence over young men is well pic
tured.
As a piece of writing Siegfried the Mys
tic may be favorably regarded. But it is
difficult to see what purposes are served by
works of this character. They are the pro
ductions of idealists, visionaries and
''dreamers of dreams," and advance ex
ploded notions ami theories impossible of
practical execution.

cinctly sums up England's foreign policy:
Whenever her sovereignty has gone two >
blades of grnss have grown where one grew j
before. Her flag wherever it Las been ad
vanced has benefited the country over wnieh â 
it floats and has carried wiih it civilization,
the Christian religion, order, justice and pros
perity. England has always treated a con
quered race with justice, and what under her ;
rule is the law for the white man is the law !
for his black, red and yellow brother. â¢ * â¢
England would never have told a neighboring
country desiring reciprocal trade relations, as
the United States told Mexico in 1866, "that
to speak of permanent desirable commercial '
relations" with her "is without hope of sue- !
cess or promise of substantial results."
Mayo W. Hazeltine reviews the present

force the Madrid Government to declare
war agninst this country, and that it will
strive to gain the active co-operation of
either France or Germany, hut that the

of either Russia or Eneland, both of which ;

There is some curiosity amonir English
publishers to know whether Dr. Jameson is I
likely to write a book on his experiences '

the necessity of reading a failure in the

philosophy enough to laugh at a bad din

RETROSPECT.
Look bacK a momentâ how they glowed.
That wonderful array oi poppies
Across the lieilÂ»e, hard by thi- road.
A vision of vermilllon I!;ht!
Too suddenly shut out from sight,
By wayside wall and clustering coppice.
Waist high, wild roses held the trees
In tangled passion of embraces;
And by tne pathway, skirting seas
Of hf aving grass or arrowy wheat,
Iris and death-pale meadow sveet
Raised to your fairer face their faces.
I saw you tread that narrow track,
Midway between the grass, and noted
How straight the crowding spears stood back,
Green as those waves which at command
Rose like a wall on either hand
To let God's chosen pass dry-footed.
The year had climbed to mid July
A nd stayed a moment glad and glowing,
To flash aero s the exultant sky â¢
Her white and azure, gold and rosÂ«
Alasâ sadder hues she chose
To hide her desolate out going.
If I should search the o'.d year through,
Krom first to last, I should discover
Headaches and heartaches not a few;
And yet lh;it momentâ flowers and trees,
Sunset and you ! HicgÂ»ve.-iÂ« these,
And for their sake and yoursâ l love her.

J-. âB^^^ Â« -
THE word "New" has been so
much abused lately that one has
come to look upon it with distrust
and suspicionâ the New woman
is always with us>, we have seen
the New problem play, and even the New
man is forging to the front, but the New
ector has for n long time been conspicuous
by his absence. We have had this season
quite a succession of pentlemen who have
reached the meridian of life, and whose
acting of the legitimate, if a little anti
quated in its methods, is not to be sniffed
at. But the end of the century acting â
the art that conceals a rtâ we have not had.
Richard Mansfield is a new actor; he has
his traducers in common with everything
else new, but his devotion to art is ereat
and no doubt consoles him for being fre
quently misunderstood. As an instance
of this devotion, the New York papers have
stated that Mansfield has already mort
gaged the whole proceeds of his Pacific
Coast tour in order to spend i t on the lavish
production of a new play, t lie sum quoted
being $75,000. This is devotion with a ven
geance, for with most artists the pocket is
a tenderer point than the heart. You may
say that Mansfield is lacking in business
foresight, but people said the same of Sir
Henry Irving once. That idol of the Brit
ish publicâ before he was an idolâ came
very near financial shipwreck while trying
to convince his audiences that he Knew
more about the stage than they did. Since
the time of Booth, Mansfield is the only
American actcr who has played on Henry
Irving's stage, the London Lyceum, and
in spite of a few carping critics has won
the respectful consideration of the British
press and public alike.
Distinguished foreigners ?ay that one of
the tirst questions asked them on landing
in this country is, "How do you like us?"
They romment on this as a peculiarity in
the American nation, but the question is
really a very natural one, considering that
many of the distinguished foreigners come
here notebook in hand, resolved, sooner or
later, to give tliH American people "apiece
of their minds." Distinguished opera sing
ers, fiddlers, pianists and actors are gener
ally enticed here in quest of the ereat
American dollar. They are too busy cap- ;
turing it to waste time on notebooks, but '
in their leisure moments even these dis- j
tinguiahed visitors have been showing a j
tendency lately to breuk into print, and I
give startling and gratuitous pieces of
their minds about America and its people
â to say, in fact, the sort of things that if
they were uttered in England, France,
Italy, or almost any other country, would
cause the inhabitants to send the utterers
thereof to Coventry for the rest of their
natural lives.
But the Americans, like charity, suffer
long and are Kind where foreign
Bingers, pianists and actors are con
cerned. On political grounds they
are ever ready to twist the British lion's
tail or tweak the King of Spain's nose, but
in the domain of art the foreign invaders
have discovered loiig ere this that, when
smitten, the Americans turn the other
cheek. There is Paderewski, for instance.
How we have loved him and worshiped
at his shrine. And this is what his friend
and mouthpiece, Htigo Goerlitz, remarks
frankly, for publication in a Cincinnati
newsp aper. as he is getting ready to shake
the dust of America off his feet and depart
for Europe with his pockets full of money :
"The whole press of America is rotten.
America is rotten to the core. We only
come here to make money, and we make
it. We don't care how much abuse we
get from America. We do not give a
for the American press. Mr. PaderewÂ«ki
has never read a line in the newspaper?,
books or magazines published here."
"And is this the bend?" as Miss Sqneers
would have asked, tearfully. Is this the
hend of all our love and devotion? Have
our bouquets, our applause, aye, and our
tears, brought us nothing but this? It is
a plain case of love's labor lost.
We are now confronted by the prob
lem, How shall we be able to please Eie
nora Duse when she comes? Her ways are
us inscrutable as those of Hugo Goerlitz,
and in our blundering good-natured way
we may nauseate her with our flowers, or
applaud too lavishly, and so fail to pro
pitiate her. Chicago has offended Duse.
In some mysterious way it hurt her feel
ings, and she said she would not play in
its yard any more. After much persuasion
fhe consented to reconsider her decision.
And what has Chicago done? It has
made a record for itself by preferring in
dependence to art. Duse's box-orhce has
been left severely alone, and even in^Xew
York, where the public is used to the con
tumely of foreign artists, the Press dares
to say approvingly :
"While publicly reproving Chicago we
continue t r j admire it secretly. That is a
c;ty of spunk, independence and spirit.
When Duse arrived in this country she
declared her contempt for America in
general and Chicaco in particular. We
thought nothing of her uncivil greeting,
for this city is used to such things. Chi
cago lay low and said nothing. But when
Mr. Miner finally persuaded his star to re
consider her determination never to visit
Chicago ajrain our neighbors in the West
had an opportunity to give the actress tit
for tat."
Ueing a two weeks' stand cuts San Fran
cisco off from one of the joys of theater
goingâwe get none of those sterling silver
souvenirs which are being given away
with theater tickets in New York, almost
as freely as presents with pounds of tea.
Belis, inkstand?, pen-holders, every im
aginable device, "all in sterling silver, 1 '
are continually being donated to celebrate
the fiftieth and one hundredth representa
tions, so that if the New York play-goer
times his visits to the various theaters
carefully he can always add to his stock of
souvenirs. The women of the enlightened
West, though, would never have brooked
the leap year souvenirs which were given
away the other day with "A Black Sheep."
They were penknives, and only men re
ceived them. Not a lady â not even a new
womanâ got one, unless her escort saw fit
to give her his.
Baldwin Theater.
Richard Mansfield is generally looked
upon, both at home and abroad, as the
representative American actor, and his
appearance at the Baldwin Theater to
morrow night will, no doubt, piove one of
the most interesting events of the present
theatrical season.
"Beau Brummell" will be the openine I
performance. Mansfield has appeared |
here before in the eccentric, pathetic role j
of the Beau, whose life is one long striving j
after "good form," out his characteriza- !
tion is one of such delicacy and finish that ;
it will bear seeine a second or even a third I
time.
This year Mansfield's associate? are com
posed of his New York Garrick Theater
Stock Company, the leading member be
ing Miss Beatrice Cameron. The company j
also includes Eleanor Carey, Jennie Ens- j
tace, Johnstone Bennett. Nora Lamison, !
Grace Gayior, Charlotte Walker, Harriette i
yon Ganahl, May Lavine, I). H. Harkins,
j E. D. Lyons. Orrin Johnson. A. a. An- j
| drews. W. X. Griflith, Louis Dutton and i
Herbert Passmore.
"Beau Brummell" will hold the boards j
for the first week of the engagement, j
! For the second week Mansfield will pre- 'â 
! sent on Monday and Tuesday nitrhts "The I
Story of Rodian the Student," Wednes- j
day, ' Thursday and Friday evenings and at
; the Saturday matinee "Prince Karl" and ;
: on Saturday night "Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde."
California Theater.
"The Night Clerk 1 ' commences the sec
ond and last week of its engagement at
the California Theater to-morrow night.
Peter Dailey's interpretation of the title '
role drew large houses last week, and a
number of songs sung by various mem
bers of the company have become popula r ,
particularly Jennie Teaman's "The Girl
From Gay Paree. "
Koland Keen follows the Dailey Com
pany at the California. He and his com
pany will present for the first time in this
City the comedy by the late David D.
Lloyd and Sydney Rosenfeld entitled
"The Politician, or The Woman's Plank."
It is a political satire which gives Reed
and the members of his organization op
portunities to raise hearty laughter. Mr.
Reed's company includes Isadore Rush,
who will appear in her latest successful
role of the original twentieth century
woman: Miss Mamie White, Mrs. Mary
Myers, Will R. Bernard, Charles Wyngate,
Sheridan Tupper, John Bunny, Julian
Reed and James Douglass.
Columbia Theater.
Pudd'nbead, Roxy, Rowy, the twins
and the rest of Mark Twain's char
acters in "Pudd'nhead Wilson" will only
disport themselves on the Columbia
boards for one week more. The play has
been drawing large houses and will no
doubt continue to do so till the end of the
engagement.
The rattling farce-comedy, "A Pair of
KUls," will follow "Pudd'nhead Wilson"
at the Columbia Theater. Ezra Kendall
will play the leading role. His character
ization is familiar to theater-goers from
one end of the country to another, for "A
Pair of Kids" is in the tenth year of its
success. Miss Edith Kingsley, who comes
with Ezra Kendall, is known as a ballad
singer and a composer of popular songs.
She made quite a hit in Cincinnati and
Cleveland with her song "Down on the
Ohio."
Grand Opera-Houae.
Jules Verne's story, "Michael Strogoff, "
is the attraction announced for the com
ing week at the Grand. It is a play that
has frequently been presented in this City
before, bat the coming production is to be
made unusually spectacular, and the
strengthened company will no doubt add
considerably to the attractions of the per
formance.
The scene painters have been hard at
work for some weeks preparing for the
production, particularly for the scene at
the imperial palace, Moscow, and the des
ert pictures in Siberia. A number of su
pernumeraries have been engaged to sup
plement the house's company^ The leading
roles are to be played by Darrell Vinton
and Lisle Leigh.
Tivoll OpÂ«ra-Houge.
The oriental spectacular burlesque "Blue
Beard" will be continued at the Tivoli
untit further notice. The cast includes
Ferris Ilartman as Ibrahim; Carrie Roma
as his scolding mite, Morgiana; W. 11.
West as their elder daughter, the famous
Sister Anne of the story; Fannie Liddiard
as Sflim and John J. Raffael as Blue
Beard. The other parts are played by Kate
Marchi, Thomas C. Leary, Anna Schnabel,
Fred Kavanagh, Ray Lynwood and
Hannah Davis" Features of the produc
tion are the ballets, led by Mile. Adele
Yercellessi and Sig. de Fii'lippi, and the
specialties of Irene Cook, Gilbert and
Goidie.
A second edition of "Blue Beard" is in
preparation, with new songs, dances and
ballets. Some of Chevalier"s coster son^s
will be substituted for the negro airs
After the run of "Blue Beard" a pr<>
duction of Dellinger's romantic opera
"Lorraine" will be heard for the first time
in this City, to be followed by an operatic
revival of Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Uncle
Tom's Cabin."
At the Orpheum.
The Hewetts, musical sketch artists,
and Lady Zctta, a mind reader, who is said
to perform several remarkable feats, are
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 12, 1896.
the new attractions promised at the
Orpheiim for the current week. The hold
overs are Jlosie Rendel, whose dancing has
been admired, ha Bella Carmen, who does
a graceful and clever tight-wire act, Elena
Leila, the "singing: don," Adonis Ames,
Segommer, the Nawne, Bruet and Riviere
and the Marvellcs.
On Sunday next the whole company will
po to Los Angeles to make room for the
Hopkins' Trans-Oceanic Star Specialty
Company, which comes all the way from
New York in its entirety without making
a stand on the way. The Trans-Oceanics
â¢will open at the Orpheum Monday, Aprii
20. The organization, it is said, has some
! of the best attractions that could be secured
in Europe and this country.
Grover'n Alcsirar.
The perennial "Cad the Tomboy" will
succeed "Ranch 10" at Grover's Alcazar on
Monday.
Leonard Grover will fill the part of
Thomas Ward, the gasman, with its
budget of drolleries and imitations of
popular actors. Clyde Hess, Gordon Fos
ter, Charles Edmonds, May Xobie,
Josephine Gassman, Fanny Young and
the rest of the company will rally to make
"Cad" a hit. At its last production it
played to the largest week's business at
popular prices which the Alcazar has
known.
There will be the usual matinees on
Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday.

will take place in Golden Gate Hall, on the
evening of the 30th inst.
MOUJESKA IS HOPEFIiL.
She Still Hopes to Return to the
Stage.
Apropos of the report that Mme. Mod
jeska has been struck by paralysis, the
New York Herald .says :
"Though nearly twenty years have
elapsed since Mine. Modjeskaiirst appeared
here many of us remember that event aa
if it had happened yesterday. It was of a
Saturday night in December. On the
afternoon of the same day and at the same
play houseâ the Fifth-avenue Theater-
Mary Anderson terminated her first New
York engagement in 'The Lady of Lyons. 1
Our own Mary was a thing of beauty even
in those early days, but not a joy forever.
She lovc-d to make the welkin ring, and
she used to stumble over her train like
Boulotite in 'Barbe Bleue.' Pauline, in
spite of much rhodomontade, can and
should be played quite naturally. Miss
Anderson brought to the part a beautiful
majestic personality, and ail the tiicksand
artifices of the old tragedy queens. The
people liked this manner.
"When in the evening, then, a strange
woman, without any great reputation out
side of her own country, came before us,
and with the utmost simplicity enacted
what has always been considered a traeic
role, neither the public nor the critics
knew what to make of it. Was she a great
actress, this distinguished looking foreign
er, who had eyes that were dark as night
and soft as violets, a Chopinesque voice
and a gait that made you think of Byron's
lines, 'She Walks in Beauty 1 ?
i "Too weak, thought the experts, after
the Lafontaine fable, and Ihe midnight
encounter with the Princess de Bouillonâ
for the piay was 'Adrienne Lecouvreur.'
Too weak, eh? During the whole last act
the spectators held their breath, so strong
was the nervous tension. And from that
night on the Polish artist's reputation was
firmly established here, as in her native
Poland. The women marveled at her
grace, the men at her intellectuality. She
was the h'rst naturalistic actress that had
come to us from abroad. As Camille a
fortnight later she became the rage. The
ladies raved over her while 'trying on'
at the dressmaker's; the men over their
brandy and soda at the clubs. But
she wanted to play Shakespeare â Juliet,
Rosalind, Viola, Isabelle, Beatrice. 'How
can she dream of such a thing with that
foreign accent of hers!' observed the wise
acres, shrugging their shoulders know
ingly. And she not only did play them,
for her will power was enormous, but posi
tively recreated some of these characters.
Rosalind, for instance, is dressed and
acted by our younger actresses nowadays
as Modjeska first played and dressed the
part. Her versatility was remarkable, her
imaginativeness nearly boundless. What
a wonderful Odette she was, and again
what a furor she made when she appeared
as Ophelia the night of the great Wallack
benefit at the Metropolitan Opera-house.
It is ineffably sad to think that a woman
whose gruce seemed indestructible should
be stricken down by one of the most
dreaded of all diseasesâ paralysis. Her
left arm, I am told, has become quite use
less. The actress herself is hopeful and
looks upon her visitation as only a tem
porary ailment. Should she be able to re
sume her calling, that wonderful wiil
power of hers will have as much to do
with it as the electricians."
Bloomers Did It.
\\hen it was announced a few months
ago that Hisa Lillian Rufspll was to make
her debut in "The Little Duke" there was
a chorus of "oh's!" and everybody won

Honest Proof!
Over 1000 Cures Have Been Accomplished by
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt in California
During the Past Six Months.
IW/n
The best proof of merit is the word of an
honest man, who has been cured.
"Dr. Banden'a Electric Belt cured me of sciatica in eight days." John K. Knox, Mare Island
Nary Yard, Vallejo, Oal.
"Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt cured me of paralysis in flye weeks." Frank Monarch, Gilroy,
Cal.
"Dr. Sanden's Kleetric Belt cured me of varicocele and weakness." Geo. Nash, Fifth aye.
and Crocker st., Los Angeles, Cal.
"I was so bad with lame bfl'k that I would almost cry with pain at times. Dr. Sanden's
Belt cured me in one night." Thos. O'Connor, 04 So. River St., San Jose, Cal.
"1 suffered from sciatica for five years, and wns frequently laid up. Nothing helped me till
I got Dr. Samlen's Klectric Belt, and it cured me in two days." S. D. Valentine, Francis &
| Valentine Printing Company, 517 Clay st., .San Francisco.

Oity address, 240 Montgomery St., San Francisco.
"Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt cured me of varicocele of 26 years' standing." L. L. Jaccard,
Jeweler, San Leandro, Cal.
"I was so low with nervous debility that I could not attend to my business. Dr. Sanden's
tlectnc Belt cured me a year ago, and I have been a new man ever since." Thos. Ray, Brooklyn
Hotel, San Francisco. ,
''In two months Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt cured me of sciatica, from which 'I had suffered

Points to Consider.
When you buy an Electric Belt you want the be3t made,
and it is well to understand, first, that the value of an Electric
Belt is in the strength of electricity it gives into your body.
This depends on the battery used. Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt is
made strongly, almost, indestructible, and it is POSITIVELY
GUARANTEED to generate a current of Electricity that you
can feel every time you charge it for one year. With care it
lasts live years. It has eighteen powerful elements, is perfectly
insulated and possesses what no other Electric Belt made has, a
regulator, so that you can regulate it while it is on the body.
Consider how slight is the cost of one of these wonderful
Belts ; consider the fact that it cures you while you rest at night ;
does not interfere in any way with your daily duties ; that it ha 9
a regulator which makes it mild or strong while it is on your
body â then be true to yourself ; get it get it to-day.

about it, with prices. It may save you a great deal of suffering
and expense.

A bicycle was to blame for it all.
Miss Russell learned to ride a bike last
cummer, and down at her country resi
dence on .Long Island she became accus
tomed to wearing bloomers when she went
out for a spin along the road. Well, when
it was suggested to her to appear as the
Little Duke she conceived the idea of dress
ing the part in bloomers â rather scanty
bloomers to be sure, but no scantier than
one often sees nowadays among the bicy
clists on the Donlevards. And so it was
done, and Chicago decided that Miss Rus

but handsome, just the same.

A bright little French comedy, written
by one of the members of the French de

Girls' High School Auditorium.
M. Emil Sauret, the violinist, has re
turned to Europe. His artistic success in
this country was very great, but otherwise
he had no reason to congratulate himself
on the result of his visit, more's the pity.
It is now a settled fact that Messrs.
Friedlander, Gottlob & Co. will have con
trol of Anton Seidl's trans-continental
tour, and that the organization with
several great soloists will appear here in
September next.
The trouble with our problem play
wrights is that they can't resist the temp
tation to get cheap and easy dramatic
effect by exaggeration. In that respect
they resemble our players who foam and
rant and weep floods of tears and other
wise take on to a degree not known among
the children of men.
The stage hands of the Herald-square
Theater Rave an exhibition the other day
and prove I that they could set and strike
all the scenes in "The Heart of Maryland"
in thirteen minutes and five seconds. Other
stage managers are to give similar exhibi
tions, and it is possible that there will not
be time enough to see even one man be

TRAVELLED-IN-JAPAN
AFEW years asro a party of four '
ladies, including the writer,
started on an overland trip from [
Kobe to Okayama in jinrikishaa
"We were a merry party as the
linrikisha men tucked us into their baby
{ferriages, and our two-legged horses were i
liso in the best of spirits. The jinrikisha
nen are very fond of traveling in com
panies, and on such occa>ions will some
times start oft wiih a shout and with such
ipeed as to make the heart of the occupant
Â»f the little vehicle palpitate with fear of
Â»eing tipped over â an experience not alto

Sometimes people think it mieht be un
laie for women to travel alone in a
aeathen land, but there we were, four
anprotected females, the eldest about 30. i
;he youngest a girl of 1,3, and by night we |
>rere forty-rive miles away from any other
rbite p&rson, sleeping in a Japanese coun
ty hotel without the least thought of tear.
Ihis was our first experience in traveling
my considerable distance in jinrikishas,
Â»nd especially in stopping at country
Jotels. The first nitrht we were fortunate
inougb to lind a hotel with a third story,
t:: i as the room was vacant we irnmpdi- i
itely engaged it. Aft r shunt; around

readiness, so after taking off our shoes ac
cording to custom, and "placing them on
the we proceeded to drag ourselves
ap tne ladder, for such may the steep
stairways of Japan \rell be called, being
ouilt thus to economize m space. On
reaching the room we threw ourselves
upon toe floor, there being nothing else to
recline upon. Our host soon appeared
and offered us the use of the hot bath. To
our inquiry if any one bad used it before
as we received an emphatic assurance that
we were the first. But another question
had to be settled â could any one see us
while we bathed? O, certainly not, it was
all perfectly private. So one of our party,
taking towel and soap, with great dilKcnlty
descended the steep stairway to the ground
floor. Upon being shown "the bathroom
what was her surprise to find that the siae of
the room which was toward the entry way
where people were constantly passing was
made of slats with spaces between an inch
or more wide. Upon making this dis
;overy the "foolish foreigner" decided to
forego the pleasure of a bath that night
much to tne disappointment of our host
Â»nd his friends.
As supper was not forthcoming and we
were very faint we clapped our hands to
:all an attendant. This brought forth a
prolonged yell from belowâ "Hi-l"â and
n a moment our hostess appeared. After
crying BMWt desperately to make her un
derstand what we wanted we had ourselves
worked up into quite a nervous state of
laughter. A few moments later, having
occasion to clap our hands again, the eld
est son appeared, and tne next time the
eldest daughter, and so on until the whole
family had satisfied their curiosity, each
new face that appeared sending us into a
fresh fit of laughter despite our efforts to
preserve our decorum.
At last dinner was ready. A white
wooilen bucketful of boiled "rice without
even sait iv it was placed in the middle of
the floor. A smail tray containing two
bowls was placed on the floor in front of
each of us. one of the bowls containing a
small bit of fish floating in the water in
which it was boiled â (soup, if we may so
call it) â the other bowl being empty tb re
ceive the rice which the maid gave to each
of us in turn, dipping it out of the bucket
with a large wooden iadle. With our chop
sticks we thrust the rice down our throats,
taking a swallow of the fish water now
and then to help it on its way.
This delightful repast over, we called at
once for our beds, which consisted of
great, heavy comforters spread on the
floor. The sensation after lying down
awhile is not very different from that one
experiences in sleeping on boards. To
show how Japanese ideas of cleanliness
differ from oars, this comforter had been
used for months without being washed,
but we had been warned and therefore
brought our sheets with us. The tuick
ness of the comforters prevented our tuck-
â  ing them in around our necks, so, although
I burdened witn their weinht, the cold chills
j creeping down our backs kept us company
I all ni^iit. The adjoining room was sep
arated from ours by sliding paper doors,
over which was an openine the full length
of the room ana about a foot wide; thus it
was quite possible for us to enjoy to the
full the tobacco smoKe and loud talking of
our neighbor guests until long past mid
night. Soon after every tiling had quieted
down a heavy thud on the floor near our
heads announced the arrival of a huge rat
through the opening above the door. We
were too thoroughly exhausted by this
time, however, to scream, go we weie
finally lulled to bleep by thoughts of rats
gnawing our noses off or crawling under
our comforters to get warm.
At daylight we were awakened by sounds
resembling thunder. It proved to'be noth
ing but the opening of the sliding wooden
doors, which have to be ciosed all around
the house every night to keep burglars out.
: We fain would have continued our nap
â  but the distance yet to be traveled rua.ie it
npcessary for us to start at 5 o'clock; so,
with eyes half-open, we partook of another
< savory meal and started <;n our second
I day's journey, not quite so jubilant as on
the previous day. When our bill was pre
sented we found that we were charged 30
cents apiece. We objected to paying such
â  an exorbitant price, having been told on
I good authority that 15 cents was the ordi

nary price of a night's lodging and two
meals; however, we had to yield, and
afterward learned ihat there are"tbree rea
sons why they charge foreigners more
than their own people. First, we have, or
are supposed to have, more money than
the Japanese; second, we make' more
trouble than they do, and third, very
few foreigners know enoueh to pay the ex
pected "cha dai" or tea fee which every
Japanese pays in addition to his bill. The
bill is supposed to express the exact cost
he has been to his host, and his "cha dai"
is a httle compliment he pays in addition
for the trouble lie has made.
The second night we drew up before a
low-roofed, two-story building, which was
recommended by our jinrikisbamen as
the best hotel in town. Thouen not at
all inviting in appearance there was no
alternative. Two rooms on the second
floor were at our disposal and were sep
arated as usual by paper partitions. We
decided not to use the first room because
of various odors floating up the stairway
from below, wtich it would be impossible
to describe. We were in an unusually
merry mood this evening, and by our own
constant chatter and bursts of* laughter
must have aroueed the suspicions of our
hoat. It was evident from the attention
we attracted that foreigners had rarely, if
ever, been seen in the place. After our
beds had been prepared we were proceed
ing to get ready for one night's rest(!)
and one of our number had already crawled
in between the comforters, when suddenly,
without a word of warning, the doors
flew open, ana there stood two men, our
host and a policeman, gazing at us with
solemn faces. We looked at one another
in dismay, and as the ludicrousness of the
situation dawned upon us, two of us sank
upon the floor overpowered with laughter,
while the most dignified of the party
calmly stood behind a screen resting her
elbows on tile top of it, and looking al~
ternately at the men and at us. As soon
as we were able to speak we found that the
policeman wanted to see our passports,
without which no foreigner was then al
lowed to travel in the interior of Japan.
No doubt he watched the house carefully
that night lest we might prove to be men
in disguise come to rob tne town. It is a
common saying among t> c Japanese
that American women look and act like
men.
To perform our morninc ablutions on
the veranda downstairs, with a number of
curious people gazing at us, was no small
trial of our moral courage. A basin of
water was placed on the veranJa, and get
ting down on our knees, we washed as best
we could, considering the conveniences
and the privacy we enjoyed. Tne use of
our toothbrushes caused a quiet kind of
merriment among the bystanders. In the
interior of Japan the old-fashioned tooth
brush, consisting of a small stick of white
wood, fringed at one end, so that it looks
lite a diminutive paintbrush, is stiil in
use. People will go about their work for
half an hour or so with one of these brushes
pushed back in their mouths between the
teeth and the cheek, and when the hands
are disengaged, occasionally give thetaeih
an extra scrub.
The return journey was made in tw
days, the jinrikisha men drawing-us ninety
miles in that length of time. They will
start to run immediately after eating, and
we never heard them complain of indiges
tion. One day one of our men stopped
suddenly, stooped down, and picking up a
dead snake, very deftly stripped the skin
off, and before we had time to think it was
down his throat.
One of our party, when stopping once at
the leading hotel in a large city, with a
Japanese girl for a companion, met with
an experience which was startling at the
time, tut which ehe can look back upon
now with feelings of amusement. Desir
ing to avail herself of the privileges of the
bathroom and learning that all was in
readiness, she proceeded thither and had
begun to disrobe, when suddenly a door
opened, and a man clad in nature's garb
entered the room. With perfect calmness
and deliberation he proceeded to dip water
out of the tub to give himself a sort of a
shower-bath. It turned out that he
had been down to the river, a few
steps from the hotel, for a cold
plunge, and had just returned to
eive the finishing touches in the bathroom.
Meeting a lady there did not disconcert
him in the least. Fhe, however, fled in
consternation to her room, to tell her com
panion what a terrible thing had hap
pened. The girl then proceeded to explain
to the hotel-keeper that foreigners must
be aione when they bathe. Ho thereupon
promised to guard the doors (there being
no locks) while this strange guest occupied
the bathroom. There was an expression
of amusement on the faces of the Japanese
to think that we should care about such
things. Th.-y laugh at us because we do
care, and we laugh at them because they
do not.
We learned enough of the language to
discover that they have only one word â
"hadzukashi" â for our three words, mod
est, bashful and ashamed.
It is not surprising, therefore, that mod
esty is something they know little about.
We would not say, However, that because
of this the Japanese are an immoral peo
ple. Indeed, they look upon nudity with
such chiid-like innocence that one almost
ceases to be shocked after being among
them for a time. In the hottest weather
tne children of the iower classes run about
freely, clad only in their little dark skins.
A lady who was in Japan when the men
first adopted the European drsss was rid
ing in me steamcars on a very hot day
when a Japanese gentleman, the only
other occupant of the car, took off his
coat, pants and vest, and folding them up
carefully laid them on the seat, going the
rest of the journey in his underclothes.
No doubt he was cool and comfortable, and
in the eyes of his countrymen he was sen
sible.
Believine, as is so commonly reported,
that the Japanese are a very clean people,
it was with some surprise we learned that
even the most fastidious wear one night
gown all winter without washing. This
garment is made oi either silk or cotton,
very thickly wadded. In some families
the value of a frequent airing in the sun
shine is understood, and this takes the
place of washing. Woolen goods are only
just beginning to be used there, the Japan
ese having none of their own manufacture.
If they are as clean a people as they are
represented to be we conclude that there
must be different standard; of cleanliness.
To be sure, they are fond of the hot bath
especially the public bath, where dozens
of people use the same water â but we
think that the European standard of
cleanliness is a little superior to theirs.
We would prefer their way to that of the
Chinese, however, who take no bath
throughout the winter.
At one time, visiting some hot spring?,
we desired to taste the water. A man in
attendance took a cup, and rolling up his
"kimono" walked right into the large
bathtub, the water being about three feet
deep, atid reaching a little beyond where
he btood dipped out a cupful of water and
offered it to us. l.ut we suddenly decided
that mineral water was not good for our
digestion and hastily departed without
much ceremony. jScphemia Bubton.
Whist
[All communications concerning whist, an
swers to problems, etc., should- be addressed
"Whist Editor," Call, City.]
Many of our whist readers no douot have
had tbeir attention called to the new whist
plays that seem to be the fad nowadays.
Nearly every whist club in the country,
young, middle-aged and old, has a lot of
players who jump at every new fad as a
trout does to a fly.
livery whist player in this country has
heard of the whist king, Mr. John H.
Briggs of Minneapolis. The following is
what he says on the new whist plays in
the Minneapolis Tribune:
The past few months have brought out many
w. w suggestions relative to the correct methods
o( play. The so-called "short-suit game" has
h:tl a good a;rini{. I;s advocate of "monu
mental orass" iarna will probably continue to
unfold hi.s tnlo <>!' woe until he gets tired, sev
eral new systems 01 discard have been placed
before the whist world. Xew leads irom pecu
liar combinations have come to the front.
Many other plays which are said to win tricks
and make whist easy have been brought to
light, invariably by writers who have no whist
reputation.
These plays have had much influence with
becinners, and many have adopted them as
law. We are often confronted with questions
with regard to niany of these new plays. When
we have time we answer them as beat we can.
Whether we give an answer or not, our parting
advice touching the merits of the plays is as
follows: If you are lar enough advanced in the
game of whist to judge of the merits oi a ulav
by trial Rive thorn n, test. Otherwise let thtni
alone and follow the old established game
until you find a fair share of the players of
recognized ability recommending the new
plays. If a play has merit the stronger players
will discover it, and you will lind it out in "due
course of time.
There is no law to compel persons to do
right when they wish to do wrong. If a
player wishes to lead fourth best from
ting jack ten and others, or ten from
queen jack ten and others, he has that
privilege. In our opinion it is much bet
ter to stick to the textbooks, and make
the leads in accordance therewith. N. B.
Trist, the father of the American lead sys
tem, in a recent letter says: "I see "no
reason for departing from the time
honored custom of leading ten from King
jack ten; or queen from queen jack ten.
It is without doubt trick-winning to lead
fourth b-st from ace and four others â not
holding king or queen jack."
We give below a deal that occurred in
Brooklyn the other evening, when N. and
S. made 13 tricks on the original, or at
table 1, and only 5 tricks at table 2.
From the lead of the fourth best from
ace and six others:
Trump â Xine of clubs.
Leaderâ Wast.
At table 1 west opened with jack of
spades. South winning with ace, led the
fourth best heart.
At table 2 the opening leaa was the
same, south winning; he opened with ten
of diamonds and made 5 tricks.
WHISTLETB.
An English gentleman, writing to the
London Field of March 14, recommends
the trial of the American seven-point
game of whist without honors and no
rubbers in the clubs, instead of the five
point game and playing rubbers. The
object, no doubt, is to try to abolish play
ing for stakes.
John Fetch Hewby, author of "Whist or
Bumblepuppy" and "The Decline and
Fall of Whist," died a few days ago at his
home in England. It is sad to announce
to the whist world the death of such a
brilliant writer. He was known as "Pem
bridge" as Henry Jones is known as
"Cavendish." He has left his footprints
on the sands of time.
E. H. Shepard, one of the founders of
the Portland Whist Club and ex-director
of the American Whist League, is spend
ing a few weeKs in the City.
D. E. Clark, a whist expert of Santa
Paula, was a visitor at the Trist Club dur
ing the past week.
President R. 13. Calley of the Linda Vista
Club of Oakland has just selected his team
that will play for the Rideout trophy now
held by the San Francisco Whist Club.
President George E. Bates of the San
Francisco Whist Club has donated an ele
eant trophy to be played for by the ladies
of the club'only.
The Trist Duplicate Whist Club has re
duced the initiation fee to $2 50 and
monthly dues all around $1 a month in
stead ol $1 50. The beautiful suite of rooms
they occupy in the new Wenban building
and the moderate expense should be
enough to induce all lovers of the game to
join a strictly whist club.
A match p-ame of whist between the
Woodland Whist Club of Woodland, Cal.,
and the Trist Club of this City is now be
ing arranged, eight players on a side.
By accident our whist column appeared
on Monday last week. It will be found in
its usual place hereafter on Sunday.
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
The "Tramp Trays" that were on this
coast a while a^o were a set of hands to
be played under what is known as "mem
ory whist," and is not recognized or
played in any lirst-class whist oluo.
T"he American Whist League adopts no
"authority" for whist play, nor does it
recognize or adopt any system of leads.
So all cards or pamphlets sant out stating,
"As adopted t>y the American Whist
League," are fakes.
The best whist publication you can get,
outside of The Call, is "Whist," a monthly
journal devoted exclusively to the game,
published in Milwaukee, Wis. ; costs $1 a
year. There are several hundred books
published on the game, and they are all
good. One of the latest i 3 "Whist of To-
Day," by Milton C. Work.
Our Petaluma wnist correspondent writes
as follows :
Our whist club here is in a thriving condi
tion, having an attendance of from seven to
ten tables on our regular meeting nights. .Our
beginners' claos meets every Friday afternoon.
In or^er to encourage study in that class, we
will ou the til st Friday afternoon in May have
a test in the t'undtunent&l principles of whist
as found in Cavendish. A copy or Hamilton is
offered by the club to the one making the best
showing, and F. H. Atwater donates one year's
subscription to Whist as a second priÂ£e. We
are very anxious to have this prove a success
and get the beginners to study. If they once
get a good start in the right way they will not
be very apt to give it up, and", no doubt, we
will be able to get some good players iv that
way. I send you a hand that came iv play the
other afternoon. It brought about a good deal
of discussion, and I do not think any of us are
satisfied now. I should like to know what you
would do under the circumstances. The deal
was as follows:
The question is what should south lead
in return?
This is a very nice situation, and we
submit it to our readers for criticism and
will publish the play of the best answer.
SOLUTION OF riiOBLEM NO. 1.
Ws have had a large number of answers
from our first; problem. No. 1. and it ia a
close race between George ii. D'Arcy of
this City and E. C. Hill of Oakland. Both
show a great deal of good whist percep-
tion. They have both carefully analyzed
the situation, and they both show them
selves to be good students of the game.
They are boih prize-winners. Unfortu
nately for us the prize that we offered does
not come in two volumes. Although it
does come in two parts, we cannot divide
it, so we send to each a copy of "Whist of
To-Day" with our compliments.
The problem was as follows: South
deals and turns up the two of clubs. West
leads king of spades, North plays the five
of spades, East the two of spades, and
South trumps with the two of clubs and
leads the king of hearts.
What is the development and how many
cards of each suit can you place?
West's lead marks four cards only in
spades, the kins; winning the trick, show
ing that West or East holds the ace. Mr.
D'Arcy cays North might "underplay,"
holding the ace. if he held the ace it
would be called "passing the trick," not
"underplay." We explained underplay
in our last whist article (Monday, April
6). North evidently plays his smallest
spade, and East has not four
or he would retain the lowest to
enable his partner to count num
ber, youth trumping with the deuce and
leading king of hearts shows four hearts
exactly. If South held rive diamonds he
would have selected that suit to lead from,
instead of a four-card suit, and if he held'
six trumps originally, he would have led
a trump, with five remaining. Not doing
so, Souths original holding must h<ive
been four hearts, four diamonds and five
clubs. West holding but four spades, the
other nine are divi led between North and
East. It is quite certain North holds at
least six. Outside of placing the exact
number of each suit held by South, the
other holdings cannot be placed.
Next week we give solution to problem
2, naming the winner.

I', uen a Vista Avenue.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 11.â The Com
missioners that had to do with the open
ing and extension of Buena Vista avenue
condemned a strip of land between Sher
man and Benton streets 60x515 feet in size
for right of way. It belonged to Perata
Bros., vegetable gardoners. They were
awarded the sum of $2150 for the property,
but refused to accept it, demanding some
$6000 for land and damages, and condemna
tion proceedings were accordingly brought.
The suit was tried on Friday and Satur
day before Judge Ogden. All the real
estate men in Alameda testified as to the
value of the land, ranging from $1500 up
to $4000, the most of them keeping in the
immediate vicinity of $2000. Judge Ogden
gave judgment for $2528 25, wich is $378 25
more than the Commissioners awarded.
A supplemental assessment will now be
made to raise this sum and also the ex
pense incidental to the suit.
Suit Against the Kailroad.
ALAMEDA. Cal., April 11.â W. H.
Crozier, a shingler living on Hay street,
brought suit to-day in the Recorder's

damages. As cause for complaint he al
leges that on Wednesday last ne roae to
tue mole, and after having purchased a
ticket for Berkeley passed through the
Â§ate, where the ticket was taken up, and
oarded the Berkeley train. At Emery
ville, as he avers, the conductor insisted
on a show of ticket or the payment of fare,
and as he considered that he had paid his
fare refused to pay it again. He was forth
with ejected, niucli to his humiliation and
injury. He had to walk a mile to Lorin
station to take another car.

MY. wasn't Easter Sunday a
rainy, rainy day ! Just lots and
lots of boys and girls who had
beautiful new spring clothes to
wear felt a tiny bit disappointed
when they saw what a trick Misa April
was playing on them, but they went to

winter clothes, and when they got there
they didn't think for an instant about line
hats or bonnets. Oh.no! The air was
too full of the fragrance of the pure white
lilies and the sweet strains 'Of music to !
allow worldly thouents to enter in.
And then it was lots of fun to hunt for J
Easter eggs behind chairs and under j
tables and in all the cozy coiners of your i
own dear homes.

las very glad you all love the poppy so j
much. I have been delighted at the inter
est you have taken in it. Do you ever
press flowers? If possible get a poppy
plant by the rootsâ one possessing perfect
leaves, buds, blossoms and seed pods; ,
then press it between the leaves of a blot- I
ting pad, with heavy weights on top.
When its moisture is all absorbed place it j
in a scrapbook, securing it by little strips
of gum Daper here ai:d there.
If you wish to send it to some iriend I \
am sure be will appreciate it very much.
Or if you should move to some other j
State yourself you would be very happy to
possess a perfect specimen of our State

DONALD SEEIES FOR TINY BOYS.
The noisy old alarm clock, with its ring
a-ting-a-ling whirr-whir-r-r-r, awakened
Donald very early on Easter morning. It
didn't make him real wide awake, but just
left him on the very edge of slumber land.
The sweet music of the gently pattering
rainarops soon had almost lulled him into
another peaceful sleep, when the low tap
ping, rapping seemed to change to the
music Of a band! Yes, it was a band!
Why, there must be a procession! And
the little boy sat un in bed and rubbed his
eyes very hard to get all the sleepy out.
What was his joy to see, on the other
side of the room, coming toward him, a
really procession, bright with all the colors
of the rainbow and made up of the oddest
things that had ever before marched
through the land of play.
Out of bed Donald jumped in a jiffy and
tiptoed softly across the room, as if fearful
the wonderful things might, on his ap
proach, bo spirited away. Leading the
comnany was the sauciest yellow, fluffy
chicken, with outspread black wings, that
ever was hatcned from the egg of the
magic white rabbit.
It kept bobbing its head up and down in
a very funny fashion, and Donald is pretty
sure that it winked at him with one of its
shiny black bead eyes. Behind it walked
another beauty, a snowy rabbit with, oti,
sum immense ear?, pretty pink eyas and a
gut paper collar around his graceful neck.
But the funniest thing about it was that
under the rabbit wa<? a cute green mossy
nest full of small colored egÂ« 3.
When Donald touched the bunny's side
with the tip of nis rosy tongue he lound
out something â something very sweet.
Yes, that bunny was made of pure white
sugar!
Following these came one of the dear
little brownies whom we all know so well.
It was the comical brownie jockey
doing his best to struggle out of a paste
board egg, where he~ was very much
pushed and crowded by a whole lot of
speckled candy eggy.
Next came a really frying-pan made of
DONALD SAW COMING TOW'AED Ui.Yl A liEAL PROCESSION.
iron just like the ones your mamma uses,
only many times smaller.
In it were some nice fried eggs and a
! slice of breakfast bacon; at least that is
' just what they looked like, but when Don
' aid treated them as he had the bunny's
j side, he said they were make-believe eggs
; and bacon and were made of candy, too.
The pert young chick, the snowy rabbit,
i the quaint brownie boy and the strong lit
| tie pan were followed by Sir Humpty
! Dumpty, his brothers and sisters,
his cousins and bis aunts, wearing
i the broadest of grins and the gay
est of coats and gowns. How they
did roll and tumble over the floor as Don
ald danced among them. Of course the
procession was broken up in a very short
! time, for soon the little boy had all of his
j new toys gathered in a heap on his lap,
, giving to one a hug and a kiss, to another
; a loving loolc, with an occasional lick from
the rosy tongue.
Lots of fun with them all did he have
j during the long hours of that rainy Easter
j day, but at nightfall when the blue eyes
j closed and the golden head nestled down
j in the soft pillow, there, tightly clasped
i by chubby ringers, cuddled close to the
warm neck was the saucy little yellow
duck. So 1 think of all that Queer proces
sion, Donald loves him best.
Wild Strawberrjpg,
Mabel and Lina had quarreled.
Neither of them could quite tell how it
happened, but the bluejay, who was sitting

[Reproduced from the Youth's Companion.]
in a crotch of the old pear tree, peeped out
of her nest and heard Mabel say:
"You're a hateful girl, Lina Maybee, and
I shan't ever speak to you again."
"I don't want you to speak to me," said
Lina; "and I shan't tell you where there's
a big patch of wild strawberries that I
found yesterday. I'm a-going to pick 'em
all myself."
Mabel pulled her sunbonnet over her
face and started across the tall clover to
the house, and Lina pulled her sunbonnet
over her face and went off through the
orchard toward her own home.
"Why, Lina," said her mother, who was
churning down at the sprinphouse,
"what's the matter? Wasn't Mabel at
home?"
"She was at home," said Lina, sulkily;
"but she's a cross, hateful, disagreeable
thing, and says she'll never speak to rue
again."
Mrs. Maybee laughed.
'I thought you girls would have a quar
rel before long," she said, making her
chnrndash fly again.
Mabel went slowly along through the
tall clover. Her cheeks were flushed and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 12, 1896.
her eyes were brighter than seemed quite
natural.
When dinner was ready, she could not
eat anything, although her favorite chicken
pot pie was on the table.
Her mother began to grow alarmed.
"The child must be sick," she said, "or
she would certainly eat her dinner."
So Mabel was put to bed, and before
night she was in a high fever.
The doctor came, and after looking at
her tongue and feeling of her pulse he
left some medicine and went away.
The medicine was very bitter, indeed,
but it helped Mabel, and by the next morn
ing she was much better/though not able
to sit up.
"What would you like to eat, Mabel?"
said her mother, when the dinner was
ready.
"Nothing; unless I could have some
strawberries," said Mabel, faintly.
'"My dear child, I don't know'where we
could get strawberries." said her mother.
"But here is a nice baked apple. Won't
that do?"
But no; nothing would do. All Mabel
wanted was strawberries.
"Lina knows were there are plent-y,"
she thought, "but she is goint: to gather
them all for herseif."
And the tears came into Mabel's eyes.
She raised herself on the bed and looked
out of the open window toward the fresh
green woods and hills. As she dtd so she
caught a glimpse of Lina with a basket in
her hand walking slowly down the path
across the glade.
"She's eoing after the strawberries now,''
thought Mabel sadly, and tnen she won
dered if Lina would not juve her one â ju-t
oneâ of the bright scarlet berries if she
asked her.
"11l watch till she comes back,"
thought Mabel, "and get mamma to go
out and asE her for one.
So Mabel lay, with her face toward the
window, watching the path by which
Lina would come on her way home.
She watched for a long time, but at last
she fell asleep.
It was Jate in the afternoon when she
awoke, and the shadows thrown by the
tall trees had crown very long and were
stiil stretching out toward the setting sun.
A catbird had perched on a hopvine
near the house and was singing his even
ing song. Mabel had been dreaming
about the strawberries. Her dream -was so
vivid she almost fancied she could smell
the luscious fruit.
"Mabel, are you awake?" asked her
mother.
And opening her eyes Mabel saw, not
only Ler mother, but Lina! Lina, with
sunburnt cheeks and berry stained fin-,
gers, and in her hands a little willow bas
ket heaping full of ripe, scarlet strawber
ries !
"I didn't eat a single one, Mabel," she
said, kissing the sick girl's cheek, ''but
saved 'em every one for you."
And the bluejay in the old pear tree
peeped out of her nest and twittered softly
to herself as Lina tripped gayly through
the clover with the empty basket in her
hand.
'Well, well, girls are not such bad
creatures after all," said Mrs. Jay to her
self, as she nestled down on to her eggs
again.
At least that's what she thought, I dare
say, if she didn't say it.â Helen M. Whit

To the Editor of The Call: My father takes The
Call, and I am very much interested in the
children's page.
I will tell all I know about the poppy. The
poppy grows most everywhere in "Tulare
County. It grows on the mountains and on
level ground.
Its color is a deep yellow in the middle,
shading off to a bright yellow. There are quite
a number of stamens.
There are four petals and they are smooth.
They have bitter juice and the juice is coior
less. There are hardly ever wh .te ones and be
fore they bloom they have a hood on.
They have three names. One is poppy, an
other esehscholizia and the other" is Califor
nia State flower.
The pollen is yellow and the sepals all to
gether is called the calyx. This is all I know
about the poppy.
I am a little girl, 10 years old, and this is mv
first letter to The Call, and I will be very
much pleased if you will publish this if there
is room. Your little friend,

OF
SCIENCE, LITERATURE
AND
ART
ITOOK in one of the kinetoecope
rooms on Broadway this afternoon,
having for a companion a gen
tleman who has just returned
from Europe, says the New York
correspondent of the Pittsburg Dispatch.
After ho had taken a few peeps at the
latest things with which the interesting
toys have been loaded he said: "These
are all very well in their way, but they're
not in it with tho cinematographe." The
â word made a big mouthful, and he
paused awhile before resuming in this
â wise: "Just before I left London I was
one of a select company present at a pri
vate view of the cinematographe. What
is it? Why, as Celia says in 'As You Like
It,' 'Oh, wonderful, wonderful, and most
wonderful, wonderful.' It is the latest de
velopment of instantaneous photography,
by which an accurate development is pro
tiuced in pictures of real, living, moving
ecenes. To obtain an idea of the im
pression produced, you have only to im
agine a photograph come to life, with
every movement faithfully reproduced. It
is photography taken Mn the action' and
api lied, not to single living figures only,
but to whole scenes. A puff of smoke
from a steam engine, the spray of the sea,
the gestures and movements of every indi
vidual member of a crowdâ all this is
shown on the screen upon which the
pictures are projected. The figures are al
most life-size, and the remarkable effects
produced are almost indescribable and
positively uncanny in their realism.
"Wonderful as was each one of the
series which I had the pleasure of viewing,
I will only bore you with a couple, which
I consider the most wonderful of all â the
'Arrival of tbe Train' and 'bathing.' In
the first, you see the rush of the locomo
tive, the gradual slackening, the stoppage
at the station ; the crowd on the platform
steps back, the carriage doors open, tbe
passengers alight and others take their
places. All is bustle and confusion. In
'bathing' a number of lads dive from a
pier into the sea. As they me^t the water
the spray rises from the waves that are
rolling with a verisimilitude that is start
ling. But the interest of the tiling is in
exhaustible, for once the flush of novelty
is passed, the attraction may be revived
and revived again by new pictures. Where
all this is going to end one cannot tell.
For the present, however, in this French
development of Edison's toy, London has
the biggest attraction of the sort that it
has had for years. Of course the cinemato
jiraphe will astonish New York ere long.
When you see it you'll not set me down
a romancer, either." We'll wait and see.
A Tidal Bell Buoy.
A patent for a current-actuated bell buoy
vrith many novel features has been re
cently granted to A. L. "Woodworth, says
Showing the Bell and Channel.
the Philadelphia Record. The action from
the force of current is wholly automatic,
the float upon which the superstructure
and bell is mounted cuts and shifts from
eide to sid?, causing the float to list. The
ball confined inside the tube, having free
I assape, strikes the bell with great force.
The bell will ring equally as well by the
action of the sea. The feature that is most
norel is that it is most efficient when the
water is the smoothest. Just so long as
ttiere i* motion in the water, whether tidal
or current, it is sufficient to ring the bell.
This feature will be most appreciated by
masters and pilots for the reason that, as a
Tidal Bell Buoy.
rule, when thick fog hangs over the waters
a death-like stillness everywhere prevails;
it is then the anxious captain feels his way
slowiy alone, listening lor some familiar
sound to safely guide him. lie has no
hope of bearing a bell that is alone actu
ated by the sea. He knows the tide is
moving, either ebb or flood, and that the
tidal bell buoy is at work, giving forth in
clear tones its notes of warning.
Decreases the Dock Supply.
One of the most remarkable accusations
brought against the new photography is
ihat of an American Field writer, who
cays: "I think photography has done a
great deal to decrease the supply of ducks,
which," lie very properly adds, "will be
news, no doubt," to many of his readers.
Sportsmen have been saying that nothing
but the general adoption of cameras in
etead of firearms will save the game, ami
now to run up against such a statement as
that is to say the least astonishing.
It appears that "for the purpose of per
fecting the picture albumen must be used,
and this can be procured only from eggs.
Chicken eggs are too valuable as food,
therefore the Hebrides Islands of Scotland,
Lofoden of Norway, Labrador, Green
land, South America, and, in fact, every
conceivable breeding ground of wild birds,
are robbed of eggs by natives or men from
extensive sailing expeditions. This is
especially hard on the ducks of various
kinds, particularly in Labrador, where
they breed in thousands of nests to the
square mile, while the scavenger birds of
the sea, the va r ious gulls ani terns, suffer
from these depredations. The birds can
not stand this drain long, and the ques
tion arises what will happen when a:l the
eggs are gone ?"
An Alcohol Incandescent Lump.
In France an apparatus has lately been
invented for producing an incandescent
light rivaling that of electricity, from a
lamp fed solely by alcohol. It is called
the cellophane burner, and can be adapted
1. Lamp. 2. Interior.
3. Vapor generator. 4. Globe-holder.
to the receiver of any ordinary portable
lamp. The mode of operation is described
as follows: First, the small heating ar
rangement â resembling a night lamp with
a regulatorâ shown centrally in figure 3 of
our illustration, is set going. The alcohol
is carried from the re-ervoir by wicks pass-
Ing through four columns (Fig. 3 A) into
the dome B. and is vaporized.
The vapors ascend through C, Fig. 2,
into D, where they may be lighted. The
hanging cylinder. G (whose material is not
mentioned) quickly becomes incandescent,
yielding a pure white light of dazzling
brilliancy. The inventor estimates that
one of these lamps, having an illuminating
power of fifty candles, will consume, per
hour, from forty to fifty grams of alcohol,
costing, in France, 1 franc per liter of 800
grams. It would seem, therefore, to be
nearly or quite as cheap as kerosene, while
stated to be much less dangerous. â Popu

Thougiitg Read by Machine.
If the accounts given of a new machine
just completed by Julius Ernner of this
city, says the Washington correspondent
of the Philadelphia Times, are not too
hopeful it is the most won lerful of dis
coveries, for it lifts man out of the plane
of the material and reads his most secret
thoughts, laying bare his mind as if be
neath a microscope, and recording each
idea as it is given birth in the brain. If it
was a great feat to photograph through a
solid substance it is an almost miraculous
performance to take mental photographs,
which can be secured unknown to the
person, photographs which will tell every
intangibledream which floats through the
soul.
The machine, which is now in the hands
of a patent lawyer, is a cylinder about six
or eight inches long nnd an inch and a
half in diameter. It is coated with an ex
ceedingly sensitive chemical, which is
easily decomposed by the electric current.
In front is a line needle of aluminum,
coated at its point with chemicals, and
resting on the cylinder, while the base is
set in a diaphragm of aluminum, a very
thin plate of the Jatter being used. In
front is a large, open, somewhat horn-like
*rra:i_'enient. which is intended to convey
the vibrations direct to the recorder. The
machine is put in action by means of a
small motor, which revoive3 the cylinder,
the thought forces causing the needle to
make upon the surface of the cylinder im
pressions which correspond with the vi
brations.
There is, of course, an electric induction
coil connected with the apparatus. The
person vrhose thoughts are to be read is
seated about three feet in front of the ma
chine and lets his mind pursue any train
of thought he desires. The motor is set
going and within a few moments the cyl
inder has done its work and a finer and
more delicate needle is put in place of the
recording one, for the mind is to De rerd
from the impressions. Connection is made
with the secondary induction coil and
wires leading from the electrodes are
placed at the base of the brain of the
reader. The ideas which had passed from
THE MACHINE THAT REGISTERS THE THOUGHTS.
THE SAINT JfKANCISCO CALIj, HUJNDAI, AfRIL IS, 1536.
the first person into the machine are now
transmitted into the mind of the second
person with absolute fidelity and perfect
accuracy, the thoughts being received in
an unconscious manner â that is, not by
any sound or any written word, but the
conception frames itself in the mind of the
second person just as it was given being
in that of the first. It is just reproduced.
That the machine will do all that is
claimed for it has, it is said, been proven
not only by tne inventor but by Beveral
other persons. An experiment was tried
with two friends to whom he had been ex
plaining his invention. Mr. Emner had
thoughts recorded and then let his friends
read them by placing the wire 3 from the
electrodes at the base of their brains. As
soon as they had finished expressing their
astonishment one of them was j>laced near
the cylinder, and when Mr. Emner read
the record it ran, "Am I in an insane
asylum or am I hypnotized?" showing
that the man's mind was full of wonder
at the things he was experiencing. When
he went away he told that he had been
hypnotized, not being able to comprehend
that such a wonderful power existed as
thought recording.
As thoughts vary in intensity, Mr. lim
ner showed that the degrees would be
marked upon the machine. He procured
a dog, and by teasing it threw it into a
violent rage when near the cylinder. The
record showed that the dog's mina was
powerfully agitated, for the vibrations
were intense, hence it is to be seen that by
Eraner's invention not only human feel
ings, but those of the animal creation are
open to our mind's eye.
The uses to wnich this invention can be
put are numberless. To be able to pre
serve the record of our own thoughts,
which we can read off at will; to be able
to take down the thoughts of another
when they may be unconscious of the
operation; to fathom the brain of the
poet; to examine the minds of the insane;
to discern the secret thoughts of our
friends, and to trace the workings of crime
in the brain of the criminal are all fields
of unlimited boundaries, operations of
which science has as yet scarcely dreamed.
The business man can sit at his desk,
think out replies to his letters without
opening his lips, and his clerk write them
out from the cylinder while the man is
miles away.
The author need no more dictate to a
stenographer, for this machine will take
the ideas in their very birth, and ho.d them
for posterity. The maid whore lover is
bashful can detect his tender thoughts.
There can be no deceit practiced on one
who=e office is fitted out with such a con
science-piercing friend, for the aims and
motives of those about us will be, if they
are echoed in their thoughts, as clear to us
as the day. The murderer will be con
fronted with a proof of his crime, and the
punishment of* offenders will be an easy
task.
The Fluoroscope.
There has already appeared in these
columns a description of the ''Fluoro-
Fluorescent Screen.
scope," invented by Thomas A. Edison, to
enable surgeons and others to observe
directly the bones of the limbs without the
intervention of photography. To-day there
is reproduced a picture of t!ie device*. The
uprer end is made to lit the head around
the eyes much thÂ° same as a stereoscope,
and when the light is turned on the device
is held over the i>art to be examined with
the light beyond. The appearance of the
bone at once appears on the inside of the
screen, which forms the bottom of the box.
The Sun, the Moon and the Tides.
Most people suppose that the moon
alone is responsible for the phenomenon
of tides, but the attraction of the sun is
also an important factor. Of course the
distanoe of the sun from the earth is un-
thinkably greater than that of the moon,
but its mass is so enormous that it has
considerable tide-producing influence.
The force which the sun exerts is the same
on both sides of the earth at tn.e same
time, the tide-producing force of the great
orb being -about four-tenths that of the
moon. At the time of both new and full
moons the "wane spheroids" produced by
both the sun and the moon have their
"axes coincident,' 1 that is to say, the two
great orbs unite their energies on the
fluids of our planet, and as a result the
tides are higher than the average for the
remaining portions of the month. These
are tne "spring tides." The "neap tides"
come in the time of the moon's first and
third quarter and are not as great as the
average, because the moon and the sun
are each working in opposition to the
other.
Hold-Fast Wrench.
Here is a new form of wrench, the inven
tion of two English mechanics. It is de
signed to provide a tool which will give
the requisite gripping power without slip
ping and will not bulge or damage the
work. The wrench comprises a bifurcated
hand lever in the double eye or jaws of
which is mounted upon a square spindlo a
non-rotiitable sprock tor stud wheel of br.ii

or the like the chain is fitted around same,
and its free end passed between, the links
and carried over the fixed sprocket wheel
gearing therewith. Then on the applica
tion of force to the lever in the proper
direction the wheel teeth pull upon the
chain and cause it to grip the article !
firmly and with equal force all round. In !
the illustration the pipe is shown in posi
tion of being wrenched. When the lever
is depressed theteetli of the wheel tighten
the chain until the grip and leverage tire
together sufficient to turn or wrench the
pipe as required. â Philadelphia Record.
Bicycles on Railroad*.
Bicycle riders are constantly transport
ing their wheels on the railroads during
the summer months, and the delicate con
struction of the bicycle makes it difficult
to handle. Of late years the traffic has be
come so large that plans are now being de
vised by which the bicycles can be carried
safely and without hindrance to boxed and
crated merchandise. Last week a Western
railroad issued instructions that its bag
gage-cars ba supplied with bicycle racks

for the use of wheels. Similar steps will
likely also be taken on all the roads
throughout the country. In France, where
the bicycle Uses the railroads a great deal,
a very simple contrivance has been
adopted, as is shown in the illustration.
It is a small hook, which Is attached to
the bicycle and caught on strips in the
ceiling and sides of the cars. This plan
removes the wheels from the floor space of
the car, so that they do not interfere with
any other class of baggage.
A Hint From Afar.
A telegraphic operator on one of the
morning papers recently told me a story
of how ho <rot rid of a too frequent visitor,
whose mghtlv calls during business bours
had come to be a nuisance. The intruder
was al?o an operator, but was temporarily
out of a job. One evening he came in as
usual and planted himself in a chair. Re
ceiving no answers to his questions, he
lapsed into silence and listened to the
steady click of the instrument. Suddenly
a look of disgust crossed his face. He
arose, glared at the operator, who kept on
writing, turned on his heel and walked
out. This happened a week aso, and he
has not called since. What was the cause
of his sudden departure? That is eas ly
answered. In response to a previous re
quest the operator at the other end of the
line sent this message: "Is that idiot with
you again to-night?"â Syracuse Post.

that ia tilled with drained refuse, inserted
into the stove or range pipe, where the
contents dry, without smell escaping, and
are converted into a sort of charcoal that
burns nicely.
What Queen Victoria Reads.
Her Majesty has during the recent
months been 'busily reading the works of
various poets, beginning with those of Mr.
Henley. The greal lady positively de
lights in the earlier novels of William
Black. "Thf! Princess of Thule" was at
one time her favorite book, and she is de
voted to the works of George Eliot. Al
though the Queen, in her literary as well
aa musical tastes, is inclined to be some
what conservative, it need not be said that
she neglects the work of newer writers.
She much likes William Watson's poems,
and has read and reread his "Lachrymse
Musarum."â Woman at Home.
Charing Cross.
In reading English history you will hap
pen across numerous references to Charing
Cross, but the chances are you will won
der if the allusion is to a real cross erected
as a memorial or simply a cross roads.
Charing Cross was formerly one of the
noted landmarks of Britain, and its his
tory is as follows: In November of the
year 1291 "Good Queen Eleanor," as she
was called by her loyal subjects, was
called to join her husband, who was then
making an expedition into Scotland.

When Eleanor had reached as far on
her way as Grantham she sickened
and died. The remains must, of course,
be buried at Westminster, and the funeral
cortege started in that direction. Dur
ing the time this royal funeral proces
sion was slowly winding its weary way
toward the capital thousands of people
nocked to the wayside to get a glimpse of
it. It was a great event in the history of
the rural districts and they did everything
possible to make the solemn occasion a
memorable one. Wherever the procession
halted for the night or for other cause the
people afterward set up a memorial. One
of the longest stops was made at Charing,
and subsequently a richly carved memo
rial cross was erected on the site of the
camp. This was the Charing Cross of
history. It stood until 1047, when the last
vestige of it was destroyed during the
civil wars of Charles I, the vandals who
destroyed the relic claiming it to be a
monument of Popish superstition." Char
ing Cross as seen to-day was erected by
the Southern Railway Company in the
year 1865.â 5t. Louis Republic.

Alligator! Attack a Team.
J. A. Dalton of Barton returned lately
from nis tomato farm, near White Haven, <
and tells a thrilling story of a battle with i
alligators. Dalton's partner, J. B. Lover
ing, drove a wagon, to which two horses
were attached, into Lake Winterset, to fill
some barrels with water. While Lovering j
was at work the horses began to scream in !
mortal agony, and he realized that they
were being attacked by alligators. The j
horses plunged violently, but uoon fell
down, their legs having been broken.
When the horses fell the 'gators rose
and began to tear the bodies of the
animals. Lovering had a Winchester,
and began firing at the 'gators, hoping to
drive them away. The shots, however,
increased the anger of the saurians, and
they made a rush for the wagon and over
turned it. Lovering, holding to the rifle,
fell into the water near a big 'gator, which
immediately made for him. As the
'gator came Lovering thrust the rifle into
its mouth and fired, the bullet inflicting a
[ mortal wound. In his death agony the
saurian swung its tail and knocked Lover
ing out of the water and onto the beach,
twenty feet away. At this juncture Dal
ton arrived and draeged Lovering away,
as the 'gators were again rushing for him.
Assistance was procured and the horses
and wagon pulled out. The horses were
dead, having been horribly maneled by
the 'gators. It is thought Lovering drove
his team into a den of 'gators, judging
i from the number that was seen. â Florida

An Old-Time Doctor.
Dr. Hiram Corson of Philadelphia, who
i has just died, in his ninety-second year,
i was one of tne best-known old-time doctors
jin the country. "For more than sixty
I years," says the Philadelphia Times, "he
j was the presiding genius of the whole
Piymouth region, the guide, philosopher
and friend of everybody, and there prob
ably never was" a man who had
! helped more people into the world,
j though doubtless some have helped
I more out of it. His general family
practice was as successful as it
was extensive, and it is one of the remark
! able things about him that while he never
turned his back on tne accumulated wis
dom of the elders, he was always a pro
gressive doctor. He was one of the most
earnest of the old-time abolitionists, and
one of the most level-headed, so that he
actually accomplished more for humanity
than many that were more heard of. It
was a fine type, that of the old general
practitioner, who joined the rugged man
hood of the country with the learning of
the town, and the university should honor
the memory of Hiram Corson among its
great alumni."
At the Czar's Coronation.
The United States army will be repre
sented at the coronation of the <;zar of
Russia by Major-General A. McD. Me-
Cook, retired, and Captain George P.
Scriven, Signal Corps, military attache of
the United States embassy at Rome. Or
ders to that effect have been issued by the
Secretary of War. It so happens that there
is no military attache at the St. Petersburg
legation at present. General McCook, be
ing a retired officer, under ordinary cir
cumstances could attend the ceremonies
only as a private citizen. His special
designation as a representative or the
United States army, however, will give
him an oiiicial standine and insure him
much greater consideration by the Rus
sian officials than he could otherwise ex
pect. When designated he was in Rome,
but it is understood he is now in PÂ»xia.â

THE LATEST FASHION
GOSSIP FOR
WOMEN AND MEN
LAST Sunday our women were cer
tainly, in most erases, correctly at
tire i, as East it is no longer con
sidered good form to appear in
new hatd or gowns on this joyful
occasion.
Some of the young people have been
Having a gay dancing party this week, and
never were the gowns prettier or fresher,
and I beard some one remark that the
girls who had observed Lent the most
strictly seemed to enjoy the dance the
most. I hear that until the trunks are
packed for the social ball will be kept
roiling.
The very popular bride and groom who
live on the top of a hill are being eener
aily entertained. A large reception and
several dinners will be given this week in
their honor.
There was a large tea in Oakland this
week, and not a few invitations were sent
over here. There was a crowd, so that
means that the affair was a success, and
one matron present I mi-took for one of
the girls, she was so deliciously pretty in
a crisp, cool toilet of lovely pale blue taf
feta. It had little stripes of pink roses and
a dainty bit of a vest. The wearer had
truly wonderful flaxen hair, which was
surmounted by a gold filagree comb; but
tn'en, to be sure, on all sides I heard this
lovely womnn declared to be the most
beautiful woman in Oakland. Another
belle was tastefully attired in a skirt of
heavy white satin, and a Louis XVI coat
of corded silk, embroidered with a small
yellow flower. The gracefully draped vest
was 01 a yellow s-ilk. The stock was of a
shade of green velvet, most becoming, and
a )>;ind nf the same completed the short
elbow puffed sleeves. A piquante brunette
was effective in a corn-colored silk gown,
shot with golden lights and covered with
crimson poppies.
The Colonial Dames held their last
meeting of the season on Tuesday, the
7th in?:., at the hospitable home on one of
the corners of Polk and Geary streets. A
most interesting historical" paper was
delightfully read by the hostess, which
cave rise to many pleasant reminiscences.
Unique and delicious refreshments were
offered the ladiet, one of the courses hav
ing been prepared from a recipe-book pub
A DAINTY BOUSE DRESS.
lished during the seventeentn century.
Almost every Dame was present. This
organization of women is the most ex
clusive in the United States, many of our
most prominent social and literary women
being members.
I regret that the Century Club breakfast
will take place too late for me to tell you
anything about it this week.
On Monday evening I trust the Occi
dental parlor's may be crowded, as sweet
charity asks our aid and an excellent mu
sical programme will be presented.
The Century Club will be the scene of a !
large reception on next Saturday, as the i
membership of Sequoia is large and each !
daughter has three invitations at her dis- ;
posal. Men will not be lacking, so with \
such popular hostesses one of the most j
brilliant events of the season is antici- j
pated.
Wedding-bells will ring right joyfully
for more than one bonnie bride during the
coming week.
Hats and bonnets! I wonder if women
ever really become indifferent to genuine
Parisian conceptions composed of flow
ers and leathers, straw and horsehair,
velvets and ribbons, buckles and pins.
Perhaps the new woman may find noth
ing interetting in an "opening, 1 but the
average woman is quite ready to listen to
any amount of news concerning these in
teresting frivolities, as the most lovely of
toilettes are spoiled unless properly com
pleted by a chic chapeau. One 1 should
not object to owning has a rim wreathed
with violet pansies and a crown covered
with a delicious pleated frill of green tulle,
a mass of violet flowers are beneath the
brim at the back and a violet osprey is at
the left side. Another equally pretty is
made of green straw with a double filling
of shot green silk round the crown, which
is tilled with the most delicate creeper
leaves. This hat has a lining of white
crinoline, and at the back there is a bunch
of white cowslips which rests on the hair.
A hat just designed is of gray straw,
Etriped with very narrow black velvet rib
bons, has a battlemenied brim, and re
minda me of the Henry IV style. The
only trimming consists of white camellias.
A charming little bonnetâ a Paris â has a
crown of white satin, ornamented with an
applique of brocaded flowers upon it,
traced with sequins. A group of black
quiiia set iv a bow of tulle, clasped with a
diamond ornament, forms the sole trim
ming. A bonnet of black straw with a
diadem of emeralds and diamonds and a
group of black and green quills at one
side and a ribbon of a roseate hue tied at
th* back may correctly be called stylish,
as may also a fanciful" black straw, deco
rated with small white straw balls, white
and black feathers nod over the crown. A
single bunch of rich crimson roses give the
needed touch of color, and I must not
forget to tell you that the "Hebe"
toque, when composed of gold straw,
with a black crinkled cnnoline
brim and beautiful with broad bows of
black tulle striped with cold straw and a
black osprey on the left sid^e. is well worth
contemplating. The "Doris" toque, made
of a black fancy chip and crinoline brim is
trimmed in front with rose leaves under
the brim and crushed roses. It is com
pleted by a bow of petunia velvet, which
has hjjrh upstanding ends, but I cannot
yet leave the hats, as the picture ones,
many of them, are appropriately so named.
One of bebe chip has a fold of mignonette
green velvet under the brim and a ban
deaux of roses, a plume of black tips and
another band of velvet round the crown.
Long strings of ribbon velvet the same
sharte of green extend gracefully from the
back.
A Versailles hat wjll probably be re
ceived with even greater favor. It has a
handsome feather mount at one side and
a bow of broad satin ribbon on the oppo
site side. Three handsome tips hang over
the brim.
. A smart cycling hat is to be had in Pan
ama straw. It is trimmed with black vel
vet ribbon and two upstanding quills. A
similar hat was made appropriate for a
young girl's best hat by placing shaded
dark green wings upon it, and a bunch of
delicate roses in shades of pink. While
thinking ofour pretty girls I see that a New
York authority remarks: A pretty hat
easily maae 13 suggested by selecting a
broad brim black tulle frame, covering it
iully with black tulle, and enwreathing it
with brim roses having quantities of lol
iage. Then tie broad tulle bows to stretch
across the hat, turn it up in the back with
tulle pompons and roses. A yet younger
fcirl. if she has a pretty color, will look
well in a white chip hat with a tulle scarf
wound round the brim. At the sides
should be upstanding plisse fans of tulle
and erect among the plisses should be a
bunch of roses.
The Panamas are now much seen and
are of the simplest description; for in
stance, one of brown straw is trimmed
with a black ribbon, three black quills and
a lovely bunch of cowslips. In the hands
of a good milliner these materials are ca
pable of making a stylish if simple hat
which will be useful on many occasions.
A traveling hat, worn by a faultlessly
gowned young matron, was of white twist
straw with a smart bow of black ribbon
velvet at one side, and a ruche of black
tulle surrounding the crown.
It is no easy matter to suggest a satisfac
tory hat for a middle-aged matron, so I
am glad to see the illustration of an excel
lent one. The brim is shallow at the back
and broad iv front, and has a rather tall
crown. This model is carried out in the
new fancy brilliant straw of a Tuscan
color. The brim is lined with black chip,
curving on one side like a Gainsborough,
while the opposite side has a pretty arch
apd droops close over the hair at the back.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 12, 1896.
The trimming is entirely feathers, with an
osprey on one side. Lace or tulle and
ribbons may also be used, but tne feathers,
having a softening effect, are most be
coming.
Straw of a pink shade interplaited with
a narrow straw-colored beading is used for
a youthful hat, which is turned up at the
side, trimmed in the front and back with
honeysuckle and has on either side black
velvet rosettes, an osprey standing directly
in the center in front. This hat is an
Enelish model, for in France foliage is
used only at the back of hats, and in Lon
don, as usual, many floral toques will be
seen this year, for at the leading milliners
already toques composed of tulle and flow
ers are in great demand, and ivy has been
introduced into many of the spring models
with good results. Cowslips are in demand
for the time being. Bonnets having a
small high crown are coming in. Stylish
ones are seen of black and white straw.
A rioh little sackcoat in black poult de
! soie is possessed by one of last season's
debutantes. It has tiny, artistic sleeves, a
yoke richly embroidered in jet, which de
scends in strips to a front' of black ac
cordion pleated chiffon, through which is
seen the silk, which lines this odd gar
ment, ana it is a pink shot giace. A sim
ple cape for this season looks well on a
bright schoolgirl. It is of a line fawn-col
ored cloth, edged with knife plea tings of
changeable green glace silk, which' forms
a ruche around the neck. The lining is of
the same silk. The whale backed short
coat has again appeared and a good one
from a celebrated Louse is of a pale-green
cloth, trimmed and braided front and
back with black braid, and has a well
shaped collar and cuffs of white kid.
For a bride what could be prettier for
evening wear than a cape of miroir velvet
with a rich flounce of old yellow Venetian
lace put on with a ruching'of black chiffon
and further beautified with a wonderful
embroidery of various colors liberally
diamante? The once well-liked pelisse is
coming again into style. One handsome
model just completed for a stylish woman
is of pale yeilow and old ro.se brocade with
stolelike ends of rose-colored velvet with
an applique of yellow guipure. Another of
gray brocade was designed by the same
tirm and is trimmed down the" front with
treble ruchings of accordion-pleated gray
chiffon, and over each shoulder is a stripe
of grebe feathers caught with a bunch of
violets in front and a frill of soft lace. The
collar is a la Marie Antoinette and has
frills of tiny gray feathers.
Grebe makes a beautiful trimming and
I am sure you would all admire a cloak for
evening wear of gray satin, with a scroll
design on violet velvet. Grebe also edges
this garment. The sleeves are of the vio
let velvet. For the same purpose is a
quaint little coat of pearl gray satin, cov
ered with a large Moral design in yellow
and green. The bodire is formed of apiece
of black lace over yellow satin.
A stately grandmother is a picture in a
handsome mantle, in cape form, of black
poult de soie, which is covered with bead
embroidery and an applique of exquisite
guipure. A ruff of black chiffon completes
it, and this is edged with creamy Valen
ciennes.
For this same grandmother has been de
signed a theater wrap of a black brocade,
with bold figures in violet velvet. The
reveres, of the same material, are orna
mented. Two more reveres are of richly
beautiful lace and passementerie. This
entire wrap is lined with a changeable
mauve s;ttin.
One of the simplest and prettiest of
little capes was in one of our store-win
dows to-day. It consists of two pinked
ruffles by changeable blue taffeta silk,
over which were ruffles of knife-pleated
grass cloth, edged with white Valenci
ennes. The grass cloth used was the $1 50
per yard quality. Down the front the
grass cloth was laid in small pleats, two
small buckles apparently holding them in
place on each side. A lace edge ruche of
the grass cloth completed it. iSuch a capo
can very easily be made at home by any
woman at all clever with her needle.
A very excellent gown from the estab
lishment of a well-known English tailor is
made of an olive green face cloth, trimmed
and piped with a turquoise blue under
waistco'at. The front of the bodice is
traced with black and gold braid. The
same design appears on the skirt. The
initiated can understand the perfect suc
cess of this toilet when carried out by an
artist and the fearful looking affair most
tailors would make of it, for alas, artists
are few in number and hard to discover.
Very appropriate for Burhngame would
be a gown from the same establishment of
a drab Scotch tweed which has a touch of
blue in it. The waistcoat is a blue and
white check which repeats the tone of the
tweed.
From Redfern's comes a delightful
model of coarse-grained blue alpaca. The
coat is piped with wnite suede, a belt of
tl^e same being round the waist, the revers
displaying a front of lilac-tinted silk
florally patterned in a Louis Seize design
and striped down the center with a band
of the white suede embroidered in jet and
steel.
Canvas cloths are increasing in popu
larity. A dark blue one has been made
up with an unusually good bodice in the
Russian style of a full, loose, low bodice
over a high one. This one was worked all
over with minute horizontal rows of gray
cord, interspersed with pailettes and beads
in front; at the top of this was a straight
four-inch band of ecru lace, and inside the
neck, forming also the collar-band, was a
brilliant orance and white chine glace
silk; over this the skirt fastened with a
jeweled band. The sleeves are unusually
graceful. Many dressmakers say that the
Kussian blouse will shortly be much worn.
Numerous pretty bodices are being
trimmed with the new silk run lace.
Basques are small and most of the little
frills are edged with narrow black velvet
or ribbon.
Tbe gown I have had our artist copy for
you to-day is made of apple-green glace
nilk with a bodice pointed just below the
waist over a basque of cream-colored lace
of superior detail, the front embroidered
in a wondrous way with pale pink, blue
and green, with the leaves and flowers of
lace. Each side of the skirt is a cascade oj
lace. At the neck is a Medici effect of
collar formed by three tabs on either side,
trimmed with the embroidery and turned
back to show a jabot of lace over pink
chiffon.
Girls with lovely coloring will appre
ciate the description of a gown of cloth of
a pretty color. The skirt is plain lined
with green glace. The bodice is swathed
round the front, and over it falls a square,
bib-like piece of heliotrope velvet, over
which is a piece of beautifully embroid
ered grass lawn. Three small straps of
emerald green satin fastened with diamond
buttons appear at the neck, where there is
draped a collar of grass lawn turned over
with tabs lined with green. The tout en
semble is delightfully springlike and
higniy artistic, but such a gown can only
be successfully carried out by one of the
best of our dressmakers.
The second illustration is of a simple but
elegant gown of lose-colored moire. It
has a yoke effect of white net wonderfully
embroidered in sequins, under which is
white satin. The fashionable sleeves
wrinkle lo the waist. The hair of the
pretty woman represented as wearing this
frock is arranged in the latest style, the
1 ompadour puffs being very becoming to
oval faces.
A slim maiden with fluffy golden hair
will be much admired this summer when
arrayed in a gown of black-striped blue
chine silk. Tne skirt is trimmed with a
fourteen-inch ruffle. The waist has odd,
square-cut revers, which are covered with
black and cream applique lace, and the
vest is of light blue chiffon, accordion
pleated, and is crossed by dainty little
straps of black ribbon, with two good
paste buttons on either side.
A young married woman, with dusky
hairand dark-brown eyes, will emphasize
her charms when arrayed in a dress of
iniroir moire of an odd" shade of apricot.
The skirt is perfect in its absolute sim
plicity, but the bodice is delightfully
elaborate. The sleeves wrinkle to the wrist,
where they are finished with a fall of lace.
The vest is of a lighter shade of apricot
and of chiffon and has on either side straps
of miroir green velvet, which are covered
with the same costly lace which appears at
the wrists. Pine buttons of blue stone are
placed at intervale along the straps. The
A RÂ£CIIERCHE TOILET.
finishing touch is given by a belt of truly
exquisite passementerie.
A gown of soft black broche, with spots
of silver gray, has a skirt with a novel
drapery and a bodice trimmed with tine
black lac-*, and rosettes of black satin rib
bons. This is most appropriate for a ma
tron whose hair is beginning to be touched
with silver.
Smart women will, many of them, in
clude in their summer outfit an eveninc
gown of black and white silk, as they do
not appeal to the taste of ordinary people,
and, as I remarked previously, a skirt of
cream-white mohair, heavy Digue or serge,
will be in great vogue again, and the most
chic of silk bodices and shirtwaists will be
worn with them. Speaking of shirts re
minds me that one of the favorites is com
posed of the finest linen lawn, embroid
ered by hand, with a small turned-down
collar at the neck; the cuffs match the
collar, all being edged with a small frill of
real Valenciennes Jace. These shirts may
be had in all of the new and delicate
shades and cost |15, as the insertions
used are of unusual fineness and are intro
duced with excellent effect. The grass
linen shirt with frills of itself, lace edged,
is not to be despised.
The Spanish flounce is to be much u-?ed
on our petticoats and organdy skirts.
Such skirts should not be gored at all, so
that they may be drawn with cords for a
distance below the waist or pressed into
side pleats the entire length of the back
widths. This produces an excellent effect,
but the skirt must be pressed each time it
is worn.
Elbow sleeves will be the rule for ail but
street gowns. Beige grass linen is becom
ing to almost ail complexions, so large
quantities are being sold, and for warm
weather it is much lighter and more com
fortable than the heavier linen twills
Such frocks are simply and daintily
trimmed with many yards of lace and rib
bons.
This season collets or short collars differ
from those of last by being much more
elaborately and beautifully trimmed.
Felix is making up some that add a
greater luster than ever to his name.
I wonder if the little girls ever think I
do not write about their frocks frequently
enough. Well, at all events, I think
about you all very frequently, and to-day
I want you to read these few lines from
Vogue, as they so nicely express just what
Iwished tp speak about this week. In
New York such a gown would cost $13 50,
but if you mane it at home it will be much!
less expensive.
"A most exquisite little frock is made of
plain twine-colored batiste. The batiste
is laid in a broad box pleat in the middle
of the bodice in front, either side of the
pleat bordered with very line Swiss em
broidery of a lacy pointed" pattern. From
the shoulder, either side of the embroidery
runs a black velvet ribbon to the waist,'
where it is ended with a full rosette of the
embroidery. There is a large pearl button
in the center of the rosette. Around the
high standing collar at the neck the velvet
nbbon is loosely laid, and the embroidery
turns back over the velvet in a loose
collar."
Many mothers complain about the chil
dren s dresses shrinking and losing their
color In the first place cotton goods
should always be shrunk before they are
cut out and in the second place 'it is
cheaper in the end to purchase expensive
materials, well dyed, and send them to a
good laundry if you cannot have them
done up at home. Blue washes better than
pink and I have seen a dear little frock of
pa]e-green French chintz which has been
many times in the washtub without becom
ing more than half a shade pnler. It has a
deep collar of white muslin edged with
lace, and two rows of insertion make it
one of the daintiest of garments.
Cheviot is quite a favorite material
for very active young ones, as it is so
stout and strong. Gingham will always
be useful, and a pink one with a little
black thread has three pieces of white in
sertion down the front laid over black
satin ribbon. A black ribbon encircles the
waist, and two frisky bows are perched on
the shoulders. The short puffed sleeves
have a similar band of insertion. A small
but very plump little daughter looks re
markably well in this dress.
The fichu continues to flourish greatly,
and I thoroughly recommend using mous
seline de soie instead of silk mull, or
chiffon, that is, if expense is any object;
as, if you pay $1 50 per yard for the raous
seline de soie.it will stand cleaning; in
fact, it will also look fresb for a longer
time than either of the other fabrics, but
the mull and chiffon look like a rag very
quickly, and thus far I have not found
any means of renovating them.
femall Dresden buttons, displaying ex
quisite flowers, are to be seen on many
stylish summer costumes. Now that
there is such a rage for delft china I ex
pect to see delft buttons; in fact, I am
surprised that I have not yet heard of their
appearance.
There is a decided tendency shown to
overtrim hats, especially the "large ones,
which should most emphatically be
fought, as no matter how perfectly a
woman may otherwise be clad a topheavy
appearance spoils the tout ensemble com
pletely, and as we must wear our hats as
far over the iforehead as possible, this ap
pearance is hard to avoid. However,
after we have worn our hats well forward
for a while the trimming will be better
understood.
Wise young women have ceaseil to wear
dowdy dresses when receiving at teas,
comprehending that a perfectly fresh,
crisp muslin is preferable to a soiled satin.
As a result most of the girls look unusu
ally fetching, even when only women are
invited, for women dress quite as much for
each other as for the approval of the other
sex.
White gloves are vanishing, excepting
for evening wearâ fashionable calls. One
of the poorest economies in the world is to
purchase so-called cheap gloves, for, to
quote a remark Charles Kingsley made
about something else, they are * "cheap
and nasty." Marcella.
TOE MEN.
If a black cutaway is not desired a brown
or gray is stylish for semi-morning wear.
An excellent suit can be made from plaid
in which gray and black are the keynote,
with just a thread of red running through
the symphony. Scotch goods or cheviots
should be selected, as never have we had a
more excellent selection to choose from.
Trousers are being cut straight with a
sprint bottom, but they must not be too
full, and $15 should not be grudged for a
well-made pair.
White waistcoats should only be worn
in the evening and white gloves with
black stitching have never been worn in
the streets in this country, although they
have been by extremists, as a fad, in botn
London and Paris, but our men have had
the good sense to wear them with their
frock coats at afternoon weddings only.
Sack coats should never be made with a
fly front, as fashionable men will not wear
them.
Waistcoats are to be made moderately
high.
More gray and checked cloths are being
imported than any other kinds, and some
tailors have not yet relinquished the idea
that they can eventually persuade men of
fashion shortly to appear ia snuff-colored
frock coats.
It ia a positive fact that among the pat
terns of linens for shirts just recived in
New York there is one of "a dim green
with pink stripes and at intervals large
yellow roses." It seems impossible that
any one would wear such a design. "It re
cajls," as Him says, "one of the hideous
old wallpapers which used to disfigure our
grandparents' rooms," and this authority
says that for his part he intends to select
"tne dark marine blues, the vivid cinna
mon pinks and the deep lilacs in stripes,
and these colored backgrounds with rJeur
de-lys upon them; or, again, a few of
white, on which are sprayed dainty
bunches of forget-me-nots or simple

tiny garland of coral." Now, all such
things are matters of taste, but assuredly
1 will never be seen groing around with
forget-me-nots wandering over my manly
chest, and the new greens and yellows I
will carefully avoid, and then there are be
ing shown East some absolutely absurd
patterns also for shirts in tartan plaids.
"Him" remarks: "I am told by the high
English authorities that the London man
intends returning to the flower-pot silk
hat, such as we sometimes meet in Leech's
sketches, or again, see on the boulevards
of the other side of the Seineâ those ot the
Latin quarter. Shall we all resemble these
queer French artists, who are very pic
turesque with the Luxembourg and its
stiff gardens and rectangular beauties for
a background. Ido not wish to look as if
I came from an insane poster. In the
United States the Dunlap hat has a very
narrow brim and a somewhat bell-shaped
crown. The brim is curled a little. The
Derbies are low in the crown and brown in
color. The radius of the straw hat at this
early season has not yet been determined "

BAB DISCUSSES DRESSES
The Colors and Shades the
Blondes and Brunettes
Should Wear.
PALE BLUE FOE DARK WOMEN.
The Sweet Rcss Pink Is for the
Golden-Haired and Gives Them
Lovely Color.
NEW YORK, April 7, 1896. â There
was no doubt about it. She was an
artist in dressmaking. But unfortunate
ly for the rest of the world she had in
some way or another inherited millions,
so that she was not a dressmaker, and
could oniy give her friends advice. Most
of them listened and refused to accept it.
I am among the few who appreciate her.
So, when I said "white," she looked at me
and answered: "On you? With your
pale face? Never, unless you nave it in
some soft, woolen stuff, which will seem to
drape you and make soft folds, forcing the
white "to seem caressing, whereas if it were
in silk or satin you would appear like a
frightened corpse chasing around in search
of your past sins. Women don't consider
fabrics enough; they seem to think that if
they get a color that is becoming nil is at
tained; and yet, take a stout woman and
put her in black satin â she looks three
times her 196 pounds. Put her in black
cashmere, or black cloth, properly made,
and you speak of her as plump, and won
der that anybody ever called her fat.
"Then there is blue â people have an
idea that every young girl can wear it. It
makes the dainty blonde maiden, who
ought to look like one of Watteau's young
women â and they are, always excepting
their waists, perfect representatives of
health â look like a frozen lady, a iady who
might have been picked up at the "north
pole. Here there is no cjuestion of fabric;
pale blue belongs exclusively to the bru
nette. It has a curious way, even if the
brunette has a sallow skin, of making that
skin look less sallow and more olive.
Pink, the veritable sweet rose color, fades
when it is put on a brunette. From the
color standpoint, she is too strong for it,
while on the blonde it retains all its own
beauty, makes her cheeks glow, brings out
the gold of her hair, while the blue of her
eyes by contrast, match the June sky.
You are the type that want red â brilliant,
glowing red. Not crimson, not purplish
red, but the clear, bright red that is always
the envy of the Quakeress. A bit of it in
your hat makes your eyes brighter, makes
your dull hair glossier, and shed's, uncon
sciously, a shadow of itself on your pale
checks. The average woman doesn't value
red as she should. There ought to be a set
of red rosettes in the chest of drawers in
every woman's dressing-room, for there
always comes a day when she needs them.
"Black? Black, like white, is the refuge
of the aillicted, and yet, bow smart a black
tailor-made gown is! How elegant a black
velvet dinner dress is! And how beauti
ful a black tulle, spangled with gold be
comes when it is worn by the belle of the
ball ! 1 have never been able to agree with
the elder Worth in his dislike of black,
lie claimed that black in bringing out
beauties also brought out defects, and
that elderly women who wore it simply
intensified their lack of youth and the
number of their wrinkles.
l 'Oh,yt's; I remember very well when
you wrote and asked him to send you a
black dinner dress. And there arrived a
black satin, elaborate with rosettes and
trimmings, that shaded from rose pink to
deep magenta. And you wept. And wept
bitterly. And wore the frock but once,
and felt the night you wore it that if it had
been a rippling stream, near some town,

R. T. KENNEDY COMPANY.
you would have been damned by all thosa
who had to endure it. Then you did a
very wise thing. You had all the trim
ming taken off, and cast the bodice, garish
with crimson, to one side. There was
made for you a black broadcloth train
which contrasted magnificently with
the satin sides and front, and to
go with this there was a bodice
composed partly of broadcloth and
partly of satin, with sleeves of satin,
crossed by bands of jet; just such a sleevo
as Marguerite of Valoise wore. Ihere
Worth made one of his mistakes. Black
is becoming to some women, but unfortu
nately early in his working days this artist
in dressmaking saw what is known as 'the
best black silk' of an American woman,
and lie shuddered. It was coarse of grain
and scant of skirt; it was titled so that the
lack of bust was conspicuous and tha
sleeves were so tight that an easy move
ment of either arm was impossible. He
told me this himself, so I never blamed
him for not wanting to send black
dresses to American women; but remem
ber always what I say that whether
you are young or old, slender or
stout there are wonderful possibilties
in black, provided always you choose the
right fabric and then dispose of your ma
terial properly. 1 remember once when
I was in a fashionable tailor-shoo I met
Mrs. Embonpoint, who is a great friend of
mine; she said: "Oh, my dear, aren t
these tailor-made gowns fine? These per
fectly simple gowns mean so much to the
women who are inclined to be stout. And
I looked at her with dismay. The woman
who had made her stays culled her
in at the waist and so forced the extra
llesh to go above and below the waist
line in a way that was not artistic, and,
although the tailor did not want to do it,
she insisted on having a plain, close-nttin(j
skirt and an equally plain bodice. And
the result? Well, the result was that all
the fat was brought out to advantage, to
doubtful advantaee, where a few folds ol
the material might have hid it, and be
tween staymaker and her own lack of
artistic dressing, Mrs. Embonpoint looked
more like the minute glass with which I
time my eggs at breakfast than a well
shaped woman. And, my dear, with this
she was going to wear one of those new
hats wreathed with roses! And nature
gave her a long nose!
"You know one of those poke-over hati
worn by a woman with a long nose make 9
her look like the essence of curiosity in
feminine form. A hat tilted way over the
face has a reason for existence; but it is
for the girl with the over-high forehead or
the tip-tilted nose, and every other type
should let it severely alone." Bab.

CHICAGO, iT.t,, April 11.â Government's
estimate en winter wheat, 77.1 per cent, was con
sidered bullish, and on the curb yesterday prices
advanced over a cent above where they closed.
This tnorning the opening was from G/fec to %c
above yesterday's final official Quotations, but the
crowd was not in an ecstacy over the outlook, the
knowledge that since April 1 the weather has been
more favorable to the plant tnan previous to that
time, tending to curb enthusiasm â¢ neendered by
the Agricultural Department's statement. Argen
tine shipments for the week were 904,000 bush
els, which rather contradicted the claim that tne
exportable surplus of that country was about ex
haus'ed. Exports of wheat and flour .rom both
coasts for the week were light at 1,764,000 bush
els. Northwestern receipts showed an iucreasc,
434 cars arriving, against 475 for two days last
week and S6 a year ago. Liverpool cables were
firm and Vb<3 to A higher. Private advices, how
ever, reporting ihe advance are not sustained. Re
ceipts at Chicago were 11 cais. aud 148.400 bush
els Â«ere taken trom store. Aft< r the early strength
abated offerings beer.me free and prices gradually
receded, tinallv developing decided weakness and
breaking rapidly, until they were 23,4 c below the
openinc, which was also the outside for the day.
Closing Continental cables were generally higher.
Export clearances at Atlantic ports for 24 hours
asuregated 327.863 bushels. May wheat opened

thai RTa'n. with the business at no time becoming
large enough to attract attention or cause com
ment. Receipts were 162 c.'.rs, and 48.151 bnnlifls
were withdrawn from store. Liverpool cables
were quiet and unchanged. Argentine shipments
of corn for the week amounted to 760,000 bushels,

WOOLâ The circular of Jacob Wollner says:
"Tbe arrivnls of wool lv this market to date, in
cluding 1600 bales from Nevada, amount to 10,120
bales. It is remarkable that although the Eastern
markets are reported dull and quiet, with prices. if
any one wants to buy, in buyer's favor, 2500 bales
of wool have been sold in this market. Thf> stocks
on hand oi domestic and foreign wool in Eastern
markets are reported to be enormous, there being
1-^5,000,000 pounds more than at this time last
year." We Quote Spring: Nevada. 7Â®By*c:

day, some stocks being firmer and others weaker,
the latter, however, predominating. Trading was
quiet.
The Peg. Belcher assessment falls delinquent in
otlice to-morrow.
An official telegram received yesterday- reports
an increased output of ore from the Consolidated
California and Virginia mine. The yield last week
was 144 tons, against 122 tons for the previous
week, and th" average assay of the same was
$51 45 per ton, against R53 18 per ton for the pre
vious w-fek. A working week on the Corn-nook
now consists of six days, as all the mines ou the
main iode are closed on Sundays.
The Cold .MinriÃ Exchange has listed another
proper! vâ the LocKwood Consolidated goldmine of
West I'oTnt, Calaveras County. President Turn

Culture Of The
Sugar-beet
In California
THAT the sugar-beet is destined
to be an important factor in build
ing up the prosperity of Califor
nia is a fact about which there are
now no doubts. To all careful ob
servers who are well informed on the sugar
industry it is evident that the beet â will, in
the very near future, rank with fruit and
grain in the development of the agricul
tural interests of the State. Its culture's
now, more than ever before, attracting the
attention of farmers, manufacturers and
capitalists. Its prospects are alluring and
are becoming better understood, and as
the industry thus grows in popularity its
progress cannot be retarded throughout
the State.
Ihe farmer who has lost heart in grow
ing wheat and still retains misgivings as
to the future of fruit rinds himself deeply
interested in the culture of beets. In
many instances the farmer, desirous of a j
mote complete knowledge of the soil, 1
turns to the Mii:ur-beet. with faith in its
bountiful return for his lahor and invest
ment. As a rule, however, he is but half
informed upon the question. The result
is constant inquiry from all direitions,
but more particularly from the districts
supposed to be adapted to beet culture.
The problems contained in the^e inquiries
liave excited a widespread inteiest, as they
include the questions of suitability of soil, |
treatment of the beet in its varioiis stages j
and the benelits to be derived from the
business.
As a general proposition H may be stated
that California is superior to all* the other
States as a Jand for the production of the
eugar beet. Chauncey Depew remarked j
only a few days ago that "California was i
noted far and near for her beets," and he
then expressed something of the State's
reputation.
"California is ahead of them all," was
the positive way in which C. A Granger,
an authority on sugar-beet culture, re
plied to a query calling for comparison
with Virginia, Nebraska and Utah. ''Next
to Southern California, or perhaps equal
to it, are the Sacramento and San Joaquin
valleys. The beets tLat were grown there
in the early days were equal to those grown
In the South. The rainy season comes in
at the right time for getting an early stand
for the beets, and then your dry season
comes in at the right time to not interfere
with the ripening, and the strength of tne
beet is not washed out by the rainÂ«>. In j
. other words, there is no part of this country
that furnishes the advantages that Central
and Southern California do for beet-rais
ing.'
Mr. Home, manager of the Grand Island
and Norfolk sugar factory, said in a recent
interview:
"You know my interests are all in this
country, but to be candid California fur
nishes the best territory for the raising of
beets on the western continent. From my
investigations in California, Utah and Ne
braska I am convinced that the farmers of
California have a great field in sugar-beet
growing.
"I think wnen they study the question
and know what can be done their land will
be more valuable for beet-growinp than
ever it was for wheat or than it can be for
fruit, unless there is a different arrange
ment than there is at the present time for
handling fruit in tlie cities East. If Cali
fornia should have 200 beet-sugar factories
the size of those at Chino and Watsonville
they could not furnish a quarter of the
tÂ«ugar that is shipped from the Eastern
countries to the United States."
These statements represent the convic
tions of experts in beet-sugar culture and
manufacture, ana are therefore the best
evidence that could be offered to prove the
comparative superiority of California as a
producer of the eugar-beet.
It is only now, however, that prospects
for a general inauguration of this industry
throuehout the great interior valleys
eeems reasonably certain. Watsonville
began with a factory in 1890, having a
â capacity of about 300 tons, and each year
the capacity has been increased until now
et least 800 tons of sugar-beets are treated
daily. The farmers were slow to move in
â the new industry, but the profits from I
raising beets have been so ruuch more
than those of grain or fruit culture that
applications nowadays to the factory far
exceed the capacity. Grain-sowing other
than for home use is almost abandoned
and fruit-planting is limited except wnere
beets and orchards are grown together. In
the vicinity of the other factories a pre
. vailing air of prosperity made apparent in
the comfortable homes and the happy
-people tells its own story.
The question has been asked as to the
number of acres necessary to be planted to
support the establishment of a beet-sugar
factory. About 30.000 acres would be ttie
requisite number. Not that a factory
would consume the annual product of
that acreage, but rather about one- third of
that.
The requisition for threefold the capacity
of a factory is made upon the proposition
that in order to keep the land in a pro
ductive state it must be changed at least
once in three years from beet planting to
that of some cereal suitable to the charac
ter of the soil.
This would naturally lead to the con
clusion that the sugar-beet is destructive
to coil. Professor Hilgard of the Univer
sity of California in a lecture on crops and
fertilizers gave the following interesting
information on the subject, as deduced
from scientific investigations:
Next comes the sugar beet, in which so many
are interested now, and which you may tnke
88 representing the root crops in general.
Here we have first, in contrast with wheat and
its iMiJ pounds of ash for the total plant, not
iess than 1350 pounds of ash taken from one
ncre, and if we include the 172 of nitrozen,
over three-fourths of a ton of total soil ingre
dients, when the whole plant is removed. It
Is true that tins totÃl comes down to less than
iJSO pounds if we leave the leafy tops in tue
field ; yet the roots alone remove twenty times
as much poiash as does wheat, three times as
much phospnoric acid. Rnd considerably over
twice as much nitrogen. This is an
enormous draft as compared with any
of these other crops, especially ofi
potash; hut phosphoric acid and nitrogen are
also drawn upon quite heavily. You will ob
serve ttiat the draft of beets on all the sub
ttanrps is Marcely approached by any crops in
the table, except alfalfa and ramie. But note,
niso, that the sugar, the commercially salable
part of the beet crop, consists of nothing that
la in this table at ail; like the oil of the olive,
it comes entirely from the air; and the rest
can be given back to the laud, 'ihe sugar-beet
weed not, therefore, be an exhaustive crop nt
all, provided you return all the offal, which
can be done without special difficulty.
The very important question which next
arises, Does beet raising pay? is answered
with figures, the result oi careful and in
telligent experiments and actual culture
on a large scale. Reports from Watson
ville, CaL, show that for 1891 the average
Yield per acre for beets was between thir
teen and fourteen tons, and the average
price paid $T> per ton. The cost of produc
tion, not including rent of land, was from
$26 to $40 per acre. It was considered that
the average net profit per acre was not less
than $30. Statistics from Alvarado for the
same year show the average yield to have
been nfteeM tons per acre, and the average
price pnf'd per ton $5. The cost of produc
tion was estimated at $4<i per acre, thus
leaving a net profit per acre of $2ii.
The latest statistics are those from H.
P. Dyer, a local expert, who presents these
figures for each acre, assxiining that the
farmer can buy good land near the fac
tories for $125 an acre, and that other ex
penses would bring the amount to $175:

â  The experience of beet-growers on the
Chino ranch has been submitted on more
than one occasion as proof of what farmers
have done in raising beets.
E. M. Day, living a mile and a half from
Chino, planted 25?Â£ acres, from which ne
harvested 409 tona, which realized $1400.
lie paid $40 for wages and $75 for seed and
use of a cultivator.
N. S. Rice harvested 201 tons net from
sixteen acres. At $5 06 a ton he received
$81G 52, or $51 04 per acre. He paid out for
raising and harvesting seed $57, thinning
I $54; plowing and planting $30; top Ding
; $101, total $242. All the rest of the work
was done by himself, so his net profits on
sixteen acres were $574 52.
A. L. Cavanaugh harvested ten acres,
from which he got 22 tons, or 220 tons of
16 per cent beets. Sixteen per cent beets
brought $5 10 a ton, making the receipts
$1122, or $112 20 an acre.
The?e are taken at random from an
array of instances wherein farmers have
found beet-growing decidedly remunera
tive.
As an instance of wnat a 334-ton plant
means for a neighborhood, the Sacramento
Industrial Improvement Association gives
the following concise statement:
Totalsâ Seventy-seven men during factory
campaign, $21,018; 4.i men employed by the
year, $45,600. Total paid iv wages at factory,
$t>G,t>7B.
To produce 40.080 tons of beets, sufficient for
120 days' campaign, assuming that the farmer
produces 12 tons to the acre, which only runs
14 per cent saccharine matter, they will have
co>t to raise $2 07 per tou. Actual" cost of la
bor, i?l 50 per ton; seed, $2 16 per acre, 18
cents per ton; rent of land, $10 per acre, 83J^
cents per ton; delivery to factory, 50 cents per
ton; interest on farming tools, etc., 5>C cents
per ton; total cost per ton of beets, '"s2 07;
40,080 multiplied by ,f2 07 equals $82,905 60;
total lubor account, about $150,000. To this
you can add 20,000 tons lone coal at $1 75,
$35,000; 283 tons coke from your gas com
pany at $3, $2304; 2400 tons lime rock from
Folsom at S2, $4800; total, $42,104.
. A sum of $200,000 is not far from what a fac
tory would pay out to labor for a capacity treat
ing 334 tons of beets each day for 120 days.
I'erhaps it would be well to consider how
much profit there would be to the producers of
these beets. Forty thousand and eighty tons
at $3 50 per ton for 12 per cent beets, and 40
cents for each 1 per cent thereafter would be
$4 30 a ton or a clear prolit to the raiser of
$2 23 a ton, after paying $10 an acre rent for
his land. On the year's crop there would be
$89,398 40 in profit to the farmers.
On au average 1 find that one man attends
ten acres of beets, and the average for each ten
acres is three persons, making about 1000 in
habitants sustained directly by a 334-ton fac
tory.
With this information in his possession,
the farmer who wishes to improve his con
dition may go ahead without fear of fail
ure after he has examined seriously the
instructions for planting and raising sugar
beets. The very clear and direct advice
issued by the sugar companies as follows
contain all the data necessary for the suc
cessful cultivation of the beet:
Plant a space sixty-six feetsquareâ one-tenth
of an acre.
Keep all stock off the land after the rain be
gins.
Plow deep, break up thoroughly, pulverize
the soil before planting.
Sow when the soil is warm, after the rainsâ
say in April or M ay.
One pound of seed will seed one-tenth of an
acre.
Sow in rows eighteen to twenty-one inches
apart.
Sow with a drill, forced feed; bow shallow,
just deep enough to be covered.
Seed should come up in seven to twenty-one
days.
Thin the beets as soon as they develop four
I leaves. *
Thin out from six to ten inches, according to
richness of soil.
Leave only one beet in one place, and that
| the most vigorous one.
Keep weeds out entirely.
Do not ailow a crust to form on the top of the
i land after seeding or while beets are growing.
Continue to keep the soil loose by drawing a
! cultivator between the rows until the tops
i cover the ground.
Beets should ripen in from 120 days to 1(50
j dnys from time of seeding.
When the outer leaves turn yellow and die
1 down it is an indication thai the beets are
i ripening or ripe.
To Eet a proper sample dig two or three rows
in different parts of the field. Sort them into
three sizesâ large, medium Rnd smallâ and
i lake every twentieth beet at random from the
three piles.
.Sample should contÃln 20 to 25 beetÃ.
Do not cut the tops off with a knife, but
twist the leaves off.
.Ship in sacks as soon as possible after dig
ging.
Mark each sack plainly with name and ad
dress of raiser; send duplicate shipping re
ceipt and letter containing full particulars, by
mail, stating yield in pounds of the tenth of
acre seeded.
With regard to harvesting the beet it has
been learned that hill land boots ripen iirst
and other kinds of land can keep up a suc
cesMon of rich beets during the months
following. In the Pajaro Valley the har
vest is practically limited by the winter
rains which come some time in October or
November and render the roads impassable.
This diflicnlty is partially overcome by
hauling in then all the outstanding crop
and storing it in the factory bins. Beets
at that time of the year, if in pood condi
tion and carefully handled, will keep for
eight weeks. Sugar beets in the Pajaro
Valley show little or no external sign by
which maturity can be known for a cer
tainty. The color of the leaves is an un
reliable index, and the best or rather the
only certain guide is the analysis of the
root.
When ripe, beets should be at once
plowed up, topped and hauled to the mill.
The beet is now highest in saccharine

matter and in purity, and it is to the com- j
mon interest of farmer and manufacturer :
to have them harvested and milled as '
soon as possible.
Harvesting may be divided into three
operations: Plowing out, topping and
hauling. Plowing is performed by a
specially made plow which does not, how
ever, need description as it is merely an
adaptation of the best plow used in Europe.
It is very cheap and saves an immensity
of labor; a man and two horses should
plow out one and a half to two acres per
day. The beets after this plowing are
left standing nprignt, but quite loose, in
the ground. They are pulled up, shaken
free from dirt, tnrown into rows or piles,
topped by hand with a sharp knife and
thrown into baskets ready to be linally
loaded into wagons and hauled to the
factory.
Topping is at present the most expen- I
sive operation, and costs on an average
7.3 cents per ton.
Beets should be hauled to the factory im
mediately after topping, as they rapidly
deteriorate upon exposure to our hot sun.
If they cannot be hauled at once, they
should be well covered with leaves. A
single day's exposure to the hot sun will
make an appreciable difference in both
quality and quantity. Beets thus exposed
become flabby, and instead of crisp, brittle
roots, they are tough, and can be tied into
a knot without breaking.
Danger from frost in this climate is very
slight.
Beets are bulky, and the cost of hauling
is a considerable item of expense. Within
a radius of three miles from the factory it
varies from 25 cents to 50 cents per ton , and
from three to six miles from 50 cents to
$1 50 per ton. As this is about the limit
that can be paid for hauling, it naturally
restricts the best growing area of a mill
without railroad facilities to about one
hundred square miles.

AGAINST THE DIRECTORS.
The Safe Deposit's Hand in the
People's Home Bank
Litigation.
MISMANAGEMENT IS ALLEGED
j The Board is Said to Be Careless and
Negligent, and Unfit for
Office.
The California Safe Deposit and Trust
Company has thrown a bombshell into
the litigation which is pending around the
People's Home Savines Bank. It is the
assignee of over $700,000 worth of claims,
and as such assignee it has brought suit to
have summoned S. K. Thornton, Eugene
j M. Freeman, William H. Pbelps, John F.
Sheehan, George Stone and William P. Tay
lor, all directors of the People's Home Sav
ings Bank.
The actual amount of assigned claims
represented by the California Safe Deposit
and Trust Company was $722,972 28, and
this amount included the claims of 2657
depositors, but there has been paid to the
account of these claims, $108,445 "84, leaving
an unpaid balance of $614,526 44.
The complaint alleges that the directors
complained of have been guilty of crimi
nal carelessness and negligence in the ad
ministration of the affairs of the bank.
The plaintiff alleges that an inspection of
the books was refused, although several
times demanded, nor could any satisfac
tion be got from them until the aid of the
court was called into the case. The direc
tors have refused to call in the \mpaid
capital stock upon demand, and their
records are not properly kept, continues
the complaint, and if left in power the ob
noxious directors will delay and impede
such a course as much as possible. It is
also alleged that transfers of stock from
solvent transferors to insolvent transfer
ees was also made with the idea of defeat
ing the claims of the bank creditors.
The complainant further alleges that
Stone, Thornton and Sheehan on July 15,
1895, decided that it would be for their
best interests individually to procure the
resignation of Merrell, a director, and
elect a director who would favor their
projects and plans, and who would oppose
ttie calling in of the unpaid capital of said
savings bank and impede its collection.
Accordingly they caused Phelps to make
a proposition to Merrell, to the effect that
he should purchase the said claim of Mer
rell against the savings bank, and that
Phelps should pay Merrell a sum of money
largely in excess of the real value of his
claim. This proposition was coupled with
the condition that Merrell should resign
his office as a director of the bank, and
with the further condition that in the
event that Stone and Thornton should fail
to elect him a director that any money
paid to Merrell should be relumed and re
funded to him. and that a re-assignment
should be made to Merrell of his claim
against the bank.
Merrell assigned his claim to Phelps and
delivered to Phelps his resignation as a
director. Then Phelps caused Merrell to
leave the City temporarily in order that
he might not attend the meeting of the
board of directors, which was to be held
July 24, 1895, and in order that Merrell
might not reconsider his action and with
draw his resignation.
Men ell's resignation was accepted by the
votes of Davidson, Stone, Thornton and
Johnson, and Phelps was elected a director

money, much of which went to himself.
T. Carl Spelling is also criticized for a sum
he drew, because it is charged that it was
largely in excess of what he deserved.
Concluding, the complaint says there
are nineteen more suitb now pending, in
volving an amount of about $200,000, which
need the attention and direction of a
competent attorney, and it is alleged that
in this time of need the true reason
for dispensing with the services of John
Flournoy was that he was faithful to his
duties in prosecuting the suits of the
stockholders, and in enforcing the de
mands of the bank.
It is further alleged that Sheehan is in
receipt of a salar}- of $175 a month, and
that the amount is far beyond what he
earns. That he is devoting much of his
time to the Cripple Creek Development
Company, an association in which both
Stone and Thornton are interested, and
that he is neglecting his duties as secre
tary and manager of the bank.
The complaint concludes as follows:
Wherefore, complainant alleges that the
said Eugene M. Freeman, William P.
Taylor, George Stone, W. H. Phelps, S. K.
Thornton and John F. Sheehan, and
each of them, are not the proper
persons to be intrusted with the clos
ing of the affairs and business of said
People's Home Savings Bank in the in
terest of the depositors, creditors and
stockholders thereof, and respectfully
prays said honorable court that an order
be made to show cause in the above
entitled action why the said Eugene M.
Freeman, Georee Stone, William P. Tavlor,
S. K. Thornton and William H. Ptielps
should not be removed from the office of
diieclors of said bank, and why the said
George Stone should not be removed from
the office of president of st>id savings bank,
and why the said John F. Sheehan should
not be removed from the office oi secretary
and manager thereof, and further prays
that at the time fixed for the hearing of
said order said court make an order re
moving the said Eugene M. Freeman,
George Stone, William P. Taylor, S. K.
Thornton, William H. Phelps and John F.
Sheehan from the offices held by them,
and that said court make such other and
further order in the premises as it may
deem fitting and proper.
OCEAN VIEW COURSING.
Sixteen Does Will Compete for the
Frizes in To-Day's Stake.
To-day's coursing at Ocean View will
begin with a sixteen-dog stake, in which
some of the best dogs of this City are en
tered. Following is the result of the
drawing:
Villa kennel's Electric vs. C. B. Wood's Lady-
Byron; J. Quane's Cuptain Morse vs. P. Ryan's
Magpie; J. O'Connor's True Blue vs. J. Bax

son's Last Chance vs. C. Coop's California Vio
let; W. I). Murphy's Cottage Boy vs. W. D.
Murphy's Lord Clifton.
In case the regular stake is decided early
enough a consolation stake will be run.
One Day's Grace.
Although the notable introductory dis
tribution of that great reference library,
the New Encyclopaedic Dictionary, wsÂ»a an
nounced to close yesterday, the syndicate
has, for reasons explained, decided to al
low one day's grace, thus extending the
time of closing to Monday night, at 10
o'clock.
The fact is there are always those who
defer even what they know to be a duty to
themselves and families. This is espe
cially true of busy men, and will apply in
this notable instance. Many others, es
pecially ladies, were doubtless deterred by
the threatening weather. In justice to
those who really meant to apply in time,
but could not, and to accommodate others
who, for good cause, have been thus far
prevented from calling, orders which will
be sent any time before Monday night at
12 o'clock will be received and tiled.
