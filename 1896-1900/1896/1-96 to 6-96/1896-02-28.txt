cause of Cuban independence had strong
advocacy and support in the Senate to-day
in a speech of fervid and impassioned
eloquence' delivered by . Senator Vest of

of "the Senate he was struck with the argu
ment-which Washington felt himself"com
pelled to make in defense of his proclama
tion of neutrality in 1788. In all the life
of that great roan there had been no
episode more Btartliug and interesting
than the issuance .â :' that proclamation of
neutrality declaring that the people of the
"Tnited States would remain neutral in the
s:ruggle between France and the com
bined armies of Europe.
"France, 1 " Vest continued, "witn a dis
interestedness which has put a debt of un
dyiue gratitude upon us and our children,
had sent her armies and rleets to help us
in our struggle with England. But when
Tiie continental armies combined against
France, when the soldiers of France nad
marched across the Continent fighting a
Wor] i in arm?, with a flag on which was
inscribed, 'Death to tyranny and 'liberty

dollar '<.*â  send :i man to assist our former
allies, although England headed the com
bination against republican France.
Washington was right; and his ereatness
was never so much demonstrated as when
â  nd ajainst popular clamor in the
United States and declared that we
never could c nfe!y vary from the great
di rtrine of absolute neutrality in tiie
aftairs and wars of Europe.
'Lf we mean to stanl by these people in
(ha, who are imitating us and are en
deavoring to make a Government for
themselves, we must nelp them in their
hour of need. I do not go so far as to say
ttiat we should do so by arms, That is
not advocated by any one in Oils chamber
or out of it. We can at least do it by
stating to the world that we believe the
attempt of this monarchy of Spain to sup
press the insurrectionâ the attempt to
form a republic in the Island of Cubaâ is
absolutely hopeless and helpless, as I
believe under God it is to-day. Never will
come an hour when Spain can reassert her
dominion over the Island of Cuba. It is
impossible for her to do it. I take the
great teachings of history and experience.
"The course of Spain on this continent
iÂ« marked with blood. There was a time
when Spanish dominion extended from
the southern limits of theilÂ»ited States to
ttie most southerly po)/t of South
America. No American can ever forget
those burning pages of Prescott which
described the conquest of Mexico anil
Peru, when the Spaniards, with the lust of
gold and the lust of Dlood. marked their
terrible pathway across those countries.
Of all that va^t dominion, won by hlood,
won through torture and fire, there remains
to-day to that toothless old wolf the single
i-.;md of Cuba; and Spain to-day, like
Giant Despair, in that wonderful picture of
Bonyati's/sita almost helpless at the door
uf the dark cave of despotism, and grins
with impotent ra*re at the procession of
splendid republics that march on in the
I'rogress of civilization and the future.
"Mr. President, that wolf can never re

all these South Amcriean provinces."

ence. But whether she has done so or not
is a matter of fact."
"The question," Vest went on, "is not
whether Cuba has achieved her independ
ence. The question is Can Spain conquer
Cuba? Can Spain continue to hold Cuba
as a province? 1 deny it. I say that the
ten long years of successful resistance to
Spain by Cuba shows that Cuba to-day has
the power to and will maintain successful
resistance. This thing a year ago was what
the French call an emeuteâ a mere handful
oi men called brigands on the east coast,
some of whom were hung as pirates
â hostes humani generis â to-day it is an
insurrection. Every Cuban is a patriot.
The Cubans have given up homes, fami
lies, everything, through th 9 hope of lib
erty. Tell me that a people like that can
be conquered. Ne?er, never, never will
they be again willing subjects to the throne
of Spain."
Lindsay (D.) of Kentuckyâ What pro
portion, if any, of the people of Cuba are
in sympathy with Spain?
Vestâ Xone. Even from the Spanish
pres3 i:i Cuba, under the espionage of the
Sranish authorities, it can be proved that
every Cnban is in sympathy with the
patriotic endeavor 10 achieve indepen
dence and self-government for that island.
No instance can be found in which a mil
lion and a half of people, combined and
confederated so unanimously as they are,
has ever been subjugated except by ex
termination. What American boy does
not remember the burning oration of
Henry Clay, when he spoke Greece in 1824,
and when he predicted that so long as
Thermopylae and Marathon were remem
bered, no Greek would lay down his arms
before the Turkish power? We are told
that these Cuban insurgents are negroes,
nluiattoes, Indians. So much the more
reason why we should sympathize with
them and sa3': "God help them in their
dire extremity."
Liberty lives with the poor and op
pressed, not with the wealthy and power
ful. It throbs in the breast of the im
prisoned bird; it has gone with the mar
tyr to the stake and has taken its flight
With his soul to God. Liberty cannot be
extinguished when the people are unan
imous in defense of the rights which God
has given them. And if these people,
ignorant and poor, struggling against des
potism, have imitated us should we con
tent ourselves with a bare exposition of
sympathy with their cause? It is a mere
farce for us to do anything else than to de
clare our belief to the world that tbe
Spanish cause is hopeless in the island of
Cuba. I deny and repudiate the doctrine
that all vestige of Spanish, power must be
eliminated from Cuba before we can recog
nize the independence of that people.
Are we to wait until the island is made
desolate by fire and sword? Are we to
stand silent and dumb while a Spanish
Governor â called a general â declares his
intention to bayonet the people of Cuba
and to butcher them into subjection to
the Spanish Queen? I say that if we do
God will curse ut. I say that if wo do,
and sit here idle until a desert has been
made in that splendid island, we may be
sure tlutt the time will come when there
will De reiributiop. upon us a peÂ»iÂ»'e be
cause we iiavfl not been true to the task
assigned U9 by providence, because we
have not cherished the legacy of self
government bequeathed to us by our
fathers.
Vest's splendid rnetoric was listened to
with rapt attention and creat admiration
by a full Senate and crowded galleries, and
his peroration was applaude 1 on all sides.
He was followed by Gray (D.) of Dela
ware, wno complimented him with the re
mark that if the independence of Cuba
could be achieved by eloquence it had
been achieved by the burning words that
had fallen from the lips of the Senator
from Missouri. . No one could have heard
them, he said, withont sympathizing with
the feeling with which the Senator's heart
was throbbing, aird without giving favora
ble response to every aspiration which he
had uttered for that unhappy island.
Gray went on to argue the futility of
I declaring Cuban independence when
every Senator knew that the struggle for
it had not yet succeeded.
Lodge (R.) of Massachusetts gave notice
that he would offer as a substitute for the
pending resolution the resolutions re
ported in the House from the Committee
on Foreign Affairs.
The Cuban debate is to be continued to
morrow. Senator Sherman of Ohio being
one of those present tc take part in it.
The voting on the resolution and amend
ments is to begin at 4 o'clock p. m.

: the verge of declaring it to be tKe sense of

tender its pood offices to secure Cuban md
"i endencp and to intervene in the con
flict progressing on that island if neces
j sary to protect legitimate American inter
jests there. Jiut the objection of Eoutelle
(K.) of Maine prevented the ereat major
ity of the House from carrying out its de
sire and the matter has gone over until
later.
Hitt (R.) of Illinois reported the resolu
tions relative to Cuba. They recite that
in the opinion of Congress a state of public
war existed in Cuba, the parties to which
are entitled to recognition as belligerents
and between which the United States
I should maintain an attitude ol neutrality;

tails such a loss upon American interests
, as to demand protection of them, and that

The reading of the resolutions was Jibe.r

An effort was made by Meredith (D.) of
I Virginia to secure unanimous consider
ation and passage of the resolutions, .but
i McCall (R.) of Massachusetts objected,
; and Hitt staged that he was instructed to
i ask consideration at the earliest possible
â  moment.

â  preceding adjournment, was begun at 5

j incident. Hitt, chairman of the Commit-

centrr aisle, in a ringing voice that com
manded instant attention, said:
"This afternoon I reported from the
Committee on Foreign Affairs a series of
resolutions. Since thin many gentlemen
have expressed a desire to vote upon them
now. Pursuant to this request and in
obedience to an instruction from the com
ruitreo to secure the earliest possible*
action upon them, I now asR unanimous
consent that they be taken up for action.
[Applause.] Ido not suppose it is neces
sary to make a speech upon them. The
resolutions are so brief, so plain, so sim
ple, upon a subject with which every one
in America is familiar, that there remains
nothing more to do than to vote upon
them." [Cries of "Vote."]
McCall (R.) of Massachusetts, who ob
jected to the present consideration when
the resolutions were reported, was on his
feet directly in front of Hitt. Boutelle,
who protested against the sudden action
of the House in the passage of a bill ap
pointing the Venezuelan .Boundary Com
mission, and Bailey of Texas all de
manded recognition. The latter was for
tunate enougn to catch the Speaker's eye
and said :
"If a separate vote can be had on
the resolutions, I do not know that I
snail object. The hist resolution, as I re
member it, pledges the support of Con
gress to the President in carrying out the
previous resolutions. I think that should
receive sufficient consideration."
Hitt â That resolution, I may say, was
added to the original draft &i the request
of some niem,bers who may not now care
to press it, and a separate vote, I doubt
not, can be had on it.
The resolutions were read by the clerk
and again a wave of applause swept over
the chamber. Mr. Boutelle with much
earnestness addressed tbe House.
"These resolutions, a 9 I understand," j
he s:iid, "grant belligerent rights to the
revolutionists in Cuba. This may invoive j
the United States in a w,ar with Spainr, J
and 1 must object to action now in the i
absence of a word of explanation from the ,
committee. I want to know what infor- \
mation was before them when they agreed
to recommend the passage of the resolu
tions to see if it warrants me, as a citizen,
as a patriot, as a member of this House-?
in approving their action, when the result
maybe to embroil my country in a war
with a nation with which we are at peace."
Hitt^Will the gentleman permit the
House to consider the resolutions after an j
explanation?
lioutelle â Why, Mr. Speaker, it is now !
5 o'clock, and it is impossible at thiÂ« hour j
to enter upon the consideration of this
momentous question in a manner com
mensurate with its greatâ its vast im
portance. Gentlemen about me, not all of
them I must say, are upging aciion ; but I
must insist that we give it at least decent
deliberation. I object.
The Speaker â Objection is made.
Hittâ The reciuest for present considera
tion was made in view of the statements
by many members that all the Republi- !
cans on the floor were ready and desirous '
of voting upon the matter, of which they
were fuily informed. I have no desire to
force the matter upon the attention of the
House at an inopportune time or over the
opposition of any gentleman, and will
Withdraw the request.
This ended the matter, and with a sigh
of disappointment many members voted
"aye" and none "no" on the motion by
Dingley (R.) of Maine, at 5:05 o'clock, that
the House adjourn until to-morrow.

GOEBEL'S BILL
MEETS DEFEAT.

Senate.

Only Eight Members Are in Favor
of Repealing the Southern
Pacific Charter. '
ARE HELPED BY DR. HUNTER.
â 
Now the Helpers of the Railroad Mag
nate Are Expected to Reward
Him by Election.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 27.-This was !
a "red-letter" day for Huntinston and his j
crowd in the Kentucky Senate. Their
fight was a victory that was not only a sur
prise to their enemies, but greater than
they themselves had hoped for. It was
the triumph of a miehty monopoly, with
all its forces and powers in full and hearty |
play, against right and justice and the !
liberty of the people. To the combined
lobbies of all the large interests that have j
been before the Legislature during this
session, together with several State offi- j
cials and X)r. Hunter, who did much to j
swing the Republican vote into line, are
attributed the victory.
It was a gallant light put up by Senator
Goebel against the giant corporation,
which confronted him with the most pow
erful combination that has been in Frank
fort since the attempt in 1887 by this com
pany to repeal the law providing for the
Kentucky Railroad Commission, which
they were able to pass through the riouse,
but failed in the Senate. The L. and N.
and C. O. and S. W. lobbies were active
against the bill, and they are to-night
glorifying with Huntington and his crowd.
The bill came up before the Senate at 3
o'clock under special order, and the de
bate was continued until 5:35, when a vote
was cast. Senator Weissinger of Louisville !
was the lirst speaker against the repeal. !
He spoke at length on the legal phase of i
the question and took the ground that it â 
would be an act of bad faith on the part of :
the State to repeal the charter. It would !
be the greatest crime ever committed by I
the State of Kentucky, he declÃred, and
would shake the contidence in our Amer
ican securities and our stocks all over
Europe. He said it was possible to get a
similar charter from any county court in J
the State and there was nothing unjust in i
granting a railroad charter. There were
similar and numerous other grants by
Congress and naught to contrary vas
said. Why could not Huntington, Hop
kins, Crocker and Stanford have purchased
the nine lines of roads as they had other
roads? Did any one suppose that the
charter allowed the Southern Pacific to co
to California and do business except in
conformity with the laws of California?
The repeal of the charter would disgrace
'. the State of Kentucky and throw property
i into confusion. It wouid scare off foreign
speculation and be the height of injustice
and rashness to repeal the charter, and
would wave the red flag of anarchy across
to England. He said the California people
had nor come with a memorial to this Leg
islature and appealed to reason apd justice,
if they were oppressed by this company,
but had used the comical cartoon and val
entine, which he displayed, picturing
Huntington as a grasping shark with his
power of money. Was this serious? he
asked. He did not believe the Legislature
couid be bougnt.
Senator C. C. McCord followed Stnfitor
Weissinger and spoke in favor of the Goe
bel repeal bill. He said that in the outset
the Southern Pacific road was subject to
the laws of California. The capital stQck
was to be $1,000,000, but they went to Cali
fornia and increased it to $170,000,000, and
at that time they operated 3700 miles of
road, all consolidated.
All the road except 1000 miles was owned
by them. The total amount paid into the
road was only $1,000,000. They shut out
competition. The Railroad Commission
tried to reeulate charges but were en
joined and thus bound hand and foot.
Meanwhile the people are paying what
ever rates the company may fixâ rates
higher than on any other road in this
country. There are only ninety-two per
sons owning Southern Pacific stock and
the whole people of California, at the
irercy of this grasping monopoly, paying
tribute to its demands, are here asking in
good faith from the Legislature of this
grand old commonwealth, whose people
love law and justice, for relief. The
builders of the road owned all the stock.
A repeal bill would not injure any one; it
would simply put them back where they
were before the consolidation took place.
Senator McCfiord closed with an earnest
appeal for the passage of the bill. Sena
tor McCaord was a member of the Ken
tucky Railroad Commission during the
past four years.
Senator C. J. Bronston proved one of the
strongest advocates against the bill. He
said these men would have formed this
company and built the road even if Ken
tucky had not granted the charter. The
.people of California could ship fruit
cheaper than the people of Florida. He
spoke glowingly of the luscious fruit â
fruit that was enjoyed. How could the
repeal of the charter prevent them from
operating under one system? It was a
convenience. Why could not the Califor
nia people pass a similar bill to the Goebel
bill? he asked.
Referring to the charge that the Rail
road Commission in California had been
elected in the interest of Huntington,
Bronston grew very fiery and shouted :
'â¢What an insult to the intelligence of the
people of California!" The quagmire of
politics had not descended to the election
of such officials by bribery, nor had such
been done, in his opinion.
He held up with scorn the cartoons that
had been sent to members as disgraceful
literature and was beneath his notice. He
closed by an earnest appeal to stand by
the charter until both sides could be heard
through the courts. Bronston explained
that he did not champion Huntington.
A fow minutes intervened before Senator
Goebel arose. He said he had endeavored
to present the matter dispassionately and
tried not to reflect on any one connected
with the Southern Pacific road. The peo
ple of California did not ask aid, but to re
move the very yoke from their necks which
was nxed there by the instrument passed
In 1884, which now disgraced the statute
books of Kentucky. The fact that they
came 2500 miles to get the charter was evi
dence of fraud. When he presented this
question to the Senate he did not know
that the stock of the original companies
was useless until the united Pacific stock
is canceled and surrendered.
The charter was a device to escape
the laws of the several States in whicn the
road runs. "When all competition was de
stroyed the burdens became so ereat tdut
the people were compelled to build lines
of their own. This they were doing now.
It wasfoolish to say that the California
people did not want the charter repealed.
He had received letters from the well and
sick men, women and children, outside
of party lines.
There was no dispute about the conflict
in California. They were crying out for
relief and demanding the repeal of the
charter. The road had secured a power
ful lobby â the largest ever seen here since
1888â to try to defeat the bill. It was a
remnant ol the charter-selling period
wiped out by the new constitution. It had
teen nine years since the charter was
passed, and still the road paid no taxes.
Senator Goebel closed by an appeal to
Senators to wipe from the statute book
this unjust and oppressive act, and relieve
the people of this burden inflicted on the
California people by Kentucky's sanction.
The ayes and noes were demanded and
the vote for the bill resulted: For the
Goebel repeal bili. Senators Bowling,
Clark, Goebel, Hissem. James S. Lay, Mc-
Chord. Rum mans, Sims â 8.
Senators Elliston and Brown and Elmore
and Ogilvie were paired.
Those 1 who voted against the bill were:
Bennett, Bronston, Carpenter, Deboe, Din
gus, Fulton, Gross, Hays, Hayword, Hol
loway, James, Jones, Landes, J. C. Lay, C.
B. Martin, H. L. Martin, Nell, Noe. Petrie,
Balhers, Smith. Stege, Stephenson, Taylor,
Walton, Weissinger â 26.
Senator Goebel said to The Call corre
spondent to-night:
"We had an uphill fight against a most
powerful corporation, and it is a victory
for the lobbyists who have worked against
the bill with ceaseless industry. Promi
nent State officials and a candidate for
Senator took an active hand in the fight
and did much to defeat the measure. We
can take no other steps; the bill has been
killed and there is no way to revive it.
They had the most splendid lobby and
powerful inHuence at work that has ever
been ai Frankfort."
Senator Hays and his lieutenants are in
high glee over their success in the defeat
of the measure.

The Southern l'aeiflc, Ilf Snyt, la A.buaed
hy the Shippers .
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 27.â J. C.
Stubbs, third vic-president of the South
ern Pacific Railroad Company, appeared
before the House Committee on Pacific
Railroads to-daj-. He had had charge of
the traffic of the Southern and Central Pa
cific roads for twenty-five years. It had
not been the intention of his people to in
troduce testimony before the committee
and he did not come to "Washington for
that purpose. Bur, being here, it was
thought advisable, in view of some of the
statements and charges made, to say
something regarding them.
He referred particularly to the state
ments whicn characterized the Southern
and Central Pacific roads as "oppressive,"
and that they discriminate against the
Union Pacific and diverted traffic from the
Central Pacific. It seemed to be the im
pression in some quartern that these com
panies held in their power all the traffic in
California.
Referring to the competition of water
transportation in California, he said the
waterways were open all the year round
arid formed a competition not to be found
elsewhere in the United States." In this
connection he compared the northern and
aft'lther'* sectfor. . â  r 'J^a btp te, by cp*HiHe-Â°
shWing-wbit;Ui^tiJoi3ticÂ«(J f tine value- Hi
real estate and the - cost â¢of â¢ transporting
grain, the principal product of the State,.
to export points. The products of the
vino and orchard he \ said were all mar
keted east of the Rocky Mountains, and
local rates had . little or no effect upon
them.
Referring to legislation affecting rail
roads, hje read from the constitution of
California the paragraphs defining the
powers and duties of the Board of Rail
road Commissioners. The powers granted
this commission' were unique. It was
made its duty to establish rates and pro
hibit discrimination and have complete
control of the rates of roads. The com
panies obeyed the dictates of these Com
missioners.
Mr. Stubbs was asked how it was that
nearly every member of Congress claimed
that these roads are extortionate, etc.
Mr. Stubbs said he thought it was due to
ignorance. Thirty-four per cent of the
railroad milage in California, he said, was
entire!}' independent and in no way under
the control of the Union or Central Pacific
systems. The rates, however, on the (36
per cent under the Central and Southern
Pacific were lower than the 34 per cent not
under their control. The Central and
Southern Pacific systems included some
thirty-seven roads. If the roads were sep
arated the rates would necessarily be
higher.
Replying to a question by Sulzer of New
York he denied flatly and emphatically
the statements that freight was being
diverted by the Southern Pacific from the
Central Pacific and being carried to New
York and points East cheaper by the
Southern Pacific.
Traffic was not diverted, as charged, and
rates could not be fixed without the con
sent of competing and connecting lines.
There were nine .great UÂ»*ough lines com
peting for transcontinental traffic To
these must be added sailing vessels, a great
element in competition. It had been said
that C. P. Huntington could make through
rates. This statement was ridiculous. The
rates were established by the various roads,
and it was impossible for any one road to
establish rates. Tne conditions were such
that rates must be made by concert.
It had been said that the shippers of
California were not allowed to select the
route by which they preferred to send
their goods. This, he said, was wholly
without foundation. The fact was just
the opposite. It was not the railroad that
cracked tlie whip over the shipper, but it
was the shipDer who cracked the whip
over the railroad. The roads had to use
their persuasive powers with the shippers
to get their trade.
Boatner of Louisiana asked how he ac
counted for the vehement opposition in
California and in Congress by members
from that State to any solution of this
matter except by foreclosure.
Mr. Stubbs replied that it was simply
the domination of the press, and in this
connection referred to many stories pub
lished in the San Francisco papers mak
ing charges against the roads, which he
characterized as being without foundation
whatever.
So far as passenger rates were concerned
these rates in the State of California were
the same as in any State in the United
States except perhaps New York and
Pennsylvania. The through rates from
California to the East and from the East
to California were the cneapest rates in
the world. He did not wish to be under
stood as stating that the press of Califor
nia was united against the roads. He did

LORD DUNRAVEN'S
NAME DROPPED
Expelled From the Honorary
Membership in Gotham's
Yacht Club.
WOULD NOT APOLOGIZE.
Nor Would He Cease Making
False Statements Concerning
His Defeat.
SOME CORRESPONDENCE PASSES
But It All Culminates in the Dis
gruntled Briton Suffering a
Great Disgrace.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 27.-Windham
Thomas Winuham-Quin, fourth Earl of
Dunraven and Mount Earl, better known
as the Earl of Dunraven, to-night suffered
the disgrace of being expelled from hon
orary membership in the New York Yacht
Club, the oldest organization of its kind in
America.
The action has been contemplated by the
club for some time past, but it was only
the exertion of the strongest influence by
certain members that saved his lordship
from being summarily expelled months
ago.
The action of the yacht club to-night
was taken because Lord Dun raven, they
believed, had had sufficient time to either
apologize or resign. Consequently upon
motion of Captain Cass Ledyard Lord Dun
raven was expelled from honorary mem
bership in the club by a vote of 39 to 1.
To-night's meeting had been adjourned
from two weeks ago, when the question of
Lord Dunraven's expulsion was brought
up in the form of a resolution introduced
by Captain Ledyard^ calling upon Lard
Dunraven to tender his resignation-
The meeting this evening was called to
order at 9 o'clock. Some forty yacht-owners
or voting members were present in addi
tion to about 300 regular members.
Commodore B. Of. Brown presided. The
meeting being a special one, only business
pertaining to the Dunraven question was
discussed and Secretary Oddie immedi
ately proceeded to read the different let
ters which had passed between Lord Dun
raven and members of the club. Firstlia
readDunriiven'sLnterto E. J. I'lieTpe and
thÂ« one to George L. Rives, which were
published this afternoon.
Next was read the following communi
cation in reply to Dunraven's letter to Mr.
Jfhelps:
New York, Feb. 26, 1896.
To the Commodore of the yew York Yacht Ctvbâ
Sir: Inclosed herewith will be found a com
munication from Lord Dunraven. As the com
mittee at its request was discharged at the
last meeting of ihe yacht club from further
consideration of this matter, this communica
tion is transmitted to the club for such action
as it thinks proper. The committee has ac
knowledged the receipt of tha letter and has
notified Lord Dunraven of its transmission Â»o
the yacht club.
They cannot submit this letter without ob
serving that Lord Dunraven misstates their
report in an important particular. BÂ« M?l
that a diagram was "accepted by the commit
tee as mathematically proving that we did not
see the actual objects which we did >cc."
Nothing in the. report justifies this statement.
It was not denied nor doubted that we law the
discharge-hole of the bilge pump above the
surface of the water on the day before the race,
and that it was below the surface on the day
following.
The fact demonstrated by the evidenre and
foundation in the report is that the hole could
not be visible above the water when the vessel
â was on an even keel, and consequently that it
was made visible on the first day by the vessel
having a slight list to starboard, the probable
cause of which the evidence pointed out. The
apparent change in the relative position of the
vessel had been increased in the meantime.
Very resDectiully yours, Edward .1. Phelps, J.
Pierpont Morgan, William C. Whitney, A. T.
Mahan, G. L. Rives.
Then followed the reading of the ap
pended communication:
2 Norfolk St., Park Lane, W., Feb. 12, 189 H.
Dear Fir: Seeing that the Hew York Yacht
Club was to meet on the 13th to' consider the
report of the committee of inquiry appointed
on the 18th of November last, I thought it
right to inform you by cable that I had written
to Mr. Rives on the Bth inst. and to Mr. Phelps
on the 12th inst. I remain yours faithfully,
IHWRAVEX.
J. S. Oddie Esq., secretary New York Yacht
Club, New York: According to papers here
Ledyard's motion postponed pending arrival
of letters. These, in my judgment, do not af
fect terms of motion. Request leave of Rivea
Phelps to publish them here. Dinuaven.
After the reading of these communica
tions Captain L'edyard jumped to his feet
and asked the unanimous consent of the
meeting to the withdrawal of his resolu
tion of February 13 demanding Lord Dun
raven's, resignation. This was willingly
granted. Then Captain Ledyard proceeded
tn read tho fallowing resolution, preceding
it with the following remarks:
"At the last meeting of the club I intro
duced a resolution which called upon
Lord Dunraven to resign his honorary
membership of the <lub. I thought at
that time, and I believe a great many
members of the ulutÂ» thought that that
method Of dealing with the situation â
asking him to resign instead of taking
more summary action against himâ was
more in accordance with the way in which
we had been dealing with the matter up to
that time.
"I do not think there has ever been in
the mind of any member of the club, sir,
an idea that we should accept any resigna
tion by Lord Dunraven unless it was ac
companied by a full, complete and ample
apology, and at the same time a retraction
of his charges. I think, sir, that the com*
munications which we have received since
tne last meeting have put a different as
pect on the matter. Lord Dunraven by
tnese several communications has shown
that he has not accepted the result of this
inquiry.
"He is still csrping, still hedging, still
evading and still insisting that he saw
with his eyes what we all know he did
never see and what has been conclusively
proved to have been impossible.
"1 think his course has been such that it2
is due ndw to the dignity and self-respect
of this club that action should be taken
which will leave no room for doubt as to
the attitude of the club. And with that
view I shall ask the unanimous consent of
the members of the club to withdraw the.
resolution which I offered at the last meet
ing for the purpose of submitting in its
place another and different one, as follows:
" 'The Earl of Dunraven, an honorary
rucm-ber of this club, has publicly charged
foul play on the part of the Defender, in
the recent races for the America cup, of
f-uch a nature as necessarily implicate the
managing owners of the vessel.
"'The charges have been investigated
by a committee of tlie highest character,
which proceeded judicially, and before
which Lord Dunraven has appeared and
Â£iven his own and other testimony and
has been heard in person and by counsel.
The committee has unanimously decided
that the charge was false, that it was not
merely unproved, but was affirmatively
disproved by competent and uncontra
dicted evidence, leaving no possibility of
douht
" 'We deem it to be among the unques
tioned rules which regulate the inter
course of gentlemen that when one finds
that he has been led by mistake to cast
unjust imputations upon the character of
another, he should promptly make such
reparation as remains in his power by ac
knowledging his error, withdrawing the
imputations and explaining his regret.
Such reparation to Mr. Iselin and his
associates the Earl of Dunraven, after full
opportunity, has failed to make.
" 'It further appears from the evidence,
including Lord Dunraven's own admis
sions, that at the time of the cup races he
intentionally refrained from making the
charge fcrmally or making any protest, as
required by the rules, because it was im
possible for him to verify the charges, and
he was unwilling to take the responsibility
of maintaining it.
" 'It further appears that in print and
in pubii-c speech Lord Dunraven has !
sought to justify the making of the charge
by numerous misrepresentations of fact.
He has been forced himself to admit the
untruth of most of these, yet he stub
bornly refuses to retract the injurious in
ferences drawn from them.
'â¢ 'The representatives of this club en
gaged in the international yacht races
with Lord Dunraven as the representative
of English yachtsmen upon the footing of
mutual confidence and honor. He hai re
quited their courtesy and confidence by
distrust and. suspicion, unfounded imputa
tions of fraud and a refusal of reparation.
" 'Lord Dunraven, by his course, has
forfeited the high esteem which led to his
election as an honorary member of this
club: therefore,
" l Eesohed, That the privileges of hon
orary membership heretofore extended to
tbe Earl of Dunraven are hereby with
drawn and that his name be removed from
the list of honorary members of the
ciub.' "
When Captain Ledyar.l concluded there
was a great outburst of applause. Some
one called for the ayes and noes and they
were so ordered.
Great surprise was expressed when the
name of Chester C. Monroe, owner of the
Orvia, was called, and he said "Xo."
Mr. Monroe's course was heartily con
demned by the members, who generally
referred to him in uncomplimentary terms.
Thus ended, so. far as the New. York
Yacht Club is concerned, this international
unpleasantness which has aroused so much
.bad feeling on both sides and excited the
yachting public of two continents for. six
months past.
" The following are thÂ»> letters received
from Lord Dunraven and considered by
the Yacht Club this evening: *f j,-".Â»> ; *
Lo.vdox, 27 Norfolk street, Park Lane, )
February 1!). ]
To .1. V. 8. Oddie, Esq., Secretaryâ Sir:
la supplementing my cablegram and letter of
February 14, 1 wish to emphasize the fact that
my letters to Messrs. Rives End Phelps were
written and dispatched before I had Heard of
the motion of Captain Ledyard.
Without commenting upon the grounds or
terms of the motion as to the justice of which
I do not agree. I wish to say in view of the fact
that a motion of such a nature has been made
and is a matter of record. I do not desire to
remain a member of the club whatever may tie
the result of the motion. I, therefore, beg that
you will lay my resignation before the club, a
course which will probably be approved by a
â¢majority of the members. I remain, yours
faithfully, Dvnraven.
On February 12 Lord Dunraven ad
dressed a letter to Hon. E. J. Phelps as
follows :
Dear Mr. Phefps: The attitude of assisting
the inquiry as a witness and not as a prose
cutor, which, in the nature of the case, I had
to adopt, and which I have consistently main
tained, prevents me from presuming to accept
or reject or to criticise affirmatively or nega
tively.
I cannot admit that there was a mistake in
the observed facts, as suggested by the em
ployment of calculations, which were accepted
by the committee, as mathematically provid
ing that we did not see the actual objects,
which we did Bee. The only time .for absolute
proof or disproof of the complaint that the De
fender did not sail the race on September 7
under her measured load water line length
must have been on the day of the race.
. My conduct after the first race, and my atti
tude toward the inquiry when I offered to go
to New York, and before the inquiry when I
was present in New York, all show my belief
in that propositionâ a proposition which, in
my opinion, was self-evident, and 1 think ad
mitted the evidenca by members of the cup
committee.
Feeling as I do upon this point I was unable
to adopt toward the judgment of your com
mittee the attitude wnich 1 should unhesi
tatingly .have taken had the inquiry been con
ducted at the proper time by the authority
under which I sailed, to which I made com
plaint and whose decision I was bound to ac
cept. I fully realized the difficulty of the situ
ation whicn had arisen, I think, largely
through mutual misunderstanding and on the
evidence before them I most willingly accept
the main conclusions of your committee, and
am only too glad to consider the dispute
closed. . "
I have throughout frequently stated that I
bad no charge to make against Mr: Iselin or
other owners of the Defender, and I do not
agree that he and his friends and all connect
ed with tne vessel must have been aware of it
if the Defender sailed her first race deeper
than she was measured. As this is a matter
personal to them,* I have written to those gen
tlemen to make the point perfectly clear-
There are two less important matters to
which I may briefly refer. ' I believed, and lor
the reasons given In the evidence, I think I
- was justified in believing that the owners of
the Defender knew of my complaint at the
time it was made, but I fully accept Mr. Ise-
Hn's statement, that he only became cognizan t
' of it on October 24.
I have also written to Messrs. Canfield and
Roberts admitting the error in my belief that
the vessels were ordered marked in deference
to my request made to the cup committee on
. September 7, though neither they nor any one
connected with the Valkyrie 111 understood
. that the yachts would be marked on September
8. I fully accept the statements of Messrs.
Canfie.ld and Rodders who believed they had
explained the intentions of the committee to
me. I remain, my dear Mr. Phelps, yours
truly, eaves.
On February 8 Lord Dunraven wrote to
George L. Rives, honorary secretary of
the special committee, as follows:
â  I beg to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of
, the report of the proceedings of the special
; committee of inquiry of thÂ« New York Yacht
Club, and trust that you will express to the
S members of- the committee my appreciation of
". the courtesies and patience with which the con
duct of so difficult an Inquiry h*B been marked.
Faithfully, Punraven.

All the London Papers -VoJ Pleased, With
Dunraren's Course.
LONDON, Exg., Feb. 27.â The Standard
will to-morrow say: It cannot be said that
Lord Dunraven's letters mark a satisfac
tory termination of a painful under
standing. His position is logically
strong; nor could he be blamed if he
positively refused to adopt the report
of the committee. Unfortunately he has
expressed himself in a manner that leaves
his attitude open to misconstruction. He
neither absolutely reasserts nor nnre
servedly withdraws his charges. It would
have been wiser if he had taken pains to
detine his present views.
The Graphic will say: -'Lord Dunra
ven's resignation is not a satisfactory end
of the dispute, but it is hard to imagine a
satisfactory one. At all events the course
he has taken is the only one he could have
taken with dignity."
The Chronicle will say: "We are sorry
that Lord Dunrayen did not adopt the
only proper course. His whole case utterly
broKe down, yet he now calmly goes over
the ground again. We are astonished and
grieved that he has not taken the course
that most gentlemen would."
TO FORFEIT FARMING LANDS.
Suit Commenced Against a Nebraska Concern
to Recover Property Worth a
Million Dollars.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Feb. 27.â Suit has been
begun at North Platte, In Lincoln County,
to declare forfeited to the State 20,000 acres
of farming land in that county now held
by aliens. The tract is controlled by what
is known as the North Platte Land and
Water Company and the original owner
was Lord Oglesby of London, England,
who in time disposed of it to Englishmen,
whose names are not known, but who re
side mainly in Kansas City. Suit is brought
under a law passed by the Legislature of
1891, which declares forfeited property
held by a corporation not incorporated un
der State* laws. Inquiry at the capital to
day shows that the company has never
been incorporated. This is the first suit
begun under the law and much interest
attaches to it. The property is valued at
a million dollars.

CAN THE SPANISH
CONQUQR CUBA?
Continued Jroin First Page
Attorney Ralston continued hi 3 address to
the jury. He spoke briefly and closed
with a claim that the defendants were
guilty of having violated the statute. Cap
tain Keer, the senior counsel for the de
fendants, then began argument before the
court on thirteen points presented by him
and npon which he asked the Judge to pass
in charging the jury. Captain Keer based
his argument mainly upon the construc
tion of the statute as regards a "military
expedition. " He declared that to consti
tute a military expedition there must be
an organization â infantry, cavalry or artil
leryâand that any other combination
dues not form such an expedition.
When Captain Keer had concluded,
Judge Butler announced that his (the
Judge's) interpretation of the statute,
which he expressed yesterday, had not
undergone a change. The Judge's inter
pretation of a "military expedition" is in
conflict with the views of Mr. Keer, and
his Honor amplified his remarks of yester
day by stating that he vas convinced that
by the terms of the statute Congress
meant to prohibit the fitting put of any
such expedition.
The Judge further said that he would
undertake, in his charge, to define the
terms of the act of Congress in question,
and that he would expect the jury to ac
cept the court's interpretation. A brief
argument followed between the. respective
counsel and the court over the jurisdiction
of the United States in this case, it having
been proved that the men and arms were
taken aboard the Horsa at sea and possi
bly beyond the ten-mile limit. This ques
tion was not decided.
Mr. Keer then began his address to the
jury on behalf of tbe defendants. In con
clusion the speak**- made the declaration
that Cuba would b"e free on July 4 next,
and he appealed to the jurors not to make
martyrs of the accused.
District Attorney Ingham made the clos
ing address to the jury. He reviewed the
case at length and asked for the conviction
of the defendants, certainly for the convic
tion of Captain Wiberg. At 12:2u o'clock
the court took a recess until 2 p. m.. when
Judge Butler delivered his charge to the
jury. The jury retired at 2:35 p. m. The
jury had not reached a verdict at 4 o'clock,
when the court adjourned until to-mor
row. Prior to the adjournment the jury
came in and asked the court whether all
three of the accused men could be consid
ered as officers of the Horsa. The Judge
answered in the affirmative.

Senator Proctor Tells of the
Need of Better Coast
Defenses.
SEVEN REASONS URGED.
There Is Not Sufficient Protec
tion to the Nation Solely
by the Navy.
FOE NEW REVENUE CUTTEES.
Passage of the Army Appropriation
Bill With No Greater Delay
Than Being Read.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 27.-ln the
Senate to-day the subject of the &ea-coast
defenses of the country was elaborately
treated in a speech by Senator Proctor of
Vermont, in which he advocated land for
tifications in prelerence. to the creation of
a powerful navy, and it was announced
immediately that the Committee on Forti
fications now contemplated a trip to New
York to examine the defenses of that
harbor.
Bills appropriating $500,000 for two first
class revenue steamers for the Pacific
Coast, and $100,000 for a public building at
Newport News, Va., were passed. The
army appropriation bill, with no greater
delay than caused by its being read in
full, also passed. It appropriates over
|23,0C0,000 and is the fifth of the annual
appropriation bills that has passed the
Senate.
A resolution was reported from the Com
mittee on Contingent Expenses authoriz
ing the Committee on Coast Defenses to
take testimony and to visit such places as
may be necessary, which was amended so
as to limit the examination to the defenses
of New York and agreed to.
A resolution authorizing the printing of
25,000 copies of the report on the introduc
tion of reindeer into Alaska was also
agreed to.
A peculiar pension bill was taken up
and passed. It gives a pension of $40 a
month to a private citizen, Christopher
Schmidt of St. Paul, Minn., on account of
blindness resulting from a chance shot
which had struck him while passing be
fore the military ritie range at Fort Snel
iing, Minn.
Proctor (R.) of Vermont then addressed
the Senate on coast defenses. The ex
posed condition of the coast of the United
States, he said, required no proof, and the
necessity of defending it should require no
argument.
It had been stated recently by Admiral
Walker that if the English were to send
over such a naval force as they conld
spare from Europe they would have their
own way; that something of a fight might
be made for Sandy Hooic and that nothing
would prevent them from taking the whole
coast. It could safely be said that we had
reached the point where the question was
not so much whether or not we shall de
fend our coast as it is how we can best
accomplish it. Shall it be done by land
fortifications alone, by a navy alone or by
a wise combination of tne two methods?
It was fully substantiated by reason and
authority:
Firstâ That a proper system of land de
fenses will make our great cities safe from
any naval attack.
Second â Such a system can be con
structed for a sum many times less than
the cost of a navy like the great navies of
Europe and for a sum that may reason
ably be expended.
Third â Land fortifications are much
more efficient for coast defense than a
navy and, when once constructed, are dur
able, cheaply maintained and easily
strengthened.
Fourthâ The defense of our cities cannot
be left to the navy alone, however large.
Fifthâ A navy that would equal the
great navies of Europe is unnecessary and
its cost makes such a navy impracticable.
Sixthâ A navy quickly deteriorates and
is expensive to maintain.
Seventhâ The construction of land de
fenses should always precede the building
of a navy.
Proctor went on to elucidate those sev
eral points. He gave the total cost of a
complete system of land defenses, as es
timated by the Endicott board in 1885, at
about $98,000,000. That estimate, how
ever, did not include $6,000,000 for Puget
Sound. The cost of the existing navy
would be, on the completion of vessels
now under construction, over $110,000,000.
For the sum with which we have pro
cured our navy we could have rendered
our seaports practically safe against the
combined assaults of all the navies admit
tedly superior to our own and could have
occupied the first place in the world as re
gards our fortified frontier and still have
money enough left to provide a Rood share
for the additional floating batteries and,
torpedo boats necessary.
At the close of Proctor's speech the Sen
ate bill for the construction of two first
class steam revenue cutters for service on
the Pacific Coast (to cost not to exceed
$250,000 each) was on motion of Squire
(R.) of Washington. taken from the calen
dar and passed.
The army appropriation bill was then
taken up. The bill appropriates $23,279,
--402. The bill was passed without amend
ment, fixing the number of hospital stew
ards at 100 instead of 112.

RECEIVES A DEATH BLOW
Defeat of the Resolution to Re
submit Prohibition to the
People of lowa.
It Is Expected, However, That the
Legalizing of Manufacturing
Liquors Can Be Beaten.
DES MOINES, lowa, Feb. 27.â 1n the
House of Representatives to-day the reso
lution to submit to the people of the State
the question of making prohibition a part
of the constitution was defeated, it is
probably the death blow at constitutional
prohibition in this State, which for ten
years has had no politics except the con
tests for and against prohibition.
The matter came up to-day on a report
from the Committee on Constitutional
Amendments, recommending that the
resolution pass and naming June 3 as the
date for the special election. It was un
expected by the Prohibitionists, who had
thought arrangements had been made to
let the matter go over another day. The
Democrats all voted against resubmission.
The result was: for resubmission 52,
against 41, absent or not voting G.
The same resolution has been favorably
reported in the Senate, but will be killed
without a fight. In the House there was
no debate; it had been understood that
when it came up it should go directly to a
vote and there was no scene of any kind.
The Prohibitionists declare their leaders
are responsible for defeat by reason of al-
Jowing the matter to come up at this tirae.
They Fay they will certainly defeat a
proposition to legalize the manufacture of
liquors, which is being pushed, and claim
they can certainly do it.

VAN HORN GETS
TARSNEY'S SEAT.
Majority Report of the Com
mittee Upheld by the
House.
BALLOTS NOT COUNTED.
But There Is Considerable Talk
Relating to Frauds at the
Election.
CORRUPTION IN KANSAS CITY.
Those Who Had a Hand in Frauds
Called Vagabonds and Unmiti
gated Scoundrels.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 27.-As soon
as the journal of yesterday's proceedings
was read in the House to-day the argu
ment of the contested election case of Van
Horn vs. Tarsney was resumed by Prince
(R.) of Illinois, who concluded his speech,
begun yesterday, in support of the action
and report of the majority of Elections
Committee 2. He contended that the con
testee (Tarsney) was not entitled to
further consideration in the matter be
cause of his laches in conducting his side
under the law.
At the conclusion of Prince's remarks an
agreement was reached and announced to
take a vote upon the report of the. com
mittee at 4:30 o'clock.
Long (R.) of Kansas asserted that the
ballots were not competent evidence, even
if the committee desired their recount, or
if any different result than that arrived at
by tbe committee could be reached by a
recount*
Maguire (D.) of California made the clos
ing argument for the minority of the
Elections Committee. It was based upon
the theory that under the laws of Missouri
the legal ballots could be segregated from
the illegal in a recount, and that being so,
it was the duty of the House to order the
committee to make the recount recom
mended by the minority. That recount,
if ordered, Maguire asserted, would show
that Tarsney was elected a Representative
in Congress of the Fiith District of Mis
souri.
The concluding argument of the case
was made by Johnson (E.) of Indiana,
chairman of the committee, who presented
the facts of fraudulent registration and
voting, upon which the majority cased
their finding that Van Horn had been
legally elected instead of Tarsney.
Johnson's characteristic energy and
force in public speaKing attracted to his
address the close attention of the mem
bers of the House, which was rewarded
from time to time by vigorous denuncia
tion of the frauds committed at the elec
tion in Kansas City and of those who
were engaged in them. "Characterless
vagabonds, unmitigatea scoundrels," were
specimens of the designations applied to
them.
His reference to the cause and refusal of
Registrar Owsiey to purge the lists of 4300
fraudulent names drew from Maguire the
statement that the board of revision aad
passed a resolution of thanks to Owsiey
for his labors and also in purging the list
and making practically correct returns.
"Oh, Mr. Speaker," responded Johnson,
With infinite scorn iv his voice and man
ner, "it is true there was a board of revi
sion, the members of which Owsiey ap
pointed, and it is true they passed, at his
suggestion, such a resolution. And it is
but another proof of his seouudrelism that
to absolute crime he added hypocrisy."
Turning with almost startling sudden
ness upon Maguire, he said, "I want to ask
the gentleman if he denies that fraud was
committed?"
Maguire said he did not.
Johnson â Does the gentleman deny that
Owsiey is a scoundrel? [Laughter.]"
Magure began to answer at some length,
but Johnson impatiently urged a direct
answer. Maguire said that as to whether
or not Owsiey was a scoundrel he did not
know.
Johnson (fiercely)â Well, I do. [Laugh
ter.]
A dramatic episode occurred near the
close of Johnson's speech. He was giving
the reasons why in hia opinion and bo
cause of the character of the frauds that
had been committed it was impossible to
separate the legal votes from the illegal
ones by a simple recount of ballots, which
was all the minority of the committee con
templated, and illustrating the point by a
supposititious case, easily conceivable in
the circumstances, asked the gentleman
from Ohio (Taylor) what he would do with
those ballots. "I give him five minutes to
answer," said Johnson, and unexpectedly
took his seat.
Every one turned to Taylor, who sat fac
ing Johnson some distance away and ap
parently no more expecting the challenge
than did other members. He tooK the
floor promptly, however, saying: "The
proposition of the gentleman is character
istic of his ideas of conducting debates. I
know of his method of treating other gen
tlemen and I cannot hone to escape; but I
refuse to put the same limit upon my men
tal operations that limit his mental opera
tions. And when the gentleman aeks
me a question pertinent to the discussion
and blandly offers me five minutes in
which to answer I repudiate his kindness."
[Applause.]
Johnson retorted that the eentleman
evoked applause, not from his own house
hold, but from those on the other side, and
his refusal to answer was an acknowledg
ment o! the weakness of his position.
Upon the conclusion of his remarks
Johnson moved the previous question
upon the resolution of the committee and
the substitute of the minority that the
case be reopened and the ballots counted.
The vote was taken on the substitute
and it was rejectedâ ayes 112, noes 164.
The Democrats and Populists supported
the substitute, together with the following
Republicans who voted against the Elec
tions Committee and the body of their
own political associates: Arnold of Penn
sylvania, Brown, Burton of Ohio, Cod
ding, Dovener, Penton, Huling, Hyde,
Kulp, Leigh ty, Parker, Pitney, Powers,'
SouthwicK, Taylor, Wellington, Wright.
The resolution declaring Robert T. Van
Horn elected and entitled to the seat was
then agreed to without division.
Burton (R.) of Missouri addressed the
chair: "Mr. Speaker, my colleague, Mr.
Van Horn, is present and ready to take
the oath."
The new member, amid applause from
the Republicans, was thereupon escorted
to the bar of the House by Burton, where
the oath of office was administered by
Speaker Reed.

MANHATTAN BOXING BOUTS
The Contest Between Steve O'Don
nell and Jim Dwyer
Was Exciting.
The New Jersey Pugilist Badly Bat
tered and Put Out in the
Seventh Round.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 27âThe
boxing bouts at the new Manhattan
Athletic Club attracted a good-sized crowd
to the gymnasium of the club to-night.
The principal attraction was the ten
round go between Steve O'Donnell and
Jim Dwyer of Elizabeth, N. J.
Tommy White of Chicago and Marty
McCue of this city furnished the opening
bout of six rounds at 125 pounds. McCue
was clearly outclassed, and the judges
agreed on White as the winner.
The next bout, of six rounds, was be
tween Paddy Purtell of Kansas City and
Joe Harmon of New York. Considerable
execution was done by both men, and, as
the judges disagreed, the referee declared
the bout a draw.
The event of the night came oil at 9:45
o'clock.
Round oneâ Dwyer made the pace, shoot
ing his left in with fapidity, O'Donnell
seemine to be very slow, as if awaiting hia
man. Steve landed two rights on Dwyer's
body. No great harm was done by either
in this round.
Round two â Both hit short repeatedly.
O'Donnell fought on the defensive while
Dwyer kept up ft fusilade of lefts and
rights, landing frequently, but the blows
were light.
Round three â Dwyer's right eye was
almost closed. Steve jabbed him in the
face with the left, and stopped several of
Dwyer's right drives with ease.
Round fourâ O'Donnell stopped most of
Dwyer's hits easily, but once in awhile
the Jersey lad Janded a left jab, and for a
time had him weak and groegy.
Round five â O'Donnell planted his left
twice in Dwyer's face and the blood flowed
from Dwyer's nose. O'Donneil hit his
man left and right and Dwyer clinched to
save himself. Dwyer was very groggy.
Round six â Dwyer was weak and stag
gering about the ring. O'Donnell landed
three heavy body blows.
Round sevenâ O'Donnell landed several
left chops, but Dwyer finally got in a
sharp left-handed facer which won loud
applause. O'Donnell drove his man to
the corner of the ring, where he hit him
twice with the left and then sent the rieht
across the point of the jaw. Dwyer fell on
his back and was counted out. He had to
be carried. to his corner, but soon revived.

There Is Yet a State of Un

in Japan.

So Far All Attempts to Over

Failed.
MARQUIS ITO'S VISIT ABROAD.
Talk of the Prestige of Great Britain
Being Impaired in the Far
East.
TOKIO, Japan, Feb. 11.â There is much
talk of important Cabinet changes in
Japan. The political party that holds the
balance of power between the Government
supporters and the opposition seems dis
posed to throw in its lot with the hitter,
now that the budget has passed. All Par
liamentary attempts to overthrow the
Ministry have hitherto been defeated by a
eeneral conviction that no obstacle should
be placed in the way of measures for in
creasing the armaments of the empire. It
was known that if the lower house adopt
ed a motion of want of confidence in the
Ministers an appeal to the coun
try would immediately be made, and
thus all legislative work would be
suspended for several months. But the
budget, with its large appropriations for
developing the army and navy, havinn
passed the representatives, a feeling of
uneasiness as to the potentialities of the
opposition and the tendencies of politi
cians hitherto neutral now begins to pre
vail. It is evident, however, that until
the budget passes the upper house, and
until both houses have approved the vari
ous measures for increased taxation with
out wnich the bn<lge* scheme would be
necessarily inoperative, no politician sin
cerely desirous of assisting the programme
of increased armaments can range himself
with the opposition. Hence there is not
likely to be any serious commotion in
political circles jus-t yet.
Marquis Ito's alleged intention of visit
ine Russia to attend the coronation of the
Czar continues to be the most discussed
event in Japan. It is natural that the
Marquis should seize a good opportunity
for bringing himself once more into close
touch withlEuropean statesmen, but there
exists a great obstacle to his departure
from Japan at this juncture, namely, the
difficulty of rinding some one to take his
place at the head of the Cabinet without
dislocating the present arrangement of
political parties. It is impossible as yet
to predict whether that difficulty will be
overcome, or whether it will compel the
Marquis to abandon his hope of a journey
westward. -'
The insurrection in the southwest of
X r-a is described by newspaper corre-
FToriclents as an attempt on the part of the
Mm faction to recover administrative
power and avenge the murder of the
Queen; But official advices indicate it to
be nothing more than a violent protest
against the ill-advised action of the Ko
rean Government in attempting to compel
the adoDtion of the Occidental fashion of
cutting the hair. So far from fomenting
the movement the heads of the Mm family
are assisting the Government to suppress
it. The Koreans, living in a chronic state
of dissatisfaction, are ready at all times to
obey the smallest impulse for breaking out
into open revolt.
For the moment an exceptional calm
reigns over the generally troubled sea of
Korean politics. The Tai Won-kun re
mains auite in his ostracism from official
dom. Perhaps the death of Lis long-time
foe, the Queen, has satisfied the heart of
the sanguinary old intriguer. The Cabi
net seems to be rirmly set. Its predomi
nating elements are of the Kin family, one
of the three great political factions in
Korea, the other two being the Liâ that is
to say the King's clan â and the Mm, or
relatives of the late Queen. A Kin is now
at the head of the Cabinet and a Kin holds
the portfolio of Foreign Affairs. It is a
progressive Cabinet, friendly to Japan.
Moreover, there are no indications of Rus
sian intrigue or interference. At present
some of the American missionaries, how
ever, continue to publish very bitter things
about the Japanese, thereby vindicating to
some extent the charges originally brought
against them b\ r the latter.
The capital of Japan, already disfigured
by a network of wires spreading above the
â treets â telegraphic, telephonic and elec
tTlc-Hght wiresâ is about to have an over
head railway added to these disfigure
ments. Several railways now enter Tokio,
but to reach the terminus of one from that
of another necessitates a street journey by
carriage or jinrikisha. The Government
has obtained the consent of the Diet to
bring these lines into junction by means of
two central stations â one for the private,
the other for the state roadsâ which will
be united with the various termini and
with each other by means of an elevated
railway fifteen and a half feet above the
ground. The work will be completed in
six years at a cost of 3,500,000 yen, the
method of construction being that em
ployed in Berlin after the Franco-Russian
war, namely, brick piers spanned by iron
arches.
Some of the most influential Japanese
journals write that unless Em-land takes
steps to demonstrate her fearlessness of
Russia, the prestige of the British lion will
be impaired in *he far East. These news
papers point to Russia's recent activity,
commencing with the tripartite alliance
in the spring of last year; proceeding to a
Joan that placed the Middle Kingdom at
the mercy of the Muscovite; passing on to
Die leasing of Kiaochow Bay as a naval
station, and concluding with an attempt to
purchase from Holland an island close to
Sumatra. Through all these thing?
England has remained quiet, and the
Japanese do not yet understand that con
sciousness of strength to act effectively
when necessary may serve as sedative in
the case of a great power.

AN EXTENSIVE STRIKE
Five Thousand Garment-Makers

Caused by the Manufacturers Refus

BALTIMORE, Ma, Feb. 27.â One of tbe
largest labor strikes ever inaugurated in
this city is now on in earnest. Five thou
sand members of the United Garment
workers' Organization remained away
from work to-day. This general strike was
caused by the manufacturers refusing to
recognize the organization.
The clothing manufacturers claim to be
but little affected by the strike. They say
the work for the spring trade is all done,
and that a month's rest of the present
workers would not materially injure busi
ness.
The strikers spent the larger part of the
day in organizing. They appointed a
"settling" committee, consisting of tei.
members, one from each union, and will
remain ready to receive overtures from the
manufacturers. 'It is claimed by the
strikers that overtures have already been
received from four firms. Both sides are
firm and claim to be confident of success.
Directly and indirectly 20.0U0 persons are
affected by the strike.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1896.
ASSASSINATED
IN A MONASTERY.
The Father Superior Shot
to Death by a
Madman.
RIDDLED WITH BULLETS
A Scream of Mortal Agony That
Will Haunt the Old
Mission.
THE MURDERER'S ANTECEDENTS
Comes From a Family of Lunatics and
Had Been a Protege of
His Victim.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Feb. 27.â
Early this morning the startling rumor
Hew about town that Father Superior
Ferdinand Benimeyer of the old mission
had been fatally wounded by an assassin's
bullets. At the old mission confusion and
distress replaced its usual tranquillity for
the cruel deed had in no way been fore
shadowed.
The criminal arose this morning with
the other inmates, served mass or "Medi
tation" â as the 4:45 service is called â sat
at table with his victim, and nothing un
usual was observed in his speech or de
meanor, nor did anything occur tnat could
have in any wjiy aroused his malice.
Yet as the ased Father Superior was
climbing the stairs leading to nis bare cell
he heard a strange explosion and saw this
man, known to all the inmates of the
monastry as "Henry," who worked in the
garden and stables of the mission and
shared the devotion of the brotherhood
and privileges of their simple life, standing
a few steps above him, still clad in the
cassock he had worn at the sacred srrvice.
In quick succession four other shots
were fired, each taking effect in the old
priest's body ana calling forth a scream of
agony which will forever haunt the old
mission walls. Fatl.er Reynarius ran
from the carden, where he was watering
his flowers, and brought other brothers
from their homely task to find the head of
their order lying in a pool of blood at the
foot of the stairway.
Drs. Hall and Otto were at once sum
moned and an examination was made.
One Dullet had struck the chin, cutting
the flesh, and a second the chest at a point
near the armpit. Two penetrated the
body in the recion of the abdominal
cavity. A fifth broke the thigh a little
above the knee.
Father Ferdinand is a man of nearly 70
years and of extraordinary corpulence,
weighing 300 pounds, and this vast ac
cumulation of flesh caused the search for
the bullets to be attended with unusual
difficulty.
At noon it was stated by both physicians
that the chances of recovery were faint,
the only hope being an operation to follow
up the course of both bullets in the ab
dominal cavity and repair the injuries
done to the vital organs as far as possible.
During this operation, while the patient
j was under the influence of ether, it was
j found that the stomach was perforated,
i front and back. Both holes were stitched
I up and the channel caused by the bullet
on the right side of the cavity was iound
j to have penetrated the left lobe of the
I liver. It was impossible, on account of
the weak condition of the patient, to do
I more.
Wheh Henry finally walked out of the
j door and in the direction of the city one
i old brother followed him, not so much
; with the intention of bringing him to pun
i ishment as with the idea that the man was
in a dangerous condition and might wreak
further harm on himself and others. But
Henry merely went down to the Sheriff's
â  office, sat aimlessly about the steDS of the
j courthouse for a time, waiting for some-
I body to appear, and then betook himself
j downtown, where he found Constable Dan
Martin, and announced that he was the
! criminal who had shot one of the mission
'. fathers, and wanted to give himself up.
At the jail he wrote out his full name,
i Bernard Henry Gerhart Krusemeyer. He
yielded up the weapon, which he stated he
had boueht expressly for the purpose of
killing the old priestâ a British bulldog
double -action six-shooter, thirty-eight
caliberâ with all the chambers empty. To
one he stated that he had killed the old
man because he had used him brutally,
but to another, in a moment of confidence,
he weirdly explained that he was avenging
a wrong upon his sister, who died three
years ago, and who since her entrance into
the other world has been wickedly wronged
by Father Ferdinand and was being kept
by him in purgatory.
At first he seemed to glory in his deed,
but as the day wore on his elation failed
him and he shrank in fear from any allus
ion to his crime, and was afraid to com
promise himself by any further statement.
He was searched by Constable Martin
this morning and again in a more thor
ough manner by Officer Storni this after
noon, but all that was found on his person
besides a matchbox were two crucifixes
and a rosary.
He is charged with assault to murder,
but his examination will be postponed
awaiting further reports of the victim's
condition.
Krusemeyer is a man of 30, medium
height, slender, fair, with weak blue eyes
and a simple expression. Several years
ago he applied for admission to the order,
but examination of his antecedents re
sulted in the discovery that his father and
brother were in insane asylums and that
an insane taint ran in his family, and he
was refused admission.
For two years past he has made his home
at the mission, and the padres agree he
was an excellent and faithful workman.
He had been subject to insane spells last
ing for a day or two at a time, when he has
talked wildly, and on this account strong
objections have been made to permitting
him to stay there.
Father Reynurius, whom Henry declared
he hated at first sight, objected strongly
THE RT. REV. THOMAS GRACE. BISHOP OF SACRAMENTO.
to his presence, fearing some such tragedy
as this, but old Father Ferdinand, whom
he so wantonly attacked, was his especial
friend and protector, and it was due to his
intercession that the man was permitted
to stay.
The victim is a native of Westphalia,
whence Krusemeyer also came. Father
Ferdinand entered a European monastery
when a young man, and came to this
country on the same vessel with Father
Reynarius, his old colleague, in 1859.
He is Father Superior of the Sacred
Order of the Sacred Heart and all its thirty
five houses in America. He lirst came to
Santa Barbara. eleven years ago.
Krusemeyer's act is attributed to an in
sane freak and nothing but pity is felt for
him at the monastery.
Laterâ Father Ferdinand Bergmeyer
passed away with the setting of the sun.
Drs. Hall and Otto state that he suffered
little and died from the shock of the terri
ble injuries received at his advanced age.
Everything that the best surgical skill
could suggest was done to aid him, but he
was beyond the reach of surgery from the
first. When the surgeons first reached his
side he was perfectly calm and composed.
He spoke with sorrow of the man who
had committed the dastardly act, saying
that they had always known that he was
mentally unsound, but that he had never
considered him at all dangerous, and
Henry had looked upon him as his best
friend. He could not sufficiently express
his surprise at the savage attack, which
took him totally unawares, but expressed
his conviction that it was due to the wild
momentary impulse of a mad man.
As an orator and scholar Father Ferdi
nand had no superior in his order and his
kindly disposition endeared him to all his
associates and parishioners.

SACRAMENTO'S
NEW BISHOP
Rev. Father Thomas Grace
Is Notified of His
Appointment.
A POPULAR SELECTION.
Members of His Flock and Others
Express Their Gratifi
cation.
HIS WORK IN THE PRIESTHOOD
Has Labored for Many Years in Vari
ous Fields on the Pacific
Coast.
IPSACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 27.â Rev"
Thomas Grace, who has been for several
years in charge of this parish, and has
managed the Sacramento diocese since the
death of Bishop Manogue a year ago. was
to-night officially informed of his appoint
ment to the bishopric.
Several friends of Father Grace called
to-night to congratulate him on his good
fortune, and to express their gratification
at his appointment to such an important
post of honor in the church which he
represents. Father Grace received the
Dews with his accustomed modesty.
While fully appreciating the high honor
which the spiritual head of the Catholic
church has conferred upon him, he has a
keen realization of the heavy responsibil
ity it entails. As a matter of fact, he was
not desirous of being promoted to the
bishopric, but like a good soldier he stood
ready to do the bidding of his superiors.
The official notice of his appointment
will be received with great satisfaction by
the members of his flock, and even outside
of Catholic circles.
Bishop Grace was born in County Wex
ford. Ireland, in 1842. He received his
earlier education in the private schools of
his native place, then at St. Peter's, Wex
ford, and afterward became a student at
All Hallows College in Dublin.
He was ordained to the priesthood in
1867, and in September of that year came
to California. His father, James Grace,
was of Norman extraction, being a de
scendant of the famous Raymond Le Gros
of the twelfth century.
Father Grace's first pastorate in this
State was at Red Bluff, Tehama County.
He built the Convent of Mercy there and
was subsequently stationed at Grass Val
ley and. later at Marysville. He came to
Sacramento in 1881 and succeeded Rev.
Father McSweeny, now of Oakland, in
charge of St. Rose's parish.
SAUSALITO FISHERMEN FIX Elf.
it Coat Four Italians $20 Each for Sell'
itiff Without Licente.
SAXJSALITO, Cat,., Feb. 27.â The Fish
Commissioners have been at work here
this week and as a result four Italian
fishermen were compelled to pay fines of
$20 each for selling fish without a license.
The Italians have been doing consider
able business in this line lately and it
came to the attention of the Commis
sioners, who immediately proceeded to
capture them. They came to Sausalito
and hired the swift launch Rustler and
and went out after the men. The Italians
did not understand the meaning of so
much excitement until they were threat
ened with arrest. The Commissioners
carefully explained their cause of com
plaint, but the men seemed to consider it
a joke.
When the officers demanded a fine of $20
the men lost all control of the English
language and refused to understand a
word that was said. At last the officers
pulled out some legal documents which
seemed to have the desired effect, for the
fishermen drew out their well-rilled purses
and paiti the shining twenties over to the
Fish Commissioners, who departed after
giving decided instructions for the Italians
to follow in the future.
SAX RAFAEL'S 3f ISSISQ MAD.
Buchanan's Disappearance lions Sot
Greatly Exrreise the Community.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Feb. 27.â Robert
Buchanan, an account of whose disappear
ance was published in The Call to-day,
was not thought much of at this place.
He was known to be a hard drinking man
and is said to be in debt to a great many of
his associates on the North Pacific Coast
Railroad. He should have received the
position made vacant by the untimely
death of William Tierney, a short time
ago, but for some reason known to the
railroad people he was not given it. He
was the engineer in charge of the local
freight train.
Not long ago Buchanan had a great deal
of trouble with his wife, and the scanaa
lous behavior of the two disgusted their
friends and neighbors.
It is generally thought by those who
kiK>w him that he has skipped out and
will not return.
NORTHERN VA.CJ.BIG RECEIVERS.

SEATTLE, Wash., Feb. 27.â A private

named March 3 as the day when their
Honors will consider the petition if pre
sented, the Circuit Judge having given
notice that he would be here and partici
pate in the proceedings.

FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 27.â The residences
of J^nies Scott and Henry Persons in the
Altamont addition to Fresno were com

together with most of the furniture. The
estimated value of the buildings and
furniture is about $5000. It was by the
greatest good fortune that other property
was not burned, owing to the fact that the
locality is beyond the fire limits, and that
a high wind was prevailing at the time.

THE ATTACKS OF JOHN P. IRISH

STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. 27.â Governor
Budd arrived here to-day, and is seeking
to work up enthusiasm among citizens on
the Wilmerding school with a view of
securing its location here. He was shown
the statement made recently by ex-Sena
tor Goucher to the effect that the Governor
had formed an alliance with Superin
tendent Daggett of the San Francisco
mint in reference to electing a successor
to Senator Stephen M. White. Mr. Budd
said :
"I have never had any talk with Dag
gett in regard to White's successor. The
only thing in the world that Goncher
could have based such a statement on was
what occurred a year ago when the Legis
lature elected Perkins to the Senate. Dag
geit spoke to me about getting the compli
mentary vote of the Democrats. That was
all there was to it, and we have never since
that time discussed the SenatorshiDin any
way."
When spoken to with reference to toe
attacks made on him by John P. Irish, the
Governor did not seem inclined to discuss
Mr. Irish.
"I have nothing to say of him," said he,
"any more than I have of any man whom
I have been obliged to remove from pub
, lie office. All the facts leading up to bis
! removal are set forth in the reports of the
last Legislature covering the investigation
i of the affairs of that institution, and I have
mo time to repeat them just now. Were i
I obliged to reply to the attacks of every
man removed by me from public office for
j cause I would be kept busy all the time.
I The tects which caused me to remove Mr.

STOCKTON-- THE NEW CHICAGO OF THE GREAT SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY== STOCKTON
THERE was once a very estimable
I I and wealthy woman in Stockton
I who was not so wise in worldly
jJL lore as she afterward became. How
she gained the added wisdom is a
neat little story in itself, which bears a
moral for every resident of the Pacific
Coast and may serve not inappropriately
to introduce the theme that is to follow.
The storyâ lt happened a year or two
ago that this very estimable and wealthy
woman wanted blankets for the beds of
her house. She was in a measure wise,
for, having an adequate purse, she resolved
to get only the very best woolen blankets
the market could afford. So she placed
her order with the largest and most
famous dry-goods importers in the United
Statesâ a New York farm. She stipulated
no price, only requiring that the blankets
should be the very best.
She waited a fortnight. Then the pack
age cameâ and the bill with it. She paid
the latter nnquestioningly, then opened
the package to feast her eyes on the soft
white woolen.things that had, perchance,
come all the way from India, or at least
from Germany or Scotlandâ or from
wherever it was that sheep gave the best
wool and men made the best blankets
thereof.
Behold ! each fleecy blanket bore upon
it a modest little blue trademark upon
which was the unromantic because fa
miliar legend, "Stockton Woolen Mills,"
a legend which, to European or Asiatic
ears, sounds of luxury and wealth. The
very estimable and wealthy woman was
astonished and indignant.
"You have pent me Stockton blankets!"
she wrote to the New York house. "You
have cheated me! I could have bought
these at home and saved the freight! I
ordered the very best!"
"Madam, we sent you the best blankets
to be had in the world's markets," wrote
the New York bouse.
The moralâ lt is so plain that he who
reads may also run.
The theme â This bustling, thriving city
where "the best blankets in the worlds
markets" are manufactured, the Chicago
of the San Joaquin Valley â Stockton.
Extravagance in words, some may think,
to compare Stockton with Chicago, but
these know not the remarkable activities
of Stockton, her ambitions, her energies
and her almost limitless resources. Sup
pose old Captain Weber had been gifted
with foresight enough to compare the vil
lage of Stockton that he founded in 1841
with the city of Stockton in 1806; and sup
pose he had been daring enough to formu
late his vision into words to the rough cat
tlemen and miners who helped him drive
his tent-stakes into the rich soil; and sup
poseâbut the analogy is already clear
enough.
Have you been to Stockton and seen its
broad, level, well-paved streets, its hand
some Courthouse, its beautiful Public
Library building, its noble and costly
churches, its fine residences, its thousands
of small homes und cottages, its imposing
business blocks', its hotels, its theaters, its
great fiouring-miils, its many busy fac
tories, its shipyard, its electric and steam
railroads and streetcars, its tree-lined ave
nues, its parks, its famous baths, its natu
ral gas wells, its wholesale and retail
establishments, its immense warehouses,
its schools and academiesâ have you spent
weeks in the city and seen some of these
ana more? If you have not, then, in a
modern commercial sense, there is a very
large and interesting chapter in California
life still before you.
"What brings Stockton to claim so very
large a share of public attention just at
this time is the fact that she is taking
giant strides on the road to commercial
supremacy at present. A great competing
line of rai'road is focusing its strength
and power in her lap and will soon
be bringing all the treasures of
the great San Joaquin Valley to
her arms. Only yesterday the great
San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railroad stretched out its steel rails from
Stockton to the Stanislaus River. To-day
the rails are being laid across Tuoiumne
River, maybe to-morrow they will have
reached Fresno and next week Bakersfield.
Stockton is grasping. She is planning to
lay under tribute all the wealth of the
greatest valley of the Golden State of the
Union. She reaches out for the figs and
the wine and the grains of Fresno, and
for the cattle and the oranges and the
olives of Kern, and casts even
glances of longing and wistfulness down
into the sunny gardens of San Gabriel and
Riverside, though she has at her very door
all the fruits of the earth that prosper
under genial skies and on rich soil. Stock
ton is ambitious! And she is something
more. She has not only the possibilities
of the present and future; she has within,
her a true touch of the spirit that made
Chicago great.
And in Stockton's present and future
greatness all the State rejoices. Fresno
ana 'â¢ iKersfield will welcome the steel
tenta esand pay their tribute gladly â even
profitably to themselves â and Los Angeles
welcomes her wistful and longing glances
and will, in time, shoot outa steel Â«â â â¢ 'acle
from its own boundless lesource . ross
the Tehachapi and join hands wit ock
ton.
Consider the geographical loc â¢ n of
Stocktonâ at the head of all that vast won
derful valley of the San Joaquin; it the
head of tidewater navigation on .he San
Joaquin River. Its situation alone is suf
ficient to inspire all faith in its future
greatness. California cannot grow with
out benefiting Stockton. The great valley
must cease to produce the richness of the
soil and sun or else Stockton will go on
and on. She has direct tidewater com
munication with Han Franci?eo Bay. Cap
tain Weber chose the site for his first tent
Btakes better than he knew.
Consider Stockton's present thrift and
greatness. Skim over it but in the briefest
fashion; a volume could not do it f'lll jus
tice. Hold on! Stockton is not the only
city in the world. It is well to consider
beforehand that there are other cities,

I even in the interior of California, and
Stockton herself is not insensible to this
fact. The prosperity of the whole State is
bound up together in bonds that cannot
be severed, so that what is said of Stockton i
must redound not alone to the glory of
Stoqkton, but to the State as a whole.
However, the present theme is Stockton â
her present thrift and greatness. Where
shall the beginning be made?
The water front is as good a place as
any. Two lines of river steamers land you
from San Francisco â land you in the very
heart of the city, one block from the
Courthouse and City Hall. Passing up the
channel to the stone and concrete quay,
you see first and most conspicuous of all
the great rlouring-mills â the Union, the
Crown and the Sperry. These have at
present an aggregate capacity for 9000
barrels a day, which will soon be increased,
by the installment of a 700-horsepower
engine in the Crown mill, to 9200 barrels.
The change increases the capacity of the
one mill from 1500 to 1700 barrels. In ail
there is over $1,000,000 invested in milling
at Stockton.

macadamized, and laid out at right angles.
It is a modern city â you see that at a
glance. You see that there are many,
very many, handsome and imposing busi
ness blocks, so many in fact that it would
be folly to undertake to mention even a
few of them.
The streets are crowded; people jostle
each other; men and women hurry here
and there; bicycles are numerous; several
systems of electric streetcars run here ana
there and seemingly everywhere, and wide
though the streets be there is no more
room than is needed for the countless
vehicles through which the pedestrian
mu?t pick his way carefully in crossing.
Here is focused not alone the retail
trade for a rapidly growing city of 20,000
inhabitants, but here are gathered men
from all parts of the county of San
Joaquin, besides many visitors and strang-

ers from all parts of the State and fro-n the
East. Most of them come in vehicles
and all of them have business to transact.
The retail trade is extensive and is
carried on with as much push and enter
prise as is displayed in many a city of rive
times the population. Windows are hand
somely dressed and goods of all kinds at
tractively displayed. At Hale'?, Bost
wick's or the Arcade dry-goods stores you
will find conditions and commodities
much the same as in the modern de-

partment stores of the metropolis, and
there are other stores of the same kind,
though of lesser extent, of which the same
is true.
For a few blocks on Main street, on
either side of the Courthouse. and indeed all
the thoroughfares immediately surround
ing the big public square, one miclit
easily imagine himself to be in the midst
of a city of 100,000 or more population.
And this is very largely due to the ad
mirable business methods of the retail
merchants of Stockton. They take care
not to hide the light of their wares under
a bushel, and you have only to keep both
eyes open to appreciate tue extent of their
activities, the desirability, the cheapness,
the quality, toe profusion and the di
versity of their commodities.
Five wealthy banks handle the sinking
funds of Stockton merchants, so to say.
The Stockton Savings Bank is ono of
these, with resources of over $1,000,000.
The San Joaquin Valley Bank, the First
National Bankâ these are institutions
that enjoy the confidence of some of the
wealthiest men in the State.
A circumstance that ougbt not to be left
unstated here is that vacant nouses are
scarce articles in the city of Stockton, and
desirable vacant houses are almost an an- |
known quantity. This fact in itself
speaks volumes for the real estate mancet,
and Mr. Wilhoit, who is one of the best
known of a score or more of enterprising
and yet conservative real estate'brokers in !
Stockton, adds the further information
thai there is a very good inquiry for buti

â â ...... _ i
ness properties and residences. The real
estate market is strong and steady. It
never did boom and jump to extravagant
values, but it has steadily grown and
grown, and keeps growing month by
month. "When you buy a lot or a house
or store or acre property trom a Stockton
real estate man to-day you may be sure
you are paying just about what the prop
erty is worthâ no more and no less. And
this time "next year it will be worth still
more.
What will make it valuable? The I
steady, the rapid growth of Stockton.
What will make the rapid growth ? Many
i things. The energy and enterprise of her
: business men and the local pride and |
patriotism of her citizens, for one thing.
The growth of her present manufactures
i for another. Take the woolen - mills lor !
\ exampleâ those that turn out the best j
blankets in the world. They make other j
; things as wellâ 'Scotch tweed" suitings, j
! for instance, or at least what a good many
I fancy -priced tailors sell for that famous '
line of goods. These make enormous
profits on it, and the dandy thinks he is
I wearing an imported suit or trousers. He j
I is wearing one just as good, only he is |
I paying more money than he need. Every j
year this plant is being added to and the
number of employes increased.
There's the Pacific tannery for another
thing-employing sixty men and a capital I
stock of $:JUO,OOO -turning out some of the !
| best harness leather in the world and ship- '
j ping largely to Boston, New York, St. !
J Louis, Chicago, Japan and elsewhere.
! California bark has no equal for tanning.
There's the big shipyard, where barges, j
schooners and steamers are built and re
paired. Its scope inconstantly increasing. !
There's Shaw's plow works, manufactur- j
ing a patent plow of its own that has a big
sale and employing large capital and many
men. There's the Holt Manufacturing
Company, selling between $200,000 and
$300,000 worth of combined harvesters
each year, and making them all at their
big works in Stockton. This is one of the
largest concerns in the State, but not the
only manufacturers of agricultural imple
ments in this city. The Haines-Houser
harvester is manufactured here and in
large quantities. The firm is putting a
patent side-hill machine on the market
now, and the orders are coming in. The
Holt company, by the way, is also famous
for the quantity of wagon and carriage
wheels it turns out in a year. The Matte
sou & Williamson house manufactures
plow castings and other hardware. These
are a few of the manufacturing enterprises
of Stocktonâ just a few by way of sample.
All of them could not be told about in a
single newspaper article, and the few

names that are cited are given rather as a
matter of "good faith," as the contribution
editor would say.
There's the big lumber-yard of P. A.
Buell & Co., over on the Mormon Chan
nel. It's one of if not the very largest in
the State, but it's not the only one in
.Stockton. There's the Stockton Lumber
Company for instance, also near the Mor
mon Channel, and thus possessed of ex
cellent facilities for handling lumber at
the least expense. It is worth mentioning
that Mr. Buell is president of the Stockton
Commercial Association, an organization
whose prime object is to niake Stockton
still greater financially, commercially, as
a railroad and as a manufacturing center.
Orin S. Henderson is its secretary, and
the entire State is pretty well familiar
with the long line of. prominent business
men that make up its membership. The
list is ioo Ions: to quote here, for there is
yet much to be said of Stockton and time
and space are short and fleeting.
In the matter of hotels Stockton is by
no means lacking. There are the Yo
semite, the Commercial and the Grand
Central â these are the biggest in the city,
well appointed and run on a modern sys
tem. And another hotel is being built by
D. and Fred W. Rothenbush, proprietors
of Stockton's brewery. It is going to be a
fine affair and modern throughout. Two
stories in brick are up now, and two more
stories are being piled atop of them.
There is also a new church in the course
of construction, and a business block and
some residences are being contracted for.
Stockton's not standing still.

is rushing its work southward and pre
paring for a handsome depot at Stockton
terminus, and the Corrai Hollow road is
almost completed to the coal mines. The
people of this region take a good deal of
honest pride in bcth these big enterprises.
The Corral Hollow road promises to bring
good coal for the manufacturers at the
rate of $2 a ton, delivered in Stockton.
That's a big thing for the manufacturers ;
bigger still for Stockton.
Then there's the prospects for a big
beet-sugar factory being located on the
4000-foot canal now in the process of
construction off Mormon Channel. The
prospects amount almost to a certainty,
for the farmers are planting beets on a
heavy soil that is peculiarly adapted to
their culture. Funny thing about that
soil. It's as good for orange* as it is for
hay and grain, ana as good for olives as
it is for sugar beets. Claus Spreckels has
said that Stockton will probably be the
site of one of the first of the new sugar
refineries that will soon be constructed in
this fytate.
While on the subject of farming and soil
and products of the earth, just consider
what Professor George Davidson, one of
the most noted scientists in geology, as
tronomy and civil engineering in America,
recently wrote to the editor of the Stoclr
ton Record :
But a few miles within your foothills and
parallel with the outline thereof lies the great
mother lode of California, the lode from which
hundreds of millions of dollars have been
taken; the lode from which as many more mil
lions will be taken in a systematic and certain
manner. This great lode is awakening to a
new life of activity, and the people thereof will
draw from this irrigable area a large part of
their supplies, and in return will send down
their gold, and through Stockton will send
their monthly output of bullion. This trade
cannot fail to be of tbe greatest benefit to your
thriving city nnd its surroundings.
Above this irrigable area lie the great lines
of drainage from the watershed of the Sierra
Nevada. Every drop of water, before or after
it is used for mining or irrigation purposes,
can be made to develop a large percentage of
the electric power which will be used in your
city in the manufactories and in lighting; in
local transportation and in transportation
throughout the county to the mountains.
Perhaps, indeed, this power will be used in
household andfarming operations as it is now
being used in France.
One of the new enterprises that promises
to increase Stockton's fame and wealth is
the Stockton Art Pottery Company. The
organizers are all men noted for their suc
cesses in other business undertakings.
The capital stock is $100,000, naif of which
has been subscribed, and work will now
soon begin. There is an abundance of the
very best material at hand. Designs are
to be furnished by the very best artists in
that line.
Consider now Stockton's greatness as a
center from which to ship wheat. It has
immense warehouses and unrivaled facili
ties for shipping. Grain stored in Stock
ton can be loaded on barges and deliv
ered anywhere contiguous to San Fran
cisco Bay within iwenty-four hours. Last
year, thougli the wheat crop was short,
Stockton's immense storage capacity was
taxed to the utmost, and a greatly in
creased capacity nas been provided this
year.
In the matter of tidewater shipments,
Stockton has reason to be and is particu
larly proud. In 1893-94 the water ship
ments in and out averaged 2000 tons a
day. The rail shipments for the same
period were over ninety carloads a day.
Since then two big raiiroads have bteu
started. If the wheat crop is good this
year, it is not at all extravagant to predict
a total wheat shipment of 3000 tons a day.
The natural - gas wells of Stockton!
Here is a gift of nature thai cannot be
overestimated. Bore anywhere, a pure
and limpid stream gushes forth. There is
a gaseous odor to it and rare medicinal
properties. Build a gas reservoir over the
artesian well. That is all that is necssary.
The pas goes up to your storehouse and
the water flows on. It is no* good drink
ing water, but the Jackson Baths of Stock
ton, fed by several constantly running
streams, are famous throughout the State,
not only for the soft pleasing quality of
their waters, but for their medicinal prop
erties as well. They are housed in a hand
some and commodious structure and form
one of the attractions of the city. Think
of the commercial blessings of natural g&3
to a manufacturing community. Think of
its blessings to householders and tax
payers. The most of this rare natural
opportunity has not yet been made, and
yet natural gas is retailed to consumers at
the rate of $1 for the first thousand and
50 cents for each succeeding thousand cubic
feet. Nature has been very kind to
Stockton.
And in the way of water power from the
mountains Stockton- has every facility.
Her electric light plant is operated by
power secured from running water out of
the Sierra Nevadas. Here are possibilities
unbounded, opportunities that are just
beginning to be appreciated.
Consider, briefly, the county of which
Stockton is the county seat, the great San
centage of arable land of any county in the
State, and it is the only county whose soil
Joaquin County. It has the largest per
consi&ts entirely of a sandy loam, wi:h a
porous, sedimentary quality of a high de
gree of moisture.
Ten acres in orchard will support a large
family. . . .
Stockton could aptly be called the "City
of Churches." There are nineteen church
societies, ah of which own houses of wor
ship; nineteen spires pointing heaven
ward, musical bells pealing forth the
hours of devotion, and their portals ever
ajar to those wishing to enter.
The progress already made in the con
struction of the Valley Railroad promises
splendidly for the future. Last week ideo
graphic communication was established
between the construction camp at the front
and the main office in Stockton. The Val
ley road and the Postal Telegraph Com*
pany will work together in this connec
tion, and this will increase the duties of
Miss Annie J. Smith, the manager of the
main office at Stockton.
The Stockton and Lodi Terminal Rail
road will probably be one of the valuable
lines centering in Siockton. .From the
city limits this line runs through and be
side the largest vineyards in tne $tate,
and spurs and feeders have been thrown
out to facilitate transportation. â¢ â 
This is not ali of Stockton. There is
much yet to be told, far more than could
be told. It must be seen. See Stockton

VAIN SEARCH FOR A SHIP
The Cadzow Forest Thought to
Have Struck on Cape Flat
tery Rocks.
Daneerous Obstructions Unmarked on
the Chart Discovered During
a Cruise..
VICTORIA, B. C, Feb. 27.â The Do
minion steamer Quadra returned to-day
from her cruise in search of the Cadzow
Forest, which extended aloug the west
coast as far as the Queen Charlotte Islands.
No wrecK or wreckage was seen or heard
of, however, with the exception of the
total loss of the schooner Wanderer.
In Hesquial the sealing schooner Louis
Olsen was at anchor, and her skipper, Cap
tain Daly, brought aboard the Quadra his
logbook and chart to show what fearful
weather he had experienced after leaving
the bar of the Columbia River in company
with the Cadzow Forest, both vessels
bound for the Straits of Juan de Fuca.
The last seen of the Cadzow Forest from
the Louis Olsen was at 10 p. m. of the 2d of
July, when the vessels were running to
the northward with the wind to the south.
From the logbook it appears that shortly
before daylight the wind .backed to north
east and a few hours afterward veered sud
denly to the southeast, blowing very hard
with terrific squalls.
This continued until the morning of the
sth of January, when the weather cleared
up and land was seen a miles off to*
leeward, which Captain Daly recognized
as Uchalet.
Every exertion was made to keep off
the shore, storm trysails being set be
tween squalls to give the ship headway.
This driving kt>pt her oft' and the next i
land made was Cape Cook, 120 miles to j
the northwestward.
Captain Daly is of the opinion that the
Cadzow Forest has truck on some outlying
reefs en the west coast, of Vancouver
Island, as being in ballast she may drift to
leeward much faster, than the Olsen, or,
keeping too close to the Washington
shore, has struck Flattery rocks.
The former surmise, however, cannot
well be correct, for should the Cadzow
Forest have struck anywhere on the west
coast of Vancouver Island some wreckage
would doubtless have drifted on shore,
wnen, with inquiries made from place to
place by. the Corwin and Quadra, some
thing would have been heard of it.
On February 23 four Indians arrived at
Clayoquot from TJchulet, having traveled
along the beach between the two places,
and reported having seen part of the
bottom timbers of a vessel with copper on
them, no doubt part of the Nineveh.
OCaptain Wall bran reports that admiralty
chart 2430 of Queen Charlotte Island is
dangerously erroneous, the trend of the
west coast and distances between promi- â¢
nent headlands not being laid down with,
any accuracy. -
A survey of these islands is urgently re
quired. Six dangerous rocks hitherto un
marked on the chart were located and
examined on the cruise just completed.

SAN DIEGO, Cal., Feb. 27.â The water
carnival to be given Saturday night is
rapidiy assuming proportions that assure
a grand display. New features are being
added daily, almost hourly, and as the
ladies have fallen into line to assist, the
work of the committee grows easier.
Yacht decorations will begin at the Santa
Fe wharf to-morrow morning, and it is
thought that most of the vessels will be
ready for illumination long before Satur
day evening.
Several clubs of young ladies and gentle
men have chartered fine yachts on the
bay, and they will be transformed into
lloating palaces of beauty. The ferry-boat
Silver Gate has been chartered by the
Launch Club, and will be coVered with
brilliant and attractive lights.
The vessel will be in tow of the tug
Santa Fe over the entire route, and will
enable people by hundreds to enjoy an ex
cursion of eight or ten miles, and at the
same time view the procession to great
advantage.
The full City Guard band will be sta
tioned on the Silver Gate, and the ad
miral's band will be on the flagship Phila
delphia. The steamers Thetis and Alba
tross and the merchant-ships in the harbor
will be in line. A barge havinc headlights
at the four corners and otherwise illumi
nated will be anchored where the Monterey
now lies, and from this the Roman can
dles, skyrockets and red and blue fires wili
be ignited.
The line of march has been changed by
Grand Maishal Friend so that the proces
sion will go in single sarpentine form to
the north turn, when a double sinuous
line will make the countermarch.
The parade will oe dismissed by the exe
cution of an immense labyrinth, winding
and unwinding, the diameter of the circle
being about a half' mile across. These fes
tivities will probably be repeated when the
Italian cruiser Cristoforo Colombo arrives.
THE CARSON MINT CASE
Witness Langevin Believed to
Have Been Hounded Into
Insanity.
Mysterious Disappearances, Corrupt
Use of Money, Attempts at Sui
cide and Other Sensations.
CARSON, New, Feb. 27.â A recent dis
patch sent from this city to the Examiner
stated that Joseph Langevin had gone in
sane and conveyed the idea that Langevin
while insane had given testimony against
Heney in the mint case that convicted an
innocent man. Northing could be farther
from tue truth.
The testimony given by Langevin was
that Bruie called at his house at night and
paid him $400 and that other sums had
been paid him at different times. Mrs.
Langevin corroborated the testimony,
and William Langevin, who was in the
house, saw Brule call and saw the money
in the morning. It was also in evidence
and not disputed that Trcnmor Coffin
railed a few hours before to find out what
Langevin knew. Heney, the defendant,
admitted that he had paid Langevin $200.
Langevin's son was spirited away to
Canada to prevent his testifying and is
still there. Langevin's testimony, sprung
so suddenly in the case, showed the jury
that the case was being fought not with
legal steps, but by the corrupt use of
money, the handling of which was ad
mitted by an attorney. All sorts of mali
cious persecutions followed Langevin's
testimony, and it is no small wonder that
his mind is by this time unbalanced.
Brule, the man who carried the money
to Langevin, was sent to jail for throe
months and fined $.500. The United
States District Attorney presented a simi
lar complaint against Trenmor Coftin for
the use of corruption money, but up to
date the court has paid no formal atten
tion to it.
To-day it is claimed that an attempt was
made to poison Flo Stewart, the woman
who was living with Pickler when the
bullion was dug up in his back yard, but
most people think that she attempted
suicide by poisoning.
GOOD ROADS FOR CHICO
Reservoirs at Intervals and Miles
of Steel Pipe for Sprinkling
Purposes.
The Expense Will Be From $8000 to
$io,oooâ Every Wheelman Is
Jubilant.
CHICO, Cal., Feb. 27.â Work on the
Chico road district is progressing rapidly.
It is a recognized fact that copious sprink
ling throughout the dry hot months of the
year will go a long way to preserving the
roads and make them much more easy
and less expensive to repair.
On Ninil* street will be seen where a
large lot of work is being^done. W. W.
Montugue & Co. of ban Francisco, who se
cured the contract for supplying the steel
pipe to be used in conducting the water
for sprinkling purposes to the tanks
pfaced at intervals along the roads in this
district, have men at work making large
sheets of steel into pipe.
This steel is shipped in sheets from the
factory of the Allen Wood Company in
Philadelphia, and has already been re
received here. When finished there will
have been over five miles of pipe, about
four n-.iles of which will be 8-inch and one
mile of 6-inch.
A reservoir is being built which is eighty
feet wide and 300 yards long and ten feet
deep. The sprinkling-carts will be filled
from the main pipes direct, no storage
tanks being used except on the lateral
system of pipes when the distance is so
great that the friction retards the flow of
water and where it would take too long to
till the carts from the pipes.
The tank system is recommended in
every case by all officers having experience
in road sprinkling.
A sprinkling-cart holding 8000 gallons
of water can be filled from a tank with a
6-inch discharge pipe in forty seconds. It
takes from four to six minutes to fill the
cart from a water main under pressure of
SO-foot head and a 3-inch discharge. The
wagons are calculated to distribute 500
loads per day. making a saving of about
four hours per day in the time of filling.
The reservoir and pipes will be so ar
ranged that they may be cleaned at any
time.
The estimated expense of putting in the
reservoir anil the main line will be from
$SOOO to $10,000, of which the Chico road
district will pay two-fifths and the county
general fund three-fifths. The sprinkling
of the roads has been indorsed by every
wheelman and every one who has ever
considered the subject.
Wat Annie Blakely Eighteen?
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. 27.â The case
of David Fisher, charged with perjury, is
occupying the attention of Judge Dough
erty and a jury here to-day. Fisher's of
fense consists of swearing that Annie
Blakeley was 18 years of age when he pro
cured a license to marry that young girl
last fall.
"Cupid" Thompson, the marriage license
clerk, testified that the young lady looked
to be at least twenty years old when he
issued the license.
Prosecutine Attorney Butts objected to
this line of testimony and wanted the
young lady regularly introduced in the
evidence niariced "Exhibit A" and filed
with the records of the court.
The attorney for the young husband
â would not entertain this proposition, but
placed Mrs. Fisher on the witness-stand,
when she declared she was 18 years of age
and lhat she had so informed her husband
at the time of her marriage. This state
ment is denied by the bride's parents, who
caused the young man's arrest, and they
offer the family Bible to prove their daugh
ter is only 1(5.
This is the criminal case which was set
for 10 o'clock yesterday morning and which
was mixed up with the water works case
which was set for the*shme hour. The fate
of Fisher will be known to-morrow.
Tucker Chosen President.
BALTIMORE, Md., Feb. 27.â News was
received in this city yesterday from Cairo,
Egypt, that Hon. Melville P. Tucker, who
was appointed by President Cleveland in
April, 1894, one of the Judges of the
mixed tribunal In Egypt, has been elected
president of that court.
Ex-Senator I'lntt Injured.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 27.â Thomas
C. Platt slipped on the sidewalk near the
Fifth-avenue Hotel last night and fell
heavily, injuring his hip and thigh. The
ex-Senator, it is thought, will be confined
to his room for & few days.
SPORT OF ALL KINDS
The Olympi- Club Will Soon
Have a Grand Handball
Court.
How Dr. Boyson and Colonel Taylor
Angled for Sharks in Mou
terey Bay.
The members of the Olympic Club who
have a predilection for handball will be
pleased to know that Directors Short and
Eaton had a conference yesterday with
Mr. Leventritt, who is owner of the let
that adjoins the club building proper, and
that very satisfactory arrangements were
arrived at regarding the proposed con
struction of a handball court. Mr. Leven
tritt had an architect visit the site yester
day, and it is safe to say that men will be
put to work in a very few days laying the
foundation for what will certainly prove
to be the best equipped handball court in
America.
It is stated on pretty good authority
that a new coursing park will soon be es
tablished within close proximity of the
Inglesule racing 'ground's. The owner of
about 100 acres of land near Ingleside, who
is at present in the East, wrote that he
was perfectly satisfied with the offer that
was made to him for a lease of the prop
erty in question. The projectors of the
new scheme, who are said to have good
financial backing, will go to work imme
diately erecting a fence around the ground
that is to be used as a coursing demesne.
It seerus as if the sport of the leash is fast
becoming popular.
A meeting of the anglers who are inter
ested in fly-casting will be held at the
Olympic Club tnis evening, it will be re
membered that the tournament which was
held on Stow Lake about two years ago
was a most successful affair, and, in view
of the fact that there are many lovers of
the pleasant pastime who are decidedly
anxious to witness another such enjoyable
contest, George C. Edwards, the president
of the Fly-casting Club, has called a meet
ing for this evening, when matters of per
sonal interest will be discussed and an
election of officers held. It is hoped that
a large attendance of anglers will be pres
ent and particularly those who have mas
tered the art of fly -casting.
Doctor Boyson has discovered that
spearing shark is a most exciting pastime ,
The doctor recently visited Capitoia, and
in the company of Coloi.el Taylor he had
a few hours of good sport in Monterey Bay
on Monday last. .
"1 found an old harpoon," said the doc
tor, "which had seen its better days, but
having nothing more useful at hand, I
tried it on man-eaters and basking sharks,
which are now very plentiful in the beau
tiful bay of Monterey.
"The first shark I sent the steel weapon
into made a fearful commotion, and as it
shot off for parts unknown my right foot
got foul of the fleeting line, and for a sec
ond or two 1 thought that the sport would
prove dear to me.
"I managed, however, to get the limb
free Jrom the line, and then everything
looked lovely. At the end of 100 yards of
rope I had two large empty powder kegs
tied, ani it would have amused you to see
those buoys bob up and down as the
monster of the deep shot past the school
of man-eaters."
"Finally the kegs were seen to float on
the surface of the deep, and then we sur
mised that something was wrong. The
harpoon had torn its way out of the shark,
and the sport came to a sudden ending.
Five sharks were speared during the day,
but they all escaped because of a defect in
the spear. .
â¢'On Friday and Saturday I will try my
luck again and as I will be provided with
good tackle I expect to have grand sport.
It beats salmon-fishing hollow and any
lover of real good sport should not miss
the present opportunity of visiting Capi
tola and enjoying the pastime of catching
sharks, which are now more plentiful than
salmon in Monterey Bay. Boats and men
can be hired for $2 50 per day, and all that
is required in the way of tackle is about
200 yards of strong line, a first-class har
poon, and empty powder kegs or floats of
any kind which are used for the purpose
of drowning the monsters of the deep."
The Norddeutscher Schuetzen Club of
this City will bold its annual prize-shoot
ine and bowling contests at Shell Mound
Park on Sunday, March 1. The thirty
prizes which will be offered for rifle-shoot
ini: will be distributed to the winners at
620 Bush street on the evening of March 3.
WINNERS OF MANY MEDALS
California Exhibitors Who Won
Prizes at the AtlaDta
Fair.
Gratifying Results of the State Beard
of Trade's Efforts in the
South.
J. A. Filcher, manager of the California
State Board of Trade and manager of the
State's exhibit at the Atlanta Exposition,
is highly delighted over the magnificent
success of that venture. When he at first
proposed to have the State make an ex
hibit at Atlanta he met with more dis
couragement than encouragement from
people in all parts of the country, and for
a time it looked as though no exhibit
would be made. However, he worked
night and day and after overcoming obsta
cles that seemed almost insurmountable
he reached Atlanta with the finest exhibit
of California products that ever crossed
the Rocky Mountains. At Atlanta he
found himself surrounded with jealous
rivals and competitors from all parts of
the United States, but these were van
quished and as a result California received
more gold, silver and bronze medals and
diplomas than any other State in the
Union.
Mr. Filcher yesterday received the first
complete list of the prizes won by this
State and he is justifiably proud of his ef
forts. The list of the prize-winners is as
follows:

MISS EDNA LISSON.
One of the prfitty young misses of Bakersfield is Miss Edna Lis?on. The above
portrait gives but a partial view of this beautiful girl. Her mother, Mrs. A. Lisson,
vouches for the following: About two years ago Edna was suffering from eruptions
of the skin. Her face, her hands, her body were at times all completely covered with
blotches of small pimples. Many were the remedies tried to no avail. All kinds of
soaps, ointments and doctors' prescriptions availed not. About this time Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla was recommended. The first bottle was used and the only
change for the better was the regularity of the bowels and the bright clearness of the
eyes. After the second bottle Edna began to get well. She not only became strong
and hearty, but all the facial blemishes disappeared, and is now the beautiful young
lady you see before you.
This story is not colored just to boom Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. The above
story is about the mildest way of telling the actual facts concerning the blood remedy,
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. Doctors have often been puzzled and "give it up"
about Joy's. It is a peculiar herb remedy. It contains no mineral poisons. It is
made entirely of herbs. The only people who speak against the remedy are tne drug
gists who have "A BETTER PROFIT" sarsaparilla. When you want a good blood
medicine that produces no pimplea take Joy'a Vegetable Sarsaparilla.

THE PIRATE RAVES.
Mr. Huntington'g mud machine, which
performs its work under the name of a
"literary bureau," has been set to a new
employment. The task of deiiling leading
men of the State by quoting them as sup
porters of the funding scheme and at
tributing words to them which they never
uttered has been abandoned for a lime,
and the machine set at work to do what it
can to bring into ill repute the great ana
successful enterurise of constructing the
San Joaquin Railroad.
The attack on the competing road was
made, of course, through the medium of
the Evening I'tut, the organ in this City of
the Southern Pacific of Kentucky, and
was made yesterday with as much force as
the Literary Bureau could pack into an
editorial something more than a column
in lencth.
The ariici.e is notable because it is the
first open assault the monopoly has ven
tured to make upon the San .Joaquin road.
Hitherto the antagonism has been of the
covert kind whose attacks are made slyly,
secretly and by indirection. Now the
antagonism is avowed. The monopoly
assails the enterprise of the people with
almost every form of vehemence known
to literature. There are evidences in the
article of futile attempts at satire, sar
casm and irony, and some successful one*
at indiscriminate abuse, misrepresentation
and plain Jying.
The public is told that some of the pro
moters of the San Joaquin road are
anxious to have it appear as "an elee
mosynary institution, built for the good
of the public, constructed with benevolent
purpose and devoted wholly to salving the
souls of men." That is a specimen of the
satire. The public is further told,
"The only indication that the San
Joaquin Valley Railroad is a rail
road is in the rapacity and greed it
has manifested for gifts in the way of
terminal facilities at its termini and in
the towns through which it is to be
built." That is a specimen of the plain
lying. From these specimens a public
too bnsy to attend to all the futilities of
the Literary Bureau may judge the resr.
Through all the forms of the long-drawn
out attack there nuts the one purpose of
beating down the competing road if pos
sible by m&liening its prom^tors, assailing
its methods and depressing its credit. It
is a bold attempt to destroy the prestige
of the road and weaken public confidence
in it to such an extent that the nsonopol3*
may be saved from the competition that
threatens.
This new form of antagonism, however,
though more offensive, is not more dan
gerous than that which the monopoly has
shown to the San Joaquin road ever since
its conception. Past attacks have failed
and this one will fail. All the rage of
words in the whole column will only con
vince the public that the competing road
must be doing good work for the State,
since the monopo'y is so eager to malign it.
SILVER AND THE TARIFF.
. The debate in the Senate on the com
bined silver and tariff issues has cleared
up the controversy sufficiently to show
the ground on which all Republicans can
stand. Senator Carter on the one hand
explained that his opposition to the tariff
bill was not due to any desire to force
silver legislation on the Senate at this
time, bin to the fact that thÂ« bill, being a
purely emergency measure, was hastily
drawn and full of defects. On the other
hand Senator Hoar disclaimed any inten
tion to support gold monometallism or
the Cleveland monetary policy, and de
clared 'the Republicans of tfee Slast be
lieve in a .double standard of value, in
accordance with the constitution and the
doctrine promulgated by Alexander Hamil
ton."
On the showing made by these state
ments it ought to be easy for all Republi
cans in Congress to find a basis of agree
ment. Silver legislation at this session
would be useless, for Cleveland would veto
it. and, moreover, it is not imperative. On
the other hand tariff legislation is im-
perative. Every month shows a deficiency
in the revenue, and every day shows large
withdrawal* from the gold reserve. I iitil
we have some change in the tariff these
deficiencies' will continue, the drain on the
reserve will go on, and beJo.re the next ses
sion of Congress Cleveland may find
another opportunity to please his Wall
street friends by making a further increase
in the bonded debt of the country.
Senator Carter's statement that before
Morrill called up the tariff bill in the Sen
ate efforts were being made to bring about
a conference between the Republicans of
both houses, so that a satisfactory adjust
ment of differences might be made, cer
tainly affords a sufficient explanation for
voting against Morrill's motion. Why
should he vote to take action on one bill
wiien arrangements were already under
way to provide another? 'Ihe fact that
such a conference was being prepared was
in itself a justification for the course pur
sued by Carter and other Western Sen
ators, and disposes of the charge that they
made a deadlock on the tariff for the pur
pose of compelling the passage of a silver
bill.
It is well known that the emergency
I tariff bill is not a Republican measure,
â  and was passed by the House only because
! it was believed that Democratic support
would be given in the Senate, so that it
I could be enacted and put into operation at
i once for the relief of the treusury. As the
i Democrats, however, have refused to vote
I for it, and the Democratic President has
declared he does not need it, there is cer-
t ainly no reason why Republicans should
make it a test of party allegiance. It
I should be thrown aside as Carter suggests
I and a conference bill agreed upon by the
! Republicans, of both houses should be re
i ported in its place.
It is politics, of course, for Democrats to
make as much of seeming divisions among
Republicans as possible. In this case,
however, they will have their trouble for
their pains. The division which seemed
so manifest in the vote on the bill has
been explained away by the debate. There
has been by the Senators of the East and
of the West a clear declaration in favor of
the principles of protection and bimetal
iism, and on that platform the united
party will in the future as in the past con
tinue to legislate for the welfare of the
people.
EVADING PAYMENT.
General Hubbard, speaking before the
House Committee on Pacific Roads, has
made many extraordinary declarations,
but the hardiest of all is that it is never
the policy of railroad companies to pay
the principal of their debts, but that the
sole aim is to keep the interest paid. If
this is really the policy of the railroads of
this country, Congress has a new and oriei
nal evil to handle, and General Hubbara
deserves the thanks of the country for
calling attention to it.
One of the fundamental objections to a
refunding of the railroad debts is the very
one that General Hubbard baa advanced in
favor of the proposition. Refunding would
be a recognition and indorsement of that
evil by the Government, and that would
be the setting apart of railroads as a class
from the operation of ordinary
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28. lKytf.
business principles, even in relations with
the Government. This would be giving
them an enormous advantage over other
creditors. A worse feature of refunding
would be the establishing of a precedent
for exempting stockholders in a corpora
tion from individual liability as such. The
laws of California and of other States im
pose snch a liability on stockholders.
Refunding would destroy that liability
and reduce the resources for recovery on a
deficiency judgment to the physical prop
erty mortgaged for the security of the
debts. To destroy that security is a sim
ple task for railroad managers. It would
be an extraordinary thing for the Congress
of the United States to take a course in
subvention of laws which a number of the
States have evolved from painful ex
perience.
General Hubbard's proposition. is daring
in the extreme. Applied to the refunding
biJls which he advocates it means that
even at the expiration of the fifty or a
hundred years to which it is proposed to
extend the time for paying the debt it
will not be expected by the successors of
the parties in interest that the debt will
be paid. On the contrary, one extension
of a debt fallen due will commit the Gov
ernment to further extensions. Worse
than that, the funding bills propose to
lend to men who have proved themselves
utterly untrustworthy a vast sum of
money at half the rate of interest which it
exacts from ordinary honest citizens. The
proposition is monstrous from every point
of view. The loanâ for an extension of
the debt is nothing but the making of a
new loan â is prouosed to be made to per
sons who have already defaulted on the
interest of the original loan and who have
crippled the Government's power of re
covery by deliberately impoverishing its
security. If there is an intelligent citizen
of the Tinted States, apart from the
schemers who' are urging this extraordi
nary policy, who is anxious to see it
adopted he may rest assured that his
name will have an unhappy perpetuation
in the history of the country.
EOBBING "CEMETEEIES.
A remarkable epidemic of grave-robbinÂ°
is afflicting the country. ' One of the most
sensational cases was recently furnished
by the medical department of Worces
ter University, Ohio. Only a few days ago
the grave in which a woman had been in
terred in this City was found open and
the body exposed, but the reason for the
act has never been ascertained. The most
remarkable story of all, and the least
credible, comes from Seattle and is to the
effect that a regular traffic in stolen
human bodies is carried on between per
sons ia Seattle and certain medical col
leges of San Francisco, and that the
bodies are shipped to this City by steamer.
While all this is going on the news
conies from Paris that the medical schools
have made a rule not to admit foreign
students who have not obtained the degree
of bachelor of arts or of bachelor of
sciences from pome approveu college, the
reason being that the laboratories are
overcrowded and that it is impossible to
secure a sufficient number of subjects for
dissection. If these cannot be found in
Paris where may they be sought?
One of the horrors which charity hospi
tals hold tor the unfortunate poor is the
reasonably aure prospect of fetching up on
a dissecting table at lasc, and yet these are
the principal source of suppiy for the
medical college. That failing, the tempta
tion to employ any one who undertakes to
deliver bodies to the colleges is very strong.
If the eyes of the college authorities are
closed there can be no sufficient safeguard
in such cases against a dangerous hand
ling of infectious diseases. While there is
probably a great deal less of this sort of
r-ookedness than b popularly supposed,
the fact that the Ohio institution undoubt
edly secured its subject by such means
cannot be overlooked.
It is not at all unlikely that such dis
coveries a 9 this will create a popular senti
ment which will require the cremation of
all pauper subjects. This would work a
very serious injury to the medical profes
sion', as dissection is an essential pan of
the instruction of students. "Body
snatching" will have a similar tendency
with those who otherwise would prefer to
inter their dead, but might be driven to
cremation by rear of ghouls. The estab
lishment of an adequate patrol of ceme
teries is certainly called for and might well
be required. by legislation.
A POEM BY CHARLES DUDLEY
WARNER.
It is not generally known that Mr. Charles
Dudley Warner sometimes drops into poetry
for the delectation of his friends, writes a cor
respondent of the Boston Herald. He has done
this to celebrate special occasions among them,
but has seldom allowed his effusions to appear
in print. We are strongly inclined, from in
ternal evidence, to suspect that the following
verses, which have just appeared in the Hart
ford Courant, are from his graceful pen:
THE DANCE OP THE BONNETS.
All np and down the brilliant house,
Tbrougb Circle, Box, Parquet,
BArowsand rows of waiting folk.
Men, Uairus. and damsels gay;
All with their bright, expectant looks,
Care-fret as if in story books,
Impatient for the Play.
At last the lights turned, suddeu, low,
The curlaiu upward went,
Each voice was hushed and ;-arment'B stir;
With eyes and ears intent
Upon the -jKtrk;nj_'. lovely scene
\s itli elfs and fays the brooks between,
tacli eager face was bent.
But one, aghast, eoulrl nothing see
Kxoopt a moustrous plunm:
While tlirei! red ros<-s hich nwave â
From Paris sltill abloomâ
Before another's straining eyes,
Wiili suut:y tilt and savage size,
1)1(1 loom, and loom, ami loom.
And hard by this another sat,
M<-t'k soul but now a-rage,
For two wide-spreading, fan-like wings
Concealed just half the stat;e.
Sometimes a player's head or hand
Or fragment of a dancing band
Would fall within his guuge.
One dame, behind a ribbon tower,
â ^â - - Felt honest, true amaze '
That thoughtful she of tiniest toque
. - Must thus be spoiled of gaze.
She knew not that her light aigrette
To eyes behind would only let
Things pass as through a haze.
And so the dance beganâ to right,
To leftâ right againâ
The flower, the feather, silken bow,
The wing of bright bird slain.
O weirU chu.s.se! row after row,
The bonnets come, the bonnets go,
Till curtain drops and- from' the show
Wend weary eyes and brain.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
The notorious Count de Toulouse Lnutrec,
otherwise Nicholas de Savin, who was here re
cently, and went to St. Louis at the solicita
tion of a big railroad supply manufacturing
firm, seems to have been dropped like a hot
potato on the banks of the Mississippi.
Reed Northup, Jay Gould's nephew, who
lives in St. Louis, and who has followed the
career 01 the alleged Count more or less
closely, nas been a guest at the Palace tor
some days. He says the St. Louisinns took up
the man for a time who played for the Bul
garian throve and wound up as a Siberian
convict, but when they found what they had
on their hands they let him go.
The nobleman has therefore passed on to
pastures which may possibly prove greener.
The Alleged Count dc Toulouse Lautrec, Otherwise Nicholas de Savin.
[Sketched from life b\j a " Call " artist.]
He is in Chicago, and a newspaper there has a
long story in reference to the Count. It shows
the curious wav the Count talks, with other
things, that will shed sidelights on his career.
It will be noticed that he nas a scheme.
"A king's job is the best in the world, and I
wanted to get Into it," laughed Count A. C.
Savine de Toulouse Lautrec as he sat in his
gorgeously furnished office on Michigan
avenue.
"I had everything arranged to be a king, but
the Russian Government objected. The Czar
sent his men an.l I was seized and thrust into
a dungeon in the prison of Peter aud I'aul in
Petersburg. For a while I languished in
the dungeon. Then I wrote to his Majesty
Alexander threeâ ah, third, you say. Said I
to Alexander: 'Why are you so harsh with me?
You have a great, big throneâ l wanted only a
little one. You have the softest snapâ is that
what you call it?â in the worldâ loo,ooo,ooo
people to rule and everything just as yoii de
sire. I only want to rule 3,000,000 or 4,000,
-000 and have things about half as I desire.
Can't we fix it up some way?' Then the Czar
laughed and stnt me to Siberia.'"
The Chicago paper add.s: "The 1 Count is
in Chicago as a contractor for the great
Siberian railway, and hopes to form a
syndicate to Improve the grand resources of
the dreaded wilderness of Asia. He is, accord
ing to all stories told of his career, one of the
most remarkable adventures of the nge, and,
withal, a most pleasant and genial gentleman,
lie it was who, years ago, plotted with the fa
mous Stambuioff for the crown of Bulgaria,
and, had nut his plans been betrayed, would
have been seated on that stormy throne. His
boldness in daring to presume to royal honors
was punished by imprisonment and exile, but
the Russian Government forgave him long a>;o
and he is now considered one of the most
prominent of Siberian business men.
"The room where the Count Bits, writes and
plans is intensely cold. The breath of the visitor
freezes as it passes his lips and his teeth chat
ter like castanets. Yet the Count sits there, in
his dressing-gown and slippers, as oomfortable
rs could be imagined. The landlady, ushering
in the casual visitor, whisperinglx explained:
'Excuse the cold room. The Count will have
it so â say's that's the way he has been used to
things at home.'
" 'Is it too cold?' the Count remarked, as he
ran his linger over a map of Siberia. 'Well,
we can have it warmer, but this room now is
uncomfortably hot to a man who has lived in
Siberia.
" 'I have lots to do In Chicago,' the Count
went on. '1 want to form a erand syndicate
and interest millions in the great Siberial rail
way, and I want to publish my history, not for
any pecuniary reasons, but because it would
make good reading. Think of all 1 have seen
and suffered. Think of the men 1 have met
and the nations I have teen among. Jtou;;ht
to be quite entertaining. No, lam not going
into the king business any more. I have had
enough and will stick where I am. What,
going? Come and see me again and look over
these maps of Siberia with me.'
"And the man who would be a king bowed
the way to the door like a chevalier of old."
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
THE VITICULTUBAI. LIBRARY.
The Secretary of the Late Commission Tells
What Was Done With It.
To the Editor of tfie San Francisco Callâ Sir :
I notice in The Call of the 26th inst. a state
ment to the effect that after turning over the
property of the Viiicultural Commissioners 10
the regents of the university, "the members of
the commission still retained the library," etc.
I wish you would correct this. When the
old Viticultural Commission expired by law, I,
as its secretary, turned over all of the property
to Secretary J. 11. C. Borne of the regents, and
I hold the receipt of the regents for the name.
It is the intention of the new College of Prac
tical Viticulture to proceed at once with the
creation of a new library. I know of many
â¢viticultunsts in this Jjtate who will contribute
to this collection now that they know that
politicians will have no hand in directing the
affairs oi the college, and that the necessity for
a biennial scramble at Sacramento is over.
Measures will be taken to make this new
library the equal of the old one, as far an this is
possible. There are some rare volumes that
are next to impossible to duplicate, but some
of these are valuable only as curiosities ana
can aa well be dispensed with. The object will
be to collect every work of standard merit at
first, and steadily add to the library as occa
sion offers.
On account of the error above mentioned I
have received an insulting message from A. P.
Haync of Berkeley, who, luuderstand, is Pro
fessor Hilgard's mouthpiece, but who other
wise would be unworthy of notice. As I have
Secretary Bonte's receipt for the library of the
old commission, and as but live books which
cost the State anything Were lost during my
five years* custodianship of tho books, in spite
of the fact that the library was stmi-public, it
is in decided bad judgment for insinuations
to emanate from Berkeley.

THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT.
A Scbject Who Feels Thoroughly Satisfied
With It.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
Is a humble and unpretentious specimen of
the genus homo Britannica, and withal an ad
mirer of tuis press-ruled country, mÂ»y I be
allowed to express through the" medium of
your columns my gratitude for your generous
tone in commenting on the probable outcome
of the trial of Captain Jameson and his fellows?
It comes all the more gratefully, too, that
it loUows, tardily, on a period when every
action of my countrymen â imaginary or
otherwiseâ has met with angry cummei.t
and wholesale denunciation. 1 think none
of my countrymen can have any possible
objection to legitimate criticism, but to
that kina of criticism which condemns first
and tries afterward we offer a mild protest.
As discretion is the better part of valor, let it
go at that.
We do lay claim, despite all assertions to the
contrary, to an equal appreciation of justice
with yourselves. That we are a successful col
onizing power, in fact, the only one, is suscepti
ble of proof. That wherever the British flag
floats there also is good government and free-
1 dom in the fullest meaning of the term. That
tbere is not.a British port the wide world over
in which your merchantmen are not as free to
trade bs are our own. That we nowhere place
obstacles in the way of commerce, irrespective
of source, la undeniable, and that we safeguard
the life and liberty of the stranger within our
gates is no mere play upon words. Further
more, we do not seek to acquire at the expense
of other responsible nations or communities
one single foot of territory.
That when we have met with rouph treat
ment aud injustice inflicted upon the indi
vidual persons of our it-llow-coniitrymen by
savage gentlemen like Ketehwayo, and have
found it necessary to assert and emphasize the
| value ot civilization, we ought su-rely not to
| be crltlefzsd by the people who have herded
the aborigines of this great country into res
ervations for their own and the general good
of the community. Finally may I be par
doned it I a<k you, Mr. Editor, and all those of
your readers who are fairminded, to consider
that in all essential points the British tiovern
ment interferes as little in the affairs of its
subjects as does the Government of these
United state-, with t lie additional safeguard
that an unpopulflr party cannot retain con
trol of the machinery of legislation for one
single hour after the voice ot the people has
bees declared against it in the House of Com
mons.
Trusting that the generous spirit which
I bare already referred to may animate not
only your facile pen. but surge through and
over your brethren oi the press, I remain,
A Scot Abroad.

A SONG OF TIME.
Weep not for the hereafterâ
The burden of the years;
I"or 'lime stays not for laujjhtpr,
And Time stays not for tears.
On swiftest pinions flying
lie speeds o'er land and sea;
Shall roses dead or dying
. Revive because of thee?
Cure not fnr sharp thorns springing;
To then be Ufa complete
If any bird is ftiiigin;;,
Aud any ruse is sweet.
What ma may come hereafter â 
Will come despite thy fears;
Time lingers not for laughter,
Arid Time stays not for tears.

LADY'S SHIRT WAIST.
This will be found a very becoming ivaist,
the fullness below the flat yoke mating it a
good shape, both for slender and stout figures.
Made of a colored chambray, say plain pink
or pink and white stripe, with cuffs and collar
of white, is the latest fancy. The collar and
cuffs may be made separate, simply binding
neck and sleeves and making the necessary
buttonholes in bands and the cuffs and collar.
Make a Bet to match and another of white
linen and twice the amount of service can be
gotten out of one waist.
Plain natural-colored linen is much used
this season, and some show a piping of white
around cult's, collar and yoke.

The Parnell Monument.
with sixteen large and powerful mirrors, eight
ot which are vertical and eight inclined at an
angle so as to reflect the sun's beams into Dub
lin and Wicklow. The effect, says the Dublin
World, will be that of a glittering jewel, illum
inating the country pud the coast, as "the
flash of Parnell'a genius" shed a luster on
Irish contemporary history. The mirrors will
be hermetically mounted' in bronze framen,
and the tower will be constructed of granite
from County Wicklow. Operations will be
begun as 6oon as the weather and the state of
the funds permit. Care will be taken not to
injure the exquisite outline of the mountain
as a feature in the landscape.

Dress.

Court yesterday when Mrs. F. M. Picker
ing appeared before Justice Carroll to de
fend herself in a suit brought by J. J.
Raver aÂ« assignee of Mme. Luenberger,
dressmaker. Mrs. Pickering wanted to go
to the horse show, and desiring to do jus
tice to the occasion ordered a gown of the
modiste. The latter claimed on the stand
that the dress when tried on fitted perfectly,
and was corroborated by her assistants,
tffce said, however, that Mrs. Pickering
was faultfinding to an unreasonable ex
tent and that there was no reason why the
dress stiould not have been accepted.
Mrs. Pickering, on tne other hand, tes
tified tliat the dress was illfnting when
?lip first tried it on, and that Mme. Luen
bereer's tinkering with it did not improve
masters. She Rinsed to accept or pay the
|;l"0 demandea by the dressmaker. The
Last time she tried it on and tola the dress
maker it would not do, when the latter
had flown at her and torn the dress vio
lently from her shoulders.
District Attorney Barnes, who repre
sented the defendant, crew eloquent over
the evils nod discomforts of a misfit dress,
and demanded judgment and justice for
(us fair cli-nt. Justice Carroll will give
judgment to-day.

kins, and Butler Miller, his slayer, did not
pose as the hero that all accounts of the
tragedy hitherto given has made him ap
]>ear.
On the contrary, he was from the open- i
ing question put to him by the Coroner
placed in the attitude of a defendant on
trial.
Captain Lees, chief of the detectives, has !
a theory that Miiler is guilty of having en
ticed the alleged burglar into the house
! and killed trim.â enticed him there for that
purpose.
The theory, so far from being a mere
theory, was supported by testimony of a !
startmgly direct character. A manâ a
tramp â was produced who said that on the
night preceding by one that uf the killing
he had been invited by Miiler to come to
the house with the promise of a reward.
He absolutely identified Milier and pro
duced a paper said to have been given him
by the butler, upon which directions were
written how to tind the house. This writ- i
ing was compared with others, which |
Miller acknowledged to be his own, and
they bear some striking points of similar
ity. Other evidence strongly corrobora
tive of this theory was presented.
On the other hand Miller denied all
I knowledge of Hays and hi 3 note and is
I supporter in his allegation of an alibi by
| the members of Franklin's family. Frank- i
I iin himself declares himself ready to stake j
his life and his fortune upon the boy's in
nocence.
As for Miller he carried himself through
| the ordeal with a quiet confidence, wholly
free from any sign of either fear or
bravadoâ like the modest hero that he still
is in the eyes of the Franklin family.
Miller was placed upon the stand im
mediately \ipon the impaneling of the ;
jury. He sat on the opposite side of a |
tabie, at which the Coroner, Captain Lees
jat his side, was seated. The young man
carried his hand in a sling and his
wounded throat was wrapped in white
bandages. He is a handsome yount;
fellow, with regular features molded on
strong lines, brown eyes and brown wavy
hair. His beardless lace was pale wljen he
took his seat and his attitude was one or
dejection, his head drooping, and eye-,
turned away from his questioner, rested
upon and followed the swift fingers of the
stenographer upon his left taking down
question and answer. â¢
With the lirst question of the inquisitor,
couched in the sharp,stern voice of tl.e prac
ticed prosecutor, ti.e blood bejran to rise
into the pale cheek of ;he witness, and
I continued so to uo until it turned a deep
j crimson as question by question followed
j one another, demanding the story of ni-s
whole pasi life.
Not that any answer to the whole list
gave occasion for shame, but he seemed to
feel that he was defendant there.
Gradually, however, lie aroused himself
under this realization, and after a time j
I turned to face his questioner, and allowed
i his eves to rest upon him in a level, steady
j way tHat had the effect of taking some
! thins: from the sharpness of the inquiry.
By the time the questioning had covered
the space of the young man's past life and
j the night of the burglary had been reached
'.he merest bearing and frank answers of
the young butler had won him the sympa
thj of the audience. It was cvi ient t;.at
be was feeling the sharp tone of the in- j
quiry, but he had not been betrayed irt.-> j
liv- slightest disposition to make a sharp i
retort or an evasion. He told the sti.rv of
his encounter with three burglars, and of
one of them being leit with a revolver at
nis head to guard him, and of how tie,
taking his opportunity, attacked the man
and wrestled with and exchanged s:.ots
with him until he became unconscious.
Then Captain Lees whispered to the
Coroner, and the Coroner asked him to
Illustrate upon the body of O. H. Eejrne
man, Captain Lets private secretary, just
iiow he made the attack. Heyneriiun
stood up. He is a slim, but well built
young fellow of six feet in height. Miller
rose up.
Miller, not so tall as the other by
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28. 1896.
several inches, but considerably broader
across the shoulders, wearing a long, blue
overcoat, his right anr in the sling, ad
vanced quietly, took nold of Heyneman's
right hand, and by a single dexterous
movement twirled the stronger man about
and secured his head under his arm.
Captain Lees had been watching and di
recting the progress of the inquiry up to
this point with the confident air of a con
noisseur in crime and an expert in human
nature, awaiting an expected confession
from this voting man. His attitude and
expression changed.
'â¢How was that?" he asked.
Wilier did the tricK again.
"And show us how you recovered your
revolver and snot in that position."
Miller felt his opportunity and, with
little attempt at gentleness, he diagged
Heyneman to the ttoor\ while, in mock
fashion, he groped with his lame arm for
his revolver.
The audience laughed with delight.
"Oil, I could do it with most any man,"
said Miller, proudly, as he released the
disconcerted private secretary.
The examination began with Miller's
previous employments and went back to
the time of nis father's death at Plymouth,
Conn., when he (the son) was 9 years of
age. He had had but a few years of
schooling at that time, when he was com
pelled to earn his own living; had worked
in New York and Chicago and Portland,
in various menial employments, until, a
little more than a year ago. he enteied the
service of Mr. Franklin. He repeated the
Btory of the night of the burglary prac
tically as it has been told; how he was
awakened early in the evening by Mr.
Franklin, who was ill, moving about
the house, advised him to postpone a
journey contemplated for the next
day, retired again, got up at shortly be
fore 5 o'clock, tried to turn on the electric
light, it failed, went into the hallway, en
countered the three burglars who held
Mm up, two of them went upstairs leav
ing aim with tiie third, how he attacked
him in the manner illustrated and both
kept tiring until he became unconscious.
'I did not know that I was shot. I sim
ply felt- drowsy and seemed to go to sleep,"
he said. 'When I awakened the family
was nil about me." ~
"How tall was the man ?" asked the Cor
oner.
Miller stood up. "I do not know," tie
said. "1 could not see over his hat."
"Oh, sit down," said the Coroner.
â¢ Miller said he did not hear the name
"Matt'' or any other name used between
the men. He explained that he got his
revolver from a needy man at the hotel at
which he worked in Chicagoâ paid him $3
on it.
Captain Lees undid the package contain
ing both the weaiHjns used in the deadly
duel and Miiler readily picked out his
own.
"Whose revolver is the other?"
''I don't know."
"Where diet you cet it?"
"In the house on California street."
"Well, what houseâ what's the num
ber?''
Miller gave the numberâ 293o.
"Who put it where you then saw it?"
"I don't know."
"Well, well, is he alive? What Has
become of him ?"
"I know that he is dead"â quietly.
Then they spiang their surprise. ' At the
back of Captain Lees a young man of slim
figure, swarthy complexion and small
black eyes, wearing the habit of a tramp,
came forward in 4 a shambling, stoop
shouldered way, twirling a greasy hat, and
stood directly in front of Miller.
"Did you ever see this man?"
Miller looked at him steadily. "No. sir,
i did not."
"You didn't meet him on the corner of
Hayes, Who Claimed to Have Received an Offer of S3 and a Suit of Clothes From
Aliller
Sacramento snd Kearny streets on Tues
day night prereiing the alleged burglary,
and asK him to come out to the house on
: Caiiiornia stre<-t?"
"No, sir, I was not out of the house that
night."
"is this your handwriting," on a small,
ragged piece of brown paper.
"No, sir."
Some notebooks and an account were
shown to him, which he acknowledged to
be in his own writing.
Then Miller was told to stand aside and
i the tramp was placed on the stand. Siiiv
| erin<? with ner%'ous:iesÃ, he said his name
was Franklin Hayes.
"I was asking alms from men on the
j street on Tuesday night when this man,
I MiLer, came along. I tackled him. He
I said I was giving him dirt. I went along
! with him and asked him how. We turned
i tip Sacramento street and he said to me.
j 'You can make a suit of clothes and $5
easy if you will come out to a certain house,
on California street, near Baker, to
morrow and carry away two bundles for
me.' 1 told him I would do a great deal
! for |5 and a suit of clothes. He said I
! must come between 7 and 8 o'clock,
; come around to the back porch and wait
! for him till he came out, making no
noise. I sail I would not make any
noise as I could walk on the grass. He
i told me there w:is no grass there. I
â¢ agreed. Then lie stooped and picked ut> a
; small piece of a paper bag and started to
; write in his hand. He could not do it
| well and placed it against a lamp-post
I and wrote the directions how to get
j tnere. He then gave me 10 cents for ray
; carfare and we parted. Well, I didn't go.
I I tniked it over with some chums in a
â  saloon and they advised me not to do it as
it was rather mysterious and might get
me into trouble. As soon as I saw the
picture in the paper the next Friday I
saH "That is the man.' "
In answer to a juryman Hayes said he!
was telling his :-tory of his own free will. I
; He had talked about the affair among the !
| hackmen and others, and it got to the ears
i of the police and he was locked up.
In answer to questions from Captain
Lees the witness said that a number of
photographs had been shown to him out j
of whfcii he picked two as being like the i
man he had met and one of the pictures j
was that of Miller. The meeting with j
Miller was between 10 o'clock and mid- i
night; there was plenty of light so that he j
could not be mistaken m the identification.
He had never seen Miller i-.fterward until
he got out of the carriage to come to this
inquest.
Ail this time Mr. Franklin, the boy's
employer, who sat near, was laboring un- j
der the most intense excitement. "This j
makes me sirk," he would whisper to !
those about him. ''The idea of a fellow !
â  like that swearing away the life of ray boy. j
Why, my boy never eoes out at night. He j
has 'no had habits, does not use tobacco, j
has not bnen out as late as 11 o'clock since j
he has been in my employ. This is out- j
rageous. J know it is false. I would stake
my life upon it."
Officers Green and O'Connor told their
story of going to the sceneâ the first dis
covering the men and calling for the patrol !
wagon, the latter finding the masks, one j
beside the insensible burelar and the other j
in. trie hall above; also of finding a black !
veil on the sidewalk outside.
Dr. Washington Dodge testified to hav
ing been summoned to treat Miller, find
i ing him unconscious or partially so, suf- !
| ferinsr from a wound in the neck. The [
j wound was of a nature that ordinarily |
j would not cause a man to faint, but he !
! knew Miller to be afflicted with a peculiar
nervous disorder from having treated hiro
a year previously for an attack that ren
dered him unconscious. This would ex
plain the symptom. On the occasion I
referred to, the doctor said, Miller hat! !
! had an interview with the police extend- '
ing through several hours, and when he |
; returned home he was overcome with this
; attack of â not exactly epilepsy, but some
thins akin to it, produced by what in a \
woman might be called hysteric?. It was
j attended by partial unconsciousness and
j the patient gave vent to a peculiar noise
and his limbs twitched.
"Would such an animated encounter as
we have witnessed here produce this
effect?" asked Captain Lees.
The doctor hardly thought so.
Coroner Hawkins asked if epileptics '
were not usually subject to delusions.
The witness saii they sometim.es were,
biK he would not say it was usually the
1 case.
Dr. Max Solomon, the family physician,
I testified to attending the patient ("Miller)
| after the shooting. He found him un
conscious at his first call and he was st'll so j
when be called again at noon. He sue- |
, cceded in rousing him, however, for an in
stant and tUe boy's first words were
"There art- tÂ«vo upstairs."' He said that
the nail on his right thumb was torn com
! pletely out ana gave the patient great
| pain.
Dr. Davis testified to treating the patient
! in the first instance.
Jennie Sbafer, a one-time nurse in the
family, added something to ihe sensation
sprung by the appearance and testimony
of Hayes. She had been engaged by the
family a few days before the affair. She
said she was of a very nervous tempera
ment. She had had a conversation with
Miller a day or so before the shooting and
he told her about the previous visit of
burglars to the place. She had compli
mented him on his nerve and he had said
something about receiving only $2o a
month. Then she went on to say that
Miller was out on the night of Tuesday,
the night Hayes alleges be met him.
She says she was writing a letter that
night and remained up late herself. ShÂ»
retired to her own room at 5 minutes to 11
! and he had not come in yet. He was not
I out the next ni^'ht, Wednesday, but on
, Thursday ni-_'ht, the night of the shooting,
be did not come in until a quarter to 11.
! She said she had tried to put her hand
| through the opening in the screen and j
; tiie hroken glass of the back kitchen-door
j through which the ourglars are supposed
to have effected an entrance, but she could
only get three fingers into the crevice.
Rena Mohr, another nurse in the family,
said she thrust her full hand through the
opening, but could not use her ringers.
John Tcdt, a locksmith, was shown the
bunch of keys and bent wire found in the
hall with the masks, and said they were
evidently not made by a professional lock
smith. He would not ca!i the wires lock
picks, as they could scarcely be used for
that purpose.
Joseph Oswald said that there were no
skeleton-keys in the assortment and they
could not be usea except on a common
loclc. They were evidently the work of an
amateur.
A piece of wire formerly a part of a col
lender used in the family was shown. It
compared closely frith the wire of which
the lockpicks were made.
Dr. Cohen was called. He had been
called to attend Miller in 1*94, when he
waÃ supposed to be suffering from an
epileptic fit. He was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital, but revived immediately
when placed on the operating table.
'â¢What do you think of that attack?"
asked Coroner Hawkins.
''Well, I think it was not well played."
"You tnink he was feicning then?"
"Yes. or it might have been hystero-
Captain Lees then took the stand and
told of his examination of the scene of the
crime and what conclusions it had led him
to. He told o: the small crevice cut in the
kitchen door, and declared that it would
be impossible to reach the key or bolt,
some Inches from it. through the opening.
"That door was unlocked from the inside.
not the outside," he said. "The door lead
in;; to the hallway from the kitchen had
been cut in a manner that would not aid
in opening it, besides the brass bolt and
plate bore no scratch or other sign of hav
ing been forced. The electric light wires
were cut in the kitchen and ttie gas t Jined
of at the meter under th- front step, and
the telephone wires cut upstairsâ the first
cat leaving whoever did it in darkness.
They must have been familiar with tue lo
cation of the wires.
"It is a mystery to me," he sai^, "as I
have made this investigation with thor
oughness and impartiality." A piece of
candle, he said, had been found in the
hallway. "I have not told Mr. Franklin
of the convictions that this investigation
has forced on me, because I thought it
would do nogood,aqd should all come out
under oath. Those lockpicks I do not
consider of any use for the purpose, l
know something about such tools, but I
thought best to call in regular locksmiths
The inquest here adjourned until this
morning at 9:30 o'clock. In the afternoon
the jury, led by Captain Lees and attended
!<v a Deputy Coroner, visited the house of
Mr. Franklin and looked over the ground
as described by Captain Lees.
While they were in the house young
Miller remained in a room upstairs.
Speaking of the testimony of the nurse
woman as to his being out on the Tuesday
evening referred to by Hayes, Miller said :
"I was not out that night. 1 supplied the
woman with ink to write her fetter. 1
think I told her i was going out but did
not do so. I was in bed at half- past 9
o'clock. On Thursday nignt I went to the
barber's on Devisadero and California
streets, but found it closed. 1 got a $5
piece changed for one of the family on
Fillmors street and returned home. 1 have
never been out at 11 o'clock at night. In
the evening at 7 o'clock I am engaged in
waiting at the table at dinner and after
war I tret my own dinner."
Miller by request wrote the words that
are on the paper alleged to have been given
by him to Hayes, by which a comparison
of his handwriting 'might be made.
Captain Lees said last night that he
would to-day produce at the inquest a
number of tools and articles found in the
Franklin residence. Among them are a
vise and pair of pincers which he thinks
could have been used in making the picu
locks found as a part of the supposed bur
glars' lools.
It is said that Miller may be arrested to
day. Mr. Franklin will secure the services
of an attorney for him.
DEATH OF J. N. GREGORY.
A Young Society Man Has Suc
cumbed to Pneumonia in
the Mines,
The Ex-Manager for the H. S. Crocker
Co. Died Very Suddenly at
Cripple Creek.
James N. Gregory, who for six years
was at the head of the salesmen's depart
ment at the H. S. Crocker Co., died on
J. N". Gregory.
"Wednesday afternoon in Cripple CreeK,
Colo. The news of his death was thor
oughly unexpected and has come in the
nature of a thunderbolt to his wife, family
and friends.
At the beginning of the year the de
ceased secured a leave of absence to spend
tx few mouths in the East, and after visit
ing Boston, Philadelphia, New York and
Denver he decided to look in at Cripple
Creek, where the mining excitement is at
its height. He had been there but a week,
and his wife, who is stopping in this City
with her brother-in-law, Robert Wieland,
received most glowing letters from him as
to the country he was in and as to his
health. His k-tters, however, dropped off
three days ago, and the first intimation
received that anytiiing was wrong came
to Robert Wieland late Wednesday night
from a Mr. Lapman, who is unknown to
him, but who wired:
J. N. Grcjrory is dead. What disposition shall
be made of his remains?
Subsequent telegrams brought the news
that Gregory had been sick but two days.
He had been laid low by pneumonia, the
sickness which is said to be killing the
strangers in Cripple Creek at the rate of
one an hour.
Robert Wieland. the eldest son of the
late brewer, John Wleland, is a relative by
marriage of the deceased. Wicland mar
ried Miss Lucille Buckley of Oakland, who
died a few months ago, and Gregory mar
ried her sister.
Gregory came to this City from New-
Jersey some sixteen years a.:o, when about
23 yearg of age. He became best known
When, at the beginning of the decade, he
entered the employ of H. S. Crocker &
Co. He was blessed with more than usual
good looks, and was a brilliant conversa
tionalist. He made his w;iy into the
smart set, where he and his wife were
great favorites.
Although married n2arly thirteen years,
they have had no children. The deceased
was a member of most of the choice social
club 3of this City.
Robert Wieland wired to Cripple Creek
yesterday to embalm the remains and send
them ou to this City.
A POINT ON UNCLE SAM.
Money Was Paid Unnecessarily
for the Transportation of
Marines.
QUESTIONS FOR THE SENATE.
Government Roads Were Passed By
While the Southern Pacific Got
the Contract.
Local railway men are curious to know
what will be the outcome of the investiga
tion of the Southern Pacific Company for
violation of the interstate commerce act.
J. C. Stubbs, third vice-president of the
company, was sunimoned from New
Orleans to appear before the Interstate
Commerce Commission in Chicago and
show cause why the Southern Pacific
should not be punished for violating the
law. He is now understood to be on the
rack in Chicago, just as his "boss" is in
"Washington.
A new aspect has been put upon the
case in question which, it is held by rail
way men, gives the investigation a sig
nificance not previously dreamed of. It is
this:
The United States law has been grossly
broken by the Southern Pacific transport
ing United States sailors over its southern
route at reduced fares, and besides, the
United States has been doubly hood
winked in the transaction. In violating
the interstate law the Southern Pacific cut
the sailors' fares to such a figure that niaue
it next to impossible to transport these
passengers over the Central roads in com
bination with lines that would not under
take to enter into such a conspiracy.
In this way the Union Pacific and Cen
tral Pacific were cheated out of the total
sums received from the transportation of
two parties of United States sailors numer
ous enough to fiii two large trains.
Everybody knows that the Union Pacific
and Central Pacific were built with Gov
ernment money and are virtually Govern
ment roads. If there were any roads in
the United States entitled to* a share of
the profits accruing from hauling the two
trains oi marines they are the ones. They
form a continuous line from San Francisco
to Omaha, and the only direct route across
the continent. In lace of all this, how
ever, the Southern Pacific took the Gov
ernment marines around two sides of a
triangle in a circuitous route to get money
for its own lines at the expense of the
United States roads, and in doing so vio
lated the law and tfte rules of the Western
Passenger Association.
"Here is a clear case of diverting busi
ness from the Central Pacific," remarked
a railway official. "Here you have the
acme of Southern Pacific gali. A Govern
ment road, Government troops, Govern
ment money. Only the troops and the
money are separated from the road.
"Senator Morgan or Congressman Ma
guira ought to have this point for a ques
tion tor Huntington. Suppose Morgan
should ask:
" 'You say you are not diverting busi
ness from the Central Pacific?'
" 'No.' Huntington would reply.
" Then how can you account for divert
ing Government money paid for trans
portation of United States marines from
the Cc ltral Pacinc to your own treasury?'
"Then there would "be a grand climax.
I'd iine to hear Huntington's explana
tion."
STBUCK BY A CAR.
Serious Accident to John Morris, a
Machinist.
John Morris, a machinist livinc at 1523
Eddy street, met with a serious accident
at Polk and Grove streets last night. He
and a friend were crossing Polk street to
take a car goins out to the Mission. The
friend was walking in front of Morris, who
aid not observe a car rounding the curve
on its way to Montgomery street. The
friend got safely across the track, but Mor
ris was strucK by the car and knocked
down. His head struck the ground with
great force. The gripmsn applied the
brakes at once, which saved Morris from
ueing mangled by the wheels.
Morris was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital in a semiconscious condition. He
was suffering from internal injuries, and
Dr. Burnell thought he might have sus
tained a fracture of the base of the skull.
Albreiht Pleaded Guilty.
Frod Albrecht, who was charged with gelling
an interest in a laundry, the principal busi
ness of which was represented by a number of
parcels filled with rags, pleaded'guilty before
Judge Baiirs yesterday. His plea was to a
charge of obtaining money under false pre
tenses to an amount less tuan .SSO. This is a
misdemeanor. He will be sentenced Febru

MISS OVERMAN'S
PECULIAR STORY.
Says to the Council That
She Was a Thief and
Forger.
REPENTS OF BLACKMAIL
The Witness Delivers Her State
ment With Apparent
Earnestness.
TUNNELL LETTERS EXPLAINED
Miss Hattie Cooper Appears as a Wit
ness â The Hearing to Be Re-
sumed To-Day.
Mattie Overman is the first self-confessed
blackmailerâ in heart, at leastâ in the
Brown-Davidson scandal. Last night she
told the council called to. determine the
guilt or innocence of Dr. Charles O. Brown
in the m;uter oi certain alleged immoral
conduct one of the. most remarkable
stories ever beard in ricrion or told in
criminal jurisprudence.
With a calmness which seemed at times
. 1, yet never nervous, she acknowl
edged i his, and almost in the same breath
put herself oji record as being a thief and
a forger. â 
When ?he ascended the stand every eye
was strained and every neck was craned to
see her. The councilmen drew their chairs
closer until they formed a half-circle about
the all-important witness.
Then she began her story. She asked
permission to tell it her own way without
interruption, except such assistance as
could be gained by occasional references to
Mrs. Thurston 's damaging testimony. *
Miss Overman began with her tirst meet
ing with Mrs. Tunnell and Mrs. Davidson,
gradually leading up to the grand climax,
where she acknowiedged that, acting
under the influence of Mrs. Davidson, she
hud consented to defame the character of
the man she loved.
She denied emphatically ever having
told Mrs. Thurston that Dr. Brown had at
any time professed ether than friendship
for her, or that he had made the least de
monstration of affection as alleged.
"I miaht have told her," she said, "that
I was disappointed because Dr. Brown did
not do these things; that is, did not hug
me."
She said that she came to San Francisco
on account of ill health, intending to
return to Tacoma at the end of a few
weetcs. She took up her residence, how
ever, at Dr. Brown's. At various times
she assisted him in his studies and after a
while began to think more of him than
she should hÂ«ve done, knowing him to be
a married man. She disclaimed having
told Mrs. Thurston that she Intended
going to Tacoma as a niece of Dr. Brown's,
but did say that a3 a member of the family
she could go at half fare.
On her return from Tncoma she vent to
live with Mrs. Davidson. Almost im
mediately that lady told her of the troubles
v o irst CoD Kregational Churchâ the
lienon-Strauss and Simpson episode.
"Mrs. Davidson talked a -Treat deai about
Dr. lirown and of my affection for him "
continued Miss Overman, "and tried to tret
me to cay that he reciprocated it. This I
would not do because it was untrue."
Then Miss Overman told of how Mrs.
Davidson broached a little scheme which
she had on foot, wberebv a 10l of money
could be made. Mrs. Davidson declared
that she had a splendid foundation for a
good story, as .she had of:en done such
â¢work for Eastern papers.
"We must have talked about the matter
for an hour," said Miss Overman '"md it
wns finally agreed that Mrs. Davidson
should manage the entire affair. In brief
however, I may say that we entered into a
.-chenie to blackmail Dr. Brown. - Then it
was that she actually laid the foundation
of the paper story and general blackmail
ing scheme. Mrs. Davidson was to write
this and I was to taue it to the Chronicle
and offer it for sale. I was afraid that it
would be published, but she assured me
thfct they would go to the party interested
and L'pt back the money paid to us and
more besides. â 
"I was to charge $2000 for this story, but
when I reached the office my courage
failed, and I only asked that $1000 be
jaid."
i hen Miss Overman described in detail
the famous Tunnell-Overman letters. She
?aid that Mrs. Davidson insisted that they
should have some hold on Dr. Brown, and
the only way to secure this was to write
strong letter: showing criminal relations.
Tlieae letters must first begin witli friend
ship, then love, foiiowed by an absorbing
passion, the whole ending with a grand
climax otcriminahty.
Miss Overman had written letters, she
paid, to Mrs. Davidson and Mrs. Tunnell,
which were to be utilized in perfecting the
piot.
She first rewrote letters to Mrs. David
son containing all of the subject-matter
mentioned above. Then came the ques
tion of introducing the same into the let
ters she had written Mrs. Tunnell.
"There was only one way to do this,"
said Miss Overman, "and that was by ex
tracting the letters 1 had written that lady
from her room. I knew where those let
ters wtre, so this part of the scheme was
easy to overcome. I secured them and â
the rest is known.''
Miss Overman then went into detail
concerning the advice offered by Mrs.
Davidson as to what should be placed in
these letters. When the work of forging
Dr. Brown's chains was completed these
letters were carefully carried back to Mrs.
Tunneil's room and* replaced in the pack
age from which they had been abstracted.
The witness went on to relate how she
suddenly became stricken with remorse at
the foul plot into which she had entered
ana of her determination not to go any
further with it. She declared that she
tola Mrs. Davidson of this conscience
pricking, whereupon that lady became
greatly indignant and threatened all man
ner of harsh things. At length, however,
Mrs. Davidaon declared that she had been
acting under the influence of the evil
spirit, that she knew the blackmailing
scheme- was wrong and she hoped Goo
would forgive her. They would think no
more about it.
Throughout the recital of this wonderful
story Miss Overman betrayed not the
slightest emotion. She seemed to be
rather amused than otherwise. She de
clined to face the audience, though
whether this was through natural modesty
or a desire that her words should only be
heard by the council is not known.
At times Dr. Brown proffered a kindly
word of advice, suggestion or encourage
ment, as the occasion seemed to demand.
The reverend gentleman was visibly affect
ed during the recital of these, to the lis
teners at. least, unexpected disclosures, his
breast heaving a ud sighs audible tc those
around him escaping.
.Miss Overman had just reached the in
teresting part of her story â that is explain
ing Mrs. Tunneil's connection with the
case, when the moderator announced the
hour of adjournment.
She will be placed on the stand to-day,
and presumably will consume the entire
afternoon session in explaininsother loose
ends of the alleged conspiracy.
THE PROCEEDINGS.
Testimony as to the Intimacy Be
tween Mrs. Tunnell and Miss
Overman.
After the reading of the minutes Dr.
Brown arose pnd said:
"1 think that one statement in the min
utes is incorrect. You will kindly read
what is said concerning the testimony of
Mrs. Thurston."
Scribe Hatch read the passage in the
minutes to the effect that Mrs. Thurston
testified that Miss Overman had confessed
herself deeply in love with Dr. Brown, and
that Dr. Brown reciprocated her love.
Judge Advocate Woodhams suggested
that it would be unnecessary to incorpo
rate any of the substance of the testimony
in the minutes.
A motion to the effect that the substance
MISS COOPKR.
of the testimony should not be incorpo
rated in the minutes was made and carried
unanimously.
Rev. E. li. Dille, pastor of the Central
Methodist Church, waÂ« called as the first
witness.
After the preliminary questions Dr.
Brown asked: "Did Mrs. Buxton ever tell
you at any time, Dr. Diile, that Mrs. C. B.
Thurston and her husband had attempted
to wrong you a year ago?"
Judge Advocate Woodhams objected to
this testimony as hearsay.
Dr. Brown explained that his object was
to show that there existed on the part of
Mrs. Thurston a disposition to criticize
and rind fault with and attempt to injure
a regular minister of the Gospel, and that
if he were permitted he would show that
Mrs. Thurston and her husband were en
gaged a year ago "in an attempt to slander
the gentleman who is now on this plat
form," added the doctor impressively.
The judee advocate renewed his objec
tion that if there were to be an attempt to
impeach the testimony of witnesses the
attempt should be made legally. It was
simply hearsay matter and would tangle
up the council with outside issues.
A witness could not be im ocached, he
said, by a recital of particular acts. It
could be done in only two ways, one by
showing that the reputation of the witness
for truth, honesty and integrity was bad,
and another by bringing in evidence
directly in contradiction of the evidence
presented by the witness.
"I understand," added the judge advo
cate, "that she swore last night she had no
enmity toward ministers of the Gospel,
and if it could be shown that she had said
otherwise then it would seem to me that it
would be proper."
"We have been frequently reminded,"
pursued Dr. Brown, "that we are not pro
ceeding upon strictly legal lines in the
examination of witnesses, and I don't
know whether we should now be confined
to legal lines as to that which would
impeach the testimony of witnesses. It
seems to me to be quite as conclusive to
show that she had been antagonistic to
ministers of the Gospel. I am ready to
show that she, with her husband, was pre
pared to affirm that Dr. Dille a year ago did
attempt to cheat a widow, whose very
name Dr. Dille doesn't know."
Dr. brown explained further that the
making of the charge against Dr. Dilie
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1896.
I Miss Mattie Overman Occupies the Witness-stand, to the Intense Interest of the
Spectators.
had been prevented W a mutual friend of
the parties. It seemed to be a very im
portant thing to have in evidence.
Moderator McLean :^ked whether Dr.
Browi could also .say that those persons
practically knew that there was no founda
tion for the charges.
"I am ready to show that by the witness
on the stand," was Dr. Brown's response.
"Was it a malignant attack?" asked the
moderator. "Was it possible that to the
best of their knowledge they believed it to
be true at the time? Might* they not have
been mistaken instead of malignant? It
is a very supposable thing that j>ersons in
good faith may make charges against
another, charges not true, but. which they
believed to be true. I am prepared to
allow Dr. Brown more time in which to
produce evidence that it was a malignant
attack."
The judge advocate remarked that the
trial should not be muddled by going into
all these outside matters. Other witnesses
might be attacked in the same way, and it
would require months of inquiry into
these and other irrelevant matters before
they could be straightened out. The judge
advocate continued:
"I know that I seem to be attacking Dr.
Brown when I make those objections.
I made them before, and when Dr. lirown
comes on with his witnesses I shall cer
tainly make the same objections."
The moderator said that the case seemed
so clear to him that he would rule in ac
cordance with the objections of the judge
advocate without putting the question to
the council, and there being no protest
the matter was accordingly decided in that
way.
Dr. Brown raised considerable laughter
and applause by remarking cheerfully, "I
don't propose to depend upon witnesses
whose characters can be impeached."
Judge Advocate Woodhams asked Rev. j
Dr. Dille whether he had ever heard Mrs. i
Tlmrston's reputation for truth, honesty >
and integrity discussed ia a general wav
and he replied that he had not.
Mrs. Elizabeth Gordon testified that
Mrs. Tunnell assisted her in the Co-opera- !
tive restaurant on Mission street for a
week. On the 28th of the month Mrs.
Tunnell left the place and tokl the witness
that she had to go away on very particular
business. Hhe went away very suddenly
and Miss Mattie Overman went with her.
During the week in which Mrs. Tunnell
worked there Miss Overman came to the
rsstaurant and took her meal? there, but
the witness could not say how many meals i
she had taken there. She and Miss Over- 'â 
man held frequent conversations in pri
vate. All that they toid the witness was
that they had iiad a suite of rooms in the
Cosmopolitan Hotel. It was Mrs. Tunnell
who brought If iss Overman there and in
troduced her to the witness. When Mrs. I
Tunnell left she said she was going away ;
on very particular business.
"You don't know, of your own knowl
edge, that they stopped at the Cosmopol
itan Hotel for even one day ?" asked Dr.
Brown.
"No, sir," replied the witness.
"Did Miss Overman take nÂ»Â»als at the
restaurant more than four days?"
"Yes, sir."
"More than rive days?"
"I don't know."
"You are absolutely sure that she took
her meals there on the 23d of December? "
"Yes, sir."
"Lunch, breakfast and dinner on the
23d?"
"To the best of my knowledge, yes."
Mrs. Gordon, in answer to further ques
tions of Dr. Brown, said Miss Overman
was in the restaurant every day with Mrs.
Tunnell from December 23 to December 23.
Mrs. George Barton was called for, but
did not respond.
At this stage of the proceedings Judge
Advocate Woodhams announced that that
was all the evidence he had to offer at
that time. He was ready to proceed with
the defense, with the understanding that
positive and direct testimony of good char
acter for the defense should be presented.
He had personally left a notice with Mrs.
Barton to appear, and he had used all the
diligence which the time at his command
had allowed him. Witnesses seemed to
be reluctant to come forward, and on that
account he suggested that some person in
authority should be instructed to summon
them and at the same time inform them
as to their rights.
After further discussion as to the ar
rangements for proceeding with the re
mainder of the case Rev. Mr. Pond asked
whether all the testimony extant had been
secured on the point ot Dr. Brown's al
leged remarks of commendation regarding
Mrs. Davidson after her famous interview
with him to the effect that she was a spir
itually inclined woman, and also similar
expressions concerning Mrs. Stockton.
Mr. Woodhams replied that he had no
testimony on that point. Mrs. French's
son was spoken of as likely to know about
that.
Mr. Pond remarked that the charges were
serious and he had hoped that they would
be refuted in some way.
Moderator McLean assured the council
that further diligence would be used on
the part of the proper authorities to obtain
all the evidence available. It was a trial
to which most people did not come volun
tarily.
Mrs. Cooper was recalled, and was asked
by Dr. Brown as to her statement that she
had not employed Mrs. Stockton in kinder
garten work on her return from the north
because no new schools had been opened.
He called her attention to a pamphlet
issued for that year showing that ten new
kindergarten schools had been established.
Mrs. Cooper, in explanation of the ap
parent inconsistency, explained that sev
eral of these schools were in the same
buildings with schools already established
and were attended to by the same teachers.
Orhers were tauÂ«ht by teachers selected
by ladies who had organized the new
schools and who were supporting them.
Another appointment was that of Laura
Richards, who was too petite for regular
public school work and who had a widowed
mother to support.
Miss Hattie Cooper was the next wit
ness. She had gone to 1041 Mission street,
and when the door was opened she saw a
card with the writing, "Prepare to Meet
my God.
"I was not afraid," continued Miss
Cooper, "and I asked: 'Is this the Chris
tian Co-operative restaurant? 1 'No,' the
lady replied, 'it's bust up.' " A man in the
place tola her that the restaurant had been
sold out.
The rest of her evidence was hearsay, be
ing what she had been told about Miss
Overman and Mrs. Tunnell being so inti
mate, and developed nothing that was
new. She said, among other things, that
Mr. Beechetof the Chronicle had discov
ered that Dr. Brown let Mrs. Tunnell out
of a door under the front steps of his house
in time to take the 11:80 o'clock boat for
Oakland. Mr. Sullivan of the Examiner
told her that Dr. Brown had admitted that
Mrs. Tunnell was in Dr. Brown's house on
that Sunday evening, December 29.
The witness believed that Mrs. Jones,
Mrs. Scott and Mrs. Baddin were one and
the same person. She had been informed
that Mrs. Jones had been located in a
lodging-house on Broadway in Los An
geles.
"" Deacon E. C. Williams testified as to
the manner in which Mrs. Eaton had
given her testimony. It had been ex
tracted from her by the committee by
question and answer.
The judge advocate then announced
that the case against Dr. Brown was
closed. Tliere were more witnesses, he
said, who may be called in rebuttal, but
the main testimony was in.
Dr. Brown then called his witnesses in
rapid succession. Mrs. Eunice H. Folger,
Miss E. Henderson, Mrs Ruby Rogers,
Deacon J. H. Barnett and Rev. John Kim
ball all swcre that they had never heard
any rumor to the effect that Dr. Brown
had any undue regard for Mrs. Stockton
or had ever seen him in her company on
the street or elsewhere or alone with any
woman other than his wife.
In response to a question by Rev. Mr.
Pond Kcv. Mr. Hoyt announced that Mr.
McMillan, who had interrnpted the meet
ing on the night before, had appeared and
made a statement to the committee.
The moderator paid that Mr. McMillan
was entitled to be heard in vindication* of
his own reputation, because his name had
been projected into the case. He asked
whether Mr. McMillan desired his state
ment repeated before the council, and Mr.
McMillan from the body of the house an
nounced that lie did. He desired to con
tradict Dr. Brown's statement that he had
been with Mrs. Stockton in the Grand
Hotel.
At this juncture Lawyer Nagle declared
that it was he who had" suggested McMil
lan's name to Dr. Brown, and that lie,
Nagta, was responsible for the use of Mc-
Millan's name.
"I don't care whether you are responsi
ble or Dr. Brown," retorted McMillen. "I
want to be put on the stand. "
Judge Advocate Woodhams was called
to the stand, and corroborated the testi
mony of the witnesses immediately pre
ceding as to their never having seen Dr.
Brown paying attentions to Mrs. Stockton.
After prayer by Dr. Rader at the open
ing of the evening session, Miss Overman
was called to the stand. She occupied the
attention of the council for the entire even
ing, and was interrupted in the story only
three or four times. She spoke so low that
it was only with the greatest difficulty that
she could be heard, even by the shorthand
reporter.
She began by saying that her name was
Martha E. Overman. She became ac
quainted with Mr. and Mrs. Charles O.
Brown in Taconni five years aeo. At that
time Dr. Brewn was engaged in the min
istry there. She had heard Dr. Brown
preach, and she had been introduced to
him and his wife. That was several
months |>rior to their coming to San Fran
cisco. Ihe witness first came to San Fran
cisco in 1894.
Her acquaintance with Mrs. Tunnell be
gan in Tacoina and was renewed in this
City, and they were on friendly terms al
ways. The witness took up her residence
with the Browns a3 their guest by invita
tion of Mrs. Brown. She left there about
December 10.
Then she told about her acquaintance
with Mrs. Thurston. At the time she be
came acquainted with that lady Miss Over
man was living with Mrs. Tunnell.
Miss Overman then took up the salient
points of Mrs. Thurston's testimony and
denied many of her statements, at the
same time modifying others. She had
told Mrs. Thurston that Dr. and Mrs.
Brown had offered herahome. Shedenied
having said that she had had a good time
at Dr. Brown's.
"Did you say anythin g about Dr. Brown
being a very attractive gentleman?" asked
the judge advocate.
"I can't recollect the exact words. It
didn't amount to very much," was the
reply .
"Did yon make this remark to Mrs.
Thurston on her warning you to be care
ful, 'Oh, how smart you must be to guess
my secret?' " was asked.
"I never use the word 'smart,' " re
sponded Miss Overman, "and as to my
secret I was not aware that I had any se
cret."
The witness then proceeded to tell how,
at her request. Dr. Brown had consented
that she should assist him in his study and
act as his amanuensis occasionally.
"1 was very fond of books," she added,
"and I asked him if I might assist|him. I
had nothing to do but to read. I thought
of and admired Dr. Brown as a minister,
and 1 admired him too much. I looked
upon him as a hero. I suppose something
in my manner made Mrs. Thurston guess
it, and when sue made that remark I
passed it off very lightly, but I don't re
momber what 1 said."
The witness then told how Mrs. Thurs
ton had advised her that it would be im
proper to go to Tacoma with Dr. Brown,
as she had intended to go, because Dr.
Brown had arranged to have her go on a
half-fare ticket. She assured Mrs. Thurs
ton that she knew how to behave herself
like a lady, and that she considered her
self safe in Dr. Brown's company. She
promised Mrs. Thurston that she would
not go to Tacomu with Dr. Brown, but
Mrs. Brown insisted that she should go,
and she did so.
The witness detailed at great length her
meeMng with Mrs. Tunnell and Mrs.
Davidson and how much she appreciated
their protestations of friendship. Then j
she came down to Mrs. Thurston's testi- !
roony again and related how that lady had
asked her whether the doctor had ever
hucged her or squeezed her hand.
"I told her," continued Miss Overman,
"that he never aid, but I wished He
would."
This remark caused a smile to circulate
through the room.
The witness went on to tell how Dr.
Brown wrote her a letter detailing the in
cidents of his trio on the return to San
Francisco and how she wrote him shortly
afterwards. In that letter she let him
know that she admired him very much.
He replied with another letter in which he
said that be had always had a high regard
for her and had taken a deep interest in
her, but informed her that if she fancied \
that there was on his part any deeper feel
ing she was mistaken.
Ihis letter, Miss Overman added, hurt
her feelings, and she threw ft in the tire.
While in thiÃ mood sue received a letter
from Mrs. Davidson } inviting her to go to
San Francisco and live with her. She was
an old woman, she said, and would treat
her as a daughter.
\\ hen Miss Overman arrived, she went !
direct to Mrs. Davidson's place, and was j
most affectionately received. Mrs. David
son discussed the church gossip, the
Simpson trouble and the Herron trouble,
and told her also that Mrs. Dr. Brown had
spoken slightingly of Matlie, to the effect
that she had taken Mattie to her home as
an object of charity. It was because Miss
Overman believed that statement that she
refused to call upon Mrs. Brown.
Then the witness related how Mrs.
Davidson had broached to her the proposi- j
tion to blackmail Dr. Brown. She called j
Miss Overman's attention to the fact that ;
she was poor and assured her that the
solid trustees of the church would 3tand
benind Dr. Brown with money rather than
have another scandal following so closely
upon the heels of the Simpson trouble, the j
Herron affair and the Turkish tea party.
Miss Overman narrated how she had
told Mrs. Davidson that when Mrs. Stock
ton had called with a lawyer on Dr. Brown '
one night and insisted that the doctor j
should give her a letter of recommenda
tion to another church Dr. Brown flatly
refused.
"Mis. Davidson appealed to the fact that
I was a poor girl and had to work for a
living, and assured me ihat if I left the
matter to her she would manage to get the j
money," resumed Miss Overman. "So 1
entered into this scheme to blackmail Dr.
Brown. There's no use in calling it by
any other name except the plain truth." "
Mrs. Davidson toid the witness how she
had written for the Boston papers and I
how she could write a highly sensational j
story with the proper embellishments. â 
The sum agreed upon by the witness and
Mrs. Davidson was $5000 â $2000 in ca-h
and $500 quarterly, the note to be signed
by Dr. Brown and two or three of Ms most
trustworthy trustees and placed in a bank '
with 4 percent interest.
Mrs. Davidson informed her that Miss i
Simpson, with whom Dr. Brown had had
some trouble, had a brother who was City
editor of the Chronicle, "and, of course,"
she added, "the Simpsons haven't any love
for Dr. Brown."
She then proposed to Miss Overman that
the; should offer the sensaiional story to
the Chronicle- and get a good price for it.
Because of Mrs. Davidson's age and <rray
hairs, which might lead to her identifica
tion, sha did not want to go to the Chroni
cle herself and Miss Overman consented to
do so.
She called upon City Editor Simpson, to
whom she was a stranger, and informed
him that she had a sensational story im- i
plicating a prominent citizen and" she
wanted to know whether he wished to
bay "it. The editor inquired as to the pur
port of the story and Miss Overman told
him that she would call again.
As she left the onice she observed that a
man had been put on her track, who fol
lowed her to her house. In order to throw i
him off the scent she left the house again, \
turned around the Market-street side of
tbe Baldwin Hotel, stopped in front of a j
show-window until the spy came around j
the corner and saw that she had perceived i
his purpose. She then went on a car and
rode up Market street, having thrown the
young man off the trail.
She next narrated how in pursuance of
the plot she had cone to Mrs. Tunnell's
room durinir Mr?. Tunnell's absence and
abstracted a bundle of letters which she !
had written to Mrs. Tunnell. TheÂ«e she
took tor Mrs. Davidson, and at Mrs. Da
vidson's suggestion she rewrote the letters,
putting matter^ in them to show that Dr.
Brown was a guilty man. After this was
done she surreptitiously returned the let- {
ters to Mrs. Tunnell's room.
Miss Overman proceeded with her story j
from this point to the effect that after the !
plot had been matured she realized what a
wicked thing it was and the danger of the j
matter becoming public, and repented of
what she had done. She thereupon in
formed Mrs. Davidson of her intention of
withdrawing from the plot and foroade
her to take any steps in that direction.
Mrs. Davidson, finding that Miss Over
man was unshakable in her resolution,
pretended to repent also and did not men
tion the subject any more.
Miss Overman next detailed how she
had tried to get the Tunnell letters back
again for the purpose of destroying them,
and how she had failed to find them.
These were the letters which were after
ward published in the dail} T papers and
which contained many incriminating re
ferences to Dr. Brown.
At this stage of the proceeding the coun
cil adjourned until 2 o'clock this afternoon.
THE STATE COMMITTEE.
It Will Meet To-Morrow to Arrange
for the State Con
vention.
To-day a large number of the members
of the Republican State Central Commit
tee will arrive in the City, and at the
meeting of the committee in Pioneer Hah
to-morrow afternoon the campaign will be
practically opened by the fixing of the
time and place for holding the State con
vention and the ordering of primary elec
tions for the selection of delegates to it.
The executive committee wilt probably
meet again to-day, and the call for the
State convention and the plan for the
holding of primaries, which have been
prepared for submission to the State Com
mittee, may be again considered and
amended. A majority of the executive
committee has lavored using the Estee
vote instead of the Harrison Presidential
vote as the basis for the apportionment of
delegates to the State convention, but this
will be one of the matters to be decided by
the convention.
On the basis of the Estee vote the total
number of delegates would be over two
hundred less than at the convention of
two years ago, according to the appor
tionment of one delegate to every 200
Estee votes, which the executive commit
tee has decided to recommend. The rep
resentation from San Francisco would also
be considerably less on the basis of the
Estee vote than it would be on the basis of
the Harrison vote. The call adopted by
the executive committee provides for
primaries to be held April 90, and fixes
May 12 as the time for the State conven
tion.
It cannot be prophesied what city will
win the convention. Sacramento has so
far put forward the most vigorous efforts
to get it. and a committee from the Sacra
mento Board of Trade will be on hand to
morrow to help urge the claims of that
city for the convention. San Jose, Stock
ton and Santa Cruz also have aspirations
for the convention, and will undoubtedly
rind friends talking for them to-morrow.
During the past few days many Repub
licans in San Francisco have spoken of the
possibility of the convention being
brought here. The last Republican State
Convention to be held In this City was
that of 1888.
As the convention of this year will
simply nominate Presidenual electors and
Congressmen, the interest is not as keen
as when State officers are to be nom
inated, but a large attendance is expected
at the meeting to-morrow.
RALLY FOR TEMPERANCE
The League of the Cross Holds
a Very Successful
Meeting.
FATHER YORKE ON ABSTINENCE
Prize Essay on Total AbstinenceâRe
ply to Calumnies on the
. Subject.
Saratoga Hall, on Geary street, was
densely crowded last night at the rally of
the Cathedral Branch of the League of the
Cross. A large proportion of the audience
consisted of boys who are members of the
Catholic Temperance Society.
James Gildea presided, and in a brief
opening address stated the purposes and j
ambitions of the league. He announced
that a prize-essay contest would be held ,
among members of the Cathedral Branch, ;
and appointed A. H. Loughborough, !
Brother Erminold and Thomas G. Spil
lane as judges of the essays:
The programme was as follows:
Song, "Hearest Thou" (Mattei), Miss Mary 1
Spillaiic; essay, Captain Deasy; recitation,
"Star-spangled Banner," Miss Gonzalez; essay, j
Corporal Benjamin L. McKiuley; duet, i
clarionet, "Hear Me, Norma," August and j
Miles Geiss; essay, Kd ward Byrnes; singing of \
"America," audience; essay, William Hughes; i
"Anchored," K. J. Sandy; cornet solo. I. C. !
Coggin.
The subject of all the essays was, "Why
lam a total abstainer." The judges an- j
nounced that they had found the essays !
equal for literary merit and -argument, but
that the attractive oratory oi' McKinley
gave him the prize.
Rev. P. 0. YorKe delivered a timely ad- j
dres3. When his name was announced it
was greeted with extraordinary clamor, j
that grew in volume with age. After ihe j
applause had subsided Father Yorke ad- ;
vanced to the front of the stage, and then â¢
again applause burst from the audience, i
"I feel Jike asking, in the words- of a j
famous politician," he said, " 'Where am I j
at?' I learned this morning I had taken i
to the woods. If wo are in the woods now, !
all I can say is, the woods are full of us.
"I am glad to see such a splendid audi- :
dience at this rally of the League of the I
Cross of St. Mary's Cathedral. The league 'â¢
was begun hy that great and good man.
Bishop Montgomery, in a basement. I
only wish he was here to-night to see how
the little band that met in the basement
has grown, till now this hall is too small j
for the crowd which haa come here to i
know about the league.
"The essays you have heard here to- '
night and this meeting tell you better than ;
1 can what are the objects of this organi- I
zation. it teaches you we are not leading |
these boys into paths whereot they know I
not the reason, but to stand up like young !
Americans who are not afraid of any |
| man, or to say what they think. We need
manly men. The State has need of men
of principle. The time has come when
j truth, honor, justice and loyalty should
j be the only passports to social, political
: and business distinction.
"I say we are doing more for this com- j
I munity than any other body is doing. We \
I hear certain people boast about their patri
otism, to#t they are defenders of the Xa-
I tion. They may say they are defenders
\ and wind the flag around them to hide
their soresâ patriot defenders â for cash.
| We arc not passing a basket around the
| hall to-night for nickels ; we are not prat
ing for a better parisn. This is not for
money, nor personal ambition; but on a
night like this these young men gather in
a good cause wnich is near and dear to
their hearts."
Father Yorke explained that the rally
and medal contest were held to sustain in
terest and enthusiasm in the work of the
organization. The City had to be divided
into four districts, because the league had
grown so fast that no hall in San Fran
cisco was large enough to accommodate all
the members. Continuing, he said:
"Every preacher who comes along here
sayÃ San Francisco is the wickedest town
on earth. One gentleman I had to do with
said the hotter place was eleven inches
under the sidewalk. How he knew I
don't know. This much Ido know; there
is fur more intemperance here and it is far
harder to rai^e little ones in the fear and j
love of God than in any otner city of the
Union. The demon of drink stalks the
streets and there is no one to say him nay."
In San Francisco there are 3345 saloons,
while in New York there are 7000. Some
people declare it is due to the Irish, and to
the Pope's Irish at that. They say, 'You
can't be good citizens because you find the
names of Irish people abovt nearly all the
saloons.'
"I learned a lesson lately from looking
over the statements of other people, I
sent to the license officer in the City Hall,
and here is what I found: 1437 saloons
owned by men of the German race, 695 by
Irish, 531 by Americans and English, 280
by Spanish, Italians, etc., 11l by Swedes,
169 by French, 28 by Slavs, 04 by Scotch
and oO by Chinese.
"This same insult has been hurled in our
faces in almost every city in the Union,
and in every city it is a calumny. ' Yet we
hear it every day. Let me say "there is no
class of people in this country who are
doing so much in the cause of abstinence
as the Irish Catholics. It was an Irishman
who in the beginning of this century struck
the lirst blow for temperance â Father
Mathew. All through America are great
Catholic temperance organizations, and
the youngest is not the leastâ the League
,of the Cross. We are trying to do our part,
i and more than our part, to combat the
; evil of intemperance."
Fathers O'Ryan and Byrnes delivered
* short addresses to the boys on temperance
and the successful meeting dissolved.
SAM RAINEY MAY BOLT
Trouble in the Junta Develops
Preparations for an
Early Battle.
The Rainey â¢ Daggett Forces Are
Hustling Everywhere to Gain
More Strength.
A victory for Rainey in the new Junta
general committee, a bolt of the Rainey-
Daggett-Lanigan forces in the event of
defeat, and a com promise which may be
fixed up within a week to hoid the trem
bling organization together, are three
things talked about among the Junta
people now.
Nobody is sure in which of the three
directions things will ko within" a few
days, but the general feeling is that
Rainey will win what he wants to win.
The coalition of the Rainey, Daggett and
Lanigan forces against Chairman Sullivan
and (iavin McSab, who run things at
headquarters with the support of the anti-
Raitiey primary committee, is close to a
majority if it is not already one, and
effective workers from these camps are
hustling about the districts finding out
just how things stand and winning sup
port wherever possible.
Chairman Sullivan won't talk back to
George Maxwell, secretary of the Fire Com
mission, who save the bosses at the Junta
headquarters a broadside yesterday. Max
well sticks to his declaration of war and
his intention to let the twenty-five delegates
elected Monday night in the Forty-fourth
go before the new general committee and
demand to be seated regard less of the new
election in that district which Chairman
Sullivan Witt have. held Within a few days.
This is the main proposition upon which
a pitched battle is likely to ensue.
â¢'Ail -I wish to say is that I am glad the
crisis has come," said Chairman Sullivan
yesterday. "Maxwell's action and the
action of the primary committee in order
ing a new election will, I think, convince
everybody that we are sincere In our op
position to Rainey, Our refusal to let
Rauiey: increase his representation in the
general conmiittee from any district is
simply a matter of expediency, and we
will stick to it. But I don't believe in
personal controversies in the newspapers."
A new ticket for the Forty-fourth is
being fixed up at headquarters and it will
be the only one that will be recognized at
the new election. It is hinted that this
ticket Will shut the Maxwell faction out
entirely, and then the battle to see whether
or not Sullivan can dictate the delegates
fro-m the Forty-fourth will be on. The
Junta primary committee will likely meet
to-night to take some further action about
the various district rows.
MURDER AND SUICIDE.
Inquests on the Bodies of May Conboy
and John Dolnn.
Inquests on the bodies of John Dolan
and May Conboy, who were found dead in
a rea,r room of 108)^ Morton street, were
held by Coroner Hawkins yesterday morn
ing. It will be remembered that the
bodies were found lying on a bed in one
of the houses on Morton street.
George Dolan, a brother of the dead
man, testified that John met May Conboy
at Shell Mound Park four years ago and
became infatuated with her. The deceased
had several bandied dollars in bank, and
George asked him whether he had any of
it left; and deceased said he bad not, as he
hail squandered it all on May Conboy.
Witness wis told by his brother a few
weeks prior to the shootine that he would
rather see May dead than leading the life
she had cbo-en, and that he borrowed
from the witness the revolver with which
the killing was done.
G. Marion was next sworn and testified
that he had met May Conboy a few hours
prior to her death, and she told witness
that John Dolan was getting jealous, and
that she was afraid of him.
The jury returned a rerdict of auicide !n
Dolan's case, and that May Conboy came
to her death by a bullet-wound, inflicted
by John Dolan, now deceased.
The School Vacations.
At the last meeting of the Merchants' Ass
ociation President Dohrraann was authorized
to appoint two special committees. One was
to consist of five members who will act as
vice-presidents nt the mass-meeting of the
Highway Improvement Committee, L. A.
W., winch will be held in Odd Fellows' Hall
on the evening of March 3. Mr. Dohrmami
yesterday selected K. Melrose, A. S. Ualdwin,
M. S. Kohlberg, L. R. Ellert and VanderJynn
Stow. The other committee, consisting of three
members of the association, lia-s been ap
pointed to urge "upon the proper authorities to
change the time of ihe school vacation so thF.t
the public schools of this City will close from
about July 1 to the middle of August. Those
selected were R. L. Toplitz, Percy Beamish and
Andrew M. l)avis.
The Captain Hoaly Cane.
The evidence in the Captain Healy case is
now all in, and Judge Advocate Reynolds pre
sented the side of the prosecution yesterday.
The findings of the court-martial will now be
submitted to the authorities at Wa c hington for
approval. The charges against Daniels and
others will not be ttu-.en up at once.

The Eloquent A. P. A.
Champion Closes His
Argument.
THE COURT'S DECISION.
Major Sherman Declares the
Quotations Are From Cath
olic Works.
IMMENSE GATHERING.
Thousands Attend the Meeting and It
Passes Off With Two Slight
Disturbances.
Twice durinp the early part of the pro
ceedings last night in Metropolitan Temple
there were interruptions that might have
developed inio serious disturbances had it
Dot been for the prompt aid of the score
or more of police officers who were present.
Rer. Donald M. Rosa delivered his fourth
fttid rinal lecture on the propositions which
he attirmed were true in regard to the Ro
ni;in Catholic church and which Rev.
Peter C. Yorke denied. He then sunima
li^cd all the citations and evidence he had
submitted on tnu four nights, and Major
Edwin A. Sherman, the court commis
- elected on Monday night by the
â  idience, rendered his decision, declaring
that the speaker had thoroughly sustained
Si is position on each and all of the propo
sitions.
Major Edwin A. Sherman made his ap
nearnnce on the platform to deliver his
opening remarks to the crowded audience
prommly at the hour of 8. He had ut
tered but a few words with reference to
what he called -the attack made on him by
Father Yorke when he came to these
words:
"I oannot handle the weapons of Peter
C. Yorke."
This brought out a volume of cheers and
applause and an almost imperceptible
hissing. While the demonstration was
dying out, above it rose the shout of a gen
tleman near tiie entrance to the audito
rium.
"I am here to defend him," he cried.
"Take him out.'" "Put him out" and
volley? of hisses came from various parts
<'f the house, and about half the audience
rose to their feet to tet a look at the bold
individual. For a few seconds a panic, if
not a riot, seemed imminent. But the
offender was quietly led from the hall by
a police officer and the speaker continued :
Had he not attacked my military record, that
it m- clear as the 6unlight, I would simply have
ignored him.
He then reviewed that portion of his
life and added that he was now enjoying a
service pension from Uncle Sam for par
ticipation in the Mexican War, and that he
had refused to collect the pension granted
him when be was mustered out for dis
ability incurred on the field of battle. He
then went on:
As I said I do not use the weapon of Peter C.
Yorke. I do say this, however. He is the
ir.(j>t vicioai hog in the nasty stye of the
Roman Catholic church. [Wild applause]
And 1 will say turthtr that his tongue cannot
distill one drop of truth. We will now have a
little music. [Laughter.]
After Mrs. Jessie Brock Morgan had
rendered a vocal solo Major Lherman
again spoke. He said:
I did not seek this position. I took it be
cause I felt it to oe a dnty which I owed to
Gcd, to my country, myself and my brother
Mason, Dr. Ross, and carried out my fraternal
obligations to him. 1 stand with him to the
last, if fall we must, but we fear nothing. The
perpent is gnawing on a file, his teeth are
nearly worn oat, and in the end will bite him
self.
Chairman Hubbell then announced that
T. C. Ryan of Columbus, Ohio, was on
his way to the coast to deliver a
series of lectures under the auspices of
Council 17, A. P. A., beginning Sunday
night. He then asked the ushers to pass
the collection baskets, and a considerable
sum was realized, to be used in defraying
the expenses of the series of lectures which
concluded last night.
Key. Donald M. Ross, escorted by Major
Sherman, then came forward, and the lec
turer's appearance was greeted with ap
plause, which continued for some time.
Hardly had Mr. Ross reached his desk
when a gentleman in the gallery on the
rii!ht arose and shouted at him :
'Mister, can I ask one or two ques
tions?"
His interruption was met with a storm
of hisses from the audience. When this
die:l out he began again :
"I asked him to permit â "
lint he was headed off by Chairman
HubbelJ, who shouted to him to sit down,
and similar shouts came from the audi
ence. He finally sat down, and then came
applause and yells to put him out. Mean
while a hie of about a dozen officers had
reached the gallery, and the first one mo
tioned to the audience that all was serene.
Then fome one shouted: "Let him stay,
and convert him." Â±nd he was allowed
to remain. Mr. Koss raised his hand for
silence and then began:
Your Honor, Ladie* and Gentlemen: lam first
to meet you to-night, and I shall be pleased to
have q'ue6tions asked of me. But I
wish it distinctly understood right
now that no man has the right to
starui up and interrupt for a moment.
[\pplause.] If the gentleman had asked it in
a gentlemanly manner and in the English
language [applause] I would have asked you
to bear with him. Perhaps later on, if he will
ask it civilly and not as a right, I will be per
fectly willing to answer his questions to the
fullest [Applause.] 1 assure you, my friends,
I feel perfectly Milling and am well on my
feet I do not hnvÂ« wgo into the Monitor
oilice and take a pencil and a drink. My
windmill runs by water.
Now ladies and gentlemen, I have tried
from the first to the lastâ from 10 o'clock last
Thanksgiving day until to-nightâ to meet the
requirements of the challenge and to meet it,
i.- ] conceive, in the spirit of a gentleman and
a scholar. I did not resort, if I may so state,
to blackguarding; I did not resort to saying
that the statements of my opponent were lies
and forgeries, lam honorable and lam win
ing to concede thai another is honorable and,
when I selected my commissioner in this mat
ter I withdrew from the case. 1 sought to put
no obstruction in the way, but rather tore
move every obstruction in order to permit a
d 'l C am Crt perfectly willing to go down to defeat if
the truth reqnires it. And the commissioner
whom r haye selected knows it ll the absolute
truth what I say. 1 dealt with him on the
highest plane that I believe a man could deal
witfa-a court of justice or arbitration-and I
was willing to leave the decision in the hands
a certain thing that makes me
ci,,ubt to c. certain extent the good intention of
him who challenged me. If I am wrong I
iimli apologue.
The speaker then referred to his previous
Btatemtnts that he had always understood
that the matter was to be heard in public
and that Father Yorke had agreed to thai
condition. Continuing, he said:
I am not afraid o( defeat, any more than I
Â«ra afraid of a fight. 1 am more anxious for
truth than. l am for victory, for, alter all, a
victory that hats not the truth behind it is
worse than defeat. 1 believe, however, that 1
nave not been .leak with fairly or honorably
from the very first.
I regret it," for 1 would rather believe that
the organization of which he U a prominent
member would repudiate such action es has
been manifested in this matte?, i believe that
mv brothers, whether in the Protestant
entireties or in no cllurch at all, believe that I
have done as fairly and honorably as a man
could do.
He reviewed briefly what he had en
deavored to prove on the three preceding
nights, and continued:
â¢ To-night I shall take proposition No. 8, and
then, if the court pleases, I shall summarize
the salient points of the evidence submitted to
the court. I shall now submit the proofs on
the third proposition, which is as follows:
"The Roman church and her ecclesiastics
have a right to immunity from civil law."
After paying a tribute to the faithfulness
of the press reporters and the papers they
represented for what he termed their
arduous and careful wort, he said:
I suv that the Roman Catholic church
teaches and holds as a dogma that she, the
organization, and her priests, bishops, arch
bishops and cardinals, teaches and holds as a
doctrine thai they ought to have immunity
from civil law. Remember, I do not say that
the <"atholic church holds as a dogma that you,
a layman, ought to hnve immunity from civil
law, but that the priests and bishops and the
Pope ought to have immunity from civil law;
that they ought not to be amenable to civil
law at all.
I nm not fighting the Roman Catholic
church. 1 am not saying that the Roman
Catholic church is wrong in holding that, and
will go further and say that if I were to-night
a priest of the Catholic church I would not
deny it. as he does; and furthermore, from the
standpoint of a truthful and honorable Chris
tian man cfr woman ] believe there is no right
position to take but that. And 1 say that as a
Roman Catholic I would not and could not be
lieve otherwise from the standpoint of the
Roman Catholic church, and I am not even
saying thai the standpoint is wrong.
If the Catholic church is right, if it is the
kingdom of God on earth, don't you believe
if there be a God in heaven that he is greater
than any man or king or president, and don't.
you believe that his laws are above the laws
of man, and if the Catholic church be the
kingdom of God on earth then her ecclesiastic*,
being God's representatives, ought to be free
from being called before any court on the face
of the earth.
I am not saying that the Roman Catholic
church is wrong; 1 ani not saying that it is
right. lam simply going to-night to stick to
my text. Ail thai I have to do to-night is to
show to you out of Roman Catholic publica
tions tnat Rome dues believe and teach that
the priests ought not to be .amenable to the
civil laws.
Now, lam going to resort to citation. lam
going to summons witness â competent wit
nessesâout of the ecclesiastics, and they ought
to know. I have to-nignt brought the mass
ot books and works that 1 have cot to lead me
into the .light or into the woods, and- if any of
you doubt it, kindly, when I read the bonk'and
piij.'c, name n. man to come up here and read
it for himself aud see if I am right or not.
JApplause.] I now quote from volume 1, page
11, of the "Elements of Ecclesiastical Law";
"'ivil laws derive all their forces, so far as
they are apyilicaDle to ecclesiastical matters,
solely from the authority of the church."
Now. if the civil laws nave no force on mat
ters pertaining to the church except from the
authority of the church, il it not true that
these laws are, so far as the church is con
cerned, as though they had never been? If
the civil law has no force in matters pertain
ing to the church except from ihe authority of
the church, all matters there are not amena
ble to law> that have not its consent.
In volume 1, page 229, of the same work we
find:
"According to the declaration of the sacred
congress of January 23, ISSti, approved by
Pope I.co XII!, ecclesiastics and other's
must always obtain leave from tne Holy See
] before they can have recourse to the secular
I court against a Bishop, even though it be in
I temporal matters. "
My iriends, U you have to ask my consent
j betore you have me arrested, don't you think I
I am pretty free of the law?
Father Yorke cannot sue Archbishop Rior
dau. Ecclesiastics and others must always ob
tain leave from the Holy See before they can
have recourse to the secular court against a
Bishop.even though it be In temporal matters.
If he won't pay his beer bill he can't be sued.
On page 443, volume 4, oi this work there is
this:
"Church property is, both by ecclesiastical
and divine right, exempt from tne jurisdic-
I tion of the civil government. H-ence laws en
actedâc. g., by Legislatures in the United
States incapacitating church corporations from
acquiring more than a specified amount ot
propertyâ are null and void."
And you can pass an act in the Legislature
of ( alifornia so that Father Nugent shall not
hold more property than that bill calls for,
and he says: '-You go down below and I will
do just what I like. Your laws are null anii
void." Fortunately I have been trained in
the law so that I understand its construction.
In volume 1, page 92, occurs the following:
"Thus, according to the common law of the
church ecclesiastics are not amenable to the
jurisdiction of civil courts; the Bishop is the
only competent judge in all their causes."
Did I do wrong in accepting nis challenge,
even when the words were put in my mouth?
[Cries of "No!" "No!"] Volume 1, page 190,
provides thus:
"Criminal charges, charges against the Bish
ops in tho United States and missionary coun
tries in general, are adjudicated upon by the
propaganda."
When somebody will say that is all right
they can be aUjudlcated by the propaganda.
I would like my opponent to stand up, throw
away the question of forger and throw away
the question of lie, take the books and the
quotations from them, have them reproduced
in the press and then defeat me. But a man is
not defeated by being called a liar and a
forger. [Shout from some one in the audi
ence, "He is a dirty liar:"]
"The Life of Pope Pius IX," a Roman Catho
lic work which is here, contains these words:
The 205 Bishops, In their address to Pius
IX of June 8, 1862, at Rome, said:
'â¢We condemn the errors which you have
condemned; we denounce and condemn ihe
sacrileges, spoliations and violations of ec
clesiastical immunities and other outrages
which have been committed against the
church."
Well, then, does not the church claim im
munities, according to this? Here is another
from an authorized work in German and
Latin:
"Die immunitat der kirche und der kirch-
Uchen personeo hatte ihren Ursprung nicht
vom eivikrechte." "The immunities of the
church and of ecclesiastical persons have not
their origin in civil right.'"
Here is another lrom the "Elements of Eccle
siastical Law." I want you to know it is not
mine. But I tell you, my friends, I regret as
much as any Roman Catholic In San Francisco
that this is found in the ecclesiastical law:
"Q.â ls it allowed to transfer priests of bad
morals from one parish to another instead of
deposing them ?
"A.â lf the character of such a priest Is un
known in the new parish, and if there is a rea
sonable hope that by tiie change they will re
form, it is unquestionably lawful to transfer
them."
This concluded the consideration of the
third proposition and Mr. Ross began his
review of the. other three, taking up the
first proposition. In support of his con
tention he quoted as follows:
"Now, it is evident that the church insti
tuted by Christ is a society complete ana inde
pendent, because it has been lormed by Hod's
self, from whom it received its own authority;
and to this authority alone does it belong to
prescribe the means by which, in accordance
with the law given by Christ,, its end is to be
attained. No civil rower whatever has a right
to interfere with the legislation and govern
ment of the church, because on the one hand
the commission to teach was not conferred by
Christ on kings, princes or magistrates, but oil
the apostles and their successors. On the
other hand, the church being Catholic, her
power extends over the whole world, while the
jurisdiction of the state is conlined to the
limits of that state."
"We do not advocateâ far from itâ the
notion that the church must administer the
civil government. What we advocate is her
supremacy as teacher and guardian of the law
of Godâ as* the Supreme Court, which must be
recognized and submitted to as such by the
state and whose decisions cannot be disre
garded, whose prerogatives cannot be
abridged or usurped by any power on earth
without rebellion against the divine maiesty
and robbing man of his rights. As Christians
we must insist on this supremacy ; as Catholics
it is not only our duty but our glorious privi
lege to assent to it."
"I will draw out a proof that ultramontanism
and Catholicism are identical." But just pre
viously he said: "Tnis is ultramontfinism, the
essence of which is that the church, being a
divine institution and by divine assistance in
fallible, is, within its own sphere, independent
of all civil powers, and, as the guardian and
interpreter of the divine law, it is the proper
judge of men and nations in all things touch
ing that law in faith and morals."
The law of the church says:
"The church claims to be the sole (because
divinely appointed) judge of the sphere of its
own spiritual office, authority and jurisdic
tion. â¦ â¢ â¢ To concede or to abdicate this
mipreme spiritual office would be to the church
death. â¦ â¢ *
"At bottom, then, the question is simply a
question of the rights and prerogatives of the
spiritual order in the face of the temporal.
That order we have found to be by its own na
ture indepenaent and supreme. Every Chris
tian, every moralist, every man does and must
concede it, however by so doing he may reflect
on His own practice. If, then, that order be
presented on earth In its plenitude by the
Pope,, he must necessarily be independent and
supreme ia face of the representatives of the
temporal order; that is, in face of the secular
authority, the prince or the state."
I do not under.-tand how a man in the Ro
man Catholic church can deny these proposi
tions, and maintain his place In the church.
He is the heretic and not I.

sole fountain of that knowledge, has within its
sphere a sovereignty, and that sovereignty is
one which is exempt from all control of human
authority. No autharity on earth can Inter
vene to dictate to the church what it has to
teach or within what limits it shall teach.
* * * It is therefore not only exempt, but
supreme, and being supreme there can be no
appeal from it."
Supreme and without appeal I have shown
that it stands, or claims to stand, by this dec
laration, in temporal as well as spiritual
affairs. And in the face of what I have Quoted
Peter C. Yorke says he would obey the Gov
ernment of the United States where it came in
conflict with the mandates of the church. And
for that I nay he is convicted of being a heretic.
I. rather than he, am your friend.
The idea of a man claiming the dignity of
the priesthood falling so low as to say that the
only reason he has withdrawn from this wager
is that one of the judges is a foul-mouthed old
reprobate. It is he who is falling behind the
ditch of liar, forgery.
1 have presented my authorities, which are
incontrovertible. This shall disprove of this
proposition.
Now for the second proposition. Let me state
that priests have spoken here, night after
night, and no attempt was made to disturb
them. We do not have to resort to hoodlum
methods to maintain our position. We believe
the public school Is a civil matter and subject
to the jurisdiction of the authorities. Here is
something of what the Catholic church be
lieves on that subject :
"Experience teaches that the public or com
mon schools in the United States, owing to
their very system, the text-books used and the
class of children frequenting them, In most
cases endanger the faith and morals of Cath
olic children sent to them. If possible, the re
lore, a Catholic parochial school * * * should
be established in every congregation." [Laugh
ter.]
W e believe that the civil authorities have the
right to regulate marriage. There are certain
conditions where the state has the right to in
terfere: such us the existence of certain dis
eases. The Catholic church presents the fol
lowing as the chief impediments that render
marriage null. They are presented in the
shape of question and answer:
"Q â What are the chiet impediments which
render marriage null? A.â The chief impedi
ments which render marriage null are:
"-. Solemn vow of chastity.
"4. Difference of religion.
"!>. Clandestine performance of the mar
riage."
That is to say, in the one Instance, that a
ir.au who once takes the vows of the priest
hood can never marry, nor can a man or
woman who takes a solemn vow of chastity or
who is married outside the Catholic church or
whose marriage was clandestine.
The Monitor recently referred to the wed
ding of an e.\-priest, und used this language,
"Slattery's substitute for a wife." Think of
that! It is well for its editor that a sister of
mine is not married to one of those who have
taken this vow 01 celibacy in face of this ex
pression. There are some things I am not
afraid of, and under certain circumstances I
am not afrnid of hanging.
1 see by published telegram in this morn
ing's pa;jer a denial of the statement I made,
that' the Catholic church had recognized a
recent Canadian divorce. It will be remem
bered, however, that under their law the mar
riage was not legal, one of the parties being a
Protestant. 80 that there never was a mar
riage so far as that church was concerned. Ah,
they are all liars and forgers.
"Pope Pius IX himself in one of his dis
courses says, 'that the right of deposing
princes has nothing to do with the pontifical
infallibility, neither does it flow from the in
fallibility but from the authority of the Pontiff.'
Of course, a Catholic is bound not only to be
lieve what the Pope defines ex-cathedra, but
also to accept and obey what he otherwise
commands."
"On the rights of the supreme pontiffs in
temporal matters there are four different opin
ions, etc. First is untenable. Second is heret
ical. Third advanced, by Bellarmine and
others maintains that the Pot>e has jure divino
only spiritual, but no direct or immediate tem
poral power; that, however, by virtue of his
spiritual authority he is possessed of power in
direct indeed but nevertheless supreme in tem
poral concerns of Christian rulers and people
that he may therefore depose Christian sover
eigns should tne spiritual welfare of a nation
so demand. Thus a matter of fact Pope Inno
cent IV in pronouncing sentence of deposition
against Frederick II explicitly says that he de
poses the Emperor auctoritate apbstolicum et
vi clavium.
"Fourth opinion holds that the sovereign
pontiff has full spiritual authority over princes
no less than over the faithful; that therefore
he has the right to teach and instruct them in
their respective duties, to correct and inflict
spiritual punishment upon both rulers and
people, tmt that jure divino he has no power
as asserted by Bellarmine, whether direct or
indirect, in the temporal affairs of Catholic
sovereigns or peoples. * * â¢
"The third and fourth seem to differ chiefly
as to. the deposing power of the Popes, but
agree in granting that the Roman pontiff has
nn indirect power in temporal thing*; both
may be lawfully held.' 1
"All Catholics of all nations are bound to
defend the temporal rights of the church."
This sounds beautiful in the ears of Ameri
cans who love liberty.
"I mean to assert that the temporal rights of
the Holy See are mo>>t intimately connected
with our dearest ana our most sacred religious,
social and political rights."
"The Roman people, had they so desired,
had no right to transfer by their* suffrage the
patrimony oi St. Peter to Victor Emmanuel."
"The tribunal of the Inquisition is composed
of a supreme chief, who is called the grand in
quisitor, and is always either an Archbishop or
a Bishop, and of eight ecclesiastical counsel
ors', six of whom must be of the Dominican
order, by virtue of a privilege which was
granted by King Philip III."'
Now, then, let me tell you something else.
Now, it you were a heretic you would be
brought to a burning purgatory, or as the
church says :
"If tne accused be declared a heretic the tri
bunal, after having pronounced sentence of
confiscation, hands him over to the secular
power for legal punishment. If the proofs are
not irresistible, If the culprits are not obsti
nately attached to heretical doctrines, they are
merely required to abjure them."
If the priests found the person accused here
tical they took his possessions. They handed
him over to the secular authorities for execu
tion after he had been condemned. The church
has this to say of Galileo:
'â¢What is the reason of Galileo's imprison
ment? It was not for his scientific researches
or conclusions Galileo was imprisoned, but It
was because he was well known to be a man
hostile to the Catholic faith and that there
whs that concealed in the spirit of his writings
and In the man's conduct that alarmed the
church and alarmed the authorities of the
time in his regard. "
The amazing thing to me is how the laity of
the church can stomach all thig.
The celebrated Gregory VII sent messages to
almost all the sovereigns of Europe, telling
them to come off their perch and crown him
as their lord and ruler. To Philip of France
he said :
"Maximo Knitire ut Petrum in cujus Dotes
tate est regnum tuum, et in terra ligare et ab
solverc, tibl facias debitorum."'
In this Philip was told that his kingdom and
his soul were under the dominion of St. Peter
(i. c. the Pope) who had the power to bind and
to loose him, both in heaven and on earth.
To the King of Spain he said:
"Regnum Hispaniee antiguo Proprii justis 8-
Petri fuisse et soli apostolicae side ex aeguji
pertinere."
Ask Yorke to translate that and see if it does
not mean that the kingdom of Spain has been
from the earliest under the dominion of the
Holy See.
A few years ago a Catholic servant girl in a
Jewish family in Bologna took a child newly
born and baptized him secretly with
out telling his parents. The servant
girl committed a grievous sin, and fell
under the censure of the Catholic church,
but the Catholic church had to acknowledge
that tlie child was baptized. What followed
from this? It followed that the Catholic
church was obliged to ask the parents of the
child to bring him up a Christian because he
was baptized a Christian. The parents re
fused and Pius IX was the tem
poral sovereign, and these Jews were
his subjects, and also as head of
the Catholic church Pius IX was bound by the
doctrines of the church and l-y her discipline
to secure to that child a Christian education
until he was seven years old and Could decide
for himself whether he would be a Christian
or a Jew. The parents refused, and Pius IX
was obliged to place the child under the care
of a Christian teacher.
Because that child's parents were under th c
Pope's dominion, he took the child out and
educated him until he was 7 years old. What
kind of feeling did the Pope have for the Jew
ish family? What right had he to step into
that home and take possession of that child
unless tjy the right of thedogmaof the church ?
Plus IX says: "If the church should hesitate
or give way before an opposition of newspapers
and governments its office as witness and teach
er of revelation would be shaken through the
world."
Cardinal Manning says: "Italotiecan decide
iv questions where its power is in conflict
with the civil power."
Brownson's Review says: "Whenever the
civil power comes in conflict with the relig
ious Ihw the civil, not the religious, must give
way."
Cardinal Manning says:
"Tne Catholic church is the highest and final
judge of what is the faith and what is the law
of God, and when science ana politics come
into conflict with the faith and that law it
admits of no appeal from its own decision to
any tribunal out of itself, to any judge of
appeal in the past or in the future."
What more do you want me to prove? Ec
clet-iastical Law declares:
"The authority of the princes and the alle
giance of subjects in the civil state of nature
are of divine ordinance: and, therefore, so
lonjr as princes and their laws are in
conformity to the laws of God the
church has no jurisdiction against them
or over them. If princes and their laws de
viate from the law of God the church has au
thorlty from God to judge of that deviation
and oblige to its correction. When a Christian
world came into existence the civil society of
man became subject to the spiritual direction
of the church."
Tertullian, in his book, "Ad Lxorum," again
Â»ays, page 178: "Ide penes nos occultaae
quoque conjunctiones hoc est non pius abud
eccleciam, professte juxta mspchtam et forni
cationem judicari prielitautur!"
"There are among us unions which are not
made before the church, and they run the risk
of being called adultry and fornication.'
Tertuliian, in his book "Ad Uxorum," recom-
I mends "the faithful to receive the uuptial
benediction so as to remove all suspicion of
fornication and concubinage which rests upon
those who marry privately."
Is not this having dominion over temporal
affairs?
The fifteenth canon of the Council o f Clare
mont says: "Ne episcopus vel sacredos regi
velalicni laico in manibus ligiam fidelitatem
faciat."
It is enacted that no Bishop or priest shall
promise under oath liege obedience to any
king or any layman.
"Elements of Ecclesiastical Law" declares:
Iv whatever things, whether essentially or
by accident, the spiritual endâ and that is the
end of the church is necessarily involvedâ in
those things, though they be temporal, the
church may by right exert Its power and the
civil state ought to yield. The proposition is
proved (1), from reason (2). We next prove our
thesis from authority. We refer to the famous
bullJUnara Sanctum, Issued by Pope Boni
face VIII, in 1302. This bull declares there
i Is but one true church, and therefore but
one head of the churchâ the Roman Pontiff;
that there ere two swords, i. c., the
two power?, the spiritual and the tem
poral, the latter must be subject to the
former. The bull finally winds up with
this definition: "And this we declare, affirm,
define and pronounce that it is necessary for
the salvation of every human creature that he
[ should be subject to the Roman Pffnttff."
This is undoubtedly an utterance ex cathedra.
In fact the bull had for its object to
define dogmatically the relation of the
church to the state in general that is uni
versally. The Catholic interpretation of
I this bull is that the church, and, therefore,
I the lope, has iudirect authority over the
state; that, therefore, the state is subject
to the church in temporal things, so far as
they relate to internal salvation or involve
sin. Again.it says the spiritual power (i. c.,
the church) has to Instruct and judge the
earthly power if it be not good. It is, there
fore, defined that the church, and therefore
the lope, has indirect power over the state,
and that consequently the state in temporal
things that Involve sin is subject to the
church."
In a lecture delivered in St. Peter's Church,
Barclay street, New York, on Thursday even
ing, May 23, IST'J, by Father Burke, he saia:
"The Catholic church insists in the teeth of
the world, and in spite of the world's pride
and ignorance and bloated self-sufficiency the
Catholic church insists, as she has insisted
for 1872 years, in saying: 'I know
how to teach; you don't; you must
come to me; you cannot live with
out me. Don't imagine you can live
by yourselves, or you will fall back into the
slough of your own impurity and corrup
tion.'" This is tine language to say to the
state. He continues: "The worid does not
like to hear this. The Catholic church insists
that she alone understands what education
mean.Â»; the world dees not like to hear that.
But I came here to-:iight to prove it."'
Religious Instruction says: "By virtue of
this divine invitation the marriage of Chris
tians is a sacrament, and will over remain so.
Any matrimonial contract between Christians
not having the charncter of a sacrament would
not oe a real marriage, nor even a valid con
tract. The purely natural contract no longer
exists, except among infidelsâ that is to say,
the unbaptized.
"(1) Marriage consists essentially in a con
tract formed between two persons, and is
called the contract of marriage; (2) what is
commonly called civil marriage differs essen
tially from the ecclesiastical marriage, which
alone is real marriage, the former having
nothing but a name.
"Civil marriage is a simple legal formality
by virtue of which the affianced are con
sidered as man and wife in the eyes of
the law, and they enjoy the rights which
the law accords to married persons and
their legitimate children. This purely
nominal marriage in no wav constitutes the
affianced man and wife before God, and if
they did not also contract the ecclesiastical
marriage their living together would be a sin."
1 thank God I am through with this debate.
I am not through with the purposes that
brought it about. [Applause.] This question
is before you through the kindness and
courtesy of the pre^s. But it will go wider yet.
I will publish it in book form that the world
will know it. [Applause]
Major Sherman explained that the court had
examined ali the Catholic authorities rela
tive to the four propositions as quoted
by Donald M. Ross, Bnd found that tne lat
ter had proved everything. He declared that
the arming of any t.tct was dangerous to the
welfare of the state, and he thought it the
right of every American citizen to arm himself
for self-protection.
The meeting then adjourned.

BIG GOVERNMENT SUITS
Fraud Charged in the Surveys
of the Visitacion
Rancho.
TWO OTHER SUITS TO FOLLOW.
Thousands of Acres and Millions of
Dollars Involved in the Liti
gation.
The office of the United States District
Attorney is at present prolific of sensa
tional lana suits.
Two suits, involving millions of dollars'
worth of property, are to' follow that of
the United States vs. the Abbey Land and
Improvement Company et al. between
now and March 3.
On the 21st inst. the United States Dis
trict Attorney filed a suit in ejectment on
behalf of the United States Government,
as trustee, against the Abbey Land and
Improvement Company and 114 other de
fendants occupying lands in the Visitation
Rancho. The lands included within the
boundaries of this rancho are Dartly in
San Francisco and partly in San Mateo
County.
The complaint charges fraud. An ex-
United States District Attorney of the
name of Sharp is accused of conniving
with the surveyors, who incorporated
within the boundaries of Visitation
Rancho a large tract of land that belonged
to the Gove rnment.
This suit is the result of charges made
by two men, named Clam and Murphy.
They claim they bought land from the
Government and t>aid for it on receiving
their patent. After receiving their title it
is alleged that the boundary lines of the
Visitation Kancho, a Mexican grant, was
surveyed by United States surveyors, and
they extended the lines of the rancho to
take in several hundred acres of land be
longing to this Government. In those
lands thus usurped for the rancho Messrs.
ClarJt aud Murphy as sert their acres are to
be found.
They could not bring suit in their own
names, and their only redress was to in
voke the action of the Government. The
initial suit involves many fine points of
law, and between now and Monday night
millions of dollars' worth of property will
be at issue.
The complaint filed by United States
District Attorney H. S. Foote does not
mince its allegations of fraud. In fact, it
is specified that without the connivance of
the United States District Attorney, then
Mr. Sharp, the surveyors of the Govern
ment could not have perpetrated the
fraud, and if the suit is won by the Gov
ernment there will be upwaid of 114 prop
erty-owners here and in San Mateo County
who will suffer. Ex-Mayor Plilert and
John T. Doyle, the attorney, are at the
head of the defendant Abbey Land and
Improvement Company.
The other two suits, which are to be filed
before March 3, are aeainat landholders in
the Los Pulgas and CorUe de Madro
ranchos. The former includes the city of
Redwood, San Mateo County, and the es
tates of many well-known millionaires,
among them Phelps, Hopkins, Robinson,
Britton, Flood and others.
The Corde de Madro Rancho grant and
survey covers the hamlet of Belvedere,
Marin County, and many private estates.
Fraud and inrccurate surveys will be al
leged In both cases, the same as in that of
the United States vs. the Visitacion
Rancho (Abbey Land and Improvement
Company et al.), and extended legal inves
tigations must follow.
In speaking of the suits last night, Dis
trict Attorney Foote said:
The two suits agaiust the Los Pulgos and
Cordo de Madro rauchos must be brought be
fore the 3d of March in order to get in
ahead of the law of limitation. Five years ago
Congress passed a bill limiting the time in
which to reopen the Spanish land grants. The
five years expires on the 3d of next month.
In these two cases kuils are brought to pro
tect the Government against the time limit,
and future action will depend on my investi
gations and report to Washington. Of course,
these people interested must understand that
I am acting only under instructions from
the United States Attorney-^eneral. i men
tion tnis because there are so many persons
who actually believe that I am the sole author
of such suits as these.
The property included in the Los Pulgos
Raucho suit involves extensive interests of
the Spring Valley "Water Company. It
may be expected that developments of
more than usual interest and importance
will follow.
Planting Kuzorbark Claras.
The Fish Commissioners yesterday received
7000 "razorback" clams from San Pedro, which
were sent here for propagation. Several weeks
ago the fishermen of San Pedro asked for a lot
of the large red crabs which are so plentiful in
the waters of the northern coast, but which
are not found in southern waters. In ex
change they offered to send a large ouantity of
the. razorbaok clams. When the clams arrived
Commissioner Emeric and Deputy Babcock
went out with these clams and planted them
in all the large mudflats around the bay.
To Lease the Woe Property.
The Probate Court has been petitioned to al
low the executors of the estate of John S. Doe
to lease for ten years the property on Market
street, near Jones. The- would-be lessees are
the present occupants, Raphael Peixotto and
Morltz Sllverman, doing business under the
name of Peixotto & Silvernian. The terms of
the lease, as agreed upon, are $24, 000 for the
Brat year and an addition 01 i lf 1200 for each
year after the first one.
' ' ' ' â Â» â¦ Â»
Flre Commissioners.
The Fire Commissioners met yesterday aftpr-
noon and appointed Edward Church hoseman
of engine 33. A. J. Himmelman, driver of en
gine 21, was fined live days' pay; Frank Len
nan, driver of engine 27, five days' pay, and
John McGerry, driver of chemical engine 0,
ten days' pay for carelessness with their ap
paratus.
The I. os Amgeles Forger.
Captain Lees received a dispatch yesterdny
fjom Chief Glass oi Los Angeles that an officer
had left to take bai-k E. J. Dole, the attorney
who was arrested here on Wednesday night for
forgery. The only information the police here
have is that Dole raised a draft from $250 to
$850.

LAWS FAVORING THE CHURCH
The Catholic Clergyman Answers the
Champion of the A. P. A. on the
Third Proposition. . .
The following is Father Yorke's answer
to Donald M. Boss' addross at Metropoli
tan Temple last .evening: _.. :'. '
To ike Editor of the CaUâT)EAR Sir: So the
farce has come to- ah inglorious end.- D. Ross
can gauge the height and depth. the Jco.n
terapt with which the public regard him. He.
can also estimate how much his "friends! 1 love
him. â¢ . â¢ ; /
As long as the munificent .sum of two bits
stood between them fend the Round of his siren
voice these patriots .. remained . religiously ;
away. But at the cry of & free' show the irar
rets'and the cellars â  gave np their, "hobo?,"
and the saloons along the water front mourned
their unwonted desolation. â â  â 
As usuAl the performance â  was- opened by'
Sherman. Last night 1 declared that Sher
man's name could not be found in the official
records of the Mexican War. He. re
plies by saying that he drew a pen
sion. Those who remember how camp-follow
ers, coffee-coolers, sutlers and. scaramouches
drew pensions are not surprised- at Sherman's
confession, that besides being a barriacle on
half a dozen secret societies, he is also a barna
cle on I'ncle Bam. " .'â¢.-' â¢:
Let me repeat now my: conviction that Sher
man is as much a major as I am a general. He
knows nothing about the Mexican War.' For
instance, he .stated tnat were .hardly 'any de
serters from the' volunteers In .that .war, yet the â¢
facts are that. out of the -6785' men who de- .
serted 3876 were from these, same volunteers.
Before Sherman pretends to sit in Judgment â¢
on any case let him first prove that he is not a
fraud.' I hereby demand evidence that he is.
entitled to the rank of major. I. demand evi
dence that he was ever enlisted for the Mexi
can service at all.
ft,*- THE CATHODE BAY. â¢ â  '
Sherman then began to grow' witty. He be
lieved that if he had a catnod* ray he could
see my in'ards full of snakes. lam sure that
he is able to conjure up the reptiles- without
having reco::-- 10 any thins so unsubstantial ',
es the cathode ray. Mr. ' -Editor, I
nave no doubt thr.t the X rays which would
flow from Sherman would possess a high poten
tiality. Experiments show that the greater
tne vacuum in the bulb the more powerful are
the rays. Sherman's cranium' is perhaps as'
complete a vacuum as science could desire:
P. Ro's proceeded to eulogire the ."judge"
â¢vrtioni he had selected. .He was an honorable
â sr.an. In fact, both are honorable men.
Sbtrman, who declared that -he 'would not i
believe a ;>rie.Â«t on oath, Is well fitted by grace I
end nÃture to act as judge in a case in which a
priest is concerned. Boss, whose only desire .
:s truth not nickels, was' so limited in his
search for a non-Catholic lawyer that he could.
only select ir.an who' would not believe a. '
jiriest on oath.. Is Sherman a- lawyer ? My pri
vate opinion is thai-he is as much a lawyers'*
)ie is a rnejor. 'No wonder Ross was willing. to i
leHve the decision to Sherman. Why did he !
.not put'lifh the decision himself ? \ ..!
" ' ' THE INEVITABLE PLATE.' â¢ ... ' !
The Tr.ost ludicrous portion of the' perform- !
ante va? the appearance of the inevitable '
j.laie. While the tariff of two bits, existed the j
patriots remained away. â¢ As I mentioned, at j
the cry of a tree show they online from all over
the City. Then the disinterested â  patriots
who are, to use Mr. Footers . words, "run
ning the show," could not resist the tempta
tion. A last attempt would be made to raise i
the wind, and so Hu Obeli produced the plate â¢
and demanded the nickels ol the.audience. I j
r*-pret to -<-â  that the patriots.proved obdurate. '
Only the Muses can describe the result, and j
my friend, the office-boy, iÂ» on intimate terms !
with the Muses. â¢ â  ' â  .-â¢ . J

The pretty little interruptions which oc
curred during the perform* nee were carefully
planned for effect. â¢ Alack and alas that they
fell so flat. Dr. Ross should be very careful
not to allude to the English language. â¢ ' "
He claims to have taken high honors in
mathematics, but if we are to judge of his at
tainments in that branch of learning by his
attainments in English grammar he does not
know the difference between the calculus aÂ«d
a milch cow. ... .
His attempt this evening was to prove his
third proposition, namely: â  â¢
"The Roman church and her ecclesiastics
have a right to immunity from civil law."
This proposition means that' the priests are
not bound by the civil law. Case tried to
prove this by doctoring Gury and changing a
yes into a no. Ross took a shorter way and
boldly put the proposition into the mouth of
the Pope. :
Here let me remark that Robs tries again to
crawl out of the responsibility for these propo
sitions. If he did not utter them how did they
appear in the Chronicle report of his speech,
why were they printed in the American
Patriot?
In an interview published in the Examiner
of November 29 Ross acknowledged that the
Chronicle "summary was fair to him." â He
cannot escape now by denying thai he never
used the propositions. .pSSffi
As usual Ross made no attempt to produce
the Roman Catholic publication from which
he had pretended to read. True, he brought
a basketful of books on the stage, but
the white marks on their . backs gave
away the sad secret that they were borrowed
from the Public Library. I suppose he spent
the Â£000 he speaks about in paying fines for
.retaining the volumes beyond the legal time.
The history of this proposition is similar to
that of the other three.
The thirtieth proposition of the 1 syllabus
runs as follows in Latin and in English: â 
XXX. Kcclesiaeetper-j XXX. The Immunity
sonartirn ecclesiastic:!- of the church and of ec
â¢ rum itnmnaitm a, jurejcleslastical persons had
civili ortuni habiut. | Its origin in the civil law.
You will see at once, Mr. Editor, that this
proposition deals, with a question of history.
V hat was the origin of those privileges known
as clerical immunities? . â¢ : .
An immunity means in law the exemption
of ecclesiastical persons and things from cer
tain burdens of state. The non-taxation of
church property is an immunity, the privilege
S by which ministers of the gospel are excused
from jury duty La an immunity. The half-fare
tickets or free passes given 'on railroads or
streetcars arc an immunity. . :'Â
, .Vow. in olden times these immunities wore
far more extensive than they are now After
' the conversion of . Constantine, as Newman
.'says: "Laws were pawed in favor .of the
-.church; Bishops could only be judged by
, -Bishops, and the causes of their. "clergy, were
withdrawn from the secular courts. '
TWir sentence was final.as if it were the
Emperor's own, and the Governors of provinces
were bound t.o-put it into 1 execution. Liti
gants everywhere, were allowed the liberty of
referring their cause to the tribunal of the
lfiÂ«-hoj>s, who, beside*, became arbitrators on a
large scale In private qurarels;an.d-the public.
even heathens, wished it 'so." '.'â '. .â¢'"*.
. During the Middle Age's these privileges con
tinued and were sometimes.. diminished some
times increased. * They formed a' large and
complex .set of rights rinnnjig from the simple"
and natural exemption from . military service
to the privilege of coining money arid exercis
ing many of Hie rights of a feudal sovereign.
When, therefore, we face this vast and com
plicated question and inquire what wa.s the
Â« origin of the, clerical immunities, we cannot
; solve it in v single sentence. Some of" these
Immunities no doubt had their origin in civil
"conditions, others arose from the very nature
of the clerical state. Hence, when the sweep
ing assertion "was made t:mt the immunities of
the church of ecclesiastical persons had their
origin in civil law, that assertion was con
demned by the Pope.
H7-T<il:V OK THE PROPOSITION.
The rr-a'l meaning ot the condemnation may
be seen more clearly when we remember the
historvof the proposition. As I mentioned a
few days ago the Pore in 1804 published a
syllabus or Index of errors which he had con
demned at -various tunes during his pontifi
cate.
In IS4S a South American clergyman had
written a book on the power of civil govern
me -. In that book he stated that these cler
ical immunities which had been sanctioned by
: r!n* laws of God and the canons oJ the church
had (heir origin in the civil law and that as
â fnr ns sacred ness was concerned the house of a
foreign Erabassador was far more sacred than
a church.
Of course, this crazy book was condemned,
and the proposition known as Xo. 'JO was ex
tracted from it.
American common-sense itself rejects such a
wild statement. Let us take a few of the im
munities which are in vogue among ourselves.
Do the railroads give clergymen special rates
because of the civil Inn?
Clergymen arc given special rates because
the corporations believe thai the calling of
ministers is a religious and charitable calling,
and because these special rates are in the na
ture ol a contribution to works of philan
thropy. This' immunity, therefore, has its
origin not in the civil law or in civil customs,
but in the very clerical character as established
by <iod.
Again, take an immunity which is set forth
law. Clergymen in this City are not sum
moned to do jury duty. The law makes the
exception, but why? What is the origin of the
Jaw? The origin of the immunity is again to
be found in the nature of the Christian minis
try, as established by Christ, just as the origin
of a similar immunity for physicians is rooted
in the Tight 8 and nature of the profession itself.
It is evident, therefore, that the proposition
cannot stand the test of common-sense, and
that it is as erroneous when judged by our
American standard as when judged by the
standard of the Pope.
I). Ross took this proposition of the syllabus
and treated it as he did the others. Again Jet
me use the "deadly parallel":
OKIOIN'AU ROSS' FORGERY.
â¢ â¢ * The Immunity â¢ The Koman church
of the church and Of ec- and her ecclesiastics
clfsiasticul parsons had have a right to immunity
its origin in the civil law. from civil law.
You can see at once how the proposition of
D. Ross misrepresents the position of the
church. It insinuates that the church and the
clergy are not bound by the civil law, and that
if we wish we can ride roughshod over the law.
Win dealing With Dr. Case I showed how
false this accusation was, and I repeat now
that we consider ourselves bound by eveay civil
law which is in accordance with the constitu
tion of this State and of the United States.
. An Immunity does not mean that we are not
bound by the civil law. It means an exemp
tion from certain public burthens. The doc
tor.who is exempt from jurr duty is bound by
the civil law just as much as the talesman who
is forced into the box.
The. churches which in various States are
exempted from taxation are just as much sub
ject to civil law as the corporations which pay
a percentage of their earnings into the public
treasury. When, therefore, the clerical im
munities are made to mean that the clergy are
not bound by the civil law, the object of the
interpretation is simply to calumniate the
church. â¢".';
Moreover, let me add that, the exemptions,
from public burthens have nearly all been
voluntarily surrendered, even in Catholic
countries, in modern times. The concordats,
or treaties, which the Pope makes with
such countries contain no provisions for
the old exemptions. Without a word
of prow si the privilege of separate courts has
been, relinquished, and the. clergy, even in
countries wholly Catholic, have been placed on
â the same footing of equality before the law as
other citizens.
These immunities of former days have served
their purpose. They were a necessary feature
in the evolution of civil society. Their useful
ness has passed, and without an expression of
regret the church sees them pass away.
The quotations which Ross produced are as
usual irrelevant and mangled. He quotes two
sentences from Cardinal Gibbons and leaves
out the words which explain what the Cardi
nal meant; but I hope to return to this again
and show that the noble act of Wendtelzing
Catholic authorities is not confined to the
other side of the bay..
As to the judgment pronounced by that old
humbug Sherman it was a fitting conclusion
to the farce. Without taking the trouble to
verify the quotations, without taking ten min
utes for' reflection, he stood up and delivered
his findings."
But what can we expect from a man who
would not believe a priest upon oathâ what
can we expect from a patriotic parasite and a
military fraud?
D. Ross is to be pitied. The gold mine, like
other gold mines, did not pan out. His feel
ings have. been so well expressed by my friend
the office boy that I conclude with the follow
ing description of the closing scene, in Tenny
sonian meter:
O Hubbell!. let me be a little while as yet my soul
: is filled. . . '
Filled .with bitter disappointment thus to see my
. meetings killed;
Meetings which I held in spite of Pope's Â»nd
priest's and bishop's curse.
Meetings which I hoped would fill up mine ema
ciated purse. *â¢t * â¢. â >
T/Ook around. you o'er the meeting, oh, the empty,
empty seats!
See th<- sorry set of coons and Scandinavian dead
.' beats.
Few the tickets that we sold them, spite of all
the son we sang:
Ne'er a nickel, Hubbell darling, ne'er a nickel's in
the gang:
Not a Koman came to hear me, 'tis the same old
Orange crowd:
Finns,. Kanucks, and Banes and niggers, and the
Swedish beetle-browed.
"Oh, that we could spoil the Papists, thÂ«y alone
have cot the tin;"
Donald sighed and eased his jawbone, rtubbell
wept and said "Amln."
â¢ Yours truly, P. C. Yorkk.
WEALTH Or THE ASTOES.
They Are Constantly Adding to Their
Realty Holdings in >*ew York.
The Astors are adding to their realty
holdings. To-day "William Waldorf Astor
purchased an old etiurch building on
! Forty-sixth street, between Sixth and
Seventh avenues, which covers three city
lots. By this purchase the great estate
gobbles the entire block, with the excep
'. tion of one lot. As this block is one of
! the several selected for the metropolitan
terminal of the big Nonh Piver bridge,
I which will surely be completed within
six or seven years, the reasons for the pur
: chase are obvious. The Astorsâ William
Waldorf and John Jacobâ are undoubtedly
! the largest individual owners of real estate
lin Gotham. Like the founder of their
house, they have always regarded
' city land as the best and safest
investment. Old John Jacob first be
came a real estate owner in 1789, when
he bought for $25 a lot of land on the
iJowery, near Elizabeth street. Twenty
one years later he was the largest holder
: of real estate in town, and bis descendants
have ever since kept the lead in this re
spect. In 1835 he sold the Astor House for
$1. William B. Astor had expressed a
desire to own it, whereupon John Jucob
told him that he would sell it to him for
I the amount named. The bargain was con
. eluded on the spot. The greatest care has
, always been taken to keep the exact value
of the Astor estate from becoming public.
I When John Jacob Astor the tirst died he
; was said to be worth At Wil
; Ham B. Astor's death it was reputed that
i he was worth $fX) 000,000, but this estimate
' has been declared too low. A few millions
i could be added with safety at present, and
every hour increases the valuation.
Ever since 1811 the Astor family has
been putting its spare change into Man
i hattan Island real estate. Rents which
accrued were reinvested with a particular
view to the location of the property. John
Jacob and William Waldorf have con
tinued to make investments in Harlem
i and the nfrw annexed district within a few
years. They keep a sharp eye on the
1 trend of trade and the growth of lew
districts. One real estate authority
: in speaking about the Astor land hold
ings, said that south of Eighty-sixth
' street it included twenty-five acres
|of soil solidly built up." Yet this
i large amount of property does ftot amount
j to more than halt of the Astor estate,
j which owns lands and buildings around
I Jerome Park and along Riverside drive
f and the boulevard. It is the business cus
j torn of the Astors to give leaseholds of
twenty-one years, on which the lessees
! build, the lease being snbject to n renewal
! at the end of twenty-one years on a re
appraisement. The ground rents for these
properties go to the estate, but on the as
] sessment books the property does not ap
i pear in the nan^e of the Astors. That's
why their great wealth is not getatable by
those people who are always poking their
noses into the t>rivate affairs of other peo
ple.âNew York Correspondence of Pitts

first and two second choices landing
purses.
Docile, sleopjsb-looking little Installa
tor lacked very firm support in the betting i
in the mile and a sixteenth handicap, but !
turned the trick very cleverly. In at one
pound less than Lo^an, who' was carryine j
top weight, 116 pounds, the ring laid 3 and j
o\i to 1 againtt him throughout. The j
"iron horse" was backed from threes to {
an 11 to 5 favorite, but Logan is not the,
Logan of some weeks back, and was clearly j
outfooted through the stretch. The three- :
year-old St. Lee led the rield a merry
chase to the stretch, where Installator
forged slightly ahead of him. In a wild |
drive to the wire St. Lee was beaten out j
three parts of a length by the Elmwood
stock farm representative In 1:47^. Basso,
well played by a few of the insiders, was a
good third.
In the fifth event, a seven-furlong run. |
Vinctor emulated the example set by his j
stable companion Installator, and downed
Lobengula, Yankee Doodle and Salisbury |
II in a rattling good race. The Doodle j
horse was an even money choice in the
betting, Vinctor being second in demand,
Dackea from 8t05t06 to 5. Salisbury II !
cut out the running to the far turn, where !
the other three starters passed him, and !
struck the stretch well bunched. While;
Chorn on Lobengula and Coady on the
favorite were having it hammer and \
tongs Sloan shook Vinctor up and passed
the fighting pair by the furlone pole and
came in a clever winner by a length. In
a great drive Lobengula secured the place
from Yankee Doodle by a nose.
Eleven were scratched out of the open
ing slx.furlong spin, leaving it a virtual
walk-over for Boreas. Bookmaker Rose's
horse was a 1 to 4 chance in the betting,
and leading all the way won easily from
Huntsman, with Road Runner in the
show.
The next event, over the inside course,
at seven furlongs, looked a "moral" for
Hid.i?o, and there was a heavy piay on
him at the Lhort odds ol 3 to 5, which was
soon rubbed to i to 2. He won as- he
pleased, with the second choiceâ Joe
Terryâ finishing in the place.
As usual, Barney Schreiber's honest
gray gelding, Braw Scot, was made favor
ite for the fourth race, over a mile, and
everybody on ttie track got aboard. He
won, but only by the narrowest of mar
gins. When tt>e stretch for home was
reached he was challenged by the 10 to I
outsider Fortuna, and the two ran locked
the last furlong. As the wire was passed
the white face of the Scot showed in front,
and he gained the verdict.
A speedy ban.d of sprinters was gathered
together in the last event of the day, a
six-furlong sprint. Nothing in the race
lacked support, the r.lay on Derfargiila
and Babe Murphy being particularly
heavy. Levena C was backed down sev
eral points, and Tim Murphy and Sir
Richard both had friends. Tim Murphy
and Levena C made the running to the
stretch, where Derfargilla, who had been
holding down third position, gradually
worked to the front, and at the end won
cleverly by a length from Babe Murphy,
with the other Murphy in the show.
DEATH OF W. H. WALLACE.
The Well-Known Native Son Carried
Oir by Consumption.
The funeral of the late William Henry
Wallace will take place at 2 o'clock to-day
from St. John's Presbyterian Church.
The American Bark Harry Morse as She Appeared After the Fog Lifted and She Had Been Towed to

Consumption was the cause of his death.
Mr. Wallace was a son of the late \V. H.
Wallace, who was a member of the firm
of Season, Wallace & Crocker. He was a
native son and a general favorite with a'l
who knew him. His deatli is a pad blow
to his mother and his favorite sister, Mrs.
C. W. Morton.
THE PRINCE DOLGOROUKI
He Is Here Bound to Peters-
burg to Witness the Czar's
Coronation.
The Nobleman Tells Why He Does Not
Anticipate War With
Japan.
Prince A. Dolgorouki of Russia, who for
some time past has been flag lieutenant of
the powerful Russian battle-ship. Emperor
Nicolas, now at Hongkong, arrived here
yesterday on the JieJgio.
The Prince is en route to Petersburg,
and will not return to China. He comes
of one of the most famous families in all
Russia, and along which a line of noble
men celebrated in Russian history has
sprung. From the Dolgoroukis came the
first princes of the empire, the lluriks, who
governed Russia. They arose in the
province of Twer in the very early times,
and ever since have been foremost in the
affairs of the nation. One of them was
Governor-General of Moscow, another was
once First Secretary of State, and Alex
ander II uoti his wife, as will be remem
bered, from the Doigoroulcis.
Prince Dolgorouki, now here, is an un
assuming gentleman scarcely more than
25 years old. He is a pleasant talker, and
takes a great interest in the affairs of
-Russia. He was asked if there was any
danger of a war between Russia and Japan,
us has been intimated in the dispatches
und otherwise.
"As to tiiat, I hardly think ther â  will be
any trouble," said the Prince, who is at
the Palace. "If any was anticipated there
would be something that would look like
preparation. At present there is no
preparation whatever.
"Mr. Chitrowo, the Minister from Rus
sia to Japan, who lias his headquarters at
Tokio, is to leave next week on the
9teamer, via Suez, for Petersburg, to be
present at the coronation of the Czar on
May 18. At the same time Colonel
Wojrak, the celebrated military agent of
Russia in China and Japan, will also leave
China for Petersburg. Mr. Dukofski,
the Governor-General of Eastern Siberia,
is alÂ«o at Petersburg.
'.'This i<> the best proof, I think, that
there won't be any war. All th; se gentle
men desire to be present at the coronation
of the Czar, and it is laigely for this rea
son that lam also hurrying homi. I have
never been in t?an Francisco before, and
the City pleases me greatly. I shall re
main here two or three days."
GreetiKweig; & Co. Sold Out.
A. Neubeuer, who is believed to represent
the Eastern creditors of George Greenzweig &
Co., the manufacturing jewelers of 2 Sutter
street, who failed some time ago, was the
highest bidder at the Sheriff's sale that was
held yesterday, getting the stock and fixtures
lor $20,000. Tht? liabilities of the firm were
$30,000, mostly with Eastern houses.

Strfcfel n by Apoplexy.
Mrs. Woods, an inmate of the Almshou:-?,
was found in an unconscious condition on
Seventh and MarK.et streets yesterday morning
and taken to the Receiving Hospital, she had
been stricken by apoplexy, and in falling her
head struck against the stone sidewalk, inflict
ing a scalp wound that may prove fatal.
A BARK'S NARROW ESCAPE
Came Within Twenty Yards of
Running on Alcatraz in
the Fog.
A FAST RUN FROM JAPAN.
The Harry Morse Nearly Made a
Disastrous Ending to a Suc
cessful Voyage.
After completing one of the fastest runs
made from Yokohama to San Francisco in
years the bark Harry Morse came within
twenty yards of going on Alcatraz T s ]and
in the fog yesterday morning. There was
a providential clearing up for a moment
just at the time the danger was most im
minent and Captain Lane at once let go
his anchors.
The bark was in ballast and did not
draw much water, otherwise there might
have been a different tale to tell. As it
was she was so dangerously cJose to the
island that the assistance of the tug Vigi
lant was gladly accepted and the Morse
was towed out of danger and again an
chored.
Captain Randall of the tug was on his
way to dock a ship, but when he saw the
predicament in which Captain Lane was
placed he at once went to his assistance
and towed the vessel to a safe anchorage.
The Harry Morse was so close to the island
when her anchors held that with the turn

The average passage for a steamer from
Yokohama to San Francisco is about six
teen days. The Harry Morse came over in
twenty-six days, thus making the smart
est passage in years. The best on record
hetween the points named was made by
the old clipper-ship Bonanza. That was
years and years ago, but old seafaring men
remember the circumstance well. The
Bonanza and the old side-wheel steamer
China left Yokohama together, and the
"wind-jammer" beat the steamer into
port by a day, making the run in the re
markable time of twenty days. It blew a
gale almost the whole way across, and as
it was a fair wind the captain of the Bo
nanza carried ail the sail the vessel could
stagger under. The China acted very badly
in heavy weather and it took four men at

were set in oraer to keep her up bu they
only added to the trouble, and finally the
captain had to settle down to dodging
along and making the best of things.

in a day ahead of hinl, he was the most
chagrined man in California.
Captain Lane reports that the Morse had
heavy but favorable weather throughout
the entire run. He was off port last
Wednesday, but could not get in on ac

sprang up last night he at once headed for
port and came in yesterday morning on

THE BUILDING TRADES.
Establishment of a General Union Head
- quarters cussed.
The establishment of a union headquar
ters was one of the important matters dis
cussed last evening at tne meetinz of the
Building Trades Council. This movement
was started over four months ago by the
several carpenters' and joiners' unions,
and a committee was appointed to exam
ine all the available buildings.
Last evening the subject was revived,
and H. M. Saunders, one of the old com
mittee, made a report. He said one or
two large buildings could be obtained at a
cost of about .'jiJOO a month on a long-term
lease. ]
These buildings can be altered and reno
vated so as to Lave a number of large
meeting-rooms, where all of the unions in
the building trades can meet and transact
tneir business. Other unions can also be
accommodated. The total amount of
money paid by these unions, now scat
tered all over town, if paid for better privi
leges in a union headquarters, would make
such an institution seif-supporting and
soon repay the outlay of putting in con
dition.
Tt was decided to submit the proposition
to the various unions.
Another subject of interest was con
sidered by the council. It was that of
holding monthly or semi-montblv mass
meetings, to which the public will be in
vited. This project will also be recom
mended to the unions.
In connection with the mass-meeting
proposition was another which will be
acted upon soon.
In many places in Europe and British
Columbia nearly all workingmon have a
half-holiday every Saturday afternoon. It
is prorosetl that this will be inaugurated

COLLECTOR WISE.
The Charges Against In
spector Martin Cleary
Dismissed.
MOORE LOSES A SCALP.
Another Skirmish Between the
Special Agent and the Col
lector Decided.
W. W. FOOTE ON HIS METTLE.
He Criticized the Deputy District
Attorney, Who Responded With
Considerable Spirit.
Collector Wise drew first blood in the
battle with Special Treasury Agent Moore
yesterday. It was all over the Cleary ca^e
The Defendant, the Special^ Agents of the Treasury Department and the Chinaman Who Had Suffered a
Lapse of Memory.
: . . : [From courtroom sketches by tt- M OHft*' artist.]
which was summarily dismissed by United
States Commissioner. Heacock, and the
young man was at o'nee reinstated as cus
toms inspector by the Collector.
Special Agent Moore swore to the charges
of bribery against the inspector. It was
charged that he ana Charles Faver. now at
large, had accepted $110 from Yuck Jung,
and that for the consideration the China
man was released from the responsibility
of being a vender of unstamped opium.
This case is an outcropping of the fight
between Special Agent Moore and Col
lector of the Port AVise. The Collector has
"Yon know what I think of you, sir," said W. W. Footo to Assistant United
States District Attorney Slessinger.
[Sketched in. court yesterday by a "Call" arlisl.]
a way of standing by those whom he be
lieves to be guiltless.
He thought Cleary's arrest was a matter
of epite on the part of Moore against
himself, and accordingly he stood by the
inspector, who has been in the service
quite a long time and enjoys a goodstand
ing in the community. He comes of an
excellent family, and'the insinuation that
he had gone into the business of a pro
fessional briber was, of course, indig
nantly repudiated. His uncle, M. F.
Tarpey, lest no time in going to his rescue,
and Las stood by the young man through
all his little troubles.
But the Oleary case is only a side issue
o the fight between Moore and Wise, and
the fact that the Collector scored the first
victory before the court yesterday seemed !
;to give general satisfaction about the i
I Custom-house, while the adherents of the !
; special agent were correspondingly de- j
pressed. .
The Cleary case was called before Com
missioner Heaeock at the morning ses
| sion. It was nothing more than a farce.
j A few Chinamen testified that they saw
the money paid to Charley Faver and that
I Cleary was present at the time, but when
cross-examined they knew very little.
Jones ran afoul of W. W. Foote
I several times during the examination, and i
i the bitterness which the attorney poured j
I out on the head of the master of Chinese
lingo was as amusing to the spectators as
it was humiliating to the subject of de-
I rision.
Wong Yuck. June: was the first witness !
called. His memory went back on him j
to a great extent and he proved a poor!
witness for the prosecution. He testified I
that he paid Wing Ling $110, and that the i
money was paid by the latter to Faver and i
I Clearv. The witness virtually admitted i
I that he had been coerced into giving cvi- j
dence against the accused by Special j
Agents Moore and Thomas. Another i
CUinaman called as a witness for ihe j
prosecution admitted that he had been
convicted for having unstamped opium in
Ws possession. Wong Yuck Jung testi- I
tied that Cleary had met him as he came j
out of the United States Grand Jury room
I and threatened to kill him if he gave cvi
! dence against him.
.Wong Ching testified that he was in the
room when the money was paid to two j
whita men, but was unable to identify |
Cleary as one of the men.
Several other Chinamen were called, and
all were unable to identity Cleary as hoy- '
ing received any of the money alleged to >
have been paid in the morning at the j
rooms of Yuck Jung in Chinatown.
James Henry Small was the first witness
for the defense. His evidence was to the;
effect that Moore and Thomas came to i
him and threateneel|t:rat if he did not say |
â  certain things damaging to Cleary they I
would arrest him and hold him as a wit
ness. . â¢
It was during the examination of this
witness at the afternoon, session of the
court: that Attorneys Foote and Slessinger
cams near "mixing" in the presence of the
Commissioner.
"I will take hold of you, sir," said Foote.
"Well, you can do it right here," replied
SleÂ«sjnger, with much spirit.
"Weil, you know you are bluffing," re
taliated Foote.
"No., I'm not bluffing," said the Assist
ant District Attorney.
"Y<m know what I think of you any
way," said Foote.
"Yes, and you know what I think of
yon," yelled Slessinger.
Then toe court called for order and the
attorneys cooled down.
The witness said that he did not carry a
note from Faver to Cleary on the morning
of February 7 when it was alleged the
money was paid over to the accused and
his companion.
"Did not Moore and Thomas threaten to
cause voux arrest unless you swore you took
a note to deary?" asked P'oote.
"Yes, they did," was the reply.
"Did you not tell both Moore and
Thomas that you had delivered a note from
Faver to. Cleary on the morning of Febru
ary 7?" inquired the District Attorney.'
"No, sir; I did not," replied the witness.
THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1896.
'Did you not say you saw Cleary at his
own home and that he had his lace band
aged up?"
â¢'I did not," replied Small.
"Do you know where Cieary lives?"
asked Foote.
"No, sir; I do not," was the reply.
Martin Cleary was called, and testified
to the effect that he was an Inspector in
the Custom-house. He denied tnat he was
present on February 7, when it was stated
he was present, when Faver received the
money. He was home until after 2 o'clock
p. m. that day, and was ill.
"You were prosecuted for drunkenness
by Major Moore, were you not?" asked
Foote.
"Yes, and I was vindicated," said the
witness.
On cross-examination Clearv said he did
not release or seize any opium on Feb
ruary 7. He was not in Chinatown on that
day at all. He knew Faver, and was sent
with him by Deputy Surveyor Kuddell to
make certain seizures of opium. He had
never threatened tbe life of a Chinese wit
ness.
Mrs. Grundy, the landlady at 939 Mis
sion street, where Cleary lives, testified
tnat he was at home all morning, being iJI
at ihe time. He left the house between 2
and 3 o'clock on February 7, 1896.
James Buchanan said he had known
Cleary for a number of years. Between 2
and 3 o'clock on February 7, 1896, he went
with Cleary to the office of Dr. Kohn and
remained with him until 4:30 o'clock,
leaving him at hi 3 lodgings at that hour.
Thomas Van Glann, grocer, corner of
Stockton and Sacrarceiito streets, testified
that Thomas and Moore called on him and
told him that Cleary was in trouble, and
that if he could testify that Cleary had
been at his place on the morning before he
would be doing him a favor. Thomas said
he was Cleary's friend.
The witness testified that he had
not seen Clearv on the morning when the
money was alleged to have been paid.
Several other witnesses were examined
to the same effect. Then M. F. Tarpey
l testified that he was with Cleary in the
! Federal building when the latter svas eaicl
I to have threatened a Chinaman. He swore
', that no such incident occurred.
Commissioner Heacock dismissed the
case, as there was no evidence pointing to
Cleary's guilt.
BURNED TO THE GROUND
Jeremiah Noonan's Establishment
on Mission Street in
Ashes.
The Loss on the Building and Contents
Is Estimated at About
$55Â»ooo.
What proved to be a disastrous fire
broke out in a one-story frame building at
1017-23 Mission street, owned and occupied
by Jeremiah Noonan as a furniture-store,
at 4 o'clock yesterday morning.
An alarm of fire was turned in from box
65 at 4:07 a. m., but by the time the Fire
Department had reached the location of
the fire the building was a mass of flames.
As soon as Chief Sullivan saw the danger
ous position of the neighboring buildings
he turned in a second alarm, which was
quickly responded to. It was soon discov
ered that it would be impossible to Have
the burning building, so the department
made great efforts to save those adjoining.
For a short period of time it seemed al
most certain that the entire block bounded
by Mission, Howard, Sixth and Seventh
streets would be entirely destroyed, but
fortunately the water supply was ample
and no wind was blowing. The building
in which the tire started was totally de
stroyed, owing to the inflammable mate
rial with which it was tilled.
The cause of the lire is as yet not known,
but it is being investigated by the Fire
Marshal. The fire was rirst discovered by
a paseer-by, who noticed smoke issuing
from the rear end of the building. Mictiael
Doyle, an employe who slept in the loft
of the store, was not aware ttiat the store
was in flames until the arrival of the Fire
Department.
The noise made in breaking in the front
doors awoke him, and upon seeing his
danger he rushed through the flames to
the windows fronting on Minna street and
jumped to the ground, where he lay un
conscious. He was picked up, and an ex
amination disclosed" the fact that he had
sustained quite severe injuries about his
head and lees and slight burns wliile es
caping through the flarues.
The adjoining buildings were slightly
scorched by the fire, but the loss, which
was nominal, was due to water. Mr.
Noonan estimates the loss on the building
at about $15,000 ana on the contents at
$40,000. The building and furniture' were
insured for $32,000. The report of the Fire
Patrol places the loss on the building at
$6000 and the contents at $18,000.
Held for Kobbery.
The preliminary examination of W. P. Fos
ter, proprietor of the Oriel Hotel, ou Market
and Page streets, on the charge of Tobbery,
was concluded before Judge Low yesterday,
and he was_held to answer before the Superior
Court in ij^jOO bonds. The complaining wit
ness was Josephine Mahoney, who charged
Foster with robbing her of $100 in the Bur
lington Hotel. Foster had preferred a charge
of grand larceny against tho girl for stealing a
pearl collar- but ton from him, but the charge
was dismissed.
THEIR REBATES
ALL VANISHED.
Militiamen Have a Griev
ance Against the
Railroad.
HAD TO PAY FULL FARE.
National Guardsmen Claim the
Company Broke Faith
With Them.
THE AGENT WAS OBDURATE.
Instead of a Reduction the Attendants
at the State Shoot Got an
Overcharge.
Unless they can obtain a speedy settle
ment with the Southern Pacific Company
seventy - live members of the National
Guard will take legal measures to adjust a
grievance they have against the corpora
tion.
On Washington's birthday that number
of militiamen attended the State shoot at
the capital, and it is over the manner they
were treated in the matter of fares that the
trouble arose.
It was arranged with the company that
if over fifty members of the guard attended
the shoot the round-trip fare to Sacra
mento, which is $5 from this City, should
be subject to a rebate of two-thirds of the
fare for the return trip.
In order to prevent, as the company
claimed, those not connected with the
guard from taking advantage of the rate
agreed upon, to pay half of the same and
thus get to Sacramento for a cheap fare,
the agents of the company collected $3 30
from each of the militiamen who left this
City. The company told them that the
payment of the one-thira of the return
trip fare would get them return tickets,
and they were given a receipt blank, on
the reverse side of which was the follow
ing agreement:
NOTICE TO ATTENDANT.
1. The receipt on the reverse side hereof will
be given by any ajjent in California of the

bought at any time prior to the close of the
meeting and allow stopovers at any inter
mediate point.

CERTIFICATE OF I. G. E. P.
Sacramento, Feb. 22, 1896.
I hereby certify that , attendant,
whose signature is given above, has been in
attendance at the meeting named. I further
certify that fiity or more persons holding cer
tificates of this form properly executed have
attended this meeting.
G. B. Spf.ru y, I. G. K. P.
Nothing was lacking from the receipt or
certificate of the inspector-general and
the party went to Sacramento on the
morning "of the 22d. The shoot closed,
during the same day the inspector signed
the blanks, arid the guardsmen went to'
the depot in the afternoon to get their re
turn tickets.
Each expected to get his return ticket
for 85 cents, which would be one-third of
the regular return fare.
To their astonishment the agent de
manded $2 50 full fare from each of those
who came from San Francisco. Those who
came from distant points, some from Los
Angeles and others from far northern
towns, were also compelled to pay full fare.
In vain the guardsmen protested and
showed their receipts and certificates filled
out in due form.
"I have received no instructions from
San Francisco regarding this rebate," said
the agent, "and you can pay or stay as
you like."
Several of the boys who had only
brought enough money to pay the fare
they had understood would be expected
were in a Quandary and were compelled to
borrow from their more opulent brethren
in order to reach their homes.
"This is the return we get for coming up
here and protecting your property during
the strike," said one.
They were compelled to produce the fare,
and the San Francisco boys instead of
getting through for $4 15, the agreed rate,
or even $5, the full regular fare, were com
pelled to pay $5 80 each to get home.
Those from Los Angeles fared even worse.
With a view of putting the agent on
record in his arbitrary manner -of charg
ing, as they looked at it, receipts were
demanded, and the San Franciscans re
ceived the following :
EECEirT FOR FARE PAID.
Received of , $2 50, for passage of
one adult from Sacramento to Son Francisco.
Ticket No. . . C J. Ellis, Agent.
Not good for passage.
Tbe blanks, certificates and receipts are
being iield as evidence, and unless the
company makes an amicable settlement,
suits will be brought for the rebate agreed
upon, and probably for damages.

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
First Trip of the Steamer Belgic
Since She Was Ashore
Near Kobe.
REPAIRS MAPE BY CHINESE.
Narrow Escape of Robert Emmerson,
an Apprentice on the North
west.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's Belgic arrived from Hong
kong, via Yokohama, yesterday morning.
This is her first voyage since she went
ashore on the coast of japan in September
last, and the officers say she is now as
good as new. Alter being towed off the
beach she was taken to Yokohama, where
she was patched up- She then went to
Hongkong under her own steam, and there
was docked and repaired. All the work
was done by Chinese cheap labor, and the
Southern Pacific Company is jubilant over
the saving that has resulted.
The repairs were superintended by the
engineers of tne steamer, and the "work
must have been well done, or else the Bel
gic could never have made the run from
Yokohama to San Francisco in 15 days
12 hours. The Chinese, on an average,
worked for 30 cents a day, and were glad
to get it.
There were only four cabin passengers.
They were: A. l)olgoronag, E. Grubitz,
W. Melchers and J. B. Slocuru. Mr. Doi
goronag is a Russian Prince, and Is a iieu
tenant in the Russian navy. He was on
the Chinese station, tut has been ordered
home to St. Petersburg, and is now on nis
way there. He says that peace reigns in
the Orient, and that all danger of further
trouble is over. E. Grubitz is from Shang
hai and W. Melchers from Canton.
Both gentlemen say that China is
rapidly recovering from the effects of the
late war and will soon be on a sound
financial basis again. J. B. Siocum was
formerly freight clerk on the steamer
Evandale, that made a couple of trips for
the Occidental and Oriental Company.
He will take charge of the purser's de
partment on the I)oric when that fine
vessel sails next month.
The Belgic brougut a large general
cargo aud among it were 12,236 packages of
tea and 542 packages of raw silk, besides
800 rolls of matting and other goods for
Eastern points. The vessel could not
dock owing to the state of the tide, so the
merchandise was landed on tugs, but the
passengers were left to gaze longingly on
the distant shore. Trip after trip "was
made by the Millen Griffith and the Pup,
and on each occasion the passengers
thought they would be landed. The
uteamer got in at 10 :30 A. m. and it was
not until 4:30 p. m. that the Millen
Griffith had time to take the passengers
aehore.
The Belgic has almost a complete new
set of officers. Captain J. H. Kinder, who
was formerly chief officer of the Gaelic, is
m command. He is very popular and a
thorougn seaman, so smart passages may
be expected from the Belgic in future,
The other changes are Coiel Officer Arm
strong takes the place of Chief Officer Tils-
ton and Second Officer Welsh takes the
place of Mate Beckman, who was drowned
when the steamer went ashore. Dr. Dud
ley, the surgeon of the ship, recovered the
body four days after the accident and em
balmed it. When the vessel reached Yoko
hama the remains were given Christian
burial.
Tom Mr 1 Kay, the well-known passenger
agent for the Buriinatori route, was a pas
senger on the Belgic from Hongkong to
Yokohama. Since he has been in the
Orient he has gained sijty pounds in
weight and he wants all his ban Francisco
friends to be acquainted with the fact.
When in San Francisco Tom's fighting
weight; with his diamonds thrown in, was
110 pounds.
The scow schooner Nettie and the Gov
ernment steamer McDowell were in col
lision yesterday. The schooner was
loaded with wheat and was preparing to
get away from Washington-street wharf.
The breast line was let go too soon and

Kobtsrt Emmerson, an apprentice on the
barkentine Northwest, very nearly lost his
life last "Wednesday night. The vessel
was on the Merchants' dryciock, and when
he got back from an' excursion uptown the
gates of the dock were closed. He at
tempted to get around the fencing at the
end of the wharf and fell into tne mud
and water.
He struggled vainly to free himself, and
as the tide was coming in the chances
were against him. Finally his cries for
help aroused the watch on the revenue
cutter Bear, and assistance was sent to
him. After he had been located by means
of lanterns a rope was thrown to him, and
after he had tied it around his body he
was hauled ashore, more dead than alive.
He was soon brought around, however, and
half an hour later was sound asleep in his
bunk on the Northwest.
The British ship Sierra Pedrosa, now at
Port Costa, is to load a cargo of rye for
Europe. This will be one of the first en
tire cargoes of the grain that has ever left
San Francisco. The Pedrosa brought a
cargo of cement from London here, and,
strange to say, there was not one of the
barrels damaged.
ON MOUNT TAMALPAIS.
Mr. Eager Says the Men Are Well and
"Wholesomely Fed.
C. R. Eager, president of the California
Construction Company, engaged in build
ing the scenic road on Mount Tamalpais,
declares there is no truth in the report tel
egraphed from Mill Valley of a strike
among the company's operatives. Mr.
Eager says the men are paid higher wasjea
and receive better treatment than railroad
laborers generally receive.
The story that the workmen are given
poor food, badly cooked. Mr. Eager de
.nounces as a falsehood. The men receive
$1 75 a day for their labor and are charged
75 cents a day for board. The contractor
admits that the cuisine does not compare
with that of the Palace Hotel, b'tit says the
food is plentiful, wholesome and properly
prepared. The company, Mr. Eager aays,
will not employ Chinese.

AT HIS WORD
A Young Mother- and Her
Two Babies Fleeing
to England.

She Says Another Woman Hard
Stolen Her Husband's
Affections,
ONLY MARRIED THREE YEARS.
Mr. Higgs Said "Let Her Go," and a
Couple of Hours Later She
Went.
Oakiaxs Office Fan Franci^o C\ll }
90S Broadway, Feb. L 7.' [
Mrs. Richard Higgs, the youn X wife of a
weii-known business man of this city, is
MRS. RICHARDS B(GGS, NOW FLEEING TO ENGLAND \Y ITH HER TWO BABIES
â  across the continent with ncr two
children and the husband is doing all in
â  ".rer to prevent her leaving the coun
try with them. The aid of the police de
partments and Sheriff'? offices in several
counties has been invoked, but so far the
refugees have been unmolested.
The young wife had a full day's start be
fore her husband discovered that she had
gone, and, as she purchased a through
ticket to England, ..there is no room for
doubt regarding her intentions.
Mr. and Mrs. Higgs have not been mar
lied many years, but, according to the
young wife's story, love long since : fled
from their home. The domestic skeleton
was dotted with apparent harmony till
after the birth of the second baby, which
occurred about^three months ago. The
unhappy young mother told her story to
her neighbors. "With tears in her eyes
and a tiny babe In her arms she recounted
the circumstances attending her unbappi
ness. â  ':" â 
Some time ago the..Higgs family lived at
513 Twentieth street,- but a few months
after marriage serious illness in the wife's
family made it imperative that she go to
New Zealand if ehe, would see her mother
before she died. The visit was made, and
on her return Mrs. -Higgs found that there
was a marked difference in her husband's
manner toward her. â¢
"We went to live at Sixth and Harrison
streets," said Mrs. Higgs the evening be
fore she tied to England, "and my hus
band seemed to have" no further affection
for me. We got along as well as I could,
but it was very hard, and each day made
it worse. A "married woman seemed to
exercise a strange influence over my hus
band. She had complete control of him
and he did not seem able to exercise any
self-control at all. Several times we dis
cussed our unhappiness, and each time he
would promise to be as he once was, but
his promises were invariably broken.
When I returned from New Zealand, in
stead of receiving tile loving welcome I
expected, I was received very coldly, and
I found that I was more de trop than ever.
"Occasionally the woman who had
usurped the place in my husband's affec
tions came to our house. 1 forbade her
darkening my door, but she paid no atten
tion to me and defied me to have her out
out. After this had gone on for several
months I decided to move to a new neigh
borhood and went out to Twentieth street.
For a time I thought that the woman had
dropped out of sight, but i was quickly un
deceived. " '. â  '-', Â,,, . ,
"About three months ago ray little baby
was born. Just before its birth Mr. Higgs
bought a bicycle and after that he was
away from home all the time. I was alone
with my two children and 1 made up Imy
mind that when: 1 was strong enough I
would go to my friends in Wales. I aeain
protested against my husband's doings
and instead of even listening to me he told
me to mind my own business and he would
do as he pleased. We had a quarrel and :
Mr. Higgs packed his trunk and moved
downtown." Â â,
A week ago Mrs. Higgs placed her affairs
in the hands of a lawyer and a settlement
of $15 per month was agreed upon and $-00
cash down. Mr. Higgs was extremely
fond of his oldest child and was very kind
to it. After the settlement neither hus
band nor wife saw each other and neither
suggested a divorce. â â¢
Last Tuesday Mrs." Hirers called in an
auctioneer and Â«oid all her furniture, which j
she bays her husband had given to her. ,
As an auction would have attracted atten- j
tion she sold it for a lamp sum. This ,
money and the $200 received from her .
husband were sufficient to enable her to |
carry out her idea, and Tuesday evening
Bbc went to the ticket-office and purchased
a ticket for Europe. â¢
The most surprised man in Oakland was ,
Mr. Higgs, when he learned that bis wife i
had gone and taken tiieir two children. I
It was at first supposed that she had gone
U> h6r brother-in-law, Mr. Owen, in Fruit
vale. bat investigation proved that she
had been accompanied to the Sixteenth
street depot by Mr. Owen and a lady
friend. Mr. Higgs lost no time in trying
j to intercept his wife's flight before she got
i out of the State, but he has not yet learned
; anything definite. He at drat thought ht
J could find her in San Francisco, but the
j hour; he spent searching that City were
helping to place her farther from the
scenes of her unhappfnesa.
The evening before taking her flight
; Mrs. Higgs made a final attempt to effect
â  a reconciliation with the father of her
I little ones. Mr. Owen, the brother-in-law,
interviewed Mr. Higgi and the latter in
sisted that he would not return to hi?
wife. Mr. Owen replied that if that -was
: bis final answer Mrs. Higgs would leave
j Oakland. Higgs replied "'Let her go," but
. snowed by his manner that he had no idea
! she would do so. Two hours after the de
j cision of the busband was made known 10
; the young wife she was on her way home
j with her babies to relatives in Wales.
The HigKS have only been married three
years, and the eldest child, Gladys, is not
j quite two years old. Before her marriage
Mrs. Higgs was Miss Serene Johns and
lived with her sister, Mrs. Owen. Her
husband is manager for the Oakland
branch of a San Francisco lirin of grocers.

MARCEAUS LIVING APART
i Agreed to Separate and May
Institute Divorce Pro
ceedings.
' Said to Be One of Many Marital
Infelicities During Their Three
Years' Union.
Mr. and Mrs. Theodore C. Marceau are
living apart by mutual agreement, and the
assertion is not contradicted that this last
, of their many marital infelicities will end
in more than a temporary separation fol
lowed by the usual reconciliation.
The husband is occupying rooms con
nected with his Market-street photograph
gallery, while Mrs. Marceau, recently
joined by her mother, holds undisturbed
possession of the luxurious apartments in
the Palace Hotel.
It is asserted by thope claiming to know
that several times the wife had taken the
preliminary steps to a divorce on the
; ground of alleged cruelty, but was on each
occasion eventually reconciled to her hus
band tnrough the interference of friends.
Messrs. Dunn and McPike, Mrs. Mar
ceau's attorneys, would say only that a
temporary separation had been agreed
I upon. .But they refused to say whether or

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 28, 1896.
CHANDLER TO
SUCCEED MORSE.
An Eastern Divine for
President of the Bap
tist College.
TRUSTEES ARE TO MEET.
They Have Decided to Accept
the Resignation of Pro
fessor Morse.
TEN YEARS' USEFUL WORK.
General Desire to Strengthen the
Union of Baptists in the East
and West.
Oakland Offich Fan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 27. f
The trustees of California College have
decided to accept the resignation of Presi
dent Samuel B. Morse, and it is almost
certain that an Eastern man, Dr. E. K.
Chandler of Massachusetts, will be ap
pointed his successor.
There are several reasons advanced why
an Eastern divine should be chosen, the
main one being that at present there is not
a very strong bond of union existing
between the East and "West. It was for
the purpose of strengthening this bond
that the National anniversaries were orig
inaily intended to be held this year at
Portland, Or. A few days ago the West
ern city was discarded for an Eastern sea
board city, and this action seemed to
dampen tne ardor of those who were work
ing for closer union.
Now it is thought that the work on the
Pacific Coast will receive a fresh impetus
by the appointment of an Eastern presi
dent to the head of the only Baptist theo
logical college on the coast.
The Baptist denomination of the West
is awaiting the action of the trustees in
regard to the selection of a successor to
Rev. Samuel B. Morse, D.D., who has been
at its head for ten year? past and brought
it through the period when it needed the
hardest work and keenest executive ability
to keep it from being an utter failure.
The work of rinding a man just suited to
carry on the work so well iounded is one
of great responsibility, a fact that is fully
appreciated by the board of trustees at
this time.
Tiie trustees of the institution are se
lected from the ministerial force and lay
men of the citate Baptist Convention, and
includes some of the best and most in
fluential members of the denomination.
They are elected for five-year terms and
are divided into rive classes, running for
terms of one, two, three, four and five
years respectively. The board, as it stood
at the last annual meeting, was as follows.:
Class Iâ C. H. Hobart, Oakland; W. T.
Jordan, Alameda; H. L. Gear, San Fran
cisco.
Class 2â J. Q. A. Henry, San Francisco;
G. M. Coulter, Batavia; A. L. White, East
Oakland.
Class 3â H. E. McCune, Dixon; W. R.
Gallup, Sacramento; J. H. Stevens, San
Francisco.
Class 4â C. N. Whitmore, Ceres; J. C.
McMullin, Oakland; Z. L. Orcutt, San
Jose.
Class 5-G. S. Abbott, D.D., Oakland;
William P. Todd, Oakland; C. M. Hill,
East Oakland.
The officers of the board are: President,
Ken. H. E. McCune, Dixon; secretary, C.
H. Hobart, Oakland; treasurer, J. H.
Stevens, 212 Sansome street, San Fran
cisco.
These three, with A. L. White and H.
L. Gear, constitute the executive com
mittee.
A meeting of the board has been called
for Thursday next, to consider the selec
tion cf Dr. Morse's successor and to attend
to other business that may be presented.
One item is to select a new member for
the board to fill the unexpired term of
Rev. J. Q. A. Henry, lormerly of San
Francisco, but who is now filling a pulpit
in Chicago.
A number of tbe leading members of
the church in this city who feel a vital
interest in college affairs have been feel
ing about to find who might be considered
available for the vacancy. President Bron
son of the McMinville (Or.) Baptist Col
lege has been mentioned, but there are
grave doubts whether he would give up
his present position, and then there are
many who feel that an Eastern man is
needed, so as to tie the denomination
on the coast to that east of the Rocky
Mountains. This latter element is be
lieved to be in the majority.
Rev. E. K. Chandler, D.D., of Massa
chusetts has been considered by a number
of the trustees, and by many is* believed to
be the man who will be chosen. He comes
of Puritan stock, and his iatner was one
of those who stood by the McMinnville
College when its existence was threatened.
He is a man of sufficient age to command
the confidence and respect of the ministe
rial brethren of the coast, and at the same
time young enough to carry forward suc
cessfully the work beguu by Dr. Morse.
One minister in speaking of him to-day
said: "He is in every way fitted for the
position if he could ha secured. We need
a man now that will accept fully the great
responsibility that will be laid upon him.
Dr. Morse has clone a noble work, a work
which he can now Jay down and in after
years be called blessed by the church. In
laying it down now ha will always carry
the grateful remembrance cf those who
will go to school here in the years to come.
We want a younger man now to take the
work up and push it along up hill."
Rev. I. D. Wood, district missionary for
the American Baptist Home Missionary
Society of Philadelphia, is very emphatic
in favoring an Eastern man." He said:
"We want a man for president who will
tie the Baptists of the East and West more
firmly together. Dr. Morse has done well
in this work and now no mistake must be
made in choosing his successor. We have
had the anniversaries taken from us, and
if everything is not done that is possible
there will be a division of the West from
the East and a new convention formed
entirely."

THE ALMA TRUSTEES.
Courts Asked to Enjoin Them
From Enlarging the Elec
tric Plant.
Recapture of a Chicken-Thief Who
Jumped From a Train at
Full Speed.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 27.â A complaint
was tiled in the Superior Court to-day that
will make a stir in Alameda. John T.
Fleming appears as a petitioner, and prays
for an order of court restraining the Eoard
of Municipal Trustees from carrying on
certain contracts, involving the expendi
ture of a large sum of money to enlarge
the municipal electric plant for the chief
purpose of engaging in the business of fur
nishing commercial lightÃ to private con-
I sumers. The petitioner represents himself
to be a property-owner and taxpayer; that
the only appropriation necessary for the
maintenance of the electric work 3is one
which would meet the cost of operating
and neceasary repairs; bit the Municipal
Trustees, in fixing the tax levy for 1895-00,
largely increased the rate for the purpose
of purchasing the power and appliances,
so that artilicial light may be sold to
householders and residents; that it is in
tended to expend a s-um approximating
$30,000 for this increase; that the city has
called for proposals to erect buildings, in
stall machinery, etc., and unless restrained
from entering into such contracts it will
be compelled to defend a multiplicity of
lawsuits owing to the illegality of said
contracts; that the Municipal Trustees
have not by ordinance passed by a two
thirds vote submitted to the electors the
proposition to so increase the electric
WOJTKS, and by reason of these facts the pe
titioner and other taxpayers are irrepara
bly injured.
The move is not backed by any consider
able number of taxpayers and its signifi
cance is not understood. The board has
i already let contracts approximating $20,
--000, but no work has yet commenced.
There was expended last year in expan
sions the sum of $19,000, and with this ad
dition, it is claimed, wili so increase the
incandescent plant .that enougn light may
be sold to pay for what the municipality
uses. When the tax levy was made last
October the rate of 1.22 was decided upon.
One dollar on -the $100 would have met all
the usual requirements and there was great
dissatisfaction that the rate siiould have
been so high. The reason of the increase
was kept secret at the time and it did not
transpire till some time after that the extra
fund to be raised was to be put. into addi
tions to the electric light.
A Criminal Recaptured.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 27.â Police Offi
cer Aloe bus to-day arrested in San Fran
cisco a prisoner who escaped from his cus
tody on the Bth of January last. On that
date he was detailed 10 watch for chicken
thieves, who were devastating the hen
roosts in the westerly part of the city. At
5 o'clock in the morning of the day men
tioned he found a man traveling toward
the city on the iirst narrow-gauge train
with a basket of chickens in his posses
sion. The thief was arrested on the way
out to the landing and kept aboard the
train until the return trip was begun.
About 150 yards from the landing the
prisoner made a dash for liberty, rushing
through the car door and jumping from
the train while it was at tall Â«peed and
disappearing utterly, it was not yet light
enough to distinguish clearly. How the
man escaped death as he alighted on the
ties is a mystery, but he did not seem to
have been injured even, for Officer Moebus
found him at the Clay-street Market this
morning with his customary basket of
chickens, which he had presumably got
in the same way in which he had acquired
those in Alameda. He is now in the City
Prison, with a charge of burglary against
him. He gives his name a3 J. Doughtery.

Density of I'opulation,
The density of population in this Lon
don area was 373 persons to the acre,
auainst 168 persons to the acre in the
whole of Bethna) Green. There are three
wards iv New York City more densely
Populated. Of them the Tenth Ward
shows a density of more than 62L This is
in a large measure due to the greater
height of the New York buildings; but
covering as they do in some especially bad
blocks, almout, if not quite, as large a pro
portion of the ground area as those de
stroyed in London, it is not likely that
their upper stories get more light and air
than the two stories which made up the
London rookeries, and it is likely that
their lower stories get a great deal less.â

POVERTY OF A PIONEER
David McNea, Once Successful,
Dying in a Garret and
in Need.
INCREASED POSTAL RECEIPTS.
Bicyclists Interested in the Improve
ment and Widening of the
County Road.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,^
908 Broadway. Feb. 27. \
Old David McNea is dying in poverty
and want. McNea is a pioneer resident
of Oakland, and is one of the earliest set
tlers of California. For a great portion of
his life he knew prosperity, but ill luck !
overtook him, and now, in the late even
ing of his life he is dying and in want.
McNea is past 75 years of age, and for
the last five years has inipported himself
by peddling thread, needles and notions.
For six months sickness has kept him
from doing much work, and he has been
dependent for charity on hie landlady.
He is lodged in a bare attic bedroom,
half dead from congestion of the lungs.
Dr. Mayne has been called in attendance,
and pronounces McNea's case a very criti
cal one. McNea is a man of culture and
refinement, but possesses no relatives, and
his friends seem to have disappeared as
old age and sickness overtook him.
THE COUNTY ROAD.
Several Towns Are Interested in Having
It Widened.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 27.â The widen
ing of the San Leandro road, which is
patronized by thousands of wheel mem
from all around the bay, is just now en-,
gaging the attention of cyclists. The Hay
wards electric road has a franchise for a
double track, and before many years it
will doubtless avail itself of its right for
the whole distance. At present it is being
doubje-tracsed only so far as San Leandro.
The business onthe road is now enor
mous and it vanes from tiO to 100 feet in
width. Should a second track be laid it
will seriously affect the space available for
cyclists. As some of tne races now held
at the San Leandro triangle attract from
4000 to 6000 people, the towns along the
road are anxious to see all possible induce
ments offered to improve the road.
Mr. Stone, secretary of the Haywards
electric road, said to-day that he "under
stood the grade of the road between San
Leandro and Haywards was to be widened
at once by the county government.
There is also a narrow place in the road j

near Fitchburg," said Mr. Stone, "where a ,
creek encroaches upon the roadway. The [
railroad company has offered to haul the â 
material needed for widening the road i
there, and will do it without charge if the j
county will undertake to control the creek i
and prevent it from washing away the dirt
as fast as it is put in.
"As for widening the road, it is some
thing which ought to be done in places,
and we have pet a good example. Some
years ago the fences along tne Stone prop
erty were moved back twelve or fourteen j
feet and all the other property-owners be- j
tween Elmhurstand San Leandro did the j
same. This was on the south side. For I
some distance, in Elmhurst, we moved the
line back forty feet, in order to give a
street south of the railroad tracks. The I
San Leandro road has a great future, and j
.the guttering and paving with permanent I
materials ought to be attended to. But I i
question whether the road could be lined
with rows of trees without making too
much dampness."
RELEASED AND ARRESTED.
Mrs. WlUinoro Dismissed on One
Charge, but Is Still in Jail.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 27.â Judge Wood
decided this morning that the evidence
against Mrs. Willmore was not sufficient
to warrant holding her and dismissed the
charge. A new charge was, however,
served upon her and the evidence is con
sidered stronger than it was on the one
just dismissed. The new complaint states
that Mrs. Willmore received the proceeds
of the Girard robbery.
The virosccution oelieve they can show
that Mrs. 'Willmore stated sliortjy after
the Girard robbery that she heard the ex
p'.osion and feared it was a revolver fusil
ade between the hoys and the officers.
In the Superior Court Judge York of Los
Angeles, who is sitting for Judgo Greene,
conducted a private examination in the
case of Burt Willmore. There is little
doubt that the boy will be sent to a reform
school.
A GROWING SKRVICK.
More Postal Business Being Done Than
Ever Before.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 27.â Postmaster
White has forwarded to Washington a re
port for the quarter ending December 31.
It is the most encouraging report ever is
sued from the local department, and if the
receipts are maintained the gross total for
the present riscal year will be over $100,
--000. As it is on the basis of receipts that
the number of carriers is decided, Post
master White is anxious for the increase
to continue. He will then be able to
secure better service in the delivery de
partment.
Some months ago the Merchants' Ex
change helped a movement to induce mer
chants and others having interests on both
sides of the bay to make their purchases
of stamps in Oakland so as to swell the re
ceipts. There seems to have been & favora
ble response, judging by the report. The
total expenses of running the iocal office
for three months is $13,030 25.
UNSTAMPED OPIUM.
Deputy Sheriff Quintan Makes Hia Third
Successful Haul.
OAKLAND, Caju, Feb, g27. â Deputy
Sheriff Quinlan made his third haul of
unstamped opium at Fruitvale station last
night. As on former occasions it was Chi
nese who were attempting to take it across
the^bay on the local train that he caught.
He secured fifty cans of "dope" and three
Mongolians, who are now in the County
Jail awaiting an examination before a
United States Commissioner. They gave
the names of Ah Goon. Sam Sam and Sem
Toy.
The Chinamen carried the opium in a
black hand-satchel and a couple of rice
mats. It was rirst wrapped in paper and
then stored away. The frequency of these
hauls leads the officers to believe that there
is a factory in the vicinity where the drug .
is cooked and they are making a diligent
search for it. So "far no trace of such a
place has been found.
Whitney Act Upheld.
OAKLAND. Cal., Feb. 27.â Judge Ells
worth said this morning that as before
intimated he wa3 of the opinion that the
writ of habeas corpus in the case of At
torney T. F. Garrity and of Ah Quay, upon
which the constitutionality of the* Whit
ney act was raised, should "be denied and
the petitioners be remanded.
Ex-Mayor Chapman requested that the

STILL GREATER SUCCESS
Cathode Ray Photographs Made
in Two and a Half
Minutes.
University Professors Experimenting
in Order to Simplify the
Processes.
BE RKELEY, Cal., Feb. 27.â The most
successful cathode-ray photography yet
done at the State University, considering
the time expended in the exposure of ob
jects to the ray, was completed to-day. A
bullet was placed on top of Instructor J.
N. Le Conte's hand between the meta
carpel bones of the first and second fin
gers, and after an exposure of only fifteen
minutes the negative was developed. It
showed the position of the bullet and the
perfect skeleton of the hand as clearly as
on a plate which was exposed for one hour
last week.
A purse containing two coins and a key
and a piece of plaster of paris and some
paralline were to-day expose 1 to the influ
ence of the ray for only two and a half
minutes.
One reasonably clear photograph was
taken of the purse with only fifty-seven
minutes' exposure. When the first experi
ments with photographing the same purse
were made last w eeK an hour was required
before an equally dear negative was pro
duced. Professor Cory stated to-day that
a general simulirication of the apparatus
has made it possible to get good results in
a brief space of time. To-day no condenser
was use tl and a greater amount of power
was put into operation. The experiment
ers have found that the more simple their
apparatus the more effective will be the
results.
One important point which has mani
fested itself to them is the fact that there
is as much danger of having poor results
from overexpovare of the plate as there is
in an underexposure. On this one point
they have found it necessary to exert their
keenest scientific skill. They have found
that much of their success depends upon
their judgment in this one particular.
The time required for the exposure to the
ray depends largely upon the object to be
photographed. Its size and density are
both to be considered.
The distance from tne powerful
Crookes tube to the object to be phuto
grapbea is, under ordinary circumstances,
set at about five inches.
Professor Cory stated to-day that Mr.
Drew, Mr. Le Conte, Mr. Lange, the pho
tographer, and himself are trying to get
their apparatus in the best possible work
ing order. They will probably not do any
more spectacular work until several days
hence.
'â¢We have several scientific plans on
hand," said Le, "and we are now going to
see if anything can be made out of them.
We have proven to our own satisfaction
that we can throw a light through certain
ordinary objects by the use of considerable
care and exertion, and what we now pro
pose to do if possible is the same if not
better work, with iess effort, by means of
improved apparatus."
Professor fcflate and Instructor Drew of
the department of physics are still experi
menting with cathode-ray photography,
using the sunlight as an agent instead of
electricity.

to his wife once more through. the medium
of a suit for maintenance was on the wit
ness-stand yesterday.
His testimony was pointed and went to
show that his desertion was ratlier the re
sult of a cause than. a careless act. He
said lie used to come home regularly until
the note from his wife, published yester
day, saying that he might stay where he
was as she intended to sue for a divorce,
was sent to him. He says that note
was suiiicient to keep him away, but he
went home again. He had bent word
home that he would not be home to din
ner, and he instanced this as proof of the
fnct that it was not his custom to remain
away. After going back again, he said his
wife used to sit up at night to deliver car
tain lectures to him, and he had on more
than one occasion to leave the house and
take a room in some hotel in order to get
some sleep.
Regarding his son he said he had al
ways kept track of him. He pad gone
down to where he worked, he had waited
at the depot when the 'ooy came in from
the country on Sunday evenings and he
had ridden up and down on tne California
street cars merely on the possiblity of see
ing the faces oi his son and his wife at the
window of the house where they lived.
He said further that his will was made in
favor of his wife and. son and that it had
been executed long before the .action for
maintenance was brought against him.
He told, too, how he had carried his son's
picture in his pocket fcr all tbose yeare,
and to prove his words he drew a "faded
photograph from his old pocket-book and
showed it to the Judge.
MeMnilia said that he had been and
still is willing to take his wife back at any
time and to provide for her and their aon
a suitable home.
The testimony in the case i 3 finished
and arguments will be heard on March 6.
One of John Randolph's Similes.
Much new material is embodied in the
article "John Randolph of Roanoke, " by
Powhatan Bouldin in the March Century.
The following simile by Randolph is
found in a note to a speech which he de
livered in Congress :
A caterpillar comes to a fence; he crawls
to the bottom of the ditch and over tne
fence, some of his hundred feet always in
contact with the subject upon which he
moves. A gailant, horseman at a flying
leap clears both ditch and fence. "Stop,"
says the caterpillar; "you want connec
tion and continuity*; it took me an hour to
get over; you can't be as sure as I am,
who have never quitted the subject, that
yon have overcome the difficulty and are
fairly over the fence." "Thou "miserable
reptile!" exclaims our fox-hunter, "if like
you I crawled over the earth slowly and
painfully, should I ever catch a fox, or be
anything more than a wretched cater
pillar."
An imperial bacteriological laboratory is
to be established at Agra, and an imperial
chemical laboratory at Calcutta, by the
Government of India. Other laboratories
on a smaller scale will be established in
each of the presidencies, and all health
officers are to have six months' teaching in
bacteriology.

Strange Things Going On!
All the Folks Surprised !
Mem.â A man pounded his finger;
â  lost fifteen minutes' time, curing it.
Another got a whack square in the
eye. He was docked one hour"
pay â could then see out of it and
went to work again.
Still another had sat up nights
with Felons, tried cocaine and
opium, but the agony had got
there first and would not yield.
Finally his wife, who had cured her
tender feet, gave him a pointer and

For he says he
"Was Asleep in Ten Minute."

Worse Than the Disease.
Many ot the remedies prescribed by the
physicians in the old days were more to
be dreaded than the sufferings consequent i
on the disease. Rheumatic people were
buried up toxhe neck in mud baths.
Consumptive patients had cows intro
duced into their rooms, the breath of
these animals being regarded as a specific.
Gold and pearls were taken internally i
by the patients who could afford the rem- i
edy. Baxter relates how be nearly lost j
his life from swallowing a golden bullet.
John Wesley, in his "Primitive Physic,"
prescribes "six middling pills of cobwebs"
for ague. "The balsam of bats" was a fa
vorite remedy of court physicians.
A medical adviser of Queen Elizabeth
used to prescribe a smail young mouÂ«e,
roa-ted, for a child afflicted with a nervous
disorder.
Soap was more valued internally used \
than otherwise. It was prescribed by a i
great medical light who, it is said, died
after he had taken 200 pounds weight of
Â«o;ip.
Much virtue was ascribed ghastly things.
A ring made of ttie hinge of a coffin was
said to relieve cramps.
Ague was said to be infallibly cured if
the -ufferer wore in a bag around the neck
chips from a gallows on which several per
sons had been hanged. â Chicago Record.

ANARCHISTS TO
ORGANIZE HERE
Pietro Gori's Followers to I
Band Themselves
Together.
WILL BE DONE PUBLICLY
â
He Was Exiled From Switzer
land for Making Such
a Society.
HOW GORI SOWED THE SEEDS.
Two Clever Purpose Plays That Will
Be Produced Next Sunday.
"Thy Neighbor."
The anarchists of this City are about to
organize under the leadership or Pietio
Gori.
A few weeks ago San Francisco did not
know the meaning of the word anarchist
in any practical way. Reports had come
from Chicago and other centers from time
to time of anarchist doings, but the Far
West knew none of these things except by
hearsay. All that is changed now, how- j
ever. One of the most brilliant anarchists |
of modern times has been in this City
making an active propaganda for several [
weelts, and the result of his instructions is !
that the local anarchists now feel them- j
eeJves strong enough to organize formally, j
If Pietro Gori bad spoken in English in- j
stead of Italian, as he has been doing, the ;
largest hall in the City would probobly j
have been too small to accommodate his [
listeners. He is not only a convincing !
speaker, this young lawyer who was ex- !
iled from home and country on account of
his fanatical devotion to the principles of
Proudbon, but he is an orator of the type
that sways the multitude, and lately he
has been exercising his oratorical powers
in a tongue unknown to the City Fathers,
it is true, but a tongue in which he has
found many ready listeners. The result
of his eloquence will be seen in a few days
in the formal organization of a band of
anarchists in San Francisco.
"We do not intend to make any secret of
our organization," said Signor Gori yester
day. "Everything will be open and above
board. We snail organize and then I shall
go to carry on the propaganda elsewhere. !
The date of our forma! banding together is
not yet fixed, but it will probaDJy be in a
few days."
When .Signor Gori attempted to organize
a band of anarchists in Switzerland he
was promptly expelled from that land of
liberty. Among all the continental coun
tries of Europe there is not one that gives
its people more individual liberty than
ttie little Alpine republic, but the authori
ties draw the line at incipient anarchist
organizations. When Mr. Gori was ex
pelled from Switzerland tie was associated â .
with a newspaper 111 Lugano, where his
brilliant pen was beginning to make him a
power in the canton.
The editors of the paper managed to es
cape being mixed up in the anarchist
affair, though some suspicion of aiding
the propaganda fell upon them at the
time. It was a great grief to Gori to be
exiled from Lugano, for from the adjoining i
mountains he could look down upon the
plain of Lombardy and the city of Milan,
from whence his principles had caused ;
him to be exiled by tne Italian Govern- ;
ment.
Although an anarchist boasts that he has
no country and no fatherland, Gori must
have felt being banished from the frontiers
of Italy, for when forced to leave Switzer
land he wrote a poem, "Adieu to Lugano,"
which is considered one of the finest con- j
tributions to modern Italian poetry.
Rumor says that Mr. Gori was also ban
ished from England for preaching too pro
noaneed a type of anarchy, but this has [
not been proved. Indeed the anarchist :
himself says that the peopie who share his
belief always advise their followers to go j
to the Continent when they feel the de- \
sire to throw bombs grow too strong to be I
controlled, for that England has . not !
shown herself inhospitable enough to the :
brotherhood to deserve being subjected to ;
such inconveniences as bomb-throwers.
Whether he was banished from England I
or not Gori came to America resolved to i
devote his most remarkable talents to i
making a propaganda in this country, i
There is .little doubt but that he is the I
agent of a society that exists in the East!
and is affiliated with similar organizations
in Europe, only in the older and less free .
countries more caution has to be observed !
and ihe propaganda has to be carried on j
to a gre.at extent in secret. Santo Ctesario
was banished from Italy for distributing
anarchist handbills which were very mild
indeed compared to some of the brilliant i
flights of oratory in which Pietro Gori has
indulged.
With his talents, Pietro Gori could be
making a fortune at the bar. for he is a
lawyer by profession, but he has the bee of j
anarchy in his bonnet, and has sworn to j
live and die for the cause. Every one
knew, when he arrived in San Francisco,
that he was not here for his health. Be
fore he had been a day in the City his
winning manners and facile tongue won
him followers. During the weeks that he
has talked in public and private, he has
been, as lie himself say;*, "sowing the
seeds of anarchy." The crop is almost
ready for tiie harvest now, and in the
course oi a few days the result of Gori's
labors will be seen in organization of
the first band of anarchists west of the
Rockies.
There is great interest in the Italian
colony in the performance of Pietro
Gori's two plays, which will take place
next Sunday evening in Apollo Hall.
Both works have been highly spoken of
by the critics in Italy. The drama which
will be performed first is called 'Troorimus
Tans" ( Thy Neighbor). It takes its name
from a statue by a famous Italian sculptor,
representing a woman in the depths of
poverty and called 'Thy Neighbor" in a
spirit of satire at the way in which the ex
isting state of society fails to fulfill tha
Scriptural injunction of loving its neigh
bor as itself. The scene of "Proximus
Tuus" is laid in a pawnshop.
The other play, "II Primo Maggio" (The
First of May). deals with social questions,
and is said to show its writer to be a disciple
of Ibsen in his dramatic methods. It is
described as a symbolic drama, and has a
prologue in verse. A number of Italian

WOULD NOT ACQUIT.
A Jury in Hip Haskell Case Would Not
Obey the Court's
Order.
B. G. Haskell was before Judge Bahrs
yesterday on a trial for embezzlement.
The complaining witness, William H.
Young, alleged that Haskell collected
$1000 upon a compromise of a case in which
he was interested, and that he turned over
no part of it to its rightful owner. Haskell
was retained for 25 per cent of the receipts
of the case, and so of the $1000 he should
have turned over $750 to Young.
The defense or cross-examination drew
out the fact that the complaining witness
had on May 13 accepted Haskell's note for
the $750. The compromise had been made
on February 14. This acceptance, the
defense contended, was an admission on
the part of the defense that Haskell was a
debtor and not an embezzler of Young's
money.
When the prosecution had closed its
case counsel for defendant moved for an
instruction to acquit upon the theory, as
stated, that Haskell was not an embezzler.
The jury was ordered out, but the jurymen
did not agree. They refused to acquit
upon the instruction of the court and they
were finally taken back into court to listen
to the testimony of thÂ« defense. The case
will, therefore, continue to-day.

Two Birthdays That Occur on Wash
ington's Birthday.
On the occasion of their anniversary,
which occurred on Washington's birthday,
Raphael Brothers, the Kearny-street
clothiers, received the photograph of a
wee morsel of humanity who, it happens,
was born on the same day as the father of
her country, and with the picture was a
letter from the father of the little beauty.
Alice Martha Sage is the name of the lat
ter.
Alice is a native daughter, born at Mo
desto, Stanislaus County, in 1892, but lives
now with her parents at Pacheco, Contra
Costa County. Little Alice sends her
greetings to Raphael's and wishes, very
naively, both herself and the clothiers,
"lots of happy birthdays." She sends her
picture for good luck, and the recipients of
it prize both it and the ingeniously worded
epistle accompanying it very highly.
HALE & NORCROSS FIGHT
Efforts of Jeremiah Lynch to
Rally the Stock
holders.
Denial That He Has Made an Alli
ance With Robert F.
Morrow.
The contest which Jeremiah Lynch is
making to wrest the control of the Hale
.t Norcross mine from the present board i
of directors is receiving marked attention
in mining circles. He avers distinctly
â¦hat it is not his purpose to close down the
mine if he gets control, but on the other
hand he does propose to introduce meth
ods of reform and economy in the man
agement. He says, however, that the
mine had better be closed than kept run
ning under what he callÃ "the waste and
extravagance of the present board."
In an interview last evening Mr. Lynch
said:
"Since my recent visit to Virginia City
-I am convinced that the mine can be I
worked profitably to the stockholders.
Vet, when I consider that since the first
decision of the Superior Court was ren
dered four years ago the sum of $300,000
has been taken from stockholders in as
sessments, and in addition to that $100,000 1
has been squandered, I cannot be blamed !
for saying that it would be better to close
â¢iown than continue running under such
waste arid extravagance."
"They take out an average of four tons a
Uay, and here and in Virginia City thirty
;>eople are employed, all of whom live like
vampires on the stockholders."
Mr. Lynch was asked what success he
had met with so far in his efforts to get
the support of stockholders for a change of
management, and his reply was:
"There is every prospect that I will con
trol a vast majority of the stock before the
day of election. Stockholders are coming
to my office every day giving offers of sup
port. No, I cannot tell you now how
many shares of the stock we control, but
we will get enough, and no mistake. The
chief objection, I rind, comes from the
directors. Of the seven directors six of
them do not own more than rive shares
apiece. They have no more interest in
the mine than a Congo African. Of
course, they want to keep themselves in
office, and nourish of the expense of stock
holders.
"They have circulated the absurd rumor,"
continued Mr. Lynch, "that I have made
an alliance with Robert F. Morrow to get
control of Hale <fc Norcross. Now, I want
to affirm distinctly that I have not maue i
an alliance with Mr. Morrow or with any
other person who does not own stock. I
rely for support in this contest on stock
holders who are weary of paying assess
ments to perpetuate a career of waste and
mismanagement. Since seeing the mine I
am convinced that there should be no as
sessment this year, and that raining ope
i rations should not be suspended. In Jan
' vary of this year the present board ex-
I pended $7000. The work performed could
j have been done lor $4000."
Mr. Lynch mentioned that there was
I rich ore in the north end of the mine
; which could be worked to the profit of the
Stockholders, but. he said, it did not
i serve the purpose of the present directory
to work it.
In the Superior Court, when Judge Heb
; bard found that $750,000 should be re
turned to Hale & Norcross, he based his
I estimates on car samples attesting the
', value of the ore. The Supreme Court in
dicated that a battery sample would have
been a better or fairer test of the ore value.
j It is cited as a significant fact that Super
j intendentÃyan subsequently testified that
! after a battery clean-up had been made,
showing $26 to the ton, there was found in
the mortar additional gold which brought
thfl value up to $39 per ton.
From this it appears to Mr. Lynch that
the car sample is really the fairer test of
the two. No one, he avers, can approxi
mate how much gold t.ha mortars had
withheld in the Comstock. The mills
have always been paying on the battery
sample, when much of the gold was not
then shpwn.
The principal value of Hale Â«fe Norcross
to-day is the legal assets. The sum of
$1,000,000 is due the stockholders, and Mr.
Lynch is confident that it will be paid.
The proper method to pursue, in the judg
ment of Mr. Lynch, is to run the mine
economically, cut off high-salaried vam
pires and get an honest return for money
I expended.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1896.
A FUN TO ROB
THE TREASURY
Why Custodian Widber
Bought Murderous
Weapons.
MONDAY NEXT THE TIME
Sawed-Off Shotguns and Big
Navy Revolvers Are Now
Handy.
FOREWARNED AND FOREARMED
A Timely Hint That Put the Police
on the Alertâ Plan of the
Situation.
In consequence of a warning recently re
ceived by Treasurer Widber, the custodian
of the public funds, the interior of the City
treasury now presents almost the appear-
â¢ THE ADVANCE OF THE STUDENTS UPON THE CAMPUS.
ance of an armory, and the bank-robbers
who attempt a raid there will meet with a
reception that will be the reverse of peace
able.
Heavy sawed-off shotguns, such as are
used by express-messengers and treasure
guards, all capable of throwing murder
ous ciiargeÃ of buckshot, stand behind the
counters in places where they come per
fectly handy to the clerks, but are invisi
ble to those outside, while navy revolvers
of the latest pattern and carrying heavy
rifle cartridges are equally available on all
sides. All are fully loaded and ready for
an emergency, which, while it is hoped
will not arise, has been fully prepared for.
Shortly after the daring robbery of the
Market-street Savings Bank, when the
highwaymen succeeded in getting away
with $3600, and whicn warned the police
that a desperate gang of bank thieves had
begun operations in this City, an intima
tion was received that Buspicious-looking
characters had been seen spying about the
City treasury.
Not long "after, through one of those
mysterious sources which is such a puzzle
to the average man, information was re
ceived that ao attempt would be made to
loot the treasury and carry away the con
tents of some of the many trays of shining
j gold which can be seen through the nar
row windows whore the cashier holds
' forth.
Information of this kind seldom comes
to the authorities first hand, but often
filters through a dozen mouths before it
reaches the ears that are ever eager for
such matters, and then the silent, unassum
ing looking men of the detective force be
gin to trace the stories through their
devious windings until they are shown to
have foundation or to be meie rumors.
How the story of the contemplated raid
on the treasury finally reached the police
will perhaps never be known, but it did
come to them, and within one hour trusted
men were quietly at work on the case.
That the detectives found cood grounds
for a belief that the desperadoes were con
templating a raid is evidenced by the
prompt action of Treasurer Widber in
preparing to give them a warm reception.
Within a day or two of the time when the
warning was received he visited the estab
lishment of R. Liddle & Co., the Mont
gomery-street gun dealers, and purchased
a small arsenal.
He first picked out two 10-gauge shot
guns of modern pattern. These weapons
are capable, with a charge of five drams
of powder and an ounce and a half of
buckshot, of tearing a human body in a
irightful manner at any distance up to
thirty yards. The charge would be calcu
lated to kill at even three times that dist
ance, and not only are these guns cruel
weapons but they are handy and wonder
fully accurate. Next Mr. Widber picked
out live revolvers, four of 38 cajiber and
one of 41. The latter is fully as effective
as a rifle at short distances, and the others
are handy weapons for close range fight
ing. Cartridges, holsters and other acces
sories made up the array that was at once
installed in the treasury.
The details obtained" by the officers of
i would naturally follow a fusillade of pistol
the law were necessarily meager, for the
trail they were following stopped before it
reached the robbers, but the impression
â¢was gained that the attempt would be
made on Monday next. Color was sriven
to the theory that the day mentioned
would be selected from the" fact that on
that date the second installment of taxes
for the current year is due and the corri
dors in the vicinity of the treasury would
be crowded with tax- payers.
; Escape would be easy in the panic which
I shots in the treasury. If no conflict oc
| enrred it would be easy for the robbers to
j step out into the crowd and slip away be
fore the alarm pould be given.
The location of the treasury is singularly
favorable to such an attempt. Within
sight of its doors and only a few feet away
are three exits, two to the streets and one
to the basement of the hall, while the
main corridor of the hall with exits at
either end is but a few steps away. The
stairway to the basement, with its dark,
damp corridors and labyrinth of pas
sages, is almost directly opposite the doors
of the treasury and could easily be reached
by an active ma-n in live seconds. Once in
the basement any one of a half dozen
exits could be used before the alarm could
be given. Almost equally available is the
â¢ most easterly McAliister-street entrance,
while to the south Park avenue could be
reached within a few seconds. Any of
these three exits would appeal most
strongly to men who had carefully studied
the matter.
Inside the treasury the situation is
hardly less favorable." Along the entire
length of the counter a screen of wood and
glass with curtains inside prevents those
outside from seeing what is going on be
hind the counter, but as it is not three feet
in height it would form no obstacle to a
daring robber, who could place his hands
on its top step on the edge of the counter,
where a ledge several inches in width was
Jeft, and raise himself to a position where
;.a revolver would command the entire
; -office. The coin trays would be within ten
feet of him.
Had not th : Treasurer been forewarned
and forearmed the chances of failure
would not have been greater than those
taken by the robbers who loottd the Mar
ket-street establishment.
The proceeds of success would have been
great, for each day when the vaults are
opened heavy trays of golden eagles,
double and half eagles are carried out and
placed within reach of the cashier's hands.
These aggregaxe many thousands of dol
lars, the total in the treasury being more
than a million dollars, and the loot would
only be limited by the ability of the rob
bers to carry their burdens.
THE RAILROAD SCORED.
Wells, Fargo & Co. >.-ivh It Has Been
Overcharged.
At a meeting of the Harbor Commission
ers yesterday It. R. Swain, the new archi
tect, filed his bond and the contract was
signed by the Commissioners. Swain's
bondsmen for the faithful building of the
new ferry depot are the members of the
American Surety Company of New York.
E. Mason Cooper and Henry W. Titus of
Wells, Fargo <fc Co. appeared before the
board in regard to the charges made by
the Southern Pacific Railroad ior the
accommodation given the express com
pany. Mr. Cooper said plainly that the
railroad was charging them tolls on more
goods than they shipped. "I have looked
into the matter," said Commissioner Cole,
"and I have come to the conclusion that
the Southern Pacific 'is charging $125 for
goods that should not have aggregated
more than $70 or $80 in tolls."
After Mr. Titus had explained that
they were paying rent, to the commission
for space and also had to pay tolls to the
railroad the Commissioners decided to
take the matter under advisement. Presi
dent Colnon, however, told Messrs.
Cooper and Titus that tlie matter of tolls
would have to be arranged by themselves
with the Southern Pacific, but that for the
space occupied by Wells-Fargo charges
would be regulated so as to give exact jus
tice to all.
The Boulder Creek Labor Exchange
wrote asking the board to do all in its
power to promote a free fruit market.
The secretary was told to reply that the
commission had set apart section 4 of the
seawall for a fruit market and that as soon
as the fruit men got together and formed
an organization the baurd would all in its
power to assist them.
Cotton Bros.' bill for $2100 for work on
Howard-street wuarf was allowed.
An electric storm at sea is one of the
alarming experiences to which Â» mariner
is exposed, but, as a matter of record, it is
one that is least fruitful in disastrous re
sults. As a rule, few precautions are
taken to guard against a stroke of light
nine, especially in the merchant service.
Rear-Admiral Dale, commander of the
Britis i flying squadron, first saw active
service at the capture of the Peiho forts,
in the Chinese war of 1858. It is said that
his superiors look upon him as a man who
may be depended upon to do nothir g rash
or inconsiderate.
"BAH FOR REINSTEIN!"
State University Students at
Work on Their Campus
Yesterday.
THE PICK-AND-SHOVEL BRIGADE
An Exciting "Cane Rush" for the
Possession of a Broken Shovel-
Handle.
"Rah! rah! s-h-o-v-e-l! Rah, for Rein
stein! Where's me pick?"
These were some of the variety of yells
heard on the uiiiversity campus yesterday
afternoon when the entire corps of stu
dents lined up for a "dirt rush," as they
called it. Eegent Reinstein looked over
his noisy army of laborers, then at the
carts, wheelbarrows and other grading im
plements and wondered if the Varsity
athletes would tackle the banks of
earth to be moved as they would have
tackled a Stanford team on the foot
ball field. He had called upon
them to expend some surplus mus
cular energy upon improving the grounds
and they had lesponded four or five
hundred strong. But Falstaff never
looked over so motely an array as greeted
the regent's eye. Each young fellow had
ransacked closet, garret, basement, wood-
shed and even the dreary precincts of the
"old clo' man" for a suitable and odd cos
tume for the occasion.
The old battered plug hats, bearing the
dents of hard-fought rushes, tattered ten
nis suits and even the overalls and jumper
of the legitimate laborer were brought out
for this extraordinary occasion. There
were recitations in the forenoon, but many
of them were cut short, so anxious were
the members of the classes to get into
their "labor-day" regimentals.
Many ot the students provided them
selves with short clay pipes, which they
inverted between their teeth as they plied
pick and shovel, as the proper thing for
wurkin' on the grade."
A few sweet "co-eds" ventured out to
look at their Varsity brothers, but the ap
pearance of that burlesque battalion was
not imposing in its beauty. They were
wise in their generation when they de
clined to provide luncheon tor that gang.
Dainty sandwiches and foamy coffee
handed around by lovely scholastic wait
resses would have been out of place in that
mob.- Beans and bacon and flapjacks
would have been a fitting fare for them, so
they themselves said, and they were proud
oi their rough exteriors.
Captain Ransome of the Varsity foot
ball team appointed himself the chief of
the crowbar gang, and during the day
drilled deep holea in the glbbe to encour
age his squad in prying bowlders out of
their primal bed. He had an able coad
jutor in ex-Captain Sherman, whose
knowledge of geology made him valuable
in the rock-lifting line.
Wittenmeyer, also of the football team,
was the big king of spades, and his gang
of shovelers went at tte banks of earth
like the Light Brigade against the Russian
batteries at Balaklava. Fred Koch, cap
tain of the track athletics, was cliief of the
department of repairs, an) was most active
in seeing that none of the wheelbarrows
were broken by the too enthusiastic work
men.
Clay Gooding, a prize haseballist, drove
a dump-cart with the skill of a Grecian
charioteer in the Olympian games. He
was gotten up in a pair of duck trousers,
a fuzzy Dan McCarthy white hat and a
tennis jacket that was louder than a col
lege yell.
Editor Hirst of the Daily Berkeleyan
was chief of the engineers and pointed
out grades to the workmen. Lieutenant
Mcc of the University Battalion emptied,
the dump-carts, and Captain Johnson of
the baseball team instructed him in his
duties. Brick Morse, one of the musical
prodigies of the Glee Club, was the Hebe
of tlie day and passed around the water
bucKet with unflagging zeal. Walter
Magee was the jehu of cart No. 1, with
Editor Fisher of the University Magazine
as hi 3 understudy. Athlete Dorn of ham
mer-throwing fame was the boss of the
barrows.
At 1 o'clock the battalion, headed by
the band playing the "Honeymoon
March," tramped down to the scene of
their labors, where Superintendent Mc-
Laren of Golden Gate Park had the picks,
shovels, barrows and carts awaiting them.
To get their hands in the classes immedi
ately improvised a number of exciting
wheelborrow iaces. Then President Friend
of the Association of Students addressed
the squads drawn up under their respec
tive officers. He told them in stirring
words that from the tops of yonder coast
range twice forty fenturies were looking
down at them. The eyes of the Republic,
of Stanford, of Linuokalani, of the com
ing Legislature, of Salisbury ana of the
Transvaal were on them.
He concluded his effort when a Cicer
oian clod of earth struck him between
the shoulders and the students sailed in.
The dirt flew. One gang worked oa the
main road-leading across the campus and
the larger company shoveled into the un
even ground in front of the north build
ing. Some of the soil there is exceedingly
rocky and the young fellows soon found
that working on the grade is not play.
But they stuck industriously to their job
and their shovels began to make a show
ing. The unusual spectacle of the stu
dents doing real old-fashioned work on
their campus attracted a large number of
visitors, who were as amused at the gro
tesque costumes of the laborers as at the
gravity of their manners.
President Kellogg, Regent Reinstein and
Professors Soule and Randall made their
rounds among the laborers, and the class
in civil engineering took grade sights
around the grounds. Lieutenant-Colonel
Bush, the brand-new officer on the staff of
Governor Budd, in brown jumper and
overalls, looked anything but military
among the dump carts and wheelbarrows.
At 4 o'clock the bugle sounded the "re
treat," and work stopped for the day.
However, the laborers were not quite-satis
fied with their exertions. A freshman was
seen walking across the campus with a
broken shovel handle in his hand. The
cry of "a freshman with a cane!" was
raised, and a score of sophomores pounced
upon him.
His class in turn charged down to his
rescue, and soon the hottest kind of a
''cane rush 1 ' was in evidence. The two
rival classes tugged and tackled and fought
for that shovel like savages. Other classes
formed flying wedges and flung themselves
into the mass of struggling students with
irresistible force. Regent Reinstein, fear
ing that some one would be injured as the
young feilows rolled and floundered over
their prize, tried tire power of the regency
upon the boys and endeavored to get the
broken shovel away from them ; but a
flying wedge struck him and he was lost in
the confusion. Finally the "rush" ended,
and the first "labor day" at the State Uni
versity was over.
To-day and to-morrow the work will go
on,.unless the threatening rainstorm makes
labor impossible.
THE CASE COMPROMISED
Paderewski's Secretary Acknowl
edges an Old Debt and
Squares Accounts.
The Action of J. S. Reid Against
Hugo Gorlitz Settled Satisfac-
torily to All Parties.
The case of J. S. Reid agajnst Huco Gor
litz, which was on trial before Justices
Barry and Kerrigan, has been settled sat
isfactorily to all parties. The action was
on an assigned claim of G. Verdier & Cc,
proprietors of the "City of Paris" store.
It was claimed that this firm gave credit
to Mr. Gorlitz some seventeen years ago
for certain dresses and otiier material to
be used in the production of '"Pinafor","
in which opera the wife of Mr. Gorlitz
took part.
Mr. Gorlitz, being obliged to- leave the
State about that time in the pursuit of his
business, dd not have an opportunity to
settle the bill until ii is recent arrival here
as the secretary of the great Paderewski.
A question of law was presented as to
whether this old account bore interest and
the suit, which was yesterday dismissed,
was the result. At the trial of the case
the defense was that the goods had been
furnished at the request of Fred .Lister,
the manager of the '"rinafore" opera, and
that he, not Mr. Gorlitz, was liable for the
bill. The memories of the witnesses were
not of the best after the lapse of seventeen
years, but the production of several letters
of Mr. Gorlitz, in which he recognized the
debt as his own and promised to adjust it,
recalled the old transacti6n and presented
the case in a new lignt to the defendant.
In a spirit of fairness and with a desire
to do full justice to a firm lhat had treated
him kindly Mr. Gorlitz made overtures
after tiie case had been tried and submit
ted to Day the principal in full, and also
offered to pay a portion of the accrued in
terest.
Messrs. Verdier & Co. promptly ac
cepted the ofFer and the annoying litiga
tion ended. "While on the witness-stand
Mr. Gorlitz testified that he had always
been treated with the utmost fairness by
the "City of Paris," and that put at rest
any rumor of harsh treatment suffered by
him at the hands of the proprietors.- He
said that he still entertained for the firm
the highest respect, and Mr. Fusenot of
the "City of Paris" expressed himself as
entirely satisfied with the settlement.
The incident closed with the best of feel
ing on the part of the principals and their
attorneys.
Mrs. Dimmick, who is to wed General
Harrison, married Walter Dimmick, a
brilliant young lawyer, fifteen years ago.
He died while they were on their wedding
tour. For eight years she wore mourning
for him.

HONOR TO ITALIAN DEAD.
Requiem Mass in Memory of
Soldiers Who Fell in
Africa.
CATAFALQUE UNDER THE FLAG
The Officers of the Colombo Were
Present and Crowds Filled
the Church.
The Italian church on Dupont street
was crowded yesterday morning at the
solemn requiem mass in memory of the
Italian soldiers who feil at Amba Ala^'i, in
Abyssinia, righting for their country.
So great was the crush that those who
could not obtain seats stood in the rear of
the church, and when no more standing
room was to be found people stationed
themseJves on the steps leading to the
building.
No special decorations had been pre
pared in the church. On the main door of
the building was an inscription stating
that the Italians of San Francisco prayed
to the God of armies for the peace and
eternal repose of their departed brethren
who fell like heroes for their country and
for civilization at Anvba Alagi.
Near the high altar was a catafalque
surrounded by candles and adorned with
the Italian flag.
Professor Spadina directed the musical
part of the mass, which was by Decia
Monti. Miss Adele Kottanzi and William
Ladd sang the solos, and Signor Rossa
Laraja, the violinist, played some of the
instrumental parts. Mrs. L. Siefani, Mrs.
Spadina, MissW. Spadina, Miss Catherine
Daneri. Miss Gleason and other violinists
also assisted.
Among those present at the mass were
Commander Bertolino' of the Colombo,
Lieutenant -Commander Presbitero, Cay.
Freigerio, Dr. Belli, Lieutenants Resio and
De Filippi, and Second Lieutenants
Shashek, Winspeare, Frenzi and Ayme
rich, all in full-dress uniform. A com
pany of marines was also detailed to at
tend.
There were also present: Consul Bruni
Grimalda, Cay. Calegaris, J. F. Fugazi and
Drs. Caglieri, Vaccari, Ollino and Barsotti.
Father de Carohs officiated.
By 11 o'clock the mass was finished and
the officers adjourned to the house of Cay.
Calegaris, where they lunched.
Mr. Baring-Gould thinKs out many of
his plots lying in bed. The foundations of
more than one story have been developed
in a single sleepless night. He makes no
notes except a brief sketch of each chapter.
