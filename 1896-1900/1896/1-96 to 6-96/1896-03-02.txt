Old Glory Dragged Through the Streets
of the Cityâ Spaniards Eager
for War.
MADRID, Spain, March I.â Dispatches
from Barcelona state that an attack has
been made upon the United States con
sulate in that city, notwithstanding the
fact that the building was guarded.
J During the day a procession comprising
10,000 persons, headed by four republican
members of the Chamber of Deputies, pa
raded through the principal streets of the
city as a demonstration against the action
of the American Senate. A strong guard
had been placed about the American con
sulate in anticipation of tronble. As the
procession passed it there was some de
risive cries and cat calls. The mob tried
to force their way into the building, but
the police and gendarmes succeeded in
driving them away, but not until they had
been forced to charge upon the mob with
drawn sabers.
While this trouble was going on. the
main body of the procession continued its
march to the town hall, where the leaders
of the demonstration handed to the Mayor
a strongly worded . protest against the
action of the American Senate and also
against the speeches that had been deliv
ered therein on the Cuban ques ion, it be
ing declared that some of the speakers had
grossly insulted Spain and the Spanish
Government in defending Cuban bandits
and outlaws. ......
Subsequently a great crowd assembled
in the Plaza Cataiuna, and a number- of
patriotic- speeches were delivered. The
crowd became greatly excited the burn
ing oratory of the speakers, and after the
meeting had broken up a large number of
those who had listened to the words glori
fying Spain and denouncing the United
States proceeded to the American con
sulate^ where they gave vent to their patri
otism by stoning the building, much to
the damage. of windows. thereof.
â¢As in the previous mob demonstrations
in Barcelona the police were almost im
potent to disperse the rioters who did about
as they pleased.
In the evening there was. another out
burst of disapproval of the United States
and all things American. This time it
took the form of publicly dishonoring
the American flag.
The rioters had purchased somewhere a
large. American flag which, after it had
been dragged through the streets, was
pulled to pieces amid cries of "Long live
Spain" and "Down with the Americans."
There is still much excitement in. the city.
â  After this outrage on the American flag
the mob became more violent and a propo
sition to make a further demonstration
against the American consulate was speed
ily acted upon. The mob proceeded to
the consulate, in the meantime arming
themselves with stones. Arriving at the
consulate a perfect volley of missiles was
directed against the shield over the door
way bearing the American coat of arms,
which was battered almost to pieces. The
mob in some way became possessed of
several American flags, which were de
stroyed amid ribald jeers and expressions
of contempt for the Nation they repre
sented.
Trie situation was becoming more and
more threatening, when re-enforcements
for the guards at the consulate arrived in
the shape of a detachment of mounted
gendarmes. The crowd was ordered to
dsiperae, which it sullenly refused to do,
whereupon the gendarmes charged them
with drawn swords and put them to flight.
Several of the rioters were injured by be
ing trampled on.
Until a late hour the boulevards were
thronged by an excited crowd singing the
"Marseillaise" and patriotic Spanish
songs. .
Popular feeling at the capital is bitter
against The. United States. As stated in
: the United Press dispatches last night, the
.stock market here yesterday responded to
the excitement and there was a material
.; decline in purely Spanish and Cuban se
curities. In view of the financial difficul
ties under which the Government is labor
ing this is a most unfortunate time for
Spanish securities to. decline in value.
-. The action of Admiral Berenger, Minis
ter of Marine, in ordering the speedy pre
paration of six warships and some of the
naval reserve vessels of the Spanish Trans
â¢ atlantic Company for dispatch to the Ba
hama Channel meets with hearty approval.
It is very evident that, despite Prime Min
ister Canovas dcs Castillo's declaration
yesterday that if President Cleveland
should be compelled to indorse the action
of Congress it would not provoke' an inter
."national conflict nor interrupt the friendly
relations existing between - Spain and the
- United States, the Government is doing its
Utmost to prepare against any possible
The San Francisco Call.
contingency. The Prime Minister said
last evening:
"1 trust that President Cleveland will
veto the formal resolution of Congress,
and I have more reason to trust that;ne will
not comply with the resolutions contained
therein.' 1 .
-He added: "The granting of belligerent
rights to the Cuban rebels is not a casus
belli, but Spain shall declare that it is not
the act of a friendly nation. I do not
think that Spain is threatened by foreign
aggression, but measures shall be taken
for the defense of Spanish rights, chiefly
in Cuba. As regards demonstrations in
the streets here, I shall repress them se
verely."
Senor Silvela, leader of the dissident con- "â â 
servatives, has, in an interview, advised
the union of all Spaniards without regard
to their political faith. He added that the
act of the American Senate was without
precedent in international law. He greatly
feared, considering the bad faith of the
Americans, that they gave belligerent
rights a different meaning than is de
scribed in international law.
An interview was also sought with Senor
Castelar, the Republican leader, but he re
fused to speak on the subject, as he con
sidered the circumstances to be of the
most serious nature.
Senor Eduaon, Minister of Foreign
Affairs, has sent a long cable dispatch
to Senor Dupuy de Lome, Spanish Embas
sador to Washington, instructing him to
present to the. American Government
a formal protest against the insult
offered to Spain in speeches delivered in
the Senate during the discussion of the
belligerency resolution.
At several o' he cafes here last night
bands played patriotic airs, which evoked
much cheering and enthusiasm. Occa
sionally cries could be heard against
America and the Americans.
The troops are confined to their barracks
in readiness to respond to any call for their
services. . .
This morning the city was quiet, but the
public buildings, the American legation
and the residence of Minister Taylor were
guarded, the authorities fearing that in
the present state of public excitement an
attack might be made upon them. A
group of fifty students paraded this morn
ing. They were perfectly orderly and
no attempt was made to interfere with
them. At the university the students this
afternoon attempted to make a demonstra
tion, but the police, having in mind the
last troubles they had with these young
men, promptly intervened and dispersed
them.
Acting under instructions from the Gov
ernment no group of persons is allowed to
approach the United States legation or the
house occupied by Minister Taylor.
' In addition to the warships Fetayo, Viz
caya, Oyuendd, Miria " Teresa", pari to
and Alfonso XIII, the Ministry of Marine
has ordered that several torpedo-boats and.
one torpedo-catcher be made ready for im
mediate dispatch in the event of the United
States acknowledging the Cubans as bel
ligerents.
Admiral Beranger has ordered that the
training squadron also be field in readi
ness for service. Its probable objective
point is Cuba. Fifty merchant vessels
will receive armaments and will be used
as transports or cruisers should the neces
sity arise. Several captains in the mer
chant service have offered to arm their
vessels and turn them into privateers in
the event of war.
A capitalist in Barcelona has informed
the Government that if he be granted let
ters of marque he will fit out and main
tain â¢at his own cost a swift steamer to
prey upon the maritime commerce of the
United States. S@BsÃ
Minister Taylor was expected last night
to attend the opera, where he has a box.
He did not go, however, as be learned that
a hostile demonstration had been prepared
for him, and he thought it best to not add
fuel to the flame that is now burning so
brightly against the country he represents.
There is a general feeling that Spain
must do something to avenge what she
considers an insult to her honor, but it is
thought that the Government is too cool
headed to be carried away by popular
clamor. It will take all the steps it deems
right and expedient to protect Spain's
interests, but will do nothing to provoke a
war with the United States.
Tne Prime Minister has announced that
the Government has sufficient resources to
conduct the war in Cuba until the end of
May, when it will ask the Cortes to grant
a further credit. /
The Imparcial (independent) to-day ad
vises prudence and exhorts the ministry to
await events. It says:
- "If matters reach the conclusion the
Americans desire the whole of Spain will
rise against the United States. Neither in
the Mediterranean, whose entrance we
command, nor or on the Atlantic will a
single American ship be safe, for we shall
organize privateers on a large scale.- We
must not make a noisy demonstration,
like the Portuguese at the time of their
dispute with Great Britain. We conquered
Napoleon by a system of guerrilla war
fare, and we shall establish a system of
privateers that will conquer a mercantile
nation on the sea. The Americans are
willing to judge Spain by her finances.
There are considerations superior to the
revenues of the country."
This article is illustrative of the popular
feeling. There is no doubtâ at least no
expressed doubtâ of the perfect ability of
Spain to whip the United States, the re
sources of which are not in the least under
stood by tne people generally of this coun
try. : X, â¢; .. 'â>
In addition to some of the students here
a number of roughs and some Republicans
attempted to make a demonstration! They
rapidly traversed the streets from the
University to the Puerta del Sol and
thence to the bull ring shouting "Down
with the United States" and "Long live
Spain." BBOBBBHSB
The movement was promptly checked
by the authorities. A .majority ; of the
students and -the inhabitants of the city
held aloof. '
.. The Ministers are preparing to further
call men to serve with the colors. Â» An or
der has been given by the Government for
100,000 Mauser rifles, the weapons to be de
livered immediately. ; : ;. .. ..

SUMMONED TO ARMS.
Spain's Army Reserve to Be Called
Into Readiness.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 2. -A special
cable dispatch to the Sun from London
says: Spain has interpreted Friday's de
bate and vote in the United States Senate
as a threat of war.
The Spanish Government so understands
it, but the Spanish people have united in a
great national insult to the United States.
The press throughout trie country de
nounces the action of the American Sen
ate in the strongest terms. Many papers
are clamoring for war against the republic.
The most- significant feature of yester
day's and to-day's: uprisings is the fact
that the Republicans, who' are now a very
strong party in Spain, took as 'active a
part .as -any.- The : ' Republican party's
policy regarding Cuba has been in favor of
stopping the war and granting Cuba home
rule. : .â. ;-, . < - ; .- - â 
The mob at Barcelona was led by four
leading Republicans. It is evident, there
fore, that the attitude of the United States
is resented by Spain.
4:30 a. m. â The dispatches since mid
night indicate that the Government will
at once issue a call summoning trie army
reserves to arms.
All accounts agree that the demonstra
tion showed far greater popular feeling
against the United States than has ever
been manifested in favor of the subjuga
tion of the rebellion in Cuba.
The tone of the comments of the London
newspapers this morning is the same as it
has been for a month past. They are un
able to condemn the United States, espe
cially if it acts on the ground of humanity.
But their sympathy, is with Spain.
Most of the writers admit that there is
grave reason to believe that General Wey
ler's policy has been cruel, inhuman r and
indefensible. All warn Spain of the hope
lessness of a war with trie United States.
!-' The Daily Chronicle is the least preju
[ diced of the London' papers, most of which
are unable to disguise their fears that
Cuba is about to fall into the hands of the
United States. The Chronicle says: â¢
"That the United States consulate at
Barcelona was stoned by a mob is scarcely
a factor in the international situation,
seeing that the police did their best to
save it. v . ;
"But Spain may have learned wisdom
about Cuba through these repeated
troubles, and she cannot afford to hold out
forever against the public opinion of the
Western world. She must remember what
she lost by too rigid adherence to mere
rights of occupation.
"Cuba is one of the few relics of her
once grand empire of the West. Will she
throw that away too, through mere nar
row-mindedness?
- "If it comes to a naval struggle the
United States will simply wipe Spain off
the seas." ' â  . â â¢
The Telegraph significantly calls atten
tion to the fact that General Weyler is ; a
German as much as to say that this ac
counts for his cruelties.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March I.â There
is so general a demand for action on the

eralMild Tone of the
Press.
[From a Staff Correspondent of the United Press.]
HAVANA, Cuba, March I.â There has
been absolutely no outward demonstration
of feeling against. Americans here. The
city is remarkably quiet to-day.
The Marquis de Palmerola, secretary to
the Governor-General, speaking for the
Government, said that no manifestation
would be permitted. ; The authorities were
prepared to check any disturbance. They
would follow the example of . the central
Government, arid would prevent any gath
ering of the people to protest against the
action of the American Senate should such
a gathering be attempted.
The Marquis further said that, after the
action of the Senate upon the belligerency
question and the meaning of belligerent
rights were perfectly understood, it would
be seen that there: was nothing" to affect
the present friendly ;" relations between
Spain and the United States. Strict neu
trality for the present would be main
tained. ' ' :! "^;
The Marquis deplored the publication in
the United States of reports attributing
atrocities to Captain-General Weyler. He
declared that such reports were false, and
added that their use in the debate in the
Senate had a bad effect. '
Instead of being harsh in his treatment
of political prisoners General Weyler re
quired that absolute proof of their guilt
be furnished before they were deported. ","â¢'
The editorials in the Havana papers on
the action of the Senate are couched in
mild tones. The full text of the resolution
has not been published. 'The papers assure
their readers that there is no' probability
of President Cleveland' signing it, even if
it is approved by the House of Repre
sentatives. . ': J. Frank Clark: ,

precautionary measure against any possi
ble outbreak of violence arising from the
excited feeling of the people of Madrid in
regard to the reported action of the United
States Senate on Cuban affairs, has taken
measures to guard the United States lega
tion. The Spanish newspapers have pub
lished only carefully worded abstracts of
the purport of the Seriate resolutions, but
publications ' in Paris and elsewhere have
given a sufficiently full statement of the
feelings of the United States Congress in
the matter to cause anxiety arid precau
tion.; ' 'â¢**':â¢- .â ...-,.;/,
It is recalled that twice previously for
eign legations have been attacked in Mad
rid. In 1871- the residence of the Papal
nuncio was assailed,' and in 1885 the Ger
man legation was attacked ; on account of
the Caroline Islands dispute. â  >.2." : ; '
|It is : a â¢â¢matter' of history that a good
many years ago the Spanish Consulate in
New Orleans' was attacked sby a mob and
the United States made prompt apology
and reparation to Spain for this insult to
its flag.' It is ; to prevent any such occur
rence against the United States in Madrid
that the precautions of the Spanish Gov
ernment have been taken.
Minister Hannis ; Taylor, though devot
ing most of his time to historical studies
and taking, little part in the diplomatic
life of the Spanish capital, except so far as
urgent business compels him, is not per
sonally unpopular in Madrid. The course
taken by the Spanish Ministry in placing
a guard over the United States legation
has not been adopted at his request, but as
a measure of abundant precaution â â  by the
Spanish Government at > its own instiga
tion, and partly in recognition of the vigi
lance displayed by the United States in the
seizure of the supposed filibustering
steamer Bermuda.
No advices have been received at the
Spanish legation here to indicate any seri
ous danger. Minister de Lome says he has
abiding faith in the good common-sense of
the American people and that he feels cer
tain nothing will happen to interrupt the:
friendly relations existing between Spain
and the Unit6d States. â¢

CAST UP BY THE WAVES.
Body of a Man Who Had Been Brutally
Murdered Found on the Beach
at Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111.. March Upon the
beach of the lake at the foot. of Fifty-first
street, just back of the Chicago Beach
Hotel, was found to-day the body of a
man in a condition which makes it almost
certain that a most brutal and horrible
murder was committed. Early this morn
ing one of the women guests notified the
hotel clerks that on the beach opposite
her window lay a corpse in a nude condi
tion.
The body showed marks of a butchery.!
The head was battered beyond recognition
and bears evidence of having been
chopped with an ax or hatchet. In the
right leg below the knee is a bullet wound,
showing that the man had been shot.
The only ; article of clothes found was a
linen shirt of fine texture, which hung by
the wrists to the body. In the wristbands
were two solid gold sleeve-buttons. The
hands of the murdered man are soft and
unusually small, showing â  that he was not
a manual laborer.
As soon as the discovery was made j the
police were notified and the corpse was re
moved to the Hyde Park Morgue. A
number of detectives have been set to
work to unravel the mystery. The hotel
people say they are quite sure that none
of their guests have met with foul play,
and say the body must have been thrown
into the lake at some other point.

THE NEW YORK FLOATED.

Stranded Liner Gains Deep
Water.
High Tide and a Heavy Swell Aid
in Extricating the Vessel From
Its Position.
. NEW YORK, N. Y. March 1.-The
American line steamer New York, which
went ashore at the Quickstep bell buoy,
near Swinburne Island in the lower bay
during the dense fog which prevailed yes
terday, came off with the assistance of six
tugs at 8:30 o'clock this morning.
Health Officer Doty visited the steamer
to inspect the steerage passengers, While
this inspection was going on the transfer
boat John Moore was receiving the passen
gers to take them to Ellis Island. Before
the inspection was completed the New-
York floated, at 8:30 a. m., and proceeded
up the bay.*
The stevedores worked all night on the
vessel, discharging: 1700 .. pieces of cargo
into three lighters. About 1700 pieces are
still in the steamer's hold. The tugs com
menced work on the vessel at high water
last evening, and succeeded in moving her
about fifty feet, pulling her head out
toward the channel.
This morning, at 7' o'clock, every effort
was made by the tugs, and the New York
worked both screws with all her power.
The New York keeled suddenly to port,
and floated in deep water at 8:30. , The
tide was an unusually high ; one, and the
ship was assisted by the _ heavy easterly
swell which constantly swept in from the
ocean, moving the vessel perceptibly. ', y "/.
â  The New York arrived at her dock at 10
o'clock this morning. She has sustained
no damage whatever, arid will sail on
Wednesday morning. The company at
taches no blame to any one for the acci
dent, and Captain Grant will command
her on her outward voyage.
SISKISG OF THE AILSA.
La Bourgogne's Comthan der Denies That
He Deserted the Wrecked Vessel.
NEW YORK, N.Y., March With a
plate fifteen feet long and four feet wide
upon her 'starboard bow cracked across
from her collision with the Ailsa yester
day the French passeneer steamer La
Bourgo^ne was towed into pier 42, North
River, at 6 o,'clock this morning. Her
cabin arid steerage passengers at once took
shore leave arid the work of repairing the
damage was rushed. / '*
A plate of the same size as the damaged
one has been bolted over the .; crack. This
will give it a double thickness of plating
at this point, which is ; just over the \ col
lision bulkhead. /La Bourgogne will sail
to-morrow morning at 8 o'clock.
Captain Pirrott has nothing to say of the
accident other /than to bitterly deny that
La Bourgogne steamed : away," leaving the
passengers of the Ailsa to their fate with
out an effort? to help them. The screws of
his ship, he says, were reversed and going
at full ; : speed when the collision occurred.
This motion naturally/ tore La Bourgogne
from the gash in the Ailsa's side. The
boats drifted apart and -the fog shut them
from each other's sight. , He did not know
whether or not : the Ailsa was anchored or
proceeding under steam. As soon as pos
sible, ;he said, a whaleboat was lowered
and searched for the missing steamer, but
could not rind her. The hunt was not
abandoned for some time.
,' Thomas H. Barrett, one of the board of
local steamboat inspectors, has inspected
the vessel and says that she is as tight as
a rivet.

NEW YORK, N. V., March 2.-A Jour- â¢.
nal special from Washington says: The .'
Spanish-American situation growing out â '.
of the reports of the riots in Barcelona and .
other cities in Spain was regarded as so :'
serious by the President that he decided
to convene a special meeting of the Cab
i met Sunday night, though the call- was â¢
issued under the guise of a dinner at Sec
retary Olney's. The cable reports of the â 
hostile demonstrations in Spain yesterday â â â 
against the United States created intense
excitement in Washington. '..'..
Secretary Olney was promptly advised .
of the outbreaKs in Madrid, Barcelona and â 
other places in Spain by Minister. Taylor. -
and the American consuls. He hastened,
to the White House and laid before the â 
President all the dispatches he. had .re-: :
ceived. . 'â 'â .'...â â â  ".'-::.' 'â¢
; Secretary Herbert was sent for and con- . ;

--patches of naval vessels to the Gulf â¢ coast :
in the event such a step should become
necessary. The Secretary replied 1 that the
Government has effective ships ready 'for.,
active service sufficient to any purpose of
emergency.
Secretary Olney was directed by the .
President to cable immediately to Minister
Taylor for further details. ; Secretary Ol
ney suggested that the President come to
his residence at 7:30 o'clock for dinner,
and he would invite the members of the
Cabinet to" meet there, and around the
table, the. entire subject could be : trior- i
oughly canvassed. This plan. was carried [
out and the imp brtant conference-took -
place last evening. â 
-' The dinner conference lasted until after =.
10 o'clock. During the "dinner Secretary .
01 ney read a letter from Minister de Lome, â 
the Spanish Minister, inclosing a cable '
message he had received from his Govern
ment. This message directed the Spanish
Minister to inform the United States' Gov- :
ernment that Spain was .exerting all. her
power to amply.protect the United States
legation and consulates, and that he Could' :
give assurances that they would be pro- '
tected from any harm. Also : that. Ameri- ,
cans visiting or residing in. Spain would be.,
made safe from . the attacks of mobs and
other riotous assemblages.
Secretary Olney submitted another com
munication, which created â¢ profound sur
prise. It was a message from the Spanish .
Minister of Foreign Affairs in Madrid, in
sisting that the United States Government -
disavow the action of the Senate as a con- â¢
dition precedent to friendly relations be
tween the two Governments.
Of course, this ultimatum of the Spanish
Minister is regarded as absurd. The. only ,
result of the conference at Secretary Ol
ney's was a . practical . agreement that the
Secretary of State should promptly re
spond in kindly terms to the communica
tion of Minister de : Lome, and through .
him thank his Government . for â¢ its readi
ness to protect Americans and American ,
interests in Spain. The foolish .". demand ,
for a disclaimer of the Senate's resolution

THE KAISER'S LATEST WHIM.
Dissuaded From Sending an Anti-
American Letter to Spain's
Queen Regent.
BERLIN, Germany, March I.â Upon the
resumption of the discussion of the sugar
bill in the Reichstag to-morrow Count yon
Posadowsky-Wehner, Minister of the Im
perial Treasury, will make an announce
ment that the Governments of the South
ern German States and their representa
tives, will offer no opposition to the pro
posed alterations of the law, but on the
contrary, some of them are willing to
support a Pleasure fixing a premium even
higher than that proposed. Bavaria con
tinues to oppose the bill, but the probabili
ties. are that. despite this opposition the
bill will pass.
The emphatic declaration recently made
by . Freiuerr Marschall yon Bieberstein.
Minister of Foreign Affairs, that the Gov
ernment had no intention of making any
increased demands for the purpose of
strengthening the navy have failed to con
vince member* of any political party that
the idea of enlargement of the navy has
been abandoned.
"" It is clearly understood that the Em
peror is determined to obtain an enlarged
naval estimate, and the hope is entertained
â in official quarters that the disclosures in
regard to the British naval plans made by
.George J, Goschen, First Lord of the
British. Admiralty, in his speech at
Lewes, together with his insulting allu
sions. to Germany will so thoroughly ex
cite the indignation and resentment of the
members of. the Reichstag as. to cause
them to grant any increase of naval esti
mates that may be demanded.
. The "Weser Zeitung of Bremen is au
thority for the statement that Altdeutscher
Verein, with the approval of the Emperor
and the highest naval authorities and ex
perts of .the empire, proposes to demand a
vote, of 200.000 t OOO marks for the construc
tion of new warships,' and if the Rfich-
stag refuses to authorize the grant the
Ministry will be dismissed and the Reich
stag dissolved.
In the meantime the heat in the highest
political atmosphere against England is
becoming intensified. In an interview
upon the subject with a representative of
The United Press yesterday a prominent
German diplomat- defined the situation
briefly as follows:
"England," he said, "is rapidly ap
proaching a state in which she must fight
for her position as an empire. Germany
has no ill-feeling toward Great Britain and
has no wish to see her dismembered, but
the other nations now seeking her weak
points everywhere on the globe think the
time has come to square up England's old
accounts. Germany won't initiate the
fight, nor has she any desire to make an
anti-English alliance. On the contrary,
she will stand aloof and let England
demonstrate that she is still entitled to
the supremacy she claims. These may be
tall words,?' said he, "but they echo the
exact opinion of the Emperor and leading
statesmen ; of Germany, who have arrived
at the conclusion that England must soon
prove" that she possesses her supposed
vitality as a great power."
The "arrest of the absconding Berlin law
yer, Fritz Friedmann. in Bordeaux yester
day is now the absorbing, topic of interest
and discussion in Berlin. Friedmann,
alter leaving Berlin, traveled from point
to point through Europe in company with
a Berlin woman of the town, but in spite
of this fact and the other scandalous and
criminal acts of the lawyer the press
treats the couple as though they were the
most reputable persons in the land. Since
his arrest Friedmann has disclosed how he
disposed of the documents compromising
other people which be held in bis posses
sion when, he fled from Berlin. It
transpires that he caused the publication
in Paris of the whole of the scandalous
letters which, figured in the Yon Kotze
scandal some time ago, and caused the
dismissalof the gentleman from the office
of Court Chamberlain. No publisher
would dare to produce the letters in Ger-
many, as they are too disgusting to bear
- reading. Most of the letters are addressed
to the Countess Fritz Hohenau.
The Berlin Government is endeavoring
to arrange some terms upon which the
letters can be bought, as, although the
' statements contained in them are for the
most part untrue, their revelations would
be altogether too overwhelming for society
to withstand. The French police have
" seized the entire Paris edition of the letters
and turned them over to the German em
bassy. For obvious reasons it is not prob
able that Friedmann will be extradited to
Germany. ;- .
It is stated that a firm in Montana has
contracted to ship to Germany 2,500,000
- bushels of barley, and if the venture pays
the men in the deal they will arrange to
ship a much larger consignment of Minne
sota barley.
â¢ The Berlin Nachrichten makes the state
merit that the revised decree in regard to
â¢"'. American insurance companies shows a
clause declaring that all United States
companies will be locked out of Prussia,
unless the German companies are granted
. equal facilities with other companies in the
United States. This implies that New
York State must repeal its recent legisla
tion affecting German companies.
The lack of enterprise characterizing the
German press is shown by the fact that
not a sin le newspaper has a* yet com
mented seriously upon the action of the
" United States Senate in regard to Cuba.
Instead of discussing this, the most.im
portant and interesting topic of the day,
the papers have devoted their space to the
â¢ publication of attacks upon England's mo
nometallic policy.
It is currently reported that the Emperor
in an interview with the Charicellor.Prince
Hohenlohei expressed \ a' desire to send a
communication in regard to the American
Senate's action to the Queen Regent of
Spain, but was dissuaded by tbe Chancel
lor from doing so. No clearly defined
opinion can be obtained as to. how the of
ficial press will be directed to treat the
matter, but the belief is almost general in
Government circles that, a strong pro-
Spanish bias will be assumed. ;
In an article on the*"subject of Â» bimet
allism the Vossische Zeitung asserts that
the want of harmony in the English Cab
inet encouraged the hope that the mone
tary queston would be reopened. Beyond
printing vaguely worded alienations that
George N. Canon, the British Parliament
ary Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and A.
J. Balfour, First Lord of the Ireasury,
have quarreled over the negotiations for a
monetary agreement, the papers concerned
in the debate of the question are all at sea,
but diatribes even upon this matter are
made vehicles for the conveyance of abuse
of England and English politicians. The
Tageblatt, in euphemistic phraseology, in
timates that Balfour is no speaKer of the
truth, and the Vossische Zeitung says that
the English Government has given j Bal
four the. lie, an experience which has not
fallen to the lot of a Minister within the
memory of man. â¢
The Yorwaerts, the Socialist organ,
piints a violent article, which, it is ex
pected, will cause the seizure of the paper
and the prosecution of its editors. The
article accuses the Government of creating
an administration in Germany upon the
procedure and conditions prevailing in
Turkey. The article avoids making a per
sonal criticism of the Kaiser, but covers
its attack upon . him and the Government
generally with insinuations, declaring that
the growth of free life is necessary to
national expansion.
Dr. Carl Peters, the African explorer,
who was recently elected president of the
German Colonial Association, declares that
he has knowledge that England will be
forced to evacuate Egypt within the month
of March. Dr. Peters' petrel, however,
does not always indicate a storm.
The feature of the political and commer
cial situation during the past week has
been an unbroken rise in prices and slow
but sure Bourse and trade movements.
The rumors of war have not touched the
dealings of the Bourse and the trade re
ports are mostly favorable. The monthly
settlement of the Bourse which was con
cluded on Thursday showed the Bourse to
be in the best condition it has experienced
for years. The stock of gold in the Reichs
bank is growing rapidly and the dividends
of the banks and industrial enterprises are
highly satisfactory.
A well-known Baltimore prelate, who
was an intimate friend of the absconding
lawyer, Fritz Friedmann, before his fall,
has offered to support him and to make
an attempt to effect his social redemption.
If Friedmann is released at Bordeaux, as
he likely will be, he will sail at once for
Baltimore.

WORK FOR THE SENATE
Discussion of the Dupont Case,
Involving Title to a Seat
in the Chamber.
Conflict Expected When the Arkansas
Compromise Measure Is Called
Up for Action.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 1.-The
coming week will inaugurate the discus
sion on a question of the highest privilege
in the Senateâ title to a seat in tha body.
Mitchell, chairman of tbe Committee
on Privileges and Elections, gave notice
Friday that he would call the Dupont
case Monday, at 2 o'clock. Mitchell
will make tbe opening speech and will be
followed during the week by Tnrpie of
Indiana for the Democrats and by Pritch
ard of North Carolina for the Republicans.
The chairman is of the opinion that the
debate on this subject will not last longer
than ten days, or at the outside not to ex
ceed two weeks. .
To-morrow there is every probability of
tbe Senate locking horns over a matter
against which there appears to be a very
determined opposition in the Senate. It
is the bill reported by the Senate Commit
tee on Public Lands to approve a compro
mise and settlement between the United
States and Arkansas. Berry sought to
call it up late Friday afternoon and make
it the unfinished business, but several
Senators objected, and upon his motion
being pressed to take it up the absence of
a quorum, forced by the opponents of the
measure, was developed. Berry then gave
notice that he would move to take the bill
up immediately after the morning busi
ness to-morrow. In antagonizing the bill
Friday it was characterized by Gear as "a
bill of a very questionable character, in
volving millions of dollars."
The agricultural bill will be brought up
to-morrow by Mr. Cullom. who has it in
charge. Inasmuch as there has been no
amendments to the legislative features of
this bill as it came from the House, it will
probably be passed in one afternoon.
During the week it is not unlikely that
Mr. Teller of Colorado may make his
promised speech on the tariff-silver ques
tion, in which he will explain the stand
he has taken and reasons for his recent op
position to the tariff bill. Beyond this
there is no programme for the week.

Injuries.

Two Firemen and a Baggageman
Killedâ Roland- Reed's Company
Aboard.
MACON, Ga., March I.â A wreck, cost
ing threa persons their lives and injuring
eight or nine others, occurred at Stone
Creek trestle last night. It was discovered
to-day that several rails had been removed
on the trestle,. which is many feet above
the water, and there is no doubt the acci
dent was caused by train robbers. The
following people were killed : Robert Mer
cer, fireman, of Macon; F. W. Whippier,
baggageman, Macon; John Reddish, fire
man, who died from scalds.
The passenger train had hardly met its
destruction before a freight train coming
along at a good rate of speed reached the
trestle and, striking the structure bared
by the misplaced rails, went into the creek.
The engineer jumpedyin time to save his
life, but Fireman Reddish was killed.
Engineer Joynerof the passenger train
and his fireman, Mercer, did not discover
that the rails had been removed until the
engine jumped the' track. The engine
plunged forward on the trestle and broke
through, falling to the bed of the creek.
The freight train left Macon ten minutes
behind the passenger.
' The wildest excitement prevailed at the
scene of the wreck for two 'â  hours. The
uninjured quickly began the work of
rescue, but two of the crew had been in
stantly killed. Others were picked up
dangerously hurt aiid they were given the
best attention possible.
The railroad officials sent news of the
wreck to Macon and a crew of surgeons
and officials left shortly afterward for the
scene. Several detectives were on board.
That the wreck was the work of train
robbers seems certain. The rail was re
moved from the left-hand track going
south. Mercer, the fireman on the pas-
senger-train, was coaling at the time, and
Engineer Jovner could not see the track.
Conductor Joyner of the passenger-train
quickly sent back one of his men with a
lantern to stop the freight, but it was too
late. Engineer Green of the freight saw
the trainman's lantern and attempted to
bring his train to a stop, bat it plunged in
to the broten space of the track: â¢'â  -i ; > >
Whippier, the baggagemaster, was
drowned in two feet of water in" his car.
The baggage-car tumbled into the creek
and Whippler's body was pinioned down
in the water which rushed into the car.
He was found with his feet in the air and
his head under water.
A coincidence is that the wreck occurred
within one mile of a similar wreck one
year ago, and Roland Reed's . company,
which was in last year's wreck, was also in
last night's accident. Reed and the mem
bers of his company have suits pending
against the road now for $40,000 damages.
None of the actors were seriously hurt
night.
There is strong circumstantial evidence
against three men suspected of removing
the rails, but no arrests have been made.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., March I.âEu
gene V. Debs, President of the American
Railway Union, made an address here to
night at the opera house, before more
than 1000 working people. The speaking
was under the auspices of the Trades
Council of this city which charged 10
cents admittance to defray expenses and
tickets were sold rapidly this afternoon
until Chief of Police T. C. McDonald
stopped the sale and ordered a postpone
ment of the speaking, saying it was
against the law for a lecture on Sunday
and especially when admission fees were
charged.
The word was passed around the town
and in a short while the main streets of
the city were crowded with workmen crit
icizing the action of the Chief of Police.
Great indignation was expressed and a
special meeting of the Police Commis
sioners was hurriedly called. It was, bow
ever, subsequently decided to allow the
speaking to-night.
Shortly after 6 o'clock Debs arrived on
the Central Road. He was met at the
depot by between 400 and 500 people and
carried on the shoulders of strong brawny
men toward the Florence Hotel. He
spoke on "Unionism" at the opera, house.

MURDERS HIS AGED MOTHER.

mits Suicide.
LONG ISLAND CITY. L. 1., March 1.-
Michael Kraemer, 25 years of age, shot
and killed his aged mother and then put a
bullet into his own brain this afternoon.
Death was instantaneous in both cases.
The Kraemer family consisted of the
murdered woman, the suicide and a
younger brother named John. They had
been entertaining a party of friend, from
New York. Plenty of drink was supplied.
Late this -afternoon the party became
hilarious and Michael made frequent trips
back and forth to a near-by saloon. Pre
vious to making the final trip h* had an
altercation with one of the guests from
New York, Andrew Ryper. The quarrel
had not been settled when Michael went
out for more wine. J
Oh his return his mother followed him
into the kitchen. Everybody in the house
professes ignorance as to what transpired
there. They say they were alarmed by
hearing two pistol shots in rapid succes
sion. On rushing into the kitchen they
found mother and son stretched on the
floor a few feet apart gasping for breath.
There was a bullethole under Mrs. Krae
mer's left ear and one near her son's right
eye. In his hand be still held a smoking
revolver. They were both dead before the
police arrived.
HUDSON RIVER ROOMING
Water Submerges the Docks
and Invades Basements
at Troy.
Millions of Feet of Lumber Washed
Awayâ Factory Engines Are
at. a Standstill.
TROY, N. V., March The water lin
the Hudson River reached' the highest
point to-night attained since 1857. At 9
o'clock the mark of the memorable flood
of 1886 on the bridge here was lost sight
of, and the water continues to rise. The
docks are : submerged to the shed roofs.
All the cellars along the river front have
been flooded and much damage done. In
many of the large collar-factories the en
gine-rooms have been invaded and the
fires extinguished.
In the southern part of the city many
houses are submerged to the second story.
On the west side 'the damage is even
greater. Millions of feet of lumber piled
along the entrance of the Erie Canal have
been washed away. The electric light
statfon is flooded ant the. village, of West
Troy is in darkness. The water works en
gines were also stopped, so the paradox is
presented of a flood yet a famine of water.
ALBAXT'S MM VXD A
Cellars Flooded and Surface Fires Ex
tinguished.
ALBANY, N. V.; March Tbe flood at
Albany this evening has attained greater
proportions than any in years excepting
only that of 1883, when the Hudson was
swollen to a height of seventeen feet above
the normal flow. To-night the freshet is
sixteen feet and the water is rising.
The whole southern portion of the city
lying on the flat land for a distance of 200
yards back from the river front is inun
dated, but there is no extensive damage
reported. Cellars of business-bouses are
all flooded, but merchants had sufficient
warning from the Weather Bureau and had
removed their goods.
The water came into the power-house of
the Albany Railroad, .oh South Pearl
street, and an engine from the Fire De
partment had to be brought into service
to pump out the cellars so that the fires
could be kept going in the boilers which
furnished the power for the electric-cars
and street, lights of the entire city. The
hotels were unable to warm, their rooms
to-night, for the water had compelled the
extinguishment of the fires in all their
boilers. The guests of the Mansion House,
a second-class hotel, located near the river,
had to be taken out in boats to other
places.
The traffic with villages on the east
shore is largely cut off, as the approach to
the bridge is under water.
At Bath-on-the-Hudson the wall of the
East Albany water works was crushed by
the breaking of an ice gorge which bad
formed just above the pumphouse. En
gineer Ward had a narrow escape, having
stepped out to take a look at the torrent
when the catastrophe occurred.
Just about the time the accident at the
pumphouse occurred tbe . local train leav
ing Troy at 2 o'clock was due. The ice
was piled all over the tracks for a distance
of several hundred - feet. In some places
the ice was five feet high. Fortunately
the train was signaled in time to prevent a
serious accident, it being brought to a
standstill 100 feet from the ice. The train
contained over 100 passengers. ._;.

FAST AND FURIOUS CONTEST.
Honors Were Easy Until the Chicago
Lad Found His Opponent's
Jaw.
DULUTH, Minn., March I.â train
consisting of two coaches crowded with
sports pulled out of the Union depot over
the St. Paul and Duluth line this after
noon to be conveyed to an unknown battle
ground, where its passengers were to wit
ness a fight to a finish between Jimmy
Murphy of Chicago and Billy Patterson of
San Francisco, both lightweights. At 4:15
T. m., after a twenty-mile run, the train
came to a stop and the crowd started out
to select a suitable battlefield.
After some little time, most of which
was spent in wading through snow, climb
ing over logs and fences, an opening was
found in the woods and men with shovels
and picks began clearing away the snow
for a ring. After some labor everything
was ready and the two principals were
called from the cars to battle.
The fight, which lasted six rounds, was
fast and furious from the start. ; Neither'
had much advantage until the fifth round,
when Murphy landed a stiff one on Patter
son's jaw, which made him weary. In the
sixth and last round Patterson did some
good work, but Murphy seemed fresher,
flooring Patterson once. He did not rise
until the ninth second, when Murphy
made a rush and Patterson went down
again to avoid punishment. Patterson
had been bleeding freely from the nose,
and his costume was fairly saturated.
This, together with his falling to avoid
punishment, although apparently far from
bein â¢ knocked out, caused the referee to
declare Murphy the winner. They fought
for a purse of $150 and gate receipts. .

ST. PAUL, Minx., March Archbishop
Ireland made an impassioned address to
an audience which packed the Metropoli

afternoon in a protest against the atroci

, "Let us give somothing of what we have.
Let it go afcroad before all the nations of
the world that, when the people of Arme

all their possessions, messengers from that
distant land, the United States,' bore gifts
in the name of liberty, civilization and
Christianity. And let it be known to the
most remote countries of Asia and Africa
that wherever men suffer the sympathies
of America will go. And in no better way
than in ; this disinterested charity can we
make it plain to the entire world that
America is worthy of her fame as a coun

Van Arman of Arizona, who has succeeded

pany with a capital stock of $2,000,000 for
the purpose of investment in a California

Mr. Van Arman reports a revival of in

Arizona and says that the gold output of
the Pacific Coast last year was $27,000,000.
He reports a new menace to Pacific Slope
interests in the Japan manufacturers who,
he thinks, will demoralize American in

unless checked by a strong protective
tariff.
He says that 'the Pacific Coast States

would benefit the West as well as the
entire country, so he believes, because it

BIG FIRE AT TACOMA.
Dryhouse and Engine- House Burned Through
an Electric Wireâ
$25,0(0
TACOMA, Wash., March I.âA-disas
| trous fire occurred this afternoon, result
ing in the destruction of the dry house and
j engine-house of the St. Paul Mill, situated
directly across the Eleventh-street bridge
and east of the city. The cause was attrib
utable to an electric light wire, and a fierce
conflagration was on. .before the firemen
I could get it under control. This is the sec
| ond time in a year this company has
| suffered the loss of its dryhouse, and the
I dense smoke to-day led people who live
\ on the hill to believe the whole city was
â¢ afire.
The Fire Department at the first alarm
quickly demonstrated the wisdom of the
construction of the Eleventh-street bridge,
which gives a short-cut to the mill and
other large establishments on the tide
fiats, but the fire bad gained such headway
that it was an up-hill fight. The dry
house was rilled and the adjoining piles of
lumber caught, together with the engine
bouse of the Commercial Electric Light
Company.
Colonel Griggs, one of the owners of the
mill, estimates the loss at 125,000, only
partially insured. It will be rebuilt at
QUEEN YIOTOEIA'S HOUSES.
Her Countless Acres of Forest and Farm
Land and Her Four Old Yachts.
The announcement that Queen Victoria
is to leave by will Osborne House to one
daughter, the lease of Abergeldie House to
another, and Balmoral, the royal residence
in the Highlands, to the Duke of Con
naught, recalls the fact that the man who
would devour this particular widow's
bouses must make an uncommonly full
meal. It was discovered a few years since
that the Queen owned 600 houses in vari
ous parts of England, not royal residences,
but rent-yielding property, and that about
6000 houses had been built by crown
lessees on building leaseholds held of the
Queen. She then had also rents from mar
kets and tolls from ferries, besides the
proceeds of mines and other works upon
her property or the crown property.
She had large estates in Yorkshire, Ox
fordshire and Berks; valuable lands in the
Isle of Man and in Alderney, Scotland,
Ireland and Wales. Of the New Forest
there are 2000 acres of absolute and 63
acres of ' contingent crown property. Her
Majesty enjoys income from the Forest
of Dean,, from several other forests and
from rich properties in and about London.
Osborne, on the Isle of Wight, and Bal
moral, in the Highland?, are the private
property of the Queen and are maintained
out of her own income. But she has the
use of a few royal palaces besides, and
these are maintained by the nation at an
annual expenditure ranging from $2500 to
$50,000. The Queen is in the occupancy of
Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, the
White Lodge at Richmond Park and part
of St. James' Palace. The remainder of
the last-named palace is occupied by other
members of the royal family.
Other royal palaces maintained as such,
although not in the occupancy of the
Queen, are Kensington Palace, Hampton
Court, which according to a recent esti
mate based on the statistics of eight or
ten years, costs the nation on the average
over $70,000 a year, Kew Palace, Pem
broke Lodge, the Thatched Cottage, and
Sheen Cottage, Richmond Park, Bushy
House in Busby Park and , Holyrood Pal
ace. The Queen when she visits the con
tinent has one great house- or another,
with 'whatever repairs and refurnishing
are necessary to fit it for a temporary
royal occupant, although for all this she
pays out of her own income. Bagshot
.House, Gloucester House and Clarence
House are palatial dwellings occupied by
various members of the royal family.
The Queen has four rather old fashioned
yachts on which she makes her sea
journeys, although the oldest of them is
probably used seldom or never. .The four
cost originally about $1,375,000.' -The new
est is of 1890 tons displacement and cost a
trifle over $500,000. It costs annually about
$65,000.â N.Y. Sun.
A Poisoned Babbit Stolen.
; A tragt-comic storyâ let os hope it will
end as a farce and not as a serious drama
is reported from Rennes by the Paris cor
respondent of the Telegraph. : A local
chemist, who was making some experi
ments respecting the effects of the virus of
rabies on animals, sent a rabbit to the Pas
teur Institute to be inoculated. This wan
done and the animal returned to its owner,
wno, having no place for it, bad the rabbit
kept in a friend's hutch. A night or two
ago a tramp broke in and stole the rabbit
that had received the poisonous injection.
As a rule such a ' theft â¢ would : not create
much attention, but .now. consternation
reigns among tbe-. inhabitants of the: dis
trict, and rabbits are a perfect glut on the

a Statement to the
Press.
HIS DUTY MADE PLAIN.
The Services ot Himself and
Wife Still Needed by
the Masses.
PLANS NOT YET PERFECTED.
Intends to Work in Full Harmony
With the Legions He Once
Controlled.
: .
; MONTCLAIR, N. J., March 1.-Com
mander and Mrs. Ballington Booth to
night issued the following statement to
the press:
. "Being continually pressed upon all sides
to state definitely the action we shall take
in the future, we now desire to make
known our present position.
"We did not wish it said that we had
. taken the Salvation Army; that we had,
â¢ through ambition, swept the organization
' \ in this country out of the general's hands,
or that we had taken property which- we
had acquired while owing allegiance to
. him. Furthermore, we did not want to
influence those under his authority through
their loyalty and steadfastness to us, nor
have it said that we had proved faithless
'-. to a trust reposed In us, so far as adminis
tration was concerned. We had no alterna
tive but to accept our dismissal, which
closed our relationships and negotiations
with London. Since then we have allowed
â¢ those in authority full scope, neither ap
pearing in public nor counseling any be
neath their command to leave.
"We cannot, however, close our eyes to
the fact that we have another allegiance;
we are not our own and cannot dispose of
our lives and influence to please ourselves.
God has called us to work for him. We
dare not, therefore, remain idle. We have
also at heart the interest of our country
that so loudly called to lus to continue in
action. Seeing that the people of the
United States, in an urgent and unmistak
able manner, have voiced their desire tbat
we should inaugurate a movement afford
ing us an opportunity to continue our
labors for the uplifting of the nncherished
and unchristened people of our country;
and as there appeared to us no alternative
. between this course and retiring from pub
lic service, we have decided upon the
former action. It is farthest from our de
sire that such a new and independent
movement should be hostile to the one we
have labored so long and so hard to up
build. The United States, with its vast
â¢ and ever-increasing population, should
offer ample room for such effort without
any unchristian warring. . *. V : ; l*Â£ ' ]\ c
â 'â  "It would be premature here to decide
upon the details of our future labor. We
seek above all else God's leading. An
organization cannot be formulated on the
opinions and enthusiasms of the moment.
We shall probably have but a small be
ginning and gain step by step.
; "We. shall assuredly under any circum
stances stand for the principles we have
hitherto upheld, having for our aims the
saving of souls, the unity of effort in
work, scriptural plainness and self-sac
rifice of life, and simplicity and distinct
iveness of dress that speaks' of out-and-out
Christ. following.
"We cannot at this perplexed juncture,
overtired in body and overstrained in
nerve, give the date when We shall be
ready to commence public work. Indeed,
it will be seen to be wise to do nothing in
baste lest it should be ill done, but to do
.all with forethought that it may be well
and permanently done. We are most
anxious not to act on impulse or under
â¢ strong, pressure, but as God shall guide us
through circumstances, and with cool,
â¢ calm judgment as to what we believe and
â  feel to be right. H_9
;-.; "In closing, we desire to assure all who
are interested in this matter that we have
'..'- earnestly consecrated our lives to the ser
: vice of strengthening righteous principles
' and extending God's kingdom in Amer
: ica. â¢ Ballixgtos Booth,
,; "Maud B. Booth."
. A circular letter also has been sent to
friends all over America by Mr. and Mrs.
Ballington Booth giving their side of the
: case. They refute the statement that they
. had refused to obey orders from London.
Reference is made to a letter sent to the
-. international headquarters on January 31,
-.in which Commander and Mrs. Booth
stated that they were going quietly through
their farewell, but that for certain reasons
they could not feel free to enter upon
-another command. This letter, they
claim, has been called a resignation, but it
was in truth merely a statement of the sit
} uation. Continuing, Mr. and Mrs. Booth
* say -
"We therefore emphatically repeat that
we are in our present condition not
through disobedience of orders (especially
as no orders other than those giving up
our command had been received), but
â¢ from the fact that they peremptorily took
the .situation into their own hands and
forced us out."
The letter concludes: "Some who owe
. much to us have forgotten their affection
and. at this trying moment have been per
. suaded to misunderstand us, but time will
show them wherein they are wrong and
wherein we are wronged. We have told
officers and soldiers to stand by the army,
-. but we do not think that need of necessity
mean that they are to approve of its ac
tion toward their old leaders or to turn
'" In their hearts from those who have faith
fully lived and suffered and worked for
; : them." â  .
EVA BOOTH HISSED.
Unfriendly Demonstration Greets Her
First Appearance in Xew lork.
NEW YORK, N. V., March I.âCommis
sioner Eva Booth, the new commander of
the Salvation Army, made her first public
appearance in this city at a meeting. in
Cooper Union to-niebt, and the reception
she received from the 4000. persons present
was distinctly unfriendly. She was hissed
as she walked through the; line of staff
officers to the front of the platform, and
again, in spite of the appeals of two previ
ous speakers for fair play for her, the open
ing words of her address were greeted in
like fashion. 7 The hissing was not general,
but cazae from all parts of the hall and was
silenced only by the rattling of the big
drums.
Commissioner Booth touched but lightly
on the troubles in the army, and asked in
dulgence on the ground that her present
position came to her in the line. of duty
and was none of her choosing.
NEWARK, N. J., Mr.rch I.âCommis
sioner Eva Booth of the Salvation Army
came here this afternoon with the inten
tion of quelling a revolution which is al
leged to be budding in the local corps, but
when she appeared in the hall she was
hissed by an audience of about 1500 peo
ple. Colonel Nicol, who accompanied her,
was jeered, while cheers were given for
ex-Commander Ballington Booth. The
local soldiers wore American flags pinned
to their breasts.
Ballington Booth sent word from Mont
clair to-night not to revolt, and the cap
tain or the corps restored order after Miss
Booth had returned to New York.
MAJOR GIFFORD'S VIEWS.
Believes That Ballington Booth Will
Hare a Large Following.
SEATTLE, Wash., March 1. â Major
Adam Gilford, successor to Major Percy,
commander of this division of the Salva
tion Army, comprising the States of Wash
ington, Oregon and the southern half of
Idaho, arrived in this city to-night and
assumed command. He was transferred
from tne Southern Michigan district, with
headquarters at Detroit. Major Gifford
has been two weeks en route, his itinerary
including San Francisco, and consequently
heard but little of the disruption in the
Salvation Army. In fact, at the time of
the change he had no warning of the resig
nation or removal of the American com
mander, Ballington Booth.
When asked what support Ballington
Booth would have in the movement to
establish an American Salvation Army
Major Gifford replied :
"1 think he will have a large following,
but what percentage of the present army
will co with him I can hardly tell." *. v
"Would you follow Ballington Booth in
such a movement
"I can hardly answer that question, for
it is a difficult one," was the reply. "How
ever, I may say that I have sworn to sup
yÂ»or the present organization. I know but
little as to the merits of this controversy,
and until I am better posted in the prem
ises I prefer not to say more."
Major Gifford has been identified with
the Salvation Army for twelve years.
BALLIXGTOX BOOTH SUSTAIXED.
San Jose's Salvationists Are Almost a
Unit in His Favor.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March I.â ln a poll of
the members of the Salvation Army Corps
of this city there was an overwhelming
vote of confidence in Ballington Booth,
and an expression of support of him in
any course that he may see fit to take in"
his differences with his father, General
Booth of England. The vote was 60 to 3
in favor of Ballington Booth, thirteen of
the local officers being in favor of him, to
one against. Those who did not vote in
his favor were simply indecisive as to what
action to take in the emergency. The
opinion here is in favor of establishing
independence from English dominion of
the army in the United States.
Captain Thompson will leave to-day for
San Francisco by command of Brigadier-
General Keppel, id attend a conference of
officers to be held in San Francisco.

ground and the weather began to mod
erate slightly. â¢
This was the first sight of snow that res
idents of this city had seen for eight years,
and it drew as many people on the streets
as a passing parade. The only apprehen
sion felt was by fruit-growers, as the last
few days have been very warm and the
fruit trees are nearly in full bloom.
A frost to-night will result in great dam
age to the fruit crop, and as the weather
has cleared and the wind is dying out
those interested are fearful that there will
be a white covering on the ground in the
morning. Blrs|
FROST AT NEWCASTLE.
Fears That Peach, Plum, Apricot and
Cherry Trees Are Injured.
NEWCASTLE,, March The fine
weather which has prevailed here for the
past three weeks closed with a frost last
night. The peaches, plums and early
apricots and cherries, which are in full
bloom, are thought by many to be seri
ously injured, while others express the
opinion that there is very little damage
done in this immediate vicinity. How
ever, it is certain that some of the cherries
are injured, but not enough to make much
difference in the crop, as a certain amount
of the crop will have to drop anyway in
order to do well.
Little can be told at present as to the
amount of the loss, if any, as it will be
several days before injured' blossoms will
fall, and nothing can be told as to the
looks of the blossoms at present. ,;'\:'i\.f.
The pears are not out as yet, conse
quently there will be no loss in that line
in any way.
Snow began to fall at about 5
o'clock this evening, continuing about fif
teen minutes and melting nearly as fast as
it fell. It is feared that it will clear up to
night and be accompanied by frost.
SHARP FROST AT SACRAMEXTO.
Trees in Bloom and Young Fruit Are
Badly Kipped.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March I.â A re
port comes from the American River fruit
district to-day that quite v sharp frost last
night did great damage among the
orchards there. Many varieties of fruit
trees have been in full bloom for nearly a
month, and the young fruit was well
formed and promised an early and heavy
yield. Orchardists have feared the result
of such warm weather in February, as
March often brings cold snaps, with an oc
casional frosty night. No reports from
other localities have been received, but it
is feared that the apricot and cherry crops
along the lower Sacramento River may
possibly have been nipped.
FIERCE GALES AT TACOMA.
The Sound a Whirlpool of Foamâ Small
Craft in Danger.
TACOMA, Wash., March 1. â The
weather last evening, to-day and to-night
is the severest experienced here for a long
time. The gale wed up the sound into
a whirlpool of foam and it became ex
tremely hazardous for small craft to ven
ture out. A large boom of logs broke
loose from the -St. Paul mill, and, aided
by the wind and rough sea, pounded
against the flouring-mill wharf, doing con
siderable damage, and it was only after
several perilous efforts, in which several
men narrowly escaped being drowned,
that the raft was secured.
BLOWIXG AT SAXTA BARBARA.
The Monterey Puts In to Dodge the
â¢ Bough . Weather.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., March 1 I.â
The Monterey came in from the south
at noon to-day and is lying in the harbor.
It is understood that she ran in to avoid
the rough weather outside, as she sits so
low that the water was washing over her
decks. One of her boats was carried away
last night. The sky is clear, but still a
gale has been blowing for the past four
days, and the water even in the channel is
unusually rough.
Real Winter at Santa Cruz.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March I.â To-day
was the first real winter day since the rain
storms of January. The past month 5 has
been more like summer, but on Saturday
morning the change came with ; a light
rain just before daylight and hail about 7
o'clock. The : day v was cool. But j to-day
there has been cold showers and decidedly
cold, raw weather. V Indications are that
there will be a blustery March. Farmers
welcome the light showers and wish for
more.
Almost Down to Zero at Spokane.
SPOKANE, Wash., March I.â A cold
wave set in last night after six weeks of
uninterrupted spring weather. In twelve
hours the temperature fell r4O degrees,
registering 11 degrees above zero : this
morning. The indications are ; that zero
or below will be reached to-night. It ,is
believed that incalculable ; damage , has
been done to budding fruit throughout the
Northwest. * ' ."
W. C. T. U. Tea at Florin.
FLORIN, Cal., Feb.; 24.â The W. c. T.
IT. of this place held - their quarterly tea at
the residence of Jasper Howell. A goodly
number ; turned out * and - a very entertain
ing and enjoyable evening was spent,* no
particular programme being '.' planned.
Music was â¢ furnished by Mr. French, or
ganist^ Mr. .Whitman, first violin; Mr.
Finch, second violin. .. A, song, "Around
the .World," was sung by Mrs. Robinson
and others, then readings ' on temperance
and| : other topics for the good of all.
After more appropriate songs, Mrs. San
ders presented the honorary members with
pure white celluloid pins, ; to be used as
badges, which are very highly prized by
them. The ladies then served all with
coffee and cake, and a general social time
ensued. The assembly was dismissed after
prayer by Rev. H. B. Sheldon. . ' .
Ogden's Municipal Muddle.
OGDEN, Utah, ; Feb. 29. â Ogden's
municipal muddle- was augmented to-day
by a suit filed by ex-City Attorney Whip
ple against the Democratic appointee,
Henderson, to have the latter ousted and
the office turned over to the former, with
emoluments and costs of suit. The basis
of the action is section 10 of article XXIV
of the new constitution, which : provides
that "all officers, civil or military, now
holding offices and appointments, shall
continue to do so until superceded under
this constitution." Henderson ; was ap
pointed after the statehood proclamation
was signed by the President, hence the
contention.
Six Inches of Snow at Roseburg.
ROSEBURG, Or., March I.â Snow to
the depth of six inches fell last nightâ the
deepest in three years. The storm is un
precedented in the history of the country
for this season of the year. Immense
damage has been done to early fruit.
Severe Frost at Chico.
CHICO, Cal., March I.â A cold snap
struck Cnico last night. Ice was formed in
parts of the city and water pipes were
frozen. Almonds, peaches and apricots
suffered considerably, also orange trees.
AN OIL CLAIM JUMPED
The First Serious Difficulty Grow
ing Out of the Coalinga
Discovery.
An Animated Contest Which Will Un
doubtedly Be Taken Into the
Courts.
FRESNO, Cal., March I.â A contest of
claimants seems inevitable over what
promises to be the most important dis
covery made in this part of the State for
years, at Coalinga, in the southwest corner
of this county. This contest was opened
yesterday when Captain Frank Barrett,
the well-known Selma capitalist, filed with
the Recorder of this county a petroleum
location on the claim of Milton Mc-
Whorter in the West Side oil fields.
Barrett filed his claim 1 minute past 8
o'clock yesterday, morning. McWhorter
filed asimilar one 56 minutes' past 8. Bar
rett nailed up a location notice on the site
of the claim ten minutes before McWhorter
nailed up a similar notice. As far as these
instruments and notices go Captain Bar
rett appears to have the better of the mat
ter. ;.; ' y.
The claim in question is one which Mc-
Whorter has been developing for two
years past. He has the best well in the
district, which produces seventeen barrels
of petroleum a day. He also has a small
refinery in operation, and he has bored a
water wellâ expensive undertaking in
that part of the country. The claim is
considered a valuable one.
Barrett bases his right to "jump" Mc-
Whorter's claim on flaws in the McWhorter
title to the property. McWhorter will con
test the legal propositions raised by Bar
rett, and an interesting lawsuit is in pros
pect. j s'l V l .' â¢. v.!
The alleged flaw in McWhorter's title is
said to be defective filing of his .original
location. It appears that some years ago
a mineral district was formed in the oil
bearing regions. , ; , Â»
The Recorder of Locations was elected
to office for two years. At the expiration
of that. time he continued to 3erve, al
though he had not been re-elected. It was
while he was thus serving that McWhorter
filed his location. Barrett's contention is
that the Recorder had no authority to
place McWhorter's filing on record at the
time. &j_9
It appears that Barrett has a claim ad
joining McWhorter's, and that a disagree
ment arose between * them which caused
Barrett to "jump" his neighbor's claim.
McWhorter heard of Barrett's intention,
and in order to save the expense of a law
suit he decided to file a new location. Bar
rett beat McWhorter in posting up the site
location. In the race to the County Re
corder's office Barrett came by rail, while
McWhorter drove a team.
A SANTA MONICA EVENT
The New Methodist Church Dedi
cated With Impressive
Ceremonies.
Crowds of People of All Classes, Con
ditions, Creeds and Nationalities
Participate.
SANTA MONICA, Cal., March I.â The
new and imposing house of worship of the
Methodists of Santa Monica was dedicated
to-day .'by the impressive and beautiful
services of , the church. There were five
services, the entire day being set apart. to
the .sacred work, and the church was
crowded to its utmost capacity by our citi
zens of all ' classes and conditions, all
creeds and .nationalities, who lent their
presence to the occasion, rejoicing in the
good to all in the erection and consecra
tion of the handsome church edifice to the
cause of humanity. \
The first service was held at 11 o'clock,
being the main and dedicatory, one. It
was participated in by all the former pas
'' tors, with the exception of the Rev. A. B.
Morrison, who was unavoidably detained
elsewhere. â  . '__3SMiMSÃiaaggÃgjÃl^
After a preliminary service of music and
Scriptural readings Presiding Elder Rev.
J. B. Green delivered the dedicatory ser
mon, taking for hi ttext Romans 1, 16, and
preached a powerful and eloquent sermon
on not being ashamed of tne Gospel of
Christ. He claimed that it was part of the
essential life :of the ' Christian â¢-, not *to be
ashamed of -. the : Master or his life'- and
works, and that the one who was truly his
disciple would \be \ happy at all times and ;
in all places to not [only declare his alle
giance but to â¢ endeavor to.l win â¢ others Ito
the same happy conclusions,' so that he
could say with % Paul: "For 'I*am .â¢ not
ashamed of the ;j Gospel of Christ.'' The
building of such a house of I worship dedi
cated to the Prince of Peace was a declara
tion enduring as long as the last piece of it
remained. . ', ' ' ..'Â«.' â  "
â¬ The building was then presented for the
donor â¢^ to * the i trustees, who ." in turn j pre
sented it to the presiding elder for dedica
tion, who did so in an impressive manner.
The doxology was sung, the benediction
of the Peace of the Godhead "> uttered and
the dedicatory services were at an end.
There was- an interesting reminiscence
meeting held at 3 m., led by the Rev. A.
M. Gough i and '=? participated in "by .Â£ the
former pastors and ; citizens. At 6:30 p. m.
the Epworth league was addressed by Dr.

MARE ISLAND
AND VALLEJO
Working Night and Day to
Finish the Monitor
Monadnock.
MAY BE SENT TO CUBA.
Lack of Funds Seriously Ties Up
Necessary Operations at
the Yard.
OREGON ' BILLETS IN DEMAND.
The Bennington Is Expected Shortly
' From Honolulu â Miscellaneous
Notes of Interest.
VALLEJO, Cal., March I.â The board
of inspection on the Monadnock will with
out doubt give only a favorable report on
the monitor, as so far everything pertain
ing to her has been found in excellent con
dition, and within a short time she will be
steaming on her way down to San Diego.
The finishing up on her has I required in
cessant work, day and night. What the
particular object has been can only be sur
mised from recent reports from the seat of
Government relative to the condition of af
fairs in Cuba. y r
The Baltimore was found on being taken
in dock to be comparatively free from
marine growth so often found on ships of
war coming from the Orient. ' No orders
have yet been received as to whether the
contemplated repairs to be made will be
temporary or permanent; if the former a
few weeks will be sufficient; if the latter,
six months will be required. The reports
as to her condition have not yet been made
to the department.
The next ship to arrive at the yard will
be the Bennington from Honolulu with a
number of short-time men on board, who
will on her arrival be sent East by rail.
â¢ Many applications in person and by let
ter are received daily on board the receiv
ing-ship for billets on the Oregon when
she is ready for commission.. Many of the
positions sought after are for writers, sea
men and machinists. Since the new
order designating that continuous-service
men are to have the preference in the first
two named places, it is an extremely hard
matter for one green in the service to ob
tain such a place unless some strong influ
ence is brought to bear on the Secretary of
the Navy, who now makes such appoint
ments. "In years gone by. this duty rested
with the commanding officerof the ship to
make his own appointments; but time
makes changes in all manner of things on
board of ships of the new navy, even to
the matter of food served to .the messes.
All kinds of canned goods are now served
out, just as a family man can go into a
grocery-store and there make his selection
of meats and delicacies. â¢ "
: Take such a rate ship as the Baltimore,
and thousands of cans of meat are stowed
in the bold among the paymaster's stores
to be served out from day to day In addi
tion to fresh and salted provisions. No
wonder the men all look- so sleek and
hearty when they come on shore, and ap
pear, except in isolated cases, to be con
tent with their shipboard life. ; They are
well clad, and it is seldom a slovenly
dressed bluejacket is found on our streets.
The personnel of the navy seems to be on
a much higher plane, and more good men
are desirous of shipping in the navy or
enlisting in the marine corps. "â¢â 'â 
The men at the barracks and in the
guard on the Independence are a fine-look
ing body of marine soldiery. The parade
ground is one of the .beat in the country,
and everything about the barracks is neat
and orderly. During inclement weather
the men have little else outside of guard
mount to do. Some little exercising in
the manual of arms that can be performed
indoors is about all that is required.
The Monad nock carries no marine guard,
their duty : devolving on the bluejackets.
It is only on monitors ' and small vessels
that no marine is detailed for duty. ;
From the Asiatic station two more of the
smaller ships will sobn come, and if they
go out of commission a crew for the Oregon
will be made up, with possibly some from
the East. It will, however, be sometime
before they will be required. â : â  '
. The various shops throughout the yard
arc . running light. There is plenty of
work to keep the men employed, but the
appropriations are about exhausted. With
the exception of this, all the pile-driver
men who have of late been' engaged on an
extension to the quay wall at the upper
end of the, yard have received their dis
charge, which implies that it will be some
time before they resume work. Men must
be taken on sixty days prior to the Na
tional election, otherwise for two months
longer they will be out of employment.
The. urgent deficiency bill if passed will
set the wheels in motion and give employ
ment to those now in enforced idleness.
The fire brigade was called out the
other night and iin quick order had sev
eral streams of water playing on an
imaginary fire. Captain Barker, captain
of the yard, is a firm believer in being
prepared for ; any emergency in case â ofâ ? a
conflagration, and so frequently has an
alarm turned in 'to keep the brigade
drilled in an efficient manner.
The lecture given by Medical Inspector
Woods on the voyagings of the Charles
ton, in our city for the benefit of the Naval
Union, was a rare treat, and a repetition
of the ', lecture before ; a San Francisco
audience would undoubtedly be highly
appreciated. >
Lieutenant Carlin reported for duty
Saturday as executive of the Independ
ence. The; lieutenant has -had much
service on tbe coast and his ; presence 'â , is -a
welcome addition to the naval colony at
tin* yard and among : those resident in
Vallejo. , l
The purchasers of old junk are fast re
moving their belongings from the yard,
and in another two weeks their traps will
have been taken away. v- -
A lot of the condemned guns eliminated
from the schedule prior to the sale have
been retained and will be used with muz
zles inverted down as bollards and hold
fasts along the water front and in various
places about the yard.' " -",- > .-:. - r ;>
; The ; Sketch 'i Club ! members . are busy in
getting ready for another -art exhibition,
and it goes without saying that much im
provement will be noticed in the collec
tion over any of their previous efforts."
Although 'some I weeks off, preparations
ere already being made 'for. an Easter ser
vice of i more than i ordinary interest and
attractiveness 'â  in l the \ way of =â  music and

GOOD ROADS FOR SAXTA CRUZ.
Wheelmen, Partners and Business Men
Are Hand in Hand.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March I.â About
fifty wheelmen, farmers and business men
met at the handsome residence of Super
visor A. P. Stanton at Walnut Heights,
three miles below Aptos, to-day to select
committees to arrange for a County Good
Roads Convention. The county convention
will select delegate's to attend a State con
vention to be held at San Jose in May.
Lieutenant-Governor Jeter was selected
chairman of the meeting. He appointed
I. H. Tuttle of Watsonville, L. E. W.
Pioda and F. A. Hihn of Santa Cruz to
present to the Board of Supervisors to
morrow a request for the calling or the
county convention to be held under the
authority of an official call by the board.
A committee of five was appointed to draft
resolutions to be presented to such county
conventions.
The Pilot Wheel Club of this city and
the Pajaro Valley wheelmen of Watson
ville were represented at to-day's meeting
by a strong delegation each and a number
of the solid farmer folk. They were all in
good earnest on the subject of good roads,
and Supervisor Stanton evinced his inter
est in the subject by a handsome reception
and banquet to the visitors. The effect of
the meeting was improved by the presence
of F. A. Hihn. Colonel Younger, District

FOUND GUILTY OF MURDER
Story of the Killing of Emmett
Fox by Frank Smith at
Genesee, Idaho.
Three Men Planned to Rob Himâ He
Resisted and Was Shot to
Death.
MOSCOW, Idaho, March I.â The jury in
the Fox murder trial returned a verdict of
muraer in the first degree last night.
Frank Smith, the defendant, who had
shown some nervousness before the ap
pearance of the . jury, took the verdict
calmly. The trial of Harry Gordon on the
same charge began late yesterday after
noon.
Emmett Fox was shot and killed at Gen
esee, Idaho, January 21 last. He had
been attending a dance, drove into Gen
esee and hitched his horse while he played
a few games of billiards. When he re
turned and while in the act of unhitching
his horse he was shot. He fell in the
street and before help arrived he was dead.
Some residents of the town reported that
they had seen a man running on one of the
back streets. A posse was organized and
with the aid of a lantern readily tracked
the^fugitive, there being a light snow on the
ground. The posse followed the murderer
all night, tracking him twelve or fifteen
miles. The posse, however, became ex
hausted before success had crowned their
efforts and returned to town.
- Another posse organized and took up
the pursuit. Deputy Sheriff Bundy re
turned to Genesee January 23 with three
prisoners, Harry Gordon, Charles C. Cole
and Frank Smith, who were charged with
the murder. Smith was captured the
even of the 23rd of January.
After the murder/Smith ran off, closely
followed by the pursuing force. The trail
was lost by the posse at Rimrock, owing to
the melting snow. After traveling about
thirty miles Smith returned * to" Genesee,
where he was arrested. He made a partial
confession, on the strength of which Cole
and Gordon were arrested for complicity
in the crime. The murderers had planned
to hold up Fox, and on his refusal to yield
up his money, they shot him. Smith made
a complete confession a few days later, but
alleged that Gordon fired the fatal shot.
Slaughter- House Burned at Ogden.
OGDEN, Utah, March I.â Late last

WILLIAM GEORGE, MAYOR OF GRASS VALLEY.
.-. important, quartz-mining district of the I
. State; .in fact, the early history of Grass j
''. Valley is a history of quartz-mining, as it
.."' was here that gold was first discovered in
quartz. in California. Ana it is a signifi
j cant fact that the section in which this 1
discovery was first made is again about to
be operated extensively, electric power be
ing employed to operate the mines which
have remained idle on account of the enor
.mous cost of. steam and water power.
â¢ While the interests of Grass Valley are
diversified it is in quartz-mining that the
inhabitants place their confidence, and
from which id derived their employment.
The mines in Grass Valley are the deepest
gold mines in the State, and fully prove
the assertion often made that deep min
ing'pays. The ledges run from one to two
feet in width, and necessarily ; must carry
much free gold to pay for profitable work
ing. The total amount of gold extracted
since 1850, when gold in quartz was first
discovered, amounts to $120,000,000, and at
the present time prospects Took bright for
the sura to increase to double the amount.
The old mines are still producing hand
somely and new prospects are looking
bright.
Among the new enterprises under way
is the Massachusetts Hill mine, which is
to be operated by compressed air, the first
plant of the kind in the United States, and
which has been installed at an expense of
$250,000. This is an old property recently
reopened. The Bullion is another new
enterprise which gives great promise, and
is ably managed by George Mainhart, a
mining man of much prominence, who
has been very successful in his chosen
line. This mine is to be operated by elec
tricity, the first to be so worked in this
district.
The Gold Hill mine is undergoing re
pairs preparatory to reopening, and will
also be operated by electricity. This mine
is situated on the hill where gold quartz

quartz mine in the State.
An enterprise in which tbe people have
great hopes is the Nevada County Electric
Power Company, which has erected a plant
on Deer Creek and is now able to furnish
power for the operators of mines, who
otherwise would remain idle on account
of lack of water or the great expense of
steam.
Grass Valley contains about 8000 inhabi
tants. It is situated in a valley surrounded
by foothills, in which are located the
mines. It is decidedly picturesque, and
its elevation of 2400 feet above the level of
the sea, surrounded by forests of pines,
makes it one of the healthiest cities in the
interior of California.
Its city â¢government is conducted under
a special charter. It has a Mayor and
board of â¢ five Trustees, who conduct the
business interests of the city. The city
also owns its own water works, the water
being brought from .the Sierra . Nevada
Mountains,- and rates are reasonable.
The public school system is one of the
best in the State, 900 pupils being, the
average daily attendance, presided over
by twenty-two teachers. -'. *
The streets are macadamized, the waste
material from â¢ the mines providing abun
dant material for the purpose.
The business portion of the city is sub
stantially built of brick, and in the resi
dence portion new homes of wooden archi
tecture are daily becoming more numerous.
Grass Valley citizens as a class are al
ways loyal to home interests, and fore
most among them is John F. Kidder,
president of the N. C. N. G. R. R., whose
improvements during the last year are of
a most substantial kind. He is popular
with all, a Re publican whose advice is al
ways ' sought lor by the leaders' of the
party, and above all a most enterprising
citizen. ' r
Mayor George is an old-time merchant
who has been very successful. He has
served the district in 'J; the State Senate,
and is none too proud to hold the impor
, tant and humble position of Mayor.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 2, 1896.
Eminent in mining matters and a hail
fellow well met, George Mainhart occupies
a position in the hearts of the people sec
ond to none. Much of the prosperity of
Grass Valley is due to his efforts, and every
enterprise of benefit to the city has his
hearty support. â ';
Three daily newspapers chronicle the
local history of the place and all unite in
advancing its interests and the welfare of
the country. The Daily Tidings and Even
ing Telegraph are issued every 'evening
and the Union fills the morning field.
Grass Valley has not experienced the set
backs frequent ; in ; the history of
mining towns, and she proudly stands as
an example of what legitimate mining
can accomplish. It it truly the "Quartz

REV. DR. DILLE'3 SERMON.
He Talks of the Necessity of Providing
Homes for Tonus; Men.
The Rev. Dr. Dille delivered bis even
ing sermon last night to a congregation
that filled every seat in the Central M. E.
Church.
His sermon was a continuation j^f. a
series of talks on the subject of amuse
ments. He said that it is a duty of the
church to provide healthy recreation fir
the young people, particularly young men
who in this City are without homes. The
Young Men's Christian Association he
said did work in this line, but that it can
not look after one in ten of the homeless
young men of the City and asserted that
there are at least 15,000 young men who do
not know what home is. The church he
said should be open to these so they would
turn from the saloon, the dives- and the
theaters, -.v
; lie expresseu himself as opposed to fish
ponds, grab- bags, ring cakes and the like as
means to raise funds for the church and
declared that a church that stoops to such
methods should bury itself decently and
that quickly. He expressed the belief
that the church of the future would be
onen every day in the week and that it
would have bright and cheerful, rooms
with good literature 1 . and the magazines.
He also spoke of the need of home influ
ence to keep young people there instead of
having them run around at nights and
urged the need of making the homo at
tractive. '

SOME POLITICAL DOUBTS
Those Waiting Questions About
Republican Congressional
Committees.
The Week Will Also Bring Chris
Buckley and Developments in
the Junta Fights.
The members of the Republican State
Central, Committee from the interior had,
with few exceptions, departed for 'home
yesterday, and about- the City the politi
cians generally made themselves comfort
able or joyous and kept "oat of politics."
To-day and during trie week -there will
be careful studies made by/ many Repub
licans to straighten out the initial confu
sion that has followed the new and strange
plan of having the primary elections for
the State convention held under the au
spices of Congressional district committees.
As these: committees have heretofore in
most cases been hardly more than nom
inally organized, been rather perfunctorily
concerned with I the campaigns of I single
individuals and been speedily forgotten, it
will take a little time and effort to deter
mine just when, how and to what extent
these committees were organized , during
the campaign; of ; 1894. and: so what claim
they may have to actual existence.
. As the ; ; members of tne State Central
Committee, representing the various Con
gressional district committees, have power
to create new Congressional district com
mittees in their districts if none now exist,
there may arise contentions as to whether
such committees properly exist or are to
be created. In the Third District the com
mitteemen representing that territory have
already ignored the committee appointed
by ; Hillborn and named a new one. It is
held by same that the only Congressional
committees of the last campaign which
are to be now recognized are the ones
created by district conventions at tbe time
of the last State convention. In the cases
of some districts the delegates left the
appointment of those committees to 'the
nominees for Congress. The course of ac
tion which the Congressional committees
will respectively pursue is another matter
for development. .
In accordance with the call issued by the
National Committee this year and the cor
responding one adopted by the State Cen
tral Committee yesterday, the Republican
State Convention, which will meet in Sac
ramento on May 12, will be rather an se
gregation of seven Congressional conven
tions, each of which will independently
name its delegates to the National Conven
tion. All the conventions will assemble
as one State convention to name four dele?
gates-at-iarge. â¢ " â¢ â¢
â¢ The Union League Club promises to be a
strong factor in the coming campaign.
President Stone and a number of the lead
ing members say that they want to see it
made in a larger degree than ever Defore a
State club rather than a local club. They
want to see it large its scope and its field
of work, to continue to grow in member
ship, as it is now doing, and to especially
extend its membership in the interior.
In accordance with this policy the pow
ers of the committee on political action
are to be enlarged, giving it more initial
power and independence than it now pos
sesses under the rules. This committee
will not be likely to do much before nomi
nations are made, but.it is already clear
ing its decks.* Day before yesteraay the
committee met and extended its organiza
tion by electing R. B. Carpenter president
and \v. B. Hamilton secretary. Irving
M. Scott remains chairman. The chair
man and secretary were requested to pre
pare a plan of political action to be con
sidered at a meeting to be held in the near
future. The members of this committee
are the following:
Irving M. Scott, chairman ; R. B. Car
penter, vice-chairman; W. B. Hamilton,
secretary ; M. M. Hecht. Wendell EaÃton,
H. M. Gray, J. B. Barber, M. Cooney, S.
M. Short, A. B. Lemmon, J. E. Doolittle,
C. O'Connor, O. A. Hale, Thomas Flint Jr.,
H. Z. Osborne. George . Stone. This com
mittee includes a representative of each
Congressional district.
The local Demo, situation remains
one of quiescence on the part of the Buck
ley ites, and turmoil and uncertainty in
the Junta. Chris Buckley is expected to
appear in town to-day, after over a
month's sickness and rest at Raven swood.
In the Junta the differ*- between the
headquarters and the Rainev-Daggett ele
ments remain unsettled. That new elec
tion in the Forty-fourth has not yet been
ordered, and strong efforts are being made
to patch up a compromise with Maxwell.
When the new general committee will
meet for organization is not announced
and is uncertain. The factions in the
Thirty-fourth and the -seventh are
still waiting to see what Chairman Sulli
van and the primary committee Twill do
about their quarrels. Sam Rainey is saw
ing wood all the time.
GORI'S PURPOSE PLAYS
The Noted Anarchist Makes His
Appearance as Actor and
Playwright.
The Applause Could Only Re Subdued
by Turning On a Loud â¢
Brass Band.
Pietro Gori appeared in the new roles of
playwright and actor last night. In both
capacities the audience that filled Apollo
Hall gave him the warmest indorsement.
Indeed, at one point in the entertainment
the applause was so obdurate and pro
longed that it finally had to be quelled by
turning on a loud brass band, which
played until the audience, exhausted in
its efforts to be heard above the din, finally
sought refuge in silence.
â  It goes without saying that a man of
Pietro Gori's pronounced views on social
questions would write purpose plays.
The plots of both the dramas he pro
duced last night pointed a moral as well
as adorned a play. The first sketch, "Thy
Neighbor," was of the daring, weird order
of which we have heard so much from:
Europe and as yet have seen so little! The
secondjplay, "The First of May," although
modeled according to Ibsen was very po
etical and was absolutely without any
thing painful in its treatment of social
.problems. , " .
The scene of "Thy Neighbor" takes
place in a pawnshop. There are some
minor . characters, wretched ..'â  workmen
struggling to keep body and soul together,
who come to pawn their little all, and;
harpies who come to prey upon -the un
fortunate, but the chief character was a
womau who comes to pawn a locket given
her by a former lover in order to pay for
a doctor to visit her dying child. " The
donor of the locket, a dissipated society .
man, happens to be indulging in the in
discretion of pawning a valuable watch
and the mother throws herself on his
mercy ; for a dole, reminding him of her
wretched life and appealing to him for the
child's life. --'..: ;!; i . \' â¢'..
There is a rather painful, although tell
ing, scene participated in by Gori, who
has married the woman but cannot get
work ; to Â« support - her. ' The donor : of the
locket spurns the woman â  who kneels to
him, and Gori; infuriated, strikes him and
is arrested, but before giving the blow he
tells his wife â it is too late to pleadâ the
child is dead. "Your locket is -. false; we
can : give you nothing on it," cries the
man at the counter. "Yes, false .;â  as your
love," cries the woman to the donor.
The .; scene : ends when they tell the wife
of her husband's \ arrest. : "I am alone,"
sne* cries, then pausing, adds : ,: "No, not
alone ; there |is the poor dead baby who
awaits my kisses."

was not far from making a point that would count
in a contest of wise sayings. But that question of
proverbs covers a pretty â * wide field. On the one
hand you are told that "Everything comes to him
who knows how to wait," and again that "Those
who knock loudest and longest , will enter first."

harm to tell the truth" (especially if you are going
to shame the devil by the act), but your neighbor
will retort to yon (if he gets tbe chance) that
â¢â¢Silence is golden." This sort of comparison
could go on endlessly, but it is not profitable. The
fact is, if a man has his head ''screwed on level"
and "knows his text" well, he is quite as likely to
make a sage remark as any 'of the sayan ts who
have "gone before" ' and whose glory often rests
principally on the fact that they are dead. Apro-
pos of all this, .Mr. . George 11. Rice, who is not

Mr. Rice Is a Washingtonlanâ his home being at
Fort Canby, in that Stateâ not long ago,
while in a very depressed and nervous condition,
he sought help. His system was all run down

the Hudson Medical Institute, however, came to
his aid, and while it was none too soon, it WM yet
in time. Tin's Is the terse and vigorous way En
which he expresses himself as to the good he re-
ceived from placing himself in the hands of the
wonderful doctors whose big white building stands â¢
on the corner of Stockton, Market and Ellis streets.

AN : ENTHUSIASTIC EXPLORER.
â
It Is Believed He Made His Way Over
the Ice and Found the
North Pole.
â â¢-'â .â ; .
Is: the credit of the discovery of the
north pole due the Danish explorer, Nan
sen, or is the real discoverer an American
â and a former San Francisco boy named
Verhoeff?
This is the question that is being mooted
by the Eastern press, and the latter propo
sition is being vigorously urged by the
relatives of John M. Verhoeff, who left
San Francisco in 1891 to join the Peary ex
pedition to the northwestern coast of
Greenland, from which he has never re
turned.
In March, 1891. Verhoeff first conceived
the. idea of joining Peary. He was then
in this City, where he had a host of friends.
He was a member of the Olympic Club,
and was remarked anions his associates
for a determined, sturdy character, coupled
with restless energy and great powers of
endurance. He was a graduate of Yale,
where he had made a specialty of miner
alogy.
These qualities were such as to naturally
inspire a love for adventure and scientific
investigation, and the fact that he was
possessed of some means left the fulfill
ment of his desires lacking only in a favor
able opportunity. This he belisved to be
furnished in the Peary expedition, and ac
cordingly he entered into correspondence
with Lieutenant Peary.
His unusual qualifications and his wil
lingness to contribute financial aid to the
enterprise secured for him the coveted
berth on board the northward-bound ves
sel. . He was accorded the position of min
eralogist, and the satisfaction with which
he occupied this post is attested by sev
eral letters of keenest appreciation written
in regard to him by Lieutenant Peary.
Before leaving with the expedition Ver
hoeff inquired if there would be any ob
jectionto any ol the members remaining
when the Kite, Peary's vessel, returned.
He was informed that there would he de
cided Objection. Ttia 1 is the last he ever
s^aid about the matter, out members of the
party recollect that he was constantly tak
ing extraordinary measures to inure" him
self to the cold and other conditions of
Arctic life. On one occasion, apparently
for mere sport, he jumped from the vessel
side a;;d swam some distance through the
icy water. He embraced every oppor
tunity to Jive with the natives, and he so
far accustomed himself to the habits of the
Esquimaux that he could .subsist on the
scanty fare w.dch constituted their daily
diet. " 1..- ..tenant Peary declared him to
have been the hardest worker on the ex
pedition, and there was no enterprise too
laborious or too hazardous for him to join
eagerly.
This desire of his to be a party to all en
terprises is said to have occasioned some
hard feeling between him and Lieutenant
Peary. On May 3, 1892, the latter conducted
ah expedition to the iuiaud ice, a trip that
promised much of interest and adventure.
.Verhoeff was anxious to go, but for some
reason Pear; did not see fit to take him,
and. this is supposed to have sealed the
young man's determination to do some in
dependent investigating.
. In spite of Verboefl's chagrin, if such it
wrs, he worked faithfully and obediently,
and in August he was chosen to accom
pany Lieutenant and Mrs. Peary to the
head of IngJefield Gulf, where Mrs. Peary
was to spend the winter.

and the crew of the Kite. Several Es
quimaux also lent their assistance. At the
end of seven days a man's footprints were
discovered leading from Robinsons Bay up
a glacier. Following the trail some min
eral specimens were discovered on a rock,
and a little further on the relics of a camp
. in the shape of a meat can and some grease â¢
. drippings- . , Â»___ v,, r
â¢ ! The glacier at that point was torn .by
dozens of great purges, and the supposition
is that Verhe >ff fell into one + of : them. , A
careful search was made for the body, but
'no trace of it could ibe found. As there
seemed to be no way for a man to get
awn* from the locality without wings, the ,
searc i I a tv concluded that \erheoff must
: liav.- no t his death, and so reported it to
' HO^the return of the Kite to New York
â On the return of the Kite to New Yor* â 
Tie relatives of Verhoeff refused to credit ;
the story of hi? death. .No .blame was at- (
tached "to Lieutenant Peary, however.
Their theory was that the ambitious ad
venturer had remained in the land of ice
voluntarily.
In support of this view the young man's
uncle, Rev. A. N. Keigwin, has written a
latter setting forth the reasons he has for
believing his nephew still alive. In brief
these were : The footsteps : seen were far
from any dangerous point, and the evident
haste of the relief expedition would dis
count this evidence. Against it is Ver
hoeff's lifelong desire to go north as far as
possible; his years' preparation and his
being left in camn when Peary went north ;
his efforts to adapt â himself to the life of
the natives, and his apparent indifference
to going north with the commander of the
expedition, all are viewed by his uncle as
tending toward the view held by him .
Moreover he recites many incidents, such
as his taking with him all his memoranda
and all his instruments which were in
good condition, and all his good clothes
and all his underwear, which seemed to
show conclusively Verhoeff contemplated
a longer trip than he announced. As the
Kite was due to sail in a week it seems
that he could have had but one object in
viewâ to remain ashore and trust to the
natives for subsistence. With their aid
he hoped to reach the north poie.
This his relatives and friends claim he
has now done. They point to the fact
that every circumstance which makes it
appear improbable that the feat was per
formed by Nansen strengthens the theory
that it is the result of Verhoeff 's researches.
John H. Verhoeff was born of Dutch
parents in Louisville, Ky., in 1867, and but
little is known of hft history. His parents
were wealth y and he was so well provided
for that he" contributed largely to the
North Greenland expedition. In fact
Peary stated that but for his financial
assistance the expedition would have had
to have been abandoned.
In a letter written to the secretary of the
American Geographical Society when the
expedition was in the north Lieutenant
Peary speaks in the highest terms of Ver
hoeff's qualifications for undertaking such
a dangerous enterprise. A portion of the
letter is as follows:
"Verhoeff is all that can be desired
physically. He has enormous lung power
and great chest expansion. He has also
some good records for long-distance walk
ing and unusual endurance when deprived
of the proper elements of sustenance."
STOPPED THE WORK.
Police Prevent the Mutual Light and
Power Company From Erect
ing Poles.
Early yesterday morning pedestrians
and drivers were much surprised to see
several gangs of men at work tearing up
the sidewalks along the Blythc block on
Market street and Grant avenue. Where
ever a break was made the workmen at
once sank holes and began to erect short
electric line poles. While in the midst of
their employment a squad of policemen
swooned down upon the laborers and put
a stop to the operations. For a short time
there was a discussion between the lieu
tenant of police and the foreman of the
laborers which resulted in the latter pack
ing up their tools and going away.
All this trouble was occasioned by the
Mutual Light and Power Company neg
loctinr to secure a franchise or permit to
erect its poles.
A week ago the Supervisors notified the
police that the new electric company was
likely to go ahead erecting its poles, and,
as permission had not been given the com
pany to do so, the police were told to 'top
the work a - soon as it was begun. Early
yesterday morning word was sent to the
Central station that the men were at
work. Lieutenant Birdsall telephoned to
Captain Wittman for instructions. The
captain told him to stop the work or arrest
the offenders. The lieutenant, with a
squad of men, followed out the instruc
tions, but did not reach the ground before
several poles were erected. It is said that
several of those responsible for the work
will be arrested to-day.
A NEW MAIL BOAT.
launch and Trial Trip of the W.
Weighel Before Going to
Eel River.
The steam launch W. Weighel was given
to the waves yesterday for the first time.
The little boat was built particularly for
the mail and passenger service of the Cali
fornia, Oregon and Idaho Stage Company.
She is made to carry twelve passengers and
will make daily trips between Scotia, tbe
terminus of the railroad running from
Eureka, and a point thirty miles further
up the river, where it connects with the
stage line from Ukiah.
This water service saves nearly fifty miles
of staging over a particularly rough and
aangerous road. It has been in contem
plation for some time by the stage com
pany, who anticipate a saving in expenses,
shortening of tne time required for the
'rip to Eureka and greater attractiveness
for the route.;
The W. Weighel was launched yester
day morning from the Clay-street wharf.
A crew consisting of William Weigel, ad
miral; Hal Denton, captain; Frank Nash,
chief engineer; William Miller, coxswain,
and James Holl, passenger, at once started
across the bay on a trial trip. Tbouchthe
bay was so rough as to seriously endanger
the health of the captain, the launch be
haved very well and showed that she was
perfectly seaworthy.
The \V. Weighel will be shipped to
Eureka. Humboldt County, by the next
steamer. She will be at work on Eel River
in a few weeks.

made their scores at the Shell Mound
shooting ranee on February 9, and they
made a total of 1939; points, or an average
of 3S 4-5 per man. Their official scores
were forwarded on the next steamer. As
shown by the following letter from George
Manson," the correspondent for The Call
at Honolulu, the. Hawaiian National
Guard made 2009 points, or 40.18 points
per man:
HONOLULU, Hawaii, Feb. 10.â The 200-yard
rifle range of the Hawaiian National Guard is
situated at Makiki, one of the suburbs of Hon
olulu, about a mile and a half from the city. It
consist* of a small gully, with an average
width of fifty feet, covered with undergrowth
and lined on either side with algeroba trees.
It seems to have been naturally designed for
I the use it is now put to. At one end are four
targets, with bullet-proof bulkhead of steel
between, behind which the markers retire.
At the other is a simply constructed shed of
whitewashed lumber, with stalls for eight
marksmen and seats for 'he scorers and a few
spectators. If there are many spectators, as on
Saturday, they must find seats on the turf out
side, from which, being on rising ground, a
good view of the targets is obtained. Captain
E.O.White had charge of the arrangements
on Saturday, and no hitch occurred in the
first international shooting match in which
Hawaii has yet taken part.
The first eight raemto shoot were 8. Johnson,
Petterson and Hanaroldof Company F ; Sproat,
Lohman. Carlyle and Neeley of Company E, and
Rowell of B. Johnson and Lohman both led off
with buliseyes, which looked encouraging, but
the others could not find it, Carlyle only scor
ing 3. This was good shooting and Hawaiian
stock went up a point, the detachment making
a score of 332 points, or an average of 41*-Â£.
The second eight to face the butts were also
from the regulars. Coyne, Barry, Buchanan
and Gouvier lrom Company E, and Ludwig, P.
Johnson, Lambert and Burnett of F. Ludwig
and Lambert carried off the honors of this
squad With 43 each. Burnett started off with
4 and made a total of 39. Gouvier and Coyne
got 41 each, hut Barry and Buchanan only got
33, while Johnson fell down with 35. The
men, however, got 318, or two points loss than
an average of 40.
Sixteen men had now shot, with a score of
650 points or an average of 40% each, which
exceeded Colonel Fisher's estimate, and sev
eral of the best marksmen in the team yet to
shoot.
The third detachment consisted of Captain
Pratt of the President's staff, Elvin and Story
of Company B, McKlnnon, Drummond and
Dexter of . Taylor of E and McKeague of F.
Pratt led off with four, Elvin with five, but
McKennon and Dexter got threes only. In the
next round everybody got four, except, Mc-
Keague, who found the center. This team made
322 points or an average of 40J4. The first
twenty-four men had now gained 972 points,
among them, which was just exactly the aver
age expected by Colonel Fisher, who told your
correspondent belorc the match that he ex
pected the Hawaiian team to average 40}Â£.
The fourth delegation to shoot for the honor
of Hawaii consisted of Smith of J, Sutton,
Moore and Sherwood of Company E, Hagerup
and Friedersdorff of F, Duart of A and Captain
Camara of C. Six of these made forty and
over. 'TlillMiMllÃir'"
This squad ran . the .score up to 1289
points for the thirty-two men.
F. Peterson of CompanyF, Olsen, Parke, Giles
and Schmidt of B, Boyd of D, Ferreira of C and
Board fe!d of A were the next to, shoot, scoring
only 312 points among them and still further
reducing the average. Sixteen hundred and
one poinds had now been made by forty men,
which is good shooting for ;fifty-men-team
matches,. but less than was expected of the
Hawaiian team.
Owing to tardy arrivals only six men shot in
the next bunch. They : were Fitssimmons,
Rpade and Vollberg of Company F, Lieutenant
Shaefer.of E, Captain E. O. White of B and
Lieutenant-Colonel Fisher. They made 244
points. Captain White and Colonel Fisher
Loth found the ' center without any difficulty
the first effort and made 43.
Colonel Fisher made . four buliseyes and a 4
in the first rive shots and - his ? prospects were
good for a big score, but a shower of rain came
on and the light on the target changed so that
lie could not find the center again. His other
five shots were all fours, making his total 44.
With four more men to shoot the score was
now 845 points, or five more than an average
of 40. * â 
â¢J. A. Johnson of Company B,C. Crozier of D
and Drum-Major AW C. ' King were :- next to
shoot. Johnson made 41. i Crozier made 40.
King started off with 4 and made a total of 44.
With a safe man left to : shoot in the person
of Colnnel Soper the Hawaiian team had only
30 points to make to reach the' coveted 2000
points, less than which would -have been dis
grace. -The marksman made a had beginning
with 3, the sights of his rifle being set too low.
His three last shots were planted within an
inch or two of each other, but directly under
the center." His total was 39, making the team
total 2009. 0r.16 points below Colonel Fisher's
estimate, which shows he had a - pretty good
idea of what his men could do.' .

SHOT FOR BED FLAGS.
The Nord Deutscher Schuetzen Club
Opens the Shell Mound Shooting .
Season.
The Shell Mound Park and shooting
range was opened for the season yesterday
and the Berkeley trains were filled with
pleasure-seekers and riflemen from early
in the morning until long after the noon
hour. The affair was under the auspices
of the Nord Deutscher Schuetzen Club.
This pleasure resort has recently been
thoroughly overhauled by Captain . L.
Siebe, the proprietor, who has spent the
best part of his life among the riflemen of
this coast. He received; his -military title
while in command of oneof the companies
of the National Guard of California. Cap
tain Siebe to-day belongs to more rifle
shooting organizations than any man on
the coast. He has made many excellent
musket, fine rifle and pistol shooting rec
ords, and, although on the shady western
slope of his life, he is able to pull a very
steady trigger. Â
The shooting of the Nord Deutschers
began early in the day and was kept up
until almost dark. Th marksmen were
handicapped by a strong, cold wind. There
were plenty of "cash prizes offered. On the
public target fifteen prizes from $2 to $20
were offered for the best centers and fif
teen more for the most centers. There
was a lively competition for the first and
last buliseyes in the morning and after
noon. F. P. Schuster started the pace by
getting the first bullseve soon after the
targets were opened, for which he won
$2 50. Louis Bendel came in for the last
Captain L. Siebe, the Well-Known Rifleman and Proprietor of the Shell Mound
Shooting Range.

went with the shot. * â¢
In- the; afternoon Philo Jacoby lost no
time in getting into a shooting-stand and
his first shot drew out the red Hag and. the
$1 prize.; As the targets closed at 5:30 p. m.
j there was a lively competition for the last
I bullseye and the" $2 30 prize among Bendel,
j Schuster, Jacoby, A. Strecker, H. H. Bur
feind .-: and V William k Glindermann. The
contest â ? narrowed Â down to i Strecker ; and
Glindermann and the latter drew out the
red -;â  Hag two minutes'. before the targets
closed. In all about 3500 shots were fired
by the marksmen. ' Â '
- : In * consequence of .the" large ." number of
shooting tickets sold and, shot it was de
cided not to figure out the prize-winners
until to-night. The distribution will be
held to-morrow evening :at 620 Bush street.
There was an interesting side match fi for
$50 a side. L. Bendel bet with Glinder-
I matin that he (Bendel) would make fifty
| buliseyes I: during / the \ day, . the * buliseyes
j being the three-inch ring in the ring tar-
I get. He shot hard to accomplish the feat.
: and although he made fan excellent total
j he could only reach 36 buliseyes.
The cold wind kept the l majority of the
military - marksmen , away from the range
yesterday. ; However, the first ". gun divi
sion of the Naval Battalion was out in full
force for its monthly medal shoot.': Nearly
all the marksmen who shot yesterday are
young men. Their scores are as follows:^"

AT SCHUETZEN PARK.
Several Clubs Make Good - Scores In a
\-v* ;;.;;â ;.;â : High Cold Wind.
Notwithstanding the raw north wind, a
gdort many sharpshooters shouldered their
rifles and, hied themselves to Schuetzen
: ParK yesterday. ; â¢
The scores made were fully up to- the
standard; and those who put up with the
inconvenience of a chill came home well
satisfied with the result of the day's sport.
The veterans of the California Schuetzen
Club were somewhat nonplussed at the
remarkable good score made by one of
their younprest and latest admitted mem
bers, J. F. Robinson, who made the credit-
able score. of 443 out of a possible 500.
However, this supposedly green recruit is
a guard at the San Quentin Prison and is
known to the officers and convicts a? a
marksman that can kill a sparrow at 1000
yards.
He was a surprise to the. staid veterans,
but as this was his first shoot he was with
out class yesterday, hence his name does
not appear on the schedule of accredited
marksmen, but he will get there by and
by if he continues to bore holes in targets
in such proximity to the 25-mark center.
The competition of the schuetzen sec
tion of the Verein Eintracht resulted as
follows for the monthly medal: Captain
F. A. Kiihls, who had been out of active
practice for the past three years, carried
away the honors of the champion medal

Yesterday ' brought out several dozen
amateur sportsmen, who opened a perfect j
fussilade upon every bird that escaped
from the shooters at the traps. It was al
most a case of sure death to every pigeon

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
A Cold, Windy March Day
Around the Wharves and
on the Bay.
Prince Luiei Bids Adieu to San Fran
cisco and the Cristoforo
Colombo Sails.
March came in, if not like the traditional
lion, still with a sharp, cold wind that
blew : nipping!/ around the wharves and
over the bay. It was as if February, not
satisfied with the leap year "one day
more," was holding on to gain time well
into spring. So the usual crowds that
come down to see the ships were exceed
ingly thin and their stay correspondingly
brier. The water front, seen from a shiv
ering point of view, is not interesting,
and they went home. Â V
However, the second division of the
Naval Battalion, under the command of
petty officer J. Miller, in their boats,"took
a bay excursion down to the six-mile
beach. v = ' ':''.'
The promise of a bie clam-bake drew the
militia mariners out on the raging main
of the bay. The young sailors of. the Na
tional Guard are waiting expectantly for,
their ship to come' in from Mare Island
and are trusting that the millenium, with
its universal peace, 'will not come along
until they get the Comanche in commis
sion and her battery i trained on some
thing. â¢ . . . râ - ...
Yesterday morning early the scow
schooner Coniianza, lying at anchor off
Harrison-street wharf, became restless and
attempted a cruise before being regularly
cleared at the Custom-house. She dragged
her mudhook along the bay bottom until
she fetched up against the schooner John
G. North.
Both vessels bumped, kicked and gored
each other till they were damaged about
the hulls and rigging, and' then started off
together. They got down ; against the
Cristoforo Colombo and were busily de
stroying the iron cruiser when the tug Re
liance snatched the - two warlike crafts
away from their victim.
;. The ship Richard 111 also dragged, her
anchors in the strong tide and breeze and
fouled the sub- bay telegraphic cable be
tween this City and Oakland.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
On the Cuban question the Senate has
led trumps and the House must follow
suit.
There is a time for a vigorous foreign
policy and a time for diplomatic discre
tion.
Hunter and Blackburn are both good
stayers, but there is such' a thing as stay
ing too long. _
If Spain jumps us perhaps Mexico will
kindly tender her friendly offices and pull
off the fight.
Eastern people have figured it out that
every cold wave is followed by big fires,
but the fact doesn't console them any. .
The Post asserts it intended the attack
on the Valley road as irony, but all the
same it had a visible admixture of brass.
As Cleveland has not yet declined a third
term it will be rather risky for Congress to
offer him a chance of a war ready made to
bis hands.
On every question of foreign politics that
arises in these days the country is about
as solid as a cannon-ball and as quick as
powder.
It is noted in the East that bicyclers
have been on the road all winter, and it is
. now announced that cycling is really a
capital cold-weather exercise.
A small boy in Long Island City chal
lenged the Mayor to a civil service compe
tition, and ever since the Mayor has been
laying for a chance to spank him.
It Olney is not a better diplomatist than
Cleveland the Senate may yet regret hav
ing put such a dangerous weapon in his
hand as that of the Cuban resolutions.
It has been more than a week now since
Secretary Morton had his record plowed
up and his feelings harrowed, and he must
begin to feel as if he had been abandoned
to grass.
Massachusetts has at last found some
thing in herself to reform, having come to
the conclusion that the election of a Gov
ernor every year is too agitating for classic
repose.
Senator Morgan declared that Spain
would rather yield Cuba to us than sur
render it to the insurgents, and we are
now going to have a chance to see what
kind of a prophet he is.
Governor Lowndes of Maryland proposes
to reform that State from Democratic mis
management so thoroughly that it will go
Republican in November, and surely that
ambition is both pure and lofty.
The railroad organs charge that the op
ponents of the funding bill are working for
a Vanderbilt sclvme to defraud the Gov
ernment out of $90,000,000, but the charge
has too much bad powder in it and the
shot won't go.
As a writer in the Atlantic Monthly
vigorously demands the election Jof an
ideal President this year the natural sup
position is that Massachusetts has a dark
horse in reserve, but there is no reason to
suspect Olney. '
The coast defense bill before the Senate
should certainly be passed. We have had
much talk of late about our willingness, to
fight for the Monroe doctrine and it is
now time to prepare for what would
happen if we did fight.
The German plan of increasing the navy
for the purpose of extending German colo
nies has the defect that a warship is about
tbe most ineffective colonizing machine on
earth. It may quell the natives, but it can
neither subdue the soil, open a mine, nor
start a trade.
Congress has been petitioned to set apart
the 24th of June as a National holiday to
commemorate the discovery of this conti
nent by John Cabot, but the date is too
near the Fourth of July and would crowd
"the observance of the discovery of inde
pendence by George Washington.
With the demand for river improve
ment, the restoration of hydraulic mining,
the classification of mineral lands, the de
feat of the funding bill and the exclusion
of Japanese products, the California dele
gation alone can give Congress work
enough to do this session without running
off on side issues.
The new bonds are being used by the
National banks to increase their issue of
notes, and already applications have been
made to the Comptroller of the Treasury
for more than $15,000,000 of them, so that
out of the evil of the issue we are to get
some good in the way of an increased
amount of money for circulation.
' The British Embassador at Constanti
nople calls for relief for the suffering
people of Zeitoum, but it was only a short
time ago that the Sultan refused to per
mit Miss Barton to go to Zeitoun. Under
the circumstances, it would seem to be the
proper thing for the Embassador to settle
with the Sultan before he appeals to other
folks. ' , /
The Senate has agreed to a resolution
directing the Secretary of War :to in
quire into the present condition of
the Sacramento River and the cost of re
storing the former, channel. This,, of
course, is not as good as an appropriation,
but it shows that the Government at Wash
ington has learned at last that California
is in the Union and perhaps an appropria
tion will be the next thing.
THE EOAD3 CONVENTION.
The State convention called for to-mor
row to consider the question of good roads
will be one of the most important ever
held in California, as it will not only be
the occasion for an expression of observa
tions and opinions by the State Bureau of
Highways, but a gathering of representa
tives from all parts of the Stale and from
all the interests directly concerned. Its
great educating value will be to inform
the people of the heavy tax which bad
roads impose on their thrift. After that
is accomplished there will arise questions
of main routes and of means for raising
money. The greatest difficulty will likely
be found in convincing the people that
bad roads* are exceedingly expensive.
Farmers particularly are a conservative
class, and strong arguments will be re
quired to show them that money invested
in good roads yields a large profit.
"This desiiable end," says the Baden
Enterprise, "can be best accomplished by
placing before the people plain facts and
figures from reliable sources. The last re
port of the Department of Agriculture
gives some very interesting and instruc
tive data upon this subject. Reports to
the department from 1200 counties show
the average haul from farm to market or
shipping point to be twelve miles, the
avera.ee load for two horses 2000 pounds,
and the average cost per ton per mile 2.5
cents. On the basis of these figures it is
estimated that the cost to the people of the
country is $916, 414,665 per annum, or about
$13 for every man, woman and child in
the United States, and in consequence of
bad roads it is estimated that more than
one-half this vast sum is wasted, or in
other words with good roads more than
$500,000,000 would be saved annually on
transportation to the people of the United
States."
A patent difficulty which must be han
dled with great care is one that the cycling
interests can avoid by the exercise of wis
dom. It is well understood that the move-
ment for good roads has received its
strongest impulse from this source. As
the industrial uses of the bicycle have not
been developed to an extent at all compar
able with its employment for health and
recreation there is a remote danger of an
tagonizing the rural population. And yet
the bicycle would undoubtedly become
one of the most valuable of industrial im
plements, useful to all classes, if the roads
were good. Already it has reduced the
price of common horses to less than half,
and that means a substantial gain to the
farmer. The. demand of the bicycle for
good roads is based on common-sense
principles identical with those which con
cern a farmer's interests. Best of all, the
bicycle does not wear a road to the small
est degree, and is the quickest of all ve
hicles in detecting those faults which are
injurious to wagon transportation. Its
pneumatic tire is sufficient proof to any in
telligent farmer that the proper tire for
wagons is one that not only requires the
least draft power, but that also preserves
the road. It would not be wise to build
fine roads without governing the relation
between the weight of loads and the width
of tires.
The hoofs of horses are a wearing agency
of great importance. On bad roads horses
are necessary, and the cutting done by
their hoofs is a matter of no great conse
quence. Recent inventions in road trac
tion machines point to the time when
draft horses maybe superseded by these
inventions on good roads. That will mean
a great saving in the cost of transporta
tion as well as the maintenance of roads.
AN APPARENT- SUCCESS.
The Gerlach wave motor has been given
a final test at Santa Cruz and the report
comes that it is perfectly successful. If so
something seemingly akin to a miracle has
been done. Two or three hundred yards
north of the Cliff House, on our peninsula,
the curious stranger, inquiring concerning
the meaning of two gaunt, weatherbeaten
and abandoned structures which sur
mount the outer line of rocks, is in
formed that they are the ghostly skele
tons of unsuccessful experiments made
to utilize the power of the waves. If
the stranger is sufficiently inquisitive
he will be informed that this same
power is beinj; quietly and unostenta
tiously employed to furnish the . Sutro
baths with a constant supply of clean
water from the sea and that this repre
sents a great saving to the institution.
The reason that the Sutro arrangement at
tracts no attention is that it is not spectac
ular.
The Gerlach invention, while it shows
no new mechanical principle, utilizes the
force of the waves by an original applica
tion of old principles. The force of the
waves is received by paddles constituting
a segment of an incomplete wheel and
hanging in the water. There are two of
these groups of paddles, side by side, but
they are ingeniously geared to exert an in
dependent force on the connected ma
chinery, which, by reason of this and other
devices, is made to work . with a certain
uniformity. That overcomes the ancient
difficulty of irregularity. It is not likely,
however, that even this approximate ap
proach to the rhythmic action necessary
to useful machinery could have been made
available for industrial uses had not elec
tricity been brought to its present develop
ment. The wonderful thing about elec
tricity is that it instantly responds without
a wrench or injury to variations in the
power which generates it. The wave
motor machines which have failed in the
past were devised before electricity had
been brought to its, present development.
It is now conceivable ! that the simplest
wave motor, including some of those which
were tried and abandoned years ago, could
be made available. This is true particu
larly of machines of any kind for storing
cumulative batteries with energy. It
makes practically no difference whether
these batteries are stored with a regular or
an irregular power, provided the question
of cost is the main* consideration. The
amount of energy stored and ready for use
is the product more of the amount of
energy expended in storing it than of the
character of the energy employed.
There seems to be, reason* to hope that
the Santa Cruz invention is successful, and
this means to say that it should not be
difficult to make a very wide range ;of
wave-power devices that would ; accom
plish a similar result. This should be a
matter of interest to the coast cities of
California. __________________
A EAILBOAD PA-LUBE.
An analysis of the circumstances attend
ing the collapse of the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad shows that the amount of the
outstanding bonds and stocks was greatly
in excess of the value of , the property and
that at the last moment a i desperate ef
fort â¢ was made to avert bankruptcy by in
creasing the burdens that had wrecked
the road. It is the old story of selling
bonds too easily in Europe, of watering
the stock, of carrying an impossible inter
est account and of forcing dividends.
This splendid property has been placed in
the hands of a receiver appointed by, a
Federal court and is added to, the long list
of roads whose direction has passed into
the hands of the Government. â¢".Â¥'.'â 
The great; argument used before the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,. MONDAY, MARCH 2, 1696.
Legislature of Kentucky against the re-,
peal of the Southern Pacific Company's
charter was that it would tend to -shake
the confidence of European money-lenders
in Amerioan securities. A salient draw-
back to the prosperity of the United
States and a vital factor in the maladmin-
istration of American railways is this same
feeling of security that the Legislature of
Kentucky is so zealous to ' uphold. Had
not European capitalists stood ready to
take the second mortgage bonds i of the
Central Pacific (generously and without
any good reason made first mortgage
bonds by Congress) and to take also the
stock which the Central Pacific directors
made themselves a present of as directors
of the Contract and Finance Company and
afterward sold to English money-lenders
at 80 cents, the scandalous danger which
now threatens Congress would never have
arisen.
The English bondholders, whom the.
Government has permitted to. exercise a
prior right over its demands, and the Eng
lish stockholders, who are the successors
and beneficiaries of the Contract and Fi
nance Company swindle, are the ones who
are now sitting in Mr. Huntington's
shadow at the doors of Congress and
clamoring for their "rights" and
"equities." It is their interests which Mr.
Huntington is so earnestly guarding, and
it was their interests and theirs alone that
the Legislature of Kentucky deemed it
proper to protect. When Mr. Huntington
boasts that he has never wrecked a rail
road he is careful to say nothing of the in
fluence which he has exerted to sacrifice
the industrial and political interests of
the United States for the money-lenders
of Europe.
There is nothing wrong in the principle of
borrowing money; the evil lies in its abuse.
No argument recognizing tho great value
of railroads in developing the resources of
the United States can be fairly made with
out considering also the enormous drain
which our industries suffer in the shape of
interest and dividends on inflated securi
ties held in Europe and the invitation
offered by European confidence in Ameri
can securities to create fictitious indebt
edness. As a promoter of that form of
rascality, which the honest public is taxed
to support, this European confidence is
exceedingly powerful. And yet in view of
these facts and in the face of the bank
ruptcy of such a concern as the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad our Congress is
solemnly told that it should refund the
debt of the Central Pacific and so conddne
the wrongs and perpetuate the evils which
its practices represent.
COAST EXCHANGES.
The Visalia Delta notes the fact that
three new manufactories are to be estab
lished there. These are a foundry, a ma
chine-shop and a planing-mill. It further
furnishes complete details of an agreement
between the Visalia and Tulare Railroad
Company (an independent steam road
eight miles in length and connecting, the
two towns) and the city of Visalia for an
extension of the road beyond Visalia to
connect with the San Francisco and San
Joaquin Valley Railroad, and thence, un
der certain contingencies to the Sierra Ne
vada. This may be taken as evidence of
the stimulus to development which the
early advent of the Valley road is exciting.
Another evidence of confidence in the
return of prosperity following the ap
pearance of . the Valley road is
found in Fresno. The Republican of
that city quotes Thomas E. Hughes, "the
father of Fresno," who declares that
"Fresno has more natural advantages
than any inland, town- in the State, and
will have 50,000 inhabitants before ten
years more pass," and to this our con
temporary adds: "The advent of the com
peting railroad will bring the producer
cheaper rates for the transportation of his
products to market and the consumer his
necessities at lower prices. Cheap elec
trical power will revolutionize the possi
bilities of manufacturing, and when that
great factor has been utilized to tbe extent
which will be possible in connection with
the remarkable discoveries constantly be
ing made in its application to all kinds of
industrial progress, Fresno can sustain a
population that will easily approximate
the figures suggested by Mr. Hughes."
New railroad projects in Alameda
County are progressing satisfactorily, ac
cording to the following from the Encinal:
"The franchise which E. P. Vandercook
obtained- from the Board of County Su
pervisors some time since for an electric
road over a route from East Oakland via
Dublin to Livermore, has been absorbed
by the incorporation of the Oakland and
Livermore Valley Railroad Company.' The
capital stock of the new company is fixed
at $3,000,000, divided into 300,000 shares, at
$10 each, and the purpose is to construct a
line that will have its terminus at the Cor
ral Hollow coal mines."
TheWatsonville Pajaronian gives tbe fol
lowing statement of the results accom
plished by the narr ow-gauge railroad and
the sugar beet industry: "The leading in
dustry of this valley is that of sugar beet cul
tivation, and the greatest labor-employing
agency of this city and section is the fac
tory where those beets are processed' into
crude sugar. In connection with the sugar
mill the company operates a narrow-gauge
railroad extending to tidewater at Moss
Landing and continuing down the valley
to Salinas. At Moss Landing , connec
tion is made with Goodall, Per
kins & Co.'s line of steamers, and
through this connection freight to j and
from San Francisco is handled by the
little road. The road gets a considerable
share of the freight to and from San Fran
cisco, but .it should get ; all that can
be delivered that way. It is a local insti
tution, its employes (or rather most of
them) live here, it pays all claims
promptly and at regular times and its
owners have been and are the stalwart
friends of this city and section.' The
policy of the broadgauge line has been
to do all possible against Watsonville at
all times and give its shippers as few con
cessions as possible. The owners of the
little road have paid out millions of
dollars here for material and labor since
the first work was done at the beet fac
tory. The sugar mill has been the main
business prop of the community, it; has
paid all demands in losing as well as profit
able seasons, it has handled all of the beet
crop in foul as Well as fair seasons. It has
stood up to its agreements at all times
without â ; sign of ; renigging. ;In vie w of
all of these circumstances, as well as the
strong local feeling against the owners of
the broadgauge system for the many" blows
they have struck at ' this city and valley,
the freight business of ; this section should
be diverted over the â¢ narrow gauge when
ever possible. r Ii J the company would put
on a daily boat during the berry season it
could work up a big fruit freight business
from this section." -'..â¢ '.'."._"; "â 'â¢/â *-.. :-

taken the Maple, appropriating public prop

HAS SAVED MANY LIVES.
How Billy Sanders Keeps People Fro*
Drowning in the Bay.
The man who Keeps watch over the Clay
street pier at night is known as "Billy" San
ders.: He has been there for ten ; years, and in
addition to his duties as watchman, Billy has
done a great deal of work as a lifesaver. He
has had abundant opportunity, for Clay-street
pier Is open all | night for the accommodation
of those who have business with the Stockton
boats. . Just how many people Billy has pulled
out of the water is more than : ; Billy . can tell.
At first he used to keep count, but for a while
they came so fast he lost track of them, but
knows there must be over a hundred. .
There are three kinds of people rescued from
watery graves by Billy, viz: Would-be suicides,
intoxicated men and > those who accidentally
fall overboard. Those who contemplate sui
cide are the most numerous, however.
It is a lonely job, that of Billy's. There is not
a sound except the gurgling of the water as it
rushes between the piles. Suddenly there is a
splash, and in an instant the watchman is
rushing to the point trom which the sound
proceeds. Perhaps there is a cry of despair,
but Billy don't mind that. He is used to it.
"Billy" Sanders, the Life-Saver of Clay
Street Pier.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.] â 
He simply gets the person located and decides
on the best way to rescue him. If near the
wharf, he fishes for the unfortunate with a
boathook, provided the tide is not too low. If
it is a large man on the other fide of the slip,
he lowers his boat. It it is a woman, he simply
plunges in after her and soon has her safe
ashore.
"Its hard, nasty work," said Billy when
speaking of It tho other night. "There is
nothing brave about it, and I don't get paid
for doing it, but i*. ain't any man's nature to
stand by and'see another one drown. A great
many men would be a deal better off if I let
them go to the bottom, but that of conrse ain't
humanity, and I would do my best to get a
man out no matter how worthless he was."
"This attempted suicide business always
comes in lumps," Billy continued. "That is,
there are always several in a few days and
most of them are women. They come down
here and jump In expecting the water to be
warm and dry. Instead, they find it cold and
wet, and if the tide is very low, mighty bad
smelling. Then they holler and I come along
and fish them out. That is all there is to it."
Billy then went on to explain that most of
the women when rescued were sorry they had
attempted their lives, and a*ked to be sent to
their homes. This was always done. If they
could give no account of themselves Billy al
ways locks them up in a room and sends for
the police. What becomes of them after that
is something he knows nothing about except
what he reads in the newspapers.
In appearance Mr. Sanders is a fine physical
specimen of manhood. He is about 40 years of
age, of medium height, but looks as if he was
all muscle. He is a fine swimmer, and Is al
ways ready to jump into the water to help
those in need of his assistance. He has every
thing about the wharf fixed for life-saving.
His boat is arranged so that he can lower it in
an instant, and he has plenty of ropes and
boathooks where he can put his hands on them;'
In all the years he has been on the wharf less
than half a dozen of the many people he has
attempted to save have drowned before he
could reach them.
Mr. Sanders is very modest about all he has
done, and says, "Oh, that's nothing," just as if
saving a human life was an every-day occur
rence. Many people have thanked him for
pulling them out of the water, but the greater
number have gone away grumbling because
he meddled with them.
THE NEW WOMAN.
A braver, fairer one I have not seen;.
A man in courage and a maid in grace;
In soul a god.

To herald night.

FAVORS LEES.

ENTITLED TO THE PLACE
John Seymour May Be Made the

Department.
THE RIOTS OF OLDEN DAYS.
Two Officers Subdue Sixteen Soldiers
With Two Pickets Torn From
a Fence.
Captian I. W. Lees is to succeed Patrick
Crowley, who resigned as Chief of Police
last Saturday, and John Seymour is to be
come the head of the detective department
Captain I. W. Lees, Who Is Recommended by Chief Crowley as His Successor.
in Lees' place. That is the forecast given
out everywhere the matter is discussed,
and especially in police circles.
Captain Wittman, whose name has been
mentioned in connection with the chief
tainship, stated yesterday that he saw no
reason for the same.
"Captain Lees is the man who is needed
in that position," he said. "He is not
only entitled to it by virtue of length of
service, but for competency. There is not
a thing that has transpired in the depart
ment in the past forty years, nor is there a
communication with foreign police depart
ments regarding police matters, that the
captain is not thoroughly familiar with.
He has everything in this connection at
his fingers' ends, and there is no man liv
ing, excepting the Chief, who could as
sume the enormous responsibility of the
office and do it justice."
Captain Wittman is one of the youngest
men on the force in point of service. He
has only been a year in his present posi-

tion and he has already distinguished him
self.
His judgment is so well : guarded that
he is the one who has been chosen by the
Police Commissioners to make a three
months' tour of the East to study police
methods there so as to > introduce their
best points here when he returns.
It is generally understood, anyhow, that
the recommendation of Chief Crowley as
to who should be his successor in office
will be accepted and acted upon by the
Police Commissioners.
The Chief said yesterday: "I will
recommend to the Commissioners that
they appoint Captain Lees. I do not
know any man who could take charge of
the department with as firm a hand and
with the knowledge of its requirements: as
he can. Ido not think that I could have
torn myself away if it had not been that i
knew Lees was there to take my place." A;
The Chief was very sad as he spoke.
His voice was choked and ; his eyes dim;

on him, and the death of his last boy within
the week has almost unstrung his nervous
system. ' â  -... N -
"This is very hard," he : said feelingly,
"and lam feeling blue." â  "..-
This admission from Chief Crowley,
made in the privacy of his office to a re
porter who has ; interviewed , him almost
daily for the past seventeen years without
getting more than . purely business facts,
is indicative of the tremendous strain un
der which he is laboring.
Well, if the Chief feels blue that color is
nothing as compared to the coloring of his
men's feelings. All alone the line, no
matter on what beat an officer was found
and interrogated, the answer was the
same. . . _
"We'll never get another Chief like
him."
Chief Crowley, from what his men say,
has endeared himself to them as few lead
ers have ever done anywhere. While he
was strict, they say, he was always fair.
They were talking last evening around
the assembly-room at the new City Hall.
They -were old-timers like George Birdsall,
Harry Reynolds, Jim Gillen, Harry Hook,
John Martin and others connected with
the various stations about the city. They
have been in the department for many
years, but the Chief was in it before them
and the force was not so large as to cause
his deeds to be cast about, spread and for
gotten.
They recalled his first claim to distinc
tion when he had been Chief only about
three days. It. was when a quarrel arose
between white men and Chinese at the
corner of Front and Sacramento streets in
1866. With a handful of men on whom he
could depend he rushed in between the
two factions. It was about the time when
the hatred for Chinese labor was budding,
and to take the part of the Mongolian was
almost taking one's life in his hands.
It was shortly after this that Crowley
got the starter for the reputation he has
now of having quelled more riots with less
bloodshed than any Chief of Police in the
world. It was during the railroad troubles
in the Potrero in 1867. Again it was
trouble between whites and Chinese. The
whites outnumbered the Chinese three to
one.
They threw the cars over the embank
ment and burned up the shanties where
the enemy lived. At that time there were
but seventy men on the police force, in
cluding prison-keepers, clerks and non
combatants. Crowley enlisted them all,
but as horses enough could not be hired or
got only thirty reached the scene of con
flict. Those were wild times, and either
good, sound advice. or a good, sound
thrashing had to be administered. The
Chief, riding up in the midst of the 3000
rioters, adopted the milder course.
"Now, look here!" he exclaimed from
the saddle on his horse, attracting the at
tention of the men who were gathering,
"I am Chief of Police, and I don't want
any rioting in this county. If you want
to make trouble I'll get out here and give
you a battle. If you lick me your victory
will only be a short one, and I'll be back
and will give you the soundest licking you
ever got in your lives.
"If you don't - want trouble move on to
your homes when I order my men to
charge."
The order to charge was given, and the
thirty mounted officers cleared away the
3000 rioters in thirty! minutes.
But the most exciting , time the Chief
had was in the : first i year - of â  his â¢ appoint
ment. It seems that even the Goldenson
riot was tame as compared to it. v It was
when little four-year old Mageie Ryan was
assaulted and murdered by a fiend named
Charles Quinn, who was subsequently sen
tenced to life imprisonment at San Quen
tin, and who died there. . The entire City
was wild over the matter. ' Captain Lees
and * the Chief were -- out doing regular
police duty as a patrolman t might *do ' to
day/- v. - ..' â  v :â  . â .
i They captured : the murderer and â¢ were
taking him from the wharf â to the; old
City Prison on Washington : and '' Kearny
streets.' ' The ','.. mob, shouting j and â¢, in
creasing :at every block, â  wanted jto take
Quinn and lynch him, but '- as fast
as . they would ; : approach they ", were
driven back. :' Finally when '; Dunbar,: alley
w as ; reached f and : , the I mo b ? saw the man
escaping from their grasp, they followed
one burly fellow who was ; in the capacity
of a leader. They rushed in to get Quinn.
Chief Crowley let go? the prisoner and
turned on the leader. Bang! .Bang! went
his right and left fists; and the leader and
his first assistant lay prone on the ground.
By this time Captain Lees was doing some
good work. too. He had knocked down
one man and rushed his prisoner into the
jail,"* â  â¢ --'â¢â¢â¢'.
The Goldenson and sandlot riots are
very ; modern ,in comparison ; to the ones
mentioned, but they only added laurels to
Chief Crowley's wreath as a capable gen
eral. * '-â¢ '.â '"'â â¢'â¢'"
Captain I. W. Lees, who is to replace
Chief Crowley, is the oldest police officer
in the United States if ; not in the world.
He is better known than any other man to
the foreign police departments, and as Jan
authority in criminal matters, he stands
pre-eminent. .
Less was a plain patrolman forty-four
years ago in this City. His ; ; courage ' and
astuteness were such that he soon went to
the front. Of course ;he ; had some set
backs, but he overcame them always with
great credit to himself- 1
There is one pleasant incident the old
timers relate about him. It was in ; 1861,
at the beginning of the war. The New
York Fourteenth Regiment. was stationed
out here. These soldiers were eenerally
regarded as the riff-raff of the Federal army,
and it is conceded that the "Bloody Four
teenth," as they were called had earned
the title. >.
Hampton North was City Marshal In
those days, a position equal to that of
Chief of Police. He took umbrage at some
real or imaginary thing that Â« Lees had
done and punished him by a detail out
near the "Presidio. That was â¢; where the
soldiers held out, and it was almost worth
any man's life to go into that neighbor
hood. Lees was undaunted, however, and
he steered straight to the soldiers' resort,
a shady saloon where they spent their
time and money. ''Hamp' T North, as he
was called, was not a bad man at heart,
and he thought he too had better follow
out in Lees' wake, with the dual idea that
he would see if his patrolman did his duty
and also help him in doing it.
Both officers reached there about the
same time, and, as usual, there was a fight
in progress.
There were sixteen men in the battle,
and Lees and North realized their inability
to prevent the melee. All they had was
their revolvers, and they did not feel like
shooting the soldiers down, so they retired
for a consultation.
North didn't know what to do, but Lees
did. He jumped out and tore two pickets
off the fence. One he gave to North and
the other he took and started into the sa
loon.
"Stop that fighting!" he shouted, "or
we'll take every mother's son of you to
jail."
The situation appeared so preposterous
that the soldiers closed in on the two
officers and the fun began. Lees and North
laid out nine soldiers and the others fled
for their lives. The picture of those two
policemen marching in nine badly bat
tered Government soldiers . and locking
them up in the old calaboose was a sight
to behold.
When it was all over North turned to
Lees, put out his hand, and said:
"Shake, I'll never mistrust you again."
It was shortly after that that Lees had
an encounter with a desperate individual
he placed under arrest in front of the old
Pennsylvania engine-house. He was shot
three times, the bullets penetrating the
chest and running along the ribs to the
back.
His battles and shooting scrapes with
criminals since those old times have been
so numerous that it would take volumes
to relate them. Suffice it to say that not
only Lees has shown .himself to be a
Prominent Figures in the Forthcoming Emmet Anniversary Celebration at Metropolitan Hall.

"game" and determined man, but he is re
garded as one of the cleverest detectives in
the world.
John Seymour, who is regarded as the
most likely successor to Captain Lees, has
been on the force about eleven years. One
year of this he was on patrol duty ; two
years he did special work, and during the
past eight years .he has been in the
"upper office" as a detective. He â has
been the companion of Captain Lees all
this time and has the benefit of his thirty
years' experience.
Seymour is a young man, comparatively
speaking. He has a charming family,- con
sisting of a wife and six bright children.
He neither drinks nor smokes, and is a
clever and clear-minded man. â¢?.- :
A RUNAWAY ACCIDENT.
Three People Injured in a Collision on
.Golden Gate Avenue.
'â i: There was a serious runaway accident
on Golden Gate avenue and Franklin
street lato yesterday afternoon which re
sulted in the. injury of three people. J.
Gout and his sister Julia and Miss Annie
Mistreau. who are interested in a laundry
on Larkin street, near Post, attended a
funeral in the afternoon. On their way
back from the Odd Fellows'- Cemetery
their horse became f unmanageable and
ran away; Near the corner of Golden Gate
avenue and Franklin street the buggy col
lided with a' coupe and the three were
hurled to the ground.
. Miss Mistreau was picked up in an un
conscious condition and removed to the
Receiving Hospital. For ; a .; time :it ; was
believed that ; her injuries were of such ; a
character as to prove fatal, but later in the
evening she recovered and was removed to
the French Hospital. : Miss Gout was badly,
bruised ; about the head, body and limbs.
She was sent to the French Hospital with
her friend. Gout's legs were badly, bruised
and ' sprained;^ but % not $so i serious as ?to
necessitate his going to the hospital. The
buggy was badly wrecked. ; A â¢;,'
The other vehicle and occupants had a
narrow escape, t; lt belongs to M. Rosen
thal of ,1410 Fulton street. The driver was
thrown ' from his : seat, but he held to the
lines and was dragged along the ground
for I some distance * before â¢ the reins were
pulled from his hands. At ; this point
Charles Myers of 26 West Mission street

fied animals by the bits and after much
effort succeeded yin 'i bringing ,;â  them 3to " a

The Anniversary of Emmet's
Birthday at Metropolitan ,
Hall.
ARRANGEMENTS ARE ALL MADE
St. Patrick's Day to Be Observed With
" Irish Music, Song and . Oratory :..
at Woodward's.
There was much bustle and excitement
about the Knights of the Red Branch Hall
yesterday afternoon when Irish-American
citizens gathered in large numbers to dis
cuss affairs in relation to forthcoming
celebrations of national . scope and char
acter. The Emmet men were in one hall
while the St. Patrick's day convention
was in progress in another. AH were most
enthusiastic and the proceedings of both
bodies were punctuated with dashes of
sentiments and periods of oratory. The
headquarters generally had the appear
ance of a State political convention in full
blast.-
The Knights of the Red Branch com
pleted arrangements for the observance of
the one hundred and eighth anniversary
of the birth of Robert Emmet, , the bril
liant young Irishman, whom historians
record as a martyr to the principles of
Irish independence. This element of the
Celtic race that has long kept alive the
memory of the young patriot has also
maintained a ceaseless warfare against
England as the hereditary foe of their
native Ireland. â  'â "'.''',
At the meeting yesterday it was decided
to give ex-Congressman John F. Finerty,
who will arrive here on Tuesday morning,
and who will lecture at MetroDOlitan Hall
on the following evening, a rousing recep
tion. Every Irishman of note in the City
will extend the glad hand to the great ora
tor and leader. . Many will leave to-night
for Tracy to meet the coming statesman.
Others will go up to Port Costa in tne
morning. Among the delegates that will
meet Colonel Finerty are the following: .
J. J. O'Brien (chairman), Dr. P. J.
O'Neill, Thomas Desmond, Judge Cooney,
Colonel John o' Byrne, Colonel J. 0.

nan, David Russell. Jeremiah Deasv,
Frank T. Shea, Matt O'Donnell, John T.
Tynan.
Following the K. R. B. meeting the Em
met Council of the Irish National Alliance
held a spirited session. President Thomas
Crowley occupied the chair. Speeches
were made by a number of delegates.
"If it were not 'for the K. R. B. men,"
said Dr. O'Neill, "many would not know
when Emmet was born. It is such organi
zations that keep his name alive. Now,
Mr. Finerty is coming here at our invita
tion. He comes to place the Irish cause
where it belongs. He comes to spread the
doctrine of Irish independence, and every
Irishman should aid in givine him a true
Irish welcome." . .. -
Messrs. . Coniffe, Dolan, Dempsy, Ford,
Hanlon and Crushman were appointed a
committee to receive Mr. Finerty on be
half of the alliance.'
The meeting of the St. Patrick's con
vention .in the afternoon was largely at
tended. Thomas R. Bannerman occupied
the chair. The different committees re
ported everything ' progressing favorably
for the celebration at the new Woodward's
pavilion on March 17. It was decided to
engage Roncovieri's band for the after- 1
noon of St. Patrick's day and Casassa's
Band for the evening. Irish and Amer
ican national airs will be played.. There
will be stereopticon views of Ireland, Irish

THE CANTATA OF ESTHER.
A Highly Successful Entertain
ment by the Children of
Beth Israel.
It Was Given in Celebration of
the Great Jewish Feast of
Purim.
Congregation Beth Israel has good cause
to feel proud, not only of its Sabbath
school pupils, but of its efficient and pains
taking rabbi, who conceived and made
feasible the highly successful presentation
of the drama and cantata of "Esther" at
the Native Sons' Hall last night, in cele
bration of the Jewish feast of Purim.
The large hall was taxed to its utmost
long before the signal was given for the
raising of the curtain. The cast of the
play comprised 112 of the Sabbath-school
children. It consisted of three acts, and
incidentally some very pretty effects were
produced by the Oriental dancing of a
corps of twenty-three children, none over
13 years of age, who showed most efficient
training.
The story of the play is the well-known
one of the threatened destruction of the
Hebrew people of the kingdom of Persia
through the machinations of Haman, and
their preservation by the intercession of
Queen Esther, a Jewess, through whose in
fluence not only were the Jews spared, but
Haman, their arch enemy, was hanged
from the very gibbet he, as Vizier, had
erected for Mordecai the cousin of Queen
Esther. -
Charles Van Vliet made a right royal
King and Tessie Harris a no less modest
and charming Queen, while Herbert Cra
mer took off the villainous part of Haman
with such skill as to evoke hisses from
some of the interested spectators.
In the grand finale came the most enter
taining feature of the production. This
was a special dance by little Adele Morgen
stern and Master ; Abe â  Myrson, neither of
whom had seen more than nine summers.
So well were their efforts to amuse appre
ciated that they were repeatedly encored,
and when they finally. were allowed to re
tire the floral tributes showered upon them
required all their united strength to carry
off the stage.
At the conclution of the performance
Rabbi , M. S. Levy : thanked the audience
for their presence and support and an
nounced that M. J. Waldheimer and Miss
Miriam "B." Levy had won the medals
promised to those who had sold the great
est number of tickets for last night's
entertainment.
Mrs. Waldheimer , sold 590 and Miss
Miriam B. Levy, a daughter of the rabbi,
540.' He also specially thanked Mrs. Louis
Morgenstern; Mrs. Simon Myrson for their
energetic and intelligent work, which
largely aided to make the affair a success.
In concluding, he invited all the children;
of the Sabbath school present, some 300 in
number, to "the banquet f ball, where \ ice
cream, cakes, candies and sandwiches were
provided without stint. . .
It is estimated that the: entertainment
netted about $1000, which will . be used for
the benefit of the Sabbath school. 'M -
AN ARTIST'S SUICIDE.
William H. Byrnes Cuts His Throat
; â¢ With a Small Pocket- Knife While
Despondent.
i â¢ William H. Byrnes, the illustrator and
engraver of 611 Clay street, committed sui
cide yesterday evening. He bad been
financially unfortunate 'of late : and 'â : this
preyed : upon his mind, making * him de
spondent. He had also been drinking
rather heavily. ,
â¢ Yesterday he went to * the home of his
parents at 1939 Lexington avenue, about 9
a. m. He was } perfectly sober, but it was
evident that he was much depressed. : He
was nervous and out of sorts and spoke de
spairingly. * " * "-C * .
Late in the afternoon he went to his old
room and locked the door. An hour later
his father, William H. Byrnes, ? heard a
noise of kicking on the ' floor. \ He tried to
enter the room, but could not. He got no
answer to : his frantic calls, though he
heard a queer gasping souud.
He ran at once for a surgeon. Together
they broke open the door to find the young
artist dead upon the floor, with two great
gashes in his neck and the bloody pocket
knife with which the deed was committed

J. Q. A. HENRY TO LECTURE
Major Ryan's Views on the In
fluence of Romanism in
, Government.
ADVOCATES EXPELLING JESUITS
He Opposes the Use of Public Moneys
for the Building Up of Sec
tarian Institutions.
The announcement that Major T. C.
Ryan of Columbus, Ohio, would address
the Good Citizenship meeting in Metro
politan Hall yesterday afternoon drew a
large crowd together, completely filling
the seats on the lower floor and the gal
lery, with 100 or more persons acting as
â¢ wallflowers.
H.W. Quitzow opened the meeting with
, the following remarks:
Ladles and gentlemen: Despite the cham- |
Dions of the Roman Catholic hierarchy we are
:, assembled here to-day- in advocacy of one of
the greatest principles that has ever agitated
the American people. If sophistry could take
' the place of argument and lies in vulgar lan
guage that of truth then we might say that the
â¢ nineteenth century has not attained that stage
of Civilization which we claim for it.
The opening prayer was delivered by
Â Rev.. Dr. A. M. Russell of Hamilton Square
.. Baptist Church. After the prayer Rev.
Mr. Russell made a few introductory re
marks, in the course of which he said :
Think of the grave problems with which God
. has honored the American people to settle!
He gave them the great problem of civil and
religious liberty to settle, and they settled that
. with. King George 111. Then he gave them the
great problem of human freedom, and America
. came forward and settled that issue; and now
he has honored you Americans by command
â¢ "injryou to go forward In the settlement of a
â¢ question grander still than any of those, and j
that is that the Pope of Rome does not domi
nate this world. Martin Luther, that great j
man who cannot be mentioned without thanks !
and gratitude In our hearts, lifted up the
. standard of liberty and carried it forward, and J
made it easy for us to take it up where he laid j
it down. America is schooling herself, is get
ting ready' to perform this last great act of re
sponsibility so pregnant with iinportehce, not
' only to America but to the whole world. |
. Americans, do your duty and trust in God.
Chairman Qurtzow, with reference to
some past disturbance in the meetings,
â  : said there was plenty of force present to j
"eject any one from the hall who should
dare hiss the American Has:. He then an- i
nounced that Dr. J. Q. A. Henry would de
liver addresses in Metropolitan Hall from I
April 12th to the -oth.
Major Ryan was then introduced, and j
was greeted with prolonged applause. He :'
began by' saying that there were other !
questions of much more importance to the
people than those of free trade and pro- j
"teetion cr the free coinage of silver, and
those questions are whether the institu- â¢
tions handed down by -the American !
patriots shall endure "or whether they i
shall be surrendered into the hands of a
foe that ha 1 * always boen the enemy of
human liberty in every part of the world." !
He did not propose to discuss the question !
of religion at all, for it was no one's busi- i
ness what religion a man practiced, but he
would say to all of. them: ''Never you lay
your ecclesiastical hand upon a single star .
that beams out from these folds of blue. J
That star means religious liberty, and the !
man or the organization thut puts his i
. hand upon that star is a traitor to the best j
government that was ' ever established
among men. â  1
"People say there i 3 no dancer because I
they don't read but one side of the que's- i
tion, and because literature on the other j
side ot the question is not allowed to enter I
the 'homes of the people. In the Young!
Men's Christian Association in Ohio they
will not allow patriotic papers to belaid [
upon- their tables or placed upon their i
files.". â¢ â 
. â¢ A voice â That's so.
"If you investigate this matter a mo
ment," proceeded the major, "you will
call upon God to destroy Romanism and
save the liberties of this people from ever
. lasting destruction."
' The speaker called attention to the ap
pearance of Monsignor Satolli at the
World's Congress of Religions in Chicago
in. 1893 leaning on the arm of Archbishop
-John Ireland of St. Paul. "The climax of
' that .occasion was reached," continued the
: speaker, "when Satolli, with what was
supposed to r>e the Bible in one hand and
the Constitution of the United States in
the other, said; 'Go forward then, with the
book of divine truth, the Bible, in one
hand, and the Constitution of your coun
ter in the other.' He is a magnificent
looking character; possibly you Â«have seen
him. [Laughter.] I have never looked at
a man out of whose eyes beamed more in
telligence. He is a man .of wonderful
"power and ability."
The speaker took up the encyclical of
. November 7. 1885, and quoted the follow
.. ing. which,. he said, appeared in it: "Every
* Catholic should rigidly adhere to the teach
.ings.of the Roman Pontiff, especially in
matters of modern liberty, which, under
the semblance of honesty of purpose, leads
- to destruction."
" "The man who can indorse that," con
tinued the speaker, "ought never to be
â¢'â¢allowed to leave his own dooryard with
out a guide." The speakerobjected to an
â¢ other passage of the encyclical, as follows:
. -."Ail Catholics should exert their power to
cause the constitution of the State in
â¢ which they live to be modeled on the
principles of the true church."
"I can see," added Major Ryan, "what
. Satolli meant when he said 'Go forward
":with-the Bible in one hand and with the
constitution in the other.' Great God!
What is the true church? Is she the
â¢friend of modern liberty or is she opposed
â¢to. modern liberty?''
'â¢'â¢ The speaker charged also that In another
letter in February, 1890, it is laid down
. that Romanists are bound not only to be
lieve what the Pope teaches ex cathedra,
but the must also accept and obey whatso
ever the Pope commands, The major
continued: . . ;,
We will never have peace in this glorious
Republic of ours until we do like other nations
and expel the Jesuits. [Applause.] Italy
poor, down-trodden Italyâ did it, Spain did it,
France did it, Mexico did it, Hungary did it,
Bohemia did it, Poland did it, and every coun
try on earth that is. worthy of the name of
country did it, except America. Germany did
it in 1872 as a remedy for, domestic treason,
and to-day we would have peace in this land
were it not for the Jesuitism that abounds.
This man Satolli was trained by the present
Pope in a Jesuit college, and a Jesuit in the
community is like a boa constrictor lying in
wait for the unwary. I tejl you we will never
have peace in this glorious Republic until we
expel the Jesuits. [Continued applause.]
There are three countries on the face of the
â¢ earth that will never be destroyed by Roman
ism. I have faith to believe that this Repub
lic will endure until Americanism shall be en
thrones!, in every heart. Ulster, that bright
star or - truth in the northern part of Ireland,
' will never surrender to the Pope of Rome
.. [prolonged applause], and Manitoba will come
out from under the shadow of the British
Union Jack before she will allow Popery to de
stroy her school system.
The sneaker went on to say that when a
. few years ago Terence V. Powderiv pre
sidea over a labor convention the first
business transacted was the reading of a
letter from Cardinal Gibbons in which the
Cardinal informed the organization :
That so long as It was under the control of
those who are 'not opposed to the church it
should receive the sanction of the church and
'. its blessing. When Delegate Lewis wanted, to
"know by what authority any ecclesiastical
power should inject itself into a convention of
â¢ men that labored to make an honest living he
was immediately In the midst of a howling
mob, ami the same snakes that now infest the
country hissed him while, lie tried to defend
liberty, and from that day to this they have
hounded William T. Lewis until at times- they
have driven the man to the brink ot insanity.
I agree with the Boston, divine who prayed
.. God that the word religion should, be stricken
from the calendar, and that in its stead should
be substituted the word "Christianity,".; for
religions and Gods are many, but there is only
'.. one true God and one true Christianity.
The speaker declared in his peroration
that , there were 143 men in the Lower
House of the American Congress who
have sworn that not one cent of the
people's money shall go for the propa
gation of sectarianism. "When the
proper time comes," he added, "we will
cut another artery of Romanism."
LECTURE ON ROMANISM.
Major Ryan's Subject, "Romanism
and Protestantlsm-Thelr Fruits
Compared."
The attendance in the evening had fallen
off somewhat. After introductory remarks
by C. T. Brewer, secretary of the State A.
P*. A., Major Ryan was introduced and
was received with literally a storm of ap
plause.
The major began by speaking of tbe tree
of American liberty planted in Massachu
setts in 1620. He said:
I see here In one branch the red hand of
anarchy: on another branch the Irish flag, ana
on the- central branch of the tree I see the
Papal flag. These three flags are enough to
poison liberty unto death. In the heart of the
tree in Washington, the capital of the country,
I see the Papal Ablegate. The city,;the county,
the State ant? the National governments are
reeking with the blood of rum, Romanism and
rottenness.
After the applause which greeted this
remark had subsided Secretary Brewer
came to the front and said:
Major Ryan is evidently not well acquainted
here, or he would have known that the people
you riter to beat them all for patriotism.
Why, sir, the Y. H. I. floats our flag from their
building. When their churches are being
dedicated the stars and stripes float high in
tne air. When one of the priests has occasion
to go to Rome he cannot eat or steep or rest
until he gets back, because he cannot live
without the stars and stripes.
After some musical numbers Major Ryan
then proceeded with his lecture on the
subject, "Romanism and Protestantism;
Their Fruits Compared." It bore upon
the educational systems of the Catholic
Church as contrasted with those -of
Protestant countries. The speaker was
frequently interrupted with applause.
"1 TOLD YOU SO."
The Rev. Dr. Case Reviews the
Famous Ross-Yorke Con
troversy.
Preliminary to bis sermon Rev. Dr. Case
of the Howard-street M. E. Church last
evening devoted a few minutes to the
Ross-Yorke controversy.
"I told you so," he said. "It is mean to
say it, but I told you so." Continuing Dr.
Case said :
I said In the temple that Mr. Ross would
find the priests to be like the agent's descrip
tion of the tile-laying machine:
Wlg?le in and wiggle out.
Leaving the people still in doubt
Whether the thing that laid the track
Is gcing through or coming back.
I said you may label those priests with
language of a signboard or a cabinet-shop,
"All kinds of twisting and turning here. "
We have had many illustrations of the
wiggling, and as to the twisting and turning
they have done little else during the whole
controversy.
Mr. Ross has done splendid work. We are
proud of his achievement. He has made out
nis case so perfectly that no tricks of priests or
Bishops can weaken its force. Mr. Yorke
flunked out completely. He has made one
failure after another until it would seem he
would want to hide nis face for shame and
confusion. He has tried to make out that
Peter was at some time in Rome, and has
failed completely. He has tried to make out
that Peter was a Pope, and has failed. He has
tried to defend the horrible practice of auricu
lar confession, and has failed. He has tried to
destroy the force of my quotations from Hooker
and failed. He has tried to bolster up the
wicked dogma of the infallibility of the Pope,
and hiss failed. He lias tried to answer my
â  quotation from Jesuit Gnry, and has fnile-.f
I will refresh your minds with those quota
tions; I read, from "The doctrine of the
Jesuits" by Gory, on object and subject of the
law, page SO.
Questionâ Are ecclesiastics obliged to obey the
ivil law?
Answerâ No: not the laws In force which are
contrary to their profession or to their sacred
canons.
Ferdinand de Castro Palao said no less clearly:
"An ecclesiastic, as such being . exempted from
the lry jurisdiction, it follows certainly that he
cannot be condemned by a lay judge."
Again on page 79:
Spiritual power is independent of temporal
things; but it lets them operate before they were
united, provided they ere not an obstacle or are
not necessary to the spiritual end in view. For if
there Is at times a resemblance the spiritual
power can and oucht to repress the temporal one,
by all means and expedients which it 'judges to be
necessary. It has the right to transform king
doms, to take them from one and give them to
another, as a sovereign spiritual prince, if this is 1
necessary to the salvation of souls.
lr. is not permitted to Christians to tolerate an
inride! or a heretical king if that king tries to lead
j his subjects Into heresy or Infidelity:. out it Is to
â  the sovereign pontiff who has the care and the
charge of religion that belongs the right to judge j
,if the king leads or not into heresy It is the
sovereign pontiff who should judge If the king
must be deposed or not.
From page 100:
Permission to read, print or publish books con
trary to the Christian faith and manner must
never be given.
Questionâ Must such books. If borrowed, be 1
given back to their owners?
Answerâ No; unless some great inconvenience
be feared. * * There is a grave Incon
venience in quarrels, blasphemies, hate and ot >er.
'similar things which are to be feared from the.
owner. A slight contrariety or the fear of losing)
his friendship is not most of the time a sufficient
reason.
Page 108, on Relation with Heretics:
I.eocadle, a nun, a hospital nurse, where Catholic
and heretic patients are received, is requested by
Quirinus, a very sick Protestant, to send for a min
ister of his sect in order to receive from him the
consolations of religion. .Leocadie does not know
If she must obey.
Questionâ May Leocadie send for a Protestant
minister?
Answerâ It Is evident that she cannot ; that
would be communicating with heretics in a relig
ious case, and co-operation also.
Page 187, Treatise on Justice and Right:
Questionâ May we take some of the property of
another, not only to help one's self, but also others?
Answerâ Yes, according to the common opinion;
because, in a way, one substitutes himself for the
indigent and shows by the act that one loves his'
neighbor as himself.
Q.â ln case of extreme need, or nearly so.
whatever may be the cause of it, can we steal an
object of great value or a large sum, if we are in
need of it? -'^F a f_BftB I, f*fflÃwiH}"''illlFJ *" A aftTWfff?FÃ
A.â There are two opinions; the first one an
swers no: the second one, more probable and more
common, answers yes, provided the rich one is not
brought by that theft to an equal needful situation
and the poor one takes only what he needs.
Rev. Mr. Case further reviewed the re
sults of the controversy and then turned
to bis sermon to young men, entitled,
"Wrecked While Crossing the Bar."
DR. YORK'S LECTURE.
The Noted Liberal ist Argues for Entire
Secular Freedom of Thought and
Belief.
Dr. J. L. York spoke before a large audi
ence at Scottish Hall last evening, hi? sub
ject being "Fair Play." He spoke of the
"great religious conspiracy" ana against
the proposed amendment to the Federal
constitution. .He also contrasted "Chris
tian A. P. A.-ism" with "Liberal A. P. A.
ism." He spoke substantially as follows:
We have fallen on peculiar times and are in
the midst of a great religious conflict and con
spiracy. And not only Is Romanism the enemy
of free thought, free speech, free schools and
parental freedom, but : there is also a wide
Protestant religious . conspiracy, increasing
each year in volume, against the common lib
erties of the people guaranteed. by the consti
tution of our country in the attempts to enact
and enforce Sunday laws and other religious
legislation under the plea that this is a. Chris
tian country. This Protestant Christian cru
sade to make this a Christian country may be
seen in tho attitude of the. National Reform
Association and at least a dozen other Protest
ant societies organized for the special purpose
of amending the constitution of the United
States in the following terms:
"We, the people of the United States/ humbly
acknowledging Almighty God as the source of
all authority in civil government, the .; Lord
'Jesus Christ* as the ruler among the nations,
the Bible his revealed will as the supreme law
of the land, in order to constitute a Christian
government," and in the interest of justice and
fair play toward the Catholic faith, as well as
in the interest of; truth, we propose to show
that the Protestant Christian church, some of
whose ! members and 5 preachers have been so
bitter and extreme iv their attack on. the
mother church, need to divide their attention
and have one eye on the Protestant church in
their idiotic movement and attemptiat suicide.
Â»- This proposed Christian amendment to our
constitution, as published in the Christian
Statesman, would eliminate all j democracy
from our Government and disfranchise all un
believers and infidels, in this country. : The
spirit of this holy reform association you may
catch from their published statement, as fol-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 2, 1896.
Ira D. Sankey, the singing evangelist who as a co-worker for years with
Dwight L. Moody obtained international reputation. He is now making a tour of
California for his wife's health and will sing here next Friday and Sunday even
ings at the Y. M. C. A. auditorium. v
lows: "This is a Christian country, and, be
lieving that without Christianity we perish,
we must maintain by all right means our
Christian character and inscribe this character
on the constitution of our country and enforce
upon all who come among us the laws of
Christian morality."
Another Protestant conspirator against re
ligious liberty is the American Sabbath Union,
a powerful organization for the enforcement of
Sunday laws and religious legislation, and to
rob the people of their natural right to hold
the Sunday as thcv might elect, for rest, pleas
ure or recreation. "Romanism has never offered
to deprive the people of a little harmless sport
on Sunday, and it was this association of pinch
beck Protestant Christians that by unjust
methods induced Congress to violate the con
stitution in the passage of a law closing the
World's Fair at Chicego on Sunday, the only
day the poor man and his family could attend,
and are now trying to aggregate political
power at Washington to pass a National Sun
dav law of the most puritanical characterâ
and stamps this Protestant Christian associa
tion as a tit companion for the Spanish inquisi
tion, and we are quite sure that American
Catholics have done no worse than this against
the liberty of the people.
To my mind there is nothing more clear than
that all of the Christian sects are being drawn
into a religious, conspiracy against free
thought, free speech and secular government,
and are drawing nearer to Rome every year.
Ana in this City. where political anti-Roman
ism has made such a stir with the A. P. A dur
ing the past two years, only a tew of the Prot
estnut clergy arc "in any la'rse degree in svni
pathy with the A. P. A. movement. Why Is it
that Protestant preachers protest so feebly
against Rome? Simply because blood is thicker
than water. She is their mother and her blood
runs through every Christian sect which, fit
the best, is only diluted Romanism. And the
time is near at hand when the Protestant sects
will cease to fight old mother, and when every
sect that l/ears the name of Christian will join
in an alliance to defend theircommon creed
against the skepticism of this age of science,
reason and common-sense, which is burning
np the paganism of Christian theology, retir
ing the priest and bringing the schoolmaster
to the front more and more as the years go on.
We are glad that the fundamental law of our
land does not recognize the Brahmin, Bud
dhisi, Egyptian, Hebrew. Mohammedan, Chris
tip.n or any other gods or religions. We, are
glad to know that, la a religious sense, this is
not a Christian Nation, nor in any sense is our
Government based upon the Christian religion,
And in proof of this we cite the reader to the
statement of George Washington in his first;
treaty with Tripoli, that the Government of
these United States is not built upon thÂ» Chris
tian religion, nor was it so considered by Jef
ferson, Franklin and Paine, but it is secular
and free, and snows no religion, save the eter
nal principles of justice, equality and libortv.
A Protestant authority says "that whenever
the Roman Catholics are willing to co-operate
with the Christian sects to resist political ntlie
ism and irreligion we will gladly join hands
with them in making this a Christian country.
And as liberals we are utterly opposed to, and
protest against the God in the constilu tion;
Sunday law and Bible In the school movement
on the part of Protestant Christians, So also
we are not in sympathy with the fervent hatred
of that sort of A. P. A.-ism known as the J. Q.
A. Henry stamp, who in a discourse in this
City last year on the perils of our Republic
stated 'that the greatest peril to the life of this
Republic was secular free thought, liberalism
and a disbelief in the Christian religion.' This
shows the affinity .of superstition? and that
blood is thicker than water. And in one
breath this zealous gospel hater of Rome
would exhaust his vocabulary of vituperation
against Catholics, and in the next breath de
nounce free thought and liberalism, the only
thing that has made possible his freedom of
speech.
And at the same time, while ranting against
the reunion of church and state, declared him
self In favor of the Bible in our free schools,
and signed a petition in favor of Sunday laws
to keep liberals from desecrating the Sabbath.
Wear(notin sympathy with such inconsist
ent, bigoted shystering, narrow-gauge Chris
tian A. Aism as this but for twenty-five
years nave stood, as we stand to-day. in favor
of a broadgauge, consistent American protec-

I tion for our free Institutions against all eccle
| siastical encroachment, whether Roman or
i Protestant, upon the state and schools of our
! country. We can't afford to swap off Roman

: A Roman Pope is quite as admissible as a Bap
tlst or Presbyterian Pope. But we prefer to

i And the attitude of liberals on the subject of
God in the constitution of the United States,
I Sunday laws and the Bible and religious usage
in the free schools has been for many years a
standing protest, and at almost every session
of Congress the liberals of America have sent
| in their petition of protest against the passage
; of the bill of religious amendment to our or
i game law, and the unanimity of sentiment
i among liberals in this City on this subject was
obvious on last Sunday night in oar audience
in securing 400 signatures to defeat the re
i ligious bill before the present Congress. .
] This Protestant' movement to infuse religion
i into the state rests upon the claim that this is
a Christian country, and they argue that our
Federal constitution is a godless document
and must be amended. They claim that this
is a Christian Nation simply because we have
chaplains in army, navy, Congress, Leglsla
tuns, hospitals and prisons; the exemption of
church property from taxation; the Bible and
worship in our schools; the appointment of
fast und feast days by the official authority of
the state; the name of God on our coin,
And Protestant Christians claim that these
long-continued Christian usages mate this a
Christian country. And that our constitution
; being purely secular is detective and must be
! amended, as it gives liberty to all religions
and treats all alike, but indorses no religion,
And when such brainy men in this Protestant
* movement as Rev. Jonathan Blanchard, Rev.
I - vlr - Edwards, Rev. Mr. Tynp. Rev. A. A. Minor
: and scoies of able men in the pulpit and lead
ers of the various so-called reform assoeia
tions, speak out, they are entitled to a candid
'â  and respectful hearing. These people are in
i dead earnest, and their success means the de
i struction of our guarantees of freedom and the
subversion of American liberty. And we meet
them by affirming that this is not a Christian
country; that our Government is not Chris
i tian nor anti-Christian, nor Jewish, nor Mo
. hammedan, but simply secular, with equal
i rights to all and special privileges to none;
and that these religious customs and, usages
' now practiced in our Mate schools and Na
tional Government should : cease, and thus
conform our usage in every department of our
Government and schools to the constitution of
j our country as it is in letter and .spirit.

Christianity or any other special religion: that our
entire political system shall be founded and ad
ministered on a purely secular basis: and that
whatever changes shall prove necessary to this
end . shall .be consistently, unflinchingly and
promptly made.
And as liberals, organized on the nine de
mands of liberalism, we ask that our entire
political system shall be administered on a
purely secular basis. The reasons are many
and obvious, when we consider how wide
apart are the realms of church and state, and
that the state is simply a realm of force, while
that of the church and religion is purely a
realm of persuasion. And the history of re
li, 'ion mall the past shows that any religion
that, reaches beyond Its ; natural limit and is
picked by civil power becomes a cruel despot

PADEREWSKI`S FAREWELL
The Baldwin Theater Could Not
Contain All Who Went
to Listen.
AN OVATION FOR MARSICK.
The Great French Violinist Received
With Tumultuous Applause by His
First Local Audience.
Long before the celebrated Paderewski
struck his first note on the piano at the
Baldwin Theater last night the vocal
music at the box office had begun. No
seats could be bought, not even standing
room was to be obtained, and hundreds of
disappointed people felt very much inclined
to discuss the matter with the ticket
agents, the doorkeepers, the police and
each other.
The men and women who could not get
into the. theater,' though': they offered pre
miums and supplications, would have
formed a fair-sized audience on an ordi
nary occasion.
Even before the audience was seated
only the central aisle could bo kept open.
Then that became jammed and for several
minutes there was good-natured confusion
among the people trying to get to their
seats. "Go through the center," suggested
an usher to a stout man when both seemed
helplessly stalled. But a Berkeley foot
ball eleven could not have gone through
the center at that time.
It was one of the biggest audiences ever
known at the Baldwin and a large propor
tion of those present were people of musi
cal knowledge and critical tastes.
Marsick made a decidedly strong im
pression on his hearers. He was enthu
siastically applauded at every number. A
man of excellent appearance on the music
platform, he wears his hair in a way that
gives a suggestion of the Paderewski glory.
This violinist is to give a recital at the
California Theater next Friday evening,
and on Sunday evening be and his orches
tra will give a concert at the Baldwin. On
Saturday night he will appear at the Mac
donough Theater, Oakland, and on Tues
day night, March 10, at the Auditorium
Theater, San Jose.
At tbe PaderewsKi-Marsick concert last
night Frederick Warde, the tragedian, was
in one of the boxes, accompanied by his
son and two other members of his com
pany. Other parties in tne boxes were:
Samuel M. Shortridge, D. M. Delnias and
Colonel Trumbo and Alfred Bouvier, Mrs.
Bouvier. Mrs. Hagan and Mr. and Mrs. G.

MARSICK'S MUSIC.
How the French Pianist Played
and the Reception He
" Received.
The local patrons of , art have heard
within the precincts of their own City the
following virtuosi of more or less renown
on both continents: Violinists Wieniawski,
Wilhelmj Sarasate, Sauret, Yasye, includ
ing the lesser lights Ole Bull, Remenji,
Litchenburg, Paul- Jullien; Camilla Urso,
OvideMusin; and Pianists d'Albert, Pach
mann, Jesseffy, Ketten, Adele , Aus der
Ohe. Gottschalk, Madame Essipoff, Mrs.
Arabella Goddard. and ; other artists, and
all have met with their share of substan
tial success here.

These selections constitute! the pro
gramme of last evening, the, first num
ber being Paderewski's original composi
tion, a sonata for piano and violin, which
was rendered in an incomparable style.: Its
initial interpretation in this town by these
artists was anxiously : and â ; appreciatively
listened to ' : by : local . professional ' and
amateur musicians and / generously, ap
plauded throughout.
. The sonata as a whole can best â¢be i com
pared as belonging to the. school interven
ing from Beethoven . to Mendelssohn, the
"allegro con fantasio" being both weird :
and reminiscent.: The 'â â¢ intermezzo was
very dainty, especially the run-in' thirds,
which Paderewski : did in ; his : inimitable
way. The finale is on the order of j, the
Kruetzer sonata, but more on the Egypt
ian style.
In the concerto in D minor, by Vieux
temps, r Marsick's 'â  intonation ; was ; not . as
perfect in the adagio movement nor was the
expressiro quite up to the standard. 7 The j
finale showed :. a j good : technique of â  the
French school," but a weak tone.
As an encore Marsick played the adagio
pathetique:by; Goddard, wherein he also
showed a lack of virility. . , * ','â '
. Marsick was heard to best advantage in 5
the i' Polonaise: by :?Lanb;\ to", which -.as an
encore a Wieniawski mazurka was : given.'
: He rendered an adagio of hia own: com
position to which he gave a scholarly in- :
terpretation,' and": which bids fair/to I be
come Ja^verylpopular/rriorceau;^ In ;; the
well-known piece, "Airs Russes,", , by the
erudite .Wieniawski, Marsick again .exhib
ited his facile and non-vigorous execution.
The audience as usual displayed a dispo
sition to applaud the, melodious strains of
an adagio movement. 'â '.'â

The First Two Months of 1896
â ? t Give Promise of a Good
Year.
EFFECT OF TORRENS SYSTEM.
I Heavy Loans Made at 6 Per Cent.
Releases, Auctions and Cur
feifiEjO^ rent Notes.
The second month of the year 189G has
closed and real estate men in a reminis
cent mood appear to be favorably im
pressed with the results of January's and
February's business. One view of the pres
ent situation is that though the market
still remains quiet, yet it is in as satisfac
tory a condition as other lines of trade,
but no decided improvement may be ex
pected until it comes with the general re
vival, of commerce and manufactures.
This is held to be conservative to a last de
gree, and other opinions, which prevail
among a large proportion of the real estate
agents, are more hopeful.
It would seem that the outlook for the
market is very fair, and that indications
for the spring movement point to an im
provementânot at any special advance in
prices, but simply this: Buyers have more
confidence to purchase City lands and
sellers are more reasonable in their de
mands than formerly. Money, too, is
freely loaned on real estate at (I 1 .; and 7 per
centum, and some private lenders are put- ,
ting out money at 6 per centum.
One prominent agent said he was well
satisfied with the results of the first two
months of 1896, his sales in which, includ
ing auctions, amounted to $600,000. These
transactions were not confined to large ;
properties, but there has been a steady de
mand for average priced dwelling lots in
nearly all parts of the City, and also for
cheaper lots in the outskirts where the
street work is done. A factor vnich has
impressed itself upon agents is that street
â work is a really important feature in trans
actions in outside lands. In fact it is very
essential to the successful handling of lots
in outside districts that the streets be fin
ished.
In the City real estate is in better shape
than it was a year ago, although the healthy
upward tendency is gradual.
â¢ The more important loans made on real
' estate during the week were as follows:

The following information on the Tor
rens system of land registration which is
attracting the attention of real estate men
in all parts of the country is taken from the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch of February 16:
â  In effect the Torrens system of registering
land titles is in the form of a set of books,
the title of the land appearing as credit and all
mortgages, contracts or incumbrances appear
against it. With the system in force is it pos
sible to make a transfer of the title in a few
minutes and at a minimum of expense. The
entire system is designed to be as simple as
possible and an effort is to be made to avoid
confusing technicalities which may have the
effect of clouding a title to property. : The
forms of application for registration are all
given concisely in the law and all points
wnlch experience or the knowledge of real es
tate owners and lawyers have suggested in it.
Under the old system and that which is now
in common use, the first move made is to ob
tain an abstract of title which may or may not
carry with it a guarantee from the abstract
company.: This abstractis supposed to include
all documents from the time the possession of
the^ property passed from the State or the
. United States down to the time when it went
into the possession of the present owners.' The
' . cost of this may run from a few dollars well up
into the hundreds. This must then be exam
. ined sad passed upon by the attorney for the
prospective purchaser. When this is done the
owner may. find some technical cloud which
will deter him from making the purchase, and
all the money has been expended to no good.
The cost for abstracts of title and examina
tions by attorney may and often do run up
into the thousands.
Under the Torrens law as passed the Regis
trar Is entitled to charge $15 for the first ex
amination made and the issuance of the cer
tificate. This includes the charge for the ex
amination by the attorneys in the employ of
the Registrar. While for five years a title is
liable to attacks, after the expiration of thai
time the : title becomes good and it cannot be
gone back of. â¢ â -â -Â . x .
â â â  The saving of time and trouble Is one of the
principal, features of the Tonens system.
Under the registration system an absolute
.title is secured in a few minutes' time by call
ing on the Registrar and securing a copy of
the page of the register devoted to this par
ticular piece of property. The expense is
smalL being merely the fee necessary to have
â¢ this examined by a lawyer to ascertain its
legality, a* a certificate of the Registrar carries
with-it. after the expiration of the live years
period, an absolute title to the property. â â 
A sample of the way the system expedites
business is shown in the case of a loan made
upon property in Chicago February 11. It was
the first which came up under the new. system
in Chicago. Mrs. Ellen E. riobbs. by her agent,
had- made application to the Recorder two
weeks previously for a certificate of title to cer
tain property. Ten days must elapse - under
the law between the time of the application
and the issuance of the certificate. ? ihe ten
days having more than elapsed the certificate
of title was issued at 1:30 o'clock in the after
noon of that day. In ; less than \ two hours the
agents of Mrs. Hobbs had secured a loan of
$8000 oh the land from a loan agent: At A .10
" o'clock a trust deed to .the land was filed and
. the whole transaction was complete. In fifteen
minutes more the record of this trust deed had
been taken, the account was closed. and the
business brought loan end. The entire cost
for the certificate wess2l 50, and this included
.an abstract filed with the deed. â¢
."The mortgage, lien, charge or lesser estate
than a fee simple shall not be registered, un

â  "It shall not be an objection to bringing land
under this act that the estate or interest of this
applicant is subject to any outstanding lesser

lesser estate, mortgage, lien or charge shall be
noted upon the certificate of title and the du

the title or interest certified shall be subject

One of the features of the law which is
highly commended is the exception made in
favor of the owner of the piece of property as
opposed to the holder of a tax certificate or
tax deed. As first proposed before the Legisla
ture no objection was made regarding tax
titles. Complaint was made as to this and the
bill was changed. As the law was enacted it
provides no title derived through a tax sale,
or a sale for special assessment shall be enti
â¢tled to be first registered unless the appli
cant can prove to the Registrar that he has
been in undisputed possession of the property
for at least tea years and that he has paid all
taxes and assessments for seven years in suc
cession.
The cost of registering land is materially re
duced to the big owner by a provision of the
law which stipulates that one application may
cover all property in auv one county. \ .
In the event of the giving of a mortgage,
lease or contract affecting a title to the prop
erty, or the selling of an undivided interest in
the property, this fact is noted upon the Reg
istrar's book, and is also noted upon the cer
tificate in the possession of the owner. Dupli
cate certificates may be obtained where one
is lost.
The fees which the Registrar is allowed to
charge are as follows: For filing application
for first certificate, $15, except where the title
is derived from more than one source, in
which case an additional $5 for each source
may be charged: i for granting certificate of
title and registering the same, $2; for register
ing each transfer, including all instruments
connected therewith, and the issue and regis
tration of the new certificate of title, $3.
One of the important features of the Toirens
system of land registration as provided in the
law passed by the Illinois Legislature is the
building up of a guarantee fund. On each ap
plication made for registering land titles the
Registrar makes an assessment of one-tenth of
l.per cent upon the valuation of the property.
This money is paid into the County Treasury.
Opposition to the bill was strong on the part I â¢
of attorneys in Chicago at the time the bill was
pending before the Legislature and after its
passage. For the most part, however, those
who have looked into the system have ex
pressed themselves strongly in" its favor. Mem
bers of the Real Estate Board were a unit in
favor of its adoption.
The Torrens system of registering land titles
has been in use in Australia for more than
forty years, and in Holland and otheT conti
nental Europe countries for more than two
centuries. Wherever it has been in operation
it has proven successful, though there are
some who believe a change from the old sys
tem will" prove extremely difficult. A . mod
ification of the system has deen embodied in a
bill which is now before the Xew York Legisla
ture. So far Cook County is the only county
in the United States where the Torrens system
of land registration is in operation.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 2, J 89G.
TROUBETSKOI`S ROMANCE
The True Story of Amelie Rives
Chanter's Russian
Prince.
HIS FATHER WAS AN EXILE.
The Husband of the American Author
ess Does Not Visit the
Russian Court.
When Amelie Rives Chanler, the
author of "The Quick and the Dead,"
-; PRINCE TROUBETZKOI.
came to San Francisco a few months ago
she was on the verge of shaking off the
matrimonial shackles that bound .her to
Mr. Chanler in order that she might
enter the bonds of matrimony again with
Prince Peter Troubetskoi.
. Mrs. Chanler having secured her di
vorce the Prince . crossed the seas and
married her. The Eastern papers not only
chronicle all the young man's achieve
ments, but they contain roseate accounts
of his numerous and noble connections
and describe in detail the high standing
the Troubetskcis occupy at the imperial
court of Russia.
It is an odd coincidence that not one of
the enterprising chroniclers has assigned
any reason for the fact that Prince Peter
Troubetskoi and his brothers never go to
Russia; have never been there, and that in
spite of the high standing the family occu
pies at the imperial court the young men
who bear the name in Ital^ have no coun
try and no nationality.
"Behind these facts lies a romance of the
order that Ouida delights to honor. It in
cludes a tale of love that came too late, of
imperial wrath and vengeance, of a broken
hearted wife, and of the Jong, slow suffer
ing that sometimes comes to a man as
punishment for a moment's folly.
The Troubetskois - are a very great fam
ily. In fact, the blood of the imperial
Romanoffs runs in their veins, but Prince
Peter is shut off from his imperial connec
tions by a bar sinister, which also shuts
him off from claiming his Russian nation
ality, though in momenta of irritation,
when the tierce old Prince, his father, was
chafing in Italian exile, he used to
threaten to send his sons to Russia to tight
as common soldiers in the army of the
Czar.
The romance began some thirty-seven
years ago. Prince Troubetskoi, a man who
PRINCESS TROL'BE 1
stood high at the imperial court of Russia
and was a distant cousin of the Czar, was
traveling for pleasure in Italy, when
he met a charming American singer,
whose warbling a few years later caused a
local chronicler, to describe her as "the
canary-bird of the Lago Maggiore!" The
Prince was married to a lady of wealth,
who was a near enough connection of the
imperial family for the great father: to
resent any wrong done her, but ; the Rus
sian nobleman forgot all ; this while he
basked in the smiles of the singer. if.'.:''
News ;of the attachment came to . the
Czar's ears and he commanded his subject
to return home on pain of imperial
displeasure. Tho infatuated Prince failed
to comply. The summons was repeated,
and still the Prince came not. Then the
Czar, in his wratn, exiled the forgetful
husband, and - to make * his ? punishment
more bitter he ordered that he should not
be granted a divorce in .Russia. ; Most of
the Prince's wealth bad come to " him
through his wife, and . the Czar saw to it
that ho should touch none of this. Out of
his own property the -Prince was allowed
what to a man of his extravagant tastes
was a mere p ttance, and he was told that
he never need set foot in Russia again ; in
fact, he ; was made grimly to understand
that Siberia would be his portion if he did.
He comprehended too well and remained
in exile till his death. â Â»
It was' near Pallanza, on the Lago Mag
giore, where Prince Troubetskoi had taken
a villa, that : the ' fiance of Amelie Rives
Olianler ; saw the . light of day. ;In due
time the Russian wife died, and the Prince
married , his â  "canary-bird of the w Lago
Maggiore." The exiled Russian 'was not
a happy man. He regretted the fleshpots
of St. Petersburg * and ; Moscow, and when
a sullen fit was on him he 'made life any
thing but a bed of roses for his tamiiy.
In company the Prince had ; the manners
of a Chesterfield, but 'people who are now
men and women, and who ' were i brought
up in the neighboring villas to the Tfou
betskois on the lago, can. tell curdling
tales of the biting sarcasms and taunts
that the old Prince used to treat his sons
to when a black fit of , dissatisfaction was
on him. Sometimes he threatened to send
them to Russia and let them tramp over
the steppes in a line regiment. At other
times. he reminded them that they had
been born in Italy and owed military ser
vice to King Humbert. "I will inform the
authorities that you cannot shield your
selves under the cloak of being Russians,"
he would say. "You shall be made to
serve." This taunt would never fail to
rankle, for the two eldest sons had the
greatest horror of doing military service. >"
When the young Troubetskois started
in life they did not have the title of Prince
inscribed on their visiting cards. Peter
and " Paul got ' round the question -of
whether they could claim the title or not
by having a coronet engraved on their
cards and their unadorned names â  be
neath. After the old Prince's death,
ever, his sons laid claim â¢ more boldly to'
the title of Prince, ignoring the bar- sinis
ter entirely, and Italy is so far away from
Russia that no one disputed their claim. ',
It is greatly . to the young, men's credit
that they have made ttieir own way in the
world.; The Milanese aristocracy ok no
notice of them and in Milan, where they
had their studios, they consorted exclu
sively with the studio set. They were
quite poo. six or seven years ago, and
worked hard at their painting and model
ing to eke out a scanty living.
Paul, the sculptor, was always consid
ered to be the more talented of the broth
ers. He took a certain pride in being
boorish and capricious in his manners and
was an avowed woman-hater. Peter, the
handsome . painter, whom Amelie Rives
Chanler had captured, aspired to be
something of a dandy, but he had not the
means to live up "to his pretensions.
Among the American students- he was a
good deal laughed at under tho soubri
quet of the Penniless Prince. Since then
his talents have secured him some recogni
tion, but Mrs. Chanler is very much
mistaken if sue imagines that she can ever
shine at the imperial court of Russia as
Princess Troubetskoi â the Russian Trou
betskois do not move in the same set as
their cousins on Lago Maggiore. W&3S&

ARMY AND NAVY NOTES
Additional Contracts for Im
provements at the *
Presidio.
THE BICYCLE PPIVILEGES.
Powder Tests With a 12-inch Rifle.
v Progress of Work on the
[ Oregon.
â â -â¢; Powder testa with the twelve-inch rifle
on the bluffs above Fort Point were made
last Wednesday.- The explosion, shook
houses in the Western Addition and caused
the people dwelling therein to inquire as
to the cause of the disturbance. The regu
lations permit the use of army cannon for
powder tests. These experiments with
high-grade powder manufactured at Santa
Cruz' are made under the supervision of
Colonel Babbitt of the Ordnance Depart
ment. The twelve-inch breech -loading
ride carries a projectile weighing 1000
pounds, and the charge of powder must
give to the projectile a muzzle velocity of
2100 feet per second. Two upright wire
screens are placed in the line of lire a suffi
cient distance from the gun to withstand
the force of the explosive blast. As the
projectile passes through the wire of each
screen a chronograph registers to the
smallest fraction of a second the time of
contact. It is possible, therefore, by the
magnet to measure accurately the time
the projectile takes to pass from the first
wire netting to the second.
.To conform to the requirements of the
Government the powder must not only
give the velocity mentioned but must im
part it without imposing a greater pressure
than 37,000 pounds to the square inch of
the bore. A cylinder filled with neutral
oil attached to the gun registers the recoil
force, or the pressure.
Monthly review, inspection and muster
of all the troops in the Department of Cal
ifornia took place last Saturday. There
view and inspection at the Presidio were
thorough. As the three arras of the serv
ice are fully represented thereâ artillery,
infantry and cavalryâ and as the station is
one of the first rank in military circles of
the United States, General Graham, the
post commander, requires that the inspec
tion shall be conducted so as to fully con
form to the letter and spirit of army regu
lations.
Colonel A. S. Kimball, chief quartermas
ter, Department of California, has awarded
additional contracts for Presidio improve
ments. The* bids were opened a few days
ago and the awards made last Saturday.
The improvements are:
1. Laying a new water main and extending
the water pipe of the fire system.
2. Extending the sewer from the new bar
racks.
3. Extending and constructing drains south
of Fort Point road.
4. Constructing a road in front of new bar
racks. I WP | BBES^fIH
, 5. Constructing drains and ditch for protec
tion of stable site.
C. A. Warren was the lowest bidder on
all propositions except No. 1. On the four
the aggregate of Warren's bids is $7740.
William H. iiealey gets No. 1 at $2294.
The allotments" made for quarters and
barracks for the fiscal year ending June
30,1896, has been exhausted.- When the
money appropriated is allotted in Wash
ington an expenditure of 60 per cent is
only authorized, so that 40 per cent may be
reserved for emergency. Out of this re
served 40 per cent General Batchelder, the
chief quartermaster of the army, may
allow from $50,000 to $100,000 for Presidio
improvements during the last , three
months of this fiscal year. Colonel Kim
ball has sent to General Miles and the
chief quartermaster * plans for the new
Presidio. A map illustrating the changes
recommended was published in The Call
three months ago, at the time the report
was forwarded to Washington. .
: General Batchelder served many years
in this department and is familiar "with
the importance of the Presidio as a mili
tary reservation. He will not retire until
July 27 next, so, therefore, he will be in
office to pass upon the disbursement of the
reserved 40 per cent of this fiscal year's
appropriation for quarters and barracks,
and also on the allotment of 60 per cent of
the allowance for the next fiscal year.
Unless there is an extraordinary de
parture from established military rights
General Batchelder, upon his retirement,
will he succeeded by Brevet Brigadier-
General Charles G. Sawtelle*, the officer
next in rank in Washington. General
Sawtelle has an unblemished and brilliant
record of more than a third of a century,
covering the periods of the Rebellion and
several Indian wars. He graduated at
West Point in 1854, being a classmate of
General O. 0. Howard. He was promoted
Brevet Brigadier-General of the United
States army on the recommendation of
General Sheridan, approved by General
Grant. At Chancellorsville he was pro
moted for meritorious' conduct. ". *
Tne case of Lieutenant R. McA. Scho
field, son of General Schofield (retired),
has been referred back to the Examining
Board at the Presidio. This action, taken
by Secretary Lamont, is due to the discov
ery of new evidence. A few weeks ago the
board, of which Colonel S. B. M. Young is
president, examined Lieutenant Schofield
for promotion, and the examination dis
closed the fact officially that the appli
cant's hearing was defective. The ques
tion now comes up whether this disability
was incurred in the service or whether he
was slightly deaf when the Board of Army
Surgeons passed him. . ;
In the light of an occurrence at the Pre
sidio last Saturday, the post commander
may be con strained to abridge : somewhat
the privileges formerly extended to bicy
cle riders.. According to the report made
by the surgeon at the Presidio Hospital to
.General Graham, this is what took place
Saturday morning on the grade of the
hospital road:
Mr. Hamilton of Oakland, mounted on
a bicycle and going down the road, at
tained greater speed than, he desired. In
an effort to slow down he lost the pedals
and the speed increased. Seeing two
soldiers in the road, he swerved to
one side to, avoid a collision. At the
same instant Lyon, one of the soldiers,
swerved in the "same direction to escape
the. wheel. Collision ensued and Lyon
was knocked down. He was scratched
and bruised, but not disabled. Re
covering his balance, but not his temper,
he started in hot pursuit of the Oakland
wheelman. The latter seeing : the .indig
nant, pursuer fled, and to accelerate his
flight abandoned his wheel. The = soldier
overhauled the Oakland â  sprinter. No
blows were exchanged at the meeting, but
high : language '.. was used.' The doctor in
officially reporting the matter 'to- General
Graham could not say that ' the ' soldier
used f profane language, but he was ' sure
that'; the : talk was loud. / Moreover the
soldier in his wrath seized the wheel, and
with terrific force hurled it down an em
bankment. , ; . . ;. 'â ^&EBs^^&&Â£m?Â§
ii; About this time the surgeon intervened
and began pouring: oil to r allay the fric
tion." Hearing both sides of the i contro
versy and deeming each participant blame
worthy in some degree, he finally decided
that the soldier should apologize J for the
high language and stand, the trifling cost
of mending: the bicycle. Lyon refused to '
accept the terms prescribed â¢/ and s was I ac
cordingly j arrested. The â¢ summary court
this morning will hear his : case. ;i Hamil
ton, the Oakland wheelman, whose record
as ; a ' sprinter - has been Â» established, has
been notified to attend ,, the trial. The
affair â  will f- be adjusted -no I doubt \to the
satisfaction of all concerned, without con
vening a board of -officers at the Presidio
to ascertain the damage to the wheel.
â -'â â  â ' Society ; on :. the â¢ Sound, especially \ the
belles V- of : Seattle fl and 'â â  Tacoma, will be
pleased to hear that Mr. Herbert, the kind
hearted Secretary of the Navy, has re
mitted the unexpired portion of the sen
tence of the : court-martial in - the â  case of
Lieutenant Werlich of the ; Philadelphia.
The lieutenant, serving under -Admiral
Beardslee on the flagship, endeavored to
respond to all the requirements of hospi
tality on the Sound, but 'his capacity to
dine, digest and drink was not -equal to
the occasion.' So one morning as he stepped
aboard the cruiser after a night ashore he
wobbled. : The wobble was officially no-'
ticed and he was arrested.; The trial took
place in the harbor of San Francisco; and
the lieutenant, pleading ; guilty, got the
light : sentence of six months' suspension.
He had served two months and lost four
numbers in the order of future promotion
when the Secretary of the Navy mercifully
came to his rescue.
The Union Iron Works will make special
effort to finish the battle-ship Oregon before
March 31. ;; The chance of getting another
big ship to build would be increased if toe
Oregon should achieve an exceptionally
good record in tha Santa Barbara chan
nel.
Next Saturday one of the big 13-inch
rifles for the after turret of the Oregon will
be placed in position.
The Union Iron Works last "Wednesday
received the first shipment of material for
tne new gunboats.
HIBERNIANS ATTEND MASS
They Turn Out in a Body and
March to St. Mary's
Cathedral.
An Address by Archbishop Riordan
in Which He Highly Com
mends the Order.
The spectacle of a large body of Hiberni
ans, in full regalia, marching on Market
street at an early hour yesterday morning
was interesting. They marched in fours
and were en route to St. Mary's Cathedral,
where they approached the Blessed Sacra
ment in a body. Captain Maber was in
command of the column, and Captain
Jerome Deasy, Captain Sheehan, Lieuten
ant Reilly and John Kenny acted as aids.
The column was formed in front of the
Hibernia Hall, at 120 Ninth street, and
marched directly to the Cathedral on Van
Ness avenue. It was estimated that nearly
one thousand stalwart men weie in line.
His Grace, the Archbishop, officiated at
the mass and administered the com
munion, and was assisted by Rev. Fathers
Crowley and Mulligan. Following the
services the Archbishop delivered an ' ad
dress in which he said he was glad to see
so many men present. It was cheering to
see so many approach the altar, especially
in an age of indifference and infidelity. He
said that they belonged to a race that had
suffered ; more" for faith and nationality,
than any other people in the world. He
urged them to retain and cherish the best
and noblest traditions of their race in this
favored land which is their home and the
inheritance of their children.
While upholding the institutions of
their country and loyal to its laws it would
be well, said the Archbishop, for them not
to forget the virtues of their race as put
into - practice in ages of oppression and
persecution.
The Archbishop extolled his hearers to
live up to the principles of the society
which are essentially beneficial and benev
olent. ; He praised the good work of the
order and said he was glad to know of its
splendid prosperity and advancement. -.;
Great benefits, he felt, could be derived
from their reading-room, and he com
mended the work of providing a place of
recreation and amusement where the mem
bers could spend their evenings pleasantly
and profitably instead of going to saloons
and other resorts. > ;
The Archbishop closed his address by
urging the members of the order to perse
vere in their noble purposes, and wished
them every blessing.
The- A. O. H. of America can boast of
two of tha handsomest lodgerooms in the
City. They are the Washington and the
Sheridan halls at 120 Ninth street. These
halls are occupied every night in the year,
as not only thirteen divisions of the A. 0. .
H. meet there, but they are also occupied by
many courts of the Foresters. The new
headquarters have a well-equipped library,
a large reading-room, smoking and card
rooms and all the accommodations neces
sary for a large and growing organization
of this kind. ~
Among those who are very active in
promoting the welfare of the society may
be mentioned M. J. Manning, Peter J.
McCormick, P. J. Sullivan, Thomas R.
Bannerman, E. I. Sheehan, Captain
Maher, Captain Jerome Deasy, J. J. Mo
ran, Robert O'Reilly, John Kenny, Mr.
O'Connell of No. 10, McConville of No. 14,
P. J. Dolan, J. F. Renault, J. P. Dignan,
Captain Wrin. P. J- Meehan, J. P. Henry,
Eugene McCoy and others. Within the
last year or so the society has made great
progress, and is now probably the largest
Irish-American organization in San Fran
cisco.
FOR POLITICS IN LABOR
Permanent Organization Dis
cussedâLabor Council
Sub-Committee.
Idea of Conducting the Labor Move
ment Along Political Lines
Has Encouragement.
The sub-committee appointed by the
executive committee of the Labor Council
held an informal meeting yesterday morn
ing for the purpose of discussing plans for
a permanent organization' and to further
the' possibility of putting into effect the
desires expressed by the last convention of
February 14. Owing -to the fact that sev
eral of the members were absent, it was
finally decided by the committee to take
no definite steps, but to meet again .on
March 15, the day of the next convention,
an hour and a half previous 'to the open
ing of the larger meeting.
In the meanwhile each member will im
mediately prepare something on the plan
of a permanent organization and submit
it at the meeting, the ultimate result to
crystallize into a set of resolutions which
will in turn be submitted to â¢-. the conven
tion. â¢': . ''- : .â %â 'â '.

AN OSTRICH HUNTER'S TALE
Relative to Africans as Athletes and ,
Heir Use of the Nut That Im-
parts Strength and Vitality.
AN ARMY SURGEON'S EXPERIENCE.
Yale Athletes Continue to Win r and UsÂ©
Kolafraâ Cyclists Test Vino-Kola-
fra in a 600 Mile Spin.
The most interesting reminiscences of Afri-
can travelers, tourists and explorers relative
to the habits, character and peculiarities of the
natives of Africa are those which describe the
African as an athlete. All agree as to his
wonderful physical development.
Sailors and soldiers, ostrich and ivory hunt-
erg who are familiar with the coast and in-
terior of the country, its people and their cus-
toms, ascribe the African's magnificent phy-
sique to the pinkish-colored sterculia nut, prep- .
arations of which are now creating such a
furor in the civilized world, which the natives
chew constantly, and which is said by them to
be a gift from heaven. To it, they claim, they
owe their strength, health and power to with-
stand hardships. The nut is native to Africa,
and is cultivated in tne West Indies. It has
been in general use by tho Africans for years.
Its beneficial effects on native Africans have
been described by the most famous. medical
writers and scientists of Germany, France and
England, and by travelers who have visited
Africa. Wonderful virtues are ascribed to it as
a tonic and stimulant. The native African is
the most perfect athlete known. He is a beau-
tiful specimen of physical power, strength and
activity. Mentally he is bright and happy,
possessing a remarkable fund of vitality and
energy.
Repeated efforts have been made to intro-
duce a preparation of this nut which would
represent its qualities as combined in the
fresh, unchanged nut. All efforts la that di-
rection failed, however, until Johnson & John-
son, of No. 92 William street, this city, estab-
lished a laboratory in the. West Indies, where
the nut is gathered fresh and put up in tho
form of Vino-Kolafra, the use of which has of
late become almost universal, it having re-
ceived the united indorsement of the medical
profession. It contains the unchanged princi-
ples of the fresh nut, and is a pronounced suc-
cess in the treatment of diseases in which a
tonic is needed. It prevents fatigue, and
enables one, by its use alone, to undergo great
hardships of continued duration.
In this age of rapid living the human system
demands.something to produce energy, prevent
fatigue, give strength and tone to the system
to a degree proportionate to the manner of life.
No remedy, previous to the introduction of
Vino-Kolafra had been successful in meeting
these requirements. In the treatment of all
nervous diseases, anaemia, general debility,
heart affections, dyspepsia, melancholia, bil-
iousness diarrhoea, incipient phthisis, and all
affections where a powerful tonic and stim-
ulant are necessary Vino-Kolafra has proved
superior to any other remedy.
Pome interesting facts were gathered by the
writer from persons of note in regard to Vino-
Kolafra.
Dr. L. W. Peacock, ex-United States Array
surgeon, corner Erie and Eighth streets, Jersey
City, in relating his personal experience with
Vino-iKolafra, sard: "I am decided in my opin-
ion that Vrfao-Kolafra is the finest tonic ever
known. Some time ago ray carriage became
involved in a smash-up and got decidedly the
worst of a bad bargain. At the repair-shop I
was informed that it would require at least ten
days to reconstruct my vehicle. As my prac-
tice is very large, I was somewhat bothered at
first as to what course to pursue in the treat*
ment of my patients. I finally concluded to
visit my patients on foot and to use Vino-
Kolafra as a stimulant and tonic to prevent
fatigue and give me the strength required to
endure the exercise without exhaustion. I
expected, as usual, to be worn out by evening
of the first day, and was most agreeably sur-
prised when I found myself apparently as fresh
and vigorous as I was previous to starting on
my day's visits. The same thing happened the
second day, and so on every day until my car-
riage was finished. It stimulates the contrac-
tion of muscle cells, which in ordinary labor
become loose and lax from exertion, and by
its tonic effect seems to produce no end of ca-
pacity for labor. I now use and prescribe it to
patients in all cases where a tonic stimulant
and invigorant is indicated. Africans who use
it seem never to grow old, but retain their full
vigor until death. They will work all day and
dance half the night under its effects. I con-
sider it the best tonic known."
Mr. M. McMillan, an electrician, of No. 101
East Ninety-second street, said: "In 1867,
when I was a sailor, we were anchored off Port
Elizabeth, in Algoa Bay, Africa. In the crowd,
besides myself, there were an ostrich hunter
and an elephant hunter. In relating tales
concerning the. Africans and their character-
istics, these hunters dwelt upon the fact of the
incessant use by the natives of a pinkish white
nut which they chewed to give them strength
and prevent disease. When I read the article
on Kolafra is a World of recent issue, I knew
it was the same nut, and immediately pro-
cured some Vino-Kolafra. I had been troubled
with malaria, accompanied by a feeling of
lassitude, dyspepsia and depression, my flesh
bloating at times. In my business Ido a great
deal of walking, which made me so fatigued
that at times I could hardly move. I was also
very susceptible to colds. Since taking Vino-
Kolafra I have experienced no malaria or
lassitude, my appetite and digestion are splen-
did and my flesh is firm. It has completely
overcome that 'tired feeling.' I travel all over
the city, upstairs and down, and always feel
fresh and vigorous. I have not had a cold for'
along time, while continually subject to sud-
den changes of heat and cold/ When I go out
I take a glass iof Vino-Kolafra instead of an -
overcoatâ it does me more good. It is the â¢
b3s t thing for general knockedoutedness that I
ever saw.";
A very unique and novel plan for testing the
merits of this widely heralded tonic and stim-
ulant as a fatigue preventive and food substi-
tute has been proposed and arranged by Mr.
F. A. Neuman, a 1 newspaper man' of this city.
Mr. Neuman is a prominent cyclist, and has
arranged a tour extending over 600 miles to
be made with a wheel. , He will be accompa-
nied by a friend. The two will carry parcels
strapped to the shoulders weighing twenty-one
oounds.. The object of the .trip is to test the
merits of Vino-Kolafra as a strength sustainer
and ,' food remedy. ; No nourishment will be
partaken of during the trip, the sole sustenance
of the wheelmen being Vino-Kalafra.
The outcome of this trial will prove of value
and interest to all bicycle enthusiasts, athletes
and others who are engaged in active exercise
or labor of any sort. The result of the trip
will be reported. ,
Vino-Kolafra, now sold by all druggists, is
proving -an indispensable addition to the list
of medicines. In the treatment of all diseases
accompanied :by tissue waste and loss of en-
ergy, to bridge . over the exhaustion produced
by continued [ suffering and as - a stimulant
and tonic in any case from any cause, it is the
only natural remedy that will generate vital-
ity and force enough 'to recover. It supplies
that something to the human needs which is
always necessary jto complete a perfect exist-
ence. To the laborer it imparts strength and
vigor, lightening ; heavy 'tasks and giving im-
! munity from fatigue.' To the brain-worker it
gives a wideawake mental sensibility, pro-
ducing free and rapid thought. To the busi- -
I ness man/ laden 'with ; : care, worry and depres-
sion, it renders a cheerful 'feeling of -con-
tent ; and well-being. V To the athlete it will
prove a valuable boon in time of hard training
and continued exertion, and in the treatment
of diseases it - supplies a want which, as = Hr.
Smith of : ' Brooklyn . said, ''has long been ex- \
perienced in prescribing for diseases where Sj'- v
good tonic is necessary."â Y. World. .V '

Independent Order of Odd Fellows. |
At a final meeting of the delegates in- j
terested in the furtherance of tne Odd Fel- j
lows' Library, held last Saturday night, the j
board of trustees returned with unanimous ap
proval the plan previously presented a com
mittee of the delegates for the extension of the
usefulness of the library. The plan, which is j
as follows, affords to all who may wish to take
advantage of it an excellent opportunity of
availing themselves of the advantages of this
well-supplied library. . It provides that all sub- J
ordinate lodges be requested to become con
tributing members of the library on payment
of $1 per member per annum; that such fra
ternal and literary organizations of this City
as may be unable by the board of trustees to
participate in the advantages of the library be
permitted to do so on payment of $1 50 per
member, or such members as may wish to join,
per year; that any individual properly recom
mended be permitted to become a member on
the payment of $3 per annum; that Odd Fel
. lows and members of contributing lodges may
become contributing members on payment of
$2 per annum, and that the management, own
ership and control of the library shall remain
in the hands of the I. O. O. F. lodges as con
templated in its foundation and act of incor
poration.
Santa Rosa Lodge celebrated its fortieth
anniversary last Friday in great style. Among
those present were Deputy Grand Master War
boys and C. W. Savage, G.-R. There was a full
representation of the members of the lodge, and
there was a very interesting programme of
exercises.
The anniversary of Golden Rule Lodge of
Oakland was celebrated last Friday in Oakland
with that eclat that has in the past character
ized the annual reunions of this lodge. Unity
Lodge, as it has done tor the past twenty years,
paid Golden Rule a visit, and the visitors were
cordially welcomed and entertained. There
were also present a large number of invited
guests.
The Veteran Odd Fellows have been invited
to. visit a number of the subordinate lodges.
They will call on Fairmount Lodge on Wednes
day the 18th inst., and will call on Porter
Lodge of Oakland some time in April.
Porter Lodge will celebrate it anniversary
with appropriate exercises on the 15th of April.
. . On the 14th of April Unity Lodge will cele
brate its anniversary.
. At the home in Thermallto there is need for
Increased accommodations, and with that pur
pose in view, the upper part of the building
is being fitted up as sleeping rooms.
A number of applications have- been re
ceived for admission to the home, and there is
also a great demand for a home for orphans.
These are subjects that will' be considered at
the next meeting of the trustees. â¢
Grand Master Gosbey will during the current
week make visits as follows: March 3,
San Jose; 4th, Spring Valley Lodge, at Ar
buckle; sth, Grand Island Lodge, at Grimes
Landing; 6th, Central Lodge, at Williams.
Grand Patriarch Reid visited Mistletoe En
campment at Nevada City last Monday. He
was at Camptonville on Tuesday; with Blue
Range Encampment, at Davisville, on Wednes
day; with Union Encampment, at Grass Val
ley, on Saturday. To-night he will visit So
lano Center Encampment, at Suisun.
In accordance with a law adopted at the last
held session of the Grand Lodge of this State
the subordinate lodges will on the last regular
. meeting night this month elect representatives
to the Grand Lodge.
The Rehekah Lodges.
Since the Ist of January Oriental Rebekah Lodge
has initiated nine candidates and at this time has
eight propositions on the table to be acted on in
â  tbe near future.
Elections for representative to the State Assem
bly that is to meet in this City on the second Tues
day in May will be held in each lodge on the last
- regular meeting nigh in this month.
Representatives from each of the Rebekah
lodges of this City will hold a meeting this week
for the purpose of discussing the propriety of es
tablishing a home for orphans of Odd Fellows at
some point either In Alameda County or In Santa
. Clara County. It is the opinion of a number of
those interested in this matter that the establish
ment of a home for orphans In the vicinity of the
- home at Thermallto is not advisable for the reason
that the distance Is too great and the cost of trans
portation too high to permit those who wish to
visit the little ones often to do so. -Another matter
for aiscussion will be a proposition to have the or
phans' home, when such Is established, placed un
der the care of the Rebekahs. This has been done
in Pennsylvania, and most satisfactory results
' have followed. Women are the natural guardians
of children, and it is claimed that they, are the
ones who should have charge of the little orphans.
A point to be raised In favor of locating the pro
posed home within fifty miles of San Francisco is
that more than one-third of the mombership of the
order is located within the counties of san Fran
cisco, Alameda, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Marin.
Contra Costa and adjoining territory. Amity and
Templar lodges each have $300 set aside for the
proposed home, and the members are in favor of
contributing it to a home in any of the counties
named. ',
Fannie Benjamin, the grand president, is still
very busy. She will make visits as follows: March
2 at Tracer, March 3 at Selma, March 5 at Fresno
In the afternoon and in the evening at Reedly.
March 6at Sanger, March 7at Fresno. â¢ -
The entertainment and dance given on Saturday
night by the Bebekahs in Odd Fellows' Hall drew
to the hall an audience that filled every seat on tbe
main floor and in the gallery. It was a pleasant
entertainment given under the supervision of Mrs.
Mollie McColllster, president, and Mrs Antoinette
Shaw, secretary. The programme was made up of
seven numbers. There was an overture by Ben
nett's orchestra, specialties by Miss Alice Keller.
a cornet solo by Miss Jennie Dixon, a vocal trio by
Mrs. W. H. B. Schmied and daughters, a recitation
by Miss Emily Cornelius, a contralto solo by Miss
Xena Roberts and selections by thirty members of
Professor Grater's Mandolin Club. There were
â¢ twenty-rive mandolins and five guitars, and the
thirty young ladies produced most exquisite music
that charmed the audience, with the exception of
two garrulous women, who in the rear seats kept
. np such a loud chatter as to disturb the enjoyment
of those near them. The performers were forced
to give an encore, and they were applauded to the
echo. Dancing followed the entertainment.
The reception by the Rebekah lodges to Grand
Master Gosbey last Tuesday was one â¢of the finest
. affairs ever got up in that section of the, State.
Mrs. Gertrude K. Moreland, P. P., presided, and
there was an immense attendance of the Rebekahs
and of members of subordinate lodges, Grand
.Secretary Shaw. Past Grand President Simpson
and many prominent Odd Fellows were present.
H. V. Morehouse delivered an interesting ad
dress and speeches were made by a number, of
those present. The reception was followed by a
banquet, at which some 300 persons were in'at
tendance.
During March Grand Master Gosbey will visit
Rebekah lodges on the afternoon of the days
named: March 4, Diamond lx>dge atArbnckle;
6th, Pearl Lodge at Williams; 7th. Deborah Lode*
at Colufa; Rei Lodge at Gait; 18th, Elk Grove

Grand Treasurer Booth was present at a meeting
of Golden West Lodge last week. This lodge has

An important decision was recently rendered by
"Ihe Supreme Court of Kansas. A member became
delinquent in a subordinate lodge for the I non-pay
ment of an ' assessment and died three days after-'
ward. The widow of the ; member; brought suit,
claiming that it was the custom to accept the pay
ment of assessments after they were due and to
make no record of suspension, 'The court held In
favor of the order, upholding tbe laws ot the order
regarding suspension and I the decision made that
no subordinate , lodge or officer thereof lias the
right or power, direct! or Indirectly or In any
other way, io dispense with the positive require
ments and regulations of the order.
Valley Lodge No. 30 on Wednesday evening

Arrangements have been effected through the
office of the grand recorder with the railroad com
panies of the Stale whereby representatives at

tives, advising them how to proceed In order to ob
tain the reduced rate.
In a case tried some time ago before Judge
Greene and a jury in the Alameda Superior Court.
a vera let was rendered against the order. A mo
tion for a new trial was made, at which time sev
eral important points were advanced in behalf of
the order, which the Judge sustained in granting
the motion for a new trial, and they were, sub
stantially, that when the order shows the suspen
sion Of a member for failure to pay on or before
the 28th of the month, that the burden of proof is
then cast upon the plaintiff to show that rein
statement has been had.' and a full compliance
with the laws and regulations of the order; that
if a member is expelled under the penal pro
visions, charges having first been preferred, and if
there was any informality in the procedure, or in
justice done, lie must first exhaust his remedyâ
by appeal to the Grand Lodge or the other tri
bunals of the orderâ and must pursue all the rem
! edies provided by the order before lie can invoke
the aid of the courts of the land.' â ;â¢

BUDD ASKED TO
SAVE THE BOYS
Petitioned to ' Keep the Boy
Burglars Out of
Folsom.
THEY MAY GO TO-DAY.
Blind Home Director Hirshberg
Also Writes to the
NffiÃ Governor.
â¢ FAVORS A REFORM SCHOOL.
. .. . <s
If No Clemency Is Shown It Is Feared
â -. Majors' Mother Will Not Long
Survive.
-' . Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
â¢':'.' ' 90S Broadway, March L )
A petition was forwarded to Governor
Budd to-night asking for his immediate
intercession to prevent the boy burglars
from being sent to Folsom.
... The. prisoners will be sent to the peniten
tiary Monday afternoon unless the execu
tive clemency is granted.
: ; The petition is as follows:
"To.His Excellency James H. Bndd, Gover
nor of the State of California: The under
signed would respectfully call your atten
tion to the case of the two minors, Abe
Majors and Bert Wilmore, now under sen
tence to serve ten years in Folsom peni
tentiary. Tne boys are under 17 years of
age, .'.d we feel that when you are fully
acquainted with the facts you will be per
suaded that the case is one that merits
your interference.
"In the case of one of the lads, Abe Ma
jors, a particularly strong case of previous
good character exists, including a good
career in the Young Men's Christian As
sociation and several people who have
employed him.
"At his trial Mr. Haywards of the Rail
road Restaurant testified that he would
employ Majors at once were De at liberty.
He also said that he had frequently in
trusted the boy with several hundreds
each month and had never known him to
. misuse a cent.
"Both lads made a clear confession of all
that they had done and assisted the police
to' find the stolen property. Mrs. Wagner
is completely prostrated, and it i 3 certain
she would not survive the shock many
.months should her boy be sent to Folsom.
.. â  ''if you will order a brief delay in the
taking of the boys to Folsom we will at
once prepare and forward to you a com
plete statement of the case."
Several friends of Mrs. Wagner, the
mother of Abe, signed the petition, and
David S. Hirshberg promised to write to
Governor Budd to-night, advocating the
sending of the lads to a reform school.
D. Hirshberg is the man who was chosen
by the Governor to succeed John P. Irish
as director of the Blind Home. It is
thought that his letter will have much
weight with the Governor.
.'â¢I was a . deputy sheriff at the time
Majors' father aitid," uaid Director Hirsh
berg to-night, "and I have taken an in
terest in the boy for many years, I think
the penitentiary is no place for those lads,
and I believe they should be sent to a re
form school. Desperate as their crimes
werÂ» those boys sre not hardened crim
hidls, and to â '".â ' to Foisoni would
, r;i ; n "ail their future lite."
Ihe Sheriff has orders to take the youth
ful prisoners to Folsom to-morrow after
noon, and unless he receives orders from
the Governor his present "instructions will
l*-* carried out.
That young Majors is not an innocent
stripling, now penitent, was proved by his
utter indifference to the grief and presence
of his broken-hearted mother until such
time as he was convinced that the reverse
would be more advisable. In this be
havior he was seconded by his .elder
brother, Archie, who is nowdoinsr all he
can to help the man who is now in jail for
refusing to support his two little children,
born while, he was the husband of the
Majors' mother. It is to be regretted that
justice is not always meted out with such
indiscriminate zeal from the Alameda
County bench.
As the case against the boys now stands,
the Governor will probably pardon them
as soon as they have showed evidence of a
desire to become useful citizens. Judge
York made this recommendation in bis
order of committal.
ONE MORE DAY OF WORK.
Berkeley Students Will Complete
Their Work on the
. Campus To-Day.
Petition Sent to Governor Bndd by U.
C. Students Asking That Reinstein
Be Appointed for a Long Term.
BERKELEY, Cal., March The stu
dent â ' laborers at Berkeley will have one
more- day in which to . finish the work
they have undertaken on the university
campus. To-morrow has been declared
a holiday by President Kellogg for that
purpose.! The piece of work furthest
from completion is the excavating around
North Hall. 'â  With the exception of put
ting ("own the crushed rock and gravel the
new entrance to the grounds from Center
street is complete. Most of the force of
laborers will therefore be put to work in
the vicinity of North Hall. The news of
another day's vacation was heralded with
delight among most of the college men
because of their desire to put on the finish
ing touches to the excavating and road
luakipK, and also because they might have
another day's rest from study, being a
fact that under ordinary circumstances
they are required to attend college continu
ously for the entire term without a day's
vacation excepting on the National hoii-
â lavs.
The: poetically inclined and the lovers
of symbolic monuments have already
found abundant resource in the "student
labor movement" for tbe; satisfaction of
their esthetic tastes. Roger S. Phelps,' 97,
lias written a poem in honor of the college
"disr'-' who left his books to ply the pick.
Quinah, the Josh artist, has drawn a pic
ture of a typical student laborer at rest
with his shovel, and suggests that a mon
ument of Parian marble .'be- wrought to
resemble the drawing, , and , that it be
placed in a conspicuous part of-, the
campus or in the library, where future
freshmen may gaze upon it at their pleas
ure. President Friend of i the Associated
- Students suggested last night : in s bis ad
- dress that the 29th of February he ' set
aside as the "University of California
â¢student labor day." Though the day can
'be celebrated only in leap years, -he
thought that, so long as tbe celebration
f^si^Sk?3^sS^^fSr^SlS^ssmmJsmÂ»BmsMMVÃmÂ»mmMtÃW^a^ll^^,
last night fell on the 29ih, all other cele-.
brations of the movement should date
from it. , â¢-.-
Following is the poem -which Phelps has
written on the "dig":
The college dig of former days
Was ,i strange, uncanny wight,
His digging Â« as done afar from the sun,
In silence and at night.
But behold the change as years roll on,
The college dig must toil
Where the sun beats hot and the shade is not,
A-turning the mouldy sol.
And tnis is the son* of the college dig,
As the dirt and gravel fly; -.
As the pick-strokes punch' and the shovels crunch,
And thÂ» whwlbanows trundle by:
"Oh, give me a spade of the Iron-gray, .
nd a pick of stoutest steel;
And a barrow good of oaken wood,
With pneumatic-tired wheel!
"For the college dig must dig, must dig,
i hart the classf-s <"*-et to come
Ma; go to worK o'er never a quirk,
And straight retire home.
"And the folk who come in future years
siiall walk the road we Bake,
And In our praise their voices raise
As the crookless way they take.
"Then, brethren, bend ye body down
To delve amid the mould;
Though our hand be worn and our trousers torn,
And our feet be damp and cold.
"But when our noble work is done,
And we toil in the d ri no more.
We may sit us down in our college gown
And dig as we dug of yore.
"So give me a spade of the iron-gray,
And a pick of stoniest steel,
And a barrow good of oaken wood.
With pneumatic-tired wheel." â¢
Glee Club Concert. Â» [
BERKELEY. Cal., March I.â The Uni
versity of California Glee Club will give
their "first local concert of the season to
morrow evening at the Auditorium, San
Francisco. Manager Veeder has been
actively engaged for the past three or four
weeks in arranging the business details of
the concert, and to-day he stated that he
expected it to be the event of the season.
Ever since the beginning of the present
term the club has been practicing almost
daily with y the hope of getting into the
best of form for to-morrow ni'4ht. Several
new features will be introduced, and the
university mandolin club, which was
formed last fall, will make their first pub
lic appearance. This will be the first con
cert which the club has given in San Fran
cisco since the joint entertainment which
they held last fall at the Auditorium in
connection with the Stanford Mandolin
Club.
The entire university is expected to turn
out and make the event in the nature of a
merry climax to the work of the student
laborers on the campus, which will be
completed to-morrow afternoon. The first
and last numbers will bo a combination of
the Mandolin and Glee Club. Mrs. Olive
Reed will sing "Ben Bolt," with humming
accompaniment by the Glee Club. Charles
E. Parcells, the violin soloist, will act as
accompanist in some of the selections.
The programme is to be entirely new, the
club having recently received a large num
ber of the latest songs from the East.
Frank Strinebam, barytone, will sing a
solo in which he will make hits on local
institutions and on Stanford. The "Stan
ford School Scholar" will be one of his
pieces.
Following is the personnel of the club:
First tenors, Morse, Bake well, Elston and
Somers; second tenor?, T. A. Smith. Tay-
T. Smith and Knight; first bass, String
ham, Whipple, Rawlings and Russ; sec
ond bass, Veeder, Parsons, Hutchings and
Wedemeyer.
â¢Justice's Court Attacked.
BERKELEY, Cal., March I.â The le
, gality of Justice James' court has been at
! tacked in the suit of Thomas Gomford
against Christian Melcher for $113 75 bal
ance of an account for rent. The ground
which was taken in the motion to dismiss
the case was the unconstitutionality of the
act establishing the Berkeley Justice's
Court, in that it fixes for Berekeley an ar
bitrary classification unrecognized by the
| Constitution, and in conflict with the gen
' eral Jaws and the Supreme Court decisions.
The question of the constitutionality of ,
the local court of justice"- is raised about j
every so often, and the citizens are becom

IT WAS A COLD DAY.
But Few People at the Park and * Cliff. |
A Balloon Ascension at Haight
Street.
The sharp, cold â¢ atmosphere yesterday
had the effect of keeping people away
from the park and the ocean beach.
Travel to the Cliff House district was by
the Sutro line and the park and ocean
steam line, the cxiff steam line having
shut down by reason of the cave at the
south end of the tunnel near Point Lobos
a few days since. A gang of men have
been at work making repairs, but several
I days will elapse before it will be in opera-
tion again.
In the park driving was light, bicycles
were not numerous and pedestrians were
few. The only noticeable event in the
bicycle line was the turnout of the Impe
rial Club which went over the drives and
to the cliff in a body, making a very fine
appearance. P a SBIBr 9a 9^BR3^BI

and seventy-nine varieties of aboriginal

known as a builder of railroads in Cuba
and Guatemala, was a visitor to the
museum last week and he promised
Curator VVilcomb that he would contrib

tiquities from Central and South America.
All but the lower story frame of the

At the southern end of the court a high
bank is being built up of sand. This will
be sown with grass, and: will serve as a

The Haignt-street grounds had, consid
ering the day, a good attendance. More
than 3000 people passed through the eatcs
up to 5 o'clock. There were nearly , that
number of people .within the enclosure
when Miss Essie Viola made a successful
balloon ascension. She rose about 1500
feet, then cut loose her parachute and
came down on the peak root of a dwelling
on Lyon street, near Oak. Sue was rescued
Irom'her uncomfortable landing place and
taken back to the grounds. It had been
announced that the balloon was to carry
un two parachutes, with Professor Emil
Markeberg clinging to one and Miss Viola
clinging to the one underneath his, but on
account of the high wind: it was deemed
inadvisable to ,4 make â  the double ascent,
and Markeberg withdrew in favor of Miss

THE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 2, 1896.
BEWARE OF TYPEWRITERS
Dr. Harmon's Philosophical State
ments About His
Woes.
DECISION OF JUDGE YORK.
How the Water Companies' Methods
. Have Proved a Detriment
to the City.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 1. : i
Dr. Harmon, late of San Leandro, has
given expression and weight to a phrase
that cannot help but ultimately eclipse the
famous utterance of Sam Weller relating
to widows. Dr. Harmon's philosophical
bon-mot is "Beware of typewriters." This
gentleman's litigation shows how speedily
cases can be attended to in the Alameda
courts when no politics are involved in the
issue and when twenty thousand dollars
in good treasury . notes is one of the ex
hibits in evidence waiting to .be distrib
uted. It did not wait long. The details
of the case hare been told at intervals, but
they can be summed up in very few words.
Dr. Harmon was anxious to avoid paying
alimony, so he turned all available assets
into cash and was arrested while trying to
leave the State. The groundlessness of
the charge is best proved by the fact that
it has been withdrawn in the Police Court.
But it sufficed to hold the doctor till he
could be takenâ with his $20,000, of course
âto the Supreme Court. A request was
made for a receiver for the estate and it
was immediately granted. The receiver
had to get bonds.
Ten minutes later he had them, and a
few minutes later the divorce case was set
for trial a few days nee. At the ap
pointed time the parties and the $20,000
were in court. After a little talk the court
adjourned. Before his marriage with his
typewriter Dr. Harmon was worth about
$60,000, and his typewriter was, according
to the doctor, without a waterproof , roof
over her head. "When the doctor walked
out of court a few days ago he was worth
$8000, his ex-wife had $12,000 in cash, the
San Leandro home beautifully furnished
and two and a half acres of land, the little
boy, an absolute divorce. Her brother also
has a dental education, for which Dr. Har
man says he paid over $3000 and an otlice
furnished worth $500, which the doctor
says he also paid for and for which he has
receipts. When the doctor finished telling
his etory to a reporter be said: "It is the
old philosophy, 4000 years old. Never lay
your wife's family under great obligations
to you, and â beware of typewriters."
Many hard things were said of Judge
York of Los Angeles the day he sent Oak
land's boy burglars to Folsom for ten
years, but now the majority of people
think the sentence was just. It is very
probable that the pressure brought to bear
on the prosecution and the bench to have
the lads sent to a reform school would
have been rewarded had the case been
tried by an Alameda County Judge. Under
the circumstances a home Judge would
undoubtedly have attached as much
weight to the witnesses on the boys' be
half as to their testimony, and indeed no
other course could be expected. Judge
York, who was sitting for Judge Greene
during the- Tatter's illness, knew nothing
of the witnesses and judged the case solely
on the testimony. He saw no mitigating
circumstances, but did see before : .m two ;
lads who confessed that had .they been
molested during any of their raids they
would not have hesitated to use the pistols
with which they liberally armed them
selves. His conclusion that to send such
voting desperadoes to a reform school
would be an encouragment to romantic
youngsters to go and do likewise is gener
ally approved. There are many, how
ever, who would .like to see the lads kept
out of State prison on account of their age
and lack of proper training. *
The Council meeting to-morrow night
will be one of unusual interest to every
property-bolder in this city. The > rates
for the next fiscal year are to be fixed and
the two rival water companies will be on
hand to show why rates should not be
made as high as they want them. The
question of water rate?, and the virulent
war that has been waged between the two
companies for the past year has a feature
that if not yet known to one person in a
thousand. During the past year hundreds
of columns of matter in the local papers
have been devoted to the different water
companies. These statements were in the
form of analyses of the various waters sup
plied from different sources. One com
pany would publish the most damaging
statements regarding the, other company's
water and vice versa. The people of Oak
land â whose health statistics show it to be
almost the healthiest city on the coast
merely laugh and congratulate themselves
that they were reaping the benefit of cut
rates. The following portion of a conver
sation with a real estate dealer of standing,
held recently, puts the water fight in a
new light.
"I was in Los Anaeles recently," said
the realty man, "and I" met a gentleman
who had just invested thousands of dollars
iniCalifornia property. He told, me that
his original intention had been to locate
in Oakland, but that he had read so much
that was detrimental to the water supply
of this city that he had decided to go else
where. I asked him, how his attention
had been called to these reports, and his
reply was somewhat of a surprise. â¢ He
said that the realty men interested in sell
ing property outside of Oakland were re
printing and circulating thousands of
these newspaper reports and suggesting
that Oakland is a good place to pass by.
Not being acquainted with the methods
employed in this City, where one corpora
tion tries to undermine another, they be
lieved what they read, and everybody suf
fers in consequence."
Where so much is involved there is need
for much discretion. : Whether" the two
companies ultimately combine or not will
not affect the -rates. The : real ; values -on
which to ; base estimates are pretty well
known, i but : there -;â  should -be some wav
found to force the competitors to abandon
combative methods of rivalry that are in
jurious to the whole community.

GROWTH OF ALAMEDA
Its Expansion This Year on the
North Instead of the
South Side.
The Growth so Rapid That School-
Room Facilities Likely to Get ,
Short Again.
; ALAMEDA, Cal., March I.â Although
the schoolroom facilities of Alameda were
increased during the year .; 1895 by the
erection of one splendid, ten-room-'school
house and the rebuilding of another to
which four rooms were added there is now
very little leaway. The increase of school ]
children here is not to be figured on the |
same lines as in other cities and towns.
The population is increasing on an aver
age rate of 500 a year I and - an unusual
percentage of the increase is children. The
accession to the population is chiefly
families and generally the cause of it is
the fact that the , conditions - are excellent
for the rearing of children and the oppor
tunities for their education good. If the
growth of the city keeps upâ and it prom
ises to surpass previous yearsâ further ex
pansion in the schoolhouses will be neces
sary in the near future.
. Trend of the Building Movement.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March There were
164 houses erected in Alameda j during the
year 1895 at an outlay in round numbers of
half a million of dollars. This number
promises to be exceeded during the year
1896. One firm began the erection of four
teen houses on Friday last. The movement
in building which for years has been most
active on the south side now bids fair to be
transferred to the north side. The south
side having > been the favored section so
long has been well improved, and lots are
held at a high figure, v ith not a great
many left. On the north side there ; are
some large tracts as yet but partly im
proved, and they are not held at such pro
hibitive figures. The improvement of Oak
land Harbor and the digging of the tidal
canal have given a fine water front to tnis
section of the city, and the view of Oak
land and the Contra Costa hills is inspiring.
It is seemingly but just discovered that
this part of town is very desirable for resi
dence, and that is where the bulk of the
building improvements is likely to be for
the year 1896.
The Run of Flounders. .
ALAMEDA, Cal., March I.â This is the
time of the year when flounders run, and
big strings of them are taken in waters
adjacent to Alameda. The quiet waters of
the tidal canal seem to attract them, and
they come up on the tide and settle down
on. the muddy bottom in such numbers
that they are ready prey for the angler.
Dr. Riehl caught as many as he could
comfortably carry in two hours on Satur
day, and in proof of the readiness of â  the
fish to bite relates that one of his catch
swallowed all three of the books on his
line.
A Claim -Questioned.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March I.â C. F. Carl
son has filed a formal protest against the
payment by the City Treasurer of any
money to Lmil Kirchhoff on a claim pre
sented by him as wages for superintend
ing the work of laying the artificial stone
walks about the grounds of the new City
Hall. Kirchhoff was appointed by the
Municipal Board to that position. City
Treasurer Wheeler has referred the claim
to the City Attorney to pass upon lis
legality. "'
BLAME IT ALL ON JAMES
Said to Have Prejudiced the
Governor Against John P.
Irish.
He Does Not Know Whether He
Will Resign or Hold
i On.
Oakland Office San Francisco* Call,[
908 Broadway, March 1. )
Director Leach of the Blind. Home, the
only member of the board who was not
appointed by Governor Budd. does not
know whether he will resign or not, and
will not say whether or not .he expects to
be dismissed like his colleague on the
board, Colonel Irish. _ â â¢ _','Â«
The particular circumstances that led to
the appointment of Daniel- S. Hirsbberg
in the place of John P. Irish were made
known to-day. ...-â 
At the first meeting of the board after
the new appointees took office there was
an evident disposition to convince Direc- j
tors Irish and Leach that , their methods
were generally distasteful, and that if
they kept quiet and did not make them
selves objectionable to the majority
they might be permitted to retain their'
seats. This spirit was particularly mani
fested by Colonel James, even to details.
He made it so apparent that be had nc use
for any precedent that the two directors
who had been on the board since the home
was inaugurated resented the suggestions
of their incapacity. Particularly obnox

forcibly, and at the last meeting he was no
less independent. â /.
When ; the board last met. there was a
new bone of contention â¢ between the two
factions. A bill was presented for the
payment of a month's salary ;to a "fore-.

Hays was appointed and Irish stated that
had Hays known what his blind predeces

bill, but "it went through. Then ; another
matter came up. The old superintendent
used to dine with the inmates. :â¢ Since Mr.

a separate table for himself. This neces

again stood out against the new method. _.

BISHOP GOODSELL OFFICIATES.
The First Church of Its. Kind Ever
Built in San Francisco Many
People Present.
Bishop Goodsell in â¢ the presence of a
large audience, and with ceremony fitting
the cause and occasion, dedicated the new
Norwegian -Danish Methodist Episcopal
church to the cause of Christ yesterday.
This new house of worship is located on
Tenth.street, between Howard and Fol
som, and as it was the first Norwegian-
Danish church built in San Francisco un
der Methodist auspices the occasion was
not considered an ordinary one. The ex
ercises proper were of an extremely sim
ple nature, but none the less impressive
by reason of this. ' ..'â .:.- ""â /.."
Bishop Goodsell began by reading in a
clear, impressive manner the introductory
dedicatory service as laid down in Metho
distjules. Then came a Norwegian hymn,.
Dr. K. H. Bentley of Berkeley following in
a short prayer.
: Bishop Goodsell then read the one hun
dred and twenty-second psalm, selecting
that part which says: "I was glad when
they ..aid unto me, let us go into the house
of the Lord." In the course of his remarks
he said: â¢

sion-inspired these wordsâ whether it was
some feast or dedicatory service or some
other equally important exercise. But I
do know that it is fitting .'. in God's

in his name. If the heart be once with
God the whole earth is his temple. The
only one who finds true ecstasy and joy in
living is he whose life is dedicated to God.;
Such a man, and such a man only, is en
titled to live."
The reverend gentleman then said that
the natural state of . man was antagonistic
to churches, to religion. He objected to
Sunday services, or in fact, anything that
in any way curtailed his social privi
leges. Those, however, who understood
the full meaning of that invitation, "I was
clad when they said unto me, let us go
into the bouse of the ; Lord," knew what
the house of God meant.
At the conclusion of this brief talk Rev.
C. J. Larsen, the organizer and pastor of
the new church, and who it may be stated
at this time is also presiding elder of the
California district iof Norwegian-Danish
mission work, announced that the organi;
zation started out $900 in ; debt and he
would like to decrease this as much as
possible... Something over $350 was raised.
Bishop Goodsell -then resumed the dedi
catory exercises, at the conclusion of
wuich the congregation wus formally dis
missed.
: Rev. C. J. Larsen, pastor of the Tenth
street Norwegian M. E. Church, first came

TO THE PUBLIC.
A Guarantee From the Columbia
Theater.
As the general public is perhaps not
familiar with the excellency of the enter
tainment to be given by Freeman's Fun
makers at the Columbia-Theatre to-night,
the undersigned beg to stare that their
; presentation of "A Railroad Ticket,"
which is recognized as one of the very
funniest farce-comedies ever written, will
more than delight the theater-goers. The
company includes Mr. Eugene Canfield,
Miss Beatrice Norman, Mr. Charlts E.
Grapewin and other well-known comedians
and specialty artists. The fun is furious
from first to last and many original novel
ties are introduced. Popular prices will
prevail. Respectfully,
Friedlakder, Gottlob & Co.
A DESPERATE ROBBER.
Knocks a Chinese Down on the Street
and Struggle* Desperately With
,thÂ« Police.
â¢Jo Anthony, a young hoodlum, yester
day perpetrated one of the boldest outrages
Chinatown has known for some time.' He
met Ah Chong, a Chinese who had a very
rich gold bracelet on his arm, at the corner
of Clay street and Benbam place, and
demanded his money. The Chinaman
started ,to run away, . when Anthony
knocked him down. Putting his foot on
the neck of the prostrate . Ah Chong,
Anthony tried to pull the bracelet off the
Chinaman's arm by main force.
Ah Chong screamed with pain. This
attracted a crowd who piped a shrill ac
companiment with police whistles. Officer
Barry, who was two blocks away, started
for the row and chased the would-be robber
to the corner of Clay and Kearny streets,
where he caught Anthony and knocked
him down. *
Anthony was up at once and threw him
self on Barry. A desperate struggle ensued
which resulted in the policeman's dragging
his opponent to the California-street sta
tion. There another scrimmage ensued;
the prisoner and the police were mixed in
discriminately for a while, and it was some
time before they could be separated.
Anthony was then put in the dark cell.
Ah Chang's arm was dislocated by
Anthony. It was fixed up by the nearest
doctor. A charge of attempt at robbery
was placed against Anthony. V-'A
MILLIONS ARE INVOLVED
A Case Which May Cloud the
Title to Much Sacramento
Property.
The Supreme Court to Decide Whether
Estates Have Been legally
Settled Up.
A case which will involve the interests
of many San Franciscans and which may
plunge 791 estates, valued at over $2,091,
--482, into utmost confusion is to come up
before the Supreme Court to-day. It is a
petition of Mary A. Hensley for a per
emptory writ of mandate to compel Supe
rior Judge Matt V. Johnson of Sacramento
to issue a decree that due publication of
notice to creditors was made in the settle
ment of the estate of Calvin P. Hens ley,
Hensley died July 26, 1889, leaving an
estate worth $25,000. . The Probate Court
of Sacramento made the following order
on September 13, 1889:
In the matter of the estate of Calvin P. Hens
ley, deceased: - It is ordered that C. C. Perkins,
G. Knott and John Miller be appointed ap
praisers of said estate, and that notice to the
creditors be given in the : Daily Record-Union.
â -.-. The publication was duly made for four
weeks in accordance with the ; statute?,,
which provide that unless otherwise speci
fied ' the publication ' should be for ; that
length of time. The work of settling the
estate was almost completed, the time in
which claims against it might be presented'
had long expir d, when* a mortgage for
$12,000 was brought forward by a" tardy
creditor. ;; , V
This creditor claimed that since the
court had not specified any '-' particular
period during which "- the publication of
notice to creditors was to be printed,
the order was .not according to the stat
utes : and â¢ was of no force, and ere fore
their claim was not barred.' Mrs. Hensley,
through her attorneys, Steams and Elliot,
argued that . the statutes did . not >. require â 
any particular period: to, be named since
they ; said publication ; must ;be : made for
four weeks unless otherwise ordered. 'The
publication had been made for lour weeks,
and she asked Judge Matt F. Johnson to
issue a decree that proper publication had
been made. â  - -
â¢ He refused, and the estate was put in the
same condition â as when the probate pro
ceedings were : first" begun seven years
before. The case before the Supreme Court
to-day is to decide the force of Judge John
sons opinion. As â¢ the same â  method of
ordering the publication of notice to cred
itors was in vogue from 1860 till 1890 every
estat? probated in that time will be affected
by Judge 'Johnson's; decision if the Su
preme Court upholds it.
A search of the records shows that no
period of time was specified in the order
for making the publication of notice to
creditors in 791 cases. The estates foot un â 
over $2,091,482. . *

Quarters Occupied by the

Memorial Project.
A dreamy, quiet man in his easy chair
before the fireplace in a dim, old room.
That is not what a Call artist saw yes
The Chair and Fireplace in the Room That Robert Louis Stevenson Occupied at 7 Montgomery Avenue.
. [From a sketch by a "Call"' staff artist.]
â¢-..terday afternoon at Robert Louis Steven
...*. son's long-ago quarters in Washington
.-â /. block, No.' 7 Montgomery avenue. *
â '.".'.; The chair and the fireplace were there,
but the chair was vacant, and all that
could suggest Stevenson to a visitor of the
present time was the book on a table close
. by, or the familiar photograph on the wall
at the farther end of the room.
"It' was at the Washington block that
â  Mrs. Osborne resided before her marriage
to the novelist, and when Stevenson
crossed the ocean to meet his bride he
'.; .-. took up his residence at the same place.
From this building Mr. Stevenson and
, .-'; Mrs. Osborne went to be married, and later
7 .* they returned and made their home there
"â  .until the time for departure to the South
â¢" -Seas.
.'. The room that the Stevensons occupied
is room G, on the third floor of the build
_" . ing, and it is still known as the Stevenson
room, and all that remains there of his
torical interest is carefully preserved. A
lady is the present occupant.
'â ;. Washington block is one of the best
remembered rooming houses of the por
'â¢, tion of the City that was fashionable and
of the first business importance many
years ago. San Francisco's society long
: ago fled from the region, followed by the
â  more aspiring business houses, and only
Bohemianism remained. . The change was
in progress at the ; time of Stevenson's
sojourn there, and in the new-comers of a
* less aristocratic type the author found
some of his literary characters.
(.;. The house is of the architectural style
that is common in that locality. The in
terior is well kept up, and there is a gen
eral air of comfort and respectability that
would not oe found in all the down-town
lodging-houses. A broad, sweeping stair
case leads to the office on the second floor,
and there the visitor is confronted by two
noticeable signs.
One is a large placard announcing the
particular room in which a certain clergy

ABSOLUTELY PURE
man resides, and the other is the familiar
painted appeal:
â¢ Please King the Bell. J
A Call artist complied with the latter
request and Mrs. A. Kites, the landlady,
responded to the summons.
Mrs. Niles is a pleasant, benevolent
looking woman, and she is so great an ad
mirer of Stevenson and so proud that the
author once lived there that she probably
would not exchange the house for any
other in the City. She occupied a room
in the building at the time of the Steven
son marriage and has acquired control of
the premises since that time.
When Mrs. Stevenson came from Samoa
last year she stayed in that building,
which had been her home at the time of
her wedding. Her son-in-law, Joseph
Strong, the artist, has a permanent resi
dence there.
The room that Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson
occupied is a lame, commodious one, look
ing out upon Montgomery avenue at the
Montgomery-street junction. It is com
fortably furnished, much as it was at the
time of the distinguished occupants.
There is a fireplace at one end of the
room, and before it stands a large, uphol
stered and inviting-looking rocking-chair,
which the great writer is supposed to have
occupied.
Mrs. Kites remembers Stevenson well,
and she speaks of him as the quiet
modest-mannered man that the world has
known him to be. She has great regard
for Mrs. Stevenson, who remained there
five months last year.
It is on account of the residence of Ste
venson at this place that Portsmouth
square, near by, has been chosen as a site â 
for the proposed Stevenson fountain. '
. Bruce Porter, the originator of the me
morial project, is confident that the Su
pervisors will permit the fountain to be
located there. He says that if one design
is not accepted others will be offered, and
it is the desire only to erect a fountain or
a monument that will be regarded as a
genuine art work and of which the City
may be proud.
"This will be the only city in the United
i States to have a Stevenson monument,"
: said Mr. Porter. "It is the only American
city that has any claim to a portion of the
! celebrated author's life. ' The people in
the East concede that point, and, with
: characteristic, unselfish action in the in
terest of art and literature, they even con
i tribute their money to aid in the erection
i of a memorial to be located in the City of
i San Francisco.
"Would it not he preposterous for this
City to reject a statue under all these cir
cumstances, with Henry Irving, George
Cable Andrew Lang, John Muir, Bliss
Carmen, Louise Chandler Moulton and
others of that rank among the subscribers
who offer the monument to San Francisco ?
Is it not time that the literary and art
loving people of San Francisco take an in
terest in this matter and insist that the
monument be accorded a : place in the
plaza, nearest to Stevenson's old haunts?
"But I do not think that the Supervisors
will offer any objections when the designs
are properly presented to them, and I do
not think that anybody will be permitted
to ridicule away an undertaking as serious
and well-intended as this one, which has
aroused enthusiasm even; as far away as
London." . . : -Ai?i^
Artists say that the : proposed fountain
would be ;an ornament to Portsmouth
Square, and others declare that water
would not be at all out of place there.
The wettest place. in America is Neah
Bay ' in Washington. Over. 123 inches of
rain fall there every year.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 2, 1896.
BANK FORGERS
ARE CAUGHT.
A. H. Dean and His Ac
complice Arrested in
Minnesota.
WILL BE BROUGHT HERE
Clever and Effective Work of
Captain Lees and the
Pinkertons.
THE THIRD MAN ESCAPES.
Dean and His Pals Were Adopting the
Same Method as With the Nevada
Bank When Stopped.
Two of the men whoso cleverly swindled
the Nevada Bank on December 18 out of
$20,000 by means of a forged draft are be-
â¢lieved to be under arrest, one in St. Paul,
Minn., and the other in Minneapolis,
Minn. â¢
It will .be remembered that a man giv
ing his name as A. H. Dean rented an
office in the Chronicle building on De
cember 2, and two days later opened an
account with the Nevada Bank by deposit
ing $2500 in currency. He afterward [â  de
posited $795 on December 13 and a draft
for $22,000 on December 17. He had with
drawn on December 7 $400, December 12
$700, December 17 $2200 and December 18
$20,000, all by checks payable to "self or
order." Â»
On January 4, sixteen days after Dean
had withdrawn the $20,000, Captain Lees
was notified that the draft for $22,000 de
posited to his credit on December 17 was a
forgery, it had been sent to the clearing
house by the Nevada Bank on December
18, paid by the Crocker-Wool worth Bank,
and sent to the Bank of Woodland, where
it was pronounced a forgery. The draft
had been obtained from the , Bank of
Woodland on December 9 by Dean in the
name of A. J. Scott and was drawn on the
Crocker-Woolworth Bank. It was origin
ally for $12, and the $12 had been raised
'to $22,000, the date changed from Decem
ber 9 to 13 and the. name from A. J. Scott
to A. H. Dean, all in a very skillful and
ingenious manner. '. *
Captain Lees at once made an investiga
tion and he obtained valuable information
from Walter G. Lytle, an office-boy en
gaged by Dean on the morning of Decem
ber 18, and who was with him in a buggy
when he drew the $20,000 from the Nevada
Bank. The captain got a description of
Dean from the boy," and 'â  also a description
of a man who called at the office to see
Dean before they went to the bank. He
also cot descriptions '. of Dean iÂ«. from the.
cashier and paying teller in the Nevada
Bank and others. He made a composite
description and forwarded lit â¢, with other
data to W. A. Pinkerton. Chicago, and
Robert A. Pinkerton, New York, the Pink
ertons having been : over a year ago" ap
pointed as the police representatives of the
Protective Branch of the Bankers' Asso
ciation. 'â¢ . ; "V"* "â '.'.â  ;":.:,'f ; ;'v : .:Â»;v
Since then "the captain and the Pinker
tons have been in * constant : communica
tion, with the object of tracing the forgers;
and that end has -been attained. W. A.
Pinkerton, who is at present in this City,
received a cipher dispatch from his brother
Robert in '. New; York, to be : given to Cap
tain Lees, advising him to be prepared to
hear of the arrest of the bank forgers; and
have \ tho necessary extradition I papers lin
readiness for the Governor of Minnesota.
â¢ On Saturday a dispatch I was received
that they had arrested in St. Paul a man
using the name of G. W. Woods, whose
right name was probably Frank L. Seaver,
and had directed the arrest of â : a man in
Minneapolis using the name of J. M. Shaw,
who/proved to be Joe McCluskey, alias
"Little Joe," a notorious bank sneak thief,
and they were satisfied that both were con
nected, with a scheme to defraud the banks
there by forgeries similar to the one 1 in
this City. The dispatch also stated that
from the description of Dean and sample
of his handwriting forwarded by Captain
Lees they were satisfied that Seaver was
Dean, and the captain was asked to send
an official description to Chief of Police
Clark of St. Paul, so as to hold Dean pend
ing the arrival of the extradition : : papers,
which was done. A dispatch was also re
ceived from Chief of Detectives O'Connor
of St. Paul that he had no doubt about
Seaver being Dean, and Mr. Pinkerton re
ceived a similar dispatch from Chief of
Police Clark. ' - '. '
â¢'. On Saturday night W.H. Crocker of the
Crocker-Woolworth Bank swore to a com
plaint for the arrest of Dean and McClus
key on the charge of forgery and the nec
essary extradition papers were prepared.
Yesterday Chief Smith of Minneapolis
wired for a description of McCluskey. His
picture is in the bankers' album of crooks,
of which - Captain Lees has a copy, and
yesterday; it was shown to the office boy
Lytle, who recognized it as that of the
maji who called at Dean's office on Decem
ber 18. The description and this identifica
tion were forwarded to Chief Smith, so as
to hold him pending the arrival of the
papers.
Speaking of the - arrests Mr. Pinkerton
said yesterday: "We issue to every mem- â 
ber of the Bankers' Association general in
formation which contains a thorough de
scription of any new fraud, a fac-simile '\ of
the handwriting, a description of, the men
and every little detail we can think of and
requesting them to be on the, lookout for
an attempted repetition of the fraud," and
in case any stranger opened an account
with them to communicate with our near
est office. io.77:}'
"Our theory is that these men had gone
to St. Paul and Minneapolis to open an ac-
count, and as soon as they did so the
banks communicated with C.M.Weber,
our superintendent at St. Paul, who took
charge of the case under the direction of
my brother Robert, in New York, and he
being fully provided with Captain Lees'
descriptions and other data readily arrived
at the conclusion that he was on the trade
of the right man, as we had been able to
sift it down to five or six men.
"So far Ido not know anything about
Dean, but will have his record and picture
in a few days. McCiuskey for the past
twenty-five years has been noted as one of
the cleverest bank sneaks in the United
States, in fact, he is the most noted bank
sneak and international thief alive.
"Let me say that the descriptions and
other data prepared by Captain Lees have
been the means of leading to the arrest of
these forgers, and I have never yet seen
anything so minute and so accurate in
every detail. It was one of the best pieces
of work of the Kind that I have ever seen
or heard of."
There is a third party who is wanted
badly in connection with the forgery, and
that is the penman. He is always difficult
to get at, as he is careful never to be seen
in the transaction. Both Mr. Pinkerton
and Captain Lees are morally convinced as
to his identity, but lie has fled since the
arrest of Dean and McCiuskey.
HOW THEY WERE CAUGHT.
The Cashier of the Minneapolis
Bank Mistrusted Depositor
McCiuskey;
ST. PAUL, Minn., March I.â Joe Mc-
Ciuskey and John T. Seaver, the men who
swindled the Nevada National Bank' of
San Francisco out of $20,000 last Decem
ber, have been arrested in the Twin Cities.
Their identification as A. H. Holmes and
A. H. Dean is complete. Dean or Seaver
has practically admitted that it was he
who laid down the raised paper at the
Nevada Bank. There is no question that
McCiuskey was his partner. The men ar
rived here about February 19.. Seaver
went under the name of D. W. Woods and
opened an account at the St. Paul National
Bank. McCiuskey presented himself at
the Union National Bank of Minneapolis
and made a deposit of $3300 in the name of
' Joe McCluskey, one of the Nevada Bank swindlers, who has been arrested at
St. Paul, and will ;hi brought back with his pal, A. H. Holmes, to be tried for
raising a check from $12 to $22,000. ; ' ;

MRS. TUNNELL'S STORY
Miss Overman Vainly Tries to
Weaken Its Crushing
Force.
LOCATING AN INTERVIEW.
Dr. C. 0. Brown Prostrated After the
Strain of the Past Weekâ The
Council To-Morrow.
Mrs. Tunnell is one of the most im
portant persons in .many respects now
figurine in the Brown case.
Mrs. Davidson, the alleged blackmailer
of Key. Dr. C. 0. Brown, has affirmed with
much emphasis that Mrs. Tunnell is the
one person in all the world outside of the
accused pastor and his alleged partner in
crime. Miss Overman, who can give the
inside facts of the interesting case. This
statement is born out by Mrs. Thurston of
Oakland, Mrs. Barton of this City and in
cidentally the Overraan-Tunnell letters.
At this stage of the case it may be inter
esting to reproduce in part at least an in
terview had with Mrs. Tunnell by a Call
reporter while that lady was at the home
of Mrs. Hayes -in Visalia. In some few
important details the statement made by
Mrs. Tunnell at that time differs material
ly from the story told by Miss Overman on
the witness-stand. This is particularly
true â¢as concerns the mode of exit on the
night of her hasty flight from: the Brown
house. The Call of January 10 contained
the following: )-^ t 7'7.7^-^f'-y7 r '-^\::t^
VISALIA, Cal., Jan. 9.â Under the glare
Mrs. Tunnell, i/he Witness the : Council
Would Like to Hear.
an electric light on one of the side streets of
Visalia is the home of a good Christian woman,
and in her safe keeping is Mrs. Tunnell. :
The Call representative has had a tiresome
siege of it in following up the trail of the miss
ing witness. Shortly after 9 o'clock this even
ing word was received that Mrs. Tunnell would
see The Call reporter. After entering the
house she did not delay, but came in with out
stretched hands and remarked: - , â  â -. *
"I hope that all my friends will know, to
morrow that I am in the best of health and in
safe hands." . ' .v
"Why did you run away?" was asked. â¢
"From* the reporters, and also dread of a
subpena. 1 I don't crave notoriety. " I am not
afraid to tell what I know, and if I could be
secured from that I would cheerfully testify.
1 was getting tired of it ail and so made up my
mind to escape." . * "
. "How did you carry out your intentions?"
' "Well, first I went to Dr. Brown's house, but
the reporters were thick and persistent; they
just bung around * trie ; house . till midnight.
'hen I left by the rear entrance and went to
my friend, Mrs. Eaton, in Oakland. They soon
located me there and It was just as bad as at
Dr. Brown's." I left there, in the evening and
went to Mrs. Hayes at Grangeville. Was there
a week and was feeling safe. '.*â¢'-**;* â¢ ?-::"'â *'
"During the Midwinter Fair time I attended
Dr. Brown's church and introduced myself to
him, and asked him if he lately had heard
from Miss Overman. *To my surprise he an
swered : . , â .-.':-.-â 'â 
" 'Yes, she is here in San Francisco and visits
our home every few days.'
"She called on me at. my request and lived
with me for several months. She then went to
Dr. Brown's.
"Yes, Miss Overman greatly admired Dr.
Brown, and told 'me ; about the intellectual
feasts they . held every evening. She was

I read it. : If you remember, Mrs. Tunnel 1 sent
for her clothes by a gentleman friend. I had
"never met him before, but knew that he could
be trusted, because Mrs. Tunnell had sent him.
This gentleman told me he was present at

was present throughout the interview and can
prove what I say, though Ido not now know
where he is.
Saturday night the following dispatch
was sent to the gentleman who secured
the Interview:
Mr. J. P. Carroll: Where did interview with
Mrs. Tunnell take place? Mattie Overman says
it occurred in the woods.
The reply to this message was received
yesterday and reads:
VISALIA, Cat,., March I.â interview with
Mrs. Tunnell was in a two-story brick building
surrounded by fruit trees. Not in the woods.
**â ?â .-/?â¢â  .. Carroll.
Miss Overman, when asked last night if
she had anything further to say about the
matter, replied that she had not. The
young lady could give no reason why
these letters, which she claims to have
forged at the instigation of Mrs. Davidson,
were not demanded of Mrs. Tunnell before
that lady took herself to the wilds of
Lower California.
There were the usual services at the
First Congregational Church yesterday,
Professor Lloyd occupying the pulpit at
both morning and evening services. Dr.
Brown was quite prostrated yesterday
when he learned of the death of Deacon
Eaton. He retired early last night, and a
telephone message at a late hour reported
the reverend gentleman resting quietly.
The council will reconvene to-morrow.

Boynton Before the Y. M. C. A.
/r The Rev. M. P. Boynton, pastor of the First
Baptist Church, Eddy street, spoke yesterday
afternoon in the Y. M. C. A. hall upon the mar
vels of nature and life that are all about us
and yet in most cases are passed over in a mat
ter-of-fact way and unnoticed. He said that
greater than all the other wonderful and cu
rious works of God is man, complicated and
marvelous in the minute: physical details of
his organism, hut withal not perfect.' Jesus
Christ, he declared, was the ideally perfect
man â  whom everybody would concede to be so.
Some chemists affirm that the ideal ink
consists â : almost exclusively rof * gallate Jof
iron, and that j the nearer* the' liquid ap
proaches this substance the more perfect
