CRIPPLE CREEK
LIES IN ASHES
Completely Destroyed by a
Second Incendiary Con
flagration.
MANY LIVES ARE LOST.
Tremendous Explosions Scatter
Death While the Flames
Are Raging.
THIEVES SHOT WITHOUT MEECY
Their Bodies Left in the Burning
Buildingsâ A Thousand People
Homeless.
CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., April 29.â A1l
of the business district of Cripple Creek
spared by the fire of last week was burned
to-day. At least a dozen lives were lost
and as many more persons badly injured.
There is nothing left in Cripple Creek but
the houses on the hill. The town is prac
tically wiped out. -The people are almost
in despair. Mayor Steele has invited as
sistance from neighboring lowns in the
way of tents for the homeless, but the
police department feels able to cope with
the situation.
Allthatis left of the camp is "Old Town"
over to the east, Capitol Hili, the residence
section northward, and scattering places
about the Florence and Cripple Creek
yards. West Cripple Creek, across the
Freeman placer, was also spared. The loss
cannot fall short of $2,000,000.
All the substantial business houses of
both brick and wood, the leading hotels,
oflice buildings and better class of retail
shops went up in smoke or lay in chaos as
the result of the use of dynamite exploded
tv stay the names. The conflagration
ended only when the residence portion
was reached and open spaces occurred
across which the flames could not reach.
Added to the horror of the day was the
shooting of many thieves caught looting
the coins. Five were shot in town to-night
and two in .Poverty Gulch. Twenty-five
firemen were injured during the day. The
ruins are still blazing fiercely. People
have sought .refuge in boxcars, sampling
works and shafthouses. Two trainloads
have gone to Victor and one to GiiJette.
\\ ord I.as been received of the starting of
relief trains with bedding, provisions and
clothing from Denver and Colorado
Springs.
Fire has broken out in West Cripple
Creek to-nisiht, but, this section being
Jargely of scattered cabins and cottages,
it will not be very serious.
To-day's fire, which was of undoubted
incendiary origin, started in the Portland
Hotel on Second street shortly after noon.
A brisk breeze from the south was blow
ing at the time, and the fire rapidly gained
such headway that even with a good
water pressure the Fire Department was
unable to check the progress of the in
creasing flames. The Portland was a
great rattle-trap, and offered the best of
kindling for the beginning of a conflagra
tion.
The entire population was quickly set
into a panic by this fire, fcthe people had
not recovered from their terrible experi
ence of last Saturday. Without delay
everybody began to prepare to pack up
and get away, but so rapid was the prog
ress of the flames that the people soon be
came panic-stricken and chaos ensued.
It is absolutely impossible to portray in
words the scenes which followed until the
flames had spent their power.
Teams were lashed up and down the
streets by excited men ; people with bun
dles and papers were rushing pell mell
to the northward; shouts, the booming of
the flames, the crashing of fallen timbers
following the explosions of dynamite, all
made one ominous, unintelligible roar.
From the heights of Cold Hill the scene
must have been an impressive one, but
few stopped to witness the sight. Every
body on the hills hastened to lend their
assistance by carrying away valuables,
much of which will hereafter remain un
identified.
At the first hint of looting property the
police, aided by the citizens, gave prompt
notice tbat death would be the fate of all
thieves, but this did not deter the law
breakers. Several are believed to have
been shot and their bodies left to be cre
mated in the conflagration. Rumors of
many lives lost added to the general con-
Bternation, and when the boilers of the
Palace Hotel exploded, killing and injur
ing several people, the panic-stricken,
crazed and excited citizens rushed about
without apparent purpose or object.
The fire originated in the kitchen of the
Portland Hotel, which stood on Second
street, between Warren and Myers ave
nues. Back of it was a lumber yard and
several small buildings. In an hour's time
the roof of the hotel had fallen in and the
flames were leaping across to the adjoin
ing blocks. Booth's furniture-store was
blown up by dynamite in an effort to
check the fire, but in vain. The Maloney
building was next wrecked, with its lawyer
â¢nd real estate offices; the Fair, a restau

rant, and then the Palace drugstore, op
posite the Palace Hotel, on the second
corner, above the Portland. Across Sec
ond street, the Masonic Temple, a two
story brick, stayed the progress eastward
and heroic efforts were made to prevent its
burning.
By this time everybody on Myers and
Bennett avenues and on six adjacent
blocks began to move out. East of Third
street embers falling ignited the tempor
ary building hastily set up on the first
burned district. By 4 o'clock the whole
town was ablaze, and up above Carr ave
nue people were moving out their most
valuable household goods.
On the corner of Second and Bennett
stood the Bimetallic National Bank, and
next to it, in the Cripple Creek Mining
Exchange, was the temporary home of the
First National Bank. All the money was
locked up in the vaults and the place aban
doned when the names crowded the clerks
out. North of the banks were the tele
graph and telephone offices, which had to
be abandoned.
Late in the afternoon the wind veered
around to the east, driving the course of
the conflagration to the more sparsely
built-up residence district, and the fire
died out, leaving the High School building
the only one of any size remaining in the
camp.
The list of business houses destroyed
would include every firm of any size in the
city â banks, hotels, postoffice, dry-eoods,
hardware, clothing, professional offices,
restaurants, rooming-houses, livery barns,
big gambling halls and many residences.
When it was realized that the fire would
now die out the people who had raced to
tne hill began a wild scramble to find
quarters for the night. Special trains bore
hundreds qnickly away to Victor and to
Florence and to Colorado Springs by the
Midland Terminal route. Others will go
later to-night.
There are at least two dead and several
injured as a result of the Palace Hotel ex
plosion. An unknown man was shot by a
policeman while looting a burning build
ins. Only one of the dead men has "been
identified. His name is Griffith and he
worked at Gold King.
Among the injured is one of the Rose
brothers, of Rose & Leddy, druggists; E.
H. Smith, G. E. Youngston, John Kreiger,
E. Bradley and Gene Leyden, but these
names cannot be vouched for. It. is im
possible to-night to arrive at definite facts
as to names of injured or a complete list
of firms.
STARTED BY INCENDIARIES.
Little Doubt as to Bow the Conflagration
Originated.
DENVER, COXA., April 29.â That the
second conflagration at CrippJe Creek was
of incendiary oiigiu there is no doÂ» il i<\
| L. J. Moynahan, the owner of the Port
land Hotel, is in the city. He says that
the hotel was set on fire last Saturday by
an incendiary, who covered a pile of sacks
with coal oil and put them under Koch's
Opera-house. On the first appearance of
the blaze it was immediately put out by
j the watchman. On inquiry Moynanan
discovered that Mr. Brewer, the JesÂ«ee,
carried $6000 on one-half of. the furniture,
which he owned, and for which he paid
Mr. Airbeart $800 at the time of purchase.
On finding out these facts Moynahan im
mediately came to Denver and, calling on
tht? State insurance agent at the capitol
building, he notified that official of the
fact that the place had been set on fire,
and also called at the office of the Board
of Underwriters in Denver to find out
which companies carried the insurance.
Brewer's lease expires May 1. or on next
Friday, which Moynahan has refused to
extend. Moynahan thought that immedi
ate action was necessary, as the $6000 in- â 
surance was not canceled on the furni
ture. The hotel building cost Mr. Moyna
han $38,000, outside of the lots. The in
surance is only $2000.
Residents of Cripple Creek are in town
since the first fire and to-day have alike
told of suspicious circumstances attending
the rapid spreading of the first tire. Many
persons in Cripple Creek, havine paid ex
orbitant rentals during the boom last
winter, and finding a heavy stock of goods
on their hands at this time, have been
sorely tempted.
The insurance adjusters are on the
ground, and much light will be thrown
upon this phase of the Cripple Creek fires
after they get together their evidence.
Though the town authorities have been
of late waging warfare on crooks and tin
horn gamblers, maiiy remain who are
practically penniless, and they, too, hnve
doubtless had a hand in assisting the rapid
spread of the flames on both occasions.
President Steelcof the Chamber of Com
merce promptly wired the Mayor of Crip
ple Creek offers of assistance, and then,
without awaiting a reply, proceeded to
arrange for a special train, a chemical en
gine, a squad of police and provisions.
This, however, proved unnecessary, when
the following telegram arrived:
CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., 6t. m.â A thou
sand of our people are homeless to-night. Can
you have tents sent us? We have enough bed
ding. The fire burned itself out. We have no
use for firemen or policemen.
Hugh Steele, Mayor.
Accordingly necessary supplies will be
sent down on the first regular train to
night. The Western Union has shipped
down wire and instruments, but will have
only one wireâ that used by the Flor
ence and Cripple Creek Railroadâ during
the night. The Postal Telegraph will set
up temporary quarters to-night, and the
telephones are working under difficulties.

The Lives of Hammond and
His Companions Are
Spared.
BOERS ARE MERCIFUL.
Many Sign a Petition Asking
That Full Pardon Be
Granted.
PUNISHMENT NOT YET FIXED.
Executive C:emency Asked by the
Judge Who Imposed the Death
Penalty.
PRETORIA, South ApmcA.,April 29.â Dr.
Leyds, Secretary of State of the South Afri
can Republic, informed Sir Jacobus Dewet,
the British Diplomatic Agent, to-day that
the death penalties imposed upon John
Hays Hammond, Colonel Rhodes and
others had been commuted, but that it
had not been decided what form of
punishment should be substituted.
The Executive Council is now in session,
considering all the sentences imposed by
the court yesterday.
In passing judgment upon the prisoners
the Judge said it was his painful duty to
impose extreme sentence, but he hoped
that the executive would authorize the
same degree of clemency toward the pris
oners he had shown at the beginning of
the year.
Monster petitions are being signed here
and in Johannesburg, asking the Presi
dent to fully pardon Hammond and his
associates. The Boer jurors before whom
the condemned would have been tried had
they not pleaded guilty, also signed a
memorial asking executive clemency.
The State Attorney has ofhciaJly denied
the statement that any agreement had
been made in accordance with which
lighter penalties would be imposed upon
the leaders in the reform movement in
consideration of their pleading guilty to
the charges against them.
HAMMOND COLLAPSED.
Overcome When the Sentence of Death
llos I'assrd Upon Him.
LONDON, E>-g., April 29. âThe Colonial
Office has received a dispatch from Pre
toria saying tnat the death sentences im
posed upon the leaders of the Johannes
burg Reform Union yesterday have been
commuted.
The Daily Telegraph to morrow will
publish a dispatch from ' "-- -ia dated
April 28, saying i\\ni .he accused reform
leaders without exception received their
sentences with dignity. John Hays Ham
mond, after being sentenced, collapsed
and was taken immediately to the jail,
where ho was placed under the care of a
doctor and the chief jailer. The bitterest
feeling exists among a majority of the
prisoners, who consider that they were
badly advised in pleading guilty. Fully
forty of the prisoners avow that they could
have proven their innocence, except so far
as joining in the movement at the last
moment constituted guilt.
At the annual meeting of the Primrose
League, held at Covent Garden to-day,
Lord Salisbury said in an address that he
was sure President Kruger would not use
unworthily the power which circumstances
had placed in his hands.
Lord Salisbury referred to the leaders of
the reform movement sruggling for what
they conceived to be their rightful liber
ties in the Transvaal. This assertion was
received with loud cheers. President
Kruger's name was received with hissing
from some parts of the Premier's au
dience. There was a very large gathering
present, but most of those in attendance
were ladies.
BARNATO'S REVENGE.
The Kaffir King Cloting All Hit Mine*
in the Hand.
JOHANNESBURG, Sooth Africa, April
29. â The Diggers' News says: Barney
Barnato, the Kaffir King, is very bitter
concerning the sentences imposed upon
Rhodes, Hammond and others at Pretoria,
and is showing his resentment by closing
ali his mines and selling all his landed
properties in the Rand. The people are
paralyzed at the prospect, as the closing
of the Barnato mines will throw thousands
of men into the already overflowing ranks
of the unemployed.
KRUGER HAS THE PROOF.
Will Make Public Faett Implicating the
South African Company.
PARIS, Feance. April 29.â The Temps
publishes a dispatch from Pretoria saying
that the Government of the Transvaal Re
public intends to publish documents prov
ing that an understanding existed between
the chartered company and the Johannes
burg. Reform Committee fully four days
previous to the time of Dr. Jameson's
starting on his ftiid into the South African
Republic.
Numerous telegrams in cypher and a
code for their translation were found
among Dr. Jameson's personal effects, and
several communications are alleged to
have passed between a prominent London
financier and Lionel Phillips, one of the
leaders of the reform movement, in regard
to the projected revolution. These show

ARMS AND AMMUNITION LOST.

HAVANA, Cuba, April 29.â The Spanish
gunboat Mesagora has captured near
Berra&os, on the northern coast, the Amer
ican schooner Competitor of Key West,
loaded witn arms and ammunition, for
which she was seeking a landing place.
On board of her were Alfredo Laborde, Dr.
Bedia and three newspaper correspond
ents, who are held prisoners. Some of
the filibusters succeeded in jumping over
board and swimming ashore. Others who
jumped into the sea were drowned. The
insurgent General Monson was a member
of the expedition.
The persons who were captured on board
the Competitor, and those who were taken
in the water while attempting to swim
ashore, have been lodged in Morro Castle.
They will be tried by a naval court-martial.
The naval commander is absent in Man
zanillo, and Captain-General Weyler, who
is impatient for the trial of the prisoners,
has requested him to delegate his author
ity to another official, in order that the
proceedings may not be delayed.
Further details of the capture of the
Competitor show that a detachment of
guerrillas captured thirty-two boxes of
ammunition which had already been
landed, and took two prisoners, apparently
Americans. Shortly after discovering the
schooner the gunboat opened fire upon
her, killing three of her company. Many
others of tnose on board sprang into the
water and swam ashore. Among those
who took to the water was the leader,
Laborde, who was captured, however, be
fore he could reach shore.
KEY WEST, Fla., April 29.â The news
of the capture of the schooner Competitor
caused intense excitement in this city.
Many of the young men said to have been
on board the ill-fated schooner have fami
lies in this city.
A passenger on the Mascotte to-day re
ports thdt he sa-v about twenty men, one
woman and a child being landed on the
dock, ail in chains. Among the men he
reports seventeen Americana. According
to an extra published in Havana this
morning there were only four men cap
tared. ( .
TORTURED IN MORRO CASTLE.
Twelve American* Helil Captive in the
Spanish I'riton.
BOSTON, Mass., April 29.â Walter 8.
Whitcomb, the young American planter
whose reported execution by the Spanish
authorities seemed likely to cause inter
national complications, and who subse
qently escaped from Morro Castle at
Havana by means of a rope, returned to
this city to-day and gives some facts
which are far from flattering to the Span
ish cause.
Wnitcomb was captured while on his
plantation, and without trial or being per
mitted to communicate with his Govern
ment he was marched off to Morro Castle
on the trumped-up charge of naving as
sisted the insurgents. On reaching the
prison he was tied hand ana foot with
several Cubans. In the morning an execu
tioner came around and, marching up to
each Cuban, in turn shot him dead.
Whitcomb was allowed to live, but was
thrown into a miserable dungeon. After
a week's stay, and by the persuasive
power of some money which he had man
aged to secret, on his person, he was al
lowed the freedom of the jail yard. This
obtained, he was able to bribe the guard
to get him a piece of rope, with which Jtie
managed to make his escape.
Whitcomb said that he knew of twelve
Americans who were confined in the
pnson at the present time, suffering the
most horrible indignities, merely on
charges raised by the Spanish authorities
that they had assisted the insurgents.
Wnitcomb will start for Washington early
next week to give testimony to the State
Department in regard to the imprison
ment of Americans.

RICHMOND, Va m April 29.â General
Fitzhugh Lee took the oath of office and
executed his bond as Consul-General to
Cuba here to-day. He expects to get his
final instructions from President Cleve
land Friday or Saturday and it is probable
he will go to Havana next week.
PROSPECTIVE DUEL
After a War of Words, Lexington's Mayor
Challenges the Ex-Mayor to Mortal
Combat.
LEXINGTON, Â£y., April 29.â Mayor J.
Hull Davidson last night challenged ex-
Mayor Henry Duncan to a duel. Both
have their respective organs and have at
tacked each other in the papers. David
son appeared at the Phoenix Hotel last
night, waiting for Duncan, but the latter
did not appear. The feud between the
Davidson and Duncan factions is of long
standing. Several years ago Duncan de
feated Davidson for re-election as Mayor.
Duncan employed an expert bookkeeper
and went all over the accounts of David
son's administration, and claimed that the
examination showed Davidson to be in
debted to the city $15,000. Davidson de
nied this, and the fight between the two
men and their friends has been very bitter
since. Trouble is expected.
A PACIFIC GIBRALTAR.
Xhe Esquimau Military and A'aval Sta

HALIFAX, N. S., April 30.â A well
informed British army officer stated to a
United Press ieporter yesterday that the
strengthening and equipment of t the mili
tary and naval station at Esquimalt, B. C,
has been going on very quietly for some
time. This is now one of the most pewer
ful and important naval stations in any
part of the British empire. Vast quanti
ties of ammunition and war material of all
kinds have been accumulated there in
large shipments. The fortifications are
very extensive and as impregnable as
time, patience and science could make
them. The expenditure at this station has
been tremendous, nnd it is evidently the
intention of the War Department and ad
miralty to make this place the stronghold
of the Pacific. The officer said it is not
generally known, but it is true neverthe
less, that there was a very large number of
engineers at Esquimalt, and the conclusion
was arrived at in the same quiet manner
that the place should be armed and forti
fied. The works and fortifications at Es
quimalt would surprise the world when
their extent and importance had become
known.
Jtig Fire at White Sulphur Spring*.
WHITE SPRINGS, Fla., April 29.â
White Springs was nearly destroyed by
fire last night. The fire originated in the
White Sulphur Springs Hotel and spread
to the Harris livery stable in the Paxton
block, then to Dr. L. M. Anderson's office,
stopping at the Postoffice and Knight &
Pritchard's dry-goods store. The loss will
reach many thousands of dollars, with no
insurance except on vie hotel. The guests
lost their baggage.

BUCK McCARTHY WHIPPED
Chicago's Fighting Alderman Is
Badly Mauled by One of
His Constituents.
Battle Royal in the Leland Hotel,
Resulting in a Number of
Battered Heads.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., April 29.âAlder
man "Buck" McCarthy of Chicago, the
famous slugger of the Twenty-ninth
Ward, was badly thrashed this morning
by William Webb, also of the fighting
Twenty-ninth. One eye was nearly
knocked out and he was thrown down,
kicked and beaten.
The row occurred in the headquarters of
the Second Congressional District in the
Leland Hotel.
Buck was in- a bad humor over the dis
tribution of some delegate tickets and
began to threaten. Webb did not wait for
trouble, but began it himself. He let out
with his right and knocked Buck over a
chair; the next blow caught the Alder
man under the chin and the third sent
him to the floor. Webb then varied the
proceedings by kicking his prostrate foe
in the head, and when McCarthy was res
cued he was covered with blood and was
nearly unconscious.
He was taken to bis room, where a phy
sician attended to him, and later in the
day appeared on the floor of the conven
tion with both eyes nearly closeil and the
general appearance of having had an ar
gument with a threshing-machine.
Several other statesmen also became
mixed up in the row, and a number of
them had battered heads when the hostili
ties ended.

Are Ample.
QUEEN LAURA RULES TO-NIGHT

Jesse.
SANTA ROSA, Cat,., April 29.â Every
one longed for a genuine, professional
weather prophet. Even the local weather
wise were respectfully consulted, for a
shower that came in the forenoon alarmed
the carnival workers. People hastily took
shelter in the stores and houses and dis
cussed the prospect for sunshine, while
the general opinion was expressed that it
would clear up. As soon as the streets
had been nicely sprinkled the sun shone
forth again and for the rest of the day he
did nothing but glow brightly upon the
preparations for the carnival; and now
the local weather prophets are in high
feather, for they prophesied truly and
there is every prospect that the weather
will continue to be warm and brilliant.
The town is all alive to-night. Visitors
have poured in by all the trains and peo
ple from the surrounding country have
arrived in carriages, in carts and on horse
back. Such ample accommodations have
been provided that, in spite of the large
crowd of visitors, every one has had a good
dinner and can look forward tranquilly to
the prospect of sleeping on a comfortable
bed.
Most of the visitors are in the streets,
watching the preparations and admiring
the many decorations which have already
gone up. The marshals, on prancing
steeds, are dashing about, rehearsing for
the procession, and the whole city is one
scene of life, motion and color. Red, yel
low and green flash out from the fronts of
the stores along the line of march mapped
out for the procession.
TLe colors are to be seen in bunting,
cheese cloth and all sorts of gauzy fabrics.
Red, yellow and grean streamers flutter
languidly in the air, for there is little
wind, and nearly every man, woman and
child on the bustling streets wears the
same colors, in the form of bows and
rosettes. Arches, covered with boughs of
redwood and pine, are rapidly being con
structed along the main streets. To-mor
row they will blossom with masses of
fragrant roses, but the flowers are not to
be put into position until the eleventh,
hour, in order that they may preberve
their freshness.
Carloads of roses have been brought
into the city, and cartloads more will be
gathered as soon as dawn comes. The
Athenaeum is being handsomely decorated
for the coronation of the Queen, which
occurs to-morrow evening. Her Majesty
will stand on a raised dais, draped in crim
son or orange, and the carnival colors will
bo displayed conspicuously in the trap
pings of the theater. Behind the throne
is a huge butterfly, banked by masses of
roses. The boxes reserved for the Queen
and her attendants are draped with white
satin and white streamers, and the plat
form is a wilderness of tropical palms and
ferns.
The Queen, Mrs. Laura Matthews Bur
ris, will be gowned in white satin covered
by filmy tulle, and her maid of honor,
Miss Sue Crooks, will wear gold-colored
silk. G. O. Richards, the prime minister,
will have to confine his sartorial ambitions
to a dress suit, but he will add to the pa
geantry by garnishing it with a huge car
nival rosette.
The programme for to-morrow includes
held sports in the morning and bicycle
races in the afternoon, but the chief event
of the day will be the coronation, which
is to take place at 8 p. m. in the Athen
seum.
The Queen and her maids of honor will
ride in barouches, decorated in white,
from the Burris mansion to the Athe
naeum, escorted by Roncovieri's band of
sixty pieces. President J. C. Sims will
deliver an opening address, and Major
J. W. Jesse will give an address of welcome
and present the Queen with the keys of
the city.
A large influx of people is expected to
morrow, but although all the hotels are
already full, such good arrangements have
been made that the committee on accom
modations still has a number of rooms at
its riisDosal.
The carnival committee held a session
to-night and completed all its arrange
ments. It has been decided that prize,
winners shall all be given small silk flags,
red for first prize, yellow for second and
green for the third.
No vehicles will be allowed on the line of
march of Friday's procession and all car
riages wishing to lake part in the
parade must report at the starting point
before 11 a. m. to be assigned places by the
grand marshal. Seats commanding a tine
view of the parade have been reserved for
strangers, so that people coming over on
Friday will be able to secure places as
easily as those who have been here from
the opening of the carnival.
At the coronation the boxes at the west
side of the theater will be reserved for the
San Francisco press.
An interesting feature of the procession
on Friday will be General Vallejo's old
carriage, which was brought out from
Spain in 1834. It is expected that the
general's descendants, to the third and
fourth generation, will appear in the car
riage. The vehicle will be drawn by four
black horses, and will be decorated by
Granville Harris and William Thomas.
Governor Budd and his staff will arrive
in time to paiticipato in Friday's proce*
eion.2

REPUBLICANS.
Nip and Tuck Between Op

Convention.
CULLOM OR M'KINLEY?
Rumored Combinations That
Will Make the Senator
a Winner.
A DAY OF DIN AND CONFUSION.
Captain John R. Tanner Nominated for
Governor and W. A. Northcctt for
Lieutenant-Governor.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., April 29.â 1t will
be nip and tuck in the Republican State
Convention between the supporters and
opponents of the McKinley instructions,
with tbe chances, unless there is another
change in tbe situation before morning,
in favor of the opposition.
There was a time on the floor of the con
vention this afternoon when the machine
was inclined to admit its defeat. This was
before the second ballot for Lieutenant-
Governor had been ordered. The closeness
of the contest for this nomination, how
ever, enabled the anti-McKinleyites and
Cullomites to make a number of deals
â¢ with instructed delegates to some of those
whose conventions had simply indorsed
instead of instructed for the Ohio candi
date, and to-night they are pursuing the
same tactics with the supporters and can
didates for other offices yet to be chosen.
They are strengthened in their position,
moreover, by the development that the
committee on delegates to the National
Convention, the members of which were
selected at the meetings of the various
Congressional district delegations, turned
out to be overwhelmingly anti-McKinley,
the ticket selected by votes ranging from 18
to 5 and 19 to 3. being composed of ex-Gov
ernor Fifer oi Bioomington, William Perm
Nixon and W. R. Pattison of Chicago
and David Littler of Springfield. Mayor
Swift of Chicago received but five votes,
General McNulta, the Chicago McKinley
leader, but three, while ex-Governor
Oelesby was shelved by unanimous con
sent on the ground of his advanced age
nn<l physical infirmities.
The friends of ex-Governor McKinley
insist, however, that the make-up of this
body has no bearing on the ultimate re
sult, inasmuch as the members of this and
other committees were parceled out with
the view of giving each county a fair show
ing on all committees rather than with
reference to an expression of opinion of
Presidential preferences, and they point to
the fact that the committee on resolu
tions, selected in the same way and at the
same district meetings, contains xwo
friends of McKinley to every opponent.
At the same time they are compelled to
admit that under the influence of Senator
Cullom's arguments and pleadings some
of the instructed delegations are getting
restive and inclined to break away. This
was clearly evidenced to-day in the case of
the delegation from Sangamon County,
Senator Cullom's home. It bad been
given ironclad McKinley instructions, but
nevertheless by a vote of 32 to 26 it sent a
Culloni delegate to the committee on Na
tional delegates.
The McKinley men protested and on a
partial verification of the vote reduced the
majority to two, but David Littler, one of
the Senator's closest friends, was in the
chair ana adjourned the meeting before
the verification could be completed and
the remainder of the business finished.
Much of the same methods marked the
close of the first day's session of the State
Convention.
The nomination of Captain J. R. Tanner
of Clay County for Governor on the
first ballot and William Northcott
of Greenville for Lieutenant-Gover-
nor on the second ballot Mas the
sum total of the. work accomplished
by the convention in a session of nearly
six hours. This showing was due in part
to the dilatory methods of the machine
managers, who were anxious to secure
whatever advantage could be gained by
another night of missionary effort, and la
part to the atrocious acoustics of the bi^
globe-ljke structure, which renders it
necessary for announcements from the
chair, motions and roll-calls to be vocifer
ated in turn, parrot-like, by strong-lunged
attaches stationed in the center and oppo
site ends of the hall.
The introductory and nominating
speeches, made for the most part by
chosen representatives of the opposition,
were long drawn out Captain Tanner,
upon being presented after his nomina
tion, spoke for thirty minutes, although
not more than a hundred people in his im
mediate vicinity heard a word he said, and
the bulk of the delegates and spectators
kept up a tempest of ironical cheering.
Their methods, however, had the intended
effect, and when dusk came the vast audi-
ence was tired out. Nevertheless it over
whelmingly voted down a resolution to
adjourn until to-morrow.
When nominations for Secretary of State
were declared in order there was a threat
ened upsetting of the plans of the opposi
tion.
There was a hurried conference with the
chair, another resolution to adjourn was
put in the din and declared carried, and
the chair was vacated before a tenth of the
delegates were aware of the situation.
Ex-Senator Calhoun, the McKinley leader,
mounted a bench to protest, but there was
no chairman to recognize him and the
throng melted away.
With a solitary exception one and all
the speakers to-day avoided mention of
the names of the various Republican can
didates for the Presidency. Congressman
Hopkins made a eulogistic reference to
McKinley in speaking of his defeat for
Governor, but few heard what he said and
no great amount of enthusiasm was mani
fested. The action of the Vermont con
vention, as announced in the disDatches
of the United Press, was circulated over
the floor and employed as an argument by
the McKinleyites with the uninstructed
delegates.
The committee on resolutions, with ex-
Sheriff James H. Gilbert of Chicago as
chairman, was in session nearly five
hours. Much of this period was occupied
in discussion of the money plank, a few of
the members with free s.lver proclivities
favoring a less emphatic declaration than
that presented by Chairman Gilbert.
This, however, was finally adopted by a
nearly unanimous vote.
Congressman Woodman's resolution on
Cuba was also debated at length before
adjournment.
The platform will be presented to the
convention to-morrow morning. Its
financial plank is as follows:
Resolved, That we, the Republicans of Illi
nois, are unyielding und emphatic in our de
mands for honest money. We are opposed, as
we ever have been, to any and every scheme
that will give to this country a currency in
any way depreciated or debased, or in any re
spect inferior to ihe money of the most ad
vanced and intelligent nations of the earth.
We favor the use of silver as currency, but to
the extent only and under such restrictions
that parity with gold can be maintained.
When at 12:20 State Chairman Jamie
son called the assemblage to order, a sea of
10,000 faces looked up or aown to the plat
form. Without any waste of words, he in
troduced as temporary chairman Alder
man M. D. Madden of Chicago, who made
a short speech eulogistic of the Republican
party.
Without effecting a permanent organiza
tion the convention at 10:50 took a recess
until 2 p.m. As the crowd was filing out
s delegate in the body of the hall mounted
a chair and read a dispatch announcing
that the Republicans of Vermont had in
structed for McKinley. This was greeted
with loud cheers, and a blue silk banner
with a picture of the Ohio statesman
which had been smuggled into the hail a
few moments before was waved aloft.
When the delegates reassembled at 2:15
the report of the committee on permanent
organization named Senator D. S. Berry
of Carrol for Chairman and he was
escorted to the platform.
Senator Berry spoke at length upon the
questions of protection and reciprocity.
Upon the financial issue he said, amid re
peated applause:
"The financial issue is an issue that we
must and will meet. The Republican
party believes in bimetallism: they be
lieve in the use of both gold and silver
money; they believe in using them as
money side by side, and that every dollar,
whether gold, silver or paper, shall be as
good as every other dollar; they believe in
the same dollar for the laboring man as
they do for the bondholder; they beiieve
in an honest dollar and in the right and
opportunity of every man to earn one."
When Chairman Berry concluded the
committee on credentials reported that
there were no contests and that each Con
gressional district was fully represented.
Nominations for Governor were in order
at 3 o'clock and the name of Captain John
R. Tanner of Clay County was submitted
by ex-Senator H. T. Hagle of Tanner's
home and seconded by M. f. Madden of
Chijcago.
Congressman Albert J. Hopkins was
nominated by S. C. Hanchett of Aurora.
Dr. Joseph Robbins of Quincy was also
named and a ballot was taken. The first
ballot gave Tanner 1106, Hopkins 160 and
Robbins 69. The selection was made unani
mous, and Captain Tanner was escorted
to the platform and made a graceful 3peech
of acceptance.
For Lieutenant-Governor W. A. North
cutt of Greenville, Theodore S. Chapman
of Jersey and David Ross of La Salle were
named witnout speeches. Northcutt had
a walkaway and the convention adjourned
until to-morrow.
NEBRASKA DEMOCRATS.
The Anii- Silver Faction Has an Inning
and Affirm* and Jtetolces.
LINCOLN, Nebe., April 29.â Nebraska
Democrats of the "sound money school
held their State convention to-day, pri
marily to elect four delegates-at-large to
the Chicago National Convention, and in
cidentally, a* the party leaders announced,
"to 'declare to the Democracy of the Na
tion that Nebraska is not wholly silver
mad."
There was a very full representation of
delegates and an absence of bitter strife in
the deliberations. There was no launch
ing of Presidential booms, the only fa
vored son mentioned being Secretary J.
Sterling Morton, who in advance had" in
dicated his desire that nothing be said in
that connection so far as he was con
cerned.
The committee on platform reported in
substance as follows:
The Democrats of Nebraska, in
assembled, pledge anew our fealty to the prin
ciples of the Democracy. We repel alike the
impudent assumptions of Republican pluto
cratic paternalism and the vagaries of Populist
and socialistic paternalism. We denounce as
dishonest the claims of the Republican party
to be returned to power on account of financial
disturbance produced by Republican legisla
tion, and as equally dangerous the clamor of
Populists and their allies for a more extensive
application for the same pernicious legislation.
We adhere to the time-honored principles of
the party as enunciated by Jefferson and ex
pounded by Jackson, Tilden and Cleveland.
We believe, with Thomas Jefferson, that the
maricet value of bullion regulates the value of
the coin, and not its coin value. We accept the
teachings of economic science that under free
coinage the cheaper money will always drive
out better money, leaving nothing but the
poorer in circulation, nnd that under that
unvarying law the adoption of free coinage of
silver at 10 to 1 would expel from circulation
all tne gold and paper money redeemable in
gold, and leave the country on a silver basis,
with a paper currency and much less of it.
We believe that common honesty and a just
regard for the rights of our creditors, as well
as tne rights of the wage-earner, require us
to use all honorable means to prevent the in
sertion qf a free-coinage plank in the National
platform. We adhere to our previous declara
tions on this subject and declare ourselves un
equivocally and unreservedly for the metallic
money as the standard unit, the bullion and
mint value of which are approximately the
same, and the purchasing power of which, re
gardless of Government mintage, is the least
fluctuating in all the markets of the world.
We insist upon this policy as especially neces
sary for the protection of the farmers, laborers
and property-owning debtorsâ^he most de
fenseless victims of unstable and fluctuating
currency.
We deny the right of Congress to levy taxes
for any other purpose than the maintenance of
the Government and demand a fair trial for
the Wilson tariff law, under which business
and industry have been recovering from the
paraly tlcstroke of AlcKinleyism.
The platform commemis Cleveland's for
eign policy, denounces the action of the
so-called free-silver Democrats, classes the
initiative and referendum as socialistic ex
periments and deplores the efforts of cer
tain politicians to make religious belief a
test for offioeholdir.g.
Just before adjournment the following
telegram was ordered sent to the Michigan
Democratic Convention:
Alfred J. Murphy, chairman Democratic
State Convention, Detroit : -Democratic State
Convention of Nebraska sends greetings. Ne
braska Democracy stands for honest money
end repudiates the doctrines of the Populists.
W. D. McHcgh, Chairman.
MISSISSIPPI DEMOCRATS.
Claim First Place in the Column of Sil
ver State*.
JACKSON, Miss., April 29.â The Demo
cratic State Convention was called to order
at 11:15 a. m. by C. M. Williamson, chair
man of the State Executive Committee, and
with a few brief remarks he announced
ex-Congressman Muldrow of Oktibbaha
County as the temporary chairman. Hav
ing selected L. P. Smith desk and H.
Doxey assistant clerk, the tempDrary or
ganization was made permanent.

said that Mississippi was entitled to first
place in the column of silver States, that
she was a leader and should put none but
true and tried friends of the white racial
in the delegation at Chicago.
He declared it to be his conviction that
free silver would dominate the National
Convention, and suggested that Missis
sippi demand that a free coinage of silver
and a tariff for revenue only shall be the
â¢slogan of the National campaign.
An hour's time was devoted to a discus
sion as to whether a new executive com
mittee should be selected, and it was
finally decided in the affirmative. Each
Congressional district then retired to name
two delegates to the National Convention,
and the convention adjourned until 3
o'clock.
Tbe resolutions prepared by Senator
elect Money favor the free and unlimited
coinage of silver and gold at the ratio of
16 to 1, and instruct the delegates to the
National Democratic Convention, to be
held in Chicago in July next, to vote for a
platform embodying these principles, and
further instruct said delegates to vote for
no man for President or Vice-President
who is not fully and unequivocally in favor
of these principles.
A resolution was adopted declaring it
was the sense of the convention that Miss
issippi should be represented by Con
gressmen and Senators who are in ac
cord with the platform adopted to-day.
Mr. Cle? eiana's foreign policy was con
demned by referring a resolution indors
ing the same to the next State Convention.
A resolution instructing the delegates to
Chicago to present and urge Senator E. C.
Walthall for second place on the Presi
dential ticket was adopted.
SENATOR WOLCOTT'S STAND.
Me Plainly State* the Duty of Colorado
Republicans.
WASHINGTON, D. CL, April 29.âSen
ator Wolcott of Colorado ' has sent the
subjoined letter to the Hon. Irving W.
Howbert, chairman of the Republican
State Committee of Colorado. At this
t time and in view of the recent action in
the Senate of the silver Republicans from
the "West the stand taken by Senator Wol
cott is of widespread interest. The letter
is as follows:
Washington, D. C, April 28, 1890.
My Dear Sir: During the past few weeks I
have received many letters from Colorado
friends on the subject of the coming Republi
can National Convention, many of them ask
ing If I desired to go as a delegate. To avoid
any possible misconception as to my position
I write this letter to you as chairman of the
Republican State Committee. I preler not to
go to St. Louis as a delegate, and have carefully
avoided the slightest indication to anybody of
any sort of wish to be present at the conven
tion in that capacity. I have, however, an
opinion on the subject of our representation at
the convention, which it seems proper that I
should express to you. .',':.
When the Republican State Convention
meets on May 14 it may decline to be repre
sented at St. Louis or it may select delegates.
If the latter the duty of the delegation, in my
opinion, will be to attend the convention, make
the best fight possible for bimetallism in the
committee on resolutions and on the floor of
the convention, if there shall be an opportun
ity for discussion before the whole convention,
and after having insisted by every proper
method upon the duty of the convention to
declare in favor of the restoration of silver as
a measare of value equally with gold, to ac
cept the will of the majority of the convention
and endeavor to secure the nomination of the
candidate most friendly to Western interests.
There is no sacrifice I would not make to se
cure the remonetization of silver, both because
in my opinion prosperity will never return to
us until bimetallism at the former ratio is re
established and because the appreciating value
of gold and the shrinkage of the values which
necessarily follow this appreciation, must bring
only disaster and poverty and suffering to ail
the people of this country who are not lenders
of money. To secure the unlimited coinage of
silver, I would count party ties as nothing. At
this moment, however, the situation which
confronts us is this: Both of the. two great
parties are apparently opposed to free coinage
by the United States. The Populist party favors
free coinage, but only as a means to secure
more currency and as a stepping-stone to un
limited paper money, and it unites with Its
free coinage advocacy, socialistic and pater
nalistic doctrines which are dangerous in ten
aency and which would be, if adopted, de
structive of free institutions.
I know of no fourth party as yet entitled to
our confidence and support, although the wis
dom of leaders whose character and abilities we
trust may find some common ground upon
which bimetallists untainted with Populism
may stand.
Under these circumstances and conditions,
therefore, 1 de?ire to be counted as a Republi
can, proud of the traditions of my party, glory
ing in its achievements and still hopeful that
the great party which has heretofore stood for
the masses against the classes may on this
great economic question yet rank itself on the
sidft of humanity and civilization.
If â¢ either one jof the two great parties shall
declare in favor of unlimited coinage of silver
at our mints, existing political conditions in
Colorado will undergo a sweeping change, and
in this letter I speak only of the situation as it
is to-day. There is, in my opinian, one" event
which might involve our country in worse
disaster than gold monometallism, and only
one, and that would be the triumph of Pop
ulism. Colorado suffered under the degrada
tion and blight of Populist rule for two years.
I believe it is the duty of every good citizen to
stand up and fight in the open against repeti
tion of that ruinous experiment.
One thing further: Our representation is
small at best. To have the slightest weight it
should, if any delegation is selected, be prac
tically unanimous in sentiment and expres
sion. The occasion is not one where personal
ambitions or desire for patronage should in
fluence selection. I have no doubt that the
Republicans of Colorado will select delegates
who are united by a friendly spirit animated
by a common and harmonious purpose, desir
ous of securing the greatest' consideration of
the interests of our commonwealth. This is no
time for differences among our people. I havo
faith and confidence that the way will be mado
clear for good citizens in Colorado to cast their
ballots this fall without sacrificing their honor
or their convictions. ' Yours faithfully, .
Edward O. Wolcott.

VERMONT REPUBLICANS.
A McKinley Resolution Adopted and
Then Tabled.
MONTPELIER, Vt., April 29.-W. A.
Lord of Montpelier presided over the Re
publican State Convention to-day to elect
delegates to the National Convention. A
McKinley resolution offered by Hugh
Henry of Chester was greeted with tre
mendous applause.
The platform declares unvarying de
votion to the Republican doctrines of pro
tection, reciprocity and a consistent and
dignified foreign policy, based upon the
traditional doctrine of non-intervention in
the affairs of the Old World and t lie mainte
nance of the Monroe doctrine; favors a just
but liberal administration of the pension
laws, an adequate system of coast defense
and a reasonable regulation and restric
tion of immigration. The financial plank
is as follows:
The Republicans of Vermont are unalterably
opposed to any scheme to give the country a
depreciated or debased currency. We are
therefore opposed to the free coinage of silver
except by international agreement, and until
re-established we believe the present monetary
standard should be honorably maintained.
The continued agitation of the free coinage of
silver retards the return of our confidence and
prosperity, and stands ia the way of beneficial
legislation, and is in every respect harmful to
the best Interests of the country. The custom
of not restricting delegates to the National
Bonvention by instructions Is adhered to, but
hearty and loyal support is pledged to the
choice of the convention.
The McKinley resolution offered by Mr.
Henry was Jadopted by acclamation, and
later a motion to table it was adopted, the
McKinley men being satisfied with this
expression of the sentiment of the conven
tion.
MICHIGAN DEMOCRATS.
After a Stormy tight They Indorse
Cleveland's Administration.
DETROIT, Mich., April 29.â The Michi
gan State Democratic Convention to-day,
after a stormy fight, indorsed the adminis
tration and financial policy of Grover
Cleveland, chose four gold-standard dele
gates-at-large and sent a delegation of
twenty-four district delegates to the Chi
cago convention, of whom thirteen are
counted gold monometallists and eleven
silver bimetallists.
The convention was the stormiest ever
held by the party in this State.
The free silverites of Michigan, who in
clude the remnants of the old Greenback
party and most of the free-trade advo
cates, had been re-enforced by a consider
able anti-administration force, which has
developed in Michigan during the Presi
dent's present term. The administration
forces wre led by Elliott G. Stevenson,
the law partner of Don M. Dickinson, and
Private Secretary Thurber, while their
opponents were generaled by Thomas E.
Barkworth, administration candidate for
Congress in the Second District two years
ago; Spencer O. Fisher, candidate for Gov
ernor in 1894; Justin R. Whiting, ex-Con
gressman in the Seventh District; Attor
ney-General Ellis and other Democrats of
equal prominence.

vention assembled, indorsed ex-Governor
Pattison as a Presidential candidate, de
clared for "solid money" and nominated
Benjamir C. Potts of Delaware for Con
gressman-at-large by acclamation.
The convention was always under the
control of National Chairman W. F. Har
rity, who iusisted upon a sound gold-basis
platform, upon which ex-Governor Patti
son couid be placed before the country as
Pennsylvania's candidate, representing
the soundest interests of the country, and
the determination of the Democrats of
Pennsylvania to stand for the Wilson tariff
as well.

That She Was Decapitated Dur

CINCINNATI, Ohio, April 29.â When
the trial of Scott Jackson was reopened
this morning Mrs. Sarah Seither, who lives
on the Licking pike, was called to the wit
ness-stand and said she met Jackson and
Walling on her way to Newport and that
they had insulted her. Dr. Edwin Free
man, professor of surgery in the Eclectic
Medical College, was placed on the stand.
Attorney Hayes put the question, at>d
the condition of the body was described.
The doctor answered positively and with
out hesitation that decapitation must have
taken place during life.
"Could the condition of the blood on the
leaves have been produced by moving the
body if the head wa3 severed after death?"
"It could not except by some person
sprinkling blood on the leaves."
At the afternoon session Dr. Freeman

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 29.âSec
retary Olney has been in telegraphic com
munication with the British Foreign Of
fice to-day with regard to securing the
most favorable treatment of Hammond by
the Boer authorities. This line of action
i 3 made necessary by the fact that the

matic office near the South African Re
public, its only representative being a
Consular Agent at Johannesburg and a
Vice-Consul at Cape Town. Vice-consul
Knight wired that he would send further
particulars o* the commutation of the
death sentence, but did not do so for the
reason, undoubtedly, as shown in the
United Press dispatches from London, that
the clemency shown was indefinite and
does not show how far the commutation
went.
WORK OF THE VOLUNTEERS
Commander and Mrs. Ballington
Booth Given a Great
Ovation.
Plenty of Laborers and Money to Be
Enlisted in the New Army's
Cause.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 29. â Com
mander and Mrs. Ballington Booth were
given a great ovation when they stepped
upon the platform of Carnegie Music Hall
last night, where the Volunteers held their
ranks. The house was well filled. The
commander was dressed in a natty suit of
blue. On his left breast was the new sil
ver badge of the Volunteers. On his shoul
ders were fastened the insignia of his office.
As the commander stepped on the stage
the strains of "Hail Columbia" broke
iortb, and the commander offered prayer.
He followed by announcing the hymn,
"I've Washed Myself in Jesus' Blood."
The chorus was taken up by the whole
house and sang with a vim.
"I am very pleased to have this oppor
tunity of standing once more before my
countrymen," began the commander. He
said it was quite titting that the Volunteer
rally should occur on an anniversary of
General Grant's birthday, especially so as
it was in this city that both he and his
wile were received rive years ago.
il I am clad to be here to-night, for after
all Mrs. Booth and I have gone through
and suffered I feel that we owe you an ex
planation of our aims." The commander
said that he felt that this country was
quite large enough for him, for here were
living Englishmen, Irish, Swedes and rep
resentatives of othor nations â all living
happily together.
"I believe in America and ita constitu
tion," said Commander Booth, "'and I be
lieve the country large enough for fifty or
ganizations whose* work should be the
regeneration of the depraved."
The term volunteer belongs essentially
to America, the commander said, and at
the least this organization of which ho
was the leader did not go to England for
its name. As in the days of '76 and again
in '61, the volunteers marched to the front
at the sound of the bugle, so to-day, he
said, a new danger threatened, and he
found ready thousands only too willing to
inarch to the call. Victory, he said, was
emblazoned on the sky.
After a song Mrs! Booth was intro
duced. She was loudly applauded. She
said in part :
"In times of war the general never gives
out in full his plansâ he shows his work in
the results, and," she said, "the Volunteers
were much the same. She felt sure the
V ojunteers would have an army of 10.000
and would have a building of its own.
One friend to-day, Mrs. Booth said is
worth fifty in the days of prosperity. Mrs.
Booth explained that the Volunteers pro
posed to do practically the same work as
t-at done by the Salvation Army. She
made a strong plea for money. She said
that many of the Volunteers were going on
half rations, and it was necessary that
money should be had immediately.
Ushers were sent through the "audience
to take up a collection, and while doing so
Commander Booth read letters of support
from William Eirl Dodee, Rev. Samuel
Viergin, Major and Mrs. Fielding and
several others. As the slips were handed
ud to the platform cheers greeted the an
nouncements. When the meeting ended
there were 210 defenders enlisted and about
13500 had been collected.

PAYMENT OF MESSAGES.
liulinfj Â«s to Telegraph Tolla of Army
Officers Along llond-Aidrd Honda.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 29. -The
Comptroller of the Treasury has rendered
a decision in answer to a request of the
War Department to be informed whether
disbursing officers of the army shall here
after pay telegraph companies for mes
sages which pass over the lines constructed
along the bond-aided Pacific railroad, or
whether the requirements of existing army
regulations that such accounts be sub
mitted to the accounting officers of the
treasury for adjudication and settlement
shall continue to operate.
The substance of this decision is that
wh n the messages are so sent, and ac
counts so kept as to render it impossible
to ascertain the extent to which the rail
road lines are used, the telegraph company
receiving the message without direction as
to their transmission i? entitled to pay
ment on the presumption that only the
lines owned by it were used for the service.
As a result of the decision ihe department
has been obliged to revoke one of the army
regulations.

AT THE MERCY OF A STORM.
They Reach the Coast of Japan
Almost Dead From Starvation
and Thirst.
VANCOUVER, B. C, April 29.â The
Empress of India arrived this morning
from the Orient, bringing the following
Oriental advices: Hans Isaacson, hunter,
Victor Carlsen, boat-steerer, and Frederick
Bartlett, boat-puller, arrived at Yoko
hama alter passing through some perilous
adventures in the North Pacific. Tney
nre members of the crew of the American
Besiiag schooner AJton, Captain George
Wester, tuat left San Francifco in Decem
ber last. After securing a hundred skins
on the American coast the vessel was
brought over to the Japan side of the Pa
cific. On March 30, about 7 o'clock in the
morning, when the schooner was about
fifty miles off the coast, the captain or
dered the boats away to search for s-eals.
The three men got into a twenty-foot
boat and started on their quest. By after
noon they were some miles eastward of
their vessel, when suddenly a fog came
down, completely shutting them in.
They lay to for the rest of the day and
the following night. By morning a half
gale j-et in and a heavy sea sprung up, fill
ing the boat witli water to its gunwales.
A current drifted them further and further
to sea until they must have been fully 150
miles from shore. For two days they were
at the mercy of the storm and with all
their food and drinking water exhausted,
they were in a pitiable plight. When they
left the ship they had but a gallon and a
half of water and provisions for a day on
board.
Gradually the si bated, and on, the
third day they Dei. .. row toward the
west, hoping to see land before long. They
struck a current that greatly assisted them,
and on April 4, tha sixth day after leaving
the shir, they saw the coast of Japan.
They succeeded in attracting the attention
of some fishermen, and with their assist
ance made land.
Their condition was dreadful in the ex
treme, their lips being black from lack of
water and food and the suffering from a
raging and consuming thirst. Their
throats were parched, while their hands !
snd arms were raw irom the effects of the
â alt water. Frederick Bartlett, whose feet
had been frostbitten on a previous occa
sion, was even in a worse state, so swollen
were his nether limbs.
The fishermen gave the starving men j
rice and water ana then sent messengers
inland for a doctor. At the end of a week
they were sufficiently recovered to travel
and left Kisengori, where they had
landed, arriving at Yokohama on the 15th
in st.
A new steamship company is in process
of formation by leading capitalists of
Japan. It will start with capital approxi
mating 3,000.000 yen, with power to in
crease it to 5,000,000 yen if necessary. Ap
plication for a charter was submitted to
the authorities on the 7th inst. The
scheme is to open two routes â one to New
"York and the other to Batoum. The
former will include service to Portland,
Pniladelphia and other points, while the
latter will call at Hamburg, London and
other points commercially connected with
Japan. The object of opening a service to
New York is to facilitate the exporting of
sulpnur, silk goods and other commodi
ties already exported in large quantities to
America from Japan. Eight fcteamers of
5000 tons capacity will be built â four for
each route.
As a direct result of tne Chinese-Jap
anese war the slave trade in Manchuria has
been aggravated. Farmers comprise a
vast majority of the residents of Man
churia and since the war they are suffer
ing from famine. The selling of children
is a'ways more or less prevalent in China,
but the war and consequent famine are
driving many more parents to sell their
children than formerly. Buyers collect
the poor little fellows just as keepers of
registry offices collect cooli9s.
The bean merchant who gives this I
statement to the press saw in Manchuria,
at Yingkow, a woman leading six chila- '
ren, from 5 to 12 years old, barefooted and j
almost naked. The price of a child, if in- |
telligent and attractive, is 2 yenâ sl 06;
the ugly ones bring only a few cents. The â 
slave-broker gives guarantee to the pur- I
chaser that the child's parents will never
again claim or acknowledge the child ',
Bold.
The Japanese press is watching jealously
a tendency of a part of the Koreans to
lean upon America rather Japan for aid in |
reforming the peninsula. It tells the !
Koreans that such an alliance is shallow- i
rooted and doomed to end in bitter disap- '
pointment; that it might serve in time of â 
peace, but in ca^e of war or trouble no i
help could be expected from the proud !
parvenu of nations. Ttie Japanese press j
is full of the term "pro-American" in re- j
gard to Korean affairs. If the Korean
King changes the way of wearing his top- (
Knot the new style of coiffure is spoken of j
as ''pro-American" hair-dressing; a new \
newspaper projected in Seoul is called a j
pro-American venture and a Korean j
privy councilor is stigmatized as a "pro- j
American" statesman.
A DOUBTFUL DOCUMENT.
Colonel Fred Or ant Says His Father
Sever, Took the Fledge.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 29.â j
Herald this morning says: A letter read j
by H. D. Estabrook of Chicago at a ban- '
quet given in Galena, 111., last Monday, j
which Mr. Estabrook said was written by
General John A. Ratvlins to General Grant
during the siege of Yicksburg, was pub
lished in yesterday's Herald. The letter
warned General Grant to restrain; his i
drinking " habits. It referred to a pledge
made by General Grant and stated:
"Your only salvation depends upon your
strict adherence to that pledge."'
A Herald â  reporter * saw Colonel Fred
Grant at his home yesterday and showed
him the published letter. He read it, and
after a pause remarked, "Well, 1 don't see
anything in that."
"Do you know whether General Grant
ever received this letter?"
"I was with him during the siege of
Vicksburg,'' Colonel Grant replied, "and
in the same tent. Ido not believe the let
ter was ever written. I know my father
never received it. If that letter was writ
ten by General Rawlins to my father how
is it that a man in Galena now has pos
session of it, and how is it that now, after
a period of thirty -three years, its existence
is first made known to the public? It is
true that my father drank during his ser
vice as a commander, and that frequently
gifts of wine were sent to him by iriends.
But is it likely that he would have made a
pie:ige to a subordinate officer, a member
of his staff, not to drink?"
TIRED OF SOLDIERING.
Case of a Young Lieutenant Whose Mili

WASHINGTON, D. C. April 29.âSec
ond-Lieutenant Clarence E. Lang, Sec
ond Artillery, the young army officer
whose case bas been much commented
UDon, has been granted an extension of
bis sick leave for one month.
Lieutenant Lang's application for re
tirement is still in abeyance, but on the
expiration of the extended leave he will
be subjected to another examination to
determine bio mental and physical condi
tion. His wife was at the War Depart
ment recently in company with Repre
sentative Burton of Ohio, who appointed
Lang to the military academy, and she is
apparently as anxious as her husband to
have his application for retirement acted
on favorably.
.Lieutenant Lang was married on the
day of his graduation to the daughter of a
commissary sergeant at West Point. Later
Lieutenant Lang and his bride came into
public view through mysterious happen
ings about their residence and allegations
that the young couple were snuboed by
society. Lieutenant Lang's application
for retirement on account of illness was
not granted, but he was given a sick leave.
The medical report of tne examination
shows that he is suffering from some ner
vous complaint.
STRANGE SUDDEN DEATHS
Three Neighbors in a New Jer
sey Village Die in a Myste
rious Manner.
It Is Believed They Were Poisoned
by Drinking Water From an
Old Weil.
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., April 29.â
Thiee mysterious deaths which occurred
Sunday night have stirred the residents of
the little village of Port Republic to a
high pitch of excitement. If the theory
of villagers be correct the autopsies which
County Physician Souder is to hold to-day
will reveal the fact that the dead persons
â two women and one man â came to their
death by poisoning, presumably by drink
ing the water from U weli in the vicinity
of their homes.
The first death, that of Mrs. Jane Hover,
occurred about 6 o'clock Sunday night.
Sne was engaged in the kitchen and was
suddenly attacked with convulsions. She
fell to the floor, and before her daughter
could reach her side she was dead.
At about the same time Mrs. JMizabeth
Corre, Mrs. Hover'a next-door neighbor
started to walK to the latter's house. Sh<
had gone but a few feet from her doo:
when she was also stricken with convul
sions and fell to the ground and died al
most instantly.
Less than an hour later David Cole, i
wealthy young farmer who lived a shor
distance away, was attacked in an exactl]
similar manner, and dropped dead in th<
presence of his wife, whom he marriec
only a few months ago.
All of the stricken people were ap
parently in the best of health prior to th'i
sudden attack, and this caused the theon
of poisoning. In the vicinity of the deso
lated homes there is an old well, and it i
believed that the water in this has becomi
poisoned in some unknown way and tha
the stricken persons drank of it. Sample
of the water will be submitted to a chemi
cal analysis.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, APRIL 30, 1896.
FLOOD FOLLOWS
THE CYCLONE.
A Regular Deluge in the
Dakotas and Western
Minnesota.
VAST AREA INUNDATED.
Over Thirty Persons Injured by
the Twister, Some of Whom
Will Die.
A LITTLE TOWN ANNIHILATED.
Nothing Left to Show That It Ever
Existedâ Great Damage to Crops
and Livestock.
ST. PAUL, Minn., April 29.â T0-night's
reports indicate that a regular deluge of
rain has been falling in tne Dakotas and
Western Minnesota to-day. Miles of land
along the Upper Mississippi and Red
River are under water, and it wHI be ten
days before any seeding can be d*one.
Along the Red River not more than 2 per
cent of the crop has been put in.
The cyclone, meager reports of which
came in last night, struck between Fargo
and Spencer, S. D., and was said to be
heading for the latter place, but fortu
nately passed several miles north, head
ing in a northeasterly direction^ and for
eiehteen miles laid waste to everything in
its path.
The country being level as a floor the
monster could be seen coming for miles,
which accounts for the few fatalities. In
its track, which was a mile wide, the de
struction was complete. Not a vestige
of any living thing was left. Farmhouse
after farmhouse was completely wiped out.
Sixteen miles northeast of Mitchell the
little town of Epipnany was located, but
nothing remains to show that it ever ex
isted. Here fifteen people were seriously
injured, several fatally. The latest vic
tims, who may recover, are William Kee
ger, Mrs. Gibson and Mrs, Gilser.
Ne estimate of damage to crops and live
stock and property is given, but it is known
to be large.
The storm was headed for Madison, but
on its arrival there had spent its fury and
the damage was light. Physicians from
Spencer, Montrose and other adjacent
towns were summoned and relief parties
sent out. The wounded were given the
best of care. The number of victims in
jured is rapidly growing, and will probably
reach over thirty.
THE MARQUETTE STATUE
It Is Officially Presented To and
Accepted By the
Senate.
Glowing Tributes to the Memory of
the Worthy Priest Are Paid by
Eloquent Srnators.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 29.â The
statue of Father Marquette, placed by the
State of Wisconsin in the National Hall of
Statuary in the Capitol, was to-day offi
cially presented to and accepted by the
Senate. EuJogies of the good priest were
pronounced by the two Wisconsin Sena
tors, Wilson and Vilas, by Kyle of South
Dakota and by Palmer of Illinois.
Mitchell spoke of the Jesuits in North
America as "transcendent heroes of the
advancing army of civilization," and de
scribed Father Marquette as the one great
historic character of Wisconsin, whose
name would shine the brighter as time
goes on.
Vilas spoke of him as the gentle, high
souled, fearless priest and preacher; the
discoverer of the Mississippi; a nobleman
with soul lifted up to God ; a gentle enthu
siast; a man to do without boasting the
deeds that heroes do, and said it was of
such as he that Congress spoke when it
marked for this special honor (a place in
Statuary Hall) persons illustrious of
historic renown.
Kyle praised the saintly character and
unselfishness of Father Marquette and
said that he had given his life for those he
loved: and Mr. Palmer spoke of him as
the representative of courage, resolution
and devotion to the elevation of humanity.
There was no expression of opposition to
the acceptance of the statue.
After this matter was disposed of the
naval appropriation bill was taken up and
the remainder of the session was given up
to political speeches.
Teller (R.) of Colorado announced in
unmistakable terms his resolution to
break away from the Republican party if
the action in the St. Louis convention did
not suit his views and sentiments on the
silver question, while Sherman (R.) of
Ohio declared his readiness to conform his
action on that question to the decision of
the American people at the polls next
November.
Without action on the naval bill the
Senate at 6 p. m. adjourned.
REVENUES AND EXPENSES.
\ A. Subject That la Cauaing Murh 2>iÂ«
cuation in the Houae.
WASHINGTON, D. C. April 29.-The
House was plunged almost immediately
after it assembled for to-day's session into
a mild and diminutive, in respect of
length, repetition of the debate in the Sen
ate yesterday regarding the revenues and
expenditures of tbe Government.
McCormick (R.) of New York aaked con
sideration of a bill for a lighthouse on
Orient Point, Long Island, which led
Do-kery (D.) of Missouri to warn the
House against appropriating money for
an improvement that was not absolutely
indispensable.
The direct appropriations at this term
of Congress, he figured up, would be Â§512 -
000,000, and of contracts authorized to be
entered into, $93,541,000, making the grand
total for which this Congress would be re
sponsible at this term of Congress over
$005,000,000. He said current revenue was
not equal to current expenditures, and
had not been at any time during the term
of this administration, and he pleaded in
no spirit of partisanship for careful
scrutiny of appropriation bills for the pro
tection of the treasury.
Dingley(R.) of Maine, chairman of the
Committee on Ways and Means, responded
to the statement of Dockery, and analyzed
the figures he had given.
He asserted that the appropriations at
this session of Congress for current ex
penditures would not exceed $450,000,000
and the amount that must be paid by
taxation would not exceed ?360 000,000, the
expenses of the Postoffice Department |
being met by the postal receipts. While
it was true that more revenue was in
urgent need Dingley contended that Con
gress was doing as well as it could in the
matter of appropriations in view of the
needs of the Government and of the
country.
McCormick's bill met objection and was
not considered.
The report of Elections Committee No.
3 in the contest of Giles Otis Pearce (In
dependent Labor) vs. John C. Bell (Popu
list and Democrat), from the Second
District of Colorado, confirming Bell's
ricunt to the seat, was agreed to.
The remainder of the day was spent in
committee of the whole in discussing the
bankruptcy bill, that bill being supported
by Connelly (It.) of Illinois and an
tagonized by Messrs. W. A. Stone (R.)of
Pennsylvania, Newlands (Silver) of
Nevada and Broderick R. of Kansas.
Newlands made a 16 to 1 silver speech,
asserting that that alone would afford sub
stantial relief.
At 5:05 the House adjourned until to
morrow. _^____________
Commander Walker at Tacoma.
TACOMA, Wash., April 29.â Colonel
Ivan N. Walker, commauder-in-chief of
the Grand Army of the Republic, and
party arrived here this afternoon from
Seattle. They were met by a large dele
gation from the several army posts, and a
reception was tendered them this evening.
Colonel Walker says the pension bill
which passed the House yesterday meets
the approval of the Grand Army of the
Republic, and that he had something to
do with bringing about the passage of the
bill.
THROWN INTO PIT RIVER
Deputy Fish Commissioner Bass
Has a Narrow Escape
From Drowning.
The Ferry-Eoat Capsized by the Rag
ing TorrentâSpan of Horses
and Wagon Lost.
REDDING, Cal., April 29.â Seymour
Bass, Deputy United States Fish Commis
sioner at Baird, a pretty little spot on the
McCloud River, came near being drowned
in Pit River Tuesday evening. Mr. Bass
had baen in Redding attending the Odd
Fellows' celebration, and left this city on
Tuesday for his home. He drove a span
of horses attached to a light spring wagon.
With him were his two sons ana James
Cessna of this city, who was on his way
to Copper City to attend to some mining
business.
It was about 6 o'clock when the four
reached the Pit River ferry. It was storm
ing somewhat at the time, and tne heaw
rains of the several days previous had
converted the Pit River into a raging tor
rent. The water was running like a mill
race when Bass and his companions
boarded the ferry-boat. When the middle
of the stream had been reached one of the
cables attached to the ferry broke on ac
count of the severe strain from the force
of the water and the la:ge boat slowly
turned over.
One of Bass' boys retained his presence
of mind, and as the boat turned he walked
over it and stood safe and rode on the bot
tom when she had rolled over. Cessna
and the other boy slipped into the water,
but soon caught hold and pulled them
selves into the capsized boat. Bass was
less fortunate. He was carried some dis
tance nwav and into an eddy. The circling
water took him like a leaf and with a few
whirls he sank. Twice he Bank beneath
the surface of the water and arose. As he
arose '.o the surface the second time tue
capsized boat, which had gone nearly to
the opposite shore, drifted back, and his
companions rescued him just as he was
going down for the third and, perhaps,
last lime.
After hia rescue Bass remained in an
unconscious condition for about two hours
and bis companions thought he would not
recover. Bui by hard work, however, he
was brought back to consciousness and at
length the shore was reached. The
horses and wagon were carried down the
stream for about 200 yards, when the ani
mals got loose from the vehicle. The
horses were carried on down the stream
at a rapid rate and when last seen were
some three miles below the ferry. They
no doubt were drowned. It was a thrilling
experience, and one from which it may
take some time for Mr. Bass to recover.

DROWNED IN THE SACRAMENTO.
Uoat Upset and Two Prospector* Swept
Down the Hirer.
REDDING, Cal., April 29.â The Sacra
mento River claimed two victims yester
day. James Davis and John Heinatz,
miners, were drowned in the Sacramento
River at Slatonis station, a point on the
railroad four miles above Delta and forty
five miles from Redding.
The men had been prospecting in the
hills on the east side of the river and had
been across after supplies.
They attempted to recross in a small row
boat. The river was running swiftly, and
the two encountered a strong current
when about three-quarters of the way
across, and the boat capsized. The un
fortunate men attempted to right the boat,
but the current was so swift it washed
them away, and their bodies floated down
the stream. Up to the present writing
their bodies have not been found, though
search was made.
Davis was an aged man, about 78 or 79
years old. and HeinaU was27years of age,
a native of Texas. Neither have relatives
in this country, and they have no effecte
other than a lot of prospecting implements.
Coroner Earnest was notiried yesterday,
and an attempt will be made to recover
the bodies if possible.

...Double Tragedy at Seattle.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 29.â Crazed by
jealousy, fancied and otherwise, Albert
Keroy, a negro, 35 years old, and a waiter
at the Rainier Grand Hotel, this morning
murdered his wife Julia, and then killed
himself. Both were in bed at the time,
and the presumption is that the Â«voman
was killed while she was asleep, being shot
in the temple with a small caliber revolver.
Keroy then turned the weapon upon him
self, sending a bullet into his brain.

PORT HARFORD
Delightful Trip Through a
Rich Agricultural
Region.
PARTAKE OF A FEAST.
Treated to a Barbecue Under the
Big Trees at Sycamore
Spriogs.
ANNUAL BALL AT THE RAMONA
Treasurer Henry Martin's Success as a
Premier Danseuse â A Meek
Trial.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Cal., April 29.â
The Native Sons' itinerary to-day in
cluded an excursion to Port Harford,
a barbecue at Sycamore Springs and
the annual <!iand Parlor ball. To-morrow
the njnin business session, with the elec
tions, will be held. The banquet in the
â¢vening will be the concluding feature of
the week # with the exception of the Fri
day excursion through the rich agricul
tural rogion to Los Oiivos.
At 10 o'clock this forenoon a special
train started with the delegates and sev
eral hundred others for Port Harford and
the beautiful harbor, which is praised by
every sjiipping man on the coast.
From 200 to 30C of the residents went in
their own carriages and on horseback, and
the visitors had every rig that is owned by
the liverymen of this city. It was a glori
ous excursion. In the long train there
were three observation cars, which afforded
the delegates an excellent opportunity to
see the country. These cars were open on
all sides, and Grand Treasurer Henry Mar
tin occupied one of them, as the entrance
way was more commodious than in the
other cars.
An incident that caused continual in
terest on the seven-mile run to the springs
was contributed by two boys on horse
back. Tne highway runs along the Jine of
the railroad, through a green and pic
turesque region, and the boys, lads of 12
or 14, raced with the train the entire dis
tance. The youngsters made their horses
almost fly through the air, and ti:eir horse
manship was of the highest order. Twice
the train slowed ud, and the boys stayed
with it, but when the engineer spurted up
at a rate of twenty or twenty-five miles an
hour the horses were also in the race.
At Port Harford ihe spectacle of fisher
men hauling in salmon three feet long
was of secondary interest only to that of
Milk Inspector Dockery riding along the
wharf on a railroad tricycle. Some of the
natives made up dancing sets, and the
ponderous and splintered planks of the
dim old wharf felt a light and merry tread
that they had not known before.
W:ien the excursionists returned to
Sycamore Springs the managers of the
barbecue had long rows of tables arranged
under the trees, and the beef and the
beverages were soon ready. There was
room enough for all, and it was a happy
and thoroughly pleased party that ate
under the huge old sycamores.
The barbecue, like every other feature of
this California carnival ot hospitality, was
managed with exceptional success. Stroll
ing about the natural mountain park was
a pleasure for hundreds when the dancing
pavilion could hold no more. There was
little room for the dancers at any time,
but there was less than ever when the
grand officers appeared and announced,
"The candidates' dance."
Henry Martin, the 350-pound corner
s-tune of the order, was floor manager, and
a dance was never managed with more en
ergy. The band began the college lancers,
Wtaen the grand treasurer jumped into the
arena and roared: "Get your partners,
gentlemen." There were ncjladies in this
dance. Louis F. Byington of San Fran
cisco danced with Edwin A. Meserve of
Los Angeles, M. D. Garratt of San Fran
cisco was the partner of Frank Mattisonof
Santa Cruz, and Dr. Hyde, A. P. Brady of
Grass Valley, Delegate Zabala of Salinas
and nearly all the other candidates were
in the ring.
Henry Martin, the floor manager, danced
and hopped and jumped. He laughed
and shouted and cheered. He swung his
cane, and clapped his hands and hurried
the dancers this way and that and he was
a whole good-natured and perspirinsr cir
cus. The band played "' Upidee I Dee I
Da," and that just 5-uited Mr. Martin, who
threw his familiar straw hat back on his
Lead, poised his cane with his left hand,
while beating time with his right, and
danced as lightly and merrily as a Native
Eon should always dance. He wore a
blue badge and the badge went waving to
the tune of the lively "Upidce." The
crowd surged closer and closar and closer.
There was hardly space for the candidates
to turn, but Mr. Martin founds room and
he danced his happy "Vpidee." All in
the set went around blithely in their circle,
all having partners but the jovial Martin,
who applauded and directed and managed
the affair, laughing gloriously and ever ex
uberant in his liitie side performance of
â¢'Upidee I Dee I Da."
The crowd roared In amusement. Henry
C. Gesford of Napa. tall and bewhiskered,
MUtezed his way through the throng.
Martin caught him and had a partner.
Away they whirled, and the audience had
to give room, and Martin and C. Gesford
hopped and skipped and whirled and r;m
In the rollicking time of "Upidee." Mr.
Martin perspired, but still he danced. His
hat went down on the corner of his fore-
head, but still he danced and he laughed
an "Upidee." And his laugh was echoed
by all who cou'd see or hoar. It was the
merriest day of Sycamore Springs. Clu-ers
and whistles and shrieks of applause went
up as Mr. Mftitin and liis partner madly
pranceu their "Upidee."
John T. Greany of San Francisco then
started a candidates' footrace on the level
ground near t lie pavilion. The first race
was for grand trustee, in which were en
tered Dunbar, Oassin and McNoble, Dun
bar winning by a iead of six inches. For
grand orator Trustees Mattison, Byin-^ton
and Meserve entered, and after a dead heat
Meserve won. For outside sentinel Leath
ers, Fiedler and Bouquet entered. Fiedler
won. For inside sentinel Van Orden had
to ran alone. Henry S. Martin for -jrand
treasurer ran aeainst time and covered
twenty-five yards in eight seconds.
The Natives had a mock trial last night
at the Ramon a, the case being that of the
People of the State of California vs. John
Doe Miller. W. H. Miller was charged by
Mr. Dennery with having unlawfully and
maliciously taken, stolen and carried
away a sausage made of dog meat. The
prisoner was defended by Attorneys Frank
Coombs and Eugene F. Bert, Carroll Cook
and P. Zabala represented the people;
Percy V. Long was clerk of the court and
Fred W. Lees was the detective. The Dris-
oner was brought into court heavily man
acled. His attorneys immediately regis
tered strenuous objections to such s pro
ceeding and the court ordered the man
acles cast off. The jury was: Messrs.
Garratt, Tathan, DÂ» Golia* Morgan, Clark,
Levy, Johnton, Noble, Cassin, Gesford and
Fitzgerald.
Circumstantial evidence tended to show
tnat Miller had stolen the sausage. 2. P.
Pockery was called as a meat and milk ex
pert. Mr. Dockery had some trouble in
telling the dog's variety. He finally con
cluded it had been a Newfoundland. The
case was argued ana given to the jury.
Tbe body was just about to return a ver
dict of 'â¢guilty," when John Leathers, a
discharged juryman, confessed to the theft.
The annual ball was held at the Ramona
Hotel parlors this evening.
The ballroom was beautifully decorated.
Many beautiful costumes were displayed
by the young ladies of San Luis Obispo,
who made this their special part of the
week's celebration. Some of these were:
Mrs. John E. Childs, black watered silk
with trimmings and pearls; Miss Elena
Childs, white mull and blue forget-me
nots; Mrs. Harry Livingston, lemon
colored satin with white passementerie
trimmings and diamonds; Miss Hinda
Greenberg, white dotted Swiss; Miss
Jennie Blake, black satin with yellow
ribbons and California poppies; Miss Lulu
Egan, pale blue organdie; Miss Carrie
Dana, white India silk trimmed with
chiffon; Miss Minnie Blake, white bro
caded silk; Miss Carrie Blake, yel
low brocaded silk trimmed with black
chiffon; Miss Mollie Norcross, white dot
ted Swiss, trimmed with scarlet ribbons;
Miss Carlotta Childs, pink dotted Swiss,
with pink satin ribbon and flowers; Miss
de la Guerra, Nile green silk; Miss Min
nie Egan, Nile green, brocaded silk; Miss
Dicie Grover, blue dimity; Miss Amanda
Blake, cream China silk; Miss Etbel Jack,
silk China crepe; Mrs. E. P. Rogers, old
rose silk; Miss Gertie Sinsheimer, white
brocaded silk; Mrs. R. E. Jack, black silk
and diamonds; Mrs. Ernest Graves, bottle
green silk and diamonds.
The floor manager of the ball was E. M.
Payne. He was assisted by R. M. de la
Guerra, F. A. Dorn, J. Lamy, J. B. Blake,
A. Robinson and J. W. O'Sullivan. The
reception committee was composed of J.
F. Fielder, T. T. Crittenden, T. J. Bowen,
P. J. McCaffrey, H. E. McKennon, Richard
Leland, F. Burke, Charles Childd, W. B.
Staniford and J. L. Anderson.
SANTA ROSA SENSATION
Mark L. McDonald Sued by an
Attorney for Wesley
Mock.
Pay Demanded for Services in Opposing
the City's New Water
System.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., April 29.â A mild
sensation was created here this afternoon
â when it was learned that Mark L. Mc-
Donald had been sued for nearly $1000 by
one of the attorneys for Wesley Mock in
the celebrated case of Mock vs. The City
of Santa Rosa.
It has long been an open secret here that
the Santa Rosa Water Company, of which
Mark L. McDonald is president, was pay-
in~ the bills in the long and expensive liti
gation to prevent the city from accepting
and using the new water system. The
last phase of this bitter legal fight was the
petition of the plaintiff for an interlocu
tory injunction restraining the city from
accepting the completed water system
from the contractors.
The matter was heard by Judge Dainger
field early in April. He took the case
under advisement, and a decision is
looked for daily. More than a week was
spent in the areunient* Attorney Lynch
for the plaintiff c onsuming about four days
in explaning to the court his view?.
C. S. Forquar of Petaluma has also been
one of Mr. .Mock's attorneys in this case,
and he avers that his services were reas
onably worth $1000, of which only $162 has
been paid, and he having assigned his
claim to George M. Brush, the latter gen
tleman now seeks to recover ;he balance
due from the president of the Santa Rosa
Water Company.
SAN PEDRO ITS CHOICE
The Santa Fe Railway Com
pany Declares for the
People's Harbor.
Coast Officials Instructed to Exert
Their Influence Against
Santa Monica.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 29.â 1n the
great Santa Monica-San Pedro harbor
fight the position of the Santa Fe railway
system has not been clearly defined here
tofore. It was supposed that its manage
ment would favor San Pedro, but this, it
seems, has only been conjecture and has
been denied by persons seemingly in a
position to know. Now, however, all sur
. raises have been set at rest, for it is stated
on the authority of persons connected with I
the management that the influence of the
Santa Fe Company will from now on be
thrown to San Pedro.
Tnis morning instructions were received
at the general offices from Chicago that
any effort to help the cause of Sun Pedro
would be approved. The friends of San
Pedro are jubilant over this new and
strong influence to defeat the Santa Mon
ica harbor steal for the especial benefit of
Huntingdon. New life seems to be infused,
into the fight for San Pedro all alon^: the
line, and a change at Washington in favor
of the real harbor on this coast is antici
pated.

Altogether about 1000 skins have been
taken. Six fatalities comprise the full list
of accidents.

PHOENIX, Ariz., April 29. â Arizona
goes against McKinley. The most excit

was that of the Republicans to-day. A
contest was waged from 2 until 9 o'clock,
when sixty-eight delegates, sixty-two of
whom were from Maricopa, Pima and
Yavapai contested delegations, let in with
half a vote each, left the convention. The
fight was for McKinley instructions, but
the Ohioan's forces lost and then departed.
Bix delegates to St. Louis, all uninstructed,
were chosen by the remaining 106 dele
pates, being representatives from each of
the twelve counties in the Territory. The
bolters will hold a convention to-morrow.

LOS ANGELES PRIMARIES.
Lindley and Sheldon Gain a Majority of
the Delegates.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 29.â The
immediate and chief significance of the
Republican caucuses last night and the
primaries this afternoon is based on t!>e
question of who shall represent this Con
gressional district at St. Louis, and who
shall be delegate-at-large from this end of
the State to the National Convention.
Harvey Lindley, who was defeated by
Marion Cannon in 1892, has been making
plans for some time with the view of go
ing to St. Louis as district delegate, and
ex-Governor Sheldon of Pasadena has
been in the hands of his friends as dele
gate-at-large. The Times here, a Repub
lican morning newspaper, sniffing the
battle from afar, has waged unrelenting
warfare on the aspirations of both gentle
men, but with indifferent results, i\s the
aciion of the caucuses and the vote to-day
show.
There has been no question for weeks
but that the McKiniev sentiment was
dominant and none but McKinley men
were to be placed on guard. But as to
who would go to St. Louis was quite an
other matter.
The contest that has been wasred here
has generally been designated as tbe old
"Otis-Lindley right," for it seems that the
Time* oppose! Lindley in his race for Co
ngress. Caucuses were held all over tin
city last night and there was marked har
mony everywhere except in the Third
Wardâ Lindlev'a home. Here there was
a split, and to-day there were two dole
gate tickets in the tield. The Lindley op
position ticket was headed, "Third \Vanl
(n:iti- Lindley)â For President, William
McKinley.'* The regular caucus ticket in
this, like all of the others, was headed,
"For President, William McKinley; regu
lar caucus ticket."
The polling-place in the Third Ward
was the set ne of great bustle all afternoon
with a string of voters reaching far out
into the street. The "regular" caucus
ticket won easily, and thus the Times'
light was completely lost.
At the caucusses lost night McKinley
resolutions were passed in all tlie wards
except the Eighth. Sheldon will now get
the indorsement from this district, and
will probably defeat U. S. Grant Jr. of San
Diego for the position of delegate-at-large.
The Assembly conventions occur next
Saturday, when delegates to the Sacra
mento convention will be chosen.
OREGON GOLDITES,
Judge Xorthup to Hun Against Con
gressman Ellin.
PORTLAND, Ok., April 29.â The re
nomination of Representative W. R. Ellis,
the free-silver advocate of Eastern Oregon
from the Second District, was a bitter pill
to the believers in "hound 1 ' money, and
was claimed to be a misrepresentation o!
a majority of the Republicans of the dis
trict. Almost immediately afterward a
convention movement t" put up a "sound"
money candidate was started, and it soon
assumed definite shape in the selection of
Henry H. Northup, County Judge of this
county, provided he would" accept. Judge
Northup^s acceptance was filed to-day at
Salem. Apparently about two-thirds of
the signers are Republicans and one-third
Democrats. About TOO names are attached
to the petition. The platform on which
Judge Northup will run is strictly "sound"
money.
SPOKANE REPUBLICANS.
State Convention Delegates Fledged to an
Anti-Silver Man.
SPOKANE, Wahh., April 29.â The Re
publican convention to-day was captured
by Wilson menâ the friends of Senator
Wilsonâ assisted by the A. P. A.'s. At
torney-General Jones, one of the best
known men in the State and a popular ex
ponent of the free-silver doctrine, was de
feated for chairman. A resolution favor
ine free silver was adopted and another
binding the party to support the St. Louis
nominee.
The delegates to the State Convention
were instructed to vote for Harry L. Wil
son for delegate to St. Louis. Wilson is
not a free-silv*r man and does not repre
sent the sentiments of his party in East
ern Washington. The free-silver Republi
cans are irate, and will, it is s-aid, support
the Democratic National ticket if it nomi
nates a free-silver man on a free-silver
platform.

LAKEPORT, Cal., April 29.â The Demo

CARPENTERIA BURGLARS.
Two Morphine Victims Caught ISreakina
Into a 'â  Drugstore.
SANTA BARBARA, ; Cal., April 29.â
Two morp'.iine ''fiends," a man named
Lafayette and a woman known as Lulu
Dormer, last night attempted to rob the
drugstore of Dr. Marquis at Carpenteria.
A neighbor named Sharkey was aroused
by the noise made in forcing the door of
the drugstore, and fired upon them. The
woman surrendered, but her companion
escaped. It is believed the man was

ROBBERY AT BATES.
A. Late Resident of Folaom la Terrorising
the Ranchers.
MADERA, Cal., April 29.â Samuel
Prewett from Bates to-day brought to
Sheriff Westfall a note from a man named
Allison requesting that he come immedi
ately to Bates for the purpose of arresting
a man who had robbed him of a gold watch
and chain valued at $210 and a lot of money
he had on his person. He gave a slight
description of the individual, which corre
sponds in size and appearance to William
Liverone, who has just been released from
Jolsom on a two-year term for grand lar
ceny and is somewhere in the vicinity of
the mountains.
There was an attempt last week to rob
two farmers who were riding along in a
wagon, but the shots fired by the robbers
scared the horses into a run and the men
escaped unharmed. This attempt was
kept quiet by the officers in order that
they might ascertain who was committing
the depredations, as Clif Regan and his
followers are again in the eastern portion
of the county and the officers entertain
hope of capturing them before they escape.
The officers left im mediately for the scene
of the robbery and the work of tracking
the law-breakers will begin in the morn
ing.

ARRAIGNED AT VISALIA.
The Examination of Lovren and
Ardell Begun in the Jus
tices' Court.
Obie Britt Repeats His Confession Re
lating to the G.shen Train
Robbery.
VISALIA, Cal., April 29.â Si Lovren
and Charles Ardeil, accused of complicity
in the attempted Southern Pacific train
robbery near Goshen last month, which
resulted in the killing of Outlaw Dan Mc-
Cail, were arraigned to-day before Justice
Holaen.
Deputy Sheriff G. V. Reed was the first
witness. He detailed the circumstances of
the attempt made by McCaii on the night
of the 18th of March to board the Southern
Pacific train near Goshen and his subse
quent deatti. Counsel for the defense
asked Reed no que?tiuns.
Obie Britt followed and repeated his
former confession, except that nothing re
lating to Lovren and Ardell was said.
Counsel for the prosecution were very
careful to prevent mention of the prison
ers' names.
James L. Pattee, a violin-player, testified
that Lovren on the morning of March 18
gave liim 35 cents with which to buy red
gauze, wanted to put around two lanterns
for red lights. Not rinding the cloth at a
store, he returned the money to Lovren.
The latter went out, returning in twenty
minutes with a bundle. About that time
McCaU came in and took off his overcoat.
McCaii, Hoss and Lovren then examined
their Rifles. McCaii, after sighting a rifle,
seemed well ple.tsed with it.
The prosecution is proceeding cau
tiously. The case went over until to
morrov.

longing to the Indian staling schooner

CARSON'S MINT
SCANDAL GROWS
Heney, the Convicted Bul
lion Thief, Confesses
in Prison.
TREACHERY IS REPAID.
Induced to Talk After He Had
Been Sacrificed by His
Accomplices.
GREATER THEFTS EXPOSED.
He Implicates a Pr eminent Man Who
Had Not Been Suspect d
Heretofore.
CARSON, Nev., April 29.â 1t is now
generally understood that James Heney,
the convicted bullion thief, has told every
thing he knows about the Mint shortage.
While the Government officials and attor
neys decline to talk on the subject a Call
correspondent is able to state positively
that Heney made a full confession in the
presence of witnesses and the Govern
ment officials have it in black and white.
This document contains some very start
ling accusations in connection with the
Mint cases and involves bigger game than
Jones. It is doubtful, however, that the
Government will put Heney on the stand,
as its counsel feels confident of winning
the case without his testimony.
Heney's wife has been instrumental in
inducing her husband to talk. She real
ized that he had been sold out and sac
rificed in the interest of his accomplices,
and openly threatened to tell everything
she knew if her husband did not talk.
Inspector Mason gave the lirst hint of
the corning storm by saying to-day that
Jones had a confederate in the mint. He
had learned this by a conversation with
Heney in the prison. Woodburn, counsel
for th? defense, attempted to draw out
moii- from this intimation, but Clark, for
tt:e Government, arose and warned him
tliat if he called for information he would
get all of it and no more questions were
asked.
It has developed that six additional
bogus melts were made in the cupel-room,
and it is supposed that Heney gave the
Government the tip how to secure the evi
dence. Mason had already found the alter
ations in the books, and the new evidence
tends to snow that suspect Jones used the
same melts to serve a double purpose and
they were worked in twice in the books.
Ma?on declines to say who the confederate
of Heney was, but says he has not pre
viously been even .suspected.

PRAYED FOR THE CONSUL
Mrs. Emma Booth-Tucker Was
Unable to Attend the
Meeting.
Much Enthusiasm as Wtll as Regret
and Sympathy Manifested by
the Salvationists.
Metropolitan Temple rang and echoed
with Salvation Aimy halleluiahs last
night, and again the large hall was
thronged with earnest soldiers of salva
tion. This second meeting of welcome to
Consul Emma Booth-Tucker was inspir
ing, but the object of the inspiration was
absent, suffering on a bed of sickness.
Presiding oilicer Brik-adier Keppel said
that since Mrs. Booth-Tucker's appearance
on the platform Tuesday night she had
been in great pain, but hoped to be able to
be present at tbe auxiliary meeting in the
temple, which takes place this afternoon
at 3 o'clock.
The meeting was opened by the song,
"I have read of men of fate," and a
prayer v,-as offered by Mrs. Keppel: "We
pray that thou may lay thy tender, lov
ing hand upon our beloved consul to
night and comfort her and make her
well."
As the clear voice of the one praying:
touched the hearts of those listening, a
wave of audible supplication passed across
the hall, out of which rose the "Hear, 0
Lord," and "amens" of the sincere suppli
ants.
The hymn "Calvary" was suns and
Major Malan offered a prayer.
"Because we are deprived of our consul, "
said Brigadier Keppei, "we must fall back
on her hallelujah escorts. Major Lewis and
Major Malan. Captain Bernard will sing
us a song composed by the consul herself
â a sonc that will make the devil hum."
And in his pleasant barytone Captain
Bernard sang "I Am Climbing Up the
Go'den Stairs to Glory."
Major L,ewis began her remarks by tell
ing the story of a descent she once made
into a coal mine. She graphically pictured
the dangers of entering such places, and
compared the mission of the Salvation
Army to that of the coal-miner who goes
down into the depths that lie may brine
forth the shining and valuable mineral.
"vVe go down, not to get inanimate bits of
coal," said she, "but glorious shining
souls."
She spoke of the great good the army
was doing in all parts of the world, lift
ing up a class of mankind that had never
been up before.
At the conclusion of the meeting Major
Malan sang, accompanied by Major Lewis.
He is noted for his interjections while
singing, and bore out his reputation in
the song last night. Tbe entire audience
soon caught the air and joined in the
chorus.
Brigadier Keppel announced that for
the meeting to-night an admittance of 10
cents would have to be asked to pay the
expenses of the hall.
Luck of a Spokane Prospector.
SPOKANE, Wash., April 29.â Martin

Lookout Mountain, on the Columbia
River. He discovered a huge bowlder of
ore weighing hilly sixty thousand tons,
from which assays were made to-day run
ning as high as $63 to the ton in* gold.
The bowlder is evidently a slide from the
mountain. Neilly is wild with joy over
liis pood luck.

REDWOOD CITY, Cal., April 29.â
The coronation of San Mateo County's
Queen of Roses this evening in
Redwood City was a splendid sue
The Coronation of the Floral Queen of San Mateo County Last Evening in Alhambra Theater at
Redwood City, Which Was Followed by a Grand Coronation Ball.
cess. The scene presented in the
Alhambra Theater when the ceremonies
began was really too pretty to attempt to
put the half of it in cold and colorless
type. It was a scene of color â a grand
color schemeâ therein lay its strongest
point when viewed as a whole picture.
The theater itself has a very pleasing in
terior, being finished in the natural woods,
with huge roof timbers devoid of disfig-
uring plaster or paintâ all of which offered
an excellent background for the decorative
committee's work. They used only natu
ral flowers, ferns and evergreens, mingled
with much good taste â and the effect was
charming. The royal promenade, from the
rear entrance to the throne on the stage,
was marked off by long garlands of ever
green and deep-red roses. Inside its sacred
limits no plebeian mortal dare set dese
crating 100t â until the coronation services
â were over and the coronation ball in prog
ress.
At 9 o'clock the orchestra was in place,
the hall was crowded with promenaders in
full evening dress, the galleries with fasci
nated spectators. A sentinel, trumpet in
hand, in knee breeches and full court cos
tume, stood motionless at the rear of the
hall in the center of the royal promenade.
On either side and a little behind him,
stood two other lads, dressed as court
pages. Both of these had trumpets. All
three stood motionless, expectant. Then
& signal was given. Her royal Majesty,
Queen Lillian Neuman, and suite, are
about to appear.
The sentinel pipes his trumpet, the or
chestra ceases. The sentinel strides slowly
forward, trumpet to lips, then turns,
walks half way back and meets his pages.
They are facing the outer door of the hall
and all three bow low as it opens. All
eyes look to the open door. Two wee
maidens enter, scattering before them,
from fuJl baskets on their arms, handfuls
of Mowers that sell for $5 a dozen to-day in
New York or Chicago.
Behind them is the Queen, led forward
by Prime Minister George Gilchrist. She
is beautiful; he is stately and gallant.
Her gown is of dazzling whiteness, of
heavy white corded silk to be exact. From
the shoulders hangs the ermine of royalty.
~t is of crimson velvet and trimmed with
rf-hite ermine, spotted at regular inter
vals â this ermine trimmingâ with dots of
Mack. Tut Medici collar and the bouf
fant sleeves comy>lete a rough description
of a handsome costume that bespeaks
royalty almost as much from its simpli
city as from its beauty. She looks every
every inch a queenâ though her reign will
be brief enough, alas ! So think the merry
makers, at all events, regretful that all
this brightness, this color, these flowers
and the music ana the dancing may not
last forever. In the old engravings you
have seen Sir Walter Raleigh-take *the
beard from his chin and cheeks and you
have Pnnce Gilchrist, Prime Minister to
the Queen of San Mateo County's floral
festival.
_ Now the orchestra plays the W. M. B.
Grand March and the royal suite moves
with stately tread toward the throne. A
knowing little pa^e follows close behind
the Queen and holds high the long trailing
ermine mantle. This is little Harry Offer-
maun, quite conscious indeed of the
mighty honors bestowed upon him in
holding the train of so gracious and so ab
solute a monarch. The sentinel. Arthur
McDonald, and his two pages, Howard
and Edward Hurlbut, lead the way to the
throne. The maids of honor are robed all
in white silk ornamented with red roses.
No Queen of ancient times was ever at
tended by maids so beautiful.
Now the Queen has reached the canopy,
My Lord Gilchrist hands her to the throne
wiih all the courtliness that even Queen
Elizabeth could exact. Another instant
and two maids of honor have placed the
crown upon Queen Lillian â and San Mateo
County has its tirst monarch. Now, James
B. o'K.eefe.for the time being Mayor of
the city, brings forward the big silver keys.
He bends the knee before the crown and
then he says:
"Your Gracious Majesty, the distinction
of being the city of your coronation and
ascension to the throne of San Mateo
County Carnival of Flowers is an honor
of which the citizens of Redwood are not
unmindful. They enter into the spirit of
this .happy occasion and rejoice with you.
The city's oificial representatives have
delegated to me tne authority and ac
corded the pleasure of presenting these
silver keys to the Queen of the carnival,
thus symbolizing that she surrenders her
sovereignty unto you. Yourself and guests
are to enjoy the freedom of the city and
the warm friendship of her citizens. We
express the hope tnat yours will be a
reign of pleasure in whicn your guests to
the city will share. We extend you a
hearty welcome."
t When this is said and the keys really
passed then My Lord Prime Minister Gil
christ, on behalf of her Majesty, thus re
sponds:
"On behalf of her Majesty I take pleas
ure in accepting the symbol of authority
which the citizens of this city have so
kindly presented. She wishes to express
the hope that she may be guided by the
spirit which leads to the happiness of her
guests."
And so the Queen is crowned, and the
festival of Dame Flora is begun. Her
Majesty and her Minister step down. They
are met by Mr. Bullockâ a Prince or Duke
is he, and he bears in his arms a pretty
blossom from each town and city in the
county, and on his toneue soft words of
greeting and allegiance. All of these he
bestows upon Queen Lillian and the Lord
Chamberlain makes another pretty speech
in acceptance. Now, verily, all of San
Mateo County has sworn fealty to the
reign of pleasure, and there must be no
troubled brows till the reign is over.
Again the orchestra plays the grand
march. The garlar.ds, which marked off
the royal promenade are laid aside and
the dance begins. It is the grandest fete
that San Mateo County has ever seen, the
most pleasing spectacle that any one well
could find. The coronation ceremonies
are over now. They were a success from
first to last, The coronation ball is still in
progress. The spacious hall is crowded
with dancers, and as many spectators as
the galleries will hold are watching the
beautiful moving color picture below with
the keenest in terest. More than 600 people
are in the hall, and there are still others
who would get in if there was room.
It is the elite orchestra of Redwood City
that is now keeping time in soft strains
to the twinkling feet, and its members
are: George Long, leader and first violin;
Harry Jamieson. clarionette; Will Jarnie^
son. trap drums; Lottie Christ, second
violin; Will Lipp, piano; Gus Staller,
slide trombone; Marie Heiner, second
violin; Carl Plump, bass violin; May
Cook, first violin; Charles Dohrmanstein,
piccolo; Henry Petzold, cornet.
During the coronation ceremonies the
Redwood City quartet added not a little
to the success of the great event by their
singing. In the quartet are Miss Lulu
Winne, John Lewis, Miss May Winneand
Cliff Bacon.
Of course all the ladies of the Free Kin
dergarten Association, for whose benefit is
the entire festival, were present, as were
also the schoolteachers now attending the
institute at the grammar school in this
city.
At the close of the afternoon session of
the institute all its members were the
guests of Philip Princevalle, the popular
candy manufacturer and proprietor of the
Redwood City Palace of Sweets. Here
some sixty odd ladies and gentlemen were
entertained with icecream and refresh
ments of the milder kindâ right royally
entertained, say all those who were par
takers of Mr. Friuceval'e's hospitalities.

MAYOR SUTRO'S BIRTHDAY
Remembered by Four Singing
Verein's in a Pleasant
Way.
His Honor's Sixty-Sixth Anniversary
Celebrated With Song and
Good Cheer.
The flower-perfumed walks of Sutro
Heights were invaded last night by 100
visitors from tne singing societies of the
four German Vereins, who invaded the
quiet Dome of the Mayor.
The cause of this invasion of the Heights
was the sixty-sixth birthday anniversary
of the City's chief executive.
The fact that the Mayor had not left the
City became known to a few of his im
mediate friends, among whom was Theo
dore Wiesr, an active member of one of the
vereins. Through Wiesr and a few others
a surprise was planned for the Mayor and
it was well carried out.
At 9 o'clock last evening the following
singing societies, under the leadership of
Professor A. isanz, assembled In front of
the entrance to the Heights: Alpen
roesli, Hessen, Schwaben ana Walholia.
They were marshaled by Mr. Wiesr
and headed by "Baby" Schmidt of the
Heights, who weighs 350 pounds, marched
through the grounds to the residence of
the Mayor.
On arriving at the residence the follow
ing songs were sung: "Der Tag dcs
Herrn," "Ym Lager yon Accon," "Macht
dcs Gesanges," "Haute Scheid Ich."
At the conclusion the Mayor stepped
out on the veranda, where he was met by
Herman L. Schmidt, who congratulated
him on his sixty-sixth anniversary.
His Honor responded, thanking his Ger
man friends for their thouphtfulness in
remembering him, and be invited them
into the banquet hall, where a supper had
already been prepared by the members of
his family, who were spending the even
ing with him. An elegant floral piece,
with the monogram "A. S." and 1830 and
1896, beautifully worked in pansies and
daisies, was presented.
A jovial and happy evening was spent
by friends and visitors until the last car
at midnight carried the singers to their
homes.
Smoking was not permitted in railway
carriages until 1846. On many foreign
lines smoking is so general that carriages
are Bet apart for non-smokers and so
abeled.
SINGLE TAXERS
"LOAD FOR BEAR,"
A National Petition Signed
by 10,000 Califor
nians.
PLEDGE FOR CANDIDATES
They Will Be Required to Sup
port a Constitutional
Amendment.
FARMERS NOT IN OPPOSITION.
Joseph Leggett and James S. Reynolds
Speak on Single Tax Issues in
California.
Now that the theory of the single tax
has become an issue of importance in
local, State and National politics through
the earnest and long-continued labor of
such men as Henry George and Congress
man James G. Maguire, the National Sin
gle Tax League has been circulating in
every State in the Union a petition pray
ing that the several Legislatures will en
act such measures as will result in the col
lection of all public revenues from the
value of land without regard to improve
ments on it and from no other source.
The petition is issued by the National
committee of the Single Tax League aud
reads as follows :
To the Legislature : We, the undersigned,
hereby petition for the enactment of such
measures as may result in the collection of all
public revenuesâ State, county, township and
municipalâ from the value of land, irrespec
tive of improvements in or on it, and for the
abolition of all other taxes now levted for this
purpose.
Name
Residence
City or town
County and State
On the reverse side of the petition is the
following argumentative language in re
gard to the utility and necessity of the
single tax :
THE SINGLE TAX.
The single tax means the abolition of all
taxes on industry or on its products and the
taking for public purposes, by the taxation of
land values irrespective of improvements, of
that fund arising from the general growth
and development which constitutes the natu
ral, just and sufficient source of public reve
nues.
To tax labor or its products is to discourage
industry and decrease the general wealth.
To tax land values is to discourage the great
est of monopolies which prevent industry and
lessen the general wealth.
It will render it impossible for any one to ex
act for his private benefit a toll from others for
the use of those bounties of nature to which all
have the equal right of use, and compel every
one holding valuable natural opportunities
either to utilize them by the employment of
labor or permit others to do so.
It will thus open opportunities of work for
all and will secure to each the full reward of
his work. As a result involuntary poverty will
cease; the creed, intemperance and vice that
spring from poverty, or the dread of poverty,
â will disappear, and a reasonable equality of
condition, born of the equality of access to
natural opportunities, wIU t&ko the place of an
increasingly monstrous inequality.
The circulation of the petition for Cali
fornia has been in charge of Attorney James
S. Reynolds. When seen yesterday at his
offices, 405 Montgomery street, Attorney
Reynolds stated the interest manifested by
Californians generally relative to the
single tax doctrine had exceeded his great
est expectations. He said:
"The petition has been circulated in
every county in the State, though in some
more industriously than in others. San
Francisco leads, with over 2000 signatures.
Tulare comes next, with over 1000. Others,
liKe Alameda, Fresno, Kern, Kings, Los
Angeles, Sacramento, Stanislaus, Sonoma,
Marin and Plumas, follow with from 200
to 400 each. The sum total is nearly 10,000
signatures.
"In some localities a majority of the
voting population have signed. Not all
of these can be counted as active single
taxers, yet they all knew what they signed
and most of them knew what they wanted,
and can be relied on to vote for the single
tax the first time it is presented to them
as a measure in practical politics.
"It is our purpose to circulate this peti
tion moie actively than ever before
until the Legislature meets. It is
a mistake to suppose that the farmers of
California are either indifferent or gen
erally opposed to the doctrine of the single
tax. This is shown by the large number
of signatures in several of the valley
counties. W. H. Alford, Esq.. of Visalia.
who was a member of the Assembly of
1893, and at that time strenously opposed
to the submission of a single-tax constitu
tional amendment, has since become a
convert to the doctrine, and told me over a
year ago that they can carry Tulare County
the first time they get a chance to vote
on it.
"Plumas County is also regarded as per
fectly safe, owing to the work of James E.
Mills and others.
"Circulating this petition is not all the
single-taxers are doing now by any means
âthey are 'loading for bear.' A demand
begins to come in from those who have
signed the foregoing petition for some
thing more definite. They propose to re
quire a pledge from legislative candidates
to submit a constitutional amendment
that will open the way to single-tax legis
lation.
"In compliance with this request, the
following pledge has been prepared and
will immediately be put into circulation :
I hereby promise that I will vote only for
such candidates for the Senate and Assembly
as are pledged in writing to submit a constitu
tional amendment which will open the way to
single-tax legislation.
"This pledge will be vigorously circu
lated from now on up to the time of the
election. Single-taxers are beginning to
think that they have been doing educa
tional and propaganda work long enough
to look for practical results. This pledge
will put Legislative candidates to the test.
In very many districts in the State they
hold the balance of power, and in this
matter they absolutely know no politics
except such as make for or against the
amendment.
"All we. need in this State to make a be
ginning in adopting the single tax is to
get the constitutional provision requiring
everything to be taxed to be amended so
that the Legislature will have jurisdiction
of the subject. Or, if we had local option
in taxation, we know for a certainty that
we could carry several counties immedi
ately for the abolition of all taxes on per
sonal property, and San Francisco is one
of them. This shows how important we
regard the question of the constitutional
amendment proposed."
Attorney Joseph Leggett, who is the
California member of the National Com
mittee of the Single-tax League, said:
"The single-tax is rapidly passing out of
the stage of mere propaganda and enter
ing the field of practical politics. It is in
active political discussion to-day in the
States of Delaware, New York, Massa
chusets, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois, and
it is destined soon to become the leading
issue in every State of this Union.
"That the people even in California are
ready for the issue is evident from the fact
that in little over a year nearly 10,000
voters here signed the National single-tax
petition, and these signatures have been
obtained solely through the voluntary and
desultory work of a few earnest men dur
ing their leisure hours."
EPISCOPALIAN CONVENTION.
Hundred Delegate* From Diocese of
California to Meet in Grace Church.
The forty-sixth annual convention of
the Episcopal Diocese of California will be
held in Grace Church, corner of California
and Stockton streets, next Tuesday,
Wednesday, and probably a large part of
Thursday.
About a hundred clerical and lay dele
gates are expected, and they will represent
the district from San Francesco Bay south
to Bakersrield.
No business of particular impoitance is
expected at this year's convention. The
settlement of financial questions between
the diocese and the recently created diocese
of Southern California will be one of the
pricipal matters for discussion. Then, too.
the canons of the diocese will have to be
altered to conform with the new territor
ial boundaries occasioned by the formation
of tbe southern see.
The Rev. E. J. Lion of St. Stephen's in
this City will Dreach a sermon at 11 o'clock:
on the opening day of the convention.
On Thursday evening the Right Rev.
Bishop Nichols will give a reception at the
Occidental Hotel from 8 until 11 o'clock.
While it will be primarily in honor of the
delegates it will be a large general recep
tion to all Epicopalians.
On the following Friday at 11 A. m.
Bishop Johnson of Los Angeles will make
his debut before a San Francisco audience,
when he will preach at the annual meet
ing of the Woman's Auxiliary to be held
in St. Luke's Church.
RARE FLOWERS ON SHOW
Exhibition of Beauties Will Open
in the Palace Hotel
To-Day.
Will Be Tod by Ladhs as They
View the Blossoms in the
Maple Hall.
In the annex of the Maple room in the
Palace Hotel there were a dozen vases of
old-fashioned roses yesterday, some yel
low, one cluster pink and still others of the
pale "tea" variety. And they had come
from Monterey to bloom beside the pam
pered beauties of the flower show. A trifle
quaint and plebianthey looked there amid
rare palms, waiting to be classed, and
though fragrant as roses are, yet their one
charm in the connoisseur's critical eye
was a pretty historical incident.
The roses were dried by the journey and
perhaps a little worn from long years in
the adobe soil.
They were reminiscent of- a romantic
happening long ago at Monterey. As the
story was told by a lady in the Maple
room yesterday it proved to be one of the
most interesting things said about the
show. They came from an old lady at
Monterey. When a beautiful girl she met
General Sherman, and they were lovers
for a time by the blue bay. One day while
the general was in the garden with his
fiancee â for they had pledged their troth â
he receivea a summons to no East. The
general promised he would return and
make her his bride, and they planted a
rosebush together where they stood.
General Sherman went away, but never
came back to Monterey. His love was left
with the roses that have bloomed and
grown old and are now interesting for their
story.
"She is selling the roses now, partly for
a living," was the careless remark of a lady
engaged in arranging the flowers.
The show promises to be a triumph of
floriculture, and apart from these blossoms
will attract attention from lovers of flowers.
It is the thirteenth flower show in San
Francisco, held by the >tate Floral Society,
that was organized seven years ago. While
the season was not favorable to the possi
bilities of a fine display of blossoms extra
efforts have been made by exhibitors to
secure some interestinc specimens, and for
that reason it is believea the show will be
even better than it would have been under
different circumstances.
Last evening as mauy as thirty-six ex
hibitors had made formal application for
space, and many more were expected to
apply to-day. San Francisco, Mann, San
Mateo, Alameda, Santa Clara, Mendocino,
Monterey, Santa Cruz and Contra Costra
counties were represented.
The show will open at noon to-day,
when a private reception to several promi
nent people for inspection will be held.
The Maple and Marble halls and the
Maple annex will then present a beautiful
spectacle, with the choicest and most
beautiful blooms of the local gardens set
out upon white stands in glass vases.
The rooms will be thrown open at 1 p. m.
and remain open until 10 p. m. continu
ously till Saturday, when the hours will be
from 10 a. m. to 5 p. m. and 7 to 10 p. m.
Promenade concerts will be given each
evening and the State University will have
men from its agricultural department each
afternoon to teach visitors how to treat
flowers. The rose display will be the chief
feature, but there will also be a splendid
East Portland, Or., boasts of one of the
prettiest Margarettes in the land. This
sweet little girl is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. H. Schnider of 282 Crosby street, East
Portland, Or. As you see her in this pic-
ture you see her in the flesh. Her cheeks
are plump, her eves bright, and there is
color in her cheeks. There is not a mark,
a blot or blemish to spoil the beautiful
contour of the face. The reason is given
that she has been using Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla. Margarette sends her love
to California, and tells of her delight with
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
Margarette is winsome, bright, and is
easily the prettiest Margarette in the coun-
try. I spoke to her father. His place of
business is at 33 Fourth street, Portland,
he came out of his office especially to tell
me of the great good Joy's Vegetable Sar-
saparilla had done forthefamily. "It is,"
said he, "the family medicine now, and
we propose always to keep this remedy in
the house." He advised me to visit many
other houses in Portland and I would
learn of wonderful things that had been
done by Joy's Vegetable fearsaparilla. He
said be knew of a case of scrofula that was
completely cured by this great blood med-
icine. He also informed me of a lady who
had running sores over the body and she
had been using the Sarsaparilla for two
months to good effect.
By the way, a remarkable thing in Port-
land is that there are no substitutes here.
People are not putting up something '-just
as Â«ood." and of course when you ask for
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla you get it
without a murmur. The truth is they are
not cutting the price, and druggists make
a rational profit, therefore do not feel in-
clined to cheat people. It is a good idea
to publish this letter as written.

CITIZENS MUST READ.
Judge Belcher's Fiat Regarding Appli
cants in Hi* Department.
Judge Belcher has decided that no man
who cannot read or write may pass him
as a citizen. A few days ago such an ap
plicant presented himself, and Judge
Belcher denied his application.
"I will not admit any one to citizenship
who cannot read," said the Judge in deny
ing the application, "for one of the most
important duties of citizenship is jury
duty, and the law contemplates that jurors
shall be able to read.
"It provides that when the jury retire
to consider their verdicr they may take
the exhibits with them and the written
instructions given by the court and their
own notes of the testimony. Every per
son whom I admit to citizensnip will have
to read to mo from the constitution of the
United States and, upon examination, dis
play acquaintance with its principles."

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
"Whatever the monopoly may do it can
noi stop the competing railroad.
By this time next year Cleveland can go
fishing without anybody making a fuss
about it.
The rival glories of Redwood and Santa
Rosa will set the State in a blaze for the
rest of the week.
It is the unpledged delegations that hold
the balance of power in all conventions
and name the winners.
The proposed free market is one of the
home enterprises that will benefit city and
country and do good all around.
From the way things are going the time
may come when Chicago will begin to call
herself the Stockton of the lakes.
The man who can best harmonize ail the
elements of the Republican party is the
man to be nominated at St. Louis.
It is one of the good signs of the time
that the free-traders have so far quit their
foolishness as to quit talking about it.
Many a Democrat who evades any talk
about the tariff has made up his mind to
himself to vote for protection next time.
The Redwood festival is to San Fran
cisco something like a home enterprise
and ought to be patronized on that basis.
Californians who say they do not care
whether the State has a representative in
the next Cabinet or not wouid say most
anything.
While Cleveland'? Venezuelan message
was good enough, the country would pre
fer a foreign policy that had vigor of action
as well as of talk.
Call it protection, reciprocity, bimet
allism or what you will, the main issue be
fore the American people this year is to
return to prosperity.
In saying that he has committed no out
rages in Cuba General Wevler has been
guilty of plagiarism. The Sultan said the
same thing about Armenia.
Since the Democrats of Massachusetts
have indorsed Russell for the Presidency
it is observed in Washington that Olney is
more like an icicle than ever.
Gorman would have roasted Cleveland
more effectually if he had not scattered
his fire in a foolish attempt to roast the
policy of naval extension also.
The Russell platform is said to be the
Bam e as the Cleveland platform, and if
that be true he is standing on a slippery
mud bank beside the McGinty sea.
All Eastern visitors to California should
make it a point to attend at least one of
the many festivals of the season to see the
beauty a California town can put on when
it decorates itself.
About 500 newly arrived pauper immi
grants are to be sent back where they
came from, but as they are only a small
fraction of those that got in Europe still
has the bulge on us.
California Republicans are loyal to all
the great leaders of the party, and it would
be a misrepresentation to send to tbe Bt.
Louis convention a delegation pledged to
any one to the exclusion of all others.
Carnegie may have told the truth in
saying that he made armor-plate only as a
patriotic duty, but it is certain that in
making out his -bills he attended strictly
to p rivate businessana made the most of it.
It is a significant sign of the times that
while Democrats are talking about the
chances of their various leaders as candi
dates Republicans are discussing which of
their leaders is best fitted to be President.
As the Boston Journal reports a notable
absence of the mugwump element from
the recent Democratic State Convention in
that city it is evident that the rats have
abandoned the sinking ship aud the end is
near.
To eliminate everything displeasing to
one faction or another in the party the
Democrats this year will have to make
their platform so narrow that the candi
date who goes through the campaign on
it will feel very much as if he had been
ridden on a rail.
A bill has been introduced into the Mas
sachusetts Legislature providing for the
tearing down of the present Capitol and
erection of a new one, and as a conse
quence tliere are more kinds of hysterics
among the conservatives of the State than
would be manifest in a woman's rights
convention if forty rats were turned loose
oa the floor.
Six Statesâ Massachusetts, New York,
Ohio, Minnesota, Montana and Utahâ are
considering the advisability of adopting
the Torrens system of land transfer, and
there ia reason to believe most of them
will adopt it in some form. The bill on
the subject introduced into the Ohio Legis
lature proposes to make the system com
pulsory, but elsewhere the sentiment is in
favor of trying it fix at as an optional ex
gwimeut.
OFF ITS PERCH.
Our contemporary, the Examiner, has
been taking of late a much greater interest
in Republican than in Democratic politics.
This, of course, is natural, for the affairs of
Democracy are calculated to produce a
tired feeling even in Democratic organs
and incline them to look to Republicanism
for something of political life and vigor.
Thus we are not surprised that the Exam
iner should have devoted a part of its
editorial page yesterday to a consideration
of "McKinley in California," nor do we
find it strange that the consideration
should have led it to undergo a spell of
morbidness and write out of its bile rather
than its intellect.
The Examiner declares "McKinley would
make the weakest candidate the Republi
can partycould put upâ always excepting,
of course, disreputables like Quay." It
further asserts: "The one weak spot in
McKinley's campaign is the East. If he
were as strong on the other side of the
Ohio as he is on this side he would get
the nomination by acclamation." This is
the Democratic view, it seems, and will
doubtless be as amusing to independents
and even to intelligent Democrats as it is
to Republicans.
It is a misuse of terms to speak of
McKinley as the "weakest candidate" the
Republican party could put up, for as a
matter of fact there are no weak candidates
named for the party nomination. Any
one of the illustrious Republicans who
have been proposed for the Presidency
would be elected if nominated. The mem
bers of ths party in California will vie
with those of other localities to see wnose
State will roll up the biggest majority for
protection prosperity and the St. Louis
nominee. Allison, Cullom, Reed, Morton.
McKinley. or Quay would each poll not
only the full vote of the Republican party,
but the independent vote and a consider
able percentage of Democrats and Popu
lists, who have repented of free trade and
Clevelandism.
The Examiner's attempted slur upon
Quay by the use of the word "disreput
able 1 ' deserves a passing notice. Quay is
disreputable only smong Democrats, who
vilify the leader who beats them, and
among a certain class of Pennsylvania
would-be bosses who have tried to over
throw him and failed. His war record is
one of the most glorious achieved by the
brave men who entered the army as
privates and won promotion by arduous
service on the field. His political record
shows him to be one of the ablest leaders
of men now living, and his achievements
in the Senate give him a right to rank
among the great statesmen of the age.
He is not disreputable among people of
good repute themselves, and the honors
bestowed on him by the conservative and
honorable commonwealth of Pennsylvania
is a proof of the fact.
The Examiner need not concern itself
further about the Republican party or Re
publican candidates. It may take it as an
assured fact that the party, with any of
the great men named as its leader, can
carry the country.
In the meantime it might be worth while
for our contemporary to look around and
see if it can nnd a Democratic candidate
who will be sure of carrying for his party
even so much as a State or two in the one
time solid South.
NEWSPAPERS AND TRADE.
The Call has repeatedly called atten
tion to the folly of those of its contem
poraries that seek to establish a larger
circulation by offering chromos, prizes and
a thousand forms of fake inducements to
the public. This course of building up or
maintaining a paper is journalism in name
only. A newspaper should sell news and
not books, bicycles or baby carriages. It
should aim to give its readers the value of
their money in the fullness of its reports
of trade, politics, society and all the
abounding activities of life. If it cannot
give news enough to justify the charge it
makes it should cease to call itself a news
paper and solicit subscriptions only for its
coupons and their chances.
The subject, however, has another as
pect tnat is too often overlooked. The
Dress stands in an almost confidential re
lation to business. Tbe newspaper and
the merchant are allies. They are of mu
tual helpfulness when each is conducted
in legitimate channels. When the news
paper, however, combines its press with a
junkshop and proceeds to issue coupons
by which people can get a cheap sort of
books, bicycles or baby carriages at prices
far below what good articles can be sold
for by men who have a reputation as hon
est merchants to maintain, then the press,
instead of being the ally, becomes the foe
of the merchant. Instead of building up
trade it tends to demoralize it, and not in
frequently seriously injures business by
introducing into a community an over
stock of cheap articles of one kind or an
oiher that prevents the sales of the mer
chant.
If a newspaper should undertake to in
troduce cheap labor into a community the
workingmen's unions would very soon
register an effectual protest. The mer-
cantile community, however, seems to
lack this ability to work together. Deal
ers in one branch of trade do not make a
common cause with those of another
branch whose business is assailed by some
new coupon scheme advanced by an "en
terprising editor." Thus the journalistic
faker is enabled to attack first one branch
of business and then another with com
parative impunity. So long as merchants
act with this indifference to a mutual in
terest they will always be exposed to the
faker's assaults, and the misfortune of one
branch of trade to-day is likely to be that
of another to-morrow.
The doctrine of The Call has been that
of "live and let live." Competition is hard
enough as it is upon merchants of small
means without having added to it the
tricks and schemes of fake journalism. The
coupon, lottery ticket, prize chromo busi
ness we regard, therefore, as being doubly
injurious, inasmuch as it not only degrades
journalism but demoralizes trade. It is
rapidly becoming one of the great evils of
journalistic and business life and it is
high time that reputable merchants as
well as reputable editors should begin to
take some steps toward abating it.
WORKING SOUTHWARD.
The hearty assistance which Fresno is
giving the right-of-way agent of the Valley
road in selecting a route south of Fresno
is all the more commendable when it is
reflected that the road to Fresno is assiired
and will soon be completed, and that the
city is thus provided with a means for
sending its products to tidewater. What
ever benefit it may secure from the south
ward extension of the road will be small
in comparison with its facilities for reacn
ing the bay of San Francisco. Not con
tent with all the financial and moral en
couragement which it has given the new
road, it sends able citizens into the field to
assist in securing a right of way. Such
public spirit as this is worthy of emula
tion. Doubtless Visalia, Hanford, Tulare
and BaKersfield will put similar com
mittees at work.
No contracts will be made for right of
way until all the routea have been in
THE SAN FRANCISOC CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 30, 1896.
spected and the terms offered by land
owners'are compared. As the territory is
all good and the choice of routes on that
account small, the selection will be de
termined by the liberality of the land
owners. The value of the road to all lands
over which it passes will be so great that a
serious injury will be suffered by progres
sive owners willing to donate the right of
way if others, who wish to take a selfish
and short-sighted advantage of the situa
tion, force the road upon some other route
by demanding damages. The great need
of that whole section for a competing road
is so evident that any obstacle to its rapid
progress would be a misfortune.
The operations of the new company
thus far nave developed some things that
are entirely new in the history of railroad
operations in California. Whenever ma
terials and labor procurable in California
were needed they have been employed.
Construction has been done honestly and
without tne mediation of a company or
eanized among the controlling stockhold
ers to make a profit out of the work. The
policy announced at the start, to charge
only such transportation rates as will pay
a reasonable interest on the investment is
being put in operation by the compilation
of schedules based on that proposition.
Nothing fictitious or shady has been re
sorted to. The result of such a policy
has been to secure a popular sympathy
and co-operation hitherto unknown in
California between railroads and the peo
ple. This will have a very important bear
ing on the value of the new company's se
curities and the amount of its earnings.
It will likewise react wholesomely upon
the work of developing the State.
DISTRESS OF MANUFACTURERS.
Their distress must be great when more
than a thousand leading manufacturers
feel obliged to commission a score of their
number to go to St. Louis and tell the
Republican Convention that speedy relief
from the hurtful operation of the Wilson
tariff act is necessary to the existence of
the industrial enterprises of this country.
Yet just such a committee was appointed
by a convention of manufacturers in Phila
aelphia the other day. They had given
the Democratic theory of import taxes a
thorough practical test, and they com
pared notes. The conclusion was that the
country must go back to substantially the
schedule of Custom-house charges of 1890
or the wages of industrial operatives would
have to be brought down on a parity with
the operatives of Europe. The alternative
remained, of course, to put out the fire in
their furnaces and let their enipioyes seek
a living in other channels of occupation.
No stronger or more logical argument
could be submitted for the cause of protec
tion than the statement, substantiated by
the figures of experience of more than a
thousand owners of American industrial
enterprises, that they cannot longer keep
the machinery of their plants in motion
unless the Nation stands between them
and the product of the pauper and poorly
paid labor of the old country, unless they
adopt Europe's wage schedule and reduce
American labor and American manhood
to the level of the industrial centers of the
countries of Euope. In view of these
facts it is not to be wondered at that the
industries of America are up in arms as
one man against the further operation of a
law that steadily but surely gives foreign
countries the privilege of becoming mas
ters in the markets of the United States
upon the ruins of our own industries.
The brain and the brawn of this country
are in perfect accord with the purpose of
this committee of manufacturers, and it
may be said that if the St. Louis conven
tion fails in any particular to emphasize
the determination of the Republican party
to right the great wrong which has been
inflicted upon the country by Democratic
incapacity the people will repudiate the
candidate. But, of course, the convention
will pledge the party to principles which,
contemplate the highest good to all the
people. The people of the United States
have been driven close to the abyss of
bankruptcy in the last three years, but
there are still lower depths to sink into,
and because there are, and it is because the
people want the country's business inter
ests carried away from and out of reach of
Democratic policies and Democratic igno
rance of the needs and requirements of the
country's business interests, that they are
standing with the manufacturers in their
efforts to thoroughly fortify this country
against invasion by foreign pauper labor
made commodities. The time has come
when it must be made a settled and unal
terable principle of this Government that
the population of the United States shall
never be denied opportunity to earn
homes that employment may be secured
to the people of Europe or of Asia or of
Africa.
CANADIAN COMPETITION.
The recent realization of the harm which
the Canadian Pacific Railway is doing to
American commerce recalls an able mi
nority report made a few years ago to the
convention of chambers of commerce of
the Pacific Coast held in this City. A
committee was appointed to consider "the
application of the interstate commerce
law to tne American carrying trade of the
Canadian Pacific Railway, or the abolition
of the bonding system for railway carriage
through foreign territory." A. S. Hallidie
of this City presented a minority report,
but it was not adopted, as popular senti
ment on the coast had not been sufficiently
edncated at that time and was auite dif
ferent from the sentiment to which riper
experience has given birth.
The recent agitation In Congress on this
subject embraces two propositionsâ a
withdrawal by the United States of the
bonding privilege enjoyed by the Canadian
Pacific in shipping American goods out of
the United States over the feeders of that
road to the main line, and the granting of
a mail subsidy to the Oceanic Steamship
Company to enable it to compete with the
heavily subsidized steamers of the Cana-
dian Pacific, to the end that we shall re
cover a part of the large Australian traffic
which we have lost through the superior
advantages enjoyed by the Canadian line.
Mr. Hallidie's statement of the situation
in his minority report was the clearest and
ablest ever made. After showing that the
Canadian Pacific was carrying passengers
and freight at rates below those of our
roads he said :
"Running from Montreal to Vancouver,
a distance of about 2900 miles, costing
$161,000,000, the Canadian Pacific has re
ceived from the Dominion Government
$105,000,000 in cash and equivalents and
$110,000,000 in guaranteed securities. Its
property is free from taxation. By the
terms of its charter it has the sole privi
lege to build or operate railroads west of
Ontario. Its land grant of 25,000,000 acres
is exempt from taxation, as much as is
unsold, for twenty years. An annual
mail contract of $500,000 has been granted
for a connecting line of steamers from its
western terminus to Japan and China,
and for the short road built through the
forests of Maine, by favor of the State; it
receives also from the Dominion of Canada
a subsidy of $180,000 per annum for twenty
years. It has secured the control of lines
in Maine, Michigan, Wisconsin and Min
nesota, and the United States Government
has granted a franchise for a bridge across
the Straits of St. Marie, and it now con
trols over 5000 miles of railroad."
Mr. Hallidie pointed out that if it were a
mere matter of competition there would be
no ground for complaint, "but the privi
leges granted by the States and the United
States are not reciprocated by the Domin
ion, * * * and are menacing to Ameri
can interests." Of course Canada would
have nothing to gain, but much to lose,
from agreeing by treaty to place its rail
roads and connecting steamship lines on
an equal footing with ours. Our only
remedy is to withdraw the privileges
which we extend to Canadian roads and
meet its steamship subsidies with appro
priations. That report, the contents of
which are merely hinted at here, is recom
mended to the attention of those who are
specially interesting themselves in the
subject.

DON'T LET THE WORLD KNOW
YOU'RE DOWN.
The world is wide, remember this,
.Nnr shrink from fate's deep furrowed fro wn ;
Woo fortune with your brightest smiles.
Don't let the world know when you're down.
It spoils your chance for future deeds
To frame your face with dull care's crown;
Brace up, and higher hold your bead,
Don't let the world know when you're down.
The world will bow In servile zest
To one who sways it with a frown;
Toss up your head, and flash your eye.
Don't let the world know when you're down.
If scandaVs lip would seek to stain
The name you hold as honor's crown,
By your own life, refute the lie,
Don't let the world know when you're down.
If bare your purse, your beart most sad,
Your life near crushed by sorrow's crown,
Then mask them well with jest and song,
Don't let the world know when you're down.

"Neckwear designs show a decided change
this year. The fabrics are principally satin
finished, and the designs are mostly dotted
effects.
"I begin to plan my clothes six months in
advance of the season. I import my own wool
ens from the samples six mouths ahead. My
haberdashery, shirts, collars, neckwear and
that sort of thing receive the same attention.
1 am now having some new scarfs made from
my own designs in Chicago. The material for
my shirts is chosen in advance.
"This season I have some moire effects in
pink and blue, some Dresden rose patterns on
blue grounds and some in black and blue hair

latest thing in Parisian shirt patterns soon, a
large maple leaf woven into the bosom of the
shirt. I have both straight link and turnover
cuffs. My collars are tall and flare just a trifle in
front. The high turn-down collar is' out of

round toes with plain caps, fancy tops to go

some months ago to get away from the pointed
toe."

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
L'Echo Musical publishes for the first time a
story which the late Benjamin Godard used to
tell about his experiences in composing one of
his most popular works: "I once happened to
be spending the summer at St. Valery. and a
druggist in the neighborhood, who was adver
tising a liqueur, made in a convent near by,
came to me and said, 'I should like to send my
customers a little present, put up with each
bottle, and I thought that a new work by you
would be very acceptable. Could you not
compose a piece of dance music, so easy that
any young girl could play it to her parents at
first sight?' 'Easily,* I answered. The price
wa3 agreed upon, and, my visitor having de
parted, I went to the piano and composed
on the first theme that came into my head, a
valse as simple and flowing as conld be. At
every moment I wanted to slip in variations,
but, remembering the druggist's injunctions, I
restrained myself, and finally succeeded in
producing something so commonplace that I
was ashamed to sign it.
"I sent the music to the druggist.
"The day following he wrote: 'A thousand
regrets that your valse is much too difficult for
my customers. My friend X , who is an
excellent musician, could make nothing of it.
Will you write me one much more simple? 1
"It was impossible. I had already descended
to the lowest depth of art; so I tore up the
letter and threw the valse into a box of old
papers, never expecting to use it. A short
time after, haviilg returned to Paris, I met the
music-publisher Durand. 'You have nothing
for me?' he said. 'Nothing unless you want a
little thing written for young girls.' He
wanted to see it, so I showed him the valse
destined to accompany the famous liqueur. 'It
is admirable,' cried he, 'superb, magnificent.'
Fifteen days after he published it, and it went
off like hot cakes. Very soon it was being
played in all the concerts. The piece was that
which bears the title. 'Godard's Second Valse.' "
Fanny Bloomfield Zeisler, the well-known
pianist, is to give several concerts in this City
early in the autumn. In a sense this young
woman is an American, for though she was
born in Bielltz, in Austria, in 1865, the mis
take was promptly rectified by the removal of
her parents to Chicago, where the future art
ist arrived before she had reached the age of
'i. When she had reached the piano age she

l'ianiste Who Will Play Here Next
Fall.
had lessons, and ever since that time she has
been an intense and patient worker. Essipofl
heard her when that unruly Russian genius
was playing in Chicago, and", recognizing the
child's talent, advised, as a dutiful wife should,
that she go at once to Vienna, to Leschetlzky.
So to the man who has since become famous as
Paderewski's master she went, and for five
years Fanny Bloomfield studied with him.
Her debut was made in Germany, and it is in
Germany that she made her greatest successes,
though her home is still in Chicago.
There seems to be a perfect epidemic in
Europe just at present for erecting monu
ments to distinguished musicians, both com
posers and artists. The solemn festival held
in Vienna in honor of the new monument to
Mozart ended on the 21st inst. The Emperor
Francis Joseph presided in person at the cere
monies, which commenced with the perform
ance of Mozart's "Bundeslied. " This was fol
lowed by an oration, pronounced by M. X.
Dumba, president of the committee, after
which the monument was unveiled, while a
chorus sang "O Isis and Osiris," from "The
Magic Flute."
In Paris a committee has been formed to
erect a monument to the celebrated singer
Mme. Carvalho. Among the members of the
committee are many celebrated lights of music
and literature, including Reyer, Massenet,
Saint-Saens, Victorien Sardou, Ludovic Hal
evy, etc.
Emma Eames has a srreat success in Cesar
Franck's posthumous opera "Ghiselle," which
was recently produced for the first time at
Monte Carlo. Eames had been studying the
role in Paris -with Arthur Coquard, one of
Franck's pupils, and although it was a very dif
ficult and trying one, it suited the American
prima donna, and gave her fine opportunities
for rendering the different phases of emotion.
Raoul Gunsbourg, the director of the opera,
djd wonders in the mounting of tbo piece.
Speaking about "Ghiselle" he said: "The
world does not realize how great a master
Franck was. In this work alone there is origi
nality such as would place its composer, If he
had written nothing else, in the vÂ«ry first;
rank. He has seized the dramatic spirit of the
text in a perfectly marvelous way."
One of the editors of the Parisian newspaper,
Le Temps, has been visiting the Conservatory
of Brussels with an eye to "copy." In writing
up his experiences for Le Temps this is what
he makes F. A. Gevaert, the director oi the
Conservatory, say about the independence of
the institution: "I have been a quarter of a
century at my post. Would you believe that
during that time neither king nor burgomas
ter, neither the court nor the municipality,
has ever once used influence to make me
take a single pupil. You cannot imagine such
a state of things in France, but here I am in
dependent of the administrationâ l am as free
as if I were at home. 1 am judged by results
and no restraint is imposed."
At Verviers. in a committee has
been formed to raise a monument to Vieux
temps. The promoters of the plan address
themselves to all those who have personal
souvenirs of the great violinist or whose ar
tistic predilictions lead them to admire his
works. Among those who have already sub
scribed are Marsick, Sarasate, Peter Benoit
and Bazzini. The committee has asked the
Allgemeine Musique-Zeitung to open a sub
scription for the monument, but there are
some Belgian papers that feel very much
slighted because no one has asked them to do
anything.
A monument is about to be erected at
Schwerin to Flotow, the composer of "Mar
tha." It is interesting to recall the works
written by this composer, nearly all of which,
with the exception of "Martha," have been
Jong ago consigned to oblivion. Flotow waa
the composer of the following operas: "Peter
and Catherine," "Rob Roy," "The Duchess of
Giiise," "The Shipwreck of the Medusa," "The
Forester," "The Slave of Camoens," "Martha,"
"Stradella," "The Grand Princess," "Rube
zahl," "Indra," "Albin," as well as a ballet,
incidental music to "The Winter's Tale," and
a number of trios, romances, songs, etc.
Plunket Green, besides being a singer of
great renown, is also well known for his wit.
At a recent concert at which he sang, through
a typographical error the programme an
nounced him as "Plunket Green, soprano."
Mr. Green took up tha programme, looked at
it ana said, "By Jove, I'll take this home to
show my English admirers the effect this
American climate has on a man's voice."
Johann Strauss' new opera, "Waldmeister,"
has been produced in Berlin with as much
success as it met with in Vienna on its tirst
production.
LET'S GO UNPLEDGED.
San Francisco Mission Mail.
California wants a Cabinet officer. That is,
so say leading Republicans of this City and
State. To' accomplish this result they propose
that the delegation to the National Republi
can Convention be sent uninstructed so the
delegates will be free to throw a solid vote to
any candidate who appears most likely to get
the nomination. By this method, it is claimed,
California will be most likely to get a Cabinet
officer. Now, this proposition is a good one.
Let the delegation go unpledged by all means.
But in order that there be a certainty that the
delegation will agree at the National Conven
tion, have the State Republican Convention
send a solid unpledged delegation of either
MeKinley, Morton, Allison or Reed men to St.
Louis, then an agreement upon any candidate
can be easily reached. It will not do at
Sacramento to divide the eighteen delegates
to St. Louis among men of different Presiden
tial preferment, because an agreement cannot
be afterward reached where so great a di
vergence of opinion prevails at the start. All
must be for one man, not, as heretofore, di
vided. Oil and water selected at Sacramento
will not be apt to mix at St Louis, so let us
start right to secure that Cabinet officerâ let's
go unpledged with a solid delegation for one
candidate. ______________^
THE DEMOCRATS ALSO.
Placer Herald.
An unpledged delegation, but ft harmonious
one, should be sent to the National Democratic
Convention at Chicago. The platform adopted
by the State Convention at Sacramento should
be the platform of the Democracy of Califor
nia, and the preferences of that convention
should be the preferences cf the Democracy of
California. If the State Convention declares
for silver, or expresses a preference for any
Presidential candidate, care should be taken
that the delegation be sufficiently harmonious
to carry out the convention's wishes by every
honorable and Democratic means, but doa't
pledge them to any one candidate.
WHAT IT MEANS.
Santa .Monica Outlook.
Do not send delegates away from home
whom you cannot trust. To pledge them It
simply saying that you have no confidence in
them.

A FORTUNE TO
SEE HIS CHILD
Offer Made by the Blind
Owner of Ravens
wood.
RECEPTION IN THE "DEN"
Chris Buckley Other Than He
Is Generally Known to
the State.
CHRIS JR. RULES HIS FATHER.
How the Resident of Livermore Dif.
fers Frcm the Politician of
San Francisco.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April '29. i
All the State is taking a daily increasing
interest in the reported doings of Chris
Buckley, the politician. Very few ever
give a thought to Cnris Buckley, the lord
of the manor at Ravenswood.
"I would give $100,000 to look for one
Ravenswood, Chris Buckley's Beautiful Residence Near Livermore, and Its Owner.
minute at my boy !" It was Chris Buck
ley, the lord of Ravenswood, who spoke,
and after he had uttered the words a tear
rolled from his sightless eyes.
Chris Buckley, the San Francisco poli
tician, is known to all Californiaus, and
his alleged machinations have been given
to the whole world through newspapers
who are opposed to his policy. But it was
not the Chris Buckley of the City Hall
who spoke. Forget for a moment that
Buckley ever knew a Supervisor or
a city official; forget that his name
was ever associated with any schemes
that came nnder the piercing eyes of
grand juries; remember that the man's
most powerful enemies to-day were for
merly his friends and supporters or were
supported through him, and that conse
quently their judgment of his doings may
be a little warped; remember that he was
but the center of a storm of indignation
that enveloped others as completely as he;
carry out these suggestions and invest the
blind father with a mantle of charity and
human sympathy, and then think for half
a moment of the awful significance of the
parent's heartrending desire as he said :
"I would give $100,000 just to look for one
minute at my boy."
The husband and parent at Ravenswood
is a very agreeable and interesting man to
meet. If visited in the forenoon, as he
was recently, he will invariably be found
walking in his garden, arm in arm with
his wife, for the owner of Ravenswood de
lights to walk among his trees and shrubs
to enjoy their perfume and to hear his
faithful partner tell of that which he can
not see.
To everybody but the Assessor, however,
the undisputed Lord of Ravenswood is
Chris Buckley Jr.â the child whom his
father has never seen. He it is to whom
the father referred when he made the re
mark already quoted.
Young Chris is the great source of com
fort and solace that compensates for the
terrible loss of pleasure that his father ex
periences by not being able to enjoy the
visible beauties of his luxurious home.
There is a "den" at Ravenswood. It is
a beautiful apartment that the fattier
owns, the boy controls, and that both
parents and the child enjoy. There is a
handsome library in it, and a well-stocked
sideboard. On the center-table are the
daily papers and the magazines. Under
neath the table and in various places usu
ally held sacred from such debasement
are drum-sticks, blocks, rubber lizards and
horses and picture-books. They belong to
Chris junior, and his childish disregard of
decorum does not disturb his fatherâ he
does not see it. He only knows that his
boy is happy and that he has been told he
is a pretty child, and like parents who can
see for themselves he firmly believes it.
For hours each day the father devotes
himself to his boy. He teaches him verses,
tells him little stories, listens attentively
to all the lively prattle and baby elocution,
and is at once his friend, father and in
structor.
The Buckleys live very quietly and un
ostentatiously in their Beautiful home.
Occasional entertainment of San Fran
cisco friends take place, and these are
always royal events. At Livermore Chris
Buckley is all but worshiped. He has
enlisted the pood will and friendship of
all of Livermore Valley's residents and
those with whom he has had dealings.
But then, Chris has not worried himself
aoout Alameda County politics and does
not register from here.
Mr. Buckley was asked how he came to
settle in Livermore Valley, so far away
Iroru the center of his political work.
"I expect it was through the hospitality
of my old friend, Assembly man Joseph
Black, now dead. Visiting him
often, I very soon discovered that
the air here refreshed me, and
that the climate the year around was
most delightful. I have traveled all over
this State, into every nook and corner of
it, and I say in all sincerity I never found
a climate that suits me so well as that
which I enjoy in this valley. We are
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 30, 1896.
handy to San Francisco, and the prospect
is brightening for more railroads in the
valley and better and quicker communica
tion with the bay. This will supply the
great need of our valley. Hundreds of
San Francisco's men of wealth and cul
ture will build their homes here then.
"I have lived here eleven years. It was
rather funny, the way I came to christen
this place Ravenswood. When the first
house was Hearing completion the builder
insisted that we should nave a christen
ing. I could not think of a name, so the
carpenter told me to think of the most
beautiful place I had ever seen. My mind
went back to my childhood days and I
thought of a charming bit of landscape on
Long Island. It was called Ravenswood,
and so a bottle of wine was broken and
my place had a name."
In addition to being a politician and the
head of a beautiful home, Chris Buckley is
also greatly interested in wine-growing.
He was asked about the future of the
wine industry of Livtrmore Valley and
replied: "The prospects are brightening.
Here we are free from phylloxera. The
vineyards of Napa and Sonoma are doomed.
The reputation und demand for California
wines, especially Livermore Valley wines,
is on the increase. With a diraishing sup
ply and a growing market there can be
but one result. Those who Will stay with
the business intelligently and faithfully
are sure to win. If my advice were sought
as to what vines to plant, I should say,
plant to quantity. There is absolutely no
profit in high-class wines. I have in my
cellar the choicest of aged wine?, that
have probably cost me $1 a gallon, for
which jobbers are offering me 20 cents. If
I must give it away, those people will
never get any of it. Do you know, these
jobbers are the curse of the business.
They are a worse nuisance than phyl
loxera."
"And as to politics?"
"Politics never enter here," replied Mr.
Buckley.
Then Chris Jr. rushed into the "den"
with a new flower that he had just found
and asked his father to tell him all about
it. The little child cannot yet understand
why his father always feels for his mother's
arm or why be asks her so much that
little Chris can see for himself.
Such is Chris Buckley of Ravenswoodâ
not of San Francisco or Sacramento.
Chris Buckley Jr., of Whom His Blind Father Said: "I would give 5100,000 just
to look for one minnte on my boy."
NEY'S WATERLOO.
Knill, a Descendant of the Famous
Marshal, Gets Mixed Vp in a
Barroom Fight.
Emil Ney, who claims he is a descendant
of the famous Marshal Ney, got mixed up
in a hot political argument with the bar
tender in a saloon at 529 Sacramento street
on Tuesday evening.
It ended in the landlord and bartender
throwing Ney out of the saloon. In doing
so Ney stumbled and sprained his left
ankle. He asked Policeman McGovern to
take him to the Receiving Hospital in the
patrol-wagon, but, instead, McGovern took
him to the California- street station and
booked him on the charge of "drunk."
Ney sent for a messenÂ«er-boy and gave
him a message to take to the hospital. Ho
wrote that his ar'ile was sprained,' and he
wanted the ambulance to cell for him.
Having no smaller change, he gave the boy
a 50-cent piece, expecting that he would
return with the change after delivering the
message. The boy neither delivered the
message nor returned with the change.
Yesterday morning, after Ney had been
taken to the City Prison, he complained
of the pain in his ankl*. and he was sent
to the hospital, where his injury was at
tended to. Later he was sent to the City
and County Hospital.
Ney gave the police a description of the
messenger-boy, who will be arrested lor
misdemeanor and embezzlement.
The Wrong Man Stabbed.
John Forsbery, a marine fireman living in
Alameda, happened to be on East street last
evening while two men were fighting outside
a saloon. One of the men ran into the saloon,
and the other, mistaking Forsbery for his an
tagonist, stabbed him in the abdomen with a
penknife. When he discovered his mistake
ne disappeared. Forsbery was taken to the
Receiving Hospital. The wound is not serious.
Retained the Money.
Barbara Lambrecht, 251 Third street, swore
out a warrant in Judge Low's court yesterday
for the arrest of Attorney George F. Hotter, on
the charge ot misdemeanor embeezlement.
Bhc alleges that on February 12 she gave
Hotter $20 to institute a suit in the Justice's
Court, but he had not done bo and refused to
return the money.

The new six-lap board track being con
structed in Central Park was completed

pumice to prevent its being slippery. It
will be ready for use to-morrow, and
thereafter the wheelmen of San Francisco
will have one of the fastest and safest
tracks in the City to train and race upon.
Those who have seen it pronounce it per
fect in every respect, and the banking of
the curves wili make high speed quite pos
sible and perfectly safe.
The Camera Ciub Cyclists will journey
to Hay wards next Sunday, where they
will be the guests of E. G. Zeille. Those
who take their wheels will po on the
8:30 a. m. boat, and those who may be so

proiessionulâ Cash $7;j, cash $35, cash $15.
The entries close with the secretary of
the club, George W. Pollard, next Satur
day evening, and must be in his hands by
that time. From indications this will be
one of the best meets ever held on the
coast, as the prize list will induce the best
men to ride, and there are many of them
here now.
The Sterns racing team will arrive here
from Coronado to-day. Among the crack
riders on the team are Earl H. Kiser, Eli
Winsett, William Randall and F. E. Schef
ski, Eastern men, and W. W. Hatton and
W. J. Edwards of this State. They have
been south all winter trying for records,
and have been quite successful.
The team has come here to join the Na
tional racing circuit, which will begin to
morrow at the Fabiola Floral Fete, Oak
land, the other dates in California being:
Santa Rosa, May 2; San Jose, May 9; Ban
Francisco, May 16; Santa Monica, May 23.
R. M. Welch of the National racing
board will act as referee at the Fabiola
meet to-morrow. Sanfoni Plumuier, cap
tain of the Bay City Wheelmen, will
serve in the same capacity at Santa Rosa
to-day, to-morrow and Saturday.
The directors of the Olympic Club met
last evening and made final arrangements
for the boxing carnival, which will be held
at the Pavilion on Friday evening. Twenty
five hundred tickets have been sold al
ready, and the club expects t- a full house"
when the first bout will be called.
There seems to be some difficulty in se
lecting a referee. Hiram Cook and Al
King were suggested, but George Green
objected to one of the men and Ziegler did
not fancy the other.
A member who keeps well informed on
all matters that pertain to boxing, said
that the man who, in all probability, will
be selected to pass judgment on the box
ers is George Maxwell of the Olympic Club.
Maxwell is thoroughly conversant with
the game, and as he has had considerable
experience he should give general satis
faction.
Jack Bourdeti will hold the watch for
Ziegler and Jack Walsh may be selected
by Green as his timer. Tbe boxing com
mittee will announce to-day the names of
the men who will act as timers for the
club.
The combination mentioned in The
Call of last Saturday is being played
strongly at 5 to 1. T^ie combination is
Green, Hawkins, Van Buskirk and Sul
livan.
The odds ore 10 to 8 that Green will de
feat Zeigler. The first bout of the even
ing will be called at 8 :30 o'clock sharp.
The following tug-of-war team has been
selected by Professor George Miehline of
the Olympic Club for the tug-of-war con
test at Central Park on Saturday next,
viz.: Jackson, McDaniels, Mahoney,
Buckley, Schmidt and Butler.
LEGALLY SEPARATED.
The Martial Troubles of Mr. and Sirs.
Marks Ended and Lieutenant
Kiish Exonerated.
Some weeks ago there was a sensation
in society and navy circles when John L.
Marks instituted a suit for divorce against
his wife on the ground of infidelity and
named Lieutenant John B. Blish, U. S.
N., now stationed at Panama, as co-re
spondent.
Mrs. Marks strenuously denied the alle
gation, and threatened to bring a counter
suit for divorce from her husband on
various grounds.
Marks discovered afterward that the
evidence upon which he relied to sub
stantiate his charges was untrustworthy,
and Judge Slack denied the petition for
divorce.
The troubles between husband and wife
have now been settled ouc of court. A legal
separation upon the demand of Mrs.
Marks was effected. She was given the
custody of her little boy and granted a
suitable allowance.

M. Achille Kivarde.
"Slavonic Dance" Dvorak
Orchestra.
Monday evening Morrison's famous
company in a grand spectacular presenta
tion of Goethe's "Faust" will be the
Columbia's attraction. The piece is said
to be a magnificent production. On Sun
day afternoon Congreve's famous comedy,
"Love for Love," will be given by a com
pany of amateurs composed of students of
the State University.
"Bluebeard" still reigns in grimly comic
fashion at the Tivo'i, and no one as yet
seems tired of his sway. To-night a testi
monial benefit will be tendered the fa
vorite comedian, Thomas C. Leary, at
which the Elks will be present. A special
feature of the performance will be a
friendly set-to between Joe Choynski and
Eddie Greany, while favorite actors from
the other theaters will appear. The sale
oi seats has been very large.
Last night's production of "The Story of
Rodion the Student" at the Baldwin was
meritorious in most respects and some
passages were warmly applauded. To
night "Beau Brummell 1 ' will be given, and
since it is said to be one of Richard Mans
field's best the sale of seats has been good.
Miss Beatrice Cameron and Miss Florence
Ethel do their work well; but one or two
other members of the cast could easily be
dispensed with.
Mrs. Auzerais Hoyte continues to bask
in the sunshine of favor at the Alcazar.
Her methods in "My Son-in-law," while
leaving room for improvement, are by no
means lacking in fine touche?. The
Grovers and Mr. Foster, with Miss Aubrey,
form a capable support for Mrs. Hoyt, and
the general result is pleasing.
The Orpheum's "Midgets" are a draw
ing card, their wonderful evolutions call
ing forth bursts of applause nightly. Ed
ward and Josie Evans in their comic spe
cialties are very good, as is also Fulgora,
the transfigurator, whose illusions are
most tnystifyina:. The other numbers on
the bill are up to the usual standard.
"Lady Lil" holds court at the Grand
Opera-bouse, where Miss Lisle Leigh
make 3 a gem of the strange part. The
acting throughout is natural and some
what smoother than on the opening night,
while the stage settings and scenic effects
are specially appropriate and tastefully de
signed.
The horse show at the Auditorium is a
great all-round success, but the little Mexi
can mule is the star of the combination.
His antics are indescribable. The evolu
tions of the other members of tue eauine
cast are graceful and intricate, displaying
the most careful drilling on the part of the
trainers and the existence of a quality near
akin to intelligence in the horses them
selves.
"WHARF RATS" IN COURT.
Judge Low Holds Them to Answer
Before the Miperior Court.
Frank Marshall, Willie Latimore, Dan
iel McEvoy and Charles Bond, the four
"wharf rats" arrested for robbing John
Lundquist, a ship's carpenter, of his
watch and chain Sunday morning, ap
peared in Judge Low's court yesterday
morning.
Lundquist, Policeman Dwyer and Louis
Uphouse, another of the gang who turned
State's evidence, gave their testimony and
the Judge held the four boys to answer
before the Superior Court in $2000 bonds
each on the charge of grand larceny.
They did not seem to care very much
what became of them and looked upon the
proceedings as a joke. Marshall was the
only one who felt that he had got into a
bad scrape, and_ his looks at Uphouse
while he was giving his evidence were far
from pleasant.
SNATCHED A PURSE.
Ellis Howard Arrested on Suspicion of
Being; a Pickpocket.
Ellis Howard was arrested on Tuesday
night by Special Officer George Delmas in
front of the Grand Opera-house and is
lodged in the "tanks" at the City Prison.
Mrs. Mary Burch, who lives near the
Five-mile House, had been at the theater
and was boarding a Mission-street car
when her purse was snatched from her
hand. She quickly turned and saw three
men beside her. She called for help and
Delmas caught Howard. The other two
men ran and escaped, but the police think
they know who they are. The purse was
picked up from, the ground where it had
been dropped.
Mrs. Burch called at the City Prison
yesterday morning and identified Howard.

HOME-COMING OF
OFFICER WEBSTER
Troubles of the Concord's
Purser, Now Due
Here.
TO BE COURT-MARTIALED
Will Be Charged With Taking
an Illegal Bond Frcm
His Clerk.
THE DEPARTMENT AROUSED.
A Sensation Premised in Naval Cir
cles, and of Peculiar Interest
in Valhjo.
The United States steamer Concord from
the China station, which left Honolulu
for San Francisco a few days ago. is bring
ing home an officer whose reception at
>lare Island will be anything but pleas-
Ii i? Parsed Assistant Paymaster Edwin
15. Webster of the ship, and he will be called
upon to answer befc.e a court-martial to
charges unbecoming an officer in the na
val service. In 1894, while at the nuvy
yard, attached to the steamer Yorktown,
ne met Wiliiam H. Tobin, a clerk in the
employ of the Government. The young
man wanted to see the world and Web
ster offered him the billet of pay clerk on
the Yorktown. But there was a condi
tion to the position, Webster , informed
him, to the effect that pay clerks had to
put up a cash bond of $2500. He ex
plained that as clerk of the Yonctown he
would handle $50,000 or $7f>,000 a month
and the paymaster must have a cash se
curity in his safe from his clerk to cover
any future errors or indiscretions on the
part of the young man.
Tobin had never heard of this practice
and demurred, but Webster insisted that
it was a new order from the department.
Tobin had no money and the paymaster
went to the clerk's mother. She reluct
antly furnished the $2500 and Tobin sailed
for China in the Yorktown.
He became sick in Yokohama and was |
discharged at his own request by order of |
the Secretary of the Navy. He was with- j
out money to pay his fare home on the I
mail steamer and begged Webster to re- j
turn the cash bond. The paymaster told
him that he did not have the money and
Tohin had to send to his mother in Yal
leio for tlie price of Ins steamer ticket.
Mrs. Tobin died last January and in her j
Will E. McGettigan and Mathew Me- ;
EDWIN B. WEBSTER.
Manna were named as executors of the
estate. Among her papers was the re
ceipt from Webster, acknowledging the
payment to him of the $2500 as a bond.
.McGettigan tried to get a settlement from
the Yorktown's paymaster, and failing,
â¢wrote to Acting Secretary MeAdoo, with
whom be was personalty acquainted. That
otticial immediately communicated with
Webster, who stated in reply that he sim
ply borrowed the money from the Tobins
and that that sum was in nowise a secur
ity for the clerk's behavior.
McGettigan went to Washington and
called upon Secretary Herbert, to whom
he stated the case. T/he Secretary was in
dignant that an officer in the service
should take upon himself to extract a cas'i
bond from a clerk, and began measures to
have Paymaster Webster brought home to
e.\) lain this unusual transaction. As the
Concord was to be ordered to Mare Island
Webster was sent to that vessel, changing
places with Passed Assistant Paymaster
Leeds C. Kerr. The Concord, in com
pany with the Petrel, will probably arrive
in this port from Honolulu next Friday,
and will go directly to the navy-yara.
Mr. McGettigan was interviewed by a
Call reporter at the Russ House last even
ing and unhesitatingly made the forego
inir statement givinsr'in detail his meeting
with the Secretary of the Navy.
"Wuen I laid before him Web
sters receipt |Mven to Mrs. Tobin
for her sons cash bond," said Mr.
McGettigan, "Secretary Herbert was
a wry angry man. He also .-aw Webster's
letter to McAdoo and the explanation that
the money was only received as a loan, and
that statement didn't help the paymaster
in the estimation of his chief. '
"1 also informed Mr. Herbert that young
Tobin had tried in vain to get some kind
of a settlement out of \Vebst?r. but that
officer always answered that he had no
money. H^ pay :ss2ooo a year. He has
been in several difficulties before and was
court-martialed out in China about a year
ag-i. Paymaster Webster is a very speedy
officer according to ail accounts. His tale
to poor old Mrs. Tobin was a falsehood.
"A pay clerk in the naval service han
dies no money and has no responsibility
in that line, A paymaster is under heavy
bonds, but no bond is ever required of the
clerk. If such were not the case you may
know that the careful department would
soon clap a bond on him. On vessels of
the third rate, such as the Yorktown, Con
cord, Bennington, Adams, Ranger, etc.,
the ray clerk gets $1000 a year and is not
an officer, but is employed by the depart
ment on the recommendation of the pay
master.
"However, Mr. Webster took his clerk's
$2500 under peculiar circumstances, and he
is coming home to be investigated, as Sec
retary Herbert informed me should be
done. While he is undergoing the court
martial Mr. McManus and myself, as ex
ecutors of the late Mrs. Tobin's estate, will
begin suit against Paymaster Webster's
bondsmen for the return of $2500.
"i have been told that he was in a hole
and the money came to him in the nick of
time. He certainly used it pretty quickly,
for he was hard-up when Tobin asked him
for it a few months later in Japan. If the
young fellow had not received his fare
from Jiis mother, he would have been on
the beach in Yokohama yet."
In an interview with Administrator Mc-
Manus and also with \Y. J. Tobin, it is
learned that Edward McGettigan, the
other administrator of the estate of Cath
erine Tobin, deceased, while at Washing
ton a short time since in the interests of
the River and Harbor Commissioners,
called upon Secretary of the Navy Her
bert and had a personal interview with
him in regard to Paymaster Edwin B.
Webster. U. b l . N.
Mr. McGettigan was informed by the
Secretary that the claim of the adminis
trators was a just one and that the pay
master had no rich t to exact the money
of Mrs. Tobin, and he would be compelled
to refund the same. He asked to have an
acknowledged statement sent him by Mr.
Tobin concerning the full transaction.
This statement wus recently forwarded to
the Secretary, giving in detail the entire
proceedings and also a copy of the receipt
signed by Paymaster Webster.
An immediate reply to this statement
was received by Mr. McGettigan, who in
the meantime had returned from Wash
ington. The purport of the reply from the
Secretary was to the effect that he had or
dered Paymaster Webster's transfer from
the YorKtown to the Concord, which shin
was under orders to proceed from the
Asiatic station to Mare Island. This order
virtually meant that the Secretary did not
desire to incur any additional expense in
sending the paymaster home by mail
steamer.
It is known that the commandant at
Mure Island has received orders from the
department to carry out the instructions
of the Secretary, which are sufficently
stated there, as embodied m the letter to
Administrator McGettigan." He (Webster)
shall, upon his return home, make imme
diate payment of the $2,500 obtained from
Mrs. Tohin on a false statement of facts,
and in default of said payment the Secre
tary will proceed against' Webster's bond
men for return of the full amount." The
Secretary says, further, that in case it
should be necessary for Mr. Tobin to go to
Washington to consult with him regarding
the illegal transaction that Paymaster
Webster shall be compelled to pay all ex
penses incurred by his trip to the East.
It is not known what action will be taken
by the commandant on arrival of the
Concord, but it is hinted the paymaster
may be sent directly to Washington for a
personal interview with the department,
it is evident the Secretary intends having
the money refunded without delay, and
also that he will not condone any act tend
ing to bring disgrace on the pay corps. It
is also understood the paymaster is in ill
repute in the Paymaster-General's office
for sending statements falsely. Tobin
says the paymaster informed him the
money was obtained for the purpose of
squaring funds which he was short when
the Yorktown left here for the Asiatic
station.
ALTERING TRANSFERS.
Robert Bell Arrested on Complaint of
the Market - Street Cable
Company.
Robert Bell, an elderly man, was ar
rested at hia residence on Pierce street,
near Page, yesterday afternoon on two
warrants charging him with "restoring a
canceled check of a railroad company."
The complaining witness is Conductor
McCoy of the Market-street Cable Com
pany. It is alleged that Bell altered the
date on transfer tickets, plugged up the
punch hole, repunched the ticket .and
used it to travel on the company's lines.
When searched several transfers were
found in his pockets. He denied the ac
cusation and said that one of his sons was
making a collection of transfer tickets as
a "fad," and he gave him all he could
collect.
Bell was formerly steward at the City
and County Hospital. One of his sons is
in she Street Department and another is
in the Assessor's Office.
The arrest is said to be the first of a
series, as the company has the names of
several others who are accused of a simi
lar offense.
ILLEGAL FISHING.
An Unlicensed Fisherman Arrested and
a Four Hundred Fathom Set
Net Seized.
M. Nordman of Benicia was arrested
Tuesday by Deputy Fish Commissioner J.
H. Davis for tishing without a license.
Mr. Davis also picked up in Honkers Bay
a set net tneaburing 400 fathoms anchored
at one end by an anchor, and at the other
by weights of railroad iron. The net was
turned over to the local authorities and a
complaint entered against John Doe.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 30, 1896.
The Handsome Four-Masted Schooner Muriel That Made the Run From Hawaii in Fifteen Days. She
Was Built at Oakland and Is One of the Prettiest Schooners in the Bay.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The New Schooner Muriel Made
the Run From Hawaii in
Fifteen Days.
A VERY HANDSOME VESSEL.
Funds for the Relief of the Men
Drowned in the Blairmore
Pouring In.
One of the prettiest schooners in the bay
is the Muriel, which arrived here from
Honoipu, Hawaiian Islands, on the 26th
inst. She is loaded with sugar and this is
her maiden voyage. During her run to
Hawaii she made excellent time and the
owners are justly proud of the new vessel.
The Muriel will load general merchandise
for the islands, and a full cargo has already
been assured her.
Tho Italian ship E. Raegio and the I
British ship Promise Hill were in collision !
yesterday. The latter had her outer bob
stay carried away ana the end of her jib
boom broken off. The Raggio had her
jigger rigging carried away and her poop
rail damaged. The vessels were separated
without any trouble and a few hundred
dollars will repair all the damage. About
4:30 o'clock in the morning a strone
breeze from the Boutheast blew, and when
the tide caught the vessels the Primrose
Hill went adrift. The crew on the Raggio
were on the lookout, however, and serious '
damage was averted.
John Martel, who has for twenty years
been assistant chief clerk on the Pacific
Mail Company's dock, died last Tuesday
after a short illness. He was about 40
years of age and was one of the best-known
men on the water front.
The Harbor Commissioners are more
than pleased with the working of the new
purchasing depot. During the last six
raontnK about $4300 I as been saved to the
State. Superintendent S. E. Westlake
thinks that v still greater saving can be!
made. "It means a saving of over $700 a \
month," said President Colnon yesterday,
"and that is only the beginning of civil
service reform. As soon as we pet under
way you will see expenses drop like lead,
ami while 1 and my brother Harbor Com
missioners may be called every name in
the calendar, still the State will be tens of
thousands of dollars in pocket by the
transaction."
The amount of money raised for the
relatives of the men drowned in the Blair
more has reached the respectable sura of
f 1&0S 25. The lists are now closed, but a
lew dollars may be expected from the
Union Iron Works on May 7 (pay day).

The question of raisins the vessel is still
in abeyance, and Captain Burnt does not
know whether to raise her himself or sell
the hull as it lies. The chances are, how
ever, that work on her will begin next
week. As the vessel has settled into the
mud the work of raising her will be diffi
cult.
TO BESTRAIN PEDDLERS.
Ketail Fruit-Dealera Object to Their
Kinging Doorbells.
At a meeting of the retail fruit and
game dealers Monday niuht it was de
cided to append to the petition already
drafted for presentation to the Board of
Supervisors, asking that peddlers be pro
hibited from taking stands with their
wagons, but be compelled to keep moving
about the City; a request also to prohibit
peddlers from rineing doorbells in selling
their wares. Both privileges now prac
ticed by peddlers are claimed bj the fruit
men to be illegal and unjustly detrimental
to their trade.
The association is rapidly increasing in
membership. Already 215 firms have
joined. There remain now only about
fifteen or sixteen firms iv the City outside
of the association.
Arrangements were made at the meeting
to hold a grand picnic at San Jose the lat
ter part of next month. All fruit men are
invited.
BITUMEN ON EIGHTH STREET.
Property- Ownen Want the Railroad
Company to Pave.
The property-owners along Eighth street
between Market and Folsom are highly
incensed because the Market-street Rail
road Company is neglecting to pave that
portion of the street between the rails
with bitumen.
A Jew weeks ago the Supervisors award
ed the contract of paving Eighth street
with bitumen to the Pacific Paving Com
pany. Work was beguu soon after, and
concrete bas already been laid along the
east side of the block between Market and
Mission. The entire block and half of the
next block will be completed by the first
of next week.
The failure on the part of the railroad to
remove the cobbles between the rails and
lay concrete alonp with the paving com
pany will seriously impair the pavement
according to the statements of several of
the property-owners.
They wish the railroad to either remove
the track altogether or join with them
and put in bitumen.

FOR CALIFORNIA COAL
The Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association Enters
a Protest.
Measures Adopted to Deter the Stock
ton Asylum From Using a
Foreiga Product.
Strenuous efforts are being put forth by
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Associ
ation to induce the managers of the State
insane asylums to supply those institu
tions with native coal. These efforts re
ceived quite a douche of cold water when
it became known that the Napa Asylum
Trustees had signed a contract for the sup
plying of that institution with Welsh coal.
The association forthwith entered the fol
lowing energetic protest:
Ban Francisco, April 29, 1896.
To the Honorable Hoard of Trustees of the State
Asylum for the Insane, A'apa, CaJ.âGentle
men: Our attention has been called to the
fact that on the 25th inst. bias were
opened at the Napa Asylum for Its supply of
coal, and we art- further informed that the fol
lowing bids were received:
000 tons Welsh coal at #0 03. $3618; 800
tons Clarke c al at $3 65, Sr'29'JO; 800 tons
Clarke cpal being required to evaporate 13,
--888,100 pounds oi water as against GOO tous
of the Welsh.
We are further informed that although there
is a difference of $H9B in favor of the Clarke,
which is a California coal, the contract was
awarded to the parties bidding on Welsh coal
from Great Britain.
This association, numbering among its mem
bers some of the largest taxpayers in the State,
has considered it a part of its duties to call the
attention of State institutions to the fact thnt
they should, at equal price and quality, give
the preference to California manufactures and
products. In this connection communications
have been sent to said public institutions from
time to time.
An interview was had some months since
with Governor Budd on the subject, at which
he declared himscif very warmly in favor of
the patronage of home industries by said pub
lic institutions. Therefore, it was with much
surprise that we hetird of the action of your
board in awarding this contract to the highest
bidder: and supposing that it was an oversight
on your part, we would most respectfully re
quest that you cancel said contract und award
the same in favor of the California coal,
thereby assisting home industries, as well as
saving a large amount to the State.
Trusting that this matter will receive prompt
attention at your hands and awaiting: your
favorable reply, I am, for the association, yours
very truly, g. v. Tacy, Manager.
In order to avert a similar contretemps at
Stqckton, the following letter was sent to
the trustees of the asylum there by Man
ager Tacy :
San Franctsco, April 29, 1896.
To the Honnrablt Board o/ Trustee* of the State
Asylum for the Insane, Stockton, Cat.âGentle
men: We have been informed that on the 23d
inst. bids were opened at Stockton for the coal
supply of the asylum, and that among others
the following bids have been reeeivea; 10,
--315,200 pounds of water evaporated with 500
tons Welsh Â»ts6 83.53415; 10,315,200 pounds
of water evaporated with 822 tons Clarke at
$3 74, Â§3074 48, making 'he differemce in
favor of the Clarke coal (which is the Cali
fornia production) of $340 52.
Although I suppose it is hardly necessary, I
desire to call your attention to the question of
patronizing home products, and urge that the
contract be given for the California (Clarke)
coal. I have no doubt that the bid on ClarKe
coal being lower for equal quality that this
course will be taken by your honoraDle board,
and thanking you in advance, I aua for the
association, yours truly,
8. H. Tacy, Manager.
FIRE PATROL IN DANGER
Report of Assessments for Its
Support Showing a Heavy
Decrease.
SERVICE MUST BE CURTAILED.
Insurance Men Surprised at the
Falling Off in Business During
the Quarter.
The latest development in the demoral
ized insurance situation in this City is the
startling announcement that it is no loncer
possible to maintain the Underwriters'
Fire Patrol on its old basis.
Fully a third reduction in the income of
the patrol, which has done inestimable
service for San Francisco, has taken place
in the last quarter. Twenty fire insurance
companies that on many an occasion have
been saved thousands of dollars by the
patrol's assistance have withdrawn their
support entirely, leaving the remaining
companies to face the question of sustain
ing the patrol.
The first notification of this serious fall
ing off was received by the local insurance
men yesterday. It came in the eighty-fifth
regular assessment notice for the support
of the Fire Patrol ior the quarter ending
March 31. This private circular stated that
at a meeting of the board of directors of the
patrol, held April 28, it was resolved to
levy the eighty-fifth assessment of 1% per
cent on the basis of premium receipts, less
return premiums and reinsurance premi
ums paid to companies contributing to the
expense of the patrol on policies covering
property in San Francisco.
The total number of companies report
ing was fifty-nine. For the corresponding
quarter of 1895 it was seventy-nine and in
189-1 ei?hty-seven. The premium receipts
show a heavy falling away and, conse
quently, the assessment; aggregates little
more than two-thirds of the total figure of
the first quarter ol 1895. For the sake of
comparison the figures are given as follows
for the first quarters in 1894, 1895 and 1896.

The companies which failed to contribute
to the Fire Patrol are the Agricultural of
New York, American of New York, Broad
way, Continental, Delaware, Franklin of
Philadelphia, Germania of New York,
Glenn Falls, Girard, Maedeburg, Mer
chants of New Jersey, Niagara, North
western National, Orient of Hartford,
Pacific of New York, Patriotic of Dublin,
Sun of California, Teutonia of New Or
leans, Traders' of Chicago, Westchester of
New York and Williamsburg City of
Brooklyn. With but two insignificant ex
ceptions, all these companies are Ameri
can. Not one of the wealthy foreign cor
porations failed to give their share to sup
port the patrol.
The decrease in fire insurance business
as shown by the quarterly report was dis
cussed all day long in insurance circles
yesterday. It was noted with misgivings,
for the income had dropped down to an
unprecedentedly low figure. Several com
panies had fallen over 100 per cent in their
receipts. Of the lar.-er companies the
Liverpool, London and Globe fell from $20,
--098 60 to $11,170 15, the Royal Exchange
from $17,945 to $10,197, the -Etna of Hart
ford from $10,445 to $8066, the New Zea
land from $19,780 to $5727.
Some general managers had refused
business at very low rates, and conse
quently they made a poor showing. The
Royal, Fireman's Fund, Commercial
Union, Connecticut, London and Lanca
shire, Queen, Lancashire, German-Ameri
can, Hamburg-Bremen and some otners
increased their incomes.
Insurance men, however, admit that
their business is utterly demoralized in
San Francisco and are beginning to think
seriously of a new compact to sustain
rates. They could not say what would be
the future of the Fire Patrol, although
unlesa some understanding be reached re
garding rates they fear it will not be par
ticularly bright.

MAHONEY MEETS DEFEAT
His Delegation Refused a Place
on the Temporary
Roll.
A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR HIM.
The Battle Must Be Fought en Equal
Ground Before the State
Convention.
The executive committee of the Repub
lican State Central Committee, after an
hour's discussion Jast nignt, decided to
leave the contest between the opposing
delegations from the Fourth Congressional
District to the State Convention.
Mahoney's delegation will not be placed
on the temporary roll, and will not be
allowed to vote on the matter. So that
the battle will have to be fought in Sacra
mento.
There were twenty of the thirty-one
members of the executive committee pres
ent, with P. B. Cornwall in the chair and
Jake Steppacher acting as secretary. At
8:20 p. M. the meeting was called to order
and non-members were requested to air
themselves in the hallway. At 9:20 o'clock
the door of the committee - room was
opened, and the members thereof emerged
from the cigar-smoke and wended their
way homeward.
It was learned that fthe discussion on
both sides was temperate and gentle
manly. John D. Spreckela and Senator
Mahoney represented the two heads of the
contest. .
The Senator seemed to be disappointed
that his delegation could not get on the
temporary roll, as that would be quite a
victory for his side, and he seemed to feel
the disappointment keenly.
There was no other business transacted
by the committee, and the Mahoney con
tingent went away mourning.
IMPURE JELLIES.
Letter on the Subject From the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association
to the Board of Health.
Jellies composed for the most part of
glucose, horses' and cows' feet, old livers
and cheap flavoring extracts are said to be
on sale in many oi the grocers' shops of
the City. The matter being brought to
the notice of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association that body has ad
dressed the following communication to
the City Board of Health:
San Francisco. April 27, 1896.
To the Honorable the Board ofHtaUh of tltc City
and County of Han Francisco: Gk.nti.emenâln
formaiion has reached us that there is now a
great flood of Impure jellies in the San Fran
cisco market, which is endangering not -inly
tnat Weld of manufacture in California, but
also is a menace to the heal h of the
community.
We understand that this matter has already
been called to your attention and that you are
now making some investigations of the same,
and we write this letter to urge that you make
such investigations as thorough as may be in
your power, and that if your investigations
warrant it wa hope that decisive steps will be
taken to stamp out the evil. Yours truly,
Fred H. Dingle, Assistant secretary.THE OREGON IS
READY FOR WAR
The Big Battle-Ship Is
Floated in Full Equip
ment.
PREPARING FOR A TEST.
The Eighty-Mile Run Will Be
Undertaken Probably Next
Monday.
CONDITIONS OF THE TRIAL.
The Amount of a Heavy Bonus D?.
pendant Upon the Speed
Attained.
The Oregon is ready for war. With her
bottom painted white a* the wings of a
dove of peace ?he Boated out of the dock
at the Union Iron Works at 30 minutes
past midnight, equipped and armed to
drive certain jueged terrors to the heart
of the enemies of this United States.
The big battle-ship, which for four years
lias bam la the course of building at the
Union Iron Works, '.vent into the drydock
three days ago to have the final attention
paid to her, short of coaling up. In the
three days she has been made a fit mem
bpr of the white squadron in point of
color. Last night the water tunnels were
ci; ened, the gate wa? floated and at high
tide, shortly after midnight, lour tugs
hauled her into deep water.
Bne was run to a bouy in the bay near
the I'nion Iron Works and this mornine,
tie lishters already waiting, a supply
of coul and provisions will be tafcen on for
the official trial and test of speed.
The preparations for the test will go for
ward as speedily as possible now and will
be completed this week. The course of
forty miles haÂ« been laid off close along
the coast south of Santa Barbara. The trial
will be made just as soon as everything is
ready and ;f the weather is proper may be
made on Monday next. The conditions
require Â» minimum of fifteen knots during
four consecutive hours. During that time
everything must work to the approval of
the examining board of naval officers,
which, so far as the world knows, is yet to
be appointed.
For every one-quarter of a knot faster
than the required fifteen the Union Iron
Works receives a bonup of $25,000. No
attempt, therefore, will be made to save
coal on the occasion. She will be com
manded by Captain Charles Miner Goodall
for the trial trip, and will carry on the
occasion not less than 200 men.
Chief Engineer Robert Forsyth of the
Union Iron "Works said last night: "There
is every indication that the trial will be
entirely successful. The battle-ship is
now complete. The only thing to be done
is to shine things np, which will not be
done until it is accepted by the examining
board and we prepare to turn her over to
the Government.
"The Oregon," continued Mr. ForsyUi.
"is one of the three great battle-ships built
for the Government. The Cramps built
the other two, the Indiana and the Mass
achusetts. The Oregon will compare in
every particular with the great battleships
of the world and demonstrates the ability
of San Francisco to com pete in the highest
cla-s of ship building. All we want is
more ships to build. The prestige of tne
Cramps and the Clyde stands them in
great stead of course, but we have done
tiie work here, and if we were constantly
eni ployed we could gather here a coni
mu'nity of proficient men that would
soon, by their successful work, establish
as great a name as any."
MRS. V. N. JOHNSON DIES
Victim of a Trolley-Car Accident,
She Succumbs to Her
Injuries.
Coroner Hawkins Notified and the Case
Will Be Thoroughly In
vestigated.
The deadly trolley has added another to
its long list of fatalities. Last evening Mrs.
V. N. Johnson, wife of Special Pension
Examiner V. N. Johnson, who was run
down by a Turk-street electric car on the
24th inst., succumbed to the injuries she
then received.
Mrs. Johnson, who resided at 612 Van
Ness avenue, bad been making a purchase
at a meat market on Turk street, just west
of Van Ness avenue.
It is not ordinarily dangerous to cross
the thoroughfare at that point, and owing
to that fact Mrs. Johnson did not take un
usual precaution in crossing the track.
Just as Bhe had passed over the track,
however, the startling alarm-bell of an
east-bound car rilled her with consterna
tion.
Looking up she saw the car bearing
down upon her at a frightful speed. The
horror of the situation caused her to lose
h!1 presence of mind, and in her confusion
she turned and started to recross the track.
Tie motorman tried his best to check
the momentum of his car, but it was too
late and the unfortunate woman was
hurled to tne ground and dragged quite a
distance over the cobbles. After consider
able dirficnlty she was removed from her
position under the car and taken to her
home, which was only about a block
distant.
When the matter was reported to the
railway company's headquarters Dr. C.
W. Ward, one of the company's staff,
visited the injured woman in order to
ascertain the exact extent of her injuries.
A cursory examination convinced the
doctor that the injuries were extremely
Ferimis. â¢ Mr. Johnson then summoned
Dr. Itagen, who cared for Mrs. Johnson up
to the time of her death.
Coroner Hawkins was notified of Mr?.
Johnson's death Jast night, and he imme
diately detailed Deputy Coroner O'Brien
to investigate the case. An autopsy will
Le held by Dr. J. 8. Barrett to-day in order
that the exact cause of death may be as
certained and the responsibility placed
where it belongs.

BRAND NEW MEDICOS
Eleven Get Their Diplomas
From Hahneman Col
lege.
CLASS NUMBER THIRTEEN.
Appropriate Exercises to Mark the
Completion of the Course and
the Start for Fame.
Eleven new doctors emerged frpm the
chrysalis state last evening, and having
received their diplomas are now ready to
open offices. They formed the graduating
class of the Hahneman Hospital C'olleee,
the thirteenth since the college opened,
and the degree of M. D. was conferred
upon them in N. S. G. W. Hall with fitting
ceremony.
There was no lack of attendance, the
hall was tilled to the doors; there was no
lack of applause nor of congratulations
and frasrant flowers, and intermingled
were choice words of advice and warning
from those who are turning from the end
of the path which the graduates are just
entering.
Professor William Simpson, M.D., of
San Jose, delivered the address of wel
come. He extended greeting to the au
dience which had assembled to cheer ana
enthuse the graduates as they took their
first step forward, not as college Meddlings,
but as men and women fit to battle with
the most dreaded enemies of the race â
pain and death.
Continuing, Dr. Simpson said :
Your alma mater has said you are prepared
for the contest. In the presence of this army
of cheering and supporting friends; before
these footlights and in the flush of success in
passing the crucial and dreuded test. of your
examinations the answer seems ensy, but in
the quiet of your own closet, in the inmost
sanctuary of ycur very souls, in the sickroom,
in the chamber where the life of the mother
and her unborn babe depends upon the
rapidity of your thought and the deftness of
yourhiind; in the hushed and awful chamber
of death â death from whom there can be no
escapeâ death, before whom all must yield,
whether they be ti.e young, ihe beautiful or
the gifted, a relentless enemy, insisting upon
having his victim. How under these circum
stances will you answer to God and to your
own conscience?
When you go out from this hall to-night with
till' right to enter upon this light fully con
ferred, if you nre satisfied with your prepara
tion, if you are full of self-coulidenec and be
lieve that with your student life your studies
are ended, tear your diplomas Into fragments
and seek some occupation where conceit out
ranks brains. You have already worn out
your welcome, and mine and that of your alma
mater and of the whole profession is yours no
longer. You are preparing to use it most un
worthily and it is withdrawn.
If you so faithfully perform your work that
you compel those who meet you to sny, "I am
proud 10 know you," "You are on honor to
the profession," at the last there will be friends
to take up the lost thread for yoa and the tears
that fall for yau will not be the forced drops of
hired mourners, but the real evidence of the
loving regret your life work has earned.
Rev. George E. Walk delivered an ad
dress in which he compared the physician,
or the minister of the body, to the clergy
man, the minister of the soul. Each
should be above reproach, he said, for the
man who cures the consciences need be no
better morally than he who enters the
privacy of a home to cure the ailing body.
Frank Coflin rendered two vocal selec
tions, ana at the close of the programme
the graduates were handed their diplomas
and then together they subscribed to the
hippocratic oath.
The graduates were: Hessie Crosby
Armstrong of (Jranville, Ohio; Frank
Luce Bateman and Lillie Boldeman, of
San Francisco; Mary Dun lap Chisholm of
Wentwortu. Nova Scotia; Harriett How
ell of Los Gatos, Cal.; Mary Elien Hof
iuann of Philadelphia, Pa. ; Jera Morton
Mansfield of Napa, Cal.; John Brian Mc-
Nally of San FranciÃCo; Clarence Denver
Potter, CharJes Kendall Small and Alda
Inez Thompson, of Oakland.

Surprises at the French
Benevolent Society
Election.
WEILL WAS DISGUSTED.
Besides the President Nine Di
rectors Gave Up Their
Portfolios.
NEW SURGEON AND SPECIALIST
De Marville and Mayer Borne to
Victory on a Tidal Wave
of Excit ment.
The spirit of unrest of the French Min
istry flashed over from the home country
as by heliograph, intensified by the (5000
miles traversed, could not have raised
more "Cain" than the proceedings of the
meeting of the Societe Francaise de Bien
faisanee Mutuelle, held last evening at 318
Post street.
This is the greatest organization the
French have on this coast, numbering
nearly 1000 members on its roll, and it has
been in existence for more than thirty
years.
As the name would indicate it is purely
a benevolent association, the benefits of
which are principally the subscribers or
members' privileges to enjoy the use of
the French Hospital or to have its visiting
physicians call at their domicile.
Quite recentlyâ not over three weeks
agoâ an election was held by the members
to select an executive committee of fifteen
members and resident as well as visiting
physicians.
The by-laws of the society require that
all candidates must receive a majority of
the votes cast to be elected, and on this
proposition a rock was struck which is
likely to shake the entire institution to
such an extent that younger and more ener
getic timber will have to be put into it to
save it from destruction.
Drs. G. Gross and Bourgougnon de Mnr
ville, two highly esteemed and capable
physicians, were in opposition for the post
of visiting physician.
Dr. Gross had held the office for nearly
a dozen years and de Marville, who is
comparatively k new man in this country
and wih. the society, made no effort to
j-ecure election. He polled a heavy vote,
however. To be sure it was not enough
to eiect him, but it crippled Dr. Gross 7
vote considerably. The latter was de
clared elected, but one of the de Marville
faction noticing that Grops' vote did not,
show a majority of those cast demurred to
his taking office.
This strange state of affairs came about
in ' us wise: There were 505 votes cast,
the majority required being 278 votes.
Gross got only 273, owing to the fact that
G7 votes cast on the total were declared
illegal by the election board.
To test whether Dr. Gross is entitled to
his seat the matter was recently brought
up before Judge Slack, and is to be Heard
on May 4.
This friction -was but an opening to last
night's shake up.
The executive committee of fifteen mem
bers were in session to select a resident
surgeon for the hospital, a position which
lias been held for a number of terms by
Dr. Charles Brigham. It was a pretty
well understood thing that he would be
re-elected, when the bombshell exploded.
Brigham's friends were not prompt
enough to close the nominations, and
some ore blurted out:
"I place Dr. Bourgougnon de Marville
in nomination.''
The move caught on like a feather to a
muddy stick. The young physician's
popularity and the fact that he was known
to De a satisfactory candidate to nianv of
the voters at the last election pushed him
to the front.
The vote was CBst and, to the consterna
tion of President Sylvain Weill, and, in
fact, of some of the others, De Marville
was elected on the first ballot.
There was an immediate hubbub and a
motion for reconsideration, which was sat
upon.
President Weill, the strongest supporter
of Dr. Bryham, felt quite sore and was not
backward in expressing his sorrow that
such an old practitioner and servant of
the society had been voted out.
But this was not all. The last straw fol
lowed soon after. Dr. Samuel Boyd came
up supposedly as the only candidate as
specialist. But the eruptions had not
ceased. Somebody again, in a spirit of
fun or contradiction, placed Dr. Oscar J.
Mayer in nomination, ami he was carried
to victory on the tidal- wave.
"Ca e'est trop fort!" exclaimed Presi
dent Weill, rising to the occasion. Then,
hesitating a few seconds and viewing the
assemblage, he remarked:
"Gentlemen, I herewith desire to pre
sent my resignation as president and as a
director of the Societe Francaise de Bien
faisance Mutuelle."
The levity and gibes indulged in prior to
this were bushed. Each member realized
the loss the society was incurring and
protests innumerable were beard on all
sides, but Mr. Weill would not withdraw
his resignation.
At this juncture the strangest of
all things occurred. One after the other
ten members of the directory, eight of
whom had voted for the candidates who
were objectionable to Mr. Weill, jumped
up and like so many firecrackers snapped
out their respective resignations. The
scene was a lively one, and when it was
all over the dazed members grouped in
twos and threes to discuss results.
As the matter stands the president and
Secretary J. Deschamps are out and there
is no one to call the next general meeting,
which alone can replace them.
The only four members left in the di
rectory out of tifteen are :
P. Carnes, J. Bergez, C. A. Lemoine and
L. Bocqueraz.
Those who resigned besides President
Weili are: I. Culnin, E. Messager, J.
Deschamps, O. Bozio, L. Carraine, F.
Fagothey, F. Queyrel, F. A. Bergerot, M.
Rooa and A. O.rtion.

MILLIONS MAY
COME TO HER
Miss Eleanor Calhoun, the
Heiress of Andrew
J. Davis.
DETECTIVES AT WORK.
A Famous Will Contest Which
Is Now Rapidly Drawing
to a Close.
A COMPROMISE MAY RESULT.
Something About the Celebrated
Struggle for the Butte
Miner's Wealth.
Strong interest has been revived in the
celebrated contest over the $4,000,000 estate
of Andrew J. Davis, the deceased million
aire, late of Butte, Montana, who died
indrew J. Davis, t :e Butie Miner Whose Millions May Be Harmoniously Divided
in the >"ear Future.
about six years ago, by the knowledge that
during the past few weeks detectives have
been at work in this State endeavoring to
secure evidence to be used against Mrs.
Huida Snell-Davis of Tehachapi, who
claims to be the widow of the deceased
millionaire, and Mrs. Mary Isabella Mor
row of Fresno and Mrs. Laura A. Caihoun
of this City, daughters of Mrs. Snell-Davis.
With what success the trial of the case,
which is expected to take place before the
summer vacation of the Montana court,
will determine.
At this juncture, too, Miss Eleanor Cal
houn, granddaughter of Millionaire Davis,
arrives from New York. Yesterday she
stated that she was in hopes that a com
promise would be brought about. Miss
Caihqun has suffered from a complete loss
of voice and comes to recruit her strength
with a period of rest in congenial sur
roundings.
Thus far the developments in this case
have been of a most romantic and extraor
dinary character, and the future, judging
from the determined manner in which
tne various contestants are at work, prom
ises to be productive of even more sensa
tional facts and incidents.
From dispatche? recently out to different
parties in the United States from Helena,
Mont., it appears that Mr. Cavanaugh,
the Montana resident attorney of Mrs.
Snell-Davis and her two daughters, is
about to bring up for trial the contest,
which he has filed on their behalf to the
will of Andrew J. Davis.
Mr. Davis was a man who presumably
died a bachelor, leaving a very large es
tate, which he had amassed in Montana
Bnd other places. It consists of the prin
cipal ownership and stock of the First
National Bank of Butte City, Mont., and
the principal interest in the most promi
nent bank of Helena, Mont. He also left
a very valuable mine, which was paying
large returns, and cash in the safe deposit
vaults in Boston to the amount of over a
million and a quarter.
Although Mr. Davis died in March, 1890,
his estate has never got out of the hands
of the special administrator. The reason
for this is that some time after his death
a Bomewhat clumsily drawn will on rough
paper, evidently hastily jotted down, came
into the possession of a woman who had
kept it back.
This will was filed for probate and gave
the bulk of his property to one of his
brothers, thus cutting off six other broth
ers and five sisters, or their descendants,
who all immediately combined, with few
exceptions, to attack the will.
There were three contests filed by three
different sets of these collateral neirs.
Robert G. Ingersoll led the contest for the
iirst set of contestants and a jury trial en
sued lasting over three months and at a
cost to both sides of over $100,(XK). Car
loaas of witnesses were brought from dif
ferent parts of the United States and the
expenses were very great in every respect
The trial resulted in a disagreement of the
jury, which stood, it is claimed, eight
against and four in favor of the will.
On hearing of this Mr. Root, a nephew
of Mr. Davis, who was a clerk in his bank,
claimed that Mr. Davis had made him a
gift in contemplation of his death of a tin
box full of certain bank stock, valued at
over a million dollars. Judge Knowles, a
friend of the deceased, testified that he
heard Mr. Davis tell nis nephew, "This is
for you," at tbe same time handing him
the box containing the securities. Trie
lower court decided In favor of Mr. Root,
riving him this slice of the fortune.
Tile case has since been taken up to the
Supreme Court of Montana on appeal.
Another interesting controversy arose in
connection with the estate in behalf of Pet
Davis, claiming to be an illegitimate
child of Mr. Davis.
Subsequently the contestants repre
sented by Mr. Ingersoll settled their dif
ferences with the brother, who was given
the bulk of the estate under the will, and
they riled a consent to admit the will to
probate with the understanding that the
estate was to be divided between the
brother mentioned in the will and this
particular set of contestants to the exclu
sion of all other brothers and siatars.
In the meantime the other contestants
not knowing that this was going on relied
on the Ingersoll contestants to conduct the
contest, and the first thing they knew was
that the contest was dismissed for the
want of prosecution, thus leaving the field
clear apparently to the favored brother
ana the few contestants who had settled
with him.
The story of the woman who claimed to
be the widow of the deceased millionaire
is the most interesting chapter of this
whole case. Her maiden name Bhe states
was Queen and that she was the daughter
of a tarrner. Her story then is that on
April 15, 1842. in the County of Carroll,
Arkansas, she was married to Andrew J.
Davis, and that two children was born to
thorn, viz.: those who are now Mrs. M. f.
Morrow and Mrs. Laura A. Calhoun. Hr.
Davis she represents as having been of a
very eccentric character, who would ab
sent himself from home for a large part of
the time. In 1849 he left her, saying he
was going to California. Just when he
did go is not known. He was known to be
here from early in the 50's until far into
1856. She supposed he was dead, and
after about three years she married aeain,
but not until she had heard that he was
dead.
She came to Fort Tejon, Cal., ahout
1854. In 1855, while she vtas living there,
A. J. Davis came to see her, and told her
he had been successful in miDing and
other enterprises, and blamed her for
again marrying, while she blamed him for
not keeping her posted on his movements.
He saw the children, spoke to them and
told them who he was. After making
them all presents of some gold he went
away. She heard nothing more of him
until she heard of his death in Butte.
Alter his death persons who were inter
ested in her behalf took to her quite a
large number of different photographs of
men, and among them was that of the de
ceased millionaire. This woman, Mrs.
Snell-Davis, looked them over, and imme
diately recognized that of Andrew J. Da
vis as her husband.
Among the interesting features of the
case is the fact that Nellie Calhoun, to
whom William 11. Hearst, the proprietor
of this City and of the Journal of New
York City, was reported to be encaged, is
the daughter of Mrs. Laura A. Caihoun,
and the alleged granddaughter of the de
ceased Montana millionaire.
Those who are opposed to the claims of
the alleged widow and her daughters deny
in toto the claims of Airs. Snell-Davis.
They allege that her husband was an
Abraham Davis and of a different family
altogether, and that he had no connection
whatever with Andrew J. Davis, the de
ceased millionaire. They further state
that they can prove the residence else
where of the Montana DaMs^ during the
time it is claimed he went to Arkansas and
married Miss Queen.
It is the brothers and sisters of the de
ceased millionaire who have sent detectives
to this State to investigate the claims of
Mrs. Snell-Davis and her daughters.
In the meantimo the special administra
tor and the fortunate nephew of Mr.
Davis are in the enjoyment and control of
the estate and have great influence in the
part of Montana where they reside and do
business
Lloyd Tevis of this City has been for a
long time in negotiation with the purpose
in view of rendering the necessary finan
cial aid to the California claimants in
return for a certain percentage of the
amount to which they may establish their
claim. At the present time the attorneys
for Mrs. Snell-Davis and her daughters are
Alva E. Snow of Fresno, ex-Judge Harris
of Fresno and James M, Haven of Haven
& Haven of this City.
BEFORE THE GRAND JURY
The Board of Health Has Been
Called For to Hold a
Conference.
City and County Hospital Supplies
Will Be Investigated as Well
as Other Matters.
The recent visit of the Grand Jury to the
City and County Hospital and Almshouse
is apparently about to bear fruit in the
way of a conference between the jury and
the Board of Health.
Suortly after the visit mentioned the
Grand Jury sent a communication to the
board, in which mismanagement in the
City and County Hospital was plainly
charged, and it was intimated that a rigid
investigation of the institution would be
carried out. The secretary of the Grand
Jury notified the secretary of the board
that a conference was desired immediately,
but as Dr. Mor-e was in San Luis Obispo
the matter was deferred until Friday next,
when all of the members will be in the
City.
The matters that will be particularly in
quired into are the quality of the supplies
furnished the institution by the contract
ors, to whom contracts are let by the
Board of Supervisors, and the necessity of
the training school for nurses, which costs
the City several thousands per year. The
jury is under the impression that the sup
plies, at least in some instances, are far
below the standard called for in the ad
vertised bids, and desires to sift the re
sponsibility and place it on the right
shoulders. The members believe that
Superintendent Stable should have re
jected many articles of food that they saw
at the hospital.
The training school will come in for
close scrutiny, because the jurymen believe
that the money spent on it could be better
employed in hiring help to keep the insti
tution in a cleanly condition.
The man with the theory that luck will
even up in the long run is still trying to
borrow a dollar with which to test his
theory.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 30, 1896.
TWO DISTRICT SQUABBLES
The Republican Fifth Congres
sional Committee Listens
to Contests.
WILL SETTLE THINGS TO-DAY.
Factions in the Thirty-Seventh and
Fortieth Make Charges Which
Are Denied.
The Congressional committee of the
Fifth District wrestled all day yesterday
with two Assembly district squabbles in
this City, and, not getting through with
the hearing of testimony and arguments,
adjourned until 10 a. m. to-day without
passing any judgments or taking any of
ficial action.
At the meeting to-day the committee,
which is a canvassing and returning board,
with authority over all contests arising
out of the selection of delegates to ihe
coming State Convention, will decide the
contests from the Thirty-seventh, Fortieth
and Forty-first Assembly districts of San
Francisco, give final judgment in the
County Committee returns of convention
delegates from Santa Clara and San Mateo
counties and from the seven districts of
San Francisco lying within the Fifth Con
gressional district, and issue credentials
to the delegates.
But four of the seven members of the
committee were present when the meeting
was called to order at 11 a. m. in the law
office of John E. Richards in the Crocker
building. The four were James W. Rea,
chairman; John E. Richards, secretary;
Robert Tophtz and Al Stetson.
There were on hand a throng of factional
Republicans from the Thirty-seventh and
Fortieth districts. It was decided to hear
the Fortieth District contest first and the
Fortieth District crowd stayed and grew,
while the little army from the Thirty
seventh withdrew to return with re-enforce
ments in the afternoon.
These contests are wholly confined in
their party significance to their respective
districts and represent no schism or oppo
sition extending beyond the question of
district control and recognition among
district elements.
In each case the contestants represent
small minorities, which, before the pri
maries, refused the measure of representa
tion on the regular tickets offered them by
the other elements which made up the
regular district delegations to the State
Convention. In each case the contestants
put up opposition tickets which, the con
testants admit, received comparatively
small minorities of the votes legitimately
cast. The contestants, however, allege, in
each case, that the frauds were perpetrated
by the representatives of the majority
factions in control of the election machin
ery, and the contests are based on these
charges of fraud rather tiian on any claim
tbat the contestants would have received
a majority of the votes cast, if all had gone
fairly.
In each case the most that is hoped for
is that the Congressional Committee will,
in the belief that frauds were really com
mitted by somebody, and in the interest of
harmony, award the contestants portions
of the delegation. The victorious fac
tions naturally oppose with vigor such a
step. In both districts the A. P. A. and
ami- A 1 . P. A. elements cut a partial figure
in the alignment of forces.
The Fortieth District is the one repre
sented in the County Committee by Jesse
L. Marks, who has acted in harmony with
the County Committee and who used his
influence in giving ail elements in his dis
trict as fair a division of representation as
couid be Drought about amid the exigen
cies of district politics.
The contestants from this district were
loud and indignant and the regulars were
just as loud and indignant later. The
charges were that repeaters operated all
day in the interest of the regular ticket;
that challenges were ignored and that
generally the regulars, having the inside,
carried things by usual primary election
methods. The gist of the evidence was:
"You did" and "we didn't."
O. W. Winthrop was spokesman for the
I contestants. He offered a petition alleg
j ing frauds and asking that the election be
I declared void and that the committee ap
j point a delegation. He stated that he hud
affidavits in support of the charges of
fraud, and callei as a wimesH H. H.
! Holmes, who was one of the opposition
candidates for delegate and who acted as
a challenger ai one of the polling places.
He said that he .Â«aw a number of men
vote three or four times and that the name
of M. H. de Young was voted several
I times. Other witnesses for the con
testants gave similar testimony. On cross
examination Holmes admitted that the
opposition polled but ten votes at one
polling-place and sixty-six at the other
and the regulars made a Btrong point on
this showing of residual equity.
County Committeeman Jesse Marks
testified at length and with positive ness
that the election had been fair, that all
challenges had been allowed and that the
vote was honestly counted. All the charges
were denied in detail. Holmes and Irving
of the opposition admitted that at the
upper end everything was fairly conducted
and that the alleged frauds were confined
to the lower end.
Marks was supported by the similar tes
timony of B. D. Pike, John Carson, B. F.
Miller, John 0. Nobmann, W. L. Cole,
Thomas Eager, William Wilkinson and H.
W. Miller of the regular delegates; by
William Klinger, Joseph Peckman, O. G.
Hallett and Frank Bauer, election officers,
and by other witnesses.
The Fortieth District was taken under
advisement and then the committee took
lunch.
The- fight in the Thirty-seventh District
is more bitter and complicated than that
of the Fortieth, and is decorated with
more of the picturesqueness of district
politics. It took the committee from 2to
6:30 p. m. to hear what the factions had to
offer.
James Alva Watt is the County Coramit
teeman from this district, and during the
anteprimary skirmishing made every ef
fort to get the faction led by Ed Donnelly
and some others to accept two or three
delegates and become a sample of harmony.
They demanded four delegates or a fight,
and the fight came.
Two or three times in the afternooon the
regulars showed a disposition to let into
the record a story that two years ago Don
nelly was with the top and victorious in
side, and that his protest describing the
frauds charged was a mild description of
the primary of 18y4, but the committee
wouldn't admit any irrelevant bygones.
The contest displayed the presence on
both sides of Republicans of high char
acter, eminent respectability and honesty
of purpose, and between them were sand
wiched, in story and in person, representa
tives of the "push."
Judge Marcus J. Waldheimer appeared
as* chief prosecutor for the contestants, and
bis spirit was fair, though strong. James
Alva Watt handled the case for the regu
lftrs, assisted by Attorney George A. Went
worth.
Besides the charges of frauds in the way
of repeating, there was as a basis of the
contest the charge that the opposition was
not given representation on the boards of
election officers, or given tickets admitting
their watchers to the polling-places. I
The charges of fraud were not only vig
orously denied by the regulars, but testi
mony was piled up to the effect that the
opposition massed at the polls a gang of
toughs, including Hector Brodie and oth
ers from the water front, and John O' Shea,
a member of the Buckley General Com
mittee, who acted as challenger for the
opposition, all of whom attempted and
committed fraud. Watt's showing was
further that Donnelly presented no nomi
nations for election otlicers, as he was told
to do, before they were appointed by the
County Committee, and that while the
representatives of the opposition were not
entitled to cards of admission through
.having failed to comply with conditions
prescribed in the election call, he h"Â»d of
fered to let their representatives inside
anyway, and did do so.
Ed Donnelly's testimony was lengthy,
but under Watt's cross-examination it
somewhat petered oat into a general state
ment that he knew that repeating had
been done.
Dr. O'Connell, a vigorous young man,
said that he saw one man vote seven times,
and concluded to protest when he tried it
the eighth time.
Attorney Wentworth asked if "Windy
Dick" Stapleton and Jack Short were not
working for the opposition ticket all day,
but the witness didn't know.
"Do you know, doctor," asked John E.
Richards, "whether the bona-fide Repub
lican voters of trie district turned out gen
erally on that day?"
"Well, I understand so," was the reply.
The witness had seen no RepuDlican re
fused an opportunity to vote.
James E. Fields declared, that in a saloon
he saw a vote mill where cards were given
out to repeaters, but he couldn't tell the
name of anybody who had voted anybody
else's name. He gave the information that
the opposition threw up its hands and
quit at 3 p. m.
Chief Wharfinger George W. Root was
one of the main witnesses, as he was one
of the leading figures smonj: the oppo
sition. He was charged with having got
Hector Brodie and Tommy Lenihan to
bring a gang from the water front into the
district. He said that he did not ask
Brodie and Lenihan to go there but solely
to help spot people.
Martin Donovan and John H. Kelly,
watchers for the opposition, gave testi
mony for the opposition about repeating
which became general assertions under
cross-examinatton.
For the regulars Charles H. "Ward, in
spector at polling - place 1, submitted
an affidavit that John O'Shea and. others
did various wrongs in behalf of the oppo
sition; that no challenges were allowed;
that Democrats and non-residents swore
in their votes in behalf of the opposition
and that the election was fairly conducted.
There was much testimony about an
alleged howling mob that vainly repre
sented the opposition and about frauds,
gangs and threats of stealing the ballot
box.
R. C. McLennon, Paul Fowler, James
Toomey and Fred Eggers testified, and then
James Alva Watt made a brief and com
prehensive statement, in which he demon
strated the fairness which had been shown
to an intractable opposition, and with
which the election had been conducted.
There was no charge that the opposition
ticket would have been elected, anyhow.
The opposition wanted time to present
further evidence, and adjournment was
taken until this morning at 10 o'clock.
The committee will not probably con
sume much time to-day over the farcical
contest filed by Leon Dennery, the ex-
County Committeeman of the^Forty -first
District.
THE REPUBLIC IS LOST.
Return of the Fearless and Vigi
lant After a Vain Search
for Her.
She Probably Capsized in Saturday's
Gale and Went Down
Bodily.
The tugs Fearless and Vigilant got back
from a four days' cruise after the British
ship Republic last night. The vessel was
burned at sea when 250 miles off the coast,
and the tugs were sent out to look for her
after Captain Hughes had abandoned her.
When the tugs went out Captain Has
kell, in the Fearless, took the north and
west course, while Captain Randell, in the
Vigilant, took the south and east direc
tion. Neither tug spoke the other one
until yesterday morning, when, after
scouring 100 miles of ocean each, they
gave up the search and headed for San
Francisco. When a few miles off the Faral
lones they ran across each other and came
back into port almost neck and neck.
"1 don't think the Republic is above
water," said Captain Dan Haskell last
night. "Saturday and Sunday it was ter
ribly rough and squally, and if the burn
ing Republic was then afloat she would
not have lived an hour. Sunday night
and Monday last the weather was beauti
ful, and we had a splendid time, but saw
no sign of the burning ship. We could
see for over fifteen miles, and I spoke the
bark Don in &.47 north, 126.15 west. She
was on her way from Puget Sound for
South Africa, and I had no trouble in
making her out. Tuesday morning I
spoke the schooner Bertie Minor in lati
tude 36.30 north, longitude 124. 10 west, and
the captain reported 'all well.' "
Captain Clem Randell reports that in the
position in which the" Republic was
abandoned he saw'a floating spar, and the
chances are that it was part of the burning
ship. Insurance men and ship-owners are
now satisfied that the Republic has filled
ana gone down. She is never expected to
be heard f rom again.
Superintendent Hawley of the Spreckels'
line is going to have a new means of get
ting information from the ocean. A
pigeon cote is to be built at the Oceanic
dock and every steamer that goes out on a
long cruise will take a homing bird. For
instance, the Australia for Honolulu and
the Alarneda, Mariposa and Monowai for
Australasia will take birds out with them
for a couple of hundred miles and they
will then be released. If any vessel is in
sight or in distress the news will come at
once to Spreckels' dock and a tug will be
sent out. It will be the same in the case
of tags, and the Fearless and Vigilant will
be able in this manner to keep the office
posted.
Reunion at Mills College.
The graduates and former pupils of Mills
Seminary and College are invited to spend
next Saturday, May 'Z. "founder's day," at the
old house. It any have failed to receive invi
tations they will still consider vhat they are
cordially invited. From the City they should
tate the 9 and 10 o'clock boats and Oakland
local traia to Fruitvale, thence by the Califor
nia Railroad to Mills College station.
DEMOCRATS ON
THE PRESIDENCY.
No Candidate Yet Rides on
a Wave of Popular
Favor.
THE FIELD WIDE OPEN.
The Party Is Not Getting Up
Any Enthusiasm About It,
Anyway.
CARLISLE'S FEDERAL BRIGADE.
Leading Local Democrats Have All
Sorts of Ideas and No Ideas
About Candidates.
There is in the local Democratic ranks
no general enthusiastic wave of favor for
any man who might be exalted to the seat
which Jefferson and Jackson and Grover
have occupied if this were a Democratic
year.
Local Democrats don't know whom they
want for President.
In that they are like the Democrats of
the entire country. It is remarkable and
yet not remarkable that here at about the
Ist of May no Democratic boom for any
favorite son has caused enough stir in
Democratic waters to rock a ship.
The Democratic party is not displaying
any particular hurry about anything, "feel
ing any severe itching for the Chicago con
vention or any deep thrills over the ap
proaching election.
Among local Democrats we may easily
get the impression that the party realizes
that it is going to be banged, and that it is
going to make the best of it. It is making
about as much fuss as a clam in a clam
digger's tin pail. Most of the local Demo
cratic politicians feel that there is nothing
to be gained in National politics this year,
and so they are turning their ambitions
and energies to the local situation, in the
hope of being able to capture a few muni
cipal offices. The active interest in the
coming State Convention is due to its in
fluence on the factional fortunes of the
local party in municipal politics. On this
cff-Democratic year few are aspiring to be
sent to Chicago to spend several hundred
dollars and vote for a loser.
There are of course still other reasons
for the general party stolidity in refer
ence to Presidential candidates, though
this is the main one. The Republicans
are to move first at St. Louis, and the
Democrats will want to see what is done
there. Then the financial question is one
from which the party is yet shrinking,
and about which it is early to tell what is
best to be done. The strongly threaten
ing danger of a wide-opan split in the
National Convention, the uncertainties
that yet attend many State conventions
and tne uncertainties of what will come
from the actions of the free silver party
| and its late National Convention at St.
Louis are also things that repress any for
wardness in Presidential booms.
Cleveland seems reliably out of the race.
lowa will present Boies, or at least the
silver element of the party will. Pattison
will be Pennsylvania's favorite son. Mas
sachusetts has set up its young executive,
Russell. Morgan is talked of amid the tele
grams about his possible death. Whitney
looms up with perhaps especial strength
and promise. Secretary Carlisle has long
been in the field, and the Federal brigades
of the whole country must be either for
him or not against, and David B. Hill is
not without many admirers. The silver
question Drings opposition to many of
these in California and elsewhere.
One will chase around some time in San
Francisco before he finds three Democrats
of both any mind and the same mind on
Democratic candidates.
John Daggett. superintendent of the
Mint, is for Carlisle with all his teeth and
his ten toenails, but he wouldn't say so
for publication yesterday.
"I do not wish to discuss the matter," he
said. "I know nothing about Presidential
candidates and haven't heard any talk
about them."
Others of the Federal brigade were
about equally non-committal when inter
viewed. The uncertainties of the State
Convention â or, perhaps, rather tne cer
taintyâthat it will have a majority for
silver while practically ail the adminis
tration forces in the State will back the
gold end, may have something to do with
the reluctance of Federal office-holders
to talk ju%t now.
"I am for the nominee of tho party."
was the way the Collector of Internal
Revenue, O. M. Welburn, discussed Presi
dential candidates.
Said District Attorney H. S. Foote:
"I will support the nominee of the party.
I have no choice for the nomination. 1
am not thinking about men. There are
plenty of distinguished men in the Demo
cratic party capable of filling the great
office of President."
"You are asking me a question, my son,
that I cannot answer," said John H. Wise,
Collector o! the Port, when spoken to on
the subject. "Carlisle is a good man, a
great man and a brilliant statesman, but
just whether he would be acceptable to the
entire California delegation or not I don't
know. Personally I hare no choice in the
matter, and therefore I cannot express an
opinion. As to Cleveland and the third
term proposition that is all nonsense.
Cleveland does not want the nomination
and would not take it if it was offered to
him. He will retire into private life at the
end of his administration, and if the out
cry may be somewhat against him now he
will be revered a generation hence."
"Carlisle will never be the choice of the
Democrats of California," said E. L. Col
non, president of the State Board of Har
bor Commissioners, yesterday. "He is a
great man, a very great man, but his rec
ord on the money question is against him,
and the people of this State will never
tolerate him as a Presidential possibility.
"We have lost confidence in him owing to
his change of front, and confidence once
lost takes a long time to restore. Russell,
Pattison and Boies are all great men, and
stand high in the estimation of their coun
trymen, but they are all in the same boat
with Carlisle. Not one of them will sat
isfy ihe majority of the Democratic voters
of California."
"If Russell. Pattison, Boies and Carlisle
are not available, who in your mind is the
most likely candidate?" was asked.
"Morgan of Alabama," saia President
Colnon without a moment's hesitation.
"He is sound on the money question, and
from my point of view the money question
overshadows every other issue. As I said
before, Carlisle will never be our choice. I
feel strongly on this subject and I am con
fident that a man who will stand up for
sound money will get the nomination."
Bert Schlesinaer, second assistant
United States Attorney, said: <l I favor
any man for the Democratic nomination
that can carry the labor element of the
country with him and who will deal with
the corporations with impartiality."
Louis Loupe, Cuiel Deputy of Internal
Revenue, said : "My individual choice for
the nomination would be Carlisle."
"Whitney and Morgan or Hill and Mor
gan or Whitney and Hill for first place "
said Dr. Joseph Pe^cia, "or almost an"
Western Democrat would suit me. I am
not hard to please, but would like to see
the best men in the party placed on the
ticket. I fancy that the Democrats will be
influenced by the nominations of the St.
Louis convention."
"W. C. Whitney represents my senti
ment, ' said Max Popper. "He is for
sound money and he represents our views
on the tariff. He is young, active and in
telligent, and would make' a safe, reliable
and vigorous President. His record as
Secretary of the Navy demonstrates his
executive ability. I don't think that Car
lisle is physically the equal of Whitney,
for one thing, and I question the advisa
bility of selecting a candidate from out
side of New York. I believe in the pre
sentation of younger men.
"Pattison would be a good candidate,
but next to Whitney I would favor Russell
of i.fassachusetts. I like his courageous
style. So little has been done or formu
lated yet^ that it is hard to make predic
tions. No one has yet developed any par
ticular strength or made any showing of
leadership. Wait for the State conven
tions. I think that the California delega
tion will go and have no idea whom the
favorite here will turn out to be."
"Pattison has the warm place in my
heart," said Alex T. Vogelsang. "I am
a silver man and Pattison is a sound
money man, but I thintc that both the Re
publican and Democratic parties will take
conservative stands on this question. Pat
tison would be a strong candidate on the
Pacific Coast on account of his record as a
member of the Government Railroad Com
mission. His minority report on the af
fairs of the Central "and Union Pacific
roads burns yet. Russell is a likely man.
Both of these are good and young and
strong men.
"Carlisle* is not as strong as either,
though a better or a more upright man
than John Griffin Carlisle does not live.
He is one of the greatest lawyers of the
United States, but there is a popular
prejudice against him on account of the
bond issues. Whitney would be a strong
candidate, but he won't take it. I think
that Pattison will be the favorite of the
California Democracy."
Barclay Henley is naturally for Pattison,
because Henley in a measure "discovered"
Pattison in National affairs. It was Bar
clay Henley's bill creating the Railroad
Commission passed in 18S6, when Henley
was a member of Congress, that made Pat
tison the Commissioner, as which he De
came more widely known as a man of
ability and strong character.
'â¢Pattison has been twice Governor of
Pennsylvania," said Mr. Henley, "and
would be the strongest candidate avail
able. He is from a central State, is a man
of lofty integrity and high ability, and has
many elements of popularity."
AFTER ABANDONED ROADS
Richmond Residents Want Cer
tain Market-Street Fran
chises Forfeited.
Three Corporation Lines Which Dis
figure the Streets and Impede
Public Travel.
There are two street railroads in the
Richmond district owned by the Market
street Company which have long since
ceased to be a source of revenue to the
City. One commences at Point Lobos
avenue and runs down First avenue four
blocks. The second begins at the junction
of First and Point Lobos avenues, run
ning down the latter thoroughfare to what
is known as the old half-mile track.
In addition to the abandoned roads
named there is a third on Seventh avenue,
beginning at California street, running
thence to the park. Actual service on this
line was only stopped when the Sutro
road began operations, though for eigh
teen months prior to that time the
schedule consisted of two trains a week
one each way on Sunday.
The people of Richmond have grown
weaiy of these street obstructions without
something in return. They are deter
mined, if possible, to have the several
franchises forfeited, and they propose to
go about the worlr systematically. The
two improvement clubsâ the Point Lobos
and the Richmond Districtâ will take up
the matter at their next meeting.
The Point Lobos avenue road is proba
bly the most objectionable of the thrse.
From First avenue to Tenth the tracks for
a time lightly covered up are now from
one to three inches above the level. Con
sidering that this is the main drive to the
beach, and the further fact that it is one
of the handsomest roadways in the City
the people believe that these defacing
marks should be removed. Years ago a
steam dummy ran out Point Lobos to the
Half-mile Race Course, but with the
building of the Bay District Track the line
was abandoned.
The Market-street Company, however,
never lost its grip on the franchise, in spite
of the fact that they did not pay one cent
in taxes. Some months ago they secured
an extension from the Park Commis
sioners, but so far they have not spent $1
toward fulfilling the conditions of the
original franchise.
The exposed tracks have in many places
put the great driveway in terrible condi

more flesh a man has on his bones the greater is the call upon
his vital energies, to feed the large amount of useless tissue, and,
correspondingly, the less is left to the more delicate functions.
That is not a scientific theory. It is a practical truth ; discov-

of portly men who are devoid .of nerve power of manhood.

tion. Driving at night is dangerous and
heavily loaded vehicles find it difficult to
cross from one side of the street to tha
other during the rainy season.
Tne same conditions prevail on First
and Seventh avenues. The people of
Richmond believe they have some rights
in the premises, and they will endeavor to
enforce them by an appeal to the Board ol
Supervisors.
They claim that the several franchises
were granted under the express condi
tions that a regular service should be
maintained. The partly covered tracks
bear eloquent testimony to the fact that
it is not now, nor has it been done for
years. The Market-street Company has a
way of reclaiming old franchises, should
the occasion demand it. The Richmond
people propose to thwart this by haying
the franchises forfeited or the conditions
complied with. .

it was a simple wedding, but the very ab- j
pence of all ostentation made the cere
mony all the more impressive. The en
tire ground floor of the I>e Young resi
dence was placed at the disposal of the
wedding guests and lavishly yet artistic
ally decorated with flowers.
In the drawing-room a bower of Q-lazen
wood Beauty roses was erected from which
dangled numberless tiny wedding bells, i
The bower was triangular and novel in
shape, and the effect of the whole was one
of surpassing beauty. At noon the bridal
party entered, keeping time to the bridal
cborus from "Lohengrin" chanted by seven
young ladies.
First came the maid of honor, Miss Ida
Callaghan, followed immediately by the
fair young bride leaning on the arm of her i
uncle, If. H. de Young.
The groom and his beet man, George
Heazelton, met the bridal party at the im
provised altar, where Archbishop Riardon
read the ceremony which made Belle Cohn
and Krnest Brandt husband and wife. After
the ceremony a wedding breakfast was
served in the ballroom. The tables were
all decorated with orange blossoms and
covers were laid for one hundred.
The bride wore a handsome white satin
pown. Thejupe was made full and flow
ing, and the corsage trimmed with lace
appliqued in chiffon over the satin. A bridal
veil fastened to the coiffure by a wreath of
orsnee blossoms completed the handsome
toilet.
ttiat IaÂ« Callaehan. the maid of honor, wore
ling gowii of yellow taffeta, pompadour
Bilk.
Mrs. deYonnc was attired in a magnificent
ParU gown of black lace over a green silk foun
dation.
Mist Mamie Dean wore a modish eown, the
jupeofwhii-h was fashioned of white moire,
and the corsage of white chiffon and pompa
dour ribbons.
The fair bride of yesterday is one of the most
charmine young women in society. She is tal
ented and accomplished, and greatly admired
in her particular circle.
Mr. Brandt is a young En^lishrAn, the resi
dent representative of a rich Enliish mining
syndicate. During his short resittnee in this

recognize his superior aptitude. He is a

AN ANGRY DRESSMAKER
Mrs. Jane de Boucher Arrested for
Obtaining Money by False Pre
tenses.
Mrs. Jane de Boucher, who conducts a
school of dressmaking at 121 Post street,
was arrested on a warrant yesterday after
noon charging her with obtaining money
by false pretenses.
The complaining witness is Miss Nellie
Sorgenfrey, who claims that she paid Mrs.
de Boucher $70 to teach her the art of
dressmaking. After a few days she be
came dissatisfied with her teacher and de
manded the return of the $70, which she
alleged Mrs. de Boucher refused to do.
Mrs. de Boucher was indignant over her
arrest. She showed a receipt from Miss
Sorgenfrey for $40 of the amount and said
she had returned her other small sums.
She denied owing the young lady any
thing.
"It is nothing but a blackmailing
scneme." said Mrs. de Boucher. "There
was no need for me to practice dishonesty,
as my husband and I are worth $150,000.
I don't see why I should be detained here,
as it is an outrage. I have several en
gagements this afternoon and must keep
them." She was released on $300 bonds.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 30, 1896.
HARD DAY OH THE TALENT
Reversals of Form and Numer
ous Upsets Kept the Crowd
Guessing.
FIVE FAVORITES WEEE BEATEN
Crescendo Beaten in a Drive by Ca
brillo â Greyhurst Took a
$noo Stake Event.
The California Jockey Club certainly
gave racegoers the worth of their coin
yesterday. Eight events at various dis
tances were down for decision, and it was
with a sigh ot relief, thankful, no doubt,
that they were alive, that the crowd
started for home at the conclusion of the
day's entertainment. It was the last day
of the Bay District's two weeks' meeting,
and the revelations of the "dope" book
were set at defiance. Horses that in the
past have been dead, or existing merely
in a comatose condition, suddenly came to
life, while others ran as though fit sub
jects for the Coroner. Three winning
favorites out of eieht easily explains the
cause of the speculating fraternity's down
fall.
One of the most unexpected dumps of
the day was the defeat of Crescendo in the
mile and a furlong handicap, with but six
starters. The big chestnut was exten
sively supported at odds of 4 to 5 and even
money, and had to acknowledge defeat at
the hands of R. Van Brunt's uncertain
performer, Cabrillo, with odds of 7 to 1
about him in the ring.
The outsider was the pacemaker through
out the running, trailed by the favorite,
and although hard, ridden through the
stretch Crescendo nad to bow to the in
evitable by half a length at the wire. The
winner's time for the distance was I:55J^.
The 4to 1 second choice, Wheel of For
tune, with Marty Bergen in the saddle,
came from the far rear the last three fur
longs, finishing a good third.
The Bay District handicap for two-year
olds, at six furlongs, drew out seven
youngsters and proved a gift for the El
Primero stable's pair, Greyhurst and
Fleur de Lis, who ran one, two. Four to
five was the general price laid against the
duo. Tae stable wanted to win with Grey
hurst, and his stable companion traveled
under "wraps." The gray shook Dolce
off alter a quarter had been covered and
passed the wire, ridden out, three parts of
a length before Fleur de Lis in 1:15%.
Hohenzollern, one of the lightweights of
the party, was a close third.
Dr. itowell's recent purchase, Claude
Hill, romped in the easiest of winners in
the opening five and a half furlong scram
ble, with twelve starters, at odds of 6 to 1.
Isabelle took the place, something over a
length ahead of "ireka. Myron at 1% to 1
ruled favorite in the betting".
A mile run under selling conditions that
followed furnished an opportunity for
Jack Richelieu to win a purse. The old
horse held sway in the betting at odds of
8 to 5, and heading his field before striking
the stretch, passed the wire an easy win
ner, in 1:44. Imp. Fullerton Lass took
the place from Polaski in a drive.
Fourteen cheap-selling platers started in
the third event at five and a half furlongs.
Tiie winner turned up in Ruinart, backed
down from 25 to 8 to 1, ridden by Marty
Bergen. Favory, al2to 1 shot, finished in
the place. Nic Nac, the 9to 5 choice, was
unplaced.
Another mile run that followed the two
year-old stake put one more crimp in the
talent. Rebellion, who was third to
Heartsease and Senator Bland on the pre
vious day, took the lead below the furlong
pole from home and won like a veritable
stake horse. Miss Ruth, an outsider, was
second, with the favorite Long Lady third.
The winner went to the pos: 4 to 1 in the
books.
Tim Murphy carried the shekels in the
seventh race, over six furlongs, starting a
6to 5 chance. He showed the way into
the stretch and then faded away to noth
ing. Sea Spray then passed Elmer F, who
had been running in second place, and
beat him out a length. The ring laid sto
1 against ihe winner.
The Burns & Waterhouse entry, Good
win 11, starting at odds of 7 to 5, won the
concluding five and a half furlong scramble,
ridden out, a length before Wandering
Nun.

becoming shop-worn and musty. Not that;
officials in the stand were not vigilant in
the exercise of their duties, but they were
combating against influences over which
they had no control. Ingleside has been
noted since its opening for clean and hon
est, sport, and its management will en
deavor to keep it up to a high standard of
excellence during the present meeting.
As formerly the occasion of the opening
will be ladies' day. The card is a good
one and the "regulars" will no doubt be
out in full force.
The California Jockey Club has offered
a reward of $500 for the detection of the
person or persons implicated in the De
cision and Marjorie affairs. A noted
astronomer once endeavored to discover
whether or not the man in the moon wore
whiskers. It is to be hoped the culprits
will be brought to justice.
Ruinart and Road Warmer have been
matched under the same weights and con
ditions as carried in yesterday's race and
over the same distance for $500 a side.
The owners of each horse posted a forfeit of
$200 last evening.
Bozeman was set down for fifteen days
for a ride on Mirambo that did not suit
the judges.
The showing made by Cabrillo was a
marked improvement over his race on
April 25, and Trainer Murry was asked
for an explanation.
Murry said that on that occasion the
horse was started against his approval ;
that yesterday he told Owner Van Brunt
to give the jockey the instructions him
self, and that he personally did not bet a
cent on the racer, but played Crescendo.
Mr. Van Brunt backed his horse, however,
showing conclusively that it is not always
the trainer that is the wisest.
What a world of good Tuesday's race did
Rebellion. Yesterday he ran like a stake
horse.
Crescendo pulled up lame at the conclu
sion of his race and It was though the had
broken down. About a furlong from the
wire he was struck on the nigh fore ankle
by Cabrillo, and on examination later by
a veterinary showed that the injury was
only trifling.
Jockey Shaw, who was set down at the
last Ingleside meeting for a ride on Gold
Bug that did not suit Judge Murphy,should
be given another trial. It is not always the
"kick" of a disgruntled member of the
bookmaking fraternity that constitutes a
poor ride.
Marty Bergen put up about as poor a
ride on Wheel of Fortune as that good
mare has ever had. Four miles and she
might have been in it.
PATROLMEN PUNISHED.
One Is Dismissed From the Force and
Two Others Are Heavily
Fined.
The Police Commissioners 'had four
patrolmen before them last night on vari
ous charges.
Joel L. Stoddard and William Doran
were charged by Captain Gillen and Lieu*
tenant Bnrke with being in a saloon on
the Ingleside road for twenty-five minutes
while on duty. The charge was sustained,
and Stoddard was dismissed from the
force, and Doran \va3 fined $50. Stoddard
is the policeman who gave evidence in the
Ingleside holdup case as to picking up
Middlemiss, one of the defendants, who
was drunk, and riding downtown with
him on an electric car.
This was the third time since then that
Stoddard had been up before the Commis
sioners.
Cornelius Rial was chareed by Captain
Spillane with failing to report at a fire and
with being under the influence of liquor.
It being the first offense he was let off
with a fine ot $100.
A charee of unoflieerlike conduct pre
ferred by Fred Junker, a butcher, against
Herbert D. Mathewson, was dismissed.
A WELL-FILLED HOUSE.
The Girls' Union Benefit at Golden Gate
Hall a Success.
The grand concert for the benefit of the
San Francisco liirls' Union, given at Gol
den Gate Hall last evening, was well at
tended, both the main floor and the gal
lery being crowded.
The programme prepared for the occa
sion was such as to elicit generous applause
from the audience, the majority of the
performers being encored. It was as fol
lows :

WANT EUREKA'S TRADE.
T. H. Selvage on the Struggles
Oregon Merchants Are
Making.
OVERDUE TERMINAL RATES.
The Controlling Ambition of the Peo
ple of Humboldt Is, He Says,
for a Railroad.
T. H. Selvage, ex-District Attorney of
Humboldt County and grand councilor
of the order of Chosen Frienda of Cali
fornia, is a recent arrival here.
in speaking of the general conditions of
the northern part of tne State, Mr. Selvage
said: ' .
"I have resided in Hnmboldt County
siDce my boyhood and have a very warm
regard for its people and a deep interest in
its future prosperity. I know of no place
where the man with moderate means can
better secure for himself a home from
which he can abundantly provide for his
family all the necessaries of life.
"Our fruit and dairy lands are exten
sive and very productive and only need
the energy and labor of the small farmer
to make our county one of the richest in
the State. It iB true we are somewhat
isolated and cannot easily reach railroad
centers by land, but we have an excellent
steamship service between this City and
Eureka. On the steamship Pomona one
can make the trip between the two ports
in seventeen hours.
( J"Our mail service by steamship is good,
but by land it is inexcusably bad. The
Call by the overland mail reaches us at
any time within one month after it leaves
the press.
"There has been considerable discussion
between our people and the merchants of
San Francisco of late over our trade rela
tions. Portland is reaching out for busi
ness alone the northern coast, and has
extended its trade as far south as Eureka.
Its merchants have secured considerable
business with our people. Our Chamber
of Commerce has taken an active interest
in promoting these trade relations. The
reason for this action is not, as some peo
ple think, inspired by an unkind feeling
for San Francisco or her people. The
trade with Portland is favored, in order to
provoke competition between the trans
portation companies, that we may secure
terminal rates from our port to inland and
Eastern markets.
"At the present time we are unable to
ship our lumber products to the interior
and Eastern markets because of the high
rates of transportation from our port to
railroad communication with the East.
Terminal rates for Humboidt Bay either
by way of San Francisco or of Portland
would secure to us the same advantages
in the cost of transportation of products
as is now enjoyea by those cities.
"We must have terminal rates from one
way or the other. The direction from
which it comes will of course secure our
trade.
"A transcontinental railway with a
â¢western terminus at Eureka would bring
about the same results we are now looking
for in the direction I have mentioned.
Such a railway is of course the great and
controlling ambition of our people.
"With the improved condition of our
bar and harbor resulting from the expen
sive and successful work now being done
by the Government we will have a harbor
second to San Francisco. The asser
tion was made editorially in TpE Call re
cently that such a railroad meant connect
ing steamers direct to the Orient and that
such an accomplishment presented grave
questions for San Francisco. 1 believe,
however, that there never can be any seri
ous rivalry between this City and Eureka
resulting from such a road, as no trans
continental road will ever make Eureka
its sole terminus, leaving the great Sacra
mento Valley and San Francisco trade to
other lines. I have heard it said that San
Francisco needs a competing railroad.
The transcontinental road that has for its
western termini San Francisco and Eureka
will be a blessing to the whole coast and a
mutual advantage to both ports."
AN INSOLVENT ESTATE.
Mrs. Julia Fratinger Wants to Settle for
Twenty-Five Cents on the
Dollar.
Julia Fratinger has filed an account of
her husband's estate, and it tells a tale of
insolvency. A. M. Fratinger, the deceased,
was a well-known cloakmaker of this City
and when he died, about two years ago,
it was known that his estate was insolvent.
The store and fixtures were valued at
$30,000, there was $4900 in cash and book ac
counts and real estate enough to make a to
tal of $48,771. All that could be got for the
proDerty, however, was $15,454, and now
Mrs. Fratinger wants to settle at 25 cents
on the dollar. There are claims against
the estate amounting to $55,389.
The principal creditors are : Reiss Broth
ers $1455, London and San Francisco Bank
$2777, Stein, Simon & Co. $1304 Levi
Htrauss & Co. $2366, Kahn Brothers &
Klein $1479, Neuberger & Reiss $2052.
An Arctic owl. measuring a little more
than three feet from tip to tip of its wings,
was shot on one of the islands in the
harbor of Portland, Me., a few days ago.

Dear Sirsâ After using tobacco nearly twenty-
â¢even years I took: two and one half boxes of
your No-To-Bac, which freed me of the pernicious
habit, and have not tasted tobacco since, neither
have I any desire for it. I had previously tried a
number of antidotes, but without success, borne
months ago I procured three boxes for the Hon. C.
H. -Ellington, of this place, late State Senator and
I now President of the Farmers' State Alliance of

I thirty years. He used two box's of No-To-Bac and
Immediately discontinued the use 'of â¢ tobacco.

; It all rests with you. ? Why not try No-To-Bac
under absolute guarantee of cure by your own

ing new manhood, you can learn tobacco using -

NEW lORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V., April 29.â This was an
other dull day at the stock Exchange. The trans
actions aggregated only 127.700 shares. In the
early trading a higher ranse of , prices prevailed in
sympathy with reports from London of a firm
market for securities there. The advance was
equal to V2@T-8 er cent in the eeneral list, the
latter in Chicago Gas, while Consolidated - Gas
moved up from 163 10 1643^, the highest figure
yet attained. There was a fair demand for inter
national stock! on London account. The reaction
in the price ot refined sugars, however, and ad
vices from Germany that the Keicbstag would
probably pass the sugar bounty bill, led to a de
cline in sugar trust stock from 124Vb to 122% and
this weakened the whole market â 
A report that the American Tobacco trust would
be enjoined troni paying the scrip dividend re
cently declared led to a decline in that stock from
7214 to 7<Â»V 2 . but a recovery to7iy a subsequently
took 1 lace. The net losses In the general run of
stocks were only y 8 to \' 2 per cent and according
to statements made by leading commission houses
the selling had no special significance. Specula
tion closed about steady in tone despite rumors,
which were partly confirmed at the sub-treasury,
that between $1,500,000 and 92,000,000 in gold
will bÂ«! shipped to Europe on Saturday's steamers.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., April 29. â Changing from
May to July, with some little scalping by local
traders, made up the bulk of the business inthe
wheat market to-day. The buying of the near and
selling of later months about " balanced each other
and served to hold prices at fairly steady figures
during the morning. First quotations were better
than the final ones of yesterday, and subsequently
the gain was well preserved Showers were pre
dicted for Northwestern points, to which was
: ascribed the opening firmness. Liverpool cables
were a little stronger, and that, too, helped prices
i considerably. â  â¢
Receipts in the Northwest were 807 cars, against
361 last Wednesday and 413 a year ago. Chicago
received thirteen cars and inspected out 29,750
bushels. Export clearances amounted to 62,544
bushels. Closing Continental cables were irregular.
After noon a break took p ace, the reason for
which lay in the Agricultural Bureau's report on
foreign crops. With a few minor exceptions the
outlook was said to be. unusually promising. The
same report stated that -Argentina would have
from 80,000.000 to 35,000,000 bushels available
for export, instead of 15,000,000 bushels as was
estimated previously. July wheat opened from
64i/fe@64i4c, sold between 64y 2 c and 63% c, clos
ing at 63%@63%c, yÂ±c under yesterday. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow seventeen cars.
CORNâ Obtained material aid from the strength
of wheat. There was nothing else on which to
base the foundation for improvement. The re
ceipts were 194 cars, and 150.998 bushels were
withdrawn from store. Liverpool cables were
steady. but quiet. Business was extremely dull
and no evidence of activity was presented. Prices
declined when wheat broke and all appearance of
firmness disappeared. Export clearances amounted
to 228,859 bushels. July corn opened at SOS/gc,
sold between 30%Â®306/8C and SOy^c, closing at
the inside, i- c under yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow, 301 cars.
OATSâ Were steady. Business was of such a
small volume that there was neither buying force
nor selling pressure to cause essential alterations
of quotations. Receipts were 162 cars and 39.187
bushels wÂ«-re taken from store. The later easier
ton*Â» of surrounding markets had its effect on oats.
July oats closed a shade lower. Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow 200 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash. 91ViÂ®91VÂ«c; May,
87y 2 @873,ic: July. 90c bid, 90% c asked; Septem
ber, 921 Receipts were 16 cars.
PKOViSIONSâ Hogs were quoted irregular this
morning and product opened steady, not adopting
either strength or weakness from the yards mar
ket.. Some transferring of trade from near to dis
tant deliveries took place, an I that went to make
up the bulk of the trading. Like everything else
on the floor provisions displayed weakness late in
the session. Estimated stocks of provisions in
Chicago on May 1, as given by G. W. I'hilllDS Jr.,
will be: Pork, 150,001) barrels: lard, 170,000
'tierces, and ribs, 37.000,000 pounds. July pork
closed "V2C lower; July lard unchanged and July
ribs 5c lower.

CONDITIONS IMPROVING.
Trade Seems to Be Shaping Better In
I '\f. 'â 'â â  the East.
Henry Clews, the New York banker, gives the
following encouraging report of trade: "Gold ex
ports are much smaller than expected, and the
outward movement usual at this season seems
likely to be small. The reasons simply are that
the trade balance is running much more favorably
than a year ago, for exports are increasing and
imports diminishing, while our Indebtedness
abroad has already been reduced to a minimum.
Should the present efforts of the international
bankers toward creating a better feeling respect
ing American securities prove successful that, too,
will have a favorable bearing on the exchange
market, provided London buys our stocks and
bonds with more freedom, as now seems the dis
position.
"The treasury reserve is already very high: so
that the prospects of smaller gold exports than
last year relegat â  all doubts on that score to the
distant future. Railroad affairs generally are in
more satisfactory shape. Reorganization matters
are making satisfactory progress, and favor
able developments in this ' direction are
not improbable. Railroad earnings in March
were somewhat disappointing; but some
improvement may be looked for t even if
trade shows only a partial revival: and as the corn
crop is finally beginning to move that must inevi
tably increase future earnings. The easier rates
for money and belter market for commercial
paper are also Indications of the general improve
ment upon which the present rise in stocks Is
based."
MEETING OF FRUIT MEN.
The San Francisco Fruit Exchange announces
that "a general meeting will be held at the ex
change on Friday, May 1. at 5 p. . if., when im
portant correspondence from Eastern dealers and
California growers will be read, touching the inter
est of every dealer or handler of fruit. It is hoped
that dealers will make it convenient to be present."

there are now some grades of Newcastle very
scarce here, which are being replaced by British
Columbian steam Coals at full figures. There are
in all about 90,000 tons capacity already engaged
to load Coal in Australia for here; 80% of this
amount has not' yet been loaded, and some of the
ships already listed will not be at their loading
port for several months yet. - Values have changed
but little since the last mail; freight rates on Coal
are reported a little easier, hence asking prices for
cargoes are somewhat lower. Cabled reports are
that the miners have gone out of some of the prin
cipal collieries, but as yet no details have been re
ceived; as tbere is a very large amount of tonnage
awaiting Coal the workmen will probably succeed
in their demands. This strike has been threaten
ing for several months. The final outcome will be
a probable advance in the price of Coals."

DU MAURIER AND MOSCHELES.
The First Meeting of the Two Artists
in Gay Bohemia.
We first met in Antwerp in the class
rooms of the famous academy. I was
painting and blaguing, as one blagues in
the storm-and-stress period of one's artis
tic development. It bad been my good
fortune to begin my studies in Paris,
where, in the Atelier Gleyre, I had culti
vated the essentially French art of chaf
fing, known by the name of "la blague
parisienne," and I now was able to give
my less lively Flemish friends and fellow
students the fuil benefit of my experience.
Many pleasant recollections bound me to
Paris, so when I heard one day that a
"nouveuu" had arrived straight from my
old Atelier Gleyre I was not a little im
patient to make his acquaintanc.
The newcomer was Dv Maurier. I
sought him out, and, taking it for granted
that he was a Frenchman, I addressed him
in French. We were soon engaged in
lively conversation, asking and answering
questions about comrades in Paris, and
sorting the threads that associated us both
with the same place. "Did you know un
nomrae Poynter?" he asked, exquisitely
Frenchifying the name for my benefit. I
mentally translated this into equally ex
quisite English, my version naturally
being "a man called Poynter." Later on
an American came up, with whom I ex
changed a few words in bis and my native
tongue. "What the deuce are you? Eng
lish?" broke in Dv Maurier. "And what
the deuce are you?" I rejoined. And we
then and there made friends on a sound
international basis.
It seemed to me that at this first meet
ing Dv Maurier took me in at a glance â
the eager, hungry glance oi the caricatur
ist. He seemed struck with my appear
ance, as well he might be. I wore a work
man's blouse that had gradually taken its
color from its surroundings. To protect
myself from the indiscretions of my com
rades I had painted various warnings on
my back, as, for instance, "Bill-stickers,
beware!" "It is forbidden to shoot rub
bish here," and the like. My very black
hair, ever inclined to run riot, was encir
cled by a craftily conceived band of cro
chet work, such as only a fond mother's
hand could devise, ana I was doubtless
coloring some meerschaum of eccentric
design.
It has always been a source of legitimate
pride to mo to think that I should have
been the tool selected by Providence to
sharpen Dta Manner's pencil. There must
havebeen something in my "verfiuchte
physiognomic," asavery handsome young
German whom I used to chaff unmerci
fully called it, to reveal to Dv Maurier
those dormant capacities which had been
betrayed in his eager glance.â May Cen

THE STOCK MARKET.
The feeling was rather firm than otherwise yes
terday, but fluctuations were not wide. \
-; Business on the Bond | Exchange was excellent.
Capital seems to be flowing into the | local securi
ties at ,an unusual rate. San Francisco has been
behind the h ast for many years in speculation in
corporation shares, but It is coming to the front in
earnest now. jjj ' riS-'/ 'â¢' â  '.-'â '-
The Hollands Orange Grove and Water Com
pany - has declared a dividend of 6 per cent,
amounting to f 18,000.
The Calumet and Hecla Copper Mining Company
of Michigan has declared a divldt nd |of $5 per
share, or $500,000, payable May 15. Thi3 will
moke $45,350,000 in dividends to that date.
.The Ontario Mining Company of Utah will pay
its fourth monthly dividend of 10 cents per share
this year on April 30. '
At the delinquent assessment sale of the Con
solidated California and Virginia Mining Company
2800 shares of capital stock, on which the assess
ment was unpaid, were sold.
The last of a few seats offered for sale by the
San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange at $2000
each has been bought by M. H. Grossmeyer, who
hag been elected a member of the exchange. j Mr.
Urossmeyer ' was one of the charter members of
the exchange, but sold his seat â â  one year ago.
There are now thirty members. This is the limit,
and no more seats will be sold unless one of the
thirty wishes to retire. The local stocK and bond
business has improved immensely of late.
1 hree bars of Con. Cal. & Va. bullion, represent
ing the first shipment on the present run of the
Morgan mill upon ore from the mine, have an as
say valuation of 815,446 16, against a valuation of
$11,029 26 for the first three bars shipped during
the previous run. .

HUMANE SOCIETY'S REFORM.
Poun master Wcifzel Does Not See
Why His 0 fice Should Be
Regarded With Contempt.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 29. f
The Humane Society has decided to
have a model pound. The pound of to-day
is not the pound that was conducted by
"Baby" O'Connell a few years ago, but
neither is the humane institution that the
society and the present Toundmaster wish
it to be.
Herbert 1.. Weitzel. Oakland's pound
master who works under the auspices of
the Alameda County Humane Society, has
an idea that there is no reason why a pub
lic pound should be a public nuisance. He
also does not see why a public Poundman
should be regarded as a common enemy.
He thinks there must be a perfect
method of conducting pounds, and has
determined if possible to find out how to
go about it.
He has sent the following letter to the
Poundmasters of about thirty cities:
To the Poundmafitrr: I am collecting data for
publication concerning the public pounds of
the various large cities of the country, and
will appreciate it if you will kindly give me
some of the facts with regard to that of your
city.
For convenience I will inclose a list of ques
tions on which I would like to be informed,
and if I may tax your courtesy for that and
any other items of interest concerning the
same It will be greatly appreciated, not only
by myself, but by the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals, for it is in the in
terest of the socleiy lhat I am working. Very
respectfully, H. Weitzel. '
The questions covering all the points of
interest to a Poundmanare:
Is the pound conducted under the auspices
of the Humane Society? How many deputies
do you employ? Is your otlice remunerated
by salaries or fees? How inaay wagons and
horses do you employ? What 'is the average
number of dogs and head of stock impounded
per month? About what per ceut of dogs are
either redeemed or sold? \vhai is your method
of catching dogs and of killing them? What is
the average expense per month of running the
pound? Can you send me a copy of that sec
tion of the city ordinance which relates to the
pound?
"I take a pride and interest in the
pound," said Mr. Weitzel, "and I do not
see why so humane an office should be so
generally treated with scorn. We have
made great improvements in this city
since the society took charge of the ponnd,
and with the assistance given by Dr. Car
-1 enter we have done a great deal of hu
mane work. But I want to have a model
pound, and that is the purpose 1 have in
view."
SETTING OUT THE FACTS
Alameda's Delegates State Their
Care to the Whole Dis
trict Delegation.
Askd Not to Take Any Action Till
TVs C unty\s Contest Has
B;en Considered.
Oakland Office Bah Francisco Call,}
003 Broadway, April 29. )
.E. A. yon Schmidt, chairman of the
Alameda County delegates who were j
elected at primaries, sent a copy of the fol
lowing letter to-day to all the delegates of ,
E. A. yon Schmidt, Chairman of the
Republican Primary Delegation-
the Third Concressional District Conven
tion :
To the Delegate! to the Third Cong rational
'republican Conventionâ Gentlemen: The dele
pates elected to represent the Republicans of
the county of Alameda in the Third Congres
sional Republican Convention respectfully
call your attention to the following facts:
Firstâ The calls of the National and State
Republican commit provide that delegates
to the different Congressional conventions
thfill be "selected in the Fame manner as the
nomination of a representative In Congress is
made in such districts."
Secondâ lt has always been the custom in
the county of Alameda to elect delegates to
the Congressional convention by open pri
maries. â .::â¢â¢-
Thirdâ The members of the State Central
Committee, representing the Third Congres
sional District, refused to obey the directions
of the National and State Central committtes
and, instead of calling primaries in the county
of Alameda, appointed delegates to the Con
gressional convention.
Fourth l'lie Republicans of the county of
Alameda demandeJ that the State Committee
men from this county should cail primaries.
Their demand whs refused.
Fifthâ The Republicans of Alameda County
then requested the County Committeemen to
call primaries. This request was refused.
Sixthâ The Republican clubs of Alemeda
then took the matter in hand and appointed
members to represent them iv an executive
committee. This executive committee then
called primaries in strict conformity to the
calls 01 toe National and Slate committees.
The priniuries were held and 2000 Republi
can* voted at them. Tills vote Is greater thau
that cast at the Republican Congressional pri
maries four yenrs ago.
Seventhâ Tbe delegates elected at these pri
maries met in convention and elected dele
gates to represent the Republicans of the
county of Alameda in the Third Congressional
Convention.
Eighthâ These forty-seven delegates thus
chosen by the vote? of 2000 Republicans of
Aiameia County respectfully ask that you
favorably consider their request that you vote
to seat them in the Third Congressional Ke
publican Convention. And in support of their
request they point to the fact that they repre
sent 2000 Republican votes cast in open pri
maries. They also cull your attention to the
following words of Chairman Carter of the
National Republican Committee: â â¢
â¢â¢The call /or the National Convention re
quires that delegates from Congressional dis
tricts shall bo elected in the same manner as
candidates for Congress are nominated. If in
a given district the party candidate for Con
gress is nominated by committee, then it
would be proper to elect delegates to the
National Convention in the same way.' But in
all cases where candidates for Congress are
nominated at primaries or by elected delegates
in convention assembled, delegates to the Na
tional Convention should be selected in the
game manner."- . , â¢
Congressmen' have always been selected in
tne Tilrd Congressional District by a delega
tion elected by primaries in Alameda County.'
Believing that you are not in favor ot dis
franchising the Republicans of- Alameda
County and depriving them of a right to a
voice in the selection of a Republican nomi
nee for President of the United States, we ap
peal to you to aid the primary delegates from
thi* county in securing seats in the Third Con
gressional District and State conventions.
And we further respectfully request that
you take no part in the proceedings of any
convention of the Third Congressional District
until our delegation has been heard.
E. A. yon Schmidt.
DR. M'LEAN'S SUCCESSOR.
Rev. Charles X, Jefferson of Chelaea,
Mass., Declines the Call.
OAKLAND. Cal., April 29.â Rev.
Charles E. Jefferson of Chelsea, Mass., will
not, be Dr. McLean's successor.
A telegram was received from him to
night stating that he had concluded not to
resign from his present pastorate.
This leaves the First Congregational
Church where it was a year ago as regards
the appointment of a permanent pastor.
Several overtures have been made to
prominent Eastern divines, and it has
been stated that premature publication of
their plans has ended negotiations. There
are some members of the congregation
who t liink Rev. Jefferson never had any
intention of accepting tne Oakland ctiurch
and that he came out here at the church's
expense for the pleasure cf seeing Cali
fornia.
The trustees have almost decided to give
up seeking a permanent pastor and will
for a while employ temporary help. Rev.
J. Halleck is now in Oakland irom Ta
corua, which place he left a few weeks ago
on account of his health, and it is sup
posed that he is looking for another church
and would like a call to the Firat Congre
gational.
Altnough Mr. Jefferson's call was made
unanimous by the congregation there is
very little disappointment at his declina
tion.

A Kearny-Street Tailor Guilty of
Contempt of Courtâ Alameda's
Flora Fete.
ALAMEDA. Cal.. April 29.â The Re
corder's Court was crowded with witnesses
and other interested spectators this morn
ing when the case of The People va.
Joseph Emoric was called. Emeric was
charged with violating section 6 of ordi
nance 148, forbidding the keeping of places
where gambling may be carried on. The
City Attorney had personally laid tiie
complaint that on and prior to the 14th of
March Emeric had been conducting a
gambling-room at the rear of ZinggsÃros.'
tobacco-store, 1421 Park street, admission
to which was gained by key and by being
known to the keeper of the rooms. Coun
sel for the defense challenged the com
plaint on the ground that it was sworn to
on information and belief only. This the
people objected to, and after citing author
ities pro and con Bruner's motion was de
nied.
The plea of not guilty was then entered,
and a solemn stillness held possession of
the room. The City Attorney had a sheet
of foolscap covered with the names of wit
nesses, in all some sixty. Would they be
called on to testify ? They breethed freer
when counsel agreed to a statement of
facts, thus dispensing with their services,
and agreed to argue Dext Thursday week.
The case of the People versus Charles
Powell will not be heard until the case
against Enieric is disposed of. He is
charged with allowing draw poker and
pedro to be played for money.
New Klectric Light Company.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 29.â The names
of the Park-street merchants who, F. N.
Delanoy said yesterday, were deeply in
terested in the formation of this new'com
pany. have been made publicâ at least four
of the rive names have seen the light.
They are: Ex-TruÂ«tee Stanley Stephen
son, oil and color merchant; J. B. Vos
burg, hardware-dealer; C. F. Fischer,
plumber and pastitter, and Joseph \v!
Jackson, furniture-dealer. The city ofli
cial organ, speaking on the matter, "says:
'â¢If it is really proposed to eatabiish here a
private electric plant of the magnitude
and efficiency stated, the board will most
likely get embarrassed in its tight to keep
it out. For such a plant would be of much
more value to the public than tbe munici
pal plant, even after the people pay $2Â£,000
to expand it."
A prominent member of the Municipal
League said to-day that tbe league looks
on this legal squabbling and fighting for
injunctions and franchises as a means to
an end. It is all for the purpose of depre
ciating the plant in the eyes of the public,
so that the 'kickers" may subsequently
purchase it for themselves at a reduced
iieure. He also said he is willing to rind
a purchaser to-morrow for the city's plant
as it stands for $50,000, if the city is will
ing to sell it. and obtain his commission
from the purchaser. This, he contends,
disposes of any embarrassment and in
creased value to the public of a private
concern.

903 Broadway, April 29. j
The Fabiola Mayday festival opened to
night with a grand lantern bicycle parade.
An unusually large number of riders
turned out and the streets were lined with
spectators.
Every club in line had a desitrn of its
own and bunting and flowers were used
very prettily in a hund-ed different styles.
One of the most noticeable features of the
parade was the large number of tandems,
on many of which the leading figure was
the bloomer girl. The prettiest single
feature was the tandem ridden by E. Burt
Lund and his handsome wife. They
headed the Reliance Club ridera and the
decorations and the riders were cheered
along the line of march.

Charles Fair's horseless carriage also
joined the procession. A brass band in a
wagon headed the procession and the way

The bugle calls and yells of the different
clubs helped to increase the enthusiasm
and the great Fabioia fete could not have
been launched under more favorable con
ditions.

STUDENT SOLDIERS FIGHT
Effective Sham Battle and
Maneuvers on the
Campus.
Another Election for School and
Wharf Wantedâ A Novel Rifle
Shcot Arranged.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 29.â Despite
the heavy fall of rain last night and the
intermittent showers both this morning
and afternoon, the annual inspection of
the military department at the State Uni
versity took place to-day. Following was
the order in which the exercises of the
day were carried on:
Morningâ lnspection by Colonel George H.
Burton, inspector-general, Pacific District
United States army; artillery drillâ saber exer
cise; signal drill; concert by band of the Uni
versity Cadets.
Afternoonâ Review in honor of Colonel Bur
ton; battalion drill; extended order diill;
solution of a problem in minor tactics; com
pany drill.
The entire morning was Riven up to the
inspection of the battalion by Colonel
Burton of the United States army, and to
the artillery and signal drills. The maneu
verings were entireiy or a routine nature.
In the afternoon came the events of the
day â the battalion aud competitive com
petition drills and the sham battle. Swell
society people were out in groat numbers,
notwithstanding the fact that the rain
fell quite heavily at about 2 o'clock.
Lad es with spring bonnets and umbrellas
were very much in evidence.
The baseball grand stand, with a seating
capacity of 1000, was completely covered
with spectators, besides many who were
standing in groups here and there over
the grounds. After the battalion drill and
review in honor of Colonel Burton had
taken place, the two battalions, under the
command of Majors Thompson and Me-
Cullock, took their appointed place* in
preparation for the sham battle. The
first brigade, under. McCullock, was sta
tioned at the lower side of the campus,
near the cinder track, while Major
Thompson's men betook themselves to the
gently sloping hills, back of the main
buildings, and prepared themselves for an
onslaught, it being planned that they
should take the offensive.
Within a few minutes after the com
panies had been assigned to their stations,
the booming of the two steel-rifled can
nons on the west of the campus and the
successive cracks from the outposts and
sharpshooters announced that hostilities
had commenced. Out from their ambus
cade rame the second batallion, and by
stow platoon movements, wit > continued
firmer, the two contending armies moved
toward each other until within range, too
close apparently for the first battalion, and
in consequence they were forced to make a
retreat. The conquering army rushed at
their foe with fixed bayonets until their
colors were drawn down. Tne defeated
men attribute the loss of the day to the
lack of strength of the artillery detach
ment and the more commanding position
of the enemy.
The hospital corps were out with their
stretchers and painkillers. Their maneuv
ering, as well as the feigned exhaustion
and death of the brave young soldiers, was
a fruitful source of amusement for the spec
tators. Twice when they were hurrying off
the field with corpses on their stretchers
one of them dropped his end and the bodies
were allowed to roil over on the wet
ground. In one case the "corpse" was so
distrusted that he got up and walked off.
Following the sham battle was the
competitive company drill. This drill is
held each year, and the company making
the best showing from every military
point of view is honored during the suc
ceeding year by being permitted to carry
the colors. Last year Corat any B held
the honors. On account of the reports
for attendance not having been in/the de
cision as to which shall be the color com
pany for '96-97 was deferred. Lieutenant
Winan said this afternoon that Com
panies A B F and D did especially well.
Burned in Effigy.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 29.â This
afternoon, immediately after the comple
tion of the inspection and drill, the junior
class marched over the campus in a pro
cessional line bearing a stnffed dummy
symbolic of their military life, and after
observing the appropriate funeral rites
over the remains of the effigy they con
structed a pyre and burned it to ashes.
Rifle Shoot bj Telegraph.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 29 âA novelty
in university cadet competitive rifle shoot
ins will be introduced in the near future.
The Illinois University cadets have ac
cepted the challenge of the Berkeley
cudet rifle team to a competitive shoot, to
take place on May 11 by telegraph. Ten
men will be selected from each university
as competitors. The Berkeley men will
use the 200-yard range at Shell Mound
Park. Those who are to participate have
not yet been named.
*'151ue and Gold."
BERKELEY, Cal., April 29.â The first
invoice of the first edition of the new
Blue and Gold arrived this morning and
.'M) copies went off "like hot cakes."
At fir.-^t copies were sold at $1 a piece, but
later the price rose to $1 25. The volume
was well received, and it was thought that
the few ''shots" directed at the faculty
would not rankle to the extent of arousing
retaliation.

publican Club, has called a meeting for

HIS HEART IS UNTRUE
Captain John Curtis Is Sur
prised to Find That It Is
Migrating.
COMMENCED DURING THE WAR.
Strange Discovery of the Pension
Examiners While Rerating an
Old Soldier.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. April 29. \
, The local Board of Pension Examiners
were considerably surprised this afternoon
while examining Captain .John Curtis for
an increase of pension to find that his
heart had left its original and proper po
sition and was taking a journey over to the
right side of the man's body.
The board consists of three of the lead
ing Dhysicians of the city â Dr. J. R. Brad
way, Dr. W. A. Fine and Dr. H. S.
Rucker.
The candidate was a captain in the
Seventh Minnesota Infantry under Colo
nel W. R. Marshall, now Governor of the
State. In June, 1863, he had to tender his
resignation owing to lung trouble, which
resulted in the loss of his voice. At the
time he was ranking captain and would
have been promoted major in a short
time.
The captain has suffered all of the years
since from lung trouble and came to Cali
fornia to escape the hard winters of the
East. He lives in quiet with his only
daughter at 964 Eighth street, but is un
able to be out much owing to the condi
tion of his lungs. He has drawn a small
pension for some years, but owing to his
poor health decided to seek an increase, so
he went before the board for re-examina
tion.
Tlie result was as much a surprise to him
as to the examining physicians. In fact,
he doss not yet clearly understand what
they decided about his ca^e.
"About a year ago," said he in speaking
of the matter, "I began to have queer feel
ings about the heart at night. 1 also no
ticed that I could not sleep on my right
side and to get relief I would have to lie
on my back and get my head lower than
my body. Soon severe pains began in the
jugular veins on the left side of my neck;
later this went into my head. It has con
tinued coming and going at frequent in
tervals until at times I feel as if drunK. I
also have sick fainting spells come over
me as if I was dying. It only lasts a short
time, but is miserable for the time being.
"The doctor told me to-day that he
found my heart was not in place, but had
moved over to the right until it was about
there."
The speaker indicated a point about at
I the point of the breastbone. He declared
i he was 67 years of age and was going to
live fifteen years longer at the least calcu
lation, as there was nothing to prevent it.
Dr. Bradway saidtbat the examination
! showed that Curtis was absolutely unable
to do any labor and that his lungs were
badly affected. Regarding the heart he
said, "Dr. Rucker made the examination
i in our presence and we afterward talked
I the case over. He said the heart was
I slightly enlarged and seemed to be moved
| over to the right several inches. How
| ong it ha 3 been that way or whether it is
i growing to the right his examination
i would not show.
"There are authenticated cases of a
heart leaving its proper position and grow
ing over to the right side. They are rare,
! however, and naturally cause much|trouble
I to the owner. The usual cause for such
| peculiar conduct for an organ a3 well be
! liiaved as the heart generally is, is that the
j organs about it enlarge and crowd it to
one side. Outside of the inconvenience it
causes there is no real danger to the per
son."
BRIDGES ON BRIDGES.
A New Method Proposed of Settling
the Trouble of Crossing the
Estuary.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 29.â Colonel
Lyman Bridges has a new plan for set
tling the difficulty of bridging the estuary.
He has submitted his plans to thÂ« Board
of Trade, and when the new officers have
been inducted into office they will take the
matter up. His plan id as follows :
The all-Important thing to do is to build so
those who come after us will not have to undo
what we have done, ana now while some well
minded peonies who look only to this day's re
qnir ments are asking the good people of Oak
land and Alameila, or more properly speaking
Alameda County, to have but one combined
railroad and passenger bridge buiit with steep
approaches on either end, so that teams and
carriages can be dangerously accommodated
by a second story over the snorting steam
engine.
We tÃke the ground that some system or
plans fur the future as well as the present
should be considered und adopted. How does
Oakland ever expect to become the greater
Oakland with only one second-story bridge?
Will that help Rssimilnte the interests of Ala
meda with Oakland? No. There should be a
biiihrent Mnrket street, Broadway, Oak and
Clinton streets, and the Wtbster-strcet bridge
removed. How can this be accomplished?
First, let the crossing of the estuary
\ at Broadway be done by commencing at the
j south side of Third street ftnd build r stone
| viaduct with a roadway twenty leot in width,
having ten feet in widtn on each stdo of the
street for sidewalk and half of the balance of
the street on each side of the viaduct for street,
which for Broadway would be two thirty-foot
streets, which is entirely sufficient.
From the north side of Second street let
there be a entrance to Third street
' to a tunnel built in masonry for two blocks,
; with an easy grade, from Thirdstreet, under the
es'.uary through a 24-foot iron pipe connected
with the tunnels at either end. At the Ala
meda end of the tunnel as gradual or a more
easy grade can be made than on the Oakland
side. The drainage of the tunnel is a simple
matter and when this economical passage-way
for vehicles, local streetcars, etc., Is accom
plished, then give us another viaduct at Oak
street, another at Clinton street and another
j at Miirket street, and the Onklnnd water front
will be a reality. The citizens of both cities
can avail themselves of the large tracts of
valuable manufacturing and commercial loca
tions, now nnd permanently idle for their non
aecesÂ«ibiiity.
i The time must come wnen the immense ex
pense of idle and non-productive property on
either side of the estuary will be covered with
warehouses, shipyards and factories. Does
any stranger seeking a location have his con
fidence increased in any city that is begging
to have in six miles only one bridge across an
estuary of such importance to navigation and
traffic?
Let the Alice-street bridge be built ten feet
hieher than at present, and made for double
tracks with bom eauÂ«es; also provide for a
single-track bridge for Peralta street, when re
quired, and work to a broad gauge intelligent
standard that shows confidence of a great city
in the near future.

this sign hanging outside

new era of drug selling.
Is it any wonder that he
has to enlarge his quar-

busy, and that his store is
one of the most popular

You can afford to trade

THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME
TO CONSULT THE GREAT CLAIRVOYANT
AND MEDIUM PROF. F. EUGKNE.
1728 MARKET ST.
The professor during his long residence in *an
Francisco has met with unprecedented success,
He could refer you to people all over the world for
testimonials as to his worth, but li Is not neces-
sary to search the extremetles of the earth
when he can refer you to thousands in your midst
who have been made prosperous and happy
through his wise advice; ask your prosperous
neighbor who started him aright. " Investigate and
you will find that your business rival is one of his
many patrons.
'â Nothing succeeds like success," and if you
would be successful call on him without delay: it
costs practically nothing: sOc and $1, 60 c and $1,
50c , and $1. 50c and $1, COc and $1 is his price
at present, no more than you woula pay an un-
known clairvoyant or a partially developed
medium.
His readings astonish the most skeptical. All
are satiHbcd. The professor gives advice on all
matters that are of interest to humanity. . Busi-
ness, speculation. Investments, insurance, love,
courtship, marriage and divorce; settles lovers'
quarrels and causes speedy and happy marriages.
He locates mines and buried treasures, finds lost
or stolen pronerty, interprets dreams, cures bad
habits and destroys evil influences in half the
time required by the best of the other mediums.
Remember, there lire but few mediums in the
world that can work these wonders, and none out-
side of the eminent professor in San Francisco.
Remember PROF. EUGEXE'S communications
come direct from the Spirit World, hence his in-
ability to be mistaken In any matter.
Remember also that the Professor Is perma-
nently located in San Francisco: he Is here to stay.
Hours 10 a. m. to 8 P m. Letters containing
stamps answered. PROF. EUGENE,
728 Market st,
TARTLING! â - â 
BE ITCHING I BEWILDERING! ' ' " '
MARVELOUS!
Multitudes dally visit the sumptuous parlors of
PROFESSOR M. L. CARNELLE, 220 EDDY ST.
And why is It? The record made by this greatest
of mediums 7 years ago Is reproduced upon his re-
turn, and the grand truths he then expounded left
Indelible imprints on the minds of studious people.
During th- years of absence from our great city
the professor has visited every city of Importance,
and has been consulted by the most eminent ex-
ponents of every art and science. He at all times
invites- skeptics to call on nfm, and he will con-
vince them that he Is sincere and truthful In all
that he claims to do. The professor believes that
"Honesty is the best policy," nnd desires your con-
fidence on all matters incidental to humanity. If
your existence possesses the many intricacies
which need unraveling he is prepared to show
! you the way. If false friends surround or beset
j your path you will find his marvelous powers of
the utmost avail. His vast experience in giving
advice on business, mines, speculations of any
kind, games of chance, changes, lawsuits, wills,
old estates, lost or stolen property, interpreting
dreams, curing bad habi is, and guiding yon
from all troubles or dangers; also. Indispensable
advice on love, marriage and how to choose a
wife or husband for future happiness or success.
This, together with the work he performs in re-
uniting the separated, causing a speedy marriage
with the one you dearly love, healing family
troubles, removing evil "influences, etc., Is the
safest guarantee that he Is once and for all ihe
most brilliant medium and clairvoyant of modern
times. Thus it is that professional men . aud so-
ciety leader* seek his advice; thus it is that a
heavy mall is daily his. The grandest test of all
is to seek him personally and you will find him to
be the magnetic medium of the people. Letters
with stamps promptly answered. Hours, 9 to 9
daily and Sundays. *

DR. BROWN LAYS
DOWN HIS ARMS
His Resignation Is Ac
cepted by the First
Church.
A HYSTERICAL SESSION.
Mercy Prevailed Over a Dis
position to Expel the
Minister.
BOTH FACTIONS RELIEVED.
It Is Expected That the Late Pastor
Will Transfer His Labors to
lowa.
Charles Oliver Brown, D.D., be who was
unfrocked by the Bay Conference ten days
ago, is no longer a pastor. In fact, he is a
gentleman of leisure and Micawber-like is
waiting for something to turn up. He
tendered Ins resignation last night and it
was unanimously accepted.
This condition of affairs is due to a little
surprise which the reverend gentleman,
through the connivance of his stanch lieu
tenant, Deacon I. H. Morse, sprung at the
business meeting of the First Congrega
tional Church last night. Brown evidently
knew where he stood, for when the matter
of accepting his resignation was voted on
his friends, according to "Moderator"
Morse, came to his rescue by voting down
the proposition, the unfrocked minister
having twenty votes to spare.
It was apparently a well laid and neatly
planned scheme. Brown entered the lec
ture-room seemingly full of confidence,
though his face showed that tbe strain
was more than skin deep. After a song or
two Pastor Brown requested Deacon Morse
to take the chair. This gentleman made a
lew remarks covering Congregationalism
in general.
Then Brown sprung his littJe surprise.
He tendered his resignation. And in a
beautiful tearless tremor which he knows
so well how to introduce pleaded with his
people to accept it. But tbe people were
evidently posted. They wyuld have none
of it. Then Blown, with characteristic
graciousness, told his listeners that a way
had just r.onie to him out of the difficulty.
The Dubuque Association had offered him
â¢ place in the fold and all that he had to
do was to accept it. He stated further
that lie had all along been willing to ac
cede to the wishes of the church, but that
he had felt it to be his duty to stand by
those who had upheld him.
Then Brown told the people that He
would have resigned long ago but for the
fact that the senior deacon, I. H. Morse,
had urged him not to do so. He had
placed himself entirely in the hands of
this gentleman, believing then and now
that whatever he did was prompted by
the purest motives. Then Brown rhapso
dized a good deal, ending with an appar
ently fervent appeal that his resignation
be unanimously accepted.
Whether his talk had the desired effect
or Deacon Morse liad prearranged the
whole sequence of events is of course un
known, but anyway some 200 or 300 people
stood up, thus expressing their willing
ness to accede to the pastor's wish. When
the noes were called one or two of his
earnest lady admirers boldly stood up,
but when they found they were hopelessly
in the minority they flopped into their
seats with eyes brimming over.
Deacon Dexter at this juncture intro
duced a resolution, strongly censuring the
Bay Conference for its unwarranted act in
unfrocking Pastor Brown. Hardly had
the deacon finished reading the lengthy
document when the gentleman most in
terested sprang to his feet and offered a
eubstitute, the effect of which was that the
Bay Conference go over the whole ground
again. The resolution did not say that
the verdict of the conference was unjust,
but rather hasty, and for that reason the
matter should be taken up once more.
Included in this was a statement to the
effect that Brown had no way of making a
livelihood except in the ministry, and that
if he were relieved of the censure he would
have no difficulty in obtaining another
church.
This was a diplomatic, move on the part
of the reverend gentleman, for when Morse
put the motion hardly a score opposed it.
The parson's friends claimed the result
as a big victory, and after the adjourn
ment they gathered around him in great
numbers and mingled their tears with his
emiles. For the pastor smiles at all times,
whether in the agony of defeat or in the
triumph of victory.
Long before the opening hour great
crowds gathered at the Mason-street en
trance. At 7:30 o'clock Sexton Pike
opened the big gate ana a wild rush fol
lowed.
The crowd only got as far as the door,
however, for Brown had his guards on
hand to prevent any but cnurch members
from entering. Deacon Morse had ap
pointed several of his followers to stand
guard at the first and second doors.
Every person was requested to give his
name at the first door and at the
Becond entrance the man stood with the
cburch register containing the names ano
addresses of every member ol the con
eregation.
Last night's struggle practically ended
NEW TO-DAY. : *

FAC-SIMILE OF THE REV. DR. C. O. BROWN'S LETTER OF RESIGNATION.
[Reproduced ly "TAe Call" from a photograph of the original document.]
the conflict publicly carried on between
Brown and his floct for four months al
most without intermission. Convicted oy
the ecclesiastical council of conduct unbe
coming a gentleman and a minister; with
his word brought into serious disrepute,
Brown still continued the tight to the very
last ditchâ and fell.
Even the action of the Bay Conference
seemed not to have disturbed his moral
equanimity, but with an audacity worthy
of a better cause he defied his brethren to
do their worst.
The end for the First Church has come
at last, so far as Brown is concerned, but
what the future has in store for him is a
matter of deepest concern to his friends,
his family and himself.
DR. BROWN'S FAREWELL.
The Pastor Presents His Reslgna-
tlorr, Which Is Finally
Accepted.
Within the lecture-room an anxious
crowd of church members sat waiting to
see what was to befall their pastor. Not
all the faces were friendly ones; but most
of them were hard to read. Blank ex
pectancy appeared to be the prevailing
expression.
Before the meeting opened the pastor
and his wife, Deacon Morse and Attorney
Nagle s-at speaking in whispers, while near
by was Mrs. Cooper without her daughter,
who had not been allowed to enter, not
being a member of the church.
At half-past seven Dr. Brown took his
place on the platform and announced the
hymn "Sweet Hour of Prayer," which was
sung by the congregation, after which the
psalm, "The Lord is my Shepherd," was
read responsively. The hymn, "Nearer,
my God, to Thee," brought the devotional
exercises to a close.
Dr. Brown then asked Deacon Morse to
take the chair.
The deacon gave a brief outline oi the
difficulties through which tne church had
passed and was rather severe in his refer
ences to the opposition. He assured the
pastor that the best wishes of tne congre
gation would follow him wherever he
mieht go aud under all circumstances.
"I do not wish to be the occasion of any
division in the church," answered Dr.
Brown, "and I am willing to make any
sacrifice rather than be instrumental in
bringing about such a state of things.
Throughout the course of the sad affair
which has tried us so severely I nave
acted under the advice of the senior
deacons and best members of this church.
"Had I been pressed to do so, I would
have resigned at any time. It must not
be imagined that I was altogether without
friends. Happily, an avenue of escape
was always open to me.
"Now, in view of the present feeling
among certain members of this congrega
tion, I present my resignation, with the
request that it be accepted."
Then, in the pathetic tone which he
knows so well how to use, Dr. Brown read
his resignation, which was as follows:
San Francisco, April 29, 1896.
To the First Congregational Church, San Fran
cisco, CaliJ orjnaâ L>eae Brethren : 1 herewith
tender my resignation as your pastor, and ask
that you will kindly act upon this communi
cation this evening. We have wrougnt to
gether in the bonds of the noblest fellowship
on earth.
For nearly four years I have been your pas
tor. For every act of Christian love "and fidel
ity, for your co-operation in labor for our Lord,
for your sympathy, so abundantly expressed
in hours of deep trial, you have my lasting
gratitude. I shall ever pray God to bless this
dear church with the tokens of his divine
presence and infinite love.
In the bonds of our common faith. Your
pastor, Charles O. Beown.
Some of the women wept aloud, while a
few of the men got out their handker
chiefs.
The pastor's voice shook as he com
menced reading and toward the middle of
the document became husky. Passing his
hand quickly across his eyes, with an evi
dent effort he cleared his throat and read
the resignation through to the end with
out again faltering.
â²mid much confusion the vote was
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 30, 1896.
taken. It was against the acceptance
of the resignation.
"Jb'riends," called out the pastor in a
clear, incisive tone, "I wish the resigna
tion to be accepted."
Another ballot ana yet another were
cast, and still the desired result was not
not obtained.
"Brethren," said Dr. Brown once more,
"I insist upon the acceptance of my resig
nation."
A last vote was taken and the resigna
tion accepted by a small majority.
Dr. Brown then read the following dis
patch:
Dubuqtie, lowa, April 28, 1896.
Dr. C. 0. Brown, 170S Geary street, San Fran
cisco, Cat.: Dubuque association has unani
mously adopted strong .resolutions protesting
against action of Bay Association and assuring
you of confidence and welcome to its fellow
ship, j. T. Adams.
Deacon Dexter moved that the meeting
go on record as protesting against the
sentence of suspension passed by the Bay
Conference, as illegal and invalid.
Dr. Brown offered an amendment to the
effect that the Bay Conference be asked to
reconsider its verdict.
When the final vote was taken, which
resulted in the congregation, by a voice of
3to 1, asking the Bay Conference to re
verse its action, the anti-Brown members
left the room.
Then the 3cene which followed was re
markable. Dr. Brown, raising his hand,
said:
"This is perhaps the last time that I
will address you from this platform.
"The time has come for me to ciose, and
I want to say now that I entertain for all
of you a sincere feeling of Christian love
and charity. Whatever I may have said
to cause pain I now sincerely ask for for
giveness.
"Now one more word. As you love me
let me ask you to loyally sustain this
church. Let none of the scenes or feel
ings of the past cause you to waver in
your earnest and loyal support of the
church.
"I wish I could mention yon all by
name â you who have stood by me in my
hours of trial and suffering. I cannot
close without referring to the constant
and unfailing Christian support I have re
ceived from Deacon Morse. Indeed, he
has been to me a Brother Jonathan."
Here Dr. Brown faltered in speech and
took hold of a chair for support. With
language broken by sobs he asked the Rev.
Mr. Wiliey to lead in prayer. "Will you
pray, Brother Wiliey?" he said. By this
time half the congregation was in tears.
Mr. Willey prayed for divine consola
tion for the church, the pastor and the
wife of the pastor.
Dr. Brown recovered his composure
while Deacon Willey was engaged in
prayer, and at the close of the petition the
pastor said :
"I wanted to mention Mr. Nagle, Deacon
Morse and Deacon Dexter, and personally
and to you, my friends, express to them
ray thanks for their kindness and 10v6."
In closing the pastor again enjoined all
of his supporters to stand with ever
increasing loyalty in behalf of the church.
By this time some of the most ardent
champions of the pastor crowded forward
to the platform, ana for nearly an hour a
levee of handshaking ensued.
Many of those who clasped the hand of
the doctor said their relations with the
church were terminated, but to every one
expressing that sentiment the pastor ad
ministered gentle reproof, advising each
to entertain no such thought or feeling.
Later in the evening Dr. Brown talked
to a reporter of The Call. He did not de
sire that the events of the evening should
be spoken of as a vindication. He had not
sought to be vindicated.
"I tendered my resignation and it has
been accepted at my earnest request."
"Will you preach again in this church?"
"I shall probably preach next Sunday
evening."
"Are you going away from San Fran
cisco?"
"Now, let me explain here," said Dr.
Brown. "I have not said to any one that
I am going away from this City, ana no
one has authority to make that statement
as coming from me. I have received as
surances that I could take with me 200
members of the congregation to an inde
pendent church, but I have not enter
tained that proposition, nor have I sought
to recruit members for another congrega
tion.
"To-day I received a dispatch from the
lowa Conference tendering me assurances
of support. That conference is much
larger and stronger than the Bay Con
ference. Here is the message. You may
take a copy of it."
The doctor was still shifting from one
band to another the important dispatch
from Dubuque which he had read during
the meeting.
Dr. Brown expressed his appreciation of
this evidence of support from the lowa
association, but again gave emphasis to
the declaration that he had not announced
an intention to leave this particular held
of labor.
The out-and-out supporters of Dr. Brown
were very indignant at the display of un
christian spirit, which they say was mani
fested by the enemies of the pastor in not
remaining for prayers. When the vote
was announced asking the Bay Conference
to reverse its action and withdraw the
censure the opponents of the pastor with
drew.
A delegation of Grand Army comrades
gathered about the pastor after the meet
ing and cave promise of support should
he decide to open another Gospel estab
lishment In San Francisco.
Some indignation was expressed at the
conduct of an individual who threw a
brickbat through one of the windows of
the lecture-room.
For a while much nervousness was appar
ent among the ladies of the congregation,
one of whom shrieked, "They're pointing
a pistol through the hole!"
Quiet was restored, and the pastor re
sumed his address. All efforts to find out
the author of the foolish trick were un
availing.
Purdie Raised a Row.
George W. Purdie was arrested outside
the church while the meeting was debat
inc on Dr. rrown. j Purdie wanted to enter
the church and Policemen Douglass and
Wilson thought he used language too
strong for the company. He was charged
with using vulgar language and obstruct
ing the street. .
