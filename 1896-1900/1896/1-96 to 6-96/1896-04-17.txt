SANTA BARBARA, Cat.., April 16.â
This is the day of the parade and the bat
tle of flowers. The long rows of grand
stand seats line the State-street pavement.
Opposite the press gallery is the judges'
stand, with & hundred distinguished-look
ing guests of honor. The background is
of a green field, from which rise majestic
eucalyptus trees and here and there a
cedar. The pavilion tent and the huge
Arlington Hotel are gay in color at the
left. Long poles rise in the air at all
points of the grand stand and bear aloft
the carnival banners, which snap and flut
ter in the wind.
"Banners yellow, glorious, golden, on its
roof did float and flow," recites a lady
who teaches school at â¢ Baltimore. The
grandstand is faced with white and yellow
and backed with palm boughs. Toward
the left of the judges' stand is a large man
with a clerical collar. His broad, smooth
face beams with good nature. He is surely
a bishop. The sun is blazing fiercely, and.
the spectators nor reached by the breeze
are beginning to swelter. The carnival
band near the press gallery has struck up
a patriotic air. The bishop likes that. â¢He
pulls his silk hat down over his eyes on
account of the sun's glare, and gazes in
tently through his spectacles.
Far down . the street and through the
floral arch the head of the procession is
seen.,. The-- announcement' comes as the I
ruu?ic ceases. Somebody on . & grayish
horse is leading the march, and the dense
column following looks much like a body
of troops.as like anything else. There is
the flag of the Nation, and those gleams
are of the bayonets. The line comes nearer ;
it has reached the arch near the Arling
ton. A brass drum marks time, and tÂ£ofe
gleams are the gleams oi bayonets. The
horses of the oflicers are prancing, and all
are bedecked with flowers. The troops are
in a guise of peace, but still the bayonets
flash. Cheers go up from the immense
throng of spectators, and the bishop gives
approval by a gentle clapping of his hands.
A military march has grown out of the
beating of the drum, and the music is of
the naval flagship band. Three hundred
marines in their blue are following the
red-caated musicians. An oflicer shouts
something unintelligible and the troops
break into a maneuvering run. The ma
rines have bouquets in the ends of their
muskets.
Four black horses are drawing into view
the first of the floats. A wagon is con
cealed beneath the floral decorations. The
design is the shield of California, grizzly
bear and all. The principal flower is the
marigold and the general effect of the
float is in orange and black.
The girls are pretty, like all the girls in
Santa Barbara. Rapidly the floats and
the carriages are coming, to the music of a
second band. Four young ladies in a car
riage of daisies are drawn by gray horses.
La France roses, instead of daisies, ex
change adornment with a second quartet
.of the native beauties. Touchstone, bow
ing and gesticulating, iB certainly the
character represented in the second float,
and with him are all the characters for
"As You Like It."

The San Francisco Call.
The Bishop, who is evidently a Metho
dist, smiles in conditional approval upon
this stage representation, and his faint
side whiskers go further than ever apart on
his broad good face. A load of hay, the
next looks like, but it is covered with
roses, and it bears a floral canopy under
which a young woman stands, all glorious
in pink satin and rose-figured organdie
and with six little girls about her. A two
horse buggy is coming as a rose basket,
another is a basKet of daisies.
Here are the caballeros, the gorgeous
men on horseback. One has coat and sad
dle of flowers that resemble violets, and
here comes a genuine load of hay. There
are six Maud Mullers on it, each holding
a wooden rake. No wonder that the Judge,
in Whittier's poem, rode sadly down the
lane as he thought of his "might have
been." Even the Bishop seems in love
with these, but the Bishop isn't sad about
it. These girls on the horses ride as girls
should ride in this Spanish region. And
what an orchestra, for four Spaniards of
the olden type; they have only three
horses, but three are plenty for four such
riders, and the eight hands all twanging
away at an old Castilian melody.
Three white horses in tandem with
harness of broad yellow ribbon are guided
by mounted horsemen attired, in colors to
match. The fashionable drag is covered
with white ribbon and the soft yellow
mustard blossoms. Two men and two
women in white and yellow throw white
and yellow roses into the crowds.
"White and yellow for me," says the
Bishop, as plainly as his good full face
can speak. A Roman chariot is in the
line and a windmill of green and roses,
"The Santa Ynez mill," in floral letter
ing, and a boy and girl, wee Spanish chil
dren disguised as a humming bird and a
buttercup and drawn by an Angora goat.
What an idea that is. A troop of boys
from some school, riding like cavalrymen,
is next. Then olive-pickers come with
their ladders on wheels and all decorated.
Then a Spanish family in a genuine old
Mexican ox wagon. It does the Bishop's
heart good to see the oxen representing as
they do the old pastoral days. The parade
has passed and countermarched. People
are pelting each other with roses, though
the battle has not commenced. There are
strict orders of managers, but this prelim
inary skirmishing cannot be prevented. A
bunch of lilies strikes the Bishop squarely
in the face, and the good man laughs.
"They toil not," he seems to say, "but
they certainly do spin."
That is the Philharmonic band that has
just begun to play on the music-stand.
The paraders are returning. The bands
stop. The soldiers of the flagship go
marching by, and however the roses hit
them they give not even a glance to the
side. A frightened tbrce has thrown its
rider, and with a leg that dangles uselessly
, the man is borne away through an open
; ing in the grand stand. Floats and the
; other vehicles are getting mixed up. The
Bishop adjusts his spectacles and rises to
| locate the cause of this confusion.
A marshal bolts tbe column. Now sounds
a bugle-call, ' and the battle of flowers
begins in earnest. Dashing girls in the
decorated buggies seem to risk their lives
in throwing the missiles of color. Touch
stone is in glory now. Everybody throws
at him. Rapidly the pavement is becom
ing strewn with the gore of red roses and
the carnations. A Spanish girl almost
leaped from her saddle to catch the bou
quet hurled by a dark-eyed youth. She
takes the missile from the air and throws
it back with suddenness and precision.
The Bishop smiles, but his face sobers
and he turns away as the mischievous
wind tosses the olive-green skirt of the au
daeions maiden and reveals a ballet-like
vision of yellow. The senorita gallops
away.
The marines break and face the unceas
ing fire of the roses. They are without
ammunition except as they can pick it up
on the pavement, but the Maud Mullers
came to re- enforce them with their big load
full of flowers, and now the fight is
fiercest, the bands playing an inspiration
for the fray.
Through a break in the column the
windmill float comes at a gallop like an
artillery piece. The double line of parade
is surging about. Bouquets are flying
like the snow in a Truckee blizzard. The
horses are prancing, the men on foot are
dodging, the floats are fluttering and sway
ing, that Spanish guitar man's horse is
like an untamed bronco, but the dark face
of the rider is absorbed in the melody
SAN; FRANCISCO, FRIDAY MORNING, APRIL _7, 1896.
BREAKING THE WORLD'S ELECTION STUFFING RECORD.
which nobody can hear in the commotion,
and the dusky fingers never miss the
strings.
During the lull the band plays "Annie
Laurie." Love is in all this war, the
marines renew the action. They may be
thinking of other Annie Lauries, but they
are devoting enthusiastic attention to the
Santa Barbara beauties on this occasion.
That George Washington in pink and blue
attempted to shout to somebody; and now
he is getting the daisies out of his mouth.
A bugle sounds, the marines step into
line, a word of command and away they
go, no attention now to the ladies they
love for a summer carnival day. No mat
ter how the roses are hurled at them, they
are in oblivion except as to the duties of
their march.
Here is a man with a great wooden pen
cil. He is as dignified as the Bishop. He
is trying to establish order among the ve
hicles, and people say that he is the
judge. People deluge him with blossoms,
but he seems obstinate in his endeavor to
straighten out the line. It is useless; so
he stops the float of the marigolds and de
livers to the driver a blue satin banner
that bears the words "First prize." The
Bishop stands right up and takes off bis
glasses. He certainly believes in the yel
low and white, but the man with the big
pencil is bigger than the Bishop to-day.
Two monks on one of the floats get a
third prize, the red banner, and the Bishop
smiles.
The ladies in La France roses are
awarded a blue banner; a blue banner is
carried away by the girls in the daisy
basket.
The girl in satin and organdie wins only
a white banner of the second place.
The Maud Mullers take a first prize and
the Bishop is happy again. '.';
He is happier still when a banner of blue
was over the yellow and gold and he
understands now that the decisions are
according to class. Banners are gener
ously awarded to the little girls on horse-'
back, the blue one goes to the maiden
whose agility shocked the Bishop. Nearly
everbo'dy of prominence, the guitar man
included, is rewarded with a banner. The
Bishop gets up and closely buttons his
coat. He is ready to go. The parade is
over and so islÂ£Â»ft *â  .t'le of roses. â

SANTA BARBARA. Cal., April 16.â
j The Native Sons carried off the first prize
of $150 with the float representing the
great seal of California. This exhibit was
a blaze of marigolds, shading off at the
base of the bronze of the Grevilla robusta.
Miss Lucy Ruiz, a beautiful Spanish girl,
with lustrous dark eyes and flowing hair,
! gowned in a flowing yellow robe, holding
: a shield of marigolds in her hand, and
| with a shining gold helmet, impersonated
I the Goddess Minerva. Behind her the
sun formed a blazing background with
! rays of marigolds dipped with yellow mar
guerites, and below were a plow and a ship
' wrought in the same flowers. At her feet
, an admirable grizzly crouched, fashioned
, of pampas plumes dyed black and brown.
Charles Gilchrist, clad as the miner, sat
below, and the driver, Alfred Ortega, wore
the colors of the float. Four black horses
with yellow harness and marigold colors
drew this float, and the four outriders at
tending it, mounted on black horses with
marigold trimmings, clad in black cos
tumes with golden sashes and trimmings
of the flowers corresponding to the deco
rations of the vehicle, were E. S. Cordero,
A. Arrellanes, Asa Loomis and C. Covar
! rubias. The very original idea .of this
\ float must be accredited to Charles Thomp
son, while Alex J. Harmer, the artist,
furnished the design and the scheme of
color.
. .The exquisite float, "Primavcra," en
tered by R. Radcliffe Whitehead of Monte
cito, carried off second honors in this class.
This was a painstaking reproduction of
Botticcelli's famous picture of "Spring" in
the Uffizzi Gallery at Florence.
.Wild oats and olive branches with pink
stock covered the sides, and beneath a tall
arch, its columns wound with pink roses
and with pink garlands dropping to the
I four corners of the base, stood Miss Hope
i Doeg, wearing a Greek tunic of pink silk,
I and overdress of faintly figured pink gauze.
; On her head she wore a crown of myrtle,
i and her ' pretty brown hair, unbound,
| flowed over her shoulders, j The 'five tiny
; Tiris. one in a white gown' and the rest
i wearing green silk and .wreaths "of pink
i marguerites, grouped at the feet .of
! the goddess, were: Amy . Martin, Mary
j Frances Otto, Dorothy Otto, Edith- Lord
and Dorothy Easton. Cyril 'â  Dontton,
wearing a Florentine costume of the fif-
I teenth century, consisting of green silk
I jerkin and tan tights, drove the four sor
j rel horses, and- Don yon Neumeyer, in a
I similar costume, acted as footman.
By the way, it is interesting to note that
this same young Yon Neumeyer is said to
: be the identical young -New Yorker who
has served as a model for the famous
' artist; C. D. Gibson.
â¢ Rivaling both of these exhibits in beauty
of design and elaborate decoration came
the By thin ia float, a massive looking
| structure, its sides trimmed with wild
j oats, on which the name of the birthplace
j of Santa Barbara appeared embroidered
|in yellow marguerites. Beneath a stately
I arch stood Santa Barbara herself, imper-
I sonated by Miss Paula de la Guerra. whose
i costume and pose were copied faithfully
j from the - famous picture of the saint
! painted by Pnlma Vecchio early in the
* sixteenth century, and which hangs in a
j great Roman gallery.
Her flowing gown was of brown cash
mere, her mantle of purple, and twined
about her shoulders and through her dark
flowing hair was a white cashmere scarf.
She stood on a raised dais, and the broad
I steps descending from it were carpeted
with marguerites, with margins of wild
oats.' In a kneeling posture below a Fran
ciscan monk was posed in the somber garb
of the brotherhood. The driver was richly
costumed in a Roman dress of white and
purple, and the float was drawn by four of
the largest bay horses in the State, har
nessed with yellow and decorated with
yellow marguerites. This Was entered by
D. Hirschler of San Francisco..
The float which it has always been cus
tomary for the flower festival to enter
without competing for a prize, this year
presented a picturesque group of char
acters from the cast of "As You Like It,"
produced last Monday. The decorations
were simple, representing a scene in the
forest of Arden, Rosalind and Orlando,
Celia, Touchstone and Audrey. The senior
duke, Sylvius, and Phoebe and several of
the foresters were all in costume and in
characteristic attitudes and the great
Percheron horses were harnessed in yellow
and green with decorations of wild
mustard. Three of the foresters in russet
and red acted as footmen and driver.
The exquisite carriage entered in the
name of Miss Bessie Cooper, which took
the first prize in its class, was completely
covered with pink duchess rosebuds, the
globular form and pliable stems of which
lend themselves most readily to decora
tion. The seats were upholstered in pink,
and the black horses were in pink harness
with, collars of rosebuds. The occupants
were Miss Cooper, Mrs. E. H. â  Sawyer,
Miss Evangeline Nixon and Miss Kathleen
Wheeler, all wearing dainty pink tarlatan
gowns, pink tarlatan hats with long black
princess feathers and black gloves. There
was a whole family in John Percy Law
ton's mail phaeton, which won second
award. . y y . , â¢
Mr. Lawton and his wife occupied the
front seat and the three Lawton babies, all
clad in white, . filled the rear seat, a lap
robe of white ; tulle, dotted with margue
rites, being drawn over their plump little
limbs. The, phaeton : was covered j with
white marguerites, gracefully arranged in
clusters about the top and solidly applied
to the body of the vehicle. The shafts were
covered with white satin and the : single
tree with pale 1 blue, and the two ; whita
horses were harnessed in pale blue satin.
The Dresden coach entered by the Hon.
Rowland Hazard represented an idea, and
this idea was that beautiful flowers may
sometimes be effectively used so as to ex
hibit their own delicate forms and colors
instead of being sacrificed in furthering a
a general effect.
In this instance the intention wasÃ_to
imitate the decoration of Dresdei china,
and the entire vehicle was draped in
white, clusters of La France roses of ex
ceeding beauty being applied on the white
ground with an artistic hand, while gar
lands of the same flowers bordered the
vehicle. The two snow-white horses were
harnessed in pink, and Mrs. C. O. Felton
and<her daughter who occupied the car
riage wore pink gowns, with clusters of
roses in Iheir hats and on their gowns. A
pretty white marguerite basket filled with
prettier children was entered and designed
by Mrs. Frank M. Whitney, wife of Santa
Barbara's Mayor-elect. The horses were
in white harness decked with daisies, and
the six little girls in the basket were clad
in white muslin. â¢
Wearing white hats trimmed with yel
low ribbons and wreaths of daisies were
Lotus Whitney, Paula Wright, Bertha
Gregory, Margaret Edwards and Adell
Voorhees.
If it had not been for the children it
would have been hard for the judges to
decide between this and the vehicle en
tered by Alexander Sedgwick, which re
ceived the second award.'
This was covered with pale yellow banks
of roses, intertwined with smilax, and the
scheme of decoration was extended to the
spirited blacK horses, which had collars
covered with the delicate flowers and wore
yellow nets dotted with the blossoms.
Mr. and Mrs. Sedgwick, Mrs. Roberts and
Mr. Campbell occupied the vehicle, all
wearing yellow and white, in harmony
with their decorations.
That somewhat aristocratic organization,
the Santa Barbara Club, is accountable
for the delightful haycart banked with
the golden blossoms of wild mustard,
thinly carpeted with oats, filled with
pretty maids in cool white muslin gowns,
wearing Maud Muller hats with yellow
ribbons and carrying rakes bowed with
yellow satin ribbons.
The conception did credit to the club
men and there was a murmur of applause
when it was handed the blue banner rep
resenting the first prize. The occupants
were Miss Gunn of San Francisco, Miss
Mabel Rowe of Los Angeles, the Misses
Georgiana and Madelaine Lacy and Miss
Kirby of San Francisco.
Miramar, that poetical little settlement
by the sea, in Montecito, furnished the
farmwagon in shape like a huge basket
decorated' with pink geraniums and filled
with a gay party, all of the ladies wearing
pink and green gowns, with charming
little caps modeled after the blossom. The
occupants were Mrs. Daggett, Mr. and
Mrs. Mower, the Misses McDonald and
Brown, Mr. Dormer, Mr. O'Brien and Mr.
Moore, who officiated as driver.
This was drawn by a pair of immense
white horses, harnessed in pink and with
pink ribbon?. - â¢ ".
Mrs. D. H. Sidebotham and Mrs. Worth
ington chose an original scheme of decora
tion for their low phaeton, combining
sheafs of barley with : marguerites in
chaste effect. .- " ; r.-lfL ,
They wore thin mull gowns,. and the
large : white â¢ parasol they; carried was
flounced with mull and quaintly decorated
with barley-heads. Their sorrel ponies
were harnessed with white.
No : more perfect scheme of color ap
peared in the entire procession than the
Dailey phaeton, occupied by Miss Mary
Loid and Miss Lacy, which carried off an
other first premium. *V.t
The body of the vehicle was covered with
cloth-of-gold roses, and the wheels were
twined with yellow banksias. The ladies
wore gowns of pale yellow, mull hats
trimmed with the same material, and
carried parasols of white dotted muslin
bowed with yellow mull. Their horse was
harnessed in yellow and liberally decorated
with banksias. \.v\'^ >hli : .
Miss Eleanor Colt and Miss Ethel
Vangban drove in a low cart, which
boasted the most unique decoration of the
day and won the hearts of the judges in
their class, their vehicle being hidden
from sight beneath sprays of the rumex,
a wildfiower growing in Ventura County
and shading from lemon yellow and cream
to old rose and dull reds tinged with
brown.
The ladies wore gowns and hats of pale
green mull. Miss Anna S. C. Blake was
represented by Miss Beryl Lord and Miss
Couteilenc, the occupants of the phaeton,
whose decorations of pink and white car
nations and roses won the second award
in this division. The canopy was covered
with the same sweet flowers, and the
ladies were gowned in pink mull with pale
green silk sleeves. ; .
Arthur Dawe, wearing olive green with
a pink sash and cap, accompanied them in
the province of a footman. . , y.

. LONDON, Ekq., April 16.â 1n the House
of Commons to-day Right Hon. P. W.
Hanbury, Financial Secretary to tho
Treasury, stated in reply to a question by
Mr. Patrick O'Brien, member for Kilkenny
City, that the Postmaster-General was at
the present time in communication with
the Postmaster-General of the United
States in regard to the future transmission
of newspaper matter from the United
States to England solely by American
vessels, and was now awaiting an answer
from the Postoflice Department in Wash
ington. "But," he said, "it should be re
membered that the Postmaster-General of
the United States has the liberty to make
his own arrangements."
At 4:25 o'clock Sir Michael Hicks-Beach,
Chancellor of the Exchequer, rose amid
Conservative cheers to deliver the speech
introducing the budget. He began by
saying that despite the fact that the ex
penditures ofthe last fiscal year had been
larger than that of any year since the last
great war, the surplus in the treasury was
the largest that had ever been known and
the credit of the country was never so
hieh. The yield of consols to the pur
chaser, he said, was just about half what
it was a century ago and a larger sum had
been applied to the reduction of the
national debt than had ever before been
applied to that end within a similar
period. The deposits in savings banks
and permanent .accounts in ordinary
banks had amounted to an unprecedented
point, and the production of gold through
out the world has been the highest ever
known. The amount of bullion in the
banks of England was Â£49,000,000 and the
reserve fund in the bank in proportion to
its liabilities was tbe highest on record.
Continuing, Sir Michael said that the
conditions of workingmen were never so
satisfactory as at present, but he feared
that the condition of agriculturists
was worse. The issue of produce
stamps supplied the best possible measure
of ascertaining that business transactions
had never reached so great a volume. Al
together, he said, the past year had been a
wonderful one. The great triumph of a
chancellor of the exchequer, he said, was
when receipts and estimates were equal,
but the figures of this year become remark
able by the fact that the receipts exceed the
estimates. Everything, he said, had had
an upward tendency, especially during the
latter half of 1895. The increase in the
value of exports, imports, railway earn
ings and bankers' and clearing-house re
turns showed a continuous expansion of
trade. The revenue for the fiscal year had
been Â£101,974,000, while for the year
1804-95 the revenue had only been Â£92,684,
--000, showing an increase of Â£7.290,000 and
making an excess of Â£5.812,000 over the
estimate.
- A great feature had been in the increase
of the revenue from tobacco, wine and tea,
the latter having steadily driven coffee out
of the market. British and Irish spirits
had also driven foreign spirits out of the
market. The imports of spirits had de
clined 19 per cent and the popular taste for
rum was greatly lessening. Tea had
yielded Â£120,000 over the estimate, im
plying an increased consumption of
10,000,000 pounds of that commodity. In
connection with this, he added, there was
a large and welcome transfer of the tea
trade from China to. British India and
Ceylon.
The receipts from wines, he said, had
been Â£1.256,000. This seemed to be largely
due to an increased consumption of vinous
1 iquor by members of the Stock Exchange
and speculators, who, it appeared con2
loled themselves in non-success and re-'
joiced in success in the consumption of
thampagne. In this way he accounted for
the dealings in 1,200,000 extra bottles ol
champagne.
After referring to the great increase in
the excise and death duties the Chancellor
turned_to the expenses of the Government
which he said had reached the total sum
of Â£97.764,000, leaving a surplus of Â£4,
--206,000, which would be applied to the
national defenses as explained in the
naval works bill. During the year, he
continued, the national debt had been re
duced Â£3,134,000, the largest reduction on
record with the exception of the reduction
during the year 1894-95. The unfunded
debt stood at the lowest point it had
reached in twenty-one years and the
funded debt had not materially increased
since the Crimean War. In thirty-nine
years, he explained, Â£190,000,000 of the
debt had been paid off, Â£100,000,000 of
which had been paid in the last thirteen
years. [Cheers.]
Some person, he said, had tried the
wisdom of this, but it was his opinion that
by this self-denying course, the country
had raised up a reserve of incalculable im-
portance. If a time of need should come
when the country would again have to
fight for its life, the reserve would enable it
without imposing a penny of taxation to
raise Â£200,000,000 for defense without im
posing an atom more debt upon the people
than the nation had borne in 1857 without
a murmur. [Cheers.]
The total deposits in the savings banks,
Sir Michael stated, were now Â£144,000,000,
which was a matter for congratulation as
far as it was due to the thrift of the work
ing classes. He did not think, however,
that a large proportion of the deposits in
savings banks belonged to the wage
earners and he did not see why the State
should undertake a banking business for
persons who were able to take care of their
own deposits and he couid not see why
the State should pay two and one-half per
cent for savings bank deposits while money
could be produced for less. Before long,
he said, there might an alteration in the
law which would reduce the interest
on large amounts. The country, Sir Mi
chael said, might be proud of the enor
mous revenue, but it was in his judgment
a grave question whether the expenditure
was not increasing faster than the perma
nent capacity of the nation could bear.
[Opposition cheers.] If the expenditure
increased while the revenue was unelastic
the country would be within a measurable
distance of having to choose between put
ting an end to the reduction of the nation
al debt and an increase of tbe taxation.
Coming to the receipts and the expendi
tures for the ensuing year, Sir Michael said
that the estimated expenditures were
Â£100,047,000, and the estimated revenue
Â£101,755,000, leaving an estimated surplus
of Â£1,708,000, which it was proposed to ap
ply to the reduction of the maximum rate
on land from 4 shillings in the pound to 1
shilling. It was also intended to increase
the grants for education.
In conclusion the Chancellor of the Ex
chequer proposed to allot the sum of Â£975,
--000 to the reduction of the agricultural
rating and Â£433,000 for educational pur
poses, leaving a moderate surplus for any
contingencies that might arise. *
LION NERO MEETS DEATH
Bob Fitzsimmons' Pet Gets a
Shock and Is Strangled on
a Roof.
The Pugilist Badly Burned While
Trying to Rescue the
Animal. .
CLEVELAND, Ohio, April 16.â 80b
Fitzsimmons' pet lion Nero is dead and
Bob himself received a very close call at
the time of the animal's demise. Fitzsim
mons is filling a week's engagement at a
local theater. He kept the lion chained
on the roof of the Natatorium. To-night
at 12 o'clock Fitzsimmons, accompanied
by Rober, the wrestler, ascended to the
lion's quarters to feed it. The pugilist
was exhausted when he reached the roof.
He leaned for support upon the first
available thing, which happened to be an
electric light wire. It snapped in two
under his weight, and one end of the wire
fell upon and clung to Nero. The
frightened brute sprang over the edge of
the roof, the wire clinging to it and burn
ing its flesh. Fitzsimmons grabbed the
chain, and after a hard struggle pulled his
pet back on to the roof, but not until it
had been strangled to death. In taking
hold of the chain Fitzsimmons made him
self a part of the deadly current, and was
terribly burned about.the hands.

this morning J. I. Kennedy, a clerk in the
auditor's office oi the Denver and Gulf
Railroad Company, shot his wife, Mrs.
Heloise Kennedy, in tbe right temple, and
his son in the mouth, inflicting wounds
that, by the most providential chance, will
not prove fatal in either instance. He
was temporarily insane as the result of
Jong illness, being now in the last stages
of consumption.
â  Immediately after he had wounded his
wife and boy Kennedy attempted to end
his own life by cutting bis throat with a
pocket-knife. The interference of his wife
and J. H. Stimson. a neighbor, prevented
his carrying his attempt to a successful
conclusion. In the city prison at 10
o'clock he again endeavored to kill him
self by severing an artery with a broken
pocket mirror which the officers had failed
to take from him.

HILL OPPOSES
INVESTIGATION
Says There *Is Nothing
Wrong With Recent
Bond Issues.
DEFENDS MR. CARLISLE.
Populists Accused of Attempting
to Stir Up a Scandal for
Political Purposes.
ALLEN MAKES A COOL REPLY.
Declares That the New York Senator
Gets as Had as a Massassugua
Snake in August.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 16.âSena
tor Gray concluded his argument to-day
against the right of Mr. Dupont to the va
cant seat in the Senate from the State ol
Delaware. The case then went over till
some future day, and the resolution offered
by Peffer of Kansas for an investigation
into the facts and circumstances connected
with the secret bond issue was taken up.
Hill opposed the resolution in a speech
which attracted attention from both Sena
tors and spectators for nearly three hours,
and which he bad not finished when the
Senate at 5:30 p. m. adjourned until Mon
day.
After the routine morning business Mor
rill (R.) of Vermont, who celebrated his
eighty-sixth birthday a few days since,
addressed the Senate to show the necessity
of a new building for the National Museum,
At the close of Morrill's remarks the bill
for the new museum building was placed
on the calendar.
The Dupont election case was taken up
and Gray (D.) of Delaware continued his
argument begun yesterday against the
claim of Dupont to the vacant seat in the
Senate from the State of Delaware. Gray
closed his speech at 2:20 p. m. and the elec
tion case went over without action.
Under the unanimous consent Peffer's
resolution for an investigation of bond
issues was taken up for consideration after
considerable antagonism by the Appro
priations Committee.
Hill (D.) of New York addressed the
Senate in opposition to the resolution. It
was, Hill said, a Populist resolution. It
had its inspiration in the Populist party.
Investigation was pressed without formal
charges, without. -specifications, without
allegations of wrong-doing, of irregulari
ties or of corruption.
The only reason assigned for it by the
Senator from Kansas was "public curios
ity." The resolution was to be passed in
the dark. The resolution did not charge
wrong-doing, but insinuated it. The
"farmers" of the Senate â the Senators
from Kansas, Nebraska and South Caro
linaâPeffer, Allen and Tillmanâ had at
various times denied the authority of the
Secretary of the Treasury to issue bonds
under the act of 1870. There was no ques-
tion to be investigated. Everybody knew
what had been done and that it had been
done in pursuance of law; therefore, it was
silly, it was undignified, it was unworthy
of the Senate, to appoint a special investi
gating committee to determine facts which
every Senator was absolutely familiar with.
Hill commented upon the resolution in
detail. One of; the points to be investi
gated was, he said, whether any officer of
the Government had received a commis
sion or a personal Teward in connection
with these bonds.
"What Senator," he exclaimed, "dares
to rise in his place and make the allega
tion? No one. Has anybody made an
affidavit to that effect? No. Where is
the Senator who rises in his place and says
he expects to prove that Mr. Carlisle or
any subordinate gained one dollar of ad
vantage? I pause for a reply."
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska spoke of Hill
"getting as mad as a Massassugua snake
in August" when questions of this kind
were approached.
Hill asserted that the resolution had
been got up in aid of a speculative lawsuit
aeainst the Secretary of the Treasury.
The House of Representatives, he said,
was open to have 'impeachment proceed
ings begun against the Secretary of the
Treasury if he had violated the law in any
particular. But the trouble was that the
resolution was only a part of the clap
trap of the times. It was part of an en
deavor to get up a scandal in order to
affect a political question.
Stewart (Pop.) of Nevada asked Hill
whether the administration was opposed
to the investigation.
"I am not authorized to speak for the
administration," Hill replied. "I have
never exchanged a word with any officer
of this administration, high or low, on this
subject, and I don't propose to.. 1 oppose
it as I would oppose any foolish, silly, un
necessary investigation which can only (in
my humble judgment) add disgrace to the
Senate. I would oppose it whether the
Secretary of the Treasury were a Democrat
or a Republican. If this resolution should
pass the men who instituted the investiga
tion will b_ covered with humiliation and
shame, and will deny that they ever
charged anything wrong against Mr. Car
lisle and his subordinates."
Hill then went on to analyze Peffer's
speech in support of the resolution and to
ridicule the pretension that Peffer and his
Populist friends were the; representatives
of the people, and he compared the pre
tension with the proclamation ofthe "three
tailors of Tooiey street," beginning, "We,
the people of England." He characterized
the Populist Senators as deserters and as
having offered to sell or exchange their
votes on the tariff question. They had no
settled, fixed purpose.
"And this Senate," he said, "is deliber
ately to agree to this Populist resolution
of investigation, on the eve of a Presiden
tial election, so as to enable these men to
throw mud at the Democratic party and
at the Republican party. It is about time
for the Senators who represent States in
terested in this question to act together.
"The object ol the resolution," Hill con
tinued, "is to disseminate scandal. The
Populist party, lives and thrives on dis
seminating scandal against the two old
parties."
Then he took up the Presidential ques
tion and sent to the clerk's desk and had
read his views as to Senator Chandler's
charge about the McKinley "boodle fund."
He would not say a word, Hill said, against
Mr. McKinley. He admired the man in
many respects. Mr. McKinley had the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 17, 1896.
courage to say that he was a candidate for
the Presidency. He did not say, as others
did, that he was "in the hands of his
friends." That usually turned out, Hill
said, that the politician found himself "in
the hands of his enemies." [Laughter.]
McKinley had the right to aspire to the
Presidency and Hill supposed that he was
making an honorable canvass for it.
Therefore he had been startled on reading
these charges of "boodle" which had been
spread before the country.
After the newspaper articles had been
read Hill said:
"I have too much confidence in the Sen
ator from New Hampshire to think that
these allegations were made thoughtlessly
or unadvisedly. I think that he knew
what he was talking about. 1 think that
he believed the allegations. They have
not been answered. They have not been
met. Abuse of that distinguished Senator
is not an answer to the allegations. A re
flection on his motives does not meet the
charges. Here is a distinguished Senator
making an allegation against a leading
candidate of his own party for the Presi
dencyâagainst the candidate who is to be
nominated â charging the corrupt use of
his money to buy his nomination. He
charges the levying of contributions on
the protected industries for the purpose of
securing a platform and a candidate suita
ble to those interests. Yet no Senator,
not even the Senator from Kansas, has
asked for an investigation. The charge
affects the elective franchise. It affects
the purity of our primary meetings. It is
a stab at the foundation of our Govern
ment. lam not proposing any investiga
tion of the charge. lam only suggesting
it. Why has it not attracted more atten
tion?"
Hill then went on to comment upon the
sugar trust investigation as another re
markable instance of silly investigations.
He described the humiliation of Senators
in having trailed upstairs to the commit
tee-room and in being put through a lot of
questions as to whether they had specu
lated in sugar stock.
"And under oath, too," Hawley (R.) of
Connecticut suggested.
"Of course, under oath," Hill replied.
"They would not take a Senator's word.
And what was the result? They found one
Senator who came before the committee
and said : 'Yes, I did buy some sugar
stocks. I should do it again; I have a
right to do it. What are you going to do
about it?' and to-day that distinguished
Senator (Quay) is the candidate, the favor
ite son of the leading Republican State of
the Union for the Presidency, and he has
got as many and as warm friends as any
man who is a candidate for the Presi
dency."
In that connection Hill created amuse
ment by referring to Senator McPherson's
maid and Senator Ransom's son as other
speculators in sugar stocks â the latter
having invested $10 or $15 in a bucket
shop speculation. And that, he said, was
the net result of that great investigation
which had been got up on account of news
paper clamor. He mentioned this, he
said, simpiy to show that Senators be
littled themselves in the eyes of the
people by ordering an investigation with
out a sufficient cause. He asked Senators
to pause before entering on any such
ridiculous proceeding again.
Without concluding his speech Hill
yielded for a motion to proceed to execu
tive business, and at 5:30 p. m. the Senate
adjourned until Monday.
LINED UP FOR BATTLE.
Rival San Pedro and Santa
Monica Delegations Arrive
at Washington.
â â â¢ <
Huntington Actively Scheming to Se
cure Legislation to Favor His
Interests.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 16. - A
battle royal will take place before the Com
mittee on Commerce of the Senate to
morrow. The rival San Pedro and Santa
Monica delegations arrived to-night and
will appear before the committee to-mor
row. The San Pedro delegation is quar
tered at the Hotel Shoreham, and one
block away, at the Hotel Normandie, is
the Santa Monica crowd. W. C. Patter
son, Henry T. Hazzard, ex-Mayor of Los
Angeles, Albert M. Stephens and H. H.
Hawgood, a civil engineer, are here in the
interest of San Pedro. The Santa Monica
crowd is at the Hotel Normandie. D. P.
Hatch, C. Cole, John W. Mitchell, J. S.
Slauson and J. B. Lankershim are in this
party. Quite naturally they went to the
Normandie, where C. P. Huntington is
stopping, together with Tweed, Cortheli
and other agents of the railroad. The
Santa Monica people held a conference
with Huntington at the Hotel Normandie
to-night. Representative McLachlan was
present. y-
They are here ostensibly for the purpose
of securing "all the money they can get
for Southern California"; that is the way
one of the delegation put it. â¢-*... .
- "We want all that Congress will appro
priate for both San Pedro and Santa Mon
ica," said this gentleman. "We do not
propose to fight San Pedro and are anxious
for the inner harbor at that point to be
improved, but we are also anxious to
secure that $2,800,000 for Santa Monica.
We should pull together and not lose all
because we are not able to agree."
This is the shrewd plan of campaign
adopted by the Santa Monica crowd at Mr.
Huntington's instigation to-night. They
will pose as representative citizens of South
ern California who are here to "get all they
can for harbor improvements in that sec
tion of the State."
This is not only shrewd politics to se
cure Santa Monica's appropriation, but,
in truth, Huntington is anxious for the
inner harbor project at San Pedro to be
provided for. He owns considerable prop
erty at San Pedro, but not in proportion
to his interests at Santa Monica. '
. The Santa Monica agitators at the Nor
mandie sent emissaries to the San Pedro
people at Hotel Shoreham to-night and
proposed that the rival delegations "stand
on common ground" and work for both
San Pedro and Santa Monica, but the San
Pedro crowd thought the ground would be
"too common," as Patterson said, and
they rejected the overtures of Mr. Hunt
ington. Messrs. Patterson, Hazzard and
Haweood said to the Call correspondent
to-night that they would never consent to
an appropriation being made for an im
provement of the outer harbor at Santa
Monica.
Robbed by the Son.
DES MOINES, lowa, April 16.â Samuel
R. Reynolds, a grain-buyer of this city,
has been robbed of $3500 which he had
secreted in the wall of his cellar when his
wife died eight years ago. He imparted
his secret to his son, then 13 years of age,
and showed him the seal which covered
the hole. To-day Reynolds discovered
that the money had disappeared. His
son is now of age, and has left the parental
roof. Officers are looking for him.
FRANKLIN WILL
STAY IN OFFICE
Defeat in the House of
Those Who Opposed
the General.
SOLDIERS' HOMES AGAIN
Continuation of the Argument
on Some of the Alleged
Scandals.
THE MANAGEMENT UNCHANGED
Irregular and Negligent Methods
Employed in Keeping the
Accounts.
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 16.â The
fight against the re-election of General W.
B. Franklin as a member of the board of
Managers of the National Soldiers' Home
resulted in the defeat of those opposed to
him, the House to-day voting 59 to 149 to
continue him on the board, as recom
mended by the Committee on Military
Affairs. There was a three hours' debate
before a vote was reached, traversing
largely the same ground gone over yester
day, the administration of the Leaven
worth Home and the policy of the board
in retaining Colonel Smith as governor
being the principal point of attack. Tracey
(R.) of Missouri, Hepburn (R.) of lowa,
Klrkpatrick (R.) of Kansas, Calderhead
(R.) of Kansas, and Blue(R.) of Kansas,
favored.the amendment proposed by the
latter to substitute the name of General 0.
O. Howard as manager in place of General
W. B. Franklin, and it was opposed by
Mabon (R.) of Pennsylvania, Grosvenor
(R.) of Ohio, Ray (R.) of New York, Sperry
R. of Connecticut and Hull (R.) of lowa,
chairman of the Committee on Military
Affairs.
The resolution named General W. B.
Franklin and George W. Steele to succeed
themselves, General T. J. Henderson of
Illinois to succeed John C. Black and Gen
eral G. L. Beale of Maine to succeed Francis
Fessenden.
By request of Henderson (R.) of lowa,
chairman of the Committee on Judiciary,
it was agreed by unanimous consent that
Wednesday and Thursday of next week be
set aside for consideration of the bank
ruptcy bill, the vots on the passage of the
bill to be taken the first thing Friday after
the reading of the journal.
The debate on the resolution providing
for the election of members of the board of
managers of soldiers' homes was then re
sumed, Tracey (R.) of Missouri, the first
speaker, opposing the re-election of Gen
eral Franklin.
Tracey said he had personal acquaint
ance with but two members of the board of
managers and that his opposition to the
re-election of Franklin had no basis of per
sonal feeling. What he had to say had its
origin largely in the reports of the board.
The administration of the board, he said,
ought to show the cost of the maintenance
of the inmates of the homes.
"I make no charge of dishonesty," he
said, "but I do say that there have been
loose, irregular and negligent methods em
ployed in keeping the accounts of the
board; that it has grown into a close cor
poration, which has grown up outside of
and independent of Congress, regardless
of criticism." ' Â> y v. : ; '-
Tracey denounced the Keeley cure main
tained at the homes. He said the records
showed that the average cost of it to the
soldiers who had taken it was $100. This
he said was wrongâ absolutely wrongâ
and should be remedied.
Mahon (R.) of Pennsylvania, advocating
his amendment to the joint resolution
providing for Congressional investigation
of the Leavenworth home, Colonel Smith's
connection with it to depend upon the
finding of the commission, said that it was
the only manly, fair way to get at the
truth. He would not vote to throw down
General Franklin on ex parte testimony.
Blueâ l want to say to the gentleman
that any investigation of this board made
by the Senate or in which it engages will
be a roaring farce.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio warmly defended
General Franklin and deprecated the
course of Blue in bringing ex parte affida
vits to the House and making them part
of the permanent records.
Hepburn (R.) of lowa, supporting the
motion to strike General Franklin's name
from the joint resolution, said it meant no
reflection upon General Franklin. It
meant only that the House proposed to
exercise its judgment and to replace him
by another man after sixteen years of un
requited service.
The House, by a vote of 55 to 130, re
fused to strike General Franklin's name
out of the resolution providing for the
election of managers of the soldiers'
homes. A vote by ayes and noes was or
dered. The vote by. ayes and noes was:
Ayes 59, noes 149. The resolution naming
Generals Franklin, Steele, Beale and T. J.
Henderson was then passed.
The amendment was opposed by the
unanimous Democratic vote, and, except
McLaurin of South Carolina, sustained by
all the Populists, and the following Re
publicans voted for it: Allen of Utah,
Baker of Maryland, Baker of New Hamp
shire, Barney, Bartholet, Blue, Broderick,
Burton, Calderhead, Cannon, Connolly,
Cooper of Wisconsin, Crowther, Curtis
of Kansas, Dolliver, Doolittle, Eddy,

Wisconsin, Mosely, Northway, Prince,
Reeves, Shafroth, Suover, j Spalding, Ste
phenson, vV. A. Stone, Suiloway, Thomas,
Tracey, Trelour, Updegraff, Warner and
Wood. The joint resolution was then
agreed toâ electing General W. B. Frank
lin and General Steele members of the
board to succeed themselves, General Beale
to succeed " Francis Fessenden and T.J.
Henderson of Illinois to succeed John C.
Black. - : â â 'â â â â¢â -'â â  â¢ â ' â â¢-'-'â â  'â¢' â 'â  : " J â ' â '"'
Half an hour was spent in unavailing
efforts to pass some private bills and at
4:35 o'clock, on motion of Dingley (R.) of
Maine, the House adjourned until to-mor
row. 7 ;â ;-'
Before announcing it the Speaker stated
that Cobb (D.)of Missouri would be ex
cused from serving on the Committee of
Banking and Currency and take the place
on the Ways and Means Committee made
vacant by the unseating of Tarsney of

NEW CIRCUIT ORGANIZED.
Glories of the Past to tie Renewed in the
Kast.
DETROIT, Mich., April 16.-On the
ruins of the old Grand Racing Circuit,
broken and dismembered by inimical legis
lation in many States, a new circuit was
organized to-day in the office of the Detroit
Driving Club, that promises to renew the
glories of the past. The cities represented
were Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus, Fort
Wayne, Indianapolis, Saginaw and the
Fleetwood track, New York, and these
cities will constitute the "New Grand
Circuit."
The new towns admitted are Fort Wayne,
Columbus and Indianapolis, they taking
the places of Rochester, Hartford and
other cities which adverse betting laws
have driven out. The purses offered in
the circuit will aggregate nearly $230,000.
Detroit heads the list with $58,500; Fleet
wood follows with $45,000; Cleveland offers
$40,000- Columbus and Fort Wavne $25,000
each; Indianapolis $20,000, and Saginaw
$15,000. *
Buffalo sent greetings and promised to
b? in line if the friendly legislation now
before the New York Legislature became a
law. Philadelphia also promises to join
the circuit if satisfactory trotting laws'are
enacted in Pennsylvania.
LATEST L. A. W. BULLETIN
Rules to Govern Racing Wheel
men During the Coming
Year.
* ***** â¢
Hints to Ardent Young Cyclists Who
Are Apt to F.y the
Track.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., April 16. -The
following L. A. W. bulletin has been given
out by Chairman Gideon:
Declared professionalâ o. L. Stevens, Ottum
wa, Iowa; own request.
Sanction grantedâ Julyl, the Silver Wheel
men, Denver, Colo.
A rule to the following effect has been quite
generously quoted as a part of the L. A. W.
racing rules, viz.:
"Any cyclist cesses to be an amateur by rid
ing after April. 1896, in a bicycle race upon
any make off bicycle offered for sale or manu
factured in any factory, store or other place of
business in < which he is employed in any
capacity whatsoever."
There is no such rule In our racing rules,
and it is not intended there shall be this year
Clause Fof the amateur rule in the L A W
constitution provides that any racing man
employed in a cycle establishment may, by a
vote of the racing board, be transferred to the
professional ranks. This does not mean that
the board will make wholesale transfers of
such employes, but that it may use its dis
cretion in transferring racing employes against
whom it may be impossible to obtain other
evidence, and by whom the board may believe
that advantages are received contrary to the
spirit of the amateur definition.
Race-meet promoters and managers of school
and college track teams will please note the
following: Every year about this time the
various colleges and schools begin to develop
racing men to represent them at the intercol
legiate and interscholastic outdoor games. It
is customary to run off one or more trials to
pick out a team. Racing throughout the
united States is governed by the L. A. W., and
the L. A. W. requires that every track race be
sanctioned. A man competing in an unsanc
tioned event is liable to suspension.
Now, young men in particular may not care
whether they are suspended or not, but they
are sure to find somebody at the final meet
from some other college who does care, and
will not allow them to ride if under suspen
sion. The trouble occurs every year, when by
a little caution It can be prevented.
Remember that every race on a track, be it
one event or more, must be sanctioned. If
you are to have any trials, send for sanction
every time. For open races a fee is charged,
but no fee is required for closed club or school
events; but in all cases send for sanction and
save your men from suspension, which in one
or more cases last year affected the standing
of the school in points won at the champion
ship meeting. : y \

LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 16.â The
largest crowd that ever gathered at the
baseball park saw Chicago defeat Louis
ville in the first championship game of the
season this afternoon. It is estimated that
10,000 people were present. The city offi
cials came down to the park on gayly dec
orated cars. After Manager McClosKey
and Financial Manager Pulliam had been
presented with gorgeous floral designs
Mayor George D. Todd pitched the first
ball across the plate and Umpire Weid
man called "play." Chicago won the
game by hard and timely hitting and su
perb fielding by Flynn, Lange, Truby and
Ryan. Both teams scored in the first in
ning, and then it was a pitchers' battle un
til the eignth, when the Colts rolled up
three runs on Dablen's three-bagger, sin
gles by Lange and Ryan and Frazer's wild
throw. Louisville could do nothing with

ST. LOUIS, Mo., April 16.â perfect
day and the champion Clevelands for an
attraction drew 14,700 baseball admirers to
Sportsman's Park for the opening game
to-day. Breitenstein had better support
than did Young, though long, hard drives
rather favored the visitors. Up to the
eighth inning the game looked like a shut
out for Tebeaii's men, when a couple of
three-base runs and a single netted two
runs. Local baseball veterans are en
couraged and believe that St. Louis will
not make the wretched finisn of the season
that has prevailed for several years. Score :

CINCINNATI, Ohio, April 16.â 1t was
an ideal day for baseball and 14.412 peo
ple witnessed the first game of the Na
tional league season between Pittsburg
and Cincinnati, 2000 of whom were ladies.
This breaks the record for attendance on
an opening day. There was a street pa
rade before the game with brass band ac
companiment. Ox the game little can be

BALTIMORE, Md., April 16.â There
was no banÂ«i of music nor street parade to
incite the ball-loving Baltimoreans to par
ticipate in the opening of the season, but
more than 13,000 persons, a quarter of
whom were ladies in summer attire,
passed through the gates of Union Park
before the _ame was begun. The early
part of the contest was marked by loose
fielding, the champions particularly being
accredited with some very harmful errors.
Anderson found McMahon to his liking
and scored three of Brooklyn's eight hits.
After the first inning only four hits were
charged against Brooklyn's twirler. Score:

PHILADELPHIA, Pa.. April 16.â The
opening game of the season between Bos

25,000 persons, the largest crowd that was
ever on the grounds of the local team.
The visitors played the better game in the
field and at the bat, and won by a score of
7to 3. Boston hit Taylor freely in the first
inning, Low and Duffy making doubles
and Tucker securing a single. The local

Delegates Instructed to Vote for the
Speaker at the St. Louis
Convention.
â¢ LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 16.â Governor
Bradley had things all his own way in the
Republican Convention this morning.
A few minutes after getting down to
business the convention almost unani
mously indorsed his candidacy for Presi
dent and instructed the delegates-at-large
to vote for him, with McKinley as second
choice.
The adjourned session of the convention
was called to order at 9:20 a. m. Judge V.
S. Deming and State Inspector C. W.
Lester were chosen electors for the State
at large. The report of the committee on
resolutions was read and adopted almost
by unanimous vote.
The free and unlimited coinage of silver
is strongly disapproved, and an unqualified
declaration made for the gold standard,
with such legislation as will keep silver
and pa] er money on equal terms of value
with gold. The usual indorsement is
given protection. Bradley is indorsed for
President as follows:
"Believing in the availability and fitness
of Governor O. Bradley as a Presidential
candidate, mindful of the splendid State
victory under his leadership, proud of his
executive ability, knowing his soundness
of convictions on the financial and tariff
questions, and confident that this man
will secure for the Republican party the
electoral vote of Kentucky and other
Southern States, we declare Jiim our choice
for the Presidency and instruct the dele
gates selected by this convention as dele
gates from the State at large to the next
Republican National Convention to cast
their votes for him as Presidential nom
inee, but in the event that his name is
withdrawn from before the St. Louis Con
vention and he ceases to be voted for
there, then they are directed to cast their
votes for Hon. William McKinley, the
great friend of protection, so long as his
name shall remain before the convention."
. The following delegates from the State
at large to the National Convention were
elected: W. J. Deboe, Crittenden County;
Rollins Burnani, Madison County; L. P.
Tarlton, Franklin County; S. E. Smith
(colored), Daviess County.

PORTLAND, Me., April 16.â The Re
publican State Convention to nominate
six Presidential electors and to choose
delegates-at-large to the Republican Na
tional Convention met at 11 o'clock. Al
most every delegate had a Reed button in
the lapel of his coat. The convention was
cubed to order by J. H. Mauley, chairman
of the State committee, who announced
Hannibal K.Hamlin of Ellsworth as chair-
man. Mr. Hamlin was received with
great applause and his speech was often
interrupted by cheers, particularly when
he spoke the name of Hon. Thomas B.
Reed.
Resolutions were adopted declaring that
"the Republicans of Maine gladly join
with their brethren in other States by pre
senting to the Republicans of the Nation
for nomination to the Presidency the
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
He needs no platform save the record of
his life. Under his administration, his
public efforts conspicuously show, would
be restored that Republican policy of pro
tection taught by Lincoln, illustrated by
the signal prosperity of the country for
thirty years and rounded out by the reci
procity of Blameâa policy which would be
adapted to the business of the country and
adjusted with care from time to time to
the changed conditions. He is opposed to
the free and unlimited coinage of silver ex
cept by international agreement, and until
such agreement can be.obtained lie believes
the present gold standard should be main
tained.
"He favors measures for the restriction
of immigration. He favors a just admin
istration of all pension legislation and is
an earnest friend of American shipping
and its returning to its former rank in the
world." â¢".,.;-â 
The following Presidential electors-at
large were nominated: John Hill of
Augusta and Joel Wilbur, of Avon. The
following delegates-at-large were chosen
to the National Convention: First Dis
trict, Amos L. Allen, Alfred; Second Dis
trict, Charles F. Littlefield. Rockland;
Third District, F. C. Burleigh, Augusta:
Fourth District, E. A. Thompson, Dover.
The convention then adjourned.
NKW JERSEY REPUBLICANS.
Delegates Instructed by the Convention
to Sxtpport McKinley.
TRENTON, X. J., April 16.â The Repub
lican State convention to elect delegates to
the St. Louis convention was held in this
city to-day. It was called to order at 12:30
by Chairman Franklin Murphy, of the
State committee.
After the reading of the call and other
preliminaries, Senator Edward Stokes of
Cumberland was named as temporary
chairman of the convention and iii accept-
ing the honor delivered a ringing speech
on prominent issues. The usual com
mittees were appointed and the conven
tion took a recess.
Upon reassembling the temporary or
ganization was made permanent and a
State committee selected. Messrs. Sewell,
Hobart, Kean and Murphy were nomin
ated by acclamation as delegates to the
St. Louis convention with Messrs. Breck
inndge. Guramer, Loudenslager and Reed
as alternates. The platform contains the
following paragraph:
"The standard of value in this country
and in the other principal commercial na
tions of the world is gold. Wages and
prices have been fixed in accordance with
this standard, and the welfareof tbepÂ°ople
demands that it should be maintained.
We regard the agitation for the free coin
age of silver as a serious obstacle to our
country's prosperity."
Congressman McEwan moved tbat the
resolutions be so amended as to embrace
instructions to the delegates to support Mc-
Kinley. He created some excitement by
pressing his point.
Senator Sewell moved that the resolu
tions be adopted as read. His motion was
carried.
A motion to instruct in another form
was unsuccessful, and the convention ad
journed.

Two Prohibition Delegates Will Not
Follow Instructions.
LANSING, Mich., April 16.-The Prohi
bition State Convention to-day got into a
wrangle over t;,e silver issue, and the fol
lowing plank was adopted after a hot de
bate :
Resolved, That the delegates sent by this
convention to the National convention are
hereby instructed to work and vote for the
adoption of a broad and comprehensive plat
form, including the free and unlimited coinage
of silver at the ratio of 1. to 1.
Delegates were chosen from the Con
gressional districts to the National con
vention, but two of them, John Russell of
New Haven and Samuel Dickie of Albion,
declared that in spite of the instructions
to vote for free silver they would vote as
they pleased at the National convention.
Contests in Alabama.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., April 16.âRe
publican conventions were held in the Sec
ond. Third and Fifth Congressional dis
tricts of this .State to-day. In the Second
Nathan Alexander and Frank Simmons
were elected delegates to St. Louis. They

conventions. One convention selected
D. L. Prentice and G. M. Murphy. They
were instructed, but opposed to McKinley.
The other convention elected S. Booth and
John Harman, both for McKinley. In the
Fifth District it was but a repetition of the
Third, two conventions and a contesting
delegation. B. W. Walker and 11. A.
Carson represent one, and are for Allison,
wnile Douglas and H. A. Carson represent
the other, for McKinley. Carson is on
both tickets and for Allison and McKinley.

ATTITUDE OF THE A. P. A.
How the Organization Stands
Toward Republican Presi
dential Candidates.
McKinley Accused of Discriminating
in Favor of Catholics as
Against Protestants.
BOSTON. Mass., April 16.â James B.
Dunn, secretary of the National advisory
board of the American Protective Asso
ciation, makes an official statement as to
the attitude of the order toward the var
ious candidates whose names will be pre
sented for nomination at the St. Louis
Convention, in which he says in substance
that the executive committee of the Na
tional advisory board, which recently
met in Washington and New York, has
reached these conclusions:
That the National advisory board adopt
no candidate as the candidate which the
order should support, as to do so at this
time would be most unwise and impolitic.
k The deliberate judgment of every member
of the committee was that such a thing as
"booming" a particular candidate should
not be done. Therefore, whosoever states
that any one candidate is the candidate
adopted by the American Protective Asso
ciation states what is not true.
After carefully analyzing the evidence
adduced, the committee found to be true
the charge against one of the candidatesâ
viz.: Governor McKinleyâ of discriminat
ing in his appointments in " favor of
Romanists and against American Protest
ants, because the latter were members of
the A. P. A.
Of the other candidates, viz. : William B.
Allison of lowa, Senator Quay of Penn
sylvania, Senator Cnllom of Illinois,
Governor Bradley of Kentucky, Governor
Morton of New York, ex-President Har
rison and Thomas B. Reed, the commit
tee was satisfied with their Americanism
and sympathy with the principles of the
order. . y .
Concerning the charges made against
Thomas B. Reed, the committee found
them to be groundless. It is also a nota
ble fact that the only State conventions
which have thus far incorporated the
principles of our order in their platform
are the States that are now booming Mr.
Reed. On such a platform, if nominated
he must stand. '
The committee regrets that it has been
unable to make any statement with re
spect to the candidates of the Democratic
party, from the fact that as yet no candi
dates have come to the surface.
If the talk of President Cleveland for a
third term should be materialized his
record is too well known to need any com
ment. The committee is, however, on the
alert, and will in due time communicate
with the order. .

WHIPPED IX A. FIGHT.
. A Santa Cruzan Now Seeks to Recover
Damages.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April 16.-An
action was filed in the Superior Court late
last evening by Thomas A. Sweeney for
$10,000 damages against F. W. Ely for in
juries received in a fight that occurred in
the Pilot Club recently. The action is not
considered seriously by the friends of Mr.
Ely, as they do not believe it will result in
a trial. The trouble grew out of an accu
sation by Ely that Sweeney had said slan
derous things about him and responded
insultingly when a retraction was de
manded. Ely knocked him down and the
matter was hushed up until this suit was
brought. Both men are prominent.

in an Oregon Shooting Scrape.
ALBANY, Ok., April 16.â Yesterday at
Halsey, Owen Bond and John Pearl quar
reled, Pearl accusing Bond of bestowing
too much attention upon Mrs. Allingham,
Pearl's daughter. The men had a fight
and afterward met in Pearl's livery-stable
and renewed the quarrel. Pearl's son,
Elmer, and his brother, Silas, were with
him. Bond called to the City Marshal to
protect him, saying there were too many
against him. At the same time he drew a
revolver and fired at John Pearl. As he
did so Pearl's son seized Bond's arm. The
ball missed Pearl and struck Ira Stroud, a
cattle- buyer of this city, who at that
moment entered the stable and alighted
from his horse. The ball entered the
lower portion of the abdomen. It is be
lieved Stroud will die.
BLIGHTED BY THE FROST
Grapes and All Tender Plants
and Vegetables Injured in
Many Places.
Irreparable Damage to the Raisin
fCrop Reported From Fresno
and Vicinity.
FRESNO, Cal., April 16.â For the past
three days a cold wind has been blowing a
stiff gale from the north, gradually lower
ing the temperature. About 1 o'clock this
morning the frost point was reached,
which has caused enormous if not, indeed,
irreparable damage to the raisin and grape
crop for this year. Owing to the tender
shoots just forming it is a most critical
period for cold weather. Reports differ as
to the per cent of damage, but it is known
to be very great. All tender plants and
vegetables also suffered from the frost,
which amounted to a freeze in the low
land. Owing to the advanced state of the
fruit crop the damage, it is thought, will
be comparatively small. This loss, how
ever, cannot be very accurately estimated
for a few days. The weather is still cold
and gusty, with the temperature danger
ously near the freezing point.
San Joaquin. Valley Suffers.
STOCKTON, Cal.. April 16.â The heavy
frost of last night, following that of yes
terday morning, had a killing effect upon
the grape crop in this part of the country.
Heavy smudge fires were burned last night
and the night before at the vineyard of
Henry Armbrust and at the West vine
yard here, but last night they did no good
and fully half of the crop is destroyed as
well as the potato crop in this county.
The damage to Armbrust alone counts sev
eral thousand dollars, and that to West is
greater. In Lodi, Modesto, Woodbridge
and Acampo the damage to early vegeta
bles and potatoes is great.
Effects of the Frost at Modesto.
MODESTO, Cal.. April 16.â A great
amount of damage has been done in this
section by the frosts of the last two nights
principally to the grape crop. In the vine
yards along the rivers and creeks there has
been especial damage, grapes suffering to
quite an extent. Tomatoes and potatoes
are killed. Upland gardens are not af
fected much. No reports of damage - to
other products have yet been heard.
Napa Orchardists Alarmed.
NAPA, Cal., April 16.â two nights
past there has been some frost here and
last night it was very heavy. Orchardists
say it is hard to tell so soon just what the
extent of the damage is, but it is probable
that a large part ot the crop not taken by
former frosts is now ruined or seriously
damaged, It is cold and clear again to
night. ' yy Â--.'â¢
Tulare's Fruit Crop Blighted.
TULA.RE, Cal., April 16.â The " ther
mometer recorded 28 deg. last night.
Prunes are believed to be badly damaged,
while the first crop of grapes is nearly all
destroyed. About 25 per cent of the pear
crop is ruined. Peaches and other fruits
protected by dense foliage did not suffer
materially. Fruit men are fearful of the (
outcome of to-night.
Serious Damage Around Visalia.
VISALIA, Cal., April 16.â Last night's
frost has done considerable damage to the
fruit in and around Visalia. No estimates
can be given now, but it looks very serious.
Tramps Fire a Chico Barn.
CHICO, Cal., April 16. â This morning
at 2 o'clock a barn belonging to Hiram
Sloat was .totally destroyed by fire. The
fire burned very rapidly, and it was with
difficulty that ten head of cattle were
saved. The barn contained a iot of hay,
two horses, three sets of harness and a top
buggy, all of which were consumed. The
fire was caused, no doubt, by tramps sleep
ing there.. No insurance.
CHARGED WITH
DOUBLE MURDER
Important Arrest at Seattle
by a Minneapolis
Detective.
ALLSOP, ALIAS AUSTIN.
Evidence That He Is One of the
Worst Criminals of the
Century.
TALE OF CBIME IN TWO CITIES.
Secured His Victims Through Employ
ment Agencies, Married, Killed
and Robbed Them.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 16. "James E.
Allsop, alias A. A. Austin, wanted for
double murder, was arrested in Seattle
this afternoon by Detective John Court
ney of the Minneapolis police department.
The crimes arc alleged to have been com
mitted in Duluth, Minn., and Tacoma,
this State, the victim in each instance
being a woman. It is charged â Court
ney says the evidence is most conclusive â
that on the 21st of August, 1894, Allsop,
who was then going by the name of Aus
tin, decoyed Miss Lena Olsen under prom
ise of marriage from Minneapolis to Du
luth, and in that city took her to an iso
lated place on the shores of Lake Superior,
and after murdering her robbed her of
$450 in cash. Having been choked into
unconsciousness her skull was then crushed
with a club.
Allsop met Miss Olsen through the
agency of a Minneapolis employment bu
reau, having represented himself as a rich
widower from Los Angeles, Cal., and that
he had a daughter 12 years old and was
searching for a trustworthy housekeeper,
money being no object.
During the boom days Allsop was en
gaged in the real estate business at
Tacoma with William Burroughs, and in
1890 his wife was killed by, supposed at
the time, a runaway. Later it was
whispered that the woman had met a foul
death and Detective Courtney says there
is no doubt but that she was murdered.
In 1892 Allsop married Miss Mintborn
at Tacoma, who is now an attachee in the
Auditor's ofiice of Pierce County. Three
months after his second marriage Allsop
fled from Tacoma and was arrested in'
Minneapolis at the instance of George H.
Hollidge of the Tacoma Light and Water
Company, charged with having secured
$7000 by false representations. He slipped
through the meshes of the law and after
the commission of the Duluth crime left
for parts unknown, having since been a
fugitive with big rewards offered for his
capture . by the city of Duluth and St.
Louis County.
Detective Courtney got trace of Allsop
through a Minneapolis lady with whom
the fugitive at one time boarded and in
whose possession he left a valise contain
ing a will and a copy of the Tacoma News
giving a description of him and an account
of his arrest in Minneapolis. The descrip
tion tallied with that of Austin and the
signature to the will was found to be iden
tical with the writing of Austin on a
Duluth hotel register. So with these clews
Courtney headed for Tacoma, where the
present Mrs. Allsop and a daughter by his
first wife reside.
Allsop, it appears, has been flitting back
and forth between Tacoma and Seattle for
several weeks. In this city he registered
as J. Olsen, the name of the woman whose
life he is charged with having taken.
Courtney will JÂ£ave for the East with his
prisoner a3 soon as the necessary requisi
tion papers have been procured. Allsop is
an Englishman by birth and 40 years of
age.
A BAKERSFIELD TRAGEDY.
Dr. Herman Lemke Is Fatally
Shot by a Discharged
Employe.
The Latter Also Wcucdei, but His
Condition Is Not Considered
Critical.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., April 16.â Dr.
Herman Lemke, a well-known veterinary
surgeon, and Lyons Brown, a discharged
employe of Lemke, had a shooting scrape
this evening in the dining-room of the
Lemke residence which may cost both
their lives. Lemke is shot through the
lower part of the right lung and will have
a narrow chance for life. Brown is shot
in the upper part of the left lung, but not
so dangerously as Lemke.
Brown was probably the aggressor,
though accounts differ. He had been
working for Lemke some time, but was
discharged -a few days ago on account of
overtures made by him to a female cook
in Lemke's house. There was $50 or $60 in
wages /doming to him, and he demanded
immediate settlement. Lemke said he
would settle this afternoon, out owing to a
misunderstanding about the place the
men did not meet.
This evening about 7 o'clock, while
Lemke was eating supper with his wife
and baby, Brown came into the house and
demanded instant settlement of his wages.
Being refused, he drew a pistol and tired
five shots over Mrs. Lemke's head at
Lemke. The first two shots took effect,
one in the shoulder and one in the lung.
Lemke jumped up and fired twice at
Brown as he was running away, hitting
him once, while the other shot missed.
Brown was taken to jail, where his
wound was dressed, and Lemke is at home
in a dangerous condition. >
Brown says Lemke drew first, but his
gun would not. work, and, thinking his life
was in danger, he drew and fired. first: but
he is contradicted by Mrs. Lemke and the
cook, who saw the whole affair. ' yVy; :
Portland Democrats Indorse Pennoyer.
PORTLAND, Or., April 16.âEx-Govern
or Sylvester Pennoyer was indorsed by
the City and County Democratic Conven
tion to-day for Mayor. A full city and
county ticket was nominated and the
meeting was very harmonious. Pennoyer
was first selected by the Populists of the
city and his chances of election are good.
Radical reforms are promised in munici
pal affairs if the ex-Governor is elected.
The fight between the candidates of the
two factions of the Republican party and
Pennoyer will be a hot one. - -

GOVERNOR BUDD
AND MAYOR SUTRO.
Criticism That Arouses the
Indignation of the
Executive.
INSINCERITY CHARGED.
The Deed of a Site for the
Affiliated Colleges Not
Yet Signed.
TOO MUCH OCTOPUS TALK.
Intimation That the Mayor's Regard
for the Public Is Governed by
Dimes and Nickels.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 16.â The
method pursued by Mayor Sutro in criti
cising the executive has aroused the ire of
Governor Budd, and. in speaking of the
matter he said :
"When the Legislature had closed mid
all my official acts regarding legislation
were over, and Mayor Sutro was in full
possession of his faculties, he telegraphed
me as follows:
- Pan Fraxcipco, March 29, 1895.
Ib Governor James 11. Budd: Please permit me
to congratulate you upon the great service you
have rendered the citizens of San Francisco
by preventing the streetcar fare bill to become
a law. 1 know the pressure which was brought
to bear upon you. You stood as firm as a rock
and to-day we look upon you as -'the noblest
Roman of them all." Adolph^itro, Mayor.
The cares of office and other matters
have so worried him since then that he
denounces every man, woman or child
who differs from him in opinion with re
gard to the octopus. All that I as Gov
ernor asked or wanted was that he comply
with his promises made to the regents of
the university, and I was backed in my
demand by the following letter:
San Francisco, April 2, 1896.
To his Excellency J. H. Budd Esq., Governor of
Californiaâ My Dear Sir: Permit us to call
your attention to an important matter in the
interest of the Affiliated Colleges of the uni
versity. One of the principal arguments used
by the committee of the Affiliated Colleges to
procure the appropriation from the Legis
lature for building the Affiliated Colleges was
that the present medical college was situated
at too great a distance from the City and
County Hospital, where the medical students
were obliged to spend half of their time. The
great objection that was urged against the
selection of the isutro site for the Affiliated
Colleges was that lt was a still greater distance
from the City and County Hospital than the
present medical college. â¢ â¢'."â y
As an inducement to the committee to ac
cept the Sutro site; and as an offset to compen
sate for the distance his Honor, Mayor Sutro,
repeatedly promised the committee that he
would establish on the adjoining portion of
the site a large library; that he would endow
the library go that ii.would be self-sustaining;
that he would place in the nands of a board of
trustees the library, the library building which
he would erect, and substantial property, the
income of which would support the Horary.
He asked tne committee for a few weeks' time
to select the board of trustees into whose
hands he was to place the library and Its en
dowment. \. ,y, .
Permit us to call your attentiou to the fact
that his Honor, Mayor Adolpb Sutro, has
not complied with his promise. As members
of the committee who worked incessantly for
several years to procure the appropriation to
build the colleges, we most respectfully pro
test against a dollar of the appropriation bsing
expended in building the affiliated colleges on
the Sutro site until his Honor, Mayor Sutro,
has complied with his promise. Yours, re
spectfully, W. F. McXutt, W. E. Taylor, W. M.
Seaby, L. L. Dunbar. A. A. d'Ancona, L. L.
Goddard; T. A. Bcckef, chairman committee
for colleges of pharmacy.
. "Mayor .Sutro appeared before "' the
regents for the purpose of asking an ex
tension of time before entering into this
contract. Judge Wallace was chairman of
the committee that had waited upon him
and insisted upon a definite answer. In
stead of simply asking for the time, which
would have been granted him imme
diately, he went ofT into a rambling tall.
about the octopus, its influence over all
bodies, and finally stated that it was en
deavoring to influence the regents in re
gard tothe Affiliated Collegeson the Sutro
site. In his talk he went back to the days
when he was fighting for the Sutro tun
nel, and talked more on other subjects
than the one before the board.
"When he had finished I stated, as was
my duty, the position of the board, which
was that it asked no more than he had
promised in writing, and would take no
less. On a motion made to relieve him
from his promise and accept this site I
strongly stated that I would not be
whipped into line by his threats of octo
pus influence. The very head and front of
my offending hath this intent; no more.
The regents of the university stand too
high to be injured by the ramblings
of any man, and my record on the rail
road question is too well known to be in
jured by a gentleman who can see no hon
est man in the world other than himself,
and who cries 'octopus' as the boy cried
'wolf for his own purpose.
"If Mr. Sutro wishes to keep his prom
ises, well and good ; but he cannot avoid
keeping them by any abuse of the Gover
nor of this State or the board of regents of
the University of California. My first
official act as Governor-was to call the at
tention of the Legislature to the funding
bill in the following language:
While as legislators you cannot pass any act
directly bearing upon the subject of transcon
tinental transportation, still you may instruct
your Senators and advise your Representatives
in Congress thereon, and I would suggest that
you so advise and instruct In favor of Govern
ment construction and control of the Nica
ragua Canal. I also suggest that you instruct
and advise against all Pacific railroad refund
ing bills. The Government might with profit
to the Pacific States foreclose on the property
and operate the mortgaged roads, under proper
regulation, at a rate of charges to be meas
ured by the cost of the service.
"The Legislature, acting upon my mes
sage, passed the anti-funding bill resolu
tion, which I caused immediately to be
telegraphed to Tames G. Maguire. As
soon as the question came up this year as
to whether they had been properly re
ceived I caused a certified .copy to be
made by the Secretary of State, and dur
ing the present session of - Congress I
mailed to every member from California
a certified copy of said resolution, so that
every member of Congress would know
exactly the stand taken by the Legislature
and the Governor of this State.
"1 have said all on the funding bill that
an official in my position properly could
say. I stand as firmly on my declarations
to the Legislature as i did t_e day they
were uttered. In my opinion the declara
tions of Sutro are ."imply a pretext under
which he will endeavor to avoid keeping
bis promise to the regents, and 1 now pre-
I diet that when the time comes he will
i find some technicality or excuse for not
' carrying out his agreement. 1 defy any
| man to show a single instance in which he
i has kept his promises to the public except
j in those schemes for the avowed benefit of
j tne populace which are marked by the
j jingle of nickels and dimes as they pour
into the Sutro pocket."
MUST GIVE UP THE CUP.
The Result of the 100-Mile Relay Race
Causes 111 Feeling.
SAN JOSE. Cal., April 16 âThe refusal
of the Bay City Wheelmen to give np the
cup won in tbe 100-mile relay race by the
Garden City Cyclers is the cause of a great
deal of ill feeling toward them, as the de
cision of the referee disqualifying them is
sustained by all disinterested witnesses.
I. Percy Mills, when seen in reference to
a publication iv a San Francisco paper
to-day, said: "The statement by Mr.
Waters of the Bay City Wheelmen in the
Chronicle, that the exchange between
Raynaud and Vincent of the Bay
City Wheelmen was made within the
boundary lines, does not correspond to
the statement made by him to me a
short while after it happened, as he said
at that time the exchange was made a
very tew feet on the outside of the flag,
and I replied it was immaterial if it was
done within a few feet. But I found after
inquiring of the bystanders, who were
disinterested parties, that the exchanee
was made about 100 feet outside of the
boundary.
"The Bay City Wheelmen's man Vincent
was sitting down outside of the boundary
line before the riders came along, and Mr.
Waters, Mr. Vincent and myself were talk
ing about the placing of the flag. I" stated
to them then that it was convenient to
have a watering tank to place the boundary
flagon, as it made it very easy to see where
the packet should bepassed.
â¢'Mr. Waters said, 'Have you got it in
the right place?' and I said, "Yes; exactly
where it should be.'
"In reference to my refusing to disqual
ify the Bay City Wheelmen, I emphati
cally deny the same, as when the first pro
test was filed it was by a Garden City
Cycler, and I stated then and there that
I hated to see a protest coming from a
Garden City Cycler and had a notion to
disallow the same, but the protest came
from other sources, and 1 was compelled to
take notice of it, and I immediately found
out from disinterested parties and mem
bers from t > c Reliance, Acme, Imperial i
and Olympic Club men that Rose j
of the Acme Club yelled a warn
ing to the Bay City Wheelmen rider I
that he was making the exchange outside j
of the boundary line and he refused to
rectify the mistake, but kept riding along,
thereby getting a flying start and gaining
perhaps thirty seconds on the other rider.
"The protest was telegraphed to George |
H. Stratton of the Olympic Club before
the result of the race was announced, and
at the time I was writing the same it was
reported in the telegraph office
that the Garden City Cyclers were
in the lead. 1 did " not ren
der my decision to any one except
the proper party, George if. Stratton, and |
never said to any one I would disallow the
protest, but stated I would like to if it |
only came from a . Garden City Cycler.
In deciding the protest I did not
take any one man's word but that of
eight or ten, and from what I could see of |
it myself and the statements made by the j
diffeient riders. As the matter now stands !
the Bay City Wheelmen must give their i
cup up to the Garden City Cyclers or be
expelled from the California Associated
Cycling Clubs."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. APRIL 17, 1896.
DE BARTH SHORB
PASSES MAY
Succumbs to Bright's Dis
ease at His San Gabriel
Home.
CAREER OF USEFULNESS.
Was a Leading Spirit in the
Development of California
Resources.
HIS POPULARITY IN POLITICS.
While Wealthy at Various Times, He !
Died in Comparative
Poverty.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 16.â Hon.
J. de Barth Shorb died at his San Gabriel
home, San Marino, after a lingering ill
ness, at 7:45 o'clock this evening. He had
been a sick man for several years, and his
demise was not altogether unexpected.
Death was caused by a complication of
diseases, but his principal malady was
Bright's disease of the kidneys.
Probably no citizen of California en
joyed a wider acquaintance than J. de
Barth Shorb. Certainly no one was more
closely identified with the development of
the southern part of the State.
He was the pioneer wine manufacturer
of Southern California, and one of the
chief promoters of every public interest in
this section, and in fact of the whole State,
being almost as well known in business
circles in San Francisco as in Los Angeles.
Mr. Shorb was a native of Maryland.
He came to California in 1864, after being
graduated in law. Instead of settling
down to the practice of his profession,
however, he undertook the management
of the Philadelphia and California
Petroleum Company's oil-developing busi
ness in Ventura County, which was the
first experiment of the kind attempted in
this State, and failed, although backed by
the late Thomas Scott, then president of
the Pennsylvania Railway Company. ; : v\;
Shorb lost all the money he had in the
oil business, and was glad to accept a civil
appointment on the engineering corps of
the United States army, which he held for
many years. During this time he began
to acquire title to gold-bearing lands in the
Temescal grant, better known as the San
Feliciano placers. While thus engaged he
married the eldest daughter of Don Benito
D. Wilson, one of the wealthiest pioneer
residents of Southern California.
After marriage he established his home
at San Gabriel, adjoining that of his
father-in-law, where he reared his family
and lived till the time of his death.
No private residence in Southern Cali
fornia was better known than San Marino,
the hospitable home of J. de Barth Shorb.
Soon after settling down at San Gabriel
Mr. Shorb engaged extensively in viticul
ture and started the first winery in
Southern California, which Droved a finan
cial success. About ten years ago he in
terested English capitalists in the winery
and formed the present San Gabriel Wine
Company, one ofthe biggest organizations
of the kind in the State.
During the boom Mr. Shorb engaged ex
tensively in real estate transactions and
enterprises of various kinds requiring
large amounts of capital. Some of his
latest ventures were not entirely success
ful, and left his estate more or less in
volved financially.
J. de Barth Shorb was a lifelong Demo
crat, and took a lively interest in politics.
He held office at various times. In 1892
he was prevailed upon to accept the Demo
cratic nomination for County Treasurer,
and was elected by a large majority over
his predecessor, Colonel J. Banbury, who
had been renominated by the Republi
cans
Mr. Shorb did not hold office long, how
ever, before ill health compelled him to
go to Philadelphia for treatment. As he
remained more than sixty days out of the
State the office was declared vacant, and a
Republican deputy whom he had retained
was elevated to the position of treasurer.
Since then Mr. Shorb has not been en
gaged very actively in business, as his
health would not permit. During the last
few months he sank gradually away, until
death ended his sufferings this evening.
FOR SAN PEDRO HARBOR.
The Loa Angeles Council of Labor Scores
the Octopus.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 16.âInter
est in the harbor question centersÂ«at pres
ent in the hearing before the Senate Com
merce Committee at Washington to-mor
row. Lively developments are expected
when the delegations sent from here to
look after the respective interests of San
Pedro and Santa Monica get the ears of
the Senators and proceed to enlighten them
on the local situation.
An additional mass of information was
wired to the Free Harbor League repre
sentatives at Washington ' this evening.
Among the matter sent was a petition
signed by several hundred of the leading
members of the Chamber of Commerse
urging Congress to make an appropriation
for both the inner and the outer harbor of
San- Pedro. The petition was got up
because emissaries of the Southern Pa
cific Company were circulating a paper
purporting to show that the senti
ment of the Chamber of Commerce favored
an appropriation for a deep-sea harbor at
Santa Monica and for the inner harbor
only at San Pedro.
| Ex-Mayor Workman, who helped to cir
culate the petition asking for . two appro
priations for San Pedro, secured the signa
tures of 125 members of the Chamber of
Commerce who are in the wholesale, trade.
The very few wholesale merchants who
refused to sign it gave as their sole excuse
that they did. business with the Southern
Pacific and were afraid the octopus would
strangle them if they signed such a paper.
John F. Humphries and others made a
thorough canvass of the general member
ship of the. Chamber of Commerce, and
secured the signatures of a large majority
of them to the petition for a dual appro
priation for San Pedro. The canvass left
no doubt in their minds that nine-tenths
of the members favor San Pedro as the site
for the deep-sea harbor.
The Los Angeles County Council of
Labor has reaffirmed its opposition to
Huntington's proposed harbor grab by the
adoption of the following emphatic decla
ration, to which there was but one dissent
in. voice at the last meeting: j.v*
The issue; has at last been distinctly
defined. As we view the harbor matter
.ere is either one side or the other for the
citizen to line up on. . He :is either for San
Pedro and the people's harbor or he is
against San Pedro. There is no middle j
ground. The citizen who advocates the
proposition of two harbors off the Los
Angeles County coast, both to be created
by the expenditure of the people's money,
is influenced to such action by one of the
following motives:
Kirs âHe is the tool of Mr. Huntington
and the corporations he represents.
Secondâ He is so at the behest of a polit
ical bjss. V -.y
Third â He favors Santa Monica because
his individual interests will be subserved
thereby.
There will not be two deep sea harbors
off the coast of this county. To place
them there would be a wasteful expendi
ture of the money of the people. You asK
why? Because they are unnecessary and
are not required by the demands of com
merce. Organized labor is not calling for
any looting of the public treasury to en
hance the inteiests of Huntington and a
few others who may have investments at
Santa Monica. Public improvements we
are for. first, last and all the time. y'-Vyf
\ While this is true we do not propose to
sit idly by and see the people's money
spent for the pecuniary aggrandizement of
the worst enemy labor has in these United
States, Collis "P. Huntington, without
entering a most decided protest. That
protest is of record and by it we stand.
FOUGHT A BIG BATTLE.
Bloodiest Engagement of the
Cuban War Occurred at
Lechuza.
In the Thick of the Fight Was a
Gallant Company of Brave
Amazons.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 16.â A Herald
special from Tampa, Fla., says: Further
information received from private sources
in Havana show that the bloodiest engage
ment of the war- was fought Tuesday at
Lechuza. The Spanish forces under Colonel
Linares suffered overwhelming defeat at
the hands of Antonio Maceo, who com
manded a force of 8000 men in a strong
position.
Spanish reports place Colonel Linares'
force at 1500, of whom 450 were killed and
500 wounded. The insurgents lost 200
Killed and about 400 wounded.
The Spanish plan was for three battal
ions to attack Maceo simultaneously, but
Colonel heverras' battalion failed to ar
rive. He is now being court-martialed.
Maceo led his troops into the thickest of
tbe fight, and Colonel* Linares' forces re
treated in disorder. They finally made a
stand on the wharf of the San Claudia
plantation behind rude fortifications until
a warship came to their rescue. The Cu
ban forces on the shoie made sad havoc
with the troops as they embarked, shoot
ing them down in their boats.
In the battle the Amazons, a company
of Cuban women, fought bravely.
In an effort to capture Colonel Linares
an insurgent. Alvarez, got separated. See
ing his danger Mrs. Alvarez and several
others followed him. Both husband and
wife were caught in the Spanish lines and
tried to fight their way back with ma
chetes.
Thinking that his wife was at his side
still, Alvarez made his escape, but she
was cut off at the last moment and was
literally hacked to nieces by Spanish
machetes. In his grief and chagrin Al
varez shot himself seriously.
General Maceo ordered him to appear
before him. On demanding a' reason for
his crime Alvarez said be could not en
dure life purchased by his wife's death.
Maceo replied, "Pray God you may
die, for if you live I will surely hang you.
Cuba needs men too sorely to lose any ex
cept in the face of the enemy."
The news of the Spanish defeat has pro
duced a great sensation in Havana and
the censors nave been forced to admit
many details.
SANTA BARBARA'S
GREATEST DAY,
Continued from First Page
Alice Williams of Naples, the owner of the
little steeds. Smilax, geranium leaves and
roses formed the simple decoration.
The tennis club exhibit, which insists
upon its title of a tenuis club, one of the
most effective pictures of the day, was
trimmed with wild mustard and drawn by
two white horses tandem, the one in ad
vance being controlled by two mounted
outriders. - y .
The occupants were: Dr. and Mrs.
White, Miss Lelandand Miss Noble. Mark
Brownsill and L. Fred Lamb were out
riders, ana all wore plain white suits and
hats with yellow bands. The ladies and
gentlemen in the trap carried j rackets and
employed them as new and efficient
weapons in the battle of the flowers. This
won the first prize.
The dainty Sedan chairs, fashioned of
bamboo and adorned, the one with pink
Duchesse roses and the other with white
La Marques and smilax, had for their fair
mistresses Miss Stuart and Miss Mary
Stuart, each of the ladies being costumed
after the fashions of the eighteenth cen
tury, their dresses being pink and white
with high coiffures, powdered and decora
tions of roses corresponding with their ex
terior adornments.
Their bearers, Fred Wright, Robert
Stuart, Mr. Buch and Egbert Thompson,
were in Continental costume, the bearers
of the pink chair wearing white coats with
pink satin facings, and the bearers of the
white chair white with green facings. This
won first award in the class of novelty
other than equestrian.
Second place in this class was taken by
the Roman chariot covered with pink
roses, occupied by Miss Rosamond Meigs
and Constance Delaney wearing flowing
gowns of pink and driving three horses
richly decorated with pink roses.
Two Africans of sable hue and costumes
of Roman slaves, with bare legs and feet
and leathern sandals, walked at the horses'
heads, and a droll little darkey, who
would confess to no name but San Diego,
sat at the ladles' feet.
Third place in this class was taken by a
band of six Spanish olive-pickers from Ell
wood Cooper's ranch, trundling olive lad
ders on wheels and prettily decorated.
â¢ A picturesque but somewhat unwieldy
windmill, entered by Z. de V. Thornereau
of Santa Ynez, attracted much admiration,
but an exhibit which perhaps aroused
more interest and curiosity than any other
in jthe parade and which was in a sense its
most picturesque feature was entered by
E. Cota and was somehow overlooked.
This was a genuine oxcart of the olden
style drawn by two beautiful Jersey steers,
It looked like a truncated prairie schooner
save that the sides were open and it was
canopied with flowered calico.
In it sat three Spanish women in ancient
costumes, Luisa Cordero, Margarita
Valencia and Romaldo Pico, the latter
seventy years of age, and a youth named
Vasquez. The vehicle had but two heavy
wooden wheels. It was simply adorned
with roses.
The class known as equestrian novelty is
always sure to bring forih a number of in
teresting exhibits. Kinton Stevens of
Montecito, who last year bore off the prize
as an Arab, won the first award on this
occasion, costuming as a knight in armor,
the overlapping scales of his waistcoat be
ing formed of English ivy leaves.
Helmets, leggings and the decorations
of his horse were of yellow marguerites,
the animal wearing a yellow visor.
W. L. Thacher, head of the aristocratic
boys' academy in the Ojai Valley, gratified
a number of his pdpils by joining them to
form a band of cowboys, wearing broad
sombreros and white riding suits, with
decorations of brodisea or wild hyacinth.
All rode white horses and the animals
were tastefully trimmed with the same
delicate flower. The students were L. J.
Bradley, H. L. Billson, P. R. Brown, P. S.
Palmer, E. A. Palmer, S. V- Smith, J. P.
Weeden, W. McCormick and S. Charles
Came. The boys waved aloft the white
banner with a will when it was handed
them:
Lottie Allen, dressed to represent a pink
rose, received third award. One of the
most charming features of the procession
was the miniature vehicle entered in the
name of Osmond de la Torre.
Little Osmond was clad from head to
foot and even to the tips of his fingers in a
skin-tight suit of red and green change
able silk, with go'den gauzy wings, and
on his head a humming-bird, which he
typified with his costume.
His little companion, Minnie Elizalde,
was dressed to represent a buttercup and
this bright wild flower decorated their
tiny cart. It was drawn by an Angora
goat harnessed in yellow and led by Joe
Elizalde in white and yellow.
Alice Day, wearing white mull very
prettily trimmed with wild hyacinths and
riding a white horse, took the first prize
among girl equestrians.
Margaret Fulton, decorated with star
shaped collar and cap of white m argue
rites and with her pony similarly adorned,
came second, and Clarinda Stafford, simply
clad in white, her horse heavily trimmed
with white rosebuds, received third award.
A. D. Bannerman, the marshal's aid,
rode a bay horse, the bridle of yellow
satin, the collar and saddle covered with
white roses. He carried a shield of white
roses with a yellow bow in the center.
Jennie Soence, who bore off the first
prize among ladies on horseback, repre
sented that brilliant flower, the strelitzia.
She was clad in green and orange and wore
two of the great blossoms. y â¢?
The rider, whose white costume and
cavalier cloak wrought of brodifea at
tracted every eye and to whom the blue
flag was handed, was Ronald Thomas, a
retired New York stockoroker, who makes
his home in Santa Barbara.
John T. Gould, who came second, wore
the dark blue suit trimmed with tiny
golden acacia blossoms, sash, hatband,
saddle and blanket, yy
Henry Howard, the graceful young
river wearing white and gold, his horse
decorated with white roses, found first
favor in the youths' class, with Alfonzo
Bermudez, in red and yellow, second, and
Oscar Ruiz third.
The judges generously strained a point
to give a second prize of $20 to the Spanish
band of three pieces, which entered the
parade, although they did not properly
come into any specified class. Sacro
Romero, Baltasar Ruiz and Robert Ruiz
were the musicians.
H. F. Maguire found first favor among
the marshal's aids. His decorations were
creamy rosebuds. â¢ William Alston Hayne,
whose decorations were yellow marguer
ites, came second, and Bert Baker, riding
a black horse trimmed with pink roses,
was third.
W. H. Maris, a marshal's aid. had his
leg broken by the kick of a horse while
passing the tribunes. Clinton B. Hale,
who tried to assist Maris, was stepped
upon by a horse and injured about the
head and ankle.
Upon this occasion the festival has been
rich in'music. Herr Hans Schuy, a musi
cal leader of wide reputation, had
a splendidly organized orchestra of
twenty-four pieces including several
talented men from Los Angeles. The
Philadelphia's band was out in force
and an excellent band accompanying
the Hotel-men's delegation volunteered
its services during the procession. Dixie
Thompson, for the first time in two years,
appeared on horseback in public as a vol
unteer aid, riding his valuable blooded
horse, which was exhibited at the Colum
bian Exposition, with his $4000 silver
mounted saddle and silver bridle.
This evening there were receptions in
several of the Santa Barbara homes. The
decorated streets were filled with prome
naders. The event of the evening was the
concert by the Philharmonic Society at
the pavilion, Herr Hans Schuy directing.
HORSE WHIPPED A. DOCTOR.
A San Francisco Woman Creates a Sen-
sation in Eos Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 16.â As Dr.
Granville Macgowan was sitting at a table
in the Creamerie on Broadway this after
noon at lunch along with" many others he
was suddenly attacked by a woman armed
with a horsewhip. The suddenness of the
attack astounded the doctor, but he pulled
the whip from the hands of the infuriated
woman and hustled her out of the place.
The excitement in the place was intense.
The doctor put on his hat, paid his check
and retired to his office. The woman's
name is Mrs. Ella Robison and she has a
room at the Wellington. She is under
stood to have begun divorce proceedings
from her husband in San Francisco. She
is about 34 years of age and a pronounced
brunette. --yr/y. y
The doctor made the following state
ment: "The woman came to my office
about two weeks ago. She was ill and l
prescribed for her several times at inter
vals of two or three days at my office, and
by her request at her room.
"I saw her last about a week ago, when
she stated she was well and would leave
for her home in San Francisco in a day or
two. She thanked me for my kind treat
ment. She paid her fee promptly at each
visit. She stated to me that she' had bad
much trouble with her husband, from
whom she was applying for a divorce, and
ived in constant fear of his injuring net
or her young boy. She seemed queer, and
1 can only account for her actions upon
the ground that she is insane. She nas no
possible grievance against me and I am
satisfied she is crazy."

FIREBUGS AT WORK.
The Gardina Family Has a Narrow
Escape From Cremation.
SAN JOSE. Cai., April 15.â An attempt
was made about 11 o'clock last night to
fire a house at 906 Locust street, near Oak,
occupied by Joe Gardina and family, who
had moved in but a few days ago. En
trance was gained to the cellar and a wood
pile was saturated with benezine and tur
pentine and then lighted. The blaze was
discovered and extinguished before any.
damage was done. Had the fire secured a
good start the Gardina family would have
heen roasted alive.
A house belonging to J. T. Gruwell on
Clay street in East San Jose was destroyed
by fire last night. The loss is $600. The
house was vacant and the fire is supposed
to have been the work of tramps. *.
NEW TO-DAY.
A good, healthy wholesomeness will
make even a homely face attractive.
There are many reasons why women
should take care to be healthy. One
very strong reason is that beauty. and
illness are very seldom found together.
Illness and especially the kind peculiar
to women makes, the complexion bad,
the eyes dull and sunken, the manner
listless and the intellect dull.
No woman in this condition can be at-
tractive to her friends. Personal ap-
pearance counts for much, but comfort
amounts to even more. What's the good
of living if one cannot enjoy anything?
If headaches and backaches and drag-
ging weariness and pain accompany even
slight fatigue? . '.; <;â :â 
If the system is constantly subjected
to a debilitating drain, where is the
energy to come from to make enjoyment
possible ?
Personal comfort and a consideration
for the feelings of others are two of
the incentives to an effort to secure
health. yi'.y:

"Say, are you the Market Inspector?"
an old cripple living at the Almshouse in
quired of Davis, as the latter, accompanied
by Dockery. drove through the big gate
leading into the grounds last Tuesday.
"Yes," answered Davis.
"And your companion is the Milk In

"That's who it is." volunteered the indi
vidual referred to.
"Well, far God's sake go over to the
barn and examine the cows," and with
this parting remark the old fellow hobbled
down the road leading to the City. Later
it was learned that he had been discharged
from the Almshouse because Superintend
ent Weaver thought him able to work for
a living.
It is said that through this discharged
cripple Dockery and Davis first learned
that all was not as it should be in the
barnyard of the County's great charitable
institution. The inspectors reported that
the cows were found to be in bad physical
conditionâ poor, and in many instances
in the. last stages of consumption. The
milk was not only below the standard, but
of a very inferior quality. It was abso
lutely unfit for human food. The result
of these investigations were promptly re
ported to the Beard of Health and pub

On Wednesday Mr. Dockery, assisted by
Market Inspector Davis and Veterinary
Surgeon Creel v, determined to make a
more thorough investigation. Their labors
are not half completed, but enough has
been discovered, they declare, to di ,on

INJECTING TUBERCULES IN THE NECK OF AN ALMSHOUSE COW.
; either tuberculosis or an aegravated form
|of bronchitis. It is said that at least fifteen
! are afflicted with consumption, and will
to-day be killed. Dockery thinKs that
when the test to which the entire herd is
now being subjected is completed not
more than three or four will escape
slaughter. He declares with much earnest
ness that the Almshouse herd of milch
cows is by far the worst he ever encoun
tered, and this opinion is shared in by both
Creely and Davis.
All Wednesday night Dockery and Creely
were on guard to see that none of the
Ttlhj SAJN CISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 17. 1896.
stock was removed from the barn. Yes
terday morning they were joined by Mar
ket Inspector Davis. Creely and Davis
then began the work of injecting into the
neck of each cow a certain quantity of
"tubercolline," a fluid supposed to be in
fallible in detecting the presence of con
sumption. At the end of six hours the
dose is repeated, and then every hour for
the next twelve the temperature of the
animal is taken. If the temperature shows
a steady rise, the existence of tuberculosis
is established beyond doubt.
The time limit ended this morning at 4

THE RELAY RACE CUP.
The Bay City Smoker To-Morrow Night.
. Some Sunday Runs.
There - are no new developments in the
trouble over the late relay race. The Bay
City Wheelmen refuse to give up the cup
without a hearing, the Garden City Cyclers
claim it on a disqualification, and there
the matter stands. No one seems to know
what the next move will be, but whatever
it is it will be awaited with interest.
The California Cycling Club will open
the touring season/ with a run Sunday to
Tocoloma, taking the 8 a. m. Sausalito
ferry and local train to San Anselmo. Cap
tain Mayo expects a large turnout.
The San Francisco Road: Club will have
a . run Sunday under Captain Pixley to
Lake Filarcitos in San Mateo County. To
night is the first anniversary of the club's
existence and it will be appropriately
celebrated at the clubhouse by the mem
bers. Next. Tuesday night at the regular
meeting officers for the , ensuing term will
be nominated. Will J. Allen of Los An
geles, well known , to; nearly every wheel
man on the coast, died in that city the
other day , of consumption. He -. was a
prominent. figure at all -Southern Califor
nia race meets and cycling functions and
was "president of the Los Angeles Wheel
men. He.was the orgiinator of the great
Santa ' Monica road' race, in which Emil
o'clock, but the slaughter will not begin
until later in the day.
Superintendent Weaver Is visibly dis
turbed over the unlooked-for occurrence.
He delares that he can only correct such
evils when his attention is called to them
by those in charge. He said yesterday
that it. was probably true that tuberculosis
existed among the Almshouse cows how
seriously no one could yet determine â but
he declined to become responsible in any
manner or form for the evil. Mr. Weaver
further said that he had not the time to
| attend to all these things, and unless his
| Ulbricht generally manages to win the
time prize every time it is run off.
The. Bay City Wheelmen will hold a
I smoker at the clubhouse, 441 .Golden
Gate avenue, to-morrow evening. To
quote from the ! notice to members
announcing the event: "The idea â¢is
suggested by the cup-winning tendencies
so lorcibly manifested of late by our racing
contingent, and as incidents of a pleasant
nature are still fresh in mind the affair
will, no doubt, be a great success." No
doubt. All Bay City affairs of the kind
invariably are.
W. M. Jenkins, the well-known Southern
California racer, will be . married to Miss
Millie Groff of Los Angeles shortly. The
announcement will ,be a surprise to his
many friends in this City.
L. VV. Fox, who raced here a couple of
years ago and defeated Foster and . other
cracks, left Thursday morning for Alaska
accompanied; by E. E. Gatensbury of.Los ,
Angeles.; They did not take wheels with
them, but will try their speed on snow
sleds and shoes. . v
- The members of the Liberty Cycling
Club are in active training for their road
race, which Â£ takes }. place , over ; the %; San
Carlos course Sunday, and fast time will
undoubtedly be made. .The entries and
handicaps were published exclusively in
The Call Wednesday. *
; The number of evictions in Ireland for
the quarter ending September 1895, was
70. For .the June quarter the number was
174, and for the March quarter 167.
subordinates keep him posted he had no
way of remedying the evil. !
It is said- by the officials that with few
exceptions the entire herd of thirty-four
cows seemed to be on the verge of starva
tion, that morning and noon they were
given as much ground alfalfa as could be
gathered on a three-pronged pitchfork, and
that at night they were . turned out to
"graze" in a field where only rocks and
sticks abound. They declare that there is
not a blade of grass to be seen anywhere
within the inclosure where tlie cows feed.
"I do not pretend to say that Mr.
Weaver has known ,of these things," said
Inspector Dockery yesterday, "but that
does not in any way alter the situation.
The stock here is not half fed. it is not
surprising, therefore," that consumption
once started should make rapid headway."
In ' company with a Call man Mr.
Weaver made a tour of the barn yesterday
afternoon. During the inspection, of the
board a tilt occurred between the superin
tendent'and Kichard Julian, who has
charge of the cows.
"Why don't you mix bran with this al
falfa?" said Weaver.
"Because I haven't got it," answered
Julian. . .' Cy-y
"You have orders to get what you want,
bran and all the alfalfa the stock might
require."
"You know, Mr. Weaver, that you
ordered me to stop feeding bran months
ago. If you wish me to begin again â "
"All right give them all the bran and
everything else they require and see to it
that you carry out my instructions."
Later the superintendent expressed him
self as highly pleased with the work of
Dockery, Davis and Creely.
"I am glad they are doing this thing,"
he said, because I can't attend, to such
matters myself. This man Julian is an
enemy of mine and naturally will do every
thing he can to down me. I know now
there is consumption among the cows, but
if Julian had kept me posted, the disease
would not have spread as far as it has. 1
repeat that this is no fault of mine, and I
feel sure that no sensible person will tnink
otherwise.
"I can refute all the charges that have
been made against me by members of the
Board of Health. At the proper time
next week in factâ Williamson will
present my reply backed up with proof.
When this document is in I think this un
necessary war against me will end.
CARRIE BOWES' SUCCESS
The Young Pianiste Makes a
Decided Hit at the Audi
torium.
1
Shines Especially in a Fantaisie by
Liszt â Flowers and
Applause.
Miss Carrie Bowes, the young California
pianiste who has been studying in Ger
many for the last few years, made her first
professional appearance before a San
Francisco audience. last night at the New
Auditorium. The impression she created
was a. very favorable one. j
Although not out of her teens. Miss
Bowes .showed, herself ,to be possessed of
many of the qualities that make an artist.
Her technique is thoroughly modern; she.
plays without any rigidity of the muscles,
either of the hand or arm, and largely by
that means is enabled to achieve powerful
passages with elasticity and without ap
parent effort. Her technique in passages
requiring delicate and rapid execution is
also very good.
The best work done during the evening
by the debutante was the Liszt "Hungarian
Fantaisie" for piano and orchestra, in
which she played her score with a vigor
and breadth -which were quite surprising
I in a young, girl whose artistic experience
must, on account of her youth; be limited.
Even in the difficult music of the "Fantai
sie" Miss Bowes was independent of notes,
and her confidence was the more remarka
ble as she had only had one rehearsal with
the orchestra. , If she had, leaned on the
latter for support it would have been a lit
tle like leaning on a broken reed.
Miss Bowes did not warm : up over any
of her other numbers as she did over the
Liszt "Fantaisie." Her work, however,
was at times brilliant, and was always sat
isfactory, barring an occasional touch of
slovenliness, which was scarcely percepti
ble out of the Chopin' concerto. In the
Bach "Toccata" in G major she did good
solid work and her playing of Liszt's
"Love Dream" was marked by consider
able poetic feeling. The â¢ pianiste's own
compositions were decidedly pretty and
effective, and if the theme, particularly of
the second one, was not strictly original
the dance was at least a very clever im
provisation/ As an encore "to her own
"Nechischer Tanz" Miss Bowes played a
mazourka by Goddard.
The audience, although not very large,
was enthusiastic, and before the end of tne
concert the platform became literally
banked with floral tributes.
A Forged Transfer.
George Gibblin was accused of trying to pass
a forged transfer last night by Jems W. Jansen,
a conductor on. the Mission-street â¢ tramway
line. He was booked at the City Prison on a
charge of torgery. Gibblin says he received
the fraudulent transfer from" a newsDoy from
whom he he had bought a paper before enter
ing the car at Twenty-second street.

RACING AT BAY DISTRICT
Lumina Took the Rancho Del
\ Paso Stake for Year-
Olds.
ROWENA B WAS SECOND.
Jockey Eddie Jones Injuredâ Sir Play
Beat Bell coso Out Very
Handily.
The California Jockey Club is once more
enjoying a whirl at the racing game. The
Bay District tracK reopened yesterday
with a long and varied programme, and
the gate showed but a slight diminution
in the attendance, notwithstanding the
many departures for the East of late. The
different events were well contested, and
surprises weie numerous, especially in
the overcrowded "dog" races.
The day's sport was somewhat marred
by an accident in the opening race through
which the clever lightweight, Eddie Jones,
suffered a fracture of the collar-bone. The
lad had the mount on Sweet Rose, and
soon after the start there was some bump
ing and jostling, and the filly went down.
Her prostrate rider was trampled upon by
one of the field following immediately be
hind, and the jockey was fortunate indeed
to escape so luckily. . y
â¢ First choices in the betting were first on
three occasions, the other events going to
horses with most remunerative odds laid
against them.
The Rancho del Paso stake for two-year
olds, at five furlongs, worth $1150 . to the
winning horse, was the feature of the card.
The pick of the two-year-old division
started, and the El Primero stables, Lu
mina, a daughter of the dead sire Marten
hurst. captured the prize. Coupled with
her running mate, Fieur de Lis, the win
ning stables' pair were 7 to 5 favorites in
the betting, with the Burns & Waterbouse
entries, Rowena B and King Street, next
in. demand at 13 to o. The winning filly
made all of the running, and in a drive
passed the wire half a length before Ko
wena B, in the fast time, considering the
track, who was not fast, of 1:02. The
fast filly which headed the fourteen start
ers ont is entitled to all praise for her game
run, but there finished a close third a
chestnut gelding named True Blue, against
which the ring at one time laid 100 to 1,
that with anything like a fair ride would
have taken "ail of the coin. Piloted by
Fimngen, an inexperienced stable-boy,
the youngster made a great run through
the stretch, but hampered by the clumsy
movements of his rider had to be content
with third position. ,y , v
Thirteen selling-platers battled for the
$300 purse offered in the opening six-fur
long run. The change in tracks developed
j a startling reversal of form in the case of
i Doubtful, for, showing in front all the
I way, he won easily, four lengths ahead of
Hazel D, another outsider. The winner
I was backed down from 25 to 15 to 1. The
! favorite, Sweet Rose, fell, and Tonino, the
second choice, finished third. . .
A seven-furlong selling affair decided
over the inside course proved a very easy
thing for the \ to 5 choice. Chartreuse 11.
Piggott laid away with the mare until the
stretch way reached, where she drew away
and won easily by four lengths. Sea Spray
took the place, about the same distance in
front of Ike L. -* > -
The 9 to 20 choice, imp. Miss Brummel,
also fell in with some company that were
handily disposed of in the mile selling run
that came next. Leading from the start
she passed the judges before old Service
merely galloping. The distance was cov
ered in I:42>_. Strathflower finished in
the show.
The majority of followers of the "dope
book" figured Beilicoso a good thing for
the fifth event, a six-furlong dash. The
books laid even money . against him
throughout the betting. Piloted by Tod
Sloane he was beaten out easily by Sir
Play, backed down from threes to 7 to 5.
The event following was another chap
ter of misery for the talent, fifteen "crabs"
starting in a five-and-a-half-furlong scram
ble. Crackajack, a2O to 1 shot, won, with
Lelia S, a 10 to 1 chance, second. Taro,
the 2 to 1 favorite, was never heard of, but
was supposed to have finished.
The next round was also a five-and-a
half-furlong set-to, with fourteen "goats"
knocking at the gate. Banjo gained the
referee's decision by a nose in a hot mix
up with Mount Air. The winner went to
the post at 7to 1. Charles A, the 13 to 5
favorite, finished among the "also rans "

FRIDAY APRIL 17. 1896
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
All good Republicans are congratulating
one another.
A pledged delegation is always a ham
pered delegation.
Unless Californians take care of Califor
nia interests who will?
Santa Barbara the beautiful is what we
will have to call her now. ,
After this there will be no question that
honest primaries will be supported by the
people.
The way winter lingers on â¢ the lap of
spring in the East is a clear case of freez
ing to it. /
It is easy to cut a figure in politics, but
not easy to make the figure count for more
than a cipher. "y V
California has certainly been' in the
Union long enough to entitle her to a seat
in the Cabinet.
It was to be expected that theopponents
of pure politics would denounce the results
of pure primaries.
The next administration will put some
California timber into the Cabinet if Cali
fornia insists on it. y. *-\
California men at St. Louis will have to
look out for California interests, and they
should be left free to do it.
California should send to St. Louis a
delegation pledged to any candidate the
convention may nominate.
While the political pot is boiling the
Keliy-Mahoney scum comes to the surface
and can be neatly skimmed off.
San Francisco sunshine seems to have
gone down the coast to attend the fes
tivals, but we may expect it back any day.
Calling the spurious outcome of a bogus
primary a "McKinley ticket" doesn't con
ceal the fraud and doesn't hurt McKinley.
After all their juggling to stuff a ballot
box at a bogus primary, Martin Kelly and
Jerry Mahoney will find there is nothing
in it.
The push and the pull gangs may as
well get out of Republican politics.
The great reform movement goes forward
of itself.
Through the success of the honest prim
aries the way is more open for a clean Re
publican victory in every contest of the
campaign.
If it be decided to send a pledged dele
gation to St. Louis the question as to what
candidate it shall be pledged for will make
more talk.
If Whitney succeeded in getting Cleve
land to say he is not a candidate for a
third term then he did not visit Wash
ington in vain. > ' '?.
A State convention should never attempt
to forestall a National convention in nomi
nating a National candidate or declaring a
National platform. * 'Â£%_
After the fiasco of Tuesday even boss
Rainey won't allow Kelly and Mahoney to
do politics with him any more, unless they
put up something to boot.
Kelly and Mahoney were cunning
enough to put a few honest Republicans
on their bogus tickets, but they are not
strong enough to make them stay there.
Whitney's visit to , Washington , has
caused as much of a flutter among Demo
crat- as if he had put up his barrel in
public view and shown signs of knocking
tbe head in.
A delegation pledged. to any particular
candidate at St. Louis would be regarded
as antagonistic to all others and therefore
would not faithfully represent the Repub
licans of California. ?;y "(y â 
Among the great leaders whom Repub
licans of different sections of the Union
have put forward .as candidates for
the Presidency, The . Call has- no
favorite to the exclusion of others.
It speaks for all. â [[ y: \'dy Âf' l
Lest any one should arise to say The
Call is opposed to Allison, or Reed, or
McKinley, or Morton or any other Repub
lican candidate for the Presidency, we
state beforehand that whoever may say so
will be lying under a mistake or in some
other way.
The Call opens its columns to earnest
Republicans lor a discussion of the advisa
bility of sending a pledged delegation to
St. Louis. It regards the question as the
most important one now before the party
in this State and in its aim to speak for all
desires to give every phase of sentiment on
the subject an opportunity to make itself
known. ' r V.V; ' ' ,-k' "'.*â -.
The Alameda Argus having asserted that
in the funding bill fight "The Call has
deserted the field altogether," has now an
opportunity to write another editorial and
a better one. The Call never deserts any
field where work is to be done for the
people. It is still fighting the funding
scheme, and will- continue .to fie lit until
the victory is won. y' : '^:^l; :
CALIFORNIA AT ST. LOUIS.
Shall California send to: the St. Louis :
convention a pledged or an unpledged
delegation? That question occupies at
this time more or less of the thought of
every earnest Republican. It is right that
this should be so. The question involves
the next important step to be taken in
the campaign ana calls for an immediate
solution., It should, therefore, be dis
cussed at once, and discussed thoroughly,
in order that Republican sentiment may
be crystallized into definite form before the
State Convention meets to take action on
the issue.
The Call favors an unpledged delega
tion on two broad grounds. , First, that
such a delegation would most faithfully
represent the prevailing sentiment of Cali
fornia Republicans. Second, that it would
be more able than a pledged delegation to
advance the interests of California. To
represent the rank and file of the party
and to promote the welfare of the State
are surely considerations that must have
great weight with every loyal Republican
and every true Californian.
It is clear that only an unpledged dele
gation can truly represent all Republicans
of California, because a delegation pledged
to a particular candidate would be antag
onistic to all others and the great mass of
the voters of the party in this State
are not opposed to any one of the illus
trious leaders who have been named as
candidates for the Presidency. It would
be unjust to send to St. Louis a delegation
pledged beforehand to be adverse to the
claims of either Allison, Cullum, McKin
ley, Morton, Reed or any other aspirant.
As the Republicans of the State will loy
ally and enthusiastically support whoever
is nominated at St. Louis, why should
they be put in the attitude of arbitrarily
opposing any man who is likely to be nom
inated?
Equally clear is it that the interests of
California can be advanced by a free and
untrammeled delegation much more ef
fectually than by one bound up by irrevo
cable pledges. Nor are these interests of
little moment. We have seen great works
of public improvement promised by the
National Government to this State de
layed from year to year for lack of a suffi
cient influence with the executive depart
ment of the Government to push-, them
forward. In this City the delayed Post
office building is an illustration of how the
State has suffered from the lack of admin
istration influence, and by citing cases in
other parts of the State it would be easy to
multiply examples.
When, in addition to the improve
ments promised but not carried out, con
sideration is given to such great interests
peculiar to the West as mining, irrigation,
a Hawaiian cable, subsidies to Pacific
Ocean shipping and the improvement of
Pacific Ocean harbors and the great rivers
of .the coast, it will be seen that the issue
is one of the greatest consequence. Cali
fornia should have a representative in the
next Cabinet. Her rank in the Union en
titles her to such an office. She will never
get it, however, if she acts blindly. What
can she profit by a pledged delegation ?
What may she not profit by a delegation
of strong, - brainy, loyal and aggressive
men acting in un trammeled freedom?
The Call urges these arguments with
all the force that springs from a moral
conviction. Sanguine in the faith that it
is right, it calls for a full and free discus
sion of the subject. We invite the whole
Republican press of the State to take it up.
We open our own columns to any earnest
Republican who wishes to be heard on
this issue, so important to all. Let it be
understood then that The Call is opposed
to no particular candidate and favors
none. We are for the Republican party
and the interests of California, and solely
on those grounds we favor an unpledged
delegation that will be loyal to all and
antagonistic to none.
DISGUSTED DELEGATES.
â Well-informed Republicans are not sur
prised to learn that some of the State Con
vention delegates elected at the farcical
primaries held on Tuesday may demand
that their names be stricken from the list.
The contest in the State Convention over
the double set of delegates from the Fourth
and Fifth districts will not be pleasant.
It will be necessary in the interest of
decent politics for the delegates elected
Wednesday at the regular primary to
show how the so-called primary of Tues
day came to be held. This exposure will
uncover a rottenness that will grieve high
minded Republicans, ' but now that the
decks have been cleared for action and
there is a firm determination to destroy
corrupt boesism in the Republican party
of San Francisco, the fight will be made
to the end and the party will emerge all
the better and stronger and cleaner from
the struggle. . ; ' * y â¢'
It will have to be shown that -two noto
rious political manipulators. Kelly and
Mahoney, by forgery and trickery secured
an illegal call from a minority of the Con
gressional Committee for Tuesday's pri
mary; that this gave them a semblance of
standing which deceived a considerable
number of voters; that the manipulators
"fixed" the polls and shamelessly" stuffed
the boxes; that the large body of Repub
licans who understood '-. the situation and
were in favor of purging the party of its
shady bosses remained away; that mean
while the rightful majority of the com
mittee had regularly called a primary for
Wednesday and issued notice -that'
it was the only authorized, regular
and legal election ; that the Republican,
turned out at this election and, by the
overwhelming force -of numbers, : cast
nearly twice as many votes as were stuffed
into the boxes on Tuesday; that Kelly
and Mahoney recognized the legality of
Wednesday's primary by turning out in
force and making an abortive attempt to
defeat the regular ticket by supporting one
of their own manufacture.
These will not be pleasant disclosures at
the ; State Convention, and hence there is
no wonder that the delegates alleged to
have been elected Tuesday are beginning
to appreciate the gravity of their position.
While such secession would give Kelly and
Mahoney an opportunity to furnish substi
tutes on whom they can depend to do their
bidding/ the defection would be seriously
injuring them in a moral sense. ~ This
accounts for the desperate earnestness
with which they are trying to stimulate
the courage of the faltering. ' All of Tues
day's delegates who are not self-confessed
tools of these men .*; and who ' are not
ashamed to be known as such, and who
desire to see the ? Republican party purged
of its corrupt elements and a decent gov
ernment given to San Francisco, should
lose no time in having their names with

CARLISLE'S INCONSISTENCIES.
In his speech at Chicago Thursday even
ing Secretary, Carlisle, while attempting to
prove that the free coinage of silver at the
ratio of 16 to 1 would reduce wages, made
a series of blunders in reasoning that are
so palpable as to raise doubts concerning
his sincerity. The address was particu
larly working people, whom the astute
Secretary possibly thinks are lacking in
the intelligence needed to expose his fal
lacies. That he shrewdly scattered his
contradictory arguments instead of placing
them side by side does not lessen the fact
that they are inconsistent. This is how two
of his assertions look when placed in par
allel columns:
The naked proposi- In the general confu
tion is that the United i sion and disorder re-
States shall coin at the suiting from such a
public expense for the I radical change, what

the depositors of the
bullion and compel all
the other people in the
country to receive these
coins at a valuation of
100 cents each- in the
payment of debts due
them.
That is to say, according to the first of
these assertions the value of _ilver is to be
raised to that of gold, and according to the
second it will remain at its present bullion
value. These positions are manifestly
irreconcilable.
The Secretary further argues that the
free coinage of silver would contract the
currency by placing a premium on gold
and causing its withdrawal from circula
tion, reducing it to a commodity, and yet
he adds: "All the mints of the United
States, operated to their full capacity ana
doing no other work, could not coin into
standard silver dollars two-thirds of the
annual production of silver in our own
country." To an ordinary person this
would seem to suggest an enormous in
crease of a circulating medium rather than
any contraction.
For that matter, the Secretary's unfair- ,
ness and partisanship are patent in his
ignoring of simple methods by which free
coinage would benefit the United States
instead of injuring it. His arguments are
so primitive and have been so often met
that it seems a waste of time to pay any
attention to them. Their only significance
lies in the fact that they are addressed to
workingmen. This class -of Americans
have eloquent evidence of the Democratic
party's devotion to its interest in a tariff
measure that not only reduced wages, but
has actually thrown out of employment
hundreds of thousands of American opera
tives. ' '
MIGHT BE. ENLARGED.
Senator Piatt has introduced a bill that,
judging from the condensed account of it
sent by telegraph, seems good so far as it
goes. It declares" the transmission of news
by any means between States concerning
bets on any event to be a misdemeanor.
The bill might well be amended by adding
a clause prohibiting the importation into
this country of news concerning lottery
drawings j held abroad. This is perfectly
within the scope of Congressional action,
and it would put a stop to one of the
greatest evils under which our people
suffer.
Lotteries are outlawed in the United
States, and those which formerly flourished
here have been driven to the protection of
foreign countries having a moral percep
tion different from ours. Yet they are
working almost as serious harm as when
they flourished on our territory. They
are enabled to do this by the fact that
newspapers not governed by the highest
sense of duty and patriotism publish the
list of drawings at these lotteries, giving
flaming prominence to the prizes alleged
to have been won by American ticket
holders. This serves as a lure which the
avaricious and ignorant are unable to
resist, and the consequence is a heavy,
drain on the money of the people, coming
mostly from those least able to bear it.
These concerns are barefaced swindles,
far worse than when they were conducted
in this country. Congress has the power
fo" prohibit the introduction into the
United States of news concerning them,
just as it has the power to prohibit ;the
introduction of contagious diseases or the
importation of paupers. Already there is
an admirable statute prohibiting the
transmission of lottery matter through the
mails. The scheme of prohibition would
be complete if the introduction of news
concerning foreign lotteries was prohib
ited. The law could recognize the publi
cation of drawing-lists as prima facie evi
dence of such introduction, and include
publication as a part of the offense. Such
a law as this would save hundreds of thou
sands of dollars annually to California,
some of whose leading newspapers publish
monthly flamboyant advertisements of
these swindling concerns.
INSTRUCT NOT.
Wheatland Four Corners.
The theory of representative government
does not imply that the people's representa
tives must be instructed to vote thus and so on
propositions as they arise; in other words that
they are to be deprived of the use of their
brains and their judgment In the best interest
of the people they represent and directed to
vote and talk like automatic machines. A rep
resentative in the legislative halls or in politi
cal conventions should be clothed first of all
with discretionary powers and be at full lib
erty, to use his voice and vote as seems best at
all times and occasions. Anything short of
this is abortive of true representative func
tion, and also belittles the character and care
fulness of the representative. It is well enough
and in fact Important for the people in dele
gating assemblies to go on record as to their
desires concerning public =â â¢ issues, and the
record should show those desires in unmistak
able language. Delegates chosen from those
assemblies must in honor note the record and
conduct themselves accordingly, , but they
should be free to carry out the will of the as
sembly choosing them in such a way as to
come nearest accomplishing the purpose .
Much as any may dislike to say it, all must
admit that our Government in its legislative,
judicial and party make-up is a Government
brought Into being by compromises. Factions
fight lor this and for that, and they could
never agree except upon a compromise basis.
Now suppose ; we send : delegates to St. Louis
and Chicago with unalterable instructions
about silver. The result would, undoubtedly
be. to tie their hands and thus leave California
practically unrepresented. . But suppose we
send those delegates uninstructed, or rather to
represent us on silver and all other matters
according to the memorials of the respective
delegating convention? What then? Cali
fornia will take first rank among the States
and our delegates become ! a power from the
first. An honest delegate needs no command
ing Instructions, and no other kind of dele
gates should be chosen. -

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Colonel J.B.Lowe, the mine manager and
expert, who for years owned interests at Vir
ginia City and elsewhere, strolled into, the
Palace a day or two ago; and soon was shaking
hands and talking with a number of young
and elderly mining men there.
The colonel is known as the expert for the
Flood & O'Brien people. He is also the in
ventor of the streetcar seen here and else
where, which is closed or open, according Sto
the state of the weather.
He was asked that question which has per
turbed the minds of mining men for a long
while, viz., the best place to go to mine.
"They can all do as they please," said the
colonel, "and those who want to go to Cool
gardie, Cripple Creek or Kootenai can do so;
but as for me, I think I'll stay right here in
California. y . , :y y
"I sold out all my interests in the Comstock

about eight years ago, and since then haven't
owned much there. The last thing I investi
gated was the Brunswick lode, and I found
there the only large vein that promised any
thing that wasn't already punched full of
holes. I really thought that gave indications
of turning out something. I think they stand
a good show of getting some ore there.
"But, now, you contrast California mines
with the various outside camps you hear
about and then think of the advantages
here over the outside places. The com
parison is so much in favor of California
that I wonder why men will be persuaded to
leave here and go wandering off to the remote
and inhospitable places of the earth. There is
no need of it.
"Take California as a whole and it is the fin
est land under the sun to mine in. Over a
large area one may work winter and summer
uninterrupted by snow or heat, and when he
gets tired he can jump on a railroad train
and reach San Francisco, the greatest city of
the West, in a few hours' time. It is great.
There is nothing like it.
"Then this is aland of plenty. A man can
live like a fighting cock all the time, and be
doesn't have to pay four or five prices for every
thing either. .
"Verily we are the people. There ls nobody
in it like us, and I am astonished that any man
once here will continue to wander, unless it is
to illustrate the old adage that 'far away birds
have fine feathers.' The man who is here had
better stay. He is in it. There is only one
California. A man might go away off, to Koo
tenai for instance, and probably it's a pretty
good rising country, too, but think of the
weather, the distance and the isolation. It's
tough to think about. It's worse in some of
the other places. Let me be grateful that I
know a good thing when I see it and am satis
fied. "

GROVER AS A HOODOO.
â¢ If the members of the communism of pelf go
to Chicago in July to secure the nomination of
Cleveland they will be compelled to camp out
in Lake Park, for there will not be a hotel
man in Chicago courageous enough to enter
tain them, "-vy* 'â â 'â -â¢
It was at the swell Richelieu Hotel that the
members of the communism of pelf "stayed
during the convention of 1892, and there the
schemes were j laid by > which the Territorial
delegates were bought for Cleveland with
Standard Oil and ''reform" money. The dele
gates to the convention in , 1892 must he \ re
minded of this by the Supreme ' Court . decree
just handed down in the foreclosure proceed
ings against the Richelieu Hotel Company
brought by the bondholders. The doors will
be closed in ten days and the property sold in
three weeks. The Richelieu Hotel, like every
thing else in any way connected with the last
Democratic campaign, has been "profoundly
touched" iby the finger of fate. It has suc
cumbed to the Cleveland Hoodoo.
. The Cleveland hoodoo is not a joke. It is a
grim reality to those who have suffered by it.
Bee what it has done. Chicago, as the conven
tion city, paid most of the bills of the conven
tion which nominated Cleveland. Chicago
was the first city shaken by the financial panic
a few months after he was inaugurated. It was
in Chicago that the first runs upon the banks
occurred. Chicago's Mayor was assassinated
by a crank, its treasury, became bankrupt,
thieves and thugs caused a reign of terror and
the Democratic party went to smash. If there
is any way in : which' Chicago hasn't suffe-ed
since Cleveland was inaugurated there is still
time for new terrors before the 4th of March
brings its four years in purgatory to a close.
In New York the Victoria Hotel, where
Cleveland always stopped when in the city
during his campaign, failed last year, and has
been closed. The Democratic Manhattan Club,
which entertained him after his Madison
square speech of acceptance and tangled ;
Adlai's legs with its punch, is all over in debt,
and has lost much of its membership because
Grover made it impossible for many of Its
members to meet their dues. Tammany, which
unwillingly supported Cleveland, has been
ripped up the back, and Croker, the go
between, spends most of his time in England
because .New York is no longer safe or con
genial.
These are but a few of the incidents in the
chapter of calamities which men and things
connected with the last Cleveland campaign
have suffered, but they are sufficient to show
that the Grover hoodoo is no joke.

OF IMPORTANCE TO POPULISTS.

We again desire to call the attention of Pop
ulists throughout the Pacific Coast to the lib

Call is devoting space to the free expression j
of the views of able reform writers in ; its col- 1
umns. - While The Call is thoroughly Repub- \

minded variety so noticeable in other leading
dailies. We have published some of these artx
cles from the pen of Joseph Asbury Johnson,
one of the brainiest reform writers on the
coast, but our space precludes the publication
of many others which we are anxious our
readers should peruse.
Should The Call continue its liberal course
during the present campaign we would advise
Populists generally to take that paper in pref
erence to others possessed of less liberality.
We have not noticed the Weekly Call to as
certain whether these articles appear in it or
not, but, if they do, Populists in the country,
who are so situated as to be unable to take a
daily paper should give their preference to the
Weekly Call, and thus not only enable them

BIG GUNS THAT ARE USELESS.
The work of dismantling the old batteries at
the military posts around San Francisco is
progressing slowly. As the big guns are taken
from the rotten old carriages they are piled
together to wait for purchasers, as they bave
been ordered "sold for old metal." y; â¢
But so far purchasers have not materialized,
and the outlook is that they will notâ at least
until gun-metal becomes more valuable than
at present. As things are it is impossible to
give the old cannons away. Nobody wants
them, because the work of getting them to a
blast-furnace would cost more than the goods
they could be manufactured into would sell
fpr. So the chances are they will remain
where they are until the Government starts a
gun plant of its own on the Pacific Coast.
These guns are really as good as when they
were put on top of the hills away back in 1863.
They can shoot as well as they ever could, but
the trouble is they, cannot do as much

damage to a modern warship as they could to
one of the old-time frigates. In fact they
would do no more harm to a vessel like the
Monterey than a hunter could with a good
sized fowling-piece. As weapons of defense or
offense they are not worth 5 cents.
These guns are all of the old-time pattern
cast like a stove-lid by pouring the melted
metal into the mold and yet they cost the
people of the United States between $4000 and
$0000 apleee. The cost of placing them in
position was at least $1000 apiece, so that the
average price was about $5500 for each gun.
There are 250 of these discarded guns at
Benicia. 200 at Alcatraz and the Presidio and
50 at Angel Islandâ in all about 500. At the
cost mentioned, with transportation expenses
and carriages added, the total would be at
least $3,000,000. Not one of these guns has
ever fired a hostile shot and many have never
had any powder in them. But they have ac
complished a great deal of good in the way of
"persuading" enemies to keep away, so they
have done their duty and earned every cent
that they cost. . â¢
The new guns that are intended to replace
the old ones will represent a cost of at least
$20,000,000. _^

Sanatoriumâ E. F. H., City. Sanatarium and

Both aro derived from the Latin sanare, to
heal, sanatory properly signifies conducive to
health, and is applied to curative measures
after health is lost, while sanitary has the more
general sense of pertaining to health and is
applied to preventive measures. A sanatorium
is a place where people go for the sake of
health or to regain health, usually a private
hospital for the treatment of patients who aro
not beyond the hope of cure.

THE BLAIRMORE INQUIRY
Second Mate McDonald Contra
dicts Captain Caw's Tes
timony.
SHE WAS A "TENDER" VESSEL.
A Sea Voysge With noo Tons of
Ballastâ Fears of the Officers
and Crew.
The inauiry into the loss of the ship
Blairmore was begun at the British Con
sulate yesterday morning at 10 o'clock,
before Vice-Consul W. . G. Moore and Cap
tains Edmund England and F. W. Harvey.
Captain Caw, the first, witness, told of his
abiding faith in the stiff qualities of his
ship and his disregard of the puffing gale
that blew her over. His reason for the
disaster was that the vessel surged ahead
over her anchor and tripped on the forty
five fathoms of chain that was out. The
wind and tide throwing her against this
chain that half encircled her rolled her
over.
All of the other witnesses, except Second
Mate McDonald, gave testimony tending
to show that they did not consider the
vessel in any serious danger. Mc-
Donald was one of the escapes from the
lower hold of the Blairmore on the morn
ing of the fatal April 9, and he is still on a
crutch with a wounded foot from the
catastrophe. He was strong in his opinion
that the ship was cranky and unsafe from
her empty condition and that almost all
the crew had discussed her "tender" ac
tions in the gale and were afraid. He had
aiseussed the vessel with his brother offic
ers â Third Officer Melville, who escaped
with him from the sinking hull, and First
Mate Ludgate, whose body is entombed in
the lost vessel. Captain Caw testified tbat
there were 40 tons of coal in the forepart,
but McDonald insisted that there Â«ould
not have been more than 15 tons.
Altogether this officer was a bad witness
for the skipper fighting hard for his cer
tificate. :'â :*â¢.!
Captain Caw upon being sworn stated
that the vessel was built at McMillan's
yard, Dumbarton, with steel hull, masts
and yards, and full rigged with stump top
gallant masts. He had been in command
of her ever since her launching, two and a
half years ago. She had come to this port
from Newcastle, Australia, with 2932 tons
of coal. Her register was 1767 tons.
"After discharging the cargo here," said
he, "I took in about 260 English tons of
rock and dirt ballast. By the draught of
the ship I knew we had considerable in
excess of that. It was stowed in the after
Fart of the main hatch and could not shift,
bad also forty tons of coal in the fore
peak. All the water-tanks were full, mak
ing an added weight of about twenty tons.
When we left the wharf she drew" about
eleven feet six inches forward and about
eight feet four inches aft. She always be
haved at sea as she behaved in ballast, and
it took very little power to careen her up
to a limit. After that she would go no
further unless under great pressure.
"I never used extra precautions and
never had more than 200 tons of ballast in
her at one time in port. I never con
sidered her 'tender,' but as stiff as any
vessel of her build. In the gaie of the
morning of April 9, when across the wind
and tide, she lay over only ten degrees.
Nobody warned me or notified me that
they thought the ship unsafe. I was
aboard all that night and did not consider
that there was danger. There was one
anchor down with lorty-five fothoms of
chain. The ship had no list and there
was no trimming of ballast. I am not
aware that any of the men came on deck
frightened."
In answer to a question as to why the
men were put to work with the vessel ca
reening under the force of the brisk
southwester he answered that he did not
apprehend any danger, and the mate took
them down into the hold after breakiast,
I as was usual.
"The ship went over ar 6:45," continued
Captain Caw, "while she was heading
west-nor'west. The tide was one-hour
flood, running three or four knots. There
were heavy showers of rain and strong
southwest squalls. The only opinion I
can give of the disaster is that the chain
got under her bottom and it tripped her.
Two of the men that were lost were on
deck. My certificate of competency went
down in the ship. No tugboat offered its
services to me on the morning of April 9,
and there was no effort made by any one
to rescure the men imprisoned in the hull
except the efforts of some Union Iron
Works people who cut a hole in the hull.
I never took any extra precautions with
the Blairmore, and always considered her
a safe, stiff ship."
Third Officer Melville's testimony dis
closed nothing new except that he dis
agreed with his captain and thought the
snip was a little cranky. .
Second Officer McDonald, whose testi
mony will go farther in wrecking tne skip
per's marine standing, hobbled into the
room and was sworn.
"I have heen nine years at sea," said he,
"and a mate for thirty-three months. The
Blairmore was cranky at sea, and we had
tone careful in carrying sail in. squally
weather. On the passage from Rio to
Newcastle we carried 1100 tons of ballast."
This statement is remarkable, consider
ing that Captain Caw testified, that he
never felt the 200 or 300 tons was too little
to hold the vessel on an even keel.
"The ship was cranky always," con
tinued the witness, "when the wind was
uusteady. I think 250 or 300 tons of bal
last was in her when she went over, also
nearly twenty tons of coal. The ship was
very heavily sparred, and during the gale
of April 9 she heeled over considerably.
The wind was off shore, but she could ride
head on to it on account of the tide.
"I was alarmed all the time for her
safety, but did not speak to the captain
about it. I spoke to . the mate, however,
and he was as frightened as I, was. We
joked about it." !
When asked why he joked about so seri
ous a matter, witness answered that he did
regard it as a serious matter, but there was
no use to talk to Captain Caw about it
as he would not put in any more ballast to
quiet anybody's fears. He probably joked
to keep his courage up.
"She heeled over a good bit at 4 o'clock,"
BaUl McDonald, "and we were awakened
by the rolling. We turned out alarmed,
and we three mates talked the matter over.
I turned in again, but was on the lookout
and thought I would escape if anything
happened. We ' went down in the hold
after breakfast and was at work scraping
paintwork when she went over. She first
gave a lurch and we looked to see if. she'd
come back, but she did not. I hurt mv
foot in escaping through the main i hatch.
"I don't think there was enough ballast
in her, and I think Captain Caw was at
fault in sending the men below at that
time* The captain and I had haa a little
trouble over matters aboard the ship. I
and others aboard were afraid to stay in
the vessel. 1 There was - not much more
than fifteen tons of coal aboard."
Captain J. W. Morrell of the British
ship Verejean testified that his ship was
also built at McMillan's yard. He con
sidered the Blairmore "tender." but had
no right to consider her dangerous, as he
thought her captain understood her. He
testified that the gale blowing on the
morning of April 9 was enough to; heel
over any vessel, even when well- stiffened.
Any stranger is liable to err, especially in
the winds of San Francisco Bay.
Several.of 'the; apprentice boys and the
carpenter testified to the wind and the be
havior of the ship at the time of the acci
dent. The inquiry will _be resumed this
morning at 10 o'clock. ?;!::!-' yVij;

Captain Eustel of the Ship Hawaiian
Isles Is an Enthusiastic
Bicyclist.
Fast trips are now the rule, but the City
of Papeete, which got in from Tahiti yes
terday, did not especially distinguish her
self. She covered the distance in thirty
four days and Captain Berude is satisfied. i
He does not believe in hurrying the craft, I
and when it begins to blow a little he
takes in sail and jogs along in order that j
his passengers may be able to take their j
meals in peace and quietness.
The City of Papeete is a handsome craft
and one of the smartest barkentines that
enters the Golden Gate. Strange to say,
she never manages to make a fast passage,
but then the master is never in a hurry,
and that may account for the delay. In
passing between the islands of Oahu and
Hawaii the Papeete had her only adven- !
ture. A squall struck her and before she
could recover several sails were carried |
away. Captain Berude reports that when
he left Tahiti the French bark Colbert was I
in port and was loading for Bordeaux. j
The Norwegian bark Soret, from Valpa
raiso, ana the British bark Isabella, from
Flint Island, were also in port. The latter
were also to load for Europe.
Among the passengers of the Papeete
were Mr. and Mrs. Berton and family and
Mr. and Mrs. F. Jollivett and family." They
are all on their way to France to spend a
well-earned vacation.

in both Australia and England vessels a>-e
loading for those points. The big ship
Hawaiian Isles was chartered to load on
( the Sound for New. South Wales, but as
i two vessels were here with unsold cargoes
it was decided to put the lumber into her
here. The barkentine Uncle John and the
; schooner Sparrow accordingly went along
side of her and- unloaded: into the ship.
There was not near enough, however to
fill the big vessel, so she will go from here
. to Port Blakeley to finish loading.
I Captain Kustel of the Hawaiian Isles is
j a noted bicyclist. His wife and daughter
| vie with him in the sport, and it is whis
: pered that Mrs. Kustel is the better rider
ofthe two. Miss "Trotie" Kustel is also a.
: good rider, and as all three have their
. bikes with them, the Australians will be
i treated to an exhibition of skillful riding
; when the Hawaiian Isles reaches Sydney*
It is said along the front that during the
voyage Captain Kustel will have the decks
cleared for action every, morning, and that
he and his wife and daughter will take a
spin before breakfast.

. The new steamer President of the Alaska
Packers' Association line went out on her
trial trip yesterday. There were over fifty
guests on board, but as the vessel went
outside the heads quite a number of them
did net enjoy that part of the run. Cap
tain S. J. Ruddell and W. H. Thornley
were among those who paid their respects
to the fishes, but nevertheless when the
vessel docked they were ready to swear it
was the most pleasant trip they ever made.
The President behaved splendidly, the
machinery was in perfect working order
and the excursion was a success. â¢
The schooner Bonanza is in trouble.
Lately she was put on the drydock and
overhauled. â¢ A good job was made of her,
and then she was loaded for a trading
cruise to the Arctic, and Captain James
Tilton took command. He was formerly
master of the whaling bark Andrew HicKs,
so he had a whaleboat put aboard in the
hones that one of the leviathans might
cross his path during the cruise. The
cargo was all aboard aid everything in
readiness when yesterday it was discov
ered that the schooner was leaking at the
rate of two inches an hour. The water is
easily kept down, and as it is thought to
be only a spike hole 1 ft by a calker the
schooner will to to sea and the crew will
keep ti.e water out with the pumps until
the wood swells enough to close the leak.
Sailors are very scarce on the water
front, and captains are finding it difficult
to man their ships when ready for sea.
Full prices are now being paid, and some
of the boarding-masters are openly stating
that there will be a return to "blood
money inside of two weeks. The rush to
Alaska has taken away a great many
A. B.s, and the unusual' number of coast
ers now in commission have taken away
all the surplus men, and deep-water ships
cannot get a full complement. The John
McDonald is ready to sail for Honolulu,
but as the captain will only give a $25 ad
vance, and the men demand $35, there is a
deadlock. Other vessels are in the same
predicament, and it is only a question of a
few days when rates will advance.
Tne first installment of pillars for the
new ferry building were delivered by the
Risdon Iron Works yesterday. The cast
ings are now being rushed and inside of a
week the work of" construction will have
begun in earnest.
The steamer Areata sails to-day on the
South Coast's rim to Eureka and way
ports. latter could not carry all. the
freight offering at the low rates, so a larger
vessel had to be put on. The Alice Blan
chard and Empire are still in opposition.
The fight is getting very lively and an
other cut in rates may be. expected at any
time.

RESULTS OF LOW FARES
The Matter as Viewed From the
Standpoint of the Rail
road People.
TRANSFERS WOULD HAVE TO GO
A Fare Might Be Charged on Every
Line Operated Under a Separate
Franchise.
Despite the expectation of President C.
F. Crocker of the Market-street Railway
Company that the matter of a three-cent
fare would come up for discussion at the
annual meeting of the stockholders of the
company such was not the case, according
to the authority of the same gentleman.
The meeting was held yesterday, when the
following hoard of directors was elected:
Charles F. Crocker, H. E. Huntington, A.
Hayward, W. J. Adams, Charles G. La
throp, Charles Holbrook, F. S. Douty, N.
T. Smith and J. L. Willcutt.
The only change is the election of
Charles Holbrook of Holbrook, Merrill &
Stetson as a director in place of M. D.
Stein, the former general manager of the
company. The election of officers will
take place to-day.
Speaking of the propositions of the Rail
road Commissioners to reduce the street
car fares to three cents an attorney promi
nent as a Southern Pacific counselor said
yesterday that there was nothing in the
constitution giving the Commissioners ju
risdiction over streetcar lines, and that all
the phraseology of th- constitution defin
ing the powers of the board showed that it
was not the intention of the framers of the
constitution to place the regulation of the
streetcars in the hands ot the Commis
sioners. He said: Â . -y
"Why, they might just as well try, to
regulate the chutes near the park. They
transport passengers, yet no one dreams
of placing them under control of the Rail
road Commissioners. ~=y/i*\>4y.-^ ;ii
"But assuming that the Commissioners
have the right to regulate the fares on
streetcars they mus. adopt a uniform
basis for every streetcar line in the State,
and this would virtually place the one
horse arrangements . on the same level
with the most improved electric lines.
"Then. there is another view to take of
the matter, looking at it from the stand
point of the streetcar patrons. Would
they really be benefited by a 3-cent fare?
Such a reduction would, of course, do away
with the entire system of transfers, and
each j road would then charge the 3-cent
fare over its line.- Now the Market-street
Railway Company's lines comprise a large
number of roads operating under separate
franchises â a â  score or more â and there
would be nothing to prevent each road
charging a separate fare.
"The Market-street line proper runs
alons Market street to where it joins Val
encia, then along the latter to where it
joins Mission. | This ride could be j taken
all right for one - fare.' But say a person
wished to go to the park from the ferry.
He would, then have to take either the
Haight. Hayes, or McAllister street line.
Each of these are operated under a separate
franchise, and consequently an additional
fare would be charged on each of them,
and so on each of the lines which in con
junction with others of the Market-street
line now afford a continuous passage by
means of transfers for 5 cents, the charge
would | be 6 â  cents j and : in gjj some cases
three fares would probably be charged. ; â¢
â  When this phase of ..the situation was
called to the attention of President Crocker
he said the matter had not been considered.
"But," he added, there are great possibili
ties."
NEW POLITICAL THEORY
An Economist Who Advocates
Intelligence as a Voting
Qualification.
ONLY STATESMEN ELIGIBLE.
He Would Have Political Beards of
Education Issue Certificates of
Competency to Govern.
Peter 0. Wiese does not believe that a
man should be allowed to vote until he
has passed a critical examination and has
received a certificate of competency.
In order that others may thin as he
does Mr. Wiese has had published at con
siderable expense a pamphlet setting forth
the reasons why an ignorant man should
not have any part in the affairs of govern
ment. The pamphlet consists of twelve
pages with an illuminated title cover in
which two gentlemen, one with a silk hat
and a many-colored overcoat, and the
other with a derby hat, lemon yellow
pants and a sack coat of dingy brick hue,
are flirting with two women on the street.
The ladies are as loudly dresred as the
men and are looking at the pair of mash
ers behind jihem. This interesting picture
is entitled, "Thought for the times;
voters at the polls explains the root and
remedy for the general depression in busi
ness." ii
There are several other funny pictures
in the book in black and white. In one of
these the Legislature is represented in ses
sion and labeled "Obedient servants of the
King" ; on the other side is a politician
addressing the meeting. One of his ad
vancing hearers is saying, "He's a great
man; he says big things"; and another,
"Begorra, phat is he saying?"
The following extracts will show the
scope of the work:
It is therefore high time that an educational
standard of political knowledge must be had,
without which no one should vote. The voter
should have sufficient knowledge of politics to
know what is required for the greatest pros
perity for all legitimate business, and should
understand, the importance of educating and
elevating the minds of the young in our com
mon schools so that they may make noble men
and women. Then a fair field for all, rich and
poor, would soon be seen, all industrious peo
ple would be able to accumulate.
To establish this there should be boards of
education throughout the country to examine
those who aspire to the responsibility of vot
ing, and qualify the voter by a certificate like
a schoolteacher is qualified to teach, and there
would be no fools to fool iv politics.
To prove the necessity for draw a line be
tween Intelligence and ignorance look over the
country and behold the kind of people that the
poorest half of the common laborers are, and
you will find that they would not do a day's
work ii they could get food and shelter with
out, no matter how poor that might be. They
have not sense enough to be ambitious, and are
contented merely to live.
Go into a railroad camp or any other place
where a large number of men are employed
and any foreman will tell you that if they al
lowed their men to lay off all they wanted to
half of them would not work at ah. And still
these men who do not know how to provide for
themselves, but must be driven by others, are
vested with power to regulate the management
of public affairs.
Is it not ridiculous that the high-spirited
and intelligent American people "should be
governed by fools? ; >: t
There is a picture of a farmer holding
the plow, his hired man prying out a
stump with a crowbar and his son and
daughter driving two cows to church.
The title of this picture is "Good people to
work and .manage their private affairs,
but know not how to govern a nation."
Another picture represents the two
mashers engaged in conversation with the
two ladies of the title-page. On the other
side are three tramps in front of a saloon.
The title is "People in Politics To-day."
The author's remedy is simple, but it is
hardly likely to be carried | into effect, for
missionaries are sent to pagans, never to
fools. He concludes:
It is therefore to be hoped that all intelli
gent people may soon organize throughout the
country for the purpose of forcing a National
law to be passed that shall distranchise every
man who can be fooled in politics and enfran
chise every woman who cannot be fooled.
And when that is done prosperity to the
American people, both rich and poor, will be
on safe footing, and not before.
It is of no use for people who do not under
stand politics to organize, for they are entirely
helpless before their intelligent superior. All
they can do is to strike like striking their fist
in the air and hit nothing, but straining them
selves. It takes the intelligent people in the
country, and ull ot them, too, to provide pros
perity to business so that no one need go idle,
and by which good wages will be the natural
consequence. And until they organize and
strike with their intellectual power all fools
may strike and be fooled, no matter how great
they are in number, for you can make one fool
kill the other.
The Body Identified.
The "body that was taken from the bay at the
foot of Pacific street on Wednesday morning
was yesterday identified as that of H. Hansen,
a seaman, aged 55 years, who formerly lived at
the Capital House on Sacramento street. He
was in arrears. in his rent and was forced to
give up his room. .' He told A. Halverson of 116
Jackson street that he intended to commit sui
cide and outlined the point in the bay where
his body would be found. Hansen dabbled in
stocks some years ago and lost quite heavily.

HAYNE ENTERS
STRONG PROTESTS
He Argues Against Courts!
Intervening to Fix
Rates.
CITES MANY DECISIONS.
Railroad Commissioners Have the
Right to Regulate Transpor
tation Charges.
SOME OBJECTIONS ARE RAISED.
Limitations on the Right of Assign
ing a Tariff of Fees for
Carriers.
The usual galaxy of legal luminaries as
sembled yesterday in the United States
Circuit Court room to hear Attorney. Hayne
continue his argument in the Southern
Pacific case. Pillsbury, venerable, pa
triarchal, but withal wary and watchful;
Garber, genial and smiling, albeit some
times sarcastic; Herrin, suave and silent,
but observantâ all were on hand to witness
Hayne's assaults upon the contentions
with which they had thought to fortify
themselves. His Honor Judge McKenna,
though sedate and stately, was likewise an
attentive listener, and disdained not oc
casionally to grant the pleader a quiet and
decorous smile as some important point
was scored or some unusually vivid gem
of word-painting submitted to his approv
ing notice.
Mr. Hayne commenced by citing a great
number of decisions, which he considered
to have a bearing on the case at bar. The
number of citations was so overwhelming
that the Judge at length entered a gentle
protest.
"I must beg your Honor to let me keep
to the order which I have marked out for
myself," said Mr. Hayne.. "I don't want
to be run off the track ; and if I think it
necessary I ought to be allowed to read
and cite any number of cases in support of
my position. yCjy'y
"Now, why should the courts intervene
when we have a Railway Commission en
dowed with the right to fix rates of
transportation?"
' "Then," interposed Mr. Garber, "you
wish to infer that the action of the Rail
way Commission is conclusive?"
"That's another question," rejoined Mr.
Hayne, "and when it comes up we can
give it our attention."
"But what I want to know." persisted
Mr. Garber. "is whether you conceive the
court to Pave no right to revise the find
ings of the Railway Commission."
"I contend," answered Mr. Hayne,
"that when the law has assigned the fix
ing of rates to a certain tribunal, created
for that and kindred purposes, the courts,
ordinarily speaking, are not supposed to
discharge those functions."
"Well," observed Mr. Garber, "that is a
statement of your position, is it?"
"I must request," said Judge McKenna.
who for some minutes had been exercising
the judicial knuckles upon his desk in a
vain endeavor to stop the discussion, "that
there be no further interruption," and Mr.
Hayne resumed the thread of his argu
ment so often broken.
"I wish," he continued, "to call atten
tion to two principles; one, that when the
supreme authority confines the fixing of
rates or any other matter of public in
terest to one determined tribunal, the
courts have, generally speaking, no right
to interfere; the other, that if that tribunal
be the Legislature or . a body created by
legislative enactment, then its acts, so far
as the courts are concerned, should be con
sidered conclusive. That is to say, conclu
sive as long as the special tribunal keeps
within the lines laid down for it by the
authority which created it."
"Why couldn't the State intervene to
reduce rates that are considered too high?"
asked Mr. Garber.
"Is that your position?" asked . Mr.
Hayne.
"I am not stating my position," re
joined Mr. Garber. "I merely asked what
objection you could find to an interven
tion on the part of the State, having for
its object the reduction of railway rates."
The Judge again interposed, and a brief
conference ensued as to the power prop
erly endowed with the right to pass upon
the matter of rates and their regulation.
"Bear with me now, in what I am about
to say," pleaded Mr. Hayne; "but I want
to Â»sk whether your Honor can substitute
your own judgment for that of the tribu
nal to which the supreme governing power
of the Nation has confided the matter of
adjudicating upon the fairness of railway
transportation rates. In countries where
the common law prevails the Legislature
is usually authorized to pronounce upon
the reasonableness of these rates; and, in
fact, does in many instances fix a maxi
mum rate beyond which transportation
companies may not go. That, it "seems to
me. should be the status of the matter in
this State." -y
Mr. Hayne then proceeded to cite a de
cision of Chief Justice Waite in a case re
ported in 116 United States Reports, to
the effect that the power of regulating
railway rates had its limitations and that
the right of limiting rates could not law
fully be used for the spoliation or prac
tical confiscation of any railway or other
transportation agency. His main conten
tion throughout the day's argument was
that the courts should not enter into any
consideration of the matter of the reason
ableness of transportation rates unless it
became apparent that the rates fixed by
the Railway Commission were so unreason
ably high as to be an imposition upon the
public, or so unreasonably low as to de
stroy the value ofthe property owned and
operated by any individual or corporation
for railway or other transportation pur
poses.
Before the court adjourned Mr. Hayne
read the titles of a large number of cases,
some of which had been decided in the
Supreme Court of the United States, and
which, he contended, were binding upon
the couft in the present action.
MONEY IN TREES.
_ What John Beard Made Out of a Little
Forest of Locusts.
An industry which might be made prof
itable in the region bordering the bay of
San Francisco seems to have been over
looked and neglected by the farmers. As
an example of how money can be made in
planting trees, Senator John Beard of Ala
meda County related this incident: "Some
ten years ago I took a fancy to set out
about a quarter of an acre in locust trees.
I did not pay much J attention to the trees,
but observed from time to time that they
seemed to be thriving and making quite a
little forest. Last season I was talking
with a sea captain, and he spoke of the
difficulty of getting locust-pins or trunnels
for ship's timbers. At tirst 1 thought noth
ing of the conversation, but a few days
afterward it occurred to me that the little
forest which I had planted might be util
ized, and so I mentioned the subject to the
captain. He did not want any tree less
than six inches in diameter, but found
plenty of trees of that dimension in my
forest. In this transaction I got $648 for
the locusts from the ship-builder and had
thirty cords of wood for use."
"The locust tree," said Senator Beard,
"will thrive in the little canyons. Again,
I have noticed that the English oak really
does better in California than in England.
It grows to a large size, and seems to at
tain remarkable strength and vigor. A
great deal of cood might be done for this
State by promoting tree culture. The im
portant work hitherto laid out in this
direction by the State Board of Forestry
was neglected or mismanaged. Tho de
struction of the chestnut oak now going
on is alarming. The bark is used for
tanning purposes, and to get it the trees
are stripped and killed."
FOR CITY IMPROVEMENTS.
The Merchants' Association Desirous of
Furthering Progressive Measures.
At a meeting of the board of directors of
the Merchants' Association yesterday the
following were present : W. G. Doane, A.
Fusenot, Hugo D. Keil, M. S. Kohl berg,
Henry Michaels, R. F. Osborn, Joseph
Simonson, Frank Swain, Vanderlynn Stow
and Joseph T. Terry.
It was decided to accept the invitation of
the Street Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors to be present at the meeting on
the _3d inst. Specifications for the new
fiscal year will then be considered, and the
association will present some suggestions
based upon past experience.
In accordance with the action of the
special meeting of the association" efforts
will be made to secure the sprinkling of
the streets uniformly and systematically
by the City during the next fiscal year. It
was decided to request the Board of Su
pervisors to provide in the next tax levy a
sufficient amount to repave the downtown
cobbled blocks with noiseless pavement.
Owing to the depleted funds in the Street
Department this work cannot be done
during the remainder of the present fiscal
year.
Negotiations are now pending with the
Park Commissioners whereby the street
sweepings, so valuable to the improve
ment of the park, will be carried to Golden
Gate Park. The secretary was requested
by the board to ask General Manager
Vining of the Market-street Railway Com-
Eany to hasten his reply to the letter sent
im on March 17 relating to the matter of
streetcar transfers.
The following were elected to member
ship in the association:

DR. HALLOCK WILL STAY
The Late Pastor of the Tacoma
Congregational Church to
Remain Here.
Failing Health Made It Necessary to
Seek a Milder Climate At
Mi-Is Summary.
The Rev. Dr. Leavitt H. Hallock, late
pastor of the First Congregational Church
of Tacomaâ the congregation formerly
presided over by the Rev. Dr. Charles O.
Brown of this Cityâ is now in San Fran
cisco.
Dr. Hallock came here for his health,
which had failed sadly in the northern
climate. He will lecture at Mills Seminary
for some time, and expects to permanently
locate in or near San Francisco. Dr. Hal
lock, in truth, is willingâ even waiting â
to receive a call here. He is a forcible and
eloquent expounder of the Christian re
ligion according to the Congregational
dogma, and is one of the best known and
best liked preachers of that denomination
on the coast.
The resignation of the pastor from his
late charge in Tacoma and the manner of
its regretful acceptance by the congrega
tion are perhaps best told in the minutes
of the eccleciastical council called to con
sider the matter. The minutes read as
follows:
Pursuant to letters missive an ecclesi
; astical council assembled in the lecture
j room of the First Congregational Cnurch
| of Tacoma at 3 o'clock p. m. April 7, 1896,
I on request of the said church and pastor,
, to review their proceedings and advise as
j to the dissolution of the present pastorate.
The council was constituted as follows:
j Tacomaâ East Church, Rev.'A. J. Smith,
j Brother A. D. Cole delegate; Lake Park
i Rev. W. H. Atkinson; Royâ Rev. Herbert
I Gregory; Stellacoomâ Rev. W. F. Rose,
| Brother N. Doening; McMillinâ Rev. O.
; L. Fowler, Brother J. E. Young; Seattle
: Plymouth, Rev. W. H. G. Temple, O. A.
Waterhouse; Seattleâ Taylor, Rev. G. H.
i Lee, Brother F. L. Cook; SeattleâEdge
â¢ water. Rev. J. T. Nichols; Snohomishâ
I Rev. W. C. Merritt; also Rev. A. P. Pow
j eison. .;--::yy( r\-;'.
Organization was effected by the choice
or the Rev. W. C. Merritt moderator and
Rev. J. T. Nichols scribe. Prayer.. was
offered by Rev. W. H. G. Temple.
The re-ignation of the pastor and the
action of the church accepting the same
were presented by the clerk of the church.
Dr. Hallock made statements amplify
! ing the reasons for his action; and re
j marks were made by members of the
j church appreciative of the work of the
pastor, and expressing the grief of the
i church in acceding to his request. Coun
cil voted to be by itself.
After due consideration of all the facts
j placed before the council, the roll being
! tailed, it was voted unanimously that the
; council concur in the action of the church
and pastor, and the following resolutions
were unanimously adopted, viz:
Resolved, That the council is led to this ac
tion only in recognition of manifest Providen
tial indications that Dr. Hallock's health de
mands a change of climate for its perfect
restoration, and for his permanent efficiency in
the gospel ministry.
Resolved, That we" hereby recognize, with'ex
! ceptional pleasure, the fellowship and co-op
eration of our brother, Rev. L. 11. Hallock,
j during his more than three years' residence
j among us iv the pastorate of the First Church
i of Tacoma.
VNe also express our unqualified esteem and
affection for him, and commend him to the
sympathy and love of any people of God among
whom his lot may in the future be cast, as a
brother eloquent in word, earnest and pure in
life and diligent in the Master's business.
We further gratefully recall the larger and
broader work of . his ministry and services
throughout our entire State, and gladh recog
nize that his generous sympathy arid wise
counsel have been freely bestowed upon all
objects, ecclesiastical, educational or social,
that have sought his assistance.
It is quite likely that Dr. Hallock will
not remain long in waiting for a call. He
will probably, be heard in one or more of
the Oakland churches within the next few
weeks, and after that his location will,
it is thought, follow speedily. ;y
THE SAN CISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 17, 1896.
IS LIKE A NEW CHURCH.
Olivet Presbyterian Building
Will Be Remodeled in the
Near Future.
THE MONEY ALREADY RAISED.
The Potrero Church Which Has Quite
Outgrown Its Accommo- ,
dations.
' _____
The building, of Olivet Presbyterian
Church is to be enlarged to nearly double
DR. M ATHENA'S CHURCH AS IT WILL APPEAR FROM TENNESSEE STREET.
its present size. The roof will also be
raised and made to run parallel instead of
perpendicular to the frontage, and' the
church will be painted, garnished and
decorated; in fact, to all intents it will be
a new building.
The great need for a new "building has
been to accommodate tbe children of the
Olivet Sunday-school. The church is situ
ated on Tennessee street, between Napa
and Sierra. It is a growing neighborhood.
The school has increased so that it is now
impossible to accommodate the many
children that gather there on Sundays.
Every available inch of space is used;
there is a class behind the pulpit, one be
side the stove, one in the choir seats and
one in every other spot where a class can
possibly be crowded in, but the church
seats 175 and tuere are sometimes 200
present in the school.
Under such circumstances it has been
found impossible to separate the classes,
so, as the school is still growing, the
pastor, Rev. E. G. Mathena, D. D., and
the trustees decided to build. They did
not wish to incur any indebtedness, how
ever, so means were taken to raise money
before having plans drawn up. Dr.
Mathena has a faithful band of Sabbath
school workers who were enthusiastic over
the prospect new quarters, and through
the efforts of the Ladies' Mite Society, the
Y. P. S. C. E., the Helping Hand and Dr.
Mathena himself they, have now $1400 in
hand, which will go along way toward de
fraying the expenses of the proposed
changes. yKyr r.-Cy
The plans accepted call for an addition
of 18 feet to the frontage, so that the
church will, when completed, occupy a
frontage of 60 feet. The addition in the
rear will consist of two large classrooms,
which can be thrown Into one by removing
the folding doors. These rooms will oc
cupy a little more than the amount of
space which the church at present occu
pies. There will be no difficulty about
space, as the church owns the adjoining
lot fronting on the street, as well as the
lot in the rear, which is 153 feet by 57 feet.
The classrooms will be in the rear, and
the addition at the north side, fronting
the street, will not be thrown into the
church proper, but will be used as a
library. Access to the classrooms will be
obtained through this library, and also
from the church.
The plans have been accepted, and work
will be begun on the new building almost
immediately. It is expected that within
four months Olivet Presbyterian Church
will have accommodations for 400 Sunday
school pupils. The building when com
pleted will be plain but comfortable, and
the additions will be in accordance with
the general plan of the church.
HIS SKULL FRACTURED.
Isaac Lipsic Knocked Down by a Turk-

FISH FOR CLEAR LAKE.
A Fine Assortment Has Just Arrived
â¢From San Diego County. ;y 'â :'
Deputy Fish Commissioners Wilson and
Cross arrived yesterday with a large con
signment of live fish which will be liber
ated in Clear Lake, Lake County, to-day
or to-morrow. These fish were caotured
in Lake Cuyamaca, sixty miles from San
Diego, and are in first-class condition.
The shipment consists of big mouth bass,
yellow perch, banded pickerel and the
green sunfish all fine game and food fish.
i -V are all proline breeders, particu
larly the bass, which, different from many
Other species, keeps guard over the spawn.
.No other fish can approach the "nest"
without having a fight on its hands with
the gamy bass. After the young have
hatched the old ones herd them off to the
warm shallow waters and to the good
feeding grounds until they are able to
care for themselves.
The other fish mentioned are also pro
lific, and it is hoped that in a short time
they will destroy all of the fish at present
in Clear Lake. This lake derived its name
from the clearness of its waters, but years
ago a lot of carp and catfish were intro
duced. Since then the waters would be
more properly called rnuddv lake. These
piscatorial hogs have multiplied remark
ably, and many have attained a very large
growth. They are now so numerous that
the lake is often more like a big mud pool
because of these fish keeping the sediment
on the bottom in constant commotion.
The bass and other fish imported from the
south will gradually destroy the carp and
catfish by devouring the "latter's spawn. I
The people of Lake County will welcome ;
the new arrivals and give them every pro
tection until their numbers will warrant
fishing for sport and food.
HENDY LITIGATION.
One of the Legatees Is Not Satisfied
With the Present Management
of the Kstnte.
The litigation in the Hendy estate has
received another impetus by a petition
filed by Mrs. Josephine Green, which asks
for the revocation of the letters testament
ary issued to Samuel J. Hendy.
In her petition Mrs. Green says that the
original contest was dismissed under an
agreement, by the terms of which she was
to receive $20,000 from Mrs. Mary Mc-
Gum's share of the estate should the share
prove to be of the value of $155,000 or
more, or she was to get three-twentieths if
less.
She charges that the estate has been
grossly mismanaged by the executors and
that they have set aside for their own use
large sums which should have been al
lowed to remain in the estate. Samuel
Hendy is charged with having Increased
bis salary as president of the machine
works from $200 to $500, and John H.
Hendy has increased his salary from $65 to
$300 a month. In conclusion she asks that
she be appointed an administratrix of the
estate and that the present administrator
be compelled to make an accounting. The
estate is appraised at $452,046 16. - -- r

WARDEN HALE'S RECORD.
Expenses at San Quentin Under
His Management Greatly
Reduced.
THE JUTE MILL DEPARTMENT.
Prison Directors Authorize Many
Changes Which Premise Go:d
Resu ts.
During the past few months Warden
Hale of San Quentin has been subjected
to not a little unfavorable criticism. This
was not of a particularly personal charac
ter, but directed rather toward the finan
cial management of the institution over
which he presides.
Of course a large portion of the censure
has come from the Warden's political ene
mies who sought to feather their own
nests by tearing to pieces that in which
Mr. Hale is so comfortably situated. The
income, or rather the lack of it, from the
jute mills has been the chief weapon used
by those who would like to see the Warden
following some other occupation.
Yesterday Edgar J. de Pue, a member of
the Board of Prison Directors for the last
nine years, threw considerable light on the
management of San Quentin and inci
dentally gave what appears to be excellent
i reasons for the jutemills having become
| during the past two or three years more of
j a burden than a profit.
I "W. E. Hale was elected Warden in
j 1891, ' i said Mr. DePue, by way of introduc
tion. "The appropriation for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1891, was $165,000, but
I the actual cost of maintaining the prison
I was far in excess of thisâ s23B,996 21. The
j cost per capita was within a fraction of 50
j cents. Since the fiscal year ending June
30, 1892, Warden Hale has gradually re
duced the expenses of the prison, and in
spite of the financial depression has suc
ceeded in operating the jute department
at a profit, except in 1893. The appended
table shows the financial record of the in
stitution since June 30, 1889:

| "it will be observed that Mr. Hale has
had to combat decreasing appropriations
and at tne same time take care ofthe jute
department during a long season of finan
cial depression. On March 16, 1889 the
Legislature amended the act passed in 1885
establishing a permanent fund for the pur
chase of jute to be manufactured at San
Quentin. The act now reads:
The people of the State of California repre
toltows- nate aDd Assembly do enact as
Section 1 The 'sum. of $100,000 is hereby
appropriated out of any money in the State
treasury not otherwise appropriated, to pro
vide and maintain a permanent revolv
ing. fund for the purchase of jute for
the State prisons. All moneys taken there
from to he used exclusively in payment
for jute to be used in manufacturing in said
State prisons, and as much of the money re
ceived from the sale of any goods manufac
tured from said jute shall be returned to the
said revolving fund, so that the fund shall con
tain $100,000 before any of the proceeds from
the sale of said manufactured Roods are used
for any other purpose than the purchase of
jute.- i
Sec. 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
''This revolving fund has never been al
lowed to fall below the $100,000 mark. The
stock of raw jute and the manufactured
article now on hand is valued at $214,000;
so it will be seen that this particular de
partment of the State prison is in excel
lent condition so far as resources go. Some
comment has been indulged in, because no
sales were made in 1895. This is of easy
explanation â the north winds came and
practically ruined the crops.
"Thousands of sacks were imported and
the brokers were ordered to sell them at
â  any price. Every time the jutemills at
Saa Quentin made a. price the brokers
would go under them. The law is respon
; sible in a measure for this, because it al
' lows Warden Hale to sell only to farmers.
' When money is scarce the farmer finds
: himself compelled to buy from merchants
i supplying him with other necessaries dur
. ing the year. -
"The law further stipulates that not
j more than 5000 bags shall be sold to any
! one man unless the Prison Directors unan
'â  imously agree otherwise. In view of the
I enormous stock on hand, due to last year's
j failure, the directors have wisely allowed
i the Warden to sell an unlimited number
Ito one purchaser. With this ruling aud
I the improved financial condition it is
I more than probable that the jutemills at
; San Quentin will turn into tne prison a
j handsome profit at the end of the year.
| Warden Hale is delighted over the pros
; pects. Incidentally it may be remarked
that the quality of the sacks manufactured
at San Quentin is vastly superior to the
imported article. I may say, without fear
of successful contradiction, that the farm
ers prefer them to the Calcutta bags.
"Mr. Hale has now been five years War
den of San Quentin, and during that time
not one prisoner has escaped. This is a
remarkable record compared with the
records of those who preceded him. It
proves nothing, however, except that if
the Warden is careful in one department
it is reasonably safe to assume that he does
not neglect the other interests entrusted
to him."
TOD SLOAN LOST THE DOG
Judge Low Decides That the
Jockey Was Not Its Right
ful Owner.
Snow Flake, a Well-Trained While
English Setter, Makes Its Ap
pearance in Court.
Snow Flake, a finely trained white Eng
lish setter, was the principal attraction in
Judge Low's court yesterday morning,
and four eminent attorneys poured forth
their eloquence to convince the Judge as
to who was its rightful owner.
Tod Sloan, the well-known jockey, who
had possession of Snow Flake, was repre
sented by Colonel Kowaisky and Justice
of the Peace Carroll, and Charles S. King,
an employe of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, who claimed to be the rightful
owner of the dog, was represented by At
torneys Treadwell and Eddie Sweeney-
King testified that Snow Flake was pre
sented to him by a friend in Reno, Nev.
Last May he was walking along Taylor
street with tho dog when it mysteriously
disappeared, and it was not till about two
weeks ago that he learned it was in the
possession of Jockey Sloan.
Colonel Kowaisky said that Sloan had
purchased the dog for $100 from Frank L.
Stocking, and had paid $40 on account.
The dog had been following Sloan for
months through the City, and at the vari
ous racetracks', and it was strange that it
was not till this late day that Sloan's right
to ownership was disputed. He contended
that Sloan had a rightful claim to the dog,
and was backed up by Justice Carroll.
King explained that being a railroad
man he was seldom on the streets of the
City and had Pot the time or opportunity
to go to the racetracks.
red Perry testified that the dog last
May followed him on Taylor street. He
sold the dog to Stocking, now under arrest
for going on a "straw" bond, and Stock
ing sold it to Sloan.
Judge Low decided that King had
proved ownership of the dog and ordered
it into his custody. Colonel Kowaisky
wanted the dog kept in the custody of the
court until he obtained a writ of replevin,
but the Judge told him he had no desire
to become a pound keeper.
When Kins got outside of the court
room with Snow Flake Kowaisky ordered
him to give up the dog until he obtained
the writ of replevin, but the latter walked
away with his prize without further inter
ference.
PAID THE MONEY.
Buyers of the San Francisco and San
Mateo Hull Have Put Up.
All but $390 of the $300,000 which pur
chased the San Francisco and San Mateo
Electric. Railway last Saturday was put

Seawell's clerk, yesterday. The $390 rep
resents the receiver's commission on the
sale. 'J: "â >â 'â 
Over $600 of the amount was in coin and
the remainder was in certified checks. The
precious bundle was immediately taken
down to the County Clerk's office and
locked up.
This money will remain subject to the
order of court until the preferred claims
against the road have been settled. The
remainder will then be turned over to the
stockholders. The following claims were
filed yesterday at the time the money was
turne*d over: C. J. Holt, $16,230 81; Cali

"I don't like the people who make

Holbrook.
"I don't like a society that goes outside
its province and interferes with other peo
ple's business, and I don't liKe a man who

retorted John P. Dalton.
"You mean that I have spite against
you?"
"You have."
"I haven't."
"I think you have."
The dialogue ended in an exchange of
angry glances that threatened devastation
to any intermediary body.
This was the aftermath of the meeting
of directors of the Society for the Preven

headquarters of the society in the Donohoe
building yesterday.
Dalton had the last word of the colloquy.
He struck a match on the mantel of the
secretary's room, looked at that official In
a quizzical way and said :.
"I am satisfied. The society has sus

excited. Good-by." He set his hat a little
on one side and walked airily away, ac
companied by Donovan, his friend and for
the nonce legal adviser.
The society had a lively meeting. Closed
doors did not prevent the issuance of
sounds of verbal combat. But it soon be
came evident that the majority of the
directors did not support the secretary in
his stand against opening a coursing park
in this county.
Colonel Jackson opened the discussion
by a motion that the new coursing park at
Ingleside be not interfered with unless
acts of cruelty should be perpetrated
therein. The vote was a tie and declared

DIED FROM EXPOSURE.
The Body of Mrs. Theresa Helms
Found in a Vacant
Lot.
Her Aged Husband Went to the Alms
house While She Wandered About
the Streets Alone.
The body of Theresa Helms, aged 60
years, was found in a vacant lot on Steuart
street, between Mission and Howard, at
6:30 o'clock a. m. yesterday. She died
from want and exposure, though an au
topsy by Dr. Barrett at the Morgue showed
that the deceased had been afflicted with
heart disease. .;.'
Mrs. Helms was the wife of an old-time
violinist, now an inmate of the Alms
house. The old couple lived until recently
in a lodging-house at the corner of Wash
ington and Drumm streets. They were
unable to pay for their lodgings and were
forced out into the world. Helms decided
to go to the Almshouse, but his wife re
fused to accompany him. He gave her the
little money he possessed and they parted.
This was the last Helms saw of his wife
until he found her dead body at the
Morgue yesterday.
The couple married sixteen years ago in
South America, the deceased being Helms'
second wife. Helms says he was at one
time a land-owner at Santa Fe, but lost his
property before coming to San Francisco.
Helms says will not return to the
hospital, but will try to make a living by
playing his violin.FREE MARKET ON
THE WATER FRONT
The State Fruit-Growers
Discuss the Proposi
tion.
UNANIMOUSLY FAVORED
Necessary Steps Will Immedi
ately Be Taken for Estab
lishment.
TO CONCENTRATE THE TRADE.
Will Make a United Effort to Protect
the Producers of Perishable
Products.
At the convention of the State fruit
growers in the Chamber of Commerce yes
terday the proposition of establishing a
public wholesale market on the water
front for perishable products was clearly
set forth with all the contingent advan
tagas to the consumer and the producer.
The first question to be decided by the
convention was whether such a market
was desirable, and if so, then what steps
were necessary for its establishment.
Colonel Mark L. McDonald called the
convention to order, and B. M. Lelong was
chosen secretary. Subsequently, upon the
report of a committee on permanent or
ganization, they were made permanent
officers of the convention, with Robert
Howe as vice-president, y' â¢ .*
On suggestion of E. F. Adams, the n ames
of those present and whom they repre
sented was obtained, as follows:
Colonel Mark L. McDonald, Sonoma
County Horticultural Society; "William
L. Overhiser, Stockton Grange; Thomas
Jacobs. Visalia, TulareJGrange; C. F. Mont
gomery and J. A. Filcher, State Board of
Trade; E. F. Adams, Wrights, Highland
Grange, 80 growers; W. W. Chapman,
Pomona Grange, Sonoma County, repre
senting four subordinate granges; Robert
Howe and Mr. Merritt, Sonoma County
Horticultural Society; B. W. Rowley. H.
T. Hatch and H. P/Stubbs, State Horti
cultural Society; F. M. Righter, Califor
nia Dried Fruit Agency, representing at
least a thousand growers; S. I*. Saunders,
San Jose; W. W. Gladden, Healdsburg; B.
F.Walton, Sutter County; G. N. Sand
born, Sebastopol; E. T. Hunting, San
Jose; H. Bowman, Suisun, and many
others. President McDonald formally
opened the meeting. Said he:
The question of the establishment of a pub
lic wholesale market for perishable products
in San Francisco has been considered for some
time by different organizations. Numerous
r petitions and resolutions favoring its estab
i>hr_ent have been presented to the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners, asking for
the setting aside of partof the water front for
the establishment of this proposed market,
where any producer may sell or have sold his
products by any agent of his choice. The
Harbor Commission has signified its willing
ness to assign the necessary space and to co
operate in all way-; possible; but requires that
the producers, through an organization of
their own, shall have the direct detailed man
agement of the market, subiect of course to
such regulations as the commission may ap
prove.
In accordance with various requests made of
the State Board of Horticulture, this conven
tion was called to consider this subject and
determine if such a market as is proposed is
advisable, and if so decided to take the neces
sary steps for its establishment and such
other action as the convention may deem wise.
It is earnestly hoped that this convention will
act harmoniously and put this market project
into definite form. The space will be provided
free of rent, and if the convention can effect a
practicable plan of administration the market
will be. established and in a short time begin
to handle this year's fruit output. The matter
is wholly in the bands of the growers.
A committee of three on permanent
organization was appointed, consisting of
W. W. Chapman, William L. Overhiser
and S. B. Saunders.
E. F. Adams read a paper prepared
after a careful study of the subject for the
enlightenment of the convention. He
said in substance as follows:
The proposed market is now generally under
stood to be a wholesale market where produce
will be sold in unbroken original packages
from first hands.
The proposals do not deal with methods of
pale in- the least. They do propose as au
'essential element that the records of sale
(hall be open to the officers of the market and
to all others interested, so that any producer
desiring at any time to check his returns by
Â»ther information will merely have to address
the superintendent of the market, giving date
of shipment and name cf merchant and re
ceive by return mail name of purchaser and
price. This we do want, and no honest com
mission merchant will object to it, but on the
contrary will welcome it.
Another very common error I will allude to.
There is great concern on the part of many
that such a market as is proposed will not De
"supported" by growers. Now those who are
proposing this market do not in the least rely
on such voluntary support oil the part of
growers, as is Implied in the idea of special
consignments to such a market, in the absence
of which the product will go elsewhere. No
Buch market would be worth establishing. The
market we propose requires no promi
ses or pledges from anybody. To the
market which we propose all perishable
products will be delivered in due course of
business by the transportation corn^>anies and
will ah be alike taxed for whatever expense
may attend it.
There are two taxes which the trade now
pays which, if we can remove ln favor of the
new market, in my Judgment, will hold the
trade. The first is that of rent. The State of
fers space rent free and no commission man
paying rent can long compete with those pay
ing no rent.
The establishment of a rent-free market will
therefore certainly compel the commission
men to do business there. If all do not accede
at tir>t they will soon be compelled to do so or
'to .go out of the commission busi
ness. As we are situated, the grocers'
and other wagons can as easily go to
the water front for their produce as to stop at
Front street. Indeed they will much prefer to
do so, as they will there see what is in the mar
ket massed in the smallest possible space and
can do their business easier and quicker than
by wandering along blocked streets.
The proposal before the commission con
templates that the proposed market shall be a
common terminal for perishable products for
all transportation companies, where all such
products shall be delivered in due course of
business and without drayage charge.
In my judgment it is better toadhere strictly
to the original idea of a free marketâ that is,
a market- whose running expenses are paid
directly by the growers themselves, used for
their own benefit and controlled in the public
interest. The support of the market by tolls
has the additional advantage that all funds
would pass through the public treasury.
We would in most respects prefer that the
whole management of tne market shodld be
a strictly public function to be wholly dis
charged by the sworn officers of the State with
out Interference from any one.
It is obvious by this time that this conven
tion cannot establish the free market. We can
soy whether or not we favor it, and, if we
favor it, we can take such steps as in the wis
dom of the convention shall "seem likely to
promote it, and the Harbor Commission can
allot the spare. But the crucial point will
arise with the transportation companies. If
they will deliver, free of drayage, the perish
able products at the common terminal we can
have the market. If they will not, Ido not see
how we can.
In conclusion I have simply to say that we
all know how we regard the San Francisco
produce market. Speaking for the small
growers, who constitute the majority, we know
that there is hardly one of us who will ship a
pound of fruit here which we can dispose of
elsewhere. It is the dumping-gronnd tor our
refuse. This is not as it should be. The San
Francisco market is by far the largest market
in the world for .the perishable products of
California. . It is", our home market. .This
movement is an honest efiort to make it our
most profitable market, and our favorite mar
ket, and I trust this convention will rise to
the occasion and complete our work.
At the conclusion of his address Mr.
Adams submitted the following resolutions
for adoption by the convention :
Resolved, By tnis convention of fruit-growers
and others accustomed to ship perishable pro
ducts to the San Francisco market, that we
favor the concentration of the trade from first
hands in perishable products coming to San
Francisco at some suitable place upon the
water front in a free market under the juris
diction of the Harbor Commission, and that in
our judgment the following features are essen
tial to the success of said market:
Firstâ lt must be the usual and ordinary ter
minus for perishable products of all trans
portation companies, at which all such prod
ucts will be, delivered, unless otherwise ordered
by the shipper. y -y- â "->
Secondâ The sale must De conducted under
such regulations as- shall insure to all shippers
the opportunity to know, without expense to
themselves, whenever they may so desire,
the particulars of the disposal of their
products. - y y-.
Thirdâ To accomplish this purpose there
must be a competent inspection under the con
trol either of the Harbor Commission or of a
State organization of producers.
Fourthâ must be the authority to levy
upon all produce delivered to the market
whatever additional tolls to those now paid
which may be required to defray the expense
of proper supervision.
The chair appointed a committee on
resolutions consisting of P. M. Righter, J.
A. Filcher and B: F. Walton. This com
mittee took the resolutions to act upon
during the noon recess.
On the resumption of affairs at the
afternoon session Vice-President Robert
Howe officiated as chairman in the ab
sence of Colonel McDonald.
Chairman Righter of the committee on
resolutions stated that the committee
thoroughly indorsed the resolutions of
Mr. Adams and recommended them for
the adoption of the convention.
In addition to these Mr. Filcher sub
mitted the following resolutions outlining
the course to be pursued in the practical
establishment of the market:
Whereas, The California Fruit Exchange,
having been recognized by special and regular
annual convention of fruit-growers at the au
thorized representation of the fruit-growers of
California for all purposes connected
with the marketing of fruits, and whereas.
PROFESSOR TODD, ONE OF THE SCIENTISTS BOUND . FOR JAPAN.
the said exchange is, in our judgment,
the proper body to inaugurate and con
duct the proposed free market, therefore be it
Resolved, That the California Fruit Exchange
be and it is hereby requested and authorized to
Immediately take up the subject of the inaugu
ration of a free market for perishable products
and complete all necessary arrangements for
its estÂ© blfshment and conduct on the lines in
dicated by this convention.
Resolved, That a committee of five be elected
by this convention to confer with the directors
of the California Fruit Exchange for the pur
pose of securing representation on their board
of producers of perishable products other than
fruit, and recommend suitable persons for
those positions.
The entire set of resolutions were adopted
by a unanimous standing vote, and the
following were elected on the committee
of five: Wjlliam L. Overhiser, Stockton;
Senator William Johnston, Richmond,
Sacramento County ;â¢ J. A. Filcher, Placer

. During the election of this committee
Commission Merchant George Allison
was nominated, but positively declined to

reasons that the commission men, should
they find something objectionable in the
present proposition, would rather do their
fighting in whole than in part.
It was directed that this committee
should meet Monday, the 27th inst., the
directors of the State Board of Horticulture

YOUNG JAMES PAYS EXPENSES.
Professor Todd on His Fourth Expe
dition Has Planned to Defy
the Clouds.
When the moon in its orbit comes ex
actly between the earth and the sun, as it
does at long and irregular intervals, there
is on the earth a dense shadow in which,
when the eclipse is complete, no part of
the sun's glaring disk is visiDle, but the
great fiery radial streamers of luminous
vapors shooting out thousands and thou
sands of miles from the surface of the sun
are then and then only seen plainly, fring
ing the big black circle and forming a
marvelous and resplendent wheel of fire
against a background of infinity. \
It is in order that he may witness and
study this phenomenon that the as
tronomer calculates far in advance just
where, when sun, moon and earth are to
come in line again, the shadow will strike
the earth.
All the expenses of the undertaking
are to be borne by a wealthy and in
tensely loyal young graduate of Am
herst College, Arthur Curtiss James of
New York. He, accompanied by his pret-
] ty young wife, will captain his own private
I yacht Coronet that is to carry the party to
i Japan. She'is the largest sailing yacht of
I the New York Yacht Club fleet, and is
j now being refitted in this port after hav
i ing recently completed a speedy trip round
the Horn in coming out here.
The complete party that arrived here
yesterday, aside from a crew of fifteen
that will navigate the Coronet, consists of
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur C. James of New
York; Professor and Mrs, David P. Todd
of Amherst College; John Pemberton,
chief engineer of the United States navy,
j William P. Gerrish, a young man from
the Howard University observatory, who
I will act as photographer, Arthur W.
j Francis, E. A. Thompson and Dr. Vander
! poel Adrian. !
Professor Todd, when seen in his apart
! ments at the Palace, remarked that us
j head of this scientific expedition he sup
! posed he was public property, as far as the
j furnishing of information was concerned.
I have had four astronomical expeditions al
; together. The first was in 1878, when I was
sent to Dallas, Tex., in charge of a Govern
i ment expedition to observe the total eclipse of
j July 29 of that year. The sky was clear and
the results successful, although negative, for
j we were in search of inter-Mercurian planets
j and found none. Two astronomers, one in
| Colorado and one in Wyoming, during the same
eclipse thought they saw the supposed planet
Vulcan, but their assertions were not recog
nized. : ; ;"y ;.'">
My second expedition was when I came out
here in 1882 upon the invitation of Richard
P. Floyd, then president of the Lick board of
trustees, to superintend on Mount Hamilton
the observation of the transit of Venus. That
was my most successful expedition.
. It was a perfect day, not a cloud in sight
from the mountain. We took about 100 pho
tographs of the transit of Venus, and they are
pretty generally known now as the best photo
graphs of the transit of Venus ever taken. I
can say that, because I was not the photogra
pher; they were taken by an old man 1 brought
from Amherst. The finest negative of the lot
was from a plate made by Flagler of this City,
and as no other transit of Venus will occur un
til June. 2004, he is likely to hold the record
with that plate.
Then my third one was to Japan in 1887 to
observe the total eclipse of the sun on August
19. That was under the auspices of toe Na
tional Academy of Sciences at Washington.
And the fourth one was also a Government
expedition, under the auspices of the United
States Naval . Department. Secretary Trace v
ordered the transportation of the expedition
in the United States steamship Pensacola. The
station selected was Angola, a* Portuguese
colony on the west coast of Africa.
These two expeditions were about equally
unsuccessful on account of the Interference of
local clouds at the critical moment.
The party will stop at Honolulu for a
week on the way to Japan, the intention
being, elements permitting, to arrive at
Yezo fully three weeks before the day of
the eclipse, in order to put up all "the
apparatus and give it repeated tests.
An Evening With Tennyson.
> A well attended reception and entertain
ment was given at Golden Gate Hall last even
ing by Golden Gate Commandery No. 1, 0. E.
S. There were Instrumental and vocal solos
music by a quintet under the direction of
Professor Adeistein and several excellently de
livered recitations. The feature of the even
ing was a living pictorial representation of
Tennyson's "A Dream of Fair Women." The
characters represented were Helen of Troy
Iphlgenia.Cleopatra, Jephtha's daughter, Rosa-'
mond, Eleanor and Joan of Arc. The partici
pants in the latter were the Misses Johnson
Stephenson. Hobe, Willats, Murphy, Heuer
and Bradley.
Swallowed Morphine.
. William Gounly, a laboring man living at
1326 Pacific street, swallowed a dose of mor
phine last evening. He was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital in a dying condition. He
told Policeman Edwards, who accompanied
him to the hospital, that he was despondent
and wanted to die.^^gs^^C^g^ - fV

WILL BE ARGUED TO-DAY
The Evidence in the Martin
â¢ Case Is Now All
In.
LAWYERS ON THEIR METTLE.
That Affidavit That Is on the Way
Will Arrive Too
Late.
Very little new evidence found its way
into the record of the Martin case yester
day, but so stubbornly did the counsel on
both sides contest each point of it that it
was not until near the hour of adjourn
ment that they both admitted they were
through.
Then the question arose bb to the argument
and it was decidedâ the court and jury
agreeing that it should take place this
morning. There will probably be but two
speeches, Mr. Delmas waiving his right to
open and General Barnes going to the
jury first.
The brakeman on the train at Towles at
the time Martin was ejected was the first
witness called yesterday. He testified that
he took no part in the affair except to
bring Martin's baggage out of the, car and
set it in the station.' This finished the de
fense proper, except for the right claimed
to introduce the copy of the affidavit al
leged to have been made by the plaintiff
in a one-time real estate transaction in
which, it is alleged, he swears he never
was married. General Barnes said the
affidavit would arrive this evening.
Delmas met this by simply saying, l, We
decline to proceed with our rebuttal till the
defense closes its case."
"It was tacitly agreed yesterday," said
Barnes, "that this document would be ad
mitted when it arrived. This document is
designed to contradict the direct state
ment of the plaintiff.
"Yesterday, when we undertook to prove
the existence of this affidavit by a witness,
the counsel on the other side made the
statement that one or the other, his
own , client or this young man Hath
away, who is, in a measure, under my pro
tection, must be committing perjury, and
that whichever it is shown to be will be
prosecuted. Now Ido not propose to sub
ject a young man 20 years of age, and who
is 1600 miles from his home, to the chances
of being harassed in that way. I wish to in
troduce the document itself, if it exists. I
have a telegram saying it has been sent
and will arrive this evening." y Vy
"If your Honor please," said Delmas,
"we have no evidence that there is such a
document as is spoken of. We are willing
to accent this evidence on the subject and
of the contents. The counsel on the other
side was, yesterday, very willing and ready
to offer the evidence when we saw : fit to
challenge it. Now we are willing to admit
it and allow the defense to close. .
"Have you the witness here?" asked the
court of Barnes.
"Oh, yes; he is in court."
"Then why not put him on the stand
and dispose of tnis matter?"
"For the reason that I have stated I do
not care to pit ; the memory of this young
man against a written document, however
certain he may be of his memory, in view
of what has been stated." y.
So : the matter stopped thereâ neither
document nor evidence touching it
went in. â ..â -.
i.p There was another long struggle over the
attempt of General Barnes to get in the
conversation between the Sioux City de
tective, Morrison, and the representative
of Pifiker tons when the latter Visited that
place. Delmas had Morrison tell what he
understood the object of the Pinkerton
man's visit. to Sioux City was and General
Barnes, when it came to his turn, claimed
the right under this Question to demand
all of the conversation that took place at
the time.
The court agreed that he had the right.
"Your quarrel is with the law," said Judge
Daingerfield.
"On, no," said Delmas, "the law is wise
enough." â ~?
In the subsequent argument Barnes re
ferred to Delmas i as having been "sup
pressed" by the court, which called out one
of Delmas' icy discourses on courtesy and
brought from Barnes a disclaimer that he
intended any discourtesy.
"I am not more sensitive than othersâ
in fact I am not sensitive at all," said Del
mas, "but the other, side is constantly
talking about courtesy and therefore
should be more choice in the selection of
its language.''
But Delmas had no idea of sitting
quietly under the ruling of the court and
allowing "all the slander and innuendo and
gossip," as he called it, that might have
passed between the two detectives in their
discussion of his client to be intro
duced into the case. With the first
question under the ruling he offered new
objections and moved that a certain ex
pression, which he claimed was not re
sponsive to his question, be stricken out.
This motion was allowed and with it the
row was closedâ the conversation was
barred.
By way of rebuttal Delmas put the
piaintiff Martin on the stand. Mar
tin swore that he had written his name at
request of the several conductors and others
in good faith and with no thought of prac
ticing deception; declared he had never
offered bis ticket for sale to the scalpers
although one of them, Englehardt, nad
made him an offer on it when he was in
the office asking about the departure of
trains; that he had been very roughly
handled when ejected from tbe train and
had been since under medical treatment
in Sioux City and Chicago.
A SAILOE'S WONDEEFQL EYES.
He Has No Difficulty lv Telling Time
by a Town Clock Two Miles Away.
John Bush, a sailor on the small coast
wise Bchooner Caroline, that all one week
lay near the Jersey shore south of Jersey
City, probably has the keenest sight of any
man in America.
He is a small spindle-legged man, very
dark skinned, and his eyes are the black
est of the black. His parents would not
likely recognize him by the name of
"John Bush," for that is a contraction of
"John the Bushman," as John is a native
born . Bushman. Twelve years ago he
shipped from Cape Town as a sailor on a
British merchantman and has since fol
lowed the sea.
While the little schooner lay off the Jer
sey shore, when John wanted to know the
time o' day he would glance at the tower
clock on the New York Produce Exchange
building, two miles away, and he had no
more trouble in telling the hour than did
the skeptical spectator beside him, who
tested John's accuracy by his own watch.
"That's easy lor a Bushman," said John.
"We haven't white men's eyes. We think
you people are blind if you want to see a
long way, but your eyes are good for what
is near. . My people can see far, far away,
because we .have to, and were born that
way for many years. ! We must see away
off or there would, be no Bushmen, for
there '''are. wild beasts in Africa, and our
people are not big or strong, and have not
had guns. They must know, danger in
time so as to get away. They watch and
watch for hundreds of years, and so their
eyes get to be very strong, and very good
for things far away. And then we i on't
use our eyes as much or spoil them by
reading and fine work as you do."â New

yesterday afternoon in Memorial Hall,
Odd Fellows' building, after completing
the business of the year in three days.
There were 180 representatives in attend
ance from the various parts of the District
of California, in which Nevada is included.
Yesterday morning the election of officers,
Miss Clara McDonald, Grand Treasurer.
which had occupied a large part of the
preceding day, was completed, and in the
afternoon the following were installed in
office forthe ensuing year:
Grand councilorâ M. Boehm of San Fran
cisco.
Grand assistant councilorâ H. Pratt of
Virginia City, Nev.
Grand vice-councilorâ E. R. Tiel of Sacra
mento.
Grand recorderâ S. C. Walllsof Ran Francisco.
Grand treasurerâ Miss Clara McDonald of

Francisco.
Grand wardenâ Lizzie Morse of Marysvilie.
Grand guardâ Mrs. M. A. Borland of Bodie.

Grand trusteeâ W. M. McFadden of Anaheim.
In addition to the election of the dis
trict officers seven supreme delegates were
chosen to attend the Supreme Council to
be held in 1897 in Louisville, Ky., where
i the 6800 members in the District of .Cali
fornia will be represented by the following:
H. W. Hutton^T. H. O'Brien and E. I.
Wolf, of San Francisco ; T. H. Selvage,
Eureka; H. B. M. Miller, , Golden Gate;
W. H. Savage, San Pedro, and A. B. San
born, Jackson, Cal.
Last night, as a final act before disband
ing preparatory to leaving to-day for their
i various homes, the delegates assembled in
I a body in the hall of Social Council No. 46,
| at 320 Post street, and witnessed the initi
ation of several candidates, the representa
tives' initiating team' having charge of the
ceremonies. There was a large attendance
of local members. -;- : -
No very important business came up be
fore the convention this year, and as a re
sult the session was two days shorter than
in 1894 and a day shorter than in 1895.
The most important legislation was tho
fixing of the annual per capita tax at $1.
The grand councilor was allowed a con
tingent fund of $1000, and the grand
recorder and the grand treasurer were
made members of the executive committee.
The record of the three days' secret de
liberations may be summarized thus :
Tuesdayâ Reading' of resolutions; reports of
committees; reports of officers; long discus
sion on the advisability of holding biennial in
stead of annual sessions, which was defeated;
amendments to by-laws; instructions to su
preme representatives.
Wednesdayâ Nomination and partial election
of delegates and officers, and at night a grand
social and ball in Native Sons of tbe Golden
West Hall, attended by 2000 persons.
Thursdayâ Completion of the election of offi
cers; explanation of the new law adopted at
the last session of the Supreme Council, with
regard to fraternal insurance; payment of mile
age and per diem rates to delegates; installa
tion of officers, and at night a model initiation
in Red Men's Hall. ;
Opinions of Great Generals on War.
Arbitration between nations signifies the
same thing as the existence of the ordinary
judicial courts. It means the substitution
of reason for force as a means of decision.
That its possibilities are great has already
been demonstrated; that they will grow
with the development of a disposition to
peace is unquestionable. An indication of
this tendency may be found in the abhor
rence of war by great commanders. The
sentiment of Wellington, "Nothing except
a battle lost can be half so melancholy as
a battle won," was expressed more bluntly
by General Sherman: "Do yon know what
war is? War is hell!" while General
Grant, speaking with direct pertinence to
tbe subject of arbitration, said: "Though
I have. been trained as a soldier and have
participated in many battles, there never
was a time when, in my opinion, some way
could not have been found of preventing
the drawing of the sword. I look forward
to an epoch when a court, recognized by
all nations, will settle international differ
ences, instead of keeping large standing ar
mies, as they do in Europe."â -The Cen

"Ought women to vote?
The spacious auditorium of the Young

thronged to the doors last night with
people anxious to hear the latest answer
to this much vexed question. Nor did the
fairer portion of humanity preponderate.

clear cut, classic features wreathed in sil
very locks arranged in the fashion of a
half century ago, and her spare, erect
figure clad in a plain but elegant costume
of black brocade. Mrs. Cooper, in black
nun's veiling, with a corsage bouquet of
tea roses, took a scat next her rabbinical
antagonist, and Mrs. Ada Van Pelt, Mme.
Louise Sorbier, Mrs. A. A. Sargent, and
other well-known lady suffragists occupied
chairs at either side of the stage.
"Why do I believe in woman suffrage
commenced Mrs. Cooper. "I answer that
woman has to obey the law, has to pay
taxes and is amenable to all the vicissi
tudes to which men are subject. Hence 1
believe woman should have a right to say
something as to the administration and
enactment of the laws. And, besides, it
seems more in accord with our grand
American ideal that all the rational beings
who have to submit to the authority of the
government should have some voice in
the government.
"We are told that women do not wish to
vote. So also were we told that the ne
groes did not wish to be freed. Yet when
they were liberated none of them elected
to remain in slavery. When they were
freed tney voted. Why should we con
sider the wife, the mother or the sister
less worthy to approach the polls than the.
. negro?
"I know that St. Paul the dear, stern
browed old bachelor â says that woman
should keep silent in church and in public
assemblies. But what would he think of
tie jewels and the graceful, elegant
clothes worn by the ladies of to-day?
The truth is that he wrote for the pagan
women of old, whose morals were at a low
ebb. Hence, the great apostle wished his
converts of the fairer sex to be distin
guished by their modesty in dress and de
meanor.
"Napoleon I once asked Mme. de Stael
why women persisted in meddling with
politics. 'Sire,' she answered, 'if you men
will persist in hanging us, we ought at
least to have the right to ask the reason
why.' Taxation without representation is
tyranny. Yet women are taxed in this
free country without anything in the
shape of representation.
"Does this seem right and just? To be
sure we are told that women are better
than men because they have been kept
from politics. Well, if this be true, then
why can we not disfranchise the men and
see whether that step will make them any
better than they are. yy.y
"As at present situated woman labors
under many unjust discriminations. Now,
if a mother dies, there is no confusion in the
family a new wife comes, new children
are born, and nothing is upset.,' But let
the father die, then the inheritance is
divided among widow and children, and
in many cases we find children complain
ing that they have to 'support their mother'
out of the property which she helped to
accumulate. Is this just?
"I am a convert , to the doctrine of
woman suffrage. Some years ago I even
wrote against it, but of late years I have
come to regard the matter trom a differ
ent standpoint. A day is coming when
those whom God hath joined shall not be
put asunder. Man and woman shall enjoy
an equal independence, bear an equal por
tion of life's burdens and recognize obli
gations which are reciprocal. The day is
coming, and we may live to see it." y *
A burst of applause greeted Mrs. Cooper
as she took her seat, a number of hand
some floral tributes being handed to her
over the footlights. y-i ,
Dr. Voorsanger in his reply said:
"We hear that women are equal to men.
There is very tittle to say in answer to this
since it is true. There are in fact too
many men who ought ' to be kept out of
politics and obliged "â â  to stay at home.
Who could look for a more disgusting
state of things than that which surrounds
the ballot-box at the present day? This
condition it is that keeps so many good
men opposed to women voting. The at
mosphere of,! ignorance and . corruption
which pervades the polls is unfit for a good
woman to breathe. J-> ->â -'.. |:~
"One thing I must, however, say: If
woman goes out into the devious ways of
government the' home becomes imperiled.
We know what took place in ancient Rome
when women, who should be mentioned
only in terms of pity, were at the bead of
politics and letters. A woman who be
comes ~ a wife and a mother gives to the
state a certain security that she will aid in
the formation of good and worthy citi
zens. The question of woman suffrage
would never have arisen had not men
forced woman to cry out for justice. The
ancient Jewish law gave to a woman hav
ing no male representative a civic equality
with men. But .this applied to single
women. The wife and mother and daugh
ter need not vote, since - they have hus
band, son, brother or father to'plcad their
cause, and represent, them at the polls.'
The unit in the sura of , the state is not
man or woman, but the family, of which
the husband and lather is the accredited
representative. ' â -
'â¢I believe the giving of the ballot to
woman in the present state of society
would be a menace to the home and a
calamity to the Nation. : Woman is man's
equal in birth and station; she is his
superior in virtue, but she cannot cope
with him in the arena of politics and
public life. Give me a century of women
free from paint, powder and false modesty
and then we will have a race which will
consist of units in a grander and nobler
civilization than earth has ever yet known.
These families, or units, will not quarrel
about ballot, but the family itself will
vote through one or other of its noble
heads, either the kingly man or the
queenly woman.
"I contend that the men alone should
vote, for the present. The nun, I say, and
not. the loafers, not the corrupt, degraded
beasts who walk on two feet. The true
men should vote, and if they alone wielded
the power of the ballot, women would need
it not."
Miss Anthony then .summed up the
merits of the two addresses: . :_ i
"Rabbi Voorsanger," she commenced,
"seems to think that the woman is to
grow up into an equality with man, though
she yet remains in bondage. It seems like
not allowing a boy to enter the water until
he has learned how to swim. How can the
boy learn to swim or the woman learn to
be man's equal until both are free to take
tbe necessary steps for the acquirement of
the knowledge which they seek.
"It is said that woman suffragists are
scolding viragos; but I nave known the
loveliest women to-be prominent in this
movement since its inception. Think of
Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Caay Stanton,
Lucy Stone and so many elegant, culti
vated and noble women who have graced
this grand concerted effort for woman's
emancipation. I could go over the rabbi's
objections, but it is hard to buffet against
the air."
"I am not sufficiently advanced yet to
contradict a lady," interposed the rabbi.
"Ah, how cruel!" rejoined Miss An
thony ; "that one expression contains in it
all the tyranny of past barbarous ages.
Men will not argue or dispute with a
woman because they consider her beneath
them in intellect. But the day is coming,
and not all the powers of evil can post
pone its dawning, when woman will force
the earth to recognize her as the equal,
socially, intellectually and politically, of
man. When that day. dawns the ballot
will come with it; and, women of Amer
ica, we bave not long to wait."
AN INDIFFERENT SERVICE
Potrero Heights People Angry
With the Sixteenth-Street
Line.
A Road That Has No Beginning and
No Endâ Transfers Not Given
by the Company.
The residents of Potrero Heights are in
dignant. They are angry. They talk of
mass-meetings, injunction proceedings and
other things not so miid. The object of
all these verbs is the abortive and almost
useless system of electric-cars that incon
venience the residents of that district
daily and hourly. This is the Sixteenth
street electric line extension.
This line has, or is supposed' to have, a
starting point on the bay, near Fillmore
street, thence to Church and Sixteenth
streets, and along the latter to Harrison.
Here the Southern . Pacific Railroad Com
pany's steam line puts a stop to the
trie-ear's continuation, because the road
bed of the steam line is several feet below
grade.
At this point the passenger bound east
or west must alight and cross the railroad
tracks on Harrison street at the risk of his
life. Should he get across, with whole
bones and if a car should happen to be
there he re-embarks ana continues his
journey. If there is no car in sightâ well
one can walk or one can wait. From here
the car runs to Bryant avenue, where it
stops short and a connection with another
car is made that continues on Sixteenth
street to Kansas. The track runs one
clock on Kansas street to Seventeenth,
and this thoroughfare is traveled for six
blocks to Connecticut, and along the latter
to Eighteenth street (formerly Solano),
and along this street to Kentucky street.
This is the route, but to travel over it on
one of the electric-cars as they are now
run will take over one hour, besides the
inconvenience of transferring at the points
mentioned and running the risks of being
ground to pieces at the crossing of Harri
son street. Â .
Persons living between Bryant avenue
and Kentucky street in order to reach
Third and Folsom streets have got to walk
either to Kentucky street or take the Six
teenth-streetcar going west and transfer
to Bryant and then make the best of the
rest of the way, as the company will not
give a transfer from the Solano-street line
to Kentucky going north, but only to
those going to South San Francisco. Again
at the junction of Sixteenth street and
Bryant avenue passengers, when trans
ferring, must wait for fifteen minutes, as
the Solano-street line runs at those inter
vals only. -;'-:i;y:.' -y
Libel Suit Decided.
United States District Judge Morrow yester
day handed down an opinion in the libel case
of the Earnmoor Steamship Company against
the New Zealand Insurance Company. The
opinion says: yy y
Libel in personam to recover pro rata of a gen

adjusters as general average disallowed by the
court. They were: (1) The allowances for dam
age to the wrecking outfit of Peter Wright <fc Sons
incurred in rendering assistance to the stranded
ship Earnmoor. (2) The allowance of profit paid
to the charter as a condition of relinquishing the
voyage. The remaining items were allowed and a

SPRING EXHIBIT OPENS
Many Good Pictures and a Few
That Are Bad and In
different.

ART INSTITUTE RECEPTION.
Open House at the Hopkins Mansion
to Members and Their
Friends.
The spring exhibition of paintings at the
Art Institute was inaugurated last night
by a reception to members and their
friends. ' The rooms were charmingly
decorated for the occasion with palms,
ferns and quantities of natural flowers.
There was a large attendance at the re
ception, so large, in fact, that at times it
was difficult to obtain a view of some of
the most interesting pictures, in conse
quence of the block in front of them.
During the course of the evening a musi-
cal programme was performed and re
freshments were served in the university
extension lecture hall. .â â f y"
The picture exhibit is interesting, al
though not very large. Some of the works

are exceedingly good. Many have been
painted by artists who have aimed at a
great deal and have only succeeded in
achieving mediocrity, while a few of the
works are noticeably bad.
The paintings that attracted most inter
est and comment, last nig were those
entered for the Phelan competition. The
offer of $1000 by Mr. Phelan for the best
picture illustrative of certain .important
events ;in , the history of California . evi
dently was little inducement to the artists
of the Golden State, as only four of them
responded with paintings. 'They are hung
in the conservatory and in the daytime
especially can be seen ito perfect advant
age. Three of tho artistsâ Mathews, Keith
and Pissis â selected ' the y subject. "The
Discovery of San Francisco Bay by Por
tola." On the. whole the ; three pictures
are disappointing. * In the first place they
are "studio" pictures; but this, of course,
can be overlooked, considering the fact
that the bad weather of the past winter
prevented outdoor study. Every one of
the three pictures has a great deal of merit
and the artists deserve credit ; for their
efforts, but each has also a number of
shortcomings. . y.
Pictures of this character .cannot be sim
ply considered as" "pictures." but each
almost mechanical detail must be weighed
to see how they conform to historical
facts. In this respect Matthews' -picture
comes nearest to the requirements. Every
detail has been . carefully studied, and no
doubt' it would impossible, to find an
error of ; fact lin the ' whole composition.
The landscape is decidedly California in
the fall of the year, although most people
would feel that the distant mountains ,
lacked some of the delicate autumn hazÂ«j
SO : characteristic of this region. Taken
altogether the picture is good in color, but
lacKs the feeling of excitement that would
surely.take possession of a crowd of people
coming sudd^Â»ly and unexpectedly upon j
such a grand sight as the bay of San Fran- I
cisco. Ihe; figures seem a 'little "posey." j
But there is no disputing the fact that the
picture depicts what it is intended to.
Mr. Keith's picture is certainly one of
his best efforts as a work of art. It is
full of an intense dramatic interest and
magnificent in color. - The sky is grand
and every figureâ the composition is filled !
with life. There is movement and' excite- I
ment everywbere. The distant waters of
the bay flash in the sun. ; But considered
historically there is little about it to tell
that it is what it pretends to be. The fig
ures are only "indicated," and of no value
to show the character of the people or the
costumes of the period. On the top of a
hill in the picture there is a large cross
that under the circumstances would be an
impossibility. In fact it is so gigantic it
would weigh many thousands of .pounds
and could not be put into position without
the aid of derricks and steam engines. As
a pictorial effect it is grand, but as a fact
of history it is an absurdity. - â¢
Mr. Pissis' picture is a creditable piece of
work in many ways. He has selected his
subject. to show a time after the first fall
rains have come. This -of course is all
right, but unless a person knew this he
would most surely take it for a spring
scene, so fresh and green are the hills and
trees. The distant mountains are splen
didly painted and produce . a most pleas
ing effect. The figures are not bo good.
They are poorly drawn and have little ex
pression. The costumes are all right ap
parently, and as far as the picture go?s it
represents the subject selected. The
horses in the picture are very poor, both
in color ana in drawing. .There is prac
tically no "anatomy" to them and the
way in which they are painted should be
some distance back in the picture instead
of close to the foreground.
A. W. Best selected his subject, "En
trance cf the -San Carlos' into the Bay of
ban * rancisco," but the work can hardly
be counted in the competition. There is
scarcely anything about it to suggest the
subject and the painting is so execrable as
to be unworthy of consideration.
Ihe rest of the exhibit consists of oil
paintings, water colors and pastels, in
each department of which there is some
good work. There are also a very few
etchings. Jules Pages' "Un coin de cui
sine a Montmartre" is one of the best oil
paintings shown, for the drawing j is . ex
cellent, and out of E the arparentlv hum
drum subject of an old-fashioned French
kitchen the painter has extracted some
exquisite color effects. : Robinson's "Fish
ln_ Boats at Twilight,* ism his usual style,'
the waves and sand are 'particularly good.'
Ernest C. Peixotto shows a portrait of a:
girl in a yellow dress against a green back-'
ground. The colors are cleverly handled
and the girl's head is strong, but the draw
ing of - the â¢ figure leaves ; something to-be
desired. Peixotto's ! nursery scene, which
hangs in tbe entrance hall, has some good
qualities, particularly 'in regard to color,
but it is banal in sentiment, and the
way in which the mother has her finger
laid against her nose hardly suggests a
wink.
There is nothing of the studio picture
about Joullin s studies of sand dimes.
They, are replete with the tints and atmos
phere of the , open, the color values being
particularly good. No. 100â "A Study"â
is one of the most charming landscape
bits. in the whole' exhibition. Yelland's
pictures are all in his usual style. One of
the most noticeable is "Evening in the
Hay Fields," with the red glow of depart
ing day. illuminating the landscape.
William Keith is well represented, and
his.pictures aroused the usual amount of
interest. "Summer Twilight in Sonoma
Valley" is a work which one seems to see
into, so excellently are the distances
painted. "The Oaks" has , nothing .par
ticular to distinguish it from Keith's
other oaks, but "April Showers" is rather
more panoramic than most of Keith's
work. Some especially good canvases
are -shown by Arthur Mathews. "Pan
dora" is a work that contains consider
able dramatic expression," and both the
drawing and flesh tints of the figure in the
foreground are strong. "Hagar and Ish
raael" is an interesting study of figures
and landscape. ~
Landscapes predominate in the exhibit,
and in the figure canvases, apart from the
portraits, the artists seem to have chosen
their models for their homeliness : rather
than their beauty. One of the fine fancy
sketches where* beauty is apparent is
Nellie F. Binckley's "Study.' Among
the landscapes Latimer lias some notice
able work. His' oil-painting, "A Smoky
Morning," is good, but the water-color,
"A Gray Day," is even better.
The work of Â£. M. Pissis attracted favor
able comment last night. His "Portrait"
is an interesting study of a girl's head,
and No. 55 is a very effective bit of \vood
land country.
John A. Stanton shows a good study of
a grisette sitting at the outdoor table of a
cafe. His "Evening Scene in Brittany" is
weird and peculiar. It represents a Cali
fornia landscape with a Brittany sunset â
the sunset of a country with long twilight,
which leaves an afterglow. There is a
rudely sculptured cross in the foreground,
near which sits peasant woman of excep
tional ugliness, whose big sabots are ag
gressively in evidence.
"Blue Gums and Poppies" is a rather
clever imitation of Monet, by S. H. Mc-
Crea. The purple mountains and trees
and vivid . green ; grass have a touch of
truthfulness to California scenery in early
spring time. "The Landscape," No. 19, by
Mollie G. Hutchinson, is another rather
clever work of the green-and-purple school.
Miss Helen Hyde's "Happy Thoughts"
is a candle-light study with some good
color effects ; her portrait, of Mrs. David
Bixler is a daring color design, but the re
-1 suit is a tryinglv crude background; the
â  drawing of the figure is not good, but the
j artist has succeeded with her head, which
lis a good likeness. .=â¢,>>
Cadenasso shows a j pretty portrait of
Mrs. Older. v . Â
Among the many other interesting oil
paintings, Mrs. M. T. Menton's "Mending
Billy's Boat" shows good quality.
Sidney Armer's "Foe on the Lupins"
is a pretty study in greens and grays.
Some good work is to be found in the j
water colors. Mrs. L. K. Mathews has an !
| especially good study of sky and sand at ;
Santa Barbara; and Gamble exhibits j
sketches around the bay which are deli
cate and artistic, as well as being a trans
cription of nature. ;TJgo Fischer's work is
in, his usual style, a little more conven
tional ; perhaps. ?, Pauline â¢ Dworzek has
I some, pretty work. ,In the pastels .Mrs.
Alice Chit-tendon shows a portrait of Mrs.
Irving M. Scott, which is excellently done
and is a striking likeness. J
There are a few works whose presence in
the exhibition can only be explained on
the grounds of ; a temporary mental aber
ration on the part of the hanging commit
tee^ No. 124, for 7> instance, has neither
sentiment nor technique to recommend'it.
The canvas represents a lady with features
askew gazing at an album in jj an impossi
bly green interior.;. On* either side of her
is a wooden child. No. 146 - deems like a
hysterital attempt to invest a cabbage
garden with: dramatic qualities is, if
the chunks of green in the foreground are
cabbages. A weird tree of a variety un
known to naturalists rises in the middle
distance and the background is left en
tirely to the beholder's imagination. It is
hard, too, to tell why No. 145 was hung,
for the drawing is bad and the colors are
impossible. yÂ£ y~y ; , ',:'.
There is much, however, to console the
beholder for a few bad pictures, Some of
the work done by the students is especially
excellent. J. Martinez's "An Indian Sculp
tor" is an especially clever study. Miss
M. Froeiich has also a good study.
Throwing the Discus.
Discus-throwing was a later and more
retined form of hurling the stone. In
Homeric times, and even at Olympia. a
stone or maos of iron was first used for the
purpose. This was held by a leathern
thong, swung in a circle and hurled as far
as possible. A circular or lenticular disk
of bronze was used at least as early as the
beginning of the fifth century. A stand
ard weight must, of course, be assumed
for the great eames. A discus now in the
British Museum, which seems to have
been used, weighs eleven pounds nine
ounces, but whether this was the standard
weight or not is not definitely known. The
thrower took his stand upon a slight ele
vation of limited circumference, where he
could have a secure foothold and was pre
vented from running; then, with a swing
of the arm and a corresponding movement
ofthe whole body, be hurled the discus as
far as possible. The value ofthe body
movement was recognized by the sculptor
Myron in his famous statue "The Disco
bolus," and is understood by the modern
athlete when he swings the hammer, or
even when he makes a drive at golf. As
for records at discus-throwing, Phayllus,
again, is said to have thrown the discus
ninety-five feet. â '-'The Old Olympic
Games," in the Century for April.

REGIE BEGINS
The Rainey -Daggett Side
Defeated and a Cinch
Played.
SULLIVAN IS THE KING.
The "Inside" Captures the Junta
and Packs All Power Into
One Ruler.
HOW HARNEY SAVED JIM BUDD
The Buckleyites Make a Great Silver
Play for the State Con
venticn.
The Rainey -Daggett people were knocked
out in a big meeting of the Junta's Demo
cratic general committee in Pioneer Hall
last night.
The vote was 197 to 133, with the Rainey
ites in the short end. Then the McNab-
Lanigan-Sullivan combination easily put
through a programme, which gives the
â¢entire management of everything, includ
ing primaries and the naming of election
officers, into the hands of Chaiiman Sulli
van. There is no further use for the gen
eral committee, and its members will have
little to say in the future. - The Raineyites
can be shut out everywhere, and now Lani
gan can get all he wants of what the Mc-
Nab coterie will be able to win.
This was brought about by the adoption
of a constitution which provided that the
chairman shall appoint a campaign com
mittee, which is given absolute power.
None ofthe Raineyi were given even a
look at the constitution before the meet
ing. It was agreed upon by McNab, Sul
livan, Hassett and Lanigan at a conference
in Hassett's office last Saturday night. It
was read once last night and put through.
The "inside" had hustled hard to get its
forces together, but the Raineyites had
struck several snags. Quite a number of
their men were away, several, including
Eddie Greany, being at the prize-fight.
On the floor Senator C. S. Arms and
J. A. Fenton led the defeated faction,
while Gavin McNab and Frank P. Hughes
hustled about, marshaling the anti-Rain
eyites.
A primary election was called for May
29, to elect State convention delegates, the
primary to be wholly run by the cam
paign committee, which Sullivan is to ap
point.
The meeting was long and warm, but
the programme was forced through with
out bloodshed.
.Sam Braunhart sat at the rear and
made three or four motions intended to
chuck the programme through with expe
dition, the first one being that the roll
call be dispensed with, but the Raineyites
rose in wrath, and the roll was called
by Secretary McGovern, while John Cun
ningham, the ex-secretary of C. A. Buck
ley, and now " assistant secretary, kept
tally. '
Frank P. Hughes bobbed up quickly at
the end of the rollcall with a motion that
the report of the committee on constitu
tion and by-laws be read.
J. A. Fenton wanted the delegation from
the Forty-iourth which had been agreed
upon as a compromise seated first, holding
that the Forty-fourt'i was entitled to a
voice in adopting the constitution. He
got in a point of order, which the chair
man overruled, ana he appealed from the
decision of the chair, evoking the first
roar of applause. Braunhart from the
rear fired forth a motion to lay the appeal
on the table, and when a rollcall was de
manded on the motion the test vote of the
meeting was begun.
The progress of tbe rollcall was watched
anxiously and when it was announced
that the motion was cairied by 197 to 133
the McNabers cheered and flushed with
victory. That vote took the heart out of
the Raineyites and a number went to the
prize fight or for drinks.
The constitution was read by Secretary
McGovern. But few of the delegates had
seen it. When Fenton the day before
asked McNab for the privilege of reading
the fateful document McNab replied, "Oh,
you will understand it at a glance."
"Well, we'd like to have the glance," re
plied Fenton unavailingly.
-The constitution is brief and simple and
imposes no fetters on the all-powerful
chairman. It provides for a lot of com
mittees to be appointed by the chairman
including a campaign committee and a
grieveance committee. The campaign
committee is to "manage all preliminary
campaign work for the interest of the
party."
Under the head of conventions it is
provided that no office-holderâ municipal,
State or Federalâ be eligible to mem
bership. This is intended to shut the Mint
and Fire Department people out of con
ventions. The constitution may be
amended by a majority vote of the whole
committee, thus making it necessary for
the Rainey element to win 226 votes to
change things around.
The chairman is given a club to preside
at meetings with in the shape of a provi
sion that he may impose a fine of not to
exceed $5 on any Democrat who gets un
ruly duringmeetings.
Hughes moved the adoption of the in
strument as a whole at once.
Fenton wanted to take up section by sec
tion the document that had been read but
once. . \
Eugene N. Deuprey appealed to Fenton
to let the process be expedited by con
fining discussion to the one section which
opposition was likely.
C. A. Reynolds urged that no man
could vote intelligently on a constitution
and by-laws after hearing it read once,
and he moved as- an amendment that 500
copies be printed and that it be laid over
until the next meeting.'
â  Ex-Senator Mead supported this and in
quired what the great hurry was. Then
frank P. Hughes, who helped get up the
document, made a fiery speech in favor of
cracking things through while the major
ity stood right. '
"I undei stand every section," he de
clared, and the Raineyites groaned. "There
is but one issue here and it is understood.
It should be met now and without flinch
ing. Our purpose is to rid San Francisco
of a set of corrupt bosses. Delay is wanted
so that a few more members of the com
mittee may be reached. This matter must
be met now.
The previous question shut off debate,
and a rollcall was demanded on Reynolds'
amendment that 500 copies be printed. It
was lost by a vote of 115 to 210, and then
the constitution was adopted by a big and
triumphant chorus of ayes to a few weak
noes from the defeated Raineyites.
The rest of the programme quickly fol
lowed. M. C. Hassett.'who has recently
become active with McNab, Lanigan and
Sullivan, and woo wants to name a public
official that he can be attorney for, offered
a resolution calling a primary election on
May 29 for th? selection of delegates to the
State Convention. This is all the provision
made in- the resolution, other than that
the campaign committee shall :go ahead
and â¦ hold it, with full power in ' every
thing. â  '\ '.'â â â¢'â ..
Fenton moved an amendment that elec
tion officers be chosen by the district clubs
instead of all being appointed by Sulli
van's campaign committee, but the chair
man ruled that such a proposition as that
was in conflict with the constitution and
hence not in order. . - y/-_.C:
C. S. Arms wanted to know if the cam
paign committee was to appoint all elec
tion officers and found that it was.
Hassett, in reply, said: "The campaign
committee to / be appointed by the chair
man is to manage the whole thing, fix the
number of delegates and so on. It is sup
posed that the chairman is able and
honest and will do that which is for
the interests of the party; that he will ap
point capable and honest men to exercise
this power. Now, gentlemen, is not that
fair? [Laughter.] The chairman should !
have this power and this committee should
be like the President's Cabinet and co
operate with him. Power should not be
put into the hands of irresponsible people
of the districts. I expect that this com- '
mittee will decide what to do and do it."
There were groans, and a member from
the Twenty-eighth said in disgust, "Well,
that's a good piece of gall."
"Does this contemplate that the cam
paign committee shall conduct this pri
mary and elect delegates without con
sulting this body?" inquired Clitus
Barbour in amazement.
'That's just it," said Hassett.
Then Senator Arms came down to the
front and maae his eloquent protest. â 
"It is said that the purpose of this l
movement is to shake the bosses out of
their shoes, and when they are shaken
out their shoes should be thrown
away that other bosses may not step into
them," he declared with Lanigan, McNab
and Sullivan in his mind. "We don't
want to put through a skin game here. If
there is to be a cinch primary with no rep
resentation for the minority it will bring
defeat. I ask that the minority be given
a chance to at least look on and see if their
votes are counted."
"This centralization of power is danger
ous. No boss ever rose to power except
by such centralization of power in a com
mittee which he could control. Such a
committee as is provided for here will be
more harsh and iniquitous than any boss
that ever lived." :,/,:-
Hassett said something, and some sar
castic ruffian in the rear sang out, "I rise
to a point of order. The chairman has
lull power, and you have no right to 1
speak." "yyy.
" "This resolution is very complimentary
to this committee," said C. A. Reynolds.
"It is introduced because you are not
honest enough to conduct a primary."
The chairman shut him up and made
the announcement that the minority
would be given some representation. Then
the resolution was adopted.
The battle being won, the Forty-fourth
row was settled by a vote to seat the com
promise delegation agreed upon in the
district the other night.
That was all but the row over Jim Budd.
Charles Wesley Reed started it by getting
in some resolutions referring to the long
standing opposition of the party to rail
road funding bills and calling upon
Governor Budd to voice the sen
timents of the people of California
to Congress and to render , active
support to Senator White and Congress
man Maguire in their battle with . the
pending "funding measure. Also to aid
the people of Los Angeles in their battle
for a harbor with the Southern Pacific
Company.
Not all caught the main point. It was
late, everybody wanted to go, and when
Reed said, "I desire to talk to you about
five minutes on this great question," the
audience groaned in dismay. But Reed
went on. .â¢-.;â¢
--"These resolutions," he said, "call upon
Governor Budd to redeem his ante-election
pledges in this matter. Ido not mean to
say that Governor Buad is in the railroad
camp, as has been said in some papers,
but I do say that since election no word
has passed his lips in opposition to what
in the campaign he declared night and
day he would fight."
"Is this an impeachment of Governor
Budd or a resolution ? It is out of order,"
shouted Frank P. Hughes, fiercely.
A hubbub began and in the. midst of it
Major Harney, who has an appointment
as port warden, rushed to the front and to
the Governor's rescue.
He pulled from his pocket some resolu
tions, which he happened somehow to
have with him, and' offered them as a
substitute, "without the impeachment of
the Governor of California," he observed.
The resolutions opposed the funding bill,
and in behalf of the general committee
urged Coneress to defeat the pending
measure. White and Maguire were in
dorsed and the Democratic county
committees of the State were asked to
take similar action.
"Governor Budd has fulfilled every
promise he has made to the people of this
State," declared Harney loudly from the
platform, and I am surprised to see a
member of this committee present resolu
tions here which impeach the integrity of
Honest Jim Budd."
The substitute was quickly adopted, and
the weary committee quickly adjourned
and broke for the door at 11:30 p. m.
BUCKLEYITES AT WORK.
They Adopt Strong Silver and Antl-
Funding Resolutions and Elect
an Executive Committee,
Everything went through smoothly at
the gathering of the Buckley hosts last
night in Odd Fellows' Hall. There was
not even a dissenting vote to any of the
numerous propositions which were put to
a ballot more as a formality than as a mat
ter to test the wishes of the members of
the general committee.
What was considered a master stroke in
the struggle to defeat the Junta delegation
before the Democratic State Convention at
Sacramento was the adoption of the reso
lutions by Andrew J. Clunie favoring free
silver coinage and opposing all measures
providing for tho refunding of the debt of
the Central Pacific and other railroads.
The principal business of the session was
the selection of an executive committee of
ninety, which is to have charge of the ap
proaching primaries and of the campaign
generally.
Nearly all the members of the Buckley
general committee of 450" were present
when Chairman Joseph Rothschild called
the committee to order. Rollcall was dis
pensed with, and after the reading and ap
proval of the minutes of the last meeting
Andrew J. Clunie presented the follow
ing resolution in favor of silver and against
any refunding measure, his appearance
being greeted with enthusiastic applause:
Resolved, That we, the general committee of
the Democratic party of the City and County
of San Francisco, do hereby declare that the
paramount issue at this time in the United
States is indisputably the money question;
and believing that the people of the United
States are thÂ© greatest and most enlightened
of any on earth, we declare ourselves to be in
favor of a distinctly American financial system.
We are unalterably opposed to. the single gold
standard, and demand the immediate return
to the constitutional standard of gold and
silver, by the restoration by this Governmedt,
independent of any foreign power, of the un
restricted coinage of both gold and silver into
standard money at the ratio of 16 to 1 and
upon terms of exact equality, as they existed
prior to 1873, and we hereby demand the in
sertion of a plant in the Democratic platform
of- the State of California and of the United
States, ih accordance with this declaration.
Resolved, That we as members of the general
committee of the Democratic party of the City
and County of San Francisco, voicing the sen
timent of thiJ Democracy of said City and
County, do hereby declare that we are in favor
of compelling the Central Paciflc Railroad
Company, and all other corporations, to dis
charge their honest obligations to the Govern
ment in like manner as private Individuals
are compelled to discharge their obligations
to one another.
That we- denounce the, so-called equities of
the Southern Paciflc Company, which have
been voiced by members of:. that corporation
and its hirelings for more than twenty years
in the State, as a stupendous fraud, and de
mand the insertion in the State and Nation*!
platforms of .the Democratic party of planks In
consonance with this declaration.
. It also provides i that all candidates for
delegates to the Democratic State Conven
tion pledge themselves to secure the inser
tion, of a silver plank in both the State
and - National Democratic < platforms. -to
secure a plank ?in the same' platforms
opposing . refunding, and not to vote

for any person as delegate to the National
Convention who â . does not agree to en
deavor to secure the . insertion of the
planks mentioned in the National plat
form, and who will not vote for the nomi
nation of silver. men : as President and
Vice-President in the National Conven
tion, yyyy
Speaking to the resolutions, Mr. Clunie
said that there were acknowledged dis
agreements in the local Democracy, and
that the men opposed to this committee
were not working in the interests of the
party. He denounced the Federal officers
appointed by Cleveland as betne self-seek
ing and endeavoring to further only their
own interests, even if disruption was the
result.
He referred to the recent action of the
Democratic State Central Committee in
recognizing the Junta as being an insult
not only to the Buckley committee, but to
the whole Democracy ofthe State. .- ;;; ; j
He concluded by saying that if the reso
lutions were :. adopted * the delegates who
were pledged as outlined therein would
be sure of recognition when they went to
the State Convention. The resolutions
were unanimously adopted.
T. J. Ford introduced a resolution, which
was unanimously adopted, declaring
against the proposed funding bill, de
nouncing the methods of the Southern
Pacific Company in endeavoring to have
such a measure passed, and thanking Sen
ator Stephen M.White and Congressman
James G. Maguire on behalf of the Demo
cratic party of San Francisco for their
"loyal fight against California railroad
monopolies." ' :?.';'' ; ; :
M. J. Donovan introduced a resolution
changing the basis of apportionment so as
to have it conform, as explained, to the
long-established rule of the Democratic
party of California. Tbe present basis of
apportionment of delegates to the State
Convention is eight delegates for each of
the eighteen Assembly districts and seven
teen at large, to be selected in any man
ner the general committee may deem best,
the total number assigned to San Fran
cisco being 161. Under the Donovan sug
gestion the apportionment is to be based
on the vote cast for Governor Budd, one
delegate for each 200 voters or fraction
thereof in excess of 100 as follows, leaving
one delegate to be elected at large:
Twenty-eighth Assembly DistrictâNum
ber of delegates, 9; Twenty-ninth, 10;
Thirtieth, 10; Thirty-first, 10; Thirty-sec
ond, 9; Thirty-third, 8; Thirty-fourth, 10;
Thirty-fifth, 6; Tbirtv-sixth, 11; Thirty
seventh, 11; Thirty-eighth, 9: Thirty
ninth, 9: Fortieth, 9; Forty-first, 9; Forty
second, 7; Forty- third, 8; Forty-fourth,
8 ; Forty-fifth, 7. Total, 160.
This was adopted, and; it was decided to
make nominations for delegates to the
State Convention on May 16, and to hold
the election for the same on May 28, be
tween the hours of 6 and 10:30 p. m.
A. F. Armstrong introduced a resolu
tion, which was adopted, requesting dis
trict committees to send to the secretary
at once the places for enrollment in the
various districts on April 29 and 30 and
May 1 and 2. '-'yfy
The constitution was amended so as to
have the executive committee comprise
ninety members, five from each Assembly
district, one to.be appointed from each
district by the president of the general
committee and the other four from each
district by the respective district members
of the general committee. By the same
amendment the former campaign and
grievance committees were abolished. Re
cess was taken for the selection of the
members of the executive committee by
the various districts after Chairman

FOREST FIRES RAGING.
Several Massachusetts Villages Are in
Great Danger of Total
Destruction.
SANDWICH, Mass.. April 16.â The for
est fire is still raging fiercely all around
the town and is gaining great headway in
spite of the efforts of the large force of
fighters who are making heroic efforts to
check it.
Fbrestdale, one of the villages of Sand
wich, was this morning entirely sur
rounded by fire. Judging from the direc
tion the tiro is taking at present several of
the houses in the village of East Sandwich
may receive a scorching at least.
At the other end of the fire in the west
ern part of the town the flames have ap
proached to within a few miles of the
boundary lines, and are making very rapid
progress. It is mere guesswork to try to
form any idea as to when the fire will be
checked. It is spreading in every direc
tion. Old men who have lived here all
their lives say they never saw such a con
flagration before, and tbe loss of woodland
will be greater by far than ever before.
Word was received this afternoon that
the summer residence of Dr. Wesselhoeft,
in Sandwich, has been burned. The resi
dence of James Lowell also caught fire, but
the flames were extinguished.

AN UNPLEDGED
DELEGATION
Opinions Expressed by Many
Well-Known Repub
licans.
AGAINST INSTRUCTION.
Delegates Should Be Free to
Exercise Their Judg
ment.
THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST.
Men of High Character and Personal
Influence Should Go to
St. Louis.
The editorial article in The Call, en
titled "An Unpledged Delegation," was
widely read yesterday and freely discussed
by Republicans. Judging from individual
expressions of opinion last evening, The
Call reflected the sentiment of a large
majority of leading men of the party.
David Bush said : "It is better that a
delegation should go: to St. Louis un
pledged. Unquestionably California Re
publicans, by, a large majority, prefer the
nomination of McKinley, and it might be
well for the convention at Sacramento to
express that preference without instruct
ing the delegates to vote for him. Some
margin should be left for the delegates to
deliberate. Conditions now unforeseen
may occur and a delegation should be
allowed to exercise " its judgment for the
interests of the State. California comes
early on the call of the roll of States."
Henry Clement remarked that his per
sonal preferences were for Allison, whom
he regarded as a statesman in the true
sense of the wordâ a man whose strength,
ability and influence had long been recog
nized by the leading men of both the po
litical parties. As much as he preferred
Allison he believed that California should
send to the St. Louis convention an un
pledged delegation. He maintained that
a pledged delegation, instructed to cast its
vote for one candidate, went to a conven
tion shorn of all influence. In politics the
unexpected frequently happens, and to
keep in line with changing conditions the
delegates should be left free to caucus
among themselves and cast the weight of
their influence in the direction which
promised the greatest services to the Repub
lican cause, and the greatest good to the
Pacific Coast.
â â¢â  M. H. Weed said: "The delegation from
California should certainly go unpledged.
What is the sense of tying up the dele
gates with instructions to vote for any one
man-? Let them go to St. Louis, talk with
other delegations and form opinions as to
what they should do after they have care
fully studied the situation. ; ; A tied-up
delegation can swing no influence."
Judge Waymire, who is an outspoken
McKinley man and is leading the Ohio
candidate's fight in California, said: "It
is my opinion that the Republican con
vention should instruct the delegates from
this State to vote for McKinley. He is
surely the first choice of California Re
publicans, and I believe that he will be
nominated on the first ballot."
F. W. Van Sicklen believed that the del
egation should be left free to exercise its
judgment and exert an influence for the
benefit of the State. He said: "A dele
gation going to a convention pledged to
support one candidate is at the start de
prived of strength. The California dele
gates should be left free to form an alli
ance with other State delegations from
the Pacific Coast. If all the Pacific Coast
delegations could unite a powerful force
might be exerted for the benefit of the in
terests of this region."
William Sproule remarked "It should
be accepted beyond question at the outset
that all the candidates mentioned are rep
resentative men of the highest character,
and that each one is worthy to fill the office
of President. Therefore the delegates from
California to the St. Louis convention
should be unhampered by pledges. They
should be allowed to exercise their judg
ment, and be left free to confer with' other
delegations and grasp every advantage
presented for the benefit of the State."
George Bromley expressed his opinion
in this sentence: "I think the California
delegation to the St. Louis convention
should be instructed to vote for McKin
ley."
Henry K. Field said: "I am opposed to
pledging delegates. They ought not to be
tied up with instructions to support any
particular candidate. The proper thing to
do is to send to St. Louis men of high
character, good judgment and individual
influence. When they get there let them
judge for themselves what course they
should pursue to promote party success
and gain aavantaees for the State they
represent. Why, the little State of Ver
mont wields greater influence than Cali
fornia in National affairs.; Her beat men
are sent to ; conventions and they are per
mitted a margin for the exercise of a
judgment which can only be correctly
formed by immediate observation." .
Frank Reynolds was convinced that the
sentiment of Republicans in California
favored the nomination of McKinley, but
he said: : "lam not in favor of pledging
the delegation. No one can tell now what
will happen at St. Louis. The party at
present seems strong enough to elect any
good candidate, but. ...conditions" may
change and it may become necessary to
study the availability of a Â£ candidate.
California Republicans . have made mis
takes in the past by pledging the delega
tions for favorite candidates. Let us have
a delegation of able men and trust to their
judgment." -"â â â¢â

TOM SHARKEY A WINNER
Choynski Failed to Stop the
Sailor in an Eight-Round
Bout.
The Police Stopped the Contest in the
First Round, Choynski Bsing
Disabled.
A large crowd witnessed the eight-round
glove contest between Tom Sharkey and
Joe Chbyiiski last evening at the People's
Palace Theater.
At 10 o'clock exactly Tom Sharkey and
his attendants, Danny Needham and Tim
McGrath, put in an appearance. Sharkey
looked in fine condition, but was drawn
down considerably in flesh. His eyes
looked dull from a course of hard train
ing. He said that he felt "O-K,": and
would fight for his life. . yU-y ? '
Joe Choynski with his football bangs
soon followed. He was looked after by
Ed Graney and J. Carkeek. v .;â  Kiv..*. "
Joe wore * confident look and smiled
when the audience gave him a
hearty reception.
Some argument resulted as regards a
decision in case the contest 3hould be
stopped by the police before the end of the
eighth round. >
The contestants finally decided to leave
the question at issue to the option of the
referee, Albert King, who was mutually
chosen to referee the match.
Â- After the referee had cautioned the box
ers not to resort to foul lighting be gave
the signal to the time-keepers and time
was called for the first round. The condi
tions were that to win the long end ofthe
purse Choynski had to stop Sharkey in
eight rounds. "â¢-->â¢ -yy
The Bailor looked anxious as he met his
opponent in the center of the ring.
Joe immediately assumed the aggressive
part and sailed in to Knock the nose off
Sharkey's handsome face. The latter, un
der instructions . from "Spider" Kelly, one
of .his attendants, played a defensive game
and backed away from the hard-hitting
Joseph.
Nearing the end of the round Choynski
cornered the sailor in the southeast end of
the ring and a rally resulted. Sharkey re
ceived a stiff upper cut from Joe's right in
the chin and in an attempt to get away
from further damage he smashed at
Choynski with his left and missed.
The blow was instantly followed by an
upper-cut. but : Sharkey struck wild, and
being close up to his opponent, he struck
Choynski" in the groin. The receiver
doubled up like a jack-knife in pain, and
his, second, Eddie Graney, ran to his as
sistance. : ;
\ The attendants of Sharkey then jumped
into the ring and pandemonium reigned
for a" few minutes. -Finally, Captain Bird
sail took a hand -in the dispute and or
dered everybody," excepting the contest
ants, outside the ropes. '
Choynski evidently received a hard and
painful blow which he acknowledged was
unintentional on the part of his opponent.
The spectators were growing impatient
and anxious as to the result, but when
Choynski rose from his seat and signified
to the referee by a motion of his hand tbat
he was ready : to proceed, a wild cheer
shook the rafters of the old building.
The rounds up to the finish were almost
a repetition. ".'â¢ Sharkey was satisfied to re
main on the defensive, expecting thereby
to win the decision. Choynski tried vari
ous moves to draw his opponent out, but
the sailor did % not attempt to play an ag
gressive part I until the last round, when
he mixed matters up with Joseph.
From the second to the seventh rounds
Choyinski frequently caught Sharkey on
the neck with left-handers and the sailor
was sent on all fours at least a dozen times,
but the fact that he was always on the re
treat when hit by Joseph the blows were
not of the punishing kind. ..-
The contest proved beyond dobbt that
to stop a fighter who battles on the de
fensive in a limited round-contest is a con
tract which few pugilists can I successfully
accomplish, especially if the aggressor is
physically the equal of his opponent. ."
In the eighth and last round Choynski
made a desperate attempt to drop his
punishing right on Sharkey's jaw. He
closed in upon the sailor and hot fighting
at close quarters resulted. ...
.*" Sharkey dropped: on his knees several
times to avoid being knocked out, and for
this mark of cowardice he â  was hooted by
the supporters of fair fighting.
As the round was drawing to a close the
sailor mixed things up with his opponent
and in a rally, that ' followed he landed a
few stiff blows on Choynski's: neck. < The
latter was hitting wild when some person
shouted "time.".
The seconds of the pugilists jumped into
the ring and separated the contestants.
Referee King announced that as Choynski
failed to stop his opponent in eight rounds
he awarded the contest to Tom Sharkey. ;
The betting last evening closed with
Choynski a favorite at $10 to $8. The gen
eral opinion : after the fight was that if
Sharkey had not run away from his oppo
nent Choynski would have won the con
test. Neither of ', the pugilists ' bore any
marks of punishment. â¢ .'..\ '
DELEGATES WHO
SLIPPED IN MUD
Many of Kelly and Ma
honey's Tools Feel Just
Like That.
THOUSANDS OF FRAUDS.
More Than Seven Thousand
Staffers' Ballots Are Their
Warrants.
SOME WILL SLIDE OUT OF IT.
.
They Do Not Relish Bending: Low
That Martin Kelly and Jerry
Mahoney May Rise.
The delegation from Martin Kelly and
J. H. Mahoney which is expected to knock
at the doors of the Republican State Con
vention hall on May 5 will be largely a
proxy delegation, and it will also be short
a few votes.
The majority of the sixty-five who have
been named by Kelly and Mahoney as the
ones they are to play in an effort to lay
hold of some scraps of local political
power are feeling a little as though they
had slipped in the mud and didn't know
just what to do about it.
They are riot telling people that they
were elected by 7643 of the Republican
votes in the Fourth Congressional Dis
trict. The big vote is not being paraded.
The delegates comprise two classes of men.
Some of them are small professional poli
ticians whose lives are passed holding or
seeking little patronage jobs, who are al
ways allied with snme district boss and
who stand in with the "push." Others
are politically respectable as politics go,
and have suffered their names to be used
because of personal friendship or in pay
ment of political debts.
Some of the "push" element may be
really proud of those 7643 votes, 7343 of
which represent the stuffing of the ballot
boxes and returns. But a majority of tbe
others turn shamed from the world's stuff
ing record. Knowing that on last Tues
day every one of the eleven polling-places
was practically deserted all day; that not
300 legitimate votes were cast in the ag
gregate; that the few members of the
push who attended to the repeating were
not industrious enough to provide a re
spectably laree vote, and that when the
polls closed a few hundred extra votes
were deliberately and openly tallied in
each district, they rather shrink from ap
pearing in the highest council ofthe party
with the most stupendous primary fraud
in municipal history as their warrant, and
with two such infamous tricksters as
Kelly and Mahoney as their creators and
sponsors. - .- , ; -â¢
â  Many of them, too, do not just like the
idea of bending low their shoulders that
Martin Kelly, Jerry Mahoney and those
who herd with them may mount thereon
and : surmount the wall of political de
cency which now guards the party and
the City's official affairs from their cor
rupting and dangerous power. : .
So it is that 'many of the delegates are
scratching their heads, hinting about re
signing or expecting to be unable to go to
Sacramento. Kelly and Mahoney will in
duce as many as possible of these to keep
quiet and let their proxies be used.
William Offermann of the Thirty-first
District, who is a grocer at Tenth and
Howard streets, says that he did not care
to make â  known at present why he con
sented to bis name being used. He does
not expect, however, to go to Sacramento
when the State Convention meets. Mr.
Offermann said yesterday he had the ut
most confidence in John D. Spreekels as a
leader of the party, and was sure that Mr.
Spreekels deserved , the support of good
citizens.
Henry McClure, another so-called dele
gate from the Thirty-first Assembly Dis
trict, has rooms for his family in Mr.
Offermann's house, although McClure is in
fact a resident of Sacramento. He for
merly resided in this City and was em
ployed by the Central Pacific as head
watchman. Lou Brown, Secretary of
State, gave him a job in the Capitol
grounds. . The Legislature makes, liberal
appropriations every session to keep the
Capitol grounds in trim, and the Secretary
of State is entitled to give out some of the
pie. McClure came down from Sacra
mento a few days ago and remained in the
City over night. He got himself on Jere
Mahoney's ticket, and perhaps got the
promise of a few proxies to distribute as
his friends should desire.
The Kelly-Mahoney list of delegates con
tains the names of many who were for
merly employed in various departments of
the- City or i State government and the
Southern Pacific ' Railroad. G. W. Bay
reuther .was a plumbing inspector, F. A.
Koegel was a;' health inspector, G. W.
Pratt was a deputy under Sheriff Laumeis
ter. These, like others, owed their patron
age jobs to Martin Kelly.
W. Michelsen, elected on the "blanket
ticket" from the Thirty-ninth District,
used to be a Democrat. He is proprietor
of the livery stable on Ellis street, near
Larkin, and through Supervisor * King re
ceived the contract for keeping two of the
police patrol wagons jin his i stable. So be
was willing to reciprocate. , Ri G. Falk, an
other nominee, is well remembered as Ray
Falk of the Registrar's office, and long one
of Mahoney's political friends.
Dr. Joseph ; Artigues, ; whose name ap
peared on the Mahoney ticket under a bide
pencil mark, declared yesterday that he
knew nothing about the matter till told
by a friend that he was a nominee from
the Forty-fourth Assembly District. In
stantly he cailed A. Ruef by telephone.
"What does this mean?"
"That's- all right, doctor. You stand
with us?" '_ \ â â ; -.
"No, sir. You stand with yourself. I'll
have ' nothing to do with , this ticket. I
don't belong to your faction. I won't
have my name on that ticket." J .-
Bang! and the telephone shook.
The doctor's name was scratched.
N. : Ferrogiaro is a retired vegetable gar
dener, who was asked to run on the Kelly-
Mahoney ticket. He answered "all right,"
and his friends say he did not Know what
the ticket meant. So long as it was a Re
publican ticket he thought it was "all
right."c y
In the Forty-fifth District, Joe King's
henchmen comprised the delegates. John
Hayes was appointed on - the Harbor po
lice through King's influence with Har
bor Commissioner Cbadbourne. Joseph
Spohn was appointed gardener of the
plaza by King in the Board of Supervisors.
Thomas B. O'Brien lives in the Interna
tional Hotel, and acts as adviser to the
Supervisor of the First Ward, who is his
overruling Providence, having put him in
one of the Police courts as a clerk. -â ? '?
The Mahoney-Kelly delegates, calling
themselves the Fourth Republican Con
gressional delegation, held a meeting in
the Flood building last evening. It was
called to order by Joseph S. Spear Jr., who
was afterward chosen permanent chairman
of the so-called delegation. Brief speeches
were made by A. Ruef, H. I. Kowaisky
and T. B. O'Brien.
On the motion to effect a permanent or
ganization Kowaisky nominated Spear for
chairman, and Mahoney nominated Abra
ham Ruef for vice-chairman and Bernard
and James McCabe and M. J. Doian for
sergeanti-at-arms. These were all elected
unanimously. y '
On motion of Senator Mahoney a recess
was taken to prepare nominations for
chairman of the district delegations, which,
upon reconvening, were named as follows:
Twenty-eighth District, Jacob Lewis; Twen
ty-ninth, George Keefe; Thirtieth, M. W.
Coffey; Thirty-first, William Asmussen : Thirty
second, J. W. Darragh; Thirty-third, J. F. Sul
livan; Thirty-ninth, R. G. Falk; Forty-second,
Charles J. Gavin; Forty-third, If. I. Kowaisky;
Forty-iourth, J. Browell; Forty-fifth, Thomas
B. O'Brien. -
At this juncture a motion was made to
exclude newspaper reporters, which was
unanimously adopted and the balance of
the proceedings were conducted as a star
chamber. y'y":'- :-y '. '
DISAPPEARED IN CHICAGO.
S. B. Hibben, a Prominent Resident of Los
Angeles, Suddenly Drops Out
of Sight.
CHICAGO, 111., April 16.â B. Hib
ben, a prominent and wealthy citizen of
Los Angeles, Cal.. dropped out of sight in
Chicago to-day and the efforts of a dozen
detectives to find him have proved un
availing. â¢;. â -'; â 
Mr. Hibben is manager of the Arizona
Sandstone Company of Santa Ana, Cal.,
and with his wife lives at 345 South Hill
street, Los Angeles. The company of
which Mr. Hibben is manager and a large
stockholder is one of the largest concerns
in California, and has furnished the stone
for nearly all the public, buildings in tho
State.
Last December Mr. Hibben underwent
a surgical operation and sin cc has acted
strangely. He was taken to Sun Fran
cisco for medical treatment, but as he did
not improve it was decided to bring him ta
Chicago. This morning he arrived in th
city accompanied by his wife and sister
and secured rooms at the Metropolitan
Hotel. y-y.
Soon after their arrival at the hotel Mr.
Hibben said he would go to the barber
shop underneath the hotel and get shaved*
As he did not return in an hour his wife
became anxious and went to look for him.
She learned that a man answering her
husband's description had been shaved in,
the barber-shop and had returned later,
apparently confused, and inquired where
his hotel was.- yy

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
day.-; those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
ls usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
a-:. When the pressure is high in the interior
ana low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" ls Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
"able. With a "high" in he vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California" coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather In -winter. he reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

Financial. -
NEW YORK, N. V., April 16.â The feature of
speculation at the Stock Exchange to-day was
American sugar, which sold up to 125%.' the best
figure attained since the current bull campaign set
in. There were no new developments to account for
the further rise in the stock. Brokers credited with
acting for inside interests were again heavy
buyers. â  The rise was stimulated by purchases for
the short account, Tobacco was less prominent,
and ranged between 68 and 69 3 g, closing at 68%-
General Electric was weak, and fell from 37% to
36%. The . stock lacked support. Chicago Gas
was also heavy, and fell to 69.'
The railway list developed greater strength than
of late and belter prices were . recorded. Local
'commission houses were buyers of the Grangers
â  Louisville and Nashville and the low-priced issues.
An Important development was the inquiry for
railway and miscellaneous bonds. Foreign houses
â¢ were buyers of the low-priced mortgages. In the
late dealings a disposition to accept profits in the
Industrials was manifested, but the railway list
held firm. Total sales. 193,500 shares. " Net
changes show gains of V.@is/ g percent outside of

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., April 16.-Wheat was again
irregular and erratic to-day. At no period of the
session was any sign or evidence given that in
terest was being taken by any one outside of the
circle of traders and they were unsettled in their
convictions and opinions: enough so to cause
prices to display weakness under pressure of sell
ing or strength when the demand became ap
parently of more consequence than the offerings.
Little news was received. The Cincinnati Price
Current in its weekly summary of the crop condi
tion stated that more favorable reports were being
received. A fuller resume of the situation by that
publication was received later and in commenting
on the Government report for March it said that
the yield of winter heat would be In the neigh
borhood of last year's.
This set the shorts to covering and was responsi
ble for temporary firmness. Liverpool cables were
l/id higher. Receipts at Chicago were 18 cars and
114,854 ousheis.were taken from store. The
Northwest had 296 cars against 229 last Thursday
and 154 a year ago. Good export clearances, 515,
--400 bushels, helped the market for a time, but the
action lacked vim. Closing Continental cables
were irregular. May wheat opened from 65yic to
66 i g@6s l sold between 6dyg@6sV_@b6c, clos
ing at 65%@66%c. V4Â®% c higher than yesterday.
Estimated receipts tor to-morrow 18 can.
CORNâ Nothing eventful occurred in corn.
From start to finish its tone was regulated by that
of wheat, "shorts'' buying when it displayed
strength and holders becoming sellers when weak
ness was threatened. The lucsy possessors of
calls were enabled to obtain a slight profit this
morning, and as privileges have not been particu
larly remunerative in this grain recently, they
were not slow to avail themselves of the oppor
tunity. Receipts were 144 cars, and 287,207
bushels were taken from store. Liverpool cables
dull and steady. Export clearances amounted to
93.288 bushels. May corn opened at 30yÂ«@30V4c,
sold between SOS'sC and 3iy B e, closing at 30 t_
303/80, Vs c higher than yesterday. Estimated re
ceip.s lor to-morrow 225 cars.
OATSâ Followed the example of wheat and corn,
advancing when they did and declining on any
show or weakness. Not much trade took place.
Receipts were 202 cars. There were no with
drawals from store. May closed y Ã c higher than
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 197
cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash, 92c; May, 833,;Â©
89V_c; July, 91c; September, 93Â©93^_c. Receipts
were 16 cars. - â¢
PROVISIONSâ market was. weak on its
own conclusions and weak, in sympathy, with
hogs. Professionals do not display any confidence
and the outside shows no Interest. | Trading was
only of moderate proportions to-day. Pork rallied
before the close on fair buying, but lard and ribs
remained weak. May pork, closed 2i_c higher;
May lard 5c lower and May ribs 2 1 , 2 @sc lower.

HIDES, TALLOW, WOOL AND HOPS.
HIDES AND SKINSâ The circular of W. R.
Sumner <fe Co. is as follows: '-Our Hide and
Leather market continues very quiet and prices
remain about the same as those which have been
quoted., Values generally are weaker, and the out
look for the Hide and Leather market for the next
two or three months is not encouraging. Wet
salted Hides remain about the same, but prices
have been sustained from the fact that very few
Hides have been coming into market rather than
by any activity in business. Tanners, therefore,
are working in less quantities and are more careful
in their selection and buying. Dry Hint Hides are
weaker at lower prices. The dry Hide market in
the East is very dull and prices Gradually tending
downward. We. therefore, are obliged" to quote
dry Hides at about lc less. Dry Kips continue
very dull and are worth about 2c leÂ»s than dry
flint Hides. Horsehldes are nominal and very few
purchases are made of this class of stock, i Wool
and sheep skins are more quiet and rule at lower
figures. Deerskins are very quiet, and the only
stock that is in demand at* the present time are;
the summer and medium skins. The poor' and'

WOOLâ A local circular says: "The local mar
ket continues to 'hang fire,' and no relief or active
trade con be expected so long as the markets on
the Atlantic seaboard continue Inactive, as has
been the case all winter. Business must be active
and the outlook fairly promising at that end be
fore much can be done on the Pacific Coast. We
have no new buyers to renor:, nor is there any
thing doing in a local way except in year's Wool, a
moderate share of which has been taken by one of
the principal scourers. Wool receipts average 700
to 800 bags per day, and out of these arrivals not
over 10% finds buyers. The latest advices from
Boston are. very discouraging, so much so that
local shippers who would be inclined to deal
largely while Wools can be had so cheap have no
spirit for speculation, expecting from the tone of
their latest telegrams that prices will be lower
rather than â¢â  higher before business -In Wool
throughout the country assumes a more active
phase. No sales." We quote Spring Nevada, 6@9c;

19,635. The world's visible supply April 1 was
2,634,670 bags, against 2,764.094 April 1.1895.
The circular says: "The market continues steady
and demand fairly active. Dealersjnave paid more
attention to Costa Rica than 10 other sorts in view
of the prospect of diminishing receipts from that
quarter and the desire on their part to buy while
stocks still afforded good assortments. . wood and
superior unwashed Halvadors have shown an un
dercurrent of strength not fell by any other de
scription, lt Is generally believed the crop of that
country will be heavily short of last year's â esti
mates running from 40% to 60% lessâ and at one '
period a large business was possible, had importers
been disposed to let go their modern c holdings at !
current prices. As it is, the tension of the past I
week has been relieved by the arrival of, the A ca- I â¢
pulco, and by advices of cargoes afloat per Zea
landia and San Jo<e, although dealers are cvi- -
dently ready to buy if offered even very slight in
ducements. Washed Salvadors have not in any
way improved but follow in â¢ the wake of Guatema
!as of similar quality. The latter occupy. their I
former position, and are still in good demand for ! '
overland shipment, To-day's stock Is 1789 Costa

In the Savage mine, on the 900 level, they are
still extracting some ore below the sill floor of the
north prospecting drift, from th-Â» west crosscut on
the eighth floor of the north upraise, and are doing
other exploratory work. On . the .50 level they
continue to drift north and south on the stratum of
ore passed through in east crosscut 1 and are tak
ing out some fair grade ore from this streak. Dur
ing the week they hoisted 39 carloads of ore, the
average assay of which was $24 56 per ton.
The west crosscut on the 110 level of the Ed
wards shaft, in the Occidental Con. mine has been
driven to date some 30 feet through a quartz for
mation assaying from $3 to $10 per ton, and aver
aging about $7 per ton' in gold.- As soon the
footwall Is reached the sinking of the shaft will be
resumed, and it is estimated that at a further
depth of about 25 feet the downward continuation
ot this quartz formation will be intersected. Â y
â ' In the Bodie Consolidated mine the top of up
raise above the north drift on the 200 level still
shows a width of 4 feet of low grade quartz. The'
top of ' the upraise from north drift 2, same level,

â  General Webb. of Gettysburg:. .
Brevet Major-General Alexander Stewart
Webb went into the war as a captain, and
all his promotions were for gallantry on
the field of battle. He participated in
seventeen different actions, i among them
being Mecnanicsville, Antietam, Chancel
lorsville, 'Gettysburg, Spottsyivania and
the Wilderness. His conduct at Gettys
burg is particularly noteworthy for its
daring and absolute fearlessness- He was
in command of the Second- Brigade, of the
Second Division of the Second "Corps. He
had been with the color-guard of the Sev
enty-second .Pennsylvania Volunteers, of
whom' every man was either killed or
wounded. General Webb, when he left the
stricken guard, went across the fron of
the companies to the right of the. Sixty
ninth Pennsylvania, all the way between
the lines, in order to direct the tire of the
latter regiment upon a company of rebels
who had, under the leadership of General
Armi^tead. sprang over the low stone wall
behind which they bad been ambushed,
and" were starting for a charge. He
brought on : himself the fire of the rebels
and received a wound in the groin. He
remained in the saddle directing his men
and holding them up to their work until
more* than half were killed or , wounded.
General Meade, in his letter presenting -a
medal to General Webb, mentions this act
as one not surpassed by any general in the
held.â Records of the War.

FOR PRESIDENT
Mayor Sutro Promises to
Support Him at St.
Louis.
MANY REQUESTS MADE.
Populist Organs in Many Dis
tricts Booming the Alameda
County Man.
ASKED TO GIVE HIS VIEWS.
He Crit ; zes the Omaha Platform and
Declares That It Is the Long-
Lcoked-For Panacea.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,!
908 Broadway, April 15. J
Colonel E. M. Gibson, an ex-Judge and
ex-Dictrict Attorney of Alameda County,
has received many letters and newspaper
articles during the past few days asking
him about and referring to his candidacy
as a People's party candidate for President
before the St. Louis Convention.
Many organs of the party have already
selected the old soldier as a likely candi
date, and are already booming him. Mayor
Sutro has seen Colonel Gibson and has
promised him his support, and he is now
actively pushing the name of the Alameda
County man.
"I have been asked by men high in the
councils of the party to go before the con
vention," said the colonel to-day, "and I
am not at all opposed to doing so. Mr.
Sutro told me recently that he had heard
my name mentioned in connection with
the St. Louis Convention, and he has prom
ised to vote for me. should he go as a dele
pate. I do not care to discuss the matter
a great deal, but I have been asked re
cently to outline my ideas, so that the
party leaders may be sure of their man.
Whether my opinion of the Omaha plat
form proves satisfactory or not I do not
know, but this is a copy of the declaration
that will either take me to the White
House or leave me here:
Money is a creature of law. It is money be
cause the law makes it money, and not other
wise. Money not made by Congress as the con
stitution directs is not legal. Allot our money,
whether gold, silver or paper, should be of
equal valueâ that is, a silver or paper dollar
should be equal in value to a gold dollar and a
legal lender in payment of all debts.
The law should be that any contract or prom
ise to pay an obligation in any particular kind
of money is void, and notwithstanding such
agreement, payable in lawful money of the
United States.
I am strongly devoted to the Omaha plat
form. It is briefâ so than the platform of
any other party. It is unequivocal and sound.
Lincoln's idea was that a party should take up
only the most important issues and dispose of
one at a time, which I think is correct. It is
. not well to have too many irons in the fire at
one time. We should not scatter, but unite
and concentrate our forces on one or two of the
most important issues.
' The Omaha platform demands the free and
unlimited coinage of silver and gold at the
ratio of lti to 1, and we must not swerve from
. tnis petition.. -We further demand a National
currency, safe. Bound and flexible, issued by
the Government only, a full legal tender for
â¢ all debt*, public and private. This is strictly
in harmony with our National constitution,
which provides that Congress shall have power
to coin money and regulate the value thereof,
which, correctly interpreted, means that Con
gress is the only power that can make legal
money, whether it be gold, silver or paper.
The Omaha platform demands that the
amount of money be speedily increased to $50
per capita. This would immediately relieve
the distressed condition of our country and re
store prosperity. The reduction of the volume
of money per capita which was caused by de
monetizing silver, the destruction of green
backs and our increase in population is the
principal cause of our hard times. Remove the
cause by increasing the volume of money and
hard times will vanish. The policy of the two
old parties is depressive. Its fruits are shrink
age in property values, reduction of wages, de
creased demand for labor, idleness, tramps,
sleepless nights, worry, gray hairs, premature
old age, bankruptcy, decay, gloom and despair.
The fruits of our policy are increase in prop
erty values, increased demand for labor, bet
ter wages, increased consumption of food
products and clothing, payment of debts, gen
eral prosperity, confidence,' courage, patriot
ism, health, life and happiness. One is slow
death, the other vigorous life.
The constitution says Congress shall have
power to establish postoffices and post roads.
Congcess has established postoffices, and our
postal system is an honor and blessing to the
country, and we believe that Congress should
now establisn post roads. In other words, that
the Government should own all railroad,
telegraph and telephone lines, ana that the
management of the same should be taken ab
solutely out of politics ; that a uniform system
of freights and fares should be fixed, and there
tvould be no favoritism shown to any person,
party or class: no secret rebates by means of
which some are dishonestly enriched while
others are ruined; no traveling on passes by
bloated, scheming politicians.while the honest
toiler pays three fares. In other words, we are
In favor of the enforcement of the constitution
md laws, fully, justly and fairly.
We believe in the teachings of Washington,
Jefferson and Lincoln. They were wise, pa
triotic and honest. They believed in honestly
-dministering the constitution and laws for
â¢ the protection and benefit of all. Now the cor
porations, trusts and plutocrats are running
the Government In their own interest, and the
people are crushed and suffering. This condi
tion cannot last. I have faith that our party
â¢ will succeed. The great bod y of the people are
lonest. The work of education is going on.
The struggle may be long and tedious and bur
lensome, but let us, each one of us, do our
Juty as good citizensâ bo faithful to the con
ititution and the laws, and the just God to
'horn Washington and Lincoln appealed in
the dark hours of our country's troubles here
tofore will ultimately lead us to a higher,
itronger and firmer National life.
STEPHEN LITTLE 13 ANGRY.
Che Banker Receives a Dressing Down
From Attorney Kelvin.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 16.â Stephen
Little, the Dixon banker who was bunkoed
jut of $7500 by the gold brick swindlers,
.as positively refused to swear to a com
plaint and informed Judge Wood and
Prosecuting Attorney Melvin to-day that
te would not be in attendance at the trial
lext Saturday, but was warned that if he
ailed to come an officer would be sent alter
Jim and he would have contempt to an
swer for. y : . %
"You have already put this county to
â¢he expense of $590 by your stubbornness,"
iaid Mr. Melvin.
"".ou must think that I am a fool,"
â¢eplied Little.
"Well. 1 have about come to that con
tusion," was Melvin's rejoinder.
"If you do not have ft care I will have
rou before the Grand Jury to be invesit
rated on the charge of compounding a
elony- I believe, sir, you have received a
>art of this money back from the gold brick
i^n."
"Before the Grand Jury? I'd bet you
1,000,000â if I liad itâ that I have not re
vived a cent, not a cent," replied Little,
rith a slight tremor in his voice. "What
lo you think I am? I am not eoin<Â» to
â wear to something that is not true." Â°
"I told you what I thought of yon a little
rhile ago," said Melvin.
'â¢I think the same of you," said the Dix
iii hanker.
"I consider such an opinion from such a
nan a compliment," replied the prosecut
ing attorney. "If you are not down here
in time Saturday you'll come down under
.rrest"
' Lincoln Liberty Tree.
CENTERVILLE, Cal., April 16.â The pu
pils of Lincoln School district are oil ready
for a big time to-morrow (Friday). For some
time past they have been making exten
sive arrangements to plant a Lincoln lib
erty tree on the schoolhouse grounds simi
lar to that planted by the Lincoln School
of Oakland a year ago. Now all is ready,
and the great event will occur to-morrow.
Much interest has been aroused, and there
will be a large gathering of interested par
ents and friends.
The address of the day will be delivered
by Major E. A. Sherman of Oakland, a
Mexican war veteran. He will bring with
him the famous little liberty bell made
from the metal donated by the women of
America to be used in the "attempt to re
pair the famous old Liberty bell at Phila
delphia. .â¢"
Dr. Crowley's Denial.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 16.â The attor
ney* for Dr. D. D. Crowley filed his an
swer and denial to-day to the charge of in
fidelity and cruelty made by his wife in
her complaint for a divorce. He claims
her charge is Que to an insane jealousy
and without cause. He also denies the
specific charges of cruelty and claims he
has at all times supplied his wife with
every comfort and provided for her wants
even extravagantly.
Will Change the Pipe.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 16.â The Contra
Costa Water Company has signified its
intention of abiding by the resolution of
the City Council adopted Monday night
and removing its water main from the
Eighth-street bridge. The pipe is thirty
inches in diameter and carries a force of
water under a pressure of seventy-five
pounds to the square inch. It is probable
the pipe will be taken to the Eleventh
street electric-road bridge.
Has Bad Enough.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 16.â The state
ment from Vailejo that ex-Congressman
Warren B. English was a candidate for
Congress is denied by that gentleman.
When seen to-day he said: "1 have no in
tention of running again for Congress. I
am not a candidate and will not be. So
far I have not heard of anybody who
wants to try for the office in this district,
whicn is hopelessly Republican; but we
will find somebody, of course, to fill the
ticket."

pleasure. Among them are Mr. and Mrs.
P. E. Bowles of the executive committee
of Fabiola Mayday fete, and they are
carefully looking out for features to intro
duce at the home show, which takes place
two weeks from to-morrow. Meetings are
being held every day and the various de
partments are hard at work, but President
Fitzgerald says that everything will be
ready as promised, and that there will be
no cause for disappointment.
The great number of entries for the
cycling events promises a remarkable
showing in that line. Tom Williams has
promised that the racetrack shall be pro

be rolled daily, so that there will be a fine
surface, provided that there are no heavy

committee have been assured that nothing
will prevent it opening at the trotting park

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 17, 1896.
TO HEAR KRUTTSCHNITT.
West Oakland Anxious About
the Future of the Rail
road Shops.
TUESDAY EAGERLY AWAITED.
The West Oakland Club Plans Many
Very Desirable Improve
ments.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 16. f
The immediate future of a large portion
of West Oakland depends upon a meeting
to be held next Tuesday night. The meet
ing is called by the West Oakland Im
provement Club and Manager Krutschnitt
of the Southern Pacific will be present,
and it is expected that he will tell of the
company's plans for that part of town.
The information that it is expected he Will
give is being eagerly awaited by hundreds
of property-owners.
For the past two years, commencing
just about the time of the strike, business
in that part of West Oakland nearest the
railroad yards has been at a standstill.
Officers of the West Oakland Improvement Club Who Are Anxious to Know What
the Railroad Is Planning for the Future.
No building has been done, hardly any
property has changed hands and the num
ber of vacant houses has increased. This
has been due in a measure to the fre
quently circulated reports that the South
ern Pacific intended to remove its shops
and take revenge on the district by with
drawing the particular class of workmen
who now support it.
Many of these rumors have been with
out foundation, but they have had a
marked effect for evil, and those interested
in that territory are anxious to know just
where they stand.
It was for the purpose of developing this
section of town that has boen so long neg
lected that the West Oakland Improvement
ment was recently formed. One of its first
acts was to invite Manager Krutschnitt
before them to ask about the intention of
the railroad. The invitation was accepted,
and next Tuesday's meeting will be one of
great interest. The objects of the organiza
tion are the extension of such measures
as may be for the welfare of those portions
of the city where the club members reside
and own property. Anions? the plans
outlined for immediate consideration is
the extension of Wood street to A street.
An effort will also be made to extend
Wood street to the Oakland Trotting Para,
and, with the aid of the West Berkeley
Improvement Club, which is working from
the other side, to obtain a snlendid drive
way from West Oakland to West Berkeley.
Steps will be taken toward securing the
rilling in of the marsh, so as to make it
available for manufacturing sites. The
club will also work for a park.
The officers of the club are George J. W.
Stark, president; J. C. Bullock, vice-presi
dent; C. L. Wines, secretary ; Louis Huf
schmidt, treasurer.
The meeting next Tuesday night will be
in Hansen's Hall.

CAUGHT IN THE BOOM.
A. T. Hatch, Fruit-Raiser, It Sold Out
by the Sheriff.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 16.â A. T. Hatch,
the well-known fruit-raiser, of Fruitvale,
entered into contract with Sherman, Clay
& Co., whereby he was to buy twenty and
one-third acres for $50,822 50, to be paid in
three equal installments in three, five and
seven years from July 25,1888, with inter
est from that date at 7 per cent on each
installment. He kept the interest up to
September 25, 1892, except $237146, and
gave a note for that sum.
The plaintiffs alleged in a complaint
filed August 3, 1895, that they stood at all
times ready to carry out their part of the
contract, but that when they demanded of
defendant that he pay the money he posi
tively and curtly refused to pay the said
purchase money and perform the condi
tions and obligations on his part; that he
had forfeited part of the contract of pur
chase and would have no more to do with
the matter. y y â â ...-â 
Hatch in his answers set up that the
price agreed upon was in excess of the true
value. At various times he paid $13,452 29,
and on July 25. 1893, he notified plaintiff
tbat he elected and did terminate the
agreement, which he claims was one of
the provisions of the deal, and asked that
the notes be canceled for the remainder.
The court found upon the trial that
plaintiffs were entitled to a judgment for
$57,139 95, principal and interest from Sep
tember 25, 1892, at 7 ncr cent and entered
an order of sale March 14, 1896.
The property was sold by the Sheriff to
day, and was hid in by plaintiffs for $20,000,
This leaves a deficiency against Hatch of
$47,139
Did Not Surprise the Judge.
The Green Bag says that Judge Gary has
a dry wit with him that is occasionally

pervaded ; by very audible tittering. : The
other day one' of the attorneys was airing
his indignation. He had been robbed*
yes, sir, robbed. It was shameful the way
things went right there under the eyes of
the law.
Finally Judge Gary noticed the fuming
and fretting one. "What's the matter
now?" he asked. "Matter? It's a con
founded outrage !â¢ Had my overcoat
stolen right from this room."* The Judge
smiled a little. "Overcoat, eh?" he said.
"Pah! that's: nothing. Whole * suits are
lost here every day."

THE REPUBLICAN ISSUE
An Address Issued by the Re
organizers' Committee on
Primaries. ."
WILL NOT BE DISFRANCHISED.
Declare That Principle, and Not Fer*
sonality, Has Created the New
Movement.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 16.â The work
of preparing for the primaries next Satur
day is being actively pushed. The com
mittee having the matter in hand issued
the following address to-day:
To the Republican Electors of Alameda County,
California: The undersigned, members of an
executive committee appointed by competent
authority, would respectfully present the fol
lowing for your consideration:
That the approaching Presidential election
is one of vital importance every thoughtful
citizen admits; that Repuolicahs are espe
cially interested in the issues at stake in said
election must also be admitted, and every
loyal member of that party, which has been so
conspicuous in shaping the beneficial legisla
tion of our Government for a third of a cen
tury, earnestly desires to do all in his power to
again place the party in complete control of
National affaire, to the end that our old-time
prosperity may be restored and our National
integrity sustained.
The call issued by the National Committee
contemplates active and earnest co-operation
by Republicans in all of the stages leading up
to the closing act in November, aud directs
that the selection of delegates to the State and
district conventions, which are to choose dele
gates to the National Convention, shall be by
: "the ordinary and usual methods." The Cali
fornia State Committee, however, departed in
a measure from this'instruction, and vested in
the Congressional committees the power to
select delegates to the State and district con
ventions by means of primaries or by direct
appointment.
The "ordinary and usual method" in this
State is to allow the people to themselves decide
by means of primaries who shall represent
them at their State, district and county con
ventions, and the Republicans of Alameda
County, jealous of their rights, emphatically
protest against the declared purpose of their
representatives on the Congressional commit
tee to arrogate to themselves the selection of
the delegates by appointment as being un-
American and in violation of the traditions
and fundamental principles of the party.
Being thus practically disfranchised by this
decision, the various Republican organiza
tions of the county look steps to assert their
rights in this regard by appointing three
members each to compose a committee of con
ference to devise methods to place the Repub
licans of this county in line with the provis
ions of the National call in the selection of
delegates, and the undersigned were, by this
committee of conference, appointed an execu
tive committee to do whatever was necessary
to accomplish that purpose. In carrying out
this object we sent three of our number to re
quest the chairman of the County Committee
to arrange for primaries, which request was
refused.
Then it became necessary to act Independ
ently or to yield our political rights, and, pur
suant to the authority vested in us, we ar
ranged for the holding of primaries Saturday,
April 18, 1896, under the auspices of the vari
ous party organizations, for the selection of
delegates to a county convention to be held
Monday, April 20, 1896, to cnoose delegates to
the State and district conventions to be held at
Sacramento May 5 next. To show that this move
ment is in line with the call of the National
Committee, and not in any true sense factional,
we would quote from the call: "Tne Repub
lican electors in the several States and'ierri
toties, and voters without regard to past polit
ical affiliations who believe in Republican
principles and indorse the Republican policy,
are cordially invited to unite under this call in
the formation of a National ticket."
In the Third Congressional District of Cali
fornia, contrary to this call, the electors have
not only not been invited by the local com
mittee, but their appeal to that call has been
disregarded. As the final object of the call is
the selection of a National not a State ticket,
we hold that the action of the State and dis
trict committee is without warrant, and that
in our appeal we are regular, consistent and
strictly ln touch with the spirit and traditions
of the Republican party, and In full accord
with the â  authoritative plan of the National
Committee. Let the charge of irregularity and
usurpation lie where it belongs.
It is important that a large vote should be
cast at the primaries Saturday, and we believe
that a proper understanding of the facts in the
case is all that is necessary to secure such a
vote. As the delegates to be voted for will be
nominated at the club meetings this week, the
committee would urge a full attendance, in
order that the selections may be generally sat
isfactory.
This committee expressly and emphatically
disavows that this movement is in tne interest
of any individual or combination, but state
that it was organized for the purpose of pre
serving the right of Republicans to have their
desires expressed in the selection of our Na
tional standard-bearers, and as a rebuke to the
few who tire seeking to arrogate to themselves
rights, privileges and duties which belong to
the rank and file of the party; which rights,
privileges and duties cannot be thus arrogantly
assumed by the few with safety to the interests
of our noble party or of our Nation. Respect
fully submitted,

The Turn of Napoleon's Fortune.
If there be a time when the turn of Na
poleon's fortunes is evident it.is the spring
of 1808. between * the determination to
complete his system of commercial offense
in Western Europe and the contempt
which he entertained for the Spanish
throne, he fell into a deadly snareâ that of
despising Spanish nationality. With the
first manifestation of national sentiment
in Spain began the process which ended
in his overthrow; Spam, Prussia and Aus
tria successively became aware that a dy
nasty is not a nation, that energy, high
principle and organizing power reside
after all in the people. This consciousness
once awakened the longing for unity grew
to be a passion with them as it had been
with France, their dynasties .became the
ministers of the popular will, the forces of
modern life were set free and the over
throw of Napoleonic imperialism became
only a matter of time. â "Life of Napo

Miss Sarah M. Severance, superintend

charge of the special suffrage edition of

field for several months in the interests of
the woman-suffrage campaign. At pres
ent she is in Tulare County.
Miss Severance's quaint, pithy style is
shown by the naive way in which she told
the story of her life to some friends re
cently. She said:
I was born in Cazenovia, N. V., and edu
cated in Oneida Conference Seminary at that
place. My life has been mostly spent as a
teacher, commencing at 16 and "boarding
round," a school that implanted the seeds of
woman suffrage, though they did not sprout
until later and the plant was unlabeled still
longer. In 1857 I graduated and immediately
went as preceptress to Ellington Academy,
Chautauqua County, N. Y. In 1862 I came to
California, teaching over five years in San Jose
Institute. In 1868 I removed to Gilroy, at
which place I had a private school for eighteen
yean, luting many pupils for college and for
teachers. As soon as my latent suffrage senti
ment blossomed and became recognized it im
mediately fruited. I felt that worK must fol
low conviction and endeavored to make up for
tardiness in commencing. As soon as the
National Woman's Christian Temperance
Union indorsed franchise 1 joined, our State
not having then adopted that department. I
am only ashamed that I did not help before.
In 1886 franchise was adopted by the Cali
fornia Woman's Christian Temperance Union
and I was made State superintendent. For
some time there was a division of sentiment,
but I have always believed that tolerance and
reason are our only weapons, and that it is bad
Christianity, as well as bad policy, to refuse to
opponents the fairness which we demand for
ourselves, so there has never been other than
friendly disagreement within our ranks, and
even that has now ceased. We are one, so far
as I know, in recognizing the power of the bal
lot and tho duty of woman to secure a choice
in her environment, a chance to use her tal
ents to promote what she knows is right. I
have come to feel that it is the first Christian
duty of women to secure the means to do their
duty; that he who can promote right and will
not is just as good as she who cannot because
of political bonds, and does not want the
chance.
ALAMEDA REPUBLICANS
The Regulars Meet to Select a

Primary.
Company G Troubles Not Overâ V. M. I.
Delegates to the Grand
Council.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 16, 1896.â The !
"regulars" say it is quite on the cards that
Taylor's nominees will be ratified by the
Oakland convention. They have no ob
jection to the gentleman nominated, but
are fighting for the principle of primaries
and against establishing a precedent
against them. Should the Oakland con
vention delegates not be seated at Sacra
mento there will be a "how dye-do," but
if the Sacramento Convention should agree
to support for President one who will be
acceptable to the "Regulars" and their con
freres all their minor quarrels will be los t
sight of, the broken chain mended and a
united Republican vote cast. On the other
hand if the Sacramento Presidential nomi
nee be a persona non grata they will bolt
the ticket.
The Regular Republican Club.
The Regular Republican Club of which
Colonel Babcock is the head, held an im
portant meeting this evening for the selec
tion of nineteen names to be placed on the
ticket for Saturday's primary. The
history why this club'"seceshed" from the
Alameda Republican Club is ascribed to
the fact of all the executive and precinct
oflicers being appointed en bloc by the
president and not by the members of the
club. After organization it was found
that the delegates for the State and Con
gressional conventions in Sacramento
were to be appointed. Then considerable
kicking all over the county ensued, and
the "Regulars" appointed a committee to
confer with others in Oakland, and
though E. A. yon Schmidt was in favor of

club primaries, the Oakland committee de
cided to have open primaries. Another
committee was appointed to wait upon
E. K. Taylor, of Alameda, chairman of tb*
Third Congressional District, and get him
to consent to nominate delegates elected
by the three Alameda Club primaries.
This he promised to do, if the Alameda
Republican Club would consent to prima
ries. In the interim the county commit
tee decided for open primaries, and as the -
Alameda club committee refused to bind
themselves without referring the matter
back to its club, and also whether the
club would be called together, the '"Regu
lars" lost patience, decided they would
not be played fast and loose with, with
drew their proposition and decided to fall
in with the Oakland method and have
open primaries. The result of the ballot
this evening places these names on the
ticket for Saturday: E. A. yon Schmidt,

Charges Against Chipman.
Only twenty men of Company Gr
answered to the roiicall to-night, the
thirty- members who preferred charges
of incompetency against Captain Chipman
being absent. Colonel Fairbanks and his
staff were in attendance. Captain Chip
man did not band in bis resignation, as
was stated would be done. If he had
known two years ago that he was not in
good standing with his men he would have
resigned, but now, after all he has done
for the company and its interests, he con
sidered it would be beneath his dignity to
resign. It was decided to send postal
cards to all members of the company for
next Thursday night, when the colonel
and his staff will again attend and try and
smooth matters over. At present a good
deal of feeling exists between the two
sections of the corps.
Divorce Granted.
Judgment in the divorce suit of Evan
Evans, 1719 Oak street, against his wife,
Rebecca Evans, has been entered in his
favor, the wife failing to answer the com
plaint. They had been married for twenty
years. He has been granted the 3ole cus
tody of the five children. The eldest, aged
19, is in Sacramento, one boy, aged 10, In
the lono Preston Reform School, while the
other three are at home. The mother is
said to have received a good sum of money
from her brother and is going to Salt
Lake City. But she is remaining in Ala
meda to try and obtain possession of the
youngest child.

Menace to American
Roads.
TAKING BUSINESS AWAY
What Is Lost to California by

SHIPMENT OF FRUIT INSTANCE
San Francisco Railroad Men Are
Watching the Fight in Con
gress on Bonding.
The movement started in Congress to
withdraw the bonding privilege now en
joyed by the Canadian Pacific on all
freight transported between points in the
United States by the Canadian Railway
has aroused considerable interest among
railroad men in San Francisco. Indeed it
has been the most important subject of
conversation since Senator Elkins made a
patriotic speech in the Senate about ten
days ago.
The Canadian Pacific Railway is so sit
uated that it holds the whip hand on
transcontinental freight business and can
carry freight almost for nothing in com
petition with the United States lines.
This is obvious in view of the guarantees
and subsidies from the Dominion Govern
ment. The Canadian Pacini is an im
perial highway, a military road, so lib
erally provided for that the American
roads cannot compete with it should a rate
war be started. At the present time,
though a peaceiul condition apparently
exists between the Canadian road and the
United States transcontinental routes, yet
by the system by courtesy known as "dif
ferentials" the former line dictates rates
to the latter, and the result is that the
United States lines have to accede a differ
ential of aoout 10 per cent in favor of their
northern opponent. if y C
The direct effect of this upon the pros
perity of California is held to be very seri
ous. At least an enforced and conse
quently false condition confronts the
State, ' more particularly the gateways
of Pacific commerce. San Francisco being
the main gateway and the . center of Pa
cific Coast commerce is a bad loser in the
game played t by the Canadians. Probably
no more forcible illustration of the un
equal struggle can be given than this one
cited yesterday by a local railroad man:
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
steamer Walla Walla sailed for Victoria
and the Puget Sound a few days ago. She
had on board over 100,000 pounds of dried
fruit from San Jose consigned to St. Paul,
Minn., via the Canadian Pacific Railway.
This freignt has to be transferred to the
Canadian Pacilic Navigation Company's
steamer at Victoria for transportation to
Vancouver, the Pacific Coast terminus of
the Dominion railway. At Vancouver a
third handling is necessary to place the
fruit on the cars, and then the circuitous
route is resumed to carry the freight
through Canadian territory and subse
quently into St. Paul. This one consign
ment represents the carrying capacity of
five railroad cars, and anybody who has
even a slight knowledge of railroading can
appreciate what money and labor are
necessary to move five cars half way across
the country. All the income, with its con
sequent exchange of wealth that should
accrue from this shipment, is lost to the
United States. And as for California a
large share of the wealth-producing ele
ment of this particular merchandise is
lost; it was cut off, diverted to a foreign
nation when the freight went through the
Golden Gate.
The Canadian Pacific was able to carry
this freight and pay the expense of
handling it twice and to take it nearly
double the direct distance of St. Paul from
San Francisco at, a profit. And yet the
rate, under the "differential" system, was
at least 10 per cent lower than the stand
ard transcontinental tariff as arranged by
the freight association.
Local railway officials are loth to discuss
the Canadian Pacific publicly, because
they do not wish to disturb "friendly re
lations" now existing. One of them, how
ever, explained the situation quite fully.
"The moment freight for Eastern cities
is put into a steamer at the wharf here to
be sent by tne Canadian Pacific it gives no
further wealth to the State," said he.
"Shipping goods by that route represents
aD expenditure for carting to the dock and
stowing on the steamer.
"Now, let us see what would be the effect
if the same freight went by the United
States roads. Mind you, lam not speak
ing for any one of these routes, for this
affects the Southern Pacific, Central Pa
cific, Great Northern and the Northern
Pacific out of San Francisco. Every mile
of road this freight would pass over in
California has to be kept in order at con
siderable expense. Every mile contributes
toward the wealth of the State. Taxes
have to be paid. And then the more busi
ness, of course, the larger will be the num
ber of men employed, all of which means
the circulation of money. ' This keeps
things going and is good for all classes of
people, but take the source of revenue
away, as in the case of the Canadian Paci
fic encroachment, and the State must
suffer, aad the people also.
"The Canadian Pacific shows that its
route is circuitous and rather objectionable
for transportation of American freights; it
passes through various climates and there
is delay in the roundabout route. Com
pared with the American transcontinental
routes this is a plausible showing, and
when a differential rate is proposed by the
Canadian line as just and fair the Trans
continental Association has to allow the
rate. In other words, the Canadian line
demands a certain differential, and always

gets it, having power to do as it pleases
without fear of interstate difficulties.
Then it is so liberally supported by the
Canadian Government it can carry freight
even lower than the present ruinous rates,
which don't give a living for anybody.
"This railway is rapidly absorbing the
carrying business between Eastern and
Pacific Coast cities of the United Stales,
and the American roads can do nothing
against it. Our lines may be classed as
private enterprises. The Canadian is vir
tually a Government railroad. So the
inequality of the roads is apparent.
"Everything that would tend to bring
business to the line is taken advantage of.
The Pacific Ocean presents a vast field of
possibilities, and the Canadian company
is fighting for business in the Orient, in
Australia, New Zealand and Honolulu. In
1895 its tonnage of tea, from the Orient
amounted to 14,000,000 poundsâ per
cent of the total importation of tea
through the Pacific Coast gateways.
Then it is getting a larger share of the
freight out to the Orient. Its interests are
so closely associated with American in
terests on the Great Lakes the company is
able to find powerful influence in Wash
ington." . *,
The Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company, the Great Northern, the North
ern Pacific and the Southern Pacific lines
are all deeply interested in the question
introduced by Senator Elkins in Congress
looking toward the revocation of the bond
ing privilege now enjoyed by the Canadian
Pacific.
Senator Elkins in a recent speech in the
enate said:
The Canadian Pacific Railroad is the natural
enemy of the transportation interests of the
United States, and it stands to-day as our

: greatest commercial antagonist. It violates
; our interstate commerce law with complacent
indifference; it cuts rates and it takes freights
'â â  from our Pacific railroads, in which the United
; States has a direct interest. It hauls more
! cheaply from St. Louis and other interior
points in our country, by way of Canada to
Oregon and San Francisco, than the Pacific
roads can do, though the distance is much
i shorter. It is a sharp competitor now for busi
ness with all the Pacific roads from and to Cal
| ifornia. For 2000 miles the Canadian Pacific
i traverses a non-productive country, one not
| able to support a railroad. It lives off its sub-
I ventions and the business it takes from the
| railroads of the United States.
All we have to do is simply to discontinue
! the bonding privilege, under which they carry
i goods in bond, starting from Vancouver to
: Europe and points in the United States. I
j would suggest that we stop every car and
break every consular seal at our frontiers be
yond Chicago and the"Soo." This would throw
i the trade from Asia to San Francisco and pass
! it over the Pacific railroad lines. It would
break up, in part or largely, the violation of
! the interstate commerce law and stop the giv-
I ing of rebates and the cutting of rates.
The Dominion Government has granted the
! Canadian Pacific Railway a subsidy or bonus
; of $25,000,000; has donated to it 25.000,000
i acres of land, embracing only such as are suit
i able for settlement; has also given right of
| wav, station grounds, dock privileges â¢ and
I water frontage, in so far as within the control
iof the Government; an i, further, has con
i structed and transferred to the Canadian Pa
! cific Railway Company, free of cost, 714 miles
j of railway, the estimated value of which, ac
cording to that railway company's report for
the year 1887. is $35,000,000. The Canadian
Pacific was permitted to import steel rails free
of duty, also other materials used in the con
; struction of its road and telegraph line. -Under
j its charter the Canadian Pacific is freed for all
time from taxation by the Dominion Govern
i ment or by any Provincial Government estab
lished after date of its charter. Its land grant
in the Northwest Territory is free from , taxa
tion for twenty years, unless sold in the mean
time. In addition to all this the Canadian
Government has bound itself not to permit
during the term of twenty years the building
] of any line or lines that would parallel the
Canadian Pacific Railway.
It may be true that, theoretically, the Cana
dian Pacific Railway is subject to the inter
state commerce law on interstate traffic pass
ing to or from Canada. But it is obvious that,
while the United States roads are subject to all
the restraints the interstate commerce act im
poses, it is impossible for this Government to
hold the Canadian Pacific Railway to an
observance of the law, for the United States
can have no jurisdiction over the rates charged
on intermediate business picked up and laid
down, in Canada, which, together with the
relatively small amount intercnanged be
tween points in Canada and the United States,
amounts to 96 per cent of that company's
entire earnings, according to a published
letter from the president of that company.
Tne Canadian Pacific Railway can thus make
rates on through business without interfering
with its earnings on traffic between Vancouver
on the west and Canadian frontier points on
the east, or between points Intermediate
thereto. Even on business, for example, from
San Francisco to Canadian points, formerly
wholly enjoyed by the American roads, there
are no means of knowing whether the Cana
dian Pacific Railway Company obeys the law
or not in this regard, for that . company might
take freight to Winnipeg at a higher rate tnan
for the same class of traffic through Winnipeg
to Chicago; but the consignee in Canada, even
if he knew American law, would bo : ; very un
likely to seek or receive redress from a United
States court or commission as against a' Cana-
I dian road. â¢â â¢â  .

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 17, 1896.
BRICKS BURY TWO MEN
Part of a Wall in the Old Sugar
Refinery Falls Upon
Them.
PHILIP SMITH WILL ' DIE.
" Look Out Came From the Fourth
Story and Then a Cloud of
Dust Hid the Scene.
A portion of a brick wall fell upon two
workmen at the old California Sugar Re
finery at Harrison and Eighth streets yes
terday evening, and one of the injured
men is expected to die at any moment.
A large force of men has been engaged
on the building tearing it down. On the
south wall just above the fourth story
some of them were loosening the bricks
with pickaxes. One fellow proved too
vigorous, for he moved a section of wall
several feet square, and before he knew it
it toppled over. It so happened that Philip
Smith of 17 Kate street and John Lennon
of Sixth and Tehama streets were imme
diately below cleaning brick. .
"Lookout! Ho! Save your "
The voice from above was drowned in a
great crash and then a cloud of dust mer
cifully covered the spot where the two
poor fellows lay crushed under the awful
weight.
From every side rushed men shouting
and excited beyond measure. The cloud
of dust was gone and they were instantly
upon the scene, tearing away the fallen
mass to rescue their unfortunate com
rades. In a few minutes Smith and'Len
nan were extricated from the debris and
removed to the Receiving Hospital in the
police patrol-wagons. j
Lennan's only apparent injury was a
contusion of the right leg, but he seemed
to be suffering from the shock to his sys
tem, as he is an old roan. 'â ;,-:-
Smith was supposed to be fatally in
jured. Six of his ribs were fractured, his
chest was crushed in, his right arm broken
and his left shoulder dislocated. He was
also injured internally. Dr. Thompson
expressed the opinion that Smith could
not live many hours. ' His wife was soon
at his bedside and tenderly nursed him.
"He has been a hard-working man all
his life," she said, "and it is hard to lose
him now when times are so dull. He had
been out of work for some time and we
were thankful when he got the job on
Monday* to clean the bricks at the old
sugar refinery. He is about 56 years of
age. Our children are all grown up. Two
of them are living with us, but the others
are married."
Smith was not able to give any account
of the accident, but Lennan said: "We
were cleaning, the bricks below when the
accident happened. They were tearing
down the south' wall, and I heard some
one call to those above to look out for the
men cleaning the bricks, and I heard them
shout back that they would. A moment
later there was a crashing noise, and I was
struck by falling bricks and stunned.
; "I am sorry for my wife, j When I left
her to go to work this morning there was
only, a nickel in the house, and I don't
know what she will do now tbat lam laid
up."
The old building was the Golden Sugar
Refinery in earlier days, and was closed
for nearly twenty years. It belongs to
the Luning estate, and is being torn down
by S. C. Buzzell for J. Noonan, whose
store on Mission street was burned down
recently. -'yy
The bricks are to â  be used in the con
struction of a building for Noonan, and
while cleaning them Smith and Lennan
were injured.

DYING FROM POISON.
Two Causes That Led Pretty Allie
Pomber to Swallow a Dose of
Carbolic Acid.
Allie Pomber, a pretty girl about 19 years
of age, is dying at the Receiving Hospital
from carbolic-acid poisoning. v
Several months ago she came to the City
from Castroville,." Monterey County, and
procured a position, as. waitress in the res
taurant 206 McAllister street. She worked
there till Wednesday afternoon, when she
was discharged. ; ." \ â¢
She had been living with Mrs. Hoy, at
195 Hyde street, and late yesterday after
noon she swallowed a dose of carbolic acid.
Shrieking with pain, she rushed out of her
room into the hallway and told one of the
male roomers what* she had done. He
asked her what had, caused her to do it,
and she said she had gone to a doctor and
he had told her she was in a dplicate con
dition. This, coupled with the loss of her
position, made her resolve to end her life.
The patrol wagon was summoned and
she was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where everything was done by Dr. Fitz
gibbon to save her life. The doctor, how
ever, said that she could not recover.
SOCIETY BASEBALL.
A Game on the Diamond for the Bier-

The ladies of the Mercantile Library
Auxiliary have arranged for an interesting
event to take place on the 25th of this
month. It will be a game of baseball be
tween a nine from the University Club
and a team from the University of Califor
nia. The latter team has not yet been en
tirely selected, but the University Club
men who will compete on the diamond for
the good cause and the victory are Thomas
Magee Jr., Will Magee, Arthur Allen
George Greenwood, Joe Tobin, Lawrie
lobin, Fred Howard, Everett Bee Ed
Ayer, Barry Knowles and Milton Latham.
Vanderlyn Stone will be the manager for
the event, which is sure to attract a great
a great society audience. The scene ofthe
contest will be Central Park.
The Building Trade*.
The Building Trades Council met last even
ing and listened to the reports of the business
agents. Several jobs around town were stated
to â¢ have been mixed, but by the efforts of the
agents were unionized. There are still a num
ber to be looked after where the non-union
men declined to affiliate with the unions of
their calling. From the general tone of the
statements it is safe to say that the working
card issued by the council is finding less oppo
sition since it is better understood by the con
tractors and the general public. The election
of R. T. Mclvor and C. F. Schadt as walking
delegates for the ensuing term was indorsed

Every effort made by the police to find the
bicyclists who were riding tandem on Sunday
afternoon and knocked down Mrs. A. Murphy
of 1424 Page street, in front of The
Call office, 710 Market street, has been un
successful. It is known that they belonged to
the Imperial Cycling | Club on Golden Gate

any persons who witnessed the accident. Mrs
Murphy was internally injured and four of her
teeth were knocked out. â â <

BRESSE'S LIFE IN DANGER
Stricken Suddenly Afters Supper
With Congestion, of
the Brain.
NOW A TRIP TO ENSENADA.
Dangerous Illness of One of the Lega
tees and Executors of a James
G. Fair Will.
Louis Bresse, one of the executors of,
and a legatee, to the extent of $10,000, in
the original James G. Fair will, must soon
be removed to Ensenada for complete re
pose. 'The young man who for many
years was private secretary for Mr. Fair
has so overworked himsel f during the past
few months, since the death of his em
ployer and friend, that he has been at last
stricken with congestion of the brain. He
has | been so ill that for a time Drs. Tait
and Luke Robinson almost despaired of
saving his life.
He was stricken suddenly a week ago
Sunday. As usual, on that day he and
his wife dined at the home of General An
drade, his father-in-law. They were ac
companied by Dr. Tait, a family friend
and physician, who, later on, went with
them to their own home, when he decided
to occupy a room which had been set apart
for him ever since j the young couple went
into their new house.
To this fact, and that the doctor had his
satchel of instruments with him, it is
probably due that Louis Bresse is still
alive.
The trio had a light late supper, after
which the doctor, feeling tired, retired to
bis room. He had hardly disrobed before
the screams of Mrs. Bresse brought him to
the side of her husband, wno on rising
from the table had fallen to the carpet un
conscious. '.*.Â«â  > y
Dr. Tait secured his lancet and bled the
young man, whose life was saved by the
operation. But he remained unconscious
and in a raging fever for twenty-four
hours.
Dr. Luke Robinson and Dr. Tait re
mained by the bedside of the patient until
two days ago watching every phase of his
delerium, and eventually they pulled him
through. But they have declared he must
shake himself away from the intricacies of
the Fair will case and the management of
the business of the Fair estate. Hence the
proposed trip to Ensenuda, on which he
will be accompanied by Dr. Tait.
ITS PARENTS ARE MURDERESS
Detnctivcs Searching for the Unnatural
Mother of the Abandoned Babe.
The death of the infant from exposure
which was found in a vacant lot at Mar
ket and Twelfth streets, makes the case
one of murder, and Captain Lees has de
tailed several of the best men in the de
partment to make an investigation and if
possible bring the guilty parents to jus
tice.
All the men working on the case are ob
serving the utmost reticence, and owing to
this fact it would appear that the detec
tives are working on a blind trail. It is
known, however, that some faint clews
have been obtained and it is to be hoped
that the whole wretched story may come
to light.
The most important clew in the hands
of the detectives is the mark of a Chinese
laundry on the towel in which the baby
was wrapped before being placed in the
satchel. The detectives decline to state
whether or not they have found the laun
dry, but it is fair to infer that they have.
After having found the laundry it would
be a comparatively simple matter to find
the owner of the towel and the unnatural
mother of the murdered baby.
Another clew which may" assist the de
detectives in tueir search is a large birth
mark on the left hip of the babe. They
will endeavor to find a physician who. has
attended the birth of a similarly marked
baby, and naturally he would be able to
inform the detectives as to the parents' iden
tity. At the instance of Captain Lees an
autopsy was held on the infant's body by
Dr., J. S. Barrett last evening. It "was

It assimilates with the food, increases the
flesh and appetite, builds up the nervous
system, restores energy to mind and body,
creates new, rich and "pure blood; in fact,
rejuvenates the whole system. Flesh,

no equals. The results following its use are
its best recommendations. Be sure, as you
value your health, and get the genuine.
