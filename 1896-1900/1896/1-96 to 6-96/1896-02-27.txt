' Slaughter of Peaceful Citizens by a Span
ish Force.
HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 26. â Refugees
from the towns of Punta Brava and Gua
tan, twelve miles away, have arrived at
Havana, and state that a rergn of terror
exists in their locality in consequence of
troops having massacred peaceful citizens
at Guatan on Saturday, the 22d.
The official Government report issued on
Sunday stated that a fight occurred near
Punta Brava on the previous day between
the troops sent from Mariano and the in
surgent bands of Villa Neuva and Acosta,
resulting in a glorious victory for the
Spanish arms, twenty insurgents having
been killed and fifteen prisoners taken.
Residents at Guatan have identified
eighteen of trie dead as pacificos (peaceful
citizens). Two were insurgents, and the
' prisoners are nearly all said to be peaceful.
One of them, named Ladislo Quintero,
claims American citizenship. He ;Is
â¢wounded by a ball in the arm.
. The following names of dead Pacificos
have been obtained: Jose Centera, Pedro
Aindor, Pascal Cnavez, Vidal Perdito,
Francisco Loza, H. Quisano, M. Hernan
dez, Ascance Garcia, Francisco Sales and
Pancho Chico. It is impossible to obtain
the names of the others owing to the
fright of the inhabitants.
A thorough investigation by American
correspondents, despite the fact that one
of their number had been arrested and
lodged in Morro Castle accused of visiting
Guatan, has resulted in obtaining the fol
lowing facts:
On the morning of the 22d a band not
exceeding forty insurgents, under Villa
nueva and Acosta, were attacked on the
highway by troops under Lieutenant Zieu
â¢ti and civil guards under Alcalde at
Hoyo Colorado, a town two miles west of
Punta Brava. The tight occurred at the
western entrance of Punta Brava, twelve
miles from Havana. It resulted. in the
wounding of one Spanish soldier, who was
shot in the head and died a half hour later.
The insurgents withdrew and the troops
entered Punta Brava arid remained two
hours, sending mounted , messengers to
Mariano, live miles east, asking that troops
be sent to Punta Brava. Lieutenant Zieu
jjesti then moved his detachment back to
Hoyo Colorado.
The Marquis de Cervera Alcalde of
Mariano, in command of troops there, sent
300 men including the Battalion Publico,
volunteers, firemen and a section of horse
artillery, all under command of Captain
Galvo.
The troops found a group of about

The towns of Guatao and Punta Brava
are now deserted. The residents fled to
Havana in fear of their lives. Of 1710 peo
ple in the latter town only fourteen re

Havana has created an intense sensation
here. The only official notice taken by
the Government is a telegram of congratu
lation sent Marquis de Cervera Sunday.

TRIAL. Of FIZ.IBVSTERS.
Taking of t.ridence Against the Horsa's
Officers Concluded.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Feb. 26.â The
trials of the late officers of the steamer
Horsa, Captain J. H. Wiborg, First Mate
Jans P. Petersen and Second Mate H.
Johansen, on the charge of engaging in a
Cuban filibustering expedition, which is
said to have started from Brooklyn, N. V.,
in Novembar last, was resumed in the
United States District Court to-day.
Several members of the crew and others
who admitted they were being paid by
either the Spanish Consul or the Pinker
ton agency gave testimony similar to that
brought out at the preliminary ex
amination. The prosecution rested its case
and the defense opened.
At the afternoon session Captain Wibore
took the stand on behalf of hi'nself and
the other defendants. This closed the
testimony for both sides.
Counselor Keer presented thirteen
points which he desired the court to rule
upon in the charge to the Judge, and this
led Judge Butler to express himself re
garding the construction of the statute
under which the accused were indicted.
The Judge declared that he would not rule
upon the aspects of tne statute that were
unnecessary in the trial of the case. The
only points at issue, he declared, were:
Was this a military expedition? And.
if so, did the defendants aid it?
The Judge firmly expressed his con
viction that the combining of any
body of men for the purpose of engaging
in war constitutes a "military expedition"
within the meaning of the law, no matter
what name they may assume. In making
this ruling Judge Butler admitted that it
disagreed with the charge of the Judge in
a recpnt similar trial at Charleston, H. C,
when Captain Hughes of the Bteamer
Laurada was acquitted.
Judge Butler asked Counselor Keer to
state his views regarding the statute and
what constitutes a military expedition, and
Mr. Kter will do so to-morrow. Assistant
District Attorney Ralston began the open
ing address to the jury, and 3:45 o'clock,
before he had concluded, the court ad
journed until to-morrow.

NEW YORK, N. YJ Feb. 27.â The
Herald's special cable from Panama says:
A formidable revolution has broken out in
Nicaragua against the Government of
President Zelaya. So far as can be learned
the present leaders are General Ruben
Alonzo, ex- Minister of War; Jose M.
Chavarria, Military Governor of Leon;
Francesco Baca, ex-Minister of the In

It is reported that the revolution has
spread all over the western provinces, in
cluding Chinandega and Chichigalpa.
The port of Corinto has been closed and
Mr. Severich, the general agent of the
Pacific Mail Company, has been notified to
that effect. Steamers will not be allowed
to touch at that port.
The port of San Juan del Sur is still
open. More than 500 tons of cargo for
Corinto are now awaiting shipment here.
A private dispatch from Nicaragua re
ports that hard fighting has taken place
between the rebels and the Government
forces near Momotombo on Lake Mana

Telegraphic communication is inter
rupted at points between Corinto and
Leon with Managua, the capital.
The Pacific Mail steamer Barracouta is
unloading freight here which was des

Corinto is already in the possession of the
revolutionist?.

The Measure Comes Up as a Special

FRANKFORT, Kt., Feb. 26.-Senator
Thomas Hays, the leader of the Hunting
ton forces, attempted to bring up the bill
for the repeal of the charter of the South
ern Pacih'e Railroad before the Senate this
evening. This had, to be done without ob
jection. Senator Fulton was on his feet at
the instant of Hays' motion and vigor
ously entered his protest. Senator Hay
ward followed suit in the' hope of getting
under consideration another measure.
Senator Goebel, the champion of the re
peal bill, quietly indorsed the action of
Fulton and Hayward, and said he did not
want the measure considered in piecemeal,
and that the measure had been set for to
morrow evening, when it would be dis
posed of by the Senate. The friends of the
bill did not care to break into arrange
ments already made. I ;\

Senator Goebel said to a Call correspond
ent to-night:
"The bill will come up as the special or
der for to-morrow evening. I believe a
vote will be reached and the measure
: passed in that session."
Senator Rozel Weissinger will champion
the Huntington forces to-morrow and will
speak against the passage of the bill. Sen
ator Goebel will be assisted by Senator
I Taylor, Sims and others. Senator Sims
said to-night:
"There will be a tremendous n>ht put
up against the bill, but I think the only
way to defeat the measure is by delay. It
should, and I think will, pass the Senate
to-morrow."
Senator Hissom, a prominent Republi
can in the Senate, said: "The bill will
likefy receive the support of a great part of
the Republican members, and I thiuk it
will pass."
There has been no meeting of the House
Committee to consider the duplicate of the
Goebel bill in that branch, and will not be
until tte measure is disposed of in the
Senate.
Yesterday the mountain labored and
brought forth a mouse. Senator Weissin
ger closed Ins great forensic effort in be
half of^the monopoly, with the only visible
effort of sending part of his audience out
to get aâ well, breath of fresh air, if you
likeâ and others who had comfortaDle
seats into very deep meditation, so pro
found in some instances that it became
sonorous, and in such regular cadence
that it gave him a sort of pitch by which
to regulate the inflexions of his unmusical
voice. Whether the Senator construed
this to mean a sweet concurrence with his
views or not is hard to say; but it is cer
tain that while he gave better observance
to the meter, he sang his song through the
full limit of his time, and seemed to think
he had done protty well, too. In one
sense he had. His power as a lull lobby
ist is no longer open to dispute.
On the whole the general effect of the
"mutual admiration society" member
from the "Pandanna" Club seems to have
been in favor of the bill, and its friends
are rejoicing in the fact that it was lie, ana
not the brilliant Bronston, who was se
lected to picture the legal effect of passing
this "appalling" measure. They continue
to hope that Bronston will take no further
part against the bill than to vote.
Weissinger's whole course thus far in
session has tended to antagonize a major
ity of the members. His persistent obsti
nacy in trying with two others to dictate
to the great majority of his party on the
question of supporting the nominee for
United States Senator, thus prolonging
the tight and defeating the wish of his
party; his captious and chronic objections
to almost anything or everything: that
any other member proposed, have tended
to win him few enthusiastic admirers.
Then, too. some of the members from
the mountain counties "don't like a fellow
that wears a plug hat and a high collar
and shaves every day." Yet Rozel Weis
singer is no "dude" by any means. He is
too exclusive, however, for "hoi polloi"(t.he
people generally), and especially for cer
tain members who never saw the inside of
atailor-shop, but always wear store clothes
on state occasions. Such is human nature,
and to such prejudices ambition must
bend the knee or fail. Weissinger has
been too proud to bow down, and the cause
he advocates is the loser.
The question is not how many votes did
he gain for his side by his speech, but how
many against it. The Senator showed a
lack of experience and judgment yesteV
day afternoon when he tried to kill off
Senator McChord, "who was to follow.
When he rose to begin he remarked that
it lacked but a quarter of an hour of the
usual time to adjourn, and moved to ex
tend the time and dispose of the bill be
fore adjournment. This would have shut
off Goebel's closing, which they all feared,
and limited McChord and any others who
might have desired to speak for the bill.
Of course there was prompt objection
and he had to consume the time himself.
His attempt had the effect of making
Senator McChord more determined than
before in his advocacy of the bill and he
is spending a good part of the time of the
recess in preparing a broadside in answer
to the line of argument that Senator Weis
singer's remark indicated he would follow,
and the Humingtonites are now "sorry
they did it."
Senator McOhord's effort will fully an
swer the expectations of his friends. It
will be a powerful and piercing arraign
ment of conscienceless monopoly and a
strong rebuke to the inconsiderate legis
lation which bred and fosteied to such dan
gerous growth the Southern Pacitic mon
ster. He has a powerful appeal to the
Senate, to heed the cries of the oppressed
people of the Pacific Coast, and withdraw
its countenance from the man and God
defying robbers and oppressors who, acting
under the law of Kentucky, ignore and
trample under foot the laws of California.
He will be listened to with much attention
by a full chamber and a crowded lobby, as
he is a popular speaker.
He is thoroughly prepared to answer
Mr. Weissinger, and in a master way dis
pose of his arguments as the deleterious
effects of the repeal on the confidence of
the people in the stability of chartered
institutions in general and railroads in
particular. He will show Mr. Welssincer
and the Legislature very conclusively that
the passage of the bill will hurt but few
people, and they are fully able to stand it,
while it will benefit nearly 2,000,000 who
were in almost absolute slavery as long as
the charter existed.
Mr. McChord is in fine trim, and when
he warms tip to his work, which he will do
in a few moments after opening, he will
win every one in the House not already
pre-e m i>tecl with hi m . His long- senrie* ill
his native county's contests with the
L. and N". Railroad over a bond liability
and his four years' service as Railroad
Commissioner under Governor Brown
have made him thoroughly acquainted
with corporation law and the workings of
tariff schedules. He will soon make
Senator Hays sorry that he ever alluded to
the subject of corpdration rates in Cali
fornia and the East.
The Springfield Senator has all these
things well sorted in his mind and he will I
not need to read them from print except
to show his authority for a citation of
fact. Major Hays will not bo able to keep
up with him even with his "primer" in
his hand, but the Senate will, and catch
ing the inspiration of the speaker follow
his array of facts and comparisons and his
logical conclusions therefrom till they are
led to the point of conviction almost be
yond escape. His speech alone will more
than match the arguments of both Hays
and Weissinger.
He will make but little allusion even to
the latter's criticism of Judge Seymour C.
Thompson's article in the American Law
Review, read to the Senate by Senator
Goebel yesterday, not seeming to think
that the Senator's attack needed any at
tention. It was too much like Sancho
Pan/.a charging the windmill. It may be
that Mr. McChord does not exactly see what
there is to answer, as it is a question in the
minds of some of the audience as to
whether Weissinger himself knew just
| what he was trying to say.
There are some few people, who still
think the Pandanna member a great law
yer even if he does make people "tired."
He may be a good iawyer without being a
good advocate, especially in a case like
this, where his own true and better nature
won't let his heart enter into the case in
which mistaken loyalty to interested
friends has led him and his natural obsti
nacy keep? him.
Senator Jack Gross was an attentive
listener to all the proceedings, and if he
was incliued to waver before, Rozel's
speech fixed him for the bill; and while
he will not probably make any extended
remarks on the subject during the debate,
he will talk outsideâ and "Jack" is a man
of few words and much influence among
his fellow-members, especially the country
boys, who admire him. He don't like to
wear a cravat, and as for a high collar like
Rozel's, he would as soon think of hang
ing himself.
He ridiculed Mr. Weissinger's burst of
indignation at the attempt of California to
secure a repeal of the Kentucky charter,
while the Mr. Huntington was engaged in
Washington before Congress, and his
characterization of it as "firing in Mr.
Huntington's rear." Jack was all through
the war, and was fighting like a man,
while Rozel was playing "mumbly-peg"
and tops, and he informed him that in a
real fight the custom wa3 to hit t-ne enemy
wherever you could, if in the rear so much
the better.
Senator Gross is a crude, rough dia
mond, but true as steel to his convictions
and his party, and very plain spoken.
When Cleveland was first elected '"Jack"
called on him, and being received in
a quiet moment entered into a chat with
the Wonder of the Age, during the course
of which, to emphasize some remark he
was making, he brought his mighty palm
down on the President's knee with some
force. Cleveland was startled, jumped,
and, impressed with the idea thai Captain
Gross was a man of much force, if not
many words, appointed him Marshal for
Kentucky.
The speeches yesterday and the after
talk have practically settled the fate of the

WICHITA FALLS, Tex., Feb. 26.â The
two men who murdered Cashier Dorsey of
the City National Bank here yesterday and
then looted the bank were captured this
morning. To-night they were taken from
the jail by a mob and lynched to a tele
graph pole.
The robbers, Foster Crawford and the
Kid, alias Younger Lewis, were captured
by posses of rangers under command of
Captain W.J.. McDonald in a thicket six
teen miles from "Wichita Falls. When
called upon to surrender they replied :
"We will surrender under "the condition
that you give us protection against any
mob violence." T<'iV.:i
Captain .McDonald's reply was: "Wo
will bore a hole through you if you do not
; surrender, but I will endeavor to the best
of my ability to protect you."
The outlaws surrendered, and the rangers
reached Wichita Falls with the prisoners
at 4 o'clock this morning. When the town
was reached it was found to be in a state
of uproar, and many threats - were made,
the: mob crying: "We will lynch them!
Give them a taste of Tyler; "that's what
t i ey deserve!" But they finally reached
j the jail and landed their prisoners in
safety.
Shortly afterward a crowd of well-armed
men gathered and repaired to : the jail,
where they remained discussing the situa

At 8:30 J. A. . Kemp, president of

I was instantaneous and undeniable. Dis
trict Judge George E. Miller at this junc
ture appeared on the streets in a buggy
and dr,ove from group to group pleading

Suddenly the report was heard on all

the outlaws off to Fort Worth. In the
twinkling of an eye, hundreds of Winches
ters appeared on the scene and the mob at
once made an assault on the jail. After
some moments they succeeded in securing
an entrance, and taking the prisoners from
the jail, proceeded witn them to the bank
in which Dorsey was killed, where a pile of
inflammable material was ready to be con
verted into a bonfire to light up the scene.
Two telegraph poles were selected and
two ropes thrown over them, in the enda

were placed around the necks of the men

the two men were swinging beneath earth
and sky.
Loud cries of "Riddle them was the
signal for the firing to commence. The
bodies were riddled with bullets and left
swinging.

Carter of Montana Takes
Fellow-Republicans
to Task.
DEFENDS HIS COURSE.
Party Members Who Truckled
to Cleveland's Policy Styled
Magpies.
SHERMAN AND TELLER CLASH.
Conflict of Words Between Friends
of Silver and the "Sound
Money" Leaders.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 2aâ A nu
merous Senate and a large audience in the
llexies were highly entertained
to-day by ar. outbreak in the Republican
ranks, started by Carter of Montana, and
upheld by Teller of Colorado. It was Car
- first introduction to the Senate in
the role of an orator or leader, and hold
ing as he does the post of chairman of the
Republican National Committee, there
was much interest and importance at
tached to his words. He made an excel
lent impression at the start, speaking in
elo\v| time and iv soft, well-rounded tones
without any undue excitement or passion,
and he'kept it till the close, when his pe
roration was warmly applauded.
The speech was made in justification of
himself and the other Senators who had
voted against the House tariff bill. For
that vote be said he had ample justification
tad no apology. The tariff bill was not a
.Republican measure. It was a measure to
meet an alleged emergency, which, accord
ing to the President, did not exist at all.
it afforded no protection to the American
woo:-erower5, while it took good care of
the American wool manufacturers. As
Senator Morgan a few years ago held up to
ridicule the President's Democratic
cuckoos, so Carter ridiculed the Republi
cans who sustained the President's "sound
money" policy as magpies. He appealed
to the candid judgment of honest men as
to what Republican Senators were recreant
to their party â those who resisted the
obliteration of the last vestige of legisla
tion in favor of silver from the statute
j, or those who sustained President
Cleveland in that policy.
Carter complained that four members
of the Senate, including himself, had been
indicted by the leading journals of the
East and pronounced guilty of treason to
the Republican party without trial.
Against this judgment lie set up the fact
that the House tariff bill, which they had
helped to defeat, was at variance with all
past professions of the Republican party
on the tariff question.
"it is admitted, " he said, "that the
House bill is not and was not intended to
be an expression by the party of its views.
It has been and is now distinctly asserted
that it is not a Republican measure. It is
a measure to meet a:i alleged emergency
which the chief executive officer of the
Nation stoutly asserts does not exist at all.
''The party, then, is in the attitude of
forcing uncalled-for relief upon a reluctant
Democratic administration."
Aside irom this, Carter contended that
the method employed was seriously ob
jectionable. It ouiit upon existing law as
a foundation. The "Wilson tariff bill has
been everywhere condemned by Republi
cans as notoriously inequitable and un
just. It assumed lo protect the manufac
turers, and cast the producers of so-called
raw material throughout the country into
open competition with cheap labor every
where. The pending bill now proposed to
make this injustice more glaring.
Certain Republicans of mature judg
ment, wide research and unquestionable
integrity of purpose had urged the party
to undo by law toe mischief brought about
by law. This element in the party was
known as the free silver element. Re
cently certain self-constituted censors of
party action had been pleased to denomi
nate such Republicans as conspirators
against the public weal; otners had gone
so far as to invite them to relieve the party
of their obnoxious presence. They had
been advised that their States were not
needed in Republican columns.
"To the candid judgment of honest
men," said Carter, "I leave the determina
tion of questions relating to the fidelity of
Republicans in this Senate to their party
principles. The Republicans alleged to
have proven recreant to Republican prin
ciples resisted the effort to strike the last
silver-coinage law from the statute books.
They resisted the passage of the Wilson
bill; they resisted the issuance of bonds
in time of peace; they resisted the con
troction of the currency by the retirement
of the greenback, and they now resist an
inferential violation of the principles of
tbe Republican party platiorm by resist
ing the approval of horizontal tariff revi
sion, ad valorem duties and the Wilson
bill.
"On protection and bimetallism," he
continued, "as the basis of economic and
financial policy of the country the whole
"West is united. The party which accepts
the one aud ridicuies the other cannot ex
pect support from the people of that Bec
tion of the country."
Carter concluded as follows:
"The maintenance of the unity and in
tegrity of the Republican party is of over
shadowing importance to the country. In
the midst of the prevailing chaos of
theories on public questions, we owe it to
the i ast and to the future tc stand firmly
by oar proclaimed principles, wiinout
evasion, mental reservation or purpose
to deceive.
"The pending measure, born under the
passing excitement of the manufactured
war cloud, would do the country no good,
but it would do the party great injury by
making it share responsibility for the
gloom which, appeared and will depart
with this administration."
Carter's speech was followed by a dis
cussion of the money question, in which
Senators Sherman of Ohio and Teller of
Colorado were the combatants on either
Hds and in which hard blows were given
and received.
Teller said the silver men |"were to be
turned out of the Republican party be
cause they believed in maintaining all the
provisions of the platform and not a part
oi it."
Sherman replied to Teller. Sherman
defended his own position on the money
question. It was now felt and believed
that the bimetallism now established by
law was not only the fixed rule in the
United States, but was growing to be the
rule in all the silver States, in South
America and Mexico.
Teller said tuat the Minneapolis conven
tion would never have entertained such a
deiinition of bimetallism as the Senator
from Ohio. It would be laughed out.
The Senator could not put the Republican
party on that kind of bimetallism.
Everybody knew that the people could
not get along without subsidiary silver
coin. To define that as bimetallism was
playine on the American people what
might be called, in common parlance, a
"bunko game." Teller said he would read
an article on the question from the New
York Evening Post, "a paper which had
never said a kind word for silver."
"Nor anybody else," Hawley prompted.
"It is said to be owned by British cap
ital,'"! eller added, "and I understand that
is the truth of nearly all the great metro
politan dailies."
In the further course of his speech, de
livered in a very exciting manner, Teller
exclaimed that the only thing that would
bring prosperity and progress to the
country and would silence the discontent
of the people, which was shown by a Re
publican success one year, a Democratic
success the next year and a Populist suc
cess the third year, was honest, sound
money, made up of the two metals.
This parliamentary storm was suc
ceeded by a dead calm, in which the
Cuban belligerency resolution floated for
an hour or two without making any per
ceptible progress. Allen (Pop.) of Ne
braska offered a substitute for the pending
Cuban resolution. It authorizes and re
quests the President to issue a proclama
tion recognizing the independence of the
republic, of Cuba. He asked that the reso
lution lie on the table.
Allen referred to the vote yesterday on
taking up the tariff bill and the state
ments made by Morrill (R.) of Vermont
and others that the tariff bill was dead,
and stated that while he did not believe in
the policy set forth in that bill yet if the
Republicans couid unite upon it and would
couple with it an amendment providing
for the free coinage of silver â not a substi- j
tuteâ the I'opulist party in the Senate !
would help pass it. The Populists in the !
Senate now said to the protectionist Re
publicans, "We will swallow your measure
of taxation (the House tariff bill), which
fa nauseating, which is unjust, if you give j
to the people of the country more sound â 
money with which to pay the increased
taxation."
He said that the Populist votes, added
to the forty-four Republican votes in the
Senate, would carry the House tariff bill j
by a' majority of five, aud the Populist !
Senators would give their votes for it if {
the Republican Senators would vote for j
the addition to it of a free-coinage substi
tute. He introduced and sent to the
clerk's desk a bill in that form.
IN THE HOUSE.
Arguments in the Van Horn-Tarsney
Election Contest.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 26.- All
but the fir~t hour of a long day's session
in the House was devoted to the discussion
of the Van Horn-Tarsney contested elec
tion case from Missouri. It was announced
by Johnson, in charge, that a vote would
be taken to-morrow. Tarsney made the
opening speech in his own behalf, advo
cating the adoption of the recommenda
tion of the minority- or that the case be re
opened and the ballots in certain disputed
precincts in Kansas City recounted.
Messrs. Parker (R.) of New Jersey and
Powers (R.) of Vermont also supported
the minority report. Burton (R.)of Mis
souri advocated the majority report un
seating Tarsney (D. ), but the latter had
not ceased his remarks when the House,
at 5:30, adjourned.
Powers was interrogated by Johnson as
to whether or .not he had read the evi
dence in the case. Replying that he had
read some of it, Johnson asked, "How
much?"
"I have read enough to know that you
and the majority of the committee are all
astray in the way you are proceeding. You
have stopped just short of the facts in the
case." [Applause.]
He urged upon the Republicans of tho
House the necessity of avoiding: making a
precedent that should return to plague
them.
Senate amendments to the bill extend
ing the time in which the Government
may enter suit to annul land patents
issued under railroad, wagonroad and
canal grants, were concurred in by an aye
and noe voteâ lss to 93.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY -jt, 1596.
BOIES TO LEAD
THE SILVERITES
His Name May Head the
White Metal Party's
Ticket.
WOULD MAKE THE RUN.
â 
; Regarded by lowa Leaders as
the Logical Candidate of
the Bimetailists
! DECLINES DEMOCRATIC HONORS
The Ex-Governor Can Secure the Fourth
Party Nomination if He Will
Accept It.
DES MOINES, lowa, Feb. 26.â A con
ference of leading silver men of the State,
nearly all of them Democrats, was held
here this afternoon. It was secret, but
enough has been made public to create
something of a sensation. It develops
that the leaders of the silver Democrats
knew some time in advance that Governor
Boies was going to issue Ihe letter de
clining to be a candidate for tue Demo
cratic nomination for the Presidency, lie
consulted with some of them about it.
S. H. Bashor of Waterloo, one of the
silver leaders, a neighbor of Boies and one
with whom the latter has frequently con
ferred recently, said to-night that in view
oi the action taken to-day and of the let
ter by Boies, he believed there was a
strong prospect that the lowa silvorites
would, in case it became evident that both
the Republican and Demoratic National
parties were going to declare against
silver, join a National movement for a
silver ticket this year and name Boies as
their choice for the head of such ticket.
He said Boies' letter made him at once the
logical candidate of such a movement and
that he would certainly be the strongest
man who could be named on such a ticket.
He believed there would De no doubt
about Boies' nomination if he would have
it; and he was satisfied if the nomination
were offered him Boies would consider it a
duty to accept.
Amo3 Steckel of Bloomfield presided at
the meeting to-dey and C. J. Murphy of
Dubuque was secretary. The important
action was the issue of a call for a conven
tion of silver men here July 14. This is
eight days before the National Bimetallic
Convention at St. Louis, and the date is
set with the idea that if lowa so desires, it
can send a delegation to that convention.
ELK INS WAS MISQUOTED.
Hid Not Say That West Virginia Wottld
Support McKinley.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 26.â Senator
Elkins' attention being called to a re.
port from Cleveland dated the 21st inst.,
reporting that he was in that city and au
thorized the statement that the delegation
*rom West Virginia would support McKin
ltÂ»y at the St. Louis convention and that
he (Elkins) was for him, stated that he au
thorized no such statement and that he
had not declared his preference for the
Presidency to any one.
He also said that the statement that he
had said that West Virginia would be for
McKinley does the State an injustice, as
well as the delegates, who are yet to be j
chosen. He does not wish to be under
stood as trying to commit the State or
delegates to any particular candidate.
Senator Elkins further expresses the
opinion that Southern Republicans should
send delegates to St. Louis not pledged to
any candidate and that they should con
fer after reaching St. Louia and decide
upon the wisest and best course to be pur
sued in the interest of the South and act
as a unit upon some definite line of action.

ROENTGEN RAYS OUTDONE.
Horseshoe Magnet Utilized to
Photograph Through Hard
Substances.
Professor Pratt's Experiments With
a Simple Outfit Results in
Success. â¢
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 26.â Professor
H. P. Pratt of this city has duplicated
with the horseshoe magnet the more
elementary experiments the world ia
making with cathode rays. That is to
say, he is producing the shadows of iron
rings in boxes, coins in a leather purse
and that sort of thing.' It seems that the
simplicity of the apparatus needed would
popularize the photography. He con
ceives of a great magnet to photograph
the human body, with its fine diffusion of
lines of force briu: ing out all the varia
tions in flesh and bone upon the plate.
Lines of force from a magnet laiu on
a sensitive piate produce chemical de
composition. Objects placed betwfen the
magnet and the plate retard the rays
in proportion to their density. The nega
tive gives prints showing shadows of the
objects.
ihe other night Dr. Pratt, out of curi
osity, put a horseshoe magnet on top of a
sensitive plate. Beneath the ends of the
magnet he laid some pennies. The plate
was wrapped up in heavy black cloth.
Then Dr. Pratt turned out the lights and
went home. When he came back next
morniug and developed the negative the
results were too good to believe. As he
afterward said :
"Of course you understand that the
shadows of a photographic print are the
light parts on the negative. That par.t of
the plate where the magnet had rested was
white. The location of the pennies was
shown by light spots."
When tbe discovery shall have been
brought to perfection it is his belief that
it will show upon the sensitive plate the
delicate tissue of the human body. The
crude results he has obtained cause Dr.
Pratt to be more strongly contirmed in his
theory that the unknown rays are simply
lines of electricul force. Whether from a
Crookes tube, a static machine or a mag
net, he professes to believe the activity is
the same in all cases.
BREAKS ALL RECORDS.
Professor Rowland's Multiplex Printing Tel
egraph Can Transmit 18,000 Words
Over One Wire in an Hour.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 26.-A Tribune
Bpecial from Baltimore says: Professor
H. A. Rowland of Johns Hopkins Univor
slty, after nearly a year*3 labor, has been
successful in perfecting a remarkable in
vention for transmitting telecrama written
upon a typewriter at the place of sending
and reproduced in typewritten form at tbe
receiving point.
In addition to the typewriter part of the
invention, Professor Rowland, with bis
new machine, can send over the same wire
five or six different messages at the same
time in one direction, which, in duplex,
makes ten or twelve messages which can
be transmitted on the same wire at the
same time. Thus, with five operators at
each end of the line, 300 words a minute
can be transmitted.
Dr. Rowland is assured that no such in
vention has ever been patented. He has
used a synchronous device in his inven
tion, and in the mechanical arrangement
of tbe typewriter he has used but eight
signals, the letters being produced by
combinations. The current of electricity
transmitting the message can be relayed,
and in this manner the invention can be
operated for a great distance.
In finished form the instrument will be
as convenient, and as easily operated as
the ordinary telegraphic apparatus. Pro
feÃsor Rowland calls his invention the
"Multiplex Printing Telegraph."

the celebrated stallion, with a record of
2:05%, a son of Director (2:17), and at one
time the champion American pacer, was
sold this evening for $8250 to James Butler
of New York City, the president of the

TREE GETS THE VERDICT.
Decision Rendered' in the Garfield Park
Racetrack Cate.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 26.â After a long
and closely contested trial a jury in Judge
Burko's court this morning returned a
verdict awarding ex-Judge Lambert Tree,
former Minister to Belgium, $38,320 dam
ages aeainst Michael 0. McDonald, known
in gambling and turf circles of the coun
try as "Mike" McDonald.
The action grew out of the renting of
the Garfield Park Racetrack, owned by
Judge Tree, to the Garfield Park Club.
McDonald, it was claimed, guaranteed the
rent, and the point on which the defense
rested to win was that the ex-Miuister
knew that the law against gambling- was
being violated on his property and there
fore had no right to recover, having rented
the tracK for gambling purpose?. Judge

that a day's delay in the action on the

IN 188 Hor/yE COMMITTEE.
Hubbard Say* the. Profit* of the Pacific
' lioads Are EnArtnou*.
"WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 26.â Thomas
H. Hubbard, representing the Searles es
tate, concluded his statement before the
House Committee on Pacific Railroads to
day. He stated that the profits of the Pa
cific railroads were enormous. He could
not say what the roads had made, but he
did not think any man was living, with
one exception possibly, who could give the
information.
Speaking of the Canadian Pacific Rail
road, he said that it was decided to build
the road long after the American Pacific
roads were completed. When the Can
adian project was undertaken the difficul
ties were well known; yet the Dominion
Government had given the Canadian Pa
cific much more than we had given our
roads, and had asked no return.
He did not want to contrast the two
Governments, but he wanted the commit
tee to consider the difficulties experienced
in building our roads. Representative
Boatner asked if the building of our trans
continental roads had not forced the con
struction of the Canadian Pacific, but Mr.
Hubbard thought not.
Taking up the questions of dividends,
Mr. Hubbard said it was an every-day oc
currence to have railroad bonds default
after paying interest for years. In such
event did the stockholders say .that this
interest should not have been paid,
but should have been saved for
one "evil day." The Government pro
vided what the roads should reserve for
its benefit.
These requirements have been carried
out and there was not money enough on
hand now to meet the bonds and inter
est, because the Government requirements
had not been sufficient. The company had
to decide what should be done with its net
earnings year by year. It could not look
ahead fifteen years.
In settling the matter the interests of
the Government, the company and the
public were to be considered. It had been
suggested that the Government take the
roads and run them. As far as the Cen
tral Pacific was concerned he favored the
Frye or Smith billsâ funding measure?.
Tne road, he thooent, could live up to the
requirements of cither of these measures.
The committee adjournod til! to-morrow,
when General Traffic Agent fcitubbs of the
Central Pacific will he heard.

and Wife. f
MAJOR GLEN RESIGNS.
His Withdrawal Likely to Be
Followed by That of Other
Leaders.
TALK OF SECESSION ENDS.
The Ex-Commender Will Turn Over
the Funds Deposited in His
Name.
)
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 26.â The Eng
lish brigadiers of the Salvation Army
headquarters are still firm in their support
of General William Booth of England in
his removal of the former commander,
Ballington Booth, from his position, but
the rank and file of the army, officered by
Americans, are still largely in favor of
their much-beloved commander and his
wife.
At the headquarters of the assembly the
situation to-day was not materially
changed from that of yesterday. The one
important change was the resignation of
Major Peter Glen and his wife. Major
Glen had been in charge of the field de
partment and was one of the most power
ful officers in the work, and his resigna
tion may be followed by that of other lead
ers.
The couple to-day sent a letter to Com
missioner Eva Booth, giving as a reason
for resigning that Commander and Mrs.
Ballington Booth had been dismissed
without a just cause. Major Glen said to
day that Ballington Booth had in no way
advised his resignation, and that his
action in withdrawing was entirely of rhs
own accord.
"Baljington Booth will not lead an
American army. " was the answer Major
Glen made to-day to questions about Mr.
Booth's "intentions. "He has received a
number of invitations to conduct evan
gelical meetings and very probably will
engage in some such work."
Mr. Glen also said that the published
reports that large sums of money had been
promised to Mr. and Mrs. Baliington
BootL to carry on any â work they might
desire were in a measure true. He said
that a committee of prominent citizens
had made such offers, but who they were
he would not say. Officers of the army
nave little fear that Ballington Booth will
not turn over the funds of the army in
this country, which are all deposited in
his name in various banks. He has
already signed checks for the current ex
penses of the organization.
Another account has been started in the
name of Eva Booth, to which all available
funds are added, but many of the contri
butions still come in the form of checks to
the order of Ballington Booth, which must
be deposited in the accounts in his name.
Colonel Eadie, one of the Salvation Army
leaders in is coutry, announces positively
that all danger of secession by the support
ers of the former commander, Bailington
Booth, is now past. All the brigadiers of
the army who, during the controversy be
tween the two factions, had been wavering,
are now ready to support General William
Booth of London against Mr. and Mrs.
Ballington Booth.
EXTEVDS TO THE COAST.
Salvation Army Members Affected by the
Dissension.
SEATTLE.Wash., Feb. 26.â The trouble
in the Salvation Army has extended to
this division, which includes \Vashington,
Oregon and the southern half of Idaho.
Major Percj' Morton is to be succeeded in
office by Major Adam Gifford of the South
ern Michigan division. The latter is now
en route and is expected to arrive at the
S-attle headquarters of the division on
Sunday.
Major Morton has been assigned to the
position of secretary of the Northwest
.on, with headquarters in Chicago.
The acting major of this division said to
:iiat he would not follow Ballington
Booth if the latter organized another
army. The deposed commander, he de
, was guilty of doing the very thing
that he, as commander of the army, was
continually tring to stamp out, to wit: in
subordination.
â¢As for nationalism in religion," he
continued, "I do not believe in it. Re
. should be world-wideâ bicger and
broader than any nation."
FORTUNE IN A TRUNK
Seventy Thousand Dollars Left
by a Man Who Lived
Upon Charity.
The Woman Who Cared for the Aged
Miser Not Remembered in
His Will.
SEW BRrNSWrcK, N\ J., Feb. 26.
--:-'.ircu made in an old black trunk at
I liver yesterday revealed the fact
:;,at Watson B. Prentiss, who died in that
on February 15, instead of being a
; oor man, was worth about $70,000. Pren
is,wbo had lived in South River for
vearp, had made his home for the
â¢ ; i,irty years with Mrs. Dunham. For
â . . ral years he had been almost helpless
Id age, and out of sympathy Mrs.
ham cared for him.
The old man never paid her any money,
,en said she would get all he had
â  :.. n he died. This led her to believe that
l'rvntiss had some money hidden away
â¢ shore, nut he never talked to her
nis affairs. His only known rela-
T \v:is a brother, Thomas Prentiss of
New York, whom Prcnti>s seldom saw.
A few <iays ;it<> it was learned that Pren
lad a will tiled with a lawyer in New
York. The will was made out in New
aid named executors who are now
â¢ I fed. By the will the brother and two
m oond nieces are made the sole heirs.
Mrs. Dunham's name was not mentioned.
After the will was found a search was
made for the old man's possessions. Yes
terday the old trunk was searched. The
ben were much surprised to und
beveral Government bonds in the trunk.
There were thirty $1000 bonds having un
paid coupons for fifteen and seventeen
years, in addition to deeds for $10,000
worth of property in Connecticut, a large
sum of money and valuable papers. An
inventory was taken of all the possessions,
amounting to $70,000.
Last Friday Thomas Prentiss and a law
yer called at the Surrogate's office and
wished to have the Surrogate take an in
ventory of the estate of the deceased. As
no jurisdiction had been given to the Sur
rogate this was not done. The brother and
the lawyer then went to Soutn River, and
taking the coods from the trunk deposited
them in a safety deposit vault in this city.
Thomas Prentiss has filed caveat against
the probatt of the will, and the jurisdiction
adjusting the estate now lies with the Or
phans' Court.
MUST PROVE THEIR CHARGES.
Sir Charles T upper to Sue the Publishers
of Two Newspapers for Mali
cious Libel.
OTTAWA, Okt., Feb. 26.â The Halifax
Chronicle and the Montreal Herald pub
lish an open letter from Robert McCon
nell, editor of the former paper, addressed
to Dr. Weldon, a member of Parliament
for Albert, N. 8., and C. H. Cahan, ex
member of Parliament, calling on them to
substantiate the charges which ho alleges
they recently made against Sir Charles
Tupper, late Canadian High Commissioner
to England and now Secretary of State in
the Dominion Cabinet.
The charges in question are, in effect,
that Sir Charles Tupper, when a member
of a former Cabinet, hishonestly obtained
$40,000 from the public purse, and as a con
sequence of such conduct he has not since
been entrusted by the Ottawa Government
with any important financial transaction
during his occupancy of his position as
High Commissioner.
Sir Cnarles Tupper denounces the charge
as a false and malicious libel and has di
rected that criminal proceedings be en
tered against the publishers of the Halifax
Chronicle and the Montreal Herald. Dr.
Weldon and Mr. Cahan both deny that
they ever made such charges against Sir
Charles Tupper.

About 500 of the Armenians consented,
but 150 refused, whereupon they were at
tacked and massacred. The correspondent

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1Â«96.
JUSTICE MUDDLED
AT SANTA ROSA
Two Judges and Two Dif- j
ferent Cases in One
Courtroom.
* â __ â .
MATTERS BADLY MIXED.
Double Sets of Deputy Sheriffs,
Clerks, Lawyers, Clients
and Witnesses.
A COMPLETE JUDICIAL TIE-UP.
Bailiffs Rush Frantically About, Un
able to Set the Machinery
in Motion.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. 26. â The
opening of Department 1 of the Superior
Court of this county this morning was not
attended by the decorum that usually per
vades that section of the Courthouse. On
the contrary, confusion reigned supreme.
There was a racing and chasing of Deputy
Sheriffs, there were orders given to clerks
that were as quicKly countermanded,
and the spectacle of two Judges, two sets
of litigants and lawyers and two swarms
of witnesses, all in one courtroom, afforded
the big crowd of spectators an unusual
sight.
Judge Daingerfield of San Francisco
held court in Department 1 yesterday in
the case of Wesley Mocks vs. the City of
Santa Rosa, sustaining the demurrer of
defendants to the affidavit of plaintiff ask
ing that the Mayor and Common Council
and Contractor Perkins show cause why
they should not be punished for contempt
of court.
This question having been disposed of,
court was adjourned until 9:30 o'clock this
morning to take up the petition of plaintiff
for an injunction restraining defendants
from further proceeaings on the new
water works.
Judge Dougherty, presiding Judge of the
Superior Court of this county, arrived at
the Courthouse this morning about 9
o'clock. His clerk and stenographer were
anxious to know where the third depart
ment of court would be held. â¢ He in
formed them that he would proceed at 10
o'clock with a criminal case in Depart
ment 1, and ordered them to be in readi
ness at that time.
At 9:30 Judge Daineerfield took a seat
upon the bench of Department 1 and
formally opened court, but there was no
clerk and no stenographer. The bailiff
was dispatched in hot haste to bring in the
missing officials, but returned shortly and
reported that the cleric could not be found,
and that the court reporter of that depart
ment refused to come.
Attorneys Lynch and Farquar for plain
tiff thereupon posted off to the clerk's
office and demanded 1 the papers in the
case, which County Clerk Fulton refused
to deliver.
At this stage of the judicial game noth
ing could exceed the stately calm of
Judge de Haven, special counsel for the
city, and his associates, Judge Rutledge
and City Attorney. Cowen, seemed quite
resigned to the situation. On the other
hand, Attorneys Lynch and Farquar, for
plaintiff, grew more excited every mo
ment, Mr. Farquar declaring it to be a
"job," and dramatically demanding to
know "where he was at."
Just at this time Judge Dougherty
stepped from the chambers into the court
room to try the criminal case upon his
calendar. The two Judges, after a few
words, withdrew to the chambers of the
presiding Judge, where they remained
closeted for nearly an hour. What took
place there only the Judges know, but
shortly before 11 o'clock Judge Dougherty
ascended the bench and called the case of
the People vs. Fisher. A jury being de
manded by the defendant, the case was
postponed until to-morrow at 10 o'clock to
allow a venire of thirty jurors to be j
drawn, and Judge Dougherty proceeded \
with the city case as soon as the criminal j
case was over.
A review of the case of Mock vs. The
City shows that Judge Dougherty, if not
disqualified by reason of being a tax
payer, felt some delicacy about trying the
case, and suggested to the attorneys that
he would request any Superior Judge
whom they might agree upon to come here
and hear the case in its various phases.
Accordingly the attorneys stipulated that
Judge Daihgerrield should be requested. .
On two or three occasions, the matter
appearing on the calendar, Judge Dainger
field was invited by the presiding Judge to
occupy his bench and accepted the invita
tion.
Later on the attorneys for plaintiff ap
peared before Judge Daineerfield in his
chambers in San Francisco with certain !
petitions and affidavits, upon which the
Judge made the orders now being dis
posed of.
These matters were set for February 10,
and on that day the San Francisco Judge,
without any special invitation, and in the
absence of Judge Dougherty, organized a
court and proceeded under the strenuous
objections of counsel for the city to hear
the motions, and after a partial hearing
the matter was continued until Feb
ruary 24.
Yesterday Judge Daingerfield again
opened court without an invitation from
the presiding Judge, which was held until
a late hour and adjourned to meet at 9:30
o'clock this morning, when the conflict of
jurisdiction occurred. .
In an interview with a Call representa
tive Judge Dougherty called attention to
section 71 of the Code of Civil Piocedure,
which reads: ? " ., \~:S
A Judge of any Superior Court may hold the
Superior Court in any county at the request of
the Judge or Judges of the Superior Court
thereof, and the Judge holding the court shall
have the same power as the Judge thereof. â -
Continuing, Judge Dougherty * said:
"My construction of this section is that
the power of a foreign Judge to act de
pends upon the request, and that the
power only exists while he is holding the
court; that he can only hold court in the
conn ty. when he is invited. No power to
act outside of the county is found in the
statute. Any other construction of this
section would lead to the greatest incon
venience and confusion, if the Judge
who has been invited once to hear one
phase of the case can construe it into a
continuous request and by reason thereof
entertain ex parte applications and set
them for fixed days in the court where he
was invited, he can disorganize the whole
of the court's calendar.
"The stipulation of the attorneys is not
an invitation or request that an outside
Judge shall hold court, but is simply a
stipulation that the court in which the
case is pending may invite a particular
Judge; otherwise attorneys might stipu
late a Judge clear off of the bench.
"It is my intention to carry dut this
stipulation and invite Judge Daingerfield
to sit in my place whenever I find the case
upon the calendar, but I think the orderly
and best practice would be for the attor
neys to submit their ex-parte applications
to me and let me request each time Judge
Daingerfield to come in and hear them,
otherwise I can set no case in this court
with any degree of safety."
In an interview Judge Daingerfield said:
"There was no clash of jurisdiction. lam
the acting Judge in the case, ana as such
should have entire charge of every phase
of it. The stipulation in the case precludes
Judge Dougherty from hearing any part
of it."
The attorneys in the case are ex-Su
preme Judge de Haven, Judge Rutledge
of Santa Rosa, Mr. Goodwin of San Fran
cisco and City Attorney Cowen, for the
city, and Attorney Lynch of San Francisco
and C. b. Farquar of Petaluma for plaintiff.

THE WILLOWS MURDER TRIAL.
Testimony All in antl the Case About to
Go to the Jury.
WILLOWS, Cal., Feb. 20.â Taking tes
timony in the Sehorn murder case came
to a sudden close this afternoon at 3
o'clock. After the defense announced that
they rested the prosecution only offered
one witness in rebuttal, calling Dr. Ran
dolph to rebut any theory that deceased
might have had a weapon upon his peison
at the time of the killing.
The defendant took the stand in his own
behalf, but was not kept a great leng;h of
time. In his direct testimony he said: "I
have carried a pistol for a great many
years, having been a peace officer under
Sheriffs of Glenn County as well as Colusa.
It is my invariable practice to put it un
der my pillow at night and in my pocket
in the morning. Putman knocked me
down and 1 thought my life was in danger
when I fired."
To a question on cross-examination wit
ness said he was not a peace officer at the
time of the homicide and had not been
since the Ist of January, 1805.
The argument will begin to-morrow
morrow morning and it is thought the case
may go to the jury to-morrow evening.

MILL VALLEY
WORKMEN STRIKE
Scenic Railroad Laborers
Allege Inhuman Treat-,
ment.
FOOD UNFIT FOR MEN.
Small Pay, Long Hours and
Hard Work Under Exact
ing Bosses.
MARCHED ABOUT LIKE FELONS.
It Is Said Chinamen and Italians Will
Be Employed at a Dollar
a Day.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., Feb. 26.â 1t is
reported that tbe laborers employed by
the California Construction Company in
the building of the Mill Valley and Mount
Tamalpais Scenic Railroad have gone on
a strike. At this hour it is too late to get
communication with the upper camp,
which is situated far up on the mountain,
and in which the men eat and sleep.
This morning six men came down from
the mountain and told terrible tales of the
way in which they were treated. They
stated that the others intended to leave
their jobs this afternoon.
Last Saturday seventeen men left the
employ of the construction company and
went to San Francisce, disgusted. One of
the men related his experience on the
mountain, and when he had half finished
his story he was seized with a tit and car
ried on at a terrible rate. It was Btated
that overwork and poor food brought on
the attack.
There are 150 men at work grading the
route of the road, and eyery day a number
leave. The men are working at a starva
tion figure, and the people are entirely in
sympathy with them. They are paid
$1 75 a day. Out of this sum they are
compelled to pay $5 25 a week for board
and 25 cents extra for every meal on Sun
days.
They are not allowed to purchase any
articles except from the store established
by the company. At the end of the week
the men have on hand usually about 90
cents or $1, seldom more.
One man who left the employ of the
construction company consented to tell
his story to a Call correspondent on con
i dition that his name be withheld, as he
feared he might be unable to obtain
another position if it became known that
he exposed the doings of the -company.
Said he:
"The food furnished the men is some
thing awfulâ even a dog might turn up
his nose at it. I havo been working at the '
upper camp and the hours are terrible. In I
order to gel breakfast and walk up to the i
trail of the road the men must get up at i
5 o'clock in the morninc. At noon one
hour is allowed for dinner and the men
are marched back to camp, some two
miles distant, in the Broiling sun, where
they are fed stuff that is vile. Then the
j tramp back to the road is begun up the
mountain, and all this must be accom
plished within one hour. The men then
work until 6 in the evening, when back to
camp they march for supper.
"The reception at camp is most un
pleasant on account of the food. The men
i growl and are told that there are plenty
I ready and willing to take their places.
The place provided in which to sleep is
and a man could hardly live a
more wretched life."
At the headquarters of the teamsters in
Mill Valley a scene toot place that
illustrates now the men accept the situa- j
tion. A number of the men were seated
at dinner when the Chinese cook brought
jin a lot of potatoes which were harci. The
I men asued for better ones and the cook
i said there were no others. With this the
I men each grabbed a potato and com
menced to throw them at the Chinaman.
The poor fellow made his escape rather
the worse for the treatment, while the
room was literally covered with smashed
potatoes.
The commissary started to remonstrate,
and he also was treated to a similar experi
ence.
The feeling in Mill Valley is strong
among those who have come in contact
with the men. Every one agrees that the
pay is outrageous, and the men are a unit
in denouncing the food.
It is now stated that the construction
company having the work of building the
road in chanre intends to hire Italians
and Chinese at $1 a day and put them to
1 | work at once.
The railroad people say that many men
have gone back to San Francisco during
! the last few days with their blankets and
traps. ____________
SANTA ANITA SHOOTING
In a Drunken Quarrel One Mexi
can Is Dangerously Wounded
by Another.
The Assailant Escapes to the Hills
and Is Being Pursued by
Officers.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 26.â Early
this morning Sheriff Burr received a tele
phone message from Deputy Sheriff Wil
son from San Gabriel that a tragedy had
been enacted at Santa Anita, and that he
needed assistance from the Sheriff's office
to arrest a murderer. It seems that two
Mexicans, named Morales and Ramon,
began last night to drink and quarrel,
with the result of Ramon being shot sev
eral times. The wounded man lies still in
a precarious condition.
The snot that was supposed to have en
tered his eye did not enter the eye, but
struck the hard bone above and glanced,
making a flesh wound. He has another
wound in the thigh. The man lies in a
shed on the Baldwin ranch, to which he
which he has been removed, and there is
some slight chance of his recovery.
Soon after the shooting the assailant
went up into one of the nearby canyons
and barricaded himself. He had taken to
his redoubt a Winchester ritle, a couple of
revolvers and a quantity of ammunition.
Deputy Sheriff Wilson stated that it was
plain that the man had determined to re
sist to the utmost and would probably pre
fer being killed to being captured.
Deputy Sheriffs Woodward and Barnhiil
returned from their chase this afternoon.
The fugitive, whose name is Joseph Mo
rales, decided not to die so heroically and
iost himself in the Santa Anita Canyon.
The posse hunted for him, but failed to get
him. They think that Morales will come
out of the canyon soon when the pangs of
hunger attack him.
AGAIXST SUXDAT WORK.
Methodist Preachers of Los Angeles Peti
tion the City Council.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. Feb. 26.â At the
meeting of the Council Monday a petition
will De read from the Methodist preachers'
meeting asking that that body do what it
can to slop Sunday work on streets and
sewers.
"The grading of streets on this day,"
says the petition, "has in some instances
interfered with church services and other
wise annoyed peaceable and law-abiding
citizens. .We therefore respectfully ask
you to pass an ordinance prohibiting all
public work on that day except in case of
necessity."
There is no State law against working
on Sunday, and several Coancilmen who
read, the petition this morning are at a
loss "to know what to do in the matter.
Every contract for street, sewer and other
kind of public work provides that those
employed shall not work more than eight
hours a day, but nothing is. said about
Sunday. . v
A LOS JLTiUELKS MAW 8 FIXD,

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 26.â A de
serted baby boy about five weeks old was
found on the front porch of the residence
of John Grant, 412 North Walnut street,
East Los Angeles, this morning.
At the time mentioned the faint cry of a
child was heard, and upon investigation
the babe was discovered. Its clothes are

in a blanket. It is exceedingly bright for
its age. Officers are engaged on the mys

THE KILBRANNAN FLOATS
After Being Given Up as a
Wreck the Big British Ship
Is Rescued.
Towed to Hadlock. Where She Was
Beached and Will Undergo
Repairs.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. 26.â
With an ease surprising even to those who
accomplished it, the big stranded British
ship Kilbrannan was hauled into deep
water this morning about 4 o'clock. No \
one ever expected to see the vessel afloat !
again after two attempts did not succeed \
In moving the vessel ten feet.
The previous efforts were made with a !
j full force of the tugs of the local company , i
I but the vessel did not budge in her sandy â â 
I bed. This morning two vessels hooked â 
|on to her and with ease the vessel was j
pulled into deep water and then directly
to Hadlock, where she was beached, the j
big pumps in ihe meantime working to |
keep the hold free from the torrents that !
poured in from her shattered and punc- |
tured bottom.
The vessel will undergo temporary re- I
pairs on the soft beach at Hadlock and
j will thÂ»n be taken directly to the drydock
! at Quartermasters Harbor, where it will
i be easy to remedy all the damage which
has resulted from being ashore for three
weeks.
It was not the intention to make the
effort until to-morrow, but yesterday the
crew working with the capstans on ked^e
anchors moved her forty feet, and it was
deemed advisable to go to work at once
before she could settle into the shingle
beach again.

Grade Smith of Roseburg
Brings Grief Into Her
Family.
WEDDED TO A BAD MAN.
He Hopes Through the Marriage
to Kill an Indictment
Against Him,
; THREE ANGRY BIG BROTHERS.
They Vow Vengeance on Their New
Relative Should They Ever
Meet Him.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 26. â Monday
night R. Baney Matthews, a Rcseburg tin
horn gambler, 40 years of age, eloped with
Gracie Smith, the 16-year-old daughter of a
respectable pioneer family of that place.
They were married at Vancouver and are
at the Hotel Perkins here. Matthews nas
twice before had wives, the first woman
dying and the second securing a divorce.
His habits of life are such as to ostracise
him from association with good people.
He is at present under $5000 bonds to
answer to an indictment found by a Grand
Jury charging him with criminal assault
upon the child now his wife. The in
ference is that through this marriage Mat
thews expects to kill the indictment.
However, there are forces other than the
law that EL Baney Matthews has yet to
deal witn. His girl-wite is the youngest
of six children, and aside from the vener
able father of Gracie, ex-Judge Thomas
Smith, there are three stalwart men to
whom Matthews has yet to account. They
are the three brothers of his wife, and if the
information of J. B. Beckley, son of Sena
tor Henry Beckley, is correct, Matthews
may expect to receive a handling; from his
brothers-in-law that wili go far toward
dulling the edge of pleasure incident to
his third plunge into the matrimonial sea.
Mr. Beckley said this morning: "The
; family is heartbroken over the action of
I their baby girl, and have the sympathy of
I every man and woman in Southern Ore
i con irrespective of station or profession.
{ But there is a stronger element in the
I Smith family than the old folks, and that
iis the brothers and male relatives of
{ Gracie. Already these men are prepared
I for action, and I make no idle speech
j when I say woe be unto Matthews should
i he dare to show his face in Roseburg with
j the child bride he has stolen away."
"The man has been twice married, and to
i think that his eyes should light upon but
| a mere child for a satiation of nis animal
I instinct, never giving a thought to the
I ruin and sorrow that would follow his act,
| it seems as though reparation must follow.
Gracie was led away by flattery, her giddy
young bead being turned by the smooth,
! suave speech of Matthews. At one stroke
she has separated herself from father,
mother and home, and for what?â to be
come the wife of a man twenty years older
than she, who married her to save himself
I from the criminal prosecution hanging
over his head."
Mr. Beckley states that the people of
Roseburg are worked up to such a pitch
over the elopement that, even should the
brothers of the girl not act, it is more than
likely the citizens would make a demon
i stration should Matthews return.

NO LAW TO STOP THE BUSINESS.
Inclosed in Rough Wooden Boxes,
the Corpses Are Labeled
" Merchandise."
SEATTLE, "Wash., Feb. 26.â A local offi
cial of the Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany some days ago made the statement
that bodies of human beings were being
systematically snatched from the ceme
teries of this city and sent as surgery sub
jects and for scientific purposes to medical
colleges in San Francisco. At least two
corpses, he asserted, were shipped to the
Pacific Coast metropolis via the steamer
Walla "Walla on her last trip down. They
were inclosed in rout:h wooden boxes and
labeled merchandise. The official in ques
tion declined to enter into details, but he
intimated that this grave-robbery enter
prise had been carried on for many months.
A local paper publishes a story to this
effect this afternoon and the authorities
are investigating the matter, though it
appears that the laws of this State do not ;
prohibit such nefarious business, for Hill's
Annotated Statutes and Cocies of Wash- |
fngton say :
"Any Shenff, Coroner, keeper of a coun
ty poorhouse, public hosdital. County Jail I
or Bl s Prsson must surrender the dead !
bodi of such persons as are required to j
be b: ried at public expense, to any physi
cian or surgeon, to be by him used for the â¢
advancement of anatomical science, pref- .
erence being always given to medical i
schools for their use in the instruction of
medical students."
There are seven or eight cemc es in
this city, all being practically vi arded
at night. Some are situated clr â¢to the
heart of the city, while others a on the
extreme outskirts, though all are easy of .
access either by streetcars or railway. The
County Hospital cemetery, where the pau
per dead are buried, is located on the Dv- i
vanish River, which empties into the i
sound.
Tt would be ?.n easy matter to bring '
bodies by steamer at night to this port :
and put them abonrd ocean-goinp vessels.
However, the probabilities are that the
majority of the bodies are being taken
from public burying-grounds, as there is
only an occasional interment on the I
County Farm.
Lyman W. Bonr.ey, the veteran under- }
taker of Seattle, while disposed to dis
credit the body-snatching story, said it
would be an easy thing to carry on such !
an undertaking, as many cemeteries of ,
the city were practically unguarded, j
especially during the night.
FR ESN OS RAISIN CROP.
Parkers and Shippers Hold an Impor

FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 26.â The second
meeting of the raisin packers and shippers
of the San Joaquin Valley for the purpose
of a conference looking to a plan for hand
ling the crop of 1?&<5 was held at the
Hughes Hotel here this afternoon and
evening, at which nearly all the commis
sion packers were present, representing
many thousands of dollars. The former
conference meeting was held in San Fran
cisco.
At the meeting this evening consider
able progress was made in the direction of
unity of action, which promises results of
the greatest importance to all concerned
in the production and marketing of
raisins. Committees of the One Hundred
Thousand Club of this county have had
the matter under consideration for some
time and at least one member of its execu
tive committee was present at the confer
ence this evening.
The club at its meeting to-night in
structed its secretary to invite these gen
tlemen to attend a future meeting of the
club and address it on this important sub
ject. The producers are to be invited to
express themselves at some future meet
ing also, and that by means of these con
ferences a practical plan will be evolved to
consummate the purposes desired.
THE IRRIGATION TAX.
Tiaaliana Organize to Teat the Validity

VISALIA, Cal., Feb. 26.â W. Clarke on
Tuesday afternoon filed a petition in the
Tulare County Superior Court enjoining
the Collector of the Alta Irrigation dis
trict from selling his property to satify the
unpaid irrigation tax of 1896. The object
of this suit is to 6tay the proceedings until
the Supreme Court of the United State 3
Las passed upon the constitutionality of
the Wright law, upon which all irrigation
districts are predicated. Clame's petition
was accompanied by a bond of *2000.
signed by himself, E. Jacob and John
Cutler, all large property-owners in the
Alta district. An injunction pendente
lite was granted by Judge Ross. A num
ber of the heaviest taxpayers in that part
of the district lying in Tulare County have
organized to take the above action and
test the validity of the irrigation district.

The town was incorporated a short time

PEARL BRYAN'S SLAYER.
Scott Jackson Is Practically
Convicted by His Own
Confession.
His Intimacy With the Unfortunate
Girl Admitted in a Jail
Interview.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Feb. 26.â Scott
Jackson, in an exciting interview with
a reporter at the jail this morning,
confessed to having had improper rela
tions with Pearl Bryan. This is the most
important confession of the prisoner since
his imprisonment.
Ever since his arrest, Jackson has held
out again3t overwhelming facts, that his
relations with Pearl Bryan were abso
lutely honorable, and that his sole pui
pose in having her come to Cincinnati and
undergo an operation was to protect his
friend, William Wood. In the interview
Wood is almost vindicated. Had he not
written the series of disgusting letters to
Jackson he would have been a free man
to-day.
Both Jackson and Wood admitted that
Dr. Gillespie had strongly ureed Jackson to
marry Pearl Bryan. Wood, when seen
after the Jackson interview, talked about
the Gillespie interview with little reserve.
He was not informed of what Jackson had
confessed. He unconsciously corroborated
Jackson's story, except the matter of his
(Wood's) confessing to having been too
intimate with his second cousin.

AN OLD MINER'S
SAD SUICIDE
! How He Lost a Claim
Worth a Million
Dollars.
A TREACHEROUS FRIEND
Betrayed by a Man Whom He
Had Camped With and
Fed for Years.
INFAMY PROPERLY PUNISHED.
The First Tragedy Reported Since
the Opening of the Colville
Reservation.
SPOKANE, Wash., Feb. 26.â Word has
been received from Northport that O. C.
Cox, the old prospector who tried to com
mit suicide yesterday, is dead, and thereby
hangs a tale.
Five years ago Cox, with Dan Crown,
was on the reservation opposite to the
town of Northport. While climbing to
the top of a hill to locate themselvesâ for
the whole country was unsettled at that
time â they found a very rich ledge,
samples of which assayed between $400
and $500 and which in character is ident
ical to the famous Silver King, near Nel
son, B. C. There was little prospects of
the reservation being opened for years,
but they covered the exposed part of the
ledge and it is now fully covered over by
grass and dirt.
Shortly after this Cox met Ed Cowan,
one of the best newspaper men in the
State, and to him he told of the find, and
together the three were to wait patiently
until the hour arrived and then locate the
mine that was to make them both rich
and happy.
Cox, during all these years, prospected
around in this State and British Columbia,
but only to live, for he was waiting for the
great-to-be mine. At last the hour came,
and to Crown was left the work of doing
the skirmishing to get there first, for he
was strong and healthy, while Cox was
getting old and weak.
Cowan for the past, several months has
been at Rossland, and there made known
his knowledge of the ledge.
Several men got around him and in
duced him to leave Cox and Crown and
locate them, and this he finally agreed to
do. Then it was suggested thak if the loca
tion notice showed his name his former
partners might suspect him, and so when
be made the rush and located bis own
name was left out.
The men whose names were attached,
however, stopped him, and giving him
the laugh refused to deed him any interest
in the mine, and when Cox went to get
| his interest from Cowan he learned not
j only that he had lost the mine he had
! waited years to get, but that the man he
; had treated as a friend and brother, the
! man he had camped with and fed for
: years, bad deliberately sold out this
j friendship for a mess of pottage and had
i not received the pottage.
Cox was getting old and the thought of
I all this was too much for him, and walk
ing down to the Columbia River, near
i Northport, he jumped in, but fortunately
several men suspected his intent and fol
lowed him. Tbey pulled him out and
persuaded him to come back uptown.
When they got uptown he started off
ahead of his guardians and they followed
a short distance behind. Presently he
pulled a hunting knife from his pocket
and placed the point of it against his
breast under his vest and immediately
over the heart.
Holding the knife in his left hand, with
his right fist he struck the end of the
handle several times to dri^e the blade in.
It penetrated deeply, grazing the heart
and inflicting a ghastly wound, and he
fell to the ground. He was picked up and
carried into a saloon near by and a physi
cian was called.
The mine is said to be a very valuable
one. Marcus Daly has already offered to
bond it for $1,000,000. This is the first
tragedj r on the opening of the new
reservation.

WASHINGTON, D., C. Feb. 26.-In
making the selection of a Consul at Cape
Town, South Africa, which fell upon
James H. Mulligan of Kentucky, whose
name was sent to ' the Senate to-day, the
President ; and Secretary , Olney exercised
the greatest care in view of the important
position which the Consul will occupy with
reference vto r the Transvaal disturbances
and the arrest of John Hays Hammond
and other American citizens.
In order, however, to secure for the
position a standing that would make it
acceptable to a man of prominence, Mr.
Olney requested the Senate Committee on
Appropriations to insert in the diplomatic
and consular appropriation bill, which had
been passed by the House, a paragraph
increasing the salary of the Cape Town
oihee from $2000 to 's3ooo a year. This
provision was adopted, and Mr. Mulligan's
nomination followed.
<-.*/â¢ Mulligan is bornt on the rolls of the
Mate Department as Consul-General at
Apia, Samoa, but he tendered his resig
nation of that oihee, having recently re
turned to the United States for that
purpose.

HER HUSBAND IS MISSING
Strange Disappearance of Robert
Buchanan, a Railroad
Engineer.
He Came to This City From Sausalito
Two Weeks Ago and Has Not
Returned Home.
The police have been for several days
vainly trying to elucidate the mystery of
the disappearance of Robert Buchanan,
engineer-on the North Pacific Coast Rail
road.
Buchanan lived with his wife and two
little girls in San Rafael. He left his home
as usual on the morning of Wednesday,
February 12. His wife expected him to
return in the evening to dinner, after put
ting his engine up in the yards at Sausa
lito, but she was disappointed.
She made inquiry next day and learned
ROBERT BUCHANAN.
that after putting his engine up he drew
hia wages â $95 â and paid a bill of $15. He
came to this City on the last boat that
night and next day she got a note from
him that he would be home on Saturday
night. He did not keep his promise and
on Monday she got a dispatch from him
that he would be home on Tuesday morn
ing. She waited for two or three days in
tha expectation that he would return home
and then she came here and notified the
police.
Everything has been done sinc9 then by
the police to get a trace of him, but with
out success, and yesterday Mrs. Buchanan,
accompanied by her mother, called again
at police headquarters and asked the help
of the press to hud her missing husband.
Both ladies were deeply affected.
"I cannot understand my husband's ab
sence," said Mrs. Buchanan, "and I am
afraid he has met with foul play. He was
never away from home before, and he was
so considerate that if his train was an
hour or so late he would >vire me to keep
dinner waiting for him. He was not a
drinking man, but when he met some
friends occasionally he was always jolly
and free with his money."
Buchanan is 2fÂ» years of age, 5 feet 6%
inches tall, of light complexion, heavy
light-colored mustache, ana was dressed in
a dark blue sacK coat and vest and light
colored blue trousers.
MILLIONAIRES LAZARD.
The Money Princes of Paris, London
and New York Here for
Pleasure.
Andre Lazard and Max Lazard, the mil
lionaire bankers of Paris, London and
New York, arrived here yesterday and
are at the Palace.
They are the sons of M. Lazard of
Lazard, Freres & Co., the early bankers of
San Francisco, for it was in this City that
the elder Lazard laid the foundation for
the enormous fortune which has resulted
from his investments and those of his sons.
The two young men here are of the farm
of Lazard Bros. <fc Co., Paris. In London
and New York the firm retains its old
name, that of Lazard, Freres & Co.
Their old house of Lazard, Freres &
Co. here has been succeeded in name by
the London, Paris and American Bank
but the Lazards are largely interested iii
it. Itjis recognized as their bank.
The house of Lazard, Freres & Co. ex
ports much more gold than any other firm
in New York. It does an enormous ex
change business.
Raphael Weil will entertain the notable
visitors considerably during their stay.
They are here for pleasure, solely, so it is
stated. It is expected they will remain
two or three weeks at least.
The average production of wine in
France for the last ten years has been in
round figures, 686,296,000 gallons, and the
figures as to last year's yield in France
ana other countries indicate that France
is again the largest producer.
JOAQUIN MILLER
AT PALO ALTO
The Poet of the Sierras
Lectures on "Hints
From Nature."
AMERICAN DISCONTENT.
â¢
Hard Raps at Wealthy Citizens
Who Spend Their Money
Abroad.
NATURE NEGLECTED FOR ART.
Witty Illustrations and Quaint Stories
That Delight a Large
Assemblage.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Feb.
26. â One of the largest audiences that ever
assembled to hear a lecture here congre
gated last evening to hear Joaquin Miller,
the "Poet of the Sierras." His witty illus
trations and quaint stories were heartily
applauded. The subject of his lecture was
"Hints From Nature."
In substance he said: A good many
years ago, nearly a dozen, I came home
after some years in other lands and went
up into the mountains to meditate on and
digest what I had seen and studied abroad.
It struck me that the Americans are more
unhappy than Europeans. In their money
getting greedy Americans â that 13, the
massesâ are not content. The reason is
that the American is not at peace with
himself; he is not near himself.
The trouble is that he fails to feel and
fails to strive to understand nature. This
is not so in England. The English gentle
man goes abroad and makes money, but
spends it at home on his country estate;
the American makes it at home and
spends it not on naturo, but on art abroad.
We Americans are not humorous; we
are a grimly sad people. Let us have
light, and let that light come from nature.
Consider the very first words in the one
great book of all poetry if you want that
light. If you care for color you have it all
about you.
And the perfume. What do we know of
this? The perfume of the great robust
jocund mountain, when the whole world
hangs heavy with sweet odors; and the
snow â "Hast thou seen the treasures or
the snow?" sang Job, so far back that we
knoT not the date. There ha 3 never been
anything of man's handiwork that matches
the single flake of snow.
Have you seen the highborn rain that
falls on all alike? I love the rain, and
the little door of my hut on the moun
tain side is always open, rain or shine.
And the wind that walks arm in arm with
the rain, and the thunder and lightning
flashes.
You cannot lie to nature as you can to
mortal man. When you have learned all
that books can teach remember you have
but begun.
It takes time to understand and appre
ciate nature. You must understand her
alphabet if you would understand her
moods and temperament. Learn to see
the poppy on the bird's breast and to hear
its song, whose music Patti may never
equal.
One thing that robs nature of her rights
is superfluity of words; yet Burns wrote in
less than 4000, and the Bible such poetry
as has not been since written in 7000.
Closing, the poet said: "The man who
can despise luxury and toil with his hands
is an exceedingly rich man. Remember
that we begin the next life precisely where
we leave off this. Be not blinded to this
beautiful world, but live and love it. Be
gin to-day. There are millions of to-mor
rows; there is only one to-day.
"Come, listen, O love, to the voice of the dove,
And hearken, I hear him say.
There are many to-morrows, my love, my love;
There is only one to-day."
THE FIGHT WITH RAINEY.
George Maxwell "Roasts" Gavin
McNab and Others in a
Tale of Woe.
A New Election Is Ordered in the
Forty-Fourth and More Trouble
Brews.
Amid the strong possibility that Sam
Rainey, working with Ed Lanigan and tne
i Daggett forces, has assumed control of the
Junta's organization, there is an immense
amount of bustling in the line of district
politics.
In the Junta organization there are sore
spots in many districts since the primary
Monday night, and there is much activity
among district bosslets. The Buckleyites
are taking a keen interest in Junta politics,
and they have several men in the new
general committee elected Monday nhht.
The Buckleyites watched the Junta
primary the other evening like hawks. In
every district a selected committee of four
or five Buckley men watched the election
in every district with as much keenness as
tnough they were election officers. There
was a meeting at the Occidental Club
night before last at which verbal reports
of the doings in every district were made.
Written reports signed by the special com
mittees were ordered sent in and a num
ber were turned in last night.
The number of ballots actually cast is
stated in many cases at about fifty, and
far less than the number reported cast
Ihe reports from some of the districts tell
of a good many individuals who are al
leged to have voted several times, and
some of the reports include names of dele
gates to the new general committee who
are said to be Republicans, non-residents
of the districts and so on. It is the inten
tion to prepare a lot of affidavits in ac
cordance with these reports for possible
use in making war on the Junta in the
future.
But the BuckleyiteÃ are not worrying
anybody now. The fight with Sam Rainey
m the organization gives interest enough
Bobs McNab, Chairman Sullivan and
bamuel Brauudart scout the idea of
Rainey having secured the works Max
Popper and others hardly believe he has
and are waiting until the new committee
meets to see. A great many active men
ni the Junta organization believe and say
that Rainey will be found in control.
The test will come when the new com
mittee meets for organizationâ probably
next week. That meeting promises to be
a warm ana tumultuous one. The main.
fight will occur at the outset, over the
seating of the twenty-live delegates from
the Forty-fourth, nominated by George
Maxwell, secretary of the Fire Commission,
in defiance of Chairman Sullivan, and
unanimously elected. The primary com
mittee strongly supports Chairman Sulli
van and Gavin McNab in their refusal to
give the Rainey element in that district
more than eleven of the twenty-five dele
gates, irrespective of the results of a
primary election. It has ordered a new
election in that district and left its time
and management to Chairman Sullivan.
It will likely be held this week, and an
other ticket will be sent from headquar
ters, with a committee of election officers.
"Whether Maxwell and his people will
have anytning to do with the new election
is doubtful. Maxwell says that he will not.
The feeling is very bitter with the
Rainey people over the Forty-fourth Dis
trict affair. Maxwell yesterday cleared
his decks and went for Chairman Sulli
van, Gavin McNab, Max Popper and
Samuel Braunhart in this fashion:
The members of the party apparently have
no rights that these people are bound to re
spect. Colonel Sullivan assured me that every
body would get fairly treated and 011 that
assumption I went into the movement against
Buckley in the Interest of the Fire Department
and did all I could to get people into the
organization. I had the assurances of Suili
van, McXftb ana others that every man nomi
nated by the club whose dollar was paid would
go on the ticket. Our club nominated a ticket
of twenty-five in regular way and complied
with every rule. Then they said we couldn't
nominate but eleven, and fourteen would be
arbitrarily selected at headquarters for the
ticket.
We didn't care how many nominations we
made, but we were entitled to nominations at
least, and let the election settie who should
represent the district. This was all done to
discipline me because I was a friend of Rainey.
Sullivan at first said that I would not only
have eleven solid, but the best oi the fourteen.
I refused anything on that basis.
Now ?ee whai Sullivan could do. Two nights
later he said to my brother, "What's the mat
ter with George?' and proposed that he would
name fourteen of my friend's, but that I ? Mould
get out and kick and pretend to be dissatisfied
beouuse I didn't have a majority. He said
something of that sort was necessary to make
it appear 10 the public that Rainey was not in
control. I laughed at the proposition and
didn't go to see Sullivan about it.
Then ex-Supervisor John Foley of the Forty
fifth, who is out for Senator, came to me and
wanted to tie me up in his Senatorial fight. I
retused and a week later he came and urged
me to settle the thing. He told me ttiat
Samuel Braunhart had been to William j
Raubinger in that district and asked for the j
names of some good Democrats in that district ]
to be appointed on the ticket. Raubinger goes |
to Foley and Foley comes to me. 1 would not .
name any men to be put in at headquarters
and told Foley that I was fighting for a prin
ciple and our rights.
Che joker in all this was that if they could
have worked such a scheme with me they
could go to kickers in other districts and say":
'â¢See here. Maxwell has been called down and
he's had to quit, and now you've got to." Now
they can have a new election. I won't go near
it. Our twenty-five are entitled to seats if
anybody ever was.
The result of all this will "be that the Junta
will go to pieces. There is dissatisfaction with
these dictators everywhere. I tried to get a
constitution and by-laws adopted and told
Sullivan and McXab'that it was nothing but a
disorganized political mob, but they wanted
to be the law, as they are.
McNab is one of the most unreliable and de
ceitful men I ever met. I said to a friend of
his some time ago, "What sort of a fellow is
this McNab that you've got me tied up with' 7 "
He laughed and said, "well, he's like that dog
in Ireland that would go part of the road with
everybody." Popper ia unreliable, Sullivan |
has lied to me and Kraunhart is a political im
beciie, and so excusable for anything he may
do. They are the most unsatisfactory men to |
do politics with I ever saw, and I'm sorry I
ever had anything to do witn them. There
isn't one of them who could go up against a
fair primary and carry his own district.

; Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla is daily winning favor on the entire Pacific Coast, and
the reason is quite clear. Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla does the work expected and
.with no bad effects. When you take a Sarsaparilla and experience immediate relief
without showing blood blotches and pimples on your face you know and your doctor
will tell you that such a sarsaparilla must be made up of vegetable herbs and contains
no mineral drugs, ,no iodide of potassium. The experience of Mr. Theodore Stacke is
the experience of all who have used Joys Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
i Mr. T. Stacke lives at the Santa Rosa Hotel, cor. Fourth and San Pedro streets, Los
Angeles, Gal. He has used several bottles of the native Saraaparilla, and is now convinced
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla is best, "for," said he, "when I began using, the Sarsa-
parilla I had a desire to rest all the time. My blood was disordered, ray tongue coated.
At times, just for a moment my head swam; I was not the least bit dizzy. I Knew ray
needs and determined to use a bottle of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. I easily pro-
cured the first bottle, and after using for six days felt better in every way. When I
bought the second bottle I had a little trouble in getting it. The drug clerk tried to
talk me into using something else. I knew what I wanted and insisted on getting
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. lam heartily glad I bought the remedy and will gladly
recommend it to any one. Joy's is certainly fine."
Many persons write complaining that they ask their druggist for Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla and something else was offered. Be sure you get Joy's Vegetable SarsÂ«-

ARREST OF DOLE.
Captain Lees Receive* an Order to Ap
prehend a Man Charged With
Forgery.
Captain Lees received a dispatch on
Tuesday from Chief of Police Glass of Los
Angeles to arrest E. J. Dole, an attorney
of that city, who was wanted there for
foreery.
Yesterday the Captain received another
dispatch that Dole had writtm to a friend
from the Occidental Hotel on Monday.
Detectives Whitaker and Seymour and
Policeman Hall were detailed on the case
and arrested Dole in the Occidental last
evening and locked him up In the City
Prison. The Captain immediately wired
Chief Glass of the arrest and to send a man
on to take Dole back. The Captain thought
the case an important one from the
urgency of the dispatches.
Dole said he was at a loss to know for
what he was arrested. He had gone to Los
Angeles in 1886 for his health, and took up
ranching for a year or two. Then he
commenced to practice law.

â¢
There was a stormy scene at last night's
session of the ecclesiastical council which
for a time threatened total disruption of
that body, as well as a small-sized fistic
carnival between the adherents of Dr.
Brown and those opposed to him.
It all came about in the cross-examina
tion of Mrs. Thurston. That lady had
made very damaging statements relative
to the alleged relations existing between
the pastor and Miss Overman, during the
recital of which Dr. Brown, his wife and
- Miss Overman appeared to be very much
amused.
Dr. Brown asked Mrs. Thurston if it
were not true that she had a great deal of
trouble with her husband â in fact, if she
were not extremely jealous of the atten
tions which he is alleged to have showered
on his lady acquaintances. The judge-advo
cate objected to this sort of cross-examina
tion, but said that if the council desired to
hear it he would not oppose.
â '- Dr. Brown, his face white and livid with
rage, apparently, leaped to his feet and
said:
"It is strange that objections continually
come to the questions asked by tne de
fense, but no limit is put upon the prose
cution. I wish to go on record here now
as saying that the moderator and one or
two members of the council have at times
been unfair toward me."
Mr. McLean, smarting under the insinu
ation, rose to his feet, and making a step
forward, asked if Dr. Brown meant to im
ply any wrongdoing to him.
The pastor said that he had nothing to
take back, but to the contrary would in
sist that the moderator had been unfair.
Then followed a wordy war, in which
every member of the council participated.
The venerable moderator insisted that
Dr. Brown answer his question and then
called upon the council to institute an im
mediate investigation as to the truth or
falsity of the insinuation. Resolutions
and counter resolutions were offered, some
sustaining Dr. McLean and others assum
ing a more conciliatory tone. In the general
hubbub some one suggested that it would
be rather a queer proceeding for an investi
gating council to investigate itself.
Mr. Dodge thought that a mere expres
sion of confidence in the moderator from
the council was sufficient proof that Dr.
Brown's insinuations of unfairness were
groundless. Any action, therefore, in the
way of an investigation, might cause some
people to think that Dr. Brown was at
least partly right.
l3r. Brown attempted to make another
speech when the Rev. Dr. Mooar of Oak
land interrupted him saying, "This man
has taken up too much time of the council
already. I move that we proceed with the
investigation."
The excited pastor said he was not sure
that he wanted the council to go on, but
a few moments later somebody threw oil
on the troubled waters and peace reigned
again.
. Dr. Brown hoped that the council would
recollect the fact that he had been under
a terrible strain for the past sixty days
and was not altogether responsible for his
words. He regretted very much the un
pleasantness that had occurred and asked
that all be forgotten and forgiven. He as
cured the moderator that he had the high
est possible regard for him as a man who
wanted to see only justice done and hoped
that he would not treasure up the angry
words which had escaped him.
Dr. McLean, evidently much relieved at
the turn affair 3 had taken, said that
he too regretted the unusual scene, and
begged to assure the pastor of his personal
regard and also his desire to act in all
matters coming before the council justly
and fairly.
During the discussion the friends and
enemies cheered and hissed according to
their several moods. In the midst of the
exciting interchange of words Archie Mc-
Millan, whose name has been unpleasantly
associated with that of Mrs. Stockton,
sprang to the platform and in tones which
could have been heard a block away de
clared that he Lad something to say about
Dr. Brown's peculiar actions. The mod
erator, however, persuaded him to leave
the room, assuring him that at the proper
: time he would be heard.
And so ended the most dramatic inci
dent of the entire deliberation, not except
ing Mrs. Blanchard's hysterical display
last. week.
By far the largest crowd of any gathered
to hear the deliberations of the ecclesiasti
cal council assembled in the lecture-room of
the First Congregational Church yesterday,
attracted probably by the announcement
that Mrs. Mary A. Davidson, the pastor's
chief accuser, and incidentally his alleged
blackmailer, was to testify.
But the morbidly curious who had hoped
to hear a racy exposition of an incident
capable of the broadest criticism, if true,
were doomed to disappointment.
Mrs. Davidson did not appear before the
council, and what is more disappointing
to some, probably never will. Walter Gal
lagher is no longer the legal adviser of the
accused woman and this refusal to repeat
in church what had been sworn to in open
court is credited to George Knight, who
has undertaken to handle her cause before
the Superior Court- There was a quiet
rumor floating around" the church to the
effect that the pastor's friends had brought
about this condition of things, but this is
bitterly resented by them.
Judge Advocate Woodhams said that in
view of Mrs. Davidson's non- appearance
he was forced to do the next best thing,
and that was to read the testimony given
in Judge Campbell's court. Dr. Brown
.wished to know in the event Mrs. David
son changed her mind concerning her ap
pearance before the council if she would be
allowed to do so. "Woodhanis said yes, but
ARCHIE McMILLAN WISHES TO BE HEARD BY THE COUNCIL.
she would be questioned only on matters ]
not named in the statement.-
Here followed a long and tiresome read- [
ing of the testimony given by Mrs. David
son in the Police Court, after which Dr.
Brown was permitted to offer in rebuttal
the cross-examination taken at the same
time.
Mrs. Thurston was 'the most interesting
witness examined during the day. She |
told of humorous conversations with Miss I
Overman, in which the latter had practi- j
cally admitted an undying affection for
the pastor. Miss Overman told her that I
the doctor had squeezed her hand, and !
was at all times loving and kind in his
demonstrations toward her.
"I told her to be careful," said Mrs.
Thurston, whereupon she replied: "How
smart of you to guess my secret
Then Mrs. Thurston recited in a purely !
matter of fact though effective way of nu
merous confidential talus with Mr?. Tun- I
nell coneernine Mattie Overman and Dr. ;
Brown. She told of the Tacoma trip, in ;
which the much-wanted Mr?. Tunnell ad- :
; mitted .that Dr. Brown was footing the i
i bills, not only of.herself, but ol Miss Over
| man.
One of the strongest statements that
i have yet been made against tiie pastor is j
that of Mrs. Eaton of Oakland. She de- j
clares that on the Monday following the \
I arrest of Mrs. Davidson, Mrs. Tunnell
came to her house at 1 o'clock in the
morning very much bewildered and ap
; patently laboring under intense excite- I
ment. She said that she was going away,
j when I asked her why.
"Dr. Brown and Mattie Overman told ;
; me," she said, "if I couldn't stand up for !
! them to get out."
Dr. Brown has affidavits from all the I
lodging-house keepers on Sixth, Bryant j
j and Howard streets to the effect that he
was never there. This will be offered in ,
! rebuttal of Mrs. Davidson's statement
i alleging that he and Miss Overman were
I constant visitors to one of these places.
It is said that an attempt will be marie j
j to show that Mrs. Mary Davis is not a I
| responsible person. Mrs. Coooer is said to ;
have proof of this in her possession; but j
j declines at this time to give any intima
tion as to its character.
The council will resume its deliberations ',
at 2 o'clock to-day.
THE PROCEEDINGS.
Mrs. Davidson's Testimony In the
Police Court Re- Read Be
fore the Council.
Sensations were looked for in vain at
yesterday afternoon's session of the coun
cil. At 2 o'clock the reverend body tiled
into the lecture-room. Tne Rev. Dr. Sink
led in prayer, after which the proceedings
opened with a statement by the judee ad
vocate to the effect that Mrs. Davidson
would not testify, having been advised not
to do so by her attorneys. This being the
case, he suggested that her testimony
given in the .Police Court be read instead.
"I am much in favor of this suggestion,"
interposed Dr. Brown, "but at the same
time 1 trust that in case Mrs. Davidson's
presence is required she may be called to
testify in person."
"I am unable to speak positively as to
that matter," responded Mr. Woodhams;
"though my personal opinion is that Mrs.
Uavidson's* lawyers will not permit her to
come to the council. However, she might
I be called if it were thought necessary.' 1
"The chair would rule to that effect if
need were.' 1 remartced Dr. McLean.
Dr. Brown did not seem very well satis
lied with this information, but made no
reply. The judge advocate then com
menced reading the voluminous testimony
of Dr. Brown's aeed nemesis. Most of
tnose present, including all but four niem

bers of the council, had read the testimon- â¢!
as published in the newspapers, and a low j â¢
hum of conversation served as an accom- .
panimerit to Mr. Woouhams' clear, well- j j
modulated tones. When be had finished ! ,
a recess was ordered. . The tired judge ad- i
vocate refreshed his hard-worKed vocal i
chords by taking copious draughts of the '
brand ofale affected by our iirst father in '
paradise, while Dr. Williams fell to writ
ing in a notebook at a great rate, using -as
a knee-desk the Bible upon which the wit- :
nesses are sworn. '
Dr. Brown, as soon as the council recon
vened,, commenced the reading of Mrs. ;
Davidson's cross-examination in the Police !
Court that is, he thought he did, and the j
audience, to its great wonderment, listened â 
for about fifteen minutes to a weird, wild j '.
tale of villainy, looking to Sacramento for j
its local coloring. People were beginning to !
I think Mrs. Davidson even worse than she !
i has been painted when it transpired that, j '
> through an inadvertence of the stenog- j
rapher's clerk, the records of another case i
had been sent along with Mrs. Davidson's j
! testimony. Not wishing it to appear on j
S record that the [ancient corset-dealer had j
; conspired with a criminal in an under- !
: ground ginmill in the capital to steal a ]
i matter of $80u0. the council very consider- j
ately ordered the testimony thus read by !
mistake to be expunged from the minutes. j
The pastor then found the right place
, and resumed his reading. Mr. Woodhams
! reads well, but his work was gone through
| with in a rapid, perfunctory manner,
\ which showed that he was merely dis
charging a rather tiresome official duty.
! The audience, in fact, resigned itself to
boredom during this stage of the proceed- 'â 
ings, while even some members of the
i council actually yawned through sheer !
â  dullness.
But with Dr. Brown the reading was
i another affair. . It was a veritable treat to 'â 
I listen to the rise and fall of his sympa
] thetic voice. By turns it was sravly sar- '.
; castic, majestically grave and indignantly â¢â 
cutting. He made no comment, nor.did |
he need to make any, for his voice was j
enough. Silence reigned as he read, and j
it was nearly dinner-time before proceed
ings were "suspended until the second
session.
Mrs. Thurston was the first witness
i called at the evening session. Under di
| rect examination she made the following
j statement:
I know Dr. Brown and also Miss Overman.
, I tirst met her in the fall, I think it was of j
' i8!)4, in the Grant-avenue mission. She was
introduced to me by Mrs. Tunnell.
Our acquaintance continued until Miss Over
man departed for Tacoma, either in the fall of j
1894 or 1805. Prior to her leaving for the
! north I met Miss Overman frequently. She
came to my house, and I met her at the meet- j
I ings of Rev. '. H. Allen on Mission street. Dur- I
! ing this time she was residing with Mrs. Tun
nell, but later moved to Dr. Brown's house.
Mattie told me that the pastor had offered her
a good home, a privilege she had never enjoyed
in all lier life.
On many occasions Miss Overman told me :
, how nice and clever Dr. Brown was and how i
much she admired him. In a casual way, and i
; without actually meaning anything, 1 re
; marked :
"Be careful, Mattie. that there is nothing
I more than friendship there."
She reDlied, "Oh, Mrs. Thurston, how very i
clever you are to guess my secret."
On another occasion of a brief trip to the
I Cliff House with Dr. Brown and his wife she
said that some people did not know enough to
stay at home, she had reference to . Mrs.
Brown.
At another time Miss Overman said that one
i evening going home from church Dr. Brown
I reached back and squeezed heÂ» hand. â¢ "This
is so, Dr. Brown," Mrs. Thurston added, turn
ing to the pastor.
The reverend gentleman with a smile re
; plied "1 don't believe it."
Mattie showed me a gold watch, which she
| said had been given her by her sister. Later I
! found out that it came from Dr. Brown. Dur
i ing all these talks with Mattic Mrs. Tunnell
] was never present. She seemed to avoid dis
i cussing him in her presence.
Now, as concerns her trip to Tacoraa. She
told me that she was going as his niece. 1
j argued with her not to do this because it would
I certainly excite comment. Finally she prom
j ised not to do so and we knelt down and we
both prayed long and fervently over the mat-
I ter.
Two days later she told me that circum
stances had caused her to change her deter*
mination not to go to Tacoma with Dr. Brown.
Feeling that I had done all I could in the
â¢matter I said to her: "You thank God for It, j
Mnt tie. 1 '
Mrs. Tnnncll on the evening before leaving j
for Tacoma told me that Dr. Browu was paying ,
her expenses and also Had given her $10 for j
spending money. On Mrs. Tunnell's return \
from Tacoina Mrs. Tunnell came to me and j
spoke of Mattie Overman. She said thÃ latter
could not be comforted â she had plenty of i
clothes and all the money she wanted as she
was getting !p35 a month from some source. I
Hut still with all this she was very unhappy, j
Dr. Brown hart ruined her life and she was
miserable orer his possible acceptance of a
church in the East.
I first met Dr. Brown at the home of Mrs,
Ashby, ou Marki-t street. I called there early
rae morning anil found him there. 1 was in
troduced to Dr. Brown, but have never seen j
him until the clay 1 met him in the courtroom. '
There can be no "doubt about itâ Dr. Brown is
the man. I was surprised to see him there j
because it was so early. Mrs. Ashby had the :
appearance of baying just arisen. Miss Over- |
man looked as it' she had just come from a j
walk. I may say right here, that after Mrs. j
Tunnell left "for Tacuina 1 saw in one of the |
morning papers that she hud gone to South i
America. I thought this very strange, but
Mrs. Ashby told me that Dr. Brown had the
notice put in.
During the cross-examination by Dr.
Brown one of the most exciting events of
the entire trial occurred. The pastor
asked Mrs. Thurston if it were not true j
that she had had trouble with her bus- |
band â in fact, if she was not very jealous ;
of him :
Judge Advocateâ lt seems to me that these :
questions are entirely irrelevant, yet I do not â 
wish to appear as being opposed to them if the j
council think they. should De admitted.
Dr. Brown, laboring under intense ex
citement, rose and said:
It feems to me that every time an objection
Is made it is to some question asked by myself
to the witnesses. The prosecution is allowed j
all the latitude it wishes, yet I am restricted
to the questions which 1 am permitted to ask. \
1 warn to say right here that I think the
moderator has been extremely unfair to me, I
not only as regards this particular case, but in j
others.
Moderator â Does Dr. Drown mean to iDsinu
ate that this council, or the moderator, is in
any way biased or prejudiced against him?
Dr. Brown â I insinuate nothing, except that
the moderator has been unfair. I could protest
and did juotest against. tnÂ« meeting of the
council prior to the date in the letters-missive.
A secret meeting was held, of which I had no
knowledge, except through a Call reporter.
Just what occurred there 1 do not know, except
what was told me at the opening session of the
council. I objected then and object now to
their fixing the line of procedure.
Moderator â Dr. Brown has made serious
charges against this councillund I demand that
! we go into executive session to determine what
foundation there is in them
A long discussion followed, participated
| in by the members of the council. The
moderator was sustained in the position he
had assumed in calling for an investiga-
I tion, but the full text and final result of
this interesting episode is told in the
stenographic reports, as follows:
Moderatorâ l wish, in addition to the notice
I have given of the motion, to say that I hope
I there will be a thorough investigation of the re
; marks of Dr. Brown. I suppose I have the
i same right to speak, after asking the assistant
j moderator to take the chair, that any other
person has. I also said that, in my opinion, a
very small part of the significance of the in
: vesogation was in what was said by Mrs.
J Stockton, and that the critical part was yet to
come. I knew that the evidence given by her I
was of very little Importance, and contend j
that I have the right to speak as I did i
as a member of this council. Notwilh- I
standing that we had adopted a rule, wen
have the right to change the rule, and no one
knows that better than Dr. Brownâ that Con
gregationalism is flexible. He ought to know
tha f . we do not adoiit rules in order to be hin
dered. He knows also that he hus asked us to
suspend judgment and that the investigation
should be made. lie wanted the matter inves
tigated thoroughly and so that it might not be
misunderstood I deem it most important thr.t
the most searching examination shall be given
the remaining part of the investigation. I
think that will not be rude and insulting. We
are here to know the truth.
Dr. Williamsâ l move that this matter of
difference of opinion between the moderator
ami Dr. Brown shall be committed to a com
mittee oi three, all of whom shall be members
of this council, and that the committee at the
close of this session convene in the library, if
that motion prevails I shall then be prepared
to make a motion that we proceed with the ex
amination of tnis wines*.
Tenneyâ l should like to ask how that com
mittee is to be appointed. I would suggest
that one member be appointed by the mod
erator, one by Dr. Brown and one by the coun
cil itself.
Dr. Williamsâ l am satisfied.
The Moderatorâ l would ask the assistant
moderator to take the chair for a few mo
ments. (The assistant moderator takes the
chair.) l wish to move .an amendment or that
some one would. It is not a difference of
opinion between Dr. Brown and myself. It is
explicit charges brought by Dr. Brown that he
has not been fairly treated by the moderator
mid the council. Dr. Brown declares that in
his judgment he hns not received .'air treat
ment. I think thnt your motion ought to call
for an investigation of these charges.
Dodgeâ l mink that we JtUt decided this
question. We can't vote over again on it â
whether we sustain the moderator or not.
E. C. Williamsâ This council was called to
convene and investigate Dr. Brown. We are
not here to investigate charges made by Dr.
Brown against this council. [Murmurs of ap
proval.]
Raderâ Dr. Brown is not on trial. He is sim
ply a witness. It seems to me, with all defer
ence to our moderator, tnat more significance
is attached to this matter than there ought to
be. I don't mean for one moment to reflect
upon Dr. McLean's contention.
McLeanâ l think that the integrity of the
investigating body is impugned and that it
should be removed. If it is dealing unfairly
with Dr. Brown that should be discovered. We
cannot afford to go on with tn investigation so
important as this, which all the Congrega
tional churches, all the churches of the United
States are watchiiiÃ with deep and painful In
terest, with such an imputation renting on the
council. The council ought to be like the repu
tation of the maiden, above suspicion, and
every shadow of unfairness ought to be re
pri'liated.
Freemanâ We are thecourt of last resort and
should take no notice of this matter, i don't
see how we can make the investigation the
doctor asks for. I think we should stand upon
our right and let the imputations be whatever
they may be.
Pondâ l think our brother from Sacramento
has suggested the solution of this question.
By a unanimous vote we have upheld ou_
moderator. I move that this council sees n
occasion for any impugnment to be made.
CScudderâ l hope this motion will not carry.
We are here in the interest of conciliation as
much as anything else. If after this investiga
tion of. Dr. Brown it is shown that in that re
mark to this council he has been mistaken,
and I think that it can be shown, everything
will be harmonious. I think that the simplest
thing to do is to meet this charge in a concilia
tory spirit.
Tenneyâ l shall support the motion in refer
ence to a committee. Ido not thin* that we
must stop for a moment here and think of the
tremendous strain Dr. Brown is under; we
must remember the seriousness of these
charges that have been made, and we must â
irv in some way or other to get at the facts
that come up as to Dr. Brown that will show f
us the position we are in. We shall lose
nothing by this attempt to make peace. Let f
us do it in the interest of the brother, in
the interest of the church and in the in- /
terest of everybody.
Freemanâ l do not see any way in which the (
committee of three can throw any light on the
matter. Let us retire and see if we cannot {
come to some determination.
Parkinsonâ Dr. Brown has not charged this /
council, but only the moderator. We have
voted to sustain the moderator and we have (
nothing to investigate. While it may have
been in bad tnste for Dr. Brown to have made /
this charge I don't think that we have any
thing to investigate. . (
Tenneyâ Let us remember that our modera
tor has asked for this. (
McLeanâ f don't ask for it on my account.
The integrity of the council has been called (
into question. If it is only that my own atti
tude has been impugned I don't wish it. It (
seems to me that the integrity of this council
as an investigating body has been injured. It (
seems to me that it might be well for this
council to take a session with Dr. Brown, and (
let him show us where we are wrong.
Tcuneyâ lstiil plead that we do not act here (
I on this matter. >Vc ought to talK this matter
| over with Dr. Brown, and look it over in all its (
aspects. If we can slrow that he is in error, I
am sure he will take it back. (
On a vote being taken on a motion to c
table the whole matter it was carried, c
and the announcement of the moderator, c
who at this point resumed the chair, Â«
that the council would go on with the '
trial was received by the crowded audience Â£
with murmurs of relief and approval. c
Owing to the time lost in this debate the c
session was extended till 10 p. m., half an c
hour beyond the time fixed. ;
While the motion on the extension was *
pending Dr. Brown took the floor and {
spoke as follows: "If I were allowed the c
opportunity to state in a few words <
wherein 1 think that private meeting did <
me injustice â " â¢
He was interrupted by Dr. Mooar, who *
said: "This is out of order. Dr. Brown t
occupies too much time in debating ques- ! ,
tions. We want to give him all the op- j t
portunity possible in the examination of
this witness, but we do not want to have
aur time taken up by long debates."
Brown attempted to go on, but was
forced to take his seat by the failure of the
moderator to recognize him. After re
maining quiet for a moment only, how
ever, he arose again and said: â 
"Mr. Moderator, I am not sure that I want to
Â£0 on with this council after the manifestation
af its spirit here to-night, and particularly the
manifestation of your spirit."
The moderatorâ lt is for Dr. Brown to decide.
Dodge â Go on.
Teuneyâ May I put in -another plea?
The moderator â If the doctor wishesâ
Kaderâ l move that we adjourn.
Dr. Williamsâ l rise to a question o* privi
lege. I have been called away to Calaveras
County to attend a funeral and must leave to
morrow. I shall probably not get back before
Saturday. I make this explanation that the
council and others may know why I am ab
sent.
Mrs. Thurston being asked if she pre
ferred to go on then or appear again, she
stated emphatically that she wanted to
finish her testimony then as she had al
ready appeared six or seven times before
the council in the expectation of being
called. The motion to adjourn was with
drawn ana Dr. Brown continued bis cross
exumination of the witness, showing that
she hud no personal knowledge of what
she testified to. He also tried to show
that her answers on direct examination
were in a measure biased by her dislike of
regular ministers of the gospel, and
showed some slight discrepancies in ber
direct statements.
Mrs. Stockton was called for cross
examination, but she was not present.
Mrs. George Barton was then called, but
she, too, was absent. The committee ap
pointed to secure a statement from Mrs.
Eaton, to whose house Mrs. Tunnell is said
to have gone the night she left Dr. Brown's
house, then made the report, stating that
Mrs. Eaton, her niece and her mother
were found to be intelligent and frank
witnesses. Their testimony was then read
by the secretary of the committee as fol
lows:
Testimony of Mrs. Elizabeth Jane Eaton be
fore special committee appointed by council.
Mrs. Eaton, being duly Bworn, testified as fol
lows:
I have known Mrs. Tunnell about thirty
years. She has visited here frequently. Her
last visit was on the early morning of Decem
ber 30, 1895. Previous to this she had been
over to my brother-in-law's funeral, December
12, and remained about a week. She left on
Thursday. Before she went to Tacoma she
called durinsr the month of March. I have not
talked with Mrs. Tunnell about Dr. Brown's
relations with Miss Overman except what ap
peared in the papers. Mrs. Tunnell made no
confident of me. She did not tell me where
she was going when she went away. She left
here some time in March with the intention of
going to Tacoma on the next steamer. 6he
said the object of her visit was the spiritual
good of the Overman family. I don't know
how soon she left for Tacoma after leaving my
house, but think that it wag on the next steam
er, ."he told me she had an income from her
brother-in-law up to July, 1894, after which he
didn't send her any. The reason she came to
my house was due to her financial need. She
made her home with us here. Mrs. Ashby, her
sister, paid her wav to Tacoma. She received
a message from Dr. Brown before leaving. Dr.
Brown came here and I admitted him to the
house, and he Inquired for Mrs. Tunnell.
Mrs. Tunnell came out, and said Dr. Brown
asked her if I was Mrs. Eaton. Before Mrs.
Tunnell left for Tacoma he paid her a second
visit (Mr. Brown's first visit was in the early
part of February, the second visit in March)
and the reason given was, to see why she, Mrs.
Tunnell, did not go over to see him. I did not
sec Dr. Brown at that time. The night before
she left a messenger boy came to the house
with an envelope that bore Dr. Brown's ad
dress. It was a special-delivery letter. That
was the night betore she left for Tacoma. I
think she left for Tacoma on Friday. She did
not state the contents of the message. I have
no idea whatever of its contents. She left the
house the next day and told me she was going
to Tacoma. Sirs. Ashby came here and took
dinner before she left. Won't say how long be
fore the departure of Mrs. Tunnell for Ta
coma. Mrs. Tunnell came the day before
Christmas to make her home with us. On her
return from Tacoma she visited me and stayed
a month or six weeks, probably the last of May
of 1895. I am not sure, but think she was
absent thres months. I don't know how
soon after her return she visited me. She re
ported that all the Overman family were sick
with the grip in Tacoma, and said that she
herself had had the grip. She said they (re
ferring to the Overman family) reminded ncr
ot a hospital. She did not make a confident
of me. She had nothing to say about the news
paper reports. She told me, however, that she
thought Dr. Brown was an innocent man and
said she was going away to get rid of testifying.
After her return from Tacoma she stayed about
six weeks with me and left for the City
about July 22. I distinctly remember
that she was here on the Fourth of July.
She remained with me about six weeks on her
return. After returning to the City she came
over occasionally to see me.' The last time she
came on Monday morning early, and she said
she came from Dr. Brown's house. We were
very much surprised to see her at that time of
night, and I said, "Where have you been?"
and she said, "I have just come over from the
City. Haven't you seen the newspapersâ
haven't you seen the blackmailing scheme
with Mrs. Davidson? I just missed the 11
o'clock boat. " She seemed to be bewildered
and didn't know what boat she did take. Mr.
Eaton let her in. She knocked on the window
in order to get us up. Bhe gave as ncr reason
for this midnight journey the fact that she
wished to escape being called upon as a wit
ness in the Davidson-Brown affair, which bad
been published in the San Francisco newspa
pers. She did not say where she was going. I
said, "Why are you going away?" She said,
"Dr. Brown and Mattie Overman told me if I
couldn't stand right up for them to get out."
I said, "You are his best witness." I can prove
the remark that Mrs. Tunnell made about Dr.
Brown end Miss Overman advising Mrs. Tun
' nell to leave by my niece, who is now in the
house. She did not tell the manner of her de
parture from San Francisco that night. She
didn't say she couldn't itand up for Dr. Brown.
She did not tell me that Dr. Brown knew she
was coming here. She remained from 20 min
utes after 1 o'clock until 9 o'clock Wednesday
morning. when. she said she was
going to the Sixteenth-street station.
I saw no money about her except
four bits. Before she left she talked about the
newspaper reports and denied some things
Mrs. Davidson had said'among; others Mrs.
Davidson's account of Miss Overman's sick
ness. She again said she thought Dr. Brown
was innocent. She is a very timid woman, a
fanatic on religion and always has been pecu
liar, and nas been in the habit of making jour
neys where her friends could not find her. She
knew there was a great strain ahead of her and
wished to escape the notoriety it would briug.
I know Miss Overman. She was here one night,
but not a word was said concerning these rela
tions with Dr. Brown. Never heard anything
from her upon the subject. She called here
twice during the summer of ,1804. Came first
with Mrs. Tunnell. She called in Jnlv <>f IH'.U
before. Bhe went to Dr. Brown's house. She
was then stopping with Mrs. Tunnell at the
Webb House.
Concerning Misa Overman Mrs. Eaton further

The silver Senators are wrong; in de

There is one thing on which we can all

Sherman was right in saying "the peo

As it appears the Spaniards do not send

"If you wish to bring the name of Eng

An issue of bonds to the amount of

THE TAKIFF DEBATE.
The vote on the emergency tariff bill in
the Senate on Tuesday, taken in connec
tion with the discussion which followed,
may be regarded as an assurance that the
measure is virtually dead. It would be a
mistake, however, to assume that we are
to have no tariff bill at all at this session.
On the contrary, it would seem from the
course of the debate that it is yet possible
for an agreement to be reached in favor of
a bill that would give more protection than
the one which has been rejucted.
It is well known that several of the West
ern Republican .senators objected to the
House bill because it afforded no protec
tion whatever to sugar or to wool. More
over, some of them did not believe that
the measure was seriously intended even
;by its supporters. Iv fact, Senator Teller
is reported as saying in the ronrse of the
debate: "There is a motion made by the
Senator from Montana to recommit this
bill for defects which everybody who has
read and examined it concedes. I charge
here, and shall undertake to make the
charge good, that this bill was never in
troduced here nor has it been supported
here with any reference to its becoming a
Jaw."
The statement of the Senator from Colo
rado was virtually conceded by Senator
Sherman, who said: "The other House
having sent us ever so faulty a bill, lot us
take it up, and if it is not risjht let us
make it right and send it back to the
House, and we will have a ready concur
rence." On this showing there seems no
reason why some agreement should not be
reached and a bill devised that would
yield an ample revenue for the Govern
ment and at the same time afford some
degree of protection to those industries
that now languish for the lack of it.
The probability of such a result is in
creased by the tenor of t lie discussion yes
terday. Sonat or Allen's strange offer of
six Populist votes for the tariff provided a
promise was given for a free-coinage bill
will, of course, amount to nothing. Sena
tor Carter's speech, however, in favor of
an amended tariff is decidedly encourag
ing and gives reason for believing that a
more thorougnly protective bill would find
stronger support than the House emer
gency bill.
The probabilitj* that Cleveland would
veto such a bill should not be allowed in
any way to interfere with its passage. In
answer to Peffer's statement, "The Presi
dent asserts we do not need any more
revenue," Sherman said: "I do not care
what the President says. Every man
within the sound of my voice knows that
we need more revenue." The spirit of
these words is that upon which all Repub
licans in the Senate should act. The otir
rent deliciency already exceeds $20,000,000,
and at the same ratio of increase the total
amount for the fiscal year will be fully
$30,000,000. This is the condition that con
fronts the country, and Congress owes it
to the people to provide a revenue suffi
cient for the needs of the Government,
leaving it to the Democratic President to
reject it if he dares.
EOAD LEGISLATION.
The most important matter to be con
sidered by the good-roads meeting soon to
be held in this City will be the bills pro
posed to the State Legislature by the
Bureau of Highways as the result of its
thorough study of roadmaking in general
arÂ»d the condition and needs of California
in particular. Until Commissioner Maude
made his addref s recently before the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce we had
not observed that he had given any hint
of the legislation which the bureau may
propose. Now that he has done this it is
well that his ideas should be thoroughly
known and fully considered.
For general purposes he seems to favor
the Massachusetts plan. This makes
three classes â State highway?, connecting
principal cities; district roads and town
roads. He seems inclined, however, judg
ing from' further intimations which he
gave, to modify that plan to suit the con
ditions pecuyar to California. Thus he
would have a State highway starting at
Yreka and running through Redding,
Sacramento, the San Joaquin Valley,
Tejon Pass and Los Angelea to San Ber
nardino; another starting at San Fran
cisco and running through San Jose, the
Salinas Valley ami Santa Barbara to San
Diego, and eight east-and-we.Â«t roads
across the State on routes not mentioned.
He says thai feeders for all these should
be built by the counties. Of course this
work is not to be done all at once, but
something is to be accomplished each
year.
This is the general pian. If a better can
be devised it should be presented to the
approaching convention, at which dele
gates from all parts of the State and repre
sentatives of all interests directly con
cerned . with good roads will be present.
Of course the construction of State roads
by general taxation wiil require the cities
to bear the greater part of the expense, as
three-fourtha of the assessed valuation of
property lies within the cities. As the
cities are all in need of better streets and
are heavily taxed for the purpose this
proposition is a serious one. At the same
time it is true that the welfare of the cities
is dependent on the prosperity of the
country, and that the country is now
drained annually to the extent of $4,000,000
for road work.
At the 3ame time, by reason of the fact
that the roads are still bad and thoroughly
inadequate, the country could save 40 per
cent of the present cost of wagon-hauling
if good roads were made, and this means
to say that In addition to the $4,000,000 a
I year which the interior is expending on
roads it is submitting to a drain of $39,000,
--000 a year by reason of its bad roads.
Against the certainty of an increase of
municipal taxes for country road construc
tion is the assurance of an increased gen
eral prosperity as the result of that taxa
tion. The subject is too elaborate to be
discussed fully in a few words, and hence it
should be thoroughly studied before the
good-roads meeting is held.
THE SEAL FISHERIES.
By a unanimous vote tne House of Rep
resentatives has passed the Dingley bill
relatineto the fur seal industry, and it is
probable therefore that there will be suili
cient strength to t>ass it in the Senate.
The bill is a peculiar one, and deals with
the seal fisheries in a most radical way.
It directs the President to enter into ne
gotiations with the governments of Great
Britain. Russia and Japan for the purpose
of agreeing upon a plan of protecting the
fisheries in accordance with the findings of
the Paris tribunal, and provides that if
this agreement be not concluded in time
to govern the season of 1896 the Secretary
of the Treasury shall have every seal on
the Pribyloff Islands killed and sell the
skins for the benefit of the treasury.
The bill, it will be Been, calls for a thor
ough protection of the fisheries or a com
plete extermination of the seals. The
alternative seems like one of wanton de
struction, and yet is really a well-consid
ered act of legislation. The present ar
rangement for the protection of the seals
is a farce, and a very costly one at that.
It affords really no protection at all, for the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 27. 1896.
killing of seals in the open sea includes so
many females that the young on the
islands die by the thousands of starvation,
and the fisheries in this way are in a pro
cess of slow and cruel extinction.
According to the reports of American
officials there were found on the islands
last season over 28,000 seal pups which
had died of starvation, their mothers hav
ing been killed at sea while in search of
food beyond the sixty-mile zone. This
means of course that the herd wili be
eventually exterminated if present condi
tions continue. The necessity of the al
ternative of the Dirmley bill is therefore
apparent. Either all the nations inter
ested in sealing and bordering on the
JSorth Pacific Ocean must unite to prevent
not only poaching on the Pribyloff Islands
but pelagic sealing as well, or else our
Government should exterminate the herd
at once, thus putting an end to the cruelty
of leaving the young to starve, and at the
same time saving the Government the ex
pense of a costly, troublesome and useless
patrol of Behring Sea.
AN INSTRUCTIVE PAKABLE.
The Los Angeles Investor, an exception
ally able paper, devoted to financial mat
ter*, publishes an ingenious statement of
the affairs ol a certain great corporation.
The concern, whose assets run to $48,000,
--000, called an election of a board of direc
tors in 18!)4, and as it did an enormous
business and employed a large number of
persons to manage its affairs there was a
strong inducement to secure its positions
of trust and profit. As there were many
thonsands of shareholders, each having a
private business of his own separate from
that of the corporation in which he was
interested, the most of these failed to give
proper attention to the election of a board
of directors. As a consequence a number
of unscrupulous manipulators formed an
organization to secure control of the direc
tory, and of the hundreds of the lucrative
positions which were under their control.
Their machinations, thanks to the lack
of organization among the decent and in
telligent shareholders, were successful;
the corrupt ring elected a majority of the
board. These men, it may well be taken
for granted, were utterly unlit for the great
trust which they had secured. Both in
character and ability they came from the
lower strata of humanity and would be as
ready to blunder through sheer stupidity
and incapacity as to plunder the assets of
the corporation and levy burdensome as
sessments on the shareholders. Our con
temporar\r then goes on to give figures
showing how the trust has been shame
fully mismanaged, and winds up by declar
ing that the corporation in question was
the city of Los^Vngeles.
That tfl a graphic way of stating a com
mon evil. It is just such occurrences as
these that make heedless citizens disgusted
with politics in municipal affairs; but it
will be evident to intelligent persons that
the fault lies not with politics itself, but
with the neglect of politics. Nothing
could be clearer, say, than the fact that if
the large majority of the Republican
party in favor of a clean, able government
for San Francisco would properly dis
charge their political duty there would
never be any scandalous organizations
known as "solid eights," no disgraceful
street work by incompetent or dishonest
street departments; in short, there would
be none of the evils which flow from
organizations effected by corrupt political
bosses and flourishing on the apathy of
the people.
All so-called "independent," "non
partisan" or "citizens" parties are clearly
just as much political organizations as
those of older parties, and are just as liable
to the manipulation of corrupt bosses as
any other. Sometimes they are the direct
creation of bosses for the purpose of de
feating a strong regular party that is de
termined to secure decent government.
It Is easier to rescue the machinery of a
party from corrupt management than to
found a separate organization.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Samuel Longabaugh, proprietor of a store at
Empire, Nev., and for thirty-four years a
resident of the Carson River Valley, is at the
Russ. He formerly brought large quantities
of wood down the river from Alpine County,
Cal., and marketed it at Carson, Virginia City,
Gold Hill and other places.
The Virginia and Truckee Railroad, how
ever, he says, discriminated against him and
he had to discontinue it. The road charged
him $3 25 a cord from Empire to Virginia
City, a distance of seventeen miles, and $3 35
from Carson to Virginia City. The road re
bated other shippers, however, and gave them
about $2 a cord the advantage. He hates rail
road monopolies and uses picturesque lan
guage in reference to them.

"What Nevada ought to do is to send more
of her products to outside places. The reason
she doesn't is that the freight la too high.! We

potatoes and apples. We have the best beef,
butter and apples in the world.
"There has been almost no snow in Nevada
this year, and cattle arc in fine condition. No

a lot of hay left over that the stock couldn't

He"is down on a goods-buying trip, and for a
change of scene.
Miss Rena Atkinson, the leading lady of the
Carleton Opera Company, now playing here, is
a Portland (Or.) girl, and Mr. Carleton takes
great pride in her and her attainments. â¢
At the recent reception at the Press Club, at
which Miss Atkinson, as well as Mr. Carleton,
appeared and sang, the latter stated that he

had discovered her. The lady has had many
curious experiences. East as well as West, and
also in Europe, but naturally she is much at
tached to her old home in Oregon.-
Her mother was one of the brave little band
of New England women who made the long
trip from New York City around the Horn a
shun time after the close of the Civil War on
the Continental, o( which her brother, A. B.
Mercer, was the owner.
She settled in Portland and there married
John F. Atkinson, a printer by trade.
About 1872 Rena Atkinson, the young
woman who is now the prima donna of the
Carleton Opera Company, was born. As a
mere child she displayed natural musical
ability, and her parents did everything in their
power to encourage her. She had a very sweet
soprano voice, and used it well. It is not hard
to see how she became bound up in the never
failing love of music. Her surroundings were
musical, music pervaded the household and
every effort was subject to close and scholarly
criticism. Unfortunately her father met with
business reverses, and so the family moved to
Denver. In that city Rena attracted atten
tion in music, and through kindly influences
was given many advantages.
' It finally became evident that she would
probably make a mark in her chosen sphere;
so about four years ago her father moved to
New York City, where she was given every
possible advantage under the most skillful
vocal instructors. She has sung such roles in
grand opera as ''Marguerite," "Mignon," "La
Traviata," "Gioconda," and others all calling
for artistic treatment and special vocal ability,
and has achieved distinct success in each
opera, and received warm praise. Her voice is
sweet, mellow and pure. Miss Atkinson sings
with delightfnl ease. It is greatly in her favor
that at the outset she avoids artificial methods
ol expression. She vocalizes not only grace
fully, but naturally.
Her debut in the operatic profession was
brought about by W: T. Carleton, whose atten
tion was directed to her by John Maguire,
years ago manager of the old California Thea
ter and afterward the pioneer manager of
Montana, he having known the Atkinsons in
Portland. Mr. Maguire's death, It will be re
membered, recently occurred. Carleton at
once heard her sing and immediately engaged
her to sing in a series of operatic perform
ances, and gave her the advantage of his long
md varied experience in the best school* ol
the "bel canto," and al* closely watched her
histrionic development. This is Miss Atkin
son's third season with Mr. Carleton, and her
steady and continued success is a source of
great gratification to him.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Bennett of the London Musical Times is turn
ing his attention to ridiculing the prevailing
styles of musical criticism. The following is
what he calls "the indiscriminately eulo
gistic" : "The initial itemâ a whistling quartet
by the siffleurs Parisiansâ left nothing to be
desired on the score of purity of expression,
penetration of tone and unanimity of en
semble. After five recalls these talented
artists gratified the audience with another ex
quisite exhibition of their 6ibilatory powers,
the piece being an arrangement as a four-part
song of the familiar 'Aye Maria' of Bach-
Gounod. Mme. Claudia Popkins, who fol
lowed with Tarlc-y Biudells' pathetic ballad,
'Only an Oyster-catcher,' is a prime favorite
with the audience, and seldom, if ever, has
her luscious portamento been displayed to
greater advantage than in the realistic refrain
of this delicious ditty. Here again the demand
for an encore was imperative, and Mme. I'op
kins graciously responded with the 'Lonely
Limpet,' in which the sorrows of the isolated
crustacean are so tenderly depicted in the
lyric of Leonard Potere, and the melody of
Beppo Francatelli. The appearance of the
veteran tragedian, Mr. Storn-Barmer, who had
been especially engaged for this occasion to !
recite 'Three Blind Mice,' was the signal for j
a wild outburst of enthusiasm lasting for sev- !
eral minutes. The simple charm of this classic i
morceau was admirably brought out by Mr.
Storn-Barmer's refined enunciation, and as the .
audience, like the voracious Oliver, clamored
for more, the talented artist good-naturedly
gave, with wonderful eflect, the whole of the
first book of the 'Paradise Lost.' "
Bennett continues nis satire by Faying: "At
the close of this most impressive performance,
which only occupied tnree-qarters of an hour,
agreeable relief was afforded by the gratuitous
distribution of a choice assortment of superb
sandwiches, thoughtfully provided by the gen
erous impresario, after which the enormous
audience, like giants refreshed, turned their
attention to Master Philidor Chantileer's elec
trifying rendering of the new patriotic song,
â¢Who Dares to Twist the Lion's Tail?" Master
Chantileer, who wore the uniform. of a field
marshal and employed one of the new megalo
phonic vocal cord expanders recently invented
by Mr. Edison, excited the most unbridled
enthusiasm among his auditors, and after a
double encore sent the house into fresh
paroxysms of patriotic ecstacy by the clever
performance of a hornpipe, to the accompani
ment of the pipers of the mounted Marines.
Some graceful feats of coujuring by Professor
Trecardi, pianoforte solos by Maxim Krupp, a
short sermon by Dr. Barker (to which the ver
satile divine added a performance on the
flying trapeze by way of an encore), and some
sensational headers from the organ loft into a
tank on the edge of the platform by Miss
Godiva Plunger brought the programme to a
close at a few minutes past 12 o'clock."
This is an example of the Sartorial style of
musical criticism: "You will, I am sure, be \
dying to hear about the dresses worn at the
'Creation' â the oratorio, I mean â which was
given by the Sacred Philharmonic Society at
the Mendelssohn Hall last night. Alpetti's
dress was a perfect dream of delight. Just
fancy! The bodice of crushed cape gooseberry
satin, veiled in accordion-pleated chiffonâ so
appropriate to a musicianâ of an Ksterhazy
browa tint; you know, of course, that dear old
Haydn was music-master or something or
other to one of the Esterhazys in the fifteenth
centuryâ or was it the seventeenth? The skirt
was of very bright pink satin, with a hem of
silver and silver bands around the bodice, and
at the back of the waiEt two chou bows of
earthquake-blue satin gave the whole thing
ineffable chic. Miss Hilda Butson, the con
tralto, was gowned in electric-plum velvet,
with salmon-colored tabs across tne shoulder.
I was rather surprised to notice that Edward
Davis, the tenor, only wore two diamond studs
in his enameled shirt front; but I am told that
it renders the production of his high A's moro
easy. I had so much to do in memorizing the
dresses and nodding to my friends that I really
had no time to listen to the music, which was
of course played and sung to perfection.
"P- S.â On looking casually at my programme
I find there is no contralto in the 'Creation,'
so I must have seen Miss Buison somewhere
else."
Seidl and his orchestra have arranged to pay

great an attraction In the East this winter as
it did on his three previous visits. He has
been playing principally at the Philharmonic
Orchestra concerts, and his performances have
exercised as emotional an influence as Anton
Seidl's conducting has done. Sauret, who
claims that his repertory consists of 438 com
positions, was brought to this country by the
manager who directed Ysaye's tour last season.
The jubilee performance of the Carr-Beel
Saturday performance will take place on Sat
urday next. A number of society ladies feel
that some appreciation is due to the artists for
all that they have accomplished in the cause
of music in this City. They state that the Carr-
Beel concerts Tiave fostered a taste for classical
chamber" music and have introduced to the
San Francisco public many new compositions
that otherwise would have been hitherto un
heard here. In token ot appreciation it is
proposed that the subscribers and other
patrons hold an Informal reception after the
concert, in the parlors of Golden Gate Hall, to
greet Mrs. Carr and her fellow-artists and ex
presa appreciation of the promotion of musical
interests in this community. The ladies who
have the reception in charge are Mrs. Charles

The Liszt Museum at Weimar has just re
ceived an interesting present from a member
of the great musician's family. It is the plas
ter cast of Liszt's right hand, made October
22, 1874, on the occasion of his sixty-third
anniversary. The modeling shows the extra
ordinary development of the artisl's hand,
j which far surpassed ordinary proportions.
This marvelous hand and the extraordinary
force of the muscles of the arm, accustomed to
pianoforte exercise from earliest infancy,
formed the foundation of Liszt's marvelous
{ playing from the mechanical point of view,

i genius to make use of the remarkable instru
ment with which nature had endowed him.

that the theater shall give two popular per-
I formances entirely gratis during the course of

that an English composer, Reginald Statham,

words of these patriotic songs of. the Boers,

translated them into Dutch.
The little castle of Fancy, near Bayreuth,

THE COST OF THE CUBAN WAR.
Figures showing the cost to Spain of the
Cuban Insurrection are given by a London
newspaper, and they are certainly startling.
The Government borrowed $10,000,000 last
year from the Bank of Spain to be used in sup
pressing the revolt, and that sum was all ex
pended in three months. English capitalists
were next asked to extend their aid, but it is
not known what was the result of the applica
tion. A short time ago the Bank of Spain was
asked to make a second loan and another $10,
--000.000 was secured on Cuban bonds, but the
bank intimated that its accommodations would
go no further.
It is estimated that apart from the destruc
tion of property in Cuba the cost of the war to
Spain up to the close of 1895 was SjseO.OOO.OOO.
Now funds for local use are proposed to be
obtained by the Spanish Bank of Cuba issuing
currency to the extent of $24,000,000, and
tnat institution's deposits of coin are to be rt
enforced by demands upon Cuban capitalists
by ('amain-General Wevier. The financial
situation seems to be equally as desperate as
is the military situation.
NANSEN AND THE NORTH POLE.
According to our cable dispatches Russian
geographers and Arctic explorers agree that
the probabilities are greatly in favor of Dr.
Nansen having been successful in his quest if
the North Pole. The vice-president of the fet.
Petersburg Geographical Society, Senator
SemenorT, indorses the views expressed by
Baron Toll that the Norwegian explorer is now
at one or other of the New Siberian Islands,
where provision depots were established for
his use in case he returned by that route. The
Russian trader and mammoth ivory hunter
who first brought the Nansen rumors to the
Siberian coast is well known, and Senator ;
Semenof! holds the view that he has met a â¢
member of the Xansen party or the Norwegian I

It is, of course, impossible to say whether,
Ivansen is returning in the Fram or by sled.
But the probabilities are that he is returning.
In contrast to the discussions of the Russian
geographers about Nansen, the adverse criti
cisms of our own Arctic heroes and authorities
have been, in wretched taste. They have de
nied everything from the start, refusing to dis
cuss even the possibility of Nansen's success.
This is, of course, an absurd course to take,
and certainly not creditable to the scientific

CATHODE RAY IS
WHAT IT IS NOT
What Prof. Le Conte Has
to Say About Roent
gen's Discovery.
AS APPLIED TO SURGERY
If It Should Have No Other
Uses It Would Still Be
Invaluable.
EXPERIMENTS AT BERKELEY.
An Interview With the Famous Sci
entist on His Seventy-Third
Birthday.
Dr. Wibon, professor of physics at the
State University, is busily engaged in ex
perimenting with Koentgen's mysterious
ray, but so far he has secured no results to i
speak of. He says the reason is that the {
university has not got the proper appa
ratus for successfully carrying through the
experiments, which calls for a larger in
duction coil. However, he intends to
keep at i^until he does get something. E.
R. Drew and W. J. Raymond, instructors
in physics, and also E. R. Jackson and
others of the students are at work with the
new ray; all handicapped, however, with
insufficient apparatus.
Dr. Lewis is in receipt of a communica
tion from Professor Roentgen explaining
his experiments and his theory of the
cause of the new ray, and is himself pre
paring a paper on the subject.
All the professors at Berkeley are, of
course, very much interested ia the sub
ject.
Professor Le Conte, speakieg of the dis
covery, said: "This is new. We have only
the most meager reports â that is to say
there has not been much done; there has
not been time for much experimenting as !
yet. What there is, however, is remark- |
able and valuable. It is a distinct ex- |
tension of scientific knowledge, and every I
such extension presents infinite possibilf- i
tics of its application. So far as we have ;
seen the one* practical application of this
discovery is to surgery. The value of it in
that application, however, can scarcely be
overestimated. If the flesh of the hand is
invisible to these rays, and only the bones
or other like dense matter absorbs them, i
then to a stronger application the flesh of
the whole body mar reasonably be ex- ,
pected to be so. So that it is reasonable
to believe that the shadow of a man's
skeleton â a living man of flesh and blood ]
â may be secured. Therefore, as Pro
fessor Davidson has said to The Call, if
this discovery had been made prior to the j
shooting of Garneld, the ball, about which
there was so much doubt, couid have been ,
quickly located and extracted.
"If Professor Koentgen's discovery ia I
found finally to have no other application
than this to surgery it is a great addition
to science. But it will have others; that is
almost certain. The whole scientific world
of physicists is at work with this new
vibration. It has given a new vantage
around from which to work and a new iru- !
nulee to work with, and results may be
looked for every day. it is a great pity that
the Stata University is not equipped "as it
should be in its department of physics. !
The equipment in other departments is
first clas?, but in physics we are notably
weak.
' There is a considerable difference of
opinion as to just wh:u the new ray is.
Roentgen thinks it originates at tne point i
where the cathode ray from within im
pinges unon the glass tube,*and that it is
a direct ray, as distinct from the vibrating
ray of light. There is, as I say, much
difference of opinion on that matter.
Some think it the ultra red ray â the very
long ray.
"It has long been known that rays of i
light, as they may be called, of very, very !
loÂ»v temperature pass through everything.
Everything is tranparent to it. Raoul
Pictet made some very pretty experiments :
in this direction, upon which I hart it in
mind at one time to prepare a paper, but
other things intervened, I lost inter
est and the matter dropped. But he
secured temperatures of 100 and 150 j
degrees below zero. At that temperature
the rays are very long and pass through
any amount of clothes, flesh or anything j
else. Everything, as I say, is transparent
at such a temperature. As the tempera- [
ture rises tht> vibrations shorten until the i
ultra red, red and the visible light, and i
on up to violet and the ultra vrolet. Some
scientists are of the opinion that the X
ray of Roentgen may be the ultra-red ray.
It is not at all improbable that some
substance may be discovered that will
reflect and focalize it. and new applica- |
tions develop infinitely."
"But, by the way," said tbe professor in j
conclusion, "it may be well to call atten- |
tion again to the fact that it is not a ca- :
â¦ bode ray. Cathode rays are not new, and I
Roentgen's recent communication on the j
subject was employed in explaining that i
this was not a cathode ray, but something j
entirely different, which it certainly is."
Professor Le Conte was shown The Call !
of yesterday, containing: the report, tanen i
from the Isew York Herald, of Professor I
Simon's experiment of photographing his
own brain. He read the account and '
studied the reproduction of the photo
graph very seriously, and then said:
"If Professor Simon or anybody else has
done this thing it is, of course, of great '
moment. But I shall wait until I get it '
from some authoritative scientific source
before I stiail credit it. To be sure, we
cannot afford to ignore a thing simply be
cause we cannot understand it. The
things that look most impossible are often I
so because of our ignorance of their cause.
When we come to know about them they
are very simple. On the other hand, the
things which science knows to be impossi
ble â such as perpetual motion â many peo
ple deem to be auite possible, and so
waste their lives in fruitless endeavors to
solve it."
QUESTION OF AUTHORITY
Judge Slack Holds the Police Courts
Have No Jurisdiction In' Crimi
nal Libel. Cases. - â¢
A decision of considerable importance
was rendered by Judge Slack on Tuesday,
as it involves the jurisdiction of the police
courts in cases of criminal libel.
Recently J. B. Fleming, ex-pound
master, was arrested on the complaint of
Fred Osborn, superintendent of the
Pound, on the. charge of criminal libel.
When the case was called in Judge Con
lan's court. Attorney George H. Cabaniss,
who represented the defendant, asked for
a dismissal on the ground that the court
had no jurisdiction.' Judge Conlan re
fused to dismiss the case, believing that
he had jurisdiction, which had never be
fore been questioned.
Attorney Cabaniss thereupon . applied
for a writ of prohibition before Judge.
Slack. He argued that the statute which
created the present Police Courts and de
fined their jurisdiction omitted to give
them any sort of jurisdiction in cases of
libel, either for trial or for the preliminary
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1K96.
examination of a defendant. He admitted
that for years back these cases had been
taken into the Police Courts, but no one
had raised the point of jurisdiction, and
he contended that he was right in his in
terpretation of the statute.
Judge Slack in his decision, which is a
lengthy one, coincides with the argument
of Attorney Cabaniss and grants the writ.
Therefore in future all libel cases will have
to be taken at once before the Superior
Court, thereby saving the delay of being
heard in the Police Courts.
Attorney Cabaniss, while prosecuting at
torney of Judge Joachimsen's court, made
himself thoroughly familiar with the
statute and was therefore in a position to
raise the question of jurisdiction when the
opportunity offered in the Fleming case.
A BRUTAL MOTHER.
Mrs. Eliza O'Brien Arrested for Cruelty
to Her Little Daugh
ter.
Mrs. Eliza O'Brien of 292 Union street
was arrested yesterday by the officers of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children, and booked in the City Prison
on the charge of cruelty to children.
When the officers visited the house they
found the mother in a state of intoxica
tion, and the children hungry. There
was no food in the house, and everything
was in a filthy condition. Complaints
had been made to the society that while
drunk the mother had placed Tes?ie, aged
8, on the stove. The child, when ques
tioned, admitted that this was so, Her
right hand was badly burned and her left
hand bore the marks of scars. Tessie was
sent to the Children's Hospital, where her
wounds were cared for, and Maggie and
Katie, aged respectively 9 and 2, were sent
to St. Francis Orphan Asylum.
The fatherof the children, John O'Brien,
is in the City and County Hospital.
WITTLAND'S STATEMENT.
The Ex-Cashier of the Grangers'
Bank Left One With
Friends.
It Told His Story of the Systematic
Defalcations â Second Dividend
to Be Declared.
The Grangers' Bank, in liquidation, has
paid out nearly all the first dividend of
30 per cent declared by its directors re
cently, and it is believed that another divi
dend of 30 per cent, or at least 25, will be
declared on March 1.
It is mainly due to the unselfish and in
j defatigable endeavors of H. M. La Rue,
I president of the defunct institution, that
| such a creditable showing has become pos-
s ible. Mr. La Rue has devoted nearly all
| his time and attention to the bank since it
i closed its doors, and his friends say that
he will not desist until every dollar of the
bank's assets that can be collected is paid
:to depositors and stockholders. When
: this shall have been done the present
creditors of the bank will receive dollar for
I dollar. The president makes frequent
' trips into the country, and is now in the
San Joaquin Valby attending to the
bank's business. Each trip of his results
in a large addition to the treasury. On his
return there will, it is expected, be s'lffi
: cient money on hand to warrant the direc
tors declaring a dividend of 25 of 30 per
! cent on the first of next month.
Only once since William Wittland, the
[ absconding cashier, disappeared has he
j been .heard from, and that was about a
week ago in an indirect way through the
surety company which lost $10,000 over ,
his bonds. It hns transpired that Witt
land left a carefully prepared statement of
his defalcations, which he claimed aggre
gated $12,500. The bank directors en
deavored to get hold of the document,
which had passed into the hands of Witt
land's family, but it was kept from them.
It is now in the safe keeping of his coun
sel, Attorney Hewston.
Wittland, according to a friend who saw j
the statement, gave the amounts of his i
peculations in chronological order, and |
added them up to make a grand to'al of j
$12,500. He said that he had been drawn
into tbe dishonest practices by certain peo
ple outside the bank, who. influenced him to j
take money under the representation that j
he could not lose, but on the contrary i
would make a handsome profit and then j
be able to put the stolen money back j
privately. In this way he was led deeper I
and deeper into the difficulty, and when I
the bank was about to suspend he had to
seek safety in flight.
JUDGE LOW'S POSITION
The Ruling Against the Poker
Ordinance Based on the Ah
You Decision.
An Examiner Editorial That Calls
Forth the Criticism of the
Police Judge.
Through an editorial which appeared in
yesterday's issue of the Examiner, the de
cision rendered last week by Judge Low
overthrowing the poker ordinance was se
verely and unfairly criticized. Insinua
tions as to the Judge's honesty were also
indulged in, the editorial stating that "it
was not expected that he could be made
the tool of sharpers and sleight-of-hand
swindlers who object to the poker ordi
nance."
"It is evident," said Judge Low last
evening, "that the person who wrote that
gulling editorial is either unlearned in the
laws of the State in which he resides, or
else he has neglected to read my decision
on the case in full. It has been decided
by the Supreme Court of this State," he
i continued, "that it is not in the power of
the Board of Supervisors to impose a
greater punishment for an offense
than the Legislature has seen fit
to impose for a like or similar
offense. By section 330 of the Penal Code
the punishment prescribed by the State
law for playing prohibited gambling
games is a fine not to exceed $500, or by
imprisonment not to exceed six months,
or by both such fine and imprisonment.
"In thecase of ex parte Ah You reported
in 88 California, page 99, and in the case
of Soloman in 91 California, page 440,
both parties being prosecuted under mu
nicipal ordinances similar to the poker or
dinance, the Supreme Court decided in
favor of tne defendants, declaring all sim
ilar ordinances to be absolutely null and
i void. The ground upon which these or
dinances were declared void being that
they imposed a greater punishment for the
offense committed than did the State law.
I It is a very easy thing to frame an brdi-
I nance which will cover the entire matter
by simply prohibiting the playing of
poker, or allowing it to be played, for
j money in any saloon or other public place
! and by fixing the penalty by a fine of not
j more than $500 or imprisonment in the
j County Jail not to exceed six months, or
by both such fine and imprisonment.
"Such an ordinance would not infringe
upon the State law and in consequence it
would be valid and binding.
"As to my being made the tool of so
called snarpers and sieight-of-hand swin
dlers no statement could hav<* been made
which would have come further from the
truth. I decide all cases which come be
fore me according to the laws applicable
to them without regard to the moral as
pect, which, according to law itself, is a
secondary consideration."

HUNTINGTON'S GOOD BARGAIN.
Eig IPacific Port at Estrapaâ Danger
of the Coffee and Mahogany
Going East.
L. H. Griffith, formerly proprietor of the
Griffith bank at Seattle and for a year past
residing in Guatemala, where he has im
portant Government concessions, is at the
Grand. Among his concessions is the
privelege of nutting electric street cars in
Guatemala City and Antigua, and con
necting the two places also by electric
cars. The towns are seventy-two miles
apart. Mr. Griffith has also been instru
mental in starting the steamship freight
line between Seattle and the port of San
Jose de Guatemala, and furnishing Puget
Sound timber and lumber to Guatemala.
He says the country down there is in a
prosperous state. The hotels are all
crowded and there are many a dozen resi-
L. H. Griffith, Who Has Electric, Streetcar and Other Concessions in Guatemala-
dent American commercial men in
Guatemala City.
Just before Mr. Griffith left it was stated
that the sale of the Guatemala Central
Railroad to the English and Scotch syn
dicate had been consummated. It will be
recalled that some months ago it was an
nounced that C. P. Huntington had sold
the road to the said syndicate for $15,000,
--000 in silver, a sum equal to $7,400,000 in
goid. However, at this point President
Barrios stepped in. He was willing any
American syndicate should buy it, but he
did not like the idea of British capitalists
getting such a grip on the country.
"I think now, however, the matter has
been straightened out," said Mr. Griffith.
"The agent of the syndicate, H. E. Bag
gerly, was. a passenger down with me the
last time I was here. He completed his
report, and, as I understood it, it had been
accepted ana the pale made.
"There is a northern road to reach Port
Barrios, on the Atlantic side, from Guate
mala City, now being built, and there is
danger that when it is finished, or even
before, the trade that now comes here will
be diverted to New York. San Francisco
ought to look out for this and do all it can
to hold it. The northern road is being
built by the Government. The entire dis
tance between the two places is ISO miles.
Sixty-five miles of this, from the Atlantic
side, is now in operation. Besides this,
fifty miles more there are under contract.
"There is also a 45-mile section from the
Guatemala City end to be let right away.
When those two contracts are completed
freight can be transferred between the ter
minals. The coffee shipments then, in
stead of coming here, may go that way.
"The route of the road is very rough,
being largely over mountains. The cost of
building it is $200,000 a mile. There are
many gorges and canyons, requiring in all
thirty-nve miles of bridging in the 180
miles.
"Besides this important work the San
Luci branch road, from San Luci south to
a connection with the Occidental road at
Retaluhne, is being pushed forward
rapidly. This runs along the base of the
mountains on the Pacific Coast side
through a rich coffee belt. The road will
be an important feeder.
"Another important project by the Gua
temalan Government is the spending of
$7,000,000 at the new port of Estrapa, nine
miles below San Jose. It is at the mouth
01 a river and dockage is there furnished
for large ships. Over 7,000.000 feet of
lumber have been sent down there from
San Francisco during the last few months.
! The harbor is to become the important
I one for the Pacific coast in Guatemala.
All our steamers will eventually change
from San Jose to that point."
Mr. Griffith is here on a business trip.
He will be here about three weeks. He
says the completion of the San Luci road
will cause the shipment of large quantities
of mahogany as well as coffee. Mr. Griffith
says he expects to build his streetcar line
within the present year.
CRAB-FISHERS ALARMED.
They Lose a Day's Work in Order to
Fay Their Licenses.
The story published in The Call yester
day of how Deputy Fish Commissioners
Wilson and Davis caught four crab-fisher
men who had failed to pay the State
license and caused the offenders to be lined
by a Justice of the Peace in Sausalito
proved a sensation among those who fol
low this line of business. Dozens of the
crab-fishers flocked to the commission
headouarters in the Flood building to pay
for their licenses.
In consequence of the rush for licenses
but few boats went out yesterday, their
owners fearing to be caught by the depu
ties as they returned from the fisuing
grounds. During the day nearly all the
crab-fishers ob'.ained thÂ»iir licenses. In
consequence of the boats staying at home
yesterday it is likely that tuere will be a
scarcity of crabs on Friday, as much of
Friday's stocK is carried over froma live
the few days preceding the day on which
there is the greatest demand for a!l kinds
of fish.
FOUGHT TO MUSIC.
Souaa'a Experince With Two Young
sters Who Were Influenced by
Street Sounds.
A good many years ago John Dryden
celebrated in his delightful "Ode on St.
Cecilia's Day" the power of music upon
the human passions. Human nature has
not ereatly changed since. Alexander
and Thais, inspired by the minstel's song,
set fire to the palaces of Babylon, a fact
which is illustrated by the story which
Bandmaster Sousa has brought back with
him from his latest tour of the country.
"It happened in Exeter, N. H.," says
Mr. Sousa, "where we gave a concert one
afternoon. When we reached the hall I
found two juvenile residents of Exeter,
who by distributing handbills, had earned
the privilege of hearing the concerts from
behind the scenes. The youngsters had
some sort of a quarrel, and when 1 came
across tiiem were making threatening
demonstrations at each other. 1 separated
them and repeated the verse beginning,
'Let dogs delight to bark and bite' â you
may have heard of it. I sat them down
in two chairs, and gave them a lecture on
the sinfulness of fighting, until it was
time to go on the stage.
"From where I stood I could see the
boys, each in his chair, out in the wings.
We began with one of Li3Zt's Hungarian
rhapsodies movement, and as the music
proceeded the little fellows got out of their
chairs, and sidling alone toward one an
other, took up the quarrel where they had
left off.
"A collision was imminent, when the
music ceased and a soothing andante
movement followed. The boys resumed
their chairs and listened quietly during
this passage, even exchanging looks which
I interpreted as conciliatory and repent
ant. Another allegro movement followed
and the sta^e hands had to interfere to
keep the youngsters from punching each
other.
"Then we played a pretty, melodious
waltz and the boys kept perfectly quiet in
their chairs. I thought they had forgot
ten their feud and when the'waltz was en
cored I ordered the "Washington Post
March." Before we had played a dozen
bars the little rascals were having it hot
and heavy all over the side of the stag*.
The last I saw of them was the spectacle
of their ejectment from the stage-door,
o^ie of them stanching a profuse nasal
hemorrhage, while the other nursed a
badly blackened eye. It was the most for
cible demonstration of the influence of
music upon the human passions which I
remember having seen."
FOR A NEW CONEY ISLAND
Colonel T. P. Robinson in Part
nership With Mr. Sutro
at the Beach.
Together They Will Inaugurate a Be
wildering Series of Perpetually
Changing Attractions There.
There is to be an injection of life and en
ergy into tbÂ« Cliff House, Sutro Heights
and beach attractions from now on.
The ever popular ex-baseball manager
and Midwinter Fair amusement commit
teeman, Colonel Thomas Poniatowski
Robinson, has signed articles with Mayor
Sutro as arbiter elegantiarum, otherwise
amusement impresario at the Cliff.
The colonel will have sole control to
make contracts and bewilder the visitors'
minds with a kaleidoscope of wonders.
Already his sanguine soul sees a new
Coney Island or Manhattan Beach at the
terminus of the Sutro line. He has
prophetically arranged a trolley-wire to
the seal rocks, built an amphitheater for
entertainments, a bicycle-track, a drilling
ground, target range and "Venetian
canal," besides establishing a Cairo mid
way, with real camels, mirror-mnze,
haunted swing and other favorite mar
vels.
Tne giant Sutro baths will be the
colonel's piece de resistance, however.
Here he will give great water vaudevilles,
acrobatic and gymnastic tournaments,
while every day the band will play. The
Sutro museum is not overlooked by the
colonel's keen eye as a solid attractiod.
"We don't intend to have any^tommon
Punch and Judy snows," said TJeneral
Robinson yesterday, "but we will look out
for specialties, and, if necessary, engage
them to come here from the â¢ East. The
people will have a place where they can be
sure of entertainment, at a moderate cost,
in the daytime."
These vast projects will take time, bnt
it is the colonel's secret ambition â ihe
colonel is nothing if not dramatic â to have
all the wheels commence to turn at onee â
probably on March 14, two .weeks from
next Saturday.
Burglars Arrested.
Three burglars were booked at the City
Prison yesterday. Richard Cody and John
alias Neill alias Hanlon^ex-convicts,
were arrested by detectives Dillon and Crockett
lor breaking into the house of Mrs. J. R.
Sechrist, 1020 Sinter street, on February 17, and
stealing a quantity of jewelry and other arti
cles, a portion being found in Williams' pos
session when arrested. William Cooney alias
Magulre was arrested by policemen Ryan and
Freel for breaking into the house of Mrs. M.
Donovan, 2 Ritch street, on February 24 aud
stealing a lot of jewelry.

SWINE SPOIL BAY VIEW
Residents Ask the Supervisors
to Condemn Four Hog
Ranches.
THE STENCH IS UNBEARABLE.
Forty-Five People Say That Foul
Refuse Makes Their Homes
Unfit to Live in.
The many residents of Bay View, that
pretty little valley of South San Francisco,
have petitioned the Supervisors to remove
from their midst four hog ranches.
"There usea to be a time," said 8. L. Pi
per, who lives there and owns several lots
in that section, "when we would not have
exchanged our locality for any in the City.
The air was Dalmy and pure, and we all
enjoyed the best of health, but about two
years ago a hog rancher moved in down
near the beach. Since then three more
have followed, and now we have over 1000
hogs grunting under our very windows.
"The wind to-aay, as it rarely does,
comes strong from the southeast. *You can
smell the tilth, though, even now. Bui as
summer comes on and the weather be
comes warmer, the stench is something
horrible. Several times Jast year we were
compelled to leave our home and spend
the day somewhere else.
"The refuse from the ranches is piled
around on the beacu and on the marshy
ground adjacent to the pens. When hogs
die their carcasses are thrown over the
fence, and these, with the refuse, send
around this basin ir.to the windows of
the houses, three-qxiarters of a mile dis
tant, a stench that is almost overpow
ering.
"These foul sinks have kept hundreds
of families from building here, while if
they were removed there could scarcely be
found a pleasanter place to live.
"Down close by them sickness is very
frequent. The beach" was once as white as
that out near the Cliff House; now it lies
Beveral feet beneath the most nauseating I
tilth.
"One of the hog ranchers said, 'If people
around here don : t like the smell let them
move away. 1 But when you consider the
natural fitness of this location for a resi
dence and the hundred or more who iive
here already, it seems extremely unjust
that four people should render the entire
neighborhood unfit for anything but swine.
"Two months ago we petitioned the
Board of Health to remove the nuisance,
and that body referred the matter to a
committee, which declared it a nuisance
i and recommended its abolishment. Noth
ing, however, has been done. We sent in
a petition to the Supervisors last Monday
with the names of the following residents:
barrett, Silvester, Jeffers, Williams,
Colombo, Boviar, Piper, Kelly, Burbee,
Finch, Frank, Cullen, Peterson, Ferrier,
Monroe, Sintner, Bostiguda, Sister Stanis
laus of the St. Joseph Orphanage Asylum
and thirty other names of residents.
"These people reside in this locality, the
tract being bounded by Railroad avenue,
Fourteenth street. Twenty-first street and
the bay.
MALONEY WON HIS SUIT
He Gets a Judgmeot for $225 Against
Theodore C. Alarceau, the
Photographer.
Justice of the Peace Carroll decided the
case of J. H. Maloney, the turfman,
against Theodore C. Marceau yesterday in
favor of the plaintiff, giving him judg
ment for the entire amount asked, $225.
In 1895 Maloney ordered a lot ofÂ« photo
graphs from Marceau, but refused to ac
cept them on the ground that the likeness
and workmanship wore poor. Shortly
thereafter he prepared to depart for the
East and as he was leaving the Palace
Hotel was arrested on a warrant sworn
out by Marceau charging him with intent
to defraud his creditors by leaving the
State.
In order to prevent being detained Ma
lonoy paid the $2125 demanded by Marceau
for the pictures and went on lii:- way. Re
cently he returned and brought Â«nit for
the amount on the ground that it was
paid under duress and dv reason of threats.
An Officer's Contempt.
G. J. Ely, a police officer from Oakland, nar
rowly escaped being fined for contempt of
court by Judge Conlan yesterday. C. L.
Fountain was a witness in the case of Clarence
Turner, charged with attempt to rob, and as
soon as he had given his testimony Ely
stepped up to him and arrested him. The at
tention of the Judge was drawn to the matter,
and it looked serious for Ely. He explained
that Fountain was wanted for an attempt *o
rob in Oakland, and he meant no disrespect to
the court by arresting him. The Judge purged
him of contempt.

MORTON STREET AND WATER RATES.
Special Session of the Grand
Jury on These
Topics.
CHEAP WATER FOR SHIPS
Chief Crowley and the Police
Commissioners Tes
tified.
THE CRUSADE AGAINST VICE.
Many Dens of Infamy Closedâ Others
Will Be Suppressed With
out Delay.
A special meeting of the Grand Jury was
held yesterday afternoon. The witnesses
attending were Chief Crowley and Police
Commissioners Tobin, Aivoru and Gunst.
After a prolonged conference with District
Attorney Barnes the jury called on Chief
Crowley.
. It transpires that the subject of the mr
quiry was Morton street. The Chief made
a full statement of what had been accom
plished by the Police Department, acting
on the suggestion of the Police Commis
sioners. He said that -'many of the
women â keepers of the degraded dens on
that streetâ had been forced to leave the
locality, and -those remainine would be
compelled to leave. "
The Grand Jury commended Chief
Crowley and the Commissioners for the
good work already performed, and prom
ised to render all the assistance within the
power of the jury to further promote the
cause of decency.
The Chief did not hesitate to express his
entire confidence in the ability of the de
partment to close all the infamous places
on Morton street, and, when once closed,
to hold the advantage gained.
In regard to the work of the department
in the line of arresting gamblers and lot
tery dealers the Chief presented figures to
show that during his administration of
affairs 20,000 arrests had been made, and
the sum of $420,000 collected on fines and
forfeitures. Of lottery tickets thirty tons
Lan been seized.
William Alvord, Police Commissioner,
was the next witness called. He explained
to the Giand Jury what had been done by
the Commissioners and enumerated some
of the difficulties encountered by the com
mission in closing such places as those
which had made Morton street so noto
rious.
It was not ascertained whether Mr. Al
vord gave to the jury a list of the estates
and the names of property- owners inter
ested in property on this thoroughfare.
The Closing of the houses of ill fame may
diminish the income of owners for some
months, but ultimately this property, so
near the retail center of the City, will be- j
come so valuable for business purposes |
that the owners will gain rather than lose j
by the crusade against infamous tenants.
Commissioners Tobin and Gunst were
not called into the jury-room yesterday
afternoon. " " ;V.v;>'< ty.
The water committee of the jury pre- i
sented the following report :
Pan Francisco. Feb. 26, 1806.
Frank Mcukey, Foreman of the Grand Juryâ
Beak Sir: The water committee tike pleasure |
in submitting to you and other members of the
Grand Jury their final report with reference to I
the adjustment of the Spring Valley water ]
rates along the wharves of Sail Francisco, and
. append thereto a letter received from the
Spring Valley Water Company expressing their
earnest and heartfelt co-operation in adjusting
und correcting discriminations heretofore in
vestigated ana considered by this Jury along
the water front in the sale of water to the
shipping consumers, and also their conclu
sions, which we believe arc made in good
faith, regarding a reduction of shipping rates
in future.
In conclusion we desire to state that the offi
cers of the Spring Valley Water Company have
met your committee in a Rplrit of fairness and
equity In our investigations, and we feel as
sured they are sincere and will carry out the
reductions indicated in their communication.
Respectfully submitted. Â» ;â¢â  . â¢*

Following is the text of the letter from
the Spring Valley Water Company to the
Grand Jury to which reference is made in
the foregoing committee report:
San Francisco, Feb. 26. 1898.
' To the Honorable Grapri Juryâ Gentlemen:
We take pleasure in informing your honorable
body that the board of directors of the Spring
Valley Water.Works Imve concluded (and have
so advised the committee of the Board of Su
pervisors on water rates) that from and alter
July l, 1596, this company â will undertake the
direct supply of the shipping at the wharves of
Sau Francisco, and the experience gathered by
us as to outlay, consumption and expense dur
ing the latter half of this year will form a basis
for the fixing of the shipping water rates for
the future at the wharves. Very respectfully,
.*,--Â» Charles Webb Howard.

RICHMOND DISTRICT.
The Property-Owners of That Locality
Object to More Expensive Public
lint>roTementft at Present.
The Richmond district property-owners
are anxiously discussing the question of
saving their streets. Their watchword is
"Improvement," but they are beginning
to think that they have about as many
rrtiject? on iiand for the advancement of
their district as they can stand at present.
The recent proposal to bituminize certain
thoroughfares has divided Richmond,
that heretofore has pulled so well together.
The larger portion of the residents are of
moderate means, paying for their homes,
and the prospect of more bills for street
work is not agreeable.
Tlie objectors say that there remains so
much lateral and "side sewer work to be
done that much of the bitumen would
have to be torn up, patched and botched,
making poor work, with more and unnec
eaaary expense. They have a red-rock
quarry in the district which they aver will
supply cheaply all the pavement they
need at present. There are too many
loulevards mapped out, and the property
people along these avenuej are moving to
lay some of those motions on the table.
The A.nti-Cemetery Club is yet wrestling
with the graveyards, which, although
they have started, do not move out
of the City as fast as desirable. Tne
Cemetery Associations are not selling lots,
apparently, since the passage of the pro
hibiting ordinance, but the deeds of prior
purchases now being recorded have a
rare old flavor â too rare and too old to be
true. Ihey cannot understand why a
grave lot should have been boueht in the
early '60' s and '70' s and not be recorded
till the year of our Lord L 896.
A part of the cemetery question is the
proposed removal of the City graveyards
<m Thirty-third avenue. These are used
by certain benevolent societies for burial
purposes, also by the City for the inter
ment of tne indigent dead. Those pieces
of ground are rapidly filling up, and in
the courÃe of time burials there must of
necessity cease for want of space, and
when the City grows around them the
bodies will have to be removed. Charles
11. Hubbs, president of the Richmond
Property-owners' Association, is preparing
an ordinance which will be presented to
the Board of Supervisors soon. It pro
hibits interments in those cemeteries, and
'-* passed will open the way for the pur
chase by the City of a place of burial for
its dead without the limits or the erection
of a public crematory.
CHARGES OF FRAUD.
Grave Allegations Made by Mrs. Marie
Reusche.
Mrs. Marie RetibChe is suing her step
father for possession of certain property
which, she alleges, he secured from her by
fraud.
She claims that when her husband,
Fritz Reusche, died, she was appointed
administratrix, and under the guidance of
her stepfather and an attorney he selected
she managed the estate. She soon found
that her stepfather had all the property,
and now ehe charges fraud on the part of
her stepfather and her attorney. She says
the attorney is the one who probated her
husband's estate, and the record shows
this to be Julius Reimer. She is suing for
a cancellation of the deeds by which she
alienated her property and for an account
ing.
The Wong Sain Case.
The Wong Sam case was continued before
Commissioner ileacock yesterday until next
Tuesday, ham is charged with aiding in the
unlawful landing of Chinese womvii at this
port for immoral purposes.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
Continued Success of the Carleton
Company at Grover's
Alcazar.
The Auditorium Has Been Renovated
and a Brilliant Opening Is
Anticipated.
At the Baldwin Theater Frederick
Warde returned to "The Mountebank"
last night. The drama is not one tnat
shows either Mr. Warde or hi? leading
lady, Miss Fanny Gillette, in their hap
piest light.
To-night "The Lion's Mouth" will be
played, and at the Saturday matinee
'Virginias.' 1
Nellie McHenry's humorous take-off of
an up-to-date maiden in "The Bicycle
Girl" is pleasing CJ^.ornia Theater
audiences. The piece consists of the
string of jokes and specialties which,
if cleverly linked together, generally prove
attractive, even if the plot be conspicuous
by its absence. Miss Nellie McHenry in
"The Bicycle Girl" again shows herself to be a
sparkling comedienne, and the members of
her support are luliy up to the requirements oi
the various roles.
The C'arleton Opera Company is meeting with
well-deserved success at Grover's Alcazar in
"The Lily of Killarney." Miss Kena Atkinson,
the prims donna, has already become a favor
ite with the public, aud .lay" C. Taylor and \V.
T. Carleton are repeating the popularity they
have won here in lormer years.
The chorus has warnled more to its work
tnan it did on the opening night, and the per
formance, as a whole, is a thoroughly enjoy
able one.
The Columbia Theater will give a bloomer
matinee next Saturday afternoon, and every
bloomer-cled girl will be given free admission
to the theater to see Katie Putnam in "The Old
Lime Kilu.'" The farce-comedy, "A Railroad
Ticket," will be presented ai "the Columbia
Theater next week.
The remarkable stage mechanism in "The
! Pulse of New York" at the Grand has caught
!on immensely with the public. The pile-
I driver and the elevated railroad, with its mad
jump from the tract, are enough sensations to
< keep a melodrama going, not to mention the
! real pier and the conflagration, wflh its real
, iff.c electrical effects. Taken altogether â¢â¢The
; Pulse of New York" presents the most remark
i able stage setting that can Francisco has seen I
ior a long time.
Yesterday evening the cantata role of Casper
in "Der i'reischutz" was sung at the Tivoii
Opera-house by G. Napoleoni, who will alter
nate the rest of this week with John J. Raffael.
Next Monday eveniug Planquette'c opera
comique "Rip Van Winkle" will be presented,
under the musical directorship of Carl Mar
tins. Carrie Roma, who has just returned from
tue East, will reappear.
The Pantzer Brothers are the best attraction
at the Orpheum this week. Their excellent
acrobatic feats nightly arouse applause. The
rest of the new performers have not proved
quite up to the Orpheum's standard.
Messrs. Friedlander, Gottlob & Co. have
added another place of amusement to their
venture- in the Auditorium, which will he
opened to-morrow evening with Sousa's Band.
The stage has been enlarged. The interior
is linishea in white and gold, and the seating
capacity arranged to accommodate fully 2000
people. â¢
RECEPTIONS AND DANCES
A Large Tea Announced for
Saturday at the McLean
Residence.
Reception for Miss Charlotte Jewell.
Women's Press Association
Entertained.
The most prominent event of the week
will undoubtedly be the tea to be given
by Mrs. Robert McLean on Saturday at
her elegant home on Pacific avenue. The
date originally fixed for the. fashionable
entertainment was February 15, but owing
to sickness in Mrs. McLean's family, the
lady was obliged to postpone it to Satur
day. A great number of invitations have
been issued for tne affair, and as Mrs. Mc-
Lean is a most delightful hostess and her
home eminently adapted for large enter
tainments, the Saturday tea will certainly
be a rnoet enjoyable function.
A prominent Jewish marriage that is at
tracting considerable attention is that of
Miss Selma Altmayer. daughter of A.
Akmayer, president of the new Bnsh
street temple, and J. M. Jacdbi, a promi
nent manufacturer oi this City.
The wedding, which will take'place on
the 4th of March, will be solemnized in the
Hush-street synagogue, and is all the more
interesting seeing it iB the first marriage to
be solemnized in the new temple.
There has not been a synagogue wedding
â which is always a most elaoorateand im
pressive affair â since the brilliant mar
riage of Rabbi Metz and the lovely Mips
Frankel, one of the handsomest belles in
Jewish society.
On Saturday evening last Mr. and Mrs.
E. Bloch gave a delightful reception at
their handsome residence on Devisadero
street in honor of their lovely an<l attractive
niece, Miss Charlotte Jewell. The guests
started to arrive about 9:30 o'clock, an-1 were
received by Miss Jewell, assisted by Miss Eva
HcM'hoimer and Miss Marie Bauinan. The
house wu handsomely decorated. Palms and
ferns lined the walls and covered all the
corners in the drawiug-room, sitting-room ana
library; sniil&x entwined the chandeliers,
and misty ferus veiling pink carnations and
roses bauked the mantels and shelves. The
banquet hal! was decorated in the prevailing
colorsâ red and green. The orchestra was sta
tioned in the library, behind a screen of
palms, and furnished delightful music during
the evening.
Shortly after 10 o'clock danclne was in
augurated. During tbe evening Miss Lillian
Rothchild gave a whistling solo, which was
much enjoyed. At 12 o'clock an elaborate
supper was sÂ« rved, after which dancing was re
sumeu mid kept up until an early hour. The
guests carried off as souvenirs small hatchets
tietl with red, while and blue ribbon, which
were very appropriate coming as it did on
Washington's birthday. There were about 100
guests present.
The spacious home of Mr. aud Mrs. R. A.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY L' 7, 1896.
Marshall, at 551 Knox avenue, Oakland, was
thrown open Thursday evening to the Pacific
Coast Women's Press Association and other
frienas. Mrs. Marshall, known in the literary
world as Emma Seckle Marshall, was assisted
in receiving by Mrs. Eva Wren. The four
rooms of the mi! to were artistically decorated,
the most striking features being a mammoth
bunch of cnlla lilies' placed In a conspicuous
position, and the quantities of brilliant Cali
fornia poppies which gleamed among the

THEIR ROMANTIC WEDDING
Ida and Maud Itsell Were Mar
ried by a Justice of the
Peace.
MR. BRETZ FOLLOWED SUIT.
The Double Ceremony Was Unex
pected and on the Spur of the
Moment.
Ida May Ttsell married Seaberry Peter
son and Maud A. Itsell married Clifford J.
Bretz, Tuesday, under circumstances at
once romantic and peculiar. The young
ladies are daughters of Andrew J. Itsell,
vice-principal of the John Swett Grammar
School, a well and favorably known
educator. Both girls are pretty, intelli
gent and well-educated. They are of the
brunette type, with dark, liquid eyes.
Their marriage was a great surprise to
their parents, who reside at 1832 OTarrell
street. Justice Groezinger performed thÂ«
double ceremony in his office in the City
Hall, late Tuesday afternoon.
Mr. Peterson and Miss Itsell, who is just
21, and the eldest of the girls, har 1
been engaued for some time. So they sud
denly took it into their heads to wed, and
they accordingly followed out that line of
action without delay. Mr. Bretz and Miss
Maud went along as witnesses. The sug
gestion was made that a double wedding
might just as well be performed then and
there. A second license was therefore
taken out and Mr. Bretz and Miss Maud
were also married.
"I waa not altogether surprised over the
marriage of May to Mr. Peterson," said the
mother of the girls last night," but I can't
get over the shock that followed the an
nouncement that Maud had done like
wise. It was a grtat surprise to as. Her
father does not know it yet. She i 3 young
and had plenty of time in which to select
a husband. However, they are .married,
and I suppose we must make the best
of it."
Bretz is a son of State Senator Bretz of
Alameda, and Peterson's people, who are
still in ignorance of his marriage, live at
1716 Van Yess avenue.
LIQUOR TRAFFIC ABUSES
Action Taken by the California
State Protective Asso

Preambles and Resolutions Sent to
the Police Commissioners for
Consideration.
The California State Protective Associa
tion forwarded a few days ago the follow
ing communication to the Board of Police
Commissioners, which would have been
considered at last night's meeting of the
board if it had not been adjourned out of
respect to the memory of Chief Crowley's
?on:
San Francisco, Feb. 20, 1896.
To the Honorable the Board of Police Commis
sioners of the City and County of San Francinco â
Gentlemen: The undersigned, comprising the
board of trustees of the California State Pro
tective Association, beg leave to submit to the
consideration of your honorable body certain
preambles and resolutions embodying the
policy and general purpose of the association
in behalf of the correction of Certain evils and
abuses in the liquor traffic.
These resolutions whiih we submit to your
honorable body are intended for general appli
cation throughout the State, and are now
transmitted a* an initial step in an enaeavor
to enforce these principles through our organi
zation in every county and municipality in the
State, thereby placing the business of repu
table wholesale and retail merchants beyond
just criticism.
It is to be presumed that your honorable
body has at hand the ready means through
the instrumentality of your police force to
ascertain the places and establishments in
this City whose past methods and present
practices forfeit their right to license privi
leges, but in case our co-operation in this be
half is desired our organization will furnish
you the names of such places as we believe are
umvortny to hold a liquor license by reason of
their abuse of its privileges.
Assuring you of our high esteem and im
plicit confidence in your readiness to rectify
evils when properly brought to your attention,
we beg to remain, yours respectfully,

Following are the resolutions that ac
companied the communication:
Whereas, It is the purpose of the California
State Protective Association to promote the in
terests of its members by assisting so far as pos
sible in the reasonable and proper regulation
of the liquor traffic, and thereby suppressing
objectionable and obnoxious features incident
thereto, so that the business, property and
vested rights of reputable persons and firms
engaged therein may not be jeopardized; and
whereas, the promiscuous granting of retail
liquor licenses and the abuse of privileges
under those already granted is calculated
to injure the business; and whereas,
this association will not countenance Infrac
tions of reasonable regulations, and requires
all members, unaer penalty of expulsion, to
observe the same, both In letter and in spirit,
where such laws and regulations are accepted
by or not contested in the courts by this associa
tion upon just and legal grounds; and, where
as, in the opinion of this association a proper
and conservative regulation of the granting
and maintenance 1 of licenses is the most im
portant and efficacious method of reform that
can be inaugurated; and, whereas, we regard
the granting or continuance cf retail liquor
licenses to disreputable resorts a reflection
upon tue good name, peace and good order of
every municipality where such places are suf
fered to ex3Â«=t; therefore be it
~fciÂ«oZw;d, That we hereby petition all muni
cipal, police and other boards having the
granting power in the State of California to
carefully scrutinize every application for a re
tail liquor license in the future, and to insti
tute a thorough inquiry into tne character of
the place and the fitness of the person holding
existing licenses, to the end that in the future
oniy reputable applicants shall receive li
cei.ses, and that all licenses now held by dis
reputable establishments may be revoked.
Resolved, That, the secretary of this associa
tion; be and ne is hereby instructed to fur
nish a copy of this preamble and resolutions,
under the seal of the association, to every gov
erning body and municipal board throughout
the State of California.

CHIEF CROWLEY'S LOSS
His Son Samuel Died Yesterday
After a Lingering
Illness.
The Police Commissioners Adjourned
Last Night Out of Respect to
His Memory.
The Police Commissioners did not do
any business last night. After President
Tobin had called the meeting to order
Commissioner Gunst rose and said: "I
move that the meeting do now adjourn
out of respect to the memory of Chief
Crowley's son." The president declared
the meeting adjourned and that was all.
The heartfelt sympathy of the members
of the Police Department and the public
generally will be extended to Chief Crow
ley and Mrs. Crowley in their sad afflic
tion. Their son Samuel after a lingering
illness died yesterday afternoon in his
thirtieth year. He had been gradually
wasting away and on Monday the Chief
insisted that the attending physicians
should tell him the worst. They reluc
tantly told him that his son could not live
more tnan two days, and so it proved.
"It is hard," the Chief said, "to lose both
our sors. It was bad enough to lose one,
but to have both taken away in their
young manhood is doubly hard to bear."
Tne Chief's younger son, Louis, an am
iable, bright and intellectual young man
educated for the church, died about three
years ago in his twenty-fourth year, and
his loss was a terrible blow to his father
and motlier.
Samuel was born in this City and was a
member of Yerba Buena Lodge of the Na
tive Sons of the Golden West. Until a
year or two ago he was a strong robust
young man, but an insidious disease grad
ually undermined his constitution and he
breathed his last shortly after 4 o'clock
yesterday afternoon.
The funeral will take place to-morrow.
Mr. Pelton's Request.
J. C. Pelton, the venerable educator, says
that his application to the City Hall Commis
sioners for quarters in the City Hall was mis
construed. He did not ask for living quarters
being already located at Ocean View, but
merely fcr the privilege of deskroom, or an odd
corner in which he might pursue his literary
work, which includes a volume to be entitled
"Sunbeams and Shadows."

L. HEINE WILL NOT STAY.
The 'Cellist Shakes Off the
Dust of the Tivoli
Orchestra.
He Was Replaced by Martens After
Being Told to Go Ahead
and Conduct.
When Adolph Bauer retired from the
Tivoli conductorship the management of
the theater requested Louis Heine, the
well-known local 'cellist, to go ahead and
take his place. Mr. Heine complied, and
as a consequence difficulties have arisen,
which will result in the 'cellist's leaving
San Francisco.
It is asserted by Mr. Heine's friends that
when Adolph Bauer laid down the baton
the position of conductor was formally
offered to the young 'cellist. He accepted,
and C. Gutterson was made 'cellist in His
place, and for two weeks all went well
under his leadership. At the end of that
time Carl Martens of the Tavary Opera
Company intimated to the Tivoli manage
ment his desire to remain in San Fran
cisco. His overtures were accepted and
Louis Heine received an intimation to re
turn to his 'cello.
The friends of the young musician say
that he could not be expected to brook
this setback tamely, and they applaud him
for the course he took in at once notifying
the Tivoli that he would sever all connec
tion with the theater when he laid down
the baton. Mr. Heine himself does not
wish to make any statement for publica
tion at present, but he does not deny that
he was offered the position vacated by
Adolph Bauer, and that when he least ex
pected it, the intimation was given him
| that in two weeks Carl Martens would
take his place.
Mrs. Kreling says she had no idea of
making Louis Heine permanent con
ductor. "We told him to go ahead and
take Mr. Bauer's place," she said, "but he
had substituted for our leaders before and
did not object to returning to the 'cello
when Hirschbach had been away and
came back again. Mr. Martens was at the
Tivoli nine years ago, before he joined
Emma Abbott, and we were naturally
anxious to get him back again."
Louis Heine will conduct at the Tivoli
for the las,t time on Sunday evening. The
last time he plays before his departure
north will probably be at the fiftieth Carr-
Beel oopular concert on Saturday after
noon, when a number of the society ladies
intend to give a reception to the perform
ers after the concert. Louis Heine has ac
cepted the position of conductor with an
opera company which George E. Nash in
tends to take on the road. The tour opens
at Portland, Or., after which the troupe
will tour the Pacific Coast until June.
The future plans of tne 'cellist are not
permanently settled. He may either re
turn to this City or go East at the con
clusion of the tour. His ability as a mu
sician is well established, and local mu
sical circles will feel his loss.
UNCLAIMED PROPERTY.
Seml-Anuual Clean-up of the Property
Clerk's Department.
The semi-annual clean-up of the police
property clerk's department was finished
yesterday and the unclaimed money and
property were handed over by Property
Clerk Cullen to the City Treasurer. The
cash, which was in small sums, amounted
altogether to $274.
Among the articles were a cradle, gaso
line stove, boxing gloves, a pair of crutches
about 100 revolvers of all descriptions a
large quantity of knives, razors and scis
sors, umbrellas, walking canes, jewelry,
watches, clothiner, trinkets and lots of mis
cellaneous things.
FilliSSfllfSl
A Gentleman From That State
Expresses Opinion
About a Leadinsr Californian and
Coast Institution.
TT IS TRUE THAT SOME RWOV THE VTS-
-*- itors to the hospitable ahorrs of this Oolden
State go back to their homes ami vow that Califor-
nia is populated by "jays," "hayserds' and go
forth, but they nre usually actors of inferiortal-
ents or disap-pointrd speculators who have at-
tempted to place some not too sweet-srneliuu
scheme on the market, and have found that the
people who livt- here don't takeall thoy hear for
gospel truth without investigating a little. A crit-
icism of our great nifdicul institutions, of which
we are so rightly proud, has until now not been
pronounced, but it comes with grace from a man
who has tried and therefore knows whereof he
speaks. It is Mr. Frank Minturn who has spoken,
and as he speaks of the Hudson Medical Insti-
tuteâindubitably the greatest and finest of itn
nature on this Slopeâ his remarks are well worth
being reproduced. He writes as follows:
ST. I.OUIB, Mo., Aver. 9, 18U5.
Bndton Afeflicnl finfffrtfr. Am Ti iiiiii tiro. Oil.â
Gkntlkmes: A few months ago I placed myself
under your treatment. M I liftd been a sufferer for
a long time from a complication of diseases that
seemed to successfully resist all treatment. I
must confess that I was at first, skeptical about
plncine myself undtr the carp of physicians thou-
sands of milÂ«s away, but I had reached a point
wherp something had to be done at once, as I could
neither sleep nor eat, and my whole system seemed
to be completely worn out.
I now desire to express to you my sincere thanks
for the careful, conscientious and successful man-
ner in whVch my case has been treated by you. I
am a very different man to-day, and I have not
felt as well iv five years as I do now. I desire to
say to those who axe suffering from diseases- of
long standing, of whatever nature, that it is my
honest opinion if they will write or apply to ihe
large white building at the corner of Market,
Stockton and Kills streets, San Francisco. I be-
lieve th"y will find the relief that they seek, and
that they will receive the same careful and skillful
treatment that I did at the hands of the Hudson
Medical Institute.
Wishing you continued success in your efforts to
aid suffering humanity, I am, very truly,
FRANK MIN TURN,
St. Louis, Mo.
This is certainly a|very strong indorsement of
the great institution, but it may be frankly stated
that It is no better or more frank than several
hundreds of our people, who say things equally
good week in and week out. From Panoche, Cal.
comes this :
Robert Ashurst Jr. writes: "Have gained six
pounds since commencing treatment. I would not
take $500 to relapse into the state I was in be-
fore."
S. J. Bailey of Weaverville, Cal. : "I will now
state after two months' treatment with you thai I
feel fully restored to health."
K. C. Taft of Stowe. Cal.. says: "I am feeling
fine, without a sign of disease now."
E. W. Fowler: "I am feeling as good now as it
Is possible for a man to feel."
If space permitted, this sort of testimony could
be prolonged Indefinitely. Never a mail comes
but there are many letters expressing thanks and
esteem for what has been done for those who have
placed themselves under the skill of the physicians
of the HUDSON MEDICAL INSTITUTE, and it
is now a proverbial saying that "If you want to
get cured QUICKLY and CERTAIXJLY that is
the only place to go."

LETTER TO SENATOR SHERMAN
Startling Facts Brought to Light by
John T. DoyleâAn Investiga
tion Likely.
One of the most iniquitous practices re
sorted to by C. P. Hu:. .ington and his col
leagues to defraud the people of the coun
try, who Have been induced by fair
promises and gross misrepresentations to
invest in the securities of the companies
comprised in the Southern Pacific Com
pany, has up to the present writing, been
entirely ignored, notwithstanding that
somewhat over $90,000,000 worth of securi
ties are involved.
Attention was first called to this imposi
tion on the financial world in a letter ad
dressed to Senator John Sherman by John
T. Doyle on January 30, IS!'5, in reference
to the funding measure now before Con
press pertaining to the indebtedness of the
Central Pacific Railroad Company to the
Government.
In arguing against the funding bill, Mr.
Doyle wrote as follows:
"If Congress undertakes to taKe title to,
or security on, this Central Pacific road,
without previous judicial ascertainment
and adjudication of the details of prop
erty and its title, it will probably get a road
without terminals, without ferry accommo
dations, without adequate stations or toll
ing stock â a skeleton road ; what has been
epigrammatically described as 'two streaks
of rust and a right of way.'"
In explanation of this broad and peculiar
assertion Mr. Doyle continued as follows:
"It is not generally known that the rail
road business carried on by these parties,
for the past twenty years, has been done,
not for the legitimate profits of transpor
tation, but from those derived from the
issuance and sale of railroad bonds.
"Every piece of property the road be
comes possessed of is Btraiebtway niort
fa^ed for all it will possibly bear, and the
onds taken by the managers themselves,
under the now familiar disguise of a con
struction company. The interest is punc
tually paid (or receipted for) by themselves
to themselves, until by the aid of stock
board manipulations the ownership of the
rities is gradually transferred to the
public in search of investments.
"The ruurigages are usually so arraneed
as to present ilie semblance of a substan
tial security, and yet to afford no real one
to the holder, because the thing mort
gaged is wholly incomplete and unservice
:ne other property which is
mortga to other parties for other debts.
â¢ I !.e Southern Pacific Company as gen
eral le-see can put all the separate parcels
. .c use, but the mortgagees when
they come to foreclose and own the secur
ity will tind they have got but one leg of
a pair of tongs, the other leg of which is
retained by the Southern Pacific Company.
"This peculiar mode of dealing is iamy
iliustrated by the mortgage of the Central
Pacific Railroad to secure one sstof bonds,
and the mortgaging of the terminal
grounds, indispensable to its utility, to
secure another, while the connecting
ferry is a separate property belonging to
neither.
"Similarly the first mortgage of the
Southern Pacific Railroad (April 1, 1875)
nominally covers a single T oad leading
frim San Francisco to tne Colorado River.
Passengers and freight sent overland via
the Southern Pacific road are supposed' to
EaÃS .over the mortgaged line and no other,
it tbifl is a delusion, for when the rhort
gage was made the Md was under con
struction and it was built tc sections.
"The section of ll'i miles or so connect
ing the track through the Santa Clara Val
ley with that through the valley of the
."-an Jjaquin (a very difficult piece of
mountain road ana expensive to con
btruot) has never been built and the build
ing of it has been abandoned. Passengers
and freight by the Southern Pacific road
are dependent upon the Central Pacific
road (San Joaquin Valley division) and
other roads for access to San Francisco.
"The bonds of this issue having all been
i off to the public, the managers
have no longer any motive for building
tiie connecting link across the coast range,
and in their latest mortgage (September
15, 1893) covenant to issue no more bonds
under that of 1875, which is equivalent
to a covenant never to complete the orici
nal road described in that mortgage.
These are spt-cimen cases."
In another portion of this communica
tion occurs the following:
"The report of the Pacific Railway Com
mission (vol. X, p.") shows that the net
earnings of the Central Pacific road over
all operating expenses, taxes, interest on
debt and Government requirements â abso
lute clear profits â were as follows:
Down to Dec. 31, 1869 $2,427,533 80
- IO r>ec. 81. 1873 6,575,519 32
1 hence to Jan. 1, 1884 62,536.916 9fl
jn all $61,539,970 11
"The capital 3tock is shown in the same
report to have been entirely 'fictitious and
the whole of the $246,062^65 (the gross re
ceipts from whicii this residuum was de
rived) was wrung from the pioneers of the
Pacific Coast, and chiefly from the people
of California, by excessive charges levied
mainly on local traffic. Honestly applied
it would have extinguished the whole Gov
ernment debt."
In concluding his letter to the Senator
Mr. Doyle wrote:
"Senator Sherman, the people of Cali
fornia have faith in you and trust you,
predisposed to this by their affectionate
admirution for your brother, the general,
who roughed it here with us in early days,
a;!-] whom they proudly reckon as one of
themselves They have been confirmed in
it by their observation of your public
career and the kindly recollections they
cherish of your visits to our State and of
their intercourse with you.
â¢They are convinced that to extend or
refund this railroad debt will make it a
t.tal loss to the United States and inflict a
dire calamity on them, besides tacitly
Mtnctiouing a series of enormous frauds,
the pardon of which would be disgraceful
to the country. They are equally per
suaded that a study of the case will so con
vince every upright and Impartial mind.
Very many of us rely on you to eive it
such study, and to give us the aid of your
voice and influence to defeat co odious and
oppressive a measure."
Many of the bonds (in the way de
scribe ' â â  Mr. Doyle) are said to be now
hÂ». ids of trust companies and sav
ing indications, many having been sold at
10 per cent above par.
In view of these facts it is not unlikely
that the committees of etock boards which
list these improperly and inadequately se
cured bonds may institute an inquiry, or
some large holder of these securities may
take action leading to an investigation of
the matter.
FOR $100,000.
That Is the Figure for Which tlÂ»o Young
Men's Christian Association
Reaches.
An appeal has been made by the mem
bers of the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion for $100,000 with which to pay for
their new building. In a note to The
Call. Secretary McCoy says that the can
vass for funds with which to pay the
association's indebtedness has so far pro
gressed that it is considered opportune to
make a general appeal to the public. The
appeal is as follows: :-
To tin People of San Francisco: The critical
condition, financially, of the Young Men's
Christian Association of San Francisco, has
recently been so fully set forth In the City pa
pers that the subject' has come to be generally
understood.
The unexampled business depression- which
followed the financial crash of 1893 came on
while the plans for its new building were be
ing carried out, subjecting the management to
embarrassment and disappointment in various
ways â more particularly in th.eir efforts to dis
pose of assets relied upon to meet the increased
obligations incurred. The new home was
completed, but payment being in arrears, it
. has not yet been dedicated, and will not be
until it is entirely free from debt. In order to
effect this, the trustees have made the most
diligent efforts to find a limited number of
public-spirited citizens and business firms
who would agree to give in the aggregate
100,000, no pledge to be binding until this
amount is subscribed.
To endow the institution the sum of $150,
--000 is needed, and it is believed that the pub
lic in general will contribute the balance in
smaller sums. The regular income from rentals
ana membership fees will meet all its current
expenses.
After eight months of strenuous exertion we
have pledged to us $77,500, but to secure it,
according to the conditions named, $22,500
must be promptly added. At this critical
Mrs. McMullin, her Son and, Sitting Opposite to Her, Her Husband, the Principals in a Peculiar Case.
| stage the good work lags. We therefore, while
continuing in the line of effort mentioned,
make this appeal direct to thecommunity, and
would say to each member thereof: Reflect, if
j but for a moment, upon the acknowledged
! merits of the association and the urgency of its
present needs, of which there can be no ques
tion.
The hope and future of any nation, State or
city is in its young men, and freedom from
debt is essential to this orgarization to enable
it to prosecute effectively its treat mission
among the 5(J,0U0 young men of this City. It !
undertakes to promote the physical, intel- \
lectual, social and moral well-being of young
men. thus proving itself one of the most useful i
and important institutions of the age. It. is
non-sectarian, having within its membership
those of the Protestant, Catholic and Hebrew
faiths. Any young man of good character is eli
gible to become a member, and all its appoint
ments and facilities are placed within his
reach at a nominal fee. Probably no place in
the worid needs a work of this kind more than
Ill's City.
We do not believe that the people of San
Francisco will allow a work of so much im
portance, and an institution so broad in spirit,
to laÂ«k the necessary means to extricate itself
from unforeseen and" unavoidable difficulties.
Help us to the extent of your ability. For the
sake of Jesus Christ, in whose nanie and for
whose cause we labor, helu us. For the sake
of a struggling, rising humanity, help us. For
the fair fame and well-being of this great City,
help us.
11. J. McCoy, for the past fourteen years
general secretary of the association, will, at
the request of the trustees, undertake a can
vass to aid in securing the necessary funds to
liquidate the debt. He will have the full co
operation of the board, and they most heartily
commend him to the community.

Nicholas Claussen, the baker who fatally

by Attorney Walter Gallagher.
After being instructed as to his rights as
a defendant his preliminary examination
was, at the request of his attorney, fixed
for March 5 in order. to await the decision
of the Coroner's jury.
Claussen showed by his manner that he
was as callous and indifferent as ever. If
he realizes the full extent of his cold
blooded crime his appearance does not in
dicate it. , Acting under the instructions
of his attorn he now declines to ' talk.
The defense will probably be insanity. ,:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1896.
HIS FATHER A STRANGER
Peculiar Position of Young La
tham McMullin of This
City.
SEQUEL TO A SEPARATION.
Mrs. Virginia McMullin Is Suing for a
Large Sum for Her Main
tenance.
For nearly twenty years Latham Mc-
Mullin has lived in this City and yet he
has never known his father, who has been
here at the same time. McMullin sepa
rated from his wife in 1877 and since then
no communication has pasaed between
them.
Mrs. McMullin is now suing for main
tenance. After a lapse of nineteen years
she wishes her husband to pay her $350 a
month alimony and $4200 for the twelve
months preceding the filing of her suit.
She alleges desertion on the part of the
defendant, but she does not ask for a
divorce, for she says she is opposed to
divorces on religious grounds. The suit
was on trial before Judge Seawell yester
day.
Virginia McMullin, the plaintiff, was
! the first witness called. She said her hus
| band, Thurlow McMullin, was a traveling
agent for Tilliuann, Bendel & Co., ana was
earning $425 a month. They were mar
ried in 1871. For two years they lived
together and then trouble began. She
said he stayed away from home 170 nights,
and finally when he sent her a note one
evening saying he would not be home to
dinner, she sent him this answer:
Mr. Thurlow McMullin: Stay where you are,
if it will keep me from ever seeing you again.
To-morrow 1 take steps 'or a divorce.
Virginia McMullin.
This letter was the beginning of the end.
McMullin left his wife soon after and since
then he has not seen her. For six months
the child which had been born to them
was taken to its father regularly once a
week, but after six months had passed the
mother put a stop to the visits of the child,
and from that time the husband ceased to
pay her Dills.
While on the stand Mrs. McMullin said
j she had not seen her husband since they
parted. She has been in the City since
then and so has he, but she has never seen
him ; nor did she know him when he con
fronted her in court. Her son Latham was
in a similar state. He had never seen his
father to recognize him, and when he took
tbe stand he denied knowing him. He was
| asked if he had met his father, and he said
"no." Then he was asked if he knew his
j father, and again he said "no." Then he
was asked to point out his father in the
courtroom, and though in his glance
around his eyes met those of his parent, he
could not indicate the man. Then for the
first time his lather was pointed out to
him. He was asked if he knew who the
man was and for the third time he said
The Witness denied that his mother had
ever attempted to poison bis mind against
his father. He said that his mother had
always providod for him and his father
had done nothing, so he did not have any
interest in his father at all.
Thurlow McMullin's testimony was
peculiar. He said he had left his wife De
cause he believed she desired it. Once
since he had written to her asking her to
live with him as his wife again, but she
refused. He said he had often gone down
to Baker & Hamilton's store, where his
son works, and nad inquired about his
child. He kept track of the boy, but never
spoke to him. His life is insured for
$5000 in favor of his wife and child. He
said he earns $425 a month, and from that
he must pay his traveling expenses.
What property he has is unproductive, and
he has to pay interest on a $10,000 mort
gage on some land he owns in Fresno
County.
When the testimony for the plaintiff
was all in Charles S. Wheeler, counsel for
defendant, moved for a nonsuit, but
Judge Beawell was unwilling to grant it
offhand, so the case will continue to-day.
DEFENDING THE CHARTER.
The Merchants' Association Dis
pute the Ground Taken by
J. M. Reynolds.
The Constitution Regarding Two
Boards of Supervisors for
Cities Amended.
"The supposed defect discovered by
John M. Reynolds in the proposed new
charter," said J. Richard Freud, secretary
of the Merchants' Association, yesterday,
"is really no defect at all."
The Merchants' Association is among
the strongest advocates of the new charter
and its secretary, speaking of the criti
cisms of Mr. Reynolds, said that the
clause to which exception had been taken
had no real existence, but had been
amended out of the proposed charter.
Mr, Freud then cited the section in ques
tion, which reads as follows:
Section 7, Article Xl.â City and county gov
ernments may be merged and consolidated
into one municipal government with one set ot
officers, and may be incorporated under gen
eral laws providing for the incorporation and
organization xÂ»f corporations for municipal
l>iirjÂ«oseii. The provisions of this constitution
applicable to cities, and also those applicable
to counties, so far as not inconsistent or pro
hibited to cities, shall be applicable to such
consolidated government. J
Continuing Mr. Freud said: "Mr. Rey
nolds' entire argument therefore falls to
the ground. The premises being incorrect
the conclusions drawn are necessarily so.
The advocates of the new charter simply
ask that those who would criticize it would
do so fairly and with a strict regard to its
merits.
"The charter as proposed for this City is
by no means perfect. No hun.au work is
infallible. It is, however, such a vast im
provement upon the present unsatisfactory
method of government in this City that it
is idle for any one of intelligence to say
that it is drafted In the interest of corpora
tions.
"Section 8 of the constitution was
amended by the Legislature in the session
of 1890, and adopted by the people at the
election in November, 1892. Thus it will be
plainly seen that Mr. Reynolds is in error
regarding the charter and the law bearing
on its being brought into operation, pro
vided the people see lit to adopt, it."
Mr. Reynolds' interview in The Call
yesterday has brought out the following
strong letter from Charles Wesley Reed :
The Call this morning prints an interview
with John M. Reynolds in whioh he announces
his hostility to the new charter; states that he
has been looking for a fatal defect in it, and
declares that his search has been rewarded.
He finds that the new charter has provided for
only one Boara ot Supervisors, while the con
stitution requires that there shall be two. "It
seems incredible," says Mr. Reynolds, "that a
board of freeholders composed of intelligent,
thinking men, some of them attorneys, should
have made such a mistake."
It is indeed incredible. It is a pity that it is
not equally incredible that the opponents of
the charter should make ridiculous and un
founded statements of what the new charter
contains, and what the effect of its adoption
will be.
In 1894 the people of the State of California
adopted an amendment to section 7, article XI
of the constitution, by which all that portion
of the section relating to two houses of legisla
tion in consolidated cities and counties was
omitted, leaving to such municipalities the
power to have one, two, or hall a dozen houses
of legislation, as they might elect.
Section 7 of article XI of the constitution
(amended in 1494) is as fjllows:
City and county governments may be consoli-
dated and merged into one municipal government
with one set of officers and may be incorporated
under general laws providing for the Incorporation
and organization of corporations for municipal
purposes. The provisions of this constitution ap
plicable to cities, unit also those applicable to coun
ties, so fur as not Inconsistent nor prohibited to
cities, shall be applicable to such municipal gov
ernment. . , Â/i,: â â 
If the prominent attorneys mentioned by
Mr. Reynolds gave him the advice he claims
they dia, they, as well as he, must bear the
responsibility of making unreliable and care
less statements regarding the new charter to
create an unfounded prejudice against that
instrument.
From now on one may expect the opponents
of the new charter to bring up every argument
at their command to secure its rejection, but it
is safe to say that if they would spend a small
portion oi tUe time in searching for its good
points which they now spend in the discovery
of defects, which exist only in their own im
agination, the new charter would have suffi
cient friends to make its adoption by a large
majority certain.
The reason that Mr. Reynolds assigns for his
industry in searching for defects in the new
charter which do not exist is that "it puts too
much power in the hands of one manâ the
Mayor." That of course is the one great rea
son that the enemies of the new charter give
for tneir opposition. The supreme test in the
I'nited States of the wisdom and Americanism
of any constitution or charter is the constitu
tion of the United States. That instrument
provides ftir the concentration of all executive
authority in the United States Government in
the hands of one man. The practical Buccess
of the Government provided by the constitu
tion is the just pride ot every American. The
new charter is an approach toward the consti
tution from the miserable irresponsibility and
inefficiency of our present Consolidation Act.
It does not, however, attain to the standard
net by the American constitution. It dyes not
go lar enough in concentrating executive
authority to satisry the requirements of a good
constitution, measured by that instrument in
which all tnat is American lives and moves
and hae its being-.
Until the constitution is changed by the
people, all the officers who are at present
elective will continue to be elective except the
City and County Attorney, the Superintendent
of Streets and the City and County Surveyor.
Certain officers, who are now appointed by the
Governor or hold for life, will be appointed by
the Mayor. The wildest opponents of the new
charter admit that now the Mayor, has too
littio powerâ that he la little more than a
ih-'urehead. The power that ho has under the
new charter will hardly bo any greater until
the people vote to change the constitution.
Surely the people have a rirht to the form of
government that they desirp, but until they
will have manifested that desire by amending
the constitution the ' Mayor, under the new
charter, will not have r greater addition of
power than the most conservative and cautious
man would deem necessary for the successful
management of affuirs.
A DINNER BY LUIGI.
The Prince Entertains Officers of the
Colombo and Other Friends at
the Palace.
Prince Luiei of Savoy last night gave a
dinner to the officers of the Cristoforo
Colombo and other guests at the Palace
Hotel. It was a swell affair. The tables
were arranged in the form of a hollow
square, potted palms being artistically ar
ranged in the center. At one end, juat
over the Italian prince, was the flag of his
native land, and at the other was the
American fag.
Among the guests aside from the officers
of the Colombo were the following: Horace
Platt, General Forsyth, James L>. Pnelan
Lieutenant J. F. I). Sandis, John P.
Fugazzi, John Craig, Hugh Craig, presi
dent of the Chamber of Commerce, Count
Cerri and the Italian Consul.
There were a number of handsome floral
decorations. The room looked very beati
ful. 1 here were a number of speeches all
by the Italians being in the Italian lan
guage. When the Prince arose to speak
everybody else arose and remained Btand
ing till he had finished. Count Cerri
made a brief address.

ONE YEAR OF THE S. P.
That Corporation's Report for
Twelve Months Up to
Last June.
SOME SIGNIFICANT FIGTJBES.
Statements Furnished by the Company
Regarding Its Annual Earnings
and Expenses.
The annual report of the Southern
Pacific Company for the year ending June
30, 1895, was presented to the Board of
Railroad Commissioners at the board's
monthly meeting yesterday. It was ac
companied by a letter from Mr. Klink,
acting secretary of the company, who
made apologies for the delay in not filing
the report earlier. The excuse was that
owing to the iliness and death of Secretary
Lansing the report could not have been
prepared at an earlier date.
The report begins with the statement
,that the Southern Pacific Company was
i organized March 17, 1884, under the laws
tof the State of Kentucky. The charter
wa9 approved March 17, 1884, and again
on March 21, 1888. The directors live in
New York and in San Francisco, but none
in Kentucky. At the last election of di
rectors there were 162 stockholders in the
corporation. â 
The lines in the system include tne
Southern Pacific in California, Southern
Pacific in Arizona and New Mexico, the
South Pacific Coast Railway (narrow
gauge), Northern Railway, Northern Cali
fornia Railway, California Pacific, Union
Pacific (five miles west of Ogden), Central
Pacific, Oregon and California Railway
and Northern Railway, aggregating 4874.81
miles.
Notwithstanding the fact that officials
of the company have at various times
! stated the Southern Pacific owned and
! operated a coal mine up north, it is writ
i ten in the report that the company owns
no mine that would affect the general bal
ance sheet.
The capital stock consists of 1,500,000
shares â par value $100 each. The total
amount issued and outstanding is $120,
--934,170, of which $1,000,000 is represented
I by shares issued for cash, the balance
having been given for stock of railway
companies.
The income account for the Atlantic and
Pacific systems of the Southern Pacific
shows gross earning from operation, $35,
--847,810 36; operating expenses, $23,797,
--596 24. Dividends on stock and interest
on bonds are aided. Then deductions are
made to cover interest on funded debt
I accrued, on interest-bearing current lia
bilities accrued, rents, taxes, permanent
improvements and "other deductions."
The total gross earnings from operation
are stated at $31,245,143 89, made up as
follows: Total freight earnings, $19,187,
--454 08; total passenger earnings, $11,021,
--129 62; total other earnings, $1,036,560 19.
In the long list of stocks owned appears
the Northern California Railway, par
value $1,280,000, valuation $10. The total
valuation of stocks aggregates $123,260,
--j 900 16. The list of bond's owned is much
| lighter, footing up $2,621,378 38.
Then follow particular^' of rentals re
! ceived, operating expenses and rentals
paid.
Unfler the head of, "important changes
during the year" are only noted: "Steam
ship bonds redeemed, $143,000," and "ma
terials and supplies acquired in the opera
tion of the Central Pacific Railroad
transferred to the ownership of that com
pany."
Touching "contracts, agreements, etc.,"
appear these significant notes: "Rates for
mails are fixed by the United States Gov
ernment on the Southern Pacific; these
rates are subject to the terms of the sev
eral acts of Congress granting aid for the
construction of said railroad." Regarding
other contracts, "the Central Pacific Rail
road, the Southern Pacific Railroad and
the Oregon and California Railroad each
received aid in its construction from the
United States and are subject to the r.cts
granting such aid and to certain restric
tions and conditions regarding the trans
portation of freight, passengers and mails.
These acts of Congress constitute contracts
between the railroads and the United
States."
Then follow tabulated, statements on
"security for funded debt"; employes and
salary (15,134, paid $12,333,746 77, ' inclu
ding the pay of 83 officers); passenger,
freight and train mileage; freight traffic
movement; mileage; renewal of rails and
ties.
Tbe list of "accidents to persons" com
prises: Deaths 128, 31 being employes and
:97 passengers and "others" ; injuries 695,
507 being employes and 188 passengers
and "others." Of the pussengers and
others killed 84 were trespassers and 13
not trespassers.

ROMAN CHURCH
AND CIVIL POWER.
Donald M. Ross Cites Author
ities on a Third Propo
sition.
THE TALK GETS WARMER
Doors Will Be Thrown Open
To-Night and the Books
Presented.
WILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH.;
The Preacher Says He Has Made Dis
coveries That Will Keep Him
in Combative Mood.
Rev. Donald M. Ross undertook at Met
ropolitan Temrue last evening to prove the \
third of the four propositions which he ai- j
firmed to be a part of the faith-doctrine of
the Catholic Church, and which are de
nied by Rev. P. C. Yorke. The proposition
was that "the Roman church has the
right to exercise its authority without any
limit set to it by the civil powers."
It was announced that to-morrow night
the doors would be thrown open and the !
public invited without cost. Further, that
the books from which the citations have
been made by Mr. Ross, and which cita
tions are charged by Father Yorke to be i
forgeries, will be produced for the examin- i
ation of any and all.
Major E. H. Sherman whom Rev. Mr.
BoaÃ has selected as the lawyer to judge in
his behalf upon the authorities presented,
madca short address reaffirming his state
raenta concerning the hanging of deserters
found righting against the United States ]
at Cherubusco and all of whom he de
clared were Irish Catholics, one of whom
wore a Catholic medal.
Previous to the entrance of Mr. Ross,
G. A. Hubbell stated the conditions of the
contest â that Father Yorke had issued a l
challenge ; Rev. Mr. Ross, being a brave :
man and confident of his premises, had ac- ;
cepted. and now Peter 0. Yorke had in
cowardly fashion taken to the woods.
Tne entrance of Mr. Ross was greeted ;
with prolonged applause, and he entered '
directly upon his task, addressed to the
proposition cited. At its conclusion he '
said: "Now 1 shall piy my respects to Pc- ]
ter C. YorKe." This called forth more
sustained applause.
â¢'ln the morning papers/ he said, "you
will find some poetry over the signature of
l'eter C. Yorke." [Laughter.]
"I shall not refer to that. But in the
â creed above the poetry you will have
noticed that I am called a liar and a
forger. I am glad he has fallen to the
weak argument of cailin^ names. But I
am not a liar nor a forgot; If I were
there is a law whereby 1 might and should !
Le punist.ed. lam not afraid of that law. â 
The court in this case â the lawyers ap
pointed to judge of this issueâ have* seen
all my authorities â the books themselves â j
and they have been amazed an how abso- j
lutely honest I have been in giving the '
full text covering the subject and not a ,
mere disjointed paragraph.
'I have quoted from none but recog
nized textbooks with the stamp of ap- :
proval of the Catholic church. I will have
then textbooks here ta-morrow. Nay,
more. We shall throw our doors open and ;
invite an}- who will to corn* ana examine j
them.
â¢'This Roman church and Peter C. Yorke i
have occasioned, in this matter of accept- |
ing and fulfilling my obligation in accept- |
ing this challenge, "an expense of about !
fGOQ. Peter C. Yorke has, by way of an- â 
swering my arguments Dresented here, i
called me a liar and a forcer. The infamy
of that man I neve r expect to meet in a
human being. How dare he call me a liar
when he has not looked into the textbooks
I quote?
â¢I hope if there be a Roman Catholic
in the audience to-njorrow night he will
examine tftein if he does not demand that
Peter Yorke do so. 1 believe in tne
solemnity of an oath, and 1 am willing to
take my oath to the correctness of my
quotations. My difficulty has not been to
secure authorities but to choose between
them. The books are full of them, and
especially on tne lirst night I had more
than I could read. Mr. Yorke could have
seen my authorities had he desired to do
so. Now, here is one on this marriage ques- |
tion that is absolutely appalling. It is from a
treatise on matrimony by Right Rev. Dr. A mat,
Bishop of Monterey, Cal., pace 2t>:
â¢â¢Nor can any Christian at any time under
any pretext whatever apply to any civil
magistrate or any court whatever for a divorce
of a marriage, validly contracted, for the pur
pose of marrying another, or avail himself of a
divorce previously obtained to get married
ajjain to another. The only exception that
ciists iii thib respect is the one mentioned
above by . v t. Paul in lavor of the Christian
faith when marriage has been contracted by
two inndels or un baptized persons and one of
them after marriage embraces_Lhe Christian
faith: if the unbeliever abandons him or will
not live peaceably with the new convert, this
remains free from the first tie and can get
married to another."
My <Fodl what <iocs that mean to except?
If I wish to leave my wife to-morrow 1 have
only to join the Catholic church. It means,
tt.Â«.-eiore, that now and hitherto I have been
living with her in sin. What an easy way of
getting rid of one wife and of getting another.
Much interest is being manifested now in
just such a case in Canada. It is the first de
cree ot divorce ever recognized by the Catholic
Church. It is granted to John Keith on the
ground of adultery on the part of the wife,
who was a Protestant. Ah, they are bad peo
ple over there. But it happens to bo the
birthplace of Bishop Riordan. 1 believe he
would like to be there just now. And by the
way, I would like to know when and where he
took out his lirst papers. When he was made
Bishop, previous to assuming charge of the
property of the church in the aiocese, he made
uatti that he was an American citizen. I
would liice to know when he became such.
I assure you thai it is no pleasure for me to
perform this work that Peter C. Yorke has
lorced on me. Hut since I have entered upon
it, and alter having found out the things that
1 have found out concerning this church in
the course of my investigations, I assure you
that it is wnr to ihe death.
1 give them notice to-aipht that I shall fight
unlit my death. lam not afraid of them, aiid
a man might as well die with his boots on as
any other way.
If ever a man has been favored by fate â or
whatever it might be calledâ l am that man in
this matter. Some weeks ago 1 sent to Berlin
for an authority on this proposition. I have
lelt as V> ellington is said to have felt at Water
loo praying for Blucher to come up. My'
Blucber arrived to-day. *
la this morning's Call I am charged by
l'eter C. Yorke directly with a forgery of the
syllabus wherein I quote it as saying :
â¢'ln a case of conflict between the ecclesiasti
cal aud civil powers the ecclesiastical ought to
prevail."
Peter Yorke draws upon me what he calls
the deadly parallel and gives as the reading of
ihe original syllabus the following:
"In a conflict between the two powers the
civil law prevails."
Had I not received this book I would have
had some difficulty in answering with author
ity this statement of my adversary. Hut it
came to hand, as I say, to-day. It is a trans
lation not only of the syllabus authorized by
the Pope, bin a translation of the meaning of
the Pope in his denials ol certain propositions.
Hera is the German for it:
'In conflicte dor gazetze belder gewalten
gt-'hi, nicht dass weltlicke sacht vor."
The English of this is: "In conflict of the
laws oi both, the civil law does not prevail."
Does not that settle it?
Now I am free of the whole worldâ perfectly
just and fair to this man who never new fair
ness. lam not afraid of himâ am not afraid
i
of the world in the speaking of what I know to
be the truth.
The address was as follows:
Your Honor, Ladies and Gentlemen: I shall j
attempt this evening to prove that the Roman
Catholic church claims to have the right to ex
ercise its authority without any limit set to it â¢
by the civil powers. You will find this is the
first proposition which Father Yorke denies
and which he asserts 1 CRnnot find in Catholic
publications to be the teaching and dogma of ;
the Roman Catholic church.
Let it be definitely understood to-night
again, as it was last night, that I am not as-
Berlins or attempting to prove that the Roman '
Catholic church is wrong in claiming to have
the right to exercise its authority without any
limit set to it by civil powers.
In that textbook on marriage which bears
upon its iace the nihil obstat of the censor
(U-putatus of the prouagauda in Rome we find j
these words:
'â¢This is why St. Thomas calls it (marriage) a
spiritual contract; and from this it follows
that the secular power, which can annul other i
perfectly valid contracts, and supplement
under certain conditions the consent of the I
contractors, can do nothing and shall never
be able to do any such thing when it is a ques- ,
tion of marriage." Marriage 91.
Here the Roman Catholic church asserts and
claims that in the realm of marriage, which is
world wide and falls within the boundaries of
every Government, the civil powers can do ,
nothing and shall never be able to do anything
effecting legislation on marriage. If that is
nut an assertion that the church has the right
to exercise its authority without uny limit set
to it by any government on earth, I do not
understand language.
In "Elements of Ecclesiastical Law" we find
under the title of "Rights of the parish priests
in regard to sacraments of matrimony" the |
following: "Whenever the Tridantine l)ecree
Tarnetsi is published, marriage, in order 10 be
valid, must be contracted in the presence of
the priest who is in the parish in which one or
both of the parties live.'"
"The Holy Council of Trent, session 24, en
joined that marriages on pain of their in
validity, are to be celebrated in the presence j
of the parish priest and two or three wit
nesses."
Here again we have in the plainest terms
the Roman Catholic church claiming absolute :
right over the question of matrimony.
Father Schouppe says in a work which he
published on religious instruction and which Â°
is also authoritative:
"The church," says Pius IX, "is a real and j
perfect society, entirely free, enjoying the dis- I
linctiye perpetual rights which were conferred i
upon it by its divine founder."
When an organizanon claims to be perfect ;
within itself aud to be entirely free from every i
other jurisdiction, it lays claim to the right to \
exercise its authority without any limit set to !
it from without.
In Bronson's review we read:
"At bottom, then, the question is simply a |
question of the rights and prerogatives of the
spiritual order in the face ot the temporal, i
That order we have found to be by its own |
nature independent and supreme. Every i
Christian, every moralist, every man does and !
must concede it, however by so doing he may j
reflect on bis own practice. If, then, that order
be presented on earth In its plenitude by the ,
Pope, lie must necessarily be independent and
supreme in face of the representatives of the :
temporal order ;tthat is, in face of the secular j
authority, the prince or the state."
Here the writer says that the church is inde- i
pendent and supreme, and goes on with a
claim to assert that every Christian and every '
moralist and every man does and must con
cede it.
Cardinal Manning says:
"The Catholic Church is the highest and
final judge of what is the faith aud what is the i
law of God, and when science and politics I
come into conflict with the faith and the law |
it admits of no appeal from its own decision to i
any tribunal out of itself, to any judge of ap- j
peal in the past or in the future."
What is the meaning of the language? It j
admits of no appeal from its own jurisdiction j
to any tribunal.
Am'at, late Bishop of Monterey, a good au
thofity on the Pacific Coast, a man having a
local Habitation and name among us, says:
"The church of her own authorityâ that is to
say, independently of any civil power or magis
trate, but only by virtue of the power she re
ceived from her divine founderâ can enact !
laws concerning Christian marriages, regulat
ing their contract and attesting tneir lawful
ness and validity, which no other laws can do,
by whatever magistrate or authority they may !|
be enacted, unless approved and sanctioned
by the same."
Here the assertion is made that the church
independently oi any civil powor can enact
laws. Is not" that exercising the right of
authority without any limit set to it ?
"In any question as'to the competence of the
two powers either there must be some iudgo to :
decide what does and what does not fail with- !
in their respective sphere or they are delivered
ovor to perpetual doubt and toperjetual con
flic.. â¢ â¢ â¢ But if the church be certain
with a divine certainty as to the limits of its
jurisdiction Its voice in such matters isfinaL.
Bui an authority that can al'no define the
limits of its own office is absolute because it
depends on none, and infallible because it
knows with a divine certainty the faith which
it has received in charge."
What is the meaning of the words? Its voice i
in such matters is final. If it does not convey !
to the mind of every man the idea that that j
organization claims to be independent of any '
and every tribunal on earth then it means '
ucthinjt. *
Father Schouppe says in his work on religious
instruction:
"Since the power of the church is divine it â 
follows;
"That it is of an order which is superior to '
all human power.
'That it is distinct from, though not opposed j
to, civil authority, of wnich it is entirely in- ;
dependent."
Here tne teaching of the church is that it is
entirely independent of civil authority. Any i
organization, let it be church or let itbenatiori, i
whlcn claims to be entirely independent of all j
other authority, must claim the right to exer- j
cisc its own authority without any limitation
whatever.
In "Elements of Ecclesiastical Law" we
read:
'Civil laws derive all their force, so far as
they are applicable to ecclesiastical matters, !
solely from the authority of the church."
"The church is secondly a perfect and in- ',
dependent society. * * * A society is inde
pendent when it is not subject to the authority
of any other society. â¢ â¢ â¢ The church, there
fore, is not subject to civil authority, but en
tirely independent of it."
Here we learn that the canon law of thÂ°
church holds that the church is independen !
of the state. Americans ought to know the
line of independence, and an American knows
by the word independence is meÃnt none
other than that the organization claiming it
exercises its authority without any limit.
"No other power (but the Pope), whether
civil or ecclesiastical, can dispense with or re
peal in part the universal law of the church.
Not the civil power as is evident."
Here again the teaching and practice of tno
church are that no power whatsoever can
touch or invalidate or affect the law of the
church.
In the postulation drawn up by Archbishop
Spauldlng during the Vatican Council of 1870
we find these deiinitions:
"That no appeal from the Sovereign Pontiff
Is lawful.
"That every Christian is bound to give these
decisions interior assent and not merely re
spectful silence.
"That these decisions of the Pope are not
less sovereign in the declaration of dogmatic
laets than in determination of pureiy doctrinal
questions."
When a society or law-making body claims
that no appeal can be had from it, does it not
claim the right to exercise its authority with
out any limit set to it by the civil powers?
In the "Elements of Ecclesiastical Law,"
which by the way is the textbook on canon
law used in Archbishop Riordan's courthouse
when trials of priests, nuns or laymen are
there held, we read:
"Civil society has no jurisdiction in matters
which relate primarily and directly to the pri
vate utility cf the faithful, taken individually."
Here the assertion is made that in matters
involving even persons within the circle and
circumference of the churcn the civil law
cannot enter, and if the civil law cannot enter
there the church claims the right of unlimited
authority within that circle.
1 am gome to read to you a number of very
Important citations from the great Cardinal
Manning. And, by the way, let me turn aside
for a moment here to remark that when a
Protestant layman or clergyman passes over
into the Catholic church he is quoted in that
church and looked upon in that church as a
great and good man and shining light. But
when a priest dares to change from the com
munion of the Catholic church to that of the
Protestant church he is looked upon as a sort
of soiled dove. A Newman ana a Manning
may go over to the Catholic church and we do
not assert that they are soiled and degraded
because they see fit to chanpe 'heir minds, ana
even change the vow they made to the com
munion in which they then believed. But
when a priest of the Catholic church lite
Father Chiniquy or Father HyaHnthe or Dr.
Vanolli. who has but the other day come out
not only frem the priesthood but from the
Propaganda in Rome, and who is now in
New 'iorkâ when a priest leaves the Catholic
church we believe he is as pure a man, as hon
orable a man, as unsoiled a man as when he
was in that communion. And when the priests
of the Catholic church blackguard and vilify
and calumniate every priest who comes out o"f
the Catholic church we believe that the dirt is
left behind in th<; Catholic church.
If a Luther comes out ot the church every
catechism will teach that Luther is a fallen
man.
"The church claims to be the sole (because
divinely appointed) judge of the sphere of its
own spiritual office, authority and jurisdic
tion. * â¢ Â« To concede or to abdicate this
supreme spiritual office would be to the church
death. â¢ â¢ â¢ It is for this that St. Thomas of
Canterbury died. â¢ * * It is for this that
the Archbishop of Posen has also declared his
readiness to die."
When the church claims to be the sole iuage
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1896.
of the sphere of its office, authority and juris
diction, is it not asserting its right to exercise
its authority without any limit set to it by the
state?
"The church having a divine liberty as the
witness which God has constituted in the
world to deliver his revelation, and being the
sole fountain of that knowledge, has within its
sphere a sovereignty, and that sovereignty is
one wliich is exempt from all control of human
authority. No authority on earth can inter
vene to dictate to the church what it has to
teach or within what limits it shall teach.
â¢ * * It is therefore not .only exempt, but
supreme, and being supreme there can be no
appeal from it."
Cardinal Wanning here states that the
church and its authority and sovereignty is
exempt from all control of human authority.
Plainer language cannot be found In which
Rome could claim its right to exercise its
authority without auy limit set to it by the
civil powers. And when the church claims
that no authority on earthâ kingdom, empire
or republic â can intervene to dictate to it
what it shall teach or within what limits it
shall reach, that church declares and teaches
that all right of authority within it rests with it.
"I will draw out a proof that nltrauiontanism
and Catholicism ore identical." But just pre
viously he said: "This is ultramontanism;
the essence of which is that the church, being
a divine institution and by divine assistance
infallible, is, within its own sphere, Independ
ent of all civil powers; and as the guard and
interpreter of the divine law it is the proper
judge of men and nations In all things touch
iug that law in faith and morals."
The same writer again claims even
stronger that the church is within its own
sphere independent of all civil powers.
Again Manning says:
"Home is sovereign because it is independent;
it is independent because it has no master on
earth. The vicar of Jesus Christ is the source
of its liberty, the guardian of ita sovereignty.
Call it temporal power if you will, the thing is |
the same â the freedom, the Independence, the
sovereignty of the kingdom of God on eartn,
in all the world and over all mankind, resting
upon its center in the patrimony of the
church, within which the shadow of no other i
sovereignty can intrude without a violation
of the supernatural order of grace. 1 '
The writer here declares that within the
church not even the shadow of any other sov
ereignty can intrude without doing wrong.
Dollinger, whose learning and truthfulness
in history not Yorke, nor Riordan, nor the
Hayes-street fortress can impeach, says:
"According to the Jesuit representation the
church is a great all-embracing empire, an ab
solute monarchy, ruled with irresponsible and
plenary power by one man, the Pope. To him
all alike, laymen and cleric, king and beggar,
are equally'and absolutely subject."
"This papal kingdom must be upheld and ex
tended by all means of compulsion and vio
lence and punishments of life and limb, some
times directly inflicted, sometimes by invoking
the secular arm. wnich is bound at once to exe
cute its sentence."
"We recognize no religious liberty where our
church is not free in her doctrine, discipline or
worship, and where all men have not full and
entire freedom to profess the Catholic religion
without restraints from or responsibility to any
human power whatever, whether vested in the
king, the aristocracy or the people. * â¢ â¢
This freedom we demand, not as a favor, not as
a grucious concession from the prince or the
repuolic, but as the right of our church."
What construction would Father Yorke put
upon the language, "without restraint from or
responsibility to any human Dower whatever."
Does not an organization that claims the right
to be without restraint or responsibility claim
that it has the right to exercise its authority
without any limit set to it by civil power;;
The "Elements of Ecclesiastical Law," page
227, reads as follows :
'â U. Is it allowable to>ppeal!to the civil power
or seek redress in the civil courts against
wrongs inflicted by ecclesiastical superiors?
"A. Such appeals are, as a rule, not only un
lawful but null and void. â¢ * * For the
church being a perfect and supreme society
and, therefore, sole and ultimate judge in mat
ter- pertaining to her jurisdictionâ i. c., eccle
siastical and spiritual things. The civil power
so far from having any power over the church
in this respect is itself subject to her. * * * I
In no case, therefore, la it allowed to appeal to j
the civil courts from the decisions of the Holy
iree."
This question and answer simply sums
up the whole thing into this: That the civil
law, even when it renders a decision, is not
binding and need not be obeyed.
How can a government prosper, how can
courts of law he maintained when an element '
organized together assert that the voice, of the I
law is no belter than the breath of the wind?
The law of the church even goes further and
asÂ»erts that in no case, under no circumstances, !
can the jurisdiction of the church be brought
to the notice of the civil court.
Jouin, in a work which has the approval of
the Propaganda, says:
"The church, being aÂ»society instituted by
God with the object of leading mankind to
salvation, must, in all things belonging to her,
be independent of civil society, as we stated
above.
"So law of any state, framed in opposition
with her teaching, can be binding on the con
science of m.iv ; because .-uch a law is opposed
to the law of God, and we must obey God rather
than man."
Here within the sphere of the church a
declaration is made that the church in all i
things belonging to her is independent of civil j
society.
"The power of kings," said Pius IX. repeat
ing the words of Pope St. Innocent and St.
Felix, "was instituted, not only for the gov- |
eminent of the worid, but for the assistance of
the church; and nothing is more glorious or
more advantage his to a prince than to
leave the Catholic church in possession i
of her own rights and to allow \
none to interfere with her liberty. By virtue
of her power 01 the ministry the church ad
ministers all sacraments, not excepting mar
riage, of which she is sole judge, with full
power to create invalidating impediments or
to dispense with them. By the same faculty
she grants indulgences, institutes feasts, regu
lates ihe ceremonies of the holy sacrifice and
all that constitutes public worship."
To-morrow evening we shall have here on
the platform the authorities from which all
these citations have been taken. I have not
taken advantage of your confidence in me to
quote a single syllable that is not found in
Catholic publications. To-morrow evening I
shall not only produce the proofs to sustain
the third proposition, but I shall summarize
before you the substance of the lectures
preceding. _____^_

came back from Tacoma she said that the
whole family was sick. Her testimony was
the same as that of Mrs. Tunnell. I never
suspected there was anything in the sickness
of Miss Overman that needed to be suppressed.
! Miss Overman never made a confident of me.
She came here with Mrs. Thurston. When
Mrs. Tunnell left my house the last time
she left no instructions for the dispo
sition of letters, papers, etc. I Rtill have
two family letters addressed to Mrs. Tunnell in
my possession. I have no knowledge whatever
j of her whereabouts. She may have gone to
| Oentrai America to her son Byron. In
j August, 1895, I sent for Mrs. Tunnell to come
to my house to stay with my mother during
my absence. She was here a day, when .Miss
Overman came over also.
Mrs. Eaton's mother, being duly sworn,
testified as follows:
I know Mrs. Tunnell and Miss Overman. I
was here alone, and Mrs. Eaton going away
wrote a note to Mrs. Tunnell to come and stay
with me. She came a few minutes before mv
daughter left. I said: "I thought you wouldn'"t
come. I always had confidence in you." She
gave as the excuse for her deUy that she was
invited to meet Mattie, and she didn't meet
her at the boat, therefore she was late.
Mattie came and stayed two nights. She
looked feeble and weak. Mrs. Tunnell said
"I thought I would bring Mattie over here
where it is pleasant and quiet that she might
recuperate. ' She stayed until Sunday. On
that day they went to church. That was
during the last part of August. I never saw
Dr. Brown before to-day. I had no conversa
tion with them about these matters because
there were no rumors afloat at this time.
Mary Wirts, the niece of Mrs. Eaton, being
duly sworn, testified as follows:
In answer to the question, "What did Mrs.
Tunnell say about leaving Dr. Brown's house?"
she replied, "I heard her say Dr. Brown and
Mattie said if I couldn't stand up to get out.
I happened in the room when Mrs. Tunnell
made this remark to Mrs. Eaton. That is all I
| heard Mrs. Tunnell say about the matter. She
j did not discuss affairs before me at all. I did
not know Miss Overman."
At the conclusion of its reading the
council adjourned until to-day at 2 p. m.

and resulted in the inglorious defeat of
the even-money favorite, Wheel of For-
tune. With but 104 pounds in the saddle,
Harvey's mare was considered a "pipe"
by the talent and was plunged on when
her odds reached 7 to 5. Stable money
forced the odds against Rosebud down
from 3 to 2VÂ£, but later the Tv rant mare
receded to 3J^. A consistent play kept
Cabrillo's odds at 4. Red Glen, Agitato
and Mollie X, the other starters, had a
scant following.
The race could hardly be called a true
run one. The boys all seemed to have
waiting orders, and as the turn down the
back stretch was readied Chorn on the
favorite passed Agitato, taking the lead,
followed by Rosebud. The first half was
covered in fifty-two seconds, with the
"Wheel" a length before the second
choice. There was little chance in posi
tions as the stretch was reached, the favor
ite apparently having the race well in
hand. Below the lurlong pole, however,
Rosebud moved up, ana Chorn on the
"Wheel" was seen to be urging his mount.
She responded gamely, but was easily out
footed to the wire. Rosebud winning very
handily by a scant length. Cabrillo came
fast atthe end with a great showing of
speed, finishine a close third. The win
ner's time was 1:41%. Bergen, who rode
Cabrillo. came in for much adverse criti
cism, as he apparently laid out of the race
altogether 100 far, until too late to win.
There were no startling performances to
record. The favorites were successful on
but two essays, second choic. s and out
siders taking the other events. The num
ber of pencilers was lessened by them at
yesterday's cut-in, and those above the
"dead line" did a fairly profitable busi
ness.
The racing opened with the usual "doe"
dash at five and a half furlongs, of which i
there have been such an abundance of late '
Oeorge C, the Z\i to 1 second choice, car
ried off the laurels, downing the 150 to 1
shot, imp. Alien, in a drive. Landlord,
the favorite, ridden by Cash Sloan, lin
lshea third.
A more perfect start is rarely seen than
t he one in the two-year-old event, a balf- !
mile spin, with thirteen starters. With
scarcely a noticeable delay the barrier flew
in the air and they went away on even j
terms. The 3 to b favorite * Greyhurst '
almost immediately took the lead, and !
under restramst the vrhole way won as lie
pleased from St. Dtmstin. Philip H, a 100
to 1 shot, was a good third.
The Elkton stables' jumper, J O C,
shows returning form, and captured tho
steeplechase over the short courae at the
very remunerative odds of Bto 1. Taking
the lead from Gold Dust before the stretch
was reached :.e won handily, trailed by
the hrst choices in the betting, Cicero and
Mestor.
The "Kansas City Hindoo," George Mil
ler, came out fresh and full of run in the
short six-furlong run, adding still another
winning bracket to his long list of victo
ries. He had a slight call over Gratify in
the ring, going to the post Bto 5. Easel
and Morven set a merry pace to the stretch,
when Coady gave the favorite his head
and, taking command, won cleverly by
naif a length from Ed Kearney, who came
fast at the end. Gratify was unplaced.
Another "Dice-box Derby" at live and a
half furlongs for maidens ended the day's
sport, furnishing the charitably inclined
of the crowd an opportunity to help the
suffering booky even up any losses he
may have incurred during the" day. Imp
-VJnppina, San Marco, Montaliade and
Mirambo carried all the coin wagered and
v one T , of â  them, Mirambo, managed to

In all of the races run over the main

The management of Ingleside Track has
had a starting gate set up on the inside
course, with a man stationed in charge of
it, for the accommodation of owners that
wish to school their horses in the art of
quick breaking. *
Hugtiey Jones was at a loss to account
for the poor showing Gratify made in the
race won by George Miller." The chestnut
youngster has been doing well and in his
preliminary warming-up gallop tripped
through the stretch in 23}$ seconds,
faster than he has ever worked before.
Hughey bet a good chunk of coin on him,
as well as all oi>his friends. Grannan un
loaded to the extent of $5500.
There is a possibility of Rosebud, Wheel
of Fortune and Cabriilo coming together
again in a three-cornered match over the
same distance and with the same weights
up ass carried in yesterday's race. At one
of the downtown hotels last night where a
group of horsemen had collected talking
over the day's racing, Joe Harvey insinu
ated that he did not think â¢'The" Wheel"
showed at her best and was willing to back
it up with $2500. One of Cabrillo's sup
porters, who thor.ght Bergen rode an all
timed race, was willing to furnish the same
amount for that horse, and if the owners
of Rosebud think their mare can repeat
the trick the association could no doubt be
induced to give some added money. The
event would certainly prove a great draw
in" card.
Philip H, a fine-looking brown -colt, by
the Australian sire Loyalist, made an ex
cellent showing in the two-year-old event.
He finished a strong third, and will un
doubtedly be a dangerous customer when
the distances are stretched out. Loyalist
is owned by Eddie Sachs, who leased him
to the Palo Alto stock farm, where he is
doing stud service.
The few of the get of Racine that have
appeared so far this season have created a
very favorable impression. A daughter of
his, Jessie Bartlett Davis, finished a good
fourth in the two-year-old race yesterday.
April was reported to be a sick horse,
and why his owner, "Honest" Dodd,
started him in the steeplechase is a mys
tery. He was beaten a hundred leagues.
Imp. Agrippina, one of the favorites in
tne last race, was away from the post well,

TO REV. ROSS.
Calls the Temple Lecture
Course a Comic Per
formance.
FREE CHURCH AND STATE
A Claim That the First Proposi
tion in Question Has Been
Twisted.
TERMED ANOTHER FORGERY.
The Chancellor Takes Sherman, the
A. P. A. Judge, Viaorously to Task
on His Record.
The following letter has been received
by The Call :
To the Editor of The Can -Dear Sir: D.
Ross still continues his comic performance at
the Metropolitan Temple. The faithful few
who love to be humbugged at two-bits the
humbug have grown alarmingly fewer, and the
temperature reminds one of Dr. Nansen and
the north pole.
D. Ross devoted himself this evening to the
first tiro portion. As usual, he made no at
tempt to produce the publication from which
he claimed to read last November. Of course,
there is no such publication, and when Donald
pretended to read from it he was guilty of stat
ing the thing that is not.
But perhaps he has proven the substance of
the proposition. Let us see. It runs as fol
lows:
"The Romish church has a rignt to exercise
its authority without any limit set to it by the
civil powers."
This means that the Catholic church claims
that its authority is unlimited. Civil govern
ments have no rights before it. What the
church says goes. It does not matter what the
church may say or how it may use its author
ity the civil power can do nothing but step
aside.
This proposition and the ethers which ac
company it were read by I). Rosa and spread
broadcast by the organization of foreigners
which employs him. The distribution of
them -was intended to give the unthinking the
idea that the church claimed unlimited au
thority in America. Such an idea is utterly
erroneous and Ross knew it when no read
these alleged quotations.
The present proposition has a history similar
to that of the others already discussed. The
nineteenth proposition of the syllabus runs as
follows:
. :' " â¢â¢ LATEST. ENGLISH.
XIX. EcdeslanOD eal The church is not a true
â¢ vera perfectaque socletas and perfect society, en
plane libera, nee pollet tirely free, and she does
sals, propriis et eonstan- not enjoy her proper and
tibus juribus sib! a dl- perpetual rights given her
vino suo fundatore colla- by her divine founder:
tis, sod clvihs potestatis bnt it pertains to the civil
est ' ilfflnlre. qua- .;.: power to define what are
ecclegise jura ac limites the rights Of the church
. in'.ra quos eadem jura and the .limits within
exerbere quew. which the .-,ame rights
can be exercised.
The Catholic church teaches that she Â»as
rights over spiritual things, which rights were
given her by Jesus Christ. With these rights the
state cannot interfere. It is not the state's busi
ness to define -whet the constitution of the
church should be, what her beliefs should be,
what herspiritual laws should be. A free church
In a free state is the Ideal of Catholics as well as
of the AmericanÂ«people. The church has one
sphere and the state has another sphere. The
truest bond of union between the two powers
â â 5 that each should attend Eirictly to its own
business. .
V. -a-, "'Ross takes this proposition of the sylla
bus hiici twist* it around. Again let me put in
pareUel : colunins the original and the forgery:
V XlX..': The church is XIX. The Romish
â¢ no: a tfui>-ar.d perfect church has a riant to -x
djqijr-. entirely free, and lercise us authority wlth

â  pjjwer 10 define what are
the r,glus of the church
and : jne limits within
.'Â» : n;e& the- 'same rights
cÂ»nbg eiercised. .
It is evident to any man of common-sense
(hat-- both these propositions are false. The
church has no right to exercise its authority
outside- its own sphere. This is a truism
which every Catholic schoolboy knows. Only
ministers of the gospel who strive to make a
living by spreading hate and by uttering
forgery would countenance such a vile misre
presentation as the first proposition of Donald
Ross.
I remark. Mr. Editor, that Sherman, the un
biased judge, renews his statement that Booth
had a medal on him when shot. Again I brand
that statement as a falsehood. The records of
the trial show what was on the body of Booth
and there is no mention of a medal.
Another point. Sherman made the assertion
that he was present at Churubusco. I should
like to have some other authority for that than
the word of "the most conscienceless liar from
the Yukon to Terra del Fuego." I have
searched the official records of tne Mexican
War for Sherman's name, and as yet I nave
not been able to find it. OT course, it is pos
sible that he may have been there. The re
ports do not usually mention the sutlers.
The Rev. Ross grows quite pathetic over the
expenses to which he was put and the sad in
difference of the "friends" to his welfare. Let
me say once more that the circus at Metropoli
tan Temple was Ross' own affair. If he had a
good cause the verdict of three non-Catholic
lawyers would have been as glorious a vindi
cation as man could wish for. He would have
stood as high in the public estimation after
fuch a verdict as he is now low in the public
contempt. But he thought he had an oppor
tunity of making money as well as of gaining
fame," and tho people of San Francisco have
shown that they are still able to take the mea
sure of a mountebank.
To-morrow night he hopes to humbug for
nothing those he has not been able to humbug
for two bits. He offers to produce his provi
dentially sent books, in the original German,
to all - who care to examine them. Permit me
to gay that he would show more confidence in
his case if he would submit these books to the
scrutiny of three non-Catholic lawyers as I de
manded. Then it would become evident how
he has maneled his quotations and doctored
them to lit his case. It would become evident,
too, thai the word forger which appears to
â¢worry him so is the only word in the diction
ary, obsolete or not, which fits his case.
In conclusion let me state that my descrip
tion of Sherman as a fou.'-mindul and foul
tongued old reprobate is well borne out by
his incoherent address of to-night. He is not
only a liar, but is a dirty liar. Yours truly,
. â  P. C. YORKE.
COSTLY DUMMY BUNDLES
The Stock-in-Trade of the Ex-
German- American Laun
dry.
G. P. Rochel and Six Olher Victims
Cause the Arrest and Trial of
Fred Albrecht.
Tweive jurymen spent a pleasant and
tive afternoon yesterday in Judge
-' courtroom.
They are men thoroughly unbiased or
unprejudiced in regard to laundries or
yineii; men, in. fact, who have never
known what it is tomi3sa button oh a
lr-band or to get a nightshirt stiffened
arch.
Itani District Attorney Walter lim
lÂ£ie deserves the credit of getting this flock
)f the rara avis together, and he took par
iCilar delight, after impaneling them, to
put them through the kindergarten course
aearly all the rest of the world was taught
uiu ajgo.
It was m the case of Fredr-riuk Albrecht,
who was indicted by the Grand Jury on
tui-'ust 30, 1806, on a charge of obtaining
â¢aoney by false pretenses.
Attorney Hinkle. who has run the
gamut in the prosecution of such cases,
explained that it differed from the otlier
swindles only that it was "clean cut,
laundned and highly polished; the vic
tims of the defendant being done up in
the most approved style."
From the testimony given at the trial
yesterday and the side talk of the
men who were called to court to give their
testimony and who will only be put on
the stand to-day, the case certainly is a
peculiar one.
Gh P. Rochel is the complaining witness.
He is backed Dy M. Veit, P. H. "Peterson,
John Peltier. R. Schruitt, Isaac Jessup
and Ellis Jones, men who are virtually
unknown to tach other, but who with
few minor details claim to have the same
grievances under which Rochel is fretting.
"Without entering into the merits of the
case there are some features which came to
light in the testimony and otherwise, yes
terday, which were amusing to the fury
and to the hangers-on about the court.
The main proposition is that Albrecht
caused Rochel to give him $200 for 2UO
shares of the German-American Laundry
Association, incorporated. It was repre
sented that the institution was a tremen
dous affair with a main office at Lombard
ana Gongh streets, and branch offices all
over the City.
Rochel, it" appear.? from his testimony,
was first offered 100 shares of the 16,000
capital stock for $100, and when he opened
his purse his alleged swindler saw there
was another $100 there. He therefore
promptly offered his proposed victim addi
tional inducements in order to obtain the
coin. Rochel was offered the superinten
dency of the Mission-street branch at a
salary of $12 per week. Rochel immedi
ately parted with his entire $200.
He went to work the next day at 717
Mission street and for two consecutive
days he stood behind the counter waiting
for customers to come in and call for the
bundles of linen piled eight rows high in
the back. He waited in vain and was be
ginning to despair when Albrecht came to
him with instructions to go off to South
The Barkentine Discovery, Which Is Supposed to Have Gone Down With All llands.
[Drawn by a "CalV artist from a painting.]
San Francisco to breaks fractious horse,
which would soon be needed in the busi
ness, which, he said, was building up
rapidly in the main office at Lombard and
Gough streets.
Rochel was away two weeks in his dorse
breaking experience, nearly fracturing his
backbone and a limb or two. In the mean
time M. Veit, a young- German, was Al
brecht's victim.
The inducements offered him were i
identical with those offered Rochel, but |
Veit was of a more inquiring frame of j
mind. He was left alone in the Mission- >
street shop, and he had nothing to do
better than looking into the bundles
parked up on the shelves. Instead of
clot. .es, he found they were packed with
old papers and rubbish.
Rochel ventured in town from his horse
breaking expedition, and he and Veit
compared notes, which resulted in the two
calling on Albrecht and demanding back |
their money. Instead of coin Albrecht j
gave them some sound advice to never go |
into any business with which they were
not familiar.
He laughed at their discomfiture and
told them to "never mind a little thing
like that. Thero will be more suckers
along very soon,"- he said, "and we'll
make it all right."
Rochel placed the matter before Attor
ney Hinkle, who speedily got Albrecht in
dicted by the Grand Jury.
J}ut prior to the Rochel and Veit cases
it appears Albrecht ran foul of a victim
who proved somewhat of a Tartar. It was
Isaac Jessup, a man of some means, who
desired to purchase an interest in some
business for his younger son. Mr. Jessup
paid Albrecht $300, purchased some ma
chines for the purpose of conducting a
laundry, and installed his son in the Mis
sion-street branch.
The lad soon realized that his father had
been swindled and told him so. The old
gentleman "jumped" Albrecht. who, find
ing himself hard pressed, promised to give
back the money he had received. But ho
was short of cash just then, and the best
he could do was to give his personal note
for $350 and a chattel mortgage on all the
German-American Laundry Association's
property.
While Mr. Jessup was thus the sole pro
prietor, Albrecht kept on selling stock in
the corporation on the rood front made by
the rows of dummy clothes bundles on
the shelves of the Mission-street branch.
The other victims of Albrecht and his
one-man corporation will be heard to-day
in Judge Bahrs' court.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 87, 1896.
IS THE DISCOVERY LOST?
Captain and Crew Are Supposed
to Have Gone Down
With Her.
LITTLE HOPE ENTERTAINED.
The Master Was to Have Been
Wedded When the Barkentine
Reached Port.
The barkontiue Discovery has' at last
been given up for lost. > On several occa
sions items referring to'iier long passage
and general unseaworthiness have ap
peared in the papers, but there was always
a hope held out that she might turn up.
The vessel is now out thirty-seven days
from Port Gamble, and in view of the fact
that half a dozen storms have raged along
the coast during that period the chances
are that she has gone to the bottom with
all hands. "We have not given up all
hope even yet," said J. Kentfield, the man
aging owner of the Discovery, '"but I must
admit the chances are against the vessel
ever showing up. She was a very fast
sailer and thirty-six days is an unusually
long trip even for a slow vessel."
The barkentine Discovery sailed from
Port Gamble on January 20 last with the
following crew aboard: Captain, C. Chris
tiansen; first mate, J. Hanson; second
mate, Ole Thornsen; cook, Peter Nelson,
and seamen Alf Peterson. Thomas Scull,
Peter Neyiand, Peter Severtsen, Edward
Larsen and Martin Petterson. From that
day to this neither vessel nor crew have
ever r>een heard from.
On the sth inst. the bark Matilda arrived
at Port Townsend and the captain reported
that the day before he had passed through
a quantity of small broken lumber forty
miles west of Cape Flattery. In describ
ing the scene the skipper said the sea was
covered for .miles with floating timbers of
all sizes. "Evidently," added the captain,
"some" lumber vessel must have met with
disaster." The .-supposition is that Captain
Christiansen, after clearing Flattery, ran
into a heavy gale. His ship being "ten
der," he was afraid to face it, and attempt
ed to put about. In doing so the Discovery
became disabled, and being structurally
weak, .^oon went to pieces. The crew could
do nothing with the boats, and if the
barkentine is gone all hands went with
her.
The lumber cargo of the Discovery was
owned by Pope it Talbot, and that firm is
satisfied that the wreckage passed by the
Matilda was fron the barkentine.
"To make matters look even worse than
they are," said a ship captain yesterday,
"the C. B. Kenny made the run in a little
over a. week, and the Dashing Wave, wliich
left two days after the Discovery, came
down in twelve or thirteen days. The
Discovery nearly always made the run
under two weeks, and now that she is out
over five weeks I would not give much for
her chances."
The Discovery was built at Port Discov
ery in 1874 and has been one of the most
successful coasters trading in and out of
San Francisco, >' ; he was always a fast ves
sel, but all the captains who commanded
her considered her â¢ < ten>!er" â that is, a
vessel that could not be depended upon
during a severe cale. This fact is another
nail in hercoilin according to shipmasters.
This was to have been Captain Chris
tiansen's last voyage as a bachelor. He
was engaged to bo married to a young lady
from Tacoma on bin return to" ifan Fran
cisco, and she is now awaiting him here.
No matter what anybody else thinks she
lias not given up hope, and m every
barkentine that is reported she vainly
looks for the Discovery. Captains who
know the young lady well refuse to di
vulge her name, saying that matters are
bad enough as tiny are without parading
her name and he 1 sorrow in the papers.
Peter Neison, the cook, had also decided
to leave the barkrntine when she arrived
at this port. Wh'-m he was paid off last
trip he decided to? seek another vessel, but
Captain Christiansen overpersuaded him
and he agreed UÂ» make "just one more
voyage." The otfcer members of the crew
were vrell known in San Francisco, and
several of them were members of the
Sailors' Union.
NOT FOND OF DOCKERY
Marin Dairymen File Complaints
Against the Milk In
spector.
Longfellow School May Open on Mon
day Next â The Water-Front
Question Postponed.
The dairymen of Marin County whose
milk was recently dumped into the bay by
Milk Inspector Dockery are very much in
censed against the inspector and have ad
dressed communications to the Board of
Health, supported by affidavits, charging
him with having violated tne ordinance
under which he is given authority to in
spect and seize milk and with discrimina
tion toward certain milkmen.
The complaint of W. D. Stephens, pro
prietor of the Ross Valley Dairy, relates to
section 13 of the ordinance, which reads as
follows:
Section 13. The Board of Health and all its
officers, agents and employes i shall have the
right at any time to take a sample of milk
from any person, persons or concern selling or
exposing tor sale or exchanging or delivering
or distributing milk in the V ity * lld County oi
Fraucisco, not exceeding, however, one
tiuart [hereof, such sample to be taken and
sealed in fall View And in the presence of the
person from whom said sample is taken, and
shall then and there furnish to the person
from whom such milk is taken one-half
of such sample hermetically sealed
and shall deliver to the said Board
of Health immediately the sample so taken
hermetically sealed. Such sample shall have
written thereon at the time of the delivery
thereof to said Board of Health the number of
the dealer's permit, and the date of the obtain
ment of the sample, and the name of the per
hou by whom it is taken, and a memorandum
thereof shall be made by the person obtaining
such sample in a book kept for that purpose in
the office of the Board of Health, showing the
name of the owner or drivers from whom, and.
the date when the Fame was taken, and the
number of the dealer's permit.
Mr. Stephens' driver, Philip Shine,
makes affidavit that Inspector Dockery
took the samples and carried them into ii
building out* of bis sight, afterward de
livering to him a bottle containing some
milk, which the affiant was informed was
taken from his wagon.
The driver declares that he could not
tell whether ihe milk delivered to him was
taken from his wagon or not, as the
alleged division was made out of his sijrht
and while no other wagons were being de
tained and examined by the Inspector.
The Inspector then ordered the milk
dumped into the bay, stating that it con
tained a preserving preparation that ren
dered it unfit for human use.
The complaint is also supported by an
affidavit from Manuel Silvera, who shipped
the milk, stating that be placed the milk
on board tne cars at Ignacio station,
Marin County, and that the milk was
absolutely pure and contained uo adulter
ants or foreign matter whatever.
The California Mi!k Producers' Associa
tion also sent in a complaint objecting to
the manner in which the inspector per
forms his duties. The association com
plains that discrimination has been used,
and that- milk from the same ranch and
similar in every respoct was dumped in at
least one instance and passed in another.
The complaint is accompanied by a re
port from Thomas Price & Sons, the chem
ists, who state that tue sample sent them
for analysis â supposed to be vie one given
by Dockery to tiie driver after ordering
the milk vamped as impure â is pure ana
contains no dangerous ingredient 1 ?.
An affidavit from the dairymen who
shipped the milk was appended to the
complaint, stating that the milk sampled
and ordered dumped by Dockery was pure
and contained no preserving compounds
whatever, and that moreover nothing of
that character was ever kept on the ranch.
The Milk Inspectordenies that he sealed
or tested the samples out of sight of the
drivers, except when they refused to leave
their wagons, and affirms that all milk
dumped into the bay was found to con
tain either preserving compounds or other
foreign matter that rendered it unfit for
use. He cays he will bring ample proof of
this.
The matter was referred to the Milk
Committee for investigation.
Owing to the absence of Mayor Sutro
from the meeting of the Board of Health
the reports of the experts who recently
analysed the water from the various
Spring Valley reservoirs were not opened
yesterday, but were laid over until the
next meetine.
Members of the Board of Education
were present to confer with the health
officials in relation to the closing of the
schools and the matter was discussed at
length.
A decision was finally reached to permit
the Board of Education to make tempo
rary repairs by replacing the objectionable
wooden vaults with galvanized- iron
troughs and leave the matter of putting in
new vaults until the summer vacation.
By that time a decision will probably be
reached by the Board of Education
wh'-ther or not the Longfellow School will
\ consolidated out of existence. The re
txurs to the school will probably be fin
ished by Saturday next and it will likely
open on Monday, March 2.
THE MEN WHO BUILD.
Interesting Matters llefore the Carpen.
tcrÂ»' and Joiners' I>iÂ»trict Council.
Several matters of interest to the mem
bers of the local building trades unions
came up last evening at the meeting of
the District Council of Carpenters and
Joiners. The resignation of E. R. John
son as business agent for the carpenters
was formally announced. Johnson will
leave for Alaska on Saturday. C. F.
Schadt. formerly president of the Dittrict
Council, was appointed temporarily to fill
the vacancy. In a few weeks the four car
penters' unions will hold an election.
There are already Beveral candidates for
the position in the neld,a.nda hftt con
test is expected.
A communication was read from Car
penters' Union No. 23, of Berkeley, an
nouncing that on May 1 the members of
that union will demand $3 a day as the
lowebt rate ol wages. The bosses have
been notified of this demand so that they
may make future contracts accordingly.
District Organizer Malsbary has recently
returned from Sacramento, where he has
been doing "missionary work" among the
carpenters of that city. There are no car
penters' unions in Sacramento, but the
journeymen received him with open arms,
Bo he reported to the council last evening'
and there is v movement on foot toward'
the formation of a carpenters' union.-
On March 3 the carpenters and joiners
of that city will hold a mass-meeting for
the purpose of organization. Mr. Malsbary
stated that the Federated Trades of Sacra
mento indorsed his work and will give
great assistance in the movement. As
soon as the carpenters are organized the
working-card system, the eight-hour a
day and the $3 minimum of wages will be
demanded.
The district council is making great
preparations for a grand social reunion
and "smoker" in the temple on the even
ing of March 7. Able speakers will ad
dress the meeting and singing, recitations,
music and free cigars will be among the
other attractions. Non-union men will be'
received as cordially as union men.
In India there is an idea that a lion can
not be induced to attack a prince, or any
scion of a royal house.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Bark Strathdon Docked at
the Union Iron Works for
Repairs.
HARD AT WORK ON THE QUEEN
Harbor Commissioners Will Set Apart
Section 4 for a Free Fruit
Market.
After Tuesday's collision both the Queen
and Strath'don were busy repairing dam
ages yesterday. The bark was taken in
tow early in the day by the tugs Fearless,
Vigilant and Monarch and docked at the
Union Iron Works. There she will receive
a new bowsprit and all the other repairs
necessary. Should the hull show any strain
the cargo will be taken out and the ves
sel placed on the drydock. The repairs to
the Strathdon are being paid for by Good
all, Perkins & Co. This is not an admis
sion of responsibility on the part oi the
company, but simply a desire to act in a
liberal spirit and not unnecessarily delay
a vessel that was ready for sea. While the
bark is being repaired her agents will
draw Â§123 a day demurrage for her deten
tion.
The repairing of the Queen is being
pushed. All the men that can possibly
rind room to work have been put on, and
in consequence the steamer presented a
very different appearance yesterday from
what she did a few hours after the col
lision. All the wreckage has been cleared
away and some of the repairs to the decks
and railings have already begun. Inside
of a fortnight it is hoped to have the
Queen as good as new.
Word was received at the Merchants'
Exchange yesterday that the American
ship Shenandoah had just completed a
trip from San Francisco to New York in
the- remarkably fine time of ninety-seven
days. The voyage is not a record breaker,
but still it is one of the best passages made
in years. Captain Murphy, the com
mander of the Shenandoah, is well known
in San Francisco, and his family live here.
He is a general favorite among shirjping
men, and they will all be glad to hear of
the big ship's smart run.
Misfortune seems to have overtaken the
opposition line of shippers just established
between Philadelphia and San Francisco
at the outset. The William S. Davis,
which was to have been the fimt of the
iine, has been abandoned off Cape Hat
teras and it will be some time before an
other vessel can be secured to take her
place. The Davis was on her way from
Manilla to Philadelphia to load for this
Dort when she ran into a succession of
heavy gules that completely disabled her.
As she was expected to go down at every
moment the crew abandoned her.
The Independent Boarding-masters' As
sociation of San Francisco have issued the
following circular and are spreading it
broadcast on the water front:
For the better government of shipping and
for the protection of ship-owners and seamen,
w<>, the undersigned, independent deep-water
boarding masters, propose to do business at
the following rates and under the following
conditions:
Wages for seamen not to exceed Â£4 per
month ; allotment not to exceed $40.
â¢ Men to be thlpped free of charge to ship and
seamen alike; boating tree.
Watchman to be supplied by this association
free of charge.
It was also resolved not to ship any men
with parties or so-called shipping masters not
in sympathy wiih this association, and ii was
further resolved that we will give good and
sufficient bonds for the fulfillment of our con
tracts.

The old steamer Eastern Oregon, for
merly of the Oregon improvement Com
pany's line, i? to be brought out of her
retirement in Oakland Creek. A few days
ago she was purchased by Charles Nelson,
Lorentz Foard and others for $5000, and
her days as a steamer are now over. The
machinery will betaken out and the hold
cleared out. Then the Eastern Oregon
will be turned into a four-masted
schooner, and it is rumored that the en
gines will be used to equip two new steam
schooners. The Oregon was a twin-screw
steamer, so she had two sets of engines,
both of which can now be utilized.
The steamer George W. Elder is having
considerable trouble in Retting rid of
10,000 cases of kerosene which she brought
down from Portland. Wharlinger George
Dryden would not aliow the stuff to re
main on the wharf over night, so the
Standard Oil Company, to which it be
longs, has been compelled to cart it away
as soon as it was discharged from the
steamer. The wharfinger is only obeying
a State law, which forbids the storing of
coal oil on a wharf, but nevertheless it is
proving very inconvenient to the steamar
ana the owners of the oil.
The whaling bark Lydia is dischargins
150 barrels of whale oil at Main street.
When she went out of commission last
season the oil was kept in as ballast. Now
that she is about to be refitted it is being
taken out, and the bark will start on
another cruise in a few weeks.
The schooner Barbara Heinster is to
have a gasoline engine put in her. This is
on account of a vigorous protest made by
the residents of Bowens lauding. F.
Hayward has a contract to carry all the
lumber produced in that part of the coun
try to San Francisco, and he has been
doing it in sailing vessels. The people
protested and said they wanted quicker
facilities. If some quicker power than
sail was not forthcoming they said they
would build steum schooners and run an
opposition line. Hayward recognized that
they were in earnest, and he at once began
putting gasoline engines in his fleet. The
Monterey, Newark and Barbara Heinster
are already equipped, and on her arrival
hero the El Rio Rev will be laid up to re
ceive her engines. The equipping of the
four schooners will cost over $20,000, but it
is thought that the increased speed and
increased trade will more than recoup the
outlay.
The steamer San Jose will sail for Pana
ma and way ports on Saturday with a big
cargo of general merchandise. Chief En
gineer McLean and Ch ief Assistant Garvey,
who remained over last trip for a rest, will
go out on the vessel in their old positions.
While the schooner R. W. Bartlett
was unloading lumber at Mission
Rock a timber fell on Henry Olsen, a
brother of the captain, and seriously in
jured him. He was taken to St. Mary's
Hospital, where his wounds were attended
to. He will probable be about again in a
few days.
Hereafter the revenue cutters will have
nctning on their sterns except the name.
A great deal of scroll work and a coat-of
arms was on all of them, but all that is to
be removed aDd everything now is to be of
the plainest. All the cutters are to be
whin?, and the work of transforming the
Bear began yesterday. Orders to the above
effect have just arrived from Washington.
The Harbor Commissioners practically
decided yesterday to give section 4 of the
seawall for a free fruit market. There is a
shed on it 500 feet long and 45 feet wide,
ao that there will be room for all. It now
remains lor the Merchants' Association,
the Horticultural Commission and the
fruit-growers to get together and make
the affair a practical success. The Harbor
Commissioners have gone as far as the
law allows them, so nothing more can be
expected from them. President Colnon is
anxious to see the thiug go through and
hopes that the various organizations
namedwill come to an understanding.
NEW TO-DAY.

IS DOCTOR SWEANY acknowledged as San Francisco's
LEADING AND MOST SUCCESSFUL SPECIALIST?
BECAUSE
His reputation has been established by effecting CURES of
CHRONIC DISEASES IN MEN AND WOMEN where other
physicians of acknowledged ability had failed. Diseases
which had reached a stage before which the most skilled and
experienced physicians stood powerless have yielded to hi 3
treatment, and praise and gratitude are received from RICH
and POOR.
RFfflfli-R QTUP and consider aright this unparal-
â  BEflUKfl %$ 1 111 leled and overwhelming testimony.
It means that a cure is effected of every case that is under-
taken.
FACTS ARE STUBBORNTHINGS.
CHRONIC AND WASTING DISEASES
Of the Throat, Lungs, Heart, Stomach, Bowels, Kidneys and
GENITO-URINARY ORGANS have been Doctor Sweany's study
for life. There are cases of this character which, through neg-
lect or improper treatment, are beyond medical aid, but there
are many more given up as hopeless simply because incompe-
tent physicians have failed to effect a cure. This especially
applies to diseases of the BLOOD and the GENITO-URINARY
ORGANS, and Doctor Sweany yearly saves thousands from be-
coming mental and sexual wrecks.
YOUNG, MIDDLE-AGED AND OLD MEN,
If you are suffering from the effects of early indiscretions, ex-
cesses, emissions and unnatural losses, which rob the blood,
of its richness and the body of its animating influences, which
enfeeble the constitution and finally result in Impotency,
Paralysis, Softening of the Brain and Insanity if you are tor-
mented with morbid fear and your days are passed with dis-
tressing thoughts of your disease, if you are unfit for the every
day duties of life, if you have any or all of those symptoms you
are suffering from SEMINAL WEAKNESS, NERVOUS DEBIL-
ITY and their kindred causes.
THE FIRST THING TO DO
In order to get cured is to cast aside all false modesty and
place yourself under the treatment of this noted specialist.
His experience in the treatment of such diseases has been
world-wide. He has cured thousands of others and CAN
CURE YOU.
GONORRHOEA, GLEET, STRICTURE, arid that terrible and
loathsome disease, SYPHILIS, thoroughly and forever cured. â¢
THE POOR, who call at his offices on Friday afternoons,
are welqome to the doctor's valuable services free of charge.
Your troubles If living away from the city. Thousands are
cured at home by means of correspondence and n.edicines
sent them. Doctor Sweany's patients will get all the advan-
tages of experience and travel in Europe with diligent study in
her best Medical Institutions. Letters are answered in ENG-
LISH, GERMAN, FRENCH, ITALIAN, SWEDISH, NORWEGIAN
and DANISH. ;. .
NAMES of patients or their diseases are riot published or
exposed, but there are thousands of testimonials on file in
Doctor Sweany's private office. They are voluntarily given as
true, deep and sincere expressions of gratitude from our mer-
chants, manufacturers, mechanics, farmers, lawyers, laborers
and literary people, who have been cured by him and made
happy. It is a part of judgment and sense to seek Doctor
Sweany first, instead of squandering away time and money
upon the uncertainties of patent medicine and picayune spe-
cialists. .

The pressure ig highest this evening along the

has occurred during the past twenty-four hours I
throughout that portion of California north of San ;

NEW YORK. N. V., Feb. 26.â The market for
stocks was irregular to-day, and in the main prices
were, inclined to weakness. Realization* seemed
to be In order, more particularly in the case of j
the grangers, Louisville and Nashville and certain i
of tii â¢ industrials. The reaction in St. Paul was j
rather disappointing In view of the lane gains In I
net earnings for January. Rock Island -was sold I
down from 745/8 to 73V2 on the reported destruc
tion of the bridge at Rock Island. Baltimore and ;
Ohio was heavy and bro*e to 3134 on liquidations I
by holders who believe that the report of the ex
pert accountant will be very unfavorable. The
real features, however, were Sugar, Leather pre
ferred and Tobacco.
Sugar was exceptionally strong throughout and
rose to 118V-S- The strength of, the stock was nue I
tOthedefeM of the tariff bill in the Senate yester
day, Leather preferred was feverish, and ranged
between HU and 66.%, closing at 653^. The re- I
port was considered favorable. It shows profits of

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 26.â As on yesterday
Liverpool designated an upward course for wheat
prices, so to-day because of an Indifferent action
at that place this market opened easier, and the .
trade exhibited much bewilderment at the situa
tion. Fine weather was reported from all direc
tions, and the movement in the Northwest was
free. Under the circumstances prices were not
strong, and many of yesterday's buyers were not
at all averse to disposing of their property. Re
ceipts In the Northwest were 441 cars against 332
last Wednesday and 335 a year ago. Chicago had
57 cars, and inspected out 110.652 bushels. The
trade was scattering most of the day, â¢ the lpcal
crowd covering some wheat about the middle of
the session, the effect of which was to cause a rally
from the inside quotations. Continental cables
were irregular. Export clearances of wheat and
flour aggregated 351,481 bushels. Slav wheat
opened from 67yÂ»c to 6t>"'ac, sold between 671.4 c
and 66y 2 c. closing at 8646908*4.0. 3,ic under yes
terday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 40
cars.
CORNâ The receipts of corn, 465 cars, while far
less than those of yesterday were still greatly In
excess of the estimate, and taken in connection
with the easier lone of wheat gave an unfavorable
impression to buyers at the opening. The open
ing was lower, and prices continued to rule easy
later. Withdrawals from store were 68,280 bush
els. Liverpool cables were 'id higher. Export
clearances amounted to 257,171 bushels. May
corn opened at 30 3 /ic, sold between 303 iÂ®3(i"/ 8 c
and 30y2@30$'8C. closing at B @3o3ic i 4 @3- 8 c
under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor
row 350 cars.
OATSâ Took part in the general loss of firm
ness. The business was insignificant and afforded
speculators little chance for action. Receipts were
224'ars. There were no withdrawals from store.
May closed Vie under yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts for tomorrow 245 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady; cash, 90y 2 c; May, 91
@9iy 2 c. Receipts were 19 cars.
PROVISIONSâ The same story as 'yesterday
was to be reported in provisions, ilogs were lower
and product simply followed the same course.
ReducÂ«d consumption of hog meat is reported in
explanation of the dullness prevailing in this
market. May pork closed 2Vj(Â«sc lower, May
lard a shade lower and May ribs 2 i/2 c lower.

UNION STOCKYARDS, 111., Feb. 26. â The
arrivals of cattle were light to-day, but the de

receipts of hogs were large, and buyers were dis
posed to hold off. Prices declined 5c to 10c. The
demand for sheep showed a falling off, and as a
consequence prices declined 10c.

Napoleon's Change of Manner.
There was something seriously amiss
with the central riirure. He was often
suilen and morose, often violent and even
hysterical. To calm his nervous agitation
the court physician ordered wnrrn baths,
which he spent hours in taking. Then,
again, he was irregular in his habits, being
often somnolent durihg the daytime, but
as frequently breaking his rest at mitt
night to set the pens of his secretaries
scampering to keep pace with the flow of
his speech. With old friends he was
coarse and severe; even the brutal Ven
damrne confessed that he trembled before
that "devil of a man," while Lannes was
the only human being who still dared to
use the familiar "thou" in addressing his
old comrade. To the face of his generals
the Emperor was merely cold ; behind
their backs he sneered, saying, for in
stance, of Davout that he might give him
never so much renown, he would not be
able to carry it; of Ney that he was dis
posed to ingratitude and turbulence; of
Bessieres, Oudinot and Victor that they
were mere mediocrities. â Professor Sloane
in the March Century.
Misapplied Energy.
"Hiram," said Mrs. Corntossel, "I hate
ter say anything thet ain't exactly good
natured, but it 'pears ter me thet you ain't
makin 1 ez good use o' yer time ez you
might."
"Maudy," was the reply, "I think I'm
doin' pretty pood. I've been doin 1 a good
deal in the way of improvin' my mind
lately."
"That's jes'it, Hiram. They's a hull
lot er folks in the agricultural perfession
thet keeps puttin' improvements on their
minds when they orter he puttin' repairs
on the farm." â Washington Star.

BOY BURGLARS'
FLAT DENIALS.
Mrs. Willmore on Trial
for Receiving Stolen
Money.
LITTLE INA IN COURT.
Abe Majors Tells of Stealing the
Landlord's Money to
Pay Rent.
BERT SHIELDS HIS MOTHER.
Mrs. Wagner Appeared, but Was
Ignored by Both Her
Boys.
Oakland OrncE Bah Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 26. j
Two unhappy families were in the Police
Court this afternoon. Probably two fam
ilies deserving of more commiseration
never engaged the attention of a court.
Mrs. Willmore, the mother of one of the
boy burglars, was on trial for receiving
sto:en property. Her little girl Ina was
present, under the care of a lady official of
the Chabot Home; her boy Bert was
brought up from the County Jail to testify
as a witness. Mrs. Wagner, trembling
with grief and completely unnerved, sat
in the court with her two little ones. Her
son Archie purposely ignored her, and her
other boy, Abe, evidently felt the same as
his brother.
With the exception of Mrs. Wagner, not
one of the unhappy crowd showed a trace
of grief, but rather indifference was no
ticeable.
Sergeant Hodgkins was the first witness
and he detailed the confession made to
him by Abe Majors a few days ago. An
attempt was made to show that the confes
sion was made under promise of reward,
but no sued proof was brought out. The
witness toid of rinding a bag of money be
hind a picture in the Willmore house and
said that Mrs. Willmore was present when
he did so. The money was produced in
evidence, and as Hodgkins rrave it a shake
there was a smile discernible on the faces
of the boy prisoners.
After Mason, the candvraan, had testified
to the burglary at hi.- Berkeley store, Abe
Majors w:Â«> put on the stand. "He told his
as clearly and unhesitatingly as
though he were repeating a sehoo lesson.
He to:d the Btory of liia ac lainta cc with
tne Willmore family ami of his residence
in their house, a - already published. Head
itii'.tcc doing the M( son burglary at Berke
. ! i rs. V. illmore ol the
burglary befoi a they did it an^ alter it was
done. Bert Willmore gave the money to
his mother in witness' presence.
"Who owns the house you live in?"
asked Prosecuting Attorney Melvin.
"Mr. Mason."
â¢'The confectioner whose store you
robbed?"
\ â  a, sir."'
'â¢And you y>aid the rent with the money
ypu stole?"
"Yea, Bir" â and everybody smiled, in
ig Mrs. Willmore, at what appeared
like a joke on Landlord Mason.
Abe Majors said further: "Mrs. Willmore
awakened us at half-past 3 on the mornine
of the burglary at Mason's store. Mrs.Will
more was up when we returned and the
money was handed to her, and .Bert told
her that the job had been successful. Ina
did not know of the burglary ana at Mrs.
Willmore's suggestion we went to bed to
hide the fact from the girJ. Mrs. Willmore
advised us not to take the electric-cars,
but to walk, for if we rode we might be re
cognized. Bert and I each took $5 of the
money and Mrs. Wiilmore took the rest."
During his examination Abe Majors
testnieu that the bag he-hind the picture
was the household bank and the}' all used
to help themselves. He said that Mrs.
"\\ illmore suggested that he take an as
sumed name so that his mother would net
know his whereabouts.
Tiie witness further stated that the two
toys always told Mrs. Willmore where
they were going and what they were doing.
This c:os~ed the prosecution and the de
fense put Bert Willmore on the stand.
He denied that his mother knew anything
of what was going on and denied ever hav
ing given her any money. He also denied
having told Sergeant Hodgkins? that there
â uas money buried in the yard at the back
of the Willmore house.
Ina Willmore was not put on the stand
to-day. She is a very girlish-looking lktle
maicC in short dresses, and when Abe
Mai >rs' professions of love for her are re
called, any such idea seems absurd". She
talked freely in Judge Woods' chambers
during ihe trial, and was as pay as any
schoolgirl. Sue denies any knowledge of
what was going on in her home.
The examination of Mrs. Willmore was
continued till to-morrow morning.
ABE PLEADS GUILTY.
Young Majors VTill Probably Be Sent
to VVhittier or lone.
OAKLAND, Cat.., Feb. iÂ«.â Abe Majors
and Bort Willmore were arraigned In tie
Superior Court this morning. It was
originally arranged that the boys would
plead fiuilty, and that they should be sent
to a reform school.
Major Whitney and M. C. Chapman ap
peared for Majors, and W. H. O'Brien fur
ilimore. Majors pleaded guilty, but
"Willniore's attorney said that before a plea
was entered be demanded a private exam
ination of the boy in accordance with a
section of the statute covering such cases
between the ages of 10 and 16. On this
plea the case was continued till to-morrow
morning.
Majors' case was taken under advise
ment by Judge Ogden till Friday, when
be will hear evidence in favor of mitiga
tion of punishment. This is the legal
method of laying the foundation for a
commitment to a reform achool instead of
to a penitentiary. *
OFF FOR ALASKA.
A Motnrmaii, Like the Centurion of
Old, Takes a Hundred
Men North.
< i.iKUM' Okfick San Fp.anciÂ«co Call,)
<M* Uroadwav. Feb. 26. \
A ] arty of nearly 100 men are quietly
fitting out here this week . preparatory to
leaving next week for the gold fields of
Alaska. T:.ey have beÂ«?n gathered together
by J. H. Johnson from all sections of the
State Â»nd are mostly "tenderfeet," but
there are a few old-time miners in the
{.any. Johnson was formerly a motorman
on the Oakland Consolidated .Electric
Street Railroad, but tiring of bis work, de
cided to.gb after gold, and in the hopes of
having company and helping to reduce
the necessary expenses, advertised for men
who desired to go to this mecca of miners.
A visit to his rooms to-day showed that
he was going well prepared for the cold
and disagreeable weather that they were
likely to meet. Carpenters' and miners'
t.iols were scattered about with clothing
and footwear for a climate different from
what Oakland is enjoying. It is expected
hat the party will subdivide into messes
of five each, who will purchase jointly a
tent, canvas floor, sneetiron stove, two
saws ami cooking utensils. Then each
must have two pairs of hip gum boots, z.
pair of Canadian snowshoes, gum coat,
two pairs heavy double blankets, two
heavy all-wool sweaters or shirts, two
suits heavy underwear and socks, heavy
overcoat, a blanket coat, heavy hatchet
and some 8 and 10 penny nails.
When it comes to food there is some
latitude, but the official list calls for about
forty articles. These supplies will weigh
about tJOO pounds and cost about $95, ex
clusive of rifle and overcoat. They must
be of the best quality and packed hi pack
ages of about sixty pounds ear.h, not more
than 22 inches long. It is expected that
these will supply a man for six months.
The fare for the trip, including meals and
berth, is $50.
Among the party signed for the trip are
atom a dozen Oaklandors, while the others
come â¢from various cities, ranging from
Marysvilie on the north to Los Angeles on
the south. Dr. Spencer Harris, for two
years assistant to H. C. Dukes, M.D., of
North Temescal, accompanies the party as
druggist, physician and surgeon. He takes
a condensed drugstore and a full surgical
case, and will be ready to attend the wants
of any of the party or outsiders who may
need his services. He pays his way, how
ever, the same as the others, and expects
to be absent two years. The others may
return in the fall.
The destination of the party is about 200
miles over the mountains up the Yukon
River, and every bit ot the camp outfit will
have to be dragged that distance over the
snow by hand. Mr. Johnson placed an
order for I'ukon sleds some time ago at
Juneau, and they will be ready when the
party reaches that point. The exact loca
tion of the carup will be determined after
the riela is reached, but the point aimed at
is about thirty miles from Circle City, on
the Arctic circle and the 122 d meridian of
longitude. As there is about 400 miles
of open country in this immediate vicinity
the party will" naturally scatter consider
able.
The original intention had been to char
ter a vessel and go direct from San Fran
cisco, but this plan has been abandoned,
and they will go to Fort Townsend on the
regular steamer, and from there they
have secured the steamer Ai-Ki. In speak
ing of the enterprise Mr. Johnson said:
"It is the best supplied party that has ever
gone to Alaska from this port. We have
everything arranged, and anticipate a good
trip. One who goes, however, must count
on some hardships, for it is going to be no
picnic party. Two hundred miles' tramp
over mountains, hauling 700 pounds of
freight on a sled, will be no fun. I believe,
however, that every one will make their
expenses, and we may strike it rich."
THREATEN AN INJUNCTION
But It Is Not Certain That One
Restraining the Alameda
Board Will Be Granted.
An Advocate of Woman's Suffrage
Claimed Too Much in Behalf
of the Gentler Sex.
ALAMEPA, Cal, Feb. 26.â Bruner &
Bruner, attorneys, have drawn np a com- .
plaint wherein John T. Fleming is the j
plaintiff and T. W. Lej decker, William '
Hammond, A. Clark, F. J. Fletter and J.
F. forderer, as Trustees of the city of Ala- '
rneda, are defendants, praj'ing for an in- j
junction to restrain them from carrying
out contracts having for their tbject the
enlargement and expansion of th^e munici
pal electric plant. The grounds are that i
they are transcending their authority. The j
complaint has not yet been tiled, but
copies of it have been prepared and Attor
ney Bruner says it will be hied to-morrow.
It is not considered that there is anything j
in the proceeding that will worry the
municipal board, and some declare the !
proceeding will never have a legal standing
in the courts.
lie Claimed Too Much.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 26.â The Rev.
Mr. Lane addressed the ladies of the Po
litical Equality Club on Monday night
last, and was too strenuous in his demand
for the recognition of the gentler sex at
the polls, besides claiming things for the
advocates of political equality that them
selves do not claim. For instance he de
clared that "woman is superior to man,"
that a good government could be carried
on by woman alone, but not by men
alone, and ended up with the rather in
congruous statement that alter political
equality is achieved the women will, like
the women of Colorado, after the first jubi
lee passes off, Â«ettle down to home, sweet
home, again. Tne ladies feel that they
have not been spoken for exactly as they
desire to be. They say they are in earnest,
are not working for a fad, and want to be
treated just as men would be treated who
are striving for rights to which they were
morally entitled. They have written a
communication to that effect to a local
paper.
Churchmen Banquet.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 26.â Forty one or

words of greeting. E. P. Vining, manager
of the street-raiiway system of San Fran
cisco, spoke on "Business and religion."
C. F. Baker took for his subject "Tne Man

It is something extraordinary that liftv

been. The concerts have continued for
about five years. During ail that time no
wealthy person has been asked to take any
tickets. The concerts have simply stood
on their merits. Unquestionably they
have done much to raise a higher stan

ELECTKIC-CAKS CRASH.
As Usual, Unlucky Thirteen Was Very
Much in Evidence.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 26.â There was a
collision on the Alaraeda and Oakland
electric line this morning at 10 o'clock, be
tween cars 12 and 13, at the corner of Sixth
I and Jefferson streets. The former was in
charge of Conductor J. H. Diehl and Mo
torman George Ames, and the latter was
in charge of Conductor Charles Hancock
and Motorman Arthur Wharton. The
regular meeting place of the cars is on
Sixth street, but instead of waiting for the
downcar Motorman Ames attempted to
j round the curve and make the double
track on Jefferson street.
There were very few passengers on either
car, and the only one injured was Mrs. J.
Edwards of 520 Third street, who received
a slight cut over her eye from flying glass.
Car 12 was badly damaged, most of the
glass being demolished. Her rear trucks
were throwH from under the car also. Car
13 escaped with one or two smashed win
dows and a bent trolley pole. A ganu of
men was soon on hand* and the track
cleared, so that traffic was not delayed
long.
Mrs. Edwards, in speaking of the acci
dent, said : "I was coming from Alameda
and was silting on the front end. When
we reached the corner I saw tne other car
coming and that our motorman wÂ«s very
much excited. Before I was able to move
the collision came and I was knocked in
sensible. I do not think there was any
one else injured."
DEEDGIXG HAS CEASED.
The Money in Hand Will Not Justify
Another Contract.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 26.â There is
somewhere between $20,000 to $30,000 left
of the last appropriation made by Con
gress for the work of dredging the Oakland
harbor channel. The work has ceased,
however, because the contract has been
finished, but while the above amount is
available for the making of another con
tract, if it is deemed advisable, it is not
likely it will be.
The price at which the Government can
get dredging done depends somewhat on
the extent of the contrast, and the United
States engineers are HRely to prefer to
carry over the surplus until the beginning
of the next fiscal year and use it in con
nection with whatever this Congress may
appropriate for the work.
Populist State Convention.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 26.â Chairman
E. M. Wardeli of the State Central Com
mittee of the People's party is up from
Los Angeles. To-day in conjunction with

call for the State Convention to be held in
Sacramento May 12. The convention will
consist of two delegates from each count}'
with one additional for each 3oo votes cast
for Mr. Webster, their candidate for Gov- j
ernor last fall. The convention will nomi
nate candidates for Lieutenant-Governor,
nine Presidential electors, seven Congress
men, and will make a recommendation for
United States Senator. It will also elect
delegates to the National Convention of
the party.
The Widow's Admirer Sentenced.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 26.â J. M. Madi

who swindled Mrs. Mary Gray of North
Oakland out of $1000, was allowed to plead
guiity to-day to petty larceny in the Su
perior Court, and in turn received a
sentence of six months in the County Jail.
By good behavior this is reduced to five

REGENT MARTIN TALKS.
He Says the Wilmerding School
Will Surely Be in
Oakland.
The Site at Temescal Is the Unani
mous Choice of the Com
mittee.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broad way, Feb. 26. j
Regent J. West Martin feels confident
Oakland will secure the Wilmerding
School. The reDort of the special com
mittee favoring Ayala Park at Temescal,
between two lines of electric roads, is es
pecially pleasing to him. Referring to the
subject to-day he said :
"There is no doubt that the Wilmerding
School will be located on this side. The
committee on sites reported unanimously
in favor of the Ayala Park proposition.
When the first ballot was cast by the com
mittee there were two votes f r the Sev
enth and Adeline streets site, but the next
ballot showed a unanimous vote for the
Ayala site. The fust time I saw the Ayala
Park I thought I thought it was the ideal
spot for the school. It is a beautiful place.
It is on two electric lines and is convenient
to all the little suburban towns and almost
in the corporate limits of Oakland. It is
only a question of time before that section
will be a part of tha city.
"It is near Berkeley, too; that is a great
thing â having the school accessible to the
university. That was the great objection
to the other sites offered â they were all too
far away. The school will "be. under the
direct supervision of the faculty and Re
gents of the State University and it would
I be absurd to place it in a location incon
j vrnient for them to reach. Every requisi
tion and salary will have to pass through
; the hands of the university contiollers.
| Now, the Ayala Park site is so near that it
will take but a short time for the faculty
or Regents to visit the school. This site
offers several natural attractions. There
is a spring of clear, pure water that will
always give all the water supply needed.
It is laid out as a park, with magnificent j
trees. The location is within half a mile
of two power houses. If power is ever
needed, you see, it will be convenient to
obtain it.
"It is in fact, as I said before, the ideal
spot for the school. I did not try to in
fluence the committee, however, I
showed them all the sites offered and they
saw for themselves that the Ayala prop
erty was the best. It presents more advan
tages than any other property that has
been offered. I consider the question of a
site settled now, for the Regents will not,
unless for very good reasons, act contrary
to the report of their committee. Of course
other fites may be offered, but none to
excel this, I feel sure. I have often told
the Regents that it is not the commercial
value oi the property that we should con
sider as much as the convenience of the
location.
"The San Francisco site is too far out in
the sandhills. We could not consider that
any more than we could consider the of
fers from San Diege and Lake counties.
The Ayala property i 3 valued at $15,000
and I am sure that nowhere could such a
piece of property be obtained at the price

AN APPEAL TAKEN.
The Suit Against the Present Board of
Workar-Is in the Supreme
Court.
Oakland Office San FRArtcisco C\ll )
908 Broadway, Feb. 2*3. )
Attorney George de Golia has carried his
fight against the present Board of Works
to the Supreme Court, and there is a feel
ing of insecurity in several branches of the
city government in consequence.
The point on which the case against the
present board is made is that the special
election at which the amendments to| the
charter were voted upon was invalid, and
that the changes they brought about were
illegal. Several other arguments are ad
vanced as to why the board should be de
clared unconstitutional, the chief , one
being that the members are constantly
passing upon their own acts. As the
board has the appointing of all heads of
departments and of the police and fire em
ployes, interest in the outcome of the suit
is very great. When taken to the Superior
Court the case went against the old board,
but an aDpeal was decided upon, and it is
said that new authorities have been placed
before the Supreme Court that are ex
pucte.d to bring about a reversal of the
judgment.

DR. LE CONTE HONORED
Given a Handsome Easy- Chair
on His Birthday by Berke
ley Collegians.
CATHODE KAY EXPERIMENTS.
Work on the Campus by the Students
Will Begin To-Dayâ Will the
Co-Eds Co-operate ?
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 26.â A grand
ovation was paid to Dr. Joseph Le Conte
at the State University to-day as he en
tered the classroom to begin his Wednes
day lectures to the ?ection in geolocy. The
occasion of this demonstration on the
part of the students was owing to the fact
that to-day was the seventy-third birthday
of the distinguished geologist. The lecture
room was crowded to its utmost by col
legians and other friends of the scientist,
who had gathered to pay him their tribute
of respect in commemoration of the day
of his birth. Besides being given a happy
reception, ho was remembered in a ma
ierial way, having been presented with a
handsomely wrought, solid oak, leather
covered easy-chair.
In response to the presentation speech,
which was made by Marion S. Blanchard,
'97, Dr. Le Conte smike for twenty-five
m mutes, after which the class was dis
missed for the day. The lecture-table, ex
tending the entire distance across the
room, was literally covered with roses,
acacias and violets, and directly in front of
the table Eat a delegation of teachers from
the Le Conte School, which was named
after the proiessor, and who had come to
pay their respects to Dr. Le Conte, whose
portrait was presented to the school by
Mrs. Le Conte on St. Valentine's day.
When the hour for the recitation arrived
Dr. Le Conte came into the lecture-room
in his usual meditative way and was
greeted by a Jong-continued round of ap
plause. To this mark of respect he bowed
lowly and was about to begin his lecture,
when the speaker in behalf of the class
began his presentation remarks. In re
sponse to the few well-chosen words of the
speaker Dr. Le Conte said: "I hardly
know how to thank you for this and all
other of your kindnesses. I cannot speak
to you in formal terms, but within I feel
deeply that you are ladies and gentlemen.
This does not express the relation be
tween us, and so I would, therefore, call
you my pupils, my friends, but, better
than all, my boys and girls. You think
that I have done you some service ana
take this means of expressing your appre
ciation ot it. I shall not," said he, turn
ing to the heavy armchair, "grow older in
resting in so comfortable a resting place."
He continued :
Perhaps you are not aware, on the other
hand, of what good you have done me. All
that is productive of good In the matter is that
which gives and takes. Action and reaction
are equivalent in their results. Good may be
done to the doer. This is a truth throughout
the physical world. I ought to give you a
present, arid I certainly should do so if you all
had a common birthday. If I should attempt
it under the present conditions I tc uld be giv
ing a present to some one of you every day in
the year.
Di. Le Conte then gave a abort sketch of
his early life, and the impulses that
prompted him and the influences that led
him in the period of his growing to man
hood. He said :
In my early life my highest ideal was cult
ure for culture's snkeâ culture intellectual,
moral, physical for the whole man and knowl
edge for knowledge's sake; wisdom for wis
dom's sake. I have since learned that this is
not the highest idealâ time of looking after
one's self. It was eaid of Soiomon that he
ashed and prayed, not for riches, glory and
power; not for wisdom for wisdom's sake, but
wisdom to judge the people. In answer it was
given him wisdom, and riches, glory and
honor in addition.
seek first the highest, and all the lower
blessings will be added unto you. The highest
is not culture for culture's sake, but to im
press that culture upon others' knowledge, so
that you may impart knowledge to others â
wisdom to guide in the conducting of wisdom
to others.
Referring to his life as a physician he
said that in it he did not find satisfaction
to his soul. What was needed he did not
know, but he finally drifted into teaching,
and not until he did begin the instruction
of the young did he find full satisfaction.
It Is said of man that as soon as he marries
his troubles begin, but I say that there his life
begins. He lives no longer for self. He must
necessarily have his interests divi.Jed, and in
thts division is where comfort and blessedness
is found. Just so with teachingâ one cannot
longer live for self aloue. To take up the
work of teaching I left the practice of medi
citu: and became a pupil of Agassiz. It is
now just forty-four years since I began in
structing, and I must say that during that
time I have lived a substantially happy life.
There is nothing wnich stimulates one to
action so vigorously as the co-operation of an
intelligent class eager to learn.
There is nothing which clarities the mind, so
perfectly as the attempt to make a subject clear
to a party of Intelligent listeners. Nearly every
good thought thatl have ever had in my life
has been in the immediate preparation tor my
classroom. If I have published anything in
this world for good it has been through the in
direct influence of my classes. If I have done
anything to influence a character it has re
acted on me.
Tn concluding, he said that he could not
dissipate whatever pleasant feeling that
had been aroused between his hearers and
himself through lecturing on the topic for
the clay, a noble subject though it was, and
in consequence would dismiss the class
with an affectionate and heartfelt "Thank
you."
Cathode Bay Experiments.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 2f>. â The
cathode mv uhotographic experimenters
at the university succeeded to-day in tak
ing several prints of ordinary objects such
as have been used heretofore, in a much
shorter space of time.
Professor Cory, Instructors Drew, Le
Conte and O. V. Lange, a local photogra
nher. succeeded in getting a print of Mr.
Le Conte's hand, showing all the bones of
the tinkers and a bullet lying on top of the
hand, in a well-defined picture after fif
teen minutes exposure of the ray. The
bones of the lingers were particularly dis
tinct. The fleshy part of the hand was,
however, opaque to the rays. On a two
and a half minute exposure they suc
ceeded in taking a photograph of a purse,
which proved to be as good as the one
made last Saturday after an exposure of
one hour.
Professor Cory has been able to work
the Crookes tube so that it will give out a
much more intense light, and so that the
current will be given higher frequency.
These experiments will be continued from
day to clay with the hope of strengthening
the rays still more and of producing pho
tographic prints of objects in leas time
than heretofore.
Students Ready for Work.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 26.â The "stu

the afternoon instead of half of the num
ber working in two-hour shifts each.
The work itself will be in charge of Su
perintendent McLaren of Golden Gate Park
ana Professor Soule of the department of

Superintendent Jack Hays of the Home
for Adult Blind passed an opinion this
afternoon on Colonel Irish.
"I consider John P. Irish," said Hays,
"the worst man in California, so far as
truth and veracity are concerned. He does
not know truth wi.en he sees it. He hates
me because I found him out in his du
plicity, and I did not hesitate to expose
him as a man unworthy of belief. I say
so now, that John P. Irish is a man un
worthy of belief. He is a man without
honor and without word.
'â That is my opinion of this man John
P. Irish in plain English language. Why
then should I worry about ttie statement
of a man whom I charge to be without
honor? I want the public to know why
John P. Irish hates me. During Cleve
land's last campaign I got up a meeting
for Mr. Irish in Aiameda.
''I think it was the only public meeting
in Aiameda County that he was allowed
to address. After Cleveland's election I
called on Mr. Irish and told him I was a
candidate for Naval Officer. He had
promised to support me and also promised
my Aiameda friends that he would sup
port me.
"Tne Democrats of Aiameda County
know Irish. Why, he could not even be
elected a delegate to a little convention in
his own town. I make no bones of what
I think of John P. Irish and he knows it.
I have lived in this county many years,
lam known, and the linger of scorn has
never been pointed at me. My reputation
stands before the people and they know
what I am."
SCIENTIFIC SWINDLERS.
The Gold Brick Workers Were Supplied
With lust ni'iiciii s and Chemicals.
Oakland Office Sab Francisco Call. ) |
908 Broadway, Feb. 2ti. J â¢
The two men in the City Prison who j
have been so quiet now have something to !
explain. Officer Hodgkins found an outfit
this evening that proved how thoroughly j
scientific were toe methods pursued by tbe i
men he arrested last nijjht when perpe- !
trating the gold-brick swindle. The cap
tured collection of instruments and cnemi*
cals is the most complete ever known to
have been used by criminals.
In one valise was a large tin box, on
which was mud, showing that it had been j
buried in the earth. Inside the t ; n box !
were two large "gold" bricks. Each i
weighed about forty pounds and bore j
some resemblance to the genuine metal. !
When rubbed with the finger some of the \
gold came off, showing that it was an or- I
dinary bronze brick washed over with gilt
paint.
In another trunk were some elegant
suits of clothes and advertisements of
bogus mining properties. Another valise
contained some old, lauddy clothes and
pistols. In case some of their schemes
should end tragically and some shooting
follow the brick swindlers were prepared. I
In a valise was a complete little surgical j
outfit, including cotton wool, probes and j
bandagea, besides lotions and shell things I
as are used. Had they been injured there j
would have been no need to risk detection |
by going to a doctor. In some of the i
i cases of attempted swindling an Indian |
i has cut a prominent figure. A complete !
j Indian disguise was found in a valise, i
' with inks and pastes to uÂ«e in the mark- j
I ing. There was also an Indian piece of ]
\ headgear with some dilapidated feathers j
i in it and a pair of worn mocassins.
The most scientific part of the outfit ;
j consisted of some crucibles and acomplete !
assay outfit. There" were chisels and drills i
and acids and lamps. There were also j
some pure gold fillings and valuable nug
gets and rich quartz with which t<> gull
the unwary. There was also genuine j;o!d \
dr.st in envelopes. This was used when a i
suspicious victim should want to see the j
brick bored. The sharpers would bore the ;
brick and carefully put the dust into an I
envelope for the purpose of taking it to a
chemist for a test. On the way the brass
| d\ist would be changed for the gold dust, '
which, of course, would stand the te3t and j
increase tne confidence of the prospective
purchasers.
Andrew Root, the name given by one of
the prisoners, is also known as Miller,
Woods, Raymond and Nesbit.
James Ward is also Known as Leek, and
he has an Eastern prison record.
The clever manner in which the men
were rnn down is the work of Omcer
Hodgkins, who has been working ten days
ou tbe cases. He arrested the men last
night in Alameda, and then learned that
the last time they were in Oakland they
lived at the Hotel Metropole. From there
he followed their baggage till he located it
to-night in Marcuses storage warehouse,
where it had bÂ«en stored. On opening the
many valises the outfit was discovered.
Ritchie, the Napa man who was robbed
some time ago, has identified one of the
men as one who helped to get +5000 out of
him by means of a bogus gold brick.

Changes.
As was expected the Board of Educa
tion exonerated Principal James O'Connor
of the Horace Mann School on the charges
brought against him by Director Hender
son at its meeting last evening.
The Committee on Rules, was to
report whether or not it was worth -while
for the board to occupy its time with a
formal trial, reported as follows:
Gentlemen: Your Committee on Rules, to
whom wad referred the charges against Prin
cipal O'Connor of the Horace Mann School, re
spectfully report that after a careful hearing
of testimony respecting the case, we find :
Firstâ That the disorder in the yard was such
as demanded prompt attention on the part of
the principal.
Secondâ That the expressions,"Get yez to yer
rooms" and '"for 2 cents I would give you a
good bullyragging," were not used, and that
the scope and effect of the othor expressions
were different from what appeared to be tha
case in connection with the written charges.
Third â The second pajrt of the charges was
withdrawn.
Fourthâ We beg to report that we see no
cause for further action in the matter.
The report was adorned by an affirma
tive vote of all the Directors except Mr.
Henderson.
The following changes were recom
mended by the Committee on Janitors and
ratified by the board:

AN EXHIBIT DENOUNCED.
The "California" Exposition in
New York Unfavorably
Received.
A. D. Montague Warns the State Board
of Trade That Its Name is
Improperly Used.
For several months past circulars have
been floating around the State advertising
a "California State exhibit" in Madison
Square, New YorK. The promoters of the
scheme claimed that trie exhibit was in
dorsed by the California State Board of
Trade, and that this body was to exhibit
its big wheel that attracted so much atten
tion at Atlanta. Also that the railroad '
had promised to give free transportation â 
of all poods sent to the New York exhibit. 'â 
All of these statements have "been denied
by the secretary of the State Board of
Tradfl and by W. H. Mills on behalf of the
railroad company. Secretary J. A. Filcher i
yesterday received an interesting letter I
from A. D. Montague, formerly of Mon- j
terey and lately the correspondent at At
lanta for several Los Angeles newspapers.
Mr. Montague made an investigation of \
the Madison-square Garden scheme and j
upon this subject he writes the following:
California had letter guard her reputation
in time, and you nil would be wiae to keep an j
eye on the Madison-square 'iarden fake. 1 a::i
i stonisbed over it all myself. Here's bow itis:
I went down to Madison-yquare Garden and
found the you tier gentlemen who are running i
the thine and had a long- talk with themâ at ,
least with the manager and secretary. Man- '
ager Wakes Is a:i infant of about 25 years, I !
think, wi:h a downy mustache and a eoinpla
cent conscience. He is sorely afflicted with the
ci*ar habit. I lotuid out that he was an ns-ist
ant at the World's Fair in the general man
ager's office, and that be feels fully capable of
conducting the proposed exposition. Ithoutrht

The secretary, Mr. Page, is & pftle, waxen ' ,

ennuiâ chronic tired feeling. I got out of ;
there very angry at their presumption and
hastened down to the Sun office and had an
interview with the editor. The Sun is a good - '
fn. nd of California and on its supposition that !
the board was back of the affair, it gave a very
line notice of the slick little money-making
Fi'heme, both in the news and editorial
columns. The upshot of it was, 1 wrote the i
following:
Mr. Montague's article for the New York
Sun was a scathing denunciation of the
Madison-square Garden scheme, so far as
its alleged connection with any California
organization or body of responsible men
is concerned. In conclusion and alluding
to the proraotors' endeavor to secure the
indorsement^ of the Southern Pacific, Mr.
Montague writes:
The general Eastern agent of the Southern
Pacific Company says Mr. Huntington <le
ciin.,l to comply with their request and that
the Southern Pacific Company regards the
fcheme as a wildcat proposition and very un
trustworthy.

IRISH REPLIES
TO GOV. BUDD.
Another Short but Very-
Sharp Bit of Personal
Literature
ON THOSE EXPULSIONS.
Executive Referred to as a Dis
gusting Person Unfit for
His Office.
WHAT GEO. P. MORROW SAYS.
Except in the Personalities Employed
He Concurs With Col. Irish
Throughout.
Now comes John P.lrish and has this
to say to or about Governor Budd and all
others who have entered in any wise into
the controversy provoked by the removal
of Colonel Irish from the directorship of
the Industrial Home for the Adult Blind:
"I have read all that the Governor has
to say, and observe tnat neither he nor
any other denies a single statement I have
made of the incidents leading up to the
displacement of Sanders and the reasons
therefor. That is my case, and it stands
unchallenged.
"The Governor in his hoodlumesque
phrase says I am 'squealing' because he
'kicked' me out of an 'office.' That is the
high conception the fellow has of a labori
ous and humane trust which carries no
financial compensation. My appointment
to it by Governor Bartlett 1 have always
considered an honor. My removal by
Budd is an honor.
"The reasons therefor are so variously
stated that they amuse me. The latest as
signed by the Governor is that some mem
bers of a reprobate committee of the Leg
islature wanted an expelled inmate named
Taylor reinstated. These persons charge
that Taylor was removed for testifying be
fore this committee. This is absolutely
false. Taylor hail been long under tolera
tion, and his violations of discipline finally
compelled his expulsion.
"These eonimitteemen in their letter to
the Governor say :
He recently made application for reinstate
ment, which was indorsed find recommenced
by Superintendent Hays, but his application
â was rejected by the board aad no reason given
therefor.
"That is true. Bat the 'board' which
rejected Taylor consisted of three of
Buda's appointee?., and Mr. Leach, while I
was 3500 miles away in tie East! The
board was three to one, as between the
new ana old policy. Mr. Leach's lone
vote would not reject Taylor, therefore
this was done by the Governor's board.
â¢I wish to say that no inmate was ever
expelled except for violations of discipline
and after long and patient trial and ad
monition, and if Taylor is readmitted it
will be most unjust not to readmit all, for
he wa;s a chief offender.
"But why need I pay further attention
to it, or to the disgusting person who is
more hopelessly out of reach of the mental
and moral circumference of the office of
Governor than any who ever neld it?"
George P. Morrow, vice-president of the
Produce Exchange, who was one of the
board of directors with Colonel Irish, had
this to say about the matter yesterday: "I
concur in everything Colonel Irish has
eaid regarding the home, excepting the
personal attack upon the Governor. I
ddn't believe in that any more than I did
in the attack upon the President tne other
day. I think the office is bigger than the
man and shouid exempt them from per
sonal attack. At the same time I have
to say that this is the first time that poli
tics lias been done in connection with the
Home for the Blind for some time, and
low-down politics, too. Jack Hays, the
new Superintendent, in whose behalf this
upheaval is made, is a personal friend of
mine. I think he is a tine fellow, but I
don't think he is the man for that place
and I told him so. I told him he ought
not to accept it. I believe he will make a
failure of it.
"I don't moan to say that I think
Hays would fail at everything he mignt
unuÂ» rtake, for I don't think so. But that
place requires a specialist, and Zanders,
the blinu superintendent who was turned
ont to give Hays the job, was such a spe
cialist, and a good one. I have been con
nected with a good many business in
stitution?, and I know something of what
they require. Sanders' loss of sight
seemed to quicken his every other faculty.
He was a keen business man, and made
a perfect success of that institution. I was
appointed by Markham at a time when
politics were sizzling. The State conven
tion was in session. I understood that* 1
was expected to turn things upside down
over there. At that time I was prejudiced
against John P. Irish. I did not like him.
Before I did any upsetting of things, how
ever, 1 was determined to have good
reason. I made a careful study of the in
ptltuiion, and, as a result, 1 didn't turn
anything over. I left it just as it was. I
became convinced that Sanders was the
right man in the right place, and I believe
so yet.
"I think this removal of Irish a great
mistake. You see my prejudice against
Irish has melted also. 1 have a good deal
more confidence in him than I have in
Budd.
"There is N\ W. Spaulding, also one of
the most honest, careful and conscien
tious of our citzens. He was on the board
with usâ was removed by Governor Bndd
at the same time l.was. When appointed he
began a careful and independent study of
the institution and its workings; used to
t:ikc his wife and spend days there during
the lirst month or two after his appoint
im-nt. Tlie result was that he, too, fell
into line with the administration as it was
and supported what I think he had first
been disposed to oppose.
"Now, as for the legislative report so

much stress is laid upon. It dwelt
particularly upon the filth .alleged to
have been discovered in the smoking
room. Nearly all thope blind men smoke
and chew tobacco. They cannot see a
spittoon â a man wiih eyes seldom hits a
spittoon when he tries. The result is that
this room, where many of the inmates
spend most of their time in smoking, is,
except for the first live minutes after it is
waslied outâ not as pleasant a place as
some others. But the institution proper
was kept perfectly clean, the food was ex
cellent, nicely cooked and nicely served.
Complaints there was and always will be,
for when a man loses his sight, he becomes
a crank. I have stood with other directors
in the dining-room and seen a dinner
served to them that any man might en
joy and heard them complain bitterly â
they not Knowing tnat we were there. The
inmates who were put out were constant
fomenters of trouble and had been for a
long time before.
"Again, I say, I concur in all that Col
onel Irish has said."
LOSES HIS SUIT.
John Nash Fails to Get Judgment
Against Mm. Ernestine Kreling
of the Tivoli.
A decision was given in Mrs. Kreling's
favor yesterday in John Nash's suit
In instructing the jury Judge Hunt
said he considered that the letters and
telegrams received by John Nash from
Mrs. Kreling constituted a contract for
one year, but that lie could see no cause
why the $1120 salary claimed for the sec
ond year should be paid.
At the time of Mr. Nash's dismissal
from the Tivoli the first year of his en
gagement had expired, with the exception
of five weeks.
The Judge stated that it was for the jury
to consider whether the $420 salary for
three weeks should be paid to Mr. Nash or
whether the negligence of his duties, to
which witnesses had testified, did not de
bar him from receiving this salary.
The jury, which was only out of court
five minutes, gave a verdict for Mrs.
Kreling. It was decided that the plaintiff
by absenting himself from his duties dur
ing the afternoon had forfeited any claim
to the salary for the live weeKs.
THE RAILWAY WEAKENS.
Southern Pacific Fares to Port
land Had to Be Re
duced.
Passengers Patronizing the Oregon
Steamers and the Low Rates
Almost Exclusively.
The Southern Pacific Company has
weakened in its fight with the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company for
passenger business between San Francisco
and Portland. The railroad company
about two months ago declared it was
master of the situation, and, acting upon
this bold stand, advanced its rates from
the low standard made in opposition to
the steamers. It now turns out that the
advance on presumption of superiority of
service was only an experiment tried in
the nature of a "bluff." For the railway
company admitted its defeat yesterday
when it reduced rates to Portland from
$7 50 to $5 for second class and from $15 to
$10 for fir&t class.
The rate was the same when the tight
was on late last year between the two com

THE WHITE STAR STEAMSHIP DORIC, WHICH ARRIVED FROM LIVERPOOL LAST NIGHT.
[From a photograph.]
by the all-rail route and travel in comfort
and safety,'' Vice-President Stubbs said.
"We have found that people continue to
patronize an all-rail route although the
fares, are higher than the steamer line, and
we feel sure that they will continue to
patronize our road at the advanced, fig
ures."
That was when the rates were raised a
peg from $5 and $10.
A week later the passenger officials de
clared that trains for Portland were full as
ever, and the traveling public was patron
izing them even more generously than
when the low rates prevailed. This was
almost sufficient reason for hopes that still
another advance might be made in the
near future. Bat the development of time,
it now appears, had quite another effect.
Instead of an advance the railway com
pany found it had to reduce the fares be
tween Portland and San Francisco. Oth
erwise the Oregon Company's steamers
would carry nearly all the passengers be
tween the two cities at the nominal rates
of $2 50 and $"j adopted by its manager
when the war was on.
The reduced railway rates will go into
effect to-morrow.
A CAUSE CELEBRE.
Surcfsnf ii I Rehearsal of the Mock Trial
for the Mercantile Library.
The trial to be held to-morrow for the
benefit of the Mercantile Library had a
full rehearsal last night at Dr. Gibbons'
house, 920 Polk street. All the performers
were present and the trial went off splen
didly. "Uncle" George Bromley sus
tained his role of defendant with a touch
ing mixture of pathos at finding himself
accused of stealing a lone widow's coat,
and reckless hardihood to the gibes of the
District Attorney. Among the jurors last
night were: Louis Sloss, Jeremiah Lynch,
Porter Ashe and C O. D. Miiler.
It is expected that the Judge and at
torneys will be "gowned" in the wigs and
robesof English Judges and barristers in
order to give the court all the pomp and
A Worthless Check.
John W. Barnes, an East-street saloon
keeper, swore out a warrant yesterday for the
arrest of John P. Peralta, 728 Albion street,
Oakland, on the charge of obtaining money by
false pretenses. About two weeks ago he made
some puFchases in Barnes' saloon and gave
him a check for $50 on the Nevada Bank, bear
ing the signature "Schutz and Company, C.
D. C." Barnes cashed the check, and when
presented at the bank it was declared to ue
worthless.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1896.
ARRIVAL OF THE DORIC
The Splendid White Star Steam
ship Is Direct From
Liverpool.
WAS FORTY DAYS EN ROUTE.
Her Commander Is an Officer in the
Royal Naval Reserveâ For the
China Run.
The splendid White Star steamship
Doric arrived last night direct from Liver
pool and anchored off Powell street. She
is forty-one days between port and port,
but having to anchor over night at Sandy
Point, the entrance to the Straits of Ma
gellan, consequently her steaming time is
forty days. The distance is 13,600 miles,
which makes an average of over fourteen
knots an hour. Notwithstanding the fact
that she started with new boilers and
engines there were only two stops at sea
one of an hour and the other of five
minutes. During all the long voyage the
propeller recorded just 4,000,000 revolu
tions. She was built about twelve years
ago, but has been refitted throughout for
the Occidental and Oriental service.
In appearance she resembles her sisters,
the Oceanic, Coptic and Belgic, but her in
terior is more magnificent than that of the
three other vessels. The furnishings are
of oak, teaK and mahogany, the colors of
the wood blending together in perfect har
mony. The saloons with their beautiful
gildings, the cozy smoking-rooms with
their easy chairs and lounging-places, the
library with its hundreds of finely bound
volume?, and, above all, the grand, large
statero .ii.s, mako this noble craft a veri
table ocean palace.
She is 440 feet long (ten feet more than
the Ccpcic), 44-foot beam and 31 feet in
depth. Her gross tonnage is 4784, more
than that of her sister by 336 tons. The
engines are triple expansion, of 3"i00 horse
power, fitted with Howdon's forced
draught. Her new boilers have been tested
at 180 pounds steam pressure.
The Doric is commanded by Captain
Harry Smith, a brother of the old captain
of the Oceanic. He holds the commission
of lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve.
First Officer A. Hambleton is also an
officer in the reserve.
The other ofiicers are: C. E. Starck, sec
ond ; B. P. Lawlor, third ; C. H. Cross,
fourth; W. Allen, chief engineer; J. Gas
ton, first assistant; J. Reid, second; David
McKinnon, third; Thomas Tomlinson,
fourth; William Crawford, fifth; Thomas
Hellon, boiler-maker. Chief Steward W.
"Wheat is acting purser. Chief Engineer
Allen. First Assistant Geston and Third
Assistant .McKinnon are old O. and O.
engineers and well known here.
"I bade my old ship, the Oceanic, good
by when we steamed out of Belfast^" said
the chief last night. "She has been sold
to Hanand & "Wolfe of that place, and I
imagine she will be refitted for the German
Ocean trade.
"The company wanted a larger and faster
vessel for this run and here we are.
Nothing of any note happened during our
trip, we just went ahead day after day
reeling off fourteen and fifteen knots from
hour to hour. In calm and storm the
Doric goes grandly on like the stately Gre
cian motion that has given her a "name.
These great new engines drive her in the
teeth of a gale as they do over the smooth
waters ol the harbor."
The Doric will discharge her small
freight of about a thousand tons or so and
prepare for her first trip to China and
Japan. When she was first reported last
night she was taken for the Belgic, which
is due from the Orient.
OLYMPIC CLUB DIRECTORS
They Will Ask Leventritt to
Build on His Prop
erty.
A New Handball Court Contemplated.
Boxing, Wrestling and Billiard
Contests.
The Olympic Club directors appointed a
committee consisting of Dr. Short and
President Eaton last evening to visit
Leventritt, the owner of the property
which adjoins the club building on its
west side, and make terms with him, if
possible, regarding the erection of a hand
ball court, according to the plans that
have been submitted and approved of b" v
the board.
The proposition that will be submitted
to Mr. Leventritt is that he will nave a
building constructed on the lot in accord
ance with the plans, and that the cluo will
lease the property for a term of years at a
fair rental.
The directors sanctioned the holding of
a championship wrestling tournament in
the gymnasium some time in the latter
part of March. It will be open to all ama
teur athletes, who will be classified accord
ing to their weights.
A feature t:at will create much interest
among the members will be a boxing
tournament open to amateurs in good
standing. The contests will be held at the
Pavilion during the last week of April,
and the books of the club are now open to
the boxers who wish to participate. The
preliminary bouts will be held in the
gymnasium of the club and the rinals in
the Pavilion. The weights will be heavy,
middle, welter, light, feather and bantam.
As this will be the annual champion
ship meeting of athletes wi:o are clever
with their "props," it is expected that a
large number of entries will be received
from the clubs of San Francisco, Oak
land, Sacramento, Stockton and Los An
geles. Particulars can be had from either

Director Short or Superintendent Ken
nedy of the club.
A contract for the improvement of the
outdoor grounds will be awarded to-day,
and Peter Mclntyre, who is care-taker of
the grounds, is consequently happy in the
thought that the once pretty athletic park
will once again resume its former appear
ance.
The championship games will be held
therein April, and some great perform
ances in track and field events will cer
tainly result, as the Stanford and Berkeley
universities will send their best men to
the field to compete against the represen
tatives of the athletic clubs of this City
and Oaklund.
The billiard tournament is nearing the
end. In the first class C. H. Williams, O.
B. Burns and E. L. Lewis will take the
prizes offered by the club. In the second
class L. Nolan and A. C. Thornton will
taice first and second respectively, and for
third prize the contest lies between Hodg
kins and Smith, who have scored a tie.
The third-class players are having a very
spirited race. The winners will in all
probability be A. C. Hampton, P. C. vVeg
eiior, J. Bennett and J. McCarthy. The
latter has not finished his score, and
should he defeat the players whom he will
meet in the finals he will stand a very ex
cellent chance of taking the first prize. It
is expected that the tournament will con
clude on Saturday evening.
BACK FROM SPAIN.
Charles Fair Has Returned After Throe
Months' Absence There and in Italy.
Charles L. Fair, who has for some three
months past been in Europe, returned
last night, and is at the Palace. He said
he had spent most of the winter in Spain,
where there was no snow, except on the
mountains. He was in Italy only a brief
time.
Mr. Fair says Europe looks much like it
did to him four years ago, when he was
last there. . No particular change was no
ticeable in any way, and business appeared
to be about as lively as usual. 'Mrs. Fair
was with ; him on the trip. The sojourn
abroad was very pleasant. â¢

AFTER SIXTEEN YEARS.
The Association of Marine Un
derwriters Hold a
Meeting.
In the Evening the Insurance Men
Regaled Themselves at a Sump*
tuous Banquet.
The Association of Marine Underwriters
of San Francisco yesterday celebrated its
sixteenth annual birthday.
The members of the organization met in
the afternoon in the boardroom of the
Marine Underwriters at 303 California
street, R. B. Hooper presiding and Harri
son Housewortb officiating as secretary.
Charles Page presented a paper in rela
tion to the Hnrter act recently passed by
Congress, explaining its origin and effect.
He told how it has heretofore been the
Drivilege of vessels to deviate from their
course for the purpose of saving life with
out invalidating their insurance policies,
but that now, under the maritime lnw
passed at the instance of Congressman
Harter, vessels may deviate from their
course for the purpose of saving property
without either invalidating policies or sub
jecting owners or charterers to claims for
damages likely to occur to perishable or
other cargo.
Mr. Page suggested that a change might
be made hereafter in insurance policies, to
minimize the additional risk entailed by
virtue of the new act.
Other papers were read by William
Henry 0. Fowler, on the subject, "Our
Association" and by H. S. Smith on "Un
â eeen Hazards."
Last evening a majority of the members
of the association regaled themselves at a
banquet at the Maison Riche. It was a
royal affair in the large dininc-room. The
guests were each furnished with a magnifi
cently engraved menu giving views of
Pigeon Point, Lighthouse, Golden Gate,
Cataiina Island, Fort Ross chute landing,
draw bridge, a Chinese junk and Angel

The menu itself was as follows:
