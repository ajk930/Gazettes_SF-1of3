ILLINOIS DEMOCRATS GATHER
State Issues Overlooked in
the Great Presidential
Struggle.
SENATOR TELLER FINDS
FAVOR.
But Leaders May Head Off the
Boom With a Platform
Favoring Silver.
BOIES MEN ARE VERY ACTIVE
AND SANGUINE.
Governor Altgeld Will Control The
Convention, However, and Dic
tate All Action.
PEORIA, 111., June 22.â Perhaps the
most significant feature of the gathering
of the Democratic clans for to-morrow's
State Convention is the strong under
current of sentiment in favor of the
indorsement of Senator Teller a3 a Presi
dential candidate upon an out anil out free
coinage platform by the National Con
vention at Chicago. Sizzling and swelter
ing under a thermometer that reached
and passed the century mark, the as
sembled hosts debated this point pro and
con to the exclusion of the merits of candi
dates for the State ticket and other de
tails usually assigned to first con
sideration.
There is no question that were a Teller
resolution introduced to-morrow it would
receive the support of quite a respectable
following, but the suggestion is
antagonized by the Altgeld machine, and
as a consequence it is not likely to be
heard of on the floor. During the day
"Secretary of State Hinrichson, the or
ganizing lieutenant of Governor Altgeld,
was visited at his quarters by a large num
ber of delegates in sympathy with the
Colorado Senator and his following, and
who argued with more or less vigor and
earnestness that a coalition of the Na
tional silver Democrats with the silver
Republicans would certainly result in the
triumph of the white metal in November.
To one and all, however, the secretary
had but one reply. He contended that
any attempt toward the indorsement of
an erstwhile Republican at Chicago would
result in a bolt of the gold-standard dele
gates; that these in turn would hold a
convention of their own and nominate a
ticket which would be heralded as that of
the simon-pure Democracy, and that such
ticsec would receive the support of the
strongest Democratic agricultural and
farming elements, to whom he silver
champions, look mostly for support, and
who will be unwilling to swallow Teller
and his life-long Republicanism, even if
baited with a silver hook.
"Let us nominate a silver Democrat at
Chicago." was Mr. Hinrichsen's conclud
ing argument, again and again repeated,
"and if the silver Republicans want to
come to us, well and good; it not, let them
nominate their own ticket and carry their
own States. We will do the same, and
silver will fare just as well in the Electoral
College." As to the convention to-morrow,
it is sufficient to say that Governor Altgeld
is in absolute control, and that to 900 or
more of the thousand delegates bis wiil
is law.
He it is who will name the four dele
gates at large and forty out of the forty
four district delegates â the majority being
also tied to his post by the operation of the
unit rule. Likewise will he stand sponsor
for every plank of the platform and desig
nate every nominee upon the State ticket,
including his own renomination for the
governorship. Finally he will go to Chi
cago with the vote of the entire delegation
in his pocket, to be cast or not to be cast,
as he may will it. It is the story of the
Colorado Republican Convention retold,
with Altgeld in the place of Teller. It is
to be a one-man convention, and the dele
gates, in the proportion of three to one,
seem satisfied with the situation.
The Iowa promoters of the Boies boom
made little impression during the day, al
though they worked hard. Each arriving
delegate and party woriter was furnished
with a picture of the ex-Governor and a
pamphlet sketch of the public life and
public services over the caption: "Silver
must be restored is the issue of "96."
But the literature lacked potency. Gov
ernor Alt,- eld, when talked to in the in
terest of the Iowa candidate, was decidedly
non-committal. He characterized as an
invention of the "goldbugs" the story
that he was opposed to Mr. Boies because
the latter had made a speech justifying
President Cleveland in sending Federal
troops to Chicago during the labor troubles,
but admitted having said that this speech
might react against Boies among the la
boring element in the event of his being
the nominee. On general principles he
thought the ex-Governor's attitude on the
public questions of the day should entitle
him to consideration at the hands of the
Chicago convention.
Lithographs of Bland of Missouri were
displayed in the National Hotel this even
ing, but if he had any sponsors they
failed to put themselves in evidence.
As for ex-Congressman Morrison, not
long ago regarded as a "favorite son," his
name was not mentioned even in under
tone-. The slate for delegates at large
was agreed upon at a conference of the
Governor and his lieutenants this evening.
[â  is headed by the Governor himself,
with Secretary Hinrichsen, Judge Sam P.
O'Connell of Chicago and General Lewis
15. Parsons of Florida as his associates,
Tie latter is SO years Old.
Thomas H. Gal.an of Chicago has been
â¢dated to succeed National Committeeman
Ben R. Cable. The platform will in tne
main be devoted to State affairs, the Na
tional planks being confined to declara
tions for free-silver coinage and revenue
tariff.
COLD MEN TO CONTROL.
Cleveland's Friends Appear to Have
Captured the Wisconsin
Convention.
MILWAUKEE. Wib., June 22.â The
The San Francisco Call.
gold men and mends of Cleveland appear
to have captured the Wisconsin Democ
racy, and at the convention of the party,
which will assemble at the Bijou Theater
to-morrow at 11 o'clock, the gold men will
be able to run things their own way. The
silver forces of the State are not organized
and the victories won by them in the pre
liminary skirmishes about ten days ago
alarmed the gold men and only tended to
spur them on to more vigorous efforts.
Every sound-money man in the State
was called upon to make a special effort to
secure the election of the gold delegates,
and the result was that in some of the
counties which were thought to be bi
metallic the gold men were successful.
There will be 359 delegates in the conven
tion and a careful estimate shows there
will be, as far as heard from, 149 gold men,
87 silver men and 62 doubtful.
Thomas F. Frawley of Eau Claire, a
sound-money man, will be temporary
chairman.

DEMOCRATS OF TEXAS.
Sound-Money Men Will Be Beaten
by the Champions of the
White Metal.
AUSTIN, Tkx.. June 22.â The Demo
cratic State Convention to elect delegates
to the National Convention meets to-mor
row, and indications are that there will be
a hot fight in the free-silver ranks over
the delegates from the State at large. The
convention will undoubtedly be dominated
by the free-silver element.
The State Convention of the sound
money Democrats also meets here to-mor
row, and will probably send a contesting
delegation to Chicago. The call was for
this purpose, but the development of the
free silver strength in the National Con
vention has thrown a damper on the propo
sition.
WILL IGNORE CLEVELAND.
Silver Men Propose to Rule the
Ohio State Democratic
Convention.
COLUMBUS, Ohio. June 22.â As the ad
vance guard of the delegates to tne Demo
cratic State Convention arrive, it seems
the sentiment for free silver coinage is
even stronger tnan anticipated. It is al
most impossible to find an advocate of the
sinpie-gold standard among the Demo
crat? present to-night. There is not the
slightest doubt that the delegates at large
will be free-silver men, and it is likely that
the convention will declare in favor of the
unit rule and instruct the delegation to
Chicago to cast the entire vote of the State
for free silver.
To-night it was announced that the
State Central Committee, of which a major
ity is for the gold standard, would name a
gold-standard Democrat for temporary
chairman of the convention. This so ex
asperated the free-silver men that they is
sued notice from their headquarters that
if this was done they would ignore the S3
lection and choose a chairman of their
own. They have agreed upon Ihomas E.
Powell oi this city for temporary chair
man. The free-silver organization has de
cided that the convention shall not in
dorse any candidate for the Presidential
nomination.
This will be fatal to the aspirations of
John W. Bookwalter, who was to ask for
the indorsement of the convention. His
friends still say that a motion will be
made to give him this indorsement. The
platform is to be short. It will declare in
the plainest terms for the free coinage of
silver in the ratio of 1(5 to 1, denounce the
work of the present Legislature and the ad
ministration of Governor McKinley; criti
cize the Congress at the last session and
ignores President Cleveland entirely.

SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, JUNE 23, 1596.
ators Voorhees and Turpie, B. F. Shively
of South Bend and J. G. Shanklin of
Evansville. The nominee for Governor
will be ex-Congressman Shively of South
Bend. The permanent chairman will be
K. C- Bell of Fort Wayne. The platform
declares for the "immediate restoration of
silver to the place it held in our monetary
system before the act of 1873, and the free
coinage of both metals at the ratio of 16
to 1." It declores for a purely revenue
tariff and the election of Senators by the
popular vote, and contains a strong reso
lution favoring Cuban independence.
NEW YORK'S DEMOCRACY.
Leaders Have Selected Delegates
and Alternates for the National
Convention.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 22.â Several
of tne prominent Democratic leaders are
in Albany to-night. Chairman Binkley
of the State Committee arrived this even
ing and proceeded at once to Senator Hill's
home, where he will spend the night. Ex-
Secretary of the Navy Whitney accom
panied him. Senator Hill, Mr, Whitney
and Mr. Hinkley will start to-morrow for
Saratoga. A long conference between the
leaders ensued at Senator Hill's home.
Tne discussion was, of course, mainly on
the platform to be adopted and the fignt
to be made for honest money at Chicago.
It is understood the four delegates at
large to the Chicago convention will be
Senators Hill and Murphy, ex-Governor
Flower and Frederick R. Coudert.
Mr. Whitney reiterated nis desire not to
go as a delegate, and Mr. Coudert was de
cided upon. It is well known that Senator
Murphy, although he will be elected a
delegate at large, does not intend to go to
Chicago. As his alternates two names are
mentioned â ex-Postmaster - General Bis
sell of Buffalo and ex-Mayor Grace of New
The Wreck and Ruin Made by the Collapse of the Lodging- House at Fifth Street and Mint Avenue.
Several People Were Killed by the Fall of the Building and Some Were Injured.
Yorfc. If Mr. Coudert is put on as a dele
gate Mr. Bissell, rather than Mr. Grace,
will probably be selected for Senator Mur
phy's alternate.
Hon. John Boyd Thatcher, Mayor of
Albany, wiil be temporary chairman of
the State Convention and it is settled that
the temporary organization shall be made
permanent.
The financial plank of the platform will
follow the lines laid down in previous
State platforms and declare for the gold
standard. Bimetallism will only be recog
nized through an intTiiational agreement.
BELMONT COMING HOME.
Will Shorten His European Tour In
Order to Attend the Democratic
National Convention.
PARIS, France, June 22.â A representa
tive of the United Press to-day questioned
the Hon. Perry Belmont regarding a
statement that he intended to brine his
European tour to a close and return to the
United States. Mr. Belmont confirmed
the report and added that he intended to
sail for New York in a short time in order
to attend the Democratic National Con
vention as a delegate from Suffolk County,
New York.
MARCUS AURELIUS
HANNA AT HOME,
Next to McKinley He Is
the Most Popular Man
in Ohio.
SHREWD BUT JOVIAL.
Cosgrave Tells of the Character
istics of the Great Political
Manager.
DECIDEDLY A BUSINESS MAN.
But Indomitable Good Humor Keeps
His Mind in Equipoise and
Serenity.
CLEVELAND. Ohio, June Marcus
Aurelius Hanna, next to his friend Wil
liam McKinley, is the most popular man
to-day in Ohio. When he came home from
St. Louis last Saturday he was received
in a manner befitting Caesar on his return
from the Gallic wars, and there was almost
as much enthusiasm over ' im in Cleve
land as there was over Major McKinley in
Canton. The American people admire a
clever man, and they are inclined, perhaps
a little too much; to worship success.
Mr. Hanna is both clever and success
ful, and that is why he is admired. Ido
not know of any other person living in
the shadow of the smoke from the factory
chimneys of tlie E;*st or West who can
show the same executive ability or who can
show the same capacity for handling
varied enterprises. He is a thorough bus
iness man, ajid his prominence aa a politi
cal manager is due to the fact that when
he has a campaign to make he looks upon
it just as be would look upon any business
enterprise â simply as a piece of work to be
done and to be done well.
It was part of his business to see that
the large investments which he has made
should be protected from the danger of a
currency which fluctuate in value and
which is recognized as bullion by those
nations with which this country has the
most intercourse. It was also a part of
his business affairs to prevent the flooding
of this country with the cheap labor
products of Europe under the Democratic
system of tariff which has ruined agricul
turists in California and which would in
time bring wages and the standard of liv
ing down to the low level of European
paupers and Asiatic coolies. He knew
that the masses of tne people of the East
and the "West and the middle W r est were a
unit on thi3 proposition, the feeling, if
anything, being stronger in the large man
ufacturing districts than it even is on the
Pacific Coast. He knew that this was a
matter which went beyond mere partisan
politics, because it concerned the bread
and butter of the laborer and the mechanic
ail over the Nation because the laborers
and mechanics have become educated by
bitter experience into the knowledge that
if a man sends his money away from home
be will in course of time be allowed to send
his labor away from home also.
It was apparent to him that the forego
ing state of affairs, if allowed to prevail,
would so diminish the purchasing power
of the masses of the people that the sales
of goods would decrease, prices would
cheapen with the cheapening of their
price of labor and the margin of profit
would become smaller and smaller. Mr.
Hanna, no doubt, Knew from the his
tory ol this country that the high-priced
times were the most prosperous. The
tramp and the industrial army were un
known, factories were running full time,
and with full sets of hands, good prices
prevailed for farm and all other home
products. But by and through the intro
duciion of foreign competition, which the
Democracy welcomed with open arms and
beating heart, the nickel becomes split up
into cent pieces and the Democracy
achieved its heart's desire of cheap goods
made by cheap men, women and children.
It was necessary, in order to restore the
old condition of things, to nominate and
elect a President who would be in touch
with the best interests of the people, both
employers and employed. Such a man
had been in Mark Hanna's eye for many
years, a man devoted to the principles of
protection and whom the people of his
own and surrounding States honored for
it. That man was William McKinley of
Canton, Ohio, only sixty miles away from
Mr. Hanna's home. . Here was the work
to be done to save the industrial interests
of this country, and here was the man who
could do it. Mr. Hanna comprehended
the many serious difficulties in the way.
He was aware that Platt of New York and
that Wall street wanted Levi P. Morton
for the Presidency; that New England was
under the magnetic spell of Tom Reed ;
that Quay of Pennsylvania, with his lever
on that State, was a foeman not to be de
spised, he being one of the subtlest and
most energetic of politicians. Then there
was the silver rock away out West on
which Teller and his adherents had taken
their stand.. A man with less steam-power,
with less will force and courage than Mark
Hanna, would have faltered in the face of
so many obstacles, but these seemed only
to inspire him.
Mr. Hanna pToceeded to do business on

The disaster came without the faintest premonitory warning â a sudden creaking
of timber, a cracking of glass and then a thundering crash, and the tall frame
structure sank in a cloud of dust,. Presently the scene was one of wild excitement
with crowds pressing forward to see what had happened, and a band of heroic volun
teer rescuers working amid the debris. The building was used as a lodging-house
and coffee-saloon, at 20 and 22 Fifth street, immediately opposite the United
States Mint.
The dust from the shattered plaster and walls rose high in the air, and before it
cleared away loud shrieks and calls for help were heard, and these told the crowd that
there were unfortunate people under and within the ruins.
The members of No. 17 engine, on Mint avenue, a few doors west of the fallen
structure, were among the fir.->t to rush to the scene of the disaster to render assist
nnce to those imprisoned within the ruins or pinioned underneath the broken timbers.
Volunteers went to their assistance and the work of searching for those who needed
help was commenced at once.
The first to be removed was a woman, who was on the sidewalk, having been
struck as she was passing by. She was conveyed into the undertaking establishment
of McAvoy & Gallagher, in the building adjoining on the east, and when examined it
was discovered that she was dead.
Then came the sound of the alarm bells and whistles, summoning the firemen to
signal station No. 47, and when Chief Engineer Sullivan ascertained the occasion for
the alarm he directed his men in the work of rescue. This was done as quickly as it
possibly could be. Men with axes cut away the roof timbers which were hurled to
firenieu and volunteers who passed them from one io another until out of the way.
Directed by the heartrending cries of the imprisoned people the men plied the
axes and tore away protruding scantling and boards, and every now and then some
one was taken out and conveyed to the patrol wagons in waiting to convey them to
the Receiving Hospital.
Thus the work continued until ten had been removed and taken to where willing
hand-: were waiting to give them the attention they required.
While this was going on there was another horror. It was discovered that the
ruins in the upper rear corner had caught fire from the kitchen range, which had been
precipitated into the excavation. The already appalled onlookers seemed for a time
paralyzed at the sight when they realized that there might still be some people in the
building, and if not dead they would be smothered to death.
A hundred suggestions were offered as to what the fireman ought to do. Calmly
and coolly the officers directed some of their men to attack the burning mass with
streams from the chemical engines, while the others continued in the work of res
cuing.
Pile after pile of wood disappeared, when suddenly there was a cessation of labor.
Half a dozen men kneeled and took up the form of a man, bruised, bleeding and
covered from head to foot with plaster. He was hurried to a patrol wagon and laid on
the stretcher.
A physician who clambered on the hub of one of the wheels felt his pulse and told
the officer in charge ?â¢ there is life in him still; rush him to the hospital."
The police were on hand and had much difficulty in establishing lines to keep
back the great crowds that had gathered from all sides to gam a view of the ruins and
the work of rescue. It was a lons time until there was order sufficient to enable all
who were willing to work to proceed uninterruptedly.
Before the firemen arrived the crowd
had dug from beneath the ruins on the
sidewalk the mangled corpse of an old
woman â a mere passer-by who had met
death through the criminal economy of
those whose business it is to be careful of
life.
"She is alive," shouted the man nearest
the motionless form and his cry was taken
up by the thousands who had gathered,
more from an indefinable feeling that
something terrible had happened rather
than from any true knowledge of the ex
act condition of affairs.
"You are mistaken, my friend," said a
white-haired old gentleman vho had
joined the rescuers, "she is dead."
Then the cry was taken up, and long
before the body was clear of the debris
the people in that vast throng for blocks
around were telling to each other how an
old woman had met death. What was
worse, she was unknown. No one seemed
to know whence she came or whither she
was going.
But the dead woman was forgotten
momentarily at least, in toe mad but
earnest desire to rescue the living, if there
were any, from ttje mass of smoldering
ruins, thirty, yes, forty, feet high, which
threatened with each gust of wind to

burst into a seething pile of flames. For
tunately at this moment Chief Sullivan,
with half a dozen engines at his back, ar
rived. A steady flow of water for a few
moments sufficed to assure those who still
lived within the ruins that if death was to
come before they could be rescued, it
would not take the form of flame and
smoke.
Tnen the real work of relief began. .Fully
half a thousand determined hands, spurred
on by the good-will of thousands, attacked
the huge mass of splinters and shattered
timbers. The heavy smoke and still heavier
steam rising from the incipient lires below
half blinded and strangled them at first,
but there were lives to be saved, and they
stopped for nothing.
Timbers flew right and left, and in ten
minutes Fifth street resembled closely the
remains of the building which had so sud
denly mained or killed nearly a score of
people. Near the top of the pile were
probably a hundred men, many with axes,
and all with a tool of some character, seek
ing to cut through the roof and ceiling.
They knew that death alone did not walk
in the shattered structure, for heartrend
ing cries, faint, but clear, could be heard.
Finally the timbers were cleared away,
and Miss Pearl Woodward was lifted from
her treacherous position. The multitude2

sent up a great shout when they saw
that she was practically unharmed.
Mr.Â«, J. H. Mahler was next taken out,
and then Miss Bessie Wilson. The three
women were hurried to a neighboring un
dertaking establishment, where several of
the Keceiving Hospital corps had estab
lished headquarters for such cases as were
not considered dangerous.
"I was not frightened for ever so long
after the building collapsed," said Miss
Woodward. "I was never at any time un
c QSCions, but the whole thing was so sud
den that I did not have time to think of
anything except to make a vain effort to
grasp something solid. I heard a low,
rumbling pound, and then without any
warn ina the floor dropped from under me
and I went down, down, down, bringing
up finally with a jolt that seemed near
shattering my teeth.
"I thought I must be dreaming, and
then like a flash it came to me that the
building had collapsed. I called for help,
but my voice was drowned in noise on the
outside, which came plainly and painfully
to me in my narrow prison. I was more
afraid of tire than anything else, but when
1 heard the roar of the engines I knew
that I would be rescued in time."
In the meantime the firemen and the
hundred or so volunteers continued the
work of rescue. One by one the victims
were taken from the ruins.
Jesse May was the Stth person dug|from
out tbe debris, and it was at once seen
that he was badly injured, and two-thirds
of those who gazed on his blood-stained
face pronounced him dead, but some
thought differently.
"His heart beats!" exclaimed Dr. Fitz
girÂ«bon. "There is yet a chance to save
his life. Get him to the hospital as quickly
as possible.'' But poor May was beyond
all human aid.
The very life had been crushed out of
him by the tons of falling timbers, and he
was only breathing because his magnifi
cent physique would not give up the fight
until forced to the last trench. This it
did soon after reaching the hospital.
It was a sorrowful sight, the hauling
out of the maimed and wounded from the
deathtrap. In all ten were taken to the
Receiving Hospital, only one of whom nas :
bo far died. It is thought, however, that ,
at least five more will succumb.
During the work of the rescue of the liv- 5
ing and the hunt for the dead Chief Sulli- i
van was everywhere. His men labored
together like co many automatons, with ;
the difference that they worked intelli
gently and systematically. A hundred
hands grasped the long ropes made fast to
the fallen walls and partitions and pulled
away as though their own lives depended
on the issue. It was an orderly, earnest
gathering, working solely for suffering
humanity.
One of the lirst articles brought to light j
was what had once been a handsome bird !
cage. It was crushed into an unrecogniz
kble mass, hut in one corner just large i
enough to hold its wee body was a canary
without even a ruffled feather to bear cvi- 1
dence to the terrible scene through which !
it had just pasted.
Some of the workmen were caught like
rats in a trap and were unabie to escape
from under the weight of the mass that i
crushed upon them.
Those who were at work on the north
tide of the foundation were more for- j
tunate, for when the floor sank on the
south side the timbers on the other end !
rested in part on the cribs and against the
southern wall of the building on the ;
north, leaving a triangular space from '
which they were able to crawl out and be 1
lifted to the sidewalk. One of these was j
Cornelius Croning, a hod-carrier, who was j
cut across the chest by a scantling that i
struck him; another was Thomas Malan
dry, another hod-carrier.
Two brick-cleaners, as well as Byron
Bailey, a carpenter, escaped with slight
bruises.
James Daley was one of the fortunate
laborers who was under the bouse engaged
in working the jackscrews. and on hear
ing the crushing noise of the limbers
overhead dropped his tools and rushed
out from underneath the building just in
time to have the plaie where he had been
at work a few seconds before covered o\er
With heavy timbers from the flooring

Mike Howard was another of the for
tunate ones who escaped from under the
house before the crash came. He, like
Daley, beard the timbers creak above him
and ran and saved his life.
Joseph Hicks, one of the first on the
scene, rushed on the fallen roof and suc
ceeded in rescuing Mrs. Byrnes by haul

which she was. He assisted her to a house

J. G. KÂ«own, a veteran fireman, secured
!an ax and, cutting a hole in the roof,
j managed to rescue four men and two

i this incident.

caught in the timbers.
About half-past 5 o'clock a piteous little
whine could be heard above the noise of
the chopping and the splinterins of the de
bris as the men worked like bearers upon
; the top of the avalanche of r>roken boards,
timbers and plaster near the rear wall of
: the wreck. The sound grew more audibie
each moment as parts of the imprisoned
', roof of wreckage were being steadily
! hurled aside, and then a very little dog
suddenly dashed out through the first
available opening, frisk ing about and wag
ging his bushy tail. He was soon grabbed
up by a sympathetic but dirty-faced little
boy, who disappeared down Mint avenue
; hugging the pretty little black-and-white
1 creature to his breast.
During the course of the afternoon sev
'â¢ eral men more venturous than the rest
! forced their way under the building to see
; if they could render any assistance to the
men who were pinioned under the wreck
: age. They succeeded in reaching one of
, the laborers, who was taken to the Receiv
, ing Hospital, but they were unable to
I reach the others.
The young woman, Pearl Woodward,
i who was rescued through the roof is the
I one who some time since donned a diver'B
suit and walked under tbe water at Sutro
baths.
Every patrol- wagon had been called into
requisition to take the injured to the Re
ceiving Hospital, and as they drove np to
the entrance they attracted an immense
crowd of men, women and chile ren, all
eager to learn bow the maimed men and
women came Dy their injuries.
Drs. Thompson and Hartley and Stew
ards Bucher and Mogan worked like beav
ers stitching aud dressing the wounds,
and in an incredibly short space of time
the wounded were properly attended to.
Friends and relatives of some of the
injured were present and it was pitiful to
hear their pleadings to the doctors and
stewards to hurry up and attend to the
one they cared for.
Nine of those injured were taken to the
hospital, and one man, whose name could
not be ascertained, died on the way. He
was supposed to be one of the graders.
With one exception, none of the nine were
dangerously injured.
Patrick McKeown, husband of the pro
prietor of the rooming-house, was seri
ously injured internally. He was in a
room on the middle floor and was jammed
between two beams.
Mrs. Joseph Byrne, McKeown's sister
in-law, was also in her room on the mid
dle floor. She had been on top of the
building putting out some clothes to day
and had just returned to her room
when tbe floor sank down. Mrs. Silver
stein, an old lady, had been talking to her,
and when they were dragged out of the
ruins Mrs. Silverstein was dead. Mrs.
Byrne had a narrow escape. A dressing
case fell on top of her and left a clear
space of a lew inches above her. When
found she had her arms around the dress
ing-case. Her only injury was a contusion
on each of her arms. When ehe saw tier
broth er-in-law sitting in a chair in the
hospital bent almost double she gave a
scream, threw her arms around him and
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JTJXE 23, 1896.
kissed him. McKeown calmed her by
saying he was all right.
Miss Sarah Byrne was upstairs in her
room when the building collapsed. She
was hysterical when taken to the hospital,
and eaid she could remember nothing
after hearing the cracking of the walls.
Her right arm was broken, her right thigh
injured and she had a deep wound in her
scalp, but her skull was not fractured.
Richard Buckley, porter in the coffee
house, escaped with a cut on the forehead
received from a falling plank.
Emile Leuenberger of 431 Minna street
was in bed in one of the rooms on the top
floor. He heard a crash, then the plaster
cracked and the floor sank. He was
found among the debris of the bed. A
lady friend who was talking to him at the
time escaped without a scratch, Leuen
berger assisting to drag her out. Leuen
bereer's left side was badly contused and
he was suffering from internal injuries.
H. Shepherd, a hotel employe, was in
his room on the top floor. A beam fell on
i his cnest, knocking him down, and he
sank among the ruins. His right foot was
broken.
Dennis Griffin, 21 Page street, a hod
| carrier's laborer, was worse injured than
j any of tte oihers. He was working under
| neath the building at the time of the col
| lapse. He had an ugly cut over his eve
| brow and he was badly injured internally.
! He complained of severe pains in his
i thighs, but no bones were found to be
broken. He has a wife and child.
Simeon Deane, 1209 Union street, was
' also workine underneath the building. He
had two wounds in his scalp, one being
long and deep, but the skull was not frac
tured.
Jobn Lyons, 154 Clara street, a hod-car
rier, was going up a ladder with a hodful
of bricks when the building collapsed.
He was dragged out of the debris by S. M.
Scott, manager of the Manhattan Rubber
Company, who accompanied him to the
hospital. The blood was spurting from a
cnt artery in Lyons' right wrist when
Scott dragged him out, and Scott made a
tourniquet from a broken cigar-box and
a handkercnief and probably saved him
from bleeding to death. Lyons was also
cut on the scalp, but after having his
wounds attended to he was able to go
home with his wife, who had hurried to
the hospital.
One of the most pitfful sights at the hos
pital was tbat of a Mrs. Davis, who called
to see if her husband was among the in
jured. She said he had been working un
derneath tne building. She was assured
that he was not there, and just then her
eyes rested upon the sheet covering the
dead man. With a shriek she threw down
the sheet, gazed upon the dead man's face
and fell into a tit of hysterical sobbing when
she found he was not her husband. She
crew calmer, and some on? said in her
hearing that there were two or three men
yet in the ruins, and she rushed out of the
hospital in the direction of Fifth street
with the tears streaming down her face.
Last night Grilh'n and McKeown were in
a critical condition and faint hopes were
entertained of their recovery. They were
both very severely injured internally.
MRS. McKEOWN'S STORY.
The Landlady of the Brighton Tells
of the Fall.
Mrs. K. McKeown, a woman about 30 years
of age, who managed the two upper floors
as a lodging-house, was one of the first to
be rescued from the wreck. She was cut
behind the left ear, slightly injured about
the hands and severely bruised over the
left hip.
Removed at once to the lodging-house in
the rear she was soon visited by a physi
cian, who pronounced her injuries not
dangerous. She had not yet received defi
nite assurance of the safety of her hus
band, and her first inquiry was for news
of him.
Being assured that he had been removed
to the Receiving Hospital with only a
comparatively slight gash across the
cheek, Mrs. McKeown told the following
story of the experience through which she
had passed:
4'l was on the top floor, in tbe hall. All
at once it commenced to rumble and it
grew dark, and the ceiling began to fall in
great, big pieces. Everything started to
slide and it got terribly dark in just a
second or two.
"There were seven or eight of us, I guess,
altogether on the third floor. Nobody, I
think, was on the floor below. There was
my husband and one other man, Gus
Sprouse, Mrs. Eugenia Byrne, her daugh
ter, Miss Sarah Byrne, Mrs. John Waller,
Mis 3 May Wardâ all roomersâ and Mrs.
Yager, who does the housework.
"I was in room 16 and Mrs. Byrne was
right opposite, in room 17, while Miss
Ward was In room 18. When the lirst
crash came I rushed into the hall. 1 was
there when the rest happened.
"It didn't seem that I fell very far. I
was picked up at once on top of the pile.
The men rescued me about three minutes
after the crash. I w.aa out in plain sight
and above everything, only I was caught
by the beams and held by my hips so I
couldn't get loose.
"My loss? I think what I lost in fur
niture and other things was worth about
$2000."
Mrs. McKeown was injured more
seriously than she first believed. Three
physicians examined her injuries at the
undertaking establishment of McAvoy &
Gallagher, where she was taken immedi
ately after the accident They found that
three ribs were brofcen besides the severe
wound on her head. After she was treated
her anxiety for her husband prompted her
to visit the Receiving Hospital. After
standing about she was finally taken by
friends to the residence of Sirs. John
Murphy on Hayes street, her cousin.
Last night while suffering extreme pain
she repeated in substance the above story,
and said. that Mrs. Silverstein was calling
on her yesterday afternoon and had just
left her. She was at the time on the top
floor and was descending tue stairs when
the crash came. Then she says every
thing grew dark and she felt the heavy
beam bearing down on her side. She saw
the daylight and pushed aside the beam.
Ii was then that the men rescued her.

WHERE MEN WERE EATING.
Scene In the Coffee SaJoon When
the Building Collapsed.
There were a few stains of blood on the
white cravat of Martin A. C. Christenssn,
as he viewed the ruin of his coffee-house
after the crash. He endeavored to con
verse with John Hansen, his cook, who,
in white apron and cap, was nursing a
bruised arm on the street.
"Three men customers were sitting at
the tables," he said, as he began to review
the situation, "and I was behind the desk
working on the books.
"The windows began to rattle, and right
away there was a noise of crashing up
above. Everybody made a break for the
ooor. The; got outâ the three men,
my three Waiters, the cook here, J. Han
sen, ar.d his two assistants in the kitchen.
There was another waiter named Chris
Jakenson (in English Johnson), he bas not
shown up yet. I don't know if he was in
the building at all.
"I bought out my partner a year ago for
$5000. Then I spent $2000 last July in
fitting up the place and refurnishing it.
My loss must be $10,000. Anyway I
wouldn't have sold out lor that.
"The building has been sinking the last
couple of years. I complained to the
proprietor a year ago, just after the prop
erty changed hands. When the contractor
came the other day to examine the under
pinning he said he was surprised the
building had stood so long with such
rotten foundation.
"The men just started to-day to put in
brick work. They have been on the job
about two weeks. I thinfc there were
twelve or fourteen of them at work in the
basement."
"And I," added the cook, "was in the
kitchen with Frank, the porter, the dish
washer, whose name I do nol know, and
Chris, a waiter. Tlie slide came and
everything went and I don't know how I
got out, but I think I was pulled out
through the roof. The other men all got
out; but I think there was one customer
in the men's part of the restaurant, but I
think he got out."
"Were there any ladies in the ladies'
saloon?" he asked the proprietor, who de
clared that he could not tell.
Christensen was watching until after
midnight in front of his old place of busi
ness. Not satisfied with having saved bis
life he moaned over the fact that there was
$40 in a cigar-box and $60 in the cash reg
ister, all of which he did not think would
ever be reached by him. In the debris he
also had a safe containing $500 winch he
confidently hoped to recover.
â¦ ,
THE COLLAPSED BUILDING.
Those Who Were the Occupants of
the Structure.
The building was known as Nos. 20 and
22 Fifth street. Ii had 25 feet front by a
depth of 75 feet. The ground floor was oc
cupied as a lunch-house and coffee-saloon,
kept by Martin A. C. Christensen, while
the two upper floors were occupied by
Mrs. K. McKeown, who keDt a lodging
house known as "The Brighton."
The building was erected a number of
years aj;o on the slight style of construc
tion prevalent in thoae days. A few weeks
ago it was noticed that the foundation was
not as secure as it ought to be. Samuel
O'Kelly of 312 Ellis street, the owner, con
cluded to have a new foundation placed
under it. He secured the services of an
architect, Edmund Kollopotto of 9H3
Market street, to prepare plans for the
work of improvement.
This having been done, the contrnct for
the necessary repairs was let to Adam
Miller of 404 Kearny street, who sublet
the contract for grading to Levi B. Sibley
of 1305 Howard street; and the one for
placing the building on cribs and screws
was let to P. W. Gleeson of 309 Mason
street.
The foundation was found to be exceed
ingly weak, and it became necessary to
prop up the structure with iackscrews
and cribs, as house movers and raisers
use.
These rested on a sandy bottom, but
whether this was responsible for the col
lapse it was impossible last night to de
termine. It was the opinion of some who
claimed a knowledge of such matters that
the sand ut some point had caused the
building to topple and fall.
It was the intention to place a brick
foundation under the building, and for
that purpose there were at work a number
of hod-carriers, bricklayers and car
penters.
About a year ago the old building and
the property on which it stood were

THINGS WERE AWRY.
Two Men Who Believe That Some-
body Was Culpable.
R. E. Saunders, who lives in the lodging
house immediately adjoining on the west,
said: "I had been working under the
house and had left only a few days ago,
because 1 thought I was not sufficiently
paid. I thought when I left that too much
water was allowed to run on the sand of
the foundation. The workmen had cut
holes in the water pipe and let out the
water in order to soften the founda
tion. The sand was completely saturated
with the water, and I was fearful when I
saw it tbat an accident might happen."
Frank Coleman, who works in tbe Cali
fornia Hotel, occupied a room on the mid
die floor. He was unaware of the acci
dent until told later in the afternoon. He
said :
"Last night I endeavored to get into my
room, but the door was so sagged tnat I
was unable to open it. I was obliged to
awaken the landlady, Mrs. McKeown,
who told me that a new foundation was
being placed under the building. After
much effort I at last succeeded in opening
the door.
"Mrs. McKeown told me at that time
that she had consulted the landlord, and
that he had told her that everythin-r was
perfectly safe and that there was nothing
to worry about. The only way that I can
account for tlie accident is that it was
owing to carelessness on the contractor's
part."
A DANGEROUS HOUSE.
The Police Take Possession of a
House That Is Out of Plumb.
About 5 o'clock in the afternoon Police
Commissioner Tobin appeared on the
scene, and he and Police Captain Spillane
ad their attention called to the three
story bulding adjoining tbe fallen one on
the north. They noticed that it was no
longer plumb, but was leaning to the
isoiuh.
They at once summoned Fire Marshal
Towe, who agreed with them that all the
inmates should be given notice to vacate.
This was done at once by the police, and
three oilicers were placed on j;uard, with
instructions not to allow any one to re
enter. The Fire Marshal then served a
notice on Charles Finey, the owner, to
secure it with shoring-posts without delay.
The Fire Marshal viewed the debris for
hours after the disaster. He shook his
head in an ominous way saying:
"This is very rouph when you stop to
consider that not only several human be
ings have been crushed to death, but that
scores of people might have met with the
same fate.
"You see that building over there," he
said, pointing at 20 Fifth street, the frame
and brick two-story next to the one that
fell. "The studding is only 2x4 on the
first two stories and even less on the top
stories. The building is not built even to
bear the weight of the bricks.
"Nowadays we will not allow studding
to go up smaller than 4x6. But this build
ing was put up years ago in a most crim
inal fashion."
â¢ â¦â
SAVED BY THIRST.
The Narrow Escape of E. S. Abbott
of Ninth Street.
E. S. Abbott of 12 Ninth street probably
owes his life to a glass of beer, fo|r just be
fore the fall he was on the temporary
bridge that had been constructed over the
undermined sidewalk in front of the death
trap, ile felt a thirst coming on and
sought a neighboring saloon to discuss a
foaming schooner.
When about to return to his former po
sition he was delayed on the sidewalk by
the voice of a friend calling to him to
come and "have something," and as he
diplomatically hesitated before the dont
carerido be says tie saw two women and a
little child on the footbridge, beard the
crashing of glass and the breaking of tim- ;
bers, and saw the trio hasten wildly off
the platform, so quickly in fact that one
woman dropped her cloak and tbe other
let her pocketbook fall. And then the
crash and crush came.
The Identified Dead.
Those who were killed, as appears from
the records at the Morgue, are Ernestine
Silverstine of 284 Stevenson street, and on
whose body was found a purse with a small
sum of money and a bankbook showing a
deposit of $900. She leaves a brother, Ja
cab Levy.
Jesse May died while being conveyed to
the hospital, a laborer, 55 y ears of age, who
lived at 1662 Market street.
Stlll In the Ruins.
It was reported at a late hour last night
that there were still three bodies in the
ruins: Lemmon, a bricklayer; Jobn Mc-
Carthv, a bricklayer, a son of tbe man
who discovered a cinnabar mine on his
property in the Western Addition a few
years ago; and Michael Konrke, a hod
carrier.
The contractors were unable to furnish
the names of all the men in their employ,
and that fact added to the difficulty of
determining how many men were missing.
George Connen of 220 Dore street, who
went to work on the building yesterday
morning, and Charles Kiordan, a carpen
ter whose home is on Dolores street and
who had been working for several days on
the building, were reported missing.
Rsstinsr From Rescue.
At about 11:30 last evening the Fire De
partment was withdrawn from the scene
of the wreck as there war, no further need
of its services. All search for bodies wa-*
abandoned until to-day, when a thorough
investigation will be made and the ques
tion settled as to wh tner any more per
sons perished in the catastrophe.
Down among the ruins one more sur
vivor was rescued and extracted from dan
| perous and close quarters. It was a
! parrot belonging to Joseph Burnes, one of
\ lodger?. It was uninjured but full of
I fight, and bit the hand of the police officer
that carried it from the wreck, till the
blood came.
Alterinsr Buildings.
Alterations or repairs to frame build
ings within the fire limits, and this build-
! ing was within ancb, cannot be made with
; out a permit obtained from either;the Fire
. Wardens or the Board of Supervisors, but
: this does not entail upon either of these
powers any authority to perform any other
function than that of seeing that the al
terations or repairs are in excess of those
mentioned in the permit. The wardens
do not watch the progress of the work.
Aid for th i Sufferers.
W. E. Johns, manager of the Park
Theater, has made arrangements to lend
assistance to the sufferers by yesterday's
| accident in a way tbat is at once practical,
substantial and timely. The entire re
i ceipts of the theater, on Friday evening
; will be devote. i to this charitable purpose

send 20,000 of the new troops, when they
arrive, to the province of Pinar del Rio,
where they will be employed in crushing
i, and the other 20,000 will be used to
strengthen the Jucaro trocha. These re
ent'orcements will enable General Weyler
to dispense with the services of the volun
teers who are at present doing garrison
duty.
Andres Hernandez Rodriguez and Mig

2XTEKESTIXG INCIDENT.
Etnbassador Eustis Sares the Life of a
Frenchman in Cubn.
PARIS, France, June 22.â 1n the course
of conversation with a high official of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the corre
spondent ol the United Press learned yes
t r day of an interesting' incident of the
Cuban war in which J. iJ. Eustis, the
American Emba~sador to France, was in
strumental in saving a French citizen
from death at the hands of the Spanish
military authorities In Cuba.
me time ago Eustis received from
America a cablegram B'nt by a promi
compatriot, stating that a young
Frenchman had been arrested by the
Spaniards and was about to be shot on
account of h;s sympathies for the revo
lutionists. Thn prisoner's brother had
formerly saved the life of the sender of
the dispatch, who appealed to Eustis to
take what steps he could to save the
prisoner from Spanish butchery.
An appeal to the humanity and generos
ity of Eustis ahvay3 meets with an imme
diate response, and the Embassador at
once drove to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and acquainted the Minister with
the news he had received. Neither the
Foreign Minister nor M. Nisand, the per
manent chief of the Department of Politi
cal Affairs, were even aware that a French
citizen was on the eve of execution in
Cuba, and dispatches were forwarded to
Madrid and to the French Consul at
Havana without delay.
irtly afterward Eustis had the satis
faction of learning from the Minister that
the negotiations with the Spanish Gov
ernment had resulted in the young
Frenchman's release. The thanks of the
French Government for Eustis' kindly
initiative were joined" to the information.
It transpired that when the Spanish
authorities arrested the young Frenchman
the French Consul merely forwarded to
Paris a report by mail, which would only
a r rived here after his compatriot had
been executed. Hence the ignorance of
the French Government of the imminent
execution, which Mr. Eustis' intervention
prevented.
The brother of tbe rescued man is a
well-known physician in Philadelphia.

Xothiny in Lot's Report to Keep the
President From Fishing.
Washington; D. C, June 22.â There
was a rumor here this afternoon that the
State Department would issue a statement
about Cuban affairs apropos of the an
nouncement that Consul-General Lee had
sent a report to the President which would
form the basis for action on the situation
on the island. The rumor was erroneous.
It was learned, however, that the State
Department was confident that no report
on which a decisive policy could be framed
had been sent. General Lee has been in
Cuba a few weeks only and has not left
Havana in that lime.
It was remarked by an official that, the
President would not have gone fishing if
he. expected critical dispatches. Mr.
land's delay in starting for Gray
Gables is pointed to in some quarters as
giving coior to the story, although it is ad
mitted that be and Secretary Olncy could
consider the alleged rej>ort, if such a thing
existed, quite as well at their adjacent
summer homes in Massachusetts as in
Washington.
Mr. Ryan, the supposed bearer of the
dispatch, now in quarantine in New York,
went to Cuba of his own volition and had
I o ntiicial connection with General Lee or
the State Department.

Consul-General Lee's Stay at Havana
31 ay Be Brief.
MADRID, Spain, June 22.â The Govern
ment is still uninformed officially of the
report which General Fitzhugh Lee, the
American Consul-General at Havana, has
made to his Government anent the situa
tion in Cuba. If the tenor of the report is
as stated in unofficial dispatches received
here it will make General Lee's slay in
Havana difficult.
The Senate to-day debated the questions
of the relations between Spain and the
Uniied Mates. Professor Comas de
manded that the protocol of 1877 with the
United .States be denounced. The speech
of Professor Comas was loudly applauded.
Senor Castellanos, Minister of the Col
onies, submitted a bill asking for united
authority to raise loans to continue oper
ations in Cuba.
Another bill was introduced proposing
the restoration of reciprocity with Ger
many.

KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 22.â 1t is re

Spanish warship attempted a few days ago
to commit a high-handed outrage on Brit

landed at Dry Harbor and attempted to
kidnap a Cuban residing there, who is
prominently connected with the insurrec
tion in Cuba. The attempt failed and the
Cuban appealed to the British authorities
for protection, which was granted. A
number of armed policemen are now pa

house. Thej* are instructed to prevent,
by all nieans, any attempt to carry off the

HAVANA, Ciba, June 22.â Despite the
recent announcement that no active
operations would be carried on against the

Munoz, Melguizo and Valcarcel have re
ceived orders to inaugurate in the prov
ince of Pinar del Rio important opera

CLAMOR FOR AySEXATIOS.
Cubans Want to lie Taken Into Uncle
Stem's Fold.
QUARANTINE, S. 1., June 22.â William
Ryan of Richmond, Collector of Internal
Revenue for the Eastern District of Vir
ginia, who has been visiting friends in
Cuba, and who, it is said, is the bearer of
dispatches from General Fitzhugh Lee to
tbe State Department, was a passenger on
the War i iine steamer Yumuri, which ar
rived to-day. Along with a number of
other persons from the tropical zone, he
is quarantined at Hoffman Island, but
will be released to-morrow morning.
Mr. Ryan fays the Cubans are more
clamorous than ever for annexation to the
United States and that while a few repre
sentative men of the island express some
doubt as to the possibility of annexation,
the great majority regard such a thing as
at once practical and desirable for both the
United States and Cuba aa the one solu
tion of the situation. Sooner or later, the
Cubans say, annexation must surely be
accomplished. The members of the au
tonomist party no longer discuss auton
omy or home rule under the Spanish flag.
They seem to be the chief agitators for
American annexation.
When asked about his friend, General
Fitzhugh Lee. the American Consul-Gen
eral to Cuba, Mr. Ryan said he left him in
excellent health and spirits and very busy;
th;it he was making a thorough aiid im
partial study of the situation and that he
was just now at work on a report to ttie
State Department. Being a thorough sol
dier and a man of affairs, General Lee was
thoroughly adapted for the difficult task
which he had undertaken. As to the bias
of General Lee's report Mr. Ryan could
not say. He expects, however, to remain
in Havana throughout the summer.
REFUSE PAY IN SILVER,
Foreign Laborers in Pennsylva
nia Excited by a Political
Agitator.
Strikfe for Gold When Told That the
American Dollar Is Worth Only
Fifty Cents.
HAZLETON, Pa., June 22. â The
monthly paydays of many of the contrac
tors of this region were in the past week,
and considerable trouble was experienced
in paying off the foreign element. They
refused to take paper or silver money.
For the last week or two Anthony Reitz,
a well-educated Austrian who speaks sev
eral languages, has been among tbe for
eigners and put it into their heads that
the silver dollar was not worth more than
50 cents, and when any foreigner expressed
a doubt regarding his statement he read
extracts from an American newspaper to
substantiate his argument.
Jacob Ho an, a contractor, who is build
ing the reservoir at Buck Mountain, em
ploys 300 men who had listened to Reitz's
arguments, and the result was that the
men heid a meeting and decided they
would ail be cold men, not only politically,
but commercially, and that their labor
should be traded on a sound-money basis
only.
Reitz, who is an under-boss, communi
cated this fact to Contractor Hogan Thurs
day. The men were to be paid their
month's wages on Saturday. It did not
strike Hogan at that time that there
would be any difficulty in paying tbe men
in gold. He called at his bank and de
manded $I'JOO in gold. He was struck
dumb when the teller told him he could
not get that sum in the entire county.
Out of $11,000,000 on deposit in the several
banks of the county it is estimated that
scarcely half the required amount of gold
is in circulation.
The laborers, however, have refused to
go beyond the $f> limit on silver, and the
contractor is very much embarrassed in
consequence.

FOR THE SHERMAN HANDICAP.
List of Starters and Thtir Jockeys in
the Ilia Race.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 22.â The entry
list for tne SnburDan handicap to be run
to-morrow was made public this after
noon. The following are the announced
starters and their jockeys:
Henry of Navarre, Griffin.
Nankipooh, Doggett.
Hornpipe, Hamilton.
Sir Walter, Ballard.
Belmar, Simms.
Clifford. Taral.
The Commoner, Clayton.
The race promises to be one of the best
suburbans in years, for none but the best
horses in training are left in. The track
was very heavy last night after the rain,
but it has been drying out fast to-day, and,
except in some places, was in a fairly good
condition this afternoon. Superintend
ent Park said it would be as fast as at any
time since it was built, and trainers agreed
with him.
Clifford and Navarre each did their last
work in 2:10, and both Rogers and Hyland,
their respective trainers, think the race
lies between them, although they have a
high respect for The Commoner.

In the stomach. Tlie remainder of the round

the rintf. His ex liiii it ion oi footwork was Kim
ply wonderful. Toward the close of the round
Ryan led twice, landing on the neck.

struck the nir. Ryan retaliated with his left
on the stomach and tue right and left on the

tion. Ryan landed a terrific left on the jaw,
the round ending.with a clinch.
Round 5â Ryan put his left on the point of
Maker's jaw. Maber countered lightly. A
left on Maber's nose earned first blood for

Round oâ Ryan did all the leadinp, landing
left and right on the ribs, making Matter
wince. The latter put his left on the neck.
Round 7â Maber put in his left and right on
the jaw, but they were too light to do much
damage. Ryan swung with ri^ht for the body,
but missed. Maber put his right on the jaw

hard drive on the rios. Ryan jabbed Maber
in the stomach and followed it up with a

Round 8â There was a light interchange, the
first blow of consequence being Ryan's left on
Miibers kidneys.

round. He played repeatedly for Maber's kid
neys and landed half a dozen times. A lively
Interchange followed, and a heart blow dou
bled Maber up. He was carried to his corner
and his seconds gnve up the fight.
There were two prelim inary bouts be
fore the Maber-Ryan fight. The first was

MINISTER TORU TALKS,
While Speeding East He Repeats
His Nice Sentiments About
America.
Japan, He Declares, Cannot Be Cal le 1
a Rival to the United
States.
OMAHA, Nekr., June 22.â Hosbi Toru,
the newly appointed Minister from Japan
to the United States, passed through tnis
city to-day on his way East. In an inter
view on political and economic questions
he said :
*'I am no stranger in America, having
been here before on two occasions. I have
never before, however, been over the
Union Pacific or the overland route, I be
lieve you cal! it, having on my previous
trips gone by way of the Canadian Pacific.
lam much pleased by the new route, and
if you do not call it an advertisement I
would like to have you say this: Japan
has made wonderful progress in all lines
of manufacturing products, but I don't
think that the country can be called a rival
of the United States. Our factories are still
in their infancy, and it will be many years
before we can really be said' to be competi
tors of the United States. We have com
mittees now en route to this country to
inspect your electrical progress. You aiv
not to believe from this that we are wholly
deficient in this regard in our country,
but we are always looking for an improve
ment in everything that we have.
"As regards the late war, I don't believe
that tbe war feeling has entirely died out;
what you would call patriotism is still
manifest throughout the country.
"As regards Korea, it is true that both
Russia and Japan have a watchful eye
over it, but it is an independent country.
The relations between Japan and Russia
are most friendly.
"Americaâ and by America I mean the
United Statesâ has always had a warm
place in the hearts of the Japanese, and
we have for everything pertaining to the
United States a most warm and enthusi
astic feeling. There is no danger in the
world of Japan becoming a formidable foe
to your industries."

INTENDED AS AN
OLIVE BRANCH,
Whitney's Letter in the
Nature of a Silver
Compromise.
IS INSPIRED BY GROVER.
But the Administration Men Are
Rather Late in Their
Work.
SOUNDING ALL THE DELEGATES
Determinfd but Futile Attempts to
Turn a Majority to the
Gold Standard.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 22.â The
letter of ex-Secretary Whitney is regarded
. by Democrats here as being in the nature
of a compromise tendered the free-silver
wing of the Democratic party. Mr. "Whit
j ney is understood as receding from the
I single-gold standard assumed by President
Cleveland in his recent interview, and
favoring a straddle on "international bi-
m etallism." For weeks it has been con
ceded that the free-silver element will
control the Chicago convention, not only
Dy a majority, but by a more than two
thirds vote, thus insuring the naming of
an out-and-out silver candidate, to stand
upon a free-coinage platform.
At the eleventh hour, after three-fourths
of tfie delegates to the approaching con
! vention had been selected, and after Mr.
Cleveland had issued a proclamation de
â  daring in favor or gold monometallism,
; without any redeeming sop to the disaf
fected faction of the party, Mr. Whitney
is persuaded to forego a European trip and
step into the breach with an olive branch
of peace. The olive branch i-xtended by
Mr. Whitney is the same old declaration
regarding the international bimetallism
I that has appeared in the platform of the
dominant political parties for many Na
tional campaigns. It means nothing, it is
i said, and is on the alleged principle of
' homeopathic remedies which are said to
ido no harm, even if they do no good. In
i short, Mr. Whitney has been selected to
| head a movement intended to prevent
| silver supremacy at the Chicago conven-
I tion, and, failing in the attempt, to offer
' bimetallism as a harmonizing compro
j misc.
This is regarded as the meat in the
| cocoanut, so far as Mr. Whitney's letter is
I concerned. Whitney will receive the
; earnest support of every prominent Fed
i eral office-holder, beginning with the
President. The first practical move in
that direction made here was to secure a
list of all delegates-elect to the Chicago
j convention. More than two-thirds of
these have been chosen. All delegates
chosen who are either instructed for silver
or are believed to incline to silver will at
: once be communicated with personally,
! and the delegations lor weeks past have
| been receiving "sound money" literature
; from the New York and Boston reform
| clubs, but they will now, it is asserted,
1 be solicited by letter. Efforts will also be
â  made to ascertain their standing in their
I communities and what influence, if any,
of a local or National nature can be
I brought to bear upon them to change
their views on the money question. To

Preside wiJl be written to for information^
| and when in hand this information, with
i any political pressure that can be brought
from their fellow-Democrats, locally or
j nationally, will be utilized in the direction
I of the well-known views of the adminis-
tration.
The President and ex-Secretary Whit
ney have commenced their campaign too
late. They are locking the stable door
after the horse has been stolen. It is
pointed out that their standing for the
views of the administration have been
beaten at every turn. Secretary Carlisle
tried to save Kentucky, but only one dis
trict in the State pronounced for gold.
Senator Bryce has been completely
routed in Ohio, and the State Convention
Which meets to-morrow will be almost
unanimous for free silver. Secretary
Smith took the stump in Georgia until he
lost his temper and ex-Speaker Crisp lost
his voice, but the result was an over
whelming administration defeat. Secre
tary Herbert could not control his own
State of Alabama. Nebraska slip]>edÂ°away
from Secretary Morton. Attorney-General
Harmon will not even try to stem the tide
in Ohio. Will the fate of free silver de
pend upon a union of Western Republican
States with the Southern Democratic
States? Must there be a coalition of
Western Republican silverites with the
Democrats of the South? And if this
combination is effected what ticket that
may be named for President and Vice-
President can deieat McKmley and Ho
bart? Union of effort means a union
ticketâ a man from the West and a man
from the South.
The Republicans of the West claim the
right to name the man for first place. Dis
putes forward Mr. Teller. And, more
than that, the West insists that he must
be taken. The West has no words of dis
paragement for the Southern leaders, but
Mr. Teller, as :t believes, is the one man
in the whole country who by his ag
gressive services stands most eminently
and distinctly for silver's cause, and there
fore the man to represent it this year.
Teller himself is silent, but available. He
knows what is going on in his interests,
and he is not objecting. Mr. Dubois, hi->
protege and bosom friend, and now also
liis fellow-bolter and representative, puts
the case with entire frankness. Effective
union is impossible without Mr. Teller as
the enndidate.
For second place several strong men are
mentioned. They are, of course, South
ern men, and thoroughly representative
of their section. Any one of them would
be entirely acceptable to the Western
man. Daniel of Virginia is one of these.
He is a typical Southern man. He has
always stood for silver. He was in the
company of those who resisted with all
their might the repeal of the purchasing
clause of the Sherman act. Being a
speaker of high repute, he is put forward
in the debates, and tackles the biggest of
the goldbugs.
Captain Evan Howell of the Atlanta
Constitution is mentioned. Captain Howel 1
has never held ofiice, but with his pen has
done a great deal for silver. Georgia's po
sition in the silver line is accredited as
much to his influence as to that exerted
by Mr. Crisp. The two men have worked
together in perfect accord. Captain How
ell was among the first to urge that the
West and South should 'anite to restore
silver to its former place a3 money of re
demption in this country.
A third and interesting man mentioned
is Eustis of Louisiana. And an interest
ing announcement just now is that Mr.
Eustis is on the ocean on his way home
for a visit. He will land in New York
next Saturday. Although in office under
this administration, he is a silver man.
His most notable speech while he was in
the Senate was in advocacy of the free
coinage of silver, and it was regarded as
the most notable speech of that session on
that subject. It is likewise urged in sup
port ot Mr. Eustis that he is a thorough
American, and in his London speech last
year led all those members of his party
who have since insisted on a stiff assertion
of American rights and American obliga
tions. He found his voice on that subject
eight months before his chief in the White
House did.
The list is a pretty full one. Walt Hall
of Mississippi, Morgan of Alabama, Bland
of Missouri and Culberson of Texas are all
in it.
FIRM FOR SOUND MONEY,
But Ex-Governor Russell of Massa-
chusetts Is Not After the Presi
dential Nomination.
BOSTON, Mass., June 22.â When seen
to-day in regard to the report that he was
going to Chicago with ex-Secretary Whit
ney, Ex-Governor W. E. Russell said:
"At the earnest request of Mr. Whitney
and others I am going to Chicago with him
to give whatever help I can in the struggle
in the Democratic party for sound money
against free silver. My own view 3on the
subject are well known and have been
often stated. Believing the issue to be of
the gravest importance, not only to the
country, but to tbe present and future of
the Democratic party, I cannot remain
inactive if it is thought I can
be of any service at Chicago. I
cannot, however, go to Chicago under the
least suspicion that I am there for any
personal reasons, nor can I take part in
this right embarrassed by any personal in
terest in the result. I shall, therefore, de
cline to have my name presented to tne
convention as a candidate.
"I believe in making the stoutest pos
sible fight for sound money and the gold
standard and shall not give up the fight
until the votes are counted. I consider it
both a duty and a privilege to take part in
this strugzle, and I shall do it with my
whole heart, unembarrassed by any per
sonal considerations and in the earnest
hope and belief that the Democratic con
vention will be both sound in its platform
and iis candidates."

POLITICS ON THE
PACIFIC COAST.
Hon. John Willey of Seattle
Joins the Silver
Bolters.
NO MORE A REPUBLICAN.
The Evening News Deserts and
Criticizes the St. Louis
Convention.
BIMETALLISTS AT GRIDLEY.
Delegates to the National Convention
Instructed to Vote for
Teller.
SEATTLE, WAffl., June 22.â Hon. John
Willey, an able lawyer and one of the fore
most Republicans of this State, in a letter
to the chairman of the State Central Com
mittee, severed his connection with that
party to-day. He will follow the lead of
Senator Teller and associates. In part Mr.
Willey says:
"The Republican party, in its National
platform, having made a declaration of
principles at variance with my sense of
right, can no longer claim my allegiance.
I leave it in search of another upon whose
banner shall De inscribed both principles
and men.
"I suggest," the bimetallist continues,
â¢that in order to accommodate Dondhold
ers as well as to avoid a race problem, the
next Republican Convention be held in
London. When I took passage on the
ship Republicanism it was bound for Bi
metallism. You have now altered her
course and propose to land heratGold
standardville. It is a luxury for few and
yellow fever and famine for many. I re
fuse either to continue the voyage or to
land nt the place. My protest has been
over-iuled and I now claim the right to
take at least my self-respect, go overboard
and make for the nearest land."
Willey concludes: "John Sherman,
standing in the Ohio convention in 1895,
lifted his guilty hands to heaven and
called upon thp American people to rise
above party and settle this question. I
arise; good-by."
The News, an afternoon Republican
paper, edited by Colonel George G. Lyon,
an army veteran, has also bolted because
of the financial plank of the National plat
form. Ol" Vice-Presidential Candidate
Hobart it says: "He is the receiver for
three bankrupt railroad companies and of
a burst National bank, is a director of
several banks still doing business, a di
rector of several railroads not yet surren
dered to the courts and of a large number
of other corporations."
Discussing the convention, the writer
continues: "In the railroad yards at St.
Louis during the convention were twenty
eight palace cars, especially appointed,
royally equipped and stocked with extrav
agance and luxury in food and drink that
are said to have characterized the orgies of
the later Roman Emperors. Whom did
these chariots bear to the city on the Mis
sissippi ? Where were the common people ?
Whence came their representation in that
convention?"
SECOSD DISIHICI SILTERITES,
Old Parties Denounced and Teller's Can
didacy Indorsed.
GRIDLEY, Cal., June 22.â The silver
party of the Second Senatorial District
held an enthusiastic convention in Gridley
to-day, to select delegates to the National
Convention, which meets in St. Louis on
Juiy 22. R. M. Bee Dee, president of the
Gridley Bimetallic Club, was chosen presi
dent and Ridgely Tilden of Chico secre
tary. Dr. F. W. Benjamin of Oroville was
elected delegate and R, M. Beebee alter
nate.
The resolutions adopted, declare against
the evils of the goid standard; in favor of
free silver, independent of the action of
any other power; instruct the delegates to
support that peerless patriot and unflinch
ing friend of the industrial and producing
classes, Henry M. Teller of Colorado, for
President and denounce "Cleveland De
mocracy and Mark Hanna Republican
ism." 'These resolutions were introduced
by Judge Cram, a life-long Democrat.
The convention was composed of former
prominent Democrats and Republicans.
It adjourned with cheers for Teller.

MARCUS AURELIUS
HANNA AT HOME,
Continued from Krit rage.
business methods. Punctuality being one
of these methods, he went into the field a
month earlier than any of the enemy, and
when they arrived on the trround they
found that Hanna's men had the fort. In
precinct primaries and ward meetings
McKinley men were selected as delegates
to the State conventions, and these, in
turn, instructed their delegates to the Na
tional Convention to vote for William Mc-
Kinley so long as there existed a reason
able hope of his success. Mr. Hanna had
already secured control of the National
Committee, and in the contested-election
cases McKinley men were seated in prefer
ence to others, thus patching up any
weak spots there might be in the conven
tion. The enemy were taken by surprise,
and the session was more of a rout than a
battle. McKinley's forces were so much
superior in numbers that.the opposition
surrendered hands down in the presence
of a generalship so surpa=singly great.
I came over from Canion to Cleveland
last night for the purpose of sizing up
this man who bad so unmistakably proved
himself to be the foremost politician in
the United States. He came down to his
office in the Perry building late this morn
ing and a dozen people were waiting to
Bee him, some about iron, some about
coal, some about copper, some about ships
e-nd others who wanted to be appointed
Postmasters or foreign Consuls, and who
would bo willing, if tl ire were no vacan
cies in those positions, to accept situations
as gripmen or conductors on Mr. Hanna's
lines of electric cars in Cleveland. I found
Mr. Hanna to be a very jovial gentleman,
with a full round face of the Scotch or
English type. He is of medium height
ana heavily built, without any tendency
to corpulency. Hair and complexion are
sandy and eyes are gray, but the little
lamb-c',^* whiskers on his cheeks are
sbowing the frost of his fifty and two or
three more years. In facial appearance
and complexion he is the opposite of Mr.
McKinley, who has aquiline features,
with a large chin set well forward.
Mr. Hanna's nose conies outward and
upward. His upper lip is thin and con
vex ; his under lip a little fuller and closed
evenly against the upper. People who ad
mire and esteem square chins will be dis
appointed in Mr. Hanna's. It is a small
one with the point projecting forward and
upward and is made to look smaller than
it really is by the large double - chin
underneath. Mi. McKinley's complexion
is of a swarthy olive color, while Mr.
Hanna's is that of a man whose fresh pink
color has been produced by the cool sea
breezes of San Francisco. I found him
very affable, quick to grasp the complete
significance of a question and repdy to re
ply upon the instant. He walks rapidly
and has an alert air. There is an absence
from his features of anything that would
signify cure or worry. In the midst of the
one thousand and one minute and other
wise complicated details of half a dozen
different businesses he does not rave or
fret or worry. Everything is taken up in
its order and disposed of coolly and
quietly. Mr. Hanna's countenance be
tokened a man who loves the good things
of life, and lam told that his face does
not belie him. He would, no doubt, be in
his element discussing politics with a few
good friends in the Maison Riche, Tor
toni's, Marchand's, Deimorico, the Pup
and the Poodle Dog and the score of lesser
known French restaurants, all of which
are found in San Francisco, but not in St.
Louis, Cleveland or New York. The in
domitable good humor of the man keeps
his mind in a state of equipose and se
renity.
To "rattle" Mart: Hanna on any propo
sition would be equivalent to putting
the sun in cold storage. Several
times during our conversation hechuckled
with much inward satisfaction whenever
reference was made to his success as a
politician. However, as in the case of Mr.
McKinley, he declined to talK politics and
chuckled as he declined. I asked him as
to the feeling among the friends of Mr.
McKinley with relation to California's
claim for recognition at the hands of the
Republican party. "With a sly twinkle in
his eyes and just a little bit of a chuckle
he replied that when the McKinley ad
ministration should have been installed it
would be a matter for determination, but
not before. He evidently desired me to
infer from his manner that neither him
self nor McKinley had made any promises
regarding California and its claims for
recognition by the National Government.
Mr. Hanna was more communicative
when asked as to his political experience,
and he chuckled ail through the telling of
it. He began political life in 1880 when he
was one of the managers of the cam
paign in this State. In the campaigns of
l v - J. ISSS, and 1892 he had some experi
ence as a delegate to the National conven
tion and as a political manager. In 1884
and LBBB he supported John Sherman.
I asKed him. whetuer his having gone
into the field in this present campaign ear
lier than his opponents had not been a
very large factor of his success in procur
ing Major McKinley's nomination, but he
declined to admit that the earliness of the
bird had had so much to do with the
catching of the worm. He preferred to
make a better point by saying that the
large factor in the case was that the peo
ple wanted Major McKinley for the Presi
dency.
"Yes," he added, with an air of reverie,
"I went out early into the fight." Then he
chuckled once more and the double chin
trembled with glee. Finding him in such
good humor, I tried him again.
"Do you know as a matter of fact what
is the sentiment of the people, the people
â who work in the factories, who dig iron
ore and coal, the men who keep small
shops, the clerks, the doctors, the lawyers,
the laborers, the mechanics and the farm
ers on the currency question?"
â \Vithout a moment's hesitation he re
plied: "Tile people are in favor of sound
money, of a currency which means a dol
lar when it is stamped as a dollar and
whose face value does not fluctuate."
In reply to another question, Mr. Hanna
said that he was engaged in various busi
ness enterprises. He mentioned the min
ing of iron ore, the making of pic iron,
ship building, some other manufacturing
industries md running street cars. Most
of these enterprises are in and around
Cleveland. He had a few mines around
Lake Superior and coal mines in Penn
sylvania. Mr. Hanna spoke of those
"some" and those "few >: mines and val
uable properties with as much indiffer
ence as another man would tell that he
owned a few head of horses. It is not his
ownership of those important properties,
however, which is remarkable. It is
rather the fact that he can handle them at
a profit in these days of hot competition
and split nickels, and that all the cares,
the risks, the complications, the innumer
able petty details which mu-t be taken
into account have not placed a wrinkle on
his cheeks nor a frown upon his forehead.
In his case the more complications the
more chuckles.
Mr. Hanna possesses all the qualifica
tions requisite for a popular and success
ful Secretary of the Treasury. He wtnt to
Canton to-day to see Major McKinley and
to invite him to spend a few weeks yacht
ing on Lake Erie before beginning the ac
tive work of the campaicn.

He confined his remarks to the city and

SAN JOSE, Cal., June 22.â Henry Hess,
the 19-year-old son of L. hess, who con

became violently insane about 1 o'clock
this afternoon. Young Hess was in the
dyeing works at the time, and in his vio

.and placing his knee on his chest, began
to choke him. Temple was badly bruised,
the corner of the table striking his abdo
men. His chest was also injured and a
hemorrhage resulted. He is believed to be
in a serious condition.
For the past two or three weeKs young
Hess has been gradually losing his mind,
and has been under the care of a physi

from home and did not return until this
morning. His parents were about to
take him to Santa Cruz, thinking a change
would do him good.
Hess was arrested by Officers Allen and
Sin it hey and taken to the County Jail,
where he was placed in a straitjackct
and straps.

Capitalist Parker's Remark to a Friend
Concerning Hi* Will.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. June 22.â At the open
ing of the Parker will contest tnis morn
ing Marshall I'omeroy was recalled to the
stand to make a few corrections in his
testimony given last Thursday. At that
time the witness had stated that he did
not know of the existence of the will and
the codicil of the deceased until after the
testator's death. This morning Mr. Pom
eroy stated that he was then in error. He
was told by Parker of his will two days
before his death, and Parker then told the
witness that it was all right, just as he
wanted, with two exceptions, and they
were that Parker wanted the witness to
Day $1000 to Delia Sinnott of San Jose and
the same amount to Mrs. Olive Battlefield
of Hartford, Conn.
Concerning the spiritual seance in Hart
ford, when Purneroy and Parker were there
in 1893, Pomeroy said Joe Robinson, the
colored butler of Jane Pomeroy's house
hold, tried to get as a medium, but
couldn't make the spirits respond. Then
Mrs. Law undertuok it, and she held com
munications with spirits represented to be
those of Delia Parker, Georue's first wife
and a sister of the witness.
Pomeroy said Georjje H. Parker was not
a firm believer in spiritualism. He denied
all knowledge of Parker making a new
will in Chicago in 1893 ai the home of
Mrs. Hentz.
Parker was never engaged to Mrs.
rientz. He said he had no use for her.
Mrs. Hentz had got a good deal of money
from Parker and was always badgering
him for more. Parker loaned her money
to start a lodging-house in Chicago in
1893. Parker stayed there on one occasion
and paid $16 fora week's board and lodg
ing. Parker got a letter from a lady friend
of Mr 3. Hentz a short while afterward,
saying that Parker owed for his board bill.
Dr. William Simpson, a San Francisco
druegist, testified that he had known
George H. Parker for a great many years,
and bad done business with him con
tinuously. Parker always seemed a
bhrevrd business man and in full posses

Reidling says he is satisfied Miller is the

Reidling lost about $100 worth of jewelry,

SEATTLE DIVORCE CASE,
Mrs. Kinsey Returns to Tell of
Mrs. Dawson's Alleged
Escapades.
Prominent Men Involved by the Tale
of the Accus d Wife's Former
Domestic.
SEATTLE, Wash., June 22.â George
Kinsey and his pretty wife, formerly Lot
tie Evans, arrived in Seattle from Kansas
City this morning, and this afternoon Mrs.
Kinsey, on the witness stand in Judge
Hume's court, told what she said was the
truth about the wild escapades of Mrs.
Dr. Dawson, both in this State and in
California.
After making their affidavits in the di
vorce case several months ago the Kinsevs
suddenly left California, and when ex-
Mayor J. T. Ronald, counsel for Mrs. Daw
son, went to Los Angeles to see them they
could not be found.
The plaintiff also wanted them, but
could not locate them until a week ago,
when it was learned that they had re
moved to Kansas City. General Carr, who
is at the head of the militia in the State,
and who is counsel for Dr. Dawson, went
after them.
Mrs. Kinsey to-day said that while in
Mrs. Dawson's employ as a domestic she
was used as a tool by the doctor's wife,
who sought to hide her own escapades.
Mrs. Kinsey claimed that sne assisted
Mrs. Dawson in deceiving her husband,
and said it was not until after the divorce
suit had been brought that she confessed
to Dr. DÂ»wson. She looked after Mrs.
Dawson's correspondence with other men.
The witness said that in the summer of
1893 the Dawson home in this city was
entered by burglars, and Mrs. Dawson
sent for Charles Esplin, one of the co
respondents in the case, to come and stay
at the house in the absence of the doctor.
He was there for one week, and on several
occasions Mrs. Kinsey found Mrs. Dawson
in Esplin's room, which connected with
Mrs. Dawson's.
Once they visited Tacoma. They went
to Chilbergs and engaged a room. Mrs.
Dawson went out in the evening and did
not return until the next morning.
She said that she had been unable to get
into tlie room, and had gone to another
room for the nicht. The witness said
Captain Howell of Tacoma had been with
Mrs. Dawson in the early part of the even
in p.
The witness went into details concern
ing the* exciting life which Mrs. Dawson
led wliile in California, and told of many
trips and escapades in which young Ester
brook of Alameda figured very promi
nently.

STRANGE RAIL DISASTER
Freight Cars Carried Into the
Water by a Mountain
Landslide.
ONE IS OCCUPIED BY TRAMPS.
The Uninjured Attempt to Gain the
Shore but Cannot Breast the
Stream.
SPOKANE, Wash., June 22.â News of a
horrible disaster that caused the loss of
twelve lives was received here to-night
from Kootenai Falls. A treight train on
the Great Northern Railroad was derailed
by a landslide this morning and several of
the cars were carried into the river. All
sank but one.whicb haa lost its trucks and
floated on the water over the falls, to be
reft to splinters when it struck the seeth
ing whirlpool below.
ln one of the cars carried into the river
were twelve tramps, and not one escaped.
Those of the luckless tourists who were
uninjured succeeded in gaining the
top of the floating car. Persons on shore
attempted to cast ropes to them, but
failed. Several of the tramps leaped into
the water, but could not breast the swift
current, and all were carried over the falls.
None of tbe bodies have yet been recov
ered.
SAXIA HOS* KAIIfIES.
1-epuliltcans Indorse the Action of the
y ation al Convention.
SANTA ROSA. Cal., June Every
feature of old-time Republican enthusiasm
was in evidence here to-night at the Mc-
Kinley and Hobart ratification meeting.
Bonnres, red tires and rockets illumined
the skies and the loud booming of cannon
allowed no one to forget what was going
on. The Athenaeum was crowded to the
doors by eager friends of protection who
were not backward in applauding the
speakers.
Santa Rosa is a stronghold of the woman
suffragists, and hundreds of women at
tended the meeting to-night. Many of
them were heard predicting the success of
the Republican party this fall and the sub
sequent enfranchisement of their sex.
Those who addressed the meeting were
Albert G. Burnett. D. E. McKinley, L. V.
Hitchcock. R. M. Swain and Congressman
Barham. The speakers were applauded to
the echo, and the sentiments expressed
seemed to meet with the approval of the
immense throng. Three rousing cheers
ana a tiger ended the meeting.

CRAFIN VIS ALIA CONTACT.
Outlato Talinadge's Antipathy to Wear-
iiir/ Oregon Boot*.
VISALIA, Cal., June 22.â Walter Tal
madge, convicted on two charges of hog
stealing, with sentences of nine years each,
is an inmate of the County Jail, awaiting
the result of an appeal to the Supreme
Court. Talmadge has been an active ad
viser and plotter in the defense of several
criminals. He has the most utter con
tempt for the officers, and never loses an
opportunity to display it.
For several months he has worn two
Oregon boots. Â»
When Sheriff Merritt was inspecting
the cells this morning a visit was paid to
Xalmadge's. A deputy tried to unlock
one of the boots, but the key would not
turn. "When the officers reached for the
other leg Talmadge muttered something
about the boot not Dein^; there, and it was
not.
It was found in his bed, wrapped in a
handkerchief. Talmadge says he took it
off about a month ago, and since then has
been wearing a piece of rolled blanket to
represent the heavy steel boot. It is be
lieved that by continually beating them
together he broke the bolt.
GOLD iJiOM VXAJbASKA,
Two Schooner Cargoes of Concentrates
Arrive at Tacoma.
TACOMA. Wash., June 22.â A letter of
May 19 from Fred Meeker, who captains a
local party prospecting on Six Miie Creek,
Cooks Inlet, states that in shafts down ten
feet, and not to bedrock, numerous colors
and pieces of gold were found, leading to
the conclusion that on bedrock rich dirt
would be uncovered.
In starting, the miners had to dig
through nine or ten feet of snow and ice.
They were satisfied ttiat their summer's
work would be well rewarded.
Very rich dirt had been found in other
places, turning out several small chunks
of gold to the sbovelful. The best returns
are expected from the canyons near by,
which were still full of ice when Aieeker
wrote.
The Tacoma smelter to-day received
over 800 tons of gold dust and concentrates,
comprising the cargo of the schooners Sal
vator and Maggie iluss, from Unalaska,
Unga Island. The cargoes are valued at
nearly $100,000. Two months ago a cargo
was received from the Alaska Commercial
Company's mine there. This season's out
put of goid will be the largest in the
sland's history.
NEWS OF MARE ISLAND,
Nearly Four Thousand Names
Now Listed in the Employ
ment Department.
Men Seeking Work Are Wasting Time
When They Journey to the
Navy-Yard.
VALLEJO, Cal., June 22.â Although |
quite a force of men have been added to j
rolls in some of the departments at the |
navy -yard during the past ten days, there j
will be no increase in the department of i
steam engineering until after July. The
men in that department are being fur
loughed.
There are nearly 4000 names on the j
books of the labor employment depart
ment, and it is now conceeded to be more
than useless for more men to spend their j
time and money in coming to the island
to be enrolled. Their chances for work
will be slim. As near as can be learned
there will beno unusual force of men em- j
ployed. The force may number 1000 men, j
unless the ships now at the yard should be
wanted for urgent cruises.
The gunboat Bennington was taken j
into drvdock Friday. The usual painting j
of hull, overhauliug of sea-valves, etc., j
will be done. After the gunboat is out of ]
dock the Theiis will probably go in and ;
have the grass removed from its hull, j
The old Swatara was hauled in alongside j
the dock the other day to allow of the re- i
moval of a lot of constructive gear prior to j
the old hulK being disposed of at auction
under sealed bids.
Paymaster Barry is slated to relieve
Paymaster Skelding at the yard. This |
will not occur before October. It is not I
known whether pay clerks at navy-yards ,
come under civil service rules or not. If ;
so, Mr. Bollard, the clerk, will remain; if ]
not, Paymaster Barry may bring his clerk I
with him.
The commandant at the yard seems to
favor doing what he can to assist in cele
brating the Fourth of July in Vallejo in a â â 
befitting manner. Steps are being taken
to send a delegation of marines and blue- I
jackets over to town to assist in making I
the celebration a success. They will be ]
cordially received and entertained if they
come, which will require the sanction of
the Secretary of the Navy to allow.
PERJURY AT PORTLAND.
Witnesses Against Alleged Train Robbers
Found to Have Given Contradictory
Evidence.
PORTLAND, Ore., June 22.â P00l and |
Case, the outlaws convicted of the robbery i
of the Southern Pacific train on July 1 of I
last year, in Cow Creek Canyon, stand :
even more than a fair chance for eventual J
liberty, despite their confinement of nearly j
a year in Multnomah County jail.
Judge Bellinger in the United States :
District Court to-day granted the prison- ;
ers a new trial; not only that, but his j
Honor, in a searching, carefully worded :
oDinion. instructed that the evidence
given at the trial was in itself insufficient j
to convict, egregious contradictions of â 
the witnesses for the prosecution so j
weakening the testimony that the court j
could not but feel that many of the state- j
ments of the witnesses had been made in
the hope and expectation of obtaining the
reward of $3COO each, offered for the cap- i
ture and conviction of the robbers.
One point on which stress was laid by
Attorneys A. Abraham and W. W. Card
well during the trial was the testimony of
prosecuting witnesses as to the rain of
July 4. They testified that there was a
slight rain oh the night of the 4th and
that they were able to follow the foot
prints of the robbers the next day.
In contradiction of this evidence, the
Weather Bureau reports, taken under the
direction of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company, show that the rainfall was exces
sive, and would have entirely obliterated
such tracks as G. W. Quine, the chief
prosecuting witness, claimed to have fol
lowed.
Fire at Fresno.
FRESNO, Oal., June 22.â The residence
of Mrs. S. Griffith, mother of S. N. Griffith
and the late E. J. Gritfith, was burned to
the ground this evenin.'. The loss will be
about $2500, wliich is partially covered by
insurance. The (ire was caused by the ex
plosion of a lamp, which had been left ia
a strong draught. Th* house was one of
the first erected in Fresno.
Fishing lleiititned at Astoria.
ASTORIA, Or., June 22. â The first
day's fishing after the strike was re
warded by a phenomenal catch. All the
canneries are blocked, having more fish
than they can handle. It will taue a tew
days to determine whether the quantity is
the result of the river not being fished or
of an unusuaily large run. AH signs of
the trouble have passed.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 23, 1896.
MONDAY NIGHT
WITH THE PLAYS.
John Drew as Mr. Kilroy
in "The Squire of
Dames."
DAINTY MAUD ADAMS.
Blanche Bates Appears in Low
Comedy at the Columbia
Last Night.
TIVOLI'S GO TO THE MOON.
"The Gray Mare" at the California.
The Weekly Bills in Other
Theaters.
i Considering that a large portion of so
, ciety has hied itself to summer resorts,
, there was a good showing of fashionable
people at John Drew's first night at the
Baldwin Theater. The theater was fully
two-third 3 filled, and it presented that
i â¢ gala appearance which was conspicuous
j by its absence during the Goodwin en
i gagement.
The play was "The Squire of Dames,"
presented for the first time in San Fran
â¢ ci3co. It is an adaptation from the French
of Alexandre Dumas tils, by R. C. Car
ton, and in the original has a seasoning of
vice which has been largely eliminated in
the English version. As the play stands
there is nothing absolutely to shock the
i susceptibilities of an American audience.
The risque portions of the original plot
have been delicately smoothed over in the
1 adaptation, and the suggestions which, ac
cording to Dumas, would have shocked |
Mrs. Grundy, according to R. C. Carton |
are so vague and pointless as to be devoid i
| of all sting.
The "Squire of Dames" is one Mr.,Kil-
I roy, whose one object in life, apparently, I
I is to strike up sudden but abiding friend- !
ships with married ladies, who are on the
' verge of committing the indiscretion of
1 letting their hearts go out of their hus
bands' keeping.
This guardian angel watches over his
proteges by day and by night; he is always
on the spot to "play the unwelcome third
party at what would otherwise have been
I dangerous tete-a-tetes; he secures posses
sion of uncompromising letters, photo
graphs, etc., giving them back to the fair
senders, and, having finally bluffed off the |
threatening lover, he hands the wife's j
heart back to her husband, fair and spot- j
less, as on the day she took her wedding
1 | vows.
' I This charmingly philanthropic part is
! ! enacted by John Drew, whose easy non- j
s { r.iialance peculiarly fits him for the role. |
I | At first it requires a stretch of the imagin- |
> ! ation to Imagine a nineteenth century j
gentleman devoting his entire time and |
energies to the task of saving ladies from j
stooping to folly and learning too late that
I j men betray, but if any one could make j
such a part probable it is perhaps John
i Drew.
. i He seemed to succeed last night in con
i vincing his hearers that he was a probable
' character.
: Miss Maude Adams was, as usual, the life
t ; and soul of the John Drew company. As j
- 1 Mrs. Adeline Dcnnant she was merely an i
episode in Mr. Kilroy's life â one of the
[ ! many whom he had saved in the past and
was destined in the future to save from
t scorching themselves at the flame of love.
, I She had an adoring husband, from whom
' j she had been separated, and she was
r ; trifling with the affections of a baronet
i ! who was not her husband.
, j Through this sea of troubles Mr. Kilroy
| ! guided her safely back to the haven of
, j connubial bliss, aiid in doing it gave rise
, i to some pretty dialogue and situations, i
I "The Squire of Dames" is not a strong I
play, but it affords a very entertaining j
i two hours and a half to the audience, par
i | ticularly as it was acted last night. Miss
; i Maude Adams was what, in the language
\ of Dumas, would be called tne "clou" of
j the performance.
! j The support afforded the stars was
I good. Frank E. Lamb was amusing a3 the
! pedantic English lord, Harry Harwood
made an amusing professor, and Arthur
Byron was not unsatisfactory as the baro
' net, who loved in vain. Little Miss Gladys
' Wallis was very clever as the "child,"
| who lavished her youthful affections on
| the pedantic lord; Mi.ss Ethel Barrymore
I showed a murked improvement since last
I year, and Miss Annie Irish was, as usual,
fully up to the requirements of her role.
Among those present were: The pro
! scenium boxes were occupied by Mr. and
I Mrs. Ojeda and party, Mrs. Charles M.
| Shortridge. Miss Shortridge, Dr. and Mrs.
Winslow Anderson and Mrs. Singleton.
i Other society representatives attending
were Mr. and Mrs. Russell J. Wilson, Mr. |
i and Mrs. Alfred Bouvier, George E. Hall, j
! Frank Michael, John I. Sabin, Dr.
| Sullivan, Mr. ana Mrs. Frank John

At the California.
"The Gray Mare" was given at the California
! Theater last evening to quite a good house
j that laughed at the somewhat thin humor of
the piece and then fell to wondering how the
players would get over the laboring plot of
I the play.
Effie Shannon is a pretty little girl who acts
I In lively fashion and talks fast, and Kelcey
[tells a 'fib for a very poor reason, and ViznTd
| rolls his eyes over the footlights for no reason
at all, and the others do some things, however,
I very wellâ as well as "The Gray Mare" will
i permit.
"Trip to tho Moon."
At tho Tivoli was given last evening Offen
bach's "A Trip to the Moon." It is a gorgeous
scenic affair with plenty of tinsel, colored
I lights and tropical brilliancy generally. But
j it is jolly throughout, and the several new
[ songs are full of sparkle. It is founded upon
; Jnlis Verne's yarn, in wliich Ferris Hartman
j as Vlan, King of Normandy, Louise Koyce as
his son Caprice, and Y\ . H. West us Microscope,
a servant, is shot up to the moon and they
have many funny musical adventures there.
A number of pretty "light fantastic toe"
specialtins in all colon runs through the entire
piece. Miss Helen Smith, unUor the name of
Helen Merrill, made her debut as Flamraa, the
first lady of the court. She is a charming
young lady, and her first public effort as a
singer was pleasing. The Tivoli people wlli
co to the moon all this week.
At the Grttnd.
There was plenty of navy, navy heroes, blue
water and the roar of guns in "'A Perilous
Voyage" last evening at the Grand Opera
house. Kate McAllister, a pretty girl, is loved
by two gallant naval officers, the captain and
first lieutenant of the same ship. Of course
she prefers the junior officer and follows him
in the disguise of a sailor aboard the vessel.
In Chinese waters the ship is burned by pirates
and all hands captured. Kate has an oppor
tunity to become leading lady in the harem of
a prince but declines with thanks, and the
prisoners are all rescued just as they are about
to be shot because of Kate's up-to-date objec
tion to an alliance with China. The play will
run all the week.
Grover's Alcazar.
"The Cross-Roads of Life" was produced last
night at Grover's Alcazar with several star
performers in the cast. Edmund Collier
played his role ot Dick Hawthorn with all his
wonted power and verve. Miss Amy Lee, as
Dick's sister Lily, quite brought down the.
house with her songs and dances. Frank
Doane shone as Honest Ned, the song-and
dance bootblack.
The rest of the cast was good and included
May Noble, A. 11. Hailctt, Clyde Hess, Gorden
Foster and C. A. Henderson.
Columbia Theater.
The Frawley Company is pinning Its affec
tions to De Milie and Belasco with good re
sults, to judge from the almost full house
which greeted the performance of "Lord
Chumley" last night.
The play is not unknown here. Frank
Worthing took the part of Lord Chumley, the
sprig of the aristocracy, who appears to'be so
very inane till love brightens his wits jand
makes a hero of him. /
If he had beea playing in a parlor or even in
a theater of more limited dimensions than the
pretty little Columbia, his impersonation of
the part might have been written down as ex
tremely finished and clever. Worthing whs
most sympathetically inane and he never
ceased to be a finished gentleman, but owing
to his imperfect enunciation, or rather to the
throatiness of his voice, much of what he said
was lost in the wings and flies and never
reached the audience
Maclyn Arbuckle is always clever, though
he has been seen in more congenial roles than
that of Ailam Butterworth, retired. Tyrone
Power made a good villain, and Charles Wyn
gate was melodramatic enough to supply the
raw material for a dozen misguided and suffer
ing youths.
Miss Blanche Bates astonished her friends
by appearing as a grimy little slavey and she
played the part as one to the manner born.
Fhe had not been suspected of yearnings
toward low comedy, but she made one of the
hits of the performance.
Miss Hope Ross was, as usual, a charming
ingenue ai.d the other roles were well sus
tained.
"Lord Chumley" was preceded by "The Pi
lent System," a curtain-raiser, in which Fraw
ley and Maxine Elliott did some good work.
At the Orpheum.
The most noticeable of the new performers
at the Orpheum this week is Lillian Weston,
who is said to play on thirty different musical
instruments. If this is a fact, she did not
show the full extent of her powers last night,
but she exhibited enough proficiency in ma
nipulating diverse instruments to win her the
hearty applause of the house.
Her performance on the xylophone was
really remarkable. She also played the drum
excellently ;md her duet on two banjos excited
j both surprise and admiration. Miss Weston
| cleverly manipulated the bells, concertina,
j meloiiion and violin.
Billy Van's humorous monologues would
have been prolonged all night if applause
could have induced him to go on giving en
cores. Watson and Duprez gave a burlesque
j magic performance which fell rather flat, per
haps because it was all in dumb show. Bimbo
and Tehl gave some amusing horse-Dlay and
the Stewart sisters sang and danced themselves
into the good graces of the audience.
Among the holdovers are Lawrence and Har
rington, the Bowery spielers, the Meera broth
ers, and the clever Marlow-Dunham family.
DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION.

THIRTY THOUSAND DROWNED.
Appalling Loss of Life by the Tidal Wave
in Japan.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 22.âSecre
tary Olney to-day received a long dispatch
from Mr. Herod, secretary of the United
States Legation at Tokio, wifh reference to
the terrible earthquakes and tidal wavÂ« in
Northern Japan.
The report shows that the loss of life was
much larger than was first supposed. The
first reports said that a thousand persons
had been drowned. Then later reports es
timated the number of drowned at 10,000.
The dispatch of Mr. Herod states that
the latest estimates fix the number of
drowned at 30,000, but reports of loss of life
are still being received, and this number
may be increased. Whole villages along
the seashore were swept away, every in
| habitant being drowned.
Up to the time at which the telegram
was sent, June 21, news had been received
of the loss of rive Americans by tha tidal
wave.
A SACRAMENTO PHENOMENON,
Letlie Young Wheels a Mile Over a Slow
Track in 1:67 8-8.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. June 22.â Leslie
Young of the Capital City Wheelmen,
while "working out" this evening on his
training for the Fourth of July races here,
rode a mile over the racetrack in 1:57 3-5.
He is little more than a boy and has been
riding only a few months. The track is
used daily by running and trotting horses,
and is several seconds slow for wheeling.
The local wheelmen believe that Young
will be able to ride with the best of tt.e
cracks before the season ends.

A SAN MATEO
BANDIT FOILED,
Frightened Horses Prevent
the Robbing of a
Stage.
SCARED BT A RED MASK.
They Dash Madly Away With
the Coach at Sight of the
Highwayman.
BULLETS SPEED HARMLESSLY.
Five Shots Are Fired at the Driver,
but He Escapes Without
Injury.
SAN MATEO, Cal., June 22.â An un
successful attempt waj made by a single
highwayman this afternoon to hold up the
stage running between Halfmoon Bay ana
San Mateo. That it was unsuccessful is to
the credit of the horses attached to tne
vehicle. They bolted at sight of the out
law and, in a blind gallop of several milea,
pulled the stage, its Dassengers and the
treasure in the express box out of harm's
way.
The stape left Halfmoon Bay at 1 o'clock.
Driver Ed Campbell handled the reins.
It carried three passengers â a lady and a
gentleman inside and another man occu
pying a seat with the driver,
As the coach was rounding a curve at
Spring Valley Dam, five miles from San
Mateo, the highwayman sprang from the
brush lining the road. He was masked, a
red bandana handkerchief covering his
face, and he carried a rifle and revolver.
"Hold up!" he ordered. "Hold up, or
I'll shoot!"
The sudden appearance of the red
masked man before them and the strange
sound of his voice, partly mulKed by the
handkerchief, frightened the horses. They
swerved to one side of the road and broke
into gallop. At once the outlaw leveled
his rifle and fired. The bullet sped be
tween Campbell and the passenger seated
by his side.
The report of the firearm added to the
fright of the horses and they dashed away
at breakneck speed, the driver giving them
free rein and urging them on. The high
wayman fired four times in rapid succes
sion at the driver, but fortunately the ro.ll
ing of the stage as it swung in and out of
ruts and over rough places made the
human target a difficult one to hit and
CamDbell escaped unharmed. The stage
had almost reached San Mateo before the
horses could be brought down to a trot.
Sheriff McElroy, who was at Redwood
City, was notified by telephone and
at once organized a posse and started for
the' scene of the attempted hold-up.
Neither Driver Campbell nor his passen
gers could give an accurate description of
the outlaw, his face being entirely covered
by the mask he wore. The value of the
contents of the express box is not known.

PATRIOTISM, PROTECTION
and PROSPERITY.
I OK PRESIDKNT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Ohio
FOR VICK-riIK^IKKNT-
GARRETT A. HOBART, or New Jersey
KLKCTION NUVKMBKK ?., 1896.
Whitney is just frantic.
It is now time for every Democrat to
write a letter.
Grover may declare war on Spain just to
find vent for his feelings.
It is just about as well to begin calling
him President McKinley.
About the only use of the Chicago con
vention is to make more talk for a while.
In its last analysis Whitney"s letter is
simply a plea for Democracy to get on tbe
St. Louis platform.
Every Democrat is willing to talk of the
money question, but not one will say a
word about the tariff.
The election of McKinley is so well as
sured that business men are already talk
ing of new enterprises.
A few extreme silver leaders may for
sake the Republican party, but the voters
will stay with protection.
Every industry in the should or
ganize a Republican club and make a fight
for the protection it needs.
We won't turn the pictures of the silver
bolters to the wall yet. They may come
back in time to be forgiven.
There are few people who have any
hopes of the Chicago convention, but those
who have will be disappointed.
The more the people learu of Hobart 's
executive ability the more eager tbey are
to see him President of the Senate.
Now that the Duckleyites have been
forced down to bedrock they have noth
ing to lose and a light jn?t suits them.
Unless Cleveland gets his mad up and
interferes the Cuban crisis will probably
camp where it is and stay all summer.
The people know the repeal of the Mc-
Kinley tariff wrecked our industries and
that a re-enactment of it will revive them.
No man can be truly loyal to the Ameri
can home who is not also loyal to the
American workshop. The one needs the
other.
If the Democrats wish to poli their full
party vote in this State they had batter
make a Presidential ticket of Daggett and
Buckley.
It is reported from Vienna that Blanther
is bogus, but as our police did not know him
to be such they cannot be pnnished for
passing him.
The thiny: for Republicans to do now is
to push the work of organization as rap
idly aa possible. The campaign will soon
be under way.
Our alien labor legislation is aaid to be
displeasing to Canada, but all the same she
knows whenever she wishes to come in out
of the cold she can.
Teller should have looked before cc
leaped. It seems that in coming down in
the Democratic camp he landed on the
toes ol lots of people.
The Populists have no Presidential can
didate of their own this year and seem
willing to accept any old thing the other
parties will give them.
Every young voter who is to enter bis
. first political campaign this year should
join a Republican club at once and learn
how victory is organized.
The proposal to run Teller for Secretary
of the Treasury on the Democratic ticket is
one of those fresh schemes which are alto
gether too raw for digestion.
Now that his dear Standard oil friend
Whitney has come out for bimetallism
Cleveland nas no one to stand by his gold
standard save Morgan and Harrity.
In all this talk about tariff and finance,
no Congressional district in California
should lose sight of the anti-funding fight.
The people haven't won thut battle yet.
Pennsylvania Democrats will not go to
Chicago solid for Pattison. Tbe silver
men among them have got tip a diversion
for Sibley which promises to be very
diverting indeed.
There seems to be a prospect of good
prices for dried fruit this fall and moreover
a fairly good harvest despite the frosts, so
California will have money for business as
soon as D;isiness revives.
Many of the leading nations in Europe
nre ready for a return to international bi
metallism, and under the vigorous leader
ship of a Republican administration in
this country the return can be easily and
promptly effected.
LOYAL REPUBLICANS.
The statements of Senator Phoup of
Idaho and of Congressman Bowers of this
State, published in Thk Cam, yesterday,
gave a clear expression of tho altitude' of
loyal silver Republicans to the party at
tliis juncture, and aho outlined the policy
which it is best for Republican bimetal
lists to pursue in order most effectively
and most promptly to bring about the re
establishment of that system of money to
which they are devoted.
The statement* of the two leaders in re
gard to the proper policy of bimetallists,
who are also protectionists, are almost
identical with what The Call has already
advanced on the subject. Senator tShoup
said: "I am loyal at all times to the free
and unlimited coinago of the white metal
at a ratio of 10 to 1, and will always work
for the interests of my constituency, but I
believe the best plan for the people to pur
sue is to elect free silver ruen to Congress
from the old established parties, until a
work ing majority insures the passage of a
free coinage bill." Congressman Bowers
declared: "I will stick to silver and work
for it. but strictly within the lines of my
party. There is no good that can come
from bolting the Republican ticket. The
way to accomplish the hopes of free coin
age adherents is to work in the party until
a majority may be won, as the Â«nld adher
ents have won this time."
No Republican who has an intelligent
comprehension of the situation can doubt
the wisdom of the policy proposed. Noth
ing can be gained for the cause of free
coinage by leaving tbe Republican party.
As a matter of fact, the voters of the great
centers of population are thinking more
of work and wages than of any other
financial question. The issue to which
their thoughts and energies are directed is
tho establishment of a protective tariff
and a revival of industry. That is the
meaning of the popular uprising for Mc-
Kinley and the enjhusiasru with which
his nomination at St. Louis has been
everywhere ratified and commended.
Congressman iiowers gave an accurate
summary of the situation in saying: "The
American people never had a good chance
to test the difference between protection
and something else until the Wilson bill
went into effect. The change has been
so appalling in all kinds of business that
Democrats as well as Republicans are go
ing to have protection." That is the con
dition that confronts u^. Capitalists,
business men, workingmen and laborers
all feel the need of a restoration of the
American iudustrial system before we can
enter upon any monetary reforms. AYe
must first make secure and comfortable
the homes of the people. We must open
the shops, set the wheels turning and give
every man a chance to earn a living. The
people demand that much and the de
mand is just. All loyal protectionists,
therefore, must stay with the party in this
fightâ we can settle the silver question
later on.
THE DISGRUNTLED.
When a Republican begins to predict de
feat for McKinley and Hobart in Califor
nia because the St. Louis platform does
not declare unqualifiedly for this or that
policy, he will be found, upon scratching
hi 3 back, to be merely disgruntled over
failure to get exactly what ha very much
wanted. When a man advertises that de
feat is staring his party in ihe face, ac
cording to his best judgment, a very loose
and hasty analysis of his character would
be quite enough to base the opinion upon
that he is a partisan to the extent of his
opportunity to use the party to iurther his
own aims.
Ingratitude is said to be an expression of
the lowest and most degraded attribute of
the human heart. It matters not whether
it finds play in social, business or political
life, it is none the less to be condemned,
denounced and hated. But there is a
spirit of manliness in nearly every one
that is quick to detect under the law of
attraction and repulsion tbe inner and
secret purpose of such an individual.
It is an insult to the intelligence of Cali
fornians of all creeds and parties to say
that any of them are so weak and uncer
tain of purpose as to be moved to open or
secret rebellion against their party simply
because they are not altogether pleased
with tbe policy the party will pursue in
the solution of certain economic problems.
When it comes to a matter of honest con
victions a manly man would boldly say
why he could no longer co-operate with
his old party. It is the dishonest man
who retains his connection with his party
to sow seeds of doubt, fault-finding and
apathy.
In truth, the rank and file of the Repub
lican party of California were never more
enthusiastic, never more determined, never
better satisfied with their National candi
dates than now. One need but read the
account of the outpouring of the people in
every town and city of the State on last
Saturday night to ratify the nominations
of McKinley and Hobart to know where
the Republican party stands. Shouts of
joy and satisfaction were heard through
out the length and breadth of the com
monwealth over the work of the St, Louis
convention. Patriotism, protection and
prosperity is the battle-cry.

JAPAN'S PURPOSE.
In a very practical and substantial way,
without ostentation, Japan is forging
ahead in the direction of all kinds of man
ufacturing industries, and already her busi
ness men have shown great aptness in
carrying forward commercial and other
business enterprises on a large scale. This
is bound to place the empire in time in
the attitude of a strong competitor in all
the markets of the world. It may not be
generally known, but is nevertLeless true,
that next to the United States, Germany
and Russia, Japan comes with tbe largest
home population of what some one calls
"the up to date nations." And it is also
true of Japan that her middle or working
class are an ingenious, industrious and
frugal people who take great delight in
turning out better factory products than
some of their Christian competitors can,
or rather do.
The greatest progress Japan has made
in the industries will be found in cotton
fabrics, although woolen goods and fin
ished iron and leather products are in
creasing in volume right along. In 1388
the Japanese yarn mills turned out 8,000,
--000 pounds and 147,000.000 pounds last
year. During the period between the be
ginning of ISSB and the end of IS9s there
was a shrinkage in yarn imports of 43,500,
--000 pounds, or from C 0.000.000 pounds to
19,500,000 pounds.
Japan's cotton-mill fabric output shows
a still greater increase, fn the three years
ended December 31, 1895, the import of
raw cotton for home manufacture in
creased from 106.500,000 pounds to 182,
--500,000 pounds. Most of this raw material
was drawn from India and China. In
fact, practically all of it was drawn from
those countries, for the mills confined
their product to such coarse fabrics as are
used in Asia, but meanwhile the Japanese
mill-owners drew some cotton from
America for experiment. They believed
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 23, 189 G.
that they could make as pood and as fine
cotton cloth as England or the "United
.States, and how well they are succeeding
is told in their own statements, which
show that 10 per cent of the entire raw
cotton imported last year was grown in
the cotton fields of this country. In this
connection it may be said that Japan is
now turning out as fine and as good cotton
yarns and fabrics aa will be seen in Eng
lish or American mills.
But this is not all. Japan is spreading
out into the widest lielu of Industryâ from
building the largest of ships to tbe
smallest of pinsâ not wholly, but only in
small part for home consumption. The
purpose is to compete every whereâ in the
goods and wares market of San Francisco
with our home industrial products. And
can Japan do this successfully? That de
pends upon ourselves. The cost of land
ing American raw material in Japan is
comparatively light. Japan's schedule of
wages ranges from 3.3 per cent to 75 per
cent below wages paid in this country,
and the difference between what an
American and a Japanese workman spends
for Jiving purposes is equally great. This
answers the question, "Can Japanese
manufacturers compete with us in our
martets?" The necessity, therefore, for
every workingman to be active, vigilant
and determined in the good work of pro
tecting American homes should be ap
parent. It is to do this â to protect Ameri
can homes â that the Republican party is
in existence^
WHITNEY'S PLEA.
William C. Whitney's plea for the salva
tion of the Democratic party is a confes
sion as well as an argument. Ha says a
crisis like as in ISGO is upon the party and
he predicts that it will be crushed next
November as it was thirty-six years ago.
The party is united, he says, upon every
question of National policy except the one
of free silver coinage, which is true, but
that is quite enough to prevent harmonious
and undivided action upon the other prin
ciples of government. The fact is, the
party has outlived its usefulness. It has
failed to keep abreast of the times. It
still plows with a "bull-tongue" and
thrashes with a flail. It refuses to learn
by experience or observation. The earth
is flat, the pun moves and the Democratic
party wears its coat "all buttoned up be
fore," as Old Father Grimes wore his.
But while admitting the deplorable con
dition of his party and foreseeing almost
certain humiliating defeat in November,
to be followed by disintegration, Mr.
Whitney does not altogether lose hope,
lie is not heels over head in the mad
waves of despair, though be is nearly des
perate and discouraged enough to sink
and let the waters cover forever his ambi
tion to be President of the United States.
He advises the Chicago convention to for
mulate a Joseph's coat kind of a platform
â a mixture of declarations of principles
to blend so perfectly in harmony, or
rather would appear so at a distance, that
the very elect would be willing to swear
that it was the work of the reincarnated
minds of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew
Jackson. In other words, Mr. Whitney
would have the Chicago platform so
adroitly straddle the silver question that
tbe goldites would order a banquet served
to celebrate their victory and the silverites
would sing hymns of praise to theCiverof
every good and perfect gift for giving the
enemy over into their handsâ a platform
fashioned after an old game of chance,
"Now you see it and now you don't."
Mr. Whitney recited the fact, which
everybody but Teller, Boies and Bland has
known for a long time, that the countries
of the United States, Germany, France,
Italy, Austria, Holland and Belgium are
ready to hold an international congress to
devise ways and means to reinstate silver
in the monetary system of the world of
commerce and trade and security invest
ment, and that Great Britain is rapidly
drifting toward the same purpose, and
that in the near future a congress of the
nations will be held and bimetallism ac
cepted as the basis of redemption money.
But Mr. vVhitney merely elaborated the
meaning of the St. Louis platform. The
Republican party is solemnly pledged to
use the mighty influence of the United
States to hasten the calling of the nations
of the commercial world in conference to
prepare a stable and lasting monetary sys
tem that shall be the same everywhere,
meantime to not disturb the existing sys
tem. The Republican party is a 9 much of
a bimetallic party as it Is a protection
party, but it will take a little time to dis
entangle the snaris into which the Demo
cratic party's incapacity has placed the
country.
The purpose of Mr. Whitney is to first
blind the rank and file of his party by the
glare of highly burnished subterfuge, eva
sion and hypocrisy, and then inveigle
them into his gold trap, for his wing of
the Democratic party is for the gold
standard now and forsver; The leaders of
tbe wing are, for the most part, those who
toil not, neither do they spin. They live
upon investments, and the greatest labor
they perform is clipping coupons from
their bonds. Such individuals look upon
silver as plebeian money, but they can
not fool anybody with their tain: about
bimetallism. As we have said, the St.
Louis platform contemplates a bimetallic
currency at the earliest possible moment,
but meanwhile it thinks it best not to fly
from ills we have to others we know noth
ing about. The "Dollar of our Daddies"
will be in evidence and tbe Republican
party will issue the mandate that shall
make it as good a dollar of redemption as
any other kind of a dollar.
THE BUSINESS SITUATION.
The business situation here in San Fran
cisco grows stronger and more encourag
ing. As compared with la3t year the vol
ume of inland merchandise distribution
is larger and includes all hues of season
able article.*. Country merchants are buy
ing full lines, whereas Jast year, and for
three years in fact, their purchases were
larpelv confined to replenishing old stocks.
There is also satisfactory improvement in
country collections, and, generally speak
ing, there is a better leeling and a larger
degree of confidence in the present and fu
ture of business than has been observed for
three years.
The ocean trade, foreign and coastwise,
is about 20 per cent greater than at this
time last year, and the opinion in com
mercial circles is that there will be sub
stantial improvement right along. There
are a good many engagements being made
of ships to take away the new wheat crop,
but rates are a trifle higher, which is not
pleasing. China continues to take silver in
fairly large quantities. The trouble
among the Columbia River fishermen and
packers is causing considerable shrinkage
in the salmon trade, and no little loss will
be sustained thereby. Offerings of com
mercial paper for discount are not heavy,
and it may be said that prime lonns and
discounts are wanted by the banks.
Congressman Bowers was right in say
ing: "There is no good can come from
bolting the Republican ticket. The way
to accomplish the hopes of free-coinage
adherents is to work in the party until a
majority may be won, as the gold ad
herents have won this time."

The Hpiril hearkeus to grim despair;

In the distant lane where the city's blnre
Is lost like a phuntom of vanished'night;

COST OF A CONVENTION.
Chica-'O News
Some (surprising calculations have been
made as to the cost of the big convention just
closed in St. Louis. One hundred and fifty
thousand dollars was contributed by the Citi
zens' League. The cost of the hall alone was
$75,000, and although it will last for yearn it
is chargeable to the convention of 189 G.
Other bills are the expenses of the sergeant-at
arins of the convention, various printing ac
counts, cleaning the hall each night, its light
ing, lees for police and hre protection, big
postage bills and a thousand other things.
The expenses of the sergeant-at-arms were
large. He had been in St. Louis some time
and had busy day and night an army of type
writers who occupied an entire suite of rooms
at a hotel. But the money expended by the
Citizens' League is a mere "bagatelle to what
was spent by the delegates aud visitors.
There were over 1000 delegates and alter
nates, who, with their followers and friends,
made a total of some '2000 directly interested.
With the reporters, messengers, etc., the entire
number reached at least 8000. 1 1 is estimated
each of these men spent $100 in addition to
his railroad fare, aud if so the total of money
in circulation in St. Louis by the visitors was
$300,000. Add to this the expenses of the
telegraph companies and big press associa
tions aud around sum of $500,000 will be the
result.
This is a large sum, but is not the limit. Be
sides the 3000 men there were 100,000 visi
tors, who probably spent $250,000 ior railroad
fare, and how much more they spent aiter
they reached their destination depended, of
course, upon their Individual pocket-books.
Three dollars a day may be considered a small
amount for each, and something over $3,000,
--000 is the result of adding this to the previous
sum. Then there is the cos. of brass bands, of
sending the news to the papers, tbe cost of
thousands of private telegrams and innumer
able other things, which will bring the total
up to $4,000,000. This $4,000,000 would
build four battleships.
If the $4,000,000 were to be paid out in dol
lar bills and the bills made into a carpet the
carpet would be 1000 leet long, 650 feet wide
and cover 15 acres, and the Capitol at Wash
ington, if set down in the middle of it, would
appear as a toyhouse in the centerof a big rug.
Four million dollars in gold piled in a Dyramid
4 feet at the base wouid be 5 leet high. In
silver dollar.-, with a base 10 teet square, the
pyramid would be 15 feet high.
The cigars smoked by the 100,000 who went
to St. Louis, allowing five cigars a day a piece,
would be 3,500.000 and would make a pile of
70,000 boxes ot ;"ioeaeh and this pile would be
2) .; miles high. Placed end to end the 3,500
--000 cigars would reach 243 miles. At a three
for-a-quarter price they would cost $291,U6G.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
POPULISTS WARNED.
Machiavellian Workâ Deception in Regard
to Teller.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
Every intelligent aud ardent Populist who has
only read the Associated Press news dispatch
purporting to give the address of National
Chairman Taubeneck and other leading Pop
ulists of the country in favor of making Sen
ator Teller the Presidential candidate of the
People's party is certainly in a maze of doubt,
tinged with indignation; for the whole force
of the address Implies that they have gone
daft on the single silver issue, and he sees that
whatever influence the address will have as
thus reported will tend to divide and dis
hearten true and loyal Populists. Butlo! what
a change steals over his heart and illu
mines his mind as he reads that address In
full as sent over the wires by the United Press
News Agency and published in tne columns of
The Call this (.Sunday) morning! Permit me
to say that The Ca.ll has done the Populists of
this whole coast a service which they will
highly apureciute when they fully understand
the value and character oÂ£ that service simply
as regards this one dispatch, headed "Teller to
Lead the Populists," and I ask uuusual space
ior this letter that I may expose the treachery
and dishonor of this Associated Press service.
Indeed It is a matter of serious importance to
all honorable men, be they Republicans, Dem
ocrats or Populists, to have the true but skill
fully concealed purpose of tnis conscienceless
news agency fully disclosed, thereby to some
extent neutralizing its baleful influence.
On comparing closely the address as pub
lished this morning in the Examiner and
Chronicle.who.se news service is that of the
Associated Press, with that published in The
Call, as wired by Cnited Press News Agency,
I find it a glaring and dastardly case of "sup
pressioveri," in which the half-truth, told
with Machiavellian cunning and duplicity, sur
passed downright falsehood in the effect it
was intenied to produce, and has indeed pro
duced where this garbled dispatch alone has
been read. In order to render the exposure
complete, a word of explanation is needed for
readers who do not understand the attitude of
earnest Populists toward "fusion" of any kind
on the silver issue or any other issue.
Until recently National Chairman Taubeneck
has been under grave suspicion of a desire to
surrender the Populist party to the silverltes
by an abandonment of all other Populist issues
ior the sole issue of free silver coinage, but he
has just set himself right with most Populists
by tne publication of a irank and manly letter
in which he unequivocally denies the charge
and outlines a course of action in full accord
with the views of the People's party; and now
comes this dispatch through the news service
of the Associated Press and places him and
other prominent Populists in a worse light
than ever, indicating that they have rushed
headlong after Senator Teller as a single silver
plank candidate for the Presidency. No acts
of theirs could De more offensive to all loyal
and true Populists than this would be
if they were guilty of it. But they
are not; they are loyal, true, manly,
open-hearted and grandly patriotic in the ad
dress as published in The Call, but they are
made to appear in quite another light in the
dispatch published in the Examiner and
Chronicle by the omission of the paragraphs
which define the attitude of Senator Teller
toward the Populist party, the one vital thing
for Populists to know, but which was so
adroitly and completely suppressed by the
trained and talented deceivers in the service
of the Associated Press, the most malign
agency controlled by the gold men for delud
ing and confusing a trusting people to secure
their votes, bo that they themselves shall
give the gold oligarchy a new lease of power.
The reader is now prepared to understand
In a measure the treachery and dishonor of
this malignant news agency in omitting this
paragraph:
A coincident of fear, of hope, of conviction, al
ready exi-iH aiuonp intelligent and Observant
people. Political division alone creates an obstacle
to unity of purpose and harmony of action be
tween them. Ihe duty of every patriot is to re
move this obstacle, so far as it can be, by honor
able concessions and reasonable sacrifices. These
do not i-ojii. nip.iiif even the thought of merging
our party into any other or the sligntest; Impair
ment of its efficiency: but, alone, for the sake of
, humanity and to avert, if posalblu, the disasters
which the supremacy of the money power now
so menacingly forebodes, to secure the union of
good citizens who think alike upon the important
issues of financial reform, in behalf or the election
of a I'rrÃMi-nt who In spirit is antagonistic to none
of the fundamental principles of our party and
has openly engaged in the most sturdy advocacy
of our chiefeat measures.
Mark well the purport of these last words:
"A President who in spirit is antagonistic to
none of the fundamental principles of our
party and has openly engaged in the most
sturdy advocacy of our chiefest measures."
How eagerly every Populist in the land will
grasp at that assurance! How cunning the
hand that struck it out of the addressl I will
inclose in brackets [ ] the portion omitted
from the following paragraph:
We see In the private and official life of Henry
M. Teller a beacon, brightly burning, warning the
people oft the threatening shores of dissension.
He has but now publicly abandoned tne Repub
lican party, with which he has been associated
since its first organization [entering it when led by
conscience to strive for the overthrow of human
bondage and leaving it when Lincoln's teachings
were swallowed up in the greed and cruelty of the
money kings. J-'or twenty years he has been a
commanding figure in the Nation's life, a Cabinet
oflicer and Senator of the United States. Nomi
nally a Republican, be has many times openly de
tied his party when its members sought to make it
an instrument of injustice and oppression].
It required little political sagacity to discern
the reason for the omission of the bracketed
portion of the foregoing paragraph. But here
follows another paragraph which was sup
pressed because of its extreme acceptability
and vital interest to Populists, and, f would
fain hope, to a large majority of both .Republi
cans and Democrats, as the only safe and
patriotic view to be taken of the money ques
tion, which reads as follows:
For twenty years he has stood as a bulwark
aeainst the tyrannical encroachments of the Na
tional banks; he has never hesitated to declare
that tlÂ«-y should be deprived of all authority to
issue money aud to contrpl its volume; he is an
unfllncning advocate of the duty of the Govern
ment to maintain ana exercise exclusively for the
people the sovereign power of emitting all moneyâ
toM. silver and paper. He holds that to issue
bonds in time of peace is a stupendous wrong to
the people and the country.
Populists are now able to see what they may
expect from tne news service ot the Associated
Press, while on the other hand the news ser
vice of Thk Call, that ot the United Press, has
given tho address without mutilation, and The
Call has published it in full, although it sup
ports McKinley and the platform on which he
stands, and as in duty bound also whacks
away in good style at the Populists. This is
certainty broad-gauge journalism such as is
rarely seen in any part of the world. In a
word, The Call speaks for all and with a large
and true American tolerance worth of all com
mendation. Joseph Asbury Johnson.

the Scow (Svengali) was Caught by the Tide and Carried Almost Bow On Against the Heavily
Laden Barge.
as her upper works were damaged and it I
was some time before she got away from -
her uncomfortable quarters.
Trilby is a stern-wbeel steamer that is
well known on the bay. For some time
she ran opposition to the Southern Pacific
on the SacrÂ»>.mento River, but finally she
had to be withdrawn lor lack of patron
age.
Svengali is the bie barge that for weeks
has been used as "a receiving-ship" in
Mission Bay. Sometimes she is loaded
with lumber and a few days later coal
crowds her ample decks. The Trilby
wanted some of the coal and was trying to j
get alongside when the tide caught her j
and took command. The men on the
Svengali did everything in their power to
prevent a disaster, but failed. In spite
of the trouble Sveneaii and Trilby are
still good friends, and when the latter '
wants a supply of coal again she will prob
ably go out to Mission Bay.
All the petty thieves in the city seem to |
have congregated on the water front.
Hardly a night passes but what some saloon
is broken',into and other establishments are
robbed in broad dayli hi. Sunday night j
last the saloon and restaurant of W. F.
Fitzgerald, at the foot of Powell street, :
was broken into ana wrecked. Nearly [
three dozen bottles of wines and liquors j
were taken and the bar drawer ritted. The |
nickel-in-the-slot machine was torn from !
the wail and carted away. The key was j
in the money-drawer in the restaurant but i
the thieves did not wait to use it but \
wrenched the thing open, and after secur
ing the few dollars it contained, left it â 
lying on the floor. Fitzgerald blames j
some of the North Beac'i gang because it j
is plainly evident that whoever burglar- !
ized the place knows the ground well.
Sergeant Bunner and Officer Ferguson are
at work on the case.
The California Navigation and Improve
ment Company's steamer Mary Garrett
got on the mud banks last Sunday niant
while on her way to Stockton and is still
stuck hard and fast. There were over 100
passengers aboard, and they were landed
at Antioch and sent on by rail at the com
pany'^ expense. All went well after leav
ing San Francisco until Stake Point, just
this side of Black Diamond, was reached.
Then a mud bank was struck, and al
though the engines were put full speed
astern the vessel would not budge. An
hour or so later the steamer A. C. Freese
came along and attempted to tow the Gar
rett i ff, but failed. Then the passengers
were transferred to the Freese and taken
to Antioch, where they caught the early
morning train.
The California Navigation and Improve
ment Company has made an important
change in its time-tarJe. On and after
July 1 steamers will leave San Francisco
and Stockton at 6 p. m., instead of 5 p. m.,
as lormerly. This will give visitors to
both cities an hour longer each day in
which to transact their business.
There will be gay doings at Benicia next
Sunday. Captain S. Randall, tiie well
known and popular master of the Monti
celio, is to be married at noon to Miss H.
Durner of Benicia, and a special excursion
party is to be taken up on the steamer
early in the morning. Captain Clem Ran
dall of the Vigilant, will be best man, and
Captain Hatch, owner of the Monticello,
will be master of ceremonies; so the wed
ding will have more than a flavor of salt
water. The steamer that will carry the
guests and excursionists will leave Mission
street wharf at 10 a. m. next Sunday.
The sloop Sunol, wben making a tack to
pass Goat Island on Sunday, missed stays
and went ashore. The schooner Annie E.
came alone and took ti.e men off, but
could not move the sloop. Wurd was sent
to the lighthouse station, and the steam
launch was sent to the rescue. After some
hard pulling the Sunol was got off and
tovred to a safe anchorage.
The first of the overdue sugar fleet got
in yesterday in the shape of the bark
Mohican, Captain Saunders. She was
twenty-eight days coming from Honolulu
and encountered no'hing but head winds
and calms. The bark h-is been outside for
the lust ten days and during seven of
them she only covered twenty miles. The
crew was down to short rations and every
body was disgusted with the voyage.
Durine the entire run not a sail was
sighted.
The Victorian sealing schooner Ocean
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 23, 1896.
Bell was caught in the same storm that
wrecked the Katherine. A private letter
by the Rio de Janeiro says that her fore
mast went by the board and her upper
works were badly damagpd. She had 565
skins aboard, which were safely landed at
Hakodate.
San Francisco will have the pleasure of
entertaining the crew of another British
man-of-war in a few days. As soon as the
Comus reaches Victoria, B. C. , the flag
ship Impeneuse will start on a cruise
south, making her first stop at this port.
She is a sister ship to the Warspite, but
her armament is much heavier. The lm
perieuse relieved the Royal Arthur and
Admiral St. L. B. Palliser flies his pen
nant at her mizzen.
Another American ship, the J. B.
Thomas, has got a bad name. During the
run to Honolula the officers and men were
constantly fignting and when the vessel
came *o an anrhor five of the saiiors
escaped. They jumped overboard during
the nignt, butone of them, John Schmidt,
a native of Germany, aged 30 years, never
reached shore. His body was recovered
and as it was covered with bruises murder
was suspected. The four men who swam
ashore were captured and returned to the
ship. The Hawaiian authorities were
still investigating the case when the Rio
de Janeiro left Honolulu. Schmidt was a
member of tne Salvation Army and had
been the butt of every man on board the
Thomas during the voyage.
A fishing-boat was picked up by one of
the life-saving stations yesterday. It is
probably one of those from which the
steamer" City of Para and schooner Phelps
rescued the crews. The boat can be got
by applying to Major Blakeney at the head
quarters of the life-saving service in the
Appraiser's building.

GRAND JURY SESSIONS,
Renewed Efforts to Obtain Re
duction of Local Tax
atioD.
Park and School Estimates to Be
Reviewedâ Water Rates for
Ships.
"When the Grand Jury adjourned last
Friday it was thought no more evening
sessions would be held until the streets
were again lighted. Members objected to
going home in the darkness at a late hour
iof the night. Yesterday Frank Maskey,
I the foreman of the jury, who has been
away from the City for two week*, returned
' to town and held a conference with Tlieo
j dore F. Payne, the acting foreman. It is
highly probable that extra se-sions will be
! called to consider the impending tax levy,
j and to complete the measures taken to
1 provide for the accommodation of insane
I persons temporarily detained at the City
j Hall.
Members of the Grand Jury assert that
I th ey are anxious to exercise all the power
! with which they are vested to bring about
a reduction of taxes. They reenrd this
su bject as one of very great importance to
every taxpayer of the City. They compre
hend that heads of departments in the
municipal government cannot be in
dicted for recommending the appro
priation of vast sums of money, and they
do not see any way to restrain the Super
visors from authorizing extravagant sums,
other than to strenuou-ly advise against
such a course and onlist as many taxpay
ers as possible in a concerted effort against
municipal extravagance. The work al
ready accomplished in securing from the
Superintendent of Streets a revised esti
mate containing only the actual necessi
ties of that, department encourages the
Grand Jury to believe that the School Di
rectors can be persuaded to modify the
demands for school buildings.
The expert of the Grand Jury is care
fully going over the items of money dis
bursed during the present fiscal" year
under the direction ol the Park Commis
sioners. Fur loamintr tlie 'prospective for
est of the park the Commissioners have
expended $50,000 this year and they figure
that $<jO,OOO will be required for the same
purpo.se during the fiscal year of 189f!-97.
The Grand Jury has been informed by
Hermann Schussier, chief engineer of the
Spring Valley Wa.er Works, that the cor
poration will establish facilities at Mis
sion-street wharf for supplying ships with
fr sh water. After maintaining the re- I
quired apparatus for two or three months
the company will be able to ascertain the
cost of the service and upon the basis of
the ascertained cost will fix the permanent
rate for shipping.
Large Gooseberries.
Secretary Mlcher oi the State Board of Trade
yesterday received an exhibit, to be added to
the general collection at 16 Post street, that
would astonish those not familiar with the

JIM AND ANDY?
Boss O'Brien and the Clunies
Reported From Rainey's
Camp.
CURSED BYBUCKLEYITES
Story of a Deal to Make O'Brien
Sheriff and Tom Clunie
Congressman.
JOSEPH P. KELLY IS WORRIED.
The Junta Jumps Into the Ratification
Businessâ The Buck eyites' Bg
Meeting.
James H. O'Brien is no longer "coad
jutor," no longer "boss" of the Buck
leyites.
Suspicion which fed on tips suddenly
waxed into distrust of Jim at Sacramento,
and now he is damned by the old guard.
They thought at Sacramento that Mr.
O'Brien was displaying a highly unbe
coming complaisance to Gavin McNab
and that he was too much of a jolly good
fellow and too confidential with some of
the enemy.
Now it is charged that he is a deserter.
They say that he has gone into the
Raiiiey camp, and that Rainey, Daggett
ana Lanican have pulled him over by
promising to niak" him Sheriff.
"Sheriff !" say the Buckleyites, as they
pat their knives.
Mr. O'Brien, being in Santa Cruz, can
not defend himself, hut the late pet of the
Buckleyites is no longer the sweetest thing
on earth to them.
And there's Andy Clunie, too, in trouble
SKW TO-DAY
"A bargain's
a bargain" â ordinary rule of business.
If we said "A bargain 's a bargain when
you buy Schillings Best tea", perhaps
25 out of 100 would buy it. That isn't
enough. We can't make so much money
on a pound of pure fresh-roasted tea as
on a pound of colored tea ; and we have
got to sell more pounds.
So we give money back to the few
who may not like it, for the sake of selling
Schilling s Best to the many who will.
Perhaps you think that ioo out of ioo
will try it. You are wrong ; they will not.
Some people don't seem to care whether
tea is colored or not, so long as they pay
just so much a pound for it â they look at
their money rather than at what they get
for their money.
Others â the larger class â take what is
handed out to them, and never ask any
questions â they look at neither the tea
nor the money.
Everybody â both classes â should look
at both the tea and their money.
i This is one reason why we say, "your
money back if you don't like Schilling's
Best. 11
San Francisco aos A. Schilling & Cofltpatiy
along with Jim. There is more than a
suspicion that A. J. has given them the
double-cross, and curses are hissed at him.
For some little time before the convention
the Buckleyites hoped that somebody
would Bteal Clunie away from them, and
now it is charged that Clunie has gone
into the Rainey camp, too.
It may be a devilish lie, of course, but
the story is that Rainey, Daggett and
Lanigan have taken up Andrew's brother,
Thomas J. CJunie, as their candidate for
Congress, and that Andy has switched
with that deal. Joseph P. Keily is much
excited about this news, but says he can
beat Clunie for the nomination yet. As
there will be new candidates in the field
before the Congressional convention in
the Fifth District, July 20, all this is per
haps more interesting than important.
Is one others of the Buckleyites are yet
known to have deserted to Rainey's camp,
but the Rainey-Daggett-Lanigan combina
tion, 'which now has the Junta in its
power, is losing no tricks in strengthening
its forces.
The joint meeting of the Buckley gen
eral committee and State convention dele
gation at B'naiÃ'rith Hall to-night, which
will express the vigorous life remaining in
the faction and its determination to stand
by its well-founded claims to be the regu
lar pi rty machine, wiil be enlivened by
opinions of the Sacramento credentials
commhue, by Peter F. Dunne and Joseph
Rothschild, and by more or less fiery
and eloquent speeches by Colonel O'Byrne,
Reel B. Terry and other Democratic ora
tors.
Dr. James I. Stanton, chairman of the
late convention delegation, will make a
report on the said convention, and when
the meeting is through with reminiscences
of Sacramento a primary election for dele
gates to a municipal convention will be
ordered. The dates for the primary and
for the convention, which will not be
billed for earlier than September, will be
referred to the executive committee, with
power to act.
The Junta has got ahead of the Buck
leyites by announcing first that they will
conduct a huge and grand ratification of
the work of the Chicago convention.
Chairman Sullivan is now busy with plans
for the ratification which the Junta pro
poses to take charge of.
What the Buckleyites will do about a
ratification under the Junta auspices re
mains a problem. They say that they will
be in on any ratification as the regular
Democratic party, and that they will show
by their numbers where the party strength
lies.
Dr. W. J. Gavigan has just abandoned
the active practice of medicine and has re
turned to his profession of law. As a law
yer he can figure more freely in politics,
and he will likely cut a prominent figure
in the municipal politics of the next few
months.
FOR NEW LABOR LAWS,
The Next Leginlature Will Be Asked
to Consider These Matters.
After Labor Commissioner E. L. Fitz
gerald had been in ofhee a few months he
discovered that there were many laws on
the statute-books relative to labor that
were either dead letcers or so faulty in
construction as to be inoperative. In con
sequence the laboring man is subjected to
gross injustice for which he has no redress.
With the assistance of Chief Deputy Dam
the Commissioner has prepared a number
of bills and amendments, which he wiil
have presented to the next Legislature.
One is to regulate and establish the
hours a man shall be required to work. In
other words, his aim is to establish an
eight-hour State law; another is a bill
providing for the payment of men em
ployed upon public works.
ifnder the present law the mechanic
has no lien upon the product of his labor,
and hundreds of laboring men are swin
dled by unscrupulous contractors. The
abolition of tiie time-check curse he would
effect by law, so that employers would be
compelled to ray their men upon the lat
ter being discharged. Among other bene
ficial measures he will endeavor to secure
the passage of laws providing for inspec
j tors of steam boilers for the protection
|of life, inspectors of bakeries and the
regulation of the sanitary condition of all
bakeshops, a remodeling of the law com
pelling employers to provide seats for
their female employes, etc.
Copies of the proposed laws and changes
will be sent by the Commissioner to all
the central labor bodies of "'the State for
the approval of their affiliated unions and
suggestions, if there are any to be made.
The document, with the signatures at
tached, will be in the nature of a petition
on the part of the laboring element for
the enactment of the laws suggested.

JUDGE CONLAN
YELLS FOR A GUN,
Most Sensational Incident
in the Police
Court.
A MINER FROM ARIZONA
J. H Berry Puts His Hand in
His Hip Pocket as if
to Shoot.
SEIZED AND SENT TO PKISON.
On Explaining That He Merely Wanted
to Show the Judge Pap3rs
He Is Released.
A Judge yelling for a gun and a man
with his hand in his hip pocket and strug
gling in tl;e .grasp of about a dozen men
was one of the incidents in the Police
Court yesterday.
The preliminary examination of Abra
ham Green of the firm of Carrau & Green,
jewelers, 220 Sutter street, on the charge
of felony embezzlement was continued
before Judge Conlan yesterday afternoon.
J. H. Berry, the miner, who was the com
j plaining witness, was asked on Saturday
to produce other alleged rough diamonds
similar to the one valued at $5000 which
he charged Green wit., embezzling. He
again refused to produce them and this
closed the case for the prosecution.
The defendant, Green, then took the
stand and swore that the alleged rough
diamond was nothing but a crystal and
was not worth a cent. He had cut it with
a file and told Berry that it was merely a
crystal, but Berry told him to get it cut.
anyhow, as it might make a nice-appear
ing atone. The stone had been lost by W.
H. Forestier, a boy in the store. Forestier
| and another witness corroborated the de
fendant.
The Judge said he would dismiss the
I case as there was no evidence to show that
I the stone was anything but a crystal. He
! thought "Berry had been born with
: wheels in his head, and they had been
| with him till now."
"On Saturday,' 7 continued the Judge,
addr ssing Herry, "you said that if you
! did not get a square deal in this court you
would take the case to another court. I
would advise you to take the matter be
| fore the Grand Jury, and I wiil be present
so that the jurors can hear both sides of
the case, ana it is my oninion that instead
!of bringing in an indictment against
! Green for embezzlement they will bring
â¢ in one against you for insanity."
Berry had been standing beside Prose
cuting Attorney Mogan and Detective Ed
Gibson listening intently to the Judge's
remarks. Just as the Judge concluded
Berry suddenly placed his right hand in
j his hip pocKet. The Judge jumped to his
I feet and yelled "Some one give me a
i gun."
Billy Brennan, a friend of the Judge,
had been watching Berry, and in an in
j stant he sprang upon him and seized his
right hand before he could draw it out of
his pocket, and Detective Gibson grabbed
him round the waist, while several others
piled upon him.
There was for a minute or two a wild
j scene in the court. Those in the range of
fire ducked their heads and some crawled
underneath the seats.
Berry tried to explain, but his voice was
drowned id the din. The Judge ordered
Bailiff Kelly to take Berry to the City
Prison and search him for a weapon. He
was taken there and the only thing found
in his hip pocket was a leather wallet con
taining some papers.
"I can't understand this," said Berry,
who appeared completely dazed. "I put
my band in my hip po'-ket to pull out the
wallet to show the Judge some papers
that would prove lam the man I repre
sent myself to be. a miner from Arizona,
and they all pounced upon me and hustled
me down here."
The Judge and Prosecuting Attorney
Mogan came to the prison in a few min
utes and on being told wnat Berry had in
tended doing the Judge told him to go
home.
"Well," said the Judge, "the man's ac
tion was so suggestive that being from
Arizona I naturally concluded he was
going to pull a gun. Besides, after mak
ing the threat on Saturday that he would
have a square deal I didn't know but what
he would get uely after I dismissed the
case."
A MILLIONAIRE'S SANITY
A. Cuneo, a Wealthy Wall-Street
Broker, Said to Have Lost His
Mind.
A. Cuneo, a Wall-street broker, who is
reported to be worth between $4,000,000
and 15,000,000, was sent to the Receiving
Hospital last evening to await an examin
ation by the Commissioners of Insanity.
Cuneo's office is at 54 Broadway, New
York, and his home is on Staten Island.
About two months ago he came to this
City for rest and to recover his health.
Abovit six weeks ago his brother-in-law,
Louis Demartini, who owns * large candy
factory on Mission street, caused Cuneo to
be taken to the Home for the Care of In
ebriates.
Two nights ago Cuneo left the place and
has since been wandering the City in a de
mented condition. Last night he was
taken to the hospital by E. M. Ratto, a
friend, who says that to-aay Demartini
will charge the millionaire with being in
sane.

HARNESS HORSES
AT INLESIDE,
Summer Meeting of the
Trotting- Horse Breeders'
Association.
WILL BE A BIG AFFAIR.
Trotters and Pacers From the
Entire Coast Will Compete
for Rich Purses.
TO BE NO TEDIOUS SCORING.
McNair, the Kn? of Sulky Starters,
Has Been Engaged to Send
the Horses Off
The summer rneetinc of the Pacific Coast
Trotting-horse Breeders' Association,
which is to be held at Ingleside June 27.
30 and July 1, 2, 3 and 4, promises to be in
E. P. Ucald, President of the Pacific Coast Trotting-Horse Breeders' Association
[From a photograph 6,y J. li. Hudson.]
many respects one of the most important '
series of harness-horse events which this
City ha? ever seen.
This is the first trotting meet which has
been held in thi? City for two years and
the lovers of sulky racing are looking for- I
waid to it with keenest anticipation. The
fine new track and the large number of
notable entries, which have beeu hereto- ;
fore published, promise most exceptional j
sport.
The association conducting this meet is
the larcest organization of its kind in
America and probably in the world. It
comprises the owners of all the leading
stock farms on the coast, as well as the
proprietors of smaller stables and individ
ual harness horses. It has been organized
since ISS9 and its first meet, held at the
now defunct Bay District track, was a
remarkab.e racing season. It was at this
event that Sunol, the pride of Senator
Stanford's farm, put the world's mark for
a mile at 2:oÃ><, and Regal Wiikes made
his first bow to horse-lovers as a record
breaker by capturing the world's record
for two-year-old stallions.
Since that time the association has given
meets at Napa, Sacramento, San Jose, Los ;
Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco, and '
each meet has been a decided success.
An argument sometimes used against
the attractiveness of harness races by '
those who are partial to the gallopers is
that the continued scoring necessarily
makes ttie events tedious for spectators. ;
That tedious scoring is not a necessary '
feature of thi3 class of racing was abund- I
antly proven at Los Angeles last year, !
when W. P. McNair, the famous starter,
sent the horses away with an average of
le?s than two scores for the entire six days.
This was justly deemed something re- j
markable, however, and it is generally .
conceded that few if any other starters
could do as well. In order that the asso- ;
ciation's patrons may have a minimum j
amount of the scoring nuisance McNair
his been secured for this occasion. Mr. '
McNair is a resident of Wichita, Kans., but
he is almost constantly employed in the
Kast traveling from one great race meet to
another. His labt engagement was in
Denver, from which place he is expected
to arrive in this City in a day or two.
There are at present about 200 horses in
training at the track. Among them are
the favorites of the track patrons of the
entire coast. The association has just ;
completed making up the programme of
events, and it will be seen an attractive j
series has been arranged for the opening
day. For the 2:30 class trot a purse of
$1000 has been hung up. While the 2:30,
class is considered a class for green horses, ;
from some of the entries fast time may be ;
expected, and others are very apt to sur- (
prise even the knowing onc e .
A purse of JlOuO has also been hung up:
for the 2: 15 trot, and this will perhaps be I
the star event of the day. Such horses as
Sam B, Naiive State, Bruno, Toggles, j
Maria P, Cmco and Jasper Avers have '
been entered, and a good contest must
necessarily result.
For the 2:23 pace the purse is not so
large, but the offer of $450 has been suffi
cient inducement to call forth seven first-'
class sidewheelers, and this race is confi- !
Jently expected to be one of the great
paces of the meet.
A glance at the programme will show
that the events have been selected in â 
a manner to insure an interesting time '
each day. A number of places have been j
reserved for special races, which will be
closed during the meeting. These will be j
made up so as to give races to all the j
best horsea at the track. The Gentlemen's
Driving Club of Alameda is to have a race,
la which owners are to drive, and the San ,
Francisco Driving Club will be similarly !
favored.
It is expected a long-distance race of I
throe miles for trotters and pacers witi be :
giving during the meeting, in addition to |
the regular events on the programme.
The association was never in better con- |
dition to conduct a succepsfal meet. Its
officers, headed by E. P. Heaid, proprietor j
of the Napa stock farm, are all energetic,
enthusiastic and experienced. The direc
tors comprise Borne of the best known
horsemen of the State, and their best ef
forts are all directed toward making this
meeting an event in the history of the
harness horse on this coast.
The following is the programme:
First day, Saturday, June 27â2 :30 class trot
liug purse, '2:ls class trotting purse, 2:25 class
paring purse.

USED A COBBLESTONE.
Trouble Between a Jessie-Street Saloon-
Keeper and a Â« ustotner.
John Conberry, a laborer in a sugar
refinery, appeared before Judge Joachim
sen yesterday to answer a charge of an
assault with a deadly weapon. The com
plaining witness, J. H. Flynn, a saloon
keeper at 137 Jessie street, testified that
Conberry went to his place on Sunday, and
after having several drinks, lor which he
refused to ray, assaulted him with a cob
blestone, which was produced in court.
Conberry swore that Flynn and several
customers threw liim into the street and
beat and kicked him. He admitted using
the cobblestoue, but said it was in self
defense.
The Judge seemed inclined to believe
Conberry's story, and continued the hear
ing for two days to enable him to bring
witnesses to testify to his previous good
character.

BUSINESS DISCOMMODED.
now the Krection of a New Building
Brought on a Big Sale.
The high board fence around The Call'b
new building has so shut off some ox the
merchants on the we?t bide of Third street
as to serious ; y interfere with trade. As a
result the Philadelphia Shoe Company, at
10 Third street, have begun a big sale by
marking everything down in their stock.
Their first day's effort to induce the
throngs from Market street proved a great
success. All day yesterday women and
men, young and old, poured in and out of
the doors. The sale is very appropriately
termed a "Blockade Hale" and will be con
tinued for t' c next thirty days.
WHY HE TOOK HIS LIFE
Midnight Attack of Robbers Two
Months Ago Unbalanced
Schmitt's Mind.
First Chloroformed and Then Left to
Die by Asphyxiationâ How
He Escaped.
Augustin Schmitt, the Montgomery
street liquor-dealer who committed suicide
on Sunday night by cutting his throat
with a butcher-knife, committed the rash
act while temporarily insane. An experi
ence he had nearly two months ago with
a couple of burglars brought about this
condition of affairs.
Six weeKs ago thieves entered his home
on Buchanan street and about the first
thing they did was to chloroform Scbmitt
After rifling the house of all the valuables
in sight they sought to add murder to the
crime by turning on the gas in the room
where lay the unconscious Schmitt. . i
For tunately, however, daylight came
shortly after the burgiars departed and
Schmitt was rescued. The affair weighed
h eavily on his mind and hardly a day I
passed that he did not make some indirect I
reference to it. In a letter to bis wife,
written evidently immediately prior to 'â 
the desperate act which resulted in his I
death, Schmitt says among other things:
Pan Francisco, June 20, 1806.
Dear Wife and Chi dren : It is with the deepest |
regret and sorrow that I am about going to â 
talic such a step as I have contemplated, but j
not on account of you. I would like to have ;
stayed with you to the time of my natural
death, but I cannot do it, I shall go to an
other place, where there are no burglars, no i
thieves and no swindlers. The last trouble I]
had with that class of people was enough for ;
me. Ido not want any more. â¢ â¢ â¢
Dear wife, it you ouly would lenow haw I |
feel to take surii a step, but I cannot overcome i
it. 1 have no rest ut niglif and cannot sleep; \
cannot eat. There is nota minute, either day or
night, that I do not think on it and worry my- j
self. â¢ â¢ â¢ All that lam glad of is that you j
are fairly well provided for. That is the best
gratification for me. You deserve it. You
have worked hard all your life.
All I wish is that these fellows, I say these
fellows because I think there was more than
one, will be punished to the fullest extent of
the law. Any man that commits such crimes
as that should be put away for all their life
time, so that they could not do any more
harm. There are a great many more who de
serve the same fate.
In conclusion Schmitt tells his wife to
"do right and fear nobody," adding that
he would have continued the fight if he
"had not met with that unfortunate
affair."

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE L' 3, 1896.
POPULISTS LOYAL
TO HEIR PARTY,
The Sentiment Here Is
Against Sacrifice by
Any Fusion.
DOUBTS ABOUT TELLER.
Both Populists and Democrats
Want Genuine, Straight-
Out Party Men.
WARDALL AND MAQUIRE TALK.
The California Delegation Distrusted
as the New Democratic Gold
Campaign Begins.
The confusion of the anti-McKinley ele
ments that has been rushed on the po
litical stage on the heels of the Republi
can convention presents a remarkable sit
uation in National politics, which is being
watched by politicians of all stripes here
as intently as in the East.
There has never in party history in
America been a time of such complete and
fateful uncertainty as to what will occur
within four weeks.
What union or what scattering of silver
forces will come forth from the uncertain
workings of the gold Democrats, the sil
ver Democrats, the Chicago convention,
for the control of which a new battle has
begun; the Teller bolt, now ready for co
quetting; the Silver party, which is ready
to indorse in all sorts of directions; the
Populist movement, which is still at sea,
and for the moment divided on Teller,
and from the side movements and plans
which are cropping out amid a condition
of political prospects which offers few
gambles at even money?
Will the Chicago convention, which will
meet two weeks from to-day, yield a radi
cal gold or a radical silver platform and
candidate or a straddle and a compromise
candidate? The gold administration
forces are rallying from the apparent rout
which followed the Kentucky victory for
silver and the predictions that gold will
control increase hourly from New York
to San Francisco.
As this is observed here, along with the
news that the administration forces,
backed by the banking and other gold in
fluences in the party, will strain every
nerve to capture convention votes to be
marshiileri under the popular leadership
of Whitney, there are hourly Increasing
expressions of opinion that from one-third
to one-half of the California delegation
will vote on the side of gold at Chicago.
The California delegation is distrusted
by free-silver Democrats, and is believed
by others to be surely divided on the
issue. Dagnett will here lead the adminis
tration efforts to convert delegates from
the free-siiver heresy. The mails will
bring to several delegates with gold lead
ings all sorts of appeals and arguments
from high sources, and every possible pull
that can be brought to bear will be felt by
them.
When the recent State Convention was
over the leading lieutenants of the Dag
gett-gold forces said: "Ha! Ha! They
got a silver plahk and we named the
men."
The Democratic State Convention
adopted a radical whole-hog, free-silver
plank, and the Congressional district con
ventions named a lot of goldbugs as dele
gates to Chicago. The silver men had no
organization and no leaders.
The convention went to silver largely
because the party tide seemed to have set
that way and partly becauee the Federal
brigade had abandoned the fight, which it
bus taken up again within two days. One
third of the convention voted for Reed's
gold resolution, and the third would have
i been n< arly or fully a half had the gold
i campaign been vigorously kept up. The
! State Convention resolved that the dele
â  gates were pledged to vote for silver, but
the district delegates are free to declare
I that they were elected by Congressional
i conventions and are not pledged.
The California delegation will not be a
corps of silver heroes, ready for the last
ditch, and of many such delegations will
the Chicago convention be composed,
giving the solid gold forces of the East the
lighting chance they are taking and
making estimates of the silver majority in
{ the convention little more than guesses at
1 this moment.
Is there any possibility of the Demo
j crats and Populists coming to an under
! standing? is, perhaps, the question of
! greatest moment, for such a union of the
silver forces, bacited by the silver party,
j presents the only real danger to the Re
publicans. Conflicting opinionscome from
all directions, but the strong and natural
party conservatism, which demands a
straight-out-dyed-in-the-wool parly man
whom anybody may get in and vote for
that will, may be seen to be the thing that
wiil undoubtedly prevent the forming of
any hybrid Democratic party. The Demo
cratic party is proud of what causes it â its
record â and too many Democrats have
' love and loyalty for the imaginary entity
"party," on which affections come to rest,
to nominate Mr. Teller, as the Republican
! bolters are now pleading to have done.
1 Most local Democrats express opinions
which agree on the Teller point with that
; given yesterday by Congressman Maguire.
Will the Populist convention by any
possibility indorse a Democratic free silver
nominee? The opinions of the Populist
leaders here are unanimous in the nega
tive. As with the Democrats the sacrifice
of "the party" is an impossibility. The
Farty means more than silver, they say.
i is the expression of a revolutionary
: force opposed to the old parties. There
are campaigns beyond this one and the
' Populist party has cost too much and rep
resents too much to be thrown away by
merging with a party that is torn, insin
j cere and full of what Populists abhor.
, This is the general average of Populist
i sentiment here and it is expressed in the
talk with State Chairman Wardall which
follows.
The Populists out here are at searegard
; ing Teller and they discuss with care the
: individual action of Taubeneck, National
; chairman, and the 3everal other Populists
now at St. Louis in issuing an address in
viting the Populist party to take up Tel
; ler.
At the Populist State headquarters it is
j said that but three or four of those who
' signed the address advocating Teller are
: men of commanding position in the party,
and that their action is but an expression
jof individual preference. The Populists
! here like Teller, but he is not a Populist
yet, and they don't just know about it.
Mr. Wardall was one of the committee
I of seven which went from the meeting of
j the Populist National Committee at St.
; Louis to meet the silver men at Washing-
I ton, this conference resulting in the ar
j rangement to hold both National conven
j tions at St. Louis on July 22 that, any pos-
I sibility of union might he facilitated.
"I don't think there is any possibility of
union except with the silver men," said
Mr. Wardall, and his sentiments were in
harmony with those of George D. Gil
lespie, A. 13. Kinne and others there.
"1 don't know what Mr. Teller's prin
ciples are except as to the silver question,
but I don't think it possible that the
Populists xviH nominate him unless he
comes out openly for the People's party.
He is a Republican and I thinfc we will
come to him in the tariff plank I expect
to see adopted by the National Conven
tion calling for protection to American
labor and producers and the relegation of
the tariff to a non-partisan business com
mission.
J'The address from St. Louis is non-com
mittal and shows an individual indorse
ment of Teller. Those who signed it are
in no position to say what the party will
do. I admire Teller and it is possible that
if he goes to the silver convention at St.
Louis and union with the Populists is in
vited I will feel ready to support him."
"It seems to me now that the chances
are that the election will be thrown into
tLe House. There is no possibilty of our
nominating the Democratic nominee. The
Democratic party may adopt a radical free
silver dank, but that "is only one of our de
mands. We are the anti-monopoly party
and free silver is only part of our financial
policy, though it is the most important
one.
"Our chances of recruiting from the Re
publican party are too good now to throw
away the results of years of labor in build
ing up the party. To combine with the
Democrats would be throwing away the
party. We would not fee! able to trust a
Democrat for Congress even, if we made a
combination. We couldn't afford to elect
a Democratic Congressman unless he
pledged himself to stay out of a Demo
cratic caucus for the selection of Speaker
of the House, and Democratic Congress
men we elected we could not control. 1
have spent years of labor and thonsands
of dollars without a dime of recompense
in the work of building up the party, and
if now ii was to be disrupted and thrown
away by indorsing a Democratic candidate
for the Presidency I would feel like going
back to work on rcy farm.
"We are ready to combine with the In
dependent Free Silver party. We say to
the silver men, 'Meet us in St. Louis July
22 and we will divide things on fair and
equal terms.' We will treat the men who
leave their parties and come out and stand
with us as well as we do our own people.
I think anyway that this silver fight wiil
continue a number of years before it is
settled.
"Another consideration is that the Dem
ocratic party has gone to silver as a mat
ter of policy mainly. That is one reason
why there can be no union. The Popu
lists are united and sincere in what they
believe and will vote only for men they
believe to be sincere. As to the Demo
cratic National Convention, my opinion
noÂ»v is that it will adopt a money plank
that is neither fish nor flesh."
"There will be no combinations on legis
lative candidates in this City," said George
D. Gillespie. "There will be a straight
out Populist ticket of Assemblymen aud
Senators."
Congressman James G. Maguire gave j
some further opinions about the National !
situation yesterday. He believes that
there is no chance of the Democratic Na- :
tional Convention taking up Teller or any
body else who is not a true-blue Democrat
as well as a silver man.
"It seems to me that the Teller bolt was
a logical and necessary result of the Re
publican National Convention," said Mr.
Miitfuire, "and that if Teller should run as
a silver candidate he will undoubtedly re
ceive a very large vote from the silver
Republican! in all the StateÃ of the West, !
including Ilinois, Ohio, lowa, California,
Oregon and Washington. I think the re- ;
suit will be the election of Democratic
electors from all the States west and south :
of Pennsvivania, provided, of course, mat
the Democratic party shall, as I believe it
will, adopt a silver platform and nominate
Strong silver candidates.
"1 do not at present see any possibility
of Teller's nomination by the Democrats, i
The nominee of that convention must be a
Democrat who stands for the other prin
ciples enunciated in the Democratic plat
form as well as the silver plunk.
"The chances of the election gome into !
the House I regard as very strong. In |
fact, it will go there unless the Democrats I
get a majority of the electoral vote, and as ;
the present Housp has a Republican ma- I
jnrity of over 100, MrKiniey would be j
elected. 1 dont believe that the Repubii- ]
cans can get a majority of the electoral
vote on a gold plattorm."

FOOTPADS ARE
KEEPING IT UP,
A Japanese Shoemaker
Nearly Beaten to
Death.
ROBBED OF HIS WATCH
Lively Experience of Charles
Kendrick, Cashier in a Cor
ner Grocery.
HE COMES OFF VICTORIOUS.
Two of the Many Cases Which the
Police Want to Keep to Them
selves.
Burglars and footpads are taking the
fullest advantage of the idiotic policy of
the Supervisors in Bhutting off the street
lights to do as large a business as possible.
The police are doing their utmost to
keep the reports to themselves, but occa
sionally a few leak out, anil two holdups
are among the number.
Handi Naojiro, employed in the Japa
nese 3hoestore of C. Sekeni at 223 Ellis
street, after stopping work on Saturday
night went to a barber-shop on Sacra
mento street. He left there shortly after
11 o'clock to go to his room at 228 Ellis
street. He walked along Stockton street,
and between California and Pine he no
ticed two men following closely behind
him. He paid no attention to them, but
when he reached Bush street they were
close behind him, and he was knocked
down by a blow on the head from Borne
heavy instrument.
After knocking him down they kicked
him on the head until he becama uncon
scious. When he regained consciousness,
in about fifteen minutes, he found that his
silver watch and chain and a bunch of
keys had been stolen. His head was cut
in several places, and although he was
weak from the loss of blood he managed to
walk home. A physician was called in
who attended to his wounds, and last
night he was on a fair way to recovery.
He could give no description of the two
footpads.
Charles Kendrick, cashier in a grocery
at California and Fillmore streets, yester
day related his remarKable experience
with a footpad on Sunday night.
He had been out with a lady friend, and,
after taking her home, iie went to the
corner of Masonic avenue and Pase street
to wait for v car to go home. It was not
so very dark, as the moon was shedding
her soft light and the electric lights at the
chutes were not far distant.
Kendrick heard stealthy footsteps be
hind him. He was not thinking oi foot
pads and paid no attention to the foot
step*. Soon a man, wearing an overcoat
with the collar turned up and a black
Derby hat pulled well down over his eyes,
stood in front of him. The man had his
hands in his overcoat pockets, and, after
glancing up and down the street, pulled a
gun out of the pocket of his overcoat and,
pointing it at Kendrick, quietly remarked,
"Shell out, young fellow."
Kendrick was startled for a moment and
blurted out, "Please don't harm me."
Then, instead of shelling out, he regained
his courage and took advantage of an un
guarded movement of *he footpad to
snatch the revolver out of his hand and
knock him down. When he got the foot
pad down he kicked him on the head and
body till he yelled for mercy, and strug
gling to hia feet disappeared in the dark
ness.
Kendrick retained possession of the re
volver as a memento of his victory over
the footpad. It is a rusty old thing and
gave signs of being well oiled. When
a^ked why he did not fire at the footpad
when he paw him running away lie buid
he was afraid of missing him and he
might have returned with a knife. He
said the footpad looked like a "dope fiend"
and he thought he might know him again.
PUNY MAN
!â  he who, by burning both ends of the
candle, by dissipation, by nights of sleep-
lessness, by days of hard mental or phys-
ical work, has made himself nerveless,
melancholy, weak, vibrating. Why should
this be so? Why should one of Nature's
best handiwork be a poor, feeble,
PUNY MAN
Whose look is gaunt, whose step is feeble,
who is ever and anon compelled to hold
himself to pillar, to post, who is ever
dizzy, who has flicking specks and glim-
mering dots sparking and bewildering his
â who sees nature, man, life and all
through the smoky glass, despair? Do
you want to be always a
PUNY MAN
A prematurely decayed man? If you
don't you should at once study over and
consult about that which makes pound
men. It is the great remedio-treatment â
the wonderful specific that has been the
highest, the greatest boon to humanity
It is the great Hudyan. This great remedy

COUNTY HOSPITAL SUPPLIES.
Fish That Were Sometimes "Past"
and Meat That Came at Fancy
Figures.
TbÂ« Board of Health continued its in
vestigation of the County Hospital Jast
evening at the office of Dr. Hart, 114 Pow
ell street. Two witnesses were examined â
George Robinson, the steward, and his
son, George F. Robinson, who was acting
steward for two months during his father's
illness.
The elder Robinson testified that his du
ties included general supervisiom of the
commissary department and of the buiid
inps. Every week he makes a requisition
of supplies needed for the institution and
.13 it to the Superintendent for ap
proval. He then has to take the requisi
tion to the Cbafrman of the Hospital Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors, Joseph
Kiue. According to Robinson he seeks
King at the City Hall during his supposed
oilice hours, but rarely find* him there.
Generally he has to hunt for Kine at the
latter's hotel, and more particularly in the
barroom of the hotel.
On certain occasions when it was impos
sible to find the Supervisor of the Fir*Â«t
Ward even in the seclusion of his own bar
room the steward was compelled to usk
dealers to furnish supplies without a re
quisition ana to get the requisition signed
later on.
Robinson, as a rule, goes with a requisi
tion to the chairman of the Hospital Com
mittee about four times a week, but often
he has to go st-vertil time.-j a day to tind
King. The steward admitted "that he
often lost a great deal of time chasing
back and forth between the City Hall and
King's hotel.
Kobinson said he had very little trouble
about the shortage in weight or measure
of the supplies furnished the hospital.
The trouble was with the quality.
The lish furnished the institution was
often poor â not rotten, but what the stew
ard euphoniously termed "Dast."' He had
also received bay and potatoes that were
unfit for use. On such occasions the goods
were always sent back and the dealers sent
good supplies. The cartage of these sup
j>:i^s back and for:li, of course, made an
additional expense for the hospital.
The quality of beef furnished to the
ai was very good, according to the
steward.
i ontraet price, however, at which it
was furnished tv the hospital was much
)i ttiiin tie regular market price.
. -ure he could have bought
:ine qualltv of meat which was being
furnished at ti' 2 cents a pound for 4.,
cents, lie was> positive he could have
saved the City from $1500 to $20u0 during
the past fiscal year on meat alone, if he
had had the buying of it. However, even
if he had wished to do so, he had not the
power.
In buying goods not contracted for he
go to certain dealers recommended
by the Hospital Committee. If the Board
oi Health should order him to go to an
other tirm who would furnish goods
cheaper he would probably be unable to
get ti.e eoods, as the chairman of the hos
pital committee would refuse to sign the
requisition and the dealer would not get
â â¢>'â¢
â¢Then you mean to say," asked Dr.
Hart, "that although an appointee of the
iioard of Healtn you are under the power
of the committee of the Supervisors, and
that the Board of Health has nothing to
do with the matter?'
"It seems to be that way," answered
Robin -
Young Robinson was asked the same
questions as his father and corroborated
his statements. He recounted a visit he
made to Cuairman Kine with a requisi
tion, when tiie Supervisor delighted the
politicians in hia barroom by declaring he
would not allow certain supplies to the
hospital. Robinson denied that he had
jutted King on the back on this occasion
and said: "Good boy, Joe."
At the conclusion of young Robinson's
testimony the board adjourned to meet
ligain next week, when more of the hos
pital employes will be examined.
IN AID OF THE CHARTER.
Prominent Organizations Ad
dress the Election Com
mission.
Resolu!ioa Passed Placing the Charter
at the Head of the Electoral
Ballot.
The Merchants' Association and other
prominent organizations, represented by
Joseph Britton, president of the Board of
Freeholders; Captain William L. Merry,
secretary of the Chamber of Commerce;
I. J. Truman, president of the Civic Federa
tion; W. G. Doaue, director of the Mer
chants' Association; F. W. Dohrmaun,
;ent of the Merchants' Association,
and J. Richard Freud, secretary of the
Merchants' Association, appeared before
action Commissioners yesterday to
urge that the proposed new charter be
given a prominent place on the electoral
ballot at the next election.
Joseph Britton opened the discussion by
stating that at the invitation of the Board
i tion Commissioners the committee
was present to urge the placing of the
charier in a favorable position upon the
al ticket.
F. W. Dohrmann then addressed the
committee for the purpose of showing the
necessity of placing the words "for the
new charter" or "against the newcharter '
in such a position upon the ballot that it
would not be overlooked. He then asked
tne Commissioners whether there was any
necessity for discussion of this subject.
Commissioner Block offered a resolution
authorizing the Registiar to prepare the
ballot so that the charter would appear at
the head of the municipal ticket. This
resolution gave rise to some discussion in
which it became apparent that all the
members of the board were favorable to
the resolution, but were not certain that
the board had the legal authority to so
arrange the ballot.
Auditor Broderick stated that he was
FtrontjJy in favor of having the position of
the charter at the head of the municipal
ticket, but that there was some question
under what election laws the Commis
sioners were operating. It might be
possible that the power resided with the
County Clerk.
An amendment was offered by Com
missioner Creswell that the Board was
favorable to the resolution as submitted
by Commissioner Block, provided it had
the power. In this shape the resolution
was unanimously adopted by the Com
missioners.
. In order to hring the matter to a test as
soon as possible, a resolution was offered
by Commissioner Creswell that the Board
authorize ihe Registrar to purchase a cer
tain amount of ballot paper from the
Secretary of State and proceed to the
arrangement and printing of the ballot.
This resolution was also unanimously
adopted by the Commissioners.
The subject of appointing election
officers for the ensuing election, on No
vember ;>, was then discussed. Mr. Dohr
mann, on behalf of the Merchants' Asso
ciation, presented to the Registrar for the
use of the election board, a list of 2000
leading mercantile houses of this City who
employ cierical help.
This" list comprises the 523 members of
of the Merchants' Association and the
leading commercial houses, and will be
used by the kegtstrar in sending out a
special circular requesting merchants to
recommend their clerks for election offi
cers. Application blanks will be sent with
each circular, to be properly rilled out
and returned to the Registrar's office.
Mr. Dohrmann explained that the object
of the Merchants' Association was to co
operate harmoniously with the Election
Commissioners in securing efficient ana
reliable clerks of election.
'lhe Merchants' Association will send a
special request to each of these 2000 firms
that they comply with the wishes of the
Election Commissioners. Active efforts
will also be taken by the association to
secure desirable clerks in every precinct of
the City at the next election with a special
view of securing a full and accurate couni
of the votes polled upon the new charter.
A HUGE GRADING JOB,
Warren and O'Malley Have Al
most Two Years' Work
in Richmond,
Residents of the District Have a Com
p'aint Against the Street
Department.
For the next two years Richmond Dis- !
trict will be the scene of extensive grading
operation?, and millions of yards of sand
will be handled. Besides the old Bay Dis- j
trict racetrack work, Warren it O'Malley |
have a large tract between Eighth and j
Fifteenth avenues and A and C streets. |
This is a job of about forty blocks and is â¢
covered with sandhills, many of them ;
thirty feet higher than the street. Much
Of it is dry sand, the banks having been j
recently formed by the wind, and the
graders to remove it will use the big steam '
machines known as 'Sand-paddies."
A "sand-paddy" is not as diminutive or |
modest a piece of mechanism a? one would i
fancy. On the contrary, it is a monster j
that eats into a sandhill at the rate of 1800 !
or 1900 cubic yards a day. By a series of 'â 
scoops or buck?t3 run by endless sprocket
chains the soil is elevated into a hopper,
thence into railroad cars, which run on
their tracks around the machine receiving
their load, which is emptied into the cut
to be filled. The "paddy" itself stands on ,
rails, and after it has used up all the pand- '
banks within reach it is rolled forward and
the cartrack again arranged around it.
The whole system is perfect in the way of
utility and "practicability, and the work
advance* rapidly.
\\ arren it .O'Malley will soon have two j
steamers at work, one at the sand-dune
west of the Odd Fellows' Cemetery on the j
old racetrack and the other on the forty- :
block job, wnere it will dig steadily for a
year and a half. When it has scooped up
its last bucket of sand a wide strip of high
rolling land lyinpr along the north side of ,
Golden (iate Park will be leveled down
and ready for the builders.
The residents of Richmond District are ;
I complaining bitterly of the action of the j
I Street Committee in foisting upon them
Gray Bros.' blue rock. Not only are the
quarries far away, but the small property
owners of the locality at tiie present time '
find that additional expense ahardship.
The people of the district hold that as so
much of that part of the City is ungraded
and often streets are mere cuts tnrough
sandhills it is not practicable to be^m a
system of costly paving. They wish to use |
the red rock of which they have an j
unlimited supply at a quarry on Thirtieth \
avenue for temporary street work. It is i
their intention in the near future to Ditu
minizfl every street in the district, when
the blue rock will be used as a bed for the j
i bitumen. A3 it i 3 the red rock has a ;
I natural cement which gums the whole j
' mess, and a thoroughfare paved with this [
j after being well rolled makes one of the
: cheapest and best roadways Known.
J. <j. Conway, a grader residing in Rich- |
mond District, stated yesterday that the
people of his locality were going to make
the paving question a living issue this
summer.
"Many of our streets," said he, "are in
a deplorable condition at present, and
what will they be in the wet season? They |
| have been dug up for sewers, gas ana j
water mains until they are soft and need j
paving. But we can't afford to pay 7 and
B cents a square foot for blue rock, for that j
is too costly. We could have it done in
oar own red rock for 3^ cents. Talk S
about an octopusâ l tell you there is no
more unjust and crushing monopoly in
this City than the Gray Brothers and their
blue rock. We have a number of times
sent committees to the board for redress
and there they always found one of the I
Grays ready to fight them.
"Here is another thing of the many evils
that arnct us. The other day the 'Street
Department served notices ordering ttiat j
the sidewalk alone Sixth avenue snould
be bituminized. Part of the thorough- j
fare between Point Lobos avenue and the j
partc not only has no buildings on it, but ,
is Hanked by deep, ungraded lots; and, |
moreover, 1 have been at work in sight of i
that street every day for three weeks, and j
I have not seen over twenty people walK- i
ing by. What the department wants j
those sidewalks paved now for is a ques- I
tion past finding out.
"Now if we work out streets at all â
j which they need â we must use the hard
I blue rock, which is the poorest material i
that can be put down. It will not pack, I
and either grinds up into fine dust, to ;
i turn to mud in winter, or remains a hard |
j gravel in the streets. We want the red >
i rock put down now, and when we are able !
J to do costly street work we will bit.uniin- |
ize. The Street Department need not fear i
that Richmond District will fail to mi- ]
prove itself in the Dest manner possible. |
We want a square deal, and we will con- |
j tend for it, too."

An <>ld Cage Decided.
I The United States Court of Appeals affirmed j
I yesterday the decision of the District Court, j
j in the case of The Humboldt Lumber Manu- j
| facturers' Association against Olivia Christo- i
pherson and others. The suit is one of nearly |
seven years' standing, and was carried to the |
Court of Appeals on a mandate to secure a
stay of proceedings. The case is now referred !
back to the District Court for execution. In
1889 the tug Printer, owned by tne Humboldt !
i couipauy was towing out to sea the (-choouer j
I Fidelity. In some way thelatterran foul of the i
I rocks and several lives were loKt. Suits were at }
! once instituted against the lumber people by
I the families of the victims for $54,000 dam- j
ages. Tht District Court held that the owners !
of tne tug were only responsible to ihe value I
of the vessel, which was appraised at $22,500. i
A judgment for that amount was accordingly \
rendered. The Humb:>ldt company disclaimed
any liability whatever, and asked for the utay
of proceedings as already related.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 23, 1896.
SHEA & SHEA TO
BUILD THE HALL
The Contract for the New
Municipal Building
Awarded.
END OF THE DEADLOCK.
Supervisors Wagner and Benja
min Finally Changed
Their Votes.
WORK WILL SOON BE BEGUN.
The Pesthouse Will N.t Be Located
on the Almshouse Tract
at Present.
The Board of Supervisors settled the
question as to who shall be the architect
to construct the new municipal building
yesterday by giving the plum to Shea it
Shea.
The board has been in a deadlock for
several months past (in fact, ever since
the numerous designs for the building
were submitted), Shea & Shea being one
vote short of enough to get the contract,
while the nearest rival, W. 0. Banks,
lacked two votes. Yesterday when the
balloting was taken up seven ballots were
cast without any result being attained,
but on the eighth the change came. It
was first in evidence when Supervisor Ben
jamin, who has been an enthusiastic sup
porter of Banks from tne first, raised his
voice for Shea it Shea, and the choice was
assured when Supervisor Wagner deserted
Mooser & Mooser, for whom he has voted
persistently, and also voted for Shea &
Shea.
Later a resolution was adopted instruct
ing the architects to call at once on the
Municipal Buildings Committee of the
board with a view to arranging tor the im
mediate beginning of wort on the
structure.
The report of A. F. Knorp to the finance
committee of the County Hospital build
ings was submitted, showing the struc
tures to be in a generally good condition,
but needing some improvements. Among
theie was a new one-story building for in
fectious diseases. The total estimated
cost was $21,278, $ 14,77* to be for the new
building. The repon called attention to
the fact that since 1872 the total expendi
ture on t.'ie hospital buildings had been
f175,Â«6584.
Mayor Sutro occupied his chair for the
first time since he was granted his vaca
tion two months a^o, and was visibly
pleased when the Pesthouse ghost that has
been troubling him so long was finally
"laid."
When the resolution locating the hos
pital for contagious diseases on the Alina
j,ouse tract came up its passage was
oved. Supervisor King wanted the mat
. r laid over for a month, but this measure
(jjd not carry and the original motion was
i st by one vote.
Acting Mayor Taylor's veto of the box
i_ g ordinance was read and sent to print.
q olonel Taylor also made the following
r ecommendations regarding future box-
i ng entertainments:
In conclusion, permit me to make the sug
gestion that if It is still the determination of
this honorable body to pass order No. 3000,
then it should be amended in the three fol
lowing particulars:
Kirsiâ After the application is presented to
this body, and before action thereon is taken
by the comniittee. the application should
be referred to the Chief of Police with direc
tions that he shall, with convenient dispatch,
file with such committee his written opinion
as to the granting or refusal of such applica
tion, giving his reasons therefor.
â  Secondâ Kach and every contest under such
permit should be limited to live (6j rounds, no
round exceeding three (3) minutes in time.
Thirdâ livery permit Issued by this board
shall be approved by the Mayor before it
tinally becomes valid.
The matter will come up for a decision
next Monday.
The long delayed resolution in relation
to the fees of the Sheriff's ottlce that are not
paid into the treasury was finally passed.

THEY CAN'T AGREE
0N A REFEREE.
Corbett Wants Alva King
and the Sharkey People
Hiram Cook.
TWO CONFERENCES HELD
Denver Ed Smith Challenges
Corbett to Fight in
South Africa.
THE CHAMPION LAUGHS AT IT.
Another Conference Will Be He 1 d
To-Day on Refereeâ How
the Pools Sell.
Not more adorned than Adam under
the blossoms of the Garden of Eden, Tom
Sharkey, in the pink of condition, climbed
into pink silk lingerie after his bath and
ruD down yesterday afternoon in Oakland.
He strips a muscular wonder.
The few friends who were gathered
around him in the dressing apartments of
the Acme Athletic Club were inclined to
josh the sailor lad on his elegant under
wear. This was said in piain words:
"Get onto the drawers!"
SiiarKey is no marine at repartee. He
got back at them quickly and in these
words:
"Nothing is too good for the Irish. I'Jl
buy a suit of another color next Wednes
day night after I meet Corbett."
Sharkey is easing up in his work. Yes
terday he put in only about an hour, and
took an unusually good rub down at the
hands of his trainer, Needliam, and an
assistant. He will train a little to-day,
but on Wednesday, on the eve of battle,
he will not do any hard work at all. Need
ham says that on Wednesday Sharkey
will take a short walk to Keep himself
limbered up and the bellows of his lungs
in good order. The remainder of the day
he will rest. He weighed 177 pounds yes
terday. He will weigh in for the fight at
177 or 17*. He will wear green trunks and
the red, white and b\\w in the ring.
When asked yesterday what line of at
tack or battle he anticipated from Corbett,
be said:
I do not know what he is going to do.
anct I do riot know what I'll do till I get
into the ring. A man in the ring never
knows till he gets there. The training is
about over now, and you can depend on

and if I am licked it will not be from lack

four rounds all right."
"Will you put up any money?"
â¢'Sure." 1 do not know how much. 1
can't tell till the betting opens, but I'll
stand to win or lose quite a roll."
Not desirine to put his enemy ia posses
sion of his plan of battle, Sharkey re
fused to say what tactics he expects to
pursue. This much is certain, that the
big crowd ai MeohaiiicV Pavilion to-mor
row nijht will --cc in the sailor lad a twen
nr-year-old lit to make the battle of
bis life, and he realizes his opportunity.
That portion of the usual programme of
training for pugilists which has been
neglected or omitted most by Needham
and his charge is sparring. The most of
the work has been in punching the bag,
skipping the rope, tossing the big, heavy
medicine ball and laboring at the wrist
and back machines.
If tbis fact signifies anything it means
that .Sharkey will not attempt a scientific
sparring-match with the scientific world's
champion, but will, on the other hand, de
vote his attention to defense, and putting
up that kind of a defence which will best
enable him to stay four rounds.
At the same time it must be remem
bered that he says he does not intend to
run away, but means to do some of the
fighting. He has a right-hand swine and
an upper cut that pleases even himself, for
while bombarding the bag he has been
jioticed time and again to smile to uimself
at the way he does. Sharkey says: "If I
hit Corbett he'll go down like the rest of
them."
The champion pugilist of the world is
training riclit up to date at the Olympic
Athletic Club. He worked pretty hard
yesterday, perhaps harder than ever. Ibis
fact may mean either that Corbett is de
termined to put Sharkey to sleep in one
round, or that he is beginning to realize
that he may have more of a contract on
his hands than he first understood. The
champion is in fairly good shape, and if
he makes the battle that his friends Know
he is capable of making, their money says
that the sailor lad will not last long."
It will all be over in about fifteen min
utes anyhow. From the rate at which re
served seats are going people will spend
about $20,000 to see a fifteen-minute show,
and under any condition Corbett will get
half the money.
This is a rapid ase; anything over $600
a minute is making money with some
speed.
Corbett has a system of training of his
own. It differs from that of most other
gladiators of the ring. It has been the rule
with him, even in finish fights, to work as
hard as ever on the day of the fight. The
fact that he kept right up to the scratch
yesterday points out that he will continue
at it up to and including Wednesday.
Corbett had a good deal of sparring
exercise yesterday â more than usual. He
kept two men busy defending themselves
and gasping for breath. He sparred with
Hislop ami George Green. "Young Cor
bett." The former is a h<>avy- weight spar
ring celebrity of the Olympic Club. He
made Corbett keep his fists up all the
time and made a good showing. Green
went at the champion hammer and tongs,
but Corbett managed to remain on his
feet. Green takes advantage of the oppor
tunity and is learning something.
There was the usual game of handball.
It was a very lively one. and was played by
Corbett and Harlo against Hampton and
Pookwitc The champion and his partner
were not in it yesterday at this game.
They were beaten two out of three.
The public betting will open to-morrow,
and possibly it may begin to-night. Cor-
Lett is the favorite on this side of the bay,
but most if not all of the Oakland ruoney
will go up on Sharkey. Hundreds have
been admitted to see him train, and
he is a favorite over there on the four
round proposition.
The sale of general admission, or gallery
<-f-ats, will open the night of the contest at
the Dox-offive.
The representatives of the principals in
the Mechanics' Pavilion pugilist event
have met on the subject of the ref'-ree and
had a conference. In fact, they had two
conferences, and without result.
A -nag has been struck on the question
of who shall decide the bout, and the ap
]. i. -trances ar^tbat it will require a good
(!f-al ot jawbone to remove it. A great
deal of jawbone was used yesterday after
linen, Lacked by some stubbornness on
each side.
In the afternoon the name of AI"X Greg
gains was proposed for referee. There was
some objection to tbis from both sides,
and after the mere mention of two or
three other names the meeting broke up.
In the evening another meeting was
held in Corutu a saloon on Ellis
street, at which the champion and his
brother Harry were present.
Alva King was proposed by the Corbett
people for referee, and Dan Lynch and
his adherents suggested Hiram Cook.
They said Mr. Cook was acceptable to
them, and they thought his standing in
sporting circles ousrht to make him ac
ceptable to Corbett.
But the champion and his friends ob
jected to Cook and stuck to King. Cor
bett does not want Cook because he called
the Corbett-Jackson tutu a draw when
Corbett thought he should have had the
decision.
On the other hand the Sharkey people
will not agree to King when such men as
Cook may be had, and there you are.
Another conference will be held to-day.
If the principals can reach no agreement
the choice of a referee will, under the ar
ticles of agreement, fall to the National
Athletic Club.
At the pool celling last night the money
offered was $10 to $7 on Corbett and
Sharkev, and $1U to $8 on Smith ana Davis.
DENVER ED COMES ALONG.
He Challenges Corbett to Fiffht In
South Africa.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 22.â"Den
ver" Ed Smith looms as the unknown
whom J. Hildebrandt of Johannesburg,
South Africa, will back against Corbett or
Fitzsimmons to fight for the champion
ship of the world. Hildebranat and Smith
were at the Police Gazette office to-day,
and authorized the following telegram to
be sent to Corbett, who is now in San
Francisco:
"Will you fight Denver Ed Smith, bare
knuckles, London prize-ring rules, for the
championship of the world and $10,000 a
side in South Africa. Name date your
self. .Hildebrandt posted $10,000. Fight
guaranteed. Richard K. Fox."
Smith said it was his intention to chal
lenge Fitzsimmons if Corbett refused and
if the Australian refused to meet him he
would claim the championship and defend
it against any man in the world.
When seen last nicht about Richard K.
Fox's telegram Corbett said that the chal
lenge of "Denver" Ed Smith is too silly to
talk about.
"The idea of my going to South Africa
to fight a man who has been defeated
asain and again is absurd.
"Of course, I am the champion and
every man will challenge me. Please tell
the press that I consider this challenge too
absurd to talk about."

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 23, 1896.
KATIE KEENAN
WAS MURDERED,
The Autopsy Held by Dr.
Barrett Reveals This
Fact.
HAD MANY ASSOCIATES.
But None of Them Has as Vi
Been Apprehended by the
Police.
ARREST OF MRS.
She Is the Woman Supposed to Have
Attended the Girl During Her
Last Illness.
The autopsy performed by Dr. Barrett
on the remains of Katie Keenan showed
that the woman died as the result of a
criminal operation.
It. had been evident to her friends for
some time past that she was in a delicate
condition. She was living with her mother
at bb\\i Stevenson street until she disap
peared four days ago, when she took ud
quarters with her friend, Mrs. E. Mc-
Carthy, at 26 Caroline street.
Mrs. McCarthy acted the part of a friend
who did all she could to assist the sufferer,
and when she began to fear that the end
was at hami she called In Dr. Henry Â±5. A.
Kuyeler. The latter arrived prior to the
death of the woman and could do nothing
to help her. She was unconscious and
could make no statement.
The Coroner took charge of the remains,
and when Dr. Barrett concluded his ex
amination the police set out to arrest the
men and women who have been identi
fied as closely connected with the case.
Mrs. McCarthy's statement to Captain
Lees was such that she was not detained
longer than was necessary to take down
her declaration.
The accoucheuse, Mrs. Balckwell, 60
Morris avenue, however, was treated
otherwise. She was placed in charge of
the police matron, and ihe charge of mur
der may be placed at any moment against
her name on the City Prison register.
Mrs. Balckwell refused to make any
statement when seen yesterday, neither
affirming nor denying that she had at
tended the dead woman. She acknowl
edged, however, that she knew the girl,
who had been introduced to her by a lady
"whose name has been published in the
papers." As the only other woman's
name besides Balckwell and Keenan pub
lished is that of Mrs. McCarthy, it is to be
presumed that it is this iady to whom she
alludes. The latter, however, does not
know the accoucheuse, so she says, and
only took in her sick friend as a mere act
of charity.
The unfortunate dead woman lived with
her heartbroken mother off and on at her
Sievenson-street home. She worked at
I times in various factories, earninea rather
I precarious living. Her immediate asso
| ciates were men about the factories and
tAre You Weak?
Some Points on the Development of
True Manhood by Electricity-
Reasons Why Dr. Sanden's Elec-
tric Belt Is the Only Sure Remedy
for the Recovery of This Vital
______________________
What a great amount of happiness ie destroyed by this
terrible drain which is called Nervous Debility ! You see the
evidences of it in the faces of more than half the people you
meet.
This great country of ours is a nation of nerves ; nerves
which have been drained of their vital force ; nerves which are
â  trying out for help. And why don't we help them? Why don't
we replace the energy which has been stolen from them ?
Because the medical profession, to whom we always go in
time of sickness, has no menns at hand to restore nerve power
Drugs never build up weak nerves without taking the strength
from other organs of the body.
That don't pay. You might as well be sick one way as
another. If you are going to steal from your kidneys, your liver
and your stomach the energy to give temporary nourishment to
your nerves you'd better better let your nerves suffer and save
your stomach anyway.
"I'm tired of drugging." We hear that remark every day
It's the wail of the nerveless man who has lost all confidence ir.
the old, worn-out system of medicine.
"I was nervous and broken down from debility. Along in the afternoon I would get so
tired and weak that I could not finish my day's work. A month after I began to wear your
Belt my strength had fully returned, and since then I have been as well and strong as ever, in
my life." ed M. PIERCE,
Guadaloupe Dairy, Fifteenth avenue and San Bruno road, San Francisco.
That shows you what Electricity does. Fowler, the noted
phrenologist, says it's the instrumentality of all life.
Dr. Sanden'e Belt is a simple thing. You wear it about
three hours at night. You feel electricity going into your nerves
all the time. You can regulate it yourself ; turn it on mild or
strong. Every minute you soak up nerve power from it.
Even electricity is useless if not intelligently applied. Dr.
Sanden has devoted twenty years to close study of the nerve and
sexual forces, and even if other belts fail his treatment will cure.
Cheap, clumsily m<tde electric belts are like cheap jewelry.
You think you are getting a high-class article at a low price, but
your experience tells you that you pay twice for what you get.
â¢'I boueh! your Belt January 3 and have used it just a month. Previous to that time I was
so weak that 1 could not work. I commenced to gain in health and strength Immediately
upon application of the Belt, and to-day I ran attend to my business and take my station in
life like a man.. 1 owe it all to your Belt, and take pleasure in recommending it."
C. C. HELTMAN, Santa Barbara, Cal.

Passed His Evenings

Ex-Clerk William Peters of the
Oakwood Tells His Little
Tale.
LILLIAN'S MIDNIGHT RIDES.
Returned to the Hotel Alone in a
Cart at Two O'clock in the
Morning.
The Ashiey-Baldwin trial entered upon
its sixth week yesterday in Judge Slack's
courtroom. William Peters, formerly the
clerk of Lawrence's Oakwood Hotel, was j
the only new witness examined. Much of
his testimony, which was in general a rep
etition of what Lawrence had said, was
uninteresting, consisting of a description
of the arrangement of the rooms of the
hotel. His memory was not so good as j
Lawrence's, and in one instance he contra- j
dieted his employer's testimony. Law- j
rence had said that after Baldwin's daugh- J
ter, Mrs. Harold, had found Mis 3 Ashley !
and Falvey together she said she had
"driven them in." Peters was quite posi- j
tive she did not say this.
The famous poker games at the Oakwood
were described at some length by the ex
clerk. Baldwin and his friends, according
10 Peters, used to play steadily, sometimes '.
for seven hours in one night. Even the !
ladies took a hand with "Lucky" at the ;
game, but only in the daytime.
William Peters, who now lives in East
Oakland and is a clerk in the Southern
Pacific Company, was put on the stand, j
In the curly part of* 1893 he was
a clerk at Lawrence's Tallac and i
Oakwood hotels. He had seen Miss
Ashley and been introduced to her
by Mr. Lawrence several days after her |
arrival at the Oakwood. Lawrence had
also introduced her to his sister and Mr.
Baldwin. Peters had never seen Miss
Ashley and Baldwin together except on ;
the croquet grounds.
Peters corroborated much that Hotel- '
keeper Lawrence had testified to. He had
seen Miss Ashley go outriding, sometimes
with her brother and sometimes alone. !
Often she returned with Falvey in his
carriage and her brother brought her horse
back. Tne witness had never seen her
riding alone with anybody but Mr. Falvey.
He remembered that Miss Ashley bad
left the hotel alone one night about 8 1
o'clock in a cart and had returned about 1 ;
or 2 o'clock also alone. During the even- ;
ing her brother was at the hotel and felt
quite baa about his sister being out so ,
late. Peters remembered that Falvey was :
absent from the hotel that evening.
On the evening when Mrs. Harold had 1
found Faivey and Miss Ashley together : (
on the upper veranda of the hotel Peters ,
had seen them coming together out of j
Miss Ashley's room. They then went
downstairs into the sitting-room.
On cross-examination Mr. Crittenden I
went into the details of Peters' family
history.
He was born at Carson City in 1865,
und lived there until about 1870. For the
next fifteen years he had lived ran of the
time at Carson and part at Tahoe. From ;
ISB6 to ISS9 he was in a grocery -store at
Tahoe City. He had been Lawrence's
clerk at the Tallac and Oakwood hotels
from 1639 to 1893 at a salary of $50 a month.
Tnen he came to this CiV and worked as
night clerk at the Baldwin for four or five
months, leaving to accept a position in the :
Southern Pacinc Company at the Oakland !
mole.
Ex-Clerk Peters gave an account of the
famous poker games that Baldwin and
his friends engaged in at the Oakwood.
They played poker about five nights a
week, and the games generally lasted
from 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening to 2 or 3 ;
in the morning. Peters, who acted as ;
barkeeper, took in drinks to the players
ten or a dozen times during the evening.
Ladies also played cards at the hotel, but
never played poker at night. They played â 
whist. Sometimes during the day* how
ever, the ladies played poker with Baldwin !
and his friends.
The witness did not know whether there ;
was a $5, $20, $50. or any limit in the poker
games at the hotel. He knew the game j
well from having seen it played so often,
but declared that he had never played
poker himself.
When the cross-examination was con
tinued in the afternoon Mr. Crittenden
questioned the witness about trie arrange- I
ment of tho rooms at the Oakwood Hotel, j
Peters drew a diagram of the upper floor
and held an inaudible conversation with !
Mr. Crittenden over his drawing, much |
to the discomfiture of the court stenog- j
rapher.
Peters had not reported to Lawrence the ;
fact that he had seen Falvey and Miss
Ashley come out of the latter's room to
gether. He understood the two were |
engaged, so he thought nothing of it. He â 
never asked either party whether tney
' were engaged to each other, but he had I
"joshed 1 ' Falvey about it. The "joshing"
had not been at the request of Baldwin or
anybody else, but in imitation of Hotel
keeper Lawrence.
Mr. Highton again took the witness.
Before he commenced his re-direct examin
ation he bad Peters draw a plan of the
ground floor of the hotel. Another unin
telligible conversation over the drawing
between Attorney Highton and the wit- |
ness drove the stenographer almost to
distraction. ' , ,
When at length Clerk Peters was allowed
to depart Attorney Highton announced
that he would read the depositions of H. j
Li. Chamblin and R. Y. Harline. In an
swer to Mr. Crittenden's objections to the |
admission of the affidavits Attorney
Highton cited a formidable number of ;
cases to support his case. _
Chamblin in his deposition said, in ref- ,
erence to his acquaintance with Miss Ash- j
ley:
'Her first letter said that the had seen a no
tice of my place In a turf paper and that she
had long been anxious to correspond with a
wealthy (Southern bachelor: I to.d her in an-
Fwer that I was not wealthy and did not nil i
the Mil. Her second letter was simply to
thank me for my letter. Some time after that !
she wrote me a third letter from Boston, say- j
ing she had been thrown from a horse arid 1
badly Injured. That was about the last letter ,
I received from ner.
In answer to another interrogatory'
Chamblin deposed:
J met her. as above stated, about one or two
miles from Richmond on the road to my farm.
Hie first told me she was on her way to my ,
place to pay me r short visit, if it was agree- ,
able to me, I told her positively that she must
not go to my place. I picked her up in my
cart and drove her back to the streetcar line
in Manchester, Va., and was in her company |
only ten or fifteen minutes.
In answer to a cross-interrogatory
Chamblin further deposed:
About Fix months ago I received a letter j
from the Mr. Hardin previously mentioned in
my answers herein, In which he said that he
had gor into some trouble with Lillian A. Ash
-1 â â¢>-. and asked me if I had any letters sne had
written to me, please send them to iiiia. I re
olied that I did not have any of her letters in
my possession.
The deposition of Clerk Nellie 1. Ben
nett of the Westminster Hotel, Los An
celes, -was read by Attorney Hiehton.
Much of the deposition, being based upon
the hotel records, was stricken out upon
Attorney Crittenden's request. Clerk i
Bennett swore that Miss Ashley had paid
her hotel bill herself.
The commotion going on downstairs in j
the Receiving Hospital by the arrival of |
victims of the Fifth-street accident inter- I
fered somewhat with the prevailing quiet
in the courtroom. Clerk, bailiff and coun
sel kept going in and out, but Attorneys
Crittenden and Highton continued to read
the depositions, make objections and take I
exceptions. The depositions were jum- |
bled and mixed up to suoh an extent that 1
Judge Slack remarked that they had been j
taken in a very slovenly manner.
Detective Wood was recalled to answer
a question by Mr. Crittenden. He
testiliod tnat after his meeting with Bald
win about August 3 or 4 he did not see
him again until the fall of that year when
he met Baldwin at Sheepshead Bay.
Wood was not questioned further and
the court adjourned until 11 o'clock
this morning. Mr. Highton announced
that he would call only one or two more
witnesses, bo the prospects are that the
trial may come to a close by the end of
the week.
CHASED WITH A KNIFE.
Edward Fogarty Gets Thirty Days for
Disturbing the Peace.
Edward Fogarty, 124 years of age, was
sent to the County Jail yesterday for
thirty days by Judge Conlan on the
charge of disturbing the peace.
Fogarty, who lives on Nineteenth street,
near Castro, went home Friday evening
under the influence of drink. He got
ugly and chased his younger brother out
of the house with a batcher knife. Then
he attacked his mother, and a passer-by
ran to her assistance and struck Fogarty
with his cane. Fogarty released his hold
of his mother and made a slash with ihs
butcher knife at the gentleman, cutting
throueh his coat and vest. The gentle
man ran, pursued by Fogarty.
While tne excitement was at its height
Corporal Gleason, who lives in the neigh
borhood, app?ared upon the scene and
arrested Fogarty. The gentleman who
went to the lady's assistance could not be
found, so a charge of disturbing the peace
was entered acainst Fojrarty.
LOS T ON A TECHNICALITY
E. T. Steen's Claim for Nearly
a Half Million of
Dollars.
Judge Seawell Was Reluctant to Decide
as He Did, but Had No
Recourse.
Judge Seawell yesterday decided that
the claim of E. T. Steen, for $465,000, filed
against the estate of Joshua Hendy in
1892, xnust be decided against the plaintiff,
because it Is not supported by affidavit, as
required by section 1494 of the Civil Code.
The suit was first brought by J. \V.
Faulkner, assignee of Steen, but at tho
trial Steen was substituted as plaintiff.
Hendy died in 1391. In 1573 Steen and
Hendy entered into a verbal partnership.
Steen was engaged in tne purchase of
second-hand machinery and Hendy kept
the books. At the request of Steen the
partnership was dissolved in 1881, but no
accounting was ever made.
Judge Seawell, in dismissing the caÂ«e,
said that he did so with sincere reeret, but
"that, as the claim of the plaintiff was not
presented to the executors of Hendy, 83
â equired by law," he was "compelled to
rive judgment against the plaintiff on this
technical ground."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 23, 1896.
YOUR WEAK SPOT.
If You Do Not Know Where It is You
Should Find Out and Strengthen It.
Where is the weak spot in your system ?
Is it a weakness of the gtomach wiiich causes
Indigestion, dyspepsia, biliousness, constipa
tion, headaches and backaches, or is it a gen
eral weakness which makes you sufl'er from
tired, languid feelings ?
Wherever or whatever your particular weak
ness may be you can it you will get rid of it
and replace it with health, strength and vigor.
Do you know how ? If not you can profitably
read the following opinions on the subject and
get some valuable information.
Mrs. M. McMahon of 1 Sumpter street, Brook
lyn, says: "I vns formerly much troubled
with indigestion, but have been entirely cured
by using Duffy's pure malt whisKy, which I
can sincerely recommend. It g-ave me relief
â when all other remedies failed. I am still
using it and feel the benefit of it."
Mrs. J. \N'. Connor of Fitchburg, Mass., says:
"1 was in bad health and feeling very misera
ble and low-spi-ited when a friend jtdvised mo
to try Duffy's pure malt whisky. I did so,
and am now feeling stronger, happier and
healthier thÃn I have felt in years. It ha 3
worked wondors in my case."
Hundreds of similar opinions could be fur
nished, but the above are quite sufficient to
prove that Daffy's pure malt whisky is un
eqtialed for its stimulating, strengthening ef
fects. Wherever it is taken it searches out the
weak spots in the system and replaces weak
ness with strength. It purifies and quietens
the blood, promotes digestion and makes
sound, healthy flesh. It should be remem
bered, however, that it is not an ordinary
whisky, but is unlike any other. On this ac
count be sure and get only the genuine, and
accept no iufcrior imitation.

Explanation.
Tb" arrow flies with thÂ« wind. The top figure*
at station indicate maximum temperature for thÂ«
lays; those underneath it. If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredth*,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect point* of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interioi
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coa->t, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in 'hÂ» v:c nity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may he expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

CHICAGO M \KKKI >
CHICAGO, Hi, June 22.â Wheat starter! in the
week with rather a depressed feeling, opening
prices this morning being from %c to s /tl c lower
than those ruling at the close on Saturday. Hold
ers were far from feeling enthusiastic when they
heard that the world's shipments last week aggre
gated H. 400,001) bushels. When that, statement
and the fine weather, with heavy Northwestern
receipts, 546 cars against 51 last Monday and
196 a year ago. were considered, se'ling became
the order of the proceedings. The report of a de
crease in the amount on ocean passage of 3,200,000
bushels served to steady the lone and check the
decilne for a time, however.
Liverpool cables were steady. Chicago receipts
were 13 cars and Inspected out 8365 bushels. A
very moderate decrease in lhe visible supply,
667,000 bushels, caused renewed selling and fur
ther weakness. The English visible supply was
reported to have Increased 1,250,000 bushels, fix
port clearances were fair at 342.417 bushels.
Closing Continental cables were irr sjular. Septem
ber wheat opened from 6><Vic to 57 %c, sold be
tween 6HVi@543/ 8 c and 573'sC, closing at 57i /2 c,
iy c under Saturday. Estimated receipts for 10
--morrow 30 cars.
CORN Was not aroused from the lethargic
I sure S3 familiar to the trade in that market.
Price change* were regulated bÂ» the prevailing
j tone of wheat. Receipts were lighter than ex-
I pected, only 309 cars arriving. Withdrawals from
store amounted to 37,100 bushels and seaboard
clearances to 6784 bushwls. The amount on ocean
passage increased 80,000 bushels. Liverpool
cablrs were quiet and steady Danubian shipments
j of corn last week were 840,000 bushels. The
I visible supply decreased 36,000 bushels. Septem-
I her corn opened at 29VbC sold between 291/gfiti}
29 Vie and 28%(5> 2 cioslngat 29c, Vie under
Saturday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 575
cars.
OATSâ Nothing of an extraordinary character
was shown in the trade in this market to-day. But
slight interest was taken in a speculative way, and
alterations. In quotations came through the
strength $r weakness conveyed by wheat. Re
ceipts were 224 cars, and 91,989 bushels were
taken from store. The visible supply decreased
34,000 bushels^ Export clearances- were 64,292
busnels. September Oats cloied V 4@ 3 /gc lower.
Estimated receipts or to-morrow 600 cars.
FLAX- Was weak. Cash, 79y 2 <aÃoc; Sep

ceipts were 29 car*.
PROVISIONSâ Hogs in abundance arrived In
the y;.rds this morning, and conditions at that
place were reported as weak and almost demoral
ized. There could have been but one effect on
Dro.luct, and naturally prices weakened and de
clined. September pork and ribs each closed ac
lower, and September lard S@"V2C lower.
BUTTERâ Was quiet and steady to-day. Plenty
of stock was offered, but the demand was slow.

THEIR OWN PLAN
Unique System of Awarding
Bids for County-
Supplies
CAUSED A BIG ROW.
Some Bids, Apparently the Low
est, Were Really the
Highest.
FIGURES THAT TELL TALES.
A Pecu iar Method That Has Set
Merchants and Politicians
Wcnderlng.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, June 22. \
The Alameda County Supervisors have
devised a scheme for violating the law :e
--quiring all bids for public supplies to be
awarded to the lowest bidder. The system
is very clever, but it possesses the defect
of being illegal and will probably bring
about an open conflict between the Board
Â« i Trade and the Merchants' Exchange on
one hand and the Board of Supervisors on
the other. The work of to-day will prob
ably be undone and new bids asked.
This was contract day for the county
poorhou-e. The board room was made to
resemble a free market with scores of
samples of everything that the indigent
and sick eat, drink or wear in a charitably
inclined county. The space not occupied
with wares, food, drink, wood or coal was
lilled with warring contractors.
The profession of warrant-shaving is so
intimately connected with bidding for
count;. - that the board room al
ways presents an interesting scene when
the privileges are being awarded. To-day
it was more interesting than ever. A new
method of making awards had been de
termined upon and it gave general dis
satisfaction. The man who had given the
new rule most attention was Joseph
ilerrscher of San Leandro, and nearly all
his bids were lowest. Joe ran for County
Treasurer two years ago and was defeated,
but he was recognized en all sides as "the
best thing' 1 on the Republican ticket.
When groceries were called for, Herrscn
er"s bid, under the unique system adopted,
was the lowest, and there "was a protest
from other bidders. Supervisor Church
was impatient to let Herrscher get the bid
and made a motion that it be awarded to
him, even Lefore the samples were in
spected. There was such a murmur of
discontent that Church withdrew his
motion. Church then had the clerk read
the clauses of the new system seriatim,'
and as each one was read Church asked
defiantly, "Any objection?' Nona was
made, but when the totals were asked for j
there was a surprise, a flutter and general j
utterance of expression. Herrscher's total j
bid was ?7 ( J74, and Phelan ifc Fish bid !
$5643 for the same amount, yet under the [
patent â¢â unit system' of the Supervisors;
Herrscher's bid was the lowest.
This brought down Mr. Fish, who is ex-
Lent of the Merchants' Exchange, 1
and whe:i he made an analysis of the bids ;
he expressed himself very definitely. The
Other bids for coal, clothing, etc., were
taken up and the heat of the arguments
increased. Everybody voted that the
"unit system" was no good for legitimate
competition.
As an instar.ee of how the "unit system
is worked the following figures will show:
One man bids $4 50 a barrel for flour, ?1
a barrel for mackerel, $1 a dozen for 'â 
brooms and 7 cents a pound for sugar.
The amount for the unit of each is added
i:p and his bid is read out by the clerk
as $6 57.
Another man bids $3 a barrel for flour.
$5 for mackerel, $5 for brooms and 6 cents j
for sugar. His bid is read out as $13 06.
If the supplies needed were 100 barrels j
of sugar, no mackerel (which is said to be ;
t tie case), one dozen brooms, and 20,000 ;
pounds of suear the "'oweit" bidder's bill ;
would be $2551 and the highest bidder's
$1565.
When the clothing was on exhibition
the excitement got beyond the control of
the officials and they adjourned for a con
ference. Assistant' District Attorney
Cnureh arid his chief were called into con- .
sultation.
When the board reconvened the bids of
b Herrscher for groceries and dry
eoodÂ« were thrown out, although Church
and Peiouze voted for them.
Attorney Nusbaumer on behalf of Mr.
Herrscherentered a protest against such
;. as his client had complied with all
the requirements of the board.
GO SEARCHING FOR GOLD
Four Young Iron-Workers Bound
for the Feather
River.
Build a Raft for a Eo^t and a Thresh.
ing Machine Engine for Motive
Pcwer.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 22.â The four
young fortune-seekers who started from
West Berkeley last week for Feather
River on a raft and whose rudely con
structed craft sank to the bottom of the bay
before they Rot out of hearing distance
are not daunted, but are determined to
yet gather the glittering grains from the
gravel of the river bottom for which they
started. They have righted their scow and
rai.Â«ed their threÂ»hin--machine engine
from the deep mud and are again at work
:;. iikin^ ready for their expedition after
the golden metal.
These lour young adventurers, James
McFeelv, Henry Wilkie, K. Basil and D.
Beck, ranging in age from I<3 to 26, were
formerly â¢ inpioyed bytheJndson Manu
faoturiDg Company, and. catching the sold
fever about six "months ago, decided to
strike for the gravel beds of Feather River.
They ai once set to work building a cratt
which they considered suitable to their
I nrpose. A rude boat, after the mannerof j
a niu'lscow, was constructed, and on it was
ji acd a second-hand threshing-machine ,
engiae, with which it was intended to turn |
i ne huge paddle-wheel propeller which had
hen hastily itnprorised.
A cabin was built around the engine,
and at one end of the craft were their liv- \
ing apartment-. On the forward deck was
constructed an immense dredger, by the
use of which they expected to revolution- j
ize gravel mining. A stock of provisions j
;.) la*t many months was procured, and
everything was in readiness for putting off !
when us overtook them and their !
boat sank through i lie shifting of ttie >
engine. Their earnings for months pa-t
and the r'-sult of ball a year's labor h;id
all gone to the bottom.
After a desperate struggle they sue
j ceeded in eettinn both scow and engine
above water and are again at work pre- j
paring to scrape the bed of the Feather j
River for gol i dust. They are working
daily on the boat, which is moored in the
bay off Judson Iron Works. The embryo
| miners are reluctant about disclosing their
â  complete plans and merely that they
j propose making Feather "River or "bust."
"The Advocate" Progressive,
BERKELEY, Cal., June 22.â The state
ment, published on Sunday to the effect
that the Advocate office had suffered the
; peril of a strike Droves altogether mis
'< leading. Mrs. Marquardt, the able and
i courteous co-editor, stated yesterday that
in the rush of getting out a special edition
on Saturday it was arranged with the
comDositors that paying off be deferred
I until to-day. This seems to have been
| the soie foundation for the report. As a
! mailer of fact the very pro^ressiveness OI t
the A i vacate in issuing a special edition I
i seems to have occasioned the discrediting
story. All the staff of the Advocate re
pudiate me statement that they contem
plated a strike and are confident that the
i residents of Berkeley will De in no haste
to question the stability of their favorite,
progressive and reliable local paper.
Btt the Constable* Hand.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 22.â William
â  Nieman, a deputy constable in the em-
I ploy of the Southern Pacific Company, j
! while arresting two tramps at Adeline
j station this mornine for petty larceny,
i had nis right hand severely bitten by one
of them. The flesh on the inner part of
his member was lacerated to such an ex
j tent that the services of a physician were
| necessary. The prisoners were landed in
! the County Jail and a charge of mayhem
i placed against one of them.

A FLOATING BODY.
Bridge-Tender William Fottg f-ees a
Body Floating, but Falls to
Secure It.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 22.â William
Pfctts, the tender of the Webster-street
bridge over the estuary, says he saw a body
of a man float under the bridge at 6:30
o'clock this morning, but he failed to se
cure it. He says it -was the body of an
elderly man, lying face downward in the
water without a hat. The top of the head
was bald and on the back there was a
growth of grayish sandy hair.
According to Potts' story tha tide was
carrying the body away when he saw it, and
be being in a very frail craft was afraid it
would upset him if he started to tow it in.
After he got a better boat he failed to find
the corpse and declared that it sunk. He
rowed around for some time but cou'.d find
no trace of it. He thinks the clothes
caught upon a nail on the timoers of the
bridge and the tide sucked it downward.
CHINESE MAY RECOVER.
Murderously Assaulted by White Men
for the Sake of Securing
Opium.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 22.â The three
Chinamen who were murderously assault
ed by unknown white fiends Sunday night
on Oak street, are still alive at the Receiv
ing Hospital. Dr. Johnson gives hopes of
tneir ultimate recovery now, but it will
take some time for their wounds to heal.
It took him five hours to dress their
wounds.
One of them had fourteen knife cuts
dressed, all about the head and hands.
He refused to come to the hospital till this
mornine, and presented a pitiable sigiit.
! Another one of them had his windpipe
severed and barely saved his jugular
vein. The other one had his lung pene
; trated with the knife.
Detectives Holland and Williams have
good descriptions of the three white fiend*,
and have hopes of placing them behind
the bars shortly. They got $20 and a gold
watch from the Chinamen's cabin.

be present at the wedding. As told in to
day's dispatches, everything and every
body were present at the lovely Greenberg
home except the groom-elect. Search has
been made for Cohen to-day but no one
has been able to find him, and all sorts of
rumors are rife as to the cause of his ab
sence at such a critical time.
Cohen is an OaKland reporter- He has
worked on all the papers over here and
went East about three years aco, return
ing last fall. He is of a very affable nature
and is generally liked. His many ac
quaintances believe that he will turu up
and giv'- a goo>l account of himself, as it is
not at all in accordance with his usual be
havior to be ungallant to the ladies.
He was secretary of the baseball league
that went to pieces a few months ago and
has filled many transient positions, as
doorkeeper at the tabernacle and promoter
of public concerts.
A little incident occurred a few weeks
ago that has an added signilicance at t. is
time. The city editor of a local paper pub
lished a notice of the wedding and sarcas
tically concluded thus: ''The marriage
may take place June 21." Cohen was mad
wtien he saw the notice and visited the
office with the intention of having re
venge. Nobody was killed, however, and
the editor stated to-riay that he had prophe
sied more wisely than he had intended.
A brother of Miss Greenberg, the de
serted bride, has been in Oakland to-day
seeking Cohen and an explanation, but
has not found either.

ing t : â¦ . ur]inrtÂ« to be a representation of the seal of California. Nobody knows
who Â«iw.i> it, and on account of itn execrable appearance, viewed from an artistic
standpoint, no one will claim to bo the painter. It has hung at the bark of the
platform through religious and political meetings, but will soon have to go, as
the Exposition directors will not have the hideous thing in position at their
coining show. The drawing is frightful and the coloring is vile and yet the
canvas has been gazed at by tens of thousands of people. The accompanying
picture is a faithful copy of the painting. It will be observed that the face is
not nearly so broad as the arm.
Crowley divorce case was reached in court
this morning, instead of the findings beir.g
submitted in the form of a decree Mrs.
Crowley's attorneys, W. R. Davis and F.
L. Button, made a request that they be
allowed $230 additional fees for services
rendered.
This was strongly objected to by R. M.
Fitzgerald, counsel for the defendant, Dr.
Crowley, who contended that the estate
was small, that there had been no contest
and that counsel bad been detained in
court but half a day, and therefore $250
was sufficient for a fee.
After some further discussion the mat
ter went over until Wednesday morning,
when all interested can be present and

UNKNOWN SUICIDE.
A Stranger Shoots Himself on the
Steamer Piedmont and Diea in
the Hospital.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 22. â A man
about (50 years of age, having the appear
ance of being a Mexican or West Indian,
shot himself iv the head on the ferry-boat
Piedmont on her 11 o'clock trip from San
Francisco this morning and died from the
effects of the wound at the Receiving Hos
pital this afternoon at 3 o'clock.
He stood outside of the chain on the
! rear end of the boat, and evidently in
tended that his body should fall into the
bay and sink, for eech pocket of his over
coat was rilled with shot. But he fell in
the opposite direction, and was taken care
of by the deckhands, and, upon the arri
val of the boat at the long wharf, he was
sent to the Receiving Hospital. The bul
let entered his brain and caused uncon
sciousness from which he never recovered.
The revolver snapped twice before going
off. The boat was opposite Goat Island
when the tragedy occurred.
The only means for identification found
upon the suicide's person was a satchet of
j powder put up at Flint's pharmacy of this
city bearing the name of V. P. Smith,
Do'wnieville. Cal. He had been a sufferer
from jaundice, and ill health may have
caused the rash act.
BECAUSE SHE IS MARRIED
Mrs. Shockley Doubts the Ex
planation of Her Failure to
Be Re-elected.
Many Married Women Retained, but
She Was the Only One
Dropped.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 22. C
Mrs. Harriet B. Shockley, who was
I dropped from the roll of the teachers in
; t-e public schools a week ago without any
j explanation, is making an investiga
tion as to the reason for her non-election.
So far she has only been able to learn
that she was dropped because she was a
married woman, but so long as many
â  other married women are in the depart
j ment Mrs. Shockley does not believe that
was the reason.
The Oakland Board of Education elects
\ teachers every year in secret session. No
! one in the department is certain of more
! than a year of service, and there is great
' fear and trembling every time the first
j Monday in June comes around.
No reason is given when a teacher is
j dropped, and the members of the board
i say that the object of the secret session is
j to protect the reputations of the teachers,
j as a public discussion would be very an
' pleasant.
This explanation is the source of much
feeling on the part of teachers who fail of
re-election, as they naturally infer that
they are dropped because of some dere
liction of duty or incapacity. This is a
; very unpleasant experience for the teach
| ers, but there is no remedy.
Mrs. Shockley is not satisfied to let mat
ters rest. She has been attached to the
! department for some years. Last year a
I rule was introduced forbidding ihere-elec
! tion of any woman teacher who had a hus
: band living, but it failed of passage.
"I have been told by one School Direc
; tor," said Mrs. Shcckfey to-day, "that I
! was dropped because I am a married
i woman. This explanation would be a
good one if all the other married women
were dropped, but such is not the case. 1
am not satisfied with the manntr in which
I was dropped, and I propose to investi
gate and see what it all means."
Married or Xot?
OAKLAND, Cal.. June 22.â Mrs. D. D.
Baroteau, the divorced wife of Baron Ba
roteau, who was freed from matrimony a
week ago, reported to her friends to-day
that she had married Jack Troy. Mrs.
Baroteau i- 48 years old and Mr. Troy is
22. When seen this evening Mr. Troy de
nied that he was married, and there is no
record of any license having been issued
to the couple.
CURTIS V INDICATED.
Judge Wood I vidently Bolieves He

OAKLAND, Cal., June 22.â J udge Wood

Officer Curtis to-day when he denied the
motion for a new trial on behalf of Hen

conduct in summoning jurors.

FOR POLITICAL EQUALITY.
Woman Suffrage Has Not Dis
turbed the Marital Rela
tion in Colorado.
Lincoln Avenue Has Not Yet Been
Gained for the City â A Domes
tic Goes Wading.
ALAMEDA, Cal., June 22.â The regular
meeting of the Political Equality Society
was held this afternoon in Foresters' Hall,
the president, Mrs. E. L.Wood, in the chair.
After a few remarks by the Rev. S. A. Taft
Mrs. Hazlite, a resident of Colorado, ad
dressed the meeting.
She told her hearers that so far she had
not been able to perceive any change in
the condition of things generally since
women had been granted the franchise.
They experienced no difficulty in casting
their ballots and she had heard of no dis
sentions in married life caused by the
woman voting one way ana the husband
another. Indeed, the women see as well
as the men that their interests are identi
cal and the woman knows her interests
are bound up in his.
In speaking of the way women worked
to gain their freedom to vote Mrs. Hazlite
said the work was carried on on much the
same lines as are in use in this State. She
paid a hi^h tribute to the personal excel
lence of the miners of Colorado and cited
amusing instances of the way the would
be suffragists waylaid them as they came
off their shifts.
It was decided to hold the meetings
without any break or vacation time.
City Trustees.
ALAMEDA, Cal., June 22. â At the

June 26.
The City Attorney stated that in his
opinion no change of grade at the inter
section of Seventh street and Atlantic ave
nue could be made until a majority of the
frontage owners had presented a petition
askine such change to be made.
J. B. Pitchford, mechanical engineer, i
San Francisco, who drew the plans and |
specifications for the electric-light works, !
addressed the board on the lackness dis
played by him in their construction. He i
admitted that the work was not good, but I
bethought that was not his fault, as he
had a deputy to look alter the work. He
claimed the boilers were better set than
ni ne-tenths of the boilers in the State.
The Street Commissioners of Buena
Vista avenue were allowed $25 each for
extra services.
The ordinance prohibiting expectorating
i in public places or in public conveyances
! was carried.

OAKLAND, Cal., June 22.â The Rev.

declarations were adopted unanimously as
expressive of the party sentiment of this
vicinity:
The Younp Men's People's Party Club of
Alameda County stands aghast at tne assump
tion of certain members oi the National Com
mittee, under the chairmanship of H. E.
Tttubenech, with the tide of success settine
ton arcl our standard, t:> surrender the grand
principles of the People's party to the single
issue of free silver, and passing by vried and
true Populists to advise the acceptance of a
candidate fresh from the Republican party,
who repudiates being a Populist. While we
respect the honesty nnd manhood of Henry
M. Teller, we recognize in Senator M. V. Alien
of Nebraska a true Populist, sound upon the
silver issue and worthy of the supDort of the
rÂ»rty that he has so honored in the halls of
National legislation. We affirm our belief that
sincere friends of financial reform should rally
to the People's party, which declared for tree
silver in che Omaha platform, and is capable of
dealing with this as with every other great
issue before the American people.

MRS, CRAVEN THREATENED FOR CONTEMPT,
Refused to Be Sworn Be
fore Judge Slack Last
Evening.
MUST ANSWER TO-DAY.
Dramatic Bit of Play in the
Drama of the Fair
Will.
M'ENERY CRIES M FORGERY."
" I Will Not Stand It," Said Mrs.
Craven. " You Must." Said
the Lawyer.
In answer to the subpena served upon
them Mrs. Nettie R. I raven, her personal
attorney, Charles E. W illiams, and her
friend and adviser, Stephen Roberts, went
before Judge Slack last evening, and, after
ttie most interesting bit of play that has
yet trussed the stage in the great drama
ot the Fair will, retired again back into
the night.
Interesting as it was, it was still only
the usual piay before the court, resulting
in the everlasting postponement.
Mrs. Craven and the others were re
quired by the subpena to produce all the
documents that she may have irom the
hand of and affecting the estate of James
Ci. Fair. She did not do it.
Incidentally, in the argument against
her attorney's plea for time, she was
"roasted" without reservation. She was
charged with being a forger and the head
of a manufactory of spurious wills and
deeds.
This was by Garret McEnerney, done in
a manner quite unusual with him â his
inane shaking with the vehemence of his
utterance and his face growing very red.
Mrs. Craven became very much excited
ana, rising from her chair, her white kid
gloved hand raised to attract the attention
of the court, like a democratic delegate
fearful of being overlooked by the cha : .r,
she cried:
"Your Honor, this is too much! This
is unwarranted and outrageous!"
Mr. McEnerney took advantage of the
interruption to take a large drink of water,
then, setting down the glass, he looked
squarely at her as he said :
â Madam, you will have to stand it, and
much more of the same belore you are
tiirough."
Tne court said not a word.
The setting lor this rather strong bit of
action in the play was excellent. The
lamps were lighted, tne courtroom
crowded, very many ladies being present,
most of them the school iriends of Mrs.
Craven There was almost a full roster of
the attorneys in all the ramifications of j
the case who are in the City â Lloyd, Wil
son, Heggerty, McEnerney, Pierson, Sulli
van, Choynski, and all down the too
numerous-to-mention list.
Mrs. Craven held a conspicuous place a
htue away from the table between her
counsel, Choynski and Brittain. Near her
sut Williams and Roberts, wno were sab
venaed with her. She was dressed in
brown, with utce about her throat, a
jacket with big, white buttons and white
kid gloves.
Mr. Brittain, acting for D6lmas,who was
ill and. unabie to be present, made a strong
and indignant protest against Mr. Mc-
Enerney's statement. He declared that he
(McEnerney) would not have dared to say
such things had the senior counsel, Mr.
Delmas, been present.
But toe court refused to rebuke Mc-
Enerney. but promised to do so when it
(the court) deemed that he '(McEnerney)
was transgressing any of the legal pro
prieties.
However, the plea for time, based upon
the illness and absence of Mr. Delcaas, was
effective, despite the protest of the other
side that such a proceeding did not call
for counsel. The matter went over until
Wednesday evening.
Then the counsel for the petitioners, see
ing the game about to slip away for tne
time, readjusted themselves and moved
that the parties subpenaed be sworn. The
purpose of this was to bring them imme
diately under the jurisdiction ot the co urt.
And it was contested. For at least
seventeen hours the determination of it
was postponed.
M,r. u . Craven, when her name was called
to come forward and be sworn, llatiy re
fused. She said it politely enough, but
quite firmly: "Your Honor, acting under
the advice of counsel 1 refuse to be sworn."
She sat down in a tremble. Judge Slack
leaned forward and peered under the
lights at the sides of the bench.
â¢What is that?" he said, in something
like amazement.
Mra. Craven had it to say all over again.
She arose, took a step forward, and, plac
ing her white kid eJoves upon the back of
Mr. Choynski's chair, repeated as dis
tinctly as before, with a touch of tremolo
in her voice, "Acting under the advice of
counsel, your Honor, 1 refuse to be
sworn," she repeated.
Looking steadily at her and not at the
counsel his Honor said, very slowly :
"Then 1 will have to deem you in con
tempt of court."
"We shall insist that the witness be
eworn, " said Charles Heggerty, doggedly.
Mrs. Craven still refused. The court got
so lar as to fix tue time at twenty-four
hours that she should spend in jail.
F. & Brittain, acting for Mr. Delmas,
asked a suspension of sentence until at
least to-morrow at 2 o'clock â that is, to
day â and sentence was reserved until that
time, at which time was Mrs. Craven

stating that J. D. Sullivan. Levingston's
attorney in the Fair will matter, and D. M.
Delmas, the attorney for Mrs. Craven, were
too ill to appear in court, and that Samuel
M. Shortridge was out of town. He then
asked that the matter be continued. This
opened the battle.
Charles J. Heggerty, vigilant as a gen
eral momentarily expecting a surprise,
was on his feet in an instant. He claimed
that the proceedings were in the nature of
taking depositions, and that Delmas and
Shortridge were not attorneys of record,
bin simply of counsel. Then continuing
he aigued as follows:
"This is a very important matter. In
struments have been filed under s.uspicious
circumstances, affecting very large inter
ests of the Fair estate, and we desire to
have the persons who possess the knowl
edge of the facts give their testimony in
the matter. We propose to demonstrate,
before your Honor, that those documents
are forgeries, and we object to any contin
uance. We ask your Honor to direct the
witnesses to take the stand and subject
themselves to the authority of this court."
Choyniski objected to any further pro
ceedings on the ground that five days'
notice should have been given of the pro
posed taking of depositions, whereas the
subpenas were served at 4:30 p. M. Satur
day, he claimed.
The persons whose depositions were to
be taken, he added, had had no oppor
tunity to consult with their counsel, and
be concluded by remarking: "These peo
ple are here, and they have no intention of
going away.''
F. S. Brittain, chief clerk for Delmas &
Shortridge, speaking for his firm, stated
that Mr. Delmas was too ill to appear
and Mr. Shortridge was away. He repre
sented to the court that Mr. Delmas was
the only one sufficiently familiar with the
matter to handle it intelligently and
properly, and declared that the course of
trying to take the depositions under the
method proposed was wholly lauity.
He claimed that Judge Slack was not
sitting as a Judge, but simply as a notary
or commissioner, and that he had no more
jurisdiction than such persons. Mrs.
Craven, he said, was not in court in xe
spor.se to any order of the court, but sim
ply out of deference to it. He also asked
lor a continuance.
Heggerty opposed this motion on the
ground that witnesses were not entitled to
counsel. He suggested that if there were
any objections to the manner in which it
was proposed to take the depositions they
could be made when the depositions were
offered in evidence. He moved that Mrs.
Craven be asked to take the stand and be
sworn.
Brittain pleaded for Mrs. Craven again,
saying: "It haa been charged that cer
tain papers have been placed on record
and that they are forgeries. This is a mat
ter of the contest of Charles L. Fair in
the matter of the Fair estate, and we ask
that we be not compelled to go on with
the witnesses while proper council is not
here. The witnesses are not going away."
Here Heggerty renewed his motion that
Williams, Roberts and Mrs. Craven, all
of whom were present, be sworn. Dr.
Marc Levington, for whom a subpena had
also been issued, not having yet been
served. Williams demurred, stating lie
desired time and to have his attorney
present.
Brittain again objected, basing his stand
on what he termed the informality of the
proceedings and its lack of jurisdiction.
Heggerty came back quick as a dash on ;
.Brittain, declaring the situation was a
most anomalous one. "The court is a^kci
to grant a continuance," he said, "and
at tue same time is declared to have
no jurisdiction. I submit that these
proceedings are farcial. I find a gentle
man of the bar, like Mr. Williams,
saying that he wants time to investigate.
What? The testimony he shall give on
the facts that are within his knowledge?
Is that the proper proceeding? Why
should Mr. Williams and Mr. Roberts be
allowed time to prepare their story ?
"They came here with deeds and filed
them under suspicious circumstances. We
demand, as a matter of justice, to pave
them go on the stand and purge then;
selves"of what they know regarding them.
'"The court has no power to make this
continuance," he said, concluding. "Their
objections can be made when the deposi
tions are offered in evidence. That is the
extent of your Honors power at this
time."
Heggerty stated that Garrett Mclnerny,
who was at his side, was to be associated
with his firm in the Fair case, and he
asked that Mr. Mclnerny be heard in the
matter.
Mclnerny precipitated the first exciting
incident before be had delivered a dozen
sentences. He briefly referred to the re
cordiug of the two deeds on Friday and
then struck home, saying:
"These deeds," he declared, "are re
garded by all who are interested in the
Fair estate, myself included, as forgeries. 1 '
Brittain objects to tnis argument, but
Mclnerny went on:
''It has been charged in the public press
for months that Mrs. Craven had in her
possession forged deeds. These deeds
were filed for record last Friday, contrary
to the practice in this City for the past
thirty years, so as to make it impossible
for any one to see them and test their gen
uineness. We believe that they will be
proved to be forgeries.
"As soon as we learned that the evi
dence regarding them would simply be
the page in the record we began these pro
ceedings in order to place these deed 3in
the custody of the court.
"Mrs. Craven has refused to affirm or
deny she has a marriage contract with
Senator Fair.
"We want to show that she is at the
head of a manufacturing bureau here for
producing Senator Fair"s writings," he de
clared.
Like a flash Mrs. Craven was on her
feet. Rising to her full height in her in
dignation and scorn she faced the attor
ney and, pointing her finger at him,
shouted:
"I wont have it! I wont stand it!"
While he was being quieted by Brittain
and Choynski McEnerney calmly helped
himself to a glass of water, and remarked,
sottovoce: "You'll have to stand it." He
concluded by saying: "I state these facts
now to show that we should take the tes
timony of this lady with the greatest dis
patch."
Brittain attempted to take McEnerney to
task, but had only uttered the words:
"This unwarranted and unjustifiable at
tack," when Judge Slack interrupted him.
saying he had heard enough.
Judge Slack then said : "The question is,
Should the court proceed without the
presence of these attorneys? I am dis
posed to be reasonable, but shall not ex
tend the matter any longer than to
Wednesday to give counsel time to pre
pare. But before doing so I will ask that
the witnesses be sworn."
This was the crucial point. To take the
oath waj to admit the jurisdiction of the
court and to clear the road for the exami
nation of Mrs. Craven and all her wit
nesses in reference to the two deeds and
all other documents of the late Senator
Fair s writings in the possession of any or
ail of them.
Hardly were the words out of Judge
Slack's mouth when Heggerty was to the
front. "Mrs. Craven, will you please take
the stand ?" he asked.
But that lady's attorneys were not
ready to give up the battle.
"\Ve submit, your Honor," said Brit
tain, "has no power to order the witness
to be sworn."
Choynski also entered an objection on
the ground that the affidavit, which was
the oasis of the order of the court, did not
contain sufficient evidence.
At this juncture Mrs. Craven created a
mild sensation. Rising and addressing
the court she said, "I will not be sworn,
under advice of my counsel," she re
marked, as if she were declining a favor at
the hands of the court.
Attorney Williams was called to the
stand, and after some ineffectual objec
tions was duiy sworn. He was then in
structed to appear at 7:30 p. m. on Wednes
day with all the papers in his possession
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 23, 1896.
! that were defined in the order of the j
court. He promised to be on hand and to i
comply with the court's order.
Roberts also passed the ordeal without
further objection.
Again Mrs. Craven was requested to
take the stand, and agaiu, this time
quietly but lirmly. yet with a flush on her
lace, she arose and said: "I decline to be
sworn under advice of counsel."
Brittain challenged the right of the
| Judge to commit for contempt, claiming
j he was sitting as a notary, or commis
] sioner, and not as a Judge. He added
that if it became necessary they would
show that Mrs. Craven had not been
| served with the order of the court and
j came only in deference to his Honor.
Mclnerny asserted that a witness had no
â  right to question the jurisdiction of a
grand jury nor of any court.
Jtulge Slack addressed himself to the
contumacious witness: "Do you still de
cluie to be sworn?' he asked.
"If your Honor please, under advice of
council, I must decline," Mrs. Craven an
swered.
There was apparently no feeling on the
! part of either the Judge or the witness.
! The court then instructed the clerk to
I enter an order adjudging Mrs. Craven
i guilty of contempt and sentencing her to
twenty-four hours in jail.
The sentence of imprisonment reao,
> "Until she submits herself to the court
i and is willing to be sworn."
The suggestion was made by Mclnerny
| that the matter go over until to-morrow,
| so as to give Mrs. Craven a chance to
I apt>ear with the papers.
Brittain said the advice had been given
his client after due deliberation, and not
on the spur of the moment, and asked that
a stay of ttie sentence be granted and an
order first made that the witness show
cause why she should not be punished for
contempt.
Mclnerny objected to any stay on these
grounds, but agreed to allow a stay until 2
o'clock this afternoon to give Mrs. Craven
a chance to change her mind, provided
Mrs. Craven would agree to be in court at
that time.
"She certainly will be here," answered
Mr. Brittain, who turned to his client and
! in hearing and in sight of the whole court
informed his client of the proposed ar
rangement. The order for her to appear
to-day at the hour stated was made and
! the court adjourned.
Actions in ejectment were begun yester
day in behalf of Mrs. Craven for the Pine
street property, southwest corner of Pine
l and Sansome, and the Mission-street prop
erty, corner of Eleventh and Mission.
The rents of both properties are cited as
returning $5000 a month, and a claim ot
! $10,000 and $100,000 for back and accrued
; rents in both cases is asked for.
CRITICIZE LAX METHODS.
Receiver Sheehan and Attorney
Watt Blamed for Neg
ligence.
Five Huudred Dollars a Month and
Perqu sites Collected by
the Attorney.
Judge Seawell resumed the hearing of
the case of the People against the officers j
of the People's Home Savings Bank yes- i
terday. General John F. Sheehan was on ,
j the stand all day.
General Sbeehan was asked if he did not
. know, when he assumed charge of the
[ bank's affairs, that large blocks of stock
; were being transferred to insolvent per
j sons with a view of escaping responsi
bility. He replied that he only knew of
â  sxich actions in a generai way from reading
: casually the reports in the papers of the |
j Bank Commissioners' doings.
An inkling of the slipshod manner in
I which the bank's business was conducted
I was given in Generel Sheehan's testimony
, regarding its relations with James Alva
Watt, the attorney of the institution. It
j seems that $suo per month was thought to
! be about the amount of money that would
1 repay Watt for his services to the bank,
| and, in addition to this, the attorney was
j in the habit of bringing in bills for addi
! tional compensation.
The books of the bank show where, in
S addition to tbe regular $500 per month,
! Watt received, in December, 1894, $!*SO,
j and on another occasion $700, besides
- smaller amounts. General otieehan al
â  lowed all these bills because he had faith in
1 Watt as the bank's attorney, and did not
think he would bring in an unjust bill.
Watt's bill was based on the ground that
the service was for the benefit of the bank.
On one occasion Attorney Durst was
paid $150, although the sum total of his
services appears to have been to appear as
a substitute for Mr. Watt.
An item of $55 was allowed to Mr. Watt
I for typewriting done by Mr. Hardee, his
' stenographer, and was paid by the bans.
j The trust company peopie contend that
I Mr. Watt should have paid his own type
! writing bills out of the $.500 per month he
, received.
The litigation between the People's
i Bank and the Kansas Real Estate and
| Improvement Company was also gone
| into. The bank won this case and was
given judgment for the face of its claim,
interest and counsel fees. All this was
paid, including $500 counsel fees. It de
veloped, however, that but $250 of this was
! paid Mr. Watt by the bank, the other $250
being received by him from the Kansas j
company. I', is claimed that Watt should |
| have turned this $250 in to the bank, but
j that through the negligence of the offi
i cials he was allowed to retain it.
Genei^l Sheehan was still on the stand
i when court adjourned for the day.
SHOPLIFTER ARRESTED.
Maggie Mitchell Detected Stealing

Maggie Mitchell, an alleged profes

the East, was arrested last evening by
Special Officers Green and Allen while she
was plying her trade in the Emporium.

WILL MARRY A
FORMER PUPIL,
A Pretty Romance of the
Public School De
partment.
CAUGHT HER TEACHER.
The Patience of Vice-Principal
Kingsbury Rewarded
at Last.
WAITED TWO LONG YEARS.
A Wedding to Take Place To-Night
at the CeDtral Methcdist Epis
copal Church.
A wedding that will take place this
evening at the Central Methodist Episco
pal Church on Mission street, near Sixth,
will bring to a happy termination the
prettiest romance that ever interested the
School Department of San Francisco.
The contracting parties are "Wiilurd deL.
Kingsbury, vice-principal of the John
Swett Grammar School, and Miss Clara
Jeanette Stanbridge, a former pupil of the
teacher.
Two years ago Mr. Kingsbury, who is
considered a remarkably bright tutor, was
vice-principal of the Franklin Grammar
School, on Eighth street, between Harri
son and Bryant, and as is custom
ary with vice-principals, taugnt the ninth
or highest grade of his school.
Among the young iadies under his
charge was Miss Stanbridge, a pretty girl
of sixteen summers, who showed an apti
tude for her studies beyond her years, and
won the approbation of her teacher.
It was not long before a feeling stronger
than friendship and the admiration in
spired by a bright mind stirred in the
schoolmaster's breast, and though he
sought to stifle it and treat her simply as
her tutor and as he treated the other girls,
it would not down, but mastered him.
Try aa he would to conceal his teelings
the sharp-eyed damsels of his class saw
his si ate of mind, and it soon became a
matter of remark among them that Mr.
Kingsbury seemed to be very fond of
Clara Stanbridge. Ere long Mr. Kings
bury's affection for his fair pupil became
bo strong that he no longer tried to fight
against it, but allowed Cupid to lead him to
the home of his charmer, who lived with
her parents in a cozy residence at 31 Gar
den street.
To Miss Stanbridge's fatner, who ia con
nected with the Pacific Woodenware and
Cooperage Company, the smitten teacher
confided his affection for the daughter and
asked for her hand. Her parents, how
ever, deemed her too young to undertaice
the responsibilities of marriage and ask ed
him to wait a couple of yearn until she
had reached her eigh'eenth birthday.
Though impatient at delay Mr. Kings
bury consented to the long wait, consoled
with the thought that he could see and
talk with his charmer each day. Soon his
hopes were shattered, for he was trans
ferred to a similar position in the John
Swett Grammar School on McAllister
street, between Franklin ar.d Gough, that
he had held in the Franklin School.
The change involved a partial separa
tion, but there was no way out of it, and
Mr. Kingsbury went to live out nis two
years of exile from his fiancee's presence.
The period expired recently, and for
some weeks preparations for the wadding
have quietly been going on.
The bride will be attended during the
ceremony by a number of her former
schoolmates and pupils of Mr. Kingsbury,
and after the honeymoon journey the
couple will locate in a handsome residence
which Mr. Kingsbury has furnished for
his bride.
Vice-Principal Kingsbury is the teacher
who trained no little notice in the School
Department some years a^o by his inven
tion of a new system of teaching history,
geography and other studies.
He converted whole books into verse
and had his pupils commit them to mem
ory, believing that the minds of the young
people under his charge world retain
names and dates much better by that
method than by those generally in vogue.
Mr. Kingsbury is still a youns; man, being
about 30 years of age, and has been con
nected with the San Francisco School De
partment for some time.
A SCHOOL'S SAD CLIMAX,
Miss Lake's Celebrated Institu
tion Forced to Close Its
Doors.
Financial Depression of the Last Three
Years Said to Be the
Reason.
Miss Lake's school is doomed to obliv
ion. A sale will begin at the beautiful
structure on the corner of Sutter and Octa
via streets this morning.
The gymnasium fittings, the furniture,
paintings and bric-a-brac, and even the
ten pianos provided for the use of the
pupils are to be sacrificed to meet the
financial obligations incurred by the insti
tution.
For years Miss .Lake struggled for recog
nition in a small and inconvenient build
ing on Post street, with the result that her
labors placed the school on a plane which
made it the acme of every San Francisco's
girl's ambition to be graduated therefrom.
When the handsomely furnished build
ing on the corner of Sutter and Octavia
was erected, all believed that the school
had seen only the dawn of its prosperity.
This year twenty young ladies graduated
from ihe school and were accredited with
the university in ail branches.
The climax has now been reached. It is
a sad one. The dismantling of the build
ing which has been the abiding-place of
erudition will bring pain to many girls
and women who have spent happy hours
there. HF '
"The truth is," said Miss Lake yester
day, "l undertook too much. It was a
aeyere task to Kerp a preparatory anM
finishing school up to such a standard and
on snch a scale aa I wished. As I could
not lower the standard, all is over.
"For the past two years I have sup
ported the school I loved out of my own
private resources. They are now ex
hausted. I attribute the disaster to the
financial depiession of the last three years
and tbe gloomy outlook for the coming
year."
Miss Lake declares that she wishes no
vacation, nor has she any plans for the
future. All she knows, she says, is tnat
she must find some way in which to dis
pose of her energy as soon as possible.
COURT-MARTIALED.
Captain Warren of Thig City Charged
With Stuffing.
Captain Frank W. Warren of Company
H, First Regiment, National Guard of Cai
ifornia, was tried last night by a court
martial at the California Hotel.
The charge was that on the evening of
April 3, 1896, on the occasion of the an
nual muster of the company in this City,
Captain Warren was cognizant of the fact
that a man named Ratchford was in the
ranks and announced present for a man
named Corwin who was absent.
About fifteen witnesses were examined,
after which the court went into secret ses
sion to deliberate upon its verdict. Stiortiy
before midnight their deliberations were
concluded, but whatever their tindine may
be it will not be known until the testimony
shall have been printed in full and sub
scribed to by all the witnesses. Then the
president of the court will affix the verdict
and the decision will be published.
From what conld be gained by conversa
tion with individuals interested in the
progress of the trial there is not a very
strong probability that the accused will b*e
severely dealt with.
The court consisted of Major Juillard of
Santa Rosa, who presided, Major Hayes
of OaKland, Major Murphy of San Fran
cisco, Captain Elliott of Wan Rafael, Cap
tain Poulter of Oakland, Captain Part
ridge, the District Attorney of San Jose,
and Captain Boardman Jr. of San Fran
cisco.
Major D. S. Dorn of San Francisco acted
as judge advocate.
BURIAL OF REV. G, VINAY
The Missionary Who Was Dis

Now Regretted.

Omission" May Be Pardoned.
The Bereaved Family.
"He bore two years of grief and suffer
ing, passing calmly through the storm. He
gave what he could for God â his all; and
now he has fallen by the roadside. I knew
him well. We !.ad to face the same diffi
culties and sufferings and sustained one
another's courage."
It was thus Rev. E. Dupuy of the French
Reformed Church spoke at the funeral ser
vices of Rev. G. Vinay, which took place
The Late Kcv. Mr. Vinai.
yesterday afternoon in Bersaglleri Hail.
The San Francisco Presbytery was present
in a body, to bury the missionary, whom
exactly a week before it had dismissed
from its service. All the ministers who
made addresses alluded feelingly to the
courage and hich principles of the man
who lay in the casket before th em-
Two years ago the San Francisco Pres
bytery brought Rev. Mr. Vinay here from
an assured position in South Carolina to
undertake the Italian mission at North
Beach. When he arrived he found, to his
surprise, that there was no money in the
treasury, and the salary of $U>oo per
annum which he had been offered ha 3
since been paid with such irregularity that
he and his family have had to live for
mont.is at a time on credit.
On the 15th inst. the presbytery held a
meeting, at which it was resolved that
after July 1 the Italian work should be
discontinued, on account of lack of funds.
After the publication of the pastor's
condition in The Call he was visited by
different members of the presbytery and
everything was done to alleviate his con
dition, but it was too late. His sickness
changed to severe erysipelas and ho died
on Saturday ni^ht.
His sudden end has been a severe blow
to the presbytery. Rev. J. Cummings
Smith said yesterday: "The fundamental
fault lay in the presbytery undertaking
work which it could not afford. From the
first I have been opposed to the Italian
work on tliosf- grounds, but have always
been voted down. The Board of Home
Missions in New York should have con
tributed to Mr. Vimiy's salary, but the
board nas felt the financial stress severely
and has not sent the money regularly."
The funeral services in ISersaglieri Hall
were attended by all the prominent mem
bers of the presbytery in town. Around
the hall sat the late pastor's flock, many
of them unable to follow the services
through lack of knowledge of the English
language. The children from his Sunday
school stood about the door gazing won
derinely at the proceedings, and a choir
of French and Italian ladies, many of
whom were weeping, rendered the funeral
hymns. In the middle of the hall stood
the black casket, on the glass lid of which
some child had placed a little handful of
faded white flowers. There was also a
cross of sweet peas, and some old-fashioned
garden flowers had been heaped at the base
of the coffin.
Rev. P. Farrand, the moderator of the
presbytery, spoke of tbe missionary's
death as "One of those mysterious visita
tions to which we must submit." He
said that all present would be glad to tes
tify to their esteem for the dead brorher.
Rev. J. Jcnks of the First Church ex
pressed Christian resignation in a prayer.
He thanked God for the life and the brave
heroic death of the brother, and prayed,
"Pardon us for our omissions and our
sins of shortcoming."
Rev. J. Cummings Smith paid a high
tribute to the worth of the dpad mission
ary, and spoke of the splendid work he
had accomplished in South Carolina. Rev.
Eugene Dupuy made an address which
moved some people to tears. The services
were concluded at the grave in Odd Fel
lows' Cemetery.
The pall-bearers were: John Russell,
D. B. Lamperti, E. Courvoicier, F. Ca
pucetti, W. Pardini, A. Arogona.
The presbytery will be responsible for
the funeral expenses, and an effort is be
ing made to raise funds to send Mrs. Vinay
and her three children to Sicily immedi
ately.
The Enoch Talbot Libeled.
The State Harbor Commissioners filed a suit

STIFF VEEBAL PUNCHES.
McClatchy Entitled to a Jury
Trial Before an Impar
tial Judge.
PRESS DEFENSE ASSOCIATION.
The Congressman Believes That It
Should and Will Be Revived
at an Early Date,
The decision of Judge Catlin in the case
of Editor McClatchy of the Sacramento
Bee, charged with contempt of court in
having made severe strictures on certain
proceedings outside the presence of the
court, has aroused to action those citizens
who deem the freedom of the press again
threatened.
There is an almost unanimous opinion
that the old FYee Press Defense Associa
tion, called into action by the historic
Barry contempt case, should again be re
vived. Though not much has been openly
sairl up to date, the undercurrent of opin
ion is strong, and the association may
again, phoetiix-like, rite from its ashes and
do battle against the narrowness and illib
erality of the bench.
Congressman Maguire's name having
been mentioned for the presidency of the
rejuvenated association, he was seen yes
terday and asked to give his opinion on
the contempt case in question.
"My opinion has aiways been," he re
plied, "that the power of the court to pun
ish for contempt should be limited to
cases arising in the courtroom, or in the
immediate presence of the court during
its sessions, thereby interfering with its
procedure.
"I drafted the act which Judge Catlin
declared unconstitutional, and it expresses
exactly what my view of the law should
be.
"The power exercised by Judge Catlin in
the McClatchy case was not excercised for
the purpose of preventing the orderly pro
ceeding of his court from being inter
rupted or being interfered with in any
way. It was exercised for the purpose of
punishing the man whom he behevea had
been guilty of libeling him in his personal
and official character.
"Mr. McClatchy may have been guilty
of libeling Judge Catlin. I express no
opinion on that question. Indeed, I never
read the offending article.
"But Mr. McCiatchy was entitled on that
question to have his- guilt or innocence de
termined by a jury clothed with the
power of determining the law as well as
the fact. And, in my opinion, he was en
titled to have the trial proceed before an
impartial Jiulueâ not, at any rats, before
the Judge who charged him with libel.
"1 believe that the Free Press De
fense Association should now be revived.
I think that as long as any court claims
the power to punish a citizen summar
ily for the publication of a libel con
cerning the court or the Judge, all who be
lieve in the preservation of individual
rights, of freedom of speech and of the
press, and who know that 'eternal vigil
ance is the price ol liberty,' should organ
ize, and keep organized, until such
tyranny is made impossible."
"I have talked with others on this sub
ject, and tne general sentiment seems to
be in favor of reorganizing the Free Press
Defense Association."
KING BROUGHT TO TIME
The Supervisor From the First
Receives a Sudden Set
back.
Declared Out of Order and Forced to
Sit Down by Suprvisor
Dimond.
"This City has been robbed out of thou
sands of dollars," said Supervisor King
during the session of the Board of Super
visors yesterday, and this declaration,
coupled with other remarks, was the
means of getting the representative of the
First Ward into considerable hot water.
The board had previously sustained the
Mayor's veto to a number of ordinances
granting contracts to others than the low
est bidders for supplies for the City and
County Hospital. Toward the close of the
meeting Supervisor King offered a resolu
tion rescinding the action of the board
which gives the contract to the Pacific
Marine Supply Company, and made use
of the language quoted, adding that the
supply company offered bids on one thing
and delivered another.
About this time Supervisor Dimond, who
was in the chair, concluded that it was
time to take a hand.
"The gentleman from the First is out of
order," he announced.
"Out of order!" sputtered King; "I am
going to speak to my resolution."
"Sit down," ordered the chairman,
sharply.
King continued to arsrue. but his words
were drowned by thp hammering of the
chairman's gavel. Mr. Dimond announcing
that the business of the meeting would
proceed.
"But my motion" began King.
"Has been declared out of order,"
snapped the chairman. "The gentleman
from the First can appeal from the decision
of the chair."
"Haven't votes enough," said King,
glancing hopelessly about the assemblage',
and during the laugh tnat followed he sat
down abrubtly, too dazed by being forced
to yield to authority to make a further ar
gument.
To Quiet Title.
Nellie M. Connor has begun suit against
Charles McCarthy of the McCarthy Company,
the Stanford Heights Improvement Company
and other corporations and individuals to
quiet title to twenty lots to theLakeview Tract.
