No Sign of Telling the
Truth.

PARTNERSHIP WITH HOPKINS.
Peculiar Pretext for Selling Dividend-
Paying Stock for Nineteen Cents
on the Dollar.
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 6.â The
Senate Committee on Pacific Roads this
morning continued its hearings on mat
ters connected with the Pacific railway
debt?. John Rooney of New York pre
Â«ented for the consideration of the com
mittee the plan of the minority of the
bondholders of the Union Pacific for com
pel'ing a cash payment of the Pacific
railroad debts to the Government! first and
second mortgages), and to individual first
mortgaÃe bondholders by foreclosure and
reorganization, to be administered by Gov
ernment Commissioners, the privilege to
be conferred on junior bonds and stocks
of the present companies to retain their
interests by subscribing to the new issues
cf well-secured obligations, whose pro
ceeds are to be used in paying the first
mortgage and Government debts.
I'resident Hun tin cton's examination was
then resumed. Huntington said that he
had looked over the volume of the reports
of the Government Pacific Railroad Com
missioners, given him by Morean, and had
embodied in typewritten form his conclu
sions thereon, which he would give the
committee. He said the report generally
was wrong. It contained so many contra
dictory statements that he is convinced
the Commissioners did not know what they
were saying.
Morgan asked why Huntington, Stan
ford and others, who did know about mat
ters and were examined by the Govern
ment Commissioners, did not set the mat
ter straight.
Huntington replied that Stanford did
not know very rnucb about the business
affairs oi the road or their construction.
A- for himself he had endeavored to fur
nish all the information of which, he was
possessed.
Morgan then- took up the contract of the
Western Development Company for build
ing a portion of the Southern Pacific.
Upon receiving a non-committal reply to
one of his questions, he said: "Mr. Hunt
ington, it's no use trying to use the white
wash brush."
Asked if he bad not destroyed the pri
vate papers of Col ton, one of the share
holders in the Western Development Com
pany, fitter Colton had died, Huntington
replied very emphatically that he had not.
Mor^an inquired if Huntington had not
framed the contracts for building tne vari
ous sections of the Southern Pacific, and
tue latter said he supposed they were
drawn by Judge Sanderson, the company's
attorney. Hopkins had managed them,
Huntington thought, though tfcey were
nut done without the latter' s consent.
Morgan then endeavored to establish
the business relationship between Hunt
ington and Hopkins. They were partners
in the hardware business, Huntington as
serted, but not in railroad transactions.
The two enterprises were separate and
'listinct. the only connection being that
they might have loaned money to the rail
roads, just as any prosperous firm would
do. The hardware iirm had paid, he said,
about 12 per cent per annum for the
twenty years of the partnership. Mr.
Huntington would not acknowledge that
Mr. Hopkins had acted as Ins agent in the
various transactions with the railroads
and construction companies.
Morgan wished to know how much
money was taken out of the firm and
placed in the railroad business.
Huntington did not know. He was un
aole at this day, be said, to give the details
of a business of thirty years ago.
Senator Morgan, being unable to draw
anything from Huntington of a satisfac
tory nature, retorted to Huntington that
he appeared to know all about everything
in his own favor and nothing against him.
"Oil, no," replied Huntington. "I am
trying to eive Senator Morgan all the in
formation of which 1 am possessed."
While he was unable to state positively
Hnntington said whatever money was
drawn from the hardware and metai com
pany and placed in the railroad business
was charged to the individual account of
those drawing it, for that wa9 the only
business way in which it could have been
done. Hopkins was not, Huntington said,
a partner of his in the railway business.
When he died he had very little, if any, of
his (Huntington's) property in bis posses
sion.
Much of the cross-examination by Mor
gan bore upon the business interests of
Hopkins and Huntington, in an effort to
bring out their personal and business re
lations outside of the hardware and metal
company. Huntington said he had money,
real estate and merchandise, which he put
into the building of the Central Pacific
Kailroad. He could not say how much,
but it was considerable; always enough to
pay the debts when they came due.
Morgan pressed Huntington for a spe
cific answer, stating that generalities
would not do.
'â¢I want facts and you must give them,
said Morgan, somewhat irritated. "If you
do not intend to answer why don't you
6ay so?"
"I am doing the best I can, and you
must give me the credit of being honest in
my replies," replied Huntington.
Again Morgan pressed for a statement
as to how much money Huntington had
j.ut into the construction of the road that
was taken from his private purse. A apeci
The San Francisco Call.
tic answer was not given, but Huntington
said he furnisaed much of the money and
took the stocks or bonds of the company.
When he bought stock he paid for it, and
when he bought bonds he paid for them.
That was the only way money could be put
into the construction of a railroad.
"How much of this stock did you have ?"
"I had, I think, about 2000 shares."
'Did you pay np your subscription on
thestoci?"
"I should probably say that I did."
â¢'Did you?"
"I didn't pay for it personally, for I was
not there. I was in New York. I sup
pose, though, that the stock was paid for
in installments."
When asked if he got back the money
he paid in HuntinÂ«ton said he did not,
but that the contract company got some
property in the end, when everything was
cleared up.
Huntinjrton entered an emphatic denial
to Morgan's question whether the Con
tract and Finance Company was not capi
talized with the Central Pacific shares
Hu'itinnton held. That company, he said,
orsanized with money. Its capital stock
was $r>,000,000, but the organizers put in
more than that. Much of this money was
borrowed on the bonds of the Central Pa
cific.
In response to further questions Hunt
ington admitted that the money, or a por
tion of it at least, was borrowed on the
Government bonds until the company
could sell them.
"The General Government, then, and
not you," said Morgan, "put up the money.
You stocked the Finance and Contract
Company on the credit of the United
States. lam trying to find out how much
of your individual Juuds you or all of you
put in the construction of the Central Pa
cific road."
"We put in what could not be bought to
day for $5,000,000," said Huntington, "our
money and our time."
"But, " urged Morgan, "how much in
money of your private means did you put
in?" "
"I don't remember, but always enough
to pay its debts," was Huntington's reply ;
"but we could not have built the road with
out the aid of the first-mortgage bonds."
Huntington again took issue with the
report of the Pacific Railway Commis
sioners and declared that their conclu
sions were wrong. He did not know
where the Commissioners got their alleged
information, but wherever it was found
the conclusions were erroneous.
Reverting to the financial condition of
the road again Huntington said that no
dividends were declared until the road was
out of debt. The yearly dividends of the
road amounted to about 10 per cent.
Morgan asked Huntington why the com
pany did not take the 10 per cent divi
dends for a period of ten years and by
funding them in this way pay off the first
mortgage bonds.
Huntington denied that the 10 per cent
dividends extended over a period of ten
years. Later conditions caused a reduc
tion in the dividends.
"VVhy did you not?'' Morgan asked,
"pnt any dividends that were declared into
a sinking fund to pay off the Government
debt?"
Huntington replied that the stockhold
ers were entitled to the dividends. The
company wanted to fund enough of it in
this way so it could have paid the debt
when it fell due, but Congress would not
let them do that.
Morgan, pursuing >is line of examina
tion, asked if there i fere not enough divi
dends declared to jggregate a least two
thirds of the first mortgage on the Gov
ernment debt had they been funded.
Huntington replied that that would not
have been wise; the shareholder? were en
titled to their dividends. Huntington was
proceeding with an argument on this line
when Senator Morgan called a halt, saying
he did not care to hear a review of wit
ness' life.
â¢'I am not reviewing my life's history,"
retorted Humington. "I am perfectly sat
isfied with that, Senator Morgan. I have
been trying to tell you all I know. We
have just dore what the law required
through all this business."
"I should hate to state that if I were
you,'" retorted Senator Morgan.
The Finance and Contract Company
only sold its Central .Pacific stock, Hunt
ington said, when it began to appreciate
and for the purpose of paying its debts,
which amounted to between $9,000,000 and
112,000,000. Hnntington was proceeding
to describe the prices that Central Pacific
stock had brought at various times when
Senator Morgan suggested that the stock
might have been manipulated.
'â¢That stock has never been manipulated
and that is not a proper word to use,"
retorted Huntington, with some warmth.
"I'll use it just the same," replied Mor-
gan.
Huntington stated that he now held
probably something less than 6000 shares.
He had sold Central Pacific at 19 cents on
the dollar when it was paying a small
dividend.
In answer to further questions he de
clared that he bad not done so to break the
market, nor had he given instructions to
his broker to sell it as low as possible.
Upon a repetition of the question whether
he did not sell it in order to break the
market Huntington emphatically said he
never tried to bear the market.
"Then why did you sell dividend-paying
stock at 19 cents?" asked Morgan.
"To pay my debts."
â¢ "To whom were you in debt?" :
"To those from whom I had borrowed
money."
"And who were they?" - f
"Those who had let me have the money."
Morgan expressed his surprise at this
answer and Huntington said it was impos
sible for him at this day to say who might
have been creditors at that time.
The committee then took a recess until
to-morrow morning at 10:30 o'clock. , .

raded the streets shouting "Death to the

their disapproval of the attitude of the
United States on the Cuban question. The

had placed a strong guard in the streets
adjacent to the building, and the rioters
were thus prevented from approaching.
The crowd proceeded to the French con
sulate and cheered enthusiastically for
France, this action being due to the belief
that France would actively assist Spain in
the event of trouble with America. The
French Consul appeared on a balcony and
bowed his acknowledgments.
The reports of anti-Spanish manifesta

Daring One Encounter Thirteen Sol*

Rioters Are Injured.
ROME, Italy, March 6.â There was 8
renewal to-night of the riotous demonstra
tions here against the Government. The
mob smashed the windows of several
buildings and stoned the police. During
the melee revolvers were fired and thir
teen soldiers and policemen and two riot
ers were wounded.
At Pavia a mob tore up the railway, pre
venting the departure of trains. They
also cut a number of telegraph wires. The
rioters then proceeded to the Prefecture of
Police and smashed all the windows in the
building. The police fired into them and
it is reported that many were wounded.
The greatest excitement prevails every
where, and reports of disorders come in
from all directions.
Excited radical, socialist and Republi
can-socialist members of the Chamber of
Deputies were seen in Rome this evening
amid crowds of people crying, "Long live
Menelik!" "Long live anarchy!"
The socialist Deputies nave issued a
manifesto urging the people to insist upon
the Government recalling the troops from
Abyssinia and granting amnesty to those
persons imprisoned for taking part in the
recent socialist riots in Sicily.
The popular demonstration against the
Government which it was proposed to
hold to-night at the Capitol turned out to
be a complete fizzle. Only a small num
ber of people gathered in the Piazza Co
lonna, the place fixed for the assembly.
Later they marched to the Capitol, but the
police were present in force and would not
allow them to enter.
A number of Radical Deputies harangued
the crowd, eliciting howls of disapproval
against the Government's policy, but be
fore any overt act was committed the
police intervened, broke up the gathering
and dispersed the crowd.
General Baklisseri, the newly appointed
commander of the Italian forces in Abys
sinia, has arrived at Asmara.
The newspapers here publish long dis
patches giving the details of the recent
battle between the Italians and the Abys
sinians. The Tribuna says that, contrary
to the first reports, the unanimous testi
mony of the officers and askaris. or native
troops, is that the Italians fought boldly
throughout. They obeyed orders im
plicitly whenever they were well led.
The Italia Militaire says it is positively
known tbat General Dabormida is dead.
General Albertone fell wounded. General
Arimondi has not been heard of.
LONDON, Exg., March 6.â The Daily

who escaped from the recent slaughter in
flicted upon the army in Abyssinia took
refuge in Adigrat, which place is now be
sieged by the Abyssinians. The position
of the Italians is desperate. There is in
the town a supply of provisions sufficient
for only three days.
A dispatch to the Central News says that
215 Italian officers have reached Asmara.
A dispatch from Rome to the Central
News asserts that King Humbert has de

CJtISPI SOT AÂ»SASSIXATED.
Just the Usual Canard by the Chicago
Associated Press.
ROME, Italy, March 6.â Dispatches
were received here to-night from the
United States inquiring as to the truth or
falsity of a rumor that had been circu
lated, by the Chicago Associated Press to
tbe effect that Prime Minister Crispi had
been assassinated.
LiKe much of tbe alleged cable news of
that "enterprising" Western concern, the
rumor had no foundation in fact and
could have been disproved had the
slightest effort been made to ascertain
the facts.
Signor Crispi is enjoyine his usual
health, but is, of course, greatly harassed
by the troubles that have overthrown his
Cabinet.
That he is a much-hated man is gen
erally conceded, and this fact is the only
thing that adds the slightest air of prob
ability to the sensational and false story
furnished to a few American newspapers
by the Chicago Associated Press.
OF VERT GH4FJS IMPORT.
The Abyitinian Muddle Will Affect the
Triple Alliance.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 6.--A spe
cial cable to the Sun from London says :
Italy's defeat in the battle of Adua is re
garded now throughout Europe as an
event of. the first magnitude. It is be
lieved that its effect upon the political
situation of Europe will be of far-reaching
importance.
Already the dissolution of the triple
alliance is discussed in the principal cap
itals as it an accomplished fact. Some say
the old league of three emperorsâ German.
Russian and Austrian â will taJce its place;
others that Italy and France will become
friends again,
Still others affirm that if England fails
to go to the assistance of Kinsr Humbert
in this emergency British isolation soon
will become more uncomfortable than it
ever has been.
It is asserted persistently in Berlin,
Vienna and Rome that Germany and
Austria have given Italy peremptory ad
vice to abandon Abyssinia, and that King
Humbert has replied that he would abdi
cate his throne rather than comply.
There is good authority for saying that
Italy will within a few days test Great
Britain's friendship by endeavoring to
float a large loan with English assistance.
In fact, indications multiply hourly
almost that the regrouping of the powers,
which has been foreshadowed for several
months, is at length at hand. French
sympathy with Italy in her great mis
fortnne is remarkable.
It is accounted for partially by the down
fall of Crispi and by the fact that the im
pression prevails in France that Germany
and Anstria are inclined to throw over
board their uniortunate ally.
Russia in this, as in all other complica
tions of the last few months, is the only
power which regards the situation with
equanimity. It is scarcely worth while to
speculate in the dark what the result of
the great secret game will be, but all Eu
rope is again getting on tenterhooks.
The domestic condition of Italy is ex
tremely serious, but probably does not
justify the fears in some quarters that
King Humbert's throne is in danger.
There are many wild rumors afloat, bat
the situation is not yet desperate.

LONDON, Em., March 6.â The expected
Venezuelan blue book, which is entitled
"Documents and Correspondence Relating
to the Question of the Boundary of Guiana
and Venezuela," will be issued by the Gov
ernment to-night. The volume consists of
443 folio pages, with a separate portion
containing nine map*. The book opens
with forty pages, comprising a preliminary
statement dealing with the history of the
territories from 1520 until the issuance of
her Majesty's memorandum to Venezuela
in March, 1890. The book is divided into
historic periods, from the earliest time to
1648, from 1648 to 1796, and from 1796 to
1840. ALer that period references are)
made to various claims and dispatches,
and the report concludes with a brief
summary. The preliminary matter is
summarized as follows:
"The purpose of the present statement, 11
the book says, "is to explain a general out
line of the position of Great Britain in the
long-pending dispute with Venezuela as
regards the boundary between Briti3h
Guiana and that country. The territories
now known as British Guiana and Vene
zuela had been discovered before 1520.
Between the date of their discovery and
16-18 the Spaniards and the Dutch occupied
portions of this territory, the extent of
such occupation by each country coniinu
ing to be a matter of consideration."
In 1580 the united provinces of the
Netherlands threw off their allegiance to
the Spanish crown and war ensued, which
lasted almost uninterruptedly lor seventy
years. In January, 1648, peace was con*
eluded by the treaty of Mnnster, by which.
Spain acknowledged the independence of
the Netherlands, and the two countries, re
spectively, confirmed their then posses
sions on the South American continent.
From 1648 to 1796, with the exception of
the interval between 1781 and 1783, the
Dutch remained in possession of the terri
tory they had occupied prior to the treaty
of Munster, and extended their settle
ments within it.
In 1786 the territory now known as
British Guiana was acquired by Great
Britain. That acquisition was recog
nized and confirmed by a treaty con
cluded in 1314. In 1810 Venezuela re
volted, but her independent existence
apart from the United States of Colom
bia, by which she was for a time
merged, did not commence until 1830,
and was not formally recognized by
Spain until 1845. It is therefore held
that the following conclusions have been
clearly established:
Firstâ That prior to 1590 the Dutch had
established themselves on the coast of
Guiana.
Secondâ That prior to 1596 the Spaniards
had established no settlements in Guiana*
Thirdâ That by 1648 the Dutoh settle
ments in Guiana extended along the
coast the whole way from the Rivdr
Maronito the Barima, and inland to vari
ous points in the interior upon the rivers
Essequibo, Luyuni, Pomeroon, Waini and
Barima and their tributaries.
Fourthâ That up to 1723 the only settle
ment of Spaniards in Guiana was San
Thome de Guayana, on the south bans of
the Orinoco, originally founded in 1596 at
a site shown on the sketch-map.
Fifthâ That between 1723 and 1796, thÂ«
only additional settlements founded by
Spaniards in Guipna were those established
by the Capuchin missions south of the
Orinoco, in the direction of the River
Yuruan, and two villages on the upper
Orinoco, several hundred miles above San
Thome de Guayana.
Sixthâ That Dutch occupation to thd
extent above indicated was perfectly well
known in Spaiu, and that the attempts of
the Spanish to dispossess the Dutch had
wholly failed.
Seventhâ That subsequently to 1796,
Great Britain has continuously remained
in possession, and her subjects have oc
cupied further portions of the territory to
which the Dutch established their title.
"From the first settlements to 1648," the
report continues, "the Dutch appear to
have been the first. Early in the sixteenth
century they turned their attention to
Guiana, and there is abundant evidence
from Spanish sources that during the lat
ter half of the century, prior to 1590, the
Dutch established themselves on the coast
of Guiana. In 1595 the explorer Captain
Charles Leigh found the Dutch established
near the month of the Orinoco, a fact
which is confirmed from Spanish sources.
The first settlement by Spain in Guiana
was in 1596, when Antonio de la Hoz Berro
founded San Thome de Guyana on the
south bank of the Orinoco. A dispatch
from Rogue de Montes, Treasurer of Cu
mana, to the King of Spain, dated April,
1596, shows that the Spaniards did not
then bold any part of Guiana."
In the early part of the seventeenth
century the various companies which
were afterward merged into the great
West India Company were employed in
colonizing Guiana, and had established
several settlements there before 1614, and
the existence of these settlements was
officially reported to Spain. The follow
ing extracts from memoranda on Guiana,
which was deliberated upon by the Span
ish Privy Council, are dated 1614. They
say in regard to the Dutch settlements
then existing:
i "It is well clear that those coasts belong2
to them from the River Maranon to the
River Orinoco, and there are three or
four more settlements which are very
flourishing, and from which they derive
much utility and very good profit, with
the mouths of those two rivers, making
themselves masters of the possessions and
fruits of the natives."
These records show that the Dutch had
at this time firmly settled themselves
along the coast as far as the Orinoco. In
1621 a charter of the Dutch West India
Company, granted by the States-General
of Holland and reaffirmed in 1637, gave
the Orinoco as the limit of the company's
tenitoriaJ jurisdiction.
From secret reports on the dominions of
Spain in America, addressed to the Span
ish Government under a date of a few
years before the conclusion of the treaty of
Munster, it appears that the Dutch settle
ments extended from close to the Amazons
to the Orinoco. The whole of this is there
fore clear:
That prior to the date of the treaty of
Munster, the Dutch settlements, to the
knowledge of the Spanish Government,
extended on the coast as far as the Barima
and the Kiver Amacura. The treaty
concluded between Spain and the Nether
lands in January, 1648, continued the
Dutch in all the possessions they had ac
quired in South America and gave them
the liberty to make fresh acquisitions
wherever the Spaniards were not already
established.
At tbe date of that treaty Fpain had only
the settlement in Guiana San Thome de
Guyana. After the treaty of Munster
fresh negotiations were again issued by
the States-General to the Dutch West In
dia Company, in which the Orinoco was
again treated as the limit of Dutch juris
diction. From 1643 to 1796 the Dutch col
onies on the Essequibo, Pomeroon and
Morocco were reported as flourishing
greatly and attracting free immigration,
bidding fair to become the most flourish
ing of the tropical plantations in America.
About 1661 Fathers Llauri and Yercara
were sent to explore Guiana with a view to
seeing whether a Jesuit mi-sion should be
founded. They reported that the province
had been abandoned by the Spaniards.
In 1654 the Dutch commander at Es
sequibo recommended that a strong post
he established at Barima in place of a
small watchhouse. By 1700 posts were es
tablished by the Dutch at places along the
coast and in the interior. Three of the
latter posts are named in the records, one
being beyond the Cuyuni. In 1714 the
provisions of the treaty of Munster ex
pressly continued the treaty of Utrecht.
At that date Spain had no possession of
any territory in Guiana beyond part of the
right bank of the Orinoco. No Spanish
settlements or missions existed in any
other part of Guiana. The Dutch upon
the coast extended along the Orinoco into
the interior to the watersheds of the Es
sequibo, Cuyuni, Pomeroon and Amacura.
In 1830 the Dutch West India Company
by public notice prohibited trade on the
Rivers Massaguni and Cuyuni except to
its own agents. Between 1730 and 1790 a
number of Capuchin missions, established
by the Spaniards, were entirely confined
to the district between the Orinoco and
Yuruari. From reports made from time
to time by the director-general of the
Dutch colony it appears that about 1743
the Spaniards were attempting to encroach
on the Dutch territory in the neighbor
hood of the affluents of the Cuyuni.
Thereupon the director-general dispatched
an emissary to remonstrate with the Span
iards, who are reported to have replied
that the whole of America belonged to
Spain.
These attempts of the Spaniards to ex
tend their territory were entirely confined
to tne Cuyuni adjoining the district al
ready occupied by the Capuchin missions.
A report of the Spanish commandant of
Guiana states that in 1750 the Dutch were
in the interior on the Cuyuni and at the
mouth of the River Curumo, which flows
into said river.
Between 1750 and 1752 the Capuchin
fathers from the missions applied to the
Dutch Government for permission to trade
in Dutch Cuyuni. They were refused.
In i 755 the Dutch, in order to prevent en
croachments by the Spaniards on the terri
tory of Yuruay, which they considered in
disputably Dutch territory, established a
post 150 miles higher up the Cuyuni.
The position of this post is shown on the
the sketch map. The same year the Span
ish commandant on the Orinoco com
plained to the Dutch of disorders in
Barima, showing that the Dutch then had
jurisdiction there. In 1758, as appears
from a Spanish official report, a question
h aving arisen regarding the rights of fish
ing, the Dutch claimed that their domin
ion extended from the Ship's Mouth, or
grand mouth of the Orinoco, and that they
were entitled to fish in that part of the
river. From areportof Governor Cumana,
in 1761, to the King of Spain, it clearly
appears that, with the exception of the
Fort San Thome de Guayana and the mis
sions, the Spaniards had occupied terri
ritory on the right bank of the
Orinoco, and that the local Span
ish authorities had been engaged
in ineffectual attempts to induce the
Government to fortify the Orinoco at An
gostura so as to prevent the Dutch and
Caribs from ascending the river. The re
port gives the names that were then known
of sixteen villages or missions. Not one
of the missions was extended.
Coming to 1772 Spanish claims to the
greater part of Guiana are raised fca a re
port from the commandant of the prov
ince. An extract taken from the archives
of Indias proceeds to state that the boun
daries of this province and the Guayana
boundaries are: Bounded on the north by
t&e lower Orinoco; on the east by the At
lantic Ocean ; on the south by the Amazon
and on the west by the Rio Xegro, etc.
It is scarcely necessary to observe that
this claim included the whole Dutch set
tlements and French Guiana right down
to the Amazon River, an extent of terri
tory that Spain never attempted to occupy
or even claim, unless the pretension that
the whole of America belonged to the
Spanish kingdom by virtue of the papal
bulletin of 1496 can be regarded as a claim.
In 1781 the British captured Dutch
Guiana and marked the boundary upon
the coast to the westward of Point Barima.
A map of the newly acquired colony,
grafted on the spot and published in Lon
don in 1783, gives the name Barima to the
River Amacura and makes it the western
boundary of the colony. The colony was
restored to the Dutch in 1793 and again
captured by the English in lFJti. The Eng
lish then marked the boundaries again.
This summary of events conclusively
establishes that during the whole period
from 1648 to 1796 the Dutch had uninter
rupted possession of the entire coast line
from the river Correntin to Barima.
During the same period they explored
the upper portions of nearly all the rivers
to a considerable extent, and made settle
ments in the adjacent districts. Prior to
1783 there was no settlement by the Span
iards in the territory except at San Thome
de Guayana, which was originally situated
at about the spot indicated on the sketch
map, and twice subsequently removed far
ther up the river, and that between 1724
and 1796 the Capucnin missions, estab
lished south of the Orinoco, gradually ex
tended southward and eastward toward
tne Dutch territory, the farthest point
occupied by the Spaniards being the vil
lage of Tumeremo, founded about 1788.
Before 1796 Dutch settlements existed
far up the Cuyuni, while a Dutch fort was
established near Yuruari at about the spot
marked upon tbe sketch map. The Dutch
had full control of the whole basin of the
Cuyuni and with the exception of their
settlement at San Thome de Guayana and
the missions the Spaniards exercised no
authority nordominion whatever over the
territory now in dispute.
The third period, 1796 to 1840, opens with
a quotation from the report of Spanish
Commissioner Requena, in July, 1802.
After pointing out that the territory be
tween the Orinoco and Amazon rivers be
longs to Spain by riÂ«ht of discovery, he
proceeds to state that the coasts had been
abandoned by the Spaniards for more than
a century and that the Dutch and French
had founded colonies on them unopposed
by Spain.
He warned the Government that the
Dutch were advancing up the Essequibo
and might aavance from Cuyuni and
Caroni to the Orinoco and take possession
of the lower part of that river. This refer
ence to the position of the Dutch on the
Cuyuni is another of many instances
showing conclusively that their establish
ment on the Cuyuni was perfectly well
known to the Spaniards for many years
prior to 1802.
A report to the commander of the British
forces in the West Indies in 1802 shows
that the Spanish occupation was confined
almost exclusively to the northern banks
of the Orinoco. For about 130 miles from
Barima on the right bank there was no
existing Spanish settlement or occupation
of old Guiana. The original site of the
fort of San Thome de Guayana utill
remained unoccupied.
In 1810 a careful report of the condition
of Spanish Guiana sent by the Junta Supe
rior to the King fully confirms the pre
vious statements of the condition of Span
ish enterprise in the district. The report
states that the Governor never took a
single step tcward carrying out the design
to settle the lower part of the Orinoco, or
to establish a Spanish village with a fort
on the right bans.
In 1810 Venezuela declared her inde
pendence of the crown of Spain. In 1814
treaties were made between Great Britain
and the Netherlands. The colonies of
Essequibo, Demarara and Berbico were
retained by Great Britain.
Negotiations at the same time between
Great Britain and Spain resulted in a
treaty by which the Spanish Government
engaged that in the event of the commerce
of the Spanish American possessions be-
ing opened to foreign nations, British com
merce should be admitted to trade with
those possessions as a most favored nation.
Had any question existed of the right of
Spain to any portion of the territory, long
known as a Dutch colony, it would have
been raised then.
In 1817, General Bolivar, President of
Colombia, with which Venezuela was then
incorporated, issued an order from his
headquarters at Angostura, saying that
the Governor of Guayana must be consid
ered not only the Governor of the fort at
old Guayana. but also as military Governor
of the Orinoco to its mouth.
In 1927 an official report UDon the extent
and situation of the crown lands of the
colony gave the boundary of the colony
recognized at that date as follows: On
the north the seacoastfrom the mouth of
the river Abari to Cape Barima, near the
mouth of the Orinoco, and on the west, a
line running north and south from Cape
Barima into the interior.
In 1831, in the course o! an investigation
connected with certain trials for murder,
ibe jurisdiction of Great Britain bad to be
investigated. The evidence given clearly
established that grants of land had been
made for considerable distances uu the
Essequibo, Mas9aruni and Cuyuni rivers,
and that Dutch settlements and forts ex
tended still further along these rivers.
It was also shown that in the districts in
question the crown of Great Britain exer
cised all the rights by which nations usu
ally indicate claims over territorial posses
sions, and further, that there had been
continuous control over the Indians by
the British. About 1831 a report was
made by the agent of the colony to the
Lieu tenant-Govern or, describing the ef
fective control which had. been effected
over the Indians by the protectors and the
post-holders. These reports established
clearly that the Indian tribes inhabiting
the country in submission owed allegiance
to Great Britain. Durine this period
British missionaries from time to time
visited the various parts of the colonies,
and their reports show that the Spanish
frontier was at the head of the Cuyuni and
Massaruni rivers.
From the facts detailed in this chapter,
it is clearly established that Great Britain,
on becoming possessor of the colony, suc
ceeded to all the rights of the Dutch.
After 1796 Great Britain extended her
settlements and continuously exercised
over the territory originally claimed by
the Dutch all those rights by which na
tions usually indicate a claim of territory.
Neither Spain nor Venezuela, after the
latter's independence, had either posses
sion of or dominion over the territory in
question.
A part of the fourth period after 1840
opens with an explanation that the lirst
Schomburg map, in 1839, was not official,
but an actual line prepared on the com
mission's survey.
In 1840 and 1842 it came to the knowl
edge of the Government that six years
before correspondence bad passed between
the Venezuelan authorities and the British
Consul at Caracas in which the latter, at
the request of the British Vice-Consul at
Angostura, proposed to Venezuela that
they erect a beacon on Cape Barima in
order to guide ships in the neighborhood
of the Orinoco. This correspondence was
in no way authorized. The British Gov
ernment had no knowledge of it until it
was communicated to them. Venezuela
never returned a reply to the proposal.
This was a period of discussions. The first
overture was made by Venezuela in Janu
ary, 1841, when in reply the announce
ment was made of Scbomburg's official
appointment to survey the boundary and
a proposition made to negotiate a treaty
to define the territorial limits.
A desire was expressed by Venezuela
that the treaty negotiations should pre
cede the survey for the demarkation of the
frontier.
Later Venezuela remonstrated against
Schomburg's placing boundary posts at
certain points. The statement here refers
to Minister Fortique's remonstrance and
Lord Aberdeen's reply, resulting in the re
moval of Shomburg's posts. It quotes
Lord Aberdeen's declaration of January,
1842, that the removal of the posts must
not be understood as meaning that Great
Britain abandoned any portion of her
rights to the territory formerly held by
the Dutch. Iv 1843 Venezuela renewed
application for a speedy conclusion of a
treaty. â¢
Minister Fortique's note of January,
1844, presented the first formal statement
claiming that the territory of Venezuela
extended to the Essequibo. The main
grounds for the claim were that Spain
was the first discoverer and occupant of
the New World; that the Spaniards at an
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 7, 1896.
early date occupied and explored the
Orinoco and all the contiguous country on
the Barima, Morocco aud Pomeroon; that
at the time of the treaty of Munster the
Dutch had no possessions in Guiana, at
least on tbe northern and western side of
the Essequibo; that the Spanish dominion
extended as far as the Essequibo, and that
any possession of the Dutch westward of
the river was a usurpation unapproved
by Spain.
After giving a summary of Lord Aber
deen's reply to the preceding a historic
statement of the Dutch claims is quoted
as proof that Venezuela based her preten
sions upon allegations relative- to the
Spanish and Dutch occupants, and they
are conclusively proved erroneous. In
1875 Senor Calcano readvanced the claims
on the same grounds as those of Senor
Fortique, with the addition that the
former relied upon the bull of Pope Alex
ander VI as imparting fresh and most
valuable recognition, which at the time it
was issued had decisive significance.
Senor Calcano further alleged that the
Capuchins occupied the space between the
Orinoco, Cape Nassua, the sea and the
river Caroni. There is no trace of such
occupation.
The royal warrant of 1736 denning the
sphere of missionary enterprise in Guiana
has been quoted as authority for this state
ment. Reference to the original document
shows that it contains no words to justify
the assertion. The passage which has been
cited in support of the contention of Ven
ezuela is an interpolation. Senor Calcano
further quoted an article from the conven
tion of Aranjues making the surrender of
fugitive slaves effective between the Span
ish establishments on the Orinoco and
Essequibo, Demarara and Surinam, and
suggesting that Essequibo referred to the
river. This suggestion is unfounded. A
perusal of the convention shows clearly
that the words used are a well-known gen
eral description of the Dutch colony.
From this point the statement follows
the better known history of the diplo
matic negotiations between Vene
zuela and Lord Salisbury, Lord Gran
ville and Lord Rosebery, to the rup
ture of the diplomatic relations in 1887.
Alluding to the statement of the "Vene
zuelan claim in the note of Senor Urban ja
in January, 1887. the statement proceeds:
The main additional grounds then put
forward in support of the claim were a de
cree alleged to have been issued by the
King of Spain in 1768, whereby Guiana
was declared to be bordered on the south
by the Amazon and on the east by the At
lantic. Reference to decree shows that it
has no bearing whatever upon the question
of the boundary of the Dutch colonies.
The foregoing examination shows that
the main grounds UDon which the claim of
Venezuela is supposed to be based, so far
as it has been presented to Great Britain
at different times during the last fifty
years, have been as follows:
Firstâ The original discovery and the
first exploration of the South American
continent by Spain, which are clearly ir
relevant.
Secondâ The bull of Pope Alexander VI,
which cannot be considered as having any
real bearing upon the question.
Third â The allegation that the occupa
tion of Guiana by the Dutch was a viola
tion of the treaty of Munsier. This alle
gation has been shown to be unfounded.
Fourth â Possession and occupation by
the Spaniards of the territory south of the
Orinoco, including the rivers Barima,
Morocco and Pomeroon. It has been
shown that the only Spanish settlements
there at any time were San Thome de
Guayana, which was situated on the south
bank of the Orinoco, and which had been
moved from time to time higher up the
river, and it was destroyed by the British
and Dutch successively, and the Capuchin
settlements situated between the Orinoco
and the Tumerimo, as has been previously
described.
Fifthâ That the Dutch had never had
any possessions north of the Essequibo.
This statement has been shown to be
equally erroneous, as a perusal of the
whole diplomatic correspondence will
show that the British Government, while
insisting that the just claini9 of Great
Britain would entitle her to a boundary
embracing practically the whole water
shed of the Essequibo, the Cuyuni, the
Yuruari, the Pomeroon. the. Waini and
Barima, has been willing to agree to a
boundary within those limits, which would
give Venezuela far more territory than
that to which she can show any title.
From the summary given of the forego
ing chapter it will be seen that Great
Britain, while maintaining her just rights,
has consistently shown a desire to make a
fair arrangement with Venezuela as to a
boundary, and that the claim of Venezuela
that her territory extends to the Esse
quibo nas been based upon contentions
which are in no way supported by the
facts and cannot be justified upon any
reasonable ground.
Part fifth describes the maps and basis
of the cases. The first is an extract from
the official chart of the Dutch West India
Company by contemporaneous chart
makers of the approximate date of 1635.
It only deals with the coast line. It shows
the reputed territory of the company as
extended westward beyond Point Barima.
The next map, by a leading Dutch geog
rapher of 1640, is colored to show the
boundary of the Dutch and Spanish colo
nies along the Orinoco. The next map,
dated 1733, was prepared for a commis
sion of the trade plantations. It shows
the Dutch boundary extending from the
Orinoco to the westward of Barima.
In 1748 a map was prepared by Geog
rapher Danville compiled largely from
Spanish sources. This was adopted in
1796 by Father Sobreviela, a missionary
having personal knowledge of Guiana.
On it the boundary of Dutch Guiana starts
a little to the east of Point Barima. The
Dutch used this map in protesting against
the proposed Spanish missions within
their territory.
Anotner map, published in 1884 from
Depon's "Voyage Ameriqae Meridionale,"
taken from a manuscript map in the
archives of Caracas, shows by dotted lines
that the Dutch possessions were bounded
by the Essequibo. Between that line and
the Orinoco the country is marked as
being independent.
The text of Depon's book has a passage
saying it is agreed that Spanish Guiana,
which on the maps occupies thirty leagues
of coast, does not, in fact, occupy an inch.
The statement concludes with a repeti
tion of the propositions maintained
throughout the case. It ends by stating
that the claim of Venezuela that her terri
tory extends to the Essequibo River has
been based upon contentions in no way
supported by facts and cannot be justified
on any reasonable ground. The foregoing
statement and the authorities con
tained in the documents annexed estab
lish, if the matter is treated as
one of strict right, the fact that Oreat
Britain, as the successor to the Dutch, is
entitled to the territory extending to
Barima, including the watersheds of all
rivers south of the Orinoco v?hich flow
into the Atlantic.
The appendix of correspondence con
tains 235 documents, largely relating; to
the administration of British Guiana. The
diplomatic part includes communications
exchanged by Senor Micelena and Lord
Rosebery in the abortive negotiations of
1893 to arrange for arbitration.
AFTER SEVEN
DAYS' SPEECHES
Legislative, Executive and
Judicial Appropriations
Approved.
PASSAGE OF THE BILL.
Important Changes Made in the
Amendments Relating to
Fees and Salaries.
FEDERAL COMMISSIONERS 60.
One Provision That May Tie Up Pro
ceedings Pending in Many Sec.
tions of the Country.
WASHINGTON, D.C., March 6.â After
seven days' consideration, four of which
were devoted to the fee and salary amend
ment, the House to-day passed the legis
lative, executive and judicial appropria
tion bill. Before disposing of the fee and
salary amendment it was changed so as to
forbid the beginning of a prosecution
under the internal revenue law upon the
complaint of a private citizen except by
the written approval of the District At
torney, and further to forbid the appoint
ment of any Federal court officer, includ
ing United States Commissioners, as re
ceiver in any case before a Federal court.
Bartlett and Quigg made an unsuccessful
effort to secure the exemption of the
Southern district of New York from the
operation of that section of the law which
gives the Judges of the District Court
the appointment of United States Com
missioners, all the present Commissioners
being legislated out of office on the 30th of
June next. Bartlett said that the bill was
seriously defective in that it failed to
make provision for validating or continu
ing the proceedings which will be pending
before the hundreds of Commissioners
when they go out of office.
The postoffice appropriation bill was
next taken up and discussed until the hour
of recess.
Besides discussing these two bills the
House passed the House bill requirine
pension agents to make all payments by
check, and agreed to the Senate amend
ments to the House bill makine seven
years continued and unexplained absence
sufficient proof of a soldier's death in
cases of application for pensions.
Hull (R.) of lowa unsuccessfully en
deavored to gain consideration of a bill to
relieve General W. P. Carlin of liability on
account of the expenditure of $1180, made
by a quartermaster officer iv the fall of
1893 in searching for a party of students
who were snowed in in a canyon in the
Bitter Root Mountains, and who, without
the aid of the regular army, would have
perished.
Wilson (R.) of Idaho asked if this was
the party consisting oi General Carlin's
son and some other young men who de
serted a citizen of Idaho and left him to
die.
Hull responded that there was nothing
in the record to show that fact. The bill
went over.
The House then proceeded in committee
of the whole to the further consideration
of the fee and salary amendment to the
legislative, executive and judicial appro
priation bill.
An amendment was agreed to prohib
iting the beginning of any prosecution
under the internal revenue laws upon
complaint of a private citizen, except by
the written approval of the District At
torney.
An amendment was agreed to on motion
of Adams (R.) of Pennsylvania giving to
clerks of courts as well as commissioners
authority to administer oaths.
Bartlett (D.) of Georgia offered an
amendment, which was adopted, forbid
ding the appointment of any Federal
officer or commissioner as receiver in any
suit in the Federal courts.
Upon the motion of the committee and
at the suggestion of the Department of
Justice the bill was amended so as to raise
the per diem of United States Commis
sioners from $:i to $3 50 a day, with a re
striction of one per diem allowance for
any one day.
At 2 :50 r. m. the Hduse passed the legis
lative, executive and judicial appropria
tion bill and then took up the postotÃce
appropriation bill.
Loud (II.) of California, explaining the
provisions of the bill, said that the esti
mates on which the bill was based
amounted to $94,817,900. The bill recom
mends an appropriation of $91,943,757, or
$2,874,142 less than the estimates and
$2,397,760 more than the bill for the cur
rent fiscal year. The estimated postal
revenue for the fiscal year 1897, in the
opinion of the Postmaster-General, will be
$89,763,120, or $1,820,322 less than the ap
propriation recommended by the commit
tee. To meet whatever deficiency may oc
cur in the several appropriations made by
the bill a sum equal to such deficiency of
the revenues of the Postoffice Department
is to be appropriated from the treasury.
In the preparation of the bill Load said
the committee had segregated certain
items from the general appropriation for
free-delivery service, believing that to be
a better plan. In the accounts of the office
of the Second Assistant Postmaster-Gen
eral, Loud said the committee had found
that $570,000 of the appropriation for the
star route service had been diverted to
other purposes, and the appropriation for
that service was reduced by that sum.
which was appropriated to wagon service.
When the accounts of the office of the
Fourth Assistant Postmaster-General were
reached in the course of Loud'a explana
tion, Quigg (R.) of New York asked if the
increase of $32,000 made in the appropria
tion for inspectors would permit* continu
ance of what has .become known to ill
fame as the "spy system."
Loud answered that in his opinion it
would not, but in further answer to
Quigg's questions went into the subject
somewhat at length.
In conclusion Loud gave it as his opinion
that unless conditions in the Postoffice
Department and postal service were
changed by Congress the annual de
ficiency, which had increased from about
$5,000,000 in 1888 to $10,000,000 in 1890,
would increase in the future even more
rapidly.
The reduction of the item for streetcar
fare for carriers met the opposition of the
Chicago members.
The committee rose without having con
cluded general debate on the bill and at 5
o'clock on motion by Loud the House took
a recess until 8 o'clock p. m. to pass private
pension bills.
The House to-night in committee of the
whole considered and laid aside ten pen
sion bills with a favorable recommendation
that they pass. At 10:30 p.m. the House
adjourned until to-morrow.
IS THE SOZDIEJCS* HOMES.
The Attendance Almost Equals the In
fantry ana Artillery of the Army.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 6.âSecre
tary Lamont sent to the House to-day the
report of the inspector-general on the
inspection of the several branches of the
National Home for Disabled Soldiers. It
shows the home to be in good condition
and satisfactorily managed. The average
number of members cared for during the
past year was 16,477, which nearly equals
the combined strength of infantry and
artillery of the army. Adding to this the
average number of members constantly
absent for longer or shorter periods, the
total average number of members reaches
20,207.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 6. -Navy
Department officials say they have not
been informed of the reported landing of
marines at Corinto, Nicaragua, from the
United States steamer Alert, wnich was
sent to that placa to protect American
interests. The department is ignorant
officially of the arrival of the Alert at
Corinto. The only explanation suggested
is that the telegraph lines have been cut.
The news dispatch stating that marines
had been landed at Corinto came from
Panama.
Armament of Fortifications,
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 6.-Secre

additional estimates of the appropriation
of $447,030 for armament of fortifications.
TERMS OF TOLERATION
Under Certain Conditions Catho
lics May Belong to Secret
Societies.
Some Interesting Information Given
in a Recent Decree Issued by
the Pope.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 6.â The Her
ald says tnis morning: Pope Leo XIII has
just issued a decree defining in precise
terms the toleration which may be ex
tended to Catholic members of the orders
of Odd Fellows, Knights of Pythias and
Sons of Temperance, already condemned
by the Pontiff.
The decree is the most important circu
lar which has emanated from the Holy
iSee for several years, affecting as it does
the interests of all the Catholic members
of the orders mentioned, who are said to
number 350,000. It is conveyed in a letter
addressed to the various Bishops by Cardi
nal Satolli. The letter states that as a
general rule it cannot be permitted to
allow one's name to be retained on |the
membership list and to pay dues. Ie may
be tolerated, however, providing the
following four conditions are veriried in
each case:
"First â If the member joined any of
these societies in good faith and before
their condemnation was made known to
him.
"Secondâ Provided no scandal will oc
cur and all danger of such shall be re
moved by a timely declaration to the effect
that the member pay his dues so that he
may not be deprived of the benefits ac
cruing therefrom. The member must,
however, in the meantime abstain from
all association or coniniingline with these
sects.
â¢'Thirdâ The renunciation must entail
upon himself or his family a notable and
serious loss.
"Fourth â There must not be any dan
ger of loss of faith, either for the man
himself or for his family, especially with
regard to the circumstances of sickness or
death, and every possibility of funeral
rites foreign to the Catholic ritual must be
removed."
"These conditions," the letter says,
"when they were made known to his
Holiness were fully approved and con
firmed. Bince, however, the question is a
most grave one and replete with difficul
ties and dangers, and one which affects
not only many dioceses but also ecclesi
astical provinces, the Holy Father, to the
end that a uniform rule should be
observed, orders that in particular cases
your Eminence and your successors in the
Apostolic delegation shall have jurisdic
tion."

Are Not Benefited.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 6.â The
Commissioner of the General Land Office
to-day transmitted to the Senate Commit
tee on Public Lands a letter concerning
the mineral lands classification bill. He
says:
The lands to be classified under the bill be

The lands to be classified in Montana and
Idaho are to a great extent in practically com
pact bodies, and the cost of classifying the
same is doubtless much less per acre than will
be the cost of classifying the settling tracts in
California under this bill.
There are 7,508,000 acres to be examined
under the provisions of the bill. The cost of
examination and expenses in the Idaho dis
trict was six and two-tenths cents, the cost in
other districts ranging from one fifteen hun
dredths to two and three-tenths cents. The
lands in California, having been about half of
them patented and those remaining unpat
ented and to be examined under provisions of
this bill being in isolated tracts, I estimate
the expense would be the same as that for th c
examination for Idaho, to wit, six and two
tenths cents. I therefore estimate that the cost
per acre for examining the lands in California
under the terms of this bill, with salaries of
Commissioners being larger than those of Com
missioners for Idaho, at 5 cents per acre, and
this I think a low estimate. This would give
an estimated total cost of at least $450,000,
and the same may reach $500,000.
The reasons for the enactment of the act of
February do not apply to this bill. In Mon
tana and Idaho not an acre of land has been
patented to the railroad under grant at the
time that bill was introduced. It applied to
new country not fully prospected. This act
applies to isolated tracts on surveyed ground
that has been prospected for years, and
half the granted lands has already been pat
ented to the five corporations affected thereby.
la the Montana act but one company was in
terested.
Under the system of procedure fully estab
lished by the Interior Department the railroad
companies have borne the expeuse of publica
tion, which is required in all cases when land
selected is within six miles of known mineral,
as in this report elsewhere set iortb, and this
procedure has protected the rights of mineral
claimants so well that no comDlaints have been
made ol its action by them.
I therefore report adversely to this bill, as no
good purpose can be subserved by relieving
the railroad companies of the necessary ex
penses attending the selecting and giving
notice to all interested parties before receiving
patents for their grants and putting burden of
classification upon the general public at an ex
pense of not less than $450,000.
This bill gives Commissioners in addition to
$10 per day "their necessary expenses,"
which must be estimated at not less than $5
per dayâ thus making classifications more ex
pensive, even if the opportunities in.California
were as favorable as in Montana. Summarized
my objections to the bill are: It is expensive
to the Government; it is not as efficient and
accurate in its results as the departmental
method of classification; it lays the burden on
the people instead of the principal benefi
ciaries.
If, however, Congress should determine to
classify lands in California, aa is contemplated
in the bill, I recommend that it be amended as
follows: In section 2, page 4, lines one and
two, it is suggested to 6trike out the words
"their actual expenses incurred while in the
performance of their official duties" and to
substitute therefor a fixed daily sum, "in lieu
of subsistence," or make no allowance for sub
sistence or expenses.
In section 3, page 5, between lines 21 and
22. add the following proviso: "And provided
further, tnat this act shall not apply to any
lands in which publication has been made, or
been ordered, by the General Land Office under
the circular of tne Department of the Inte
rior, approved July, 1894, and that all such
lands so published, or ordered to be published,
shall proceed to patent under existing regula
tions."
All lists of selections of odd-numbered sec
tions within these grants are, under the cir
cular of July 9, 1894, thoroughly examined in
connection with records of this office, and all
tracts within a radius of six miles of any min
eral entry, claim or location are eliminated
therefrom. A supplemental list of the rejected
tracts is tben prepared and the railroad re
quired to publish for sixty days. From such
published list is eliminated all lands that have
been protested, or contested, or claimed to be
more valuable for mineral than for agricul
tural purposes. The clear lands are certified
to the department for approval and patenting
a* agricultural, while hearings are ordered to
determine the characters of lands protested,
contested or claimed as mineral. It will be
seen that this procedure accomplishes the re
sults sought to be attained by this bill.
Many such lists have been published and
hearings ordered and had on protests filed as a
result thereof. It is thought that no good pur
pose would be subserved by having practically
the name action again, and an amendment to
section 3 has for that reason been suggested.
In section 8, line 2, page 10, triice - out : the
words "twenty thousand" and si>stitutethere
for the words "forty thousand.". It was esti
mated that $36,000 will be necesary as salar
ies and $4000 for publication art incidental
expenses. These figures are base upon facts
developed by practical operations the act of
February 26, 1895,' as $2.0,000 will for ser
vices for 100 days only. 1

ELEVEN HEN BADLY BUR* ED.
The Valte of a Defective Boiler Blew Out
Scattering Sea/ding Steam Upon
Workmen.
CHICAGO, 111., March 6.â Eleven me*
were seriously burned this afternoon in a
boiler explosion at the Troy Laundry, 395
Fifth avenue. The fire which followed the
explosion was quickly extinguished. Those
injured were: William Grant, E. Berry,
iP. Kaine, Samuel Marsola, Frank Mar
sola, Thomas Hubbard, E. W. Gross, Wil
liam Dalber, Samuel Jerwasa, F. Kelly
and Engineer Grant. All the victims were
removed to the County Hospital.
Berry of 2239 Wentworth avenue was the
most seriously burned. He was standing
near the door of the engine-room when
the "F" valve, which, it is alleged, was de
fective, blew out. The escaping steam
struck him full in the face and he fell to
the floor half-conscious. Two of his fel
low-workmen dragged him across to the
other side of the basement, and in doing so
they were severely scalded. The men
were in the basement making an excava
tion for a new boiler, under the direction
of the engineer.

Indictment of a Profeator at the Drake
Medical College*
DES MOINES. lowa, March 6.â The
Grand Jury to-day indicted Dr. \Viiton W.
McCarthy, demonstrator of anatomy in
Drake Medical College, on the charge of
receiving stolen goods. The indictment
is the result of a long investigation into
the grave robbery cases in this vicinity.
About three weeks ago a man named
Claycolm, from Omaha, came here with
two bodies stolen from cemeteries at
Omaha. He was arrested when delivering
them to the college and said that he had
an appointment to meet Dr. McCarthy
when the delivery wa3 made and receive
his pay for the bodies. On this and other
evidence the indictment was returned.

children in a small house. Neighbors saw
the building burning last night and when
the fire was out the bodies of the entire
family were found in the ruins.
March
April, May are most emphatically the
months for taking a good blood purifier,
because the system is now most in need of
such a medicine, and because it more
quietly responds to medicinal qualities.
In winter impurities do not pass out of the
body freely, but accumulate* in the blood.
April
The best medicine to purify, enrich and
vitalize the blood, and thus give strength
and build up the system, is Hood's Sarsa-

Medicine, and more are taking it to-day
than ever before. If you are tired, "out of
May
sorts," nervous, have bad taste in th*
morning, aching or dizzy head, sour

Hood's Barsaparilla will put your whole

Speeches Made by Democrats Cause
Great Excitement in the Joint
Assembly.
FRANKFORT, Ky., March 6.â lnterest
in to-day's joint session exceeded any
thing since the first days of the long and
tiresome session. The nomination of Col
onel St. John Boyle by the Republicans
last night and the wide split on the Demo
cratic side' as a result of Blackburn's re
fusal to withdraw had created a belief that
to-day might bring some sensational
changes in the monotonous situation.
The break to Carlisle began on the Dem
ocratic side when Senator Elliston's name
was called. He voted for Carlisle and was
followed soon by Senators Holloway, Noe,
Halyer, Smith, Stephenson, besides Weis
incer, who had bolted all along. The Rep
resentatives who deserted to Carlisle were
Baird, Dougherty, Norman and N. N.
Rice. Populist Edrington, who has here
tofore voted for Blackburn, voted to-day
for i*etit (Pop.), as did Poor.
A wild scene was created when Robblns,
a Blackburn man, made a speech de
nouncing the perfidy of the sound-money
men, who he said had sworn to stand by
the caucus nominee.
Witt of Owen followed in a short speech,
going over to Carlisle. A great deal of ex
citement resulted and it was with diffi
culty that Lieutenant-Governor Worthine
ton preserved order. The sergeant-at
arms Had to clear the galleries before the
crowd could be got under control. The
ballot resulted : Boyle 63. Blackburn 48,
Carlisle 15, Petit 2.

two votes of an election. At the con
clusion of the ballot the Assembly ad

CHICAGO, 111., March 6.â A special to

Senator Cullom to-day for the first time
openly avowed his candidacy for the Re
publican nomination for the Presidency,
and declared he was in the race to stay

"I am a candidate for President. lam
not a quitter. lam in the race to stay. A
large number of my friends asked me to
enter and I did. I appreciate the honor
tney did me and the many expressions of
friendship which have since come to me."
The question was asked: "Senator, will
you withdraw?"
" "No, I will not withdraw so long as a
majority of the Illinois delegates remain
uninstrueted. I don't want any delegates
instructed for me. I have repeatedly said
that, and the result has been that many
delegates who would otherwise have been
instructed for'nie were elected without in
structions. I could have had the dele
gates from Cook County instructed forme,
but I specially requested that they be un
instrueted, and that was done.'
"Some people have said you became a
candidate to draw the McKinley fire to
Keed." .
"Such people are ignorant of the lacts.
lam no stoolpigeon for any one. I am a
candidate in my sole interest. I shall re
main such a candidate until the conven

HAS AOT KEPT V f RATES.
Defects in the Tooling Arrangements of
Trunk Lines.
CHICAGO, 111.. March 6. -The pooling
arran-ementfor Western trunk line freight
business which was made by the members
of the Western Freight Association at the
beginning of the year has not been effect
ive in maintaining the agreed rates among
the parties in the pool. Rouiia-about
â routes South and Southwest have cut into
the pooling scheme by offering reduced
rates, and in the present state of trade the
road making the lowest rate, irrespective
of its being circuitous, gets the freight.
The lines in the pool are thus forced to se
cretly cut the agreed rates, which are con- (
sidered higher than present depressed
prices of goods warrant, in order to pet
any business.
It is reported that the Southern Pacific
and the Illinois Central railroads will co
operate in the construction of a big bridge
over the Mississippi at Southport, an en
abling act of Congress having been passed.
These two roads are now closely allied in
a transcontinental policy of mutual inter
ests and are steadily cultivating closer re
lations to the discomfiture of the northerly
transcontinental roads.

Speaking of this dispatch President
Cleveland to-day said to a reporter of the

"I see that it is assumed in certain quar
ters that a deliverance published a few
days ago on the Cuban question may be
taken as denning the attitude of the ad
ministration on that subject. I wish you
would say that I never saw the state
ment nor heard of it until I read it
in the newspaper, and even then
neglected to read all of it, sup
posing it represented nothing more than a
newspaper guess. I don't know how it
originated, nor by whom it was constructed
or inspired, but I do know that I am in no
manner responsible for it nor in any way
related to it."
The statement thus repudiated by the
President was*largely made up of clip

Secret Society Members Will Look
After Their Welfare Until the

SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 6.â Four lit
tle children, the oldest under ten years,
started alone to-day for Charleston, 111.,
with the corpse of their mother. They
boarded the Chicago Limited and took
seats among a number of strangers, who
were laugbinz and chatting. There was
no indication in the faces of the men and
women that death was near. Outside on
the platform there was a rattling and
banging of trunks and the usual noise of
a railway station. Baggagemen tenderly
picked up a long box and placed it among
the trunks in the forward car.the remainder
of the trunks and valises were piled in,
and the conductor looked acain at his
watch as the time for departure neared.
Everybody seemed to be lighthearted,
but the children were sad-faced, and
the youngest, a 3-year-old tot, began to
cry for its mother. The eldest girl wiped
away the little one's tears and spoke com
forting words, although the spring of her
own sorrows was full to overflowing.
A man and woman entered the car with
the little ones and endeavored to make
them cheerful, but they could not bring
smiles to the sad faces, though the
tears were dried. When the conductor
shouted"Al! aboard !"the man and woman,
their own eyes filled with tears, hurried
out to the platform, aiter giving the little
ones a farewell kiss. The engine started and
soon the last coach was out of siÂ«ht around
the bend at Cedar street. The man and
womln watched it as far as they could see
any part of the train and then turned
away. "Poor little things, " they said.
Tne four little children were those of
Mrs. Ada Mathes, who died at 234 Grand
avenue on Wednesday from consumption.
She had come here five weeks ago from
Charleston, 111., with her children, and
when she died the little ones were left
alone, and alone they are going with her
remains to Charleston.
The father of the little children had be
longed to a fraternal organization, and
the members of the organization did
everything they could to make the or
phans comfortable. Telegrams were sent
ahead to-day to lodges along the road re
questing tnat the travelers be looked after,
and it is probable that they will be well
cared for along iheir homeward way.
STARTS FOR ITALY.
Prince Luigi'* Visit Cut Short by the
Startling AetrÂ« From Rome.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 6.â Prince
Luigi of Savoy is on his way to Italy. He
did not stop long in San Diego. The
Cristoforo Colombo arrived outside this
morning and anchored off Hotel Del Coro
nado. The Prince, Consul - General
Grimaldi of San Francisco and several of
the officers of the warship came ashore
and called on Mayor Carlson, but the
Mayor was then on his way to the Co
lombo. Prince Luigi and his companions
were driven about the city for an hour or
so by prominent Italians, and then re
turned to the ship. Consul Grimaldi left
for San Francisco.
Mayor Carlson was cordially received by
Captain Bertolini of the warship, and a
hearty invitation was extended to come
into the harbor. Captain Bertolini re-
sponded that such had been his intention,
but the startling news from Italy had
caused the deepest grief on board his
vessel and it was his personal wish, as well
as that of the prince and other officers, to
avoid any public demonstrations or inter
change of courtesies while their country
was mourning the death of her soldiers.
For that reason, he said, he was going
home as fast au possible and he had de
cided not to come inside, as courtesy
would require that he ruaKe a stop of a
week at least in order to pay his respects
to Rear Admiral Beardslee, the civil and
military authorities, and the Italian
colony.
The Colombo sailed at 9 o'clock to-night,
turning her nose directly southward. She
will stop at Acapulco "for coal and then
proceed to Callao, where she will remain
a week or more. The return to Italy will
take about eighty days.
REALISTIC CHICO THEATRICALS.
Horse and Rider Fall Front a Scaffold
ing IMiring a Rehearsal.
CHICO, Cal., March 6.â During a re
hearsal of the drama, "Pleasures of Paris,"
at the Armory Opera-house last evening,
one of the horses used in a scene fell from
a high scaffolding. A young boy was rid
ing the animal, but fortunately escaped
injury, as did the persons taking part la
the rehearsal, but tne accident caused a
panic on the stage.
The drama was given by Theodore Kre
mer, an actor, assisted by local talent, to
night, the rehearsal last night being the
last before the presentation. In one scene
three horses mount a large scaffolding.
The rehearsal was progressing nicely when
the signal was given for the animals to
enter. The first one, ridden by young
John Robinson, went bravely up the scat
folding, but after reaching it made a mis
step. Sudden ly there was a heavy crash
and horse and rider went tumbling to the
stage.
The women who were to figure in "The
Pleasures of Paris" screamed and one
fainted. Several of the male amateurs
hastened to the assistance of the boy, but
he was found to be more scared than"hurt,
having received but a few bruises. Blood
was pouring from the horse's nostrils, but
the animal survived the crash.
AXGBT FREBXO JURORS.

FRESNO, Cal., March 6.â lt has de
veloped here that in the expenditure of
public moneys there is a great difference
as to who gets the short end. The late
Grand Jury of this county spent many
days and a few sleepless nights in formu
lating a report that would r*p many an
official knuckle with a documentary
cudgel. Throughout its report of fifty type
written pages economy, with a large "E."

The tables have been turned. The board,
at its session to-day, passed an order de
nying to each of the nineteen gram) jurors
pay for six days' hard labor in behalf of
the taxpayers of the county. And this
was done "by the advice of District Attor
ney Snow on the ground that the Jast six
days of the session came after the new
Grand Jury was drawn. The jurymen de
clare they" will not accept a reduction of
$12 in their bills, and will enter suit unless
they are paid for the whole time they were
in session, amounting in this case to nfty

Aged Mortimer Kilgore Tries
to Murder Constable
Kelton.
Claims the Young Man's Family
Turned Him Out on the Streets
to Starve.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., March 6.â A
furor was created on .State street this after
noon by a quiet-looking, elderly man, who
walked up to Constable Clarence Kelton
and pointing a revolver at his breast re
marked, "Well, my boy, I've got you
now." Before he could pull the trigger
Kelton turned the weapon aside with a
blow and friends intervened.
The assailant was Mortimer Kilgore, and
this is the second time within twelve
months that he has attempted young
Kelton's life. Kilgore is an old man,
much respected in this and Ventura coun
ties, where he has lived for more than
twenty years. He gives as the reason for
his desperate act that the Keltons, with
whom he made his home for several years,
Received many benefits at his hand's and
turned him out, feeble and t>enniless, to
make a living as best he could. He was
immediately examined before Justice
Crane and "released on $1000 bail, which
was promptly secured, with Sanford Dar
ling and \V. S. Low as bondsmen. 1 Upon
the occasion of his former assault he went
to jail, but was afterward released without
prosecution.

CHOKED BY AN IMBECILE.
W. R. Laugenour of Woodland
Attacked on a Passenger
Train.
A Crazy Man Seizes Him by the
Throat and Attempts to End
His Life.
WOODLAND, Cal., March (5.â W. R.
Laugenour, brother of Hon. H. W. Lauge
nour of this city, had a thrilling expe
rience witn an insane man last night.
Mr. .Laugenour and his wife were passen
gers on train No. 49 from Oakland to
Woodland. Shortly after leaving Oakland
a well-dressed man approached Laueen
our and demanded that he stop talking
about him. Laugenour supposed that his
auestioner had imbibed too freely, and to
placate the stranger and at the same time
rid himself of undesirable company prom
ised that he would not talk about him
again.
A few minutes later the man hastily
walked up to Laugenour again, and, grasp
ing him by the throat, attempted to choke
him to death. He was finally shaken off.
Laugenour then realized tnat he was deal
ing with a crazy man, and wisely deter
mined not to aggravate him by further
resistance, if it were possible to avoid it.
Laugenour asked for protection and was
removed by the brakeman to another car.
It was ascertained ttiat the insane man
was from Marysville, and that he had been
in a San Francisco home for inebriates.
During the remainder of the trip he was
carefully guarded.

BOTH LOVED A
PASADENA DAME.
John Barker's Jealousy Led
to the Murder of
Handell.
TOLD AT THE INQUEST.
The Putative Wife, of the Slayer
Was His Victim's Former
Sweetheart.
ROMANCE ENDS IN TRAGEDY.
The Cause of the Trouble Assists in the
Murderer's Search for His
Rival.
PASADENA, Cal., March 6. A Coro
ner's inquest was held this afternoon over
the body of William Handel 1, who was
shot yesterday by John A. Barker. Tne
verdict was that death resulted from gun
shot wounds inflicted by J. A. Barker,
with intent to kill. The testimony showed
that Handell was shot in the back either
while lying down, or that he fell at the
first shot and received the second bullet
after the fall. His pockets contained $2 75.
He was unarmed.
Handell was engaged to marry Mrs.
Barker in his youth. They drifted
apart, and she went to live with
Barker, who had deserted a former wife
and daughter. Handell, never forgetting
his old sweetheart, followed her to Pasa
dena, and they again became intimate.
Handell lived for many months in Bar
ker's house, and relatives of Mrs Barker
claim that, by means of threats and black
mail, Barker succeeded in getting money
from Handell, who at that time held a
lucrative position, while Barker was idle.
Letters from Mrs. Barker to Handell are
in the possession of the officers, and a
written statement from her acknowledg
ing her relations with Handell is said to
be in the possession of the District Attor
ney. It is alleged that Barker and the
woman were never married. They have
three children.
Handell married some years ago, and
his wife is confined at the Highland in
sane asylum, where Hanaell was al9O once
sent but made his escape. Their two chil
dren are in an orphan home in South Pasa
dena. Since his escape from the asylum
Handell's one idea seems to have been to
win back the affections of the woman he
courted in youth and followed and perse
cuted with his attentions with or without
encouragement. It is believed that he
sought Mrs. Barker yesterday with no in
tention of molesting her husband, as he
was unarmed.
Mrs. Barker testified at the inquest that
Handel I came to the house about 9 o'clock
and upbraided her with having illtreated
him and testified falsely against him. She
denied the charge and begged him to go
away, as sha feared that if her busband
found him there would be trouble. When
her husband came in, however, she as
sisted in the search for Jiandell, pointing
out the path he had taken.
Barker is lodged in the county jail, to
await the results of the preliminary exam
ination, which will be held Mopday.

THE NEWS OF SAN JOSE
Amelia Robertson Secures a Par
tition of the Chynoweth
Estate.
A Drunken Man's Error Leads to His
Arrest for Forgeryâ A Queen for
the Carnival.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 6.â Judge Lori
gan this morning rendered a decision in
the suit of Amelia Robertson et al. against
Ellen C. Lyon et al., an action brought to
have one-third of a 100-acre tract of land
near Eden vaie partitioned in favor of the
plaintiff. The land is valued at $60,000.
Mrs. Robertson was the wife of Louis
Chynoweth, now deceased. In nis life
time he executed a deed to his wife of his
one-third interest, delivering it to her with
the instruction that it was not to be re
corded until his death and he was not to
be deprived of the ownership until then.
The defendants did not deny the execu
tion of tne deed, but held that it was only
intended to act as a security for debts, and
that the interest of the deceased in the
property should constitute apart of his
estate and be administered upon and dis
tributed according to law.
The court held that according to the
presumption of the law the delivery of the
deed was to be concurrent with its date,
and judgment was given for the plaintiff.
STICK EM Ay WAS DRVNK.
Drew a Chech on the Wrong Bank and
Was Arrested for Forgery.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 6.â Thomas
Stickeman, who was arrested at Soquel
yesterday on a charge of having passed a
worthless check on Charles Applegren, the
proprietor of the Albion Hotel in this
city, was arraigned before Justice Gass
this morning on a cnarge of forgery.
On February 22 Applegren cashed for
Stickeman a cfieck drawn on the Bank of
San Jose for $10 and signed by Mrs. J. E.
Stickeman. When presented at the bank
the check was returned, with the informa
tion that there were no funds to the credit
of Mrs. J. E. Stickeman. Stickeman
claimed he had committed no forgery, as
he had the power of attorney to sign his
mother's name, but that he was drunk
when he wrote the check and made it pay
able at the Bank of San Jose instead of the
City Bank of Santa Cruz. He said if the
check was forwarded to Hanta Cruz it
would be cashed by the City Bank.
The City Bank of Santa Cruz and Mayor
Effey of that place were communicated
with and they bore out Stickeman's story.
As there was no forgery committed and
the drawing of the check on the Bank of
San Jose was a mistake committed while
Stickeman was drunk, Justice Gass dis
missed the complaint.

A TRAGEDY AT IRONDALE
Diver Pecarle Killed While At
tempting to Blow Up a
Hulk.
He Is Hurled Into the Sea by an
Explosion and Sinks to the
Bottom.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., March 6.â
In attempting to break ud the hulk of the
wrecked steamer Idaho at Irondale this
afternoon Peter Pecarle, a professional
diver of Seattle, exploded seventy- six
sticks of dynamite, and is now a corpse at
the bottom of the sea. He was standing
on a float near the wreck, dressed in his
armor, and there calmly lighted a fuse
and waited for the explosion. He was
warned to stand back out of danger, and
replied, "I'm all right."
Scarcely had he uttered the words when
a frightful explosion occurred within five
feet of where he was standing. The float
was sent up into the air to a height of fifty
feet, and the diver came down with the
debris. His body has not been recovered,
the heavy suit of armor having carried it
to the bottom. He had taken off his hel
met, belt and shoe 9, which permitted the
water to flow inside the diving suit.
The distressing accident was witnessed by
a dozen workmen, many of whom were
carried off their feet by the force of the
shock. Every effort was made to recover
the body with grappling hooks, but with
out success, and it is supposed to be
caught in the timbers and debris of the
vessel.
Pecarle lived on Pnget Sound for many
years, and used the schooner Ellida in his
trade of recovering iron and valuables
from old wrecks.

PROBING THE
CARSON STEAL
Recovery of a Record\Book
Long Missing in
the Mint.
ADMITTED IN EVIDENCE
Supplies the . Proof That Jones,
and Not Zabriskie, Was in
Active Charge.
'â Â» _____ â  â  â 
HIRSCH HARRIS TESTIFIES.
How the Shortage Was Discovered
and His Predecessor Placed
Under Suspicion.
CARSON, 'Net., March The long
missing record book of tags in ihe Carson
mint was found last night in the cupel
room, where it had been placed for safe
keeping during the Pierce regime. This
book will play a part in the trial of John
T. Jones for complicity with James Heney,
convicted of having stolen bullion to the
value of $23,000 from the mint. This
morning the bullion tags from July 10,
1895, to May, 1894, were placed in evidence j
to show tnat Jones was in active charge of
the reiineryjduriug Zabriskie's terra. The
tags were read to the jury, and were either
signed "John T. Jones" or "Zabriskie, per
Thompson"; none were signed by
Zabriskie.
Melter and Refiner Hirsch Harris to-day
testified that he was appointed on June 1,
: - '.. and received the keys on June 8. The
spurious melt was passed ia to him in the
.-â i settlement as containing 1143.055
ounces of gold 4^2} j fine. The weight of
the spurious bar was exactly the same as
the original Bodie melt. Jone s and
Zabriskie were both present, and Jones
checked off the spurious bar with the rest
when they had a settlement.
'When tie granulations were beine ]
made," said Harris, "I suggested to Jones ;
that they be assayed, but he said granula
tions were never assayed because two !
granulations might differ ten points. If ;
those granulations had been assayed the ;
shortage would have been detected at
once. When Mason got here he began
checking the barS. When he reached the
settlement melts he began assaying. I
The bogus bullion had the right number, j
corresponding with the records, and the I
right weight, but instead of 4*2 ounces of !
gold it contained only 14} a ' ounces, a loss j
of $20,000."
The records show that bar 164 was re- '
ceived on November 9, 1592. No. 77 had
been stamped on the bar, but as it fell j
below the required fineness in gold a few
points the 77 was canceled with a cold
chisel and No. 164, the amount of the
silver purchase, was placed there. On the
bar in evidence the 77 was not canceled,
which proved that the persons who did it
neglected to place the same marks on it
that had been there originally.
'â¢I investigated the metal in the mint,"
Harris continued, "and found there was a
shortage of 40*30 ounces of gold, in value
over $"5,000. I spoke to Jones of the de
ficiency, and he said not to mind that, as
I would find it in the slums. When I got
the Elum returns I saw I did not have
enough and asked for a clean-up. Jones
told me that my figures were wrong, that
Buch a shortage was impossible. The
metal did not come up to its pretended
value, as stamped on the bars. There
must have been $20,000 less in the bars
than was claimed.
"I tried to trace the consolidation melts,
but could not, as the record is broken. No.
7 was made in December, 1892. The hand
writing is that of John T. Jones. The
records do not show consolidations 8, 9, 10
and 11, but 12 is there. The records had
been mutilated by tearing out the leaves."
The first loss Harm had noticed was of
1")00 ounces of gold out of a melt of 3000
ounces. Other losses came rapidly on the
heels of this, and he finally ordered a
clean-UD. It was possible that the deposit
room molds were used to make the bogus
melt.
FOR KILLING TWO MEN
H. v F. Yokum Held for Trial for a
Double Shooting at
Centerville.
A Talesman Causes Merriment by a
Denunciation of SelfÂ«
Defense.
OROVILLE, Cal., March 6.â The trial
of H. F. Yokum, charged with the mur
der of Albert Mason and Frank Ballew
sit Centerville on December 14. last, began
to-day in the Superior Court. A jury
was secured and the case went over
until to-morrow.
An amusing incident occurred this
morning during the examination of
Talesman I\. Woodward of Chico. He
was asked if he had any conscientious
scruples against bringing in a verdict of
guilty of murder if the evidence justified.
He answered that personally he had, but
if the law made it out that a man waÂ«
guilty he would have to bring in such a
verdict. He was asked if he believed in
self-defense. He answered that he did not.
One of the attorneys for the defense then
said to the juror:
"If a man attempted to shoot you and
you could prevent it by killing him, would
you do it or would you allow yourself to be
shot?"
The court and the spectators broke fnto
a roar of laughter when the answer came:
"I would allow myself to be shot."
The killing of Ballew and Mason oc
curred in front of Yokum's dwelling. The
accused man claims that the pair had
Bought him out with the avowed intention
of killing him. They had quarreled over
some wood-chopping on land owned by
Yokum. The shooting was witnessed by
the wife of Yokum and Allen Boydstun of
Chico.
Boydstun statei that Yokum and him
self had been hunting squirrels and had
just returned home when Ballew and
Mason came to Yokum's house. Yokum
invited them to come in, but they refused,
requesting him to come out iiito the yard.
Ballew said, "We nave come here to do
you up," and with that he placed his hand
upon his hip pocket.
Yokum immediately raised his shotgun
and fired, first at Ballew and then at Ma
son. He then dropped the shotgun, caught
up a rifle and rired two more shots at Ma
son. The body of Ballew was found about
100 yards from Yokum's house. Mason
walked about an eighth of a mile to a
neighbor's house. He was fatally wounded,
having received one charge from the shot
gun and two from the rifle and died the
following morning.

WARM SPRINGS CONTEST
Two San Jose Pugilists Fight to
a Finish in Alameda
County.
Toney Flores Is Knocked Out by Mat
Sinoch in the Fifteenth
Round.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 6.â About 300
spectators attended a prize-fight at Warm
| Springs, just across the line in Alameda
; County, last night. The mill was between
| Toney Flores and Mat Sinoch, both of this
city. The fight was a hot one from the
start and was won by Sinoch in the
; fifteenth round.
The battle took place in a barn in the
rear of the Warm Springs Hotel. Arrange
ment? had been maae some time ago, but
I tlie promoters Kept very quiet to prevent
j the authorities from interfering. Some
I 200 sports from this city were in attend
; ance. Sinoch fought at 132 pounds and
j Fiores at I4U.
Up to the twelfth round honors were
even, when Flores caught several hard
drives and became groggy. Sinoch kept
hammering away at him and finally
knocked him out in the fifteenth round.
The fight was for a purse of $50 and the
gate receipts.

SAN JOSE, Cal., March 6.â "Dropsy?
Nit!" was the sententious retort of John
L. Sullivan when questioned as to the
rumor that he was a victim of the dread
disease and that his da}'s were numbered.
"lhat story," continued the ex-cham
pion, '"is a canard started by Harry Weldon,
sporting editor of the Cincinnati Enquirer.
I never feit better in my lifeâ oat three
square meals a day and sleep like a top.
Dropsy! Hawâ haw â haw!" and the ox
pugilist indulged in a chuckle that had
none of the invalid about it.
Regarding Corbett and Fitzsimmons,
Sullivan said that they were now simply
living off the people's money, and if they
intended to keep it up much longer they
would have to make some kind of a
showing.
Should they meet in the ring, with Cor
bett in good "fettle, he believed the Cali
fornian would again become the cham
pion. He was a shiftier man and a better
general. Jr'itzsimmons could hit harder
than Corbett, but hard hitting alone could
not win the battle.
And, too, the condition of fighters was
constantly changing, like that of fast
horses, and a man who put up a good bat
tle to-day might be whipped easily a week
from now.
CHICAGO ATHLETES 31 AT DECLINE
But They Have Oreat JResptct for the
California Hoys.
CHICAGO. 111., March 6.â The Univer
sity of California has challenged the Uni
versity of Chicago to a dual track and
field athletic meeting some time in June
or earlier. The challenge was received
yesterday, but if Stagg. does not change
his mind in the next twenty-four hours
the challenge will be declined. The Cali
fornia athletes proposed to hold the dual
contest immediately before or after the
Western intercollegiate championship
meeting. Stasrg, however, thinks that the
armory, the triangular, the Illinois and
Western meets are enough for the candi
dates, and this ia one reason why he will
decline to meet the far Western men.
Professor Stagg has great respect for the
Calif ornians as athletes and thinks that
with proper training the Pacific Coast
should'turn out the best athletes in the
world. "I was surprised," lie said, "at
the magnificent specimens I saw out there
a year ago. There is none like them in
this country. The reason I attribute
mainly to the climate and the country in
general. Without any inconvenience
whatever they can exercise outdoors the
year round, and this will develop the body
to a aegfee impossible to attain in a gym
nasium. When we are ready to begin to
train in the open air they arÂ« already well
seasoned anti prepared to commence op
erations. We should be glad to meet
them, but have too much on our hands
now, and, besides, the guarantee they ask
is exorbitant." ,

NEW YORK, N. V., March 6.â The
professional ranks in cycling will be
augmented this season by Harry Wheeler,
who has decided not to go abroad. Within
a fortnight Wheeler will go to Savannah
to tiain for the early races. It was stated
to-day on very good authority that the
great "Zim" would very likely be seen on
the path in this country during the coming
season.

OGDEN, Tltah, March 6.â The Equitable

MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 6. -
Wednesday marked an important epoch
in the history of the Mill Valley and
Mount Tamalpais Scenic Railway. The
first engine to be used on the mountain
road arrived here ana was transferred
from one of the flatcars of the North Pa
cific Railroad to an improvised track on
the O'Shaughnessy block near Eastland.
The engine is one of the latest pattern
and was manufactured in the East by the
Lima company. It is of peculiar construc
tion and specially adapted to mountain
climbing. All the machinery is upon one
side, while the boiler rests upon the other
side. The engine weighs twenty tons and
is the property of a lumber company
which loaned it to the Mill Valley and
Mount Tamalpais Scenic Kailway until
the Ist of May, when another and larger
locomotive will be sent to Mill Valley in
its place.
Secretary Louis L. Janes of the moun
tain road company to-day said that the
engine which arrived on Wednesday was
to be used during the construction of the
road. When it is completed a thirty-ton
engine, which has already been ordered
and is now being built, will arrive..
"The new engine," said Mr. Janes, "will
be capable of traveling at the rate of
twelve miles an hour, which, owing to its
peculiar construction, is considered quite a
good rate. The locomotive is not built
for speed, but it has enormous power and
could easily haul three or four crowded
cars over the' route of the mountain road
if it should become necessary to accommo
date such a crowd.
"We are pushing work along as rapidly
as possible. Already the ties for over a
mile of the road have arrived ana we ex-
pect the rails almost any day. As soon as
the}' get here the road from Mill Valley to
Blythedale will be constructed, and the
engine which arrived this week will De
used to carry the rails and ties up to the
men at work on the mountain."
When the engine arrived almost the
entire population of Mill Valley turned
out to see it. After it had been removed
from the flatcar to the improvised track a
house was built around it.
President J. B. Stetson of the North
Pacific Coast Railroad was here this week,
and arrangements were made by which
the railroad and the mountain road will
build one large depot at Eastland, the
right-hand side to be used by the moun
tain road and the other side by the North
Pacific Coast road. A large freight-shed
will also be built.
The Tamalpais mountain road will be
propelled by electricity, and the engine
purchased from the Lima company will
be used only in case of crow ds. Two cars
â double-enders â will soon be built and
work on the power-house is shortly to be
commenced. The railroad will Jay a third
rail as far as the proposed power-house, so
as to have the freight and machinery with
out loss of time.
The bitter cold of the last few days has
told upon the workmen employed by the
California Construction Company. The
roof of their quarters on the mountain has
leaked and the water soaked their bed
covers. The cold has been most intense
on the mountain and the trails have been
covered with ice and dangerously slippery.
Yesterday a foreman left the company's
employ. When he went to get his pay he
was offered $4, which he refused to accept.
He said he had been working for the com
pany for nineteen days in the position of
foreman. When he resigned he was in
formed that 10 per cent of his wages would
be deducted on account of his leaving be
fore the month was up. Not only was
this 10 per cent deducted, but 10 per cent
was added for every article he had pur
chased from the store of the construction
company during this time. When the
paymaster finished his figuring the ex
foreman was informed that just $4 was
due him.
POMONA'S FATAL AFFRAY.
Robert M. Sebastian Stabbed to
Death by His Brother
in-Law.
Forced Into a Scuffle by \he Mur
derer, Who Was Intoxicated
and Quarrelsome.
POMONA, Cal., March 6.â Robert M.
Sebastian was stabbed to death at his
home in the west part of the city this
evening by his brother-in-law, Matthew
McGinnis. The latter had been drinking
and was ugly, and provoked a quarrel. He
got into a scuttle with Sebastian and
stabbed him with a penknife in the groin,
penetrating the main artery. The wounded
man ran out of the house and across the
street, where ho fell and bled to death
within live minutes. Officers were notified,
and the murderer is in jail.
Mrs. Sebastian had run out of the house
and nailed a deputy constable from
Spadra, telling him the men were quarrel
ing inside. Instead of going in to stop the
fight, he came on to Pomona and notified
the local officers. The friends of the mur
dered man are greatly indignant at the
officer's cowardice.

FRPjSNO, Cal.. March 6.â The new
electric-rower company from the San
Joaqnin River and the old company,
which has Deen in business here for years,
last night bid against each other for light
ing this city. The result was that the city
wiil be lighted for a third or less of what
it has cost heretofore. Two thousand
candle-power lamps, to burn all night,
will cost $6 40 a month each. This was
the new company's bid, while the old
company's was $0 05. The same lamps to
burn till 1 a. m., were $4 05 a month by the
old company, and will be $5 45 by the new.
The contract has not yet been let.
SILVER BRICKS FOUXD.
Discovery by Children in the Mountains
\ear JUaricopn.
MARICOPA, Abiz.. March 6.â A Mexi
can has brought in two bricks of silver
which he claims were found by children
in the mountains two or three miles south
of this junction. There are good reasons
for supposing that there are plenty more
to come, although the finder denies that
he has more. The bricks have the appear-,
ance of age and whence they originally
came from is an entire mystery. They
are probably worth $50 to $60 each and
may have been hidden plunder from some
robbery long gone by. The bars are now
in the safe of Williams Bros, of the Junc
tion Hotel here.
NECESSITY OP FEDERATION.

SYDNEY, N. S. W., March 6.â A con

yesterday. A series of resolutions were
adopted affirming the urgent necessity of
federation, in which direction the enabling
bill was a material step, and the desira
bility of amending the military laws in
the direction of uniformity. The resolu
tions also declared in favor of the estab
lishment of a cordite factory in Australia,
and other measures of defense.
The conference decided that it was de
sirable to immediately apply the acts for
the restriction of Chinese immigration to
all colored races.

gypsy king, has, by tacit consent, as
sumed control of the camp.
He was directing all matters pertaining
to the coming funeral yesterday, and in
these preparations all the dwellers in the
tented village deferred to him.
He is not the eldest son living at the
camp. The eldest is a man in delicate
health and for that reason not desirous of
assuming the responsibilities of the sta
tion. William, the next in age, is a stal
wart, handsome youth of less than 23
years. He is a modest young man, who is
more conscious of the cares than the
honors of his station.
The sound of ruournine was heard in the
camp on Fifteenth street all day. The
widow, who still shows traces of the
youthful beauty that took the English
sailor captive forty years ago, is especially
stricken by the loas.
The funeral service will take place at
the camp to-morrow at Ip. m. Eev. Wil
liam A. Breck, the assistant rector of St.
John the Evangelist's Church, will offici
ate. The interment will take place at Odd
Fellows' Cemetery.
The young King will transfer the camp
to another locality in the vicinity soon
after the funeral.

THEIR BURST OF TALENT.
High School Girls Come Out As
Writers and Illustra
tors.
DRAW PICTURES FOR A BOOK.
Miss Emily Pitchfield and Her Friends
Make Clever Cartoons and
Sketches
The Girls' High School has suddenly de
veloped a burst of literary and artistic
talent that very few people would expect
to find lurking in the brains and lingers of
maidens of bashful fifteen and sweet six
teen.
All the talent was accidentally discov
ered, so to speak, by a desire on the part
One of Miss Emily Pitchficld's Illustrations for the Girls' High School French Play.
of the girls to possess a French library.
There are about 150 girls in the French
class and there is not a single book in the
library for those who are studious enough
to wane to get acquainted with French
classics. Miss Narjot Howard, the in
structor in French, suggested that the
girls should get up an entertainment to
raise a French book fund, and she threw
off the suggestion, without much hope that
it would be taken up, that if there were
any mute, inglorious Molierea or Racines
among the students the time had arrived
to be heafd from.
Miss Mattie Ijams, a lfi-year-old maiden,
took tbis hint au grand serieux, and with
out making any fuss about it she set to
work to write a" French play. She had rrot
any particular passion for the theater, but
she loved the study of French and did not
consider it any hardship to thumb the
dictionary to rags to seek out words that
rhyme.
The first surprise to the instructors who
do not expect to find playwrights and il
lustrators among high-school girls came
when Miss Mattie Ijams handed hi her
play. It was found to be not only in good
French, Dut was also a clever piece of
dramatic construction. Miss Ijams called
her work by a name that may be freely
translated by "Those Plagued Verbs."
The story depicts the persecution and sub
sequent triumph of a charming American
girl who is annoyed by a lot of animated
verbs that are dressed in red and have all
the outward and visible appearance of a
party of hieh-school girls.
The verbs have to dance and sing, and
as the poetry put into their mouth 3 was
found to be clever Mrs. yon Meyerinck set
it to music and Miss Ijanis' play was
ready to be ''staged."
It was at this point in the proceedings
that the art class began to bestir itself.
Under the direction of Professor Goldstein
the members of the art class are trans
forming themselves into scenic artists,
illustrators and cartoonists at a rate which
is astonishing every one. Very soon the
town will be adorned with art cartoons
worthy of Beardsly announcine that on
April 17 a French play will be eiven intfte
auditorium cf the Girls' High School, and
when that eventful day arrives the audi
ence will find that the scenic artists of the
Girls' High School and the modistes and
milliners of the same institution are as
able to stage a play as Frederick Warde
himself.
Another feature of the performance will
be the sale of books or the words, in
French and English. Some charming
illustrations of those terrible verbs are be
ing made by the students of the art class.
Miss Emily Pitclrfeld is the chief illus
trator, and she is assisted by such an able
corps of High School artists that it is ex
pected that the "book of the words will be
almost as much a thing of beauty as Mr.
Searles' new album.

man of the Reliance Club in the hfth to
2:14 l-5.RThe men did not appear to be
riding particularly fast either, but the
track is so well banked arid constructed it
almost makes them ride in record time.
Edwards also got the world's two-mile rec
ord in the first heat of that race, bringing
it down to 4:50..
Besides all the prominent men in local
wheeling circles the meet is drawing the
enthusiasts from all the nearby cities.
President Wickersham of the Petaluma
"Wheelmen is in nightly attendance, . and
Otto Ziegler Jr., the champion of the Na
tional racing circuit of 1894, with his
trainer, Foster, came up yesterday from
San Jose, accompanied by Secretary Pol
lard of the Garden City Cyclers. C. R.
Coulter, the crack Eastern class B man
â who made such a splendid showing last
year, was also there and took a great in
terest in the events. The Terriil brothers,
Harry F. and William A., of the Bay City j
"Wheelmen, both crack riders, have just re
turned from the East and may be seen in
the races next week when they have had a
chance to rest and train a little.
The gate prize offered by the manage
ment each night of the tournament, a high
grade bicycle, was won by ticket 1631 last
night. The lucky person holding this
ticket can secure the wheel by calling at
the box office any time, and can have the j
choice of a dozen makes, either a lady's or i
gentleman's wheel.
The first race on the evening pro
gramme was a one-mile handicap, which
was divided into twelve heats, three semi- ;
finals and a final, owing to the immense
number of entrants. j
The first heat was contested by P. R. J
Mott Reliance; A. Theison, California; G. j
E Frost unattached, and J. F. Burns, Im- j
perial.' Mott made a pretty ride and tin- j

tested the second heat. The race was be
tween Day and Edwards, and the latter .
proved the better man, winning from
scratch in 2:15 4-5. This time was an
nouncea as a world's record being the
fastest mile ever ridden on an indoor track. |
In the third heat the starters were: .V

In the seventh heat were A. L. Holling,
Bay City; E. H. Ward, Y. M. C. A. ; T. N.
Ihomas, Alameda; T. S. Hall, Bay City ;
A. B, Cumbers, Diamond; M. M. Cook,
Imperial, and A. Young, unattached.
Ihis was a well-contested race, and cook
and Mali had it out down the homestretch
neck and neck, the former winnine by the
aid of his 100-yard handicap in 2:17 4-5.
A speedy lot took their places for the
eighth heat. They were A. J. Menr.eand
E. Languetin, Bay City; A. If. Boyelen,
Reliance; F. L. Th'iel and H. Gunderson,
San Francisco Road Club; A. Grogi, Im
perial. Languetin, with the smallest
handicap of the lot, 50 yards, took first
place away from Boyden" and Thiel right
at the tape in 2:17 3-5.
In the ninth heat were A. H. Agnew
and G. H. Crafts, Acme; P. Morrin and P.
Metcalf, Imperial, and L. F. Pels, San
Francisco Road Club. They were all
nicely bunched at the end of the fourth
lap. "The two Imperial men paced each
other the rest of the way, Metcalf winning
from sixty-five yards in 2:17.
L. Young and J. H. Lynch, Imperial;
C. Goodwin, San Francisco Road Club;
W. T. Pratt, Alame.ia, and Tony Delmay,
Garden City, started in the tenth heat.
The knowing ones said the heat lay be
tween Goodwin and Dilmas, but it proved
to be Delmas and Pratt, who finished in
the older named. Delmas' handicap was
seventy yards and his time 2:18 1-5.
In the eleventh were C. A. Roemer, unat
tached ; C. If. Smith, Garden City; J. T.
Lynch, Imperial, and George W. Tantau,
Olympic. Every one said it lay between
Smith and Tantau, but the former lost a
pedal ana was out of it, which left it easy
for Tantau, who won aÂ« he pleased in
2:22 4-5 from forty-five yards.
In the twelfth and last heat the starters
were: G. A. McKay and H. B. Freeman,
Bay City; Ed Chapman. Olympic, and R.
C Gilbert, imperial. Chapman jumped
the bunch at the end of the seventh lap
I and won, with several wheels' length to
spare, from seventy yards in 2-20 3-5. Then
' it was the Olympic Wheelmen's turn to
jell, and they did it with a fengeance.
Before the semi-tinals and final of the
mile handicap were run off the heat? of
the two-mile scratch were run, four in
number. The starters in the first -vere
Edwards, Olympic; Leavitt, San Francisco
Road Club; Yeoman, Reliance, and Al
borelle, Imperial. At the end of the first
mile the time was 2:35 and Edwards was
leading. Leavitt dropped out during the
second mile, Alborelle fell back, leaving
Yeoman and Edwar is to fight it out. The
former had the pole, but Edwards passed
him on the last lap and won amid great
j applause in 4:50. Edwards is fast becom-
I ing very popular with the public on ae
j count of his fast and game riding, and
j when Announcer Knapp stated that the
time he made was another world's record
the crowd went wild with enthusiasm.
Three Bay City crackaiacks started in
the second heat, C. S. Wells, T. A. Grif
fiths and A. J. Menne. Though all belong
i ing to the same club they fought out the
{ race in friendly rivalry and made fast time.
The first mile was negotiated in 2:31,
Menne leading. Wells went to the front
on the second lap of the last mile and kept
it up to the bell lap. They all then sprinted
lor home and Wells kept his place, win
ning in 4 :56 2-5.
In the third heat there were four starters,
Goodwin, San Francisco Road Club; Tan
tau, Olympic; C. M. Smith, Garden City,
and Byrne, Imperial. As there is consid
erablerivalry for supremacy between all
four men a hot race resulted. The time
for the fir.-t mile was 2:35 3-5. A terrific
I sprint was started at the commencement
of the last lap, and Smith led for half the
i lap with Byrne second, but Tantau came
up on the outside with a big rush
and won out from both of them in 5:05 2-5.
It was a very popular victory, and he was
' roundly applauded.
The first semi-final of the one-mile hand
\ icap was then run off, those who had quali
! lied in their heats being Vincent, Bay
Ci'.y; Delmas, Garden City; Cook and
Langer, Imperial, and Chapman, Olympic.
Vincent seemed to have no trouble in win
ning from sixty-five yards, his time being
2:13 3-5, with Delmas second.
In the second semi-final were Lefevre,
Acme; Metcalf. Imperial; Edwards,
| Olympic, and Geoch, Reliance. The way
I Edwards started out from the scratch
mark to overtake the leaders seemed to
insure another lowered record and he
came within a second of it. winning the
heat with several yards to spare in 2:16.
Had he not been tired from his previous
efforts he would certainly have made it
under Yeoman's record of 2:14 1-5.
Four cracks competed in the third â
Mott. Reliance; Tantau, Olympic; Barley,
Imperial, and Lanj;uetin, Bay City. In a
pretty finish Tantau won from Languetin
in 2:23 3-5, from forty-five yards handicap.
After an intermission of fifteen minntes,
to give the riders an opportunity to rest,
the final heat of the two-mile scratch was
run off. Those who had qualified in their
heats were J. E. Edwards and George Tan
tau, Olympic, and C. S. Wells, Bay City.
Tantau, however, did not start, and Wells
and Edwards lined up for what proved one
of the greatest events of the evening. They
made a slow ride of the first mile, exchang
ing pace, and covering the distance in 2:41.
Wells assumed the lead on the fifth lap
of the second mile and kept it for the rest j
of the way, with Edwards hanging on close j
behind and fighting every inch of the way.
They made a beautiful sprint on the last
lap, side by side all the way, and it was
only by a" few inches that Wells won out
at the tape. The time was 5:00.
The final of the mile handicap was the
next event, those who had qualified in the
semi-finals being Vincent, Bay City, Tan
tau, Olympic, and Metcalf, Imperial. Ed
wards qualified for this race but did not
ride, as he had just come off the track
from the previous one. The race proved
one of the surprises of the evening. The
men were hunched by the fifth lap, and
loafed a little until the seventh, when a
grand sprint resulted in a victory for Vin
cent, with Metcalf second, Tantau third.
The time was 2:30 1-5, Vincent having a
handicap of 65 yards.
This made the second race won by a
Bay City rider during the evening, and the
club members and their friends made the
air ring with the club's yell and their ap
plause. For several minutes after the
race was over the noice was deafening, and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 7, 1896.
was only quieted when Announcer Knapp
went to his speaking-trumpet to announce
the next race, the ten-mile club cup event,
upon which Referee Welch placed a time
limit of 26 minutes. .
The entrants in this race last nignt,
which is one of the features of the meet
every evening, : were: L. :S. Leavitt, San
Francisco Road Club; F.M. Byrne, impe
rial ; C. .A. Parks, Alameda, and F. C.
Hansen. California. The riders started
out at a lively gait from the start, covering
the : first mile in 2:31. Two miles
were made in 5:09, three : 7:40 3-5,
four 10:12 3-5. five 12:55 and six 15:36. Up
to this time the men had ridden the race a
minute faster than the same race was cov
ered in Thursday night. At the end of the
seventh - lap the time was 18:15 4-5, and
still the pace grew faster. The eight miles
were made in 21:02; nine in 23:49 3-5.
Byrne had the lead at the beginning of the
last mile with the others ri ht up behind
him. As the sixth lap was pass d they all
sprinted tor home, Byrne still leading with
the others contesting every inch with him.
They came up the stretch four abreast,
Leavitt on the inside, Byrne next and the
others alongside. Leavitt "yon by a couple
of inches -in 26:26 and Byrne was only an
inch or two back of him. It was by far
the closest finish of the evening and ex
cited the audience to wild enthusiasm.

F. Ed Spooner, the Eastern cycling cor
respondent, and John Palmer, a manu
facturer of tices, arrived in the City late in
the evening and reached the track in time
to see the last half of the eveninc's enter
tainment. Spooner, who has probably at
tended more bicycle meets than any man
living, said it was the finest indoor track,
the biggest crowd and the best conducted
race meeting he had seen in years. He
was not surprised that two world's records
had been broken on such a track, consider
ing the high-ciass men who were racing,
and predicted before the tournament was
over many more records would fall.
There will be racing at the track both
this afternoon and this evening. The
matinee events will be a mile novice, two
mile Oriental scratch, and another of those
exciting mile handicaps. The evening
programme consists of a mile post race,
mile scratch, mile Oriental handicap and
the third heat of the great ten-mile club
cup race, which has proven thus far the
best event of the meet.
The great five-mile military relay race
will be contested Monday evening. The
men who will take part are: Sergeant H.
Austin and Privates H. Schurr, j. J. Don
nelly, G. Barklev, A. Ziegler, of Battery
H, Fifth United States Artillery; Private's
J. Fernandez ard J. F. Keilty of Troop X,
Fourth United States Cavalry ; Privates T.

of the Fourth Cavalry.
HE MAY LOSE HIS FEES
City and County Surveyor Til
ton's â¢ Compensation Is
Under Fire.
Attorney Creswell Claims That He
Must Keep to His Regular
Salary. '
In the opinion of City and County At
torney ' Creswell City Surveyor Tilton is
only entitled, to . receive the $500 per
year salary which the law allows him in
return for the services he renders the City
and County in calculating grades, etc.
Mr. Creswell submitted a long opinion on
the subject yesterday in answer to a query
from the .Board :..; of Supervisors ;as; to
whether Mr. Tilton was entitled to com
pensation for establishing grades south of
the park. The opinion in a condensed
form is as follows: .
The joint Committee on Streets and Judici
ary of the Board of Supervisors have under
consideration a resolution of which the follow
ing is a copy:
Retoived, That the Committee on Streets and
Wharves be and is hereby empowered and re
quired to contract at once with the City Engin
eer of this City and County to run all the lines
and levels, to establish all necessary bench
marks and set all necessary stone monuments
so that the grades and lines can be perpetu
ated, to prepare all n.aj>Â«, plans ana detail
drawings, to make all necessary computations
for size of sewers, to determine an outlet for
same and for recommending a system of grades
and sewers in the district or tract of land de
scribed in resolution No. 12,509 (third series)
of this board, at a cost of $11,000.
The resolution was referred to the City and
County Attorney with a request that his
opinion be given on the authority of the board
to Authorize said expenditure. The opinion
has been tivea holding that no such contract
could be mad--' with the City and County Sur
veyor for the work mentioned in the oroposed
resolution. A City Engineer is provided for in i
the act of 1895, commonly called the Vroomau
act. This act permits the Boird-of Supervisors
to order the whole or any portion, either in
length or width of streets, avenues, lanes,
alley*, courts, or places of any city graded or
regradcd to the official grade, planked or re
planked, paved or repaved, macadamized or re
macadatnized, graveled or regraveled, piled
or repiled, capped or recapped, sewered or re
sewered, etc.
This act, in section 3, requires the City En
gineer to furnish plans and specifications and
careful estimates of the cost and expenses of
the work, which is an incidental expense and
must be paid by the per?on to whom the con
tract shall be awarded, and by him collected
from the property-owners. ]f the work should
be abandoned before the contract is let section
5 requires the board to pay the City Engineer
the cost of the work done by him.
The board may under section 20 order tho
whole or any part of the work mentioned in
section 2 paid by the City. The work proposed
in the resolution before the Supervisors is not
provided for by the Vrooman act, consequently
no charge can be made against the City for it,
because the only charge that can be made
aeainst the City by the City Engineer must be
for work dene under the act as provided in
sections 5 and 26.
The City and County Surveyor cannot make
a charge for the work, because under section
10 of the consolidation act and the act of the
Legislature of May 17, 1881, the annual salary
paid him by the City is declarea to be by the
law full compensation for all work done by
him for the City, and section 10 of the consoli
dation act makes it unlawful to pay any of the
officers of the City and County any extra com
pensation for their services. Independent of
the consolidation act the courts hold it illegal
to pay extra compensation for official services.
If this opinion is upheld Surveyor Tilton
will be deprived of several thousand dol
lars annually in fees.
Charges Against Lane.
Judge Wallace has notified the' District At
torney that under the law Peter F. Lane can
not be convicted of the charge against him.
There are several charges pending against
Lane, some cf which are before Judge Wallace.
Under the recent testimony it has been de
cided that aconvictlon cannot be scoured and
it Is therefore probable that all the felony
charges will be reduced to misdemeanors.
CHANGES IN COMMITTEE
Four Members of the Republican
County Organization
Resign.
AN ARMISTICE DECLARED.
The Rival Factions Agree to Defer
Action Until Next Thursday
Night.
The most important political develop
ments of yesterday concerned the Repub
lican affairs of the Fourth and Fifth Con
gressional Districts.
An armistice was agreed to by the repre
sentatives of all the Republican factions at
a meeting of the executive committe of the
State Central Committee, held at 419 Cali
fornia street.
In accordance with that agreement it is
not likely that any action will be taken by
either of the rival Fourth District com
mittees or, for that matter, by the Fifth
District committee before that time. The
leaders of the factions that have appeared
in the local Republican party have as
sented to a truce that promises a united
Republican party in thecomimg campaign
and John D. Bpreckels has been one of tne
leading spirits in the work which has
effected this armistice.
When the executive committee met a
majority of the members were present.
When tlie meeting came to order in re
sponse to the call of Chairman P. B. Corn
wall there were present the following
members:
P. B. Cornwall, J. D. Spreckels, Wendell
Easton, Isaac I'phani, J. H. Mahonev, W.
W. Montague, Leon Denneiy, W. C. John
son, David Kerr, Asa R. Wells, W. C. Pal
i meri, M. Cooney, A. Ruef, Frank Mc-
Quaid, James McNab, H. C. Sonntag and
J. C. Daly.
The proceedings all looked in harmony
and the net result of the meeting was a
general agreement by all who could go so
I far as to pledge their influence in behalf
j of the rival committees in the Fourth Dis
trict that no definite proceedings should
be taken by any Congressional district
committee or organization until the next
meeting of the executive committee, of
State Central Committee, which will occur
next Thursday evening according to ad
j journment.
One of the first questions that came up
for the consideration of the committee was
the history of the call issued by the State
Committee last Saturday afternoon. This
call, which provided for district conven
tions, introduced an innovation.
Congressional district conventions in
charge of primary elections had never be
fore been heard of, and the elaboration
ana an explanation of how this new
j scheme came to be presented by the ex
ecutive committee and by default and
without discussion or explanation adopted
by the State Committee was one of the
early features of the discussion.
It" was explained by J. C. Daly and
others that the call, prepared, adopted and
referred to the judiciary committee at the
meeting on the Tuesday preceding
the meeting of the State Cen
tral Committee, was prepared without
appreciation of the new feature introduced
into the call of this year, and that the
paragraph calling for Congressional dis
trict conventions was a discovery made
just prior to the meeting of the State
Central Committee;
The complications in the Fourth and
Fifth districts were the main topic of the
meeting, of course, and the truce regarding
the affairs of those districts was the net
result.
The State Central Committee is com
posed of representatives of the various
districts, elected in the regular manner,
and also of an executive committee
chosen at large and on general principles.
Judge Cooney early brought up the ques
tion of whether or not the members of the
Fourth and Fifth Congressional districts
had a right to participate in the election
of members of the now Congressional
committees. A truce was declared on this
point also.
A. Ruef insisted that only the member*
elected from the respective districts had
any voice and vote, and he spoke strongly
in "the interest of fairness and harmony.
The discussion then turned on the
question of the meaning and effect of
the amendment of Wells of Contra Costa
County to the resolution of Mr. Sheldon
of Los Angeles providing for the cre
ation of Congressional district committees
by members of the State Central Com
! mittee; and it was mainly the doubts
concerning the effect of that resolution on
the powers of Congressional committees
which occasioned the adjournment.
Meantime the members of tbe
regular Fourth Congressional commit
tee will probably await developments.
They believe in the regularity of their
appointment and are ready to take up
their oflicial duties as the interest of the
party demands.
C. C. Bemis, found in his Montgomery
street real estate office, said: "This is a
Republican year, and for that very reason
| the importance of clean politics and the
judicious selection of candidates is greater
than ever. When there is doubt about
results and a reasonable certainty of de
feat, it does not so much matter whom the
party puts in nomination. But this year
! is a Republican year. Therefore, we want
j to pick a man for the nomination for Con
: gress, for instance, whom we can send to
Washington with confidence that he will
do something for the State of California.
That is the important business that is
now to be undertaken by Republicans. I
shall accept my appointment to the com
mittee of the Fourth Congressional Dis
trict, of course. The committee brought
into existence through the means of a
forged proxy will not be considered as
! having any legal existence."
C. B. Rode was confined to his home
yesterday by an attack of rheumatism.
When seen he said : '"I was not asked con
cerning my appointment. I am a very
busy man, and so far from seeking this
honor 1 would rather avoid it. But I have
been selected, and consider it my duty at
this time to get in and do what I can for
good government and clean politics. So I
will accept. I have seen no other mem
bers of the committee, as I have been un
able to get out, but I learn its composition
from The Call. They are all good men,
and will do what they have to do openly
and honestly. What we want is decent
methods, a fair ballot in the primaries and
in the convention as well as at the general
election, and we must have it."
Nicholas Ohiandt said : "Of course I shall
accept the appointment to the Congres
sional committee of the Fourth District.
With another committee in the held ap
pointed by fraud and having a purpose, it
may be presumed, to commit other frauds,
it is hardly the time to shirk responsibili
ties. Sure, I will accept and work with
tiie committee to relegate bribery and
Buckley methods to the rear."
Four Resigned.
Four members of the Republican County
Committee resigned at the meeting last
evening held in Shiels hall. They were
C. C. Morris of the Thirty-eighth Assem
bly District, Ambrose A. Watson of the
Forty-third Assembly District, Thomas
McDermott of the Twenty-ninth and P. H.
Prendergast of the Thirty-first districts.
In their places were elected Grove L.
Ayers of the Thirty-eighth District, P. J.
Walsh of the Forty-third, John N. Brown
ing of the Twenty-ninth and Charles Clare
of the Thirtv-tirst.
A Cat's Funeral as Conducted by a Dog.
"Every one has observed instances of
affection between those proverbially hos
tile animals, the dog and the cat,'' says
the American Nnturalist (February), "but
a case cited by l'Eleveur merits especial
attention. A dog and a cat belonging to
the same master wore the best friends in
the world and spent their time in frolick
ing together. One day, while playing as
usual, the cat died suddenly, falling at the
dog's feet. The latter at first did not
realize what had happened, but continued
his play, pulling, pushing and carressing
his companion, but with evident astonish
ment at her inertness. After some
time he appeared to understand the
situation, and his grief found vent in pro
longed howls. Presently he was seized
with the idea of buiying the cat. He
pulled her into the garden, where he soon
dug a hole and put in it the body of his
former companion. He then refilled the
hole with dirt, and, stretching himself
out on the grave, resumed his mournful
howling. The idea of burying the dead
cat was extraordinary. VV hence came
the thought? Could it be imitation, or,
which is a better explanation, did the dog
have a vague idea of concealing the event
which might possibly be imputed to him?
But then it would seem unreasonable for
him to call attention to the fact by in
stalling himself on the grave and howling.
However, human criminals are often
equally inconsistent. It is difficult to
form an exact idea of what gave rise to the
dog's conduct in this case."

spondent of the influential German daily,
Frankfurter Zeitung, who has been travel
ing in China, Japan, Korea and other
countries and matting a special study of
the Eastern question for the paat six
months, is at the Palace.
Dr. Kanner is one of the best-known
journalists in Europe. He was formerly
correspondent of the Bulgarian Times,
published in Sofia, and it waÂ« he who ob
tained the interview with Starobouloff
which so offended Prince Ferdinand.
He is also the editor of the Weekly
Vienna Die Zeit. Dr. Kanner has been in
terviewing Li Hung Chang and other fa
mous men of the East. He thinks Russia
has a long way the best of it. so far as the
Eastern question is concerned.
To his mind the Russians are the great
est diplomats in the world. He says Japan
has shown that she could tight, and has in
that way gained standing and glory for
herself; but Russia, whicn did no tight
ing, and only stood by till it was all over,
has got everything except Formosa and
the moneyed consideration which China
gave Japan.
"She got the Lao Tung peninsula," said
Dr. Kanner, "and Korea, fo r wnosd inde
pendence Japan was lighting, aside from
her own minor interests, Russia controls
instead of China. It is Russian intrigue
that has caused the recent murders in
Seoul. The King of Korea, instead of be
ing a king, is a miserable old woman â
mere putty in the hands of the Russian
intriguers.
"The Ministers in Korea who have been
favorable to Japan have been put out of
office and others favorable to Russia have
been put in. 1 have no idea that Russia
for a moment wants Korea. That would
simply put her in trouble with other
nations to hold her position there. All
she wants to do is to keep Japan off the
continent of Asia. Siie wants to contine
her to the islands.
"That is why Russia insisted that Japan
let go <>f the Lao Tung peninsula. Japan
lost that and control over Korea, and
while she got an indemnity of 350,000.000
yen the cost of her war was 225,000,000
yen. So it might be asked what good it
did Japan anyway, and it may be replied,
as was stated before, that she got simply
some glory and a better standing with the
nations of the world.
"Russia has an agent in Korea.'and in
Japan as Envoy and Minister, with resi
dence at Tokio, is the noted Russian,
Hitrovo, one of tbe most accomplished
diplomats in the world, who is credited
with causing all the trouble in Bulgaria a
few years ago. Personally he is one of tbe
most affable ana charming of men.
"It is believed throughout Japan and
China that the agent of the Russian Gov
ernment in Korea is under the direct con
trol of Hitrovo, and that they are in
triguing together for Russia."
Dr. Kanner will remain in America only
about a month. He was in this coun
try during the World's Fair. He will
return here in October and study the
political campaign.
The Zeitung, which he represents, is
published at Frankfort-on-the-Main, and
though it has but 180,000 inhabitants, the
paper is one of the most influential politi
cally and commercially in all Germanj. It
circulates among the higher classes.
It has, through long years and the exer
cise of great care, attained a reputation
for accuracy second probably to no paper
in Europe. The Zeitung is like the Bible
to its readers. Strange as it may appeal,
its circulation is but 40,000. The paper is
sold for ft pfenig (or about 1% cents), a
gum equal to 5 cents here.
THE BABY'S VANISHMENT
Charges and Counter Charges
Made by Papa and Mamma
Marceau.
A Love for Wine on One Hand and
Intoxication on the
Other.
The Marceau baby has gone from the
Palace Hotel, but the mother is silent as
to ihe method of its vanishment.
Both parents of the child are seekinpr a
divorce, and in the language of the detec
tives have been keeping cases on each
other for some time. The baby was the
sensational bone of contention, as events
at the Palace Thursday night proved, and
developments of a startling character are
expected.
Mrs. Marceau refused positively to be
interviewed. All inquiries after the wel
fare of Baby Marceau and its mother's fu
ture purposes were met with a peremptory
refusal to be quizzed. All comers were re
ferred to her lawyers, Messrs. Dunne &
McPike. During the short conversation
accorded the reporter Mrs. Marceau let it
be known that she deemed it a gross insult
to her position and reputation that such
publicity should have been given to the
discraceful scene enacted in her apart
merits in the Palace Hotel Thursday night.
Mr. McPike had also developed a disin
clination for converse with representa
tives of the press. He characterized the
proceedings of Colonel Marceau as brutal.
In contravention of the colonel's allega
io ns Mrs. Marceau asserts that she has
been subjected to the most brutal treat
ment. She says that he was in the habit
of getting intoxicated and subjecting her
to the most humiliating treatment.
The colonel has something to say about
the free and unlimited use of intoxicants
in the domestic circle. In the plainest of
Slain language the colonel asseverates that
rs. Marceau gets drunk. The red, red
wine has an overpowering fascination for'
her, and the resultant condition is not such
as to insure the colonel's perpetual peace
and domestic felicity.
MARSICK IS APPLAUDED
The Violinist's Second Recital
Here Draws a Good
House.
ASSISTED BY LOCAL TALENT.
Sauvlet Plays in the Kreutzer So
nataâDonald de V. Graham
Sings.
Marsick was greeted last night by an
audience that more than two-thirds filled
the California Theater. The violinist was
assisted by Donald de V. Graham, bary
tone; Sauvlet, pianist, and Mrs. N. J. Hin
richs, accompanist.
It would^ be a mistake to say that there
was any fervid amount of enthusiasm.
The audience was keenly appreciative and
showed its enjoyment of the star's ex
quisitely finished and artistic playing by
warm applause.
Excellent srtist as Carsick is, however,
he does not possess the magnetic force and
the dominating personality which give
some rare musicians, such as Paderewski
or Ysaye, the power to sway the musical
multitude with an almost hypnotic force.
People applaud MarsieK because their in
tellect admires his art, not because their
pulses thrill to his music.
The opening number last night was the
"Kreutzer Sonata." Sauvlet was the pian
ist, and he did knight's work in entering
into Marsick's interpretation of the com
position, which was a somewhat delicate
interpretation, but lacking in imssion,
which some more virile violinists put into
the final presto especially.
Vieuxtemp3* "Fantasia appassionata"
showed the violinist's exquisite camabile,
as well as his finished technical skill. His
whole performance of the work made one
think of the singing of those rapidly dis
appearing liquid sopranos of the old Ital
ian school, to whom the most florid
norature of Rossini or Bellini were mere
child's play. Delightfully finished and
easy that singing was, but there were less
soul and feeling in it than in the rougher
singing of some modern artists. To a cer
tain extent the same remark applies to
Marsick's playing of the aupassionata.
There were two Marsick compositions,
one called a "Dream" and the other
"Joking" (Scherzando). They were both
pretty and effective, particularly the lat
ter, and Marsick played them well, but
neither rose above the level of the com
monplace. Tne "Czardas," by Hubay, was
played with considerable verve and aroused
a determined demand for an encore, to
which tlie violinist responded by playing
a '"Romance" of his own composition,
which was a more ambitious and taking
work than the two previous pieces of his
own that he had played.
Two numbers of the "Suite Tzigani" by
A. Wormse finished the programme.
They were brilliantly played and made
people loath to leave the theater without
an encore, but though Marsick came on to
bow several times he did not play ajjain.
Donald de V. Graham, the violinist,
sang in his usual agreeable and finished
manner. He is also heard to best advan
tage in French, and Tschaikowsky's
"Serenade to Don Juan" was charm
ingly sung in that language last night.
The solo, "It Was Not Thus to Be,"
from the "Trompeter yon Sackingen," de
mands more vim than Mr. Graham
possesses, but he sang the air so cleveriy
as almo3t to conceal the fact. Botli Mr.
Graham's songs were encored. Mrs. N.
J. Hinrichs accompanied ably.
Marsick's last concert will take place to
morrow evening at the Baldwin Theater.
HABSICK'S LAST COXCEKT.

the capable conductorship of August

THEY SAIL IN BALLAST.
Very Little Freight Now for the
Trans-Pacific Steam
ers.
The Doric's Maiden Trip With but
500 Tonsâ Fares Cut by the
Canadian Line.
The Pacific Mail Company is in a quan
dary over its business with China and
Japan, all because of the loss of business
in face of an increase in ships for the
trans-Pacific trade. Its twin company,
the Occidental and Oriental, which is un
derstood to be practically the "Pacific
Mail," and is managed from the same
office largely under Southern Pacific in
fluences, suffers also.
The Occidental and Oriental Company
only recently chartered a new steamer
from the White Star line â the Doric -and
put her into commission a few days ago.
People who took any interest in shipping
had an opportunity of admiring the grace
ful and stately Doric as she lay in the har
bor at Lombard-street wharf, indeed, she
was spoken of on all sides with words of
admiration, and great things were expected
for her. Nobody felt more deeply im
pressed on this score than did the Pacific
Mail officials.
And the Doric waited in calm dignity
for the cargo that never came. Large con
si gnments of cotton were looked for from
the South, but for some reason the South
ern Pacific did not receive a call for trains,
nor did the Mail Company by Panama re
ceive a shipment The cotton did not
come, and it is now stated, because former
shipments for the Orient were neglected
by the Pacific Mail and allowed to lie
upon the dock or in stores, although badly
needed in the Japanese mills.
But the trouble was not confined to cot
ton alone, for all other clases of freight
were quite as scarce.
"The Doric sailed for the Orient,"' said
an officer of the Mail Company yesterday,
"with a cargo of sand and pigiron. They
found that pieces of the hills near the
water front came in very conveniently to
ballast the snip. In all, she had about 500
tons of cargo (the re3t was ballast), whereas
she ought to have had at least 2000 tons.
It was the same story with the steamer
that sailed before she did. There was cot
ton from Texas or down South, but it never
came, and then little, or almost nothing,
was left for cargo.
"The truth is the Canadian steamers are
taking the best of the business away from
the Pacific Mail. Nor is the lost business
freight alone, but passengers as well. The
fare for a first-class passenger to the
Orient used to be $300. The Canadian line
made a lower rate, and the Pacific Mail
h3s had to come down to $200 â a loss of
$100 on each passenger. Chinese used to
pay $100 for the passage, but the Cana
dians cut that down, and the Mail Com
pany had to follow suit by splitting their
old rate in two.
"Now Chinese can cross the ocean for
$50. A steamer took out 1400 Chinese,
who were going home for their New Year.
Now that means at the reduced rate a loss
of $7000 on one trip ulone, and, as those
fellows return, it means another loss of
$7000, or $14,000 on a single round trip of
one steamer. That is only a case in point,
but it gives you an iaea of how the Mail
Company is situated."
The Chinese are fond of eggs about 100
years old. and old eggs are worth about as
much in China as old wine is in other
countries. They have a way of burying
the eggs, and it takes about thirty days to
render a pickled egg lit to eat. Some of
the old eggs have become as black as ink,
and one ot the favorite Chinese dishes for
invalids is made up of eggs which are pre
served in jars of red clay and salt water.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Says Mr. Mahoney to Mr. Kelly, "Wot
tell."
The meeting at the .Baldwin was not
lucky.
It was a Fitzsimnions lick in the Fourth
District.
Honest politics is no new broom, but it
can sweep clean.
Mr. Huntinscton must either sharpen
bis old tools or get new ones.
Spain and Italy might as well agree to
help one another turn loose.
Wherever the tricksters are thickest is
the place to make the cleanest sweep.
Under the impulse of the right move
ment things are talcing the right shape.
Democratic Congressmen no longer de
fend Cleveland, but they still yelp wnen he
is hit.
Local politics at present is hot only at
one end and that is the end Mr. Kelly got
hold of.
In agreeing to compromise on the Cuban
resolutions, the Senate has compromised
the whole question.
By this time Mr. Cleveland has learned
that his speech on home missions was for
eign to the subject.
It won't be long now before the political
coyote can be known by his howl as he
takes to the woods.
Republicans of every county in the State
are interested in the contest for local con
trol of local politics.
The attemct to steal the Republican or
ganization was made by a hog combine,
but the hog is dead.
Spanish students are at liberty to hnrl
defiance at our august Senate, but they
mustn't muss up our nag.
It is worth noting that the Abyssinians
are not asking any foreign country to
recognize their independence.
The Southern Pacific machine is as ter
rible looking as ever, but the power that
moves it is weakening every day.
In their eagerness to see what was in the
Southern Pacific sack, the blundering
tricksters let the cat out of the bag.
It seems the tricksters of the railroad
not only forged a proxy, but by false pre
tenses got an innocent man to vote it.
The Italians have not learned the com
mon sense of not swapping horses while
crossing a stream and Crispi must go.
There may not be much glory in hunt
ing political coyotes out of the Republican
vineyard, but there is lots of fun in it.
It is through local organizations that the
Republican party has always acted, and
why should tue custom be changed now ?
The monopoly rascals may not have in
tended to steal anything, but what were
they doing iv the Republican hen roost?
The campaign has been very properly
opened by lifting the cover off and expos
ing the Southern Pacilic rat in the meal
tub.
It is natural that Cleveland should be
trying to gain time on the issues before
him, for there is nothing else left him to
gain.
Juat a few more steps in rascality are all
that is needed to land some of the big
tricksters of the Kentucky company in a
California prison.
Delegates who claim to represent the
Republican party in a State convention
nmst be elected by Republicans and not
appointed by a gang.
By winning the battle for purity in its
own ranks, the Republican party will as
sure the people of a pure aurninigtration
when it comes into power.
"Zip! I got him," said Mr. Mahoney
when he thought that Melsing's proxy was
a fly. "Zip! I let him co," is what he said
when he found it was a hornet.
Jacob Shaen denounces the scheme by
which he was induced to vote the fraudu
lent proxy of Gustave Melaing as "a dirty
trick," and that is exactly wh*t it was.
It will be well for Democrats to give an
interested attention to the vigor with which
the Republican party is drubbing the
monopoly rascals, for it intends to give
Democracy an equal drubbing a iittle later
on.
As a Republican victory is a certainty
this year every effort will be made by the
Southern Pacific of Kentucky to obtain
control of its organization, and loyal Re
publicans in every county must be on
Kuard.
It is by acting through local organiza
tions and giving every member of the
party an equal voice that the Republican
party maintains the great principle of a
government of the people by the people
for the people.
In the prospects of the Repblican party
there is at this time enough of danger to
rouse the courageous, enough of assurance
to encourage the least sanguine, enough of
greatness to excite the indifferent and
enough of honor to inspire the loyal with
a true enthusiasm.
PARTY HOME RULE.
The Congressional committees to whose
hands has been intrusted the election of
delegates to the Republican convention
can hardly be ignorant that the innova
tion thus made on the established customs
of the party has not been received with
much favor by the rank and file. The old
principle of local control of local affairs is
ingrained in the hearts of Americans and
none are more devoted to it than those
whose loyalty makes up- the strength and
the honor of the Republican party. These
men regard the innovation with no little
suspicion, and it devolves upon tne Con
gressional committees to act in such a
manner as will banish all fear of unfair
dealing and restore confidence to the party
throughout the State.
It will not be difficult for the Congres
sional committees to provide for the eiec
tion of delegates under conditions that
will be satisfactory to all loyal members of
the party. This can be effected by the
proper recognition of the local organiza
tions through which the members of t,he
party have been accustomed to carry on
tbt! party work. In those organizations
coming direct from the rank and tile of the
party and in close contact with them the
people have confidence. They will not be
so sure to have confidence in the commit
tees controlling the wide areas and large
populations of Congressional districts.
Moreover, even if they had an equal con
fidence in the fairness of the outside body
they would still prefer to have the man
agement of local affairs in the hands of
the local organization, for there is a nat-
Ural preference founded on good reasons
tor home rule in party politics as well aa
in anything else.
If any further reasons were needed why
the Congressional committees should re
solve to act through local organizations,
it would be found on the scores of economy
and effectiveness. These organizations
already exist. They have been long ac
customed to directing the affairs of the
party. It is to them the members of tfce
party in each locality look for notices of
all party work that is to be performed.
To ignore them and establish new centers
of political activity would certainly entail
considerable cost, and give rise to no little
confusion, as a result of which there would
surely be dissatisfaction for which the
party would suffer.
We urge the adoption of the practice of
home rule with the more earnestness, be
cause there has oeen disclosed in this City
unmistakable evidence of a conspiracy to
get control of the Congressional commit
tees and use them in the interests of the
Southern Pacific Company of Kentucky.
Men do not forge proxies, and by false
pretenses induce innocent men to use
them, unless they are impelled by base
motives. The story of the attempt made
at the Baldwin Hotel meeting to get con
trol of the Fourth District is now familiar
to the State and the people are watcnful
and suspicious. What was exposed and
baffled in one place may succeed in an
other. Loyal Republicans are taking no
chances this year. They demand honest
politics and local control of local elections.
AMAZING LOOSENESS.
Mayor Sutro made the astonishing
discovery the other day that a firni
of contractors for private street work
had tiled an assessment for $21,797 35
for a sewer along Lake street, from
Fourteentn to Twentieth avenue, in
Richmond district. No objection from the
property-owners accompanied the assess
ment, but the amount appeared bo large
that the Mayor notified the Riehmonl
Property-owners' Protective Association.
Mr. Hubbs, president of the association,
must have been astonished after making a
simple computation, for he discovered
that there are only six blocks to be sew
ered, that they are 240 feet each in length
and that the assessment represents a con
templated cost of $15 35 a front foot, where
as the ordinary price runs from $1 40 a
foot for pipe sewers to $3 a foot for brick.
The assessment of $15 35 is nearly half the
value of the property.
This should serve as ample warning to
property-owners in all parts of the City.
The official safeguards placed by law
around the making of assessments for
work to be done by private contract are
sufficient if faithful officers have charge of
their enforcement, but in the absence of
that protection it behooves property
owners to exercise the utmost diligence.
This can be best accomplibhed by commit
tees of citizens who may be depended on
to prevent wrongdoing. The South Side
improvement clubs have such committees,
and the good effect of their supervision is
expected to appear in the Folsom-street
improvement.
The Merchants' Association is now mov
ing for better pavements in the business
section, and has secured the promise of
the Street Superintendent's beany co-op
eration. It is to be hoped that the im
provement will be made, and we may be
pure that the shrewd and alert commit
tees which the association will place in
charge of the work will see that property
owners are not swindled or worthless im
provements made.
The present disgraceful condition of
affairs, with its long list of scandals which
have been recently unearthed by the Grand
Jury, are the direct result of turning over
the political machinery of the City to or
ganized bands of unscrupulous politicians.
It is ail of a piece with the disgraceful
manner in which the Market-street Rail
way Company, through the political man
agement of the Southern Pacific Company,
has secured valuable franchises for a song,
and been permitted without demur to vio
late the terms of their franchises and in
flict serious injuries on property at will.
Until this power is crushed it is useless to
expect an honest administration of all the
municipal departments.
WE CAN STAND IT.
Dispatches from Oienfuegos, Cuba, an
nounce anti-American demonstrations,
and the passage of resolutions by the
Chamber of Commerce of that city to the
effect that all orders outstanding for
American goods be canceled and that a
boycott be declared against all kinds of
American goods in the future.
This is the very height of folly. Cuba is
so torn with internal dissension, so warped
and twisted with civil war, and so threat
ened by the advance of the insurgents
upon Havana itself that it is incapable of
feeding its people. It must rely upon out
side sources of supply for food, and such
food supplies must come, naturally and
primarily, from the United States. The
Cienfuegos Chamber of Commerce may
think it has a grievance against the United
States, but when it comes to a hungry
people, when flour and meat and various
farm products become practically unpro
curable, the Doycott will not look so much
like a grand, glorious, patriotic act as it
does just now.
To toe United States such a boycott as
this is really too insignificant to cut any
figure. Under the so-called reciprocity
clause of the McKinley bill our trade with
Cuba increased very largely and was put
on a satisfactory basis, but when the Wil
son bill erased that wise and salutary pro
vision of law the trade dropped back to its
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 7, 1896.
formor status and became, as before,
hardly worth consideration It is safe to
say that to-day our trade with Cuba, that
is, our export trade, does not approach in
volume the interchange of domestic prod
ucts between almost any two of the great
States of the Union. For this reason it
can stand the boycott if Cuba can, but
such ill-advised action will certainly not
tend to make relations any more amicable
between the Spanish power in Cuba and
the United States than they are at present.
FOR TRUTH AND PAIRNESS.
The statement made by Dr. Brown on
Thursday before the church council that
of all the papers In the City The Call
only had given fair reports of the pro
ceedings and the evidence was public testi
mony to the fidelity with which The Call,
keeps its pledges to its readers of giving
full, accurate and unbiased report? of all
events of current interest.
It has been the ambition of the editor
of Tin: Call to make it a paper as eminent
for accuracy as for enterprise. Its motto
has been the truth and its aim has been to
find out the truth and publish it for the
information of the public. To do this it
has been necessary of course to be impar
tial in all controversies, to lay aside all
temptations toward sensationalism, to do
full justice to every man or woman on
trial whether popular or unpopular, and
in all events give every fact its due place
on the record without coloring, distortion
or misrepresentation of any kind.
It is gratifying to know that our efforts
in this respect have not been overlooked,
either by individuals whose deeds have
been inquired into, or by intelligent people
who read to learn the truth and not to
gratify a passion, a prejudice or an idle
curiosity. Dr. Brown is not the only per
son who has borne public testimony to
the accuracy and the fairness of The Call
Sooner or later this characteristic of the
paper will be universally recognized, and
it will occasion no comment when the fact
is stated either in public or in private.
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
The features prepared especially for to
morrow's Call are so numerous that it is
difficult to make a selection for mention
here. Among them will be a graphic pen
picture concerning Telegraph Hill, giving
its past history, its present condition and
its inevitable future. This question has
an important bearing on the development
of San Francisco's water front.
"How a Confederate Cruiser Was Cap
tured in San Francisco Harbor" Is the
title of an exciting episode of tbe Civil
War that will be news to many of the
present residents of the City.
"Horse-breeding on a Blue-grass Farm"
is an entertaining and instructive contri
bution, the material for which was fur
nished by Mrs. John M. Clay, the accom
plished widow of the son of Henry Clay.
W. C. Morrow contributes a strange and
immensely dramatic story concerning a
mysterious discovery in electricity.
Ninetta Eames contributes an account
of Luther Burbank of Santa Roaa, the
great plant specialist, who is known in
Europe as the "wizard of horticulture"
by reason of his great success in produc
ing new varieties of plants.
The regular departments of the Sunday

A THICK DENOUNCED.
A Condemnatory Editorial From an
Independent Journal.
Of all the newspapers that are generally
found defending the Southern Pacific it is
clear that there is one actuated by prin
ciple. The fearless, independent and in
dignant tone of the following editorial
from the San Francisco Wave is encour
aging to all men who take an interest in
political matters for the good of their
party and the welfare of the people:
THE VICTORY OF A TRICK.
There are some things that even a Re
publican State Central Committee cannot
with impunity attempt to do. It cannot
afford to stoop to low cunning and deceit;
it cannot afford to father brazen false
hoods; it cannot afford to open up a
Presidential campaign with a He upon its
lips, deceit within its heart and treachery
as its watchword. It cannot afford to do
these things upon the opening of a cam
paign, and at the same time hone to in
spire confidence abroad in the integrity of
its future undertakings. These unholy at
tributes belong not to State and National
politics. They are the offspring ajid crea
tures of the ward cluba in the foulest quar
ters of the City, and should have their
abiding-place only among the scum and
wreckage of political life. Certainly they
have no place in ' the central political or
ganization of a great National party.
We have not the slightest interest in the
political aspirations of Mr. Spreckels, nor,
for that matter, have we any interest in
any other faction or individnal of the Re
publican party. No party boss or party
lash shall direct our policy during the com
ing campaign, or deviate our course by a
hair's breadth from what we consider the
way of truth and honesty. It is our pur
pose to exercise in these columns the func
tions and prerogativesÂ«of an independent
American citizen; and we shall not hesi
tate to point out, even if found within the
ranks of the party whose ticket we may
support, the shortcomings, the wrongs
and evils which may there abide.
It is well known that the Snreckels seek
a place in the politics of California and it
is good that this is so. It is well that
men of means and leisure should be will*
ing to devote themselves to the welfare of
the country. To us it is a matter of utter
indifference what ambition may move Mr.
Spreckels to enter politics. His elevation
to political office would afflict us with no
pain. He is entitled to decent treatment,
and in the councils of his party is entitled
to bear the truth from the lips of his polit
ical associates when matters material to
the welfare of that party are at stake.
The wrong of which we complain was per
petuated at the initial meeting of the
Republican State Central Committee. As
is well known among politicians certain
county committeemen ure favorable to the
interests of Mr. Spreckles. His enemies
sought to strip him of the power that goes
with such political control. At the last
moment before the late meeting, be was
informed that in the official notice of the
Republican National Committee calling
for the convention at St. Louis, there bad
been embodied certain instructions as to
the methods to be employed in the several
States for the selection of delegates to that
convention. He was urged by hie asso
ciates to abide by the terms of the instruc
tions issued by his party, even though in
dividually injured. With the full knowl
edge that to do so would be to cripple his
political strength ; with the knowledge that
such a course would place in the hands of
the opposing political faction strength
which properly belonged to him ; with the
instincts of a true National Republican, he
cheerfully yielded his personal interest
for what he had been informed were the
wishes of the National party, as denned
by its National Committee. No one ques
tioned the motive impelling Mr. Spreckels
to this course. It was magnanimous, lovai
and decent; bnt what shall we say to the
miserable tricksters who have imposed
upon the credulity of the man and filled
his ears with falsehoods; and, with a lie
upon their lips, exacted from him a prom
ise that was prompted by the holiest and
most honest of political motives? The call
of the National Committee Bays:
'â¢The Congressional district delegates
shall be chosen at the convention called
by the Congressional committee of each of
such districts in the same manner as the
nomination of the Representative is made
in the same district."
The resolutions which Mr. Spreckels
waa induced by false representations to
support begin with the lying words, "'ld
accordance with the direction of the Re
publican Committee," and winds up with
an interpolation, unauthorized by the
committee, unmentioned in its call, un
thought of by its fathers, that strips from
Mr. Spreckels political power earned by
him, and to which he was rightfully en
titled had his associates been less indecent !
and deceitful. This infamous resolution
adopted by the State Central Committee,
while it seems to follow the call of the
National Committee, contains these words
in place of those above quoted :
"The selection of the delegates of the
Congressional conventions shall be under
the direction of the Congressional Com
mittee of each district, and all primaries
held for the election of delegates shall be 'â¢
held under the exclusive management and
control of the Congressional Committee."
Any politician reading these two sen
tences will, at a glance, discover where Mr.
Spreckels has been undone when it is
considered that friendly to bis interest
were a number of county comniltteemen
who, nnder the practice contemplated by
the National Conynittee, would have had
charge of the primaries for the election of
delegates. Under the instructions the
Congressional Committee waa to be given
the power of calling conventions, but there
is not one word declaring they should
have exclusive management or control of
the primaries, or of anything else pertain
ing to the election.
Their duty simply begins and ends with <
issuing the call. To the everyday citizen
the trick here accomplished may not be
apparent; but it is a trick, and one which j
should excite the sympathy of the party
for Mr. Spreckels.who so graciously yielded
up his personal interests under the fal.-<
--and lyinfc pretenses of his associates, from
whom he haa the right to expect and
ought to have received nothing but plain,
unvarnished truth.

Miss Currie Duke, the talented violinist of
Souaa's band, is the daughter of the famous ex-
Confederate general and fighter, Basil Duke of
Kentucky, who in addition to having been a
noted rebel leader, is a railroad president and
lawyer. It wus General Basil Duke who con
ducted Iluntiogton's recent light in the Blue
Grass State. The general's daughter is an
ambitious young woman and is proud to make
her own way in the world, though it is not
necewary that she should do so. She studied
music in Berlin and other foreign centers of
art. Sigmund Beel, the violin virtuoso of this
City, studied under the same instructor with
Miis Duke while abroad. lie was among those
who early called on her at the Palace, after the
arrival of the accomplished young Kentucky
iady.
Colonel Harrison Gray Otis of the Los An
geles Times is not only au up-to-date editor,
but an up-to-date politician, says the San Fran
cisco Bulletin. Recently a prominent Eastern
journal nominated Colonel Otis for the Vice-
Presidency on the Republican ticket. A man
with less capacity than Colonel Otis possesses
to look into the political grindstone would
have plumed himself on the nomination. But
our Los Angeles friend is not in the least
thrown off his balance. He says in an inter
view that a Vice-Presidential nomination
would do the Pacific Coast little good, but
would prevent the selection of a Cabinet oili
est from this coast. It is not often that a man
thinks of lib, State before he thinks of himself,
but in this case Colonel Otis teems to have
done so.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
One of the most popular pursers of the Pa
cific liners is Bernard B. Bendall of tha steam
ship Monowai, which leaves to-day for Hono
lulu and Sydney. Purser Bendall is a native
of New Zealand and is 27 years old. He has
been in the employ of the Union line, to which
the Monowai belongs, as clerk and purser for
11 years.
Mr. Bendall is known to all the newspaper
men of San Francisco as the prince of pursers
and the steamship officer who always has "a
story" for the reporter. It Is his custom when
his vessel is neariug port to prepare a copy for
each City paper of all the incidents of the
voyage, accountÂ»of notable passengers, descrip-
PURSER BENDEL OF THE STEAMSHIP MONOYYAI.
[Sketched by a "Catt" artist,]
tion of the cargo, etc., which he faithfully de
livers to the "boys" for publication.
Mr. Bendall likes San Francisco and enjoys
the society of the many friends he has made
here, but he is always glad when the Monowai's
bow is turned toward the far southwest. The
purser is a very bhy young man und will not
talk on tender topics, but the newspaper men
who have been welcomed to his stateroom have
seen the picture of an exceedingly pretty girl,
whose home is under the gleam of the Southern
Cross. Possibly this is why the purser is better
pleased when the good Monowai is following
her figurehead to New Zealand.
The Rev. C. Graham Gardner of London, who
has been for nine years laboring in Japan as a
missionary of tne English church, was one of
the passengers by the Australia, and is at the
Occidental. He is accompanied by his family.
"During the considerable time 1 have been
in Japan," said tho reverend gentleman yes-
C Graham Gardner.
terday, "I have labored in both city and
country, and been pretty much over the em
pire.
"Missionaries in Japan are being steadily
treated better. Christianity is also advancing.
This was shown in the recent war, when na
tive chaplains were permitted to accompany
the troops, and, as laymen, preach to them.
"As an instance of the better way in which
Christianity is being received, I may tell a
story that has lately been in all the papers of
the Mikado's land, but which has not yet be
come known here:
"Recently,.when the Crown Prince Kotaishi
became ill, several nurses were sent to attend
him. Among them was one who was very
thoughtful and careful. She was always at
tentive to any wants of the ailing Prince, and
he appreciated it so greatly that he asked her
why it was that she was so self-sacrificing. She
told him that she was a Christian, and that
she believed it to be her duty to do all she
could for whoever she might be called on to
attend.
" 'Then,' said the Crown Prince, 'I will call
you O Sen San, or missionary, since you are so
kind and are devoting your life to beneficent
work.'
"This is a little thing, a mere drop of water,
but it shows in a slight way something of what
is being done In Japan.
"I do not think there ever ought to be a State
religion there or anywhere. We have gotjpast
tnat, but the work that the various mission
aries are doing cannot fail of being helpful to
Japan.
"Physically, there are plenty of comforts in
Japan for everybody. It is about the cheapest
and be&t place to live that I know of. But, in
a way, a man tends to mental starvation."
Rev. Graham Gardner will go to Stockton for
a day or two and then go to Boston, where he
will stay three months, afterward crossing to
London.
THE YURUAN INCIDENT.
On Wednesday, the 26th of February, the
time limit of the ultimatum presented by
Great Britain to Venezuela expired. By or
before that day, as we understand the matter,
Venezuela was, according to England's terms!
to make those pecuniary and other amends,
which the latter had fixed, for the alleged
ill treatment of Inspector Barnes or to run the
risk of huvinjr force employed against her.
Venezuela had before her the fate of Nicar
agua, which, declining to have England act as
judge and jury in settling the damages
claimed in the liluenelda affair, aud allowing
the day fixed in the British ultimatum to pass,
was punished by having a British fleet take
possession of Corinto. B.ut a good many
things have happened since that former affair,
and since Venezuela received her ultimatum
froni Lord Salisbury. The lime for the en
forcement of the ultimatum against her has
expired without any movement, so far as is
known, either of the flying squadron or of
other British naval forces toward her coast.
Exactly what arrangement, if any, has been
made with Venezuela in this matter does rot
appear. Whether she has been willing to con
sider the personal grievances alleged to have
been suffered by Barnes anart from her
boundary dispute, iv view of the fact that the
high commission is now considering the lat
ter, or whether she holds to her original
ground that the Yuruan incident is too closely
involved with the boundary question to be
settled apart from It, is not yet announced.
But the one fact about which there scemg to
be no doubt is that the day fixed by Kngland's
arrogant ultimatum has passed without her
receiving the indemnity siie demanded, and
that she has not yet attempted to repeat her
Corinto game.â Now York Sun.
GOD'S HOURS.

J-or know thou art no child of chance, or fate,
"God's hours are never late."
Still must thou weave life's fabric to the end,

And weary bands fan scarce the shuttle send
He who hath set thy pattern counts the years.
.Before the loom with steadfast courage wait,

Wear, then, this flower of patience on thy breast.
When sorrow knocks and stays to sup with thee,
She leaves a blessing where she bides a guest,
Of higher hope mid wider sympathy.
Look upâ this message from the sky awaits

The seasons of the soul. Toil on and trust.

A REMARKABLE DOG.
John Hyslop, the watchman at the Mer
chants' Exchange station at Point Lobos, is
the owner of a bulldog who certainly seems to
possess the reasoning faculty. The animal's
name is "Jorry, ' and he is a fine specimen of
his breed. He is a little over two years old
and has already gained a, name for himself by
the exhibition of his remarkable faculties.
If Jerry is told to do a thing he will do it the
first time as any dog would. But if he is asked
to repeat the performance he will tiiink of an
easier way of doing it. A few days ago one of
the men at the station dropped a piece of wood
into a barrel that stood beside a box of the
same height and toJd Jerry to get it out. Jerry
jumped onto the box and then headfirst into
the barrel. He got the wood, but did not rel
ish the work in the least. The wood was
dropped back, but Jerry had no intention of
making another dive into the barrel. He
jumped onto the box, smelled all around the
barrel, and then sat on the ground to think.
It took him quite a while, but he suddenly
jumped up and pushed the barrel over so that
he could walk into it and take the wood out
without any trouble. The barrel was stood
upright again and the piece of wood once
more dropped into it. Jerry did not have to
think this time, but instantly pushed the
barrel over and brought out the wood.
Jerry's sense of smell is most keen. Mr.
Hyslop once lost a valuable pocket-knife and
spent many hours in a fruitless search for it.
At last he remembered that he was accustomed
to carrying it in the came pocket with his
chewing tobacco. He allowed Jerry to smell
the tobacco and in less than twenty minutes
his knife was brought to him. On another oc-

[Sketched from life.]
casion Jerry found a silver spoon that had
been thrown out by accident. It had been last
used for eating an orange and by ahowine
Jerry to sraeil the fruit he was able to locate
the lost article.
Jerry has been known to place two articles
together in such a v.ay that he couM carry
them at once instead o| making two trips. To
enumerate all of the remarkable things that
ho has done wou d be a long task, but the ver
dict of all who know him Is that ha is the

HOW THE GALENA GOT AWAY
Marshal Collins of Petaluma and His
Runaway â A Steel Schooner
for This Coast.
One of the coast greyhounds, the bark
Rufus C. Wood, which arrived from
Nanaimo yesterday afternoon, won another
prize for her master, Captain McLeod. He

northern port in a little over twenty days,
and the premium of a $50 suit of clothes
is his. The last trip of the speedy bark
was made in less than twenty days and
the energetic skipper was presented with
the prize dry goods and an additional -$50.
Captain McLeod says that his vessel is a
record- beater in any kind of weather, and
as long as her owners give prizes for speed
she will gather them in. When the hark
gets old and he retires he will start a
second-hand clothing-store on the water
front.
Mr. Coulter, the marine artist, in the ac
companying picture has caught the Wood
just as she i 3 shortening sail outside the
heads in the stiff breeze for a towiine from
the tug Vigilant.
The bark Galena started to sealhurs
day, her captain intending to take advan
tage of the favorable wind and a strong
ebb tide and sail out. The treacherous
currents, however, threw the vessel over
near Angel Island, where she almost went
ashore. She drifted clear, and was draw
ing dangerously near the rocks off Lime
Point wnen the anchor was let go.
The bark lay in her perilous position all
night, with the breakers booming close
aboard. Yesterday the captain concluded
that the services of a tug would be the
safer investment, and the tug Sea King
dragged the Galena to sea without further
mishaps.
Yesterday Marshal Collins of Petaluma
had an interesting runaway at the Tibu
ron ferry. He was in charge of Del Kirby,
a 15-year-old boy, wanted in Petaluma for
robbery. Youiik Kirby, with a companion
known as the "Kid,'' stole a small sloop
two weeks ago and went piratinc amonv:
sloughs around Petaluma and Lakeville.
Like the freebooters of the Spanish Main
they levied upon everything they came
across.
Boats and hunting arks of sporting clubs
were pillaged, barnyards were invaded
and the throat of many a slaughtered
chicken bled. They were overtaken anu
arrested, however, and the Petaluma offi
cer yesterday started home with his pris
oner, whom ne compelled to carry a bundle
of oars stolen at Lakeville. That the boy
could carry his plunder the Marshal took
the handcuffs Irom his wrists, which was
a mistake. Suddenly young Kirby dropped
his oars and darted away. The pirate of
the sloughs clapped on all sail and sped
across East street with Collins and several
policemen in pursuit.
Kirby led them a merry chase through
water-front alleys until they captured him
in a barn, where he had stowed himself.
Maishal Collins took no more chances
with nis nimble prisoner and the hand
cuffs were in use the rest of the journey.
The barkentine W. H. Dimona and brie
W. (j. Irwin arrived yesterday, seventeen

Dispatches state that the steel schooner
Honolulu was launched at Glasgow, Scot
land, and will soon be on her way to this
coast. She is a four-master, 192 feet long,
42 feet in beam and 18 feet deep, and has a
register of 1700 tons. Captain A. P. Lorent

INDICTED FOR PERJURY.
Isaacs Swore Falsely When
He Told of a Mock
Marriage.
Inez Mercer Made a Straight
forward Confession to the
Grand Jury.
Inez Mercer's marriage "engaged the at
tention of the Grand Jury yesterday.
After the examination of seven witnesses
the jury reported to Judge Slack of the Su
perior Court and presented indictments
for perjury against William C. Isaacs.
It was disclosed in the testimony of Ig
natz Edlinger, Mrs. Aloise Edlinger of the
Belmont House, and the bedmaker of
ttat lodging establishment, that Isaacs
was in San* Francisco, stopping at the
Belmont, on July 20. 1895. In Judge
Slack's court, during the hearing of Inez
Mercer's application for the annulment of
her marriage with A. B. Westcott, Isaacs
testified that he was in Portland on that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 7, 1896.
day of July, 1895, and attended a mock
marriage ceremony wherein Inez Mercer
and Westcott were the principals.
JIJjFuII accounts of the proceedings in Judge
Slack's court have been published in The
Call. After the hearing of the applica
tion facts were adduced to prove that the
marriage was genuine and that Isaacs was
not present at the wedding. Detective
Edward Gibson handled the case find lined
up the witnesses to sustain his findings.
Mr. Gibson testified, and so did James R.
McElroy, clerk of Judge Slack's court.
The Grand Jury also heard the official
stenographer of the court, who had in his
possession ihe original notes and tran
scripts of the Isaacs testimony.
In addition to this overwhelming evi
dence, Inez Mercer herself, whose aspira
tion for fame in the world of the drama, is
justitied by her style and looks, went be
fore the Grand Jury and produced a good
impression. She made a clear straightfor
ward confession of the facts connected
with the hearing of the case in Judge
Slack's court, admitting that Isaacs vol
unteered to go on the witness-stand and
testify that the|marria<re ceremony|in Port
land was a farce and the rtsult of an inno
cent "lark."
She was not pressed by the District At
torney of the Grand Jury to commit her
self. Tue impression obtains that she was
offered immunity from punishment if she
made a full confession.
She is detained as a witness for the State
in the prosecution of Isaacs, but will prob
ably be released on bail to-day.
Before she went into the jury-room she
was affectionately kissed by a lady com
panion, who no doubt fancied that the
osculation would brace up the witness to
bear the ordeal of meeting such austere
citizens as District Attorney Barnes, Fore
man Frank Maskey, Secretary McLennan,
Theodore Payne and others ot the Grand
Jury. It did not take her long to tell her
story, for she emerged irom the room
within ten minutes after she entered. The
scene could not have been a very trying
one on her nerves, for she came out appar
ently placid and unruffled. A male escort
adjusted her wraps about her shoulders,
and then she retired with a deputy sheriff
as one of her companions.
The Grand Jury also found an indict
ment for embezzlement yesterday against
Henry L. Fox on the complaint of Bridget
Holland, who intrusted to Fox's care
twenty shares of Spring Valley stock. The
District Attorney did uot ask for the issue
of a bench warrant. He explained that
Fox was already in custody on the same
charg? in another form.
The Grand Jury is constantly besieged
by attorneys and others who desire that
cases dismissed in the Police Courts should
be taken up. Many witnesses were in
waiting yesterday to be called in such pro
ceedings. The present Grand Jury did re
solve in a sense to have nothing to do with
cases which properly belong in the Police
Courts, but the resolution has been broken,
and the result is that nearly all the time
of every session is given up to the hearing
of criminal cases.
RECEPTION TO SANKEY
Great Audience Charmed by
the Sweet Gospel
Singer.
Addresses by H. J. McCoy, Dr. M. M.
Gibson and Songs by the
Evangelists.
An immense audience assembled at the
Young Men's Christian Association last
evening to greet the sweet gospel singer,
Ira D. Sankey, and that other other sing
ing evangelist who is following so closely
in his footsteps, George Stebbins.
The auditorium was crowded to 'the
walls during the earlier part of the even
ing, when the formal programme was ren
dered.
After the audience sang "At the Cross"
Secretary H. J. McCoy introduced Mr.
Sankey. The famous singer proved his
right to the title of speaker as well by an
entertaining reminiscent talk about his
labors and travels.
He sang with pathos and force, though
with somewhat less sweetness than of
old, "Some Day We'll Understand," pre
facing it with the life story of the author.
Rev. Dr. Cornelius, the late pastor of
several churches on this coast and in Den
ver. He tola also of his finding the hymn,
"Ninety and Nine," in an old newspaper,
and of his improvising the air while sing
ing to an audience in Scotland. When he
sang the pathetic air many in his audience
last evening were moved to tears.
Key. Dr. W. W. Gibson made an address
full of humorous and pathetic allusions to
his lone frienship for Mr. Sankey.
Mr. and Mrs. Stebbins sang Fanny Cros
by's hymn, "Saved by Grace," and Mr.
Steobins sang "Homeland," both efforts
greatly pleasing their audience. Mr. Steb
bins' voice unites, in a rare degree, sweet
ness and strength.
At the close of the formal exercises the
visiting evangelists repaired to the parlors,
where, with. Mrs. Sankey and Mrs. Steb
bins, they received those â and there were
many â who desired to be presented.
Mr. Sankey and Mr. Steblnns will be
heard at the association at 3 p. m. to-mor
row, when they will address an audience
of young men. At 6 p. m. they will speak
to an audience of ladies and gentlemen at
the same place.

PARSON DAVIES ARRIVES

"Parson" Charles E. Davies arrived in

and old admirers of his interest in the
"manly art." His last visit to this City
was three years ago, when he took Peter
Jackson, the colored pugilist, round the
country in "Uncle Tom's Cabin."' This
time he is the manager of John L. Sulli

thrown off a train traveling forty miles
an hour. We picked him up and he was
senseless. His clothes were on fire, as
some matches he had in his pocket ignited
when he fell. He was cut and bruised
frightfully, so that there was not a bit of
his body the size of your hand that did
not have a scar or bruise. We sewed up a
long cut in his scalp on the train with
piano wire. We had to >vait until he re
covered. He doesn't speak any lines, but
just boxes at the end of the show with
Paddy Ryan.
"After the accident a week ago I no
ticed a swelling in his knee and asked him
about it, because I thought it was dropsy.
'Oh. that's nothing,' he replied, and now
he will be thoroughly examined by a
physician.
"John has settled down and is living
very quietly now. He looks upon this as
his last tour.''
"And what is he gome to do?"
"He has been offered a hotel in St. Louis
and another in Boston, and he likes the
idea of being a hotel manager and owner.
Ho has no money, for he spent it like a
prince, but now John is keeping sober.
In one or two night stands he stays in his
rooms with his wife and shuns the tempta
tion. Sankey and he met in the train
near Stockton.
" 'You're a good fellow, John, and the
people like you,' Sankey said. 'John,
leave the bottle alone.'
" 'I'm doing that,' John replied.
"I have Joe Choynski in Chicago with
his wife. If ail tile boxers were like Joe
they would be an honor to the profession.
I may make a match between him and
Maiier on my return. Choynski is anx
ious to meet Maker and we are building
him up, so his chances of victory are good."
''Will Corbettand Fiusimmona meet?"
"I have every reason to believe they
will, and am of the opinion that Corbett
can do Fitz. If he is in as good condition
as when he met Sullivan he should win,
being younger, heavier and quicker than
Fitzsimmons. *
"I think Congress went too far when it
suppressed prize-fighting. If it were only
as expeditious in passing other laws as it
was in prohibiting fighting the country
would be very much better off than it is
to-day." - â â
While Mr. Davies is known as "Parson
all over the world there are not many peo
ple who can tell how he received the
appellation. Davis was directing an ath
letic and boxing tournament in Madison
square Gardens, New York, when William
K. Vanderbilt asked : "Who is that digni
fied gentleman there among the sports?
He looks like a parson."
"Oh, that is farson Davies," replied a
friend of the famous patron of sports.
And the littie crowd went down to the
ring and shook hands with the "parson."
A WAGNER CLUSTER.
Some Good Music Given at the Sym
phony Orchestra's Con
cert.
The sixth popular concert of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra was given
yesterday afternoon in Golden Gate Hall
to a thoroughly appreciative audience.
All through the performance the music
was good, but the Wagner cluster aroused
more interest and applause than any other
part of the programme. The overture to
"The Flying Dutchman" was played in a
dramatic and musicianly manner which
aroused a strong demand for its repetition.
The TOrspiel to "Lohengrin" was a little
more* rough, particularly as regards the
strings, but it was by no means an unsat
iM.utory performance. W. H. Colvard's
playing of the "Hong to the Evening Star"
a* a trombone solo fairly brought down
the house. The player was accompanied
tÂ»v the pianoforte and the strings. The
n ir. h from "Tarmhanser," which was ex
â¢â â iv played, finished the Wagner
â¢â¢T.
Tue rest of the programme consisted of
Met thuven's overture, "E<;mont," and the
x i old "Intermezzo" from the "Caval
kria." The latter has not. lost a whit of
n> popularity evidently, for the audience
insisted on its repetition.
Miss Caroline Shindler, the vocalist, was
accompanied by the orchestra in the
soprano recitation and romance from
"William Tell," and the musicians did
pood work in not overpowering the young
lady's pretty, childish voice. In the songs
by Godard and Chad wick, which Miss
Shindler sang with piano accompaniment,
her upper notes, the best in her voice,
were heard to good effect, but she in
dulged in the tremolo more than a vocalist
is justified in doing if she wants to keep a
freehold to her voice.
On the 13tb inst. the programme of the
symphony orchestra will include Beetho
ven's First Symphony. J. Hamilton
Howe will, as usual, conduct.
END OF AN OLD SUIT.
Michael Conniff Secures a S6OO Judg
ment Against tlie City.
Michael Conniff has secured a judgment
for $600 against the City for damages done
by street work.
The suit dates back from 1879, when
Conniff owned property on the corner of
Francisco and Jones street. The City was
then cutting Montgomery avenue through,
and in doing so they left Conniffs lot so
that, after the first rain, it rilled with
water. The water ran into his house eight
feet deep, and he sued for $5000 for the
damage it did. The verdict announced
yesterday gives him $<XX).

FREE KICKS AND KISSES
Dr. Jordan Addresses the Psychi
cal Society on Mental
Evolution.
A Free Will in the Same Category as
Free Osculations and Recal
citrations.
Dr. David Starr Jordan addressed the
California Psychical Society on "The Evo
lution of Mind" at Golden Gate Hall last
evening. Dr. Jordan said:
The old psychology was based upon hypoth
eses. It is not received with very much favor
by the scholars of the day. The psychology oi
the present is in a sense an exact science, that
is as exact as a science can be.
The freedom of the will comesnnderthe same
category as the free kick and free kiss. If you
are permitted to kiss the osculatar y act is free,
otherwise not.
The mind I would define as the sum total of
mental activities. Psychic I would define as
pertaining to the nerve forces. These defini
tions will suit our purpose this evening.
You will find that the function exists, al
though in a clumsy form perhaps, before tho
organ which discharges it. In other words
there is thinking of some sort done before there
is a mind.
The consciousness bears about the same re
lation to mental effort that the flame does to
fire. Of course thtre may be lire without
flame, but when the fire is active there is sure
to be flame.
Science knows nothing of immortality. The
whole matter is outside the realm of psy
chology, or if not outside psychology it is with
out the science with which 1 am acquainted.
You remember Tennyson's words to the
flower he plucked from a cranny in the wall.
We are in the same state of mind as he. Could
we tell what that little flower is we could tell
whatman is.
The tip of a plant is the sensitive part. It
is the motive part. The brains and muscles
of the plant are not segregated, therefore they
may hardly be called brains and muscles.
Dr. Jordan explained the structure and
system of sensory nerves. ''There is a
necessity on the part of the lower animals
of aatomatic obedience, ana reflex action
is a form such obedience takes in higher
animals," he said. "Responses to the
warnings of sensation become stereotyped
and we call them instinct." He contin
ued:
The next step in animal rank is shown in
the power, not of obedience to instinct, but to
rise above such instinct and exercise choice.
Intellect, I take it, is the ability to make a
choice.
That action is good which tends to the de
velopment of the person who performs it or to
the development of others. Sometimes that
which is good for one person may be bad for
another.
Reconciliation of such divergent interests is
one of the chief responsibilities of this life.
Your ancestors have been good people, else
you would not be here.
All nerve action is the result of information
gained from the outside. The essential char
acter of nervous action is: First, the recep
tion of the information; second, its convey
ance to the brain; third, tne result as shown
in the influence upon the muscular portions.
Impulses to action are the results of mem
ories either of the individual or of the race.
STUFFED WITH OPIUM.
A Pair of Overalls Found in the Bunk
of a City Prison
Trusty.
Captain Robinson, in charge at the new
City Hall prison, has caused the removal
of Leroy Mason, a trusty, to the County
Jail. Mason is one of the prisoners who
recently became intoxicated from the
liquor brought to him by V. Viso, a res
taurateur on Larkin street.
Viso was found guilty yesterday before
Judge Conlan of smuggling liquor into
the City Prison.
When Mason's bunk was searched yes
terday prior to his removal to the County
Jail an old pair ot overalls was found lit
erally stuffed with opium. The drug was
made up into solutions, pills and cigar
ettes.

PASTOR BROWN
AGAIN A WITNESS
He Makes an Earnest Ap
peal to the Church
Council.
EMOTIONAL AT TIMES.
The Doctor Make a General and
Sweeping Denial of Mrs.
Davidson's Charges.
WILLIAMS MOTION WITHDRAWN
John Bickfoid and Mrs. Barton Make
Startling Statementsâ Miss Over
man Files an Affidavit.
It required nearly as hour and half of
the ecclesiastical council's time yesterday
morning to unravel five minutes' hasty
action of the night before.
. The burning question with the associated
judges of Dr. Brown, was to determine
exactly what they meant in the resolution
passed declaring that the pastor was not
in the habit of walking or making clan
destine appointments either with the sis
ters of the church or others outside the
pale of the consecrated edifice.
The main objection to the peculiar in
dorsement cf Pastor Brown was found in
the fact tbat it anticipated a probable or
possible part of the final verdict. To abide
by such an expression now precluded even
3 discussion of Mrs. Stockton's testimony
at any time in the future.
Mr. Scudder raised the first objection to
the resolution, his remarks being strongly
seconded by Dr. Tenney. In fact every
member of the council appeared anxious
to expunge the more than committing
words from the records, but they did not
seem to know just how to ge; a; the matter.
Finally, from the parliamentary quick
sands in which the council fonnd itself
almost hopelessly foundering, somebody
found a way or.: by making a motion to
return to the original motion. Then came
a motion to lay on the table the original,
en the question of Dr. Brown's clandestine
meetings with women. This was lost. A
motion to adopt the original motion met
with the same fate. Then a motion to
have it expunged from the records was
carried, and the council was enabled to j
set down to dM business which had called I
it together. *
Drying th . long discussion Dr. Frown
gave no outward evidence that the repeal
of the resolution would be objectionable to
him. Once he remarked that he had no
objection to the motion being wiped out,
but would reserve the right to bring all
the witnesses he might desire to prove
tha: he was no* a clandestine man.
Th; accused paster then took the wit
riess-jtacd. At first his voice was so
husky as to be heard scarcely five feet
away, but as he warmed up to the subject
his utterances twesme more distinct, until
at the end of haii an hour his every word
could be heard throughout the Jecture
room. Dr. Brown showed himself to be a
man o! many moods. Firs; he was gentle,
then baa, at another time flushed with
anget and in the next breath choked with
tears. He was facetious if the moment
seemed propitious, or impressively sad if
the occasion seemed to call for it.
Dr. Brown began by saying tea: he had
in his possession certain letters written to
Msttie Overman during -.-.â¢? period c: that
young lady's visit to Tacorna. The wit
ness said, they ha'i been written at the
very tiM Mrs. Davidson alleged tha: he
Has pouring into her willing ear a tale of
illicit love for Martha Overman. There
were three letters placed in evidence, bear
ing the dates December SI, 1531, February
Id, and Aucust 2. 1585. They were a.. of a
purely platocic character, and the doctor
.- .__: to impress this upon the council
and audience by softly murmuring,
-iweet love letters, these!** '
; Without giving the council time to ask
any questions. Dr. Brown remarked some
what hs!?tily that he had now reached that
point when Mrs. Davidson Beans promi
nently in the case. The witness recieated
in substance the story told by Mrs. David
son as to the latter's visits to the church
study and of free cent calls a; the alleged
blackmailer's home. He said, however,
tfca; during ail this time no suspicion en
tered his mind thst Mrs. Davidson was
other than a pure, cfcrisdaa woman.
Their conversation was chieily about Miss
Overman, and it was now clear to x:ira that
she had led n^> to this subject for the pur
pose of entrapping him.
The pastor acknowledged the visit to the
Y. M. C. A. rooms with Mrs. ltavidson.
but explained this by saying that he had
gone there for the* express purpose of
showing his aged friend jhe completeness
of that! institution. They hsd a talk in
one of the f9 late rooms. Miss Overman
being the theme of conversation. "I can
see now,' added the witness, "what I
could net then, tha; Mrs. Davidson was
extortine from me under the guise cf
friendship my opinion of Miss Overman,
to be csed against me later."
Dr. Brown" then made an earnest appeal
to the council to put themselves in his
place and see what they would - do. The
witness declared that be had never called
Mrs. Davidson his me; in Christ, saying
it was a sacrilege for her to put ssch
words in his raeatb.
The pest : related bom Mrs. Davidson
came to him and borrowed various sums
of money, until the amount reached $91
It was nc; oSered in evidence whether
this money was ever repaid. It might have
gone to pay Mis.i Overman's tuition, so far
a* he - rew.
- Dr. Brown than told in a grapnic man
ner the event* leidinr cp to and following
the payment of fo-v^hush-money to Mrs.
Davidson. The story, as related by tie
pastor Â«i- scbstanuallr the same as that
already published, though he gaTe ii in
altogether new coloring. He aaranced.'as
a reason for treating ""Mrs. Davidson so
kindly after â  becoming convinced that she
had extorted r iaocey~frora him. that he
thought a woman's curiosity would prompt
Mrs.~Baddin to coma and see the man sac
had TictinMcd and that Mrs. Davidson
would pive some sign of her presence. He
watched closely, but it never came, and he
was convinced j thereby that bis exstwhiie
ared friend bad wronged him.
"Then it was ; that he determined to see
Miss Overman. He wen* to Ayers School,
bet, seeing w-ii : bis Toung'triend was
engaeed,- made' a pastoral visit, returning
about 4:30. He saw f Miss Overman in
company with three young f ladies and so
walked hastily to : the - corner of Pine and
Kearay streets, intending to intercept her
there. * Half a minute later his young
friend came along, and, without â¢ mincing
matters,- he asked her if she knew thai
Mrs. Davidson bad secured JSOO from him
for her. , : Miss Overman 1 almost shrieked.
the pastor said, and : he was erei'.iy afraid
then would be a scene en Kearay street.
The pastor and Miss Overman went im
z.~. :â¢;...- w e ciiurcli i;-:j, vlicu^h
the manner of reaching that point as re
lated by the former did' not tally with
that told by his then companion when
giving her testimony. The doctor ex
plained this by saying his young friend
was mistaken. Once in the study all the
horrible details of Mrs. Davidson's scheme
were laid bare. Miss Overman was indig
nant, excited and determined by turns.
She would have nothing more to do
with her old friend unless she would re
pent and turn over to the rightful owner
the sum of $500. As is well known, this
was never done, Mrs. Davidson and Miss
Overman parting company then and there.
Five days later the last-named lady tooK
up her* residence at the home of Dr.
Brown, and two days after this her former
roommate became an inmate of the City
Prison.
When Dr. Brown had finished his state
ment the council adjourned until Tuesday
at 10:30 o'clock, when the pastor will be
recalled for cros^examination.
in the afternoon a committee, consisting
of Rev. Dr. Hoyt. Rev. Mr. Sink and Mr.
Curtis, visited Miss Overman for the par*
pose of securing a deposition concerning
her physical condition before leaving for
Tacoma and during her stay there. . It is
understood that Mrs. Brown and Mrs.
Aben also made depositions covering this
same point.
The committee on charges has in its
possession a statement Eton August de
Gay, now an inmate of the Veterans'
Home at Yountville, which may cut quite
a eon in the case. Mr. de Gay states
positively that there is not only a Mrs.
Baddin, but that he knows her well.
Last October De Gay says he was work
ing in section D of the" Pleasanton hop
neids. Next to him was a woman who
cave her name as Mrs. Baddia. She had
two children, one of them being probably
twelve years old. At the end of a few
weeks Mr*. Baddin left the hop fields with
the avowed intention of coming to San
Francisco. Since that time De Gay says
he has not seen or heard of her, except in
connection with the Brown scandal. Mr.
de Gay maces oath that this mysterious
person exists not in the mind, bat in the
flesh, or at least she did less than six
months ago.
This story is practically the same as
that published in The Call January S. A.
Mrs. Batidia was traced to the Pleasanton
hop fields, but there all trace of ncr was
lost.
Mrs. Hild3 Barton ha? to.i the com
aiittoa oa chames ail she knows of the
Brown-Overman scanda.. Her tes:

of ihe alleged illicit relations between Dr.
Brown aad M ss Ovanaaau Mrs. Tunneli.
si i ays wt : : laeoa i to nurse Miss
Overman throuch a critical illness, the
I of an indiscretion. Mrs. Barton
.r says tbe missing witness told her
ail this and much more immediate. y after
her return from Tscoma.
The prosecution, in the unaccounted ab
sence of Mrs. Tunnel!, rely upon Mrs. Bar
ton to clinch the case ajrainst the pastor.
The excil | events of the week have
proven too much for Miss Overman, and
â¢he is confined to her bed, though she will
probably be able to attend the next session
cf the council.
The principal of the stenographic school
where *Miss Mattie Overman sr-ent a few
weeks of her leisure time tells a little
different story from that related by the
young woman and Dr. Brown. He" says
that on the afternoon of the las: ..ay Miss
Overman attended the school a eentleman
whom he now recognizes as Dr. Brown
called. He asked to see Miss Overman,
whereupon that young lady asked to be
excused for the "day. She" never came
back. The pr::. pa said Miss Overman
had paid her own tuition.
The council will probably conclude its
labors next week. Dr. Brown will be
cro?s-examirted Tuesday, following which
will come a lengthy statement from Mrs.
Brown. Then "the" evidence in rebuttal
will be introduced, after which the council
will retire to make up its verdict.
According to the programme as it stands
now John Bickford will go on the witness
stand next Tuesday. He is the "dark
horse," so to speak â the witness in whose
courage and firmness Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper
has the greatest faith. He is a man, she
believes, who canno: be intimidated by
Brown. He is supposed to know all about
the Overman letters, where and how they
were found and the process by which they
were given out for publication.
Mr. I -.-â¢-". was seen at his residence
last evening by a reporter from The Call.
He said in reply to questions concerning
the Overman letters: "I do not desire to
ssy anything now about these letters. On
the witness-star. l I will tell all that I
know. In this case I have no more in
terest on one side than en the other and
am not in the pay of any one."
"Is it fair to ask where you got the
letters?"
"That Is aleadine question," said Mr.
Bickford. 'I will tell the council where
they were obtained."
â¢â¢D-d yon get them in this City?'*
"They were found in this City in a rub
blih heap. They were not stolen or pro
cured in any mysterious way. So house 3
were raided DC trunks broken to get
them.
"Dld you Berts sell th era to Brown?"'
"I did not. Now let me direct your at
tention to something The Cjo.l published
Tuesday. Here it is:

"Why didn't Dr. Brown produce the
man last Tuesday as be promised?" said
Mr. Bickford. "I shall demand that the
man be produced."
"Are the Overman letters genuine? "
Mr. Bickford replied : "I am sure they
are. Forged letters do no: bear the
Government "postmark on the envelopes.
I know thai other Overman letters are in
existence."
"Did any one offer the letters to. Brown
fora consideration ?**
"That I do no: know," said Mr. Bick
ford. "It is possible tha; some one know
ing of the letters may have made proposi
tions to seli them."
â¢'lt is fair to ask if your testimony will
implicate Brown?" 1
'No. I cannot say that Brown - will be
implicated by my testimony. 'What I
shall testify to may ' by corroboration
throw some light en the case."
'â¢Have the letters been purchased by*
any one i"
Mr. Bickf ord replied: "They hare not
been purchased.** ~ - *
â¢Was rneaey . paid fcr the . privilege of

"That cannot say," replied Mr. Bick
foni.
Mr. Bictford was formerly . connected
with ThieJ's Detective Agency of Portland.
He impresses one as an alert, resolute man
who understands himself. He denies the
statement that he Introduced Mr*. Tunaell
and Mrs. Buckley, and . seems ; to Ibe ex
tremely anxious that " as little should be
said as possible concerning his forthcoming
testimony. He avers distinctly that he

the published letters with the originals. 4
YESTERDAY'S PROCEEDINGS
Dr. Brown at Last Explained Why
Ho Paid SSOO to Mrs.
_ Davidson.
. The - council opened, the session yester
day at 9:30 a. at. j and 'spent half an hour
in getting itself disentangled * from a par-;
liament ry snarl, created by a - motion to
rescind the â¢ fallowing resolution adopted
on the evening before, on motion of Mr.
Williams: - -- ââ-.,.--_ v.ii;L- ;1 _;.^-i- -- r .
fCNtrai, ThÂ»: the oovaeU is ccaviseed ti*:
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 7, 1896.
! Dr. Brown has not been in the habit of making
! clandestine -appointments with any woman,
: either in the church or in tee streets of this
City, or *oingr to or from the church with any
I woman other than his wife.
. Some members thought that the resolu
: tion; was premature, and jit i was r . accord
; ingly ordered expunged from \ the records.
- Dr. Brown resumed his testimony and 1
spoke of Mattie Overman having told him
that Mrs. Davidson had asked Miss Over
man whether she had any of the letters
written to her by the doctor. She replied
to Mrs. Davidson that the doctor's letters
were colorless, and would - not serve the
purposes of the plot. Miss Overman sent
toTacoma, to her family, to gather up all
the letters that Dr. Brown had written to
her, and she thus secured ail the letters,
save, the one which she destroyed in her
anger.
Dr. Brown, therefore, handed a bundle
of letters to the council with the request
thai the last page of one of them be with
held from publication because it referred
to a family matter whica had no bearing
on this case a; all. These letters, he ex- j
plained, were between the dates on which
Mrs. Davidson said that Dr. Brown had
been confessing his love for Mattie Over
man.
The letters had been shown by Miss
Overman on December 22 to Deacon Dex
ter and Mr. Morse. They were read be
fore the council by Judge Advocate Wood
hams, and were devoid of any expression
of -tenderness.
They were addressed "Dear friend" and
signed "Yours sincerely." They treated
of church matters and of the contents of
certain philosophical and religious books
; which Dr. Brown had sent Miss Overman
; to read.
The language which he used in the let
: ter rebuking Miss Overman for her tender
\ expressions was, as near as he could re
: mem ber, the following : - "if you enter
tain mci) sentiments it would be mani
| festiy improper that I should write to you
| again, and I desire this to be understood
to end the correspondence."
I The witness next told of Mrs. Davidson
; waiting for him one evening in th? meet
ing-room of the church in the absence of
Mr*. Brown." She took his arm' and
walked with him toward the cars, and on
the way she began to praise Miss Overman
very highly. The doctor continued:
â¢â¢You must greatly miss Miss Overman from
your home," suggested Mrs. Davidson. I
frankly stated that we did, and that she had
been very pleasant company in our home. I j
did not thins then that I was committing my
self to a designing woman. I never, said to
Mrs. Davidson that Miss Overman was the most
intelligent woman I ever met, or that her read
ing was the wide;: of that of anywoman I ever
met, or thst she was a completely educated
woman. I did say that for her opportunities
and her age she was the bast read woman that
I' knew, and I don't know another woman of
-7 years of age who can discuss so intelligently
Herbert Spencer, Darwin, Huxley, ilot'ev,
Brummona, Shakespeare and others. She
often tines pat me to shame by her superior
knowledge of some of those important writers.
t The next incident was a visit made by
the doctor to the Co-operative restaurant
on Mission stree; for the purpose of being
introduced to a young man named Meyer,
who, Mrs. Davids .-..: . needed spirit ....
advice. After his introduction to Meyer
they sat down to lunch at one of the pub
lic tables, and after that Mrs. Davidson
walxed up toward home with the doctor.
"When they.arrived in front of the Y. M.
C. A. Hail she expressed a desire to inspect
the interior of the building. Dr. Brown
volunteered to show her through the build
ing. They wen: up to the secretary's
office, and* Mrs. Davidson began talking
about Miss Overman, jAt every point she
made religious discussion and* the affairs
of the church a vehicle for a discussion of
Miss Overman, said the witness. "She
was extorting from me, under the guise of
friendship, everything that could be con
strued as an admission of friendship for
that youn? lacy." He added:
Having never in my Ufa me; a woman like
Mr?. Davidson, with her cairn, intelligent and
reSned demeanor covering deep and dark de
siÂ£n?. I had cot ... slightest suspicion i.: her
motives.
The witness next told of several inter
views he had with Mrs. Davidson at her
place of business. The visits were in con
nection with the snbjec: of the Bible class
and the welfare of the church. Bbc and
Mrs. Meyer, her partner, had only one
room: the liebes block and Mrs. David
son to.d him that she hoped that her busi- j
ness would enlarge so that she could
have an extra room for herself and Mrs.
Meyer. The doctor continued :
It was i rcanesf by me to have a room
for myself in the "Liebes block, or that the was
to have a key, si thai the room would be
kept for Miss Overman. Kb one is allowed to
occupy the Liebes block for rooming purposes.
; My next call on her was at 2"25 Geary street,
in July, shortly'aiier she had removed thither.
I called again in Au?cs!, after Miss Overman
returned from the north. Miss Overman has
correctly described in her testimony what I
\ know :ranspired that Sunday between herself
and me. I spoke to her a; that door, and I
noticed that there was a change in her -c
; meanor. she &t once went to the comer of the
room and sat down with Mrs. Davidson's class.
â  I did not dream that I had written anything' to
give-just cause oÂ£ offense to Miss Overman.
The next episode was a narration of the
I manner i". which Mrs, Davidson borrowed
| some money of him, with incidentally a
| littie speech on his benevolence.
Mrs. Davidson cane one day into my office
and asked me to lend her tone nosey. "There
are persons in this City to-day â whohave had
oj me from $15 to $-20 and $25, c: which I
have never yet been repaid a dollar, and I
wish some of them were here to-day. I want
| it to be remembered here new thai "l was told
that a certain deacon had said of me that Dr.
Brown was a very benevolent man and had
given away half of his salary as pastor of this
ehurca. It is literally true tfiat I have not
i laid up one dollar of my salary. In the relief
: of poor people and people relaied to cc by ties
of blood I asve given away nearly half jar
â¢i..?.:;. " * :
The doctor apologized ! for having ren
dered th tribate to his own generosity,
i and went on to say that he let Mrs. Da rid.
son have $20 at one time, $40 at another
and $oU at another. Mrs. Davidson? told
him that she expected tee early arrival of
certain dividends from the East, and that
she would repay him when they arriveo.
She told him also that- Miss Overman was
taking or was about to take a course in
| stenography, and the doctor expressed
pleasure on hearing this statement.
The witness emphatically denied that he
: had ever talked with Mrs, Davidson about
the Temple or that he had ever
knelt and prayed "with her in private. "-
I never called Mrs. Davidson my mother ia
Chris:. I", 1 cever occurred to me to cse that
sacred came except in relation to two womenâ
my own mother and that other mother, who is
almost as dear to me, who died is Oberiin.
Whatever opinion yon but â be ; inclined : to
hold with recard to wjt â  knavery I eertainlv
think that i; has been made eviaeat that I am
sot & fool to c: and say such things as that
.woman says I said and did in ny interTieTs
with -â ::.
The doctor then proceeded to relate what
took place when, in obedience to the re
quest of Mrs. Davidson, tie called upon her
to discuss I a matter connected with the
Bible class. Mrs. Meyer was -in the room
when he called, but she left immediately
afterward.
After Sin. Meyer Trent out Mrs. Davidson
arose and locked the door. I thought that was
very strange, bus I thought that perhaps it
was ca account of hat desire to : be very pri
-*â¢â¢-:-Â£â¢. sÂ£e - bad something of ere*: i~
portaace to say to me which she did do: wish
should be overheard. , Vhea I was seated a
chance came in her masner and she began:
"Dr. Brown. the Stsjry I . have to ; tell yoa is a
long cue.- When we were la the Lfebes block I
was talking with a lady who did sewing for
i me and the : subject was her soul. 'â : I asked
her: *Way are yon cot a Christian?' and she
replied: -Mrs. baridaon. If yoa only knew toe

to be not â¢ his wife, and that there ice very
talas tnaspired traieh &ac afterward alleged

â  Then . Jdrs. ; Davidson, -. mraiag ;to ; me, said:
**Hr. Brova, 1 that .Jtl^iÃg-house keeper iden
cnÂ«s you as tha: minister of the gospel, , and
she has !deatiÂ£ed Miss Mi::.r Â«.v :=:i- 4.5 .-
yocag woman r, who , was :in * your company.
Further, Miss Overman has coaiessed, ana has
caul that she will iwear to what that iedging
house keeper and her lodger saw. take place in
that room."
During this recital every eye was turned
upon Dr. Brown, and the silence '< was
almost oppressive.
I looked upon her with utmost astonishment,
and I do not deny, with a great deal of terror.
I want yon to remember that at that time we
â¢ were in â  the midst of the revelations of the
>orth Beach crimes.- This City was wild with
excitement about the things that had taken
place at North Beach. Meetings were being
[ held at that time all over the City and in , this
church â ' to protest against the state of im
morality, revealed. by r those disclosures, â â  and
public feeling was very high.^ : '-= >â --â â  - M .-'â¢â¢ ...
1 said to Mrs. Davidson : "Where is the
woman that alleges such a thing with regard
tome? IJwan* youato take me to her that I ;
may say to her face that it is an infamous lie." \
She told ac to calm myself, and she said, "Dr.
Brown, you know what the state of feeling j
is with regard to those things. The public is i
in no mood to be trifled with in matters of the
violation of the seventh commandment. - The
public is willing just now to believe such
things." I realized then what I have experi
enced since, that if such an allegation should
be made in regard to me the first disposition of ;
the community at large l would be to believe
rather than to disbelieve it; that a quarter of a
| century of an honorable record would be noth
i ing as strains t the flood of scandal that would
be poured out against me. .
She then went on to say: â¢'You have made a
good many enemies. First of all you have an
tagonized the Church of Rome, and the Roman
Catholic church in this City would be only too
glad to see such a charge made against you.", Â»
This _ gave the doctor an opening for an
other little speech to the council and the
newspapers, and be made it.
I don't thins that Archbishop Riorian will
thank me for doing it, but I will say that from
my childhood up I have been taught to regard
the church of Rome as the antagonist, not only j
of Protestantism, but of many other things
that are good, until the present time. I have
been drawn in such a way that it would be al
most impossible for me to think that it would
be possible fora Catholic citizen to treat with i
fairness a Protestant whose interests would be
committed to his hands. The sentiments of a
lifetime have been revolutionized by my recent
experiences. Detective Seymour has been my ;
frier.d by night and by day. He is an ardent '
Catholic. He said to me, "Dr. Brown, I am
convinced that yon are an innocent man, and
from first to finish I an your friend in this
matter."
Dr. Brown exhibited considerable emo
tion while speaking of his Catholic friend
the detective, and he went on to say :
I want to say that certain names which never j
had any music to me before have become very
musical to mv ears, such as Mahone? and Mul
ligan and Haliigan, and so forth.
The witness spoke of a man named Ma
honey, a lodging-house keeper on Sixth
street, who said that he never saw Dr.
Brown in his house, and who sympathized
with him. Mr. Mahoney had never heard j
of a woman named Mrs. Baddin. Mrs.
Mulligan, who keens furnished rooms at
the corner of '-, Bryam and Sixth streets,
told Detective : Seymour that Dr. Brown
had never been in her house. She also
sympathized with the doctor. Here arose
another opportunity for a whack at the
newspapers and the doctor took advantage
of it as follows:
I was told by a friend that one of the leading
morning papers of this City had scoured San j
Francisco, its employes going to every restau
rant where such a thing could be possible, and
every hotel and boarding-house where such a
thing could be probable, and making inquiry
for the purpose of finding anywhere a shadow
or a footprint of C. 0. Brown, and they were
unable to find it.
I want to ask again here to-day in the light
of the suSering that you and ethers of the
newspapers have compelled me to undergo by
fai>e accusations, why. when you reached that
result you didn't publish it in the newspapers?
When you had dragne:ted this City way didn't
you publish i: and let the world know that
wi:h all your rsportorial ability and your de
tective instinct you had been unable to find
the slightest shadow of evil against me? I
thank yon lor the investigation, but I would
have thanked you more if you had Â» published
its results.
After glaring savaeely for a moment at
the reporters, including the good-looking i
young woman reporting the trial for a |
morning paper, Dr. Brown took a sip of j
water and a fresh treat of air, and went i
back to the Davidson episode.
Mrs. Davidson said: "'Dr.'Browu, that lodg
ing-house keeper is going to make you some
trouble," that the woman would surely pub
lish me. and I at] â¢- Overman and the lodger
would stand with her in the publication. Then
she said, "Now, the thing can be remedied,
buti: will take a very large sum of money."
Then she went on to unfold how much money
it would take. She demanded that I should
produce on or about noon the next day $2000,
and that I should pay for ten successive years
fIOO per moath. I said to her, "that is as im-
I possible for me to do as to take wings asi fiy.
I could no: think ol it.*
I had not made up my mind that Mrs. David
son was altogether a wicked woman.' She once
said of me mat I was sometimes â  crazy and I
must have been crary at that hour, for had I
been in possession of mv right mind at that
tine I should have called in advice and lo
cated -spies and trapped her.
The awfulness oi the situation in which I
was seemed to have dumionnded me. The
certainty that if the three women swore to a
story that I was a guilty pan they would be
believed in this community and the absolute
impossibility of fulfilling the payment of the
ran which she cad imposed upon, me almost
drove me mad.
â â â  "â  Sr.e said: "Dr. Brown, yon know you have
enemies inside the church." I thank God
that they have not been enemies during this
terrible experience that I have been passing
through, She put all that talK about the pres
sure ot the power of the Roman ' Catholic
church, my trouble with the socialists and
with Herron, and the skillfully intimated that
tho*e men would gladly pay any sum of money
rather than submit to a renewal of such expe
riences in the church.
I told Mrs. Davidson, "If those are the only
condition* that your lodging-house keeper
makes, you can go to your lodging-house
keeper." Tsea she took another tack. She '
said: "Dr. Brown, I think the case i* not so j
desperate: I will undertake to see her again." )
And. seizing . anything as an ; opportunity to
escape from that : conversation, 1 told her I i
would meet her that evening it 8 o'clock in j
the office of tbis church, and she. meanwjile,
would see if there â¢sold be more favorable
terms.
At 7or 5 o'clock in the eveningâ l don't re
member whichâ she came in and wen: over
tie. same grounds of the danger to be encoun
tered from public sentiment in the then ex
cited state of public ciscussion. Then she j
prodcced;& little roll of paper and said :
"This ii the ultimatum : she will take ?1000
down, at noon : to-morrow, $73 the Ist of the
next month, $45 the Ist o: the next month, â¢
and so alternately $75 and' s4s per month
for the period of ten years" (I â either
ten or five years). ,;
: I represented to her that such conditions
were utterly beyond me and I begged her to
tell me the name of the woman. I said, "Take
me to thai woman and let me aÂ£rm to her that
it is absolutely false." Mrs. Davidson said.
"It would do yoa no good. She has committed
this matter absolutely to me; I am her agent."
She said, "I hold . the secret of that woman's
".<r. end lean give you the absolute assurance
tha: I can keep her still." I cannot deny that
I â '.-_-.: to silence a wenan who cocid talk
about em in thai way. â  I said to Mrs. Davidson,
â¢â lt is utterly useless, I nerer shall attempt to
nee: those conditions." v
She named three of the most prominent trus
tees of the church and asked that I should go
and see them. ""They helped yon la the Herroc
matter," she said,- "and they will helj>.ytm
again. ** i said *-Xo ; I will lay no such, bordeo
â¢-:â¢-: then." Thea she said, â >':Â». Dr. Brown,
be patient end I will go egaic and tee this i
wessaa, and I will meet you at 10 o'clock, at !

Baddin lived two or three blocks from there.

ii Mrs. Davidson demurred i. at first, .bet
after some reasoning lon Dr. Brawn's part
she 'wrote : a receipt at ; his dictation, and \
thea it or, the' first tune, as he Winded tier
the money, she r*ve him the name of the !
iciKiag-libuse keeper. She inteduied the ]
I words "Agent for Jane Elizabeth Baddin."
j Dr. Brown continued: : .
: As soon as I got that name I handed her the
i money, pat the i receipt ,in an envelope and
placed it in my pocket. While she was leis
urely and with a business-like air placing the
money in her shop-bag I opened a directory,
and she grew ashen about the lips. She said to
me: -You needn't look ! in ; the directory for
! that name, for the lady has recently been mar
i ried.'! I said: 'That would not prevent her
husband from having his name in the direc
tory.,; He hasn't changed bis name; her pres
ent* name 'is Baddin, and . that must â¢ be : his
name." I looked back in the directories for
j two or three years but found no Baddin.
For twenty-four hours after that I scarcely
I knew what I did. . I tried to believe that I
i could not have been so â ; entirely deceived in
i Mrs. Davidson. She came to the church next
j Sunday with her Bible in her hand, her face in
i a glow and almost a 7 nimbus about her fore
! head. She had so - completely, resumed her
! Dious demeanor that I said to myseli, Can it
be possible that this woman jis the only Mrs.
Baddin?" After a time I came to ; think that ;
it wit? certain that Mrs. Davidson had acted in
good faith and out of a friendly feeling for me.
I I said if there is any Mrs. Baddin her womanly
curiosity will bring her to some of the services
of this church to see the man whom she has ;
victimized, and Mrs. * Davidson cannot keep
from turning her head around to look at her.
: Dr. Brown next narrated how he had
watched Mrs. Davidson in church to see if
she would look around for Mrs. Baddin.
I He often went in the vicinity of Mr.
Davidson's house to see whether she had
any callers," and he called there once at an
hour when a woman visitor would De likely
to be there, but these efforts in the de
tective line were fruitless. The doctor
proceeded:
After three or four weeks I came to the con- j
j elusion that no Mr 3. Baddin existed. Then I !
j said to myself: "The whole responsibility for j
this awful lie rests upon Miss Overman. If
Mrs. Davidson has no ground for approaching ;
me through other than her own person, that :
responsibility is with Miss Overman." and I
said, "I don't believe that could be possible."
Prior to this time, feeling that if what Mrs.
Davidson had said was true of Miss Overman ]
being in the plot, I didn't approach her for
j fear of raising a scene.
The witness went abruptly, from this
subject to the following declaration:
We know the names of three Mrs. Baddins
that have been approached with distinct temp
tations to buy their souls to ~ perjury against i
me.
Then the witness went on to say that on â 
j December 19, he made up his mind to see
I Miss Overman, whom Mrs. Davidson had
skillfully kept apart from himself and his
wife by falsehoods. He went to the steno
graphic school and caught a glimpse of
Miss Overman through the glass doors. Not
desiring to wait there an hour, for school
to close; he went on a car ana made a call
j on a parisihoner, returning at about 4:10 j
o'clock, when he saw Miss Overman coming !
down from the elevator on Sumner. street
with several other ; young women. : When
she left them, and he met her on Seamy
street, the following occurred:
I said to her, "Miss Overman, I |want to see
you on a matter of interest." She resented me
when I approached her. She was indignant,
aud wanted to know why I had approached
her on the street. I said, "I hope you will be
patient and listen to me, for I nave a matter
i of great interest." While we were crossing
Kearny street I said. "Do you know a Mrs. j
Baddin?" She said, "I never heard of such a
woman until now." I said, "Is it possible that
you are unaware that I have paid Mrs. David
son $500, in your name partly and partly in
the name of a woman named Mrs. Baddiaf"
9 She literally screamed, and I was fearful that
she would attract attention. It was sprinkling
at the time, and I put up my umbrella to bide
our faces. She protested her utter ignorance
of what had transpired. She said : "I must talk
with yon a minute more. ; Perhaps it will be
best to step into the study." I unlocked the
door, and we were there possibly five minutes
and possibly longer. She said: â¢â¢You and I j
mustsee Mrs. Davidson to-nignt. Oh, bow I
have been deceived in that woman!"
, A: B o'clock in the evening they came, and
we went upstairs ana 1 locked the door on ac
count of tramps.
When by Miss Overman's request . Dr.
I Brown told Mrs. Davidson what he had
{ told her , about the $500, Miss Overman
I sprang to her feet and said to Mrs. David
son: "You are an. infamous woman- Did
you. ever say anything like that about
me? You have lied to this man. : "Where
is that Mrs. Baddin? I demand of you to
take us to that woman. You yourself
have robbed tnis man of this money, and
you have got it this minute sewed up in
your skirt." ; "\ 'â  - - . r^'-
Dr. Brown continued: ' ;. .
It was 10 o'clock or a little after when we
got through, and when we came downstairs
Miss Overman whispered to me, "I shall leave
her house to-night." I said, "I don't think it
I wise to remain wits her."
The next morning the doctor received a
telephone message from Mattie announc
ing that she had left Mrs. Davidson's
boasÃj He thereupon told Mrs. Browu of
what had taken place 'the ni^ht before,
and on the next morning he and Mrs.
Brown went to see Miss Overman. Mrs.
Brown on that occasion invited Miss Over
man to her House.
; We foresaw that if there should be an arrest
and the consequent exposure of the plot a^aiast
me Miss Overman would be besieged with vis
itors, and that in face of the publicity no
lodging-house keeper would want to have her
in his house.:": : 'â¢- : - ' ! ; ;â  .:. : '- . ,"0 , â â¢;
Tns doctor explained that he had not
stopped Mrs. Davidson from teacaing the
Bible class &eeause it would have precipi
tated matters too suddenly. He had de
termined to pu: the whole matter is the
hands of the police, and did so, by advice
of Deacon Dexnerand Mr. Morse.
Here an adjournment was had until
10:30 o'clock next Tuesday morning.
NOT THIS DR. BROWN.
The Inquiry of the Melbourne
(Canada) Postmaster Is
Answered.
FRESNO, Cat-. March 6. â Professor
George S. Ramsay, of the Fresno Business
College and Normal . School, explains to
The Call's correspondent here the reason
for the pointed letter "of inauiry from the
postmaster of Melbourne, Canada, in re
gard to Rev. Dr. Brown, in to-day's Call.
Professor Ramsay" was formerly a mem
ber of the First Congregational Church a;
1 Melbourne. In 18SS this church had for
: its paster one calling himself "Rev. Dr.
Brown," but whose real name, as after
ward disclosed, : was J. P. Waters.
Rev. Mr. 'Waters, alias Brown, went
to Melbourne from Belleville, One,
in company -with â  a supposed ."Mrs.
Brown, but. who in reality was not his
wife bat a servant ; in , whose company he
had deserted bio real^srife in >"ew York.
Near the close of this gentleman's pastor
ate of over two years . "Rev. Mr. Brown"
got. into scandal with the organist of his
church and skippedâ what place no one
there ever knew. After learing Melbourne
letters were ; received from the supposed
Brown's wife from New York State telling
of her husband's change of I name and do
plicity. These letters were signed "Mrs.
Dr.' Waters." for i: seems that the preach
er's real wife was a practicing physician.
S This "Rev. Mr. Brown" : was: a much
younger man than Rev. Charles O. Brown
cf . San Francisco. : Professor Ramsay iis
quite - certain that this . affair lis ;, what
prompted the Canadian postmaster's letter.

RAILWAY TO YOSEMITE.
A Standard Gauge Line to Run
From Merced to the
Valley.
ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION.
Capital Stock of $1,500,000â Direc
-*" tors Are Well-Known Capi
talists.
Articles of incorporation were filed yes
terday in the County Clerk's office by the
Yosemite Valley and Merced River Rail
way Company: â  :
The directors are James B. Stetson, John
D. Spreckels, Robert Oxnard; O. D. Bald
win, James Cross, Albert L. Stetson and
G. A. Wuikop. The capital stock is
$1,500,000, of which sum $90,500 has been
subscribed. '
The stock, however, has not yet been
offered for sale, and so far, although men
of millions are Dack of the enterprise,
Albert L. Stetson and G. A. Wnlkop are
the largest subscribers. â¢
It is stated by promoters of the railway
that a most picturesque and productive
part of California will be penetrated by the
new line, and consequently the enterprise
will have a dual significance. That is, it
will afford a delightful route to the Yo
semite Valley for passengers, to whom
will be presented the well-known beauties
of the Merced River Canyon at all season?
of the year.
The region about to be opened is also
rich in mineral and lumber products now
waiting for communication with the out
side world to develop them. .With both
features combined tne Merced River Rail
way will be a valuable feeder for the San
Francisco . and San Joaxuin Valley Rail
way and the Southern Pacific line, neither
of which, however, will *. have any prefer- :
ence with its owners and managers.
The new line ; is to have its principal
terminus in Merced. From there it will
be run practically northward to Snelling,
at which point it will turn . eastward to
Merced Falls and then follow .: the river
canyon nearly all the remainder of the
way to the Yosemite Valley. At Horse
shoe Bend it will almost .touch Coulter
ville, and a station will be established for
the. mines of that region and for the prom
ising town of Coukerville, situated in the
heart of the great mother lode. There
will be another station at Bent:."/? mill
for Bear Valley and Mariposa. The term
inus at the valley will be The Cascade*,
jus: outside the Yosemite reservation.
The road will be " standard gauge and
heavily constructed throughout.
"The Cascades," said Albert Stetson,
"where our depot will be, is one and a half
miles from the entrance to the valley and
six miles from the Stoneman House, the
acknowledged center of the Yosemite Val
ley. We have no idea of trying to get
into the valley, as we fully understand {
that a railroad would detract from the
natural scenery; and we also have other
good reasons for not going beyond the
point chosen as our mountain terminus.
"The project was started two years ago
by a man from Chicago, G. A. Wclkop,
who was interested in lands about Merced,
and he had a survey made for an electric
line. Afterward he found it was hardly
practicable, because power could no: be
transmitted economically over long dis
tances. Then the proposition of a steam
road wa3 started and I became interested
in it.

these show it to be feasible and financially
a warrantable proposition to build this
I line into the valley. The scenery along
' the wav is said to be equal in many places
â to that'of the valley itself. As a btuiness
proposition the r.es Yosemite \ aLey and
Merced Railway Company is a very at
tractive one. Tourists will be able to go
to the valiey at all seasons of the year, the
Merced Canyon being so low that the line
wili never be blockaded with snow. At
the present time toorista can omy go to
the valley daring three months of tie
year and that aurin: the hottest seasc:,.
Owin^ to this fact Eastern tourists w;.->
spendÂ° their winters on this coast have no
means of seeing the wonderful scenic gra:.
denr of the Yosemite Vailey.
"It takes three days to get into the ya -
ley now. You leave here at night, trav- .
all night and portion of next day and ge .
to Berenda. Then you have to stage onr
and a half days longer over a rough mount
ain road. Returning three days more are
consumed, or exactly s.x days in ail going
and coming. ... . * â¢-
"The cost of the round trip is about *oo
for transportation alone, to say nothing of
Pullman-car charges, hotel bills, etc. By
the new Yosemite Valley Railroad route a
passenger can go there from Ban Francisco
in from fifteen to seventeen hour 3, at an
expense of one-third or less of the above
charge. You can then leave here late in
the afternoon and be in the valley next
morning, and you can do this at ail sea
sons of the year overoar road. Just think
of the immense numbers of Eastern tour
ists who go to Southern California every
winter, hut are deprived of seeing the won
ders of Yosemite! And they wiii have au
opportunity of seeine tbe vailey in its
sublimity, mantled with snow, perhaps, or
wonderful in its wintery moods. These
tourists would make it a" point to see the
Yosemite.
'â¢From Merced to the valley over the line
is eighty miles. The last six miles have a
' grade of '2.^i to 3 per centum, curving
around the mountains as the road ciimbs
the Sierras. Those curves will be more
pronounced than on a transcontinental
road, for the reason that we are not in so
much of a hurry to get over distance, ana
this curving w'lil add to the novelty and
wi.-J excitement of traveling in the monn
tains. There will be only about 100 or 200
feet of tunneling, and that will be at the
Devil's Gate, a rugged and wild spot in the
canyon. The building will be canyon or
sidehiil work most of the distance.
"How soon do you propose to oegia act
ual construction ?''
â We expect to begin building as soon as
the rain stops, and we find the" way opta
for the work.
'â¢It is not to be a passenger road solely.
While ttere is no doubt that the Yosemite
travel alone would make this railroad a
good-paying proposition, there will be the
rreight and passenger traffic to Snelline,
Merced Fails. Hornitos, Bear Valley,
Mariposa and Couiterviile.
'â¢We will tap the mother lode. The
mining industry in Mariposa County has
taten a fresh start- Old mines are
reopened- >"ew methods of working ores
and mines by electrical power and new
process are being applied, which not only
makes it profitable to work these loa^:"
--abando'ned mines, but is helping those
already in operation and is eiiconraging
prospecting. One company alone has
-â -:.: $ â¢ 100 in developing a mine tl.~ r.
At present machinery and supplies have
to be carted forty miles to the mines at
great expense, so the raiiroaa will be a
wonderful factor in developing Htm
mines. Indeed, I would not be surprised
to find a second Cripple Creek up there.
Such has been the result of the ir.inir.g
boom in that vicinity that the pop_ a
of Couiterviile has increased from 500 to
thin one year.
â¢There are vast forests of sugar pine,
the most valuable wood in the market,
_â  :he line, and this railroad will get
mi - -s and " millions of feet of it to the
market. Besides, there are great quarries
of t-ze building stone, marcle, granite and
lime deposits on the route. One man
suaranteed us one trainload a day of

of freighting to the Yosemite fuliy 75 per

Dupont and Berry Streets Have
Been Ordered Closed by the
Police.
THE CHIEF IS IN EARNEST.
\Y men of the Half-World to Be Rele
gated to the Suburbs or the Pur
lieus of Chinatown.
The moral wave which floated over the
Police Department after the two horrible
murders and the suicide on Morton street
1 1 cently is roiling along toward the north
over Dupont and Berry streets. These
quarters have been given up for years to
the women of the town, but while they
ore more remote than Morton street, they
!i-e so much the more likely to be the
scenes of terrible ana mysterious crimes.
Chief Crowley has come to realize the
state of affairs as it exists, and he decided
yesterday to wipe out the hotbed of in
iquity and temptation, by driving the
women from their dens into quarters more
distant from the center of the City.
In consequence Captain Wittman ha 3,
according to instructions, followed out the
fame line of duty he pursued in the
Morton-street case. He has placed three
i lVicers at each end of Dupont and Berry
streets and every individual visiting these
-luarters is subjected to close scrutiny.
This patrolling system will be continued
fora few days, after which, if the women
do not leave their dens of their own
accord, they will be arrested as vagrants,
or on a charge of violating a city ordi
nance.
This method has proved so successful
en Morton street that Captain Wittman
riled his report yesterday with Chief
Crowley, stating that the street was
positively clear of women violators of the
law.
Chief Crowley declares that henceforth
the class of women he is making war upon
must seek quarters in Chinatown or in
some suburban locality. He will not have
them ply their trade under the eyes of the
women and children passing in the thor
oughfares of the City.
The Chief and his subordinate officers

form have been sued by a few of the
women who have been ousted from Morton
street. They claim damages each in the
sum of $1000.
COAST SEAMEN CELEBRATE
The Eleventh Anniversary of
the Union Fittingly
Observed.
\ Street Parade Followed by Speech-
Making and Exercises at
Union Hall.
The eleventh anniversary of the forma
tion of the Sailors' Union of the Pacific
was celebrated by a parade and exercises
at the union hall on East street last night.
There were 210 seamen in line, all in full
uniform, and, beaded by a band, they
marched up Market street to Montgomery,
a! .g the latter street to Bush and thence
to Kearny and back to Market and then
rth, returning to the water front by
Ilaward. All along the line of march
they were regarded with much interest.
The column was in command of E. Ander
son, with Captain Finerty, Captain Lin
wald and Sergeant St. Clare acting as aids.
The parade was followed by exercises at
X T nion Hall. \Valter Macarlhur presided.
He said the occasion was one of glorifica
tion for the Seaman's Union.
"We are here," he said, "to celebrate the
eleventh anniversary of our beloved organ
ization. This is a birthday anniversary.
We come together to look back over the
troubles we "have gone through and with
great hopes for the future. The sailors
have much to be joyful over. They have
of late years bÂ«en looked down upon by
the public at large. Conditions got so bad
that the sailors had almost lost hope.
Eleven years ago a few sturdy seamen met
on the Folsom-street wharf and founded
the union, and the courage and manhood
of the seamen asserted itself and success
has ensued.
"The seamen have fought a bitter tight
during the dull times of late years and
they have achieved triumph after triumph.
Times have changed. To-day we find the
seamen of the country respected among all
labor unions. Andrew Furuseth is now
at Washington as our representative up
holding the claims of all seamen, and as a
result we have the Maguire act, the first
statute instituted by the seamen them
selves. It provides for the freedom of the
seaman to dispose of his own body and his
own wages as he sees tit. The example of
the seamen of the Pacific ha 3 been fol
lowed by the seamen of the Atlantic. Our
representative is now trying to get other
measures affecting seamen passed by Con
gress.
"The seamen must stand together and
work for decent treatment on board ship,
to make their contract with the owner or
master of the ship, and keep the boarding
master in his place. We are not organised
to drive the Shipowners' Association out
of business and injure commerce, but we
are organized to fix the standard of wage 3
and protect our rights on land and sea. '
He spoke feelingly of the men who died
at their posts and also of the seamen now
confined in the Aiameda jail. .
H. W. Hutton spoke of the legal battles
which the union had fought and won.
"In days gone by," he said, "the union
had much to contend with. The people
ridicuied the idea of the seamen forming
an organization of this kind, but it tri
umphed from the start. It always had
nobie leadersâ men who sacrificed tbem
selrte for the union. Before the days of
the union the boarding-house keepers
were all getting rich and the sailors were
ail suffering. Now the boarding-house
roasters say they are all broke and the sea
men are free and prosperous. The sailor
was a slave in early days. He was owned
by the boarding-house master and the mas
ter of the vessel. Now his wages are paid
into bis own hands and he can pay his
board and other bills just the same as any
other man. But the laws of the United
States affecting sailors are inhuman and
a "They U sbould be reformed. It is wkhin
the power of this union to reform them.
With such laws in force it is not surprising
that the commerce of the United States is
going down. If a sailor lands at a foreign
port it was formerly held tuat tho Consul
could collect the wages due him, pay his
bills and send him back horac.^ But the
union had that law knocked out.
Alfred Fuhrman and M. McGJynn also
the seamen and praised the good
work they had done in tne past and pre
dicted even a better condition of aftairs lor
ttie future. ___

AN INDUSTRIAL PAVILION.
Manufacturers Getting Ready for
a Home Product Exposi
tion.
They Contemplate a Huge Structure
Suitable for Entertainments as
Well as Fairs.
Although the officials of the Manufac
turers and Producers' Association have
met with many obstacles in their pro
jected home industry exposition, still they
are confident there is success ahead, and
that the fair will yet be held this year. It
was the intention to open the exposition
in the spring, but if it is to be held it will
not open until about July 1. Several
weeks ago an offer was made to the asso
ciation of the large vacant lot on Twelfth
street, between Market and Mission, but
that offer held good for only six months.
To have created even a shed-like structure
on the premises would cost- $25,000 or $30,
--000. It was decided that this would be too
expensive for a six weeks' or two months'
exposition.
Ah effort was then made to secure a five

Association on Twelfth Street.

ing thereon a more pretentious appearing
building.
Joseph Brandenstein, who owns the
Eleventh-street side of the lot, said that
he was willing to give such a lease, and
the Van Bergen family of this City ex
pressed themselves as favorable to such a
transaction. However, the lease must be
given by John Van Bergen, who is now in
Europe, and it will be several weeks before
his answer can be received. If it be favor
able the association will at once find the
ways and means of ; going ahead with the
project and erecting a suitable building.
In anticipation of a favorable decision
on the part of the property-owners the
matter of the style of building most suita
ble for the purposes has been considered.
It is the intention to hold annual home
industry fairs, and between times rent the
pavilion for horse shows, other fairs and
entertainments.
The first plan submitted was by H. B.
Maggs. The front view of the building is
here presented. There will be, according
to the plans, a frontage of 175 feet and a
depth of 450. The main entrance will be
in the middle of the lot and on each side
will be two towers fifty feet square with
superstructures resembling inverted cones.
Over the middle of the building Till be a
large dome 100 feet in diameter and 100
feet high. Under the side towers will be
the ticket offices aud four artrooms fifty
feet square.
Through the center of the building will
extend an aisle 100 feet wide and on the
sides will be two aisles 37>Â£ feet wide.
Over these will be two galleries 40 feet
wide. For all this there will be 13,000
square feet of space for exhibits.

FIGURES ON IMMIGRATION
Major T. C. Ryan Quotes the
Census to Establish Cer
tain Claims.
VOTES OF THE CATHOLICS.
Charges That the Roman Church Has
Resorted to Colonization in
This Country.
A3 a result of the announcement that
Major T. C. Ryan of Ohio would deliver an
address, Metropolitan Hall wa^s well rilled
with believers in the A. P. A. movement.
Donald M. Ross, in introducing the
speaker, said:
I am sure that no word of mine is necessary
in introducing to you the speaker of the even
ing. There are two things I would like to
brine before you â two letters written by
priests on political matters. And you and "l
must agree, when we hear them read, they are
sufficiently important to bo alarming. In
Canada they are having a struggle that is cer
tainly alarming.
He referred to the remedial school
legislation inaugurated in Manitoba, ana
added that the leader of the Liberal or
opposition party in Canada, which was
fledged against separate tchools in Mani
toba, was a Catholic. He read a letter
said to have been addressed by A. La
combe, a Catholic Driest, to the opposition
leader asking him to use his power by
voting with the Government to secure the
passage of the measure for separate
schools and containing an implied threat
to defeat the opposition in the coming
September elections unless the opposi
tion did as desired on the school ques
tion- The other was a letter sail to
have been written to induce Catholics to
support the candidacy of Sir Charles
T upper in Canada.
Major Kyan Bpoke in part as follows:
Ladies and Gentlemen: lam certainly glad
to stand before this audience of intelligent
people in the discussion of this great question.
I would it were in my power to cause you to
look in en the smoking altars from which
holy incense has arisen until it rings out in
thunder tones what it has paid for American
liberty through the blood of our fathers. I
shall speak to you of Romanism ana its influ
ence on the immigration of this country.
It should be understood by everybody that
February, 1853, marks an epoch in American
history and in Romanism as well in the
United States, for' it was then that the great
Catholic convention met at Buffalo to discuss
a plan by which this Kepublic might be taken
for Komamsm. It was argued that the best
way was to remove the sÃlooon-keepers from
the East to the West and make them tillers of
the soil, but this failed of adoption.
But the Jesuitism of Catholicism prevailed,
and it succeeded in having passed by the body
a resolution to the effect that they would in
duce immigration to the large cities to increase
thÂ» Catholic voting power, and so control the
Stale and country for Romanism.
To show how they succeeded, I Khali, quote
statistics from our own Governmentâ from the
census of 1800. These show that during the
decade between 1880 and 1390 there came
from across the ocean 5,246,613 immigrants.
To this number must be added 1,032,345 who
came from Canada!.-. Out of this number no
less than 3,218,485 -.TÂ«re Roman Cut holies,
who came from the v. up*' countries of Europe,
where Rome has been Jhe teacher and where
most of the people caunot write or read their
own language. Ana of this number statistics
show that 655,482 were from Ireland.
It is a . matter of fact that thirty-six coun
ties in this country control the destiny of the
whole country, notwithstanding that there are
about 2500 counties in the United States.V
In New York State they have placed their
Catholic immigrants to the number of 1,153,
--130,-and. in six counties of that State there is
an aggregate of 880,995 Catholics. -
Continuing, he said Massachusetts had
been colonized with 714,627 Catholics, and
that in six counties of that State there
were no less than 640,374 of them who
always voted as a unit as dictated to by
the Catholic bishop. Maryland
credited with 157,420, Minnesota with
271,319, Missouri with 162,824, New Jersey
with 222,274, Rhode Island 0*3,755, Illinois
704,324, California 156,846, Ohio :)26,114,
Connecticut 152,945, Kentucky 92,504, Wis
consin 249,164 and Michigan with 222,261.
These immigrants, lie explained, were
concentrated mostly in the counties con
taining the largest cities in each State, and
the Catholics were thus enabled to virtu
ally control the election in these States,
and thus of the entire country, "for," he
added, "the thirty-six counties in the
States I have named have been populated
with devotees of the Holy Mother Church,
and these same thirty-six counties control
the destinies of these great United States.
It is a wonderful state of affairs when one-
tenth of the population should control all
the remainder. And I will venture to say
that 99 per cent of these Catholics vote
every year just as the archbishops di
rect." Continuing, he said:
It will be worth the attention of our people
to study this matter, and if the press will place
these figures before them Komauism will soon
die in this country.
I want to call your attention to another Â«Ã¼b
ject. Go to a libman Catholic bookbtore and
get a work by Balmes. Then turn to page 3'i4
or 325 and read the whole chapter to get
Rome's idea of what governments are. It de
fines them as being of two classesâ de jure and
de facto. The government de jure Is that
created and maintained by a representative of
God, and is the only legitimate government.
Ade facto government is the product of a
revolution and is illegitimate. Mark that fact
and consider how your Government was born.
Was it not created out of the throes of a revo
lution? Then it is an illegitimate form of gov
ernment. This book also poes on to say that it
is the duty of every food Catholic to endeavor
to Subvert such a government and bring it un
der the influence of the church. And this book
is a textbook in the Roman Catholic colleges.
Here the unsuspecting youth . is inculcated
with these infamous ideas.
You ask me why I will aot vote for a Roman
Catholic, and I say I will not vote for any man
who has been educated in institution*) which
Inculcate such treasonable doctrine. [Ap
plause.]
I have here a copy of a Catholic work on
theology that 1 vainly endeavored to purchase
in every large city of the United States. It con
sists of eight volumes. On one occasion it was
placed 011 the counter and I put my hands into
my pocket to takeout the $32 to pay for it,
when the bookseller asked me if I had a per
mit. 1 had to admit I had not, and he in
formed me that he could not sell it to me un
less I had a permit slsned by the priest of my
parish and countersigned by the Archbishop.
This hook I now show I linally secured through
the American Consul in Belgium. It is known
as Denngnes Theology, and is printed entirely
in Latin.
The speaker then quoted from it to
show, as he claimed, that the doctrine of
mental reservation was therein made a
part of Roman Catholicism, and would
permit an eve-witness of a murder to de
liberately testify falsely in reference to
that crime, if he felt so inclined, and that
any Catholic priest has the power to
absolve him from the sin of perjury. He
added:
I don't say that any Roman Catholic layman
in this City believes this doctrine, for he does
not read ihis work. If there is any inconsider
able number of our people who believe this
doctrine then my property, my character aud
my life is not sale from a witness on the stand,
a juror in the jury-box or the Judge on the
bench. But this work is a textbook for every
Catholic priest.
This great Government of ours is guilty in
permitting such textbooks to be used. There
ought to be a law prohibiting them being
used in this country.
Major Ryan also quoted from this work
as follows: "The validity of the organic
law of a country must be tested by the
church," and remarked:
Have you ever thought of the degradation
these doctrines will lead men to. There is
nothing that will illustrate the degradation
and humiliation of these poor people who are
chained to this organization.
In the New York Tablet, a Catholic paper,
published with the sanction of the Catholic
censors,m-e nnd the following: ''The church
is more than country." The man who indorses
this doctrine cannot be a good citizen of this
or any country on earth. If a man is disloyal
to his country he is disloyal to God. No man
can serve two masters. No man can become a
citizen of this country and still maintain alle
giance to the Pope of Rome.
Wben the people of Ireland show their abil
ity to govern themselves by throwing off the
rule 01 Kome, then I will be in favor of home
rule, but not till then. [Applause.] Home
rule for Ireland to-day means Rome rule, and
Rome rule nioaus a degrading state of slavery
to that power.
It is this Roman Catholic immigration that
I have spoken of that is meddling with our
Government and endeavoring to destroy it.
and it is to this same Roman immigrationthat
the politicians of tne country are catering. I
wish to soy that 1 have no hate for the Roman,
but Ido hate Romanism. God loves the sin
ner, but hates sin, and so I say that I hate not
the Roman, Dut Romanism.
Out of these pernicious Catholic doctrines
was born not only the man who murdered
President Lincoln, but the man who assassi
nated the President of France, the man who
shot dead Mayor llurnson of Chicago, the man
who slew l)r. Cxonin and threw his body iuto
the sewer. Out of these doctrines was born
Tammany, the worst organization that ever
existed iti this country. Out of this doctrine
was created the policeman of New York City
who, on a salary of #2000 a year, raised a
family and in a period of twenty ywars accu
mulated a fortuue of more than a quarter of a
million dollars.
ArroKtert for Forirprr.
James Oit, a haekinan, was arrested last
evening at the instance of the postal au
thorities and booked at the County Jail on a
charge of forgery. Three \ve<>ks ago Ott re
ceived a letter which contained a United States
postal order for $7. He had tne order cashed,
and a few days afier the Postmaster discovered
that he was liot the man to whom the letter
was addressed. Ott was notified that unless
lie returned the .*7 he would be arrested.
Xbll he refused to ao, hence his arrest.
STOCKTON WINS AGAIN
The Next A. P. A. Convention
to Be Held at the Chicago
of the Valley.
A Resolution by Which the Names of
Officers and Delegates Will Be
Sent to Father Yorke.
When the fourth day's session of the A.
P. A. convention opened yesterday Dele
gate Sam Jones of Mono offered the fol
lowing resolution :
Be it resolved by the Superior State Conven
tion of the American Protective Association
in convention assembled on this Uth day of
March, 189 G. that the names of the otiicers
elected by this State convention, together with
the names of tlie delegates to represent the A.
P. A.'s nt the Supreme Grand Council in the
city of Washington, D. C, in the month of
May, 1890, be eiiÃrossed and framed and for
warried with the compliments of this Superior
State Council to Peter C. Yorke of the City
and County of San Francisco.
On the conclusion of the readinjr of this
resolution by the secretary there were
fully 100 delegates on their feet to second
the resolution. The president recognized
Edwards of Trinity, who had his name re
corded as the seconder of me resolution.
Still the delegates clamored for recogni
tion yrnen / Hayes of San Bernardino, by
his enormous standing of 6 feet 3
inches and weight of 300 pounds, caught
the eye of the president. This delegate
offered an amendment, "That the photo
graphs of the officers and delegates be also
sent."
After an hour's satirical speech-making
on the political attitude of the Roman
Catholic church and the alleged treason
able work of the A. P. A.'s in their attempt
to destroy the political usefulness of that
church in the United States the question
waÃ withdrawn amid the greatest of mer
riment and laughter.
The question of the next place of meet
ine was then taken up by special request.
Governor Sheldon of Los Angeles, in a
glowing tribute to the iitness of his city,
advocated it as the best place, and prom
ised that should the convention decide to
go there the Los Angeles people would
foot all the bills and give the members of
the convention the keys of the city.
Delegate Cooms of Sacramento spoke of
his city and with priae and pleasure
pointed to the great victory of the people
of that place having elected an A. P. A.
Mayor. These remarks were the cause of
a wild outburst of applause and cheering.

State president, who spoke a good word
for his home and the success of the A. P.
A. vou-rs there.
Santa Cruz was put in nomination by
D. D. Bowman, who spread himself on the
beauties of his "Long Branch" of the
Pacitic.
Last, but not least Delegate R. V.
Swain, a gnod orator with a i>!easant face,
took the floor and nominated the "Chi
cago of the San Joaquin Valley" â Stock
ton. He told the delegates that they had
in his "Chicago" an A. P. A. Mayor who
was neither afraid or ashamed to own up
to his principles, and if the convention
would come there all the expenses would
be footed, and in addition thereto they
would be treated to a free ride to the end
of the new railroad and return with
a boom and 3 hurrah never before heard
on the bnnks of the San Joaquin River.
Stockton's chief executive indorsed Dele
pate Swain's remarks, whereupon Santa
Cruz withdrew in favor of Stockton. Oak
land and San Francisco followed suit.
On the result of a ballot Stockton won
by seventy-five votes. The declaration of
the result was followed by applause and
cheering.
The afternoon and evening sessions
were devoted to the reports of committees.
It is barely possible that the convention
will conclude its labors to-day.
A BOY'S APPEARANCE.
He Owes It to Himself to Be Cleanly and
Â»;it!y .Dressed.
Ruth Ashmcre, addressing herself to
"That Boy of Mine," in March Ladies'
Hon.e Journal, writes that his personal
appearance "should be pood. You o\fe
that to yourself. And whether it is at the
office or when you are out visiting you
should be a clean, wholesome-looking
young man. Cleanliness does much
toward godliness, and a clean body aids a
clean soul. It may not be in your power
to possess a dress suit, but if you should
not, don't borrow one and don t hire one.
Brush up the best clothes you have, make
them i mmaculate, and then enjoy your
self and forget your clothes. Your Jinen
can always be fresh and clean, and your
tie can be in good style and properly
knotted. Never wear a loud scarf and
never wear imitation jewelry. Gentlemen
select plain gold buttons, and simple gold
links, and scarfpins of the most modest
pattern. If you can afford dross clothes,
remember never to appear in them until
after dark. You may wear, as you like'
best, either a lawn tie or a black satin one,
but the stiff little bow should be looped by
yourself and not bought ready made."

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
What the Oarsmen, Athletes and
Cyclists Are Doing.
The sloppy condition of the roads lead
ing from this City to reports frequented by
the cyclists has put a stop to road runs for
a time at least. Patrons of wheeling are
now enjoying their leisure time watching
the last riders contesting for honor and
prizes ft the Pavilion.
The National Athletic Club will give its
second exhibition on Thursday evening,
which will consist of wrestling and Dozing
principally.
Rifle shooting is gaining rapidly in popu
larity, and as will be seen by a glance over
the department devoted to the rifle and
targets a number of clubs will be repre
senieu at the butts on Sunday.
The very latest news concerning rowing,
athletics, angling, coursing and kindred
sports will be found in the following
columns.
THE WHEELMEN.
Racing Board's Bulletin â Move
ments of the Record-Trial Teams.
There are two veiy good reasons why
the wheelmen will stay in town to-morrow.
In the first place the rains of the past week
have made the roads very sticky and ]*rac
tically unridable. Again, the indoor
tournament now in progress at the Me
chanics' Pavilion is such a strong attrac
tion that probably all the cyclists will
congregate there this afternoon and even
inc and to-morrow.
The success of the Pavilion meet thus
far is phenomenal. It is said that there
were more people present the opening
night, Thursday, t.han attended the show
last year for the entire week,, and last
night's crowd was fully as large, Every
seat in the house was sold in advance, and
the people packed the galleries, aisles and
every available space where a view of the
races couid be had.
On account of the number of fast profes
sional riders in town, it is probable that
Manager YVikidel will add several events
for them to the programme for to-morrow
afternoon and evening. Campbell, the
Oregon champion, who is a splendid rider,
and Osen of Han Jose, one of the fastest
"pro's"' in the world, are here and will be
glad of an opportunity to show their speed.
Tnere are several good local men who will
niakt= the pace hot for them, and some
pretty races should result.
Thus iarthe meet has gone along with
out an accident to speak of. Benson and
Downing, both of San Jose, fell Thursday
night. but came off with a few scratches
only. The track is perfectly safe, and the
men can make the turns on the steep
banks at a two-minute clip without fear of
dunger.
R. M. Welch of the National racing
board issued his bulletin No, 3 yesterday.
It is expected that he would have a num
ber of local riders to transfer :o profession
alism, but he has evidently not yet fully
satisfied himself as to the status of the
men here, for the only ones he has taken
action upon are the members of the Steams
racing team now at >Santa Monica. They
are all made professionals at their own re
quest. The bulietin is as follows:
BTTU.BTTK NO. 3.
Sanction to Mearns team to make private

I'niicr clause Bof amateur ruleâ (>. L. Pick
ar<l, Oakland.
By action of the K^neral assembly, the divi-
Bions of Northern and Southern California
will, so far as the amateur rule is concerned,
be regarded as separate States. No amateur
resident in one division will be allowed to
compete in the other at a distance greater than
t lt><Â» miles from his home, except in closed col
lege or association championships, or by .spe
cial permit of the racing board.
K. M. Welch,
Member of the National Racing Board.
It has been learned that there has been
quite a change down south regarding these
teams. The Syracuse team at Coronado
has disbanded. Wtflls and Terrill are here
competing at the indoor tournament, Mc-
Crea has returned to Los Angeles, Hamil
ton is going back to Denver, the quad
team will separate, and Manager Shafer is
going to Syracuse. The sextuplet used by
the team for record-breaking is now on its
way here and will be seen at the show next
week.
The Steams team, now at Santa Monica,
wili leave there to-day and try the track at
ban Diego just vacated ny the Syracuse
people. Being a mile dirt track it is
deem?d better for record trials than the
three-lap cement affair at Santa Monica.
Do not lend your bicycle. Once get yonr
wheel adjusted to suit your own peculiar
make-up, and then don't iet any one else
ride it. If you do you will get it back witn
the saadle-post "raised just a trifle or the
handle-bar "a little bit lower. ' Perhaps
your friend will have found the chain too
loose, or the bearings not quite as he
thinks they ought to be. At any rate,
nine times out of ten the borrower will
take liberties he wouldn't think of doing
with a rented whee.l. As Goddard would
say, '"Verbum sap.'*
The Bicycle Protective Association met
Thursday morning at 10 o'clock, but no
important business was transacted. It
was resolved to support the Pavilion tonr-

nament, which all the dealers consider a
splendid thine for the sport and trade.
It is a very good plan to occasionally
turn one's bicycle upside down and care
fully examine the outside of the tires.
Very often there will be noticed small cuts
in which grit or little fragments of stone
may be embedded. The cuts should be
cleaned out with a pointed piece of stick,
a little solution inserted and when the lat
ter is dry the cut closed up. An operation
nf this kind will take, perhaps, half an
hour once a month, and to return the tires
are rendered much more reliable and much
less likely to receive damaee.
B. C. Lennie, representative of a large
Chicago rubber house, and very popular
among the local wheeling cluba, will re
turn from an extended Eastern trip to-day.
While East Mr. l^ennie was married, and
he brings his bride with him. Joyce, Lo
zier and the rest of the Eastern contingent
located here will welcome "Bob" heartity
when he arrives.
The census returns show that there are
in the United States about 15,000,000 horses,
over L',OOO,UOO mules and 4i),000 asses. The
cost of food forthese animals is aboutsl,o7ti,
--000.000. On line stone roada one horse can
haul as much as three horses can haul
over the average dirt road of this country.
It is estimated that it would be necessary
to build about 1,000,000 miles of macad
amized road in the I'nited States in order
to have as good a system of public high
ways as is found in several Kuropean
States. At $4000 per mile th;s would in
volve an outlay of $4,000,000,000, a pretty
large sum of moivey.
But if a half of the draught animals
could t>e dispensed with by the building
of such roads there would b3 an annual
saving of $708,000,000 in the feed bill. Tnis
is 3 per cent interest on $3<>,000,090,000.
Consequently, if road bonds were issued

bearing 3 per cent interest more than
0,000,000 miles of macadamized road could
be built without increasing the annual ex
pense $1. The people are actually paying
:: per cent on |2H,000,000,000 in order to
keep up the present bad roads, while it
would not cost them a sixth of that sum
annually to build the 1,000.000 miles
needed in order to put this country on a
par with France iv the matter ol good
roads.
W. W. Xeedham of the Olympic Club
Wheelmen lias taken to the track again
after a rest of two years and is riding
nightly at the indoor tournament. Neeti
hani was a prominent racer of the Garden
City Cyclers some years ago before he
came to this City and ha 3 lost none of his
old-time speed.
The Barnes people are now constructing
at Syracuse a ten-seated machine, to be
called a "double quint." The frame will
have two top bars and three lower ones
and will easily hold four times the weight
of the ten men who will ride it. The chain
is composed of four chains side by side,
put together with long rivets, making it
practically a link belt. The chain is con
tinuous, and the rear sprocket-wheel is
built to stand the strain. The machine
will be ridden for the first time at the L.
A. W. National meet a: Louisville next
summer.
Last Sunday afternoon the following
ladies and gentlemen organized them
selves into a bicycle club, the name of
which has not yet been chosen, ana
elected as officers: Mrs. H. Allen, captain ;
J. C. Wilder, president; Mrs. A. S. Rhorer,
secretary; H. Van Dyke, sergeant-at
arms: tiie other members being: Mr. and
Mrs. William J. O'Brien, Mr. and Mrs. R.
B. Anderson, Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Wilder.
On Sunday, March 8, the club wiil have a
run to Haywards.
Nowadays you see little of the bow
backed scorcher. He seems to have
dropped out of existence with the silence
and quicKness whica made his presence
first felt. America takes pride In her i
straight-shouldered sons, strapping fel- '
lows with their nationality written In !
every line of their feature?." The bicycle !
stoop was regretted from the moment it j
was introduced. You no longer see, very !
seldom at least, wheelmen shooting along j
the country roads with heads bent over i
the handle bars, their tongues almost pro
truding for want of moisture, and a gen- !
eral lack of freshness and comfort about ;
them that should not be noticed about j
any wheelman. Low handle bars have |
seen their best day. In this ape the rider I
wants to sit upright to appreciate the
beauties of cycling. He wishes to gaze
about him, admire the scenery and feel i
that wheeling is doing him some good.
The applications of twenty members of
the Alpha (ladies') Cycling Club for mem
bership in the League of American \Vheel
men t were sent East by Secretary-Treas- I
urer Scovern yesterday. This being 75 per j
cent of the club's membership it thereby j
becomes a league club and is entitled (to
send a representative to the board of oHi- ,
cer3, a condition which has never hap- j
pened in any division of the league be- |
fore. Chief Consul Kerrigan says that J
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, MARCH 7, 18S6,
their delegate will be warmly welcomed,
and he is thinkine of deposing a certain
committee chairman, who is not as active
in his work for the league as he should be,
and appointing the Alpha's delegate in
his stead.
The economical advantage of belonging
to the league is evidenced every night at
the Pavilion tournament, when Teaeue
members, by presenting their membership
cards, are admitted at half price. It only
costs $1 a year to belong to the leaeue and
any one attending the cycle show every
night saves $1 75. Spalding.
ROD AND REEL.
Anglers Are Getting: Ready for the
Opening of the Season.
A dispatch wa3 received last Wednesday
by a prominent angler of this City that a
fres-h run of steelheads into Paper-mill
Creek caused a rush of bait fishermen to
the deep pools "wherein the fishes were
resting, and that several were taken.
The dispatch did not say whether the
steelheads were small or large, but it is
presumed that the run was made up of
large fish.
A few local anglers took passage for the
happy casting ground just as soon as the
news arrived here, but nothing in the way
of news lias been received since their de-
parture. Possibly the steelheads have de-
parted from the big tidewater pools to the
spawn ing Deas up stream. Anyhow, it is
a well-established fact that the breeding
lishes which vo ddenly make their appear
ance in the brackish waters of the Paper
mill Creek during weekdays are generally
conspicuous by their absence on Sundays',
when the army of bait and spoon casters
from this City put in an appearance.
It will not* be many weeks when the
angler who firmly believes that protection
to the breeding fishes means good sport to
all lovers of the pastime during tne spring
and summer months will have an oppor
tunity of whipping old and favorite
waters.
The first of April is not very far off and
on that great "all fools'" occasion there
will be a happy meeting of old friends on
the verdant banks of streams and rreeks
which, for many seasons, have been the
stamping grounds of a fraternity whose
love for angling seems to be innate.
In April the trees will be in full bloom
and the sweet odor of divers wild flowers
will add materially to the enjoyment
lovers of the quiet and pleasurable art of
trout-catching will derive from an outing
in tbe mountains.
It is hardly to be expected that the
anglers who cling tenaciously to rly-fish
ing as beine; the only true and sportsman
like manner of catching trout will enjoy
good success during A^ril. Possibly, if
fine weather continues, fly-casting may
prove tolerably successful, but generally
speaking the worm, roe or spoon will ac
complish the desired end, which means a
good basket of iisu.
According to the present outlook the
streams which promise to pan out best are
within close proximity of the San Fran
cisco and North Pacific Coast. Railroad.
The Pieta, Sulphur and some other creeks
in the vicinity of Cioverdale should yield
good messes of trout during theope'ning
days of the season. It is doubtful if the
once famous Paper-mill and Lagunitas
creeks will prove worttiy of much atten
tion this year owing to the long spell of
dry weather, which kept the streams low,
and thereby prevented the breeding fishes
from reaching their spawning beds.
As previously stated in The Call, the
Fish Commissioners should give more at
tention to the stocking of streams that are
extensively fished during tlft open season.
When the La Motte fish hatchery was
stationed on Sonoma Cieek, above the
town of Glen Ellen, that stream was un
questionably noted for its excellent trout
rishing; out of Jate years it has received a
black eye because of its scarcity of fishes.
Streams within near reach of this City re
quire stocking annualiy, and when the
Fish Commissioners will give the creeks
that are yearly becoming worse some at
tention^the angling fraternity will not fail
to appreciate the work that is being done
in their behalf.
It is said that a part of Los Gatos Creek
will be dammed this year, so as to give
picnickers an opportunity of enjoying
boat-rowins. An angler writes to the
sporting editor to know if the owners of
the pleasure park propose putting in a fish
ladder in the proposed dam. Possibly the
Fish Commissioners can answer the ques
tion.
An exchange recently published the fol
lowing: The most curious creature of the
worm family is the diplbzoon, a singular
parasite which infests the gills of several
species of fish, particularly the bream.
Each individual diplozoon has two dis
tinct bodies, united in the middle so as to
form a perfect St. Andrew's cross, each
half of the creature containing precisely
the same kind of organs, viz. : an alimen
tary canal, a venous system, reproductive
organs, etc.
The Fly-casting Club will hold its sec
ond meeting at the Olympic Club in a few
days. In all probability the casting tour
nament win be held in Sutros baths. The
lake in which the boats used in shooting
the chutes dash into was suggested, but
it is hardly possible that the the contests
will be held there.
THE OARSMEN.
Ladles of the Pioneer Club Who
Practice on Sunday Mornings.
The recent Lake Merritt regatta has
warmed the oarsmen up to their sport
considerably, and, although no regattas
are set for the immediate future, the
various boat clubs are already at work
developing material that will form the
nucleus of this season's racing cre^s.
The main ambition of the local clubs
seems to De to lower the colors of the
South End senior barge oarsmen, who
have been victorious in every race tuey
entered.
Their easy defeat of the University crew
in the Lake Merritt regatta stamps them
as the finest four-oared barge crew ever
turned out on this coast.
The crew is under the captaincy of
Robert Mac Arthur, the well-known ath
lete, and the South End Club is ready to
back it against any crew on the coast, the
Pioneers preferred.
The Bob Cook stroke, which is used by
the University crew, is pronounced in
ferior to the long, swinging stroke of the
South End crew.
The University boys are by no means
discouraged over their defeat, but say
they have gained much from the race in
the way of pointers on their boat and
their stroke.
The winners of the various events in the
Lake Merritt regatta have been presented
with their prizes, which are beautiful
watches and which were well worth the
effort made to win them.
On Tuesday evening, April 7, the Ariel
Boating and Swimming Club will hold an
entertainment and dance at Union-square
Hall.
The ArieJs have been making consider
able improvements in their Ooathouse.
An addition has been built on the aide for
the accommodation of the Whitehalls,
and the interior of the house is embel
lished with large portraits of renowned
oarsmen.
Several members of the club are becom
ing yachting enthusiasts, and there is a
rumor afloat that the club intends to form
a yachting annex.
The Dolphins are determined to make a
showing in the next regatta. They are
offering every inducement for the strong
armed pullers of North Beach to join their
club.
James B. Keenan has presented the club
witti a handsome club flag, and Mr. Lotliin
will donate to it an extremely large
American flag.
J. Marron, G. Sullivan, Fred Woernor,
W. (>. Patch and J. Cronin will represent
the Dolphins in the junior contests of che
coming reuatta.
The swimming race between Mr. yon
Hadlen and Jack Kirby, both of the
Dolphins, is now off. as Mr. Kirby is in
Sacramento and obtained a six months'
leave of absence.
The Pioneer Club has purchased the
barge, J. JR. McDonald, the property of
some club members, and intends to fit it
up for the bloomer crew.
The bloomer crew are improving won
derfully, and are already able to give some
01 the crews that spin along Long Bridge
Sunday mornings a lively brush.
The gins go out every Sunday, and it
matters little to them whether they row
along the calm inshore waters or thÂ« more
troublesome waters of the center of the
bay.
THE RIFLE.
Clubs That Will Be Represented at
the Ranges To-Morrow.
There is an interesting programme of
events billed fur to-morrow at the Shell
Mound range. The San Francisco Schuet
zen Verein and the Germania Schuetzen
Club will hold their regular medal shoots.
The Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club will
hold its semi-monthly medal and prize
contents with pistols, revolvers and rifles.
The monthly medal shoot of the Inde
pendent Rifles will also take Dlace. Com
panies A, M, F and X will send out their
marksmen for practice, and the Nationals
(Companies C and G) will hold their regu
lar monthly class shooting. One of the
principal events will be the monthly
bullseye shoot of the Xord-Deutscher
Schuetzen Verein, at which event it will
be decided who has won the beautiful
medal presented by Captain L. Siebe, the
proprietor of the range. The medal will
go to the sharpshooter making the three
best bullseyes during the twelve bullseye
shoots of the club.
A beautiful medal will be shot for by
the San Francisco Schuetzen Verein for
the marksman making the most centers
durine: the year. This medal will be pre
sented by Huber .Bros., proprietors of the
California Hall at(>2o Bush street.
The San Francisco and the Oakiand police
are doing considerable Dard practice at
Shell Mound for the coming pistol match
between picked teams from the two de
partments.
At the recent election of officers of the
Norddeutsr.her Schuetzen Club the fol
lowing were selected for the ensuing year:
Fresident, George Alpers; vice-president,
Ludwig Siebe; secretary, August Brune;
treasurer. John Peters; shooting masters,
John de Witt and E. Barruth.
THE ATHLETES.
Men In Training for Championship
Gamesâ The Seattle Club.
A number of Olympic Club athletes
who are infatuated with outdoor sport
will visit Ihe outdoor grounds to-morrow.
The running paths are being placed in
first-class condition for the sprinters, and
Caretaker Mclntyre expects to see the
pretty park crowded with athletes during
the spring days, training for games that
will be he!d in the near future.
Latest intelligence from the Stanford
University is to the effect that a strong
team of athletes will be in the field this
year to compete against the clubs of the
Pacific Althletic Association in champion
ship contests. The Berkeley University
will not be found sleeping, as its athletes
propose to commence training just as soon
as the cinder path will be ready to prac
tice on.
The Reliance Club will, also have some
eood men who will compete under its col
ors. The president of the Seattle Athletic
Club, who has been on a visit to this City,
stated to Dr. Short, the leader of the Olym
pic Club, that in all probability a team of
athletes and boxers from the Northwest
will journey to this City and contest in the
boxing tournament and also the games
held in May at the club's grounds.
It is quite probable that some of the
athletes from the Fresno and Los Angeles
clubs will be among those who will con
test at the annual championship meeting.
The following letter to The Call from
the secretary of St. Mary's College Ath
letic Club of Oakland is self-explanatory:
The election of officers of St. Mary's
College Athletic Association was held last
Tuesday evening. The following young
gentlemen were elected for the ensuing
term: Hugh 8. Dimond, president;
J.William Solen, vice-president; Joseph
M. O'Donnell, secretary; and Joseph *L.
Taaffe, treasurer.
The newly elected officers are men who
have always taken an active interest in
colleee athletics, and under their able
supervision the spring field day to be held
in May promises to be one of the most
successful in the history of the associa-
THE BOXERS.
Sullivan May Referee the Sharkey
and Gregsralns Contest.
On Thursday evening the second exhi
bition of the National Athletic Club will
be held at the Bush-street Theater, and as
the star event of the evening will be a
brilliant affair, doubtless a Jarge gathering
of sport lovers will be present.
In all probability the ereat John L. Sul
livan will be selected to referee the match.
Both Sharkey and Greggains are well
satisfied to have the Boston boy pass judg
ment on them when they have finished
their eight rounds. J. Ross Jackson, the
president of the club, is sanguine that
Thomas Shaikey.
Greggains and Sharkey will put up the
greatest fistic contestâ 'hat is, from a
scientific point of viewâ that has been seen
in this City in many years.
Experts who have seen Sharkey punch
ing the bag say he is a terrific hitter and
will surely put the fireman to sleep If he
happens to land on the right spot. Greg
gains is as shifty on his pins as Corbett
and will keep Sharkey guessing where
and how he can place one of his favorite
right-hand punches to produce effect.
Following the main event of the evening
Dal Hawkins and Phil McGoldrich will
box eight rounds for a purse. The pro
ceeds of the evening will be given to the
Children's Hospital.
John L. Sullivan, the ex-champion
heavy-weight pugilist, will arrive in this
City to-day in the company of Paddy
Ryan, the "old Trojan." Commencing on
Monday the two popular men of pugilistic
fame will appear in a boxing exhibition at
the Columbia Theater for one week only.
Sullivan is said to be looking well and is
very anxious to have an opportunity of
shaking hands with his old friends, who
are many in this City.
Sullivan will always be looked upon
by the sporting fraternity as the greatest
fighter that ever stepped between ropes.
For twelve years he held the champion
ship of the world against all comers. For
twelve years he went about the country,
not begging for a big purse to be put up,
but offering $1000 to any man who would
last four rounds with him. He waÂ« the
idol of the sporting world, and that night
when it was reported over the wires that
the great John L. had been conquered by
James J. Corbett thousands of hearts were
made sad. It is true his profession was
one which many condemn, but there were
but few people in the United States who
rejoiced over the Boston boy's defeat, for
Sullivan was not alone a fighter such as
the world has seldom seen, but he fought
for glory and not for filthy lucre, and
fought like a man. The money which he
earned he gave away, but for iwelve years
he lived like a prince, and then met defeat
at the hands of a man who had the good
fortune to win the title of champion, but
who apparently lacked the courage to de
fend it, and gave it away to an alien.
The following editorial on law-makers
and prize-fighters recently appeared in the
Chicago Chronicle:
Somewhere down on the border line between
Alex Greggains.
Texas and Mexico, where are lacking the two
features absence of which is said to make
sheol disagreeableâ water and good society â
several muscular persons hope publicly to
Datter each other into a comatose condition in
the presence of several hundred other persons
who have wagered money on the result. There
won't be a tithe of tbe money wagered that
changes hands on a general election. Not
half tne blood will be shed in the "fistic
arena" that is annually poured forth by colle
gians on the day set aside by official proclama
tion as a fit season for giving thanks to God for
all his mercies. Yet the likelihood that this
entirely commonplace exhibition of man in
the exercise of his brutal abilities only might
be given on the soil of a United States Terri
tory has stirred the Congress of the United
States to such a burst of statesmanlike zeal as
never before has been manifested. A bill pro
hibiting prize-fighting in the Territories} of
the United States passed both houses of Con
gress in one day and was dispatched to the
President for his signature within forty-eight
hours of its first suggestion.
Suppose this measure had been a claim for
just damages due a citizen from the National
Government. The ghost of poor old "Billy"
McGarrahan could testify that in such event it
would probably drag along for decades. Sup
pose it had to do with reforming the currency
system or the taxing system of the Govern
ment. In such event the Senate would tack a
free coinage amendment to it and thus weight
ed, it would sink down into oblivion. How
many years have been spent in the effort to get
congressional action, pro or cou, on topics of
National or local importance ! How inconsist
ent it is that the Congress which is utterly im
potent to enact laws for the relief of the treas
ury is instantly ready to legislate for the
stoppage of a boxing match.
The prize-fighters injure few people but
themselves and injure themselves but little
Ihe moral harm done indirectly by tneir ex
hibition of the concussionary force of the
human fist does not greatly over-balance the
benefit accomplished by their wide teaching of
the doctrine that to have a round body a
regular life, abstinence from alcohol and a
simple diet are necessary. Every Congress
does the Nation more harm than a dozen
"fistic tournaments." The eagerness Qf the
statesmen to stop this particular evil suggests
that they desire to
Compound for sins they are inclined to
I'.y damning those they hiwe no mind to.
A well-regulated prizefight has one merit
which might well be impressed upon Con
gress â the principals have to do something or
quit. They can't filibuster and they' cannot
set up a dummy between them to pound in
stead of pounding each other. It would be an
exceedingly good thing If somebody could
"Hold the watch" on this do-nothing Congress
and call time.
In spite of the apparent decadence of
pugilism in this country, there are strong
indications that it is not to become a lost
art and sport so readily as its opponents
desire. In the Massachusetts Legislature
there was recently introduced a measure
known as the anti-sport bill, which was
designed to put a stop not only to boxing,
brut to all rough sports. The effect has
been to arouse strong opposition. At a
hearing given by a legislative committee
recently the weignt of the testimony was
greatly against the bill, and this was fol
lowed by a large protest, signed by some
of Boston's most influential citizens,
against the passage of the measure. The
position taken by them is that as between
really scientific boxing and downright
brutal pugilism there is a broad distinction.
On the other hand, advocates of the bill
contend that so long as boxing is permitted
it is next to impossible to prevent prize
fights. The remarkable feature of the con
troversy is the unexpected strength which
the friends of the "manly art" have de
veloped in a city where the strict prin
ciples of the Puritans are supposed still to
prevail.

THE ROSEWALD MEMORIAL
A Lecture That Carried Out
the Late Musician's Last
-'}'i. Wish.
An Interested Audience Listens to
Instructive Remarks and Good
Music.
The last lecture written by the late Pro
fessorÃosewald was read yesterday after
noon by Professor Bernard -Moses at the
Colnrabia Theater for the benefit of: the
Rosewald memorial fund, tributary to the
student* 1 loan fund of the State Univer
sity.
â  The lecture, which was on descriptive
and characteristic music, was - finished py
Professor Kosewald only a few hours be
fore his death. He had intended to de
liver it for the benefit of the needy stu
dents of the State University, and it.was
owing to Mme. Rosewald's energetic desire
to carry out her late husband's last wishes
that yesterday's benefit took place.
â¢ A graceful tribute was paid to the mem
ory of the musician who had written the
â¢ lecture by having an excellent picture of
him placed on the stage. Some able musi
cians had given their services to illustrate
the lecture accordiug to the writer's inten
tions, and both Professor Rose wald's text
and the musical illustrations were listened
to with marked interest by a fairly large
audience. .
.In addition to being interesting, the lec
ture was extremely instructive, though
the educational portions of the remarks
were conveyed so pleasantly and led so
naturally up to the illustrations that the
audience did not feel for a moment any
painful conviction of being taught. Music
wa* defined in the lecture, and its effects
on persons of different temperament were
pleasantly and interestingly described.
".Music, acknowledged as it is to be the
divinest art, should do more than please.
This is the' effect, but what is ltd cause?
We find this in the secret thoughts of the
composer." â¢â â 'â â â¢-. " , â 
Music was divided into characteristic
and descriptive music, the former tending
to 'idealism and the latter an open book,
plain to all. Some interesting experi
ments of the effect of music on idiots were
given, the writer stating that he had Der
eonally investigated and had found these
mentally afflicted people to be affected by
variations in melody and rhythm. - ' "?
People who were not weak-minded, but
whose souls were not moved by concord of
sweet sounds, were also dealt with. "Friv
olous people," the audience was told,
â¢â¢like jingling music. ; Choleric, vivacious
people are addicted to quick music with
plenty of movement in it. and those of
phlegmatic temperament are more occu
pied iD counting how lone it will take to
play the piece than they are in enjoying
the music." .-..-â  . "â â  ... .
Five performers furnished ; the lUustra
tiohi Sigmund Beel cave a brilliant ren
dering of the Saint Saen's "Andante and
Rondo Capriccioso," and his; rendering of
Leon de, St. Lubin's setting of the -sextet
from the "Lucia" was also a remarkable
piece of work, ' for the whole six voices
denied to sing from his violin. Miss Aaa
WeigeJ played two Chopiu pianoforte solos
well. 13. Jauius played a J reverie by Jen
'â¢". excellently. as a violin s solo. Miss L.
Morey and Frank Coffin were the vocal
ists; the former won applause for the
"Lorelei" and "The Erl Kiag." but the
latter was scarcely in Ids element with the
Meyerbeer scene and romance; "â  ',
WILL RON FOR GRIFFIN
The Ex-Jockey Secures Colonel
Wheeler Out of a Selling
Event.
THEEE FIEBT CHOICES WIN.
Kowalsky, a Hot Favorite, Beaten by
the 10 to i Outsider MidloâGrat
ify Won Easily.
The firm of Burns <fe Waterhouse seems
to be singularly unfortunate in having its
horses entered la selling races bid up.
Trainer '"Jimmy" McCormick appears to
be an adept at placing the horses under his
chare?, but every now and then these
"soft spots" prove a trifle expensive. Yes
terday the stable had Colonel Wheeler, a
youngster, by imp. Midlothian, that has
won all of the races he started in most im
pressively, entered in the four-furlong
dash. The company was very ordinary
and the colonel was a 3 to 5 chance, which
looked a very long price. He won as he
pleased, with Gordon, a black colt, owned
by "Tom" Griffin, finishing in the place.
Griffin once lost the stake horse, Henry
Young, out of a selling event, and so badly
ruffled were nis feelings on that occasion
that he has ever since been on the lookout
for horses that he considered "out of line,"
especially when one of his own happened
to finish behind one of that class. Colonel
Wheeler was entered to be sold for $700,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 7, 3896.
and in gentle lifts the ex-jocKÂ»y Did him
up to $2000, at whioh figure the stable
ceased bidding and the youngster changed
owners. As half of the run-up money re
verts to the owner of the aecond horse,
Griffin undoubtedly secured quite a bar
gain.
The card was made up entirely of selling
events. Favorites reached the wire in
front on three occasions. The downfall of
Kowalsky, a very warm choice, was one
of the unexpected defeats of the day.
The opening event was a six-furlong
sprint, with twelve facing the issue. Little
Jimmie ruled a 2 to 1 choice, with San
Marco next in demand. Mosier, from the
stable of A, B. Spreckels made his first
appearance and was backed down from 10
to 1^ to 1. Franco was in front for a
quarter, when San Marco took the lead
and, never headed, won easily a length be
fore Mosier. Adios, an outsider, "was a
fair third.
The next event was also a six-furlong
run, with Artist going to the post a 2 to I
favorite. Senator Hoffman, with his usual
showing of speed, showed the way to the
stretch, where the favorite supplanted him
and ridden out beat Walter J a length.
Tobey, a backed good thing, was never
: dangerous.
The fourth race at the same distance
looked a certainty for Kowalsky, and the
backers of the brown colt accepted 3 to 5
as a good price. Eddie Jones astride of
j Midlo, who had gradually wandered back
in the betting until his odds reached 10 to
1, took the outsider out in the lead, with
Garner on the favorite taking matters
easy behind him, waiting for the Mid
lothian gelding to stop as he is wont to do.
it happened to be one ot the days that he
I wa& not tuus afflicted, and Garner awak
: ened to this fact when it was too late, for,
i tardy at making his ride, the Urst choice
â  was beaten out a head on the wire. Pique
i finished a fair third.
For the last event, at seven furlongs, the
Westchester stable's Gratify was thewarm
i est sort of a favorite. Opening at evens,
1 his odds were speeaily forced dawn to 3 to

POMONA'S MARSHALSHIP.
A Fight for the Position Evolves
Some New Legal
Points.
Some Irregularity Is Permitted, Pro
vided There Is Not Enough to
Amount to Fraud.
The Supreme Court has affirmed the de
cision of the Superior Court in the case of
Thomas B. Atkinson against John W.
Loobeer, a contest for the position of Mar
shal in the city of Pomona. The decision
is interesting from the way in which it
treats of the application of the election
laws.
The plaintiff wanted the entire vote ol
the Second Ward thrown out. This gave
Loobeer a majority of 051, but without it
Atkinson would have been elected. At
kinson wanted the vote thrown out on the
ground of irregularities. Me showed that
when the polls were closed| the election
officers cleared the room of all but two
bystanders and kept the rooms locked for
over half an hour while one of the judges
of election was absent. During that time
they counted the ballots in the ballot-box,
and finding there was one more ballot in
the box than tnere were voters on the poll
list, they de&troyed one. They also sealed
up the unnsed ballots and made all prepa
rations for the canvais, but did not pro
ceed to tally the votes. At the return of
the absent jud^e of election the doors were
opened and in the presence of the crowd
the tallying was commenced.
In commenting on the demand to de
clare void the vote of the whole ward for
the reasons given the Supreme Court says:
Election coutestd arising out of irregulari
ties of election officers frequently prt-stnt to
courts the alternative of either setting aside as
in the case iv hand the honest and clear expres
sion of the will of tbe majority of the voters or
of so construing the election laws as to open
the door to future frauds which it Is the pur
pose ot those laws to prevent. Of course,
neither the voters nor those voted for have any
control over election officers, and to set aside
the vole of a precinct where there was ciearly
no fraud nor any miÃtake affecting the results
for mere irregularities occasioned by the ig
norance or carelessness of election boards
wouid la many cases be a patent injustice.
Moreover, a. construction requiring an exceed
ingly strict compliance with all statutory pro
visions might tt mpt to irregularities contrived
for the very purpose of vitiating the vote at a
certain polling place, and it might lead to
more fraud than it would prevent.
On the other band, statutory provisions
which are clearly mandatory must be substan
tially complied with, aud even directory pro
visions cannot be so grossly departed J-'mas
to make It impossible or extremely difÃc.it to
determine whether fraud had been committed
or anything done which would affect the
result.
The provision whicb the contestant
claims bad been violated was that re
quiring an immediate canvass iv the pres
ence of the bystanders. It reads :
As soon B3 the polls are finally closed the
judges must immediately proceed to canvass
the votes given at Mich election. The canvass
must be public in the presence of bystanders.
This statute, tne court says, is merely di
rectory, and was not so grossly violated iv
the case at bar as to amount to fraud.
The decision of the lower court is there
fore affirmed.
It is claimed that unlesÂ» the demand for
the plumage of such birds as the white
heron, birds of paradise, humming-bird
and many other feathered beauties ceases
they will soon become extinct.
CHEAPER BITUMEN NOW
Last of the Thirteen Suits Against
the Bitumen Consolidated
Company.
THE CORPORATION BROKEN UP.
An Interesting Story of the Organiza
tion and Operations of the
Company.
On Monday morning next the two last
suits of the thirteen which have brought
about a complete disruption of the Bitu
men Consolidated Mining Company will
come up for trial before Superior Judge
Seawell.
The history of the case is replete with
interest for lawyers and laymen alike. It
is the old story of personal interests and
jealousies in conflict with business advan
taees, but like the venerable narrative of
love always commands respectful atten
tion.
Thirteen suits have been instituted, tried
and all but two disposed of, and thereby
is pendent the tale. From its inception
the corporation began a pace-setting stride
on the highway to prosperity, according to
thedefendantdirectorsand their attorneys.
The Bitumen Consolidated Mining Com
pany was organized in September, lS'jl.
Prior to that tirue Austin Walrath owned
a productive &nd very profitable bitumen
mine near banta Cruz. A. C. Bassett,
Timothy Hopkins and J. A. Fairchilds
owned and operated the Consolidated
Bituminous mine in San Luis Obispo
County, together with the mines of the
Ban Luis Obispo Bituminous Rock Com
pany. Both the mines were profitable,
though competition was lively between
these throe mines and that of J. H. Swift
near Santa Cruz..
It was this same competition that even
tually led the controllers of the entire
source of bitumen production of the coast
to consider the feasibility of consolidating
and keeping up rates. Accordingly, in
1891, they pooled their issues under the
corporate appellation of the Bitumen Con-
Rolidated Mining Company. The capital
actually invested by Messrs. Walrath,
Bassett, Hopkins, Fairchilds, Swift and
Perrni is said to have been but $s<X> each.
On that basis a business of $100,000 was
done the nrt>t year. All they had to do in
dividually was to intrust the affairs of the
company to a competent manager and
draw down something like $17,000 each at
the end of every twelve months. Five
year contracts were made with all the
"paving companies of San Francisco, LO3
Angeies, San Diego, Stockton, Sacramento,
FresQO, Portland, Seattle, Tacoma, Salt
Lake City ami other towns on the coast.
The company agreed to deliver the rock
free on bo<ud tne cars at about $4 a ton,
and the contractors were willing and
anxious to enter into a rive-year agree
ment.
A happier state of affairs could not have
been conceived by any member of the com
bine. Prices were not high and the trade
in that particular product from nature's
subterranean laboratory was as brisk as
could be desired. "But personal ambition
and jealousies," so says one of the attor
neys, "interjected a discordant element,
slight at hrst, like the cloud no bigger than
a man's hand, but destined to overshadow
the peace and temporary prosperity of the
corporation's members. "
"Mr. Walrath was the first to take ac
tion," said Attorney Frank Sb ay yester
day, "though the position he assumed had
nothing to do with the disorganizing suits
which followed later on. It seems that
several of the paving companies preferred
the Walrath rock to that from some of
the other mines. The result may be snr
mised. The Walrath mine was worked
for all it was worth. Most of the rock fur
nished the paving companies came from
that mine, but the original owner received
no more tnan the other members of the
combine whose mines were all but idle.
According to the original agreement, a
royalty of $1 a ton was to be incorporated
iv a common pool and. shared equally
among the members. The royalty was for
the rock taken from the mines singly and
collectively. When Mr. Walratn saw
that his mine was yielding up rock and
royalties faj in excess of the other mines
he naturally demurred and demanded
restitution from the company. His de
mand prevailed, and the white dove of
peace once more perched on his standard
and Happed its wings in the faces of the
directors whenever the spirit moved them
to meet and congratulate one another on
the ease and facility with which they were
adding $17,000 a year to their respective
bant accounts.
"But fate was in an unkind mood and
frowned on the members of the Bitumen
Consolidated Mining Company over the
shoulders of Messrs. Bassett and Swift.
Basse tt wanted to dictate the policy of the
management and Swift wanted to sup
plant Fairchilds as manager. The iatter
was maKing $100,000 a year for the con
cern, and the directors had very properly
voted him a salary of $75u a month. Swift
offered to perform the same service for
$250 a month. The other directors, ex
cepting Bassett, politely but emphatically
informed him that they would not give
him the position if he paid the corpora
tion $250 for the privilege.
"Oh, but it is a racy story," continued
Mr. Shay, laughing, after a short pause
given up to amused rumination. "Bassett
and Swift saw|| they could not dominate
the other four directors, and they decided
to kick over the traces entirely. If their
four associates would not think as they
did it devolved on them to make the
others evolve thouehts that should be in
perfect harmony. The thirteen suits show
the method they employed.
"Before this, however, Bassett, as secre
tary, refused to sign warrants and checks..
As the constitution provided that all
checks and warrants must- be signed by
the secretary and president the directors
had to pass a resolution providing that
money could be paid out if the signatures
of the president (Walrath) and man
ager (Fairchiids) were attached to the war
rants.
"That resolution was a baiker and Mr.
Bassett cogitated. The result was a suit.
In the complaint the other four directors

petition was instituted. Lately some of
the mines have been furnishing rock at a
price 50 cents less than the cost of the
mining.

legal disintegration cannot take place

BEFORE THE GRAND JURY.
Captain Lees Presents the Testimony
in the Butler Miller Case.
i Captain Lees has turned over to District
Attorney. Barnes the full transcript of the
testimony taken before the Coroner's jury,
at the inquest over trie remains of the
unknown killed by Frank Miller, one
month ago.
The case promises to be interesting in so
much as Miller, a butler in the employ of
J. L. Franklin, will be backed by the influ
ence and wealth of his master, who be
lieves he killed a bona-tide burglar. Cap
tain Lees, on the other hand, believes that
Miller simply decoyed a tramp to the
house and murdered , him, hoping /to . in
gratiate himself into the affection of
Franklin. It is to secure an indictment by
the Grand Jury, and have the case come
up regularly before tne Superior Court
that the testimony has been submitted for
perusal to the District Attorney.

the dealing-) until the last hour of business, when
fairly large amounts of Tobacco came upon the

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., March Wheat started In
this morning to give a repetition of yesterday's
dullness, and comparing the two sessions it was
diflicuk to decide just which was most inactive.
There was the difference, however, that where
predominating tone was firm yesterday to-day it
was weak and prices received- their only support
from '-puts." Liverpool quotations were unsatis
factory and that evidently formed the basis for the
weakness which existed. Northwestern receipts
were liberal at 431 cnrs against 485 last Friday
and 323 a year ago. Chicago received 46 cars and
Inspected out 156,313 bushels.
a inoderateqiiamity of cash wheat was worked for
Shipment to point* South and southwest, the knowl
edge of which imparted a little steadiness to the
market. Closing Paris cables were lower and Ber
lin and Antwerp unchanged. Export clearances
were iai.- at 330,643 bushels. Within thirty min
utes of the close there developed intense weak
ness and considerable "long" wheat came out, one
large line attracting much attention. Prices de
clined sharply at. the close, resting at the extreme
low point of" the day. May wheat opened from
667 c to GS^Jc, declined to 65 : c > where It closed,
13/ s 'c under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow 75 cars.
. CORNâ Began the session by displaying a firmer
tone and an advancing Inclination, but prices were
no: proof against the weakness of wheat, which
Insinuated Itself into all the surrounding pits. The
receipts were SOT cars, fifty less than expected,
and 99,488 bushels were taken from store. Liver
pool cables were quiet and sternly. Export clear
ances were light at 97.183 bushels. May corn
opened a; 303 B e. declined to and closed at 301 B <a}
;j(ii 4 a shade under yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow 500 cars.
OATSâ Offered iltttle resistance to the heavy
feeling which permeated the other markets and
which extended to them (oats). Really very little
business was transacted and the pit whs almost de
serted. Receipts were 182 cars and 47.063 bushels
were taken from store, May oats closed yÂ«@V4c
. under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor
row -07 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash, 89 Vic; May, 90c.
Receipts were 20 cars.
PROVISIONSâ Lower prices were established In
pork, the feeling of depression prevailing on the j
Boor and a decline In live hogs both combined pre
venting any exhibition of firmness in this market.
May pork closed 10@12Vae lower, May lard 2VaÂ©

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V..' March 6.â R. G. Dun it
Co., In their weekly review of trade, will say to
morrow: Failures for the week have teen 285 in
the United States, against 234 last year; and 68 in
Canada, against 68 last year.
The Cuban resolutions and the appointment of
receivers for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad were
events of sufficient importance to affect at most
any genuine market, especially for securities. It
therefore argues either remarkable strength of
conditions or an entire want of life and' genuine
ness In the market that the prices of the sixty
most active railroad stocks, which averaged $49 74
per share February 1. have never fallen lower than
9 49 36. nor risen above 50 85 per share.
The market is largely under the control of ope
rators who cannot afford to see It decline much,
but it is also true that the vote on Cuba and the
! receivership had both been ' discounted. The
strength of the market is largely due to more sat
isfactory reports of railway earnings. The volume
of business reflected by clearing-house exchanges
is not materially improving, the week's returns
showing a cain of only 6.5 per cent over last year
and a decrease of ) 7.6 per cent in comparison with
the same week of 1893. It must yet be broadly
stated that business appears to improve only in
prospect and in the . confidence lon which future
transactions may lie based, bat not as yet in actual
sales accomplished.
The Industries all. report a slightly lower range
of prices, except for iron and steel prod nets, and
it is noteworthy that while combinations in struc
tural beams and wire and â  cut nails are advancing
the quotation for Bessemer pig has fallen to $12 40
nt Pittsbnrg. and â¢ southern -No. 2 is offered at
$7- 75 delivered at Birmingham, and billets have
sold at $17 at Pittsbnrg. The bar combination
which raised prices not long ago finds an Increas
ing part Of the business absorbed by outside works.
The demand for no class of iron products is at this
time brisk, but large structural business is ex
pected in the spring, end there. Is still much hope
fulness stout railroad orders, as earnings continue
to rove. . â â Â-â 
The reports of the coot and shoe interests are not
on the whole more encouraging â  this week, ship
ments from the tast being still nearly 20 per cent
less than last year, but there was no further de
cline in pr.ccs. No important change appears in
the leatner market and | hides are somewhat weak
er Prices of wool have declined an average of 2.4
per cent within the month of February, presuma
bly because of the failure of the oroposed tariff bill
which included duties on wool. At present the
sales are the smallest recorded for years. There is
no improvement- whatever In the demand for
woolen goods, and a number of establishments
have closed or reduced working forces.
Some further reductions . have been made in
prices of cotton goods, although it does | not appear
that the concessions have thus far been unsaccoiis
fnl in calline out new business. - Reports are fre
quent that many of the largest mills are about to
stop production for a time In order to give the mar
ket opportunity to clew itself. :.;,
- Speculation in breadstuff* has not been particu
larly active nor has a change in . prices been im
portant. Western receiuts of wheat were 2.301,000
bMshels acainst 1,824,000 for the same week last
year. Atlantic export* , again fell behind those of
last year, amounting for the week to 1.541,000
bushels, tlo-.ir included, against 1,886,1)00 last
year. - -*â¢ I ** m *^ a 'iP Ã ' a ' m P+ i * m * a:! ftr^toij*wtisfi m tVL
â  With continuing large receipts, corn remains
substantially unchanged in price. The cotton mar
ket has continued Its downward movement, spots
having fallen 3-16 again, and the May â  option ;20
points. Receipts continue as before, so large as to
render quite inadmissible he lowest estimate of
the crop of 1895. and at the same time ' the prepa
rations for planting this year go on at such a* scale I
that It 1* believed by many conservative observers
that the crop with favorable weather may prove
one of the largest on record. Â« ,-.â â â

Landing, Mission 1, ricr a.Interesting Report of Important Up-to-Date News Items in Alameda County
HAS COME BACK
FROM THE GRAVE
Evangelist Smith Did Not
Die in the Poor
house.
IS AGAIN AT WORK.
The Young Convert He Married
Said to Be Wedded
Again.
HIS FORTUNE WAS A MYTH.
A Record of Crime and Hypocrisy
That Was Carried on Around
the Bay.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 6. \
Evangelists and members and officers of
the Young Men's Christian Association on
both sides of the bay are greatly surprised
at the resurrection of James Alexander
Smith of Eiigland. Mr. Smith, whose his
tory has never yet been told and probably
never will be told completely, was sup
posed to have died at the Alameda County
poorbouse about a year ago under another
riame. It was stated at the time that the
dead man's identity had been made posi
tive and many people breathed more
freely.
Rev. J. A. Smith has had a more varied
experience than falls to the lot of most ad
venturers who select the Pacific Coast as
their field of operations. About four years
ago he appeared in San Francisco as an
evangelist and held a series of very suc
cessful meetings. There were many con
versions and the evangelist made many
friends.
After a few weeks Mr. Smith began to
hint at a fortune that was in litigation in
Kn^-land and that might soon be distrib
uted. On the strength of his representa
tions the evangelist did considerable "rais
ing." All this time he was boarding at
the establishment of an English lady on
Fourth street, neat Howard, in San Fran
cisco. Board bills were not presented, as
the evangelist was so thoroughly religious
and had expectations.
Among his converts, while conducting
his services at the church of Rev. Frank
lin Rboda in South San Francisco, was an
estimable young woman named Miss Hat
tie Lawrence. After her conversion Rev.
Mr. Smith paid particular attention to
Miss Lawrence, and eventually announced
that they were engaged. Smith was over
*'*) years of age at that time and his fiancee
was not half that number of years, but she
was a sensible woman, and so long as the
evangelist had a fortune in prospect it was
tnought the match was not a very unto
ward affair.
Alter bis marriage Sfcnith commenced to
plunge. His future was assured and be
couid af%4d to do "the right thing" by his
bridle, so he took her on a weddins trip to
Santa Cruz County. He bought her a pair i
of tine horses, and also purchased a ranch, j
He paid for them both with expectations |
and did the same with his hotel bills. |
After he had spent a few weeks in this :
manner he reappeared in San Francisco at {
his Fourth-street boarding-house.
Oce day he received an important letter
from England- The estate had been dis
tributed, and his Ehare of $.50,000 was be
ing brought to him by an English lawyer. ;
liilis accumulated rapidJy, and the young
Mrs. Smith was in raptures at the pros- j
)Â«ect cf seeing some actual coin at last.
The time came for the arrival of the law- !
yer and the $50,00(3. A sumptuous repast i
\vas prepared and Rev. J. A. Smith went
to the ferry to receive his important guest,
leaving his wife and the iandlady to put
tbe finishing touches on the feast.
The evangelist did not return. A week
later he was found in British Columbia.
A warrant from Santa Cruz found him.
Mr, Smith had used the name of the sec
retary of the Y. M. C. A. at that city to
supply current cash. Secretary McCoy of
San Francisco also had a grievance against
Smith. The evangelist was taken to Santa
Cruz and was sent to Folsom. His.young
wife went to live at Berkeley and severed
the bonds of matrimony, and it is said she
has married again. After regaining his
freedom Smith was heard from in Sacra
mento, where he met with some trouble,
and after that stories were published that
he had died under an assumed name in
i he poorhouse.
For the past few days he has been in this
city, and is again taking a hand in evan
gelical work.
EXEMPT FIREMK.V WIN.
The City Council Must Set Aside the
Needed Money.
OAKLAND, Cai,., March 6.â The man
damus proceedings against the City Coun
cil by Attorney de Golia on behalf of
George Taylor have virtually been de
cided against the city, as Judge Frick to
day notified the attorney to prepare and
submit findings. This is a victory for the
Exempt Firemen, who were making an ef
fort to compel the City Council to set aside
a sufficient sum from the general funds of
the city to pay any or all warrants drawn
in their favor in accordance with the terras
of the statute.
The firemen organized recently by elect
ing a board of directors consisting of
Henry Evers, J. M. Bassett, M. de La
Montanya, Peter Baker and D. S. Hirsh
berg. These organized by choosing Bas
t-ett president and Hirshberg secretary.
A warrant was drawn for G. Taylor in the
sum of ?J0 and presented to the Council,
where it was rejected. Mandamus pro
ceedings were instituted and this is the re
sult. .
WANT THE TOOLS.
Contest for the Boy Burglars' Outfit Be
ing Waged.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 6.â Now that
the cases against Bert Wi I more and Abe
Majors have been disposed of there is a
pretty contest going on for possession of
the pistols and burglar's outfit which were
taken from them when arrested. There
are no legs than three claimants for the
stuff. On February 10 the boys gave an
assignment for everything to Ned Ayer,
the hrst attorney in the case, who, in re
turn, vras to conduct their preliminary ex
amination.
Ayer withdrew from the case later on
account of a difference over finances and
assigned' his claim to Attorney F. B.
Josephs. Attorney O'Brien defended Mrs.
Wilrnore, and she secured an order from
Bert and gave it to him. Archie Majors
secured ao order from Abe for the goods
also. Chief Lloyd has refused to honor
any of the orders until an amicable agree
ment between all parties is reached. So
far this has 1 not been possible.
The money which was recovered from
the Wilmore house, amounting to some
thing, over $100, will be returned to the
parties from whom stolen pro rata, ex
cept when ownership can be proved. I his
;atter was the case with a roll of money
which was stolen frow Miller <fc Butler s
safe. This was still intact when recovered
and was turned over to the firm by Chief
Lloyd. The other losers are making affi
davits as to the amounts they lost. The
stolen watches and jewelry were returned.

James N'ewhard Draws a Pension, but '
Fails to Provide.
OAKLAND, Cal., March G.â Mrs. Nellie
Newhard has instituted suit for divorce
from her husband, James M. Newhard, on
the ground of failure to provide. They
have been married since November, 1868,
and have three children, James, age 18;
Daisy, age 17, and Maurice, ace 10. She
alleges the husband and father receives
$75 quarterly as pension. She says in her
complaint that Newhard has deserted her I
and the family without cause and refuses
to provide for their support. Since he left j
them they have been compelled to rely i
upon the charity of friends to keep them
from starving.
She says that Newhard spends large
sums of "money for intoxicating liqi*>rs
and for morphine, and unless restrained
by the court will quickly dispose of what
he now has on hnnd. She asks that he b e
ordered to pay her $35 a month for support
of the family, and be restrained from dis
posing of the meney received from the
Government. She also asks to be allowed
$50 attorney's fees.
DRIVEN TO THE WALL.
The Fortin Company Goes Into Volun
tary Insolvency.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 6.â The efforts
of the Fortin Brick Company to avoid the
sacrifice of its property by insolvency pro
ceedings, which have been in progress sev
eral weeks, have proved unsuccessful.
This afternoon their attorney tiled a peti
tion for voluntary insolvency. The re
sources are estimated at about $130,000,
and the liabilities at $84,000, including
$40.6C0 secured.
Henry Cowell's attachment is the cause
!of this move. The others had all been
i withdrawn and Astie's claim was knocked
out yesterday in the Marin County Supe
rior Court. The action of the creditor in
forcing the firm into insolvency is re
gretted here, where they have always been
known for honorable dealings.

numbered among those who will follow
Ballington Booth. This news was brought
up from the islands by Mrs. Adjutant
Egner, who arrived yesterday and is now
staying with Sergeant-Major and Mrs.
Brown at their residence on Madison
street.
Nearly two years ago Adjutant EgneT
went to Honolulu to establish the Salva
tion Army in the republic. The methods
of the Salvationists were so well suited to
the inclinations of the Hawaiians that
the movement has been a success from the
beginning. There are now three lively
corps in the islands and more are contem
plated. One of these is in Honolulu, an
other in Hilo and a third in "Wailuka.
Adjutant Eener commands the island
forces from Honolulu. The Hilo corps is
in charpe of Captain Miss Zimmers, a
native daughter of California. Lieuten
ant Mis? Jeffers of San Diego is the adju
tant's assisting officer at Honolulu and
Captain Langridge and Lieutenant Sharp
less are in charge of Wailuka.
The project of establishing a corps on
the leper island of Molokai has been taken
under consideration, but no definite steps
have yet been determined upon.
A Salvation Army corps in Hawaii is
one of the most cosmopolitan sights on
the islands. Sometimes "a dozen nation*
alities are represented. For this reason it
will soon be necessary to issue an edition
of the War Cry in the native tongue.
Wailuka, in the island of Maui, is the
: baby corps, and scarcely any but natives
! attend the meetings. One of the most
steauy supporters of the army is a saloon
i keeper, and the only time he loses his
| temper is when his War Cry is not deliv
j ered regularly. What makes it more in
! teresting is the fact that the uniformed
1 soldier who carries the paper to the saloon
j used to be one of its best customers.
Several outposts are maintained on the 1
' islands, and in going to and fro the officers !
\ frequently meet with exciting experiences.
Captain Langridge and Lieutenant Sharp
â  less were crossing a mountain stream in
â¢ their horse and cart, when the occupants
I were thrown out and landed in the bottom
;of the stream. Neither was seriously
j hurt, but they lost some of their property.
Shortly before Mrs. Egner left the rains
set in, and as the meetings in Honolulu
were held in a big tent considerable diffi-
I culty was - experienced. The army is
j trying to secure a permanent hold in Hon
olulu, but so far has not been able to do so.
"I am somewhat surprised at the action
of Balhngton Booth," said Mrs. Egner,
I "but I do not think the %rmy at large will
I suffer. The officers in the islands are all
j loyal to the army and I am sure that
! anything Ballington Booth may do will
! not affect them. Everything is prosper-
I ing down there and the future is very
; bright."
Two years of hard work has completely
I undermined Mrs. Egner's health. She is
j now in a very serious condition, bordering
;on nervous prostration. Her doctors
i ordered her immediate return to this coun-
I try, as the climate of the islands is not
' suited for her health. Although Mrs.
j Egner reports great progress by the Sal
! vation Army in Hawaii her many little
references to hardships prove that the lot
of a Salvation Army officer is much the
same the world over.
GREENBACKS FOR CENTS.
Two Boys Purloin a Letter and
Sell $30 Worth of Bills
for a Song.
They May Be Handed Over to the U.
S. Postal Authoritiesâ Petition to
the Library Trustees.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 6.â Milton
Blaie, the youngster who was caught
some time ago trying to dispose of a gold
watch which he had purloined and was sub
sequently discharged, is attain entangled in
the meshes of the law. This time it will
probably be the postal authorities who
will deal with his case, for he is charged
with the serious offense of tampering with
the United States mails. At any rate,
Secret Agent Harris has been notified of
Blake's latest escapade.
Yesterday young Blake wandered over
to East Oakland with a lot of handbills
which he was distributing for a local
shoemaker. In his wanderings he chanced
to strike up an acquaintance with another
boy, and together they made a tour of the
streets. Arriving in front of the residence
at 1180 East Sixteenth street they entered
the yard of the place, as they had others,
and one of them, Blake, mounted" the
steps. In doing so he espied under the
door a letter winch had been deposited
some few minutes earlier.
Blake could not resist the temptation to
extract the letter and appropriate it to
himself. Joining his companion on the
street, the two made off, and after going to
a convenient spot thej' opened the stolen
parcel. In it they found a $10 and a $20
greenback.
The boys continued about the streets
and made several attempts to dispose of
the paper, but without success until they
came to the real estate office of White
Brothers at 1123 Twenty-third street, where
Milton Blaka offered his bill for sale to
Charles A. White. He was willing to take
10 cents for the $20 bill which he held, but
this offer aroused the suspicion of White,
and he came to the conclusion that it was
either bogus or stolen, though he kept his
opinion to himself. Milton's companion
all this time was standing at the corner.
Mr. White sought him and discovered that
he aiso had a bill which he was willing to
dispose of for the nominal Bum of 10 cents,
which was given him.
Then the boys were allowed to go, and the
purchaser of the two greenbacks awaited
developments. This morning he drove
through Alameda on business intent, and
soon after leaving Park street and getting
a little distance down Santa Clara avenue
ran across one of the boys whom he recog
nized as the boy Milton Blake. Mr. White
hastened to the police station and inform
ing Officer Conrad of his desire to catch
the boy both hastened down the avenue to
head him off. They captured him near
Walnut street. The trio returned to the
police station and listened to the young
thiot's story. He admitted the theft of
the letter, and declared that he had thrown
it away. Blake was accompanied to East
Oakland by Chief Koeers and Officer Con
rad and also to the place where the
letter was stolen, which was at the plaoe
mentioned above.
After getting all the testimony and as
certaining the identity and also what con
nection the other boy had with the matter
the poiice have nothing now to do but
hand the prisoner over to the United
States authorities, because the case does
not come under their jurisdiction.
lor German Literature.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 6. â Some
months a^o a petition was presented to
the Library Trustees, signed by the Ger
man born and speaking citizens, asking
that books in their native language ba
placed on the shelves. Rev. H. E. J.
Ongerth of the German Evangelical Church
was one of the prime movers in this mat
ter, and as teacher of German in the High
School was appointed a committee to sug
gest a list of desirable books to be placed
in the library. Most of the books have
already been shelved. They were bought
from F. W. Barkhaus, the San Francisco
bookseller, and cost the city *7fl 90, and in
clude seventeen volumes of Meyer's "Con
versations Lexicon," thirty-six volumes
of Gnethe, fifteen of Schiller, Lessing's
works, Weber's "Weltgeschichte" in two
volumes, Sherer's "Deutscher Dichter

WALLER MttST PAY.
Damages Given Against Him for an
Assault on an Kxprens
uiun.
Damages in the extent of $150 were as
sessed against Gu3 Waller, the Olympic
Club heavy-weight boxer, by a jury in
| Justice Carroll's court yesterday in conse
! quence of the defendant's prowess with his
lists. John Robinson, an expressman,
found a tiny pug dog standing in the nud
j die of Grant avenue one tlay, and taking
i compassion on the little beast carried it
j home and cared for it for some time.
Finally he saw an advertisement in The
! Call canine attention to the loss of a dog
answering to the description of the one in
his possession and offering a reward for its
return. He sent the dog by an employe,
but got no reward and called himself to
ascertain why. He was received with blows
j and kicks, which he claims caused him
pain and humiliation to the extent of $299,
and sued for that amount.
The jury demanded by Waller was evi
dently impressed with Robinson's story,
for it gave him damages in the amount
mentioned.

Late Duchess.
IS A PROMINENT ATHLETE.
Co-Eds Practice Basket-Ball in Pre
paration for a Tussle With
Stanford University.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 6.â Millions
of money and a royal German title are in
waiting for Charles Louis Oldenbourg, a
member of the senior class in the college
of mines at the University of California.
Word was received in Berkeley last week
of the death in Germany of Elizabeth,
Duchess of Oldenbourg, and to-day infor
mation reached Berkeley that all her vast
riches and the title of Duke would be be
stowed on the young man at the univer
sity at the depth of her husband, the
present Duke. The present Dune of Olden
bourg ia the only living brother of the
Berkeley student's father, and as the
Duchess died without issue, young
Charles, according to her wish, will fall
heir to the title and estate of his uncle.
The estate consists of valuable mining
and agricultural interests in what was once
the independent principality of Olden
bourg, but which has now coalesced with
the other states, and is valued *at from
$3,000,000 to $5,000,000. The first token of
remembrance which the prospective heir
has received from his aunt, the now de
ceased duchess, reached him at Berkeley
to-day. It was a heavy diamond ring,
several hundred years old, and an heirloom
of the house of Oldenbourg. He is also in
receipt of papers through his father, who
is now m Colima, Mexico, which will neces
sitate his quick return to Germany, in
order that the necessary form may be ob
served before becoming heir-apparent to
the title and the legacy. As Oldenbourg's
father was the second son in the family he
never expected to receive anything more
than a small portion of the estate, but
since the death of his brother's wife mat
ters have taken a decidedly different
aspect.
The title which the young Berkeley
student expects to receive is Charles Louis
Duke of Oldenbourg. The prospect of
coming into possession of such a vast storo
of wealth and the acquirement of so much
influence has made no apparent difference
upon the young collegian, as he is going
about his university work with his usual
modesty and good humor. It was his in
tention upon graduation from college to
go to Mexico and assist his father in the
mining business, but the recent news
from "Germany has materiallychanged his
plans.
Oldenbourg is a member of the local
C. L. Oldenbourg.
chapter of the Kappa Alpha Fraternity,
and during his first two years at college
was prominent in athletic circles.
In his freshman year he was a sprinter
of no mean ability, as well as being a
skillful player on the gridiron. During a
portion of last year he played end on the
Olympic Club team in some of their con
tests with the Butte eleven. He states
that he will leave for Mexico in a few
weeks, where he will join his lather, who
will accompany him back to Germany for
the purpose of arranging the details con
nected with his prospective vast wealth.
Athletic Trip East.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 6.â Captain
Merwin of the University of California
track athletic team nas been informed that
the University of Chicago Athletic Associ
ation will not guarantee the $300 asKed ior
by the California athletes before attempt
ing another trip. With reference to this
report Captain Merwin said to-day: "It
does not matter much whether Chicago
comes into the ring or not. We can
easily defeat them in a contest, and aside
from the $300 toward making our trip a
possibility there would be but little in a
meet with them. We have written to
several other colleges in the Middle West
asking if they can make us guarantees,
and if we receive information that $1800 in
all can be assured us I think there is no
question but wnat we will go East.
"Though we will not have the team that
we had last year, we can still do the uni
versity and the State credit, I believe.
The loss of Barnes and Scoggins has af
fected our team materially, so far as the
sprints are concerned, but we can make
up for that deficiency in the weights, hur
dles and distance races."
As to the spring contest with Stanford,
Captain Merwin said: "l understand that
our friends down the bay are training
very hard this season and that they are
Bhowing up very well. We feel very cer
tain, however, that we will maintain at
least during the corning year our place as
coast champions in track and field ath
letics, but not by so large a margin as last
year, I fear.
"The freshmen-sophomore field day to
be held on Saturday, the 14th, may de
velop some sprinters and middle distance
men who will pat us en our feet, so far as
the track is concerned. We are stronger
than ever in the weights and our jumpers
are not to be lightly considered."
Captain Merwin seemed to have full as
surance that if the money could be raised
another trip, at least as far as Chicago to
compete in the West era intercollegiate
meeting, would be made during the pres
"ent spring.
Co-Ed Basket-Ball Plnyerg.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 6. â The
Berkeley co-eds held their first basket
ball practice game in the gymnasium to
day in preparation for their prospective

has been written to the Stanford team by
Manager Brownsill of the Berkeley nine
accepting the challenge. of the former to a
game to be played within one month, with
the condition that the contest take place
indoors and not before a mixed audience.
One of the terms of the challenge was that
the contest should take place on the Stan
ford campus. This condition" the Berkeley
gins will not listen to, and accordingly in
their acceptance stated that they would
play indoors only.
It is believed that the championship
game can be arranged without difficulty,
since the place of playing seems to be the
only point of difference "between the two
teams.
Meanwhile the Berkeley players will
continue daily practice in preparation for
the coming contest. There is much ex
citement amoni; them, as this will be the
first intercollegiate game they have ever
had an opportunity to participate in.
Most prominent among the Berkeley
players are: Miss Griswald, '98, captain;
Misses Grace, Jones, Terrill, McCleave,
Brownsill, Farnhani, Robinson. and
Knight. Miss Brownsill was elected
manager for the present season yesterday.
The captain states that she has no fear
but what ncr eirls will' be in condition to
meet the wearers of the cardinal when the
time comes.

BERKELEY, Cal., March 6.â The Den
tal College is arranging for a field day, to
be held on the university cinder track

new one in the history of the University
of California, the affiliated colleges not
having taken part in athletic events to
such an extent at any time hitherto.

lines of athletics and in consequence it is
hoped that a number of good men will be
added to the Varsity team as a result of
the present activity of the affiliated college
men.

win that the law, medical and dental
colleges hold a series of field days for the
purpose of determining their respective
standing on track and fieJd.

be the fastest man in the 100-yard event
now in the university. He holds a record
of 10 1-5 seconds.

SUTRO BATHS OPENING.
The Big Building Was Illumin
ated and Tested Last
Night.
Colonel T. P. Robinson Tells of the
Round of Amusements to Be
Provided.
The Sutro Baths were illuminated for
the iirst time and tested in every way last
night by the Mayor and his managers. A
small party of friends was present and en
joyed the imposing sight of the vast build
ing brilliant. with a flood of electric light
and the comfortable sensation of being in
a temperature many degrees higher than
the normal air outside. The most promi
nent figure was Colenel T. P. Robinson,
the manager of Sutro's amusements.
"What do you think of the sight?" he
asked, as he waved his hand toward the
galleries and the swimming tanks.
"We are not finished yet with the elec
tric lights, for we shall put in more until
there are fifty-eight arc lamps and 1600 in
candescent lights in the building."
It was, however, a splendid electrical
display, with rows of arc lamps suspended
from the roofs, and the wails and promi
nent outlines dotted with incandescent
glows.
The water in the tanks was heated for a
trial of the heating apuaratus. In the large
tank the temperature was between 78 and
Bt> degress. The lowest temperature in
the whole building was over the cold
fresh-water tank, where it stood at 62. The
circulating gates were opened and closed,
and the water in the tanks was found to
meve continuously. Everything was de
clared in readiness for the grand opening
on March 14.
The progranyne for this notabie event
will begin at Tp. m. with the opening cere
monies. At 3 p. m. the tanks will be
thrown open to bathers and Cassasa's
band will discourse music ail the after
noon. By that date a band stand will
have been erected in the middle of the
building over the first small tank from the
entrance. In the evening the Olympics
will give an exhibition of an aquatic and
athletic nature in the building.
"There will be double bathrooms ready
for 680 people," continued the colonel,
"clubrooms lor 1350, and the seating'capa
city will be 8000. Besides we will have
2000 chairs on the lower and upper prome
nade, and there will be still further room
in the halls and the big restaurant. Our
concessions in the baths will be attractive
features.- Tne main one will be the restau
rant conducted on the Louvre plan on
three floors, where people can have meals
or lunches at City prices and enjoy the
concerts.
"There will be no bar in the building, as
all the liquors will be sold only at tables.
Tne other concessions will be a stereo
scopic panorama, an ice cream and candy
stand, tiie Edison parlor with phono
graphs, kinetoscopes, etc., and a cigar
stand. Sutro's museum and -art gallery
can be enjoyed by visitors free of charge.
We have contracted with Cassasa to give
concerts every evening and matinee con
certs Sundays and Saturdays also. We
are making arrangements to give operas
such as 'Pinafore' Sunday and Saturday
afternoons on a ship in the water, and ex
pect to have the'Tivoli company present
the operas.
"Outside the building most of the attrac
tions will be open on March 14. They will
be on Merry street, a 'midway' sixty feet
wide, for pedestrians only.
"The Fifth wheel, mystic maze, haunted
swing and a two-story hobby-horse, as
used in Paris, will be ready for visitors.
As soon as possible thereafter the camera
obscura, the Venetian canal and a me
nagerie will be opened. The canal will be
something like the scenic railway at the
Midwinter Fair, Only it will be a canal
with boats which rush down the declines
and give a sail of 1600 feet. There will be
camels, donkeys and goats for children to
ride. Then, when all these are in opera
tion, Mr. Sutro will build a large amphi
theater for fete days and a target range for
the rifle companies and National Guard.
The general plan is to offer permanent en
tertainment, the like of which was nevei
before thought of in San Francisco."

DENISON MAY
NOT GET THERE.
Ex-Mayor Pardee a Strong
Candidate for Delegate
to St. Louis.
BOTH WANT PRIMARIES.
No Reliance to Be Placed in the
. Alameda County Com
mittee.
STRENGTH IS ABOUT EQUAL
Great Interest in ToÂ« Day's Meeting
of the Third Congressional
District Committee.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 5. )
Senator Eli Denison, who has been so
successful in his former political fights
that he 4s known all over the State as "Get
there Eli," is not to have a walkover in
the struggle for Xational delegate to the
Republican Convention. Â£x-Mayor George
C. Pardee has announced himself as a can
didate for the honor, and no two candi
dates could be found who are more thor
oughly representative of the two great
factions that divide politics in this county.
Senator Denison is a stanch adherent of
the old Republican guard ; Dr. Pardee is
the head of the reform and anti-railroad
forces, and each man can depend upon the
solid backing of his faction.
The matter will probably be decided at
the polls, as both men are in favor of open
primaries. The question whether or not
primaries will be held or delegates named
by State Central Cornmitteemen from this
county will be decided to-morrow at the
meeting of the Third District Congres
sional Committee that meets at Senator
Earl's office in San Francisco.
Senator Denison's friends refer to the
fact that he has already been sent from
this district to three National Republican
conventions, and argue that he should jÂ»o
again on account of his experience. Dr.
Pardee's friends say that the Senator has
had more than his share of the honor at
taching to the mission, and use this as the
basis of an argument for their candidate.
The Third District has only two dele
gates to choose, and but one of them is
likely to come from Alameda County, so
it is "not possible that both Senator Deni
son and Dr. Pardee will go to the St. Louis
convention. The Alameda County mem
bers of the State Central Committee could
decide if they should assume the respon
sibility of naming delegates to the State
Convention, or at least they could relegate
the power to the County Committee.
Should the matter be left to the County
Committee, it is a foregone conclusion that
Dr. Pardee would be named. The Deni
son faction in the County Committee has
the chairman and possibly rive others out
of thirteen. The only reason that Chair
man Mautalen has not been deposed is
because his friends have succeeded in pre
venting the assembling of a quorum.
Should the same tactics be pursued in the
future it would be useless to leave the
matter to the County Committee, as no
meeting would ever be held unless it were
known that the result would be favorable
to the minority. Consequently it is prob
able that primaries will be ordered, es
pecially as Committeeman Morrow has
already announced that he is favorable to
that plan.
. In any event it will be an interesting po
litical struggle. Dr. Pardee is young,
vigorous and aggressive. Senator Denison
is experienced, shrewd and a tighter from
the start. Dr. Pardee has not once lost a
political battle in which he has entered
with energy and Senator Denison has "got
there" on "practically every occasion. Each
has his strongholds. Dr. Pardee has the
large Seventh Ward solid for him and a
fair following in the Second and Fifth.
Senator Denison owns the Fourth, First
and Sixth politically, and the balance of
power between the two candidates is very
evenly distributed. If a primary is ordered
nearly two months will be given in which
to prepare for it, and the preliminary work
of both sides will be very thorough.

ing one long, zig-zag shaped table.
Exquisite white damask covered the
board, down the entire length of which

filled with the pale lavender brodea,
mingled with leathery wild oats and alter
nating with bowls of golden eschssholtzias

pointed table. Needless to say the menu
was rii elaborate and delicious one.

Rewired, That we, the teachers of the Pen
man School, deeply mourn the loss of our dear
friend and associate, Miss Almira T. Flint, who
lias been called by our Great Master from her
life work in this school to enjoy the eternal
reward of tne good and the just.
Her life, for more than v quarter of a century,
among the young ladies of the Denman School,
has always been devoted to elevating the high
standing of this school, in which she herself
received her first instruction.
Her devotion to duty and to the moral and
intellectual welfare of the pupils under her
care will ever make her memory blessed to her
pupils and to her associate teachers.
To her sorrowing mother we offer our ten
derest sympathy in this hour of her bereave
ment, trusting that she may find comfort and
consolation in the knowledge that her dear
departed has left a name which will ever be
honored by all with whom she has been asso
ciated.

THE PATHETIC LETTERS
Diana Pacheco and Edward Hack,
Eighteen and Twenty
Years.
ONE PISTOL AND TWO BULLETS.
Circumstances Prevented Their Mar
riageâMrs. Jessie Larue Un
pleasantly Mentioned.
Oakland Office San* Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, March 6. f
Diana Pacheco, a eirl about IN years
of age, and Edward Hack, a youth of 20,
yielded up their lives, either last night or
early this morning, because they would
not be separated.
Miss Pacheco is a member of a family re
siding at Concord. Contra Costa County.
She has been i:i Oakland some months
and was an intimate acquaintance of Mrs.
Jeasie Larue. Mrs. Larue obtained some
degree of notoriety last summer by follow
ing up her husband on her bicycle. She
found him keeping an appointment with
another woman, and produced a little cow
hide and a scene on Broadway at the same
time.
There were divorce proceedings after
ward and counter charges of secret moon
light bicycle rides, but eventually Mrs.
Larue got the divorce and the baby re
ferred to in the letters written by the
young couple now dead. After her divorce
Mrs. Larue was employed as a waitress in
the St. Paul restaurant on Eighth street.
Her companion was Miss Pacheco, who
was also a waitress. Mrs. Lame's hus
band was always on the lookout for some
thing that could lay the foundation for his
obtaining the custody of the child, and
evidently Mrs. Larue suspected Diana was
telling Mr. Larue things that his divorced
wife did not want him to know. From
the letters it is clearly inferred that Mrs.
Larue wrote to the father of Diana's sweet
heart and told him his son was keeping
company with a young woman unworthy
of him.
Young Edward Hack, who was a barber
employed at the Fashion Parlors, was told
by his father ci ail that had been said and
lie repeated it to tiie young lady, to whom
he was passionately attached.
Then the tragedy was decided upon. Ed
was to kill Diana and then turn the pistol
on himseJf. How faithfully the plan was
carried out was made known to-night.
About a week ago Miss Pacheco rented a
room at 511 Fifth street. Last Monday
evening Hack cam c and the two have been
in each others company ever since. Last
night they weMt together to the girl's
room about 7 o' clock.
About 11 o'clock Hack went out fora
few minute* and returned, and after that
ootttSng was seen of the couple till they
were discovered side by side to-night with
s bullet in each heart.
W. A. Dannakei, the landlord of the
house, said he was suspicious that all was
not right to-night, so he decided to break
in tne door.
'â I had not seen them ail day," he said,
"and when the door was tried it was found
to be locked. I waited till about 8 o'clock
and then I broke it in and found them
both dead."
When the Coroner entered the room half
an hour later the tragedy was seen at a
glance. Hack was dressed with tlie excep
tion of his coat and boots. The girl had
also only taken off her waist and boots.
Both were lying straight on the bed, their
bodies cold and almost rigid, showing that
death had taken place many hours before.
Hack was on the left, with his left arm
under tne girl's he;>.d and her left hand was
raised so as to grasp his ringers. His right
arm was under his head, and the attitude
of the two was one of perfect repose. Over
the heart of the girl was a large hole in
her clothing, with powder bums around,
showing that the shot had been hred while
the barrel of the pistol was pressed upon
her oreast. Over ttie heart of young Hack
and on his shirt, which was exposed by
his open vest, was a similar hole, showing
where the second bullet had found a rest
ing-place. Hack's right arm lay across
his breast, just as. it had fallen when he
pulled the trigger the second time. Be
tween them, as it had fallen from his
hand, was tde pistol.
On the bureau was a pen and a bottle of
ink. In an envelope addressed to his
father was a long letter that tells its own
sad Btory. On several envelopes was a
letter from the girl. As there was only
one pen each must have written sepa
rately. There were several corrections
and interlineations, but the same spirit is
shown in both of them. It must have
taken at least two hours to do the writing,
and what the thoughts of each must have
been as they watched the other penning
their dying message can easily be learned
from the letters themselves.
There was evidently more than a touch
of sentiraentalism in the nature of the girl,
for in the middle of one of her paragraphs
she drew an outline of two hearts. An ar
row was pictured as having pierced them

both and underneath was the inscription,
"Our broken hearts."
Although there were several lodgers in
adjoining rooms no one can be found who
heard the shots. From this it is considered
probable that the murder and suicide did
not take place till after the lodgers were
asleep or until they had left their rooms
early this morning.
Mrs. Larue, who is blamed so bitterly
by Diana in her letter as being at the bot
tom of all their unhappiness, is at present
in Sacramento. Judging from the letters,
she has become acquainted with Hack's
father and had influenced him against the
girl, as Edward refers to being disowned
if he does not give her up.
At the morgue the Coroner's deputy
arranged the bodies and the pistol exactly
as they had been found in the room. One
glance at the two unhappy children, for
they appeared to be very youthful, is all
the evidence any juryman would need.
Diana Pacheco is of pure Spanish descent.
She has a petite figure, dark, eyes, and a
mass of dark hair that hangs far below
her shoulders. She was rather pretty, but
very cheaply dressed.
Edward Hack also has some Spanish
blood in his veins, and has dark features
and thick black hair. He was evidently a
bright young fellow, with a physique very
little larger than that of a pirl. As they
lay side by side they had the appearance
almost of having been brother and sister.
The restaurant in which Diana Pacheco
and Mrs. Larue were waitresses dispensed
with some of their help a few weeks ago,
among them Diana, and it is not known
where the murdered girl has been since
then until last Monday. Diana was, like
Mrs. Larue, an ardent lover of the bicycle,
and was a familiar figure on the streets of
Oakland. Mrs. Larue's husband was also
a barber, and it is said that he and young
Hack both worked in the same shop. The
letter left by Diana Pacheco is as follows:
Dtar Papa and Mamma: I suppose you have
already forgotten me, as you have not an
swered my letter that I wrote to you about two
weeks ago. Dear mamma and papa, you must
forgive me for doing such a crime, as my lov
ing Ed and 1 said we would end our lives be
fore we would separate; so we have. Do not
blame my darling Ed, for he said if he could
not have me he would end his life, as his,
father could not have him to marry me, as he
is under age. There is only one in this wide
world that I am against and her name is Mrs.
Jessie Larue, the Oakland champion bicycle
rider, as they call her. She has told many lies
to Ed's father and he of course believed her.
She may swear to them, but she is a liar. How
I hate to use that word on any one, but I must
call her. Bat God forgive her, as I couldn't
have such a weak heart as hers. She lives in
Sacramento now. It has broke us two all up of
what she has said, but now a 9 we are gone she
may say everything she pleaies. But I do not
believe her, as she is a liar.
Mamma dear, kiss papa, brothers and sisters
and your dear self for me, and remember me to
Mrs. D. Dal ton and lamily. You may love my
dear Ed * you love me, as he is the only man
in this wide world for me besides you all. Wish
ing everybody a happy welfare.it is our last
wish to be buried in the same place, side by
side, plain as possible. E. 11. and D. P. "Our
true hearts.
(Here is roughly drawn a picture of two
hearts pierced with one arrow.)
1 begged my darling Ed to shoot me before
himself. Bury us side by side, as plain as
possible. Please do not let the doctors mangle
with our bodies. I begged my darling to shoot
me. J>o not let doctors mangle our bodies.
Let our bodies be buried as we are. It is our
wisti to be buried together.
Forgive us; bury us in the same place, side
by side. lie said he would end his life before
he would leave me. You cannot imagine how
ray darling Ed loved me, and we could not stay
away from each other. Darling papa and
mamma, we went across the bay and had a
good time. Please forgive us, and do not blame
it onto us, as we lovtd each other and we had
to do it, so there is no murder in the ending ol
our lives. God bless my dt^ar little Kosie.
Your true and unfortunate daughter,
Diana PACSSOO.
The following letter written by Hack
was found on the bureau:
Oakland, March 3.
My Dear Fathfr: I disobeyed you by coming
down here against your will, but I could not
rest till you would be willing to have me come
to her I love. I came as my love was stronger
than my truthtulness. Mrs. Larue has lied
what she has said about my darling. She is no
good herself , and likes to drag others down
equal to herself. Diana tells me that Mrs. La
me and her mother and Mr. Peters, her
brother-in-law, think I have been spying on
Mrs. Larue (.lessie), but I only called thtre to
favor Kd (her husband) to see their baby, as he
was anxious to know if it was kept well. My
dear fatiier, I am sorry you believe so bad of
my sweetheart, who I know loves me more
than life, no matter what she may have done
in the past. 1 know she would do what is right
and be a faithful wife to me, when I should be
come old enough to marry. You say I must
give her up. I NEVER WILL, and as you will
disown me, my true darling and I will fly to
gether from this cruel, heartless world.
Diana forgives you for the way you have
misjudged her. She is not the bad girl you
think her. This self-murder seems to be a
very toolish and wicked thing to do, but if you
only Knew how we have both suffered you
could not think us so mad and foolhardy. You
know what you said to me, dear father, and I
told you I'd rather die than give her up. You
do not know me, father, although I am your
son. If you knew how my poor darling has stif
ered you would RKLE.VT. It is TOO LATE now.
Diana gave me her oath on her knees, and I
believe her before any one else. She begged
me to kill her rather than quit her. and so I
have. Let Diana's {plks know that she begs
their forgiveness and dies happy in my love.
My dear loving father, this is a very cruel
way to treat you, but forgive me and do not
injure yourself, do not kill yourself or do any
thing rash. I know how you feel, but this is
my last and only wish. For tne love you bear
me do not worry over me, for the dead are bet
ter off tnan the living. Father, if you love me
do not harm yourself. You have Deen a good
father to me, too good, in fact. Let me be
buried plain and cheap, side by side, or cre
mated, and our ashes put together. I am per
fectly cool and in my sober senses.
If I'm crazy 1 do not know it. Mrs. Larue
bates me. She thinks I hare been telling on
her to Ed, her husband. I like Ed; he is a good
fellow, and I am sorry for him in having such
a devil for a wife. She does this to get even on
me. God bless the little lady. I will not say
any more, as you understand my feelings. I
bid all of my friends good-by, and Diana the
same to hers. My darling and I would rather
fly to the ills we know not of then live a life
that would be a hell. Gooa-by, father. Your
loving son, Ed Hack.
The name Diana Pacheco was also put
to the letter.
On Hack was found a conductor's check
for ferry passage. It had on its face:
"Notice on other side."
On the back was written in pencil:
"I have with me $5 75, a Colt's revolver,
a diamond stud, a watch, knife; rings on
girl's ringer. Give them to my father."
The envelope was addressed :
"Mr. Henry L. Hack, 727 I street, Sacra
mento, Cal."
The Coroner telegraphed to young
Hack's father at Sacramento, telling him
of the double tragedy.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 7, 1896.
BLOW IT THE
JURY SYSTEM
Important Decision Ren
dered by the Supreme
Court.
POWERS OF A JUDGE.
He Must Be Convinced Beyond a
Doubt, as Well as the
Jurymen.
MAT SET ASIDE ANT VERDICT.
Theories Which Enlarge the Judicial
Power Until It Becomes Almost
Absolute.
"In the exercise of that power he should
always satisfy himself that the evidence,
as a whole, is sufficient to sustain the ver
dict found, and if in bis sound judgment
it does not he should unhesitatingly say
so and set the verdict aside."
This comprehensive paragraph is from
an opinion of the Supreme Court rendered
yesterday. The case decided was that of
the people against Christian Knutte,
charged with obtaining money under false
pretenses, and the major portion of the
opinion was devoted to defining the
powers of a Judge to set aside the verdict
of a jury.
The opinion gives a Judge practically
unlimited power over the verdict. He
must be convinced of the guilt of the pris
oner beyona a reasonable doubt, says the
Supreme Court, just as required of an
ordinary juryman, and then if he be not
convinced he may set aside the jury's ver
dict, even though the jury be unanimous;
and all because he (the Judge) may not be
convinced.
It has all along been considered proper
forejudge to set aside the verdict of a
jury when such verdict was entirely at
variance with the law and the factsâ when
the verdict is manifestly one born of sym
pathy, malice, ignorance or other apparent
cause; but the Supreme Court in its
opinion says nothing about such cases,
only that the Judge himself must be con
vinced of the prisoner's guilt or inno
cence, or the verdict may â and, indeed, by
the Supreme Court's direction mustâ be
set aside. There would seem to be but
little use for the jury under the circum
stances, and at once the Judge assumes a
position of power little short of absolute.
The Knutte case was a peculiar one. At
the conclusion of the prosecution the de
fense asked for an instruction to acquit,
and the instruction was given, the reason
being that in the judgment of the court
the case against the prisoner had not been
established. There was no testimony sub
mitted for the dejenee, and the jury found
the defendant guilty, regardless of the
instructions of the court, and then the
court set aside the verdict and granted the
defendant a new trial. From this order
granting a^ new trial the people appealed,
and the Supreme Court has affirmed the
order.
The point was made that the action of
the court was an abuse of its discretion.
This discretion, the Supreme Court says,
is not arbitrary, but like any other judicial
function, it must be exercised under the
sanction of the judicial oath, and the
strong presumption U that it was so exer
cised. Continuing, the opinion says:
While It is tne exclusive province of the jury
to find the facts, It is nevertheless one of the
most important requirements of the trial
Judge to see to it that this function of the jury
is intelligently aud justly xercised.
The Judge has the witnesses before him
and â¢ * * an equal opportunity with the
jury to observe the manner of the witnesses,
the character of their testimony and to judge
of their incredibility and to discover their mo
tives. He ought to be satisfied that the evi
dence as a whole was sufficient to sustain the
verdict. If he was not, it was not only the
proper exercise of a legal discretion, but his
duty, to grant a new trial.
Nor docs it affect the question that the evi
dence in the case may have a legal tendency to
prove all the material facts. Guilt is to do es
tablished beyond a reasonable doubt, and
while there may be some evidence to support
each fact this does not signify that it is neces
sarily such as to satisfy the conscience of the
Judge that a case is made which warrants con
viction.
There have been several cases in the
courts lately which have brought the prin
ciples annunciated in the opinion into
prominence. Some weeks ago Judge Dain
gerfield instructed the jury to find for the
plaintiff in a certain action and the jury
did so, although afterward each one
averred that his vote would have gone the
other way haa it not been for the court's
order. This, however, was a civil case.
More recently judge Bahrs has exercised
the pame power in two criminal cases. In
the trial of the charge of embezzlement
against Burnett O. Haskell the jury was
instructed to acquit after the case for the
people had closed. The jury rstired and
came back into ccurt and demanded the
testimony for the defense. It was given
and once more the jury was instructed to
acquit. This time, however, the jury dis
agreed and Judge Bahrs discharged the
prisoner. There was no appeal to the
Supreme Court. The case was ended
there.
In the case of one Godfrey, also before
Judge Bahrs, the jury found the man
guilty, but Judge Bahrs set the verdict
aside and granted Godfrey a new trial.
There was no doubt about the assault, and
the main question was whether or not it
had been provoked. It would have done
just well as bad Judge Bahrs passed upon
the case at once instead of holding twelve
men for two days and then setting aside
their verdict.
Carry to their limits the provisions of
the opinion and there will soon be no use
for a jury at all. The opinion suggests
that the discretion it allows be exercised
under sanction of the judicial oath, but
there is no limit set to the judicial oath
and nothing to show how far a Judge may
proceed and still be under its sanction.
THE NEW CHAHTER.
The Board of Freeholder* Will Discuss
Its Principal Points.
The Merchants' Association has taken
up the cause of the new charter in earnest,
and no efforts will be spared to effect its
adoption. At the quarterly meeting of the
association, which will be held in Beet-
hoven Hall at 336 Post street on the even
ing of March 12, the proposed charter will
be the special matter for consideration.
Many prominent speakers will be prestnt.
In order to bring out the most important
points the freeholders who framed the
charter will be requested to tell why they
introduced the various parts in the docu
ment. A number have promised to speak.
Joseph Britton, the president of the
Freeholders' Convention, will address the
meeting upon the charter in general; I. J.
Truman will speak on the legislative de
partment, George T. Marye on tne Police
Department, Dr. Jerome A. Anderson on
the Health Department and J. J. O'Brien
on the civil service article in the new
charter. The other seven Freeholders will
be requested to speak upon the subjects of
which they were chairmen in the Free
holders' Convention, and no doubt they
will all cheerfully comply with the request
of the association.
IT WAS A LIVELY SET-TO.
Evan J. Coleman and Frank Smith En-
tertain a I. urge linproiutu Audience.
A lively fight took place about 3 o'clock
yesterday afternoon in front of the Occi
dental Hotel between Frank Smith of that
caravansary and Attorney Evan. J. Cole
man, president of the Pacific Transfer
Company. The difficulty occurred over
an old account between Major Hooper of
the hotel and Mr. Coleman.
Mr. Smith and the latter gentleman
happening to meet their conversation
turned from general matters to the sub
ject of the old account. Before they knew
of it they were both hotly disputing the
respective positions of each other as to the
money due. At this juncture Mr. Smith
is credited with passing the lie to his op
ponent. Coleman had a cane in his hand
and he brought it down on Smith's head,
inflicting a long, deep wound across the
forehead, from which the blood flowed
fast and plentifully.
It was then the boniface's turn. He
waded in and did several things to Mr.
Coleman, knocking him down and pre
paring to give him more blows. How
ever, mutual friends from the large crowd
which had congregated rushed in and
separated them. No arrests were made.

It is said that Mr. Smith and Mr. Coleman
shook hands when they at first met,
neither apparently at that time scenting
the trouble that was precipitated.
The following letter is self-explanatory :
Friday Evening, March G, 189t>.
Editor Callâ Will you kindly publish this cor
rection of a ridiculously untrue account in to
day's Post of an encounter between Mr. Smith,
clerk at the Occidental Hotel, Rnd myself, in
which the uameof James V. Coleman was con
founded with my own. The facts, briefly
stated, are br follows:
I met Mr. Smith by accident on Montgomery
street, near the Occidental Hotel. In the
course ol a friendly conversation in regard to
certain business matters which had caused
some friction between the manager of the Occi
dental Hotel and the United Carriage Company
(of which I am president) Mr. Smith offensively
remarked that he did not believe the statement
1 had in-t made.
1 asked him if he meant to say that what I
had stated was not true. He replied that he
did. Thereupon I struck him in the face with
a small cane I had in my hand. In the brief
struggle which followed be scratched me
slightly on the face and I inflicted several
severe blows with my cane on his head. Some
person, to me unknown, in the endeavor to
draw me away, caught me about the waist,
pulling me down to tbe sidewalk. The fall I
received through the kindly meant interfer
ence of this gentleman was the only incon
venience I suffered. The whole affair was over
in a few moments. Respectfully,
Evan J. Coleman.
WILLIAM 6. MARCT DEAD.
lie Was in California Before the Ameri
can Occupation.
William G. Marcy died at an early hour
yesterday morning at the Crocker Old
People's Home, to which he moved with
his family on November 30 last to spend
the remainder of their days. The Ala
meda Argus says of the deceased:
William George Marcy has bÂ«en a prominent
figure in the history of this State. He was
born in Troy, N. V., in October, 1818. After
finishing his education, be engaged in the
banking business in Albany and New York.
At the age of 21 he was made paying teller of
the Bank of Commerce of New York. In 1846
he was commissioned a captain in the commis
sary department of tbe United States army,
ana was assigned to duty with and accom
panied the First Company of New York Volun
teers (Stevenson's regiment) to California.
He arrived at San Francisco March 20, 1847.
Monterey was the military headquarters of the
Department of tbe Pacific 1 , and he succeeded
General Sherman in his duties at that post,
lie remained in charge until after the close of
the Mexican war. He was secretary of the
first Constitutional Convention, which was
beid at Monterey, and was associated with the
late Washington Bartlett, at one time Mayor of
San Francisco and afterward Governor of Cali
fornia, it the first State Printing Office of Cali
fornia.
In 1853 Captain Marcy was appointed pay
master in the United States Navy by President
Pierce. lie filled this position for seventeen
years, seeing service In various parts of the
world. One of his cruises was in the old frigate
Cumberland, when she was the flagship of the
African squadron. The Cumberland was sunk
during the Civil War by the Confederate iron
clad Merrimac, in Hampton Roads, her crew
firing a broadside while sinking. When he re

he was greatly respected, having been a mem
ber of the Board of City Trustees.
Captain Marcy was a son of William L.
Marcy, who, during President Pierces ad
ministration, was regarded as one of the ablest
statesmen and brightest politicians in the
country. He was a Justice of the Supreme
Court of New York, afterward becoming State
Controller, and wai then chosen State Senator.
He had not completed his term as Senator
when he was urged to stand as a candidate for
the governorship. He did so, was elected and
held the office three consecutive terms. He was
Secretary of War during the Mexican War, and
during President Pierces administration was
Secretary of State, with additional luster to his
reputation.
The Mnrcy home in Alameda was at 2603
Santa Clara avenue, at the corner of Broad
way, and was sold shortly before bis with
drawal to the Crocker home.
The deceased was a prominent member
of tbe Society of California Pioneers, and
will be buried under tne auspices of this
organization.
THE DEAOHOUSES
OF CHINATOWN.
Health Officer Lovelace
Will Investigate the
Dens at Once.
TO SUPPRESS THE EVIL.
Board of Health Was in Ignor
ance of the "Chambers
of Tranquility."
DECLARED PUBLIC NUISANCES.
Unknown Horrors of the Mongolian
Quarterâ Secrets Not Shown
to White Visitors.
The Call's expose of the deadhouses of
Chinatown came as a surprise to almost
everybody in the City. Certainly it was a
great surprise to the Health Office, and,
for the most part, to the police as well.
Some of the Chinatown policemen knew
in a vague sort of way of the existence of
these ghastly dens, out they had never
before, so far as is known, been pene
trated by white men until those who
made the investigations for The Call se
cured an entrance into the Pacific-street
"chamber of tranquility.''
And so The Call's story yesterday
morning was news not only to its general
| readers, but to the officials of the City as
well. ]So complaints have ever been made
before, and no policeman ever had occa
sion to penetrate these noisome and
ghastly thresholds. Their occupants are
quite orderly; they are called "chambers
of tranquility. "
And the name is true enough in a mate
rial sense. Those who pass the portals of
the?e "chambers" make no disturbance,
do nothing of their own will to break
the peace or attract Attention. They go in
dying. They come out in rude coffins.
Oh, yes, they are "Chambers of Tranquil
ity" â if the absence of noise denotes tran
quility.
But the sufferings of the dying! Well,
that is a circumstance the Chinese code
takes no cognizance of, and then the living
corpses interred in these deadhouses can
not suffer long â they usually die within a
week, or a fortnight at most, and some
times within a day or two. So why bother
about that part of it? This is the Mon
golian-view of the case.
The Christian reasons from a different
basis and does not measure time altogether
by mathematic calculation. Time is rela
tive and a dying man, housed in a dank
and foul room, within touch, sight and
smell of grinning sseletons and rotting
corpses, may suffer, perchance, even
though a heathen, eternities of agony in a
week or a day.
And this humane view of the case is
sufficient, it is thought, to secure the
prompt action of the officials. The
Health Office will act promptly. Dr.
Lovelace, the Health Officer, was greatly
surprised when he read of the horrors of
these "Chambers of Tranquility" in The
Call yesterday.
"1 had no idea," he said, "that such
places could exist in this City, even in
Chinatown, and I believe the public owes
a debt of gratitude to The Call for mak
ing known this state of affairs. I shall
make a personal examination of these
places at the very earliest possible moment
and have them suppressed.
"They are a menace to the health of the
entire neighborhood, of course, and at all
events there is sufficient warrant for inter
ference on the grounds of humanity. The
dying ones who are housed in these dens
must suffer tortures, being so supersti
tious about death. It would be a horrible
fate for the bravest white man who has no
superstitions at all.
"It is not a little strange, I think, that
these deadhouses have never before been
exploited. However, now that the evil
has been made public you may depend
upon it that we will act at once."
There is, of course, ample authority in
law for the suppression of these Chinese
deadhouses by tbe proper authorities. It
is a well-established custom in Chinatown
to preserve the bodies of deceased Mon
golians for shipment to China. In the
case of wealthy or well-to-do Chinese there
is no reasonable objection to this, because
the bodies are usually embalmed or pre
served in some sanitary metnod, or else
inclosed in hermetically sealed caskets.
But with the pauper Chinese who dies a
lingering death in these "chambers ot
tranquility" the case is different. Often
their corpses are kept in these rooms for
more than a week, nailed up in boxes,
with no precautions taken against decom
position. Section lof City ordinance 2457,
touching the burial of the deceased, is as
follows :
The bodies of all deceased persona dying
within the City and County of San Francisco,
also the bodies of all deceased persons brought
to this City and County for interment, must be
Interred or placed in a vault in some cemetery
within a period of five days from the occur
rence of the death of such person dying in this
City and County, and in the case of bodies
transported to this City and County for burial
within a like period of five days from and after
the date of arrival of such body.
If this law were strictly enforced in Chi
natown the entire quarter would be in a
much more wholesome and sanitary con
dition. There are also several ordinances,
as well as State laws, forbidding the own
ers of premises to maintain "foul or offen
sive" quarters that are in way "prejudi
cial to public health or comfort."
DEATH OF A SALOON-KEEPER.
K. B. Loth Dies in the Receiving Hospi
tal From Morphine Poisoning*
E. B. Love, a retired saloon-keeper, died
last evening in the .Receiving Hospital
from the effects of an overdose of mor
phine. Love, who, prior to his death, had
been stopping at the International Hotel,
returned to his room early yesterday
morning presumably in a state of intoxi
cation. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon the
bedmaker called at the room and found
him lying on the bed in an unconscious
condition. The ambulance was sum
moned and the unfortunate man was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, but after
arriving it was found that.be had died on
the way.- Up to a few months ago Love
was the proprietor of the Boston Exchange
on Howard street. He sold out ana in
vested his money in other enteprises,
which proved failures. This fact leads
many of his friends to believe that he took
the, morphine with suicidal intent, but
this theory will be left for the Coroner's
jury to decide.
Forged a Money Order.
Joseph Ott was arrested by the postal in
spectors yesterday for forging a postal oider
for $760 and collecting the money. A letter
containing the order and intended for another
person of the same name was delivered to Ott.
He was released on $1000 bonds.
AMONG THE UNIONISTS.
Two Crafts Over Which the
Clouds of Adversity Are
Hovering.
Other Organizations Report New Mem
bers and a Better Condition
of Trade. â¢
T. F. Burns presided at the meeting of
the Trades Council last evening, where
several interesting reports upon the condi
tion of labor in this City were made. In
response to a letter of inquiry nearly all of
the labor unions sent communications
stating that their organizations are in favor
of the declaration of principles submitted
by the labor convention, and in favor of
the unions entering into politics as advised
by the convention recently. There is one
body that does not favor the latter move.
The theatrical stage employes sent a letter
dccl ining to enter into politics in any man
ner or form.
E. W. T hurman of the Typographical
Union made a very gloomy report of the
condition of his craft. He said that since
the introduction of typesetting machines
the number of printers thrown out of em
ployment has been increasing at an alarm
ing rate.
Notwithstanding the scarcity of work in
this City, dozens of idle printers continue
to pour in from all sections of the country.
He said that in this City there is but one
of the large daily papers that continues to
employ hand printers. C. M. SbortriJge,
proprietor of The Call, promised the print
<rs not to use typesetting machines for
eighteen months, and to this paper only
could the printers look for relief. At the
present time there are over three hundred
printers in San Francisco, he said, ana
among this number not a few are in desti
tute circumstances and with families to
provide for. Something must be done, he
said, to prevent the craft from being
starved out of existence. Delegate Thur
man stated that all of the job printing of
fices are filled, but even in job printing
oftices there is a very dark future. Already
the typesetting machine has found its way
into job offices where briefs and such things
are set. Where the bosses can save three
quarters of the cost of composition by the
use of machines there will be but little
chance for those who set type by hand.
The delegate of the Boiler-makers'
Union reported that his organization ia in
a very bad way, there being only four
teen paying members. The bad condition
of the trade is the cause for this state of
affairs.
The delegates of the other unions pre
sented reports that were pleasing con
trasts to those precedine. The iron
molders' delegate said that the union is
gaining in membership and the trade is
constantly increasing. "At the rate we
are booming along," ha said, "we hope to
be back soon to where we were before the
great strike."
Delegate Burznan of the woodworkers
said that since his union had'afSliated
with the international body the craft has
been making great strides. All the wood
workers in the City are coming into the
organization and similar reports are com
ing in from all parts of the United States.
Delegate Burns of the organizing com
mittee spoke of the garment-worJSers, who
have recently perfected an organization.
He said that the body will receive its
charter on Tuesday evening, when it will
select its permanent officers.
Sold Unstamped Cigars.
Yee Sing pleaded guilty to selling unstamped
cigars and was fined $50 by United States Dis
trict Jndge Morrow yesterday. In default of
the payment of the fine he was sent to- jail.
