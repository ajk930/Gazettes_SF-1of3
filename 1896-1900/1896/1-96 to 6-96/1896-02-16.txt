[Copyright, 1896, by the NÂ«w York Times.]
LONDON, Kno., Feb. 15.â A week of
Parliament has not done much to illumine
the perplexed British mind or to tranquil
lize the British nerves. Undoubtedly its
t Hicf effect has been to rub into public
consciousness new doubts and reservations
about Lord Salisbury's fitness for his
place. Every debate which has arisen has
atitoniaticallv iiung around like the needle
in a compass to point out some new fool
ishness or wanton contradiction in his
ppceches, and Balfour had to pet up 50
many times to defend or explain away his
uncle's indiscretions and banalities of ut
terance that latterly when he arose the.
wnole house tittered ana even the
nephew's loyalty could not prevent his
showing that he saw the joke and pri
vately was rather tempted to laugh him-
Felf. The perception of this curious situa
tion may be the sole source o! the rumor
which 1 have neard hinted at from several
end different quarters of the House of
Commons last night, namely, that Lord
bury 's health is very queer and his
disappearance from the public scene will
not be long deferred.
It trust be several years ago that I re
ported information coming to me from a
perfect source to the effect that Salisbury
had been warned by physicians that he
was definitely in the grin of Bright's dis
ease; but that is a malady which often
gives to its victims a very long rope, and
nothing now recalls it to mind except the
1 leral feeling among politicians that ex
w pt on the theory that he is going to pieces
is recent perform a aces are unaccountable.
Nobody, however, suggests that there is }
anything the matter with Chamberlain.
His triumphs at "Westminster have been
quite of a piece with the popular success
which he won before the session began.
It is true that a close observer may dis
cover that a bulk of the Tory members sit
sourly silent when he is cheered and eye
him with moody dislike, but they do not
dare to do more, and he Haunts his orchid
boutonniere and smart, glib, cocksure de
portment in their bulky faces with evident
enjoyment. According to his story, he
has figuratively mopped the earth with
Cecil Rhodes. He grew almost pathetic in
his picture of that once great mairs re
duced dimensions. One would think that
he returned to South Africa like a prodigal
son whose father slammed the door in his
face, destitute, dejected, to be^in life over
again in remote exile. Mr. Chamberlain's
cold, sparkling eyes almost managed a
tear for this melancholy soectacle, and the
listening House uttered sympathetic
"hear, hears" which might have been
taken for groans.
But if you talk in chartered company cir
cles it is to find an extraordinarily different
view prevailing as to the position of
K nodes and his partners. They got rid of
the costly responsibility of police and
other administration without any curtail
ment of benefits, and they began to see in
the whole transaction merely a promise of
larger dividends than ever; being gentle
men who are not engaged in expanding
the empire for their health, they are able
to contemplate this prospect with a smile.
It is nol likely that much new light will
be thrown on the present or future state of
the Venezuelan controversy by the debate
which is expected to begin Monday. Sir
William Vernon Harcourt has made a
specialty of the subject the last two
months and prepared for a comprehensive
and powerful attack on the Government,
but the Queen's speech rather takes the
wind out oi his sails. No disposition has
been disclosed among the private Tories
to say disa^reeaole things of the topics,
mid the official Tories profess such a com
plete anxiety to settie everything to
America's liking that it seems somewhat
bootless to bombard the loner since aban
doned fortifications where Salisbury in
trenched himself on the Schomburghk
line. There is no reason whatever to
suspect that these ofiioial professions of a
desire to arrange the matter amicably con
ceal any ulterior design, and that being
the case it seems as if the thing might
with profit be taken out of newspaper dis
cussion for a week or two at least and left
to the two foreign offices where it belongs.
Somehow it had not been easy at any
time during the week wholly to credit the
linality of Sexton's refusal to become the
head of the party. Healy b letter to-day,
in which he goes to the 'ength of offering
to retire from public life if Sexton will
f-ay that it will promote harmony and en
able him .to accept the post, removes the
last chance of the Dillon and O'Brien
ci-.que to misrepresent the situation from
Â«v least that point of view. If Sexton still
persists in holding back it will be interest
ing to wait and see how long it is before
he gets the post of president of the Irish
National Bar.k. No secret is made of the
fact thai if I). lion forces his election to the
chairmanship Tuesday the party will at
once break in..
W extern Europe and even America may
ponder with profit on the fact that the
only visible result ..f (he slaughter of many
thousands ot Armenians has been that the
( zar and the Sultan are now warm allies.
It is interesting, too, to note that they find
their lirst opportunity to appear arm in
arm in Sofia, where Sianibouloffs butch

oath sworn to his bride and her parents
have made it possible for the Czar to be
friendly with the Bulgarians and for the
Sultan to bestir himself to secure his vas
sal's recognition by the courts of Europe.
It was as if little Prince Boris had received
a double baptism of blood, once in the
murder-pit of Sassoun and once in the
gutter in front of the Sofia Club. Not even
in Paris do men pretend that this spectacle
is not repulsive. Nobody is to object to
the recognition of Ferdinand, however.
More importance attaches to the impend
ing interview at Mentone between the
Emperor of Austria and President Faure
ilian is generally imagined. It will not be
surprising, indeed, if this meeting will not
come, in after years, to be regarded as a
historical event.
Berthelot was somewhat sniffed at when
he left his laboratory to take charge of the
foreign affairs of the republic, bnt men
laugh no longer, H"e has already done
great things toward lifting France out of
the ruinous chauvinistic morass in which
she had floundered, and this sign of possi
ble understanding; with Austria promises
even more notable results; but very likely
these will soon be exhibiting themselves.
The present French Cabinet has as
many lives as the proverbial cat. On
Thursday morning the whole press of
J'aris agreed in the prediction that the
Ministry would be dead by nightfall, but
when evening came, lo and behold! Bour
geois was not only still Premier, but had a
rousing vote of confidence' by the Chamber
of Deputies to show to his enemies. That
these continue 1 triumphs of the Ministry,
which has only a small minority of true
friends in the Chamber, has something
queer underlying them is, of course, perfect
ly well known, but there are many widely
varying explanations of what this some
thing is. There seems to be a portion of
truth in each of a dozen of these different
solutions of the problem. The Ministry
now possess such a huge collection of com
promising facts relating to any number of
separate scandals that it is believed to hold
a threat of disclosure over fully 300
Deputies, which is more than half the
Chamber. It is said on apparently
good authority that not less than 250 are
involved in some phase of the South of
France railway and telephone contract
scandals alone, and these are only two out
of a large assorted collection. Thus it
happens that even when the present Min
ister of Public Instruction is confronted
by extremely embarrassing proof of his
own bad behavior in the railway matter
the Cabinet is able to force the Chamber
to ignore the thins; and to embark instead
of combat with the Senate. These two
bodies have not before been in open con
flict since the constitution of the republic
was adopted and no precedent exists to
help to guess as to how the deadlock
will terminate. Under ordinary circum
stances such a struggle might easily pre
cipitate a prrave constitutional crisis, but
nobody seems to fear that it may happen in
the case for the simple though unpleasant
' reason that the ministry is believed to
! have eno ;gb secrets of personal corrup
tion up its sleeve to bring the Senate to its
knees if a real emergency arise.
Hungary's spirited determination to
make her millennial celebration memorable
in the history of the world, regardless of
e-pense, has already produced one very
painful side result. Among the numerous
magnificent plans was one to found a mu
seum of fine arts at Budapesth which
would make the rest of the world green
with envy, and the sum of $1,500,000 was
voted for a start. Of this $200,000 was in
trusted to Director Pulszsky, who is the
eldest son of one of Hungary's most cher
ished patriots of Kossuth's time, to travel
through Europe and buy old masters of
art with. Subsequently much more money
was sent to him, but soon it was discovered
that he was buying only absurd, pitiful
rubbish at wild prices, and not even pay
ing for that but running the Government
in debt. Then came the disclosure that he
had embezzled practically the whole huge
sum and allowed it to be taken from him
by a pack of adventurers of both sexes.
His conduct was so idiotic that friends of
his father's bad him certified as insane and
ran into an insane asylum, but a parlia
mentary hubbub was raised by the cleri
cals in revenge for the civil marriage legis
lation, with the result that Pulszsky is de
cided to be sane, and must be tried and
punished. A more unwelcome overture to
a year's national celebration may hardly
be imagined.
Scarcely subordinate in interest to the
direct issue of the chartered company has
been the extraordinary capture of the vir
tuous old Daily News by the Rhodes-Bar
nato combination. The change began
sharply on Monday, when the new editor,
E. T. Cook, took charge, and the amaze
ment has been growing day by day
through the week. It is supposed that
there must also have been some change in
the proprietorship or perhaps a change in
proprietorial investments to explain the
thing, but of this nothing is known.
The Liberals are aghast at the sugges
tion that their time-honored official organ
has sold them out, and are only less dis
gusted to see that W. T. Stead, who was
Cook's first chief on the Pall Mall Gazette,
has now a free hand over the Daily News
columns to boom Rhodes, Mme. Novi
koff, telepathy, ebosts and all the rest of
his either venal or asinine obsessions.
Whatever the explanation may be and
however soon a change again may be
made, it is clear enough that the Daily
News is irretrievably ruined. One week
has sufficed to destroy the work of fifty
years. Naturally this is advantageous for
the Daily Chronicle, which has been
climbing up over its decrepit rival ever
since Massingham and Norman ob
tained control, and no? it steps
into the position of the chief Liberal paper
of England quite by acclamation. Al
though it is evident that America is fully
abreast of Europe in expanding and de
veloping Roentgen's discovery some quaint
incidents of the process here may not be
duplicated on the other side. For in
stance, the Vienna Museum for some time
has possessed as its chief treasure an
Egyptian mummy which is swathed to
resemble a human being, but bearing an in
scription which suggested it to be an Ibis
instead. The thing was too rare and pre
cious to run the risk of unwinding its
bandages to solve this paradox, but the
shadow photograph now plainly reveals
the skeleton of a large bird.
Professor liergmann of Berlin utilized
the discoTery the other day for a surgical
operation, but at the same time made a
speech to the university class, warning
them of the possible dangers involved in
this weird multiplication of facilities for
diagnosis. He foresees that, now that the
position of metals, substances inside the
human form, may be traced with ease,
everybody who had been carrying bullets,

to himself will be possessed with the
passion to have them located and dug out,
and against this he protests fervently.
He says he made his special reputation
in surgery in the Russo-Turkish war by
never extracting a bullet necessarily more
than by anything else, and even in time of
peace, where antiseptic aids are at their
best, he earnestly deprecates all but
strictly essential operations of this nature.
The Prussian general staff are enthusi
astic over Count Zeppelin's steerable bal
loon, which can ribo 1200 yards, travel
eleven miles an hour, carry two tons, stay
up fully a week and ascend or descend
without throwing ballast or losine gas. It
utilizes aluminum in the motor and steer
ing gear, but the principal novelty is a
secret preparation or sizing making silk
entirely gas tight. The cost of one will be
|75,000, but its value in time of war as a
lookout over a vast range, either by sea or
land, will be incalculable.
The evening papers on Thursday picked
up bushels of extra vennies on the sub
ject of the north pole, but otherwise, in
the opinion of scientists here, nothinc has
been changed. It is not believed by them
that news from Nansen could possibly
come by the way that this report is said
to have traveled; but laymen remember
that scientists have often been beaten by
facts before, and so keep an open mind.
When I reported the report reaching me
that Dunraven already had an apology on
the way to America, it seems that my in
formant had information that such a
course had been insisted on by the Prince
of Wales at Sandringham. and took it
for granted that Dunraven had not
delayed to act on it; but he ap
pears to have held out over two
or three ocoan mails before he finally acted.
This characteristic behavior prepares every
body here lor the disclosure that the com
munication itself is inadequate and grudg
ing in tone, and if this be the case, after
the elaborate and persistent courtesy of
the New York Yacht (Jlub, you may be
sure that no one here whose opinion you
value will resent his being dealt with as he
deserves.
S. J. Solomon's election as associate by
the Royal Academy is popular among
painters, and at another time would have
called forth many congratulations, but it
happens to be overshadowed by the choice
of Edwin A. Abbey, which excites a wider
and more vigorous outburst of enthusi
asm. Despite his magnificent Boston Li
brary creations he is still regarded prima
rily as a black and white man, and illus
trators hail his election as a long belated
recognition of this art. It is noteworthy,
too, perhaps, that at such a time an Amer
ican, the vast bulk of whose work has
been done for America," should be chosen
over many Englishmen without a hint in
any quartc of the slightest jealousy on
national grounds. It is understood now
that plans to pass Sir John Everett Mil
lais over all have come to naught and that
he will bo elevated to the presidency
Thursday without opposition or any
pledge to regard himself as a warming
pan for somebody else.

ON THE EVE OF
A BIG BATTLE.

For and Against the
; Repeal Bill.
LEGISLATIVE CHAMPIONS
Hot Debate Promised When the
Measure Comes Before

DILATORY AND OTHER TACTICS.
How Huntington's Men Hope to Pre
vent a Vote in the
House.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 15.â The Goe
bel bill to repeal the Southern Pacific
charter is expected to be reached in the
Senate on Monday. The bill is taking its
course in the orders of the day, and at the
close of the session this evening was the
fourth case on the calendar, and the
measures ahead of the bill are of minor
importance and will be disposed. of with
great dispatch. Senator Goebel will lead
the fight on the floor of the Senate and
will make the opening speech in support
of the measure, and will be assisted by
Senator Taylor and others.
Senator Thomas H. Hays and Senator
Rozel Weissihger of Louisville will lead
the fight aeainst the bill and will vigor
ously resist every point.
Senator John Bennett of Richmond will
also make a speech against the passage of
tlie bill. While the opposition admits
that they have not sufficient strength to
kill the measure, they hope, by extended
discussion and keen parliamentary tactics,
to take up several days in delaying the
passage of the bill.
When the measure shall reach the House
it is there hoped to get the bili in the orders
of the day and follow the several hundred
measures already awaiting their turn for
passage. It is believed the friends of the
bill have sufficient strength to call the
measure up for immediate passage. This
they expect to do. The members of the
House maintain much indifference to the
measure, but it is well known tfaat the
measure has strong friends among leaders
in this branch, and the only visible hope to
defeat it is by preventing its coming to a
vote.
The Huntington people are rallying for
a big tight. Hunt:ngton has addressed
his letters to members in plain envelopes,
and, it is said, marked "personal on the
outside. The California friends of the
measure have taken every precaution to
see that members are informed on the
matter, and have sent communications
to every representative in both personal
letters and printed circulars, setting out at
length the mode of the passage of tLe bill
and every detail in connection with the
subject, and this has lent valuable aid to
the friends of the bill, who have gained a
conceded fight in the Senate. When the
bill has passed the upper branch Hunting
ton and his forces will openly oppose it.
A number of the members who iive at
such a distance from Frankfort as to in
volve a longer railroad journey and a
change of lines left for home early to-day,
after pairing off with some of the oppo
site party; others, who live within a few
hours' ride or did not succeed in pairing,
waited till the session adjourned. By
night the majority of them were out of
town, and things around tbe Capitol Hotel
and other resorts were comparatively
quiet. All the Louisville delegation went
down and with them quite a number of
others, including some of the mountain
county members, who have not been out
of Frankfort since their first arrival.
There is no reason why all of them
should not go. It really seems that any
one staying here is quite unappreciative of
the entire willingness or, you may say, the
intense desire on the part of the Hunting
ton managers to give them every oppor
tunity for enjoying themselvesâ free rides
on the "kyars" (even if it is against the
law specially made and provided) and free
board and lodging where it can be forced
upon the party in question, free drinks,
free almost anything else wanted â "if you
don't see it don't be afraid to ask for it."
"Will call a coupe and take you in a few
minutes; several of the fellows are going."
There are way 3 and ways of getting a
hold upon a man. If he cannot be got
one way try him with another; anyway,
get him.
The recess is quite a relief to those who
have been engaged in the active work of
the past week, Senator Goebel among the
number. Ha is a wonderful worker, and
though with the duties incident to his
connection with the several Senate com
mittees and the Democratic Steering Com
mittee and the caucus committee and
other things, he has more on his shoul
ders than any other man in the Legis
lature, he is always prompt in his attend
ance on the sessions and meetings, bright
and cheerful in appearance and seems pre
pared for anything that may turn ud.
While he is not at all uneasy about the
"bastard bill" introduced by Mr. Stiglitz,
he nevertheless keeps a close watch on it,
and it is well assured that he will be ready
for any emergency that may arise from
both bills being in the House at the same
time and will minimize its power to hurt
or delay the passage of his bill. The Sen
ator goes to his home in Covtngton this
evening and will probably go down to
Louisville to-morrow morning, but ne will
be on hand bright and early Monday
morning.
As indicated some days ago, John J.
McHenry of Ohio County, son of one of
the Southern Pacific incorporators, has ar
rived, and is quite actively at work
againat the bill, As far a3 can be learned
he has no other object in his visit at this
time. It is said that he has a good deal
of influence over Barnett, the member
from his county, to whom he wrote on the
subject last week; but it is very doubtful
if he can affect the votes of any others.
Though a banker in an interior Kentucky
town, he is a man who commands respect,
and people generally listen when he
speaks.
Mi*. McHenry is very frank in saying
that the repeal of the charter might be con
strued as reflecting on the motives and ac
tion of the incorporators. He is quite
right aboiit that, but auite wrong id sup
posing that there will be no reflection cast
if there is no repeal. The beet thing that
he can do is to stand up for the honor of
bis dead father's name in his position
that Henry D. McHenry was imposed
upon, and was not wittingly a tÂ»arty to the
infamous uses to which that charter has
been put, and insist on the repeal of the
charter.
His idea that repeal might affect the
stock of the company and result in loss
to the shareholders is evidently born from
are over 2000 such shareholders in the
the statement of Mr. Huntington that there
Southern .Pacific Company, most of whom,
it is inferred, have tneir all invested in that
stock and are dependent on the dividends
therefrom for victuals and clothes.
John McHenry was born with a sympa
thetic streak in his composition â not as
thick as a vein of his coaJ, it is true, but
still it is there â and his anxiety about
those suffering stockholders is commend
able; but if he inherited any of said stock
from his father his can vouch
for the fact that he has not had to build
any new vaults in his bank to hold those
generous dividends, nor did Mr.
Huntington send them to him in
a freightcar. It is not probable
thatjhis anxiety for those dependent stock
holders will keep Mr. McHenry away from
his bank long, and so the inhuman mon
sters who are planning to take the bread
out of their mouths will have to be Kept in
check by some one else. In fact, he does
not go away with the elastic buoyancy of
bearing that a man who has achieved a
great philanthropic success should wear.
He must have become discouraged, or may
be he got hold of some of Sutro's red-letter
literature on the subject of the Southern
Pacific oppression, and has experienced a
change of heart and purpose.
The Frisco bureau of education is doing
a deal of good in showing the people of
Kentucky the gravity of the issues in
volved in this repeal bill. The members
of the Legislature have all received a full
share of printed matter, well got up,
and many of them are reading all of it
very carefully, and from the opinions ex
pressed it is evident that the missives have
been sent to some purpose.
The extracts from the Colton letters are
a revelation â almost incredible to many
of them â while to some they are a power
ful warning. A Kentuckian who has got
as far up the political ladder a3 the
Legislature is likely to have an impression
on his inmost soul that there is nothing
that he cannot win if he keeps on, and he
is not quite brave enough to relish the
idea of having ia the years to come the
administration of the estate of some of
the parties interested, producing in court
any Frankfort "Coltou" letters in ".'hich
his name figured ; and this repugnance is
going to make him very cautious, if he
does it at all.
Rumor laid the paternity of the bastard
Stiglitz bill to several persons who have
been in Frankfort lately, but with little
reason, and in no case with less reason
than that of the Hon. Walter Evans, Con
gressman from the Louisville district. Mr.
Evans has not been in Frankfort sinco
early in the session, and while he is ac
quainted with Stiglitz that fact is only ad
ditional proof that he did not have any
thing to do with his having charge of the
bill. Then, too, Walter Evans is a con
scientious, upright man. He is not inter
ested, as attorney for Huntington or other
wise, in the fate of the measure and he
would lend himself to no trickery looking
to coupling its defeat and Hunter's success
together, even though he is a good Repub
lican and a strong partisan. He always
stays within the limits of decency and
honesty.
Mr. Stiglitz will have to foster-father
that bill himself until he is ready to tell
who is the real father. That he and Mr.
Freeman will nurse it carefully and guard
the secret as closely as possible is assured,
but when they get around among the boys
in Louisville to-night and to-morrow Billy
is very apt to be questioned, and will inad
vertently drop a pointer that will be
picked up by some of the newspaper boys
down there and followed up to the end.
Mr. Goebel has taken no notice of the
discourtesy put upon him by Stiglitz's
action as yet, and it is presumed that he
will not. He is rather above being
affronted by Air. Stiglitz in that way.
Goebel is one of the best hands in the
whole Legislature at "sawing wood" with
out uttering more than an occasional re
mark, so whatever he thinks about the
Stiglitz "brat" and its foster-father he
knows that it is not any kin to his, and he
will watch it all the same and even put it
to sleep when the time comes. One baby
and one bill of the game name in the
House at the same time are quite enough,
the Senator thinks.
Goebel and the others are dispos
ing of the open arguments of the
anti - repealers very readily, but they
are at a disadvantage, having other duties
in hand, in having opposed to them a
well-organized and well-handled set of
men of great experience in promoting or
thwarting legislation, as the case might
be, and who are working continually and
only for the interests of their masters. If
there was nothing to fear but upon parlia
mentary tactics and a fair vote all would
be assured ; but there is much also to fear,
as any one acquainted with Jluntington
well knows. Senator Weissinger an
nounced in the Senate that the railroad
would "dispute the passage of the bill over
every inch of the ground." He might
have truthfully added, "and by 6very
means known to influence men."

CONSTANTINOPLE, Tcrrey, Jan. 31.â
Thirteen thousand armed men are said to
be in Zeitoun and it is surrounded by 35,000
soldiers stationed at five points. But these
latter, by reason of bein^ insufficiently
clothed and fed, are dying at the rate of
forty a day. Special trains from Mersin
and Adapa have been loaded with bread
to be forwarded. Many of the inhabitants
of the besieged city have donned the
clothes of those they have captured, and
come and go at their leisure. A few of
them met a camel train of seventy animals
conveying bread to the Turkish troops.
Accosting them as brothers and expressing
their sense of grateful satisfaction over the
trouble they had been taking in order to
feed the suffering troops, they led them
straight into their city.
It is generally supposed in Adana (where
nothing is yet known of a mediation) that
some sort of an armistice has been agreed
upon till March 1.
The following letter dated January 9
from a city outside of the six provinces in
the interior gives a good idea of the pres
ent state of affairs iv many parts of the
interior:
"I wish to speak only of the present con
dition of Armenians herein its absolute
ly hopeless outlook for the future as long
as this Government is in power. It is now
nearly six weeks since the massacre and
the professions of the Government of sor
row for the unfortunate event have had
time to prove sincere or false. The officials
seem exceedingly friendly toward for
eigners and accede to all their reasonable
requests. Their cordiality in the matter
of the relief expedition of the devastated
villages was marked. The Americans say
that when called upon in reference to any
business the officials receive them era
ciously and promise hearty aid. Theyare
also assured that there is no possibility of
a repetition of such wickedness.
â¢'The one thing, however, which mars
our confidence in these assurances is the
fact that all officials from the Governor
down were equally loud in their assur
ances previous to November 30. Before
that day we believed them; we thought
that the authorities really intended to
keep quiet, and since that day we can only
say that we have no longer any confidence
in the word of any Turk as to security of
life and property.
"The only effective means of preventing
a recurrence of this massacre, the stern
and swift punishment of a.ll concerned as
far as ascertainable, is wholly neglected.
Those Armenians who loiged complaints
at first are afraid to follow up their testi
mony, because of the threats against them
selves, which they fear.
"If the Government was in earnest they
could assure protection to witnesses, but
that they evidently do not intend to do. I

BERLIN, Germany, Feb. 15.â Tne in
vectives which for sotno time were hurled
by the semi-official press against England
had a lull last week, but this week they
have been renewed but in a somewhat dif
ferent vein. Though these expressions
are more guarded than formerly they in
dicate that the German Government is
thoroughly dissatisfied with the statements
which have been made in Parliament by
the British Ministers in regard to the situ
ation and England's relations in the
Transvaal.
Nor does this condition of affairs fur
nish the only grievance which Germany
has, according to these sources of informa
tion. There is reason to state, it is al
leged, that the advices received at the For
eign Office from South Africa are of a char
act r that tend greatly to increase the
etrain upon the relations between England
and Germany.
Although the Berlin press is almost
unanimous in praising the frankness oi
the statements made in the Reichstag by
Freiherr Marschall yon Bieberstein, Min
ister of Foreign Affairs, in the debate on
the Transvaal situation on Tnursday, in
which he declared that nothing had oc
curred to change the good relations be
tween Germany and England, an analysis
of the Foreign Minister's statement and
the White Book containing the Transvaal
correspondence disclose a notable and suc
cessful concealment of the very things
t:.at the public are most desirous to know.
Freiherr Marschall yon Bieberstein as-
Bured the Reichstag that the Wnite Book
contained all of the documents in the
possession of the Government bearing on
the subject, but any one looking in the
book for the all-important telegram from
Pretoria, of December 31, mentioned in
the dispatch to Count yon Hatzfeldt, Ger
man Embassador to Great Britain, would
fail to find it. and this is only one instance
out of several wherein important commu
nications have been suppressed.
There is no doubt, however, that the
.Foreign Minister's vindication of Ger
many's rights in the Transvaal is ap
proved by the whole of Germany, the
Hamburger Corresoondenz going to the
length of saying that the Transvaal and
Delayoa Bay, the ground with the strip of
Portuguese territory between Delagoa Bay
End the Transvaal, are under the protec
tion of the European powers. The North
Gei*man Gazette, however, corrects this
statement as being in conflict with the
recognized political and territorial situa
tion.
Germany, the Zeitung asserts, does not
claim the right to such protectorate as the
Correspondenz describes and declares that
the main point of Germany's dispute with
England is that of the former's safeguard
ing herself against England's encroach
ments upon German interests in South
Africa.
The speech delivered by Freiherr Mar
â¢chall yon Bieberstein in the Reichstag,
which has been revised and publisheu in
the Reichsanzeiger, the official gazette, puts
the whole case in one sentence, thus: The
German Government wili uphold the status
quo of Delagoa Bay and also the rights in
volved in the ownership of the German
railways and the maintenance of the inde
pendence of the South African Republic,
as guaranteed by the treaty of 1884.
The Cologne Gazette, while warning
England not to interfere in the internal
reforms of the Transvaal, advises the Boers
to remove any possible pretext for such
interference by granting some concessions
to the Uitlanders.
The Vossische Zeitung says that Eng
land if she is desirous of living upon good
terms with Germany must become ac
customed to see Germans maintaining a
hold upon a part of the mainland of
{Southwest Africa, besides having interests
in South Africa. Germany, the Zeitung
Bays, has subjects there and must also pro
tect her right to save a nation allied with
her by race from brutal violence and to
compel respect for treaties.
The sum of the matter is that if Great
Britain should menace an attack upon the
South African ReDubiic upon the pretext
of defending British subjects in that terri
tory Germany wouid be unanimous in ap
proving the intervention of the imperial
Government in the most active form in
defense of the Boers.
The lower house of the Saxon Diet, after
a debate of two days upon the measure,
has referred the electoral bill to a special
committee. The bill proposes to abolish
the present electoral system and to sub
stitute therefor the system which prevails
in Prussia of indirect election in classes.
The first of these classes comprises those
having incomes of 10,000 marks a year; the
second, those receiving incomes of not less
than 2800 marks per annum, and the third
composed of workmen and ratepayers.
Each class elects one-third of the college
of electors whicii selects the deputies to sit
in the Landtac. The result of this system
would be that all of the workmen and rate
payers* comprising the third class would
be in a two to one minority in the electoral
college, and would, of course, have no rep
resentative in the Landtag.
In the course of the debate Herr
Mttzsch, Minister of the Interior and of
Foreign Affairs, avowed that the bill was
especially directed against the socialists,
and the Deputies of the latter party made
an attack upon the Government, charging
them at aiming to establish a system of
class despotism and persecution which
would surely lead to a revulsion of popu
lar feeling endangering all the institu
tions of the State.
Prince Bismarck, in an interview with a
member of the Saxon Diet this week, ad
vised a modification of the electoral bill
and expressed his strong disapproval of
the arbitrary provisions oi the measure iv
I classifying the Saxon electors. The ex
j Chancellor suggested a system of open
voting.
The strikes of the various trades union
men throughout Prussia are spreading
rapidly, and it is now estimated that 35,
--000 mintle-makers and female tailors are
out and all of the hatmakers of Berlin are
also on stride. The public have very nu
merously and generously subscribed
money for the support of the striking
seam-tresses, whoso long hours and
wretched pay, through their being ex
ploited by middlemen, have excited gen
eral compassion. Dr. yon Boetticher, Im
perial Secretary of State for the Interior,
has made a promise in the Reichstag that
the Government would make an inquiry
into the grievances of the seamstresses,
and inasmuch as a part of their work is
done at home the inquiry will without
doubt extend to the possibility of applying
for legislation regulating the work, hours.
pay, etc., of the trades whose labors are
performed in home apartments.
The congregation of the American
church in Berlin has held a meeting at
which a resolution was passed, signed by
the Rev. Dr. Dickie, pastor of the church,
as chairman, William Griscom and
Messrs. McFadden, Dunham and Harley,
expressing thorough appreciation of the
ability and official capacity of the late
United States Embassador Itunyon, es
pecially in defense of the interests of the

INTERPELLATED THE GOVERNMENT
Investigation Into the Railway Scandals
Promises to Causa Further Trouble
in France.
PARIS, France, Feb. 15.â 1n the Senate
to-day M. Moms, Republican, again inter
pellated the Government regarding the
appointment to conduct the investigation
into the Southern Railway scandals, of
Judge Pitevin instead of Judge Rampler.
A long debate followed.
Minister of Justice Ricard repeated his
defense of the Ministers previously made,
and advised the Senate to weigh well the
result of a vote in opposition to the opin
ion of the country. The Senate, however,
by a vote of I*3l to 71 continued the vote
taken in that tody on the 11th inst., plac
ing the blame in the matter upon the Gov
ernment.
M. Demole, Republican, whe represents
one of the divisions of Saone et Loire, an
nounced that he would await the steps
taken by the Cabinet inconsequence of the
vote and then, if necessary, interpellate
the Government concerning the responsi
bility of the Cabinet toward the Senate
and Chamber of Deputies. The Senate
then adjourned until Friday next.
After the vote on the interpellations, the
Ministers held a lengthy conference. It is
understood they decided that Prime Min
ister Bourgeois should lay the situation
before President Faure. There is great
agitation and uncertainty in political cir
cles, and rumors of the dissolution of Par
liament and a revision of the constitution
gain credence. Wiseacres are of the opin
ion that the fact that the Cabinet has not
resigned because of the adverse vote
marks the opening of a revolutionary par
liamentary contlict. The Courier de Soir
announces that the Cabinet will meet
again to-morrow.
RAN OUT THE "HEALER."
Rev. William Bailey Received
Tar and Feathers at North
Platte.
An Imitator of Schlatter. Who Made
Trouble in a Family and Had
to Move.
NORTH PLATTE, Nebr., Feb. 15.â
Rev. William Bailey, a preacher, was
tarred and feathered and ordered to leave
town by a vigilance committee, consisting
of 100 citizens, to-night. Bailey is an imi
tator of Schlatter. the Denver healer, and
has been working his so-called miracles all
winter.
The man had endeared himself to the
members of one of the families who had
believed in his faith, until he became so
frequent in manifesting his powers that
the husband ordered him to leave the
house and never return.
He paid no attention to the order, and
yesterday the husband, in sheer despera
tion, went to District Judge Grimes and
asked what to do in order to rid himself of
this man who was breaking up his family.
The Judge sympathized with the husband,
donned his hat, went to the house and
ejected the intruder. This act was heartily
approved by the citizens, and to-day's
papers contained sensational articles in re
gard to the affair.
The healer was ordered to leave town
to-day and disobeyed, and after dark the
mob was quietly organized to enforce the
order. The members of the mob deter
mined to brook no resistance to their
plans. They broke in the doors of the
house where the healer was stopping, and
after administering the tar and feathers
turned him loose, telling him that if they
caught him to-morrow he would be
lynched. He replied that if the Lord or
dered him to go he would. The "healer"
is a man of medium build, and appears
intelligent on all subjects but religion.
The people generally believe him insane.

NO CHANCE OF A FIGHT.
Maher's Eyes Are Worse and the
Date for Monday is, of
Course, Canceled.
FITZSIMMONS IS DISGUSTED.
Ready to Desert the Florida Athletic
Club and Journey Across the
Pond.
EL PASO, Tex., Feb. 15.â A member of
Maher's party, who arrived late to-night
from Las Cruces, says that Quinn has
knowledge of a breach in the articles of
agreement that will prevent Fitzsimmons
from claiming or receiving forfeit on Mon
day. He would, however, give no particu
lars.
Ad 8:30 to-night notice was sent out from
headquarters for aU the men matched in
the minor contests, together with their
principals, to meet to-morrow night when
the promoters will make the statement of
the situation and announce what course it
is intended to pursue.
It also developed to-night that the con
tract between the citizens and the Florida
Athletic Club and by the terms of which
the former agreed to provide the sum. of
$10,000 on condition that the lights take
place adjacent to this city, stipulates that
the agreement shall hold cood only if the
Fitzsiinnions-Miiher contest is brought off
between sunrise i-riday, February 14, and
sunset of Monday, the 17th.
If, therefore, Maher is unable to come
to time on Monday the citizens' commit
tee, should it be so disposed, can declare
the agreement null and void. There are
also rumors that the committee has been
unable to raise the full amount of the
guarantee. It is definitely known that
$:JOOO of the total is on deposit in the State
National, and it i 3 claimed but not cor
roborated that there is an equal sum in
the First National and $1500 in Newman's
Bank. Even this, however, would leave
the necessary total $2500 short.
An intimation from Manager Quinn
to-day that the Irishman's eyes were not
improving as rapidly as has been hoped
for, and another postponement will be nec
essary, has demoralized the sports, ruffled
phlegmatic Dan Stuart and his associates
and made Fiusimmons and Julian more
morose and taciturn than ever. The
Cornishnian, as a matter of fact, is sick of
the whole business, and it requires frequent
injunctions from Julian to "keep your
mouth shut and say nothing to anybody,"
to prevent him from breaking loose.
â \Vhen the manager was made acquainted
with the contents of Quinn's message by
the representative of the United Press he
beid a whispered consultation wiih his
principal and at its conclusion said with
emphasi3 that no further statement of
their intentions would be made until noon
of Monday. Those who know I'itzsimnions
and Julian best believe he has gone as far
as he intends to go and that if Maher does
not come in time on Monday he will claim
the forfeit and wash his hands of the
Florida Athletic Club and its promoters
for nood and all.
Since the offers from the London clubs
were received several days ago he has
more than once expressed himself to the
effect that he was weary of going to the
labor, expense and nervous worry of pre
paring for tights only to be hunted about
like a felon and find himself checkmated
at the last moment, when he could cross
the water with the assurance of a good
sized purse for a sure contest under repu
table auspices and with full protection. It
is believed that he is about ready to take
advantage of the present situation to cut
himself loose from Stuart and make a deal
with the Londoners.
When it became apparent that the Mon
day date was off there was a hurrying and
scurrying on the part of the visitors that
still remained to secure homeward-bound
accommodations. The big delegation from
Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and other
State points went off in a bunch this morn
ing, while for to-night every berth in the
outgoing Texas Pacific train was engaged
and it was necessary to put on an extra car
for the disappointed Eastern sports. Par-
I Bon Davies, Sullivan ana Ryan, however,
! who had intended to get away last night.
Btill linger, solely because the ex-cham
pion, having no dates ahead for a week,
put his foot down and declared that he
would not quit the congenial company
that he has found here until he had to.
Of the 2500 strangers who were
in the city on Thursday for the fight not
more than 200 remain, and a fifth of these
are correspondents. The promoters have
at no time oflculated that more than 250
tickets would be purchased by local peo
ple, so that even if the men should be got
together next week the crowd and the re
ceipts will alike be nominal as compared
with previous calculations.
There is wailing ana gnashing of teeth
among the white and colored prize
tuatchers for the minor contests and they
are beginning to make themselves heard.
With one or two exceptions they are
training down to the finest point they can
stand and are anxious to be called into
action and become footloose once more.
Strong representations were made to
Stuart yesterday and this morning that
by bringing off one or more of the sec
ondary contests on one of the six safe
battling grounds be is reported to have in
command he could keep the bulk of the
outside crowd in town until the status of
the Fitzsimmons-Maher mill will be finally
determined, but he was obdurate.
Walcott and Bright Eyes Collins, who
were to have fought to-day, came over
irom Juarez this morning and weighed in
at a vacant store in El Paso, and Tom
O'Rourke in behalf of Walcott waived for
feit from Stuart until Tuesday next. The
two darkies will remain in the city and
tinibh their training in the gymnasium
attached to the .Gem saloon.
Governor Ahuamada was advised to-day
that it had been stated at headquarters
that the ring has been erected and was in
shape for the men to enter, and that the
location could not be found by his crack
cavalry in a month. This nettled the
Mexican executive and mounted scouts
were at once cent out to intercept
the cavalry details up and down the fron
tier and urge them to redoubled efforts.
The Chihuahuan Governor is confident
that if the story is true the battle-ground
will be in surveillance before dusk Sunday.
The last message received from Las
Cruces before the telegraph-office closed
to-night said that Dr. Green, who is treat
ing Maher, was of the opinion that it
would be absolutely impossible for him to
fight on Monday. Some of the out-of
town sports and correspondents are suffer
ing from the sore-eye trouble, which has
been named "Alkali Peter," and one of
the Chicago writers is confined to a dark
ened room.
Late to-night two items were given out
from headquarters which may be taken
for what they are worth. One was that
Fitzsimmons had privately notified Stuart
that he would take the forfeit on Monday,
and the other that the Walcott-Collins
contest would positively be brought off on
Tuesday at a railroad point twenty miies
out of the city.
Parson Davies gave it out this evening
that on his return to New York in April
steps would be taken by himself, John L.
Sullivan.O'Rourke and others for the incor
poration of the National Sporting League,
membership to be composed of all persons
interested in athletic sports and pugilism,
and having for its object the opposition to
all candidates for Congress and State Leg
islatures who will not declare themselves
in favor of a wide-open door for fights,
races and all sports. The Parson says that
a similar organization exists in England,
and that at the general election it "turned
down" over 100 woula-be members of the
Commons.
STA RF O/iU'S A XIIL ETES.
Vractice Work on Court, Piamond and
Vinder Track.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Feb.
15. â The Tennis Club has had its courts
put into proper condition, in readiness for
the percentage tournament. The open
tournament, which is to decide what play
ers Stanford will pit against Berkeley, will
not take place for about a month. It is
hoped by the management that the per
centage tournament will be the nu-ans of
bringing out a number of good players
and will result in their keeping in prac
tice. At present Picher, '98, and Free
man, '99, are undoubtedly the best racquet
wielders at Stanford. Several of the play
ers here would make the champions hustle
should they get into practice again.
The baseball field is crowded each even
ing with players, and the prospects are
auspicious for the aggregation of a credit
able nine. The practice games demonstrate
the ability of several of the new men with
the oat. Captain McLaine says little of
what he expects to do against the Berkeley
nine this year, but he will take every pre
cauti n to have his team in such a condi
tion that U. C. will rind the contest inter
esting.
Forty men have appeared on the track
thus far, and as the work of several new
men is of a creditable character there is a
general expectation that Stanford athletes
will make a better showing in the inter
collegiate field-day contests than at previ
ous muets. Three new men are now prac
ticing for the mile walkâ Toll, '98; Hus
ton, '99, and Suzzallo. '99.

AN ATROCIOUS CRIME.
Two Women Burned to Death
and One Man Badly
Wounded.
Bloodhounds Placed on the Trail of
Assassins Who Burned a
Kentucky Home.
AUGUSTA, Ky., Feb. 15.â One of the
most atrocious crimes in the history of
Bracken County was committed here this
morning. Two women were burned to
death and a man badly wounded. About
daylight Robert Laughlin, living about
three miles west of Augusta, was awakened
by tue presence of a man at his bedside in
the act of placing a knife at his throat.
Laughlin reached" out and grabbed the as
sassin by the coat. At the same time the
man made a lunge at him, striking him
in the shoulder.
Seeing a second man in the room Laugh
lin jumped from bed and ran for the door,
closely pursued by the man with the
knife. Laughlin ran to a neighbor's to
give the alarm, leavine the house in flames.
Laujrhlin's wife and Miss May Jones, a
13-year-old girl spending the night with
them, were left in the burning building.
He says he never heard a sound from them
during his struggle with the men and be
lieves they were butchered before the mur
derers assaulted him. The bodies of the
unfortunate women -were found lying in
the cellar. No clew to the perpetrators of
the horrible deed r*as been obtained.
Lauglilin was a peaceful and respected
farmer.
Bloodhounds were put on the trail this
afternoon. The hounds worked directly
toward this city and strangely came to a
halt at the house where the parents of the
girl, May Jones, live; but here the scent
was lost. The town is in an uproar.
FIGHT WITH HUSTLERS.
Two of the Gang Killed and One
Wounded and Captured.
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Feb. 15.â Sheriff
John Owens and Stock Inspector Joseph
Lafors of Newcastle attempted to arrest a
party of cattle-rustlers who were in camp
on Beaver Creek last evening. The rustlers
resisted arrest and fired upon the officers.
Their shots were returned and a spirited
fight was kept up for several minutes in
which two of the rustlers, John Timnis
and Hank Thompson of Powder Hiver,
were killed. A third rustler, who was
wounded, was secured. The officers
escaped from the light uninjured.

WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 15.â With
the close of to-day the last day expired in
which the first payment of 20 per cent can
be made on the new bonds. The total pay
ments as reported to the treasury to date
aggregated $62,989,946, or more than 50
per cent of the total issue.
The Morgan syndicate paid in all its
purchase money to-day with the object in
view of catching any defaulting bidders'
bonds, to which they are entitled under
their blanket bid of 110.6877 for $100,000,000
or any part thereof. How many bidders
defaulted and in what amounts and who
they are, will not be known at the treasury
until Monday or Tuesday next.

the hour at which bidders could pay for
their bonds, reckoning from East to West,
three honrs later than New York time at
San Francisco and one hour later at
Chicasro and St. Louis.
At the clese of business to-day the
treasury gold reserve, with to-day's de
posits at New York excluded, stood at
$77,132,863. Since January 6, when Secre
tary Carlisle invited bids for the new bond
issue to date, $27,452,854 in gold has been
withdrawn from the treasury. Of this
amount $0,404,032 is reported as having
been withdrawn for export, and the
balance of $18,000,000 was withdrawn pre
sumably to pay for bonds. It is stated
from reliable New York advices that the
firm of Zimmerman &. Forshay alone have
withdrawn $5,851,633.

The treasury is prepared io deliver the
bonds as rapidly as called for.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 10.-To-day
was the last day for the first installment
on the new $100,000,000 4 per cents of 1925
just allotted by the Government. The
Sub-Treasury in consequence was jammed
by bond purchasers and it was almost im
possible to get into the coinroom. Assist
ant Treasurer Jordan gave notice at an
early hour that he would close the Sub-
Treasury doors at 1 o'clock sharp and that
no one would be permitted to enter after
that hour.
Another batch of $4,000,000 of the new
bonds arrived here to-day, making a total
of $S : 000.000 thus far received. Trans
actions on the board in the bonds were
heavy and one lot of $.507,000 sold at 115%.
The Hanover National Bank this morn
ing deposited $1,000,000 on bond account,
making the total since February 8, $38,613,
--991. Zimmerman & Forshay withdrew
$100,000, making tho total withdrawals
from February 8, $6,368,800.
A Boston special states that William
Graves of New Yoric yesterday sold his
option to take $4,500,000 new Governments
at 115.3391 to the City National Bank for
$30,000.
It is stated that the deposits of cold at
the Sub-Treasury and the National Bank
depositories amount to over $55,000,000.
Premiums on gold to-day were nominally
% to H per cent. Greenbacks were 1-16
bid, offered at y s per cent.
Wnen the doors of the Sub-Treasury
were closed at 1 o'clock Assistant Treas
urer Jordan announced that no new busi
ness would be done to-day. He said that
if it was found that any of the bond
bidders had made gold payments not up
to the amount required, arrangements
would be made for them to complete pay
ments later on.
It was announced to-day on high author
ity that Mr. Morgan's recent visit toWash
ington was for the purpose of consulting
with Secretary Carlisle in regard to de
faults of bidders. It was arranged that
Mr. Morgan should buy all the bonds not
taken by bidders at the same figure
(110.5877) paid by the Morgan syndicate.
The total amount of gold received by
the Sub-Treasury and the National Bank
depositories on bond account up to 1
o'clock to-day was $41,187,321. Of this
amount $3,373, 331 was turned into the Sub-
Treasury to-day.
William L. Graves, who was awarded
$4,500,000 of the bonds at 115.31. did not
pay in the 20 per cent installment on
them at the Sub-Treasury, and it is sup
posed he will lose the bonds. He was in
Washington, to-day, it is said, to ask for
an extension of time.
THROWING HIGH EXPLOSIVES.
(Secretary Herbert AÂ»kÂ» an Appropria
tion to Make Tests.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 15.â The
Speaker laid before the House to-day a
communication from Secretary Herbert re
questing an appropriation of $50,000 to
enable the Navy Department to test meth
ods of throwing high explosives from puns
on board & ship with ordinary velocities.
Recommending the allowance, Secretary
Herbert says that it is very desirable to
secure a safe method of throwing large
charges of high explosives, carrying safely
the necessary detonating compound at the
i ordinary velocities obtained in powder
guns. Methods have been presented, he
says, which can oniy be tested under spe
cial authority.
The Speaker also laid before the House
an estimate of an appropriation of $200,000
submitted by the Secretary of the Interior
as necessary to continue the survey of the
lands of the five civilized tribes in the
Indian Territory.
CARS RUM DOWN THE GRADE.
Thrilling Ride of Passengers on an Elec
tric Una at Butte, Mon
tana.
BUTTE, Mont., Feb. 15.â A frightful ac
cident was miraculously averted on a
streetcar line here at 6 o'clock this even
ing. Two electric orecars, heavily loaded,
pot beyond the control of the motorman
at the top of a steep two-mile grade and
rushed down at lightning velocity. A
passenger-car was coming up, but luckily
the motorman of the latter saw the run
away in time to reverse his car, and a run
for life began. The orecar overtook the
passenger-car in a few minutes, but the
collision was slight and both cars remained
on the track.
The cars now fairly flew over the track;
down the grade, around curves, over
bridges and high embankments they went.
Crowds of people watched from eveiy
point, every moment expecting to see the
cars leave the track and crush the passen
gers to death. At the foot of the long
grade, however, the ore car jumped the
track, throwing the motorman, Joe Nel
son, forward into the passenger car, break
ing his left leg in three places. He was the
only person seriously injured. The pas
senger car was soon stopped, the people in
it escaping with a bad scare and shaking
up. Superintendent Watchey, who was
on the ore car, was slightly injured while
climbing into the passenger car during the
flight down grade.
DEATH ENDS HIS MISERY.
Strange Suicide of the Son of a
Prominent Railroad
President.
Failing Health and Eyesight Cause
the Youth to Leave College and
Give Up in Despair.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 15. â William
Hughett, 22 years old, the youngest son of
Marvin J. Hughett, president of the Chi
cago and Northwesten Railroad Company,
committed suicide this afternoon in his
room of the family mansion, 2828 Prairie
avenue, by shooting a bul let from a 44
--caliber revolver into his temple, tearing
away a large part of his head.
The young man had been a close student
at the University of Wisconsin, Madison,
taking the law course with every promise
of graduating with honors, when he in
tended to go to Columbia University.
He was compelled to leave college two
weeks ago under medical orders on ac
count of severe blinding pains in his head
and weak eyes. Since returning home he
has been confined to his room and ap
peared despondent as well as in bad
physical health. To these causes hia un
timely end is attributed.
His mother went to his room at 7:30 this
morning and asked if he wanted anything
and how he felt. He replied that he felt
better and wanted nothing to eat. At 11
o'clock Mrs. Hughett returned to her sou's
room and repeated her solicitous inquiry,
but he refused to eat. Shortly after 1
o'clock every member of the household
present was startled by the noise of a
shot and ail rushed to William's room.
The door was locked and the coachman
forced it open, the family was horrified
to see the bleeding body of young Hughett
stretched on the floor, and life was ex
tinct. The revolver lay by his side, show
ing that the suicide bad arisen from bed
and locked the door, then put an end to
his mental and physical sufferings. The
police were notified by the family doctor,
and a brief inquest was held by Deputy Cor
oner O'Brien at the family residence. The
jury found that deceased had committed
suicide while temporarily insane.
The funeral services will be held next
Tuesday. The Hughett family consisted
of five children besides the parents, Mar
vin J. Hughett Jr. being assistant general
freight agent of the Northwestern Rail
road. Preside it Hughett is as well known
as any railroad president in the country,
and his wealth is estimated at $10,000,000.
The family is distracted with griet over
the sad occurrence.

OF THE SEALS.
Important Bill Before the

AIMS TO STOP POACHING.
Measures Considered for the Pro
tection Against Barbaric
Practices.
FAVORABLE REPORT EXPECTED.
Could Not Agree on a Subsidy for
a Cable to Hawaii and
Japan.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 15.â The
Benate Committee on Foreign Relations
has given a great deal of consideration to
the bill before it providing for the pro
tection of the fur-seal herds and the
best means of preventing pelagic sealing,
and stopping tlie brutal slaughter now
being carried on by Canadian sealers.
Ail the members of the committee were
present to-day except Mr. Morgan, and
owing to his absence final action was not
taken. The discussion disclosed the fact,
however, that the committee was in favor
of the bill, and would so report to the
Senate.
It is manifest to the committee that
Great Britain wili not consent to an
amendment of the regulations heretofore
agreed upon, and that nothing can be done
to prevent the slaughter that has been eo
ing on for years. "Without the assistance
of Great Britain in policing the waters of
the Northern Pacific, the committee be
lieves the United States will be unable to
prevent the following of indiscriminate
slaughter and ultimate total destruction of
the herd.
The only thing that remains to be done,
from the point of view of the committee,
is to end the trouble by wining out its
cause, unless Great Britain enters into
an arrangement with this Government that
will effectually stop illegal sealing and
protect the herds, instead of affording a
cloak under which to carry on flagrant
violations of the law.
The bill authorizes the President to
conclude negotiations with Great Britain,
Russia and Japan for the appointment of
a commission to investigate the present
condition of the seal herds, the present
metnods of slaughtering them, and to con
sider what further regulations are neces
sary for its preservation.
The committee also discussed the various
bills before it providing for the construc
tion of a telegraphic cable between this
country and Hawaii and Japan. The
judgment of the majority of the commit
tee is favorable to a proposition of this
character, but there has been no crystal!!
zation cf sentiment upon any particular
bill.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 15.-The
consideration of the agricultural appro
priation bill to-day gave opportunity for
the revival of the attacks upon Secretary
Morton of tne Agricultural Department,
begun by Senator Vest in the other branch
of Congress, for refusing to execute the
purpose of Congress to distribute seeds
among the farmers of the country. The
more bitter speeches were made by Demo
crats â Moses and Livingston of Georgia
and Boatner of Louisiana. Boatner and
Livingston included Comptroller Bowler
in their scathing denunciations, and in
sisted that the time had come when it was
necessary that the line between the legis
lative and executive departments of the
Government should be definitely and
finally settled. Livingston said that he
was willing that the legislative branch
eho uld be required to attend to its busi
ness and he wanted the executive branch
to learn to attend to its business.
When the House adjourned at 5 o'clock
the agricultural bill was pending.
Hill (K.) of lowa, chairman of the Com
mittee on Military Affairs, lilec the views
of the minority of the committee upon
the bill to place General Alexander Webb
on the retired list of the army.
ite amendments to the following
bills were agreed to:
Incorporating the Daughters of the Rev
olution; granting a year's absence to set
n the Yankton, Sioux and Sisseton
and Wahpeton reservations in South Da
authorizing the lease of university
- b< ol lands of Arizona.
On motion of Ray of New York
the Judiciary Committee's substitute
for Boatner's resolution regarding the re
fusal of Comptroller Bower to certify the
sugar bounty claims for payment was
passed. It reads:
(d, That the Committee on the Judi
ciary be and hereby is authorized and directed
.<_â¢ condition of the law sub
â¢ the right of the executive officers of the
Government in the several departments ]
: to refuse to enforce, execute or comply
w.;h the provision* of any aci of the Congress
United Mates on the ground of its al
leged uncoastitiiiionftlity or for other reasons,
end to report to the House by bill or otherwise.
Ray explained that the question was one
of great importance. If the power existed
certain executive officers might set at de
llance the laws of Congress approved by
the chief executive of che Nation. On
the other hand, it might be urged that the
power should rest with those officers to
stay, pending a judicial determination in
the courts, the execution of a law of Con
press prima facie valid and constitutional.
Recent discussion by those learned in the
law had disclosed a wide difference of
opinion as to what the law is or as to what
it ought to be. Without expressing any
opinion as to what the law was or as to
what it ought to be, the committee was of
the opinion that the condition of the law
upon this subject ought to be looked into
and that such investigation might suggest
proper legislation on the subject. The
committee did not deem it wise or proper
that the investigation should be directed
to any particular officer, act or depart
ment.
Terry (D.) of Arkansas said he was not
in sympathy with the uiterior object
sought to be secured by the resolution,
believing that an executive officer enforced
an unconstitutional law at his peril. How
ever, if the House thought the committee
thouid enter into an inquiry into the law
upon the subject he should not object.
After the passage of a few unimportant
billsMeCall (R.) of Tennessee, from the
Committee on Accounts, reported the reso
lation authorizing the Committee on Ways
and Means to investigate the workings of
reciprocity treaties.
In the form in which it was presented
the resolution met the objection of Crisp
(D.) of Georgia as not approved matter, a
proposition which Speaker, after some ar
gument, sustained. The resolution was
withdrawn.
Lacey (R.) of lowa called up the bill pre
pared in pursuance of the message of the
President requesting legislation to extend
the period within which suits may be
begun to annul land patents. By agree
ment the bill went over till the agricul
tural appropriation bill shall be disposed of.
(.rosvenor (R.) of Ohio presented the
petition of 8652 members of the G. A. R.
{â raying for a graded service pension law.
'i he House then went into committee of
the whole upon the agricultural appro
priations.
Willis (R.) of Delaware stated that the
biil carried a total appropriation of $3,158,
--192, which was $145,358 less than the total
of the bill for the current year.
"I believe," he said, "that the bill will
rueet your approval untjl you come to the
seed distribution paragraph, and that, I
have no doubt, you will be able to manage
to the satisfaction of men and angels."
Pickler (R.) of South Datota asked if
there was anything in the bill different
from that of the current year, intended to
compel ihe Secretary of Agriculture todis
tninite seed as desired by .Congress. Had
the committee any assurance that the Sec
retary who defied the law of 1895-96 would
Dot defy the law for 1896-97?
Wadsworth (It.) of Mew York, chairman
of the committee, said there was no change
in the law, and no such assurance as the
gentleman suggested had been given.
Baker (R.) of New Hampshire, whose
controversy last summer with Secretary
Morton over the refusal of the latter to dis
tribute seed in accordance with the appio
priation law nnd the intention and desire
of Congress was exploited at the time, ad
dressed the committee for half an hour.
He asserted that there* was absolutely
nothing in the opinion of the Attorney-
General, upon which the Secretary of Agri
culture said lie based liis action, to war
rant that official in refusing to execute the
law of Congress in the matter.
Moses (D.) of Georgia followed Baker in
denunciation of the course of the Secre
tary of Agriculture. He said it did not
make much difference what kind of an
appropriation was made if the will of the
House was not to be the law of the iand.
The danger to American institutions, ho
said, was not mat the representatives of
the people failed to carry out their will,
but that some other power, after the rep
resentatives of the people had expressed
the will of their constituencies, nullified
that expression by neglecting or refusing
to carry out the law.
Boatner (D.) of Louisiana was the next
to attack the Secretary. His manner ex
pressed the deep indignation which he
j said he felt over the fact that the refusal
of the Secretary of Agriculture to expend
the seed appropriation made by the last
Congress was based upon a sort of false
pretense.
"Antecedent to his decision that under
the terms of the law he was not author
ized to expend the appropriation," said
Boatner, "there emanated from the Agri
cultural Department reports derogatory
and discrediting to the Congress of the
United States. The individual who has
found his way into the Agricultural -De
partment under this administration (laugh
ter) considered it not inconsistent with the
dignity of his position to allow reports to
go out through the press, scattered broad
cast through the Union, that he had dis
cover, d great frauds and abuses in the
distribution by members of the seeds al
lotted to them under existing laws. I do
not know whether these statements were
true or false, but I do know and T assert
that the publication of any such scandalous
charges against a body of gentlemen with
out the designation of the names of the
individuals who 1 ad been found so small
and so corrupt and so unfit for the posi
tions that they occupied was not only an
insult to the Congress of the United States,
but a cowardly attack that was inconsist
j ent with the dignity of any man who occu
j pied a cabinet position. [Applause.] It
i seems to me, Mr. Chairman, however
small and obscure any individual might
be, if by chance under executive favor
he was raised to the high position of a
cabinet officer the mere fact of his eleva
tion ought to raise him above any such
contemptible and cowardly littleness.
[Applause.] For one, as a member of the
Fifty-third Congress, I resent and de
nounce as an infamous slander the asser
tion that that body as a body, or the
preceding Congress of which I was a mem
ber, were addicted to the sale of seeds
which were allotted to them for distribu
tion among their constituents."
Ray (R.) of New York said: "Does not
the gentleman know the fact that the hard
heart of the Secretary of Agriculture has
relented, and that out of the abundance of
his heart â and of the appropriation â he is
about to make the most generous distribu
tion? I received a letter this week from
the Secretary of Agriculture announcing
10 me that he had complied with the law;
tl.at he had made an apportionment under
the appropriation act of seeds, plants and
bulbs, and that the pro rata coming to me
for my district of liW.OOO people would
be fifteen grape seeds and twenty-five
strawberry plants." [Laughter.]
Boatner â Justice to the Secretary of
Agriculture requires that that admission
should be made. 1 received a similar let
ter, advising me that there were forty
grape cuttings and 1(30 strawberry plants
at my disposal for distribution in my dis
trict. I supposed the Secretary had
found some rare kind of grapes. The
refusal by the Secretary of Agri
culture to execute the law to
expend the appropriation was in deliberate
contempt of the authority of the Congress
of the United States. I so construed it;
and for one, as a member of Congress, I am
tiredâ l am absolutely tired â of having
this body brought into discredit and its
authority despised by a mere executive
officer. Why, it has sot down to that
point that a mere subordinate, a man who
is Known as Comptroller of the Treasury
(laughter) declares an act of Congress un
constitutional, and refuses his royal assent
to its execution. (Laughter and applause.)
It has come to that point that a second
veto power has been discovered â that while
Congress may pass a law which, if the
President veto, it would be passed over his
veto, that a clerk in the Treasury Depart
ment (snapping his fingers) may turn it
down, to that the parties who are inter
ested have to go to the courts and show
thatttiis law is constitutional. I repeat
that this refusal on the part of the Secre
tary of Agriculture to expend tnis appro
priation is in contempt of the authority of
this body ; that it is one of the very small
est economies, and that it takes away from
a large class of our people the only thing
which connects them with the Govern
ment. (Applause.)
Livingston (D.) of Georgia followed in
the same line, but first criticized the Com
missioner of Agriculture, whom he said
the House and the country would hold re
sponsible for the conduct of the Depart
ment of Agriculture. Referring to the
construction of the bill, he said:
"You come back into this House witi:
the same verbiage in your bill us ambigu
ous as Mr. Morton or anybody else would
like to have it. I have no excuse to offer
for Mr. Morton, and I want it distinctly
understood that he has gone a long way
and certainly stretched his conscience and
stretched the constitution and the law a
great deal more when he refused to expend
that money as the Plouse directed."
Ray (R.)*of New Yorkâ After March 4.
1897, we propose to have a Republican Sec
retary of Agriculture, who will carry out
the law as written on the statute book 9.
Livingstonâ Well, let the gentleman take
heed that his party does have such a
Secretary. Put a man there who knows
how to clean the mud off hia own boots, j
how to manage a farm, how to work a
farm â and not B. politician, a man who
goes over the country singing either gold
bugism or silverisin. [Applause.] Give
us a man who is not a scientific man, but a
practical man; above all, a man who is in
touch with the people who draw a line
over a mule and plow from Monday morn
ing until Saturday noon, and then unhitch
tno mule, put a saddle on top of him and
rile ten miles to get their mail. When
such a man receives a few papers of seeds
through the mail he goes home rejoicing
In the fact, saying to himself, "I am a citi
zen of a great country and 1 am not for
gotten, though ever so humble."
In conclusion Livingston said: "Mr.
Chairman, I want to see this committee
take hold of this bill and change and
amend it as it ought to be changed and
amended, so that in the first place it will
add to the business for whicn it was
created, and not be for the benefit of the
politicians, but of all the people who farm
the land and till the soil. In the second
place, I want to see it take the bill and
amend it so that the servants â and Morton
is nothing but a servant, and I want him
to understand that I said it â to see that
our servant, the Secretary of Aciiculture,
obeys the will of the House, or we will im
peach him or do worse. [Applause.]
"Now tliis country has just about got to
this point: There are three branches of
the Government and I am perfectly will
ing to see that the legislative department
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1896.
attends to its own business, but, so help
me God, I am determined that the other
departments of the Government shall at
tend to their own business and let us
alone. [Applause.] And we will draw
the line and have it distinctly understood
that this is a republican form of govern
ment and is not under the control of a
Comptroller of the Treasury or of the Secre
tary of Agriculture, and that they cannot
undertake to construe laws made by the
House of Representatives." [Applause.]
At the conclusion o! Livingston's re
marks, which closed general debate on the

PLOWMAKERS WIN OUT.
McÃride Loses the Suit to Pre
vent Infringements on
His Patent.
Decision Rendered in One of the Most
Important Cases Ever Tried
in lowa.
DES MOINES, lowa, Feb. 15.-In the
Federal Court to-day Judge John S. Wool
son decided one of the most important
cases ever tried in lowa. It is the suit of
John McÃride vs. Kingman & Co. et al.
McÃride was the first patentee of a riding
plow and he sued all the important con
cerns in the country which are manufac
turing the plows for infringement. Among
the leading defendants are Kingman & Co.
and E. M. Galbraith of Peoria, the Weir
Plow Company, H. H. Sickles & Co., the
John Deere Plow Company, the Moline
Plow Company, James Ainsworth, John
S. Bonbright, George W. Randall, Adam
Dickey and the Norwegian Plow Com
pany.
The trial was held here last fall and ex
pert patent attorneys from all over the
country were engaged for ten days in it.
Samples of every riding plow made in
the country were exhibited in the court
room to prove that their essential features
were copied after the idea patented by Mc-
Bride.
The court holds for the defendants on
the ground that the ideas of McÃride were
crude and undeveloped, while those used
by the defendants are vastly improved and
more practical. McÃride especially claims
to have invented the flexible axle by
which the plowshare could be raised and
lowered by the operator without leaving
his seat. The court holds that the idea as
patented was not practicable, and could
not have been used.
McÃride aslJed heavy damages for the
infringements, and is overruled. The case
will be appealed to the court of last re
sort.
AX EXFLOSIOy OF GASOLIXjE.
Sleeping- Cars liatntiged by the Carelets-
ness of Cleaner*.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Feb. 15.â A violent
explosion of gasoline took place at 11:45
to-day in the sleeping-car Wyndham in
the yards of the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company, near Union station. There
were no >assengers in the car at the time,
it being in th-e hands of the cleaners. Two
women, Mrs. Foss and Miss Conroy, and
the car porter were at work at the time.
The women were cleaning the carpet of
the car and were using gasoline for the
purpose. In some way the gasoline be
came ignited and the explosion followed.
The three occupants were hurled the
length of the car and were unconscious
when found. They were all badly hurt.
The car itself was badly damaged. In
front it is almost a wreck above the trucks.
The sides were bulged out and the roof
lifted. Every window was shattered and
the doors were blown from their hinges.
The sleeping-cars Zita and New Eng
land, which were standing on either side
of the Wyndham, were both badly dam
aged.
RIVER AJSJ) U ARBOR WORK.
Sleeting of the Californiana Sent to the
Xntional Capital.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 15.â The
committee-room of Representative Loud
was the scene this morning of an enthus
iastic meeting of more than a dozen Cali
fornians. All the members of the Cali
fornia delegation in Congress, including
the two Senators, were present, as were
also H. J. Corcoran of Stockton, William
Johnson of Courtland, Dr. J. T. McLean
of Alameda, E. McGettigan of Vallejo, W.
T. Colter of San Jose and Mr. Greaves of
Redding.
The six gentlemen named are the dele
gates selected at a convention called in
California in December to seek Govern
mental aid in improving the Sacramento
and San Joaquin Rivers and their tribu
taries, as well as the harbors of San
Francisco, Oakland and Vallejo. It is the
intention, if possible, to secure appropria
tions for building jetties and dredging the
rivers and to improve the harbors on the
plans designed by the United States en
gineers.
The meeting this morning was called to
talk over the situation and to arrange a
programme which will be followed when a
hearing is given to the Californians by the
River and Harbor Committee of the
House.
AFTBR WAMOXD SMUGGLERS.
Customs Officers Arrest Herman Krck
Upon Arrival.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 15.-When the
North German Lloyd steamship Aller
drew up to her dock in Hoboken last
night there were almost as many special
United States customs officers waiting for
her as there were passengers in her first
cabin.
They arrested Herman Keck of the Cos
ternians-Henreichs-Keck Diamond Cut
ting Company of Cincinnati, who was sus
pected of smuggling diamonds, and also a
Cincinnati lawyer named Jones, who met
and spoke to Keck, but notning could be
found about either man of a suspicious
character, so they were released. The
search was made on account of the seizure
of $20,000 worth of diamonds in the posses
sion of the captain of the Rhynland at
Philadelphia several days ago.
Marines Sent to Seoul.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 15.âNoth
ing has been heard at the State Depart
ment about the condition of affairs at
Seoul, Korea. The report from Yokohama
that United States marines have been
sent to Seoul has not been confirmed to
the Navy Department. The gunboat Ma
chias is at Clemulpo, the nort of Seoul,
and marines sent to the Korean capital
would come from that vessel.
Soh Kwanq Pom, the new Korean Min
ister, arrived in Washington this after
noon.
Purchased for Mrs. Sprague.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 15.â The
property known as Edgewood, the Wash
ington home for many years of the late
Chief Justice Chase, has been purchased
by subscriptions among the friend| of Mrs.
Kate Chase Sprague, who intend to hold it
in trust for her, and upon opportunity for
its sale, to present the proceeds to admin
istrators for Mrs. Sprague's use. At public
sale a year ago the property brought
$46,954, which was only the amount of
mortgage upon it.

On Saturday, the 22d, it will

the first time an opportunity of '.

We have won a place in the
people's hearts, we have wound
ourselves around the people's
hearts, we have their good will
to such an extent that there's
only one place in all Frisco and
that's the big store. They have
been treated right ; they have
rewarded us with their patron-
age, and we will continue to
merit it ; notwithstanding that
our competitors, when we open-
ed, only gave us six months.
They have proven themselves
enemies to you in the commer-
cial way, for they have tried to
satisfy their own end ; tried to
drive out other competitors by
calling San Francisco, in New
York City, a "jay town" to open
a big store in, and you don't
have to go far from our store to
find the man that uttered it.
But San Francisco ain't a "jay
town" when it has supported
such a big institution as your
big and favorite house, run by
the Frisco boys, on Kearny
street.
We're awfully thankful to you,
and as this is anniversary week
with us, we'll show our thanks
to you in a very substantial way.

FRISCO'S BIGGEST ANI6
MOST POPULAR STORE.
To show fully our apprecia-
tion of the large patronage given
the big store we have concluded
to continue our $9 Sale and
change its name from Challenge
to an Anniversary Sale.
It is a challenge because there
are no other houses in San Fran-
cisco that will produce like Suits,
like Overcoats, like garments,
as high in character, as new in
style, under $18.
In the picture above we show
an awfully clever Cutaway ; tai-
lors can't make a handsomer
garment. We show it in Black
Clay Worsteds, in fine Gray
Clay Worsteds and small, neat
figured effects ; also in fine Blue
and Black Cheviots. The same
in Single-Breasted Sacks ; the
same in Double -Breasted Sacks,
high-class tailor-made garments.
Anniversary Week price,
-$9.00â
While we state it will be An-
niversary Week price, we do not
guarantee to be able to show a
large assortment other than that
from day to day, as the big store
has been crowded ever since it
inaugurated the Challenge Sale,
and we deem it our duty to show
you our appreciation of the trade
given us in the last four years,
so therefore, would advise of
you to call early.

SANTA ROSA. Cal., Feb. 15.-The 80
--noma County Grund Jury's report to
Superior Judgo Crawford this morning
was not nearly as sensational a document
as m my expected. It was rather a
Mrairhtiorward utterance,, liowcver, and
unpleasant enough for several county 011 -
Oials niul employes. Jndge Crawford, in
dismissing the jurors, remarked that if
every Inquisitorial body did its duty as
thoroughly "things would iÂ»- better." No
true bills were found, the Grand Jury con
tentins itself with reporting a shortugo in
county funds ot over $13,000 ami remark
ing that "indiottrients at ttie present time
will be an injudicious way to proceed for
tho recovery oi the moneys due the county."
One ol the amounts is now being sued for
In tho Superior Court and the other is in
the bands of the Supervisors.
The jury found that the shortage in cx-
Trcasurur Btofen's ollico, due to the "real
or pretended robbery," was $8000, and tho
shortage in Recorder Hall's offioe was
16000.
It was recommended that hereafter no

gambler, better known as the "Missouri
Kid." The men had been drinking
together, and becoming intoxicated, a dis-
OUSaion arose and terminated in n light.
Welch left the saloon in search of a pis
tol, but failing to procure one returned
with Â» rock and started for his adversary.
Tho bnrtendor und a young man named
Maloney attempted to interfere, but Welch
evaded them und made a rush at Johnson,
who immediately opened Jire with his re
volver. He fired four shots and each bul
let took effect.
One entered under the left arm, another
entered back of the left shoulder, the third
struck Welch in the center of the breast,
hut glanosd from a riband passed through
Maioney's arm while Maloi'.ey was en
deavoring to separate the men. The last
bullet found a lodgment in Welch's right
shoulder.
The wounded man walked from the
place of the shooting in tho saloon to
a room in the rear, where he fell. Ho was
conveyed to the Receiving Hospital and

physicians have but small hope that he
will survive his wounds.

CLEVER WORK ON THE STAGE.
The Benefit for the Fresno Club a
Great Successâ An Attractive
Parade.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 15.â The significant
leeend "standing-room only" greeted the
astonished gaze of the late arrivals at the
Barton Opera-house to-night. The min
strel and athletic company of the Olympic
Club of San Francisco was the attraction
on the inside.
During the day the freedom of the city
was not only extended to the visitors, but
every consideration calculated to make
them feel welcome and at home was looked
after.
The reception and parade this afternoon
was an attractive affair. It was partici
pated in by about 100 members of the
Fresno Athletic Club and sixty from Corn
panics 0 and F, Sixth Regiment. N. G. C,
fully equipped and uniformed and headed
by Justy's band. The line of march was
through the principal streets of the city.
The entertainment to-nigut was a bonefit
to the Fresno Athletic Club by the
Olympics. Those on the reception
committee from the local athletes were:
R. M. Thompson, J. Reichman. \V. 1).
Coates, H. Sherwood, William Glass, E.
A. Donahoo, F. G. Berry and 11. Chamber
lin.
In the cast of the minstrel aggregation
were: Sloan, Van Bendeleben, J. Catch
cart, O'Brion, Hallett, Hxcling, Cook,
Toohig, MeNally, Stegeman, Rathburn,
Starkey, Carter, C. Cathcart, Griffith,
Morrell, Butz, Mitchell, Swinnerton,
Charles T. Kreling, Fred A. Britten,
Joseph F. Coffey, James W. Coffrotn,
Chase, Comey, T. Jennings Jr., K. Wat
son. J. J. Cathcart, Short, Kennedy, Ros

The local hits by the members of the
company and the cartoons of Swinnerton
were rich. Alexander Rosborough, like
O. W, Holmes, did not dare to be as fanny
as he could. Every specialist acquitted
himself with great credit. Some of
Fresno'* most prominent and wealthy
citizens occupied seats in the parquet,
dress circle and boxes.
The boys leave for home to-nieht, carry
ing the best wishes of many iriends and

estate and msnrance agent of this city,
against the Sun Insurance Company of
London, J. \V. Landers, its areneral agent,
and K. W. Dv Bois, a special agent, is
being hotly contested here. The ablest
legal talent is employed in the case.
Doolittle formerly "represented the Sun

says General Agent Landers of San Fran
cisco, and was given notice to pay up.
About this time Doolittle visited San
Francisco, where on a warrant sworn out
by Special Agent Dv Bois he was ar
rested on â  enarga of embezzlement for
retaining |M 0 of the company's money.
He was brought here under arrest by
Sheriff Scott. Dooltttle made good the
shortage, and the action against him was
dismissed. He then brought the damaee
suit.
Doolittle was on the stand most all day,
and his examination was not ended when
the court took a recess until Monday.

TACOMA.XS Gim UP HOPE.
Believe That Mr*. Cody Will Xot Be Found
Among tho Living.
TACOMA, Wash.. Feb. 15. âNo more
Bysteruatic search for a missing person was
ever inaugurated in the West than that for
Mrs. A. B. Cody, largely through the ef
forts of the Chicago police department.
Every Chief of Police in the United States
has been notified and supplied with de
scriptions of the missing woman. Fifty
four division superintendents of railroads
running from Pacific Coast points have
each received a personal letter from prom -
inent railroad men, friends of the family,
with a large number of circulars and pic
tures. The extent of the inquiry i 3 learned
when it is stated that telegraphic clews
from all parts of the country are almost
hourly received, invariably reporting in
vestigations that have ended ?n nothing.
With these hundreds of persons assisting
in the search, absolutely nothing has been
accomplished, and Mrs. Cody's relatives
are in despair. Fvery clew that has been
traced has proved an" erroneous one, and
Tacomana are almost ready to admit that
the unfortunate woman will not be found
among the living.

to Capitola.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal.. Feb. 15.â Fish
Commissioners W. C. Murdoek an<i H. E.
Emeric came down this evening to get a
chance at tbe big fishing. They said the
newspaper reports had seemed like exag
gerations to most sportsmen; and for that
reasoa many of them declined to come j
here.
The Santa Cruz people would welcome
all the visitors who care to come here, but
they do not like to be charged with send
ing out false reports. The correspondents
have obtained tueir information from the
tishermen and by inspecting the wharf
when the bo3ts come in. The catch to-day
numbered between iSO and 500, and many
of them were handsome specimens, weigh
ing from twenty to forty pounds.
Dr. W. P. Chalmers, Quarantine Officer
of San Francisco, brought in a forty.
pounder of which he was justly proud.
! His catch was large and varied in weight
I from that of the big fellow to the small
i ones of three or four pounds. Isidor
Jacobs also made a reputation as an angler, j
A party of thrte â J. Scrivner, Judge C. ;
F. Monteakgre of San Francisco ami Cap
tain C. H. K. Fitzgerald of New York
took twenty salmon for the day's sport.
One weighed forty pounds and three j
others thirty-five, thirty and twenty-nine
pounds respectively. "Salmon weighing !
above thirty pounds were numerous in the
catches by the local fishermen.
Trolling has been the favorite method
to-day, and it was by that method the
heaviest fish were taken. The smaller ones
remain nearer th<? bottom of the bay. Big
preparations are being made for to-mor
row's sport.
The whaie that was killed yesterday rose
I to the surface this mor:i:iig and was towed

CRIME OF FOUR MEXICANS.

at Large.
SAX DIEGO, Cal., Feb. 15.â The mys
tery veiling tne murder of an Italian \
miner named Potesti, whose body was j
found in the dry bed of Pichacho Creek on \
January 22, has been cleared by the con- j
fessior. of two of the four Mexicans who i
did away with him.
Potesti was a hard-working placer ininer,
and he saved quite a turn in gold dustâ j
about $700. He worked Jast at the Picha
cao placers, southwest of Jacumba, on the
desert Several months ago one Onofre j
Lloya. a miner, saw Potesti at the laiter's I
camp at Pichacho. and the Italian asked j
Lloya to stay with him, as he was afraid of i
trouble. He did not go into particulars, j
end Lloya did not stay, being on his way
to the Cocopab Mountains. A month ]
later Lloya returned and found that Po- !
testi had gone. The latter had said that j
he would probably go to Los Angeles to
buy an improved dry-washer to handle a
lot of pay dirt.
From the signs around the deserted
camp Lloya believed that Indians had j
been there, and when Joe Garcia and A. }
D. Ray brought the news of the finding of
Potesti's body in the creek bed, Lloya was
convinced that Indians had done the
killing. Garcia said there were imprints
of naked feet around ihe body and other
rinta leading down the canyon. The '
of the dead man's face had been eaten !
off by I irds and one eye was gone, so that
k \va< impossible to tell whether he had j
-not through the head or not. but
there was a terrible wound over the raiss- i
. which appeared to have been the
canse of death.
There was no sign of a struggle, and :
Poteeti must have been killed instantly. !
lie had worn r miner's belt containing j
>ld dust under his ordinary belt.
The gold belt was gone and the other was
shoved up under his arms. Nothing -was
found in the pockets, but a description of
the body showed clearly enough to Po- j
testi's friends that he was tne victim.
Nothing was Hone by the authorities, as it
was below the boundary line and in a very
isolated place.
The murder might have been completely j
forgotten and entirely unavenged ii one of j
the murderers had not become drunk at j
Juarez mining camp. This man, Kpifanio
Gallesros, appeared at Juarez last week
with a lot of tools, which were afterward
found to be the property of Potesti. He
sold them and began imbibing liquor, and
while intoxicated displayed a Jot of money
and gold dust. He became so boisterous
that a Justice of the Peace ordered him
under arrest, and a rurale put him in the
corral that serves for a jail at Juarez.
After Gallegos became sober lie was de
spondent, and received the impression j
that he had been arrested on the charge of
murdering the Italian, Potesti. He was
violent for a time, and finally broke down
and confessed that he was one of the
murderers of the miner. He said his
brother, two of Duke's Mexican cowboys
end a ronng Mexican named Ignacio Sor
tello tiad done the deed. He said one of
tiie men was in Lower California, and that
the others had disappeared.
The authorities sent out a force of
rurales and the other Mexican was cap
tured and charged with murder. "When
he found that Gallegos had told the story
he also confessed and named other ac
complices. These prisoners told how they
became possessed of the knowledge that
Potesti had $700 in gold dust, which he
continually carried in a belt. They said
they got their information from Victor
Pinto, the outlaw, and the authorities of
Lower California are now searcuing for
that picturesque gentleman, who has a
record full of crime and daredevil deeds.
The four Mexicans agreed among them
eelves to follow Potesti until he reached
some lonesome and isolated spot, where
they would kill him. The men kept a
close watch of the Italian, and he filially
left his camp on foot to come to San Diego
by way of Campo. He left in the night,
preferring to escape the heat of the desert.
The watcher for the pang notified his part
ners and the four followed Potesti as far
as Picacho Creek. When they saw him
pafely in the trail leading up the creek
two of the men made a wide detour and
reached the head of the arroyo ahead of
their victim, so as to meet him. The
other two gradually came up with him.
At a place hidden by low sandhills the
unsuspecting miner met the two Mexi
cans. One of these stopped him, and the
ether, springing forward, placed a pistol
at his head and fired. Potesti fell in his
tracics without a struggle, and ihe two
murderers were joined by the other two,
and they robbed the body of the belt of I
Fold. Gallegos said there was $700 in gold
dust in it.
The four were on the verge of a fight in
the division of the spoils, but finally
ejrreed, Gallegos taking a little less gold
anl agreeing to take Potesti's tools and
camp outfit for the balance. Gallegos told
how he and the others ahcussecr the best
method of diverting suspicion, and how
they decided to take off tbeir shoes and
leave their naked footprints in the sand
around the body and for a mile or so down
the creekbed in order to lead the discover
ers of the body to believe the Indians had
flone the deed. They thought best not to
bury the body as the coyotes would dig
it up again, while if it were loft just as
it lay it would noon be rendered unrecog
nizable. The four men separated before
daylight and have remained apart. A
Eearch of that country convinced the offi
cers that two of the men have escaped into
thla State.
The two in custody will be tried for mur
der at Ensenada, and as they have con
fessed their participation in the crime and
division of toe money it is probable that
they will be stood up against an adobe
wall and shot.
The name of the second man arrested is
; r.ot yet known, but he is believed to be
j lgnacio Sortello. This man has been a
I constant trouble to Jjoth Mexican and
I American officers. It was he and Epifanio
â  Gallegos who were captured by Customs
| Officer Conklin some months ago for
| cattle-steaiing. Conklin foolishly started
. for San Diego with both the desperadoes
j unshackled, one riding on the seat with
: him and the other behind him. When an
j isolated place was reached the man behind
j Conklin struck him over the head and
stunned him and the two beat him and
threw him down into the canyon beside
the road, believing him to be dead. They
cut the horses loose and made good their
j escape. Since that time feortello has been
| in several scrapes below the line.
E STER TA IX ED A T Til VCKEE.
Excursionists Partake of the Pleasures
of the Carnival.
TRUCKEE, Cal., Feb. 15.â One carload
of excursionists was sidetracked this
morning from overland train 3, and about
fifty visitors came down in an excursion
from Reno. At 10 o'clock a special train
was run out to Dormer Creek bridge, at
which point sleighs were in waiting to
take visitors to Lake Tahoe. Sleighing is
good from that point.
A large number of school-children went
up to Tatioe on the excursion and enjoyed
the treat immensely. Those who remained
in town repaired to the skating-rink and
to the ice on Henrys pond. The toboggan
slide drew the attention of the sightseers,
and many shot down the icy chute.
To-night the excursionists are taking in
the sights of the carnival, and Truckee is
doing herself proud in entertaining them.
Many of the excursionists from Reno were
cadets from the university and attended in
uniform. A large excursion is expected
to-morrow, and the same plan of entertain
ment has been mapped out.
MILL VALLEY'S RECLUSE.
George F. Marsh Will Close His
Quaint Japanese Home
and Leave.
Dreds the Disturbing Hum of Elec
tricity That Will Come With
the Scenic Railway.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., Feb. 15.â George
F. Marsh, whoae Japanese home in Mill
Valley has been the admiration of visitor,
says he will sell out and leave because the
Mill Valley and Mount TamalDais Scenic
U;iiiroad runs by his place. Mr. Marsh
does not like the buzz of electricity or the
clang of discordant bells, and the building
of the mountain road has transformed
his place from a sequestered country spot
into ft scene o! bustle and confusion.
Marsh is a dealer in Japanese articles
and has a great fancy for them, and it was
for this reason he spent thousands of dol
lars in fixing up his property with unique
creations from the skilled hands of the
Japanese. His declaration that he intends
; to dispose of his home and leave Mill Val
; ley has caused a great deal of surprise and
i repret.
When Marsh purchased the property he
now occupies, on Corte Madera avenue, he
believed that he had secured a place far
away from the noise and confusion of the
i town, where he would not }><â¢ bothered by
i Sunday revelers or lorn, . oiced pic
nickers.
After he purchased the secluded prop
erty he sent to Japan for a number of I
skilled workmen, and when they ar
rived put them at work building houses
i and fences after the style of the homes
| they had left in the Orient. Large in
voices of bamboo and other Japanese
articles arrived in Mill Valley and were
carted away far up the Cor te Madera
l Canyon to the Marah property, where
the skilled Japs erected artistic fences
and built houses without the use
of nails â in fact, everything was as it is in
Japan. Even the small creek running
through the place was transformed by the
; Mikado's subjects, and peculiar little
; waterfalls and bridges were built to greet
i the eve of the visitor.
Marsh expended a great deal of money
on his Mill Valley home and it was one of
the interesting and objective points of the
valley, and one never thought of overlook
ing Marsh's place when showing a visitor
the sights.
UJflOyS MUItDER TRIAL.
Flimsy Jiefente of the Alleged Slayer of
the Mnche Family.
UNION, Or., Feb., 15.â The trial of
Kelsay Porter for the murder of the Mache
family in Pine Valley on New Year's night
is dragging slowly alone. A strong effort
is being made to save the defendant's life,
if not his liberty. The courtroom is
densely packed from morning until mid
night.
An attempt was made to-day to prove
that there had been a conspiracy between
the Maches and Lockwood, a character
known as "Six Shooter," to kill Porter.
Porter went on the stand this afternoon
in his own defense. He explained in de
tail all the particulars of the affair, up to
the time of the shooting and killing of
young Mache, claiming that Mache began
shooting at him first, but he did not ac
count for the killing of the old couple,
claiming it must have been accidental.
His defense up to now is not a very strong
one, and in many communities it would
not be accepted as a defense at all. It is
claimed, though, that Porter's lawyers
will spring a surprise when they introduce
rebuttal testimony.
The killing of the Mache family is not a
local sensation, but it has aroused indig
nation of the whole State. In the past few
3'ears so many murd-rs have bet-n com
mitted in this locality, and the perpetra
tors al-lowed to go free, that the respecta
ble people are resolved to put an end. to
the carnival of blood. They are deter
mined to make an example of Porter, if
found guilty as charged.

Patrick as his attorney, the latter agreeing j
to see him through for the amount of
money he had in the bank and $50 extra.

More people have talked of California in
East Portland during the past week than

A TALK ON ECONOMY.
California, the Executive Says,
Has Too Many Insane
Asylums.
GUARDING THE STATE FUNDS.
His Reason for Vetoing the District
Fair Appropriation Bill Is Ex
plained.
STOCKTON, Cai,., Feb. 15.â Governor
Budd was present to-day at a .meeting of
the directors and members of the San
Joaquin Valley Fair. Association, and in
tiie course of his indirect comments on
President Shippee's statement, alleged to
be derogatory to his official treatment of
the district associations, he made some in
teresting statements in regard to his ideas
of economy. In regard to the veto of the
fair appropriation bill, the Governor said
that a number of the Senators who came
to him to urge it's passage had counted
upon li is being favorable to aiding the
dist-riat fairs out of the State treasiiry, in
asmuch as he was on a note for $6000 with,
other directory of "the association.
He said that the brag had been made
that they could bring an influence to bear
upon him which would force him to sign
the bill.
"When I heard that," said the Governor,
"I cussed."
The Governor believed that the people
were taxed to death Jast year and he was
determined to stand by his promises of an
economical administration. Ii it had not
been that he believed that it would entail
considerable hardship upon some of the
inmates, he said, he would have vetoed
the appropriations for two of the State in
sane asylums, as the present system is en
tirely unnecessary.
Further, the Governor said that he
would be in favor of consolidating San
Quentin wilh Folsom. closing the former
institution, as under one management the
criminals would be cared for at a far less
expense to the State.
When asked why he approved the bill
granting aid to the State fair, he said that
that institution seemed to stand in great
picture of their handsome daughter, Mar
garette Scnnider, as a testimony to the good
of this great remedy.
East Portland, Oregon, boasts of one of
the prettiest Margarette in the land. This
sweet little girl is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. H. Schnider of 282 Crosby street, East
Portland, Oregon. As you see her in the
above picture you see her in the flesh.
Her cheeks are plump, her eyes bright,
and there is color in her face. There is
not a mark, a blot or a blemish to spoil
the beautiful contour of the face. The
reason is given that she has been using
Joy's Vegetable Sarsapari^a. Margarette
sends her love to California and tells of
need of temporary aid, and that, as a State
fair, it was a State institution.
He said that he considered that he had
saved the State $196,000 by his record, and
he would continue to veto all bills which
he considered a grab into the public
treasuty.
After some discussion among the direct
ors and members of the association a com
mittee of twenty was appointed to devise
ways and means for raising the debt and
continuing the fair without State aid.
President Shippee did not attempt to re
fute any of the Governor's statements, but
stated privately that they would refute
themselves.

"TEAHIj RIVEKS" DEAD.
She Otcned and Controlled the -Â»iÂ» Or
leans flcnyuiie.
NEW ORLEANS, La., Feb. 15.-Mrs.
George Nicholson, proprietor of the New
Orleans Picayune, died to-day. She was
best known as "Pearl Rivers," a Writer of
recognized ability. â¢
She was the only woman in the world who
owned and controlled a big morning news
paper. Her husband, who was managing
editor of the Picayune, died last week, and
it is thought that worry over his demise,
together with a severe cold contracted two
days ago, caused her death. She was
about GO years of age.

Margarette is winsome, bright, and is
easily the prettiest Margarette in the coun

business is at 33 Fourth st., Portland. He
came out of his offices especially to tell me
of the great good Joy's Vegetable Sarsapa
rilla had done for the family. "It is,"
said he, "the family medicine now, and
we propose always to keep this remedy in
the house." He advised me to visit many
other houses in Portland and I would
learn of wonderful things that had been
done by Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. He
said he knew of a case of scrofula that was

DEFAZCATIOX ASD DEATH.
Failed, in Buxinrss, Ruined His Father
and Jiobbed His Town.
EPPING, N. H., Feb. 15.â Two weeks
ago this village was thrown into a.commo
tion by the announcement that State Sen
ator Charles E. Folsom, who manufactured
box shooks, had failed for $30,000 and that
his aged father was ruined by indorsing
his son's paper. For the past fifteen years
Mr. Folsom has been chairman of the
Board of Selectmen, and soon after the
failure ugly rumors began to tje circulated
that he had misappropriated some of the
town's money to tide him over.
Within the past twenty- four hours the
excitement attending thefailure has been
greatly increased by the death of Senator
Folsom at an early hour this morning,
and the additional report that he was not
only a defaulter to the extent of $12,000
and more, but had also been a forger on
several occasions to hide his stealings.
Folsom was a man in whom every one re
posed the highest confidence ' and his
habits were of the best.

By the way, a remarkable thing in Port

FATHER YORKE TO
B. F. HUDELSON.
The Chancellor Discusses
the Principles of the
A. P. A.
FOBGERY IS CHARGED.
Bogus Instructions to Catholics
Said to Have Been Cir
culated.
"A MYTHICAL ENCYCLICAL."
The Priest Declares That It Was
Compiled by the Enemies of the
Catholic Church.
Writing in answer to a letter of B. F.
Hudelson the Rev. P. C. Yorke says:.
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: The Rev.
Benjamin liudelson. State president of the
A. I. A., shows small respect for the order o!
Which he has constituted himself the ehnm
pion. In his last letter he "established 1 ' a rub
bish heap ftnd proceeded to pitch into it that
patriotic society, the A. P. A. Of course, I hnve
not the slightest desire to quarrel with the
Key. Mr. Iluaelson's sense of the eternal fitness
of things. Ho may not know more about the
A. P. A. thÃn I do, but he knows nearly as
much. His judgment, therefore, is not warped
by lack of information, and when he considers
his organization as rubbisn for the garbage
wagon I merely rise to second his motion.
But, Mr. Editor, 1 venture to disagree with
the Key. Benjamin Uudelsou when he inti
mates that we should close our eyes and our
noses to the resting-place of his society. He
prefers that we should review instead the
platoons of ponderous platitudes â which he
parades before your readers. But I think you
will agree with me that the subject under con
sideration now is not a hotch-potch of truisms,
but the nature of the A. P. A. Though its
friends would consign that society to the rub
bish heap, we must kot forego our right to the
legal formality of an inquest. 'With careful
compression of the nostriis and a liberal use of
disinfectants we may at the end ot a very long
pole investigate this organization, -which its
own champions seem anxious to consign to
oblivion with -burial of a dog.
The Rev. Benjamin Hudelson has â¢vouch
safed no explanation of his anxiety to.engage
in this controversy. He has not told us how
he is free to violate the solemn oath of the
ritual: "I will not enter into any controversy
with a Roman Catholic upon the subject of
this order. ' Is there one law for the master
ft her for the man, or is the Rev. Benia-
I : . Hudelson merely engaged in that pru
dent operation known as mendinp his fences?
Next month his term of office eomCs to an end,
a:;d already there are other condldates sniff
ing for tne salary. I wonder does h-e imagine
that his fellow patriots who are tired of the
ministerial monopoly of the official hogwash
will be placated t>y his annihilation of the
Papacy in print.
The unfortunate lay members of the order
fry they are sice of "Christian Patriotism."
Many of them are looking with hope to the
ides of March for a break in the solid phalanx
of preachers who stand with both feet in the
trough and resent with sundry snarls the in
trusion of the unconsecrated hoof. To defeat
this unpatriotic expectation of trrfe mere laity,
an expectation no doubtfostered by the Jesuits,
the Rev. Benjamin Hudelson would boom his
own stock by entering the lists against the un
holy minions of Rome. It does not matter
that he is compelled ;o forget his oath. A so
<;>â¢!>â¢ which tearhes its members that they can
deny with an affidavit if necessary that they
belong to the A. P. A. evidently considers that
sworn promises, like piecrusts, are made only
to be broKen.
CONCKEN-ING PBINCIPLES.
The Rev. Mr. Iludalson seems to think that
we should take the principles of the A. P. A.
on faith. He gays "the principles of any in
dividual largely if not wholly determine his
character," therefore the advertised princi
ples of the A. P. A. are the best index of its
reel nature. I answered that in the case o,
dishonest men and of dishonest societies sueh 1
c statement was humbug, an J, though the Eev.
Mr. Hudeison blaterates about sophisms and
plausibility, I reiterate my answer now. The
common-sense of Americans insists on judg
ine every man and every society not by his
words, but by its deeds. â¢
Americans are the more anxious to insist on
this point when they are confronted with a
pacic of Pharisees whose morning and who=e
evening prayer is, "I am holier than thou."
The Eturdy horse-sense of our eonntrymen
Bhies at the sight of r tainted flock following
an ecclesiastical bellwether and bleating in
chorus, "We alone are pure." Americans have
not yet reached such a pitch of fatuity as to
believe canting impostors on their words. If
on entering my house I discover an individual
with whose features I am unacquainted stuf
fing mv spoons into his pockets, I do not im
mediately accept his declaration that his sole
intention is to protect my silverware. So when
1 discover a society made up of men, most of
whom are afraid or ashamed to disclose their
Identity, engaged in an attempt to grab every
lucrative office in sight, I am not bound to be
lieve their assertions that are merely endeav
oring to save the country from the- Pope.
111-TORY OF THE A. P. A.
Americans are the more suspicious of the ad
vertised principles ot Apa-ism when they re
member the history of the A. P. A. The Rev.
Mr. Hudelson imagines that I intend to
judge tne teachings of the A. P. A. by the in
terpretations of its enemies. Such is not my
desire. I have no wish to be unjust to the
A. P. A., and if I use a fact which is not au
thenticated, or Jf I quote a sentiment which is
rot genuine, or if I draw a conclusion which is
rot wan-anted by the premises, then I am
willing to make as large and as handsome an
apology as the circumstances require. In this
sad and shameful history of modern intoler
ance nothing is necessary but the truth. So
grotesque, however, are the facts that it may
be often necessary to remain very far on the
fcafe side of the line of verity. I know of noth
ing.in the annals of credulity so disgraceful, so
t-hocking. so pitiable and so vile as the history
of the madness known as the A. P. A.
According to the testimony of the Rev.
Adam Fawcett, one of the grand officers of the
organization, the A. P. A. was born in Clinton,
lowa, about eight years ago. This testimony
way be fouud in the Century Magazine for
July, 1894. Whether the statement is accur
ate or not I do not pretend to cay, but in this
City of San F-ancisco an analogous society
known as the American Protestant Association
w,as flourishing during the seventies. No one
knew much about the organization until the
eecretary grew too hilarious and was found by
a Chronicle reporter one morning dead drunk
on a sack of potatoes with his minute-books
lying beside him. â¢
The Chronicle published the minutes and'
the names of some of the members. They were
nearly all Orangemen, from Canada and the
norih ci Ireland. The exposureTVilled the so
ciety or drove it into a state of suspended ani
mation. I remark, however, with interest that
nome of the old members are more or less
prominent in the new A. P. A.
THE I*STKCCTIONS.
The A. P. A. generally begins its campaign
by the circulation of literature calculated to
etir up the people against the Roman Catholic
church. One of the commonest of these was
tailed, "Instructions to Catholic. Platform
of the Papal Party as Laid Down by the Pope
Pecci's Hands Rusy with American Affairs."
It purported to be a letter of instructions sent
out by the Catholic hierarchy for tte guidance
of Catholics. It was circulated quite exten
sively in Onio, aceordirrg to Dr. Washington
Gladden, a Protestant minister of that fctate
1 know of my own knowledge tnat it was cir
culated in California, but whether by the A
P. A. or not lam not prepared to say. How
ever, the sentiments contained in it have been
adopted by that society as correct descriptions
of the aims and teachings of the Catholic
chnrch. Moreover, it was published week by
week In scores.of the A. P. A. journals, and
thus used as one of the means to stir up A. P.
A. sentiment in a community.
The "Instructions to Catholics" was made to
appear as if ii were published by the Catholic
)t;sliops # of the United States. It bore the of
ficial signature of eight Archbishops, with the
countÂ«r-bignature of Cardinal Gibbons. It is
described as "decreed and ordered by the pro
vincial council at their session, August 5,
1890." In short, it was represented as a
Pennine document issued to Catholics by their
etcher clergy.
Let us examine a few of the paragraphs con
tinned in this wonderful document:
\V<> view with ajarni the rapid spread of edu

We view with alarm (be rapid diffusion of the
Knglls!i laagiiÃJte. It stands before the world as
tho tongue which hns for 300 years ever been oi>
postd to our holy church, Â»nd those who speak it
hare been foremost in assailing the holy see. '
We Â«re opposed to any system of schools that
teaohea the youth moru than Roman catechism, or
that teaches the young- to thinkâ it Is unnecessary,
a waste of time and money, when the holy fathf-r
has been appointed by God especially at the Vati
can Council of 1870 to do the thinking of this
worid. Ther -fore we call upon our subjects to do
all they cun to break down acd destroy the free
public schools of this I'roti-stant Nation, which has
compelled us to set up and maintain, at greadex
pense, psrochial schools to defend our faith, thus
lessening the incomes of the clergy.
. In order to tind employment for the many
thousands of the faithfu: who ure coming daily to
swell the ranks of our Catholic nrmy, which' will
In due time possess tliisland, we must secure con
trol of all the ciilea.railways, manufactories, mines,
sti-itm and sallinp vesselsâ above all, the pressâ in
fact every enterprise reiiuirins labor, In order to
fnralsb onr newcomers employment: this will
render It necessary to remove or crowd out the
American heretics, who are now employed. You
need not hesitate, it is your duty to do so; you
must not stop at anything to accomplish this end.
There are many wnys to consult you father con
fessor, but be careful to do nothing that will create
scandal.
It may seem Incredible to fensible men that
such a document should be credited, yet cred
ited it was. I know that this denial of its
authenticity will >>c the first seen by many
people here in California, who have looked
upon the instructions as unquestionably genu
ine. Any man who reflects may see the
thing is a forgery from top to bottom. Tne
Archbishops of this country may be knaves,
but certainly they are not fools. And fools
they were and egregious fools if they put their
names to such a document. - But so blind is
bieotry that the forgery was believed by thou
sands and tens of thousands in free America
and during the last decade of the nineteenth
century.
THE ENCYCLICAL.
But the instructions to Catholics were not a
circumstance to the famous encyclical. This
sensational production ordered that all the
Roman Catholics should, on a given day and
date, rise and massacre every Protestantwlthin
the borders of the United States.' â¢ When we-re
member that counting men, women and chil
dren, Catholics in this country are about one
in six of the population, we can werl imagine
the task the A. P. A. set the papists. Yet this
document was sent out from the A. P. A. press
by the million. It was kept for months in
their paper as "standing matter, "-and it was
recognized as one of the most efficient instru
ments of the propaganda. Let me copy the
encyclical in full, bad grammar and all:
. AN ENCYCI.ICAI.
A letter ' from Pope Leo XIII to the Romish
worla.
He asserts the dogma of the temporal right to
govern the earth ad libitum.
Heretics cut off from the chnrch. They.have no
rights. Kon-Itotnan citizens of the Uniied States
must have no privileges. AH Papists absolved
from their allegiance to the United States Uovern
meut.
Encyclical letter of his Holiness Leo XIII, by
divine providence, Pope:
; To the Jesuit?, patriarchs, primates. Archbish
ops anrt other ordinaries in peace and communion .
ith the Apostolic fsee of the entire world.
For the temporal reicn of the future Popes in
the^land discovered by 'Christopher Columbus,
known as the United States of America.
Venerable Brethren: Greeting and the apostolic
benediction, Leo, Bishop nnd servant of all the
servants of God, be it, remembered- by posterity
that he who is omnipotent, la heaven aad on earth
has couridea in his church, which is one holy
Catholic and apostolical, ana out of which there is
no salvation, to one man upon earth, namely, to
Peter, Prince and apostle, and to the Bishops of
Rome, his successors, with fall power to rule
over it. â¢ - ;â â  -.
This Pontiff alone has been constituted head
over all nations and kingdoms, aud invested In
power to destroy, to separate, to scatter, and sab
vert, to plant, build up, link together by mutual
charity, in order to preserve the faithful in the
spirit of unity and surrender them whole and en
tire to their Savior.
In order to fulfill the duties Imposed on us by
divine goodness wp labor incessantly to maintain
the unity of the Roman Catholic religion, which
God has visited with heavy conrlic's. to the end
that His own may be tried and for our correction;
but the numbers and powers of the wicked have so
â¢far prevailed that no portion of the earth has es
caped their attempts to propagate their infections
and dogmas, being supported among others by the
slave of every species of crime.
The American Republic, and the Protestant rul
ers, is the worst enemy of the church where secur
ity is offered.
This Republic havine seized upon the lands dis
covered by Christopher Columbus, a Roman
Catholic, and usurped the authority and jurisdic
tion of the supreme head of the church, the United
States is filled with obscure heretics.
- The Catholics have been opDressed and the
preachers of iniquity established."
The sacrifice of the mass, prayers, fastint:. absti
nence, celibacy and all the rites of Catholicity have
been ignored by Protestants.
The United Suites has been filled with books
containing the most flagrant heresies, of which the
Protestant version of the Bible Is chief. And not
content with adopting; its false and impious doc
trines, proselyting has been resorted to to turn the
Catholics from the one true church. The whole
Roman Catholic hierarchy and priesthood of the
world have been deprived of their livings by -the
Protestant heretics of America.
Courts have been set up and rendered, decisions
in ecclesiastical causes, and the people forbidden
to acknowledge the authority of the church or to
obey its ordinances and canonical decXsiort.
Naturalization oaths have been demauded to
subscribe to the United States Constitution, with.
nefarious laws and its nefarious teachings to re
nounc-' the true authority of the Roman pontiff;
to acknowledge him to be the head of both church
and state, whereby those who have persevered in
the faith have be<.-n compelled to suffer spiritual
affliction. . . .. - .
Catholic bishops and clergy have beati deprived
of vast lands, and this known to all nations and so
clearly proved that all palliation, argument or pro
test on the part of the United Stales is unavailing.
We find, moreover, that .impiety and crime have
Increased, that persecution against the religion of
Kome is redoubled by the Protestants dwelling in
the United States.
With deep sorrow we are now constrained to
have recourse to the arm of justice and obliged to
take action aÂ«ainst a nation that has rejected the
Pope as the head of all church and state govern
ments.
In virtue, therefore, of the divine authority by
which we have been placed on this supreme throne
of justice, an office so superior to our capability,
we do, in the plentitude of .apostolic power, declare
that all heretics and the eDcouruturs of heresy, to
gether will 'all adherents, have incurred the" sen
tence of excommunication, and they are hereby
cot off from the unity of the body of Jeans ClirisL
Moreover we pro laim the people of the United
states of Americato have forieitt-ci all riirht to rule
said Republic and also all dominion, d'hrnity and
privileges appertaining to it. We likewise declare
i hat al! subjects of every rank and condition in the
Cnsteit State . and every individual who has taken
an oath of loyalty to the United States in any wav
whatever, may be absolved from said oath, as also
from all duty, fidelity or obedience, on or about
the sth of September, 1893, when the Roman
Catholic Congress shall convene at Chicago, 111.,
as we shall exonerate them from all engagements
and on or about the feast of Ignatius Loyola, in
the year of our .Lord 1893, Jt will be the duty of
the faithful to exterminate all heretics found
within- the jurisdiction of the United states of
America.
As the circulation of this bull, by sending to all
places, woold become a matter of difliculty. it is
commanded that copies of it betaken anrt signed
by Jesuit notaries, subscribed by a Bishop and
signed ty the seal of our court. "They will then
have the same power and efficacy a s these presents
here.
pc.lven at St. Peter's, Rome, on the 25th day of
December, 1891, the fifteenth year of our Ponti
ficate. LKO XIII, Pope.
But, Mr. Editor, your readers may say surely
sensible people put no credit in such unmiti
gated rot We may admit that sensible people
could not credit it, but we must remember
that the number of fools is infinite. There is no
so fact easily demonstratudas that this encycli
cal was looked upon by thousands as a verit
able command from the Pope containig orders
for a veritable massacre.
GLADDENS TESTIMONY.
1. In the first place.letlme quote Dr. Washing
ton Gladden. Ido not call liim as a witness to
interpret the principles of the A. P. A., but I
call him as a witness to give testimony to facts
He says in the Century Magazine fo"r March,
1894:
A protestant minister of Columbus, Ohio, stated
not long aeo in an ecclesiastical assembly that he
had purchased a Winchester rifle to defend him
self against the Komanisls. The following extract,
from a letter written by a physician in one of the
smaller towns in Ohio described ii state of things
which is not uncommon in Western communi
ties:
'â¢We have been, and still are, having an excite
ment in our usually quiet town in regnrd to the
Catholic question. There is not a Calhdlio in the
entire township: but a lar^e nuinlior of our people
are intensely Nilrred up. sonic almost prouratcd
with fear, afraid that the Ca:ho!ics are about mak
ing a wholesale attack upun Protestants, killing
and plundering and destroying our schools and
churches. Uf course it obtains the strongest foot
hold Â»mÂ«g the ignorant and unthinking, yet Jt
seems to cause great uneasiness and fear among
many of the more intelligent."
One of my neighbors, a Justice of the Supreme
Court, having some acquaintance with this com
muni-yand feeling curious to know whether this
repon was correct, wrote aid satisfied himself of
its substantial accuracy. If the documents on
which the A. P. A. is making its catapaign. are
genuine this is prpclsrly the state of feelings whi.-h
oimiit to i\xisr. â¢â¢There is not a Catholic in the en
tire township," says my correspondent. In such
c-ommunities terror Is much more easily excited.
The peOole of these rural neighbors are told the
meat lurid tales of what is going on in the cities.
IttTBBARD's TESTIMONY.
2. In the Arena for June of the same year
Mr. Elbert Hubbard, a non-Catholic, and I
think a minister, gives similar testimony:
A year ago I was visitlnir an old farmer friend in
Illinois, and very naturally the talk was of the
Kreai fair. Was he going? Not he, he dared not
leave his home a single day; did I not know that
the Catholics had Deen ordered by the I ope to
burn the bams anrt houses of nfi heretics? It
sounded like a joke, hut I saw the gray eyes of this
old man flash and 1 knew he was terribly in earn

had a deep border of awtul black. 1 tried to te'.l

ened man who had been at the head of the Roman |
church for many yrars, and by no human proba- i
bility could he ao" a thing which would work such
Injury to the Catholics as well as the rest of human
ltv. (This pretended encyclical has since been
proved and acknowlM'gedaforgery.) Jiut my argu
ment was in vain. I was taken to the chief cler
gymen in the villace. a Presbyterian and a Meth
odist; both were full of fear and hatred toward the
CathoHs, with a little left over for each other.
They were sure that the order to kill and burn had
gone forth.
And bo in many towns and villages, as I jour
neyed, I fodnd this quaking f?ar. In many places
men were arming themselves with Winchester
rifles: many preachers never spoke in public with-
I out fanning the mime: A. P. A. lodges were rap
j Idly initiating new members, and lurid literature
which was being vomited lorth from presses in
I Louisville, Chicago, Omaha and Kansas City was
I bein^ Bpntoutjbroadcast.
For a year J have endeavored to find proof that
the Catholic churoh in America was arming and
drilling men. or countenancing such actions, as so
boldly stated by the leaders In the A. P. A. }n
many cities I have been given permission to
search every part of convents, monasteries and
churches where arms were said to be stored. In
vain hiis been my search. I have used all methods
known to detectiveajto find any Catholic in posses
sion of orders to maltreat his neighbors. Kore
qutst, or suKutstion, or hint showing a desire to
injure Protes:ants have I ever been able to trace
to a Catholic priest, bishop or other dignltury.
And It is now the conclusion of all unprejudiced
men who have Investigated the matter that the
I letters "encyclical," â¢â¢bulls'* and orders which are
being printed in A. P. A. papers and purporting to
come from the Koman Catholic church are flag
rant forgeries.
The A, P. A. seeks to soread 'hate. It thrives by
fear and its only weapon is untruth. This broad
cast sowing of falsehoods is doubtless done by men
who are thriving by it politioally and financially,
and the real victims Â«Â»re the people who believe
these outraceous stories, subscribe for the papers
and pay dues to be initiated into the A. P. A.
lodces- Yet whenever any one has taken up pen
to try to stop the insane panic he has been creeted
as a "Jesuit, hireling." Occasionally, however, we
fet a cU'nr note of protest from such men as B. O.
"lower, Washington Gladdr-n and David H wing â
men who have so placed themselves on record In
tiie pp.st that their attitude toward Borne cannot
possibly be misunderstood.
IN CALIFORNIA.
3. In this State of California the document
was used and with much success. The first I
heard of it was from Fresno, where it was dis
tributed during a school election to influence
voters against one of the candidates who "was a
Catholic. At that time the encyclical was
published in the Monitor (December 10, 1892),
together with ft complete refutation. But the
A. P. A. cared little for refutations. The next
time I heard of it was in this City. It was dis
tributed at the lectures of Dr. York, whose
speeches weje afterward reported in the local
A. P. A. organ. Bishop Montgomery informed
me that a well-dressed and apparently intelli
gent man had come to him with the encyclical
and said: "Surely you are too good a man to
do what this commands you." He had not
the slightest doubt about the authenticity of
the document. His only hope appeared to be
that the Bishop was not'as bloodthirsty as the
Pope.
THE TAPISTS ARMING.
To back up the commands given out in the
encylical it was assiduously whispered in all
the councils that, the Catholics were arming.
All over the country the word was sent that
rifles had been consigned to father such and
and such a one. One of the most wWely cred
ited of these canards was that a case marked
"mass wine" and addressed to Bishop Spalding
had been accidentally opened by the customs
inspector at Pcoria and found to containguus.
The customs inspector was overwhelmed with
letters from all parts of the United States and
Canada, and was at last compelled to print a
circular saying that Bishop Spalchng had not
received a packace through the Custom-house
for three years, and that never had he received
such a consignment as that mentioned In the
A. P. A. papers.
LOS ANGELES.
This report about arms concealed In churches
and secret drillings of Catholics was not un
known in California. An incident which was
reported in all the daily papers may be re
membered by your readers. Ex-Governor
Sheldon was making an A. P. A. speech in Lo6
Angeles. He stated that there were arms con
cealed in the .basement of the cathedral. A
Catholic gentleman present, named Donnefcan,
produced a certified check for $1000 and of
fered, to pay it over if arms should be found,
and asked that a committee be appointed to
search the cathedral on the spot. The ex-
Governor refused to accept the test, but the
Lord alone knows how many times he repeated
the old story afterward.
SAN FRANCISCO.
Here in San Francisco arras were located by
members ot the A. P. A. at various times in the
Old Mission, in the basement of St. Ignatius, iv
the cathedral and, at St. Charles. The boys of
the League of the. Cross seem to have caused
the patriots much anxiety. One rattle-brained
o!d idiot named Nichols saw about thirty of
them oil Shotweli street going through their
I maneuvers, and straightway he dashed bare
headed into tne Mission Benevolent Society,
A. P. A. Lodge No. (>, and informed the
"friends" t bat 500 able-bodied men weredrill
inc with Winchester rifles in front of his
house â of course gettinc ready to clean out
Protestants.
Only a few â weeks ago the Cadet Company of
Pt. Patrick's parish attended the rally at Odd
Fellows' Hall. Its progress was observed by a
patriot named Terry, who informed his lodge
at the next meeting that he saw "about forty
young -micks,' armed with swords and carry
ing as fine an American flag as ever he saw
marching along the streets." He eloquently
denounced the whole performance and nearly
scared the few Scandinavians present who un
derstood English out of their senses.
THE SAN RAFAEL FORTIFICATION.
But perhaps the most eloquent tribute to the
utter fatuity of Apaism whs the affair of the
San Rafuel'Orphan Asylum. At that institu
tion the water supply has Always been a seri
ous problem. To solve it Father Crowley a few
years ago built a reservoir on the top of a hill
back of the institution. A vigilant patriot
spied the peculiar structure and immediately
visions ot armed papists flashed before his
mind. Sitting down he dashed off the follow
ing communication, which was duly inserted
in the American Patriot June 28, 1894:
Rome's Bloody Hand.
Preparations to Destroy the Lives ot Americans
Who Try to Free the Land From the
Hand of Eome.
San* Francisco, June 23, 1894.
Editor Amrriran Patriot: Though living in the
midst of Papists, tho trumpet voice of the Patriot
aroused me for the first time to a sense of thÂ« dan
ger that threatens us la this free hind. I believe
in equal rights for all loyal citizens, but traitors
should have no right or protection . under the in
stitutions which they endeaver to overthrow.
After careful investigation I have satisfied my
self that the charges made by you against the
Romish priests are true in every respect : and that
a great many more serious charges might be made
which are equally well founded in fact.
Do you know that all over our country military
organizations are being formed in Catholic
churches? Yonng men, raised In parish schools, Rre
drilling and arming night after night, in order, 1 am
told, "to shoot down the A. P. A.'s." I have seen
with my own eyes a large number of rifles hidden
away in the basement of a Komish church at the
Mission, ami I am credibly informed that the beer
bibblog pastors of nearly all of these churches are
turning their residences into veritable arsenals.
It was reported ii few weeks ai;o that some
members of the A mericun Protective Association,
under the guidance of the Key. Mr. Henry, had
determined to make a descent upon a Roman
I'atbolic Orphan Asylum, near San ttafael. for the
purpose of releasing the poor children imprisoned
there.
Immediately the superintendent of the place
threw up a for;lfica:lon on a hill commanding the
institution, aud introduced two pieces of cannon to
blowout oT existence any American citizen who
might attempt to go there in the interest of re
ligion and humanity. The fort is there still, "and
there," the oilieial in charge swears, "it must
stay."
You see, Mr. Kditor, what a brood of traitors you
have to deal with.
The grand and e'.orious movement of which your
paper is the advocate has scared them out of their
hypocrisy, and now their true character shows
itself.
We need unity and numbers now to stem the
current of Popish power, and all true Americans
should rally to our standard. More anon, from
yours iv a noble cause, David A. Anderson.
Of course Apadom was chilled to its marrow.
One ventursome patriot, however, picked up
courage enough to investigate. After careful
reconnoitering he at last satisfied himself that
the fortification was only a water tank, and his
disgust was so great that it had to Jind an out
let in print.
ST. MARY'S COLLEGE.
The arms in St. Mary's Collesre, however, was
a sensation which thrilled every true A. P. A.
from thÂ« Willamette to San Diego.
It appear* that there is a cadet company
among the boys of St. Mary's College. In all
there were from 100 to 200 ' boys in the organi
zation. They were armed with condemned
rifles, bought several years ago at the Beuicia
Arsenal, and which were warranted not to go
off under the severest provocation.
When the fire occurred in St. Mary's College,
in 1894, the arms were piled up on the campus,
and afterward carried off to a store in the city.
Straightway the Occident, the Presbyterian
and the Patriot, the A. P. A. organ of this
town, came out with blood-curdling reports ot
the plots laid by the priests to murder all Piot
estants. The story spread like wildfire. One
reverend idiot up in Salem, Or., publicly
thanked God that the college had been burned.
It grew as it went, and when it reached San
Diego it had swelled to the dimensionsof 700
stands of arms. The Santa Ana Blade of March
27, 1895, gave the lie in this form, nnd it was
copied by the Pasadena Daily livening Star,
which quoted the Rev. Campbell Coyle of Oak
land, Victor Stewart Â»nd A. J. McMurtry as
sponsors for the pnblication. The father, how
-1 ever, of toe lie was the Rev. Barton \V. Perry,
whose distinguished services to the Occident
almost terminated its existence, and who is
generally suspected to be one of the many old
women who infest our pulpits in male disguise.
These, Mr. Editor, are specimens of some of
the tactics employed by the A. P. A. They bear
out my contention tha; the organization was
begotten in fraud and brought forth iv fojÃery.
I have, however, only touched the outskirts
of the subject. The depth and the density of
the popular ignorance which could permitthc
use of such documents as these given above
may appear phenomenal, but the depth and
density of the moral depravity which would
permit the employment of such tactics I am
yet to chronicle will appear more phenomenal
still. Yours truly, P.-C. Yokkk.
HUDELSON REPLIES.
Tho A. P. A. President Continues
His Analysis of Chancellor
Yorke's Criticism.
Office of the
State Council of California,
Room 40, Academy of Sciences building, 819
Market street.
San Francisco, Cal., Feb. 15, 1895.
To the Editor of The Callâ Deab Sir: I inclosed
my letter yesterday with the consideration of
Father Yorke's reply to the fifteenth of the
questions which I had asked him. That fa-r in
his communication we had found many princi
ples of the A. P. A. of which Father Yorke ap
proved and had gone far toward demonstrat
ing that even from the standpoint of the Chan
cellor of the Archdiocese of San Francisco the
American Protective Association is not nearly
so black as he himself would have the public
to believe. Resuming, then, the consideration
of his letter at the point where 1 left off I beg
to submit the following.
QVE9TION 18.
"Does not Blr. Yorke believe thnt exemption
from taxation is equivalent to a grant of public
funds, and is he hostile to the taxatiou of all prop
erty the title to which is not vested in the Na
tional or State Government or their subdivisions?"
Youkk'sKkplyâ In non-prod active operations to
say that exemption from taxation is equivalent to
a grant from public funds is rubbish. I believe
that the exemptions from taxation .granted by the
State of California to young orchards, for instance.
are dictated by sound public policy, and are in no
sense grants of public f u nds.
Mor over, I believe that in those States where
exemption from taxation is granted to churches
the result is a thousaud times more beneficial to
the State than the aitry sums received in tax
ation would be. In i allfornia church property
has been always taxed and therefore there is no
nepd for that plank in the A. P. A. platform.
Moreover, I believe the MethoUst bishops and
preachers who are ngit- tine the repeal of the tax
are just as good Americans as Benjamin Hudel
son, and I know that they pay more taxes than the
whole a. P. A. put together.
In this reply there is much bosh. Father
lorke s individual belief as to the American
ism of "Methodist Bishops and ptcachers." or
as to "the soundness of certain matter's of
public policy," or as to the beneficial or non
beneficial results of "exempting church prop
erty from taxation in other States"â these "cut
no ice," are not evidence and are, therefore,
irrelevant. And for that reason I relegate
them to the "rubbish-heap."
As to other matters Father Yorke says: "In
non-productive operations to say that exemp
tion from taxation is equivalent to a grant of
public funds is rubbish." Perhaps it is rub
bish from his point of view; but, nevertheless,
the statement is true, and so axiomatic as to
scarcely need exemplification here. If I owe
$1000, whether it be to the State for taxes or to
a private individual for groceries, and if I be
forgiven the debt, who can deny that such
forgiveness is equivalent to a grant of the said
sum of $1000, whether I be engaged in a "non
productive operation" or not?
Father Yorke's phrase, "in non-productive
operations," is infelicitous, because vague
and indefinite as to meaning; or, if from his
poiut of view it be considered felicitous, it
Can only be because It conceals his meaning as
he desires. If intended to mean anything at
all, the expression renders the father's idea
that church property is "non-productive," aud
should therefore be exempt from taxatiou.
The same argument would logically render
exempt from taxation all vacant city'lots and
all uncultivated outside lands, and perhaps
the father thinks that too would be "sound
public policy." Perhaps he denies that this
would be equivalent to a grant of public funds
Perhaps he wouid like to deny, also, that
"water runs down hill."
Father Yorke refers to the exemption from
taxation granted to young orchards; he may
also be aware that growing crops are exempt.
Does he not know that the exemption arises
largely from the difficulty of accurately value
mg sucli crops, aud that the exeiaptiou does
not extend to the land upon which the crops
are giowa or to the buildings in which they
are stored, or to the private residonce of the
grower?
Mr. Yorke says that "church property In I
California has been always taxed, and there- |
fore there is no need for "that plank in the A.
P. A. platform." Is Mr. Yorke ignorant that j
there are other Stales besides California in the
Union? Or upon what does he base his asser-.
tion that then? is no need for this plank in i
what is the Xational platform oi the A. P. A.,
formulated as I have heretofore explained, by
the Supreme Council of the United States ?
Mr. Yorke also declares that he knows that
certain people who advocate exempting church
property from taxation "pay more taxes taan
the whole A. P. A. put together." Inasmuch
as Father Yorke ostensibly objects to the A. P.
A. upon the ground of its secrecy, it is passing i
strange how intimately he is acquaiuted (to
hear him talk) with the individuals who com
pose its membership and with their private !
affairs. His all-containing knowledge "of the
affairs of the tax collectors' and the assessors'
offices of every county of every State in the
Union so nearly approaches the infinite as to
be appalling. He declares he can prove all his
statements. Will he kindly, for the edification
oi the public, prove this one concerning the i
comparative amount of taxes paid by Meth- j
otiist Bishops and preachers and dv members l
of the A. P. A.?
As a matter of fact, this principle goes far to
explain the animus of the Catholic hostility to
the A. P. A. The church's pocket-book is
touched, and her champions rage accordingly.
It is a matter of financeâ a question of dollars
and cents and not of religion.
QUESTION 17.
"Does Mr. Yorlce favor the enlistment in the mili
tary arm of the Government ot any one not act
ually a citizen of the United States?"
Yobke's Answerâ Any man who is willing to j
offer his life in the defense of our Government, and
who swears allegiance to the flat;, is tit to be an
American soldier. Jn the War of the Revolution
and ot the Rebellion, men who were not citizens
earned their citizenship at the prlcu of their blood.
(Tirade.)
Father Yorke, yon be? the question. I ask
you if you favor the enlistment of non-citi
zens in the United States army and navy, and
you say that certain men are fit for American
soldiers. Will you answer my question? And
in future In this discussion please keep just a
trifle nearer the point at issue and not go wan
dering away to the times of the American i
Revolution, when this country had not yet per- |
fected its permanent form of government nor
enacted its naturalization laws.
question 18.
"Does Mr. Yorlce object to our requiring some
proof of the aoiiity and honest intention to be
come self-supporting American citizens from all
immigrants?"
Yokke'B Hepi.yâ l think such a proof Is neces
sary to protect ourselves against pauper inimigra-
Uon. Besides (Tirade.)
If Father Yorke thinks such proof is neces
sary he can scarcely condemn those who advo
vatc its requirement. Therefore, he approves
this principle of tiie A. P. A.
question 19.
"Would Mr. Yorke object to the repeal of the act
authorizing the naturalization of minors without a
previous declaration of intention ; and Is he- hostile
to a provision by law that persons to be natural
ized must speak the language of the land and must
prove seven years' continuous resilience in this
country from the date of the declaration of inten
tion?"
Yorke's Answerâ l am of the opinion that
minors who have been raised and educated in
America are just *s competent to become citizens
as the Canadian or .-candinavian who has been
here for seven. I consider it a good thing that, all
candidates lor citizenship should know .English,
bull would â (Tiraae).
The supple activity with which Father
Yorke dodges about a question or passes over
it, tou&hing only the high spots, is amusing.
I ask him if he lms any objection to requiring
a declaration of intention from minors pre
vious to their naturalization, and if he objects
to raising the required time of previous resi
dence to seven years. He 'remarks that he
thinks that minors raised in this country are
"just aa competent to become citizens" as
| members of certain nationalities '-who have
| been here for seven years." But that is no
reply to the question, and here again he has
dodged an issue.
QUESTION 20.
"Does Mr. Yorke object to a protest against the
laxity with which -our present naturalization laws
are administered?"
Yorke's answerâ Like the purification of poH
tics, this is a matter which depends much on the
judge who administers the law. No law should be
administered with laxity. But when a (Tirade
against the A. P. A.)
How plainly Father Yorke "has not" ad
ministered my question! I asked if he per
sonally "objects to a protest against laxity
etc." In return he quotes a sonorous gener
ality, "No law should be administered wi'h
laxity." Score oae more dodge for tha priest
To. make matters worse he remarks that
"This (his objection or non-objection to such a
protest asratnst laxity in administration) is a
matter which depen-ls much on the Judjre
I who administers the law." Now, what does ha
i mean by that? Why should his "objection to
protest agamst laxity" depend on the Judge
i (â who administers? Does he mean that if the
Judge who administers laxly were a Catholic
he would object to protest "against such ad
i ministration?
I -And will he kindly inform us wherain his
objection or non-objection to protest is "like
purity in politics"? Indeed, for a reply which
â¢comes from one who claims ususual skill in
the use of English for the expression oi ideas
his remarks are certainly queer.
-V QUESTION 21.
"Is Mr. Yorke hostile to tbe public inspection of
all hospitals, asylums, r.-formatorien or other ln-
J stltutions Id wntch p<> ople are under restraint?"
Vobke's Rkflt- livery institution which keeps
i persons under restraint should be open at all times
to inspection by the civil authorities, bacauseâ
(Tirade.)
How difficult it is to keep Mr. Yorke to the
point at issue. I ask him if he objects to the
public inspectiou of all hospitals, asylums, re
i formatories, etc. He returns a trite general
j ization and calls it an answer. Mr. Yorke I
I know as well as you do that "Every institution
which keeps persons in restraint should be
open at all times to inspection by the civil au
thorities," but 1 have not been able yet to se
cure from you an answer to my question as to
whether you are hostile to such public inspec
tion. lam afraid I shall have to "write you
down" as dodging again, Mr. Dogberry.

Father Yorke makes mistakes. He has not
answered this question. He has answered a
somewhat similar question, question 7. In reply 1

Father Yorke'e opinion as to what experience
has or has not demonstrated is irrelevant. Ho
manages, however," to get in edgewise his
opinion that the "present time for naturaliza
tion is long enough," and so saves the lot from I
the rubbish-heap. This answers my question
with a. "yes," and puts the priest in direct
opposition to the A. P.' A. "
The sentence, "A foreigner who It not
Americanized in five years never will be
Americanized," is an unsupported statement.
Father Yorke claims he can prove all his state

public by proving this one? ..

CAMPBELL DEALS FARO.
A Fake Game in Which His
Honor Lost the Bank Roll
in One Deal.
Ke Is Caught in the Act of Drawing
Two Cards to Win the Last
Bet Male.
A faro game was raided on the corner of
Geary and Kearny streets early yesterday
morning, and the outfit was taken as evi
dence to the Califoinia-street police sta
tion, but was afterward sent to the new
City Hall. However, it remained Jong
enough in the Brat-named station for a
pame to be started and finished with Judge
Campbell as dealer, Lieutenant Esola as
lookout and Officer Burnett and I'atrol
driver John Martin as players.
Soon after the outfit hat) been taken to
the station Judge Campbell was espied on
the corner of Kearny and California streets.
lie was invited over by Lieutenant Esola
lo inspect the haul.
The Judge was either overcome by recol
lections of younger days or, possibly, curi
osity started dim on the downward path,
for he immediately arranged the layout
and started a deal with the aforesaid look
out and players. He was soon engrossed
in his work, and from the scien ihc way
in which he handled the pasteboards an
interested onlooker ventured a remark
that the Judge had missed his calling, but
as the game ended so disastrously for the
dealer he has determined to remain merely
a Judge and allow others to be the enorts.
John Martin, thÂ© player who keptj the
game, was in luck from the lime the first
card was turned. He played the deuce
for $_'O worth of cnecks and won. Jle
then doubled his bet on the same card and
won again. This seemed to worry the
dealer considerably, but he merely kept
taking down the bets that were lost by
Officer Burnett, who seemed to play with
hard luck or poor judgment; hut maybe
he took compassion on the dealer, or else
they were combined to fleece Martin.
However, Martin played all his checks
again on the deuce and won again.
This last lucky bet reduced the bank roll
about one-half. Excitement was now at
high pitch as Burnett was all in and there
were but one or two more turns to bo
made. Martin at this time played the
deuce and tray with sufficient checks to tap
the roll. The onlookers almost held their
Lreatn, the looKout was in a nervous
fctraia and the dealer was steadily schem
ing as he turned the cards. By some un
been way the dealer had looked under the
box and noticed that Martin's bet was
6ure to win. Then bis sKill came to
the surface and he deftly drew two cards
at one time from the box and was about to
take down the checks when the lookout
notified him of the deception.
He merely smiled and said it wa9 an ac
cident and that he had lost his bank roll
In one deal. It was an exciting exhibition
and all breathed easier at the finale.
The game was not played for money, but
as much interest was taken in the game by
the dealer as though all things depended
upon his winning. M-irtin declares he
would like to play for $20 a mm with the
Judce as dealer, but he says he would birÂ«

pal witnesses has consented to tali. Miss |
Mattie Overman, about whom so much [
Isas been written and said and against j
whose character the most damaging in
sinuations have been made, consents to
tell the story of her life to The Call.
True, she does not deal directly with
the more recent events of which she Is the
central figure, reserving that for the
council, but she grapples without the least ;
show of hesitancy or fear of contradiction I
the stories involving the moral side of her
nature, from childhood down to the pres- j
ent time.
"I might jnst as well have done this long j
ago," said Miss Overman yesterday, by j
way of introduction, "but before I could !
collect my wits all those horrible stories
from Tacoma. Spokane, Walla Walla and !
other points, founded only in the imagi
nation of sensational correspondents, were j
published. I was indignant that such \
things should be said, and so made up my ;
mind to deny nothing until the hubbub I
had in a measure ceased. If anything is
to be said now I want to commence at the
very beginning of my life, so there may be
no after bickerings of things left untold.
"I was born April 9, 1363, in Benton
County, of the then new State of Oregon.
My parents were among the earliest set
tlers in the valley, having crossed the
plains in 1852, in wagons drawn by oxen.
Their first stopping place was Portland,
but not having a prophetic vision of the
future greatness of that city, they soon
moved to Alsea Valley, where they lived
for nearly a score of years. There I was
born, being the eighth of a family of thir
teen children.
"I was five j'cars old when my parents
i decided to move to the Territory of Wash
ington, where they later settled on a farm
in Colunioia County. After years of toil
I and .labor it became a place rich in re
j sources, and I recall it now as a spot full of
the sunshine of happy youth. In my six
teenth year, father disposed of his farm,
and we moved to the town of Walla Walla,
where we took a house sufficiently ample
for the accommodation of roomers and
boarders. It was at this place I met the
man whom I afterward married..
"I never while in that city engaged in the
dressmaking business, nor did my sister,
who was with us during my residence
there. I knew absolutely nothing of this
kind of work at that time, being only 17
years old. The statement therefore pub
lished in the daily papers to the effect that
I accepted $1000 from a man in order to es
tablish a dressmaking business is utterly
without foundation. It was also said t'iat
I secured $300 from a- clerk in this same
man's store, but was forced to .return it.
This is unqualifiedly false, both as to re
ceiving the money and returning that
which I never had.
"Very much against the better judg- j
ment of my parents, I went to Spokane in
the month of November, 1885, marrying
on m3 T arrival there D. W. Silveira, who at
that time was keeping a boarding-house.
AftÂ«r a short residence in Spokane we [
moved to Helena, Mont., remaining there
until January 1, 1888. After a few moDths
of married life, I discovered among other
things that Mr. Silveira was unable to sup
port me. Being then clever with tho nee
dle, I began first as a seamstress and later
branched out as a full-fledged dressmaker.
"This occupation I followed successfully
for more than twelve months prior to my
departure from Helena. Just here let me
say that about one year previous to this
time I experienced conversion, and was
taken into full membership in the First
Baptist Church of that city. I soon had a
wide circle of friends in the church. I be
came a member of the 1. O. G. T., of which
I was assistant secretary for one term,
being in eood standing in the-lodge when
I left.
"On leaving Helena I obtained a letter
of introduction from my pastor to any
church where I might care to present it.
i This letter spoke of me iv the kindliest
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1896.
manner, recommending me highly to any
one who might be interested. Later on I
presented this letter to a Baptist church in
Spokane, and as a result learned one of
the bitterest lessons of my life. As soon
as the minister learned that I was married
and living apart from my husband the
sympathy and interest formerly extended
mo were withdrawn.
"All this, however, is of little interest to
any one, so I will skip that part of my life.
When I left Helena it was much against
the wish of Mr. Silveira. In fact he wont
so far as to dispose of some of my hard
earned pennies at the gaming table, think
ing thereby to keep me as his chief sup
port. And why not? It is pleasant to
have a little home, especially if that home
is neither an expense or burden to oue. So
it was with Mr. Silveira. For fully a year
before I left him I wholly supported "my
self, even to paying the laundry bills ana
house rent. On my departure from Helena,
such garments covered my back and filled
my trunk as only my money had pur
chased.
" After a short visit to my home at
Walla Walla I wrote to him, on the ad
vice of my parents, who up to that time
had known nothing of my domestic
troubles, advising him that I would never
live with him again, but would seek re
dress through the courts. Being afraid
that he mighfattempt to carry out his oft
repeated threat to take my life I went im
mediately to live with* a married sister in
Spokane, thinking to escape him should
he seek me in Walla Walla. It seems,
however, that my fears were groundless,
for I never heard from him directly, even
when notice was sent of my application
for divorce, until, true to the nature of the
man,' he attempted to strike me through
the medium of the press since the devel
opments in the Brown-Davidson scandal.
The recent reports sent from Spokane con
cerning me have not one grain of truth to
rest on. To begin with, I was never
known there as Miss Overman, for I did
not use my maiden name, which I had re
pained through the divorce courts, until I
took up my residence in Tacoma.
"The block where I was reported to have
lived in Spokane was in course of construc
tion when I came away. My life there
was extremely quiet. I attended church
regularly and it was in Sabbath school I
first met Mrs. Tunnell. After closing up
my business in Spokane I went to Tacoma,
where my parents had moved. During
my stay of perhaps a year in the former
place I began dressmaking in families and
with the exception of two or three months
found steady employment as long as I re
mained there. My parents since leaving
the old farm had many reverses and mis
fortunes, and as the older children were all
married or away from home it was the
pleasure and happiness of my life to give
them some comforts which the\ T might not
otherwise have enjoyed.
"I was never fond of the eayeties of life,
my whole time and attention being given
to work and study, that we might be
blessed with music, and good and whole
some books with which to cfceer our fire
side when we gathered of evenings when
the day's labors were finished. My sister,
with whom I had formerly resided in
Spokane being then a widow, resolved to
take up her residence in Seattle. -After
her dressmaking business had sufficiently
increased I spent a portion of my time as-
I sisting her. It was then I had an un
pleasant business experience which has
been so recently widely heralded. I met a
party whom I now recognize as my Seattle
slanderer, and as I was in possession of
unpleasant.facts concerning him this was
I an opportunity to strike me, which he
could not resist. The cause of this man's
bitterness toward me is simple. I had un
wittingly revealed to his wife that he was
a regular visitor of a lady. I thought
that he was merely a relative.
"I positively deny that I ever attempted
blackmail on any prominent man of Seat
tle, or that I ever behaved in public or
private in the disgraceful manner accred
ited me. But to return to Tacoma. My
work there was mainly among church
people. Incidentally let me say that never
at any time did I work in any but respect
able families. The horrible statement that
I visited disreputable places is utterly
without foundation.
'â¢While engaged in a pleasant family I
met Mrs. Brown, who expressed a desire
to have me assist her with some dress
work. So after a time it came about that
at her dinner tablo I was introduced to her
husband, Dr. C. O. Brown. My acquain
tance with him in Tacoma was slight and
principally of a business character. Mrs.
Brown was always kind, and our acquain
tance by the time of her departure from
Tacoma had ripened into friendship to the
extent of occasionally dining with her and
evenings spent in social intercourse. She
had noticed my failing health, and kindly
invited me to accompany her to San Fran
cisco for a rest and change of climate. At
that time I could not accept,
"In the winter of 1893 I decided, on ac
count of my ill-health, to visit my sister,
who had in the meantime moved to San
Francisco. I left home in December, stop
ping in Victoria a few days to visit the
sister who had formerly resided in Seattle
and had for business reasons taken up her
borne in the first-named city. Three or
four days after my arrival there I was
taken down with neuralgia, and for two
weeks did not leave my bed. As soon as I
was able to travel I took the 6teamer for
San Francisco. My stay in Victoria
altogether did not exceed three weeks, and
my habits were necessarily of the quietest
possible character. I met no one in a
social way.
"Since this trouble came I have been
literally harassed to death, with, letters
and callers. Some of the letters were
amusing, others insulting, and many full
of expres&ionsof confidence and sympathy.
There have been offers of managers and
theatrical propositions innumerable. Such
as these I have not given a second thought.
'â¢Now as to my staj in San Franciaco, I
can say nothing at present, except that
when 1 have told my story to the council
Dr. Brown will be cleared of all the charges
resting against him.
"The Tunnell letters are of easy explana
tion, as are the other acts with which I am
C/edited."
Several times during the recital of her
story Miss Overman showed deep emotion,
particularly when she referred to the re
ports of her career in Spokane, Seattle,
"Walla Walla and other Northern cities.
There was apparently nothing of the
"manufactured" in her recital of these
earlier events. She tales in a perfectly
plain, straightforward way, without any
affectation and with no other purpose
seemingly than to tell the truth. She is at
all times a ready conversationalist, quick
to answer questions and never nervous.
Her appearance before the council will be
an event if nothing more.
MRS. COOPER CHARGED.
Mrs. Dr. C. O. Brown Accuses Her
of Stuffing the Church Ballot-
Affidavits In Support.
Mrs. Brown openly charges Mrs. Sarah
B. Cooper with attempting to corrupt the
ballot of the First Congregational Church
on the ovening of February 5, at which
time the pastor was given a vote of confi
dence. These charges are supported by a
numoer of sworn affidavits.
To all of this Mrs. Cooper, over her own
signature, makes the simple reply, "I do
not consider the matter worthy of consid
eration."
Mrs. Brown, in support of tne affidavits
published below, makes the following fcen
eral arraignment of Mrs. Cooper:
"I desire now to place before the com
munity, not in the form of mere state
ments, but of solemn affidavits, some facts
which will show how sincere Mrs. Cooper
is in her loudly advertised claim that she
is acting with zeal for the purity of the
church.
"This hat been her claim in her bitter,
malign and untruthful attack upon the
character of my husband.
"The Congregational church is self-gov
erning. It depends, humanly speaking,
on the purity of its ballot for the con
tinuance of its life. To lift one's hand or
to arise and give one's vote for or against
any measure is one of the most solemn
acts of Christian responsibility in such
church.
â¢'lf the ballot of the self-governing church
should become corrupt nothing could save
that church from disgrace and final disrup
tion. There cannot possibly be any more
serious oftense than to assist in giving or
procuring a corrupt ballot at any church
meeting.
"With this in mind what will be the
verdict of the people of San Francisco
upon the facts set forth in the following
affidavits? They show that Mrs, Sarah B.
Cooper deliberately sought to induce a
person who had never before been in the
church and who was not Â» member to vote
against my husband.
"These facts speak for themselves. They
show that Mrs. Cooper, by the use of false
votes, would not have scrupled to defeat
the vote of confidence in my husband, de
stroy my home and blast the happiness of
my family.
â¢'Mrs. Cooper has made declarations
without proof. I herewith substantiate
my declarations by the proofs.
''These affidavits abundantly show the
methods to which Mrs. Cooper has de
scended to defame my husband, and
further show the kind of weapons which
Â»be is attempting to forge for the comple
tion of her inquisitorial task.
"This community has drawn the veil of
silence anrl charity over tbat awful experi
ence which clouded her own domestic life.
She should be the last to raise her voice in
bitterness in advance of official investiga
tion. By what right does she exercise a
judicial function- which does not belong to
any other member of the church, and who
gave her this right to declare my husband
guilty before he has been examined by a
proper tribunal? Sne proclaims that her
life in this community has been an open
book. It takes hut a small attempt to read
in tliat open book somethings that honor
cannot sanction. But I will not at this
time pursue this theme.
"I have already lair! at her door one of
the most serious offenses against social
order, and I now present to the public the
indisputable evidence that she deliberate
ly attempted to corrupt the ballot of the
First Congregational Church on the even
ing of February 5, 18'J6, when, in spite of
her opposition, the church overwhelming
ly voted its confidence in my husband.
"In view of such facts as these and of
her demand that my husband should cease
to occupy his pulpit until his good name
is vindicated, do not modesty and honor
require that she should desist from teach
ing until her own good name is vindicated
from these awful charges?
"For such offenses against the civil
ballot men go to prison. But this offense
was against the cnurch of God. Therefore
nothing more can be done than to deliver
the offender over to that contempt which
an infamous act deserves. Those promi
nently engaged in the suffrage movement
in this Btato may well raise the Inquiry
whether the ballot in such handa would
tend to greater purity.
"It will be seen by the affidavits that
Mrs. Blanchard admitted less under oath
than she had told her friends. This was
to be expected irom so ardent an admirer
of Mrs. Cooper, who had been aroused to
the seriousness of her conduct. But it will
also be Been that she swears to the
essential facts, and that she â¢ ad
mits having stayed at the church
meeting when all but members and
pew-holders were requested to go, and that
she falsified Her word by saying that she
was a member of the church when she was
not, and that she later told Mrs. Cooper
that she was not a member before Mrs.
Cooper urged her to vote. The other affi
davits tell the whole truth as Mrs. Blanch
ard told it to her friends beforo sue had
been put on her gnard.
"These facts came to me wholly without
my seeking, and I now make this state
ment only with sorrow that Mrs. Cooper's
unprecedented attack on Dr. Brown and
and her conduct in the procuring of a false
vote make it necossary."

I am not a memoer of the First Congrega
tional Church of San Francisco, Cal., but my
sympathy being with Mrs. Sarah I!. Cooper, I
attended the business meeting held at the
First Congregational Church on the evening
of tho sth day of February, 189U, for the pur
pose of protecting Mrs. Cooper, and I occupied
a seat on her right during the whole of the
business meeting. When the first vote was
taken I arose from my seat and voted with
Mrs. Cooper against Dr. Brown, the pastor of
the church, but in doing so I was acting under
great excitement and it was an accident that
1 did so. Just after tho first vote was
taken Mrs. Simpson, who lives at 317 Jones
street, in the City of ban Francisco, State of
California, leaned over to me and asked me if
I was a member of the church and I answered,
"Yes," in order to get rid of her, as I did not
want her to be giving me away before all the
ladies near us. Itold Mrs. Cooper a few min
utes later that 1 was not a member of the
church, and when the second vote was taken
Mrs. tooper asked me why I was not voting. I
told her I was not a member of the church
and had no right to vote, but she still urged
me to do so.
On the next day I made a friendly call on
Mrs. Simpgon at her home, 317 Jones street,
San Francisco, Cal. Ido not think her sister,
Mrs. Church, was present during. e.ll of our in
terview. 1 told Mrs. Simpson that I was uot &
member of the church and asked her what she
thought of my staying at the business meeting.
She said that I behaved like a lady while there.
I told her ihat Mrs. Cooper asked me why 1 was
not voting. I was worried, because "people
said that I had voted against Dr. Brown.

in behalf of the Rev. C. O. Brown, pastor of the
First Congregational Church in said City and
County, in an action now ponding in said
church, who, being by me first duly sworn,
she then and there testified as follows:
"I am a member of the First Congregational
Church of San Francisco, Cal., and as such at
tended the Business meeting of 6aid church,
held at 7:30 o'clock p. m. on the fifth day of
February, A. i). 180(5, and was present during

ing. I am personally acquainted with Mrs.

meeting, and she took an active "part therein
con cerning all matters relating to Rev. C. O.
Brown.
"Sirs.. Sarah B. Cooper was seated in front of
me and the next seat on her right was occu
pied by Mrs. Lena Blanchard, who resides at
826 Bush.street, in the City and County of San
Francisco, who is also personally known to
me. Mrs. Sarah 11. Cooper and Mrs. Lena
Blanchard occupied seats located in the front
portion of lha assemblage, directly in
front 'of the rostrum of the meeting
rooin of the said First Congregational
Church, where the said business meeting was
held. During the early part of the session of
said business meeting, I leaned over and asked
Mrs. Lena Blanchard if she was a member of
car church, and the informed me thnt she
was, also stating that she had joined our
church six weeks previous, and that she had
come to the business meeting that evening in
order to help Mrs. Cooper in the fight against
Rev. C. O. Brown.
"On the following day she called on me here
at my residence, and addressed me very pleas
antly, asking me if I thought. she was a mem
ber of our church. I said yes, certainly, of
course I did, as you told me you were. She
then said, 'Well, I am not; but I went down
there and kept very quiet, so I would
not be asked to go out.' Mrs. Blan
chard further stated tnat she ielt very
horry for Mrs. Cooper, and thought that
she bad been treated shamefully; 'Mrs.
Cooper,' she continued, 'urged me to get up
and vote, but I sat still and would not do so.'
I told Mrs. Blanchard that it was a good thing
that she did not vote, and some people would
have questioned her right to do so. Mrs.
BlanchY.rd further said: 'I really feel very
sorry for Dr. Brown, granting that he is
guilty.' Just then my sister, Mrs. Church,
came into, the room and said: 'Why, Mrs.
Blanchard, I hear you are a member of our
church'; and Mrs. "Blanchard said, 'Oh, no, I
am not, but Mrs. Cooper asked me several
times to vote.'
"In making trie foregoing deposition I have
only told the truth, and have none but the

'Oh, no, lam not; lam a member of t lie Grace

and have been going there ever since this

"My sister then remarked to Mrs. Blanchard :
â¢It is a good thing that you did not do so, as
some member of the church would have ques

then remarked: 'I am very sorry for Dr.

of the sth day of February, A. B. 1896. I saw
Mrs. Cooper there, she and her daughter sat

Mrs. Lena Blanchard. sat on the right of Mrs.
Cooper. When the voting commenced and the
business of the meeting brought up, the first
vote that was cast was for a:i appeal from the

voted. She voted twice at that meeting, and
my daushter challenged her vote the second
time, and nsked her: 'Are you a member ot

Then my daughter said, 'Excuse me, but I
shall have to challenge your vote.' She then
sat down, and said she was there for the pur
pose of acting as bodyguard to Mis- Cooper,
and that she intended to see that she received
her protection.
"Subsequently, on the morning of February

her tue question: 'Are you Mrs. Lena Blanch

Then my daughter and I stated to her that
as a matter, or act of courtesy, wo had called,
to .make sure that we were not mistaken, as to
her identity, as we were on our way to make
an affidavit before a notary public that she
had voted and that her vote had been chal
lenged. She acknowledged that she had
voted there, as Mrs. Cooper had urged
her to do so, and said, 'Why don't
you vote?' And Mrs. Blanchard further
stated that she certainly must have been hyp
noticed by Mrs. Cooper and that she was laDor

a church member, and that she knew she had
no right to vote, and, continuing, she said: 'I

was not too. late to do so yet, and that if she
felt she was in the wrong she should do so.

In an interview last nigh t Miss Hattie
Cooper stated tbat Mrs. Brown's agitation
over the Mrs. Blanchard episode was both
humorous and pathetic.
"Regarding the voting incident," said
she, "Mrs. Blanchard was at the prayer
meeting as a spectator, and being evi
dently of an excitable disposition was car
ried away, and when the members arose
for the vote she popped up too. It was
probably under the impulse caused by the
general movement of the people around
her. As she stood on her feet Bhe saw the
awful eye of Dr. Brown upon her, and
suddenly reminded that she was not a
member of the church she dropped in her
seat like a plummet.
"That is all there is in poor Mrs. Brown's
accusation of Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper's at
tempt to manufacture a vote against Dr.
Brown. My mother never in the slightest
tried to influence Mrs. Blanchard to vote,
and the statement that she did so is iidic
ulous.
"Last night about 9 o'clock Mrs. Blanch
ard came to our house and was in the
deepest trouble over Dr. Brown's visit to
her a few hours before. Ho descended
upon her with a notary public and de
manded that she sign a deposition or be
arrested for false voting at the prayer
meetiiig. He had engaged a stenographer
to take down her exact words and was
very much annoyed because that person
was late. Dr. Brown # in his impatience
stood out on the porch and wailed for the
shorthand man.
"Mrs. Blanchard told all this to U3, and
said: 'I didn't want Dr. Brown standing
on my front steps. lam a decent woman,
and I was afraid the neighbors would see
him. One of the principal ladies of his
church lives just across the street from
my house, and if she had seen him there
it "would have been bad for me.'
"I don't know where Mrs. Blanchard got
her idea of Dr. Brown's general baneful
inlluence," continued Miss Cooper, "but
Mrs. Blanchard s-eemed to be sincere in
her fears for her reputation andher regrets
at her visitor's public exhibition of himself
in that locality.
"She seems to be a poor, timid, nervous
woman and just the Derson that could be
intimidated into signing any paper, affida
vit or deposition Dr. Brown might offer.
We told her that Dr. Brown's threats of
ariest were all nonsense and she should
not pay any attention to them. She said
she would not be afraid and started home,
saying that she expected that the police
officers would be at her house waiting for
her return.
"As we have since heard that she and seve
ral of her friends have signed certain ridicu
lous depositions and statements, I pre
sume Dr. Brown aud his notary public and
his stenographer and his policemen breath
ine threats of arrest were waiting for the
poor woman when she got home."
It has been intimated that Dr. Brown on
thÂ£ strength of the affidavits procured by
his wife will ask the council not to admit
any testimony which might be offered by
Mrs. Cooper. This lady says, however,
that if such a course is followed the evi
dence in her possession will be given to
the public through the press.
There is a general belief among those
who have figured more or less prominently
in the case that the missing witness, Mrs.
Tnnnell, is in the City. Sne is said to be
in hiding, and only awaits the opening of
the council to make her presence known.
Professor Lloyd will occupy the pulpit

MRS, DAVIDSON IN COURT.
Her Attorneys Submit a Demur
rer to the Informa

Mrs. Davidson made her first appear
ance before the Superior Court yesterday.
She was arraigned before Judge Bahrs, but
instead of her plea a demurrer to the in
formation was filed by her attorneys, and
a greater part of the afternoon was spent
in arguing it.
The demurrer which Mr. Gallagher Â§nb
mitted was drawn up as follows:

a manner as to enable a person of common
intelligence to understand what is intended.
V.
That said Information Is not direct and cer

VI.
That the said information Is sot direot anÂ«

stances of the offense charged, the same being
necessary to constitute a complete defense.
VII.
lhat the facts stated in said Information do
not constitute a public offense.
VIII.
That the said information charges men than
one offense.
Walter Q allaqhzb and
J. J. Guilt oyle,
Attorneys for defendant.
Mr. Gallagher, in his argument, took
the position that Mrs. Davidson was an
agent, not a principal, and her acts could
not, therefore, be censured. He said, dur
ing his argument:
An agent cannot be convicted of a crime un
less it may be some violation of the rights of
his principal. The fact that the defendant
carried a verbal message to Dr. Brown does not
alter her character as agent. Would it be con
tended that if the message had been written
by Mrs. Baddin and had been conveyed to Dr.
Brown by Mrs. Davidson, Mrs. Davidson would
then be liable? Or suppose that the District
Attorney charged directly that defendant was
the agent of Mrs. Baddin in all that she said
or did. would there then be any doubts as to
the insufficiency of this information?
When a fact is alleged, which is capable of
two interpretations, one of which favors inno
cepce, the presumption favoring innocence
must be indulged in, for the law demands that
the presumption be always against the pleader.
When it is alleged that Mrs. Davidson declared
to Dr. Brown that she was the agent of Mrs.
Baddin, that declaration not being denied is
equivalent to a distinct allegation on the one
hand and an admission on the part of the
people that the defendant was the agent of
Mrs. Baddin, and so the court must conclude
how, as the agent of Mrs. Baddin, a conversa
tion she had with Mrs. Baddin was related to
Dr. Brown.
The prosecution has drawn from the facts
the conclusion that the defendant was not tha
agent of Mrs. Baddin, and the only way in
which they can hope to sustain the presump
tion.
If the doctor had feaTed Mrs. Davidson might
impute to him certain things, the imputation
should disclose that fact; and if the money was
given to Mrs. Davidson for herself, and not for
some other person, the pleader should so de
clare; and if the defendant had declared and
threatened that she would, if disappointed in
the financial venture, publish and impute to
Dr. Brown certain acts in which Miss Overman
figured, the information upon that point
should not be silent.
In fact, there should be no room for doubt
as to what the people charged in the informa
tion, and if there be any doubt the very oppo
site to the theory of the prosecution will be
presumed. Hence, because of the prosecution
failing to positively state certain facts, the
court must presume a state of facts as follows:
That the doctor did not fear tnat Mrs. Dav
idson would impute to him certain things if
she did not set $500; that she did not get any
money of any sum whatever for herself, and
that she was the agent of Jane Elizabeth Bad
din. Therefore, our conclusion being that de
fendant was an agent, the 'people in the in
formation have charged that defendant so
claimed, and the people have admitted that
claim by failing to deny It. While the deÂ«
fendant denies that she was the agent of Mrs.
Baddin, but was the agent of Dr. Brown, she is
not permitted to contradict the presumption
of the law from the allegations set but in this
information, but whatsoever horn of the di
lemma the people will hook onto tha defend
ant is proclaimed an agent.
An agent is not a principal. Our Civil Code.
section 2295, provides as follows: "An agent
is one who represents another, called the
principal, in dealing with third persons. Such
representation is called agency.
Walter Hinkle, Assistant District Attor
ney, and Davis Louderback, special coun
sel" for the prosecution, answered, Mr.
Hinkle following Mr. Gallagher. Mr.
Guilfoyle, Mr. Gallagher's associate, came
next with substantially the same argu
ments first made, and Mr. Louderback and
Gallagher closed.
Coupsel for the prosecution argued that
the law in reference to obtaining money
by false pretenses had been applied by the
defense to this case of extortion. It was
claimed that if a person went to another
and refusing to give names announced that
the unknown third party would tell that
â which would bring disgrace, the party so
threatening would be guilty of extortion.
The question of agency, it was argued, was
immaterial. Besides the prosecution did
not charge that Mrs. Davidson was an
agent. They accused her of being a prin
cipal.

FATHER YORKE TO
B, F, HUDELSON,
Continued from Sixth Page.
consider such a system a necessity. I have also
â (Tirade.) â  â¢
The question reads: "One general, non-secta
rinn system." The numeral "one" precludes
the support of other systems. Father Yorke
has said that he "believes in a free public
t-chool system" (see answer to Question C). He
has also'said that he believes ovk free public
bchooi system is a necessity" (see answer to
Question 14). But he has not said that he be
lieves in "supporting from : the public funds
oxe general, non-sectarian system." There
fore he has not answered my question, but -has
again dodged the Issue. fcffW
'. .'.>â ' qukstjot 27. â¢.
"Pops Mr. Yorke favor using public funds or pub
lic property for sectarian purposes, whether di
rectly or Indirectly?"
Yorkk's Answkrâ Neither directly nor indi
rectly flo I favor ukliir public fuudsor public prop
erty for sectarian purposes.
But if the State sees fit to pay for the main
tenance of Its wards at sectarian institutions, I do
not see why It should not do so. If Hie btate plnCes
b boy out with a farmer and pays for his clothes
and "his support, tne sÂ»tate is not contributing to
-tarian purposes. If the farmer's wife teaches the
boy to say bis prayers und read his Bible.
What a ridiculous statement! In one breath
Father Yorke makes the positive assertion that
"neither directly or indirectly does he favor
using public funds or publfc property for sec
tarian purposes." and with his next exbala-'
tion he declares: "But if the State Bees lit to
j)Â»y for the maintenance of its wards at sec
tarian institutions, 1 cannot see why it should
not *do so." Does Father Yorke intend to deny
tnat in the latter case the State would, by pay
ing a sectarian institution for the care of its
wards, thus be indirectly contributing to its
support?
The father coniiuues as argument: "If the
State places a boy out with a farmer and pays
(or his clothes and his Bupport, tne State is not
contributing to sectarian purposes, etc." I
â¢would like to ask Father Yorke at what period
in history the farmer became a "sectarian pur
pose?"
Father Yorke forgot to tack on to this answer
his usual tirade against the A. P. A.
qikstiox 28.
"Does Mr. York* oppose the taxation of all non
governmental property?''
Vobkk's Axs\vj:râ l have already answered tills
question.
I repeat now that if the State wishes to remit
the taxes of non-productive property, or even of
productive property, which it wishes 'to foster,
such remission Is notahvays against public policy.
1 tÂ»Â»'h case should be decided on its' merits. There
are no universal propositions in politics.
In his "reply" Father Yorke makes three
rtions.
.Firstâ "l have already answered this ques
tion.'' This is false. Reference to question l(>
will show that that is precisely %vhat he did
not do. He ridiculed certain ideas, and he
, 6tate4 his belief as to .the financial soundness
of Methodist Bishops. But the very thing he
did not dt> was to state whether he is or is not
hostile to the taxation of all non-governmental
property.
Secondâ This assertion is an unsupported
statement concerning sound public policy, and
â  may be relegated to the rubbish heap.
Thirdâ Father Yorke says, "There are no
universal propositions in politics." Possibly
not. Father Yorke, but there ate universal
propositions in justice. Yet I cannot accept
your dictum that "there are no universal
propositions in politics." Please produce your
oofs of this assertion, since you are ready to
prove all your statements. ,
In his answer to this question Father Yorke
.forgot to vituperate the A. I. A. The reply
scarcely sounds natural. l>id you really write
it yourself, father ?
QfESTION 29.
'â¢Does Mr. Yorke ojipo.se the public Inspection, of
all private schools, convents, nunneries, monas
t<>rn>s. sera inari and otf;er educational or char
itable institutions '.'"
Yokke's answkrâ Most certainly I do, and for
the very same reason thatÂ« I would obpose the in
spection of my home. ' Ji itny institution becomes a
public nuisance or a menace to tbe welfare of tlie
state there are laws vtiuuuh to suppress it without
having recourse to h smelling-committee.
If twenty ladies choose to live In a oomraunltv
I ilo not see why their privacy should be disturbed
as huic us hul! a iJozen can live- In a boarding
house and not be subjected to espionage.
Here Father Yorke, as usual, flies the track.
1 should like to ask him what resemblance a
seminary has to his home, that he should have
the same reason lor opposing the inspection oi
one thr.t he wouid have for opposing the in
spection of the other. .
Again Fstner Yorke says: If any institution
becomes a public nuisance or a menace to the,
â welfare of the State, there are laws enough to
suppress it without having recourse to a
smelling-committee." Father Yorke, who in
sinuated tbat any of the insinuations referred
to in my question were public nuisances oÂ»
menaces to the State? Who .-poke of suppress
' ing them? Or does their public inspection
necessarily involve their suppression? Lnd
by what rightdo you refer to a proposed pub
lic inspector as a. smelling-committee? Also ;
why ao you dra^ into the question the "twenty
Indies who may choose to live together?" Such
*n in-tinrion is *nrely not a seminary, mon
a-.ery, privai.choo! or other educational in
fciitotion. Why, iuen, do you infer that this
â principle is aimed only at convents and nun-
D >rieÂ«*T
And as a matter of fact are not "privato
schools, convents, nunneries, monasterie.',
teminaries or other edurational institutions"
institutions of a quasi-jiublic character ? And
as snch ought they not to t>e open to public in-
Bpection ?
To his answer to this qnestion Father Yorke
append! a nauseating tirade, the subject for
liis venom beittfc, as usual, the A. I. A. This
dtsgnstin; jratue oi. his, vilifying decent
peop'.e, muet carry it- own condemnation with
the public. And I have yet to see the first man
to consider him jmre, who. every time another
mentions "an institution where women live,
jumps, to the conclusion'that-that othgr is in
dulging in vile thought. "Honi soil gui raal
y pense !" .':â â¢"'; "â 
QtF-STION 3.
' "Does Mr. Yorke support for office any person
who recognize! aileiriance to any foreign or pcclesl
â stical' potentate as superior to our Government?"
iiRK)- â > asswkk - 1 haV'alreadv answered this
question. (Long tirade against thÂ»- A. P. A.)
Mr. Yorke states the thing that is not. He
has not answered this question. In Answer to
question. she stated that be considers it "un
wise to put in office men who owe allegiance to
a foreien power." But that does not state
â whether or not Father Yorke personally,*up
pbrts such men for oflice. He has dodged
again. , â¢
question SI.
â¢â¢Is Mr. Yorke in favor of eraming public lands
to other than actual settlers?"
Yorkk'k unvnM am not. I believe that those
who profit by the liberality of the Qovtnuneol
Bboold make return by cultivating Uie soil. (Tirade
acalr.st the a. p. A.)
Father Yorke then approves this principle of â¢
the A. P. A., and despite his almost endless vi
tuperation of the order we have found another,
bit ot common ground.
Mr. Editor: I have no time to-night for the
further consideration <>f Father Yorko's letter.
I have not .yet -id red his objections to
secrecy, and I desire' to show by the briefest
eynopsls of the points pone over" just what the
articles of disagreement are between the A. P.
A. and the Catholic church, or its representa
tives. The Sabbath, however.-is my day of
rest. I will, therefore, with 'your permission,
resume this communication on Monday. Yerv
respectfuilv, B. F. Hcdelson,
President of the A. F. A: of California.
LITTLE PETE ON A WHEEL
The Wily Mongolian Has Be
come an Enthusiastic
Bicyclist.
He Likes to Fly Through Golden Gate
Park With the Native
Riders,
Little PPte, the notorious Chinese poli
tician and highbinder "boss," has drifted
away from the society of his people in the
Chinese quarters and found new pleasures
in wheeling.
Little Pete has become an out and out
votary of the .bicycle. Already he prides
himself upon his facility of managing the
wheel, and is now cutting a wide dash
Kinong the bicyclists who daily frequent
Golden Gate Park.
His countrymen look on stolidly at his
performance, which, according to their
very conservative way of viewing innova
tions in anything, is regarded as extra
ordinary. That a follower of Confucius
should go whirling alone unon ji bicycle
is not, as a rule, considered just the proper
thing among the more steady going Mon
golians, so Little Pete has created quite a
stir in the Chinese quarter with his "bike"
and his fad.
Bui Little Fete, as on many a former oc
casion, ha? thus shown his desire to keep
from being commonplace. It mattered
little whether it was as a dictator among
highbinders, a -schemer to defeat the law,
or an imitator of the 'Melican man, he
manages to get there.
In the park nowadays ho is a conspicu
ous figure among wheelmen. He rides a
high-grade wheel of the latest pattern and
rides it well. He takes in the "Dull ring"
like all the other bicyclists and stretches
himself upon grassy banks for resi and a
sun bath.
The funny men among the other bicy
clists used to crack jokes at Little Pete's
expense, out that day is past now, for
the young men have had their nil of the
strange, canning Mongol.
â¢ The Chinese interloper in the "bull ring"
liglits'a cigarette, allows his queue to rly
backward in the wind and "digs" with an
ambition to give a display.
He usually â  appears in a soft hat of the
"slouch" variety, with \he rim pulled
down over his eyes, which are protected
by spectacles. As yet he has not adopted
tbe modern bicycle sweater, and is satis
lied with steel clasps around his blue
trousers abovje the ankle. The conven
tional Chinese shoe suits the pedal admira
bly.
Little Pete's favorite run is through the
park, once around the carriage concourse
near the music-suell and then out to the
Cliff and return. With his well-known
ability as a leader it is believed by men
who know him that Little Pete will soon
have a numerous following of Chinese
wheelmen.

IN A BLAZE OF RADIANCE.
The First Anniversary Ball of
the National Electrical
Workers.
Rarely Beautiful Display of Lights
Amid the Exquisite Floral
Decorations.
Over two thousand fairy lights of green
and gold and deep rich red, gleaming
amid festoons of verdure, gave to Odd
Fellows' Hall last night an aspect which
reminded one of some bright vista in
Aladdin's fabled palace. The National
Motherhood of Electrical Engineers, local
No. C, had evidently made up their minds
that their first anniversary ball should be
a brilliant affair in the way of illumina
tion as well as socially. In the center of
the hall hung a large circular corona so
ablaze with radiance as to leave the obser
ver in doubt as to the material which
formed its framework.
From this dazzling focus depended long
evergreens so spangled with electric lights
in every harmoniously contrasting shade
as to resemble strings of priceless gems.
The wall lights were half hidden from
view by nuge bunches of scarlet poppies,
and between eacn cluster hung long gon
falons of white and crimson sprinkled
with golden stars. Alone the galleries
were hangings of rose and azure ci*>oe de
Chine, caught up by garlands of natural
flowers. On the stage, surrounded by a
graceful drapery of crimson, was a shield
of smilax fully twenty feet wide, bearing
the initials of the brotherhood and the
word "Welcome" traced in letters of light
about a star of surpassing briliancy.
The dancing strains of Schubert's over
ture to "Les Dames de Seville," rendered
in spirited and artistic style by Hy lies'
Orchestra, soon merged into the yet "live
lier measure of Lysberg's "Valse dcs
Papillons," and the floor was soon a scene
of kaleidoscopic gayety. Between the
dances much amusement was afforded by
a number of phonographs stationed at
ONE OF THE CLEVER ELECTRICAL DEVICES AT THE BALL
[Sketched by a " Call " artist.}
near Stockton, of which Percy & Hamil
ton are architects, has been started by the
tiling of contracts, for foundations and
concrete work. It is to consist of six
stories and a basement of a total height
from the ground of eighty feet. It is de
signed for mercantile purposes, although
it is so arranged that it may be very easily
finished up as an office building.
The front, on Post street, is 67:6 wide
and is to be constructed up to the sixth
story of stone. Above that is a mansard
roof constructed of copper and slate. The
side wall and frontace on Morton street,
to which street it extends a distance of 120
feet, will be built of brick. The inside
structural work consists of iron columns
various points in the hall in charge of sev
eral of the pillars of the brotherhood.
The success of the affair was due in great
part to the painstaking labors of t tie vari
ous committees, whicij were composed of
the following-named gentlemen:
Committee of arrangementsâ A. F. Irvine
(chairman), E. Rush, W. L. Bentley. C. E.
Hasten, H. Kenny, C. M. Little, W. N. Man
ning.
Floor manajrorâ 0. E. Hasten ; assistant floor
malinger â A. Sonfcer.
Floor committeeâ F. Throckmorton, Tt. At
wood, R. B. Bennett, I. I'oterson, F. Severs, J.
Gilkyson.
Xi ivj-tion committeeâ R. B. Porter, W.
Forest, G. P. Manning, F. Koons, J. R, Fulton,
L. Kruger. J. Camerron. S. M. Keeble, elec

STRUCK HIS VOCATION.
An Aged Negro Tells How He Came to
Bo v Sigii-Faihter.
All "artist sign-pairiters" will now have
to Jook to their laurels, for there is a new
rival in the field. He does business under
the name of Albert Hepburn, and was
born in the South of pood old African
stock. That was over eighty years ago,
and since then Albert has worked at many
trades, from cotton-picking to preaching.
He says that he did uretty well at all of
them, but never found his real mission in
life until he took to sign-painting.
The way that Albert came to discover
his talent was by posing for an artist who
was painting a picture with an old negro
for one of the figures. As soon as Albert
entered the studio he felt as if he had
found what he had always sought. He
asked many questions while there, and
when he left was presented with a dis
carded sketch box, a few tubes of color
and some brushes.
His first work was to paint his name on
the box. He did it so well that he thought
he had better make a business of sign
painting, and, accordingly, added the rest
of the inscription. He apologizes for pet- i
ting the "s" in the word "artist" turned
and steel girders for carrying the various
floors.
The foundation is of the cantilever con
struction, the cantilevers being con
structed of concrete, with twisted iron rods
imbedded in them to give them the neces
sary tensile strength.
The principal entrance in the center of
the Post-street facade will be made a
special feature, and be elaborately finished
in granite and marble.
No interior decorations will be included
in the present contracts until it is defi
nitely decided to what uses the building is
to be put.
The estimated cost of the structure com
plete is $70,000.
backward by sayinc that it was the first
time he had" made the letter.
It has been a couple of months since
Albert started out in business, and he now
has a large number of customers in differ
ent parts of the City. His principal work
is making signs for "ladies' v who take in
washing. If they just want the words
"washing and ironing" he charges 25
cents, provided they furnish the board.
The Sign Artist Ready for Work.
[Sketched from life oy a '''Call" artist.]
If the name of the proprietor is wanted
there is an additional charge of 15 cents.
Even at this modest sum Albert says he
makes a good living, much better than he
could at cleaning windows, and he is his
own boss.
Albert does not boast of a place of busi
ness just yet, but goes out with his box
every day and makes personal calls on his
customers. He has done a large amour.t
of work in the vicinity of Sacramento and
Lravenworth streets, but says his best
efforts have been made near his own home
at North Beach. He has also done some
fine work in the Potrero, and says he made
a sign for a dressmaker that" any artist
might be proud of.
Albert's method of working is simple.
He takes an ordinary smooth board and
rubs a coatine of turpentine and white
lead over it, that dries in a few minutes,
and then starts m with the letters in any
color paint the customer desiTes. He does
not attempt to "space" his letters, but gets
his board long enough in the first place,
and then saws off what is not wanted
after the line is finished. While at work
Albert is surrounded by all the children in
the neighborhood, and they do not seem
to bother him in the least. He proudly
explains bis methods to them as he goe"s
along, and tells them that they may be
able fo do as well when they .grow up if
they behave themselves and "study their
lessons.
A RELIC OF THE PAST.
Slab From the Old California The
ater In a cig.'ir-
Store.
Fred Homer, proprietor of a cigar-store
on Bush street, near Dupont, is the owner
of the stone slab that was once over the
main doorway of the old California Thea
ter. The slab has been put in a frame
under a cabinet of cigar boxes, and in such
a position as to be plainly visible to pedes
trians passing down the street.
Ttie slab came into the possession of the
present owner at the time the old theater
was torn down in 1888. He s.iw it in a pile
of rubbish about to be carted away, and
asked for it. Mr. Homer had a double
reason for desiring the slab. In the first
place he was much attached to the old
theater and in the second place the date on
the sfab was the same as the year in which
he arrived in San Francisco^
The sliib is a fine piece of marble, and
has the words, "Bush street, 18G-S" deeply
carved on the surface. The slab has been
in its present position for eight years, and
is likely to remain there a good while
longer. It attracts a great deal of atten
tion from passersby.

The Talk of Cats.
Cats differ as much as human beings in
the quality of their voices and in their
talkativeness, and as far as my observa
tion goes, the finest bred have the least to
say. Princess and her immediate de
scendants were talkers; they always
mewed for what they wanted, and in
response to a greeting or question; and
they asked many questions, the drift of
which we could not always catch, with
unmistakable interrogation in the tone-
She and 'M'liss, who was a chatterbox
after her kind, both had a habit of making
little conversational sounds in the throat
as many dogs have, especially when mucn
petted; they would keep up this sotto
voce communication for ten or fifteen
minutes, much to our perplexity, though
it sometimes evidently expressed'affection
or a wish for sympathy. They had great
variety of inflections in talking to their
kittens, and many of them were tender
and even musical, like the chirp of a bird â

Carried Top Weight in the
California Stake and Won
Handily.
CASPAR A SPEEDY YOUNGSTER.
George Miller, the "Kansas City Hin.
doo," Won the Special Race
for Sprinters.
With a day not unlike the hazy weather
of an Indian summer in the Eastern
States, visiting horsemen found it difficult
to imagine th:u they were racing in the
midst of winter. It was an ideal racing
day, and the cars conveying passengers to
lngleside were crowded. The card was
one of the best offered at the meeting. In
addition to the usual routine of flat rsces
the California stake for "lepper6," two
miles over eight hurdles, with a guaran
teed value of $1200 to the tirst horse, was
run.
There was no apparent scarcity of coin,
for the sixteen bookmakers in the big bet
ting-ring all did a rushing business. Fa
vorites carried off tne laurels in three out
of the six events, ana as the other winners
all ran backed the talent had a fairly suc
cessful day of it.
Four of the fields were dispatched by the
Australian starting machine, and it is safe
to predict that long, tedious delays at the
post are a thing of the .past: The
t*cven starters in the two-year-old event
were sent away ;o a beautiful start in ex
actly two minutes.
The stake race was third on the card,
fct. Brandon, carrying top weight, 165
pounds, was favorite in the betting at 9 to
5. Taylor's pair, Bellringer and Carmel,
Lad second call, with the Corrigau entries,
Contentment and Bedford, third in dc>
niand. J0 C and Janus were the other
6tarters.
1 here was some delay at the t>ost, caused
by the unruly actions of Carmel and Bell
ringer. When Caldwell rinally dropped
ig Spence on Bellringer was quickest
away, and cleared the first jump in ad
vance of the others. Soon joined oy Con
tentment, Bellringer and the Corrigan
horse showed the way fora mile and three
quarters. As the stretch was reached the
second time, Boyd, astride the favorite,
made his b:d, and as the iast jump was
reached the bright green jacket of St.
â¢on was in front. John Brenocks
line jumper stumbled after making the
Hurdle, but Boyd quickly caught him,
and drawing away from Beliringer beat
him easiiy by four lengths.
Ten or fifteen lengths away Content
â¢ and J O C fought it out for the show,
mer getting it by a head. The win
lipped three-quarters of a second off
oast record, covering the distance in
stable of Burns & Waterhouse un

in the defeat of the 8 to 5 favorite

he was beaten out a neck by the 15 to
â¢ Wyoming, splendidly ridden by
Macklin. Don Pio Pico, a 100 to 1 chance,
was a good third.
The special rive-furlong dash, with that
speedy quartet, George Miller, DerfargiJla,
Moboi.-.^ca and Pat Murphy, as starters,
resulted in another winning bracket for
the "Kansas City Hindoo? 1 Pittsburg
I'nii's mare was a warm 6 to 5 favorite in
tne ring, with Miller closing second choice,
half a point lower than Mobolasca.
Pat Murphy's odds were played down
from 40 to 12 to 1. The start was not one
of Caldweii's best efforts. George Miller
was away in front, and never headed, won
as he pleased from Mobalasoa, who was
tnree lengths before Derfargilla.
The fifth race, over seven furlongs, ended
in a rather easy win for Sea Spray, who
went to the post 4 to 1. and making the
running from the jump, won by a length
from Fortuna. Moliie R, (be 13 to 5 favor

The concluding event of the day was an

WEAVER AGAIN.
The Board of Health Making Another
Investigation of the Superintend
ent of the Aluiihouge.
For the past week the Board of Heath
has been holding a secret invebtigation of
P. L. Weaver, superintendent of the Alms
house. He is charged with sins of commis
sion and sins of omission of a serious
nature. The matter is being vigorously
pressed by Drs. Hart, Morse and Fitzgib
bon, the three Democratic members of the
board, who would like to see Ed Ready,
Governor Budd's choice for the superin
tendency of the Almshouae, occupying the
place now filled by Mr. Weaver.
Dr. Williamson supports Mr. Weaver,
who is a Republican. Already Mr. Weaver
has been questioned. He denies all the

charees of his enemies. Those who have
testified against him so far are Charley H.
Lane, present laundry man; Dr. William E.
Conlan, resident physician; Colonel F. B.
McClung, clerK; P. F. Kearney, cook; R.
P. Julian, head tanner ana assistant super
intendent; Jeremiah Caddy, ambulance
driver; John Boylt. former clerk, and Dr.
E.L. Parramore, former resident physician.
There are many more witnesses to be
heard. Dr. Williamson wants to hear Mr.
Weaver s rebuttal testimony before bring
ing in a decision.
The charges are of a most sweeping and
positive nature. They range from neglect
ing to oversee the building to the levying
of an assessment on the employes* for
political purposes and holding back money
from the Public Administrator, till a nurse
with a grievance makes the matter public
two years and rive months after the mans
death.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1596.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT.
Three " Wind -Jammers" Being
Fitted Out for a Cruise
to the Arctic.
WHICH WILL BE THE WINNER?
Captain Foley of the Gayhead Expects
to Equal the Best Steamer
Catch.
Captain Charles H. Foley, who goes out
in command of the whaler Gayhead, has
received the best "lay" of any officer who
has yet shipped for the next cruise to the
Arctic. He is one of tne best-known
masters on the water front, and during
the last cruise of the old Bounding Billow
he took eleven wbaies and thus established
a record for a "wind-jammer." Since then
he has on several occasions been offered
the command of a steam whaler, but he
has invariably refused on the ground that
his luck was better in a sailing vessel.
"I will take my wife and boy with me,"
1 said Captain Poley yesterday. "The lad is
I now 8 years old, and, ns his mother is
; going to keep school aboard every day, he
j will not lose anything in the shape of edu
i cation. Before our trip to the Arctic is
j completed I think the boy will know as
i much about whaling as I do. From San
j Francisco we will go to Kodiak, and from
i there to Bristol Bay. At the latter point
we will take in our new supply of stores,
and then we will not be heard from again
I except by an occasional letter, an we will
! remain in the ice for two years. When
1 the Gayhead returns to San Francisco in
1898, I think you will find that I have
made a better catch than I did on the
: Bounding Billow."
The whaling brig Hidalgo has changed
j hands. Captain Louis â¢ Williams, her
owner ha? sold an interest in the vessel,
and Captain C. F. Gifford will go out in
command. Captain Gifford is now the
principal owner, and intends taking the
vessel direct to the Arctic in search of
bow heads. Incidentally he will do con
siderable trading. Like Captain Foley,
Captain Gifford has been remurkably suc
cessful, and expects to do well in his new
venture.
The whaler Emma F. Herriman has also
changed hands. Captain C. J. Jorgenson
has purchased ncr from John Magee Jr.,
and she will at once be placed !n commis
sion. All three vessels will go out at
about the same time, and as all are "wind
jammers" there is considerable excitement
along the front as to which will make the
best catch.
The steamer Gaeilic sailed for the Orient
yesterday. Wong Say YunÂ«, one of the
women whom See Gee attempted to land,
was returned, and sailed for Hongkong on
the steamer. The otlaer passengers were:
For Yokohamaâ Dr. George L. Tait, Mrs.
George L. Tait, L. <J. Putnam, Henry Portal,
Pierre Roussillier, Francis B. Peabody, Augus
tus F. Peabouy, Edwin P. Bradbury, (ioro

licher Konsul), Dr. Lucy H. Hoag, Mis* Laura
A. Ilaygood, Miss Millie Munroe. For Hong
kongâK. J. Bates, E. K. Vail, Key. Lewis
Quick, Captain Felipe S. Meza.
The Alaska Commercial Company's
Bertha arrived from Alaska yesterday.
Captain Hayes is almost a cripple, as he
fell and sprained both his ankles at Una
laska. Among the passengers were a crew
of disheartened miners, who have very
little to say about the result of their labors
on the Yukon. The severity of the cli
mate, they say, was the cause of all their
trouble. The gold was there all right, but
the ice and snow made work almost im
possible. The Bertha brought a very large
shipment of gold dust, consigned to Louis
Sloss & Co.
There was trouble at Broadway wharf
when the steamer City of PuebJa was dock
ing yesterday. The law .says that runners
shall not approach within ten feet of the
edge of a <vharf at which a vessel is dock
ing, and the men overstepped the bounas.
In consequence, John Buckley, A. R. Da
ley, T. W. Brooks and Thomas Whalen
were arrested by Sergeant Fitzsribbon and
charged at the Harbor police station. The
fitiht is a continuation of the old one be
tween the Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany and the runners employed by Mor
ton's Special Delivery. On this occasion
it appears as though the runners would get
the worst of it.
RE-REGISTRATION OF VOTERS.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald Has Ren
dered an Important Opinion.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald has ren
dered an important opinion relative to reg
istration in the counties. It was given in
response to a letter of inquiry from the
District Attorney of Butte County, who
wanted to know if it would be necessary
for the voters to re-register before the next
election, or if a supplemental register
would meet the requirements of the law.
Many such letters have recently baen re
ceived by the Attorney-General.
The latter is of the opinion that owing to
certain important changes in the registra
tion laws of the State made by the lust
Legislature it will be necessary for the
Board of Supervisors throughout the State
to order a re-registration of the voters in
the several counties and that a sup
plemental register will not meet the re
quirements of the law.
The changes mentioned refer to the iden
tification of voters and the marking of bal
lots by those who cannot read or write, or
who are unable to mark their ballots by
reason of physical inrirmities.
The present law in this respect differs
from the old one in stating that the voters
thus afflicted must have that fact appear
on tue register. Formerly this was not
necessary and the afflicted voter could
have his ballot marked by one of the judges
of election.
The law provides that in all counties ex
cepting the City and County of San Fran
cisco Boards of Supervisors may order a
re-registration before a general election.
In San Francisco this must be done. On
account of the amendments and changes
Mr. Fitzgerald believes that re-registra
tion is now necessary in all the counties.
WHERE BREAD IS MADE.
The Labor Commissioner Has Exam
ined Many Very Filthy
Bakeries.
Shortly after Labor Commissioner Fitz
gerald entered upon the duties of his office
he made an investigation of the bakeshops
and bakeries of this City, with a view of
learning of the condition of those who la
bored therein. In order to effect his pur
pose he was obliged to iook into the sani
tary conditions. Many were found to be
as neat as a pin, but they were principally
the larger institutions. The small baker
ies, as a rule, were simply shocking. Kan
cid grease, aged eggs and decayed fruit, all
too foul to be used, were in many places
I piled in barrels in close proximity to the
materials being made into articles of food.
The air in many of these places was so
! foul as to be an actual menace to the
j health of those employed. In not a few
I places the workmen were obliged to sleep
on the premises, in which, as a rule, sani
tary plumbing was unknown. A number
! of the operatives themselves were not in
I good health, as evidenced from the appear
ance of their cuticle.
The orieinal reports of these places,
! which were presented by the comrnission
i ers' field deputies, would have caused
| almost all consumers of bread and pastry
to have made their own or gone without. *
However, those reports were never
made public; but from what can be
learned the adverse reports referred to
the majority of the bakeries in this City.
The Labor Commissioiifir warned the man
agers of those places to put their premises
in order, but whether the bakers have
done so or not is not learned.
The Commissioner proposes to issue a
card, or certificate, to all who have com
plied with the sanitary laws, in order that
the public may be informed of the char
acter of the places where they purchase
their bread and similar food.
FOR THE RESERVE.
The Old Monitor Coiuanche Detailed
for the Use of the Naval
Battalion.
Governor Budd last night received a
piece of news from the Navy Department
which will be glad tidings for the Naval
Reserve of California. It is no less than
the notification that the old monitor Co
manche, now lying at Mare Island, would
be turned ovdr to the State authorities at
the requisition of the Governor.
This old vessel which haa been in the
stream off the navy-yard for many years,
is a stanch craft, and if two modern rifles
are nut in her turret in place of the old
15-inch smoothbores she will be a
useful practice monitor for the Naval
Battalion. She has five inches of armor
belt and her turret is ten inches in thick
ness, and she is no mean craft in a right.
Her length is 200 feet, with forty-rive leet
beam, and she draws eleven feet of water.
The engines are in good condition, and
will drive her six knots an hour.
MONOWAI ARRIVES.
The Oceanic Steamship From Australia,
New Zealand, Apia and Honolulu
si".;.* Into Fort This Morning.
At 1 o'clock this morning the lookout at
Point Lobos reported that the Oceanic
steamship Monowai was passing in the
Golden Gate.
The big steamship comes from Austra
lia, New Zealand, Apia and Honolulu.
She is in command of Captain Carey. She
was due at 10 o'clock Thursday, but no
alarm was felt as to her belated appear
ance, as it was shrewdly believed that she
had encountered head winds in her pas
sage %;ross the Pacific.
Berkeley Surprise Party.
One of the pleasant events of the week was a
surprise party given to Mr. and Mrs. M. Mc-
Donald of Berkeley by Neil Lindsay, the popu
lar Scotch piper, and a number of friendÃ of
San Francisco. Dancing and singing were the
order of the evening. Among those present
besides the host and hoatuss and their daugh
ters weâ¢ the Misses McLeilan, Miss Sydney,
Mr. and Mrs. Carnie, Mr. and Mrs. Grant, Mr.
and Mrs. M. Ferguson, Mrs. M. Neil, Mrs. Mc-
Lfillan and Messrs. Neii Lindsay, D. McLellan,
Beaton and McDonald.
Miss Cullen Removes.
Miss Cullen, tha well-known employment
agent, lor the past five years doing business at
105 Stockton street, hns been compelled on
account of the increase in her business, to re
move her office to more commodious quarters.
She cau hereafter be found at 323 Sutter street,
first floor, where she will be pleased to see all
her old customers.
GEORGE RAPHAEL RETURNS
Back From New York With All
Sorts of Interesting
News.
OPPOSED TO THE FUNDING BILL.
Eastern People Are for McKinley and
Would Like Also to See Collis
Put Up.
George Raphael of the firm of Raphael
Brothers has just returned from a four
weeks' business trip to New York. He
was seen at his residence last night by a
representative of The Call, and seemed
to be extremely glad to get back.
"When the train came over the moun
tains and I saw California just beginning
to come into the spring mouths, I felt that
I was passing once again into the land of
sunshine," said Mr. Raphael. "When i
came through Ohio a frightful blizzard
was blowing, and it made me appreciate
the comforts of California weather all the
more.
"From a business standpoint, however,
the East is brightening up a little, not
withstanding the fact that they have had
a good many more failures there than we
have had here. To a certain extent trade
is slow, but not so weak as it has been.
One thing I noticed particularly, and that
was the strength of the mining business.
It seems to be steadily improving, and
Eastern capital is ready to invest in Cali
fornia gold-raining. The moneyed men
of New York want such investments, and
are reaching out In all directions for them.
"Yes, the bond issue was looked upon'as
a dubious proceeding, as it was feared
that they could not be disposed of, but
Morgan seemed to be ready to "gatner the
bonds in. There is a pretty good feeling
East for Californians and they are wel
comed very warmly. New Yorkers are
beginning to recognize San Francisco and
this coast as a very considerable part of
ihe United States, and the old method of
looking upon California people as wild
and woolly children of the West is a thing
of the past. There are a great many
Western people in New York, and they
are pretty generally successful.
"You would be surprised to hear how
very seriously the funding bill is consid
ered in the Eastern States. It is a constant
theme of conversation on railroad trains
and at places where people from all the
Union are likely to congregate, and not
one man in a hundred is friendly to the
measure. The general impression is that
Huntington has had about enough of the
blood of the West, and it is hoped that the
Union Pacific and the Central Pacific will
pass into the hands of the Government.
I learned shortly after my arrival that I
had been quoted in the Washington Post
as being very friendly to the funding bill
and had expressed the Delief that its
passage would be the best way out of the
difficulty. I want it distinctly understood
that I am opposed to it in any conceivable
form and tnat I would give most anything
to see Huntington brought up to the issue
and made to pay his debts to the Govern
ment.
"The Presidential boom is all for Mc-
Kinley. Even in New York, which ouaht
to be a Morton State, I found that the
name of MeKinley was on everybody's
lips. Reed is not discussed favorably to
any great extent, nor is Allison. So far
as the Democratic party is concerned, 1
was unable to find anybody who wanted
to talk of it at all. There is a very large
disgust on in the East over the antics of
Cleveland, and MeKinley is looked upon
as the logical candidate for the Repub
lican party and the most available man to
lead the campaign.
"War talk is never heard and seems to
be confined solely to a few alarmists who
are ready to howl at a moment's notice.
Business men generally consider war a
bad thing, and it rinds no place in the con
versation of Easterners."
HONOR TO ADAM SMITH.
A Handsome Bronze Bunt of Him Pre
sented to the Red Men.
The bronze heroic-sized bust of Adam
Smith, the founder in this State of the
Improved Order of Red Men. was unveiled
and formally presented to the Grand
Lodge of that order last night in Red
Men's Hall at 320 Post street.
A. Andrews, the great prophet, deliv
ered the invocation, following which there
was an ode by a male quartet. C. F.
Burgman, grand chief of records, read the
report of the memorial committee, and
Benjamin F. Josselyn, past grand sachem,
made an address formally delivering the
bust to the great sachem, A. Jackson, who
unveiled the handsome piece of sculpture,
which was draped with a garland of flow
ers, and presented it to the order. There
was next a "song of exaltation" by a
quartet, and then Davis Louderback de
livered an eloquent eulogy on the man
whose memory the order delights to honor.
The bust is the product of Rupert
Schmid. and will be placed in the vestibule
of the Red Men's building on Post street.
Masked Ball of the (.rut 1 i Vorein.
Saratoga Hall was the scene la3t night of the
twenty-second annual masquerade ball given
by the San Francisco GrutJi Verein. There was
ii Rood attendance, the music was excellent
and the costume of the participants varied aud
pleasing.

POLICE COURT CONTEMPT
The Opposition to Judge Wood
Is of Three Years'
Standing.
COURT'S LEGALITY DOUBTED.
Ex-Mayor Chapman Will Seek to
Have the Supreme Court
Upset Wood.
Oakland Office Sax Fhaxcisco Call,)
â¢ 90S Broadway, Feb. 15. f
The recent cases of contempt in the
rohce Court have taken on a new interest
by the proceedings instituted by ex-Mayor
M. C. Chapman, who is the attorney for a
binaman now in prison for violating the
lottery laws. Mr. Chapman has prepared
a case that will be brought up on habeas
corpus proceedings. H fc contends that the
\\ hitney act. which created the present
Oakland Police Court, is invalid, and
that Judge Wood is not. therefore, the
legal occupant of the bench. On this
ground Attorney Chapman will apply for
the Chinaman's release, and if the
Superior Court denies the writ, he will at
once ko before the Supreme Court. .
Tne war against the police court and its
present occupant is of longstanding. It
began when Attorney Chapman was
Mayor. Police Judge Ogden was elevated
to the Superioi Court about three years
neo. Mayor Chapman appointed John
t Sands to the oflice and the Supervisors ap
pointed Fred V. Wood, the incumbent,
who was re-elected. There was a right for
the office, and eventually the Supreme
Court seated Wood. Ever" since that time
there has been a conflict. Attorney Chap
man handles the bulk of the Chinese
lottery cases, and in several instances jury
trials have been denied and appeals have
been taken. Recently the Supreme Court
sustained Wood, and the movo to have the
police court declared illegal is the latest
effort of Attorney Chapman to undo the
work of the Supreme Court of a year ago.
The many attempts to destroy the
foundation of the court's dignity has had
a marked effect on some of the attorneys
practicing before Judge Wood. hey have
concluded that he 18 arbitrary, and do not
hestitate to show their feeling.
Two months ago Attorney i'hil Walsh
â¢was adjudged to be in contempt by Judge
Wood, and Walsh claimed mat it* was all
due to prejudice, because he had issued a
circular denouncing Jud^e Wood as a
member of ihe A. P. A. when he (Welsh)
was dismissed from his post as official
stenographic reporter of the Police Court.
Walsti beat his contempt case on habeas
corpus proceedings, as Judge Wood pro
nounced judgment irregularly.
Yesterday â¢ Attorney Garritv, who
handles nearly all the liquor-license in
fringers, had a tilt with Judge Wood.
There have been several little spats be
tween Wood and Garrity because of the
Judge refusal to aIIQW juries in misde
meanor cases, and appeals are now rend
ing. Garrity's habeas corpus case wili be
tried on Monday morning, and there is
some speculation as to the result. Follow
ing will come the proceedings on behalf of
the Chinaman by ex-Mayor Chapman, by
which he hopes to have the court declared
as having no legal existence.
The legal advisers of the Judge lau<;h. at
the proposed proceedings, and say without
hesitancy that there has never been a more
upright man on the bench, and that tbe
only opposition to him originates with
certain powerful interests in the city to
whom indulsrences are denied and whose
animus is of a political nature.
It Came to Naught.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 15.â District At
torney Snook has decided that there is no
reasonable ground for instituting proceed
ings against Mayor Davie for violating the
purity of election law.
It was represented to the District Attor
ney that in the statement of election ex
penses filed by John L. Davie on the 22d
of March, 1595, he swears that $S4 had
been paid for watchers at the polls after
the election. James Hopkirk, a member
of the City Central Committee, stated that
â¢ the money for this purpose was paid to
him by Eugene Hough some tiniein April
subsequent to the date that Davie swore
that he had paid the same, and that
Houg!) stated that he had got the money
from Sheriff C. B. White, who put it up
for Davie. This would bring tbe payment
outside of the period prescribed by law
within which election bills may be paid.
Mayor Davie' has shown his vouchers to
tbe District Attorney, and that official has
decided that there is no cause for com
lint.

Redrield asked the court to approve a con

attorneys advance all costs, conduct the
case and'take oqe-third of the first $10,000
and one-fourth of any further payment.
Judgment was given for $14,000 ana $175

death of the plaintiff's wife in a streetcar
accident. By this arrangement the at
torneys receive $4333.

READY TO RE-REGISTER.
Work on Alameda's New Great
Register Will Begin To-
Morrow.
As Theie Is No Money for Help, the
Affidavits Will Be Prepared
by Volunteers.
Oakland Office San Feaxcisco Call,!
908 Broadway, Feb. 15. (
The re-registration of voters of Alameda
County will commence on Monday next.
A long list of deputies has been appointed
by County Clerk Jordan, embracing every
town and city in the county, and a more
systematic method has never been known.
The Clerk returned to-day, after having
been occupied for an entire week swearing
in reliable deputies who have volunteered
to do the work. In former years the posi
tion of a registration deputy has been
looked upon as a political snap, but owing
to the absence of a clause in the new act
providing for extra compensation the
clerk has no fund at his disposal.
"There will be no difficulty in making a
register that will be one of the cleanest
and best the county has ever had," said
Mr. Jordan. "I am now making arrange
ments for handling the registration affida
vits that will reduce the chances of fraud
to a minimum. They will be arranged in
wards and precincts, so that I will be able
to keep at my lingers' ends the exact con
dition of affairs as they progress."
The opinion of the District Attorney
that no financial aid can legally be ex
tended to the clerk has been accepted by
Mr. Jordan, and he has arranged every
thing accordingly, and he anticipates
nothing mo*e serious than several months
of hard work for himself and deputies.
More than 150 deputies will be placed in
the field when all appointments have
been made.

The mother had scarcely withdrawn
when she was summoned back by the
triumphant photographer, who exhibited
a satisfactory negative.
When they reached home the mother
asked: "Nellie, what did the man say to

THE SAN IKAISCISCO CALL, SUKDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1896.
DRIVEN FROM THE TOWN.
Oakland Residents Well Know
the Band That Killed
Fountain.
WEKE PROTECTED BY TROOPS.
Experience of an Editor Who Tried to
Run a Paper in the Cowboys'
District.
Oakland Office Pas Francisco Call,)
<JOB Broadway, Feb. 15. [
The kidnapping and murder of Colonel
Fountain of Las Cruces, N, Mex., is, ac
cording to trie story told by some residents
of Oakland, who were driven from that
town a few months ago, not an uncommon
experience in that district.
The Oakland party consisted of Mrs.
Mary E. Linde, a journalist from Hot
Springs, Ark., and her son-in-law, George
Mockwitz, wife and cnild.
Mr. Mockwitz is a geologist and mining
prospector and had gone to Lincoln
County from Paris, Texas, for the purpose
of prospecting, prepared to locate claims
lor himseif aud a rich Danish syndicate.
He found the country rich in minerals,
bnt the environments so dangerous that
he could not remain there with safety to
himself and family.
Mrs. Linde was offered the only print
ing office at Lincoln free if she would con
duct a weekly county paper. This offer
appeared generous, considering the fact
that it contained presses and type to the
value of several thousand dollars and that
the advertisements amounted to $250
monthly, at the rate of $10 an inch for
advertisements, from the cattle-ranchers,
known as '"brand ads," showing each
rancher's cattle-brand.
This appeared to be a grand offer until
it was discovered that no man had yet run
a paper acceptable to the cowboy element.
The last editor had had his nerves shat
tered by the actions of a band who had
taken offense at some news published.
Instead of culling for a retraction they
took tiie law into their own hands, rode
up to the office, opened a fusillade of pistol
shots, pied the type and scared the editor
aud staff into suspending publication â a
very wise precaution under the circum
stances.
It was Boon learned that strangers were
not welcome unless they would fall in
with the clique of cowboys that ran the
town, and Mr. Mockwhz was not one of
tneir set, so they determined to annoy
him. They took possession of his valuable
horses, and confiscated whatever they
could lay their hands on.
The birth of a little daughter in his
family compelled him to remain at Lin
coln two months, while he felt that his
life was not safe.
In the meantime Mrs. Linde bad written
articles for a paper at "White Oak in New
Mexico, a more civilized country, in
which she showed up the doings of the
j so-called cowboys, which this lady says
! are not the class general ly known at) cow-
I boys, but renegades of Texas, New Mexico
and all Western States. These articles
found their way back to Lincoln, making
her position as dangerous as that of
Colonel Fountain.
The cowboys swore that the family
should never leave Lincoln, and neither
could they until a message reached Fort
Stanton, ten miles distant, asking protec
tion for themselves. Captain Burbank re
sponded, and troops were sent over to
escort Mrs. Linde and the Mockwitz fam
ily safely to Fort Btanton, where they re
mained a short while, and later on were
protected by the Government troops over
a stretch of 140 miles to the railroad sta
tion en route to California.
In speaking of the experience Mr. Mock
witz says that he has traveled all over
America and Europe, but never encoun
tered a class of people so wholly lawless
and defiant as these outlaws, who are
called cowboys, which is a decided mis
nomer, for they are not like the cowboys
of Texas and elsewhere, but a lot of men
who recognize no laws but their own, and
revenge every real or fancied wrong with
terrible punishments, regardless of life.
The population of Lincoln is not over
1000 inhabitants, and the law-abiding citi
zens are greatly in tne minority, standing
in abject fear of the class that murdered
Colonel Fountain.

A SCHOOL POE MONKEYS.
An Institution Where They Are Taught
to Spell With Blocks.
There has just been founded at Calcutta
an institution for the education of mon
keys, says the Paris Journal dcs Debats.
Probably the prime movers of the affair
never heard of Professor Garner, the cele
brated American simiologist, who has
again gone to Africa to make an ex
haustive study of the language of mon
keys, or else they have deemed it easier to
teach the monkeys than to learn from
them in simian tongue. At any rate, one
of the methods employed in this strange
educational institution is the following:
A young monkey is taken and before
him is placed a set of blocks, on which are
painted in capitals the letters of tbe alpha
bet. These blocks are, in fact, exactly
similar to those which children play with
in every civilized country in the world,
and they are used in precisely the same
way as the monkey were a younir speci
men of the human race. There is one pro
fessor for each monkey, and the monkey is
taught by means of the blocks to spell cer
tain words. If the word is "fruit," for ex
ample, the monkey, after having been
taught to arrange the blocks so as to spell
the word quickly and without error, re
ceived a bit of fruit as his reward. The
same exercise is repeated with other
words, and it is hoped that in time the
simians will learn how to read and spell
and understand English if they cannot
speak it.
Only young animals are taken, for they
learn more quickly than old ones. There
is no danger of this queer school lacking
scholars, for there are thousands of
monkeys to be found in that part of India
where Calcutta is situated. An effort will
also be made, it is said, to educate these
beasts so that they may become fairly
efficient domestic servants. The school is
so young as yet, however, that what it
will accomplish is entirely a matter of
speculation. Its "professors" are enthu
siastic about their novel work, and seem
to think that a new field of usefulness will
soon be opened up for these chattering
little beasts.
ALAMEDA MILK ANALYSES
Dairymen Protest Against Hav
ing Records Bulletined
Weekly.
Charles Keller Sues for Divorce Be
cause He Was Deserted by
Wife and Family.
ALAMEDA. Cal., Feb. 15.â The milk
men who supply Alameda, at least those
j who are engaged extensively in the busi
ness, are going to object strenuously to the
setting up of a bulletin board in the rooms
of the Board of Health, whereon to chron
icle from week to week the result of tests
of the milk supply, as samples of the same
are taken from the cans that customers are
served from. It is represented that big
dairies, where the product of many cows
is mixed, will not hold its own alongside
of the product of one or two cows, kept by
the man who owns a spare lot and who has
fancy stock and keeps it in fancy style.
The dairymen declare that the competition
Will be unfair and be likely to greatly pre
judice consumers against them when there
wo uld really be no warrant for so doing.
But Veterinary Inspector Carpenter de
clares the bulletin board must be set up,
and it is now in course of preparation.
Charles Keller's TVoes.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 15. â Charles
Keller has applied for a divorce from the
bonds of wedlock that unite him to Kath
erine Keller, and in his complaint tells an
unusual story. He was married nearly
thirty years ago, and has grown children.
Keller "moved to Alameda some six years
ago, being a skilled mechanic and having
secured work in the Pacific Coast Borax
Works. For some reason his wife refused
to come to Alameda to reside. She not
only refused to come, but she disappeared
from her husband's view and knowiedee, !
and he professes that he has not the least I
idea in the world whither she went. !
Keller is now in ill health. He was very '
il! a few months ago, but not one of his I
children, who live hi fc-an Francisco, came i
to see him. He resolved, seeing that they j
were so indifferent to him, to separate i
himself legally from them, mainly to the I
end that some reai property in "Nevada
City may be wholly in his name to dispose
of as he may see fit.
A Japanese Boy Arrested.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 15.â Mrs. Alfred
Lundquist of 1709 Eagle avenue swore to a
complaint yesterday on which a warrant
was issued for the arrest of a Japanese ser
vant named Yamada. She declares that
the Japanese came to her house to borrow
a book, but attempted to assault her. He
declares that the complainant called him
a Chinaman a number of times, greatly ir
ritating him, during a call made to inquire
why the lady was displeased with a com
patriot which he had recommended for
service, and that the discussion degene
rated into a slicht scrap. A hearing be
fore a local magistrate will be necessary to
get at the facts of the case.
Burglars Around.
â¢ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 15. -An attempt
was made at an early hour this morning
to commit burglary in the office of the
electric railway power-house on Webster
street. Entrance was made at a side win
dow by pushing aside the fastening with a
knife. The safe showed signs of havin<Â»
been tampered with, but did not bear the
mark of any decided effort to crack it.
The burglaT or burglars appear to have
been frightened away before they accom
plished their purpose, or else they were
timid and inexperienced hands, who weak
ened when they saw what a job was be
fore them.
A Man Disappears.
ALAMEDA. Cal., Feb. 15.â Alfred Erie
has joined, for a time at least, the lartre
army of mysterious disappearances. He
was a driver for the Palace Bakery, and
drew $30 of his wages last Wednesday,
leaving $5 still owing, and went to San
Francisco. " That was the last seen or
heard of him by his Alameda friends. He
was a very steady and" frugal man, and
that fact has added to the perplexity of
his employers.
CUT OFF IN HIS PRIME.
Commodore Blow of the Oakland
Navy Was an Old Con
federate Soldier.
FROM A PRIVATE TO MAJOR.
Well Known in Connection With
Aquatic Sports All Round
the Bay.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
!X)3 Broadway, Feb. 15. j
Tlie sudden death of "W. W. Blow, the
well-known real estate man and canoeist,
came as a surprise to that gentleman's
numerous acquaintances in this county.
Although his tamiiy were not altogether
unprepared for the end, his business ac
quaintances did not know that he was se
riously ill.
He went to live at Berkeley about a
month ago for the beneiit of his wife's
health, she having been broken down
physically through attending her hus
band.
Mr. Blow's family was a branch of a dis
tinguished Virginia family. The deceased
was born in New York on April 13, 1842,
and was therefore only 54 years old when
the fatal attack of heart disea^2 ended his
busy life. Up to 1861 he was in business,
and in that year he went to Norfolk, Va.,
where he enlisted in the cause of the Con
federacy in the Norfolk Light Artillery
Blues, which was increased in member
ship as a consequence of the impending
conflict.
At Sewells Point he served with the
command in the lines. In the engagement
between the Monitor and Merrimac a flag
staff near the division to which Blow was
attached was cut in halves, the upper half
falling with the colors to the ground.
Blow seized the flag and climbing the
splintered pole replaced the colors at the
top amid the cheers of his fellow-soldiers.
General John B. Majatruder, who had
then resigned his commission as captain of
artillery in the United States army and
joined the Confederacy, heard of Blow's
valor and the nard fighter took the young
man into his own division. Mr. "Blow
remained in the service of the Confederacy
till the close of the war and at the surren
der of Appomattox he had climbed the
ladder from private to major of heavy ar
tillery.
Mr. Blow came to California in 1867 and
remained with the firm of Haggin <t Tevis
for many yeais. After severing his con
nection with that tirni he was engaged in
a brokerage business with his brother Al
fred. In 1870 he came to this city and
was married to Miss May A. Glascock.
daughter of the late Judge, and sister of
Hon. J. It. Glascock of this city. Since
coming here Mr. Blow has been "an active
hirure in real estate circles until July of
W. W. BLOW.

last year, when he transferred his busi
ness to his son.
The deceased was passionately fond of
the water and in ISBG he organized the
Oakland Canoe Club, of which he was
chosen commodore and which position he
has held ever since. He was largely in
strumental in bringing about the success
of the club. The deceased was a member of
the Knights of Pythias, but belonged to
no other older. The funeral will be held
from nis home on Monday afternoon.
BONDING IS DEFEATED.
Berkeley Declares Against a
Debt at a Popular Elec
tion.
Neither Wharf Nor Schools Can Be
Built Nowâ Baseball at the
University.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 15.â The propo
sitions to bond the town of Berkeley for
$200,000, to be expended in the erection of
four new school buildings and a wharf, to
cost ?1 20,000 and $80,000 respectively, were
both defeated at the election held to-day.
The total vote on the school proposition
was 1134, the number cast in its favor
being 676 and those against it 458. The
number required for its passage, according
to the law of a two-thirds vote, was 756.
The total vote on the wharf proposition
was 1147, the number cast in favor being
652 and those against it 4 1 J5. The vote re
quired for its passage was 766.
The election throughout the day was al
most entirely devoid of interest, very lit
tle electioneering work having been done
in either the east or west end. So quietly
did it pass off that it was quite impossible
to make a forecast of the outcome from
any manifestations on the part of the
voters.
Many of the older citizens and those who
have been in touch with the entire work
ings of both propositions since their origin
believed that the outcome of the election,
from the very conditions which brought
them into existence, would be defeat for
both. Others thought that the school
J proposition, at least, would carry, because
of the greatly overcrowded condition of
both the high and grammar schools at
the present time.
N At the municipal election held last May,
1739 votes were cast, and the number cast
to-day, those on the wharf proposition
being in the preponderance, was 1147, thus
showing that only about two-thirds of the
j iegal voters of Berkeley participated in
this election.
It is generally believed that the down
fall of each proposition was due to the ex
istence of the other, that there had been
an extraordinary amount of antagonism
lest one portion bf the town should be fa
vored, to the exclusion of the other. The
two precincts in the extreme east end of
town polled a heavy vote for schools and
a comparatively light one for the wharf,
while in the extreme vrest end, in which are
included the Sixth and Seventh precincts,
the vote was much heavier for the wharf
than for the schools.
Since the school building proposition has
been defeated it is a matter of speculation
as to what the Board of Education will do
in order to provide proper accommodation
for the overflow of pupils in both the high
and several grammar schools.
University Baseball.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 15.â The Berke
ley juniors and the dental college nine had
an exciting game of baseball this after
noon on the university diamond, which re
sulted in a score of 27 to 16 in favor of the
dental college team. In the first three in
nings the juniors had things their own
way, but in the fourth the "dentists' 1 beean
creeping up, and from that on did distin
guished work.
They had found the vulnerable points in
the juniors' playing and made good usage
of tlieir discoveries. At the end of the
seventh inning the score stood 18 to 15 in
favor of the affiliated college men. In this
inning tney recorded eight runs. In the
next they made two to the juniors' noth
ing, and in the final seven to their op
ponents' one.
The dental college battery was particu
larly strong, with Morden as pitcher and
Wheeler catcher. There were fewer errors
on the part of the dentals than the juniors,
but the rapid base-running of the latter
largely counterbalanced this shortcoming.
Almost the entire dental college was on
hand to witness the game and cheer iheir
comrades.
Following were the players and their
positions:

Sweet Potato Whisky.
J. W. Crow has a small bottle of sweet
potato whisky that is a very interesting
commodity in this section of the country,
and not a familiar one to the world at
large.
The liquid is crude and white, as all new
whisky is, but it is the genuine old stuff
and not a counterfeit.
Â£ Among the home-seekers who have been
to this section lately was Mr. Hansburg, a
German, who is skilled in the distillation
of spirits. When he saw how abundantly
sweet potatoes were raised in this section
of the country it occurred to him that he
could distill whisky from them. Several
bushels of sweet potatoes were shipped to
him, and soon Mike Brown received half a
gallon of sweet potato whisky.
As a result of the success of the scheme,
arrangements are being made to distill the
liquor for commercial purposes.
If the residue can be converted into
starch, the sweet potato will soon become
one of the most valuable products of
Southern soil.â Augusta Chronicle.

ANNIE PARKER DROWNED.
The Missing Young Woman Is
Found in the Bay at
Baden.
OAKLAND'S MYSTERY CLEARED.
She Was Identified by Her Letters.
The Coroner's Jury's Verdict
Is Suicide.
Oakland Office San Fbakcisco Call,^
90S Broadway, Feb. 15, 1896. f
Miss Annie Parker is no longer missing.
Her brother's fear ana John P. Woods'
suggestion that the unhappy girl ter
minated her life have both proved to be
trt:e. This mornine her body was recov
ered near Baden. A Coroner's jury de
cided that the deceased committed sui-
C.'l?.
The cause that led the unhappy girl to
taiie her own life is as much a mystery as
it ever was.
Since the whole community around the
nay was startled at the strange story of
Miss Parker's disappearance told exclu
sively in The Call the last day of Janu
ary, the interest in the event has not
abated.
Mie-s Parker was of a family most of
are members in standing in
; . First Baptist Church. She was very
popular and well known. She had a
goodly sum of money in the bank. She
was not known to have any love affairs,
out suddenly she disappeared.
Her brother could give no reason for his
belief , but he has declared all along that
be had an intuitive fear that his sister had
ended her life in the bay.
For over three weeks the search has been
made by the family, but nothing was
learned, and now it is probable that the
tragedy is over. But it is still a mystery
and must ever remain so.
To-night, for the hrst time since Annie
Parker left her home, the stiades were all
drawn and there was no light in the win
dow, lloiiing against hope the relatives
of the missint: girl have nightly looked for
her return. When the neighbors looked
out into the darkness at any hour of the
night they have seen one shade about half
waj down and a bright lamp burning in
the window. It was the signal of loving
hearts to the wanderer, so that if she did
return the house would not present a for
bidding unwelcome appearance. But the
beacon of love was never seen, and now the
unhappy relatives know that it can serve
no good purpose any longer.
John F. Woods, who was the last person
who made an appointment with the dead
girl, and who was wrongfully suspected' ot
knowing where Miss Parker went, was at
his cabin home in East Oakland to-night.
He was as much stricken with grief as
though he were a relative of the dead girl.
He repeated his story of how Annie had
hinted at suicide, and how she had looked
at him when he made an appointment at
his place of business to settle some matters
connected with the store. On that occa
sion Woods delayed the appointment a

Coroner of San Mateo County, was noti
fied of the finding of the body at noon.
He summoned a jury'and repaired to the
wharf to view the remains. He had the
body lifted out of the water and removed
to his ollice, where the inquest was held.
In speaking of it he said: "On examin
ation of the body I found black tanned
gloves on her hands.
"In the pocket were 55 cents, two keys, a
crocer's memorandum, a book containing
the addresses of a number of persons and
a small memorandum containing a few
items. There was a bill to Miss Parker,
1169 Jefferson street, Oakland, Cal., of
goo^is bought of an Oakland firm ; a letter
addressed to Miss Annie Parker, IWJ Jef
ferson street, Oakland, Cal., signed Mrs.
Wood, 1116 Granmount avenue, Baltimore,
Md.; a letter without cover addressed
"Dear Annie" and signed "Mrs. Wood."
The letters contained no more than
friendly chapter about their mutual friends.
There was nothing which could be con
strued in any way to show that Mrs. Wood
knew anything of the dead girl's intention.
"When we became satisfied the body
was that of Miss Parker I notified the Chief
of Police at Oakland, who said some one
would come down to identify the remains.
We waited the conclusion of the inquest
until Mr. Parker arrived. After his testi
mony I asked him if kc thought it neces
sary to holJ an autopsy on the body. He
objected very strongly to any autopsy,
ana, as the jury was satisfied, I did not
press the matter."
Ai the inquest S. 11, Mariner, United
States lighthouse tender at South San
Francisco, testified: "At about 10:25
o'clock a. v. I was outside with my boat to
trim the outer light, when at a point about
300 feet north from the outer lighthouse,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 16. 1896.
; I discovered something floating in the
! water of the bay, I drew my boat up to
; ascertain what it was. I found the body
i with the face down and full under the
! watnr, the back of the body projecting out
of the water. By the clothes I saw it was
' the body of a woman. I secured the body,
! and after fixing my lieht, brought it in to
! the wharf in front of the abattoir of the
! Western Meat Company. The distance
j from the shore where I picked the body
! up was about two miles.
"After reaching the wharf I turned the
i body over in the water so as to see the face,
: Mr. Patchell, superintendent of the pack
| ing-housp, being present. I then put
j Charles Farnum and my grandson to watch
! over the body until the Coroner could ar
! rive and take charge. The bands of de
j ceased were placed across tiie breast and
were rigid when 1 turned the body over."
H. W. Felton, M.D., testified: "I have
j made a thorough external examination of
the body found in the bay near Baden,
supposed to be that of Miss Annie Parker,
and I can find no external marks of vio
lence on the body made prior to death cx
i cept that are natural under the circuni-

stances. Further, that all of her clothes
were in perfect order, as she would
naturally appear on the street, even with
gloves on."
Albert P. Parker, brother of the de
ceased, identified the body as that of his
sister. Miss Annie Parker, and testified
that she was born at St. Paul, Minn. "She
loft home on the evening of January 22,
l*rx;, at about 7:05 p. m," he said. *"\Ve
have made diligent search, but have had
no clew to her whereabouts until we re
ceived notice this afternoon that the body
had been found. She was in the
dressmaking business at 110U Jefferson
street, Oakland. The business has been
poor of late and she was somewhat dis
couraged. Her family, at about 11:30
o'clock on the evening of her disappear
ance, found that sMe had left her watch,
two rings and a neckpin at home. On the
next evening they found under the bed
clothes two purses containing money, also
her bank-book and some papers pertain
ing to the business. They therefore had
fears thai she had committed suicide."
After hearing this testimony and view
ing the remains the jury returned the fol
lowing verdict:
That the name of the deceased was Annie
Parker, nged 36 years, a native of St. Paul,
Minn., fi:ul by occupation a dressmaker; that
she came to her death on or about the evening
of January 22, 181MJ, at the city of Oakland,
Alameua County, State of California, by drown
ing by her own voluntary act, committed with
suicitlai intention. D. O- Daggett, M. Foley,
George Kacese, T. B. Black, Kichard Harder,
Thomas Horn, S. H. Kennedy, William Clesby.
At the conclusion of the inquest Mr.
Parker had the body placed in a box and
brought to Oakland, where he arrived
about 11 o'clock.
The theory has been advanced by some
of the friends of the deceased that she had
not been in the water longer than ten
days. It was about that time that the re
port was made that a woman had jumped
from the ferry steamer Bay City on her i
last trip from San Francisco. This was
denied by the officials on the boat the next
day. However, those who know of the re
port hold to the theory that Miss Parker
was the one who went overboard that
night. At Baden there is a great deal of
speculation as to how a body should float
from this end of the bay to that vicinity,
as such a case has not been heard of here
tofore.
WERE GENERALLY CLEAN.
A Tour of Market-Street Res
taurants by Inspector
Davis.
Ordered Galvanized Iron Slop-Barrels
to Be Substituted for the
Wooden Ones.
Health Inspector Ben Davis took up his
work of looking into the sanitary condi
tion of restaurants yesterday, by making a
tour of those on Market street.
In some of the places visited the propri
etors were inclined to object to what they
considered an officious censorship of their
affairs, but Mr. Davis explained that it was
simply a work for the benefit of the general
public, and in consideration of the obvious
fact that the public is an important factor
in the restaurant business, the explanation
was readily acquiesced in.
About the only fault the Inspector had
to find yesterday was with the material of
which the slop-barrels were composed. He
found only one of iron and that was with
out a cover. The rest were of wood. He
ordered the wooden barrels to be replaced
with galvanized iron tanks with tight
covers, and was assured that what he re
quired would be done.
Mr. Davis says he will make monthly in
spections of the City's eating places.'and
he expects, he adds, that when the restau
rateurs see that it is to their best interests
to have everything nice and clean, they
will co-operate with the health, depart
ment.

DEEDS OF ANCIENT DATE.
How the Cemeteries of This City
Are Selling Burial
Lots.
RECORDED AFTER MANY YEARS.
The Richmond District Association
Will Inquire Into Those Trans
actions.
The Richmond District people, after
winning the anti-cemetery fight before the
Board of Supervisors, are vigilantly guard
ing their victory, and it is not without rea
son that they are remaining awake.
Notwithstanding the recent ordinance
passed by the board and signed by the
Mayor, interraent3 still go on in the City
graveyards at the average rate of fourteen
a day. During the last four days seven
teen bodies were buried in the Odd Fel
lows' Cemetery, two in the Masonic, six in
Laurel Hill and eighteen in the City Cem
etery. One body came from Sausalito and
one from Vallejo, showing that not only
are the residents of San Francisco contrib
uting to the mass of bodies that will one
day have to be removed, but the surround
ing bay towns are called upon to contrib
ute to the generally undesirable burial
places.
Shortly after the passage of the ordi
nance it was reported that the cemetery
people would get around the clause for
bidding the further sale of lots for burial
purposes by giving away the ground and
charging a good round sum for the dig
ging of the grave. But looking closely
in to the new law it was found that it pro
vided for all such little emergencies, and
so they cast about for another road out of
the woods.
Whether they found it is not known,
but In the last few days the sales
of five buriai lots have been recorded.
The prohibiting ordinance was recorded
February 4, 1896, and all graveyard lot
deeds of a later date would be void, but
the cemetery companies have provided for
that and some of those deeds are hoary
with age.
In the Masonic Cemetery, lot 6 of sec
tion 12 v/as sold to S. Hammersmith for
$331. It is dated May 30, 1877, and was
recorded February 11, 1896.
In Odd Fellows.' Cemetery lot 35, avenue
plat section, was sold to W. Munder for
$200. It is dated September 17, 1893, and
was recorded February 14, 1896.
In Laurel Hill Cemetery lot 1161 was sold
to Isaac Swan for $00. It is dated Decem
ber 15, 1869, and was recorded February 10,
1896. Lot '2752 was sold to Sarah E. Wright
for $96. It is dated July 14, 1890, and re
corded February 10, 1890. Lot 2902 was
sold to George E. Decker for $200. It is
dated November 6, 1895, ana was recorded
February 10, 1896.
All of these deeds are recorded subse
quent to the recording of the ordinance,
but the ancient dates are supposed to save
them.
â¢'But they are blundering," said At
torney Charles Hubbs of the .Richmond
District Protective Association yesterday,
"because the Supreme Court has affirmed
the decision that a recorded instrument of
a subsequent date has priority over an un
recorded instrument of a prior date. This
is the law. and even if those lots were pur
chased at those early dates the fact that
they were not recorded till the recording
of an opposing instrument â a law â makes
them void. Why, the burial lot deeas
which those people are paying their
money for are not worth the paper they
are written on.
"Do they think a law may be gotten
around so easily as that? If all the ceme
tery associations have to do is date their
deeds back prior to February 4, 1896 â the
recording date of the law â why, all this
noise over the enactment of the ordinance
is useless, for the cemeteries can go on
and sell iots through all eternity.
"But I tell you a man can't validate a
lawless act simply by changing a few fig
ures. The ordinance said ihat no more
lots within the City limits should be sold
or in any way disposed of for burial pur
poses, and it meant just that. But it is
amusing how they go at it. Look at that
Laurel Hill deed to Isaac Swan dated De
cember 15, 1869. From 18(39 to 1896 is a
quarter of a century â a long time for a
paper to go unrecorded. Mr. Swan was
rather careless regarding his valuable
papers. Even Mr. Hammersmith, in the
Masonic Cemetery, with his deed dated
May 30, 1877, let that instrument lie in
the dust of nineteen years before he
thought of recording it.
"But the cemetery corporations are lay
ing up trouble for themselves, for not only
are they selling lots under deeds of anti
quated and invalidated dates, but if there
is any juggling with those dates they will
be exposed. Suits may be brought against
each person buying a lot, and he will be
forced to swear as to when the lot transac
tion took place. Then the cemetery people
wilJ be compelled to produce their sale
records in court, so I fancy the truth will
come out. You may say that the Rich
mond district folks," after having won so
much, ire not going to sit down aud let
this thing make of no effect their past
work.
"There is another thing we have in
view. The Italian Benevolent Society's
Cemetery, near the City Cemetery, can'be
removed without any difficulty. The reso
lution which gave them the ground pro
vided that io case of the removal of the
cemeteries or the prohibition oi inier
ments, the City and County will not be
responsible for any improvements made in
the lots, the use of which is hereby
granted.
"We have still another scheme in hand
for the development of Richmond, and
some day we will have that locality blos
soming as the rose. We are going to me
morialize our representatives in Congress
to have the City cemeteries removed and
the ground laid out in a Government park
with driveways, lawns and an ornamental
lookout station on or near Point Lobos.
It could be made a beautiful spot, fronting
the bay, the Golden Gate and the great
Pacific. These things will all come when
the graveyards are cone and the quick,
not the dead, inhabit San Francisco. 1 '
HOME FOE POOR GIRLS.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper Warmly Commends
the Girls' Home Directors.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper spoke on "Taking
care of the girls between childhood and
womanhood" Thursday night during the
annual meeting of the directors of the Girls'
Training Home at the First Baptist
Church.
She warmly commended the noble work
undertaken by the society. She said that
the method employed of preparing girls to
enter Christian families was the only true
method of caring for the unfortunate ones.
She advocates, however, that the pirls be
given an industrial training, that they
may be taught what is useful to them in
their household duties.
It Was Dr. U. 11. Hart.
A long, hard fight was made before the
Finance Committee of the Board of Super
visors Friday morning, for money to better the
sanitary condition of some of the public
schools by a short, gooa-natured looking man
with a high forehead. He spoke earnestly and
answered a volley of questions in a way that
Bhowed he had made an exhaustive study of
the cause he cnampioned. The fight was re
corded, but the plucky tighter was spoken of the
next morning as Dr. Rosenstirn. Dr. Rosen

THERE is an active, alert little '
woman, 70 years of age, but who
wears the appearance of not more
than 55, living up on Mason
street, who was a familiar neigh
bor and friend of Abraham Lincoln during
his early years and until the time he was
elected to the Presidency. She is Mrs.
Annie Heibach. With her husband she
came to California in IR(J2, her husband's
sympathies not being strong enough with
North or South to lead him to enlist, and
when it came to the period of the draft his
nogative feeling caused him to wish to
avoid it. Tne husband is now dead and
Mrs. Heibach lives with her two
daughters.
The little woman's memory is charged
MRS. ANNIE HEIBACH.
"7 rsrn't remember a thnr when I did not kii""' Abe Lincoln,* 1 said Jlfrs. Heibach.
[Sketched from life by a "C'aZZ" artist.]
with incidents of her early life in which |
Lincoln figured. Her father's family and I
his were neighbors both in Indiana and j
Illinois, and she may be said almost to ]
have grown up with Lincoln. Her mem- I
ory of the events of those pioneer days is
perfectly clear, although she does not at
tempt to cite dates for any of them. They
were simply the everyday affairs of her j
jdy life, to whion she had no occasion to
ich the month and year.
Her father was James L. Grant. He ;
was an Englishman and a lawyer, but
while he had no faculty for money-mak
inc, neither was he devoted to his profes- '
Bion, although he gained some local emi
nence in it ana was deemed quite an
orator. He was a friend and in the early j
nays a champion of Lincoln. Mrs. Hei- j
bach claims the honor for him of having
rirst proposed Lincoln for the State Legis
lature, worked hard for his election and
predicted greater thing? for him as the
years would run on. Mr. Grant's people
were wealthy, and he baa come out on the
plains of Indiana and afterward to Illinois
with a collection of books that formed for
the time and place quite a fine library. He
did not practice law much, but bought a
big stretch of land and raised cattle.
"I cannot remember a time when I did
not know Abe Lincoln' 1 said Mrs. Hai
bach yesterday. 'It seems to me that the
two families, his and mine, were always
neighbors. I remember him as a tall,
lanky boy, who was good-natured and
kind to everybody, and was constantly
doing favors for some neighbor. I remem
ber as a little girl that we lived in In
dianaâthat is, I have since learned it was
Indiana. Then I remember that the Lin
colns moved away, and after some time we
moved also. The country where we set
â vas wild and there were few people.
P..: 1 found that the Lincolns were again
among our nearest neighbors. I very well
remember the first visit that Lincoln paid
upon our removal to the new country,
which was Illinois. You should have
s<>en him. He was then very tall and was
dressed in the roughest clothes.
"His pants were like bags and were
stuffed into the tops of his boots. They
were so big he couldn't get them all in,
and they hung down over tne front in a
comical manner. But he romped and
played with the children like a great big
schoolboy.
"About this time I considered Lincoln
the ugliest person I ever saw, but in time
his face grew to be good-look'ng. I don't
know what kind of work he was doing
a^out this time, but think it was that of a

farmhand. I know his folks were awfully
poor, and Lincoln would be absent from
his home for weeks at a time. c
"My father took a great interest in him,
and allowed him the freest use of his
library. This Lincoln appreciated greatly,
and availed himself of it as much as his
work would permit him to do. He would
read in our house and often take the books
to his own home. Then 1 remember he
became a candidate for the State Legisla
ture. My father was among the hrst, if
not the first, to bring forward his name for
the nomination. At tins time, you under
stand, I had no idea that Lincoln was any
body more than a woodsman, while my
father was quite a bis: man in the commu
nity. He was well read and made speeches.
! He had no political ambitions, however,
i or, indeed, was not much at money-mak
i ing. We all lived in log cabins ana in the
S very plainest fashion.
"My father was interested in Lincoln
; not so much because he showed signs of
greatness but because he- was so thor
oughly honest and good. I think he was
j as near perfect in that way as a man could
' be. I don't think an evil thought ever cn
| tered that man's head. He would not
| take the slightest advantage of anybody.
| If he had a horse to swap he wanted to see
; the other man get as good as he gave.
My father worked very hard to secure Lin
| coin's election to the Legislature, going
| about the country making speeches and
i electioneering.
"But as for myself," continued Mrs.
Heibach, "I never took any particular in
terest in Abe Lincoln, and that is one rea-
I son perhaps why I cannot fix the dates of
j any of these things. He was the last one
\ of our neighbors that I would ever have
j thought of being a great man. But when
I think of him now I can see that he was
different from the other men. There was
| something about Him that made him
j everybody's friend. He always had a
i smile on his face when he talked, but
I when he was studying one of my father's
I books he looked so serious that he seemed
| to be sick, and always frightened me so
that I seldom went near him.
"For several years alter that I don't
know just when I saw Abe Lincoln and
when I didn't. He seemed to be around
I most of the time, no matter where we
lived. I remember when he was married
' and when Robert (Bob, we called him)
was born.
"But during these years Abe Lincoln
| was becoming a great man," said Mrs.
i Heibach after a pause. "He never forgot
j his old neighbors, though. I recollect
once, when he had got so that everybody
looked up to him. that he called to see
my father on some important business.
j He had a number of State officials with
him, and was dressed in what were con
sidered tine clothes in those days. After a
few moments' conversation Lincoln left
the party in the front room with my father
| and went out into the kitchen to see my
; mother. There happened to be some
potatoes roasting in the asjies at the time,
and Lincoln saw them. Reaching down
he scraped one out, and after rubbing it on
his elegant black pants to clean it asked
my mother for some salt. She protested
and wanted to cet him a plate, but he
wouldn't allow it, and broice it open while
I standing in front of the fire and ate it with
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1896.
great relish. This is interesting only in
trie light of his after greatness, of course,
for that is the way the Lincolns them
selves roasted potatoes and ate them,"
said Mrs. Heibach, with a smile.
"Shortly after that," she continued, "I
was married and don't remember seeing
Lincoln again. My father and mother
died and rqy brothers and sisters moved
away, so that our family was broken up.
Once after Lincoln was elected President
he wrote me a letter in regard to some
business. I did not think very much of it
and of course it got lost. It was only after
he was killed that I got to thinking much
about him, and even then it seemed hard
to realize that one of the greatest men
that ever lived should be the same Abe
Lincoln that used to run about our nousc
on such familiar terms, never caring a
whit about his appearance.
"What wa3 his letter to me about?
Well it was in answer to one I wrote him.
After my father's death we learned of an
interest we had in the estate of his father
in England. We had no one particularly
to turn to for advice and one day I sat
down and wrote Abe â Mr. Lincoln, he
was then at the White House, Washing
ton, telling him all about it. Almost by
ret.urn mail the answer came, written in
Lincoln's own hand, expressing his sor
row for our loss and his in the death of
his old friend Grant, and telling me to
make out the papers and send them to him
and he would attend to the matter for us
and that it would not cost us a cent.
"I did so, but there was interference
from some others in our family, which was
a large one. One wanted to do one tiling
and another wanted to do some other.
This probably illustrates more than any
thing how difficult it was for us women
to believe that our old neighbor, Abe
Lincoln, was wiser than anybody else,
even though he was then President of the
United States. I put no value on his
autograph letter, and allowed it to be de
stroyed or lost â perhaps threw it in the
tire myself. And as for his advice it was
overruled by the others in the family, his
offer of assistance, which would doubtless
have served us to the full accomplish
ment of wiiat we desired, was ignored.
We put the matter in the hands of a
Chicago banker ami lawyer and never
got anything out of it."
It was only after the death of Lincoln
that Mrs. Heibach began to appreciate the
real greatness of her one-time neighbor.
She says she has always been dillident
about bringing her knowledge or relation-
I ship to him to public notice, although she

realizes now that they must be of general
interest. Once entered upon the subject
she delights to recall and dwell upon the
incidents in her life associated with that
of the martyred President. Of these there
seems to be no end. In speaking of him
her mind leaps from one occasion to
another with great rapidity, and
without regard to order or sequence.

Beautie* of Colonial Architecture.
Nothing is much better as a model for
American domestic work than colonial
architecture of the early part of the
century; nothing is worse than
"modern colonial," for to the popu
lar architect a house may be made
colonial by covering a confused plan and
a chaotic exterior with details unintel
ligently copied from old colonial furni
ture. He is serenely ignorant of the
fact that what is good in an old colonial
house is its superb frankness, straight
forwardness and simplicity. From a pur
ist's- standpoint much colonial detail evi
dences a debased taste, and is merely the
result of an uneducated builder's attempt
to call to mind the work with which ho
himself was familiar in England. But

BEATING HEARTS STUDIED
A Stanford Scientific Girl Takes
Them Out by the
Score.
PROBLEM OF WOMAN'S BREATH.
Pursuing Secrets of Life in Dogs,
Turtles and Boys in a Physio
logical Laboratory.
There is a bright young lady student
down at Stanford University who is dili
gently, month after month, working away
with hearts that she keeps palpitating for
hours after ttiey are torn from the places
where they grew.
Miss Evelyn Briggs is studying the "re
fractory period" of the heart, and to find
out about that mystery scores of still beat
ing hearts have been sacrificed on electric
brass altars in the university laboratories.
Of course, they are not human hearts that
are thus grimly toyed with on the border
land between life and death, but it is a
highly important secret of the human
heart that Miss Briggs is ardently pursu
ing.
They are the hearts of mud turtles that
keep up the interesting procession from
the bay marshes to the pneuinographs.
As has long been known the heart of a
turtle or a frog can be kept beating for
many hours after death if it is supplied
with blood or even a proper salt solution.
If a turtle's heart is removed promptly
after death and put into blood it will lie as
though dead for about four hours, and then
will begin its rhythmic contractions just as
though it was where it belonged and the
turtle had come to life again.
Among the great number of scientific
machines in tne physiological laboratory
down there is a rather complicated little
one in which a turtle's heart is placed and
kept pumping blood from one bottle into
another. The heart is piaced in a little
glass bulb, at the top of wriich are tubes
which are connected with the openings in
the heart. Rubber tubes connect with two
reservoirs placed about on a level with the
heart and the heart will pump away
for twenty-four hours or so without
getting tired. No stimulus of any kind is
applied. By a delicate mechanism the
movements of the heart cause aÂ» pen to
graphically and exactiy record them on a
moving paper ribbon. By this means the
physiological action of the heart can be
studied to great advantage. There it is
right before the observer's eyes, and the
strength, time and faintest variations of
movement are plainly recorded.
This shows that tne power and tendency
to contract la inherent in the heart itself
and that each contraction is not due to a
stimulus involuntarily supplied by the
nerves reaching the heart, as has been
supposed up to a comparatively short time
ago. The heart works away like an inde
pendent thing ot life within us. The
I nerves reaching the heart only regulate its
' movements, and only to a certain'extent.
Through the nerves the effect of drugs,
I of mental states and the need of the body
for more or less blood is conveyed to the
heart, retarding or hastening its move
ments.
Tne study of the movements of the
heart with the aid of the minutely precise
recording machines show that there is a
certain period in a heartbeat when the
! movement cannot be affected. The heart
I sets the limit to the extent that it will be
interfered with. If an electric or nervous
stimulus be applied just after a contrac
tion has begun that contraction will not
be interfered with and the stimulus will
have to wait until the heart is ready to be
affected by it. The period in a beat dur
ing which the heart maintains its inde
pendence is called the refractory period.
Another of the ways in which the heart
asserts its independence is in way in
which it maintains its rhythm. If a quick
stimulus is applied, making one quicker
contractionâ making the heart lose step
it will give a very slow contraction to
wait for the regularly rhythmic instant for
the next beat. All these things are studied
with great detail in the physiological
laboratory.
Miss Briggs' study of the refractory
period deals with a special unsolved prob
lem. It is disputed among physiologists
whether the power of contraction resides
in the heart muscles themselves or in the
nerves and ganglia of the heart itself.
When the turtle's heart beats away in the
glass bulb, Is the power resident in the
muscles or in the nerve matter among
them? Now Miss Briggs is tackling this
problem. Her investigations will be an
important contribution to physiological
science, and she may possibly achieve
quite a famous triumph.
She is now working with a slice of the
heart only. A piece of heart muscle
placed in blood will contract, too, as the
whole heart will. She is taking the apex
of the heart, in which there are no ganglia
and but few nerve filaments, tying a piece
of thread to each side and connecting it
so with the pen of the recording machine.
She is trying to find out if the refractory
period under all sorts of conditions is the
same for a piece of heart muscle with no
nerves in it as it is for the heart and its
nerves together, and many turtles must
die that sufficiently extensive studies may
be made.
Miss Briggs' ardent efforts to locate the
residence of life-energy in the heart seems
a little like the efforts to find where the
soul resides.
There are lots of other interesting and
important original investigations being
pursued by advanced students in this as in
other departments of the university. Orie
inal search for truth is the spirit that per
vades Stanford University.
There is Mis 3 Mosher, a post-graduato
student and instructor in hygiene, who
has tackled the disputed question about
the natural physiological difference be
tween the breathing of men and women.
The books have always said that men
breathe more with the abdominal
muscles and the women more with the
thoracic muscles. But the books are al
ways being corrected and great physiolo
gists are now disputing about this point.
Thousands of graphic records displaying
every respiratory movement of men have
been made, but comparatively few women
have stood and breathed that machines
might tell just how much they used the
upper, middle and lower parts of their
chests in respiration. Of course there are
fewer opportunities to make such meas
urements of a large number of women
than of men.
Miss Mosher is supplying that lack
somewhat. Over in the girls' gymnasium
she has set up various kinds of scientific
apparatus, and every girl in the university
is being harnessed up beside a cylinder
that rolls a ribbon of paper past pen
points, while a long pendulum, as it
swings on the wall, clips a needle through
a dish of mercury, and so every second
makes an electric connection which jerks
another pen on the record and marks the
time beside the curves which exhibit the
muscle movements.
Sometimes rubber tubes are clasped
around the body at three places and the
degree of movement at inspiration and
expiration is recorded as the result of the
changing air-pressure in the tubes. Then
there are other instruments which,
when attached to the body, serve
to convey the respiratory movements
to the machine. There are also
spirometers and so on for measuring lung
capacity and tapeline measurements are
recorded. It requires a great number of
observations to supply material for deduc
tions of any value, but Miss Mosher has
got so lar along that she expects to demon
strate in a scientific paper, to be produced
this year, that when women breathe
mainly with their costal mussles it is the
result of tight clothing, and not according
to nature's plan.
The Stanford girls breathe for science in
their ordinary tight clothing, and then in
loose and pretty gymnasium costumes of
blue blouse and short skirt, in which they
daily trip over the short path between the
side door of Roble Hall and the gymna
sium in the rear. One of Miss Mosher's
dilliculties is that it is often hard for the
girls to breathe naturally and without
conscious effort when they are hitched to
the machine. It is Miss Mosher's opinion
that in many cases tight clothing has
changed the type of breathing, but that
nature intended women to breathe as
deeply and freely as men. Miss Mosher's
experiments with Stanford girls will soon
give another Stanford University contri
bution to science.
There is another young lady who is put
ting very young mice in cold baths and
measuring the increased amount of car
bonic acid gas given off in respiration as a
result of the increased consumption of
carbon in the natural effort of the body to
keep warm. It is rather a delicate trick to
measure jiust the extra amount of carbonic
acid gas in the breath of a baby mouse
when it is feeling chilly. There is nothing
foolish about this. It is a known fact, of
course, that warm-blooded animals will
internally consume more carbon when the
body's heat needs to be kept up. There are
certain animals which for a very
short period â in some cases not more
than a few hours after birth â do
not Â»have this power to increase
tbeir consumption of carbon when more
heat is needed. The existence and the
lack of this power and its development
may be seen to constitute a scientific prob
lem of interest to a scientist who is pur
suing truth for its own sake. The stu
dents in the regular course of their lab
oratory work perform these and similar
physiological experiments with mice, but
the young lady mentioned has taken up
one definite, unsolved problem and is pur
suing it. There is nothing very cruel in
the operation, because the mice are only
made a little chilly and fixed so that the
breath they exhaie can be taken care of.
The carbonic acid gas exhaled is absorbed
by chemicals, by the way, and then
weighed.
Then there is A. B. Spaulding, the foot
ball-player, who is another one of the ad
vanced students doing interesting work in
the physiological department. He is
studying the pineal gland â that long
mysterious part of the brain of man and
all animals which comparative studies
have proved to be a rudimentary third eye.
The pineal gland is the remains of an eye
in the back of the head which has long
been lost in the process of evolution. It is
most nearly an eye in the lizard, and in
the lizard is Plainly shown what the
pineal gland was intended for. The full
full-grown lizard shows a scaly sign of it
on top of his head, but it is in the embryo
lizard that it is most nearly what it once
was. Mr. Spauldiag is making long and
elaborate studies of the brains of embryo
lizards. In one of these brains is displayed
on top of the head an almost transparent
scale and just under it what is plainly a
crystalline lens. Mr. Spaulding has a great
numDerof interesting microscopic slides
showing the structure of this lost eye at
the point where it now reaches its highest
development. He has also made enlarged
wax models of the brain in sections, and
they show the protuberance where the
eye is at the back of the head and an open
ing running down into the brain. The
main importance of the work that Mr.
Spaulding has done has been the recent
discovery of some filaments which he and
Professor Jenkin3 are inclined to think
are nerve filaments of a retina. If this
turns out to be so it will be a distinct and
important discovery.
The regular laboratory work which con
somes every afternoon is much of it quite
as interesting as these special scientific
investigations. There are 175 young men
and women taking the physiological
course, about one-third of whom expect to
become physicians. Professor O. P. Jen
kins is at the head of the department, and
he is an enthusiastic and progressive
worker who inspires enthusiasm among
his students. Textbooks are not made so
much of down there as they generally are.
Pnysiology, biology, anatomy and allied
sciences are studied on modern scientific

principles. Physiology is generally taken
to be the study of whether one ought
to eat hard or soft eggs and when to
take salt water baths, but at Stanford
it is pursued as a science, and by the most
modern educational methods. There are
now at Stanford more students doing the
latest laboratory work than there are in all
the other universities of America put to
gether. They get at the laws by which
the different parts of the human body
work, and do it by finding out for them
selves. A world of problems are solved
by the students. They measure for them
selves the velocity of nervous impulse;
the effect on nervous action of tempera
ture, drugs, and so on; the effect of vari
ous conditions ana stimuli on the nature
and power of muscular contraction, etc.
They study arterial pressures, the control
of different sets of nerves over circulation,
and they study respiration and other
physiological functions in all sorts of
ways.
This educational work involves a great
slaughter of the lower ai:imals in
that part of Santa Clara County. They
don't need any pound for dogs
about Palo Alto. If anybody wants to
get rid of a good-for-nothing cur they
can find plenty of Stanford boys who
will joyously take charge of him and lead
him to the physiological laboratory, where
his last unconscious gasp 3 and his faint
dying heart beats will be caught on a paper
ribbon and preserved. Likewise cats. The
Stanford boys, however, never steal dogs
or cats, despite rumors of mysterious
feline disappearances. Then tLe boys set
traps for mice and rabbits, tramp off to
the marshes to catch frogs and turtles and
to the woods for lizards and other things.
The fishermen and marsh hunters down
there know the home turtle market.
They don't do much in the way of vivi
section, and whenever it is done the vic
tim peacefully sleeps under the influence
of anesthetics. A number of dogs have
recently shown in the laboratory how
their blood circulated. In the study of
the circulation of a dog he is placed on a
laboratory table and chloroformed. Then
a canula is inserted in an artery of the
neck and connected by a rubber tube with
the big and complicated recording
machine, which is run by an electric
motor, while a long pendulum, with elec
trical connections, marks the time. C. XV.
Green, who is an ardent student himself,
will show how to bare the vagus nerve
leading to the heart and then it is touched
with an electric wire.
The recording pen which has been mak
ing rhythmic zigzag lines on the paper in
response to every infinitesimal change of
heart pressure, will appear to have a fit for
a second or two and there on the paper
will be seen just how the dog's heart spas
modically contracted. Then drugs and
poisons such as pylocarpin, bromo caifein,
nitro-glycerine and so on will be given the
dog, and their action on the heart will be
plainly seen. Probably the dog's respira
tion is being similarly recorded on the
same ribbon with another pen, and after
three or four hours of experiment the re
cording pens will go up and down on the
moving paper more faintly. Soon the
movements peter out and the pens make

but straight marks, which means that
death has come. The respiration is ob
served to always cease before the heart
does.
Then the ribbon, rods long perhaps, is
taken off for future study, and soon a knot
of young men and women may be seen in
terestedly dissecting the remains oh an
other laboratory table.
By these and a great number of similar
experiments the students are constantly
inquiring for themselves into the secrets
of life. Every part and function, so far as
possible, is placed under experimental in
quiry.
But the students do more experiment
ing on themselves and on each other than
on the animals sacrificed. One thing, for
instance, that the students all do is to
map out the surface of the body according
to its sensitiveness to various things, .for
instance, how far apart can two points
touching the skin be distinguished as
two and not one. Students go in pairs
to corners, and while one shuts or
averts his eyes the other will touch hig
skin with his compass, and the subject
tells if he can whether he is touched with
one or both of the compass points. "One,
one, two, one, two," says the subject, and
half the time he is wrong. Every answer
is recorded and results figured out later.
The students learn that people vary in
perception of this sort, but that as a rule
we can distinguish on the tip of the
tongue two points from one when they
are 1.1 millimeters apart, in the palm of
the index finger at 2.2, in the palm of the
second finger at 4.4, on the back of the
hand at 2!).8 and on the back at 66 milli
meters. Practice increases this percep
tion and the back of the hand can be edu
cated.
They practice the perception of time in
tervals with the touch and find that the
touch beats the ear in this. By the touch
intervals of one fifteen-hundredth of a
second can be distincuished from con
tinuous pressure, while vastly slower
sound intervals would seem a continuous
sound.
Those recording machines are in con
stant use in studying human respiration,
circulation, and so on. The students sit,
stand and lie by them and get the graphic
records of their circulation and respiration
when they are tired, when they are rested
and when they come in from a hard bicycle
ride. In takine the record of circulation a
cardiograph is fastened over the heart and
its beating against a sensitive rubber bulb
is transmitted to the recording pens.
They measure the carbonic acid gas ex
haled under different conditions, the tidal
and residual air in the lungs and so on.
The machines record the slightest laugh
ing, couching or talking, and these things
can be distinguished in the record.
The study of the influence of nervons
stimulus on the involuntary muscles and
of the amount of work the voluntary
muscles can do under various conditions is
another of the many fields into which
Professor Jenkins and Professor Greene
lead the students.
It Is not surprising that 175 Stanford
students are deeply interested in varioua
mysterious problems of physical life.

The Mistery of Bay
yj- Yf -A-^ Robert Louis Stevenson been
I 1 1 familiar with the early history
Jj of Bay Farm Island, whicn lies
II just south of pladd Alanieda
and separated from that quiet
suburb by the estuary and a waste of
marsh and mud, and with the life story of
one of the queer beings that inhabited
it in the early days, his marvelous pen
might have related a tale of actual fact
that would have rivaled in interest even
that of the mythical Treasure Island, to
which he attributed his first financial suc
cess as a writer of fiction.
From its appearance it needs no great
stretch of imagination to picture the
island as a place where hoards of gold
might lie buried. Viewed from Alameda
it lies long and low against the southern
horizon, with a fringe of trees on the west
ern end and a few dreary sand-dunes to
the east, where the solid ground melts
cway into the deep black mire of the
marsh. A. bridge now spans the estuary,
from the southern end of which a sub-
Btantial wagon-road leads to the prosper
ous farms beyond; but in the early days
â the latter fifties aud early sixties â the
only communication with the island was
by boat, and the trailic was greater to San
Francisco than to the nearer town of Ala
meda.
The island was sparsely inhabited in
those times â the days of gold â the few set
tlers being of the plodding kind who had
resisted the blandishments of the mines,
to accumulate their fortunes more slowly
and more surely by agricultural pursuits
or, having tempted fortune in the gold
fields and failed, had taken to tilling the
soii as the only alternative.
Somewhere on the island, buried deep
beneath the dense black loam, lies a box
of gold, the accumulation of a lifetime of
toil and privation, which, in these days
when men struggle for a competence,
would be by many considered a fortune.
Many times has it been searched for, but
always in vain, and the oldest inhabitants
as well as the younger gene-ration to
whom its history has been handed down
agree that it is still there and likely to re
main buried until the judgment day.
Opinions vary as to the amount of golden
coin the box contains, but the least esti
mate places it at $20,0(30, while many be
lieve that $30,000 would be nearer the" cor
rect figure.
One dark night in September, ISvS. a
stalwart Portuguese, bearing on his broad
shoulders an iron-bound box that taxed
his strengtli to c:irry, appeared at the
Alameda end of the" island ferry and
asked the boatman who carried passengers
across to land him on the island. He
guarded his box jealously, and when the
landing was readied paid the ferryman's
fee, reshouldered his burden and
trudged along the narrow trail that
threaded through the marsh to the firmer
ground.
A few days previous to his nocturnal
trip he had purchased from an eariy
eettler, who bore the name of Pegleg Wil-
Eon,fora few hundred dollars, a truct of
twent;, acres of the best land in the west
ern portion of the island, and though the
journey at night with the heavy box ex
cited some curiosity it was known tuat he
intended settling there, and the incident
was soon forgotten, beinir recalled only by
subsequent events.
Frank Silva, for such was the man's
name, wasted no time after taking posses
sion of his farm, but with the diligence of
his race soon had it in shape to farm, and
before lons was shipping quantities of
vegetables to the San Francisco market
that, in those day 9 of high prices, brought
mm handsome returns. Though not tall,
he was a giant in strength and no labor
seemed to be too great as iong us in brought
money to his pockets, for he was undeni
ably close and hoarded his gains in a man
ner that most of his neighbors considered
miserly.
Being reticent as well as close it was
long before his history became known to
the islanders, and then only through the
taik of a Portuguese in whom Silva had
confided ana who was more garrulous than
his countryman.
In his youth Silva had been a seaman in
the Portuguese navy, but the allurements
of the new world tempted him to desert
the life of a man-of-war's man and sail
away in an emigrant ship to New York.
In those days the whaling industry was
in the zenith of its prosperity and dozens
of stout barks and ships sailed each year
for the frozen north in search of the levi
athans that paid well for the catching.
The days of the steam whaler had not
come as yet and the crews of the vessels
that braved the Arctic winters usually re
turned with good credits in the ships'
books. Within a month after landing in
New York Silva rau across a Portuguese
captain wi.o commanded a New Bedford
t>ark and signed with him for a cruise to
the Arctic.
The voyage was a very prosperous one,
and Siiva, after depositing bis earnings <

with a countryman of his, who kept a
Bailor's resort in New Bedford, sailed
again in search of blubber anÂ«i wealth.
He made several voyages in this way, and
was gradually accumulating a sum he had
set his heart on saving for the purpose of
returning to his childhood's home in
sunny Portugal, when an event occurred
that changed the entire course of his life.
The captain decided to sail to the south in
search of sperm whales, and after encoun
tering a storm that caused damage to the
ship _ necessitating repairs to the vessel,
put into Rio Janeiro to have the work
done.
In the harbor was another vessel which
was bound to California, and the stories
which those on board told Silva of the
wonderful land of gold mo worked upon
his imagination that he deserted the
whaler, and joininsr the gold-seekers
sailed away for the El Dorado.
Surviving the dangers of the deep he
reached San Francisco early in 1852, and
with his companions on the ship rushed
away to the diggings. For some reason he
did not remain long, but ro turned to San
Francisco and later crossed the bay and
settled on a large tract of wild land near

wilderness, but it gradually enhanced in
value until, in I?SS, he disposed of it for
$12,000. Previous to this he sent a relative

ing-house master, which amounted to
about $4000. After a long absence the rela
tive returned with the 'cash, which Silva
added to his hoard. These sums, with the
accumulations oi his years of wont on the
ranch, made up the content? of the great
box that he took across the estuary when
he made his night trip to his i3land farm.
How much more he accumulated be
fore death called a halt on his labors is a
matter of conjecture, though it must have
been considerable. He not only farmed
his own place, but assisted his neighbors,
and even helned with the loading and un
loading of the vessels that came into the
estuary when his services were asked. He
made much more money and spent very
little anri his neighbors knew that he was
saving it.
it became an open secret after Silva had
lived a few years on the island that his
hoard was bailed in the ground. He made
no denial of it and only laughed when
advived to put his money in the bank.
"De groun' is my bank," he said.
"Banks break â de groun' never."

those for the shipping "of his produce to

money. During the night he dug up his
box, obtained the necessary funds ana
again gave it to the keeping of mother
earth. After several years of single life on
the island Silva took a wife, a young Port
uguese girl, the daughter of a neighbor,
and his friends thought he would give up
his previous habits and live like the rest of
them, but they were mistaken. The wife
proved to be as close and saving as her
husband and rather assisted him in his
accumulation of wealth than proved a
source of expense.
Then came a time when typhoid fever
found a lodgment on the island and Silva
fell a victim to it. He reluctantly took to
his bed and still more reluctantly" bade his
wife call in a man to work the farm dur
ing his illness. She found a helper in a
stout, industrious Portuguese, who worked
faithfully from early morning untfl the
setting of the sun.
In her constant attendance at her hus
band's bedside Mrs. Silva had no oppor
tunity of watching the mau, and not being
satisfied with the manner in which some
of the fields were arranged he speedily
arranged the fences and other landmark's
to suit himself and within the space of a
few weeks so altered the aspect of the
farm that even its owner would hardly
recognize it.
l,n the meantime the sick man on his
bed of pain moaned and talked of his
buried hoard and, according to the physi
cian who attended him, so worried biin-
self that his recovery wa3 seriously re
tarded.
Finally, however, he was able to sit up
and his wife told him of the changes' that
bad been wrought on the farm.
Silya listened with staring eyes until she
had finished, and then, with a wild cry,
sprang to the door and looked out toward
the south.
The immediate landscape was so changed
that he did not recognize it and he contin
ued to stare in a vain attempt to locate the
landmarks that had formerly led him to
his treasure. Suddenly he turned to his
wife with a vacant laugh and said:
"The earth ha 3 aot it and she will
keep it."
Ti:e sufferine: he had endured and the
fear that his treasure was lost had turned
Silva's Drain.
Careful nursing brought him back some
degree of physical strength, but his mind
remained weak. Day after day he roamed
about thjs farm shaking his head and try
ing to remember some clew by which he
could trace bis gold, but though his wife
and friends did everything to assist his
memory he never sufficiently recovered
thid reason to find the money. In the silent
watches of the night, when nothing but
the beating of the waves on the sandy
s hores of the island broke the stillness, he
would leave his bed and wander for hours
about the fields searching, searching for
his lost treasure, crying aloud in hia an
guish of mind, but never sufficiently col
lecting his thoughts to follow the paths
he had formerly taken to reach the cache.
His wife had the ground in thÂ« direction
in which he had first looked when told or
the changes in the farm carefully searched,
but no trace of the box was found.
Gradually Silva's mind became more and
more clouded until it was finally deemed
best to have him restrained, and he was
sent to Dr. Traynor's private sanitarium
in Alameda, where he vied after some
years of confinement.
For several years following Silva's death
searches were made periodically for the
hidden hoard. Men living on the island
who had known of its existence dug over
acres of ground and delved deep into the
soil in their eagerness to possess the
treasure, but their efforts came to naught
and they finally gave up in despair.
Then a medium who had heard the story
of Silva's hoard told some of her followers
that the box was located in the center of a
certain mathematical figure formed by the
trees in the orchard.
Despite the widow's protests, they began
a mad hunt for the gold, digging deep
trenches among the trees and making the
well-kept place look like a hastily built
fortified camp.
The medium again gave them directions,
after they had become disgusted, saying
that she must have misinterpreted" the
signs of the spirits and that the treasure
must be buried beneath the house.
Before they could be prevented tne gold
hunters had dug away a portion of the
foundations, and only left when the thor
oughly exasperated widow hired a man
with a shotgun to prevent them from un
dermining the house. Tnen the widow
tried again to find the money and had
holes drilled over acres and acres of
ground, hoping that the iron point would
strike the box and thus reveal its where
abouts, but all in vain, and finally despair
ing of ever recovering the treasure, she
sold her farm to B. "Benedict, in whose
possession it still remains, and left the
island.
Many of the old settlers on the island â
the Clevelands, McDonalds. Hamlins and
Benedicts â remember Silva and his buried
treasure perfectly and often relate the
story ol the box and its unfortunate owner
when showing visitors over their fat
acres and well-kept fields.
Recently some mysterious persons, who
are believed by the islanders to be treas
ure-hunters, have been inakinr; inquiries
regarding the Silva farm ; whether the
location of the house has been changed
since he died and. whether the original
acres are for sale. At the time of their
last visit to Bay Farm Island they prom
ised to return and negotiate for the furm,
winch is now worth "thousands of dollars
per acre. Whether or not they possess
some long-hidden clew to the location of
tne box or are merely intending to hunt
for it at random no one knows, but their
return is awaited with interest, not to say
anxiety, by the islanders.
REMINISCENCES OF CANNING.
Some Peculiarities of the Great Knglish
Statesman.
Some of Mr. Canning's "fads I well re
member. For instance, he knew the
French language weli, but nothing could
induce him to pronounce it proDerly; he
pronounced ail the words as if "hey were
Engilsh. I know not what reason he gave
for this, or whether he gave any. It was
his way, and he would not alter it. He
had also some queer ideas ' about spelling.
He was generally averse to the letter f,
and I have seen notes to my father in
i which the word fat was spelt "phat," and
other words in a similar manner. He as
serted that this was the correct method of
spelling. : v''/:;"
I will here endeavor to describe Mr. Car
mine's dress. . I well remember how he was
attired one evening in the summertime:
nankeen tights, narrowed toward the
ankle, and fastened there somehow ; nan
keen â¢ waistcoat,- blue, perhaps about a
shade darker than Oxford blue; tail coat;
a broad pleated cambric frill all down the
shirt-front; his watch in a "fob," or little
pocket, in the trousers, with his chain
and seals dangling. (I forget whether he
bad a gold chain or the more common
ribbon. I incline to think it was a ribbon.
A stiff "watered" ribbon, generally blue,
was much worn at f that period.") The
morning dress had the same sort of coat,
but real trousers, not drawn in at the
ankle. . -
At the period I am speaking of, about
1819 or lb'2o, gentlemen generally wore in
the evening kneebreccbes, black, with long
black silk stockings, and very small buckets
on their shoes; but very soon after that
date all the young men in the evening wore
trousers, leaving the other costume to their
elders, and speedily the generality of the
elders followed suit. But for riding, as even
to this day in the hunting fields, shorts and
topboots were common, though I never saw
my lather in these, great rider as he was,
as ha always rode in trousers fastened
under the feet with leather straps. Soon
these straps became the fashion for gentle
men all day long. Gradually, very gradu
ally, the frock coat superseded the â¢"swal
low-tail" for morning wear, the blue some
times changed to brown, and the gilt but
tons disappeared, to give place to euch as
are worn to this day. By the year 1824 or
1825, I think, men's dress was very much
as it is now, except that the waist is now
rather longer; but it was not so short in
in old days as the caricaturists make it out
to have been.â Temple Bar.

SOME OF THE QUEER NAMES
THAT NEWSPAPERS TAKE.
BY "W. O. MORROW.
A new paper calling itself the Hen Man
is announced. This makes me wonder
whether a newspaper can be a man and a
man a hen. After this has been settled
tlie next query will be why the paper is to
be devoted to the interests of men who are
hens instead of those who are roosters or
chicks, or why, if the paper is intended
m erely to foster the industry of raising
hens, roosters and chicks, which I take to
be necessary to the business, are excluded.
So long as we have newspapers that are
Breeders and Sportsmen, Stockmen and
Lumbermen these observations of the new
paper's name may appear to be idle satire.
It is legitimate, within bounds, for a news
paper to take the name of the interest which
it serves. For that matter, the new pub
lication has a far more appropriate name
than those of some very old and dignified
papers. We have many in this blessed
country calling themselves Suns, egad !
One, approaching the Creator with more
m odesty, announces that it is a New
Moon, which gives very little light and ia
not nearly so scintillating as the innum
erable Stars that, moved by their great
condescension and magnanimity, have
taken themselves out of Jehovah's crown
to settle upon this poor earth and send
their radiance into the dark ways of men !
It may be that to persons without nerves
or an appreciation of the fitness of things
the pompous names carried by some of the
ne wspapers of this noble country give no
offense, and that even the judicious, who
may have been at one time grieved, have
had their souls calloused by repeated sear
ings; and it may be accordingly that these
foolish names no longer serve to make
their wearers ridiculous. We can become
accustomed to many things.
The titles that are incorrectly used may
be grouped thus:
1. Those which are bombastic or extrav
agant.
2. Those in which metonymy and synec
doche (two very useful rhetorical fig
ures when properly employed) are inap
propriately used.
3. Those in which the title bears no rela
tion to the publication, either literally or
figuratively.
4. Those which are doubled or com
pounded.
b. Those wnich are hackneyed.
As it is more convenient to discuss these
without reference to the order in which I
have placed them (the list being more for
tuegestion than direction) I shall open the
subject at random by recalling a facetious
article which the New York Sun once
published about the title of the Louisville
Courier-Journal. The Sun has a very
short name, of which fact, not its name, it
is prodigiously proud. The article was an
elaborate calculation showing how
many columns of space the Louisville
paper sacrilices annually in mentioning
its own name. A sillier argument could
not t>e imagined. It ia becoming to the
dignity of any newspaper however long its
ni.nie to print it in full; to express it by
initials is not only absurd and undignified,
but confusing as well. It is not the length
of the Courier-Journal's title that is to be
complained of, for it is better to have a
long titie that is sensible than a short one
that is silly. Tlie fault with the Louisville
paper's title is that it is compound. Its
absurdity when so regarded appears at
once. Journal is a perfectly proper name
for a daily paper, for it comes from the
French word jour, meaning day. I am
aware that there is authority for calling
papers other than dailies journals, but I
decline to acknowledge it. Having a
proper litpral name for itself in Journal it
is oarbarous to couple it with a name
employed in a figurative sense, for a news
paper is not literally a courier. But how
ever crude and illogical this title may be
'it is not half so absurd as Sun.
Compound titles have resulted from the
consolidation of two papers having differ
ent names, and both names have been
preserved for commercial reasons â if, on
consolidation, one of the titles should be
dropped, some rascally publisher might in
vade the field with a paper of that name
to the injury of the consolidated interest.
A rational solution of such a ditliculty
would seem to be either legislation pre
venting such usurpation for a reasonable
time, or sufficient self-confidence on the
part of the cjnsolidation to hold its own
against all comers. The perpetuation of a
double title is a confession^of weakness
and a proclamation of bad ta^te and often
of a lack of respect for the English lan
guage.
Imagine, if possible, a comic paper call
ing itself a JudÂ«e! Imagine, too, another'
calling itself Life ! A clown that announces
himself to be either a Judge or to repre
sent the hard and bitter round of life
ceases to be a clown, who must have wit,
and becomes an idiot. Such titles so used
are untruthful.
The Suns. Moons and Star 3 are not the
only bombastic titles that afflict us. We have
Standards, Illuminators, Radiators (Hea
ven save the mark!), Leaders, Pilots,
Globes (which might ba a good name for
a new orange or apple), Tribunes (obso
lete, as well as sententious), Statesmen,
Manifestoes, Palladiums, Mentors and the
like. The Police Gazette is better named
than any of them. At the extreme oppo
site end of the line stand those papers con
tent with the meanest and most contempt
ible of all titlesâ Spy. Happily, we have
no Slanderers, Paul Prys or Maggots. We
are too pjoud for that.
Hackneyed names are abundant. Trie
woods are full of Heralds (a bad name, be
cause a herald is not only archaic, but in
feudal times was a bearer of messages, not
news), Newses, Couriers (bearers of orders,
not news), Bulletins, Posts (meaning let
ter-borne news and excluding telegraphic),
Records, Timeses, Independents (how?),
Enterprises, Reports, Standards, Observ
ers, Registers, Advertisers (not newspa
pers, mind), Gazettes, Sentinels, Beacons,
Leaders, Examiners (that is, receivers, not
news-givers), Expresses (describing papers
whose matter must all be leceived by ex
press, or which themselves are an express),
Unions, Ledgers (a ledeer is solely a book
in which accounts are kept), Advocates,
Arguses, Mirrors (which properly can pre
sent nothing original), Eras (which?),
Bees (because they sting or lay up honey â
which), Opinions, Echoes (same as Mir
rors), Mails (papers that either should not
publish telegraphic news or should be de
livered by carriers), Budgets (that is finan
cial statements made by the administra
tion of a government "to the legislative
body as a basis for the levying of taxes),
Eagles (why not a buzzard or a tomtit here
and there?), Monitors (which must have a
superior order of wisdom), Statesmen (out
of a job), Peoples, Enquirers, Transcripts
(of what?), Reporter?, Telegrams, Tele
erraphs (exclusive of other kinds of news)
Recorders, Witnesses, Spectators, Chroni
cles Champions (of what?). Dailies and
Weeklies (no end), Outlooks and others.
It is allowable, despite some foregoing
parenthetical remarks, to call a thing by
the name of one of ita parts and also to
call a thing by the name of some other
thing of related qualities; but if either
name so chosen is hackneyed, it is disa
greeable and dull, and in metonymy the
relation of qualities should be strict and
evident. The great trouble seems to be
that the names most appropriate for news
papers under these two classes are very
limited in number, so that a publisher has
to choose between an appropriate name
that is hackneyed and an original one that
is absurd.
But it does seem that we need not go so
far afield for &ome of our titles which are
both hackneyed and absurd. We ought to
be satisfied with committing one blunder
in a single word. Take Sun, for instance.
Its adoption means to say that the paper
bearing it sheds light and that this tight
is as brilliant as that of the sun. Yet it is
clear that the light abed by the sun is
physical, while a newspaper can shed
light only in a metaphorical sense. That
confusion, apart from its bombastic char
acter, is reducing the title to a literal ab
surdity as well as absurdity in fact.
There are some unusual titles that are
interesting on analysis. Take Review of
Reviews. We cannot infer from the title
whether the paper is a review that reviews
reviews or is the chief of all reviews.
Hence, it is obscure. Independent may
be either political or religious, and hence
is indefinite. Commercial cannot be any
thing but an adjective, and yet in news
paper titles it is used as a noun.
A paper which calls itself Democrat or
Republican, or by the name of any other
political party, has a smaller commercial
yaiue than one not so named, for the rea
son that if the owner wanted to sell it his
probable purchaser either must belong to
the party bearing that name and willing
to advocate its principles, and thus be one
of a class, or must belong to some other
party and therefore stand in a position to
demand a heavy discount by reason of the
necessity for changing the name. A few
years ago it happened in St. Louis that
two papers of opposing political names
passed into the hands of owners whose
politics were exactly reversed; they had
to change the names of the papers.
Some titles are simply and baldly mawk
ish, among them Golden Mpments, Sun
shine, Happy Hours, Home Treasury,
Household Gem, Sunnyside (more silly
than mawkish), Sea Sheil, Phoenix. Hays
of Light, Golden Rule, Home Defender,
Myrtle, Cheerful Letter, Pansy, Breeze
and the like. The most extraordinary
title in the countrj' is borne by a paper in
New York State. It is Radii. It ought to
have been satisfied as one radius, or
if it wanted to be two, it might have called
itself a diameter; though what any of the
elements of a circle have to do with a
newspaper is the puzzling thing.
A curious custom has arisen among
some papers. It is their emphasizing the
definite article as a part of the title when
they speak of themselves. This is inde
fensible. An altogether unnecessary in
accuracy is for papers published in the
afternoon to call themselves evening
papers. They are not published in the
evening. But why announce that it is
either an afternoon or a morning paper?
Descriptive adjectives in titles may be
made very useful, and it ia an interesting
fact that the best-nainea papers in this
country are those devoted to technical
subjects; it is because they employ adjec
tives intelligently.
THE FLOATING COMMITTEE
Report of the Unique Labors
of the Young Christian
Endeavorers.
Â«
Chairman Henry F. Eden Reports
That Eighty-One Seamen Have
Signed the Pledge.
Henry F. Eden, chairman of the float
ing committee of the Christian Endeavor
Society, has submitted the following report
of the work ox the committee for the past
year: ,
This year has been a year of progress. The
work has been deepening and widening. New
openings for work have been shown us and he
has enabled us to enter these open doors. The
Monday night Christian Kndeavor meetings,
which have been held in the Mariners' Church
by various societies, have been a great blessing
to all. Several seamen have been converted i
through these meetings. The Saturday even- \
ing meeting on ships in the bay have been of
no less importance. The stirring gospel appeals ,
the lively songs, and t*e personal work ac the
close of each meeting by our faithful
workers are already bearing fruit to the
glory of our master. Eighty-one seamen
nave signed our C. E. pledge. Some of these
have been converted in our port while others
have been led into a life of more earnest work
"For Christ and the Church." Fifty-four letters
have been written to absent members, while
forty-four have been received; these have '
brought gladness to our hearts and inspired us
with new zeal. One hundred and seven letters
have been sent on deep-water ships in port.
These letters are of great importance. They
bring before the men of the sea the nature of
our work, give a hearty welcome to our port,
and an invitation to our services, Forty-three
socials have been given on Thursday evenings.
Here we get better acquainted with the men,
and I am sure that every Endeavorer of the !
Golden Gate Union who has helped in these ]
meetings has been blessed personally, and has |
given sunshine to many hearts. Forty-six com- i
fart bags have been sent on outbound snips.
.These little bags contain needles, thread, j
worsted, pins, buttons, darning needles, \
court piaster, a marked Testament and a Chris
tian letter written by the donor, giving the ad
dress so that a letter can be sent back to the
writer, which is often done. This shonid be
the work of our juniors. Let us remember "a
Mttle child shall lead them." A large amount
of reading matter has been donated by differ
ent societies. These silent messengers are
now scattered over the sea, and are accom
plishing the mission to which they are sent.
A Thanksgiving dinner was given, on which
occasion the Holy Spirit was very evidently
present. To him be all the glory! An
indebtedness of $55 has been paid on a
piano which we now own, and an organ
for our Saturday night boat work on
the bay has been very generously do
nated by Messrs. Benj. Curtaz <fe Sons. Tota.l
amount donated and collected during the year,
8145 85 ; expended $139 30; balance on hand,
$7 55. In conclusion let me say that we are
now paying from $12 to $15 per month for
â¢boat hire. We need a launch of our own. Our
boat committee, faithful in its efforts to raise
funds for this launch, still need $1000. Who
will lay up treasures in heaven ? There is not
a more noble work than to hold services on the
incoming and outgoing ships. The devil is
sparing neither time nor money to reach both
officers and seamen of these ships. Shall it be
said of us that "the children of this world in
their generation are wiser tfian the children
of light" ?

Obey be used
in the Marriage Service?
fc*"r|^aHEÃE has been a reaction of sen-
THERE has been reaction of sen
timent since our mothers and
[I grandmother? knelt before the al-
JJL tar and blushingly promised to
"obey" their husbands.
The first of the new women, or such of
them as chanced to take the marriage vow,
objected to the word. "It was a relic of
barbarism," they declared, and they in
augurated a campaign against the an
achronism that has almost resulted in its
annihilation.
Witness, lor Instance, the views of some
of San Francisco's representative preach
ers.
Dr. W. W. Case, pastor of the Howard-
Ftreot Methodist Church, is nothing if not
emphatic.
"We do not require a vow of obedience,"
he said. "The women wouldn't keep it,
anyhow, so what's the use. We avoid
everything that is unnecessary. Besides
it is a matter of principle with us. Woman
was made from man's rib in order that she
might walk by his side.
"It is abominable to ask a woman to
obey the man just as it would be to ask a
man to obey a woman. The effect of such
a promise would be to stultify woman.
"What go I thinic of 'Paul's advice'?
That it is misunderstood."
The position of Rev. W. P. Boynton,
naMor of the First Baptist Church, would
satisfy the demands of the newest of new
woman.
i can see no reason why women should !
assume obligations to obey any more than
men should," he said. "I have us-ed tne
word but once in performing a marriage
ceremony, and that was wiien a nice little ,
woman asked me to do so.
"I believe in a common purse in the
home. I believe in comnlete confidence
there, that the wife should have no secret
from the husband, nor the husband from
the wife. A liberal and fair interpretation
of the scriptural teaching relating to mar
riage shows that the charges to the hus
band are practically synonymous with I
those made to the wife."
"A relic of the dark ages" is what Rev.
J. dimming Smith, pastor of Trinity Pres- j
byterian Church, pronounced the old mar- ;
riage service.
â 'Most men give no thought to the phrase
ology of the service," i^aiii Mr. .Smith,
"but tne man who insists that his bride
adopt the formula pledging her to obedi
ence I regard as a coward, speaking for i
myself 1 that there are strong reasons, i
. ;ral and common sense, why a'
in should not be compelled to proru
-150 to obey. As lar as I know Paul is the
only one responsible for such advice as
'Wives be submissive to your husbands,' i
and 'Women, keep silence in the churches.' !
You know Paul was an old bachelor, a 9
well as one of the most intellectual men of
his time, and he could not rise entirely
above its prejudices, one of which was
that women should live in seclusion.
Furthermore, it was a matte^of policy, for
if women asserted any of the independence
of thought and action that characterize
the Christian woman of our day the paeans
of their time would have pronounced them
'off color.'
"I cannot say that the Presbyterian
church is a unit in the matter. In fact
Dr. Hodge's manual, which is an authority
to many of my ministerial brethren, in
cludes the word 'obey' in its form for the
marriage ceremony ana a quod many still
follow it."
"The form of rnamage in vogue for so
long a time and which is being superseded
by formulae adopted by the churches and
modiliea by the ministers, is not up to the
light of the present." said Rev. W. 1).
Williams of Plymouth Congregational
Church. If a candidate lor wifehood
asks me to use it, or rather if she insists
upon it I do, but lam averse to it. It will
i:-'tbear the fire of criticism. It was de
â¢â¢â â ^iied for the time when people lived like

STORY
OF A SIGN.
How Pete Sales Made Cap
ital Out of Accusations
Against His Honesty.
Pete Sales, the butcher, is dead. At
least that is what all of his old friends and
neighbors say, and they ought to know.
The sad event caused a feeling of genuine
regret in the vicinity of Broadway and
Montgomery avenue, where Pete had lived
for over a quarter of a century.
Years ago Pete was a prominent man,
liked by everybody for his jolly good na
ture and keen appreciation of a joke. He
had a porkstore on the corner of Dupont
and Adler streets, that was then the only

"You ask, Should a woman promise to
obey?" said Rev. Hobart Cbetwood.
"Now, did you ever hear of the man who
did promise to "obey? Never? Weil, it's
a fact. A university professor living not
a hundred miles from here promised to
obey his wife. lean answer for the prom

"You see, the clergyman who officiated
at the wedding ceremony was exceedingly
absent-minded. He had one of his fre
quent lapses while he was joining the pair.
He repeated the proper formula for the
" A nice little woman asked me to use the word in
her marriage service," said Rev. M. P. Boynton.
"Kcverence includes obedience; therefore while we
do not use the lesser term In the service the greater

one in the neighborhood except those kept
by Chinese. Pete did a line business and
his customers were always pleased, al
though it was whispered that he had a
habit of converting struy cats into the
most delicious sausage, and circumstantial
evidence tended to prove the fact.
On one occasion a well-known newspa
per man caught Pete in the actof purchas
ing a number of half-starved cats from
some street urchin. He asked a few
pointed questions and found that Pete was
in the habit of buying all the cats he could
get. Furthermore, he was told that the
cats were kept about the shop until they
got fat. when they were killed and made
into the finest grades of weinersvurst. Pete
had even been heard to state that cat meat
was superior to pork. It was whiter and
had a liner flavor.
Tl;e newspaper man published all the
facts he had learned in a morning paper,
fully expecting that Pete would be in a
rage on account of it. But instead he was
pleased, Â»nd even looked upon, the article
as a ;rood advertisement.
Not long afterward Pete had a new sign
put on top of his building, that at once
became famous. People flocked from all
directions to see it. The sign was gigantic

the clergyman interrogatively. The groom

man looked appealingly at the clereyman,
but the faraway look in the good "man's
eyes sent his spirits to the freezing point.
'Oh, very well, then, 'to obey,' " he
gasped. The bride made the same promise
without any hesitancy. The guests looked
politely unconscious, and the clergyman
was blissfully ignorant of the blunder

until his wife made him
aware of it after they
reached the seclusion of
their home.
"Seriously speaking,"
continued Mr. Chetwood,
"I would refuse to mnrry
a couple if the bride
would refuse to obey. It
is a part of the church
ritual and I would have
no right to omit it. One
of our clergymen turned
away from "the altar and

YOUNG WOMEN WHO WORK.
Is Business Kmployment Demoralizing
' to the Fair Sex?
The fact cannot be disputed that no sin
gle factor in modern life is doing so much
to degenerate our young womanhood as
this mad race on thepartof girls, impelled i
by necessity or not, to go into the business !
work!. These may sound like strong j
words to the ears of some, but to those
who are really cognizant of the immensity I
of the evil results that are being wrought i
they will simply fit the case- and not go j
beyond it. In altogether too many of our j
commercial and industrial establishments,
stores and factories, the men into whose j
hands is given the power to employ and j
control girls are not lit, from a moral j
standpoint, to herd swine.
And yet thousands of our young women
are allowed to go from their homes to j
work under the influence of these men i
and in the atmosphere vitiated by them, i
And why? Simply because it is consid
ered more "respectable" to be employed
in an office, store or factory than to been
ga^." din domestic service. The very word
"servant" has a taint about it that the ma
jority of young women dislike, and from
which they flee. But what else are they
in business establishments than servants
pure and simple? There can be no differ
ence but an imaginary one. That is all.
Far less leniency is . shown in our business
houses to women employes than is shown,
as a rule, in our homes to domestic help â
infinitely less.
It is the Dot-and-kettle idea that seems
so painfully unrespectable to thousands of
young women and. perhaps, they arc not
so much to blame when one considers the
depth to which the idea of domestic ser
vice has been allowed to sink in America.
Just so long as the well-to-do parents of
our country discourage the idea of house
hold knowledge in their daughters, as so
many do, just so increasingly d-ifhcult will
these same parents find it to secure good
domestic servants for their homes. Make
a thing undesirable to one class ana you
quickly make it unre3pectable to another
class. "We all like to ape the ideas and
manners of those whom we fancy to be a
lirtle above us in birth or station. Here is
where the great evil to domestic service
has been done and is being wrought. It
has been made purely and lowly menial
and the result is that youne women, com
pelled to earn their living, have sought
other avenues, which, with their inexperi
ence, they fancy are more desirable or ele
vating.âLadies'Home Journal.
Our Ships the Best.
The Vulcan. 6629 tons, with a radius of
action of 12,600 miles at ten knots an hour,
or 8000 at eighteen Knots, is regarded as
one of the most capable ships in the
British navy. Her French compeer is the
Tage, 7255 tons, which has a radius of GSOO
miles at ten knots. The Italia, 15,000 tons,
italy's best ship, has a. coal capacity of
8036*railes at ten knots an hour. From
tnis it will be seen that no European navy
has any vessel that can compare with the
Oregon and other vessels of the United
States navy, which can steam 16,000 miles
at ten knots an hour.

A GARDEN ON A WHARF.
Pleasing: but Unusual Sight on the
Banks of Oakland Creek.
Land is so plentiful in California that
such a thing as a garden on a wharf is a
most unusual sight. But there is one on
the banks of Oakland Creek, close to the
shipyards, and it gives a pleasing bit of
color to the practical and barren surround
ings.
The garden belongs to Mrs. McLaren,
wife of Al McLaren, the boat-builder. Al
has been there a long time, and once there
was no garden on the wharf where he
does his wortc. That was before he got
married and brought his wife to make her
home where he had made his for years.
The first thing Mrs. McLaren wanted
was a garden, as she had been used to
flowers all her life. But there was ap
parently no place to make one, as all the
land about the house that was not covered
with boats in course of construction was
barren sand. She grew a few flowers m

THE GOLD PRODUCT.
Likely to Bo Larger Than Ever for the
Next -'.Fifty Years.
It is now evident that the production of
gold for the " next fifty years will be alto

has been vigorously stimulated by fresh
discoveries of . mines, by new and cheap '
mining processes and by the ; fall of silver,
leading miners to pay greater attention to

Rev. J. Cumming Smith.
] pots for a long time until the idea struck
I her that a portion of the wharf could be
used for a garden.
Al accordingly hauled several wagon
J loads of good soil and spread it several
I feet thick oVer the place where it looked
; to Mrs. McLaren as if it would do the
j most good. The garden was a success
from the start. The warm, moist air of the
j marsh was just what the flowers wanted,
and they blossomed in great profusion.
Mrs. McLaren has taken full charge of
the garden and done all of the work her
| self. She has planted several palms that
! have turned out well, and a number of
j rosebushes that are always covered with
i bright colored blossoms. The garden is
! on the southern side of the house, and cx
i tends baclc over the waters of the creek.
| A rustic seat has been built amid the
j flowers, and on warm days the lady of the
house takes her sewing there and, as she
says, "enjoys life." Al says that he often
misses the appropriated portion of the
wharf when he has a certain kind of work
to do, but thinks that his wife has put it
to a better use than ever he did.
latter factor is best seen in Colorado,
where the production of gold rose from
$5,300,000 in 1802 to $7,527,000 in 1893 and
to about $12,000,000 in 1894. The produc
tion for 1895 in Coloiado is confidently ex
pected to reach $20,000,000. The Director of
the Mint is of the opinion that the produc
tion of the United States rose from $33 -
014,981 in 1892 to about $39,500,000 in 1894,
while other pood authorities put the pro
duction for 1894 at $50,000,000. The annual
product of other great producing countries
shows a large increase of late years. In
bis notable article in tho North "American
addressed to the bride and groom except
as to gender."
"The custom of requiring a promise of
obedience from a bride arises from New
Testament teaching," said Rabbi Voor
sanger. "No such vow was ever included
in the simple wedding service of the Jews,
a service that unites a man and woman on
a plane of equality."
"The old or so-called orthodox branch of
the Lutheran church insists that a bride
shall promise to obey her husband, but the
liberal does not," said Rev. J. Fuendeiing,
pastor of St. Mark's Lutheran Church. "I
have never used the word in our ritual
either in this country or Europe.
"The scriptural injunction may have
heen a necessary precautionary measure at
the time it was pronounced, but does not
apply in this age of civilization. Ido not
like to think of marriage as the bondage or
servitude that a vow of obedience implies.
It should be a relation characterized by
tenderness.' '
Rev. A. J. Wells, pastor of the Second
Unitarian Church, said the use of the
word "obey" in the marriage service -was
"repugnant to manly feeling." Said lie:
"My experience for twenty-rive years is
that woman is generally and unqualifiedly
opposed to the use of the word obey in the
marriage service. My own custom has
been all my life to leave it out. It is re
pugnant to manly feeling, i. c., to a true
reverence for woman. It is a relic of a time
gone by, when woman was either a toy or
a slave, when man considered her in some
sort his property. Perhaps a relic of that
bygone time remains in the language of
ignorant menâ a Southern phrase, I think
it is â 'My woman.' As to woman's posi
tion, it is not wholly due to the Bible.
Early Christianity taught woman subjec
tion. 'Let her learn in silence in all sub
jection,' Paul said. It was not until Chris
tianity found GreeK refinement on ita way
to the West and met there t!>e superior
reverence for woman among the Teutonic
races that Europe began to show her due
respect.
"Both human slavery and the subjection
of woman can be vindicated by the text of
the Bible and the practice of early Chris
tianity. The new woman is the producer
of many forces, and while in some forms
in whith she appears to-day she is not
wholly lovable these extremes will pass.
Steadily she is securing her rights and
assuming her privileges, and as she does
so some of the evils of our social, indus
trial and political life will disappear."
The views of the Mormons or Latter-day
Saints on the question were voiced by
Henry S. Tanner, the president of the
California division of that church.
The sect employs the mooted word in its
ceremony, and President Tanner justifies
its use in thiswise: "We believe the mar
riage covenant is eternal, through the holy
spirit of promise, and if the contracting
persons have properly complied with all
the requirements the Lord makes of them
they are bound together forever. A3
Christ is bound to the church and the
church to him, so the man is bound to the
woman and the woman to the man. By
mutual consent Christ stands at the head
of the church and the man at the head of
the family, its strengtn and support. We
do not consider it arbitrary power on the
part of Christ to require obedience from
the church because we have willingly ac
cepted him as that head, knowing him to
be kind and just and willing to protect his
own.
"So men and women should be consider
ate and make proper selections, that their
obligations may be kept in righteousnet-a
and that reproach may not come upon the
marriage relation, iiarnane is ordained
of God unto mm for the purpose of pro
creation, that the earth might answer the
end of its creation, an;i joy, happiness,
confidence and Jove reicrn in the hearts of
the people. Something is wrong if a
woman ODeys her husband through fear or
oppression. One or the other, or both,
are failing to comply with their sacred
obligations."
Bishop Nicholas, the chief authority at
the Kusso-Greek cathedral, says the new
woman's tabooed word is not used in the
marriage service of the Greek church. The
bride is asked, "Is it your hrm intention
to take this man for your husband?" If
she replies in the affirmative she is asked
whether she "has avowed any other man."
There is no promise to obey in those
vows, but in the prior chartre of the offi
ciating priest she is told that she muse
reverence her husband. "Ileverence in
cludes obedience," said Bishop Nicholas,
"therefore, while we do not use tne lesser
term in the service the greater one ab
sorbs and implies it. In the Russian
church it is regarded as a woman's duty
to yield obedience to her husband's author
ity. My opinion as to the scriptural
grounds for that belief? It is not a mat
ter of opinion. The command stands as
it did the day it was written. Greek Cath
olics have not changed an iota of it, so
there can be no mistake as to the intention
of the writer. St. Paul is the authority on
the subject.
"The implication of obedience on the part
of the wife occurs also in the prayer read
by the priest during the marriage service."
Review Mr. Preston states that the world's
production of gold for 1803 '-was the largest
in history, amounting in round numbers
to $155,522,000." The product for 19<M,
however, very largely exceededâ probably
by 25 per centâ the product of 1893. There
is scarcely any assignable limit to the gold,
known to exist in the world, or even in
the United States. It is said that
simply by the removal of the restrictions
on hydraulic mining California can pro
duce half a billion of gold. The quantity
easily obtainable in Colorado is stupen
dous. Otfeer parts of the United States are
also rich, while Australia and Russia prob
ably possess a stock equal to our own", and
are increasing the annual output every
year.
But the most surprising and, so to
speak, revolutionary facts regarding gold
that have recently come to light are those
concerning the great Witwatersraud mines
of South Africa. There gold is found [in
enormous quantities and in a cheaply
workable form in a new geological situa
tion â "in strata the compontnt parts of
which are pieces of quartz held together
by a clayey cement."â Popular Science

THE BEST PAID POET.
James Smith Likely Received the
Highest Amount Per Line.
It has been said that James Smith, one
of the authors of the celebrated "Rejected
Addresses," was better paid for a trifling
exertion of his versatile muse than any
poet since the world began. One day he
met Mr. Stranan, the King's printer, at a
dinner party, wiiom he found suffering
from gout and old age, though his intel
lectual faculties remained unimpaired,
and the next morning he transmitted him
the following jeu d'esprit:
Your lower limbs seem'd far from stout
When last I saw you walk;
The cause I presently found out
When you began to talk.
Tho power that props the body's length
Jn due proportion spread.
In you mounts upward, and the strength
All settles in the head.
This compliment proved so highly ac
ceptable to the old' gentleman that he
made an immediate codicil in his will, by
which he bequeathed to the writer the
sum of Â£3000, being at the rate of Â£375 for
each line.

OCIETY has had a busy week.
(J^^L Wedding?, luncheons, teas, re
ceptions, dinners and dances have
4^=Â»^ followed one another in bewilder
ing succession, keeping the de
votees of fashion ou the continual "go."
Paderewski also has claimed a large
share of society's attention; in fact the
celebrated maestro was entirely account
able for the slim attendance at the Mon
day Night Dancing Class.
There was one prominent engagement
announced during the week, with the pros
pect of a brilliant Easter wedding. The
interested parties are Miss Fannie Crocker,
daughter of Mrs. Clark W. Crocker, ana
Robert Clark McCreary of Sacramento.
Quite a number of pleasant little enter

this young couple. On Thursday evening
Mr. and Mrs. Henry J. Crocker gave a
dinner in their honorâ a charming family
affairâ and on Tuesday Mr. and Mrs. Van

Crocker.
Miss Rose Hooper entertained forty-two
of her young friends at dinner at the Occi
dental last evening, after which the party,
with Mrs. Hoot>er as chaperon, went to
the Tivoli.
After the play hostess and guests re
paired once more to the Occidental, whore
a "Dutch" supper was served. The guests
were seated at seven round tables and
washed down such palatable food as sau
sage, pretzels, etc., with Rhine wine and
beer.
Another charming Tivoli party last
evening was the one given by Major and
Mr?. Darling complimentary to the Misses
Bee and Ethel Hooper. There were ten
young people in the party, and after the
play there was supper at the University
Club.
On Friday Miss Edith McÃean enter
tained nine of her young friends at
luncheon at the Hotel Richelieu. The
table was prettily decorated with violets
and daffodils, and an elaborate and de
licious menu enjoyed.
Among the delightful luncheons of the
week was the one given on Tuesday at the
University Club by Miss Emma Butier.
The tables were decorated with violets and
daffodils, and covers laid for thirty. Miss

Leap year has not found the gentlemen
altogether unprepared. Taking advantage
of the off year Lieutenant Joyce, assisted
by ten brother officers, gave a delightful
tea at the Presidio on Friday afternoon.
The decorations were all in red â the artil
lery colorâ and through the courtesy of
General Graham the Presidio band fur
nished the music. The hours of the tea
were from 4 to 6, during which time the
gallant officer? entertained their 300 guests
in a manner that excited the approval as
well as the envy of their fair friends.
The Misses Bee and Ethel Hooper, who
at preseut are the guests of Major and
Mrs. Darling at the Presidio, were ten
dered a delightful serenade on Wednesday
evening. The Presidio band furnished the
music, and all the cottagers, with lighted
lanterns swung over their shoulders, as
sembled on the lawn adjoining the
Darling cottage.
On Monday the Misses Graham will give
a tea at the Presidio in honor of the Misses
Hooper.
Quite the most elaborate entertainment
of the week was .the musicale yesterday
given by Mrs. Cunningham at her elegant
residence on Paciiic avenue. All the ele
gant apartments on the ground floor were
thrown open to the guests, and decorated
with flowers and ferns. Yellow was the
prevailing shade, and consequently costiy
vases, exquisite crystal bowls and every
variety of elegant receptacles for blossoms
were tilled with golden daffodils.
The large billiard room was for the occa
sion converted into a music room, and the
potted palms and ferns that were artistic
ally arranged about the apartment were a
cool and delightful contrast to the wealth
of tropical foliage and rare exotics in the
conservatory adjoining. After the music
there were delicious refreshments. |

THE DEAD BURGLAR.
Several Persons Offer Opinions :is to
the Identity of the
Man.
Several persons called at the Morgue
yesterday and offered opinions as to the
identity of the burglar who was shot and
killed by Frank J. Miller at the residence
of J. L. Franklin, 2930 California street,
cany Saturday morning.
F. O. Jacques, living at 910 Pacific
street, declared that the dead man was
known to him as "Frisco Slim." He knew
the deceased as a tramp, and it was only
a short time ago when he met him in the
country.
P. K. Eickhorst, in whose saloon at
Greenwich and Pierce streets Frank Nev
ille, a carpenter, was shot and killed on
November 17 last, says that the dead
burglar was Neville's slayer.
Captain Lees, however, asserts that the
saloon man is mistaken, that the murderer
of Neville is still alive, and he hopes some
day to arrest and convict him of the
crime.
The body is still at the Morgue. It was
viewed by hundreds of people yesterday.
MALONEY CHARGES FRAUD
The Turfman Sues Colonel Theo
dore C. Marceau, the
Photographer.
Says He Paid $223 Under Duress and
Through Fraudulent Repre
sentations.
A suit was riled in the Justices' Court
yesterday against Colonel Theodore C.
Marceau, the photographer, in which the
ex-National Guardsman is charged with
fraudulently obtaining a warrant for the
arrest of J. H. Maloney, the turfman.
Maloney ordered a quantity of photo
graphs from Marceau in March, 1895, and
refused to accept them when they were de
livered on the ground that they were a
strikingly poor likeness an.l badly finished.
On March 30, when he was about to leave
the Palace for tiie train on which he was
to depart for the East, he was arrested on
a warrant sworn out by Marceau* charging
him with the intention of leaving the
State to defraud his creditors.
While under arrest he say 3 that the pho
tographer took advantage of the fact that
he had fully arranged to leave at once for
the East on important business and had no
time to delay and consult an attorney and
extorted $223 from him as payment for the
pictures in spite of his violent protest.
Ho was gone six months, and now sues
for the return of the $223 alleged to have
been paid under duress. The complaint
tiled yesterday was in part as follows:
That plaintiff's intention so to depart from
said City and County of San Francisco was
well known and understood by said defendant,
and that said defendant, taking advantage of
said plaintiff's intention to depart from San
Francisco as aforesaid, and fraudulently con
triving to harass, oppress and annoy this plain
tiff and by means of force and coercion to ex
tort from plaintiff the sum of money herein
after mentioned, he, the said defendant, com
menced an action in the Justices' Court of the
City and County of San Francisco against the
plaintiff herein, falsely charging that this
plaintiff was indebted to the defendant nerein
in the sum of $223 in lawful money of the
United States. â¢ 1 ..-j>v :. Â
That said defendant herein on said 30th day
of March, 1895, fraudulently made and caused
to be riled in said action an affidavit wherein
said delendant falsely charged that the plain
tiff herein was indebted to said defendant
herein in the sum ot |223, and that
this plaintiff intended to leave the State
of California for the purpose and with the in
tention to cheat and defraud him, the said de
fendant, out of the said sum of money and
thereupon and thereby the said deiendant by
means of such false and fraudulent state
ments and representation*, procured an order
for the arrest of this plaintiff to be issued out
of the Jubtices' Court.
Ttie complaint also denies that the sum
of $223 is due Marceau, and demands the
return of the money. In his answer to
Marceau's suit, tiled a few days ago, he in
timated that he would sue the photog
rapher for $25,000 damages for the arrest.
FOB A GENERAL CLEAN-UP
The Civic Federation Still Deter
mined to Suppress the
Dives.
Hopes to Secure Conviction in the
Pending Pool-Selling CaseâOffi
cers on Guard.
Rev. Thomas Filben, chairman of the
committee on public morals of the Civic
Federation, in an interview yesterday con
cerning the latest case brought against
the pool-sellers, said he had hopes of a
conviction, as the case met all the points
upon which the Messenger case failed.
The ticket in this case, he said, was
bought fifteen minutes to 4 o'clock, imme
diately before the race was run, leaving no
room for the defense that the money had
been carried to the track and there placed
on the horse. Besides, no commission
was paid. Then it was a 5-cent bet and
the lowest bet taken at the track is $1.
In the event of a favorable decision in
this case the federation purposes to insist
on arrests being made on the same lines
and prosecution Kept up until the business
is stopped.
"The Civic Federation," continued Mr.
Filben, "is working to bring about a gen
eral clean-up, to remove the odium that
the City suffers from the flaunting of vice
in the public eye. We have instituted a
close watch on the poker games, pool
rooms and dives Generally. We have
already put a blockade on Morton street.
We have operated successfully against the
show places in the tenderloin and China
town.
"These places are not in operation as
they were a year or more ago. In this
work we havethe police and public with
US. "We have been working quietly, seek
ing an end rather than an advertisement
on the way.
"We are somewhat disappointed at the
outcome of the ordinance against poker
games. District Attorney Barnes prom
ised, if the ordinance failed in any partic
ular, he would prepare another, until he
got one that did hold. So we expect to
see a new one introduced at the next meet
ing of the Board of Supervisors."
Lord Lcmsdale's hobby is to collect

MEW YORK GIRL WORKERS
Bab Tells of the Philanthropy
of Mrs. Dudlap Hop
kins.
HER GRAND SCHOOL OF DESIGN.
What It Is Doing for All Classes
of Ambitious Ycung
Women.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Feb. 11, 1896.-An
other woman letter. But it is to that girl
woman who is doing the work of a man,
and gettingâ well, she gets encourage
ment from her woman friends, and she has
the somewhat doubtful pleasure of hoping
for gratitude in the hereafter. I don't
know how many there areâ l am always
off where numbers are concerned â but
leaving out the girls in the shops and the
pirls in the big factories, there are hun
dreds of girls in New York either earning
their living or studying to make their
living with a pen, a pencil, or the paint
brush, on the violin, on the piano, or with
that most beautiful of all instruments the
human voice. And usually these girls
are alone. They come flocking in by the
hundreds, hoping as only a girl-woman
can hope, with bright eyes and glowing
cheeks, for success. Then they started to
work, only to discover that it is nearly all
work and very little play. That pretty
girl who lived in a small "townâ well, we
will call her Dolly Brightnessâ developed
remarkable abiiity to sketch everybody
she saw; her pictures were the delight of
the neighborhood; she caricatured all the
villagers from the preacher in the pulpit to
the funny old doctor and to the small boys
in the back pew, who went to sleep, and
caricatured them good-naturedly. Then
she painted flowers so well that the neigh
bors declared you could notteliher roses
from the real ones. Little by little enough
money was saved for her to come to New
York and study.
She landed at one of the big stations
with a bunch of goldenrod, her bag and
two bundles, and for the first time she be
gan to realize that she was going to be a
stranger in a strange land. The cable-car
took her to the house where board had been
engaged for her, tne place that was to be
her future home; a hall bedroom on the
four:h floor. The windows were half the
size of those on the floor below, and only
one belonged to her room. There was a
folding bed, wby, I don't know, as nobody
younger than Dolly's grandfather would
have been allowed in her room, and even
her grandfather would have had to have
brought a certificate proving his relation
ship to satisfy the landlady, since her idea
was always to believe the wrong about a
young girl. Then there was a rattly old
bureau with keyholes, but no keys, a tiny
basin Dig enough for the bath of a small
kitten, but not for that of a well-grown
girl, while the jug had its 'nose broken as
if it had got 'disgusted with the smel
of stale water.
There was one chair, but as the land
lady gleefully said, "This room, Miss, is
heated." A gloomy-looking register sug
pested that fact. But when the day came
that suggested that a whiff of warm air
wouid be desirable Dolly opened tne reg
ister and got, not heat but the accumulat
ed smells o! the various dishes that had
been cooked in that house for the last
seven years. For this room there was
paid $7 a week, which left Dolly with $3
for her expenses. And Dolly, by the by,
had much more than the average girl.
The parlor, which reminded one of a
cemetery vault, had a little sign on the
door which said, "Ladies are expected to
receive the friends here. Tne gas is put
out at 10 o'clock." Why it was called the
parlor puzzled Dolly, for she never heard
anybody talk there all that long winter;
when anybody did go in they spoke in
whisDers and behaved as if there was won
der as to the corner in which the coffin
stood.
While she was working it was all very
well, but Dolly was only human, and she
wanted a little play. She couldn't have it
there. It is true, once in a while some of
the other girls climbed up the stairs and
visited her in the hall room, but that was
not a comfortable visit, since Dolly had to
let the bed down so that her jruests might
have something to sit on, and that left no
room in which to be sociable. Once she
told me that she believed her desire to en
joy herself would get the better of her
some night, and that she would walk out
on the streets and look in the shop win
dows. What will become of Dolly if she
does that? My friend, do you know what
Iwond*r? It is this: That more girls do
not go to the devil, straight. It is a beau
tiful tribute to their innate goodness tnat
so many of them can look into their
mothers faces and by that look convince
them of their purity and their goodness.
But this is all leading up to another
story. When a woman is old and rich
and ugly it seems as if nature intended
her for a philanthropist. But when she is
young and handsome and rich and doesn't
call herself a philanthropist, but does the
work of a real one, then she is â what?
Yes, you have said itâ a gift of God. When
the New York School of Technical Design
was started by Mrs. DunlaD Hopkins her
friends laughed, and thought it the fad of
a pretty woman tired of society; but time
proved that if this was a fad, fads were
good things, since it resulted in a school
where, for a comparatively small sum, a
girl may learn to do work with her pencil,
or her brush, or with clay; to do work
that will sell. Not such work as we too
often see, amateurish to the last degree,
and sold by some kindly woman, who
doesn't realize the harm she is doing the
real workers, but who, because somebody
needs it, gets $25 for a painted plaque that
deserves to be thrown in the tire.
The philanthropy of Mrs. Hopkins' work
consisted in making girls understand that
their work was only worth what it would
fetch in the market, and not the sum
given by their friends, or at church raffles.
Well, year after year the school grew,
until now it stands a monument to tne
wonderful brain and loving heart of one
woman.
It is free of debt. From it have come
forth the brightest women architects in
this country. From it, every week, are
sola at the best prices they will bring de
signs for carpet-weaving, designs for wall
paper and designs for book-covers. The
girl who draws carpet designs has learned
her work artistically and practically; she
knows how the thread works through
the loom for a certain kind of car
pet, and she knows the colors and pat
terns that are most salable, and upon
which the greatest profit will be made.
So it is through every department. Each
girl knows that her work will be judged
absolutely according to its merit; conse
quently she works, not only to bean arrist
but to be a money-maker. The girl artist
in the past has, I am sorry to say, too
often been a money-beggar," inasmuch as
ahe expected to get many times the value
of her picture, because she was a woman.
I believe in every consideration being
shown to women by men, but when a
man's work and a woman's work stand
side by side let the buyer forget*vhich was
the woman's and which the m^#:"s and buy
that which is the best. But to return to
the school. There is also in this building
a lunchroom where for a small price the
worker can get what the worker always
needsâ a hot meal in the middle of the
day.
Somebody asks: "What does Mr?. Dun
lap HoDkins get out of all this? Noth
ing. That is, nothing in the worldly
sense. Her time and her money have
been given and given generously, and she
is satisfied if her work is a success. That
it is, it proves, but another tribute to it is
the fact that in London they are eetiin<Â»
up a school just like it and Mrs. Hopkins
is teaching the kindly Princess Christian,
the most broad-minded of the Queen's
daughters, to model a school after this one
in New York.
But now the girls clamor for more.
They say: "You have given us a working
place, give us a home! Take us out of
hall bedrooms, let us realize that we are
human beings who know how to live and
enjoy as well as to work; give us a home!"
And the answer to this is that the New
York Model Building Company, which is
incorporated and consists of two women
architects, Miss Gannon, Miss Hand,
Mrs. Davis and the New York School
of Technical Design, expect to have
that home ready in a year. It will not be
way up beyond Harlem, but it will be in
the heart of the city, and, thank heaven, it
will be so built that sunshine can reach
each room and be lived in. For sunshine
makes healthy women. The prices range
in this way: For a bedroom, a sitting
room and a bath, the three rooms to De
occupied by one woman, the charge will
be $5 a week. The bedroom is a good
sized one, is light, and so is the parlor,
but they are not, of cdurse, the largest
rooms in the hotel. For two connecting
bedrooms, two parlors and a bathroom,
rooms that are to be' occupied by two
women, the price will be $3 apiece a week.
For two bedrooms that are much larger,
two parlors that are much larger and a
very large bathroom, a suite which two
women will also occupy, there will be
made the charge of $5 each per week. The
restaurant prices are to be reasonable, and
it is calculated that the entire cost of liv
ing will be but a little more than that paid
for a hall bedroom, and need only, if one
so wishes, be as much. But the comfort
gained will be wonderful. I saw the de
sign, and I know about this. There is the
money ready to do it.
But still there is another story, and that
is the one that appeals to me. lam not a
believer in women's clubs, but I am a be
liever in women helping one another. So
the busy architects have drawn a design
for a clubhouse where there will be a
library, a reading-room, a gymnasium,
several reception-rooms and one large
room giver over to the times when there
are special meetings or special entertain
ments. Many of New York's richest
women have given not only their approval
Out their money to this scheme, and are
gladly acting on the various committees.
A generous civer concealing his or her
name has presented to the club a farm
called "Twilight Park," up in the
nearby country where the girls can no
for their vacations, when the so-called
"Cabin" is built. But to return to the
club. It is meant to be for those girl
women who are artists, writers or musi
cians, or who are studying any kind of
work and are alone. It is meant to work
somewhat in this way; there will be a
committee on hospitality and some other
committee with a kindly name, which I do
not remember, and when, at any school,
the news comes of a student to appear
to-morrow, that student will tind "upon
her arrival two or three girls eager in their
greetings, and one of them will accom
pany her to her abiding place.
In this way the stranger will not risk
getting on a car for Harlem when she
wants to co to Twenty-third street or
standing dazed, frightened and alone, a
prey for sharpers. The club cirl will
tell her what it is wisest for her
to do, help her a bit about her
arrangements, invite her -to the next
social meeting of the club, and in
time she will make a place for herself.
This club is not going to inquire "Are you
a Catholic or a Protestant? is there tainted
blue blood in your veins, or healthy red?
Are you rich or are you poor?" But in
stead, "Are you alone and do you want a
helping band, and would you like to be
one of us?" It will not be'a sin in this
club for the girls to have a dance, ana if
they choose to get up private theatricals
or a little concert, or a burlesque exhibi
tion of paintings, there will be encourage
ment for them, and when the really jolly
nights are on Land it is just possible, in
fact 1 think I may say tliat it is absolutely
probable, that if some girl blushes and
wishes she could ask Tom Brown, she will
be told to invite him, and indeed each girl j
can ask the Tom, Dick or Harry who may j
be friend or sweetheart.
You see, this club is to be run by girl- '

women, and by a girl-woman I mean one
who has every desire of a woman â her
bravery (else she wouldn't be at work or
trying to learn how to work) and the years
of a Â£irl, which live her a right to enjoy
herself. Somebody says to me as lam
talking, "Bab, you are too enthusiastic."
No, lam not; not a bit. The world is full
of pessimists who make bitter (by their
words) even the sweet odor of violets ; who
see nothing good either in heaven or earth,
forgetting that on earth there are women.
If when every woman child were born its
future from its cradle to its
were arranged for no one would be
happier than I. I do not believe
lin women having to earn money, ex
| cept by earning it as grateful daughters,
| loving wives and devoted mothers. But,
j alas! there are so many women. And up
! on the frail shoulders "of so many women
i falls the support of so many others. If
! there is a woman worker in the family be
j sure that she is carins for somebody, and
; men should blush with shame when they
I allow women to earn money for them;
that is, of course unless they are invalids.
But right here, where there are thousands
of women working, there are women sup
l porting lazy, shiftless menâ brothers, sons
or husbandsâ and doing it willingly ; los
ing their beauty, losing their attractive
ness, losing all externally that is theirs
by right of their womanhood, because
they have not only to work, but to work
too hard.
You know lam telling the truth. You
need only to look in your own small town,
if you live in one, to "find the shiftless man
who is supported by a woman. If there
is one in the small town, how many are
there in the great big cities? There are
women who are supporting drunkards.
Do you know what that means? To give
a man his daily bread, his clothes and the
roof that covers him, and in addition,
when you are alone to find yourself utter
ing a silent prayer that "he may come
home sober. To have him appear "drunk,
beastly drunk; to put cold cloths on his
head, to try and induce him to take some
j medicine, to work and watch until he eoes
j to sleep; perhaps to have a bruise on your
forehead where he struck you, and which
you excuse because he did not know what
he was doing. After a sleepless night to
find yourseif at your work, and to have
the editor or the picture-buyer or the mer
chant wonder why "you don't throw more
life into your work this morning." These
women are the martyrs of the nineteenth
century.
It is "sadly true. But there are pleasant
things to think about even among tne
workers. There is going to be many a
pleasant evening for the lonely girl, and
she is looking forward to it now with joy,
for she is sure that the good time will
come, since it is being furthered by the
large-hearted woman who made it pns-
I sible for her who needed it to learn to work
well. That is the secret of it â to do it
well. And that is what in her 'own wo
manly way Mr 3. Dunlap Hopkins has
done. lam not a great one for flaunting
the star-spangled banner; some of the
stars are not much credit to us, but the
oue which reflects the State in which Mrs.
Dnnlap Hopkins was born is a credit to it
self and to all the world. Which one?
Well, one of those great big Western ones,
bis enough to give birth to generous
women and appreciative men. I never
look at her, 1 never see those clear,
earnest dark eyes of hers that I do not
think:
A lady with a lamp shall stand
In the creat history of the land,
A noble type of good,
Heroic womanhood.

YANKEE BOY BECAME
A FINANCIAL LORD
-IN SIBERIA
ENOCH EMORY, the merchant
prince of the great Amur region
of Siberia, is a Jiving example of
what may be achieved by an
American boy gifted with pluck,
grit, energy and enterprise.
The story of his rise from a humble
boyhood in a Massachusetts country vil
lage to a position of vast and commanding
influence in the Czar's Asiatic dominions
may be an incentive to some of our youth
to-day to "be up,and stirring" and on the
the sharp lookout for the opportunities
that are constantly presenting themselves
and then flitting away forever. As the
ancient bard has it,
Time wears all his locks before,
And behind his scalp is bare.
Arthur A. Smith and Thomas Freeman
of the shipping and commission house of
Freeman, Smith <fc Co. of San Francisco
each had a hand in shaping the destiny of t
young Emory, although they did not begin
to foresee such results as the years have
brought wiih reference to the Deaniless
boy they started out on the path to fame
and fortune.
Somebody may observe that Emory's
success was due to accident in the begin
ning; but it must be remembered that it is
not everybody who possesses the foresight
t< i take advantage of the openings made by
accident.
Both freeman and Smith were Bos
tonians before they launched in business
or. the snores of the Pacific Shortly after
the Civil War they established themselves
ai the seaport of Nikoleevsk. at the mouth
of the Amur River in Siberia, shipping
goods thither from America, and engag
: _â  in a general supply trade with the set
ts along the river above-mentioned
ta tributaries. The Amur province,
while it is the smallest in Siberia, yet em
braces a territory of 173,559 square" miles,
aixl ten years ago it was credited with a
ation of only 40,000. It has rich
prairie lands, where even watermelons
prow in ihe short, hotsummer; hilly tracts
c< vered with forests, and mountains rich
in gold and other precious metals. That
nee would easily support a popula
tion of many millions. The firm of Free
man (V Smith landed supplies at Nikola
evsk and from there shipped goods up the
long river by boat in summer and by sled
in winter when the stream became atrack :
of ice. They prospered even beyond their i
anticipations, but the Siberian climate and j
the remoteness from the Enclish-speaking
world were things they didn't propose !
â 'â > endure.
In the year 1886 both members of the
f.rm retained to this country on a visit, ,
"combining business with pleasure/ as
the common saying goes. While in Boston
they met a mutual old friend in the person
of a Mr. Emory. The latter was-accom
panied by his son, Erjoch, a lad of 16
years. The Emorys resided in a little
town on Cape Cod. The tale of wealth in a
comparative wilderness on. the other side
of the world was listened to with avidity
by the youth, and he had no sooner
reached home than he begsjed permission
of his parents to go along with Messrs.
Freeman and Smith to Siberia. In a way
akin to jest the parents consented, trust
ing, doubtless, that Enoch's sudden fancy
would die out in a few days and be for
gotten. The boy was determined, how
ever, and he wrote to Mr. Freeman on the
Bubject, telling him of the parental will
ingness, making known his strong desire
to go to Siberia and asking for a position
in the firm's establishment at Nikola
cv?k.
Freeman consulted his partner, and then j
vrrote immediately to Enoch that a posi- j

tion would be made for him, and that he
â would be expected" to be in readiness to
eail for his destination on a certain date
â¢within a month. Days went by, and r.o
answer came from Enoch.
"Change of mind," the merchants
thought. The firm's vessel completed her
cargo and was within a day of setting sail
from Boston.
Smith was on the wharf, giving some
final directions to the skipper, when sud
denly his coat was pulled by a little fellow
carrying a small bundle of thines tied in
a handkerchief. It was Enoch Emory.
"What?" cried Smith, laughingly. "Are
you all ready. for sea?" An affirmative
response followed. "And are those all the
tilings you have brought with you?"
queried tlie merchant.
"Well," explained Enoch, "I hadn t
time to get very much together. Had I
delayed just a few minutes longer I should
have missed the train, and then I couldn't
caich the ship."
"Didn't Mr. Freeman write to you sev
eral weeks ago, though?" urged .Mr.
fc-mith.
Then Enoch unfolded a tale of maternal
interest and devotion, and of words that
were spoken too soon for the realization of
a mother's fond design.
"The letter came," said Enoch, "but
Tiiotner saw it first and suspecting what
was in it, she read the contents and hid it
away. The letter was kept a secret until
ehe thought the time had passed to make
it of any use to me, and only this very
morning did she hand it to me. Mother
tnought it best I shouldn't go, but I told
LÂ»-r 1 was resolved, and so I snatched up
these few traps, and bidding Ihe folks good
by, ran for the train."
"Do you know how long it takes to go to
Biberia? " asked Smith.
"No, sir."
"Seventy-five days. That handkerchief
full of duds will hardly do. And then it [
gets mighty cold theresometimes."
Enoch had not given these matters any j
thought, and Mr. Smitii took him up- j
town, bought a whole outfit, put the boy i
aboard shin, and told him they would next j
meet at Nikolaevsk.
"We gave the youngster a clerkship at !
the seaport," said Mr. Smith a few days
ago. "Freeman and I were not much in
love with Siberia and in 1870 we decided to j
come to San Francisco and do business j
with the Asiatic country through a trusted i
agent. Enoch Emory proved to be. just j
the kind of man we wanted and we left j
him in charge at Nikolaevsk. In 1872 !
Enoch made a proposition to us and we i
accepted it. By its terms we' transferred i
our Siberian interests to the boy we j
shipped from Boston as a clerk only four j
years previous.
"Twenty-four years have passed and to
day the firm of Freeman, Smith & Co. is
the San. Francisco agency of Enoch Emory j
of Moscow, Knssia.
To-day Enoch Emory is one of the rinan
cial princes of the empire of the Czar. He
draws his supplies from all parts of Europe
and America, and his business extends in j
all directions through not only the Amur 'â¢
region, but throughout the 3,000,000 and |
more of square miles of Eastern Siberia, j
He has trading posts at intervals for over !
2000 miles along the Amur and its tributa
ries and a veritable army of acents.
Seldom it is that some vessel of Emory's
is not loading or unloading at his long !
wharf at Nikolaevsk on the Gulf of Amur.
The Emory headquarters at this port are
shown in an illustration on this page. He
supplies whole settlements witli anything
desired from a pin to a steam locomotive.
During the past twenty years he has made

as many as nineteen trips from Moscow to
the distant coast of the Okhotsk Sea.
In the Amur country, where a number
of -Cossack villages have been located, a
considerable degree of civilization prevails.
This may be judged in a measure by the
fact that in a recent shipment of goods
consigned to Emory's Siberian agency
were several scores of California saddles
and a couple of hundred bicycles. -Mr.
Emory furnishes supplies wholesale to the
Russian Government, and â  his in-
I terests include a big shsye in the mam
moth enterprise of the Siberian railway,
which when completed will cover a
distance of 7000 miles. And as Siberia
develops in population and wealth the
fortune of Enoch Emory will increase in
magnitude, and Barney Barnato's present
lordly .pile may some day look small
alongside the golden possessions of the
Yankee boy who started out to conquer
a Siberian wilderness with the bacKing of
a resolute will and a po-ahead spirit, and
with just baggage enough to fill a hand
kerchief.
NEW STOEIES OP GEANT.
His Lesson to a Luxurious Quarter
master on a Kainy Night.
In the summer of I^4. I passed two days
at the headquarters of General Grant at
City Point, Va., and thus had an oppor
tunity to observe the way of life of this
most democratic of tnc Union command
ers. He mesied with his staff and at his
table sat familiarly every member of his
military househould. The expenses of the
mess, I was told, were divided among the
various members, not in equal propor
tions, but according to the rank of the
various members and in a manner satis
factory to all. There was no show of pa
rade in either furniture or equipage. Every
thing seemed to be for use and arranged i
to economize both space and attention. \
The crockery was scanty and of the plain
est description, and the fare, though abun
dant in quantity, was of a quality that
might be found on the table of any well
to-do workingman in the North. A chop,
with a cup of coffee, served for breakfast, j
a bit of roast beef, with potatoes and hard !
tack, Hanked by a dish of pork and greens, j
sufiicexl for the Â« o'clock dinner, which had '
neither pastry nor dessert. A cup of tea
and a slice Of bread and butter completed
the fare for the day. The beds were merely
camp cot?, some of them without mat
tresses, and all the visible toilet apparatus
were a few tin wash-basins, a scanty sup
ply of towels, a bit of looking-glass" and a
horn comb.
Every one has read the inventory of the >
general's; bag gage when he made the Vicks- \
burg campaignâ "a briarwood telescope j
and a tooth brush." When I met him at j
City Point he had not greatly enlarged his i
personal possessions. Except the three
stars upon his shoulders, there was abso
lutely nothing about him to indicate his I
exalted rank. His clothes were thread
bare, and, despite the constant brushing
of his servant, they would present an un- j
tidy look, due, no doubt, to his habit â¢
of going 'everywhere and seeing every- I
thing for himself. The general under- !
stood the kinship of cleanliness and
godliness, but there was utter absence of
"fuss and feathers" about him and his en
tire surroundings. Judging of him by !
common report, I had expected to rind ]
him decidedly reticent, but, on the con
trary, I observed that in familiar inter
course he was somewhat loquacious, fond
of a good story, and often giving vent to a

prim humor that was decidedly en joya ble.
Illustrative of this phase of his character,
some members of his staff repeated to me
several amusing anecdotes, two of which â
as I have never ser-n them in print â it may
not be amiss to give to the public.
I was told that when the general's head
quarters were at Culpepper an officer at
tached to the quartermaster's department,
who was stationed some half-dozen miles
away, desired to consult him on some busi
ness that he deemed of importance. The
day was exceedingly rainy and the roads
Were knee deep in mud, and to avoid un
due exposure to the weather the officerâ
who was one of the old regime, with a full
appreciation of the dignity of his rank â
ordered up a close carriage and, as it was
likely that night would come on before he
could return, had the lamps trimmed and
hung out on either side of the driver's seat.
Then, with an escort of twelve cavalrymen,
he set out for headquarters, happy in the
thousht that he was proof against the
fast-descending rain.
Not far from Culpepper he met an ordi
nary-looking horseman, attended by only
a single orderly, and was aooutto pass him
without notice, when he suddenly-recog
nized him to be the lieutenant-generaj,
who, in spite of the rain, was making his
usual round of the army, attended by his
usual slender escort. To descend from his
carriage and salute his chief was but the
work of a moment; but the general, irri
tated by the style and pretension of the
officer, was in no hurry to see him regain
the shelter of his carriage. "Walk along
with me a little," said the general. "I
wanttotalk with you." With polished
boots and unexceptionable kids Mr. Quar
termaster did as he was bidden, and with
a touch of grimness the general led hini
through the muddiest part of the road and
did not release him until he was wet tot ho
skinâ a 1 ; wet as was the general himself.
Then he dismissed him with a few curt
remarks, which were not overheard by the
orderly. Their purport, however, was con -
jectured by the general's staff, for they ob
served that the ofiicor never again ap
peared at headquarters in a close carriage.

grain broker, testified to having seen Pot
ter for the last timfl at noon the Friday
preceding his deatfc. The deceased was
then in a cheerful frame of mind. The
witness learned that Potter left for the
Cliff House.
8. Christiansen, barkeeper at the Cliff
House, testified to serving Dr. Hicks and
Potter with drinks. He had heard them
discussing which car they would take, and
that was the last he saw of the men. The
inquiry was continued until Wednesday,
when it is expected that Dr. Hicks of
Tacoma will be present and testify.
Lord Rosebery is reported to have said
that it took him fifteen hours a day to get
through his work as Foreign Secretary.

A FAMOUS KENTUCKY DUEL.
Its Memory Revived by the Recent
Death of Colonel William Duke.
The sudden death of Colonel William
Duke, at his nome in Danville, Ky., brings
to mind the tragic details of his historic
duel with the noted Confederate General,
Roger Hanson, of the famous "Orphan
Brigade," over the beautiful Caroline
Hickman, Hanson's cousin, and afterward
Duke's wife.
The duel took place in 184S, shortly after
Duke had returned from the Mexican war,
having enlisted with Humphrey Marshall
when 18 years of age. Hanson, then a
brilliant, dashing young fellow, was in
love with his cousin, Miss Hickman, and
when he heard that she was the promised
wife of DuKe he had an interview with her
in which he used language which was in
sulting to Duke.
Duke heard or llie denunciation, and j
feeling his honor assailed promptly chal
lenged Hanson. Duke was within a few
weeks of 21 years of age and Hanson was
two years older. The Dearer of the chal
lenge was James Jackson, whose wife was
Duke's cousin. Hanson not only accepted
the challenge, but at the same time re
peated his denunciation of Duke. Lafay
fayette Dunlap, then representing Garrard
County in the Legislature, was chosen by
Hanson as his second.
The seconds chose sunrise, January 17,
as the time, a narrow strip of land on the
Indiana shore opposite the mouth of the
Kentucky River as the place, and dueling
pistols at ten paces as the weapons. Han
son and Dunlap speedily repaired to Frank
fort, whore Hanson, already an expert, oc
cupied himself in daily pistol practice.
Duke went to his father's home, in Scott
County, and there, in the presence of his
kinsmen, he fired 100 sliots to the satisfac
tion of all. He had never used a dueling
pistol, but his quickly acquired skill gave
him confidence.
The Duke and Hanson parties left Frank-
fort on the same steamer the day before
the duel. Mutual friends, fearing that
Duke was recklessly endangering his life,
endeavored to conciliate him, but their
overtures were spurned. The boat
steamed away, leaving a large congrega
tion of legislators, State oilicials and cit
izens on shore. Where the encounter was
to take place only the principals, seconds
and surgeons knew. Reaching the town
of Carrollton, at the mouth of the Ken
tucky, the two parties went ashore to
await the coming of the following day.
Early Thursday morning Duke arose,
wrote a brief note to Caroline Hickman,
and in a short time word came that the
Hanson party was ready for the journey.
Just at daylight they rowed across the
Ohio, and at sunrise were ready for the
word. The ground was stepped off and
the pistols handed to the principals. Two
prominent gentlemen in* the party, in a
spirit of mutual friendship, approached
Hanson and asked him to apologize. He
refused, and Dunlap cave the word to pre
pare and fire.
The pistols cracked simultaneously,
Hanson firine too low, Duke too high.
There was an interval of ten minutes.
Jackson won the second toss. At the sec
ond tiring Hanson's ball went near Duke's
head and perceptibly startled him, but
Duke's went wide of the mark. There was
another interval of live minutes, and at
the next shot blood was shed. Hanson's
clothing was pierced under the left arm
and Duke's right hand was spurting blood.
This time tile principals did not change
their positions while the pistols were be
ing reloaded. Dunlap asked :
"Gentlemen, are you satisfied?"
"No," came promptly from both.
Richard Hanson,, a brother of Roger,
here left the field, and stood near the river
bank until the duel was declared at an
end. The fourth round Dunlap won the
word and gave it more rapidly than be
fore. Both tired at once. Duke stood un
moved and untouched. Hanson was seen
to throw his pistol into the air, leap for
ward and fall headlong to the earth. The
larÂ»e ball had crashed through the right
thigh bone, making a horrible wound, and
breaking also the left thigh.
The tumult of a moment before subsided,
and, horrified at the spectacle, friends and
foes stood dazed in significant silence.
Duke and his friends recrossed the river,
leaving Hanson horribly mangled and in
great agony, in care of the surgeon.
Hanson was taken to Major Butler's house
and there remained in care of Dr. Blanton
until moved to Lexinirtorr. He was a
member of the Kentucky Legislature at
the time. Duke, accompanied by a few
friends, went to Louisville, and then to his
home. Eleven days later he married the
singularly beautiful Caroline Hickman,
who became the mother of five handsome
daughters and two sons.
The pistols used by Hanson in this his
toric duel belonged to Andrew Jackson,
and were used by him in several encoun
ters. Duke's were Henry Clay's, and were
presented to him by a French nobleman.
It was the same pistol with which Clay had
fought John Randolph of Roanoke. Hum
phrey Marshall and James Jackson had.
also used the weapons. The pistols were
similar, very long, single-barreled and car
ried very large balls.
Hanson recovered, but was lamed for
life, the right leg being somewhat shorter
than its fellow and slightly deformed.
Lexington o'eing the horrve of "Hanson and
Duke living near, they were frequently in
company, but their former friendly rela
tions were not then restored. Duke was
engaged in farming in Scott County, and
Hanson entered actively into the practice
of law and soon reached distinction, be
coming Commonwealth's Attorney.
When the Civil War began Hanson and
DuKe espoused the Southern cause, Duke
going with Morgan and Hanson on the
staff of John C. Bredcinridge. At Knox
vill.e Hanson was created a brigadier-gen
eral, and gave promise of a record on the
field as brilliant as he had made in the
forum. When he was promoted a sub
scription was started io present him with a
horse, and Duke contributed to the fund.
Hanson gracefully recognized this magna
nimity, and cordial relations were once
more resumed. Hanson fell in the famous
disastrous charge, led by Breckrnridge, at
Stone River.
For many years after the war Duke
lived upon a fine 500-acre blue-grass farm
near Danville, and during the past few
years had resided in this city. When his
first wife died he met and married Miss
Klisi Duerson, a beautiful and gifted
woman of Louisville, and she preceded
him to the grave severul years, leaving no
children. Colonel Duke always spoke
kindly of General Hanson, and never
talked of the duel except with great re
luctance. â St. Louis Globe-Democrat.

THE WINGLESS ANGEL.
Above the dome of our City Hall there
is to stand the tigure of an angel without
wings. This is not the first time that men
have chosen such a symbol to represent
what they fondly hoped to have as the
tutelary deity. or animating spirit of their
civic life. Ages ago the old Athenians
raised above the gateway of the Acropolis
a wingless victory. They made her wing
less that Bhe might never fly from Aihcns,
that where they had perched her there
would she stay and victory be with the
Violet City forever.
The age of symbolism is over. We have
passed beyond that stape of intellectual
development when symbols, by exciting
the imagination, could powerfully affect
the conduct or even the faith of men.
Few people in our country, or, indeed, in
our time, see anything in art beyond the
art itself. That class of men of whom it
w&s written, "A primrose on the river's
brim a yellow primrose was to him, and it
was nothing more," is the class to which
most of v? belong. We may not expect,
therefore, that there will bs any wide ac
ceptance in this City of the symbolism of
the wingless angel. In fact, if such sym
bolism should occur to any it would most
likely give rise to a jest, a sarcasm or a
sneer rather than to any thought of beauty
or of grace.
There ib a symbolism in our wingless
angel, however, and although a scoftinn
world may ignore it or mock at it, to all
those who delight in fair things it will
come ajrain and again with a quiet insist
ence. Truly we must regard the symbol
ism of it if we expect at all to regard it
with pride. It is no immortal work, like
the wingless victory of Athens. Such shat
tered fragments of it as remain after a
thousand years will not be gathered up
and treasured as a thing of beauty and a
joy forever. What it symbolizes is what
we must gee in it if it iÂ« to be of any value
to us, or of any significance beyond that
of capping the climax of a long job.
We need not seek far for the symbolic
meaning of our angel of the City Hall.
The coincidence of the erection of this
figure at a time when there is arising
in the City a new spirit of harmony, a new
impulse impelling the people to work to
gether for good things, a new sense of civic
patriotism, a new consciousness of the
great destiny that awaits San Francisco
and a new feeling of the responsibility
which that destiny imposes on the indi
vidual citizen, makes the statue to some
extent the natural emblem of the spirit
that now animates the people. Our wing
less angel, that having no power of flight
is to stay with us forever, is therefore
neither more nor less than a symbol of
civic patriotism, and it rightly has its
place above the stately edifice where the
life of the city has its center and its power.
It is an assured truth that if we can main
tain in the City that spirit which for nearly
a year now has been growing more and
more dominant among the people, we will
be able to achieve many things which at
present seem hardly more than far-off
possibilities. It was once written of Jerusa
lem that her young men dreamed dreams
of splendor and her old men saw visions of
glory. The same might well be written of
our own golaen City by the Golden Gate
to the world's great orient ocean. The
splendors of which the youth of this gene
ration dream, before they are old may be
realized glories. All that is needed to
achieve it is that the spirit of a true patri
otism be kept steadfast in the homes that
are the altars of the City and in the halls
where its laws are ordained. That it
should remain thus steadfast must be the
desire of all good men and it is this de
sire that endows with a lofty symbolism
the wingless angel that guards the City
Hall.
THE LABOE COUNCIL.
Representatives of the various trades
unions of San Francisco have organized a
council, which is to remain in session in
definitely, for the purpose of rousing a re
newed interest in the cause of labor and
to come to a better general understanding
among themselves of the needs and hopes
of all.
It not infrequently is the case that an
earnest and intelligent movement by the
working classes to improve their condi
tion is diverted from its high purpose by
agitators employed either by unscrupulous
politicians or alarmed capitalists to bring
the movement into disrepute. In all the
world there is but one escape from the
multiple perils which wait upon the or
ganized efforts of labor. That is educa
tion. Just as it is impossible for an illiter
ate man to acquire without study and a
trained observation an adequate under
standing of the principles which govern
society, so it is all the easier for educated
men to take advantage of the ignorance of
others.
Fortunately there is little or no danger
from any of these evils in the associations
of American workingmen. Our citizens
of all degrees have not only the mental
training given in the public schools, but
all of them of mature age have received
that broader education which comes from
political freedom and incessant activity in
the practical conduct of parties. In the
labor convention which has just assem
bled in this City there were men as well
fitted to administer municipal affairs as
any that could be found, and in the gen
eral tone of the resolutions submitted for
discussion there is shown a directness of
purpose in attacking existing evils that
gives promise of a genuine sagacity in
dealing with them.
Almost all improvements in social con
ditions have derived their first impulses
from two classes of men; those of leisure
and learning who have had the time and
the ability to study and to understand the
causes of prevailing evils, and those en
gaged in the hard struggle for existence
who have been taught the full force of
these evils by a bitter experience. When
the philosophy of the thinker and the
earnestness of the workingman combine,
reform movements begin, and it then de
pends upon the common-sense and busi
ness sagacity of the great middle class to
taKe them up and direct them safely to the
desired end.
In a land of free Bpeech and among a
people of- vigorous intellectual activity
thore will always be agitators, and not a
few of them will be cranks. AVorkingmen,
however, are no more in danger of being
led away by these than any other class of
citizens. The new organization in this
City, therefore, is only another of those
numerous associations whose various
energies directed to diverse objects
tend to mutually assist in promot
ing the general welfare. There is
certainly a promise that much good will
be accomplished in this instance. Some
of the evila complained of, such as viola
tions of the eight-hour law and the un
sanitary conditions amid which many
workingmen have to work, ought to be
remedied at once. At any rate the work
has beeun well and there is every reason
to believe it will continue so to the end.
AN UNNECESSARY EVIL.
The recent shaking up which the tight
ing forces of the Nation have received has
developed the unpleasant fact that the
engineers of the navy are not on an equal
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. FEBRUARY 16, 1896.
footing with the line, and that as a result
our navy has become deplorably weak in
that respect. It is clearly understood that
this discrimination is a heritage of the
days when fighting heroes were made on
the decks of vessels propelled by sail and
when the ingenious mechanic who made
his advent with the appearance of steam
was taken from the ran Us. of civilians and
therefore regarded by the officers On deck
as a person of no consequence.
Tins tradition has seriously impaired
the usefulness of the Naval Academy at
Annapolis. The lad who applies for admis
sion to that institution is furnished with
no incentive to study that wonderful
science which after all places the life of
the ship and of all its men in the hands of
one who must be the coolest and mo3t
patient of all. This .is solely because the
engineer, instead of being a i>ersonage
who wears a sword, strides the deck in fine
plumage and gives thundering orders to
hundreds of mariners, remains unseen and
unknown in the hot bowels of the ship
without adequate authority or rank.
The importance of his services, the edu
cation and native ability required, the
arduous duties which ho has to perform
and the tremendous responsibility which
rests upon him have not been fully recog
nized. In the stress of battle it is he
alone who is depended on to handle the
vast intricate machine with precision, in
telligence and coolness.; directing it in
stantly whithersoever the commander
orders, keeping alive the maze of appli
ances by which the turrets are moved, and
not for a moment removing his tirm linger
from the puJse of the groaning, struggling
monster. It is he alone who must exercise
the sharpest alertness of which the mind
is capable, and be able instantly to devise
means for repairing any damage that may
be received.
The trouble with his position is that
while it lacks nothing of the heroic, no
element of the picturesque pervades it.
He does not have the chance of glory by
falling with a bullet through his body, but
his perils are very great for all that and he
is denied the privilege of lighting in the
open air. Not being sustained by the ex
citement of physical combat, he must
have a high order of character to light
none the less effectively in darkness and
heat and with an invisible foe.
Until the present, order of things is
changed it is useless to expect young men
to covet the unfashionable berth. Ana
polis will have failed of half its purpose if it
is unable to supply engineers to the fighting
ships of the Nation, and the evil is one so
simply remedied that its continued exist
ence will be a constant reproach to the
country. â¢
ELEMENTS OF GREATNESS.
The story of the private life led by Fade
rewski, the wonderful Pole who is delight
ing our people with his piano-playing, is
so identical in its broader aspects with that
led by all others who have achieved dis
tinction in the world as to have a special
value in furnishing cumulative evidence of
tne elements of greatness. That is to sa}\
this marvelous .wizard of the keyboard
lives solely for his art, and in the pursuit
of that course pschews all the graces, pleas
ures, blandishments and dissipations of
life; all that might raise him above, drag j
him beneath or in any way divert him
from the exceedingly restricted purpose of i
his life; pays the strictest regard to the |
conservation of his vital forces and devotes ]
his days to unceasing labor.
Whatever native talents he may have had
for his art, their development to the pres
ent point of excellence would have been
impossible in the absence of the regime
which he has forced upon himself. But it
is clear that he could not have followed
such a course had it not be.en in him to do
so. This may not be an encouraging re
flection to those who are aware of the pos
session of line talent but who do not fuljy
develop it by work, but that does not im
pair the truth of the ancient maxim that
labor is the better part of genius.
It may happen that a deep aflliction cre
ates a spirit of asceticicm and a lusHfor
work that lift talent to the plane of genius.
This is saia to have been the case with
Paderewski. But that makes no differ
ence with the fact that rigid asceticism and
unceasing work make the round of his
seemin-dy dreary and friendless private
| life and accor.nt largely for his eminence.
| Greatness and personal isolation have
walked liana in hand through all history
where isolation was employed in labor.
I. The wonderful part of the greatness
which isolation and labor produce is that
it has the strength to resist the tempta
tions which press persistently upon the
periphery of life at every point. Take
Paclerewski as an example. Heisayoung
man, cood-looking, strong and healthy.
Tho very nature of his profession makes
him the object of insistent temptations of
the most alluring kind. No man measur
ably less great than he could withstand
them for a moment; but Paderewski has
that wisdom of genius which informs him
that should he yield to ever so small an
extent the splendid structure which he has
built from the groveling earth to the skies
would come down in ruins.
He is yet young and his most trying
years are yet to come ; the genius who can
pass unscathed through the decade follow
ing his fortieth year is a genius indeed,
booth" and Irvine did, but McCuHough
died in a madhouse. It is when the high
and noble enthusiasm of youth begins to
fade that dissipation in middle life, fol
lowed by avarice in old age, begins to make
ready for a harvest of ruin.
A EEMABKABLE MAN.
Thomas Lake Harris, who a few years
ago vras the central figure of a series of
strange occurrences, had so completely
dropped out of sight that he might have
continued to live in obscure luxury in
New York to the end of his days had not
little Mary Harris committed suicide at
Fountain Grove the other day and started
a train of grave suspicions. But her piti
ful death drags forth the shadowy memory
of the odd philosopher of Sonoma County
and carries it far back to the tragic days
when Lady Oliphant denounced him to
the world for hiving stripped her gifted
son Laurence of his fortune.
Harris founded a community in Sonoma
County having the double feature of a
strict communism and a quest for unend
ing life on this earth. He announced the
discovery of a law whereby it was possi
ble for a human being to escape the pangs
and penalties of death. He assured the
writer hereof that he himself had mastered
the law and would never die. That is
something which it must be left with time
to prove. He gathered about him a num
ber of persons of considerable means, and
they all made over their property to him.
Among these was a Japanese prince, who
is now the manager of the property.
The farm under admirable care produced
famous fruits and wines and enjoyed great
prosperity. Harris lived in quiet content,
retreating now and then to the mountains,
thereto perfect himself in the mastery of
the law of everlasting life. He was a man
of superior intelligence, refined tastes and
wonderful power. It is interesting here to
say only that while he would not (because
he claimed he could not) impart the secret
of the law to any except those who had
undergone severe training for its reception i
he intimated that it was akin to the
Pythagorean idea of rhythm as the basis of
life. In other words, the Almiehty, the
source of all life, was the center of rhyth
mic pulsations which permeated all space
and gave life to organizea matter. If liv
ing creatures could bnng themselves into
perfect harmony with this pulsation they
would enjoy in the flesh the immortality
which belongs to the spirit.
It is interestine to reflect that the idea
of the Keeiy motor is based on a principle
allied to this, ti^ougb. shorn of its Har
risian sublimity. It was claimed by Harris
that he was able to communicate instantly
and at will with his adept followers in all
parts of the world. If he is still a believer
in his old doctrine he has given 10 the pub
lic no recent evidence of the fact.

MEMOIRS OF AN ARTIST.
CHARLES FRANCOIS GOUNOD'S
posthumous memoirs have been
published under the above title
by Rand, McNally & Co.
In this work the autobiography
of the great master has been brought down
to the time of the first production of his
opera, "Faust," supplemented and rounded
oft "by some charming and characteristic
letters from the master to his friends.
People have been accustomed to think
of Gojnod solely as a musician, but on
reading his memoirs one learns that this
is far too narrow a characterization. In
the first, place, the work indicates that as a
literary genius Gounod ranks at least be
6ide that other great musical writer, Ber
lioz; his incisive and luminous comments
on the literary work of many of his prede
cessors and contemporaries show him
CHARLES FRANCOIS GOUNOD.
to bare been in possession no less of the i
critical than the constructive faculty.
In one delightful discussion on matters
literary he terms words "docile and faith
ful servants of thought," and states their
duty to be to 'lead one to the summit
without rude shockâ mysterious guides,
who conceal both themselves and their
methods." \Vords served him thus. His
dominating penius attuned thought to
phrase as sweetly as it wove. melody and
harmony into musical expression.
In Gounod's young manhood, the auto
biography discloses, hiÂ« skill as a painter
was even more hiehly thought of than his
musical ability. In fact. Monsieur Ingres,
an authority on both arts and a directorof
the French Academy, besought Gounod to
discard the study of music and transfer
his energies to the development of color
and form. In the memoirs is a brilliant
dissertation on the art of Michael Angelo.
Raphael and others of a value to the world
far greater than a vait majority of accom
plished art works.
His comments on the compositions of
Mozart and Mendelssohn are of intense
interest, and his meeting and subsequent
friendship with the latter musician are
touched upon -with engaging freedom and
delicacy. One of the chief charms of the
autobiography lies, however, in the
glimpses Gounod gives one now and again
of his own sweet and noble soul.
The pictures of Rome, Florence, Naples
and Venice are word paintings of genius,
and tne whole work will rank as a classic.
Let us reproauce a few sentences from his
chanter with reference to that city "which
holds a great and glorious place in the his
tory of the arts, and to whose natural fea
tures her geographical situation has given
a character unique and exceptional in the
world.".
"Venice, joyous and sad, light and som
ber, rosy and livid, coquettish and sinis
ler, a constant contrast, a strange com
bination of the most opposite impressions,
a peari in a cesspool.
"Venice is an" encnantress; she is the
home of painters of radiance; she has in
vested art with sunlight. Contrary to
Rome, which waits for you, solicits you
slowly and conquers you invincibly stnd
forever, Venice seizes *yÂ° u by the senses
and fascinates you instantly. Rome
is serene and pacifying, Venice is exhilar
ating and disquieting; Dut the exhilaration
that she induces is mixed (at least it was
for me) with au indefinite melancholyâ a
feeling of captivity. * * * Those still
standing waters, washing in gloomy silence
the foundations of tne old palaces: that
dark, shadowy surface, from the depths
under which one thinks he hears the
uroans of some illustrious victim, make of
Venice a kind of capital of terror, she has
retained the impression of the Sinister.
And yet, under fine sunlighr, what magic
in the grand canal ! What reflections from
those lagoons when the wave transforms
itself into light! What power of brilliancy
in those old remains of ancient splendor,
which seem to contend among themselves
for the favors of the sky and to ask its aid
against tne abyss into which they are fall
ing day by day, tinally to disappear for
ever.
"Rome invites to meditation, Venice to
dissipation. Rome is the grand Latin an
cestor who. through the channel Of con
quest, will spread over the world tne
catholicity of language â prelude and
means to a catholicity vaster and of deeper
meaning. Venice is an oriental, not of
the Greek, but of the Byzantine type;
more suggestive of satraps than of pon
tiffs, and of Asiatic luxury than of the
solemnities of Athens or Rome. â¢ â¢ â¢
"Venice is a passion, not a lore. I was
fctduced upon entering, but when I .kit it ,
| was not with that sense- of tearing myself
I away as when bidding farewell to Rome,
] the strength of .which feeling shows the
force of the ties that bind.
"Naples is a smile, a reflection from
j Greece; her horizon drowned in purple
ana azure, her blue sky reflecting itself In
the azure waves; all, even to her ancient
name of Parthenope, plunge you again
inio that brilliant civilization to which
j nature pet such charming surroundings.
j Quite different is the smile of Venice, at
the same time caressing and perfidious; it
is like a feast above a dungeon-trap. It
was for this reason, undoubtedly, that, in
spite of her masterpieces and the magic
with which she is enveloped, I had at de-
I parture, r.nd without knowing why, a feel
ing of deliverance rather than of regret."
Gounod had the deepest veneration and
affection for his mother. To her, he says,
he owed everything he bus succeeded in
being, saying or doing, that was good.
CloÃing his reference to his mother in the
preface, he says:
' "May this tribute of a well-beloved son
i leave upon her tomba wreath more durable
i than our 'immortelles of a day,' and assure
; for her memory, after my death, a respect
that I could wish to make eternal."
The color and tone of the original has
been admirably maintained by the trans
'< iator, Miss Annette E. Crocker, and the
> book is clothed in an exceedingly original

geniously displays Gounod's initials â C.

A VALUABLE RBPRINT.
The Humboldt Publishing Company
has issued a reprint of the once famous
and now almost forgotten book, written
by Patrick Edward Dove, on "The Theory
of Human Progression." It is a work that
those who do not consider political econ
j omy "the dismal science" cannot well
afford to do without. It is prefaced by a
biographical sketch of the author, who
was a Scotch landed gentleman, written
by Alexander Harvey.
Patrick Edward Dove's book was, In a
sense, the forerunner of "Progress and
Poverty," and that Henry Gedrge owes
much to Dove there is the warrant of
George's own declaration for believing. In
"The Theory of Human Progression" the
natural method of land tenure, the Single
Tax, is clearly shown, ana its author de
clares that eventually political economy
will come to be a positive science, like
mathematics or chemistry, but this time
will not come until men have learned
that poverty is a result of ignorance of
the true and eternal laws of society
j rather than a blessing from heaven. But
I Dove's book, as its name implies, is much
more than a treatise on sociological laws.
His argument is based on the law of evolu
tion, but he beginshis evolutionary process
where Darwin and the others came to an
abrupt end. So long as the manifested
universe acts in pursuance of the evolu
tionary law, unguided by the element of
free will, there is no flaw in the natural
scientists. They weave a beautiful, logical
theory, which accounts rationally (on their
own basis) for all natural phenomena
below the human stratum. But when the
element of a human will comes in play
these philosophers either cease their
philosophies or cease to b<? philosophical.
Dove went beyond them all and showed
j that there was a logical connection between
I all the sciences, and that, therefore, "there
is a necessary order in which they must
evolve chronologically." Reasoning on
this basis, Dove pointed out the chrono
logical order of the sciences, c.nd so ac
curately, too (in so far ns experience has
proved), as to almost entitle liim to rank
as a prophet. Indeed, in a sense he was a
prophetâ in the sense that every true
philosopher is a prophet. [The book is for
sale in this City by the Popular bookstore.

JOHANNA AMBBOSIUS.
A very rema rkable figure has appeared
within the last yeas on the horizon of
German literature, says the "New York
Critic Johanna Ambrosius, a woman of
tne people, has published a small book of
verses, which in twelve months has gone
through as many editions, and at which
all who read must wonder. Karl Schrat

his introduction with great interest; for in

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1896.
simplicity. Here is a woman's existence
reduced to its simplest expression, deprived
of all grace of surroundings, of all that we
are apt to think indispensable to poetry
and the poetical atmosphere; a life in
I which culture was an unattainable luxury
and intellectual companionship "a
thing apparently unknown. All the "great
I human experiences have come to this
woman in rugged intensity, without ac
cessories, but they have struck sacred fire
from her ardent spirit. The conditions of
her life are almost incredible and far sur
pass Carlyle's Utopia of independent oim
plicity. Poverty as she has known it is a
rude taskmaster, and Johanna Ambrosius
has endured the prick of its goad since her
earliest childhood. In feeble nealth, she
has worked year in and year out, not at
her woman's work only, but on the thrash
ing floor end in the stable, to support her
family and keep the wolf from the door.
The outline of Johanna Ambrosius' life,
as Mr. Schrattenthal gives it, is more than
simple; perhaps as her friend he felt un
able to give us a fuller account of it. She
was born on August 3, 1354, at Lengu'ethen,
a small village in East Prussia. She was
the second child of a workmginan. As. a
litile girl she went to the village school,
but only until her eleventh year, when her
time was required for household work."
Their mother was an invalid, and Johanna
and.heT sister, while yet mere children,
were called on to do all the work for the
family â cooking, sweeping, washing and
scrubbing.
Their father, fortunately, was fond of
books, and did what lie could to make up
to the children for the advantages
they were obliged to forego. As a
great treat he allowed them to take
the Gartenlaube, a weekly illustrated mag
azine, and they were glad enough to de
prive themselves of any other pleasure for
the sake of this literary luxury. For many
years its pages seem to have been their
only intellectual pasturage, and Johanna
describes the unfailing delight of poring
over them after the hard day's work was
done. As a young girl the unfortunate
poet went into service, but seems to have
been very unhappy, for she soon returned
to her home.
At 20 Johanna married a young peasant
by the name of Voigt. We are tuld noth
ing of her subsequent life beyond the fact
tiiat a son and a daughter were born to the
young couple and that the struggle for ex
is;ence was more strenuous than ever.
The joys and sorrows of motherhood seem
to wear a keener edge for her, sharpened
as they are by the ever-present sense of
poverty and want. Yet the note
of joy predominates when she thinks
and writes cf her children, and
such a poem as '"Mem Bub" seems to have
come from the heart of all happy mothers.
It is this quality of universality which is
?o admirable in her verses. There is noth
ing of the village poet abont her. One who
did not read the introduction to these
poems and the account of her Jife would
be at a loss to know where and when
to place the author, for even where
we can find trace of autobiography in
here a:id there a verse, it is always
the universally human side of the
experience that is presented to us. Her
poems have been compared to all that is
classic in German literature, yet Herr
Schraitenthal assures us that it is only
within the last year or two that the -works
of the German Olympians have been ac
cessible to her. She Jooks back regretfully

FOR PtAIN WOMKN ONLY.
This book, consists of some dozen dia
logues, reprinted from the Pall Mall Ga
zette, and is a transcript of discussions
held between "my aunt, and I" on sub
jects dear to the feminine heart. The
contents page forms a very fair index of
the character of the discussions: "On Mir
rors," "On Bonnets," "On Bead Trim
mines," "On Clothes in General," "On
' Looks," "On Tailor-made Women," etc.
The philosophy of these articles is dis
tinctly feminine, though recalling in some
respects Carlyle'a "Sartor Resartus"*in so
far as the latter work treats of the habili
ments affected by human beings. "My
aunt" contencis that "no woman under 40
years of age Las the moral right to look
irrevocably plain," and holds that "all
who submit basely to such a fate should
be punished for doing so." The medicine
prescribed by "my aunt" for women with a
tendency to plainness is largely composed
of "mirrors, pierglasses and looking
glasses."
"My aunt" proceeds in the course of her
argument to dissect ilio average woman,
commencing 'with her bonnet and ending
with her shoes. Speaking of hats, she
says: "A woman's headgear must be
simple in outline and simple in effect.
... And it must be personal;.; The
properly trained woman would- no . more
accept a bonnet she had neither devised,
suggested nor selected than she would
accept a husband because that was* the
style of man people were marrying this
spring." And again: ">io self-respecting
woman wears another woman's hat. She
might as well try to wear her head." â â¢-. â â '
"For Plain Women Only" can be recom
mended as pertinent to the times and use
ful for summer reading. The sketches
will serve to amuse the masculine portion
of the novel-reading public, from their re
freshing feminine cynicism. The useful
hints to women, too, will not be dig
regarded by those to whena they are ad T
dressed. &f.

on the one band, and of England with
Germany due to complications in South
Africa on the other, give a peculiar and
timely interest to the book. It was a
famous tract twenty-rive years ago. and
made a profound sensation in England
and America, both by reason of its bear
ing on current. European events and pol
itics and from its remarkable blending of
military knowledge and literary skill. It
appeared originally in Blackwood's Maga
zine for May, IS7I, and purported to be the
recollections of events disastrous to Eng
land in 1875, narrated fifty years after by
an eye-witness. That England heeded
this "plain warning," which may almost
be looked upon in the light of a prophecy,
is evidenced by the recent British naval
display. Whether or not its lesson will be
heeded elsewhere as well remains to be
seen. The dreadful results depicted in the
fanciful sketch of Germany's supposed in
vasion of England are claimed to have
much to do with waking up the English
people to needed reforms in their army
and navy. Certain it is the present

PLEA FOB CHKISXIAN UNITY.
"Some Poems and Prose That Would
Fain Exalt the Word of God, the Divinity
of Jesus and Present a Plea for- Christian
Unity," is a work by Rev. Silliman Blag
den, published by Alfred Mudge & Son,
Boston. .The book is a model of typo
graphical excellence, and its illustrations
are superb. The author's intentions are
doubtless worthy of laudation. The vol
ume is replete with Scriptural texts, which
serve to bear out the author's intentions.
The poetry in the volume is very bad, in a
literary sense. Rev. Mr. Blagtlen is evi
dently* sincere in his endeavors to unite
Christians under a common banner. â¢ The
task seems to be a hopeless one. The
author is a fair-minded and noble-spirited
Derson, it would appear, and his work is
free from bias and prejudice. He. seeks to
accord the praises due to missionaries
without reference to sect or creed.

Under the title of "Public Reading and

to-develop individuality in the student,and
is looked upon as a most commendable ef
fort in this direction. The hints and helps
that it contains will readily give the stu

volume entitled "The Jewish Scriptures:
The Story of Their Origin and History in
the Light of the Latest Criticisms," by
Amos K. Fiske, the author of "Beyond the
Bourne" and "Midnight Talks at the
Club." The work is ({escribed as a "popu
lar account of the books of ttie Old Testa
ment considered as history and as litera
ture." The standpoint of the writer is
radical and in accord with what has been
called the "higher criticism."

In its review of the books of 1895 the
Publishers' Weekly says that the year
just past has been the most productive the
American book trade has ever known. It
registered 5469 books, of which i?6S were
new editious. In 1894 the total output
was only 4484 books, showing an increase
of nearly 25 percent. The activities of
the English publishers for the same
period, as given in the London Publishers'
Circular, resulted in the publication of
0016 books â an increase of only thirty-one
over 1894. The statistics compiled by the
Bibliographic de la France, on the other
hand, indicate a decrease across the Chan
nel from 13,007 books in J894 to 12,927
books.

"Lounger" in the Critic says that in old
times the publisher made the author, or,
at least, he made the author think that he

convinced the publisher that he does â and
that is all that iÂ« necessary to his well

The men w.ho have seen Sir Walter Scott
must now be getting few, says the West
minster Gazette. John Usher of Stodrig,
who died the other day, himself an en
thusiast on Border ballads, was one of the
rapidly diminishing little company. He
used to tell witH no small pride that on
one occasion, when Sir Walter was a
visitor at Toftfield, his birthplace, he. had
sat upon the great novelist's knee and had
sung several songs, for whicn he waa re
warded by Sir Walter with the present of
a white pony.
Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett's new
novel, "A Lady of Quality," will bs a sur
prise to her readers, as it is an entirely
new vein for her. The full title is "A Lady
of Quality; being a most curious, hitherto
unknown history, as related by Mr, Isaac
Bickerstaff, but not presented to the world
of fashion through the pages of The Tat
tler." The time of the story is the reign
of Queen Anne, and it is written in the
language of the period. Its heroine is a
girl whose mother died in giving her birth,
and who has grown to young womanhood
under no softer influence than that of her
father, who "is a swaggering, sporting,
bard-.lrinking squire of those easy-going
days."
REPLIES TO JUDGE BELCHER.
A Juror Explains Why Mrs. Shattnok
Win Acquitted. '
John L. McLaughlin, a member of the
Shattuck jury, . is angry over the com
ments of Judge Belcher upon the jury's
action in acquitting Mrs. Shattuck. He is
the president of the Fairmount Improve
ment Club and a man of standing .in the
community.
In replyinc to Judge Belcher yesterday
he said:
"In the first.place, on the plea of insan
ity the defense proved the proper medicine
had been administered . to Mrs. Shattuck,
and if she was not suffering from the dis
ease stated the medicine might have killed
her. , Doctors for the prosecution admitted
that was the proper medicine for that dis
ease. Examination of physicians showed
that she had been . suffering from erysip
elas. That was some time before the mur
der was committed.
"In the next place Truly Shattuck wrote
for Harry Poole. She said, 'Come quick
if you love me because you may riot tind
mother alive when you arrive. I think
you. can afford to forgive her. Come
qui^k.'
"Her deposition in the Police Ceurt
stated that she met him at the door and
went with him to the mother's room up
stairs. Mrs. Shattuck said, 'Are you go
ing to marry my daughter?'
"Harry Poole said, 'We cannot obtain a
license to-day, because the City Hall is
closed. But to-morrow, Monday, we will,
before she goes away.'
"He insisted on t>2ing married next day
and then Truly went out to get some water.
While outside she heard the report of a
pistol and on returning found Harry Poole
lying on the floor dying. â¢
â  "The prosecution did not prove , that
Mrs. Shattuck murdered him, nor that she
was not insane. The. jury was at sea, for
there was no proof that Mrs. Shattuck did
commit the murder. *â ' .â

THE THEATRES
THE Tavary Company's taste in
'â¢novelties" this year seems to
have run to works that were writ
ten for big opera-houses and de
mand costly productions. It is
painful to dwell upon the way in which
thrse operas have been put on the stage.
Guileless rustics on one-night sland.s may
be willing to split their best gloves ap
plauding a mise en scene which admits
of a Nubian slave wearing golden locks, a
diamond ti3ra and a Louis XIV gown
of silver tinsel; but people whose memo
ries of "Aida" are sacred to good opera
houses want none of these things. On the
other hand people who know anything of
MME. TAVARY, THE NOTED PRIMA DONNA, AT THE BALDWIN.
the opera demand some pomp and pagean
try in the scene where- Ramedes returns '
home victorious, and the least critical are !
tempted to wonder how an Egyptian j
general ever conquered Nubia with
a couple, of dozen men dressed as '
a historical review of military cos- j
tumes from the times of the Greeks to the
period of medieval knighthood. The only !
thing that prevented the triumph scene in
"Aida' 1 from resembling the march of all '
rations In the "Excelsior" ballet was the j
absence of Tommy Atkins from the pro-
cession.
Even the tinselly old "Huguenots" de-
THOMAS KEENE, AT TBB CALIFORNIA,
] served better treatment. With a good bal
; let and a handsome mise en scene, there
i is still something imposing about Meyer
j beer's showy work, but bereft of its gorge
! ousness the "Huguenots" is like a banquet
hall when the flowers have faded and the
l lights grown dim.
Elenora Duse, the Italian actress, opens
i her engagement in New York to-morrow.
1 This is Duse's second visit to America, and
there seems every prospect that the Pacific
Coast will again be passed over in her tour.
j This invidious distinction has not proved
soothing to the Italian resident?, who are
naturally anxious to renew acquaintance
with their compatriot since' she has
I blossomed out into universal fame.
The sons of sunny Italy say
that it strikes them as lack of enterprise
not to secure a visit from the greatest
living tragedienne. For their part they
are willing to promise and vow liberal
support to the theater that will give them
iJuse. There is little doubt that the great
Elenora would make as furious a sensa
tion here a.? she did in the East. The Jirst
time an audience sees puse it gener
ally compares her with Bernhardt
and finds her methods passionless be
side those of the French woman; the
second visit to puse I as the effect of
making one hesitate between her ajid
IJernhiirdf; but the third time settles it.
No one has been known to resist seeing

the supremacy of her genius. The fin-de
siecle naturalness of her playing would be
a revelation to San Francisco playgoers.
r.ii.l ->\ in Theater.
The last week of the Tavary Company
begins to-morrow night, when "The
Huguenots" will be presented. This will
be followed on Tuesday night by the first
presentation of "Lohengrin" during the
present stay of the company. "Mignon"
is to be heard at the Wednesday matinee,
and the bill for the evening of that day is
"Lucia" and "Cavalleria Kusticana."
"Faust" will be "heard for the last time
on Thursday night and "Tannhauser"
on Friday. Thea Dorre in her impersona
tion of Carmen will be seen and heard
at the last Saturday matinee, which the
management has decided to give at popu
lar prices, as well as the Wednesday rnati-
nee of this week. The company will bid
adieu on Saturday night with a production
of "Trovatore" and "I Pagliacci."
â The attraction to follow the Tavary
Grand Opera Company at tlie Baldwin
Theater is Frederick Warde. His players
include in their ranks Charles D. Herman,
Charles Sutton, Beverly W. Turner, H. D.
Byers, Henry C. Barton, Ernest C. Warde,
<irant Forman, John C. liickey, J. Lan
ders Stevens, George Fuller ton, Fanny
liille-tte, Lucia Moore, Craig Garrick and
Isabella Waidron. Mr. Warde will pre
sent during his engagement "King Lear,"
" Yir_'inius," "Julius Ctesar," "The
Mountebank, "' "The Lion's Mouth" and
other plays.
California Theater.
Thomas Keene's second week at the Cal
ifornia Theater will open to-morrow night
with "Merchant of Venice," in which he
will be supported by Miss Timbermann as
Portia, Miss Beigarde as Nerissa, and by
the same company that has been seen at
the California during the past week. Mr.
Keene's view of the play differs from most
of the actors of the past, who have made
Shylock an exceedingly tragic and some
what caricatured picture of a grasping
money-lender. With Mr. Keene he is an
object of sympathy and not of execration.
Like his Louis XI and Richelieu, it is a
consistent character study.
On Tuesday night Mr. Keene will play
"Richard III," which will be repeated also
on Saturday night. "Richelieu" will be
the bill for "Wednesday, "Hamlet" for
Thursday, "Othello" for Friday, "Mer
chant of Venice" for Saturday afternoon
and "Louis XI" for the farewell perform
ance on Sunday night. .
"The Bicycle Girl," a farcical absurdity,
tieaded by jolly Nellie McHenry, comes to
the California Monday week. The skit is
by Louis Harrison, and shows the new
woman and the coming man on thÂ« bicy
cle fad. It abounds with music, dances
and repartee.
Columbia Theater.
Katie Putnam will appear at the Colum
bia Theater to-morrow night in ''The Old
Lime Kiln," which was written for her by
T. C. Dazey and is said to be a play well
adapted to her especial style of work.
In its general lines "The Old Lime Kiln"
resembles "In Old Kentucky," and it is
said to permit of the same wide range of
comedy and pathos that characterized
Katie Putnam's work in "The Old Curios
ity Shop/ 1 where the widely divergent
characters of the Marchioness and Little
IS' ell gave full play to her versatility. In
the present day comedy and pathos go
side by side.
The selection of the Yellowstone Na
tional Park as the locale of a portion of
the story gives opportunity for unique ef
fects and color designs. Yellowstone Falls
and the geysers, Old Faithful, are two sub
jects that have been "scenically treated.
The story of the Dlay springs from the
struggles of a good man, accused unjustly
of a heinous crime, to re-establish his in
nocence in the sight of the world.
Grover's Alcazar.
"Faust" will be presented at Grover's
Alcazar this week. Percy Hunting will
appear as Mephistoiiheles, a part with
which he has lonpr been identitied. and
Misx Mina (Jleason will play Marguerite.
On the 24ih inst. the Carleton Opsra
Company will begin a season at the Alca
zar.
The opening opera will be Sir Julius
Benedict s "Lily of Killarney." Sir Julius
Benedict will be remembered as the con
ductor of the famous Jenny Land concerts
in America. He was afterward knighted
by t^ueen Victoria, more particularly as a
reward meritorious for the beautiful music
of this opera. He was ttie lirst musician
who enjoyed the distinction of knight
hood.
Grand Opera-Uouse.
The attraction for this week at the Grand
is John A. Stevens' clever Southern story
"Wife for Wife," which has not been seen
in Han Francisco for a long time. It af
fords an excellent illustration of life in the
South before the war. All the typical
characters, from the tire-eating duelist to
the cunning mulatto, are there. The story
is full of movement and has plenty of com
edy to offset the seripus interest.
The production will be the occasion of
the lirst appearance of the new leading
lady of the* company, Misa Essie Tittel,
also the reappearance in the male leading
role of the popular'nctor, Darrell Vinton.
The new stage manager. Louis Imhaus, is
to direct the presentation.
Tivoli Opera-House.
The last performances of "The Gentle
Savage" will be given at the Tivoli Opera
house this week.
romantic German opera, "Der
Freischutz," will be the attraction for the
week following. This is a work whose mu
sic never cloys. Many of the operas of its
age nave crown old and hackneyed, but
the "Freischutz" remains a deliglit to mu
sic lovers. Its libretto tells a weird story
of peasant life, which is too well known to
need repetition.
Ida Valerga will reappear in the role of
Agatha and the role of Annie will be taken
by Miss Jvate Marchi, who will make her
first reappearance on the scene of her
former succesfT The role of Max, the
young hunter, has been intrusted to Mar
tin Pache, who has sung the part most
successfully throuehout Germany and
Austria; John J. Raffael will essay the
basso can tan te role of Caspar for the first
time, and the remaining roles -will be
Played, by W. H. West, Maroell Perron,
George Iliidge ana C. Napoleoni.
At the Orphettm.
Most of the star feature of the Orpheum
programme last week will be retained on
the billior the coming wek. They are the
remarkable head-balancing act of the
Pantzer Brothers, who astonished the spec
tators by their seemingly reckless, yet
skillfully executed, feats of head equili
brism; the sketch act of the Garrisons,
the songs and monologues of Carroll
Johnson, the comedy work and banjo solos
of Billy Carter and Stanton's "rooster"
act.
For the week entered upon the Wiltons
will bean important new feature. They
are acrobatic comedy bar artists and are
considered almost the greatest in their
line. One of the two .vas in San Francisco
about fourteen years ago, when the team
was known as Wilton and Morris.
Rachel Walker wil! give her farewell
performance at to-day's matinee, as sne is
billed to open at the Orpheum, Los Angeles,

FOR THE GOLD FIELDS.
A Trip to the Klines at Cook's Inlet to
Take I'lrno Early in
April.
Considerable interest is being manifested
in the newly discovered gold fields at
Cook's Inlet, Alaska, and a number of
mining men have betaken themselves
thither in search of the yellow metal,
which is said to abound in those parts. It
is eren said that every stream in the re
gion bears gold, while quartz mines near
by have the name of being exceedingly
rich.
Charles D. Ladd is one of many who
predict a great future for the newly opened
mines. He has organized a trip to the
gold fields, the party to leave on or about
the sth of April in tha barkentine Marion.
The fare will be only $.jO from this City to

its t>etition for a special election to decide
whether or not San Francisco shall own its
own water and light works.
The communication was sent to the
board some time ago, and the union has
been waiting patiently for an answer, but
in vain. Tne committee in charge of the
matter says:
Ban Francisco, Feb. 13, 1896.
To the Hon. Board $f Supervisor*. San Fran-
I Ciscoâ Gkntlkmen: On September 18, 1895, we
iiled with you a petition asking that a .special
election be colled, at which the question of
public ownership of water and light works
should be submitted to the voters of San
Francisco.
It whs referred by you to your Finance Com
mittee (Messrs. Taylor, Hobbsand Benjamin).
We have attended a regular meeting of your
Finance Committee in December, and ex
hibited the indorsements and signatures of
3000 citizens and nine organizations. We have
tiled with you a memorial showing that water
rates in San Francisco average $20 per year for
the Bame service furntsljed in other cities
(under public ownership; lor $11 03: $1163
per year is the average late of thirty-tive cities
in the United States which operate public
water works.
We call your attention to the fact that San
Francisco is tne only city of its size in the
United States wliich do-es not own public water
works. We reminded you that this question
has always received the required majority
when submitted to the voters of other cities.
We gave statistics and estimates from Colonel i
Mendell's report (when he was employed by
the City), showing that a sufficient water sup
ply could be obtained for less than $10,000,000.
We referred you to the, annual sworn state
ments of the Spring Valley Water Company,
which exhibited the startling facts that their
yearly operating expenses are less than
$400,000, while their yearly revenue is over
$1,600,000. Their sworn statement for 1895
reatlirms these figures.
â We have given you facts and figures, taken
from official sources, which clearly show that
the inhabitants ot San Francisco are subjected
to an enormous unnecessary and unjust tax by
a private corporation (ali done with your assist
ance). The action of the people everywhere
shows that they approve of public ownership
of these utilities, and we nave shown that
cheaper' rates are charged in the cities that
own their water supplies and that public op
eration of water works is more economical,
under all circumstances, to the public than
private ownership.
The force of these facts should induce every
conscientious and honest representative of the
people to immediately take steps to abolish
this form of taxation of their constituents by a
few private individuals.
Regarding light rates, we gave you statistics
proving that electric lights are furnished now
by cities, under publi; ownership; at less than
one-half former charges by private corpora
tions. More recent reports publish to the
world that while you are pnying $15 per
month for electric lights, Alameda, under
public ownership, secures the same light for
less than $7 per month, and Santa Cruz the
same light for less than $4 per month. In gas
rates a similar discrepancy can be shown.
Gentlemen, we very regretfully record the
indifference manifested by you to this popular
appeal. V.m have on the other hand been
quick even to protect a rich corporation from
the consequences of its illegal acts. When the j
Market-street Railway Company early last i
year bepan to run over and kill our fellow-citi
zens and children it developed that they were
violating ordinance 2072 by not providing
their cars with fenders es required by law.
Public indignation began to be manifested!
and steps were about to be taken by the Civic
Federation to bring the officers of that com
pany before the courts. You immediately re
pealed that ordinance, and have to this date
given license, without penalty, to the street
railway companies to main or kill without
protecting the public by the use of proper
fenders.
Were you asked to repeal the old law by the
people or by the streetcar magnates? It is pre
sumed that they requested the change when
threatened with prosecution and it is a very
sad circumstance that you have shown so
much alacrity to obey the wishes Of these re
puted corruptlonists and refuse to pay any at
tention to a request that you must know em
bodies the prayer of the masses. Tne only rea
son offered us by the members of your Finance
Committee (Messrs. Taylor, Hoods and Benja
min) for not recommending the granting of
our petition was that funds were not available
for holding the soecial election. This seems to
be only an excuse, because the annual appro
priations for election expenses for the current
year are $32,000 (Municipal Order No. 2905,
passed September 23, 1895). Tne regular ex
penses of the Election Commissioners and
Registrar's office are otherwise provided for by
the appropriation of $9600 in the name order.
We have furnished you, in our memorial, with
an estimate from the Registrar's office to the
eft'ect that the special election could be held at
an expense of less than $20,000.
We beg to inquire wny the #32,000 already
appropriated and in the City treasury is not
available? Or why some part of the appro
priation for "urgent necessity" (s36,ooo) could
not be used for the purpose of relieving our
City from one ore more of the "octopi" that
are strangling it to decay. Or why part of the
$185,000 which you appropriated for "water
and municipal purposes" could not be used
for some permanent good instead of for filling
the coffers of a few who have been given the
privilege of taxing this community.
We now request some formal action either,
lor or against the expressed desire of these
petitioners for the calling of a special election
at which the question of public ownership of
water and light works snail be submitted to
the voters.
We beg to remind you again that we have
dealt only with facts and ligures taken from
official reports. We hold up before you and our
fellow citizens these statistics, which exhibit
how grievously and unwarrantedly they are
taxed by you for the benefit of a few wealthy
monopolists. We also exhibit the difference of
treatment which you accord to a popular de
niand from that which you have given to
shield the officers of rich corporations.
Truth speaks .stronger than fiction, ana com
ment is unnecessary. We have some hope that
you will redeem your names from the odium
which the facts cast around you.
We urgently request your early action upon
our petition "for municipal water and light
We ha^e the honor to be yours respectfully,

The union will bring the matter before
other organizations that are working
toward the pubiic good unless the Super
visors take some action at an early date.
PEE ACHED ABOUT SOUSA'S BAND.
Minister Hobbs Drew Some Beliglout
Arguments From a Musical Text.
It is seldom, if ever, that an amusement
enterprise figures in a sermon, except as
the object of scathing
:riticism. Still rarer
3 the occasion when it
lappens that such i*
ised as a text by . a
eacher of holy precept-
Che clergy .ire so ac
justomed to calling the
itage and its environs
0 task and making the
veil-worn comparisons
>etween the theater and
the abiding place of
, 1(-lOT1 0â¢,,.^ tuÂ»v tne remaks of a "West
ern minister recently made from his pulpit
are of unusual interest. This tribute to
the stage was delivered in the town of Deca
ture, 111., and the clergyman was the Rev.
E. G.-Hobbs, the secretary of the Illinois
Conference and pastor of Grace Methodist
Church ai that place.
At a recent Sunday sermon the Rev. Mr.
Hobbs tooÂ£ "Sou3a's Band," well-known
to San Franciscans, and soon to be here
again, as the text of hi 3 discourse, and
among other things said:
"There is something. radically -wrong with
the man who does not care for music. '\\ho
is there,' said Carlyle, 'that, in logical words,
can express the effect music has upon us?
Musio is a universal' language which all com
prehend. All music belongs to God and snould
be used for his glory. The devil has seized
some of the Dest of it and is using it for his
own purpose, but it does not belong to him.
"Have you heard SOusa's band? 1 heard it,
or him, or them, or however you have a mind
to designate the combination. 1 am not sure
but I would best say htm. The maestro said
not a word, blew not a note, yet seemed the
soul of it all. With his little stick he seemed
to play on all the pipes and horns and drums.
The -music, soft as velvet, Bwoet as honey,
sparkling as the morning dew, seemed to drip
in showers and dash in torrents from his fin
gers. The elfs of sweet sound would hurry out
and laugh at his beck, or run away and hide
in silence at his bidding. With that magic
little wand he seemed with a touch to break
the air into a mass of glittering diamonds and
fling them at the feet of any wno would take
them. He made us all rich with, the shining
treasures.
"I thought I learned some lessons from the
band. We would all best submit to leadership,
or, if you please,' to dictatorship, some timep.
The splendid music never would have been
possible if each individual player had not sub
mitted his judgment and tastes to the leader,
so far as the work in hand was concerned.
Suppose we should all submit as implicitly to
Christ in our religious work. How discords
would be hushed! How the warring of factions
would cease! How God would take the single
isolated notes and braid them into the
triumphal march of a church whose faith
should grasp the conquest of the world, and
whose skill would soon accomplish it."

*-- ' â¢PLAYED THE DUMMY ACT.
How a Sixteen -Year- Old Boy
Deceived a Community for
Six Months.
CREATED A DECIDED SENSATION.
Suspected of Fraud in a Montana
Mining Camp the "Deaf-Mute" Is
Tested by Neck-Stretching.
COLFAX, Wash., Feb. 13. -This town
has experienced a decided sensation
within the past fortnight, and the young
bloods and poker sharps hereabout are
now commiserating one another on their !
common failings and follies. The story in
trie rreruises is novel and rich. *Six
months ago a deaf-mute swung from a
brake beam of an Oregon Short Line
freight train into Colfax. He was about!
16 years of age and not bad looking; and I
â when he confronted a citizen with a tablet !
snd a pencil and scratched down the tale I
" While playing dummy I profited often by tips that were not intended for my ears."
of his sad affliction, his poverty, and his I
eagerness to lind employment, it is no
wonder that the charitably inclined resi
dent became the champion of the unfor
tunate youth, and was instrumental in
obtaining employment for him.
The youngster realized the answer to
his desires for a bread-winning occupation
in the black-art department of a bristle
chasing establishment. The barber's
patrons jestingly expressed the hope that
the deaf-mute would some day wield the j
Damascus blade and camels-hair brush of !
the tonsorial expert, and finish up a job of !
trimmine, shaving, shampooing, singeing â¢
and curling in a reasonable period of
time without frequently stopping to re
peat last year almanac joKes and snicker
over them in the patron's face.
Colfax's age and youth had a world of
fun and merriment at the expense of the
deaf-mute. They called him all sorts of
comical names, and scolded and criticized
him in a way that no boy with the faculty
of hearing would endure for a moment.
The more sage of the inhabitants would
sometimes observe that "it was lucky for
Brown and Smith that the bootblack" was \
Etone aeaf, for he'd Bmr^li the head of one
or both of them if he knew what shameful
things were said of him by Smitn and
Brown."
Hut the poor boy went on polishing
Bhoes, totally oblivious to the fact that he !
was a target for all the variegated aDuse !
and unlovely tongue-thrusts of the smart
counter-jumper and the brazen-faced card
sharp.
The deaf-mute, however, became popu
lar among the townspeople. Of evenings
he frequented cirdrooms and indulged in
the gambling habit to an extent limited
only by bis means. Smart clerks and
tricky card-players put up jobs on
"dummy." They would engace h:m in a
tÂ»oker game, and their friends, stationing
themselves at the hack of "dummy's"
chair, would overlook the deaf-mute's
hand and call out the measure of its
BtrengLh. '"Dummy," somehow, played in
luck. The odds of the dishonest practices
were admittedly against him, but, never
theless, once in a while his hand would,
somehow, escape the scrutiny of the pry
ing eyes at his back, and "dummy" would
fall in for a winning. When t;.e deaf
mute captured a "pot" his fellow-playera
applied base epithets to him, but he
merely continued to smiie cis seemingly
perpetual smile. Compliments and "cuss
words" were all the same to him, because
he couldn't hear.
Six months after the deaf-mute struck
Colfax, or about a fortnight ago, he sud
denly dropped out of the community. He
left "between two days," and did not leave
empty-handed. The townspeople " were
naturally shocked to learn that the inno
cent-looking youth who could neither
speak nor bear, who was always so willing
to do whatever service he was signaled to
perform, and who appeared to be so con
tented with his Colfax lot, had vanished
from the scenes that had known him for j
haif a yearâ baa vanished simultaneously |
v.ith his employer's stock of razors,
brushes, cosmetics and patent headwasb.
Now the barber is a sort of a Sherlock
Holmes on a small scale. When he dis
covered that "dummy" and the shop sup
plies were gone he was hot, and some
of the words that passed his lips may have
Ringed the drooling hairs of his mustache.
He bathed his head and became cool;
with coolness came deliberate thought,
and, as a*result of djliberation, the master
of strop and clipper sought the Sheriff of
Whitman Count\*and poured his tale of
woe into that official's ear. The rieeing
"dummy" was located by desciption at the
village of Garfield, ten miles distant. The
barber was deputized to arrest him. Upon
arriving at Garfield about the lirst person
lie ran across was "dummy,' ' who, to the
barber's utter amazement, was with glib
tongue seeking to induce a tradesman to
purchase the stolen articles.
"Charlie Shultz, I want to see you," ex
claimed the barber, recovering' from his
surprise.
"Don't know you," replied the deaf
mute. "My name is not Bnultz. do
you want of me?"
The barber flashed the warrant for "dum
my s ' arrest and laid hold of the articles
in the prisoner's possession. The boy
sv.ore that he had never been in Colfax,
and claimed that he had a twin brother
who was a deaf-mute; but Shultz was
taken to Colfax, where a magistrate
charged him with grand larceny.
"\ our Honor," said the late deaf-mute,
"if you'll produce anybody who will swear
that these tools and things are .worth over
$oO I'll plead guilty to grand larceny."
As a result of the boy's keenness he was
allowed to plead guilty to petty larceny.
The other day in the County Jail at Col
fax Shultz informed your correspondent
that lie tiad played the "deaf-mute" game
in a dozen cities.
"I have won at cards," he said, "simply
by profiting by the talk carried on by
smart persons behind me who were cran
ing their necks to give my liana away to
players bent on doing me up.
"The 'dummy' business came very near
winding up my career, though, in a Mon
tana mining camp," continued Shultz, as
he assumed a comfortable position in his
bunk. "The miners pitied me, I suppose,
and helped me a good deal, too. I worked
around one camp for some time at odd
jobs, and I gambled there witli fellows
who cracked bad jokes at my expense,
but I won games by keeping ears open,
mouth shut and eyes staring in one direc
tion. The least unwary movement of the
eye would give me away. 1 profited so
! often by tips that were not intended for
I my ears that the shrewd miners finally
suspected me. Possibly somebody heard
me snore in my sleep, or even talk in my
sleep. At all events a gang captured me
j one night, placed a rope around my neck,
and escorted me to a tree with a lynch law
| history a short distance from the settie
i merit.
" 'Speak, now, or we'll string you up to
j that tree,' said the leader, with an oath.
"I thought to myself, 'It I speak now
! they'll hans me, sure; so I'd Better take
j chances of hanging as a dummy.' I
clinched my teeth.
'"Speak, or up you go,' yelled the
leader. I paid no attention to him, only
stared around, wonderiugly, as it were.
"The noose tightened. Suddenly I was
drawn slowly up inro the air. I was Jet
down again and enjoined to speak, but I
stayed with my Â»ame,
"They gave me another Jift into the air
and then released me, with a fair warning,
written and spoken, to quit that camp
without dela3\ I couldn't quit those parts
too speedily to suit myself.
"lJurinc my six months in this town I
have heard more things than would be
possible for a man who was known to have
his voice and hearing. It requires some
pretty fair acting to be a successful 'deaf
mute,' in spite of ali the slurs and flings
and abuse heaped by people on such an
unfortunate. For one thing you find out
what fools some people are."
Charley fihultz is the "hero" of the jail
in which he is serving out his sentence,
and many erstwhile smart people, espe
cially among the young bloods and sports,
are now, as a matter of course, more mod
est and re erved. The next "deaf-mute"
who comes to town will be regarded with
caution, and may be treated with respect.
CLEVEE SHOPLIFTERS.
Two ArreÂ«ted and Identified by Several
of Their Victims.
For some weeks past two shoplifters, a
colored man and a wbjte man, have been
operating, particularly in tailor-shops and
clothing-stores, and about twenty com
plaints have been received at police head
quarters-
They would enter a store and while
one would pretend to make a purchase his
companion would sneak off with some ar
ticle or articles held underneath his over
coat, which he had placed conveniently
near on entering.
Detectives Gibson and Wren were de
tailed on the case, and they suspected
Thomas Johnson, a colored man, and Wil
liam Garratt. They left the City and went
to San Jose, but returned Friday night
and were arrested.
Yesterday they were identified in the
City Prison by R. Finking. 341 Kearny
street, who lost a bolt of cloth : A. Koberts,
1000 Stockton street, six pairs of trousers;
Wall Chung, 729 Washington street, a bolt
of cloth ; R. Lubeck, 651 Clay street, a shot
gun; Jacob Shens, 653 Washington street,
ten pairs of trousers; H. Cohen, Grant
avenue and Sutter street, four pairs of
trousers; and A. Noble, Broadway and
Stockton street, a bolt of cloth. Charges
of petty larceny will be booked against
them.
Culhreth's Arrest.
Koberth E. Culbreth says that his arrest was
nothing more nor less than a piece of spite work.
Mr. Culbreth holds a receipt for the Argus of
February 3 as evidence that he could not have
procured the papers unlawfully. He promises
to have his accuser arrested for perjury when
the cube conies up next week.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1896.
CARPENTERS IN DEBATE.
An Interesting Mass-Meeting for
the Benefit of the
Craft.
Several Suggestions as to How the
Laboring Man's Condition Can
Be Improved.
Two weeks ago the District Council of
Carpenters and Joiners called a niass
meeting of carpenters, union and non
union men, for last evening. The meeting
was held last evening, according to the call,
at 117 Turk street, but there was not the
number present that was expected. How
ever, what was lacking in numbers was
made up by enthusiasm.
J. E. McYicker, president of the District
Council, called the meeting to order and
was selected as the chairman. He stated
that the purpose of the gatheiing was to
discuss matters of benefit to the trades
unions. He introduced the carpenters'
district organizer, E. L. Malsbury, who in
speatdng of the gathering not being up to
expectations said:
We have a membership sufficient: to fill the
floor and the galleryâ over 1500 inemr>ors.
When I called ihe lirst mass-meetiug last April
we had even less than we have to-night. After
that mass-meeting about six men were mi
! tiated and from thnt time to the present the car
penters' membership rolls have been increas
ing rapidly and steadily. What we vim for is
a better condition of our craftsmen. We have
already obtained a $3 a day rate and an eight
hour working rule. We will demand $3 50 as
a minimum on April 1. We have, as I said,
between 1400 and 1500 men, but there are
still between 300 and 400 carpenters who are
not in the unions. I would impress upon you
all the importance of getting every carpenter
into the unions. Once you get these men in
â with you and you will be able to secure our old
rate of wages of â $.'{â  50 a day. We wish to give '
, the contractors plenty of notice so they will
not be the losers on contracts they make for
the spring.
R. T. Mclver of the Painters and Deco
rators' Union made the speech|of ttie even
ing. He attributed the unhappy condition
of the laboring classes to their own coward
ice and apathy in not standing up and
lighting for their rights, instead of letting
the unprincipled manipulators steal little
by little even the very bread from their
mouths.
He said that the carpenters are not en
thusiastic enough in building up their
trade. They seem to feel that they are al
ready well organized. They do not feel
the suffering in the community caused by
their apathy. Without organization the
workingmen are helpless. These remarks,
he said, apply to all trades unions. Mr.
Mclver added:
I believe in the boycott and in the strike
when well applied and judiciously used; but
like the boomerang in the hands of the un
skilled they will come back and strike the
striker. In the hands of the skilled marksman
the weapon brings down the enemy, and so
with the strike and boycott. What you lack is
discipline and unity in your efforts and pur
poses. The skilled workmen are better paid
than any other class, but what are we doing
for those on the outside? Women ar.d girls,
pale, i!l-clothed, ill-fed, working for $3 a week
â what are we doing for them? Look at the
little children selling papers and working long
hours â what are we doing for them? Nothing,
and we are to blame for this all. Nor is this all.
Look at the hundreds of labor-saving inven
tions. These have driven thousands out of
employment. When will your time come and
what will you do when your time comes? You
must take in and organize both skilled and
unskilled. You must cease this apathy and
fight for your rights and the rights of your
neighbors. . â  â  â¢
In discussing matters of political econo
my Mr. Mclvei asked how many men pres
ent own their own horn^s. Only one man's
hand was raised arjd he admitted that the
home is not paid for yet, whereupon the
speaker said that the very men who build
homes are homeless,. and because they are
all cowards and are afraid to fight shoulder
to shoulder for the rights of all.
it is, he said, a class war that the labor
ing men must wage against those who
have robbed them. This must be done or
the laboring, classes will go lower down,
and they have gone lower in a short time
than ever before in the history of â¢ man
kind. This can be accomplished by at
tending to the selection of those' wno
make the laws. It can be done by the
ballot and he hoped that violence would
' not be necessary.
W. H. Hutchinson, president of the Car
penters' and Joiners' Union No. 483, made
a few remarks, in which he referred to the
benefit all workmen derive from the vic
tories won by those who are organized, and
said that those who are benefited should
assist in the battles.
Henry Meyers, also of the union, spoke
of the evils of unrestricted immigration
and of the recent manifestation of interest
in the general labor movement. Meyers
said : "
, '- If the labor movement enthusiasm Is kept ;
up something will break loose in San Fran
cisco before very long. In tne past, while we
have won a few boycotts and strikes, still we
have not won' a single victory over those
who are interested in trusts. There is only
one way of winning our rightÃ, and that is by
the liberal and intelligent use of the ballot.
A while ago the great masses of the people de
manded an eight-hour law, and we got it.
This shows can be done by the organized
itiL'vr. Butwliat aas all that amounted to
This law has been violated until it is a dead
letter on our lav books.
P. H. McCarthy, the president of Car
penters' Union No. 22, stated that he be
lieved that there would have been a larger
attendance if the members of the craft had
been pr. perly notified. He said that while
capitalists are all right, they have no right
to pursue the course they are at present,
for they are dragging the lives out of the
bodies of thousands of workinarnen.
Henry Schadt of No. 483 made a neat ad
dress upon the aims and objects of trades
unionism.
District Organizer Malsbury stated that
there will be another mass-meeting within
a week or two that will call out all of the
craft, as several live topics will be on the
carpet for discussion.

State. There has been a steady rush of
people. They have been investing consid
erably and money has grown more plenti
ful. Moreover, there is a good crop of
oranges and otber fruits.
In the high ground around Redlands,
Highlands and similar towns the oranges
are in excellent condition. There was no
frost, whatever. Even tomato vines grow
ing within three or four inches of the
ground were not injured. Mr. Selkirk has
taken pains to get reliable reports of the
condition of the oranges from the various
districts. He says much pains is being
taken by the growers in boxing the citrus
fruits, so as to make them as attractive as
possible.
"Good orange land, with trees that in a
year or two will be in full bearing, may be
bought there now at from $200 to $;JOO an
acre," said Mr. Selkirk, "and a man with
say fifteen acres of this land will have a
very handsome income. I know one man,
a Mr. Cousin of Ohio, who bought such an
orchard eight years ago, and he recently
averaged $500"au acre for his crop, which
for one year is pretty good. Of course, he
had some expenses, but he must have had
$200 to $300 an acre as a profit, at least.
"San Bernardino is in a more prosperous
condition than it has been for a long lime.
Generally speaking, the whole of Southern
California is."
Mr. Selkirk will only lie here a few days.
He will probably go on to Sacramento be
fore returning south.
Potrero Democratic Club.
Democratic Ciuo No. 1 of the Thirty-third
Assembly District met Friday evening in Man
nerbund Hall, Twenty-fourth street and Po
trero avenue. J times B. Hughes presided.
Organizing of branch clubs in the Potrero and
South San Francisco was discussed and the
choir appointed Charles Dugan, George Buttler
and James B. Hughes as a committee to organ
ize the Potrero, and Henry Birbe, Patrick Har
rington and George K. Code ior South San
Francisco. The canvassing committee was in
structed to meet once a week for consideration
of applications for membership. A constitu
tion and by-laws were adopted.
Fire in a Dwelling.
An alarm of fire was turned in through box
195 last evening at 9 o'clock for a small blaze,
caused by sparks, on the roof of a dwelling
house occupied by A. Henning at 628 Lombard
street. The building was damaged to the ex
tent of about $10.
THE STOCK MARKET.
The general plane of values at the close of the
wceic was rathPr lower than at the close of the
preceding week, but me depreciation during the
six days was insiKnificant. Indeed, there Is noth
ing at the momeut to affect the market one way or
the other, and until the mines show some develop
' ment there is not much likelihood of a mcrket.
The Crown Point, Julia and Ijidy "Washington

IN CHILDHOODS REALM.
A VALENTINE came to me. It is
a beautiful one and is such a
treasure that no matter how
tempting the offer 1 snould be
loath to part with it.
fts purchase price was not high, because
1 know that a certain little bank contained
but a few paltry dimes.
The materials of which my priceless
treasure is woven are only paper, wood and
celluloid.
I do not wonder that you are amazed
when I call it "priceless." The secret lies
"OUR HOSTESS APPEARS AS THE GODDESS OF LOVE."
[From Ilaf] er's R< u nd Ta b V. |

â Youths' Companion.
Martha Washington's Valentine.
A group of merry girls and boys were
talking with Mrs. General Washington
one February evening when one of the
number suddenly inquired: "Did you ever
get a valentine from the President?"
To which came the ready reply. "Of
course I did !" as a conscious smile rippled
over the still beautiful though, now elderly
face.
"And did you ever go to a valentine
party when you were a girl?"
"Why, of course I did," and Mrs. Wash
ington straightened herself more particu
larly in her high-back chair.
"Oh, do tell us all about it I"
And as she responded with a most in
dulgent smile they gathered close to her.
It was night in old Virginia when, for
the entertainment of our visiting friends,
grandmot'.er laid aside her knitting and
glided slowly, stately, gracefully around
the Tjom. She was dancing the minuet.
Unexpectedly my maid entered, bearing
a tray on which was a white envelope
sealed with rose-colored wax, imprinted
with a laughing cupid. I was much em
barrassed at receiving this before so many
curious eyes, and warningly looked at the
girl, but it was too late: indeed, her ready
words made me only the more conspicu
ous.
"I 'member to watch, kase nver sence
dcv here"â with a nod of her head in the
visitors' direction â "young misses mons'us
quiet !"
Fearing she might tecome yet more gar
rulous, I hurriedly asked. "Nancy, did the
carriage return from the King's mill plan
tation?"' and the girl left the room to in
quire.
It was St. Valentine's eve. And who
had sent this beautiful valentine â for
beautiful I knew it wasâ notwithstanding
that as yet the seal remained unfastened?
Would I open it before all these guests, or
would I make excuse and go in hiding?
Grandmother settled the question by in
quiring, "Valentine, dearie? Many's the
one I got when I wan a pirj."
"I suppose you did, grandma, for you've

that I was, with a quick rush of the red
blood all over my face, even to the roots of
my hair, "I've heard, too, that her daugh
ter, when at my age, was just the comeliest
maiden possible â so modest, so sensible
and loving, with hair resembling flax,
and cheeks like May blossoms."
These words caused grandmother to
come closer, and scrutinizing my face she
a.sked, :- \Vhy, what's put Mary Ball into
your head, child?" And not waiting for
reply added, "You cannot deceive your
old grandmother. You might as well cive
up now as at any other time." And point
ing to the still unopened valentine, while
told me you were much like your old
friend Madam Ball, and she was a great
belie": and then continuing, foolish child
! looking at the group of visitors, she tan
talizingly saiÂ«l, "Open it, dearie, and see
what (lecrge has sent you."
This was too much "and I fled from the
room.
(i rand mother was right and I knew it, j
for I was learning to know George Wash- j
ington's handwriting, and I was already |
planning how I would tease him when we j
met at the party to be given the following
evening at the Oaklands, to which home i
we were both invited.
There had lately been a wedding at our
bouse â a cousin of my mother was the
, brideâ and such a gay time as this excite
i ment had brought. George Washington
was among the guests and I was much
pleased because he danced with me several
times.
Referring to an old Virginia wedding,
there is nothing comparable to it, as the
preparations go regularly on for successive
nights and days â such preparations as
ruffle-crimping, jelly-straining, cocoanut
grating, egg-frothing, silver-cleaning, to
i be ready for guests who arrive a few daya
! before, and, as in our case, remain for* a
week or more afterward. Nor do the
guests arrive alone; they come in their
private carriages, with horses and an army
of negro servants to be entertained. Just
think of the numberless rice-walrles, beat
-1 biscuit, light bread, muffins and laplands
â  to be brought hot on the breakfast table!
j and the ham, dried venison, turkey, fried
chicken, cinnamon cakes, quince manna
â  lade on the tea table! Oh, a wedding
. meant an out-and-out stir in those days!
But our house was a large old place in the
j midst of scenery both lovely and pictur
j esque, and we owned many negroes, wiio
; had been taught all sorts* of work, and
therefore it was easy for us to prepare.
j Indeed, our head cook. Aunt Tamer, was
a character, black and portly, but cleanly
turban ed and white-aproned. â¢ I seem to
hear her now praising her own concoc
'â  tions, and she was especially proud of
I "bakin' de bes' beat-biscuit an' loaf bread."
But I was talking about my valentine
: and the party. Probably because the fete
; of St. Valentine belongs to nearly every
country, and since the fifteenth century it
was exceedingly popular in England and
France, the girls were asked to wear lif- !
teenth-century costume; my dress was of !
the finest white mull, as fine as a spider's ,
I web, and embroidered with lilies-of-the- |
valley. The boys' clothes were in exact i
| copy of old English gentlemen, and they !
; wore long queues tied with black ribbons, !
I wsd'- ruffled shirt fronts, short breeches i
! and knee-buckles. The decorations were j
i eiaboruieâ pink roses and rosebuds in
I solid banks of lavishness. Indeed, the
I large square rooms ?Â»emed transformed '
; into flower-gardens. One exquisite effect
â  was produced with magnolia leaves and I
j wax candles. These leaves formed a cor- i
1 nice to the drawing-room ceiling, and the
candles were so deftly placed that only
the lighted tapers "were seen. They
1 shone like stars on a summer's

night, for the dark green gloss on
the large leaves acted as reflectors,
while suspended from the ceiJimr's center
were several rows of pink satin sash rib
bon, each piece hanging so gracefully that
when the ends were fastened about four
feet below the cornice the ceiling was as
effective and beautiful as the most critical
fresco-painter could desire. Where each
end was fastened there was a large bunch
of magnolia leaves and candles assimilat
ing a side chandelier, and in the center of
the ceiling there were magnolia leaves in
profusion.
No sooner was I in the drawing-room
than my friend George Washington gal
lantly advanced and begged me to do him
the honor of being his partner in the co
tillon. After that there followed many
other dances, all of which he would ask
me to dance; but I did not forget he had
sent me a valentine the night before, and,
therefore, I decided to tease him by danc
ing with some of the other boys, especially
with my particularly kind friend, young
Custis.
We had reels, cotillons and schottisches
almost without number; but the dance
just before supper was arranged for the
occasion and called St. Valentine. Our
hostess suddenly appeared in soft, fleecy
white stuff, with spangled wings, as
Venus, the goddess of love, her mother
explained. First dancing one of the plan
tation dances that her old mammy had
taught her, she sang a song about valen
tines; then taking a gilded basket and
coquetting through the drawing-room in
the most graceful of reel steps, she gave a
valentine to each guest. Then again
dancing another of the plantation dances
she as gracefully withdrew.
A few moments later a musician's voice
called, "Choose your partners by match
ing valentines";" and thus again George
Washington advanced, and linding that
his valentine really was the exact counter
part of mine, we waiked to our places in |
the now rapidly forming minuet, and i
altorward we marched together up and
down the rooms and through the wide
halls to supper.
After supper we played several games,
one of which represented prominent char
acters and some not so prominent â for ex
ampip, making believe we were our own
mothers or fathers. In this way Colonel
hall of Lancaster, who was George Wash
ington's erandfather, was taken, and Au
gustine Washington, his father. Geoige
Washington himself took the character of |
George 111, while I took the character of
Betty Washington, his sister. But some
of the other boys and girls preferred rep

ers, of the same blood as Sir Walter
Raleigh, and other titled gentlemen and
women. Those who were to be guessed
decided for themselves who they would be.
Then al! the quests asked questions, to
which correct answer was given. If the
name was not guessed within five minutes
it had to be told, for longer than live min
utes made the game too tedious.
This game was followed by two of the
girls taking seats in the middle of the !
room. They had previously withdrawn j
and put over their pretty dresses queer
looking old shawls, and covered ttioir
chestnut-brown curls with odd -looking
bonnets tied under the chin. Then a cup
of tea was given to each, and looking iÂ»
--[ tently at one another, slowly stirring their
| tea meantime, one exclaimed in a high
pitched voice, "You don't say so!" where
upon our hostess inquired. '"Who can tell i
what these girls represent?" and a number
of voices replied, "Gossip." At this an
swer the girls rose and laughingly threw
aside their shawls and hats.
Then the youngest boy took one of the
chairs made vacant by the eirlg. After
seating himself it was noticed that he put
a big coat over his lap, and making a big
show of threading his needle he diligently
sewed on a button. And the hostess
anked, "What does Charley represent?"
The children could hardly reply for laugh
ing, for the boy looked so demure and in
dustrious; hut after a moment's hesitation
there came the vigorous answer, "A bach
elor."
Then Aunt Charlotte, an old negro
woman, entered; she pretended to be a
fortune-teller. And I afterwards learned
her coming had been all arranged by the
hostess, to whom I had been foolish enough
to tell of the advent of my valentine.
She approached me first, and prostrated
herself, face downwards, on the tioor.
"Why, Aunt Charlotte!" 1 exclaimed, "do
get up."
"Lor", honey, I never specs to see de
greates' ladie in de lan'."
"Well, stand up," was my agitated re
ply, "and explain what you mean."
"Bless de chile! I love to think I'm
some 'count."
"Hurry!" was my impatient exclama
tion, "I can't wait." And all my young
friends were grouped close around, zeal
ously listening for what the old creature
was about, to say.
"I mean you'll make the grandes' mar
riage 'bout here."
"Whom will 1 marry?" were mv now
eager though venturesome words.
"Why, de young mars' who sent you de
valentine."
I was so provoked with myself that I
could have bitten my tongue'off, though,
after all, it was a most natural answerÂ°to
give on St. Valentine's night; and thus
having decided my future, Aunt Charlotte
hurriedly turned to another, and yec an
other, as both boys and girls pressed for
ward for their turn. When she reached
George Washington I listened closely. She
told him he would ride in a coach and six,
and that "we've nuver seen such wondrous
time as 'Mar? George '11 have."
When the fortune-telling was concluded,
I learned that it was already considerably
beyond the time to start home, and there
fore speedily made my adieux; a few
moments later found me in our high
sreuneu carriage rapidly rolling out of the
Oakland grounds.
''And thus ended the episode which I
promised to tell you," said Martha Wash
ington, the wife of the commander-in
chief of the Continental army and Presi
dent of the United States, to the French
officer De Grasse at the oeace bail given in
Fredericksburg.
"Pardon, madam; not ended, but rather
begun," was the courtly response.
"Oh, what a lovely party!" was the ex
clamation from many of the attentive lis
teners. "And why couldn't we repeat it
now?" was the immediate question.
"Indeed I shall," said one of the girls,
with a decided shake of her long curls.
"My very next party will be an old Vir
ginia evening â dresses, dances, games and
ail."â Emma J. Gray in Harper's Round

DONALD SEKIES^NO. XVI.
fOX Tl>'Y BOYS.
Our funny little boy has made a garden,
and I'm sure never before was garden
made as his, and I feel certain that you
will think just as I do when you read how
he made it.
One day, not long ago, his mamma gave
him a small plat of ground "all for his
very own," and she also gave him a hand
ful of seeds, two kinds, nasturtium and
sweet pea.
As the ground was bo soft alter tht rain,
Donald scon had made many little holes
in his plat, into which he poured his seeds,
leaving them mixed. aLw
The next day the little boy received a
present of a silver dollar, so the very first
time he went uptown after this he spent
j his dollar for a set of garden tools â a rake,
a hue and a spadeâ with good, long han
dles.
Just as soon as they were delivered Mas
ter Donald went to work. They were tine !
He placed the spade on the ground, put
his foot up on one side of it, pressed hard,
and brought it up just full of dirt. Then
i he turned it over and chopped the dirt
; with the sido of the spade, exactly as he
hrtd seen Patrick, the garener, do.
Well, in a shorter time than I can tell
you, Donald had I -is garden all spaded.
When little "Rags" saw his master
working so hard he wanted to work, too.
So every time Donald turned his bacK the
doggie would dig as fast and as hard as he
could witl< his two front paws and his
shiny nose besides, making the dirt fly ail
over the yard.
Donald did not like this at all. So in
order to keep his mischievous pet from
spoiling his garden he nailed boards all
over the top of it close to the ground.
And now the little boy is waiting for the
plants to appear, and Donald's mamma
wonders if any flowers will ever grow in
that garden, and if they do what kind of
flowers they will be.
Slie thinks, too, that Donald's way of
planting the seeds lirst and dierging up
the ground afterward is a very strange
way in which to make a garden.

(trij:.)
A tired mother was trying to wash her
three-year-old boj's face. Trying, I say.
for every time sponge touched saucy nose
off the little feet scampered, carrying
laughing face far out of mother's reach.
In a moment of despair she said, "Oh,
darling, if you don't be a good boy and
allow me to wash your face, mamma will
get sick and go away ; then papa will bare
to buy you a new mamma." "Umph,'
answered the child, "we can't buy mam
mas, (io'l makes mammas."
A little boy after suying his prayers one
evening turned to his mother with the In
quiry, "Where's Mrs. God?"
One night after a. vain attempt to soothe
her six-year old boy to Slumberland by
singing the rhymes of dear old "Mother

"Dear rock, because of your kindness to

My Friend Wiggins.
You should see Wiggins; he is the drollest
fellow imaginable. When he walks he glides
along with such a funny motion that even the
most sedate have to laugh. Most people say,
"Poor Wiggins," he must be in misery ; why do
you not cut short his days? But his little
mistress protests against such talk for she
knows Wiggins is happy and enjoys life.
When food is placed before him he performs
most curious antics, for he is very greedy and
tries hard to get all in sight before his com
panions surpass him, but owing to his con
struction when he bends his head he often
misses the spot for which he aimed, especially
when he gets a little excited by seeinc his
mates devour so much.
But he never loses his patience; he only
gives forth a chuckle, which seems to mean
"Wiggins will get there."
â¢ When we first made his acquaintance he was
very timid, and if one put their hand on him
he squawked like a spoiled boy. Now he sits in
the lap of his mistress, eats" from her hand
and they chatter away most knowingly.

The Bad Memory of Rogues.
Possessed of encaging manners and not
too far advanced in years, a young woman,
aided by her charms, imagined a new and
successful way of gaining a dishonest liv
ing. Her way was to stroll carelessly
along, taking care to ogle the drivers of
the delivery vans of the big shops. When
sljo had fixed on a suitable victim she
would ask him which way he was going.
No matter to what quarter of the city his
business led him. ii always happened to
be the direction in which the fair maiden
desired to go. She would ask him
pressingly if he would object to
taking her with him, and so save
her the trouble of walking. Nino
times out of ten the coachman consented.
The deceitful damsel then jumped up be
side the accommodating driver and made
herself excessively agreeable, wheedling
herself into the man's favor that he quite
forgot to keep an eve on his money bag at
his feet. Not so" the female thief, for
while keeping up the blanishments she
would gradually transffr the contents of
the bag to her own pocket. The vehicle
was then stopped and she would disappear,
after gayly wishing her conductor good
day. It was only when too late that the
coachman discovered his Joss. Unfortu
nately for the continued success of the
plan, mademoiselle had a bad memory
and did not remember faces. Recently
she accosted a man who had already suf
fered from her depredations. He promptly
accepted her request and drove her straight
to the nearest police station, where he
gave her in charge.â Taris Letter.

ONE of the strangest giant ances

day belong to the smaller races
of animals, has been recently
discovered m Australia, writes J.
Carter Beard in Popular Science. Among
the queer creatures that exist in that

into your hands like a child and making
little leaps upon its feet. It has a queer
way of turning in its toes when it walks,
and the bottoms of its flat feet are quite
bare. It has wniskers like a cat, only they
are much thicker and more numerous.
Just imagine â this roly-poly pet of a
creature had a great, great grandfather
that verily deserves to be called any num
ber of times great, for ho was really and
truly larger than a rhinoceros.
The bones of this great wombat, now in
the Adelaide Museum in South Australia,
were found at a place called Lake Mulli
gan, a dismal spot. The so-called lake is
no lake at all, except after very heavy
rains; is at all other times a plainof black
mud over which lies like snow an incrusta
tation of salt, a treacnerous covering
through which one is apt to break and sink
forever out of sighr in the mire beneath.
The country surrounding it is a vast stony
desert void of life. Here sandstorms occur
terrible to think of, and the miaday heat
is like that of a furnace, 111 degrees.asour
thermometer registers temperature in the
shade.
More than a hundred different extinct
hirds and mammals new to science have
already been represented in the bones
found here, and goodness Knows how
many will be before the place is exhausted.
Perhaps the remote ancestors of the
Dlprotodon, which is the name given by
men of science to the ancient giant wom
bat, were still larger than any yet found,
and remains may be discovered "still more
ancient, which will rival those of the
Megatherium or fossil sloth in size.

and many noble traits, they yet resemble
the Arabs in their want of "honesty. A
story is told of a chief of theirs, Mokrani,
which makes us thitok the days of chivalry
are not yet gone. When worsted in the
Franco-German war in IS7I, the French
had to withdraw their troops from Algeria,
and thus a grand opening was made for
insurrection. Mokrani would not rebel,
as he had pledged his word to the Algerian
Governor that there would be no rising
against the Frjench authority till the war
was over. Even when a peace had been
made, and he was" thus released from his
promise, he gaye forty-eight hours' notice
to the French of his intention to com

he was a hero, and he died a hero's death
in the thick of battle.

A CAT THAT TTII.L.' SCAKE RATS.
The wonders of science never cease. The
latest contribution to the United States
Patent Officeâ No. 305,102â is an auto
matic, double-action, scientific mouse
trightener. It is nothing more nor less
than the statuette of a cat, painted and
whiskered with realistic effect, with big,
phosphorescent eyes that gleam brilliantly
in trie. dark.
"Ths cat," so runs the inventor's de-

scription, "is pa in ted to. present an ' at
tractive apbearance.' It is shown in a sit
ting posture, with' its .head turned to one
Bide and its eyes staring straight ahead."
, These eyes are thickly coated with phos
phorescent paint, which shines like" a flame
in *a" dark room. All you have to do is to
place the cat on the floor near a mouse
nole and then wait for results. The scheme
has been a tremendous success. The only
drawback to it is that it does not eat the
mice. These statuettes will . be made of
clay, of plaster of paris, of terra-cotta and,
for the very rich, of , pure Carrara marble.
A Broadway merchant whose storerooms
are infested with rats introducod one of
these phosphorescent cats into his place
the other day. The effect was truly amaz
ing. . " . .
"There is one big hole in the corner of
our salesroom," said to a reporter, "out
of which all the rats seemed to come. We
placed the cat immediately in front of this
opening, and immediately the nuisance
ceased". .Throughout the nis<ht the cat's
eyes gleamed like fire.
â  "Yesterday, when I went to the store,
what do you think 1 found? A strong
odor from that particular corner of the
â¢room led to an investigation by our porter.
He reported tliat he had found a dead rat
in the hole. The animal had died of star
vation. What a terrible death that must
have been!'- The animal had probably
poked his head out of the hole and had
found the eyes of the cat gleaming bale
fully upon him. Two or three such ex
periences no doubt discouraged him, and
â while be lay in'hidihg waiting for the cat
to go away he must have starved to death.
I am going to buy three more of these
â cats." - - â 'â -â  ; '- ; â â  - :. .-,.- â . .. .
Aside from beinjr good to frighten rata,
these cats make an amusing mantel orna
ment. It is rather startling, thouprh, to
enter a dark room and find yourself : con
fronted with two balls of .fire that seem to
gleam out of the wall. .:;"
ARMY CREMATOpiES.
A novel exhibit will be seen at the Berlin
Industrial Exposition next summer. A
Polish engineer has invented an ambulant
crematory for military purposes. The ob
ject of this invention is to make use of the
hygienic advantages of cremating for the
disposal of the bodies of dead soldiers on

battlefields instead of burying them in
numbers, thereby creating the danger of
epidemics. The military authorities of
Germany have shown great interest in
this invention, and it is very probable that
the apparatus will be introduced into the
German army, each army corps being sup
plied with one ambulant crematory. They
are mounted on low wheels, and have the
appearance of the portable army baking
ovens, only that they a/c higher and
heavier. Eight horses ami six men will
furnish the equipment of each crematory.
A SEE-SAW EXPERIMENT.

beyond the flames at each end. by means of
a piece of wire, fasten two little figures,
with their joints hinged. Now, a? the
candle begins to melt, a drop of grease
will fall from one end (it is advisable, by
the way, to put something beneath to
catch it in) and that end of the canale will
rise a little above the other. Then a drop
will fall from the opposite end and a gentle
oscillation wil) begin, which gradually
increases in speed until the little figures at
the end will perform the most surprising
antics at their game oi see-saw.
BULI, - FIGHTING ON BICYCLES.
A bicycle paper of Munich relates that
bull-fights on the bicycle h.ave recently
taken place at Malaga, Spain. A picador
who is a very clever wheelmanj undertook
to enter the arena mounted on a bicycle
instead of on horseback. The steer, how
ever, was not awed appreciably by the
novel apparitions and before the daring
picador had time to retreat he took wheel
and wheelman on his horns, throwing
both high into the air. The picador got
away with a good shaking-up, as the steer
was too busy trampling the wheel into a
shapeless tangle.
ENCOURAGING AMERICAN ART.
The prizes offered by William L. Elkins,
through the Academy of Fine Arts of
Philadelphia, for the best pictures by
American artists shown at the present ex
hibition, have been awarded. The first
prize ($3000) ha 3 been given to Abbott H.
Thayer of Scarborough, N. V., for his pic
tare entitled "Caritas"; the second prize
($2000) to Edmund C. Tar Dell, instructor
of painting in the â  Boston Museum of
Fine Arts, for his "Girl With White
Azaleas." Mr. Thayer was born in Bos
ton, but studied in New York, and under
Gerome in Paris. His early successes
were with animal studies, but in recent
years he has devoted himself to figure
pieces. Mr. Tarbell was born at West
Groton, Mass., in 1862, and has studied
under Bonlanger and Lefebre in Paris.
Like Mr. Thayer he Mas been the recipient
of many honors, some of them from the
Academy of Fine Arts. The jury was
composed of Henry G. Marquand, presi
dent of the Metropolitan Museum, chair
man; John G. Johnson, Dr. A. C. Lamb
din of the Time?, and four artists, Robert
Blum and Edward Simmons of New York,
Frank W. Benson of Boston and Robert
W. Vonnoh of Philadelphia.

WOODSMAN OF THE NORTHWEST.
The woodsman writes of his own tribe
as follows: "He wears a Mackinaw shirt,
and as a rale comes from Michigan,
Sweden or Canada. The first thing he
does is to swamp, chop limbs, knock off
knots and receive the benedictions of the
teamster, who wonders how anything so
awkward found its way so far through life.
After a while he learns to chop, pull a saw
and flip a canthook. When times are hard
and wages low he goes to a camp and
slicks to work right along; when times are
pood and wages high he can'i content him
self in one place. His 'turkey' consists of
a two-bushel bag and some old clothes. If
French, he calks less in February than in
any other month in the year; still he says
all that can be said in twenty-eight days,
and his under jaw is a near approachto
perpetual motion. If Scandinavian, he
talks little, thinks slow, minds his work
and never kicks. . If Irish, he is likely to
prove a synonym for ambiguity and util
ity. The woodsman is valued according to

WARMI>O THE POPE'S PALACE.
The recurring indisposition o! the Pope
has again raised the question of heating
the Vatican, a problem which, so far, has
never yet been satisfactorily solved.
There are no fewer than 11,000 rooms in
the Papal Palace, and. many of them
never receive a ray of sunlight. Professor
Laponi, the physician of his Holiness, has
tried by all the means in his power to
maintain a normal temperature in the
private apartments, but without effect,
and they remain much too cold for the
daily diminishing vitality of the Pope.
An architect recently submitted a plan for
distributing hot air all through the Vati
can, but when the cost was mentioned â
Â£36,000 â the Pope dismissed the subject
with a wave of the hand.
BEOORDS SAY HE IS DEAD.
So a "War Veteran ' Can Get No Aid From
the Government.
On the shore of the Harlem River at
One Hundred and Thirty-first street and
Lexington avenue, in a little two-room
shanty, lives John "Wallace, a one-armed
veteran of the war. He is very much alive,
but through some error a record of his
death has crept into the Pension Bureau
at Washington; and although he has long
endeavored to secure a pension he can ob
tain no aid from the country for which he
fought.
This is the fourth winter the old man
has passed in bis little hut. He complains
bitterly that all of his friends of happier
days have deserted him. Even his only
aon has wandered away.. Only one friend
stuck to him for years, sharing his hunger
and privations. That was "Joe," hia black
hound, but the doe died a year ago.
"I'm 68 years old," said old John to me
yesterday. "My father came over from
Scotland and I was born in Norwich, Conn.
Then we went to Brooklyn, where I joined
the Volunteer Fire Department. Go ask
what's left of 'em. They all remember me.
I was a member of Company Franklin, No.
3, of which, Peter Hyde wascaptain. When
1 got married my wife Sarah's cousin came
to see us from Missouri. He said if we'd
come out with him he'd guarantee me $60
a month and all the garden truck we could
raise.
"We went, and when the war broke out
I I raised a regiment of my own in Mis
souri. At Camp Washington, Ind., 1 lost
my arm. I was lying asleep in my bunk
when the shot came, and I never knew
who fired it. I was taken prisoner, and
wasn't set free until the surrender of
Vicksburg.
"My discharge papers and all my docu
ments were in a trunk that was stolen from
me in Missouri. I've made eight applica
tions for a pension. I tried to get copies
of the original papers at Washington, but
there the records are supposed to show
that I'm dead. My wife, Sarah, died out
in Missouri, and then I came East. But
nobody wants to see me here. I can't get
any help from the Government or those
who used to know me. I have a son, and
he's floating about somewhere. Children
don't care for their fathers any more."
When Wallace first squatted on his little
plat beside tne' Harlem the stretch of
country about him was open and deserted.
Now the newly erected buildings, sheds
and piles of lumber are gradually crowd
ing him into the river. It appears that he
will soon have no means of gaining access
to the street from his shanty. Before the
new drawbridge was planned the shore of
the river also was open. Logs, boards and
driftwood floated ashore daily beside, the
shanty, and these the old man gathered
and chopped and sawed into kindling,
which he sold.
Now boathouses have closed the water
front, and Wallace is compelled to forage
about the shore for his snppiy. His shanty
consisted first of a single apartment, the
second one being an addition of later
years.
The poor veteran Is in sore need. His
clothing is ragged and insufficient to pro
tect him from the cold. Every morning
he goes over to a lodging-house opposite
the terminal station of the Third-ave
nue cable road. Kind-hearted persons
there give him his bread and bowl of
coffee,
'â¢I run my chances with the meat,"" he
added pathetically.â New York Herald.
SAFETY CHECK SYSTEM.
An Efficient Device for Pre
venting Fraudulent Al
terations.
The Contrivance Is Very Favorably
Commented Upon by Leading
Bankers.
A device for frustrating the tricks of
check-raisers is commencing to receive
some attention, from a number of the lead
ing banks and commercial houses in town.
The proposed safeguard has many features
in common with the well-known Camp
bell safety checkbook system, and is a
modification of the coupon system now in
use in tne money order department of the
National postal service. M. Leventritt of
4 Bolter street is endeavoring to introduce
the system into the financial world, end
appears very confident that it will take, as
he considers it almost if not quite flawless.
The safeguard advocated by Mr. Leven
tritt is triple. In the first place, the cou
pons prevent the raisins of checks to any
very great amount. Then drafts, checks
and letters of credit calling for sums of
$10,000 or less will be printed on pink
paper, those for sums ranging from $10,000
to $40,000 on white, and those for amounts
over $40,000 and under $100,000 on blue.
By the same ratio in value the length of
the main body of the check vanes, the
pink checks being TV inches long, the
white 8 inches and the blue BJo inches.
The coupon system appears to leave
small chance for great frauds. To the left
of eacli check is attached a number of
vertical columns bearing the inscription,
"Not over $o00," "Not over $1000," and so
on. The space 'occupied by each column
is exactly a quarter of an inch in width, so
that the length of a check alone will be to
some extent an indication of its value.
Mr. Leventritt has applied for a patent, as
some features in the system are of his own
invention.
A number of leading bankers and finan
cial authorities enthusiastically praise
the new system, and some firms have
already signified in writing their intention
to adopt it in their business. Several bank

; has forgotten and nobody in the neighbor
hood seem to have the least knowledge on
the subject. It is located on the banks of
! the Oakland estuary, or rather about 200
feet from the shore at high tide. It seems
as if there must have Been a pier there at
one time, for the stumps of a row of
broken piles reach from the house land
ward and show plainly at low tide.
Peter does not speak very good English
and it is impossible from his dialect to tell
I what country he came from. He is most
i likely a Russian. From all that can be
j learned he simply pre-empted the four
j end piles of the pier when it was aban
! doned and constructed his house on the
top from lumber ho found floating in the
estuary.
The house is not v piece of work a car
penter would be proud of. It is made of
all sorts of lumber and looks as if a good
breeze would blow it away. At high tide
it is six feet above the water, and at low
tide about ten feet. Entrance to it must
| be maae by climbing from a boat up a
half-rotten rope-ladder. The piles hare
been eaten away by the teredo and the
l structure shakes in a dangerous fashion.
I Peter has braced the piles together on the
j four sides, and this is undoubtedly all
that holds the structure together.

THE
LATEST FASHION GOSSIP FOR WOMEN AND MEN.
AT last San Francisco has been nn- j
der the spell of a great musician's
magical power and the doubting
Thomases are trying to make us
forget that they declared Pad was
only a fail, and did not the California
Theater blossom like the rose? Judging
by the api r-arance of the audience one
might have imagined it was a grand-opera
night, indeed scarcely a frumpy waist was
to be seen in all the house, and some very
swell ones were quite skyed, and next
Monday I predict that an equally fashion
able audience will greet the "Young La
dies' Orchestra," and on Tuesday those
who desire to help San Francisco's art in
stitute will be at the beautiful honse on
California street, which, for some days
past, has been in the hands of decorators
in anticipation of this event.
The buds and next year's debutantes
have been dancing their feet almost off,
and have been so gay that the dear little
souls are almost worn out, but Lent is al
ready so near that things have been rushed
and we are all quite tired out, for we who
are older and more sedate have had our
teas and crushes, our lunches, dinners and
theater parties and, of course, so large a
portion of our .people do not observe the
forty days and nights that the social hall .
will be kept rolling until the trunks are
being packed for Monterey. San Rafael,
etc. I hear there is to bs quite a large
vedding in June. Speaking of San Rafael
reminds me of the pretty wedding there
this week. The little bride was a pictur
esque figure in her bridal gown, and many
are the wishes that in luture she may find
few thorns and many roses in her married
life.
After Monday's Presidio hop there will
be no more until Easter tide, when the
lar;:e private ball will be given.
One of the prettiest affairs of the weeK
was the leav-year cotillon danced by the
young people,, and many were the airy,
rretty frocks donned for "the occasion, bin
will not go into details, as you all can
chut your eyes and see just how all the
dear girls looked, and as usual, britrht
eyes and sweet tempers and sunny smiles
won more admiration than the most elab
orate of trowns. I know of one girl who
was a great belle the moment she made
her debut, in a simple white muslin,
trimmed with lace, but her eyes and man
ners bewitched all the men", who used to
beg her to be sure and wear her muslin
dress, so celebrated did it become on ac
count of the beauty who so adorned it, and
it did not do the other girls a bit of
good to allude scornfully to "that
muslin rag" and rustle their silk
and satin skirts, for the men were all in love
with the wearer, so in their eyes nothing
compared that season to white muslin,
which certainly is far more appropriate for
than satin. Some of the girls will
not believe that out here, but they do in
New York, and although the riarty dresses
-s. Debutante may be all lined with
silk or satin, they are apparently simple
little chiffon and muslin affairs, and only
the mothers and grandmothers are re
f-plendent in rich satins, velvets and bro
cades which are beautified with rare gems
and precious laces. Girls and maidens
thould wear flowers and ribbons as long as
possible.
E of the teas given by the youthful I
element were exceedingly successful, en- '
-c affairs, and the hostesses reflected
credit on their mothers' training.
The tailor arown given here is made of
Mack vicuna cloth, and has a smart close
fitting little coat, which opens in front, re
vealing a vest of white kerseymer?

At this season of silk sale- the wise
woman will secure odd lengths of chine
silks, as they are admirable for skirt ruf
fles, and will line effectively the spring
jackets. They will appear in great num
bers shortly, with their plain tailor skirts,
and will be" our standhys durine the sum
mer, and the sleeves of such jaufcets prom
ise to remain brobdignagian in propor
tion.
The morning gown is of figured French
flannel, the cream-white ground being
covered with pure chrysanthemums. "Wide
white lace makes broad frills at the elbows
and arm holes, a pretty scrap of pink
velvet gallon embroidered in white and a
narrow frill of lace make a pretty effective
finish for the neck. Satin ribbons match
ing the flowers appear at the elbows and
around the waist, all terminating in bows.
Women cannot be too careful about mak
ing themselves attractive at all times, and
we find many who are usually faultlessly
garbed almost slovenly in theearly morn
ing, so I am a great" advocate of" pretty
wash gowns, which do good service for
breakfast, and are always sweet and fresh.
For winter dainty flannels are best, and
for summer I have found flannelettes ex
cellent; those with even the most delicate
china-blue lines or figures wash perfectly,
and now that ribbons are so inexpensive,
with few exceptions all women can afford
an abundant supply. Such gowns should
be cut a la princesse, and never indulge in
large, baggy affairs a la Mother Hubbard.
In many case's it is well to dispense with
the graceful train, for at all times it may
be in the way, but the well-cut gown is
almost as pretty without it.
A modei for a pretty evening gown
lately received from a celebrated French
house is composed of white satin with
chiffon-covered bodice and immense lovely
sleeves covered by a billowy mass of white
chiffon flouncings edged by quillings of
black chiffon; the bodice, has braces of
black velvet. Another good gown comes
from the same designers. It is of white
chine silk with far-apart black stripes and
bhirred bunches of pink and blue flowers.
The waist and skirt are in the chine, and
the sleeves consist of huge wiiite lace
sleeves over black chiffon. The under
sleoves also are of black chiffon. This cos
tume is completed by a huge bow of green
velvet at the back of" the neck.
A charming evening gown, the property
of a bride, is of white duchess satin, made
with the sleeves dropping off the shoul
ders. â¢ Over the shoulders passes a band of
satin with rosettes at the junction of the
bands with the bodice. The sleeves and
full chemisette front are of white spangled
net, and tiie gracefully draped revers are
embroidered exquisitely in silk and Dearls.
A trellised design of the same embroidery
decorates the edge of the skirt with good
effectl Another is of thick corded silk of
the palest yellow. Hands of gold sequin
trimming form shoulder straps, one of
which is continued down to the edge of
the skirt, outlining an apparent opening
skirt over full folds of gold striped net, of
which material the sleeves are also made.
Bunches of joses ornament the bodice and
skirt at one side, and a golden butterfly
holds the opposite' shoulder strap in place.
Murion Terry is now playing at the
Lyceum Theater, New York, taking the
part of Mrs. Lesden, and her gowns are
being much discussed and hL-hly cora
j mended in London. She fascinates the
[ audience on her first appearance in a sum
mer dress, simply picturesque; beneath
nlniy folds of white silk muslin gleams a
skirt of rich buttercup satin. The silk
muslin is embroidered here and therewith
a tall thistle spray. The bodice of the
Fame muslin is draped and held in place
with.loops of narrow buttercup satin ribbon.
A wide ribbon tied at the side forms the

sash. With this gown she wears a large
bat of creamy straw, on which is a cluster
of blue satin loops and a bunch of forget
me-nots.
In the second act a dark blue satin
peiisse is worthy of imitation. It iks at
the back as far as the waist perfectly, and
thence expands into voluminous fullness.
The fronts -are loose, and when thrown
back a dress of shot peacock and dark
peau de soie is seen, with a blouse bodice
and deep shoulder frills of chiffon of the
same tint. A pointed collarette of lace
relieves the gown. Her velvet hat has
many wings of iridescent peacock blues
and greens.
Miss Terry's gown in the third act is said
to be simply exquisite. The skirt is of
mirror gray peau de soie that has the sur
face of satin, but falls more softly, and the
bodice matches it, but has a. full front of
gray gauze with bands of white lace in
sertion. The gauze sjeeves are puffed, and
are met by long gray Suede gloves. The
back of the bodice is of peau de soie, al
most close-fitting, save for a trifling
amount of fullness that loses itself be
neath a shaped belt of Parma violet velvet.
Tlje toque, worn with this toilette is of
gray velvet with clusters of Parma violets
and a black osprey aigrette.
The next costume is of pure white satin,
with a low-cut bodice. This gown is en
riched by much beautiful crystal jewel
work, and the long cloak which is thrown
over this splendor is of lime-green velvet
edged down the fronts with sable. It is
lined with white satin.
The last clever confection is a wonderful
black moire, which shows occasional effects
AN EVENING COSTUME.
of moonlight blue that dance like rays
across the somber surface. Her head and
the upper part of her figure are said to be
shrouded in diaphanous black drapery.
As a result of taking advantage of "some
of -the recent sales a pretty golden-haired
maiden looks charming in sx draped bodice
of turquoise-blue velvet, which has shoul
der-straps and waistband of cut jet. The
sleeves are of accordion-pleated black chif
fon over blue taffeta, and the skirt is of
black satin, with two ruflles of pale-blue
silk around the edge inside.
Velvet should not be passed by, for even
a small piece of two and a half yards in
combination, if on a delicate light shade,
can be used for ihe evening. The youth
ful or inexperienced shopper should avoid
bargains in jet, as only a connoisseur can
purchase satisfactorily, and cheap laces,
excepting for wash dresses, are a delusion
and a snare, as they are so emphatically
common when used with good materials.
A lovely model for a middle-aged
woman is a princess dress of black velvet,
the collar and revers of pale pink glace
silk covered with cream-colored lace and
edged with, a black chiffon frill bordered
witb Valenciennes lace. These revers can
be attached with good effect just below the
waist with handsome diamond or paste
buttons. The vest is of black chiffon
hand painted and traced with beautiful
sequins.
The dowagers are like lovely pictures
nowaday in their velvet gowns, their rare
jewels and fine laces. I must not forget
to relate that there is a new jeweled stom
acher, a flexible one, that curves in to suit
the figure. It is said to be "a marked im
provement on the old rigid scintillating
masses of stones. The designer can throw
out lovely, graceful sprajÂ», and make an
ornament that isgrace itself," and in these
days of reckless expenditures one rinds
that magnificent jeweled belts are not so
very rare among the smart set, and ex
tremely superb buckles set with precious
stones are owned by most Is'ew York
belles. â¢
Quite the most chic of parasols was
given a Paris bride last month. It was of
white silk covered with frills of costly lace,
mounted on a stick of polished steel which
was set with pearls. Among other gifts
was a pair of diamond wings for her nair
with pearl centers.
Redfern has designed a visiting Costume
for midwinter of dark blue sevres cloth,
"with a deep yoke of cyclamen velvet, ap
pl)<jue at the edge, with ornaments of
clair de lune embroidery, those immedi
ately in front being fringed. A tiny edcing
of mink fur is used to conceal the fasten
ing of the bodice. Armlets of velvet
edged on each side by clair ac iune and
outlined by mink at the waist finish the
full sleeves, arid a rosetted stock collar of
velvet encircles the neck. The skirt of
full plain shape is footed with a narrow
border of mink and the front has stoles of
the Cyclamen velvet clasped in folds at
intervals with ornaments of clair de lune.
The large hat designed to wear with the
gown is of cyclamen velvet, trimmed with
loops of shot sevres and gold satin ribbon,
fastening a cluster of shaded ostrich
plumes on the left side."
The latest fashion for a smart waistcoat,
to be worn with tailor-made coats and
skirts, is a piece of knitting cut by the
tailor to shape. The surface should be the
â¢'Hat pearl," the pattern formed by intro
ducing threads of vari-coiored wools; for
mstanee.-a red or pink waistcoat is con
i sidered stylish with a black gown, and a
I white one with a dark green serge, and
pale green ones have been seen with dark
blue. Floss silk is frequently worked in
with the wool, and this is said to be a
most decided improvement.
Paquin has been adding new luster to
his name since chiffons first appeared, for
he handles the.n with astonishing skill;
one in black and red (a combination again
in vogue) has a waist of red chiffon, which
has a black satin ribbon about four inches
wide embroidered in red sequins starting
from the neck like the old box pleat, but
divided at the ends in two iong strips
which crossed and encircled the waist,
fastening at the side. A deep collar at the
back on reaching the shoulders continues
in narrow points on to the sleeves.
Doucet is sending out some creations
with the most fascinating little zouave
coats. One dress of black duchess satin,
the back en princess, is described as
' "charming"; the front of the bodice forms
a zouave coat to the waist. There are im
mense puffs of green velvet, wing-shaped
on the shoulder, that end at the elbow in
sleeves of embroidered ecru lace, the full
piletalso being of the lace over bright
yellow velvet which "peeps out here and
there" and is edged with narrow skunk,
which is so prepared that it has the ap
pearance of fox. A collar-ruff finishes the
neck; which is fastened at the back with
numerous loopa in the yellow velvet.
Two or three dainty frocks will shortly
accompany a pretty girl down to Santa
Barbara, one of white silk with stripes of
yellow satin; the low-cut bodice is draped
with yellow net, over which are appiiqued
lace roses and seed pearls almost cover
the rest of the surface. I like her toilette
of pale blue moire silk with its Louis XVI
coat and deep corselet of white brocade
outlined with silver. The chemisette is of
blacK chiffon over white satin and the col
lar band is of the same combination and
ends in a chou of turquoise blue on either
side. I quite lost my heart to a gown she
has just received from one of our cleverest
dressmakers. It is of rose pink satin, the
skirt being adorned with ruches of black
chiffon edged with creamy lace. The
bodice of the satin is veiled with the chif
fon, which has insertions of the lace, and
frills of it edge the ruche at the neck.
The sleeves carry out the same idea, and
best of all this is an Â©Id dress done over.
That the princess gown will be. much
worn there can be no reasonable doubt, as
at two of the smartest weddings of the sea
son the mothers have worn their toilettes
so cut. One was of royal purple velvet
opening over a petticoat of white* satin em
broidered in seed pearls outlined with
gold, the revers and vest being of the
same. The other creation was of hunter's
green velvet with front of the most exquis
itely embroidered chiffon over lighter
green satin.
A quaint theater wrap, a la Pierrot,
which would please moÃt of us, is of white
Roman satin lined with ermine. The
"Pierrot" ruff around the neck is a modi
fied ane, composed of blacK and white
chiffon, black under, white over, to pro
duce a shot effect. Large black velvet
buttons go clown each side of the front ;
They have pieces of silk fixed in half
sleeve form to front lining of capelike
sleeve, so as to be used if required in cold
weather. Cape sleeves can be lined to
match the cloak.-
For early spring model hats are already
being completed in Paris. It is predicted
that a fine, fantastically woven straw, cov
ered with woodbine in the most delicate
colorings, perfectly copied from nature,
will be a favorite, Meadow-sweet is a
flower which is to be much used, being
springy and effective as the white, fluffy
branches lend themselves admirably to
the popular .aigrette effect. As usual at
this season violets will be in evidence, as
large hats of many shaded ones, with
cachepejgnes "of Nice roses, have been seen
by a New York correspondent, and f6r
a picturesque, useful chapeau I can heart
ily recommend, them as they go Charm
ingly with most summery and spring-like
costumes.
The craze for old English silver is in
creasing in proportion as the difficulty to
secure rare specimens increases. It will
soon amount to a mania, as no longer do
A TASTEFUL MORNING GOWN.
the old shops in out-of-the-way places in
Europe teem with such treasures. They
have almost all been eagerly ransacked,
and in England as much interest is being
shown In collecting tableware of the seven
teenth and eighteenth centuries as is mani
fested in this country. Tea and coffee were
introduced in the seventeenth century, so
tea and coffee pots of that period are in the
greatest demand when the hall marks are
distinctly to be seen.
Much silverware is being made in close
imitation of old English models, and as
one writer says: "It is astonishing to note
in the reproductions of the quaint old
English decorations, in flat chasing, in
pierced work, fluting, and in arabesque
borders, the irregular edges that proclaim
the handiwork of the skilled silversmith,
rather than the, perfect finish of the ma
chine. Without the aid of the hall marks
it would be diilicult to distinguish the re
productions from the originals."
Among the most acceptable of weddine
presents this year are to be mentioned the
Louis XV candelabra in silver or silver
bronze.. They have but two lights and are
low enough to be placed upon the dinner
table, where they are wonderfully effec
tive when there is a buttercup satin slip,
with guipure insertion upon the board.
The candles in this case should be yellow
and the shades can be white, with medal
lions of old engravings of court beauties;
and, speaking of dinner tables, reminded
me that the latest craze is for old two
handled, engraved glass bottles and the
red and white wine decantered therein
makes a very effective feature of the table.
Smaller presents for brides are also mat
ters worthy of thought, and old mustard
pots, or tboge which are good reproduc
tions of old styles, are acceptable, as are
also salt-cellars, pepper-boxes, liqueur
glasses upon silver rests, tiny bonboniueres
for holdinc either sweetmeats or powder
puffs, with every useful or useless article
with which we long to fill our cabinets.
Chocolate cups set in vermeil are to be
noted as novelties, beautiful hues being
much prized.
I have been reading about a gentle
woman who is a perfect vandal; she is
quite a distinguished woman, strange as it
may seem. She has 'in her possession a
rare and exquisite "old master," which
hitherto she has kept in her gallery, be
cause she did not consider the nude suit
able for exhibition in her drawing-room.
A few days ago she requested her German
governess, ah amateur artist, to psint
clothing on the figure. Naturally, the
effect is extraordinary, but it now hangs
in her drawing-room. Allow me to remark
that the lady does not live here.
Brass bedsteads contiruie in high favor,
and many are "beautifimy dressed." Ex
quisite pillow shams and spreads are now
to be had of exceedingly hne muslin or
mull, edged with a deep rulfle. Both
ruffle and spread are artistically em
broidered with a design of leaves and
flowers in white.
The heavy Renaissance and Irish lace
spreads and shams are handsome and
effective. These are very handsome, but not
so exquisitely aaintyas the musiin ones.
Lace spreads are usually seen over silk
matching the colors of the room. One
width of silk cut lengthwise is enough for
the pillows, trimmed with lace. Two
widths of the wide upholstery silk sewn
together form the spread, which should be
trimmed all around with lace set on the
silk instead of on the edge of it. Many of
the new and pretty cotton goods that come
in delicate colorings are used for this pur
pose instead, and of course the exquisite
French lawns are much in demand for
this purpose; for instance, I found one
covered with the most natural of wild
roses scattered over a white ground; this
if used 1 over pink sateen with the
best results; and 1 saw another
in a friend's room through which ran
alternate stripes of narrow light green and
milk roses that was used over green cam
bric and had a frilled edge with lace. All
properly dressed beds have the pillows
removed in the morning, their place oeing
taken by the bolster, which is round and
hard, being stuffed with hair, Hat on the
ends, where the silk brocade or cotton stuff
is gathered into a rosette. This arrange
ment is excellent, as the bed has a neat
trim look and the sheets are not visible.

TOR MEN.
The mania for collecting posters has
reached here and many bachelors' dens
are being adorned with odd ones. Not
only the best to be found in San Francisco
are in evidence, but also many from Paris,
some strikingly original.
For men some attractive articles in silver
have lately been put on the market, such
as llasks, the silver caps of which are
adorned with spurs, whips, crops and
horseshoes; a cigar-case is to be had on
which is engraved a jockey mounted ona
whip.
It is strange but true that most Amerl
ican shirtmakers still insist on making
shirts with small, little cuffs that reveal
part of the shirt sleeves every time the
hand is elevateu.
Business coats are made like shooting
coats, with three buttons, not abruptly

pockets with flairs, single-breasted and a

All the ties for spring will be gay in

most smart. In adjusting the Ascot, re
member to first form the center-piece or
knot, and having done this, the two ends
must be well elevated; they are then

the selvedge from falling away from the

much better in effect^
An authority says: *"The very best four
in bands and Ascot* are made from the de
Joinvilles. De Joinvilles can be bought in
the natural wool, from tb.e haberdasher,
for from $1 up to $.). These have a band
twined, in without cutting the silk; the
haberdasher will have this done. When
orderine the band insist that it shall be
good and wide. There is no use in purchas
ing a handsome de .Joinville if it is cut all
to pieces. When the novice becomes pro
ficient in the tying of a de Joinville, he
will cease to buy" the made-up or th 6 regu
lation and much-worn tieable scarfs of tne
lined and padded school.
"A de Joinville will not only give the
best scarf effect obtainable, but it insures
you the enjoyment of a pattern that is not

TYPICAL AMERICAN HUSBAND.
The Business Man Has Little Time to
Cultivate I'iresh'o Amenities.
The type of American husband most
familiar among us, however, is the man of
busy energies, kindly, affectionate, proud
of his family, with whom he is free-handed
and sympathetic in their pleasures, who
might if the stress of making a livelihood
would leave hire free to do so, enjoy do
mestic life heartily, and aid in bringing
the married- state to be what good old
Dicky Steele described it in the Tattler:
"A complication of all the pleasures of life
and a retreat from its inquietudes." But,
alas! under the conditions of modern
money-grubbir.g what opportunity has
the poor man to cultivate hreside ameni
ties and hang garlands upon the Lares of
his heartn? In New York, for instance,
he hurries away from home directly after
eating a hasty breakfast, to return to it
late in tne day, fagged from the incessant
and nervous grinding of the mill down
town, and ravening for his dinner.
At such a moment, all the charms and
all the virtues combined in one wife
often cannot win smiles or playful speech
from any husband so beset; and a wise
woman effaces herself until the post-pran
dial hour gives her a reasonable hope of
claiming his conversation. At this period
of the evening, unless she is a mere
monger of nursery gossip or a household
drudge, her spirit, braced and expanded
by the idea of independence and responsi
bility, is eager for the fray of ideas. She
long? for the interchange of sentiment on
current topics, while her heart (an organ
among our wive* apt to be fairly well
stored with conjugal affection) owns to a
little joyous thrill of satisfaction in the
tete-a-tete that has lost not. ing by years
of repetition. To it, even the grown chil
dren are an interruption; and she sees
them go their several ways in search of
more active entertainment with almost a
sigh of satisfaction! What, at this inter
esting juncture, is the attitude of the ideal
husband? "What, of the real husband?
These are queries to be answered by obser
vation or by experience.â North Ameri

Leap Year Sentiment.
At a public tea-party recently held in ona
of our country towns where "sentiments"
were in order a timid bachelor was bold
enough to remind the young ladies that leap
year was upon them by offering the fol
lowing:
Three Ion? weary years have I waited for this;
Now if you'll pop the question, I'll surely say
â¢â¢Yes."
To which a lady promptly responded as
follows:
The man without courage may <io his own woolnc;
May ao his own washing and baking and sewing.
The bachelor looked despair. â Spare

NFW YORK, N. V., Feb. 15.â The stock mar
kei, after a rong opening and an advance of i/^@
1-, i .'r rent, in which Bogmr, General Electric,
Manhattan and Lead and Chicago Gas were most
proTiinent.developcd weakness antl recorded losses
of anywhere from i 2 to 314 percent. Intheupward
movement Sngar was quite a feature, selling within
a fraction of 115 on the advance of l-lt;c,per
pound in certain grades of hard sugar. Lead was
RtriMjstbened by the favorable report for 1895.
â¢vhlch shows a surplus of $88,927 against a deticit
last year of â -78,184.
The particularly weak spots were Manhattan,
I.eatner preferrc-d and Tobacco, Manhattan break
ing from 108 to lC4Â»i: Leather preferrea from
681.4 to C 6, and Tobacco fell from 81 to 786 /<t .
Manhattan's weakness was due to 'the. poor state
ment for the Decembsr quarter, which shows a
tifficit of $540.57;-! against a surplus la 1894 of
? 58,251. Leather preferred was heavy on the re
iteration of the rumors that the Febrnary divi
dend will be passed and Tobacco was depressed by
aidations. The loss in the general market'
ranped from \s to li percent and was well dis
tr.rjuted.
Sugar held relativ.-ly firmer than the oiher
active-issues and closed practically unchanged on
the day. The weakness of the market was a fur
ther disappointment to the bulls, Ai o were look
ing for considerably higher figures on account of
the defeat of the silvprites in the House yesterday.
Near the close a rally of Vfc@lVs P f cent took
place, but speculation left off weaic in tone. Net
hanges show losses of V4@lÂ»i per cent. In the
inactive issues, Consolidated Gas jumped 2 to
1573/ i aDd National Starch preferred 2 to 52.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, In,, Feb. 15.â Still further weak
ness prevailed in the wheat market at the opening
this inornins. It was partly a continuation of the
toue which developed in the last l.our yesterday
and partly due to the weakness of Liverpool
cables. The sbiDments from both coasts the
week were not so great in volu me as it was ex
pected they would be, only 12,728,000 clearing,
against 2.290.000 bushels last week. .The receipts
In the Northwest were lighter than last Saturday,

PADEREWSKI INFATUATED.
Chinese Music Fills Him With
Wonder, Admiration and
Delight.
GREAT DRAMATIC STRENGTH.
The Distinguished Pianist Arouses In
terest in a Tour Through Darkest
Chinatown.
"This music infatuates me !' !
It was thus Paderewski spoke cf the ef
forts of the Chinese artists who are row â 
rilling every hole and cranny of the Chi
nese rookeries with the din of their unme
lodious but classic productions.
Not only in word, but in action, has the j
great pianist attested his admiration for
the ancient art of the Mongolians. For
three nights in succession he has quietly
walked through Chinatown feasting his
eyes and his ears. His la.st trip was made
last night.
"Oh, it is wonderful:" he said, stopping
where the full length of Dupont street j
could be seen. "This scer.e is different |
from anything T ever dreamed of."
1- was not till a little crowd had gath
ered, attracted by his striking personal
appearance, that the artist recalled himself
from his admiration nf the color effects
produced by the soft, glowing light of the
myriad lanterns! on the gayiy painted
house fronts. Every step brought forth
jiew ejaculations of delight and every
clangorous band held him.
"The art of the.Â«e people is glorious," he
paid. "We pee here the genius of 2500
years ago and not to-dny. Their primitive
colors please me as much as their music
and have much the same effect on my eye
that the music has on my ear."
"Then it is music?" was asked.
"Music," he answered, "music? Why,
it is wonderful music. I never saw more
dramatic expression put into tones. In
their plays fully half their effects are pro
duced by the orchestra. I could not
understand their words, but the music
told the story.
"And there were such splendid elimaxo?!
The musicians would play in low tones,
gradually increasing in force as the play
progressed. Then when a light was on or
a warrior killed, the music expressed the j
ideas of the actors perfectly. Then the
Ecene, being past, would be emphasized by j
proper music.
"What appealed to me most was the {
beautiful simplicity of it all and the cvi- !
dent art. There can be nodoubt.it is art," j
he asserted, when some one questioned I
the work of the musicians coming under
that head.
"It is art. too, that is the result of cen
turies of study. Those players do not
sing as they do without great study and
practice. Neither could the instrumen
talists produce the effects they do without
having been carefully trained."
The theater was a point of great inter
est to the wonderful musician. He sat in
a box at the side of the stage and exhib- 1
ited the greatest interest in everything, j
From time to time he would exclaim:
"Marvelous, marvelous! I 3 it not won
derful?" And as he sat with every
thought concentrated on the scene before
him it was odd to see that his fingers
moved as though they were going over a
keyboard.
The apparent utter indifference of the
musicians was a source of much specula
tion to Paderewski. The vacant stare in
which most of them indulged as they
drew forth from their primitive instru
ments tones that were of particularly
rasping harshness amused him greatly.
The man who elicited shrill shrieks from a
two-stringed fiddle with a head like a
small flattened cocoamit was the uncon
scious subject of much sincere admira
tion.
"That man has the artistic soul," de
clared the pianist. (i See how he leans
back, his eyes half closed, his whole being
PADEREWSKI LUXURIATES IN CELESTIAL MUSIC AT THE CHINESE THEATER.
[Sketched by a " CaU " artist. 1
wrapped up in his performance. Ah, and
how he does play! "What precision and
force you Jind there, and such expression,
too!"
The virtuoso's companions listened.
Then they smiled. Faderewski properly
interpreted this to mean unbelief, and
quickly answered:
"]t is thereâit is there. Listen for your
selves."
But the others would not s ee, and the
great pianist smiled. And he listened and
gazed. Then the fiddler solemnly un
crossed his legs and scratched one limb
against his chair, though he still gazed
ceilingward in the same rapt way.
He was not the only one who gazed,
though. The Chinese recognised Paderew
ski immediately. The word passed about
the house and every eye was riveted on
the srranger with the wonderful hair and
the still more wonderful reputation.
Both in the theatre and on the street
they were more polite than their white
brethren in satisfying their curiosity,
never obtruding themselves and only tak
ing side glances. They all seemed to
Know hirn^ and as many of the Chinese
read the daily papers, they were doubtless
well informed as to his many peculiarities.
Had there been any doubt as to the fact
of their knowledge of the identity of their
distinguished visitor it would have been
set aside by an incident that occurred in
one of the restaurants. A Chinese, dressed j
in rich clothes, advanced and with a bow j
presented Paerewski a card, savin;::
"You will pardon me, but will you |
kindly write your name on this?"
With a kindly smile the pianist said,
"Certainly." He sat down at one of the
tables, and as he wrote a gentleman asked
the Chinese:
"Do you know who he is ?"
"Why, of course," was the ready an
swer. "That is Paderewski. the man who
makes the piano sound like a singing
girl."
And he pronounced the Polish name
correctly.
Those who had heard the singing girls
did not doubt the sincerity of the compli
ment, though the value ol it wa9 not so
apparent.
AH the Chinese had not the same knowl
edge of Paderewski's talents. They seemed
to know that he was earning vast sums of I
money. One merchant, who said that he
read about the first concert to his wife,
said he would like to attend the perform
ance.
"Would they admit me?" he asked.
When told that it was probable that he ''â 
coulu purchase tickets he grew more inter
ested in the nature of the performance and
inquired:
'Is it a very exciting show? Are there!
any train wrecks or water scenes?"
He decided that he did not think he j
would get $3 worth from just hearing a
piano pla}'ed. In consequence it is prob
able that Paderewski's possible auditor
will not attend the Grand Opera-house.
In speaking of the Chinese music Pad- '
erewski said that it was one of the things
that had most interested him in his trip.
"lam going to study it more," he ex- !
plained, "before I can really tell you any- j
thing about it. It seems to me to combine !
many peculiarities of the Slavic and of the
Scotch music. The rhythm is perfect.
Through long bits of recitative the entire
orchestra rests, yet the measure is never
lost.
"It does not seem to matter particularly
whether the singers and the instruments
are in the same key or not. Frequently in
completing a speech the actors at the the
ater would change the key in which they
were delivering their parts. This aid not
bother them nor the orchestra a bit."
The temples of the Chinese were gazed
upon with reverence. The legends of the
Chinese gods were listened to with great
interest, for Paderewski is a most delightful
listener, and his questions in regard to the
curious carvings, the rich embroideries
and many odd bits of furniture and, above
all, the extreme respect which he displayed
for their sacred things, won him the re
gard of the Chinese from the first.
Of coarse the book of fates and the reeds
of fortune were consulted by the party.
Paderewski learned that the symbol lie
chose indicated a paragraph in the sacred
book which was favorable, since it told of
noble needs performed and good work ac
complished by the great King Chung, now
a god. Then Hugo Goerlitz, the pianist's
j manager and secretary, drew one of the

ALKALI LANDS.
Profemior HHgard in a Mechanic*' In
stitute Lecture Declares They May
Be Made Very Productive.
Professor E. W. Hilgard of the Univer
sity of California delivered a lecture in
the Mechanics' Institute course last
evening on "Desert Steppes and Alkali
Lands." The professsor said the great
American Desert has nearly all faded
J away. There is very little land in the
! United States that is not now known to be
reciainiable. Alkali in lands does not now
stamp it as worthless. On the contrary,
he said, the alkali lands will some day be
considered tli c most valuable, for it appears
that the soil in the arid regions is generally
deeuer than in the humid, it is only
necessary to eet rid of the alkali, or rather
prevent it from forming a crust on the
surface. The best way to do this is to
keep the soil in constant cultivation.
This keeps the alkali down. The land to
be made fertile must be irrigated, but to
deluge the land with water as has been
done in some instances he knew of in the
hope of working it out onJy seemed to bring
it in greater force to the surface. To wash i
it out it is necessary to subdrain the land.
This is the best way, but expensive. Sub
drainace also carries away many valuable
elements of the land. He would not ad
vise people to buy alkali lands, especially
unless they had capital, for in many in
stances they have proved discouraging to
settlers. But with proper treatment the
alkali can be subjugated and excellent re
sults secured. Speaking of tbe Moiave
Desert he said it should be called the M.o
jave plateauâ he had had the honor of so
naming it on a map to be circulated in
Europe, and as a result it was bo labeled
in other maps in Europe. â¢

MALTREATING A GODDESS
The City Hall Angel Has Been
Grossly Insulted by Proud
Man.
WAS UN WINGED IN INFANCY.
It Was Feared Her Pinions Might
Blow Down and Wake a
Night Watchman.
Since the massacre of the goddess to be
erected out ho pinnacle of the new City Hall
has begun there is no telling where it will
end. Only a few short days ago her wings
were pulled out by the roots, and she now
turns a cold pair of shoulders to the popu
lace. Five drug companies have cut in
bids for porous plasters, which will be put
on twenty- four hours before the unveiling
ceremonies.
Several weeks ago Marion Wells, the
designer, cave her an immense pair of
water-proof wings, warranted to keep in
any climate, but somebody discovered that
the wind might meet them in too merry a
mood, and some evening crack them short
off close up to the handles and fall upon
and kill a night watchman before he could
wake up.

When she was first planned it w as
thought that her wings would add beauty
and dignity to the grand dome, but when it
was considered that her moulting season
would bring disaster it was thought wise to
remove her wings altogether and keep her
down near terra firma.
"So what could the poor girl do?"
Artists, architects and sculptors all over
the City are very much interested in the
amputations, and it is the general impres
sion that her head will go off next, or per
haps an arm or a leg. Those who saw the
work adorned with its original wines say
that it was a noble construction and pos
sessed of a grandeur that is lost without
the angelic appurtenances. She now re
sembles a Greek slave without lodgings,
unable to pay her rent and driven iip on
the dome to avoid collectors.
The contractors look upon her as the last
brick in a long job. and she is practically
without friends. Her face has assumed a
cold metallic stare, and people who in- i
tended to feast their eyes upon her once I
benign countenance and admire the poise !
of her massive wings have decided to give
her the go-by. If popular opinion con
tinues to be inspired against her she will
not even be good advertising space, and
even Mr. Wells and the City Hall Com- !
missioners will refuse to look at her again, i
It is no easy matter to take an angel's I
wings off and keep her good wjll, even I
though the chance is thought best for her !
comfort and sanitary condition.
It is the old story of the downtrodden !
woman maltreated by man. When she '
started out in life it looked as though she ;
had good prospects to attract some atten- i
tion, but her future has been marred and '
her prospects ruined by weather cranks |
who believe that she was an obstruction to |
the sea breeze. Her hne feathers have i
been taken away and she is doomed to j
stand forever on the gilded ball and look
down in the midst of a population that
cheated her out of her physical attractions
and plucked her before she had a chance
to make a debut.

POKER-PLAYERS IN COURT
I Samuel M. Shortridge Argues
Against the New Ordi
nance.
Judge Low, After Hearing the Counsel,
Reserves His Decision Till
To-Morrow.
Judge Low's courtroom was crowded
I yesterday morning by poker-players and
I others to hear the argument of Samuel M.
! Shortridge against the poker-playing
ordinance.
Delmas & Shortridge and John E. Rich
ards, attorneys for the thirty-three de
j fendants, had interposed a demurrer to the
| complaint, and the argument of counsel
I was set for yesterday.
M/. Shortridge, in a well-considered
! argument, clearly pointed out that ac
l cording to the statutes poker is not a pro
| hibited game, but faro, roulette, rouge et
; noir, fantan and other games are made
â  misdemeanors, with a penalty of $500 tine
| or imprisonment equal thereto.
According to the municipal ordinance
I poker-playinjj la made a crime, and a pen
i alty for a violation of its provisions is a
line of $1000, with an alternative of im
prisonment, cr both.
Mr. Shortridge argued that the ordinance
is void, as it is in contravention of section
330 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the
penalty attached for the game of poker,
which is not prohibited by the statutes, is
more severe than ttie penalty for the pro
hibited games. The Board of Supervisors
had no right to make a crime of poker
playine, which when played for amuse
ment and not for money was an innocent
diversion and was not therefore pro
hibited by the statutes.
He also contended that the complaint
was defective, inasmuch as it did not state
sufficient facts to constitute a public
offense.
In support of his argument Mr. Short
ridge quoted numerous decisions and an
array of authorities showing that the game
of poker was never prohibited by the gen
eral laws of the State, and that no other
game was forbidden unless it was played
for money or some other representative of
value, and that this ordinance was in con
travention of the general course and policy
of the iaws of the State.
Attorney J. P. Dameron rose and ex
plained that he desired, as a friend of the
court, to say a few woixis ln'support of the
ordinance. H<? claimed that the Police
Court was not the proper tribunal in which
to argue the case, but U should have been
taken at once before the Supreme Court.
He argued that the Legislature was the
proper body to pass laws governing gam
bling and not the judiciary, which was en
croaching upon the rights of the legislative
body.
Mr. Shortridge took issue with the friend
of the court and argued that the Police
Court was as proper a tribunal to decide
upon the case as the highest court in the
land. He was inclined to deny that the
judiciary was encroaching upon the rights
of the legislative body, but that had noth
ing to do with the case before the court.
Prosecuting Attorney Madden and the
court seemed to admit the full force of
Mr. Shortridge's argument, but the Judge
reserved his decision till to-morrow.
